“DEAD BIRDS”
FADE IN
EXT CORNFIELD —- MORNING

The field is in a state of disrepair some plants yellowed
and rotting others growing outside of the weathered wooden
fence that surrounds the field Some patterns are still
apparent indicating that at one time the corn was planted in
rows

A wood house rests behind the field its shutters swaying
silently in the breeze The paint has peeled off the house
long ago if it was ever there and the outside of the house
has been bleached by the sun

In the field a scarecrow stands bound to a wooden cross
with twine This scarecrow is the only thing in the field
that looks as if it may have been tended to recently its
dark suit unfaded and neat

At the base of the scarecrow’s cross ants scurry up and down
the wooden pole teeming over each other

EXT BANK — DAY

The year is 1862 the second year of the American civil war
The bank a large plain building rests in the center of a
small southern town on the side of a wide dirt road A group
of six Confederate soldiers in gray uniforms ride down the
street on well-groomed horses towards the bank

INT BANK — DAY

Four of the six soldiers enter the bank the middle two each
carrying two bags The bank’s counter has two barred windows
one of which is already occupied by an attractive young woman
in an expensive dress who is speaking intently with the
teller a young awkward man The four soldiers cross to the
other window

The old male teller at this window looks at the soldiers
surprised as two of them set their bags heavily on the
counter

TALL SOLDIER
Your manager in

The elderly teller nods

TALL SOLDIER (CONT’D)
Go get him

( )

The soldiers wait looking around the bank as the teller
hurries away behind the window Aside from themselves and the
woman at the other window there are no other customers in
the bank A rough-looking man stands next to the door a
large four-chamber revolver stuck prominently into his belt
obviously representing security

A door in the wall rattles and a middle-aged man steps out
wearing spectacles He moves towards the soldiers
solicitously the old teller following him The tall soldier
looks at the man levelly

TALL SOLDIER (CONT’D)
You MacCready

MACCREADY
Yes I am Fred MacCready’s my name How
may I help you gentlemen

TALL SOLDIER
Corporal Williams said you might have a
place where we could put this

He indicates the bags

MACCREADY
(hesitates)
Did the corporal give you any message for
me

The tall soldier takes a folded piece of paper from his
pocket and hands it to MacCready MacCready unfolds the paper
and nervously looks at it

EXT BANK — DAY

The two other Confederate soldiers are standing outside the
bank looking around while one of them feeds the horses The
other soldier blonde and covered with dust standing a few
feet away looks down the dirt street

A few hundred feet away four more Confederate soldiers are
riding horses towards them moving slowly A black man leads
one of their horses walking on foot A medium-sized dog
trots alongside him

The blonde soldier seeing this turns to his companion

BLONDE SOLDIER
Hey look at that

The other soldier looks up from his task squinting
revealing bad teeth

( )

BUCKTOOTH SOLDIER
Who the hell are they

BLONDE SOLDIER
I don’t know

The blonde soldier turns and faces the oncoming gray
soldiers waving

INT BANK — DAY

MacCready faces the four soldiers inside the bank cheerful
pocketing the note

MACCREADY
Well it looks like everything’s in
order then You understand my having to
check Security these days

The tall soldier looks at him unsmiling
TALL SOLDIER
You got a safe we should be taking this
to
MACCREADY
The best in the state But first I’1ll

need you to sign for this

TALL SOLDIER

Why
MACCREADY
(faltering)
Well I mean you will want a receipt

for it won’t you

TALL SOLDIER
Oh Yeah sure

MacCready looks at the elderly teller gesturing towards the
counter The teller shuffles away

EXT BANK — DAY

The four soldiers on horseback approach the two soldiers
outside the bank The man in front with his horse being lead
by the black man has dark hair and eyes and is chewing
tobacco This is WILLIAM

The black man TODD is slender and watches the two

soldiers unblinking The blonde soldier addresses William
somewhat hesitantly

( )

BLONDE SOLDIER
Where you men in from

William slides off his horse landing on his feet and ties
the horse’s reins to a wooden post in front of the bank The
three men on horseback behind him do the same

One of these men is SAM who looks like a younger version of
William and is also chewing tobacco The other two are
JOSEPH a large wide-shouldered man and CLYDE a smaller
wiry rugged man The four move towards the two soldiers
friendly

WILLIAM
Camp just over that way about two miles
east near the swamps

BUCKTOOTH SOLDIER
(somewhat suspiciously)
Who’s your lieutenant over there

WILLIAM
Ain’t got no lieutenant right now
Cap’ain Louison’s around though

The two soldiers relax slightly at this response William
taps Todd on the shoulder roughly

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Go help the men with their horses boy

Todd shoots him a quick look then walks over to the two
soldiers’ horses head bowed The bucktooth soldier hands him
the feed bag

BUCKTOOTH SOLDIER
What’re you doing here in town

WILLIAM
(gestures)
Got some business at the bank

BLONDE SOLDIER
Well you’re gonna have to wait a few
minutes

William squints up at the sun

WILLIAM
Nope Can’t wait

William begins moving towards the bank Sam Joseph and Clyde
follow

( )

BLONDE SOLDIER
(steps forward nervous)
No I mean you really gotta We can’t
let anyone in there right now It’1ll just
be a few minutes though

The four men do not pause continuing towards the door to the
bank The blonde soldier and the bucktooth soldier exchange
quick glances then the blonde soldier draws his rifle
cocking the hammer and leveling it at the William

BLONDE SOLDIER (CONTD)
Now stop right-

He is cut off as the blade of a thick knife enters his neck
Todd spins tugging the knife out of the blonde soldier’s

throat releasing a spout of blood and stabs the bucktooth
soldier in the chest before the bucktooth soldier can react

Todd looks up at William stooping over the body of the
bucktooth soldier William nods and Todd leans over and
picks up the blonde soldier’s rifle then begins untying the
horses William opens the doors to the bank

INT BANK — DAY

MacCready and one of the other soldiers are carrying the four
bags behind the counter when William and his men burst into
the bank drawing guns

Joseph grabs the security guard as the man reaches for his
revolver They struggle for a moment then Joseph breaks the
guard’s neck dropping him to the floor and pulls out a gun
William aims his pistols at the men with the bags

WILLIAM
Hold it there

MacCready and the soldiers freeze The tall soldier pulls his
rifle from a holster at his bag swinging it towards William
Sam leans over aiming his pistol and shoots the tall
soldier in the head

William empties his guns hitting both MacCready and the
other soldier as Clyde and Joseph shoot the other two
soldiers

The elderly teller the young teller and the girl are still
standing staring Slowly the younger teller reaches under
the counter The girl standing across from him sees this
She flips a straight razor out of her sleeve leans forward
and cuts the teller’s throat The young teller falls back
spraying the girl with blood

( )

The soldier who was moving the bags with MacCready is
twitching on the ground gasping still alive William and
Clyde both notice this Clyde begins pouring gun powder from
a paper packet into the barrel of his pistol but William
sighs steps forward and takes out a hunting knife He walks
over to the soldier and stabs him in the chest

William stands up surveying the room His eyes meet the
girl’s and he smiles

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Hey there

William moves over to the girl ANNABELLE and they kiss She
wipes her razor clean on her dress then tucks it back into
her sleeve The young teller lies still on the opposite side
of the counter
SAM
Quick work Annabelle You cut him I
didn’t even see it

WILLIAM
Alright anyone else still alive in here

Clyde gestures at the elderly teller who is backed away from
them in a corner trembling and pale

CLYDE
Him sort of

William begins loading one of his pistols

WILLIAM
Well kill him

Clyde aims his pistol at the elderly teller

ELDERLY TELLER
No please don’t

The teller chokes then clutches at his chest His eyes roll
up into his head and he falls to his knees then to the
floor his eyes closing The teller lies still on the floor

Clyde looks at William frowning then turns back towards the
elderly teller’s prone body and shoots him

CLYDE
Just in case

Joseph and Sam are holding the four bags

( )

WILLIAM
Those heavy Joseph

Joseph nods excited

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Well then let’s get the hell out of
here

EXT BANK — DAY

Todd is standing in front of the bank with his gun drawn his
other hand holding all six of the soldiers’ horses by the
reins He warily looks up and down the street The dog stands
next to Todd indifferent

People are watching Todd and the bank but nobody is doing
anything Most people have run into buildings to hide but
the rest are watching Todd unnaturally He returns their
gaze looking from face to face

William Annabelle Clyde Joseph and Sam come running out of
the bank Todd turns to them lifting the dog up into a
saddlebag on one of the horses

TODD
About fucking time

They each leap up onto a horse grabbing the reins and taking
their horses off down the street at a gallop Ahead of them
three men in Confederate uniforms run out of a grocery store
aiming rifles

ANNABELLE
Oh hell

Clyde William and Todd begin shooting at the soldiers as
they ride past One of the soldiers is hit falling back
Behind him a woman screams Next to her a very small boy is
lying on the ground blood all over his face and neck
Everything grows still for a moment as William sees this

William flinches and looks away from the boy as the six
thunder past the grocery store Then they are down the street
and gone as the two remaining soldiers run around the street
corner after their horses The woman kneels over the small
boy in the street weeping

EXT PLAIN - DAY
The six ride their horses quickly Sam next to William The

dog is riding in Sam’s saddlebag and Sam feeds it a piece of
dried beef

( )

SAM
Good boy Dog
(to William)
How many do you think’1l be after us

WILLIAM
Not many right away and those’d be the
only that could catch up in time to find
us

William looks over at Sam who has a dark circle of blood
growing on his shoulder over a hole in the shirt

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Youre hit

Sam looks where William is looking down at his own shoulder

SAM
Just in the shoulder I don’t think it’s
real bad I can move it around okay it
ain’t near the bone or nothing We’1ll get
it out later

William looks like he wants to say more but turns away and
urges his horse on faster

EXT FOREST - AFTERNOON

The six carefully work their way through a dim wooded area
carefully guiding their horses through trees Sam’s shirt
sleeve is red with blood but the bleeding seems to have
stopped and Sam is greedily eating an apple

Annabelle and William ride near the front conversing
quietly Annabelle is holding a compass watching the needle
sway Todd moves his horse up next to them

TODD
We lost

WILLIAM
No We got a couple more miles of this
though then we’ll reach a small stream
should be easy to cross Then we stay on
a road through a few fields and we should
be at the place we’re staying by
nightfall After that day and a half’s
ride to Mexico

Todd is silent for a moment

( )

TODD
Who runs this place we’re staying at
tonight
WILLIAM
No one
TODD
No one
WILLIAM

When I was staying at the Union hospital
up near Chatsville getting some metal
bits pulled out of my arm by the most
beautiful nurse in the world

(he looks at Annabelle who

ignores him)
-I was put next to this soldier just a
kid really had a gut wound somebody put
there with a bayonet We talked all the
day got to know each other pretty good
he was a right enough sort Around the
end when he was starting to get pretty
sick all the time

Annabelle looks up at them

ANNABELLE
The bile in his guts spread

WILLIAM

Yeah That it did Kid told me about this
place he inherited down south big ‘ol
house couple hundred acres he got it
from some great-uncle he never knew He
gave me pretty good directions to the
place he didn’t have no family or a girl
or nothing and said he wanted me to join
up with him if he ever made it down
there Kid planned to get rich off
farming He wasn’t too bright

(shrugs)
He died a couple of days after that

ANNABELLE
(almost to herself)
His name was Jeffy Jeffy Hollister He
was a good kid He used to call me
‘Belle

WILLIAM
Yeah I remember that
(pause)
(MORE )

( ) WILLIAM (CONTD)

So anyway I guess you could say the
place we’re headed to is mine Or
anyone’s who wants it anyway

TODD

What if some folks moved in there
WILLIAM

It’s in the middle of nowhere I figure

if we drop the name Jeffy Hollister
whoever’s living there might show some
hospitality If they don’t well we’1ll
have to take care of them either way
It’s a place to stay

They ride in silence for a moment The forest overcast with
trees is growing darker

TODD
How’s your brother doing

William glances over at Sam

WILLIAM
He’s fine for now We’ll get the bullet
out when we reach the house Annabelle
can take care of that After that he
should be good

The group is silent as they continue through the trees
Something moves in a thick bush as they move past and Joseph
jumps startled A bird’s harsh unidentifiable cry comes
from the bush Clyde laughs at Joseph

CLYDE
Whoa Joseph stay on your horse there
big guy Just a crow or something

JOSEPH
(embarrassed)
You better shut up
Clyde smiles but is silent
EXT DIRT ROAD - EVENING
The sun is setting as the six make their way down a narrow
dirt road corn fields on either side of them The rows of

corn cast the field in shadow so that the road ahead is
dark

At the front of the group William and Annabelle speak
quietly

( )

WILLIAM
I think I killed a kid Back in the town
Did you see it

ANNABELLE
Yeah I thought I saw him fall You sure
that was you Could’ve been anyone

WILLIAM
I think it was me

ANNABELLE
Why

WILLIAM
I don’t know
(pause)
Don’t tell the others If they didn’t
notice they shouldn’t know

Annabelle is silent for a moment thinking

ANNABELLE
We almost there

William nods

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
We’re not lost are we I haven’t seen a
house for awhile

WILLIAM
They’re back there It’s along this road
we just gotta go until we find it

ANNABELLE
It’s getting dark soon Too many clouds
for the moon to do us any good

WILLIAM
I know it

Up ahead a clanking sound comes The six immediately slow
their horses moving quietly

CLYDE
(speaking softly to Todd)
What’s that

TODD
I don’t know You got a lantern

William’s eyes are narrowed and cold

( )

WILLIAM
Don’t Hold up a bit

The six ride forward in the dark very slowly reaching the
top of a small hill The noises from ahead are now more
regular and the sound of a horse’s footfall can be
distinguished from a regular creaking sound

Further along the path in the darkness ahead a dim light
becomes visible The light sways back and forth slightly
moving towards them The dog Dog looks up and growls
slightly Sam puts a hand on Dog to silence him

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
(whispering)
You see that

Annabelle draws out her pistol

ANNABELLE
Yeah

The group has grown silent watching the bobbing light move
closer

CLYDE
Will-o’-wisps

TODD
We ain’t near no swamp

CLYDE
Ain’t unheard of

ANNABELLE
It looks like a lantern

WILLIAM
Sam

SAM
Yeah

WILLIAM

Give us some light here

SAM
You sure

WILLIAM
Come on

( )

Sam strikes a match on his thumbnail and holds it to a soot-
caked lantern lighting the wick The lantern fizzles then
glows brightly illuminating a large black horse several
yards in front of the group They all jump

CLYDE
Shit

The horse continues walking passively towards them As it
moves closer the carriage that the horse is pulling becomes
visible A lantern and several pots pans and other
unidentifiable objects hang from the roof of the carriage An
old man sits at the front behind the horse silent

William clears his throat and addresses the old man

WILLIAM
Excuse me

The man does not respond Joseph stirs on his horse
uneasily William speaks louder

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Excuse me

The old man draws back on the horse’s reins The horse grunts
softly and comes to a stop The old man turns to face
William his eyes looking beyond him The old man has no
pupils his eyes are pale blue washed clean by glaucoma

OLD MAN
Who’s that
WILLIAM
I uh Say we’re looking for the

Hollister place Is it far from here

OLD MAN
Hollister
(shakes his head)
Never heard of it

The old man turns away lifting the horse’s reins

WILLIAM
(surprised)
Are you sure It’s a large farm should
be just up the road Right after a creek

OLD MAN
There’s no creek around here Not for
miles

(MORE )

( ) OLD MAN(CONTD)

(pause)
Sorry I couldn’t help you

The old man lashes the reins and the horse starts forward
again easily pulling the carriage into motion William and
his group sit silently pensive

As the carriage moves past them Sam’s lantern reveals a boy
standing inside the carriage looking out at them through an
oblong window cut into the side of the carriage The boy
appears to be mentally disabled and watches them completely
without movement or expression

After a moment the carriage is past the group its lantern
light fading into the darkness of the road behind them

Todd spits tobacco juice into the cornfield as Joseph coughs
uneasily Annabelle and Sam look at William who kicks at the
side of his horse

WILLIAM
Well come on then

Annabelle and Sam immediately follow him Todd Joseph and
Clyde exchange glances then head after William one by one

EXT DIRT ROAD - EVENING

The road is getting narrower and increasingly covered with
tall grass bent down in some areas but seemingly untouched
in others Annabelle and William can barely ride alongside
each other Sam is riding in front of them slowly with Dog
running alongside Sam’s horse visible in the lantern’s
circle of light

ANNABELLE
I don’t like the looks of this

WILLIAM
We’ve slept on grass before

ANNABELLE
We don’t even know where we are

WILLIAM
Weve got our compasses
(he nods over to his left)
Mexico’s that way

Up ahead Sam’s horse suddenly comes to a dead stop William

and Annabelle tug on their horses’ reins quickly to avoid
running into him causing their horses to rear up slightly

( )

SAM
Hey

CLYDE
(tense)
What is it

SAM
Well look at this

Sam lifts up his lantern in front of him as the others crowd
around him taking their horses into the field which is
suddenly thin and rocky A creek about fifteen feet wide
bubbles in front of them its waters black by the lantern
light

TODD
Well what the hell

SAM
(to Dog)
Cmere girl

Sam lifts Dog up into his saddlebag then rides out into the
creek The water though moving at a good speed is only
about a foot and a half deep William nudges his horse
forward into the water looking down

WILLIAM
Shit Crazy old man

William begins riding forward across the creek

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Come on It shouldn’t be far from here

The rest of the group follow him forward along the trail
EXT FARM - EVENING

The trail forks up ahead Perhaps there was a path to the
house once but if so the path was long ago consumed by the
thick corn fields that surround the house on all sides In
front of the house the yard is so crowded with tall grass
and weeds that it appears to be a field itself

The house sits on the horizon just visible by the final
orange rays of the sun There is a stone well to the side of
the house and clotheslines hang at angles just beyond this
well Behind the house is a tall barn almost as big as the
house itself

( )

William Annabelle and Sam are the first to see the house
and they stand in the road waiting for the other three to
catch up The house a dark silhouette by the sun setting

behind it presents something of an ominous sight William
wets his lips with his tongue

SAM
Well Looks like a nice place

Sam climbs off his horse holding its reins The horse shies
away and Sam pets it hushing it Annabelle and William also
climb off their horses

Annabelle watches the house carefully In one of the windows
of the house a previously indistinguishable shape suddenly
shifts and disappears from the window Annabelle seeing
this involuntarily takes a step back

WILLIAM
What is it

ANNABELLE
I
(considers)
I saw something in one of the windows

SAM
I’m sure there was something in one of
the windows That whole place has got to
be filled with all kinds of critters
Probably saw a bird or something

WILLIAM
(to Annabelle)
Something or someone

ANNABELLE
Someone Like they was watching us

William looks at the house as Clyde Todd and Joseph ride up
behind them

WILLIAM
Well be careful

William steps out into the cornfield pushing the stalks
apart with one hand holding his horse’s reins with the
other

Suddenly a creature with glowing eyes leaps out at William
from the field squealing The creature is about the size of
a large raccoon William shouts and spins to the side as the
creature runs past him

( )

Just as it passes William the creature is knocked onto its
back by a gunshot Sam holds a smoking gun frowning down at
the creature Dog begins growling

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ

TODD
What the hell is that

The creature has soft white fur on its stomach but has a pig-
like snout long claws and a bald pink tail The hair on

its back is thick and bristled The creature shakes for a
moment bleeding from its back its legs pivoting then is
still Dog quiets down

SAM
It looks like some kind of giant rat

TODD
Yeah right Did you see its eyes

SAM
How do you think I knew where to shoot
at

Annabelle softly walks over to the creature and kicks its
side barely The creature is still

SAM (CONTD)
(to William)
You all right
William stiffens slightly regaining his composure
WILLIAM
Yeah I’m fine That thing gave me a
start that’s all

TODD
It ain’t breathing

WILLIAM
Well that’s good news What is it

CLYDE
Kinda looks like a porcupine Or a pig

TODD
Built almost like a baby bear a little

( )

JOSEPH
Maybe a porcupine and a muskrat had a
kid

Clyde looks at Joseph quickly to see if he is kidding

CLYDE
Yeah maybe

WILLIAM
Well let’s get going

William steps back towards the cornfield Everyone looks at
him hesitantly Williams moves towards the cornfield then
when no one follows turns back sardonically towards the
group

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Hey Sam

SAM
Yeah

WILLIAM
Keep your eyes out for more of those
things alright

William turns and walks into the cornfield Sam follows then
Todd then Annabelle and the rest leading their horses

EXT CORNFIELD - EVENING

The six work their way through the dark cornfield pushing
unruly stalks to the side Sam Joseph and Todd each hold
lanterns which do little good in the dense cornfield except
to create alarming shadows The horses make nervous sounds
every now and then but continue forward

Suddenly Annabelle up ahead gives a sharp cry Joseph Todd
and Clyde rush forward towards the sound of her voice

Annabelle is standing one hand on her chest in front of a
scarecrow The scarecrow’s limbs are tied to a wooden cross
with barbed wire A canvas sack filled with peculiar lumps
and shadows forms the scarecrow’s head Joseph looks up at
it

WILLIAM

(annoyed)
Oh what the hell

( )

ANNABELLE
That thing scared the life out of me I
thought it was a man

SAM
It’s creepy alright

Todd and Clyde stare up at the scarecrow skeptically Dog
stands next to him Joseph sniffs the air

JOSEPH
What smells funny

TODD
(to Annabelle)
You want us to take it down

ANNABELLE
No Don’t touch it I mean there’s no
point Let’s not bother It just gave me
a start that’s all

TODD
All right

William coughs and spits

WILLIAM
(sarcastic)
Yes it’s a very frightening scarecrow
If I were a crow Id go elsewhere Since
I’m not anyone else want to get a move
on

Annabelle looks down embarrassed William rolls his eyes at
her and the group moves past the scarecrow Dog and Joseph
give it a wide berth and the horses make nervous noises as
they pass

SAM
What direction is the house in Hey
Joseph can you see the house

JOSEPH
Not over this corn Want me to climb up
on my horse

SAM

William you know what direction we’re
headed in

William looks back at him then points ahead to the left

( )

WILLIAM
The house is that way

SAM
You sure I would’ve thought we’d be
there by now

WILLIAM
Cornfields always look smaller before
you’re fighting your way through them

SAM
I guess that’s about right

They work their way through the field One of the horses

whinnies

SAM (CONTD)
Damn it’s quiet

TODD
I know

Clyde is in the lead gruffly shoving his way through the

cornstalks

- He suddenly stumbles out of the cornfield and

finds himself facing the house

The house is worn its boards bleached by exposure to the
elements The windows are dark The front door leans open

The others

CLYDE
Well hell

stumble up behind Clyde

WILLIAM
Well there it is

CLYDE
Yeah

William looks around Nobody is moving

WILLIAM
Come on then

William walks over to a twisted oak tree leaning several
feet in front of the house and ties his horse to a hanging
branch William’s horse shuffles slightly rolling its eyes
William consoles it

( )

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Shhh girl We’ll get you some water ina
bit

TODD
The horses are acting weird

WILLIAM
Of course they are They’re horses
They’re stupid and crazy

TODD
Huh Well someone should rub them down
later if they’re gonna be any good
tomorrow

JOSEPH
I’1l do it I don’t mind

The rest of the group tie their horses to the tree William
moves over towards the house the others follow Sam takes a
step forward then quickly steps back looking at the ground

SAM
Hell

ANNABELLE
What

SAM

I just stepped on a bird

A dead slightly decayed bird rests on the ground Sam
examines the sole of his boot

SAM (CONTD)
That’s a first

Sam looks around Another dead bird rests on the ground a
few feet away Dog sniffs at it

SAM (CONTD)
Look there’s another one

Annabelle is clearly not very interested in this

ANNABELLE
Huh

SAM

There must be like cats around here or
something

( )

ANNABELLE
Yeah Come on I want to get that bullet
out of you before an infection can start
spreading

SAM
Sure thing
(to Dog)
Come on Dog

Sam follows Annabelle up towards the house Dog after a
moment trots after him

EXT HOUSE PORCH -— EVENING

William steps up onto the wooden porch As Joseph steps up
next to him the boards beneath them creak ominously Joseph
and William look at each other then William takes Josephs
lantern and steps into the house

Todd looks back at the horses tied to the oak tree The
horses are silent Todd moves up onto the porch

INT HOUSE FRONT ROOM - EVENING

William’s lantern illuminates the front room of the house A
wooden table sits over in a corner of the room surrounded by
several chairs A thick layer of dust covers nearly
everything

Joseph begins to step forward into the room but William puts
a hand across Joseph’s chest stopping him Joseph looks at
William questioningly

William points the lantern down at the floor Two pairs of
footprints are imprinted in the dust on the wooden floor
large boot prints The boot prints lead off into the darkness
of the house

Clyde and Todd have moved in behind William and Joseph

CLYDE
What’s going on

Clyde sees the footprints on the floor and is quiet
TODD
It’s probably just some tramps I’d
settle here if I was them Let’s look
around and find ‘em

William looks at Todd

( )

TODD (CONTD)
There’s only two of them

WILLIAM
(nods )
Alright But everyone be careful

They move into the house followed by Sam and Annabelle Dog
trots in with them looking around Dog’s ears are up

Joseph immediately crosses over to the wooden table and drops
the four bags The table creaks One of the bags comes open
slightly and a few gold coins spill out onto the table

Joseph looks at the gold then picks a coin up and bites it
He examines his tooth marks in the gold

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Don’t chew on the gold Joseph

Joseph quickly puts the coin back down on the table William
addresses the group

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Let’s split up into pairs search this
floor and the upstairs And the cellar
if this place has one

TODD
They might be out in that old barn That
looked big enough

WILLIAM
We’1l check that after we finish with the
house

William steps further into the house shining his lantern
around A kitchen area with a coal stove is barely visible
through a doorway the corners of the kitchen are dark

ANNABELLE
I want to get to work on Sam’s shoulder
right away

WILLIAM
Yeah That’s a good idea

SAM
It’s fine It can wait

WILLIAM

Oh yeah little brother Bullets just
bounce off you now huh

( )

Sam grins at William

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Clyde and Joseph you guys take the
upstairs Todd and I will check this
floor

Clyde and Joseph nod and walk off William looks over at Dog
who is staring around the room

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Hey you want to come with us Sniff
something out

Dog looks at William then slinks under a chair and curls up

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
That’s thing’s goddamn useless Sam
Alright then

William and Todd begin moving away

ANNABELLE
(to William)
Be careful

WILLIAM
You too Sam keep a hand on your gun I
don’t want anybody sneaking up on us
tramps or no

SAM
Don’t worry about that

WILLIAM
I’m sure they’ve seen our lanterns by
now so they might come looking for us

SAM
Maybe we scared them off

WILLIAM
If they’ve been staying here Not likely

William and Todd walk into the kitchen Annabelle sets her
lantern down on the table turning it up so that the room
grows brighter She beckons Sam over to a chair he sits

Annabelle begins fiddling through a satchel pulling out

tools as Sam unbuttons and peels off his shirt He winces as
his shoulder stretches

( )

ANNABELLE
Leave it on we’ll just move it aside

Annabelle pushes Sam’s shirt open over his shoulders
exposing his torso The bullet wound in Sam’s shoulder is
very dark almost black and moist with purple blood A
large bluish welt surrounds the wound Annabelle winces when
she sees the wound

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
Jesus

Annabelle gently presses on the swollen area of flesh that
surrounds the bullet hole Dark blood almost black wells
out of the scabby wound and crawls down Sam’s chest
Sam curious peers down trying to see his own shoulder
SAM
Yeah that doesn’t look too good does
it

INT KITCHEN - EVENING

William and Todd look around the kitchen Todd opens the
stove and sifts the ashes inside

TODD
This hasn’t been used anytime soon

WILLIAM
Huh

William is looking at the counter where a dirty cloth doll
lies its limbs askew One of the doll’s button eyes is
missing

TODD
Let’s keep moving

WILLIAM
Yeah

INT STAIRWAY TO SECOND FLOOR - EVENING

Clyde and Joseph cautiously make their way up the stairs
Joseph in the lead

CLYDE

This is a pretty nice place Real fancy
Guy who built it must have been rich

( )

They reach the top of the stairwell and find themselves in a
short hallway with three doors one in front of them the
other two at opposite ends of the hallway

JOSEPH
Think those guys are up here

CLYDE
Maybe Don’t worry they’1ll take one look
at you and wet themselves big guy

JOSEPH
I could crush them

CLYDE
I know it Here you go check that room
down there and I’11 check this one

JOSEPH
Okay

INT CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Joseph moves down the hallway away from Clyde Joseph opens
the door at the end of the hall and walks slowly into the
room

Joseph looks around the sparse bedroom Two small beds rest
against one wall There is a dresser in the room and a
closet

Joseph carefully walks into the room checking behind the
beds Nothing is there He moves over to the closet door
somewhat nervous

Joseph turns the doorknob slowly and opens the closet door
shining his lantern in The closet has a few sets of
children’s clothes including a small dress The hanging
clothes cast dark shadows inside the closet

Joseph pushes the clothes apart to determine that nothing is
behind them He breathes a slight sigh of relief when he sees
nothing but wall and walks back through the bedroom

Just as Joseph reaches the doorway to the bedroom a slight
scratching sound comes from within the room Joseph stops and
turns around holding the lantern out He appears to be alone
in the bedroom

JOSEPH
Is anyone there

( )

There is no response Joseph narrows his eyes looking at the
beds He crouches down to peer under them but it is too dark
to see under the beds from the door Joseph rises to a
standing position A dark figure is standing behind him

Joseph starts and whirls around to face Clyde who jumps
back

CLYDE
Shit
JOSEPH
Oh man You scared me

Clyde pauses as they both catch their breath

CLYDE
Yeah this place makes me a little jumpy
too Nothing in there

JOSEPH

Nah nothing Anything in yours

CLYDE
Just some weird clothes and stuff Looks
like it was a guest room or something
that no one ever used the bed’s still
made
(pause)
Let’s check the third room together

JOSEPH
Okay

Clyde and Joseph walk down the hallway
INT SITTING ROOM - EVENING

William stands in a room shining his lantern around The
room features a large black piano covered with dust A few
plush chairs are lined against one wall Stacks of sheet
music are piled on a small table

Moving forward William sees that a dirty picture frame is
propped up against the side of the piano its back facing
outward William reaches out and turns the picture frame
over directing his lantern light onto it

The picture on the front of the frame is of a man seated ina
chair with what appears to be two small boys and a very
young girl standing around him facing forward The four
figures are all clad in formal attire

( )

It is a very traditional family portrait but it does not
seem to have been fully finished giving the portrait an
eerie quality the facial features of the children are
absent as if the artist never got around to the details on
their likenesses and the man’s facial expression looks
inappropriately somber William stares at the portrait eyes
narrowed and the man’s image on the canvas gazes back out at
him

William nervously looks behind him into the darkness

WILLIAM
Hey Todd get a look at this

There is no response A creaking sound comes from the
darkness just outside the doorway then silence

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Todd

TODD (0S)
Yeah

William reacts to Todd’s voice with visible relief

WILLIAM
What are you doing

TODD (0S)
There’s a door here I’m trying to get it
open

William moves forward towards Todd’s voice
INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING

William moves into a hallway where Todd has his shoulder
braced against a thick wooden door

TODD
This looks like it might go down to a
fruit cellar or something it’s in the
right place for it

WILLIAM
You can’t get it open

TODD
Nah it’s like there’s something up
against it

William places his lantern on the floor and moves to the
door next to Todd

( )

They brace themselves against the door and try to force it
open straining against the door The door bends but does not
give

WILLIAM
Hell

They stop trying Todd stretches his back

TODD
It doesn’t feel like it’s locked or
anything though the door gives near the
handle

WILLIAM
Yeah We’ll get Joseph back here see if
he can force it Failing that we’ll chop
it down Wouldn’t want anyone to have
barricaded themselves in there
especially if we’re going to get any
sleep tonight

TODD
Yeah

Todd puts his head against the door listening then taps on
it with his hand

WILLIAM
Come on let’s get back and see how Sam’s
doing

TODD
Sure

INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

Annabelle pulls a small lump of metal out from Sam’s
shoulder using a pair of thin pliers Sam grits his teeth
his eyes clenched shut

ANNABELLE
There We’re done

Sam opens his eyes relaxing slightly Red blood flows from
his wound He reaches forward grabs a bottle of whiskey from
the table and drinks deeply from it

Sam stops drinking to gasp

SAM
Christ

( )

ANNABELLE
Hopefully that’1l help matters

SAM
You got anything to bandage it up with

ANNABELLE
Just a second

Annabelle takes the bottle of whiskey from him and takes a
quick drink She then bends forward and pours whiskey onto
his wound Sam jerks away

SAM
Shit Ow

Annabelle takes another drink of whiskey then passes the
bottle back over to Sam who stares at her resentfully

ANNABELLE
That’1l do

Annabelle pulls out some cotton bandages and begins lacing
them over Sam’s shoulder

SAM
You could’ve told me you were going to do
that

ANNABELLE

Quit whining

Sam tenderly touches his shoulder still wincing His face is
flushed and covered with sweat

Annabelle suddenly turns towards a window which faces
outside

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
Did you see that

Sam turns following her gaze The window is completely dark

SAM
What

ANNABELLE
I thought I saw someone standing on the
porch
(pause)
It might have just been my reflection

Sam tightens his grip on his pistol watching the window

( )

SAM
Yeah

Both Annabelle and Sam look over at the front door which is

slightly open A breeze moves the front door open a few
inches

Behind them William and Todd walk into the room William
nods over to Sam

WILLIAM
How you doing

Sam glances over at William surprised

SAM
Just splendid

WILLIAM
(to Annabelle)
Were you able to get it out

ANNABELLE
Yeah It’s weird It wasn’t that deep

TODD
We should start lighting these lanterns
around here

Todd indicates two lanterns mounted on the wall

WILLIAM
Yeah good idea

Todd moves over and lights the two lanterns which flare
immediately to life

TODD
They’ve still got oil in them

WILLIAM
Good

The front door creaks open further Everyone in the room
looks at this nervously and the lanterns flicker slightly

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Fucking wind

Sam rises to his feet and crosses over to the door holding

one hand over his bandage

EXT PORCH - EVENING

Sam steps out onto the porch and looks around There is
nothing on the porch It is almost completely dark outside
and he can see very little He squints into the darkness
then turns and walks back into the front room

INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

Joseph and Clyde walk into the room from the kitchen at the
same time as Sam dimming their lanterns as they enter Clyde
has something slung over his arm Annabelle and William turn
to regard them

CLYDE
Look what we found in a bedroom upstairs

He holds out the object It is a gray Confederate army
jacket Everyone regards this silently Sam sits back down
across Annabelle a pensive expression on his face

SAM
Deserters

WILLIAM
Maybe Did you find anything else

CLYDE
Nothing important This was hung over a
bedpost

WILLIAM

That changes matters

CLYDE
They might have just moved on

WILLIAM
Maybe Why would they leave their jacket

CLYDE
Probably ‘cause they found a better one
There’s plenty of clothes upstairs If
youre a deserter sometimes the best
idea isn’t to go around in your army
uniform

William nods
SAM

Still we should check out that barn now
just to be sure

( )

CLYDE
I agree

Clyde pulls out a pistol and cocks it He grins over at Todd

CLYDE (CONT’D)
You want to go hunting

Todd shrugs

TODD
It’s nothing to me

WILLIAM
Regardless of whether we find anything
well sleep in shifts tonight I know
I’1l sleep better knowing someone’s on
watch We’ll keep the lanterns on in this
room so someone can stay up

SAM
Ill take the first shift I’m not tired

WILLIAM
Okay

Dog underneath the chair begins edging forward its hackles
rising Dog is looking at an empty corner of the room Nobody
notices Dog

TODD
This place isn’t exactly turning out to
be the safe haven we hoped for

WILLIAM
I know it We’1ll move on at first light
tomorrow

Dog begins growling at the empty corner of the room Dog
quickly looks over at the open front door of the house then
looks back at the corner slowly backing away

TODD
What the hell

Dog continues growling and edging away from whatever has its
attention in the corner William and Clyde move over to stare
at the corner of the room from Dog’s angle

CLYDE
Do you see anything over there

( )

WILLIAM
Nope

SAM
(to Dog)
What the hell’s wrong with you

Dog does not acknowledge Sam Suddenly Dog leaps back with a
yelp turns and runs out of the house Sam rises to his feet
moving after Dog

SAM (CONTD)
Hey Dog Get back here

Sam steps forward but clutches his shoulder wincing

SAM (CONT’D)
Damn

Annabelle moves over to Sam

ANNABELLE
You alright

SAM
Yeah I’m fine I just got a little
dizzy there Let me sit down

Sam sits back in his chair Clyde and William move outside
William turning up his lantern

EXT HOUSE PORCH -— EVENING

The yard is completely dark The lantern barely illuminates
the cornstalks that surround the house Clyde moves down the
porch steps calling out

CLYDE
Dog Hey dog Come here

Clyde claps his hands and whistles The horses nearby in the
front yard stomp their feet anxiously making noises In the
cornfield something rustles and moves the stalks William
and Clyde turn towards this sound

WILLIAM
There he is

CLYDE
Dog Come on boy

The rustling sound does not come again A light breeze gently
stirs the corn stalks around them

( )

CLYDE (CONT’D)
Maybe we should get some of that jerky
set it out for him He’1ll come back when
he wants to I reckon

WILLIAM
Setting out jerky will probably just get
us possums

CLYDE
Yeah

William kicks at the ground

WILLIAM
Well do it anyway Just in case

CLYDE
Yeah

Clyde and William head back towards the house Todd and
Joseph are in the doorway watching

TODD
He’s not out there

WILLIAM
He took off He’ll be back He’s run off
like this before

TODD
Never like the hounds of hell were after
him

CLYDE

That was damn weird wasn’t it

WILLIAM
He’s a dog Dogs are weird

They walk inside
INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

William looks at Sam who is still seated Sam is playing
with the gold coins

queasy I must have lost more blood than
I thought

WILLIAM
You still want first watch

SAM
Yeah I might pass out but I won’t be
falling asleep
(pause)
Just kidding

In the distance thunder rumbles They look up at the sound

TODD
That’s just great

WILLIAM
Hey it ain’t bad A good storm could get
rid of any tracks we might have left

SAM
But if the ground gets muddy we could
leave tracks that’ll last for days

William smiles at Sam

WILLIAM
Hey Sam Cheer up

Thunder rumbles again

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Yeah Anyway who’s going out to the
barn

ANNABELLE
I will

CLYDE
Sure

EXT BARN -— EVENING

Joseph Clyde William and Annabelle step out of the back

door of the house facing the large barn A stone well and an

outhouse are positioned near the side of the house Between
the house and the barn two empty clotheslines hang between

oak trees

swaying in the wind

( )

ANNABELLE
Ill be just a second

Annabelle walks towards the outhouse William Clyde and
Joseph walk over to the barn

The large double doors to the barn stand open it is dark
within Clyde walks inside the barn holding his lantern
high William and Joseph follow

INT BARN - EVENING

The barn is large with a loft The lanterns William Clyde
and Joseph hold illuminate the tall walls Beneath the loft
are three rooms divided by wooden walls These rooms each
contain thin mattresses on the floor

JOSEPH
What’s that

CLYDE
Slave quarters

Clyde looks up at the roof of the barn

CLYDE (CONT’D)
The roof looks tight I wouldn’t want to
sleep in the hay up there though Who
knows what’s up there

WILLIAM
Let’s find out

William walks over to a tall ladder that leads up to the
loft Holding his lantern with one hand he begins scaling
the ladder

CLYDE
Careful up there

WILLIAM
Yeah

About halfway to the loft the rung under William’s feet
breaks with a dry snap William grabs onto another rung with
his free hand but it is also rotten and comes off in his
hand

William falls to the ground about six feet landing on his

back His lantern hits the ground next to him shattering and
spilling flaming oil onto the ground William rolls away

( )

CLYDE
Shit

Clyde begins attempting to kick dirt onto the flaming pool of
oil to no avail

JOSEPH
Hold on

Joseph runs away as William sits up coughing A moment
later Joseph runs into the barn again carrying a bucket of
water He throws the water onto the fire dousing it

William rises to his feet brushing himself off

WILLIAM
Damn

CLYDE
You alright

WILLIAM
Yeah Well forget that Whatever’s up
there isn’t getting down anyway
Goddamnit

William kicks the ladder breaking another rung Behind him
Joseph wanders off towards a corner of the barn

Lightning flashes filling the barn with pale light abruptly
casting strange shadows across the barn The large shadow of
a figure looms over the shadows of William and Clyde

They jump and whirl around to face Annabelle Clyde grabs at
his chest

ANNABELLE
What

CLYDE
Hell This place is turning me into a
little girl

WILLIAM
Let’s go back inside

ANNABELLE
We should put the horses in here Before
the storm really spooks them

WILLIAM
Yeah

( )

William moves ahead of them towards the house Annabelle
looks at Clyde

ANNABELLE
What happened

CLYDE
William broke the ladder

Over in the corner Joseph is kicking at a pile of straw He
bends down and extracts an object from the straw

JOSEPH
Hey

William looks over at Joseph who holds the object out It is
a worn damaged book which appears to be bound in dark
leather

JOSEPH (CONT’D)
I thought I saw something in there It
looks like a bible

Joseph flips through the book then shuts it Joseph hands
the book to William then examines one of his fingers and
begins sucking on it

JOSEPH (CONT’D)
Damn

WILLIAM
What

JOSEPH
Paper cut
(indicates the book)
What’s it say
William flips through the pages of the book There are no
images just page after page of indecipherable writing in
dark ink The writing appears to be Arabic

WILLIAM
I don’t know

Joseph looks at William suspiciously William holds the book
up pages out

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
It’s not in English Joseph

ANNABELLE
Let me see that

( )

William hands the book to her Annabelle flips through it
frowning

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
Weird Is this a code

WILLIAM
How should I know

TODD
I wonder who left it here

WILLIAM
Come on let’s get out of here before
that storm comes any closer You can play
with the book inside

rope which hangs over a bar above the well

INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

Todd and Sam are both drinking from the bottle of whiskey and
counting gold pieces at the table Clyde nods at them as he
William Annabelle and Joseph walk into the room from the

it

He leans towards her and they kiss again longer

WILLIAM
Sounds good

William and Annabelle surreptitiously exit the hallway
INT MAIN BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Annabelle and William are entangled on a large bed making
love by the light of a candle mounted on a thick wooden
dresser Annabelle is on top of William The flickering
candle flame casts strange shadows over her face

INT HOUSE FRONT ROOM - EVENING

Joseph throws down his cards and stretches Sam Clyde and
Todd continue covertly staring at their cards Sam is
sweating and pale

JOSEPH
That’s it I’m out

TODD
Wise decision Wiser than our friends
here who are going to lose their share
before they even get to count it

Clyde chuckles

CLYDE
Youd be better at bluffing Todd if
youd play it down a little I’1ll see
you and I’ll raise you five more

Todd whistles slowly shaking his head Sam frowns Outside
lightning flashes illuminating the horses One of the horses
rears up with a snort

JOSEPH
Aw hell I should get those horses into
the barn before this storm gets any
closer

( )

Joseph rises to his feet Clyde looks up at him

CLYDE

outside

The horses seem somewhat calmer in the barn One of them
leans down to chew on some hay
JOSEPH

There you go I’1l go and get you some

water how’s that
Joseph pats one of the horses and exits the barn
EXT WELL - EVENING
Joseph walks up to the well holding onto the bucket and rope
with one hand At the bottom of the well a slight splashing
sound is audible followed immediately by a small voice that

of a childs

YOUNG BOY (0S)
Please Please help me

Joseph freezes then leans over to look into the well still
holding the bucket The well is completely dark nothing is
visible inside

JOSEPH
Hello

The voice comes again as if from the bottom of the well
YOUNG BOY (0S)

Please help me Help me out of here

( )

JOSEPH
(confused)
Are you in the water down there

YOUNG BOY (0S)
Yes Help me

JOSEPH
Are you okay

YOUNG BOY (0S)
Please help me My daddy threw me in
here mister The water’s too deep

JOSEPH
(to himself)
My god

Joseph looks around as if looking for help then calls down
into the well

JOSEPH (CONT’D)
Hang on just a second kid I’m lowering
a bucket down okay

No sound comes from the bottom of the well

JOSEPH (CONT’D)
Okay

YOUNG BOY (0S)
Please hurry It’s cold

Joseph quickly begins lowering the bucket

JOSEPH
Okay Don’t worry I’11l pull you up out
of there in just a moment
(to himself angry)
Then we’ll talk about what the hell’s
going on here

The rope goes slack in Joseph’s hands
JOSEPH (CONT’D)
Can you see the bucket It’s down there
(pause)
Have you got it

The rope is pulled taut again Joseph grips it with one hand

YOUNG BOY (0S)
Yes I’ve got it

( )
44

JOSEPH
Okay Now just hold on to that bucket
alright

Joseph begins pulling the bucket up dragging up the rope
hand over hand The child clearly weighs more than Joseph
expected and he grits his teeth as he pulls

JOSEPH (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Jesus

Joseph begins dragging the bucket back up straining against
the rope

JOSEPH (CONT’D)
(calling out)
How are you doing

There is no response from the well Joseph continues pulling
the bucket up

JOSEPH (CONT’D)
Almost there

Joseph reaches forward into the darkness of the well to take
hold of the rope and a child’s small hand reaches out from
the darkness grabbing onto Joseph’s wrist Joseph’s eyes
widen in surprise

Quickly Joseph is yanked off his feet down into the well
The bucket moves with him the rope twisting after it There
is a large splashing sound then silence from within the
well

The wind tosses the grass around the well Lightning flashes
INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

Clyde reacts to the lightning looking around Sam and Todd
are still playing cards

CLYDE
I wonder what’s taking Joseph

Todd shrugs then looks at Sam curiously

TODD
Hey Sam you okay there

Sam is rubbing at his collarbone

( )

SAM

itching

TODD
That means it’s healing

SAM

Todd looks up The three exchange glances

EXT BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

up at this

TODD
I’11 check the barn

INT MAIN BEDROOM — MOMENTS LATER

William and Annabelle lie in bed together naked under the
covers Annabelle is asleep in William’s arms

A slight creaking sound comes from outside the bedroom
followed by a soft knock on the door William opens one eye

The soft knocking comes again followed by a whisper

SAM (0S)
Hey William

William grimaces then carefully extricates himself from

Annabelle’s arms Annabelle moans in her sleep and rolls

over William quickly slips his pants on and walks to the
bedroom door

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

William exits the bedroom shutting the door behind him
Immediately the sound of a latch turning and locking is
heard William heads off down the hallway

EXT FRONT YARD - EVENING

William and Sam walk off the porch into the front yard Sam
gestures to the rear of the house

SAM
Clyde and Todd are back there

William walks off quickly towards the rear of the house Sam
stands in the front yard for a moment He rubs softly at his
shoulder wincing The fabric of Sam’s shirt is dark and wet
in a small circle just over his bandage

( )

Something falls to the ground directly in front of Sam
hitting the ground hard Sam looks up at the empty sky above
him then holds out his lantern and steps forward

A medium-sized bird is curled up in the grass having just
fallen from the sky The bird’s eyes are closed and it is not
moving Sam looks at the bird then looks back up at the sky
Lightning flashes followed immediately by thunder

A dog’s bark comes from the cornfield nearby Sam jumps and
turns to face the sound

SAM (CONTD)
Dog

Sam steps forward then stops slowly moving his arm
wiggling his fingers

SAM (CONT’D)
Ow Damn

Sam walks through the yard and steps into the cornfield
lightly moving in between the haphazard rows making his way
through the stalks Sam is following the trail the six of
them made with their horses when they first moved through the
field trampling down a wide path of corn Sam moves towards
the path alert

Sam’s lantern is not doing much good in the field
illuminating only the stalks around him all of which are
near enough to touch

Sam stops and slaps his leg

SAM (CONTD)
Dog Come’ere boy

Sam continues making his way through the cornfield looking
around He whistles for Dog clapping his hands A moment
later Dog’s bark comes again further ahead in the
cornfield to Sam’s right

SAM (CONTD)
Come on boy What the hell are you doing
out here

Sam pushes his way through the cornstalks to his side moving
more quickly now sweating Dog barks again again Sam heads
towards the noise pushing through the stalks

SAM (CONTD)
Dog Hold up there

( )

Suddenly Sam stumbles into a clearing

Briefly disoriented Sam raises his lantern Directly in
front of him is the wooden cross where the scarecrow was
hung Strands of barbed wire are still attached to the cross
but the scarecrow is gone

Sam backs away then looks around

SAM (CONTD)
(to himself)
Where the hell

The cornfield is still except for the wind lightly moving
the stalks

SAM (CONTD)
Dog

There is no response Sam slowly begins backing away from the
cross then turns and moves back into the cornfield

EXT BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

William Todd and Clyde are standing near the well looking
dejected as Sam quickly walks up to them still covered with
a thin sheen of sweat

WILLIAM
Well could he have just wandered off for
a little while Maybe he’s pulling a joke
or something

TODD
I sure hope so I’d hate to think of
anything that could take Joseph without
making enough noise for us to hear

Clyde cups his hands and shouts into the wind

CLYDE
Joseph

There is no response After a moment William shrugs and the
four men walk back towards the house

WILLIAM
I think we’d better each hold onto our
guns from now on though particularly if
we go out alone

SAM
I’m way ahead of you there

( )

WILLIAM
Where’ve you been

SAM

I think Nevermind

(shakes head)
I heard Dog in the cornfield and I went
after him I guess I got a little lost
turned out I wasn’t headed in the
direction I thought I was Got turned
around

WILLIAM
Youre lucky you made it out of there
You can’t see where you’re going in that
field in the daytime much less at night
with a storm coming Whoever tended that
field’s long gone

Clyde falls back a little from the group as they walk through
the yard

CLYDE
I gotta take care of something I’1l be
around in a minute

Clyde walks towards the outhouse

INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

William Sam and Todd sit in the living room William throws
a knife at the wall the knife plunges into the wood William
rises to his feet crosses over to the knife and takes it out
of the wall He then walks back to his chair and throws his
knife at the wall again

SAM
You should get some sleep

WILLIAM
Not likely

Todd picks up a handful of gold coins and begins stacking
them

INT MAIN BEDROOM —- EVENING

Annabelle lies in bed breathing softly In the bedroom the
closet door slowly creaks open

Annabelle opens her eyes the room is silent Annabelle

frowns then blinks and shuts her eyes again The sound of
quick footsteps moving across the room is heard

( )

Annabelle opens her eyes wide and sits up in bed looking
around the dark room Her hand goes over to her pistol on the
pillow next to her Annabelle lifts the pistol and pulls back
the hammer Seeing nothing in the room Annabelle shifts
slightly still craning her head around She then leans back
and blows her hair out of her face

ANNABELLE
(to herself)
Youre dreaming honey

Annabelle stretches then looks around the room again
Sighing she climbs out of bed and cautiously crosses over to
the closet Annabelle gingerly pushes some clothes out of the
way and looks inside the closet contains only clothes

INT OUTHOUSE - EVENING

Clyde sits in the outhouse looking straight ahead
passively He is chewing on a piece of hay

Just outside of the outhouse a rustling sound is audible
like something moving through the tall grass Clyde
straightens reaching down for his shotgun

The rustling sound comes closer to the outhouse Then a
sniffing noise like that of an animal comes near the bottom
of the outhouse door Clyde relaxes slightly though he is
still tense He lowers the shotgun

CLYDE
Hey Dog

The sniffing at the bottom of the door stops There is
silence for a moment then the sound of claws raking against
the bottom of the door Clyde jerks back

The clawing sound continues with a quiet animalistic
grunting noise Clyde stands hitching up his pants and
points the shotgun at the door

CLYDE (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Fucking hell

Clyde moves to the door as the clawing continues and ina
swift movement throws the door open and lowers the shotgun
There is nothing outside of the door Clyde steps quickly out
of the outhouse and looks around no creature is in sight

CLYDE (CONT’D)
Dog

( )

Clyde stands for a moment looking confused
INT MAIN BEDROOM - EVENING

Annabelle shuts the closet door then turns around and
surveys the room She looks at the bed After a moment
Annabelle crosses over to the bed kneels down on the floor
and peers under the bed

Under the bed in the opposite corner something large is
just visible in the shadows Annabelle cannot make out its
features it could be crouching animal or a pile of
clothing Very slowly Annabelle reaches for the lantern next
to the bed and holds the lantern out at floor level

Illuminated under the opposite corner of the bed is a small
boy crouched in a fetal position silently rocking back and
forth Annabelle frowns peering closer Just then the boy
lifts his head up and looks straight at her his face dark

Moving with unnatural speed under the bed the boy crawls
towards Annabelle scuttling like a crab He is immediately
face to face with her

The boy grins at Annabelle in the light of the lantern he is
toothless and his eyes are completely black with no irises

Annabelle screams and falls back away from the boy knocking
over the lantern It goes out plunging the room into
complete darkness

INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

Annabelle’s scream is audible from upstairs William Sam and
Todd react then run out of the room for the stairs William
in the lead

INT MAIN BEDROOM - EVENING

Annabelle is standing in the corner of the room facing the
open bedroom door William runs into the doorway Todd and

Sam coming up behind him

WILLIAM
What What is it

ANNABELLE
There was a boy in here

WILLIAM
Where is he

( )

ANNABELLE
He ran out

Annabelle points towards them in the doorway William looks
at Sam and Todd who look at each other and head for the
opposite rooms

William crosses over to Annabelle He puts an arm around her

WILLIAM
You alright honey
ANNABELLE
Yeah I’m fine He just scared me

The lighting or something

WILLIAM
This a young kid

ANNABELLE
I don’t know He couldn’t be too old He
was small His face

WILLIAM
Well they’11l find him in a second

Todd and Sam appear in the doorway again Todd shakes his
head

WILLIAM (CONT’D)

What

TODD
We’re the only ones on this floor He’s
not here

William stares at him

WILLIAM
Well could he have gone out of a window

Todd shrugs Sam walks into the bedroom looking sick and
sits down heavily on the bed

SAM
He couldn’t have gone downstairs we
would’ve passed him

TODD
I don’t know A lot of these big houses
have passageways

William and Annabelle both look around the walls nervously

( )

WILLIAM
I sure hate the thought of that We
should start checking around see if any
of these walls are hollow

Annabelle is watching Sam

ANNABELLE
You okay Sam

SAM
Yeah I’m just feeling a little tired

ANNABELLE
You should lie down and get some rest I
know I’m not going to be sleeping for
awhile

WILLIAM
Yeah well we’ll see about that One way
or another we’re moving on at first
light tomorrow and we all need to get
some sleep before then Sam you go
ahead well wake you if anything comes

up
Sam nods and stiffly lies back on the bed

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
(to others)
Let’s go

They exit the room Todd in the lead Sam lying on the bed
unbuttons his shirt and pushes it open He pulls back the
bandage to look at his wound The area around where the
bullet entered is red and swollen and the skin around it is
purple and glossy

Sam touches his chest near the wound and flinches He lies
back in the bed and closes his eyes sweating

EXT FRONT YARD —- EVENING

William Annabelle and Todd walk out onto the front porch
The wind tears at the branches of a tree in front of them

TODD
This is turning out to be a hell of a
night

WILLIAM
No kidding

( )

William steps off the porch then bends down picks up a rock
and throws it into the field

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Christ

A drop of rain falls and hits William’s forehead He looks up
at the sky as more raindrops plunk onto the ground around
him

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
That’s great

William turns back to look at Annabelle and Todd who are
still on the porch protected from the rain

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
I’m gonna look around a little

ANNABELLE
Ill go with you

TODD
Yeah I might look around myself

WILLIAM
No somebody should stay up in the front
room in case anyone comes back or tries
to get into the house
(pause)
Speaking of which where’s Clyde

ANNABELLE
Oh god

TODD
He was going to the outhouse

WILLIAM

You’d think he’d be done by now Stay
here

William and Annabelle walk around to the side of the house
as Todd steps back into the front room

INT SIDE YARD - EVENING
It is raining harder as William and Annabelle walk back
towards the barn The rain splatters off William’s hat and

has soaked Annabelle’s hair and dress

ANNABELLE
William

( )

William stops and looks at her

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
It’s just
(pause)
There’s something wrong here I know it
We should leave

William looks up into the rain

WILLIAM
Not much chance of that now Besides we
can’t just leave Joseph here He could
have just gone for a walk

ANNABELLE
He didn’t just go for a walk William

William looks somewhat taken aback by the panic in
Annabelle’s voice He reaches out hesitantly and touches her

arm

He trails

Annabelle

WILLIAM
You okay
ANNABELLE
I’m I’m sorry But I mean You feel

it don’t you

WILLIAM
Uh I can’t say that I do Not really I
mean weird stuff’s been going on and
maybe someone’s messing with us but

off as Annabelle shakes her head

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
What

shakes her head again

ANNABELLE
Nothing I don’t know

WILLIAM
Come here

Annabelle moves closer to him and he embraces her They hold
each other in the pouring rain then William moves away from

Annabelle

smiling at her

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Now look

( )

Annabelle looks over William’s left shoulder her eyes
widening William whirls around

Clyde is standing behind him scowling The light of Clyde’s
lantern is subdued by the rain

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Clyde Good god man We were worried
youd fallen in

CLYDE
Yeah Did you guys see Joseph come by
here

WILLIAM

Well no we didn’t
Clyde squints into the nearby cornfield

CLYDE
I couldve sworn I saw him moving around
in there

Annabelle and William look at each other

WILLIAM
Are you sure it was him I mean I can
barely see the stalks

CLYDE
Yeah I saw a head and shoulders moving
around in the rows but then

WILLIAM
Then what
CLYDE
Well then I didn’t see him anymore
(pause)
It was either him or something else real
big

There is a short silence while they consider this

WILLIAM
Well I don’t think they have bears down
here so it was probably Joseph I bet
he’s playing some sort of game

CLYDE
Yeah I might have had a run-in with Dog
earlier too

(MORE)

( ) CLYDE (CONTD)

It could have just been a raccoon I
guess Whatever it was it ran off before
I could get my hands on it

WILLIAM
That’s good news I was worried Dog
might’ve spooked off for good

William looks at Annabelle smiling optimistically Annabelle
returns a faint smile

INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

Todd sits at the table in front of several stacks of gold
coins Todd drinks from a bottle of whiskey

A sudden noise comes from the hallway nearby Todd starts
then looks into the hallway seeing nothing

INT MAIN BEDROOM —- EVENING

Sam lies in bed sweating looking up at the ceiling He
looks down at the foot of his bed

As Sam watches the older boy child the same one that
Annabelle saw slowly rises up from the foot of the bed and
looks at Sam putting his hands on the mattress The boy’s
eyes and mouth are dark holes

Sam stares at the boy frozen with fear The older boy
addresses Sam calmly

OLDER BOY
My parents used to lie together in this
bed This is where my mother was when the
consumption took her

The boy looks down at the floor then crouches down beneath
the bed disappearing from Sam’s view Sam squeezes his eyes
shut pulling the blankets up around his neck

Sam begins quickly muttering to himself an incoherent litany
of barely audible prayers

SAM
Our father who art in heaven hallowed be
thy name Yea though I walk through

the valley of the shadow of death I
shall fear no evil for thou art with me
Thy kingdom come thy will be done Amen

When Sam opens his eyes a large man is standing in the
corner of the room barely visible in the darkness

( )

The man is holding a long object obscured by the shadows in
one hand The FATHER speaks possibly to himself

FATHER
I had to do it If I hadn’t done it it
would have been so much worse for them I
put them where they’1l never be found by
anyone You understand don’t you

The man steps forwards slightly The object in his hand is a
small bloody scythe The man’s head is lowered

FATHER (CONT’D)
Tell me you understand

Sam trembling with fright tries to speak

SAM
Sure Sure I understand

The man stops Then he slowly turns and looks at Sam

FATHER
Who are you Where is she

Sam shuts his eyes again and begins muttering inarticulately
to himself The room is silent Sam slowly opens his eyes

The man is standing above Sam leaning over the bed The man
raises his scythe above his head

FATHER (CONT’D)
I asked you a question

Sam screams
EXT FRONT YARD - EVENING

William Clyde and Annabelle walk through the rain up to the
front porch

CLYDE
Well what now

WILLIAM
I wouldn’t mind getting some rest Anyone
else for that

Annabelle laughs drily

ANNABELLE
You can count me out

( )

WILLIAM
Well sit up with Todd then I’1l sit
with you guys for a second then I’m
going to get some shut-eye

CLYDE
I guess I could use it

They walk into the house
INT FRONT ROOM - EVENING

William Annabelle and Clyde step into the front room
looking around The gold is still piled on the table Todd
steps out from the kitchen holding his lantern

WILLIAM
What’re you up to

TODD
Thought I heard a noise back here near
the basement door Guess I was wrong
Anything happening

WILLIAM
Not that I can see Clyde here says he
saw Joseph and Dog

CLYDE
Or at least it was some kind of animal

TODD
You should’ve shot it Then at least wed
have something fresh to eat
William sits down on the floor heavily and begins rolling a
cigarette Annabelle sits down next to William She reaches
for the book flips through it then sets it back down on the
table She then lightly rests her head on William’s shoulder

ANNABELLE
Roll me one

WILLIAM
Sure thing

Clyde sits down at the table with Todd who shifts the deck
of cards over towards him Clyde begins shuffling

INT FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING

Clyde throws down five cards disgusted

( )

CLYDE
I swear you’re cheating

Todd lifts a finger to his lips tilting his head over
towards William and Annabelle who are fast asleep on the
floor Annabelle is curled up next to William who is still
sitting against the wall his mouth slightly open breathing
deeply

TODD
Shhh You’1l wake the dead with your
pernicious lies

Clyde grins at William and Annabelle

CLYDE
Aw ain’t they sweet

Clyde yawns and arches his back

CLYDE (CONT’D)
I’m getting a little weary myself

TODD
Sure you are Or maybe you don’t want to
lose any more gold

CLYDE
Ah you’re just scared to stand watch
alone

TODD
Nonsense

CLYDE

You gonna let me get some sleep then
TODD

Sure I think you could use it You’re

getting grouchy

Clyde looks at Todd askance then rises from the table and
begins moving towards the stairs

TODD (CONTD)
Youre sleeping upstairs

CLYDE
They got beds there don’t they

TODD
I guess

( )

Clyde shrugs and climbs the stairs Todd puts down his cards
and looks out into the rain

INT CHILD’S BEDROOM - LATE EVENING

Clyde walks into the dark bedroom He walks over to one of
the beds leans down and knocks a doll off of it The doll
hits the ground and rolls over onto its back staring up at
the ceiling with painted eyes Clyde scowls at it then sets
his lantern down next to the bed

Clyde lies down on the bed which he is slightly too large
for and pulls an old torn blanket up over the lower half of
his body He then bends down and turns the lantern down low
Clyde curls up and shuts his eyes

INT FRONT ROOM - LATE EVENING

Todd flips a gold coin languidly across the fingers of one
hand looking slowly around the room He yawns then pulls
out his gun and begins cleaning it

INT FRONT ROOM —- NIGHT

William and Annabelle are still asleep in the same
positions At the table Todd’s head is resting on one hand
his arm propped up on the table The lantern next to him has
been turned down low

Todd blinks very slowly His eyelids close then he opens
his eyes wide looking around quickly Nothing in the room is
different

Todd’s eyes slowly start to shut again He blinks twice then
his eyelids close

A thumping noise comes from beyond the kitchen Todd’s eyes
fly open and he sits up straight looking towards the
kitchen

Todd swiftly surveys the room then slumps back in his chair
rubbing at his face

The noise comes again from somewhere on the other side of
the house and Todd jumps to his feet his eyes narrowed

Todd looks down at William and Annabelle who are still
asleep He then walks past them into the kitchen

INT FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR —- NIGHT

Todd walks through the dark kitchen holding his lantern in
one hand his gun in the other He walks into the corridor
stopping near the door to the basement

Todd looks around The windows facing outside are dark
though the sound of the rainstorm can still be heard The
wind whistles and rain splatters against the glass
windowpanes

Todd turns around and faces the door to the basement He puts
the handle to his lantern between his teeth reaches down and
grips the doorknob Slowly Todd turns the doorknob

Todd pushes on the door It does not budge He leans against
the door still holding onto the doorknob but the door will
not move

Todd sighs and releases the doorknob He steps across the
corridor to one of the windows Todd raises his lantern but
only illuminates the water against the glass

Todd moves his face closer to the glass but cannot see
anything in the darkness outside all he can see is his
reflection in the window Todd stares at his reflection
brushing slightly at his hair

Just then lightning flashes illuminating the outside world
Sam is facing the other side of the window looking in at
Todd from the outside Todd jumps back with a yell as the
sound of thunder cracks against the house

On the outside of the house Sam’s face is directly in front
of Todd’s looking straight into Todd’s eyes twisted into a
mask of hate They are separated only by the pane of glass
Sams hair is matted and his clothes are drenched by the
rain

Sam runs to the side then the outside world goes dark again
as the lightning ends Todd fumbles with his lantern turning
it up higher and holds it to the window He can see nothing
outside

Todd pants catching his breath He moves over to another
window calling out

TODD
Sam

There is no response

( )

TODD (CONTD)
(to himself)
What the hell
(shouting)
What the hell are you doing out there

Only the sound of the rain can be heard Thunder rumbles
slightly far off

TODD (CONTD)
(to himself)
What the hell is he doing

Todd walks back towards the kitchen Just as he passes the
door to the basement a loud thumping sound comes from
against the other side of the basement door as if a person
were throwing their body against it There is a stifled
whimper like a person in pain from the other side of the
door then silence

Todd jumps back staring at the basement door his eyes wild
The sound does not come again Todd looks around

TODD (CONT’D)
Sam

Todd moves slowly towards the basement door Holding his gun
out with his lantern between his teeth he again turns the
doorknob and shoves

The door to the basement swings open Todd steps away from
the door raising his gun Nothing but darkness is visible

TODD (CONTD)
Alright Come on out now

There is no sound from the basement Todd steps forward and
pushes the door open further with his foot He holds his
lantern forward

The basement steps are visible but there is no one on them
Todd sticks his head into the doorway looking around

After a moment he begins walking down the stairs slowly
The wooden steps creak as Todd moves down them

INT CHILD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Clyde lies still in the small bed quietly breathing From
across the room the sound of a female child softly sobbing

can be heard Clyde frowns in his sleep shakes his head
slightly then opens his eyes confused

( )

The sound of the child crying is coming from the corner of
the room which is not visible Clyde frowns and looks
around blinking He sits up in bed rubbing his eyes

Clyde cannot see anything in the dark room Carefully
without making a sound he reaches down and turns up the
lantern next to the bed

The older boy is standing immediately in front of Clyde next
to the lantern The boy’s eyes are completely black and his
face is expressionless Before Clyde can react the boy looks
away from him and steps back into the darkness of the room
disappearing from sight The crying sound continues

CLYDE
What- Who’s there

Clyde rapidly turns the lantern up all the way illuminating
most of the bedroom His hand is unsteady and the lantern
light sways as he sets the lantern back on the floor

The boy is nowhere to be seen In the corner of the bedroom
a small girl is crouched her arms around her knees facing
the corner The girl is wearing only a pair of underwear Her
back which is facing Clyde trembles with her sobs

Clyde rubs his eyes looks around again then looks at the
girl

CLYDE (CONTD)
Hey how’d you get in here Where’d that
other kid go

The girl does not respond continuing to face the corner and
cry Clyde rises to his feet standing next to the bed

CLYDE (CONT’D)
Look here are you okay What’s the
matter

The girl does not respond Clyde moves closer to her walking
over to the corner

CLYDE (CONT’D)
It’s okay don’t cry Tell me what’s
wrong Did that kid do something bad to
you You just tell me who did it and
I’1l take care of him okay Did
something happen

The girl suddenly stands and whirls to face Clyde who is now

only a couple of feet away from her The girl’s ears are
slightly pointed and her nose is unnaturally flat

( )

she has vertical pupils like a cat and her teeth are also
inhuman long and thin There is a large deep gash across
the front of the girl’s neck her throat has been ripped
away The front of the girl’s body is soaked red with blood

YOUNG GIRL
(screams )
My father did this

Clyde leaps backwards stumbling and falls onto the floor
bumping his head He jolts into a seated position scooting
desperately across the floor away from the corner The
corner is empty The girl is gone

Clyde stops seeing this and sits on the floor leaning back
against the bed breathing heavily He looks quickly around
the room reaching for his gun

CLYDE
What the fucking hell

A shout comes from outside of the house

JOSEPH (0S)
Hey Clyde

Clyde looks up at the sound of Joseph’s voice He rises to
his feet and rapidly crosses over to the window Lightning
flashes

Outside just next to the cornfield Joseph is standing
looking up at Clyde’s window He is crouched over hunched
like an animal Joseph looks up at Clyde over his shoulder
out of the corners of his eyes The lightning subsides and
the yard goes dark again

Clyde lifts up the window sash looking outside

CLYDE
(shouting)
Joseph

Lightning flashes again Joseph is visible in the cornfield
about ten feet from where the field meets the yard making
his way deeper into the cornfield still hunched over
unnaturally Joseph is leaving a path of broken and smashed
cornstalks behind him

CLYDE (CONT’D)
Joseph

Joseph does not look back Clyde pauses then turns and runs
out of the bedroom

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Todd reaches the bottom of the basement stairs sweating He
murmurs to himself softly

TODD
I know you’re in here

The floor of the cellar is earth the walls of the cellar are
comprised of damp stone Todd holds both the lantern and gun
out in front of his body turning around surveying the
basement which is too dark to see across Todd begins to
move past the staircase keeping his back to the wall

In the center of the room on the cracked earthen floor a
precise pentagram approximately five feet in diameter has
been drawn in yellow paint or chalk Inexplicable symbols
surround the pentagram

Four posts have been driven into the floor along the
circumference of the pentagram forming a square Above the
pentagram lines of rope have been hung from floorboards as
if for drying food

Todd glances at this then slowly moves to the other side of
the stairwell still carefully keeping his back to the wall
On the other side of the basement the space is equally bare
Todd moves closer looking around

Against the stone wall a set of iron shackles with cuffs
has been nailed into the stone Todd frowns at this then
turns away

The only other object in the room is a short squat wooden
chair Todd moves closer to the chair shining his lantern on
it The chair has thick leather straps bound to its arms and
the two front chair legs

Next to the chair on the floor is a piece of hide rolled
into a tube Todd kicks lightly at the hide unrolling it
The hide contains several metal tools all in various states
of decay and rust Many of the tools are sharp and pointed
Some are recognizable such as a pair of pliers and a ball-
peen hammer while others are not

Next to the chair on the ground lies a small white object
Todd glances back at the chair then kneels down and picks up
the object It appears to be a broken piece of bone or tooth
Todd drops it disgusted

Todd quickly backs away from the chair still peering around

the room heading back towards the stairwell A sharp voice
suddenly comes from the other side of the cellar

( )

BLACK WOMAN (0S)
Help me

Todd jumps and spins around On the floor in the center of
the pentagram a black woman is lying Her wrists and ankles
are bound to the four posts She looks over at Todd
straining her head to see him tears in her eyes

BLACK WOMAN (CONT’D)
Help me Oh god please

The woman is wearing only a short sloppy dress made out of
thick muslin it barely covers her torso Todd looks around
the room quickly There is no one around except the two of
them

TODD
Who did this to you How the hell did you
get there

BLACK WOMAN
Oh god please help me Please let me go
I didn’t do anything I’1ll never tell
anyone about the others

Todd steps closer to the woman frowning She shrinks away
from him constricted by her ropes

TODD
What’s going on here

BLACK WOMAN
(shaking her head wildly)
I didn’t see nothing I didn’t see
nothing

Todd starts to say something stops then walks over to the
woman and kneels down next to her He begins trying to untie
her hand from one of the posts but seems to be having a
difficult time with it Suddenly Todd stops and stares

TODD
Shit You’re bound with dried rawhide

The woman’s hands are indeed swollen and purple The rawhide
is cutting into the flesh of her wrists

BLACK WOMAN

(whimpering)
It hurts

( )

TODD
(grim)
I know it
(he stares at her)
How long have you been down here

BLACK WOMAN
(whispering)
Please hurry

The black woman’s eyes dart around the room looking for
something

TODD
Okay I’m going to go to the other side
of the stairwell and get something to try
to cut this with

Todd trails off as the woman has focused her eyes on
something across the room from them Her face is frozen in
terror her mouth open

BLACK WOMAN
He’s here

Todd looks where she is looking There is nothing there

TODD
I don’t see anything

The woman ignores him She is breathing quickly her eyes
still riveted on a spot about a yard in front of her legs
There is still nothing visible there

BLACK WOMAN
(whispering)
Please No

Todd looks around the room his eyes narrowed He rises to
his feet

The woman is paralyzed with fear tears run out of the
corners of her eyes She is now ignoring Todd completely
focusing her attention on the area opposite from them She
shakes her head back and forth but is quiet

Todd watches this then quickly grabs his lantern and gun and
heads for the opposite side of the room leaving the woman on
the floor

On the other side of the cellar Todd reaches the chair and
kneels down next to it

( )

Suddenly Todd freezes Very slowly he looks up at the chair
in front of him It is empty Todd shivers then shakes his
head and begins rooting through the rusted tools

Todd comes across a serrated thin blade with a curved
handle He grabs this and a pair of shears Todd stands and
walks over towards the stairwell holding out his lantern

Todd stops as soon as he enters the other side of the
basement The woman is still there lying in the pentagram
but now her back is arched The front of her dress has been
cut open to expose her stomach and torso

The woman’s eyes lock onto Todd’s As Todd watches frozen a
thick cut appears on the side of the woman’s stomach The cut
continues across her belly moving just above the navel ina
curved line under her ribs

The woman’s mouth opens and her eyes squeeze shut It appears
that she is screaming in pain but the only audible sounds in
the room are Todd’s breathing and the sound of the woman’s
skin and flesh separating

Blood wells out of the long cut on the woman’s stomach
soaking into her dress and the dirt floor She shakes her
head wildly her mouth still stretched open

As Todd watches his eyes wide with horror the cut in the
woman’s stomach suddenly widens as if it is being pushed
open From the open wound the woman’s guts are roughly
pulled from her body straight into the air above her Her
entrails hover above her stomach dripping blood and fluid

The woman’s scream cuts through the air a loud awful shriek
of pain that tears through the quiet of the room

Blood splatters the floor as Todd turns and leaps away the
woman’s agonized screaming filling the basement Todd’s feet
hit the first step of the basement stairs and he stumbles
falling to his side on the other side of the basement

Todd hits the ground hard cracking his elbow against the
wall and dropping his gun and lantern The woman is still
screaming

Todd’s lantern lies on its side in front of him Todd reaches
for it looking forward towards the chair As Todd’s eyes
meet with something in front of him his face goes slack with
fear and he shrinks away screaming his back against the
wall

INT FRONT ROOM —- NIGHT

William and Annabelle are still asleep on the floor The
sound of footsteps running down the stairs comes from behind
them

William opens his eyes and looks around the room just as
Clyde runs through the front room Clyde grabs the front
doorknob opens it and runs outside into the storm

WILLIAM
What the hell

William rises up rousing Annabelle who looks up at him
blearily

ANNABELLE
What’s going on

WILLIAM
Clyde just ran through here I don’t know
what he’s after I’m gonna go check

ANNABELLE
Okay You do that

Annabelle immediately puts her head back down and closes her
eyes William looks troubled

WILLIAM
Well I don’t really want to leave you
alone in here

ANNABELLE
(mumbling)
Don’t worry about it I’1l be fine

WILLIAM
Well

William looks up suddenly Sam is standing in the darkness of
the hallway barely visible his eyes glowing with the
lantern light His clothing is drenched Sam stares at
William without speaking

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Sam Good thing you’re up Clyde just ran
through here faster than lightning

William rises to his feet rubbing the arm that he slept on
He looks around the room

( )

The gold is gone from the table only the cards whiskey
bottles and book rest on the table

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Holy shit The gold

William looks around the room again quickly The gold is
nowhere to be seen William looks back at Sam his teeth
bared

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Hang in here just a second watch over
Annabelle I’m going after Clyde I’1l be
right back

William turns away from Sam who has not changed expression
and runs out the front door shutting it behind him

Sam slowly steps out of the darkness of the hallway He looks
down at Annabelle his nostrils flaring slightly then walks

over to the table and lowers himself into a chair Sam sits

staring straight ahead

EXT FRONT YARD —- NIGHT

William runs out into the rain holding his lantern aloft
Clyde is nowhere to be seen but there is a spot in the rows
of corn near the yard where several stalks have been pushed
aside or trampled

William runs across the yard and into the cornfield The
broken stalks form a haphazard trail through the tall corn
though William can still only see a couple feet in front of
himself and cannot see over the corn

William continues staggering through the corn along the
trail holding his lantern in front of him William calls
out

WILLIAM
Clyde Hey Clyde

The sound of the rain splattering off the cornstalks drowns
out William’s voice

INT FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
Sam sits at the table He has the book in his hands and flips
through the pages pausing occasionally After a moment Sam

slowly looks down at Annabelle sleeping on the floor

SAM
Annabelle

( )

Annabelle stirs slightly on the floor

SAM (CONTD)
Annabelle

She opens her eyes and looks up at Sam squinting

ANNABELLE
Sam What are you doing

Sam does not respond for a moment turning his attention back
to the book

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
What is it What’s going on

SAM
I’m reading

Annabelle smiles at Sam then when he continues to look at
the pages of the book frowns puzzled

ANNABELLE
Youre reading that book

SAM
Yes

Annabelle straightens her back tilting her head to see Sam
better

ANNABELLE
What does it say

SAM
It’s about how to contact the Old Ones
ANNABELLE
Who
Sam’s face darkens
SAM

The Old Ones I said Most think of them
as spirits They can walk between worlds
and time is different for them When they
appear in our world they mostly show
themselves as animals unless they are
given greater power Because they walk
between worlds their physical power is
limited in each one They should not be
given mortal power the power to change
us unless they can be controlled

( )

Sam smiles down at Annabelle a haunted look in his eyes His
smile trembles

SAM (CONTD)
I just got to that part

Annabelle rubs her eyes and speaks slowly

ANNABELLE
Sam What are you talking about You’re
not making any sense Are you okay

Sam straightens up his face blank and sets down the book on
the table

SAM
The hole in my shoulder hurts I think
something might be wrong

Annabelle sits up on the floor stretching

ANNABELLE
Well you’d better let me take a look at
it Hang on

Annabelle unsteadily rises to her feet She steps forward and
takes a seat at the table opposite from Sam

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
Can you unbutton your shirt

Sam reaches up and begins slowly unbuttoning his shirt Once
he is finished he pushes his shirt open and tears off the
bandage

The area around Sam’s wound expanding to cover most of his
chest is a black swollen bruise Thin tendrils of purple
infection crawl up Sam’s neck and down his stomach The wound
itself is oozing a thick viscous fluid

Annabelle shrinks away holding her hand to her mouth

SAM
It doesn’t smell so good huh
ANNABELLE
My god How long has it been like this
Sam shrugs slightly
SAM

I don’t know

( )

ANNABELLE
Sam we’ve- We’ve got to get you to a
hospital You’ve got some sort of
infection I don’t have anything here
that can take care of it

Annabelle opens her bag and begins rooting through it

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
I might be able to give you something for
the pain

SAM
(smiles)
It doesn’t hurt anymore ‘Belle

Annabelle looks up at him

ANNABELLE
What What did you just say

Sam reaches forwards towards Annabelle

SAM
Here I want to show you something

ANNABELLE
What is it

Sam holds out his hand to Annabelle

SAM
Here

ANNABELLE
Sam I think you’re delirious Hang on
just a second and Ill give you a shot
that will make you feel a little better

SAM
Okay

Sam lowers his head looking down at the floor He then looks
up at Annabelle Sam’s green eyes are dark and his voice is
thick

SAM (CONTD)
Don’t you want to know what they did to

me

Annabelle takes a glass vial from her bag and begins drawing
fluid from the vial into a syringe

( )

ANNABELLE
You got shot Sam I was there remember

SAM
The preacher said shooting’s too good for
me
(Sam shows his teeth)
They just left me up there to rot for
what I did Them and the Old Ones They
left me here Forever

Annabelle taps the syringe

ANNABELLE
What are you talking about Sam

Sam leans forward suddenly and grips Annabelle’s arm His
eyes are pale

SAM
(hissing)
Stop calling me that

Annabelle gasps then blinks Her eyes roll up into her head
and her body goes rigid

BEGIN FLASHBACK
EXT CORNFIELD — DAY

From the Father’s POV the cornfield is upside-down and
swaying from side to side unevenly A thick trail of blood
runs from the Father’s nose into one of his eyes filling the
eye with blood The Father blinks rapidly He is being
dragged by his feet through the field

A group of men are dragging him through the neat cornfield
The Father now fully visible is the same man that Sam saw
up in the main bedroom The Father tries to twist away from
the men who drag him into a small clearing

The men release the Father’s legs he curls up on the ground
breathing heavily A large fly settles on a bloody spot on
the side of his face He swats at the fly

Another group of men stand in the clearing many of whom are
holding rifles They stare at the Father their faces twisted
with anger and disgust In front of the men stands a
PREACHER wearing the formal attire of the cloth

Behind the men is a tall wooden cross with a scarecrow

attached to it in a position to survey the cornfield The
preacher addresses the Father

( )

PREACHER
Where did you put the bodies

The Father is silent One of the men who was holding him
kicks the Father in the stomach The Father curls up on the
ground gagging

PREACHER (CONT’D)
Where are they And where are your
children

The Father coughs choking out his words

FATHER
Where they belong

The preacher leans closer to the Father staring into his
eyes

PREACHER
What happened to their mother

The Father looks away from him then looks back into the
preacher’s eyes

FATHER
They had no mother Not that you’d know

A look of confusion passes over the preacher’s face Then he
looks up and nods to one of the men

The man leans down with a burlap sack pulling it over the
Father’s head The Father struggles

FATHER (CONTD)
No Goddamn you What are you doing

One of the men holding a rifle quickly steps forward
aiming his rifle at the father

HYSTERICAL MAN
Shut that sick bastard up

The preacher quickly reaches over and puts his hand on the
barrel of the hysterical man’s rifle aiming it away from the
Father

PREACHER
Shooting’s too good for him

The man looks at the preacher The preacher nods over to the
rest of the men

( )

PREACHER (CONT’D)
Cut that scarecrow down

One of the men looks over at the preacher then jumps up on
the cross with a knife and cuts the ropes binding the
scarecrow The scarecrow tumbles to the ground falling to
pieces hay spilling out of its tight clothing

The preacher grits his teeth

PREACHER (CONT’D)
Hoist him up there

A few of the men exchange glances then move to follow the
preacher’s order

Using ropes wrapped under the Father’s shoulders the men
pull him up onto the cross using the arms of the cross as
pulleys

Two men climb up onto the cross Gripping the Father’s arms
they bind him to the cross with loops of barbed wire
twisting the wire into knots with pliers

The Father struggles and kicks Two men on the ground begin
wrapping barbed wire around his legs The father is tied
tightly to the cross above them The barbs dig into the flesh
of his arms legs and torso raising dark droplets of blood

The men step away from the cross looking up at the straining
figure of the Father The Father twists against the cross
but the wires around his body are tight The burlap sack
still covers his face

One of the men looks down at the crumpled broken scarecrow
on the ground then reaches down and picks up the scarecrow’s
hat

MAN WITH HAT
Hang on a second

The man walks over to the cross lifts himself up and pulls
the scarecrow’s hat down tightly over the top of the Fathers
twisting head The man then drops off the cross and looks up
at the Father again

MAN WITH HAT (CONTD)
There we go

With the hat and burlap sack over his head the Father looks
just like a scarecrow The Father stops straining against the
ropes and hangs from the cross his body limp The preacher
addresses him

( )

PREACHER
You still don’t want to tell us what you
did with them

The Father hangs from the cross silent

PREACHER (CONT’D)
Fine We’ll see you get a little taste of
hell in this world before you pass on to
the next You’ll answer to a higher form
of justice than ours there

The Father’s voice is muffled by the burlap sack

FATHER
I’m not going to die if that’s what
youre hoping

The preacher looks up at him then exchanges glances with
several of the men

PREACHER
Well see about that
(to the men)
Come on

The man who put the hat on the Father addresses the preacher
his voice subdued

MAN WITH HAT
Do you want to search the house again

The preacher’s face is tense with either fury or strain

PREACHER
We’ll find nothing in there that we did
not find before Let us leave this place
immediately There is nothing more we can
do

The man nods slightly then the men and the preacher walk
through the cornfield away from the cross and the house The
sun glares down on the field

Up on the cross the Father begins vainly straining against
the barbed wire again In front of him the men work their
way through the cornfield without looking back the preacher
in the lead The Father shakes his head vigorously then
screams his shriek muffled by the burlap

BEGIN MONTAGE

( )

A) A bloody skinless figure tied to the basement floor
twitches in a wide pool of blood The Father’s scream is
still audible A shadow moves across the figure’s head where
the face used to be

B) A child’s eyes fly open A large hand is clamped over the
child’s mouth The child a young boy tries to yell but
cannot The child has no eyelashes or eyebrows

C) By candlelight the Father flips through pages of the
book He speaks unrecognizable syllables to himself as he
reads cutting at the top of his wrist with a knife

D) A closet door flies open Inside the closet the young
girl is huddled hiding in the clothes She cowers away from
the shadow that falls over her and makes a hissing sound

E) Blood flows across a wooden floor The pool of blood seeps
over towards a bed underneath which a slightly older boy is
hiding his eyes and mouth completely black He is shaking
and crying The blood moves closer to the boy who edges away
from it trying to move soundlessly Then a large boot steps
down into the pool of blood directly in front of the boy

F) A child’s body is dragged down the hallway the child’s
ankles sliding along the floor leave two trails of blood

END MONTAGE

END FLASHBACK

INT FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Annabelle jerks in her chair staring around the room wildly
Across from her Sam is slumped back in his chair his eyes

shut His arms hang limply at his sides

Annabelle scoots her chair away from the table and vomits
onto the floor

EXT CORNFIELD - NIGHT

William continues walking quickly through the cornstalks
following the path of broken and bent stalks Rain splatters
off William’s hat

Suddenly William is faced with tall upright stalks in front
of him The only bent stalks are behind William The trail

has come to an abrupt end in the middle of the field

William looks around There is nothing but cornstalks around
him and no indication of Clyde or where he may have gone

( )

William looks behind himself at the bent cornstalks but can
see nothing

WILLIAM
Clyde Where the fuck are you

William’s words are swallowed by the cornfield

INT FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Annabelle jumps out of her chair as the front door opens and
William steps in She then throws herself against him

sobbing

WILLIAM
Jesus honey What is it

ANNABELLE
I saw- I saw- I saw everything

WILLIAM
What did you see Here sit down

Annabelle sits back down in her chair William’s hands on her
shoulders William then notices Sam

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
What’s wrong with Sam

ANNABELLE
I- I don’t know

William reaches forward and shakes Sam’s arm then shakes it
again harder Sam does not stir William leans forward and
pushes Sam’s shoulder Sam slumps over onto the table

William slowly steps forward and puts his hand to Sam’s face
He holds his hand against Sam’s unmoving face for several
seconds then William bows his head slightly

ANNABELLE (CONTD)
What

WILLIAM
He’s He’s dead

Annabelle quickly puts her fingers to the side of Sam’s neck
Sam is not breathing

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
What the hell happened

ANNABELLE
I don’t know

( )

WILLIAM
What Was it his wound
ANNABELLE
It’s this place This place did something
to him

William gives her an incredulous look

WILLIAM
What do you mean this place

Annabelle puts her hand to her face breathing deeply She
then lowers her hand and returns William’s gaze her eyes
hard She speaks calmly

ANNABELLE
Jeffy Hollister was in love with me you
know

William frowns barely paying attention to her as he leans
forward and feels for a pulse in Sam’s neck

WILLIAM
What are you talking about

ANNABELLE
Jeffy was in love with me He used to say
it all the time before you got there He
hated you because of it I could see it
William He did

William looks at her

WILLIAM
So what

Annabelle opens her mouth to answer William then looks up at
the kitchen doorway Todd is leaning against the door barely
able to support himself

William and Annabelle both stare at Todd who stares back at
them

TODD
Didn’t you Didn’t you hear the

screaming

WILLIAM
Todd what are you talking about

( )

Todd stumbles over to the table and collapses into a chair
He reaches forward for the bottle of whiskey grabs it and
drinks heavily Todd’s eyes are glazed from fright

TODD
The screaming Didn’t you hear it

WILLIAM
We didn’t hear any screaming Todd

Todd buries his face in his hands

TODD
I think I’m going insane

ANNABELLE
Why What did you see

Todd grins his eyes serious

TODD
I don’t ever want to talk about that
Ever

Todd takes another drink

TODD (CONTD)
What’s the deal with Sam

ANNABELLE
Sams dead Todd

Todd looks over at Sam’s slumped form He reaches out and
touches Sam’s shoulder puzzled

TODD
How the hell did that happen

William steps forward towards Todd
WILLIAM
I was wondering if you might know

something about that

Todd looks at William confused then looks around the room
Realization dawns in Todd’s eyes

TODD
I don’t know what you’re talking about

WILLIAM
Don’t you

( )

Todd looks around the room again slowly

TODD
Where’s the gold William
WILLIAM
I don’t know Todd We left you watching

it

Todd looks into William’s eyes They stare at each other for
a moment

William’s gaze is locked on Todd but William’s right hand is
moving up towards his waistband where his pistol is stuck

ANNABELLE
William

Todd kicks out at a chair knocking the back of the chair
into William’s waist As William stumbles back pulling out
his pistol Todd lunges across the table and grabs Sam’s gun
from the holster on the side of Sam’s pants

Partly lying across Sam and the table Todd has Sam’s pistol
cocked and aimed at William before William regain his
balance

William freezes looking at Todd Todd is still slumped over
Sam He holds the gun aimed at William regarding William
with dead eyes William’s gun is aimed uselessly at the
floor

TODD
Where’s the gold William

The very tip of a scalpel blade gently enters the side of
Todds neck just under his earlobe Todd goes stiff

ANNABELLE
Two against one Todd What are you
thinking about
Todd blinks slowly

TODD
I’‘11 kill him Annabelle

ANNABELLE
Maybe He won’t be lonely long if you do

William remains still holding Todd’s gaze Todd sighs then
speaks with venom

( )

TODD
You lousy filthy double-crossing
bastards
WILLIAM

You watch yourself Todd You’ve ridden
with me for three years now I’ve saved
your life more times than I can count

TODD
That doesn’t make it yours

ANNABELLE
We don’t know where the gold is Todd We
didn’t take it You can check
(pause)
Why don’t you put the gun down

Annabelle turns the scalpel slightly in Todd’s neck letting
a little more blood flow down into his collar Todd shows no
visible reaction to this though he is sweating

Annabelle

TODD
If you didn’t take the gold who did

WILLIAM
We left you watching it Todd Remember

TODD
I didn’t fucking take it Where would I
put it

looks at William

ANNABELLE
We know you didn’t take it Todd An
unaccompanied Negro with four bags of
gold stands very little chance of getting
through Texas We know you wouldn’t try
that

William blinks and does not look entirely convinced but
cautiously sticks his pistol back into his waistband still
holding Todds gaze

WILLIAM
Yeah

Todd exhales slightly then pushes the hammer on Sam’s pistol

back into

place and places the pistol on the table After a

moment Annabelle tucks the scalpel back into her sleeve and
steps away

( )

Todd slumps back into his chair leaving the gun on the
table He puts his palms to his forehead and looks around the
room After a long moment of silence he speaks

TODD
Well I guess if you were planning to
kill me and take the money you would
have just done it

WILLIAM
You really don’t know what’s going on

TODD
I know we’ve got bigger problems than
that money We need to get the hell out
of here

ANNABELLE
I’m with you there

Todd frowns

TODD
Where’s Clyde

WILLIAM
He ran off into the cornfield a little
while ago I went looking but I couldn’t
find him

Todd slowly grows very still looking around the room He
looks out the window then looks back at William and
Annabelle

TODD
(softly)
Can you hear that

ANNABELLE
What

TODD
That voice Can you hear it

William and Annabelle look at each other then at Todd
TODD (CONTD)
You can’t hear it Out there in the

storm It’s speaking right now Listen

Todd cocks his head to the side listens then shakes his
head

( )

TODD (CONTD)
Now I can’t hear it Now it’s gone

WILLIAM
Todd-

TODD
(sighs)
Okay let’s forget Clyde then he’s gone
Let’s get on our horses and get the fuck
out of here Right now

WILLIAM
Without the gold

Todd looks into William’s eyes

TODD
Yes without the gold

WILLIAM
No way

Todd stands up knocking his chair back
TODD
I don’t care what you decide I’m getting

out of here

Todd grabs Sam’s pistol and the half-empty bottle of whiskey
He looks at William

TODD (CONTD)
Ill take these if you don’t mind

Without another word Todd storms out of the front room
through the front door William and Annabelle look at each
other then quickly head out after him

EXT SIDE YARD - NIGHT

Todd rapidly walks through the side yard almost running
through the rain William and Annabelle hurry after him

WILLIAM
Todd Wait up

Todd does not slow his pace William and Annabelle continue
after him towards the barn Lightning flashes

INT BARN - NIGHT

Todd in the lead comes to an abrupt stop in the entrance to
the barn William and Annabelle almost collide with him

WILLIAM
What

Todd is silent He stands in the entrance to the barn his
shoulders heaving slightly After a moment William moves
forward standing next to Todd and looking into the barn

The horses have been shredded their bodies ripped into small
pieces that have been strewn all over the inside of the barn
The stacks of hay are splattered red with blood Blood drips
from several spots on the barn’s ceiling One of the horses
appears to have been bisected across its middle and lies in
two halves directly in front of Todd

Annabelle involuntarily steps back from the sight

ANNABELLE
Oh my god

Todd steps forward and picks up the severed leg of one of the
horses The bloody end of it is ragged with cracked bone
sticking out of the flesh Todd looks at the horse’s leg and
begins laughing quietly

William and Annabelle exchange a look Todd glances at them
then looks back at the mangled horses

TODD
Looks like I’m walking

Todd glares at a horse’s severed head The horse’s eyes are
open and its tongue sticks out of its mouth

TODD (CONTD)
What are you looking at

Todd throws the leg at the horse’s head but misses

TODD (CONTD)
Ugly son of a bitch

WILLIAM
Todd You alright

TODD
No I’m not

Todd turns away from William

( )

TODD (CONTD)
If you’d seen what I saw you’d know
what’s going on here

WILLIAM
What did you see

Todd does not answer William just walks further into the
barn gesturing angrily

TODD
You’d fucking know something that’s for
sure

William looks over at Annabelle

ANNABELLE
What could do this to the horses
William It would It would have to be

the size of a bear

TODD
(screaming)
What the hell could do this to the
horses William

Todd points at William and Annabelle his arm rigid

TODD (CONTD)
There are things that exist alongside us
things that were once like us but just
kept going who live not in the places we
know but in the spaces between them Do
you think it matters how big they are

There is a silence Thunder rumbles Todd pauses lowering
his arm

TODD (CONTD)
Listen

Todd crouches down slightly From no visible source a VOICE
begins speaking to Todd The voice speaks softly slurring
its words together

VOICE (0S)
There were once others here whose skin
was like yours The one whose skin was
like theirs gave them to us We enjoyed
them very much Are you tired

Todd turns to William and Annabelle his face stricken

( )

TODD
Please Please William Annabelle
Can you hear it

William looks at Annabelle who shakes her head at Todd Todd
looks around the barn listening to the voice shaking

VOICE (0S)
I’m up here

Todd looks up at the loft section of the barn The loft is
dark nothing is visible there

ANNABELLE
It’s just the storm Todd

Todd shakes his head The voice continues speaking to him

TODD
(to Annabelle)
It’s up in the loft

VOICE (0S)

They call you Todd

(pause)
The man brought us here so we would bring
him back his wife He gave us strength so
we would help him We liked that but we
could only bring parts of her back Those
weren’t enough for him So we took parts
of his children to make more of her We
understood him then

Todd squeezes his eyes shut tears running down his face He
begins swaying back and forth as the voice continues

VOICE (CONT’D)
He didn’t like that either And now we
can’t go Now this is where I live
(pause)
Are you tired Would you like to lie down
here for a little while

Todd suddenly clamps his hands to his ears and screams

TODD
Stop talking

The voice is silent Todd stares around the barn William and

Annabelle are watching him Todd looks back up at the loft
Nothing is there

( )

WILLIAM
Todd Do you want to leave now

Todd slowly lifts his hands up to his face His eyes are wet

TODD
I can’t trust my own eyes anymore I
think

Todd gestures at the horses

TODD (CONTD)
Did this Did this really happen

WILLIAM
Come on We’re going to get out of here
We’re going to leave this place

TODD
There’s worse things than dying you
know

WILLIAM

I know Come on
Todd follows William and Annabelle outside of the barn
EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT

William Annabelle and Todd stand by the well William looks
up into the rain

Todd reaches for the rope to the well’s bucket He pulls on
it trying to pull the rope up but cannot The bucket
appears to be stuck on something Frustrated Todd throws
down the rope lifts his head to the sky and opens his mouth
drinking the rain

WILLIAM
God damn this storm

ANNABELLE
The sooner we get out of here the
better

WILLIAM

What do we do about Sam

ANNABELLE
He’s dead William

William is silenced for a moment

( )

WILLIAM
Id like to know who’s doing this to us
that’s all If they’d just show
themselves

Todd shakes his head wiping the rain across his face

TODD
I don’t think you want that at all

ANNABELLE
Come on William

William stares at Todd and Annabelle

WILLIAM
You two seriously want to just leave
here Without our gold

TODD

(shivering)
Are you fucking kidding me You want to
look for the gold William that’s fine
I’m sure it’s somewhere around here Good
luck with that I just want to get out of
here and forget everything about this
place Then I’1l be happy forever

(pause)
Shit

Annabelle puts her hand on William’s chest

ANNABELLE
Weve got our guns We can get more

William looks at her she holds his gaze Todd looks around
then walks past them towards the front of the house After a
moment Annabelle and William follow him

EXT FRONT YARD —- NIGHT

Todd Annabelle and William reach the front yard William
stops looking into the house

WILLIAM
Just let me I need to go in and say
goodbye to Sam

Annabelle nods Todd looks around quickly wiping rain off
his face

TODD
Hurry

( )

William nods and walks into the front door of the house A
moment later he steps out lantern held aloft

WILLIAM
He’s not here

Annabelle and Todd look at each other quickly then move
towards the house

INT FRONT ROOM —- NIGHT

Sams chair is empty William Todd and Annabelle look around
the deserted room

TODD
They took his body Let’s go

WILLIAM
What Who did Why would they do that

TODD
Lots of reasons How should I know

Annabelle looks sharply at William

ANNABELLE
What
WILLIAM
Maybe Maybe he’s not dead
ANNABELLE
You checked for a pulse yourself
William
WILLIAM

Maybe I was wrong Maybe I missed it

TODD
He looked pretty dead man

WILLIAM
I could’ve been wrong Maybe he just
walked out of here

TODD
He didn’t look like he was about to start
walking anywhere

WILLIAM
Well he’s not here right now

( )

TODD
I agree with you there William And I
think we should go

William looks at Annabelle who slowly nods

ANNABELLE
He was dead William The infection from
the bullet wound spread to his heart
Whoever took his body took it to keep us
here

William looks at the floor then looks outside
WILLIAM
The first thing I’m gonna do when we get
to Mexico is hire some guys and send them
up here to burn this place to the fucking
ground

TODD
That might not be such a good idea

WILLIAM
I don’t care

William walks out into the rain

EXT FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Todd Annabelle and William move over towards the cornfield
When they reach the rows William suddenly reaches down and

picks an object up off the ground

WILLIAM
It’s Sam’s shoe

William holds the leather boot out for Annabelle and Todd to
see

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
He’s got to be somewhere in the
cornfield

Todd and Annabelle look at each other

ANNABELLE
We’ve got to head this way anyway

WILLIAM
Come on

( )

William pushes his way into the cornfield roughly shoving
rows to the side Todd and Annabelle move after him along
the trail he is creating

EXT CORNFIELD - NIGHT
William stumbles through the cornfield Annabelle and Todd
close behind him Abruptly he stops reaching another trail

going through the cornfield

TODD
What’s this

WILLIAM
Another trail

William looks closely at the stump of a broken cornstalk He
feels at it with his thumb

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Someone came through here recently

TODD

Let’s just get out of here
WILLIAM

Come on We have to head in this

direction
William begins heading down the trail he has just discovered
his feet sinking slightly in the mud of the trail as he
walks Annabelle follows him

Todd looks around the cornfield squinting against the rain
After a moment he follows Annabelle and William

EXT CORNFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

William and Annabelle stumble against the rain Visibility is
poor in front of them

They stagger into the clearing with the wooden cross The
form of the scarecrow is tied to the cross William looks up
at the scarecrow wiping rain from his eyes

Annabelle backs away clearly terrified to be near the
scarecrow

ANNABELLE
Come on William

( )

WILLIAM
I could’ve sworn this is where we were
before

Todd steps into the clearing

TODD
What

WILLIAM
Well at least we’re headed in the right
direction

TODD

Wait a minute
Todd is looking up at the scarecrow intently

TODD (CONTD)
Something’s wrong

William squints up at the scarecrow barely able to see
through the rain Just then the scarecrow on the cross
suddenly twists and emits a moaning sound

Todd Annabelle and William all take a quick step away from
the cross The scarecrow arches its back and twists against
the ropes that are binding it to the cross

ANNABELLE
(almost crying)
Let’s go
TODD
No wait

Todd moves closer to the scarecrow

TODD (CONTD)
Clyde

The scarecrow’s body twists again sharply William steps
forward

WILLIAM
My god Those are Clyde’s clothes

TODD
Is it him

William looks at Todd

( )

WILLIAM
Let’s find out

William hands his lantern to Annabelle

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Here

William carefully approaches the wooden cross removing a
knife from his boot

With the knife between his teeth William climbs up the back
of the cross carefully avoiding contact with the scarecrow
which is no longer moving Todd and Annabelle watch William
anxiously Todd has a hand on the butt of his gun

Using the knife William begins cutting at the ropes wrapped
around the scarecrow’s body

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
He’s tied up with hemp Hold on a second

Todd moves closer to the scarecrow The scarecrow writhes and
moans again The moan is muffled by the burlap sack over its
head Todd looks nervous

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Hang on Clyde Don’t move so much we’re
cutting you loose

The scarecrow continues writhing In a moment William has
cut through the rope around the scarecrow’s right arm and
torso

The scarecrow sways forward then slips out of the remaining
ropes and falls forward off the cross Todd reaches out to
catch the scarecrow The scarecrow hits Todd and they both
fall to the ground

William jumps off the cross and moves over to Todd who rolls
away from the scarecrow Todd rises to his feet

The scarecrow twists miserably on the ground as if barely
able to move its body Annabelle William and Todd look down
at it hesitating

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Here hold on

William bends down and reaches for the burlap sack over the

scarecrow’s head Annabelle edges away Todd surreptitiously
reaches into his holster and removes his pistol cocking it

( )

William pulls off the burlap sack revealing Clyde’s face
Clyde’s eyelids mouth and nostrils have been sewn shut with
black yarn The flaps of Clyde’s ears have been sewn forward
to the sides of his face Clyde struggles to speak pulling
at the stitches on his mouth and eyes but is only able to
moan

ANNABELLE
Oh my god

William and Todd stare at Clyde with horror After a moment
William leans forward with his knife as if to cut the
stitches on Clyde’s face He hesitates near the yarn on
Clyde’s mouth as Clyde writhes in pain

WILLIAM
Uh Annabelle do you have a scalpel or
something in your bag

ANNABELLE
Yeah sure

Annabelle begins fumbling through her satchel

WILLIAM
Wed better use that

Todd leans forward to pluck some of the hay out of Clyde’s
shirt which is bloody in spots Todd pauses then feels
lightly at Clyde’s chest

TODD
Uh

Todd presses down on Clyde’s chest hesitates then pushes up
Clydes shirt

Clyde’s torso has been torn open and filled up with bloody
hay Broken ribs poke up through the sides of Clyde’s torso
as if his sternum was cracked away from his rib cage Wads of
dried hay have been plunged into Clyde’s stomach and lungs

WILLIAM
Oh

William staggers back a step looking faint Todd as if
unable to stop himself pulls at Clyde’s sleeves Clyde’s
wrists have been slit and hay has been shoved into the cuts

Clyde continues to twist and moan on the ground as Todd
checks his body

( )

ANNABELLE
What What did they do to him

William’s looks up at her his face crumpling

WILLIAM
What is going on

Clyde suddenly stops moving then his head slowly lolls to
the side to face Todd With his stitched-shut lips and eyes
Clyde smiles widely up at Todd Todd recoils in fear

TODD
What the hell

Todd shoves at Clyde’s head Clyde’s head immediately rolls
away from his body into the rows of corn out of sight
Clyde’s neck is a bloody stump from which a few stalks of
dried hay protrude

Clydes body lies still on the ground hay sticking out of
his clothes

Todd rises to his feet shaking uncontrollably William is
still squatting looking at Clyde’s body in shock

WILLIAM
What is going on here

ANNABELLE
Come on William Get up We need to go

Todd still not looking at William or Annabelle looks around
the cornfield

TODD
We’re never going to leave here

ANNABELLE

Yes we are Todd We’re going right now
Come on

TODD
No we’re not

Todd’s mouth twists as if he is about to cry
TODD (CONTD)
I don’t want to die here I don’t want to

have to stay here

ANNABELLE
Come on then

( )

Todd ignores Annabelle looking around the cornfield Just
beneath the sound of the wind whipping the cornstalks
several voices can be heard whispering under the wind The
voices sound like those of small children They babble over
each other possibly in foreign tongues their words
impossible to understand

Annabelle watches Todd Todd stands transfixed

TODD
Tell me you hear it now Annabelle

ANNABELLE
Hear what
(pause)
I just hear the wind

Todd looks around

TODD
They say I’m next

ANNABELLE
No youre not Todd No one is We’re
getting out of here

William shakes his head and rises to his feet

WILLIAM
Come on Todd You’re hearing things
It’s just the storm

Todd shakes his head slightly The voices grow louder over
the wind becoming urgent and angry

TODD
(softly)
No it isn’t

Todd steps forward towards the cornfield almost stumbling
over Clyde’s body Todd looks down at Clyde’s body his face
stiffening Todd then looks up clear-eyed and addresses the
cornfield

TODD (CONTD)
You may not let me leave here but I
won’t let you take me

With that Todd places the barrel of his pistol in his mouth
cocking the hammer

WILLIAM
Todd No

( )

Todd pulls the trigger The round bullet sends blood and bone
fragments spurting out of the back of Todd’s head

Todd stays upright for a moment looking dazed then blood
flows from his open mouth and he crumples to the ground
dead

William stands above Todd astonished Todd’s body lies next
to Clyde’s Annabelle grabs at William’s arm pulling at him

ANNABELLE
Come on

William mutely follows her further into the cornfield
Annabelle begins to run William follows

EXT CORNFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Annabelle and William rush through the cornfield
occasionally slipping in the mud with Annabelle in the lead
Annabelle is running intently through the corn William
staggers after her trying to keep up

WILLIAM
Slow down

ANNABELLE
Come on

Annabelle continues rushing forward through the cornstalks
The wind and rain whips into her face and the cornstalks are
being blown back towards her

Behind her William slips and falls flat on his face in the
mud He struggles to his feet slips and falls back down
again Grabbing onto the cornstalks William hauls himself
upright and stumbles forward again

He can no longer see Annabelle she is too far ahead William
runs forward in her general direction

WILLIAM
Annabelle

William’s words are drowned out by a sudden clap of thunder
He plunges forward through the cornstalks

EXT CORNFIELD - NIGHT
Annabelle continues racing forward still lighter on her feet

than William She runs through the dark cornfield shouting
out

( )

ANNABELLE
We’ve got to be near the road by now

There is no response from behind her Still running
Annabelle looks over her left shoulder There is nothing
behind her but cornstalks She comes to a stop looking back
EXT CORNFIELD - NIGHT

William continues running looking around Inside the
cornfield it is impossible to determine what direction he is

headed in

Winded William slows to a stop looking around He is
surrounded on all sides by thick cornstalks

WILLIAM
(screaming)
Annabelle

There is no response William gasps for air looking around

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Christ

EXT CORNFIELD — NIGHT

Annabelle puts her hands to her mouth and shouts trying to
be heard over the rain

ANNABELLE
William

There is no response from the cornfield Annabelle takes a
step forward moving deeper into the cornfield then stops
looking behind her in the general direction of the trail

ANNABELLE (CONT’D)
Come on William Where are you

Annabelle shifts her feet nervously her eyes wide with fear
unwilling to move in either direction

EXT CORNFIELD - NIGHT
Deeper in the cornfield William catches his breath

WILLIAM
Annabelle

( )

William looks around then takes a step forward and freezes
A few feet to William’s right a dark figure is just visible
moving in the cornstalks The figure immediately disappears
obscured by the cornstalks

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Annabelle

William moves in the direction of the figure peering forward
anxiously Suddenly a child’s giggle comes from directly
behind William

William stops moving and stands very still He slowly moves
his right hand onto the butt of his pistol staring straight
ahead into the cornfield

In a sudden motion William spins around drawing his pistol
out in front of him No one is there William takes a step
back brandishing his pistol

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Who’s there

In the cornstalks directly in front of William in a space in
between two haphazard rows the figure briefly appears again
passing between the rows

The figure’s body is lumpy and large and the figure is
wearing a hat it is clearly not Annabelle but it is too
dark to see any further details before the figure moves
behind another row of corn

William cocks the hammer on his pistol nervously moving
forward looking around as he does so He whispers almost to
himself

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Annabelle

EXT CORNFIELD — NIGHT

Annabelle looks around again then clenches her jaw and
begins moving forward deeper into the cornfield

ANNABELLE
William

EXT CORNFIELD — NIGHT

William looks around shielding his eyes from the rain
Lightning flashes followed immediately by thunder

( )

A wild animal cry comes from the cornstalks near William The
cornstalks move as if something small is running through
them

William jumps twisting his gun towards the direction of the
sound Nothing is visible in the cornstalks A low gentle
human sobbing softly comes from the cornstalks near William
William’s face fills with fear

WILLIAM
Who’s out there

There is no response and the sobbing noise gradually fades
away William looks around

Lightning flashes and ten feet away from William in the
cornfield the figure of a scarecrow is visible The
scarecrow pushes its way through the cornstalks angrily
making its way through the field towards the house

As William stares at the scarecrow the scarecrow suddenly
stops moving and turns its head towards William The
scarecrow has no eyes or face just a burlap sack The
scarecrow and William face each other frozen then the
scarecrow cocks its head slightly

The lightning ends and the field is immediately dark again
the scarecrow is no longer visible William quickly raises
his gun and fires towards the direction of the scarecrow The
gunshot echoes through the field

There is no response from the section of the cornfield
William just aimed at William pauses for a moment staring
ahead then quickly breaks his pistol and begins urgently
reloading it looking in front of himself while doing so

William’s hands are shaking so badly that he can barely load
his pistol but he finally manages to do so instantly
cocking his pistol again and holding it out in front of him
He looks around the field backing up

In front of William the cornstalks move to the side the
dark figure of the scarecrow is briefly visible passing
through the stalks towards William William points his gun
at the figure but does not fire as the figure immediately
disappears from view

William’s lower jaw is trembling and he breathes in short
gasps

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Shit

( )

A splashing sound comes from William’s other side he spins
around aiming his pistol in this direction his hand
shaking Just then a howling noise like that of an animal
in pain or dying comes from in front of William he twists
in that direction with a sharp cry

From behind William a dark figure suddenly bursts through
the cornstalks moving directly towards William’s back
William spins around stumbling away and immediately fires
at the dark figure

The figure instantly comes to a stop then takes a step
backwards and falls back in between two stalks of corn
unmoving The figure lies still on the ground shrouded by
the darkness of the cornfield Only the figure’s shoes are
visible

William falls to his knees in front of the figure sobbing
hysterically

EXT CORNFIELD - EARLY MORNING

The sun’s first rays shine over the cornfield The rain has
ceased though the cornstalks are still damp in appearance
The morning light is faint but illuminates the entire
cornfield

William is still sitting in the mud Annabelle’s body lies in
front of him Her eyes are shut The blood on her forehead
has congealed and is almost black around the bullet wound
where William shot her

William stares straight ahead his face blank His hair is
pasted to his head He looks aimlessly into the cornfield

EXT CORNFIELD —- MORNING

The cornfield is now bright with the morning sun William is
still sitting next to Annabelle staring straight ahead He
then turns his head and looks at Annabelle

Reaching out William puts his hand to the side of
Annabelle’s face His jaw trembles then he takes his hand
away looks away from Annabelle’s corpse and rises to his
feet

William’s gun lies several feet away from him half-buried in
the mud William moves towards the rows of corn then freezes
as a sudden growling sound comes from directly in front of
him

William looks down slowly his body still Dog is standing in
front of William between two haphazard rows of corn

( )

Dogs hackles are up and Dog’s teeth are bared Dog snarls at
William saliva dripping from its mouth

WILLIAM
(softly)
Dog

Dog growls again eyes fixed on William’s All the hairs on
Dog’s back are sticking up straight

William slowly reaches into his coat for his gun His gun is
not there William realizes this then slowly looks for his
gun William’s gun is about a yard in front of him The gun
is between William and Dog

William carefully begins edging forward toward the gun Dog
growls again crouching down William comes to a stop then
when Dog does not move begins moving towards the gun again

Dog lunges forward at William snarling William raises his
arm to block Dog and Dog’s teeth clamp down on William’s
forearm William yells

The weight of Dog knocks William to the ground William
flails against Dog trying to pull his bloody arm out of
Dogs mouth The dog thrashes its head wildly mangling
William’s arm William screams

William rolls over onto Dog yanking his arm out of Dog’s
teeth A chunk of William’s arm is left in Dog’s jaw Dog
immediately twists away from William’s grasp and bites onto
William’s upper leg tearing at William’s flesh

William yells again then lifts his other leg up and kicks
Dog in the head The blow knocks Dog back away from William
towards William’s gun The dog scrambles regaining its
balance

William immediately rises to his feet He sees that Dog is
nearer to the gun than him then turns and runs Limping
badly William stumbles forward through the cornfield in the
general direction of the trail

Dog is immediately after William running quickly through the
cornfield The fur on the front of Dog’s body is slick with
William’s blood

William runs as fast as he can plowing through the
cornstalks He looks behind himself and can see Dog rushing
up just behind him growling William plunges forward

Wounded William cannot possibly outrun Dog and Dog is

gaining fast Dog is within ten feet of William’s heels as
William stumbles forward

( )

Dog comes closer snapping at William’s ankles Then Dog
suddenly comes to a stop staring straight ahead

William continues desperately running forward oblivious to
the fact that Dog is no longer directly behind him

Suddenly William bursts out of the cornfield into the
light Blinded William squints trying to shield his eyes
from the sun A gunshot booms from directly in front of him

William’s chest explodes He falls back into the cornfield
EXT TRAIL - MORNING

A group of ten Confederate soldiers stand on the trail
looking at something on the ground Half of them are perched
on top of horses the others hold the horses’ reins One man
JOHNSTON is holding a smoking rifle He looks down at the
object on the ground with evident revulsion

JOHNSTON
What the hell is that

One of the men shakes his head moving closer

On the ground with half of its body inside the field lies a
medium-sized furry creature It is dead a wide blood-soaked
bullet wound gaping in the soft white fur of its chest The
creature has a face like a furry pig’s it is the same type
of creature that Sam shot

A confederate soldier with a thick mustache leans forward and
spits then squints up at the house in front of them

MUSTACHED SOLDIER
That’s the damned ugliest thing I’ve ever
seen

JOHNSTON
(laughs nervously)
That thing sure jumped out at us didn’t
it Gave me a scare

One of the men on a horse wearing a more elaborate uniform
clears his throat This is the CAPTAIN

CAPTAIN
Well unless you’re fixing to eat it
leave it alone Johnston and Kormer you
two go check out that house and barn I’m
sure they’ve moved on if they came this
way but just make sure nothing’s there
The place looks abandoned and it wouldn’t
have been a bad spot to spend the night

( )

Johnston and another red-haired man step away from the
group towards the cornfield

CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
The rest of us will continue You two
water your horses and give them some
grain see what you can find You can
catch up with us later in the day

Johnston and Kormer nod pulling their horses with them

The captain and the seven other soldiers continue down the
trail Leading their horses Johnston and Kormer step into
the cornfield and begin working their way through the tall
stalks towards the house A light breeze sways the
cornstalks that surround them

FADE OUT

THE END
