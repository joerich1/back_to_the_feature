ROSA KLEB is looking into a desktop aquarium She moves
backwards looking down at it

BLOFELD (0OS)
Siamese fighting fish Fascinating
creatures Brave but on the
whole stupid

KLEBS POV - THE AQUARIUM
Three fish swim in it

BLOFELD (0OS)
Yes theyre stupid

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELDS LAP
A white cat rests in his lap and he pets it

BLOFELD (0OS)
Except for the occasional one such
as we have here

CLOSE SHOT - AQUARIUM

The fish swim around each other and then in quick cuts fight
each other

BLOFELD (0OS)
who lets the other two fight
while he waits waits until the
survivor is so exhausted that he
cannot defend himself
KLEB

watches the aquarium

CLOSE SHOT - AQUARIUM

The fish continue to fight

BLOFELD (0OS)
And then like SPECTRE he strikes

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELDS CAT
He continues to stroke it
BLOFELD

while we listen to what Number
Five has devised for us
CLOSE-UP - KLEB

KLEB
I hope Kronsteens efforts as
Director of Planning will continue
to be as successful as his chess

CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN

KRONSTEEN
They will be According to your
instructions I have planned for
SPECTRE to steal from the Russians
their new Lektor decoding machine
For this we need the services of a
female member of the Russian
cryptograph section in Turkey and —
- uh —- the help of the British
Secret Service

CLOSE-UP - KLEB
Listening she looks up at Kronsteen

KRONSTEEN (0S)
(continuing)
Naturally neither the Russians nor
the British will be aware

CLOSE-UP - BLOFELDS CAT
He continues to pet it

KRONSTEEN (0S)
(continuing)
that they are now working for
us

BLOFELD (0OS)
Number Three is your section ready
to carry out Kronsteens directives

CLOSE-UP - KLEB

KLEB
Yes Number One The operation
will be organized according to
Kronsteens plan I have selected
a suitable girl from the Russian
Consulate in Istanbul Shes
capable cooperative and her
loyalty to the State is beyond
question
WIDE ANGLE OVER BLOFELD AT KLEB AND KRONSTEEN

BLOFELD
And youre absolutely sure she
believes youre still

CLOSE-UP - BLOFELDS CAT
He continues to stroke it

BLOFELD

Intelligence

CLOSE-UP - KLEB

KLEB
It is most unlikely she would know
Im now working for SPECTRE
Moscow has kept my defection secret
from everyone but a few members of
the Presidium

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELDS CAT

As he stroke it

WW

LOFELD
For your sake I hope so

BLOFELDS POV - KLEB AND KRONSTEEN
BLOFELD (0OS)

Kronsteen youre sure this plan is
foolproof

RONSTEEN
(tapping a cigarette
against its case)

Yes it is because have

anticipated every possible

variation of counter-move

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELDS CAT
As he strokes it

BLOFELD
But what makes you think that M
the head of British intelligence
will oblige you by falling in with
your plan
CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN

KRONSTEEN

For the simple reason that it is so
obviously a trap

(he starts to put the

cigarette into his

mouth then lowers it)
My reading of the British mentality
is that they always treat a trap as
a challenge And in any case they
couldnt possibly pass up even the
slightest chance of getting their
hands on a Lektor decoder They
have wanted one for years

CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELDS CAT

As he strokes it

BLOFELD (0OS)
Um-hmm All that you say could be
true What else

CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN

KRONSTEEN
As an added refinement I think
that SPECTRE would probably have
the added chance of a personal
revenge for the killing of our
operative Doctor No Because the
man the British will almost
certainly use on a mission of this
sort would be their agent James
Bond

ANGLE OVER BLOFELD AT KLEB AND KRONSTEEN

KLEB

BLOFELD
Let his death be a particularly
unpleasant and humiliating one

RONSTEEN
Good I shall put my plan into
operation straightaway

speaking Did you enjoy it

whip hard against
