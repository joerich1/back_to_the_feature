Note Everything in this movie is slightly off Clothing
doesnt fit pretty people are not pretty There are
perspiring brows and sweat-stained clothing grand locations
are meager special effects look cheap Its a broken seedy
world trying to sell us a bill of goods

BLACKNESS --

-- gives way to pre-dawn Eerily-lit hilly landscape
peppered with radio towers Unearthly colors occasional
flashes of brilliant odd light The breeze becomes a distant
voice singing

FEMALE VOICE SINGING
I listen to the breezeI listen to
the wavesBoth radio and oceanTo
the lunatic who ravesI listen to
my thoughtsTo my memories and
fearsto the sad commercial
jinglesIve learned throughout the
yearsI listen to the laugh
tracksI listen to the newsI
listen to the liarsas they
propagate their oozeI listen to my
parentsI listen to my bossI
listen to it allI cannot turn it
off

Their conversation goes under as we move to Grape Snow
sitting at his desk typing on his laptop singing what he is
typing We catch the tale end of it

GRAPE
“Song in my Heart” is a bilious
messA festering pile of intestinal
distressThe sub-moron intellect of

their true calling is as self-
fellators

Jonathan Waller is the worst
director in the history of cinema

The women cackle

OLD MOVIE STAR 1
They dont know what movies are

terrible truth

INT OSCAR AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The auditorium is small and seedy Audience seems overly-
enthusiastic The Emcee sings perspiring brow one hand in
the pocket of his tux

EMCEE

(singing)
Will it be me Will it be me
Will they call my name tonight
What will I say What will I say
As I stand there in the light
Will I be funny witty or trite
Ill make more money Isnt that
right

Inside his pocket his hand fiddles with keys on an cartoon
cat key chain Theres also a roll of candies called
Oochies and a desiccated severed human thumb

Behind the Emcee dancers some in tuxedoes some in gowns
coupled with others dressed as gold statuettes go through
their paces a little off in their timing

Inside one of the statuette costumes a dancer has a severe
nose bleed She swabs it with a soaked tissue and sings

DANCER
It wont stop Why wont it
stopIm bleeding out drop by
drop -- by drop by drop

EXT OSCAR AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

As the song continues we travel from the theater past
transmitters past protesters -- we pause on one tense
drawn man with a placard depicting an aborted fetus and the
handwritten slogan Save the Babbies

PLACARD MAN (SINGING)
Fags niggers JewsThere is no
right to chooseGod will smite each
one of youse fags niggers Jews

We continue past satellite dishes and radio towers through
the late afternoon Los Angeles sunshine and pollution over
hillside fires through neighborhoods past an eight year old
boy being beaten by a stronger eight year old boy

(CONTTNURFD )

WEAKER BOY (SINGING)
I must deserve thisThat much is
clearIm not a real boyI live in
fearI must deserve thisI must
deserve thisfor being a queer

We pass through houses in which people watch the Oscars (in
this clip we see one of the Oscar statuette dancers fall
over) or news (now we see a news reporter backstage at the
Oscars where the gold statuette dancers costume is being
cut off by paramedics revealing that she is soaked in
blood) or people listening to the radio or reading or on
computers We travel through exurban sprawl rainfall
desserts over mountains into and through a the aisle of a
commercial jet in flight past passengers watching movies on
little screens We pause on the face of a sleeping middle-
aged female passenger and move into her dream She is at a
department store make-up counter talking to the stony young
woman behind the counter They sing a duet

MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGER
Can you assist me

STONY YOUNG CLERK
Im the make-up clinician

MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGER
Would you make me desirable

STONY YOUNG CLERK
Im not a magician

MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGER
Well how about passable

STONY YOUNG CLERK
In a very dark room

MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGER
Ill take just less miserable

STONY YOUNG CLERK
You ask for the moon

MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGER
So how can you help me with whats
on your shelf

STONY YOUNG CLERK
(indicating face creams)
Your choicesRidiculous
InvisibleAshamed of Yourself

(CONTTNURFD )

We move out of her dream out of the jet over windy plains
We see from up above the weird flashes of colored lights
All the while its getting darker colder Snow begins to
fall We drift past an old man without coat or boots
trudging through the blizzard

OLD MAN (SINGING)
Did I ever tell you thisI might
have told you thisThat a hundred
years ago walking through a
snowfall -- just like thisI got a
kissI must have told you thisa
hundred times alreadyI think her
name was BettyWe were going
steadyShe was your mom I
thinkBut Im no longer sureI
think that now shes deadForgive
me for not knowing anymore

We pass by houses with TV-glow windows with computer-glow
windows Everything feels glum and makeshift Even the
cameras journey is clumsily implemented

EMCEE (0S)

Will they applaud Will they
applaud Standing ovation Or
call me a fraud Will I cry tears
Thank all my peers Express all my
fearsWill I adhere to my notes
Thank all of them for their votes
Will it be me Will it be me Will
it be me ton-i-i-i-ght

Mixed with the singing we hear commercials for unfamiliar
products and news reports about murdered children natural
disasters political corruption the din of other broadcast
noise recited tweet commentary and rain and wind And
singing always singing We travel a long way into the
heart of winter of night of Franciss window

INT FRANCISS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Posters for movies weve never heard of on the walls classy
foreign films from long ago Francis mid-20s and
charmless watches the Oscars on a bulky TV There is also a
bulky computer (looking like something from Russia from the
50s) on which he contributes to live Oscar postings

VOICE 1 (SINGING)
That song was bad

(CONTTNURFD )

VOICE 2 (SINGING)
Her gown is sad

FRANCIS (SINGING AND TYPING)

image of him in a very fat suit

EMCEE (CONTD)

INT FRANCISS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Francis watches On the computer screen someone types How
much does Stone have to pay that girl to suck on his
shriveled octogenarian pudendum

EMCEE
Yknow the Oscars would be a good
place to set one of those 1970s
disaster movies Yknow You got
all the movie stars sitting here
right Then theres an earthquake
or a bomb or something -- Kabloom -
- and you all have to claw your way
out of the wreckage arms hanging
off Oscars impaling starlets
Id pay good money to see that
movie -- and to impale some
starlets Am I right Bob Stone

Francis turns and talks in a mumble in our general
direction but not quite on target as if he imagines he has
an audience but is wrong about where we are

FRANCIS
Its fascinating to watch pathetic
pop culture extravaganzae such as
the Oscars Theyre worthless as a
gauge of quality film but it does
offer us invaluable insight into
our abysmal zeitgeist

Silence Francis suddenly looks lonely He dials his phone

FRANCIS (CONTD)
(into phone)
Have you been watching this
pathetic pop culture extravaganza

RANDY (PHONE VOICE)
Yeah Abysmal Fascinating to
watch the zeitgeist play out in
such a tawdry dance number

(CONTTNURFD )

FRANCIS
Must you always copy me Youre
not even coughing by the way

RANDY (PHONE VOICE)
Im under the weather Yknow I
just thought it would be safer for
you for me to watch from here I
was thinking of you Francis
(beat coughs)

FRANCIS
Well too bad for you Enjoy your
micro-screen experience while I
enjoy the costly and vastly
superior alternative

There is applause for something on TV

Dick Murphy for all his innovative was done forty

support and love and oh years ago and better by

theyre telling me to go William Cavanaugh Nobody

Thank you all I love you -- knows that But me The
Wind and the Rain will sweep
tonight

The Emcee returns as Serapilia is ushered off stage by a

model with a very slight limp

EMCEE
Before we continue Id like to do
a quick PSA Throwing up is bad
for you unless youre poisoned
And then only in some cases not
for example if youve ingested a
caustic agent In that case call
a poison control center
immediately But for the purposes
of being bulimic which is not the
same as being anorexic its always
bad This announcement brought to
you by Peppermint Smackles No one
ever wants to throw up a Smackle --
and not just because theyre
caustic -- but because theyre also
delicious

A post appears on Franciss computer screen Fuck Alan
Modell Im bulimic and my sister died of bulimia Its not
a fucking joke Francis picks up the phone and is about to
dial when he notices there is no dial tone

FRANCIS
Hello Is someone there

He cradles his phone between ear and shoulder as he types on
the computer These pathetic emotional morons have no sense
of compassion for those with eating disorders which this
industry perpetuates by the way

FEMALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
Francis Is anyone there

FRANCIS

phone to call Randy

FRANCIS
Thanks for the sage advice Mom

Francis hangs up zips his coat as he watches the commercial
The man driving the car has a sheen of perspiration on his

INT FRANCISS BOYHOOD HOME - CONTINUOUS
Francis enters into the kitchen His mother and father are
at the table The news is on the TV a crying family on a

Francis switches back to the Oscars

Hiroshima

On the TV four tuxedoed men make their way to the stage
stopping to shake the hand of a standing applauding Jonathan
Waller On the onstage screen we see a violent but fake-
looking version of an atomic explosion decimating Hiroshima

FRANCIS (CONTD)
I cant believe they gave anything
to that exploitative crapfest

FRANCISS MOTHER
Those people should be arrested

FRANCIS
Who Whom I mean
FRANCISS MOTHER FRANCIS
The Alzheimers mans family Think about the Japanese

descendents of those victims
of American adventurism
America should be arrested

(CONTTNURFD )

FRANCISS FATHER
Our country did a racist thing

FRANCISS MOTHER
You have to watch the Alzheimers
people constantly Its like old
person abuse if you dont Which
is as bad as child abuse except no
one thinks so because theyre not
cute Everyone hates old people in
this culture thank you very much
Not like Native Americans who
worship old people Except for the
Eskimos who kill them by sending
them off to die on ice bergs
Which soon they wont be able to do
anymore because theyre all
disappearing Thanks to global
warming thank you very much

FRANCISS FATHER
Your moms right Think about it

FRANCIS
Its not the Alzheimers familys
fault This country doesnt
provide any affordable assistance
for people of need in situations of
crisis Thank your congressman

FRANCISS FATHER
Francis youre a thoughtful man

FRANCISS MOTHER
We raised him right I made a
plate Its by the stove

FRANCIS
(grabbing plate)
Donna Serapilia won best
supporting You dont have a take-
out container Its snowing Ma

FRANCISS MOTHER

FRANCIS
Ill take a Mernz The Rain and
the Wind is going to sweep Its
an outrage

FRANCISS MOTHER
(handing him beer)
I heard the rain movie was good
Vivian saw it and --

FRANCIS
Fuck Vivian If by good she means
bad then yes Its sentimental
tripe and steals blatantly from the
work of Cavanaugh

FRANCISS MOTHER
What should win then

FRANCIS
What should win this year has not
been made Mom JI should win for
the movie I would make given half
a chance If there was any real
integrity to this award show they
would cancel it Its another
vacuous mediocre profit-driven
racist year The last valid best
picture was Hodgsons The Parallel
Lines of Katie Wolf in 1972

FRANCISS FATHER
Ive never even heard of that

FRANCIS
Exactly Brutally honest formally
rigorous searing character study
of a young womans descent into
hebephrenic schizophrenia Why
should you have heard of it Oh
no reason just the last great
American movie of the 20th century

FRANCISS MOTHER
I dont like movies about
hebephrenic schizophrenia I saw
that other hebephrenic movie --
What was it Wilbur I know
its an important subject as the
stigma against mental illness needs
to be lifted but I go to a movie
to be entertained Im sorry

(CONTTNURFD )

FRANCIS

(zipping up)
Its a comedy Mom People dont
realize that its hysterically
funny But if you follow what
Hodgson is doing it is the most
laugh-out-loud brilliantly satiric
movie youll ever see Brutally
moving too A masterpiece of
brutally moving comedy Thanks for
the grub

FRANK
Um thank you to the Academy --

FRANCIS

(agitated)
Frank Arder is an interesting case
Hes what I call the darling of the
pseudo-intellectual hipster twee
pretentious over-educated elitist
crowd His movies allow dumb
people to feel smart but the
acclaim he receives is entirely
unjustified Anyone who has any
background in film history knows
that Praxis is just a massively
inferior retread of Montgomery
Kellers 1971 masterpiece The
Spasm Merchant

(CONTTNURFD )

Francis pulls a DVD of The Spasm Merchant from his
collection and waves it as proof He peruses the most recent
additions to the live Oscar conversation on his computer
Several posters are glad Arder won Francis types Arder is
a pretentious unoriginal minor showman Your emperor has
no clothes folks His statement is followed by a flurry of
rebukes and people calling Francis names On the TV the
audience applauds into commercial as Frank is led off

Something big has happened on the monitors and nobody is
paying attention to Frank anymore A lot of the reporters
are screaming What won What won What won

INT FRANCISS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

seeing something thats not there
I thought I was Skinny Dad in this

reasonable person And I can admit
to being wrong Am I wrong Is

you why because this movie is not

Jonathan talks to Richards Head

equipment in the background

RICHARDS HEAD
Ive taken the liberty of reading
fifteen screenwriting manuals to
familiarize myself with the form

JOANTHAN WALLER
Good

RICHARDS HEAD
So what I need from you now is a
logline Do you know that term

JONATHAN WALLER
Of course The future Earth is
overcrowded A ship is sent into
deep space to find a habitable
planet While surveying one
possible planet they spot a
mountain range that looks very much
like a man Upon closer inspection
they see it is an actual humanoid
on his back He is five miles
long Turns out its God and hes
sick and dying This is why there
is so much strife on Earth The
astronauts have to fly their space
ship inside God and try to save him
in order to save the universe

RICHARDS HEAD
This is a tough one Just off the
top of my head its going to have
to take both a theistic and an
atheistic point of view The
physical interpretation of God will
have to conform to all religions
including ones that do not allow a
physical manifestation of Him Her
It or Them

Richard tinkers on some

(CONTTNURFD )

JONATHAN WALLER
It sounds impossible

RICHARDS HEAD
It is But Richards Head makes
the impossible possible Thats my
motto

JONATHAN
Why would you have a motto

RICHARDS HEAD

game

JONATHAN WALLER
Youre an animatronic head

INT MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Francis sits next to Mimi in the crowded theater

On screen

Frank Arder dressed as a homeless man dances gracefully on

a street corner to music passers-by dont hear

A disdainful

Francis looks over at Mimi Her eyes glisten with tears

Later The movie is over Frank in the front of the house
with a moderator and microphones Aq and a is in progress
Mimis charmed Francis glancing over at her is angry

AUDIENCE MEMBER
I think I speak for every single
person here tonight when I say
Thank You for this movie for being
so honest and vulnerable and brave
My life has been changed by this
movie and I feel certain that every
single person here feels exactly
the same about this movie

FRANK
Oh thanks Thank you

Hands shoot up in the audience Franciss included

MODERATOR
(pointing at Francis)
Yes The man in the yellow shirt

FRANCIS
(voice shaking)
Thank you
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

FRANCIS (CONTD)
I want to ask you how you can
justify blatantly shamelessly
stealing so heavily from the works
of vastly superior artists such
as but not limited to Ortega and
the Spanish Rectangulists the Neo-
Pragmatists McKelman Abernathy
The Parentheticalists I could go
on

Mimi is mortified She leans away from Francis

FRANK
Um ok please do

FRANCIS

(gaining confidence)
Yeah You wanna tangle Fine
Youve taken the work of these
great thinkers and somehow
transformed it into the whining
angsty screed of a teenaged girl
Your understanding of the
philosophical writings of Flunt
for example is laughably shallow
The entire film is a panoply of
facile show-offy references to the
works of your betters and as such
I find it offensive and I would
like you to give me my two hours
back thank you very much

FRANK
I just want to say I feel
privileged to be able to give
necessary cinematic voice to the
whiny angst of teenage girls
The audience laughs Mimi is in love Francis seethes
EXT STREET - NIGHT

Mimi walks fast Francis keeps up

FRANCIS
Should we get coffee

MIMI

FRANCIS
Did I do something wrong
MIMI
Its -- no Francis
Silence
FRANCIS

Okay here goes Mimi Randy only
likes you because I like you I
liked you first and I made the
mistake of telling him Hes a
copycat And hes very competitive
with me Its an illness you
shouldnt hate him for it I just
want you to know because I care
about you Even though it might
make you think Im lying to hear
the truth about Randy because you
need to protect the fantasy world
youre in Im willing to take
that chance Because I care about
you so much Im willing to risk my
chance of something more beautiful
than friendship with you

INT MULTIPLEX MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Full theater watches test screening of Alan Modell in Skinny
Dad Modell and a cluster of execs are in the back

On the screen The Emcee thin and handsome is in the midst
of an antic routine running around trying to keep a few
toddlers safe from various household calamities

The audience is quiet There are a few nervous giggles and
some coughing The Emcee and the studio execs seem stressed

Later Lights up The audience except for people in the
first few rows is gone The Emcee and execs still sit in
the back A charismatic man stands before the focus group

MANAGER

CHARISMATIC MAN
So what did you guys think
Brigham

BRIGHAM
Why wasnt he fat

CHARISMATIC MAN
Why wasnt Fat Dad fat Sarah
Beth

SARAH BETH
Its called Skinny Dad Remember
the whole eating healthy and
exercising at the beginning
People are health-conscious
nowadays So thats how he lost
weight by being health conscious
It reflects our society And our
concerns about health consciousness
and eating fruits

BRIGHAM
Yo I remember that What Im
asking is like why the director
made the fat guy not fat in this
movie when the fat part was the
funny part of the other movie that
this is the sequel of

CHARISMATIC MAN

Neil
NEIL
I agree with Gribbin
BRIGHAM
Brigham
NEIL

Whatever dude The guy was so fat

in the last one he couldnt get

through the revolving door

Remember And if someone threw

something at him it would bounce

off him like he was made of rubber
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

NEIL (CONTD)
With a rubber sound Remember
That was funny No one even
bothers throwing anything at him in
this one And if you ask me I
think its because it wouldnt be
funny because the dudes skinny and
it wouldnt even make a rubber
sound

EMCEE
All the sounds not even in yet

MANAGER
Thatll make all the difference

EMCEE
We could still add rubber sounds

INT HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

We still need to get proper
translations of everything else

JONATHAN WALLER
Hows it going so far

RICHARDS HEAD
Quite well Jonathan For people
who think you have no depth Ive
added depth For people who think
youre arrogant Ive added
humility There are those who
think positively of your arrogance
and call it confidence For them
Ive removed humility

JONATHAN
Isnt that a contradiction

RICHARDS HEAD
Oh yes For people who thought you
are racist by always having white
people save the day I have made
the hero black

This is a Monterrand Middle

period Id say around 1870-72

They arrive at the painting Francis looks at the card

(CONTTNURFD )

Marie tries to follow his directions

FRANCIS (CONTD)
Bingo 71 At this point
Monterrand was suffering from
phlebitis and had been recently
abandoned by Claudine Pallas
leaving him distraught If you
study the painting properly you can
see the tension between the
positive and negative space and how
he rebels against the de rigueur
use of pigmentary enallage to
create exasperation and grief

MARIA
Oh Uh-huh

FRANCIS
So what you do is start here upper
right Then let your eyes drift
slowly down at a diagonal to lower
left then without lingering back
up to center Quickly Quickly
Then midlevel left and then all
the way right Finally circle the
perimeter and back to center
And rest

they swivel all about

INT FRANCISS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Later Frank sits in the front of the house with the other
woman and answers questions from the audience

MAN IN BLUE
I think its racist And I want my
two hours back And I want to
point out that I love all your
other work which makes my hating
this film much more significant in
that I come from a place of being
your biggest fan so my hatred of
this film tells you how bad it must
really be

INT HOTEL SUITE - MORNING

Frank talks with a hip journalist in high-tops

(CONTTNURFD )

HIP JOURNALIST
In addition to the inherent racism
in your film thereve been charges
of plagiarism leveled against you
Your response

FRANK
Whos leveling those charges and
what am I supposed to have
plagiarized

HIP JOURNALIST
Ive seen it online
(consulting notes)
Charges youve stolen from
McKelman Abernathy Delva
Entwhistle Breierstein Helmond
LeBeau List goes on

FRANK
Im only marginally aware of the
work of a few of those people I
havent heard of the rest

HIP JOURNALIST
Its not so much a word-for-word
plagiarism that the critics are
charging as it is pilfering ideas
and presenting them as your own
And the people who raise these
concerns feel that this issue is
compounded by your shallow and
facile understanding of the ideas
youve stolen

FRANK
Allegedly stolen

HIP JOURNALIST
So you acknowledge that you
allegedly stole these ideas

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Frank is up front answering audience questions

MAN IN AUDIENCE
This is a two part question First
is it ethical to steal so heavily
from great filmmakers without
giving attribution

(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

MAN IN AUDIENCE (CONTD)
And how do you justify stealing so
heavily from great filmmakers of
whom you acknowledge having only a
glancing awareness of and
therefore presumably a very
limited understanding of of

(CONTTNURFD )

Frank hangs up He takes a swig of wine and looks on his
computer at Francis247s last post He paces makes a
decision and types a response

FRANK (CONTD)

Francis247 --

(singing)
You have a mean tongueand you seem
very youngso perhaps you need time
to matureBut calling folks names
for liking a film is not what these
forums are forMaybe some day your
viewpoint will shiftwhich might
happen with wisdom and ageUntil
that time comesplease refrain
frompolluting this page with your
rage

INT FRANCISS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Francis checks the message boards sees Franks entry which
is from ArderFan82 begins to type a response and sings

I have no ragebut mere
curiosityhow can anyoneenjoy this

pretentiousprescriptiveand fueled
by pomposity

INT THEATER - DAY
Frank sits in the front with a moderator
WOMAN IN AUDIENCE

Isnt it the height of arrogance
or perhaps a better word would be
Pomposity to present your
entertainment as a prescriptive for
Americas social ills

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Frank drinks types angrily and sings

(CONTTNURFD )

FRANK
You lurk in these
websitessearching for fist
fightsbecause youre invisible
unsung and miserableAnd your only
chance at a semblance of fameis by
showing off putting downand
calling us names

FRANCIS (0S)
I am not insulting youbut simply
expressing a point of viewThe
movie is lame pretentious
ineptWhat about that cannot you
accept

We move into split screen

FRANK
I found it moving profound and
deep

FRANCIS

No you did notYoure a lame
hipster sheepThis films for dumb
peopleto make them feel smart

FRANK
This films about lifeThis movie
is art

FRANCIS

You embarrass yourself with your
limited knowledgeBully for you
you attend junior college

FRANK
Are you really so threatened by
others success

FRANCIS
If You is successful I couldnt
care less

FRANK (SPOKEN)
All right Francis you want to
talk about You Lets talk about
you

(thinking)

Youre too old to be living with
your parents but you do

(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

Francis sits there speechless morose ruined

FRANK (SPOKEN) (CONTD)
You may pretend its your own place
because its got a separate
entrance or its over the garage
but you live with your parents
Maybe you have a girlfriend but
you dont like her much In fact
you are hostile to her because she
is not the girl you love the one
you should have the one who wont
have anything to do with you
because she sees your sickness
You have a menial job you sell
shirts or answer phones You think
youre too good for this job You
feel youre destined for greatness
Youre going to be a great
filmmaker or an intellectual film
critic but you never make any move
in that direction because youre
so crippled with anxiety about
putting anything concrete into the
world believing it will be deemed
mediocre or insignificant or not
noticed at all and that would
confirm your secret true belief
that youre not special You are
not loved You are not adored
Your parents wanted you to be an
impressive reflection of them
They wanted you to be brighter and
more attractive They wanted you
to be a hero So Francis what
you do is attack others the way you
feel you would be attacked if you
let your guard down Its sad
Its tragic but this is the way
you will lead your life
Provocation throws people off your
real scent and perhaps it is the
only way you can get people to
notice you at all

at his computer No response

know is your favorite cake
Aloysius because I am your God

The Emcee sits in a packed theater with Magda and watches
Proteus Everyone wears 3-D glasses The thumbs hover on
either side of the Emcees head Others in the audience do
not appear to see them On screen we see a lush underwater
environment full of colorful plants and fish Proteus a
pale shimmery-skinned giant of man swims toward us

PROTEUS
It is here in the dark in the
secret hidden world that the
truth of our being is finally
understood Fish do not need
words They are words

silent then bursts into rapturous applause

endless profundity in the
pretentious pap we correctly
abhorred last week You will
become a massive critical and
commercial hit as gullible
audiences flock to see a movie
cynical marketers have finally
figured out a viable campaign for
See itll turn out we were too
hasty in our dismissal of this
masterpiece by this poor man for
whom the world was not ready Now
that he died for our sins we will
give him the respect we couldnt
earlier Well I call bullshit and
state firmly and for the record
that Im glad that Frank Arder is
dead Now we will no longer have
to be subjected to his pretentious
derivative solipsistic feebly
crafted celluloid ramblings The
world is a less cluttered and more
beautiful place I am sorry all
those other people on that plane
had to die for this to happen but
it was a noble and worthy sacrifice
and I honor them for making it I
furthermore predict that I will be
crucified for stating this truth
But that is fine

EXT MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Marquee reads God A long line of excited fans waiting to
All different types of people kids old people all
different races and ethnicities

get in

INT MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

God is in progress

On screen is a weird vibrating

pulsating sometimes murky sometimes vibrantly colored

conglomeration of images

There are voices fading in and

out in many different languages tribal percussion fused

with the Slendro scale

Each member of the audience is

completely engaged in his or her own way some people are
laughing some are crying some are talking back to the
screen some seem terrified some are nodding knowingly

INT TV STUDIO - DAY

Jonathan is interviewed by PBS-style guy

PBS GUY
So the genesis of this amazing
piece of work How did you make a
movie that is so universally
acclaimed There seems to be
nobody who doesnt think its the
best movie ever made To date its
made seven billion dollars

JONATHAN
Nine billion

PBS GUY
Nine billion And there doesnt
seem to be an end in sight

JONATHAN
Well I wanted to create a story-
telling technology equivalent to
the technology I created for
animation with Hiroshima So
with the help of my brother
Richard a computer scientist I
created An AI screenwriting program
which worked in conjunction with an
animatronic computerized head --

PBS GUY

Wait so the story -- which is
marvelous I mean its my story --
was written by a robotic head

(CONTTNURFD )

JONATHAN
In a manner of speaking you see --

PBS GUY
Wait Can we talk to the head
Id love to interview that head I
think that would be marvelous

JONATHAN
(pause)

MONTAGE

We see a series of different enraptured people watching this
interview on various TVs in various locations The words
that Richards Head uses in each segment seem to directly
address the person watching For example if its a
conservative-looking rural guy Richards Head might be
saying Christian if its a bunch of drunk frat guys

Richards Head might be saying Babes in wet T-shirts The
sequence ends with a shot of Francis as Richards Head says
Spanish Rectangulists Francis nods his head

enthusiastically

they comment online about it as they watch in other case
they laugh with their friends People in Romania stand in
front of their TVs and sing along

delivers the final thought of the anthem

EMCEE
Wed rather die in battle in
elevated gloryThan live again
enslaved in our ancestral land

The Audience is laughing uproariously as they applaud and
give the Emcee a standing ovation Some think this was a gag
and others believe the Emcee to be insane but all are
thrilled with the performance

KEVIN JAMES

sentiment Thank you I do think

INT OVAL OFFICE - DAY
We fade in on Richards Head addressing the American people

RICHARDS HEAD
As I near the end of my second
term as America finds itself in an
unprecedented era of peace and
prosperity I am reminded of the
writing of a young man named
Francis Deems

As Richards Head continues we drift through Franciss
dusty long-empty apartment through his Hollywood hotel room
now occupied by others across barren plains past radio
towers We see not a soul The wind blows

RICHARDS HEAD (CONTD)
Once a tireless voice on the
internet Deems has been silent for
years now and we as a people are
poorer for it He brought passion
and anger jealousy hurt
bitterness ambition hopelessness
and the desperate sadness of the
unheard to our national
consciousness He reminded us of
our fragility I miss him and hope
to hear from him again someday As
I hope to continue to hear from all
of you
