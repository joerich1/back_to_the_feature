FADE IN
EXT MARSHLAND - DUSK
We move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass
fire Dirt is thrown over the flames before a BOOT finishes
stamping them out
SUPER PLAINFIELD WISCONSIN 1944
HENRY GEIN (0S)
Were just lucky it didnt reach the
trees
We move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find HENRY and ED
GEIN sweating away as they continue shovelling out the
flames Both are in their forties and wearing flannel
shirts

Ed wears an Elmer Fudd hat

HENRY GEIN (CONTD)

Theres gonna be a lot more jobs at that
factory by Milwaukee come June I could
put in a word

ED GEIN
You cant leave us Henry She needs both
OF US--

HENRY GEIN
Can you stop being a mommas boy for one
second
and

on

Henry looks at Ed and he shrinks back

HENRY GEIN (CONTD)

Im not trying to hurt you but Jesus you

got to live your own life someday That

woman can take care of her own goddamn --
CLANG Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head

goes down

Ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel The look

his face isnt anger Its BLANK He pulls at the flaps of
his Elmer Fudd hat then calmly walks away

The camera pans until we discover
ALFRED HITCHCOCK

in his trademark black Mariani suit Hes been watching the
whole thing standing in the smouldering field only a few
feet away holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea

He takes a sip and turns to address the camera --

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Good evening

He places his cup daintily back on the saucer

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Brother has been slaying brother since
Cain and Abel yet even I did not see
that coming I was as blind-sided as poor
Henry over there

He glances back over at the murder scene

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Apparently the authorities shared my
naivete and believed the young mans tale
that Henry fell and hit his head ona
stone and died of smoke asphyxiation

He shrugs “Who wouldve thought it
with

length

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Of course if they hadnt believed him Ed
never would have had the opportunity to
commit the heinous acts for which he
became famous and we wouldnt have our
little movie Instead wed have more
nice safe predictable ones like
these

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Mere Technicolor baubles

He shudders with distaste As if on cue the sky THUNDERS
LOUDLY above him He looks up and from behind the tree stump
produces an umbrella

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Ah A bit of doom and gloom Now thats
more like it

ALFRED AND ALMA HITCHCOCK

Step out into a sea of FLASHBULBS Hitch basks in the
limelight while Alma his razor-sharp charming wife of over
30 years stands in the background uncomfortable with all

the
attention
Hitchcocks agent LEW WASSERMAN 45 dynamic charismatic
comes into view
LEW WASSERMAN
This thing is going to be gigantic I
wish I had twenty percent of the take
Lew hustles them through the throng of REPORTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS under their BLACK UMBRELLAS
REPORTER ONE
Does tonights incredible reaction
surprise you Mr Hitchcock
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
No when I was planning North by
Northwest I could already hear the
screams and laughter
(then to a BEAUTIFUL
BLONDE FAN)
Any questions my dear
The blonde fan holding out her autograph book shakes her
head ‘no and giggles
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
A pity

The reporters crack up Alma manages a polite smile as Lew
helps her into the limo leaving Hitchcock alone for a
moment

to sign his autograph for the blond fan

REPORTER TWO

into

Mr Hitchcock youve directed forty-six
motion pictures You host a hit TV show
seen around the world Youre the most
famous director in the history of the

medium but youre sixty years old
Shouldnt you just quit while youre
ahead

HOLDING ON HITCHCOCK

motionless and quietly devastated as FLASHBULBS CRACKLE over
his face The whiteness transforms into

INT THE HITCHCOCKS BEL AIR HOME - BATHROOM - MORNING

THE GLEAMING WHITE TILES of a bathroom We move past chrome
fixtures that evoke those in Spellbound and Psycho and

at that same pudgy hand pouring CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC 53
a cut crystal glass
HITCHCOCK

soaks in the tub The champagne glass beside him his
corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times hes
reading Even in this deeply vulnerable state he maintains
the air of a haughty mischievous emperor

At the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened Hitchs eyes
shift to the FULL-LENGTH MIRROR on the bathroom door

IN THE MIRROR

We catch fleeting glimpses of Alma in a white half-slip and
matching bra She takes out some NYLONS and holds them up to
the light

Hitchcock watches enthralled He puts down his glass and
shifts a little in the tub causing the water to lap against
the sides

BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Alma pauses when she hears the small splashes Neither upset
nor amused she continues about her business taking a skirt
from the drawer

on

ALMA
Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms
gouged out with arrows

Hitchcock clears his throat rattling his paper as if hed
been reading the whole time

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Talking of arrows did you read Mr
Weilers review in the New York Times
Apparently he found the climax to be --
and I quote -- overdrawn

ALMA
I doubt whether Mr Weiler has had a
climax in years

Alma steps into her skirt as Hitch opens the London Times

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
And how about this little grenade
(READING)
North by Northwest reminds us of
Hitchcocks earlier more youthfully
inventive spy thrillers
(BEAT)
And just to drive the nail into the
coffin theres a handy accompanying
guide to the new masters of suspense

Hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs Theyre all young
Thinner And with hair

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Why do they keep looking for new masters
of suspense when they still have the
original

ALMA
Dont be maudlin you know how much it
aggravates me

He catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks
further down into the water to hide his protruding belly

Alma comes in takes the newspapers from him and puts them

the side
ALMA (CONTD)
Stop reading them Youve been reading
them for a week now

She puts down the TOILET SEAT and sits on it

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Tell me dear Am I really too old

ALMA
Yes A true relic And lest we forget a
notably corpulent one

She comes over and kisses the top of his head

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
You always know precisely where to plunge
the dagger dont you

ALMA
Right between the shoulder blades I
learned it from your pictures

She moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and Hitchcock
surreptitiously picks up the papers again

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Where are you off to

ALMA
Im seeing Whit for brunch after I drop
you off at the studio Why dont you join
us

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Weve just established that Im too
corpulent to be seen in broad daylight

ALMA
Youll feel better as soon as you finda
project Hasnt Peggy unearthed any
decent books yet

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Sleeping pills with dust jackets

Alma steps back to inspect herself in the full-length

Todays outfit is we sense rather more stylish than what
she would ordinarily wear

ALMA
Well

Hitchs gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger
rivals in the “New Masters of Suspense article

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Very presentable

ON ALMA
As she elegantly masks her hurt

ALMA
Hurry up darling Youre pruning

She leaves Hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside He
rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and
grabs onto the SHOWER CURTAIN wrenching it from the METAL
RINGS on the rod

A GODS EYE view looking down as Hitchcock stares up at
metal rings SPINNING NOISILY on the metal rod

ALMA
Theres a story out there waiting for you

He gives her a good-bye peck and opens the door

ALMA (CONTD)

Alma hands him a compact Fortnum and Mason basket and pats him
on his girth He opens it to discover CELERY AND CARROT
STICKS wrapped in Saran

Luxurious wood-paneled and very British Hitch sits
restlessly behind his desk receiving his morning shave from
his private barber SILVIO His longtime assistant PEGGY
ROBERTSON 40s crisp British fiercely protective of her
boss is going through a list of potential projects

PEGGY
Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne
Frank for the third time

Hitch directs his response to Silvio

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
The audience would spend the entire
picture waiting for Miss Frank to
discover the corpse Id hidden in the
attic Wouldnt you agree Silvio

SILVIO
Si
Hitch reaches for a carrot stick and CRUNCHES it
PEGGY

Doesnt she know I just made that movie
Its called North by Northwest And
style is merely self-plagiarism

Silvio nods then recommences the shave

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Im treading water Peggy I need
something fresh Something different
Without expensive stars like Cary Grant
or Miss Kim Novak to pretty it up

Silvio unintentionally nicks Hitchs face

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
A nice clean nasty little piece of
work

Silvio hurriedly dabs away a speck of BLOOD

PEGGY
Ill see what I can find

Hitch motions for the barber to hold up the mirror The

of his face overflows the small frame Repulsed he leans
back his head and makes a hand motion for Silvio to SLIT HIS
THROAT

CONTAGIOUS LAUGHTER (PRE-LAP)
INT CHASENS RESTAURANT - DAY

Alma lunches with screenwriter-novelist WHITFIELD COOK
WHIT 50s is Hitchcocks physical opposite -- dashing
razor-sharp and sophisticated In fact hed be at home in

of his movies

WHITFIELD COOK
Thank God I had a pocketful of
pretzels I was hiding in that props
cupboard all night
(THEN)
Thatll teach me to use a bedroom set
by

instead of the real thing

ALMA
Serves you right

They laugh uproariously quite at ease with each other

ALMA (CONTD)
Hitch always said your private life was
in danger of being more entertaining than
any of your plots

He pours Alma another glass of wine not remotely insulted

WHITFIELD COOK
I cant believe he let me have you all to
myself for a whole afternoon Especially
looking this beautiful

He clinks her glass

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)
Trés chic

Alma turns to look at the menu again

ALMA
All this relentless sycophancy is giving
me indigestion

(MORE)

ALMA (CONTD)
(A SMILE)
What are you after

He laughs his eyes straying to a PRETTY WAITRESS passing
Alma notices

ALMA (CONTD)
And how is your wife

WHITFIELD COOK
Elizabeth
(his eyes return to Alma)
Over the moon since I promised her the
dedication in my new novel So what are
you working on these days
ALMA
Hitch is going out of his mind looking
for his next project You know how
unbearable he is when he doesnt have
something lined up

WHITFIELD COOK
Almost as unbearable as when he does

ALMA
(LAUGHING)
Almost

WHITFIELD COOK
I meant you What are you working on

ALMA
Im satisfied spending time in my garden

WHITFIELD COOK
That is one lucky garden

Whit brings out a set of galleys and slides them across the
tablecloth to her

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)

Actually I was hoping you might be able
to apply your considerable pruning skills
to this

She looks down and reads the cover page Taxi to Dubrovnik
By Whitfield Cook

ALMA
Ah All is finally revealed

He touches her hand affectionately She brushes it away
affectionately

WHITFIELD COOK
The most fun I ever had was working with

you

She looks through the opening pages taking her time
enjoying making him wait

ALMA
I suppose I could give it a look

INT HITCHCOCKS OFFICE PARAMOUNT - DAY

Hitchcock peeks avidly through the blinds at a smartly
dressed KIM NOVAK-TYPE WOMAN hurrying along to some
appointment or assignation Hitch cranes to see who shes
meeting but she moves tantalizingly out of sight

Hitch turns back with a sigh towards his desk covered with
discarded newspaper clippings and boring story proposals

He sweeps them off his desk into the trash
INT HITCHCOCKS OUTER OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

A SHADOW looms over Peggy at her desk as she sifts through
another round of story ideas Its Hitchcock He startles
her

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Anything Anything at all

He starts sifting through her tray She notices the glass in
his hand

PEGGY
Nothing suitable Is that water or do I
need to call Alma

He drains it playfully

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Gin Mothers ruin

But somethings caught his eye A circled review of Anthony
Bouchers column CRIMINAL MINDS in the New York Times
Review of Books He picks it up

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Boucher says this Psycho book by Robert
Bloch is ‘fiendishly entertaining’

PEGGY
It sounds ghastly Everyone in towns
already passed

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
And who is everyone

PEGGY
The story department finished the
coverage this morning

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Is this the one based on Ed Gein the
serial killer

He takes the coverage and reads for himself

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Graphic elements of brutal violence

voyeurism transvestitism and incest
Certainly not your average run of the

mill nutcase is he

He gives a grunt of approval

PEGGY
Youre kidding

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Peggy This is the boy who dug up his own
mother

INT HITCHCOCKS STUDY - THE NEXT NIGHT
ON HITCH

Completely engrossed as he sits reading Psycho in a chair
by the fire of his elegant Bel Air home He takes another
gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine
glass out of view Alma pops her head in the door

ALMA
Hungry

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Famished

She disappears to take off her coat

ALMA (0S)
If youre good maybe you can have a
grapefruit later

She comes back in again carrying some galleys notices the
title of Hitchs book -- some trash called Psycho

ALMA (CONTD)
Whit gave me the galleys of his new book
yesterday at lunch Ive already got some
ideas on how you could adapt it
Hitch continues reading
ALMA (CONTD)

Its elegant sophisticated full of
INTRIGUE --

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
The book or Mr Whitfield Cook

She taps Hitchs book dismissively with the galleys of Taxi
to Dubrovnik

ALMA
This might be the one Alfred

He finally looks up

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Leave it on the night stand

As she leaves she points to Hitchs “hidden wine glass

ALMA
There are calories in that you know

But Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window his
imagination starting to turn

INT GEIN HOUSE PLAINVIEW 1945 - NIGHT

Ed enters the bedroom His mother Augusta is in the bed
faced away from him

ED GEIN
Arent you cold ma

She doesnt answer We follow him to the dresser where he
lingers a little too long over his mothers open underwear
and

on

drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side

He comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her Still
wearing his jacket he takes off his shoes gets into bed

crawls up next to her

ED GEIN (CONTD)
Dont be afraid ma Im here

As he puts his arm around her and pulls her close we reveal
his mothers ghoulishly embalmed face

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

A slant of moonlight finds Alma fast asleep until a FINGER
nudges her awake She lifts her satin sleep mask to see
Hitchcock holding out his copy of Psycho

ALMA
Oh God

The look of obsession on his face is unmistakable

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Read the bit in the motel bathroom

ALMA
Now

He switches on the light by her bedside She sits up puts
her glasses and reads from the opened page

ALMA (CONTD)
Mary started to scream and then the
curtains parted further and a hand
appeared holding a butchers knife It
was the knife that a moment later cut
off her scream and her head
(handing him back the book)
Charming Doris Day should do it asa
musical

She hands him back the book
ALMA (CONTD)
This is nothing but low-budget horror
movie claptrap

She turns off the light again and goes back to bed A deep
voice sounds from the darkness

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
But what if someone really good made a
horror movie

EXT HITCHCOCKS GARDEN - MORNING

The Hitchcocks eat breakfast on the terrace watching the
GARDENERS trim the bushes and rake leaves from the pool

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Just think of the shock value Killing
off your leading lady halfway through

Alma can feel Hitch looking at her waiting for a response
Clearly he isnt going to let this one go

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Youre intrigued Admit it

She butters her toast casually taunts him by adding a large
spoon of marmalade

ALMA
Actually I think its a huge mistake

Hitch falls silent a chastised schoolboy
ALMA (CONTD)

You shouldnt wait till halfway

through Kill her off after 30 minutes
OMITTED (SCENE 17)

INT HITCHCOCKS OFFICE PARAMOUNT - DAY

Hitch enters with purpose carrying a stack of photos and
articles

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Peggy I want you to summon your

minions

PEGGY
Minions Certainly And who might they
be

Hitch heads for his office in no mood for wise cracks He
spreads out the articles on the desk Photos and magazine
articles about Ed Gein

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Get them started buying copies of
Psycho

Peggy stands in the doorway watching --

PEGGY
How many do you need

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
All of them I want every copy
nationwide

(MORE)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Have them scour every book shop and
library Psycho is my next picture and
I dont want anyone to find out the
ending until they see it in the theater

Peggy shakes her head

PEGGY
All that celerys affecting your brain

She walks over notices the LIFE MAGAZINE headline HOUSE
OF HORRORS STUNS NATION Stark black and white photographs
expose the nightmarish decay of the Gein house

PEGGY (CONTD)
Are you sure about this This is so
unlike you

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Thats exactly the point my dear

Peggy watches uneasily as Hitchcock pores over the articles
with delight
saying

CLOSE ON A MANILA ENVELOPE clutched in one hand behind
HITCHCOCKS back as we follow him travel through the party
The clink of champagne glasses as we reveal the GUESTS

HELLO as he passes

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP)
And when the Wisconsin Police department
raided his farmhouse in Plainview

HITCHCOCK

Is now in position in front of the fire place Around the
coffee table are INVITED GOSSIP COLUMNISTS including a

HOPPER-TYPE They take in the gory LIFE MAGAZINE article

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) (CONTD)
they opened the door only to discover -
voila

He produces the manila envelope from behind his back and
empties THE HORRIFICALLY GORY CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS inside
onto the coffee table

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Ten female heads with the tops sawn
off a dozen masks of human skin and a
pair of lips on a drawstring for a window
shade

Hitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified
expressions

HEDDA HOPPER TYPE
Is this really going to be youre next
picture Mr Hitchcock

HITCHCOCK
That is my intention madam Yes
Hitch taps the photo of ED GEIN

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I only wish he looked more like William
Holden and less like Elmer Fudd

The other columnists scribble down the quote

HEDDA HOPPER TYPE

Am I the only one who finds this
offensive

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I was hoping everyone would I mean life

is deeply offensive and disgusting isnt
it

Hitch glides off without missing a beat past the Servers
arriving with more hors doeuvres from the kitchen

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Try the finger sandwiches -- theyre real
fingers

He snags a martini and collars Peggy while hes at it

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Peggy Im going to need some research

detailing a typical unmarried 30-year-old
secretary from Phoenix Arizona

He looks over at the pantry

where Alma can be glimpsed
through the swinging door

putting food onto trays

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Her monthly rent what she wears what

she reads which scent or perfume she
prefers

Hitch sees WHIT lean into view and innocently whisper
something into Almas ear making her laugh

PEGGY
How she deals with a demanding boss
when shes trying to relax on her
weekends off

Hitchcock doesnt notice the joke He now only has eyes on
the pantry ahead

He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew
It is a classic Hitchcock moment a character needing to get
someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat --

LEW WASSERMAN
(re the faces of the

GOSSIP COLUMNISTS)
I told you Hitch This things strictly
for the drive-in crowd

Hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself heading on to
the kitchen through more annoying guests --

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE PANTRY - SIMULTANEOUS

Whit leans against the stove watching Alma expertly arrange
the next round of hors doeuvres coming in from the kitchen

WHITFIELD COOK
Now if this were a Hitchcock picture
what would two characters like us
married to other people be saying

ALMA
You dont have to pretend youre not
upset he hasnt read it yet you know

WHITFIELD COOK
Im a big boy I can take it

ALMA
Well I loved it What terrific fun it
must have been to research

WHITFIELD COOK
Certainly more fun than reading those
reviews

(MORE)

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)
(THEN)
Do you think he really will read it

Suddenly over Whitfields shoulder Alma sees Hitch looming
in

in the doorway Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and
turns

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)
Speak of the devil

Hitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies
herself over the sink hiding an almost imperceptible blush

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)

I have to admit Hitch I ran all over
town looking for a copy of Psycho but
couldnt find a single one

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I wonder how that could have happened

Hitch sips his martini a picture of innocence Then leans

to Whits ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into
Almas ear a moment earlier

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Dont stop looking on my behalf

Peggy appears in the pass-through beckoning Hitch to hurry
back into the living room

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hitch returns to see the other GUESTS are now passing around
the GEIN PHOTOS They look utterly confused and horrified
a couple of them are even gathering their coats

ON LEW PEGGY AND HITCH
standing together watching

LEW WASSERMAN
Ive seen happier faces on a school bus
going over a cliff

PEGGY
I told you it would be too much

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
But they cant stop looking can they

He slurps his martini sharing a smile with Lew
INT PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM - DAY

Paramount President BARNEY BALABAN 70s ferocious
righteous sits behind his impressive desk flanked by two
CONSERVATIVELY-ATTIRED EXECUTIVES

Hitchcock and Wasserman sit across from them

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Audiences want to be shocked Barney
They want something different And this
is it

He gestures to the untouched copy of Psycho in front of
Balaban

BARNEY BALABAN
The truth is Hitch every time you want
to do something different like The
Wrong Man or Vertigo someone loses
money

Hitchcock stares unblinking giving nothing away

LEW WASSERMAN
So we should stop trying to give them
something new

BARNEY BALABAN
You owe Paramount one last picture
Hitch Cant you do something like North
by Northwest but for us this time instead
of for MGM

Hitchs stare remains inscrutable

BARNEY BALABAN (CONTD)
Weve offered you dozens of perfectly
good properties

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
(IMPERIOUSLY)
Psycho

Wasserman gives Balaban the same glacial stare The
Paramount
executives shift uncomfortably

BARNEY BALABAN
No one respects the name Hitchcock more
than Paramount But even a talented man
sometimes backs the wrong horse

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Are you telling me no

Balaban maintains a calm pleasant front

BARNEY BALABAN
I think you know me better than that
Hitch I would never say no to you

Hitchs suppressed rage is buildingbut Balaban says
nothing

EXT PARAMOUNT COURTYARD - DAY

Hitch and Lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy
courtyard past Hitchs office

LEW WASSERMAN
What a putz You know what his family did
before they built those movie palaces
Ran a grocery store

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
My father ran a grocery store

LEW WASSERMAN
Exactly Thats what Im saying He
should show some respect

Hitch turns to Lew

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
They think Ive lost my touch Lew
My association with television has
cheapened me

LEW WASSERMAN
Are you referring to that deal I got you
where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine
grand an episode and you own the
negative Thats my kind of cheap

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
They just want the same thing over and
over Theyve put me in a coffin and now
theyre nailing down the lid
Lew puts a comforting hand on him

LEW WASSERMAN
Hitch I will never let that happen

Hitch doesnt respond Lew sensing the true depth of his
friends melancholy

LEW WASSERMAN (CONTD)
How much do you think you can make this
picture for

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Eight hundred thousand Give or take

Lew digests the figure

LEW WASSERMAN
I have whisky in the car

EXT HITCHCOCK HOUSE SWIMMING POOL - A FEW DAYS LATER

ALMA does afternoon laps in the pool A contemplative
Hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black
sunglasses and a business suit He watches Alma a moment
Finally she notices him

ALMA
Youre back early

He shrugs then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of
lemonade Alma gets out and towels herself off

ALMA (CONTD)
Im disappointed you didnt give Whits
book a chance

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
What about him

ALMA
He knows you well enough

She sits down next to him noticing a tiny hole in her
swimsuit Its starting to look a little threadbare
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Enjoy the pool now We might not have it
for that much longer

He looks off cryptically

ALMA
Why

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Paramount refuses to finance the movie
Imagine -- The studio that brought you
Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On
Earth considers Psycho distasteful

He brushes some fallen leaves off his chair

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Lew cant find the money Not quickly
enough at least

ALMA
Why not wait

He doesnt reply She knows him well enough too and doesnt
question him further

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Were going to have to go it alone old
girl

(BEAT)
Well finance the movie ourselves

ALMA
Are we going to have to sell the entire
house or just the pool

She looks at Hitch but hes not joking She turns to survey
their beloved home and gardens

A long pause

ALMA (CONTD)
Tell me and I wont ever ask again Why
this one Hitch Its not just because so
many people are telling you no is it

Pause

ALMA (CONTD)
Hitch

Without turning he takes her hand

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Remember the fun we had when we started
out and there was so little money and
time We took risks we experimented We
invented new ways of making pictures
because we had to

A long moment as he gazes across the pool

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
I want to feel that kind of freedom
again

He turns to look into her eyes for the first time A glimpse
of the real Hitchcock Someone even his wife doesnt see

that
often
EXT PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY
The famous gates and the executive building beyond it
LEW WASSERMAN (PRE-LAP)
Barney were about to propose a
restructured deal for Psycho
INT BALABANS PRIVATE OFFICE PARAMOUNT - DAY
Balaban watches Hitchcock and Lew closely Hitchcock again
is

like a waxworks Buddha revealing nothing

LEW WASSERMAN
We finance it Independently Paramount
only distributes itin exchange for 40
percent of the profits
BARNEY BALABAN
Interesting But tell us what exactly is
Paramount distributing Is this still a
picture about a queer killing people in
his mothers dress

LEW WASSERMAN
What this picture is about is the
reputation of Alfred Hitchcock

BARNEY BALABAN
No-ones arguing that

LEW WASSERMAN
Barney its very simple This is Mr
Hitchcocks next film Are you in or are
you out

A long silence

BARNEY BALABAN
Well obviously you have a lot of passion
for this project Let me talk it over
with a few people internally and Ill get
back to you

LEW WASSERMAN
No Now

Balaban takes in their inscrutable stares Not unimpressed
by

their chutzpah he leans back and puts his hands behind his

head a king in his counting room

BARNEY BALABAN
Fine Well take that deal If you can
get the money

Finally Hitchcock speaks up

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Weve already got it Barney

He pulls out his PERSONAL CHECKBOOK and opens it on the
desk
Barney watches as Hitch takes the onyx fountain pen from its
mount

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Who do I make it out to

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Hitch and Alma lie side by side in their separate beds A
copy of The Dance of Death by Strindberg lies on Hitchs
bedside table All traces of his bravado are gone

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
If this picture fails Alma well be in
for a long humiliating bout of crow-
eating

ALMA

Of the movie Not in the least But of
you Unquestionably

INT HITCHCOCKS OFFICE PARAMOUNT - DAY

PUDGY FINGERS part the slats of the blind Hitch stares out
hoping for some human moment to spy on Hes restless

Peggy ushers JOSEPH STEFANO 30s into Hitchs office

JOSEPH STEFANO
Joe Stefano Good to meet you

Hitchcock leaves Stefanos hand dangling in mid air and sits
down at his desk

JOSEPH STEFANO (CONTD)

Sorry I was late My shrink session ran
overtime I see him every day and its
still not enough

PEGGY
I thought only directors assistants
needed psychiatrists not writers

Stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as Peggy slips
out

The two men stare at each other but Stefanos not remotely
intimidated

JOSEPH STEFANO
Do you see a shrink Mr Hitchcock

Hitchs eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the
ceiling

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
No

His gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

I must say it boggles the mind to imagine
what you and your shrink could possibly
talk about daily

JOSEPH STEFANO
The usual sex Rage My mother

Hitchcock lowers his gaze suddenly intrigued
INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Alma sits with the Hitchcocks ACCOUNTANT whos consulting a
ledger She sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen

ACCOUNTANT
Theres still the federal income tax
payments the property taxes Not to

mention the absence of any salary while
hes actually making the film

ALMA
Stop waffling Donald Give it to me
straight

The Accountant takes off his glasses plucking up the
courage
to look his favorite client in the eye
to

waits

ACCOUNTANT
Hitch wasnt exaggerating If the films
a flop youre going to have to sell the
house

Alma digests this

ALMA
Where do you suggest we cut

ACCOUNTANT
Anywhere you can

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Almas moved to the kitchen table and is sorting through the
accounts herself the dogs at her feet Her face is now
properly filled with concern

Hitch enters holding out some typed pages Alma covers her
worry He puts the pages on the table next to her

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I got Joe Stefano to write out the first
few scenes Why dont you take a look

Alma takes Stefanos pages and starts to readHitch goes
the fridge and opens the door
ALMA
Were about to have dinner You dont
need anything else

He shuts the door Leans against the fridge door Hitch

but she gives nothing awayuntil she off-handedly places
the pages on the table

Well

She doesnt look up

temper
INT PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY
The intimidating plaque for the MPAAs PRODUCTION CODE
ADMINISTRATION OFFICE on the wall
Stefanos TITLE PAGE is tapped angrily by GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
70s the much-feared administrator for the Motion Picture
Production Code He sits at the head of a big table with TWO
ASSISTANTS Sitting opposite are Hitchcock Peggy and
several

silent PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
The Code will absolutely not permit you

to show a knife penetrating a womans
flesh

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I assure you Geoffrey my murders are
always models of taste and discretion

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
Is there any improper suggestion of
nudity in this murder scene in the
shower

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
She wont be nude Shell be wearing a
shower cap

Shurlock makes a note A man utterly devoid of any sense of
humor

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
We might accept a shot from outside the
bathroom window with Marion in silhouette
above the shoulders -- provided the glass
is frosted

Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt
Shurlock turns the page

G EOFFREY SHURLOCK
Then -- this scene with the toilet

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Its completely necessary Marion flushes
evidence later found by her sister Its
a clue to the girls disappearance

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
No American movie has ever found it
necessary to show a toilet let alone
to flush it

Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in
France and use a bidet instead

No response from Shurlocks end of the room Peggy stares
down at the table

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
Mr Hitchcock if this office denies you
a seal and were certainly heading in
that direction your movie will not be
released in a single theater in this
country Will you be making jokes then

Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK (CONTD)

Good Now why dont we go all the way
back to page two

boiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages --

INT PSYCHIATRISTS OFFICE BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

Sunlight filters through sheer curtains revealing Hitchcock
trying his best to recline on an ANALYSTS COUCH

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Everyone in Hollywood resents me I make
them millions and yet every year I sit
at those dreadful award show dinners
waiting for them to say just once
Youre good

He looks around the luxurious office

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

They take sadistic pleasure in denying me
that one little moment

ANALYSTS VOICE
That must hurt

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Deeply

Hitch fumbles for a handkerchief and mops his brow

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Youll have to excuse me doctor Im not
used to this process

ANALYSTS VOICE
Take your time

Now Hitch claws at his tie Its hot in here

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Its just that more and more lately
Ive been having these impulses

The analysts MONTBLANC pen makes a note on a pad We notice
that his hands are surprisingly coarse

ANALYSTS VOICE
What kind of impulses

Finally Hitchcock is still He stares up at the ceiling

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Strong ones

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

A FRIDGE DOOR SNAPS OPEN to reveal Hitchcocks FACE in the
darkness Hes in his pajamas His hand trembles next to a
stack of chicken breasts and moves to an upturned GRAPEFRUIT
HALF at the back of the shelf

He pulls it out it to reveal a hidden stash of foie gras
under the hollowed out grapefruit

Hes about to devour it when he catches sight of his
DISTORTED REFLECTION in the chrome shelving

He backs away disgusted at this monster before him the
light of the fridge illuminating his expression

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT

A door is quietly shut and locked The bottom drawer of a
filing cabinet is inched open A hand rummages deep inside
and teases out a bulging MANILA FOLDER A hidden stash of
some kind

The DESK LIGHT is switched on revealing HITCH He carefully
extracts the contents of the folder and lays them onto the
desk

A MASS OF PHOTOS OF ALL HIS BLONDE LEADING LADIES
A personal collection lovingly kept He settles in to study

it picking out his favorites arranging them in order
Theyre all in the same pose all with hair pinned up into a
perfect bun

He looks at each image with intensifying desire Hes
created

turns back to Peggy and Alma and pulls a face

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Send them all back to Glendale

Hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots
Peggy shares a glance with Alma then slides over RODDY
MCDOWELLS HEADSHOT

PEGGY
The Lazar Office tells me hes crazy to
work with you

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Well tell Swifty he shouldnt have
overexposed his client on television

ALMA
Unlike certain people we could mention

Hitch ignores the barb Undeterred Alma pushes her ace
card

a photo of ANTHONY PERKINS radiating offbeat sensitivity
and

teen idol looks

ALMA (CONTD)
Think of the duality he could bring to
Norman The rage lurking behind that
little-boy-lost grin The winsome charm
he uses to keep from being found out

Perkins is --

She raises her pinky finger just slightly Alma nods without
judgement

Pondering

INT HITCHCOCKS OFFICE PARAMOUNT - NEXT DAY
Anthony Perkins now sits across from Hitchcock

ANTHONY PERKINS
I cant count how many times Ive seen
Strangers On a Train and Rope

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Well Norman is the logical extension of
the boys in those movies Appealing
sensitive suffering the terrible burden
of being forced to pretend to be
something he is not

Hitchcocks deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins

ANTHONY PERKINS
My only worry is that playing Norman
might cut too close to home

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
How so

Hitchs calmness is strangely reassuring to the young
actor

ANTHONY PERKINS
I was incredibly close to my mother So
close I remember wishing my father would
drop dead And then when I was five he
did just thatHe keeled over froma
heart attack

(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
You see Ive been guilty my whole life
Mr Hitchcock

Hitch is enthralled

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Try to remember this is all just make
believe

Perkins wishes he could be more reassured

ANTHONY PERKINS
Not to be prudish but how far do you
plan to push Normans relationship with
his mother

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Further than you can possibly imagine

On Perkins uncertain expression -- what is he letting
himself
in for

EXT HITCHCOCK HOUSE GARDEN - DAY

Hitchcocks RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves Hes
dressed in gardening gear laboring in the full bloom of the
rose garden Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure

She shovels the manure around the rosebushes

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Im getting blisters just looking at you

ALMA
Stop grumbling A bit of fresh air and
exercise is exactly what you need

He holds his PRUNING SHEARS menacingly over a deep red
Sydonie rose

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
If I could get Grace Kelly to play the
girl theyd let me get away with
anything

ALMA
Well you cant Shes a princess now
which makes her permanently unattainable

Hitchcock beheads the ROSE muttering to himself

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
And all the more desirable

His shears are now poised over a yellow specimen

ALMA
Lew suggested Deborah Kerr

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Too Scottish

Hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect
pink rose

ALMA
What about Janet Leigh Shes always the
“good girl but she did awfully well in
Touch of Evil Lew mentioned her name Do
you remember how you always remarked on
her figure at the Wassermans parties

THE SLENDER WAIST AND AMPLE BOSOM OF JANET LEIGH as she
elegantly enters the dining room of Chasens

Hitch stands to greet her his eyes follow her across the
room in some private rapture

Alma watches as Janet removes her glove and shakes Hitchs
handbefore he guides her to the spot to his left across
from Alma

INT CHASENS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Hitch finishes telling his story

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Of course the real secret of Mrs
Simpsons appeal to the Duke of Windsor
was that she could make a toothpick feel
like a cigar

Hes so deadpan it takes a moment before she laughs

JANET LEIGH
You know Ive been so immersed in
preparing to play Marion Id almost
forgotten how to laugh

Hitch summons the waiter with a snap

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Now you must try the banana shortcake

JANET LEIGH
Nothing for me thank you Im watching
my figure

Alma watches all this with a fixed smile

ALMA
Youre not the only one
(to the waiter)
Were fine thank you

Hitchcock ignores Alma gesturing to the waiter again

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Bring her the banana shortcake George
In fact make it two large portions

He pointedly shifts to face Janet

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
So do tell me how else have youve
prepared to play Marion

Janet hesitates
JANET LEIGH

Ive written a complete history for
herIt seems silly but it helps me
She turns to pull a LEATHER NOTEBOOK from her handbag

Hitchs gaze locks onto her silken blonde hair tied
immaculately into the classic “Hitchcock bun

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
It doesnt sound silly at all Tell me
one of her deepest secrets

A quick look to Alma as if to ask for permission before

JANET LEIGH
She leads a double life For instance
when she works at the Lowery office she
wears Tweed perfume But when she and
Sam are together she recklessly breaks
out her one expensive bottle -- My Sin
by Lanvin

She notices Almas expression

JANET LEIGH (CONTD)

ButI do have a concern or two Im an
actress but Im also a wife and mother
first so Im wondering just how youll
do that shower scene

ALMA
You and the Shurlock Office

JANET LEIGH
Its just I mean even if you shoot me
from here --
(she indicates a spot just
above her bosom)
-- well its not as if my figure is
boyish

Hitchcock looks down at her torso as if noting it for the
first time

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Allow me to put your mind at rest
Alma reacts as Hitch reaches over and gives Janets hand a
reassuring squeeze

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
May I show you some of Mr Saul Basss
marvellous story boards

Hitch pulls out his folio case and shows Janet the
storyboards (which we dont see)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
I plan to shoot quick bits of film from
various angles

(MORE)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

Cut together this montage will suggest
nudity and violence but nothing will
actually be shown

Janet studies them deeply impressed And relieved

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
And having you in the shower will make it
all the more tit-illating --

If youll excuse me

Almas had enough Janets smile falters as she watches Alma
get up and head to the restroom Shes unsure of what just
happened but Hitch carries on regardless either entirely
oblivious or not caring at all

tasteless health-conscious food

Alma enters briskly and holds up a handwritten LIST

She places the list on the table

weekends off for the driver No
Absolutely not Well find other places
to cut

ALMA

There arent any other places And
furthermore theyll be no more shipments
from Maxims either We cant afford it

adequate

for the greater good dont we Alfred

hunger He SLAMS the fridge and --

She unhooks her bra and crosses to hang it on a hook right
near the HOLE where we just saw Hitchcocks eye His eye is
gone only darkness from the other side Vera feels a chill
and instinctively covers her breasts with her arm

“that could be me

He takes another BITE searching her face for some tell-tale
sign of guilt

better in the scene

You should tell Whit that Hed be

flattered

they rise and flex

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while Alma
finishes getting ready

Maybe I was too dismissive about your
friend Whitfields book Perhaps he and
Elizabeth could come over this weekend
and he can walk me through it

Almas radar activates but Hitch continues oh-so-
nonchalantly

Lovely woman Elizabeth

He carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder
victim Shes not exactly sure what hes implying but she
knows she doesnt like it

He starts by choosing your hairstyle and
clothes and then he wants to choose your
friends and decide how many children you
should have
roughly

Janet finds this a little hard to believe Vera leans in
lowering her voice

The blood drains from Hitchs face as he very slowly and
carefully replaces the receiver His mind starts to spin
Hes got to get out of there

Hitch lurches towards the production office starting to
sweat but his path is blocked by GRIPS laying cables The

set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos

A PR FLACK appears --

Hitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips
are moving a ladder He turns kicks a platter of healthy
snacks out of the way only for an ARCLIGHT to swivel in his
face and blind him

HITCH exits the soundstage doors only to find the humorless
face of BARNEY BALABAN blocking his office door

BARNEY BALABAN
Hello Hitch Hows the picture Im
hearing interesting things

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Its a wonder you can hear anything over
the noise coming from the Shurlock
office

Balaban offers up his handkerchief Hitchcock waves it away
even though hes now covered in sweat

BARNEY BALABAN
I shouldnt be in a position of just
hearing things Hitch Its time you
showed me some footage

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Why

BARNEY BALABAN
To see if youre making a picture
Paramount can actually release

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
As you well know Barney my contract
guarantees me final cut

required to distribute any film that
could cause us embarrassment

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

Hitchcock lies in bed tossing and turning the fever only
making his thoughts darker and more obsessive

ED GEIN (0S)
You forgot to look in the bathroom

Hitch notices the SHADOWY FIGURE standing at the end of his
bed

ED GEIN (CONTD)

A man like you Missing the vital clue
like that

He blearily sits up and sees Geins impassive rustic face

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
What do you mean
it

Gein steps over to the bathroom and pushes open the door

ED GEIN
My mother always said if youre going to
do a job do it right

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hitchcock enters the immaculate white and chrome room and
inspects it but nothing seems out of place

ED GEIN
Check the floor

He looks down but again nothing

ED GEIN (CONTD)
Closer

Hitch gets down on his hands and knees He runs his
fingertips across the smooth white tiles They start to
COLLECT --

GRAINS OF SAND

Sprinkled all over the floor

ED GEIN (CONTD)

You still think theyre just writing

together

Hitchcocks face hardens His lip trembles

ED GEIN (CONTD)
So what are you going to do about it

Hitch gets up opens the medicine cabinet and takes out a
BOTTLE OF BAYER ASPIRIN

He empties the tablets into the sink and very carefully
sweeps the SAND into the aspirin bottle He caps it slips

into his robe pocket and turns off the light

INT SOUNDSTAGE UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME

Alma spots the towering figure of Balaban stride onto the
stage accompanied by a MAN in a cardigan

ALMA
Barney

He sees her and bristles clearly surprised to see her

BARNEY BALABAN
Alma

Alma takes in Balabans companion and the viewfinder round
his neck

BARNEY
You know David Kirkpatrick Hes working
on Jerry Lewis next picture

She does They nod politely -- then stand there

BARNEY (CONTD)
So hes free to help
(a sly smile)
if you need it

Silence Just the bustle of crew members in the background

ALMA
That wont be necessary

BARNEY
But youre nearly three days behind

He takes a step towards Hitchs empty chair but Alma moves
to block his path It may be a small gesture but its

charged

Barney stares down at her

BARNEY BALABAN
Alma We both know what kind of film this
is
(then closer)
The smart thing to do would be to help
Hitch finish it

ALMA
Thank you for your concern Barney

She moves closer to him holding his gaze not bending one
bit

ALMA (CONTD)
But on a Hitchcock picture there is only
one director

The anger flashes on his face as she faces him down the
entire crew behind her now holding firm

EXT SOUNDSTAGE UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Balaban incensed leaves the stage with Kirkpatrick Alma
steps out into the sunlight not far behind them As she
watches them leave she lets out a breath

A voice calls out to her --

WOMANS VOICE
Mrs Hitchcock

She turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants anda
sleeveless top Shes carrying an elegantly wrapped package

JANET
I hope you dont mind I heard Hitch was
sick so I got hima little something

She hands Alma the gift A bag of candy corn tied with a
ribbon

ALMA
Thats kind of you

JANET
Well hes been very considerate with me
(A BEAT)
I havent always had that from my
directors

ALMA
Janet youve been very professional
It hasnt gone unappreciated

Alma takes in Janets unaffected natural beauty -- and her
sincerity

She cant help but notice the second glances Janet is
provoking from passers-by now

Shes an impossible rival for any woman
BEETHOVENS 3RD SYMPHONY “EROICA
Blares deafeningly

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

On the stereo Alma finds Hitch on the sofa swaddled in a
blanket and eating ICE CREAM

ALMA
May I turn that down

She silences the stereo Hitch doesnt react

ALMA (CONTD)
Youll be pleased to know order has been
restored

He still doesnt look at her masticating loudly

ALMA (CONTD)
A thank you would be nice

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Were still two days behind and sixty
thousand over budget

ALMA
I already cancelled the wrap party
Thatll save us two thousand right there
And you wont be tempted by any champagne
and cake

She pulls at the bowl of ice cream He refuses to let go
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Beware -- all men are potential

murderers

She yanks it from his grip
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
With good reason

ALMA
Alright whats this about

He slowly pulls the ASPIRIN BOTTLE from his robe pocket
building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours SAND into
a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Spending a lot of time at the beach

He puts down the bottle looking for a reaction

ALMA
Thats where Whit and I are writing Hes
rented a place

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Hardly the ideal setting to avoid

distractions

ALMA
Actually its very conducive to creative
collaboration

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I already told you -- that treatment is a
waste of time

ALMA
Didnt everyone say the same thing about
Psycho

She reaches for the ASPIRIN BOTTLE to throw it away but
Hitch
grabs it first --

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Are you and Whit having an affair

ALMA
Dont be absurd Hes working on
something new and needs a little help
thats all

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
What a coincidence Im working on
something new and I could use a little
help too

ALMA
What do you think Ive been doing

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Then why are you spending all hours of
the day and night with some overage
talentless mammas boy

ALMA
Because its fun

He quivers livid

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I am under extraordinary pressures on
this picture the least you can do is
give me your full support

ALMA
Full support Weve mortgaged our house
My house

Almas eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury

ALMA (CONTD)
Might I remind you that I have weighed-in
on every aspect of this film so far as I
have done on every picture youve done in
the last three decades And the first
time you show the film it will be my
notes that you want I celebrate with you
if the reviews are good and I cry for you
if they are not I host your parties and
put up with those fantasy romances with
your leading ladies And when youre out
promoting this film around the world I
will stand beside or rather slightly
deliver

horror

behind you smiling endlessly for the
press even when Im ready to drop being
gracious to people who look through me as
if I were invisible because all they can
see is the grand and glorious Alfred
Hitchcock

Hitchcock is stunned and silent

ALMA (CONTD)
Now for the first time in years I dare
to work on something that isnt an
Alfred Hitchcock Production and Im met
with accusation and criticisms This work
Im doing with Whit gives me pleasure and
purpose

(MORE)

ALMA (CONTD)
And even though that takes absolutely
nothing away from you please consider
this a reminder I am your wife Alma
Reville not one of the contract blondes
you badger and torment with your oh-so-
specific direction

She turns and with great dignity leaves Hitchcock sitting
in the gathering gloom Hes not the only one who can

a killer blow
INT SOUNDSTAGE UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY
ON HITCH

with that same lost expression on his face only now dark
shadow and harsh light alternate across his features

A NAKED LIGHT BULB dangles from the ceiling as STAGE HANDS
prepare the films climactic scene in the cellar

Hitch watches as VERA reaches out to touch the shoulder of
Mrs Bates We zoom in on her as she reacts in silent

her HAND flying up to hit the light bulb throwing crazy
shadows all over the set
We push in on Hitchcocks face as the strobing light briefly
illuminates the image of -

A SMALL BOY
at the foot of his mothers bed
INT VERA MILES DRESSING ROOM - LATER

A WIG on a stand A frumpy womans outfit on a hangar Vera
sits in front of the mirror and unties her own hair

VERA MILES
Free at last

Rita collects Veras detested wardrobe to take back to
wardrobe

VERA MILES (CONTD)
Thanks Rita

Vera rubs cold cream into her face to remove her make-up In
the mirror she sees Hitch in the doorway as Rita squeezes
past him on her way out

VERA MILES (CONTD)
(wiping off her make-up
with a Kleenex)

Hello Hitch

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Well Vera You always make it look so

easy

VERA MILES
Oh it was nothing Hitch I just faked
it

She gives him a dazzlingly ambiguous Miss America smile

VERA MILES (CONTD)
Well I guess this is au revoir
the

the

Hitch comes and stands behind her chair gazing at her in
mirror

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Why didnt you stay with me I would have
made you as big a star as Grace Kelly

She considers the question and the man asking it sensing
something different about him now She continues wiping off
her make-up

VERA MILES
Unlike Grace Kelly I can pick up my dry
cleaning Ive got a family Hitch A
home That will always mean more to me
than all of this

(THEN)
That blonde woman of mystery youre
after Shes a fantasy She doesnt
exist

He studies her a moment

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
There was a time when I thought I
understood you so completely --
understood women

Hitch gives a very slight bow touches her on the shoulder
then leaves Vera watches him go struck by his rare show of
vulnerability

EXT BEACH HOUSE SANTA BARBARA - DAY

Wind blows sand off the dunes Alma sits in the parked car
outside the beach house contemplating the typed pages on

seat next to her An inkling that they may not be as magical
as she had hoped

No matter She checks her reflection in the rearview and
applies some lipstick readying herself

She collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck
She sees two typewriters and paper but no sign of Whit
Something doesnt feel right

She turns and in the bedroom through the window she sees
Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the
pretty SECRETARY from the studio lot Alma and Whits eyes
meet Whit is horrified at being caught
Alma ducks her head wheels around in shock

ALMAS CAR

She yanks open the door and gets in Whit runs half dressed
from the house

WHITFIELD COOK

Alma I thought you were coming later
tonight

ALMA

I thought you rented this place so we
could write

WHITFIELD COOK
I did I swear -- this just happened

She struggles to get the key in the ignition

He puts his
hand desperately on the car door

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)
You wont say anything will you

ALMA
Dont worry I wont tell Elizabeth

WHITFIELD COOK
I mean to Hitch

Whit smiles feebly

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)
We cant all be geniuses

Alma tries to hide what a body blow this is

WHITFIELD COOK (CONTD)

Alma -- youre incredibly talented But
after all we want him to read the
script with an open mind

ALMA
Oh I wouldnt worry about that Whit

She starts the car and drives off
Whit watches deflated knowing hes ruined everything his
receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light

INT SCREENING ROOM PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY

WE PLAY THIS SCENE ONLY OVER THE FACES OF A SMALL INVITED
AUDIENCE -- THEIR EXPRESSIONS TELL US THAT THE FOOTAGE THEY
ARE SEEING IS NOT GOING OVER WELL NOT AT ALL

Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives Lew

discreetly checks his watch out of boredom Shurlock and his

two Assistants look appalled Composer BERNARD HERRMANN
late

40s prickly sits in the back row looking suicidal He

glances back at Hitchcock who stands near the screening room

door looking worse if that could be possible

EXT SCREENING ROOM PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - LATER

Shurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock whos waiting in the
foyer

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
Youre going to have to cut all that
nudity

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
What nudity It was suggested

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
I definitely saw that knife jabbing her

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
We did no such shot

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
Id stake my reputation on it Im
recommending you cut the shower scene
entirely

Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Ill go over it frame by frame and set up
another screening
But Shurlock is already walking away

Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with

BALABAN Hitch searches their expressions for some
indication

but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Whats the verdict

LEW WASSERMAN
Lets just say it was a four-letter
review and it wasnt “good

The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock

LEW WASSERMAN (CONTD)
Screw him Its too late for Paramount to
back out no matter what Balaban says

Hitch just stands there

LEW WASSERMAN (CONTD)

The other route is to recut it as a two-
parter for the TV series Because of the
budget and the Hitchcock name we stand a
good chance of breaking even

Still Hitch doesnt say a word

LEW WASSERMAN (CONTD)

Look I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire
of Winchester 73 and that was a dog At
least I could sit through your picture

Hitch stares bleakly off He cant help noticing the KIM
NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside hand in hand and
kissing her date

LEW WASSERMAN (CONTD)
More importantly what does Alma think

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

floating across its surface

ALMA
Well it is only a house

INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT

The dogs GEOFFREY and STANLEY lap away at a water bowl in
the study A splash or two of something is added to the bowl
from above Its being poured from Hitchs brandy glass

HITCH
pours himself another glass leaving the dogs lapping
away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand Theres a bank

silver-framed PHOTOS on top He pauses to take a proper look
at them

His and Almas life together in movies Smiling at Premieres
with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly On vacation with Jimmy and

Gloria Stewart At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and
Gregory Peck

But its the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he

A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The
Mountain Eagle in 1926 He picks it up and looks at it

The young Hitchcock in front of the camera dramatically
calling Action on his first film His eyes dont have to
move far to find ALMA standing just behind him making

on her clipboard the same intense serious look on her
They look so young

Hitch turns to look out the window thoughtful -- Hitchs
POV Its SNOWING outside

INT GEIN HOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT

We pull back to discover the window is now in a basement lit
by a single oil lamp

We find Gein sitting at his workbench Hitchcock is perched
on a stool nearby watching him

Trash and newspapers are piled everywhere There is grime

and

dark stains on the cabinets and counters

ED GEIN

This is my favorite place I just shut

the doors and leave the world behind

Hitch watches Gein as he threads a needle stitching

something expertly together He notices theres no hint of a

tremble in Geins hands

ED GEIN (CONTD)

Pass me that bag will you

Hitch passes over the shopping bag then pulls up his

coat

feeling a chill

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Dont you get lonely out here sometimes

ED GEIN
I can always talk to my mother

HEADLIGHTS SUDDENLY RAKE THE ROOM

As we hear CARS pull up -- a lot of them The sound of MEN
shouting Flashing RED AND BLUE LIGHTS LOUD KNOCKING at the
DOOR --

ED GEIN (CONTD)
Thats strange

FOOTSTEPS thunder above him DOZENS OF OFFICERS are fanning
out all over the house

CAPTAIN SCHOEPHOERSTER (0S)

Hitch watches as Gein just sits there and the sound of
SHOCKED reactions and horrified GASPS continue above

CAPTAIN SCHOEPHOERSTER (CONTD)
I think we found his hiding spot

ED GEIN

(SOTTO VOCE)
They cant go in there Thats my

TWO

SEVERED HANDS FOLDED IN PRAYER

Titles from a dark 1946 romantic melodrama fill the screen
“THE SECRET HEART

SCREENPLAY BY WHITFIELD COOK

Alma sits watching the afternoon movie alone brushing the
dogs on the sofa next to her

ANGLE ON DOORWAY
Hitchcock reads Almas fragile emotional state and enters

sits down beside her and studies the screen for a moment

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
An odd little movie Of course Colbert
is wonderful

Alma nods They watch for a beat longer

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
How was the beach

ALMA
Cold and miserable

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Just like Barney Balabans face

He indicates the over-ripe dialogue coming from the TV

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Whit isnt worth a damn when hes not
working with you
(PAUSE)
And neither am I

Alma takes in his reflective expression but says nothing
squeeze

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
I didnt pull off the picture this time
It just sits there refusing to come to

life

(THEN)
Theres no other way to say it Its
stillborn

ALMA turns away
Hitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
I let you down my love

He moves closer and takes her hand Gives it a small

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
You deserved better

She still doesnt move After a moment Hitch gets to his
feet

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Ill go and feed Geoffrey and Stanley
shall I

He exits with the dogs padding after him She turns back to
the screen and more of that stilted mannered dialogue

Tears well in her eyes
EXT HITCHCOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

A full moon The ONLY LIGHT from inside the house is the one
in the kitchen

We glimpse the figure in the window A corpulent man in
profile like a Hopper painting
INT HITCHCOCK HOUSE KITCHEN - LATER

Hitch sits in his nightgown pushing some VEGETABLES around
his plate -- his healthy midnight snack

Alma enters in her robe Hitch watches her She goes to the
fridge opens the PRODUCE DRAWER and from under the brussel
sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of BELUGA CAVIAR

She gets the crackers a plate and a spoon and sits down at
the table next to him
ALMA
I dont think I can stand both of us
being maudlin

She fixes several crackers each with an appropriate dollop
of caviar on top and puts the plate in the middle

ALMA (CONTD)
There is one solution to all this you
know

She offers him one of the crackers

ALMA (CONTD)
We could both get to work -- together

Tentatively Hitch accepts it

ALMA (CONTD)
That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation
Ive been helping Whit finish is done

Hitch remains quiet delicately consuming his cracker

ALMA (CONTD)
So I suggest for everyones sake we
start whipping Psycho into shape
tomorrow You may not be the easiest man
to live with but you know how to cut a
picture better than anyone

Hitch puts the lid back on the caviar

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Except for you

A series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life
CANS OF FILM ARE BROUGHT IN BY ASSISTANTS STRIPS OF
CELLULOID ARE PULLED OUT INSPECTED AND MARKED WITH CHALK
WHILE OTHERS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER

HITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like
schoolboys while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola

ALMA
Youll need to cut those six or seven
frames where she blinks after shes
supposed to be dead

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Weve seen the footage a thousand times
She doesnt blink
Alma gives him a look

INT EDITING ROOM - LATER

powerful

PEGGY
I think Im never going to take a shower
again

Alma turns to him and Hitch nods slightly Was that the
tiniest acknowledgement that her instinct may have been
right

INT PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY

ON SHURLOCKS HUMORLESS FACE

Hitchcock sits opposite him at the big conference table

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
I told you I distinctly saw both the
stabbing and the nudity Were denying
your seal Mr Hitchcock

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I take your opinion very seriously But
what you think youre seeing is purely
informed by the power of suggestion I
assure you that once you view the final
version with Mr Herrmanns lovely
lyrical score

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
A lyrical score wont change my
opinion All that innuendo and half-naked
groping -- really Hitch

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Would you mind if we had a word in
private Geoffrey

Shurlock gestures his staff out Hitch moves closer

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)

I have a modest proposal to make If
youre willing to leave the shower
sequence as it is I will reshoot the
opening love scene to your exact
specifications

Shurlock reacts with surprise

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
In fact Id welcome your personal
supervision on the set

Shurlock is more flattered than hed care to admit

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
My specifications

If only audiences could fully appreciate
how tirelessly you work to help us
entertain them while protecting them from
filth and indecency
Shurlock studies Hitchcocks sphinx-like expression

That I respected him Deeply

Peggy laughs Now she understands

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Ladies and gentleman that is a wrap
Thank you all

The crew starts breaking things down The actors are
baffled
Janet walks over to him

JANET LEIGH

No need The charade is over

Hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the
dressing room

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
See I wasnt that much of a monster to
work with was I

JANET LEIGH
Not at all

He offers his hand and she shakes it determined to be
professional to the end

JANET LEIGH (CONTD)
I just hope I was sufficiently loyal to
the cause

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Worthy of a Purple Heart my dear
She leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek A moment of
unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless

She walks away to her dressing room Hitch watches as she
steps inside and closes the door

After a moment we hear a PIERCING SCREAM --
INT JANET LEIGHS DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Janet recoils at the sight of A MRS BATES PROTOTYPE PROP
MASK grinning lewdly from her chair and wearing one of
Janets brassieres

Hitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running

on everyone and then after a moment SCREAMS AGAIN but
this time not out of shock

the booklets are bound by swift-moving WORKERS we see
Hitchcocks photo on a cover and his advice to theater
owners

My first instruction to Theater Owners
Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce
our unique admission policies

INT NEW YORK THEATRE - FLASH FORWARD

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (VO)

To further emphasize the sheer
unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho
right after the closing title THE END
we strongly recommend that you close your
house curtains over the screen for a full
thirty seconds

Inside the theatre the manager makes sure the CURTAINS open
and close correctly then turns to face the vast empty
auditorium

ALFRED HITCHCOCKS VOICE
By doing so the horror of Psycho will
be indelibly etched in the mind and heart

stone-

of your audience

He anxiously surveys the hundreds of seats that will have to
be filled

But Hitchs nerves are hardly soothed The people in line
start to notice the Hitchcocksis it really them

PEGGY
Comes over to greet them with the THEATRE MANAGER

PEGGY
We can go through the side entrance

As the theatre manager ushers them through the side alley --

THEATER MANAGER
Right this way Mr and Mrs Hitchcock

Hitchcock turns to Alma

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Ready for the gallows

INT NEW YORK THEATRE LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

The atmosphere is tense as people hurry to their seats Lew
greets them

LEW WASSERMAN
Weve roped off some seats for you

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
You go on ahead

ALMA
Are you sure

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Ill join you in a minute
the

Off Almas look

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
I want to double check the print

ALMA
Fine darling Ill save you a seat

Lew escorts Alma and Peggy into the auditorium
INT NEW YORK THEATER PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
The soothing whir of the projector as Hitchcock stands next
to it but the sound of the audience below TITTERING
NERVOUSLY is anything but reassuring
ALFRED HITCHCOCK

(under his breath)

But theyre laughing too much
He peers down through the tiny window but cant see a bloody
thing
INT NEW YORK THEATRE DOWNSTAIRS LOBBY - A MINUTE LATER
Hitch inches open the door and PEERS THROUGH THE CRACK at

audience but now he cant read them Are they gripped with
suspense -- or do they just hate it

From the lobby we see

HITCH
as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the
empty corridor A scared lonely corpulent figure Totally
powerless
Theres nothing for him to do but wait
And wait
And wait
Across the foyer a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up
ticket stubs and empties ashtrays quietly going about his
business entirely oblivious
ON HITCHS FACE

As he grips the railing This is taking far too long

And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A
into

line

BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM
Soon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR then breaks
LAUGHTER again nervous laughter this time the best kind

HITCH

As he gestures with his hands a conductor leading his
orchestra raising them up again as the audience STARTS
SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue

PUSHING TIGHTER ON HITCH

As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out
leaving only relief and satisfaction and making way for a
smile the largest of his whole career

INT NEW YORK THEATRE - LATER

Hitch Alma and Peggy are led out into the foyer by the
theatre manager There are still SCREAMS in the theatre as
the show continues

Lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre managers office
in the background as Hitch Alma and Peggy walk past the

of ticket buyers to get to the front doors There is great
excitement now as more and more people recognize the
Hitchcocks

WOMAN WAITING ON LINE
Mr Hitchcock how does it end

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I promised Mother I wouldnt tell

He gets a laugh Hitchcock walks alongside the Theater
Manager whos not going to miss out on having his own moment
with the crowd

THEATER MANAGER
Mr Hitchcock what do I do now that my
wife wont take a shower after seeing
your movie
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Have her dry-cleaned

Laughter as Lew appears

LEW WASSERMAN
I just got off the phone with Balaban I
couldnt resist telling him were sold
out for the next two weeks

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
What did he say

LEW WASSERMAN
He said Tell Hitch congratulations A
well deserved triumph as we always knew

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
As we always knew

The two friends a look

PEGGY
Does this mean I can take the weekend off
now

Hitch playfully shrugs well see

THEATRE MANAGER
Im sorry Mr Hithcock but there are
photographers outside They heard you
were here

The theatre manager ushers them towards the exit doors
EXT THEATRE - DAY (LATER)

A few photographers snap Hitch as he emerges and heads past
the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car Hitchcock
gestures for Alma to take her place next to him instead of
behind him She shyly waves him away but eventually and
appreciatively relents

As the flashbulbs start to POP --

ALMA
This could be the biggest hit of your
career Alfred

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Our career Alma

He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep intense
gratitude and joy As more flashbulbs pop --

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Ive realized Ill never be able to find
a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you

ALMA
You do realize Ive been waiting decades
to hear you say that

He gives her a gentle peck

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
And that madame is why they call me
The Master of Suspense

He helps her into the car

INT CENTRAL STATE HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

It is a utilitarian institutionalized dining room Several
nonviolent INMATES eat at different round tables around the
room

An ATTENDANT watches and an ORDERLY mops the floor (there
are NO female patients nor staff members)

THE REAL ED GEIN

is at a table with two other patients including a soft
spoken older man CHET Ed is heavier his hair is whiter
and he is much more at ease than weve ever seen

ORDERLY
(to the Attendant)
coolest

star

Guess what Im doing this weekend

ATTENDANT
What

ORDERLY
Claudine and I are driving to Chicago
with her folks to see that Psycho movie

The Attendant pulls the orderly aside and whispers to him

nodding toward Ed The Orderlys jaw drops It is the
thing hes ever heard He looks at Ed like hes a movie
Meanwhile Ed yawns content Utterly oblivious

CHET
I think youre the happiest guy Ive ever
known Ed How you do it

ED GEIN

Tll tell you You live your life and
its unbearable sometimes but theres
this secret Chet a big secret no one
else knows or wants to tell
(he leans a little closer)

there is a God and hes so big and
powerful he doesnt always remember
youre there

He takes a huge bite blueberry pie

ED GEIN (CONTD)

but if you can get his attention and
he sees youre suffering hell notice
and hell take care of you My mother
used to tell me -- shes passed God
bless her -- the one thing God truly
loves and understands is suffering

He takes a long drink of milk

ED GEIN (CONTD)
After all he invented it

We pan to discover HITCHCOCK has been watching all this

turns to the camera

He
cant

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
And so gentle viewer Psycho -- the
picture everyone predicted would bring me
to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that
Alma and I got to Well lets just say
that we got to keep our house -- and the
swimming pool And the same critics who
despised it went on to call it one of my
greatest achievements

He produces a CIGAR and wanders towards the exit doors

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Of course for me it was just another
moo-vie

As he strolls through the door --
EXT HITCHCOCK HOUSE GARDEN - DAY

-- and seamlessly appears in the beautifully tended gardens
as if having walked through a portal

ALFRED HITCHCOCK
But you know what they say in Hollywood
Youre only as good as your last
picture So now if youll excuse me I
must toddle off to begin the exhaustive
search for my next project

He holds out his cigar towards something we dont yet see

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Unfortunately I find myself once again
bereft of all inspiration I do hope
something comes along soon

A SMALL BIRD

Alights on his cigar tip and FLAPS its wings Hitchcock
resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which
promptly flies away He gives the camera a final

characteristically deadpan look

ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONTD)
Good evening
Hitch

The distinctive THEME TUNE to his TV show starts up and

toddles back up the front lawn and toward the terrace where
Alma can be seen laying out a delicious healthy lunch
