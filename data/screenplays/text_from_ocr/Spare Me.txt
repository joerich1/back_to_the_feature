Buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat

KASTLE
And look at that both partners go down
together Kastle shoves the sculpture
onto the floor stands up and crushes it
under his heel He goes over and puts his
arm around Buzz

orange whips are arrayed around the table

Make a wish son
Junior stares into Sheilas eyes for several seconds

JUNIOR
Same wish as last year

Sheila blows out the candles in a hurry

SHEILA

Kastle places a gift-wrapped box in front of Junior and lifts
the lid He reaches in and pulls out a huge intricate claw-
like arm-shaped device made of plastic and metal and covered
with cables

KASTLE
Its a bowling claw You can bowl now
Junior With the whole family Junior
beams at the group

KASTLE
(puts one arm around Junior and
one on Theo)
Pretty soon everybody can bowl

The two sleazeballs walk up onto the deck and over to the
table

Theo stretches to get a nearby ball but just cant reach it
by millimeters

JUNIOR
To play I press my fingers on a throat
like this
(he presses tighter on Theos
windpipe)

and then the mans face would go blue
and I should keep pressing

(Theos face goes pale blue)
and I did and then he stopped moving
and he didnt play anymore after that
Theo bends back a finger on Juniors
hand Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and
releases Theos neck Theo GASPS for air

JUNIOR
You didnt play fair

You were almost blue

Theo gets his fingers in a bowling ball and brings it up to
bash Junior in the head

JUNIOR
Go ahead Theo I saw you on TV Im your
biggest fan Junior offers Theo his
unprotected head

his malfunctioning arm Theo rolls away as Juniors flailing
releases the machine It comes slamming down on Junior just

freaked I was seven He took all my
dolls away from me and cut them in half
He gave the top halves back to

bowling ball inscribed with The Faz at the head The
pallbearers Theo Breeze Sid Tina and two other bowlers
place the coffin on poles above the grave A rotund priest
sprinkles holy water Sheila stands next to Theo crying

Theo wears a glazed look The priest clears his throat with a
loud AHEM

PRIEST

Bowling

(pauses to reflect)
Bowling is a little like faith Every now
and then we are blessed with the ability
and strength to send a full roller down

(makes bowling gesture)
and scatter those babies like nobodys
business And every now and then we end
up in the gutter

(pauses and gets glum)
Buzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter
of life Trapped in hook alley throwing
nothing balls But before he left us for
that pie alley in the clouds he pulled

himself out of that gutter

Buzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of

bowling Now he lies at peace alongside

his lane brothers here in Bowlers Field
(makes sign of the cross)

He died so that we could bowl - with

dignity Millie decked out in mourning

black lets out a wail steps up and

throws a bouquet of flowers onto the

coffin

(sniffles)
I forgive you Buzz

Sid leans over to Theo

SID

(in loud whisper)

cash rub with fingers)
Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to
suppress a snigger Sid - trying to keep
a straight face - elbows him Sid and
Breeze approach the coffin Breeze pulls
an orange whip out of a paper bag and
carefully places it on the coffin lid

ground A stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets Sheila
nudges Theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into
the grave

just come here to take it out on
somebody But I had to find my father
The muffled BEEPING of Raindrops Keep
Falling On My Head begins playing from

runs after Sheila who is walking towards
her scooter

The two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk
towards their car Theo grabs Sheilas jacket

diminutive fiftyish woman His back is
to the camera and he is wearing a
baseball cap with a plastic halo attached
to it

WOMAN

Theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball He
tosses it to Buzz

Theo turns and walks towards his car Buzz pauses and walks
after him

The sign has been changed to SHEILAS ALLEY A sparkling
new badass super-chromed Vespa is parked in the handicap
zone The Barbie and Ken dolls are wired to the headlamp
They look incredibly worse for the wear A parking ticket is
nestled between them Theos car pulls in nearby

81 INT SHEILAS ALLEY 81

Theo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with
serious bowling types As he walks towards the back of the
alley several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe

LUNA

Theo walks on Others greet the conquering hero

BOWLER
Theo Hey Theos back

TINA

LITTLE GIRL
(still crying)
Waaaaaaaaaaah

At the far end we see Sheila dressed in a fitted jogging
suit bowling alone on her lane Bowlers stop and hold their
balls at their sides Sheila notices the whole alley is
silent Theo steps up to the lane bowling ball bag in hand
As he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and
sees a seven-ten split mule ears

CUT TO
82 BLACKNESS 82
A loud ZIP and light spills in through three holes Three
fingers approach the holes blocking out the light once more
With a POP the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the
lane with a KLUNK
LANE
The camera races towards the pins along the maple boards

PINS

Two pins loom in the foreground one at each edge of the
screen The ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow
motion with a ROAR Theos eyes slowly close The pin lifts
and hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting
fellow pin Theos eyes open With a reverberating EXPLOSION
the pin is taken out

83 INT SHEILAS ALLEY THEO and SHEILA 83
Theo turns to Sheila and takes her in his arms

SHEILA

THEO

SHEILA
(touches his lips)
Lips still for sale

THEO

(nonchalantly)

in the tongue

SHEILA
(she pulls away slightly)
Can you change something this big

She pulls out a hundred dollar bill

THEO

Sheila stuffs the bill down Theos pants

SHEILA
Youll owe me

They smooch big time One by one balls drop to the lanes
again and pins start CRASHING

Buzzs at the head
DISSOLVE TO
85 EXT MINI-GOLF COURSE 85

Buzzs silhouette against an orange sunburst sky He wears
his halo hat He takes a beautiful PGA-perfect slow motion
fluid golf swing connecting with a THWAP As he follows
through divots of turf dance at his feet MUSIC swells He
holds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball off into
the distance

FADE OUT
