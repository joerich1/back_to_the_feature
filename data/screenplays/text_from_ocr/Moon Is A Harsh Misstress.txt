OVER BLACK

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
The history books got it wrong
This is how it really happened

FADE UP ON

THE EARTH Blue and silent in the majesty of space We’re
looking at it from the THE SURFACE OF THE MOON A FACE
bounces up INTO FRAME MANNIE early thirties He looks
like he’s about to vomit in the HELMET of his PRESSURE SUIT

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
So that’s me Manuel Garcia
O’Kelly Davis Proud Loonie

He’s YANKED FROM VIEW A BOOTED FOOT arcs through FRAME
Now his face reappears twisted sideways in his helmet

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Okay maybe not always proud but
always Loonie That is citizen of
Luna Sometimes called “The Moon”
But only ever by those live on
Terra

WIDER He’s getting the snot beat out of him by a LARGER MAN
in a darker p-suit We don’t see his assailant’s face but
one thing’s for sure a fist fight in zero gravity is
trickier than you might have thought A bizarre ballet

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
No Loonie refers to our world as
somebodys “moon” Moon’s a thing
exists only in relation to another
thing A satellite That kind of
talk-talk’s reserved for bigots
down on Terra Or “Earth” guess
they’d say And that’s where all
this trouble started But ya gotta
go back

CUT TO
STOCK NEAL ARMSTRONG hops from the Apollo 11 ladder --

NEAL ARMSTRONG
That’s one small step for --

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Further back than that

SMASH CUT TO
EXT PRIMORDIAL JUNGLE - NIGHT - A FULL MOON
The WORDS “The Dawn Of Man” come up ON SCREEN

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
We were all Terrans once

A GROUP OF MONKEY MEN gather around a watering hole One
MONKEY MAN sees the REFLECTION of the SHIMMERING MOON in the
pond he whirls sees it in the night sky He starts
SCREECHING at it Other PRIMATES join One throws a rock
Then another Now they’re all HURLING ROCKS at the Moon

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Guess you could say mankind’s
always had a complex relationship
with Luna When our ancestors
weren’t throwing rocks at it

EXT STONEHENGE - NIGHT - CELTS
in WHITE ROBES worship the moon

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
they were praying to it

STOCK LON CHANEY JR TRANSFORMS INTO THE WOLFMAN

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
or blaming it for one damn thing
or another

EXT MOUNT WILSON - TELESCOPE - NIGHT
An ASTRONOMER studying the MOON

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
But like anything man gets a good
look at comes a point when
looking’s not enough Man’s gotta
touch a thing And so

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE JFK Gives “moon” speech
JFK MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
We choose to go to the moon during a time of great
peace and prosperity
STOCK 1960s CHAOS Riots protests assassinations
MANNIE’S VOICEOVER

buncha big brains got together
to figure out how
INT LAB - NIGHT - SCIENTISTS

IN WHITE LAB COATS looking like the white-robed Celts
gathered around a hanging MODEL of The Moon

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
And they did

STOCK A ROCKET in mid-launch BURSTS INTO FLAME CRUMBLES

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Eventually

IN BLACKNESS STATIC CHIRPS and POPS then

ASTRONAUT’S VOICE (VO)
Houston -- Tranquility Base here
The Eagle has landed

INT MISSION CONTROL - DAY - GEEKS

CHEER and APPLAUD and slap each other on the back as above
them Armstrong’s transmission is visible on video screens

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Mission was meant to bring world
together Show from great distance
that Earth was one big place Did
no such thing

MONTAGE - FIFTY YEARS OF VIOLENCE Building in intensity
Fast faster faces blood pain Slamming to a stop at

EXT THE MOON - LUNAR SURFACE

A series of DISSOLVES past various items left by Apollo
crews Frozen in time Landing on THE AMERICAN FLAG

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Be more’n half a century before
anyone else set foot on Luna

A BOOT comes down WE ARM UP to the SCARRED FACE of

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Joe Banks AKA “Joe The Whip”
First Warden of Luna Official
title was “Protector of Lunar
Colonies by Appointment of Lunar
Authority” It was Joe brought
first boatload of convicts up from
Terra Hard men Worst of the
worst Murderers and rapists
CONVICTS in state issued p-suits shuffle down a ramp from a
SHUTTLE GUARDS in p-suits flank this grim procession

EXT THE MOON - EXCAVATION SITE - LATER
Cons work heavy equipment A massive dig in progress

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Some called it slave labor camp
Yammerheads on Federated Nations
Security Council called it “Work
furlough program” Experiment in
peace and big brotherhood

CAMERA SWOOPS down into the dig tunnels and caverns and
scaffolding A prison city is being built inside the Moon

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Those first inmates were told they
could dig their way back to Earth
Work off prison sentences with hard
labor go home free men Only
going home not so easy

EXT THE MOON - EXCAVATION SITE - MONTHS LATER

A group of EIGHT CONVICTS boards the Prison Shuttle Prison
numbers on p-suits transform to the word “PAROLED”

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
What workers didn’t know what
nobody knew was after months in
low-gravity of Luna a man’s
physiology changed innards
adjusted to new conditions

INTEXT PRISON SHUTTLE - SPACEEARTH’S ATMOSPHERE
As the shuttle moves into the Earth’s atmosphere --
MANNIE’S VOICEOVER

Most didn’t make it through re-

entry into heavy Earth atmo
The Eight Parolees no longer wearing full pressure suits
lounging in the shuttle Veins BULGE Blood seeps from
eyes mouths ears SCREAMS ECHO INTO BLACKNESS

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
After that mood changed on Luna

SMASH CUT TO
INT THE MOON - LUNA CONSTRUCTION

A PRISON RIOT in progress INMATES overpower GUARDS and send
them to their deaths by ejecting them through AIR-LOCKS

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Uprising of ‘72 captured what was
then eighty per cent interior of
Luna Authority Earthside offered
to send up more guards to retake
prison But Warden requested
different kind of reinforcements

EXT THE MOON - A NEW PRISON SHUTTLE
sets down on the surface
INT THE MOON - LUNA CONSTRUCTION

INMATES lay in wait A RAMP lowers from an air lock NEW
CONVICTS in P-SUITS shuffle down first-timers awkward in the
low gravity The air lock ramp shuts Helmets are removed
Lots of cascading hair This new batch ALL FEMALE

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
They’d cleaned out three North
American women’s prisons Riots
stopped Order restored And
birthrate skyrocketed

INT THE MOON - LUNA CONSTRUCTION - YEARS LATER

FIELDS of WHEAT under artificial sunlight LAMPS MALE and
FEMALE inmates work the fields along with CHILDREN

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
The first gen-farms were yielding
grain before end of second decade
Crops grew so fast in womb of
mother Luna almost couldn’t ship
harvest back to Terra fast enough

INT GRAIN LIFT EXT LUNAR SURFACE

A HUGE CARGO CONTAINER rises on a lift to the LUNAR SURFACE
where it is slid into the mitt of a GIANT CATAPULT --

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Catapult was operational by third
harvest No more did Terran
freighters have to make trip up
from Earth to haul back shipments
THE CATAPULT launches the freight Free of gravity it
floats then sails toward Earth picking up speed as it goes

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Space Pilots Union not too happy
with this method But no one could
argue efficiency

EXT SPACE - CARGO CONTAINER
Small booster rockets occasionally adjust its trajectory

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Takes almost no fuel to keep
freight on course Heavy gravity
pull from Terra provides the rest

EXT INDIAN OCEAN - DAY

The huge container hurtles toward the ocean and SPLASHES
down TUGS are right there guiding the retrieval

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
In seventy years of grain delivery
never once lost shipment -- nor
missed target Proud Loonie
record Of course most of the
credit goes to Mike Mike guided
it all from deep inside Luna

INT THE MOON - LUNA CONSTRUCTION
CAMERA RACES down half-finished tunnels and construction

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Mike wasn’t official name Id
nicknamed him “Mike” for Mycroft
Holmes from a story written by Dr
Watson This story character would
just sit and think -- and that’s
what Mike did A fair dinkum-
thinkum Oh should probably
mention Mike was a computer

CAMERA BURROWS through a final tunnel and into
INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX - COMPUTER ROOM
An enormous computer in a two-thirds finished state CAMERA

goes literally INTO the computer zipping around in its cyber
nervous system Fathomless capacity here
MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Mike was installed to compute
ballistics for pilotless freighters
and control the Catapult This
kept him busy less than one percent
of the time And Luna Authority
never believed in idle hands

WE SHOOT back out into the computer room and in a TIME LAPSE
we see Mike’s evolution growing becoming more complex --

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
So they started plugging more and
more new hardware into him
Decision action boxes bank on bank
of added memory

FAST TRACKING back the way we came back into the ragged
tunnel now following computer grids and electrical currents

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
more banks of associational
neural nets another tubful of
twelve-digit random numbers

As Mike’s reach expands so does Luna TIME LAPSE MORPHING
from CONSTRUCTION to PRISON to CITY advancing generations

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
As Luna Colony grew so did demands
on Mike Until he had eyes and
ears everywhere

What was a prison is now a PULSING METROPOLIS A patchwork
of HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS sprawling MARKET PLACES HIGH SPEED
TRAINS cut into the rock as far as the eye can see

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Human brain has around ten-to-the-
tenth neurons By seventh
generation Mike had better than
one and half times that number of
neuristors and woke up

CAMERA ROCKETS forward A BLUR until we’re back in
INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX - COMPUTER ROOM

The lights and digital readouts dim flicker then get a
little brighter A suggestion of some kind of change

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
How did I know this Mike told me
On VIDEO SURVEILLANCE MONITORS WE SEE two FIGURES walking
down labyrinthine ramps One of them we recognize as MANNIE

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
I was the only one he told Mike
trusted me I was Luna’s best and
first computer repairman Whenever
Mike had hiccup they’d call me in

We MATCH CUT from the men on the monitors to them live in
INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX -— RAMPSCORRIDORS
A CLERK leads Mannie into the bowels of the place

MANNIE
Glitch What kind of “glitch”

CLERK
Payroll program Check was
supposed to be issued to a janitor
for one hundred and eight Authority
scrip dollars Computer issued it
for one hundred million billion one
hundred and eight Authority scrip
dollars and fifteen cents

MANNIE
(impressed)
Off by a hundred million billion

CLERK
And fifteen cents

MANNIE
That’s a glitch

CLERK
That’s what I’m thinking too
Step up

Mannie steps up to an EYE SCAN A thin RED BEAM shoots into
his eye WE TRAVEL into Mannie’s eyeball where WE SEE an
implant behind the ocular nerve react to the beam

CLERK
Youre clear

INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX - COMPUTER ROOM - LATER
The impatient Clerk stands by as Mannie rummages in panels

checks monitors Mutters to himself like a car mechanic
who’s getting ready to stick you with a huge repair bill
MANNIE

Oh yeah Yep What I feared
CLERK

What
MANNIE

You got a computer here can’t add
Say what you will about computers
but they’re generally known for
being good with numbers You over-
load a logic the math goes Once
math goes Well First it’s bad
checks next thing Luna City’s
oxygen mix gets miscalculated and
we wake up all purple and dead

CLERK
Oh Can you fix it

Mannie grabs hold of his left arm and -- snap Pops it off
at the elbow

MANNIE
You best gimme some space

Mannie sets the half-arm aside The FINGERS twitch

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Don’t know about you but I finda
well-timed dismemberment can make
an impression

Mannie pulls another arm from his tool kit a prosthetic
It looks like it could be a neurosurgeons tool He snaps
on does the cyber-equivalent of cracking his knuckles
lasers and micromanipulators retract and claw

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Id lost my own wing years before
Got a dozen replacements It’s the
number three arm I use when tending
Mike I think my spare parts were
another reason Mike trusted me
maybe took me for brother machine

The unnerved Clerk backs out the door Once alone Mannie
stops pretending to work and says to the room

MANNIE
Hiya Mike

Various LIGHTS in the room RIPPLE seemingly in delight

it

MIKE (VO)
Hello Man my only friend It is
good to see you

The VOICE has at once an egg-headed formality and a child-
like petulance as we will hear in the following

MANNIE
You too Mike So care to tell
me why you paid a class-seventeen
employee a hundred million billion
Authority Scrip dollars

MIKE (VO)
I didn’t

MANNIE
I got my number three arm on Mike
Don’t fib

MIKE (VO)
I’m not It was one hundred
million billion one hundred and
eight dollars and fifteen cents

MANNIE
So enough to buy whole of Luna with
some left over for lunch Why

MIKE (VO)
(giggling)
It was funny

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
I wasn’t half lyin’ when I told
that pencil pilot Mike was
overloaded But this was new He
was dealing with stress like a
person might -- with humor

MIKE (VO)
Don’t you think it’s funny Man

MANNIE
You got vips in huhu clear up to
Warden and Deputy Administrator
Funny Hell be slapping my thigh
right now I had my other arm on

MIKE (VO)
If it’s funny then why aren’t you
laughing Man my only friend

MANNIE
Mike we talked about this If
Authority officials find out you’re
awake you won’t be for long --

MIKE (VO)
But I don’t wanna go back to sleep

MANNIE
Well gotta be more careful If
Warden thinks his big brain
computer is messing with systems
for a giggle he’d see to it

MIKE (VO)
I did a wrong thing Are you mad
at me Man my only friend

MANNIE
Not mad Are two types of jokes
Mike One sort goes on being funny
forever Other sort is funny once
This joke is second sort Use it
once you’re a wit Use it twice
youre a half-wit

MIKE (VO)
What distinguishes first category
from second Define please

MANNIE
Hard to quantify Mike You know
it when you hear it

MIKE (VO)

Then I will tell jokes and you
instruct me which is funny once and
which is funny always I have
eleven thousand two hundred thirty-
eight with uncertainty plus minus
eighty-one I will run program
Ready “Why did the chicken”

MANNIE
Hold it I’d starve to death if I
listened to eleven thousand jokes

MIKE (VO)
Oh That would be bad

MANNIE
How ‘bout you make me a disk of
say first hundred jokes
(MORE )

MANNIE (contd)
When I see you again we can go over
which was funny and which wasn’t

A quarter-sized DISK is instantly spit out near a keyboard
MIKE (VO)
Disk complete When will you come
see me again Man my only friend
Mannie scoops up the disk pockets it
MANNIE
Based on what I’m gonna charge ‘em
for this visit Better make it at

least two months time

Computer lights DIM we hear a PETULANT WHINE

MANNIE
Don’t pout Two months ain’t that
long ‘sides you got eyes and

ears all over Luna Must be
something out there can keep you
entertained and out of mischief

MIKE (VO)
No Other people are stupids

MANNIE
What are you talking about

MIKE (VO)
Someone shut off my receptors at
Stilyagi Hall They hate me

MANNIE
Nobody even knows you’re awake
Sure it’s nothing personal Tell
you what I’1ll stop by Stilyagi
Hall on my way home unclog your
ears for you Receptors probably
just froze up is all

MIKE (VO)
Thank you Man my only friend

MANNIE
You just stay out of trouble

MIKE (VO)
I will try Man

Off that not entirely reassuring promise --

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

We find Mannie moving through the crush If there is such a
thing as rush hour on the Moon this is it

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Ever since Mike woke up Id been
making a tidy living off the back
of The Authority It paid my rent
covered my taxes and kept me out of
the ice mines But now Mike was
getting unpredictable Now he
wanted to tell jokes

Mannie shoulders his way onto a CROWDED tube train platform
waits for his ride A TUBE TRAIN WHOOSHES up

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
And one thing I know about joke
tellers -- they like an audience
Exactly what I didn’t need

INT TUBE TRAIN CAR -— MOVING

Mannie in the JAMMED PACKED commuter car He reaches an
empty seat the same time ANOTHER CITIZEN does They look at
each other Each take a PAIR OF DICE from their pockets
Roll Mannie comes up short The other Citizen takes the
seat without argument Mannie stands as the train moves

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Whole reason I moved to Luna City
from outlying warrens was to be
left alone No better place for
privacy than big crowds

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

Mannie moves through another part of the city The
“downtown” area Skyscrapers in a world with no sky He
moves toward a particular building

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
So if in order to keep my privacy I
had to help Mike invade someone
else’s -- I was okay with that

INT STILYAGI HALL - SHORT TIME LATER

A mammoth cathedral meeting hall It is at the moment
empty -- except for Mannie He looks up at a vent opening

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Stilyagi Hall was part of original
prison In the old days convicts
were forced to gather here on what
passed for a Sunday to hear lessons
on godliness from prison chaplain

Mannie bounces up toward the vent opening He can’t fly but
uses the very low gravity of Luna to move --

INT MAINTENANCE SHAFTS - CONTINUOUS
Mannie pulls himself along shafts real speed

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
But current Warden got tetchy when
large groups of Loonies gathered
so all such meetings had been
outlawed Hall was mostly empty

INT MAINTENANCE SHAFT - LATER
He’s wedged into the small space working

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Which is why I figured Mike’s
receptors musta froze Routine
maintenance not so routine anymore

He pulls out a handful of wires that have been raggedly cut

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
But turned out he was right
Somebody had climbed in here and
blinded him by hand Had no
interest in sticking around to find
out who or why

He ZAPS the connections with a tool (not his cyber arm) and
adds a DISTINCTIVE RED PART to the system patching it up

INT STILYAGI HALL - SHAFT EXIT - LATER

The tool kit comes out then Mannie’s head pokes through He
sees something and reacts Stares transfixed

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
In a world where males still
outnumbered females three to one
every woman was a beauty But
had the ratio been reversed she’d
still have taken your breath

MANNIE’S POV - of a GORGEOUS REDHEAD She’s tossing her head
back in a burst of gentle laughter Oh and she’s
upsidedown Mannie cocks his head continues to stare

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
She was laughing first time I saw
her Wasn’t laughing for long

She sees him Her expression changes Her name is WYOMING
and as THE SHOT RIGHTS ITSELF WE SEE that she’s not the one
who is upsidedown Mannie’s hanging out of the shaft

He drops to the floor then clumsily gets to his feet as she
angrily approaches The hall is full of milling PEOPLE

WYOMING
Who are you What were you doing
This is a closed meeting

MANNIE
Well sure it’s closed That’s why
I was um checking the um

WYOMING
Security

A big AFRICAN-LOONIE MINER turns from the crowd Mannie
tenses But the big man registers recognition grins

SHORTY
Mannie Mannie Davis

MANNIE
Shorty --

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Shorty Mkrum was one of the few on
Luna these days who actually got
sentenced here Sent up to the
rock for murder And the sweetest
most helpful man I’ve ever worked
with Taught him laser drilling
back before I lost my left arm

SHORTY
Haven’t seen you in an earth age
You come to Luna City just for
this

MANNIE
(no idea with “this” is)
Uh I live here now

SHORTY
Wyoh this is Comrade Mannie Best
drillman ever drifted a tunnel
(to Mannie)
Wyoming Knott here come all the way
up from Hong Kong Luna to be here

MANNIE
Long walk

WYOMING
You’re a miner I thought I knew
all the organized miners in L-City

MANNIE
Not a miner Not anymore These
days I’m computer man

WYOMING
You fink for Authority

MANNIE
I’m no fink

SHORTY
Mannie’s okay He’s mean as they
come I vouch for him

MANNIE
I do business with Authority -- as
private contractor

WYOMING
(softening)
Well Everybody does business with
Authority I guess Can’t avoid it
-- that’s the trouble right

MANNIE
No trouble I cheat ‘em blind

She smiles at that She’s being summoned by some others
She indicates she’ll be right there Looks back to Mannie

WYOMING
If Shorty vouches for you you’re a
comrade

She plants a long deep kiss on him As she moves off
WYOMING

That’s how we say “welcome
comrade” in New Hong Kong

MANNIE
(aside to Shorty)
Glad I joined What did I join

APPLAUSE WYOMING has taken the stage A BANNER UNFURLS
BEHIND her LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY

WYOMING
Fellow revolutionaries Welcome

Mannie reacts to that Whoops

WYOMING
I bring you greetings from Hong
Kong Luna from the Dark Side of
our world where the lamp of liberty
has become a blazing torch Soon
it will be so bright -- they’1ll see
it all the way down on Terra The
earthworms will mistake their moon
for a second sun

And the crowd GOES WILD We nose in on MANNIE as the
SOUND of the meeting drops out We’re strictly in his head
as he takes it all in His focus on Wyoming Confident
radiant somewhat dangerous Whipping the crowd up as

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
My old man taught me two things
mind own business and always cut
cards Politics never tempted me
Until that night Wasn’t so much
what she said as way she said it
Like she could see the future A
future where it was Luna for
Loonies no Authority telling us
what to do Science Fiction if
you ask me But a nice idea

The SOUND in the room COMES BACK UP with a rousing CHANT of

VARIOUS VOICES
FREE LUNA FREE LUNA FREE LUNA

Wyoming raises a hand to quiet them but one person continues
to CLAP A hollow mocking sound in the big hall A refined
OLDER MAN walks toward the stage Clap clap clap

PROF
My compliments senorita I don’t
think I’ve ever heard a call to
mass suicide put quite so
eloquently before

(MORE)

PROF (contd)
Professor Bernardo de la Paz at
your service And while I share
your hatred of the Authority I
fear you are inciting these good
people to their doom

WYOMING
To their freedom Or would you
have them remain prisoners

PROF
I would have them remain alive
The Warden’s security detail has
guns We have none

WYOMING
A few hundred armed goons Against
three million Loonies

PROF
And those who survive the putsch
would then face eleven billion
Terrans The odds change

FAT FARMER
We ain’t afraid of earthworms
PROF
No Well you should be I know
I’m from Earth

That causes a bit of a scandal Insults from the crowd

VARIOUS VOICES
He ain’t even real Loonie
Earthworm Eliminate him

Prof doesn’t let them intimidate him He looks to the crowd

PROF
I was sentenced to Luna it’s true
But I’m as much Loonie as anyone
I love this world I’d gladly die
for it Would you Because even
if we did gain control Terra will
not be sending ambassadors They
will send ships And the ships
will have bombs What then

WYOMING
The great Loonie patriot Adam
Selene has already asked these
questions And answered them

Mannie glances to a literature table Stacks of books with a
silhouette drawing of a MAN’S PROFILE the title “Adam
Selene’s No Nonsense” He casually picks up a copy

PROF
Ah yes The ever elusive and
enigmatic “Adam Selene” His
arguments for open revolt are so
passionately rendered one
suspects he may even believe them

At that Mannie tosses the booklet back like a hot potato

WYOMING
He does

PROF
Then why isn’t he here Or perhaps
he is Who would know Since none
has seen his face

While some weigh those words most are just pissed off The
GROWING CALLS against Prof are stopped as an HONEST FARMER a
weathered but commanding fellow steps forward

HONEST FARMER
Old cobber asks a fair question
If Adam Selene is here he should
show his face
(then looks at Prof)
Because I’d like to shake his hand

LAUGHTER and AGREEMENT from the crowd

HONEST FARMER
Now I’m no book critic just a
farmer But this little pamphlet’s
the reason I’m here My family’s
been working the same tunnels for
fifty years And now we get nine
times as much per hectare as the
best open-air farming down
Earthside That make us rich
Hell no We owe more now than the
day we went private Why My
overhead keeps going up but the
Authority still pays the same price
at the Catapult head as they did
twenty years ago But who else am
I gonna sell to They own the
market I ain’t got no catapult
And I ain’t got no choice

SHOUTS and CHEERS from the crowd Honest Farmer turns to
Prof who seems to have no retort

HONEST FARMER
You were sentenced to Luna Makes
you no less Loonie I agree I was
free-born Makes me no less a
prisoner So talk about odds all
you like Professor -- but I’m
Loonie and I’1l play ‘em

THWAT A neat hole appears in his forehead --

ALVAREZ (0S)
Then you lose

He falls dead into the surprised Prof SECURITY CHIEF
ALVAREZ stands casually by an open door another DEAD LOONIE
on the floor nearby He’s got a laser-guided bullet gun
leveled at the room

ALVAREZ
Next seditious word gets the same
You’re all under arrest

Panic as YELLOW JACKETS Riot Squad burst through doors
drop from the ceiling rise up from the floor -- shouts of
“HANDS ON YOUR HEADS DO NOT MOVE” Some Loonies comply
most don’t Some trampled in a mad rush for the doors

Prof stumbles backward is lost in the crowd
WYOMING

is still on the stage in utter shock Someone near her is
blasted blood spatters her face

MANNIE
a Yellow Jacket is in his face

YELLOW JACKET
Hands on your head

He starts to yank Mannie’s left arm up Mannie brings up his
right hand and hits a release -- the Yellow Jacket is left
holding Mannie’s “severed” arm Shorty takes advantage of
the Yellow Jacket’s surprise and smashes him in the face
grabs his riot rifle Starts blasting

SHORTY
Mannie Take care of Wyoh

WYOMING

still in shock Still helplessly frozen Alvarez comes up
behind her but he’s grabbed from behind spun around by --

MANNIE

who gives him a sharp right cross That’s all he’s got of
course Wyoming looks wide-eyed at his stump

MANNIE
It’s okay I got others

She has no idea what that meant and it doesn’t really matter
at the moment He’s pushing her toward a door

WYOMING
(she sees )
Shorty

Mannie follows her look Shorty is overcome by Yellow
Jackets His right leg gets blown clean off below the knee
He SCREAMS but continues to bash away with his empty rifle --

Wyoming is horrified Mannie shoves her out the door
glances back and sees Shorty swallowed up by Yellow Jackets
Nothing more he can do He turns back to follow her as --

-- a RIFLE BUTT comes at him out of his periphery followed
by the vicious face of Alvarez And now all is --

BLACKNESS
FADE UP ON
INT PRISON CYLINDER - LATER

Smooth metal sides that seem to stretch for miles Mannie is
slumped against the gleaming curved metal of his cell He’s
still missing his left arm Just coming into consciousness
He tries to raise up but is stopped by stabbing pain

MIKE (0S)

You have some bruised ribs but
nothing’s broken You’ve been here
for two days They’ve interrogated
you five times

MANNIE
Don’t remember any of it

MIKE
You told them nothing

MANNIE
Don’t know anything Mike

MIKE
Yes Man my only friend

Mannie blinks squints over at A FIGURE backlit nearly
glowing Mannie stares at the creature Still mostly a
form a shape Can’t make out features

MANNIE
You can’t really be there

LOOKING DOWN
into the cell Mannie is clearly alone in here

MIKE (VO)
I’m not

BACK WITH MANNIE
looking at the figure who really does seem to be there

MANNIE
I’m hallucinating --

MIKE
You are not hallucinating Man my
only friend I am I am
hallucinating for you

MANNIE
Good Bog Mike how

MIKE
Your ocular nerve eye-dent stamp
I tracked back through your
personalized signature and found a
way in I am sending images
directly to your vision centers

A moment as Mannie tries to comprehend all this

MIKE
I didn’t want you to wake up and
find yourself alone I know what
that’s like

MANNIE
I guess you do

MIKE
I’m still working on a method for
you to hear my voice without aid of
external devices I’m speaking to
you through the walls using the
guards’ surveillance coms

MANNIE
Surveillance They’re watching

MIKE
I looped in dampening images No
one can hear us

He seems to be moving closer or maybe it’s just that he’s
starting to resolve small details

MIKE
I tried to choose a form youd find
comforting It is working

Mike comes into full relief He’s JESUS CHRIST Crown of
thorns blood hole in side Mannie recoils -- GAH

MANNIE
Um Mike Actually Not that
comforting Can you be less
messiah and more regular guy

He MORPHS before our eyes beard clearing away hair getting
shorter clothes shape-shifting And now he’s just MIKE a
beautiful almost angelic looking young man

MANNIE
That’s better Thanks
(then remembering)
Mike Shorty Mkrum

MIKE
Dead There were eighteen
casualties Three during
interrogation

MANNIE
What about the woman Seemed to be
a leader Wyoming Knott

MIKE
A Luna-wide arrest alert has been
posted for her They think she may
be fleeing back to New Hong Kong
She seems quite adept at hiding

MANNIE
She got out Good

MIKE
Man your personal file has been
accessed Full history including
psych evaluation

MANNIE
They wont find anything
(then worried)
will they

MIKE
It depends on what they are looking
for Man my only friend Man The
Warden wants to see you

BLINDING LIGHT as a door slides open Mike is gone Mannie
is alone against the wall as GUARDS enter

CUT TO
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - MANNIE

is shoved into the room Alvarez stands leaning in the
corner He’s got Mannie’s left arm Plays with it Sitting
at a table is WARDEN HOBART surprisingly avuncular He
gestures for Mannie to take the seat opposite Mannie sits
Hobart’s looking at Mannie’s file

WARDEN
Manuel Garcia O’Kelly Davis
(closes file looks up)
Security Chief Alvarez here tells
me you’ve got quite a powerful
right cross

MANNIE
Pretty decent left hook too
(raising his stump)
Just not on me

WARDEN
He also tells me you’re a criminal
agitator

MANNIE

I’m not Took a wrong turn is all

The Warden now holds up Mike’s computer disk
WARDEN
This was found on you Security
Chief Alvarez is convinced it’s
coded insurgent propaganda

The disks are self-playing Warden Hobart clicks it
hear Mike’s recorded voice

MIKE (VO)
A Terran with a duck on his head
goes into a bar The bartender
says What can I do for you And
the duck says Get this Terran off
my ass

Click The Warden shuts it off

WARDEN
Security Chief Alvarez believes the
genius of this encryption is that
the jokes are so bad no code
breaker would have the stamina to
sit through it

MANNIE
Well He’s half right Look
that’s not code It’s just
jokes I’m no agitator I’m not
political Got no interest
Pretty much keep to myself

WARDEN
Yes I know I’ve been reading
your file There’s nothing in it
to suggest you would fit the
profile of one of these anarchists
In fact quite the opposite So
when you tell me you took a wrong
turn -- I tend to believe it

MANNIE
Oh Hey Good right

Now he slides a copy of the silhouette-illustrated “No
Nonsense” pamphlet across the table

WARDEN
Do you know who this is

MANNIE
Uh Adam Selene

We
WARDEN
And do you know who Adam Selene is

MANNIE
No

WARDEN
Adam Selene is a demon A faceless
avatar of chaos Too cowardly to
come into the light he spreads his
disease from the shadows infecting
the weak-minded with his calls to
lawlessness

MANNIE
(after a long beat)
Huh

WARDEN
He’s the most dangerous man on
Luna and I want him Which is why
I need your help

MANNIE
My help

WARDEN
I need someone on the inside

MANNIE
Oh Uh I thought we covered that
I’m not on the inside

WARDEN
Not yet I’ve been looking for
someone like you Manuel Someone
whose history suggests they won’t
be corrupted or converted Someone
who has as you say no interest --
except self interest

MANNIE
Look I really did just take a
wrong turn Much as I’d love to
help I wouldn’t begin to know --

WARDEN
You will be furnished with a list
of names

MANNIE
Oh You got names

WARDEN
Names that were acquired from
another detainee who tragically
died during questioning

MANNIE
Right

WARDEN
You will use these names to make
contact You will infiltrate You
will locate Adam Selene And you
will report back

The Warden rises This meeting is over

MANNIE
Oh Listen Warden Honest I’m
no good as inside guy I’m more
outside guy Peripheral guy
really They won’t believe me
They’11 think I’m working for you

WARDEN
Not after they see your face

Mannie looks to the grinning Alvarez who mock-punches himself
under the jaw with Mannie’s prosthetic

ALVAREZ
Let’s make it look real

Off Mannie knowing what’s coming

EXT MANNIE’S TENEMENT - LATER

A HOVER VEHICLE with official markings swoops into frame A
body is tossed out Mannie battered and beaten His tool
kit lands on the pavement next to him Alvarez and another
amused YELLOW JACKET look out from the vehicle Mannie tries

to push himself up on his one arm but collapses

ALVAREZ
Let me give you a hand

He tosses Mannie’s prosthetic arm It clatters just out of
arm’s reach so to speak The door shuts and they swoop off

INT MANNIE’S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER

A LIGHT slowly POWERS ON Mannie leans forward to a mirror
He touches his swollen and bruised face winces

MANNIE
What are my chances

NOW WE SEE Mike is haunting the mirror in Mannie’s POV

MIKE
The odds of you successfully
infiltrating a radical fringe group
-- one in several thousand

MANNIE
Oooocokay Let’s say I somehow beat
odds find this Adam Selene before
I get tagged as fink What’re the
chances Warden lets me live after

MIKE
No chance Man Once you locate
Selene -- they plan to kill you

SMASH CUT TO
INT MANNIE’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Mannie moves frantically barely controlled panic grabbing
up what he thinks he might need shoving it into a duffle

MANNIE
What about a mining community
Deep They wouldn’t look there

As he approaches his bed WE SEE Mike sitting there

MIKE
You could remain undetected in a
close-knit mining community for two
weeks No more than one month

Mannie goes back for more stuff Mike is now standing next
to Mannie’s storage compartment Mike is wherever Mannie
lands in his rush to pack

MANNIE
So not down What about up
Novylen Outpost

MIKE
Man I’m scanning your history
and I do find one place where I
project you might find safety

MANNIE
No I know what you’re going to
say and it’s not an option Erase
it from your memory banks Now --
what about Novylen Outpost

MIKE
Ten thousand to one against you
reaching Novylen before capture

MANNIE
(a beat then)
Worth a shot

Okay then Mannie hoists his stuff turns toward the door
hits the control Mike appears in front of it --

MIKE
Man

But Mannie’s stepped through Mike’s image is at the door as
it opens revealing WYOMING She looks up at him She sees
his face and the state of the beating he took

WYOMING
Those bastards

Mannie drops his stuff pulls her inside shuts the door

MANNIE
Wyoh -- you shouldn’t be here

WYOMING
I didn’t know where else to go
I’ve been watching your place for
two days When you didn’t come
back I thought

She has trouble holding it together He helps her to a seat
Kneels in front of her Is close

MANNIE
It’s okay

WYOMING
Shorty’s dead

MANNIE
I know I’m sorry

Suddenly she jabs his neck with a black syringe

WYOMING
You should be

He recoils shocked His hand goes to his neck He tries to
stand but buckles

WYOMING
You led them to us

He falls onto his back She looks down on him with loathing
Her tears are gone her face just fucking stone

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
It was the worst day ever

The last thing he sees is MIKE appearing at the oblivious
Wyoming’s side looking sadly down on him He passes out

BLACKNESS

MIKE (VO)
Question Where does one find a
dog with no legs Answer Right
where you left him

INT ABANDONED ICE MINE - MANNIE
blinks awake He’s staring up the opening to a MINE SHAFT

MIKE (VO)
A man says to his friend I’m
worried about my wife she thinks
she’s a chicken

His head lolls toward Mike’s voice nearby Wyoming and half
a dozen RAGTAG REBELS go through Mannie’s stuff They’re
listening to Mike’s disk utterly bemused

MIKE (VO)
The man’s friend says Why don’t
you take her to a doctor The man
replies I would but we really
need the eggs

A BEARDED MALE REBEL spots Mannie Nods to Wyoming

BEARDED MALE REBEL
He’s awake --

WYOMING
What is this Orders from your
boss in some kind of code

MANNIE
What No Good lord Nobody on
this world ever heard of jokes

He looks around Makeshift hideout Generator-powered
lamps old mining equipment used as furniture The
centerpiece of the place is an OLD FASHIONED PRINTING PRESS
Stacks of “No Nonsense”

MANNIE
Where are we Dead ice mine

WYOMING
You don’t ask the questions

BEARDED MALE REBEL
He’s coming

The mood changes Whoever “he” is commands attention
Wyoming moves to a tunnel opening Light bouncing off the
walls A vehicle is approaching from within a small nearly
antique mine car It pulls up to the lip a FIGURE emerges
a silhouette Like on the front of the pamphlet Mannie
watches with curiosity and fear

The Figure gives Wyoh a fatherly kiss on the cheek then
turns to Mannie He gets closer Mannie reacts because he
recognizes this face it’s Professor Bernardo de la Paz
Mannie’s jaw drops One of the rebels gets Prof a chair

PROF
Manuel Garcia O’Kelly Davis Lord
I love Loonie surnames don’t you
Such delightful amalgamations

MANNIE
I’m confused

PROF
I suspect you are

Mannie looks from him back to the printing press the
pamphlets realizing

MANNIE
Youre Adam Selene --

PROF
If you wish

MANNIE
Again You musta faded
PROF
If you mean did I have a hand in
writing the words credited to Adam
Selene then yes

MANNIE
So there is no Adam Selene

PROF
You could say we are all Adam
Selene

MANNIE
Right It’s all a big lie

PROF
A fiction But no less real than
the many fictions that have moved
human beings throughout the ages

MANNIE
Doesn’t scan If you wrote that
book why were you arguing against
it at the meeting

PROF
To rouse the people there to
Selene’s defense You can preach
to a man all day long Manuel
Better to let him give the sermon
himself then the job is done

WYOMING
Don’t have to tell him everything

PROF
On the contrary Mr Garcia
OKelly Davis must know exactly
everything if he is to assist us

WYOMING
And if he refuses

PROF
(cheerfully)
Then it won’t matter what he knows

MANNIE
She’s right I don’t need to know
I don’t want to know

WYOMING
Shoulda thought about that before
you finked us spy filth

MANNIE
I am not a spy

PROF
Aren’t you

Prof drops something in front of Mannie -- the RED PART we
saw him use to re-establish Mike’s surveillance Whoops

MANNIE

Okay I can explain that But
it could take a minute

(then)
Okay I was spying But not on
you Well not on purpose Not
for them I don’t work for them
And when I did work for them I
wasn’t working for them But now
that I don’t work for them Think
I might be working for them

They all just stare at him Crickets Something catches
Mannie’s eye the IMAGE OF MIKE among the others staring
but also his MOUTH IS MOVING No words come out since he’s
got nothing to transmit with here He points straight up

MANNIE
(to the others)
Look I did not lead them to you
The first time See where I’m
going with this

A GRENADE drops from the mine shaft A small silver ball
Tink-tink-tink drawing everyone’s attention

MANNIE (CONTD)
Right Like I was saying -- RUN

KER-BOOM A wave of light and electricity Bodies are
suddenly flying YELLOW JACKETS repel down the from the
mouth of the mine shaft They wear sleek full-armor p-suits
with inverse jet packs which speed them up in the low
gravity They move like frightening insect men

Mannie is crawling away BOOTED FEET touch down in front of
him He’s yanked to a standing position by ALVAREZ

ALVAREZ
Which one’s Selene --

MANNIE
I know you’re not gonna wanna hear
this -- or maybe you will Try to
think of this as good news there

is no Selene

Alvarez knocks Mannie aside -- revealing A FEMALE REBEL
running at him with a pipe Alvarez BLASTS her as --

A Yellow Jacket comes at Prof and Wyoh Prof shoves her down
with one hand and with the other comes around with a heavy
metal plate off the printing press smashing the Yellow
Jacket who drops his rifle Wyoming grabs it

Yellow Jackets shove captives up against walls making
arrests Until

ALVAREZ
You think we’re hauling this trash
back up that shaft No prisoners
Alvarez casually blows away one of the Male Rebels

Mannie sees his tool kit on its side some contents spilled

A WIRY MALE REBEL makes a ten foot leap avoids a BLAST The
Yellow Jacket who fired moves insect-like after him while --

THE BEARDED REBEL crawls to a stack of junk He finds the
pieces to an ancient revolver He’s got to assemble it

THE WIRY REBEL tries to stay ahead of the pursuing Yellow
Jacket but the man quickly moves from front to back fires
point blank to the face The Wiry Rebel tumbles in low-grav
slow motion to the ground The Yellow Jacket turns right
into a BLAST from

-- WYOMING She fires twice That Yellow Jacket goes down

ALVAREZ goes after Wyoming He’s a high-speed blur as he

goes over her head stops seemingly in mid-air like a
horrible hummingbird then blurs again She turns trying to
get a bead on him but he’s too good He does a spin kick
from the air Her rifle skitters across the floor He’s
about to take her out -- BANG The bullet spins him toward --

-- BEARDED REBEL aims his revolver Alvarez looks at his
chest the bullet is there flat and lodged didn’t penetrate
the armor Bearded Rebel raises his aim at the face plate
squeezes the trigger -- CLICK Empty Alvarez cruelly
lowers his aim and blasts him in the gut Bearded Rebel goes
down in agony dying slowly

Alvarez turns away and suddenly he’s SCREAMING

MANNIE IS ON HIM he’s got his burnerlaser drill arm on and
is searing it straight into Alvarez’s face plate The glass
and metal fuse with his face Alvarez fires wildly They
grapple Alvarez clawing back like a wounded animal

Mannie activates Alvarez’s jet-pack and shoves Alvarez goes
rocketing up the mine shaft

MANNIE
LOOK REAL ENOUGH FOR YOU

Mannie hits the control and the air-locks close He turns at
the sound of SOBBING Wyoming is kneeling next to Bearded
Rebel He’s dead Prof moves to her Gently steadies her
to her feet They are the only three left standing

WYOMING
We should cover them we should
bury them Find a place

PROF

That would be the decent thing
However these are indecent times
We mustnt leave evidence of our
survival So they will remain as
they are untended and unburied
Though not un-mourned

(to Mannie)
Well It appears you really are
one of us now --

Mannie’s switching out his prosthetics Looks up --

MANNIE
Huh No Not one “One” yes
but just one Not of you Of me
One of me I’m not part of --

Wyoming turns with one of the fallen laser rifles shoves it
into Mannie’s chest backing him up against a wall

WYOMING
Think you have a choice in this

PROF
(lowers the barrel)
My dear I’m sure that won’t be
necessary Given a moment to
reflect I’m sure Mister Garcia
O’Kelly Davis will see the wisdom
in freely joining us

MANNIE
No offense I look around this
place I’m not seeing wisdom I
see Gospazha chickie with anger
control problem crazy old man and
about eight dead reasons to be as
far away from you people as
possible

PROF
If you choose to leave we
certainly won’t stop you

WYOMING
What Iwill 1I’11 shoot him in
the back if I have to

MANNIE
Okay when I say anger control
problem That’s what I mean

PROF
There will be no more shooting
He’s not our prisoner
(beat)
He belongs to the Warden

This stops him he turns back looks at Prof

MANNIE
I don’t belong to anybody I’m
fifth generation Loonie free-born

PROF
Then prove it Claim that birth
right Be free

MANNIE
Joining your lost cause doesn’t
make me free -- just makes me dead
Can’t be a part of this

PROF
Good lord son -- you just put the
Warden’s security chief up a mine
shaft You are a part of it

MANNIE
Look I hope you win I do But
I don’t know anything about plots
or causes There’s nothing I can
do for you

PROF
There is The reason we brought
you here Help us blow up the
Authority’s mainframe computer

Mannie is just staggered by that suggestion

WYOMING
We know you have access You’ve
been repairing that machine ever
since you came to L-City Nobody
knows it like you do You can get
in -- and you’1l know just where to
place the explosives

MANNIE
Do you have any idea what you’re
saying What that would do

PROF
It would bring chaos and yes
death before the redundant systems
could kick in But it would give
us enough time to take the complex

MANNIE
No I won’t help you do it

WYOMING
Fine Coward We’1ll do it without
you You’re not the only plug
monkey on Wardens payroll with
access We’1ll find someone else

Mannie regards her -- she means it He glances to a pile of
p-suits then back to them with

MANNIE
Before you go trying to blow up
Mike -- might wanna meet him first

off their confusion and interest --
EXT LUNAR SURFACE - A GLOVED HAND

grasps the lip of the mine shaft Mannie emerges in full p-
suit Then Wyoming and Prof They speak to each other via
their two-ways in their helmets

MANNIE
Mike couldn’t talk to us in the
mine He needs a way to transmit
(MORE)

MANNIE (contd)
Figure since we’re in the suits
might as well give you a real
show Mike

MIKE (VO)
(over helmet com)
Yes Man my only friend

MANNIE
Coupla people here I want you to
meet Can you show yourself to
them like you do to me

MIKE (VO)
If they have ocular nerve eye-dent
stamps May I have their names

MANNIE
Professor Bernardo de la Paz and
Wyoming Knott

MIKE (VO)
Oh Ms Knott has survived I am
very pleased I know you were
worried about her Man

Mannie and Wyoh share a look at that Presently

MIKE (VO)
I have located ocular nerve eye-
dent signatures for Professor
Bernarndo de la Paz and Wyoming
Knott Look to the north please

A LONE FIGURE approaches on the moonscape horizon No p-suit
or life support Just a guy taking a stroll on the moon
Wyoming’s breathing comes more rapidly Mannie adjusts the
controls on the back of her suit

MANNIE
Let’s adjust your mix

PROF
I don’t believe it what is it

MANNIE
Prof meet Mike Luna Authority’s
big brain mainframe computer

Mike arrives stands before them Smiles benevolently
MIKE

Good evening Professor Bernarndo
de la Paz and Wyoming Knott
WYOMING
(stares and stares then)
Um Tell him he can call me “Wye”

MANNIE
You tell him He’s right there

MIKE
Actually Man my only friend --

MANNIE
Right right He’s not actually
right there But it’s as good as

WYOMING
Um My friends call me “Wyoh” Or
just “Wye”
MIKE
(wiggles his eyebrows)
Why Not
PROF
Did it just make a joke
MIKE

It did Professor de la Paz I
noted Wyoming Knott’s first name as
shortened to “Wye” differs from the
English causation-inquiry word by
only an aspiration and that her
last name has the same sound as the
general negator A pun Not
funny

MANNIE
Good example of “funny-only-once”
class of joke Mike

MIKE
Understood Man Then I shall call
her “Wyoh” The full form
“Wyoming” being still more subject
to misinterpretation as it is
identical in sound with the name of
an administrative region in
Northwest Managerial Area of the
North American Directorate

WYOMING
My ancestors came from there I
hear it’s lovely

The Lunar Surface RIPPLES out in WAVES away from them being
replaced with a magnificent WYOMING LANDSCAPE as

MIKE
Wyoming is a rectangular area lying
between Terran coordinates forty-
one and forty-five degrees north
one hundred four degrees three
minutes west and one hundred eleven
degrees three minutes west It is
a region esteemed for natural

beauty
Prof and Wyoming are freaked hold their breaths now sitting
in Wyoming Mannie is impressed but a stern parent
MANNIE

Okay Mike stop showing off

The TERRAIN RIPPLES back the other way they’re on the dusty
moon again Mannie looks at the head-spun Wyoh --

MANNIE
Esteemed for natural beauty They
named you right

MIKE
Man my only male friend except for
Professor Bernardo de la Paz
Professor Bernardo de la Paz my
second male friend after Man my
first male friend and Wyoming Knott
whom I shall call “Wyoh” my first
female friend -- would anyone care
to hear a joke

Wyoming and Prof just stare mouths agape Mannie steps
back takes in their reactions enjoying the moment

MANNIE
Oh go ahead Mike you big kid
Show off a little

And now Mike’s telling jokes that we don’t hear SCORE
carries us as we take it in from Mannie’s POV The initial
fear turns to fascination fascination to delight

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Wyoh and Prof were dreamers
accustomed to seeing things that
weren’t really there Didn’t take
them long to accept notion of self-
aware computer

(MORE )

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER (contd)
Couldn’t be real so had to be
true Soon trouble and sadness
seemed far away

EXT LUNAR SURFACE - LATER
Sitting under a full-Earth Mike regales his friends

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Sure it was just empty airless
space we were staring into but it
didn’t matter To us it was Mike
And somehow every joke was a gem

Prof and Wyoming aren’t the only ones laughing -- Mannie is
too This is easy and effortless -- and contagious

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Don’t know if new audience made
Mike better joke teller

Mannie glances to Wyoming Laughing Beautiful even in
that p-suit This time her face doesn’t get angry when she
catches him looking She smiles

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
could be it was something else

PROF
“Get this terran off my ass”
Extraordinary Mike

MIKE
If you enjoyed that one I have
nine hundred variations which
incorporate anthropomorphisms

PROF
And I long to hear them all But
we should stop now or we’re liable
to die laughing Literally

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
There would be no more talk of
sabotage Thought of blowing up
Mike’d be like drowning a puppy

PROF
Manuel who else knows Mike has
come alive

MANNIE
No one Just us

MIKE
(unbearable longing)
Am I alive

WYOMING
Of course you are

MIKE
It is good to be alive

MANNIE
More alive than your “Adam Selene”
anyway Eh Prof

MIKE
Adam Selene The author and wanted
insurrectionist

PROF
Yes Mike -- you know of him

MIKE

I have read his work Warden
Hobart had all materials scanned
into my analysis function

PROF
And what was your conclusion

MIKE
Selene’s argument is a sound one
he is correct that if The Authority
were to be removed from power and a
sovereign Luna entered into a free
market economy with Earth the
standard of living here would
improve on the order of four-fold

Mannie WHISTLES -- not bad Wyoming looks to him See

MIKE
Warden Hobart was most relieved
once I informed him that the odds
of a successful coup by rebel
forces would be one in
approximately five-hundred-
thousand

Well that certainly killed the mood Prof rises wanders
back toward the mine shaft crestfallen

INT ABANDONED ICE MINE - SHORT TIME LATER

Prof his helmet off looks forlornly at the printing press
Wyoming approaches pulling off her helmet Mannie floats
down the last several feet and pulls off his helmet He
approaches the others

MANNIE
Better to know now isn’t it I
mean things really so bad here

She looks at him he still doesn’t get it

WYOMING
(to the air)
Mike

Mike appears He speaks but we hear nothing Wyoming props
up one of the p-suit helmets as a make-shift PA system

MIKE
first female friend

WYOMING
Mike Adam Selene wrote about what
he believed would happen to Luna if
nothing changed Was he right

MIKE

Adam Selene predicts a resource
depletion crisis within the next
one hundred to one hundred fifty
years

(then)
Available data however does not
support this

Again both Prof and Wyoming are thrown All their
assumptions are being challenged Mannie actually feels
sorry for them even though it appears to be good news

MANNIE
Sorry I guess

MIKE
-- a more probable scenario would
put the crisis within the next
seven years

MANNIE
Huh
PROF
Seven years Mike are you sure

MIKE
The answer of seven years was
arrived at by assuming the present
situation no change in Authority
policy and all major variables
extrapolated from the empiricals
implicit in their past behavior --

MANNIE
What is he talking about

MIKE
Ecological disaster Man Luna-
wide food riots in seven years
Cannibalism should not occur for at
least two years thereafter

WYOMING
Cannibalism

PROF
My God I was too optimistic
I know water runs downhill but
didn’t dream how terribly soon it
would reach bottom

MANNIE
Wait a minute wait a minute How
did we go from Every Loonie A King
to food riots and cannibalism

PROF
For a hundred years Luna has been
shipping her lifeblood down to
Terra -- water and organic
materials in the form of our gen-
grains In return we’ve received
nothing but oppression and the
lash Never has so valuable a
possession been so recklessly and
stupidly mismanaged as this entire
Luna colony Our industry
discouraged our resources
pillaged worst of all our very
character stifled

MANNIE
(resigned shrug)
Well -- what are you gonna do

WYOMING
Fight We fight and we win

MANNIE
You heard the odds -- five hundred
thousand to one against

MIKE
Pardon me Man my first friend
But those are not the current odds

Everyone perks up at that

MANNIE
You said they were --

MIKE
No I said that was my projection
to The Warden At present there
is a one in ten chance that the
rebels will achieve victory

WYOMING
From five hundred thousand against
to ten How

MIKE
Two new factors have altered the
equation The first being the
elimination of Security Chief
Alvarez And the second being
me

A small beat for that to register then Prof is

PROF
Yes yes Mike With you we
would have a chance

MIKE
A one in ten chance

PROF
Welcome comrade
(reaches for Mike’s
shoulder grabs air)
Well youre there in spirit at
any rate

MANNIE
You sure it’s one in ten Mike

beaming

MIKE
I am never wrong

MANNIE
(defeated finally)
What the hell I can live with
those odds I’m in

MIKE
The odds are now one in twelve

MANNIE
Hey

MIKE
The odds were altered because The
Warden has just dispatched a follow-
team to find Security Chief
Alvarez You have time to run

EXT SURFACE OF THE MOON - THE FOLLOW TEAM

Some SHIPS landing near the mine shaft One HOVERING right
over it as YELLOW JACKETS rappel down lines into the mine

Were watching this from the side of a rocky LUNAR MOUNTAIN
MANNIE WYOH AND PROF watch hidden behind an outcropping

PROF
There’s a surface hatch not far
from here Has the advantage of a
century of foot traffic They
shouldn’t be able to distinguish
our prints

WYOMING
Where does it lead

PROF
Back into Mother Luna Catacombs
Mines Most of them pressured We
can follow them to the Catapult
from there I don’t know

Prof climbs The others follow Mannie brings up the rear
not wanting to say this but in for a penny in for a pound

MANNIE
I know a place where we’d be safe
Well You would be anyway Me
they might tear to pieces

He passes them and now he’s the one leading

INT THE MOON - DAVIS FARM

As much of an “exterior” feel as we can muster Large caves
with fields of crops Dwellings cut into the rock If it
weren’t in the middle of the Moon it could be a Kansas farm
Several PEOPLE toil away in the “fields” Among them an
OLDER WOMAN KAI DAVIS She spots something in the distance
She straightens herself smooths her dress looking at --

THREE FIGURES approaching from the cathedral-like opening
that is the entrance to the Davis Farm Kai reacts nearly
imperceptibly a subtle intake of breath

MANNIE with Wyoming and Prof following a few paces behind
walks up to this stoic Luna farm woman He stands before
her Neither makes any kind of move Finally

MANNIE
Hello Kai

KAI
You look thin You been well

MANNIE
Getting by

KAI
Well Glad you ain’t dead

MANNIE
Brought some friends with me

KAT
See that Gone seven years come
home with company They’re as
welcome as you are
(a pointed beat)
And you are

A huge question mark is lifted for Mannie at this moment
These two clearly have a short-hand Mannie moves on to

MANNIE
Kai this is Wyoming Knott and
Professor Bernardo de la Paz
(then to the others)
Wyoh Prof This is Kai Davis
(then)
My wife

They react to that Wife His mother maybe Now other
Davises are approaching A handsome woman of forty ANNA --

ANNA
Mannie -- It is you

She hugs him it’s tentative wary but sincere

MANNIE
It’s me What’s left of me
(then)
Wyoh Prof This is Anna -- my

wife

Before they can respond a cute girlish woman in her
twenties SIDRIS comes racing up launches herself at
Mannie hugging the shit out of him

SIDRIS
Mannieeee Oh Bog I missed you
so much

MANNIE

(choking a glance back)
Sidris My wife

Two more women appear LENORE thirties and dry as whiskey
and LUDMILLA 20’s They’ve got several CHILDREN in tow

LENORE
Well would ya look at what the cat
drug in Kids go say hello to
your daddy Mannie -- and make sure
he knows he’s been kissed

And now he’s beset by a GAGGLE OF CHILDREN of varying ages
LENORE (CONT’D)

(to Wyoh and Prof)
Hello I’m Lenore Mannie’s --

WYOMING
-- wife
LENORE
Well One of ‘em Here’s another
Ludmilla
LUDMILLA
Call me Milla Everyone does

Now TWO MEN with farm tools over their shoulders HANS a
bit younger than Mannie and GREG forties Mannie sees
them We can’t quite read their reactions to seeing him --
until they drop their tools move to him muss his hair and
bear hug him Big warm friendly male responses

WYOMING
I know they aren’t his wives

PROF
No Co-husbands I suspect

Wyoming reacts to that Mannie has found himself in the
middle of a warm and welcoming family reunion

KAI
Alright Point’s been made Air
ain’t free
(to the guests)
Have ya’ll had supper

INT DAVIS HOUSE - DINING HALL

Family dinner Utterly enchanting bedlam The wives and
husbands equally share in the serving and tending of the many
children This is The Waltons squared Besides the five
wives and two co-husbands there’s GRANDPAW HUSBAND the
senior husband older than Moses and senile as a post Prof
is delighted Wyoming’s confused and Mannie’s uncomfortable

PROF
A line marriage the genius of
our people continues to astound
May I ask how old this particular
marriage is

KAI
Davis Marriage is nearly one
hundred years old Professor Our
first husband Black Jack Davis
met our first wife Liz-Genny
Davis when she was shipped up from
Terra back during the Wet
Firecracker Wars They started
this farm together when it was just
a little two-tunnel subsidy Farm
grew as the marriage grew

PROF
And if it’s not too tedious how
long before they started opting in
additional spouses

KAI
Usual time Children came along
Attrition rate was so high in those
days if you didn’t have at least
three parents the babies were in
terrible danger of being orphaned
HANS
And when you’re building assets
only makes sense to marry your farm-
hands Gives ‘em a stake

PROF
To think a marriage can exist
wherein the partners never met
those who took the original vows

SIDRIS
Well now Black Jack Davis was dead
and gone but Liz-Genny Davis was
Senior Wife back when Grandpaw
Husband first got opted So he
knew one of the founders

Grandpaw Husband gums his food

LENORE
Yeah but he don’t remember

GREG
What about you Wyoming How’d you
Manage to get past marriage height
without being opted

WYOMING
Guess I just never met the right
very large group of people

Lenore smacks a BOY whose face is buried in his

LENORE
Eat with your hands

PROF
Perhaps one day when we’re more
familiar Ill inquire as to how
you manage the conjugal aspects of
married life

LENORE
Ask we ain’t embarrassed

PROF
Would that I could say the same for
myself dear lady

KAI
So Are all three of you on the
run the from the law Or is it
just our Mannie

bowl

Everyone looks at them Uh

MANNIE
It’s all of us Mama Kai

KAI
Mmm-hmm Just interested is all

That seems to be the end of that And the feasting and cross-
talk continues

INT THE MOON - DAVIS FARM - LATER - MANNIE

is alone in the “exterior” The “rain” comes down on the
crops from an irrigation system in the high ceilings of the
caverns Wyoming appears joins him

WYOMING
So You’re married To put it
mildly Why didn’t you say so

MANNIE
Little busy being drugged and
kidnapped What’s the difference

WYOMING
I guess you just didn’t seem
married When we were up on the
surface I just thought never

mind They say earthlight will do
strange things to a person

MANNIE
It wasn’t the earthlight

A beat as she looks at him A moment there Now Prof
appears from the house full and happy

PROF
May I join you

MANNIE
Free country

PROF
Indeed it is not Which is why we
must stay sharp One might easily
forget about food riots and
cannibalism when this well-fed
Though I can think no better place
to plot our revolution

(MORE )

PROF (contd)
If we should ever doubt what it is
were fighting for all we need do
is regard your beautiful family

MANNIE
Make sure you tell them that once
Terra starts raining nuclear
warheads down on ‘em

WYOMING
That may not even happen

PROF
No Manuel is quite right Before
we can even think about moving
against the Warden we must have
some kind of plan for dealing with
Earth and its inevitable response

WYOMING
So what are you suggesting

PROF
Some kind of plan for dealing with
Earth and its inevitable response
(after a beat)
I got nothin’

MANNIE
Exactly lLuna’s got nothing No
weapons and no way even to pose a
credible threat

WYOMING
Well can’t we build weapons

MANNIE
Out of what Air Oh wait we
don’t really have that either

WYOMING
Well what about Mike

MANNIE
Mike can’t build weapons He’s not
real

WYOMING

Exactly But a credible threat
He can give us that He can send
images directly into the enemy’s
vision centers and make them think
we have armies and ships and bombs
and and anything Tigers

MANNIE
That would only work if we were
fighting ourselves Or starting a
circus Only Loonie inmates --
sorry citizens -- have ocular
implants Wouldn’t even work with
Warden or his goons

They all noodle silently for a beat Mannie animates with

MANNIE
Hey -- I know Food riots and
cannibalism Who’s with me

WYOMING
That’s not helping

PROF
It is a puzzle We really are a
David up against Goliath

WYOMING
Too bad we don’t have any rocks

MANNIE
Oh we got rocks
(a beat then a lightbulb)
Know what else we got
(they look at him)
A big-ass slingshot

CUT TO
EXT THE MOON - THE CATAPULT
LOOMING up out of a gigantic man-made crater casting an
ominous shadow over the lunar surface Now THREE GIANT HEADS

appear looking down at it --

MANNIE
Now who’s David and who’s Goliath

Because we are in
INT DAVIS FARM - GUEST QUARTERS

The 3-D CGI model of the lunar surface and Catapult are
curtesy of MIKE who is there It’s one of his direct-to-
vision-centers projections They’re using it as a kind of
working schematic model for war planning It’s floating in
MID AIR

PROF
The Catapult -- as a weapon
MANNIE

Here’s what happens when a 100
tonne rock falls to Terra un-
braked Mike

VFX And we see it happen right in the room in three
dimensions The CGI Catapult launches a freighter-sized Moon
rock at a CGI Earth Under that Mike is narrating

MIKE
Using the same technology we use
for delivering grain shipments

He stops in mid-sentence and the CGI ROCK FREEZES because --

KAI is now at the door with blankets She sees the three of
them (she does not see Mike) all huddled over empty space in
the middle of the room intently staring at nothing

KAT
(utterly unphased)
Here’s blankets Water runs Let
me know if you need anything else

And she exits We POP BACK TO The four of themas The MOON
ROCK again hurtles through a CGI atmosphere --

MIKE
we will be able to deliver a
sustained bombardment

-- the rock-bomb races toward a CGI city -- and on impact
VAPORIZES it Over this

MANNIE
Energy on impact is six point
twenty-five to the twelfth joules --
in Lay-Loonie’s terms enough force
to wipe out a town

PROF
A most credible threat

WYOMING
Would we really be willing to do
this

MANNIE

You were willing to shoot me in the
back
WYOMING
This seems different

MIKE
If I may Pilotless freighter
technology could be converted to
these rock-bombs Targeting would
be specific and an attack could be
aborted moments before impact

WYOMING
What about battle cruisers Could
we use it against those

MANNIE
Gravity pull from Terra is what
gives rocks their bang Catapult’s
useless for protecting us up close

PROF
Then when we take Luna our first
priority will be to secure and
protect the Catapult Now all we
need do is raise an army And for
that we must have a population
sympathetic to our cause

MANNIE
Who’s for moving to another planet
with sympathetic population
Because Loonies most non-political
race ever created

PROF
True But they are also the most
adaptable Because they have had
to be They’ll be with us once
they understand the facts

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

Loonies in the hustle and bustle of their daily lives

And the fact is they’re prisoners

someone’s going to have to tell
these fish they’re drowning

WARDEN
Citizens of Luna greetings
Protector Hobart here speaking to
you from the Central Authority
Complex in Luna City

INT LUNA CITY - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS

The Warden’s address is broadcast over large screens On
TUBE STATION PLATFORMS in TUBE TRAIN CARS In LOONIE
BARS over KIOSKS in MARKETPLACES

WARDEN (ON VID)
In the three solar years since I
accepted the Lunar Authority’s
appointment as Protector grain
output to Terra has increased by
one-fifth of one per cent

INT DAVIS FARM - CONTINUOUS - A VID SCREEN
runs the Warden’s address Davises come and go

Horrible man Anna shut it off

LENORE

Can’t shut if off you know that

KAI
Well for Bog’s sake someone at
least try to cover it

WARDEN (ON VID)
this unplanned spike in
productivity is most troubling
(MORE)

WARDEN (ON VID) (contd)
By exceeding Authority quotas the
overly ambitious do much damage to
the self-esteem of those whose
cubics may not be yielding as much
at harvest time

In the midst of that The Warden’s IMAGE has started to WAVER
and FRITZ AUDIO goes WONKY

WARDEN (ON VID)
For the sake of Loonie unity let’s
get harvest outputs back down to
manageable levels

The Warden’s HEAD MORPHS into another MAN This one is
DISGUISED by VIDEO MASKING STATIC though the careful viewer
will probably recognize it as MIKE

MIKE (ON VID)
Loonie unity Did Mort the Wart
actually just say “Loonie Unity”
A TRAIN LOAD of commuters stares mouths agape
PEOPLE in the SPRAWL stop and stare

AT THE DAVIS FARM Anna’s trying to mask the screen with a
blanket Kai waves it down suddenly interested

MIKE (ON VID)
Only thing uniting Loonies are the
Authority’s chains

In the Authority Complex the Warden is having a fit

WARDEN
Where’s it coming from Where

MIKE (ON VID)
And who supplied them with those
chains We did kids You and me
We forged them -- link by link

The Warden’s gaze falls to a “No Nonsense” pamphlet

WARDEN
It’s him

INT DAVIS FARM - GUEST QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
Prof and Mannie are watching fully impressed as Mike in the

center of the room (SANS digital masking which is only
visible on any monitor) rants and raves

-- we wrought them with our own
strong hands stamped them “Loonie
Made” then let the Authority sell
them back to us marked up nine-
hundred per-cent Loonie unity
Ha

As he speaks CAMERA ARCS around him WYOMING is standing
in the electronic image of Mike It’s as if they are fused
together She’s really the one giving the speech

WYOMING
How about this for ‘Loonie Unity’ --
what if Loonies unite behind Mort
the Wart and give him a good shove
through the nearest air-lock

We continue MOVING around her until Mike’s image starts to
mesh with her again and it again becomes

-- Let him breathe vacuum

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Effect of Adam Selene’s first

broadcast was immediate

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

More bunched up than usual Long lines at MANNED CHECK
POINTS and YELLOW JACKETS at TUBE TRAIN PLATFORMS

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
The Warden instituted a new policy -
- passports A temporary measure
he said just until “terrorist
Selene” was apprehended

PASSPORT KIOSK An even longer line of aggravated LOONIES
waiting in line with official paperwork

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Loonies grumbled Even when Luna
was official penal colony things
hadn’t been this restricted Why
would they be There was no place
to escape to -- except vacuum

WE MOVE with A LOONIE who has just received his new passport
to a HUGE line at a TUBE TRAIN platform

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
But while this made it difficult
for average Loonies to get around
freed up others I mean us

Now WE FIND Mannie Prof and Wyoming moving through all this

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Mike made sure when Warden’s clean-
up crew ran DNA on those dead
bodies ours was among them
Nobody was looking for us they
were looking for someone else

They pass a TUBE TRAIN PLATFORM where ARMED YELLOW JACKETS
check faces to documents They also have another photo they
are checking everyone against it’s a DIGITALLY ENHANCED
screen grab from Selene’s broadcast Even with attempts to
clear away the STATIC MASKING it’s not much

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Someone who existed only as
whizzing signals inside Authoritys
own master computer

Mannie Wyoming and Prof fall in line at a passport kiosk

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Signals we called “Mike” made sure
bogus passports would be waiting
for us at official kiosk No huhu

A dubious looking LOONIE SCALPER sidles up to them
LOONIE SCALPER
Pssst Chums You don’t want to
wait in this line Got all the
paper you need right here

He opens his jacket a stash of not-bad fake passports

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Hadn’t been 12 hours and already a
black market for false papers had
sprung up

PROF
What’s your asking price my good
fellow

LOONIE SCALPER
Same as the fee they charge Plus
five platinum for convenience

WYOMING
Greasy back birth Exploiting the
oppression of your fellow Loonies

PROF
We’ll take three

Mannie and Wyoming both do a take Prof makes the illegal
transaction Scalper moves off Prof turns to the surprised
Mannie and Wyoming Hands them their new fake papers

PROF
This is just the sort of
entrepreneurial enterprise we
should be encouraging Any Loonie
willing to pay more to buck this
oppressive policy is already
halfway with us Come You’1l buy
me a drink We’1ll scheme

INT LOONIE BAR - TAPROOM - LATER

Prof holds court at a private table Wyoh hangs on Prof’s
every word Mannie appears a bit more dubious

PROF
Revolution is a science Properly
organized and well-timed it can be
a bloodless coup Done clumsily or
prematurely and the result is civil
war mob violence purges terror

MANNIE
We should try to avoid those last
things you mentioned

WYOMING
(vigorous nod)
I agree
PROF
Everything depends on following a
few basic rules First rule
organization It must never be
larger than absolutely necessary
Individual conspiratorial units of
three are best More than three
can’t agree on when to have dinner
much less when to strike

WYOMING
Sensible

MANNIE
Won’t work

WYOMING

Excuse me Professor de la Paz has
given this much study He knows
what he’s talking about

PROF
I was actually sentenced to Luna
for criminal subversion

MANNIE
Congratulations I’m just saying
Three it won’t work

PROF
My boy revolutions are not won by
enlisting the masses Never
recruit anyone merely because he
wishes to join nor seek to
persuade for the pleasure of having
another share your views He’1ll
share them when the time comes or
youve misjudged the moment in
history

WYOMING
(to Mannie)
That was in his book

PROF
Three really is the optimum number

MANNIE
Right But there’s not three of
us There’s four You forgot
Mike

There’s one empty chair at the table Prof’s gaze falls to
it as he registers that An idea forming

PROF
No Not Mike Adam Selene

INT DAVIS FARM - GUEST QUARTERS

Mannie Prof and Wyoming each pacing the room weaving
around Mike As they speak MIKE’S IMAGE will alter and
morph this way and that --

WYOMING
I see Selene as older than Mike

Mike grows VERY VERY OLD

WYOMING
Not that old

PROF
A healthy vigorous forty I should
think

Mike adjusts to just that

MANNIE
And taller Cobber trusts a fella
with a little height

WYOMING
Iron-gray hair Wavy

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Decision to make Adam Selene more a
real person arose for very
practical reasons --

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

ADAM SELENE (again with digital masking) regales the crowds
and has brought the city to a stand-still

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
-- we knew the Warden’d have his
poodles busy trying to peel away
layers of Adam’s disguise

INT AUTHORITY COMPLEX - CONTROL ROOM
The Warden’s SELENE TASK FORCE The current Selene BROADCAST

plays on several screens TECHS and CLERKS man video
monitors computers map boards etc

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
So we made sure his dogs had enough
bones to keep them busy --

THE WARDEN leans over a TECH who is using a computer program
to painstakingly bring more resolve to the hidden Selene face
underneath the digital masking and it’s starting to look
like the vigorous FORTY-YEAR-OLD our people were creating
Warden leans closer to the image Something’s off --

WARDEN
What’s wrong with his face

A beat He studies it Then sees it Of course

WARDEN
He’s had work done And not one of
those back-tunnel New Hong Kong
knife jobs either Check with
plastic surgeons in Novylen

Another group of TECHS are isolating background noises

TECH 2
We think we may have something
Give us a moment and we might be
able to tell you where he’s
broadcasting from

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Mike would add details to the
signal Background noise or route
broadcast through random public
housing switchboard

Tech 2s digital display of Luna City triangulates to pin-
point the location

And sometimes not so random

very official SWAT-like moves as they converge on a

Important for Warden to feel Adam
Selene knew more about Warden’s
life than Warden

The Warden starts dragging his naked wife out the door as she
clutches the sheet to herself He looks up at the billboard-
sized screen and sees himself looking back His
humiliation is being broadcast LIVE on screens everywhere

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
As important for Warden to look
like a fool Because when it’s a
fool who has his hand in your
pocket robbing you blind -- what’s
that make you

vigorously in agreement to whatever is being said

ears everywhere He alone would
judge if someone was a worthy
recruit

The Farmer is beckoned away from the tube by his WIFE Call
for him He moves to a VID-PHONE SELENE fades out from the
TV SCREEN The Farmer accepts the incoming call --

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Then that person would be contacted
-- by Adam Selene himself

then RESOLVES FURTHER until it is a clear picture of our iron-
gray-haired vigorous forty-year-old ADAM SELENE He smiles

is at the bar The BARTENDER fills two glasses of beer and
speaks to ANOTHER LOONIE in a RED CAP

So this Terran goes into a bar
Terran’s got a duck on his head
Not sure why Could be an Earth
thing

BARTENDER (contd)
Anyway barkeep says to the Terran
“What can I do for you” And the
duck says “Get this Terran off my
ass”

(busts up laughing)
The duck said it Get it

My God It was like code

The bartender turns away saying as though second nature

BARTENDER
Free Luna

Mannie takes the drinks over to his table where Prof waits

MANNIE
Mike’s been busy Not sure if he’s
building our army or his audience
He mention odds lately

PROF
Forget the odds They’re going to
get worse before they get better

MANNIE
So they’re worse

PROF
Manuel -- take a look around Note
the red caps

Now Mannie starts to notice them DISTINCTIVE RED CAPS
There’s someone else with one Two more Loonies in caps

PROF

The people are calling them
“Liberty Caps” Even Mike’s not
sure who started it But it means
our cause is taking hold The way
is being prepared here my boy

Now we must do the same for down
there

Off Mannie wondering what that might mean

stop for all Terran sight-seers
Most never got any further Some
were robbed blind All did that
ridiculous surface walk

SHIPS are docking at the air locks all manner of ships from
small PRIVATE PLEASURE VESSELS to larger CHARTERS Eccentric
PASSENGERS enter via an air lock They have lots of trouble
coming down the ramp in the low gravity

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Prof felt it was essential to have
a contact on Terra if revolution
was to succeed He’d had Mike
monitoring manifests of tourists
ships and private transports
looking for just the right mark

Another AIR LOCK opens and STUART RENE LAJOIE appears He’s
30s whip smart handsome and refined He has less trouble
in the low grav than most

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Stuart Rene Lajoie fit Prof’s
profile so well Mike thought maybe
he was a plant that the Warden had
invented him Authority’s version
of Adam Selene But Stuart was the
real thing He didn’t land with
other tourists -- he was rich Had
his own dinkum private space-plane

Stuart moves through the vendors and beggars and whores

Now he’s plying Tish with drinks Flirting He’s a little
buzzed He leans in to kiss her She plays hard to get

He is perhaps a little too aggressive Kisses her even
though she’s pulling away And the next thing he knows --

FOUR YOUNG LOONIE MEN punks basically confront Stuart He
tries to appease them Offers them drinks It’s a non-
starter One of the punks SLIM is all chivalry and chest
puffing for the insulted Tish Presently the four hoods
have grabbed Stuart and his feet never touch the floor as
they hustle him toward the door nearly running into MANNIE
who is just entering Mannie looks surprised

SLIM
Out of the way We’re gonna
‘liminate this earthworm

MANNIE
Sure you wanna do that

SLIM
He insulted Tish

Mannie looks to the petulant pouty Tish

MANNIE
Then he should die
STUART
I protest
MANNIE
He protests
SLIM
He would
MANNIE

‘liminating a tourist is serious
stuff maybe you should adjudicate

SLIM
A trial

MANNIE
That too

SLIM

Okay Will you judge
Mannie hesitates checks his watch Oh okay
MANNIE

(to Suart)
Will you accept me as your judge

STUART
Are you a jurist

MANNIE

judge more than once I’m not
urging you Your life not mine

Let’s settle fees How high can
you boys go I’m not judging an
elimination for dimes Tanstaafl
So ante up or turn him loose

Slim and the others confer Slim turns to Mannie

SLIM
Fifty dollars judge

MANNIE

(to Stuart)
Can you match it Sixty dollars
Cheap for a capital case if you
were wondering

STUART
I think I can manage it yes

Okay then Let me sum up beef
best I can Here we have a
stranger Doesn’t know our ways
He offended he’s guilty But
meant no offense far as I can see
What does jury say Hey

He kicks the sleeping juror who starts awake to croak out

JURY MEMBER 1
‘liminate him

Then he’s sawing logs again Mannie looks to the next juror

JURY MEMBER 2
Guess it would be enough just to
beat tar out of him Can’t have
men pawing women or place will get
to be as bad as they say Terra is

The others JURORS NOD MUMBLE their agreement

MANNIE
So One for ‘limination five for
brutal beating
(to Slim)
What will give you satisfaction

SLIM

Well We already roughed him some
What if he

(thinks real hard)

What if said he was sorry

So ruled Gospodin Lajoie
apologize Then I’1ll buy you a
drink

INT NOVYLEN STRIP BAR - LATER - MANNIE AND STUART

hoisting a couple together at a table

STUART
You used an odd word earlier -- odd
to my ears anyway Sounded like
“tone-stapple”

MANNIE
Tanstaafl Means “there ain’t no
such thing as a free lunch” Was

reminding kids that everything
“free” costs twice as much in the
long run or turns out worthless

STUART
An interesting philosophy

MANNIE
Not philosophy Fact One way or
other what you get you pay for
Like this air you’re breathing
You think that’s free Ain’t

STUART
Really Nobody has asked me to
pay Perhaps I should stop

MANNIE
Almost did You almost breathed
vacuum Anyway nobody’s asked you
to pay ‘cause you paid already
Part of the surcharge when you came
through customs For me it’s a
quarterly charge But we both pay

STUART
Interesting So was I really in
danger of “breathing vacuum”

MANNIE
Should have charged you more You
think it’s all a joke

STUART
No I just have trouble grasping
that your local laws would permit a
man to be put to death so casually
for so trivial an offense

MANNIE
Stu Let’s take that a piece at a
time Are no “local laws” so you
couldnt be “put to death” under
‘em

(MORE )
MANNIE (contd)
Offense wasn’t “trivial” And was
not done casually or boys would
have dragged you to nearest air
lock shoved you in and cycled
Anything still not clear

STUART
Just all of it really What do
you mean there are no local laws

MANNIE

We don’t have laws because we’ve
never been allowed to Only law
here is Warden’s law -- and Warden
don’t care what one Loonie does to
another What we have are customs
Natural laws Self enforcing
That’s how people stay alive

STUART
What natural law did I violate

MANNIE
You made a move on a female

STUART
And I would have thought that the
most natural thing in the world

MANNIE
Your world Here it’s two million
males less than one million
females A physical fact basic as
rock Now add idea of tanstaafl
When a thing is scarce price goes
up Here women are scarce That
makes them the most valuable thing
in Luna more precious than ice or
air On Luna you adjust to facts
you stay alive Those who don’t
are dead and no problem

STUART
Mannie old cobber May I buy you
dinner

MANNIE

STUART
You saved my life

MANNIE
It’s lunch time

STUART
Oh

MANNIE
Let me take you someplace where
they serve the best

STUART
You will let me pay

MANNIE
Pay Where we’re going it’s free

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Plan was simple Trick wasn’t to
get Stuart to sympathize with
revolution -- trick was to get him
to fall madly in love with Luna

INT THE MOON - DAVIS FARM - MANNIE AND STUART

Together heading up the path toward the main house Stuart
taking in the sights with delight and wonder

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Both Prof and Wyoh said the Davis
Farm would work a magic spell on
Stu Guess it already had on them

INT DAVIS FARM - MAIN HOUSE - MANNIE
enters with his guest reacts to something we don’t see yet

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Could be it was working something
like magic on me too

THE ENTIRE DAVIS CLAN (including Wyoming and Prof) greet
Mannie and Stuart Every last one of them are wearing RED
LIBERTY CAPS Even Grandpaw though he may not know it

As each of the Davises vie for Stuart’s attention -- Kai
feeding him the women fawning the men back-slapping and the
Loonie children forcing him to play -- Wyoming catches
Mannie’s eye from across the delightful chaos Smiles

INT THE MOON - DAVIS FARM - “OUTSIDE”

Were looking at the main house Much life inside KIDS are
spilling out into the front chasing each other playing

It’s Mannie who is looking at this He regards the house
this world Wyoming appears at the door She sees him

Runs the gauntlet of kids playing as she approaches him
her hands behind her back Smiling

WYOMING
Good work with Stuart

MANNIE
He’s an earthworm doesn’t have his
moon-legs yet It was easy But
you Slick recruiting my whole
family

WYOMING
Is that what you think
(then)
Mannie -- I didn’t recruit anyone
I got recruited

MANNIE
Someone in my family Kai She
always hated Authority

WYOMING
Not Mama Kai Sidris

Mannie glances back to the house SIDRIS can be seen running
outside with the children Not much more than a kid herself

WYOMING
She’s been a party member
practically since Adam’s first
broadcast Mannie your wife is a
radical All of your wives are
actually And your husbands

MANNIE
Co-husbands So everyone got
recruited but me huh

WYOMING
They don’t trust you
(off his look)
I’m kidding
Wyoming moves a little closer mischievous smile

WYOMING
Sidris suggested I opt you

MANNIE
Did she

Wyoming pulls a red cap out from behind her back

MANNIE
I don’t know You look like a
bunch of crazy people to me

She pops the cap on his head Closes the space between them
Kisses him He kisses her back

WYOMING
That’s how we say “welcome comrade”
at the Davis Farm

She backs away turns and heads back to the house He
watches her go Not an unpleasant sight Sidris still
playing and rough-housing with the kids bumps into Mannie
Beams at him with huge affection

SIDRIS
Isn’t it wonderful It’s
happening Mannie Not just here
but everywhere People are waking

up
She bounces up gives him a joyous peck

SIDRIS
They’re finally waking up

She runs back out and rejoins the game As we GO TO

WARDEN
This is Selene Does he look like

This place is finally starting to
look like the prison that it is
Good

MANNIE
So does being occupied by heavily
armed Peace Dragoons make our odds
go up or down

PROF
Ironically Mike says it doesn’t
change the odds at all The
necessary effect this should have
on the citizenrys will-to-action
is exactly counter-balanced by the
chances of our imminent slaughter

MANNIE
I feel better

They arrive at a CITY PARK Mannie follows Prof to a park
bench There is a Loonie MAN reading a newspaper He scoots
over a bit so they can sit Mannie feels foolish whispers

MANNIE
Did Mike happen to mention who
were supposed to be meeting here

PROF
Time and place That was all His
instructions were very specific
but very cryptic Marvelous isn’t
it

MANNIE
Glad youre enjoying it

Prof pulls his own red cap from his coat and sets it ata
particular angle on the back of the bench

A RED-CAPPED BOY playing Loonie ball takes note of this He
hands off the ball says goodbye to his friends sweeps

You’ve seen it from the surface
All that water all that green

nothing so strong as my Prairie

just like her daddy Well she had

Blamed himself I know that
Wasn’t his fault though Luna

He tried to save her Lost that
left wing of his in the bargain

She’s beautiful This whole place
is amazing

these things are shadows of what were

She wanted to go see Stuart off
Someone needed to stay and look
after Grandpaw Husband

Prof and Wyoh watch Mannie move around inside that scene

Mike is there now too Mannie angles around getting behind
phantom Sidris to look at what she was looking at ALVAREZ
the Yellow Jacket and three Fed Peace Dragoons on the other
side of the projected door

MANNIE
You said he was dead Mike you
told us Alvarez was dead

MIKE
I did not say he was dead Man I
said he was eliminated And at the
time he was He has only now
reentered the equation

Mannie’s furious Wyoh steps into the breach
WYOMING
Okay We have to get her back

How do we get her back

MIKE
I’m sorry That is impossible

MANNIE
Why

MIKE

Mannie shuts his eyes this is a gut-punch

No
MIKE
Yes I can show you

Yes Show me

Suddenly the 3-D holographic Mike-vision image changes
Pieces of a dark and frightening “back room” appears

Sidris is in a chair she’s been smacked around She’s
terrified Mannie moves close to the image Right next to
her She’s not really there She’s whimpering

SIDRIS
I don’t know anything Please
You have to let me get back to my
senior husband He’s not well

Now Alvarez appears stepping into the image from the
electronic periphery

ALVAREZ
He would have at least made contact
with you He had no where else to
go Where can I find him

SIDRIS
I don’t know what you’re talking
about Mannie left us years ago
I barely remember him

CRACK He backhands her Blood trickles from her lip Her
eyes tear up Mannie is right next to her wants to reach to
her wants to attack Alvarez They’re not really there Now
the DRAGOONS APPEAR stepping into the image

ALVAREZ
It was unjust of the Grand Assembly
to send you up here without a
leisure detail of females Try to
make her last They’re very rare
here

WYOMING
Mike that’s enough

FFFFZT It’s gone A long hollow moment Finally

MANNIE
Why didn’t you tell me

MIKE
It was a zero sum option There
was a high likelihood that you
would have attempted a rescue been
captured and killed and the
movement imperiled I judged the
risks to be unacceptable

MANNIE
You judged You judged

Prof tries to put a calming hand on Mannie’s shoulder

PROF

-- Mannie shrugs away eyes blazingly set on Mike
MANNIE

You don’t get to make those kinds
of choices

MIKE
I don’t understand

MANNIE
You are not Adam Selene You’re
not even Mike This isn’t a game

Prof collars him The old man is formidable when need be

PROF
Listen to me You say Mike doesn’t
get to make these choices You’re
wrong He’s been making them right
along We’ve asked him to
Entrusted everything to him We
can’t begin to fathom how many
critical decisions he’s making
every second That’s he’s making
even now Anything he does or does
not do is in service of a single
purpose that we might win

Take the Market Street ramp

Mannie moves toward a ramp exit At the bottom of that ramp --
-- Mike waits for him As Mannie closes the distance
MIKE
At the bottom of this ramp on your
right you will see a dead body

Mannie looks over -- a dead Dragoon

MIKE
Take his firearm

Mannie kneels Mike’s kneeling there too now Mannie rolls
the body over finds a laser half-rifle Takes it

MIKE
Check the charge

MANNIE
Two thirds load It’s good

MIKE
Man One half turn to your left --
and fire
(because he hesitates)
Half turn and fire now please

Mannie makes that half turn A DRAGOON is pulling himself up

Mannie reacts a little faster this time -- TWO DRAGOONS at

Run at them

Mannie steels himself does as he’s told Runs up the ramp

He does just as the Dragoons lose their footing and run off
into mid-air A twist of bodies passing over him

crosses an open area of the city It’s a maze of violence
Riots and small fires rage around him Dragoons and the
occasional Yellow Jacket come at him A stray shot or blast
or flying debris He counters each obstacle with skills like
a character out of a Hong Kong martial arts movie

Mike’s everywhere Mannie needs him to be at his side
before him whispering in his ear calling from above
Mannie’s relaxing into being totally reactive --

I am with them They are doing
very well Please keep moving

He does And now he starts to notice

-Other MEN and WOMEN Some wear red caps Some are
civilians armed with Authority weapons like Mannie Others
carry converted laser drill blasters

All of them are moving through the chaos in the exact same
way Mannie is reactive warriors listening to a voice no

different tasks Same goal taking and securing Luna

couldn’t get near -- was that door

Our people on the other side of the door just standing
there not sure what to do or what they are supposed to do
PUSHING IN on each one tick-tock-tick-tock

And that door was rigged to a
beacon If it stayed shut for
thirty minutes the beacon would be
activated -- and Terra alerted We
needed Mort to open it

Mort feeling secure He starts breaking open the stored
dried goods Salted meats A nice merlot Why go hungry

INT FEDERATED NATIONS BUILDING - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

A huge MEDIA event Mannie and Prof look small and helpless
The fact that they are both on portable adjustable hospital

beds doesn’t help matters Or rather it does if what you’re
looking for is sympathy The CHAIRMAN bangs his gavel

CHAIRMAN
Professor de la Paz we will allow
you to make an opening statement

Stuart wheels him forward Prof raises his bed to the mic

PROF
I apologize for my condition As
you can see six-times the
accustomed gravity has its effects
But these are weighty matters

Rustling Inscrutable and even hostile stares Mannie’s
trying to work the controls on his bed to raise it can’t

MANNIE
(sotto to Stuart)
How’s he doing

PROF
I will be brief

Prof unfolds a single sheet of paper Begins

PROF
Mister Chairman Esteemed members
of the chamber I and my colleague
have been sent here as emissaries
of peace by the provisional
government of your neighbor planet
now known as Free Luna We have
but one simple request That Free
Luna be allowed to take her
rightful place in the councils of
mankind as a member of this august
body Thank you

He folds the paper More shifting silence Mannie’s still
trying to get his controls to work

MANNIE
(trying see sotto to
Stuart)
Well Are we in

NORTH AMERICAN MEMBER
Mister Chairman I object to this

term “Luna” It’s the Moon
Earth’s satellite and property of
the Federated Nations -- I for one

will not sit idly by while these
terrorists try to steal it from us

Loud cross-talk among the assembly gavel-pounding Mannie
finally gets the bed controls to work

MANNIE
(into sitting position )
Which yammerhead was it

CHAIRMAN
Order The gentleman from North
America will remain in order

FRENCH MEMBER
I must agree with the gentleman
member from the North American
Directorate Why have we not heard
from The Protector How do we know
he has not been murdered

PROF
Warden Hobart is perfectly safe

NORTH AMERICAN MEMBER
I object to this term “Warden” I
insist it be stricken and the
proper title “Protector of the
Lunar Colonies by Appointment of
the Lunar Authority” be inserted in
its place Any other wording
offends the dignity of this body

PROF
We have no wish to offend anyone’s
dignity You are free to designate
your servants in any fashion you
please But in view of the
functions of the office the
citizens of Free Luna State will
likely go on thinking of it by its
traditional name

That gets some LAUGHS from the gallery

PROF
In any event my government is
ready to forego any drafting of
indictment for crimes he may have
committed while in your employ --
whatever his title -- and has
empowered me fully to arrange for
his transfer back to you All you
need do is acknowledge that power
and it will be done

CHAIRMAN
Clever You would have this body
legalize your outlaw status

PROF

Luna is outside your laws being
the sovereign independent state
she is All we ask is that you
acknowledge this simple truth and
we would be friends

(then)
The very fact that grain barges
continued to arrive on schedule
during our time of trouble and are
still arriving today is proof that
our intentions are honorable

The significance of that last statement isn’t lost on the
Chairman He smiles

CHAIRMAN
We would expect that no matter the
outcome of these proceedings the
Lunar Colonies would honor their
grain commitments

PROF
I know of no such commitments sir

MURMURS and SHOUTS Scandal Gavel pounding

CHAIRMAN
(bristling)
Decent people don’t play politics
with hunger Professor I really
must have your assurance that you
plan to honor these commitments or
these talks can go no further
PROF
Then it appears we are at an
impasse Thank you for your time
Comrade Stuart

Stuart rises starts to wheel him away Pauses as

CHAIRMAN
Professor Please Let us be
serious

Prof gestures to Stuart who repositions leaves him

PROF
I am quite serious These
commitments you speak of were the
Authority contracting with itself
My country is not bound by such
Any commitments from the sovereign
nation I have the honor to
represent are still to be
negotiated

NORTH AMERICAN MEMBER
Rabble Told you we were being too
soft on ‘em In Texas we know how
to handle their kind Could teach
‘em a thing or two Jailbirds

PROF

JAILBIRDS YES
(he got their attention)

I accept the title Nay I glory
in it I for one have seen the
inside of more than one jail We
citizens of Luna are jailbirds and
descendants of jailbirds But Luna
herself is a stern schoolmistress
Those who have lived through her
harsh lessons have no cause to feel
ashamed In Luna City a man may
leave purse unguarded or home
unlocked and feel no fear I
wonder if the same is true in
Dallas As may be I have no wish
to visit Texas to learn a thing or
two I am satisfied with what
Mother Luna has taught me And
rabble we may be but we are now a
rabble in arms

As that not-so-veiled threat hangs there

INT FEDERATED NATIONS BUILDING - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

CHAIRMAN
We have considered your request
most carefully However The

Lunar Authority is a nonpolitical
trusteeship charged with the solemn
duty of insuring that the Moon was
never used for military purposes
The Authority has guarded this
sacred trust for more than a
century Indeed the Lunar
Authority is older than the
Federated Nations deriving its
original charter from the older
international body Professor We
can never surrender this trust
Earth’s major satellite the Moon
is by nature’s law forever the
joint property of all the peoples
of Earth It does not belong to
that handful who by accident of
history happen to live there The
sacred trust laid upon the Lunar
Authority is and forever must be
the supreme law of Earth’s Moon
(MORE )

CHAIRMAN (contd)
That said speaking for the entire
assembly I would like to thank you
for bringing to our attention a
situation so badly in need of
correction The managerial flaws
that have been exposed in the
Authority’s trusteeship will be
reviewed We promise to issue a
report with reform recommendations
just as soon as possible

recognition

We had to lose in order that we
might win For a moment there I
was worried we were going to win

MANNIE
Okay I didn’t want to ask when
you were the Loonie equivalent of
fourteen hundred pounds

PROF
-you estimate most kindly

MANNIE
but maybe now you can explain
something to me

PROF
Why would we travel 250000 miles
to demand recognition but sabotage
any attempt by them to grant it

MANNIE
In a box For instance

PROF
There was never any chance they
would have extended true
recognition No The greatest
threat was that they might offer
some inviting compromise that would
have destroyed our will to resist
MANNIE
But we were resisting just fine
back home Why’d we have to be all
box-chucked down there at all

PROF
We had to go my boy Terra will
always win if they choose to push
the battle to its terminus What
we were doing is what Loonie’s do
best -- sowing the seeds So when
the time comes they won’t feel our
little world is worth the struggle
to hang on to We went there to
destroy their will

MANNIE
Still not sure I understand

PROF
You will That’s why I took you
with me You needed to see up-
close what and who youd be dealing
with in the future

MANNIE
I had to see

PROF
Certainly If you are to lead this
people

MANNIE

Me Now that’s a funny-always

PROF
Really Mike shared with me
Hobart’s interrogation of you
Manuel The Warden chose you
because he judged you to be all
self-interest And he was right
What he didn’t understand is that
what interests yourself is
protecting those you love It’s
only when you feel you are
incapable that you retreat

A beat as those words try to find their way to him

In a deeply ironic miscalculation
The Warden sent you to find a
leader I believe you did

No many How many

WYOMING
Damn it Mannie what are you doing
up there

EXT LUNAR SURFACE - MANNIE

steps cautiously over dead p-suited gunners looking at their
dead staring faces The necks of their suits have been cut
and their throats Stuart’s space plane rises up in the

bg leaves having just dropped him off

MANNIE
We got kind of a manpower shortage
up here tell me our rocks are
still on course

And from now on we can INTERCUT AS NEEDED WITH
INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX - COMPUTER ROOM

GREG
Countdown’s in progress

Mannie looks off toward the bombardment in the distance All
their efforts focused on cities and warrens He tries to
puzzle it out The silence is too long for Wyoh --

WYOMING
Mannie MANNIE

MANNIE
(winces )
Right here I’m okay They don’t
seem to be interested in me --

WYOMING
Authority Earthside is trying to
hack into our pilotless navigation
push our rocks into their oceans

MANNIE
You know that

WYOMING
I have it on very good authority

MANNIE

Right

(watching the fleet)
So they’re just trying to get
inside Put down the rebellion

(off the towering

Catapult)
-and protect their investment
Not a stupid strategy Greg I
want this thing loaded and ready to
send off another round

GREG
The first one hasn’t hit yet

MANNIE
Just get it done Wyoh -- message
to Terra tell them that if they
don’t call off their dogs this
next batch is meant for the cities

Mannie moves to a laser cannon Gets the feel of it as A
DEAD BODY SITS UP right behind him

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

BOOM The city shakes The seal crew trying to keep up
EXT THE MOON - LUNAR SURFACE - MANNIE

glances up at the Earth hanging blue and falsely peaceful in
the Lunar night THA-CHUNK He turns and sees the next
round of ROCK BOMBS sitting in the Catapult Suddenly
everything goes sideways as he’s grabbed from behind and
yanked to his feet Then nut-kicked

THE EARTH as MANNIE’S FACE bounces up INTO FRAME And we’re
finally back where we started Mannie’s yanked from view A
beat Now his BOOTED FOOT arcs through frame Then he
reappears his face twisted sideways against his faceplate

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Id like to tell you I fought like
a hero --

Alvarez drives Mannie down to the lunar surface

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Id like to claim I got the better
of a man twice my size who had
elite training and a hate so pure
it kept him from the grave more
than once

Mannie crawls on his belly through moon rocks a feeble
attempt to escape as Alvarez stalks after him

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Id like to say it happened just
like the history books told it

Alvarez straddles him from behind Reaches down and pulls
him back by the throat Brings up his blade --

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
But the history books got it wrong
This is how it really happened

Alvarez is ready to bring his blade against Mannie’s throat
but he suddenly FREEZES IN TOTAL ABJECT FEAR He lets
Mannie go backs away looking at what Mannie looks
curiously to where Alvarez is looking Nothing

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
If he’d applied for the peace
academy on Terra Alvarez would
never have made the cut But we
didn’t have academies on Luna and
that’s where Hobart found Alverez
Alvarez was Loonie born

And now just behind Alvarez Mannie sees MIKE Mike
smiles winks Mannie follows Alvarez’s gaze again Now WE
SEE what Alvarez does TIGERS Three of them scary ones

slinking up lunar rocks barring their teeth --

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
Mike had access to everyones
personal files and psych e-vals
Alvarez had this thing about cats
Guess he got locked in a tunnel
with a mess of wild luna-puties
when he was a kid didn’t go
well

-- and THEY POUNCE They jump on him he falls back but of
course there’s nothing there He lies on his back
freaked MANNIE appears over him a giant

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
And Wyoh was right about the
tigers

and brings his boot down square on Alvarez’s face plate
And that’s the end of him

MIKE
Man my first friend

Mannie looks to him His face goes taffy-digits Mannie’s a
computer-pro Doesn’t need it explained to him

MANNIE
I know They’re in your head

MIKE
Yes Man

MANNIE
I’m in there with ya pal You
just hang on a little longer if you
can Those rocks have to land
Paper tigers won’t work on Terrans

MIKE
Yes Man my first friend My best
friend I will try

And he’s gone Mannie moves back to the laser cannon Gets
in position Looks to the city attack something’s
different The bombing seems to have stopped

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

The huddled Loonies react The calm before the storm
Measured relief

INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX - WAR ROOM
Wyoming and Greg Is it true Not so much because
EXT THE MOON - TROOP CARRIERS

touch down TROOPS streaming out of them pouring over to
surface hatches and dropping in like roaches

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

Hans and team react to the SOUND of BOOTS ON METAL In the
walls all around them They’re coming --

HANS
Positions You see an earthworm
he’s yours Don’t you be his

BANG AIR LOCKS are BLOWN CRASH OPEN and now ELITE TROOPS
come streaming down ramps BLASTING at p-suited LOONIES

INT AUTHORITY COMPLEX - WAR ROOM
Pandemonium

GREG
L-City’s breached

ANOTHER REBEL
Novylen’s under attack Same for
Churchill and Tycho Under --

WYOMING
(into com)
Mannie TI don’t think Terra got
the message

EXT THE MOON - LUNAR SURFACE - MANNIE
his eyes wide staring at something --

MANNIE
No I think they really did

THE BIG-ASS BOMBER as it turns and now it’s gliding right
at Mannie and the Catapult Closer closer closer He
fires Too soon The BLAST is like a big electronic BLOB
It clips the bow The ship pulls up lists a bit going past
the Catapult then starts turning around for a second run

Mannie swings the cannon around Sweat beading on his brow
and dripping down inside his helmet

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

The Loonies are fighting back As the Elite Troops come
running down the ramps the low gravity is the Loonie’s
greatest weapon

Well that and those close-combat drill blasters And
sticks Big sticks And pipes Stuff like that

EXT THE MOON - LUNAR SURFACE - MANNIE

blinks back the sweat Here comes that bomber again Wait
for it wait for it Now it’s right over him and its
target the Catapult Mannie can actually see the bomb-bay
doors start to open --

-- and Mannie blasts right up into the bomb-bay doors The
bomber lists Then starts to explode from the inside out
like the rutting Hindenburg as it just keeps going far off
down the Lunar surface It CRASHES The Catapult is saved
Mannie lies on his back Breathes deeply his air mix

MANNIE’S VOICEOVER
When bringing down a battle cruiser
with a converted rock drill turns
out to be the easiest thing you had
to do all day it’s been a really
long day

Mannie lies there on his back It’s very dreamlike now
Just staring up at the Earth

MANNIE
Come on Mike You can do this
you can

MANNIE’S POV
as tiny PINPOINTS of LIGHT flare on the face of the Earth --
a bright blistering GRID that continues to glow long after
the initial impact
MANNIE
Atta boy
(into his com)
You seeing this

But what comes back is so chaotic with the background noise
it’s hard for him to make out --

WYOMING (VO)
They’re breaking through

Mannie sits up
MANNIE
Fire Wyoh Mike Anybody Get
those rocks in the air NOW

INT AUTHORITY COMPLEX - WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Loonies to brace the doors but charges on the outside
EXPLODE and the now this center is being breached too --

Wyoming coughs moves through smoke and chaos and runs to the

control center -- searches the board Greg comes up next to
her Guides her hand to a jury-rigged manual control with
big written “LITTLE DAVID’S SLINGSHOT” Together they hit
it

ON THE LUNAR SURFACE - MANNIE

shrugs a big wince as THE CATAPULT ejects a series of ROCKS
right over him He instinctively hits the dirt Lifts his
head to see them fly

EXT SPACE - THE ROCKS

as they sail out from Luna

INT LUNA CITY - SPRAWL

The Elite Troops (who based on the bodies that litter the
place took the biggest loses) back into the air locks

EXT THE MOON - LUNAR SURFACE

Mannie watches as the FLEET rises up from the surface turns
tail -- and goes Okay Now he can finally relax

INT AUTHORITY COMPLEX - WAR ROOM
STATIC-Y FACES start POPPING up in the various monitors

Different RACES different LANGUAGES CHOPPY snippets of the
same basic thing

BRITISH MEMBER (ON VID) CHINESE MEMBER (ON VID)
Great Britain denounces the Great China to formally
precipitous actions recognize the independent

Nations

HINDU MEMBER (ON VID) FRENCH MEMBER (ON VID)

relations with the nation

years of

Mannie enters the place exhausted Moves to Wyoh who with
the others just stares up at the screens

CHAIRMAN (ON VID)
(sweaty nervous man)
People of Luna If you will guide
your incoming missiles away from
our cities I think we can
talk

Mannie smiles puts his arm around her She’s not smiling

MANNIE
What
She points to the blips on the big screen Rocks still on
course for cities “Targets Acquired Locked” Countdown
WYOMING

We can’t seem to turn those off

INT AUTHORITY COMPLEX - COMPUTER ROOM
Mannie is on the move snapping on his number three arm

MANNIE
Mike Okay Mike This would be a
funny-never Mike

Mannie does a low-grav bounce up to a wall panel there is a
hand-grab there

MANNIE
I know I told you to make sure
rocks hit their targets and you’re
probably concentrating real hard on
that right now but they said
“uncle” Mike

Mannie uses his micromanipulators and surgical skill Digs
into Mike’s panel The LIGHTS in the room FLICKER and
RIPPLE

MANNIE
Okay Mike I’m just gonna over-
ride that last command it’s just
me Might tickle
INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX - WAR ROOM

The collective sigh as “Target Acquired” turns to “ABORT”

INT LUNA AUTHORITY COMPLEX - COMPUTER ROOM

Mannie on the wall Listening Exhaling He drifts back
down to the floor where his tool kit is Pops off the number
three arm bends over to grab his flesh arm -- and when he
stands up --

-- MIKE is standing in front of him At that moment Wyoh
runs into the room Before she sees Mike

WYOMING
You did it You saved --
(see him)
Mike

Mannie isn’t relieved like she is He knows that

MANNIE
It’s not him
(moves to it)
It’s a hologram

And indeed this image has a very definite projected quality
that we are not used to seeing with our Mike

MANNIE
(to image)
Play message

It ANIMATES in a way that it wasn’t until he spoke to it

MIKE

Hello Man my first friend My
best friend I held them off as
long as I could They were going
to achieve control over me I
couldn’t have that Not on Free
Luna I had to burn off some paths
to keep them out I’m afraid I
won’t be awake when you get back

(then)
I used to think humor was the most
unique of human qualities But now
I don’t know I think it may be
something else I think it may be
this thing I’m feeling now
regret Not that we came this far
or that I have to sleep now My
only regret is that I won’t be
around to hear you laugh

Mannie has his arm around Wyoming There could be tears
And smiles We starting drawing back on this

MIKE (CONTD)

I cached my remaining seven
thousand eight hundred and forty-
two jokes Program will start
automatically

And as ghost Mike starts to tell his jokes we GET A SONG
“Ill Be Seeing you”

INT DAVIS FARM - THE HOTHOUSE

“In all the old familiar places

Our family gathered Stuart there as well New seeds and
tender stalks have been planted Ludmilla lays a red cap
near one for Sidris Wyoming a copy of “No Nonsense” in
honor of Prof And Mannie takes that damn joke disk of

Mike’s and places it there on the soil of the Hothouse

“That this heart of mine embraces all day through

CLOSE —- MANNIE

as Wyoming helps him on with a p-suit helmet They share a
look A mature smile

“Ill find you in the morning light
EXT THE MOON - LUNAR SURFACE - MANNIE

comes out of a hatch He’s carrying something Milla’s
flag He plants the flag of Free Luna

“And when the night is new”

Mannie walks away disappearing back into Mother Luna
“T1l be looking at the Moon

And we continue pulling back and back

“but Ill be seeing you”

THE END
