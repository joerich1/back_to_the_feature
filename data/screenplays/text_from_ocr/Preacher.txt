UNDATED DRAFT
INT BAR - NIGHT

CASSIDY sits at the bar with a glass of beer packet of
Camels in front of him beside his change one lit in his
hand Bar noises behind him - jukebox music conversation
Occasional glimpse of people passing by behind him Smoky

atmosphere We stay
down the empty glass

on him as he knocks back the beer sets
smiles wryly

CASSIDY

Piss And not enough of it

The BARMAN picks up the glass Cassidy draws on his

cigarette sits back

Hell now tell us the story as if we

were sitting at the bar beside him so he wont always be

looking right at us

CASSIDY

So where was I Oh aye the
Preacher Well before I get stuck
into this youd better get it

straight
story

that this is no ordinary
Ordinary story is boy meets

girl boy gets girl up the stick

father f

orbids boy to see girl but

true love wins through audience
pukes its ring the end Or maybe

bad guys

kill helpless innocents

head bad guy with English accent

prepares
Arnie Sc

to take over the world
hwarzennegger kills everybody

in sight girl shows us her tits
everything blows up the end

The barman sets down

a fresh beer Cassidy is pleased

CASSIDY

But this ones different Just about
as different as you can fucking get
to tell you the truth Jesus I was
smack in the middle of it and even I
dont believe half the fucking things
that went on There was angels
Demons Rednecks Gunslingers from
beyond the grave Fucking vampires
would you believe There was a boy
with a face that looked like your
arsehole and a woman who was braver
than any man I ever met and a man
who stood tall in front of Heaven
itself and faced down the power of
God

He sips his beer looks thoughtful smiles a bit

(

CASSIDY
You wouldn’t know to look at me but
Im ninety-seven years old I
thought Id seen it all But you
wont have to see too much of this
one before you realize what I did
that absolutely fuckin anything can
happen anytime That there arent
any rules to this That youre
entering the one hundred percent
bugfuck maniac Geoffrey Dahmers-
running-down-Broadwaywith-John Wayne
Bobbitt s-dick-in-a-bucket-of-napalm-
zone and any attempt to understand
it is gonna make your arse turn
inside out Its a love story Its
a horror story Its a violent
story

He thinks for a moment trying to find the words Then he
relaxes

CASSIDY
It started in church

EXT ANNVILLE NIGHT

Starting from out in the Texas desert we move slowly in
towards the few lights of ANNVILLE Getting closer we
realize were in Hicksville the ass-end of nowhere A main
street with a few smaller ones off it We move past a bar -
just some low light not much noise Looking down a side
street we see two DRUNKS supporting each other for the
stagger home Further on a quick look down an alley reveals
movement the sound of breaking glass A sheriffs dept
cruiser passes us going in the opposite direction Moving
across the town square we see another DRUNK passed out on a
bench with a vile-looking DOG raping his unconscious leg

We move slowly towards the church a simple wooden building
just outside town on the opposite side to where we came in
A light is on within and as we get closer we hear raised
voices a mans and a womans

INT CHURCH - NIGHT
The church is an old building as simple within as without

Just rows of pews facing a lectern on a raised platform
Large black cross on the wall

The REVEREND JESSE CUSTER stands in front of the platform

uncemfortable

TULIP
Youre a Preacher A fucking
preacher Jesse I cant fucking
believe this It took me so long to
find you I knew you had to be mixed
up in something crazy but

JESSE
Tulip I know this has gotta be kind
of upsetting-

TULIP
Yes Id say its pretty fucking kind
of upsetting You walk out on me
without a word of warming you leave
me high and dry in Phoenix with
twenty-seven dollars to my name and
now after three years of searching
the length and breadth of Texas I
find you and what are you doing
Youre worshipping fucking God

JESSE
Aw now dont say his name like that-

TULIP
Excuse me Im just a little bit
pissed at him at the moment Ill
say his name any way I want I mean
what the fuck is going on here’ I
expected to find you running hash
over the border or running a goddamn
strip joint or that youd just gone
back to the good old GTA I
expected to find you banging that
skinny slut from Waco whatsername
But instead youre a Preacher an
honest to fuck man of God andthe
only thing youre banging is the
Bible Now what in the name of fuck
is that all about

JESSE
Honey-

TULIP
And another thing just exactly how
does an ex-car thief qualify for the
fucking Ministry anyhow Theres no
way youre telling me the church has

Facing him is TULIP OHARE angry and amazed

TULIP (CONTD)
©) started embracing the kind of shit
that we used to get up to

JESSE
It wasnt all that bad-

TULIP
It wasnt Christ Jesse there are
people from New Orleans to San Diego
still wondering what happened to
their fucking Ferraris The Jesse
Custer I remember could hot-wire the
Space Shuttle blindfold used to put
bourbon in his coffee because
“sugars for fags and liked to fuck
all day and all night till the sun
came up again Now I dont recall
learning too much of that kind of
thing in Sunday School but if thats
what Christians are into these days
then please tell me where do I sign
up

They look at each other for a moment Jesse unsure of what to
do Tulip exasperated Then she calms a little

e TULIP

Just tell me why

JESSE
eel cant

TULIP
What do you mean you cant

JESSE
I mean I cant tell you why I left
you to become a Preacher I made a
promise to someone someone real
important to me I had to do right
by ‘em

TULIP
(hurt taken aback)
But what about me Jesse Didnt you
care about doing right by me

JESSE
Oh Jesus honey Of course I did I
justI thought youd get over it
find someone else

(
3 (3

a TULIP

You were my dream Jesse How did
you think I was gonna get over you
All that time we spent running cars
into Vegas or Austin or San Antone
and I used to look at you and say
“Hes really mine”

(pause)
And you used to look at me and say
youd love me until the end of the
world

JESSE
(miserable)
I know I know But it cant ever
be that way again

TULIP
Why not

JESSE
I told you I made a promise I
never went back on my word to anyone
an’ if I was to start doin it now I
figure I wouldnt be worth a good
goddamn

She stares at him quietly stunned He looks back at her
sad but determined There it is She puts a hand to her
face Jesse reaches out to her concerned

TULIP
(furious recoiling)
Get off me Goddamn it do you have
any idea how much you fucking hurt
me

JESSE
I guess not

TULIP
Puck you You and your fucking macho
bullshit You throw everything we
had down the toilet for some fucking
promise to do a job you know is
bullshit Well the hell with you
Jesse Custer You make such a big
deal about how you never lie or go
back on your word and oh no you
never did-

(vicious)
Except to me

She turns and stomps out furious almost tearful The
miserable Jesse can only stand and watch her go

The door slams behind her and Jesse is left alone He slumps
back into a pew as low as he can go upset and a little
angry-

JESSE
Shit

He turns towards the lectern Below the open Bible on top of
it is a little shelf hidden from the view of the
congregation On it are a nearly full bottle of Jack
Daniels a silver Zippo and several packets of Marlboros

INT CHURCH - NIGHT

Jesse sits alone smoking a Marlboro taking long slow pulls
on the bourbon Hes taken his jacket off loosened his
collar About a dozen cigarette butts lie stubbed out on the
pew beside him He has a surly look about him pissed off at
the world in general and the shitty hand dealt him by fate
He stares resentfully up at the big black cross behind the
lectern Hes turned all the lights out except for a little
one on the lectern that illuminates the Bible Lots of
shadows He raises the bottle again swigs it Only half-
full now Jesse drinks bourbon the way normal people drink
water

INT BAR - NIGHT

Flashback A slightly YOUNGER JESSE wearing black T-shirt
and jeans strides confidently through a crowded bar with a
pretty if skinny dark-haired GIRL on his arm The place is
jumping dark and smoky a rough crowd getting good and
drunk Light comes mostly from neon beer signs As he
passes us a face in the background swims into focus the
YOUNGER TULIP seeing him for the first time liking what she
sees

Jesse leans back against the bar sticks a cigarette in his
mouth surveys the bar with mild interest as his girlfriend
searches her purse for a lighter To Jesses slight
surprise a womans hand comes into view from his other side
lighting his cigarette with a silver Zippo By the time his
girlfriend has come up with her own lighter its too late
The girl turns startled to see Jesse staring into Tulips
eyes as she closes the Zippo smiling knowingly back at him
Zing Instant connection

INT CHURCH - NIGHT 6

Jesse takes another pull on the bourbon head leant back
against the pew

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY 7

A long stretch of road running through the middle of nowhere
under a vast blue sky A bright red convertible Ferrari
suddenly tears past a sheriffs dept cruiser easily doing
120 mph Huge dust cloud behind it

INT FERRARI - DAY 8

The younger Jesse and Tulip Hes driving grinning
enjoying her attention as she laughs in delight A quick
glimpse of the cruiser disappearing in the dust behind them
as she leans over to him and they kiss smiling all the
while

INT CHURCH - NIGHT 9

Another swig for Jesse We move a little closer each time

EXT DESERT - NIGHT 10

Younger Jesse and Tulip making love on the hood of the
Ferrari lying in their own discarded clothes Beautiful
night in the desert towers of rock rising in the background
sky full of stars As we move closer they finish kissing
each other deeply Jesse looks down at her and they both
grin exhausted but happy

Jesses pov Tulip smiling up at him happy loving This
is his sweetest memory of her bathed in starlight A long
moment ’

INT CHURCH - NIGHT 11

Another swig Barely any whiskey left He looks miserable
for a moment saddened

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR NIGHT 12

Younger Jesse comes charging down the hospital corridor
desperate running past various curious DOCTORS and

(

oo

12

ORDERLIES He rounds a corner enters a room freezes in
alarm Nearer us a DOCTOR and a couple of NURSES turn to
face him The doctor has a sympathetic look

INT CHURCH NIGHT 13

Jesses pain takes on a bitter edge as he grits his teeth to
retain control

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 14

Jesse sits alone in the darkened hospital room staring at
the floor face in shadow Behind him an ECG and various
monitors are turned off As we pull back we realize theres
a body in the bed sheet pulled up to cover the face We
pull back further and fade out

OMITTED 15
OMITTED 16
INT CHURCH - NIGHT 17

Jesse raises his head and we see that anger is replacing
sadness as he stares up at the cross bitter and resentful
He gets angrier with each passing second His lip curls into
a snarl as he stands and flings the empty bottle with all his
might It shatters into a million pieces against the cross
The sound seems huge in the enclosed space - then it fades

EXT CHURCH - MORNING 18

Lovely day A pickup truck pulls up and parks Then a
battered car pulls up alongside it More engines can be
heard too

INT CHURCH - MORNING 19

Jesse lies across one of the pews asleep in his clothes
Bright light floods in through the windows He slowly raises
his head bleary-eyed Not looking too good Hair tousled
unshaven red eyes clothes dishevelled He grimaces as the
hangover makes itself known Slowly he becomes aware of the
engine noises outside

Then he freaks

19

JESSE
Oh fuck

EXT CHURCH - MORNING 20

About a dozen cars and pick-ups - none in very good condition
are drawn up in front of the church some still parking
People family groups mostly are making their way towards
the door Jesses congregation has arrived

INT CHURCH - MORNING 21

Jesse rushes desperately about attempting to kick the broken
glass and cigarette butts under the pews do up his collar
pull on his jacket straighten his hair and slap himself
awake - all in five seconds

JESSE
Sunday It would have to be fuckin’
Sunday
EXT CHURCH - MORNING 22

The folks head for the church door The guy in front reaches
to push it open
INT CHURCH - MORNING 23
Jesse stands in the aisle between the pews as the light from
the open door falls across him He looks a little bit
cleaner but not much He plasters on a fake smile and
fights hard to look as cheerful as possible
JESSE

Mornin
EXT EARTH ORBIT DAY 24
The GENESIS entity tears past us a flaming white comet
plunging towards Earth which lies below like a vast field of
blue
INT CHURCH MORNING 25

The congregation have taken their seats and Jesse stands at
the lectern leaning on it as he gives his sermon

25

JESSE
«e-and thats what Jesus was trying
to tell us when he did these things
that God his Father in Heaven will
forgive us our sins no matter what
they might be

Jesse really isnt looking well The hangovers kicking in
but good Hes sweating He runs a hand through his hair
blinks a lot to try to concentrate

JESSE
But we have to ask him for that
forgiveness

His congregation is not particularly inspiring material
Maybe 20-25 people all staring dully back at him or at the
floor bored KIDS look out the windows A couple of FAT
GUYS a STRINGY-LOOKING WOMAN an OLDER GUY WITH NO CHIN a
FAT KID picking his nose

JESSE
And we have to mean it when we ask
or his forgiveness is rendered
pointless We cant expect to sin
and be forgiven all throughout our
lives God can forgive us our sins -
but its up to us to accept his
forgiveness and his love and live
from that point on without sin as
best as we are able

Jesse stifles a belch swallows hard sweats tries to smile
and look like a guy whos got the inside scoop

JESSE
What we cant do is come to church
every Sunday an‘ say a few quick
prayers and then sin as much as we
darn well want for the rest of the
week

As he continues we focus on one of the fat guys in the
congregation again - hes asleep Then a BORED TEENAGE BOY
looking down his SISTERS cleavage Then the nosepicking
kid and the huge booger hes hauling out of his nostril
Jesses voice begins to falter

JESSE
That ain’t the way it works folks
The Lord wants a commitment from
usand

(

i

»
ea)

Jesses eyes narrow as he peers down at them

JESSE
And uhhe wants a promise of
faith

The nose-picking kids booger slides out of his nose stuck
to his finger Its a biggie all right all green and
snattery Jesses face falls in weary disgust

JESSE
Because thats how

He clams up and we see the anger returning to his face A
moment passes

JESSE
Aw fuck it

That gets their attention

EXT CHURCH - MORNING 26

The ugly leg-raping dog from the previous night meanders past
the church then looks up to the sky High in the blue above
theres a flash of bright light a distant crack of thunder
then a faint descending glow

INT CHURCH MORNING 27

The congregation gapes at Jesse transfixed He rants at
them red-faced and furious spitting hate Hes like some
evangelist on PCP as he pours out his frustration

JESSE
You bunch of dull-eyed fucks You
stupid worthless inbred
cocksuckers You sit there like a
buneh of fucked-to-death zombies
while I spout this fucking bullshit
at you - you think I do this for fun
You think this is your goddamned
entertainment Im supposed to be
looking after your fucking shitty
spiritual welfare here and all you
do is sit on your fat redneck asses
and stare back at me ‘til I feel
like some kinda zoo animal on
mongoloid visitin day Well fuck

doin’ exactly the kind of shit I was

Harve Collins I could feed half of
India on the grants you get for that

JESSE

stallion Kate or were you just

HARVE
I’ve never seen this woman before in
my life -

But JESSE has moved on to a SPOTTY YOUTH in the back row

Moving on to
plate bolted

JESSE
Mark Bannon Ate dogshit for a dare
last Saturday night What the fuck

a DOZY-LOOKING GUY in the middle with a steel
across his nose and then the petrified nose-

28 EXT CHURCH - MORNING 28

The dog is barking now - the white glow in the sky has grown
gotten nearer becoming the fiery white comet we saw before
Genesis Its on a collision course with the church

29 INT CHURCH MORNING 29

The congregation is muttering now as they stare at Jesse not
pleased He seems to be building to a climax

JESSE
I pray for you you know that I ask
God to help you see the way you act
is wrong I ask him to help me show
you whats right But it’s been two
years now and you assholes are just
as fucked up as you always were And
all I can conclude is that the good
Lord is using my prayers to wipe his

ass
This is too much Most of them get to their feet Several
shouts The fat guy snarls
FAT GUY
Fuck you Custer We never asked for
you
JESSE

(to the skies)
So you tell me God ‘cause youve
got all the fuckin answers you tell
me what Im supposed to do here
Tell me how the good people of
Annville Texas figure in the grand
design You bust me up with a girl
so perfect I could live a hundred
lifetimes an‘ never meet another like
her an’ you send me to this
worthless fuckin shithole so I can
minister to all these goddamned
throwbacks - so come on Lord Give
me a sign Give me some
incontrovertible evidence that the
Almighty aint got His head shoved
firmly up His ass

A sudden explosion of light The door flies apart Before

anyone can even turn to look the Genesis comet charges into
the church and right at Jesse His eyes bulge in amazement

( )

29

The comet comes at him in slow motion a white hot ball of
light trailing fire A beautiful angelic mans face appears
in the light screaming soundlessly It changes instantly to
an equally beautiful but demonic disturbing womans face
also screaming

Then it hits Jesse no longer in slow motion Another burst
of Light then hes hurled backwards against the cross The
comet disappears Jesse falls to the ground in a heap The
congregation stares then they turn to each other
bewildered

FAT GUY
What the fuck was that

CHINLESS GUY
What the fuck’s up with the Reverend

Jesse is suddenly flung into the air and hangs there limbs
jerking and twitching eyeballs rolled over white sparks and
smoke coming off him A vast figure is glimpsed in the smoke
and lights around him - first with huge wings that flicker
and disappear then with cloven hooves and long curved
horns A distant rumbling

The congregation stares riveted but terrified

Then the smoking and sparking stop as does the noise The
figure disappears Only Jesse is left hanging there
apparently unconscious

EXT CHURCH - MORNING 30

A sudden blast of white light from within Terrified
screaming A pause - then the windows shatter outwards and
the roof explodes into the sky The building shakes boards
flying loose from the wall but the structure just about
holds The white light flares up and out filling the
screen

EXT MOTEL - DAY 31
Tulip gloomily dumps an overnight bag and her purse into the

passenger seat of her pick-up truck She takes a last look
around Annville finds nothing inspiring gets in

INT TULIP’S PICK-UP DAY 32
She sits there for a moment gloomy then examines her
veflection in the rear view Sad girl She pulls her

lipstick out of her purse giving us a quick glimpse of the

32

357 Desert Eagle concealed therein and turns back to the
Mirror She squints at it curious Her eyes widen as the
view behind her suddenly disappears in a white flash Tulip
freaks instinctively ducking down in her seat The pick-up
rocks back and forth When Tulip sits up again the
whiteness has gone and the view is back to normal - except
for a pall of smoke rising on the other side of the town

Tulip is stunned almost to silence horror building in her

TULIP
Jesse
She starts the pickup
EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET DAY 33

Several people are stumbling into the street to stare at the
rising smoke They scatter as Tulips pick-up charges down
the street through them

INT TULIPS PICKUP - DAY 34

Tulip guns it scared but determined

EXT CHURCH - DAY 35

The church is a wreck The four walls are still intact but
not much else Black smoke pours from within Tulips truck
screeches to a halt She jumps out and runs into the church

The legraping dog has been reduced to a blackened skeleton

INT CHURCH DAY 36

Despite the smoke the church isnt actually on fire The
walls are badly holed the roof is gone the place is a soot-
stained wreck - but as Tulip discovers picking her way
carefully through the rubble the smoke is coming from the
remains of the congregation Their scorched skeletons lie
sprawled over the pews or flung back into seated positions
little fires burning inside the ribcages flesh burnt clean
off the bones A hellish scene

Tulip advances shocked fearful of whats yet to come She
coughs a bit wafts the smoke aside She passes the skeleton
of the nose-picking kid sitting stupidly with a bony finger
jammed in its nasal cavity The she turns to us catches
sight of something stifles a gasp Jesse lies sprawled
across the little platform at the front burning pages from

36

the Bible fluttering around him His face is smeared with
soot his hair tangled his clothes scorched and filthy
Unconscious Tulip rushes to him terrified

TULIP
Aw no-

She feels for a pulse frantic then smiles with infinite
gratitude and relief Jesse stirs a little grunts Tulip
looks round at the ghastly remains of the congregation then
down at Jesse Shes thinking fast very wary

TULIP
Jesus Christ Jesse What are you
into

She gets an arm under him hauls him up

EXT CHURCH - DAY 37

Tulip shoves the unconscious Jesse up and into the back of
her pick-up straining with all her might She seems pretty
agitated ready to be off She opens the passenger side
door grabs a blanket from under the seat As she closes the
door she notices several townsfolk making their way towards
the church

TULIP
We really have to be going

She stretches Jesse out hurrying and spreads the blanket
over him Then she climbs into the truck starts her up and
speeds off ’

EXT DESERT - DAY 38

Miles from anywhere Ominous stormclouds hang low overhead
Rumble of thunder A sudden duststorm blows right at us
surrounding us totally

Way back in the swirling dust a figure can just be made out -
weirdly transparent at first dust whipping through it It
moves towards us all the while getting more solid as it
moves closer Thus arrives the SAINT OF KILLERS

As he gets closer we can make out details the flapping
duster coat wide-brimmed hat hiding his face He strides
towards us then past us an unstoppable quality to his gait
as if he’s been going forever and nothing gets in his path
He keeps his head lowered so we never see his face but we
get a glimpse of a holstered pistol a gnarled hand The
dust howls around him as he passes - then hes gone

EXT CHURCH - SUNDOWN 39

Two sheriffs’ dept cruisers have pulled up outside the
shattered church A couple of DEPUTIES keep an eye on the
small crowd watching from the edge of the town Two more
stand outside the church with a taller figure SHERIFF HUGO
ROOT A pair of FORENSICS GUYS come and go from the church
to their car parked near the cruisers

HUGO
Ask me I reckon it was niggers

Hugo stands with hands on hips squinting meanly at the
church - pretty much the way he looks at everything He
spits from time to time With him are DEPUTY FOSTER a fat
guy and DEPUTY KENNY a younger guy who clearly doesnt
think too much of his sheriff - and in fact has doubts about
the mans sanity

KENNY
How you figure that Sheriff Root

HUGO
(spitting)
Kinda thing they do

KENNY
What burn a church full of folks
clear down to the ground Scorch all
the flesh off of them They do that

HUGO
Martian niggers Kenny Come down
from space to abduct white folks
Take ‘em away make ‘em do all kinds
of sexual shit Even experiment up
their asses with probes

Hugo doesnt notice Kennys doubtful look simply because he
rarely bothers to look at whoever hes talking to He just
bangs on with the air of a man one hundred per cent certain
of his subject He rarely gets rattled or hurried the
sourness inside him curdles at its own easy pace

HUGO
Government an the FBI they know
shit they aint tellin us Got an
airforce hangar with a spaceship an
a dead Martian Nigger inside ‘cept
they dont reckon were ready to know
about it yet

(

KENNY
That pick-up seen headin’ away from
here - none of our eyewitnesses said
anything about coloured people

HUGO
Dont have to be coloured if theyre
from Mars Kenny You ever read that
book Communion

KENNY
Cant say I have Sheriff Root

HUGO
Fella in that knew all about ‘em
‘Cept he got the wrong idea
(patting the 44 magnum in his
belt holster)
Only Communion your Martian Nigger
understands is the kind I got right
here

Deputy Foster shouts from one of the cruisers where hes on
the radio

We can hear it crackling

FOSTER
Sheriff Root Sheriff Meeker says
hes got you the chopper an marksman
you requested but he wants you to go
talk to some media people -

HUGO

(unfazed)
You tell him fuck you

(spitting)
You tell him Hugo Root says fuck you
Tell him I want that chopper up here
now an to keep them media fucks
away or Ill send ‘em back in
bodybags

KENNY
Sheriff Root You figure maybe the
way these people been blasted to
goddamn bones we oughta wait for
some real back-up before we go
lookin for ‘em

HUGO
We got air support an’ snipers an
half a dozen roadblocks bein’ set up
right now Kenny You ain’t goin
weak sister on me are you

( )

2 39

KENNY
(peeved)
All Im sayin is it could be more
than we can handle here -

HUGO

It could be Im gonna take me a big
shit tomorrow an’ find the keys to
Graceland in the bowl but I kinda
doubt that as well

(spitting)
Martian Niggers Kenny

(strolling off)
You wait an see

And Kenny is left fuming quietly

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT 40

Run-down place beside a desert road no other buildings
about The night is still Tulips pick-up is parked at one
of the pumps and shes filling the tank She finishes
leans over to look at Jesse anxious He doesnt look good
at all - sweating fidgeting in his sleep face twisting

TULIP
What am I doing with you
(pause)
I must need my fucking head examined

She pulls the blanket tighter around him takes her purse
from the drivers seat heads off to pay

Out on the edge of the gas station a scruffy-looking guy
pads out of the desert night stops to survey the station
Tulips pick-up catches his eye Its Cassidy tired but
with a sneaky grin on his face
CASSIDY
Fuckin deadly
INT GAS STATION - NIGHT 4

Tulip has piled a first aid kit and several bottles of water
in front of the bored looking clerk

TULIP
And these too please

41

The clerk grunts Tulip looks round curious as an engine
starts Out the window we see her pick-up start to move
away

TULIP
Fuck

She races out of the office and sprints after the truck as it
heads for the road fumbling in her purse

INT TULIPS PICK-UP - NIGHT 42

Cassidy is driving whistling happily to himself Just as he
pulls out onto the road Tulip leaps onto the truck grabbing
the driver side door and hauling herself up With her free
hands she sticks the gun we saw earlier in Cassidys face
furious Hes startled

TULIP
Pull over

Cassidy stares at her in amazement keeps going

TULIP
I said pull over asshole What the

CASSIDY
(laughing in disbelief)
What the fuck does it look like Im

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 43
The truck picks up speed racing past us with Tulip hanging

off the side Up ahead theres a rise in the road with some
low hills beyond

INT TULIPS PICK-UP - NIGHT 44

Cassidy cant believe this finds it hilarious This makes
Tulip even angrier

TULIP

CASSIDY

TULIP

In the back of the truck Jesse is being bounced around all
over the place He wakes slowly still woozy

JESSE
Huh
Cassidy is actually looking a bit concerned now but not for
himself Tulip is ready to shoot
CASSIDY

TULIP
What Im gonna do is blow your head

seconds time Three Two

Cassidy faces front freaks

CASSIDY
Jesus fuckin Christ

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 45

As the truck comes over the rise in the road it screeches to

a halt in a huge broadside skid Twenty yards ahead is Hugo
Roots roadblock Two cruisers have been parked in the road
with just enough space for a car to slip between them and
then only by turning sharply Powerful lights flood the pick-
up Eight DEPUTIES man the roadblock reacting immediately

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 47

No sooner has the truck stopped moving than a sheriffs dept
helicopter roars up over the hill from behind the roadblock

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT 48

Behind the pilot a MARKSMAN takes aim with a mean looking
scope rifle at the pick-up truck below He wears a radio
headset over which we hear the crackle of static

MARKSMAN
Sheriff Root I have ‘em locked
Repeat I got a lock on them Sir

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 49

The deputies take cover behind the cars taking aim with a
variety of handguns pump shotguns and Ml6és Standing in the
middle revolver in one hand bullhorn in the other is Hugo

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT 51

The marksman opens fire even as Hugo speaks three quick
shots

HUGO (over radio)

INT TULIPS PICK-UP - NIGHT 52

Cassidy and Tulip recoil in shock as the bullets punch
through the hood barely a foot in front of them

CASSIDY
Fuckin Jesus

They exit the truck fast

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 53

Cassidy and Tulip get out of the truck hands high As the
helicopter passes overhead Jesse can be seen in the back of
the truck still holding his head

MARKSMAN 0S)

(over radio)
You got a third subject in the back

Hugo shouts again His deputies are squinting down their
gunsights taking no chances

HUGO
(over bullhorn)
You in the back we aint gonna warn

Jesse sits up rubbing his head He notices Tulip then
Cassidy both standing with their hands raised He frowns
Cassidy’s bewildered at his sudden appearance Tulip is at a
loss

CASSIDY

HUGO
(over bullhorn)

Hugo puts the bullhorn down relaxes a bit Kenny doesnt
seem so confident A couple of deputies move forward the
rest Stay put

HUGO
(spitting)

The helicopter makes a low pass on our heroes now leaning
against the truck as per Hugos instructions Jesse rubs his
head grimacing angrily

CASSIDY

He turns towards the roadblock grim as hell lowering his
arms Tulip gasps

TULIP

Hugo snarls again Lots of clicks as his men cock their
guns

HUGO
(over bullhorn)
Hold it right there Mister You put

Jesse raises his head glares at us He looks like he really
means business When he speaks everything else goes utterly
silent Theres a weird deep echo to his voice This is
the WORD OF GOD the power hes gotten from Genesis

JESSE
word of God
Drop the guns All of you And let
us go

The deputies freeze So does Hugo Their faces go blank A
moment passes Then they start dropping their guns on the
ground A loud clatter as the various firearms hit the deck

INT HELICOPTER NIGHT 54

The marksman equally blank-faced drops his rifle out the
side of the ‘copter The sound of the rotors can be heard
beating faintly as if far away

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 55

The marksmans rifle lands on deputy Fosters head dropping
him instantly Hugo is right beside him but can only blink
confused Jesse turns to the astonished Tulip and Cassidy
quietly determined

JESSE
I think we oughta be leavin’

They stare at him for a second then snap out’ of it

CASSIDY
Im with you mate

TULIP
Just a fucking second This guy was
gonna steal my truck

Jesses eyes narrow as he turns to Cassidy who grins
disarmingly

CASSIDY
Aye but I can explain that Just
give us a lift down the road will
you Id really appreciate it

TULIP
Like hell

55 55

Jesse studies Cassidy carefully Cassidy meets his gaze
without being hostile Theyre sizing each other up

JESSE
(nodding slightly)
Get in the truck

CASSIDY
Aw nice one
TULIP
Have you gone out of your fucking

mind

Jesse looks ready to speak then freezes His eyes narrow in
intense bewildered concentration We close up on his face

56 INT JESSES VISION 56

A three-second flash of images - blazing flames - an angelic
face screaming a demonic face roaring

57 EXT DESERT ROAD NIGHT 57

Jesses face twists in confusion Then he snaps out of it
looks at Tulip

JESSE
I aint about to leave anyone to get
fucked up by these assholes We can
talk about it later Okay

Tulip glances at the cops fumes wrenches open the door
Jesse gets in she follows Cassidys already gotten in the
passenger side

58 EXT DESERT NIGHT 58

We look past someones leg and flapping duster coat at the
distant lights of the roadblock The Saint has arrived

59 EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 59
Tulip starts the engine moves off Hugo and his deputies

snap out of it as the truck speeds through their roadblock
narrowly missing a couple of the cruisers Theyre amazed

( )

59 59

Pick up your fuckin’ guns you
assholes

They do but by then the truck has raced away General
confusion Deputy Foster gets shakily to his feet poking at
his bleeding scalp Hugo having retrieved his pistol is
furious

HUGO
You bunch of goddamned by-the-Jesus
stupid cocksuckin faggots - you
stood there an let those bastards
drive away -

KENNY
(amazed)
So did you

One of the deputies on the edge of the group turns towards
us eyes narrowing

DEPUTY
Sheriff Root
r Hugo yanks open the door of the nearest cruiser
HUGO

Well come on for Jesus sake Get
after them You there you get that
chopper on the horn -

DEPUTY
(shouting)
Sheriff Root

Everyone turns Hugo included The Deputy rather shaken
points out into the desert About thirty yards from the
roadblock stands the Saint of Killers Not too much detail
visible on him yet The deputies watch not sure of what to
make of him Kennys eyes narrow cautious Hes standing
slightly in front of Hugo Hugo slams the door shut glares
at us

HUGO
Well well well

The Saint is unmoved coat flapping a little in the breeze
head lowered slightly so the brim of his hat hides most of

his face Hugo puts a hand to his holstered pistol His
i deputies bring up their weapons not taking their eyes off
the Saint

( ) 59

HUGO
Who the fuck have we got here

No answer comes Hugo looks annoyed

HUGO
You look to me like you might be
trouble Mister

The Saint doesnt move His voice isnt much more than a
slow whisper but it sounds terribly grim full of restrained
threat

SAINT
Yeah

The Saint raises his head slow and deliberate His eyes are
cold and hard promising nothing but death Utterly
riveting terrifying His lip curls slightly He speaks
through his teeth unimpressed by what he sees a hint of
disdain in his voice To him this is just an inconvenience -
not worth getting angry or peeved over He does everything
slowly gradually He has no need to rush

SAINT
An you dont look to me like the man
wholl stop it

The deputies are suddenly unaccountably scared looking
warily at one another Hugo grimaces annoyed

HUGO
Is that a fact

KENNY
Sheriff Root -

HUGO
Who the fuck does this asshole think
he is You boys get ready now
The Saint pushes his coat back to reveal his holstered
pistols He doesnt pose with his hands over them or any
Hollyweod gunfighter bullshit He acts like he has all the
time in the world

KENNY
(scared)
Sheriff Root for Gods sake Look
at him

( 59

HUGO
(snarling)
Fuck you Kenny The minute he goes
for them pistols you open f-

The Saints hands blur to his holsters and come up with two
black iron Walker Colt revolvers Two massive roaring blasts
fill the air flame shoots from the muzzles smoke belches
back

Deputy Fosters large gut explodes in a weiter of gore
Renny barely registers this as his shoulder erupts in a spray
of blood and his entire arm is blown off

The arm cartwheels past Hugo in slow motion still holding
Kennys pistol blood jetting everywhere

Hugo gasps as blood from the arm sprays into his face

The Saint steps towards the terrified deputies cocks his
pistols fires again He aims casually as he moves forward
at a stroll

The others bring up their guns and open fire Multiple
shots automatic and shotgun fire Two of them are flung
backwards by the Saints bullets torn bloodily open

DEPUTY
Son of a bitch -

DEPUTY 2
Drop him

Bullets and slugs smash into the Saint staggering him
slightly One smashes into his face turning his head

He turns back grimacing clearly not pleased Theres a
hole in his face and several more in his chest but no blood
comes out Its like dead meat underneath The deputies
gape in amazement

DEPUTY
Aw no

The Saint cocks his pistols as he advances now barely yards
from the parked cruisers One guy breaks and runs Another
sinks behind the car cowering in terror The other two
resume firing 59

The Saint takes more hits but isnt worried He walks
towards Kenny who lies on the ground in deep shock ruined
shoulder pumping blood into a widening pool on the road

The shooting continues as the Saints shadow falls across
Kenny who opens his eyes He dies a rather pissed-off man

KENNY
(whispers)
Fuck you Sheriff Root

The Saint doesnt bother to aim just pulls the trigger as he
walks past Kenny Another blast He brings up the second
pistol as more bullets smash into him fires

A deputy’s head is blown completely apart

The one cowering behind the cruiser is blubbering
pathetically back jammed against the side of the car The
last guy still shooting yells desperately at the cowardly
guy -

SCARED DEPUTY
Oh Jesus Christ please save me now I
fuckin beg you Dont let me die
here Dont let me die

DEPUTY
For Christs sake shoot back at him
you stupid son of a bitch

The Saint takes careful aim fires once

The bullet punches through the side panel of the cruiser
just over the front wheel with a metallic clang

On the other side the scared deputy gapes in amazement as
the bullet tears out of his chest in a shower of blood and
meat

The deputy beside him ceases fire turning to stare Beyond
him about fifty yards down the road we see the deputy who
broke and ran earlier

Another roaring gunshot and the nearer deputy loses the front
of his head Beyond him about a second later the running
deputy throws up his arms and falls

INT TULIP’S PICK-UP - NIGHT 60

Jesse turns to stare out the back window bewildered The
lights of the firefight and the roadblock can be seen
reflected in the glass

JESSE
Tulip will you pull over for a
second

TULIP

Will I what

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 61

Hugo Root kneels at the end of the carnage furious trying
to wipe the blood out of his eyes

HUGO
What the fuck is goin on Fuck
Sons of fuckin whores -

He clears his eyes looks up blinking realizes the Saints
legs are about three feet away

The Saint watches calmly pistols held at his sides Hes
been shot about a dozen times but the wounds seem like
nothing more than cuts or bad bruises Hes not so angry
now back to the slow-burning disdain

Hugo stands up slow holding his hands up open and empty
Hes not so much scared as very very cautious His pistol
is gone from its holster

HUGO
Nowyou Can see I aint armed

The Saint raises one of the pistols points it right at us
The muzzle is a yawning black chasm

SAINT
Reckon you can see I am

Hugo closes his eyes sweating buckets Weary disgusted
fear shows at last on his face

Then multiple gunshots and the Saint is rocked by the

impact of several bullets The sound of the helicopter
rotors come back

61

The helicopter roars back into place over the shattered
roadblock

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT 62

The marksman has an automatic pistol dead-aimed with both
hands yelling into his radio headset

MARKSMAN
(over loudspeaker)
Sheriff Root run Get the fuck

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 63

The Saint turns to look up at the ‘copter not too impressed
Behind him Hugo snaps out of it and runs like hell

The ‘copter hovers barely twenty yards over the cars and
seattered bodies the Saint turning towards it The marksman
can clearly be seen locked on target

MARKSMAN
(over loudspeaker)
You Drop them guns an’ raise your

Cassidy and Jesse have exited the truck and are peering back
along the road Tulip watches from the truck wary

TULIP
Well

JESSE
Its hard to see -

A sudden flash of light illuminates them as they stagger
back shielding their eyes

EXT DESERT ROAD NIGHT 65
Massive flaring explosion with a rumbling echoing blast

right on top of the two cruisers with the ‘copters tail
sticking out of the inferno Pieces of blazing car and

‘copter fly into the air

seven operations to fix him up the

He comes up with an 8x10 photo which we never see He looks
at it frowning thoughtfully

he never sounds anything other than completely cheerful Try

furnished and not very clean wWorn-out furniture old TV
set Hugo dumps his hat on the coffee table sits down

(Still no letter from Mom but I bet

pissed off at his wretched lot in life Then he closes his
eyes puts his head in his hands and breaks down completely

EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT 76

The bar is a wide one-storey building out in the desert
with several cars and pick-ups - including Tulips - in the
parking lot Across the road from it is a small all night
supermarketmini-mall with more cars parked outside Seems
to be closing The bar however is very much open a large
neon sign over it reads THE RATTLER People come and go
Music drifts out into the night

INT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT 77

Inside the Rattler is a fairly dead kind of place Same mix
of smoke neon and gloom that weve seen before Plenty of
people in but everyone seems to stay in little groups or
couples - no dancing no boisterous groups around the bar A

good place to go to drink yourself into a wretched mess and
cry into your whiskey

Couple of WAITRESSES at work not exactly rushed off their
feet One is young and pretty

Cassidy and Tulip sit at a table near the back Tulip trying
to be inconspicuous Cassidy glances around naturally
curious He smokes and drinks beer she has some kind of
stupid cocktail with an umbrella in it A glass of Bourbon
and ice sits in front of an empty chair

CASSIDY
Happenin’ fuckin place isnt it

TULIP
Keep it down will you Were meant
to be blending in

CASSIDY
(amused)
Blend in Sure you just went on a
shopping spree across the road there

mile walking around covered in burnt
rags isnt he And by the way

Oh look theres your boyfriend now

Jesse enters the bar dressed in his new clothes the white
collar setting off the black outfit Hes cleaned himself up
a bit too and cuts quite a dashing figure as he strides
across the bar towards the rear table He seems to radiate
supreme self-confidence lighting up a Marlboro as he goes
hardly aware of anyone else

Several folks notice him including the pretty young
waitress who likes what she sees and discreetly sets off
after him

A bunch of REDNECKS notice her noticing him instantly
disapproving These guys are all young bucks on their fifth
or sixth beer just about ready to go looking for trouble

Jesse notices none of this He moseys over to the table

watched by Tulip who cant help but smile A hint of
nostalgia here for her

Dont mention it Well its pretty
bleedin obvious to me that all this
stuffs linked up I mean from what
you were sayin earlier you get hit
by thiswhatever it is you
incinerate your congregation-

JESSE

Not by choice Well probably not

CASSIDY
You develop this word of God an all
of a sudden youve got the gunfighter
after you

JESSE
‘Cause he doesn’t want me doin’ this
shit or somethin’ Yeah that
figures

CASSIDY
Ill tell you one thing about him he
looks like a good man to avoid like
the fucking plague

JESSE
Maybe so
TULIP
Maybe so
JESSE
© Like I say I want some answers If
it turns out I gotta go to him to get

‘emthere it is

CASSIDY
Did you see what he did out there
tonight The bastard can shoot down
helicopters Bullets bounce off him
He can walk through a fuckin
firestorm for Jesus’ sake

JESSE
(leaning in annoyed)

I dont care if he can shoot cruise
missiles from his pecker Nobody - I
mean nobody - fucks with me like I
been fucked with today an’ walks away
with their teeth still intact An
if that motherfucker wants to get in
my way hes gonna be wearin’ his six-
guns up his ass

A pause Cassidy seems rather fazed not sure what to think

Jesse just drinks his bourbon

CASSIDY
Youre not much of a one for backin
down in the face of adversity are
you Jesse

Tulip looks at Cassidy

wearily shaking her head No he isnt Nor was he ever

EXT TRUCKSTOP BAR - NIGHT

A very different sort of bar the TEN-TEN
eighteen-wheelers parked outside
from within along with raised voices shouts

and lively

A truck roars past in the background

INT TRUCKSTOP BAR - NIGHT

A number of
Loud country music blares
Sounds good

This is indeed a much livelier place than the Rattler The
clientele is generally older - truckers in their 30s and 40s
cutting loose a jukebox pumping out CandW at full volume

waitresses getting friendly with the boys

A number of

locals about too a few couples about - basically lots of
friends meeting up enjoying their all too rare times

together as they pass through

Several folks dancing

Up at the bar a slightly toasted trucker slaps his pals on
the back kisses the barmaid goodbye and weaves for the

door

81

TRUCKER
---I gotta go boys I need to sleep
this off an be halfway to Memphis by
tomorrow night Ill see you

BARMAID
You say hi to your wife for me
Frank

TRUCKER
(laughing)
Thatll be the day

Out he goes The others go back to their conversation A
moment passes

Then theres the most God-almighty bang and the trucker is
flung back into the bar with half his chest blown away
frantically trying to stay on his feet He falls backwards
smashes into the jukebox - the music stops Then he falls on
the floor and dies in a bloody heap Everyone gapes

A confused buzz of fear and confusion fills the air People
move to the fallen trucker Then one guy turns towards the
door freezes

GUY
Oh Jesus

Its the Saint framed in the doorway blue smoke curling up
from his pistol

Everyone turns to stare riveted

He strides up to the bar oblivious to their stares
Theres a loud clunk as he sets the revolver on the bar
He fixes the petrified barmaid with his steely glare

SAINT
Whiskey

Mouth clamped shut for fear shell scream the barmaid sets
down a glass and pours him a shot The noise of the flowing
whiskey is the only thing audible

The Saint knocks it back sets down the glass For just a
moment he seems thoughtful

SAINT

First drink Ive hadsince Wounded
Knee

(

49 al

The moment passes the icy cold returns to his eyes and he
reaches for the pistol Sudden panic shows on the faces of
the people around him A sense of something terrible about
to happen

EXT ROADHOUSE BAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT B2

Jesse Tulip and Cassidy have left the Rattler Tulip isnt
too happy Jesse grimaces a little Cassidy follows
enjoying their argument

TULIP
You got a nice little ass honey
You go ahead an keep Tulips last
five bucks”

JESSE
Aw now that wasnt it at all

REDNECK LEADER (0S)
You dont like it here drink some
other goddamned place

They turn Advancing slowly on them are the little band of
rednecks from the bar just drunk enough to want to get into
it The leader is a brawny thug in a baseball cap Six of
them in total

Cassidy steps in front of Tulip so hes just behind and to
the side of Jesse Jesse remains cool even polite

JESSE
I like it fine

The leader stops about a yard from Jesse

REDNECK LEADER
That aint what you said to Mona
Called it a den of sin or some shit
I heard you

JESSE
(weary)
Oh Jesuslook if shes your girl
relax okay I aint interested
You got me all wrong

REDNECK LEADER
(turning cap back to front)
I reckon I got you just right
motherfucker

82

Jesse changes in an instant His eyes narrow He goes icy
cold

Cassidy steps up behind him grins

CASSIDY
You know I think the problem is that
she isnt his girl

REDNECK LEADER
You sayin Im some kinda homo

Jesse is icy cold Behind him Cassidys grin becomes
positively predatory

JESSE
Im sayin’ youd crawl over fifty
good pussies to get to a fat boys
ass

The leader moves - too slow Jesse slams two fingers up his
nostrils twists and rips upwards A terrible ripping anda
gout of blood The guy howls and falls The others are so
surprised Jesse has time to step in and hook a right left
and another right into the second guy’s face He drops like
a ton of shit

A third guy reaches for Jesse but Cassidy grabs his
shoulder smiles nastily and headbutts him in the face A
massive almost hollow-sounding impact The guys eyes bulge
and he falls nose spread all over his face like a burst
tomato

Jesse ducks a swing from number four sinks a low one into
the guys stomach The guy folds up around it gasping

Number five jumps on Cassidys back The sixth guy dances
back out of trouble

The sixth guy sneakily snaps open a switchblade waits for
his chance

Jesse holds number four against a car and punches the shit
out of him

Cassidy flips the fifth one over his shoulder
The guy flies at least ten yards through the air
Tulips eyes widen as she follows the arc of his descent

TULIP
Jesus Christ 82

Big crash as the guy smashes into the side of a pick-up truck
like a broken rag doll upside down

Tulip turns back to the fight freaks

TULIP
Cassidy

CASSIDY
Yeah

Cassidy turns - right into the sixth guys attack He slams
the switchblade clean through the plastic lens of Cassidys
shades on into the eye beyond

Cassidy steps back hand going to his eye then coming away
again

Tulip stares

Cassidy and the guy look at each other Cassidy is calm
The handle of the blade juts from his shades lens blade all
the way in The guy is frozen Beyond them we get a
glimpse of Jesse still demolishing his own victim

Cassidy reaches up holds the shades with one hand tugs the
blade out of his eye with no discernible pain whatsoever
Blood and jelly slide from the blade leaking down from
behind his shades as well

CASSIDY
Hang on a second there mate Til
be right with you
Pop Out comes the blade slathered in gore
Tulip’s eyes widen further

CASSIDY Right Cmere

We hear the guy scream in terror - a scream which is just as
suddenly cut off

TULIP
JJJesse

Jesse quits beating on the redneck whose face is now pulp
Jesse holds him up with one hand and turns then drops him
Jesses jaw drops open in amazement as he stares

JESSE
Jesus Fuckin Christ

82 82

Cassidy holds his would-be assailants lifeless body up by
the hair spits out a lump of bloody meat lets the blood
pour down his chin The meat is from the guys neck which
Cassidy has just bitten a hole in Blood spurts out in long
jets pumping into the dirt

CASSIDY
What

He hauls the corpse up sinks his mouth into the wound and
starts drinking the blood as it pours out Loud gulping
noises can be heard

Tulip still freaked turns slowly to the riveted Jesse

TULIP
Say something

Cassidy quits drinking for a second gasps with delight

JESSE
What the fuck you do that for
CASSIDY
© I was hungry
JESSE

So you figured youd snack on this
fellas neck What are you some
kinda fuckin’ vampire

CASSIDY
Well I just flung a fella twenty
feet through the air I took a
switchblade straight in the brain
without blinkin an I tore a
fellas throat open so I could drink
his blood Id say I was pretty
obviously some kind of fuckin
vampire wouldnt you

JESSE
Itcant be

CASSIDY
(laughing in disbelief)
Oh aye listen to Mister Normal

Utterly thrown Jesse stares at Tulip trying to fit this
thing into his head 82
TULIP
For Christs sake hes doing it
again

He is indeed gulping away at the guys neck

JESSE

(angry)
Goddamnit Cassidy Knock it off

But Cassidy clearly likes it too much gulping merrily away
Blood dribbles everywhere

CASSIDY
(between gulps)
Just a minute -

Jesse snarls and once again his voice echoes with his new-
found power

JESSE
(word of God
Knock it off

Cassidy is amazed He flings the corpse to the ground
furious

CASSIDY
For fucks sake

Jesse and Cassidy yell at each other both furious right in
each others faces

CASSIDY
Dont you fuckin’ dare do that shit
to me Nobody tells me what to do
An I dont know if you noticed but
that wee shite stuck a knife in my
eye

JESSE
That dont make him a two-dollar
Slurpee An Idve told you to fuck
yourself the minute I laid eyes on
you if I’d known you were some kinda
fuckin’ abomination

Cassidy freezes stunned For just a second he looks hurt -
then his face sets in a pissed-off grimace Jesse faces him
with narrowed eyes Neither man will give ground

Then Cassidy turns on his heel and stomps away

34 82

Tulip watches him go then turns to Jesse who has turned
away and is angrily lighting a Marlboro

An engine starts Tulip turns in that direction eyes
narrowing

TULIP
Jesse

JESSE
Forget it Tulip I dont wanna talk
about it

TULIP
But Jesse-

JESSE
I said I dont wanna-

TULIP
Jesse hes stealing my truck
Again

So he is The truck pulls out of the parking lot

JESSE
Shit

He charges after the truck but it’s already racing off down
the road

JESSE
Come back here you unbelievable
motherfucker Ill kick your fucking
ass to death Fuck

He gives up roaring hatefully

JESSE
You worthless son of a bitch

Tulip’s hand comes into shot between us and Jesse firing her
gun Jesse gapes

Tulip snarls with hatred blasting away until the pistol
locks dry

Jesse stares

TULIP
Bastard

The engine noise disappears into the night along with the
echo of the gunshots

JESSE
(grabbing the gun)
What the fuck is this

TULIP
(grabbing it back)
Its mine is what it is

JESSE
Tulip what are you doing with this
fucking thing

TULIP
Im defending myself

Behind them several people are exiting the bar drawn by the
noise

Jesse and Tulip notice them

TULIP

they get a look at your little
massacre theyre gonna have the cops

JESSE
(reluctant)
I dunno Im gettin’ sick of runnin’

TULIP

people to beat up later Come on
for Christs sake

They melt into the night

EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT 83

light of the cruisers and ambulances as they pull away from
the distant Rattler and disappear into the night

Jesse turns notices Tulip is shivering a bit hugging
herself Shes not exactly dressed for the cool desert
night Jesse takes his coat off wraps it round her Shes
a little startled looks up at him They find themselves
very close for a moment

Then they move apart both rather awkward

The truck stops at the side of the road Cassidy cuts the
engine and sticks his head out the window He takes a long
deep breath - and freezes amazed

CASSIDY
Jesus

off down the road

Way way out in the distance far from the speeding truck a
curious blood-red glow lines the horizon Its much too red
to be dawn almost like a line of lava spilling from a fault

TULIP
Okay How about we both ‘fess up

Jesse is caught off guard He watches her curious She
just smiles back interested challenging him Then he
lowers his gaze resigned

JESSE
Hell why not With all this other
shit down on our heads guess it

difference anyway

Tulip smiles pleased Then Jesse looks up

JESSE
But you go first

That catches her for a moment She hesitates then takes a
deep breath

TULIP
I ought to say right up front that

(calmer)
So what with the drinking and then
looking for you in the occasional
moments of sobriety I let the whole
thing get out of control and Macavoy
called a halt to the proceedings
Wanted his money back I couldnt
pay So he said I had to do
something for him in exchange

Jesse is watching her very carefully now

TULIP
Christ I dont know I didn’t ‘have
any choice You swear theres things
you would never do you could never
do - and all of a sudden
circumstances change and you find
yourself doing stuff no matter how
awful it is

ago In Houston

EXT HOUSTON STREET - NIGHT
Flashback to Tulip standing on a street corner in a shitty
part of town purse over her shoulder nervous She just
cant relax She turms towards us notices something that
sets her even more on edge
A black Mercedes is parked just outside a bar which seems to
have just closed Two scruffily-suited THUGS wait at the car
while a THIRD locks the door of the bar pulls down the
shutters Also at the bar is a FAT GUY in a slightly better
suit clearly their boss
Tulip watches now downright scared
TULIP

Oh my God I can’t believe Im gonna

do this
She glances down at her purse
The third guy finishes locking up and gets in the back of the
car with the fat guy between him and another thug The last
one gets in front to drive
Tulip staring terrified takes a step forward Then
another And another

The thug in the rear seat - on the side facing Tulip - leans
out the window and grins at her We can just see the thug on
the other side of the fat guy leaning round to watch

THUG
Pardon me Maam

Tulip jumps startled out of her daze

TULIP
Wahh

The thug makes a two-inch diameter circle with his thumb and
forefinger smiles innocently

THUG
You reckon you could get your mouth
around something this wide ‘Cause
if you could Id like to marry you

Tulip freezes stunned We hear the carload of jerks crack
up laughing Then Tulip’s face changes to a look of total
fury and she pulls the Desert Eagle from her ‘purse

THUG (08
Holy shittt

And we freeze frame right there

INT MOTEL ROOM NIGHT 95

Jesse is staring wideeyed at Tulip mouth shut but she
doesnt notice She seems really irritated

TULIP
See what had me so terrified was the
thought of using a gun on someone I

all about guns and defending myself
and everything and now here was this
guy this rival of Macavoys I was
supposed to blow awayI mean just

completes the draw and fires

lower jaw stares at it Its a ghastly mess of bone meat
and teeth

His pals stare at him He stares at them

Tulip looks up anxious to change the subject

TULIP
So anyway your turn

JESSE
(fazed)
I dont think so

TULIP
Okay okay I know It was a
horrible thing to do I know that
But just for that instant after
being so terrified I was sure I
could really do it I think thats
what scares me the most

JESSE
Im glad to hear that

Tulip looks up curious

JESSE
‘Cause the Tulip I remember the
thought of takin someones life -
even an assholes life - woulda
scared the livin’ hell outta her

She smiles a little So does he A warm moment between
them Tulip even laughs a little then more

TULIP
Yours is gonna have to be a pretty
wild fucking story to beat that

Jesse smiles sadly

JESSE

a difficult for him

muscles gone from his arms so thin
this little bitty nurse could pick

man had been cut down to nothin I
sat down at his bedside an took his
hand an’ he looked at mean all

was still right there

He raises his head now fiercely proud for just that moment

JESSE
Still right there in my Daddys eyes

Tulip is genuinely affected by this sorry for him His
voice softens again

JESSE
It was him Tulip He got me to
become a minister Just like hed

I looked in those eyes of his an I
knew I had no choice but to do just
like he wanted

TULIP
Couldnt you have told me

JESSE
Oh I thought about it I was gonna

wanted you to go on hating me To
leave me outta your life an’ go away
an’ have a chance of being happy
An then I dunno Id be able to
carry on doin what I had to do no

(pause)
See I knew I caused my Daddy pain
with the life I was leadin He told
me he said “If you make one promise
in your life that means anything son
- please let it be this one“ He
brought me into this world He fed
an clothed me an raised me the way
he thought was just an’ proper An
seein’ him in that bed I knew I had
one final chance to do right by him

goddamned thing to do

r He looks at her smiles sadly

JESSE
An’ now look I did the right thing
I fucked up my life an’ I fucked up
yours even worse an’ what I achieved
by 1t don’t amount to a bucket of
horseshit

He slumps a bit Tulip looks up struck by a thought

TULIP
Jesse why dont we just get the hell
out of this madness right now Just
run for it - you use that power
youve got to order anyone who messes
with us out of our way and we keep
going and dont stop ‘til were far

towards his car

INT HUGOS CAR - NIGHT 104
Hugo gets in

HUGO

He starts her up

HUGO

EXT HUGOS HOUSE - NIGHT 105
The car speeds away The rear lights fade into the night

Then from the gloom at the side of the house Arseface
pedals out on a BMX bicycle thats really far too small for
him Legs pumping furiously he races off after Hugo as fast
as ne can

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 106

Jesse and Tulip lie in bed both apparently asleep Their
clothes lie all over the place Just a sheet over them

Jesse opens his eyes dozy for a second Then he turns to
Tulip studies her for a long moment He gets out of bed and
creeps to the bathroom

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 107

A small cramped room with a dim light Letting the sink
fill with water Jesse dozily watches himself in the little
mirror above the sink

JESSE
Nice goin Custer You think of
anything else you can do to
complicate things even more you be
sure an let me know

He leans down splashes water on his face

He stands straight again freezes The image in the mirror
is now one of roaring blazing flames Weird thing is the
light from them is trapped within the mirror doesnt
illuminate the bathroom at all

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 108

Tulip wakes up dozy then registers Jesses not beside her
She sits up wary

1608

TULIP
Jesse

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 109

Jesse stares face twisted completely bewildered

INT MIRRORVISION 110

The flames blaze away They seem to go on forever Nothing
else is visible

Then centred in shot we see a small black object
silhouetted against the fire

Moving closer we realize that it’s two figures locked
together having very violent sex One is an ANGELIC MALE
just like the one whose face we glimpsed when Jesse was
possessed by Genesis He has vast white wings golden hair
big muscles and no clothes He holds his partner by the
throat roaring in agony and anger The other is the same
DEMON FEMALE we saw during Jesses possession huge curved
horns cloven hooves shiny jet-black body clawed hands and
big fangs She has her legs wrapped around the Angels waist
as they hump away like crazy She tears her claws down his
back spraying blood across his wings and bites chunks of
flesh from his chest

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT lll

Jesse continues to stare jaw suddenly dropping at what he
sees

INT MIRRORVISION 112

The two figures still locked together soar upwards until
theyre high over the flames both screaming in ecstasy now

The fires are far below them and then disappear from view as

they emerge into a beautiful skyscape of rolling white and
silver clouds and sparkling sunlight

The Angel and Demon become more gentle holding each other
looking into each others eyes

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 113

The door opens and Tulip comes in puzzled holding a sheet
around her Jesse continues to stare into the mirror
riveted

TULIP
Jesse

She moves beside him looks past him
All she sees are their reflections

She looks curiously at Jesse whos still gaping into the
mirror in disbelief face twisted

TULIP
Yeahwellyou certainly are
hideous Im surprised your Mom
didnt sell you to the circus Jesse

JESSE
(snapping out of it)
Huh
TULIP

Are you okay What the hell are you
staring in the mirror for

JESSE
(after a long pause)
Looked to me kinda like an angel of
the Lord an’ a demon from Hell
Fucking

Theres an even longer pause while Tulip takes a hard look in
the mirror

TULIP
(doubtful)
I see
JESSE

No wait a minute goddamnit I saw
them already tonight Both of ‘em
An’ I saw ‘em when that fuckin’ thing
hit me in the church just before
everybody got fried Im tellin

113

TULIP
But what does that have to do with
angels and demons

JESSE
I dunno but its showin them to me
It wants me to know what they did
It gave me this power the
gunfighters after me because of it

TULIP
And they were reallydoing it
JESSE
They were fuckin’ each others brains

TULIP

Well lookthis thing that I

better word - if its showing you

JESSE
(incredulous)
Their child

They stare at each other for a moment amazed Then Jesse
turns away wary thinking hard

EXT TRUCKSTOP BAR - NIGHT 114

Cassidy exits Tulips truck and walks quickly towards the
door of the Ten-Ten He sniffs the air again His face
lights up and he heads on in Dim light from within but no
noise or sign of movement

INT TRUCKSTOP BAR - NIGHT 115

Cassidy freezes as he enters face suddenly twisting in
disbelief

The scene that greets him in the low light of the bar is a
nightmare Two dozen bodies lie on the floor of the bar in a
vast lake of dark red blood All bear the massive gaping
wounds that the Saints guns deliver Severed arms lie here
and there A couple of bodies are actually headless Gore
is splattered across the walls Tables have been knocked

115 115

over a sense of panicked rush towards the rear of the room
which no-one quite managed to reach

SAINT (0S)
I knew what you were the first time I
laid eyes on you boy

Cassidy turns sees the Saint standing in the gloom by the
bar looking grimly back at him Cassidy is instantly
scared cant help but show it

SAINT

An’ I knew a bloodsucker like you
would come runnin if I was to set
the table for you

(pause)
That thing inside the Preacher -
thatll draw scum like you from miles
around That urge you got to take a
look at Texas werent you wonderin
where that came from

Cassidy is startled realizing the Saint is right

SAINT
r Now I reckon we can make it work the
other way around I reckon you can

give that Preacher a call an hell
come runnin’

Cassidys eyes narrow slowly He gets angry He points
slowly to the carnage on the floor further back

CASSIDY
You killed them to get me here

The Saint just looks back at him

CASSIDY

You fuckin’ dirty bastard Dyou
think I want any part of this D’you
think Id sell out Jesse Custer to a
piece of shite like you

(angrier)
Do you think Im some kind of
worthless fuckin animal or
somethin’

SAINT
Thats exactly what I think

- Cassidy loses it strides towards the Saint drawing a fist
back to strike - but the Saint pulls his pistol fast as

(2

lightning and shoves it in Cassidys face

gritting his teeth

Cassidy is sweating now really scared

the name

CASSIDY
Isthat supposed to scare me or
somethin ‘Cause believe me it
wouldnt be the first time I got shot
through the head

SAINT
Itd be the first time you didn’t get
up again
(pause)
Saint of Killers is what they call

SAINT
I thought it might Fella dont get
as old as you have without hearin’ my
name whispered I left this world in
eighteen eighty-six an’ went to Hell
for all the lives Id taken an when
I got there I just went right on
killin Hells supposed to knock
the hate from a sinners soul but
all it did for mine was burn it
blacker I butchered my way across
Perdition an damn near emptied it of
souls except the Lord Himself came
down an begged for me to stop Even
offered me a job Wanted me to take
over from the goddamned Angel of
Death who it turned out had no
stomach for an eternity of killin’

Cassidy freezes

Clearly hes heard

He presses the gun into Cassidys chin tilts his head back
Cassidy is shitting himself too terrified to move

SAINT
But I did So the Angel of Death
gave up his sword an’ forged me this
pair of Colt revolvers from the
steel You know who I am boy You
want to take the risk this gun wont
work on you

He cocks the pistol Cassidy freezes A long moment passes

Then Cassidy crumples breaking down 115

CASSIDY
No

The Saint keeps the pistol on him nods at a phone on the
bar Cassidy shakily backs towards it never taking his eyes
off the pistol He picks it up sweats

CASSIDY
There was a motel just down the road
from where I left him He didnt
have any transport okay So if I
can get the number for the motel

Another shove from the Saint pistol to the nose

Cassidy is utterly miserable wretched

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 116

phone rings They look at it then at each other
nonplussed

The Saint relaxes takes his gun off Cassidy - who freaks a
little and seizes his chance

CASSIDY

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 120

Jesse grimaces as a massive bang sounds on the line He
turns to look at Tulip both of them pretty freaked out

INT TRUCKSTOP BAR - NIGHT 121

Cassidy lies on the floor staring up at the ceiling amazed
Slowly he raises his head looks down at his body

A massive hole has been blasted in his gut blood pouring
from it to pool around him

A shadow falls over him
Its the Saint of course holding his smoking pistol

CASSIDY

(weak)
He wont come now you bastard

anticipating his chance to wreak cruel violent revenge on

strides out of it cold as ice He passes us without a

glance and were left with nothing but night again

EXT TRUCKSTOP BAR - NIGHT 131

Silence The TEN-TEN sign flickers then goes out

INT TRUCKSTOP BAR - NIGHT 132

Cassidy lies on the floor shattered apparently dead The
hole in his guts has been matched by another in his chest - a
meaty crater with blood gore and bits of rib hanging out
right where his heart used to be Mouth wide open

We move closer until his face fills the shot No movement
Then very slowly his jaw shifts a little

CASSIDY
Uh

He grits his teeth as he realizes whats up

CASSIDY
(weak)
Aw no
(pause)
Im sorry Jesse I just didnt have
the balls An’ theres nothing I can
do

His head slumps to the side beaten

132

We look at him past the edge of the vast lake of blood from
the Saints earlier victims Its gotten pretty dark and
gooey now

He notices it face slowly twisting as he thinks

CASSIDY
Oh fuck Oh fuckin’ Jesus

He stares at the ceiling again miserable a little revolted

CASSIDY
Why me

Steeling himself for the effort he grits his teeth and rolls
slowly over to his belly grabbing for purchase with a very
weak arm He yells in agony

Then gasping and sweating with the pain and exertion he
raises his head to look at the lake of gore and shattered
bodiesand we fade to black

We fade back in on a smear of ribs guts and blood on the
floor of the bar We move along it as it becomes a trail
ending in Cassidy - hes hauled himself along the floor and
is now lapping hungrily at the lake of blood on the floor
He raises his head dribbles gooey blood everywhere looks
weakly at the various bodies Hes gasping

CASSIDY
Sorry folks

Cassidy goes back to slurping up the blood panting as he
tries to breath and drink at the same time He gets more and
more frenzied guzzling the stuff faster and faster until he
throws his head back and gasps out a long sigh of
satisfaction Smeared with dark red blood hair matted with
it he looks like hell

He gets slowly to his feet staggers a bit catches himself
on the bar He wipes his mouth still out of breath

CASSIDY
Better’n fuckin’ spinach

Then he turns and staggers towards the door shaky nowhere
near at full strength

135 EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 135

Quieter now The lawmen have taken up positions behind their
cars in the storefronts along the tops of the building
Nearly fifty guys lots of firepower

The sheriff and three deputies still wait behind the car in
the middle of the street The sheriff has a pistol in one
hand the bullhorn in the other

SHERIFF
Nothin’ An’ still no sign of Hugo

Looking past them we can see right down the main street and
out into the desert night beyond Pretty quiet but very

tense

Shit Hand me out that goddamned

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 136

Sudden agitation among the cops as they cock their guns get
ready to open up All very tense

The sheriffs eyes narrow amazed

SHERIFF
Jesus Christ

The Saint enters town walking up the middle of the main
street He doesnt bother to even look at the cops

The sheriff snaps out of it grabs the bullhorm The deputy
beside him is shaky as hell

DEPUTY
Who the fuck is that

SHERIFF
Thats the son of a bitch off the
APB The fuckin cop killer
(over bullhorn)
You hold it right there you asshole
Were gonna give you one chance to
give yourself up-

The Saint draws and fires once fast as lightning still
moving coolly ahead No emotion

The bullet smashes into the side of the Sheriffs car
blowing a hole in the pan just above the gas ‘tank

SHERIFF
Fuck-

Barely an instant later the car explodes in a flaring blast
the bodywork separating and flying high into the air the

wheels shooting « out to the side The lawmen disappear in the
explosion

Then theres a dull thud as half the Sheriffs blackened
torso and head land in the dirt

That does it All the cops in town open fire at once
EXT ANNVILLE - NIGHT 137

Hugos cruiser skids to a stop the fireball from the
exploding car in town reflected in its windscreen Multiple

(

137

gunshots are heard Hugo exits the car staring at us
freaked

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET NIGHT 138

The cops are giving it maximum revolvers automatics Ml6s
scope rifles shotguns even a few SMGs the SWAT boys brought
along We move along the street from group to group -
deputies behind cars marksmen on the rooftops Dozens upon
dozens of shell casings rattle down on the street

Most of this actually misses the Saint ploughing up the
ground around him kicking dust high into the air Enough is
hitting him to stagger him knock him back At one point he
almost disappears in gunsmoke Then he brings both pistols
up and fires

One of the SWAT marksmen is hit his head exploding all over
his startled comrades

The second bullet ploughs into a shotgun held by a deputy and
the weapons shells detonate blowing the gun apart in his
hands He and the four guys around him are shredded by
buckshot very messy

The cops pause for a second staring

The Saint of course is still standing He waits a second
then fires again

One cop is flung backwards off a rooftop great arc of blood
flying up

Another is smashed through a storefront window in a spray of
shattered glass

Several cops resume firing but most can only stare
The Saint is hit repeatedly even as he returns fire

More cops fire back at him but several more break and run
like hell

One deputy cowers in a cruiser squealing into the radio He
winces as another guys bloody corpse is smashed against the
car

DEPUTY
Jesus Christ Sheriff Root please
respond Sheriff Root we have your
suspect in sight
(screaming)
Hes fucking killing every one of us

138

A gunshot then the window beside him shatters and the
windows nearer us are instantly painted dark red with blood
The car rocks on its suspension

The Saint continues his advance now a bit ragged - missing
chunks of meat from his chest holes in his hat and clothes
but still just grim unworried He ceases fire then points
one gun off to the side without bothering to look

Hes level with the town gas station level with one of the
pumps

He fires
The bullet smacks into one of the pumps
Several cops stare in amazement riveted

He cocks the gun fires again still not stopping still not
aiming walking right at us

The bullet sparks against the pump igniting the rushing
gasoline

He cocks the gun again
The cops gape A couple run but most are transfixed

The Saints eyes are full of hate total commitment not
wavering for an instant

The gun in his hand firing
The pump explodes

Pull way back as seconds later the whole gas station goes
up too A vast flaring explosion of burning fuel The
Saint is glimpsed for a second then the explosion reaches
out and he disappears in the flames

The cops stare faces lit by the flames

They they start to break and run Behind them the fireball
rises higher white and orange flaring Blazing fire begins
to rain down on the running cops Shouts and screams The
buildings are hit too catching fire

Several cops run around on fire screaming in horror dying
in agony

The Saint appears out of the fire a silhouette at first

Hes one fire himself back and shoulders burning He
resumes firing cutting down cops as they run 135

He walks right towards us and we can see his expression is
still unchanged as if nothing has happened

EXT ANNVILLE - NIGHT 139

The battered pickup pulls out and Jesse and Tulip exit
gaping at the burning town Distant screams and gunshots can
be made out

TULIP
You think it’s him

JESSE
It’s his MO

View from behind them with Annville burning away

Then we move in fast on Jesse At the last second he starts
to turn - and is smashed in the head with a 45 automatic He
grunts and drops like a stone

Its Hugo

HUGO
Say hello to justice you godfearin

Tulip freaks and goes for her pistol but only has it half-
way out of her purse when Hugo leans across the top of the
truck and points his gun in her face

HUGO
Go on an take it outta there whore
Put it on the truck an’ back away
Slowly

She complies very wary totally aware of the delicacy of her
situation

HUGO
Thats a good little beave

He knocks her pistol off the truck on his side His face
twists mean

HUGO

Hugo is about to move for her when Jesse raises his head

gritting his teeth the cut on his temple bleeding nastily
Hugo notices

JESSE
Son of a bitch-

HUGO
Goddamn

He puts his boot on Jesses head and stomps him face first
into the dirt Jesse grunts lies still

HUGO
You just lay there boy Dont want

orders

He turns back to Tulip only to find shes gone

HUGO
Shit

He searches the area peering into the night - then relaxes

Tulip is running hell for leather towards Annville
unfortunately silhouetted against the flames

Hugo smiles nastily takes careful aim

HUGO
Shoulda done like Daddy told you
ecunt-

He suddenly screams in agony a highpitched shriek and the
gun goes off into the sky with a huge bang Then he drops
it

Jesse still on the ground is grimacing hatefully and
clutching Hugo by the balls squeezing for all hes worth
Hugo keeps screaming

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 140
Tulip reaches the outskirts of town still a bit freaked out
trying to catch her breath after her mad dash to get away
from Hugo

She turns the corner into the main street to be greeted by a
scene of blazing destruction The buildings are on fire the
street is littered with corpses

Her eyes narrow as she peers into the distance

Down at the other end of the street we can just make out the
Saint finishing off the last of the cops One guy falls to
his knees The Saint puts his pistol to the guys head
Tulips eyes widen

The gun roars and the guy falls back dead all in silhouette

Tulip dodges back round the corner flattens herself against
the wall freaked

TULIP
Oh Christ
EXT ANNVILLE - NIGHT 142i

Hugo is flipped right round on the end of Jesses right hook
grunts with pain

A bad beating follows Jesse punches Hugo five times in the
face to knock him back once in the gut to bend him over

knees him in the face to snap his head back and then hooks a
hard left into his chin to send him flying back against the
truck All this in slightly over ten seconds

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 142

Tulip grimaces as more gunshots sound from offshot She
risks a peek round the corner again

No sign of the Saint Just the fire and the scattered
bodies

Her eyes narrow

Lots of guns on the street too holstered or otherwise

Tulip hesitates then steels herself and scurries out onto
the street

143 EXT ANNVILLE - NIGHT 143

Hugos pulped face comes through the truck window at us in a
spray of broken glass Jesse hauls him back out again
snarls hatefully into his face Hugo barely knows what
planet hes on

JESSE
You watch your goddamned mouth when
you talk about her

144 EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 144

Lit by the flickering flames Tulip moves from body to body
collecting guns She stuffs two automatics down the back of
her jeans shoves a revolver into her jacket another
automatic in the front of her jeans

Shes just picking up a gleaming silver 357 magnum when she
stops realizing the shooting and screaming have stopped
© All she can hear are the flames She looks up

The Saint stands watching her pistols holstered
emotionless Maybe twenty feet away

145 EXT ANNVILLE - NIGHT 145

Hugo is still conscious just about spitting blood gasping
hate Jesse holds him up by the collar

HUGO
I know what you are you son of a
bitchYoure a goddamned Washington

something out

His face twists hateful

(word of God)
Fuck yourself

Hugos eyes bulge in horror and terror

EXT ANNVILLE STREET 146

Tulip stands facing the Saint He hasnt moved yet The
last gun she picked up is not immediately visible

The Saint watches her calm

Tulips eyes are wide She clamps her mouth shut fights
panic

SAINT

Youre the Preachers woman aint
you I guess that means he made the
party You call him on in here an’
well have an end to this

TULIP
Whatwhat are you going to do-to
him

SAINT
What I do

Tulip freezes - then the fear leaves her face Cold fury
takes over She brings the 357 up at us fires

The bullet smashes into the Saints eyeball which bursts in

a spray of blood and jelly He clamps a hand to it staggers
round - and roars a hateful yell of fury and pain

EXT ANNVILLE - NIGHT 147
Jesse runs like hell for Annville anxious

JESSE
Tulip Jesus fuckin’ Christ Tulip

( )

147

Then more gunshots sound from the town Jesse doubles his
pace

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET — NIGHT 148
Tulip advances on the Saint blasting away with revolver and
automatic the 357 now discarded Hes bent over staggering
along the street hands to his face Blood pours out between
the fingers Each bullet knocks him a step further and
Tulip is really pouring it on A wild scene - lit by the
fires the diminutive girl shooting the hell out of the giant
gunfighter

The guns in her hands click as they run out She drops them
and smoothly pulls the two automatics from the back of her
jeans resumes firing

The Saints hat flies off Bullets smack into his head and
shoulders

Tulips face is set - scared but refusing to panic Total
determination She keeps firing

The Saint goes down on one knee struck repeatedly in the
head He holds one hand up as if to stop her A bullet
punches through it One hand still over his eye he roars
again

Tulip keeps firing grits her teeth

The Saint is holding himself up with his ruined hand

Tulip keeps firing Theres a click as one of the guns locks
dry She drops it takes careful aim with the other fires

The Saint starts to crumple

Tulip fires again

The Saint falls

The gun locks dry with a loud click

The Saint catches himself

Horrified Tulip lowers the useless gun

The Saint takes a moment breathes deep Then he slowly
crises from the half crouch she forced him into turns to face

her

Tulip can only stare petrified

148

The Saint takes the hand away from his face revealing the
butchered dripping empty eye socket

Tulip is ready to faint
The Saint grimaces then roars again

SAINT
Preacher

Jesse charges round the corner into the main street and stops
dead staring in horror

The Saint has one of his pistols pressed against Tulips
head His lip curls surly Tulip is frozen Both are
looking at Jesse

He freaks

JESSE
Tulip-

SAINT
(cocking the gun)
Not one more word or she goes to meet
her maker Youre a dead man but
she can still get out of this alive

Jesse clamps his mouth shut

SAINT
Now you come on in here Preacher

TULIP
Jesse dont Get out of here Run

Jesse walks forward ‘til hes about ten feet from the Saint
JESSE
(quiet)
Never again baby
She stares at him horrified
The Saint turns the gun on Jesse takes aim Tulip freaks
TULIP
You cant just kill him You said he
could find the answers here Hes

got a right to know what the hell it
is that happened to him 148

The Saint looks at her thoughtful Then his expression
hardens And he looks at Jesse again Jesse returns his
glare unafraid

SAINT

I aint got no answers I don’t know
why hes the one thats got to die
I dont know why that damn thing
chose him out of all the millions
that it couldve The ones who sent
me theyre the ones who know You
want answers Preacher Ask the
Angels

(indicating the gun)
All I got is this

TULIP
(breaking down)
It isnt fair I love him and
youre just gonna shoot him in the
street You rotten son of a bitch
youve got a fucking gun

The Saints eyes narrow mildly irritated

SAINT
»Come to that he has his goddamned
power He coulda told me to blow my
own head off or just keep walkin’
‘til I reached the moon or anything
he damn well pleased Just so
happened I was quicker

Jesse thinks hard
The Saint glares back at him a challenging look like Well
Jesse comes to a decision nods slowly Then keeping his
eyes locked on the Saints he takes his jacket off loosens
his collar
Tulips eyes pop
The Saint nods grim
SAINT
Makes no odds to me how you die boy
But you got some sand I will say

that

TULIP
For Christs sake 148

Jesse glances sadly at her then rolls up his sleeves

SAINT
Know this Preacher I see your lips
twitch - I hear one single syllable
of a single word were gonna find

pull the pistol

The Saint nods to Tulip
SAINT

wades right in

EXT DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 158

The pick-up races on down the road

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 159

Jesse crashes to the ground with sickening force The Saint
who just hit him is standing a good twenty feet away

Tulip watches horrified

Jesse gets to his feet as his opponent advances just in time
to punch the Saint in the jaw No effect Another one No
effect A fast combination right left right left right
to the guts left to the guts haymaker across the face No
effect The Saint backhands him across the face smashes him
against a burning police cruiser Jesse staggers spits
blood stays on his feet

They face each other for a moment Jesse hateful and defiant
the Saint just grim

The Saint comes at him again Jesse gets in a couple of
(useless) punches then dodges just in time and the Saint
punches his fist through the cruisers roof

Jesse karate chops him in the throat rolls backwards across
the cars hood kicking the Saint in the face as he goes
The Saint is actually staggered a bit Jesse lands on is
feet weaves in again

He runs right into the Saints hand which clamps down on his
hair yanking his head back The Saint then hauls him right

rough and sends him flying through a picket fence shattering
the boards

Jesse crawls in the wreckage of the fence trying to get it
together ‘The Saint is coming up behind

TULIP
Jesse

Just as the Saint bends down to seize hold of him Jesse
whips round and bashes the bastard across the face with a
length of two-by-four from the fence

The Saint stands upright

Jesse squints up at him

159

The Saint stands with the board hanging bizarrely from his
cheek with no visible means of support for it Its just
there Totally unperturbed he takes hold of the board with
no more effort than if he were brushing off a fly He looks
right at us

Jesse stares grimacing

The Saint pulls the board away from his face and we see what
was holding it there two four-inch nails now oozing red
blood as they leave the wounds Still cool as you like the
Saint drops the board to the side

SAINT
Kinda different

Then his face darkens and he seizes Jesse hauls him up and
Starts slapping the shit out of him Jesse takes about six
backhanders spits blood all over the place

The Saint flings him backwards and he crashes to the ground
a wreck

He lies still for a moment
Tulips face falls distraught This looks like it

The Saint sneers a little pulls his coat back from his
holster prepares to draw

Then Jesse gets up Very Slowly Spits out a tooth Faces
the Saint Smiles darkly

Even the Saint is a bit surprised but only for a second
Then his face darkens again and they close for more

Tulip is amazed then remembers -

TULIP
Go for his eyes

Jesse ducks a huge haymaker then stabs upwards with middle
and index fingers jams them right into the Saints gory
ruined eye socket The Saint roars in agony thrashes
wildly but Jesse keeps the fingers in there and twists and
grinds like mad putting all the strength hes got into it

The Saint furious grabs Jesses arm and slowly pulls the
fingers from his eye Jesse strains like mad but the Saint
is too strong

Then the Saint decks him with a horribly hard right and Jesse
hits the ground unconscious 159

Silence for a minute Tulip is so appalled she looks ready
to be sick The Saint looks down at Jesse Then he begins
drawing his gun
SAINT

Wasnt worth it boy Never woulda

made a goddamn bit of difference
Suddenly the little tableau is flooded with light
The Saint turns to see a pair of headlights bearing down on
him It turns out to be a rapidly closing pick-up truck
engine roaring
The Saints eyes narrow
Tulip stares

Jesse raises his head to look bewildered

INT TULIPS PICK-UP TRUCK NIGHT 160
Cassidy braces himself grits his teeth furious
CASSIDY

You
EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 161
Harshly lit by the headlights the Saint grimaces angrily
plants his feet hard on the ground throws his shoulders back
and braces himself for the impact (Jesse should not be lying

in the trucks path of course)

The Saint fumes and hates totally unafraid

INT TULIPS PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 162

CASSIDY
(screaming like a madman)
Yer Ma’s a Hooer

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET NIGHT 163

Massive impact huge crunch as the pick-up ploughs into the
Saint of Killers stops dead as it hits him and Cassidy is
flung through the windscreen and past the Saint in a spray of
flying glass

163

He sails through the air

A moments silence Tulips gaze follows the arc of his
fall

He crashes to the ground in a horribly hard impact ploughing
up the dirt Yells in agony then goes silent

Jesse turns painfully towards him

Cassidy raises his head turns towards Jesse with a face full
of broken glass Smiles weakly

CASSIDY
Youre rescued

Jesses eyes widen Then he slowly turns back to the Saint
Tulip turns to look that way too

The truck has rolled back a couple of feet a wreck Both
wheels have come off at the front The engine block and
panels are bent up off the chassis The hood is gone The
windscreen is shattered Steam hisses from the engine A
large foot-deep dent is dug into the fender and grille - the
engine itself has bent around the impact

The Saint stands unmoved rock solid staring at us with a

pissed-off glare The hood of the truck is embedded in his
stomach He takes a couple of deep breaths yanks the hood
from his guts and flings it away

His face sets hard in a grimace of pure hatred

SAINT
Right

He starts to draw his pistol

Jesses hand whips past the Saints coat from behind drawing
the second pistol

The Saint turns furious and amazed and freezes The
battered Jesse stands glaring at him presses the second
pistol into the Saints throat pushes his head back

The Saint has drawn the first gun but its obvious he’ll
never bring it up in time He cant believe this is
happening furious at Jesse and himself

JESSE
You drew first 163

Pissed off battered but full of savage triumph Jesse cocks
the pistol with a loud click The Saints eyes widen
furious

JESSE
I didnt say a goddamned word

He fires and blows the Saints brains clean out through the
top of his head

The Saint staggers back
Jesse watches eyes narrowed grim

The Saint glares back top of his head gone We can see
through the empty eye socket and out the back of his head
Hes as grim and mean as ever

SAINT
The hell with you

Then he drops to his knees and falls dead at Jesses feat

Jesse turns away drops the pistol starts walking towards
us

Tulip grabs him and the two embrace holding each other as
tight as they can for a long moment They kiss Eventually
Tulip breaks it stares up at him in amazement Jesse grins
back

TULIP
Youre crazy Youre totally fucking
crazy He could have ripped you in
half

JESSE
Wellthere were a couple of times
I gotta admit he maybe had me a
little worried

TULIP
(grinning)
Come here

They kiss again against the blazing inferno that used to be
Annville

Cassidy is trying to get up but is so weak hes only managed
to get as far as his hands and knees He struggles but
seems beaten Then he realizes that someone is holding a
hand out to him

( 163

Its Jesse He stands with his hand out serious Tulip
stands behind him watching Cassidy warily

Cassidy looks at the hand not sure what to make of it Then
he tentatively takes the hand and Jesse pulls him to his
feet

He stands rather unsteady Jesse glances over Cassidys
hideous wounds The two men face each other

JESSE
What I said ta you back at the bar
I was wrong I apologize

CASSIDY
JesseI‘m the one should be
apologizin I sold you out I
nearly got you killed

JESSE
But you set things right

Cassidy is quietly stunned Then he reaches out his hand
Jesse takes it and they shake

Tulip is leaning on Jesses shoulder

TULIP
I still think youre a prick

They both turn to her
TULIP
(smiling)
But a nice prick
They both grin
All three turn to survey the destruction Annville is on
fire from one end to the other and the street is littered
with dead cops

CASSIDY
Jesus Quite a party eh

JESSE
Quite a party

TULIP
At least you got that bastard

The Saints body lies in the street

163 163

Jesses eyes narrow

JESSE
No

Tulip is curious

JESSE
No I didnt

Theyre both curious as Jesse thinks to himself

JESSE
It wasnt him that caused this He
was just a goddamned errand boy

TULIP
What are you talking about

JESSE
He said it was the ones who sent him
remember He said if you want
answersask the Angels

© He turns and yells angrily into the night sky

JESSE
You bunch of assholes You get your
asses down here now You got a let
of shit to answer for

Tulip and Cassidy look at each other bewildered

JESSE

It was you did this to me You let
that murderin son of a bitch loose
to hunt me down Youre the ones
caused all this fuckin slaughter

(quieter fuming)
You know what I can do with this
goddamned power I got You
motherfuckers start talkin to me now
or you wont believe the shit that
Ill do next

Sudden silence The flames die away Then the whole place
is bathed in incredible otherworldy white light

Tulip and Cassidy cover their eyes but Jesse stares right

into the light

( 163

A huge figure forms above the town a beautiful angel that
glows with golden light wings spread wide It spreads out
its arms raises its face to the sky

Tulip and Cassidy are freaked
Jesse just looks suspicious

ANGEL (0S)
Then behold O mortals the glory of
the heavenly host

Jesse is not remotely impressed He lights a cigarette
flips the Zippo shut looks up again

JESSE
Cut the shit

The radiance fades The angel figure disappears Standing

in front of Jesse is a slim-featured guy in a white suit a
real-life ANGEL He looks a bit uncomfortable like a PR

guy who hasnt done his homework

ANGEL
Er

Tulip and Cassidy are totally freaked Jesse sneers a bit

JESSE
What the fuck are you supposed to be

ANGEL
I am an Angel of the Lord

JESSE

Then you got a lot of explainin to
do May as well get started

(word of God)
An’ dont you leave out a fuckin
word

back to normal)
Now what the hell is it thats
happened to me

ANGEL
Its something that should never have
existed It was born when an angel
a brother of mine fell in love with
a demon-bitch from Hell

JESSE
I saw that part

163 163

ANGEL
Nothing like it has ever happened
before There is a war raging in the
realms beyond your world One side
Heaven - on the other Hell

JESSE
Which aint necessarily the same as
good an’ evil right

ANGEL

(awkward)
---That war must never end Angels
and demons should never meet in
anything but battle And yet it
happened anyway We caught the
lovers not long after the birth and
had the Saint of Killers gun them
down - but their offspring proved
quite indestructible

He keeps talking face now melted into a shot of the rolling
silver clouds of Heaven as seen in Jesses mirror vision

ANGEL
We shut it away in a corner of
Heaven It was neither good nor
evil It was something new a
combination of them both We called
it Genesis

Now hes melted into a series of previous scénes - Genesis
ripping through Earths atmosphere hitting the Annville
church possessing Jesse destroying the congregation

ANGEL
It had no intelligence beyond a basic
sentience It escaped from Heaven
seeking a host - someone who could
act’ on its behalf who could use its
powersomeone who could speak for
it

He looks pointedly at Jesse whos deep in thought

JESSE
What does it want

ANGEL
It does not want It is what happens
when good meets evil It is an idea
It is a power for you to decide what
to do with 163

JESSE
An’ why me exactly

ANGEL
That I dont know Had you done
anything that might attract it

Jesse thinks about it

INT ANNVILLE CHURCH - DAY 164

Flashback to Jesse screaming at his congregation

JESSE
Give me a sign Give me some
incontrovertible proof that the
Almighty aint got His head shoved
firmly up His ass

EXT ANNVILLE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 165

Jesse considers

JESSE
Might have done

ANGEL
It needed a home that was all But
now listen to me And understand
We cannot let a power as strong’as
this run loose on Earth We must
return the entity to Heaven and lock
it in the dark forever Submit to us
- let us sever its bond with your
soul - and you may go in peace

JESSE
The fuck I will

ANGEL
(panicky)
You dont know what youre saying I
promise you that youll go free I
give you my word

JESSE
Your word aint worth dogshit on a
hot afternoon You set the Saint of
Killers on me an now hes fucked up
you think Im just gonna give myself
up like nothin happened Fuck

Jesse Tulip

JESSE (CONTD)
youNo I think theres more to
this that you aint sayin Like how
come God allowed this to happen a
thing bein born that never shoulda
How come he didn’t stop it himself

ANGEL
(on his knees terrified)
Oh not Oh please dont make me tell
Ill be destroyed for this In
Jesuss name have mercy

JESSE
Every Last Word

ANGEL
(breaking down)
The Lord God is gone

and Cassidy freeze A moment passes

JESSE
Aint quite the answer I expected
What the fuck do you mean hes gone

ANGEL
I mean he quit When Genesis was
born he left his throne in Heaven
He said he would go and live among
the mortals Here on earth

JESSE
How can God quit How can the world
keep goin

CASSIDY
I dunno I havent noticed that much
difference Maybe we just dont need
the fucker

Jesse thinks about that turns back to the shaky-looking
angel shrewdly raises an eye - Well

ANGEL
Humanity was not supposed to know

JESSE
Well theyre gonna find out pretty
fucking quickly believe me Im
gonna see to it

ANGEL
(perking up)
But how will you tell them Why
(MORE)

ili

ANGEL (CONTD)
should his flock believe he has
deserted them Why should the
atheists believe he is gone when
they never believed he was there in
the first place How do you convince
people that youre telling the truth

(pressing his advantage)

Remember the good folk of
AnnvilleReverend Custer

Jesse is stumped for a minute Then his eyes narrow again
and a nasty smile appears on his face

JESSE
Why would he leave just when Genesis
was born

ANGEL
(suddenly wary)

What
JESSE

Unless he was scared of it
ANGEL

Ah - now-
JESSE

Its as strong as he is aint it

Or maybe stronger You said it
yourself it was somethin’ new It
gave me the power to be obeyed If I
found the Lord God Almighty I could
make him face the people of the world
an own up to runnin’ out on them
Right

ANGEL
(appalled)
Not You cant Think about what
youre saying You cant give orders
to God You havent got the right

JESSE
I havent got the what

Sudden silence Jesse glares at the angel with steadily
mounting anger

JESSE
I havent got the right Fuck you
I gave my life to God just like my
Daddy did before me We never quit
on him We stuck by him an his Holy

Bible through thick an‘ thin no
matter how shitty a hand we got dealt
- an now youre tellin me I aint
got the right to face him down an
ask him what the fuck he thinks hes
doin
(furious losing it)
Seems to me asshole that I got all
the right in the goddamned world
Seems to me that every man an’ woman
on this planet has the right to say -
Hey Lord You been fuckin with us
from day one You been playin’
roulette with our fuckin’ lives
through ten thousand years of war
famine death an’ fucked-up shit So
maybe youd like to tell us when
youre finished movin’ in mysterious
fuckin’ ways
(screaming)
What the fuck do you mean by fuckin
guittin on us

Silence for a moment Tulip and Cassidy are very wary
waiting for whatever comes next Jesse fumes red-faced
The angel is shitting himself

ANGEL
The creation cannot make demands of
the creator

JESSE
Then the creator shouldnt shit on
his creation You wanna know how I
got the right to make demands of the
Lord Its ‘cause I got given the
power of God I know what its like
But all I did with it was the right
fuckin thing

ANGEL
But

JESSE
I have had enough of you ballsweat
You an your asshole pals in Heaven
youre responsible for this whole
fuckin’ bloodbath Well I been
thinkin’ if theres a heaven there
has to be the other place as well
right 165

ANGEL
(incredibly edgy)
Y¥-¥--YS

JESSE
(word of God)
Then you can go there

The angels eyes bulge in unbelievable horror He opens his
mouth to scream then bursts into bright red blazing flame
A terrible unearthly scream echoes around the place so loud
that our heroes have to clamp their hands to their ears -
then it fades into the distance as the if the screamer has
fallen down a deep deep hole until hes out of earshot The
angel is reduced to ash scattered on the breeze

Jesse looks grimly at it then turns away Cassidy looks at
him impressed

Our heroes peer out at him freaked beyond belief

The he pedals awkwardly up to Jesses side of the pick-up
truck and sticks his head in the window

INT STOLEN PICK-UP - NIGHT 273

All three stare at Arseface incredibly nervous Hes cheery
as ever

(Hullo)

Jesse recoils at the voice

ARSEFACE
(Sorry to trouble you folks but I
was wondering if youd seen my Dad
around here anywhere)

The three of them look at each other bewildered

(His names Hugo Root - hes the
Sheriff around these parts Tall

whisper to Cassidy)
What ‘the fuck is he sayin

CASSIDY
(starting to laugh
incredulous)
Well what the fuck are you askin’ me

Cassidy puts a hand to his mouth to hide his laughter That
gets Tulip going She leans back to try to hide behind
Jesse struggling not to howl with laughter When Jesse
turns back to Arseface he can barely contain himself teeth
gritted coughing over the occasional snigger

(
173

JESSE
Uhcome again

That almost puts Tulip and Cassidy over the edge A
herculean effort to stop themselves from laughing Arseface
is oblivious

ARSEFACE
(Im looking for my Dad Hugo Root
He‘s a member of the law enforcement
community He looks a bit like Jimmy
Stewart)

JESSE
Im sorry buddy I cant understand
a goddamned word you said

Arseface pulls a photo from his pocket hands it in
ARSEFACE

(My Dad see Im looking for my
Dad Thats him there with me)

The photo shows Arseface and Hugo together - Arseface with an
arm round his Dad giving the thumbs up Hugo looks
impossibly bitter fuming with hatred for the whole world

ARSEFACE
(See)

Jesse looks at the photo and all becomes clear

JESSE
Aaaaaah

He hands the photo to Tulip raises an eye Tulip and
Cassidy stare at it eyes popping
