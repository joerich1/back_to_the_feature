handhow does this work again

Then he remembers and ties them together extra-tight

KATE (CONTD)

Her gaze moves from the MIRROR back to the windshield-

A WRENCH is FLYING RIGHT AT HER-

face-level

The Woman looks worried then PULLS the HATCH down holding

KATE (CONTD)

The Woman LIFTS THE FLOOR COVER UP in the Hatchback
Then the vehicle DISAPPEARS around the CURVE of an Exit

IE CURVING EXIT - CONTINUOUS

Kate follows them into the curve CRANES her neck to see
around the trees

A metal CAR JACK skitters around the bend bouncing on the
asphalt Then a cardboard SPARE TIRE COVER follows it

Uh-oh They’re going to throw something else but Kate
won’t be able to see it until the last second She GRIPS
her wheel and CURLS around the blind bend BRACING HERSELF
It could happen at any second

pinball STEER GET CONTROL

Kate regains control STUNNED SHE ALMOST JUST WRECKED
She doesn’t breathe Looks ahead

And then GUNS it CATCHING UP with the Hatchback their
hatch now CLOSED

Her mind SCRAMBLED her limbs numb Kate is having serious
trouble BREATHING In fact she’s nearly HYPERVENTILATING

She thrusts her head back CONCENTRATE Breathe Breathe

Kate stares at her WEDDING RING as she clutches the wheel
Breathe She flips on the cold AC She gets control

She still can’t get over it -- THEY JUST TRIED TO KILL
HER She looks around for an indication that SOMEONE
ANYONE on the road is aware of this situation NOTHING

KATE (CONTD)
(looks around)
How can they do that How can they
just do that
(beat)
How does nobody know

Kate hits the RADIO AM NEWS Tuning through stations
DARTING HER EYES up at the road still Still in the chase

She finally gets a signal Some AM TALK RADIO PROGRAM

FEMALE TALK RADIO HOST (OS)
-and it’s ten ‘till the hour but

TRAFFIC GUY (OS)

everyday traffic report

TRAFFIC GUY (OS) (CONTD)

much to report Remember to watch
Wavy TV 8 for further updates or

Kate grips the wheel staring BLANK-EYED ahead of her
Nothing Nothing about her An ANNOYING RADIO COMMERCIAL
begins -- Kate doesn’t even register it

Up ahead the Hatchback turns on its LEFT TURN SIGNAL
Wha Kate moves up closer

The Hatchback suddenly BOLTS RIGHT and gets off at an EXIT
Kate doesn’t miss a beat FOLLOWING them right down the
exit She SMACKS the radio button -- OFF Why are they
going so SLOW Where are we going

EXT MOE’S GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

The Hatchback pulls into a GAS STATION It stops at a PUMP
and THE DRIVER (40’s thin lanky) immediately jumps out
He has a BASEBALL CAP pulled over his eyes SUNGLASSES

Oh God this is it Kate takes a DEEP BREATH as she bumps
over the curb into the Gas StationREADY FOR ANYTHING

As she pulls up the Driver raises a BLACK SHOTGUN AT HER---

JESUS She STOPS the van and instinctively ducks down
Nothing When she raises her head again

he tosses the shotgun to the ground Wait -- it wasn’t
a shotgun It’s a BLACK SQUEEGEE

He BLUFFED her And now he’s got his other arm STICKING
INTO THE BACK WINDOW of the Hatchback Behaving as though
he has a GUN to Frank’s head

DRIVER
Stay in the van

Kate is stopped at another gas pump cattycorner from them
From her vantage point she can’t tell if the Driver has a
GUN in that other hand or not She has every reason to
believe he’s bluffing her again but what if he’s not

Kate grabs her door handle--- about to get out---

The Driver reacts violently reaching his other arm into
the window

FRANK (0S)
DOON’T OWWWW

KATE
Okay

Kate CRINGES B-BEEPS her horn The Driver looks over
Kate puts her hands up for him to see -- “Okay okay
you’re in charge”

He eyes her suspiciously breathing heavy Frank is
CRYING

What can she do She sees a PAY PHONE at the curb Maybe
she could--

K-RUNK The PASSENGER DOOR opens and the WOMAN (big
heavy mid-forties gray hair) gets out a baseball cap
pulled down on her head She walks into the FOOD MART

The Driver stays right where he is arm in the window eyes
locked on Kate Kate can hear Frank CRYING in the
Hatchback She’s PARALYZED with indecision What should
she do

DING-A-LING Kate looks over to the FOODMART and sees an
ELDERLY FRIENDLY ATTENDANT walking towards her Huh
What the-

She looks up at her gas pump kiosk FULL SERVE 500

The Driver rubs his stubble NERVOUSLY He stares back at
Kate He discreetly put his fingers to his lips “SHH”

We hear Frank crying LOUDER Kate gulps and lowers her
hands to the dashboard as the Attendant gets to the van and
raps on her passenger window

OLD ATTENDANT
Howdy ma’am What can I top you
off with today

Kate is stiff as a board She cuts the engine Looks over
at the Attendant She shakes her head “no” at him trying
to somehow signal her distress

OLD ATTENDANT (CONTD)
Nothing What can I get fer ya
then just a quick checkup

Kate’s heart breaks as she hears Frank CRY They’ve got
her by the balls She nods to the Attendant

The Attendant goes to grab a Squeegee Kate sits facing
forward motionless Listening to Frank’s BAWLING CRIES
Locking eyes with the Driver Agonizingly impotent

Suddenly a SQUEEGEE drags SOAPY WATER across her
windshield OBSTRUCTING her view Then the Attendant leans
over the hood of the Minivan SQUEEGEEING her windshield
He nods his head back to the Hatchback with the screaming
kid

OLD ATTENDANT (CONTD)
(friendly)
Somebody’s tired of being in the
car huh

Kate smiles friendily She bites her lip Her magic
marker scrawlings are right underneath him on the
dashboard “DaTsuN Brown 280 280” She inches her quivering
hand across the dashboard and POINTS at the scrawlings
TAPPING her finger on them Trying to catch the
Attendant’s eyes LOOK Dammit LOOK

The Attendant doesn’t catch it Finished he moves back
behind the Minivan leaving her alone with the Driver
again

DING-A-LING The Woman comes out of the Food Mart with an
ice cream cone and a ROAD MAP Gets in the Hatchback

The Driver -- never taking his eyes off of Kate -- reaches
over with his free hand and opens his gas tank

Puts the nozzle in and starts pumping then resumes his
threatening position TENSED If he does have a gun in
there he looks like he’s ready to pull the TRIGGER at any
moment

--PFFFFSSHH WHA- Kate looks down The Attendant is
kneeled down by her driver’s-side TIRE putting air in
He’s RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR

OLD ATTENDANT (CONTD)
Like me to check yer tires

KATE
(nods )
Please

but she pronounces it “Police” in an attempt to send
him a message without openly subverting the Driver’s
orders It seems to have fallen on deaf ears

She eyes the Driver He’s watching her every move Can
she afford to try to speak again The Attendant’s right by
her window She has to try She opens her mouth

Then a CELL PHONE rings from inside the Hatchback The
ringtone “The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round”
The Driver looks inside curious

Kate is distracted for a just long enough that the
Attendant moves away to the rear tires Another chance
missed

A moment later the Woman holds Kate’s CELL PHONE out the
window of the Hatchback for Kate to see FUCK They
discovered it

Kate stares HOPELESSLY through her windshield The Driver
can see everything she does there’s no use

OLD ATTENDANT (0S)
Pop yer hood for me

Kate blinks A sudden glimmer of HOPE flashes across her
eyes She leans down and POPS her hood

The Attendant comes around the front of the van looking
for the latch Kate looks around inside the van What
can she do A MARKER HER POCKETBOOK Okay get
ready to make a move

KA-KRRUUUUNNK The Attendant OPENS HER HOOD It raises
up BLOCKING THE WINDSHIELD ENTIRELY

She instantly opens her purse grabs the marker gets out a
FIVE DOLLAR BILL and scrawls on it

CALL 911 SON KIDNAPPED -- BROWN DATSUN NO PLATES -- NOT A JOKE

The HOOD GOES DOWN Kate drops the marker and ASSUMES THE
POSITION again The Driver is now inside the Hatchback
watching her in his side-view mirror

OLD ATTENDANT (CONTD)
You know yer missin’ a muffler down
there Should really get that
replaced

Kate doesn’t say a word The Attendant shrugs

OLD ATTENDANT (CONTD)
Some other time then
(beat)
Allright no gas so that’s five
dollars even

Kate folds her FIVE DOLLAR BILL so he won’t see the note
yet She passes it to him but her eyes dart over to the
Hatchback as she does it The Driver notices her demeanor
He’s suspicious

OLD ATTENDANT (CONTD)
Thanks a bunch Have a nice day

The Attendant starts back towards the Food Mart Suddenly
the Driver gets out and walks towards him REACHING behind
his back

DRIVER
Hey

The Attendant stops OH GOD is the Driver going to kill
him The Driver takes out his WALLET

DRIVER (CONTD)
Think I could get change for a
five

OLD ATTENDANT
All I have’s a five

DRIVER
Oh that’s what I mean Can I
change a five
(digs through his
wallet)
Hold on a sec

The Driver jogs over to the Hatchback opens the door The
Attendant stands there waiting the 5 folded in his hand
He still hasn’t LOOKED at it Kate wants to just SCREAM AT
HIM LOOK AT IT LOOK AT IT

The Driver jogs back over holding out five 1 bills The
money changes hands and the Attendant nods walking away

DRIVER (CONTD)
Thanks

The Driver walks back to his Hatchback then stops He’s
READING the note she wrote on the bill OH JESUS

He looks up at Kate VENGEFULLY BARELY-CONTAINED RAGE

He angrily YANKS his door open and gets inside The
Hatchback STARTS UP Kate hears Frank BAWLING She
gnaws at a fingernail -- are they going to PUNISH Frank for
what she did

The Hatchback REVERSES and then PULLS UP BEHIND HER The
Driver HONKS his horn and points to the EXIT Kate
obediently starts her engine KICKING HERSELF

She noses towards the exit and the Hatchback crawls right
behind her She stops at the road and finds herself right
next to that PAY PHONE It’s just TAUNTING her

HOONNNK HONNNNK The Hatchback impatiently flashes its
brights at her flipping on its turn signal as an order
She obeys and pulls out of the Gas Station

So many chances and she FAILED Kate’s eyes tear up Why
didn’t she say somethingdo something

KATE
Stupid

Her GAS GAUGE shows her at just above a QUARTER TANK

KATE (CONTD)
(wipes her eyes)
You’re so stupid

The Hatchback FLASHES ITS BRIGHTS Flips on its RIGHT TURN
SIGNAL Kate gets the message Turns right They head
back up the HIGHWAY ONRAMP

EXT BRIDGE-LIKE ONRAMP - CONTINUOUS

Kate squints pulls down her sun visor Paperclipped to
the sun visor is a PHOTO FRANK on his first day of
school Kate can’t hold the tears back CURSES HERSELF

KATE
Why didn’t you do anything Youre
so stupid

They approach the highway The Hatchback nearly SIDESWIPES
Kate as it pulls past her to merge onto the highway
WHHHOOA The Hatchback almost merges right into a TRAILER
TRUCK

KATE (CONTD)
Oh God Oh baby

Kate sucks in air as the Hatchback clumsily corrects itself
and takes off down the highway

KATE (CONTD)
Oh God Oh God You can’t do this
anymore You’re gonna get him
killed That’s why people don’t do
this Kate They call the police

Kate hits buttons on her GPS and ICONS appear on her map
She hits the nearest one

GPS (VO)

lane To take Next exit

Kate bites her knuckle then nods She’s right This is
the right answer Flips on her turn signal

Tik tok tik tok tik tok tik tok

Kate glances up at that PHOTO Frank’s staring at her as
if to ask “Where are you going Mommy”

KATE

the police and then we’1ll be right
back to get you okay

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The TWO VEHICLES zoom down the highway The scenery is
becoming more RURAL There’s no other traffic around

INT MINIVAN (MOVING)

Kate can’t bear to have Frank staring at her She CLOSES
the visor Wipes her eyes Don’t start saying your
goodbyes just yet Concentrate What can you do She
TURNS on the radio again searches through the fuzz

RADIO (0S)
-live footage of a police pursuit
in Forsyth County involving a white
minivan

KATE
UUUHHH OH OHH

the windshield for a helicopter

minutes ago

the window again

STATIC Kate is too shell-shocked to even cut it off
WEIRDO CREEPY RADIO STATIC fills the Minivan

The TREES beside her open up and reveal “WATER COUNTRY
USA” a big FAMILY-THEMED WATERPARK A big CARTOON
CHARACTER welcomes visitors at the entrance

Kate obviously recognizes this kid-friendly place She
looks over at the giant WATER SLIDES twisting up into the
air in the distance The CREEPY RADIO STATIC puts her into
a zone her mind drifting for just a moment

FLASH Kate teaching Frank how to swim at the water park
Splashing Having a great time

Kate SNAPS out of it and looks forward The Hatchback is
slowing down to where she’s almost TAILGATING it She
lowers her speed Why are they doing this

She passes a sign with the Cartoon Character pointing
“Where are you going WATER COUNTRY USA is back there”
This prompts her to unconsciously glance up at her rearview
mirror

-WAIT What’s that back there Waaaay back behind
her That dot

A MOTORCYCLE Is it

KATE
Oh God please

She adjusts her mirror Oh yes that telltale windshield

A MOTORCYCLE COP is casually heading towards them on the
interstate

KATE (CONTD)
Oh Oh God
(out the window)
HELP HELP

Kate’s not letting this one get away She smacks her
FLASHERS on grabs her STEERING WHEEL and YANKS it left

The Minivan jerks LEFT going offroad then SWERVES right
LIGHTS BLINKING SWERVING RECKLESSLY she looks like the
DRUNKEST driver youve ever SEEN

The Motorcycle Cop’s LIGHTS turn on He’s coming for her

YES YES Ahead the Hatchback keeps going at the speed
limit trying to act like nothing’s out of the ordinary

The Motorcycle Cop pulls up behind her trying to flag her
down She WAVES for him to come up beside her He
refuses motioning for her to pull over

KATE (CONTD)
NO Come up here
(leans out her
window)
HELP COME HERE

The Motorcycle Cop finally pulls up beside her

MOTORCYCLE COP
(WIND RUSHING PAST)
Pull over

KATE
(WIND RUSHING PAST)
HELP They have my son (beat)
Kidnappers

MOTORCYCLE COP
Pull over

KATE
(points at the
Hatchback)
NOT ME THEM IT’S THEM

The Hatchback moves into the left lane like a good
deferential citizen Kate ACCELERATES pulling up next to
the Hatchback She POINTS at it and SCREAMS at the Cop

KATE (CONTD)
PULL THEM OVER

The Motorcycle Cop drives up noting the Hatchback’s
missing license plate He pulls up in between the two
vehicles

MOTORCYCLE COP
(to Hatchback)
Pull over
(to Kate)
You too Pull over

Behind him the Hatchback suddenly SWERVES TOWARDS US--

KATE
LOOK OUT

The Hatchback CRUSHES THE MOTORCYCLE COP AGAINST KATE’S
MINIVAN

Kate SCREEEAMS She turns her wheel away from them but
the Hatchback stays AGAINST her and in a confusing MESS
they all three go off the SHOULDER OF THE ROAD

INT MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

Like riding a rollercoaster we stare through the
windshield as Kate goes off the shoulder and TUMBLES down a
GRASSY EMBANKMENT The minivan RUMBLES like crazy barely
staying upright Kate BOUNCES VIOLENTLY up and down in her
seat even hitting the ceiling once Her airbag GOES OFF
and hits her in the face

EXT VALLEY UNDER THE OVERPASSES - CONTINUOUS

The Minivan comes to a STOP Dazed Kate pushes down her
rapidly-deflating AIRBAG surprised when it SINGES her
fingers

She examines her surroundings Both cars have tumbled down
the embankment into a muddy VALLEY CONCRETE SUPPORT BEAMS
rise from the grass and go a hundred feet in the air to
RAISED HIGHWAY OVERPASSES

The Hatchback is stopped too about 50 feet ahead of her

She leans out her window and looks back up at the twisted
wreckage of the motorcycle hidden in the tall grass and
shrubs The Cop’s body is sprawled out in a grotesque
broken pose They killed him They KILLED him Oh God
Oh God

The Hatchback’s door suddenly OPENS The DRIVER gets out
Faint CHILDREN’S SONGS emanate from inside the car The
Woman snaps at him He bends down into the car hiding
behind the door

He stands up again wrapping his SHIRT around his FACE like
some kind of MUJAHADIN

Kate opens her door her engine still RUNNING She
carefully steps out to negotiate

KATE
Why did you do that
(no answer)
What do you want

The CHILDREN’S MUSIC suddenly turns up LOUD to where it’s
echoing in this valley Loud enough to cover up any NOISE

The masked Driver starts walking towards the Minivan

Kate thinks twice about this and gets back in the van

The Driver breaks into a RUN towards her Kate GASPS and
SHUTS HER DOOR The Driver pulls out a KNIFE and leans
down towards her FRONT TIRE

Kate JERKS the van into REVERSE and LURCHES BACKWARD MUD
SPRAYS into the air The Driver CHASES her tire KNIFE

extended

She gets a SAFE DISTANCE from him The Driver is still
coming after her

Wait a second

She puts the van into DRIVE
The Driver hears the gear change -- uh oh
She DRIVES FORWARD RIGHT AT HIM

The Driver turns and RUNS from her She STEERS towards
him He RUNS laterally finally STEERING HER OUT in the
thick mud

Now she’s close to him again and he goes for those tires
SHIT--- Kate REVERSES just in time with such an abrupt
JOLT that her transmission lets out a loud “KREECH”

He keeps chasing those tires JUUUUSSST out of his reach
Kate gets a safe distance from him then throws it back
into DRIVE

The Driver stumbles backward and runs from her again Kate
GUNS after him steering even better this time He is
forced to run behind one of the CONCRETE BEAMS and hide
behind it as if it were “BASE” Kate STOPS before she
would hit the beam

They look at each other The Driver is visibly OUT OF
BREATH The blaring Children’s Music lends an air of
ABSURDITY to their standoff

He steps out from behind the beam mud-soaked making a
half-hearted try for those tires one more time

Kate goes into REVERSE and just stays on it getting a
HEALTHY DISTANCE between herself and these people

About seventy feet away from them she STOPS

The Driver runs after her for a bit and finally stops and
puts his hands on his knees TOTALLY HEAVING out of
breath He’s now about equidistant between both stopped
vehicles Kate can FEEL his exhaustion

Kate leaves the engine running and STEPS OUT OF THE VAN
again Carefulready to jump back in at any second

KATE (CONTD)
(yells)

The Driver looks back at her his face still covered Kate
reaches in the Minivan She pulls out her POCKETBOOK
Holds it up for him Takes out her WALLET holds it up for
him

KATE (CONTD)
There’sgodthere’s only sixty
dollars in this But I have
credit cards 10000 dollar
limits You can access everything
I have in the bank between these
cards My pin number is 1015

She feels stupid butgotta try anyway She THROWS HER
WALLET as far as she can It BOUNCES open in the muddy
grass near the Driver

KATE (CONTD)
If you let him go I won’t chase
you anymore All I want is my son
I don’t care about anything else
I don’t know your license plate I
haven’t seen your face You can
get away I’11 tell them I don’t
know anything

The Driver notes the WALLET He looks back at the
Hatchback

KATE (CONTD)
Take it My address is in there
You think I’m going to lie to you
if I know you have my address If
you try that pin number and it
doesn’t work you can come to my
house and kill me any time you ever
want You think I’m going to lie
to you You think I’m going to
risk that

The Driver looks like he’s considering her proposition
Suddenly he BREAKS INTO A RUN towards Kate

Kate JUMPS into her Minivan shuts the door Puts it in
REVERSE --

Before she can even take her foot off the brake the Driver
STUMBLES and changes direction anticipating that she’s
going to charge at him again He SLIPS in the mud and
FALLS ON HIS ASS

He gets to his feet EMBARRASSED that she saw that He
runs back to the Hatchback

WOMAN
Get the wallet

The Driver snatches up Kate’s wallet and THEN runs back to
the Hatchback

Kate is TAKEN ABACK at this display Who are these people

The Hatchback SMOKES out of the grass and back towards the
ACCESS ROAD Kate SNAPS back into action and GUNS THE
ENGINE after them shaking her head in disbelief
Something has changed in her demeanor

INT MINIVAN (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

The opening DROPS of a LIGHT RAIN start PATTERING on Kate’s
windshield She watches the Hatchback incredulously

KATE

(she realizes

something)
This has never happened to you
before has it

(beat)
No one’s ever chased you like this

(beat)
You don’t know what to do do you
You don’t have a plan for this
Just trying to get away Probably
as scared as I am

Kate sits up in her seat as she follows them back onto the
HIGHWAY This is working She’s psyching herself up She
pulls down her sun visor and addresses herself in the

mirror FRANK’S PHOTO making it feel like they’re TOGETHER

It takes Kate a second to recognize her own voice it’s
really really faint As soon as she does she REWINDS

We hear HIGH-PITCHED CHIPMUNK GOBBLEDY-GOOK as it REWINDS
further and further She randomly presses PLAY

The sound is WARBLED We hear some sort of KIDS’ CARTOON
Mixed with elevator music Kate’s about to rewind

her own voice very faint

She STOPS it Goes through a severe emotion

She EJECTS the mini-cassette and POCKETS it Her SHAKING
HAND fishes out another cassette from the messy floor
Puts it in

EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The HIGHWAY spans along some ROCKY OUTCROPPINGS Through
the RAIN-SOAKED windshield we see Kate SPEAKING into the
tape recorder pouring out her heart to her son

Kate HITS THE GAS and pulls up on the Hatchback’s RIGHT
SIDE She BLASTS HER HORN and SCREAMS OUT AT THEM

KATE (CONTD)
HEYYY I CALLED THE POLICE

She grabs the VOCODER and holds it up to her ear like it’s
a CELL PHONE Looks convincing enough

KATE (CONTD)
I CALLED THE POLICE LET HIM GO

She doesn’t care if they buy it or not As long as they’re
DISTRACTED while they pass under this SIGN

We see it pass over us
LAST EXIT BEFORE TOLL BOOTH - 14 MILE

Kate can’t believe this Now she just has to stay to
their rightkeep them from EXITING

The Hatchback suddenly GASSES and VEERS for the EXIT Kate
SWOOPS UP next to them BLOCKING their EXIT The Hatchback
tries to BRAKE and sneak behind her Kate BRAKES too
preventing them from moving over

They PASS the exit SHE DID IT

Kate CLAPS HER HANDS in anticipation It’s too good to be
true

There it is The TOLL BOOTH appears up ahead a MANNED
BARRICADE stretching the full width of the highway

KATE (CONTD)
HAAAAAA

Kate is ECSTATIC The Hatchback SLOWS unsure of what to
do Kate SMACKS her steering wheel with JOY

The highway starts to SPREAD OUT for the upcoming Toll
Booth The Hatchback hesitantly MOVES over into the far-
left lane alongside the concrete divider

It slows to a crawl Its HAZARD LIGHTS come on Kate
follows right behind them unbuckling her seatbelt-

It finally STOPS right there in the lane a hundred feet
from the Toll Booth Frozen in indecision

Kate STOPS right behind them throws it in PARK and JAMS
on her horn She opens her door WAVING HER ARMS

KATE (CONTD)
(to toll booth)
HELLP

As she gets out the Hatchback’s REAR HATCH suddenly OPENS
UP sticking into the air

INSIDE the DRIVER is in the back with Frank in his lap and
that giant HUNTING KNIFE in his hand Eyes on Kate

Kate GASPS Frank SCREAMS reaching out to her

KATE (CONTD)

The passenger-side door of the Hatchback opens and the
WOMAN climbs out CALM yet DEADLY SERIOUS

The Woman closes the rear hatch of the Hatchback She
lifts up her shirt for Kate

WOMAN

She opens Kate’s passenger door

WOMAN (CONTD)
Come on Talk to me

The Woman gets into Kate’s van and closes the door leaving
Kate standing out here on her own Kate watches a car ZOOM
by them towards the Toll Booth

To any observers this situation appears perfectly
innocuous -- a Hatchback is broken down on the side of the
road and a Minivan has stopped to help them out

DRIVER (OS)
(muffled from inside
Hatchback)

TELL HER TO GET IN THE CAR

WOMAN
Kate DO WHAT HE SAYS Get in

The Woman lets go of the seatbelt Kate BREATHES in air

The Woman rolls her window down sticks out her arm and
WAVES to the Hatchback

KATE (CONTD)
What are you telling him

There is long beat and then the Hatchback’s HAZARD
LIGHTS go off It starts to move forward

KATE (CONTD)
Does that mean Frank’s okay

The Woman crawls back behind Kate’s seat

WOMAN
Follow them

Kate puts it in DRIVE DRIVING SLOWLY behind the Hatchback

A hefty arm reaches up and adjusts Kate’s rearview mirror
so the Woman can see her eyes

The TOLL BOOTH now towers over their heads a giant DAM
they are about to leak through The Hatchback is at the
Booth The Driver reaches out the window paying the TOLL
BOOTH GIRL

TOLL BOOTH GIRL
(far up ahead)
Everything alright Thought you
broke down

We faintly hear the Driver give some explanation He
points a thumb back at the Van The GIRL nods

The TOLL BAR lifts up and the Hatchback goes through The
Toll Booth Girl waves for Kate to go on through

WOMAN
He paid for us Go through Go

Kate presses the gas softly She longingly gazes at the
TOLL BOOTH GIRL as she passes but the Woman’s eyes are
on her the whole time

THEY PASS THROUGH Kate watches the Toll Booth get smaller
in her rearview mirror Another golden opportunity --
LOST How many more can she hope to get

WOMAN (CONTD)
(climbs back into the
passenger seat)
Pull up next to him

Kate pulls up alongside the Hatchback The hefty Woman
leans out the passenger window She yells out to the
Hatchback The wind is rushing so LOUD that Kate can’t
make out what they’re saying

KATE
What’s happening
The Woman climbs behind the seat again

WOMAN
The first exit has a Bank of
America Are you Bank of America

KATE
Yes

WOMAN
We’re gonna get off and go to Bank
of America They’re gonna go
somewhere else and wait

KATE

In case you try something I can
call him

KATE
I won’t Then how do I get him
back

Silence Kate tries to see her in the mirror
reaches up and jerks the mirror upward

WOMAN
Don’t look at me any more

KATE
How do I get him ba-

WOMAN
I‘1l call him and tell him to drop
him off at a 7-Eleven somewhere
(beat)
Here’s your exit

The Woman

Kate can’t see the Woman can’t get a bead on her Here’s

the EXIT -- The Hatchback keeps going
Is she really going to let it drive away

KATE
How do I know you’1l tell him that

WOMAN
‘Cause if not for me he would’ve
thrown him out on the interstate a
long time ago
(beat)
Get off

Kate considers her options and then turns the Minivan down
the exit The Hatchback continues down the highway
unchaperoned

EXT LONELY ROAD W TUNNELS -— CONTINUOUS
We’re on a lonely road ORANGE CONES mark a CONSTRUCTION
AREA that looks like it hasn’t been touched for months and

months

KATE
Where do I go

WOMAN
Just go straight

They pass through a short TUNNEL as an old TRAIN passes by
overhead This doesn’t look like Bank of America turf

WOMAN (OS) (CONTD)
Just keep going straight I’1l tell
you where to go
(beat)
Okay You’re doin’ good
Kate hasn’t seen a car or any sign of civilization
The Woman SHUFFLES behind her Looking around

WOMAN (CONTD)

Hold on We might have missed
the turn

KATE
Huh

WOMAN (OS)

Slow down for a second
Kate lets off the gas Feeling very bad about this

Kate gets PUNCHED IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD

MOM
Wait-

WOMAN (OS)
You okay

MOM

What

The Woman PUNCHES HER AROUND THE SEAT AGAIN HARD

The Woman PUNCHES HER THREE TIMES FAST IN THE SIDE OF THE
HEAD

Kate is trapped in her own seat getting PUMMELLED from
overhead Her vision goes blurry

The Woman LEANS OVER KATE’S SLUMPING FORM and takes the
WHEEL coasting them over to the side of the road

Kate OPENS HER EYES WIDE trying to stay conscious “Shes
going to kill me here”

Kate PUSHES down on the gas

The Woman FEELS IT and PUNCHES Kate TWICE HARD Kate
FROWNS and STOMPS ON THE GAS The Woman STEERS them away
from the shoulder JUST IN TIME

Kate puts her HAND on the Womans face and TAKES THE WHEEL
The Woman STRUGGLES with Kate as the Minivan SHOOTS down
the road -- OUT OF CONTROL

Kate blindly GRABS the Womans FLANNEL OVERSHIRT and PULLS
IT OVER THE WOMAN’S HEAD so she can’t see

The Woman untangles herself from her flannel overshirt and
throws it off entirely She ATTACKS--

Kate BRAKES then GASSES HARD The Woman FALLS BACK behind
Kate’s seat

Suddenly the SEAT BELT CONSTRICTS AROUND Kate’s NECK The
Woman is STRANGLING HER WITH IT from behind

WOMAN (OS)
Stop the van

Kate defiantly STEPS ON IT

IE LONELY ROAD W TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

They are BARRELING DOWN THIS NARROW ROAD NOW They ALMOST
CRASH INTO THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE They SCRAPE against the
TUNNEL WALL

Kate’s face goes RED from lack of oxygen Everything
through the windshield is becoming BLURRY

Kate’s hand randomly feels aroundfinds the RECLINING
HANDLE

Kate PULLS THE HANDLE Her SEAT FALLS BACK to a HORIZONTAL
POSITION Her neck is FREED

Instantly the Woman CLIMBS OVER TOP of Kate and GRABS THE
WHEEL

Kate LASHES OUT AT HER ANIMALISTIC She sees the Womans
VERICOSE-VEINED THIGH in front of her face Kate BITES HER
TEETH INTO IT The Woman HOWLS

Stumbling in blind pain the Woman falls against the door
with all her weight Kate thinks fast She grabs the DOOR
HANDLE and yanks it

The DOOR OPENS The Woman FALLS into the DOOR and then
RIGHT OUT OF THE VAN

Kate SITS UP and REGAINS CONTROL of the wheel She checks
her sideview mirror in DISBELIEF

The Woman ROLLS on the ground for a moment Even as she
gets smaller and smaller Kate sees her GET TO HER FEET and
CHASE AFTER THE VAN Screaming obscenities while she runs
at top speed

KATE
(can’t believe it)
Huhhhuhh HAAAH HAAAAHH

Kate lets out a brief CHEER despite herself She stomps on
the gas leaving the Woman in the dust TURNS LEFT goes
through one last tunnel and STOPS

Up ahead at the Highway Entrance the HATCHBACK is waiting
It is stopped facing towards a HIGHWAY ENTRANCE engine
running blinkers on next to a BLUE EMERGENCY PHONE on the
side of the highway WAITING

Kate’s mind races She grabs the Womans FLANNEL SHIRT and
PULLS IT ON over her arms She rolls down her window
WAVES her FLANNEL-COVERED ARM out the window -- “OK”

God please let him buy this

Kate looks in her sideview mirror -- OH SHIT

Behind her the Woman is RUNNING TOWARDS THEM The Woman
is still safely in the tunnel out of the Hatchback’s view
but she’s coming FAST SCREAMING

Up ahead the Hatchback’s BRAKE LIGHTS go out It EASES up
to the Highway waiting for a clear moment to get on Hes

BUYING it

KATE
Come on come on

Kate NUDGES the Hatchback along She checks behind her

The Woman is ALMOST OUT OF THE TUNNEL WAVING HER HANDS
AND SCREAMING

Then the Hatchback turns going onto the Highway He
didn’t SEE her Kate FOLLOWS him fast trying to get them
the hell out of there

Kate shoots one last look at the Woman RUNNING OUT IN THE
ROAD behind them CLEAR AS DAY

And then she’s out of sight

IE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kate CATCHES HER BREATH

and it DAWNS ON HER that for the first time today

she has the UPPER HAND The Driver thinks she’s the
WOMAN

She passes a SIGN STATE LINE Unbelievablethey’ve
gone so far

She passes another SIGN

REST STOP
1 MILE

A REST STOP She nods Okay here goes

Kate MOVES the Minivan left and ZOOMS PAST THE HATCHBACK
She PULLS IN FRONT of the Hatchback

Kate flips on her TURN SIGNAL for the REST STOP She
adjusts her rearview to see the Hatchback behind her

The Hatchback turns on its TURN SIGNAL as well

OH MY GOD It’s WORKING Kate SITS UP in her seat
licking her lips-

Suddenly the Hatchback’s TURN SIGNAL goes OFF

The Hatchback moves over and ZOOMS UP BESIDE the VAN

Kate DUCKS DOWN LOW and BRAKES The Hatchback tries to
DRIVE BESIDE HER Kate BRAKES until she is able to PULL
BEHIND the Hatchback

The Rest Stop COMES and GOES

Kate SWEATS BULLETS in her seat The Hatchback SLOWS DOWN

in front of her Kate nervously PULLS DOWN her SUN VISOR
to block her face

The Hatchback suddenly BLASTS FORWARD AWAY FROM HER

NO She HITS THE GAS and CHASES IT

Kate is FULLY PANICKING NOW If the Driver thinks she’s
done something to the Woman what if he goes crazy What
if he takes it out on Frank

They ZOOM down the highway

Then the Hatchback SLOWS Kate catches up practically
TAILGATING THEM The DRIVER leans his head out his window
- LOOKS AT HER

DRIVER
STOP STOP THE CAR

Kate can’t help but shake her head “no”

DRIVER (CONTD)
STOP YOUR CAR

KATE
WATCH WHERE YOU’RE GOING Oh God

The Driver sees she’s not listening His head goes back
in Then his foot pushes his DOOR OPEN holds it open

What the hell----
FRANK’s head appears in the door SCREAMING

Then his TORSO and ARMS---

A terrified Frank SCREAMS for Kate to “STTOOPPP”

Kate’s HEART STOPS That’s it She THROWS UP HER HANDS in
submission and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

The Minivan SMOKES ITS TIRES SQUEALING across the road
The Driver pulls Frank back inside as the Hatchback gets
further away

Kate finally comes to a STOP in the middle of the road
She YANKS out her keys and holds them up for him to see

The Hatchback VANISHES down the highway the Driver’s door
closing back up

Kate sits in the car both hands up trying to breathe air
that just isn’t there Finally it comes

TOTAL SILENCE She looks down the empty road in an
UNBROKEN DAZE

The Hatchback is GONE

Kate opens her door and STEPS OUT of the Van She STAGGERS
onto the highway as if she’s lost

An SUV BLARES ITS HORN as it ZOOMS RIGHT BY HER She
barely even registers it

She gets back into the van SITS THERE Her eyes well up
with tears

On the floor is a crumpled CRAYON DRAWING Frank gave her
earlier today -- “HAPPY MUTHER’S DAY MOMMY”

She lets out a sick GURGLE and then HUNCHES OVER and
BAWLS She CRIES SO LOUD alone in the Van Everything
she’s felt all day EXPLODES out of her

She wipes her eyes and STARTS THE VAN again Her SHAKING
fingers try to pull up the GPS screen and accidentally
turn on the DVD player as well Frank’s “The Little Engine
That Could” DVD starts up

She drives the Minivan across the GRASS MEDIAN and sadly
heads the other direction down the highway

Kate passes a sign

REST STOP

She proceeds into the exit lane
EXT REST STOP - CONTINUOUS
Kate pulls down the long wide road into the REST STOP
DVD NARRATOR (OS)

“T thought I could I thought I

could”
She SHUDDERS Approaches the rest stop
She sees a few other FAMILY CARS and VANS parked down
there One has its back gate open where a DAD is loading
a CHILD’S CARSEAT into the van A few CHILDREN are walking
around

Kate looks back at Frank’s EMPTY CARSEAT

Something CLICKS OVER in her head

KATE
NOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOO HLL

She ZOOMS through the parking lot Bystanders JUMP to the
sidewalk

Kate ACCELERATES back onto the Interstate and BLASTS across
the median She gets back on the other side and TEARS DOWN
THE ROAD after her son

She CUTS off the DVD Passes by the spot where she stopped
earlier keeps going

She glances at her GPS SCREEN Up ahead the highway FORKS
IN TWO OH NO OH NO

IE FORK IN HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kate slows down as she approaches the FORKwhat does she
do She COASTS forward in indecision

Slowing to about 15 mph until she’s rolling straight
towards the V-shaped GUARD RAIL

Finally she chooses RIGHT She PICKS UP SPEED praying
Empty empty highway She looks down at that GPS screen
watching her ONSCREEN ICON moves away from the FORK God
please let this be the right way

A SIGN AHEAD “EXIT - 14 mile” Should she take it Did
they exit or keep going

The EXIT gets closer Make a decision
She bites the bullet and EXITS
EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

The Minivan pulls up to a dirty CONSTRUCTION SITE at the
bottom of the exit A WORK CREW mills around

KATE
Hey HEY HELP

A couple of MEXICAN LABORERS hear her and jog over
KATE (CONTD)

(yells)
Did anyone see a car come by here

The Laborers motion for her to wait They jog back over to
the site Kate waits in the Van feeling every precious
second tick by The Laborers are conversing looking over
at her

Finally the one guy SHAKES HIS HEAD and SHRUGS to her
Kate quickly REVERSES turns around and HEADS BACK TO THE
HIGHWAY She drives the WRONG WAY up the exit she just
came off of FUCK IT No time No time

IE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Minivan pulls back onto the highway DOUBLE-TIMING
Kate wipes her eyes feeling it all coming back again TWO
CARS PASS HER on the left FLYING BY We haven’t seen the
Hatchback for minutes and minutes

She looks down at her GAS GAUGE less than 18 of a tank
left This charade will be over soon whether she likes it

or not

Oh God she’s lost him for good She goes up a hill comes
around a CURVE

--AND SEES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING SHE’S EVER SEEN

She STEERS off of the road and starts DRIVING IN THE
GRASSY MEDIAN LOOKS OUT HER WINDOW slowly passing by the
traffic and TRYING TO FIND THE HATCHBACK amongst the
stopped cars It’s gotta be here It’s gotta be

INT POLICE STATION

A SHOCKINGLY NORMAL office notable only for how SMALL and
EMPTY it is Not the typical hundreds-of-crowded-desks-
with-plainclothes-cops-working-the-books -- this feels more
like a quiet sanitized FED EX dropoff Sterile White

Kate sees a LONE SINGLE POLICEWOMAN sitting at a desk

POLICEWOMAN

KATE
Mymy son was kidnapped
(it sounds so weird
coming out of her
mouth)

high-speed and everything around her is moving TOO SLOW
We feel her losing momentum with every second she’s here

KATE
They’re not at a hospital
(beat)
I think they have my cellphone

something and find them

POLICEWOMAN
We can trace it to the tower that
picks up the call and triangulate
it between the three nearest-

KATE
Can we do that

POLICEWOMAN
-but we’re going to wait for the
detective he is on his way right
now

KATE
Why Do you know how to do it
Can you do it

POLICEWOMAN
Because we have to call the phone
to establish a trace and we may
only get one chance to make this
call So we need to record it we
need to have the detective on the

INT MINIVAN (MOVING)

Kate puts her Minivan in DRIVE Drives along those

storefronts to the first CORNER

KATE
You’d turn the corner the first
chance you got Get out of sight
Get a row of buildings between you
and the highway

She pulls to the intersection Looks both ways

Which

way She looks back at the footprint trail It’s about

square-even with the sidewalk on her left
So she turns LEFT
She passes a BANK a couple JEWELRY STORES

KATE (CONTD)
There’s no point in even hiding in
a store ‘cause this whole area
will be crawling with cops soon
You have to get out of this town
Fast How do you do that A bus
A bus station Steal a car

She hits her GPS Presses a “BUS” icon “SEARCHING”

On her right the buildings end and there’s a GRASSY PARK

area Lots of trees lots of shade

KATE (CONTD)
Youre too noticeable on the
sidewalks Dragging a little kid
But in a park

She turns RIGHT and drives along the perimeter of the
parkstaring hard There’s a few KIDS playing too far
away to YELL to And no Frank No Driver

Another stop sign She looks LEFT

And youd want to keep heading away
from the highway

She pulls to that corner Looks LEFT--
Down the street is a PARKING GARAGE COMPLEX Multiple

Kate’s mouth goes DRY with anticipation She GUNS down the
street towards it

She pulls up to the PARKING GARAGE and then gets out of her
van leaving it parked horizontally out front so that it
blocks the entire ENTRANCEEXIT No one can get in or out

Kate runs inside past an incredulous TICKET BOOTH LADY

KATE (CONTD)
Did a man come through here with a

TICKET BOOTH LADY
You can’t leave your vehicle like

I’m gonna call security

Kate crosses the first level to the STAIRS which run up
along the outside corner of the parking garage UP THE

She peeks in as she comes to each floor Nothingnothing
out of the ordinary On the third floor she sees a DARK
FIGURE down the way opening his trunk Nope not him

She goes up another level and she’s on the roof Barely
any cars up here Could she be wrong

KATE
But

You can see for blocks from here Kate stands on the
corner and looks down scanning desperately She was
WRONG Then WHERE DID THEY GO

KATE (CONTD)
(insanely loud)
FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNEKK 1

Nothing The skyline doesn’t answer her Her confidence
is PLUMMETING She jogs across the roof diagonallymaybe
she can spot them from the opposite corner
BEEEQOOOOOWWW-BOOOOOOOP-WONK WONK WONK WONK WONK--
From BENEATH HER A CAR ALARM

KATE (CONTD)
FRAANKK

Kate SCREAMS his name as she RACES to the nearest
stairwell TRAMPLES down looks in on the third floor

The CAR ALARM cuts off She runs down another flight
SOME CARS on floor two too many to check individually

KATE (CONTD)
FRANK

She runs down another flight and finds herself stuck
outside now This staircase becomes external-only on the
ground level She’s stuck outside on the sidewalk

She hesitates for a split-second (go back up a flight and
then in Nah fuck it) then RUNS at top speed around the
outside of the building We can hear CARS moving inside
Kate comes around the corner Her MINIVAN is still where
she left it waaay down the sidewalk She slows down out
of breath Is she wrong Was it just somebody’s alarm
Then the Minivan BUMPS outward

Kates eyes widen She RUNS again The Minivan JOLTS
outward again and finally a BLACK VOLVO pushes through and
gets onto the street

KATE (CONTD)
FRAAAAAAAAAAANNNKKK

Kate JUMPS into the Minivan She SMASHES another VEHICLE
out of her way as she chases after the Volvo

Kate jumps into her Minivan and FLOORS IT She SMASHES
another VEHICLE out of her way as she chases after the
Volvo

KATE (CONTD)
I FOUND YOU

Her minivan SHOOTS down the street after them

KATE (CONTD)
I FOUND YOU YOU SON OF A BITCH

She SHOVES her horn down and flips on every switch she has-
Hazards Windshield wipers
Brights Washing fluid

The van looks CRAZY as it TEARS down the road after them
the horn WAILING washer fluid spitting off the sides

KATE (CONTD)
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHAAAAAA

Up ahead the Volvo FORCES ITSELF in-between STOPPED CARS
trying to SQUEEZE THROUGH TRAFFIC Its side view mirrors
CRUSH INWARD

Kate FOLLOWS RIGHT IN THEIR PATH METAL SQUEALS along the
sides of her Minivan as she PUSHES her way through the
stopped cars

OH MY GOD She can see FRANK in the back window pressing
his hands against the GLASS SCREAMING

The Volvo finds an OPENING and suddenly goes up onto the
SIDEWALK Kate follows after it barreling down the
sidewalkheaded towards a CROSSWALK crowded with
PEDESTRIANS

The Volvo CLIPS a PEDESTRIAN A GIRL She bounces into
the air like a rag doll and lands in the center of the
INTERSECTION clutching her leg in pain

Kate covers her mouth in horror The Volvo shoots across
the intersection without a shred of guilt

A TRUCK is coming from the left about to hit the Girl --
it screeches its brakes---

Kate has a split-second choice FRANK or the GIRL

Kate STOMPS her gas and YANKS her wheel LEFT VROOM---

She HITS the Truck square in its front right tire knocking
it OFF-COURSE at the last possible second The Truck
MISSES the Girl by mere FEET

A SEDAN SCREECHES and then HITS against Kate’s left side
Kate yanks her parking brake Other cars hit each other
piling up against the PROTECTIVE WALL Kate is forming with
her MINIVAN

Finally everything stops The injured Girl moans on the
ground She locks eyes with Kate -- they share a moment

Across the way the Volvo gets on an interstate onramp
The SEDAN MOTORIST curses Kate out through his windshield
Ignoring him Kate MANEUVERS out of this pileup revealing
the INJURED GIRL on the ground The Sedan Motorist kindly
shuts up

Kate’s Minivan is now in terrible condition severely
battle-damaged The gears are WRENCHING underneath her
carriage Why is she going so SLOW Is the Minivan too
damaged to drive now Oh NO What is she going to--

Oh Parking brake’s on -CLOP-

There we go She ZOOMS up the ramp

EXT INTERSTATE - CONTINUOUS

The highway goes over a giant LAKE in a MOUNTAINOUS RURAL
AREA

Kate hits the ground running 80 mph 90 mph WEAVING
through traffic WHOOSH Near-miss VRRROOOMMM

She SQUINTS to see driving directly towards the sunset
THERES THE VOLVO Up ahead She goes even FASTER

Up ahead an electronic readout sign BLINKS An AMBER
ALERT sign

Wait Kate squints
CHILD ABDUCTION
BROWN HATCHBACK
NO LICENSE PLATE

KATE
No NO you IDIOTS God DAMNIT

Kate SMACKS the wheel ENRAGED She’s right behind the
Volvo now Wait is this it She gets up alongside it --
it’s SOMEONE ELSE WRONG VOLVO

BING-BING-BING Huh Her GAS GAUGE red light comes on
it’s NEAR-EMPTY

N-no NO Concentrate Look for them look for them

Just then way up ahead a BLACK VOLVO SCREECHES across two
lanes to an EXIT LANE

THERE THEY ARE Kate makes a daring IMPRESSIVE maneuver
through traffic and gets over to the exit lane--

IE 2-LANE ROAD UP MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

Kate follows them off the exit onto a 2-lane road going up
into the woods She’s on his ASS They FLY past a BUG
FUMIGATION TRUCK with a big fiberglass INSECT straddling
the roof

Once they’re past him and ALONE the door of the Volvo
OPENS UP

He’s going to push Frank out all over again
Kate’s foot instinctively moves to the brake
Hesitates Looks at her gas gauge It’s BELOW EMPTY

If she lets them go this time that’s it It’1ll be over

KATE
No

She puts her foot back on the accelerator
That door is wide open THREATENING IT

KATE (CONTD)
No way

She keeps on the gas
FRANK’S HEAD leans out the door again

KATE (CONTD)
FUCK YOU

She STOMPS on the GAS Her minivan REVS up at them
She BUMPS into the back of the Volvo HARD

The door SLAMS SHUT The Volvo SKITTERS AROUND trying to
regain control

He opens the door again

KATE (CONTD)
rrrrrRRRREEEAAAAGGHH

She HITS THEM again The Volvo BOUNCES forward the door
flailing back and forth

KATE (CONTD)
DO ITI

She JERKS into the left lane and pulls up BESIDE THEM

KATE (CONTD)
(out her window)
Do it Try it you son of a bitch

The Driver looks over at her DUMBFOUNDED

KATE (CONTD)
You wanna play games

She GASSES it ahead and then gets in FRONT of them She
hits her BRAKE and the Volvo KUUNNK’s against the back of
the van

The Volvo slows down Kate DROPS BACK past them and gets
behind them again She PRESSES her bumper up against
theirs and PUSHES THEM

KATE (CONTD)
You understand

The door OPENS againcautiously

KATE (CONTD)
No

She pulls up NEXT to them again and moves her van over
pushing in on the door

KATE (CONTD)
I said NO

He keeps trying to open it as she swerves against it
Finally she pulls ahead She lines herself up with the
open door She hits the BRAKES

Her minivan SMACKS the door and it SLAMS SHUT

Kate falls back into position behind them She checks her
work The door is all CRUNCHED IN now It is never
opening again

The Volvo drives on at a stunned 45mph

Kate’s breathing is rapid-fire She gets ahold of herself
coming down from the rush She checks her speed

FFTTT-KA-FT-KA-KAAA-kaka Oh God

Her minivan’s engine is CROAKING underneath her She can
actually HEAR how little gasoline is left in it -- she can
hear it sloshing around as they head UPHILL

IE RURAL ROAD UP MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

The terrain is becoming HILLY The Volvo zooms up over a
little hill down the slope up over a little hill down
the slope The minivan is close behind

Kate checks the gauge again It hasn’t moved It can’t
move it is literally at rock bottom Fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck ---

More HILLS on the horizon as this two-car convoy goes down
the road

Kate SHOVES the gear shift into NEUTRAL She COASTS down a
slope At the bottom she SHOVES it into 2nd She PUSHES
up the hill

She looks ahead The Volvo is GAINING DISTANCE on her
fast She panics She continues the gear shifting

The Volvo coasts over a BIG hill and then drops out of her
sight SHE’S LOSING THEM

The Minivan comes over the same hill on its last legs
This hill is too STEEP The van is justbarely
makingitup

She’s near the crest when all the lights on the dashboard
LIGHT UP

The engine cuts off BING BING BING BING

KATE
No

Kate turns the steering wheel- it’s LOCKED UP

KATE (CONTD)
Pleeeeeeease

The Minivan slows to a complete STOP Then it begins to
SLIDE BACKWARD down the steep slope

Kate puts it in PARK The minivan grunts and finally
grinds to an oily whimpering HALT

EXT HILLY ROAD

Kate opens her door JUMPS OUT and chases the Volvo on
foot

The Volvo crests over one last hill in the distance and
then it’s out of sight

Kate keeps RUNNING in that direction out of sheer
stubbornness She gets to the bottom of a hill and starts
up the next incline Halfway up her legs start to give
way

The hopelessness of her efforts begins to dawn on her Her
legs cramp up and she falls to her knees

Near the top of the hill she can see the road ahead No
sign of the Volvo Of course there isn’t It’s long gone

She SCREAMS into the sky After all this time after all
she’s been through she’s LOST them RRRrrgh Kate
buries her head in the pavement refusing to accept it

Behind her coming over a hill PT-pT-PT-pptt-TT-ppt

The BUG FUMIGATION TRUCK they passed earlier Kate jumps
to her feet and WAVES HER ARMS

KATE
HELP HEEEELLLLLPP

The Bug Truck pulls up next to her Kate tries the door
KATE (CONTD)
(locked)

Lemme in

The concerned BUGMAN (overweight uniformed) unbuckles his
seatbelt reaches over and lets her in

BUGMAN
You alright

KATE
Do you have a phone

BUGMAN
(duhh )

Kate climbs in buckles her seat belt

KATE
Call 911

BUGMAN

KATE
(grabs the radio)
CALL 911
BUGMAN

(starts to turn
around)
KATE

What are you doing

BUGMAN
I don’t get reception on the
mountain We have to go down to
the lake to get a signal

KATE
(points up the road)
NO we have to go THAT way They
went THAT way

BUGMAN
That way’s a dead end though--

Kate looks out the windshield OH FUCK--

BASHH THE VOLVO SMASHES HEAD-ON INTO THEM The whole
world JOLTS BACKWARDS GLASS SPRAYS EVERYWHERE

IE HILLY ROAD - DUSK
Kate comes togets her bearings

The Bug Truck is WRECKED The BugMan is dead Kate stares
at him in macabre awe for a moment

Kate has a mean cut on her temple but she’s able to climb
out of her seat and up through the shattered windshield

KATE
Frank Franklin

She crawls across the hood of the Truck like Jackie Kennedy
and finally drops down on the passenger side of the Volvo
checking inside for Frank

KATE (CONTD)
Frank

He’s not inside But that’s impossiblewhere would he b-

The Driver suddenly climbs out the window on the other side
of the car He slings a SHOTGUN over the roof and aims at
Kate

ULP Kate ducks down and covers her head only a few feet
away from him She jerks around unpredictably waiting to
be dead any second

He FIRES Road asphalt peppers Kate’s face That means

HE MISSED RUN Kate INHALES SHARPLY She RUNSSTUMBLES
back towards her van FLIGHT MODE taking over all impulses

He opens his SHOTGUN RELOADING

Kate TRIPS on a HIGH HEEL and FALLS right in front of the
Minivan She hears the Shotgun COCK

EXPLODES behind her scattering TWISTED ALUMINUM around
her

She CRAWLS OUT from under the BACK of the van Reaches up
OPENS the Minivan’s rear LIFTGATE JUMPS INSIDE-

-and YANKS the liftgate SHUT
THROUGH WINDSHIELD The Driver HOBBLES towards the van

Kate THROWS HERSELF forwards over the seatsREACHES OUT--

HANDLE

Kate ducks down under the middle seat GRINDING HER TEETH
in TERROR

DRIVER (OS)

He checks the road ADRENALIZED Kate doesn’t move

The Driver comes around to the SLIDING SIDE-DOOR of the Van
and then goes out of her range of sight

What can she dowhat can she do She looks aroundsees
her keys in the ignition

The gear shift in PARKhmmm

BLAST

The SLIDING DOOR WINDOW BUCKLES INWARD turning into a
KALEIDOSCOPIC SPIDER WEB of tiny bits of glass held
together by a thin layer of film

Kate can see the Driver coming toward the van in the SIDE
VIEW MIRROR

Gotta act fast She STRETCHES her arm across the door and
GRIPS the HANDLE

The Driver REACHES HIS ARM through the hole in the window
trying for the handle

Kate YANKS the sliding door OPEN which TRAPS the Drivers
ARM between the door and its frame CRUNCH

DRIVER (CONTD)
ARRRRGGGHH

He sticks the SHOTGUN into the van and fires blind BLAST

LITTLE PIECES OF FOAM explode out of the middle seat
cushion floating down like snow

Kate grabs the barrel of the shotgun and leverages it
against the door until she is able to JERK the gun into the
Van The Driver CLIMBS halfway into the Van and GRABS it
trying to WRESTLE it back

Kate SCREAMS KICKING The Driver stronger PULLS THE GUN
OUT OF KATE’S HANDS

Shit Kate lunges forward grabs the DOOR HANDLE

and SLIDES THE DOOR INTO the Driver with all her
strength The Door CRUSHES into the Drivers RIBS

Kate grabs the gear shift and SHIFTS the Van into NEUTRAL
EXT VAN - CONTINUOUS

The Minivan begins to ROLL BACKWARDS down the hill The
Driver is pinned in the sliding door so that his waist and
legs are hanging out the side of the van as it rolls

INT VAN - CONTINUOUS

The Driver GRABS at her Kate unbuckles Frank’s CAR SEAT
raises it over her head and SLAMS it down on the Driver

BATTERING him with it Keeping him at bay

The Van is ROLLING FAST now It rolls off the road onto
the grass headed towards the trees

The passenger-side of the Minivan scrapes up against a
THICK OAK TREE and the Minivan abruptly STOPS as the
oak tree CRUNCHES against the sliding door CRRUUNNNCHH

Inside the van the Driver’s upper body suddenly goes LIMP
His arms drop to the floor His head hangs

Kate raises the Car Seat over her head again preparing to
attack and then hesitates

The Driver is not moving Silent
A piece of bark falls in through the window onto the floor

of the van Kate realizes that the tree CRUSHED the
Driver’s legs and waist He is PARALYZED

He’s still breathing Labored wheezy breathing

KATE
Where’s my son
(beat)
Where is he

She lifts the Driver’s head to interrogate him but quickly
realizes it is futile Though conscious and still
breathing the Driver cannot speak Every muscle is
paralyzed His facial expression is horrifically frozen

She lets go of his hair and his head slumps down again
Kate thinks She looks up at that tree
EXT MINIVAN - DUSK

Kate comes around to the TREE-SIDE of the Minivan -- UGH
The Driver’s WAIST and LEGS are mangled crushed between
the Van and the THICK OAK TREE His feet stick out
awkwardly at her

Yuuuckk she moves one of the legs over UUGGHH
She turns her head away as she reaches into the tangled
mess of limbs digs into the Driver’s pants pocket

-and pulls out the Driver’s WALLET
INT MINIVAN - DUSK
Kate crawls in Sets his wallet open on the dashboard

suddenly becomes LOUDER FASTER

Kate types the address into her GPS screen “SEARCHING”

KATE (CONTD)

The mute Driver is visibly TERRIFIED He WHEEZES loud in
panic Then the breath stops altogether His eyes FREEZE

He’s DEAD

Okay Okay Kate looks around for shells Picks one up
off the floor -- SPENT

She looks down the EMPTY BARREL of her shotgun Without
ammo it’s useless She can’t go up there with this

She hits her GPS screen “POLICE” The GPS map zooms out
God the closest police station is waaaay back at that town
she just came from

She looks down the road the way she came Should she go
get the police Risk the chance that the Woman might kill
Frank in the meantime

She looks back up the road That Volvo’s engine is still
running Deep breath

She leaves the engine running and gets out Just stares at
the mailbox for a moment -- so surreal She picks up her
empty shotgun Ready CLOSES IT UP Here goes

the porch A screen door in front She can see inside
into a kitchen where there is a wall-mounted PORTABLE

It’s just one room a GARAGETOOL SHEDSTORAGE-kind of
place In the center of the room a CYLINDER-SHAPED
ALUMINUM PIPE comes up from a wood-burning stove and goes

straight up into a hole in the ceiling

An old ZENITH TV is on -- that was the “talking” Some old

A CIRCULAR HOLE is cut in the ceiling for the pipe to run
up into The hole’s a little bit bigger than the pipe
leaving a thin sliver of OPEN SPACE around the pipe
Frank APPEARS in that sliver of space

KATE
Oh Franklin

His little fingers reach down and she squeezes his hand

Frank disappears from the hole Then his little SHOES poke
out of the hole

Kate tucks her knife into the back of her pants and PUSHES
the ALUMINUM PIPE with all her strength trying to create
more space for him to slip down through The Pipe is
pretty lightweight but it’s not BENDING Frank gets his
LEGS through

FRANK

STOMACH pinned between the pipe and the edge of the
ceiling

KATE

FrankOh God please
She hates to do this to him
She puts her foot on the PIPE and PUSHES against

between the pipe and the edge of the hole NO GOOD
Kate grabs a SHOVEL that’s leaning against the wall and
starts SMACKING the PADLOCK on the attic entrance It’s no

Then she hears it outside a TRUCK ENGINE
THE WOMAN IS COMING BACK

Frank HUGS HER NECK SCREAMING

The DOOR OPENS behind her Kate spins around with Frank to
see the WOMAN IN THE DOORWAY WITH THE SHOTGUN

The Womans tear-streaked face goes from AGONY to SHOCK as
the TWO WOMEN stare at each other for one long second

KATE (CONTD)
The cops are coming-

The Woman PULLS THE TRIGGER
—-KLIK-

EMPTY Kate QUICK-DRAWS the KNIFE out of her waistband and
holds it out threateningly at the Woman

The Woman stares down the barrel at Kate Incredulous

KATE (CONTD)
Everyone stay up there Don’t come
down no matter what The police
are coming
(to Woman)
Now turn around bitch

The Woman has clearly been crying her eyes red She just
found her husband’s body And now she takes Kate in --
shirt covered in blood knife in hand The Woman begins to
SHAKE with RAGE

KATE (CONTD)
Turn around

The WOMAN grabs her shotgun by the barrel and BASHES Kate
with it FURIOUS Kate drops Frank and throws her arms up
in defense

FRANK
Mommy

The Woman grabs Kate and HURLS her into a workbench
sending NAILS everywhere on the floor ABOVE the children
SCREAM

The Woman GRABS Kate’s arm and TWISTS it forcing the knife
out of her hands

Kate grabs a handful of nails and JABS them into the
Woman’s shoulder repeatedly Kate is able to wriggle her
arm free The Woman stumbles over some of the collapsed
pipe Trips

Kate SCOOPS up Frank and HAULS ASS out of there

EXT YARD - NIGHT

POV Kate RUNS AT TOP SPEED for the PICKUP TRUCK parked in
the middle of the yard A MOTION DETECTOR LIGHT comes on
and BATHES HER in WHITE LIGHT

She gets to the Truck Hurries Frank inside She JUMPS
in Reaches for the ignition

The KEYS aren’t in the ignition Checks the sun visor

KATE
She has the keys

Kate looks back at the Cabin The Woman COMES OUT
Carrying the SHOTGUN She closes the Cabin door

-and then that TIMED MOTION DETECTOR LIGHT clicks off
Everything goes back to BLACK Kate can’t see ANYTHING

She hits the DOOR LOCK button Frank is whimpering

KATE (CONTD)
SHHH

Silence Just Kate’s BREATHING Listening for footsteps
in the grass Should they get out and run To where

Suddenly the MOTION DETECTOR LIGHT nearest to the Truck
flicks ON Looks out her window

The big white circle of light reveals nothing -- no sign of
the Woman But she must have just been there Kate looks
around the Truck she could be right next to them

Kate BREATHES faster and faster

Behind her at the house the SCREEN DOOR SLAMS The Woman
went inside

FRANK
Mommy
KATE
Shhh
(thinks)
The Volvo

Kate assesses the situation They could run down the
driveway right now jump in that Volvo get the hell out of
here

But those kids she can’t leave those kids
KATE (CONTD)

(nods )
Okay Frank we have to go back

FRANK
No No Mommy let’s go I wanna
go
KATE
(whispers )

SHH Do what I say Come on

She PICKS Frank up out of his seat She gets out of the
Truck and RUNS across the yard towards the CABIN

Frank sees where they’re heading

FRANK
Noooo

SHIT Kate COVERS HIS MOUTH Keeps running

Frank jerks his head free and YELLS again He’s FREAKING
OUT so much that she nearly drops him

FRANK (CONTD)
I don’t wanna go in there NOOO
Mommy nooo

She STOPS in the middle of the grass and COVERS his mouth

KATE
SHH SHHH

Wait as soon as there’s silence again she hears

BARK BARK BARK
The DOG The Woman is getting the DOG

Kate gathers Frank into her arms She runs him back to the
Cabin

It’s LOCKED They can’t go inside

KATE (CONTD)
Oh Godwe have to hide

Where The WOODS The Dog BARKS just as she looks at
the trees No good It’1l hunt them down easily

From inside the house Kate hears the Dog and the Woman
BOUNDING down the staircase She has SECONDS to hide

Kate looks over at the covered SWIMMING POOL
INT COVERED SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

Kate crawls underneath the perimeter lining and lowers
herself into the icy water clutching Frank against her
chest

She reaches up and tucks the pool cover back in over her
head just as we hear the House’s SCREEN DOOR OPEN The
Woman and her Dog are outside

We hear them walkingthen a GUNSHOT GLASS SHATTERS
A moment later we hear the Truck door open

WOMAN (OS)
Where’d they go Huh Where’d
they go

Kate hears the dog approaching Then it sniffs above her
It POKES ITS NOSE down into the cover dipping the cover
down on top of them a bit Then it BARKS

Oh no oh no oh no BARK BARK BARK BARK

The POOL LIGHT comes on underneath them The pool is
instantly ILLUMINATED casting a womb-like light off of the
faded pink tiles Trash and dead leaves float around
everywhere

The Dog’s SNARLING JAW digs in through the cover BITING AT
THEM Kate clutches Frank and they SUBMERGE swimming
away

When they come up for air Kate’s head PUSHES UP the sunken-
in pool cover

EXT SWIMMING POOL

FROM THE SURFACE we can see the shape of Kate’s head come
up underneath the pool cover The Woman COCKS the shotgun--

INT SWIMMING POOL

GUNSHOT A HOLE RIPS through the cover right beside
Kate’s SHOULDER JESUS

Kate takes Frank back underwater What can they do She
keeps them under as long as she can out of air

She raises her chin and pops up just enough to get air
then immediately SUBMERGES again

A second later BUCKSHOT tears through the cover right
where her head just was

Kate swims with Frank over to the SIDE of the pool They
emerge in an air pocket against the pool wall

Suddenly a SPLASH The DOG slips through the cover and
jumps into the pool He’s swimming towards them BARKING
ferociously

Kate puts Frank’s hands on the RIM so he can hold himself
above water and then she turns to face the Dog--

KATE
Huhhhuhhhh

The Dog CLAWS at her RABID She tries to SHOVE him away

Frank holds onto the side SCREAMING Suddenly the ENTIRE
COVER ABOVE THEM BEGINS TO MOVE

EXT SWIMMING POOL

The Woman is pulling the cover off of the pool Every
second that passes Kate and Frank have less and less
covered area to hide underneath In no time they’1ll be
SITTING DUCKS

INT SWIMMING POOL

Kate STRUGGLES with the Dog Frank tries to move further
along the wall as the EDGE OF THE COVER approaches him

Some cover sinks down between Kate and the Dog The Dog
PAWS at her through the cover RIPPING it to BITE at her
She wrestles with the Dog until he gets hopelessly TANGLED
UP in it BLIND Taking his focus off of her

KATE
(turns )
FRANK

Kate pushes BUNCHED-UP COVER aside and finally sees Frank
clutching onto the SIDE LADDER in the deep end CRYING
She swims to his side and HUGS HIM

The Woman has almost pulled the cover completely off Kate
and Frank crowd together under the last remaining corner

FRANK
MOMMMMYYY MOMMMMYYY

Through the cover Kate sees the shape of the Woman’s FOOT
at the edge of the pool

Kate hooks her own leg around the LADDER for leverage She
reaches up GRABS the cover above her head with both
hands

and YANKS it with ALL HER MIGHT The Woman SLIPS
thrown off-balance and FALLS INTO THE POOL

IE SWIMMING POOL

Kate pushes the cover off of her and EMERGES The Woman
is STRUGGLING to get her bearings surrounded by ripped-up
half-floating half-sinking POOL COVER

She starts splashing around looking for something
-the SHOTGUN

Kate starts looking as well but both women have a
difficult time trying to maneuver around in the pool now
atop all of this bunched-up plastic They move clumsily
off-balance sinking

The soggy DOG climbs out of the pool and SHAKES OFF
whimpering Frank clutches onto the ladder CRYING

The Woman FINDS THE SHOTGUN on top of a floating portion of
cover Kate gulps She grabs the pool cover and YANKS THE
WOMAN TOWARDS HER

The Woman whips around as she floats rapidly towards
Kateaims the shotgun

Kate SLAPS it down The Shotgun BLASTS into the pool
sending a SPRAY of WATER six feet high Frank SCREAMS

The Woman lets go of the gun and ATTACKS KATE trying to
push her underwater and DROWN her Kate holds her own
almost unnaturally CALM FOCUSED METHODICAL

The Dog BARKS from the sidelines as they STRUGGLE

Kate gets TANGLED UP in the cover The Woman rolls her up
in it and then pushes Kate UNDERWATER HOLDS HER DOWN
Kate is too tangled to swim or even move

Kate PANICS then quickly focuses again Stay calm Stick
your hands out touch the cover feel for a FOLDTHERE
Now spread the fold openkeep digging through it

Kate finally gets FREE into open water again She swims to
the surface for air GASP

FRANK
Mommy Look out

The Woman GRABS KATE in a HEADLOCK The Woman takes a deep
breath of air then SUBMERGES

She uses her heavy weight to DRAG Kate downward At the
bottom of the deep end there’s a bunch of STORM DEBRIS
(crate lids branches etc) Kate tries to get free--

The Woman puts her feet on some debris for leverage then
presses her back and shoulders into Kate’s chest pinning
Kate against the wall

WHOA Kate is STUCK The Woman PUSHES with her feet
forcing her shoulder deeper into Kate’s chest Kate
struggles not to lose her breath

Kate reaches around the Woman’s neck -- tries for a
headlock The hefty Woman easily pulls Kate’s arm away and
then protects her own neck to keep Kate from trying again
She’s holding her breath Waiting Kate out

Kate’s arms limply hug around the Woman’s stomach Losing
consciousness Kate looks up and sees Frank’s legs
dangling by the ladder

She gets an idea

Kate feels around on the Woman’s stomach She finds the
base of the Woman’s ribcage She clasps her hands together
on the Woman’s abdomen

And then Kate gives the Woman the HEIMLICH MANEUVER

AIR EXPLODES out of the Woman’s mouth A moment of PURE
SHOCK-

--and then just as abruptly WATER RUSHES IN TO FILL THE
VACUUM

The Woman STRUGGLES KICKS SWIMS FIGHTS DESPERATELY FOR
HER LIFE but Kate keep her arms locked around her holding
her down there

Finally Kate gets unpinned and swims for the surface
leaving the Woman floating lifelessly in the EERIE POOL
LIGHT Dreamlike

EXT SWIMMING POOL

Kate SURFACES BREATHES Huhhuh

She’s trapped under a ton of pool cover Throws it off of
her trying to dig her way out of it

She finally gets into open air The Woman’s body floats to
the surface DEAD

A SPLASH Kate GASPS-- It was just the Dog
jumping back into the pool It swims over to the Woman’s
body whimpering harmlessly

Kate turns to Frank Wait Frank’s not at the ladder--

KATE
Frank FRANK

Oh God -- there’s torn-up pool cover spread all over the
pool Could he be stuck underneath it somewhere She
lifts it up searching frantically --

FRANK
Mommy are you okay

She spins around Frank is out of the pool

KATE
FRANKLIN

She swims towards him The little tyke struggles to pick
up a long POOL HOOK and hold it out to her trying to help
bring his Mommy into shore

FRANK
Grab it Mommy 1I’11 pull you in

As she watches her four-year-old try and lug this heavy
pole the ADRENALINE begins to drain out of Kate’s eyes

She rests a hand on it and swims herself along to make him
think he’s really pulling her in

When she gets to the edge Frank drops the pole rushes
over and “helps” her get up onto the concrete

She EMBRACES him

KATE
Let me see you honey Are you
okay

Kate yanks a dirty towel off a nearby chair wrapping Frank
up like a baby rubbing him to keep him warm

FRANK
I didn’t run away Mom

KATE
What

FRANK
(he sniffles and
snorts through it)
I just wanted to watch the acorn
part and then I was going to come
back before you got out of the
dressing room

Kate’s eyes tear up
SHE HUGS FRANK INTO HER ARMS AS TIGHT AS SHE CAN

KATE
Shhh I know baby I know It’s
okay

The Dog suddenly climbs out of the pool and races down the
driveway BARKING

Kate looks up to see a pair of HEADLIGHTS coming into the
yard

KATE (CONTD)
The police are here Frank We’re
okay

Wait it’s not a cavalry of police cars It’s a LONE
BLACK VAN

The Black Van comes to a stop in the yard The headlights
aimed right in Kate’s eyes

The doors open up and TWO MEN get out Kate squints to see
them Both dressed in black One holding a briefcase

Kate hugs Frank tight against her chest No not now Not
after all this She prepares for the worst

But the Men seem as confused as Kate is The Dog starts
barking again

WE HEAR SIRENS APPROACHING

The Men suddenly get back into their van quickly They
throw it in reverse and try to pull out

They are ILLUMINATED FROM ABOVE in a WHITE SPOTLIGHT

WHUP-WHUP-WHUP-WHUP-WHUP Kate looks up and sees a
HELICOPTER shining a light down into the yard

The CALVARY arrives POLICE CARS vrooom up to the house
surrounding the Black Van

KATE (CONTD)
(almost a question)
We’re okay

COPS get out guns drawn The Men get out of their van
hands up in surrender

OFFICER 2

KATE (CONTD)

INT POLICE ON THE SCENE IN THE YARD - NIGHT

COP (OS)

Kate TALKS to her HUSBAND on an OFFICER’S phone She
alternates between SOBBING and ECSTATIC GIGGLING We can
barely make out most of the words she’s saying but the
feeling behind them is APPARENT

KATE

INT BACK OF AMBULANCE - NIGHT

Frank looks up at his Mom while a PARAMEDIC puts a plastic
AIR MASK over his mouth He’s laying in a gurney

KATE
Don’t worry honey it’s just air
You can relax You can even fall
asleep if you want

FRANK
Are you gonna stay right there

KATE
Mm-hmm Mommy’1l be right here

Kate looks over at the Cabin FRIENDLY PARAMEDICS are
carrying the TWO OTHER CHILDREN out The kids are skinny
and dirty but they seem to be okay

One KID with his head on a paramedic’s shoulder MEETS EYES
with Kate Kate recognizes him from one of the flyers she
saw at the Police Station

The kid seems scared so Kate smiles at him He stares at
her awkwardly then grins back

She gets a lump in the throat Each of those kids is Frank
to some other mother

PARAMEDIC
(to the driver)
Let’s go

A Paramedic closes the back doors and the Ambulance pulls
off down the road

Kate pets Frank’s head singing him a LULLABY neither of
them breaking eye contact Frank’s eyes get heavy and he
finally snuggles up a little and closes his eyes
She leans down and kisses his forehead
KATE
(whispers in his ear)
I love you Frank

He mumbles something UNINTELLIGIBLE in his air mask

KATE (CONTD)
What

She lifts it off his face just a tad
FRANK
(half-asleep)
Happy Mother’s Day Mommy

Kate puts the mask back down and sits up She looks over
her son’s body He’s okay From his head right down to
his
Kate gulps back tears
The DOUBLE KNOTS are still there Still tied tight
Kate smiles so hard she’s shaking
EXT HIGHWAY - DAWN
