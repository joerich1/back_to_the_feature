INT EMPIRE ROOM BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY (LATE 1980S)
TWO BESPECTACLED EYES Blinking Alert Male Middle-aged
Reflected in his shiny GLASSES - a WOMAN middle-aged (JANE
HAWKING) removing the glasses from his nose

CUT TO
The MANs POV as -

- his vision goes from FOCUSED to BLURRY as the GLASSES are
removed

- his BLURRY POV of the WOMANs hands POLISHING his glasses
with a cloth

- his BLURRY POV then shifts (as she steps aside) onto a
SMALL PERSON in the distance jumping up and down

- his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his
nose and -

- with this his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS and the
SMALL PERSON is revealed to be -- a BOY playing
HOPSCOTCH in the RED-CARPETED CORRIDOR

- Beyond the BOY TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin
(unceremoniously) to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony They
lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes One blows his
nose

TIGHT ON The eyes behind the glasses watching his eyes
finally looking downwardas we hear a metallic CLICKING
sound - CLICK CLICK CLICK

- ANGLE ON HIS HAND which is clicking a CLICKER-PLATE

- then on a COMPUTER MONITOR (mounted to the CHAIR) words
form out of a streaming alphabet with each CLICK The man
is at work selecting LETTERS then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU
-making sentences by these means

- OTHER PARTIAL VIEWS (ECUs) of this MAN in his WHEELCHAIR
We seea TUFT of BROWN HAIRhis HAND on chair arm-rest
his FEET on a wheelchairs foot-restsJANEs HANDS
arrange the BROWN HAIRadjust his THIN ARMSbut never do
we see the full man as -

- the TWO EQUERRIES open TWO LARGE ORNATE DOORS and motion
the PARTY forward

MATCH CUT TO

EXT CAMBRIDGE STREETS - DAY (EARLY-MID 1960s)

the FRONT WHEEL of STEPHENs BICYCLE SPINNING VERY VERY
FAST

STEPHEN HAWKING (in his early 20s) and his friend BRIAN
(same age) race each other recklessly through the NARROW
WINDING LANES It looks VERY DANGEROUS They are neck and
neck And they are loving it

STEPHEN HAWKING his face almost entirely covered with
spectacles and floppy hair slight of frame a velvet jacket
and velvet bow tie eccentric-looking STEPHEN is a fun-
loving playful active young student

BRIAN STEPHENs best friend More interested in life than
studies as we shall see

EXT STUDENT PARTYCAMBRIDGE - DUSK

STEPHEN and BRIAN arrive at the party dismount at speed and
running to a walk crash their BIKES into a HEDGE BRIAN wins
the race raises arms aloft as - they enter the PARTY We
follow them in(CONTINUOUS SHOT)

INT STUDENT PARTYCAMBRIDGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

STEPHEN and BRIAN enter and the CAMERA finally follows
them into the main room of the PARTY

STEPHEN and BRIAN come to a halt in the doorway as they
observe -

- a CROWDED ROOM engaged in lively bubbly conversation In
the background suitably elegant music plays

BRIAN
First to find a drink

STEPHEN and BRIAN make their way through the GUESTS looking
for the BAR BRIAN eyes the PRETTY GIRLS he passes

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Im sure the secret of the universe
has something to do with sex There
you go--why dont you do your
doctorate on that The physics of
love

STEPHEN
More your field I think

BRIAN
Youd better decide on your
subject Im serious--they1l boot
you out

They reach the PUNCH-BOWL BRIAN tastes the PUNCH with his
finger and UNIMPRESSED fills TWO GLASSES

CUT TO

A YOUNG WOMAN JANE WILDE arrives at the door with her
friend DIANA DIANA is unimpressed by the party

JANE shy has her hair up in a fashionable bouffant roll
DIANA is more vivacious and touches up her lipstick

DIANA

Scientists Dont worry We dont
have to stay long Looks
mortifyingly dull

(seeing a boy)
Oh hang on--

(waves to the boy)
Be right back okay Okay

JANE nods as DIANA goes over to GREET the boy and then walk
off together with him into the crowd

ANGLE ON JANE marooned
CUT TO

At the PUNCH-BOWL drinking punch

STEPHEN

I applied for a job
BRIAN

Did you
STEPHEN

Civil Service

BRIAN
Well its a back-up plan--in your
case not a bad idea Did they
accept you

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

ANGLE ON STEPHENs POV of JANE standing across the room
now holding a WINE-GLASS

STEPHEN
Unfortunately that Ill never
know Morning of their exam
I (smiles)

BRIAN
- slept in Well thank Christ
the world has lost a promising pay-
clerk

BRIAN holds out a FULL PUNCH GLASS for STEPHEN but STEPHEN
still has his eye on JANE BRIAN follows STEPHENs GAZE as -

- STEPHEN and JANEs eyes meet They hold this look until
she shyly looks away

BRIAN has observed this exchange

BRIAN (CONT’D)
(LATIN)
Quo est femella

STEPHEN
I was going to ask you

BRIAN
Actually--I think shes--yes--
Basils sister Wilde--Jane Wilde
(Russian accent)
So You like for me I introduce”

STEPHEN contemplates this as we -

CUT TO

DIANA changes the RECORD - to BOP JAZZ GUESTS immediately
take the DANCE-FLOOR and start DANCING

DIANA returns to JANE

DIANA
Thats better

JANE
Who is that guy

DIANA
(looking at Stephen)
Oh Hes strange clever goes on
Ban The Bomb marches
(spying another boy)
Oh theres David Come on

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

DIANA goes over to DAVID but JANE stays where she is
CUT TO
BRIAN walks off to talk to another GIRL while -

- STEPHEN left alone decides to slowly approach JANE JANE
has hardly touched her wine STEPHEN has a beer

They look around the room together and then -

STEPHEN
Hello

JANE
Hello

STEPHEN
Science

JANE
Arts

More silence They look elsewhere

JANE (CONTD)
So what do you-

STEPHEN
Cosmologist Im a cosmologist

JANE
Whats a cosmologist

STEPHEN
Its a kind of religion--for
intelligent atheists
(suspiciously)
Youre not religious are you

JANE
C of E Church of England

STEPHEN
(simultaneously)
- England
(smiles cheekily)
I suppose someone has to be

JANE is not sure whether to take offence
JANE

So--what do cosmologists worship
then

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

STEPHEN
(grins)
A single unifying equation that
explains everything in the
universe

JANE
(amused)
Really So whats the equation

STEPHEN smiles

STEPHEN
That is the question

CUT TO

The NEEDLE on the RECORD PLAYER now drops onto a ROLLING
STONES record - TIME IS ON OUR SIDE

Few people remain at the party now The tables are empty -
the food is gone The punch bowl is drained dry

DIANA is still talking to DAVID laughing
ANGLE ON JANE now listening intently to STEPHEN

JANE
Why didnt you stay at Oxford

STEPHEN
My finals papers were such a
shambles the examiners called me in
for a Viva and I told them -

JANE
Whats a viva

STEPHEN
A mildly terrifying face-to-face
thingy An interrogation
So I told them that if they gave me
a 2nd class degree Id stay with
them and do my research at Oxford
but if they gave me the lst I
needed to get into Cambridge then
theyd never have to see me again

JANE
They gave you the lst

STEPHEN
They gave me the lst

JANE laughs STEPHEN grins - its a GREAT GRIN as -

- DIANA approaches

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

DIANA
This party is officially deceased
Come on--Ive fixed you up a ride
home

DAVID and DAVIDs HANDSOME FRIEND wait by the door JANE
barely has time to speak before she is dragged away by DIANA

JANE
Well I hope you find your
equation

STEPHEN stands there forlorn But then JANE returns stuffs
something in his hand and then runs away

Its a NAPKIN On it - a PHONE NUMBER He stares at it
delighted so much so that he taps one foot

INT SEMINAR ROOMTRINITY HALLCAMBRIDGE - DAY

STEPHEN reads a CHESS BOOK that lies on his LAP out of sight
under the table while the professor DR DENNIS SCIAMA
(LATE 30s) with a wicked smirk on his face passes out a set
of mathematical problems to BRIAN CARTER ELLIS REES and
several other YOUNG PHYSICISTS

SCIAMA
A little challenge for you all as
you embark on your separate
doctoral journeys -
(handing paper to STEPHEN)
- whatever they may be Mr Hawking -

STEPHEN looks up winces knowing hes way behind schedule

SCIAMA (CONT’D)
Something to sort--the men from the
boys--the wheat from the chaff--
the mesons from the pi-mesons--the
quarks from the quacks--ten
questions--each more impregnable
than the last Good luck Youll
need it Shall we say Friday 3
oclock

BRIAN
(aside gloomyto STEPHEN)
This is going to hospitalize me
STEPHEN crumples the paper in his pocket and continues to
read the CHESS BOOK as he shuffles out of the tutorial
EXT QUAD TRINITY HALL CAMBRIDGE UNI - DAY

BRIAN runs across the QUAD
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

INT STEPHENS ROOMDORM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY BRIAN knocks enters finds STEPHEN asleep in bed

BRIAN
Oh come on get up How many have
you got

BRIAN goes to STEPHENs desk looking through papers to find
his answers How many have you done

STEPHEN
Morning Brian

BRIAN
Afternoon Stephen Where are they
Where are you hiding them Your
answers

STEPHEN
Brian I have no idea what youre
talking about

BRIAN
How many of Sciamas questions have
you done

STEPHEN
None
BRIAN
You liar
STEPHEN
I was going do them later
BRIAN
Later You mean you havent even

started
Beat

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Stephen are you aware you have
voluntarily embarked on a PHD in
physics at one of the most
prestigious colleges in England

STEPHEN
Yes

BRIAN
Oh good Thought maybe youd slept
through the induction or something

BRIAN starts to leave

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

STEPHEN
(to Brian at the door)
Bri-
BRIAN
What
STEPHEN

Can you whip on some Wagner

BRIAN
Sod off

BRIAN exits giving up on his pal STEPHEN hung-over sits
on his bed and yawns

He gets out of bed and turns on his ANCIENT TAPE-MACHINE
WAGNER starts to play loudly

Later Pouring milk into a cup of TEA while listening to a
TAPED RECORDING of THE RING CYCLE by Wagner and still in
his pyjamas the dishevelled STEPHEN digs out the QUESTIONS
from a pile of TRASH on his desk First he finds all manner
of chocolate wrappers concert tickets etc until he finally
settles down with a clean pad and a pencil He looks at the
clock It reads -- 100PM He sighs and looks out his window
at teeming university life as he ponders

He then starts to WRITE on a PAD rapidly effortlessly the
CALCULATIONS pouring out of him his writing hand adroit and
swift

Distracted he then reaches for his TEA and clumsily KNOCKS
THE CUP OVER The tea washes over his only pad

He hurriedly wipes it off but it’s too late He looks around
for another pad but to no avail

INT SEMINAR ROOM TRINITY COLLEGE - DAY

The PhD STUDENTS are gathered minus STEPHEN as SCIAMA hands
back the classes answers

SCIAMA
(passing paper)
John this so illegible Im not
quite sure how wrong it is--I
suspect very--and Brian
(tossing papers)
thats just--baffling

STEPHEN arrives late -

SCIAMA (CONTD)
Stephen glad you could join us

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

STEPHEN
Sorry

STEPHEN sets TWO TRAIN TIMETABLES on the table Others push
the TIME-TABLES down the desk to SCIAMA who picks them up

SCIAMA
Train timetables
Stephen these are totally
unacceptable--they expired a month
ago

Laughter

STEPHEN
Sorry Its on the back Had a
little accident

SCIAMA turns them over and looks at them

TIGHT ON the TIMETABLES then are filled with tiny formulas
and calculations

SCIAMA registers growing amazement then looks up at STEPHEN -

STEPHEN (CONTD)
I could only do nine

End on SCIAMA and fellow students reaction - startled
speechless everyone staring at STEPHEN

SCIAMA
WellI seewell thank God Well
done Stephen

BRIAN
silently mouths )
Nine

unfolds The TWO CREWS are from the same CLUB

PAN DOWN one BOAT EIGHT LARGE POWERFUL ROWERS culminating
in PETE DAN RAFF BRIAN and finally the thin boyish

Playing PINBALL are BRIAN REES ELLIS and CARTER STEPHEN
watches drinking a beer distracted

CARTER
No no listen listen pay
attention A man enters a lift
wanting to go to the fiftieth
floor but only gets as far as the
46th Why

BRIAN
(exhausted)
Erm - there was a naked girl in
the lift

Collective groan BRIAN is clipped around the ears

BRIAN (CONTD)
Hey--its the closest Ill get to
a unifying theory leave me
alone

ALL then silently ponder the RIDDLE BRIAN deep in thought
himself finally notices STEPHEN bursting to provide the
answer BRIAN acts to SILENCE STEPHEN —

BRIAN (CONTD)
(raising a finger)
Uh

ELLIS
No--we give up No idea

STEPHEN
He was too short to reach the
button for the fiftieth floor
STEPHEN rises triumphant as the others groan
BRIAN

Okay Ive got one Okay okay--
A naked girl enters a lift -

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

STEPHEN at the bar opens JANEs NAPKIN Looks at the
number

STEPHEN
(to BARMAN)
Do you have change for the pay-
phone

BARMAN
Sure

The BARMAN takes STEPHENs POUND and glances at the NAPKIN

BARMAN (CONTD)
Id commit that number to memory if
I were you

STEPHEN smiles - then glances at the mirror-backed bar
Reflected - a WOMAN who looks like JANE Is he imagining
this

TIGHT ON STEPHENs face we see JANEs reflection appear and
disappear in the glass of his glasses as she crosses the
room

The BARMANs voice is distant

BARMAN (CONTD)
Here you go

STEPHEN snaps out of it - stares at the BARMAN holding out
CHANGE - a smile DAWNING

BARMAN (CONTD)
Sir Are you okay

STEPHEN
Uh - my napkin just walked in

CUT TO
JANE and DIANA and two other FRIENDS sit with TWO OTHER YOUNG
MEN at a table She looks reluctant and unhappy to be with
them As one YOUNG MAN pours them beers she hands her beer to
someone else And then -

STEPHEN (CONTD)
Hi
STEPHEN is not afraid to stand in front of this crowd of
Girls and Jocks and stare straight at JANE The others fall
silent and stare at STEPHEN but JANEs eyes light up

JANE
Hello

REACTION DIANA Not impressed

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

STEPHEN
Whats the probability

JANE
Reasonably low
(to others)

Uh - this is - Stephen

He smiles at her The OTHERS look back and forth between JANE
and STEPHEN JANE perks up interested

STEPHEN
Croquet Do you play croquet
JANE
(interested)

Um Not recently

STEPHEN
Sunday morning

JANE
Im actually busy Sunday mornings

STEPHEN
Oh Of course
(pointing heaven-ward)

STEPHEN turns and just walks away JANE is perplexed
disappointed - stares at him as do the others

and knocks -

INT SCIAMAS OFFICEDEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND
THEORETICAL PHYSICS (DAMTP) CAMBRIDGE - DAY

SCIAMA
Stephen come in Sit down Now--
were all rather concerned--about
your choice of subject What its
going to be

STEPHEN
I cant decide

SCIAMA
Any ideas

One of SCIAMAs PENS sits precariously on the edge of the
desk and in shuffling papers knocks it off

( )

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

The PEN rolls off the DESK and falls on the FLOOR in front of
STEPHEN STEPHEN stares at the PEN as it comes to a STOP

STEPHEN
Umm--— No

SCIAMA studies him rises take a BIG OLD KEY from the desk
drawer

SCIAMA
Come with me

INT CAVENDISH LAB CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY
SCIAMA shows STEPHEN the famous lab

SCIAMA
This lab is where JJ Thomson
discovered the electron where
Rutherford split the atom One of
the great rewards of this job is
that you never know from where the
next great leap forward is going to
come or from whom

SCIAMA takes out a pen and writes on a pad tears it off and
gives it to STEPHEN

SCIAMA (CONTD)
Next Friday Im taking a few
graduates of merit to London to
attend a talk by the mathematician
Roger Penrose Come along if youre
interested

(exiting)
Oh and close the door as you
leave

SCIAMA exits STEPHEN looks around at the empty LAB He goes
to the BLACKBOARD picks up a piece of CHALK looks at the
BLANK BOARD but then puts the CHALK back down and then
begins to study with RAPT AWE the ancient LABORATORY
EQUIPMENT

EXT ANGLICAN CHURCH STEPS - DAY
STEPHEN is now sitting on a STONE WALL waiting as -
- the WILDES emerge in the SUNDAY FINERY JANE peels off
from her family to talk to STEPHEN She is pleased to see
him

JANE

So I gather youve never been to
church

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 15

STEPHEN
Once upon a time

He smiles wryly at this Fairy Tale reference

JANE
Tempted to convert

He thinks about this

STEPHEN
I have a problem with the whole
Celestial Dictator premise What
are you doing for lunch Ma makes a
cracking roast

INT DINING ROOM HAWKING FAMILY HOME - DAY

Sunday family lunch A noisy eccentric bohemian
atmosphere STEPHENs father FRANK opens his HOME-MADE
WINE His sister PHILIPPA passes the plates MARY reads a BOOK

FRANK HAWKING
And Jane What are you studying

JANE
Arts Languages poetry Im
thinking of doing a PhD eventually

FRANK HAWKING
Oh What in

The HAWKINGS impressed nod approvingly at STEPHEN

JANE
(encouraged)
Medieval poetry of the Iberian
Peninsula

PHILIPPA snorts back laughter whilst the other HAWKINGS
stare blankly at JANE for a moment before silently returning
to setting the table FRANK rescues the mood -

FRANK HAWKING
Arts So what painters do you
like

JANE
Well I like--Turner

FRANK HAWKING
Really Turner To me they all
look as if theyve been left out
in the rain

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 16

STEPHEN laughs JANE shoots him a surprised look as FRANK

pours a glass of wine

JANE
AndWilliam Blake

PHILLIPA
Good heavens Surely not

FRANK HAWKING
(to JANE)
Will you try my elderflower wine

JANE
Yes please

STEPHEN
(to JANE)
Dont touch it dont touch it
Jane

Enter ISOBEL STEPHENs mother with a ROAST CHICKEN

As FRANK passes wine JANE looks nervously at STEPHEN who
smiles at her FRANK picks up the CARVING KNIFE and starts

to SHARPEN it

FRANK HAWKING
Stephen doesnt like my homemade
wine Philistine
(to STEPHEN)
If you dont watch out Ill send
you back with a couple of bottles

PHILLIPA
So Stephen youve been to church
with a good woman Are you feeling
holier than thou

STEPHEN
Positively saintly thank you

JANE
(to STEPHEN)
Youve never said why you dont
believe in God

STEPHEN
A physicist cant allow his
calculations to be muddled by a
belief in a supernatural creator

STEPHEN smiles pleased with himself and his mother and

father seem pleased with it too JANE notices -

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

JANE
Sounds less of an argument
against God than against
physicists

JANE 1 STEPHEN O She eats her food

FRANK HAWKING
(impressed)
Light or dark
(Re the chicken)
Jane Light meat or dark

JANE
Er - light please

STEPHEN
Ill wing it As usual

The old family PUNNING game has begun

PHILLIPA
Boooo

FRANK HAWKING
How plucky of you

PHILLIPA
Ohh fowl play Fowl play

STEPHEN
Stop egging him on

FRANK HAWKING
Its so nicely cocked

Hawking laughter Ha Ha JANE is bemused

ISOBEL
(sympathetic to JANE)
Dont worry about them Theyre
pun mad

FRANK is about to place a slice of CHICKEN BREAST on JANEs
PLATE —

JANE
Thats okay -
(tentatively)
- the breast is yet to come

FRANK guffaws as he plates her chicken
FRANK HAWKING
HA Marvelous Very good The

breast is yet to come Indeed it
is Well done

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

STEPHEN
Oh - Im inviting Jane to be my
partner for the May Ball

Its news to JANE shocked - but then pleased as he shoots
her a quick look and mouths

STEPHEN (CONTD)
(silently mouthing)
Will you

She SMILES and NODS delighted

EXT WILDE HOUSE - NIGHT
Standing by his PARENTs CAR STEPHEN watches (SMITTEN) as -

- JANE in a GORGEOUS GOWN walks down the path toward him

EXT COUNTRY ROADS - NIGHT

To the blaring strains of WAGNER the HAWKING car careens
across the countryside

EXT GONVILLE and CAIUS COLLEGEMAY BALL - NIGHT

On the GRAND FRONT LAWN of the COLLEGE a fairy-tale party -
LIGHTS IN THE TREES a throng of GOWNED YOUNG WOMEN and
YOUNG MEN IN BLACK TIE and TAILS all sip CHAMPAGNE on the
sequestered CROQUET LAWNS as if from a by-gone age A
BATHTUB is full of CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES ON ICE Through this
STEPHEN and JANE drift

INT GONVILLE and CAIUS COLLEGE MAY BALL - NIGHT

STEPHEN and JANE stand and watch the swirling couples on the
dance-floor sipping PUNCH

The MAY BALL is now in full and magical swing as couples
float across the lawns before the great facade of the
college

JANE
Should we dance do you think

STEPHEN
Oh no no Happy to observe the
phenomenon--but I cant possibly
imagine participating

JANE

I absolutely agree I mean who
would want to dance

( )

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 19

STEPHEN
No Im quite serious I dont
dance

JANE has a wistful look of disappointment AWKWARD SILENCE

Just then - A BLUE UV LIGHT comes on This causes great
excitement on the dance-floor All the other couples ooh
and ahh and even more people take to the floor - not so
STEPHEN and JANE

STEPHEN (CONTD)
(softly)
Do you see how the mens cuffs and
shirt-fronts how they glow more
than the dresses

JANE
(smiles expectant)
Yes
STEPHEN
Do you know why
JANE
Why
STEPHEN
TIDE
JANE

The washing powder

STEPHEN
The fluorescence in the washing
powder is caught by the UV light

JANE
Why do you know that

STEPHEN

(grins)
When stars are born and when they
die they emit UV radiation So if
we could see the night sky in
ultraviolet light almost all the
stars would disappear--and all wed
see would be these spectacular
births and deaths And I reckon--
it would look a little -

JANE stares at the glowing swirling people with STEPHENs
eyes

JANE
- like that

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

They watch impressed as - FIREWORKS are suddenly heard
EXPLODING LOUDLY

EXT TERRACELAWNSRIVERBANK - GandC COLLEGE - NIGHT MONTAGE

A) A FIRE-WORK DISPLAY - STEPHEN and JANE watch as SKY-
ROCKETS light up the sky

B) A CAROUSEL - JANE and STEPHEN ride the CAROUSEL STEPHEN
watches JANE captivated by her happiness in this moment

C) A CHAMPAGNE TENT - JANE selects a FLUTE OF CHAMPAGNE and
takes a BIG SIP to the sound of a NEARBY 1920s CHICAGO JAZZ
SWING band The GATSBY-THEMED BAR-STAFF are dressed in 1920s
TUXEDOS and FLAPPER-DRESSES

STEPHEN
So why
(passing champagne)
- why
JANE
Why
STEPHEN

Why medieval Spanish poetry
JANE surveys the gay party sipping her champagne -

JANE

(happily)
I suppose I like to time travel

STEPHEN
And what particular time periods do
you visit

JANE takes the CHAMPAGNE STEPHEN has just chosen and pours
half of his into her glass

JANE
The Twenties is always fun

STEPHEN
The roaring twenties
Cheers
They CLINK GLASSES and sip their champagne laughing
STEPHEN (CONTD)

So--The 1920s A good time for
poetry was it

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

JANE
Seek then No learning from
Starry Men Who follow with Optic
Glass The Whirling Ways of Stars

that Pass
STEPHEN
Ouch
JANE
Was it -

They move off across the NEARBY DANCE-FLOOR and PASS the
JAZZ BAND en route to the LIGHTED FOOT-BRIDGE spanning a
river under which LIGHTED PUNTS drift by

They arrive at the FOOT-BRIDGE with its view of the BRIDGE

OF SIGHS

JANE (CONTD)
- was it a good time for science

STEPHEN
A smashing time actually Spacetime
was born

JANE
Spacetime

STEPHEN
Space and Time finally got
together People always thought
they were too dissimilar couldnt
possibly work out But then along
comes Einstein the ultimate match-—
maker and decided that space and
time not only had a future but
had been married all along

JANE
The perfect couple

PUNTS with CATHERINE WHEELS are moored nearby

D) FOOT-BRIDGE

JANE and STEPHEN stop in the middle of the bridge STEPHEN
looks up at the STARS bright sparkling JANE does the same

STEPHEN
Well thats astonishing isnt it

Silence then -

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 22

JANE
(seriously)
In the beginning was the heaven
and the earth and the earth was
without form and darkness--
darkness was upon the face of the
deep

STEPHEN moved looks at her

STEPHEN
Would you dance with me

He takes her hand and starts to DANCE with her to the music
and then tilts his head and KISSES her

CAMERA pulls back to reveal the couple kissing on the
FOOTBRIDGE the punts floating underneath the night magical
the lovely slow jazz drifting over the scene

EXT FRONT DOOR WILDE FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

opens the door to get the MILK Looks down PAN down to - a
BOX of TIDE WASHING POWDER She picks it up - looks around
for STEPHEN - smiles delighted - IN LOVE

EXT PLATFORM CAMBRIDGE TRAIN STATION - DAY

SCIAMA and STEPHEN and PHYSICISTS 12 and 3 arrive late on
the platform The train is already pulling in SCIAMA and
the OTHER THREE all run for it But STEPHEN is making his way
up the steps not running - putting on a brave face When
STEPHEN arrives just in time the PHYSICISTS 123 pull
STEPHEN on to the train

INT MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
As they whistle along English countryside in the background
SCIAMA studies STEPHEN then returns his attention to his
newspaper when he meets his eyes
INT KINGS COLLEGE CLASSROOM - LONDON - DAY
ROGER PENROSE MATHEMATICIAN gives a passionate talk
before a small audience in a small room The blackboard is
crammed with calculations and diagrams

ROGER PENROSE

So what do we know Let me

rephrase that--what do the
equations tell us finally

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

He turns the blackboard over A blank board

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
How about a simple diagram

Smiles small laughter from the audience STEPHEN looks
especially relieved

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
A star more than three times the
size of our sun

He draws a circle on the board

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
ought to end its life how With
a collapse the gravitational
forces of the entire mass
overcoming the electromagnetic
forces of individual atoms and so
collapsing inwards If the star is
massive enough it will continue
this collapse creating a black
hole - where the warping of
spacetime is so great that nothing
can escape not even light It
gets

He draws a smaller circle inside the first

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
Smaller smaller

An even smaller circle

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
The star in fact gets denser as
atoms--even subatomic particles--
get literally crushed smashed into
smaller and smaller space And at
its end point what are we left
with

He draws a point

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
A point A spacetime
singularity

STEPHEN is captivated

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
With extraordinary properties
Infinite density Space and time
come to a stop All of the known
laws of science--they just stop
working

ROGER PENROSE (CONTD)
What Ive just shown is that this
happens in every black hole Its
really happening out there To
real stars--and its happening right
now

STEPHEN smiles - seeing his future revealed

INT MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
SCIAMA and his students returning home

As his friends talk excitedly STEPHEN is silently staring
down at the CIRCULATING COFFEE in front of him into which
he pours CREAM

SLOWLY CLOCKWISE - the cream is spread outward by the
circulating coffee until it looks like a SPIRAL GALAXY

As he stares deep in thought the SPIRAL of CREAM pulses

If--if--so--If--Einstein is right
if--general relativity is correct
then the universe is expanding
yes -

- Alright -

- which means - that--if you

get smaller and smaller

So what if--if I reverse the
process all the way to see what
happened at the beginning of Time
itself The universe smaller and
smaller denser and denser hotter
and hotter as we approach its

Whats that

The DOCTOR despite his unsentimental nature draws a deep
breath This is not the speech he wants to make

SENIOR DOCTOR
Its a progressive neurological
disorder that destroys the cells
in the brain that control
essential muscle activity such as
speaking walking--breathing--
swallowing The signals that
muscles must receive in order to
move are disrupted cut off The
result is--gradual muscle decay
a wasting away Eventually the
ability to control voluntary
movement is--lost--entirely

GROWING INTIMACY

She exits JONATHAN smiles at STEPHEN who is staring back at
him

JONATHAN
(to STEPHEN)
So - Stephen Er - Jane tells
me

JONATHAN picks up STEPHENs fork spears a cube of steak

JONATHAN (CONTD)
--you have a beautiful theorem
that proves that

JONATHAN offers up the steak but STEPHENs glare makes him
aware this isnt welcome He lowers the fork again

JONATHAN (CONTD)
that--that the universe had a
beginning
JANE returns with the a JUG OF WATER and GLASSES on a TRAY
STEPHEN
(testily his slurring
not easily understood)
That was my - PhD thesis

JONATHAN looks to JANE for a translation

You no longer believe in the

What one believes -

JANE JONATHAN
is irrelevant is irrelevant
JANE

in physics
JONATHAN looks to JANE hoping he has not caused offence

JONATHAN
Oh is that so

JANE
(annoyance showing)
Stephens done a U-turn The big
new idea is that the universe has
no boundaries at all No
boundaries no beginning No
beginning -

JONATHAN
- no God Really
(to STEPHEN)
Fascinating Because Id
understood youd proven the need
for a Creator My mistake

STEPHEN
No Mine

JONATHAN
(understanding this)
Yours Your mistake

JONATHAN is surprised by this sharp reply (He also sees
that this matter is a CAUSE OF DIVISION between JANE and
STEPHEN )

JANE
Stephen is looking for a single
law that governs all the forces
in the universe So God must die

JONATHAN
Why must God die I dont see

STEPHEN doesnt react so JANE spears a PEA on her FORK
then picks up a SECOND FORK and spears a LARGE BOILED
POTATO with the other

( )
THE THEORY of EVERYTHING

JANE
The two great pillars of physics
are -
(the PEA)

- Quantum Theory the laws that
govern the very small--electrons
particles so on--and General
Relativity

JONATHAN
Oh yes - Einstein

JANE

-Einsteins theory

(the POTATO)
Which governs the very large
planets and such--but Quantum -

(raises the PEA)
and -

(raises the POTATO)
Relativity

JONATHAN
They re--different

JANE
They dont remotely play by the
same rules Peas are chaotic and
dont behave predictably at all -

With her pea fork she stirs some more peas on her plate -
creates chaos

JONATHAN
Unlike--potatoes -
JANE
Which you can set your watch by
STEPHEN
(smiling)

Very good

Even STEPHEN has begun to begrudgingly enjoy this even as
he starts COUGHING

JANE gets up and goes to pat STEPHENs back over the
following

JANE
If the world were all potatoes
easy--you could trace a precise
beginning as Stephen once did a
moment of Creation Hallelujah
God lives

But if you want to incorporate
peas into the menu which Stephen
now wants to do then it all goes

STEPHEN
Tits up

JONATHAN looks to JANE for translation again -

JANE
Tits up Haywire Becomes a
Godless mess

JONATHAN
Oh dear

JANE
Einstein hated peas Quantum
Theory God doesnt play dice
with the universe he said

STEPHEN
Seems he not only plays dice -

JANE
Seems he not only plays dice -

STEPHEN
- he throws them - where we cant
find them
(smiles)

JANE
- he throws them -

JONATHAN
- where we cant find them How
inconvenient

JANE
Stephens swapped his telescope
(un-spears the spud)
- for a microscope
(eats the pea)
Order for chaos--hoping to find a
law to cover both

JONATHAN impressed looks at STEPHEN

JONATHAN
Looking for the world in a grain

ELAINE holds the E-TRAN BOARD and writes down a letter then
looks up at STEPHEN - sees through the clear perspex
immediately what group he is looking at She doesnt have to
call out the colours - knows them (See her POV of him
through the board so we establish the eye-line principle)
She is BRILLIANT at this

STEPHENs eyes FLICK from GROUP to GROUP no BLINKING going
on

STEPHEN sits in the armchair propped up by cushions while

TECHNICIAN bolts the NEW COMPUTER SCREEN onto STEPHENs

WHEELCHAIR JANE watches

TECHNICIAN
Almost there

JANE
How does it work

TECHNICIAN

A guy called Walt Woltosz invented
the software Uses a very simple
interface that scans through the
alphabet and allows each letter to
be selected one by one Using this
technique the Professor can expect
to write at about four words per
minute

ELAINE enters -

JANE
(After initial dismay)
Better than one a minute

TECHNICIAN
What Ive done is--use components
from a telephone answering system
actually-- to convert the written
text into synthesized speech The
voice sounds a bit robotic but
(its ready)
Okay Shall we give it a try

CODE REFLECTED in the glass is the WIDE-EYED FACE OF

JANE and ELAINE sit on the couch together watching -

The TECHNICIAN demonstrates - builds a sentence for
STEPHEN selecting one LETTER at a time STEPHEN is all

STEPHEN looks back at the screen then CLICKS ONCE The
COMPUTER comes to life and says STEPHENs first words in

ELAINE

STEPHEN looks bewildered

He sags frustrated that he was not fast enough to set her
straight - but then she comes back in -

Its so sad and bizarre and they both realise it in this

him and turning her back hiding her face

STEPHEN watches her as aware of the enormous significance of
this moment as she - then slowly - slowly - motors toward

gently with his own lifeless foot the way a pony will nudge

sadly to his screen and then clicks the pad in his hand

There are some things I cannot
do But They are mostly the
things I dont particularly want
to do anyway

There ought to be something very

conditions of the universe - and
what can be more special than that
there is no boundary And there
should be no boundary to
