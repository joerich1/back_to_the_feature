inside

INT MARCO’S BEDROOM - DAY

MARCO AND SERENE early 20s sit uncomfortably close together
on top a TWIN SIZED BED Marco is handsome A sensible guy
cursed with being a romantic at heart He stares solemnly at
Serene Serene is a natural beauty and knows it Her face
lacks emotion She doesn’t look at Marco

MARCO
I don’t want you to leave I know
that’s being selfish of me to say
but I didn’t want you to leave
without me saying it

SERENE
I don’t want to leave you either
Marc but

MARCO

(stopping her)
I know I know New York This
opportunity doesn’t come everyday

Serene tries to adjust her seat but almost slips off the
bed Marco doesn’t budge

MARCO (CONT’D)

SERENE
So you understand

MARCO
(not at all)
Sure

He turns away from her He looks like he might cry
MARCO (CONTD)
Still sucks though

SERENE
I know

Serene now turns to look at him We notice her eyes more
apathetic than sad It’s clear this isn’t as hard for her as
it is him
MARCO
It’s not fair Not after I waited
two years and now I finally have
you

SERENE
I wouldn’t say you waited

MARCO
Well definitely wanted

She sighs She searches for something comforting to say

SERENE
If it’s meant to be it’1l be

Marco rolls his eyes He isn’t exactly a firm believer of
fate

MARCO
I don’t want to wait for whenever
its meant to be I care about you
and I want you now

SERENE
(bites her lip)
I care about you too

Marco jerks his head

MARCO
(not the answer he was
expecting)
But you don’t want me

SERENE
I have mixed feelings

Marco backs away surprised

MARCO
Mixed feelings About what
SERENE
About you and me

Marco mouth hangs open dumbfounded This is obviously news
to him

SERENE (CONTD)
It’s just that I’m going to be --

MARCO

He watches her go She STOPS as she reaches the door Marco’s
face lights up

SERENE
(turning around)
Oh and one more thing

Marco holds his breath this is what he’s been waiting for
SERENE (CONTD)
Do yourself a favor and buy a
bigger bed It’s like sleeping with

a ten year old

Marco’s face falls She leaves
INT GUITA’S BEDROOM - DAY

A balding distinguished older man in his late 60’s dresses
in front of a full size mirror This is MR LOPEZ A man of
Hispanic descent who traveled to American to be raised and
molded into what is now a somewhat successful lawyer Beside
him is a large bed where an array of ties are laid out He
picks one up looking at himself in the mirror

An older woman around ten years his senior steps out from
the bathroom This is GUITA A Cuban woman enamored with the
idea of love but having been heartbroken enough times to now
know love is not a fairy tale

She enters the room Neither acknowledges the other

Guita moves over to the other side of the bed grabs the
remote and turns on the television After a long pause

MR LOPEZ
(looking into the mirror)
They’re coming to kill you today
you know

Wondering whether or not she heard correctly she turns to
Mr Lopez She speaks with a thick Cuban accent

GUITA
What

MR LOPEZ
(without looking away)
You know what I’m talking about

Guita is at a lost for words Then from a fire burning inside
-- she SNAPS Her overly dramatic Cuban roots surface

GUITA
(livid)
How dare you threaten me

Mr Lopez doesn’t respond Beat

GUITA (CONTD)
Does your whores even know what a
moron attorney you are You
couldn’t win a case if you were
fucking the judge

Mr Lopez remains silent
GUITA (CONTD)
Well let your whores come There
hasn’t been anyone born in this
world yet that can kill me

Mr Lopez finishes in the mirror Without even a glance he
moves to the closet grabs his coat puts it on Guita shakes
with anger -- prepared to ignite World War III

Mr Lopez gets to the door

GUITA (CONTD)
(fuming)
Aren’t you going to say something
you coward

He stops at the door

MR LOPEZ
(softly)
Good luck

Guita EXPLODES She grabs a handful of jewelry resting on a
night stand HURLS it The jewelry hits the door and falls to
the floor He’s gone

A typical San Diego day Perfect weather The waves break
onto the shore

INT MARCO’S BEDROOM - DAY

Marco sits at his desk as he fumbles with a WEBCAM on his
computer He turns it on and sees himself on the screen He
studies himself closely examining his face and hair then he
takes off his shirt and stands up FLEXING into the camera

A VOICE comes from behind

ERIC (0S)
Youre pathetic

Marco whips around to see his fraternal twin brother ERIC
standing at the doorway shaking his head in disappointment
Eric is dressed in hospital scrubs

Marco quickly grabs his shirt and pulls it back on Eric
enters the room

ERIC
Don’t Please just don’t It’s
too sad to hear whatever is going
to come out of your mouth

Marco gives him a “fuck you” look then returns his attention
to the webcam

ERIC (CONTD)
Are you planning to use that with
Serene

MARCO
That’s the plan

ERIC
Did you two even date for more than
a month

MARCO
(annoyed)
Yes We dated for two

ERIC
So it was over before it started
then Well you know what they say
when a bus pulls away another

MARCO
(defensive)
It’s not over We’re still talking

Eric laughs

ERIC

I don’t give a shit how much you
talk You could talk until you’ve
beaten your meat senseless with all
the awkward phone sex you’ll try to
have it doesn’t change the fact
that she’s gone and youre still
here

MARCO
(blind hope)
Yeah well maybe it can work

ERIC
It wont
MARCO
You never know

ERIC
(pressing)
It won’t work Marc

Marco sighs frustrated Eric goes on

ERIC (CONTD)
Why would you put yourself through
that anyway These are the years
where you try to fuck as many girls
as you can as much as you can The
last thing you should do is be ina
relationship with a girl you can
only see through video feed

MARCO
Yeah well I don’t want another
girl

ERIC

And what You don’t think she’s
going to meet someone else

Marco shoots Eric a death look

ERIC (CONTD)
(counting with his
fingers)
She’s young she’s hot she’s ina
big new city What else do I have
to say Come on Don’t be so
naive

Marco drops his face into his hands
MARCO
Why do these things have to happen
to me
Eric groans He gives up
ERIC
Find a new toy to play with It’s

the easiest way

Eric looks at the webcam sees himself
ERIC (CONTD)
Did you record that by any chance
I love watching myself be an
asshole and you being a pitiful
dumbass

Marco gives him the finger Eric checks his watch
ERIC (CONTD)
Aren’t you going to be late for
work
Marco hits himself in the forehead
MARCO
Aw shit
EXT GUITA’S HOUSE (SAN FRANCISCO) - DAY
A quiet suburban neighborhood On the top floor of one house
a window is open The curtain blows in the wind

other a PHONE
INT ALINA’S KITCHEN - DAY

Mami you’ve been saying that for
three years now

GUITA
I mean it this time I swear No

Guita looks out the window sees a DARK SEDAN cruising slowly
down the street
GUITA (CONTD)
It’s that hija de puta secretary of
his I know it in my soul

ALINA
How do you know Mami Do you even
know she looks like

GUITA
Of course I know what she looks
like chica
(beat)
She’s beautiful

Guita watches the car as it drives past the house up the
road and disappears

GUITA (CONTD)
(gets an idea)
I know what I will to do

Guita drops the knife marches over to the closet

GUITA (CONTD)
(rummaging through the
closet)
I’m going to call her and tell her
that if she doesn’t quit today I
will stab her with

Guita pulls out a LARGE UMBRELLA with a sharp and pointy tip

(mouth full)
With what
Guita gleams menacingly at the umbrella for a while
ALINA (CONTD)
(stops chewing)

Mami Are you still there

Guita snaps out it Shaking her head she quickly stuffs the
umbrella back inside the closet

GUITA
Nothing Nevermind

Guita returns to the window and picks the knife up Outside
the window a VAN with tinted windows parks across the
street Guita studies it with interest

GUITA (CONTD)

Alina if I don’t call you back in
an hour I want you to call the
police

ALINA
(growing uneasy)
Mami stop

Outside the van doors open and two middle-aged WOMEN exit
the car She tightly grips her knife

GUITA
What a son-of-a-bitch

ALINA
(puts down her sandwich)
Mami will you stop

Outside the two women cross the street toward Guita’s house
Guita quickly ducks out of view

GUITA
(whispering)
Alina when I kill him I only ask
one thing

ALINA
(afraid)
Why are you whispering

GUITA
Don’t hire a defense attorney
Because when I’m on stand and the
judge ask me whether or not I
killed Manuel I’11 tell him “YES
I did it And if that pedazo de
mierda were to come back I swear to
god I will do it again and again
and again

ALINA
Mami why don’t you just leav--

Guita hangs up
She lifts her head just enough to peak out the window She

watches the two women stand on her lawn studying a piece of
paper then look up at the house

Guita slowly raises her knife

Out the window across the street a old woman comes out of
her house She shouts something to the two women on Guita’s
lawn They run over to her and embrace her -- just two
sisters visiting relatives

Guita exhales with relief having been on the verge of a
heart attack She turns away from the window and slides down
the wall She starts to CRY Then she slaps herself hard

GUITA
(ashamed)
Stupido

She takes a minute to piece herself back together gets up
She marches over to the closet pulls out a suitcase

tosses it aside

Once the bike is removed the real magnitude of the damage

knees are bleeding it even looks like he’s bleeding out of
his eyes how does that happen

Marco looks around him notices people coming out of their

door opens Someone gets out She gleams with delight and
tries to unbuckle her seatbelt

A loud GROAN erupts from the back of the plane -- followed by
a hard THUD

Everyone turns toward the commotion Guita doesn’t notice as

Several people RUSH TOWARD THE COMMOTION

emergency

For the first time Guita turns back to see what all the fuss
is about An OVERWEIGHT MAN lies on the floor clutching his
arm and gasping for air She turns back to the flight
attendent

GUITA
(indifferent )
I really have to use the restroom

The flight attendant hardly pays her any attention focused
on the man on the floor

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(distracted)
I’m sorry maam but you’1ll wait
until after we’ve dealt with this
Now please take your seat

Guita hesitates for a moment then unbelievably -- taps the
attendant on the shoulder He becomes irritated turns back
surprised to see she’s still standing there

GUITA
It will only take me a couple
minutes I promise

The flight attendant looks at her as if she’s crazy He loses
it --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

their ears to the door After a while the sound becomes

clearer -- it’s LAUGHTER It grows louder and more
hysterical

watery (but in the good way)

Marco Eric and Alina all are sitting at the dinner table
trying their best to contain their food as they roar with
laughter Their focus is on GUITA standing in the center of
the room as she animatedly re-enacts the events on the plane

GUITA
I use to like the window seat but
now that I’m old I prefer the

aisle seat you know
(MORE)
Everyone by the point is in tears Guita takes a seat

GUITA (CONTD)
because it’s easier to get to the
bathroom Well I’m waiting and
waiting for this person to finally
get out when miraculously -- he
does so I get up to pee quando
this SON-OF-A-BITCH has the nerve
to have a stroke in the middle of
the flight Can you believe that
So quando I try to go this steward
man pushes me down looking at me as
if I was loca All I wanted to
do was go to the bathroom

pleased with her performance

MARCO
(catching his breath)
Why do these things always happen
to you Guita

GUITA
I don’t know papi I must have done
some terrible thing in my past
life Perhaps I was Jack the
Ripper

Alina stops laughing and suddenly becomes serious

ALINA
Why must you always be so dramatic

GUITA
(obviously)
Because it’s the truth

Alina shakes her head annoyed

GUITA (CONTD)
(turns to Marco)
So Marco Alina tells me you
broke up with your little
girlfriend

ERIC
(groans)
Oh please don’t start I can’t
listen to him bitch and moan
anymore

Marco looks down at his food embarrassed Guita leans in

close

GUITA
(whispers )
It’s okay my love We are in the
same boat you and I

ERIC
(changing subject)
I can’t believe Mr Lopez was
cheating on you Guita He seemed --
I don’t know good
(disappointed)

(angry)
Terrible

MARCO
(feeling bad)
Guita I’m sorry

GUITA
(shrugs )
So is my life my love It never
ends

MARCO

(curiously)
It’s almost too hard to believe I
mean I even liked him more than I
liked Victor

(turns to Alina)
Mom why you divorced him I’11 never
know God himself could have been
jealous of that man

The room suddenly becomes uncomfortably quiet Guita mutters
something indiscernible in Spanish

MARCO (CONT’D)
(confused)

ALINA
(cuts in)
I’m sorry Marco but trust me
Victor was no saint

MARCO
(not convinced)
He could have fooled me

GUITA

(as if it were an absurd

question)

Marco and Eric scan the house

They both look at Alina

It’s immaculate

ALINA
(shakes her head)
Don’t even bother

ERIC
(pressing on)
So then what

ALINA
That’s actually what we wanted to
talk to you two about

Marco and Eric turns to each scared

MARCO
(reluctantly)
Talk about what

ALINA
(mockingly)
Guita wants to live in Florida

GUITA
Your mother seems to think it’s
some kind of joke

ALINA
Because it is

Guita ignores her

GUITA
It’s actually kind of a funny
story I applied for an apartment
in Florida a couple years ago when
I first had my suspicions

ALINA
Well youre sure of it now

Guita ignores her again continues

GUITA
This apartment I applied for is in
a home so it’s not too nice but
the good news is it’s only 140
dollars a month Well I was
eighth on the list Which means
that eight people had to die before
I could get the apartment So
obviously I assumed I was never
going to get it I brushed it from
my mind

(MORE)

GUITA (CONTD)
But then as luck would have it --
if you could call it luck

MARCO
(can’t believe it)
They died All eight people

GUITA
(nods as-a-matter-of-
factly)
Can you believe that

Marco and Eric are stunned Alina can only shake her head

GUITA (CONTD)
So there you have it

Marco and Eric take a moment to process the information

MARCO
Okay but what do you need us for

GUITA
Well I no longer have a car because
your bastard godfather Mr Lopez
took it and I can’t buy a new one
because as you can guess I’m

broke
MARCO
(not liking the sound of
this)
Uh oh
GUITA

(not finished yet)
Just wait Well your cousin
Pedro I don’t know if you’ve know
him but he lives close to here I
called and he offered me his old
car Bless his soul

GUITA
Precisely

ERIC
(shakes his head)
Youre crazy
Guita doesn’t flinch

ALINA
(to Guita)
See I told you tu fueras loca
She’s serious

ERIC

Well don’t look at me
school

(points to Marco)
Ask him He’s the one that just got
fired He has nothing to do But
then again unless your goal is to
knock off every drifter you pass by
then I wouldn’t have this guy drive

I have med

me to save my life

Guita turns to Marco her eyes shine with desperation

MARCO
(skeptical)
I don’t know

ERIC

You don’t know What else do you

have going on

MARCO
(defensive)

I have a life to piece back
together I have to find a job I

have to make rent

GUITA
Ill pay you

The room becomes silent again

protests begin

ALINA
Absolutely not Guita you
cannot afford to do this
right now You don’t have any
money

I have to --

Then after a beat the

ERIC
No fucking way Why does he
always get bailed out of
everything This is bullshit
He needs to learn his lesson

Marco and Guita remain silent until the barking subsides

Then

MARCO

I thought you just said you were

broke

GUITA
It won’t be much A little for rent
and I’ll pay for your flight home
I have a free flight anyway after
the man’s stroke

ERIC
(pissed off)
Just what he needs someone else to
bail him out
(looks to Alina)
Youre going to let her do this

ALINA
(raises her hands in
defeat)
I already told her not to but
It’s her money

Guita stares deeper into Marco He grows increasingly
nervous

GUITA
(pleading)
Marco My beautiful brilliant
grandson Help your Guita

Marco turns to his mother and brother scolding him He turns
back to Guita her face brimming with hope and desperation

GUITA (CONT’D)
(begging)
Come on papi Then at least we can
be miserable together

He relents

MARCO
Fine

ERIC
(pounds on the table)
Unbelievable

Guita rushes over to Marco showers him with kisses

GUITA
Thank you thank you thank you
Youre the greatest grandson in the
world

After the overabundant display of gratitude commences Marco
turns curiously to Alina and Guita

MARCO
So what kind of car are we driving

INT GARAGE - DAY
A shit colored paint peeled rusty 92’ OLDSMOBILE sedan
sits in the middle of the garage -- This car is no less than

total piece of shit by any length of the imagination

Everyone stands around the car staring at it as if it were
some antic salvaged from the dump

MARCO
Is it too late to change my mind
ERIC
(laughing)
I’ve taken shits that look better
than this
GUITA

Look who’s being dramatic now
Marco circles the car inspecting it
MARCO

Oldsmobile I remembered driving in
one of these when I was just a kid

GUITA
Of course you do this is the
car
MARCO
(confused)

This is the same car But I was
like five Why would anyone keep
this

GUITA
It’s a classic Mr Lopez and I
sold it to Pedro almost twenty
years ago and he kept it

ERIC
He could of kept it inside the
garage at least

MARCO
(incredulously)
This car won’t make it out of the
garage let alone Miami

ALINA
(reassuringly)
Don’t worry Pedro assured us that
the car is very reliable

ERIC
As long as what You don’t touch
it

ALINA

Just be careful with it Don’t play

around with it drive carefully
(remembers something)

Oh And you have to carry this

Alina goes to the trunk pops it takes out a JUG OF WATER

MARCO
Water

ALINA
Yes hopefully you’1l have more
than enough in here

Marco and Eric move curiously toward the trunk They look
inside Marco take a big gulp Eric explodes with laughter

Inside the trunk are SEVERAL JUGS OF WATER

MARCO
What the hell’s this for

ALINA
The car tends to overheat When
smoke starts to rise from the hood
you drain this into the coolant and
it should cool down

MARCO
How often does that happen

ALINA
(non-comforting)
I’m not sure

MARCO
(distressed)
This is going to be a disaster

ERIC
That’s a fact

ALINA
Have faith
(looks at Marco then to
Guita)
That’s your problem You two have
no faith

Marco looks to Guita seeking some kind of reassurance

GUITA
Like my grandfather used to say
“Life never gives you enough of
what you don’t want”

EXT DRIVEWAY -— DAY

The car is parked in the middle of the driveway Marco loads
several heavy suitcases into the trunk Eric stands to the
side playing with his phone Alina opens the passenger door
for Guita and helps her inside

Marco groans in pain as he lifts the last over-stuffed
suitcase into the trunk

MARCO
(looks over at Eric)
Thanks for the help bro

ERIC
(not caring)
I think you got it

Marco shuts the trunk He takes a breather

MARCO
You sure you don’t have anymore
Guita Maybe we can take the house
too

Guita tries to adjust her seat to make herself comfortable
but to no avail She shouts out the window

GUITA
I’m the one that left papi My
entire life are in those suitcases

Marco walks over to the driver’s side As he’s about to climb
in Alina WRAPS her arms around him She starts to CRY

MARCO
What now

ALINA
(crying)
Please be careful

MARCO
Careful It was your guy’s idea to
travel across the country in this
death trap

Alina cries harder

MARCO (CONTD)
(feeling guilty)

Don’t worry alright We’re going

to be just fine All were going to

do is sleep eat and drive

GUITA
(out the window)
Don’t forget cry I already began
this morning

Alina chuckles She wipes her face

ALINA
Don’t forget to call me okay

MARCO
Stop worrying

Marco gets into the car
MARCO (CONT’D)
(to Eric)
Later bro

Eric forces a small wave

Marco turns they keys into the ignition the car starts He
rolls down the window

MARCO (CONT’D)
Good so far

ALINA
I love you

MARCO
I love you too

Marco nudges Guita to say something She leans over Marco and
shouts

GUITA
Pray for us

The car pulls away from the driveway Alina and Eric wave
goodbye

And it begins

EXT OLDSMOBILE - DAY

INSERT TITLE CARD
DAY 1

The Oldsmobile cruises along the freeway

INT OLDSMOBILE - DAY

Marco drives while talking into a blue tooth in his ear
Guita sits in the passenger seat holding a jar of VASELINE as
she looks into her sun visor’s vanity mirror and rubs it into
her face

MARCO
You did Wow that’s great news
Congratulations Yeah I can

imagine how exciting it must be
Looks like things are working
out

(covers his ear)
What Oh yeah of course don’t

Marco is cut off He takes off his blue tooth and tosses it
aside frustrated

GUITA
(without taking her eyes
off the mirror)
Was that her

MARCO
She got an internship She’s not
coming back

GUITA
You were hoping she wouldn’t find a
job

Marco notices Guita putting on the Vaseline he stares
curiously

MARCO
(distracted)
No Of course not I’m happy for
her I just hoped that maybe

GUITA
She would come back

MARCO
(admits it)
Well yeah
GUITA
I’m sorry my love but life isn’t

so kind
Guita rubs Vaseline onto her lips

MARCO
(can’t stand it any
longer)
Guita what are you doing

GUITA
(rubs Vaseline under her
eyes)
Before you and Eric were born I
used to buy very beautiful very
expensive creams and lotions that
made my face look and smell like a

supermodel’s chocha but after
you two I haven’t been able to
afford it anymore so I use

pinche petroleum jelly

Marco grimaces disturbed by Guita’s bluntness Guita seals
the Vaseline jar and flips up the sun visor A beat

GUITA (CONTD)
Why don’t you turn on the radio

MARCO
What do you want to hear

GUITA
Anything I just like the sound

Marco turns on the radio and is surprised to find it works
He scans the stations until he finds a song he likes He
leaves it
GUITA (CONTD)
Who sings this song

MARCO
Phoenix I love them
GUITA
(listening)
I like it
Marco chuckles
MARCO
Do you even understand what they’re
saying
GUITA

Not a word but that doesn’t
matter That isn’t what music is
about

MARCO
No then what is it about then

GUITA
It’s about how it makes everything
a little bit more tolerable

Marco grins turns it up

GUITA (CONTD)
So how are you feeling

MARCO
Sad like I miss being happy

GUITA
Yes well happiness doesn’t last
However misery now that can last
a lifetime

Marco frowns not at all comforted

GUITA (CONTD)
(sympathetic)
It’s okay to be sad What happened
to you is a sad thing

MARCO
I just don’t meet that many girls
ya know I find one I have
something special with and look

GUITA
I’m sorry my love but that happens

one trust me and everything
youre feeling right now it’s
normal Youre going to be sad for
little while and some days will
even be worse than before but
after a while you’ll start
feeling better Trust me I know
I’m a professional But for right

now if you want to be sad be
sad There is nothing wrong with
that

Marco silently takes this in

GUITA (CONTD)
And you think what youre going
through is bad Try seventy-three
years of heartbreak

Marco scrunches his face like he just saw someone get hit by
a train

MARCO
Brutal

A beat Guita studies Marco

GUITA
Youre a romantic aren’t you

MARCO
(hesitant)
I don’t know
GUITA

and strangle her

MARCO
(shrugs )

Marco rubs his head getting a headache

MARCO

GUITA

Marco SLAMS his hand on the table

MARCO
You think every girl on earth is
gorgeous I’m sorry Guita but you
have terrible taste in women

GUITA
I’m just saying If I were a man

MARCO
I know what youre saying I’m not
interested okay

Guita gives up There’s an awkward silence
MARCO (CONTD)
It’s not like I’m in the mood to do
anything about it anyway

GUITA
Of course I know that

Charlie returns with Marco’s brownie She places it in front
of him
CHARLIE

Charlie leaves Marco continues to grin at Guita

MARCO (CONT’D)

Guita shrugs

GUITA
I know what I saw

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Marco lies on the only bed talking on his cell phone

MARCO
(agitated)
Ya I know bro Okay She
offered what am I supposed to
do Yeah Lucky Bye

Marco tosses the phone Guita enters from the bathroom She
shuffles over lifelessly to the bed You would of thought she
just hiked up Mount Everest

GUITA
This is it I’m in my last moments
now

Marco finds the remote and turns on the television Guita
flops down beside him GROANS

Marco can’t help but smirk at Guita’s melodramatics

GUITA (CONTD)
Who were you talking to

MARCO
Eric

GUITA
Is he okay

MARCO
Yeah He just called to make me
feel guilty again about taking your
money

GUITA
I offered

MARCO
That’s what I said but he says you
can’t afford it and that I’m being
selfish

GUITA
Well he’s right
(off Marco’s look)
I can’t afford it

MARCO
(upset)
Guita

She pats him playfully on the arm

GUITA
I’m joking It’s fine don’t worry
I’ll live

Marco buries his face in a pillow

GUITA (CONTD)
You sure you don’t want to ask for
a mattress or something I’m sure
you don’t want to sleep next to
your Guita

MARCO
(through pillow)
I don’t mind

Guita smiles happy with the response

Marco keeps his head buried underneath the pillow Guita
shuts her eyes

GUITA
Are you feeling better
MARCO
(muffled)
Not really
GUITA
Give it time You will

A long beat

GUITA (CONTD)
Did you know when you and Eric were
young just babies that everyone
thought I loved you more

Marco comes out from under the pillow he looks at Guita

MARCO
Really Why

GUITA
Because you were so affectionate
you loved being held When I walked
into the room your face would light
up So I may have paid a little
more attention to you therefore
everyone thought you were my
favorite

Marco cracks a tiny smile

GUITA (CONTD)
But of course I love you both the
same

MARCO
(smile fades)
Of course
Guita turns to the side moments from sleep

GUITA

Keep watching the tv It’1l keep

your mind off of her Goodnight my

love

MARCO
Goodnight Guita

Marco returns to watching the television Guita turns toward
him whispers

GUITA
Don’t tell Eric but youre still
my favorite

She turns away Marco watches television He smiles

INT MOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Marco lies turned away from Guita holding a pillow over his
head

The room is SHAKING with the THUNDEROUS ROAR of Guita’s
SNORING

Marco eyes are peeled open terrified

Unable to stand it any longer he climbs out of bed

EXT MOTEL - NIGHT
Marco stands at a vending machine Behind him is the diner
from earlier He pushes a button for a soda on the vending
machine and waits

VOICES sound in the distance He turns to see the back door
of the diner swing OPEN as a MAN and WOMAN exit conversing

Marco watches as the two give their good-byes and parts ways
The woman heads in Marco’s direction to a parking lot nearby
As she grows nearer we notice that it’s CHARLIE Marco

immediately grows nervous

There’s the sound of a soda can falling Marco whips back
around and quickly snatches it up He moves to leave

CHARLIE (0S)

Hey
It’s too late She’s spotted him Marco slowly turns to face
her He tries to act as cool as possible
MARCO
(smooth )
Hey

Marco nervously opens the soda and takes a sip

CHARLIE
Well if it isn’t the love of my
life

Marco is thrown by the response and CHOKES His face turns
red Charlie watches all this with much amusement A beat

MARCO
(catching his breath)
Yeah sorry about that It was my
grandmother She’s crazy I was
just set on proving her wrong

CHARLIE
(skeptical)
Ah huh

MARCO
(embarrassed)
It was stupid
She studies him for a brief moment He grows uneasy

CHARLIE
So what are you two doing here

MARCO
Were just passing through We’re
taking a little roadtrip

CHARLIE
Just you and your grandma
MARCO
Yup
CHARLIE
Wow
(touched)

That’s sweet

MARCO
I sort of didn’t have a choice to
be honest

CHARLIE
Oh come on I saw you two together
It was very cute

Marco looks confused

CHARLIE (CONTD)
It’s a compliment trust me I
don’t know that many guys with
close relationships with their
grandmothers

MARCO
Yeah well The woman’s a saint

Charlie grins

MARCO (CONTD)
(realizing something)
How rude of me
(extends his hand)
I’m Marco

Charlie takes it They shake

CHARLIE
Charlie Nice to meet you Marco

MARCO
Nice to meet you Charlie

Beat

CHARLIE
I wish I had time to stick around
and chat but I actually have a
party to get to

MARCO
I’m jealous

Marco takes another sip of his soda

CHARLIE
Wanna come

Marco chokes again Charlie can’t help but laugh this time

MARCO
To a party Now Here

CHARLIE
Sure Nice house An abundance of
liquor

MARCO
(hesitant)
I don’t know I can’t just really
ditch my grandma I think that
would define what it would mean to
be bad grandson

CHARLIE
(reasoning)
You just broke up with your
girlfriend right You need to have
some fun You need a momentary
lapse of memory

MARCO
It’s tempting Really

CHARLIE
It’s up to you This might be the
only bit of fun you have on this
trip

Marco bites his lip She’s probably right
MARCO

(gives in)
Lets go

EXT HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

Marco and Charlie are in the backyard of a large modern style
house packed with people drinking dancing and making
out They each hold a bottle of beer as they watch a DRUNK
PARTY GOER RIDE A BICYCLE AROUND THE POOL to only be CUT
OFF by a small BARBIE MOBILE and sent flying through the air
into the pool

Marco cringes at the sight (He’s still haunted by the
memory) Charlie fist pumps into the air in drunken approval

CHARLIE

So where are you two headed
MARCO

Palm Beach Well Miami
CHARLIE

Miami That’s a long drive
MARCO

Too long
CHARLIE

How long does a drive like that

take
MARCO

Not sure Mapquest clocks it at 3
to 4 days Knowing us though I’1l1
bank it at about a month

CHARLIE
Well I hope youre driving a nice
car at least

Marco makes a sour face A beat

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Just so you know about earlier I
was hitting on you I thought you
were cute

MARCO
(surprised)
But you said --

CHARLIE
-- What was I suppose to say Your
grandmother was right there I was
embarrassed

MARCO
(not knowing what else to

say)
Well thank you

Charlie suddenly grabs Marco’s face and KISSES him Marco is
thrown off at first then he kisses back They hold it for
a while After a moment he pushes her off

MARCO (CONTD)
(surprised at himself)

Wow so that’s how it feels to push

someone away It feels awful How

do you women live with yourselves

Charlie is embarrassed She gets up to leave

MARCO (CONTD)
(stopping her)
No wait I’m sorry I just can’t
Youre awfully attractive and very
very cool You make me a little
weak in the knees to be honest
(Charlie smirks)
But I’m sort of in a fragile place
right now

CHARLIE
I was under the impression that you
were on the rebound

MARCO
Not exactly Her and I are still
talking

CHARLIE

Talking But she’s in New York

MARCO
I know

Charlie thinks is over for a moment

CHARLIE
Long distance huh I tried that
once

MARCO

How did it go

CHARLIE
How do you think

Marco nods knowingly Charlie feels bad

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Sorry I’m sure you’ve heard enough
horror stories that I don’t have to
pack on mine

MARCO
Statistics aren’t good I know
that

Marco drops his head Charlie notices this and quickly heads
inside the house She reappears holding a bottle of JOHNNY
WALKER She shakes it playfully

CHARLIE
Ya know this still doesn’t mean
that I can’t get you drunk enough
to make some less than commendable
decisions

Marco sees her grins widely

MARCO
(sarcastically)
Oh because what a crime it would be
to be taken advantage of by you

Charlie passes the bottle to Marco He stares at it
reluctantly then shrugs his shoulders as if to say “what
the hell” and pounds one back

INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY

The room is quiet Morning light seeps through the blinds On
the bed sleeps Guita alone After a while she STIRS

She looks over the other side of the bed and notices no one’s
there She sits up confused She scans the room and sees
nothing Suddenly she notices the bathroom door is closed

Slowly she rises out of bed She walks sleepily toward the
bathroom She opens the door and is immediately taken aback
Her eyes are peeled open as she stares at -- MARCO LYING NUDE
ON THE FLOOR COVERED IN LIPSTICK TASSELS ON HIS NIPPLES
PENIS DRAWN ONTO HIS CHEST AND FACE LIP MARKS ON HIS ASS
AND AND A BOTTLE OF JOHNNY WALKER WHERE HIS DICK SHOULD BE

Guita stares blankly at him lying on the floor
GUITA

He rubs his head trying to dispel his massive headache

Guita breaks the silence

GUITA
Que bonita

Marco turns to look and sees it’s a CEMETERY

MARCO
Guita it’s a cemetery

GUITA
Death is a beautiful thing I
myself cannot wait

Marco is too hung over to humor her right now

MARCO
Can I please trust you not to say
anything to mom about last night

GUITA
(without turning)
Alina worries so much already
without any reason to So I don’t
plan on giving her one

Marco sighs with relief

MARCO
Thank you

GUITA
But the least you could do is tell
what happened

MARCO
It’s honestly difficult to remember
right now

GUITA
How did it happen

MARCO
I ran into our waitress from last
night She invited me

GUITA
(surprised)
Our waitress La muchacha that
didn’t like you

Marco knows where this is going He lets her have it

MARCO

GUITA
(proudly)
I know what I saw A woman can
tell

Marco complies He gets up and places the laptop on the
counter He looks at himself in the mirror He’s clearly
not used to this sort of thing He drops his pants Serene
watches amused Marco awkwardly reaches into his underwear
when -- GUITA’S YELLS FROM OUTSIDE THE DOOR

GUITA (VO)
What are you doing in there

Marco quickly pulls his hands out of his pants and snatches
up the laptop to cover the screen

MARCO
Nada It’s fine I’m just going to
the bathroom

GUITA (VO)
Well hurry up I have to pee pee

Marco winces at the sounds of “pee pee” He flops back down
on the toilet embarrassed He stares back at Serene

MARCO
Yeah that weirded me out
(looks at his pants)
I think I lost it

Serene smiles seductively

SERENE
You sure about that

On the screen she stands up and seductively starts to TAKE
OFF HER PANTS Marco raises an eyebrow

She drops her pants to reveal she’s wearing a nice THONG
Marco grows giddy

Her hands move toward her shirt Marco is glued to the
screen She slowly starts to raise her shirt about to reveal
her breast -- a phone RINGS

Marco mouth hangs open in anticipation Serene stops She
looks around for something The phone continues ringing
Marco panics he looks for the sound too Serene moves away
from the screen and returns with her cellphone Marco watches
her talk on the phone devastated

SERENE (CONTD)
Hey Tyler What Tonight Maroon
5 after party Of course I want to
go Where Okay Okay Ya come

She hangs up Marco is trying to understand what’s happening

MARCO
What was that

SERENE
Oh sorry honey but a friend of
mine from work invited me to a
party Maroon 5 is having after a
show they just did in Soho

Marco is in absolute dismay he watches Serene go to the
closet and pull out some clothes

MARCO
Who’s Tyler

Serene mood instantly changes She returns to the screen

SERENE
Oh Marco please don’t start okay
He’s just a friend from work
Anyway I don’t want to have this
conversation right now

Marco realizes he hit a nerve

MARCO
I’m sorry I just -- We were doing
this and he calls you and you just
drop it

SERENE

It’s a Maroon 5 after party
Wouldn’t you want to go I haven’t
had any real fun since I got here

MARCO
Well she needs help I mean

At that moment Guita exits the motel room She makes her way
toward Marco

MARCO (CONTD)
Alright well we got to go

ALINA
I love you Bye

Marco hangs up then goes around the car to open the door for

Guita

GUITA
Who was that

MARCO
Mami Did you want to talk to her

GUITA
God no I don’t have the energy to
talk that woman right now It’s
exhausting

Marco shrugs

INT OLDSMOBILE - DAY

Marco steps inside and closes the door

He starts

MARCO
Okay we are already officially
behind schedule We need to make up
for yesterday

GUITA
(studying Marco)
You look terrible Did you get any
sleep

MARCO
Not really

the car

GUITA
I slept like a baby I adore motel
beds It’s like sleeping on a
cloud

Marco doesn’t respond He starts the car and is about to pull
out into the street when A BIKER CROSSES RIGHT IN FRONT OF
HIM He SLAMS on the brakes Marco and Guita jolt back The

biker stops give Marco the finger and rides on

GUITA (CONTD)
You have to be more careful Marco
You can hurt somebody

INT OLDSMOBILE - DAY

INSERT TITLE CARD
DAY 3

Marco drives listening as Guita tells one of her many
stories The windows are down as the hot air blows through
their hair

GUITA

He was the worst the absolute
worst Sometimes he would go to
court and he wouldn’t even know who
he was defending The poor people
he defended would be on trial with
an attorney who didn’t read his
file or even know who he was Luis
my brother would say

(in spanish)
Your problems didn’t start until
you got to Mr Lopez’s office

Guita laughs Marco is too tired to laugh

MARCO
Wow

GUITA
Can we roll up the windows The
wind is ruining my hair

MARCO
It’s keeping me awake

GUITA
Why are you so tired Didn’t you
sleep at all

MARCO
I couldn’t
GUITA
Porque
Marco hesitates
MARCO

No reason Forget it

GUITA
Tell me

Marco thinks it over for a moment then speaks with absolute
seriousness

MARCO
You snore Guita You snore worse
than anyone I’ve ever heard It’s
actually a miracle that a sound
like that can come out of a woman
like you

Guita acts stunned then starts to LAUGH

GUITA
Aye dios mio I’m sorry I can’t
help it

MARCO

I know but it’s terrifying I’s in
actual fear for my life

Guita laughs HARDER Marco becomes amused with the reaction
this is receiving He keeps going

MARCO (CONTD)

It sounded like a crying giraffe
(more laughs)

People no longer need to go to the

wilderness in search of

adventure one night with you

would scare them straight

Guita is in tears now She can hardly breathe Marco can’t
help but smile

GUITA
(through laughter)
You know I think that’s why Mr
Lopez had an affair

Marco is taken aback by this information

MARCO
That’s ridiculous

GUITA
(becoming serious)
He said he couldn’t stand it
anymore That I was insufferable
We barely slept in the same bed for
years

She stops laughing She becomes sad Marco looks at her
sympathetic

MARCO
Guita I very much doubt Mr Lopez
cheated on you because you snore
(MORE)

MARCO (CONTD)
If you loved someone you wouldnt
even mind if they farted all night
in their sleep

GUITA
I did that too

MARCO
It doesn’t matter Guita it wasn’t
your fault Mr Lopez is just a
douchebag

GUITA
(confused)
Que What’s that

MARCO
Ya know an asshole a dick
Whatever
GUITA
(getting it)
Ahh My favorite is
(thick accent)
Cocksucker
The sound of the word gets Marco to laugh The mood lightens
up

GUITA

MOMENTS LATER

Marco is still on the phone as he spots Guita headings his
way

MARCO

INT OLDSMOBILE - DAY

Marco and Guita drive again in silence Something is clearly
on Marco’s mind

MARCO
Fine but if I tell you then you
have to promise not to tell mom
GUITA
(crosses her heart)
I swear on my life I know it’s not
much but it’s all I have

Marco takes a deep breath

MARCO
I’m going not going back home right

New York
Guita nods impressed

GUITA
Brave

MARCO
You don’t think it’s crazy and
stupid

GUITA
What’s love if not crazy and
stupid

Marco is still clearly nervous

GUITA (CONTD)
Look at it this way Before you
leave before you get on the plane
before you do anything you
already have the “no” That “no” is
with you no matter what So if you
go who knows You might get a
“maybe” or possibly even a
“yes” So what do you have to
lose

Marco thinks it over He slowly becomes reassured

MARCO
Yeah youre right

GUITA
Claro

A SIREN sounds from behind Marco looks at the rearview
mirror and sees RED AND BLUE LIGHTS

MARCO
What the hell now I wasn’t
speeding

They pulls over to the breakdown lane Marco looks around
trying to see if he did anything wrong Guita remains still
Her eyes drift to the side-view mirror She sees something
A GAS HOSE is sticking out of the tank

GUITA
I know what the problem is Mida

Marco curiously follows her gaze to the side-view mirror
MARCO
Shit I had no idea that was a
crime

A HIGHWAY PATROL CAR is parked behind the Oldmobile An
attractive female STATE TROOPER exits the car She walks
over
INT OLDSMOBILE - DAY
Marco squirms nervously Guita reclines her seat exhausted
and unmoved The car has an old fashion knob to roll down the
windows Marco grabs it and starts to roll it down -- it
JAMS
MARCO
Give me a fucking break The
windows jammed
Guita exhales void of any surprise Marco tries again it
doesn’t budge
EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The Trooper sees the door open It immediately sends her into
threat mode She DRAWS HER GUN and cowers beside the car

INT OLDSMOBILE - DAY

Marco hears the Trooper’s voice turns around His face goes
white once he sees the Trooper’s gun drawn He FREEZES

Guita realizes something’s wrong

GUITA
What now

Guita turns to look Her face goes white as well She turns
back around and stares blankly out the front window

GUITA (CONTD)
What did you do

MARCO
Nothing Just sit still and maybe
she won’t shoot us

GUITA
(honestly)
If I could only so lucky

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The Trooper inches towards the driver’s side with her gun
pointed at the door

TROOPER
Sir do not get out of the car or I
will shoot

A muffled voice seeps from inside the car She moves closer

TROOPER (CONTD)
What

The voice becomes clear

MARCO
(from inside)
The window is stuck I can’t roll
it down

The Trooper exhales puts her gun down

TROOPER
Sir you cannot open the door on a
officer It appears as a possible
threat

She moves next to the door

TROOPER (CONTD)
Okay now you can open the do--

The door SWINGS OPEN The Trooper is caught off guard she
reacts -- A GUNSHOT The window SHATTERS

EXT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The front doors burst open and Marco and Guita exit looking
ragged and exhausted as if they’ve just interrogated for
hours

GUITA
(frustrated)
That cocksucker I had to go to the
bathroom for three hours and she
kept telling me to “Stay right
there” I practically shit myself

MARCO
I thought she was kind of hot

Guita halts to take her bearings She can hardly stand

GUITA
I think I’m going to faint

MARCO
You just need to lie down

Marco notices it’s dark out

MARCO (CONT’D)
Well there goes another day

Suddenly Guita FARTS Marco looks both shocked and
disgusted

MARCO (CONTD)
Guita

GUITA
(not caring)
Don’t look at me like that I’ve
been holding that in for hours

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Marco exits the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his
waist as he brushes his teeth Guita lies motionless on the
bed -- she could be dead Marco talks through the brushing

MARCO
You know if it weren’t for New York
Id say we just turn around right
now

GUITA
(silently)
I second that proposal

Marco goes back into the bathroom spits A moment passes He
reappears dressed for bed

MARCO
It’s only been three days I’m
afraid what will happen if we keep
going

GUITA
Hopefully I’11 die

Marco shakes his head He suddenly gets down on his hands and
knees He starts doing push-ups Guita hears his pacing and
stirs

GUITA (CONTD)
What are you doing

He speaks through reps

MARCO
Working out
(breath)
I’ve gotten a little out of shape
since
(breath)
I haven’t done much at all
(breath)
except to mope

GUITA
Trust me papi that won’t matter

Marco flips over onto his back does crunches Guita flops
back down

MARCO
It can’t hurt

Marco does a couple more until he can’t any longer He gets
up and climbs into bed

MARCO (CONT’D)
You know I’ve never been to New
York before

GUITA
I have Many years ago
MARCO
How was it
GUITA
Cold
MARCO
(disappointed)
That’s it
GUITA

That’s all I remember

MARCO
(shakes head)
Very helpful thanks

They lie in silence for awhile
GUITA

So what makes this girl so special
Why must you have her

MARCO
You make it sound like a soap
opera

GUITA

Life is a soap opera
Marco takes a moment to answer the question

MARCO
(reflecting)

I don’t know to be honest
(MORE)
MARCO (CONTD)
I suppose it’s because she was the
closest I’ve ever had to a
girlfriend

GUITA
You never had a girlfriend
Imposible

MARCO
It’s true

GUITA
Oye

Guita becomes intrigued she gets up

GUITA (CONTD)
See that’s where you and me how do
you say differ I’ve had many
many boyfriends

MARCO
I think I’m just picky

GUITA
I’m not I like them all It’s like
an new illusion I’m always

tricked by the mirage

MARCO
Youre just fickle

GUITA
All women are I just fall in love
very easy Then my life is over I
can’t think about anything else It
consumes me

MARCO
I believe you’ve fallen in lust a
couple times maybe but not love

GUITA
I don’t see the difference Love
lust -- they’re the same At my age
Ill take either

Marco chuckles

GUITA (CONTD)
So keep going the girl

MARCO
Well she’s beautiful Never wore
make-up

GUITA
Natural

MARCO

Yes She’s sweet but only if she
likes you You have to earn it

She might be obnoxious at times but
she’s just speaking her mind She
knows who she is and I respect
that

Guita listens intently Marco becomes lost in thought

MARCO (CONT’D)
She was just that person that you
meet and you say “If I had her I’d
be fine I’d never need anything
else for the rest of my life
Having her would make everything
just okay”

Marco stops A beat

GUITA
Youre in love with her

He thinks it over for a moment

MARCO
Yeah I think so

GUITA
Well then that’s that Youre
doomed Like me

MARCO
I had her and was happy Am I just
suppose to let that go

Guita lies back down moments from entering that peaceful
slumber

Who knows

Guita falls asleep Marco reacher over to the cabinet drawer
opens it pulls out a pair of earplugs and puts them into
his ears He snuggles into the covers smiling

MARCO

as he plays on his phone

-- Guita hurries inside a Carl’s Jr and rushes to the
bathroom Marco is in the car and slumps into his seat as he

or two

Alina gets out of the car She’s stands in the parking lot of
a Fleming’s She’s wearing a beautiful dress and heels She
walks toward the restaurant

MARCO
I’m parked outside a church right
now You think it’s a sin to go to
church only to use the bathroom

ALINA
I don’t know Probably

MARCO
Do you and Guita always have to be
so honest

ALINA
Would you rather I sugarcoat
everything for you and have you not
learn how the real world works
Some parents may do that but not
me

She stops outside the front door of the restaurant

ALINA (CONTD)
Okay I got to go

MARCO
Yeah where to Big date

surprise

follows behind enamored with every little in-necessity she
comes across Right now it’s a “heated cushion”

Guita puts down the cushion and look at Marco intrigued

GUITA
You don’t say

MARCO

Guita chuckles

GUITA
I feel sorry for the man

MARCO
(confused)
Why

GUITA
It doesn’t matter Before long he
will see and disappear

MARCO
(defensive)
That’s harsh Give her a chance

GUITA
I would love to papi but your
mother is a lost cause I’ve given
up hope

Guita suddenly spots a ridiculous looking straw hat She runs
over and examines it

MARCO
She’s not perfect but I wouldn’t
go so far as saying she’s a lost
cause

GUITA
Marco she’s 50 and single she
doesn’t make a lot of money she
doesn’t clean she’s always has
anxiety always worrying the
woman is too desperate

Marco is upset He opens his mouth to say more but then sees
something

MARCO
Aha

He races over to a shelf of adult diapers grabs one that
say’s “Depends”

MARCO (CONTD)
Here we go No more stopping for
Ms Daisy here

Guita comes over holding a neck pillow and a handsize mist
sprayer

GUITA

GUITA
(duh)
Absolutely

INT CAR - NIGHT
Marco drives quietly Guita lies asleep with her new neck
pillow They cruise down a shopping center landscape

Something catches Marco’s eye

Outside a small restaurant a sign hangs that reads “Little
Habana”

He turns to look at Guita who’s starting her buzzsaw snoring
He makes a turn

INT MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Marco sits on the toilet naked talking to Serene via webcam

with his LAPTOP resting on his lap hiding his privates On
his LAPTOP SCREEN is Serene wearing only her underwear

LAPTOP SCREEN - SERENE IN HER APARTMENT

Serene unclips her bra lets it fall to the floor exposing
her breast

Marco eyes light up

MARCO
(under his breath)
I love skype

His hand falls to the touchpad He starts snapping pictures
of Serene’s boobs

SERENE
(sensing something)
What are you doing

Marco suddenly stops taking pictures

MARCO
Nothing

SERENE
Are you taking pictures or
something because that’s not okay

MARCO
(shaking his head)
No babe I promise

Serene starts to put her shirt back on

MARCO (CONTD)
No Don’t stop I was loving this

SERENE

MARCO
(crestfallen)
How am I suppose to sleep now You

SERENE
(smiling)
Oh I’m sure you can think of a way

She CLICKS OFF and the SCREEN GOES BLACK

Marco sits quietly wondering what to do next Then he clicks
the keyboard finds the pictures of Serene’s breast Eyes on
the screen he digs into his pants

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Guita lies in bed as she watches a WWII special of Adolf
Hitler giving a charismatic speech on the HISTORY CHANNEL

Marco exits from the bathroom in his boxers He walks over to
a suitcase on the floor and pulls out some clothes

GUITA
(eyes on the tv)
You know Hitler was kind of a
handsome man He had such charisma
I think if I knew him I would have
liked him The man was a genius
MARCO
(pulling on a pair of
pants)
The man was insane

GUITA
Maybe but I still like him

MARCO
(shaking his head in
frustration)
Well please just keep the Hitler
love confessions to yourself I
think our life is hard enough
without you being a nazi

She turns to Marco notices he’s putting on a nice

shirt

GUITA
(confused)
Where are you going

MARCO
(stressed out)
Lets get out of here Don’t you
want to spend some time somewhere

GUITA
(stretches out)
On the contrary this is my
paradise

MARCO

Come on Guita I saw a Cuban
restaurant on the way here It’s
close by Why don’t we go

GUITA
You expect me to get out of bed
and go out Youre crazy Id
prefer to get on another plane

MARCO
(begging)
Please Guita lets not allow this
trip to be completely miserable
Lets have some fun

She hesitates

GUITA
I can’t move Marco

dress

MARCO
I’m sure you’ve survived worse

She thinks it over

GUITA
Well I have been married

INT LITTLE HABANA - NIGHT

A small sized Cuban style restaurant Bright colors Cuban
music The place is crowded

Marco and Guita sit at a small table beside an empty DANCE
FLOOR Marco scans the place Guita is dressed in a cashmere
sweater pants and covered with jewelry -- a look that would
have worked thirty years ago maybe She has her pocket-mirror
out as she rubs on lipstick although she has more than
enough makeup on already

The WAITER arrives A tall dark Rico suave type He wears a
name tag that reads “MAURICIO” Guita looks at him and
quickly puts away her pocket-mirror

Mauricio speaks with a Cuban accent

MAURICIO
Hola Beinvenidos a Little Habana
May I take your order

Guita stares intensely at Mauricio for a long while like a
lioness in heat Marco watches amused Finally Guita picks
up her menu and opens it She orders in Spanish

GUITA
(in Spanish subtitles)
Yes can I have the shredded flank
steak with tomato sauce please and
a margarita

Mauricio puts down his pen

MAURICIO
(in Spanish’ subtitles)
What part of Cuba are you from I
know a Cuban when I hear one

Guita giggles giddily Marco watches as Guita flirts with the
waiter speaking rapidly and fluently in their native tongue
Mauricio turns to him smiling He holds up his pen and
paper

MAURICIO (CONTD)
(in Spanish subtitles)
What will you have sir

Marco grows nervous takes a deep breath

MARCO
Yo poder ordinar La

He pauses struggling to find the words

MARCO (CONTD)
Steak Medium please

Mauricio is thrown by the sudden shift in language

MARCO (CONTD)
With rice and beans too please Oh
and a Corona for me Thank you

MAURICIO
(confused)
Of course sir

Mauricio leaves Guita watches him closely as he walks away
After he’s out of sight she turns to Marco

GUITA
Why don’t you speak more Spanish I
know you can do it

MARCO
(shrugs )
I don’t know I’m embarrassed

GUITA
What is there to be embarrassed of
(makes a strong fist)
You should be proud

MARCO
When I speak it doesn’t sound
right I sound like a gringo

GUITA
That’s why you must practice

MARCO
Ahh maybe I’m too late to really
learn

GUITA

No dice eso meirda
(clarifies)
That’s bullshit

Beat

GUITA (CONTD)
You know what they call someone who
only speaks one language

MARCO
What

GUITA
American

A long pause Marco takes his napkin places it in his lap
Guita takes a look around the room After a while she
notices something

GUITA (CONTD)
Look

Puzzled Marco looks at her She hints him to looks across
the restaurant he follows her gaze

Near the dark corner of the restaurant sit an OLDER COUPLE
mid 50s They hold each other’s face in their hands kissing -
- The only people in the room

MARCO
Wow I’ve never seen a couple that
age so in love

GUITA
You want to know why not
(beat)
Look at his finger See anything

Marco looks The man is wearing a WEDDING RING

MARCO
Yeah so
GUITA
Now look at her
He looks at the woman -- No ring
MARCO
(gets it)

Ohhh
GUITA
After enough years no two people
are so passionate anymore

MARCO
So what youre saying that loves
fades Two people can’t stay in
love forever

GUITA
Precisely

Marco is clearly troubled by the thought

MARCO
That’s a bitter thing to say

GUITA
Bitter Yes Wrong No You don’t
know because youre too young but
after time I mean years long long
years they are no longer your
companion but your enemy Your
worst enemy

MARCO
(growing angry)
You maybe I doubt everyone

GUITA
(firm)
Everyone

At that moment Mauricio returns with the refreshments

gives Guita her margarita first

MAURICIO
(in Spanish subtitles)
Here is your margarita

GUITA
(hard stare)
Muchisimas gracias
Then gives Marco his Corona
MAURICIO
(in English)

And here is your corona sir

Marco nods thanks Mauricio departs

He

GUITA
(raises her glass)
How about a toast

MARCO
To what

GUITA
Whatever Youre smart Think of
something

Marco ponders for a moment then lifts his glass

MARCO
(raises glass)
To love

Guita hesitates She thinks it over for a moment then

GUITA
To heartbreak

Marco rolls his eyes They clink glasses

INT LITTLE HABANA - HOURS LATER

Marco and Guita are in the middle of a conversation Both are
significantly tipsy

GUITA

How come you and Eric never visit
me anymore

(reminiscing)
You two used to come over every
weekend and the moment you stepped
into the house you would demand to
go to the beach I remember I used
to watch as you two nearly gave me
a heart attack because you used to
swim so far out where I could
hardly see you You two we’re
always so adventurous

Marco is so drunk can hardly sit up he takes a moment to
gather himself

MARCO
I don’t know what to say Guita
It’s just that after me and Eric
moved out we’ve kind of become
preoccupied We’re not kids
anymore

GUITA
(waving it off)
Of course I know that You two
have your own lives and
responsibilities It’s fine
(hiding back tears)
I just miss my grandsons is all

Marco suddenly feels bad

MARCO
I’m sorry

GUITA
(becomes serious)
Hey What did I say

MARCO
(reiterating)
“Love means never having to say
youre sorry”

GUITA
Exactly

Suddenly there’s an eruption of SALSA MUSIC Marco and Guita
watch as people get up and make their way to the dance floor

Marco turns to Guita

MARCO
Want to dance

She laughs as it were the most preposterous question ever
asked

GUITA
Chico no Es loco
He pleads
MARCO
Come on dance with me
GUITA
I can hardly move I’11 fall right
over
MARCO

You’re not that old

GUITA
Im older

Marco stands up holds out his hand Guita stares at it
reluctantly

Unable to deny him any longer she takes it

DANCE FLOOR

The dance floor is crowded with couples both young and old
However by a mere glimpse one could mistake them for
professionals tossing and turning each other effortlessly

Marco and Guita find an empty spot and lock hands They move
slowly and clumsily at first then after a while they get
into a grove Marco takes the lead and begins to twirl her

GUITA
(amazed)
I didn’t know you can salsa

MARCO
Oh I’ve picked up a little here and
there
GUITA
Why didn’t you ever tell me
MARCO
Because I thought it’d be better to

show you

They continue to dance He spins Guita again

INT LITTLE HABANA - LATER
They return to their table sweating Marco signals Mauricio

MAURICIO
Yes sir

MARCO
Two waters please

Mauricio WINKS at Marco

MAURICIO
Of course sir

Marco hardly registers this shrugs it off Guita suddenly
places a hand over Mauricios’

GUITA
(in spanish subtitles)
With a lot of ice please

She winks at him He departs bewildered

MARCO
Very smooth Guita

GUITA
Que

MARCO

Don’t forget to wipe your mouth
from all that drool okay

GUITA
(innocently)
I don’t know what it is youre
talking bout

MARCO
Guita youre lusting over that
waiter like a sixteen year-old
catholic school girl

GUITA
Oh no when I was in Catholic
school is was much worse Trust me

Marco makes a sour face at the thought

Mauricio returns with the two waters he sets them down then
leaves Guita kisses her fingers like a chef after he’s just
prepared a meal Marco shakes his head A beat

GUITA (CONTD)
What are you going to do when you
get home

MARCO
Try to get my life back together I
guess Nothing much else to do
Find a job Finish school Stay
focused

GUITA
You never know maybe losing your
job was a blessing in disguise

MARCO
Funny Youre the second person to
say that to me

(MORE)
MARCO (CONTD)
Oh wait the first one said a star
in disguise Very touching

GUITA
Who knows Maybe something better
is waiting for you Maybe you’1ll
get a better job maybe you’ll move
to New York with that girl
maybe it’s fate

MARCO
Oh please Guita don’t do that
Don’t say it’s up to fate That “if
it’s meant to be it’ll be”

GUITA
Why not Maybe it is

MARCO

(angry)
It’s not alright Fate is just an
excuse People like to use fate so
they can justify and forgive
themselves for not doing something
that they didn’t want to do
Instead of having things turn out
the way the should have they say
“Its because it wasn’t meant to
be” Well that’s bullshit

Guita notices this has hit a nerve in Marco

GUITA
Let me tell you a story

He groans not wanting to hear another story

something
He sighs lifts his head

seemingly pointless story

MAURICIO walks into the bathroom takes the urinal next to

He turns to Mauricio who’s STARING DOWN INTO MARCO’S
URINAL Then WINKS at him The same familiar wink from
before

Marco quickly and hurriedly shakes zips up and shuffles
out

INT LITTLE HABANA - NIGHT

great idea Fantastic food

She looks over at Mauricio as he grabs a pitcher of water

GUITA (CONTD)
And marvelous artwork Tonight
was due to a perfection

Marco forces a grin Mauricio returns with the pitcher of
water Guita gazes dreamily at Mauricio as he pours her water
yet all the while oblivious to his simultaneous seductive
grinning at Marco until Mauricio inadvertently POURS THE
PITCHER INTO HER LAP

Guita SCREAMS leaping out of her seat

The scream jolts Mauricio out of his hypnotic gaze Then
beings his wave of over-sympathetic apologies

MAURICIO
Perdéneme Lo siento I’m sorry
I’m so sorry ma’am

Guita suddenly becomes serious
GUITA

I hate quando people call me
“ma’am”

MAURICIO
(freaking out)
I’m so so so sorry Perdéneme por
favor

Guita turns to Marco and motions for the door

GUITA
Vamanos

Marco jumps up

MARCO
Good idea
(to Mauricio)

Mauricio fumbles nervously for the checkbook He takes it
out offers it to Marco with a pen

Or for you ma’am
The pen FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND RIGHT INTO GUITA’S EYE

GUITA
(holds a hand over her
eye)

he’s doing -- STOPS Then out of nowhere he LAUGHS He
starts reeling The severity of the situation quickly begins
to dissipate

EXT LITTLE HABANA - NIGHT

Marco and Guita exit the restaurant while Guita holds
drunkenly onto Marco arm She wears a bandage taped over her
eye

from every direction festooning the house with it’s flowers
stems and roots all the while odd exotic statues decorate
the porch

Marco and Guita stand on the porch Marco takes a long deep
breath not wanting to do this more than anything in the
world Guita is again covered in make-up trying her hardest
to look her best

Guita rings the doorbell

friends I remember I used to
help her bathe you and Eric in the

Ida goes inside Marco and Guita follow

INT IDA’S HOUSE - DAY

Throughout the guided tour in the house Guita and Ida and
Guita speak faster than their lips can move in Spanish The
inside of the home is even more bizarre than the outside The
same exotic statues ornaments fill the house depicting
bizarre sexual positions every piece of furniture is painted
and decorated with bright colors all the walls are painted
with Frida-style drawings with eyes that follow you around
and also O’Keefe-esque nude figures with voluptuous bodies
surrounded with flowers

Marco and Guita carefully watch each step as it seems that
whatever they come near could be shattered at the slightest
touch

Marco ultimately notices something even far more bizarre On
the walls hang photos of a woman looking similar to Ida but
about two hundred pounds heavier obese

English

MARCO
Weren’t you together for like
twenty-five years

Ida replies in English

IDA
Longer

MARCO
So what happened

IDA
Nada Nothing happened I wasn’t in
love with him anymore

Marco gives her a hopeless devastated look Ida notices this
and elaborates

IDA (CONTD)
We were painters We painted this
entire house together A couple
years ago he stopped for no
reason He just wasn’t the same man
anymore We used to have so much in
common but now all we want to do
is cut each other’s throats The
man was not very good to me either
Do you know what he did when we
first met

Marco nods

IDA (CONTD)
Well then you know

Marco presses on speaking partially out loud but most to
himself

MARCO
All women cannot be this heartless

Ida laughs

IDA
Ask your Guita After what we’ve
been through its a miracle we have
any heart left at all

Guita gives an enthusiastic nod

MARCO
I wonder why Mom turned out so
different She must never been as
torn apart as the two of you

Ida laughs

IDA
Are you kidding I still thank god
to this day that I never had to
experience what your mom went
through

Guita suddenly snaps at her

GUITA

(getting the courage)
Serene Hi

Serene is still clearly upset

SERENE
I’m surprised you have the balls to
call me

MARCO

I know I just can’t get it off my
mind about how much of an idiot I
was Can you talk

SERENE

fashion show of the year but I’ve
told you that like three times
already

MARCO
I’m sorry I’m sorry I didn’t
listen I don’t ever listen You
were right I was completely
immature and you deserve better

SERENE

MARCO
No wait let me finish Babe I
think what you and me have doesn’t
happen everyday I’ve never met a
girl like you before someone who
could make me want to pull my hair
out and give me butterflies at the
same time -- but it’s okay That’s
what I love about you To me your

want in anybody

Guita smiled wide overwhelmed with emotion
GUITA
(tears forming in her
eyes)

evacuating the building We have to
