FADE INTO
EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

Vast empty and calm Its a beautiful sunny day Just then
the wind starts to pick up kicking the waves into a froth

AT THE HORIZON
The sky darkens
CLOUDS

Big malevolent ones A bolt of lightning SNAPS from one to
another The air boils

THE OCEAN

Has turned slate gray and ominous Wind driven waves churn
across the surface Its the birth’ of a storm a big one

CUT TO
EXT SOUTH CAROLINA BEACH SUNSET

Gentle waves lap at a beautiful white sana beach A MAN
suddenly RISES out of the surf dressed in wet suit and scuba
gear Carrying a spear gun and a net full of fish

An OLD COUPLE and a gaggle of KIDS gather around to admire
the fish while the Scuba Man kicks off his €ins

BEYOND THE BEACH

A green Chevy station wagon beater vith Louisiana plates is
parked in the trees The scuba diver drops his f£ish and
starts to climb out of his scuba gear

Off come the tanks the mask and wet suit hood The scuba man
is blond and square-javed built like a line backer

Looking around to make sure he ts unseen he pulls something
from a zippered pouch in his wet suit its a length of
baling wire and a couple of miniature detonators

Now he leans into the car and pulis a tarp off a bulky
rectangular item hidden behind the seats revealing a
sophisticated ship to shore radio He Carefully hides the
wire and the blasters picks up the mike and hits the
transmitter switch

table Is set
He shuts down the radio
EXT BEACH - A SHORT TIME LATER
The Scuba Man drives along the coast road Stops at a point
overlooking the local marina a sma)l cove harboring a few
hundred boats separated from the ocean by a long wharf
AT THE END OF THE DOCK

A huge luxury YACHT sits at anchor seventy feet long and
gleaming white The kind Aristotle Onassis would have

Scuba Man puts high powered binoculars to his eyes Focuses
on the yacht

THROUGH THE LENS

A party is in progress a vell dressed crowd sipping
cocktails and eating food served by liveried black men

Scuba Man pans the marina

FURTHER UP THE DOCK

muscular and blue-eyed handsome in his mid-tventies with a
small shark tatooed on his bicep

‘gates Hauls sails to a dockside shed locking them up

SCUBA MAN

Lowers the binoculars puts the car into gear and drives
Off

at the yacht stopping for moment to watch the party a
pretty blond WOMAN approaches tanned and sexy carrying her
red high-heeled pumps

CUT TO
INT MARINA COMPOUND - LATE NIGHT
Willie sleeps under a thin blanket A vomans laughter floats
over the lullaby of waves against the pier Then something

a moment listening to the night He glances at the Clock
315 He gets out of bed crosses to the window and raises
the blinds
THE YACHT

The party 1s over Two people sit on the aft feet dangling
over the side Its too dark to see who
but their voices reach him Hes about to lover the blinds
when something catches his eye

END OF THE DOCK

A movement in the darkness Could be a man heading silently
for the yacht Maybe two or three The yacht people are
oblivious sharing a laugh

Willie quickly pulls on some pants

EXT MARINA

Willie walks warily along the dock carrying a crowbar every
sense alert A CREAKING behind him makes him whirl around

He is face to face vith a MAN Gressed head to foot ina
black wet suit The Man whips out his knife grabs for
Willie and tries to slice him

WILLIE

Reacts instantly blocking the blow Counters with a
lightening combination of his own an elbow to the mans gut
and a knee in the nuts

Bullseye Wet Suit goes down hard

Running footsteps along the dock Three more MEN materialize
out of the darkness all dressed in black wet suits al
Carrying automatic weapons Willie is surrounded

ist Wet Suit gets to his feet Dravs a 45 from his wet
suit

SECOND WET SUIT
No gunshots Use your knife

FIRST WET SUIT
Fuck it

Willie flicks them a look trying to get a glimpse of their
faces as the man levels the pistol at him Suddenly the
yacht engine ROARS to life The Wet Suits look off

WILLIE

KICKS the gun from Wet Suits hand BURSTS past the men and
throws himself into the water
THE WETSUITS

Let go with a volley raking the water They turn and run up
the dock where the yacht is already pulling away 1st Wet
Suit picks up his gun fires one more volley into the water
then runs off himself

THE RAIDERS

Hop into a couple of rubber assault rafts and FIRE up the
engines

WILLIE

Surfaces amid the pilings Scrambles up onto the dock

THE YACHT

Steams out of the marina flanked by the rafts There is a
SCREAM as the two yachts people are tossed off the stern
and flounder in the water

WILLIE

Races along the dock

KABOOOOQOOOOMMMM An explosion rips the night Willie is
HURLED backward A burst of Orange flame shoots high into the
sky The decimated dock seals off the marina

The sky rains debris WHAM Something hits Willie The worla
goes black

Churning from the force of the explosion Two bodies float
face down Its the blond WOMAN and her companion

CUT TO
INT GEORGE GAGES STORE

George Gage surfaces to consciousness still tied to the
canoe

He twists around trying to get a look at his rawhide bonds
He gives them a yank Winces Gives them another tug They
dont give

He goes into a frenzy pulling bucking straining to bust
free They just cut into his skin He lies back catching his
breath

He cranes his neck over the gunwales The knife case is just
a few feet away He swings his feet over tipping the canoe
Hes momentarily stunned at how deep and cold the water is

He quickly recovers dragging the canoe to the knife case
SMASHES it with his foot Kicks all the glass out of the way
and leans his face into the case Clamps a knife between his
teeth and gingerly pulis it out of its sheath

Twists back straining upward with his hands trying to close
the synapse between the blade and his bonds

He opens his mouth dropping the knife into his hand The
point pierces his palm drawing blood He wraps his fingers
around the blade slicing them to ribbons -

Oblivious he gets control of the handle and cuts through
the rawhide Hes springs from the canoe shoving it out of
the way

A wave of pain shoots through his head He squeezes his eyes
shut rubbing his temples Blood trickles down his face

Startled he looks into his hand The blood flows freely from
his lacerated fingers He washes his hand in the floodwater

and rips off a piece of cloth from the display case Ties it
around his hand

Grabs his shotgun and a box of shells Storms out the door

CUT TO

collar down the middle of his back

He lifts the sack and heads out the door

moving up ahead He starts to run but cant move very fast
the water is getting deeper

HIS POV

Whatever he saw has now vanished Just the uprooted tree
rises in the middle of the £looded street

George shoulders his shotgun and studies a demolished store
front A big plece of window boarding dangles groaning in
the wind George rips it off and tosses it into the water
where it bobs and floats

Now he whips out his knife cuts a limb off the tree and

pares it down He slides onto the floating board and using
the tree limb pushes off

a tarpaulin covers a mound of equipment Willie pulls it
back Underneath is the scuba gear wet suit fins masks
oxygen tanks a pair of collapsible Grappling hooks anda

Willie paddles the raft to the sea vall
BEYOND

The ocean churns madly

IN THE SKY

Thick clouds have shut out the moon and the wind is steady
again

AT THE HORIZON

A beam of light shines in the blackness its the freighter
cruising the mouth of the bay

Willie navigates the raft to the sea wall Climbs out and
drags the raft after him Huge waves pound the wall almost
sucking Willie over

He whips off the tarpaulin and grabs the wet suit and pulls

it on Lifts the Oxygen tanks out kneeling to adjusting the
straps

Willie turns back to the oxygen tank A big wave crashes the
wall Willie glances back at George Hes gone

Willie drops the tank and runs along the wall frantically
searching for George

‘HIS POV

The ocean has him For a split second Georges terrified
face is visible before the sea sucks him under

No hesitation Willie jumps in after His powerful strokes

are useless The maelstrom tosses him between waves and
consumes him Now theyre both gone

The ocean boils crashing against the sea wall Still no sign
of them

Suddenly Willie bursts to the surface with George locked
under his arm But the ocean wont give up pulling them
under again But neither does Willie He thrashes to the
surface kicking furiously with his fins

This time he catches a wave and rides it to the vall He
pulls George out turns him over and sets to work reviving
him Blows into his mouth and jams on his chest Then does
it again

George twitches rolls over and vomits gasping for breath
Another wave nearly knocks them both over the wall

WILLIE
Youll be alright now Better get
outta here

Willie pats him on the back and goes back to work struggling
into the oxygen tank

George sits up and watches him expressionless

Willie tosses the raft into the surf and jumps in after The
little craft is nearly flipped but Willie manages to get the
twin Mercury engines into position They kick over witha
roar and Willie sets off disappearing into the black night

George struggles to his feet looking after Willie All the
fight has gone out of him Another wave nearly knocks him

flat He turns and moves along the sea wall towards the
