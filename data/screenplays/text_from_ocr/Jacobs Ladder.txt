JACOBS LADDER
by

Bruce Joel Rubin

EXT VIETNAM - DUSK

A swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army
of men over a Vietnamese hillside

The SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the
protection

of the jungle Falling into coulmns like strands of soldier ants
seventy-five men at combat readiness assemble on the edge of a
sweltering wilderness

It is dusk The mood is lazy soporific Members of one platoon huddle
close to the ground smoking a joint

JERRY
Strong stuff

ROD
(to JACOB a soldier
squatting several yards
away)
Hey Professor how many times can
you shit in an hour

GEORGE
Dont bug â€˜im

DOUG
Where are those gooks already

FRANK
Some offensive I dont even think
theyre out there

PAUL
Jesus this grass is something else

JACOB SINGER returns to the group pulling up his pants

ROD
Why even bother to pull em up
FRANK
You jackin off out there again huh
Jake

PAUL
Hey get off his back

ROD
Its called philosophizing right
Professor

JACOB gives them the finger

JACOB
Up yours you adolescent scum

Laughter

SERGEANT (VO)
Mount your bayonets

FRANK
(frightened)
Oh shit
PAUL
Goddam
ROD

Gimme that joint

JERRY
Hey somethings wrong

GEORGE
What is it

JERRY
My head

GEORGE

Its nerves Take another toke

GEORGE reaches out extending a joint Suddenly he gasps and falls to
the ground his body convulsing uncontrollably The others stand back
startled JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his
chattering teeth

ROD
Whats going on
Before anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head screaming He turns
frantically in all directions

JERRY
Help me Help me

PAUL
What the hell

In seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control his head shaking
into a terrific blur He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck
FRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs He
begins gasping and hyperventilating His eyes grow wide and frenzied
as

he gulps for air Fear and confusion sweep across his face The MEN
watch horrified as FRANKs terror escalates beyond reason into all-
out panic

Suddenly FRANK begins howling He lunges for his bayonet and without
warning attacks the MEN around him

PAUL
God Almighty

PAUL spins out of the way as FRANKs bayonet impales the ground JACOB
jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass PAUL
rushes

to his assistance

JACOB stares at FRANKs face as FRANK struggles beneath him It is the
face of a madman

PAUL
Good God Whats happening

The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting
behind them Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening
sky

ROD
Behind you Look out This is it

The MEN spin around PAUL panics and jumps to his feet leaving JACOB
alone with FRANK FRANKs eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers
his strength

JACOB
Dont leave me

Dark figures silhouetted by the setting sun are storming at them
SOLDIERS squint to see It is a horrifying vision
PAUL
Theyre coming

Gunfire explodes on all sides Suddenly PAUL flips out He begins
screaming uncontrollably ripping at his clothes and skin FRANK is
struggling like four men and JACOB is weakening in his effort to
restrain him Bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire Bodies fall
More bodies keep coming The first wave is upon them

ROD shoots into the air Shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like
banshees ROD squinting jabs with his bayonet piercing the belly of
his attacker Agonizing cries accompany his fall ROD yanks the
bayonet

out and stabs again

In the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and slams the
butt of his rifle into JACOBs back There is a cracking sound

JACOBs
eyes freeze with pain His hands rush for his spine As he spins
around
one of the ATTACKERS jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into
JACOBs stomach JACOB screams It is a loud and piercing wail

CUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a long dark
tunnel There is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a
brilliant light The rush suggests a passage between life and death
but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through
a SUBWAY STATION far below the city of NEW YORK

INT SUBWAY - NIGHT

THE WHEELS OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN screech through the station JACOB
SINGER sitting alone in the last car wakes up The sounds of the
scream and the grating wheels merge He is dazed and confused not
certain where he is

JACOB glances around the empty car His eyes gravitate to overhead
advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks
Gradually
his confusion subsides Shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book
out of his back pocket The Stranger by Albert Camus He begins
reading Another station blurs by

JACOB is a good-looking man of obvious intelligence He is in his
mid-
thirties It is surprising that he is wearing a mailmans uniform He
doesnt look like one

The subway ride seems to go on interminably JACOB is restless and
concerned He glances at his watch It is 330 AM Putting his book
in

his back pocket JACOB stands up and makes his way through the
deserted

car

INT SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT

JACOB enters the rumbling passageway between the cars The wheels
spark

against the rails The dark tunnel walls flash by He pulls the handle
on the door to the next car It is stuck He struggles with it A LADY
sitting alone inside turns to look at him She seems threatened by his
effort He motions for her to help She turns away

A look of disgust crosses JACOBs face He kicks the door It slides
open The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches her

JACOB

Excuse me do you know if weve
passed Nostrand Avenue yet

(she doesnt answer)
Excuse me

(she does not

acknowledge his

existence)
Look Im asking a simple question
Have we hit Nostrand Avenue I fell
asleep

WOMAN
(speaking with a Puerto
Rican accent)
I no from around here

JACOB
(glad for a response)
Yeah you and everyone else

JACOB walks to the other end of the car and sits down The only other
passenger is an OLD MAN lying asleep on the fiberglass bench
Occasionally his body shudders It is the only sign of life in him

The train begins to slow down JACOB peers out of the window Nostrand
Avenue signs appear He is relieved He gets up and grabs hold of the
overhead bar

The OLD MAN shudders and stretches out on the seat As he adjusts his
position tugging at his coat JACOB catches a brief glimpse of

something protruding from beneath the coats hem His eyes fixate on
the spot waiting for another look There is a slight movement and it
appears - a long red fleshy protuberance The sight of it sends
shivers up JACOBs spine It looks strangely like a tail Only the
stopping of the train breaks JACOBs stare

INT SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

JACOB is the only passenger getting off The doors close quickly
behind

him He glances at the LADY sitting by the window There is a fearful
expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark
tunnel out of his sight

JACOB reaches the exit a huge metal revolving door surrounded by
floor

to ceiling gates He is about to push when he notices a chain locking
it shut He stares at it in disbelief

JACOB
Goddam it

He turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform As he
approaches the far exit his eyes widen The gate there is also
locked

His hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation

CUT TO JACOB stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the
tracks A rat scampers by and he gasps

JACOB
No way

He starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere
else to go He juts out his jaw and steps back down

JACOB is not comfortable on the tracks He cannot see where he is
stepping His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace
The steel girders are coated in subway grime The oily substance coats
his hands as he reaches for support

JACOB
Goddam fucking city

He wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center
track He reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate Two
pinpoints of light hurl toward him Then the noise arrives confirming
his fear A train is bearing down on him JACOB looks frightened not
sure which way to go He steps forward up to his ankle in slime He
cannot tell which track the train is on It is moving at phenomenal
speed The station is spinning The trains lights merge into one
brilliant intensity
In near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train spins by Its
velocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end
He

clings to a pillar for support gasping in short breaths

A few PEOPLE are staring at JACOB from the train Their faces pressed
up against the glass seem deformed A lone figure waves at him from
the rear window The train bears them all away Then it is quiet
again

For a moment JACOB is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure
He continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the
ladder

to the UPTOWN PLATFORM

CUT TO

JACOB smiling The smile however is one of irony not amusement
This

exit too is locked A heavy chain is wrapped through the bars JACOB
stares at it with an expression of total bewilderment

A sudden muffled scream alerts JACOB that he is not alone His head
turns but sees no one He hears the scream again He senses its
direction and walks toward the MENS ROOM A crack of light appears
under the door He can hear someone moaning inside JACOB knocks
softly

and the moaning stops The lights click off

JACOB
Hey is someone in there

There is no answer JACOB stands silently for a moment not sure what
to do He can hear whispering He chews his lower lip nervously and
then reaches for the door It pushes open

The light from the station penetrates the darkness He gasps He sees
a

MAN tied naked to the stall with ANOTHER NAKED MAN grabbing quickly
for

his clothes The BOUND MAN screams

BOUND MAN
Fuck off Mind your own business

A THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows pointing a kinfe at JACOBs
throat

MAN
You cocksucker Get outta here

The MANs face is barely human Before JACOB can even react the door
slams shut The lock engages The crack of light reappears JACOB can
hear laughter coming from inside followed by a scream He backs away
from the door His face is white

JACOB turns with full fury and storms the gate The chain gives wayto
his anger It flies apart and the gate flings open He stands in
amazement observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and
drops to the concrete below The gate squeaks loudly as JACOB pushes
it

aside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut

EXT WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN

JACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC HOUSING
PROJECT It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic
structures JACOB passes through a vast COURTYARD dominated by the
imposing shapes Aside from his moving body everything is still

INT HALLWAY - DAWN

JACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal
hallway He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT

INT JACOBS APT - DAWN

JACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light He tries to
navigate his way to the BATHROOM illuminated by a tiny nightlight in
the distance His effort is unsuccessful He bangs loudly into a
table

A WOMANs voice calls out

JEZZIE (VO)
Jake is that you

JACOB
What the hell did you do move all
the furniture

JEZZIE (VO)
Why didnt you turn on the light

JACOB
I didnt want to wake you

JEZZIE (VO)
(sleepy but pleasant)
Gee thanks a lot

JACOB
Where is the lamp

JEZZIE (VO)
Where are you

JACOB
If I knew I wouldnt have to ask
What did you do I was happy the way
it was

JEZZIE (VO)
I moved the couch Thats all

JACOB
Where to

JACOB crashes into it A light suddenly goes on JEZEBEL JEZZIE
PIPKIN 33 is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a mans terrycloth
bathrobe around her waist Although sleepy disheveled and not
looking

her best it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman juicy and
sensual

JEZZIE
That help

JACOB
(nearly sprawled over
the couch)
Thanks

He pushes himself up

JEZZIE
What do you think

JACOB
What do you mean

JEZZIE
The room

JACOB
Oh God Jezzie ask me tomorrow

JEZZIE
It is tomorrow Four AM How come
youre so late

JACOB
Roberts didnt show up What could I
say Besides its double time
JEZZIE
(seeing the grease on
his uniform)
What happened to you

JACOB
(unbuttoning his shirt
as he walks to the
BATHROOM)
Dont ask

JACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes leaving them
in

a pile on the floor He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of
water pouding against the porcelain tub JEZZIE enjoys JACOBs
nakedness She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his
nipples His body tenses slightly JEZZIE drops her robe They enter
the shower together

EXT VIETNAM - NIGHT

A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water JACOB is

crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE His shirt is
bloodsoaked He moves slowly creeping on his right forearm His left

arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass

JACOB
Help me Someone

Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance It dances
around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB It is impossible to
see who is carrying it The light darts near the ground where JACOB is
lying and then bursts directly into his eyes

INT JACOBS APT - DAY

SUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window JACOB is sleeping fitfully
as a bar of light saturates his face His hand rushes up to cover and
protect his eyes but the damage is done He is awake

JACOB lies in bed for a few moments dazed Slowly his hand gropes
along the shelf at the head of the bed searching for his glasses He
has trouble finding them As his hand sweeps blindly across the
headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor He
sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-
focus

shelf behind him Suddenly JEZZIE enters

JEZZIE
You up

JACOB
No Have you seen my glasses

JEZZIE
(shaking her head)
Whered you leave em

JACOB
I dont know

JEZZIE
Did you look around the headboard

JACOB
(wearily)
Jezzie I cant see

JEZZIE
(she scans the shelf)
Maybe you left em in the bathroom

She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large

paper
bag She tosses them both onto the bed

JACOB
Thanks
(he puts on his glasses
and notices the bag)
Whats that

JEZZIE
Your kid dropped it off

JACOB
Who Jed
JEZZIE
(stooping to pick up the
phone)

No The little one

JACOB
Eli Why cant you remember their

JEZZIE

Theyre weird names

JACOB
Theyre Biblical They were prophets

JEZZIE
Well personally I never went for
church names

JACOB
And where do you think Jezebel comes
from

JEZZIE
I dont let anybody call me that

JACOB
(shaking his head)
Youre a real heathen you know that
Jezzie Jesus how did I ever get
involved with such a ninny

JEZZIE
You sold your soul remember Thats
what you told me

JACOB
Yeah but for what

JEZZIE
A good lay

JACOB
And look what I got

JEZZIE

JACOB
I must have been out of my head

JEZZIE

JACOB
(ignoring the criticism
and reaching for the
paper bag)
Whats in here

JEZZIE
Pictures Your wife was gonna toss
em so whats his name brought
over on his way to school

JACOB lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed There are
hundreds of them He examines them with growing delight

JACOB
Look at these will ya I dont
believe it Jesus these are
fantastic Look heres my Dad
And heres my brother when we were
down in Florida

JEZZIE
Lemme see

JACOB
(rummaging excitedly
through the pile)
Here Look This is me and Sarah when
I was still at City College

JEZZIE
(looking closely)
Thats Sarah
(she studies the photo)
I can see what you mean

JACOB
What

JEZZIE
Why you left

JACOB

What do you mean you can see

JEZZIE
Look at her face A real bitch

JACOB
She looked good then

JEZZIE
Not to me

JACOB
Well you didnt marry her

He digs through more photos Suddenly he stops

JEZZIE
Whats wrong

To JEZZIEs surprise and his own tears well up in his eyes For a
moment JACOB is unable to speak He just stares at one of the photos
JEZZIE looks at the picture It is an image of JACOB carrying a small
child on his shoulders

JEZZIE
Is that the one who died

JACOB
(nodding)
Gabe

JEZZIE is silent JACOB grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose

JACOB

(continuing)

Sorry it just took me by surprise I

didnt expect to see him this morning
God what I wouldnt He was

the cutest little guy Like an angel

you know He had this smile
(choking up again)

Fuck I dont even remember this

picture

Hiding his emotions JACOB scrambles over the bed and reaches for a
pair of pants He pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the
photo of GABE inside It joins photos of his two other boys JEZZIE
begins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag

JACOB
Wait Dont

JEZZIE
I dont like things that make you
cry

JACOB

I just want to look

He reaches into the pile for other snapshots We see an array of

frozen
moments happy unfocused obscure Suddenly he stops and stares at a

yellowing snapshot

JACOB
God this is me
(he holds up a baby
photo)
Look Its dated right after I was

born
(he stares at it
intently)
What a kid Cute huh So much
promise

JEZZIE surveys the scene

JEZZIE
Its amazing huh Jake Your whole
life right in front of you

(she pauses before

making her final

pronouncement)
What a mess

INT HALLWAY - DAY

JEZZIE carries the garbage to an INCINERATOR ROOM down the hall She
is

carrying several bags Two of them are tossed instantly down the
chute

She hesitates with the third After a moment she reaches into it and
pulls out a handful of photos They are pictures of JACOB and SARAH
With cool deliberation she drops them down the chute An apartment
door

slams shut Quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her
hand

JACOB opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the
memories of his life falls to the fire below

JACOB
Ready

JEZZIE
Just gettin rid of the garbage

JACOB and JEZZIE both wearing postal uniforms head for the ELEVATOR
They are surprised that it has arrived promptly JEZZIE reaches out
and

playfully sticks her tongue into JACOBs ear He pulls her into the
ELEVATOR They disappear laughing behind its closing doors

EXT NEW YORK CITY - DAY

JACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown
Manhattan As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al
Jolsons Sonny Boy

JACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th Street He
opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him He lifts
them with effort and slams the door with his foot It doesnt close
He
considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy He turns
instead and waddles toward the store

INT LAUNDRY - DAY

A heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a counter

cluttered
with laundry A picture of Richard Nixon is still stapled to the wall
She looks at JACOB

WOMAN
Where do you expect me to put those
I dont have any room

She tries clearing the counter but it doesnt help

WOMAN
(continuing)
How bout over there
(she points to a table)
No wait Do me a favor Bring em to
the back room

JACOB
Theyre awfully heavy

WOMAN
I know Thats why Im asking

JACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store CHINESE
LAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes Steam from the pressing
machines shoots into the air

JACOB
huffing and puffing)
Wheres Wong

WOMAN

Thats what Id like to know If you
see him on the street somewhere tell
him hes fired

JACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf There is a snapping sound
and he winces in pain Massaging his back JACOB unfolds some papers
for the WOMANs signature

JACOB
How was Palm Springs

WOMAN
Hot Where do I sign
JACOB
(pointing to the line)
You got a nice tan though

WOMAN
Tan What tan It faded on the
airplane Id try to get my money

(she looks heavenward)
Two hundred dollars a night for
what

She hands JACOB the wrong sheet

JACOB
No Ill take the other one
(he takes it)
Right Well its good to have you
back See you tomorrow probably

WOMAN
If youre lucky

JACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store He walks carefully
His
back is out

INT MAIL TRUCK - DAY

ANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic Nothing is moving Horns are
blaring and drivers are agitated JACOB reaches for a newspaper lying
on top of his mail bags To his shock one of the bags appears to move
Curious JACOB pokes at it Instantly a terrifying figure pops out
from

beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare JACOB jumps
back stunned It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at
an old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck The mans face is
covered in strange bumps

JACOB
Goddamn it What the hell
WINO
(pleading)

I didnt take nothin I was just
napping Dont hit me I was cold

JACOB
(lifting the man up)
What the hell do you think youre
doing You cant do this This is
government property

He begins opening the door The WINO begs

WINO
Dont throw me out Theyre gonna get
me Theyll tear me to pieces

He holds on to JACOBs leg JACOB tries to pull away

JACOB
Come on You cant stay here

WINO
Please I never hurt anybody when I
was alive Believe me I dont belong
here

JACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him from the
truck A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he
leads the WINO to the sidewalk JACOB pulls a dollar bill from his
pocket and places it in the WINOs hand The OLD MAN crumples it into
a

ball and turns away He has a frightened look on his face JACOB
returns to the truck shaking his head

JACOB
New York

He climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror He
notices the WINO edging fearfully along the side of a building A horn
honks and traffic begins moving When JACOB looks back the WINO is no
longer there

INT GARAGE - DAY

JACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE PARKING GARAGE
on

34th Street His mind seems distracted He has difficulty parking
INT POST OFFICE - DAY

We see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting and moving
mail

JACOB carrying a bag of McDonalds hamburgers walks stiffly through
the aisles his left hand rubbing his back Several workers greet him
and grab for his french fries He offers them around
ANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail A hand reaches in correcting
mistakes Suddenly a hamburger passes by JEZZIE looks up and smiles

JEZZIE
Jake

JACOB

She takes the hamburger and shrugs

JACOB
(continuing)

JACOB shrugs
JEZZIE
(continuing)

JACOB
Ill be glad to avoid the crush

JEZZIE
I enjoy crushing into you

She grabs him and hugs him tightly

JACOB
Gently My back

JEZZIE ignores him and squeezes again

INT CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY

CUT ON A SCREAM to JACOB in a CHIROPRACTORS OFFICE He is lying on a
long leather padded device that looks like an instrument of torture
LOUIS the Chiropractor is a giant of a man 280 pounds

adjusting JACOBs spine

LOUIS
Come on Jake That didnt hurt

JACOB
How do you know

LOUIS

I know you How come youre so tense

JACOB
What can I tell you

LOUIS

JACOB
Her knee acting up

A bit

JACOB
What did she have to say

LOUIS

(he turns on his left)
How about the other right
(JACOB turns back)

I dont understand you philosphers

Youve got the whole world figured

difference between right and left

JACOB

I was absent the day they taught that

LOUIS

JACOB

LOUIS

He makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on JACOBs thigh JACOB
groans

LOUIS
(continuing)
Ah good Now turn to your left

JACOB
She talk about the boys

LOUIS
She says she cant get them new coats
because you havent sent the alimony
for three months

JACOB
She told you that
(he shakes his head)
Did she tell you about the 2000 Im

LOUIS
She said you were a son of a bitch
and she regrets the day she set eyes

on you
JACOB
I thought you said she didnt say

She didnt Thats about all she
said Put your hand up Good I think

JACOB
She hates me Louis

LOUIS
You should go back to her

JACOB
What She threw me out remember She
wanted some professor to carry her
far away from Brooklyn Only we
didnt make it She cant forgive me
that she still lives in the same
house she grew up in

LOUIS
Her problem is that you spent eight
years getting a PhD and then went to
work for the post office

JACOB
What can I tell you Louis After Nam
I didnt want to think anymore I
decided my brain was too small an
organ to comprehend this chaos

LOUIS
(looking at JACOB with
affection)
If it was any other brain but yours
I might agree Relax this is going
to be strong

JACOB
I cant relax

LOUIS
Wiggle your toes

JACOB wiggles his toes At that instant LOUIS twists JACOBs neck
rapidly There is a loud cracking sound

EXT VIETNAM - NIGHT

THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT A MAN rushes at the camera yelling

MAN

He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos

CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
Suddenly LOUIS reappears a halo effect still visible behind his

JACOB
God almighty What did you do to me

LOUIS

adjustment Rest a moment and let it
set a bit

JACOB
I had this weird flash just then

LOUIS

subject)
You know you look like an angel

JACOB

LOUIS

EXT BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING

JACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue

imitating Al Jolson

He hums

JACOB
When there are gray skies I dont
mind the gray skies as long as
theres you

It is near dusk and lights are just coming on The shop

head

He is singing to himself and
windows have a particularly garish look about them The mannequins are
dressed in inexpensive almost tawdry clothes and have a pathetic
appearance A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations

The ornamentation seems strangely out of place almost blasphemous

JACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug
store They chortle and make taunting sounds

GIRL
(shaking her tits
singing)
Hey Mr Postman
JACOB stops and stares at them To their surprise he begins to sing
with them He knows the words They like that It is a sweet moment

JACOB continues walking He comes to a cross street The light is
green He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR
sharging around the corner The car is moving at full speed heading
straight toward him A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out

YOUNG MAN
Look out

JACOB turns and sees the car He scoots out of the way but it swerves
in his direction The YOUNG MAN calls out again

YOUNG MAN
Jump

With a huge thrust JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car
shoots

by Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat They are laughing
like madmen and shaking their heads They do not look human JACOB
yells and waves his fist to no effect After a moment he turns to
thank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him but he is gone

INT JACOBS APT - DUSK

JACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed They are a sensual couple and even
in quiet reflective moments such as this their positioning is erotic
and stimulating Both of them are nude JACOBs hands are clasped
behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling JEZZIE is
lying on her side her left leg draped across JACOBs pelvis Her head
is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet
scar on JACOBs stomach Neither are talking Suddenly out of the
blue JEZZIE speaks

JEZZIE
Maybe its all the pressure Jake
The money Things like that Or your
wife

JACOB
Why do you bring her up

JEZZIE
Cause shes always on your mind

JACOB
When was the last time I said a word

JEZZIE
It has nothin to do with talkin

She pauses for a while long enough to suppose that the conversation
is
over Then she continues

JEZZIE
(continuing)
Or maybe its the war

JACOB closes his eyes

JEZZIE

(continuing)
Its still there Jake

(she points to his

brain)
Even if you never say a word about
it You cant spend two years in
Vietnam

JACOB
(annoyed)
What does that have to do with
anything Does it explain the
barricaded subway stations Does it
explain those Godforsaken creatures

JEZZIE
New York is filled with creatures
Everywhere And lots of stations are
closed

JACOB
Theyre like demons Jez

JEZZIE
Demons Jake Come on Theyre winos
and bag ladies Low life Thats all
they are The streets are crawling
with em Dont make em into
somethin theyre not

(she rubs his forehead)
Its the pressure honey Thats all
it is

JACOB
Those guys tried to kill me tonight
They were aiming right at me

JEZZIE
Kids on a joy ride Happens all the
time

JACOB

They werent human

JEZZIE
Come on What were they Jake

JACOB doesnt answer He turns over on his stomach JEZZIE stares at
his naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks Scratch
marks follow in their wake

JEZZIE
You still love me

He does not respond

INT JACOBS KITCHEN - DAY

JACOB and JEZZIE are sitting at the breakfast table JEZZIE is reading
the National Enquirer and chewing at her lip Suddenly a drop of blood
forms and falls onto the formica table top Staring at it fora
moment

she wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue

JACOB is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the
housing project across the way The toaster pops JEZZIE jumps She
gets up butters her toast and returns to her paper

JEZZIE
Says here the worlds comin to an
end The battle of heaven and hell
they call it Should be quite a show
fireworks H-bombs and everything
You believe them Jake

JACOB doesnt answer
JEZZIE
(continuing)

Me neither God look at this Two
heads Only lived two days A day for
each head Could you imagine me with
two heads Wed probably keep each
other up all night - arguing and
whatnot You wanna see the picture

He does not respond JEZZIE gets up and walks over to JACOB Standing
in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart She
is naked underneath it Sensuously she leans forward unbuttons his
shirt and strokes his chest She waits for a response from him but
there is none He sits silently disinterested

Furious JEZZIE turns away Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom
closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on Breasts flash
from beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the
floor

JEZZIE
(continuing)
Goddamn you son-of-a-bitch My
uncles dogs used to treat me better
than you do At least theyd lick my
toes once in a while At least they
showed some fucking interest

A NEIGHBOR bangs on the wall shouting

JEZZIE
All right All right All right

JACOB peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the
patterns of early morning movement Tiny figures drift purposefully
over the concrete

Suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off In the silence JACOB realizes
that JEZZIE is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen

table He walks to her side and strokes her hair JEZZIE begins to
sob

After a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes

JEZZIE
You love me

He nods his head yes She smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a
kitten against his crotch After a few moments she speaks

JEZZIE
(continuing)
Dellas partys tonight Why dont we
go Itll take your minf offa things
And I wont make you dance I
promise Huh

(he nods his head in

consent JEZZIE hugs

him)
You still love me Jake

He nods his head again only heavily as though the question exhausts
him

INT BELLVUE HOSPITAL - DAY

JACOB is in the Mental Health Clinic at BELLVUE HOSPITAL walking
through the PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM It is overflowing with people
Some are handcuffed to their chairs POLICEMEN are with them JACOB
approaches the main RECEPTION DESK He speaks nervously

JACOB

She shrugs and looks at a log book

before coming back over to JACOB

RECEPTIONIST

JACOB

JACOB pounds the desk rattling a tiny African violet and knocking the
RECEPTIONISTs forms to the floor She grunts angrily and stoops to
retrieve them Standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off
TWO KNUCKLE-LIKE HORNS protrude from her skull where the cap had been
JACOBs eyes lock on them like radar He backs away She immediately
replaces her cap and breaks the spell but her eyes glare at him with
demonic intensity JACOB freaked angry turns and runs toward the
In

Patient door

RECEPTIONIST
Hey You cant go in there

JACOB doesnt stop A POLICEMAN guarding the entrance runs after
him
JACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution
A LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS all holding hands is moving down the hall
They break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream Their ATTENDANT
tries to calm them down but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their
hysteria They grab hold of him as he tries to get by

POLICEMAN
LET GO GET AWAY

INT GROUP ROOM - DAY

JACOB dashes out of view He runs down another corridor wildly
searching for a specific room He finds it and rushes inside He is
surprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN seated in a circle They
all

look up at him

LEADER
Can I help you

JACOB
Im looking for Dr Carlson Isnt
this his office

The LEADER stares at him uncomfortably After a moment he gets up and
takes JACOB into a corner of the room Everyone is watching them The
LEADER speaks quietly

LEADER
Im so sorry Obviously you havent
Dr Carlson died

JACOB
(stunned)
Died
LEADER
A car accident
JACOB
Jesus Jesus When
LEADER

Last month before Thanksgiving

JACOB
How did it happen

LEADER
No one knows They say it blew up
JACOB
(growing pale)
Blew up What do you mean it blew up

The LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB but he pulls
away

LEADER
Do you want me to get someone

JACOB
No No Its okay Im okay

He backs quickly to the door As he turns to leave he realizes that
all

of the PEOPLE in the group are watching him intently

Unsettled JACOB hurries back into the hallway He is frightened and
confused Suddenly a voice calls out

POLICEMAN
HEY YOU MATLMAN

JACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him His gun is drawn

POLICEMAN
Hold it Just hold it Where the hell
do you think you are This is
Bellevue for Gods sake People
running around here get shot

The GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions to the
POLICEMAN

LEADER
Its alright Hes okay

POLICEMAN
(nodding reholstering
his gun)
Come on get out of here I wouldnt
want to interfere with the US Mail

He leads JACOB toward the lobby JACOB does not look back

INT DELLAS APT - NIGHT

WE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE JACOB is with some
POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment A DRUNK
is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same
time It is constantly on the verge of spilling JACOB is fixated on
it In the background we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB
to

join her He nods no The DRUNK who keeps asking people if they get
it takes JACOBs head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps
trying

to re-explain the joke

JACOB hears a strange noise and looks around It seems to be coming
from a covered bird cage He goes over to it and lifts the cover The
BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out The sound
loud and insistent startles him He lowers the cover

In the DINING ROOM several people are gathered around ELSA an
attractive black woman who is reading palms She sees JACOB and calls
over the music

ELSA
Hey you Let me look at your hand

JACOB shrugs DELLA dancing nearby calls out

DELLA
Go on Jake She reads em like a
book
JACOB
No thanks
DELLA
Its fun

CUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOBS HAND ELSA is squeezing the mounds and
examining the lines What begins as a playful expression on her face
turns suddenly serious She reaches for his other hand and compares
the

two of them JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene
jealously

ELSA
You have an unusual hand

JACOB
I could have told you that

ELSA
You see this line here Its your
life line Heres where you were
born And this is where you got
married Youre a married man huh
Oh oh Nope Divorce See this split
She studies his life line with growing concern JEZZIE tries to get
JACOBs attention He ignores her

ELSA
(continuing)
You know you got a strange line
here
JACOB

(examining it)
Its short huh

ELSA
Short Its ended

JACOB
(laughing)
Oh terrific
ELSA

Its not funny According to this
youre already dead

JACOB
(smiling)
Just my luck

CUT TO

THE DANCERS Their movements are loose and getting looser The music
is

strong and insistent The smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and
gives them a strange distorted appearance Suddenly JEZZIE breaks
from

the crowd and reaches for JACOB He pulls away Some of the MALE
DANCERS call out to him

DANCERS
Come on man show your stuff

JACOB is easily intimidated Relenting he glares at JEZZIE and nods
apologetically to ELSA It is obvious that he is embarrassed at his
inadequacy on the dance floor

MAN
Come on professor You got feet too

JACOB tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing JEZZIE is
playing with him mimicking his movement A number of DANCERS notice
and laugh which only increases his discomfort JEZZIEs taunting has
a

strange effect on JACOB He grows distant and withdrawn even though
his body is still going through the motions of the dance

A MAN taps JEZZIE on the shoulder She spins around smiling and
begins dancing with him JACOB is left alone dancing by himself He
looks away uncomfortable

In the shadows a WOMAN kneels close to the floor She seems to be
urinating on the carpet JACOB is shocked Several DANCERS obscure his
view He turns around

A PREGNANT WOMAN stands half naked in the kitchen JACOB cannot
believe
what he sees

In the next room past JEZZIE JACOB glimpses a terrifying image a
MAN

whose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has
lost all definition Something about the image compels and frightens
JACOB Slowly he approaches it As he draws nearer to it the tortured
image lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that JACOB
backs away

A WOMAN laughing grabs JACOB spins him around and begins dancing
with him He is totally disoriented

WOMAN
Hold me baby

She takes JACOBs arm and guides it to her back THE CAMERA follows
his

hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy loose fitting
dress He runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades Then suddenly
he recoils Her back is a mass of shoulder blades hundreds of
strange

bony protrusions JACOB gasps Out of the blue JEZZIE leans into him
and wiggles her tongue in his ear JACOB startled jerks his head and
his glasses go flying to the floor

JACOB
Shit

He stoops down blindly to pick them up Shoes just miss his fingers as
he digs between dancing legs trying to recover them Miraculously he
grabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back
on Instantly his world comes back into focus

As he stands JACOB is surprised to find JEZZIE facing him gyrating
in

wild abandon There is a huge satisfied smile on her face She grabs
his hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is
dancing to her own rhythm JACOB stares at her confused It takes him
a moment to realize that her smile is not for him
Standing behind JEZZIE is another DANCER his hands around her waist
They are moving together locked in erotic embrace It appears that he
is mounting her from behind Looking down we see that the DANCERs
feet

are deformed They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very
much

like hooves They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet

Something horrible and winglike flaps behind JEZZIEs back We cannot
make out what it is but it elicits a primal terror Before JACOB can
react JEZZIE opens her mouth With a roaring sound a spiked horn
erupts from her throat It juts menacingly from between her teeth and
thrusts into the air A CIRCLE OF DANCERS scream out in excited
approval

CUT TO JACOBs face as it registers terror and disbelief He stares at
the DANCERS who are crowding around him They have become perverse
corrupt aspects of their normal selves

JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from his head
but it wont go away The music throbs His actions become spastic
almost delirious

JACOB is out of control His frenzy becomes a kind of exorcism a
desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind WE MOVE
IN ON HIM as his eyes pass beyond pain The dark walls of the
APARTMENT

fade away

EXT VIETNAM - NIGHT

Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness outlined by
a

bright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud The faces are
looking

down and voices are speaking

VOICE
Hes burning up

VOICE
Total delirium

VOICE
Thats some gash His guts keep
spilling out

VOICE
Push em back
JACOB (VO)
Help me

His eyes focus on the moon Rings of light emenate from it filling the
sky with their sparkling brilliance The rings draw us forward with a
quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed The rush
causes them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling almost
sensual surge of color The display is spectacular and compelling

Music can be heard in the distance growing hard and insistent like a
heart beat Heavy breathing accompanies the sound The stroboscopic
flashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light The
music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo Then silence

INT DELLAS APT - NIGHT

The APARTMENT reappears in all its normalcy The neon sign is still
flashing outside the window DANCERS are smiling and sweating

Cheers and applause ring out for JACOB and JEZZIE but JACOB barely
hears them JEZZIE hugs him tightly PEOPLE smack him on the back

ADMIRER
You are out of your mind man Out of
your fuckin mind

WOMAN
Jake you little devil You never
told me you could dance like that

MAN
Jezzie what did you put in his
drink

JEZZIE smiles while pulling JACOB to a corner chair He plops down
His

chest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach Hie face is
frightened and distorted

JEZZIE
You okay

JACOB
I wanna leave Get me out of here

JEZZIE
Oh come on Its early

JACOB
(pulling JEZZIE close to
him his voice filled
with paranoia)
Where are we

JEZZIE
(surprised by the
question)

JACOB

JEZZIE
What do you mean Where do you think

JACOB
Wheres Della Bring her here

JEZZIE

JACOB

JEZZIE
(confused)

JACOB eyes her with a pleading look Annoyed JEZZIE leaves JACOB and
crosses the room He watches her as she goes JACOB is holding his
stomach and rocking painfully Moments later JEZZIE returns with
DELLA

DELLA

DELLA
(feeling the
strangeness)

JACOB

JACOB is shaking uncontrollably

DELLA

and cheeks)

JEZZIE
(continuing)
Cant you stop it

JACOB

If I could stop it Id stop it

WOMAN

DELLA

ELSA

Let me help you

She reaches out to JACOB Unexpectedly he recoils
like a wild man He begins to scream

JACOB
Stay away from me Dont you come
near me All of you Go to hell Go
to hell goddamn you Stay away

Suddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking His
entire body is convulsive

People are gathering around

jumping to his feet

JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a confused and embarrassed look A MAN
whispers to her
MAN
Ill call a cab

INT JACOBS APT - NIGHT

JACOB is lying in bed in his own BEDROOM with a thermometer in his
mouth JEZZIE is pacing the floor with great agitation

JEZZIE
Ive never been so mortified in my

The NEIGHBOR pounds on the wall

JEZZIE
(continuing)
All right All right

JEZZIE jabs her finger at the wall

JEZZIE
(continuing)
If you go crazy on me youre goin
crazy by yourself You understand

JEZZIE reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer She looks
at it closely and then squints to see it better

JACOB
Whats it say A hundred and two

JEZZIE
I dont believe this Im calling the
doctor

She runs out of the room JACOB calls after her

JACOB
What does it say

JEZZIE (VO)
Its gone to the top

JACOB
How high is that

JEZZIE (VO)
The numbers stop at 107

JEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room

JACOB begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket at the
foot of the bed He pulls it up around his shoulders The whole bed
vibrates with his shivering Suddenly JEZZIE rushes through the
BEDROOM

and into the BATHROOM SHe turns on the bath water

JACOB
What the hell are you doin

JEZZIE
Get your clothes off

JACOB
What are you talking about Im
freezing

JEZZIE
Get your clothes off

JACOB gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the KITCHEN

JACOB
Whatd the doctor say

JEZZIE (VO)
That youd die on the way to the
hospital Now get into that tub

JACOB stares at her as she bursts back into the BEDROOM carrying four
trays of ice cubes She hurries into the BATHROOM and dumps them in
the

tub

JEZZIE (VO)
Hes coming right over

JACOB
Coming here

JEZZIE (VO)
Goddamn it Get in here I cant
stand around waiting
She rushes out of the BATHROOM and pulls JACOB out of bed He is
shaking violently and she has difficulty navigating across the room
and

undressing him at the same time She maneuvers him into the BATHROOM
next to the tub He looks down at the ice cubes floating in the water

JACOB
Youre out of your mind Im not
getting in there Id rather die

JEZZIE
Thats your decision

JACOB
Look at me Im ice cold

JEZZIE
Youre red hot damn it Get in
there Ive got to get more ice

She runs out of the room The door to the apartment slams shut JACOB
sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out again instantly

JACOB
Oh Jesus

He sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice cold water
turns his foot bright red He keeps it in as long as he can and then
yanks it out quickly wrapping it in a towel JACOB rubs his foot
vigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water afraid of
its pain

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

JEZZIE is running up and down the CORRIDOR knocking on doors and
collecting ice cubes from those who will answer She hurries back to
the BATHROOM with several PEOPLE behind her carrying additional ice
trays One of the MEN is shifting the trays in his hands to avoid the
burning cold

INT JACOBS BATHROOM

As JEZZIE enters the BATHROOM JACOB is sitting on the rim of the tub
with the water up to his calves shivering vigorously

JACOB
I cant do it

JEZZIE
What kind of man are you
She unloads two trays into the water

JACOB

The TWO MEN struggle with JACOB and force him into the water TONY

JACOB

INT A BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before He is tossing
and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out Suddenly he
sits up and looks over at the window It is open and the shade is
flapping Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering

JACOB
Damn You and your fresh air

He jumps out of bed and goes over to the window He pushes at the
frame

and it comes flying down with a loud bang A woman in the bed sits up
It is SARAH

SARAH
What was that

JACOB
Its freezing

SARAH
Im not cold

JACOB
Of course not You have all the
blankets It must be ten degrees in

that window is closed

SARAH
Its not healthy with it closed

JACOB
This is healthy Ill probably die of
pneumonia tomorrow and this is

He settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side
He

lies quietly for a moment thinking

JACOB
(continuing)

What a dream I was having

living with another woman

I was
You

SARAH
I dont want to know

JACOB
Jezebel from the post office You
remember you met her that time at
the Christmas party I was living
with her God it was a nightmare
There were all these demons and I was
on fire Only I was burning from ice

SARAH
Guilty thoughts See what happens
when you cheat on me even in your

mind
JACOB
She was good in bed though
SARAH
Go to sleep
JACOB
She had these real beefy thighs
Delicious
SARAH
I thought you said it was a
nightmare

Suddenly out of nowhere
YOUNG BOY enters the room
He

is wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles We recognize him

we hear the tinkling sound of a music box
carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms

from his photograph It is GABE
GABE
Daddy what was that noise
JACOB
(surprised to see him)
Gabe
(he stares curiously at
his son)
What are you doing

She starts to rise JACOB stops her and gets up instead He whisks
GABE
upside down and carries him into his

GABES BEDROOM - NIGHT

BEDROOM licking his belly and tickling him all the way GABE laughs
and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed JED 9 and
ELI 7 are both in bunk beds across the room JED looks up

JED

(he kisses GABE and goes
over to JED in the lower
bunk)

He hugs him warmly and then walks to the door

GABE

There is deep emotion and seriousness in GABEs words JACOB is struck
by them

GABE
(continuing)
Dont shut the door
JACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar

GABE
(continuing)
A bit more a bit more

JACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him secure
GABE smiles and cuddles in his bed

INT SARAHS BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACOB settles back into bed SARAH turns over and gets comfortable
JACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling He pulls the blankets up to
his neck He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing

JACOB
I love you Sarah

She smiles warmly His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is
back
asleep

EXT VIETNAM - PRE DAWN

WE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS CRICKETS and BIRDS The image of trees
materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky just before sunrise
can be seen through the branches It is an idyllic setting

Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance a metallic
humming growing louder There is a scramble of feet and a sound of
heavy boots moving through the tall grass Voices can be heard Mens
voices

VOICE
Theyre here

VOICE
Thank God Move em out

VOICES
Bust your balls

VOICE
Move it Move it

There is an instant swell of activity Trees and branches blur and
speed by overhead The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself
as a POV SHOT The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a
huge CLEARING

High overhead a helicopter appears Its blades whirl with a deafening
whine Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air SOLDIERS
leap up into the air reaching for them The air is filled with

turbulence Tarps fly off dead bodies SOLDIERS hold them down Voices
yell but the words are not clear They are filled with urgency

The CAMERA leaves the ground The edges of the sky disappear as the
helicopters gray mass fills the frame It grows larger and darker as
the CAMERA approaches Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly
come

into view Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning out of control
Hands emerge from inside reaching out to grab it

Watery womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere the rippling of water a
heart beating Gradually voices can be heard mumbling distant sounds
warm and familiar

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

JACOBs DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub Surprisingly
JEZZIE and MRS CARMICHAEL are standing there too JACOB stares at
them

in total confusion

DOCTOR
You are a lucky man my friend A
lucky man You must have friends in
high places thats all I can say

SAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR They are extending their hands
to the POV CAMERA JACOBS arms nearly blue reach out to them

Slowly they lift him from the icy water JACOB takes one step onto the
tile and collapses to the floor

CUT TO BLACK

INT JACOBS BEDROOM - DAY

FADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet A glass rattles on
a tray A television is on low in the background Slowly the CAMERA
LENS opens from JACOBs POV and we see JEZZIE puttering around the
BEDROOM Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her She smiles

JEZZIE
Jake
(she places her hand on
his head and strokes his
hair)
Youre gonna be all right Jake
Youre gonna be fine

JACOB
Am I home
JEZZIE leaves the room

and confused

JEZZIE

Youre here Home The doctor said
youre lucky your brains didnt boil

(she smiles)
What a night Jake It was crazy You
kept sayin Sarah close the
window over and over And talkin
to your kids Even the dead one
Weird You know you melted 200 pounds
of ice in 8 hours Amazing huh

JACOB
Are we in Brooklyn

JEZZIE

Youre right here Jake You just
rest

(she puffs up his

pillow)
The doctor said you had a virus
Thats what they say when they dont
know what it is You cant do
anything for a week He says you
gotta recuperate

(she strokes his

forehead and gets up)
Now you just lie here Mrs Sandelman
made you some chicken soup Itll
warm you up

INT JACOBS KITCHEN - DAY

JACOB watches her as she goes

He seems lost

JACOB unshaven wearing his bathrobe is sitting at the KITCHEN

TABLE

PILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out before him He studies

them

to distraction

JEZZIE is standing by the counter making sandwiches

She wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box another

in the refrigerator

JEZZIE
You know you really ought to get out
today You cant just sit around like
this all the time Its not healthy
Its not good for your mind Go take
a walk or somethin Go to a movie
Christ whos gonna know You think I

She is dressed in her postal uniform

yourself One of us should be having
a good time

(JEZZIE knocks on

JACOBs head)
Hello Anybody home

(she looks in his ear)
Anybody in there

JACOB
What

JEZZIE just stares at him She does not respond JACOB returns to his
books

CUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS real demons with spindly
horns and long tails JACOBs huge finger magnified scans page after
page of ancient images and archaic text JEZZIE enraged at his lack
of

attention returns to packing her lunch box Suddenly she spins
around

JEZZIE
Goddamn it I cant stand it anymore
Ive had it up to here Go ahead and
rot if you want You son-of-a-
bitch Im talking to you

CUT BACK to the DEMONS Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOBs
attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head He looks up to see
JEZZIE

knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly
across the room The noise is terrible The intensity of her rage is
shocking The pots crash into every surface knocking all his books
onto the floor And then suddenly she stops

JEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich stuffs it
back in its plastic Baggie and puts it back in her lunch box She is
about to leave when she stops and looks at JACOB

JEZZIE

(continuing her anger

in check)
I made you a tuna fish sandwich Its
in the fridge Eat a carrot with it
The aspirins on the bottom shelf
Were out of soap so if for some
reason you decide to wash yourself
again use the dishwashing stuff

(she walks out of the

room and returns with

her coat)
Im sorry I yelled but you get on my
nerves

(she bends down and

makes eye contact with

JACOB)
Hello Listen I gotta go

the booth JACOB follows him with his eyes but does not go after him
A

YOUNG MAN in the next booth observes the scene with interest He looks
vaguely familiar like we have seen him before

PAUL stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the
juke

box He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot
His

finger pushes a selection at random Some 60s rock hit blares out
JACOBs mind is reeling by the time PAUL sits back down

PAUL
(continuing)

body The booth begins to rattle

PEOPLE at the bar look over in their direction

JACOB

all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently
JACOBs eyes peer to the left

INFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below A pair of
MEDICS are huddled over him A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends
a

stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield The
PILOT unable to see clears it away with his hands

his ear close to JACOB to hear

JACOB
Help me

consumes the car The air is filled with flames and flying debris The
YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar

exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor

JACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box from the
closet The box is filled with yellowing army papers dog tags and
photos of old comrades Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet

INT JACOBS APT - NIGHT

JACOB swallows hard as he stands there holding the letter Suddenly
his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted
on the bedroom door Something in the mirror like the image of a
child seems to move He looks over There is nothing there Curious
JACOB walks toward the mirror As his image appears he gasps and
stops
moving To his horror and ours it is his own back that is reflected
in
the mirror The impossibility of the moment startles him He lifts his
hand The reflection moves with him Frightened but defiant JACOB
moves toward the mirror The image in the mirror spins around It is
the FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE he saw at the party with JEZZIE An
unearthly scream comes from both their mouths

JACOB
NO

mayonnaise squirt onto GEARYs shoe JACOB turns away

for a man who cant keep his mouth
shut

JACOB
Who are you What do you want

Men drown that way The army was
another part of your life Forget it
It is dead and buried Let it lie

ARMY OFFICIAL 2

Singer

JACOB stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk
Letting out a howl he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman He
is totally out of control

With a wild leap he grabs for the door handle The door flies open

It

flaps back and forth slamming into parked cars JACOB tries to jump

out but the men yank him back in One of them pulls out a gun JACOB
sees it and goes crazy His feet kick in all directions slamming the
DRIVERs nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window

The car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor
The men dive for it It lodges beneath the seat In the mayhem JACOB
throws himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement
People look down at him as the car speeds away

EXT BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON

JACOB grabs his back He is in excruciating pain He tries to get up
but cant move He reaches out to people passing by but they ignore

The RESIDENT ignores him JACOB screams

RESIDENT
I dont have to ask if you can feel
that

JACOB

Goddamn it I want Louis

NURSE
Whos Louis
RESIDENT
Hes out of it Im taking him down

to X-ray

An ORDERLY pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors JACOB
tries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized

INT CORRIDORS - NIGHT

JACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of
corridors The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity
The smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement The ORDERLYs feet
plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices
along

the way The surface grows rougher the wheels more insistent Body
parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves
faster

JACOB
Where are you taking me Where am I

ORDERLY
You know where you are

JACOB panicked tries again to get up but to no effect He glances to
the side and sees mournful CREATURES being led into dark rooms No one
fights or struggles We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors
Occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in
strange contraptions people in rusty iron lungs and hanging from
metal cages Dark eyes peer out in horror In one room a baseboard
heater bursts into flame No one seems concerned A door opens A
bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and
mangled One of its wheels is still spinning JACOB cries out but it
is

not his voice we hear Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar His
whole body stiffens As he rounds the corner he sees a figure its
head

vibrating in endless terror it is the same image he has seen before
JACOB screams

INT ROOM - NIGHT

JACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM A numer of DOCTORS are waiting
As

they draw closer JACOB notices that something about them is not right
They bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like DEMONS creatures of
another world JACOB tries to sit up but winces in pain He cannot
move He tries to scream but no sound comes out

Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling They are lowered and
attached
with speed and efficiency to JACOBs arms and legs He screams

JACOB
Oh God

The DOCTORS laugh There is the sound of a huge door closing JACOB
is left in semi-darkness Suddenly a new group of DOCTORS emerges
from the shadows They are carrying sharp surgical instruments They
surround JACOB their eyes glistening as bright as their blades JACOB
is panting and sweating in fear One of the DOCTORS leans over
JACOB

He gasps with horror It is JEZZIE

JACOB
JEZZIE

She pays no attention to him He stares at her THE CAMERA TILTING
DOWN

HER BODY As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass
swarming

with maggots The DOCTORS laugh They take great pleasure in his
suffering Their voices are strange and not human Each utterance
contains a multitude of contradictory tones sincere and
compassionate

taunting and mocking at the same time The confusion of meanings is a
torment of its own

JACOB
(continuing)
Get me out of here

DOCTOR
Where do you want to go

JACOB
Take me home

DOCTOR
Home
(they all laugh)
This is your home Youre dead

JACOB
Dead No I just hurt my back Im
not dead

DOCTOR

What are you then

JACOB

DOCTOR
Then what are you doing here

JACOB
dont know I dont know
(he struggles like an
animal)
This isnt happening

DOCTOR
What isnt happening

JACOB
Let me out of here

DOCTOR
There is no out of here Youve been
killed Dont you remember

A DOCTOR approaches JACOB As he turns we notice with horror that
he

has no eyes or eye sockets He extracts a long needle from his belt
and

positions it over JACOBs head Like a divining rod it locates a
particular point near the crown of his head With a powerful thrust
the

DOCTOR shoves the needle into JACOBs skull and pushes it slowly
into

his brain JACOB howls

EXT VIETNAM - NIGHT

CUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence
of the film SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in
the dark of the night ONE OF THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a

long

bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines JACOB cries out

INT ROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO THE DOCTORS

The DOCTORS laugh and back away

DOCTOR
Remember

JACOB
No That was years ago Ive lived
years since then

DOCTOR
Its all been a dream

JACOB
No The army did this to me Theyve
done something to my brain
(he raves like a madman)
Jezzie I want my boys Sarah Im

INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

disappearing into the darkness

Suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead NORMAL HOSPITAL WALLS
materialize instantaneously around him A NURSE enters the room
followed by SARAH ELI and JED They approach JACOB who is lying in

traction

suspended over a hospital bed

NURSE

JED

SARAH

(smacking him)

(she reaches over and

rubs JACOBs brow)
What a mess huh God I wish there
was something I could do I love you
Jacob For whatever thats worth I

There is a sudden sound of DOCTORS laughing JACOB jerks his head
painfully but does not see them

DOCTOR (0S)
Dream on

JACOB
(yelling at the unseen
voice)
No Oh God
SARAH

Jacob what can I do

JACOB
Save me

JACOBs plea confuses SARAH She responds with a kiss
INT HOSPITAL - DAY

DAYLIGHT streams through the window in JACOBs ROOM He is still in
traction and looks very uncomfortable A new NURSE enters holding a
plastic container with a straw poking out

NURSE
Well dont we look better this

JACOB
Where am I

NURSE

JACOB

NURSE

his lips)

(staring at her
intently)

strange look)

She was here

NURSE
No No You havent had any visitors

JACOB
Thats a lie My family was here

NURSE

JACOB
Last night They were as real as you

are
The NURSE smiles and nods in appeasement

JACOB
This is not a dream This is my life

NURSE
Of course it is What else could it
be

She giggles nervously There is a funny glint in her eyes JACOB looks
away He doesnt want to see it

OMIT

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - EVENING

There is a loud commotion in the HALL We see LOUIS SCHWARTZ JACOBs
chiropractor screaming JACOBs name

LOUIS
Jacob Jacob Singer

JACOB yells

JACOB

INT JACOBS ROOM - DAY

LOUIS storms through JACOBs door followed by several NURSES and
ORDERLIES

JACOB
LouIS

NURSE 1
You cant go in there

ORDERLY
Youre going to have to leave

LOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the traction
apparatus He begins to yell

LOUIS
Good God Jake What have they done
(he examines JACOB and
screams at the NURSES)
What is this the Middle Ages And
they call this modern medicine This
is barbaric Barbaric
(turning to JACOB)
Its okay Jake Its not serious
Ill get you out of here

(yelling at the ORDERLY)
What is this the Inquisition Why
dont you just burn him at the stake
and put him out of his misery

LOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the
pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed The NURSES and ORDERLIES
become instantly hysterical and start screaming

ORDERLY
What the hell do you think

LOUIS
Dont you come near me

NURSE 2
You cant do that

LOUIS
What is this a prison Stay back

NURSE 1
You cant Call the police

One of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him with one
of
the pulley chains It just misses

LOUIS
(to the ORDERLIES)
You take one step and Ill wrap this
around your neck
LOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay
LOUIS
(continuing)
Hold on Jake were getting out of

here

NURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the room

OMIT

INT CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING

LOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that compared
with the hospital is comfortable and serene He pushes a lever and
the

table rises to a vertical position JACOB leans against it and rides
it

down to a horizontal position Every moment is agony for him

LOUIS

Half an hour from now and youll be
walking out of here all by yourself
Mark my words

(JACOB barely hears

them)
Well youve done it to yourself this
time havent you

JACOB
(nearly whispering)
Am I dead Louis
(LOUIS leans over to
hear)
Am I dead

LOUIS
(smiling)
From a slipped disc Thatd be a
first
JACOB

I was in Hell Ive been there Its
horrible I dont want to die Louis

LOUIS
Well Ill see what I can do about
it

JACOB

Ive seen it Its all pain

LOUIS
(working on JACOBs
spine like a master
mechanic)
You ever read Meister Eckart
(JACOB shakes his head
no)
How did you ever get your Doctorate
without reading Eckart
(LOUIS takes hold of
JACOBs legs and yanks
them swiftly)
Good Okay lets turn over gently
Right side
JACOB turns to his left LOUIS shakes his head in dismay

LOUIS
The other right okay
(he helps JACOB turn

over)
Youre a regular basket case you
know that

(he moves JACOBs arm
over his head)
Eckart saw Hell too

LOUIS positions JACOBs other arm bends his legs and then pushes
down

on his thigh His spine moves with a cracking sound JACOB groans

LOUIS

(continuing)
You know what he said The only thing
that burns in Hell is the part of you
that wont let go of your life your
memories your attachments They burn
em all away But theyre not punish-
ing you he said Theyre freeing
your soul Okay other side

He helps JACOB and repositions him Again he pushes and the spine
cracks

LOUIS

(continuing)
Wonderful So the way he sees it if
youre frightened of dying and hold-
ing on youll see devils tearing
your life away But if youve made
your peace then the devils are really
angels freeing you from the earth
Its just a matter of how you look at
it thats all So dont worry okay
Relax Wiggle your toes

JACOBs toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick unexpected jab to the
lower vertebrae in his back

LOUIS
(continuing)
Perfect We got it
(LOUIS pushes a lever
and the table rises back
up)
Okay Lets just give it a little
try See if you can stand

JACOB
What By myself

LOUIS
You can do it Come on Easy Just
give it a try

JACOB steps cautiously away from the table He moves hesitantly with
deliberate restraint LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing
the lame His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them
JACOB walks slowly without help LOUIS smiles impishly He looks like
a giant cherub

LOUIS
Hallelujah

LOUIS puts his arm around him Then JACOB tries again gradually
rediscovering his balance and strength With each step his confidence
returns LOUIS is pleased Then suddenly without warning JACOB
turns

and heads toward the door

LOUIS
What are you doing

JACOB
Theres something Ive gotta take
care of Louis

LOUIS
What are you talking about You can
barely stand

JACOB
Im walking arent I

LOUIS
Jake you need to rest

JACOB
Not tonight Louis No more rest

He walks slowly out the door LOUIS starts to go after him JACOB
turns

around and shakes his head no The look on his face is firm and
defiant LOUIS stands back and lets him go

JACOB
I love you Louis
EXT US ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

CUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the streets

of

lower MANHATTAN A CROWD is forming Banks of lights and television

cameras amass in the cold night air
to the scene

Police cars and mobile units rush

CUT TO JACOB In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch In the
other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the

steps

of the US ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS The volatile liquid splashes
against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement A five gallon
container lies emptying nearby Gasoline belches from it insistently

and pours onto the street Bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes

toward them

Television cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOBs direction
but at a safe distance He is yelling at them his teeth chattering

from the cold

JACOB

Listen to me There were four
companies in our batallion Five
hundred men Seven of us were left
when it was over Seven Four
companies engaged in an enemy
offensive that not one of us who
survived can remember fighting

BYSTANDERS

Use the torch

ONLOOKER

Shut up Let him talk

POLICE AMBULANCES are arriving at the scene FIREMEN ready hoses at
nearby hydrants TV CAMERAS are rolling

JACOB
(shouting)

You dont forget a battle where 500
men were killed They did something
to us I want to know the truth the
goddamn truth We have a right to
know

(he yells toward the

cameras)

Are you getting all this I want this

on national TV I want the whole
country the whole world to know
He holds up the torch A loudspeaker blares through the crowd

VOICE
Throw that torch away young man
Give yourself up Youre under
arrest

JACOB
For what For seeking the truth

VOICE
Please come quietly

JACOB
You come near me and Ill blow us all
up

VOICE

falsified my records Theyve lied to
my lawyer threatened my buddies But
they cant threaten me

BYSTANDER

BYSTANDER
Use the torch

VOICE
Okay lets clear the area Everyone
out

Suddenly a lighted match flies in JACOBs direction JACOB is enraged
He brandishes the torch at the crowd

JACOB
What the fuck do you think youre
doing

Another match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air PEOPLE on the
fringe of the crowd begin to run JACOB does not move

VOICE
Clear the area This is an order
JACOB
What is wrong with you

We hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd As JACOB looks out into
some

of their eyes he sees demons looking back One of them throws another
match Crazed JACOB runs toward them PEOPLE jump back

Suddenly JACOB freezes Standing on the sidelines he sees one of the
ARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car He is reaching for a gun
JACOB stunned yells at the top of hhis lungs

JACOB
No

With a defiant roar he hurls the torch straight up into the air We
see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher All eyes
stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder Then reaching its apex
just below the camera it begins its descent The eyes of the crowd
turn to fear SOMEONE yells

ONLOOKER
Hell burn us all

Screams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the potential
conflagration Only JACOB remains motionless standing silently
almost

heroically in the middle of it all

Suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with
a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions PEOPLE
panic TV REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN run for their lives The ARMY
OFFICIALS run too The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and
rush along the curb Water hoses are trying to douse them as they
spread JACOB surprisingly untouched by the fire walks slowly
through

the frightened crowds as if in a daze Viewed through the flames the
scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell

INT JACOBS APT - NIGHT

JACOB stark naked and covered with goose bumps runs his hands under
a

shower spray The water is freezing and taking forever to warm up
Anxious he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes grabs a
suitcase

from the BEDROOM closet and stuffs it with clothes Then he hurries
back to the shower tests it and jumps in

Lather covers JACOBs hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes His
entire body is covered in suds He is washing as quickly as he can
Suddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the BATHROOM He tenses

JACOB
Whos there Who is it

JACOB struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes They are burning
There is a shadow behind the curtain

JACOB
(continuing)
Goddamn it Whos there

JACOB rubs his eyes fighting to see Suddenly the shower curtain is
thrown back JACOB backs against the wall A hand reaches in and pulls
his nipple pinching hard

JEZZIE
Its just me

JACOB
Jezzie

JEZZIE

Who else were you expecting

JACOB
Let go

JEZZIE
Where were you Jake Whereve you
been Why havent you called

JACOB
Stay away from me Jez

JEZZIE

JACOB

He pushes her away and jumps out of the shower

CUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his
suitcase JEZZIE in a robe is watching him

JEZZIE
Why are you doing this to me You

JACOB

She stares at him with confusion THE PHONE RINGS

JACOB

fascination)

God almighty Yes Yes Right

(JACOB seems
uncomfortable)

Okay Ill be there

He hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment

JEZZIE

JACOB

unit out of Saigon He said he knows me
and that Ill know him when I see him

JEZZIE
How

JACOB
I have no idea

JEZZIE

truth

JACOB stares at JEZZIE for several moments but does not respond The
1100 NEWS is coming on JACOBs image can be seen on the screen We
hear the NEWSCASTER speaking

JEZZIE stares at the TV dumbfounded JACOB takes his suitcase and
hurries to the front door He opens it a crack and peers into the
hallway JEZZIE runs after him

JEZZIE
(almost threatening)
Dont leave me Jake

INT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

JACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the HALL He
stops at the stairwell and looks back JEZZIE is still standing there
She is very angry JACOB just stares at her for a moment and then
disappears down the stairwell

EXT WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

JACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY GROUPS OF MEN in black
leather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity
One MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches
him
MICHAEL
Jacob Hi Im Michael Newman
Friends call me Mike

JACOB is startled when he sees him He is the same YOUNG MAN who has
appeared throughout the film assisting JACOB in moments of crisis

MICHAEL
(continuing)
Surprised huh I told you youd know
me Ive been tracking you for a long
time I just wish Id spoken to you
before tonight

JACOB
I dont get it Who are you Why have
you been following me

MICHAEL
Observation mainly Clinical study
You were one of the survivors

A POLICE CAR passes them on the street MICHAEL grabs JACOBs shoulder
and turns him away nervously

MICHAEL
(continuing)
Come on were not safe around here

HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT

JACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER that juts
into the Hudson River JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAELs
story

MICHAEL
So first Im arrested right Best
LSD I ever made right down the
drain I figure this is it twenty
years in the joint if Im lucky
That was 68

JACOB
Long time ago

MICHAEL
(nodding his head)
Next thing I know Im on Rikers
Island Ever been there
(JACOB shakes his head)
Suddenly they take me from my cell to
the visitors room with those bank
teller windows you know Four army
colonels medals up their asses are
standing on the other side They tell
me if Ill come to Vietnam for two
years no action mind you just work
in a lab theyll drop all the
charges and wipe the record clean
Well Id only been in jail for
thirteen hours and I already knew
that Nam couldnt be any worse

JACOB
Shows how much you knew

MICHAEL

No shit They had me by the balls
Next thing I know Im in Saigon

in a secret lab synthesizing mind-
altering drugs Not the street stuff
mind you They had us isolating
special properties The dark side
you know They wanted a drug that
increased aggressive tendencies

JACOB
Yeah sure We were losing the war

MICHAEL
Right They were worried They
figured you guys were too soft They
wanted something to stir you up tap
into your anger you know And we did
it The most powerful thing I ever
saw Even a bad trip and I had my
share never compared to the fury of
the Ladder

JACOB
The Ladder

MICHAEL

Thats what they called it A fast
trip right down the ladder

(he makes a downward

dive with his hand)
Right to the primal fear the base
anger Im tellin you it was
powerful stuff But I dont need to
tell you You know
JACOB can barely catch his breath the information he is receiving is
so powerful to his mind

MICHAEL

(continuing)
We did experiments on jungle monkeys
They bashed each others heads in
gouged out their eyes chewed off
their tails The brass loved it Then
they made us try it on Charlie
(he pauses)
They took these POWs just kids
really and put em in a courtyard
We fed em huge doses of the stuff
(he stops for a moment

a tear rolls down his

cheek)
They were worse than the monkeys I
never knew men could do such things
The whole thing still blows me away

MICHAEL stands up and begins walking in circles around the PIER
JACOB
astounded gets up and walks beside him

MICHAEL

(continuing)
Anyway this big offensive was coming
up Everyone knew it Time Magazine
Huntley-Brinkley And the brass was
scared cause they knew we couldnt
win Morale was down It was gettin
ugly in the States Hell you
remember

JACOB
Like it was yesterday

MICHAEL
A couple days later they decided to
use the Ladder on one test
battalion Yours Just in an
infintessimal dose in the food
supply to prove its effectiveness in
the field They were sure your unit
would have the highest kill ratio in
the whole goddamn offensive And you
did too But not the way they
tnought

JACOB is beginning to shake MICHAEL pulls a container of pills out of
his jacket pocket
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Hey want something to calm you down
Made em myself

JACOB shakes his head no

JACOB
None of us can remember that night I
get flashes of it but they dont make
sense We saw shrinks for years But
nothing they did could ever touch it
What happened Was there ever an
offensive

MICHAEL
A couple of days later It was
fierce You guys never saw it

JACOB

But there was an attack I can still
see them coming There was a fight
wasnt there

MICHAEL
Yeah But not with the Cong

JACOB
Who then

He hesitates obviously uncomfortable His eyes grow puffy He looks
at
the river for a moment and then turns to JACOB

MICHAEL
You killed each other

JACOBs mouth drops open The words hit him like a truck

EXT VIETNAM - NIGHT

Gunfire explodes in the darkening sky We are in Vietnam JACOB is at
the bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK Chaos surrounds them Men
are screaming The ENEMY is storming at them from the rear ROD raises
his bayonet and jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER It is only
after a series of jabs that he sees its another American hes killed
RODs eyes go blank with confusion and terror

ROD
Oh my God WHATS HAPPENING
JACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of AMERICAN
SOLDIERS bearing down on them FRANK jumps up knocking JACOB to the
ground and slamming his rifle into JACOBs back As he spins around
JACOB sees another SOLDIER charging at him His bayonet is aimed at
JACOBs stomach For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his
attacker He is a YOUNG MAN about 19 years old clean cut wearing
glasses The two men stare at each other in terrible confusion It
seems like a moment out of time And then the SOLDIER lurches forward
and rams his bayonet deep into JACOBs abdomen

CUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER JACOB is ashen-faced

MICHAEL

It was brother against brother No
discrimination You tore each other
to pieces I knew it would happen I
warned them I WARNED THEM But I was
just a hippie chemist right Jesus
And I helped em make the stuff I
talked to the guys who bagged the
bodies Theyre in worse shape than
you believe me They saw what was
left Its a blessing you dont
remember Of course the brass covered
the whole thing up right away Blamed
it all on a surprise attack

he pauses)
I needed to find you The Ladder was
my baby

Tears start flowing down MICHAELs face He wipes them with his
sleeve

It takes him a moment to regain his composure JACOB is shivering
MICHAEL takes off his jacket drapes it over JACOB and leads him to
the wooden planks overhanging the water They sit and gaze at the
JERSEY SHORE

CUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light

MICHAEL
I always suspected the effects might
come back Thats why I had to follow
you I had a hell of a time getting
hold of your records

JACOB
If you knew why didnt you say
anything

MICHAEL
The truth can kill my friend Five
hundred men died out there This
isnt a story theyd ever want out
When Pauls car blew up I realized
the scope of the thing I knew they
meant business

JACOB
So why tell me now

MICHAEL
Because I can get rid of the demons
I can block the Ladder I have an
antidote We can kill them off
chemically speaking Theyll all
disappear Its chemistry my friend
I know I created it Come with me I
can help

INT HOTEL - DAWM

JACOB and MICHAEL enter a sleazy HOTEL near the docks obviously

frequented by a gay clientele JACOB is uncomfortable as they check
in

MICHAEL however seems to know the ropes They go to a small room

JACOB
You come here often

MICHAEL
Sometimes When its convenient

JACOB
How do I know this isnt just some
kind of you know seduction or
something

MICHAEL
Hey Im not the problem Youve got
bigger problems than me

MICHAEL reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial

MICHAEL
(continuing)
I came up with the formula back in
Nam but I never got a chance to use
it

JACOB
Never
MICHAEL
Id hoped Id never have to Just
open your mouth and stick out your
tongue

JACOB
What is it

MICHAEL
Dont worry Take it Itll free your
head Come on

JACOB
(fearful)
I dont know
MICHAEL

Yea though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death I shall fear
no evil but no one ever said I
wouldnt be shittin in my pants
every step of the way huh
(JACOB smiles his mouth
open)
Stick out your tongue
(JACOB obeys as an
eyedropper deposits a
drop of liquid on the
back of his tongue)
Thata boy Now why dont you just
lie down and relax

JACOB
One drop

MICHAEL
Its strong stuff

JACOB stretches out on the bed He stares up at the ceiling and
examines its pock-marked lunar look Long cracks and shallow craters
erode the surface It is an alien terrain

JACOB
I think Im falling asleep

MICHAEL
Pleasant dreams

The words send a jolt through JACOBs body He tries to get up but
cant Hes frightened
JACOB
I cant move

MICHAEL
Just relax

JACOB
Whats happening Help me

The ceiling begins to rumble Cracks split wide open Huge crevasses
tear through the plaster JACOBs world is crumbling He stares in
horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above
him

Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness Hooved feet and
pointed claws clamor to break through

JACOB
(continuing)
HELP ME

Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him He is holding the vial
with the antidote He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds
it over JACOBs mouth

MICHAEL
Take it

JACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the
eyedropper down his throat JACOB gags He tries to spit it out but
cant

Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break
off and collide like continental plates The collisons wreak havoc on
the DEMONS chopping and dismembering them Body parts fall from the
ceiling like a Devils rain Horrible screams echo from the other
side

MICHAEL
(continuing)
Dont fight it Its your own mind
Its your own fears

Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOBs head thundering like a
war in the heavens It is a scene of raw power and growing
catastrophe

It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes
JACOBs

eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him All space is
becoming a dark liquid void

Gradually the liquid grows bluer clearer There is an undulating
sense
to the imagery a feeling of womb-like comfort Strange lights appear
and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean JACOB is rushing
upward toward the surface

With the delirious sound of water giving way to air JACOB breaks
through To his amazement he finds himself floating out-stretched on
shimmering sunlit water Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty
that they cannot possibly be of the earth Pillars of golden light
reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light It is a
vision of heaven a vast almost mythic paradise JACOB is awed

A sudden movement catches his attention He looks over and sees
MICHAEL

standing before him Only MICHAEL looks different His face seems to
radiate an inner light a transcendental beauty JACOB is nearly
blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him

MICHAEL
So how you doin

The casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise He sits up To
his shock and amazement he finds that he is back in THE HOTEL ROOM
MICHAEL is standing at the foot of the bed JACOB is totally
disoriented His eyes move slowly around the room taking everything
in He doesnt speak

MICHAEL
(continuing)
It was better than you expected huh

JACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to
laugh
It is a huge laugh full of energy and life

MICHAEL
(continuing)
And no more demons I told you theyd
be gone
JACOB

I dont believe this Its a miracle

him Not a DEMON in sight Hurrying to the TICKET WINDOW he gets in
line The TICKET SELLER looks up

JACOB

JACOB pulls out MICHAELs credit card The SELLER rings it up While
he

is waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at him The stare
unsettles him The SELLER hands JACOB his ticket He takes it and
hurries into the CROWD Looking back he notices the POLICEMAN is
following him
INT MENS ROOM - DAY

JACOB enters the MENS ROOM He hurries into one of the stalsls drops
his pants and sits He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then
notices

a wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall It
is moving Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor JACOB glances at
the

hole curiously and leans forward to examine it He is shocked to see
an

eye staring back at him

JACOB
Goddamn it
(he covers it with his
hand A pencil jabs his
palm He yells)
Fucking pervert

Two lips form around the hole A tongue wags obscenely

VOICE
Dream on

JACOB
(shocked)
What

The mouth is gone JACOB hears the stall door fly open and feet
running

from the room He jumps up and grabs his pants He dashes out of the
MENS ROOM He hears footsteps and chases after them

INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

JACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL He sees someone rushing toward
the

main doors and speeds after him HOMELESS PEOPLE huddling along the
corridors watch as they run past Escaping to the street the MAN
disappears in the holiday throngs JACOB crazed stands gasping for
breath His fists dig into his coat pocket Suddenly he feels
something

and seems surprised when MICHAELs CARD emerges in his hands

OMIT

INT SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING
JACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING It is a dingy
industrial staircase poorly lit He reaches a door with MICHAELs
name

painted on it in large black letters He knocks loudly There is no
answer He pounds on it Another door opens on the floor above A head
sticks out

MAN
You lookin for Mike

JACOB
(panting hard)
Where is he

MAN
Dont know Hasnt picked his mail up
in days Its not like him

JACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes He searches around the
staircase

and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner He grabs a two-by-four
and lunges at the door

MAN
What the hell are you doing

JACOB doesnt answer He smashes wildly at the door until the lock
flies open

INT MICHAELS LOFT - EVENING

JACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light He finds it
The

LOFT is a disaster area Nothing is standing JACOB runs from room to
room In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab Glass
vials and bottles are shattered on the floor

JACOB rifles through the cabinets A few bottles are intact but their
labels mean nothing to him

He reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out
from

the bottom He opens it MICHAELs severed head stares him in the
face

It is smiling

A scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB has seen
JACOB jumps back trips and falls over MICHAELs headless body It is
lying sprawled across the floor

MAN
Oh my God

JACOB stumbles to pull himself up He is in a state of unrelieved
panic He runs past the MAN and spills out the doorr He takes two and
three stairs at a time nearly flying to the street

EXT SOHO STREETS - NIGHT

JACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as
fast

as his legs will move With unexpected violence he charges into the
side of a building Over and over he hurls himself against it He
grabs

for the bricks His fingers insert themselves into the crevices It is
as though he is trying to merge with the wall

Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street A taxi is speeding
toward him its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark
night JACOB steps into its path It is hard to tell if he is trying
to

stop the cab or waiting to be hit The taxi screeches to a halt JACOB
stares at it a moment and then steps to get in The DRIVER tries to
pull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside

INT TAXI - NIGHT
Rain is beginning to fall It streaks the windows

JACOB
(barely audible)
Im going to Brooklyn

DRIVER
Sorry Mac Not with me youre not I
get lost in Brooklyn

JACOB
I know the way

JACOB reaches into his pants pocket pulls out a twenty dollar bill
and hands it to the DRIVER He takes it

JACOB
(continuing)
Look this is all the money Ive got
in the world Take me home and its
yours

DRIVER
Wheres your home
CUT TO THE TAXI heading down WEST BROADWAY approaching the BROOKLYN
BRIDGE crossing the EAST RIVER and driving through dark BROOKLYN
STREETS

JACOBs face passes in and out of dense shadows Every time he is
bathed in light his image seems to alter Something in him is falling
away

EXT SARAHS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

JACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of SARAHS
APARTMENT BUILDING JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN

DOORMAN
Dr Singer Its been a long time

JACOB
(greeting him warmly)
Hello Sam

DOORMAN
(noticing JACOBs
battered condition)
Are you all right

JACOB

DOORMAN

JACOB

No dont But thanks

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
JACOB stops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand
underneath a section of the hallway carpet It comes back with a key
He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door He calls out
JACOB
Hello Its me

INT SARAHS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Some lights are on The APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy
JACOB
Hello Is anybody home Jed Eli
Daddys here

There is still no answer JACOB is surprised He peers into the dark
LIVING ROOM and then walks to the KITCHEN No one is around A photo
of

JACOB SARAH AND THEIR BOYS is sitting on the counter He picks it up
and carries it with him through the apartment He walks into his old
BEDROOM and then into the BOYS ROOM The beds are still unmade There
is no one home He sees his image in the BATHROOM mirror and turns
away
in disgust He walks back to the LIVING ROOM He is about to switch
the
lights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall He calls out

JACOB
Sarah is that you I hope you dont
mind I needed to come home

JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room She does not seem he
usual self She appears larger more imposing

JEZZIE
Hello Jake I knew youd come here
in the end

JACOB is nervous

JACOB
Whatre you Wheres Sarah
Where are the boys

JEZZIE
Sit down Jake

JACOB
Where are they

JEZZIE
Sit down

JACOB
No Whats going on Wheres my
family

JEZZIE

Its over Jake Its all over

JACOB
Where have they gone
JEZZIE stares

innocent sound at first

JEZZIE
Wake up Stop playing with yourself
Its finished

at JACOB with a frightening powerful glare The edge of
her coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him It is an

but after a moment it transforms into

something else an obsessive flapping noise the sound of a wing

JACOBs body feels the first waves of an inner tremor His legs are

shaking

JACOB
Whats going on

JEZZIE
Your capacity for self-delusion is
remarkable Dr Singer

JEZZIE begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him
Something about her walk is very unnatural JACOB eyes her fearfully

In the darkness JEZZIEs movements become increasingly strange and
elusive We see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it only

to reappear seconds later

room

in a doorway on the other side of the

JACOB spins around confused Suddenly JEZZIE is inches from his face
although it seems like there has been no time for her to get there

Her
movements are
laws

JACOB freezes

totally impossible defying all logic

JEZZIE
(continuing)
Whats wrong Jake
(she mocks him)
Forget to take your antidote

JACOB
Who are you What are you doing to me

JEZZIE
You have quite a mind Jake I loved
your friends That chemist - the
Ladder What an imagination you have

JEZZIE
(continuing)
And your vision of paradise
fantastic Youre a real dreamer you

all physical
know that Only its time to wake up

JEZZIE has disappeared in the darkness of the room Only the sounds of
flapping wings remain They grow louder and more menacing whooshing
past him with no visible source

JEZZIE
(continuing)
Your mind is crumbling Jake No more
army No more conspiracies Youre
dying Dr Singer Its over

JACOB frightened turns toward the door as if to hurry out JEZZIE
laughs

JEZZIE
(continuing)
Wheres to run Jacob Wheres to go

JACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind
him

JACOB
WHO ARE YOU

JEZZIE
How many times have you asked me
that How many times

JACOB
TELL ME DAMN YOU

JEZZIE
(with consummate power)
YOU KNOW WHO I AM

JEZZIE appears from the shadows Her coat collar obscures her and it
seems for a moment that she has no face Then to JACOBs horror she
turns around He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so
often before Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror
dark and undefinable Its face is a black and impenetrable void in
constant vibration Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry the
essence of fear and suffering JACOB pulls away from it overhwelmed
by

confusion He is rooted in fear

A sudden wind howls through the room great gales blowing JACOBs hair
straight up It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall He can
barely stand He struggles to pull himself away The flapping sound
returns charging at him from all directions It is as if the darkness
itself is swooping down trying to envelop him
JACOB
(whispering to himself)
This isnt happening

New terrible sounds arise chain saws slashing through the air

knives

and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger Guns fire and
explode past his head It is as though all the sounds of destruction
are closing in on him JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the
melee Terrified he looks heavenward as if crying for help

Suddenly from the noise a calm voice rises speaking as if froma
distance It is LOUIS JACOB is shocked to hear him He stands
motionless

LOUIS (VO)
If youre frightened of dying youll
see devils tearing you apart If
youve made your peace then theyre
angels freeing you from the world

The voice fades JACOB just stands there not sure what to do And
then

the sounds return Only now they are more terrifying than ever
Hideously loud they become a cacophony of sounds voices of parents
friends lovers the sounds of battle fighting and dying

JACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room All
the

sounds seem to emenate from it The more JACOB stares at it the louder
they become After a moment JACOB takes a huge breath We sense a
great resolve forming inside him Then slowly courageously he
begins

moving toward it

NEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB attempting to drive him
back but he will not be stopped He continues walking toward the
creature

In the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor It rolls
back and forth like a living thing with a maddening hypnotic
regularity Doors slam open and closed unlatching snapping
shutting

with deafening force The room itself seems like an organic presence
It is alive angry and threatening

The CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of
madness itself It writhes contorts and vibrates with unstoppable
fury JACOB terrified but unrelenting continues to approach it

AS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURES HEAD the density of its
featureless form overwhelms the screen It is like staring into
emptiness itself the ultimate darkness

With superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature It is like
grabbing hold of a live wire His body begins shaking uncontrollably
like a man being electrocuted He is flying in all directions but does
not let go His fingers claw at the creatures head JACOB struggles
defiantly with the monster

Suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it

CREATURE
WHO DO YOU THINK YOURE FIGHTING

JACOB does not respond It cries out again

CREATURE
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOURE
FIGHTING

Deep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the presence of a
form something writhing and tortured lurking before us It looks
briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human
face It is covered by a dark suffocating film like a mask

JACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off
CUT TO

DEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him from
beneath the mask It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw him on the
battlefield in Vietnam Only now his image is pale and lifeless It
takes JACOB a moment to realize that he is dead The recognition is
one

of terrible confusion and pain JACOB stares at himself for a long
time

as a huge cry wells up inside him It bursts forth with devastating
sadness

As that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of
catacylsmic power Hundreds of images from JACOBs life flash before
us his birth his childhood his adulthood The demons the room
JEZZIE LOUIS MICHAEL SARAH all seem to assail us in a rush of
blinding intensity

We are flying over a landscape of memories zooming across a
constantly

changing field of images Some of the images move some of the people
in them speak They are not particularly significant memories in some
ways they are quite banal but something about them is infused with
life and joy Even the painful moments resonate with vital force Some
of the moments we recognize from the time weve spent with JACOB Some
we have not seen before There is no order to them no logic to why
they have been recalled

A newborn baby takes its first breath and screams SARAH pulls clothes
off a clothes line on a rainy day JACOBs FATHER stands in the
Florida

surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs PAUL FRANK and JACOB play
cards on the edge of a rice paddy GABE rides his bike into the path
of

an oncoming car A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal
listening to it talk A young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her
blouse to show her new breasts JACOB and SARAH slice a wedding cake
that topples to the floor JEZZIE looks at JACOB and asks Love me a
little

And then it is over Total silence overwhelms the screen a wonderful
soothing calm JACOBs eyes open and he is shocked to find himself
sitting on the floor in SARAHs apartment He is all alone The first
rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window
Something about the apartment seems transfigured magical JACOB sits
motionless stunned to be back there

The faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway It is
warm and familiar the tinkling of a music box JACOB listens to it
for

a few moments and then something registers inside him Curious he
gets

up and approaches the corridor

JACOB
Hello

There is no response Suddenly the music stops JACOB freezes for a
moment He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end

JACOB
(continuing)
Who is it Whos there

Tentatively JACOB moves forward As he draws closer he begins to see
the outline of a child Then all of a sudden he realizes who it is
His eyes well up as he stands there the full impact of the moment
registering inside him Its his son GABE He is carrying the same
musical lunch box we have seen before The young boy smiles warmly at
his father It is the smile of an angel JACOB swallows hard

JACOB
(continuing)
Gabe Gabe

JACOB runs to his son Unable to hold back the tears he embraces him
in a rush of love and emotion
JACOB
(continuing)
Gabe Oh God dont believe

They hug one another over and over JACOB overcome sits down on the
stiars After a moment GABE puts his arm around his fathers shoulder
in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion We sense for an
instant that their roles have reversed GABE reaches for JACOBs hand
and gently encourages him to stand up

With a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps

Sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars hitting the first
landing GABE is bathed in its warm glow As JACOB reaches the
landing

he too is surrounded by the comforting light

GABE hurries up the last set of stairs JACOB turns to follow but is
stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above
Squinting he cannot see his son Then suddenly GABE steps back out of
the light and takes his fathers hand once more His eyes sparkle with
excitement

GABE
Come on Dad You know what weve
got A sandbox just like the
Willistons only its bigger and the
sands all white You wont believe
it

JACOB smiles at his son GABE smiles at him It is a moment of total
euphoria THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the stairs

GABE
(continuing)
And my parakeet Remember the one
grandma let out of the cage Hes
okay And hes talking now He knows
my name

GABEs voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the
intenstity of the light THE CAMERA HOLDS on the image For a brief
but

stunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase
shimmering before us It rises up into infinite dimensions Then the
brilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen

Suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source It
holds

for a second and then flashes off An overhead surgical lamp remains
stubbornly in view
INT VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY

A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask His
expression is somber He shakes his head His words are simple and
final

DOCTOR
Hes gone

CUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY FIELD
TENT in VIETNAM The DOCTOR steps away A NURSE rudely pulls a green
sheet over his head The DOCTOR turns to one of the aides and throws
up

his hands in defeat

AN ORDERLY wheels JACOBs body past rows of other DOCTORS and NURSES
fighting to save lives A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back a screen
door

to let them out of the tent It is a bright fresh morning The sun is
rising

ADDENDUM 1 PROFESSOR STERN

INT CITY COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

CUT TO a huge ampitheatre-style LECTURE HALL at CITY COLLEGE It
is almost empty No more than FORTY STUDENTS are scattered near
the front of nearly three hundred seats All are listening to
PROFESSOR EMANUEL STERN who is nearing the end of his lecture

STERN
Thus at the core of todays discu-
sion we find four fundamental doc-
trines First that the world of
matter and individual consciousness
are both manifestations of one Divine
Reality

One of the STUDENTS seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding
his head
STERN
Even you Mr Palmer are part of it
as amazing as that may seem
MR PALMER sits up quickly in his seat as other STUDENTS smile
STERN
Second human beings are capable not
only of kowledge about this Divine Re-
ality by inference but can realize
its existence by direct intuition
superior even to reason
A door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall JACOB

enters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range
of the professor

JACOB takes a seat at one of the desks

STERN
Third man possesses a double nature
an ego and an eternal self what we
call spirit or soul

on it which he fingers distractedly

MR

PALMER is

STERN
Fourth and most important mans
life on earth has only one end and
purpose to learn to let go of the
separate ego and to identify with the
Divine spark within

nodding off again

STERN
Almost impossible to believe isnt
it Mr Palmer that somewhere in that
unconscious head of yours lies the
source of all consciousness

PALMER
Yes Sir Very hard

There is a pencil lying
STERN
(nodding his head)
Well now having reached this
apotheosis there seems little if
anything left to say So rather than
try you are dismissed

The STUDENTS seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden
dismissal They quickly gather their books and begin the long
climb to the exits Only JACOB remains seated

JACOB
Hello Prof

PROFESSOR STERN looks up and stares at KACOB for several seconds
before recognizing him

STERN
My oh my Doctor Singer Isnt this a
happy surprise

JACOB comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old
PROFESSOR

STERN
(looking at JACOBs uni-
form)
Are you in the service

JACOB
The postal service Im a mailman

STERN
(surprised but non-
judgemental)
Ah Neither snow nor sleet nor dark
of night I always admired that
JACOB
(smiling)

Its good to see you
STERN
Likewise
EXT CITY COLLEGE - DAY

JACOB AND PROFESSOR STERN walk down the city streets that
constitute the CAMPUS of CITY COLLEGE

STERN
And how is your wife Sarah no

JACOB
(shrugging his shoul-
ders)
I havent seen her in months

STERN
(understanding)
Ah

JACOB
Im with another woman now Were
both with the post office Midtown
34th Street branch

STERN
Hmm I dont suppose there are too
many philosophers in the post office

JACOB
Oh youd be surprised They just dont
have their doctorates thats all

STERN
(he smiles)
Last I heard you were offered a posi-
tion in the West somewhere Tuscon
was it

JACOB

Oh that goes way back They had a
hiring freeze one of those last min-
ute things Bad timing for me though
Middle of the war The draft

(STERN nods his head

They walk a moment in

silence)
Ill tell you Prof after Viet Nam

I didnt want to think anymore I

decided my brain was just too small
an organ to comprehend this chaos

STERN
(looking at JACOB with
affection)
Jacob if it was any other brain but
yours I might agree
(he pauses)
Tell me does your lady friend know
what a brilliant thinker what a sub-
lime intellect shes living with

JACOB
(smiling coyly)
I doubt its my mind that interests
her I tell you Prof shes a fiery
lady

STERN
(with a fatherly
demeanor)
Well try not to get burned You have
a great mind Jacob Dont let anyone
tempt you away from it

INT OFF CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JACOB and PROFESSOR STERN are sitting at a quiet table ina
nearly empty coffee shop They are both fixing cups of tea not
speaking Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN

JACOB
Ive got a problem Prof More Augus-
tine than Kierkegaard if you know
what I mean
(STERN looks at him

questioningly)
I need to know about demons
STERN
(surprised)
Demons Jacob Why demons Are you
writing
JACOB

No
(he pauses a moment)
I see them

STERN
See them
(he smiles uncomforta-
bly)
What do you mean Physically

JACOB
(hesitantly)
Yes

STERN pauses He looks at JACOB The intensity of his gaze is
unsettling and JACOB reaches for his tea The cup rattles
STERN
I know very little about demons Ja-
cob fleshy ones anyway I know them
as literary figures biblical ones
Dante Milton but Jacob
(he pauses)

this is the 20th Century We dont
see demons now

JACOB
I see them Prof Everywhere Theyre
invading my life

A look of concern fills STERNs eyes
JACOB

(continuing)
Christ I know how it sounds

STERN
Have you considered a doctor A psy-
chiatrist

JACOB
Yes

(suddenly uneasy)
I dont want them Im not looking
for analysis or drugs Its too easy
to dismiss as some kind of psychosis

(he pauses uncomforta-

bly)
Its more than that I can feel it I
need you Prof Youre the only one I
can talk to

STERN
I dont know what to say

JACOB
I need your insight your intuition

STERN sips his tea slowly He is thinking

STERN
Demons I dont know what to tell
you It sounds like a spiritual mat-
ter to me The problem Jacob is
that you have no context for it
Youre a renegade Existentialist suf-
fering demons a hundred years after
Freud How the hell am I supposed to
make it fit
JACOB
Im afraid Prof Nothing makes
sense
(he pauses)
Please help me

STERN

(trying to be delicate)
Jacob I dont believe in demons not
in the empirical sense I dont be-
lieve in devils fighting for our
souls I dont believe in enternal
damnation I dont believe in other-
worldly creatures tormenting us We
dont need them We do a good enough
job on ourselves

JACOB
(disturbed)
But I see them

STERN
Look I dont pretend to know whats
going on inside your head For all I
know its pathological and they
should be pumping Valium into your
veins by the quart But if youre not
willing to accept the help of sci-
ence and believe me I admire you
for that then youll have to do bat-
tle on your own What can I say Its
a lonely pilgrimage through our times
even for the strongest souls But to

be pursued by demons no less
There are no guides Jacob
(he muses)

You wanna know what Id do if I sud-
denly started seeing demons Id hail
the first taxi that came along shoot
over to Bellvue and beg them for
shock treatment Im no saint

JACOB
Hell you think I am

STERN
Ivenever understood you you know
that You were by far the best pupil
Ive ever had bar none Intellectu-
ally you were the most original the
most imaginative Who knows maybe
youve been elected to see demons
Maybe youre in touch with some-
thing Nothing would surprise me
about you Jacob Nothing

JACOB gazes at his old friend and mentor frustration blazing in
his eyes They are both surprised to see tears form and run down
his cheek JACOB reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly
STERN uncomfortable in the face of emotion turns away

ADDENDUM 2 THE PARTY AT DELLAS

Suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him
The DANCERS undergo a shocking transformation a full three-
dimensional alteration of their physical forms Clothes fuse to
their bodies like new skin Horns and tails emerge and grow like
exotic genitalia exciting a frenzy among the DANCERS New
appendages appear unfolding from their flesh Dorsal fins
protrude from their backs Armored scales run in scallops down
their legs Tails entwine sensuously Long tongues lick at the
undersides of reptilian bellies The metamorphosis holds a
biological fascination Bones and flesh mold into new forms of
life creatures of another world

CUT TO JACOBs face as it registers terror and disbelief He
stares at the DANCERS They are perverse corrupt aspects of
their normal selves He is mesmerized by JEZZIE Her flesh has
rown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake Her
ongue long and curled darts in and out of her mouth

epeatedly Her eyes are thin and domineering They lock JACOB in
heir gaze He wants to stop to run but JEZZIE wont release

ACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from

hem but it wont go away The music throbs His actions become
pastic almost delirious His hysteria attracts the attention of
he other DANCERS

to ot

A circle forms around JACOB and JEZZIE as their frenzy transcends
the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic
display JACOB is out of control His fury becomes a kind of
exorcism a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and
his mind

CUT TO JACOB as his eyes pass beyond pain The dark walls of the
APARTMENT fade away
EXT VIETNAM - NIGHT

Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness
outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large
cloud The faces are looking down and voices are speaking

VOICE
Hes burning up

VOICE
Total delirium

VOICE
Hell never make it

VOICE
Thats some gash His guts keep
spilling out

fq

VOICE
Push em back

JACOB (VO)
(crying weakly)
Help me

His eyes focus on the moon Rings of light emanate from it
filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance The rings draw
us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into
exhilarating speed The rush causes them to flash
stroboscopically and produce a dazzling almost sensual surge of
color The display is spectacular and compelling A voice can be
heard in the distance

VOICE
think were losing him

Suddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image a
kind of CELESTIAL STAIRCASE rising up into infinite dimensions
As we speed toward it it grows increasingly majestic The image
is so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp
what is being seen

Music can be heard in the distance It too is celestial in its
beauty Then unexpectedly it grows hard and insistent like a
heartbeat Heavy breathing accompanies the sound The image of
the STAIRCASE shatters and disappears replaced by intense
flashes of red and blue light The music grows louder and reaches
a thundering crescendo Then silence
ADDENDUM 3 JACOBS LIVING ROOM

INT JACOBS LIVING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO APPLAUSE from a real television game show as JACOB
switches channels on the LIVING ROOM TV He stops on an
interview program turns up the sound and runs to the BATHROOM
The CAMERA stays on the television JACOB can be heard urinating
in the distance

MAC HAYES a young virile and smug REPORTER is speaking

HAYES
The Reverend Norman Murphy leader of
one of the largest groups supporting
the Armageddon Committee told our
cameras that we are no longer dealing
in decades but years

THE REVEREND fills the TV screen

MURPHY
The battleground is being readied
Our planet is the battlefield Our
souls are the prize All the signs
point to the inevitable confrontation
between the forces of good and evil
People must choose sides There is no
draft evasions in this war All are
called All must take up weapons Are
you prepared Thats the question we
ask

The toilet flushes and JACOB walks back into the LIVING ROOM and
turns down the sound

HAYES
Do you find people scoffing at you
Reverend After all there have been
doomsayers for thousands of years and
were still here

MURPHY
People are less apt to laugh these
days The prophecies are too close
for comfort I mean all you have to
do is watch the news

HAYES
There are some who claim that your
pessimism is defeatist and what the
world needs now is hope a positive
thrust

MURPHY
I think the time for hope has passed
The seeds have been planted We shall
reap what weve sown
(he pauses)
Pessimists no I think we are
percieved as the only realists

around

HAYES
Other movement leaders agree In an
interview

Suddenly the telephone rings It startles JACOB He jumps It
rings again He reaches down turns off the TV and picks up
the phone His eyes continue to stare at the blank screen as he
talks

ADDENDUM 4 JACOBS BEDROOM

INT JACOBS BEDROOM - NIGHT

THE BEDROOM is dark JACOB and JEZZIE are making love A half-
smoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed JEZZIE is
poised on top of JACOB and his eyes are focused on her face

A hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies Its
flickering light plays games with JACOBs eyes and for a moment
JEZZIE seems to disappear JACOB reaches out for her breasts and
his hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her
With sudden hallucinogenic impact JACOB feels himself drawn
into a starry universe opening from inside her

THE CAMERA plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and
rushes toward one that is twinkling brightly Pulsations of its
light whiten the screen Out of the whiteness appears a momentary
flash of the CELESTIAL STAIRCASE accompanied by sounds of sexual
climax

The STAIRCASE sparkles for an instant and then its gone The
sparkle becomes a glimmer in JEZZIEs eye as her face fills the
screen She looks especially lovely and radiant Her image moves
with the lamplight
JACOBs face is ecstatic He can barely talk and simply basks in
JEZZIEs glow Slowly she leans forward and whispers in his ear

JEZZIE
So tell me am I still an angel
JACOB
(smiling broadly)

With wings

(he strokes her hair)
You transport me you know that You
carry me away

ADDENDUM 5 DEMON IN THE WALL

INT JACOBS APARTMENT - DAY

JACOB is sitting in a comfortable chair in his living room He is
reading The room is dark lit only by a reading light The walls
are mostly in shadow The light however falls on one section of
the wall a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling

JACOBs eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood
grain on the wall All of a sudden he notices something strange
an image in the grain He stares at it The more he stares the
more precise its definition The image of a DEMON appears in the
wall

JACOB sits up quickly and stares at the walll It is impossible
to get the DEMONs image out of the grain It seems etched even
imbedded in the paneling

JACOB looks away and returns to his book He is reading about
archetypes and the primordial mind But the book does not hold
his attention He is obsessed with the wall Its molecules seem
suddenly active the wood grain suddenly animate Layers begin to
appear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly
define a rocky barren landscape

The DEMON is growing solid Cries and screams rise up in the
distance Flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending
rapidly into the wall The image of Hell erupts before him

JACOB stands up He can see bodies suffering beyond the wall
masses of PEOPLE wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery
world The DEMONs arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall
and reaches into the room He is huge covered in flames and
skulls a living horror He grabs hold of JACOB and pulls him
toward the wall JACOB tries to back away but he cannot His face
is white with fear The DEMON draws JACOB toward the inferno

JACOB
(yelling at the top of
his lungs)
NO

Suddenly JEZZIE appears the light from the BEDROOM flooding the
paneled wall The DEMON vanishes instantly

JEZZIE
Jake are you all

She stops dead in her tracks

CUT TO JACOB pressed up against the wall defying gravity and
logic as though about to merge with the solid surface His body
holds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor JEZZIE
goes to him

JEZZIE
Jake Jake

He doesnt answer He looks at JEZZIE with a blank stare His
body begins shaking

INT JACOBS BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACOB is lying on the bed curled up in a fetal pose JEZZIE is
stroking his hair and trying to calm him

JEZZIE
Its going to be all right Jake
Its going to be all right Dont be
afraid Ive got you now

JACOB
Hold me Jezzie Hold me

JEZZIE wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with
her own The image seems tender and comforting until we notice
JEZZIEs tongue darting nervously in and out It looks strangely
like a snakes

ADDENDUM 6 THE HOSPITAL
The RESIDENT injects the serum into JACOBs veins while two
ORDERLIES hold him still JACOB barely struggles His eyes fixate
on the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL It is white and sterile Within
moments it begins to emit a reddish glow JACOB watches with
astonishment as the walls two-dimensional surface separates into
three-dimensional planes The solid surface gives way to a DARK
CHAMBER that was not there before

Out of the transmuted space CREATURES begin to form Bosch-like
DEMONS with horns and tails undeniably of another world Slowly
several of them emerge from the wall and approach JACOB They
look like parodies of doctors and nurses wearing traditional
hospital gowns Without a word they wheel him through the space
where the wall had been JACOB tries to scream but no sound comes
out

INT HELL - NIGHT

The DARK CHAMBER is filled with mournful CREATURES being led by
DEMONS through a series of CORRIDORS No one fights or struggles
JACOBs stretcher is moved through the darkness He tries to sit
up but is forced back down He is obviously drugged

JACOB is wheeled into a tiny CHAMBER A number of DEMONS are
waiting for him Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling They
are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOBs
arms and legs The devices are manipulated smoothly and JACOB is
lifted off the stretcher The chains retract stretching him
spread-eagle in the air He screams loudly

JACOB
Oh God

The DEMONS laugh There is the sound of a huge door closing
JACOB is left in darkness The darkness is hallucinogenic Fires
appear beyond the boundaries of the wall images of Dantes
Inferno souls of the dead in endless torment JACOB is but one
of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment His own
screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying

Suddenly out of the meancing shadows a contingent of DEMONS
emerges They are carrying sharp surgical instruments They
surround JACOB their eyes glistening as bright as their blades
JACOB is panting and sweating with fear For an instant one of
the DEMONS looks like JEZZIE JACOB calls out to her

JACOB
Jezzie Help me

The DEMONS laugh as she changes form They take great pleasure in
his suffering Their voices are strange and not human Each
utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones sincere
and compassionate taunting and mocking at the same time The
confusion of meanings is a torment of its own

ADDENDUM 7 JACOBS BEDROOM

INT JACOBS BEDROOM

JACOB is lying on the floor of his BEDROOM doing exercises for
his back He has several days growth of beard and does not look
well His mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his
back reminds him of what he is doing JEZZIE can be heard
vacuuming the carpet in the LIVING ROOM Suddenly the door swings
open The wail of the vacuum cleaner causes JACOB to tense His
eyes drift down from the ceiling JEZZIE vacuums around him and
seems insensitive to his presence

JEZZIE shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits
something JACOB tightens She looks and is shocked to discover a
can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches It takes her a
second to understand the implications of what she has found
JACOB is ready when she begins yelling

JEZZIE
Youre completely off your rocker
you know that Youd think you fell
on your head instead of your back
What are you planning to do burn
down the apartment along with your
demons

She begins to remove the gasoline can

JACOB
(yelling)
Dont you touch it
(he glares at her)

JEZZIE lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum She moves it
furiously across the carpet Suddenly JACOB sees her tongue
darting in and out unconsciously She looks strange not human
JACOB freezes He yells out

JACOB
Who are you

The sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice He yells
again JEZZIE sees him and turns off the machine His voice booms
out

JACOB
(continuing)
Who the hell are you

JEZZIE ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on
JACOB rolls over and pulls out the plug

JACOB
Why wont you answer me

JEZZIE

(angry)
Cause you know goddamn well who I am

JACOB
I dont know you

JEZZIE
Youve lived with me for two years

JACOB
That doesnt mean shit Where do you
come from huh And I dont mean
Indiana

JEZZIE
What do you want me to say My
mothers tummy

JACOB
You know goddamn well what I mean

JEZZIE
Youre out of your fucking mind Im
not gonna stand around here gettin
interrogated by you

JACOB
Well leave then Go to Hell

JEZZIE

(furious)
You son-of-a-bitch Who do you think
you are I dont deserve this Who
takes care of you day and night Who
cleans the floor and washes your
goddamn underwear Well Ive had it
You flip out on your own you
ungrateful bastard Im done holding
your hand I dont want anything to
do with you you hear Nothing

She storms out of the room kicking the vacuum cleaner as she
goes JACOB can see flashes of her through the open crack of the
bedroom door Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the
opening along with a flood of tears

JACOB catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall
closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer He can
see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter
as she stomps on it with her foot There is a blur as she heads
to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves

JACOBs eyes drift up to the ceiling They hardly blink He
stares at the plaster chipped and cracked above him Suddenly
the cracks begin to move JACOB jumps up A DEMON is
materializing over his head JACOB yells and grabs hold of the
extension pole for the vacuum cleaner With a furious cry he
begins jamming it at the ceiling Rather than blot out the
evolving image his attack helps to define it JACOB slams harder
Plaster and wood lath cover the floor The DEMON is gone Panting
hard JACOB reaches for matches and the gasoline can He stops
and stares at them with great intensity

ADDENDUM 8 THE ANTIDOTE SEQUENCE

The ceiling begins to rumble Cracks split wide open Huge
crevasses tear through the plaster JACOBs world is crumbling
He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the
rupture above him Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the
darkness Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through

JACOB
(continuing)
HELP ME

Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him He is holding the
vial with the antidote He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid
and holds it over JACOBs mouth

MICHAEL
Take it

JACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the
eyedropper down his throat JACOB gags He tries to spit it out
but cant

Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks
break off and collide with one another like continental plates
The collisions wreak havoc on the DEMONS chopping and
dismembering them Body parts fall from the ceiling like a
Devils rain Horrible screams echo from the other side

Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOBs head thundering
like a war in the heavens It is a scene of raw power and growing
catastrophe It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the
ceiling explodes

Matter atomizes instantly Trillions of particles hurl
chaotically in all directions The walls shatter into a dazzling
brightness For a moment there is a sense of intense forward
movement a rush toward oblivion And then suddenly it stops
There is absolute quiet and stillness

JACOBs eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him
All space has become a shining void Gradually faint pastel
colors appear like colored molecules dancing and spinning
redirecting space into new formations They weave patterns of
intricate complexity and stunning beauty

As the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction
gives way to solid form A GARDEN SCENE emerges It is a GARDEN
OF LIGHT a vast almost mythic Rousseau paradise It radiates
an intense shimmering light

JACOBs eyes are cpativated by the vision before him A sudden
movement catches his attention He looks up and notices MICHAEL
still standing beside him MICHAEL however is rapidly changing
form It is a full plastic three-dimensional metamorphosis His
very flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light His
face shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty

JACOB is nearly blinded by MICHAELs presence and must shield his
eyes to look at him MICHAEL smiles an extraordinary and joyous
smile that radiates such intense luminosity that JACOB has to
squint to see it

Suddenly MICHAEL steps off the ground He rises into the air and
floats above JACOB JACOB can barely breathe as he watches him
MICHAEL rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights The
lights shine on JACOBs head He effervesces and shimmers in
their glow

One of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over JACOB So
intense is the light that JACOB grabs his eyes As he opens them
again he sees that the GARDEN is fading back into pure light
MICHAEL too is fading

Another burst of light and the GARDEN is reabsorbed by the void
Only the brightness remains It is many seconds before we realize
that the HOTEL ROOM is coming together reconstructed by the
light In moments it is fully formed Sunlight is pouring through
the window MICHAEL is sleeping lightly in a chair He hears
JACOB stare and sits up

JACOB is sitting on the bed He does not seem to know where he
is His eyes are filled with awe They move slowly around the
room taking everything in He doesnt speak MICHAEL gets up and
sits beside him He respects his silence

ADDENDUM 9 HOTEL ROOM

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

JACOB enters the HOTEL ROOM JEZZIE is already there watching the
evening news She is still in her postal uniform lying on the
bed She taps the mattress inviting JACOB to lie next to her A
WOMAN is crying to a REPORTER on the TV

WOMAN

thing like this before Its like he

linois anyway But you gotta give me

JACOB

JEZZIE

JACOB

There is a quiet rage building in JEZZIEs eyes as she continues
to stroke JACOBs chest He tries to relax and give himself over
to the movement of her hand Silently she leans over and begins
licking his stomach JACOBs eyes close His stomach hardens He
reaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head Slowly
JEZZIE works her way back up to his chest Her tongue darts in
and out suggestively He eyes are burning with anger Her mouth
poises itself over his nipple She toys with it for a few seconds
and then chomps down hard The bite draws blood

JACOB screams His eyes shoot open For the flash of an instant
he sees a DEMON hovering over him a hideous horned creature
licking his blood JACOB flies off the bed as the creature hurls
to the floor JACOB is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it
is JEZZIE lying at his feet His head begins reeling He backs
away from the bed not taking his eyes off JEZZIE for a second
He backs to the closet and grabs his coat
JEZZIE
Jake What are you doing Look Im
sorry I didnt mean to bite Let me
get you a towel

JACOB grabs his wallet and his glasses He backs toward the door

JEZZIE
Jake dont You cant leave Youre
not seeing things clearly The drugs
wearing off

She stands up and begins to approach him JACOB lifts up a desk
chair and holds it in front of him Blood is running down his
chest

JEZZIE
Jake dont leave me

JACOB throws the chair at the floor opens the door and hurries
into the HALLWAY JEZZIE scurries around the chair and runs to
the door She yells after him but he is already gone

ADDENDUM 10 THE END OF THE MOVIE

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

JACOB stoops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand
underneath a section of the hallway carpet It comes back with a
key He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door

JACOB
(calling out)
Hello Its me

INT SARAHS APARTMENT - NIGHT
The lights are on and the APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy
JACOB
Hello Is anyone home Jed Elie Dad-
dys here
There is still no answer JACOB is surprised He walks into the

LIVING ROOM and then the KITCHEN No one is around He walks into
his old BEDROOM and then the BOYS ROOM He is surprised to hear
footsteps coming down the hall He turns around and calls out

JACOB
Sarah is that you I hope you dont
mind I needed to come home

JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room She does not seem
to be her usual self She seems larger more imposing

JEZZIE
Hello Jake I knew youd come here
in the end

JACOB is nervous

JACOB
Wheres Sarah Where are the boys

JEZZIE
Sit down Jake

JACOB

JEZZIE
Sit down

JACOB
No Whats going on Wheres my
family

JEZZIE

JACOB
Where have they gone

JEZZIE
Wake up Stop playing with yourself
Its finished

JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening powerful glare Her
lips snarl Her tongue begins darting in and out only now it is
not a nervous habit but a conscious act JACOBs body feels the
first waves of an inner tremor His legs are shaking

JACOB
Whats going on

JEZZIE smiles at him Her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from
her mouth beyond human extension JACOB recoils
JACOB
(whispering to himself)
This isnt happening

JEZZIE
Your capacity for self-delusion is
remarkable Dr Singer

JEZZIEs head begins to tighten and squeeze as though she is
suffering from cramps JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives
birth to pointed horns

JACOB
Oh God

JEZZIE
Whats wrong Jake
(she mocks him)
Forget to take your antidote

JACOB
(screaming)
Goddamn you

JEZZIE

(smiling and then

laughing)
I loved your chemist Jake The
height of fantasy And your vision of
paradise

(she laughs with a hu-

miliating tone)
A most romantic creation Youre
quite a dreamer Jake Only its time
to wake up

JACOBs eyes are locked on JEZZIE His mouth is wide open His
body is shaking badly He tries to back away from her but his
legs barely move

JEZZIE
There is nowhere to run Jacob
Youre home

Suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor Plaster
from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the
carpet Light bulbs and lamps explode JACOB runs to the door He
pulls it open and screams He is on the edge of a fiery abyss
JEZZIE laughs with a new intensity of demonic force JACOB spins
around

JACOB
WHO ARE YOU

JEZZIE
How many times have you asked me
that How many times

JACOB
TELL ME DAMN YOU

JEZZIE
(with consummate power)
You know who I am

Suddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all
her might It is an act of total unrelieved grotesqueness With
each yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself
inside out before JACOBs eyes

The emerging creature is JEZZIE transfigured a demonic presence
beyond anything we have seen before It is black and covered with
a thick oozing slime Its head still recognizable as JEZZIE is
rodent-like with piercing green eyes and terrible horns
protruding from its brow Its powerful arms have long spiked
claws Its feet are cloven hooves Extending from its back is a
long thick muscular tail that whips around the room with
devastating force It throws furniture crashing through the air

A sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMONs back Dark forms
penetrate the air JACOB is breathless as huge wings unfold and
spread out to the living room walls The sound of their flapping
is deafening The walls shatter from their blows As they crumble
darkness appears on the other side There are no other rooms The
VOID envelops them The INFERNO emerges in all directions The
DEMON roars

DEMON
(with JEZZIEs voice)
Still love me Jake
(it laughs and reaches
out to him)
COME

CUT TO JACOBs face He has gone beyond fear An intensity of
rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before His
whole image seems transformed by it He glows like a volcano
before it erupts

Suddenly he explodes The full fury of the Ladder detonates
inside him He yells at the DEMON with all his might

JACOB
With a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the
DEMON JACOB is battling for his very soul and tears at the DEMON
with an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise Its giant
wings flap furiously lifting them both up off the floor JACOB
keeps fighting He claws bites and rips at the wings
decimating their delicate fabric

The DEMON shocked and trying to gain control crashes up
through the last fragments of the ceiling JACOB does not let go
They burst into the fiery darkness The room crumbles beneath
them and disappears into the void

The abyss opens beneath them JACOB continues his attack His
legs are locked around the DEMONs waist His hands dig into her
eyes The DEMON shrieks and surges downward with awesome
velocity

The DEMON charges into a rocky slope smashing JACOB into its
cliffs JACOB claws at her wings shredding as much of them as he
can reach The DEMON takes a huge chunk out of JACOBs arm JACOB
screams grabs a rock and shatters the DEMONs teeth The DEMON
falls to the ground JACOB holds on

All of a sudden the DEMON begins to shrink JACOB is shocked and
struggles to contain it As it dwindles in size it reorders its
shape Within seconds a powerful INSECT is cupped in his hands
JACOB tries to crush it but it stings with such force that
JACOBs entire body recoils The stinging persists JACOB hurls
himself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the CREATURE
down So massive is the INSECTs attack however that JACOBs
whole body heaves off the ground with each sting Then the
attacks subside JACOB waits for the next blow

Suddenly JACOBs body shoots straight up His hands fly apart as
a new life form erupts between them He holds on tightly as flesh
and blood mold and expand between his fingers The new body takes
rapid shape It is a CHILD JACOB grasps it with all his might as
it completes its identity He is horrified when he sees it It is
his son

ELI
Daddy

JACOB
Oh God

ELI

Youre hurting me

JACOB
(yelling)
Stop

ELI
Daddy Let go

JACOB
What do you want from me

ELI
LET GO

JACOB does not let up In an instant his SON explodes into a
gelatinous form constantly undulating and changing shape Within
its translucent mass a new body is forming JACOB stares at it
with growing terror It is himself A terrible perplexity fills
JACOBs eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image
He recoils as his own voice calls out to him

VOICE
Who the Hell do you think youre
fighting

The words shock him and for the first time he lets go

Instantly the image disappears and the jelly-like mass dissolves
into an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet JACOB looks down
at the shallow pool spreading out beneath him Its surface
reflects a smoky unearthly light

JACOB gazes into the darkness He is all alone The quiet
overwhelms him The only sound is his own breath He looks
around in all directions but can see nothing The CAMERA holds
on him as he stands waiting for the next assault but nothing
comes He is left only with his anticipation and with hinself He
stares at the terrible darkness

A subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath
JACOBs feet He steps away from it but it follows his movement
Suddenly as if by spontaneous combustion it bursts into flames
JACOB screams and tries to run but the flames move with him
lapping at his legs He cannot escape them As far and as fast as
he runs the fire is with him He yells and cries and screams as
the fire eats at his lower limbs He falls and jumps back up
again his hands charred His eyes grow wild

JACOB
Oh God help me

Instantly the flames roar and engulf him It is total
conflagration JACOBs skin blisters and turns black His flesh
crackles Writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can
find no freedom from his suffering
All at once JACOB stops running He throws his hands up into the
burning air and stands motionless in absolute agony It is a
gesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond
himself His flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly
quiet inside him

Through the flames JACOBs dark form can be seen as it slowly
sits down like a Buddhist monk in the midst of the holocaust
He appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate
him

Gradually the fire dies JACOBs body his flesh like a charred
and brittle shell sits motionless beyond pain An orange glow
from the embers of his body slowly fades leaving him in the
final darkness

The SCREEN stays dark for as long as possible Then slowly an
eerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky It backlights JACOB
revealing his silhouette The CAMERA dollies slowly toward him
It approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of JACOBs
face It is the face of death The CAMERA holds on the image

Suddenly with shocking impact JACOBs eyes move Within the
crumbling shell of a body something is still alive still
conscious The eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings
of a new light

It is dawn JACOBs dark remains are suffused by a preternatural
glow Slowly huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon JACOBs
eyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in
the still dark lansdcape Gradually the orbs begin their ascent
like a thousand suns rising at the same time JACOBs eyes widen
as his new world stands revealed He is sitting in a GARDEN OF
LIGHT the Rousseau paradise he has visited once before

A sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead The
vegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft
glow Like a gentle breeze MICHAEL descends from the light and
stands radiant before JACOB He smiles and the air itself seems
to brighten MICHAEL quietly approaches JACOBs body

MICHAEL
I am with you Jacob

JACOB stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and
disbelief

MICHAEL
(speaking with a gentle
compassion)
Its all right now Its over Youve
won Youre here
(JACOB stares at him
questioningly MICHAEL
reaches out his hands)
Trust me

Softly MICHAEL places his hands on top of JACOBs head and begins
to peel at the charred flesh Layer by layer he strips it away
Then with an unexpected gesture he rips away a whole section
with one quick pull A BLAZE OF LIGHT bursts through the gaping
hole in JACOBs head and beams into the air around them It is an
astounding sight

MICHAEL
Come on Dont make me do it all
(his eyes sparkle)
Stand up
(JACOBs eyes are burst-â€”
ing with wonder)
You can do it

Slowly JACOB begins to stir He moves feebly at first like an
old man His black flesh creaks and cracks and through each

sudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike
intensity

MICHAEL
Stop hobbling Your flesh cant hold
you anymore

JACOB nods in response and takes a huge gigantic breath His
lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body
as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it JACOB
stands transfigured filled with his own luminosity His face is
like a childs as he stares in amazement at his own hands
glowing with light

MICHAEL directs JACOBs vision to the sunrise It is majestic
almost Biblical in its grandeur Great rays of light penetrate
vast cloud formations and descend into the GARDEN Slowly the
clouds as if orchestrated by some higher power begin to part A
massive light complex emerges from behind them JACOB watches
awestruck as the CELESTIAL STAIRWAY stands revealed It reaches
down from unknown heights radiating an infinite power and grace
It touches down far in the distance hovering over many acres of
teh GARDEN JACOBs eyes are filled with its splendor MICHAEL
looks at him and nods

MICHAEL
Go on Jacob It has come for you

JACOB cannot speak His eyes are fixed on the STAIRWAY dazzling
him from afar He can see ANGELIC FORMS moving up and down it
Suddenly as if transported by light itself he feels himself
floating up into the air He looks down upon EDEN sparkling below
him His mouth is wide open as he soars above it

The light pulsating from the STAIRWAY is brilliant and thrilling
JACOBs own inner light intensifies as he approaches it The
STAIRWAY grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer It pulls
JACOB toward it

STREAMS OF ANGELS enter the STAIRWAY like a fast flowing river
It carries them instantly within its current up beyond the
visible reaches of the glittering sky Billowing clouds glow in a
parade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the
STAIRWAY reaches beyond all known dimensions

JACOB stares at the light that is about to absorb him It is a
moment of total euphoria He surges into the stream as the
brilliant light of the STAIRWAY overwhelms the screen

Slowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller
light source An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in
view

INT VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY

A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his
mask His expression is somber He shakes his head His words are
simple and final

DOCTOR
Hes gone

CUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY
FIELD TENT in VIET NAM The DOCTOR steps away A NURSE rudely
pulls a green sheet up over his head The DOCTOR turns to one of
the aides and throws up his hands in defeat

TWO ORDERLIES wheel JACOBs body past rows of other DOCTORS and
NURSES fighting to save lives A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back
a screen door to let them out of the tent It is a bright fresh
morning The sun is rising

THE END
