A TINY VILLAGENIGHT

Moonlight illuminates a mountain village consisting merely of a cobble
street and a cluster of modest cottages A jeep full of NAZI SOLDIERS
grinds through the deserted street as words appear SUPERED over the
scene

ITALY 1943

Peering from the cracks in shuttered windows frightened CHILDREN watch

shadowy NAZI SOLDIERS as they dismount from the Jeep

MOMENTS LATER

The SOLDIERS move ominously from house to house while A NAZI OFFICER
speaking in crude Italian questions a PEASANT WOMAN in her doorway
her CHILDREN clinging in terror to her skirts their eyes on the

towering NAZI whose face is lost in shadows

NAZI OFFICER
(Italian subtitled)
Americans Where

PEASANT WOMAN
(Italian subtitled)
No no Not here

NAZI OFFICER
(Italian subtitled)

Where How far How many kilometers

The CHILDREN cringe in horror as the NAZI OFFICER grabs the WOMAN

roughly by the arm shaking her

PEASANT WOMAN
(Italian subtitled)
I dont know
(pointing south)
That way I think Five kilometers

maybe

NAZI OFFICER
(Italian subtitled)

Youre lying you wop whore I dont

believe you

A VOICE (0OS)
(German subtitled)
Excuse me sir

The NAZI OFFICER turns to see a hulking NAZI CORPORAL approaching him

from the shadows his face lost in the gloom

NAZI OFFICER
(German subtitled)

What is it Corporal Youre supposed

to be watching the perimeter

CORPORAL
(German subtitled)

A message sir by courierfrom the

Fuhrer himself
NAZI OFFICER
(German subtitled)
What What are you talking about

The CORPORAL moves closer his face still shadowed his voice
apologetic as the OFFICER glares suspiciously

CORPORAL
(German subtitled)
The Fuhrer says theres been a
mistake were not the master race
He says were a bunch of perverted
fools

As the NAZI OFFICER stares in flabbergasted disbelief the CORPORAL
embraces him fiercely yanking a nine inch knife blade upward from the
NAZI OFFICERS gut ripping him open spattering blood on the
astonished PEASANT WOMAN and her CHILDREN

As the NAZI OFFICER slumps to the ground the big NAZI CORPORAL turns
on the dumbfounded PEASANT WOMAN and shoves her and her CHILDREN inside
the house His words are English this time

CORPORAL
Inside Presto Hurry inside

As he turns his attention back to the street we glimpse the CORPORALS
face for the first timeunshaven scarred tough and battle
wornthe face of war This is SERGEANT ROCK a thirty year old
American soldier of German descent disguised for the moment as a German
Corporal

Twenty yards away in the street two NAZI SOLDIERS are just noticing
the shadowy body of the OFFICER slumped on the cobbles in front of the
darkened doorway

ROCK opens up with an automatic weapon a grease gun

RATTA RATTA RATTA RATTA

OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE

WILDMAN a wild looking American Corporal blond and bearded erupts
from behind a rock on the craggy slope rifle ready

WILDMAN
Thats it Come on lets go

A lone GERMAN SENTRY startled raises his rifle to fire but before
he can get off a shot WILDMAN guns him down

Seven more American Infantrymen burst from hiding and move toward the
village and the sound of gunfire They are

TONY PASCALANO WHIPSNAKE JAMES BEEF RILEY TEXAS FLORES GERONIMO
JONES MIKE FARRACCI MARTIN KLUZEWSKI and TOM PARDEE
STREET VILLAGE

Still crouched in the doorway ROCK fires on a jeep load of four GERMAN
SOLDIERS as they pull up close to the bodies of the men he fired on

Bullets splatter around ROCK as the GERMANS crouching behind their
halted jeep blaze away at him furiously until theyre suddenly
distracted by shots from their flank

ROCK takes advantage of the distraction to hastily yank a grenade from
a D-ring on his chest pull the pin and toss it toward the jeep

BOOOOOOOOOM The grenade explodes
ROCK starts to advance on the jeep firing steadily
CRACK Somebody fires from behind him

ROCK whirls and hits the ground rolling seeing a dark figure emerging
from the shadows firing on him

DARK FIGURE
Given zee up asshole

ROCK
Hold your fire its me Dont shoot

The dark figure is WHIPSNAKE

WHIPSNAKE
Shit Sarge you sure had me fooled

VILLAGE STREETLATER

Two GERMAN SOLDIERS are squatting with their hands on their heads
while WHIPSNAKE covers them with an M-1

Two more GERMAN SOLDIERS lie bleeding while GERONIMO and PARDEE bend
over them tending to their injuries

Four more GERMAN SOLDIERS are sprawled in the street dead while TEXAS
searches them and KLUZEWSKI examines the dead OFFICER

ROCK is shedding his disguise revealing the fatigues with the chevron
underneath the German uniform as BEEF approaches him

BEEF
They didnt suspect ya huh Sarge
Ya walked right up to them

ROCK
Easy no problem

BEEF
No kidding You didnt talk to em
did you I mean did you say anything
in kraut

ROCK
Not much

BEEF
(awed)
You talked to em You actually
talked kraut with them and they
thought you were a nazzey God damn
Whadja talk about

ROCK
Politics

Nonplussed BEEF watches ROCK in American uniform now turn his back
and start across the street

Just then KLUZEWSKI approaches ROCK
KLUZEWSKI
Hey Sarge theres an officer with
these deceased guys in a different
uniform Like the ones at Kassarene
ROCK reacts sharply as we

CUT TO

STREETMOMENTS LATER

ROCK frowns as he stares at one of the dead bodies The uniform is
indeed slightly different from the others ROCK considers a ring on
the dead mans finger Then he rips the collar patch from the jacket

ACROSS THE STREET

FARRACCI is surrounded by the local PEASANTS including the PEASANT
WOMAN Hes talking to them in Italian as ROCK crosses the street
toward him

FARRACI

(Italian subtitled)
A lotta Americans speak German and
Italian Our parents come from over
here we got roots in the old country
My folks are from outside a Firenze
theyre always talkin about old
Firenze

Interrupting FARRACCI in English ROCK looms over the awed PEASANTS
holding up the collar patch from the Nazi uniform

ROCK
Ask them if theyve seen any more
krauts with outfits like this
FARRACCI turns to the PEASANTS as we

CUT TO

OUTSIDE VILLA MODESTOMORNING

Several rifle companies are bivouaced in a confusion of tents outside
an elegant Italian villa perched on a steep slope in the mountains As
GIs busy themselves waiting for more war WHIPSNAKE BEEF PASCALANO
and FARRACCI regale some of the other unshaven war-weary men from Easy
Company with details of last nights patrol

WHIPSNAKE

SsO were gonna sneak up on em
cause we dont know how many there
are or anything and the Wildmans
sposed to slit the sentrys throat
only he gets the dull edge of the
knife against the krauts neck

A listener named BIGELOW is horrified at the fuck-up

BIGELOW
The dull edge
BEEF
(triumphantly)

so he strangles the guy instead

WHIPSNAKE
and Rock sees theres no blood on
the uniform

BEEF
and the krauts about his size

WHIPSNAKE
-so Rock puts on the kraut uniform

BEEF
and walks right in there with the
krauts
WHIPSNAKE

and talks to them in German

BEEF
About politics for Christsake

As jaded and weary as the listeners are theyre all at least mildly
impressed by ROCKS exploitsexcept one a grizzled old timer
(thirty-five) named RETREAD

RETREAD
Hes gonna get us killed The man
takes risks
A storm of protest

FARRACCI
Careful risks

PASCALANO
An he takes em Retread Hes not
like summa them officers he dont ask
you to do somethin he wouldnt do

RETREAD shakes his head knowingly as if talking to children

RETREAD
That might be truebut there isnt
anything that asshole wouldnt do
So wheres that leave ya

RETREAD his point proven smiles triumphantly as we
CUT TO
INSIDE THE VILLA

MAJOR PRITCHARD battalion commander frowns as he fingers the collar
patch ROCK tore from the Nazi while CAPTAIN WALTERS addresses him

WALTERS
You dont want to discourage the men
from bringing in information sir

Theyre in the huge ballroom of the villa where furniture has been
pushed aside to create a ludicrously spartan Battalion Headquarters in
the midst of Italianate splendor

PRITCHARD
Of course not But I dont want them
playing genius and drawing conclusions
theyre not qualified to draw
either

WALTERS
Hes an experienced man not a new
recruit hes served in North Africa
he was decorated three times at
Kassarene

PRITCHARD
For bravery not for intelligence
I admire brave men Captain but Ive
observed that some of the bravest are
some of the stupidest In fact the
qualities at times seem to be
complimentary And stupidity loses
Captain (almost always) where smart
wins (almost always)

WALTERS
(coldly)
I guess courage is irrelevant sir

PRITCHARD
(a shrug)
We lost at Kassarene
(then )
Through no fault of the Sergeants
Im sure Send him in

WALTERS furious moves to the door and calls into the foyer

WALTERS
Sergeant Rock

WALTERS stands aside as ROCK enters and salutes the MAJOR smartly The
battered Sergeant looks particularly out of place in the villa

PRITCHARD
At ease Sergeant
(then )
That was a helluvan action last night
impressive in every way You

inflicted casualties on the enemy
without suffering any losses Top
notch soldiering You submit a list

of the men on that patrol to the
Captain and Ill see that every one

of them is decorated yourself included

ROCKS eyes drift to the collar patch in PRITCHARDS hands even as he
responds stiffly

ROCK
Im sure I speak for the men in
thanking you sir Theyll be
grateful

PRITCHARD has caught ROCKS look and now he holds up the collar patch

PRITCHARD
Captain Walters says you attach
considerable significance to this
patch Sergeant

ROCK
Ive seen them before sir In North
Africa Waffen SS Panzer Division

PRITCHARD
Youre not going to see tanks up here
Rock not in this kind of country
We tried some Shermans five of them
and we lost three in one week Not
to the enemy to the terrain

ROCK
Well sir with or without tanks
theyre crack troops theyre not a
defensive outfit

PRITCHARD

(cutting him off)
Sergeant youre not qualified to
speculate Im going to forward this
patch along with your report not your
conclusions to Intelligence where
itll be properly analyzed by
qualified people In the meantime
I dont want you gossiping around the
battalion

ROCKS eyes flash with suppressed anger his jaw sets his voice cold
and flat

ROCK
Gossiping sir

PRITCHARD
Starting rumors about an attack by
Nazi super-soldiers in tanks That
kind of nonsense can be very
demoralizing to the men especially
the Negroes Theres a colored outfit
in the battalion and those people can
get spooked by rumors and panic Am
I clear

ROCK stares stiffly ahead

ROCK
Yes sir

PRITCHARD
(turning away)
Give those names to the Captain You
did very good work Dismissed

As ROCK turns to go WALTERS gives him a secret rueful shrug but ROCK
doesnt respond exiting

PRITCHARD
See what I mean Guts up the giggy
but no brains at all he probably
cant fart and wipe his ass on the
same day too complicated

WALTERS
Hes not bookish Major but that
doesnt mean

PRITCHARD
(exploding)
Theyre not Indians Captain Theyre
not going to sneak up on us on tippy
toes theyre Germans Nazis the
Wehrmacht a war machine If theyre
gonna attack this pass theyll pound
the living shit out of us with
artillery theyll hammer us with 88s
and screaming mimis theyll bomb us
till were grateful to be attacked
for Chrissake Now do you hear any
German planes Do you hear any German
fucking artillery

As if on cue theres a whistling sound

The two men stare at each other and PRITCHARDS jaw sags as the
whistling gets louder someone SHOUTS outside and then

BOOOOOOOCOOOCO00OM The whole place shudders plaster falls as a shell
bursts outside close to the villa

OUTSIDE THE VTLLA
Chaos Death Blood Screams
RETREAD and BEEF are yelling for everyone to take cover

RETREAD
Inside Get in the cellar Take
cover

WHIPSNAKE is shouting for a Medic as WILDMAN and PASCALANO try to help
FARRACCI whos sprawled in a confusion of torn and twisted bodies
completed covered with blood As they free him another shell whistles
overhead and SOLDIERS dash frantically out of the way

BAAAAAWHOOOOOOOM A shell slams into the villa partially collapsing
the roof

WILDMAN is still holding FARRACCI screaming for a Medic

A red-haired youth a medic named OHARA is helping an injured man
when WILDMAN grabs him and indicates the bloody FARRACCI

OHARA looks at FARRACCI and shakes his head
OHARA
Hes gone soldier Better take

cover

RETREAD and BEEF are helping men into the smoking villa as another
shell whistles overhead ominously

RETREAD
Come on you assholes The cellar

INSIDE THE VILLA
In the smoke and plaster dust PRITCHARD is digging in the debris of the
collapsed section of ceiling uncovering CAPTAIN WALTERS as the next
shell hits outside shuddering the whole villa

BEEF and RETREAD are herding men past PRITCHARD toward the cellar

PRITCHARD
You Give me a hand

BEEF dutifully responds lifting a board and revealing CAPTAIN WALTERS
face WALTERS is weak blood tricking from his mouth He looks at
PRITCHARD and speaks weakly

CAPTAIN WALTERS
Fucking Indians

PRITCHARD watches horrified as WALTERS slips into unconsciousness and
BEEF takes his pulse

BEEF
Hes dead Major We better get in
the cellar
OUTSIDE THE VILLA

WILDMAN PARDEE KLUZEWSKI GERONIMO and TEXAS are supporting or
carrying INJURED MEN into the damaged villa heading for the cellar

PARDEE reacts to something he sees
OHARA and another MEDIC are hunched over a body the face so bloody as
to be unrecognizablebut the Sergeants Chevrons are clearly visible
and the bulky arms and torso clearly belong to ROCK
PARDEE
(shaken)
Oh Jesus

CUT TO

IN THE CELLARLATER

PRITCHARD is hovering over a RADIO OPERATOR whos trying to get the
radio equipment newly moved to the cellar to operate

RADIOMAN
(into radio)
This is Dog Easy Baker Six calling
Blue King Six

GIS are jammed in the crowded cellar the familiar bunch from Easy
Clustered in one corner arguing emotionally

PASCALANO
No way No way Rocks dead youre

RETREAD
Nobodys indestructible Pasky

PARDEE
Im just saying what I saw thats all

WILDMAN
An youre sure it was him

PARDEE
Yeah Im sure and he looked like he
had a bad head wound

PASCALANO
That doesnt mean anything you wash
off the blood it could be superficial
it could be

PARDEE
(erupting)
Hey I didnt take his pulse I
didnt take Camerons pulse that time
either Remember Cameron Huh Is
Cameron dead or alive

Theres a momentary hush at that then KLUZEWSKI speaks in a low voice

KLUZEWSKI
I saw him too

WILDMAN
Rock You saw Rock

PASCALANO
Was he dead or not

KLUZEWSKI
(grimly)
He looked the way Cameron looked that
time
Silence Grim faces as we

KIDSSNOWBALLSAMERICAN STREET

KIDS ten to twelve years old are furiously hurling snowballs and
shouting insults A SUPERED TITLE tells us where we are

AKRON OHIO

Its Akron a long time ago almost suburban The KIDS are snowballing
a dignified white haired gentleman MR VAN ROCKLIN whos walking
along a neatly shovelled sidewalk toward a corner Grocery Store

BOYS
Nazi Bastard Kraut Hey jerry
heil Hitler Sig Heil

VAN ROCKLIN wiping snow from his face with as much dignity as he can
muster addresses the boys in a thick German accent

VAN ROCKLIN
Hitler you cannot kill with snow I
am not Hitler I am only myself a
German

The speech only inflames the KIDS who while maintaining their
distance rain a fury of snowballs on the elderly man as he enters the

Grocery Store

INSIDE THE GROCERY STOREMOMENTS LATER

A paper bag The middle-aged CLERK is pulling it from under the
counter With a quick glance around to make sure no one is looking he
puts it on the counter in front of VAN ROCKLIN whose coat is still
dripping from the snowballs

CLERK
Twelve dollars thats the best I can
do

VAN ROCKLIN
That much

As the CLERK pulls a box out of the paper sack he indicates a
newspaper lying on the counter featuring a bold black headline GERMAN
COUNTER ATTACK and a sub head HARD FIGHTING ON ITALIAN FRONT

CLERK
Theres a war on Mister Van Rocklin
in case you didnt notice Guys are
dying This stuff is rationed its
black market

VAN ROCKLIN looks at the opened box Partagas Cigars from Havana
short stubby coronas

VAN ROCKLIN
Okay yes I pay I understand

CLERK

referred by a regular customer

SIDEWALKMINUTES LATER

VAN ROCKLIN hurries off with the paper sack while the BOYS pelt him
mercilessly with snowballs and hurl anti-German insults at him and
we

CUT TO

BERGAMO ITALYNIGHT

Its pouring rain in the darkened Bergamo a town just large enough to
have two hotels and a cathedral as a 4X4 US Troop carrier grumbles
through the darkened streets

INSIDE THE TROOP CARRIER

Instead of troops the rear of the vehicle is jammed with cooking
equipment and one fresh faced young officer LIEUTENANT GORYL whos
slumped on top of a field stove peering out through a gap in the
canvas covering Obviously unseasoned GORYL is getting his closest
look at war so far from the slowly moving troop carrier

GORYL sees a confusion of battle-weary FOOTSOLDIERS in dirty uniforms
hunkering in doorways out of the rain Bergamo has been taken over as
Regimental HQ and now although the town is blacked out lights flash
now and again revealing nightmare glimpses of defeat He sees into the
covered rear of a jeep where WOUNDED MEN are lying wrapped in bloody
bandages their eyes dull with horror plasma-bottles feeding into
their arms

Big guns are booming monotonously somewhere in the distance as the
carrier inches through the narrow main street jammed with muddy
battered vehicles and exhausted beaten GIS passing the local
Cathedral now serving as a hospital GORYL cringes at the sound of a
piteous VOICE crying out

VOICE (0S)
WHERE AM I WHERE THE FUCK AM I I
CANT SEE I CANT FUCKING SEE

Looking out of the moving truck GORYL glimpses a stretcher bearing a
BLIND SOLDIER his eyes covered with a bloody bandage Its he whos
crying out as the MEDICS carry him into the Cathedral Hospital

Just then a bunch of COOKS rush the back of the troop carrier

COOKS
Hey stop Goddamnit thats our gear

As the troop carrier lurches to a halt COOKS swarm aboard grabbing
equipment ignoring GORYL who scrambles off the stove hastily

Among the COOKS we see but do not notice a FACE that well see
latera FACE that means nothing to us now and is in no way special
or noticeable

As the COOKS unload their equipment the CORPORALDRIVER of the carrier
moves into view and addresses GORYL

CORPORAL DRIVER
Thats Regimental HQ right across the

street Lieutenant

GORYL follows the CORPORALS indication and sees the local Hotel with
GUARDS stationed at the door and lots of in and out traffic

INSIDE THE CATHEDRALNIGHT

The ceiling is lost in a vaulted gloom dominated by shadows while the
damp walls reverberate with urgent VOICES cries of pain desperate
moans Is this Hell Is this a nightmare

Its what ROCK is seeing as his eyes blink open and he stares stupidly
obviously confused and disoriented while the BLIND MANS VOICE
(offscreen but close at hand) seems to express ROCKS own confusion in
an urgent refrain

BLIND SOLDIERS VOICE (0S)
Where am I Where the fuck am I
Please goddamnit tell me Where am
I
ROCK is flat on his back on a cot His skull has been partially shaven
and partly bandaged his face has new scars his neck is heavily
bandaged as well He lifts his head cautiously and looks around

MEDICS and DOCTORS are rushing about in lantern light UNCONSCIOUS
SOLDIERS plasma bottles plugged into them bump urgently past on
stretchers hauled by more MEDICS

BLIND SOLDIERS VOICE (0S)
Can anybody hear me Please

ROCK looks to his right The BANDAGED MAN on the next cot is
motionless and silent clearly not the speaker Searching for the
VOICE ROCK looks down between the cots and sees the BLIND SOLDIER
lying on a stretcher on the floor The BLIND SOLDIER is tugging at his
bandages pulling them off his eyes

BLIND SOLDIER
I cant see for Chrissake I cant see
at all Where am I
ROCK speakswith efforthis voice weak tentative
ROCK
A hospital Its all right Itsa
hospital

More like a nightmare

INSIDE HOTEL HQNIGHT

Maps desks squawking radios jangling phones typewriters ENLISTED
STAFF OFFICERS Regimental HQ is chaotic hysterical GORYL hovers
nervously near CAPTAIN SLOANS desk as an enraged COLONEL CRONKITE
snaps at the beleaguered SLOAN

COLONEL CRONKITE
Make it an order then Henceforth no
line officer is to report that hes
pinned down by machinegun fire
mortar fire rocket fire or any other
fucking fire Is that clear

SLOAN
But sir if they are pinned down
dont we need accurate --
CRONKITE

(waving reports)
It says pinned down in every goddamn
report from every goddamn company
commander from every fucking platoon
leaderthank God the men dont
transmit individual fucking reports
because Im sure theyre all pinned
down Now Im going to assume
everybodys pinned down from now on

okay So dont tell me when youre
pinned down tell me when youre not
pinned down Thats what I want to
hearwhen youre not pinned down

Looking worried GORYL watches SLOAN nod wearily

SLOAN
Yes sir No more pinned down only
not pinned down

CRONKITE turns away and SLOAN scribbles a note then he turns back to
GORYLS orders on his desk

SLOAN
Easy Companys up on the line You
can get a ride up there in the
morning In the meantime bed down
anywhere you can

GORYL
Thank your sir

SLOAN is turning away GORYL hesitates then blurts

GORYL
I guess its prettypretty rough up
on the line

For a moment SLOAN just stares at GORYL blankly as if GORYL spoke
Swahilithen he shakes his head slowly

SLOAN
Oh no Lieutenant no no not at
all Its rough in hereup on the
line its just one bigone big
party Laughing and joking with the
goodhearted people of Germany who
happen to be visiting Italy like
ourselves

SLOAN turns away abruptly and heads for another desk leaving GORYL by
himself Feeling foolish and green GORYL heads for the door

Meanwhile SLOAN is addressing a PRIVATE at a desk

SLOAN
Type up an order Private The words
pinned down will not be used in
future transmission to HQ It is only
acceptable to report not pinned
down Colonel Cronkite will sign
it

STREETNIGHT

GORYL has paused for a moment in the dark street to look toward the
front where big guns thunder in the night

On the distant slopes the flashes of fire as the shells explode are out
of sync with the sounds of the guns lending an eerie surrealistic
quality to the obscure battle ten miles away It doesnt look
realbut its scary

GORYL turns away and enters a doorway
INSIDE QUARTERS

In the gloom of a former restaurant the GIS are only shadows and
glowing cigarette buttsand VOICES

VOICEDARKNESS
We were gettin all this shit froma
kraut fifty so this kid he works his
way to maybe 25 yards from em
fucking courageous Hes gonna send
em some pineapple right So he
pulls the pin Booooom Short fuse
Right in the fucking face

ANOTHER VOICEDARKNESS
I seen ugly and I seen uglier but a
short fuse is the ugliest

VOICEDARKNESS
Well it didnt kill him it blew his
fucking face off is all He was
screaming I cant see I cant see
Massachusetts guy Gimme a light

A light flickers and GORYLS face is briefly visible GORYL looks
shaken as we

CUT TO

HOSPITALNIGHT

The canvas over the stained glass has been partially pulled back to let
some of the weak winter light in

A DOCTOR is speaking to the BLIND SOLDIER whos on a cot now wearing
fresh bandages somewhat cleaned up

DOCTOR
Were going to do everything we can
for you Privateeverything But
your sight is gone We cant bring
that back thats not something we can
change Do you understand that

BLIND SOLDIER
(bravely desperate good
cheer)
Yes sir
ROCK is watching this painful scene from the next cot
turning a page of his chart

DOCTOR turns to him

DOCTOR

A SUDDEN VISION A FLASHBACK OF THE MEDIC OHARA OUT OF FOCUS SEEN

FROM ROCKS POINT OF VIEW AS HE SCREAMS AT ROCK TO BREATHE

THEN

VISION IS GONE
The DOCTOR is moving to the next bed

ROCK
I remember

Shaken

DOCTOR

ROCK calls out to him
(impatient)
Yes

ROCK
Aa medic Hesaved me

DOCTOR
Theyre good men Brave men

As the DOCTOR moves to the next cot where he starts to speak to the
SOLDIER virtually mummified in bandages ROCK just lies there staring
at the ceiling Then he hears muffled sobs Turning he sees the
BLIND SOLDIER completely isolated in his dark world of misery shaking
with the sobs hes trying to stifle

ROCK struggles weakly to sit up Looking around he sees the bustle of
the hospitalstretchers with WOUNDED MEN groaning MEDICS scurrying
DOCTORS

ROCK considers the bandages on his chestthen he pokes himself
looking for pain

Across the cot-cluttered nave a CORPORAL on MAIL DUTY is shouting
aloud as he distributes mail to bedridden GIS

MAIL DUTY CORPORAL
Awright Dog Any more Dog last call
for Dog Company Sing out (or bark)
if youre Dog

A VOICE
Yo Dog Dog here

The MAIL DUTY CORPORAL heads for the DOG SOLDIER as ROCK swings his
legs over the side of the cot and rests for a moment Then he

tentatively tries his feet on the floor

ANGLE ON A MEDICSECONDS LATER

As the MEDIC moves along an aisle between the cots hauling one end of
a stretcher he comes face to face with ROCK whos wobbling unsteadily
among the cots

ROCK
Im lookingfor a medic

MEDIC
Whats the problem buddy

ROCK
A medic withred hair

MEDIC
You better get back on your cot
fella

Maneuvering the stretcher around ROCK the MEDIC and his PARTNER move
their patient a BLACK SOLDIER onto an empty cot

ROCK pauses observing the youthful face of the unconscious blood
covered BLACK SOLDIER as the MEDIC quickly and efficiently hooks a
bottle of plasma to an IV stand beside the cot

A piece of tape on the plasma bottle says COLORED
The MEDIC turns and glances toward ROCK

MEDIC
Red hair Around here thats OHara

ROCK
Where can I find him

The MEDIC is pillowing the head of the unconscious BLACK SOLDIER as he
shakes his own head

MEDIC
Missing in Action About a week
Better get back in your bunk okay

MAIL DUTY CORPORALS VOICE (0OS)
Easy Company Anybody else from Easy

Still dazed and weak ROCK reacts as a SOLDIER in a cot twenty cots
away shouts

SOLDIER
Hey right here Im Easy

Theres a ripple of weak laughter and someone adds Arent we all

ROCK starts to make his way unsteadily in that direction passing
horribly WOUNDED MEN nearly stepping on a BANDAGED SOLDIER lying on
stretcher on the floor

Across the room the soldier from Easy GOINES is opening the the
envelope the MAIL DUTY CORPORAL has handed him He stares at the
contents in outrage and dismay

GOINES
Jury duty For Christ sake Im
supposed to serve on a jury in
Brattleboro Vermont

MAIL DUTY CORPORAL
No kidding I just gave a guy from
Iowa a bill from his plumber how do
ya like that

ROCKS VOICE (0OS)

GOINES turns and his eyes widen in amazement as he sees ROCK still
unsteady on his feet looming beside his cot
GOINES

MAIL DUTY CORPORAL

The CORPORAL has been digging through his big bag and now he produces
a neatly wrapped package which he hands to the stunned ROCK who barely
notices it as he accepts it ROCKS eyes are on GOINES bed Under
the sheets the shape of his legs ends above the knees where GOINES
legs were amputated

GOINES

Absent mindedly ROCK starts to unwrap the package as he speaks to
GOINES

ROCK

GOINES

ROCK looks numbly at the package in his hand Its the box of cigars
Coronas Theres a note on top of it

ROCK stares at the crudely scrawled note
Dear son I love you Kill Hitler Your father
OUTSIDEDAY

A lull in the rain Leaden skies The distant booms of the big guns
seem remote On the bland woodsy slopes twenty miles north occasional
flashes indicate exploding shells

More ominous is the steady flow of FOOTSOLDIERS and MILITARY VEHICLES
crawling into the town from the north like blood from a wound Troop
carriers overflowing with WOUNDED MEN tired plodding FOOTSOLDIERS with
haggard faces and vacant eyes suggest the true horror of those remote
hills and distant sounds

GORYL is in the street arguing with a PFC whos sitting at the wheel of
an idling jeep

GORYL
You just told me you had about sixty
miles of gas Private Thats enough
to get me to the line and get you
back so whats the problem

PFC
I thought you wanted to go south sir
This gas is southerly gas sir It
dont go north its a matter of
internal combustion

GORYL
I see What do I need to get some

northerly gasa written order from
the Colonel and threat of a court
martial

PFC

(starting the jeep)
No sir What you need is a lotta
luck and a different driver

RRRRRR The PFC pulls away into the confusion of troop carriers
jeeps and trucks clogging the street

GORYL is scowling in frustration when he hears an urgent shout

Looking around he sees SOLDIERS pointing toward the north where three
specks are approaching low over the mountainsgetting bigger
Planes

Suddenly SOLDIERS are shouting Butcherbirds Butcherbirds running
every which way jumping from trucks taking cover

GORYL hastily follows GIS into a doorway and crowds in as the three
BUTCHERBIRDS (Folke Wulfs) thunder in low cannons firing into the
crowded street machineguns rattling

GORYL sees a running SOLDIER cut in half

WHOOOOOOOOM An explosion shakes the town as a bomb bursts WHOOOM
BAH-BOOOOOOOOM KA-BLAAAAAAM MORE BOMBS

GORYL presses back among the GIS wedged like sardines in the doorway
driven back by heat from flames Hes cowering there when he hears a
SERGEANT scream in rage and anguish

SERGEANT
The bastards bombed the hospital
They bombed the hospital

The BUTCHERBIRDS are climbing off into the distance their bombs and
ammo spent as SOLDIERS rush to the hospital

Smoke pours from a gaping wound in the giant red cross painted on the
stones of the cathedral The ceiling and wall are partially collapsed

GORYL stares in horror He can hear screams from within the collapsed
walls

INSIDE THE HOSPITAL

Smoke Panic Confusion Chaos Vague FIGURES move about obscured
by smoke

GOINES lies dead crushed by debris across his chest

As confusion reigns all around and MEDICS rush to and fro a HAND
emerges from the debris near GOINES Grasping pulling its the hand
of someone pulling himself from the debris WE DONT HAVE TO SEE HIM
TO KNOW ITS ROCK

ANGLE ON CIGARS

The box of cigars overturned lies beside the note covered with
mortar dust

The HAND reaches for the box scoops spilled cigars into the box takes
the box and the note

For a second ROCK looks down at GOINES lifeless face ROCKS eyes are
like tiny diamondshis face like cold stone

A BOX OF UNIFORMS

In the midst of the smoky chaos THE HAND reaches into a jumble of
uniforms tossed in a crate in the corner of the nave THE HAND is
sorting through the torn and sometimes bloody fatigues

A BOX OF BOOTS

The same thingTHE HAND searching for the right boots

BOOTS WALKING

Through the chaos and confusion of the hospital THE BOOTS move with
purposeful stridesstepping over the torn BODIES and the debris

past the dead BLIND SOLDIER

DEAD CORPORALDEBRISNAVE

In the confusion and debris the MAIL DUTY CORPORAL lies dead sprawled
face down beside his spilled mail bag

THE BOOTS start to step over himthen halt A moment passes
then HANDS reach into the spilled mailsearchingfinding a bundle
marked COMPANY E

THE STREET OUTSIDE

A MEDIC is squatting beside a BLOODY SOLDIER applying a tourniquet
The BOOTS appear close to the busy MEDICthe HANDS reach down and
remove several grenades from the BLOODY SOLDIERS chestwhile the
MEDIC continues to work

A DAMAGED JEEP

The DEAD DRIVER is slumped at the wheel Theres a pack beside him on
the seat and an M-1

HANDS reach in take the packopen itdump it outstuff the box of
cigars and the bundle of mail insideclose the packtake the M-1l

A DAMAGED BUILDING

A Browning Automatic Rifle lies unattended beside the smoldering debris
of a bomb damaged wall

The BOOTS appearthe big HANDS scoop up the BAR
Likewise a box of ammo

THE ROAD INTO BERGAMO

The WOUNDED and the WEARY are still streaming into the bombed town
clogging the road with one-way traffic

But in the foreground appear the BOOTS One man alone is going in the
other direction

Its ROCK laden with a full pack an arsenal of weaponry grenades
dangling from his chest the stub of a cigar in his mouth an angry
look in his eye

Ahead of him on the faraway hills the big guns boom

ROCK heads straight for them carrying more than a man should carry as
we

CUT TO
FARMHOUSE SLOPE

MAJOR PRITCHARD unshaven and haggard is standing outside his new
less grand Battalion HQ a farmhouse which squats on a slope at the
southern end of a mountain pass Hes peering through binoculars at
the wooded slopes to the north above the pass He can hear the patter
of rifle fire and the chatter of machineguns in the woods

PRITCHARD
What the hell

Standing beside PRITCHARD a GI is watching a SECOND GI sprinting
toward them

GI
Runner sir

PRITCHARD lowers the glasses as the SECOND GI a runner staggers up
them totally winded

PRITCHARD

SECOND GI

The SECOND GI is pointing at the wooded slopes with their secrets

PRITCHARD

SECOND GI

PRITCHARD
(disgusted)

mouth of the pass on that side

The SECOND GI is pointing to the opposite slope the eastern slope

PRITCHARD

SECOND GI

PRITCHARD

SECOND GI

rest of Baker

SECOND GI
(indicating the slopes)
Sir theres krauts all over down
there Anybody down there is damn near
surrounded

ROADMID DAY

Scraaatch ROCK strikes a match without breaking his steady stride and
relights his cigar

Traffic flows past ROCK in the opposite direction retreating vehicles
and weary FOOTSOLDIERS heads down eyes unseeing Ahead the shelling
has stopped an apparent lull in the fury of the battle

Suddenly a VOICE calls out close by

VOICE (0OS)
Say Sergeant can I give you a lift

ROCK turns and finds himself staring at a fresh young officer at the
wheel of a jeep headed for the lineGORYL

MOVING JEEPMINUTES LATER

ROCK is behind the wheel now and GORYL is beside him in the passenger

seat GORYL sneaks glances at ROCK looking him over noting the scar
on his face glimpsing the partially shaved skull the bandage on his

neck

GORYL
I guessI guess youyouve been
up on the line already huh Sergeant

ROCK
Yes sir

GORYL
I guess youve heard of Easy Company

ROCK
Easy Company sir

GORYL
You must have theyre supposed to be

in North Africa the only company that
held ground when Rommel and the Afrika
Korps attacked the Kassarene Pass
Of course I guess it wouldnt be
really the same outfit there were
heavy casualties a lotta them musta

A 4X4 laden with bagged and unbagged bodies grinds past in the opposite
direction

ROCK
(remembering)
Rightheavy casualties
(then)

Why are you interested in Easy

Lieutenant

GORYL
Im their new CO

Deadpan ROCK shifts the cigar between his teeth as he considers the
fresh faced youth at his side and we

CUT TO

MOVING JEEPSEVERAL MILES LATER

The jeep is alone now the retreating army is behind them to the south
and the wooded slopes ahead are much closer GORYL is chattering out
of nervousness

GORYL

GORYL looks startled as we
CUT TO

WOODS DAY

TEXAS is squirming on his belly through the rotting leaves sweating
furiously casting nervous glances to his right

The woods to the right look blandand ominous The unseen enemy is
visible in TEXAS fear the way he hugs the ground and sweats as he
inches along

Arriving at the lip of a foxhole he looks over the rim at the grim
exhausted faces of RETREAD and PASCALANO who are crouched in their
muddy foxhole in several inches of water Theyve been fighting 22
days straight and it shows

TEXAS
Were gonna make a run for it

PASCALANO
In daylight

TEXAS

GERONIMO are huddled miserably

TEXAS
When he signals head for that big
rock back there about a hundred yards

BIGELOW and GERONIMO nod grimly and TEXAS crawls off leaving them
alone BIGELOW immediately burrows frantically in a pocket and pulls
out a half a pack of lifesavers With trembling hands he examines the

indecisively as GERONIMO watchesfinally changes his selection and
pops a green one in his mouth

BIGELOW

A MONTAGEDIFFERENT FOXHOLES

RETREAD looks stoic PASCALANO is chewing his lip nervously as they
crouch all ready to move

BIGELOW is choosing a yellow lifesaver with shaking hands while
GERONIMO watches deadpan

KLUZEWSKI aims the BAR over the lip of the foxhole while WHIPSNAKE
prepares a pile of magazines

BEEF and PARDEE are tense ready to go

TEXAS looks expectantly at WILDMAN whos coiled like a spring WILDMAN
sticks his rifle up out of the foxhole in two quick thrusts a signal

WOODSSECONDS LATER

Theyre running low eight of them zig-zagging among bare trees the
only sound their feet in the leaves Its spooky how quiet it is after
all the tension

One second

Three seconds

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA The German machinegun chatters
mindlessly bullets sizzle in the air

PARDEE lets out a sharp cry as he lurches forward then crashes to the
ground

CHATTA CHATTA CHATTA CHATTA The BAR joins the cacophony returning
fire

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA The second German machinegun replies
THIRD FOXHOLE

KLUZEWSKI is firing the BAR at the German position which is invisible

beside him WHIPSNAKE fires his M-1

KLUZEWSKI
How far are they

WHIPSNAKE

(looking back)
Not far enough theyre gonna have to
come back

WOODS

As bullets whiz over him BIGELOW hugs the ground and looks toward the
objective a boulder barely visible through the trees sixty yards away
on slightly higher ground BIGELOW turns and speaks to GERONIMO lying
three yards to his right

BIGELOW
We cant make it we gotta go back

GERONIMO doesnt answerand BIGELOW suddenly sees that GERONIMOS
eyes are glassy and lifeless

TEN YARDS AWAY

WILDMAN is calling out as he squirms back toward his foxhole twenty
yards behind

WILDMAN

TEN YARDS FURTHER

PARDEE is on his back moaning pitifully as BEEF bellies toward him

BEEF

KA-BLAAAAM Another mortar shell hits fifteen yards away and BEEF
starts to crawl for the foxholes

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSEA MILE AWAYLATE AFTERNOON

The mortar concussions and intermittent bursts of machinegun fire are
subdued by distance while the woods themselves like a mask reveal
nothing to MAJOR PRITCHARD as he peers through his binoculars from the
ridge in front of the farmhouse Theres simply nothing to see down
there in the pass Hes lowering the glasses when the FIRST GI
approaches him

FIRST GI
Message from Regimental sir

PRITCHARD

FIRST GI

PRITCHARD

(erupting)

PRITCHARD charges into the farmhouse as the FIRST GI follows him

INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

PRITCHARD looms over the RADIO OPERATOR

PRITCHARD

PRITCHARD

BOOOOOOOOM A shell hits outside ROCK is heading for the door

ROCK
Western slope is that right sir

PRITCHARD
Huh Hold on Sergeant youre

Bang The door slams behind ROCK leaving PRITCHARD with his mouth
open

BOOOOOOOOM Another shell hits outside as PRITCHARD steps to the
window He sees ROCK walking steadily toward the slope into the pass

PRITCHARD
Where the hell does he think hes
going

The FIRST GI and GORYL look uneasy as PRITCHARD opens the door and
shouts at ROCK

PRITCHARD
Sergeant Sergeant Rock Get your
ass back here Pronto

ROCK keeps walking

PRITCHARD
(turning to Goryl)
Lieutenant I want that man back
here Get him back here on the
double

GORYL
Right away sir

GORYL hastens out the door
ON THE SLOPE

BOOOOOOOOM A shell hits on the ridge as ROCK fifty yards from the
farmhouse starts down the slope into the woods

GORYL pants after him shouting

GORYL
Sergeant Hey Sergeant

ROCK keeps walking even as GORYL pants up to him and continues at his
side breathlessly

GORYL
Sergeant the Major wants us back
there Hes ordering us back to HQ

ROCK
(without breaking stride)
I cant hear him sir Its the
shells

BOOOOOM Another shell hits on the ridge as ROCK continues without
looking back leaving GORYL to stare after him flabbergasted

WOODSMOMENTS LATER

Fifty yards down the slope ROCK is in the woods now alert for signs
of the enemy scanning the confusion of trees when footsteps behind him
cause him to turn GORYL draws alongside him rifle in hand

GORYL
I couldnt hear him either

CUT TO

THE ROAD FROM BERGAMO

A jeep is winding through the slopes not yet in sight of the
FarmhouseHQ CAPTAIN SLOAN is at the wheel All we see of the man
beside him is a helmet with three stars on it The GENERALS face is
obscured in profile and the shadow of his helmet

Shells are thundering into the woods just ahead of them

SLOAN
(slowing down)
I think were getting kind of close
actually sir

WHOOM As if to confirm the statement a shell explodes only a couple
of hundred yards from the road The GENERAL doesnt flinch He speaks
sardonically still in shadowy profile his helmet more in evidence
than his face

GENERAL
Dont like shooting Captain
SLOAN

(bristling)
No sir I dont like it and I dont
know anybody who does Would the
General like to proceed with the
understanding that Major Pritchard
advises us he cannot guarantee the
Generals safetyand that the men
are already demoralized without losing
a General General

GENERAL
Fair enough Captain I withdraw the
comment

HONK HONK SLOAN and the GENERAL (his face still obscured) turn to
see a Troop Carrier looming behind them on the road eager to pass

INSIDE THE REAR OF THE TROOP CARRIER

MORGAN a cook is sitting on top of the same confusion of cooking
equipment GORYL rode in on peering ahead around the canvas roof and
speaking to several other COOKS lost in the gloom in the back

MORGAN
Christ almighty The assholes
honking a General off the road

COOKS VOICE (0OS)
So fucking what Theyre useless
bastards Generals You could have
all the wars you want without
Generals but you cant have shit
without food Generals are useless
we aint

INSIDE THE JEEP
CAPTAIN SLOAN is pulling off the road to let the troop carrier by

SLOAN
Cooks Theyre gonna try and give ‘em
a hot meal up on the line at Major
Pritchards request

The Troop Carrier is grinding by the DRIVER saluting the CAPTAIN and
the GENERAL whos still obscured by the angle

GENERAL
Lets get out of here The men would
rather see a hot meal than a General
any

SLOAN shouts as the sound of an incoming shell crescendos

SLOAN
GENERAL JUMP FOR IT

BAAAAAAAAAAWHOPOOOOOOOOOOOM THE SHELL HITS FULL FRAME OBSCURING
THE JEEP AS THE TROOP CARRIER GRINDS PAST AND WE

FIFTH FOXHOLE

The rain is coming down fiercely now as TEXAS watches WILDMAN scramble
into their foxhole machinegun bullets sizzling above them

TEXAS

WILDMAN
How do I know am I a medic Hes

TEXAS

WILDMAN

WILDMAN and TEXAS are glaring at each other as we

CUT TO
MEADOW DUSK
The rain is pouring down on a tiny hut apparently abandoned ina
meadow on the fringe of the woods as ROCK and GORYL appear slogging
through the meadow toward the woods A machinegun rattles in the wood

ahead and GORYL reacts nervously That gun isnt too far away and hes
scared now

ROCK
Kraut gun

GORYL
H-how do you know

ROCK

GORYL

ROCK

INTERIORFARMHOUSENIGHT

PRITCHARD peeks out between the curtains that cover the window He
cant see anything rain is slashing at the window He turns to the
weary looking FIRST GI slumped by the door

PRITCHARD
Private I want you to go out and
check our positions make sure
everyones on their toes

The FIRST GI blinks in disbelief then climbs reluctantly to his feet
his tone almost openly hostile

FIRST GI
Right sir

PRITCHARD
Theyve stopped shelling That could
mean theyre approaching it could
mean

RADIO OPERATORS VOICE (0OS)
Sir Orders from Battalion HQ sir
Colonel Cronkite

PRITCHARD turns abruptly and heads for the radio where the RADIO
OPERATOR sits wearing headphones

PRITCHARD

PRITCHARD breathes a sigh of relief and turns toward the FIRST GI
PRITCHARD
All right were gonna get the fuck

WHAM The door bursts open interrupting PRITCHARD in midsentence
PRITCHARDS eyes bulge and his jaw sags at what he sees in the doorway

Dripping wet in the doorway is an angry looking MAN of about fifty
grizzled and grayingSTARK NAKED EXCEPT FOR COMBAT BOOTS AND A HELMET

Everybody in the room is staring in disbelief when PRITCHARD
suddenly notices that there are three stars on the NAKED MANS
helmet PRITCHARD hesitates then still slack-jawed tentatively
comes to attention and salutes like a man afraid not to
The NAKED MAN brusquely returns the salute as we

CUT TO
WOODSNIGHT
Its pitch black pouring rain when suddenly a flare whooshes and
bursts overhead illuminating the woods in a spooky green light
catching WILDMAN running low
BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA the German machineguns open up spraying
bullets as WILDMAN dives flat on his belly and squirms and wriggles the
rest of the way toward the foxhole

CHATTA CHATTA CHATTA CHATTA The BAR responds firing a burst at the
winking muzzle of the German machinegun as the flare fades overhead

FIFTH FOXHOLE

TEXAS is firing his M-1 at the German guns as WILDMAN tumbles into the
watery foxhole

WILDMAN
Dont waste rounds
TEXAS
I was covering you

WILDMAN
You cant see em you cant hit em

TEXAS
What about Pardee Is he alive

For a long moment WILDMAN doesnt answer The guns have stopped firing

voice

WILDMAN

THIRD FOXHOLENIGHT

Barely visible in the rainy darkness WHIPSNAKE is poking KLUZEWSKI
awake

WHIPSNAKE
You awake Klu Its your watch

KLUZEWSKI stirs grunts sits up in the darkness while WHIPSNAKE
shields a flashlight as he tries to make a bed for himself under a
poncho that half roofs the hole

KLUZEWSKI
There oughtta be a flag you could wave
when you gotta take a crap Like a
time out

WHIPSNAKE
This is a war not a basketball game

light)

KLUZEWSKI
I dont have to crap anyway I didnt

WHIPSNAKE
Shuddup and lemme sleep

Silence

Rain pours down
A long moment then WHOOOSH A flare bursts overhead turning the
woods a spooky yellow revealing KLUZEWSKI in the foxhole and WHIPSNAKE
beside him already asleep under the poncho

KLUZEWSKI stares at the brightly lit woods Nothing moves Theres no
sound except the thrashing rain Its very spooky almost surreal

Nervously KLUZEWSKI whispers loud in the direction of the other
foxholes

KLUZEWSKI
Sssssst Wildman
(no answer)
Retread Hey Retread
Nothing Its like KLUZEWSKI is all alone in the world as the light
from the flare diminishes but instead of fading entirely remains a
gloomy yellow giving the woods a creepy glow

KLUZEWSKI is uneasy as he sits back in the foxholeand stiffens
suddenly as his hand touches something

He looks Theres something in the wall of the foxhole buried in the
mud

Tentatively he touches it wiping away mud and seesA HUMAN HAND

For a moment KLUZEWSKI stares at it in horror Its a small hand as
if a woman or child were buried in the mudnot too long ago

IT MOVES

No Impossible It must be an illusion something to do with the
continuing weird yellow afterglow of the flare

IT REALLY MOVES WRITHING EXPOSING A DELICATE WRIST

Without taking his eyes off the horrifying phenomenon KLUZEWSKI hisses
urgently at WHIPSNAKE

KLUZEWSKI
Whip Whip wake up Whip

WHIPSNAKE doesnt stir

KLUZEWSKI forgets to say anything more as hypnotized he watches an
arm emerge from the mud and then a face covered with mud A WOMANS
FACE

Bug-eyed KLUZEWSKI sees the hand wipe mud from the face

KLUZEWSKI
Angie Jesus Christ

ANGIE is squirming out of the muddy wall of the foxhole a lithe young
woman of twenty-three stark naked She gives an apologetic little
laugh
ANGIE

KLUZEWSKI
Angie Angie this is fucking Italy

ANGIE

KLUZEWSKI casts a frantic glance at WHIPSNAKE whos still sound

Its a small foxhole theres nowhere to go ANGIE has a hand on
KLUZEWSKIS crotch The rain is washing the mud off her revealing her
firm breasts her alabaster skin her wet black hair Shes moving the
hand gently speaking in a breathy intimate voice

ANGIE
Remember that time when the kids were
out backwhen we did it on the
kitchen floor

KLUZEWSKI
(sudden alarm)

ANGIE
(rubbing against him)
With your parents Come ooooooon

The GERMAN SOLDIERS are crouched behind their machinegun cold and
businesslike As two GERMANS drag the wounded screaming GERMAN
SOLDIER into their position the CAPTAIN snaps an order The GERMAN

SOLDIER is silenced immediately These guys mean business

PLOP A grenade flops stupidly in front of them a silly little
pineapple of iron

The CAPTAIN looks at it it registers in his mindthen it explodes

the already ravaged GERMAN SOLDIERS as we

WHIPSNAKE

WILDMAN is grim in the moonlight as BIGELOW says aloud what all of them
are thinking

BIGELOW
He didnt get ‘em they got him

GORYL is worried but he forces himself to take charge

GORYL
Come on men lets keep moving

WILDMAN

WILDMAN hesitates his eyes meeting GORYLS GORYL looks away
PASCALANO

GORYL is moving ahead and the others are falling in behind him
WILDMAN hesitates then follows

PASCALANO
Bullshit Not Baker Fucking Rock

GERMAN POSITION

The machinegun spatters bullets into the moonlit woods where GERMAN
VOICES exchange urgent shouts

ROCK is behind the gun blazing away finishing off a belt Beside him
in a pool of blood a badly INJURED GERMAN speaks to him

INJURED GERMAN
(German subtitled)
Give me more medicine For the pain

ROCK
(German subtitled)
I gave you all I had

Having failed to find another ammo belt ROCK is hastily grabbing some
German grenades and other gear

INJURED GERMAN

(German subtitled)

How come you talk German without an
accent

ROCK
(German subtitled)
My parents came from the Ruhr

INJURED GERMAN

(German subtitled)

TEXAS is moving cautiously back through the meadow to where GORYL and

the rest of Easy are waiting tensely

TEXAS

GORYL

More grumbling BEEF murmurs to RETREAD
BEEF

RIDGEOUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSENIGHT

Crouched behind a machinegun outside the farmhouse three
are sharing a quick smoke hiding the single cigarette in
the glow wont give them away

SECOND GI
Naked Bare ass

FIRST GI
Fucking aye Bare fucking ass Boots
and a helmet is all

THIRD GI
A helmet with three stars

FIRST GI
He says his jeep got shelled gasoline
all over his uniform Took it off so
he wouldnt catch fire

THIRD GI
Poor bastard was out there in the
woods buck naked for about three
hours

SECOND GI
General Cook huh I never hearda

weary GIS

FIRST GI
(imitating)
Cook Third Division gimme that
uniform private

SECOND GI
(incredulous)
He took your fucking uniform

FIRST GI

SECOND GI
It makes you wonder sometimes if this
is a war or a comedy

FIRST GI
Comedy my ass That bastard aint
funny unless getting killed is ha-ha
You know what hes doing hes in
there telling Pritchard were gonna
stick it out The dumb shit wants
to attack hes calling for support

INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

PRITCHARD looks agitated as GENERAL COOK wearing an ill-fitted
privates uniform harangues him

COOK
You get your man to repeat the order
I want at least a dozen howitzers I
want Long Toms I want air support
and I want six rifle companies by

PRITCHARD
General I dont think you quite grasp
our situation here By the time any
support arrives well already be --

COOK interrupts leaping to his feet waving his arms theatrically and
declaiming loudly

COOK
Then up spoke brave Horatius the
Captain of the gate To all the men

upon this earth death cometh soon or
late And how can man die better than
by facing fearful odds for the ashes
of his fathers and the temples of his
gods

Stunned PRITCHARD can only stammer while everybody in the room stares
at the General completely non-plussed
PRITCHARD
Iuh I beg yourpardon General

COOK

Tennyson You didnt learn Tennyson
at The Point Major Goddamn pity

(to the amazed GIs)
Of course we dont believe in all
that crap about ashes of fathers and
temples of gods thats Greek stuff
but we believe in our families our
loved ones our country and Jesus
Christand our men down in that
pass

PRITCHARD
General thats very emotional stuff
about fearful odds but as you
know sir wars are won with tactics
and

COOK

Hew down the bridge Sir Consul
with all the speed ye may and I with
two to help me will hold the foe at
bay

(triumphantly)
For in yon straight path a thousand
may well be stopped by three now who
will stand on either hand and fight
the foe with me

(to everyone)
Thats your tactics It was a bridge
see Narrow like that pass down
there The idea was three men could
stand off an army of thousandsand
they did Thats called tactics mitt
balls got that

PRITCHARD
General our situation is very serious
and I dont think we should discuss
this in front of

COOK
Whats that

COOK has suddenly noticed some cans piled under a shelf in the corner
which hes pointing at

RADIO OPERATOR
Looks like paint sir

COOK
(inspecting)
Paint What kind of paint
PRITCHARD
I imagine its Italian paint General
it was here when we established HQ
I wonder if we could continue our
discussion of tactics in private so
that

COOK
Its white paint

COOK has opened a can and dipped his finger in as we

CUT TO

HUT MEADOWNIGHT

Squatting in a moonlit meadow the little peasant hut looks ominous
to GORYL and the men of Easy who are eyeing it warily from a safe
distance PASCALANO expresses almost universal sentiments as he
mutters under his breath

PASCALANO
I was beginning to think it didnt
exist

GORYL
(ignoring the remark
bravely)
The Sergeant and I checked it out this
afternoon Its abandoned

RETREAD
Yeah I smell smoke

BEEF
Me too
GORYL
(decisively)
Im gonna look it over I needa
volunteer to go with me

GORYL finds himself looking into battle-hardened faces men who dont
volunteerespecially not for green lieutenants No response

Hiding his own fear GORYL consider the tough faces one by one Then
he points

GORYL
You Lets go

Without waiting for WILDMAN to answer GORYL starts toward the hut
With a shrug WILDMAN falls in behind him

The others watch the two of them move stealthily toward the hut
BEEF
Ill say this for the Lieutenant hes
goin himself he didnt send two of
us

RETREAD
Thats cause hes so fucking green
hes more scared of us than the
krauts Hell learn

CLOSE TO THE HUT

WILDMAN moves cautiously to a window then turns and hisses to
GORYL

WILDMAN
Windows covered with something

GORYL hides his trembling hands as he whispers

GORYL
Cover me Im going in

WILDMAN is actually impressed He looks GORYL in the eye

WILDMAN
I got more experience sir I could
go in

GORYL
I need more experience Cover me

WILDMAN stands by the door as GORYL suddenly shoves it open
INSIDE THE HUT

As GORYL drops in low a gun muzzle touches his temple
FORTY YARDS AWAY

BEEF RETREAD and the others watch breathlessly as WILDMAN follows
GORYL in through the door

The men wait tensely for a shot or something
Suddenly WILDMAN appears and approaches the anxious men somberly
WILDMAN
Sergeant Rock is preparing a light
repast of hot K rations and he wonders
if we would care to dine with him
PASCALANO
Whatd I tell you The bastard cant

die hes superhuman

MEADOW DAWN
The hut is a glum silhouette against the weak light coming from the
east where the rising sun is obscured by clouds BIGELOWS breath
comes in puffs of steam as he stands watch outside the hut holding his
hand out to collect the first flakes of snow thats beginning to fall
almost imperceptibly

INSIDE THE HUT

The men of Easy huddled on the floor are just beginning to stir
PASCALANO is seeing to PARDEES needs while ROCK passes out another
round of K rations from his pack

TEXAS
That true what Whip said about the
hospital The Krauts bombed it

ROCK
(a grim shrug)
It coulda been an accident

PARDEE
It killed Goines right Chopper was
probably there too and Fortuna

BEEF
Some accident

RETREAD
Well I guess we gotta stop being nice
to the Germans right fellas No

WILDMAN

KLUZEWSKI
(looking out the window)
Its snowing out

BEEF

PASCALANO
Any countrys gonna be shit when its
winter an people are shooting at you

ROCK
Lieutenant with your permission Id
like to take a couple of men and scout
ahead to make sure they didnt get
behind us make sure we got a clear
way to fall back

Everybody looks at ROCK then at GORYL like at a tennis match
GORYL
Right Thats a good idea Sergeant

ROCK
While were scouting sir you might

want to distribute the mail

Everybody gasps as ROCK produces the bundle of letters from his pack
and we

CUT TO

THE MEADOWMOMENTS LATER

ROCK RETREAD and WHIPSNAKE are moving across the meadow away from the
hut as snow flutters in the air not yet sticking to the ground

RETREAD
You picked us cause we didnt get no
mail right

ROCK
I didnt look Its gonna be tough
hauling Pardee on the high ground
Lets check the pass see what we see

RETREAD
You know I dont ever get mail Whip

RETREAD
Just because nobody writes us is no
reason for us to pull extra duty
Sergeant

ROCK
Well mark trees to make sure we can
find our way back

INSIDE THE HUT

GORYL is pulling envelopes from the sack of mail

GORYL
Jones William

An awkward silence exchange of glances then

KLUZEWSKI

GORYL
Oh Uh sorry UhBlake Thomas
Another silence
GORYL

GORYL pulls out another letter
GORYL

PASCALANO

BEEF

Another silence then
WILDMAN

Lieutenant
GORYL

Yes Good idea Corporal

WILDMAN takes the stack of letters He looks at the top one then sets
it aside solemnly Then the next And the next

Its a grim moment the room is full of the ghosts of dead men
Until

WILDMAN
Here ya go Klu

As KLUZEWSKI takes the letter eagerly PASCALANO breathes a sigh of
relief

PASCALANO
Thank Christ I was thinking maybe
none of us were alive

WOODSSNOW

Snow is falling fast and furiously now sticking to the bare branches
several inches deep on the ground obscuring everything muffling
sound

ROCK RETREAD and WHIPSNAKE appear plodding through the snow ROCK is
peering around at the woods The snow has cut his visibility to thirty
yards
ROCK
Were not gonna learn anything more
We better get back

RETREAD
While we can I hope you know the way

RETREAD is considering the fresh blanket of snow behind them the
mysterious woods

CRACK CRACK Sharp snapping sounds in the distance All three of
them stiffen WHIPSNAKE looks puzzled

WHIPSNAKE
Rifles

RETREAD
Not M-ls Maybe Italian rifles or
something

ROCK frowns as he listens He knows what they are

ROCK
Trees

WHIPSNAKE
Trees

INSIDE THE HUT

Looking disturbed KLUZEWSKI is studying the contents of his letter
with a frown when BEEFS triumphant shout causes him to look up

Everybodys looking at BEEF whos gleefully holding up a crude
ladderback chair and punching out the straw seat

BEEF
Looka this willya Looka what I got
A fucking toilet Im gonna take a
shit like a human being Im gonna
take a proper fucking crap

WILDMAN
Seconds

PASCALANO
Thirds

TEXAS
Next

BIGELOW
After Texas

PASCALANO

Whatsa matter Kluzewski you
constipated or you got to like
squatting

KLUZEWSKI is completely preoccupied with a photo enclosed with his
lettera picture of his wife ANGIE and his two kids Pretty ANGIE
smiles at him from the picture with love and innocence (in sharp
contrast to the horny slut from his dreams) as he answers absently

KLUZEWSKI
Yeah yeah count me in

PASCALANO
(to Goryl)
This is a democracy here on the line
Lieutenant no officers latrine

GORYL
Fair enough Im last

PARDEE
He oughtta go outside hes gonna

WILDMAN
Who could smell it We all stink so
bad we cant smell anything but

TEXAS

PASCALANO
Worse than animals Animals clean

PARDEE

Thats what so great about women you

WILDMAN
That isnt all thats so great about

Nobody laughs at WILDMANS joke theyre serious
TEXAS
Paskys right Even the dirty ones

PARDEE
They smell like soap

PASCALANO
Or clean sheets
GORYL
Their hair especially

Surprised looks Nobody expected GORYL the stranger to speak
Then KLUZEWSKI looks up dreamily from Mother Angies smile

KLUZEWSKI
Yeah Their hair

Everybodys silent for a moment thinking clean thoughts

BBBBRRRRRRAT A loud farting noise from BEEFS direction breaks the
mood

WILDMAN
I believe we got artillery support
after all

TANKS WOODS

CRAAACK SNAP CRACK Trees break like twigs as two tanks Panzers
ghostly in the snowy air grind through the woods ominously

ROCK RETREAD and WHIPSNAKE are crouched behind a tree twenty yards
away watching the tanks

ROCK is grim

ROCK
Lets go

The three men move from behind the rock and start hastily back through
the woods as the tanks continue through the trees

Moving through the thickly falling snow their vision obscured they
weave among the trees

ROCK is looking around with a frown

ROCK
There Theres one of our marks

ROCK is indicating a crude slash in one of the trees Hes about to
look for the next one when

CRACK SNAP Directly in front of them the sound of a tank coming
still a ways off

WHIPSNAKE
Aw shit

ROCK
This way

ROCK heads decisively in another direction as we
CUT TO

SNOWWOODSMOMENTS LATER

Leading them in the other direction ROCK suddenly hears the snarling
engine of a tank ahead of himnot too far But he cant see the
tankin fact he cant see more than ten feet in the thickly falling
snow Hastily the three men turn back moving away from the snarl of
the engine

But seconds later another engine growls even closer to them forcing
them to change direction again

The engines get louderso loud the roaring seems to surround them
WHIPSNAKE and RETREAD look to ROCK for guidance Which way do they go
ROCK doesnt know

SUDDENLY A TANK APPEARSA HUGE BLACK THING LOOMING OUT OF THE
OF SNOW ONLY FIFTEEN FEET AWAY

All three men scramble out of the way as the huge tank grinds within a
few feet of them apparently never seeing them

But WHIPSNAKE is pointing in alarm

Here comes another ten yards from them Its machinegun starts to
chatter

ROCK
SPLIT UP

ROCK dives out of the way to the left of the tank WHIPSNAKE and
RETREAD sprawl in the other direction

Half crawling half running ROCK scrambles away from the tank

And scrambles almost under the treads of another as it suddenly appears
out of the whiteness

Escaping the treads ROCK sees the flash of machinegun fire from
another tanks invisible in the snow

It must be shooting at RETREAD and WHIPSNAKE

ROCK pulls a grenade and moves through the blinding snow deafened by
roaring engines

Suddenly hes ten feet from the profile of a tank as it grinds forward
firing

ROCK flips the grenade into the treads and dives flat on his face
KA-BLAAAAAM The grenade explodes

ROCK looks up The tank rumbles ahead apparently oblivious
And suddenly another tank rumbles out of the snow only a few feet away
about to run over him

ROCK scrambles to his feet and sprints off into the snow as the
machineguns chatter behind him

Gasping for air he keeps running putting distance between the
throbbing engines and himself as we

CUT TO

ROCKMINUTES LATER

Still staggering forwards sucking wind ROCK looks back He cant see
anything through the snow but he can still hear the tanks grumbling
toward him a quarter mile back

WHAM ROCK slams into something directly in front of him A wall

Shaking his head clear ROCK finds himself looking at the muzzle of
TEXAS rifle

TEXAS
Sarge You okay Whats going on
Those tanks are trucks or what

ROCK
Tanks Get inside

As ROCK and TEXAS disappear into the hut wind blows the curtain of
snow momentarily clear revealing four tanks only a hundred yards away
grinding slowly toward the hut with GERMAN FOOTSOLDIERS moving behind
them

INSIDE THE HUT
TEXAS is peeking out the side window
TEXAS
Shit Its letting up the winds

blowing the snow away

GORYL
We cant fight tanks

ROCK
I think we should sit tight theres
a chance theyll go right past us

The engines are getting louder

GORYL
Good idea Sergeant I --

TEXAS
No it aint Hit the deck
TEXAS whos been peering through the window dives for the floor and
everybody else follows suit

TANK TURRET

From behind the turning tank turret we see the big gun on the lead tank
line up with the hut a hundred yards aheadaiming

KA BLAAAAAM The big gun blasts A direct hit demolishes the hut
The tank continues to rumble toward the crumpled hut

INSIDE THE RUBBLE

ROCK pokes his head out of the clutter of debris spots the tank coming
toward the hut now only 70 yards away and starts to struggle free

GORYL TEXAS WILDMAN KLUZEWSKI and PASCALANO are scrambling to their
feet covered with cuts and bruises as ROCK starts digging in the
debris

ROCK
Wheres Pardee Wheres Beef

WILDMAN
Wheres my rifle

TEXAS
Fuck your rifle

TEXAS is seeing the tank grinding right at them

BIGELOW
Help Im caught Me and Beef

BIGELOW and BEEF are underneath a collapsed wall and GORYL KLUZEWSKI
PASCALANO and TEXAS start digging them out as ROCK pulls aside debris
desperately looking for PARDEE

The tank is closermuch closer Machineguns rattle bullets sizzle
in the debris

ROCK and GORYL pull a heavy board aside and reactunderneath is
PARDEE clearly dead

CRACK Ping CRACK Ping WILDMAN fires his M-1 at the tank now only
thirty-five yards away and the bullets ping off the armored surface as
machinegun bullets sizzle around WILDMAN

BEEF is clear his arm broken but BIGELOW is still trapped as GORYL
and ROCK join the others trying to free him

Pinned BIGELOW is able to maneuver enough to get one hand on his
lifesavers Frantic he spills two before he manages to get a hand to
his mouth with a red one
GORYL
I got him You guys take off

GORYL is still digging frantically as TEXAS turns and sees the tank
twenty yards away and comingcomingcoming

ROCK sees it too as he hurls aside debris freeing BIGELOW at last
but the tank is on them looming over them five yards away too late
to run too late to

KAAAABAAAAM A sudden explosion shudders the tank causing it to grind
to a violent stop canted part way up the heap of debris its menacing
treads only three feet from RDCK who stares in amazement

KAAAA-BOOOM A second bazooka shell slams into the immobilized tanks
turret penetrating heavy armor Smoke pours from the badly damaged
tank and someone screams from inside

As the others stare in dumbfounded amazement ROCK looking left spots
several phantom SOLDIERS barely visible a hundred and fifty yards away
at the edge of the woods Ghostly figures in the falling snow they
seem to be wearing dark masks and one of them has a bazooka Then
like apparitions they disappear into the woods

ROCK
Everybody down the krauts dont see
us

Crouched behind the debris and the burning tank ROCK GORYL and the
others watch the other tanks turn abruptly toward the woods to the
left machineguns rattling as they pursue the PHANTOM SOLDIERS

TEXAS
Sonofabitch

WILDMAN
Bazooka

BIGELOW
Helluva shot

GORYL

(to Rock)

Who

ROCK

I dunno sir

ROCKS thoughtful eyes follow the tanks as they grind into the woods
with GERMAN FOOTSOLDIERS in their wake

CUT TO
WOODSLATER

Its still snowing piling up on the ground and covering the tree
branches as WILDMAN moves cautiously among the trees rifle ready
Hes the point man about thirty yards ahead of the rest of the ragged
band

GORYL and PASCALANO are next then BEEF whos wearing his left arm in
sling then ROCK carrying the BAR followed by TEXAS and finally
KLUZEWSKI whos bringing up the rear

Ahead in the distance a machinegun rattles then rifles crack and the
deep thud of a flat trajectory gun sounds

GORYL drops back to be close to ROCK

GORYL
That machinegunits slower

ROCK
One of ours
GORYL
You dont think maybe were getting
support
ROCK
(dubious)

That Major said there was another

cold All they can see are trees

flat trajectory shells

WHIPSNAKE
(suddenly)
Hey Wheres Pardee

CUT TO
WOODSLATER

The snow has stopped falling The ten men of Easy are moving single
file through the snowy woods RETREAD in front WILDMAN watching the
rear walking backward much of the time

BEEF
(to Whipsnake)
The thing about the colored is theyre
quitters when things get tough they
run

WHIPSNAKE
Well at least they didnt quit before

BEEF
Im just saying what I heard is all
I never met no colored people

ROCK just ahead of the Lieutenant is scanning the terrain to the
right and left He spots something and looking back indicates what
he sees to GORYL
GORYL follows the look and sees broken trees fifty yards to the left
ROCK
Theyre going to the pass We should

move up on the slope to avoid them

GORYL is nodding agreement when ROCK stiffens Up ahead RETREAD is
signalling

Everybody halts

RETREAD makes a hand signal indicating for ROCK to come forward as
we

CUT TO

ARAVINESECONDS LATER

An overturned Panzer lies blackened and smoldering in the ravine
Several GERMAN SOLDIERS lie face down in the snow

ROCK GORYL and RETREAD are on the lip of the ravine looking down at
the ruined tank in awe

RETREAD
(a black voice)
Siiiilk
ROCK looks impressed as we
CUT TO
FARMHOUSERIDGE
Huge white letters on the wall of the farmhouse say
KRAUTS LIKE WEINIES
USA ALL THE WAY
and incomplete

EAT SHIT ADOL

The FIRST SECOND and THIRD GIS are working on the P and H for Adolph
buckets of white paint at hand

FIRST GI
This is nuts
SECOND GI
Youre telling me its nuts

A shell screams overhead and explodes 500 yards beyond

FIRST GI
If it was just the Major Id tell him
to blow it out his ass

THIRD GI
Suuuure you would

FIRST GI
but that fucking General Im not
crossing that General

THIRD GI
General Bare Ass

Thirty yards away COOK lowers the binoculars and starts back to the
farmhouse as another shell explodes a thousand yards away

The GIS are considering the completed EAT SHIT ADOLPH as COOK strides
past

COOK
Looks good men

FIRST GI
Uh what should we write next sir

COOK
Think of a good one How about

Mussolini is a cocksucker

As COOK continues to the farmhouse door the three GIS exchange
glances

FIRST GI
Who can spell Mussolini

SECOND GI
Who can spell cocksucker

INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

PRITCHARD and the RADIO OPERATOR hovering over the radio look up as
COOK enters scowling

COOK
Tanks

PRITCHARD
(alarmed)

Tanks

COOK
I saw at least two of them just
glimpsed them

PRITCHARD
We cant fight tanks General

COOK
There was some kind of skirmish the
men must be taking them on

PRITCHARD
General Its just a handful of
colored boys and whats left of Easy
They cant --

COOK
Brave bastards Real fighters Did
you request artillery

PRITCHARD
Yessir

COOK
You said General Cook wants full air
support General Cook wants arty
including twenty howitzers and Long
Toms General Cook wants --

PRITCHARD
-- six rifle companies and armored
support I requested everything per
your instructions but Generaleven
if they come through with the support
itll be too late well be overrun by --

COOK looms very close to PRITCHARD cutting him off in a heavy
whisper

COOK
Shut up Pritchard youll rattle the
men

With a meaningful glance COOK indicates the RADIO OPERATOR to
PRITCHARD then he turns and starts for the door grabbing a bucket of
paint from the floor and pointing out a second bucket to PRITCHARD

COOK
Come on Major lets help with the
painting

PRITCHARD hoists the bucket of paint and starts after COOK
complaining

PRITCHARD
I dont understand the point of the
painting General

COOK
(exiting)
Morale Major Its not good to sit
around on your ass thinking about
dying Much better to be standing on
your feet saying Fuck you

Paint bucket in hand PRITCHARD follows COOK out the door with a weary
Right sir of course as another shell hits in the woods shaking the
farmhouse

SLOPING WOODSDAY

ROCK and the men from Easy are warily making their way through woods
that slope steeply forming part of the west wall of the pass
Exhausted they move cautiously haunted by the threat of demon
snipers

POP POP Everybody stiffens at the sound of distant shots

The sounds come from below in the pass The men move lower on the
slope where the woods give way to steep boulder walls that line the
pass the to the floor

Looking down from the steep rocky slope ROCK and GORYL see six tanks
growling into the throat of the pass below with fifty GERMAM
FOOTSOLDIERS moving in their wake

BLAAAAAM The lead tank fires its cannon and its machineguns clatter

GORYL
Whore they shooting at

ROCK spots an AMERICAN SOLDIER far below scampering among the rocks
near the foot of the slope ahead of the tank Then ANOTHER SOLDIER
appears and disappears just as quickly between boulders

RETREAD BEEF and the others are gathered behind ROCK and GORYL
watching Nobody says anything nobody answers GORYL as the drama

below unfolds

BLAAAM The lead tank fires another round as it growls toward the edge
of the slope where ROCK glimpsed the two GIS

WHOOOOOOMP The moving tank suddenly shudders and grinds to a halt

RETREAD
Yeah Siiiiilk

BEEF
(impressed)

Sonofabitch

WHOOOOOMP A second bazooka shell slams into the Panzer and smoke
pours from the wounded immobilized beast

CHATTA CHATTA CHATTA The patter of a machinegun sends GERMAN
FOOTSOLDIERS diving for cover

TEXAS
What the fuck are they doing

GORYL
(to Rock)
Its Baker The same men

ROCK
Yeah It must be

ROCKS eyes never leave the action below Hes impressed

CHATTA CHATTA CHATTA The GERMANS are pinned down but theyre up to
something

ROCK watches two squads of GERMAN SOLDIERS assembling out of sight of
the BAKER SOLDIERS

A sudden huge noise focusses everybodys attention on the opposite wall
of the pass where a landslide of massive boulders surges down the
slope ROCK and the others watch in astonishment as the big rocks
together with the ruined tank form a string of beads across the
throat of the pass making the pass impassable for the other tanks

TEXAS
They blocked it They blocked the
pass

BIGELOW
Sonofabitch

ROCKS jaw is set like stone his eyes glowing with admiration as all
around him his comrades speak in awed tones

WILDMAN
Those sonofabitches

KLUZEWSKI
God damn

RETREAD
Tough outfit I could see that

BEEF
The krautsll just blow those rocks
out with some charges

WHIPSNAKE
Maybe so but those colored took out
three tanks so far and theyre slowing
em down to put charges in All were
doin is runnin’

TEXAS sees what ROCK sees two SQUADS of GERMAN SOLDIERS moving up the
rocky slope of the pass to get above and behind the BAKER SOLDIERS who
are low on the slope in the neck of the pass

TEXAS
They better start runnin pretty
quick

ROCK hesitates then makes up his mind and makes a head movement
indicating he wants to talk to GORYL privately

As the two men move away RETREAD sees them go and shakes his head
sardonically

RETREAD
Christ Almighty Whaddaya wanna bet
Rocks talking the Lieutenant Girl
into taking a couple volunteers and
shooting up that kraut ambush unit
Its hero time again

TEXAS
(looking down)
Shit they gotta be crazy they aint
backin up

TEN YARDS AWAY
ROCK and GORYL are deep in conversation

GORYL
Were supposed to be pulling back
were heavily outnumbered

ROCK
Myself and two men only at risk We
slip fifty yards down the slope snipe
at that outfit make em dig in and
hide Maybe we wound a couple slow
them down That alerts Baker and
gives them some time to get the hell
out

GORYL
(struggling)
Sergeant you and I have a
responsibility to get our men out of
here These colored guys are being
veryheroic Maybe foolhardy
Maybe foolishly heroic

ROCK
So lets give them a chance to save
their ass like they did for us Give
them some running room Three of us
sir

BACK TO THE OTHERS

BEEF and WHIPSNAKE are heavily into a dialogue

WHIPSNAKE
Bullshit

BEEF
It happened to a guy He was in this
car accident they take him to the
hospital they give him colored blood
by accident

KLUZEWSKI
An his kids come out colored

WHIPSNAKE
How do ya know it was from the blood

BEEF
How else is he gonna get a colored
kid

The question is so profoundly stupid everybodys too dumbfounded to
answer And then GORYL appears

GORYL
The Sergeant wants volunteers

RETREAD
Whatd I tell ya

GORYL
He wants to attack the Germans below
us and withdraw immediately

WILDMAN
(a shrug)
Im on
KLUZEWSKI
(ultra casual)
Ill go
PASCALANO
Me too

CUT TO

THE STEEP SLOPEMOMENTS LATER

ROCK is in the lead WILDMAN behind him then KLUZEWSKI and PASCALANO
all of them struggling among boulders trying not to dislodge loose
rocks that could tip off the GERMANS below and to their left

KLUZEWSKI
How come I thought you were against
this
PASCALANO
Iam I just figure Im better off
attackin Rome with Rock than walking
through the fucking woods with
Wonder-Goryl

ROCK stops

ROCK
Hold it Right here Theyll pass
between those two boulders down there
see When I say fire we open up we
might hit as many as four men

WILDMAN
Then what

ROCK
We fire a few rounds keep em honest
then we withdraw

ABOVE THE RIM

GORYL and the others are looking down They can just barely see ROCKs
positionand they can catch brief glimpses of GERMANS scrambling
between boulders intent on encircling BAKER unaware theyre moving
into an ambush themselves

Gunfire from the pass below and to the right causes them to look and
see a GERMAN SOLDIER tiny in the distance sprawled face down while
two other tiny GERMANS scurry for cover

RETREAD
Demolition team trying to get to the
rocks and blow em up

TEXAS
And Baker aint lettin em do it

BIGELOW
Those bastards they really hang
tough

WHIPSNAKE

Thats how we were at Kassarene

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA Sudden fire right below them They all look
down and see GERMAN SOLDIERS being cut down between two boulders

AMONG THE BOULDERS BELOW

ROCK PASCALANO WILDMAN and KLUZEWSKI are firing in a fury as GERMAN
SOLDIERS scream and dive bloodily for cover One bloody GERMAN is
facing down and motionless another is crawling desperately to get
behind a boulder Another out of view is screaming

ROCK
We hit three for sure

WILDMAN
Five I think

CRACK KLUZEWSKI fires a single shot into the crawling GERMAN

KLUZEWSKI
For Pardee ya kraut pig

Below them GERMAN VOICES are shouting urgently Someone cries out in
pain

PASCALANO
Whatre they saying Sarge

ROCK
(deadpan)
Theyre unhappy

KLUZEWSKI
No shit

More urgent GERMAN VOICES below

ROCK
They dont like us

PASCALANO
Aaaawwww

ROCK

Or our mothers

PASCALANO
Shit Our mothers Really they

A sudden angry profane burst of GERMAN below directed right at Easy
Everybody looks at ROCK

ROCK
(again deadpan)
Or our nigger Jew friends

A moment of silence then WILDMAN points to a slab of rock ten yards
below jutting out of the steep face of the slope

WILDMAN
Listen Sargesee that rock over
therejutting out If someone got
out there they could drop a grenade
right on top of those guys

ROCK
Someone
WILDMAN grins then indicates the pass off to the right

WILDMAN
Bakers still taking em on

ROCK
Go ahead Here

ROCK hands WILDMAN a grenade
WILDMAN
Mamapleeeeease Could I have two

cookies mama

ABOVE THE RIMMOMENTS LATER

GORYL frowns as he and the others see WILDMAN slipping among the
boulders

TEXAS
Wildman Wheres he goin

WILDMAN reaches the flat rock that juts out a little like a very wide
and long diving board They watch him go down on his belly and squirm

out toward the lip

WHIPSNAKE
Gonna deliver some fruit

BEEF
That well known dessert pineapple
pie

They all watch tensely as WILDMAN squirms out on the rock

WILDMANTHE OVERHANGING ROCK

WILDMAN holds a grenade in his hand and peeks over the lip of the rock

FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW WILDMAN sees GERMANS directly below him in
disarray Some are trying to squirm into position to return ROCKS
fire another is setting up a machinegun others attend two very badly
WOUNDED SOLDIERS and an OFFICER and RADIOMAN are huddled over a
portable radio speaking excitedly

WILDMAN pulls the pin on the grenade looks up and shouts toward the
sky

WILDMAN
HEY FARRACCI YOU WOP BASTARD
FARRACCI UP IN HEAVEN WATCH THIS

WILDMAN looks down now at the startled faces of GERMANS below looking
up at himand drops the grenade among them

WILDMAN
THATS FOR FARRACCI YOU DIRTY HUNS
THATS FOR THE DARING DAGO EAT IT
YOU NAZZEY ASSHOLES

BOOOOOOOOOM
ABOVE ON THE RIM

The blast and the screams drift upward as GORYLS attention is diverted
by RETREAD who taps his arm and points off to the left

Following RETREADS look GORYL spots movement among the boulders far
to the left Some members of the GERMAN SQUAD are moving to outflank
ROCKS position

RETREAD
Getting behind Rock

GORYL looks back toward ROCKS position in time to see WILDMAN yanking
the pin on the next grenade as he shouts

WILDMAN
YOU ASSHOLES DONT LIKE COLORED GUYS
HUH HERES ONE FOR THE COLORED G

BAWHOOOOOOOM GORYL and the others are horrified to see WILDMAN
suddenly rolling and writhing covered with blood his hands to his
face

WILDMAN
OH GOD OH CHRIST OH MY GOD
CHRIST ALMIGHTY IM HIT OH SHIT
IM HIT BAD OH CHRIST

GORYL
(stunned)
Whawhat

RETREAD
Goddamn short fuse Fuck

GORYL can see WILDMAN in agony on the promontory while ROCK and
PASCALANO move hastily toward him GORYL then quickly looks to the
left where again he spots UNIFORMS moving among the boulders out of
ROCKS sight encircling ROCKS position

GORYL is in an agony of indecision realizing the mess theyre suddenly
in

THE PROMONTORY BELOW

WILDMAN is screaming as ROCK and PASCALANO try to move him back off the
promontory GERMANS shout swearwords from below in response to
WILDMANS screams

ABOVE ON THE RIM
As WILDMAN screams below RETREAD is looking to GORYL whos watching
the boulders where GERMAN SOLDIERS are moving up the slope out of
ROCKS sight

RETREAD
We better warn Rock Lieutenant

GORYL looks to RETREAD and finds all of them looking at him Theyve
all seen the GERMANS

GORYL
No

Stone faces watch GORYL whos trembling sweating
GORYL

If we warn him we give away our
position and we leave Rock surrounded

anyway
BEEF
(hostile)
Yeah So whadda we gonna do
Lieutenant

GORYL doesnt even try to hide the fact that hes scared

GORYL
We m-move down w-we get p-position
on the krauts and wh-when they t-try
to ambush R-rock we b-beat the shit

Turning his back on them to avoid any challenge to his authority GORYL
moves immediately

BEEF rolls his eyes as he starts to follow

BEEF
If this is what its like to fall
back I dont wanna know whats an
attack

RETREAD
The bullshit is Rock gets us into
this then if we get out alive
Pascalanos gonna tell me how Rock

soldier with Rock we live forever we
got charmed lives

WHIPSNAKE
I got serious doubts about living
forever Retread Serious doubts

GORYL
(a loud whisper)
Sssssssst Keep quiet

Theyre all moving cautiously down the steep slope among boulders now
all of them scared as shells boom in the distance and WILDMAN screams

not very far away

AMONG THE BOULDERS

WILDMAN is sedated in shock ROCK is bandaging him

KLUZEWSKI
How the fuck do we get him back up
Sarge

ROCK

Carry him Gimme another bandage

PASCALANO is the lookout hes looking down where GERMANS are hidden
below catches sight of a flash of uniform and squeezes off a single
shot

CRACK CRACK Ping The GERMANS answer from below with two shots that
spang harmlessly off the boulders

ROCK
Okay lets go Klu you give me a
hand with WildmanPascalano watch
our ass

ROCK shoulders WILDMAN while KLUZEWSKI helps balance the load Then
they start to struggle up the slope PASCALANO keeping an eye on the

rear

Suddenly KLUZEWSKI glimpses movement ahead He shouts and shoves ROCK
violently forward

KLUZEWSKI
Hit it Sarge theyre above us

RATTA RATTA RATTA TATTA TATTAAautomatic fire splatters around them
from above

ROCK shoves WILDMAN against the face of a boulder and squeezes against
him trying to melt the two of them right into the stone

KLUZEWSKI is pressed under an overhang with about an inch of cover to
spare like ROCK

And PASCALANO is similarly pinned as bullets zing off the stone
surfaces inches away

ROCK
Klu You okay

KLUZEWSKI is squeezing his body away from bullets
KLUZEWSKI

S-so far

ROCK
Pascalano

PASCALANO
Im o

PASCALANO is replying when a German grenade the potato masher style
plops among the boulders two feet away For a quarter second he stares
at certain deaththen his foot shoots out and he kicks the grenade
down the slope

BOOOOOOOOM

PASCALANO
(shaking)
kay S-sergeant

KLUZEWSKI
What the hell are we gonna do Sarge
I cant move Im pinned

ROCK
Hang tight the Lieutenantll support

KLUZEWSKI

Hes a kid hell shit his pants
BRATTA BRATTA BRATTA A sudden increase in fire GERMAN shouts

ROCK
Thats him now

UP THE SLOPE

Nestled among the boulders GORYL is flipping a grenade down on
startled GERMAN SOLDIERS while RETREAD fires the second BAR and BIGELOW
hands him magazines WHIPSNAKE and TEXAS are blazing away with their
rifles ambushing the shit out of the six GERMAN SOLDIERS

BAWHOOOOM GORYLS grenade goes off and GORYL picks up his rifle and
aims at a WOUNDED GERMAN staggering for cover

CRACK THE WOUNDED GERMAN goes down and lies motionless

GORYL
Hold your fire I think we got em

GORYL looks down among the boulders
He can see parts of three different GERMAN UNIFORMSmotionless

GORYL turns to RETREAD
GORYL
Cover me Retread

GORYL has his pistol out and hes crawling cautiously down to where the
GERMAN BODIES lie

FURTHER DOWN THE SLOPE

ROCK is checking WILDMAN whos unconscious now as PASCALANO and
KLUZEWSKI crouch around him among the boulders

PASCALANO
Howd joo know Sarge About the
Lieutenant

ROCK

You remember that time in Kassarene
with that armored car

PASCALANO
Remember I shit my pants

ROCK
Yeah but after you shit your pants
you took out the armored car you
remember that

PASCALANO
And you knew I would

ROCK
Keep those guys pinned down

AMONG THE BOULDERS

GORYL is creeping down to where the ambushed GERMANS were Six feet
ahead of him is a motionless leg The rest of the GERMANS body is
hidden from view behind the boulder And anything else that might be
waiting A wounded German with a pistol perhaps

Terrified GORYL sweats like a pig as he creeps around a boulder
pistol in hand

Then he pauses His hand feels wet

Looking at the hand he sees its soaked with blood
A pool of blood lies on the rock

GORYL scarcely breathing moves around the boulder
A GERMAN lies face down only two feet in front of him
GORYL gulps

Putting the gun to the GERMANS head he pushes the limp body exposing
the face
Lifeless Blonde Dead Young
GORYL crawls over the body and around the next boulder

A GERMAN sits slumped against a rock his chest soaked with blood his
eyes staring lifelessly at nothing

A few feet away another GERMAN is face down in a pool of blood

Pointing the pistol GORYL crawls cautiously toward him and moves his
head

The mans features are gone his face a mass of bloody pulp
GORYL is gagging when he hears RETREADS VOICE calling out

RETREADS VOICE (0S)
Lieutenant You okay

GORYL
(recovering)
Yeah
CUT TO

BOULDERSMOMENTS LATER

Theyre all together among the boulders PASCALANO and BIGELOW
watching the others bunched around ROCK and WILDMAN

WILDMAN looks bad

BEEF
Its bad enough when the krauts get
youbut when your own fucking weapon
gets you

ROCK
Wheres the Lieutenant

BEHIND A BOULDER
GORYL is separated from the others behind a boulder squirming
around half in and half out of his pants when he looks up and

sees RETREAD crawl around the rock GORYL looks embarrassed

GORYL
Uh I uhtaking uh a crap

RETREAD
(knowingly)

GORYL

pack)
Listen it aint the load in your
pants that matters Lieutenant
Its how you carry the load

GORYL

RETREAD
(handing over the pants

You didnt smell too bad there sir

AMONG THE BOULDERS

WILDMAN is moaning semi-conscious as ROCK tends to him while
PASCALANO and KLUZEWSKI look on

PASCALANO
Christ he looks bad Sarge

ROCK
Shock He needs blood he needs a
medic

KLUZEWSKI

More like he needs a miracle
ROCK glares at KLUZEWSKI who drops his eyes hastily
TEN YARDS AWAY

Crouched among the boulders BIGELOW TEXAS WHIPSNAKE and BEEF are
looking down into the valley as RETREAD joins them

Below in the pass tiny figures GERMAN SOLDIERS are hovering beside
a six foot boulder one of many blocking the pass

The GERMAN SOLDIERS suddenly sprint away
BA WHOOOOOM The boulder explodes
RETREAD
Demolition team Theyre gonna clear

the pass

BEEF looks along the barrel of his rifle as he watches the two GERMAN
SOLDIERS hurrying toward another boulder

BEEF
Wish I had the range

RETREAD
POP A rifle shot

sprints for cover

Dont waste a round

in the distance One of the GERMAN SOLDIERS goes
down The other hesitates POP POP The other GERMAN SOLDIER
POP POP He almost makes it before he goes down

For a moment BEEF and the others just stare in stunned silence

Then

TEXAS

BEEF

something something thats hard to say

VAN ROCKLIN stares at the envelope addressed to him from the War

TEN YARDS AWAYMOMENTS LATER

ROCK and GORYL are having an urgent conversation in the darkness

GORYL
If he only saw one man

Between the devil and the deep blue
sea

ROCK

Between the rock and the hard place
There isnt any right answer
Lieutenant

GORYL
But theres probably a wrong one

ROCK
Im not gonna second guess you no

GORYL

ROCK

ROCK starts to move off but GORYL stops him

GORYL

lungs

WHIPSNAKE

BANG BANG Ping Ping WHIPSNAKE breaks off as bullets pierce the
night singing off the rocks around him

AMONG THE BOULDERS

Barely visible in the moonlight ROCK crouches with the others
listening as the shots cease and a sudden eerie silence begins

BEEF
Nothing No acknowledgement

ROCK

listening to
his eyes are

and the others gasp at the word ladies
as good as those guys
Before anyone can move theres a popping sound from below in the pass

Peering over a boulder RETREAD sees a bright flare hanging over the
blocked passand GERMAN SOLDIERS hastily dashing for cover

RETREAD
I dont think the colored guys left

for Berlin yet Sergeant

CRACK CRACK CRACK The GERMAN SOLDIERS are shot down as the flare
fades

AMONG THE BOULDERSLATER

PASCALANO is alert weapon ready behind a boulder while close by TEXAS

TEN YARDS AWAYBOULDERS

Its spooky quiet now as BIGELOW peers into the darkness while TEXAS
sleeps curled up behind him against a boulder

Something touches BIGELOWS hand He considers it Then he feels it
on his face

Snow Its drifting down silently as the moon shines intermittently
through the clouds and we

CUT TO
A MONTAGE
Snow falling on the moonlit duos
PASCALANO watching BEEF sleeping

ROCK watching turns and checks the unconscious WILDMAN wipes snow
from his face

KLUZEWSKI watches while WHIPSNAKE stirs in his sleep
GORYL watches while RETREAD sleeps and we
CUT TO

BOULDERSMUCH LATER

The snow has stopped falling and the spooky silence continues TEXAS
his helmet covered with snow is watching the darkness while BIGELOW
his blanket covered with three hours of snow is sleeping

Studying the darkness intently TEXAS adjusts his hands on his rifle
stiffens Did he hear something Without taking his eyes off the
darkness he kicks BIGELOW awake

TEXAS
(a whisper)
I think theres someone out there

BIGELOW searches desperately for his lifesavers as he looks into the
darkness too

TEN YARDS AWAY

Its KLUZEWSKIS turn to sleep Hes curled up in his blanket also
covered with snow

A grunt in the darkness Violent Urgent

KLUZEWSKI stirs slightly

A moan like somebody had their throat slit and theyre dying quietly
KLUZEWSKI stirs

Unnnnnh Another groan

KLUSEWSKIS eyes open

Silhouetted in the gloom three feet away WHIPSNAKE is struggling
desperately with a shadowy figure A strangled grunt of effort and the
scuffling of clothes on the rock surface are the only sounds in the
spooky moonlit darkness

Pulling his knife KLUZEWSKI lunges and grabs the GERMAN from behind
Hes just about to plunge his knife deep in the enemy soldier when he
freezes mid-motion and stares in stunned disbeliefThe GERMAN
SOLDIERS helmet has fallen offand the GERMAN SOLDIER is ANGIE
dressed in a Nazi uniform thats too big for her Her face is smudged
with dirt her eyes glazed with lust her fatigues open exposing firm
breasts one leg of her pants off as she frantically humps WHIPSNAKE
while speaking to the amazed KLUZEWSKI

ANGIE

KLUZEWSKI

KLUZEWSKI is turning to ANGIE but WHIPSNAKE grabs him

WHIPSNAKE

KLUZEWSKI
WHIP ITS NAZIS FUCKIN NAZIS

WHIPSNAKE turns and sees what KLUZEWSKIS seeing

Four very blonde very Aryan GERMAN SOLDIERS are looming in the
moonlight Their cruel and youthful faces smirk with self assurance
as ANGIE naked now kneels in front of the one named HANS and unzips
his pants HANS unholsters his luger and puts the muzzle close to
ANGIES face his finger on the trigger

KLUZEWSKI
NO

ANGIE leers and takes the barrel in her mouth mouthing it
lasciviously licking sucking licking as BANS gives KLUZEWSKI a
smile and a wink

KLUZEWSKI suddenly realizes another German FRITZ is kneeling behind
her humping like a dog as she responds

KLUZEWSKI
ANGIE YOU GODDAMN SLUT

ANGIE

The GERMAN SOLDIER comes around the boulder so fast he slits BIGELOWS
throat before TEXAS can raise his rifle and fire Even as TEXAS aims
a SECOND GERMAN gets TEXAS from behind and slits hit throat

Three more GERMANS crawl into view as the FIRST GERMAN crouches over
BIGELOW cupping a lit match in one hand while he fishes BIGELOWS dog
tag from the blood at BIGELOWS neck and wipes it off

FIRST GERMAN

Biggle-oww Bigga-low Bigelow

Sudden silence

Clutching their rifles and staring stupidly into the night GORYL and
RETREAD see ROCK loom from behind a boulder cradling the BAR

ROCK

GORYL and RETREAD stand up and see five GERMANS sprawled among the
boulders their blood staining the snow One of them groans

considering the carnage

CATHEDRAL HOSPITALNIGHT

In the confusion of suffering and misery a gaunt looking man with a
heavily bandaged head lies in a cot listening to the DOCTOR standing
over him

DOCTOR
Some confusion even some memory loss

PAINTED WORDSROCK FACEDAWN

Huge letters in white paint are smeared on a rock face overlooking the
pass They spell out loud and clear

FUCK HITLER
WOODS DAWN
A head appears from behind a tree Its WHIPSNAKE staring in wide-eyed
wonder at the words on the rock What the fuck he cant believe it
Shaking his head he looks around furtively then moves cautiously off

through the woods apparently alone

BOULDERS SLOPELATER

ROCK and GORYL are crouched among the boulders facing WHIPSNAKE while
RETREAD keeps watch behind them and WILDMAN lies unconscious

GORYL
Fuck Hitler

WHIPSNAKE
Thats what it said Huge letters
GORYL looks to ROCK who shrugs Behind them RETREAD speaks up

RETREAD
Baker maybe They musta done it
those guys are crazy

GORYL
But no Germans

WHIPSNAKE
No sir Didnt see any an I went
about half a mile into the woods

GORYL looks to ROCK

ROCK
Baker musta taken the heat for us
again Seven guys on us Baker gets
the rest

BOOOOOM Another explosion in the pass RETREAD is watching the
action below

RETREAD
Thats it they got it cleared

The others join RETREAD peering down into the pass where they see the
column of eight tanks begin to wind through the debris of boulders in
the pass squeezing past the disabled tank still partially blocking the
narrowest section

ROCK GORYL and the others watch grimly their faces gaunt and weary
their eyes dull with defeat

RETREAD
Bastards

KLUZEWSKI
Were officially behind enemy lines
now I guess

BOOOOOOM Another explosion
ROCK frowns Theyre all looking at the lead tank suddenly canted at
an angle motionless The column of tanks behind grinds to an abrupt

halt

RETREAD
A mine They musta mined it

Rrrrrrr The lead tank engines grind as the wounded machine tries to
move out of the way then

KA-BLAM The whole tank shudders from a bazooka shell and smoke pours
from torn armor
WHIPSNAKE
(incredulous)
Theyre there Theyre still fucking
there

ROCK is staring in disbelief as he watches the second tank moving
forward turret turning attacking the bazooka position firing KA
BOOOOOM The shell explodes against the boulders

KA-BLAM The second tank takes a bazooka hit in the turret that
crumples armor and slams the gun aside bent at a useless angle

RETREAD
(jubilant)
Siiiiiiilk
KLUZEWSKI
(awed)

Those bastards God damn
ROCK is stunned shaken He cant believe what hes seeing
GORYL
I guess we better move Bakers
giving us another chance

CUT TO

BOULDERSMINUTES LATER

KLUZEWSKI and WHIPSNAKE are carrying WILDMAN up the slope in a poncho
while RETREAD walks point and ROCK brings up the rear ROCK glances
back down at the pass

Far below he can see the tanks stalled in a line while tiny GERMAN
FOOTSOLDIERS slink among the boulders trying to get position

Chatta chatta chatta The sound of machinegun fire drifts upward from
the firefight

ROCK is turning back to the climb when something catches his eye to the
north

Five birds are clearing the mountains to the north tiny silhouettes
in the dawn sky

For a moment ROCK stares as dawn sunlight suddenly gleams off a
birds wing Then he gives a sharp command

ROCK
Planes Lets go for the woods sir

PILOTS POINT OF VIEWCOCKPIT

Its a beautiful dawn seen from the Stuka cockpit as sun glitters off
the snowy slopes and the PILOT watches the valley unfold before him
while his radio crackles with urgent German voices Ahead and below
he can see the narrow pass and the column of stalled tanks and a rock
face featuring FUCK HITLER in big white letters

Responding to radio commands the PILOT veers to the right and the sky
pans by in a blur of blue as he separates from his companions and aims

his nose at the rocky slope on the west wall of the pass

Far below he can see tiny GERMAN SOLDIERS waving and pointing up the
slope

Near the top of the slope he can just glimpse tiny figures the EASY
SOLDIERS scrambling up the slope and into the woods at the top

Now hes diving at the woods his dive-activated sirens coming rapidly
up to full scream as the woods loom larger in the windscreen and tiny
figures disappear among the trees

Now his wing-mounted machineguns begin to chatter mercilessly

IN THE WOODS

ROCK is helping haul WILDMAN behind a tree as the Stuka bears down on
them The thunder of the engines is deafening bullets chew up trees

KLUZEWSKI hugs the earth
WHIPSNAKE presses against a tree
Just as the sound reaches unbearable volume it suddenly drops off as
the Stuka pulls abruptly out of its dive and climbs up again into the
sky
ROCK peers out and spots the underwing load
ROCK
Stay down Hes got bombs hes

coming back

Fear It shows in their faces as they crouch or lie in their
positions waiting

The Stuka comes screaming down out of the sky again cannons flashing
machineguns nattering Wood chips fly as bullets tear into trees and
the screaming engines get louder and louder and louder and

BOOOOOOOM BAH-DOOOOOODOM The woods shake with the thunder of the
bombs heat and fire fill the air

Theres a moment of quiet then followed by KLUZEWSKIS shout of
enthusiasm

KLUZEWSKI
Missed us Dumb bastard missed us

Fuck you kraut

Shaking like a leaf GORYL watches the plane climbing back into the
sky
ROCK is looking off into the pass beyond the fringe of woods

The other four Stukas are wheeling in the sky like angry hornets
taking turns diving at Bakers position

KLUZEWSKIS watching too Suddenly he sees a figure dart out from
among the boulders in the pass and scamper toward a new position

KLUZEWSKI
No No No Dont show yourself
idiot No

ROCK RETREAD and the others are all watching now seeing a diving
STUKA adjust its dive heading right for the boulders where the figure
disappeared machineguns firing

KLUZEWSKI
He gave away their position he

WHUMP At the bottom of its dive the STUKA suddenly shudders in the
air smoke pours from the fuselage The plane struggles out of its
dive wobbles along at low altitude billowing smoke then plunges into
the rocky wall of the pass and explodes

WHIPSNAKE
No No they couldnt

RETREAD
(jumping up)
AWRIGHT SILK YEAH LIGHTNING YEAH
BAKER STUKA BAZOOKA

ROCK spins spots movement and opens up with the BAR

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA ROCK squeezes off a burst from the

WHIPSNAKE
Just lemme see where

RETREAD suddenly stiffens his eyes bulge sightlessly
and choking on his tongue

WHIPSNAKE tries to hold the thrashing RETREAD down and
from his throat

GORYL pauses to watch RETREAD thrashing and convulsing
second before he moves into position close to ROCK and
at the invisible GERMANS

BAR

hes convulsing

clear his tongue

for half a
points his rifle

RETREAD stiffens mid convulsion then sags limply in the snow his eyes

open and blind

WHIPSNAKE
No goddamnit hang on

WHIPSNAKE is trying to get RETREAD to breathe but RETREAD is gone

Sprawled beside ROCK behind a tree trunk GORYL is looking for a good

shot as he confers with ROCK

GORYL
How many

ROCK
At least six Probably more

GORYL
Were pretty low on ammo

WHIPSNAKE wriggles close to them as a couple of shots whistle close by

WHIPSNAKE
Retread is dead

ROCK
How about if I cover the rear sir
while you and the men fall back

GORYL looks at ROCK but ROCK doesnt meet the look hes looking down
the sights looking for GERMANS GORYL hesitates for a moment then

he makes up his mind
GORYL
Okay give us ten minutes then
follow

ROCK reaches in his pack and pulls out a cigar placing it unlit
between his teeth

ROCK
Right sir

ROCK mouthes the cigar and peers into the woods looking for a target
but the enemy is virtually invisible

TEN YARDS AWAY

GORYL accepts a handful of clips collected by BEEF Hes turning to
take them to ROCK when he sees WILDMAN

WILDMANS eyes are unfocussed his mouth open his jaw slack his skin
grey and waxy GORYL feels WILDMANS wrist searching for a pulse

ROCKBEHIND A TREE

ROCK fires a short burst as a GERMAN scrambles from one tree to
another advancing The GERMAN yells a pained oath wounded

GORYL creeps close to ROCK and puts the clips beside him

GORYL
We gotcha another thirty rounds

ROCK

GORYL
(with difficulty)
Sergeantwere not taking Wildman

ROCK gives GORYL a sharp look

GORYL

WOODS

GORYL is leading his weary ragtag group through the woods that rise
above the steep walls of the pass The men look exhausted defeated
as they plod hurriedly through the snow hearing far behind them the
brief bursts of gunfire indicating the continuing battle between the
Germans and Rock In the sky to their left the four remaining STUKAS
snarl as they regroup and turn back to the north

KLUZEWSKI
Outta ammo There they go

WHIPSNAKE is listening to the patter of the BAR far behind them

WHIPSNAKE
Rock shoulda backed off by now

BEEF
More planes Poor Baker

They all look and see six dread Messerschmitt ME 109s replacing the
STUKAS in the sky over the pass

GORYL looks grimly over his shoulder at them as he walks The men keep
plodding as the thunder of the planes grows louder It seems as if
there is nothing for them but defeat defeat and more defeat as they
continue their ignominious retreat

Then a ME 109 rages over the woods as if to pass over them

GORYL
Okay men lets take cover lets

Looking up GORYL breaks off mid-sentence at the sight of a blur of
silver above and the sudden bluster of angry cannons and machineguns

In half a second the ME 109 is streaming smoke plummeting into the
slope and exploding like a bomb

The swooping blur of silver banks hard and climbs back up a Republic
P-47 Thunderbolt looking for prey Donald Duck in paint glaring from
the silver fuselage

The stunned men of Easy stare at the sky where four more THUNDERBOLTS
are taking on the ME 109s in a fury of speed and gunfire

KLUZEWSKI falls to his knees as if in church as another ME 109 tumbles
out of the sky smoking

Tears flow unabashedly down WHIPSNAKES dirty unshaven cheeks as he
sings to himself privately in a low voice out of tune

WHIPSNAKE
(to himself a song)
Oh beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain

Another ME 109 explodes in mid-air as a THUNDERBOLT rakes it
mercilessly with machinegun fire They rule the sky the
THUNDERBOLTS taking no prisoners dealing out swift sure death to the
outclassed ME 109s

BEEF is hugging GORYL KLUZEWSKI is cheering

WHIPSNAKE
(continuing very low)
For purple mountains majesty
above the fruited plain

WOODSA MILE AWAY
CRACK CRACK CRACK Rifle fire

ROCK is in trouble running low through trees heading for cover behind
a modest formation of boulders in the middle of the woods

Spang spang spang Bullets splinter off the boulders as he dives for
cover Hastily he raises the BAR and runs off a burst at his pursuers
BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA

Several GERMAN SOLDIERS dive for cover on the ground

The magazine is empty no more ammo ROCK pushes the BAR aside and
unslings an M-1

CRACK SPANG CRACK SPANG Bullets ricochet close to his head
somebody firing from the side Theyve almost got ROCK surrounded

CRACK CRACK ROCK returns the fire at just a glimpse of uniform fifty
yards away

CRACK A shot from the other side Theyre flanking him almost but
not quite surrounding him

This is bad They already know where he is so he relights the stub of
cigar clenched between his teeth and scans the woods carefully for a
target He hears a GERMAN VOICE

GERMAN VOICEWOODS
(German subtitled)
Hans I think its only one man
Alone

Suddenly a GERMAN SOLDIER rears up only twenty yards away arm cocked
grenade in hand

CRACK ROCK pans and fires without hesitation
The GERMAN SOLDIER goes down before he can throw the grenade

GERMAN VOICEWOODS
(German subtitled)
Peter Throw it
Too late The grenade goes off un-thrown BOOOOM

CRACK CRACK CRACK Two GERMANS pop up and sprint low between trees
and ROCK squeezes off three shots

A silence engulfs the woods then ROCK sweating loads his last clip
To his right movement a blur of uniforms among the trees
CRACK CRACK CRACK He fires sending one man sprawling

BANG BANG BANG A GERMAN SOLDIER jumps up firing only twenty yards
away bullets whiz at ROCK ROCK swings the rifle CRACK CRACK The
GERMAN SOLDIER staggers forward dead ten yards on the other side of
the boulder

ROCK glances at his shoulder where a bullet has torn his uniform and
his flesh Hes going to bandage it but sudden movement again on the
right

CRACK CRACK ROCK fires twice and a blur of uniforms disappears
among the trees ROCKS clip is empty no more ammo He hastily
inspects his wound and relights his cigar

The woods are suddenly very quiet A VOICE snarls from somewhere
straight ahead disturbingly close but unseen speaking in heavily
accented English

GERMAN VOICEWOODS
(in accented English)
You Asshole You hear me nigger
Jew Dead Cut your balls off

ROCK is relighting his cigar his eyes busy surveying the woods as he
responds in a cheery burst of German

ROCK
(German subtitled)
Hans Your mothers here Your
darling mother Great tits What a
woman

ANGLE ON TWO GERMANS

Outside of ROCKS line of vision two GERMAN SOLDIERS are flanking
ROCK almost behind him They cant see him but they can hear his
voiceand they can see a curl of smoke from his cigar coiling above
the boulder hes crouched behind

ROCKS VOICE (0S)
(continuing)
Shit Hans Your mothers taking off
her pants What an ass You must
love her a lot

The two GERMAN SOLDIERS continue their stealthy approach as a GERMAN
VOICE responds to ROCK this time in German

GERMAN VOICE (0OS)
(German subtitled)
Hey American you got a good accent
Why dont you surrender Huh Well
treat you good Very nice Asshole

The two GERMAN SOLDIERS dont give ROCK a chance to reply Theyre
only six feet from the boulder where hes hidden they can smell the
smoke curling from his cigar they charge forward firing point
blank

RATTA TATTA TATTA CRACK CRACK RATTA TATTA

The GERMAN SOLDIERS stop firing abruptly when they see what theyre
shooting at

ROCKS pack is there on the ground theyve shot the shit out of it
but ROCKS not there Though his cigar butt is smoldering in a
crease in the boulder

And just thenPLOP A grenade lands right at their feet

Both GERMAN SOLDIERS stare at it in horror for a quarter secondthen
they dive aside flat on their bellies covering their faces

BEHIND A TREEFIVE YARDS AWAY

ROCK is pressed against a tree waiting for the grenade to go off
but nothing happens

Puzzled ROCK peers out from behind the tree

He sees the grenade lying thereand FREIDRICH and HORST lying on
their faces

ROCKS rueful look says its a dud Now what
A VOICE calls in German from the woods
GERMAN VOICE (0S)
(German subtitled)

Horst Freidrich Did you get the
fucker

ANGLE ON FREIDRICH AND HORST

FREIDRICH looks up peeks at the grenade
It just lies there
FREIDRICH

(in German)
A dud
Hes scrambling to his feet grabbing his rifle

So is HORSTwhen suddenly ROCK lunges from behind the tree knife in
hand

ROCK
BOOOOOOOOM

Sinking his knife deep into the astonished FREIDRICHS rib cage he
shoves him back into HORST whos trying to raise his rifle

FREIDRICH goes down coughing blood done for and HORST stumbles
backward tries to raise his rifle only to find himself wrestling with
the powerful ROCK

But HORST is no slouch A big muscular man himself he manages to
club ROCK in the face with a rifle butt

WOODSOTHER SIDE OF BOULDER

A GERMAN SERGEANT is cautiously leading the remaining two GERMAN
SOLDIERS toward the boulder He calls out

GERMAN SERGEANT
Horst

HORSTS VOICE (0OS)
(German subtitled)
Help

The GERMAN SERGEANT and the two SOLDIERS respond to the strangled cry
rushing toward the boulder guns ready

BEHIND THE BOULDER

Coming around the boulder weapons raised the GERMAN SERGEANT and the
two SOLDIERS find FREIDRICH sitting down bleeding to death

Fifteen yards away HORST and ROCK are staggering among the trees
grappling furiously slamming against trunks engaged in an awkward
life or death struggle

What the GERMAN SERGEANT and the two SOLDIERS dont see is the dud
grenade lying on the ground almost at their feet

BA-WHOOOOOOOOOOM Just as the GERMAN SERGEANTS steps place him
within a foot of the grenade all three of them are ravaged with
shrapnel

WOODSTHIRTY YARDS AWAY

Bloody and torn ROCK and HORST are struggling to the death and its
not pretty its not Hollywood punches its biting kicking kneeing
butting and biting some more rolling in the snow battling to their
feet careening into tree trunks

ROCK drives HORST back into a tree HORST knees ROCK in the groin
they roll on the ground locked in an embrace while HORST sinks his
teeth deeply into ROCKS cheek and blood flows Rolling they come
to a stone protruding from the ground and its there that ROCK
with a supreme effort manages to smash HORSTS head against the
stone until HORST suddenly goes limp and his eyes roll back in his
head

For a second all ROCK can do is suck air into his lungs Then he
collapses rolling off HORSTS body into the snow until his cheek
rests againstA COMBAT BOOT

For a second ROCK just stares at the leather of the boot close-up
Then he slowly looks up the boot to the leg and follows the leg upward
with his eyes

Looming over him is a tough looking battle-scarred American SERGEANT
six-four muscularand black as coal The big man reaches a huge
black hand down to ROCK

STEELE
Steele Baker Company

ROCK takes the hand and lets the big man hoist him to his feet

ROCK
Rock Easy

STEELE
(impressed)
You all alone Rock

ROCK
Rear guard Theres krauts all over

ROCK is looking around with alarm but STEELE interrupts him producing
bandages

STEELE
Not no more Rock Theres dead bodies
all over the damn woods You left a
helluva trail Hitler gonna be mad
with you I swear You really raised
some hell

STEELE keeps talking as he bandages the numerous tears in ROCKS flesh
his huge black hands very gentle in contradiction to his brutal
appearance

STEELE

(continuing)
When I come up on you it was just
you and him

(indicates Horsts body)

and I says to myself Big

Willie if you interfere now you
an that white Sergeant gonna have
yourselves a prisoner An then

I ax myself Do you an that white
Sergeant really want a prisoner
An I seen you handle yourself with
a certain determination not

Sergeant gonna prevail over that
kraut bastard so I didnt

ROCK
We saw you and your men down in the
pass

STEELE

(bandaging pleased)
Yeah we did some good soldier-work

Bandaged now ROCK considers the proud STEELES coal black face

ROCK
Thats not an Italian suntan then

STEELE
Ha ha where you from Rock

ROCK is heading back toward the boulders and his pack

ROCK
Akron Ohio Where are your men

STEELE
(walking with him)

Akron mmmmm Thought I recognized

STEELE glances up where P-47s snarl overhead ruling the sky

ROCKS PACKMOMENTS LATER

ROCK considers his pack lying on the ground near the GERMAN CORPSES

Its shot full of holes from FREIDRICH and HORSTS attack He lifts
it gingerly and opens it while STEELE goes over the corpses

STEELE
I love these German binoculars
Zeiss I juss keep upgrading my
collection
ROCK is reaching in the pack and finding his bullet riddled box of
cigars

STEELE
Kinda like the lugers too
(pocketing one)
They say if you surrender an the
krauts find a luger on you they
torture you and kill you

Opening the box ROCK finds a dismal collection of mutilated cigars and
loose tobacco

ROCK
Not planning on surrendering huh

STEELE
(suddenly serious)
The black man dont surrender
Sergeant The krauts figure all men
of color got lugers Theycut
upsumma my men a couple days ago

For a moment their eyes meet and nothing is said Then ROCK speaks
soberly

ROCK
I got a man back there half a mile
I gotta get his tags

STEELE
Ill walk witcha

WOODSSECONDS LATER

Walking back through the woods STEELE keeps a wary eye on the woods
while ROCK continues to fish in the cigar box He finally finds a
cigar and shoves it in his mouth lights it

ROCK
Wanna cigar

STEELE
Yeah You got an extra

ROCK reaches in the box and fishes out one more intact cigar hands it
to STEELE who hesitates

STEELE
I wouldnt take a mans last smoke

ROCK
Plenty more

ROCK closes the box on nothing but loose tobacco no more cigars
As STEELE lights his cigar
the bloody snow and slumped against trees
for landmarks

ROCK
Over there

ROCK points as we

WILDMANSECONDS LATER

Propped against a tree WILDMAN
face
WILDMAN
Hiya Sarge Gonna save
ROCK is staring at WILDMAN He didnt expect this

STEELE

STEELE

they walk past GERMAN SOLDIERS sprawled in

ROCK is scanning the woods

CUT TO

grins weakly from a ghostly pale

my ass again

Neither did

Thought you said he was

ROCK
Guess I was premature

WILDMAN
Dead You thought I was

ROCK sees something in the snow close to WILDMAN
picks up one of the two empty bottles and considers it

WILDMAN
(continuing weakly)

Reaching down he

disappears
ROCK is staring at a double set of footprints in the snow coming and
going He follows the footprints with his eyes sees them disappear
into the ominous woodsin the direction of battle Whatever the
redheads doing he isnt retreating

ROCK
(turning back to Wildman)
Well I guess you thought about your
girlfriend huh

WILDMAN
Im savin myself for her I guess
Im gonna ride that bus again the one
with no springs

ROCK glances at STEELE who shrugs glumly as we

CUT TO

RIDGEOUTSIDE FARMHOUSE

Theres an air of confusion as truckloads of fresh troops arrive and
unload creating a chaotic atmosphere Big guns are being pulled into
position SARGEANTS are assembling the replacements Frightened eyes
young faces clean uniforms

Frowning PRITCHARD hurries through the turmoil and enters the
farmhouse

INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

Lounging on the floor and slumped up against the walls of the
farmhouse the weary men of Easy look up as as PRITCHARD enters

PRITCHARD
At ease men Uh theres some bad
news and I wanted

GORYL
(alarmed)
Rock The Sergeant

PRITCHARD
No no we havent located Sergeant
Rock nothing like that Its just
a littleproblem I know I promised
you men the next truck outyou
certainly deserve itbut there was
a little snafu and somebody let a
bunch of colored fellows from Baker
Negroes into the truck

Impassive faces of Easy stare uncomprehendingly at PRITCHARD who goes
rattling on

PRITCHARD
I could kick them outbut I kind of
hate to do that they fought like hell
and theyre as beat up as you I
mean theres room in the truck but
you guysd probably rather wait for
the next one

The men of Easy look at each other as though PRITCHARD had just
finished a speech in Greek or classical Latin as we

CUT TO

INSIDE A FOUR BY FOURMOMENTS LATER

Eight bone weary BLACK SOLDIERS are sprawled in the rear of the 4x4
troop carrier as the men from Easy start to climb in

TIGER COLE a tough looking Corporal from Baker is quick to spot GORYL
and he snaps at LIGHTNING MULLINS lounging on the right hand bench

TIGER
Lightning Officer on board move
your ass

GORYL

At ease men

GORYL scrambles in The black men are all moving to the left bench
bunching up facing the men from Easy who are taking places on the
opposite bench facing them Theres an awkwardness everybodys
exhausted weary nods are exchanged The black soldiers are as
bandaged as gaunt as unshaven as young and as tired as the men from
Easy their uniforms filthy and torn

LIGHTNING
Say Lieutenant you didnt see no
great big staff sergeant walkin round
out there didja

GORYL and all the men from Easy look up sharply at LIGHTNING

LIGHTNING
Colored man Sorta lame

GORYL
No Im afraid not

TIGER speaks softly to LIGHTNING reassuring him as the truck lurches
forward

TIGER
He be along Aint no nazzies gonna
hurt Big Willie he indestructible

The truck is bouncing along now and the two rows of soldiers face each
other uncomfortably a certain tension in the air between them BEEF
suddenly breaks the silence with a voice full of outrage
BEEF
Hey Lieutenant

The atmosphere is electric as GORYL turns to BEEF and everybody follows
the look to see what put the edge in BEEFS voice They see BEEF
glaring indignantly at the brown skinned Negro directly across from him
who wears a bandage over his left eye (so does Beef) and a sling on his
right arm (so does Beef)

GORYL
(uneasy)
Whats up Beef

BEEF
(pointing)
This guys got my wound
Everybody looks TIGER breaks the amazed silence
TIGER
Aaaaw shit Silk You got the mans

wound

SILK considers his wounded arm soberly

SILK
Thought it was mine it hurts like
hell

BEEF

Thats it Thats the one hurts
like hell that proves its mine

SILK
Well shit I aint gonna argue with
you I aint that partial to it
anyhow you could have it

Now BEEF shakes his head suddenly shifting gears

BEEF
Well what the hell were all
fightin the same war we got a common
enemy I aint gonna be an asshole
about it even if it is mine Im
gonna share it with you

SILK
(ruefully)
Well I sure do appreciate the
generosity

Grins and low chuckles The ice is broken the atmosphere is relaxed
now as the truck bounces along the road

Another black soldier COLLINS speaks up now
COLLINS
Say anybody here know if we winning
or losing this war

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

American guns are thundering from the ridge hurling shells into the
woods to the north as GENERAL DUGAN COLONEL CRONKITE AND MAJOR
PRITCHARD face a semicircle of WAR CORRESPONDENTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS
from Life and Look all wearing fatigues and helmets

DUGAN

You will hear a lot from the Germans
about will and (pardon my French)
all that kind of shit Well lemme
tell you fellas something about
will The Germans counterattacked
down there they overwhelmed our boys
outnumbered em outgunned em cost
them seventy eighty per cent
casualties
They opened the pass and started
marching through with an armored
column a couple of rifle companies
air support heavy artillery barrages
and there wasnt anything we could do
about it All our fire power at that
time was committed east of here we
were spread too thin to hold the pass
But Major Pritchard here and his very
brave men decided they were gonna hold
anyway and they were gonna test their
will against some Nazzey steel

(a beat)
And you dont see any nazzies on this
side of the pass do you

Flashbulbs pop as PRITCHARD beams modestly and we
CUT TO

WOODED SLOPETHE PASS

As they make their weary way along the slope carrying WILDMAN between
them in a poncho STEELE and ROCK soberly consider the pass far below
where scorched and blackened Panzers immobile and still smoking
attest to the fury of American air power

STEELE shakes his head at the sight

STEELE
Daaaaamn We fight an fight day an
night couple weeks right on the
linean we doan do half the damage
them flyboys do in five minutes

ROCK
Yeah thats how it is in love and
war

STEELE
Aint it true But I will say when
I come over here to sunny Italy an
I seen those nazzies I about shit in
my pants I says to myself Big

STEELE

STEELE
A piano teacher Well thats what

real soldiers I figured they was
gonna fight real goodand I wasnt
wrong was I

ROCK
Nope

STEELE
What I didnt know then was how good
a buncha farm boys an ironworkers an
such could fight

ROCK isnt listening Hes seen something on the next ridge where
smoke is blowing from a big gun

Silhouetted in the smoke is a LONE FIGURE heading north into enemy
territory his torso draped with plasma bottles a red cross on his
arm His helmet is cocked back on his head and backlight shines
through the shock of red hair spilling onto his forehead

Almost immediately hes lost in the smoke

ROCK keeps moving forward without taking his eyes off the spot where
OHARA disappeared as STEELE continues

STEELE
I mean if I was a nazzey an I hadda
go up against my men or your men Id
be scared you know

ROCK
Yeah

ROCKS attention is on the ridge
The smoke clearsbut OHARA is gone

BOOOOOM The big gun thunders again belching smoke hurling furious
steel north at the German positions

STEELE
You think we gonna win it Rock
