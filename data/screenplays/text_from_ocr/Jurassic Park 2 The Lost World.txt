THE LOST WORLD
JURASSIC PARK

screenplay by
David Koepp

based on the novel by
Michael Crichton

EXT TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore ina
tropical lagoon The beach is a stunning crescent of white
sand at the jungle fringe utterly deserted

ISLA SORNA
87 miles southeast of Nublar

Two SHIP HANDS dressed in white uniforms have set up a
picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
laying out luncheon service -- fine china silver crystal
decanters with red and white wine

PAUL BOWMAN fortyish sits in a chair off to the side
reading MRS BOWMAN painfully thin with the perpetually
surprised look of a woman whos had her eyes done more than
once supervises the settings of the table

She looks up and sees a little girl CATHY seven or eight
years old wandering off down the beach

MRS BOWMAN
Cathy Dont wander off

Cathy keeps wandering
MRS BOWMAN (contd)
Cathy come back You can look for
shells right here
Cathy gestures pretending she cant hear
BOWMAN
(eyes still in his book)

Leave her alone

MRS BOWMAN
What about snakes

BOWMAN
Theres no snakes on a beach Let

her have fun for once

FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH
Cathy keeps wandering away MUTTERING to herself as her
parents quarreling voices fade in the distance

CATHY
Please be quiet please be quiet
please be quiet

Rounding a curve in the beach her parents disappear from view
behind her A RUSTLING sound draws her attention and she
turns toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
sand

A large bush maybe twelve feet tall is moving its branches
swaying and shaking Curious Cathy walks up to the bush
which abruptly stops moving

A small lizard-like animal dark green with brown stripes
along its back steps out from the bush Only about a foot
tall it stands on its hind legs balancing on its thick tail
It walks upright bobbing its head like a chicken

CATHY
Well hello there

The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her Cathy squats
down on her haunches

CATHY (contd)
What are you A little bird or
something

She opens her hand Shes got a handful of goldfish crackers

CATHY (contd)
Are you hungry You want a goldfish

The compy bobs forward a few steps cautiously

CATHY (contd)
Come on I wont hurt you

The compy draws closer Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
of her hand The compy gets closer still --

-- and hops numbly up onto Cathys palm Her arm dips a bit
under the weight but its not that heavy and she holds it up
easily It bobs its head scarfs up the goldfish and eats
it

Enchanted Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
hand calling back over her shoulder

CATHY (contd)
Mom Dad You gotta come see this
I found something

She turns back
Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand Theyre
standing there bobbing anxiously staring at her from a few
feet away Cathys smile fades

She turns her head slowly to the right TWENTY MORE COMPYS
have come in from that side forming a semi-circle bobbing
and CHIPPING as they surround her

CATHY (contd)
(terrified)
What do you guys want

BACK ON THE BEACH
the table is set Mrs Bowman calls out

MRS BOWMAN
Cathy sweetheart Lunch is ready

From around the curve of the beach a flock of birds bolts
from the jungle trees as Cathys shrill SCREAMS suddenly
pierce the air

MRS BOWMAN
PAUL

She takes off running down the beach Mr Bowman leaps out of
his chair and follows and all available deck hands race off
to help kicking up geysers of sand behind them

DOWN THE BEACH

Mrs Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
in the beach We dont see what she sees but we hear the
frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys Mr Bowman and the
Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs Bowman lets loose a
horrified slack-jawed SCREAM her mouth a perfect oval

DISSOLVE TO
INT BOARD ROOM - DAY

Mrs Bowmans screaming face dissolves slowly over the

YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE TWENTY OTHER
EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
monied corporation All are in expensive suits most are over
sixty There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too whispering in their
lawyers who sit behind their clients whispering in their

ears Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
hint that everyones been here a long time

A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
down the long table pat the grim faces of the board members

VOICE (0OS)
The hurricane seemed like a disaster
at the time but now I think it was a
blessing natures way of freeing
those animals from their human
confines Of giving them another
chance to survive but this time as
they were meant to without mans
interference

The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND the founder of InGen
and creator of Jurassic Park But hes not in the room His
image is on a closed circuit TV screen which has been wheeled
up to the end of the table

And he doesnt look good Hes terribly infirmed propped up
in bed his face pale and drawn medical equipment BEEPING
around him

HAMMOND (contd)
There are some corporate issues that
are not about the bottom line We
have so much still to learn about
those creatures A whole world of
intricate interlocking behaviors
vanished everywhere -- except for
Site B Please Lets not do what
is good for more men at the expense
at what is best for all mankind

The CHAIRMAN seventyish nods awkwardly to the television

CHAIRMAN
Thank you John Mr Ludlow

He turns to PETER LUDLOW late thirties a man with the
anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk
Ludlow flips open a file pulls out a stack of black and white
eight by tens and tosses them on the table

LUDLOW

(an accent similar to

Hammonds)
These pictures were taken ina
hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
hours ago after an American family
on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
B The little girl will be fine but
her parents are wealthy angry and
very fond of lawsuits But thats
hardly new to us is it

(takes a paper from the

file)
Wrongful death settlements partial
list family of Donald Gennaro 365
million dollars family of Robert
Muldoon 126 million Damaged or
destroyed equipment 173 million
Demolition de-construction and
disposal of Isla Nublar facilities
organic and inorganic one hundred
and twenty-six million dollars The

list goes on gentlemen -- research
funding media payoffs Silence is
expensive

Hes warming up Not a bad performer

LUDLOW (contd)
This corporation has been bleeding
from the throat for four years You
our board of directors have set
patiently and listened to ecology
lectures while Mr Hammond signed
your checks and spent your money
You have watched your stock drop from
seventy-eight and a quarter to
nineteen flat with no good and in
sight And all along we have held a
significant product asset that we
could have safely harvested and
displayed for profit Enormous
profit

He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove
sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
them Its a mini-mall version of a zoo Cages hold tiny
replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
and Tourists look on in wonder

LUDLOW (contd)
Enough money to wipe out four years
of lawsuits and damage control and
unpleasant infighting enough to not
only send our stock back to where it
was but to double it And the one
thing the only thing standing
between us and this asset is a
born-again naturalist who happens to
be our own CEO Well I dont work
for Mother Nature I work for you

Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack
Ludlow takes one and reads from it

LUDLOW (contd)
Whereas the Chief Executive
Officer has engaged in wasteful and
negligent business practices to
further his own personal
environmental beliefs --
Whereas these practices have
affected the financial performance
of the company by incurring
significant losses --
Whereas the shareholders have been
materially harmed by these losses --
Thereby be it resolved that John
Parker Hammond should be resolved from
the office of Chief Executive

Officer affective immediately Mr
Chairman I move the resolution be

put to an immediate vote Do I have

a second

BOARD MEMBER
I second the motion Mr Chairman
Please poll the members by a show of
hands

The CHAIRMAN signs heavily feeling like a traitor He cant
bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor

CHAIRMAN
All those in favor of InGen Corporate
Resolution 213C please signify your
approval by raising your right hand

It starts slowly guiltily but every hand in the room goes
up Ludlow sits back victorious Hammond furious raises
his right hand which holds a remote control and points it at
the TV screen It goes blank

CUT TO
EXT WELDERS YARD - NIGHT

Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
of a welders yard Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere
Somewhere inside the shed a phone RINGS

The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off DIETER STARK a big
barrel-chested man of forty or so his face streaked with soot
and grime steps outside with a cordless phone a cigarette
dangling from his lips

DIETER
Yeah

He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end He
smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke

CUT TO
INT NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
underneath Manhattan The door WHOOSH open spit out some
COMMUTERS and suck up a few more

A tall man hurries down the platform limping heavily moving
as fast as he can The subway doors begin to close but just
before they meet --
-- the man jams a cane in between stopping them The man

is IAN MALCOLM fortyish dressed in black from head to toe
Theres a hard wisdom in Malcolms eyes that may not have been
theres a few years ago -- he know what you think and he
doesnt care

INT SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down
He looks awful Tired Weathered He notices a CURIOUS MAN
across from his is staring at his Malcolm looks away The

Curious Man still stares Nervy the Curious Man gets up and
approaches

MALCOLM
(under his breath)
Shit

The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm grinning

MAN
Youre him arent you

MALCOLM
Excuse me
MAN
The guy The scientist I saw you
on TV
(conspiratorially)

I believed you
No response from Malcolm The guy leans in even closer

MAN (contd)
Roooooarr

MALCOLM
(a withering look)
I was misquoted I was merely
speculating on the evolutionary
scenario of a Lost World I never
said I was in any such place

He gets up and moves to another seat on the car away from the
Curious Man As he sits down he notices two other COMMUTERS
across from him are staring at him

He looks at them They looks away

He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him Nowhere
to hide

INT JOHN HAMMONDS APARTMENT - NIGHT

A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question
BUTLER
Whom shall I tell Mr Hammond is
calling

MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
Avenue apartment

MALCOLM
Ian Malcolm

A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back
It bounds straight at Malcolm GROWLING jaws SNAPPING It
lunges --

-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane
The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away WHINING The
Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly

BUTLER
Not an animal lover

MALCOLM
Not really

INT HAMMONDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
bed we saw earlier on the other side of the room

Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
the furniture and flowers but the sheer abundance of it tells
us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle

HAMMOND
Ian Dont linger in the doorway
like an ingenue come in come in

Malcolm steps further into the room

HAMMOND (contd)
Its good to see you It really is
Hows the leg

MALCOLM
Resentful

HAMMOND

When you have a lot of time to think
its funny who you remember Its
the people who challenged you It is
the quality of our opponents that
gives our accomplishments meaning I
never told you how sorry I was about
what happened after we returned

Noticing Hammonds deteriorated condition Malcolm finds it
hard to sustain anger
Malcolm

MALCOLM
I didnt know you -- werent well

HAMMOND
Its the lawyers The lawyers are
finally killing me

MALCOLM
They do have motives Why did you
want to see me Your message said it
was urgent

HAMMOND
You were right -- and I was wrong
There Did you ever think youd hear
me say that Spectacularly wrong
Instead of observing those animals I
tried to control them I squandered
an opportunity and we still know next
to nothing about their lives Not
their lives as man would have them
behind electric fences but in the
wild Behavior in their natural
habitat the impossible dream of any
paleontologist I could have had it
but I let it slip away

(pause)

Thank God for Site B

just looks at him for a long moment

MALCOLM
What

HAMMOND
(a spark in his eye)
Well Didnt it all seem a trifle
compact to you

MALCOLM
What are you talking about

HAMMOND
The hatchery in particular You
know my initial yields had to be low
far less than one percent thats a
thousand embryos for every single
live birth Genetic engineering on
that scale implies a giant operation
not the spotless little laboratory I
showed you

MALCOLM
I dont believe you

HAMMOND
Isla Nublar was just a showroom Ian
something for the tourists Site B
was the factory floor We built it
first on Isla Sorna eight-some
miles from Nublar

MALCOLM
No no no no no no

HAMMOND
After the accident at the park a
hurricane wiped out our facility on
Site B We had to evacuate and leave
the animals to fend for themselves
And they did For four years Ive
fought to keep them safe from human
meddling now I want you to go there
and document them

MALCOLM
Are you out of your mind I still
have nightmares my reputations a
joke my leg is shot -- you think I
need more of that

HAMMOND
It would be the most extraordinary
living fossil record the world has
ever seen

MALCOLM
So what

Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
to him and open it on his lap Inside there are memos
charts maps and photographs

HAMMOND

Ive been putting this together for
over a year

(MORE)
I have personal suggestions for your
entire team phone numbers contact
people They wont believe you about
what theyre going to see so dont
bother trying to convince them Just
use my checkbook to get them there
Ill fund your expedition through my
personal accounts as such money and
equipment as you need but only if
you leave immediately If we
hesitate all will be lost

MALCOLM
John

HAMMOND
Youll need an animal behaviorist
someone with unimpeachable
credentials I believe you already
know Sarah Harding Shes got
theories about parenting and
nurturing among hunterscavengers I
bet shed be dying to prove ona
scale like this If you convince her
to go itll be a major coup When
she publishes the scientific
community must take it seriously

Malcolm just shakes his head flipping through the file sadly

HAMMOND
Your documentation you should use
forensic photographic methods
Hasselbladt still cameras high
definition video When the trick
photography analysts take your
evidence apart make it impossible
for them to say there was enhancement
or computer graphic imaging Oh
this is very important -- avoid the
island interior at all costs Stick
to the outer rim Everything you
need to know can be found there
Vindication lies on the outer rim

Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond

MALCOLM
Im not going John

HAMMOND

(fatigue returning)
Ian you are my last chance to give
something of real value to the world
I cant walk so far and leave no
footprints die and leave nothing
with my name on it I will not be
known only for my failures And you
will not allow yourself to go down in
history as a lunatic Youre too
smart Youe too proud Dr
Malcolm Please This is a chance
at redemption For both of us
Theres no time to equivocate we
must seize it now before --

He stops staring over Malcoms shoulder Malcom turns
PETER LUDLOW still in his overcoat is standing in the
doorway to the bedroom He looks back and forth from Hammond
to Malcolm suspiciously

LUDLOW
Hello Uncle John Dr Malcolm
Malcolm doesnt answer He seems to know Ludlow and dislikes
him

LUDLOW (contd)
Did I interrupt something

Malcolm turns back to Hammond

MALCOLM
Find someone else

CUT TO
INT HAMMONDS APARTMENTFOYER - NIGHT

In the foyer LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat just a trifle
rudely and shepherds him to the door

LUDLOW
So you two were just uh telling
old campfire stories were you

MALCOLM
Do me a favor Dont pretend for a
second that you and I dont know the
truth You can convince Time
magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
of whatever you want but I was
there

LUDLOW
You signed a non-disclosure agreement
before you went to the island that
expressly forbade you from discussing
anything you saw You violated that
agreement

MALCOLM
You cost me my livelihood That on
which I relied to support my
children

LUDLOW
If your university felt you were
causing it embarrassment by selling
wild stories to Hard Copy I hardly
see how I am to--

MALCOLM
I didnt tell anything I told the
truth

LUDLOW

You version of it

MALCOLM
There are no versions of the truth
This isnt a corporate maneuver its
my life

LUDLOW
We made a generous compensatory offer
for your injuries

MALCOLM
It was a payoff and an insult InGen
never-—

LUDLOW

InGen is my livelihood Dr

Malcolm and I will jealously defend
its interests People will know what
I want them to know when I want them
to know it

Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm hard It sails across the
foyer upright and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with

one hand Its his cane

LUDLOW (contd)
Dont forget that

Malcolm stares at him for a long moment Finally he turns
and walks away

But he does not out of the apartment Instead he

walks directly past Ludlow crosses the living room and steps
back into Hammonds bedroom closing the door behind him with
a determined CLICK

INT HAMMONDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

HAMMOND looks up hopeful as MALCOLM comes back into the room
and walks over to his bed He reaches down --

-- and picks up the file folder

MALCOLM
Do you have a satellite phone

INT MOMBASSA BAR - DAY
ROLAND TEMBO late sixties skin like leather and the diamond
hard look of a cobra sits at a table in the middle of an
African cafebar in Mombassa
Its daytime and the place is half full mostly with locals
but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too Americans on

safari who somehow found the local handout

Theyre a noisy bunch but Roland tunes them out calmly
eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book
eyeglasses hanging low on his nose

Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow He looks
up He SNIFFS the air once then smiles and calls out a
persons name

ROLAND
Ajay

He turns around AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU a wiry East Indian in
his late forties is standing behind him caught trying to
sneak up

AJAY
(delighted)
How did you know

ROLAND
(taps his nose)
That cheap aftershave I send you
every Christmas you actually wear
it Im touched Sit down sit
down what brings you to Mombassa

AJAY
You Tell me Roland when was the
last time you answered your phone

ROLAND
Last time I plugged it in I suppose
Why

Behind them the group of TOURISTS all men laughs loudly
One of them the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS berates the WAITRESS

AJAY
I got a call from a gentleman whos
going to Costa Rica or thereabouts
If hes to be believed its a most
uh unique expedition And very
well-funded

ROLAND
Well Im a very well-funded old son
of a bitch You go

The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress His
buddies LAUGHS Roland throws a glance annoyed

AJAY
But alone We always had great
success together you and I

ROLAND
Just a little bit too much I
think
AJAY
How do you mean

ROLAND
A true hunter doesnt mind if the
animal wins If it escapes But
there werent enough escapes from you
and me Ajay Ive decided to spend
a bit less time in the company of
death Maybe I just feel too close
to it my--

The Waitress comes to the Tourists table and the Most
Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass Roland is out of his
chair in a second

ROLAND (contd)
(to Ajay)
Excuse me

Romand walks over to the Tourists table says something to
the Waitress in the local dialect and she walks away behind
him He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist

ROLAND (contd)
You sir -- are no gentleman

TOURIST
Is that supposed to be an insult

ROLAND
I can think of none greater

The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs

TOURIST
Buzz off you silly old bastard

ROLAND
What do I have to do to pick a fight
with you bring your mother into it

TOURIST
Are you kidding I could take you

with one arm tied down

ROLAND
Really

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR
the Waiter finishes tying a mans wrist to his belt in the
back of his pants with a napkin He pulls the knot tight and

the man turns around

Its Roland with his arm tied down The Tourist stands
across from him

TOURIST
I mean my arm

POW Roland punches him square in the jaw The Tourist
reels stunned Enraged he lunges at Roland swinging with
both arms

Roland bobs neatly ducking the punches waits for the Tourist
to turn around and POPS him thrice in the face The Tourist
spins and goes down to the floor face first A cloud of
sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar

BACK AT HIS TABLE

Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
Ajay In the background the Tourists Buddies hurriedly
carry their fallen cohort out of the bar

ROLAND
Sorry We were saying

AJAY
You broke that idiots jaw for no
reason other than your boredom Tell
the truth Roland Arent you even
interested in knowing this
expeditions quarry

ROLAND
Ajay Go on up to my ranch take a
look around the trophy room and tell
me what kind of quarry you think
could possibly be of any interest
to me

Ajay just smiles

EXT AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green
seen through night-vision goggles An ANIMAL YELP comes from
the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it The
world blurs momentarily then comes into focus on a field of
long grass

The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
stealthily through it One animal head pops up above the
grass for a split-second teeth bared a white stripe between
its eyes SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face

SARAH
Hyenas Ace Face is the striped
snout
Sarah is thirty with a compact athletic body built for the
outdoors She loos through the goggles again sweeping ahead
of the hyenas to their prey

Its a herd of African buffalo standing belly-deep in the
grass agitated bellowing and stamping their feet

Sarah turns to MAKENA her African assistant

SARAH (contd)
Theyll try to take down a calf
Come on

MAKENA
Closer

Sarah scurries up and over a rock face Makena follows
Closer now they watch as the hyenas rush the herd running
through it trying to break it up

MAKENA (contd)
You know we could see everything
from up on the edge of that cliff

SARAH
No way

MAKENA
But the view would --

SARAH
No cliffs
(into a pocket recorder)
Fl headed sough F2 and F5 flanking
twenty yards F3 center F6
circling wide east Cant see F7

While she talks breathless fascinated by the drama before
her Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action
Makena follows with growing unease

MAKENA
Sarah

SARAH
F8 circling north Fl straight
through disrupting Herd moving
stamping Theres F7 Straight
through F8 angling through from the
north

Shes practically on top of the animals now

MAKENA
Dr Harding
Makena has a hold of Sarahs sweatshirt and is tugging her
back at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah
wide-eyed with fascination creeps even closer

Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
in front of them rips apart trampled under the feet of the
hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf They
yelp and jump their muzzles bloody

The adults move aside making room as the hyena pups come
forward squealing to get at the kill Sarahs eyes shine
with excitement and she moves even closer whispering into the
tape recorder

SARAH
Brooding behavior in evidence at the
kill site pups are ushered forward
and adults help them eat pulling
flesh away from the carcass and--

A telephone rings

Sarah stops in mid-sentence unsure if she heard what she
thought she heard It rings again the unmistakable CHIRPING
of a cellular phone Sarah and Makena both move at once
pawing at a backpack

SARAH (contd)
(a frantic whisper)
I thought you turned it off

Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone
Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation

SARAH (contd)
Yes

Someone speaks on the other end Sarah rolls her eyes

SARAH (contd)
Ian This better be important

Sarah doesnt say anything for a long moment just listens as
the voice on the other end talks And talks

INT MAIN FLOOR - DAY

While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
background KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
the windows Theyre all made of tempered glass fine wire
mesh inside it She looks around to see if anybodys
watching Theyre not so she quickly slips inside the front
trailer

INT TRAILER - DAY

Inside the trailer is a miracle of planning and design Its
divided into sections for different laboratory functions
The main area is a biological lab with specimen trays
dissecting pans and microscopes that connect to video
monitors

Next to it theres an extensive computer section a bank of
processors and a communications section All the lab
equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
slides into the walls Everything is bolted down

She notices a large map on the wall Off the coat of Costa
Rica there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
ink

Kelly puts a finger on the map crossing westward through the
Pacific Ocean Thegre are dozen s of islands out here but in
the highlighted region there is a semi-circle of five
Matanceros Muerte Tacano Pena And Sorna Underneath
the whole island chain there is a bold legend

The Five Deaths it says

Slowly an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
face of the map leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
of those three ominous words

DISSOLVE TO
EXT OPEN SEA - DAY

The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
five foot ocean swells in the open sea The barge is crammed
with equipment the AAV trailers a jeep and the members of
Malcolms team

ON THE BOAT

MALCOLM stands in the bow riding the choppy seas Next to
him DR JUTTSON fortyish holds onto the railing
seasick He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boats engines

JUTTISON
(as the waves pound the
boat)
Couldnt -- we just -- airlift --
into the -- island

MALCOLM
Dr Harding insisted we go by sea
Helicopters are too disruptive
These arent piles of bones youll be
studying this time Dr Juttson they
live they breathe and they react

Juttson looks at him skeptically --

-- and throws up
AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT

NICK VAN OWEN a good-looking American in his late
twenties is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
photographic equipment playing with a Game Bow SARAH
HARDING dressed in field gear sits down next to him

SARAH
So whats your story Nick

NICK
I was a cameraman for Nightline for
six years been freelance since 91
Do a lot of work for Greenpeace

SARAH
That must be interesting What drew
you there

NICK
Women Bout eighty percent female
in Greenpeace

SARAH

Very noble of you

(of the noisy Game Boy)
You dont think youre bringing that
thing onto the island do you

Nick grins and shuts it off

NICK
Hey I wouldnt want to spook the
woolly mammoths

SARAH
You think this is all a joke

NICK
Oh please How am I supposed to
keep a straight face when --
(gestures to the
black-clad Malcolm)
-- Johnny Cash here tells me Im
going to Skull Island

SARAH
(not amused)
Ians a very good friend of mine

NICK
He doesnt need a friend he needs a
shrink

SARAH

I believe in him
But her face says even she has her doubts

NICK
Come on theres only one reason any
of us are here His check cleared

She looks at him

SARAH
Drop the cynical pose You cant
pull it off while playing Donkey
Kong

The boats CAPTAIN a Costa Rican points ahead and SHOUTS to
them

CAPTAIN
There it is

They all turn and look out over the bow Up ahead shear
reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
the fog-heavy ocean

CAPTAIN (contd)
Isla Sorna

The boat ROARS ahead plowing into a heavy wreath of fog The
mist swirls and encircles it

EXT ISLAND FIORD - DAY

A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs leading to the
island interior The barge bursts through the fog at the
mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island

EXT LAGOON - DAY

Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon
Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground bleaching the
nearby foliage white In the distance one can hear the cries
of JUNGLE BIRDS

The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
AAV the jeep and the trailers The trucks back down a
narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
lagoon There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
clay at the waters edge and the AAV backs right over it
swapping its track for the animals

MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN

MALCOLM
Be back in three days but keep the
satellite phone on and your radio
tuned to the frequency I specified in
case we need you sooner
CAPTAIN
Dont worry Ive lived around here
all my life these islands are
completely --

In the distance they hear the faint strange ROAR of a very
large animal The Captain looks at Malcolm eyes wide

CAPTAIN (contd)
-- safe

CUT TO
EXT GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
just beyond the lagoon overlooking the interior of the
island The noon sun is high overhead below the valley
shimmers in midday heat

EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeeps power winch and
flicks it on The cable turns slowly in the sunlight Moving
along the length of it we see the cable leads to a pile of
aluminum some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
color

As the winch pulls the cable tight the jumble of thin struts
begins to move slowly rising into the air The emerging
structure climbs spidery struts unfolding fifteen feet into
the air The light house at the top (the cage that was

tested back at Eddies workshop) is now just beneath the
lowest branches of the nearby trees which almost conceal it
from view

NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
ground Malcolm notices

MALCOLM
Listen I know you all have probably
concluded that Im out of my mind

Is it our imagination or did the trees behind Malcolm just
sway slightly

MALCOLM (contd)
Thats all right for now But just
humor me and be careful

No its not our imagination there they go again Whole
trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
again

MALCOLM (contd)
Even if you think Im harmless and

deluded I promise --

Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway Everyone has seen
it and now Malcolm turns around too

MALCOLM (contd)
-- this place is for real

CUT TO
INT DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

Its quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
postliving quarters The books are lined up neatly on the
shelves The computers sit booted up and awaiting data
input

All the way in the back past the spare tires and life
preservers and canned food and bottled water up in one
storage bin all the way on top theres a RUSTLING SOUND

A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
bins door A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
the card is visible -- its Kelly Malcolms twelve-year-old
daughter

The card wriggles against the lock and with a soft CLICK the
door pops open KELLY herself tumbles out wrapped in several
blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
liquid We can guess

She leaps to her feet blinks the light out of her eyes and
bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can
She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut

A sign on the door says RESTROOM Inside a SIGH of relief
is heard

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

Along a stream bed the jungle trees still shiver NICK loads
a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
chews anxiously on a piece of gum SARAH and DR JUTTSON are
beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
trees to their right

At the rear EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side Eddie is
carrying a heavy silver rifle an aluminum canister hanging
beneath the barrel He shows it to Malcolm his voice low and
urgent

EDDIE
Lindstradt air rifle Fires a
subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart

He cracks open the cartridge bank revealing a row of plastic
containers filled with straw-colored liquid Each is tipped
with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
tag -- EXTREME DANGER LETHAL TOXICITY

From their right the shaking trees seen closer now By

walking down the stream bed the humans are

along with the animals as they move in the foliage

MALCOLM
(to Eddie)
Is there an antidote

EDDIE
Like if you shoot yourself in the
foot Wouldnt matter Youd be
dead before you realized youd
accidentally pulled the trigger

Ahead of them thick foliage blocks the pat

of the dried up

stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet But around
them the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer the swaying
trees shiver right beside them Eddie raises the rifle in

defense as the trees right at the edge of t

e stream bed sway

and part Above the foliage they see the sudden

movement --

-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins The spade-s
along a ridge down the middle of the animal

aped fins run
s back about

three feet tall each The group freezes amazed and as the

stegosaur continues on they get a good loo

EDDIE

SARAH
Its beautiful

A second stegosaur a baby about a quarter the size of the
first animal breaks through the foliage following the adult

While the group is reaching to that the earth vibrates and
a third stego by far the biggest of the three walks out of
the foliage right behind them crossing within ten feet

Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
environment the stegos continue on across the stream bed

Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures Her shutter
is muted so that a muffled CLICK is all thats audible

Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
it breathlessly

JUTTSON
Stegosaurus family Stegosauridae
infraorder Stegosauria suborder
Thyreophora Length adult male
estimate twenty-five to thirty feet

His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter of all
things as he cant contain his astonishment Eddie covers
his mouth trying to keep him quiet

SARAH
(to Juttsn)
That was a pair bond A family
group even long after that infant
was nestbound

JUTTSON
I want to see the nesting ground

Nick turns to Malcolm eyes like saucers and makes a futile
wordless boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture Malcolm
smiles leans over and TAPS softly on Nicks video camera
Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
continues on into the bush after the animals

IN THE BUSH

the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
where Sarah crouches in the bushes Sarah raises her camera
again and silently SNAPS a picture She WHISPERS to Juttson
who is beside her

SARAH
Lone nest -- not colonial I dont

see an egg clutch

She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
glasses

JUTTSON
(whispering back
The empty shells are crushed and
trampled The young stay in the
birth environment thats conclusive

SARAH
Not without a shot of the nest

She sees an opportunity As the baby heads back to its
parents Sarah scoots right along with it moving behind it
using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
other two

Nick and Eddies faces whiten in alarm Nick reaches out to
stop her but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
clearing

IN THE CLEARING

Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back
toward the nest chewing the branches it carries in its south
She raises up sightly squeezing off pictures of the herd
ever better as she gets closer

BACK AT THE HILL
the others can only watch her aghast

NICK
Shes gutty

MALCOLM
Shes nuts

IN THE CLEARING

Sarah keeps moving closer The baby passes a small grouping
of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them Shes now in a perfect
position to photograph the nest and she squeezes off picture
after picture from this ideal vantage point

She shoots the last picture on the roll --

-- and the cameras autowinder WHIRS to life Sarah looks
down in horror as the cameras motor WHINES loudly in her
hands

Th noise startles the animals The male turns toward her
the plates on its back bristling Sarah gets to her feet and
starts to move away slowly

The male turns away from her and swings its tail spikes
extended It WHIZZES through the air right at her but Sarah
leaps back at the last second --
-- and the tails spikes THUD into the dirt where she was

Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
away disappearing into the bush moving surprisingly quickly
for animals their size

The others run to Sarah help her to her feet and pull her
back against a massive tree trunk But the tree trunk lifts
right up off the ground

Its no tree its a DINOSAURS LEG a massive one six feet
across God knows how many feet high The Group gasps and
looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS an enormous saurupod over a
hundred feet from nose to tail lumbers away from them

The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
HONKS furtively its long neck stretched out above them

Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the

surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first The
first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle getting
into position behind the second

Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating

The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
come together and trees start snapping and falling CRASHING
to the jungle floor

The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place

ere the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath

W
the animals

Amid HONKS and BLEATS the swinging tails continue to deforest
the jungle around them

The noise and chaos is deafening drowning out the LAUGHTER
and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group

There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
underneath the animals disappearing into the thick forest

A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY

the Group collapses to the ground breathless chests heaving

with wild frightened laughter Sarah goes to Malcolm and
throws her arms around him exhilarated
SARAH
Ian youre not insane Im so
glad
JUTTSON

(out of breath)
Dr Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
an apology

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

Suddenly the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
seriously They march quickly back to base camp their energy
and excitement palpable NICK strikes a match and raises it

to a cigarette with a shaking hand but SARAH leans in and
blows it out

SARAH
No more smoking We leave no scent
of any kind No hair tonics no
cologne seal all our food in plastic
bags We will observe and document
but we will not interact

MALCOLM
Thats a scientific impossibility
you know Heisenberg uncertainty
principle Whatever you study you
also change

Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
sharpie to label it

NICK
What should I call this Jurassic
Pork

Eddie next to him laughs

SARAH
(still to Malcolm)
And lets forget about the high hide
We cant do this kind of work up ina
tower we need to be out in the
field as close to the animals as
possible

JUTTSON
Im not surprised stegosaur lived in
a family group but theres never
been anything in the fossil record to
prove the carnivores did

SARAH
Why wouldnt they Look at hyenas
jackals nearly all species of
predator birds --

JUTTSON
That doesnt say a thing about T-rex
they could have been rogues Robert
Burke certainly thinks they were

SARAH
Weve got to see one to find out
Is there any --

MALCOLM
No way

NICK
Oh my God

SARAH

-- way we could safely --

NICK
Oh no

He takes off running as fast as he can down the trail
toward base camp They look ahead in the direction Nick is
running A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees

EDDIE
Fire

CUT TO
EXT BASE CAMP - DAY
NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
of smoke In the middle of the base camp someone has neatly
built a campfire surrounded by stones Flames burn in the

middle

Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
from the trees behind him

MALCOLM
A campfire

Nick grabs a jug of water but Sarah steps in
SARAH
No Water mixes the smoke billow

use dirt

They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
hands and feet Eddie and Dr Juttson jump in and help out

MALCOLM
Who the hell started a campfire

VOICE (os)
It was just to make lunch

Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice KELLY stands in
the doorway of the trailer sheepish
KELLY (contd)
I wanted it ready when you got back

The whole group stares stunned none more so than Malcolm
himself

MALCOLM
Oh man

CUT TO
EXT BASE CAMP - LATER

Later and base camp is a blur of activity SARAH JUTTSON
NICK and EDDIE are hard at work burying the remains of the
fire sealing their food in plastic bags loading camera
equipment packing up specimen containers and other
information-gathering equipment

MALCOLM meanwhile is lecturing Kelly

MALCOLM
You know you were putting yourself in
a potentially dangerous situation
but you didnt bother to find out
how dangerous before you leapt in
You dont have the faintest idea
whats going on on this island

SARAH
(loading a backpack
What do you want to do Ian lock her
up for curiosity Where do you think
she gets it

JUTTSON
(to Nick)
Do you have chromium tapes The
others fog in high-

NICK
-humidity I know
(waving a tape)
Highest lead density on the market

EDDIE
(to Malcolm)
Weve got a lot of heavy marching
ahead of us Im not carrying
anybody

KELLY
I can keep up

MALCOLM
Youre going home Im sending a
radio call for the boats Well all
go down to the lagoon and wait for

them

SARAH

Lighten up Ian you sound like a

high school vice-principal

MALCOLM
Im her father

KELLY
Sure now

Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie
and Kelly

NICK

gesturing to Malcolm

Do you see any family resemblance

here

MALCOLM

You cant stay Kelly thats it

Its too dangerous

SARAH

If its so dangerous whyd you bring

any of us

KELLY
Youre wrong Dad I do know

whats going on on this island

MALCOLM
How could you possibly

KELLY

Because you said so Maybe nobody

else believed you but I always

did

He looks at her touched Nick mutters to Eddie again

NICK

The kid scores with cheap sentiment

SARAH

Ian if we recall the boat now

weve

made two invasive landings in one
day Thatll have to go in any paper
I write and it will leave room for
people to say our findings were
contaminated You know the academic
world as well as I do once they
smell blood in the water youre
dead Our presence has got to be one
hundred percent antiseptic That
means if we bend a blade of grass we
bend it right back the way it-

A low sound has been rising while she speaks and now it comes
BOOMING over the jungle around them a THUNDEROUS racket that
shakes the very ground beneath them Suddenly three C-130
military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
island interior flying very low The planes are enormous
fat-assed creatures their rear cargo doors hanging open

AT A RIDGE

the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
over a ledge watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
specific spot

Eddie raises a pair of field glasses
DOWN BELOW

huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
cargo bays They SNAP off trees like matchsticks CRUSH flat
anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land

Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes their low-altitude
parachutes billowing open behind them

UP ON THE RIDGE
Nick looks at Sarah

NICK
You were saying something about
antiseptic

CUT TO
EXT HUNTERS CAMP - DAY

Metal container doors CLANG to the ground jeep engines ROAR
to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke blue laser
barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp

PETER LUDLOW dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
wear steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
surroundings He turns to DR ROBERT BURKE a ragged
pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses

LUDLOW

Welcome to your dream come true Dr
Burke

Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
he spreads out on the hood of a jeep

BURKE
I believe the large herbivores forage
in open plains like bison which
would explain the great variety of
heat dots were reading in the
flatlands around this waterhole
Right -- here

LUDLOW
Then thats where were going

Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
times Inside there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
underneath As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
container Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
dashboard

BURKE
(calling them off
Hadrosaurus Carinthosaurus
Maiasaurus

As the procession goes on Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK the
man we saw welding earlier

LUDLOW
This is as good a place as any for
base camp First priority is the
laser barriers I want them all up
and running in thirty minutes Half
an hour understand

Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS who number about
twenty in all that are working nearby But someone steps in
front of Dieter cutting him off Its ROLAND TEMBO the
hunter from the bar in Mombassa

ROLAND
Cancel that Dieter

LUDLOW
What Why

Roland points to a stream running nearby

ROLAND
Carnivores hunt near stream beds Do
you want to set up base camp or an
all-you-can-eat people bar

LUDLOW
(thinks)
You heard his Dieter Find a new
spot And remember were after
herbivores only -- no unnecessary
risks
Dieter SIGHS and goes to work Roland puts an arm around
Ludlow and pulls him aside

ROLAND
Peter if you want me to run your
little camping trip there are two
conditions First -- Im in
harge and when Im not around
jeter is Your job is to sign the
hecks tell us were doing a good
ob and open your case of scotch
hen we have a good day Second
ondition -- my fee You can keep
t All I want in exchange for my
ervices is the right to hunt one of
he tyrannosaurs A male Buck
nly Why and how are my business
f you dont like either of those
onditions youre on your own Go
head and set up your camp right
here or in a swamp or in the middle
of a rex nest for all I care But
Ive been on too many safaris with
rich dentists to listen to any more
suicidal ideas Okay

MQAHOtTHHRA FUQKDA

LUDLOW
(what else can he say)
Okay
ROLAND
Good lad

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE

The jungle foliage shivers quakes and finally falls as the
Hunters convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle DIETER
STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle the
speedbird waving the convoy forward his Driver (CARTER) at
the wheel beside him

LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR BURKE
ROLAND and AJAY his tracker are in the second jeep They
look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
stops forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well

In the front the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
front of it Dieter climbs out plainly irritated He walks
around the front of the car and sees --

-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
jungle trail Theyre about five feet tall thick heavy-set
animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing
a tall impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
heads Dieter doesnt seem impressed He looks back at
Ludlow who look at Dr Burke
Burke stands up in his seat a look of wonder on his face

BURKE
Pachycephalosaurus

LUDLOW
Carnivore
BURKE
(enchanted)

Huh No No herbivore late
Cretaceous Very unusual plant
eater see that distinctive domed
skull Thats nine inches of solid
bone

LUDLOW
(who cares)
Just get them out of the way Dieter

DIETER
COME ON MOVE IT

The pachys look up at him sluggishly still eating like cows
chewing their cuds As unimpressive with him as he is with
them they go back to their grass

DIETER (contd)
Oh for Gods --

He slings his rifle off his shoulder and aims it at the
closest animal Behind him Roland has climbed out of the
second jeep

ROLAND
Dieter This is a round-up not a
war Use your powers of persuasion

Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead which it does
slowly toward the animals The pachys look up alert but do
not move Dieter walks toward them

DIETER
Come on come on dont have all
day
BURKE
(going on to no one in
particular)

See the pachys neck attaches at the
bottom of its skull instead of the
back of its head as with reptiles

The speedbird draws closer The first pachy stares at it
intently The lead vehicle gets closer closer --
-- and BANGS into the pachy knocking it back a few feet out
of the way

BURKE (contd)
So when it lowers its head its neck
lines up directly with its
backbone --

BEHIND DIETER

Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet He
takes a few steps further into the foliage then turns back
toward Roland

AJAY
Roland

UP AT THE FRONT

the pachys turn and hop away Dieter turns and heads back to
the speedbird As he reaches for the door a VOICE calls
look out from behind him Dieter spins around just in
time to see --

-- the first pachy in full charge It SLAMS headfirst into
the speedbird SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill

BURKE
(concluding his lecture)
Which is perfect for absorbing
impact

Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car The
pachy has backed up for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
AT HIM

Dieter retreats quickly and rips open the passenger door to
protect himself

SLAM The pachy clobbers the door sending Dieter flying
against the car knocking the wind out of him

In the other jeeps the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
out the window for a better look laughing

POW The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter It
bounces off tumbles to the ground and rolls to its feet as
Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
speedbird

But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again Hes
forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
speedbird just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
vehicle

Now the other three animals join the jun Ludlow and the
Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
car again and again SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
MANGLING the quarter panels The rest of the group watches
vastly amused

A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE

Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
animal footprint three-toed enormous

AJAY
It matches the pictures

ROLAND
It certainly does

Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle ignoring the
pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird
Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep revealing --

-- his gun Its an antique elephant gun a double barreled
-600 Nitro Express Nearly a hundred years old its still in
immaculate condition its rosewood stock buttery smooth
bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach

The barrels are twenty-four inches long topped with an ivory
bead foresight at the business end Roland scoops up the gun
breaks the breach and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
shirt pocket

Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter
these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made
He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush

Roland pauses before he goes as if noticing the animals
trashing the speedbird for the first time

ROLAND
HEY

The pachys all freeze staring at him Roland waves one hand
HISSES sharply between his teeth --

-- and the pachys scatter back into the jungle Takes care
of that problem Roland turns and heads back into the jungle
calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow

ROLAND (contd)
Dont worry about us Well catch
up

LUDLOW
Where do you think youre going

ROLAND
To collect my fee
And with that he disappears into the foliage

The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
battered car GROANS forward As it moves ahead it reveals
DIETER lying underneath it ego bruised worse than body

IN THE JUNGLE

Ajay takes a step into the bush but at a ninety degree
angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
lead

ROLAND
Ajay

Ajay turns Roland points in the direction in which the
footprints lead

ROLAND (contd)
Im no tracker but even I can read
this spoor

AJAY
Do you wish to go where the animal
has been or where the animal is

Roland smiles Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
follows

CUT TO
EXT ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

Seen from a ridge above them the hunters convoy continues to
plow through the jungle But how the hunters themselves are
being tracked followed by the GATHERERS They scurry along
as fast as they can trying to keep pace with the moving
vehicle below

EDDIE
Why didnt you tell us about these
guys Ian

MALCOLM
Because I didnt know I dont have
the faintest idea what theyre doing
here

NICK
(angry)
Ruining everything thats what
theyre doing You could choke on
the diesel smoke already

SARAH
Ian nothing we observe will be valid
if were trailing along in the wake
of an army

Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
they move below

KELLY
InGen Whats InGen

MALCOLM
Where does it say that

KELLY
On the side of that one truck

Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself

JUTTSON
InGen is a genetics corporation
isnt it

NICK
(to Malcolm)
Is that who were really working
for Gene splicers

MALCOLM
No Were an independently funded
expedition

SARAH
Funded by whom

MALCOLM
John Hammond

JUTTSON
But hes the head of InGen

NICK
You gotta be kidding
(to Malcolm)
You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
be a corporate stooge You couldnt
get anybody else

KELLY
Yeah what have you done Dad

SARAH
Wed better keep moving or well
lose them

The group moves on ahead but Malcolm lingers angry staring
through the binoculars

MALCOLM
What are you doing to me John
CUT TO
EXT THE CAVES - DAY

AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
into a small clearing where a cluster of caves is carved into
the rock Ajay freezes gesturing ahead to the cave on the
far left

Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
breeze It floats back between his legs Thats good

He proceeds toward the cave carefully Ajay behind him They
can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave only a
black interior

Roland pauses looking down On the ground to his right he
sees the partially eastern leg of a creature Its old
crawling with white maggots and flies

Roland continues on Closer to the cave he now passes the
skull of a large animal some of the flesh and green skin
still adhering to the bone It too is covered with flies

Still he continues on A short rise leads into the cave and
they edge up it From inside the cave they can hear an odd
SQUEAKING sound very high-pitched

Crawling now Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
rampart of dried mud and peer into --

-- the tyrannosaur nest Its flattered inside about ten
feet in diameter completely encircled by earthen walls

A BABY TYRANNOSAUR about four and a half feet long is in the
center of the nest It has a large head very large eyes and
its body is covered with a fluffy red down which gives it a
scraggly appearance

It SQUEAKS repeatedly tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
chunk of animal flesh biting decisively with tiny sharp
teeth

The cave itself is a foul boneyard ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
the edges flies BUZZ in the captive air Roland raises a
bandana to his nose to cover the stench He turns to Ajay and
WHISPERS

ROLAND
Its the rex nest

Ajay nods The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
up cocking its head in curiosity

AJAY
Make a blind here Wait for the buck
to return

ROLAND
(shakes his head no)
If the nest is upwind so are we
When he comes back hell know were
here before we have a chance The
truck --

In the nest below the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders
ROLAND (contd)
-- is to get him to come where we

want him

The baby SQUEAKS again indignant Roland turns and looks
down at it Thinking

CUT TO
EXT RIDGE - DUSK
As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon NICK raises a
pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
below the ridge
In the lenses of the binoculars we can clearly see a mixed
herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS PACHYCEPHALOSAURS
and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below
MALCOLM also staring through binoculars lies on the ridge
beside him SARAH is several feet behind them her back
pressed against a tree unwilling to go to the lip of the
ridge
THROUGH NICKS BINOCULARS

We see a shaky point of view of the herd running The
binoculars whip to the right --

-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd Not just one jeep in
fact but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES

There are two herding jeeps one motorcycle as speedier
mini-jeep and further behind a container truck anda

wranglers pickup truck

Although theres a great deal of commotion below up here its
almost eerily silent

ON THE RIDGE

Nick lowers the binoculars angry When he raises them again
the sun FLARES off the lens --

EXT THE PLAIN - DUSK
-- and when the brilliant flare clears were right down in
the middle of the roundup Engines ROAR wheels spin and dig
in the dirt men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
vehicles pursue the fleeting herd theyre flushed

The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee incredulous and
thrilled by the spectacular animals theyre pursuing

HUNTER
LOOK AT THESE THINGS

HUNTER 2
THEYRE BEAUTIFUL MAN THEYRE
BEAUTIFUL

One of the pursuit vehicles (a Snagger) pulls ahead of the
others DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat holding a
long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it

He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
the driver

DIETER
FASTER

The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward gaining
on the herd Aware of the danger behind them the herd veers

to the right toward the cover of thick jungle --

-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side cutting
them off herding them back out into the open

BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK

PETER LUDLOW stands in a conning tower a command post in
the heaviest pursuit vehicle He BARKS into a walkie-talkie

LUDLOW
Alive Dieter and uninjured

BACK ON THE SNAGGER

the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
thrown by the herd ahead of him Dieter CURSES and throws the
lasso pole into the back of the jeep lLudlows voice
continues over the radio in Dieters jeep

LUDLOW (os)
Those are very expensive animals
Can you hear me

DIETER
(to the Driver)
Turn that off

The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
rifle from the back of the vehicle
THE MOTORCYCLE

guns it again forcing the herd back into the middle of the
plain From the trees to the left two heads on enormous
necks rise up in alarm Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain

The herd doesnt even break stride but keeps running
scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
massive legs

One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose but the motorcycle
cuts it off and herds it back into the middle which now takes
the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
the apotosaurs

The bike chases the pachy out the other side and as the
apatosaurs disappear into the distance the cycle isolates the
juvenile

Another truck a scissor rig spots the isolated animal
High in the back of the truck a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
cannon drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down

He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
neck Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
a lasso around its neck

They crank a winch reeling in the animal

As the truck gain on it two six-foot padded arms with what
look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
the truck

As the animal is pulled in the scissors close with a
hydraulic WHIR trapping the animal between its airbags

Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate The
scissor rig rolls forward depositing the squirming pachy in
this dino-contaiment vehicle

Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
the scissor rig backs away leaving the animal still pinched
between the bars imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig

The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
and it takes off back into the hunt

BACK ON THE SNAGGER
Dieter rifle in hand drops down into the passenger seat
whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place He

jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard

Immediately a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
seat itself telescopes extending a good four feet out to
Dieter raises the gun picks a CARINTHOSAUR a red-crested
herbivore from the rear of the fleeting herd and takes aim

BANG

The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
its left hindquarter

UP ON THE RIDGE

there is utter quiet Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
the spectacle below

DOWN ON THE PLAIN

the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt kicking up a huge
cloud of dust and dirt

The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it its DRIVER pushing
his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face

The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door which
CLANGS heavily to the ground

FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
the ramp and out of the truck

Dieter jumps off the snagger He puts down his tranquilizer
gun picks up a long steel rod and walks forward slowly
Ahead of him the carinthosaur is still on its feet

The sedated animal staggers fighting to retain its balance
while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers

DIETER
Easy -- easy -- not too close
Full extension
The Wranglers adjust their poles extending them another three
feet which allows them to stay further from the reeling ten
foot tall animal

DIETER (contd)
Now

Almost as one the Wranglers flip their noose over the
stunned animals neck It thrashes but the Wranglers hold
their poles tightly surrounding and immobilizing it

UP ON THE RIDGE

Nick turns away He cant watch

DOWN ON THE PLAIN

a bolero-type device a rope with a round weight at either
end whips around the carinthosaurs legs The animal THUDS
to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat

Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
the helpless animal Ludlows breathing heavily eyes
glowing

The animal is still thrashing pumping its legs crazily
Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod hes holding
and thrusts it into the defenseless animals neck

A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
carinthosaurs body The animal convulses in pain a
horrible high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air

DR BURKE their paleontologist hurries forward with a
syringe

He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
injects it into the animals thigh

CARTER Dieters Driver steps up with a can of spray paint
and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
orange

Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
the animal

DIETER
Next case

CUT TO
EXT RIDGE - NIGHT

Night has fallen over the island The hunters have
established base camp in an area they have trampled and
cleared just below the ridge Blue laser fences encircle the
perimeter Inside half a dozen tents are set up around a
central campfire

The vehicles are all parked at one end away from the tents
At the other end there is a row of at least a dozen capture
containers cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
have already rounded up

SARAH MALCOLM and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above
looking down at the scene Sarah stands a bit further back
from the others not wanting to get too close to the edge
VOICES waft up to them raucous LAUGHING some even SINGING

DR JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
the cages

JUTTSON
Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
or small scavengers only

Malcolm also with binoculars furrows his brow seeing
something below

THROUGH MALCOLMS BINOCULARS

he sees PETER LUDLOW standing in the middle of the camp
pointing giving orders

ON THE RIDGE
Malcolm drops the binoculars

MALCOLM
Ludlow Thats why Hammond was in
such a hurry for me to get here He
knew they were coming

He gives the binoculars to Sarah who moves forward gingerly

MALCOLM (contd)
You okay

SARAH
(irritated)
Heights I cant help it Put your
arm here will you

She puts his arm around her waits to steady her while she is
close to the cliff edge

JUTTSON
What do they want

MALCOLM
hey want their money back To
InGen this island is nothing more
han a bed investment

past the fire

She hands the binoculars to Malcolm

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
Malcolm

sees ROLAND whos walking with AJAY weapons and

equipment slung over their shoulders

BACK ON

SARAH (0S)

philosopher Kind of guy who beats
you up with your own argument

THE RIDGE

SARAH (contd)
Hes the one in charge

MALCOLM
Well if thats true -- the man in

Nick who has been quietly fuming next to them now steps

forward

He rummages through his pack coming up with various tools

NICK
Then this is our chance

MALCOLM
Our chance to do what

NICK
I dont know these guys but I know

CUT TO
INT TENT - HUNTERS CAMP - NIGHT

In the hunters supply tent a case of twelve-year-old scotch
sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition
PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

In the jungle LUDLOW approaches a small clearing ROLAND is
bent over a small stake in the ground chaining something to
it As Ludlow approaches and walks around him he sees what
protest Roland looks up

ROLAND
Offering a little incentive

Ludlow laughs and shakes his head He takes a drink and
offers Roland one Roland accepts Ludlow notices Rolands
gun leaning against a tree

LUDLOW
What kind of gun is that

ROLAND
My fathers 600 Nitro Express Made
in 1904 Karimojo Bell gave it to
him after he took down his last
elephant 8700 foot pound striking
force

LUDLOW
How close do you have to be

ROLAND
Forty yards Less maybe I assume
itll take a slug in the brain case
to bring him down

LUDLOW
Why not just use a scope and a poison

dart and snipe him from a hill

Roland just looks at him
ROLAND
Or a laser beam from a satellite

Ludlow leans down close to the baby rex and examines it
while it thrashes on its chain Its mouth has been bound shut
with a leather strap

LUDLOW
You rally think thisll draw the
parent

ROLAND

I once saw a bull elephant die

charging a jeep All the jeep had
done was startle the bulls calves
I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
four and a half miles all the way
back to its den just to teach its
cubs how to finish off a kill

LUDLOW
Killing lessons Heartwarming

ROLAND
Rex wont be any different Itll
come

LUDLOW

Youre kidding yourself An adult
T-rex cares about one thing --
filling its own belly It acts the
way people wish they could thats
why everyones fascinated by it If
people had the chance to see one
dinosaur and one only ninety-nine
percent would --

He stops an idea on his face

LUDLOW (contd)
Wait Why not Sedatives
growth inhibitors

ROLAND
What

LUDLOW

I hadnt planned on bringing
carnivores back because of the
liability risk but I only thought of
adults it never occurred to me --

(close to the animal)
You are a billion dollar idea my
little f-

CRACK The tyrannosaur even with its jaws clamped shut
lunges at Ludlows face head-butting him right across the
bridge of the nose Ludlow staggers back WAITING in pain
clutching his bleeding face

Roland laughs Ludlow like an enraged child snatches up
Rolands gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rexs
leg The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
pain

Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground but the damage
is done

ROLAND
What the hell you do that for

As his pain eases Ludlow feels a bit foolish but he attempts
to cover

LUDLOW
Had to To keep him still for the
trip

ROLAND

Youve broken its leg

LUDLOW
Weve got to transport it seven
thousand miles Would you prefer it
bit off the leg of a crew member

He gets up brushes himself off and heads back to the camp
trying to salvage his dignity Roland watches him go

CUT TO
EXT EDGE OF HUNTERS CAMP - NIGHT

At the edge of the hunters camp NICK SARAH and MALCOLM
scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
barriers There are three beams each about two feet apart
the tallest almost six feet off the ground

Nick reaches the edge and crouches Sarah helped by Malcolm
steps up onto his back and jumps over the top landing with a
CRUNCH Nick is next given a boost by Malcolm who is then
left alone on the other side

He backs up a few steps jogs right at the lasers then
springs off his good leg --

-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top He lands
with a THUD to the silent admiration of the other two

FURTHER IN THE CAMP

the three of them creep along hiding behind a stack of fuel
barrels They lean around the edge for a look Theyre
directly behind the row of vehicle

They move into the open covering the ground between them and
the jeeps Reaching them Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
under the first one Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout

UNDER THE JEEP

Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket He squirms
along until he finds the jeeps fuel line --

-- and he snips it He ducks out of the way just as the
stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt

MALCOLM AND SARAH

move slowly down the line standing watch as Nick crawls out
from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second They
hear another SNIP then keep moving to cover him as he moves
to the third

From in the distance Malcolm hears a sound a faint
high-pitched SCREECHING He turns and looks to that
direction

EXT JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

Its the baby T-rex still SCREENING Up in a nearby tree
ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground

They wait

Roland raises his binoculars The light of the camp spills
all the way out here illuminating some of the jungle He
scans it searching for any sign of movement

EXT HUNTERS CAMP - NIGHT

Back in the camp Sarah Malcolm and Nick have finished with
all of the vehicles except the badly battered one which is
parked some distance away undergoing repairs The motor pool
area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline

The saboteurs walk casually across the camp unnoticed in the
drunken revelry They pass several tents the shadows of the
partiers visible as they move inside

They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

-- to face the caged animals The carinthosaur that was
tranquilized earlier stands there dully eyes heavy and
glassy still under the effects They pass a stegosaur its
row of fine bristling

And finally they reach the largest cage which houses a
triceratops the size of a pickup truck Nick pulls out his
trusty bolt cutters He looks at them a glint in his eye

NICK
Hang on We may encounter some
turbulence

INT HUNTERS CAMP - NIGHT

In one of the hunter tents PETER LUDLOW leans over the
satellite recon pictures of the island planning the next
days assault with DIETER and DR BURKE their paleontologist
There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
photos indicating where certain species can be found

BURKE
If youre really interested in
infants well have better luck at
the seaside because the sands offer
a cushioning surface where the egg
clutches can -- can --

He trails off A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside and
the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board

They look at each other The RUMBLING gets louder Outside
someone SHOUTS on the board the little dinosaurs start
hopping and bouncing from the vibrations the SHOUTS outside
turn to SCREAMS they turn and look at the back of the tent --

-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas
EXT CAMP - NIGHT

HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops its horns
tearing through the canvas RUMBLES across the camp Men
SHOUT in alarm the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
confusion chaos reigns

In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way MALCOLM and
SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
in another They SHOUT but cannot be heard over the frey

The triceratops blinded by the canvas shroud stomps right
through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
INTO FLAME

Now really upset the animal panics and lashes out in all
directions blasting through tents demolishing andor setting
ablaze anything that gets in its way Its considerable
hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep sending it rolling
across the camp

The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side
Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground the gas hits
one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
its wake and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas
The jeep explodes
OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING

Roland and Ajay up in the tree leap to their feet as a
fireball rises up from the camp in the distance

ROLAND
What in Gods --

BACK IN THE CAMP

the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
camp The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
animals

AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP

Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
direction while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other

The burning tent which was the equipment tent now detonates
in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS

Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
series of concessive blasts He drags himself up onto all
fours charred and bruised A burning tire rolls slowly past
him spinning to a stop --

-- at ROLANDs feet Dieter looks up at him

ROLAND
Last time I leave you in charge

OUT IN THE JUNGLE

Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing the same one where
Ajay and Roland had their blind He sees the baby tyrannosaur
chained to the stake

NICK
Sick bastards

He goes to the animal which now BLEATS in pain its broken
leg hanging at an odd angle With one strong tug Nick pulls
the stake out of the ground

BACK IN THE CAMP

Roland surveys the destruction The fire has spread and
several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air
the animals are gone or going and their personnel are
scattered and terrified PETER LUDLOW breathless face
smeared with dirt and smoke staggers up to Roland
LUDLOW
What in Christs name is going on

ROLAND
Isnt it obvious

He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages

NICK (contd)
Were not alone on this island

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT
MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail where the
green AAV is parked NICK bursts around from the other side
of the car
SARAH

Nick thank God we didnt know

if --
Malcolm opens the rear door

NICK
Wait dont ---

With a piercing SHRIEK the BABY TYRANNOSAUR now in the back
of the AAV flings itself at the open doorway jaws SNAPPING

just short of Malcolms nose

MALCOLM
HOLY SHIT

He SLAMS the door
DOWN IN THE HUNTERS CAMP
Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up

ROLAND
Do we have anyone up there

BACK UP ON THE RIDGE
Malcolm is confronting Nick
MALCOLM
NICK
It has a broken leg
MALCOLM

So do it a favor and put it out of
its misery
NICK
No Get in the car before they hear
us

He runs around and leaps in the drivers seat Sarah slips
into the passenger seat quickly leaving Malcolm no choice
but the rear

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage From inside the
car we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger

INT AAV - NIGHT
The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm who has
flattened himself against the door as far away from the
animal as possible
SARAH

Ian close the window its going to

wake every predator in the jungle
Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
window The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
legs ripping the flesh of his forearm He SHOUTS in pain

Outside the listening jungle whizzes by

EXT HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

Up in the high hide EDDIE DR JUTTSON and KELLY are
standing watch scanning the jungle for any sign of their
returning comrades

Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
as he spots the AAV pulling up to the base camp a couple

hundred yards away

JUTTSON

There they are

They all turn and look but Eddie furrows his brow watching
them pull the wounded animal from the back seat

EDDIE
What is that they have with them

EXT CAMP - NIGHT
SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their

arms headed for the trailer MALCOLM holding his bleeding
arm isnt far behind
INT TRAILER - NIGHT

SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
table and hold it down MALCOLM is right behind them

MALCOLM
This is exceedingly unwise

Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies holding a
small syringe Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
babys injured leg

SARAH
Too late to worry about that Hold
him together Nick

Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
injection into its thigh over its loudly voiced objections

MALCOLM
Just do whatever you have to do and
get it out of here as quickly as
possible

Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
the animals leg A green and white skeletal image appears on
a monitor next to the table

SARAH
Okay theres the metatarsals --
tibia fibula -- there it is See
it Thats a fracture just above
the epiphysis

They peer closely at the monitor

NICK
That little black line

SARAH

That little black line means death
for this infant The fibula wont
heal straight so the ankle joint
cant pivot when he stands on his
hind feet The baby wont be able to
run and probably cant even walk
Itll be crippled and a predator
will pick it off before it gets more
than a few weeks old

MALCOLM
Can you set up

SARAH
(thinking)
It has to be temporary something
thatll break apart and fall off as
the animal grows

MALCOLM
Think fast Sarah

The tyrannosaur still in pain SHRIEKS again
EXT HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

Through their binoculars the rest of the group watches the
trailer carefully Even inside the animals SCREECHES are
clearly audible Kelly is getting scared

KELLY
What are they doing Why dont
they hurry

EDDIE
Give me the radio

From the trailer the baby lets out a long plaintive
SHRIEK --

One by one Eddie Kelly and Juttson turn around and stare
into the night jungle

INT TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin
MALCOLM at the window stares out anxiously The animal
thrashes again

NICK
Give it more morphine

SARAH
Well kill it with too much well
put it into respiratory arrest Im
almost done Damn it I need
another adhesive something pliable I
can --

Her eyes fall on Nick She holds out her hand urgently

SARAH (contd)
Spit

He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand The baby
rex CRIES OUT again

EXT HIGH HIDE - NIGHT
From the swaying jungle there is another answering ROAR

And this ones closer
In the high hide the rest of the group stares trembling In
the distance a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
tops of some trees move a whole section of forest suddenly
coming alive as if brushed by wind

But its not the wind

They hear noises THUDS in the jungle And then another
section of forest trembles Closer Another flock of birds
bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide

KELLY
What is it

Dr Juttson puts an arm around Kelly instinctively pulling
her closer to him Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
walkie-talkie

EDDIE
Sarah come in

JUTTSON
Its moving Fast

INT TRAILER - NIGHT

There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer
The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddies VOICE

EDDIE (os)
Sarah Malcolm can you hear me

On the table Sarah is frantically molding Nicks bubblegum
into place on the makeshift splint But the baby rex
regaining its strength is thrashing again

SARAH
Hold it down Nick

NICK
Im trying

EDDIE (os)
(from the radio)
Is anybody there

Malcolm moves to answer the radio but Sarah SHOUTS to him

SARAH
Tan get the bottle of amoxicillin
and fill a syringe Quick injection
of antibiotics and I can get it out
of here

Forsaking the radio Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
comes up with what she wants Working fast he draws twenty
ccs of the pink liquid
EDDIE (os)
(still from the radio now
desperate)
SARAH OR IAN ANSWER ME

They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
injection

EDDIE (os)
WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE

EXT HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
desperately

EDDIE

IN YOUR DIRECTION I REPEAT --
INT TRAILER - NIGHT

Nick Sarah and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
piece of information

MALCOLM
Oh Christ

He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button

MALCOLM (contd)
Let me talk to Kelly is she--

A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer

followed immediately by a CRASHING sound They whirl and look
to the window just in time to see --

-- the AAV tumbling by rolling on its side

There is another ROAR and the baby on the table ROARS in
response Outside the window the head of a full-grown
TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside

Malcolm Sarah and Nick all freeze in absolute terror

The rex outside GURGLES making material cooing noises The
baby rex calm for the first time GURGLES back

But across the trailer in the opposite window ANOTHER T-REX
HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS

This one ROARS deeply a roar so low and loud it rattles
anything in the trailer that isnt tied down

NICK
What do they want

MALCOLM
What do you think they want

SARAH
Thats impossible they cant have
the sensory equipment to track it all
the way here

MALCOLM
Current evidence seems to be to the
contrary wouldnt you say GIVE IT
TO THEM

Nick hands shaking grabs the shoulder video camera he used
earlier He whips out the cassette thats in there hurls it
into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others SLAMS a
fresh cassette in and flicks the ON switch

Sarah and Malcolm meanwhile hurry to the other end of the
trailer carrying the baby rex Outside the two adult rexes
stay with them walking in the same direction watching them
through the window

EXT TRAILER - NIGHT

Seen from outside the light inside the trailers clearly
illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex The
adult rexes tower over the trailer twice as tall and nearly
as long They walk slowly alongside it hunched over
watching their infant

INT TRAILER - NIGHT
At the door to the trailer Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby

SARAH
Ready

Malcolm reaches for the door handle

NICK
Wait

He dives down on the floor under them pointing the video
camera up at the door getting the best shot Malcolm takes a
breath turns the knob and throws open the door

Outside the enormous rex heads pause for a moment staring
surprised

Although terrified Sarah actually starts to sing
SARAH

(softly)
Born free as free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows --

MALCOLM
Are you insane

SARAH
I swear to God it works with lions
sometimes There we are -- your baby

is free --
The baby excited wriggles free of them and lands on the
ground outside Not wasting a second Malcolm SLAMS the door
shut
The three of them freeze not daring to breath Outside they
can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they

inspect their young --

-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps growing fainter
as they move away

From the wall EDDIES VOICE comes over the radio relieved

EDDIE
Theyre going back into the jungle

CUT TO
EXT HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

EDDIE JUTTSON and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
high hide

KELLY
Uh huh

CUT TO

MALCOLM is at the radio

MALCOLM
Wait there Ill come up ina
minute Dont move understand

KELLY (0s)
I understand

Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer SARAH and
NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall
completely drained Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
speaks shakily into it

SARAH
Note to Dr Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
rex does nurture its young

They laugh weakly

NICK

Theres uh -- theres an unwritten
rule when a news crew is in a war
zone You stop the van every two
miles and decide whether or not to go
on Whether or not you feel lucky
One no from anybody in the group
and you turn around right there no
question asked nobody embarrassed

(pause)
Well Do we go on
Immediately
SARAH
No
MALCOLM
No
NICK
No way
They all laugh
MALCOLM

All right Im satisfied with the
evidence we have right now
I feel vindicated John Hammond will
too

(to Sarah)
Do you have enough to publish

SARAH
They will come after me But I can
collect some stool samples for DNA
with that Nicks tapes and the rest
of you to back me up it should stand
when we get back

MALCOLM
(getting up)
Then the only thing left to do is
make sure we do get back Ill
call the mainland on the satellite
phone and have them send the boat
right now This expedition is over

He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
phone thats resting in a battery pack The front panel
lights up a brilliant green

But from the wall speaker the radio CRACKLES and EDDIES
VOICE breaks through soft and empty

EDDIE (os)
Oh God I am so sorry

Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box

MALCOLM
What the hell is he sorry f-

A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer Malcolm Sarah and
Nick takes a step forward from the walls looking around The
RATTLE gets louder the trailer shakes and vibrates
everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer

Theyre all thrown against the far wall there is an
earsplitting CRACK of electricity the entire trailer rocks
and sparks a brilliant blue and then everything goes black

The satellite phone flies out of Malcolms hands and SMACKS
against the wall It lands on the floor its number pad still
glowing green

Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows Outside
the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window
revealing the second tyrannosaur charging straight at the
trailer

NICK
HANG ON TO SOMETHING

They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
for dear life The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
trailer which rocks up on one side BANGS back down and is
quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal This time the
entire trailer rolls over completely upside down

Sarah Nick and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
and drop onto the ceiling The tables chairs lab equipment
everything thats bolted down clings to the floor above them
everything that isnt RAINS DOWN ON THEM

But the rexes arent done The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION
sliding forwards

SEEN FROM OUTSIDE
the upside down trailer which is the rear of the two
trailers slides along the muddy ground pushing up earth in
front of it

IN THE TRAILER

SARAH
Theyre pushing us

Malcolm frantic crawls up to a window to get a look outside
He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
as they move past it

He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
they are being pushed His eyes widen at something he sees

outside the window
MALCOLM
Oh God
SARAH
What
MALCOLM
Theyre pushing us over the cliff

Sure enough out the back window we see a few more feet of
muddy earth and then nothing but inky black The three of
them look at each other for a moment --

-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
trailer The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward They reach the
accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER

which is right-side-up Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
it pushing the front end of the trailer

IN THE REAR TRAILER

Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer but
Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
starts to roll and tumble past her headed downhill

The angle increases the trailer dips and now stuff starts to
freefall right past her some SMASHING her in the head

Malcolm still in the connecting tube grabs hold Sarah
starting to be pulled downward paws at the refrigerator
getting a g rip on the handle The door held by a safety
latch doesnt open

Below Sarah debris falls to the rear window of the trailer
Through the CRACKING glass we can see the surf CRASHING five
hundred feet below
The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall The
box strains on its power cord

Still clinging to the handle Sarah swings wildly as it starts
to come loose swaying above her

The safety latch on the door gives it swings open anda
shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
contents

Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
trailer She SCREAMS covers her head and SMASHES into the
rear window The glass spiderwebs but does not break

FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW

an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore Above Sarah is a
tiny figure sprawled out on the glass held invisibly by the
breaking window

IN THE TRAILER
Nick SHOUTS to her

NICK
SARAH DONT MOVE

Sarah stunned by the fall blinks a few times regaining her
senses She looks down at the crashing surf so far below
For a person with a fear of heights this is a real drag As
she stares the rocks seem to move even farther away from her
She blanches the world spins around her

SARAH
OH GOD please

Her breath fogs the cracked glass Slowly she tries to get
up Caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees

But as she puts pressures on her hands the glass CRACKS even
more tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers The
whole glass panel sags bowing out around the bottom of the
trailer

UP ABOVE HER

Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
balanced on one leg of the kitchen table its number pad still

glowing green Nick is closest to it

MALCOLM
Nick Grab the phone

SARAH

looks to her right at a metal grating that runs along the
wall of the trailer She shifts her weight leaning on one
hand to reach for the grating with the other

NICK

reaches for the satellite phone its antenna just six inches
from his outstretched fingers

SARAH

leans toward the metal grating all hairline cracks shoot out
around her pivot hand shaking through the glass The
splintered glass spread like a disease it reaches the edge

of the frame --

-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass She GASPS and
pulls her hand out but now she knees SMASH through the

glass

NICK

has two fingers on the phone but suddenly the whole trailer
shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls

NICK
SARAH LOOK OUT

SARAH

lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass
opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window

UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER

glass food lab equipment and the precious satellite phone
fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below

IN THE CLEANING

the trailers are split like an L the rear trailer hanging
straight down the forward one resting on the edge of the
cliff Satisfied with their work the T-rexes turn and lumber
back into the jungle

IN THE TRAILER

Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating Above her Nick
lowers himself as far as he can reaching for her

ON THE CLIFFSIDE
we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows

out from the muddy cliff

But now those branches SPLINTER
IN THE TRAILER

Malcolm sees the bellows the connector between the trailers
stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower

BELOW HIM

Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailers kitchen
inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
purchase

OUTSIDE

the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks stretching down
again The bellows expands to its full length stretching
like a Slinky

INSIDE

Nick knows he has to hurry He climbs down bouncing off the
built-in furniture moving ever closer to Sarah

But Sarah slips and loses her grip dropping a few feet She
gabs hold of the sink the flowing water spraying her face

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

EDDIE CARR is in the drivers seat of the jeep racing through
the jungle as fast as he can

EDDIE
Hang on -- hang on --

The foliage SMACKS the windshield then clears suddenly
revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
him The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
rex and SKIDS to a halt

INT TRAILER - NIGHT

Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls SMASHING into the
frame of the half-broken rear window again

OUTSIDE

Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer He
SHOUTS in through the broken front window

EDDIE
HEY HELLO

IN THE REAR TRAILER
The three look up from their precarious positions

MALCOLM
WERE IN HERE GET SOME ROPE
OUTSIDE
Eddie turns and run back to the jeep He grabs a coil of
rope secures one end around a tree and hurries back to the
trailer
IN THE REAR TRAILER
Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
into the extended connector He peers over the edge down

into the second trailer and tosses the rope

EDDIE
Catch

The rope falls through the center of the trailer its end
dangling all the way out the smashed rear window But the

trailer SHUDDERS starting to move again

SARAH
Were sliding

EDDIE
Climbs up if you can

OUTSIDE
Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff

He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
front grill

Behind him the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff
Eddie races back to the trailer pulling out a length of cable
behind him He runs up to the still-moving trailer dives for

its towing hook the cable goes taut --

-- and he falls short Just by six inches but hes out of
cable

EDDIE
Damn it

INSIDE THE TRAILER

Nick and Sarah are now together clinging to the rope near the
bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them Malcolm is
further up also clinging to the rope

OUTSIDE

dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
edge of the cliff

Eddie back at the jeep reels out more winch cable He turns
and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND

Eddie dives again and this time the cable hook CLICKS
securely into the trailers towing hook The trailer lurches
toward the edge of the cliff and stops

But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure
IN THE TRAILER

Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it but a sudden dig knocks
them back and their hands slide down the line SCREAMING
they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
the remains of the rear window

Regaining hold of the rope at the very end the two of them
now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer
dangling over the rocky shore below

IN THE JEEP

Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud trying to
get a grip The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
trailer back to earth But the tires spin fighting to hold
it there

ON THE CLIFFSIDE

Sarah and Nick dangle desperate

IN THE JEEP

Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
engine As the motor ROARS the sound is topped by another

ROAR in the distance

And this ones not a machine But Eddie doesnt hear it He
GUNS the engine again There is another ROAR from the jungle

Eddie hears this one He darts a look at the side view
mirror In it he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
the jungle behind him

He GASPS and looks at the other side view In it he sees the
OTHER REX racing toward him

The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep
The first rex bends over CHOMPS down on the rear tire and
lifts the car to its teeth

But the spinning tire LINGS in the rexs mouth burning it
Surprised by the fight in this foe the rex loses its grip and
the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground

Eddie horrified dives down under the steering wheel to get
away The gas pedal pops up --

-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff

But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape
The trailers stop

Now the rexes lean down over the jeep and focus on Eddie

who still covers under the steering wheel The first rex

SNAPS at him hitting the steering column with it leaving Eddie
fully

exposed

He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in seizing him in its
teeth and tossing him out of the car

Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes both their
heads flash at him at the same time and in a split-second he
disappears between their teeth

Now completely ignored the jeep rolls freely forward and the
trailers drop over the edge of the cliff

INSIDE THE TRAILER

Nick Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
the trailers fall around them The windows flash by as the
trailers plummet equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them but they
hold on to the rope still tied to the tree for dear life

ON THE CLIFFSIDE

the trailers slide the rest of the way exposing the three
who pop out the space where the front windshield was
Dangling from the rope they look up and see the jeep which
is now rolling to the edge of the cliff

It falls past them and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
below Finally it is silent except for the sound of the
surf

EXT CLEARING - NIGHT

Its quiet up here too the rexes nowhere to be seen At the
cliff a hand appears from over the edge Then another
SARAH pulls herself up back onto solid ground then comes
NICK then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
the edge

They collapse there in the mud completely exhausted
MALCOLM

(softly)
Eddie
He looks at the other two They glance around then drop
their heads Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance

SARAH
Oh God Now what

From the edge of the jungle a cris-cross of flashlight beams
moves toward them But rather than the three or four that
would signify their own group there are nearly twenty of
them

The HUNTERS PETER LUDLOW is in the lead ROLAND and AJAY
with him DIETER is there too shepherding KELLY and DR
JUTTSON along in front of him

Malcolm sees Kelly they call out to each other and race
together Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
as he possibly can

MALCOLM
Are you all right Anything broken

KELLY
Im fine Im fine I was scared I
thought you are you okay

MALCOLM
Im fine Im fine

Roland looks around at the mess that was their base camp

ROLAND
(mostly to himself)
Thats what you think

CUT TO
EXT RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT

In the ruins of the first teams base camp the survivors of
the nights two separate catastrophes stand face to face ina
heated argument

MALCOLM sits off to the side still holding Kelly in his arms
just looking down at the ground and shaking his head Theres
something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
than any of the hot tempers that are flaring LUDLOW rants to
SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK

LUDLOW
Trespassing sabotage -- you could go
to jail just for being here did
you know that

SARAH
Dont start a legal argument with me
this island isnt your property and
neither are these animals

DR JUTTSON has encountered DR BURKE
JUTTSON

What are you doing here Burke
Theres no TV cameras whats the

point

BURKE
Dr Juttson you exist outside the
classroom I am amazed

Dieter continues to get in Nicks face

NICK
Are you looking for a problem

JUTTSON
(an urgent whisper)
Everyone keep your voices down

ROLAND
Back off Dieter

JUTTSON
Listen to me by moving the baby
rex into our camp we changed the
adults perceived territory

LUDLOW
Their what

SARAH
(she understands
Oh God

JUTTSON
Thats why they persisted in
destroying the trailers they now
feel they have to defend this entire
area Were not safe here

LUDLOW
(of Sarah and Nick)
Thanks to you people

SARAH
Hey we came here to observe you
came here to strip-mine the place
Its a looter mentality all you care
about is what you can take

ROLAND
None of that matters Our
communications equipments been
destroyed If your radio and
satellite phone were in those
trailers that went off the cliff and
Im guessing by the look on his

face --

He points at Malcolm who is still off to the side sitting in
stunned silence Malcolm looks up and nods slowly The
grimness of their situation sinks in

ROLAND (contd)
We are stuck here ladies and
gentlemen And were stuck together

CUT TO
EXT HUNTERS CAMP - NIGHT

Back in the hunters now-demolished camp members of the two
groups combine their diminished supplies They have half a
dozen large plastic containers of water thirty-seven
containers of food ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins
a variety of weapons mot of them borne on the hips or
shoulders of the HUNTER team the charred and scraggly
remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
equipment a flare gun and several flares somebodys tattered
paperback (Crime and Punishment) a box of Hershey bars and
a cartoon of Marlboros

ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources which are
displayed in front of him LUDLOW NICK SARAH JUTTSON and
MALCOLM who is still holding KELLY close to him are with
him They hold their discussion in quiet tones

ROLAND
If we cant stay in the rexs
territory we have to move tonight

SARAH
Move where Our boats not coming
for two days your airlift is waiting
for an order you have no way to
send --

Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
photographs of the island which are still mostly legible

LUDLOW
Theres a communication center here
in the old worker village Hammond
put in some kind of renewable power
source replenishing It may still
work If we could get there we
could send a radio call for the
airlift

NICK
How far is the village

LUDLOW
I said if we could get there

NICK
Well how far is it

LUDLOW
A days walk maybe more Thats not
the problem

ROLAND
What is

LUDLOW
The velociraptors

Malcolm looks up sharply

LUDLOW (contd)
Our infrareds show their nesting
sites are concentrated in the island
interior Thats why we planned on
keeping to the outer rim

Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
something to her quietly in the background

DIETER
What are velociraptors

JUTTSON
Carnivores Pack hunters About six
feet long three or four hundred
pounds and very very fast

Dieter brandishes his weapon

DIETER
I think we can handle ourselves
against them

Malcolm rejoins the conversation alone He keeps his voice
low

MALCOLM
No Im quite certain you cant

ROLAND
Look we have two choices We can
hike back down to the lagoon where
we can sit for two days in the open
next to a heavily used water source
while were waiting for your boat to
arrive or we can head for the
village where we might find some
shelter and we can call for help

MALCOLM

Wed never make it past the raptors
Trust me I have some experience in
this matter

Roland looks at him
ROLAND

That may be But you werent with
me at the time

Malcolm just shakes his head then turns and walks back to
Kelly Roland turns to the others

ROLAND (contd)
Load up Lets get this moveable
feast underway

CUT TO
EXT ISLAND - NIGHT

The SURVIVORS set forth marching through the jungle ina
column Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
servo-flashlights Wires run from the lights end in

sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks Thus
attached when the hunters turn their heads the servo-lights
turn with them illuminating whatever direction they look in

MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
it over his shoulder as he marches limping heavily He looks
down at KELLY who is marching alongside him His face shows
the deepest of regret He shakes his head cursing himself

MALCOLM
Damn it

He looks away as Kelly looks up at him questioning ROLAND
falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp

ROLAND
You all right

Malcolm looks at him then looks away without answering

ROLAND (contd)
Wrong question

MALCOLM
You ever heard of Gamblers Ruin

ROLAND
Whats that

MALCOLM
A statistical phenomenon Says
everything in the world goes in
streaks Its real you see it
everywhere -- in weather in river
flooding in baseball in blackjack
in stock markets Once things go
bad they tend to stay bad Bad
things cluster They go to hell
together

ROLAND
Feeling a bit blue are we

Malcolm glances at Kelly who has taken a slightly faster pace
and is a few steps ahead of them now

MALCOLM
Just -- flawed Very deeply flawed

ROLAND
Why did you come here

MALCOLM
So that others would know about this
place

ROLAND

Why should they

MALCOLM
Because it exists

ROLAND
Itll still exit if they go on not
knowing wont it

MALCOLM
Yes And people will live in the
absence of truth

ROLAND
So the truth is more important to you
than your life

MALCOLM
(lowers is voice)
I dont care about my life But if
Id ever thought for a second that
she would be in danger --

Roland follows his gaze forward to Kelly whos about ten
yards ahead now

ROLAND
She yours

AHEAD OF THEM
Kelly can hear their voices faint but clear They are not
as far away as they think they are

MALCOLM (os)
Im afraid so I dont know what the
hell Im doing with kids I never
should have had her

Kellys face shows she heard that part
BEHIND HER
Malcolm unaware continues with Roland

MALCOLM (contd)
Why are you here

ROLAND
Somewhere on this island there
exits the greatest predator that
ever lived And the second greatest
predator must take him down

MALCOLM
But why

ROLAND
You remember that guy about twenty
years ago I forget his name but he
climbed Everest without any oxygen
came down almost dead And they
asked him why did you go up there
to die And he said I didnt I
went up there to live

MALCOLM

(nods)
Its called self-testing But in
your case it sounds more like
self-destruction A uniquely human
characteristic In fact human
beings destroy things so well that I
sometimes think thats our function
Maybe every few sons some animal
comes along that kills off the rest
of the world clears the decks and
lets evolution proceed to his next
phase Maybe death and destruction
are our job maybe were supposed
to destroy ourselves and every other
living thing that-

Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
staring at Malcolm shaken by his words Roland grabs Malcolm
by the shirt collar and pulls him close GROWLING in his ear
ROLAND
Tell you what You can see whatever
you want to to me but you will not
spew any more nihilist rants at
anyone else in the group Im
fighting panic and you push the
wrong buttons Understand

Malcolm just blinks This guys in charge

CUT TO

EXT JUNGLE - DAWN

As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky the SURVIVORS
stagger on exhausted Some are starting to tire and there
are spaces in the column MALCOLMs limp seems to be getting
worse NICK reaches out to take Malcolms pack but Malcolm
swats his hand away

KELLY still ahead of him falls into step with SARAH

KELLY
I dont think -- my dad doesnt
think were going to make it

Sarah looks at her

SARAH
Your dad is wrong About a lot more
than he knows

She puts an arm around her Kelly looks up at her grateful
The long march continues

UP AT THE FRONT
NICK catches up to ROLAND

NICK
I think you should call a break

ROLAND
Another half hour

NICK
Some of them wont make another half
hour We didnt come this far to
start dropping in the middle of the
jungle If you dont call it I
will

Roland looks at him steely then SHOUTS to the group

ROLAND
FIVE MINUTES BREAK
Immediately the marchers drop where they stood absolutely
drained

AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP

DRS BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering

JUTTSON
I cant believe youre still angry
about that

BURKE

You know its very easy to criticize
the first person who studies
something

JUTTSON
No its easy to criticize sloppy
research and hasty conclusions

NEARBY

MALCOLM checks Nicks bag of videotapes making sure theyre
still dry and undamaged Sarah comes up watching him

SARAH
You know even if we do get those
tapes back people are going to say
its just another hoax Ian
Malcolms alien autopsy

MALCOLM
Maybe Maybe not

SARAH
Ian they will misplace our evidence
shoot holes in our testimony and say
some special effects genius created
the animals The only way people
will ever believe that dinosaurs
exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
middle of times Square

He doesnt look at her She sits down beside her
SARAH (contd)
Theres something more important that
you should be thinking about instead
BEHIND THEM
Dr Burke furious has stalked away from Juttson and sits
down on a rock H does a double take noticing something

behind the rock He leans over and picks it up

Its an oval shape about eight inches long with a pebbled
exterior A dinosaur egg
Burkes face lights up fascinated and he carefully pieces
the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder

AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP

DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack drops
the pack on the ground and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
CARTER his driver who has his back turned

DIETER
Wait here for me would ya Carter

He steps off the path into the jungle But as we come around
the front of Carter we see hes wearing a Walkman the
headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears

And he didnt hear a word
EXT THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY

Only a few feet off the path its primary forest the growth
so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured DIETER claws
forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself

He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
hand to his belt buckle He freezes hearing something we
didnt He glances around head darting alert to any danger

Nothing there Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--
-- and s SCURRYING around to his left

Dieter snaps his head in that direction At first he sees
nothing but as he moves closer gun extended in front of him
he sees a small dinosaur a COMPSOGRATHUS the same
chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago

DIETER
Its not polite to --

He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
it to the compys back The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
and dances over the compys body and it convulses in pain

DIETER (contd)
-- sneak up on people

The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle
whimpering Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
paces pushes aside two large palm fronds and steps out

into --

-- more jungle He stops puzzled not sure if he went back
or forward

He looks behind him He pauses recalculating the path he
took coming into the jungle MUTTERING to himself gesturing
with his hands retracing his steps

He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
that direction But after five or six hard-fought steps he
stops again Still nothing but jungle

DIETER
HEY CARTER YELL OR SOMETHING I
GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE

ON THE TRAIL

Dieters cries are faint but audible The only Marchers hear
enough to hear him is CARTER but the Walkman is blaring in
his ears

DIETER (0s)
--Carter me

IN THE JUNGLE

Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again this time from his
right He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
foliage moving faster and faster

Panicking he ties to run but the roots rise high out of the
ground in the jungle and he trips on one and falls flat on
his face

He looks up The SCURRYING sound comes again this time ten
times louder than before like a hundred feet coming at him

Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him

He whirls to his right Whatever it is rushes in from that
side as well And the left And behind him Dieter
scrambles up into a sitting position --

-- and laughs He is surrounded by at least forty compys now
the same as the one he wounded

For a long moment they just stare at him Slowly he brings
his gun around to point it at them

DIETER
Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

As one the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward
covering Dieters body Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
each try to grab a scrap of his flesh tearing savagely

Dieter SCREAMS and flails waving his arms and legs wildly
Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off
SMASHING into trees or the ground But dozens of others hang
on and Dieter falls over backwards now lying on his back on
the ground
Hysterical he fights like hell to get to his feet SCREAMING
shaking swatting the compys loose He spins and that tactic
seems to work as the compys themselves begin to panic and
drop off of him But he also loses his grip on his weapon
which goes flying landing in the thick foliage five or six
feet from him

Losing the attack the compys turn and dart away en masse
stopping ten yards away from him

But they turn and regroup facing him in a line hopping up
and down CHIRPING and SHRIEKING

Dieter bounds into the foliage looking for his gun But the
compys follow him in and hes forced to flee abandoning his

lost weapon

Ten feet on he stops knowing hes screwed without the gun
He turns to face the pursuing compys

They stop

Dieter charges them SHOUTING waving his arms

The compys turn and run Dieter stops

The compys stop They stare back at him There is a moment
of quiet then they start to hop again CHIRPING and
SQUEALING

Dieter tired of this game turns and runs away

The compys follow

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

From the front of the convoy ROLAND SHOUTS out

ROLAND
Breaks over move on

The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
start to march again At the rear of the group someone taps
Carter who is still listening to his music Carter gets up
hoists his backpack and marches away

Behind him Dieters pack is left forgotten on the jungle
trail

EXT DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY
DIETER stumbles along exhausted He reaches the edge of a
stream that runs under the foliage and his feet slip on the

stones He falls into the rocky stream

Behind him the army of compys pours over the little hill he
just crested They disappear for a moment down an incline --

-- And then swarm over his body In a frenzy of splashing
Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away through the stream
He gets to his feet but falls again this time over a log A
geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
Dieter drops out of sight

The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too
throwing up their own splashes of water SCREECHING
CHIRPING and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieters
SCREAMS

Now aS more compys leap over the log and splash into the
water below the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
are pink
And then theyre a deep deep red

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - DAY
The group has stopped again Near the rear SARAH NICK
MALCOLM LUDLOW and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with

CARTER

ROLAND
How long ago was this

CARTER
Seven eight minutes

Roland looks at them thinking Finally
ROLAND
Then hes dead Nobody tells the
little girl Last thing we need is

screaming hysterics

He turns and heads back to the front of the column

SARAH
We have to send someone to look for
him

ROLAND

You go if you like but were not
waiting for you MOVE IT OUT

They look at each other appalled but the column starts to
move Numbed shocked but left with no choice they move on
one by one

CUT TO

EXT ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK
The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge
where they are silhouetted against the setting sun Theyre
taking a break sprawled out on rocks or over the ground

MALCOLM sits next to KELLY whos sitting on a log

MALCOLM
You okay

She doesnt look at him just gets up and walks away going to
sit over next to SARAH

Malcolm watches pained but Sarah puts an arm around her and
makes a shes okay gesture to Malcolm

AT THE RIDGE

ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
interior From his vantage point hes able to see all the
way to the far side of the island a rim of herd black cliff
miles away Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
gently undulating jungle

He refers to one of the satellite recon photos

ROLAND
Looks like the worker village is down
in there about a mile and a half
northeast from the base of these
cliffs

MALCOLM is next to him
MALCOLM
There must be a game trail some kind
of path that goes down there
Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS
ROLAND
Theyll have to rest before we look
for it Eat Sleep Two hours
Then we hit it
CUT TO
EXT CAMPSITE - NIGHT
The group has made camp in the jungle The mood is somber
most of the MARCHERS asleep already Three or four tents have
been put up
IN ONE TENT

KELLY sits quietly in a corner her eyes wide knees hugged up
to his chest SARAH comes in
SARAH
There you are Your dads looking
for you

KELLY
I doubt that

Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
the broad red smear across its front

SARAH
Oh come on Go talk to him

KELLY
Why He likes to be alone I can
stay with you

IN THE CAMPSITE

all is still The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
the sleeping marchers

In his tent ROLAND abruptly sits up As if he heard
something He looks out the open flap In the middle of the
campsite he sees AJAY stop in his tracks head cocked

Roland gets up and goes outside joining Ajay in the middle of
the camp

ROLAND
You hear something

AJAY
No I feel something

Roland looks at him This isnt so good He looks out at the
shifting jungle He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up

over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp

ROLAND
Oh no

IN SARAHS TENT

Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags trying
to get a few minutes rest Sarahs shirt hangs over them
swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap

As the shirt dangles there swinging softly from side to side
we notice the broad red smear across the front Oh thats
right -- its blood

The baby T-rexs blood

AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP
the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
thats been lit by DR BURKE

Hes set a small frying pan on top of it and now he CRACKS
the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan

Roland and Ajay run up behind him
ROLAND
(hisses)

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND
Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire
BMBB
Roland Ajay and Burke all freeze What was that
IN SARAHS TENT
Sarah and Kelly sit up They felt it too
BMBB

AT THE COCKING FIRE

ROLAND
Get my weapon

Ajay turns and trots away a few steps then stops cold
staring down at the ground

BMBB

A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp and
impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
circles spreading to the outer edges

BMBB
IN SARAHS TENT

Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
into Ziploc bags

BMBB

Now they leap into Sarahs sleeping bag to seal themselves
and draw the zipper up all the way around

Outside the silhouette of the rexs head passes by the tent
Sarah works faster her fingers struggling to close the last
few inches but --

-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent It
sniffs SNORTING the air in and out It looks around the
tent
It sniffs Sarahs hanging shirt the one that is stained with
the blood of the baby tyrannosaur The adult tyrannosaur
GURGLES again COOING and cocking its head curiously

In the sleeping bag Sarah and Kellys eyes are barely
visible wide in panic The rex sniffs and nudges the bag
trying to figure out what this thing is

It rolls the bag over once decides its uninteresting and
then rises straights up --

-- taking the whole tent with it The stakes pop out of the
ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
away leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
beneath it

IN THE CAMPSITE

the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle joining
the first Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
up Many of them start to run

Roland scrambles toward his tent where he can see his weapon
lying near the open flap As he draws close an enormous
T-rex foot stomps down on the tent driving the rifle deep
into the mud

Roland weaponless stands frozen watching as the panicked
Hunters flee in all directions

ROLAND
FOR CHRISTS SAKE DONT RUN

But they ignore him sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
prey that pours across the campsite Some toss random and
ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes

ACROSS THE CAMPSITE

NICK bursts out of the crowd sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
to get out of the sleeping bag and grabs each by an arm He
rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him into
the jungle

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD

MALCOLM blinking back sleep stands a good head above the
rest of the panicking crowd Frantically he scans the group

MALCOLM
KELLY KEEEEELLLY

But he cant see her

AT THE EDGE OF CAMP
the two rexes join forces herding the fleeing Hunters into a
narrow ravine

UP ON A ROCK RACE
Roland scrambles up a steep rock face No way in hell hes
going down that ravine He sees Malcolm still in the middle

of the camp start to head for the ravine

ROLAND
MALCOLM OVER HERE

Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face
scrambling to climb up the smooth steep boulders

Behind him one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
camp toward him

ROLAND (contd)
FASTER

Malcolm gives it everything hes got clawing his way up the
rock face --

-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

-- and Roland reaches down grabs Malcolm by the hair and
pulls him up out of the rexs grasp

The rex falls short but hes close enough that we can hear

his teeth SNAP together closing around nothing but air It
turns sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters and takes off
after them

Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH Roland
unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap

IN THE RAVINE

Kelly in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick
hears her father screaming her name and looks up Malcolm and
Roland are on the rock ridge above them keeping pace

MALCOLM
(shouting)
KELLY UP HERE

But Kelly continues to flee as the rexes are in the ravine
now and drawing closer to the group

Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks but the
ravine is deepening theres no way out One rex grabs hold
of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face

The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
head left and right quickly to break its victims neck The
Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --
-- CARTER Dieters driver who stumbles and falls The rest
of the fleeing humans run around or over him but when the
rex lifts its foot we see Carter is actually stuck to the
bottom of it --

-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
the earth

UP ON TH ROCK FACE
Malcolm is frantic

MALCOLM
I gotta get down there

DOWN IN THE RAVINE

its obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes and Nick
knows it He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
something off to his left

Its a waterfall apparently right in front of a sheer rock
face But theres something about the way the water is
falling that tells him something

NICK
SARAH KELLY COME HERE

He grabs each of them and hauls them forward running straight
at the waterfall Apparently he intends to jump right into
the rock and hes dragging them along with him

SARAH
WHAT ARE YOU-

NICK
JUMP

The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
THROUGH the water

DR BURKE fleeing along with everyone else is watching as
they vanish

BEHIND THE WATERFALL

there is a small recess which is what Nick had hoped for
Its small only four or five feet deep but its just enough
for him Sarah and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water
Breathless terrified they can hear the mayhem outside

NICK
Shhhh shhhh

With an enormous SPLASH something bursts through the
cascading water and crashes into them
Dr Burke

BURKE
Get out of the way

He pulls his way up against the far wall as far away from the
water as he can

FOOOOM Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain
A Tyrannosaur head Burke gave away the hiding spot
The four SCREAM as the rexs jaws SNAP left and right
searching for them falling just inches short They squeeze

as far back against the wall as they can get

The rex cant quite get its head all the way through the
opening --

-- so it uses its tongue A long dark blue shape slithers
out of its mouth and touches the humans trying to wrap around
them to pull them out of the cave

Burke blind with panic forces himself even further into the
cave which pushes Kelly further out

SARAH
STOP IT YOURE PUSHED HER OUT STOP
IT

But Burke doesnt listen throwing elbows to make room for
himself His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth and
a flurry of enormous cockroaches eight or nine inches long
each pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck

Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away toward the flowing
water

And thats all the leverage the rex needs It curls its
tongue wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
teeth SCREAMING hideously he is dragged out through the
waterfall and disappears

Sarah Nick and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
water turn pink

UP ON THE ROCK FACE

Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
with Burke leaving the hiding place unmolested Malcolm is
nearly hysterical

ROLAND
Shes okay Theyll stay in there
shes okay
IN A JUNGLE CLEARING

routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
jungle Ahead of them there is a large open plain covered by
long elephant grass

AJAY running along with them stops abruptly at the edge of
the grass SHOUTING to the others

AWAY
NO DONT GO INTO THE LONG GRASS

Not in the frenzy they ignore him Behind Ajay the enormous
shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well holding
up at the edge of the jungle

Ajay torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
judgement opts for the former and races into the grass after
the other Hunters waving his arms

UP ABOVE THEM

Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
of the plain below Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
as they plow through the grass

ROLAND
Elephant grass

ON THE PLAIN

the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass
One of them stops and turns looking back at the jungle trees

HUNTER
They gave up Theyre not chasing
us

There are CHEERS SIGHS OF relief In the distance AJAYS
VOICE can be heard faintly calling to them to come back Up
on the rock in the distance they can see Roland waving his
arms madly

But in the giddiness of their escape they pay it no mind
They continue plowing into the high grass anything to get
further away from the tyrannosaurs

ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY

the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly backlit by
the full moon In the distance the heads can seethe Hunter

party The heads descend back into the grass

BACK WITH THE HUNTERS

they continue forward oblivious Now behind them four
more heads rise up in the grass As then descend
On all sides of the Hunters the grass ripples as animals move
forward toward them undetected inexorable as torpedoes

And these torpedoes are on target One Hunter is suddenly
dragged down yanked silently below the surface of the tall
grass

In his place a long lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
drops its head to make the kill

Behind him two more Hunters are taken down and two more
animal tails rise up in their place A Hunter ahead hears the
RUSTLING and turns His face turns white as behind him --

-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass

Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs
the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
claw carried in a retracted position with which it slashes
on attack

Like now This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
Hunter taking him down A feeding frenzy ensues The
Hunters run in all directions but are pulled down and vanish
into the twitching long grass
Another raptor enters from the right leaps high into the air
past the full moon SLAMS into the chest of more human prey
and takes him down into the grass
Behind them Ajays face falls defeated He looks around
realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
grass
Around him four torpedo trails head straight for him
Ajay simply closes his eyes
UP ON THE ROCK
Roland turns away from the carnage pained

CUT TO
EXT RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT
SARAH MALCOLM KELLY NICK ROLAND DR JUTTSON and PETER
LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite their ranks
decimated spirits shattered
Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was
He has pulled his 800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or

less cleaned it now hes checking the loads

Kelly nearly catatonic with fear clings to Sarah and it
doesnt look as if shell ever let go Malcolm who is on his
knees picking through the wreckage of a tent looks over at
them but Sarah waves him off -- shes okay

Roland appears

standing over the group He looks at Malcolm

who has found the Lindstradt rifle intact

ROLAND
How many rounds did you find for that
weapon

MALCOLM
Four counting the one in the

chamber

ROLAND

Dont let it out of your hands again
(to Sara but looking at
Kelly)

Can the kid walk

Ask her

SARAH

ROLAND

Can the kid walk

I can I can

KELLY
walk

While he addresses the group Roland straps on one of the
the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow

servo-lights
your gaze

ROLAND

Were going to find a path down into
the interior of the island Load up
whatever you think you need and I
mean need If you cant carry it
indefinitely dont bring it Well
hit the worker village in a couple
hours and be out of here before dawn

AT THE EDGE OF CAMP

Roland bends
rex Behind
slinging the

Roland bends

a liquid of some kind

He takes his

over one
him the
remnants

over and

canteen

of the three-toed footprints left by the
rest of the group is packing up
of their equipment over their shoulders

SNIFFS the footprint Its filled with

dumps the remaining water into the

ground and plunges the canteen into the footprint filling
it Ludlow hovers over his shoulder

What

is that

LUDLOW
ROLAND
Piss

Ludlow doesnt ask
NOW AT THE FIRE

Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
to such disaster He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
in his pants pocket

CUT TO
EXT VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT

ROLAND and LUDLOW (who along with Sarah and Malcolm is also
wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
come out in a flattened area Ludlow GASPS looking ahead in
wonderment MALCOLM breaks through the hillsides foliage a
moment later He too stares in amazement

SARAH and KELLY come next then NICK then JUTTSON One by
one they all stop and stare

SARAH
God help us

Theyre standing in a flat sandy area lined with boulders at
the sides The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
side and as far as they can see ahead But thats not what
amazes them so

Everywhere the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons Some
are huge apatosaurs sixty feet from head to tail tip
Others are smaller herbivores of many different kinds The
more intact skeletons lie on their sides their ribcages arcs
of pale bone but just as many have been ripped apart bits
of carcass tossed in every direction

NICK
I do not feel lucky

ROLAND
Keep moving
They march on tiny figures moving among the mountainous
skeletons by the light of the full moon Roland notices one
carcass in particular a recent kill Its an enormous

HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it

He bends down studying the soft earth around it for
footprints

FURTHER ON

Malcolm looks up noticing the bony shapes around them which
fall in heavy shadows like cell bars seem to be changing

He turns and his servo-light shines on the bones But
theyre not bones any more at all theyre pipes the animal
graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
objects -- twisted rotting machinery

LUDLOW
We made it

They hurry over a small rise --
EXT WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT

-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
Sornas worker village The size of a football field the
town is divided by a main street thats dotted on both sides
by stores residences cafes a gas station All the way at
the far end is a large blocky four-story building

But the town is a mess The hurricane that hit here must have
been ferocious for everywhere things are smashed broken
upended And the jungle has stepped into the breath growing
up around and over everything Huge root systems snake
through the street making it almost impassable

MALCOLM
The jungle Its always ready to
return

Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow

ROLAND
Wheres the power and radio setup

LUDLOW
Operations building Far end of the
street

A light rain falls as they start down the street carefully
silently Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready

They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower An empty gas
station its vine-snarled pumps now useless The only sound
is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
the groups gazes obediently

Every few feet the group encounters strange grayish lumps
that lies in random places in the middle of the street

Malcolm curious stops and taps one of them Its a rock-hard
Nick looks over his shoulder

NICK
Lava

MALCOLM
No
NICK
What are they

MALCOLM
I dont know

Finally they reach the operation building at the far end of
the town

LUDLOW
The radio rig is inside It runs
directly from the geothermal
generator so power shouldnt be a
problem

ROLAND
Good

He pulls out his canteen Ludlow watches as he screws the top
off moves toward the building and starts splashing the
contents on the outside of it

The rest of the group just stares at him

MALCOLM
Whats he got in there

LUDLOW
Piss

SARAH
What

LUDLOW

Dont ask me The guys completely
out to lunch

NICK
What in Gods name would he want
with-
Roland rejoins them
ROLAND
Tyrannosaur urine I dont want

anything to do with it and neither
does any other animal on this island
This building is now demarcated as
the rexs territory As long as you
stay in that building youll all be
safe until the helicopter comes

He drops his pack swings his gun off his shoulder and checks
the load Dr Juttson looks fearful

JUTTSON
Where are you going

ROLAND
After the rex I saw a fresh kill
back in the valley with tyrannosaur
tracks all around it If Im not
back in time dont wait for me

SARAH
Youve got to be kidding

ROLAND
Runs against my nature to hole up in
a cave and wait

LUDLOW
Do you think the rex might have the

infant with it

ROLAND
Possible

Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick

LUDLOW
You know how to work a radio dont
you

SARAH

Youre going too

LUDLOW
I lost everything I came after on
this trip but one T-rex in one theme
park could single-handedly bail
InGen out of Chapter 11

He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
to Nick

LUDLOW (contd)
This is the broadcast frequency ID
yourself as Harvest Leader You
know what to tell ‘em

MALCOLM
You gentlemen feel you have to do
this now

ROLAND
Nows the perfect time The animal
just fed so it wont stalk us for
food Predators dont hurt when
theyre not hungry

Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --
NICK
No

-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun

NICK (contd)
Only humans do

CUT TO
INT COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly
all green red and yellow NICK tunes the dial to a specific
frequency The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in

NICK
(into microphone)
CQ CQ This is InGen Operation
Harvest Leader to Harvest Base Come
in please

The remaining SURVIVORS minus Ludlow and Roland shine their
flashlights around the dusty vine-hung interior of the
communications room On the wall a row of chrome letters says
We Make The Future but the words are obscured by a tangle
of vines Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet

On one wall there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
Park would have looked like Big hotels Ford Explorers with
tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures big crowds
at the fences around the animal exhibits But none of it came
true and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered

There is a pause filed only with radio static Sarah looks
at Nick tensely waiting Finally a VOICE comes over the
radio clean as can be

VOICE (os)
Go ahead Harvest Leader

They all breath a sign of relief

CUT TO
EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT
With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
group inside the operations building main street stands

deserted and silent

Nearly deserted anyway Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
end of the street --

-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN

CUT TO
EXT VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT

ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death standing

amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals Roland bends
down checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
saw earlier

A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
carcass down the stream bed Roland follows them Ludlow
follows Roland

As they near a bend in the stream Roland looks down at the
surface of the water A pattern of ripples moves toward them
washing over their ankles Roland follows the ripples with
his eyes From up head around the bend he can hear the
sound of an animal eating and drinking A very large animal

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pinch of the ashes
from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
that on the wind They float there for a second suspended
then blow back at him

LUDLOW
Were downwind Good

Roland darts a contemptuous look at him He puts a finger to
his lips gesturing for silence then steps up onto the
shore Ludlow follows

They creep forward toward the sounds They round the bend
and Roland hits his belly edging up over a small rise

ver the rise he sees the TYRANNOSAUR about a hundred yards
ead Its stooped over the stream bed drinking Like a
ird it dips its head in the water and then straightens up
o let the water fall down its throat A dozen COMPYS are at
e water as well drinking

ttrowo

Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to off

Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch As he
puts his weight on one knee it presses down hard on the
middle of a small stick which CRACKS in half Roland turns
eyes blazing

Out in the open the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
well staring in the direction of the sound But since
Rolands own head is turned he doesnt see the dinosaurs
reaction Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow
Roland turns his head back The tyrannosaur is gone

FURTHER ON

the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly
Roland stops too gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him

Roland glances both ways looking for any sign of the track

To the right the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock
A short distance behind them the rock is solid a massive
green pebbled boulder ten feet high Roland frowns and
WHISPERS in Ludlows ear again

ROLAND
We took to the rock

LUDLOW
Why

In front of Roland a palm frond sways gently in the night
breeze Rolands eyes widen He pulls out another pinch of
campfire ash and releases it on the wind

This time the ash blows off straight away from him

ROLAND
Wind shift

They freeze terrified Behind them the enormous green
pebbled boulder --

-- opens an eye

Thats no boulder thats the MALE TYRANNOSAUR standing
rock-solid still its natural camouflage blending into the
surrounding foliage perfectly Very slowly and almost
silently the rex brings its head all the way around until it
is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away

Roland and Ludlow stand frozen their back to the rex
unaware of its presence

Until it exhales The soft SNORT of its breath isnt quite
audible but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
ever so slightly

Their hearts drop into their stomachs Ludlow speaks his
voice a queasy HISS

LUDLOW
Its behind us

ROLAND
(the very softest whisper)
Its just fed It wont attack unless
its threatened Dont move

As the rex silently cocks its head sizing up the danger from
these intruders it breathes again A few strands of Ludlows
hair flap in the exhalation He closes his eyes near tears

He cant take it His eyes dart glancing down at the weapon
he holds in his hands Unfortunately its extended in front
of him away from the rex
He risks another HISS

LUDLOW
If I dont move I cant shoot it

ROLAND
Let it go Peter The animal won

Behind them the rex appears satisfied It starts to swing
its massive head around back toward the jungle It lifts one
great leg and takes a step into the trees

Roland signs and closes his eyes relieved

But Ludlow seizes the opportunity He whips his weapon around
and drops to one knee

ROLAND (contd)
No

The rex is infinitely quicker Ludlow just has time to
squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
animal whirls takes one elegant step forward and POUNCES

Ludlows bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
the rexs legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down
jaws wide They close around Ludlows body lift his straight
up into the air and toss him once readjusting their grip so
it is firmly around his midsection

The whole combination of movements takes but half a second
By the time Roland turns around the animal has pivoted and
darted back into the jungle carrying Ludlow still SCREAMING
and writhing in its mouth

Roland raises his gun to draw a bead on the animal but
through the shivering trees he can only see that the
tyrannosaur is gone

CUT TO
INT COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

MALCOLM SARAH NICK KELLY and DR JUTTSON wait nervously in
the communications room An empty can of Dr Pepper sitting
on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE They look over at
it confused as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
formica counter

Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too Glass jars
CLANK against one another books start to drop off the
shelves a stool shudders across the floor

KELLY
Whats going on
Above them the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
actually tear away chunks of moldy timber flying up into
the night They look up a deafening ROAR fills the room --

-- and a helicopters searchlight floods in

As the chopper dips lower looking for a place to land the
violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
heads

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Up above the operations building the helicopter circles The
roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber
impossible to land open

Below the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
the building They wave frantically their flashlight beams
piercing the night sky

PILOT
There they are

The Co-Pilot scans the street below but its choked with
overturned cars and fallen trees

CO-PILOT
No LZ in the street too much debris

PILOT
Check the other buildings

The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off swooping over the rest of
the village

At the far end of the street the Co-Pilot brings the
searchlight to bear on the large flat roof of a three story
building

The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up
EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT

MALCOLM SARAH KELLY NICK and finally DR JUTTSON run out
the front of the operations building At the end of the
street they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
the building to land on its roof

MALCOLM
There it is

Happily the group double-times it down the street headed for
the chopper Again those strange rock formations are
everywhere Some seem to be on the sides of buildings as if
they once dripped there and then turned to stone
This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
of a car like solidified lava Her face falls as a thought
occurs to her

SARAH
Ian Its guano

MALCOLM
What

SARAH
These formations Theyre dried --

MALCOLM
Birdshit

A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them
They dont see it

NICK
Who cares Lets go

Unaware of the raptors presence they resume their trot
toward the helicopter Behind them the raptor crouches and
SNARLS but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
helicopters engines It springs covering the distance
between them quickly

The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON the last person in the group
and takes him down Juttson is thrown forward into the
others who fall like dominoes

Juttson SCREAMS his voice an unnatural high-pitched SQUEAL
as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him

Sarah looks up panicked Her eyes widen at the sight of a
SECOND RAPTOR this one running straight at hr at top speed
She buries her face in the dirt covering her head with her
hands --

-- and the raptors foot SLAMS into the ground between her
legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson joining the
first raptor in the kill

Panicked the group scatters in all directions Kelly jumps
up and scrambles into the middle of the street where she hits
the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
road

Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was but shes
gone now He looks around frantically

MALCOLM
Kelly KELLY

Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
nearest her

Behind her a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase bounding after her
with horrifying speed Sarah runs flat-out but her speed is
nothing compared to the raptors and it gains on her rapidly

The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah
and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
her we realize shes crawled into the back seat of an
abandoned car

But the car door is thin protection against the charging
raptor which SLAMS into the window head first The window
spinderwebs but does not yield The raptor crumples to the
ground

Sarah looks up through a three inch hole in the middle of the
web The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
into the tiny hole thrashing widening it

Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
the hole SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face

She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
animal penetrates even further into the car but its torso
will not fit through the window opening It pulls away

In the front seat Sarah gets some very bad news
Theres no windshield

The raptor springs up onto the hood its claws CLATTERING on
the sheet metal and tosses its body through the opening --

-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door While the raptor
struggles to right itself in the front seat Sarah runs to the
nearest building ducks inside and SLAMS the heavy wooden
door

CUT TO
EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT

MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
station building closing the door behind him A moment
later a raptor bounds after him SLAMMING into the door

Meeting resistance it bounces off notices the plate glass
window next to the door and pounces at that The window
SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge staring inside
its tail hanging out

Just as it gets inside Malcolm opens the door and comes back
out keeping the place of wall between them He pulls the

Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

-- but the raptor whirls and springs forcing him back inside
through the door again

Willing to play along the raptor turns and jumps through the
window again

INT GAS STATION - NIGHT

Balancing on the window frame the raptor HISSES and crouches
ready to spring at Malcolm

Malcolm takes cover behind the door which is hanging open
between them He raises the rifle

Th raptor springs into the door BLASTING it off its hinges
knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him

But the door SMACKS up against the wall covering the window
preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way

For the moment

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT

Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground

He GROANS in agony and rolls off his bad leg which is twisted
unnaturally beneath him and claws in the mud for the gun
ROUGH HANDS reach down grab him by the shirt and haul him to
his feet Its NICK He drags Malcolm away but in the
commotion Nicks duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in

the street spilling some of the precious videotapes

Malcolm scoops them up

NICK
Come on

MALCOLM
Wheres Kelly

NICK

Shes with Sarah

They race off down the street
CUT TO

INT KILN HOUSE - NIGHT
High above SARAH we see she is standing alone in a three
story kiln house a windowless shed used for firing pottery
and other construction projects Catwalks lined with heavy
chains hang above her and onto the floor below she turns in

circles wondering what to do now

From outside the kiln house she hears SCRATCHING digging
sounds From the other side of the door comes an animal
SNORT and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
the crack along the ground

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously trying to
tunnel underneath

INSIDE

Sarah runs to the opposite wall falls to her knees and
starts digging a tunnel of her own clawing frantically at the
ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
it

Sarah digs faster So does the raptor
With about eight inches of space under the wall Sarah grabs

hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
hard as she can It snaps off with a loud CRACK

At the door the raptor stops digging Its silent for a
moment

Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now
She starts to lower her body into it --

-- JUST AS THE RAPTORS CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER
SIDE

Sarah falls back SCREAMING leaps to her feet and jumps up
grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above She starts to
climb up anywhere up as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
its way inside coming in through her hole

Sarah climbs hauling herself up leaping from one catwalk to
another

The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her
EXT KILM HOUSE - NIGHT

A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside

CUT TO
EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street They
can see helicopter at the far end engine ROARING and
searchlight playing over them as they draw closer They
approach a rusted abandoned pickup in the middle of the
street --

-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it Its claws CLACK on the
roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch
They dont stick around to negotiate Nick hauls Malcolm off
into the nearest building

INT WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT

NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them
Theyre standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind
probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
spend the night The room and staircase wind around a large
open-aired central area four stories tall They SHOUT at each
other frantic

MALCOLM
We cant stay in here

NICK
Were sure as hell not going back out
there

MALCOLM

This is single-wall construction
Its just a shack

NICK
Itll hold

MALCOLM
For sixty seconds maybe Look at
this

(RAPS on the door with his
knuckles)
You could-
With a CRASH the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
swings open violently Malcolm is thrown aside landing hard
on the floor

A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway Nick throws his
weight against the door SLAMMING it hard against the raptor

Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back

SLAM The raptor charges the door again this time BLASTING
it off its hinges knocking Nick to the floor beneath it The
raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm

Malcolm swings the gun around --

-- the raptor lunges at him --

-- Malcolms finger closes on the trigger --

-- and the raptor lands on top of him

The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor but the
gun barrel now stands between them The raptor CHOMPS down
hard on the barrel its teeth GRINDING on the metal and SNAPS
its head to tear it from Malcolms hands

Malcolm pulls the trigger

The raptors eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
its throat It makes a GURGLING sound then convulses
violently and rolls off of Malcolm yanking the gun from his
hands as it falls and dies

Nick scrambles out from under the door Malcolm tries to
wrench the gun from the raptors clenched jaws but it wont
budge
NICK
(helping him out)
Head for the roof

MALCOLM
I have to find Kelly

NICK
I think shes with Sarah

MALCOLM
DAMN IT BE SURE

CUT TO
EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT
KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed trembling with
fear She holds her breath and freezes as just outside only

two feet from where shes hiding --

-- a RAPTORS FEET pick their way past her down the middle of
the street

Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream
CUT TO
EXT ROOFTOP - NIGHT
NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
hotel and SLAM the door behind them The helicopter is now
only three rooftops away They turn and head for it Nick in

the lead but theres an eight foot gap between the buildings

MALCOLM
Its too wide

Nick looks around desperate A fallen power pole leans
against the building theyre standing on its lines gone

slack

NICK
Help me push this

Malcolm understands He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
pole and give it a mighty push tipping it over in the other
direction One good hard shove and it falls to the far
building THUDDING against it solidly

Its power lines are not taut a lifeline from this rooftop to
the next Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
the gap hand over hand

Behind them the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
open as a raptor throws all its weight into it Malcolm leaps
onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
himself across

But even with the door wide open the raptor on the other side
hesitates It SNARLS and backs away refusing to come out
onto the roof

ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP

Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop They look
back at the frightened animal which takes tow steps out onto
the roof SNARLS and backs into the doorway again

NICK
Its afraid to come onto the roof

Malcolm looks around at the rooftop Strange bits of scrap
and debris seem to have been arranged there in an odd
concentric pattern

MALCOLM
Somethings wrong

NICK
Look Sarah

He points to the roof of the kilm house in the distance
Malcolm turns and sees SARAH crawling across the tile His

face turns white

MALCOLM
SHES ALONE

CUT TO
EXT KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT
SARAH has problems Still on top of the kilm house she
reaches the edge and pushes off the roof leaping to the roof

of the next building

She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
sloping roof As she pulls herself up --
-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her In full
stride it leaps sails over her and lands on the roof
ahead of her

Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope
away from the raptor Suddenly the roof board under her
SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight The whole section
pulls up and starts to slide off the roof Sarah clinging to
it rides the roof planks down away from the raptor

She looks over her shoulder down --

-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR waiting for her on the roof of the
building below

Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof which
keeps sliding falling The raptor below jumps up just in
time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section

Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof fingers and
nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface She slides all
the way to the edge grabs hold of the gutter and dangles
there suspended above one raptor and trapped below another

The raptor above works its way down The one below leaps up
at her dangling legs She has left them in time with its
jumps to avoid losing her feet This cant go on for long

Desperate she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
and hurls it at the raptor below It hits the animal in the
head for all the good that does

But Sarah keeps on pulling and throwing more tiles She
edges to the right toward a fresh supply

The raptor above edges even closer claws CLICKING on the
slick roof

Something interesting is happening As Sarah pulls the loose
tiles free the ones above slide down to take their place
Sarah sees this and pulls more free knocking them out of the
way as fast as she can

Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates The
animals feet flail and grasp it slides towards the edge amid
the tumbling tiles

Sarah seeing it coming swings in close to the building
hugging it as closely as she can The raptor falls off the
roof right past her --

-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below Both animals SNARK and
attack one another

Now Sarah her grip exhausted falls too landing right next
to the enraged animals They fight and roll RIGHT OVER HER
She GROANS and hugs the wood below her the raptors continue
to thrash and bite they roll back toward her she rolls out
of their way --

-- and plunges through a hole in the roof

INT LAB - NIGHT

Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and

lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent

light fixture

One end of the fixtures support SNAPS it drops at a 45

degree angle Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES

through a window

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Sarah lands in the mud in the street below

CUT TO

EXT BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT

With a THUD MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other

building one of which he has just climbed off of Panicked

he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT

MALCOLM
Kelly KELLY

CUT TO
EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT

SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can toward
the building on which sits the helicopter Above her she can
see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her

Sarah reaches the fallen water tower which is next to the
helicopter building and starts to climb it

ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET

KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed In the
distance she can see the helicopter But she is trembling
with fear unable to move

The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
outside Kellys mouth drops open to scream but her terror
is so complex that no sound comes out She raises her hands
in self-defense whatevers outside ROARS with effort the
entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her and she
looks up --

-- into her fathers eyes
KELLY
Dad

MALCOLM
Come on

He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street
ON THE ROOFTOP

Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
leaps onto the roof into Nicks arms

NICK
Wheres Kelly

SARAH
Wheres Ian

Eyes wide with panic they both turn and look down at the
street below where they see KELLY and MALCOLM racing at top
speed down the middle of the street --

-- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM
DOWN IN THE STREET

Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal
Theyre pretty fast but its faster

Above them Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof
SHOUTING and urging them on They push it faster

They reach the base of the fallen water tower the jumble of
struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed

MALCOLM
CLIMB

Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles
pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
next one

Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort but for him its
much harder

Below them the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts
shaking the whole structure It pulls itself up

Higher up Kelly climbs fast hands gliding over the poles
She breaks out into the open where a long narrow pole runs
on a slight incline up to the roof She scampers across it
running the balance beam

She reaches the other side on a ledge below the roofline and
looks back Malcolm is at the other end hesitating drained
breathing hard
KELLY
DAD COME ON

Below him the raptor closes in Malcolm sets out across the
beam his legs shaking He places his feet carefully he
doesnt have nearly the balance Kelly did

The raptor draws closer

KELLY (contd)
FASTER

Malcolm slips

One foot twists right off the bar and he spins arms flailing
trying to regain his tenuous balance

But he overcompensates and his whole body wrenches out from
under him He falls the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest
knocking the wind out of him and he drops flipping right off
the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below

He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor CRUNCHING to
a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground probably
cracking a rib Kelly SCREAMS from above him

KELLY (contd)
DAD

She stares down in horror at her father Wrenched in among
the bars Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
feet above him now with an open attack route

The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch

Up above Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
and leaps out into space grabbing hold of one of the bars

The raptor springs

Kelly spins around over the top of the bar and at the very
peak of her trajectory she lets go

The raptor sails through down from above feet first SLAMMING
both of them squarely into the raptors side sending it
hurtling into space

She lands hard and awkwardly CLANGING into the spidery
scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
ground below But Kelly manages to hold on

KELLY
GET UP

She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet
ON THE ROOF

Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline The PILOTS SHOUTS
from inside

PILOT
LETS GO LETS GO LETS GO

Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter But at the
opposite side of the roof a RAPTOR claws its way over the
edge as well

Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter but the
animal is far faster Its only ten feet away then five
theyre surely done for this time when --

-- KA-BOOM

There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard
and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
the roof dead They look up to the source of the

gunshot

Its ROLAND standing at the edge of the roof holding his
smoking 600 Nitro Express

But theres no time for celebration as suddenly the
helicopters left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
roof

PILOT
HURRY THE ROOFS GIVING WAY

The skid dips even further ripping right through the
thatch-and-wood construction Kelly who had one foot in the
helicopter loses her balance --

-- as the roof caves in beneath her

MALCOLM
KELLY

She falls SCREAMING through the hole and down into the
building below

ONE FLOOR DOWN

Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
roof about nine feet down But her landing is cushioned by
an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
arranged there She lifts one hand and a yellowy viscous
substance drips off of it

Its yolk She looks around noticing half a dozen large
oblong shapes Eggs

Above her Malcolm is scrambling climbing down to her through
the wreckage of the CREAKING crumbling roof

MALCOLM
Kelly Im coming

Kelly climbs to her knees but behind her a large dark shape
is moving Rising Unfolding in a way

ITS A PTERANODON

Yep flying dinosaur The enormous animal raises its head a
brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long
saber-like beak It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury She can only
stare spellbound

Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
its massive twenty-two foot wingspread

ON THE ROOF

the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
roof and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris
Roland races over to the hole climbs in a few feet and
starts kicking at it making it larger

ROLAND
Give me a ladder

IN THE PTERANODON NEST

Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came but a
SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building
SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
middle of their clutch of eggs

An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof
Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
and they start to climb out of the nest

ON THE ROOF

Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
through the surface of the roof around them

The pteranodons are emerging

MALCOLM
GO GO GO GO GOG GO

The helicopter lurches up a few feet but it yanked to an
abrupt stop The engines WHINE the chopper just hovers
there

PILOT
Were snagged on something
They loos down BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
helicopter They flap their gigantic wings in unison and
drag the helicopter off into the air away from the nest --

-- and let go Freed the helicopter gains altitude quickly
IN THE HELICOPTER

the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along right next to
the helicopter

PILOT
Hang on If I tip it hard I can cut
em with the rotors

SARAH
NO Dont Theyre not attacking

They look out the windows where indeed the magnificent
animals are merely accompanying them flying escort as the
chopper gains altitude

SARAH (contd)
Theyre protecting their nest
Thats all Thats all theyre
doing

Kelly completely drained sits between Sarah and Malcolm
each of whom has a protective arm around her She sags
against her fathers chest nothing left

He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear
MALCOLM

Thank you Kelly thank God Thank
God for you

IN THE NIGHT SKY

over the island the helicopter steadily gains altitude A
hundred feet Three hundred A thousand

As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island the
pteranodons now peel off their job done One of them banks
sharply right in front of the moon The moonlight
silhouettes it shining right through its membranous wings
lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton

Below the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
the wine-dark sea

CUT TO
EXT TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT

Elsewhere in the forest its not such a happy story PETER
LUDLOW still alive drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
muddy ground Dizzy bleeding the breath knocked out of him
he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud

From behind him he hears a CHIRPING sound He turns
Hes in the tyrannosaur nest

The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him still with a strange
aluminum-foil cast on its leg The baby SQUEAKS with
excitement as it toddles toward him

Ludlow scrambles to his feet unsure what to do Both ADULT
TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest staring down at him

The baby runs toward Ludlow so he turns and runs away

But in an instant the male brings its head down knocking
Ludlow to the ground Then it raises its head again
Watching Waiting

Ludlow gets up again and tries to run but now the female rex
strikes knocking him over again

Ludlow tries to crawl away on all fours The male bends down
and closes its jaws around one of his legs holding it
tightly Ludlow SCREAMS --

-- and the rex bits down decisively The bone breaks with a
dry SNAP Ludlow HOWLS in pain unable to move and the baby
toddles forward eagerly Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
up onto his chest and opens its jaws wide

Peter Ludlow SCREAMS
CUT TO
EXT CEMETERY - DAY

Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky In a cemetery a group of
fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
that is festooned with cascades of flowers On a table there
is an array of framed photographs --

-- of JOHN HAMMOND A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
Mourners wipe away tears IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
distance from the group KELLY right beside him Malcolms
face is blank tired his sunburn out of place with the white
winter setting around him

At gravesite a Young Woman turns looking back over her
shoulder About sixteen shes lovely with long blonde hair
and an honest open face She notices Malcolm recognizes
him

She nudges a Young Man next to her about thirteen years old
The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming
As the ceremony breaks up they walk over to him

MALCOLM
Hello Lex Tim

LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek
TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it

MALCOLM (contd)
This is Kelly My daughter

They nod their hellos

LEX
Im glad you came Dr Malcolm

MALCOLM
Im sorry about your grandfather

TIM
Thank you

LEX
We were going to call you in a few
days Tim and I have been thinking
and weve decided we want people to
know about the island About what we
all saw

TIM
We think its something our
grandfather would want us to do

MALCOLM
(pause)
Why

LEX
Because its true

Malcolm looks at her for a long moment

MALCOLM
I know Lex But even if were the
only ones who ever know itll still
be true You see Ive decided
that if the world found out about
what your grandfather created it
wouldnt be around for very long

LEX
But -- it was real You cant let
people go on saying its not

MALCOLM
Thats the thing about reality
He looks down at Kelly

MALCOLM (contd)
Even when people stop believing in
it it doesnt go away

Kelly smiles and takes his hand her slender fingers
interlocking with his

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Back on Isla Sorna we float over the deserted worker village
moving lightly as in a dream

MALCOLM (VO)
Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
your face Thats real

We sweep low landing on the roof the helicopter took off
from the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
scrap a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it

MALCOLM (VO)
Do you see the four of us standing
here together alive Thats real

A PTERANODON land gently on the nest Ever so carefully it
positions itself over the eggs lowers itself to roosting

position and folds its giant wings around its body

MALCOLM (VO)
And maybe thats still that matters

The animal raises its head opens its beak and SQUAWKS
approvingly up at the heavens

FADE OUT
