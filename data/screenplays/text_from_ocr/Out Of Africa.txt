EXTTHE APRICAN PLAIN-DAY-CLOSE ON A RIVERINE THICKET

NO MUSIC The thicket is sundappled and still too green
for Africa The SIBILANCE of the AIR of RUNNING WATER
unseen CHITTERINGS and STIRRINGS Suddenly the FLURRY of
a chase a SHARP SCREAM small cut short A BUSH

And now the VOICE of an OLD WOMAN dry precise

HER VOICE
I had a farm in Africa at the foot
of the Ngong hills

Slowly SHOT WIDENS BEGIN MAIN TITLES

HER VOICE (contd)

The equator runs across these
highlands a hundred miles to the
north and the farm lay at an
altitude of over six thousand feet
In the daytime you felt that you had
got high up near to the sun but the
early mornings and evenings were
limpid and restful and the nights
were cold

The thicket is merely an outpost of bush and tree clinging
at the rivers edge beseiged by a broad grassy plain
INTO VIEW a lioness muzzle dark with blood and now her
black-maned mate They stare INTO CAMERA dominate it
- « RECEDE as SHOT WIDENS

HER VOICE (contd)
The geographical position and the
‘height of the land combined to create
a landscape that had not its like in
all the world There was no fat on
it and no luxuriance anywhere it
was Africa distilled up through six
thousand feet like the strong and
refined essence of a continent

INTO VIEW Cape buffalo hostile curious giraffe
stock-still Thomsons and Grants gazelles taut as
springs all are fixed on THE CAMERA the lions now lost to
sight SHOT (BALLOON-MOUNTED) BECOMES AERIAL CONTINUES TO
WIDEN TITLES CONTINUE

HER VOICE (contd)

The colors were dry and burnt like
the colors in pottery Upon the grass
ef the great plains the crooked hare
old thorn-trees were scattered and
the grass was spiced like thyme and
bog-myrtle in some places the scent
was so strong that it smarted in the
nostrils

The plain is a great yellow-green lawn cropped close by a
thousand grazing animals There are zebra impala topi
wildebeest INTO FRAME at great distance ‘an open safari
car its noise unheard ruffling the game in its path
Indistinct the figures of two men and with them a woman

FER VOICE (contd)
The views were immensely wide
Everything that you saw made for
greatness and freedom and unequalled
nobility

The SHOT is vast and still IT WIDENS

BER VOICE (contd)
In the middle of the day the air was
alive over the land like a flame
burning it scintillated waved and
shone like running water mirrored
and doubled all- objects and created
great Fata Morgana

The CAR diminished LEAVES THE SHOT Again the plain is
tranquil mans passing an irrelevance The SHOT is now a
panorama all the world contained by the horizon Above
towering up cumulonimbus advance END TITLES

HER VOICE (contd)
Up in this high air you breathed
easily drawing in a vital assurance
and lightness of heart In the
highlands you woke up in the morning
and thought

Here I am where I ought to be

SHOT HOLDS a scene from prehistory Gods mind before the
thought of Adam

INTEXTA BALCONIED BEDROOM AT MOMBASA CLUB-DAY

CLOSE ON KAREN DINESEN in profile glistening slick with
sweat She drinks champagne languidly strokes her face and
neck tastes her salt Idle

KAREN
When is it they marry us

She is 28 aristocratic rebellious sardonic a romantic
protecting her heart by acting the realist Her intellect
is substantial of little value to a woman of her time her
emotions those of a gifted child unloved Her masks fail
to hide her vulnerability about her always a sense of
yearning that is both appetite and hunger

Geerhound at his feet Born to the Swedish purple he is

He slips her gown to her waist sponges her neck and
shoulders She shudders at the waters trickle And with
pleasure

EXTDENSE GREEN FOREST-DAY

Dawn a light mist rising From a stand of bamboo the
HEAVY PROGRESS and BELLY RUMBLINGS of a great animal moving
slowly feeding A swatch of gray hide a flash of ivory

DENYS FINCH-HATTION

In bush shorts with suspenders an old dress shirt without
a collar a felt terai He is intent not concerned all
possibilities agreed to

He is Eton and Oxford the son of an earl his familys
motto Je Respondray (I will answer) about him a detached
delight a reserve amused which holds him at a distance
he accepts all things as they are is pleased by the
absurd but he fears an obligation (a limit to his freedom)
the way some men fear a snake

His rifle is a Rigby double unadorned In the webbing of
the small fingers of his left hand two cartridges he may
fire twice reload shoot twice more--in eight seconds He
finds it fair that one day eight seconds may not be
enough

FIND KANUTHIA off his right shoulder small and wild
perpetually silent without questions because the idea of
alternativesdoes not occur Perhaps he is a primitive his
father died not knowing that iron had become steel that
there were oceans and white men who believed the land
could be possessed

There is a clarity to their relationship In the face of a
charge Denys will shoot until the animal is down or they
are overrun if Denys leaps aside or if Kanuthia has fled
when he turns for his second rifle the man who ran may
live They are not friends only honor is involved They
have stood together many times

DENYSS POV

Twenty yards to the left WASILI an old tracker wiry

-with a staff looks to Denys shakes a pouch a fine dust

drifts on the wind--away from the elephant

WIDER

Denys is very close to the tusker closer than we knew but
the animal is in heavy cover moving away and he must have
a head shot Denys makes a SOUND a low THRUMM in his
throat The elephant stops still A SILENCE

Their movements careful Denys and Kanuthia circle left

Suddenly with a GREAT SQUEAL the elephant CRASHES AWAY
through the forest no shot available

They convene the natives looking to Denys for judgment He
gives his rifle to Kanuthia THRUMMS self-deriding Wasili
HOOTS Kanuthia permits a small smile Denys shrugs They
move off after the elephant

INTAN OPFICE-DAY

High-ceilinged spartan adobe Karen in traveling clothes
Bror in a white suit stand before an OFFICER in khaki who
has help with the names from a small sheet of paper

OFFICER

On the authority of His Majestys
government residing in me I do
declare that Karen Christentze
Dinesen a female subject of the
kingdom of Denmark and the honorable
Bror von Blixen-Pinecke baron to the
king of Sweden are today and
henceforth united as man and wife
God save this company God save the
King

Well have your papers straightaway

He leaves the room As Bror turns away Karen takes his
sleeve eyes full

KAREN
Thank you for this

Slow he comes for her--but she might spring at him In a
flash he has her kisses her brutally--and she kisses him
back tries to match his strength but for her size shed’
force him to the floor

They break gleaming with sexual combat utterly equal He
grabs at the waistband of her shorts she strikes him in
the face with her fist A moment Theyre apart he might
kill her now--and she is not afraid Contemptuously slow
she takes off her shorts throws them away

She pushes past him to the door pulling off her shirt

slow trot paralleling the wagons Are they following

EXTCAMP-NIGHT-WIDE

A low corral of thorn bushes contains the restless oxen To
one side a low fire sleeping forms A Kikuyu moves round
the corral with a lantern In a flash a lion moves THROUGH
FOREGROUND then it’s still

IN THE CORRAL

A lion flees jumping the corral anothers battling an ox
Ismail’s behind Karen now trying to give her the rifle
but too late Karens at the lion with the whip It whirls
may come for her but shes attacking CRACK CRACK CRACK
And Ismail beside himself runs at the lion swinging the
rifle like a club The lion swipes at him leaps gracefully
eut of the corral

Karens dazed wipes her face licks the blood on her hand
Others are quieting the oxen Farah gives Ismail a fierce
stare The others are shaken

WITH THE OX

Bleeding fatally mauled She ASKS for Jumas knife
strokes the exs head takes its ear Her hand moves BELOW
FRAME jerks the ox BAWLS theres a fine spray of blood
in the air as it slumps from view

She leaves the corral a mess bleeding her pants covered
with the oxs gore Alone shed vomit now doesnt

AT THE FIRE-LATER

Farah treats the deep thorn scratches on her naked back
The ghost of a smile

FARAH

This simba always eats this ox But
msabu speaks to this simba de not
eat this ox or I can whip you with my
little whip

(Karen starts to laugh)
This simba thinks this memsaab is
not right it can be she is a witch
I can eat this ox another time But
msabu kills this ox with Jumas
knife

(Parahs grinning)
Msabu is bleeding she does not have
this ox This simba is hungry he

The elephant feeding his tusks very fine

Berkeley moves forward freezes -

A huge shiny patch of black hide in a glade
Berkeley signals Denys Stop

He does cant sez what Berkeley sees is puzzled

Berkeley puts his rifle to his forehead imitating huge
horns Cape buffalo

Denys searches the forest

A patch of hide there The glimpse of a heavy boss there
A whole animal browsing into a glade there Theyve
stumbled into a herd of feeding buffalo

The elephant keeps moving

Denys and Berkeley look to each other grin Carefully so
the shells dont clink each man manuevers extra cartridges
into his off hand

Intent on the elephant Berkeley moves past a buffalo he
knows is there Without warning on his right quarter a
huge bull EXPLODES from a thicket charges down on him He
PIRES AGAIN

The bull drops but the whole area is a sea of frantic
buffalo a ton apiece CRASHING BLINDLY through the forest

Denys SHOOTS left at a cow coming for him SHOOTS right at
a young bull snaps the breech open the cases ejecting
the shells in his fingers slide home

The cow has veered the bull is down

Berkeleys running switching rifles with Wasili as he
goes jumps up on the carcass of the first bull he dropped

Another bull comes straight for him

Detweiler Agnostic at least worse
I think a man of science and all
Well We took him up Mount Kenya
Spectacular day The weather kept
changing rain and then snow and then
the sun shone and the animals were
all about And when we came down
Doctor Detweiler said--it was hard
for him I think--he said there on
Mount Kenya hefound it possible to
believe in the existence of God

Triumphant she seeks reaction

KAREN
I wonder--on Mount Kenya--if God
finds it possible to believe in the
existence of Doctor Detweiler

DENYS
Upon the whirl where sank the ship
The boat spun round and round
And all was still save that the hill
Was telling of the sound

I moved my lips the Pilot shrieked
And fell down in a fit

The holy Hermit raised his eyes
And prayed where he did sit

I took the oars the Pilots boy

Who now doth crazy go

Laughed loud and long and all the while
His eyes went to and fro

Ba ha quoth he full plain I see

The Devil knows how to row

Parewell farewell--

KAREN
Youre skipping verses

DENYS
I leave out the dull parts

Parewell farewell but this I tell
To thee thou Wedding Guest

EXTON THE FARM-DAY

Karen Belknap and Denys follow a broad trail of blood
through a field of young coffee some trees broken

They come to stand over the bloody carcass of a young
bullock Karen moves upwind
BELKNAP
Lazy filthy bastards

(te Denys)
Almost a kilometer and hes near
seventy stone--can they do that

(he nods)

(

BELKNAP
Dead for the fun of it they didnt
even eat

(absent)
Its their nature to kill they dont
mean it against us

BELKNAP
Theyll be back Well see how they
like their dinner with a little
strychnine

KAREN
Nonsense

BELKNAP
When lions start on cattle they
dont quit We cant spare another ox

KAREN
(to Denys)
Is that right

DENYS
Not always Mostly

KAREN
(with regret)
Theyll have to be shot then

BELKNAP
Im married Miz Blixen--Im not paid
to hunt Ill dose ‘em good

KAREN

Denys and I will shoot the lions

(beat)
Thats all Belknap

(he shrugs goes)
Mister Belknap

(he turns)
If theres strychnine on the farm

poisoning an animal Ill have you
off the property

His look is sullen he stalks off In a moment mild

DENYS
You ought not talk that way to a man
unless you want to lose him

She looks at him hawks spits

EXTA LOW RISE-NIGHT

Just grass and sky moonlit Now in silhouette a lion
comes over the crest disappears below it And another

EXTTHE COFFEE FIELD-NIGHT

The coffee trees--like bushes--shiny in the moonlight
WIGHT SOUNDS each small noise distinct a sense of much
activity unseen Now a different sound the SCUFF of
moccasins

Karen and Denys MOVE THROUGH SHOT wary The gleam of his

‘xvifle

The SHOT looks down a row of coffee trees “They come INTO
FRAME kneel down He points

Down the corridor a white shape the dead ox Carefully
they sit to wait SUDDENLY the crazed CHORTLE of a hyena
near It startles us not them

LATER

Relaxed waiting Stiff Karen shifts Now slow he
touches her to hold her still nods

Very near a snake It slithers along full of menace

Shes calm just watches The snake moves past her boots
disappears She imitates it tongue flickering He grins

LATER

Waiting Suddenly hes intent The SOUND of something
large moving

The carcass twitches jerks the lions on the ox The SOUND
of them feeding a SNUFPLING BONES CRACKING He snicks his
safety off

THE LIONS POV

A sudden circle of yellow light and half the outline of a
man standing aiming Karens just behind him to one side
with an electric torch

REVERSE

Two lions (their eyes mostly) caught by the light Two
SHOTS very fast The light moves here and there looking
for another lion steadies returns to the carcass A
SILENCE no noise at all Its over too quickly A sense of
anti-climax the ease of these deaths
102
WITE KAREN AND DENYS

Moving to the ox Her light finds two young males dead
where they fell They stand over them A sense of their
regret

KAREN
They were good friends these two
They got it in their heads to make a
raid just to see if they could do
it Then they couldnt let it be
(a sigh)

Just a story for the ladies Now
theyre dead for that

MOVING WITH THEM AS THEY GO

The room is nearly bare much as it was when she - first
came The candlebra is gone stubby candles light the
table Theyve dressed for dinner her gown is long but she
wears no jewelry and no makeup Juma pours coffee would
retire but

KAREN
Juma Take off those silly gloves

A broad smile He removes them leaves them on the table
She smokes locks around at the room

KAREN
We should have had it this way all
the time

DENYS

DENYS

KAREN

lately learned to do

When its so hard I think I shant go

myself think about Barclay Our camp

IT can bear anything

She stubs out her cigarette smiles

KAREN (contd)
Would you like to see

DENYS
All right

She stands holds out her hand to him

KAREN
Come dance with me then
EXTTHE TERRACE-NIGHT

Denys brings the gramophone to the old stone mill table
They wind it start the record a WALTZ made for an
eighteenth century ballroom She takes off her shoes

Were CLOSE ON THEM as they dance A sense of their pain
their acceptance of it and of great love In time tears
on his cheeks Not hers

CRANE SHOT-MOVING TO A HIGE ANGLE

As he waltzes her off the terrace and out across the broad
lawn till we almost lose them in the dark

EXTWIDE ON THE HOUSE AND LAWN-DAY

Furniture many tables some makeshift holding her china

and glassware everything on sale A number of shoppers
working class people none of the settlers weve seen
before

WITE KAREN

Strolling among the shoppers watching them paw over her
things sit in her chair scoff at her art

( )
127

A LITTLE GIRL six or seven runs from the house to Karen
clutching a crystal animal hands her a greasy bank note

KAREN
Thats five rupees Its marked ten

LITTLE GIRL
Mummy said youd bargain with me

KAREN
Mummy was wrong

The little girl deesnt know what to do

KAREN (contd)
You musnt bargain on the price of
fine things--its got to be paid or
the things of ‘no value
(beat)
My father brought me this from London
when I was small It was very nice to
‘have because my sisters got nothing
at all
(a pause)
Is that all you have
(the girl nods)
Then we must exchange gifts What do
you have to give me

The girl thinks on that digs in the pocket of her smock
for an orange Karen takes it The girl runs off

Karens strolling on when Denys comes out of the house
ealis to her

DENYS
Priday

They wave he goes toward his truck Karen CALLS to him
Underhand she throws the orange--a leng way really but
still it bounces rolis toward him He retrieves it waves
another goodbye

But shes already engaged with a shopper

EXTOPEN COUNTRY AT TSAVO-NIGHT

Denys and Kanuthia silent at a small fire the plane
outlined against the night sky behind them Denys is

Staring into the fire absently takes the orange from his
pocket begins to peel it
NU

EXTTSAVO-DAY
Dawn Denys pitches his kit into the plane Kanuthias
hanging Back
DENYS

Kwenda sasa

Kanuthia doesnt move Denys is thoughtful he doesnt
dismiss the Africans in these things He walks round the
plane checks rudders and ailerons guy wires Nothing

He gets into the cockpit motions to Kanuthia to heave on
the prop The ENGINE COMES ALIVE

Denys leoks to Kanuthia shrugs Kanuthia hesitates then
giving another meaning to-the gesture shrugs himself gets
into the forward seat

WIDE

The plane accelerates across the hardpan climbs ENGINE
ROARING The planes a half-mile away the NOISE RECEDING

‘when suddenly SILENCE The plane begins to descend Long

silent moments an EXPLOSION small with the distance when
it crashes And now black smoke

EXTTHE PARM-DAY

The last of the rummage sale most items gone Karens
taking money from a shopper looks to the terrace

EER POV

Parah hands behind his back staring at the sky Now he
looks to Karen sees her watching turns away guilty

ON HER

She knows

INTDRAWING ROOMDAY

Sundown She is sitting stiffly at her desk hands crossed
waiting The SOUND OF A CAR (0S) and at the front door
A MURMURING inaudible

Delamere enters his face white stricken

KAREN
Hello D Would you like a drink

DELAMERE
If you please

( )
‘and

129

Idly she makes it hands it to him waits He doesnt
drink -

DELAMERE
Denys has Been killed His plane has
erashed at Tsavo

A long moment Not so much as a nod Now she goes slowly to
the liquor pours a glass In time

Was he damaged
She might as well have struck him

DELAMERE
(beat)
There was a fire
(long beat)
Im sorry that I am unable to
say how very sorry I an

He puts down his drink hurries away Her look after him is
vague detached

EXTTHE TERRACE-NIGHT

Just dusk Parah stands at the door washing his hands
over and over ANGLE ADJUSTING TO FIND KAREN back to
CAMERA sitting in her last chair looking out over the
lawn 7

EXTTHE NGONG HILLS-DAY-VERY WIDE

At the gravesite Karen selected for herself In the fg
the three Kikuyu whove dug the grave now stand move away
as far in the bg a procession of cars and lorries edges
up the hill stops

So far away we cant make them out people debark men take
the coffin from the rear of a truck

ANOTEER ANGLE

Still QUITE WIDE Delamere other men weve seen before

lead the way with the coffin struggling in the slippery
knee-high grass The minister perhaps thirty other
mourners Bror and his wife among them

And Karen veiled just behind the coffin Her stride is
steady She carries a small book
a

130
AT THE GRAVE-LATER

The coffin in the ground Karen nearest the grave the
others haphazard spread cut behind her At distance a few
Africans

THE MINISTER

--The sun shall not smite thee by
day nor the moon by night The Lord
shall preserve thee from all evil he
shall preserve thy soul The Lord
shall preserve thy going out and thy
coming in from this time forth and
even forevermore

ALL
(ragged)
Amen °

The minister steps back looks to Karen She removes her
hat and veil runs her fingers through her hair For the
first time we see her face it’s gaunt beautiful Her
voice will be low steady clear

KAREN
The time you won your town the race
We chaired you through the marketplace
Man and boy stood cheering by
And home we brought you shoulder-high

Today the road all runners come
Shoulder-high we bring you home
And set you at your threshold down
Townsman of a stiller town

PAN the mourners Brave men swallow Women are crying
Tears flow furiously from Brors eyes he will -not wipe
them Delamere is trembling

KAREN (0S) (contd)
Smart lad to slip betimes away
From fields where glory does not stay
Early though the laurel grows
It withers quicker than a rose

Felicity buries her face on her fathers shoulder Lady
Macmillans chin is very high Lady Byrne turns away to
stare up the hill

And Wasili alone at distance watches

KAREN (0S) (contd)
Now you will not swell the rout
Of lads that wore their honors out
Runners whom renown outran
And the name died fore the man
131
ON KAREN

Not a tear She no longer needs the book

KAREN
So set before its echoes fade
The fleet foot on the sill of shade
And hold to the low lintel up
The still-defended challenge cup

And round that early-laureled head

Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead

And find unwithered on its curls
(unsteady)

A garland briefer than a girls

Moment Her voice steadies She looks up at the hills

‘ KAREN (contd)
Now take back the soul of Denys
‘ George Pinch-Hatton whom you have
shared with us He brought us joy we
loved him well He was not ours
(beat)
He was not mine

She bends to take a handful of earth to drop into the
grave Her lips move we cannot make it out She may have
said I love you

But she cannot drop the earth the gesture is too final It
trickles away through her hand She turns to the mourners
looks at them all and seems to shrug She walks away
not toward the cars but down the slope of the hill

At distance Parah waits

She pauses once to take off her shoes FPar-off she passes
by Farah who turns to follow her down the hill

EXTTHE PARMDAY

She says good-bye to Kamante and Juma at the house walks
with Farah to her car loaded with not much luggage the
dog following Spread over the lawn hundreds of silent
Kikuyu

AT THE CAR
She kneels to the dog fondles him stands
KAREN
He is old now like you and me He

should die where he lived Will you
keep him for me until then

( )
132

PARAH
Yes msabu

He snaps his fingers The dog sits beside him Karen takes
Denyss bracelet from her arm thinks about it then

KAREN
This is very dear to me but it must
not be away from Africa Will you
wear it until I fetch it from you

PARAE
Yes msabu

She would like to touch his face shakes his hand instead
She gets into the car drives away does not look back As
she goes from the Kikyyu a ragged KWAHERI forlorn

INTMUTHAIGA CLUB-DAY

Shes at the desk writing out last instructions for the
club

KAREN
“-Letters youll just send on to this
address in Denmark My accounts

DESKMAN

KAREN

INTMENS BAR

Perhaps thirty men all ages many that we know including
the Huge Man A few are standing most sit at tables They
dont acknowledge her She pays no attention goes straight
to the bar It has no mirror

KAREN
Whisky please

The black barman hesitates looks to the young man

YOUNG MAN
Two whiskies please

Her backs to the room she locks straight ahead 0S the
SCRAPING OF CHAIRS Lifting her glass she waits for his
toast
YOUNG MAN
The King I guess

KAREN
Rose-lipt maidens Lightfoot lads
She drinks
ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind her all the men are standing Their conversation
continues only a few look at her but they are damn well
standing The Huge Man stands too his baleful glare ready
for anyone not on his feet

WITH KAREN

She knocks back her drink SAYS thank you walks briskly
through the door out of view HOLD ON THE VACANT DOORWAY
framing empty space

EXTTHE NGONG HILLS-DAY

At the crest broad and green all of that part of Africa
below

THE ACTRESS AS HERSELF in blue jeans strolls talks
directly to us

THE ACTRESS

Denys is buried down there and her
house was over there

» « that is still Africa

- THE ACTRESS (contd)
— never came back She went
home--well not home really--but to
Denmark and she wrote stories About
Parah Kamante The lions Her life
on the farm About Denys she wrote
very little

She took the pen name Isak Dinesen
Isak means one who laughs She didn’t
marry didnt fall in love

She was born in the time of Victoria

On a trip to America before she

died what she most wanted to do was

have lunch with Marilyn Monroe And
- she did

She takes a folded piece of paper from her hip pocket
THE ACTRESS (contd)

Some months after she left Africa a
friend wrote this to her

reads )
“The Masai have reported to the
i district commissioner at Ngong that
le many times at sunrise and sunset
they have seen lions on

Pinch-Hattons grave A lion and a
lioness have come there and stood
or lain on the grave for a long
time

Some of the Indians who have passed
the place in their lorries on the way
to Kajado have also seen them After
you went away the ground round the
grave was levelled out into a sort
of terrace I suppose that the level
place makes a good site for the
lions Prom there they can have a
view over the plain and the cattle
and game on it
(refolds the paper)
I hope that that was true

She walks on
WIDE ON TBE GRAVESITE
A lion saunters through the grass near the grave stops to

stand looking over the valley And now a lioness -
strolling toward him
