FADE IN

INT LUXURY APARTMENT

GARRETT (mid-20s) - good-looking self-assured probably a
little more confident than he has an excuse to be - sits
with his pretty GIRLFRIEND in front of a Christmas tree
Garrett looks less than enthused while she’s at the same
time giddy as hell

She hands him a gift which he unwraps trying to look
jazzed It’s Lakers tickets

GARRETT
Hey Lakers tickets Nice

GIRLFRIEND
I know right They’re playing
the Celtics There are three so
I thought you and I could go with
my mom when she’s in town ina
few weeks

Fuck you no

GARRETT
Wow THAT sounds great

It doesn’t sound great and Garrett can’t hand her her gift
fast enough It’s a small box She begins unwrapping
excitedly Garrett keeps a weird smile on his face She
finally gets it opento reveal a tiny shitty plastic
American flag - the kind they hand out for free at parades

GIRLFRIEND
What’s this Is this a clue

GARRETT
No it’s a metaphor Megan you
don’t want to be with someone
like me I’m self-absorbed I’m
hypocritical I’m not that good
in bed

GIRLFRIEND
Yes you are

GARRETT
I appreciate that but this will
be easier if we pretend I’m not
I think we gave it a nice four
months and I had a really good
time but let’s be honest
There’s no future here

(MORE )
GARRETT (CONTD)
You think we’re going to grow
closer but we’re just going to
learn different ways to hate each
other more So for Christmas
Id like you to have your
freedom

Off her stunned look

INT ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

ERIN - spunky adorable has no idea how nerdy-hot she is -
is on the phone crying

ERIN

I know Mom but look at me
It’s Christmas like three people
I know are in town Brandon’s
Marrying some stewardessoh
fucking whatever flight
attendantit’s miserable I
don’t want to be here
anymoreyes I think I made a
brilliant decision to move home
I just don’t want to be here for
another three goddamned months
What Oh let the turkey burn
I’m experiencing the sadness

(a few beats as she

listens )
OK OK Yes I’ll talk to you
tomorrow

(bitterly sarcastic)
Oh yeah Merry Christmas

She snaps her phone shut then looks at her door where her
too-chipper ROOMMATE is standing

ROOMMATE
Wow you look like a Muppet when
you cry
(that didn’t help)
Oh yeah we’re going out tonight

Off Erin who doesn’t say no
FADE OUT
OVER BLACK
GARRETT (PRELAP)
I hope your children get cancer

and develop more tumors than
white blood cells
INT DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Garrett sits with DAN - slight bearded nervous all the
time exists in his own universe should have a criminal
record but doesn’t - and BOX a giant of a kid who’s mowing
down a basket of fries Self-aware asshole Overly
philosophical When he talks for the most part he
doesn’t even look at the other two Dan is trying to
pretend that he’s not on the verge of tears

DAN
Why are you always so hard on me

GARRETT
Am I wrong I’m not wrong And
you’re so wrong that your kids
deserve years of stunting pain

DAN
Dude come on

GARRETT
How does it feel to know you’re
so abjectly stupid

DAN
Well I don’t know what “abjectly”
means but I’m pretty sure that’s
just your

GARRETT
Go fuck yourself

DAN
Hey

GARRETT
Get AIDS Get rampant lesiony
AIDS and die in agony

DAN
What’s with the diseases and
cursing them on me

GARRETT
I’ll take it all back Just
agree that breaking up was the
right decision you troglodyte

DAN
STOP USING WORDS IVE NEVER HEARD
BEFORE I CANNOT DEFEND MYSELF IF
I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU’RE
SAYING

Dan sits back exasperated Box continues to wolf fries
After a few beats
BOX
(mouth half-full)
You broke up with her on
Christmas day While exchanging
gifts After she’d just given
you Lakers tickets What’s so
wrong with this girl

GARRETT
She doesn’t like dogs she
doesn’t like porn and she
smelled like feet The tickets
were a great gesture except the
third was for her mother That’s
like being given a happy
childhood and then being told you
were adopted

BOX
Fine but YOU broke up with HER
and you’re sitting here being a
miserable bastard

GARRETT
Oh am I

DAN
God you’re miserable You’re
such a miserablist

GARRETT

(to Dan)
Not even remotely a word
Webster

(to Box)
Megan has nothing to do with
this so let’s stick to shit
that’s relevant

DAN

How about you stick to shit
GARRETT

What
DAN

I’1ll stick you to shit
GARRETT

What
BOX

I can handle this if you need me
to

DAN
Thank you yes I’d like that
BOX
I’m not trying to pry into your
business man but I don’t get
it You’ve been an angry dickface
all night and I’1l point out
again YOU broke up with HER

GARRETT
So
Dan leans forward
DAN
Quitter
GARRETT

So help me God I am going to
elbow you straight in the larynx

Dan looks to Box Sotto

DAN
What part of my body is that on

Box pats him on the shoulder and he sits back still
boiling

BOX
My point is that the person who
does the break-up is usually the
one who cares less Then there’s
you who’s ended a totally
insignificant part of his life
only to go out to a bar and sulk

DAN
Aw poor little Garrett his
mommy and daddy split up and he
starts to doubt true love

GARRETT
That doesn’t make any sense
whatsoever

DAN
(leaning in)
I wish you had a family

BOX
What

DAN
Garrett’s parents They got
divorced last year

BOX
Who gets divorced in their
fifties
DAN
People whose hearts die Like
Garrett’s parents

BOX
That’s some cold cold shit Ah
well two Christmases But you
can’t hate love and relationships
in general because of that

GARRETT
I don’t
BOX
You only dated her for four
months
GARRETT
I’m fine
BOX

She was the fifth girl you dated
this year

DAN
All failures

GARRETT
PLEASE shut the fuck up Dan

DAN
Swearing at me isn’t going to get
your parents back together

BOX
It just doesn’t make sense to me
This girl was a non-issue It’s
something else

Garrett stares for a minute then puts down his beer leans
his head back and closes his eyes Then he looks back
serious Or seriouser anyway

GARRETT
What if I told you that I’ve
become convinced that I can’t be
happy in a relationship

BOX
Id say that you’re twenty-five
years old and your fake misery is
annoying Cheer the fuck up and
be glad you have a job and
working genitalia
DAN
Like your mom works the
genitalia Of everyone who isn’t
your dad

GARRETT
Dan look I’m sorry I don’t
want to fight anymore

DAN
OK I’m sorry I love you too

GARRETT
I didn’t say that I loved you

DAN
Fair enough
(what)
Wait you don’t love me

BOX
Where’s this coming from all of a
sudden

GARRETT
I don’t know man I’m not even
sure if I want to be in a thing
with somebody but I keep falling
into a thing and then falling out
of a thing at the first sign of
trouble and then I’m thinking
about the next thing and how bad
I’m going to blow it but that’s
dumb because I end up getting rid
of them before I blow it

BOX
You sound like a 35 year-old
woman with twenty cats and a
hunchback Not all relationships
have to end in painful break-ups

GARRETT
Are you parents divorced

BOX
No They love each other very
much

DAN
I could get mine divorced in ten
minutes if I wanted to Mom
doesn’t know it but Dad once
made some very bad mistakes in a
public park In Norway
BOX
Stillyour parents getting
divorced and you deciding to hate
relationshipscome on you
gotta see that it doesn’t make
any sense

GARRETT
I didn’t say I made any sense
Box It’s just the way it is I
know there’s something wrong with
me At the same time though am
I a douche just because I’m
waiting to be really excited
about someone Isn’t that the
point

BOX
You can’t find an exciting girl
in Los Angeles you’re fucking
Helen Keller-level worthless
There’s a whole subculture of
girls on Craigslist who want to
be used as sexual slaves Most
of them don’t even want you to
ask their name

GARRETT
That’s not what I’m talking
about I don’t know if I can be
satisfied with someone who
doesn’t think and act exactly
like me but a womanly me with a
vagina who really doesn’t look
like me

BOX
Then just be single for a while

GARRETT
No That makes too much sense
It’s too logical Really I
probably should take your advice
but you know I’m not going to

Garrett chugs the rest of his beer and stands

GARRETT (CONTD)
I’m gonna play a round of
Centipede and get another
pitcher I expect you both to
help me drink it and later I
hope at least one of you gets
diarrhea and has to vomit at the
same time

Both Garrett and Box look at Dan who’s been smoking a
cigarette through each of his nostrils
Garrett reaches over grabs them and snuffs them out ina
mostly-empty pint glass

BOX
Do I need to remind you that you
can’t smoke in here

Dan dazed stares blankly at him

DAN
My eyes nose and throat hurt

INT BAR - MOMENTS LATER

Erin robotic playing oldschool CENTIPEDE She’s
alternately totally zoned into the game smashing the
rollerball and chugging the hell out of her beer Her
Roommate stands next to her looking worried

ROOMMATE
Youre going to be a barrel of
monkeys tonight huh

ERIN
I want to get fucked up and
become a video game legend Go
away

She does Rubbing his eyes Garrett walks up He digs in
his pocket finds a couple of quarters and rounds to the
front only to find Erin playing This should probably be a
good thing but we can tell from Garrett’s face that he’s
not happy He leans his head in over the screen

GARRETT
Umare you almost done

The machine makes the distinct sound of failure meaning
Erin has clearly died This makes her not happy and she
angrily wheels the rollerball

ERIN
What the fuck Who the fuck leans
their head in over someone else’s
game
(looking at her score)
You IDIOT I was ten thousand
points away from the high score

GARRETT
Yeah OK

Garrett looks in at the screen It’s true - her score is
just about 10000 below that of ERL and many many
thousands above the next-highest score of GAK

GARRETT (CONTD)
No way There’s no way you got
that close to Earl I’ve never
gotten that close to Earl

Back on the screen as she signs her name ERL This takes
Garrett a few seconds to process

ERIN
Do you know how goddamn long I’ve
been trying to beat myself Jesus
Christ have you no concept of
etiquette I’M REALLY MAD AT YOU

She grabs her pint off the top of the machine and makes a
move to leave

GARRETT
Youre Earl You’re the dragon

ERIN
Im a what

GARRETT
I’ve been chasing Earl for two
and a half-years I justI
thought Earl was anyou know
an Earl

She points to her chest

ERIN
Erin Annette Rankin Langford No
one really calls me Earl

Garrett’s just sort of gawking at her

ERIN (CONT’D)

Now you’re creeping me out Can
you stop looking at me like I’ma
hamsteak and get the hell out of
my way I have to squeeze a
quarter out of someone in a town
full of debit cards

GARRETT

I’m sorry it’s justI’ve never
seen a girl play this machine
before much less be good at it
and I

(catching his breath)
-I would like you to have one
of my quarters

He’s smiling and Erin allows herself a laugh

GARRETT (CONTD)
Seriously I’m sorry if I had
known about the record-setting
pace you were on I never would
have stuck my fat head in the
way

ERIN
Are you going to the bar You can
buy me a drink and I’1l forget
all about the infraction

GARRETT
That easy

ERIN
I’m poor Gifts outweigh the fact
that you’re an assumptive prick
with bad timing

Smiling Garrett takes her empty glass and heads for the
bar He bellies up and signals for a new pitcher And then
gradually this smile begins to fade

By the time the pitcher shows up he’s more or less
frowning He absently pays for the beer grabs two new
glasses and walks back to Erin

ERIN (CONTD)
Thanks What’s your name flyboy

GARRETT
UhGarrett

She notices his mood swing It’s hard not to

ERIN
Wow fuck “flyboy” Did I
really just say that
(that’s not it)
Sorry did you die at the bar

GARRETT
No I uhI think I should get
back to my friends I actually
think you’re really cool but I’ve
been in a bad mood and I think
Id rather continue this under
better circumstances

ERIN
Better circumstances

GARRETT
You know when conditions are
more favorable

ERIN
More favorable We’re drunk
playing Centipede at a bar on
Christmas What could be more
favorable than that

GARRETT
I’ve never said this to a
willing hot brilliant girl
beforebut it’s just not the
right night I wish I could
explain better but that’s all
I’ve got SoI’m going to head
back to my friends now

She softens the sarcastic edge a bit
ERIN
It’s cool I’m sure I’ll see you

around

He looks like he’s going to say something but instead
offers an awkward wave and walks off Good one Garrett

He gets back to the table to find it empty Except for a

note scrawled on a semi-wet napkin pinned under an empty
glass Garrett picks up the note which reads

FOR YOUR OWN GOOD WE’VE LEFT YOU WITH THE HOT GIRL PLEASE
DON’T FUCK IT UP - BOX

Underneath that is scrawled

YOU FAMILYLESS LOSER - DAN

-with a picture of a stick figure with an enormous penis

MOMENTS LATER

Erin is at the bar talking to some FRIENDS as Garrett walks
up and taps her on the shoulder

GARRETT
Ive been abandoned

Garrett produces the napkin and the drawing showing her
Her friends scoff Erin seems amused

ERIN
Your one friend has missed his
calling as a proctologist

GARRETT
Yeah we’re all a little scared
for him

(beat)
(MORE)

GARRETT (CONTD)
Sowhy are you getting
shitfaced and playing thirty year-
old video games in a dive bar on
Christmas

She takes a rip of her beer and looks him dead in the eye

ERIN
I’ve recently lost my ability to
deal with my own freedom
andthis is just how nerds
vent I’m lonely and I’ve lost
all semblance of hope for myself
so I’m moving back to Chicago in
three months to live with my
sister and start teaching middle
school Social Studies That was
probably more than you asked for

Ouch Garrett’s reluctant but he smiles nonetheless A
few mildly tense beatsand then Garrett decides just to
let it all out

GARRETT

This morning I broke up with a
girl who was crazy about me but I
couldn’t have cared less about
I’m just not a very good
boyfriend I’m stubborn I’m
inconsiderate and I’m generally
just looking out for myself I’ve
dated five girls this year none
of whom I’ve liked and I’m
rapidly becoming convinced that
relationships are little more
than temporary restraining orders
against happiness

(a few beats while he

collects himself)
Wow I have no idea why I just
told you all that

ERIN
Yoy
(takes a breath - her
turn)
I hate my life here so much that
I’m running back to Illinois even
though I never really tried to
figure LA out My last boyfriend
got engaged a month after we
broke up It made me feel like
his fluffer I have every
annoying girl habit especially
my inability to ever make a
meaningful decision and I tend
to attract guys who couldn’t get
a job with a traveling carnival
(MORE)

ERIN (CONTD)

(beat)
I feel like life would be easier
if I had it like my sister
She’s boring and ignorant but
she married the first guy she
fell in love with and is
annoyingly happy

(changing gears)
My turn why aren’t YOU with YOUR
family

GARRETT
Oh my family’s a little
complicated

Garrett falls into his own little world

BEGIN FLASHBACK

EXT GARRETT’S PARENT’S HOUSE - DAY

A pretty typical East Coast joint with a really really
really green lawn

GARRETT (VO)
I was home for a visit last year
when shit just blew sky-high with
my parents Out of nowhere

The front door flies open and GARRETT’S DAD comes
barrelling out golf clubs on shoulder and dragging a
suitcase that looks like it was packed by a blind handless
midget Garrett comes shooting out after him

GARRETT (CONTD)
Hey Does somebody want to
explain to me what the fuck’s
going on

Garrett’s Dad stops turns around

GARRETT’S DAD
Gare I love your mother I
really do But if I don’t get out
of here right this second and for
good I promise you I will shank
the cunt

And he’s off Garrett not sure of what to do just stands
there for a second then turns around His MOM is standing
in the doorway shaking a bit Clearly she’s heard
everything

BACK TO BAR

ERIN
Oh Christ

GARRETT
Right And that wasn’t even the
worst part

BACK TO FLASHBACK

Garrett walks up to his mother shaking his head words not
forming

GARRETT (CONTD)
Mom I1

His mother seemingly about to cry just looks on Then
just as we expect a tear to roll down her cheek she raises
her hand

GARRETT’S MOM
Hey
(indicating her hand)
Up high

She wants a high five And how she’s smiling ear to ear
When Garrett doesn’t respond she smacks his hand on hers
She exhales exhilarated Garrett is fucking terrified

GARRETT’S MOM (CONTD)
It’s been a long time coming
Your father is seeing a teller
from his bank

Garrett nearly falls over He looks to his mother
stricken

GARRETT’S MOM (CONTD)
Oh don’t feel bad for me I met
a black guy Hope you’re ready
because this year we celebrate
Kwanzaa

She pats him on the shoulder and walks back into the house
Halfway down the hall she stops and looks back at Garrett
who may or may not be having an aneurysm

GARRETT’S MOM (CONTD)
I was kidding about the Kwanzaa
thing Can you mow the lawn for
me

She disappears into the kitchen

END FLASHBACK - BACK TO BAR

GARRETT
Sothere’s that

Erin is trying to take all of this in

ERIN
Right That’s there

Beat Beat

ERIN (CONT’D)
Soyour mom upgraded huh

GARRETT
That was unnecessary

ERIN
I’m just sayingyour mom is a
size queen Good on her

GARRETT
Wow
(beat)
I like you

ERIN
I like YOU

GARRETT
You know what I also like The
weed

Off her giggle

INT OUTSIDE GARRETT’S BEDROOM - LATER

All the lights in the apartment are off but there’s a slit
of illumination under Garrett’s door

ERIN (0S)
Get the fuck out - you’re a
Travis fan

GARRETT (0S)
You just now noticed the poster

INT GARRETT’S BEDROOM - SAME
Theyre sitting on his bed smoking a joint

ERIN
Wellthis shit is strong

GARRETT
Saw them for the first time in
two-thousand in DC They played
with
Oasis
ERIN
No shit I saw that same tour
back home They’re great That’s
the curse of LA though -
everyone knows every band And
they all get overplayed on the
radio For all the supposed
creativity here this town is
almost original in its
unoriginality

GARRETT
This is important what’s your
favorite movie

ERIN
Why is that important

GARRETT
Because I work in the film
industry and that means I’ma
cliched halfling of a real
person Originally I’m
unoriginal and just answer the
question please

ERIN
(sarcastic)
Ohhhhhhh I work in the film
industry I hang out at Area and
do stepped-on coke
(does finger guns)
Finger guns finger guns

GARRETT
I’m a low-level executive
assistant who reads such high-
concept projects as AIR BUD NINE
Guess what He’s in the NBA now
and testing the waters of Free
Agency Kill me

She smiles

ERIN
Shawshank My favorite movie is
Shawshank

Garrett stands up Man is he stoned

GARRETT
(quoting SHAWSHANK bad
Morgan Freeman
impersonation)
I hope I can make it across the
border I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand
(MOR

E)

GARRETT (CONTD)
I hope the Pacific is as blue as
it has been in my dreams I hope

ERIN
Zihuatanejo

Garrett sits down She just blew his mind And then
sheepish

GARRETT
Shawshank is just ahead of Top
Gun I feel like I need to come
clean about that

ERIN
Admit to me right now that you
like the volleyball scene Admit
it

GARRETT
Happily Do you know how
confusing that was to me as a
kid I can’t hear “Playing with
the Boys” without feeling the
urge to oil myself up and
exercise in jeans

ERIN
God I knew it You’re so fucking
gay

GARRETT

Yeah that’s me

ERIN
Seriously you’ve got that vibe
I could tell it when you looked
at me for the first time tonight
It was like “Man I hope that
girl playing Centipede has hot
guy friends”

GARRETT
Oh yeah

ERIN
Totally Your mouth said “Please
have my quarters” but your heart
was clearly saying “Please
pretty girl please have a
gigantic man-cock”

GARRETT
I will admit that I crave
gigantic cock but I’m not gay
I’m the only one with that
dilemma

ERIN
Is that why you haven’t made a
move yet

Garrett considers this for a second and then he just goes
for it They’re making out It’s getting hotter and
heavier and then from through the wall the sounds of
TAKE MY BREATH AWAY from the sex scene in TOP GUN blares

Garrett startled stops He yells at the wall

GARRETT
Dan

From through the wall

DAN (0S)

Are you guys intercoursing now
All that Top Gun talk made me
long to hear this

Garrett and Erin separate

GARRETT
Dan FUCK

ERIN
Has he been listening this whole
time

GARRETT
Yes But he’s never actually
affirmed that out loud before
Through the wall

ERIN
This has happened before You LET
him listen

GARRETT
I don’t LET him but how can I
stop him Believe it or not he
has noble intentions

Another knock

DAN (0OS)
Can I get an answer here You
know I can’t pass out until
you’re at least an inch deep

GARRETT
(to Erin)
Sorry
ERIN

It’s OK Actually I don’t even

think I care
(MORE )
A few soft pats on the wall and Dan presumably
The light goes out and we hear kissing

bed
black

ERIN (CONTD)
I was just pretending so you
wouldn’t think I was slutty

GARRETT
(to the wall)
Dan Have you actually been
listening the whole time

DAN (0OS)

What No

(beat)

Get busy living or get busy
dying

(a few more beats)
OK Goodnight

GARRETT

EXT GROVE FARMERS MARKET - DAY

It’s the next morning

Then

goes to

in the

Garrett and Erin sit at a table

both of them pushing their food around in front of them
They’re half hungover and half awkward
decides he should say something

GARRETT

I feel like this should be more

than a one-night stand

ERIN
Really

GARRETT

Yes and I say that knowing how
completely stupid it would be to
continue this considering you’re

moving and I’m a heartless
jackass

Erin thinks

Then Garrett just

ERIN
I don’t want to not see you
again Actually I think I want
to see a lot of you

GARRETT
I don’t know anyone like you
You’re unique and you have really
awesome boobs

ERIN
I don’t even care that you’re
conceited and self-absorbed
because I know they’re both
facades

GARRETT
Please don’t tell anyone that

ERIN
I wont

GARRETT
I’m really glad we had this talk

ERIN
Me too I just wish we would
have had it at your place rather
than getting up and going to
breakfast because there’s a good
chance I’m going to throw up

They both go back to their food now smiling
INT STAPLES CENTER - NIGHT

Garrett Box and Dan sit in the crowd at a Lakers game
surrounded by hot blondes and rich assholes with their
families Garrett is the only one we can see wearing a
Celtics jersey Box looks confused Dan keeps taking nips
out of a flask looking around like a crack addict

PA ANNOUNCER (0S)
THREE POINTER BY PIERCE

Garrett stands clapping

GARRETT
That’s how you do it Paul

He sits back down Box now with a quizzical look on his
face

BOX
What do you mean she’s moving to
Chicago

GARRETT
I mean she’s packing up all her
shit taking it out of her
apartment going to a different
apartment in Chicago putting her
shit there and staying in
residence for an extended period
of time

BOX
Why

GARRETT
I don’t know she said something
about moving in with her sister
and finding a teaching job
Middle school Social Studies

The crowd cheers for a Lakers basket

GARRETT (CONTD)
(yelling towards court)
Defense fellas defense
(to Box)
So it works out well

BOX
How’s that

GARRETT
It’s like a practice relationship
for me She’s cool she’s hot
she likes all the things I like
And then at some point it HAS to
end so I can look at the whole
thing until then as like a
learning experience She’s like a
Pre-Season Girlfriend To get me
ready for the real thing
Whenever that is

BOX
That doesn’t sound that good

GARRETT
Why not Of course it does Don’t
try to kill my buzz because
youre fat

On the court another basket for the Celts
GARRETT (CONTD)
(yelling towards court)

YOU SHOW THOSE PRICKS KEVIN

In the row in from of him a GUY turns around He’s with
his WIFE and KID (about 6 or so)
GUY
You mind watching the language

game with my kid here

Dan moves at the guy like a raptor right in his

DAN
And your wife don’t forget your
wife Don’t act like she’s
invisible

Garrett stiff-arms him back

GARRETT
Jesus relax

Dan sits back takes another swig from his flask

DAN

their kid to a circle jerk

Laker

Once again Garrett stiff arms Dan out of the way Then to
Box

GARRETT
What’s your point

BOX
Isn’t it obvious How can you be
happy that the only girl youve
been stoked about in like two
years is moving out of town How
the hell does that make any
sense

THAT hits home Garrett looks up as a Lakers player flatly
rejects a Celtics player headed for the hoop

GARRETT
(yelling to field)
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU GET YOUR
FUCKING SHIT ROCKED LIKE THAT

The guy stands up in Garrett’s face now

GUY
HEY I’m not going to tell you

DAN

No you’re not going to tell him
again You can’t tell him again
because you never told him the
first time You’re not the boss
of him There is no telling

(a beat as he refuels

from the flask)
I will find you in the parking
lot and embarrass you in front of
your child And then I will take
your wife I mean that

The guy sits down Garrett and Dan sit down Garrett’s just
kind of staring blankly

GARRETT
(to Box)
Butshe’s a practice
girlfriend

BOX
Did you ever call any of the
other girls you dated your
girlfriend Practice or not

The look on his face tells us that no he hasn’t

GARRETT
Son of a bitch

On Garrett horrible realization on his face as something
happens on the court and the crowd roars The Guy in front
of Garrett stands making an especially big exhibition of
cheering for the Lakers showing off for his kid

GUY
Oh yeah Oh yeah Way to go LA

Garrett leans over to Box

GARRETT
Give me your program and your
pen Now

Box does Garrett rips a page out of it and begins
scrawling frantically on it Then he folds it up and taps
the Kid on the shoulder The Kid turns around He leans in
and hands him the paper

KID
What

GARRETT
You know your alphabet

KID
Kinda

GARRETT
This is all those bad words I was
saying earlier I spelled them
out for you Study them and then
say them all at the same time
when your parents have a bunch of
people over

He leans back The kid opens up the paper eyes going wide

KID
Yesssssssss

Garrett stands up and walks off
INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Erin’s at a vomitous trendy LA place with her HOT FRIENDS
all drinking wine and laughing

FRIEND 1
Youre totally getting played

ERIN
I am not
FRIEND 2
She’s right No guy can be
serious about a girl he knows is

moving

ERIN
I really think it’s not like
that

FRIEND 1

Did you sleep with him Are you
still sleeping with him It’s
like that

ERIN
It isn’t And even if it was
the sex is amazing so I don’t
care

FRIEND 1
It can’t be that good

From behind them

GARRETT (0S)
No seriously she’s not lying
I’m really awesome

The girls turn around to see Garrett there smiling
not offended

FRIEND 1
Oh God I’m sorry

Garrett sits at the table

GARRETT
Don’t be If I were you guys I’d
probably be just as wary
Luckily I’m the greatest person
who’s ever lived

He looks at Erin smitten

GARRETT (CONTD)
Hi

ERIN
Hi

They kiss each other It’s embarrassingly heartfelt
turns to her friends

He’s

He

GARRETT
True story This evening my
friends pointed out to me that
I’m a jerk I’m bad with girls
and there are a litany of reasons
this should fail They’re
probably right But you know
what I don’t care I’m going
down swinging

Ocooocoh smooth The girls are almost won over Then to
Erin

GARRETT (CONT’D)
I brought you something

He produces a small bottle of sand like the ones you can
buy in any souvenir shop Erin takes it and looks at the
label - written in Sharpie is “Zihuatanejo” She’s
stunned

ERIN
Zihuatanejo Really

GARRETT
No Venice Beach But I thought
it was a sweet move

She looks at him for a second and then they start kissing
again no regard for anyone else at the table One Friend
leans over to another

FRIEND 2
Please stop them before I have to
start touching myself

INT GARRETT’S OFFICE - DAY

Garrett sits there reading a script and jotting down
random notes in the margins when his boss WILL a typical
movie exec-type comes out of his office with three more
scripts He holds them up so Garrett notices then sets
them on his desk

WILL
When you’re done with that one
here are three more

GARRETT
Why even bother You don’t read
my notes and no one ever listens
to a single one of my ideas

WILL
UmI don’t know What sounds
better that you’re paying your
dues or building a strong
creative portfolio

GARRETT
I’ve been an assistant for three
years All I want is for someone
to just ACT like I have a chance
of getting promoted before I’m
fifty I’m going to die on the
phone with a shitty producer
trying to talk me into the next
big Avril Levigne project That
idea horrifies me Will

His mood is brightened as we hear an IM pop up on his
computer Erin Likely

WILL
That the girl

GARRETT
Yessir

WILL
She still moving

GARRETT
She is

WILL

Circle of life There are
exactly two types of girls in
this world Girl A won’t fuck
you and Girl B won’t be fucking
you much longer Approach each
day knowing that and you’1ll be
much happier

He walks back into his office leaving Garrett to ponder
BEGIN MONTAGE SEQUENCE

--Garrett and Erin ride beach cruisers down the beach in
Santa Monica They’re laughing It’s so fucking gay

--Garrett in his office clearly overwhelmed with work and
trying to talk on the phone while Will barks something at
him looks at his phone as it vibrates and reads “ERIN”

In the middle of it all he picks it up reads the text and
smiles When he looks up Will is glaring at him He
continues to glare And glare

--In a bar they’ve both got margaritas that are too big
for them But they’re chugging Garrett’s winning and he
tips Erin’s glass up so she has to drink faster She does

--They’re fucking Really hard It’s animal While she
rides him Garrett is slapping her boobs around That
should be annoying but she doesn’t seem to care So he
keeps slapping amused

ERIN
(out of breath)
Get it out while you can Six
more weeks

GARRETT
(excited)
They barely move

--Garrett at work making copies chewing on his collar
reading a script He’s intermittently writing feverish
notes in the margins

--Box and Dan hitting balls at the driving range
noticeably annoyed that Garrett is once again texting and
giggling After a particularly awful shot Dan walks over
slaps the Blackberry out of Garrett’s hand and slaps him
in the face Then he calmly walks back and starts hitting
balls again Garrett tries to pick up the Blackberry and
Box smashes it with a driver

--Garrett in a meeting with a bunch of arguing EXECS He
tries to cut in and eventually succeeds at saying
something The HEAD EXEC just points to the door Garrett
leaves the room

--The couple go at it again this time a little slower
with a little more feeling In between kissing

GARRETT (CONTD)
Are you sure you have to go

ERIN
(hesitant)
Yeah

GARRETT
Good I’m getting sick of you

She smiles More kissing

--Erin packs up stuff in her apartment The only thing
she’s left unpacked it seems is a picture of her and
Garrett that sits on top of her TV

--Garrett at his desk at work still reading scripts It’s
dark and the clock reads 815 He gets a call from Erin
and wants to answer but he refuses the call and keeps
reading

--Erin comes out of the bathroom with a girly beauty mask
on Garrett’s laying in his bed reading a script but he
looks up when she kicks him

She points to her face and to the cannister she’s holding
clearly wanting him to put one on as well He shakes his
head no No No

--Five minutes later Garrett staring into his bathroom
mirror a white beauty mask caked on his face Erin’s
beaming

GARRETT (CONTD)
I look like a gay Al Jolson

He puts out jazz hands and shakes his head She laughs
hugging him from behind

--At the movies Garrett holds Erin’s hand We can’t see
the screen but it must be wrenching (for a girl) because
Erin is holding her breath trying not to cry Garrett
finally notices

GARRETT (CONTD)
(whispering)
What are you doing

She shakes her head no

GARRETT (CONTD)
Are you choking

No again He looks at the screen then back at her

GARRETT (CONT’D)
Are you holding your breath so
you don’t cry

She shakes no vigorously almost crying

GARRETT (CONTD)
Yes you are

She breaks

ERIN
(harsh whisper sucking
wind)
Itfuckingworksifyoudon’tstopmeyou
dick

Garrett can’t help but laugh at her expense

--After the movies he’s still laughing a little trying to
reassure her She’s pushing him away pissed but
eventually he wrangles her and she gives in to a hug She
cries there for a minute and he holds her and soon they’re
not even aware of the hundreds of people milling about
around them

--They’re doing it again but this time it’s mostly soft
and smooth lovemaking

Suddenly they seem to become self-conscious of their
melodramatic passion and laugh a little Garrett dismounts
and rolls over Erin hugs into him He stares at the
ceiling she stares at the wall After a few seconds

GARRETT
You sure you have to leave

ERIN
I think so
(beat beat)
Yeah

Garrett looks at the clock
GARRETT
You have nine hours to
reconsider

She starts tearing up

GARRETT (CONT’D)
I hate tomorrow

She snuggles in harder both of them without anything good
to say

END MONTAGE SEQUENCE

INT GARRETT’S CAR - DAY

Garrett is driving Erin is in the passenger seat both
looking beyond fucking miserable They won’t even glance
at each other Then all of a sudden Erin sees something
out the window

ERIN
Pull over Pull over right now

INT PAWN SHOP - DAY

The two bumble around the crowded sort of chintzy shop
Garrett a little more curious than Erin who’s ona
mission

GARRETT
I don’t need anything

ERIN
Fuck you you get a going away
present

GARRETT

Youre going away not me

ERIN
Shut UP and let me look jerkoff

GARRETT
Wow you’re nice today What am
I getting a coal-filled stocking
made of pain

ERIN
Justdon’t ruin this for me
This is special

GARRETT
So special that we waited until
we were on the way to the airport
so you could stop in a pawn shop
that’s probably going to give me
tuberculosis

She shoots him a look He shoots her one back They’re
both on edge

She keeps looking eventually stumbling over to a display
case with a bunch of trinkets One of those trinkets is a
little crystal bear with a red bow wrapped around its neck
She regards it longingly Garrett notices

GARRETT (CONTD)
The bear

ERIN
Yeah

GARRETT
Great I can look at the pretty
prisms while I’m getting plowed
by a drag queen

ERIN
(seems to ignore him)
My mom used to have one just like
it My dad got it for her the
last Christmas he was at home
It was the only thing he gave her
that year

GARRETT
So he’s a spender

ERIN
(distracted)
They shut off the electricity the
next day He’d been laid off for
a month

GARRETT
And prudent

ERIN
Mom still has this on her
nightstand She’s never moved
it Other guys got her nicer
stuff and she still likes that
the best

GARRETT
The flame still burns

She whips around at him

ERIN
This isn’t fucking funny He
never came back

GARRETT
Erin that was likefifteen
years ago C’mon My parents
got divorced last year You
wanna talk about hanging on
It’s pointless

ERIN
You think you have the market
cornered on bad memories You
think you know it all because you
can ball someone up and throw
them away Fuck you

She goes to storm out

ERIN (CONTD)
I’m going home

He looks after her suddenly realizing he’s been a complete
dick But he doesn’t seem to get it

GARRETT
We don’t have time to go back to
your apartment

Without turning around on her way out the door

ERIN
I was talking about Chicago

And she’s gone the door clanging behind her Garrett
gives it a second lets it sink in Then from behind the
counter

SHOP OWNER
Good thing for you we’re out of
coal

Isnt that truth Garrett skulks out the door defeated

EXT LAX — DAY

Garrett’s car pulls up to the curb and Erin’s out before
he even comes to a complete stop She’s pulling on the
trunk before he even releases it angry and already sort of
holding her breath Eventually Garrett walks up to her

GARRETT
C’mon give me a break This
sucks for me too

ERIN

Oh so that means you get to
judge me I don’t get to be sad
about things It’s OK that this
is over because relationships
just end Well some don’t

(breath holding for a

second)
You know my fucking boyfriend in
college told me he loved me for
the first time the night before
he went out and OD’d on drugs
At least he TOLD me before he had
the courtesy to go and DIE
THATS how you END things

She rips her last bag from the trunk slamming it down
just avoiding Garrett’s fingers

GARRETT
JesusI’m sorry God he
really died

ERIN
NO but he fucked my roommate and
I really really wanted him to

She goes storming for the automatic doors

GARRETT
Erin don’t go like this

She turns around

ERIN
Why You’re just like all the
other boyfriends Garrett And
the end of the day you’re not
important either If you were I
might have stayed

It’s a total fucking lie but she’s going to cling to it
Garrett watches her go gets in his car Slams the door
He sits there and stews for a second maybe about to rage
and then he jumps out and starts running for the door

An angry black AIRPORT ATTENDANT stops him

ATTENDANT
Where you goin’ sir Can’t leave
your car at the curb

GARRETT
Ieee

ATTENDANT
Can’t Leave your car At the
curb

Garrett rubs his eyes looks up

GARRETT
That girl in there

ATTENDANT
Aw shit you chasin’ a girl
GARRETT
Yes
ATTENDANT
For real
GARRETT
Uh huh
ATTENDANT

She got a ass on her

GARRETT
Like the wind

ATTENDANT
The hell does that mean

GARRETT
I have no idea

The Attendant smiles wide at him

ATTENDANT
Go on now

Garrett slaps him on the back and runs in

INT LAX - SAME

Garrett whirls around looking for Erin and he finally
spots her standing near the entry to the security line TSA
AGENTS ready to take her ticket

GARRETT
ERIN

She stops He runs up to the end of the line but people
are giving him looks so he stops So does she But she
doesn’t turn around The Agents start looking at her
funny

GARRETT (CONTD)
OK look I know I said all the
wrong things and Holy Christ
I’m stopping you in an airport
security line which is the worst
cliche of this decade since I
can’t chase you to the gate
anymore I’m sorry But you
called me your boyfriend and
even if I’m worthless I gotta
hang on to that It’s been a
long time since the title of
“boyfriend” gave me goosebumps
instead of dry heaves

People let him move up closer to her now

GARRETT (CONTD)
UmI’ve just run out of all the
things I thought I was going to
say

She doesn’t turn around He looks at the Agents

GARRETT (CONTD)
Is she holding her breath and
trying not to cry

They nod at him a little scared

Garrett walks up to her spins her around and hugs her
Tight

GARRETT (CONTD)
(whispering)
I love you I’m sorry I’m an
idiot

ERIN
(through sobs letting
it go)
I love you too I’m sorry I’m so
much more emotionally mature than
you

GARRETT
This shouldn’t end Fuck the
miles Just because you’re
getting on a plane and flying
away doesn’t mean you have to
leave me

They just stand there hugging tightly

EXT LAX - MINUTES LATER

Garrett walks out head held high not a care in the world
And then he notices that his car is gone Flabbergasted
he tracks down the Attendant

GARRETT
Where’s my car
ATTENDANT
Oh that They towed that shit
GARRETT
Why You said you wouldn’t tow
me
ATTENDANT

Hell I did I said “Go on now”
Didn’t say nothin’ ‘bout no car

Not a whole lot Garrett can say so he just starts laughing
and hails a cab He gets in at peace with the universe
As the cab drives off he sticks his head out the window and
looks back at the Attendant

GARRETT
Have fun dating my mom

The Attendant watches him go no clue what he’s talking
about

SUPER FIVE WEEKS LATER

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Erin sits at a table with two pointedly Midwestern couples
CORINNE and PHIL (married) and RON and KAREN (engaged) and
a single guy DAMON Everyone is kind of doing their own
thing but they’re all more or less paying attention to
Erin who’s giggling and chatting we presume with Garrett
via cell phone

While Corinne and Karen keep looking at each other like
“This is so cute” Ron and Phil exchange annoyed and
bemused looks Damon just finds the whole thing
entertaining

ERIN
(into phone)
No I don’t need to know
thatoh Godwhat What
SHUT UP SHUT UP YOU ARE NOT
SERIOUS
(to table)
You guys you guys Garrett got
tickets to the Killers for when
he’s here next weekend
MORE

ERIN (CONTD)
(back to phone)
Oh God baby you’re amazing I
love you

Phil and Ron exchange a look pissed and trying to hide it
Corinne and Karen look at them pissed not trying to hide
it

KAREN
You said those tickets were sold
out three months ago

RON
Well they effing were Except
apparently forthis guy

PHIL
I refreshed Ticketmaster for a
goddamn hour trying to get those
tickets A whole goddamn hour

RON
Can you just get things because
you live in LA It doesn’t work
like that right I meanhe’s
an effing wizard or something
right

CORINNE
He’s not a magician he just
CARES enough to go the extra mile
for her That’s what happens at
the beginning of a relationship
You care about one another enough
to try harder

Pointed look at Phil He could not be less happy

KAREN
(to Ron)
Is that how it’s going to be
The second we get married I can’t
get tickets to anything anymore
because you’re lazy

RON
Holy crap really Really Did
I or did I not clean out the
entire effing garage last week
when your mother visited I
guess that doesn’t effing count
I guess I’m nothing unless I can
produce your favorite band every
time you sneeze

KAREN
This is about tickets not

sneezing
(MORE)

KAREN (CONTD)
And they’re not even my favorite
band but I’m glad you care
enough to know that

Damon just laughs as Ron’s about to say something when they
all hear Erin finishing up her phone conversation

ERIN

(into phone)
OK baby I know I miss you so
much I love you too ‘Night

(to everyone)
I’m so sorry guys it’s just with
the time difference and our work
schedules the only time we get to
talk is like nine o’clock at the
earliest

Everyone has officially changed demeanors

PHIL
Oh that’s great though that you
guys get to talk Because you
make an effort to do so And
that you feel so comfortable that
you don’t even have to leave the
table

ERIN
I know right God this is so
weird for me You know today my
kids all made him “Welcome to
Chicago’ cards because I talk
about him so much

Ron is about at his breaking point

RON
Your thirteen year-olds made
cards Middle schoolers
Really That’s effing retarded

CORINNE
That is so sweet

Corinne and Karen vocally swoon Phil tries Ron scowls
Damon continues to be tickled by this

DAMON
It’s not often you’ll hear from
other female teachers in the
lounge that the new girl is off
limits because her boyfriend is
the greatest guy on the planet

ERIN
Really They all said that

DAMON
According to popular legend he
has a nine-pound cock and cured
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome last
Tuesday Which sucks because I
was TOTALLY working on that one

Damon garners some looks from the rest of the table
Apparently they’re not used to his level of humor Erin
thinks he’s funny though

PHIL
Um sohow’d he end up getting
those tickets then

ERIN
Oh his boss knows their tour
manager

KAREN

I was just going to say that it’s
nice that Garrett knows how to
take advantage of a situation
like that Ron’s boss keeps
offering us a week at his
timeshare in Orlando but Ron
doesn’t like Florida

That’s it for Ron

RON
Oh what the eff Karen What the
eff It’s at friggin’ Disney
for cripes sake I’m thirty
years old What the hell do I
want with a Disney vacation

KAREN
(half whispering to
table)
He’s still upset that his parents
never took him there as a kid

RON
KAREN

Before Ron’s head actually explodes Erin’s phone rings and
she answers

ERIN
Hello Oh hi Benjireally
Really Oh my Godno I’1l be
home in just a few minutes
Thanks

She hangs up and beams at the table

ERIN (CONTD)
Garrett sent me flowers they’re
at the front desk with Benji I
gotta go OK

Phil Corinne and Karen wave goodbye Corinne and Karen
leeching off of Erin’s glow as Ron slams what’s left of
his beer Damon gets up with her

DAMON
I’1l walk you out I gotta jet
too

They exit and Phil buries his head in his hands

EXT RESTAURANT - SAME
Erin and Damon stop on the sidewalk

DAMON
I’m going this way you live up
that way right

ERIN
Yeah thanks for walking me out

DAMON
You knowpretty soon your
sister is going to start putting
pressure on you To marry and
stuff Because according to my
mom you’re twenty-five now and
that means your uterus is almost
a coffin

Erin laughs

DAMON (CONT’D)
But don’t let it get to you I
had an LDR a couple of years ago
It can work if you don’t try to
make it into more than what it
can be know what I mean

Erin considers this As excited as she is it’s clear she
already has some doubts She waves politely and walks off

INT DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Garrett Dan and Box are all at their table again Garrett
is finishing up a text message giddy Dan looks on
furious

DAN
This fucking shit has got to
stop

Garrett finishes and looks up

GARRETT
What

DAN

The texting The phone calls
The flowers The emails The
porn emails And the smiling
I’m literally so sick of the
smiling that I want to killa
puppy In fact a litter of
puppies

Behind them a table of girls reacts unfavorably One of
the girls wearing a PETA shirt breaks her glass in her
hand

GARRETT
You literally don’t know the
meaning of the word ‘literally’

Dan glares at him then reaches for the bag sitting next to
him in the booth extracting a small dictionary He begins
flipping through it

BOX
What’s this

GARRETT
That’s his newest portable a
dictionary

Not looking up

DAN
Give me three more weeks and I’m
going to be Fuck-You smart

BOX
He’s got a point though This
thing has kind of taken over your
life

GARRETT
Hey a couple of months ago you
were the one sitting right across
from me saying that the way I
approached relationships was all
wrong and now I’m in a good one
and I’m feeling healthy about it
and you’re telling me that’s a
bad thing

Box thinks for a second

BOX
Pretty much

GARRETT
Come on

BOX
I’m just sayingyou suck right
now At least if she was here
youd be hanging out even if she
was tagging along to everything

GARRETT
I hang out

BOX
Dude this is the first time
youve been out in two weeks

GARRETT
Do you know how much work I have
to do on a daily basis Do I
EVER get out of work before eight
PM on any given day

DAN
Can someone fucking tell me how
to spell ‘literally’

Box mocks Garrett

BOX
Oh work work work Stop being
fucking faggy If you cut your
phone callInternet chat time
down by even an hour a night you
could do more work and get out of
the house once in a while

GARRETT
I think I use my time pretty
wisely
FLASHBACK
To Garrett’s room He’s on the phone with Erin giggling
GARRETT (CONTD)
What’s your favorite
cerealCrispix Who the fuck
are you Crispixobviously
Count Choculawell because I
fucking enjoyed my childhood
He looks over at the clock It’s 830PM
LATER

He looks back over It’s 1130PM He doesn’t care

GARRETT (CONTD)
Baby Can we switch to G-chat
I got a cramp

LATER

He’s typing away at his computer It’s 100AM He’s still
unfazed

LATER

It’s 300AM He’s on the phone AND the computer at the
same time watching the ‘Baby Panda Sneeze’ video

GARRETT (CONTD)
Ha He sneezed and he woke her
up that’s so cute

LATER

Garrett stresses over iTunes He’s creating a CD called
No Matter the Miles Mixtape There are a bunch of sappy
cheesy 80s ballads in the queue

ANOTHER DAY

Garrett asleep on his desk at work Will walks by and
dumps a box of screenplay brackets on his head Garrett
wakes with a start

Across the hall a super-cute fellow assistant BRIANNA
laughs at him He smiles and tries to play it off

END FLASHBACK

GARRETT (CONTD)
In fact I would go so far as to
say that I’m productive

DAN

Youre a troll It’s like her
vagina has possessed you We
have thin walls you know I
hear you masturbate at least
twice a night

(serious)
And really you should give
yourself like twenty minutes in
between jacks because I read
that you can chafe your penis
canal

GARRETT
Can’t you douches just be happy
for me for like three minutes I

have a girlfriend
(MORE)

GARRETT (CONTD)
I’m going to be overly occupied
for the immediate future It’s
the way things work

BOX
Fine except she’s not a real
girlfriend

GARRETT
What’s that supposed to mean

BOX
Aw come on you think this
charade you’re trying to pull off
has even a hint of legitimacy
You think you’re not going to
burn out You think you’re NOT
going to cheat on her She’s NOT
going to cheat on you Do you
live in this world or do you just
frolic every day with My Little
Ponies

GARRETT
I think you’re a pessimist I
think this is going to be fine
for a while It’s good It
works

BOX
I’m not a pessimist I’ma
realist Are you moving to
Chicago

GARRETT
No

BOX
She moving back here

GARRETT
I doubt it

BOX
Then really what’s so good
about it

And there it is Garrett shows some resolve but he’s got
some worries as well

INT ERIN CORINNE AND PHIL’S APARTMENT - DAY

All three of the apartment’s inhabitants are getting ready

for work difficult because it’s a small two-person place
with a tiny kitchen and one bathroom

It’s a struggle Eventually Phil grabs his stuff kissing
Corinne on the cheek offers Erin an awkward high-five and
walks out the door The second he’s gone Erin spins on
Corinne

ERIN
This is NOT working

CORINNE
Oh stop being a baby

ERIN
Why couldn’t you just tell me
Cor It’s so easy You just
open your mouth and tell your
little sister that your apartment
is too small for three people
and then I get to say no and
still be in Los Angeles with my
boyfriend

CORINNE

Don’t you EVEN try to turn this
around on me You were
miserable I was doing you a
favor and if I told you it would
be cramped you’d have said no
and probably still been miserable
because you wouldn’t have had an
excuse to talk to your

(quotation fingers)
‘boyfriend’

ERIN
If you make quotation fingers at
me again I will set your bed on
fire tonight with you in it

CORINNE
SweetieI’m just looking out
for you I know he’s wonderful
and I think it’s great but
youve GOT to find someone you
can be with long-term

ERIN
I AM with that someone I’m just
not right next to him for a
while that’s all

CORINNE
Or in the same city

ERIN
I get it

CORINNE
Or the same part of the country

ERIN
Please stop

CORINNE
Two time zones away

ERIN
CORINNE

CORINNE
I’m just saying

ERIN
Jut because you panicked about
getting married and ran to the
altar with the first guy whose
penis you touched doesn’t mean
that I have to get married to
stop the world from ending

Corinne looks sheepish

ERIN (CONTD)
What

CORINNE
I sorta lied about that

ERIN
Phil wasn’t your first

She shakes her head both embarrassed and excited to be
telling Erin this story

CORINNE
(a whisper)
I gave Stephen Thomas a blow-Jjay
in tenth grade My braces tore
his foreskin

Erin recoils

ERIN
Jesus Out of the two words in
blow job you have to shorten
‘job’
(thinking)
Stephen Thomas wasn’t
circumcised

CORINNE
What Of course he was

ERIN
Do you even know what a foreskin
is

CORINNE
It’s theskinon the front of
theyou know the forenot
really

Erin annoyed grabs her coat and bag and heads out the
door She slams the door leaving Corinne blushing

INT MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Erin is in the front of a room of THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD
STUDENTS It is 100 impossible for her to hide the smile
on her face She’s almost over-smiling if that’s even a
thing

ERIN
AaaaaandI guess that’s pretty
much all we need to cover on
Hitler shooting his cousin-wife
dropping a cyanide pill and
being burned in a bomb crater by
his own loyalists Questions

The kids are fucking freaked out One girl warily raises
her hand

TEENAGE GIRL
Umyouryour boyfriend is
coming into town today right

Glee

ERIN
Yes

The kids visibly relax

ERIN (CONTD)
Oh But I’m also glad that
Hitler died Very bad man that
one Did I mention he married
his cousin

She’s smiling too much The kids are uneasy again
Luckily he bell rings and the kids go flying out of the
room Erin looks over to the door to find Damon standing
there

DAMON
I hope you told them the story
about Eva Braun being Hitler’s
cousin It’s a crowd-pleaser

ERIN
Naturally

DAMON
Except it’s not true

ERIN
I was told to teach They did
not say I had to teach facts
Next week how the Fraggles built
the American railroad system

DAMON

The Doozers built the American
railroad system The Fraggles
ran around like mental patients
and destroyed it

(mock angry)
I hate that no one ever thinks of
the Doozers’ feelings

ERIN
I’m sorry

DAMON
You know Hitler actually slept
with his half-sister’s daughter
and then she committed suicide
Why not tell them about that

ERIN
Why do I get the sense that you
find that slightlyerotic

Obviously these two get on well and there might even be a
trace or two that it’s more than that But not much

Then there’s a knock at the doorand Garrett’s standing
there grinning from ear to hear Erin squeals shocked

GARRETT
I heard there’s a social studies
teacher in here that I totally
want to get with
(mock surprise)
Oh Erin you’re here too

She runs over jumps on him hugs him and kisses him
After a few seconds she pulls back

ERIN
What are you doing here

GARRETT
I sortacouldn’t wait So I
got an earlier flight Google-
mapped your school rented a
Hummer and drove over here

ERIN
You rented a Hummer That’s so
gay Do we have to beat up
someone smaller than you later

GARRETT
Seriously it was the only thing
they had left I’m happily
paying two hundred and twenty
dollars a day so that everyone on
the highway can make small penis
jokes

More kissing And now it’s getting a little awkward for
Damon which Erin must suddenly realize

ERIN
Oh baby this is Damon

Garrett walks over shakes his hand

GARRETT
Garrett nice to meet you Heard
a lot about you

DAMON
Ohyeah

GARRETT
Oh yeah she loves you Thanks
for keeping her sane what with
the living situation and all

Damon seems kind of taken aback by this and now realizing
he’s the third wheel begins to make his exit

DAMON
Alright wellI’1l let you guys
get to your Hummering Have fun
destroying the ozone commies

He walks out and Garrett and Erin keep kissing Soon it’s
heating up and then all of a sudden they realize they’re
in a fucking school and they separate Then Erin leans in
and whispers in his ear

ERIN
You know what’s inappropriate
Teachers that don’t wear
underwear to school

SMASH CUT

INT ERIN CORINNE AND PHIL’S APARTMENT - LATER

The two of them crash through the door making out
furiously and ripping off clothes

Erin literally tears her skirt getting it off As she’s
undoing her bra Garrett is struggling to get his shirt and
jeans off

ERIN
HURRY UP

GARRETT
(through clothes)
I swear I’ve never had this much
trouble getting undressed before

ERIN
GET YOUR PENIS INSIDE ME

Naked she falls down on the couch Seconds later Garrett
is free of his textile bonds and on top of her

There’s some wild sex-pumping action for a few
secondsand then out of the corner of his eye Garrett
catches something

Standing in the kitchen is Phil In his undershirt and
presumably boxers Mouth full of sandwich He looks like
a wax figure in a museum He is utterly horrified

Garrett just stops still on top of Erin She smacks him
for stopping then looks over and sees Phil And then she
stops And she slowly grabs a pillow and covers up her
boobs

PHIL
(mouth full)
Hi
(a few beats)
I’m Phil
(a few PAINFUL beats)
This is my sandwich

ERIN
Umhi Phil

GARRETT
Yes Hi

And they continue to stare at each other Also Garrett is
still inside Erin which is weird for everyone at this
point Phil looks legitimately like he might have just
been spooked retarded

ERIN
UmPhil

PHIL
If youre going to ask if I saw
you naked I did I saw you very
naked Please don’t tell

Corinne
(MORE)

PHIL (CONTD)
Because you look good and she’s
not inyou know shape

ERIN
I was justI was just thinking
that maybe you could leave the
kitchen so we could finish

PHIL
There are bedrooms for that

GARRETT
Sorry man There wasn’t a lot
ofthinking happening

No one has the courage to make the first move

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

Erin and Garrett come blowing through naked clearly
having just made a break for it They look at each other
freaked but quickly their libidos win over and they’re
back to hardcore sex

LATER

Garrett walks out into the living room pulling one of
Erin’s bigger (not on him) shirts down over his privates
Phil’s in the living room watching him as he worldessly
collects his clothing

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Everyone is out to dinner - Garrett and Erin (who are
disgustingly all about each other) Corinne and Phil and
Ron and Karen Each couple is kind of conducting their own
conversations mostly since Garrett and Erin can’t seem to
keep their hands off each other

Eventually Corinne speaks up

CORINNE
So Garrettyou’re a producer

GARRETT
Is that what she told you Well
at least she lies to make me look
good

ERIN
I did not tell her that I told
her a hundred times that you’re
an assistant

CORINNE
Assistant producer isn’t it
kind of the same

GARRETT
That would be nice But no I
send a lot of emails run a lot
of errands read a lot

KAREN
Do you get to meet any famous
people

GARRETT

Sure They’re around the office
a lot always coming in for
meetings and stuff

KAREN
Like who

GARRETT
WellI mean I guess whoever’s
famous right now

KAREN
The Killers

This causes Ron to start gulping his drink and loudly chew
on his ice

GARRETT
Mostly people who are actors I
don’t meet too many musicians

RON
How about Pamela Anderson She’s
hot I bet she even gives it up
to assistants

KAREN
Ronald

He goes back to chewing on his ice loudly making a
spectacle of it This registers with Garrett

CORINNE
Do you have to be in Los Angeles
to be an assistant Could you be
an assistant to someone in
another town Like in Chicago

Garrett laughs a little

GARRETT
Maybe But if I did that I
couldn’t sleep with a whole bunch
of wannabe-actresses and hide it
from your sister

CORINNE
Right But then you’d be CLOSER
to my sister
(changing gears)
Well I need to run to the
bathroom

Karen reluctantly stands up and follows Corinne out of the
booth Erin looks to Garrett

ERIN
I kinda have to go They’re
going to say bad things about you
and I have to pretend like I
care Also all girls sign a
contract when they’re 12 saying
that you’ll always group to the
bathroom

She kisses him on the cheek and gets up The girls walk
off Karen shocked and Corinne annoyed

As soon as they’re gone Garrett turns back to the guys at
the table Phil still can’t look at him Ron continues to
suck in ice and chew it loudly Then without warning he
spits part of a cube right at Garrett hitting him in the
shoulder

GARRETT
Thathas never happened to me
before

RON

Do you have any idea the trouble
youre causing for us chief

GARRETT
Chief Didn’t mean to cause
trouble nineteen-fifties beat
cop
(to Phil)
Phil am I causing trouble

Head down

PHIL
I don’t wanna talk about it

Ron turns to Phil pissed

RON
Aw what the eff Phil

GARRETT
Ron Tell me what’s bothering
you

RON

Oh I’1l tell you what’s bothering
me bucko You’ve created a
prime-time problem between me and
my fiancee The flowers the
emails the effing Killers
tickets You think some sappy
phone calls and Internet butt-sex
crap or whatever makes you a real
boyfriend I’m in the trenches
dude where the real hell
happens

GARRETT
Can I ask you a question Did
you learn English from watching
Monday Night Football Because
seriously that sounded like John
Madden giving dating tips

RON
Dude your boyfriend act is
getting old You do a quarter of
what we do We’re here all the
time We have real
relationships We have to make
eye contact when they yell at us
and hang out with their stupid
effing friends It’s not just
surprise Hummer rentals and
showing up for the weekend And
by the way Hummers are for
pussies

GARRETT
Waitso you’re pissed because
I’m paying attention to my
girlfriend as best as I can and
she’s enjoying it and your
chicks are mad because they’re
not getting the same kind of
attention

RON
In a nutshell

GARRETT
Then why don’t you just pay
better attention to them

For a second it looks like this might be something that
Ron just never considered and he looks to Phil for backup
Phil of course is worthless Eventually Ron turns back
to Garrett

RON
You’re on thin effing ice
partner

Garrett laughs Ron off but all the same the wheels are
turning Is he only 14 of a boyfriend

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Garrett and Erin lie there neither of them sleeping just
kind of curled up on each other

GARRETT
Does this make you happy

ERIN
What you being here No Id
much rather be listening to
Corinne and Phil struggle through
four minutes of sex before
watching Fox News

GARRETT
No I mean our situation

He turns over towards her

GARRETT (CONTD)
Is this making you happy Is
this what you want

Erin pulls back

ERIN
Are you seriously trying to break
up with me right now

GARRETT
No no not at all I justI
come home at night every night
and I look forward to talking to
you But I know that the flowers
and the gifts and whateverthey
don’t make up for me not being
here And I just don’t want
to

She stops him putting her hand over his mouth

ERIN
If I didn’t want to do this Id
have stopped it before it
started There was never a part
of me that didn’t want to be with
you from the second we started

talking
(MORE)

ERIN (CONTD)
Please don’t screw that up by
acting like a typical guy right
now Please

They just stay there for a second looking at each other
Than Garrett rolls to his back

GARRETT

I am thinking about taking an
assistant’s position here In
town I’m sure I can just
transfer Corinne says so And
she’s always right about
everything

(mostly joking)
I hate your sister

He kisses her on the head It’s still easy but there’s a
realization now that this is going to be harder than they
thought

INT MIDWAY AIRPORT - DAY

Get it Midway Huh Huh Because this halfwayOK
moving on

Garrett is gathering his few small bags getting ready to
head to the security line

ERIN
Please call me as soon as you
land

GARRETT
I will

He hugs herand she latches onto him like she’s never
going to let go When they finally pull apart she’s
crying

GARRETT (CONTD)
Not holding your breath anymore

ERIN
Don’t need to I think if I was
drowning you’d just save me

anyway
He kisses her - it’s a good kiss - and then he grabs a pen
out of his pocket and scrawls something on her hand Then
he’s off doing everything he can not to look back

She looks down at her hand Written on it is “SIX WEEKS”

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dimly lit Garrett walks into his apartment bags on his
arm He’s noticeably fatigued and his face isjust sad

He heads back into the dark hallway to find the bathroom
door open We can see Dan on the toiler inside a sight
line to the TV The volume is deafening Dan is on the
crapper Crapping

Garrett walks back into the living room and grabs a remote
from the table muting the TV Back into hallway

Dan looks up from a HOME AND GARDEN MAGAZINE at Garrett
who’s stopped in his tracks Dan looks worried as hell

DAN
Heyo buddy Thinking about
building a terrarium

GARRETT
Wow

DAN
And I’m pushin’ one out

GARRETT
I can see that

DAN
Im sort of scared

GARRETT
I don’t want to know

DAN
It’s bad

GARRETT
Even more of a reason not to tell
me Dan whatever you want to
tell me just don’t tell me

DAN

(no hesitation)
It’s coming out funny And it
burns It feels like I’m
crapping jalapeno soft serve
And there’s a lot of it I
looked before I have no idea
how I’m going to flush this
Even soft

(noticing Garretts

mood)
Why do you look like you hate me

Garrett walks past him and into his room Follow into

INT GARRETT’S BEDROOM - SAME

where Garrett drops his bags looks around and falls
down on his bed He is a spent man

From the bathroom

DAN (0OS)
Gare Are you mad because the
door’s open or because I talked
about my feces

Garrett rubs his eyes

GARRETT
It’s neither Dan Believe it or
not I’m not even slightly mad at
you

DAN (0S)
Youyou like this

GARRETT
That is not what I said

DAN (0S)

Because I’ve been trying to bring
up an open-door policy for a
couple of months now

GARRETT
No Dan I actually want that
less than I’ve ever wanted
anything

He thinks a minute - does he want to have this conversation
with Dan Deciding he does and though it’s very
uncomfortable he walks back to the bathroom door While
they talk Dan is aggressively wiping his ass

GARRETT (CONTD)
I miss her Jesus I don’t want
to be all feelingsy-wheelingsy
but goddamnit it I miss her I
love her and I miss her

Without missing a beat

DAN (0S)
Of course you miss her She’s
your girl If you didn’t love
her so much it wouldn’t hurt It
hurts because it’s great
Everyone knows that

(more wiping he looks

at his tissue because

we all do)
Good GOD some of this is orange

(MORE)

DAN (0S) (CONTD)
What the hell do I eat when I’m
drinking What do you guys feed
me I think I have Crohn’s

But Garrett’s got nothing He pulls his cell phone out of
his pocket and starts to text as he walks back to his room
We hear Dan pulling up his pants buckling his belt and
flushing

DAN (0S) (CONTD)
It’s going it’s going it’s
goingyes Oh no Fuck
(to Garrett)
Dude can you bring me a wire
hanger This shit’s clogged

GARRETT
Wire hanger Use the plunger
dipshit

DAN (0S)

Oh yeah OK “Use the plunger”
Fuck you “plunger” Why don’t
you make up some more words while
you grab me a goddamn wire
hanger

Garrett now scared out of his mind runs out into the hall
and to the bathroom door He noticeably refuses to look
down

GARRETT
How often do you clog the toilet

DAN
What I don’t know five or six
times a week

GARRETT
Five or six What do you do
when it happens

DAN
The fuck do you think I do I
jam a wire hanger in there like
I’m doing an abortion and I clear
it up Haven’t you ever been to
Sunday School

(looks around at floor)

The only other thing we have in
here is a stick with a suction
cup on it

GARRETT
What do you do with the hangers
when you’re done Where do you
keep them Dan Tell me now so
help me God

DAN
Keep them Dude you’re fucking
SICK OK Like any normal
person I bury them in the
fucking backyard What is your
problem You act like you’ve
never seen a wire hanger before
Jesus

Dan walks out miffed Garrett just keeps looking straight
ahead not really surprised anymore

LATER

Garrett lays on his bed looking at his phone It’s
100AM Sighing he writes and sends a text message to
Erin It reads only I MISS YOU TERRIBLY

It sends and he shuts his phone tossing it beside him
After a few seconds there’s a response With all due
speed he grabs the phone and flips it open only to find a
message from Dan

GARRETT
(reads text)
No wire hangers at Walgreens

shitpenis

Garrett closes the phone tosses it closes his eyes

INT GARRETT’S OFFICE - DAY

looks like he hasn’t slept in weeks All of a sudden a new
email pops upGarrett scrambles to open itand it’s an
Evite

GARRETT

As he clicks his mouse harder and harder he notices that
Brianna is standing behind him She’s looking super super
cute and super super scared

GARRETT (CONTD)

No not Custer holy Lord bad

ORE)

GARRETT (CONTD)

I don’t feel ambushed by Indians
or your people he’s just iconic
and it’s the first thing that
popped into my head it was very
bloody

(such a losing battle

he gives up)
Suckity fuck fuck Iam done
talking I am justI am done

Somehow this brings a smile to the poor girl’s face She
sort of looks around for a second and then leans in

BRIANNA
It’s OK I know how frustrating
it can be

GARRETT
What being ambushed Again not
by Indians

BRIANNA
No I hear you on the phone OK
I did the long distance thing a
few years ago It sucks

She smiles and starts to walk off

She turns back

BRIANNA
Phone sex

GARRETT
Phone sex

BRIANNA

GARRETT
But it’s sobasic cable circa

ninety-nine a minute

She turns and walks off again
BRIANNA

He waves after her thinking

GARRETT

not to be too loud It’s borderline frightening

ERIN

wasn’t thinking about anyone
else’s vagina

(beat)
Were youum were you you
knowthinking about Marky
Marks dick or anything

ERIN
Garrett No

GARRETT
Well OK then we were there
Just next time I think we need to
figure out the details
beforehand

ERIN
Yeah

GARRETT
You want to just keep going

ERIN
I think that moment has passed
don’t you

GARRETT
I do now I’11 call you back

As he says this he grabs for the remote turns on porn
ERIN
BabyI’m sorry We tried I

love you

Garrett looks in his pants Whatever he sees it’s
painful

GARRETT
Christ I didn’t know they could
turn that color

She winces

ERIN
I’m sorry

He snaps his pants back into place

GARRETT
(overly chipper and
sarcastic)
No worries I fucking love the
fuck out of you

He snaps his phone shut staring at the wall Looks at the
porn

GARRETT (CONTD)
(to himself)
Well this is familiar

He wants to be angry but he simply doesn’t have the
energy Listless and beaten down he looks around him
Sees the bottle of lotion With no regard for the state of
his clothing he splashes a few huge squirts inside his
pants and mechanically begins masturbating There is no
pleasure here There is no eroticism There is only an
angry defeated man trying to assuage blue balls

He looks around his room again finds an old piece of
pizza and starts eating

Looking straight ahead and with a mouth full of pizza he
talks to himself deadpan and devoid of life

GARRETT (CONTD)
Oh yeah Oh yeah My hand is a
pussy My hand is a pussy Fuck
me baby Yeah Do me like that
Make me love you I’m on top
I’M ON TOP More More More
More

All of a sudden he finishes There is no joy in it He
opens his pants and looks in

GARRETT (CONTD)

(to himself)
Hmmmmmmwhat’s semen what’s
lotion It’s a mystery
Goodnight

He blandly continues eating the pizza

INT MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Erin’s packing up her things readying to leave as Damon
comes walking in

DAMON
Hey

ERIN
Hey you Just getting ready to
leave

DAMON
Got a second

ERIN
Sure what’s up

He doesn’t look happy

DAMON
I kinda drew the short straw

ERIN
For what What’s wrong

DAMON
How come you weren’t at the staff
meeting this morning

ERIN
There was a staff meeting Shit
No one told me I had a gyno
appointment that I couldn’t get
at any other time so I took half
a personal day

Damon sits down at a desk

DAMON
Um OKso last night at the
board meeting for whatever
reason the board and the city
decided to rezone the district

This doesn’t sound good

ERIN
Okaaaaaay

DAMON
Starting next fallhalf the
kids from this school will be
bused to Cedar Cliff instead

ERIN
Half

DAMON
Yeah

ERIN

Half What the fuck

DAMON
And that means

ERIN
Oh Jesus They’re going to have
to lay half of us off

DAMON
Yeah

ERIN
Who

DAMON

We don’t know yet We won’t know
until Christmas

Erin is not happy

ERIN
So basically what you’re fucking
saying is that I have four
goddamn months to worry my ass
off about this shit

DAMON
If I were a sailor yes I would
have said that in that manner

She thinks on this for a second

ERIN
Only one way to handle this
then

INT BAR - NIGHT

Erin and Damon throw back a shot that looks like rancid
hell grimace and laugh like idiots They are fucking
WASTED

ERIN
You know what Right now I
can’t even tell that I’m so
scared I’m ready to puke My
mouth tastes like pain

DAMON
My mouth tastes like pee

Erin totally oblivious to everything around her squeezes
her boobs together and sucks in a huge breath arching her
back

ERIN
(loud)
GOD I wish Garrett were here
I’m so fucking horny Long
distance is LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME

This gets Damon’s attention He turns to say something to
her but he can only watch as she rubs herself like a total
harlot Other people are watching too Damon’s gaze
lingers for a few seconds too long Yeah he wants her

DAMON
That must berough

ERIN

(still to loud)
Ugh and I’m fucking on my period
right now too which makes it so
much worse And it’s especially
heavy this month So I’m even
hornier and moody as hell and
bleeding like a stab victim

A PATRON sitting next to them abruptly gets up and moves
the hell away from the bar The BARTENDER amused but
officious comes over to Damon

DAMON
I know We should probably be
going

EXT BAR - MINUTES LATER

Damon waits with Erin for her cab Neither of them have
jackets and it looks like it might be a little bit chilly
Damon probably absentmindedly - but maybe not - rubs her
shoulders to keep her warm Fucked up as she is she
doesn’t stop him but then again she doesn’t really seem to
notice

DAMON
What are you up to this weekend

ERIN
Going to LA to visit Garrett
DAMON
Ah
A cab pulls up
ERIN

This must be me

She turns to hug Damon It lingers a little bit - and this
time it’s both of them hanging on Erin finally pulls
back but doesn’t seem unnerved Damon helps her into the
backseat and shuts the door Once in she rolls down the
window

ERIN (CONTD)
Hey

DAMON
Yeah

ERIN
Youre a swell guy you know
that

DAMON

Aw gee thanks Mrs Cleaver

We can tell though that he totally wants to kiss her
But she waves innocently rolls up the window and the cab
speeds off leaving Damon a little speechless

INT MIDWAY AIRPORT - DAY

Erin’s waiting in line to board when her phone rings She
looks at the number doesn’t know it Answers anyway

ERIN

(into phone)
Hello Yes this is she Oh hi
Yes Yes

(look of real concern)
Oh Oh Are you sure
thatwell no I’m not worried
if you aren’tsure no Tuesday
evening is fine Thank you

She hangs up seriously worried as she boards the plane

INT LAX —- LATER

Erin’s plane lands and she immediately turns on her phone
She still looks worried as hell As it powers up she sees
that she has a text message It’s from Garrett BABE
STUCK AT WORK SO SORRY CAB TO MY PLACE WILL PAY FOR IT
MEET YOU THERE LOVE YOU )

Annoyed now she snaps the phone shut

EXT APARTMENT —- LATER

The cab pulls up to Garrett’s apartment Erin looks his
car’s in the driveway She’s none too happy as the CABBIE
helps her get her bags out of the trunk

INT APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

It’s very very low-lit The front door opens and Erin
struggles in with her bags just about at wits’ end

That’s when she notices that Garrett’s decorated the entire
apartment in candles creating a walkway that leads to the
hallway entrance where he’s standing

This cools her rage inferno dramatically

GARRETT
I figured you wouldn’t too much
mind the cab ride if I came here
to do this You knowbecause
of the candles
(beat)
Romance and whatnot

She laughs and walks over to him dropping her bags They
start kissing and within moments it’s pretty passionate

That’s when they hear the door to Dan’s bedroom open Just
a crack We can see barely his eyes and part of his head
from inside Garrett and Erin stop kissing Garrett
doesn’t even turn around

GARRETT (CONTD)
Dan What did we talk about

After a few seconds

DAN
It’s very lonely in here And
dark

GARRETT
I didn’t tell you to turn out
your light

Another few seconds

DAN
I can’t find the light switch

GARRETT
Dan

DAN
I just stepped on something It
felt like bacon I hate bacon

GARRETT
You love bacon

DAN
Not in the dark
(beat beat beat)
Hi Erin

ERIN
Hi Dan

DAN
I’ve missed you

ERIN
I missed you too

DAN
How long will you be here

ERIN
Until Sunday night why

DAN
Just wanted to know how long I’m
going to be captive in here

GARRETT
I ONLY TOLD YOU TO WAIT TO COME
OUT UNTIL WE GOT TO MY ROOM YOU
DICK

Before he can even finish Dan slams the door to his room
Erin and Garrett laugh then go back to making out
Garrett begins to tenderly but aggressively drag her back
to his bedroom

INT GARRETT’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

As they crash through the door they’re still going at it
but it’s subdued more romantic less animal than we’ve
normally seen them

And then we notice that it’s more Erin holding back with
Garrett about to pop his cork trying for more Reaching
his limit he throws her on the bed and tears his shirt
off jumping on her

They kiss for a few seconds and then Erin moves away

ERIN
Babe wait

GARRETT
OK How long
(two seconds pass)
Can I be done waiting now

He tries to move back in She playfully pushes him away
laughing

ERIN
Baby stop it

GARRETT
Stop it Do you remember any of
the violently dirty things you
told me you were going to let me
do to over the last eight weeks
Do you even think for a second
that it’s not my goal to try all
of them in the next three
minutes
ERIN
JustI need a second to just
look at you OK I missed you
and I just need a minute to look
at you

Hard to argue with that especially when she’s being so

sweet

just take a few breaths to touch and stare

Then all of a sudden Erin starts frowning
right away it’s serious and his mood changes

GARRETT
What’s wrong

She sort of struggles to get it out

ERIN
When I was boarding the plane
this afternoon I got a call from
my gyno

GARRETT
OK

ERIN
I had an abnormal pap I have to
go back in for more tests on
Tuesday

GARRETT
Oh God Is that really bad It
sounds bad but I have no idea
what you’re talking about Do I
have an STD now

ERIN
No And I don’t know I’ve never
had one that was abnormal before

GARRETT
Is it like uncommon

ERIN
Oh no the doctor told me that
everyone has an abnormal pap at
some point It’s abnormal to not
be abnormal sometimes

GARRETT
Oh Welldid she sound
worried

ERIN

Actually no she made it sound
like it was totally no big deal
But I’m still freaked out

He nods his head and lays down next to her They

Garrett knows
drastically
Garrett takes this in for a second

GARRETT
Soyou’re worried though Not
to sound insensitive butI can
put my penis in you right

Erin offended sits up a bit

ERIN
Is that the only reason you want
me here

Garrett sits up too agitated

GARRETT
What

ERIN
You just want me here so you can
fuck me is that it

GARRETT
Are you out of your mind You
have been a participant in the
sexual buildup I’ve been
getting painful erections at work
because of the things you’ve
written to me How can you
expect me to not want to fuck you
right now If I were you I’d be
offended if I tried to do
anything else

ERIN
God you can be such an asshole

Erin stands up

ERIN (CONTD)
I don’t Feel Like fucking

GARRETT
Making love

ERIN
Oh you’re such an idiot It has
nothing to do with that Do you
understand that the health of my
vagina is in question Do you
have any concept of how quickly
that can kill a sex drive

GARRETT
I’m starting to get a concept

ERIN
Jesus Garrett between this and
losing my job

GARRETT
Whoa wait what Losing your
job When did you lose your job

ERIN
Do you listen to anything I tell
you

GARRETT

Um I pretty sure I listen to
everything you tell me which is
why I’m so fucking surprised at
the moment that you don’t have a
job anymore

Erin thinks about this for a second

ERIN
Oh OK OK I might have
forgotten to tell you

GARRETT
Pretty big omission

ERIN
I was stressed I’m sorry The
night I found out I got drunk
with Damon and I was hungover the
next morning

GARRETT
You got drunk with Damon Just
you and Damon

ERIN
Yes
(she thinks)
Why Does that upset you

Garrett considers this

GARRETT
I don’t know I feel like it
should upset me

ERIN
Sodoes it

He continues to think

GARRETT
I don’t know Let’s come back to
that Tell me why you don’t have
a job

ERIN
I do For the moment But they
rezoned our district and now half
of our kids are going to another
school so they’re laying off
half the teachers I could be
one

GARRETT
Yikes That sucks

He walks up to her and hugs her

GARRETT (CONT’D)
Sorry You probably had a shitty
week

ERIN
I did have a shitty week I’m
stressed and my vagina has a cold
and I just don’t feel sexy

Still hugging

GARRETT
I know how to help that

ERIN
Oh How

GARRETT
I can put my dick in your mouth

She immediately shoves away from him slaps him on the
shoulder and leaves the room Without fucking him
Garrett rubs his crotch pained

INT DIVE BAR - NIGHT

It’s later that night and Garrett and Erin are at the same
dive bar where they met They’re at a big table with Dan
(looking nervous) and Box (looking nervous for Dan) and a
bunch of Erin’s friends from the dinner scene earlier

Aaaaaaaaaaandit’s pretty silent Not a lot of talking
going on It’s especially icy between Garrett and Erin
whose body language tells us that they’d just as soon be
miles apart at the moment

Dan is highly uncomfortable with the silence He’s
sweating a little He goes to say something but Box slaps
a hand on his shoulder Dan turns to him jumpy

BOX
Whatever it is you think you want
to sayconsider whether or not
these people want to hear it

DAN
OK

BOX
Think Dan

Dan nods turns back to everyone still nervous He zeroes
in on a blonde girl across the table

DAN
Pretty blonde lady across from
me Would I be correct in
guessing that you’re wearing a
mini-skirt

She’s unnerved and rightfully so

FRIEND 1
Iyes Why

Dan begins to laugh creepily as if he wants to say
something but can’t get it out

DAN
Well point of fact if I may a
bit of trivia as it would seem
that I knew that because I
believe I can see your vagina

That’s it Garrett’s forehead instantly hits the table
Box leans backwards and looks at the ceiling The Friend
slams down her glass gets up and leaves the table The
rest of the Friends follow her and Erin is close behind
them

After a few seconds Garrett picks his head up looks right
at Dan simply nods incredulously at him stands up
silently and walks to the bar

LATER

Garrett does a shot by himself

LATER STILL

Garrett does a shot by himself

AND STILL LATER

Another shot It’s been a good twenty minutes And then
from behind him

BRIANNA (0S)
Garrett

He wheels around and there’s Brianna Sweet goddamn
She’s all tarted up and if there’s any doubt that she was
hot as hell before it’s gone Her shirt is going a long
way to redefining “low-cut”

GARRETT
Brianna

BRIANNA
I know I usually keep it toned
down for the office

GARRETT
No it’s justyou’re in a bar

BRIANNA
I’m the designated donkey for the
evening For every evening

GARRETT
Have you ever been drunk

BRIANNA
I have not

GARRETT
Why do you hate merriment

Her smile tells us she thinks he’s adorable

GARRETT (CONTD)
Hey c’mon - you can’t know who
you are really until you’ve
been drunk

BRIANNA
Been drunk or been drunk with
you

She smiles Then from behind both of them

ERIN (0S)
Hi I’m Erin

They both turn around Sure enough it’s Erin Garrett
puts both his arms in the air in a “TOUCHDOWN” signal

GARRETT
It’s Erin My girlfriend
Yaaaaaaay Erin say hi to
Brianna her desk is near mine at
work

ERIN
Hello Brianna-her-desk-is-near-
mine-at-—work

There’s some poison in that but if Brianna noticed she’s
not letting on

BRIANNA
Hi It is SO nice to meet you
If you only knew how much he
talks about you when he’s not
talking to you I hear about you
all the time We all do You
have a small fan club We hold
bake sales

Brianna’s really trying to be as nice as possible but it’s
coming off as pandering to Erin She hates Brianna

ERIN
You hear that babe I’m more
popular than you are at work

GARRETT
It’s true

BRIANNA
I’m so glad you’re here I was
really hoping to meet you

GARRETT
She has been hoping

Brianna’s still sincere Erin wants her to die

ERIN
Wellthis is me Ta-da

Sensing that this could get awkward

GARRETT
So who’s doing a shot with me

He does six-gun-fingers to both of them and then realizing
he’s pointing at Brianna he turns painfully so he’s just
pointing at Erin She glares

BRIANNA
Nice finger guns Actually I
have to get back to my friends
(to Erin)
So nice to meet you When are
you going to be back out

She’s so nice Erin wants badly to punch her

ERIN
Soon God willing If God wills
it Ill be back soon I guess
it depends on your belief in God

Brianna doesn’t know what to do with that so she turns to
Garrett

BRIANNA
See you Monday

She walks off Garrett waits for Erin to turn to him

GARRETT
Sowhat shot are we doing

Yeah they’re probably not doing a shot Dan walks up
looking after Brianna

DAN
Who was that fuckable fuckable
fuckable girl that you were
talking to Because I would fuck
her

Garrett glares at Dan but what’s the point Dan shrugs
no reason to try to dig his way out of the hole now

INT GARRETT’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Erin wakes up in Garrett’s bed Garrett with his arms
wrapped around her still sleeping She tries to move but
he squeezes her tighter kisses her on the shoulder It’s
impossibly sweet even if he’s unconscious Maybe even
more so He opens his eyes

GARRETT
Hi

ERIN
Hi

GARRETT

I’m sorry

And that’s all it takes The dam broken she turns over
and starts kissing him He wakes up after a few seconds
realizes what’s going on - he’s going to get lucky - and
wordlessly they just flow into it Best morning sex ever

EXT LAX - NIGHT
Garrett’s car pulls up to the drop-off lane Garrett and
Erin get out get her bags They hug They hug and hug

and hug and she cries harder and harder They never even
say a word

INT CORINNE’S CAR - NIGHT

Corinne is driving with a puffy-eyed Erin agitated
CORINNE
What a prick

ERIN
Corinne I’m not telling you this
so you can bash him I’m telling
you this so I can tell you this
and so Ill feel better

CORINNE
Oh I’m sorry you want me to be
constructive when he treated you
like a farm animal in West
Virginia He treated you like
crap and he’s an asshole

ERIN
He’s not an asshole

CORINNE
OK fine

ERIN
Thank you

CORINNE
Oh I was being sarcastic he’s an
asshole
(off Erin’s look)
You have to get out of this
relationship

ERIN
Stop it Now you’re just being
rude You don’t even know the
whole story

CORINNE
I don’t have to know the story
It’s not about the story Are
you moving back to LA

ERIN
I don’t know If I lose my
jobI’d think about it

CORINNE
Wow that sounds like conviction
What if you keep it Is he
moving to Chicago

ERIN
No but that’s

CORINNE
No that’s EXACTLY the point
Sweetie how long do you want to
date

(MORE)

CORINNE (CONTD)
How long do you want the rest of
your life up in the air How
long are you going to put
yourself through the stress

Erin is defiant

ERIN
He’s worth it

She means it Corinne can see that

CORINNE
OK youre right He IS worth
it
(for emphasis)
But is IT worth it
(waiting)
And what about Damon

Erin’s head whips around

ERIN
What ABOUT Damon Corinne

She turns to her sister and really there’s nothing but
compassion in her eyes

CORINNE
He’s here kiddo He’s here

Erin turns toward the window ready to cry She takes a
sec composes herself and turns back to Corinne

ERIN

You bring up Damon in that

capacity again and I will tell

Phil about your double-

penetrating vibrator
Corinne goes fire engine red then green her hand covering
her mouth
INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - LATER
Erin walks in throws down her bags Paces for a second
Picks up her phone dials
INT GARRETT’S BEDROOM - SAME
Garrett’s phone rings and he answers it excitedly

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

GARRETT
Youre home That took forever
ERIN

Why couldn’t you just comfort me
GARRETT

What
ERIN

When I got there On Friday
Why were you so unable to just
make me feel better

GARRETT
Jesus really

ERIN
Yes Yes really

Garrett’s annoyed but he’s doing his best to compose
himself

GARRETT
I’m sorry I should have done
better I should have listened
But please believe me when I tell
you that I was physically unable
to do so

ERIN
Really Your ears shorted out
the second I walked in the door

GARRETT
No weyou KNOW we spent the
last eight weeks emailing the
nastiest shit back and forth to
each other After a week I was
ready to implode and even
jacking off I was building up
enough come to keep a Mormon
pregnant until the rapture It’s
fucking hard when you’re not here
and I want you so bad

ERIN
So that’s it

GARRETT
That’s it Erin my brain
stopped working Do you know how
hot you are I saw you and my
brain stopped working I needed
you Do you have any idea how
much I’ve been masturbating
lately thinking about you I
took one day off and I hada
nocturnal emission I am
literally wearing out all the
joints in my left arm

(MORE)

GARRETT (CONTD)
I am not kidding I’m going to
need fucking Tommy John surgery
Seriously when we are done
talking I’m hanging up and I’m
calling Dr James Andrews to save
my fucking arm

ERIN
Doctor who

GARRETT
I knew that one was going over
your head

ERIN
OK so fine then admit it this
is only physical for you

And that’s it for Garrett He loses it

GARRETT
Are you out of your fucking mind
Did some toxin on the plane give
you Down’s Syndrome How could
you possibly say something like
that

ERIN
It’s certainly all you wanted

GARRETT
It was all I wanted AT THAT
MOMENT AT THAT MOMENT My GOD
how could you even try to deny
that everything that happens
between us now is so much more
than just physical Those eight
weeks we spend apart All we do
is NOT touch All I do is
listen So you’ll have to
forgive me if all I can think
about when I see you for the
first time is sticking every
appendage I have in your pink
parts

Erin past her breaking point just starts bawling

GARRETT (CONTD)
Yeah alright fucking cry
That’s your goddamn ticket out of
everything Well I’m not
punching that bullshit this time
Call Damon you tell him more
than you ever tell me anyway
I’m sure he’s next in line

He snaps his phone shut

ERIN
Babe I’m sor

She hears a click He’s hung up She drops her phone
crying

BACK TO GARRETT

He let’s out a frustrated wail throws his phone on his
bed and stalks out of the room

INT MEETING ROOM - DAY

Another meeting of the Execs at the studio Garrett’s
sitting in the background again He looks pissed off
tired and at the end of his rope

The Head Exec pulls a sheet off a pile

HEAD EXEC
Alright soOK we’ve got this
Avril Levigne project FEMME DU
NORD If we’re going to make a
move on it we need to do it
soon So who thinks what

Garrett can’t believe his ears - they’re considering it A
FAT EXEC chimes in

FAT EXEC
I think this project has
tremendous potential Good
action good writing and this
Avril kid really seems like she’s
something

GARRETT (0S)
You are fucking KIDDING me

Shocked out of their pants everyone looks back at Garrett

GARRETT (CONTD)
Don’t look at me like I’ve got
five heads You can’t really
think this has any potential at
all

FAT EXEC
Um excuse me but kids love
Avril Levigne

GARRETT
Everyone hates Avril Levigne
And who cares even if they did

It’s a spy thriller
(MORE )

GARRETT (CONTD)
I use the term “thriller”
loosely because the script
sucks but no Avril Levigne fan
is the target market for this
shit

The Head Exec looks at him like he’s going to say
something Garrett stands up and cuts him off

GARRETT (CONTD)
Ah save it I know you read my
notes on this You read all the
notes even from the peons If
there’s actually a serious
discussion as to whether or not
this should get made anywhere
let alone here I’m just going to
go vomit on a plate because
youll buy that shit too And
then I’1l be rich

He looks down at Will who looks like he really really
wants to laugh and bolts the room

INT GARRETT’S OFFICE - LATER

Garrett’s packing up everything he has Will shows up at
the doorway

WILL
I’m not really wild about getting
another assistant

GARRETT
Shouldn’t be too hard to find
someone who wastes all their time
talking to a girlfriend that
hates them

WILL
So starting tomorrow youre
going to help me look for your
replacement

GARRETT
Oh we meeting people at In ‘N
Out I don’t think they’re going
to let me back in the building

WILL
Youd be surprised

Just then an IT GUY comes walking into the office He
starts shutting down Garrett’s computer
GARRETT
Excuse me resident hacker but I
have files I need to get off of
there before I leave

IT GUY
Oh well I’1l have this set up
in your office in ten minutes
can you do it then I have to
move another computer up here by

three

GARRETT
The fuck you talking about my
office

IT GUY

You got moved down the hall
Congrats by the way They
haven’t promoted anyone in like
three years

And then it sinks in He’s not fired He’s promoted

looks at Will

GARRETT
If you’re fucking with me I swear
to God I will run over there and
kick you in the balls

Will walks up puts his hand on Garrett’s shoulder

WILL
(huge grin)
You ever notice you can’t get up
the courage to do anything unless
youre prodded into it

He smacks him on the cheek twice and walks into his own

office Garrett stands there stunned

INT GARRETT’S CAR - NIGHT

The driver’s side door opens and Garrett gets in dialing
his phone He waits as it rings We hear someone pick up

on the other end

ERIN (0S)
(through phone quiet)

ERIN (0S)
(through phone)
Everything OK

ERIN (0S)
(through phone)

GARRETT

Despite herself despite the fight they just had the night
before we hear Erin screaming happily through the phone

ERIN (0S)
(through phone)

that overwhelms Garrett and his eyes well up He’s
starting to cry

GARRETT
(through tears)
Me too Can we justcan you

ERIN (0S)
(through phone)
Oh baby Of course we can We

And whatever stress he has inside him Garrett lets go
BEGIN LAST MONTAGE SEQUENCE

--Garrett in another story meeting He seems to be
pitching something and he’s rather impassioned He
finishes with a flourish The rest of the room looks
around at each otherand then they all shake their heads
unimpressed Where once Garrett might have thrown a fit
he just nods his head and we can tell his disappointed but
he’s not going to let it bother him

--Garrett eats Thanksgiving dinner in a bar with Dan and
Box They’re laughing and drunk as shit They’re happy

--Erin eats Thanksgiving dinner with Corinne Phil and
their FAMILY It’s all smiles and good vibes They’re

happy

--In the teacher’s lounge we can just see Erin and Damon’s
heads sticking up over the tops of newspapers as they read
Simultaneously she reaches a coffee mug over towards him
as he swings a pot of coffee around neither of them ever
averting their gaze from their newspaper It’s become
their routine

--At a restaurant Garrett and Brianna have a lively and
spirited but friendly debate about a movie or an actor or a
director or a writer It’s clear they have their own
routine

--In his office Garrett’s on the phone with an agent going
over the details of some project As he’s talking an IM
from Erin pops up on the screen I MISS YOU (

Without missing a beat on the phone Garrett swings over to
his desk and types back I MISS YOU TOO - ONLY A FEW MORE
WEEKS BY THE WAY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THE
TEACHER’S LOUNGE )

He smiles and goes back to his phone call

--Erin walks down to the lounge and finds a GIGANTIC vase
full of red and white roses there All the female teachers
feign jealousy

--Erin and Corinne walk into the gynocologist’s office
Erin looks nervous

--Garrett works late into the night in his office sending
emails and typing notes

--Garrett hops into a cab at his apartment Later he’s on
his way when he looks out the window He notices
something then signals to the driver to turn around and go
back

INT PAWN SHOP - DAY

An overhead view of the counter in the pawn shop Across
it gently slides the crystal bear with the red bow on it
led by Garrett’s hand When he comes into view he’s
beaming from ear to ear

INT MIDWAY AIRPORT - NIGHT

Garrett’s headed off the plane and into the terminal when
he hears his cell phone ringing It’s Erin He picks it

up

GARRETT

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - SAME

Erin is curled up in a ball in her bed under the covers
bawling

ERIN

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

GARRETT
What’s wrong

ERIN
(sobbing)

GARRETT
I know I thought you’d call but
when you didn’t I thought I
shouldn’t bother you Does it
hurt

ERIN
Yes It’s the most awthe most
awful thing I’ve ever gone
through It feels like they put
my vagina in the freezer and then
hit it with a hammer

Garrett can’t help but crack a little bit of a smile
She’s unbelievably cute when she’s sad

GARRETT
I’m gonna be there soon OK
Ill grab a cab

ERIN
No I sent Corrine to get you

Not great news

GARRETT
That’s great That’s perfect
I’‘ll see you in an hour I love
you

ERIN
I love youuuuuuuuu tooo0000000

She hangs up he hangs up

INT CORINNE’S CAR - LATER

It’s kind of uncomfortable Corinne more or less refuses
to look at Garrett

GARRETT
So this thing she had done

CORINNE
You could have called You
SHOULD have called

A few moments of silence

GARRETT
I know

Not what she was expecting to hear It softens her a bit
All in one breath

CORINNE

(totally rehearsed)
What Erin had done was a
procedure that’s common among all
women across a broad spectrum of
ages and ethnicities About
three in five women will require
the procedure at some point in
their lives In it the doctor
uses cryonic freezing technology
to isolate and destroy abnormal
cells that may be deemed
suspicious and potentially
damaging to overall cervical
health even on a low-risk scale

She sucks in much-needed wind

GARRETT
So they froze up her lady parts

CORINNE
Immature Yes

GARRETT
How long did it take you to
memorize from a pamphlet

CORINNE
All afternoon
GARRETT
Is that pamphlet currently
located in the glove compartment

CORINNE
It is

GARRETT
May I

CORINNE
You may

He opens the glove compartment pulls out a pamphlet
dealing with the specifics of the procedure and starts
reading

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - LATER

It’s dark as Garrett opens the door and walks in

GARRETT
You up
ERIN
I think so
GARRETT

Is it OK if I turn on a light

ERIN
Maybe

He does She slowly sits up on the bed Her face is PUFFY
from crying Garrett smiles

GARRETT
Hi I’m Garrett from the Make-A-
Wish Foundation Aren’t you just
the cutest little chemo patient

Luckily (or perhaps sadly depending on your view of the
world and this story) this makes her laugh And then she
goes back to crying

GARRETT (CONT’D)
Is there anything I can do for
you Get you

ERIN
(sobbing)
Yes

GARRETT
What’s that
ERIN
(sobbing)
You can make black sludge stop
sliding out of my insides

GARRETT
The pamphlet didn’t mention that

She cries harder Garrett again unable to suppress a
small smile holds her hand and pulls her in close She
hugs him as tightly as she possibily can Muffled because
her face is smashed into his chest

ERIN
(voice breaking)
I’m defrosting

She cries he laughs and they hold each other After a

moment she leans back and grabs a bottle of Coke off her
bedside table She takes a big swig then holds it out

offering him some He waves it off

GARRETT
No no I’ve got to be back to
work in six days Don’t need to
go catching a frozen vagina

That makes her laugh Hard But this hurts her vagina so
she frowns

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

It’s the next morning Erin is in front of her mirror
getting dressed looking less the worse for wear Garrett

opens the door and comes in from the bathroom

GARRETT
You look better

ERIN
I’m still leaking God it’s
gross

GARRETT

Here’s the thing I know you are
and I believe that it is So
that in mind we REALLY don’t
have to talk about it anymore

Erin manages a small but explosive laugh

ERIN
Youre right sorry

GARRETT
S’OK

Garrett reaches down and fishes around in his bag for
something when his hand hits a box

GARRETT (CONTD)
Babe Come sit on the bed with
me for a second

ERIN
Sure

She finishes primping and sits down with him on the corner
of the bed He produces the box

GARRETT
Merry Christmas

ERIN
Presents

As she opens the box and begins to take the paper stuffing
out he starts into a little speech He’s nervous and he
can’t look right at her so his gaze goes from down at the
floor to any other place in the room

GARRETT
So I was thinking the thing you
told me about your dad and the
thing that happened to my
parents and I thought

She finally gets the bear out of the box and handles it
almost with awe

ERIN
Oh Garrett

Her eyes well up and her reaction is an immediate mixture
of gratitudeand shock

GARRETT
Yeah see what I was thinking
was

As he’s trying to find the words he happens to look over
her shoulder for the first time right to her bedside
table next to the empty Coke bottle Sitting there is a
crystal bear that’s almost exactly the same but bigger and
with a blue bow around the neck not a red one

Breaking her gaze from Garrett’s bear she looks back to
the one on her bedside table

GARRETT (CONTD)
Oh

And that’s all he gets out
ERIN
Yeah UmDamon got that for
me He gave it to me at the end
of the last day of school

GARRETT
(utterly irrevocably
crushed)
Oh

ERIN
No seeahhhhhhhhhh Here’s
the thing All the teachers from
school went out to dinner the
other night and he was walking
me back to my car and we passed
this shop and I looked in the
window and saw it and remarked
that it was cute And then
before I left on Thursday he
brought it in and gave it to me

Garrett tries not to die inside tries to be sincere

GARRETT
That wasreally good of him
He’s got great taste in Christmas
gifts obviously

ERIN
Umit was more of a
congratulations gift I think

GARRETT
Congratulations

ERIN
Yeah I’m not getting fired I
get to keep my job I forget to
tell you because of the
procedure They kept Mr Marsh
who’s tenured and me the one
who makes the least money

She tries to smile and we can tell she’s happybut her
heart’s not in it Again Garrett does his best

GARRETT
That’s great babe Now you
don’t have to worry

Seemingly stricken remembering Garrett’s bear in her hand
her eyes well up again

ERIN
But Gare this onethis is the
one that my dad

(MORE)
ERIN (CONTD)
(tries to rein it in)
This is much better than

GARRETT
Babe It’s OK It’s OK
Really I had my chances

He smiles a weak smile He’s not just talking about the
bear

INT ERIN’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY

Erin and Garrett arrive at her MOM’S warm inviting house
for

Christmas dinner Garrett is wearing a garish overly-
festive Christmas-colored Cosby sweater for the occasion
It’s a big hit with Erin’s rather large FAMILY the members
of whom welcome him happily

AT DINNER

Garrett cracks jokes while everyone passes around plates of
food Erin sitting next to him laughs to the point of
convulsions We see that her hand rests on his leg
comfortably the entire time When he’s done passing
plates his hand joins hers

AFTER DINNER

The two sit on a couch in the living room Erin rubbing her
stomach her head in Garrett’s lap him rubbing her head
They’re watching A CHRISTMAS STORY

EXT SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT

Garrett and Erin walk arm in arm down the street

Judging by their breath it’s freezing cold and they’re
huddling as much to keep warm as to be near one another
They don’t seem to be talking just enjoying the night At
one point Erin gets on her tip toes and kisses him on the
cheek

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
The two are in bed kissing Erin pulls back

ERIN
You know I can’tI
can’’tbecause of the thing

GARRETT
I know It’s OK
(off her look)
Really It’s OK

He means it and she can tell he means it
EXT MIDWAY AIRPORT - DAY
We see Erin’s car pull into a parking structure at the

airport

INT ERIN’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

Erin’s car pulls into a parking space

GARRETT
Do I not rate for curbside
service

ERIN

I want to come in with you

And with that she’s out of the car

INT MIDWAY AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER

Garrett with all his bags walks in through the automatic
doors with Erin behind him The airport is crowded as
hell After a few seconds he turns around to face her

GARRETT
Well

And that’s all he gets out Looking at her he’s about to
lose it And he knows he’s about to lose it And she
knows he’s about to lose it So he does the obvious thing
he turns and starts walking away

ERIN
Garrett

In a near panic he finds an unoccupied bench - not just a
small bit of luck - and sits down Erin sits down next to
him After a few seconds of holding his head in his hands
he looks up at her He’s officially losing his shit

This time it’s Erin that calms him

ERIN (CONTD)
Garrett

GARRETT
Yeah

ERIN
When you gave me the bear you
were trying to say something
What were you going to say

It’s all Garrett can do to collect himself but he steels
knowing he has to

GARRETT
It was nothing really I was
just going to say that even
though your dad lost his head and
my parents should be alternates
for JERRY SPRINGER that doesn’t
mean that we can’t be different
It doesn’t mean that we have to
end up like them I mean that’s
the most simple concept in the
world I don’t know why it took
me so long to get that through my
thick skull

ERIN
Yeah

GARRETT
Yeah And yet here we are
Ending up like them

She looks over at him Now she’s losing her shit

ERIN
This is really it isn’t it

Garrett can barely look at her The tears are coming And
then all of a sudden he busts out laughing

ERIN (CONTD)
What

GARRETT
Wow the two of us We are
SOMETHING

ERIN
How so

GARRETT
Declaring our love for one
another in an airport Breaking
upin an airport Thatthat
is a cliched joke of absolutely
cosmic proportions We should be
a bad movie

Erin’s really crying now but all the same she’s holding
it together

ERIN
I don’t feel likeit doesn’t
feel like we don’t love each
other enough does it
Garrett takes her hand

GARRETT
God babe no You knowyou
know what was so great about this
week

She sniffles and looks at him obviously the filmic
equivalent of asking “What”

GARRETT (CONTD)
It was great because there was no
pressure Because we knew it was
over Because you weren’t
thinking about me leaving and
when the next time we were going
to see each other was Because
we weren’t already planning the
next visit before I even left
Because we weren’t hurting when
we should have been doing
anything but hurting We
justwere

A few beats while they consider this

GARRETT (CONT’D)
Don’t love each other enough
Look how hard we tried We made
ourselves miserable No we love
each other way too much to put
ourselves through the torture

And just as the floodgates are about to open for Erin she
makes herself stop Yep she’s holding her breath

GARRETT (CONTD)

Babe
Holding
GARRETT (CONTD)
Erin
Holding
GARRETT (CONTD)
Are you holding your breath
Yes

GARRETT (CONTD)
Aw babe we’re not back to that
are we

Immediately she breathes and the dam breaks
ERIN
(through big ol’ sobs)
N-n-n-n-o I’m just fu-fu-fu-
fucking with you

And she reaches out and hugs him As we pull back through
the airport they become just two people holding onto each
other in a sea of travelers too hurried and self-absorbed
to notice

EXT LAX - NIGHT

Garrett stands in the inner loop of the arrivals area
staring off into the distance After a few seconds a car
pulls up Garrett opens up the back door throws his bags
in and gets in the front seat

INT DAN’S CAR - SAME

It’s Dan He looks at his buddy Looks like he knows
what’s happened

DAN
Youre not going to cry in my
car are you

GARRETT
Nah

Dan pulls away

INT APARTMENT —- LATER

Dan and Garrett walk in flip on the lights Garrett walks
back to his room and as he passes Dan’s room he sees
there’s a rather large hole in the middle of his door He
keeps walking into his room

INT GARRETT’S BEDROOM - SAME

He tosses his bags on the floor and flips on the light
Immediately he sees something out of the corner of his
eye There’s a gigantic bulge underneath the covers of his
bed Garrett walks over and flips them off

Sitting there waiting for him is an ENORMOUS blow-up
penis roughly the size of a normal man

Garrett looks over to his doorway Dan is standing there
half-smiling

GARRETT
Your handywork
Dan nods

GARRETT (CONTD)
You blew it up yourself

Dan nods

GARRETT (CONTD)
And you did it too fast deprived
yourself of oxygen then tried to
stumble to your room blacked
out and put your head through
your door

Dan nods

DAN
I ordered you a hooker Online

GARRETT
Not necessary

DAN
Duly noted I will cancel
Should we go get drunk for no
reason

GARRETT
Absolutely

They walk out of his room
FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT ERIN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Erin comes walking into her bedroom cute boy shorts and
tank top on She walks right past her bedthat Damon is
in halfway under the covers reading a book

Erin bustles over to the window-unit air conditioner
cranking it up

ERIN
Seriously it’s 1130 how is it
so fucking hot

DAMON
Gee I dunno middle of July in
Chicago

ERIN
That’s enough out of you
DAMON
Coming to bed

ERIN

She finishes fiddling with the air conditioner walks over
to the bed Gets under the covers starts taking out her
earrings As she sets them on the bedside table we see

The little crystal bear with the red bow
She sets her earrings down notices it too There’s a
smudge on the ear With a lick of her finger she tries to
buff it off As she’s working Damon puts him arm around
her kisses her shoulder Looks at what she’s doing
DAMON
Thought the one I got you had a
blue bow on it

Not missing a beat

ERIN
Nope

She finishes buffing it content Damon turns over puts
his book on the ground

DAMON
Thought it was a little bigger
too
She looks right at it remembering
ERIN
Nope It’s the same it’s always
been

She smiles As she clicks off the light
