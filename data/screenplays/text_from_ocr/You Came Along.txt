Juliua automatically puts his own hand out Matt stops
just short of the desk his hand not quite close enough
Julius ia already in the motion and haa to awkwardly rise
to lean forward and grasp his hand Both shake firmly but

briefly and Julius drops back into his chair as Matt takes
the chair facing hin

MATT

Matt abruptly stands He paces slowly in front of the deak
Julius watches him warter

MATT
You know I used to be a violent
guy dut then I learned most of
the time violence doesnt help
Most of the time violence makes
it worse But every once in a
while violence is the only thing
a that will do the job

Matt moves quickly around the desk Startled Julius
lunges for his phone Before he gets to it Matt chops
down edge of the hand into the corner where Julius ”
throat and shoulder meet Julius jerks backward paralyzed

by pain staring Matt moves the telephone farther away
atands over Julius

MATT
Its amazing really how much pain
the body can take and not show a
thing This for instance

Stepping to the side hand rigid he gives a short hard
jab into Juliuss kidney Julius arches his back eyes
bulging mouth open in a silent scream Matt considers
hin nods his approval goes back to sit down

MATT
Youll be able to talk in a minute
or two While were waiting let
me explain the situation What

Matt leaves Juliuss eyes on him Julius leans forward
pressing both forearms on the desk easing some of the
pain He breathes 4 bit looking at the phone then
reaches for the phone and the movement gives him a new
spaam Shocked he pulls the arm back His breathing is
More ragged hes staring then he calms down He locks at
the phone the desk the phone the desk He hates it

but he knows he isnt going to make the call Moving
cautiously he draws the printout closer leana over it
determinedly goes on with his reading

They sit a distance apart haif-turned toward each other

MATT
Let me just tell you the situation

EXT 163RD ROW - DAY

Five years ago The street 13 the same except that the
buildings at 45 and 47 are different 45 1a a somewhat
older apartmant building the same size aa the one there
now 47 1s a wreck of a building with concrete block
covering the door and windows on the lower floors broken
giass above a prominent FOR SALE sign nailed to the
front Matt dreased as in the scene with his father

crosses the street moving AWAY from CAMERA and enters
the dark vestibule at 45

MATT (VO)
I came here once five years ago
My father lived in forty-five The
place next to it forty-seven was
and complete wreck

INT BREAKFAST ROOM - NIGHT

MATT
My father and me we werent ever
very close so okay this is the
first time I come to see him since
then No phone calla no letters
He isnt there Okay I can accept
that he moved away Maybe he died
Ill go look see what I can find
out but Im stopped before r start
becanduse every goddam body in this
neighborhood awears that building
thats there now was there five years
go and it wasnt

JANINE
But why would anybody gay that
It doesnt make any sense

MATT

The minute I got here two guys in
the deli wanted to fight with me
because I said those were new
buildings Thats crazy I got
cops following me around leaning
on me telling me to go away get
out of the precinct The barman
down at Daves -- on the corner
-- just told me to move away he
wont serve me any more

(holds up paperbag)
I got a sandwich and coffee at the
deli I think the only reason they
dont tell me get lost ta they
dont speak English
JANINE
What are you going to do Are
you going away

MATT
I cant I got to have an anawer
That™s it Nothing else

JANINE
You went to see the building owmer
today didnt you pid you find him

MATT
(ironic) ‘
Oh yeah I found him

JANINE
He couldnt give you any answers

MATT
He wouldnt even listen to the
question Theres some kind of
election coming up somebody
running for mayor thats all
this fellow Oberman wants to think
about But he gave me more things
to think about

JANINE
He did

MATT

I finally found something that
belonged to my father and hes

got it Oberman in his office
How does that happen I think
okay maybe my father died in the
apartment when theyre cleaning it
out for another tenant they find

the picture he likes it takes it
for himself

JANINE
Picture

MATT
An o11 painting of my mother My
father paid for 1t one time when he
thought he was flush My mother
died when I was a kid so thats what
we had of her The beautiful lady up
On the wall And now its on
Obermans wall

JANINE
Did you ask him about it

MATT

I told you he didnt want to be
asked about anything But if it
was as simple as that if its

just my father died in the apartment
and thats why Obermans got the
picture why doesnt somebody

say 307 Oh sure Eugene Bulley
died three years ago heart attack
stroke whatever Why have a whole
community telling lies about a

uilding why have everybody leaning

on me to go away

JANINE
It doesnt make sense I know youre
sure of the address and everything--

MATT
j Im sure And Im sure about that
picture Thats the only mother I
ever had Im not gonna forget what
-— it looked like S0 I could be stupid
and mistaken and crazy a hundred
different ways but theres atill a
link of some kind between my father
and Alec Oberman and the picture
proves it

JANINE
So you want to find out what the
link is

MATT

Yes Is there any way out of here
except the front door

He takes hia coffee out of the paperbag starts to drink it
She smiles at him understanding

JANINE

You want to avoid the police

wrong building Would the papers
like that Would the local TV news
And two weeks before the election
The debris even got held up by a
rally for your guy

the point And I know what you did
to keep it out of the papers and
off the TV You cleared the whole
thing off in one day You paid off

five found them new places to live
furniture clothes You bought off
anybody in the neighborhood that
might have a big mouth It wasnt
Manhattan it was just a little outer
borough neighborhood nobody ever
looks at so you could make it work
Nobody ever knew But why does
everybody say the buildings are
twelve years old What difference
does it make

OBERMAN

request 4 new certificate of ocoupancy
because we nad no building permits
nothing no right to put the building
up So we had to pretend it was the

old building with the old certificate
of occupancy
