DRIVING MISS DAISY

FADE IN
INT DAISYS BEDROOM - DAY AUGUST 1948

A precise orderly room Comfortable and well maintained but
not fancy or trendy Venetian blinds are drawn against the
hot August sun The room seems to be in repose Suddenly the
face of DAISY WERTHAN appears looking directly at us She
straightens the straw hat on her head We realize we have
been looking at a mirror image of the room

Daisy is seventy-two years old and apparently in excellent
health She wears a summer street dress low-heeled white
shoes and appropriate summer jewelry -- no makeup

She does not dwell on her mirror image once the hat is
adjusted She reaches into a bureau drawer takes out a pair
of white gloves gets her pocket book from the closet and
walks purposefully out of the room

A SERIES OF SHOTS
A Daisy in the upstairs hall
B Daisy walking down the carpeted steps

c Daisy in the downstairs hall which contains a commode
with a 1930s telephone on it and various objets dart

D Daisy in the dining room drapes closed against the hot
sunlight

E Daisy through the swinging door in the pantry

She moves briskly through the silent rooms This is a woman
who is never idle Everything about her suggests energy and
purpose What we see of her house tells us that she is in
comfortable circumstances Bookshelves are evident in many of
the rooms The furniture is overstuffed andor mahogany

INT THE KITCHEN - DAY

A spacious black-and-white tiled kitchen -- pre-WWI in
dimension The only sign of the times is a fairly modern gas
range

IDELLA black and close to Daisys age stands at the sink
under the window polishing silver with an old toothbrush
She does not look up or in any way acknowledge Daisys
entrance into the kitchen
Daisy removes a shopping list from a cabinet drawer

DAISY
Im gone to the market Idella

IDELLA
Mmmmmm

Daisy heads out the door

EXT THE BACK YARD - DAY

Bright hot sunlight the yard shimmering in the morning heat
We can SEE the outside of the house now -- Georgian built in
the teens comfortable but not pretentious Green canvas
awnings protect the house from the sun

DAISY walks to the garage a separate building built for two
ears but only holding one -- a shiny new 1948 Packard She
climbs into the car

A SERIES OF SHOTS

A Daisys gloved hand turns on the ignition

B Her POV Shifting the automatic gear into reverse

Cc Her high-heeled foot pushing the accelerator

D On the car backing out of the garage and into the
turnaround

E On Daisy gloved hands both clutching the wheel back
straight not touching the seat

F On the gear indicator still in reverse
G On Daisys foot gunning the accelerator

I On the car shooting backwards over an embankment
seemingly suspended in the air for a moment before it lands on
the roof of the garage next door (down the hill) causing the
garage to collapse which in turn lands on the free-standing
toolshed just adjacent to it which also falls into pieces
seattering garden tools etc in all directions The NOISE
is deafening

J On Idella looking out of the kitchen window in horror

IDELLA
Sweet Jesus

H On a nursemaid and a toddler coming out of the house next
door
EXT THE GARAGE - SAME TIME

Daisys severely damaged car sits in (on) whats left of the
garage All is still

ON DAISY

Still in the car still clutching the wheel with gloved hands
Her hat is crooked and her glasses are askew but otherwise
she is unhurt She tests the door handle It works She
pushes the door open extracts her purse from the car and gets
out

EXT THE NEIGHBORS GARAGE - DAY

Whats left of Daisys car rises in the air ghost-like

PULL BACK reveals that the car is being hoisted by a tow truck
and a gigantic chain and pulley operation Whats left of the
garage collapses like pick-up sticks

BOOLIE WERTHAN Daisys son age 40 stands with a policeman
and insurance agent in the yard He wears a good summer
business suit A sizable part of the neighborhood black
servants children yard men etc stand silently at a
respectful distance watching the proceedings

ON BOOLIE
He looks up the hill towards his mothers house
BOOLIES POV - DAISYS HOUSE

Daisy is watching from her bedroom window but moves quickly
out of the way when Boolie catches her eyes

ON THE NEIGHBORS YARD AGAIN

The pulley operation sets the remains of the car at rest The
reverberations of this knock down whats left of the toolshed

ON THE CROWD watching silently
INT DAISYS KITCHEN - SAME DAY

Idella is sitting on a stool eating fried chicken and potato
salad at the kitchen counter Boolie is seated at the kitchen
table finishing off a plate of same Each has a glass of ice
tea and a paper napkin but Idellas plate is a cracked
remnant of an old pattern her fork is from the dime store
and her tea is in a small mason jar Boolie is eating off of
Daisys everyday china and silver Daisy is not in the room
but a THUMPING and CLUMPING 0S indicate that she is within
earshot
BOOLIE
Mama

DAISY (0S)
No

BOOLIE
Mama

DAISY (0S)
No

BOOLIE
Its a miracle youre not laying
in Emory Hospital -- or decked out
at the funeral parlor

He rises from the table and heads for
THE PANTRY

Daisy is in the pantry closet having changed out of her
street clothes into a house dress She is kneeling on the
floor by a large pickle crock removing the lid the rock that
holds down a plate which in turn holds down the pickles in
their brine She maneuvers the crock out of the closet and
toward the pantry sink waving away Boolies efforts to help
her

Once at the sink she begins the operation of spearing pickles
that are already lined up by the sink and then ladling brine
into the jars and screwing on the jar tops This operation
keeps her busy during the following scene She spears the
first pickle out of the crock and hands it to Boolie who
takes a bite

DAISY
The cucumbers are pretty this
summer

BOOLIE

Look at you You didnt even
break your glasses

DAISY
It was the cars fault’

BOOLIE
Mama you had the car in the
wrong gear
DAISY

(calls to Idella)
Idella You want a pickle with

IDELLA (0S)

DAISY

to take home to William you hear

IDELLA (0S)
Yassum Thank you He love your
pickles

DAISY
Thats because he has more sense
than you do

BOOLIE
You had the car in reverse instead
of drive The police report shows
that

DAISY
You should have let me keep my
LaSalle It never ‘would have
behaved this way

BOOLIE
Mama cars dont behave They are
behaved upon The fact is you
all by yourself demolished that
Packard

DAISY
Think what you want I know the
truth

BOOLIE
The truth is you just cost the
insurance company twenty-seven
hundred dollars You are a
terrible risk Nobody is going
to issue you a policy after this

DAISY
Youre just saying that to be
hateful
BOOLIE
Okay Yes Yes I am Im making
it all up Every insurance company
in America is lined up out there in
the driveway waving their fountain

pens and falling all over themselves

to get you to sign on

DAISY
I love having you here for lunch
son but if youre going to stand
in my pantry and lie like a rug
well I think its time for you
to go somewhere else

BOOLIE
Okay Id better get back to the
office Florinell be having a fit
if I dont come home on time tonight

DAISY
Thats right I forgot Yall are
having dinner with the Ansleys

another new dress This is her
idea of heaven on earth isnt it

BOOLIE

BOOLIE

BOOLIE

serious talking to do

DAISY
No

BOOLIE
Mama
DAISY

(singing to end

discussion)
After the ball is over
After the break of morn
After the dancers leaving
After the stars are gone
Many a heart is aching
If you could read them all --

As soon as she starts singing Daisy having finished her
pickle business turns on her heels and walks out of the
pantry We HEAR her SINGING continue and FADE as she climbs
the stairs and eventually shuts the door to her room

Boolie having lost this round picks up the largest mason jar
of pickles to take home

INT THE TEMPLE - SAME DAY

We are in the large sanctuary of the Temple the Atlanta
Reform Jewish Congregation The building was designed in the
twenties and somehow this sanctuary carries a sense of the
Bible as interpreted by CB DeMille The room has a very
large chandelier lots of large windows and is decorated with
white walls and gold relief work The Are for the Torah
itself is all gold relief work The whole place gives off a
scent of well-being and not too much religious warmth

We are approaching the end of the Saturday morning service
The RABBI who prefers to call himself DR WEIL is conducting
the service in a morning coat There are no yarmulkes or any
other Jewish paraphernalia in sight

The sanctuary is sparsely populated this (and every) Saturday
morning In the front couple of rows sit the Confirmation
Class some thirty or so tenth-graders who have to appear
every Saturday in order to get confirmed at the end of the
year

They are standard issue high school sophomores dressed well
and appropriately for a religious service None of them seem
very interested in the service Some look just plain bored
others are miles away and still others (girls) are passing
notes andor giggling

Most of the rest of the room is empty There are a few
worshippers in pairs or alone scattered throughout
The last few rows are more populated Here are the older
members of the congregation mostly widows some older men
and a few grown sonsdaughters Daisy is in the next to the
last row sitting very straight in the pew her back not
touching the seat

DR WEIL
‘Praised and glorified be the name of
the Holy One though He be above all
the praises which we can utter Our
guide is He in life and our redeemer
through all eternity

CONGREGATION
Our help cometh from Him the Creator
of heaven and earth

DR WEIL
The departed whom we now remember have
entered into the peace of life eternal
They still live on earth in the acts of
goodness they performed and in the
hearts of those who cherish their memory
May the beauty of their life abide among
us as a loving benediction

CONGREGATION
Amen

DR WEIL
May the Father of peace send peace to
all who mourn and comfort the bereaved

among us
CONGREGATION
Amen
The CHOIR 0S now SINGS
CHOIR

May the words of my mouth

And the meditations of my heart

Be acceptable in Thy sight O Lord
My strength and my redeemer

Amen Amen Amen

EXT CREST CEMETERY - DAY - MAY 1951

A full fuzzy-green warm morning Although this is a
cemetery it is not depressing -- not today anyway in the
bright sunlight The red-clay Georgia soil looks particularly
soft

Daisys car is parked off to the side of one of the narrow
roadways The car is not quite so new now but still well-
kept Hoke is carefully buffing the front grillwork with his
trusty old chamois cloth We can SEE the Georgia license
plate which reads 1951 so a couple of years have passed since
the last scene

Twenty feet or so from him Daisy is kneeling by a well-tended
grave The headstone reads WERTHAN” The small stone at the
foot on one side reads Sigmund Werthan with his dates The
other side is unused Daisy is digging with her trowel
planting verbena Hoke ambles over

HOKE

EXT THE CEMETERY - SAME TIME

We FOLLOW HOKE on his walk past the weeping cherry tree
carrying the potted azalea in front of him He is cautious
but excited The headstones loom in front of him somehow
suddenly menacing But he proceeds And sure enough there
it is -- BAUER

He silently mouths the Buh and the Er and places the azaleas
gently in front of the headstone A big moment for him
Then walking quickly he heads back to where Daisy is
finishing up her digging and collecting her things

HOKE
Miz Daisy

DAISY
Yes

HOKE

DAISY

decorators idea of an English club The mantelpiece and
mirror above it are currently supporting a large display of
christmas cards One of them reads in bold letters So Long
1953

Boolie wearing a long-sleeved cashmere pullover and an open
shirt is going through a pile of long-playing Christmas
records His cabinet hi-fidelity record player is the very
latest thing circa 1953 ‘The record jackets we see are
albums by Bing Crosby Rosemary Clooney Hugo Winterhalter
etc none of them particularly religious in content Through
the open double doors we can just glimpse a portion of a huge
floor-to-ceiling Christmas tree and a mound of wrapped
presents at the base

OS we HEAR Florines inimitable VOICE

An early fifties dream of a kitchen newly appointed Every
surface contains the makings of a Christmas party-to-be A
large baked ham unsliced various bottles of liquor makings
for canapes ete etc The current bone of contention is a
large cut glass bowl full of sliced oranges and bananas
Florine in slacks and a silk blouse peers into the bowl

INT AUBURN AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH THE SANCTUARY - DAY

This is a fairly small church humble in contrast to Daisys
Temple we have seen earlier The sanctuary is about half-
filled at the moment A funeral is in progress

A BLACK CHOIR MEMBER - A TEEN-AGED GIRL with a particularly
strong voice is singing What a Friend we Have in Jesus
She wears a choir robe She is standing with the rest of the
choir but this is the solo part of the service

A MINISTER also black and also robed stands nearby just
behind a simple coffin

A SHOT OF THE SANCTUARY reveals that the entire population is
black except for three white people in the rear -- Daisy
Boolie and Florine Hoke is sitting in the pew with them on
the aisle next to Boolie Everyone in the congregation holds
a printed program of events

ON THE THREE WHITE FACES a part of the service but not a
part Florine wears a stylish suit Daisy has on a black hat
with a veil She looks straight ahead at the singer her face
showing no emotion Only Hokes face expresses his feelings
as the four watch the solemn proceedings

INT DAISYS HOUSE THE KITCHEN - DAY - JULY SAME YEAR

For the first time the kitchen looks a bit out of date a bit
shabby The linoleum is clean but a little chipped and
scruffy An electric fry pan sits on one of the counters
clearly a concession to Boolie because it is shiny new and
obviously never used -

Daisy is frying chicken in a large black cast iron skillet
The cut-up chicken is on the counter as is the paper bag full
of flour She shakes the chicken in the bag then places it
in the hot oil skillet

Hoke appears behind her watching critically Eventually he
cannot contain himself and speaks

HOKE
You fixin to ruin it

DAISY
What are you talking about

HOKE
You got de skillet turn up too high
and de chicken too close together

DAISY
Mind your business

HOKE

He shrugs walks out of the kitchen Daisy considers a
Moment turns the flame down

EXT DAISYS HOUSE THE YARD - DAY

wheelbarrow

visible The hall is dark Daisy finds what she is looking
for a stumpy old white candle She shuts the drawer gets
up and we FOLLOW HER through

THE KITCHEN

somewhat lighter because of the windows She lights the
candle with kitchen matches drips wax onto a saucer and

firms the candle in place She heads back towards the living
room
tf She walks through the dark HALL We FOLLOW HER into
THE LIVING ROOM

Only a little brighter evidence of ice storm outside The
room seems more cluttered less organized than it was in 1948
And the darkness of the morning only accentuates the somewhat
shabby aura

Daisy goes to sit in her armchair The current National
Geographic is on the table She picks it up and tries to
read but is unsuccessful in the poor light

Suddenly she HEARS the BACK DOOR open and close FOOTSTEPS
She half-rises out of the chair in alarm

DAISY

She hangs up sharply
ON BOOLIE as he hangs up the phone smiling at his wife
EXT STREET - DAY

A traffic jam is in progress Cars standing still HORNS
BLARING irritability in the air It is early fall but hot
and humid

One of the cars in the stalled lane is Daisys Its a car we
havent seen before -- a Cadillac sedan (circa 1960) All of
Daisys cars subsequent to the first Cadillac are virtually
the same -- all Cadillac blue -- but of course Boolie
trades them in every two or three years -- a matter of equity

At the moment Daisy is alone in her car fanning herself with
her handkerchief and out of sorts She is wearing a hat and
gloves

Hoke walking against the traffic reaches Daisys car He is
carrying his jacket He leans into the car

INT DAISYS HOUSE THE FRONT HALL DAY - FALL 1966

Daisy is seated at the telephone table dialing Still the
same old black telephone She dials with some difficulty
Things have become harder for her to do

DAISY
Hidey Miss McClatchey You always
recognize my voice What a shame a
wonderful girl like you never married
Miss McClatchey is my son in Oh
no no no Please dont call him out
of a sales meeting Just give hima
message Tell him I bought the
tickets for the UJA banquet Yes UJA
banquet honoring Martin Luther King on
the seventeenth Well youre a sweet
thing to say so And dont you worry
My cousin Tillie in Chattanooga married

INT DAISYS HOUSE THE KITCHEN - DUSK - SAME DAY

Boolie comes through the back door on his way home from work
The end of the same day The house is quiet

BOOLIE
Mama Where are you

DAISY (0S)
Up here
He follows her voice up the stairs into
HER BEDROOM

Daisy sits at her desk paying bills Her large old-
fashioned checkbook open on her desk and a small stack of
bills neatly stacked and stamped nearby She works
efficiently but slowly because its harder to write now
She continues her work after Boolie comes in

BOOLIE
How are you feeling Mama

DAISY
Not a good question to ask somebody
nearly ninety

BOOLIE
Well you look fine

DAISY
Its my ageless appeal

BOOLIE
Miss McClatchey gave me your message

DAISY
Florine is invited too

BOOLIE
Thank you very much

DAISY
I guess Hoke should drive us
Therell be a crowd

BOOLIE
Mama we have to talk about this

DAISY
Talk about what

BOOLIE
The feasibility of all this

an DAISY
Fine you drive I thought I was
being helpful

BOOLIE
you know I believe Martin Luther
King has done some mighty fine things

DAISY
Boolie if you dont want to go why
dont you just come right out and say

so

BOOLIE
I want to go You know how I feel
about him

DAISY

Of course but Florine --

BOOLIE
Florine has nothing to do with it
I still have to conduct business in
this town

DAISY
I see The Werthan Company will go
out of business if you attend the King
dinner

BOOLIE
Not exactly But a lot of men I do
business with wouldnt like it They
might snicker a little and call me
Martin Luther Werthan behind my back --
something like that And Id begin to
notice that my banking business wasnt
being handled by the top dogs Maybe
I wouldnt hear about certain lunch
meetings at the Commerce Club And
Jack Raphael over at Ideal Press hes
a New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew
and the really smart Jews come from New
York dont they So some of the boys
might start throwing business to Jack
instead of old Martin Luther Werthan
I dont know Maybe it wouldnt happen
but thats the way it works If we
don’t use those seats somebody else
will and the good Dr King will never
know the difference will he

DAISY
If we dont use those seats Im not
supposed to go either

BOOLIE
Mama you can do whatever you want

DAISY
Thanks for your permission
BOOLIE
Can I ask you something When did you
get so fired up about Martin Luther
King Time was Id have heard a
different story

DAISY
Why Boolie Ive never been
prejudiced and you know it

BOOLIE
Okay Why dont you ask Hoke to go
to the dinner with you

DAISY
Hoke Dont be ridiculous He
wouldnt go

BOOLIE
Ask him and see

INT DAISYS HOUSE DAISYS BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

The blinds are up Sun streams into the room The bureau
drawers are open Clothes from the closet are piled on the
bed There is a large cardboard carton half full of things

Florine comes out of Daisys closet She wears what she
considers work clothes Vanderbilt-type jeans and a crisp
cotton shirt She is probably in her early 60s and she
shouldnt be wearing clothes like this but she definitely
still has her figure Her age mostly shows in the amount of
makeup she must resort to and her hair which seems te grow
brighter and more false as she goes along At the moment she
is carrying Daisys old fur neck piece on a hanger She puts
it on and looks in the mirror It is old and scruffy and out
of fashion She laughs at her image and tosses it into the
cardboard box

INT CAR - DAY - NOVEMBER 1973

Hoke 85 years old is seated in the passenger seat of a car
We do not see the driver Hokes glasses have gotten thicker
clsoe to Coke bottle depth now He is wearing an overcoat
over his suit He does not look happy We see that the car
is traveling down a suburban street

The car slows down as it approaches Daisys house

the lawn close to the street Over it has been plastered a
SOLD sign

ON THE CAR a modest early seventies two-door turns up
Daisys driveway -It is driven by a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN

The car comes to a stop A late model Mercedes Benz is parked
in the garage

The woman pats Hokes hand He gets out of the car The
woman looks concerned but Hoke shoos her away and goes in the
back door

INT DAISYS HOUSE THE LIVING ROOM - DAY
