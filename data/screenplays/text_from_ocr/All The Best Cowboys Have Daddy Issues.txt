TEASER

A WHIZBANG RECAP takes us through the intensity of last week’s EPISODE -
- Claire’s FREAK OUT Her insistence that SOMEONE ATTACKED HER

Hurley suggesting a CENSUS to Jack Interviewing ETHAN Claire
claiming she was attacked Jack offering her the sedative -- her
storming OFF Charlie going after her And finally ETHAN confronting
Charlie and Claire on the path --

ETHAN
I know you’re scared It’s okay

CHARLIE
What the hell are you talking about you
git One more step --

AND SUDDENLY a NOISE in the DENSE JUNGLE behind them -- MOVEMENT --
NON-DESCRIPT -- Charlie and Claire both turn towards it -- NOTHING
And the instant they turn back --

Ethan is standing right in front of them --

ETHAN
I’m sorry it’s come to this

And as we CLOSE IN ON ETHAN’S COLD EYES -- wondering who the hell he is
-- what he wants -- and what he is GOING TO DO

SMASH TO BLACK

And just as we begin to catch our breath A FRENETIC ZOOM
through the “O” pushes through the darkness -

HURLEY (0S)
He wasn’t on the plane

- and BLASTS OUT OF JACK’s opening eye at -
INT THE VALLEY - DAY 1
- where he dresses SAYID’s wound as he lies passed-out It

is two seconds since we last saw Jack -- surrounded by KATE
HURLEY and LOCKE

KATE
Who wasn’t on the plane

HURLEY
That Canadian guy - Ethan - He
isn’t in the passenger manifest -
LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204 2
(CONTD) 1

And there is great ENERGY to all this -- OVERLAPPING DIALOGUE
-- CAMERA FLYING AROUND PICKING UP PIECES OF IT -- ALL BOILS
DOWN TO ONE THING -- CONFUSION

JACK HURLEY
Well where is he
-- Don’t know -- I talked to
him yesterday and --

KATE JACK
Jack -- Sayid his leg --
-- Anybody seen Ethan

AS THE CAMERA SPINS PEOPLE COMING TO CHECK THE COMMOTION
WORD OF SAYID’S RETURN - MURMURING - JACK LOUDER NOW HIS
SENSE OF SOMETHING FUCKING TERRIBLE GROWING --

JACK
Has anyone seen Ethan

CAMERA finds MICHAEL --

MICHAEL
Yeah said he was gonna get wood -
took off on the path to the beach
(re Sayid)

Is he okay man What happened --

But Jack’s mind is going a THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR LOOKING
AROUND -- suddenly realizing --

JACK KATE
Where’s Charlie
-- What

JACK
Where’s Charlie

And on that the CAMERA ABRUPTLY STOPS A moment Another
moment And then finally we find someone we haven’t yet
heard from --

LOCKE
He went after Claire

And as the implications of this hit Jack full force we PUSH
IN ON HIM and --

SMASH CUT TO

EXT JUNGLE - PATH TO THE BEACH - DAY 2
JACK runs down the PATH -- LOCKE at his side

We’re MOVING with then CLOSE on the two men as this growing
sense of dread FUELS THEIR SPRINT --

-- AND OTHER THAN THE HARDCORE SOUND OF THEIR BREATH all we
get is the SOUNDS OF THE JUNGLE - birds - trees - the wind -

And LOCKE abruptly STOPS His head turns to the right as
those preternatural EYES focus on something --

LOCKE
Jack

And JACK already ahead comes to a STOP Turns towards us --

EYES QUESTIONING what Locke is looking at

But Locke is already striding through the FOLIAGE Whatever
it is now Jack sees it too

TWENTY YARDS AWAY

And as the two men approach us CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to reveal --

A BAG

Just sitting here surrounded by lush green JUNGLE Oddly
out of place Locke squats down in front of it -- as Jack
makes an awful realization -

JACK
She was moving to the beach

Locke turns to shoot Jack a quizzical look
JACK (CONTD)
(indicating the bag)

Claire It’s hers

Locke nods turns back to the bag Jack is overwhelmed with
guilt -- trying to make sense of this and NOT --

JACK (CONTD)
What -- what happened Where --

LOCKE
I don’t know

And we’re ON LOCKE NOW an EERIE CALM coming over him as he
examines the GROUND around the bag --

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 2

LOCKE (CONT’D)
Footprints - at least three
discrete sets - they’re all over
the place - looks like there might
have been a struggle -

But Locke has found something REALLY INTERESTING NOW on the
periphery of the clearing BENT and BROKEN GRASS He moves
to it suddenly --

JACK
What What is it

LOCKE
Drag marks Here and here

JACK
Charlie -- he came after her They
were together

Locke explains what both of them are thinking and said so
simply it’s all the more TERRIFYING --

LOCKE
I think they’ve been taken

ON JACK Locke’s words freaking him out because he KNOWS
THEYRE TRUE -- Looking around the DARK DENSE JUNGLE They
could have gone anywhere -- FRANTIC -- SHOUTS --

JACK
CLAIRE CHARLIE
(then in another
direction)
CLAIRE

LOCKE
Jack

Jack’s head whips around back on Locke -- And if Jack is
dialed up to TEN Locke is sitting comfortably at ONE --

And as we PUSH IN he carefully brings a raised finger to his
lips --

LOCKE (CONTD)
Shhhhhhhhhhh

CUT TO BLACK

ACT ONE
EXT JUNGLE - PATH TO THE BEACH - DAY 3

ECU on Locke’s hand - picking up a twig - WIDER as Locke
examines a break in the wood --

-- Jack steps up behind him the two men exchange glances
Locke motions for Jack to follow him - the two move down the
path - checking behind and around suspicious that someone
may be watching them -

- Locke finally breaks the silence as he examines a footprint
on the soft earth - but their voices stay quiet furtive -
full of amped-up intensity --

LOCKE
The tracks are still fresh
JACK
It doesn’t make any sense -- How

could one man drag two people --
one of them pregnant

LOCKE
You’re asking the wrong question
Not how
(turns to him)

Why
Jack absorbs this And as there is no answer --

JACK
You think it was Ethan

LOCKE
It certainly feels like it was
Ethan

ON JACK Yeah It does - but the questions still outnumber
the answers -- This is fucking IMPOSSIBLE -- FRUSTRATED --

JACK
By himself How --

LOCKE
We can’t account for all of our
people --
(beat then)
And more importantly who’s to say
they’re even our people

This effectively freezes Jack What the fuck is he

LOCKE (CONT’D)
Sayid said there were others

JACK
(no)
He said “we are not alone”

A beat then --

LOCKE
Semantics
JACK
(refusing to believe this)
Sayid’s injured -- we don’t know
where he went -- he’s delerious
LOCKE

I’m only telling you what the
ground is telling me

JACK
(frustration mounting)
So which way is the ground saying
they went

Locke looks at Jack his tone cautious measured

LOCKE JACK
Jack -- we don’t know whats
going on here
-- We know enough

LOCKE
We need to prepare -- we can be
back at the caves in ten minutes --
organize a search party get
weapons --

JACK
Which way did they go Locke

Locke stares at Jack - practically vibrating with impatience
After a moment Locke simply points into the woods -

- and Jack just takes off in that direction -

AND OFF LOCKE his expression betraying nothing in spite of
having no intention whatsoever of following
LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 4

Jack runs - knocking tree branches aside - propelling himself
as fast as his legs can carry him - and as he does -

JACKS VOICE (PRE-LAP)
Lets get a clamp on that artery so
I can ligate above the tear -

INT HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 5

ECU on Jack mouth and nose covered by a surgical mask eyes
narrowed into slits as he wages war on a mounting crisis

JACK
- come on - come on

WIDEN TO REVEAL a harsh CONTRAST TO THE LUSH JUNGLE -- the
COLD ANTISEPTIC WHITENESS of an OPERATING ROOM

And we’re IN THE SHIT here folks CAMERA once again ON THE
MOVE as we find Jack surrounded by several SURGICAL NURSES
and an ANESTHESIOLOGIST gathered around the OPERATING TABLE
as Jack works an incision in the PATIENT’s abdomen -

ANESTHESIOLOGIST JACK
BP’s falling - she’s
bleeding out -- No - I got the artery -

almost there -

- BLEEEEEEP That sound Instantly recognizable as a heart
monitor’s way of saying the Grim Reaper’s come a-knockin’

JACK (CONTD)
Let’s start CPR

ANESTHESIOLOGIST JACK
She’s in arrest
-- 1 milligram epi - Where’s
that crash cart

Over the WHIRR of defibrillator paddles CHARGING UP a Nurse
(ANDREA) performs CPR as Jack redoubles his efforts -

JACK (CONTD)
Artery’s sealed - close her up -

ANDREA
(holding out the paddles)
D-fib
LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304
(CONTD) 5

- and takes his hands out of the incision grabbing the
paddles without missing a beat -

JACK
CLEAR

- and pushing them into the patient’s chest - KA-THWUM The
Patient JERKS UPWARDS as

BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE -- Monitor still flat-lining Jack’s
head whipping back to his patient --

ANDREA
Were charged -

JACK
Clear

KA-THWUM BEREEEREEEEEEEEEEE

Jack passes off the paddles Instantly begins to administer
CPR himself

JACK (CONTD)
- C’mon -- C’mon back --

More COMPRESSIONS Andrea administering OXYGEN from a
SQUEEZE MASK --

JACK (CONTD)
C’mon Let’s go C’mon back

And that’s when we hear an AUTHORITATIVE VOICE -- weve been
on this action so TIGHT we neglected to register the MAN
standing just five feet behind the table out of the fray --

MAN
Call it

Jack doesn’t stop Keeps PRESSING --

MAN (CONTD)
Call it

Jack ignores the voice --

MAN (CONTD)
Jack

Jack finally turns to face the man --

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304
(CONTD) 5

-- and as the man lowers his mask for those of us who can
remember back to Episode Three we instantly recognize
SHEPHARD Jack’s father

For those of us who DON’T remember we’ll restate their
relationship soon enough

SHEPHARD
It’s over Call it

And Jack just LOOKS at his father A BEAT ANOTHER beat
And finally --

Jack slowly removes his hands from the patient’s chest

Reaches over to the MONITOR FLICKS A SWITCH The
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE abruptly CUTS OFF

Jack exchanges a look with Andrea Her eyes drop

And now he pulls off his OWN MASK Turns back to his
father eyes burning intensely --

JACK
You call it

A stand-off A battle of wills SO FUCKING MUCH GOING ON
HERE -- and we’ll spend the rest of the episode exploring it
But for now Shephard holds his son’s gaze And without
batting an eyelash --

SHEPHARD
Time of death is 323 PM
(beat)
Per the Chief of Surgery

Jack turns from his father to look at this Patient -- His
eyes locked in as he PULLS OFF HIS BLOODY GLOVES - and as we
STAY TIGHT ON HIM --

SMASH CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - DAY 6

Jack PUSHES HIS WAY THROUGH GIANT JUNGLE LEAVES continuing
to run - and the silence of the previous scene is overtaken
by the dull ROAR of the jungle - the look on his face
identical to that seen in the operating room -

- and then a SOUND - and it is the kind of sound that could
be anything The WIND the RUSTLE of trees the HOWL of an
animal - but to Jack - it is a sign to push even harder -

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 6

- and as Jack picks up the pace growing smaller and smaller
as the jungle grows larger and larger around him -

CUT TO

INT THE VALLEY - ENTRANCE - DAY 7

- abuzz with activity - anxiety abounds and all of the
movement in the valley (including the brief clipped pace of
the following scenes) indicates growing unease

KATE enters in mid-argument with Locke -

KATE
You just let him go Alone

LOCKE
Couldn’t stop him Don’t worry --
I’1l catch up
(then)
What’s the word from the beach

KATE
Nothing Nobody’s seen them

Locke nods Of course they haven’t Then --

KATE (CONTD)
I’m coming with you

LOCKE
Figured you might

LOCKE reaches his little area PULLS OPEN his SUITCASE --
loaded with KNIVES Selects the biggest and SHARPEST as we
pick up --

SHANNON (0S)
- What are you doing We need to
get our water and go back to the
beach This isn’t our --

BOONE (0OS)
I heard you’re forming a search
party Can I help

Locke and Kate look up to see BOONE SHANNON on his heels --

SHANNON
Search party This is a deserted
island

SHANNON (CONTD)
No choppers no Amber alert - how
exactly are you going to find them

Locke takes one look at the put-upon expression on Boone’s
face and shuts Shannon down -

LOCKE

By following Ethan’s trail -

(off Shannon’s look)
- no one can walk through
wilderness without leaving signs --
bending blades of grass breaking
twigs -- especially with captives
in tow

Locke extends a KNIFE to Boone --
LOCKE (CONT’D)
And yes I could use another hand

if you’re up for it

Boone takes the knife grateful for the validation

BOONE
I’m up for it
And Locke REGARDS BOONE -- as if for the first time Really
take this kid in Odd Finally
LOCKE

Then let’s get moving

Locke and Kate step past Shannon toward the cave exit - Boone
follows gives his sister a look as he PASSES

And off her DISBELIEF of having been completely FROZEN OUT --
EXT THE VALLEY - ENTRANCE - DAY 8
Michael and WALT walk toward the entrance in mid-argument --
WALT
I could take Vincent you know he
could sniff something that belonged
to Charlie and - I can help

MICHAEL
I said no man

Michael reaches Locke as he stuffs ANOTHER knife into his
VEST falls into step with him as he moves out -- Kate and
Boone lagging behind --

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304
(CONTD) 8

MICHAEL (CONTD)
A lot of us don’t want to just sit
here waiting for news We’re
willing to go out and look too

Locke barely stops to look at Michael -

LOCKE
Thanks but we’re set Anyone else
is just going to slow us down

MICHAEL
Yeah -- Okay -- so maybe I can put
together another party

LOCKE
Good idea We’re going north I
suggest you go south

And with that Locke STRIDES OFF leaving Michael alone

And as Michael looks at Walt aware that he has just gotten
the same kind of dismissal he was giving his son

EXT JUNGLE - CLEARING - DAY 9

ECU on Jack’s hand reaching for a twig then WIDER as he
brings it up to his face trying to read it only to crush
and throw it to the ground frustrated

Out of breath Jack continues to walk looking down - trying
to find ANY SIGN that will tell him where to go -- the sad
truth however is that Jack is lost and alone --

-- but that doesn’t mean he is beaten or resigned Jack
looks up at the sky then after a beat - he turns back to
the ground redoubling his effort to find Ethan’s trail --

MATCH CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 10
- the equally troubled look on Jack’s face as he looks down

at the dead woman on the operating table This is the quiet
after the storm

The nurses and assistants file out Jack places a sheet over
the patient and turns to look at his father and realizes that
the storm is about to begin

SHEPHARD
Never thought I’d see the day

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204 13

(CONTD) 10
Jack says nothing The Old Man approaches - his anger
building

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
You barge into my OR to work on my
patient

Jack’s tone is somber - reserved - there is something between
him and his father he does not want to articulate -

JACK
You didn’t have to do the
procedure

SHEPHARD
I don’t have to do anything

JACK
-- Yeah Of course you don’t

SHEPHARD
I chose to do this procedure --
this emergency procedure -- because
when that girl crashed in the ER

they called me

JACK
Iwas upstairs -

SHEPHARD
And you should have stayed there -
How did you even know about

JACK
One of the nurses came to get me

This effectively freezes Shephard for a moment Then --

SHEPHARD
Who

Jack wont take the bait and put another person in dad’s
cross-hairs Keeps his mouth shut

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Well Thank God I have you and
some anonymous nurse to rescue me -

JACK
She told me your hands were
shaking

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 10

SHEPHARD JACK
My hands weren’t
-- You cut her hepatic
artery she bled out -

SHEPHARD
She was in a car crash - her
insides were a mess -

But these two aren’t even talking anymore - this thing
becomes a street fight in extremely short order -

JACK SHEPHARD
-- You made a mistake -- They called me Not you
-- I don’t care whether they -- You’re lecturing me
called you are not you made
amistake -- Tell me -- if you were
upstairs and I was at lunch
-- Oh Oh Okay then why did they call me

- And finally Jack actually RAISES HIS VOICE --

JACK
How many drinks did you have at
lunch dad

It just hangs there - OUT LOUD AT LAST in the shadow of
the death of a patient there is little else to add

An interminable moment passes between father and son - the
birth of an unbridgeable gulf And ON JACK we HEAR

LOCKE (VO)
Jack
(then)
Jack

MATCH CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - CLEARING - RESUME 11
Jack turning to see Locke Kate and Boone

LOCKE (0S)
Good thing you’ve been going ina

(then)
Not the best search grid but we
might not have found you otherwise

(CONTD) 11

ON KATE happy to see him And despite the circumstances
he’s happy to see her too

KATE
You find anything

JACK
(ashamedangry)
No
Locke approaches compassionate Sincere --
LOCKE
You should get back to the caves
Sayid’s leg

- but Jack shrugs him off even as Locke continues to try to

be a voice of reason

JACK
I dressed Sayid’s leg You found
me -- Then we can find Charlie and

Claire So do we have a trail to
follow or not

LOCKE
Jack --
(beat)
This is my fault

JACK
What

LOCKE
I’ve been hunting with Ethan
Spent time with him Never sensed

anything

(beat)
off

(then pointed)
For everything I know -- about
hunting Tracking Whoever he
is he knows more If we catch

up to him -- I don’t want anything
to happen to the only trained
physician on the island

(beat)
Go back and be the doctor - let me
be the hunter

No malice or threat in any of what Locke said Just genuine
concern Jack just looks at him And after a beat --

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 11

JACK
Can we go now

Beat Locke shakes his head If that’s the way it’s going
to be --

LOCKE
Follow me

And as Locke turns to go Jack does indeed follow
Exchanging a look with Kate And then BOONE --

BOONE
Jack

- and although innocuous enough given their past history it

is clear that Boone’s greeting is intended to give Jack the
sense that Boone is finally playing with the big dogs

Off Jack offering Boone a cursory nod
INT THE VALLEY - DAY 12

Hurley watches as Michael fills water bottles and puts them
in a backpack Another five CASTAWAYS work nearby -

MICHAEL
- I’m trying to help and all the
guy can tell me is to “go south”
Like what I’m gonna get in his way
or something

HURLEY

Look man everyone’s tweaked -
Locke’s feelin’ it just like the
rest of us -

Michael stands and indicates the other five Castaways -

MICHAEL

So what I got five other guys who
are going out there with me
putting our necks on the line to
find Charlie and Claire

(beat)
All I’m saying is I’m getting sick
of being treated like a second-
class citizen around here just
because Mount Baldy knows how to
bag a boar

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
12 (CONTD) 12

Hurley shrugs back his dissent realizing that Michael needs
to vent - but a third voice comes to Locke’s defense -

WALT

He knows a lot more than how to get
a boar

(off the looks)
Mr Locke’s a warrior He knows
how to hunt and track and stuff -
and he’s the only one who brought
knives If he told me to stay out
of his way

- but Walt realizes that his dad is qlaring at him

WALT (CONTD)
(timidly)
L’d listen to him

MICHAEL
(beat then)
Well I don’t want you to
Y’ understand

A beat Walt nods Then

MICHAEL (CONTD)
You stay with Hurley I might not
be a warrior But I’m going south
(to the group)
Let’s go

Michael walks off with the others Walt watches him go
feeling as guilty as he does righteous He looks up at

Hurley
HURLEY
Back home I’m known as something
of a warrior myself
Walt just stares -- is this guy fucking with him A beat

Then Hurley smiles Walt reluctantly smiles too --
13 EXT JUNGLE - DAY 13
ECU on a red t-shirt WIDER TO REVEAL Locke cutting a strip

off the shirt with his knife then tying the strip to a tree
as Boone watches on -

HO

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204

(CONTD) 13
LOCKE
We keep our progress marked by line
of sight -- we tie these off so we

don’t get lost

BOONE
But you can lead us back to camp
right

LOCKE

Unless something happens to me

Boone doesn’t like the sound of that -- but he’s not gonna
SHOW IT Puts out his hand

BOONE
Then maybe I better take marker
detail

Locke smiles appreciatively Hands over the shirt

FIND JACK and KATE the former anxiously coming back towards
them --

JACK
Anything

LOCKE
Not yet

Locke takes out a bottle of water Takes a SWIG

JACK
If you can’t find the --

LOCKE
I‘ll pick it up again But we
should rest for a minute Get our
clarity back

Locke offers the water bottle to Jack --

JACK
Youre taking a break It’s four
o’clock man -- if the sun sets

there’s no way

LOCKE
It’s four twenty-five and yes --
I’m taking a break
(then)
Sorry

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 13

Jack can’t fucking believe this Boone looks on somewhat
intrigued by what’s happening here as KATE moves up to Jack--

KATE
(sotto)
Can I talk to you

And OFF JACK trying to engage in a staredown with Locke but
not getting his opponent to engage

UPCUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - A FEW METERS AWAY - MOMENTS LATER 14
Kate and Jack alone now
KATE
Would it kill you to give the guy a
little bit of space
JACK
It might
KATE JACK
Stop that
What
KATE
That

He knows exactly what she means Jack shakes his head in
frustration

KATE (CONTD)
What’s going on

A beat Then --

JACK
I didn’t believe her Claire
(really fucking angry at
himself )
I gave her a sedative

KATE
Jack -- You can’t

JACK
She told me someone was coming
after her That she was
attacked and she sounded so
out of it

JACK (CONTD)
I thought the pregnancy was amping
up her stress I just --
(stops himself pained)
I didn’t believe her

Kate just looks at him Feeling his pain Not knowing what
to say to make it go away And that’s when --

BOONE (0S)
JACK KATE

And as Jack and Kate turn to the sound of Boone’s VOICE --
UPCUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 15
Kate and Jack rush up to join Boone standing over a
CROUCHING LOCKE All their interest focused on what’s in
Locke’s hand -- He holds it up and opens his palm slowly

KATE
What is it

And now we’re CLOSE ON IT --

- a piece of gauze bandage with the letter “L” written on it
with magic marker

And just as we’re beginning to connect to what it might be
let’s instantly SHARE with those not as familiar with the
show as we are --

FLASH CUT TO
EXT BEACH - DAY - FLASHBACK (FROM EPISODE 101) 16
CHARLIE - as seen at the end of “Tabula Rasa” - sitting by

the fire on the beach using a Sharpie to write the word
“LATE” on the gauze bandages wrapped around his knuckles

After lingering on Charlie’s knuckles for a moment -

FLASH CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - RESUME 17
Locke examines the gauze - turns around and looks to Jack
his eyes TWINKLING maybe he’d be smiling if the

circumstances were slightly different --

LOCKE
Look familiar

BOONE

JACK

He’s leaving us a trail

Locke nods -- Hell yeah he is

And OFF JACK for the first time since we began despair

actually replaced by HOPE --

OPEN ON an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the “A” scribbled on a piece
of gauze from Charlie’s knuckle And we RACK FOCUS to find
it in the hand of --

JACK Crouching at the base of a BANYAN TREE in a beautiful
JUNGLE CLEARING Beyond the tree a narrow SWATCH of path
cuts through the DENSE JUNGLE

JACK
They went this way

WIDEN to reveal Kate and Boone a few yards behind Jack All
of them COVERED IN SWEAT -- BREATHING HARD --

But LOCKE is actually ACROSS THE CLEARING RUNS his fingers
along the slightly BENT BRANCHES OF A FERN --

LOCKE
I’m not so sure
(turns to the others)
There’s another trail here

Jack stands crosses to Locke --

JACK
What do you mean another --

LOCKE
(points to the grass)
These are footprints People moved
off this way

Jack holds up the “A” Feels he’s getting close --
FRUSTRATION MOUNTING --

JACK
Charlie is leaving us these to
follow
(points back towards the
Banyan)
They’re heading that way

Locke just looks at him Then --
KATE (0S)
What if Charlie isn’t the one

leaving them

Both men turn towards Kate --

Take off one way then double-back

in his own footprints

And the SURPRISE registers on Jack’s face as what he’s
thinking is verbalized by --

BOONE
Wait -- Now you’re a tracker

Kate says nothing playing a LOOK with Jack as Locke turns to
her AMUSED --

LOCKE
You’re just full of surprises

Locke doesn’t know the half of it Jack shakes off his
surprise simply doesn’t have the time because it’s pretty
fucking clear what they’ve gotta do --

JACK
If there are two trails we split
up I’m taking this one --

LOCKE
(shakes his head)
We should stay together Jack

JACK
Why We have two trails
(pointed to Kate)
And apparently two trackers
A moment

Locke considers this And since Jack isn’t really asking for
permission he doesn’t have much of a choice Finally --

LOCKE
Be careful

And as the four exchange a series of LOOKS the safety of
their number about to be HALVED --

You ever think he might’ve lied
about his name

A large leaf covering the view gives way as Jack SMASHES it
away pushing through the path with great speed

KATE
Would you please slow down Jack

Jack stops as Kate catches up

JACK
You said they went this way

KATE
I think they went this way I’m

So when’d you pick up the tracking

were on the run

And with that KATE abruptly STOPS

After a few beats Jack realizes she’s not behind him Turns

back to her And we can see that she’s HURT --

KATE
I’m trying to help Jack

JACK
You know what might help A little
honesty Just give me something
real Anything

Kate just looks at him Then after a moment --

KATE
My dad was in the Army Ranger
Battalion We were stationed at
Fort Lewis Washington State We
would go hiking together One day
we spent eight hours tracking
deer being in the woods that
was his religion

And there’s something else here Something DEEPER But --

KATE (CONTD)
That was real

That’s all she’s gonna give him now So she just stands
there watching him Then after a moment -

KATE (CONTD)
Anything you wanna share Jack

Jack looks at Kate - what does she mean About his father
About his driven need to find Claire About anything
personal

No - this is his turn to be mysterious

JACK
No

in the memories brought on by this conversation --

INT HOSPITAL

— SHEPHARDS OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK 22

Shephard sits at his desk paging through a surgical incident
report doesn’t bother to look up as Jack enters

SHEPHARD

Thanks for coming Jack Sit down

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304
22 (CONTD) 22

Jack doesn’t Shephard pushes the report across the desk

JACK
What’s it say

SHEPHARD
The truth

Jack looks at his father who stands to meet his gaze

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
That a patient was brought to

the ER following a car accident
rushed into surgery with massive
internal bleeding You joined me --
and in spite of our most heroic
efforts -- the patient succumbed to
her injuries

Jack picks up the file then with a bitter edge
JACK
Looks like you fixed everything but
the patient

Jack expects Shephard to blow and is ready for the fight
But Shephard doesn’t He let’s Jack’s statement hang there

JACK (CONTD)
You had no business being in that
operating room

SHEPHARD
You really think I’d have walked in
there if I couldn’t handle it

JACK
Youve done it before

Shepard doesn’t deny this Almost a sense of pride about it

he’s a great surgeon and he knows it - almost too well

SHEPHARD
That’s right I have - and I’m
fully capable of making those
decisions --

JACK
How can you say that after
yesterday

SHEPHARD
You were part of the team I’m not
the only one on the hook for this
(beat)
You called me off You were the
surgeon of record when she died

Jack doesn’t reply He’s willing to let the chips fall where
they may and Shephard knows it

Shepard softens his tone and approach

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Accidents happen in surgeries all
the time Jack You know that
That’s the truth But if you
contradict this report -- mention
alcohol -- well that’s the only
fact that will matter They’1l
strip me of my license

JACK
Yes they will

Jack looks up at his father And he’s surprised because
instead of anger he sees something he’s never seen in his
father’s face before --

His features have gone soft Into fear vulnerability
Shephard RUBS the bridge of his nose shakes his head
despondently Let’s face it it freaks Jack out

SHEPHARD
I know I’ve been hard on you

Possibly the greatest understatement of all time

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
But that’s how you make metal into
steel
(beat)
And that’s why you’re the most
gifted young surgeon in this city

Jesus Christ Did Jack just hear that right

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
This is a career that’s all about
the greater good I’ve had to
sacrifice certain aspects of my
relationship with you so that
hundreds

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
thousands of patients will live
will thrive because of your
extraordinary skills

And oh my God tears are welling in Shephard’s eyes This
cracks Jack’s own visage of determination hits him in an
emotional place he’s unprepared for He’s getting what he’s
always wanted when he very least expected it

Shephard steps up puts his hand on Jack’s shoulder

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Long time coming I know

Shephard picks up the file arranges the papers neatly
inside to cover his own emotions Then he turns to Jack
with complete sincerity

SHEPHARD (CONT’D)
What happened today I promise
you -- it’1ll never happen again

Shephard holds out a pen What he says next -- it goes so
much to Shephard’s emotional core he can barely get it out

above a whisper --

SHEPHARD (CONT’D)
What I’ve given This isn’t just
my career Jack This is my life

The pen hovers there in Shephard’s hand An interminable
beat And then Jack reaches out And takes it

Jack makes the toughest choice of his life He signs the
false surgery report

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Thank you Son

And OFF JACK already torn by what he’s just done

Sayid sees Sawyer squatting a few meters away

SAWYER (CONTD)

served you up a heaping platter of
cosmic payback

Sayid backs himself up against the cave wall facing Sawyer

SAYID
What do you want

SAWYER

Doctor do-right don’t trust me with
his antibiotics so I have to hump
here every day to get my meds

Apropos of nothing a less
magnanimous man than I might just

You want a shot take it but
know that I left this camp out of
shame for what I did to you It
was never my intention to return

SAWYER
You cut me up put bamboo under my

Something like what
Sayid tilts his head back -- frustrated He shouldn’t have

opened up to him after all

SAYID
Do you have something to say to me
Sawyer Or are you going to
continue to ask me questions you
know I don’t have the answers to

ON SAWYER Busted But doesn’t want to let Sayid know it
So he just shakes his head Gets up Turns to go --

EXT JUNGLE - THE FOOT OF A MUDDY HILL - DAY 25
The end-of-the-world weather grows even more severe as Jack

and Kate rush to the foot of a hill covered in long grass
and at the foot of the hill wedged between two rocks -

- is the “T” from Charlie’s hand

Jack and Kate exchange looks -

JACK
(grimly)
I guess we were right
(then)
Where to now

- but before Kate can answer the two hear that SOUND again -
the one that Jack heard as he first ventured into the jungle -
something between a rustle of trees and a howl -

- something that distinctly conveys a presence -

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304
(CONTD) 25

- only now the sound is followed by something very close to a
SCREAM from the top of the hill

Or was it a scream The trees The wind

Jack doesn’t care He looks at Kate - and as he stands there
in the rain girding himself for what he knows he must do --

INT HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY - FLASHBACK 26

Jack’s face is blurred - as if the lens has been doused -
until a squee-gee crosses the frame to reveal that Jack is
standing in front of a pair of glass doors at the entrance to
the corridor --

-- he is wearing scrubs and a labcoat and reading a chart
waiting for the JANITOR cleaning the door to step aside so he
can move into the corridor

We get the sense it’s LATE Not the heavy bustle of peak
hours Jack steps past the janitor and SEES --

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY --

SHEPHARD And he’s talking to a VERY SAD LOOKING MAN in his
thirties Both unaware of Jack

And Jack is very interested in this conversation -- Jack
standing there watching his father

And whatever they’re talking about Shephard’s conversation
with the man is intense and COMPASSIONATE --

And just then ANDREA (we may recognize her as one of the
nurses from the OR earlier) emerges through the DOORS right
next to Jack --

ANDREA
Dr Shephard
JACK
Andrea -- do you know who that man

is That my father’s talking to
Andrea looks down the hallway Turns back to Jack SOMBER

ANDREA
That’s her husband

And Jack knows exactly to whom Andrea is referring And
maybe she’s actually a little ACCUSATORY when she says --

ee

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304

ANDREA (CONT’D)
He’s threatening to sue
And with that she walks OFF

BACK ON JACK as he continues to watch the conversation

37A

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304 38
(CONTD) 26

DOWN THE HALLWAY

The MAN breaks into a WRACKING SOB And although this is
Jack’s POV we make sure we get all this because --

Shephard RUBS the bridge of his nose shakes his head
despondently And gently places his hand on the man’s
shoulder

And Jack doesn’t even need to hear the words to know --

He has just watched his father “handle” another persons
emotional crisis in the exact way he handled his own son

THE CRASH OF THUNDER BRINGS US BACK TO --

EXT JUNGLE - HILLSIDE - RESUME 27

- Jack - having just heard the SCREAM from the top of the
hill ready to do what he has to do he springs into action -
powering himself up the muddy slope

Kate follows - the hill grows steeper and steeper Jack drops
to a crawling position - clinging on to the grass as Kate
comes up behind him -

They turn and scramble across the side of the incline
Grabbing hold of anything to keep them vertical

KATE
This is -- can’t be right -- how
could they have gone this way

JACK
Just follow me keep moving

Jack presses on into the driving rain
And in the rain and buffeting wind another sound seems to

come and go everywhere around them - strange WHISPERS (like
those heard by Sayid in “Solitary”)

That’s when the sodden slope under his feet gives way Jack
falls Grabs for something anything No luck Gravity
takes over He begins to tumble down the slope

Now that he’s got his momentum going there’s no way he’s
going to stop himself He’s a one man tumbling human
avalanche nearly free-falling through the rain down the
steep slope

BACK TO JACK

Slipping sliding tumbling he finally rolls to a stop ina
tangle of jungle at the bottom of the slope --

EXT JUNGLE - FOOT OF A LARGE TREE - RESUMING

Jack reaches for his aching head -- DISORIENTED -- DIZZY --
RAIN pouring down on him --

And this is something he SENSES before he actually looks up
and sees it And we SENSE it too --

There is someone here

And as Jack slowly looks up -- standing right in front of him
-- just FIVE FUCKING FEET AWAY --

Is ETHAN

ETHAN
Hello Jack

Holy Fucking Shit

Jack looks at him ragged breath but EYES BURNING And he
asks the question that hopefully all of America has been
asking for the past week --

JACK
Who are you

And were LOOKING UP at Ethan SOAKING WET but seemingly
oblivious to the rain And his EYES His FUCKING EYES

ETHAN
Stop Following Me

JACK
Where are they What did you do
with them What --

Ethan cuts Jack off by STOMPING down on Jack’s CHEST with his

foot pressing him down into the MUDDY GROUND Jack
winces and Ethan makes sure Jack is good and uncomfortable
before reiterating his warning

e
LOST All the Best (PINK) 101504 40
(CONTD)

ETHAN
You are not understanding so
listen very closely

And he PUSHES down with his foot even HARDER Into Jack’s
SOLAR PLEXUS Cutting off his breathing Ethan leans in

And when he says this it is CHILLING --
ETHAN (CONTD)

If you do not stop following me
I will kill one of them

Yeah We heard that right And Ethan fucking means it

ETHAN (CONTD)
Do you understand

TIGHT on Jack’s eyes as he ABSORBS THIS Understands it
But he doesn’t ACCEPT IT

Jack summons every last bit of his strength to get himself
out from under Ethan’s foot -

-— REACHES UP grabs ETHAN’S ANKLE -- PUSHES -- Ethan’s LEG
TWISTS -- SPLASH -- HE GOES DOWN IN THE MUD

Jack ROLLS OVER GOES for Ethan and --

THIS IS CLOSE QUARTS COMBAT RAIN FALLING But it quickly
becomes APPARENT that ETHAN IS ONE BAD MOTHERFUCKER as --

SMASH HIS OPEN PALM JAMS into JACK’S NECK -- An ELBOW under
his CHIN -- ETHAN IS JUST SO FUCKING FAST AND BRUTAL -- BLOW
AFTER BLOW -- All covered in QUICK AND DEVASTATING CUTS til --

Jack literally FLIES BACK into the MUD Onto his back
Completely SPENT Done

Defeated
And as Ethan begins to move towards JACK --

ETHAN (CONTD)
No more warnings

And as he cocks his fist back and DRIVES it towards camera

Kate reaches for her bag pulls out a rag -

I’m not letting him do this

Kate looks at Jack - the look on his face is FARAWAY - like
he isn’t thinking about Ethan anymore -- Kate’s confused --

KATE
Not letting him --

But Jack is already moving for the INCLINE and begins to SLOG
his way back up --

KATE (CONT’D)
JACK

But he’s not listening And as we CLOSE IN on him more
INTENSE NOW than we’ve ever seen --

JACK
(under his breath)

Not again

And the sounds of the jungle -- and Jack’s breathing -- begin
to drop out as --

SHEPHARD (0S)
- at which time the patient went
into cardiac arrest -

INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 30

The INSANITY of the jungle is replaced by the quiet austerity
of a HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM as we find ---

JACK Calmly sitting at the POLISHED TABLE as his father
commands the room addressing a group of FIVE OTHER DOCTORS --

SHEPHARD
- of course every effort was made
to resuscitate the patient - but
the severity of her injuries and
the amount of internal bleeding
made it impossible

Shephard looks at the members of the board clear decisive
Shit -- We saw what happened and we believe him

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204

SHEPHARD (CONTD)

In my professional opinion -- and
that’s all I’ve got gentlemen
(somber yet responsible)

By the time I was called in the

damage was irreversible

On Jack STOIC Can’t bring himself to look at his dad

The Board members make their final notes exchange glances
Finally the HEAD DOCTOR speaks up -

HEAD DOCTOR
Thanks Christian Sorry about the
formality

SHEPHARD
(shakes his head)
Of course

Jack keeps his expression neutral - knowing that he just has

to stay still until this is over and then he can wash his
hands of the entire affair

And that’s when --

HEAD DOCTOR
Just one final detail - you were
aware of the patient’s pregnancy
when you went into the procedure

- pregnancy Jack looks at his father who doesn’t react -

but as Shephard gives a lucid convincing response the look

on Jacks face indicates his distress at this revelation -

SHEPHARD
Absolutely The patient’s husband
informed the attending at the ER
It was however extremely early in
the pregnancy and out primary focus
had to be on the mother

And while the Board buys the line - we settle on JACK

Because he DIDN’T know that

And Jack now realizes it wasn’t just a woman’s life that was
destroyed The truth is inescapable a family’s entire
future died that day -- and his eyes swell with tears as it
becomes clear why Jack has been hell bent on saving Claire
another pregnant woman under his charge

HEAD DOCTOR
Okay then I think we’re done and
the final report will be filed --

JACK (0S)
I need to revise my statement

And that’s when everyone turns to --

JACK And now -- as he speaks -- he IS looking at his
father RIGHT at him

JACK (CONTD)
I didn’t come into the OR until
well into the procedure

SHEPHARD
Jack

JACK
(ignores him)
I was warned by one of the nurses
that my father was operating under
the influence -

SHEPHARD
Jack This is not--

JACK
(louder now)

By the time I got there it was
clear that my father was not only
incapacitated but that he severed
the patient’s hepatic artery which
in my professional opinion caused
the crisis that led to her death

And there it is Let it sit Let it sink in

And as we realize what the implications of this are going to
be -- that the career of Christian Shephard MD has
officially just ended -

Andso has Jack’s relationship with his father

EXT JUNGLE - HILLTOP - DAY 31

Jack and Kate clear the hillside and rush into the dense
wilderness - their pace is determined - even as the foliage
around them grows thicker blotting out the light -

LOST All the Best ( YELLOW) 101804
(CONTD) 31

- Kate leads the way - until she knocks down a large leaf and
finds herself face-to-face with -

CHARLIE’S HAND - THE “E” STILL ON HIS PINKY

- attached to the rest of Charlie -

- REVEALED hanging above them - with a noose wrapped around
his neck And a ratty cloth BLINDFOLD covering his eyes

KATE SCREAMS

And before we can take in the full HORROR of all of this
THANK FUCKING GOD --

Jack is here

He wraps his arms around Charlie’s legs pushing him up to
get some slack on the rope allowing him to breathe -

JACK
You have to cut the noose

Kate pulls out one of Locke’s knives but -

KATE
- I can’t reach it -

JACK
- hold him -

Kate grabs Charlie awkwardly exchanging the knife with Jack
but in the muddy ground even as tall as he is Jack can’t
get to the noose with the knife -
- so he grabs a hold of Charlie again - turning to Kate -
JACK (CONTD)
You have to cut the rope from the
tree - go
IN QUICK CUTS
EXT JUNGLE - TREE - DAY 32
- Kate climbs the slippery trunk - her foot slips - she

slides down until she grabs onto a branch - barely hanging
on while -

JACK

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304 46
(CONTD) 32

- struggles to keep Charlie up above the rope choking him
but the mud and rain make it tremendously difficult -

JACK
Just hold on Charlie - hold on

- as Jack wages his battle to keep Charlie breathing -
KATE

- launches herself onto a branch - she can see the rope a
white line dead ahead - as she moves drawing the knife -

JACK
- he loses his grasp on Charlie his feet sliding on the
muddy earth - then - as Jack picks him back up -
KATE

- finally reaches the end of the branch - she holds out the
knife - but the rope is just out of arm’s length

Kate tries to marshal her anger and frustration - she holds
on to another branch - arches her body forward and -

- SLASHES through the rope with the knife

JACK

- falls to the ground breaking Charlie’s fall Scrambling
to his knees Jack lays Charlie out PULLS OFF THE BLINDFOLD

as Kate descends from the tree and hurries over

Jack checks for vital signs - but Charlie’s body is inert
limp his eyes are shut - his lips are blue -

JACK (CONTD)
He’s not breathing

- and a look of dread plays across Kate’s face - an
uncontrollable emotional response to the blunt truth staring
her in the eye -

- Charlie is dead

But Jack has not come this far to let it go He tilts
Charlie’s head back to unblock the airway - still not
breathing - Jack breathes into Charlie’s mouth -

- nothing - without hesitation Jack rips into Charlies
shirt and starts compressions -

LOST All the Best ( YELLOW) 101804
(CONTD) 32

Jack breathes into Charlie’s mouth again - nothing - He
resumes compressions -

JACK (CONTD)
Come on come on

- Kate just stands there helpless in SHOCK --

JACK (CONTD)
Come on breathe

- Jack puts his ear to Charlie’s MOUTH -- NOTHING -- Tilts
Charlie’s head back -- BREATHES IN TO IT -- Back to
compressions -- his eyes absolutely fucking DESPERATE -

- and Kate breaks into sobs beside him -

JACK (CONTD)
Come on -- Breathe COME IN

- Kate struggles to choke back her tears -

KATE
Hes He’s not --

But Jack SLAMS his closed fist into Charlie’s chest -- AGAIN
AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN

Puts his ear to Charlie’s mouth checking for breath --
Waiting -- Waiting for something ANYTHING --

AND SUDDENLY WERE WIDE --

Looking at this tableau from twenty yards away Charlie
still Jack bending over him Kate standing behind them

SILENCE

And we just sit here for an excruciatingly long moment Long
enough to know in our hearts

Charlie is gone
AND WE COME BACK IN CLOSE as --
Kate gently puts her hand on Jack’s shoulder --

KATE (CONTD)
Jack

JACKS EYES -- DEFEAT SORROW FAILURE

LOST All the Best ( YELLOW) 101804 A47A
(CONTD) 32

And just when we think it’s over That Jack has given up

SLAM He hits Charlie’s chest again And he screams this at

the top of his lungs -- louder than he has ever fucking
screamed in his LIFE --
JACK

COME ON

And as he raises his fist to bring it down again

LOST All the Best ( YELLOW) 101804
(CONTD) 32

- Charlie shoots up with a GASP taking his first breath in
minutes

Kate bursts into tears scooping Charlie up in her arms as he
sputters his way back to life Jack leans back looking up -
until Kate puts her hand on his shoulder -

- Jack turns to look at her and Charlie - battered and still
gasping but alive - Kate smiles through her tears -

- and so does Jack out of breath heart and mind racing
finally allowing himself a moment of joy after this ordeal

-and off the three joined in this moment of victory -
however dark the context of it may be

CUT TO BLACK

ACT FIVE

33 - 34 OMITTED 33 - 34

INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 35

CLOSE UP on a pair of hands weaving palm fronds together -
WIDER to REVEAL Hurley doing the weaving - although whatever
it is that he is weaving isn’t coming together very well -

WALT
That’s never going to look like a
hat

HURLEY

Who says it’s a hat

- but this conversation abruptly ends when Walt turns and
sees --

WALT
Dad

Walt shoots to his feet and runs to the valley entrance as -
MICHAEL

-- enters with his search party Walt races up to his dad -
and then stops --

-- because the look on Michael’s face is grim a father who
knows he is about to disappoint his son

MICHAEL
We didn’t find them Walt

WALT
I’m just
(hard for him to say this)
Glad youre okay

Michael reaches forward and takes Walt by the shoulder
drawing him into an embrace Then after a moment --

MICHAEL
We the only ones back

Walt shakes his head -- points across the valley at --

CHARLIE

LOST All the Best (BLUE ) 101304 49A
35 (CONTD) 35

-- who sits on a ledge wrapped in a blanket Jack and Kate
looking over him Even from here we can see that Charlie’s
eyes are hollow distant

BACK TO OUR GROUP
Walt looks up at his father concerned --
WALT

He hasn’t said anything since he
came back

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 35

MICHAEL
Did they find Claire

As Walt shoots his father a scared look -- the answer etched
on his face --

KATE

-- moves off from Jack and Charlie towards the SPRING to get
more water Hears a VOICE --

SHANNON (0OS)
They aren’t back yet

Kate stops Turns to see SHANNON Something on Shannons

face that we are not akin to -- WORRY
KATE
I’m sure they just made camp for
the night

(forces a smile)
If there’s anyone on this island
that your brother’s gonna be safe
with it’s Locke

And OFF SHANNON about as sure of that as we are --

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT 36
We find LOCKE and BOONE moving through the jungle Locke
GUIDING the way with a POWERFUL FLASHLIGHT as they SPLASH
through a small STREAM

Boone follows a few steps behind It’s clear his earlier
bravado has been replaced by FEAR

BOONE
Are we lost

LOCKE
No Boone We’re not lost

BOONE
It’s just I don’t see how you
can still be following the trail
But Locke just POWERS on Guided by well something

BOONE (CONT’D)
I think we should go back man

And Locke stops Turns to Boone --

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 36

And we’re getting that old familiar feeling That one we
haven’t felt in awhile --

That Locke KNOWS something the rest of us don’t

LOCKE
Don’t you feel it
BOONE
(confused)
Feel what
LOCKE
It

ON BOONE Maybe a little CREEPED OUT by this And Boone is
backing off now not liking this one bit --

BOONE
Okay John -- I’m just gonna follow
the strips back okay
Locke just stands there

LOCKE
Suit yourself

But Boone is already turning around moving off --
LOCKE (CONTD)
Boone
(Boone turns --)

You need this more than I do
Locke TOSSES him his FLASHLIGHT
But Boone bobbles it It slips through his hands and --
SPLASH Ends up in the STREAM --

BOONE
Dammit

And as Boone crouches down to pick it up he suddenly STOPS

Because the flashlight is illuminating something SHINY in the

stream -- about the size of a book --

A piece of metal

Boone furrows his brow trying to make SENSE OF THIS --

LOST All the Best (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 101204
(CONTD) 36

BOONE (CONT’D)
Hey John
But Locke is already here -- crouching down next to Boone

BOONE (CONTD)
What is it

Locke looks at Boone -- UNSHEATHES his biggest KNIFE

And uses it to POKE the metal under the water TAPS it
against the surface

LOCKE
Steel

BOONE
Maybe it’s wreckage -- part of our
plane

Locke uses his knife to SCRAPE away DIRT around the periphery
of the metal REVEALING MORE METAL We can see from Locke’s
curious-but-determined expression THIS IS NO PIECE OF THE
PLANE

Now even Boone is doubting that it came from their jet Even
in the darkness it is clear that this thing is shiny
polished and part of something much larger

BOONE (CONTD)
What is that

And we’re ON LOCKE -- clearly fascinated by this thing And
it is most definitely worthy of that fascination -- And
after a moment -- Locke looks over at Boone --
LOCKE
That’s what we’re going to find
out

And OFF BOONE OFF LOCKE AND OFF THAT SUBMERGED METAL
INT THE VALLEY - A LEDGE - NIGHT 37

Jack sits with Charlie GENTLY pressing on the already
PURPLING BRUISE around his neck

JACK

Nothing from Charlie
