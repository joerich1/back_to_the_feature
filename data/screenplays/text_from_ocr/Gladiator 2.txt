GLADIATOR 2
4 CREDIT SEQUENCE

A dense blanket of rain descends on a vast sodden wilderness TWO
THIEVES dressed in rags hair plastered to their faces run through the
deluge One holds a wooden staff in his hand They puff and pant
Occasionally they stop and point through the impenetrable rain then trudge
on Eventually they stop THIEF ONE looks up into the rain THIEF TWO
looks down at the ground below

2 EXT WILDERNESS

CU of MAXIMUS lying arms splayed in the mud unconscious Rain
hammers down He wears his gladiatorial breastplate and his sword rests in
his lifeless hand The TWO THIEVES like buzzards swoop down upon
him The TWO THIEVES strip MAXIMUS of his breastplate THIEF ONE
puts on the breastplate and roars with toothless laughter He brandishes his
staff

THIEF ONE
Ah the mighty gladiator Take up your sword
you dog

THIEF TWO picks up MAXIMUS’ sword

THIEF TWO
Dog piss in your mother’s milk Prepare
to die

TWO THIEVES cackle with laughter then mock-fight over the lifeless body
of MAXIMUS THIEF TWO stops suddenly stands rigid for a moment his
face full of stupid surprise

THIEF TWO
Vn hit

THIEF TWO wavers drops the sword then falls flat on his face in the mud A
spear hangs out of his back THIEF ONE still wearing the breastplate turns
and flees across the mudded expanse disappearing into the rain

MAXIMUS with a great sucking of breath rears suddenly up His eyes wide
with horror he looks about him He tries to stand but is too weak He sees a
figure (MORDECAI) moving mysteriously toward him through the rain
MORDECAI (40 years old) reaches MAXIMUS He stands over him He
gestures at the dead THIEF

MORDECAI
Another poor wretch despatched to oblivion

Again MAXIMUS tries to stand but cannot MORDECAI squats down beside
him

MORDECAI
Take it slow my friend

MAXIMUS looks around bewildered as if waking from a dream

MAXIMUS
What place is this

MORDECAI
That is a good question

MAXIMUS reaches out in panic grabs MORDECAI roughly by the collar and
pulls him close

MAXIMUS
asked you what place is this

MORDECAI detaches himself from MAXIMUS’ grip

MORDECAI
At first you will be disorientated and confused
and indeed a little vexed It is to be expected
But direct your anger elsewhere am a friend
Let me help you stand

MORDECAI helps MAXIMUS to his feet

MAXIMUS
Who are you

MORDECAI wraps his hands around the spear that sticks out of the dead
THIEFS’ back

MORDECAI
Me My name is Mordecai
MORDECAI places his foot on the dead THIEFS’ back for leverage and with
a grunt pulls free the spear

ORDECAI
keep the peace

MORDECAI turns his back on MAXIMUS and begins to move away He
stops He turns to MAXIMUS

ORDECAI
Well come on Follow me

MORDECAI trudges off through the rain MAXIMUS picks up his sword
then unsteady and drained follows

3 EXT ROCK LEDGE SHELTER FOOT OF AHILL

MAXIMUS and MORDECAI sit under the shelter of a ledge jutting froma
tock face at the foot of a rise Rain hammers down MORDECAI shouts to
be heard above the rain He hands MAXIMUS some bread some meat

MAXIMUS takes the food and eats ravenously MORDECAI hands
MAXIMUS a bladder of wine

MORDECAI

MORDECAI
You have an eternity
4 EXT TOLEDO WHEATFIELDS DREAM

MAXIMUS walks through golden wheat fields touching the tips of wheat with
his fingers In the distance by a farm house and beneath a giant poplar
stands his wife MARIA and his seven-year-old son MARIUS MAXIMUS
walks toward them Without warning great bruised storm clouds move
across the sky and it begins to rain heavily The rain is so dense MAXIMUS
can barely see his wife and child There is a rumble of thunder and a bolt of
lightning leaps from the sky and with a great crack cleaves the mighty poplar

in haif

6 EXT RISE OF HILL

MAXIMUS and MORDECAI walk up ihe rise of a steep hill The rain beats
down The sky growls and a fork of lightning pitches itself from the heavens
MAXIMUS looks up at the heavens then all around him He is in a state of
great agitation

MAXIMUS
Thunder

MORDECAI

MAXIMUS
There is another place than this A place of wheat

My wife and son are there They await me

MORDECA

MAXIMUS
Elysium was moving toward Elysium Sunlight
Wheat fields The great poplar must find them

MORDECA
Calm yourself Maximusand take heed

MAXIMUS and MORDECAI approach the top of the rise

MAXIMUS
will find them

MORDECAI stops MAXIMUS a few feet before the top of the rise

MORDECAI
Listen to me Maximus There are two types of people
here Those who search and those who have given up
the search The former in time always becomes the
latter To search is to hope and well herethere is no
hope

MAXIMUS
Tell me where we arel

MORDECAI
That is simply the way it is You will learn in time
that eternity is the state of things at this very moment
We inhale We exhale And our blood pumps endlessly
around our body without pause and for all time It
sends some people mad you know

MAXIMUS looks at the wilderness around hirn

MAXIMUS
No dor’t know What people

MORDECAI escorts MAXIMUS to the top of the rise and gestures to the

valley below

MORDE
Those people

MAXIMUS stands at the top of the hill and looks down through the rain in

horror

7 EXT THE ENCAMPMENT

Below them on a vast plateau am
edge of a flat black sea a massive

ultitude of people are camped by the
refugee camp that stretches on

endlessly Fires burn amongst the improvised shelters and thousands of

people sit forlorn and hopeless in ¢

eir squalor A fog hangs lifelessly over

the dark motionless water of the sea MAXIMUS stares down

MAXIMUS
What unholy place is this

MORDECAI
This my friend is a dumping ground for the

inconsequent
suspect ther

© are many such places as these It

was not always so well impossible

MAXIMUS moves off in the directio

of the encampment MORDECAI

But not anymore Something unheard is happening

CAI
é€ It dees not need one

own into the crowd The mob eyes them
mongst them with authority Bedraggled
wait in their rough shelters They part for
MORDECAI and MAXIMUS as they weave their way through A desperate
looking WOMAN pushes past MAXIMUS and MORDECAI

WOMAN
Cow

The WOMAN kicks over ANOTHER WOMAN’S cooking pot and the two of
them brawl rolling in the mud tearing at each other MORDECAI reaches
down takes the desperate WOMAN roughly by the hair and hauls her off

MORDECAI
What is the problem here

The desperate WOMAN stares sullenly at MORDECAI

MORDECAI
asked you a question

The desperate WOMAN lowers her eyes MORDECAI pushes her away and
she disappears into the throng MORDECAI uprights the cooking pot then
turns to MAXIMUS

MORDECAI
Womenthey are the same everywhere

The WOMAN with the cooking pot hands MORDECAI a lump of bread
MAXIMUS and MORDECAI continue through the crowd MORDECAI
chomps on the bread

MORDECAI
They have given me a little powera modest
position of rankl maintain order such as
itis In turn lam rewarded

MAXIMUS
With bread

MORDECAI looks at the bread then tosses it away and laughs

MORDECAI
They allow me brief sojourns home

MAXIMUS
Who are they

MORDECAI points to ruined stone edifice beyond the crowd on the next
rise He sneers and gestures grandly

MORDECAI
Them Up there The all-powerful

MAXIMUS looks up at the ruined temple then looks at MORDECAI

MAXIMUS
And where is home

Once again MORDECAI laughs

MORDECAI
Well Rome of course

MAXIMUS stops walking and grabs MORDECAI by the arm and swings him
round to face him

MAXIMUS
Rome

MORDECAI smiles

MORDECAI
I see Rome but Rome does not see me

MAXIMUS
Speak sense

Suddenly a tremor of excitement ripples through the crowd and people begin
to stand and push and press toward the sea

MORDECAI
The weather there is more agreeable

A great roar goes up and MAXIMUS and MORDECAI are jostled apart

MORDECAI
hight follows day

MAXIMUS and MORDECAI are pushed further apart and MORDECAI
shouts toward MAXIMUS above the din

MORDECAI
the birds sing on the branches
Winter becomes SpringSpring becomes
Summer
MORDECAI throws out his arms in a grand mad gesture

MORDECAI
Look at these fools They think there is some
way out of here

MORDECAI is elbowed in the face and knocked to the ground MAXIMUS
is shoved forward by the crowd They are separated The crowd seem to
chant a word that MAXIMUS cannot make out A toothless OLD MAN eyes
bulging runs into MAXIMUS

OLD MAN
Elysium Elysium

MAXIMUS takes hold of the old man The old man struggles

MAXIMUS
Elysium

OLD MAN
Let me go

MAXIMUS
Where Where is Elysium

OLD MAN
There On the water A boat

MAXIMUS releases the old man aside and pushes his way roughly through
the crowd MAXIMUS reaches the shoreline and stares out at the flat black
expanse of water People have waded into the Sea shouting and crying
and gnashing their teeth A small boat js moving slowly away and MAXIMUS
can just make out the shape of a man head bent holding a crutch silent
amongst the roiling masses before the boat is swallowed up by the fog
Fights break out on the shoreline as peopie hurl themselves at each other
Women wail and beat their breasts Others sit their faces drained of hope
and stare blankly out at the sea MAXIMUS takes ail this in He then turns
and looks up at the ruined temple on the rise and with the crowd rioting
about him begins to walk toward it

8 EXT THE ENCAMPMENT

MAXIMUS pushes through the hordes of people Women huddle over
babies Children cry Men rush this way and that It is a place of great
anguish

9 EXT ENCAMPMENT VENDERS STALL

The crowd has thinned as MAXIMUS makes his way toward the ruined
temple MAXIMUS passes a vendors stall an improvised shelter with a thin
trellis table The VENDOR sees MAXIMUS MAXIMUS sees the VENDOR
The VENDOR gabs something from the table and shoves it underneath
here is a brief moment of recognition as MAXIMUS Iurches forward takes
hold of the VENDOR and drags him onto the table It is the THIEF who stole
the breastplate MAXIMUS says nothing as he stares down at the THIEF
wild-eyed The THIEF reaches back gropes beneath the table and drags
forth the breastplate MAXIMUS takes it off him MAXIMUS releases the

VENDOR the table collapses and the shelter topples around him MAXIMUS
moves off

10 EXT ENTRANCE OF RUINED TEMPLE

MAXIMUS wearing his breastplate approaches the ruined temple
MORDECAI sits on the stone steps of the temple pressing a blood-spotted
rag against his nose MAXIMUS begins to mounts the steps MORDECAI
gestures to the breastplate

MORDECAI
Ah the gladiator restored

MAXIMUS continues up the steps ignoring MORDECAI

MORDECAI
i had a feeling you would come here

MAXIMUS passes MORDECAI MORDECAI dabs at his swollen nose

MORDECAI
They await you my friendbut stay sharp

MAXIMUS enters the temple

MORDECAI

MORDECAI presses the bloody rag back against his nose

11 INT RUINED TEMPLE

MAXIMUS enters the dim confines of the temple Rain leaks through the
broken stonework and runs down the walls A large torch-wheel hangs from
the ceiling on a chain and it swings and creaks SEVEN DISSOLUTE OLD
MEN (JUPITER APOLLO PLUTO NEPTUNE MARS MERCURY
BACCHUS) cluster around a makeshift table their heads craned toward
each other as they mumble amongst themselves MAXIMUS stands before
them The OLD MEN grow silent They look ill and diseased The torch-
wheel creaks JUPITER fat eyes boiled and blood shot sits in the centre
He looks at MAXIMUS and pushes the other OLD MEN away

JUPITER
Give me room

The OLD MEN sit upright tottering drunkenly on their seats JUPITER leans
forward and throws open his arms

JUPITER
Behold the mighty gladiator

The OLD MEN smirk and titter

JUPITER
in all his thundering apparel

The OLD MEN burst into laughter rocking and howling in their seats
JUPITER raises his hand The hilarity dies down MARS spider-thin
sniggers like a girl behind his hand

JUPITER

MAXIMUS stares at JUPITER

JUPITER

JUPITER throws himself back in his seat and laughs then breaks into a
coughing fit Again the OLD MEN roar with laughter MAXIMUS steps
forward and rests his hands on the table He leans in close to JUPITER

MAXIMUS
Can you help me old man or not

In unison the OLD MEN reel back and wave their hands in mock-horror

MARS
Ye Gods The man means business

The OLD MEN laugh JUPITER raises his hand The laughter dies JUPITER
stares into MAXIMUS’ eyes

JUPITER
Old Itis true Buta mere man

JUPITER slowly shakes his head

JUPITER

JUPITER leans forward
JUPITER

MAXIMUS and JUPITER stare at each other
MAXIMUS

JUPITER theatrically cups his hand to his ear

JUPITER
Hush listen what is that hear

The room grows silent The torch-wheel creaks

JUPITER
The winch of fortune turning in your favour

MAXIMUS

JUPITER

breastplate

JUPITER

and exits the temple

MAXIMUS releases MORDECAI MORDECAI points to the ruined temple

MORDECAI

MORDECAI waves his hand toward the next rise miles away

MORDECAI

MAXIMUS stares out at the endless encampment MORDECAI looks at

MAXIMUS reading his thoughts

MORDECAI
There is nothing you can do Maximus One simply

MAXIMUS looks at MORDECAI with scorn

MAXIMUS
Do nothing Then you are of no use to me

MAXIMUS moves off MORDECAI hops along beside him

MORDECAI

MAXIMUS keeps walking
AXIMUS

ORDECAI
Where are you going

AXIMUS
The desert

MAXIMUS lurches off MORDECAI follows

13 EXT EDGE OF THE DESERT

MAXIMUS and MORDECAI stand on the top of a rise looking out over a
barren expanse Behind them way down is the vast encampment over
which squats a great purple rain-filled cloud beyond that the black sea The
expanse in contrast is dry and deserted A merciless sun beats down
MAXIMUS moves on down into the parched landscape MORDECAI remains
sianding on the rise watching solemnly the retreating figure of MAXIMUS

14 EXT THE DESERT

A blistering sun beats down MAXIMUS trudges on through the desert an
endless vista of nettled scrub and thorny thickets and dust and rocks

15 EXT THE DESERT

MAXIMUS sits by a rock He has removed his breastplate which he has
balanced on the rock and propped up with a stick to form an improvised

shelter from the terrible sun He drinks from a skin of water He stares out at
the vast nothingness

15 EXT THE DESERT

MAXIMUS trudges on as the sun sinks his breastplate on his back for
shade like shell

16 EXT THE DESERT CAMP BY THICKET
Darkness descends MAXIMUS sits by a large weird black-thormned thicket
He has fit a small fire There is deathly oppressive stillness He hears
strange half-human half-animal noises He lies down and tries to sleep

17 EXT THE DESERT DREAM

A FIGURE walks forward shimmering in the heat The FIGURE collects its
form as it draws closer It is a woman It is MAXIMUS’ WIFE MARIA

MARIA
Help us Maximus

MARIA moves closer

MARIA
Help us

18 EXT THE DESERT CAMP BY THICKET
MAXIMUS rears up from his sleep It is morning He looks around him

MAXIMUS
Maria

MAXIMUS hears the voice again and he leaps to his feet

VO MARIA
Help usMaximus

MAXIMUS looks around in panic He hears a movement in the thicket turns
and sees a dark fleeting shape

MAXIMUS
Maria

VO MARIA
Help us

MAXIMUS follows the voice skirting the edge of the thicket MAXIMUS
hears a crashing in the brambles and a strangulated moan

MAXIMUS
Maria
MAXIMUS sees the shape again tears at the brambles and finds a great
stag its horns entangled in the thicket The stag looks at MAXIMUS with its
spooked rolling eyes The stags head is torn by the brambles its forehead
speckled in bright blood It opens its mouth soundlessly

VIO MARIA
Help us

MAXIMUS draws his sword and begins to hack at the brambles The deer
bucks and kicks MAXIMUS continues to chop The stag panics and its eyes
roll white It releases a terrible moan The stag chokes itself to death in
thicket and dies MAXIMUS draws back his arms and chest torn by the briar
his sword limp at his side The voice of his WIFE disappears

19 EXT THE DESERT

MAXIMUS trudges through the desert The terrain has become rockier The
sun beats down MAXIMUS sees FIVE PEOPLE wearing pagan masks
squatting on boulders They are naked but for their masks The LEADER
stands He wears the horns of the stag the skin thrown over his back They
watch MAXIMUS as he passes MAXIMUS continues on growing weak the
unholy sun hammering down

20 EXT THE DESERT

MAXIMUS weak and streaked in blood falls to his kneels He bows his
head He closes his eyes

MAXIMUS
Oh my wife my son am sorry

MAXIMUS stays like that for a time He raises his head MAXIMUS sees
ahead of him in the distance shimmering in the heat what looks like a small
man-made shelter He stands unsteadily and moves towards it

ai EXT HEPHAESTOS’ SHELTER

MAXIMUS approaches the shelter Lying on his back on a crude pallet is
HEPHAESTOS He is ald wasted cadaverous barely alive He holds a
rough cross made of sticks in his bony hand His movernents such as they
are are dream-like and slow MAXIMUS stares down at the pitiful creature
HEPHAESTOS turns his head slowly and with great effort then looks up at
MAXIMUS his eyes deep and dim in their orbits
HEPHAESTOS
have been waiting for you

MAXIMUS kneels down beside HEPHAESTOS

HEPHAESTOS
feared you would not come

MAXIMUS opens his skin of water and puts it against HEPHAESTOS lips

MAXIMUS

HEPHAESTOS coughs back the water He closes his eyes He opens them

HEPHAESTOS
We are dyingwe godsfading from the
grand schemeit is for the better

HEPHAESTOS turns his head away and looks about him
HEPHAESTOS

They have deserted memy followersleft me

MAXIMUS nods

HEPHAESTOS
They lost faiththey fear death oblivion
tried to tell themhold true and the rewards
will bebeyond measure oh my children

HEPHAESTOS’ hand tightens around the cross and his voice drops to a
barely audible whisper MAXIMUS leans closer to hear him

HEPHAESTOS

isbutoneGod May He forgive all that we
have done

HEPHAESTOS moans horribly

HEPHAESTOS
Oh the rivers of bloodthe torrents of tears
MAXIMUS

great stormin his hand the nub of truth

MAXIMUS

HEPHAESTOS

MAXIMUS
Where is he What do you mean

HEPHAESTOS reaches out and with his skeletal claw grabs MAXIMUS and

pulls him close
HEPHAESTOS

Come will show you

HEPHAESTOS stares into MAXIMUS’ eyes clutching his rough cross

HEPHAESTOS
Help me Maximus

HEPHAESTOS arches his body suddenly stretches back his neck and
opens his mouth soundlessly

22 EXT TOWN SQUARE LYONS

MAXIMUS rises out of the body of a dying CHRISTIAN The CHRISTIAN is
arched backwards mouth open in a terrible scream a sword thrust
downward deep in his chest All about him CHRISTIANS are being
massacred by a mob of civilians and guards Some kneel some atternpt to
flee as they are clubbed and hacked to death by a frenzied mob Bodies
twist and shudder and spurt blood on the ground of the town square The air
is full of screams of pain and prayer MAXIMUS looks about him in horror
He sees at the centre of the mayhem an old man POLYTHNUS kneeling
in the dirt petitioning the heavens in prayer He holds a wooden cross
CHRISTIANS try to protect POLYTHNUS and are slain in the process

MAXIMUS is atiacked by the mob MAXIMUS draws the sword out of the
chest of the CHRISTIAN and begins fo hack a swathe through them With
great art he chops and swings at the blood-hungry mob
SEVERAL GUARDS bear down upon him THE GUARDS raise their swords
against MAXIMUS to deliver the deathblow A man LUCIUS (25 years
old) tall powerful virile pushes through the crowd on a large black stallion

LUCIUS
Wait

The GUARDS lower their swords and take hold of MAXIMUS LUCIUS
dismounts and walks towards MAXIMUS bloody sword in hand

LUCIUS

LUCIUS touches MAXIMUS’ breastplate with the tip of his sword

The crowd has quietened POLYTHNUS addresses the heavens clutching
his cross

LUCIUS
Do you threaten me
LUCIUS turns and walks away Seven paces eight

POLYTHNUS

LUCIUS turns then runs toward POLYTHNUS bringing down his sword and
with one mighty blow decapitates him He turns to MAXIMUS and the
GUARDS his Roman breastplate brindled in blood LUCIUS points his
sword at MAXIMUS

LUCIUS
Kall him

MAXIMUS head butts one GUARD disarms another brings the sword down
upon another A GUARD on a horse bears down upon MAXIMUS
MAXIMUS drags the GUARD from his horse mounts it and as the
CHRISTIANS scatter flees

basket In the basket is a silk cushion and on the cushion lies a tiny spider
monkey DECIUS sops a smal piece of bread in a bow of milk and tries to
feed the monkey The spider monkey is not well He does this with great
concentration LUCIUS enters DECIUS’ chamber He moves through the
room and stands before DECIUS

LUCIUS
Sire

DECIUS sops another piece of bread in the milk

DECIUS
Ah Lucius You have returned

LUCIUS
Yes Sire you sent for me

DECIUS continues to tend to the monkey

DECIUS
indeed did You must be worn out from all your
vigorous activity

LUCIUS
have only this evening arrived

DECIUS
Reports have come back from Lyons that concern
me somewhat Lucius believe my instructions
were that that you arrest the leaders and bring
them back to Rome It would appear your methods
were somewhat over-zealous

LUCIUS
My interpretation of your orders Sire was that
you wished the Christian movement quelled This
did

DECIUS looks up for the first time
DECIUS
Your interpretation of my orders hear you
painted the streets of Lyons in their blood

DECIUS examines LUCIUS LUCIUS stands tall

DECIUS
Still Lyons is Lyons and Rome is Rome

The monkey lets out a little squeak DECIUS looks back down and strokes

the monkeys head

DECIUS
Look at this poor thing It is blind and near
to death

LUCIUS
May speak plainly Sire

DECIUS
He barely breathes

LUCIUS
Sire the gods are vexed

DECIUS
With my monkey

UCIUS

The couniryside is devastated Plague famine
earthquakes the great granaries of Rome destroyed by
inundationshard is the anger of the gods

DECIUS
do not need to be told the condition of my Enipire

LUCIUS
These Christiansthese atheists mock the empire
and the divinity of the gods Sire They are disrupting
the order of things They must be put away

DECIUS
Your words Lucius are like a cracked bell They ring
untrue
LUCIUS
Sire

DECIUS
fear this is more personal

A knot of muscle works in LUCIUS’ jaw and his pale eyes narrow
DECIUS
Your dear mother Lucille did she not have certain
sympathies with these people

LUCIUS stung stiffens DECIUS strokes the monkey’s head

LUCIUS
fear for the empire Sire

ECIUS looks up at LUCIUS and leans back in his chair

DECIUS
Hear me Lucius As am sure you are aware
have posted an edict to the citizens of Rome On the
week of (date) each Roman family will be ordered
to make a sacrifice under law to the gods The
Jews of course will be exempt These Christians
believe this sacrifice to be an affront to their so-called
God They will not participate in the ritual They fear
some kind of efernal damnation This edict will
effectively expose the Christians A census will
be taken and a list drawn up Citizens not on the list
will be arrested and tried according to the law They
will be offered a chance to recant Those who do not
will be put to deathin the Coliseumthus Lucius the
gods will be appeasedthe laws will be upheldand
the people entertained

DECIUS moves forward and once again looks down at the monkey

DECIUS
After ail itis not as if these Christians are a
warring factionitis not as if they have risen up
against us

LUCIUS
Not yet Sire but their beliefs strike at the very
heart of all that is Rome
DECIUS
Beliefs And what are your beliefs Lucius

LUCIUS stands tall then nods toward the basket

LUCIUS
believe Sire that your monkey is dead

DECIUS peers closer into the basket

teaches us that violence begets violence And once it
begins there is no end to it

of the apostle Paul He brought down much
havoc on the Christians but on the road to
Damascus saw a blinding light and heard the voice
of Jesus He converted and became Christ’s
chosen instrument My father says that there is
often great anguish and vexation before one can
step from the darkness into the light and hear His
voice Are you touched by that story

with his pale eyes ONE OF THE GUARDS hands rests on the crank of a
winch
LUCIUS
Are you a spectre Maximus Moridius

MAXIMUS slowly draws his sword

MAXIMUS
Let us find out

LUCIUS’ eyes look up and move across the heavy chain of the hauling
device the pulleys and the counterweight LUCIUS’ eyes alight on JUBA
who stands at the other end of the forge his hands bound the chain around
his neck He is gagged His face has been beaten JUBA looks at MAXIMUS
his eyes wide

LUCIUS
Move one step closer and my guard will
release the lever Your friend’s neck will
snap like a twig Now put up your sword

LUCIUS moves a step closer

LUCIUS

MAXIMUS
Release him He is not part of this

LUCIUS
You must understand gladiator have to take
precautions You are well versed in the art of
killing © how you used to swing that sword

MAXIMUS
You will die will see to that

LUCIUS
Perhaps But not this day

MAXIMUS
What do you want
LUCIUS
Forgive me Maximus but am confused about

many things As a boyas a little boy1 watched
a Roman General who became a gladiator bring

down the very heavens upon his foes And when he
died I stood by my mother and we wept and all of
Rome wept with us He was a soldier a great
warrior Yet he stands before me now How can
that be

MAXIMUS

Do not despair You will see the heavens come
tumbling down again

LUCIUS waves his hand dismissively and smiles almost sadly

LUCIUS
But am further confused Not only does this
manstand before me now but he forges an
alliance with a sect of infidels whose beliefs defy
all that he has ever fought for mean Maximus
we are fightersyou and we are warriors Roman
warriors Again am much perturbed

MAXIMUS
knew your mother well She was a good woman it
would appear that she gave birth to a snake

Again LUCIUS waves away MAXIMUS’ retort

LUCIUS
A good woman yesbut a vulnerable one After
youdied Maximus she lost heart She became
remotedistant They preyed on her these
Christians They lured her in They poured their
cup of poison into her ears filled her poor mind
with their foul notions of glory Glory through
martyrdom She was set upon by a mob and
stoned to death my good mother She knelt in
the dirt wrung her hands and flung her empty
prayers to the stars Meanwhile the mob tore her
asunder These fanatics that you abet that you protect
Maximus they cheered her on She worshiped you

LUCIUS smiles sadly

LUCIUS
As did L

MAXIMUS and LUCIUS stare at on another

LUCIUS
And what now Are we fated to do battle you
and I We who are so alike

MAXIMUS stares at LUCIUS
MAXIMUS

We are not alike And fate has no part in this
will see you againin this life

LUCIUS nods
LUCIUS
i think so
LUCIUS waves his hand
LUCIUS

Farewell Go to your friendghost

MAXIMUS moves across the room to JUBA He pulls the chain from JUBA’S
neck The winch crank spins the iron counterweight drops with an enormous
clang to the floor MAXIMUS unsheathes his sword and turns to face

LUCIUS and his GUARDS They are gone MAXIMUS unties JUBA’S hands
