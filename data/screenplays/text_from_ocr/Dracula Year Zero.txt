EXT TRANSYLVANIAN COUNTRYSIDE - CARPATHIAN RANGE - DAY 1
Ten armed men run through the white veins of a birch forest
THE CASTLE GUARD

Tracking quarry under the shadowed canopy of trees

SUPERTITLE Transylvania 1462 AD

Snatches of their LEADER as he races through shafts of
sunlight Jet-black hair Sweat on his brow Clouds
of breath in the crisp air

On his hip a sword in scabbard On his hand a SILVER
SIGNET RING bearing the symbol of a dragon

CLOSE ON A SILVER COIN glinting in the dirt
The Leader STOPS to examine it The coin’s stamped with a

king’s strong profile Though HIS FACE REMAINS IN SHADOW
his silhouette is the same as on the coin

PRINCE VLAD DRACULA

Ruler of Transylvania 30s A soldier’s frame He tosses
the coin to

DIMITRU

30s big as a bear He’s a Boyar member of the landed
gentry Lusty lovable ferocious in a fight And Vlad’s
closest friend

DIMITRU
(it doesn’t add up)
Gypsies snatch coin purses They
don’t steal a year’s worth of taxes
from your Royal Guard

VLAD
They did today

Vlad KEEPS MOVING driven Dimitru at his side plus
steadfast CAPTAIN PETRU and the rest of Vlad’s Castle Guard

FOLLOWING the Gypsies’ trail through dense oppressive
forest It glistens from a rainstorm that threatens to
return As they push INTO A CLEARING
BROKEN-TOOTH MOUNTAIN 2

Is revealed It rises above the trees like an angry god its
peak jagged as a crown of fangs Bruise-yellow STORM CLOUDS
hover strangely over the peak

DIMITRU
(with dread)
They’re headed to Broken-Tooth

Vlad’s men HALT giving in to their fears Vlad REMAINS IN
SHADOW A cipher Dimitru nervously grips a CHARM inscribed
with ancient signs

VLAD
What is that

DIMITRU
Wards off evil

VLAD
Where did you get it

DIMITRU
(sheepish)
Bought it off a Gypsy Real
silver

Vlad dismissively examines the charm

VLAD
You were robbed

Dimitru snatches it back irritated

DIMITRU
(off the mountain)
Men who travel here past sunset
don’t come back

VLAD
I know all the stories I just
think they’re horseshit
(off the charm)
And that’s tin

Poor Dimitru regards his charm with buyer’s remorse
DIMITRU
Your heart’s Transylvanian but you

didn’t grow up here This place is
not like other places

( )

VLAD
(challenging his men)
I need the money back now
EXT BROKEN-TOOTH MOUNTAIN - DAY 3

Alongside a surging RIVER GYPSIES pull the stolen WAGON
loaded with silver They’re tough outsiders garbed in
aggressive patterns

SHKELGIM
Senses something the way a long-lived rabbit feels the
shadow of a hawk He’s the Gypsy Chief Crafty Face

weathered by wind and sun

He scans the surrounding forest The other Gypsies mutter
just as nervously here as the Castle Guard

SHKELGIM
(to his Men)
Hurry now

But as Shkelgim’s eyes dart to Broken-Tooth’s bleak crown
perhaps it’s not his pursuers he fears

VLAD

Steps from the woods INTO THE LIGHT Finally we see his face
clearly A man not to be crossed this day

VLAD
Stop

Shkelgim instead whips more speed from the horses heaving
the wagon closer to the mountain

Gypsies hang back at Shkelgim’s SHOUTED ORDER spreading out
to stop their pursuers Defiantly unsheathing swords

VLAD (contd)
Alright then

Vlad and his men throw themselves at the Gypsies

Three BOLD GYPSIES pin Vlad between them Vlad meets their
blades parrying fast

Vlad gets in close throws punches and elbows A nose
shatters a jaw breaks Two Bold Gypsies fall

The Third THRUSTS at Vlad --

( )
3

Vlad twists The sword skims his side Vlad catches the
Gypsy’s arm and WRENCHES it

Dimitru’s sword-stroke misses a Gypsy hits a tree instead
and is STUCK FAST in the wood FOUR GYPSIES surround Vlad’s
unarmed friend poised to kill

No time to think Vlad TOSSES Dimitru his own SWORD Now
armed Dimitru barrels into his attackers

Vlad targets the wagon across the sea of clamoring steel

Shkelgim surprisingly reins the fleeing wagon to a STOP
CUTS the horses free Throws his weight against the wagon

DIMITRU
What in God’s name is he doing

Vlad realizes the Gypsies are just stalling them

Shkelgim is trying to roll the wagon down the embankment
and dump the silver in the river

VLAD
Son of a whore

Shkelgim sees Vlad coming full bore Gives one last shove to
get the wagon WHEELS TURNING

Shkelgim draws a DAGGER on Vlad Vlad grabs Shkelgim’s wrist
and forces the blade IN THE WHEEL’S SPOKES to stop it --

The blade SNAPS as the wagon lumbers TOWARD THE RIVER’S EDGE
Vlad throws Shkelgim to the dirt gets a hand on the wagon --
The wagon’s weight drags Vlad He digs in his heels
Slows it but the front wheels slip OFF THE EDGE OF THE
EMBANKMENT The wagon teeters precariously

Veins popping Vlad heaves back with all his might Stops
the wagon in time staving off disaster

The beaten Gypsies surrender Vlad grabs Shkelgim’s collar

VLAD (contd)
Are you insane

SHKELGIM

I had a dream This is what I must
do

( ) 3

VLAD
Dump my taxes in the water

SHKELGIM
Dam the river with silver To
prevent what is to come

DIMITRU
(worried)
What is to come

SHKELGIM
Dead men who rise from their graves
at night and hunt til dawn
compels them back

VLAD
(orders his men)
Bind him
SHKELGIM

I dreamt of a foolish man who will
free this evil from the mountain
and poison all the earth --

Vlad presses the broken knife to Shkelgim’s throat

VLAD
You put my kingdom at risk for
this

SHKELGIM

If you’re going to kill me Id
like a moment to pray

VLAD
The punishment for stealing is
twenty lashes
Vlad lowers the knife Dimitru begins BINDING Shkelgim

Shkelgim INTONES threatening words in an ancient tongue

Dimitru and Vlad’s men back away petrified it might be some
Gypsy curse

Vlad PUNCHES Shkelgim across the jaw Glares at his men
Point made he finishes tying Shkelgim’s binds himself

VLAD (contd)
Make it nineteen lashes

( ) 3

Vlad selects a thin branch with some bend to it Cuts it and
prunes it into a wicked-looking switch Vlad’s men rip open
the back of Shkelgim’s garments to expose the skin

Vlad brings the switch down on Shkelgim’s back raising a raw
red stripe The Gypsy CRIES OUT in pain

VLAD (contd)
Eighteen

Vlad WHIPS Shkelgim again and again As Vlad metes out his
justice the SUN SETS

VLAD (contd)
(finishes to Shkelgim)
Now go home

SHKELGIM
Please Prince You don’t know
what you’re doing Only the purity
of silver can hurt him Nothing
unclean can touch it

Shade eclipses the mountain

Vlad sees a vague SHADOW across the river Vlad squints
another Gypsy Then it’s gone

VLAD
(calling out)
You --
DIMITRU
(scared to Vlad)
Don’t

Vlad ignores him CROSSES THE RIVER bounding from rock to
rock

AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN Vlad cranes around searching
in the failing light He can’t hear anything over the
white-noise RUSH of the river

Vlad’s boot kicks something A HELMET He recognizes the
finely wrought Arabic inlay

TURKISH WEAPONS are scattered everywhere A battalions
worth of ARMOR peeled off and shredded Evidence of total
massacre

But there are no bodies

( ) 3

Vlad RETURNS Tosses the helmet to Dimitru There’s a HOLE
in it the size of a man’s screaming mouth Looks bitten
straight through

VLAD
Turkish scouts What were they
doing here

DIMITRU
(crossing himself)
They didn’t know the stories

Dimitru fearfully regards the sky

DIMITRU (contd)
It’s getting dark

A MIST slips down from Broken-Tooth on a cold wind This
mist has an odd red tint

It exhales across the river engulfing them all Vlad
touches the moisture left on his face It’s BLOOD RED

Vlad finds this odd -- his men think it terrifying wiping
the red sheen from their skin in horror

SHKELGIM
(a final warning)
All the swords in your kingdom
could not stop him

Vlad turns to his jittery men

VLAD
We got what we came for

SHKELGIM
(head bowed)

Mother-of-us-all forgive me I

failed
Vlad’s boot clinks the helmet He looks down at the gnawed
bite in its Turkish steel Wondering just for a moment if
the stories could be true
The dusky face of Broken-Tooth DISSOLVES into
EXT CASTLE DRACULA - CITY OF TIRGOVISTE - DAY 4

A great stone slab of unadorned defense Reflected ina
pond it quavers like a dream

( )
4

Easter Morning sun casts Vlad’s castle in gold It towers
over the capital city of TIRGOVISTE tucked against the
foothills of the Carpathian Mountains The city is a jumble
of angled roofs punctuated by church steeples

INT BEDROOM - CASTLE DRACULA - DAY 5
Vlad ENTERS his room brooding
MIRENA

Sits up in bed Vlad’s wife the Princess Early 20s raven
hair a tiny IVORY CRUCIFIX around her neck Usually a
bright brassy spirit right now she’s tired She didn’t
sleep either

MIRENA
I can always tell when the Turk tax
collectors are due There’s an
empty place in bed

VLAD
I’m usually not chasing down Gypsy
thieves

MIRENA

You got the silver back

VLAD
(nods then)
And if I hadn’t

Lost in memories that give him no peace he peels off his
clothes Vlad’s body is etched with scrapes from the
Gypsies and deeper older battle scars

MIRENA
You’re home For almost as many
years now as you were with them

Vlad flops back on the bed exhausted Mirena pulls him
right back up

MIRENA (cont’d)
We have to get dressed It may be
tax day in Turkey but here it’s
still Easter
(off Vlad’s look)
Easter Remember When our Lord
Christ rose from the dead

With a roguish glint Vlad scoops Mirena in his arms

( )

VLAD
How long do you need

Vlad and Mirena embrace in long lingering kisses
INT BEDROOM - CASTLE DRACULA - LATER 6

Mirena dresses quickly donning the elaborate raiment the day
requires Smiling and flushed

Vlads already decked in his princely attire He ENTERS the
adjacent room

INT INGERAS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS 7
A matronly GOVERNESS dresses
INGERAS

Vlad and Mirena’s six year-old son (pronounced “In-je-rash”)
He chafes against being dressed like a doll A losing battle
he’s been unwilling to concede for years

INGERAS
(to his Governess)
I can do it you know

VLAD
I know

The Governess bows and withdraws so Vlad can finish buttoning
his son’s jacket himself

INGERAS
(to Vlad)
It’s not any better if you do it

VLAD
Do you know what the word
“responsibility” means

INGERAS
Wearing itchy clothes

VLAD
Doing things you don’t want because
it’s important
Vlad combs a knot out of Ingeras’ hair
INGERAS

I dreamed I had a pie And then I
ate my dream Ow --

( )

7

VLAD

Was it good
INGERAS

Very good
VLAD

Did you save a piece for me
INGERAS

(cheerily)

No

Buttoned in Ingeras pulls at his tight collar Vlad
similarly stretches shoulders constrained by his own fine
jacket United in their discomfort

VLAD
(a twinkle in his eye)
Let’s leave and go riding Skip
the whole feast

Ingeras judiciously weighs this option He wants to be a
good Prince like the father he idolizes

INGERAS
I think we should go to the feast

VLAD
Later then

Vlad offers his hand for Ingeras to take

INGERAS
Later

It’s a deal Ingeras’ small hand fits comfortably into his
father’s And we see this warrior undone by love for his
son

INT THRONE ROOM - CASTLE DRACULA - DAY 8

Vlad sits on his throne Framed by muscular architecture of
polished BLACK LIMESTONE

A PEASANT SHEPHERD and his 15 year old son MIHAI kneel before
Vlad

PEASANT SHEPHERD
I tried to fight them off but
the wolves ate all my flock Now
I’m afraid I can’t put enough food
on our table

( )

8

VLAD
(thinks for a moment)
My advisor could use a good valet

CAZAN

Nods graciously 50s the Prince’s advisor wise and direct
Afflicted with a withered hand and club foot he relies ona
CANE Cazan loves Vlad like a son a love Vlad returns But
ultimately Cazan is iron-bound by his duty to Transylvania

PEASANT SHEPHERD
Thank you Prince

The Peasant Shepherd hugs his son and is escorted OUT

CAZAN
That is the fifth valet you’ve
hired for me today

VLAD
Youll have very shiny boots

CAZAN
Your father made me shine my own

VLAD
I’m not him

A PRIEST and a THIEF in chains are brought in The Priest is
well-fed in rich satin the Thief in rags

PRIEST
Prince Gods blessings on you
Our new church is magnificent

Vlad gestures for him to continue

PRIEST (contd)
(points at the thief)
He stole from the altar

The Priest dramatically presents a CHALICE as evidence Vlad
is unmoved

VLAD
The punishment for stealing a man’s
property is twenty lashes

PRIEST
(persisting)
But he did not steal from a man
He stole from God

( ) 8
VLAD
God will get his own chance to
judge him
PRIEST

He desecrated our church This man
deserves to die

VLAD
You may have his life but you
have to take it yourself

PRIEST
Me

Vlad rises drawing a DAGGER from his belt He presses the
blade in the hands of the flustered Priest

VLAD
(points at the Thief)
Strike fast here in the heart Or
cut him in the gut if you want him
to linger
The Priest looks at the dagger and feels sick

VLAD (contd)
Or he could be lashed twenty times

Rattled the Priest nods accepting Vlad’s sentence The
Priest and Thief are LED AWAY

Vlad sees Cazan appraising him amused

VLAD (contd)
What

CAZAN
You could have just said no

VLAD
I’m hungry lLet’s eat

Cazan FOLLOWS Vlad out an open archway into
A GREAT HALL

Wrapped with a starkly painted row of towering PORTRAITS
They are Vlad’s ancestors the line of Transylvanian Princes

Today the hall is filled with the noisy hum of drinking and
revelry Transylvanian CITIZENS sit at long tables Some
rich some humble all enjoying a FEAST

( ) 8

SNOWFLAKES float down alighting on the obsidian walls
melting to shiny droplets We might think this odd
Arent we indoors

The roof has been taken off the throne room It’s open to
the slate-gray spring sky Everyone exposed to heaven as
equals

The Prince’s arrival fills the hall with excited buzz

Vlad glad-hands a row of RELIGIOUS LEADERS in velvet robes
then faces a starkly different sort of Man of God

BROTHER LUCIAN

Bows in gratitude 50s a monk wearing a simple cossack in
contrast to the Archbishop’s pomp His body bent under the
weight of his knowledge starved in the quest for it

VLAD (contd)
Lucian The construction went
well

BROTHER LUCIAN
Your generosity has been without
peer Truly God will welcome you
into Heaven for all of the homes
youve built for Him on earth

Vlad earnestly clasps Brother Lucian’s hand

VLAD
That’s not why I’m doing it

MIRENA

Stands in a circle of LADIES engaged in polite small talk
Ingeras at the center

From Ingeras’ point of view he’s surrounded by a gaggle of
overstuffed hens enduring an onslaught of pinched cheeks and
oohs and ahhs and a chorus of My-how-he’s-grown-into-a-
spitting-image-of-his-father

Mirena catches sight of Vlad working the room with effortless
skill

He shares a toast of something brackish and strong with some

SOLDIERS who’d die for him Listens intently to the
concerns of CRAFTSMEN practitioners of honest professions

( ) 8

MIRENA
(interrupts Vlad low)
The toads are pouting on their log

She nudges Vlad toward
THE BOYARS

The wealthy landowners of the ruling class each draped in
tailored furs Eating at their own table Frowning

ON VLAD This is the part of the job he least enjoys

AT THE BOYARS’ TABLE an IRRITATED BOYAR brushes snow from
his plate of lamb

IRRITATED BOYAR
(grumbling)
What was wrong with the roof
Doesnt he know spring in
Tirgoviste is colder than winter

SIMION “THE WISE”

Answers 50s oily charm The richest and highest ranking
Boyar

SIMION “THE WISE”
It’s to make us feel like peasants

Vlad glides up Puts on the fraternal airs of the nobility
One of the boys

VLAD
No It makes them feel like you

Boyars nod amongst themselves now appreciating his
strategy Except Simion smiling thinly the only one not
buying Vlad’s act But there’s no advantage to making waves

Instead Simion raises his cup and bows with a flourish

SIMION “THE WISE”

(to the whole room)
To ten years of peace and
prosperity since our Prince came
back to us To twenty more each
one richer than the last

(to Ingeras)
And above all to the young Prince

Ingeras’ cheeks burn under everyone’s gaze Hoping he’s
making a suitably princely expression

( ) 8

Everyone raises their cups in resounding support of Vlad
All except Dimitru who snores through the toast Head
tilted back drunk

Vlad finds his seat next to Mirena

The Passion Play BEGINS A small children’s CHOIR sings
ACTORS portray Christ’s death and resurrection

Ingeras is seated in front of his parents He properly
observes the proceedings with stoic willpower

Mirena notes that it’s Vlad who’s fussing in his chair

MIRENA
(leaning into Vlad’s ear)
You might take a lesson from your
son and learn to sit still

VLAD
(off the Passion Play)
I know how it ends
(beat suspicious)
What did you bribe him with

MIRENA
It gives him great joy to obey his
Queen You should try it

VLAD
Toy horse

MIRENA
(admitting)
A snake A real one

Vlad’s impressed

VLAD
Youre less squeamish than I
thought

MIRENA

I’m the most proper lady you’1l
ever know

Vlad LAUGHS kisses her on the forehead
A DOZEN TURKISH SOLDIERS 9

March into the Hall as if they owned the place The Turks
wear turbans Uniforms colored in brilliant hues

( )

9
The crowd MURMURS The Castle Guards are uneasy
Vlad shares a fraught look with Mirena Ingeras isn’t used
to seeing his father nervous like this -- it puts the boy on
edge
HAMZA BEY
Approaches Vlad Emissary of the Turks A delicate bearing
flush with arrogance He speaks in SUBTITLED TURKISH
designated by italics
HAMZA BEY
(in Turkish)
Is there a single fly in your
country that does not bite

Vlad chooses to answer Hamza Bey in English

VLAD
I hope your journey was safe

HAMZA BEY
(in English)
Sultan Mehmed the Second offers his
salutations to you and your son
Vlad does his best to mask his anxiety

VLAD
Thank him for his sentiment

Hamza Bey’s SUBORDINATE finishes counting the silver nods

VLAD (contd)
Now take it and leave

But Hamza Bey does not leave Instead he unfolds a MAP

HAMZA BEY
Greater tribute is required

Red dots indicate a patchwork of sites across Transylvania
HAMZA BEY (contd)
Our soldiers will construct a chain
of aviaries for the Sultan’s
carrier pigeons
Cazan shoots a shocked look at Vlad
CAZAN

Carrier pigeons

( ) 9

VLAD
The fastest way for troops to
communicate is by air

Vlad knew this day would come

VLAD (contd)
Mehmed is invading Europe

HAMZA BEY
The Danube is a road and it flows
past your door It brought Caesar
and Charlemagne Khan and
Alexander It is your fate to bea
pebble on the road of conquerors
But the Sultan need not concern
himself with a pebble if it stays
out of his boot

VLAD
Mehmed has no enemies here

HAMZA BEY
Did you think we would not notice a
battalion of our scouts missing for
days

Hamza Bey points to Broken-Tooth on the map Vlad steadies
himself

VLAD
I didn’t kill them

Hamza Bey doesn’t bother arguing the point

HAMZA BEY
There is one last thing
(announcing to the crowd)
The Sultan requires one thousand
boys to join his Janissary Corps

VLAD
(blindsided)
Janissaries You abandoned this
practice years ago

HAMZA BEY
The Sultan needs soldiers

A JANISSARY stalks through the feast wearing a distinctive
uniform that sets him apart from the Turks

BRIGHT-EYES

( ) 9

Appraises BOYS with a baby-blue stare that could pierce lead
Blond and powerful himself plucked as a child froma
Christian land Raised to be a ruthless warrior loyal only
to the Sultan

HAMZA BEY (contd)
Those age fifteen will fight in
Hungary Those from ten to
fourteen will be made ready for the
siege on Vienna

A fire rages inside Vlad

HAMZA BEY (contd)
I do not expect disobedience Did
not your own father give you up
without a fight

VLAD
I was no Janissary I was a royal
hostage

HAMZA BEY

You may have been raised under the
Sultan’s roof but you fought for
us just the same

This is news to Ingeras His father grew up with these
people

Bright-Eyes inspects a RED-HAIRED BOY like livestock

BRIGHT-EYES
Soft but they will do

The BOY’S FATHER grabs Bright-Eyes’ sleeve --

Bright-Eyes KILLS the Boy’s Father with a single stroke of
his scimitar

Vlad’s people cower Dimitru and the Castle Guard watch
helplessly No one dares make a move against the Turks

Bright-Eyes takes the Red-Haired Boy’s arm
BRIGHT-EYES (contd)
(to Hamza Bey)
I should take him now This boy
needs a father

Vlad catches the boy’s scared eyes

( ) 9

Vlad moves the Red-Haired Boy safely behind him and into the
arms of a VILLAGE ELDER

Bright-Eyes drops his hand to his scimitar
Vlad speaks to Bright-Eyes in flawless TURKISH

VLAD
You know who I am

Bright-Eyes hesitates He knows
HAMZA BEY
You are losing your accent Prince
You almost sound Transylvanian

Hamza Bey waves off Bright-Eyes diffusing the situation

HAMZA BEY (contd)
A thousand boys in two weeks

Vlad stiffens as if a blade were pressed to his throat
HAMZA BEY (contd)
You do not want the Sultan

disappointed upon his arrival

The Turks LEAVE Shaken Peasants embrace their sons
Mirena is stricken

Vlad looks as if he’s standing on a gallows Cazan puts a
hand on his shoulder

CAZAN
Listen to me Courage Anger
Love Especially love None of

these matter for a prince They
will even lead him to ruin All
that matters is his duty to his
people

Vlad’s eyes linger on his FATHER’S PORTRAIT

VLAD
Is that how you advised my father

10 INT INGERAS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT 10
Vlad sits on the edge of Ingeras’ bed

INGERAS
We never went riding you know

( )

10

VLAD
We’ll go tomorrow

Ingeras is troubled He has something on his mind

INGERAS
You went to live with the Turks

VLAD
Yes
(choosing his words)
When two men fight sometimes to
make peace the loser will give
something to the winner Something
they think is valuable

INGERAS
How old were you

VLAD
A little younger than you

INGERAS
Were you there a long time

VLAD
When I came back I thought I was a
man I wasnt I had to meet your
mother for that

INGERAS
Were you scared

VLAD
(after a beat)
I wanted to make my father proud

Ingeras tries to process this

INGERAS
Are you proud of me

Vlad can see fear in his son’s eyes
VLAD
(reassuring)
That was another time You don’t
have anything to worry about

Vlad kisses him on the forehead and blows out the candle

INT CHAPEL - CASTLE DRACULA - NIGHT 11

Still of the night Icons of saints surround the crucified
Christ from floor to ceiling

Mirena prays alone a scarf covering her head There are no
pews in the Eastern Orthodox tradition one stands before
God

Vlad finds her here

MIRENA
Do you know what you’re going to
do
VLAD
(after a beat)
No
MIRENA
You would never give our son to the
Sultan
VLAD
No
MIRENA

Can you let him take the others

VLAD
If I don’t he’1ll kill a hundred for
every one I save
(tormented)
But you know what the Turks will
train those boys to do

Vlad struggles to keep his memories bottled up

MIRENA
I know what you’ve told me

Mirena traces her fingers along Vlad’s back across the scars
hidden beneath

VLAD
How can you love me

MIRENA
I know your heart

Mirena searches for some answer

( )

11

MIRENA (cont’d)
You grew up with Mehmed

VLAD
There was a time he and I were like
brothers

MIRENA

Ask the Sultan to show mercy

VLAD
He has no use for mercy

MIRENA
Then ask God

Vlad snorts

MIRENA (cont’d)
(persisting)
Some questions can’t be answered by
men Or even clever wives Some
questions are beyond us

VLAD
I didnt know my father was giving
me to the Turks until they stepped
off their boat I hid in a chapel
by the river and prayed for six
hours before they dragged me away

Vlad extinguishes a candle with his thumb and forefinger

VLAD (contd)
What has God ever done for me

MIRENA
He gave you a son

Mirena EXITS leaving Vlad alone

Vlad stands before God without an ounce of humility Lowers
his eyes to the crucifix with its bloody tormented Christ

VLAD
(to the Christ icon)
You have my sympathies

But as Vlad focuses on the Christ Icon he sees his face
reflected in the gold foil circle haloing the crown of
thorns

Vlad realizes he found his answer after all

INT BEDROOM - CASTLE DRACULA - DAY 12
Mirena helps Vlad strap on his BREASTPLATE

MIRENA
What if you don’t come back

VLAD
(wiping away her tears)
I will

Vlad holds her face in his hands Memorizing the line of her
chin the curve of her lips Fixing her in his mind forever

Ingeras ENTERS Sees armored Vlad from behind For a
second he’s taken aback

VLAD (contd)
(to Ingeras)
It’s me It’s armor

MIRENA
He’s just never seen you in it
before

Ingeras thinks he knows why this is happening That it’s his
fault

INGERAS
Are you leaving because of me

Vlad hugs his son Using every ounce of will to contain his
emotion

VLAD
I need you to look after your
mother
EXT SULTAN’S TENT - DANUBE RIVER - DAY 13

Vlad ARRIVES at the SULTAN’S TENT on the DANUBE SHORE
accompanied by Dimitru Cazan and a few of his Castle Guards

The canvas peaks of the Sultan’s Tent mimic Turkish minarets
Gilded leather shines like jewels

IN THE FAR DISTANCE the river has sprouted a hazy forest of
crimson and turquoise They’re SAILS atop masts rippling in
the wind

Mehmed’s mighty FLEET is coming Countless warships weighted
with legions

( )

13

Awe reverberates through Vlad’s men

DIMITRU
The whole world will be Turk

GENERAL OMER
Approaches Vlad 60s Supreme Commander of all Mehmed’s
armies Shrewd and unflinching he fears nothing but the
wrath of God The one man whose counsel the Sultan trusts
GENERAL OMER
(sizing up Vlad)
Kaziglu Bey You are a man full
grown

VLAD
And you Omer are a man grown old

General Omer cracks a thin smile
GENERAL OMER

He is eager to see you It is all

he has been talking about for days

Vlad Cazan and Dimitru are escorted to the Tent

Mehmed’s GENERALS murmur amongst themselves as they eye Vlad
with hard-won respect Kaziglu Bey Kaziglu Bey

GUARDS part fabric doors for them to ENTER
DIMITRU
(to Vlad)
What are they saying “Kaziglu
Bey”
INT SULTAN’S TENT - CONTINUOUS 14
SULTAN MEHMED THE SECOND

Sits before them in a sumptuously embroidered interior
Clad in golden armor Vlad’s age Radiating power

MEHMED
Do your own people not know you
Have you not told them your name

VLAD
I left that name behind

( )

MEHMED
Well perhaps like many things
Turk it is restless and refuses to
stay put
(gestures to a table)

Sit We will drink coffee together

as we did when we were boys

Mehmed pours thick Turkish coffee Vlad takes a sip

VLAD
Just as it should be Black as
hell strong as death

MEHMED
(finishes the proverb in
English)
And sweet as love

VLAD
I think your prophet himself once
said blessed be he who conquers
Constantinople A prize sought for
a thousand years -- and you brought
down its walls in fifty four days

Mehmed nods graciously at the compliment

MEHMED

Europe is child’s play compared to
it Those foolish kings will still
be plotting against one another
while I raise my flag over their
heads

(beat)
I miss the time we spent arguing
whether such a thing were possible

VLAD
All I miss from my time with you is
the coffee

Mehmed smiles understanding

MEHMED
My father’s palace was cruel for a
young boy alone far from home
But soon you talked like us
Dreamed like us Fought like us
And fight that you did better than
most

(sips his coffee)
(MORE)

( ) 14
MEHMED (contd)
So I am owed one thousand boys
Why have I not seen them

VLAD
Because you can’t have them

Mehmed raises a curious eyebrow
Vlad takes a knee before the Sultan and offers his sword

VLAD (contd)
I’m worth a thousand boys I’1l1 go
with you to Europe I’11 fight as
your servant
(beat)
Just leave my people be

Mehmed savors Vlad’s offer Mehmed’s Generals REMARK
excitedly Vlad looks as if he’s relinquished his soul

MEHMED
Those kings would tremble if they
knew
(turns to Dimitru)
Do you want to know why we call
your prince Kaziglu Bey

Vlad goes rigid

MEHMED (cont’d)
My father sent young Vlad to serve
his Vizier in Greece Unruly
Greece It was an insult to the
Vizier -- this Transylvanian pup
come to help him So the Vizier
gave him a handful of soldiers and
sent him to the fiercest village
With orders to kill every man
woman and child It was an
impossible task A death sentence

Mehmed watches Vlad squirm at the telling of the tale

MEHMED (cont’d)
But the Transylvanian pup did not
die He impaled them all as is
the Turkish way Eight hundred so
they say And I believe it

(his favorite part)

Only young Vlad believed this
punishment alone would solve
nothing So he impaled the Vizier
as well

(MORE)

( )

14 14
MEHMED (contd)

He sent word to all the villages

you have had your blood for blood

Now bow to the Sultan and live in

peace And they did

(after a beat to Dimitru)
Kaziglu Bey It means “Lord
Impaler”

Dimitru is thunderstruck Cazan knew

MEHMED (cont’d)
They were women and children You
found a way to do what we could
not

VLAD
(impatient)
Then accept my offer

MEHMED

When we were boys I longed for the
day you would fight at my side

(leaning back)
But now I am Sultan What need
have I for one more soldier
I count my soldiers by armies My
enemies by nations And you not at
all

VLAD
(rising apprehension)
You know I’m more than a soldier --
Mehmed scoffs at the audacity
MEHMED
I will have that thousand boys

And one more

Vlad feels the strength drain from his bones as General Omer
unrolls a PARCHMENT detailing the terms

MEHMED (cont’d)
Your son will be raised under my
roof just as you were raised under
the roof of my father
Mehmed gestures to
GENERAL ISMAIL
Young with a cruel mouth and dead eyes Eager for his

Sultan’s approval

( )

14 14

MEHMED (cont’d)
(to Vlad)
You will stay on your throne but
General Ismail will remain To see
my wishes fulfilled

Mehmed cuts his thumb with a ceremonial BLADE Presses his
thumb to the parchment Leaving his mark in BLOOD

VLAD
(in Turkish)
Please
MEHMED

What is one son If you are virile
enough you will make more

15 EXT DANUBE PLAIN —- DAY 15

Vlad waits A wreck It’s a deserted place away from farms
and villages From a distance he watches

Mirena and Ingeras ARRIVE with Cazan
INGERAS
(to Cazan)
Why did Papa tell you to bring us
here

Cazan lies

CAZAN
I don’t know

MIRENA
(to Ingeras)
It must be important

Vlad APPROACHES Mirena didnt think she’d ever see him
again

Between his wife’s unflagging trust and his son’s innocent
confusion Vlad feels ill

Cazan catches Vlad’s eye to give him the strength he needs

DOWN THE ROAD Hamza Bey and six brawny TURKISH SOLDIERS draw

near

ON MIRENA All at once she realizes the unthinkable is
happening

( )

15 15

MIRENA (cont’d)
(to Vlad)
You promised this wouldn’t happen

CAZAN
(to Mirena off Vlad)
He shouldnt have

MIRENA
(desperate to Vlad)
The day you asked for my hand do
you remember what I said

VLAD
You said no

MIRENA
I knew what happens to the sons of
the Queen You said things would
be different You said if I loved
you I should trust you
(raw)
I love you

Hamza Bey ARRIVES The two groups face off separated by
twenty paces Vlad goes to meet him Hamza Bey presents the
parchment

HAMZA BEY
Sign the terms

Vlad numbly CUTS HIS FINGER Imprints the parchment

Mirena backs away pulling Ingeras with her

MIRENA
(to Vlad)
How many have you killed for no

reason
(off Ingeras)
Now you have one

Ingeras looks back and forth between his parents mirroring
their emotion getting more and more upset

CAZAN
(easy to the Turks)
Everything is fine
(steady to Vlad)
Peace can’t be bought cheaply

MIRENA
He’s our son

( )

15 15

CAZAN
(to Mirena keeping his
voice down)
It would start a war

MIRENA
(loud to Vlad)
So start it

INGERAS
Ill go

Vlad stares at his son Gutted
MIRENA
(to Ingeras)

What are you saying

INGERAS
I can do it

Ingeras holds out his hand for his father to take Vlad
can’t respond But he does take his son’s hand

Mirena gives in to despair

Vlad approaches Hamza Bey with Ingeras each step heavier
than the last

INGERAS (cont’d)
You’re proud of me aren’t you

VLAD
(voice catching)
Of course I am
HAMZA BEY
There is no shame in this It is
the way of the world
Time to say goodbye Ingeras’ eyes meet his father’s
Vlad recognizes his son’s fear

Hamza Bey reaches out to receive the boy

ON VLAD No This is not the way of the world Not
anymore

Vlad TURNS HIS BACK on Hamza Bey

Ingeras is confused as Vlad takes him by the hand back toward
Mirena

( )

15 15

CAZAN
(to Vlad)
Don’t

HAMZA BEY
I will not allow my Sultan to be
disappointed

The Turks’ hands SLIDE TO THE HILTS OF THEIR SWORDS

Vlad gives Ingeras back to his mother Tears stream down
Mirena’s face but it’s not relief She knows what’s going
to happen next

VLAD
(to Mirena off Ingeras)
Don’t watch

Hamza Bey and the six Turks CLOSE IN on Vlad SWORDS DRAWN --
Vlad DRAWS HIS OWN and strikes --

Mirena LOOKS AWAY shielding Ingeras with her breast before
Vlad’s sword hits its target She HEARS Hamza Beys final
scream

CLOSE ON MIRENA AND INGERAS Her eyes shut tight his
covered They might not be watching but they can’t help but
HEAR the CLASH of swords The terrible sound of BLADE
MEETING FLESH The CRIES of men dying

Then all is quiet save the sound of one man breathing hard
Mirena DARES TO LOOK

The Turks of the delegation lie DEAD Vlad stands over them
with a well-used sword chest heaving

VLAD (contd)
It’s not a child’s place to save
his country It’s the
responsibility of men
Mirena is stunned by Vlad’s darkness yet thankful for it
Vlad locks eyes with her They’re in this together
INGERAS
(agitated)
What happened

Vlad puts a hand on his son’s head

( ) 15

VLAD
You didn’t do anything wrong

Cazan shoves the parchment into Vlad’s hand Everything he
has built destroyed

CAZAN
Mehmed will punish all Transylvania
for what you’ve done

ON VLAD Mind churning His gaze wanders across his land
Time seems frozen

His eyes land on far-off BROKEN-TOOTH MOUNTAIN The
unnatural halo of clouds at its peak churn restlessly

As Vlad focuses on it the sounds of nature fall away to
SILENCE An impossible idea forming

VLAD
Whatever haunts Broken-Tooth I
know it kills Turks

Vlad embraces both Mirena and their son He kisses her
roughly desperately

Vlad unclasps the SILVER CHAIN from Mirena’s neck Gives her
back the crucifix He keeps the chain balls it in his fist

VLAD (contd)
Get to the castle They’ll be
marching soon

EXT BROKEN-TOOTH MOUNTAIN - DAY 16

Vlad HIKES a steep trail up Broken-Tooth through unforgiving
stone Clouds smudge the peak smothering it in shadow

Vlad sees a DOOR high up on the mountain’s jagged summit An
ancient narrow STAIRCASE wraps up the sheer cliff Off
the edge of the stairs is a long fall straight to the RIVER

Vlad girds himself draws his sword and CLIMBS
INT ROMAN TEMPLE - DAY 17

Vlad ENTERS sword first Heads down a tunnel into murky
half-light

The space opens up into a mad warp of beautiful decay
Fleshy white MARBLE somehow folded like skin vast as a
cathedral Swirling quasi-organic columns rise as if woven
from what

( )

17

The vaulted ceiling is a writhing canopy are they BATS
And are those WOLVES lurking on the periphery

Vlad can make out STATUES sunk into the marble as if it were
melting wax Or perhaps the marble has been slowly creeping
up to consume them for a thousand years

Every statue is of the same person the beatific face of a
youthful Roman man

Vlad can’t make out the NAME chiseled in the base He
tries to scrape aside the white muck

Vlad hears SOMETHING APPROACH Braces for an attack back
against a column

Vlad feels the breath of the damned on his ear LOOKS UP --
RED EYES A blur of movement -- then BLACKNESS

INT ROMAN TEMPLE - LATER 18
Vlad OPENS HIS EYES

lad is UPSIDE DOWN hung from the ceiling by a chain around

is ankles Like meat hung to drain Below him the floor
s warped into TROUGHS stained black over the centuries

bp

Vlad struggles but his arms are bound His armor is gone
along with his sword

He sees VICTIMS hanging from the ceiling beside him --
Peasants Gypsies even some unlucky TURKS Most are
bloodless corpses but a few are STILL ALIVE

Vlad tries to keep his head think

A FIGURE IN A GOLDEN MASK

RISES from the floor as the marble unnaturally stretches
into a translucent membrane draping the Figure

Vlad realizes with horror the membrane is skin white as the
belly of a fish The Figure’s MASK bears the same frozen
FACE as the statues

The Masked Figure lazily WALKS amongst the hanging bodies
Pauses before an UNCONSCIOUS TURK

THE MASKED FIGURE
Wake up

( )

18

The Masked Figure rouses the Turk with a cold touch to his
cheek The Turk flails much to the Masked Figure’s delight

THE MASKED FIGURE (contd)
Better

Hanging bodies OBSCURE Vlad’s view of what happens next
The Masked Figure SLICES a sharp FINGERNAIL across the Turk’s
THROAT Vlad HEARS LIQUID DRAINING into the trough beneath
him

Vlad’s guts go cold

The Masked Figure MOVES DOWN THE ROW heading toward
Vlad

VLAD
I’m prince of this land

The Masked Figure doesn’t even look up

THE MASKED FIGURE
What land is that

VLAD
Here to the banks of the Danube

THE MASKED FIGURE
Oh Is that all

The Masked Figure slices another Turk down the line moving
closer Vlad fights to keep his nerve

VLAD
These soldiers are my enemies

THE MASKED FIGURE

(chuckles )
Ah No they will not bother you
again
The Masked Figure is almost upon him Vlad’s eyes land on

the INSCRIPTION carved in the statues
VLAD
“Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus”
Impossible

Truth dawning Vlad fights to keep his nerve He now
understands all the identical statues

( ) 18

VLAD (contd)
(to himself)
You were known for your vanity

Suddenly the Masked Figure is a breath away pressing a
sharp nail to Vlad’s jugular

THE MASKED FIGURE
I was famed for my beauty

VLAD
You are the Emperor Caligula

For this is the Masked Roman’s true name
CALIGULA
(intrigued)
How am I remembered

Vlad hesitates before answering

VLAD
As the greatest of the Caesars

Caligula doesn’t respond The chilling milky-fleshed thing
merely stares at him through his gleaming golden mask

Vlad swallows hard

CALIGULA
(finally)
You lie I murdered friends I
debased my enemies I spilled the

blood of thousands
Vlad had better think fast
VLAD
(flattering)
But now you are a god with powers
that rival Jove himself
Caligula proudly sets his shoulders
CALIGULA
You are as wise as you are pleasing
to the eye
Caligula RELEASES Vlad Vlad tumbles to the ground
Caligula reclines on his THRONE gestures to a bejeweled

GOBLET by a VAT What drained through the trough has been
collected here

( )

18 18

CALIGULA (cont’d)
Fill my cup Quickly while it’s
still warm

Vlad beats back his revulsion scoops the goblet into the
dark liquid

CALIGULA (cont’d)
Most men blunder here But you
strode up like a proud billy-goat

VLAD
I want you to kill my enemies

CALIGULA

(imagining the glory)
Ah the thought of it Armies
falling at my feet like ripe
fruit

(after a beat bitterly)
But I’m trapped on this unworthy
mountain

VLAD
I was told a man could free you

Caligula’s red eyes narrow WVlad’s crossed some line

CALIGULA
You were told wrong

ON VLAD To think he chased a Gypsy’s dream He knows now
this was folly

CALIGULA (cont’d)
I have my own war For a thousand
years I’ve fought the Light

A rumble of THUNDER As Caligula grows angry the storm
rages more violently outside Vlad spots his sword lying
discarded on the floor too far

CALIGULA (cont’d)
(shouts up at the heavens)
You burn me You see fit to judge
me in Your glare But I will not
lay down

Vlad realizes Caligula’s addressing God Almighty himself

VLAD
Does “The Light” ever answer you

( )

18 18

CALIGULA
It insults me with Its silence

VLAD
(after a beat)
We have that much in common

CALIGULA
But the Darkness it never stops
whispering

Despite the danger Vlad’s drawn by an irresistible need to
know

VLAD
What does it say

CALIGULA
Drink

Caligula snaps for the goblet Vlad hands it to him
Caligula REMOVES HIS MASK and puts the goblet to his lips

Vlad sees CALIGULA’S FACE Corrupted No longer human
FANGS jut from his jaw

Vlad can’t help his reaction He stumbles back sickened

CALIGULA (cont’d)
I repulse you

Caligula stands furious His eye catches a statue
celebrating his former beauty

CALIGULA (cont’d)
(to the statue)
Stop laughing
Caligula pulverizes his marble face with his BARE FIST
-then SWATS Vlad across the room

Vlad holds his ribs sees his sword now within reach
Caligula STALKS TOWARD him

Caligula BARES HIS FANGS --

Vlad grabs his sword and SLASHES Caligula’s chest before he
can bite --

Caligula merely laughs Vlad watches in amazement as
Caligula’s wound HEALS

( ) 18

Vlad STRIKES AGAIN burying his blade TO THE HILT -- so deep
the SILVER SIGNET RING on his fist presses Caligula’s flesh

This time Caligula HOWLS IN PAIN The ring BURNS his skin
leaving a scalded IMPRINT behind

CALIGULA (cont’d)
You dare bring silver into my
temple

Caligula grips Vlad’s wrist Snaps up a PAIR OF TONGS and
pulls the ring OFF Vlad’s finger as if it were molten hot

Vlad YANKS free Runs for his life

Vlad hears leathery FLUTTERING behind him An ivory-white
BAT in pursuit

ON VLAD He stops Running isn’t the answer He reaches
into his pocket and finds Mirena’s SILVER NECKLACE

The Bat DISSOLVES into a SMOKY MEDIUM REFORMING as
Caligula His mouth an awful fanged thing

In a blur Caligula SLASHES Vlad with his nails
CALIGULA (contd)
(whispers in Vlad’s ear)

I’1l let the spiders drink it

But Caligula should not have gotten so close Vlad throws
the silver chain over Caliqula’s head

Caligula SCREAMS in agony Vlad gets behind him and tightens
the chain around Caligula’s neck like a garrotte

Caligula falls to his knees clawing at the searing chain

Vlad puts a foot between Caligula’s shoulder blades and
PULLS The silver SLICES into his throat Caligula SQUEALS

VLAD
How do I get your power

Larynx severed Caligula laughs with a gurgling rasp

CALIGULA
You

Vlad winds the chain tighter ignoring the pain in his gut
VLAD

How

( ) 18

Vlad keeps PULLING Caligula is afraid now The chain
burned HALFWAY THROUGH his neck

CALIGULA
Drink

Vlad braces his boot against Caligula’s back and gives the
chain a sharp jerk --

SEVERS Caligula’s head Caligula’s headless body twitches

Vlad stares into the spreading puddle of Caligula’s midnight-
black BLOOD

Vlad cups the black blood in his hands and DRINKS
Shuddering as the noxious liquid courses through him

Vlad picks up his SIGNET RING puts it on

The sound of STONE SCRAPING STONE
THE UN-DEAD 19

Push aside the lids of what must be COFFINS and RISE from the
dirt within Once Roman soldiers senators and their wives
Now Caligula’s Brood

They look in dismay at Caligula their fallen master then
turn their red eyes to his killer

Vlad backs up as they SURROUND HIM
The Brood doesn’t attack Instead they KNEEL reverently

CALIGULA’S HEAD
You think you’ve won

Caligula’s Head SPEAKS Mouth twitching in a half-smirk

CALIGULAS HEAD (contd)
Youre their king now

The Un-Dead Brood begins to DIG A GRAVE in the dirt Clawing
with their bare hands

CALIGULA’S HEAD (contd)
You are dying Little Prince You
will be buried And the earth you
should rot in will be your
prison as it is ours No matter
how far we stray at night at dawn
our graves call us back We can
never be free

( )

19

Vlad can feel Caligula’s blood POISONING him He’ll be
dead soon

CALIGULAS HEAD (contd)
You’11 rule nothing but this
mountain Worshipped by dumb
beasts Endlessly pining for the
glory you left behind
ON VLAD defiant even as his life slips away
VLAD
I won’t be like you I won’t be
trapped I won’t be buried in
dirt
Caligula’s Head cackles It’s impossible

CALIGULA’S HEAD
All dead men have graves

VLAD
Drowned sailors don’t

Caligula’s Head twists in rage Vlad has outfoxed him

CALIGULA’S HEAD
No --

Vlad steps over Caligula’s head as he STAGGERS

OUTSIDE

He looks over the edge of the dizzyingly SHEER DROP

ANGLE TO REVEAL THE RIVER far below at the Mountain’s base

The Un-Dead Brood reaches from the doorway to stop Vlad
But the SUNLIGHT sears their fingers Keeping them at bay

With his last bit of strength Vlad lets himself FALL off the

mountain
VLAD HITS THE WATER 20
His body is SWEPT ALONG by the RIVER

---and carried past the ruts dug in the shore where Shkelgim

failed to dam the river with silver

The river bears Vlad away from Broken-Tooth Shkelgim’s fear
realized Vlad was the man from the Gypsy’s dream and what
was locked up has now been set free

( )

20

ANGLE BENEATH VLAD looking up from underwater Vlad floats
face down He is dead

INT SULTAN’S TENT - SUNRISE 21

Mehmed watches the sun rise General Ismail ENTERS flush
with anticipation

GENERAL ISMAIL
All night we have waited yet Hamza
Bey has not returned

Mehmed finishes his coffee Sets the cup down with a clink
MEHMED

Now at least your time in this shit

heap will not be dull
INT BEDROOM - CASTLE DRACULA - DAY 22
Vlad’s cheek rests on his pillow He looks into Mirena’s
eyes Bodies together wrapped in a sheet They’ve just
made love
It’s uncommonly quiet in the castle No sounds to disturb
their reverie No past behind them No future waiting
Only now here together
SUNLIGHT from an open window needles Vlad’s eye Mirena
holds up her hand to shade him Vlad weaves his fingers into
hers Backlit by the sun their hands blush red at the
edges

CLOSE ON THEIR HANDS The light behind grows BRIGHTER The
blood beneath the skin glows hotter

Hotter
A wisp of SMOKE issues from Vlad’s finger
EXT FOREST STREAM - DUSK 23

Vlad’s corpse is face down in the stream caught on rocks
The corpse rolls over His eyes OPEN red and inhuman

Vlad’s silver ring BURNS HIS FINGER He bares newly grown
FANGS as he claws it off

Vlad is disoriented and thirsty He drinks from the
stream but spits out the water as if it were poison

Vlad catches sight of his REFLECTION and recoils a monster
stares back He touches his fangs unbelieving

( )

23

Vlad’s thoughts focus The world looks different Sharper

He remembers what he’s done and why Vlad retrieves his
Signet ring from the stream bed

Vlad hangs the ring around his neck by a leather cord His
tunic provides some protection from its painfully hot touch

Vlad notices the VILLAGE ELDER behind him Vlad hides his
face under the hood of his cloak

VLAD
Don’t be afraid

VILLAGE ELDER
(oddly unconcerned)
What is there to be afraid of
Vlad hears a rhythmic POUNDING

VLAD
The Turks are close

VILLAGE ELDER
They’ve been in the village for
hours

VLAD
I can hear their drums

VILLAGE ELDER
What drums

EXT PEASANT VILLAGE - DUSK 24

Vlad passes smoldering homes the air polluted with smoke
The ever-present DRUMMING in his ears

Vlad sees jumbled bodies littering the ground His people
slain by the Turks

Vlad is brought to his knees by the sight

VLAD
Forgive me

The Village Elder stares at Vlad accusingly

As Vlad walks amongst the corpses he finds the Village
Elder’s body among them

Vlad turns confused to the “Village Elder” standing behind
him The man is A GHOST

( )

24

VLAD (contd)
Youre dead

VILLAGE ELDER
So are you
(beat)
Feast on them devil
The Ghost of the Village Elder VANISHES into the air
Vlad hears the DRUMMING getting louder
A TURKISH CAPTAIN spots Vlad whose face remains CONCEALED
under his hood The Captain commands a DETACHMENT of
Ismail’s Army
TURKISH CAPTAIN
(to his men)
We missed one

Vlad realizes with a shock that the DRUMMING he hears is
actually the Turks’ HEARTBEATS

The Turks ENCIRCLE VLAD One stalks toward him LAUGHING
Vlad picks up a SWORD from the ground

LAUGHING TURK
At least this one isn’t begging

Vlad SILENCES the Laughing Turk with his blade

Vlad fixates on the BLOOD staining his sword

A GUST OF WIND blows out of nowhere as the Turks gird
themselves against this intruder who has proven to be no

farmer

Vlad clenches the ring in his fist The silver BURNS The
pain SILENCES the heartbeats The wind dies down

The Turks ATTACK Vlad all at once Vlad cuts down two
three but a fourth BURIES his sword in Vlad’s chest --

Vlad staggers back then grins realizing it doesn’t even
hurt Vlad watches the wound HEAL

Vlad flips back his hood The Turks gasp They see skin
like a ghost fangs like a demon They RUN

A few Turks desperately turn on Vlad with their spears
Vlad is shoved backward along with an UNLUCKY TURK --

INTO THE VILLAGE WELL 25
A long fall INTO THE WATER Vlad treads water looking up

High above the Turks strain to push a MILLSTONE weighing
tons over the well’s mouth Trapping Vlad

It’s PITCH DARK but Vlad can still see through his new
eyes Sees the Unlucky Turk scrambling blindly to get away
but unable to get a handhold on the slippery stone walls

Vlad touches the walls finds a grip where no mortal could

Vlad CLIMBS the well’s sheer stone lizard-like amazed at
his ability

IN THE VILLAGE SQUARE 26

The Turkish Captain wipes his brow relieved when he hears
the giant millstone PUSHED ASIDE from within

Through fire and smoke he sees a nightmarish vision of Vlad
as he EMERGES from the well

Vlad stalks toward the quaking Turkish Captain Seizes him
by the throat --

Vlad hears the Captain’s heart POUND the rush of blood so
tempting Vlad opens his jaws

TURKISH CAPTAIN
A demon

Vlad grips his ring Resists the thirst

VLAD
I’m still the Prince

Vlad SLAYS the Turkish Captain with a swing of his sword
EXT PEASANT VILLAGE - LATER 27

Vlad scabbards his sword satisfied these Turks will no
longer harm his people He senses something behind him --

An OLD WOMAN

Holds up a frail hand to defend herself looking fearfully at
Vlad She’s small of stature and gaunt as a bag of bones

OLD WOMAN
Don’t hurt me devil

( )

27

Vlad covers his monstrous face with his hood

VLAD
I’m not a devil

Vlad touches the Old Woman to reassure himself she’s real

OLD WOMAN
(slyly off his touch)
And she is not a ghost
(kindly)
She has come to help He is a foul
thing A drinker of blood

She knows what he has become
VLAD
I won’t be like those things
Drinking blood like rats
Vlad hears an odd SCRATCHING SOUND

A strange COTTAGE now stands behind him Steep roofs stacked
on steep roofs

OLD WOMAN
She can end his thirst This wish
she can grant

VLAD
Why should I believe you

OLD WOMAN
He has a little berry Ingeras he
calls it It is a tasty name

ON VLAD He finds himself oddly swayed by her words as she
pries at his greatest fear He grips his silver ring

VLAD
I would never hurt him

But Vlad does not sound convinced

OLD WOMAN
Then wish it

VLAD
I wish I no longer desired
blood
The Old Woman snaps a bit of firewood -- making a short
sharp STAKE PRICKS Vlad’s finger with the POINT

( ) 27

The Old Woman ENTERS the cottage Concocts a POTION using
the stake to stir it WVlad’s BLOOD mingling with
unknowable ingredients

Vlad warily accepts a cup of the potion and DRINKS it
down Feels an ache in his heart but nothing more

VLAD (contd)
I’m still thirsty

The Old Woman LEAPS at Vlad jamming the wooden stake at
Vlads breast --

OLD WOMAN
He must die

Vlad GRABS the stake just in time The point HOVERS over his
heart just grazing his chest

It hurts Vlad to the core It shouldn’t but it does
Vlad grapples with the Old Woman who is SUPERNATURALLY

TRONG She gnashes her teeth in anger -- TEETH made of
sharp IRON

n

Vlad wrenches the wooden stake from the Old Woman’s hands

VLAD
What have you done to me

OLD WOMAN
As he wished He is changed Now
if his heart is pierced with wood
his thirst will end

VLAD
I didn’t ask to be killed

OLD WOMAN
His thirst can end no other way

Vlad notices something inside her cottage a dirty CAGE
strewn with tiny bones He’s aghast

VLAD
You eat children

OLD WOMAN
So will he
(hisses)
She has seen it

Her eyes roll back white as she relives her vision

( ) 27

OLD WOMAN (contd)
He is the one who escaped the
mountain He is the one who walks
unbound by any grave She will
starve because his hunger will
never end

Vlad realizes who this Old Woman is

VLAD
My nursemaid told me tales of you
A witch named Baba Yaga who gives
three wishes to any man who asks
(realizes)
You owe me two more

Baba Yaga grinds her iron teeth and pulls her hair
Despairing at what she has inadvertently made possible

BABA YAGA
No no no She is a stupid old
crone Wishes are for punishing
the weakness of men

VLAD
Then you shouldn’t have started
this
(beat)
I wish I could defeat my enemies
without spilling so much blood

Baba Yaga grudgingly produces A SKULL Flames dance in the
eye sockets from a lighted CANDLE inside

BABA YAGA
He looks into their eyes He takes
their fire for his own He will
bend the will of foe and friend

Vlad stares into the skull sockets As he concentrates
the flames are EXTINGUISHED then RE-LIT in his eyes

Vlad looks down at his corrupted bone-white hands as he
contemplates his final wish

VLAD
I wish they could see me as I was

Baba Yaga blows a HANDFUL OF POWDER at Vlad
BABA YAGA

He shines He speaks music
He wraps himself in glamour

( ) 27

Vlad himself TRANSFORMS back to the face he was born with
He sees his HANDS are now rosy A flawless illusion

But Vlad sees WILDFLOWERS wilting at his feet

VLAD
More tricks

BABA YAGA
Nature cannot be deceived It sees
the truth and shuns him For it is
a plague he brings

VLAD
The Turks are the plague

BABA YAGA
(a final appeal)
He has not yet savored the blood of
men so he may yet be a man again

VLAD
I still have things to do

BABA YAGA
He has just seven days

VLAD
Seven is enough

Baba Yaga STEPS IN the doorway of her cottage as it MOVES
AWAY We see the cottage rides on hundreds of CHICKEN
FEET SCRATCHING like the tiny legs of a millipede

BABA YAGA
Each day will be harder than the
last And one taste of blood will
set your fate in stone

INT HALL - CASTLE DRACULA - DAY 28
What sounds like a THUNDERCLAP shakes the castle --

Dimitru and Simion pick their way through air choked with
dust

DIMITRU
I never imagined cannons could be
that big

SIMION “THE WISE”

That’s probably what the poor
bastards in Constantinople thought

( )

28

Castle Dracula is under siege The hall is a scene of panic

A few BOYARS have taken refuge along with what’s left of
Vlad’s meager CASTLE GUARD Some SERVANTS as well mostly
women and their children Nobility and peasant cower as
equals in a union of fear

Mirena holds Ingeras to calm them both Grim Cazan sits
nearby tension between him and his queen

They hear another cannonball HIT Followed by a third
EXPLOSION The great castle GATE can’t withstand much more
of this

Ingeras holds his hands over his ears Simion glares at
him

SIMION “THE WISE” (cont’d)
Well all die now For him

DIMITRU
Show respect or I’ll string you up
by your tongue

SIMION “THE WISE”
And the Prince’s respect for us

She has no answer

EXT TURKISH CAMP - OUTSIDE CASTLE DRACULA - SUNSET 29
SMOKE clears

Three GIANT TURKISH CANNONS are aimed at the castle gate
The CHIEF CANNONEER steps away from their red-hot barrels
He inverts an HOURGLASS They will take hours to cool
Ismail’s CONTINGENT OF SOLDIERS settles in to wait A small
force by Turkish standards -- just sixty or so men Such is

their contempt for the Transylvanian will to fight

General Ismail and a few Officers eat at a well-set outdoor
table Chatting indifferent to the tableau of ruin

VLAD 30

Watches HIDDEN IN SHADOW Red eyes radiating fury He
ventures a fingertip into diminishing DAYLIGHT It BURNS

VLAD
(eyes on Ismail)
Night’s coming soon

AT THE PERIMETER OF THE TURKISH CAMP 31

A SQUAD OF TURKS patrol unnerved by the distant HOWL of
wolves

Their LEADER trips -- finds it is the CORPSE of one of their
own a KNIFE through his heart The knife bears Vlad’s
distinctive DRAGON emblem

SQUAD LEADER
It is the symbol of their Prince

A SHADOW passes over the Leader who looks up in fear at the
figure standing over him

ELSEWHERE IN THE TURKISH CAMP 32

A tough VETERAN eats an APPLE A YOUNG SOLDIER holds his
lance tight peering into the dark News travels fast

YOUNG TURKISH SOLDIER
An entire squad How does one man
slit the throats of an entire
squad

The FLUTTER OF BATS overhead distracts the Veteran He
takes another bite of apple --

VETERAN TURKISH SOLDIER
(goading)
Maybe this place is haunted

The Veteran SPITS out the food gagging The apple has
impossibly become ROTTEN

The Veteran sees that the Young Soldier standing next to him
just a moment ago is GONE

INT ISMAIL’S TENT - NIGHT 33
General Ismail angrily berates a frightened SUBORDINATE

GENERAL ISMAIL
Find who is doing this

The Subordinate SCURRIES OFF leaving General Ismail alone
VLAD

Ismail

Ismail feels a jolt of terror as Vlad unfolds from the gloom

Vlad’s EYES shimmer with MESMERIZING fire Ismail’s PUPILS
DULL as Vlad’s will carves into his brain

VLAD (contd)
I have some new orders for you

INT HALL - CASTLE DRACULA - NIGHT 34

In the hall impending death weighs on everyone Some pray
Some weep Some are angry

Mirena wets a WOUNDED MAN’S lips with WINE He gazes
adoringly up at her

MIRENA

I hope you like it It’s from the

Prince’s private stock

Ingeras sleeps His Governess smiles sadly at Mirena
GOVERNESS
(off the Wounded Man)
A pretty girl does more for him
than any drink of wine

Outside the broken gate someone approaches A hush falls

Mirena can’t see what’s happening Is it Turks It can’t
be people aren’t reacting right

It’s Vlad

He peels back his hood to reveal HIS FACE restored to normal
by the witch’s magic

People press toward their prince as if he alone might deliver
them from evil

Vlad anxiously searches out his wife Mirena throws
herself into his arms Vlad hugs her and doesn’t let go

VLAD
I lost the chain

MIRENA
It wasn’t the important part

Mirena touches her crucifix now hanging from a silken cord

( )

34

Vlad sees Ingeras curled up next to his Governess He
hesitates scared to touch his sleeping son Smiling at the
Governess he covers it well

VLAD
Let him sleep

Vlad meets everyone’s expectant eyes He gathers himself

VLAD (contd)
(addressing the people)
They wanted my son A good prince
would have given him up A good
prince would have kept the peace
(catches Cazan’s eye)
I’m sorry I failed you

Everyone is silent Despair hangs heavy as a shroud
VLAD (contd)
But we can still beat those Turks

out there

Simion gestures derisively around the hall Barely a dozen
Transylvanians able to wield a sword

SIMION “THE WISE”
Theres five of them for every one

of us

VLAD
Together you’re stronger than all
of them

People BUZZ unsure

VLAD (contd)
Your heart is one heart Your
hands are one hand

Vlad can feel the people’s emotion rising

VLAD (contd)
Make your hand a fist Let your
fist grip a sword Follow me out
that gate and the Danube will be
so stained with Turkish blood that
the Black Sea will turn red

mischievously toward the Turkish ranks

VLAD (contd)
Just watch
EXT OUTSIDE CASTLE DRACULA - NIGHT 35

Ismail’s Turks surround the castle gate

-yet as we scan their faces we see Vlad’s campaign of
terror has taken its toll

AT THE CANNONS General Ismail lurks Eyes glassy His mind
not his own

Chains squeal as the castle gate OPENS Battered iron and
oak rises as

VLAD LEADS THE CHARGE

Running headlong out of the castle -- straight at the black
barrels of Mehmed’s mighty guns It seems like madness

Turkish CANNONEERS light their fuses --

Under Vlad’s spell General Ismail HACKS at a cannon’s WINCH
ROPES with a knife --

CHIEF CANNONEER
General no

General Ismail KILLS the Chief Cannoneer without thinking --
The cannon barrel DROPS burying itself in the dirt --

The cannon FIRES point blank into the earth and BLOWS UP

The explosion OVERTURNS the cannon beside it like a toy
SHRAPNEL rips through the Cannoneers

SMOKE billows Vlad sees

The LAST CANNON its fuse is still burning Aimed at him

The Cannon SHOOTS IMPACTS just feet in front of Vlad --
Enveloping him in a FIERY CLOUD

Vlad EMERGES from the smoke UNHARMED Storming toward the
Turkish line

Vlad’s men shout inspired by their Prince and CHARGE
behind him

But the Turks see something else something the
Transylvanians do not

( )

35

The MOUNTAIN behind the castle MOVES Its rocky landscape
shifts as if breathing Its cliffs OPEN UP

It’s not a mountain anymore Two vast BAT WINGS unfold
revealing the visage of Vlad as a giant DEMONIC CREATURE

The mountain-sized Vlad-Demon looks down at the insignificant
Turkish Soldiers and stretches its great wings casting a
terrible shadow over the whole land

The Vlad-Demon is a nightmare hallucination conjured for the
Turks’ eyes alone Terror spreads

Vlad and the Transylvanians hit the Turkish line --

The Turks’ nerve is shattered Their line BREAKS

TIGHT ON VLAD Furiously POWERING through his enemies All
FALL beneath his scything blade

ON CAZAN He watches Vlad kill Sees Vlad’s unquenchable
desire to slay every single man who dares fight under the
Sultan’s banner

EXT OUTSIDE CASTLE DRACULA - LATER - PRE-DAWN 36
Victory Smoke from the ruptured cannons hangs heavy
Most Turks lay dead the rest have fled into the fields

beyond Tirgoviste

Vlad’s Fighters raise their weapons exultant Not a single
man was lost

Vlad can’t tear his eyes off the BLOOD painting his sword

CAZAN
A remarkable victory You proved
me wrong

VLAD

It was all of us
But Vlad sees Cazan appraising him the way he does

CAZAN
When they tried to take away your
son the way you killed them
there was something in your eyes I
hadn’t seen since I brought you
back from the Turks Something I
hoped I’d never see again

( )

36 36

VLAD
Look It’s me
(puts an arm around Cazan)
What do you advise me to do

CAZAN
Kill as many Turks as you need to
Not as many as you want to

37 INT HALL - CASTLE DRACULA - PRE-DAWN 37

Mirena looks for Vlad among the women embracing brave sons
and husbands

Mihai bumps Mirena as he runs past (He’s the boy whose
father Vlad hired to be Cazan’s valet)

MIHAT
(bows mortified)
Pardon me my lady

MIRENA
(smiles)
So pardoned

Vlad APPROACHES Mihai’s overwhelmed by the Prince’s
attention

VLAD
Where’s your father

MIHAT
He was outside the castle when the
Turks came
(voice catching)
Next time I want to fight with you

Vlad doesn’t let Mihai see the sadness he feels at the boy’s
father’s death Instead he leans close conspiratorially

VLAD
I’m going teach every one of my
soldiers to speak Turkish

Vlad says a PHRASE IN TURKISH Mihai repeats it with pride

MIHATI
What does it mean

Vlad WHISPERS the translation to Mihai who LAUGHS at the

obscenity forgetting his loss for a moment Mirena’s heard
this particular insult before

( )

37

MIRENA
I pity the Sultan’s mother

Vlad watches Mihai RUN OFF Mirena sees the cost of war
written on Vlad’s face

INGERAS
Papa

Ingeras bounds toward Vlad In his eyes his father is a
returning hero Normally Vlad would love nothing more than
to embrace him But now he eyes Ingeras with trepidation
knowing what he’s become

VLAD
My hands are dirty

MIRENA
He doesn’t care

Vlad has no choice as Ingeras flings himself into his
father’s arms

As Vlad holds Ingeras close he can hear the TAPPING of his
son’s heart

and catches their REFLECTION in an ornate MIRROR on the
wall

Bone-white flesh stares back at him Red eyes Fangs It’s
him This vile thing hugging Ingeras

ON MIRENA She notices Vlad’s horrified expression But
from her point of view her husband -- and his mirror double --
are their usual handsome selves

MIRENA (cont’d)
What’s wrong

Vlad realizes only he can see the truth

He presses Ingeras back in Mirena’s arms The boy’s hurt
It’s unlike Vlad not to shower him with affection

VLAD
We can’t stay here

Vlad glances outside Dawn threatens
VLAD (contd)

Be ready to move by sunset We’1l
travel by night

Mehmed stands at a table studying maps of Vienna’s defenses

General Omer ENTERS and hands him a message

GENERAL OMER
Word from Tirgoviste

ON MEHMED reading Anger cold as the Danube in December

MEHMED
My old brother
(to General Omer)
This land must be secured

General Omer measures his response carefully
GENERAL OMER

Sultan this scrap of dirt is not
worthy

Mehmed looks west Toward Europe Toward his future

MEHMED
You cannot leave those behind you

MEHMED
I prefer to write it myself

EXT CLIFFS ABOVE TIRGOVISTE - EVENING

Vlad Dimitru and Simion stand on a precipice high above
Tirgoviste An eagle’s eye view of the Transylvanian plains

The TORCHES of MEHMED’S ARMY For now just pinpoints of

light snaking toward them

Simion is sick with fear Even Dimitru can’t hide his

misgivings

SIMION “THE WISE”
What have we done

VLAD
Let’s get moving

( )

SIMION “THE WISE”
Where Your castle was our
stoutest defense and it couldn’t
stand up to a fraction of that

DIMITRU

We can fight the way our great-
grandfathers fought the Magyar
horde Use the forests and
mountains to strike and hide
Chisel away at them one at a time

(hopeful)
Six months of that and --

VLAD
Not six months I’m going to win
this war in six days

That gets a reaction

VLAD (contd)
I’m taking my family to Cozia
Monastery You’re welcome to come

SIMION “THE WISE”
To pray

VLAD

I had Cozia’s walls built thick
enough to defend against a siege
I expanded the caves stocked them
with enough grain for weeks The
Borgo Pass narrows to a choke point
there

(hard)
Well beat him the same way we beat
Ismail

Dimitru marvels at the Prince’s foresight

DIMITRU
This is why you’ve been so generous
building monasteries

VLAD
How pious do you think I am

EXT COZIA MONASTERY - BORGO PASS - EVENING 40

An isolated stronghold nestled amongst steep cliffs

INT MONASTERY HALL - EVENING 41

Austere stone An assembly of MONKS break bread The
front door SWINGS OPEN --

Brother Lucian ENTERS from the road His body’s tired from
hard travel but his focus is sharp

BROTHER LUCIAN
God tests every age The great
test of ours has come

The Monks gather around him as he eats ravenous

YOUNG MONK
News of the war has already reached
us We’ve been praying for swift
victory over the Turks

BROTHER LUCIAN
Wars come and go They are a part
of God’s plan
(beat)
What we face now is the Devil’s

That scares the Monks Lucian does not speak lightly

BROTHER LUCIAN (cont‘d)

I have been crisscrossing the
land The whispers and signs are
unmistakable What was long
imprisoned on Broken-Tooth has been
set free

(grim)
We must be ready

EXT FOREST - NIGHT 42
A band that fled Vlad’s castle hikes through woods a bright
MOON lighting their way Noblemen and Servants Guards and
Mothers young and old

Vlad guides them keeping his distance from Ingeras He
looks back at his son who’s trying to keep pace among the
adults

Vlad sighs He can’t keep his distance any longer

Vlad swings Ingeras up onto his shoulders Ingeras beams

VLAD
(grunts from the effort)
I don’t remember you being this
heavy

INGERAS
Then we’ll take turns

Vlad and Mirena share a laugh

Within earshot lame Cazan makes an effort to keep pace with
Dimitru

DIMITRU
I can toss you over my shoulder

CAZAN
I’m not a sack of turnips

Simion slips dirtying his silken sleeves

SIMION “THE WISE”
And worse it gets

Vlad glances back at his tired people

VLAD
(to Ingeras)
Someday this will all be your
problem

I think it is now

Vlad BACKTRACKS down the trudging line of people urging them
on his son on his shoulders

And lighten the men’s loads We
will be marching fast

EXT CAMPSITE - NIGHT 44

TENTS are pitched Vlad’s weary people eat around a few
campfires

Ingeras plays chase with Mihai The children’s energy
indefatigable despite the circumstances

Vlad finds Cazan sitting by a fire rubbing his sore legs
VLAD
They’re not soldiers Even the
ones that think they are
Vlad warms his hands He feels unusually cold
VLAD (contd)
Well sleep through the day and
continue tomorrow night
GYPSY WAGONS can be seen in the distance
CAZAN
The Gypsies are leaving Looks

like every one of them to a man

VLAD
Good riddance

CAZAN
What are they afraid of The Turks
only care about us
Vlad lets the question hang

Youre practically sitting in the

Vlad and Mirena kiss as they pull each other’s clothes off

They fall on a bed of furs People can be heard milling
about the campsite through the tent’s thin canvas walls

MIRENA
Shhh

VLAD
I’1l be quiet Can you

Vlad pulls her into a kiss Trying to smother his fears
Then Vlad hears Mirena’s HEARTBEAT Growing louder
Vlad abruptly stops

MIRENA
What is it

Vlad gets up quickly pulling on his clothes Clutches the
ring around his neck Mirena’s heart HAMMERING in his ears

MIRENA (cont’d)
Where are you going

Mirena reaches out to him

VLAD
Get the hell away from me

Vlad’s words land like a slap in the face Shocking them
both Vlad EXITS the tent fast

EXT FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT 46

Vlad LEAVES CAMP to escape the unrelenting HEARTBEATS of the
living Struggling to keep control

A sudden WIND tugs at his clothes Treetops sway
Vlad glances SKYWARD The same unnatural CLOUDS that
crowned Broken-Tooth now float overhead The weather mirrors

Vlad’s ferocious thirst

Nearly silent WHOOSHES as BATS flit through the branches
joining him

But Vlad focuses his attention on a shadowed stand of trees
where he sees something we can’t

VLAD
Don’t think I havent noticed you
following me

SHKELGIM creeps into the moonlight Vlad is stunned by how
he’s changed

( )

46

The once-commanding Gypsy is dishevelled Hollow-cheeked
Erratic Possessed by some inner fire that’s consuming him

Shkelgim unsheathes a DAGGER

SHKELGIM
I hear the whispers on the wind
The one who escaped the mountain
hides behind the face of a man

VLAD
Then you should know a knife wont
do you any good

But Shkelgim CUTS the palm of his OWN HAND Making a fist
he squeezes his blood into a rusty CUP

SHKELGIM
There is only so far on this earth
I can run

The temptation of hot spilled blood makes Vlad shiver

SHKELGIM (contd)
and it is not far enough

Shkelgim offers the cup to Vlad It seems insane to Vlad
Repugnant

SHKELGIM (contd)
Let me serve you

Vlad SLAPS the cup from Shkelgim’s hand Throws the Gypsy
against a tree

VLAD
Get away from me

Shkelgim BOWS low

SHKELGIM
Yes master

Shkelgim SCURRIES OFF into the night
ON VLAD Shaken by Shkelgim’s worship shaken by everything

Gray light before dawn Vlad RETURNS to camp Everyone is
fast asleep Quiet but for the tents whipping in the wind

( )

47

Vlad grips his SILVER SIGNET RING in his fist It BURNS TO
THE BONE Pain is the price to keep his thirst in check
It’s only getting harder

But for now the silver serves its purpose Vlad’s thirst
calms The wind dies The odd clouds disperse

Vlad joins Dimitru who’s alert perched on A RISE They both
survey the vast sweep of the land

DAWN has already reached Tirgoviste So has Mehmed

VLAD
(to Mehmed)
You left your cannons behind
DIMITRU
He’s coming faster than you

thought
Vlad’s troubled brow confirms it

VLAD
(off the tents)
We can only let them rest a couple
hours then we have to keep moving

Vlad can see distant mountain peaks already lit by the RISING
SUN It hurts his eyes

DIMITRU
(pinches Vlad’s cheek)
Youve lost your color When was
the last time you slept

EXT FIELDS OUTSIDE TIRGOVISTE - MORNING 48

Mehmed leads his Army marching to DRUMBEAT double-time The
armored juggernaut covers ground fast

Mehmed finds a TERRORIZED TURK wandering the fields outside
Vlad’s castle

TERRORIZED TURK
(rambling)
He has the devil’s face He has
the devil’s face and cannot die

Mehmed and General Omer share a look of alarm The

Terrorized Turk and a couple scattered others are the last
remnants of GENERAL ISMAIL’S FORCES

( )

48

MEHMED
The men should not see this

Mehmed and Omer RIDE AHEAD
They find General Ismail slumped on the ground

MEHMED (cont’d)
Stand to address me Ismail

General Ismail looks up eyes wild

GENERAL ISMAIL
A message from Prince Vlad
(as if possessed)
I can still recall the summer
nights in Adrianople The smell of
jasmine from the gardens The
air like a kiss

Mehmed looks at Ismail with confusion

GENERAL ISMAIL (contd)

I remember one night a terrible
thunderstorm came off the desert
Id known storms -- thunder shakes
these mountains every other day
But you you were terrified

(stares Mehmed down)
Tell me do you still cry when
youre scared

Mehmed draws his sword and KILLS General Ismail on the spot

MEHMED
(to General Omer)
Do the same to the others Fear is
a sickness I will not have it
spread

GENERAL OMER
I will tell the executioners they
are containing an outbreak of
plague

Mehmed can read General Omer’s face
MEHMED

You also think their Prince has
become a demon

( )

48 48

GENERAL OMER
(reluctantly)
Ismail was not prone to fantasy

MEHMED
As a young man I was invited to
dine at the table of Uzun Hasan
when he was King of Persia A
magician performed at the feast
He summoned a cobra from thin air
before my eyes Truly wondrous

It is clear that to this day it still amazes him

MEHMED (cont’d)
It was meant to kill me of course

GENERAL OMER
How did you survive

MEHMED
I pinned its tail with my fork
And cut off its head with my knife
(beat)
Sorcery is no match for steel
Mehmed turns to
BRIGHT-EYES who takes a knee before his master
MEHMED (cont’d)
They fled There will be women and
children moving slowly

FIVE MORE JANISSARIES stand behind Bright-Eyes as steely and
battle-hardened as he

MEHMED (cont’d)
You are the tip of my spear

49 INT TENT -— DAY 49

Vlad is feverish sleeping restlessly Alone in his own
tent Lost in delirium he doesn’t stir when

Mirena ENTERS She’s alarmed to see Vlad looking so ill
Mirena rubs a damp cloth over Vlad’s forehead She opens
his shirt to wipe his chest and finds the BURN MARK where

his ring lies

Mirena REMOVES THE RING from around Vlad’s neck

( )

49

Vlad WAKES with a start

MIRENA
You need help

VLADS POV Mirena is speaking but he can’t hear a word
she’s saying Her voice drowned out by her THUNDERING HEART

Vlad gropes for the silver signet ring around his neck but
it’s not there

Vlad looks at Mirena as if she were a stranger

MIRENA (cont’d)
Vlad

A terrifying beat

Vlad pulls Mirena to the ground TEARS open her dress at the
collar She struggles but Vlad is consumed with the
thirst for blood

Vlad bares his FANGS He lowers his jaw to her throat --

One sound cuts through the thunder Ingeras’ VOICE OUTSIDE
across the camp

INGERAS’ VOICE
Mama Where are you

Sanity flickers in Vlad’s eyes He pulls away from Mirena

VLAD
I’m sorry

Mirena is curled in a ball shielding herself from Vlad
Vlad is crushed by the thought that he would have killed her

Vlad draws his knife and SLASHES OPEN the roof of the tent --

SUNLIGHT POURS DOWN on Vlad As the rays of the sun touch
him the BLOOD BURNS in his veins Vlad is engulfed in
FLAMES He does not move He lets himself burn

Mirena gasps repulsed as Vlad’s awful Un-Dead face is
exposed

But in his red eyes Mirena can still recognize her husband
And her husband is dying

MIRENA
Vlad

( )

49 49

Mirena pushes Vlad OUT OF THE SUNLIGHT Throws her cloak
over him to smother the fire Vlad lies in a SHADED CORNER
His flesh charred gritting his teeth in pain

MIRENA (cont’d)
What are you

VLAD
I became the thing men fear on
Broken-Tooth Not a ghost
Something else
Mirena’s hand touches her cross to give her strength

VLAD (contd)
I wanted to drink your blood

This is almost too much for Mirena to bear
MIRENA
May God strike down whoever did

this to you

VLAD
I chose this

MIRENA
Why would you ever do such a thing

They hear Ingeras calling out again closer now

INGERAS’S VOICE
Mama

VLAD
(to Mirena)
Because I sent corpses back to
Mehmed instead of our son
Mirena reels suddenly complicit

VLAD (contd)
A man can’t win this war

50 EXT TENT - DAY 50
Mirena finds Ingeras outside sleepy-eyed looking for her

MIRENA
Back to sleep sweetheart

EXT CAMPSITE - DAY 51
Tethered GOATS graze Mirena APPROACHES a goat with resolve
Checks to be sure the animals’ docile eyes are the only ones

that see her

Mirena has a WATER SKIN in one hand a KNIFE in the other

INT TENT - DAY 52

Vlad pours GOAT’S BLOOD into his mouth from the water skin
He grimaces at the taste but sucks it down greedily

Vlad’s injuries HEAL The incessant heartbeats are QUIETED
but not entirely silenced Some small measure of relief

Vlad feels Mirena watching as he wipes the blood from his
mouth She’s trying not to unravel as the reality sinks in

MIRENA
You’1l undo this won’t you You
can undo this

Vlad nods

VLAD
I haven’t taken the last step

MIRENA
What is it

VLAD
Drinking what comes from men
instead of goats I’11 never do
that

She sets her shoulders finding a measure of solace

MIRENA
Then God will forgive you

VLAD
As easy as that
MIRENA
It’s not that easy You have to

ask

Vlad breaks the handle off a wooden hairbrush leaving a
sharp tip an improvised STAKE

( )

52

VLAD
A wooden stake through my heart
will kill me

Vlad puts the stake in Mirena’s hand Her eyes well up She
hands it back

MIRENA
It would kill us both

EXT CAMPSITE - DAY 53

Vlad’s band of Boyars Guards and Servants prepares to move

wondering the same thing

and sees

Bright-Eyes and the Janissaries travelling fast One carries
a BASKET OF CARRIER PIGEONS on his back They are single-
minded predators tracking Mirena and the band of
Transylvanians

Vlad frantically SHOUTS to get their attention

silent prayer not just for Dimitru but for them all

EXT WOODS - NIGHT 62

Ingeras stumbles through the trees Mirena catches him
Embraces her crying child

MIRENA
We’re safe Your father’s here

EXT MONASTERY - NIGHT 63
Most of the Transylvanians made it inside But not all

Castle Guards SHIELD a few female servants and children
Death is certain

as Janissaries EMERGE FROM THE FOG around them

One Janissary is YANKED BACKWARDS swallowed in the murk
His shouts ended by the CRACK of his neck

The Janissaries rush to confront their unseen attacker
The Transylvanians watch them FADE FROM VIEW Hear the
desperate WHISPERS of scimitars cutting nothing but air
CRIES of surprise Then fear Then pain

Then nothing

( )

63

Something is flung from the fog --

The BASKET OF PIGEONS The Janissary Bird Keeper is gone
but the frenzied birds are spattered with his blood

With the basket UPENDED the birds fly FREE

TWO RED EYES pierce the gloom Searching for anything left
to kill The body from which they burn remains HIDDEN

The women and children huddle behind the terrified men
With an unsympathetic glower the eyes withdraw

ANGLE ON THE FOREST

A surviving STOUT JANISSARY hidden huddles in fear
A shadow looms behind him

Bright-Eyes Alive He puts one of his good fingers to his
lips Shhh

INT MEHMED’S TENT - NIGHT 64
General Omer finds the Sultan alone Something is wrong

GENERAL OMER
Word from the Janissaries

Mehmed gestures to the BLOODSTAINED PIGEONS flitting in a
cage

MEHMED
When we fought as boys I would
beat him every time But once I
caught him smiling at me I knew
what his smile said
(beat)

If this were not your house if
you were not the Sultan’s son

Mehmed dusts himself off

MEHMED (cont’d)
Prepare the men

INT MONASTERY HALL - NIGHT 65

Inside a few of Vlad’s people who died during the attack
have been laid in repose

The Monks lead the traumatized survivors in PRAYER

Vlad ENTERS interrupting
VLAD
Get off your knees Prayers won’t
defend these walls

The Monks are taken aback Those praying look stung

CAZAN
What’s wrong with you

VLAD
The Turks won’t wait for mass to
end

CAZAN

They’re more afraid of whatever
killed those Janissaries

Realizing this only makes Vlad angrier
VLAD
These mountains are thick with
wolves And blood was in the air
Brother Lucian APPROACHES Vlad
BROTHER LUCIAN
There is evil greater than the

Turks

VLAD
Not in my experience

Lucian blocks Vlad’s way Insistent
BROTHER LUCIAN
Prince there’s something I need to
show you
Vlad impatient FOLLOWS Brother Lucian to
AN ALCOVE The monk selects an aged BOUND VOLUME
BROTHER LUCIAN (cont‘d)
It is able to move amongst us

hidden

ON VLAD Growing unease Does Lucian suspect him

( ) 65

BROTHER LUCIAN (contd)
The ancient Assyrians named it
“Ekimmu” or “Departed Spirit” but
even in those times these things
were already old

(reading from the book)
“Knowing no care they grind the
land like corn Knowing no mercy
they rage against mankind They
are demons full of violence
ceaselessly devouring blood”

Lucian turns the page to reveal a woodcut ILLUSTRATION It
depicts a figure with a likeness of afanged demonic face

BROTHER LUCIAN (contd)
This is its true face

Vlad’s stomach jumps but he betrays nothing

BROTHER LUCIAN (contd)
You must help me destroy it

Brother Lucian doesn’t know it’s him Vlad is relieved
Mostly relieved

VLAD
Should be easy enough to spot
(turns to leave)
Until then I have defenses to
build and swords to sharpen

BROTHER LUCIAN
This creature will not stop until
the earth is dead

ON VLAD Lucian’s words make him pause But surely this is
not his future

BROTHER LUCIAN (contd)
How strong is your faith

VLAD
I believe in God But I don’t have
any faith in him
EXT MONASTERY GROUNDS - PRE-DAWN 66
Vlad gathers all his able-bodied men -- what’s left of his
Castle Guard a few Servants and some stalwart Monks They
are now Vlad’s FIGHTERS forty in all

Vlad tests the heft of a fresh-cut SHARPENED WOODEN POLE

( )

66

VLAD
I want more like this Buried at
high angles ten paces behind the
trenches
(points)
Dug there And there Across the
narrowest part of the pass

Captain Petru nods Vlad slaps him on the back

VLAD (contd)
Their chests are armored but their
throats are soft

Across all the activity Vlad sees Ingeras and Mihai picking
wild berries and feasting Vlad lingers on the incongruously
peaceful scene

Ingeras spots his father and waves Vlad waves back
Feeling as far from his son as if he were on a ship leaving
shore

Vlad turns his attention to the SKY The sun has already
cast one side of the valley in gold

He’s remained outside as long as he can afford Time to head
indoors

Vlad passes GRAVE DIGGERS -- Brother Lucian among them --
burying the dead One grave bears Dimitru’s name sprinkled
with fresh cut WILDFLOWERS

BROTHER LUCIAN
Your friend is in my prayers

VLAD
You would have liked him He saw
doomsday in every calendar

Vlad WALKS toward the Monastery

Where Vlad was standing Brother Lucian notices the
wildflowers are now suddenly putrid

ON BROTHER LUCIAN Sinking dread
VLAD

Is almost to the MONASTERY DOOR when A RAY OF SUN flares
from a notch in the cliffs

and floods the doorway with sunlight

( ) 66

Vlad is STOPPED AT THE THRESHOLD He can’t pass through
without burning

VLAD (contd)
(low to heaven)
You spur on daybreak just to spite
me

Vlad catches Brother Lucian staring at him The monk’s
frozen the pieces of the puzzle falling into place

Vlad tries to remain calm as the LINE OF SUNLIGHT encroaches
by the second He heads toward

THE SMITHY

It’s still in SHADE A separate hut on the monastery
grounds Inside BLACKSMITH MONKS repair arms and armor

Three of the Smithy’s walls are open to the air screened
with canvas but it will have to do

Just before DAYLIGHT floods the valley Vlad DUCKS INSIDE
INT SMITHY - DAY 67
The BLACKSMITH MONKS curiously look up from their work

Vlad knows he’s trapped in here He plays for time
examining weapons laid out to cool

VLAD
I need a sword

Vlad looks up to see Lucian judging him from the doorway

BROTHER LUCIAN
You can still repent

Vlad knows he’s in trouble But he keeps up the charade
VLAD
(to the Blacksmith Monks)
Did I forget to say “please”
The Blacksmith Monks shift their weight uncomfortably
BROTHER LUCIAN
Fly brothers Seek refuge

outside In the sun

The Blacksmith Monks quickly EXIT THE SMITHY

( )

67 67

VLAD
What are you accusing me of

Lucian’s eyes bore into Vlad’s Drop the act

BROTHER LUCIAN
I don’t know how you found this
path Perhaps the devil ensnared
your spirit against your will

VLAD
You can’t understand You took a
vow You have no wife no son

BROTHER LUCIAN
Some good part of you remains
(beat)
Repent

VLAD
For what

Lucian gathers himself Finally

BROTHER LUCIAN
May Christ have mercy on you

Brother Lucian TEARS DOWN one of the CANVAS WALLS

SUNLIGHT bursts into the Smithy catching Vlad full in the
face Vlad ERUPTS INTO FLAME

Vlad’s monstrous face is revealed for all to see

Lucian trips back in terror It is the face from his book
Vlad collapses in a SHADOWED CORNER in agony flesh charred
Through a haze of pain Vlad peers OUTSIDE

A half-dozen Castle Guards have cordoned off the Smithy
crossing themselves in mortal fear

Monks try to minister calm but they are just as afraid as
the others

Vlad sees Mirena vainly trying to push past the Guards to get
to him

The HEARTBEATS outside are a CACOPHONY

A RAT scurries into the Smithy Stops in front of Vlad

( ) 67

Vlad snatches the rat and BITES it At this small infusion
of blood Vlad’s burns begin to HEAL More rats trickle in
to rejuvenate their master
EXT MONASTERY GROUNDS - OUTSIDE THE SMITHY - DAY 68
Mirena argues emotionally with Simion
MIRENA
Give him the chance to explain
himself
Simion practically drips self-righteous piety
SIMION “THE WISE”
We all succumbed to his witchcraft
I forgive you for that
(addressing the people)
Who stands with me
INT SMITHY - DAY 69
Now HEALED Vlad watches as three members of his Castle Guard
raise their hands to volunteer Led by Simion they
APPROACH the Smithy Armed with TORCHES

VLAD
Simion I warn you

SIMION “THE WISE”
Why would I turn from God’s work

VLAD
You’ve never been more than a fig-
eating jackal

Vlad searches the faces of men once loyal to him and he to
them

VLAD (contd)
(angry)
Stefan Janos Stop this

But all he finds are the unforgiving stares of his assassins

TORCHES are thrown setting FIRE to the Smithy Flames eat
at the roof and walls letting in the sun’s deadly rays

Vlad CRIES OUT as LIGHT RAKES HIS SKIN Out of time
Vlad notes the pile of drained rats Focuses his mind

OUTSIDE THE SMITHY

( )

69
A BLACK RAT RUNS into the MOVING SHADOWS of the men feeding

the blaze darting from WALKING SHADOW to WALKING SHADOW
underfoot barely avoiding the direct rays of the SUN

No one notices the Black Rat scamper into the shade
EXT MEHMED’S ARMY - NEAR BORGO PASS - DAY 70
Mehmed’s Army marches to DRUMBEAT

Mehmed gazes ahead with anticipation General Omer grows
fearful as they draw closer to their foe

MEHMED
I have never seen you like this

GENERAL OMER
God does not shine on this place

MEHMED
It will not be said that I was
stopped here By him

Mehmed signals The drums STOP The Army halts

MEHMED (cont’d)
(to his men)
Do you remember when you first
joined the army You wanted to
pick up a sword and start fighting
right away but the first thing
they taught you to do was march

The Soldiers are rapt hanging on their Sultan’s every word

MEHMED (cont’d)
When they blindfolded you you did
not believe you could march without
seeing But you could

(beat)

Remember their words “You have no
eyes you have no ears you have no
heart just feel the drum pound
in your chest”

Mehmed moves through his ranks golden armor shining

MEHMED (cont’d)
When next the drums go still you
will draw your swords Tonight
your Sultan guides you

INT MONASTERY HALL - SUNSET 71

Mirena stares at the pillar of smoke that was the smithy
Grief hasn’t come yet Cazan kneads his cane

Ingeras is filled with dread even though he doesnt
understand what’s happened

INGERAS
When’s papa coming back

Mirena just brushes back a lock of his hair
MIRENA
(to Cazan)
We need to finish the defenses
CAZAN
(quietly to Mirena)

You knew And yet you said
nothing

MIRENA
I loved him

Simion strides up Wearing a face of deepest condolences

SIMION “THE WISE”
How is our new Prince faring

MIRENA
(sotto)
He doesn’t know his father’s gone
SIMION “THE WISE”
Well now he can do for us what his
father never could

Simion signals for his accomplices to take Ingeras

SIMION “THE WISE” (cont’d)
I pray the Sultan still wants him

Furious Mirena pulls Ingeras tight to her

MIRENA
You wouldn’t dare

Captain Petru ENTERS grim-faced

CAPTAIN PETRU
There’s no body

71

Simion’s stomach twists in a knot

EXT MONASTERY GROUNDS - SUNSET 72
Word that Vlad still lives floods the Monastery Everyone
degenerates into a terrified jumble running in all

directions

Mirena leads Ingeras through the confusion She knows
what’s coming

The SUN SETS A frightened hush descends on everyone
She waylays Mihai Puts Ingeras’ hand in his
MIRENA
(to Mihai)

Take him to my room and shut the
door Don’t let him look outside

INGERAS
(scared)
Mama —-
MIRENA
(to Mihai)
Now

Mihai RUSHES OFF with Ingeras
The crowd PARTS
VLAD

Walks through his people’s midst carrying a SHARPENED POLE
from the defenses Hate so rabid that reason is impossible

Mirena sucks in her breath when she sees her husband
Realizes there’s nothing she can do

Simion’s throat tightens He looks at the pole then back
at Vlad

Vlad drives the pole AT SIMION’S GUT --

ON MIRENA She averts her eyes at the sound of Simion’s
scream A piece of her dying too

A GRISLY SHADOW is cast on the ground at her feet The
shadow of Simion’s skewered body lifted into the air and
planted upright

Vlad fixes furious eyes on the men who joined Simion

( )

72

VLAD
(to Captain Petru)
Impale the rest of the traitors
You see how the Turks do it Avoid
the heart

Under Vlad’s gaze Captain Petru and the Castle Guards
restrain Simion’s accomplices The order is terrible but
what choice do they have

CAZAN

(to Vlad)
When I brought you home from the
Sultan’s palace I thought I still
saw goodness in you Despite
everything you had done

(beat)
But you’re still one of them

VLAD
There’s a reason the Turks are the
ones taking over the world

Everyone watches in horror as the Guards pick up sharpened
poles with shaking hands The Traitors BEG FOR MERCY as
the sharp tips are aimed at their chests

Vlad’s fury shows no sign of dimming

-until he sees Mirena’s eyes boring into his This isn’t
who you are This isn’t the man I love

ON VLAD Revulsion plays across his face A moment of
clarity He notices for the first time the weeping women and
children His own people terrified of him

Vlad suddenly HALTS Captain Petru before the deed can be
done His manner is brusque allowing no weakness to show

VLAD (contd)
That’s enough

Spared execution the Traitors collapse weeping

EMERGES from the crowd

Kneel Bow down before the power
of our Lord Christ

Brother Lucian raises his CRUCIFIX in challenge The other
Monks follow suit in a wall of solidarity

BROTHER LUCIAN (contd)
Leviticus 17 Quoth the Lord “If
any man eat blood I will set my
face against his soul For the
life of all flesh is in the blood”

Vlad looks at the power of God arrayed against him Crosses
wielded by brave-hearted men of faith

VLAD
Go back to your books

Their crosses have no effect

BROTHER LUCIAN

(to his fellow Monks)

He should not be able to
withstand This can’t be

MIRENA
It means there’s still hope for
him It must

Vlad righteous ire can barely be contained No one can hold
his gaze

VLAD
Do you think you’re alive because
you can fight Because you’re
brave You’re servants Peasants
(beat)
Youre alive because of me

Vlad points down the pass the way Mehmed will come
VLAD (contd)

And I’m the only one who can save
you now

EXT SKY ABOVE THE BORGO PASS - NIGHT 73
A BLACK BAT with the wide wingspan of a hawk FLIES ABOVE the
marching Turkish Army From this height Mehmed’s golden
armor is a mere speck to be brushed away

The Bat DIVES -- zeroes in on its golden target Mehmed’s
helmet looks up too late as --

The Black Bat is upon him TRANSFORMING back into Vlad

VLAD
Your war ends now

Vlad tears off Mehmed’s helmet --

But this is NOT MEHMED it is his boyish-faced ADJUTANT A
DECOY wearing golden armor

VLAD (contd)

(grabs him by the throat)
Where is he

Vlad scans the Turkish Army Mehmed could be any one of
them A needle in a haystack

VLAD (contd)
Coward Show your face

Then Vlad realizes something is wrong The marching Turkish
Soldiers do not seem to be aware of him

Vlad STRIKES a Turk down The soldier SCREAMS as he DIES
The Army marches on Their discipline unwavering
Vlad pulls off the dead Turk’s helmet -- sees the soldier is
BLINDFOLDED and his ears packed with BEES’ WAX It’s the
same with every Turkish Soldier
MEHMED IN THE TURKISH RANKS 74
Dressed as a common soldier he blends in with the rest But
his eyes and ears are uncovered He calls out to Vlad his
echoing voice impossible to pinpoint
MEHMED
They cannot fear what they cannot

see

ON VLAD Watching with futility The Turks march blindly
past him in pace to the thundering drums

74

Theyll arrive by dawn
EXT MONASTERY GATES - NIGHT 75
The night sky is lightening in the east

On the monastery walls the Transylvanian Fighters can’t see
doom approaching but they can hear it Turkish DRUMS echo
through the pass

Vlad ENTERS through the gate He’s given a wide berth

CAPTAIN PETRU
Prince they’re still coming You
said --

Vlad strides past without a word consumed with anxiety
INT CHAPEL - MONASTARY - NIGHT 76

Vlad stands alone in the chapel Chastened His eyes raised
to the crucified Christ

VLAD

I can’t save them I’ve tried
everything but I can’t find a way
I’m out of time So I guess you
made your point

(beat)
But you can still save my people
You can spare my wife and my son
You could do it with a thought
They don’t deserve this

Vlad drops to his knees at Christ’s feet

VLAD (contd)
I suppose you want me to beg So
Ill beg Please Help them
Show me a sign

Vlad waits Never has there been such silence Even the
candle doesnt flicker

VLAD (contd)
You want me to accept it Accept
death Grief You’re an expert in
suffering aren’t you So you sit
up there and relish ours That’s
your dirty secret You want
revenge

(seething)

76 76
VLAD (contd)
You son of a whore I see right
through you You’re just getting
even

Vlad rises fists clenched

VLAD (contd)
Well you’re not the only one who
can be vengeful You think I’ve
done my worst I swear if you take
my family I’1l gorge like a pig on
the blood of your flock Guilty
innocent I won’t care I’11 send
them all back to you

Vlad senses something turns --

Ingeras stands still in the doorway dressed in his night-
clothes holding something behind his back Vlad wonders
if he heard

VLAD (contd)
You should be in bed

INGERAS
The drums are too loud

Vlad holds out his arms to comfort him

VLAD
Come here

Ingeras hesitates

VLAD (contd)
What is it

INGERAS
Are you sick

How much does Ingeras know

VLAD
Who told you that

INGERAS
I heard Simion talking with Mama
(quiet)
Is that why you killed him

( ) 76

VLAD
(after a beat)
I killed Simion because he wanted
to hurt you It was as simple as
that

Ingeras nods The boy thinks he understands
Vlad gestures to whatever his son’s got behind his back

VLAD (contd)
What are you hiding

Ingeras shows his father a LOAF OF BREAD

INGERAS
If you were sick I thought it
would make you feel better

ON VLAD moved He wonders if he can still eat it

VLAD
Maybe Bring it here

Vlad breaks the bread in two Half for Ingeras half for
himself Vlad raises it to his lips

Ingeras notices his father’s hesitancy
Vlad takes a cautious bite
Nothing happens It tastes as he remembers

The two of them sit and eat For a moment everything seems
the way it was before this nightmare ground down on them

VLAD (contd)
I do feel better Thank you

Then the Turkish DRUMS creep back into his consciousness

ON VLAD The irony is cruel The moment sours It all
seems a lie Here in what are maybe their final hours what
wisdom can he possibly give his son

VLAD (contd)
I won’t always be around You will
be alone And someday if fortune
allows youll have this country to
rule So I want you to remember
something Don’t trust anyone

(harsh)
(MORE)

( ) 76
VLAD (contd)
Not the people who sing songs of
your glory Not the advisors who
flatter you Not even your family
who tell you they love you
(beat)
Not even me

Ingeras has never seen his father look so lost

INGERAS
But when the Turks came to take me
away you stopped them It’s why
you got sick isn’t it To save
me

Vlad’s blindsided Does his son really understand the
sacrifice he made

VLAD
(overwhelmed)
Yes

INGERAS
I’1l remember that

Vlad wraps Ingeras in his arms Brought low by humility and
love

The cynicism he felt when entering this sacred space falls
away From his son he’s been granted some measure of
absolution from the mistakes he knows he’s made

VLAD
Back to bed now

Ingeras gives his father one last squeeze and EXITS

Alone Vlad looks down at the remaining crust of his son’s
gift A tightening in his chest Then pain --

Vlad RETCHES UP THE BREAD rejected by his body as poison
He collapses UNCONSCIOUS

INT MIRENA’S CHAMBER - MONASTERY - NIGHT 77
Vlad wakes in bed Mirena sits nearby The tension between
them is unspoken She gestures to a CUP OF ANIMAL BLOOD

within his reach

MIRENA
Youll need your strength

( )

Vlad drinks He knows he should be nauseated by it

healing effects are nearly instantaneous

VLAD
He outsmarted me Mehmed’s army
will pour past our defenses and
that will be the end

The Turkish DRUMS beat out the passing time
Mirena finally looks at Vlad

MIRENA
Youve fought and you’ve struggled
and kept your soul your own Your
curse can be forgiven You can be
a man again

VLAD

(takes a sip from the cup)
Turks can’t taste worse than rats

Mirena spins on him chilled to the bone

MIRENA
I won’t let you

Vlad’s frustration bubbles over
VLAD

I could have more power Enough to
make storms Enough to crush those

dogs

MIRENA
And then what

VLAD
Do you want to die

MIRENA
I still have faith

Vlad points to the cross around her neck

VLAD
He’d let you be butchered

MIRENA
(correcting him)
I have faith in you

That makes Vlad pause

but it’s

( ) 77

VLAD
I don’t understand that either

But he’s sure he’s never loved her as much as he does right
now

MIRENA
Id rather die with you by my side
than spend Eternity alone I
always knew you’d die by the sword
If it’s today I’m ready to go with
you

Mirena leans into Vlad’s chest Tears come

Vlad’s hand slips in his pocket to find a handkerchief to dry
them

He also finds a crumpled parchment

The TERMS OF SURRENDER Mehmed offered and Vlad refused
Choices made chances lost Seems like a thousand years ago

Vlad notes Mehmed’s THUMBPRINT in BLOOD now dried brown

MIRENA (cont’d)
What is it

Vlad’s eyes glint with an idea He lowers his nose to
Mehmed’s blood print and CATCHES THE SCENT

VLAD
I can find the son of a bitch

Vlad is flush with excitement a condemned man given a last-
minute reprieve

VLAD (contd)
Tomorrow I’ll set things right

Mirena desperately wants to believe him but she feels the
weight of an opportunity lost

MIRENA

Mehmed MARCHES within his blindfolded Army

General Omer weaves through the ranks to report the Stout
Janissary at his side

GENERAL OMER
Word from behind their lines
Vlad’s child has been found

Mehmed does not respond because his eyes are drawn upward
VLAD ON THE ROCK SPUR 82

Extends his hand It appears as if he casts a GIANT SHADOW
across the Turkish Army advancing up the pass below A
colossal BLACK HAND alive and writhing

The “shadow” is an impossible number of BATS in the shape of
Vlad’s hand An extension of his will “Fingers” extended
like claws The “hand of bats” SLAMS DOWN on the Turks
breaking into a swarm of millions

82

IN THE FRONT RANKS OF MEHMED’S ARMY
Tiny fangs BITE exposed skin drawing BLOOD

But the Turkish Soldiers resist tearing off their blindfolds
The march CONTINUES

MEHMED AND GENERAL OMER

Watch the SWARM OF BATS moving TOWARD THEM leaving no
Turkish Soldier untouched

GENERAL OMER
Bats cannot kill men

Mehmed feels a dawning alarm

MEHMED
He is looking for me

VLAD ON THE ROCK SPUR 83
Sniffs the air Tensed to strike
ON THE MONASTERY BATTLEMENTS 84

Vlad’s men shudder as the Turks bear down How can they face
so many

MEHMED 85
Runs to the Drummers Tears off the LEADER’S blindfold

MEHMED
Stop the march

The Drummers cease beating Soldiers pull off their
blindfolds ready to fight but see a MAELSTROM OF BATS
They react with primal fear

MEHMED (cont’d)
(feigning fear)
Run for your lives
Their Sultan’s “cowardice” breaks them The Turks FLEE
MEHMED (cont’d)
(under his breath)
Come Vlad Take the bait

Mehmed sees the BATS almost upon him and runs

VLAD ON THE ROCK SPUR 86

Sees the Turks falling back Senses the advantage swing
SHOUTS down to his men

Kill them while they run

BRIGHT-EYES
Your son will live But in time he
will not remember you

MIHAT 89

Bursts into the room hefting a sword too heavy for him
Bright-Eyes BACKHANDS Mihai like the child he is

Mihai bravely repeats the Turkish insult Vlad taught him
Bright-Eyes stops cold We’ve never seen him angry before

Bright-Eyes SLASHES Mihai’s leg raises his sword to finish
him off --

Mirena flings a shovelful of HOT COALS from the fireplace in
Bright-Eyes’ face

Mirena and Ingeras RUN back out ONTO THE BALCONY as the
first RAYS OF THE SUN strike the distant mountain peaks

MEHMED ON THE BATTLEFIELD 90

Swats at attacking BATS Teeth BITE his hands draw BLOOD --

Catches Mehmed’s scent in the air The tumult of battle is
filtered out Mehmed’s distant figure becomes clear
VLAD
Got you

Mirena lowers Ingeras over the edge onto

Bright-Eyes LUNGES for her as she follows her son She falls
onto the roof Tiles CUT her shoulder

VLAD ON THE ROCK SPUR 93
Freezes He senses their peril

Vlad dives OFF THE CLIFF -- transforms into a BAT mid-air
Black wings speed him toward the Monastery

MIRENA AND INGERAS ON THE ROOF 94

Move carefully over slick TILES The roof angles down and
ends in a SHEER DROP

Bright-Eyes PURSUES Mirena SLIPS SLIDES halfway over

Feet dangling Losing her grip

INGERAS

Ingeras hasnt the strength to help her

Sees his wife hanging from the roof Almost there
The SUN RISES

Vlad CRASHES on the high balcony In the form of a man
his body haloed in fire Vlad crawls

Vlad is trapped in the shade his body ravaged He has a
stomach-churning VIEW of his wife and child’s plight

MIRENA AND INGERAS ON THE ROOF

Her hands slipping Without saying a word Bright-Eyes
PICKS UP INGERAS Ingeras CRIES OUT

Bright-Eyes sees Vlad watching helplessly Bright-Eyes
tucks the child under his arm dips in a window and is GONE

VLAD

Reaches out to his wife only to BURN when he touches the
light Mirena knows there’s nothing he can do

VLAD
(to Mirena)
Hold on

Vlad looks across the room at Mihai who stares back in fear
Mihai can’t get away hobbled by the injury to his leg

Mirena realizes what Vlad is going to do

MIRENA
Don’t

Mirena watches in horror as Vlad sinks his fangs into Mihai’s
neck and DRINKS until the boy is dead

ON VLAD He can feel himself COURSING WITH POWER his will
now able to enact what his heart desperately desires

THE SKY ABOVE THE MONASTERY

Is stained from horizon to horizon by STORM CLOUDS commanded
by Vlad Day becomes NIGHT

MIRENA

Shuts her eyes against her tears Mirena lets go of the
roof choosing her fate She FALLS --

Vlad CATCHES Mirena’s arm Pulls her up
exposing the CRUCIFIX that hangs from Mirena’s neck

The CROSS GLOWS WITH WHITE LIGHT in Vlad’s presence A light
Vlad cannot bear The power of God repels him

( ) 94

The two stare at each other Mirena’s eyes hollow

MIRENA (cont’d)
Your hands are cold

Mirena chooses to let go of her husband’s hand
She FALLS AWAY into the abyss Vlad DIVES after her

As Vlad PLUMMETS after his beloved the BLINDING LIGHT of the
cross denies his hands purchase on her

Vlad TRANSFORMS His corporeal form RIPS APART into
anything that can reach her Anything that can save her
A falling smoky chaos of RAT BAT WOLF and the
howling anguished DEMONIC FACE that is his own

But Mirena is forever out of reach

DOWN ON THE GROUND 95

Vlad cradles his wife’s dead body wracked with sobs

VLAD
Mirena

Nearby her cross still smolders with white heat
MEHMED ON THE BATTLEFIELD 96

Stares curiously up at the darkened sky then turns his
attention to the Transylvanians

MEHMED
(irritated to Omer)
Attack
CAZAN INSIDE THE MONASTERY 97
Stands among the women and children He can only watch as
the Turks SURGE IN A Turk CLUBS him across the brow
EXT MONASTERY - NIGHT 98

Vlad looks up at the approaching Turks His grief and rage
have turned to madness

Vlad sees Mehmed deep in their midst on horseback Ingeras
sits on the saddle in front of him a scared and crying
trophy

Vlad CHARGES the whole Turkish Army Smashes into their
lines Killing like a beast fury unmatched

( )

98

One against a thousand

VLAD
Kill you all

Turks clamor away from Vlad hardened soldiers unmanned by
fear Vlad cuts through them with ease

Vlad is unstoppable Pushing relentlessly toward his son

Frightened Azabs set their lances Vlad careens into them
heedless Lances snap like twigs but PIERCE his flesh

Vlad tears into an echelon of Sipahis slays them by the
dozen Scimitars break armor sunders like paper He
drives deeper into the Turkish ranks like the whirling eye of
a hurricane A red storm of vengeance

But one thing keeps the Turks from dropping their swords and
running

They see that Vlad BLEEDS
The Turks are fighting back now Landing blow after blow
For every one Vlad kills ten more take their place and

there is only so fast he can heal

Vlad goes to one knee Struggles to his feet to meet the
next wave hacking at him with abandon

Every Turk wants a piece now To avenge their brethren To
say that on this day they killed the one who could not die

Vlad reaches out to Ingeras who recedes from him like a
mirage He failed his only son

WE SEE FROM HIGH ABOVE
Vlad is merely one man in an ocean of Turks He is ENGULFED
The clouds DISSOLVE The SKY CLEARS

The sun IGNITES the Un-Dead blood staining Turkish blades
Everywhere Vlad’s blood poured or spattered is AFLAME

Vlad lies drained from a thousand cuts He does not burn
He doesn’t have any blood left in him

MEHMED
You were just flesh after all

Sight dimming Vlad sees Mehmed with his distressed son

( ) 98

MEHMED (cont’d)
I will not make the same mistake my
father did I will have to stunt
this little weed so he does not
grow so strong
Mehmed shows Ingeras the SILHOUETTE of Simion’s impaled body
MEHMED (cont’d)
This is what your father will be
remembered for
Vlad can say nothing His LIFELESS eyes stare up at his son
MEHMED (cont’d)
(to his men)
Bury his wife Leave Kaziglu Bey
for the crows
EXT MONASTERY - NIGHT 99

Cazan limps from the abandoned Monastery feels the GASH on
his forehead where he was struck

The Turks are gone

Grief-stricken Cazan kneels at Vlad’s discarded body He
rolls him over Vlad’s eyes are still open Cazan slides
his palm over Vlad’s face to close the lids

BLOOD on Cazan’s hand drops onto Vlad’s cheek

Cazan notices the DROPLET stir slowly moving drawn into
Vlad’s MOUTH

Cazan thinks he understands

Cazan lays his WRIST across Vlad’s MOUTH Presses the
BLADE OF HIS KNIFE firmly against his own artery

CAZAN
You’re not finished

Cazan steels himself and CUTS --

CLOSE ON VLAD’S EYES They OPEN Alive and angry

VLAD
Where’s my son

CAZAN
Mehmed took him

( )

99 99

Vlad catches Cazan as he slumps Only now does Vlad see
Cazan’s CUT WRISTS and realize the sacrifice

VLAD
Do you want to kill them

CAZAN
Yes

Vlad CUTS HIS OWN WRIST gently presses it to Cazan’s lips

VLAD
Drink

Vlad gazes across the battlefield

Most of his Fighters lie dead But some grievously wounded
still cling to life

100 EXT MONASTERY - LATER 100
Vlad stands at Mirena’s grave Cloak snapping in the wind
VLAD
I know hell exists so I know
there’s a heaven You’re there
So I know I’1l never see you again
Standing behind Vlad
A BROOD OF VAMPIRES

No longer “Ekimmu” Vlad has created something new
“Vampire” from the Latin root “Pi” “To drink”

TWO DOZEN in all They were his Fighters Near death Now
they will never die Their Un-Dead eyes are red and hungry

VLAD (contd)
(to Mirena’s grave)
Your soul can rest knowing that I
will get our son back
Vlad turns to his Vampire Brood They BOW

Cazan bows too unnaturally strong and vibrant No need for
a cane His hand and foot have been RESTORED

101 EXT TURKISH ENCAMPMENT - DANUBE PLAIN - NIGHT 101
The WAR TENTS of the Turkish encampment spike the sky A

stronghold of canvas and silk The Sultan’s Tent is pitched
on a rise

( )

101

Mehmed stands with General Omer and Bright-Eyes overlooking
his new possession Transylvania

MEHMED
Of all my lands this one I love
the least

BRIGHT-EYES
Their boys will be forged into
Janissaries You will not leave
empty handed

MEHMED
I was never going to

General Omer stares at the horizon confused
GENERAL OMER
Look to the east The sun It
does not rise
Where the sunrise should be a STORM is gathering

ON MEHMED He realizes it isn’t over

TURKS ACROSS THE CAMP

Hear the HOWLING OF WOLVES broken by claps of THUNDER
Bolts of LIGHTNING scar the night sky

A TENT on the perimeter shakes violently then COLLAPSES
deflating Sounds of MAYHEM as tents fall like dominoes
Something is tearing a path into the heart of the camp

Turkish SCREAMS rip from all sides The SNAP of
splintering poles cloth TEARING

General Omer’s gaze is drawn overhead to flapping WINGS
BOWMEN shoulder-to-shoulder CAREEN BACK --

A SWARM OF BATS pours over the tents The Turks shield
their faces from the flying scourge even as

VLAD HIMSELF
Emanates from the dark

The bats TRANSMUTE from a thick BLACK FOG into VLAD’S VAMPIRE
BROOD Insatiably thirsty

Turks HACK WILDLY at opponents too fast to touch The rare
Turk who scores a lucky HIT finds his blade has no effect

( ) 101
Most vampires wield the weapons they did in life SLICING and
CHOPPING to harvest the blood they crave Others ALIGHT on
screaming Turks to bear them down under claw and fang

The army that toppled Constantinople RETREATS in chaos like
panicked children

But there is nowhere to go The Vampires are everywhere
devouring

A FLEEING TURK comes face to face with Cazan
CAZAN
I used to think there were too many
of you Now there’s not enough
Cazan seizes the Turk and DRINKS
VLAD

Sees Bright-Eyes standing like a rock in a river parting the
fleeing Turks around him Waiting for him

Bright-Eyes ATTACKS Vlad with a quick feint and slice --
Vlad CATCHES the blade Twists it out of Bright-Eyes’ hand

VLAD
Where is my son

BRIGHT-EYES
I do not fear death

VLAD
Everybody does I did

Vlad PINS Bright-Eyes to a tent post with his own scimitar

Bright-Eyes squirms can’t escape He SCREAMS as a pack of
vampires TEARS into him In the end afraid

IN A SECURE TENT 102

The Peasant Boys chosen as future Janissaries Among them
the RED-HAIRED BOY Vlad saved on Easter The flaps part

The Boys see RED EYES and shrink back but Vlad emerges
VLAD
Stay here I’11 get you back to

your fathers soon enough

Vlad continues his hunt to

( )

102

THE STABLE
Vlad looks in

Mehmed slices open SACK after SACK of SILVER COINS from
wagons laden with treasure from Castle Dracula

Hundreds of thousands of silver coins SPILL across the floor
in a glittering carpet

MEHMED
I did not tax you nearly enough

Vlad hovers angrily He feels the silver’s heat How did
Mehmed know

VLAD
Where is he

INGERAS’ VOICE
Papa --

Vlad can hear his son calling from the GRANARY at the far end
of the stable

MEHMED
Waiting for you

Vlad focuses his eyes on Mehmed’s reaching into his mind

VLAD
Bring him here

Mehmed squints resisting Vlad’s hypnotic stare
MEHMED
Do you not think my will is

stronger than poor Ismail’s

Mehmed FLICKS a coin at Vlad -- Vlad CATCHES it Lets the
silver SCALD his palm staring Mehmed down

IN THE SKY the black clouds churn The silver disrupts
Vlad’s power

Cazan confronts Vlad on edge

CAZAN
Think about what you’re doing

Vlad ignores him and steps

INTO THE STABLE 103

It’s like stepping into an oven Vlad weathers the pain
but feels his strength sap

IN THE SKY cracks in the clouds --

Cazan watches a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT strike several vampires
caught in the open Their Un-Dead flesh scorches

Cazan bounds into a tent’s protective SHADOW eyes red slits

CAZAN
You never listen

IN THE STABLE 104
Mehmed circles like a tiger slicing his sword in the air

Vlad risks taking his eyes off Mehmed for a moment to glimpse
Ingeras in the granary

MEHMED
Which one of us used to win these
I don’t remember

VLAD
Yes you do

The two swordsmen THRUST simultaneously Mehmed’s sword a
hair’s breadth from Vlad’s neck

VLAD (contd)
Close Just like Europe

Vlad and Mehmed COLLIDE in a clang of steel Every trick
they can remember every dirty move they can dream up Their
COMBAT reflected in SILVER all around them

But the longer Vlad stays in here the weaker he becomes

Vlad DODGES -- but Mehmed was aiming at a SACK OF COINS A
cascade of SILVER dumps on Vlad His body SEARED --

MEHMED
How long can you bear it in here

VLAD
Long enough to tear you out of the
history books
Vlad counter-attacks with a devastating chain of sword
strokes The onslaught forces Mehmed back

( )

104 104

Mehmed’s SWORD is knocked away

VLAD (contd)
I can still beat you as a man

But Vlad’s sword feels too heavy He can no longer lift it

MEHMED
You are not a man anymore

Vlad falls SMOLDERS on a bed of silver
105 OUTSIDE ACROSS THE TENT CITY 105
Wide swaths of SUN break through Vampires are trapped in

ever-shrinking pockets of SHADE Emboldened Turks STAB at
the cringing fiends from the safety of the sunlight

106 IN THE STABLE 106
Mehmed picks up a WOODEN LANCE Snaps it over his knee

MEHMED
I’m told a stake through the heart
will kill you just as well Much
cheaper

Vlad pulls himself to his feet as Mehmed THRUSTS the
broken lance --

Vlad GRABS IT barely keeping the tip from his heart --

MEHMED (cont’d)
You fight hard for your child You
are not your father’s son

Mehmed puts his weight on the lance he and Vlad eye to eye

MEHMED (cont’d)

He was toothless and wholly lacking
in majesty yet thought of
himself as a dragon

(pressing forward)
When you were born they called you
“Dracula” “Son of the Dragon”
And yet I have never heard you use
that name Why should you

(laughs )
To be known as the son of a coward

Vlad’s strength wavers Sharp wood TOUCHES HIS HEART

( )

106

With a final burst of strength Vlad pushes the lance aside
and pulls Mehmed into him --

Vlad SINKS HIS FANGS into Mehmed’s neck DRINKS as Mehmed
vainly struggles Vlad’s flesh HEALS

Vlad hurls the still-living Mehmed into
THE GRANARY

Mehmed CRAWLS to a patch of sunlight

As Vlad STALKS TOWARD Mehmed -- out of the silver -- Vlad’s
power reasserts itself and Mehmed’s protective shaft of sun
FADES AWAY
VLAD
Dracula also means “Son of the
Devil”

Pitiless RED EYES rise before Mehmed in the dark They could
swallow him whole They cannot be escaped

Vlad picks up the broken lance and JAMS it though Mehmed’s
chest

Mehmed DIES gurgling
Vlad approaches Ingeras tied up on a bed of straw

INGERAS
Papa

Vlad senses they’re not alone
Brother Lucian raises a SILVER PLATTER as a shield

VLAD
You told him how to kill me

BROTHER LUCIAN
You would be the end of all of us

Vlad SWATS the platter AWAY -- Lucian shuts his eyes ready
for death --

But around Brother Lucian’s neck is revealed his CROSS It
GLOWS WITH WHITE LIGHT

Vlad SHRINKS BACK Brother Lucian is amazed RAISES the
cross White light goes SUPERNOVA

( ) 106

BROTHER LUCIAN (contd)
My strength is the Lord’s

Ingeras sees his father bend in pain as if an invisible
stake were being twisted through his heart

INGERAS
(to Brother Lucian)
Stop it
Brother Lucian unties Ingeras with his free hand
BROTHER LUCIAN
(to Ingeras)
Come with me
EXT TURKISH ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS 107
Brother Lucian leads Ingeras OUTSIDE
The sky is BLACK as night The last Turks fight in vain
Vampires released from their prisons of shadow move like a
plague of locusts leaving nothing living behind
Lucian tries to ignore the bleak tableau spread before him
Ingeras fights back tears
BROTHER LUCIAN
(to Ingeras)
Don’t cry You’re sheltered from

every evil

Brother Lucian looks helplessly at the frightened boy and
the horror surrounding them

The light of Lucian’s cross FLICKERS as his faith wavers
BROTHER LUCIAN (contd)
(eyes shut prays)
Christ Almighty preserve this
child
HOWLS OF DEATH fill his ears There is no reprieve coming

CLOSE ON LUCIAN overtaken by despair The CROSS’ light is
EXTINGUISHED in Lucian’s doubting hand

Vlad nears

( )

107 107

VLAD
(re God)
He’s deaf to your prayers
Something I learned long ago

Brother Lucian slumps in a defeated heap

Vlad tenderly holds his son who is calmed by his father’s
touch Vlad is lost in the moment Nothing else matters

VLAD (contd)
(to Ingeras)
I’m here

Cazan APPROACHES
VLAD (contd)
You old goat

CAZAN
I don’t feel old

Vlad and Cazan grasp forearms in victory
VLAD
Youre cold

CAZAN
It must be the blood that makes

them warm
Vlad gazes across the ravaged Turkish Camp

VLAD
How many are left

CAZAN
(off Lucian and Ingeras)

The only living things here are
them
Vampires have accumulated around Vlad like vultures

VLAD
What about the boys

CAZAN
Boys

108 IN THE SECURE TENT

The Transylvanian Boys taken to be Janissaries lie DEAD
109 VLAD 109

Feels a rush of horror Looks around him Vampires’ mouths
are fresh with dark BLOOD The blood of their own sons

VLAD
Stop this

CAZAN
What have I taught you What have
I repeated over and over since you
were a boy

More vampires DRAW CLOSER All drawn to the child at
Vlad’s side

CAZAN (contd)
All that matters is a Prince’s duty
to his people

Cazan rivets his RED EYES on Ingeras
CAZAN (contd)

Don’t you realize They’re all our
enemies now

An Eager Vampire LUNGES at Ingeras --
Vlad grabs a discarded SPEAR JAMS it into the vampire

VLAD
Know your place

Vlad SNAPS off the metal point in the vampire’s chest -- then
drives the broken wood THROUGH its chest again this time
into the HEART --

The vampire crumples into a final death twisting like a
marionette with strings pulled in all directions

Vlad guides INGERAS to Lucian who holds the boy close Vlad
swings the lance around guards them with his body

VLAD (contd)
Stay away from my son

CAZAN
When he’s gone youll be free

Cazan POUNCES Vlad THRUSTS his broken spear at Cazan --
Cazan SPLINTERS it with his fist Grabs Vlad by the
throat Vlad and Cazan WRESTLE in a titanic struggle

( )

109

CAZAN (contd)
Love will lead you to ruin

Locked in combat Vlad’s eyes meet Cazan’s

VLAD
You forget who I am

Vlad PLUNGES a broken TENT POLE through Cazan’s heart and
hoists him up Cazan’s scream ends abruptly as his body
contorts in the rictus of absolute death

A mass of vampires CONVERGE on Ingeras

Vlad FIGHTS them off with broken spears but realizes he
can’t stop them all Realizes at last his path is still
his to choose

VLAD (contd)
It’s over

Vlad COMMANDS the clouds to EVAPORATE DAYLIGHT starts
punching through --

SHAFTS OF LIGHT rake the Turkish camp --

Vlad and the encroaching vampires IGNITE under the wrath of
the sun still locked in combat

Brother Lucian shelters Ingeras from a storm of cinders as
the Un-Dead Brood BURNS

Vlad battles what looks like an ARMY OF FIRE The immolated
figures press the attack -- ruby-hot swords wielded by
flaming limbs Vlad slashes through the blazing monsters
They curse him as their tongues burn

The sun shines through the smoke and ash as Vlad defeats the
last of the fiery Un-Dead

Vlad’s body is itself wrapped in flame fiercely consuming
itself He holds himself together a moment longer through
sheer will
VLAD (contd)
(to Brother Lucian)
Look after him

As Vlad gazes at his son one last time he falls into a
blazing mass

Lucian cradles the child in his arms

( ) 109

We hear INGERAS’ VOICE reflecting back
INGERAS (VO)
The Turks never came back They

never reached the capitals of
Europe

VLAD’S ASHES remain in a fragile silhouette as if the wind
itself were afraid to disturb them

INT GREAT HALL - CASTLE DRACULA - DAY 110
A cloth is draped over Vlad’s PORTRAIT by Workers lest they
look into its eyes The masked portrait is removed from its

place beside its Father

INGERAS (VO)
Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero

INT FORGE 111

CLOSE ON a bucket of SILVER COINS poured into a molten
soup Hundreds of Vlad’s faces melt

The liquid silver is pressed into molds The new currency of
Transylvania bears the face of no king only the symbol of
its Savior A cross
INGERAS (VO)
But there are no pictures or
statues of him
EXT BORGO PASS - SUNSET 112

As the SETTING SUN dips under the Carpathian Range a blood-
tinged mist hovers over the Monastery ruins

INGERAS (VO)
I don’t even know where he was
buried
A shadowy figure approaches
It’s SHKELGIM His eyes shining with madness
EXT PEASANT FARM - DUSK 113

Dusk sweeps across fields of grain

INGERAS (VO)
Our land is at peace

( )

113

We see a CROSS newly carved into the door of a humble PEASANT
HOME

INT THRONE ROOM - CASTLE DRACULA - NIGHT 114

INGERAS sits on the THRONE His feet can’t reach the ground
He’s attended by Brother Lucian

Assembled BOYARS swear allegiance on bended-knee
INGERAS (VO)
I know my father loved me very

much

Ingeras thoughtfully touches his mother’s crucifix hanging
around his neck He looks out the window into the night

INGERAS (VO)
But I pray I never see him again
