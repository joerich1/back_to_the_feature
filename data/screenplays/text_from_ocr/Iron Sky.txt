GONZALES looks at the ground and SANDERS follows his gaze
and catches sight of something strange a single shoe print

And it doesnt belong to any of them

achievement One of these being the
science of antigravity With our
surpassing knowledge and indomitable
strength we applied our superior
sciences to the lunar bedrock to
engineer a new Vaterland in 1945

Excellent Hannelore

DIETER frowns at the attention HANNELORE receives

The door opens and KLAUS ADLER 41 enters An Intelligence

The NAZIS snap to attention The INTERCOM switches to loud

music a pompous National Socialist march They sing along

to absorb it all

What a comical observation Mein

WASHINGTON is led inside and forced into a chair

WOLFGANG gestures and a NAZI GUARD removes WASHINGTONs
helmet

WOLFGANG
Ein Untermensch Mein Gott

WOLFGANG spits on his fingers and rubs WASHINGTONS cheek
WASHINGTON tries to dodge him with obvious disgust

WASHINGTONS spacesuit is removed

WASHINGTON
(looking around at the
Nazis)
If Ive died this certainly does

not look like heaven

WOLFGANG sees WASHINGTONS necklace Its made of gold with
a matchbox-sized pendant

WOLFGANG
No wonder an easy capture Now

WOLFGANG rips the necklace off of WASHINGTON

WOLFGANG (CONTD)
(disappointed)
Is this creature any use for us

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER fishes a book from his pocket and starts
leafing through it Theres no doubt of the fact that the
book is about human experiments
HERR DOKTOR RICHTER
May I suggest examination
experimentation and finally

extermination

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER approaches WASHINGTON WASHINGTON catches
a glimpse of the cover of HERR DOKTOR RICHTERS book

WASHINGTONS head

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER leans in WASHINGTON head butts him
HERR DOKTOR RICHTER stumbles back knocking himself and
WOLFGANG to the floor

WASHINGTON grabs his helmet and throws it at the feet of
the other NAZIS They fall over like bowling pins

WASHINGTON bolts out the door The empty-headed NAZI GUARDS
get up and wait for WOLFGANGS orders

WOLFGANG tries to rise to his feet only to fall back into a
pile of NAZIS He screams the obvious at the standing NAZIS

WOLFGANG
Catch the prisoner

The NAZI GUARDS take off in pursuit of WASHINGTON
INT SCHWARZE SONNE - CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

WASHINGTON runs aimlessly with the NAZIS in pursuit He

doesnt know which way to go or which way not to go

WASHINGTON can hear the footsteps and shouting of the NAZI
GUARDS

Behind WASHINGTON a CHIME goes off and an elevator door
opens WASHINGTON turns and dashes inside

INT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
A WOMAN and her six year-old DAUGHTER stare at WASHINGTON
The door closes and the elevator ascends

Whats happening is that uncomfortable feeling that total

strangers sometimes experience on a slow moving elevator
Magnified about a million times

To break the unbearable tension WASHINGTON attempts to
engage in a little chit-chat

INT SCHWARZE SONNE - CORRIDORS -—- CONTINUOUS

WASHINGTON comes to a spot where the corridor splits into
two long hallways His pursuers are closing in SHOUTING

orders

WASHINGTON sweating ducks down into the corridors blind
spot The NAZIS pass him all running down the same hallway
WASHINGTON no longer limping races down the other hallway

---and crashes violently against KLAUS The force of the
collision knocks the wind out of KLAUS and crashes him

against the wall He slides to the ground

RENATES eyes widen at the sight of WASHINGTON He gathers

himself and continues running

RENATE glances at KLAUS Hes breathing heavily coming
around RENATE takes off in pursuit of WASHINGTON

INT SCHWARZE SONNE CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

WASHINGTONS out of breath He pants to a dead end and stops
at a security door labeled with German warnings
He tries to open it but the door is sealed air-tight

RENATE
Halt -- I mean stop

RENATE catches up to WASHINGTON

RENATE (CONTD)
That will blow you Suck you

WASHINGTON hears this lifting his eyebrows

RENATE (CONTD)

Its a Schleusel Air vacuum

She pulls his arm away from the door handle

tries to stand but cant gain enough balance to get up

KLAUS arrives with the NAZI GUARDS He steps forward and
delivers a knockout blow to WASHINGTONS jaw

WASHINGTON rolls over out cold KLAUS helps RENATE to
her feet HERR DOKTOR RICHTER looks directly at KLAUS when
he says
HERR DOKTOR RICHTER (CONTD)

your knight in shining armor

HERR DOKTOR RICHTERS face hardens as he turns to the guards

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER (CONTD)

KLAUS
Reciting that nonsense for hours

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER gives WASHINGTON another jolt WASHINGTON

screams

KLAUS

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER adjusts the electric shock dials to

maximum

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER
Examination completed

sized machine imbedded with dials and switches

to the extermination phase

RENATE
But -- you always said your machine

should be tested on a non-Aryan
And now we have one who literally
dropped out of the sky into our

hands

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER lifts his eyebrows

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER
Hm You may be right

He puts away his electric shock device

HERR DOKTOR RICHTER (CONTD)

A quiet dinner at the RICHTERS home KLAUS and HERR DOKTOR
RICHTER chew their food lost in thought

HERR DOKTOR RICHTERS wife FRAU RICHTER 58 sits at the
table the way shes lived her life almost invisibly

RENATE breaks the unbearable silence

RENATE
I wonder why an Untermensch was

sent into space
A long beat as HERR DOKTOR RICHTER and KLAUS react as if
RENATE was a cocker spaniel that suddenly learned to talk
KLAUS
(dismissive)

What makes you think he was sent

INT SCHWARZE SONNE RENATES ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

RENATES room is small and Spartan with a poster of Marlene
Dietrich hanging over her desk On top of the desk are the
items confiscated from WASHINGTON

KLAUS closes the door behind him RENATE is handling the
pendant

RENATE
I think this one is just some kind

of a good luck charm --
KLAUS grabs RENATE and tries to make out with her

RENATE not ready for these almost violent advances
struggles against KLAUS

activating its media player features

MUSIC plays KLAUS and RENATE both startle and KLAUS lets
RENATE go

What the hell

The pendant projects a video onto the wall a beautiful
lush landscape with full moon over it

RENATE shakes her head no

KLAUS holds court as NAZI ELITES watch the video with their
backs to the door Nobody notices WOLFGANG entering

WOLFGANG clears his throat in anticipation of a chorus of

Sieg Heils Nobody hears him The media player ends

WOLFGANG loudly clicks his heels The NAZIS turn They
quickly Sieg Heil WOLFGANG but then they turn back to
KLAUS KLAUS salute is the most indifferent of them all
WOLFGANG frowns
KLAUS

For 73 years we have been planning

to conquer the Earth while they

have been forming similar plans

regarding our moon How ironic

LOANIMTAMTITN
Iron Sky script 33 2409 20

WOLFGANG steps in determined to take control of the meeting

WOLFGANG

And how ironic as an Intelligence

Officer your duty is to inform us

concerning such matters
KLAUS

Interception of their radio

transmissions has not been a

possibility for years

WOLFGANG stares at KLAUS with piercing eyes KLAUS flinches
a little
WOLFGANG
And why is that Do they suspect
something
RENATE (0S)
There is a way to find out how much

they know

They all turn and stare at RENATE an uninvited woman in
another room exclusive to Nazi men

RENATE (CONTD)
An expedition to Earth

WOLFGANG doesnt bother to respond to RENATE He seizes the
opportunity to further humiliate KLAUS
WOLFGANG

Klaus your lady friend has confused

the war room for a kitchen Would

you care to escort her out and show

her the difference before she

ends up mistaking the bridge for

your bedroom

Some NAZIS laugh KLAUS reddens with shame takes RENATE
firmly by the hand and leads her out of the room

RENATE tries to make eye contact with KLAUS as he closes

the door on her and returns to the meeting

WOLFGANG (CONTD)
Its always so moving to witness a

woman trying to think

KLAUS cant take WOLFGANGS patronizing tone any more
KLAUS
Perhaps shes right We do not know

what their plans are

WOLFGANG looks at KLAUS and takes a step towards him

WOLFGANG
(lying)
Actually Ive been considering an

Earth expedition for quite some

time

A shadow of a smile touches WOLFGANGS lips

WOLFGANG (CONTD)
(focusing on Klaus)
And who should lead this expedition

KLAUS
(stiffly)
I was under the impression that I

was to command the mighty
Gétterdammerung

WOLFGANG
Ach I wouldnt worry about it
Adler The G6tterdammerung is not
yet complete Youll be back in
plenty of time

WOLFGANG turns to the other NAZIS for support

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Someone has knowledge of what
happened to the Liberty ship

CHINESE REPRESENTATIVE
You would rather make accusations

than admit that another American
spaceship fell apart in flight

INDIAN REPRESENTATIVE
I find it harder to believe that

the purpose of the flight was just

to help market underwear

Theres tense laughter in the room

EU REPRESENTATIVE
The expenses involved only make

sense if there was a military

purpose

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
We have no military activity on the

moon

MIDDLE EAST REPRESENTATIVE
What about activity towards natural

resources You sometimes tend to

mix those two

more capacity than one actively
uses with this technique a person

content of the speeches with a single

exposure

Radiola type speakers directly at WASHINGTON

RENATE tries to make eye contact with WASHINGTON Hes

unresponsive

RENATE is appalled Its the first time she has witnessed

murder-in-the-name-of-the Reich and she is totally dismayed
KLAUS is indifferent

DIETER hands the photo to HANNELORE She smiles as the photo
gets passed to all the students who respond with admiration

and clapping

DIETER continues

DIETER (CONTD)
The Earth after being abandoned by
its best and proudest sons
degenerated into anarchy chaos and
barbarism In the hands of
incompetent Bolshevist rulers hunger
and poverty are rampant and
technological development is

nonexistent

DIETER looks at RENATE for a reaction She has certainly

now listened -- theres serious doubt in her eyes
RENATE
Yes -- very good Dieter

DIETER takes his seat

RENATE (CONTD)
Any questions

HANNELORE raises her hand and RENATE nods at her
HANNELORE
If the Earth is full of barbarians
how could they send someone here
