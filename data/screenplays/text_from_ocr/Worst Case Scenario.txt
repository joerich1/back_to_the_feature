WORST CASE SCENARIO

by

Michael France

MARCH 15 1997
FADE IN
TIGHT ANGLE - A DIGITAL TIMER FILLS THE SCREEN - IT RACES DOWN
from 005900 as a voice calmly drily weaves a story --

PARRTISH (0S)

Scenario A domestic terror group sends
you a fax to take responsibility for a San
Francisco bombing just before the event
They plan to hearse a Senator whos
pushing a gun control bill and hes
speaking outside a hotel so its a target-
rich environment Maybe a thousand people
cheering him You show up And thats when
you spot this timer

(beat)
Its wired into a fuel-air explosive
hidden in plain sight in a hot dog cart
across the street The timer has twenty
seconds left You think you can cut the
explosive trigger Looks amateurish But
you see two things one is a radio
transmitter signalling away The other
is two vending carts on the street Both
strangely unattended Both near the crowd

(beat)
Think fast

Our VIEW moves from the timer to find the dead serious face of
THOMAS PARRISH
who maintains his serious demeanor as the answer comes from --

HARRY (0S)
Pull the transmitter then disarm the
explosive The radios obviously there to
synchronize a chain detonation in the
bombs in the other carts

The timers BUZZER goes off and Parrish shuts it off --

PARRISH
Times up Pencils down The bad news is
you just blasted approximately one
thousand people into approximately ten
thousand pieces
(smiles)
The good news is -- we get free pie

WIDER VIEW ON TABLE - INSIDE A NEVADA DINER - THE TIMER

is a promo item by the napkins promising BREAKFAST IN 5
MINUTES OR THE PIES ON US Its morning and the diner is full
of customers sipping coffee and reading Nevada newspapers

Parrish -- a man in his forties whose piercing intelligence is
as obvious from his eyes as from the way he speaks -- looks to
the WAITRESS who is just now bringing the food and the check
PARRISH
Make mine blueberry
(beat)
I shouldve ordered steak and eggs You
blew the solution The cart had a master
timer for all three bombs But the radio
wasnt sending a detonation signal --

Parrish slides the check across the table to
HARRY MACNEILL

who is a younger counterpart of Parrish -- driven and
intelligent Parrish is his mentor and Harry wants to prove
himself to him Right now hes realizing the mistake he made

HARRY
-- damn it If the others were triggered
from a radio signal it wouldnt transmit
anything until it was time to detonate

PARRISH
The radio was set to trigger the other
bombs if it stopped transmitting -- so
with your solution all three bombs go up
If you disarmed the one you had in hand by
cutting the explosives but leaving the
transmitter alone youd stop all of them

Harry slides the check back and shakes his head --

HARRY
What if it wasnt a master timer What if
each cart had its own timer

PARRISH
Unlikely since Faes need perfect
synchronization But if thats the case --
(shrugs)
Cut the explosives and stop the one you
can

HARRY
You call that a solution All you can do
is lose by different degrees

PARRISH
Zero solution Choose and lose
Strategically its the best way to go
(looks up to Diane)
What do you think honey

Parrishs wife DIANE PARRISH a luminous intelligent woman
slides into the booth next to him with a Washington Post Their
body language tells us how happy they are to see each other and
that theyve been together for years

DIANE
That you both think about this stuff way
too much
(sees she has no food)
Wheres mine Tom
PARRISH
Your blueberry pie is on the way Be sure
to thank Harry Hes paying as usual

DIANE
Cant you two take turns on the check
like normal people

PARRISH
No That way Id have to pay sometimes

Harry hands a twenty to the waitress and turns to Diane

HARRY

I hope hes not this arrogant at home
DIANE

You have no idea
HARRY

Well we can sit here dreaming up bullshit

scenarios thatll never happen Or --
(points to newspaper)

-- we could all get on the clock and stop

a sure thing before it does

On the table we see the Posts front page CHEMICAL WEAPONS
INCINERATION PLANT GOES ON LINE THIS WEEK -- and we CUT TO

EXT BOYNE LAKE - DAY - OUTSIDE THE DINER - A FEDERAL ISSUE JEEP

is parked curbside Harry heads to it looking across the
street at a small park There a blond six year old GIRL is
swinging a plastic bat at a plastic ball tossed her by her
FATHER The bat connects and the ball sails up and up --

-- well just three feet up Enough to keep it from a diapered
two year old BOY who runs after it The girl showboats like she
hit a homer in the series leaning on her bat and miming a big
yawn while waiting for the ball to come back She smiles at --

-- Harry He waves back as Diane arrives

DIANE
Shes pretty cocky

HARRY
The shortstop didnt have a chance He had
the sun in his eyes and a load in his

pants
Diane watches Harry oddly -- carefully --- and decides to ask --
DIANE
Hows Kaylie doing
Harrys smile slips a notch --
HARRY

Adjusting
(opens jeep door)
Lets finish this thing so we can go home
A MOMENT LATER - THE JEEP DRIVES OUT OF THE SMALL TOWN

Its an idyllic slice of Americana that could have come from a
Norman Rockwell painting except for one thing --

-- there are warning sirens on every corner with bright signs
advising what to do in the event of an Agent Release

FOLLOWING THE JEEP OUT OF TOWN

as it drives down dusty roads past the main industry of the
area small cattle and sheep ranches -- we go inside --

INSIDE THE JEEP - HARRY

is driving Parrish is in the front and Diane is in back
reading the newspaper Parrish looks over at her smiling --

PARRISH
You spent five dollars to get the only
Washington Post in three counties and all
you keep is the real estate section

DIANE
Somebody lied to me Somebody told me that
my life was going to get more comfortable
after I married the boss

(poring over listings)

Living on the boat was supposed to be
temporary Its been a year now and the
Potomac is slowly slowly losing its charm

Harry looks at the farms and the incongruously placed sirens

HARRY
You two could always relocate here Six
acres two horses and a free warning
siren If it doesnt work you get your
money back
(shaking his head)
Why the hell does anybody live here

PARRISH
You could say that about Washington too
(beat)
Its just as dangerous there Its just
that the sirens dont show

TRAVELLING SHOT - THE BOYNE LAKE CHEMICAL WEAPONS DISPOSAL PLANT

-- the buildings smokestacks and half-buried concrete storage
igloos are surrounded by fencing and armed guards

At the gate Harry flashes their WCSD IDS -- and Diane looks
at the smokestacks angrily Fumes are pouring out of them
DIANE
Theyve already gone on line

(beat)
Those bastards have already gone hot

cuT TO
INT THE PLANTS LOBBY - IN A CHEERY PUBLIC AREA

decorated with a diagram of the centers inner workings twenty
local CITIZENS are gathered A PR man JIM ENRIGHT hired for
his military bearing is reassuring them

ENRIGHT
To win the Cold War for our children and
grandchildren -- the US Army built fifty
thousand missiles containing nerve agent
(smiles a little)

It worked We won And thankfully not a
single one of these missiles ever had to
be fired against an opponent Now Boyne
Lake has been chosen to finish the job --
by destroying the stockpile of missiles

UPSTAIRS - IN A MAIN OFFICE - THROUGH A WINDOW

Diane angrily looks out at the PR briefing Elsewhere are
Parrish Harry and the plants irritated operator ROY MEYERS
He looks over the documents handed to him --

MEYERS
“Worst Case Scenario Directorate --
(lowers them)
-- what the hell is that A federal agency
designed to screw things up

PARRISH

The names self-explanatory We were
activated by the NSA twenty years ago to
identify potential catastrophes or targets
for terrorist attack Kind of a think tank

(beat)
We didnt have to think too hard to find
all the problems here Youve got ten
thousand missiles with degrading explosive
components stacked in concrete igloos
that arent strong enough to contain the
inevitable explosion

(beat)
You dont have enough safety features on
this plant for containment or warning

MEYERS
I dont have to put up with this --

HARRY

Actually you do We have oversight
authority over any federal agency once
weve found a threat to national security
And thats just what we have here

beat )
According to our simulations youll have
equipment failure and toxin release in the
first month killing three hundred to five
thousand people depending on the wind

MEYERS
I cleared everything through the Army the
EPA and the state
MEYERS
Every day we sit idle is a million-six to
the government I know wasting tax dollars
means zip to a bureaucrat but I take it
seriously --

Diane still looks down at the briefingmassage full of
laughing relieved locals Diane disgusted turns to Meyers --

DIANE

Your flack looks like hes selling ice
cream Is he explaining that every one of
those missiles is a time bomb that could
explode by itself in ten years or ten
minutes ane you cant tell which is which

hot
Or is he explaining how our little
deterrent worked That if a cloud of toxin
blew out of here the corrosives would
dissolve their skin to make it easier for
the neural agent to shred their nervous
systems

MEYERS
(condescending)
It is horrible stuff Ms Parrish Thats
why were getting rid of it you know
(looks to Parrish)
Were on line and Im busy so I suggest
you take your wife back to Washington --

Parrish stands a little angry but trying to keep control --

PARRISH

The EPA inspector who cleared this place
was indicted last week for taking bribes
from an oil refinery he also inspected

(beat)
He wouldnt say if anything was off here
but I didnt like the way his eye twitched
when I asked him about it

(stares at Meyers)
You know -- the way yours is now

(beat)
If your secondary safety systems are in
place well leave quietly If they
arent and Im pretty sure they arent
you can start explaining what happened to
forty million dollars the government paid
for backup systems that you didnt install

Meyers face drains bone-white as Diane and Harry file out This
is his worst case scenario” playing out Parrish stops --

PARRISH
One last thing
(beat)
You shouldnt have called my wife ms
She really really hates that

Parrish shuts the door and moves into --
THE PLANTS HALLWAY - FOLLOWING PARRISH DIANE AND HARRY
Parrish turns to Diane as they walk through --

PARRISH
If you take over the control room while
Harry and I suit up well be gone by --

DIANE

Whoa whoa -- the protocol for the
inspection is that you take over the
control room If we dont do this by the
book Meyers11l find a legal way to toss
out the inspection and keep this plant
running Harry and I can handle it

(Parrish starts to protest)
Inspections like this are my job You just
hold up your end okay

Parrish finally he gives in smiling a little At a door reading
PROTECTIVE SUIT PREPARATION Harry leads Diane in --

HARRY
Dont worry Tom Just put on your
thinking cap because Ive got a beaut
Youre going to pick up the lunch check
for a change

PARRISH
(smiles)
Not a chance Ive got the worst one yet --
(taps forehead)
-- all ready to go

CUT TO
INT PLANT CONTROL ROOM - DAY - TECHNICIANS ARE WORKING

over computers and video monitors showing every phase of the
largely automated missile destruction plant Their work ends as
Parrish enters with a seething Meyers to take over

PARRISH
Ladies -- gentlemen -- this is a full
plant inspection Power down the
disassemblers the furnace missile
transport everything I want this plant
ice cold right now

The technicians look to Meyers who nods --

INSIDE THE PLANT - A METAL PARTS FURNACE

that runs hot enough to turn steel into soup shuts down --

A robotic disassembler stops unscrewing missile components --

In a missile transport tunnel missiles are moved in a container
thats twenty feet high and ten feet wide from silo to plant
The rail system halts -- as --
INSIDE THE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - A MISSILE CONTAINER

is there loaded with twenty stacked rockets Theyre brought
here to be moved by human workers to the conveyor that takes
them to the disassembler and ultimately the furnaces Two
WORKERS in protective suits shut the container door locking the
missiles in As they do a GRINDING SOUND brings us to --

OUTSIDE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - A STEEL VAULT DOOR

GRINDS OPEN allowing the men to walk out as we CUT TO
INT THE CONTROL ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The room has half as many technicians as before and many of the
systems have been shut down Parrish is standing over --

THE VIDEO MONITORS

show two shaky moving POV shots from Diane and Harrys hazmat
suits on monitors labelled MOBILE 1 and MOBILE 2 Another room
monitor shows a long surveillance shot labelled MISSILE STORAGE
SILO ONE with two figures moving down a ladder

The MOBILE 1 monitor shows the POV of a man climbing down a
ladder -- but it halts veering over to a warning sign that is
a huge NO with a dozen prohibitions alongside it --

HARRY (ON RADIO)
No Smoking -- No Machinery -- No
Forklifts I think they forgot a couple --

INSIDE THE MISSILE STORAGE SILO - HARRY AND DIANE

are halfway down the ladder into this enormous dank tower

There is only scant lighting -- just enough to show that the
silo is filled from a floor fifty feet below to a ceiling

fifty feet above with missiles stacked like cordwood in racks

HARRY
No Walking Fast In Corduroy Pants No
Shuffling Your Feet On Shag Carpeting
No Rubbing A Balloon On Your Head
(shines light around)
One spark and this place1ll make Bhopal
look like a birthday party

PARRISH (ON RADIO)
Is it as bad as we thought

Harry shines the light the missiles stacked in racks are
ut and oozing rocket fuel or the liquefied nerve agent

HARRY
Worse Much worse
(shines light on puddles)
I forgot the chemistry on this -- does the
nerve agent make the rocket fuel more
explosive does the rocket fuel make the
nerve agent more toxic or is it both
A MOMENT LATER - INSIDE THE MISSILE TRANSPORT TUNNEL

-- one of the huge missile transport containers is there on
rails Harry walks with Diane who has a mobile testing unit

DIANE
This tunnel is flooded with gas -- the
floor is coated with toxin residue --

As Diane walks she stares so intently at her monitor she
stumbles -- but Harry catches her arm and helps her up

PARRISH (ON RADIO)
Are your suits all right Any tears

HARRY (ON RADIO)
Negative -- suits are intact Proceeding
into explosion containment room --

Harry and Diane reach the end of the tunnel Harry unlatches and
manually opens a huge sliding door that leads into --

THE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM

is enormous and lined with steel fixtures This is a room
designed for the most dangerous part of this operation manual
unloading of missiles to a conveyor belt that stretches across
the room to take the missiles to a disassembler

Harry and Diane move in past the missile container on the
track its a thick metal case the size of a diving bell Glass
ports reveal there are twenty missiles inside it

IN CONTROL ROOM - PARRISH

is rattled This place surpasses his worst fears

HARRY (ON RADIO)
-- entering Explosion Containment Chamber

We HOLD on Parrishs face as we --

DISSOLVE TO
THE CONTROL ROOM - LATER - PARRISH
looks even more ragged -- an hour has passed Parrish looks down
at the video monitors Harry is in the METAL FURNACE ROOM
while Diane is in the EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM

HARRY (ON RADIO)
Theres no backup system just a primary --

IN THE FURNACE ROOM - HARRY
is gingerly checking the wiring on a junction box --
HARRY

-- a primary I might add that looks like
it was installed by Mister Magoo

INSIDE THE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - DIANE

is alone in the room testing the wires in the system --
DIANE
Its the same thing here Bet he saved
twenty million on construction
INSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM - PARRISH
looks at Meyers angry and disgusted --
PARRISH
You son of a bitch You should just blow
this place sky-high and get it over with
(back to radio)
Inspections over --
INSIDE THE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - DIANE
finishes putting the plate back on the box she examined

PARRISH (ON RADIO)
-- lets get the hell out of here

Diane starts to walk across the room -- but as she does we see

THE FRONT OF THE MISSILE CONTAINER - ARMORED GLASS PORTS

are cut into the container The glass reveals something is
glowing It begins sparking -- and it finally explodes --

- the door of the missile transport container is BLASTED OPEN
and OFF -- one of the missiles uto-ignited and fir
the container through th ter of the room --

-- Diane hurls herself backwards -- as the missile partially

detonates -- the nerve agent starts leaking out of the casing in
a small but building yellow cloud And worst of all --

-- the shock collapses the missile container -- the two dozen
missiles spill out rolling around and sparking --

-- Diane throws herself back further into the room as --

THE VAULT DOOR STARTS TO AUTOMATICALLY CRANK SHUT

-- in seconds itll be sealed off -- as --
IN THE CONTROL ROOM - CLOSE ON PARRISHS FACE

-- he stares at the monitors in shock and grabs the radio as
parts of the control panel short out --

PARRISH
-- Diane -- Diane --

IN THE FURNACE ROOM - HARRY

hears the EXPLOSIONS on the other side and runs out - as --
IN THE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - DIANE IS SURROUNDED BY FIRES

as she struggles to her feet Her suit has a small tear -- she
holds it shut as she stumbles out through the missiles --

-- but the vault door slams shut in her face

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VAULT DOOR - HARRY RUNS TO STOP IT

- but the bolts lock in place Harry looks at the porthole in
the door the glass distorts Dianes face but not her fear --

HARRY (INTO RADIO)
-- Tom -- Dianes locked in there -- the
vault doors shut and wont open --
(hears only static in reply)
-- do you read me

INSIDE CONTROL ROOM - PARRISH

gapes at the monitors and listens to his wife scream in terror
the radio now broken up by a barrage of static --

DIANE (INTO RADIO)
- get me out of here -- my suits torn

and theres gas leaking here -- Tom --
PARRISH
(yells at technician)
-- Open the vault door -- now damnit --
TECHNICIAN

I cant -- that doors supposed to seal if
theres a leak and theres no override --

ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VAULT DOOR - HARRY

takes apart the doors controls -- hes removed his gloves and
helmet to work faster --

PARRISH (INTO RADIO)
-- Harry -- get at the doors local con--

HARRY (INTO RADIO)
cuts him off intense)
-- Already on it --
INSIDE THE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - THE ROLLING MISSILES

are sparking and colliding amongst the fires -- the yellow gas
has filled the room --

Diane trapped looks for an escape that isnt there -- as --
IN THE CONTROL ROOM - PARRISH

is desperate but thinking as fast as he ever has --

TECHNICIAN
-- theres maybe one minute before those
missiles go -- if it spreads to the silos

were fuckin barbecued - everyone is --

PARRISH
We wont let that happen -- where are the
halon extinguishers In the ceiling

TECHNICIAN

Theyre fried --

Parrish looks over the controls his mind racing -- and the
solution comes to him A solution no one would want to face

PARRISH
(calm almost quiet)
You have pyro cleansers in that room They
can bring it up to two thousand degrees

TECHNICIAN
Yeah for burning off residues -- but --
(realizing with horror)
-- holy fuck
PARRISH

See if theyre operational Right now

Parrish reeling moves to the monitors As the technician
checks the controls Meyers comes up to him apoplectic --

MEYERS
He wants you to set off a dozen flame
throwers in a room full of leaky missiles
The whole placell go up --

TECHNICIAN
No -- its the only way left to keep the
whole plant from exploding Itll be like
dropping a nitro charge on an oil fire --
(Low)
-- but his wife is still in there

The technician keys a program PYRO CLEANSE CYCLE - READY --
HIGH ANGLE - EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - SIX JET NOZZLES

lower from the ceiling and eight more protrude from the walls
unnoticed by Diane as she pounds weakly on the door --

HARRY SEES THIS THROUGH THE PORTHOLE
- and realizing what it means works faster --
PARRISH LOOKS AT THE VIDEO SHOT OF DIANE

which shows early corrosive effects on her face --

DIANE (INTO RADIO)
(weak raspy)

-- Tom -- gas is getting into the suit --
get me out -- please get me out --
PARRISH
(shaky)

Harry -- can you get that door open

AT THE VAULT DOOR - HARRY
is rewiring as quickly as he can --
HARRY (INTO RADIO)
-- I know what youre gonna do but
wait --Ive almost got it open --

IN THE CONTROL ROOM - PARRISH

cant make out the reply -- its nothing but static --
PARRISH
-- say again -- can you get th oor en

AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VAULT DOOR - HARRY

frantically rewires the door controls -- through the radio
Static all Harry could make out is the word door --

HARRY (INTO RADIO)
-- cant read you -- Ive almost bypassed
the door -- wait for me --

IN THE CONTROL ROOM - PARRISH LISTENS INTENTLY

as the staticy reply comes through -- here it sounds like
HARRY (FROM RADIO)
-- cant --
(static)
-- bypass --
(static)
-- door --
Parrish is shattered -- he looks down at Dianes monitor Even

in the vague reflection of the glass he can see her face is
distorting with effects of the gas as is her rasping voice --

DIANE
-- Tom -- please -- please get me out --

Parrish numbly looks at all the monitors the one that shows
Diane dying -- the one that shows the missiles are on fire and
ready to explode -- and the one under the keyboard that shows
PYRO CLEANSE CYCLE IN EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM START YN
Parrish is frozen --
PARRISH

(quietly to himself)
Zero solution

Parrish puts his hand on Dianes video monitor -- the last
contact hell ever have with her -- and keys the microphone --
PARRISH
Diane -- honey --
(beat)

-- I found a way to get you out

14
Parrish reaches for the keyboard his finger quivering -- he
shuts his eyes -- pushes the ENTER key -- and --

INSIDE THE EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM - THE JET NOZZLES BLAST

across -- the room is instantaneously filled with fire --

FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VAULT DOOR - HARRY
backs away from the door in shock -- through the porthole the
white hot flames show the outline of Dianes body but it is
obscured an instant later disappearing in the fire as bright
and blinding as a nuclear flash -- while --
IN THE CONTROL ROOM - CLOSE ON PARRISHS FACE
as he numbly starts to realize what hes done -- he looks at --
THE MONITORS
Dianes monitor MOBILE 2 has cut to static -- while the
EXPLOSION CONTAINMENT ROOM monitor shows the flames are going
out as suddenly as they started when the jets are cut off
TECHNICIAN

It worked -- the fire burnt off the oxygen

in the room It cant spread to the silo --
But as soon as this is said --
INSIDE THE MISSILE TRANSPORT TUNNEL - THE FLOOR
is scattered with still-burning metal embers blasted in --

-- an ember FLARES igniting a trail of fuel under a missile
transport container in the tunnel -- the container EXPLODES --

INTO THE MISSILE STORAGE SILO - FIRE BURSTS INTO THE SILO

-- the fuel on the floor IGNITES under the missiles -- as --
INSIDE THE PLANT - HARRY

hears the dull muffled BOOM of an EXPLOSION from the silos --
IN THE CONTROL ROOM - PARRISH HEARS THE EXPLOSION

rippling through the walls of the plant -- worse he feels the
shock of realizing that what he just did was for nothing --

IN THE STORAGE SILO - THE FLAMES RACE UP THE MISSILE STACKS

-- and the missiles explode up in a building chain reaction --
ELSEWHERE IN THE PLANT - HARRY RUNS FOR HIS LIFE

toward a containment door that is grinding closed -- as --

THE EXPLOSION BLASTS THE CONTAINMENT VAULT DOOR OFF

and it blasts down the hall like a cannonball with a cloud of
gas behind it right after Harry --

-- Harry dives the last few feet into the containment door --
just as it slams shut the vault door SMASHES against the
containment door with a tremendous BANG -- but it HOLDS --

ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE DOOR - HARRY

takes a deep breath relieved hes getting nothing but air --
but the continuing growing BOOMS tell the story --

IN THE MISSILE STORAGE SILO - THE CHAIN REACTION
races up in a large BLAST t blows off the to £ the silo --
ON THE ROOF OF THE PLANT - PARRISH

emerges in the open air Three hundred yards away from him the
silo blasts apart and a huge cloud billows out --

Parrish moves to the edge of the roof closer to the cloud He
not only isnt afraid he seems to want it to come for him --

PARRISH
Break this way you bastard -- this way --

But the wind is at Parrishs back -- the cloud is building and
being driven toward the valley and the town While --

IN THE TOWNS MAIN UARE - IN THE PARK - KIDS

still play no-rules baseball as old men talk on park benches
The alarms are silent But a man on a bench points --

-- the THUNDER-like echo of the explosion is just reaching them
and a yellow cloud blows irreversibly towards them

ON THE FACES OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE

-- each reacts with shock disbelief and fear What they were
told wouldnt happen couldnt happen -- is happening As --

ON THE PLANT ROOF - PARRISH

has a scenic view of the clouds progress -- it is fed by the
fire and it hangs together like fog as it approaches --

ON THE EDGE OF THE TOWN - PICKUP TRUCKS CAUGHT ON THE HIGHWAY

turn around to to outrun it but they are overtaken by the
cloud Every car veers crazily before crashing into a ditch --

-- birds fall from the sky -- cattle are caught in the cloud --
INSIDE THE TOWN - THE GAS CLOUD DESCENDS UPON THE TOWN

People caught outside run but fall enshrouded in the gas --
ON THE PLANT ROOF - PARRISH

numbly looks down as the cloud covers the town and the SOUNDS

of the disaster emerge -- horns honking people shouting all
merging into one loud shriek you can hear miles away --
INSIDE THE PLANT - HARRY RUNS TO A WINDOW

and sees that their worst fears have come to pass shouting --

HARRY
-- NoQOOO0O --
Harry POUNDS the glass in anger and frustration -- and the

POUNDING segues to that of a POUNDING GAVEL as we --

DISSOLVE TO
EXT WASHINGTON DC - THE SENATE BUILDING - DAY
The GAVEL fades -- and we hear a voice --

EVERETT (0S)
Please state your name and occupation

HEARINGS CHAMBER - HARRY IS ON THE STAND

grimly enduring the questioning of SENATOR EVERETT -- a
politician who is clearly out to pin the blame for this event on
Parrish and win as much publicity for himself as he can

HARRY
Harold Macneill I am a disaster
mitigation engineer for the Worst Case
Scenario Directorate

EVERETT
Thats a very fancy title Mr Macneill
I take it then that your job is to
identify and prevent possible disasters --
not to cause new ones yourself

HARRY
(stone)
That is correct When I took the job I
had no idea that most of my time would be
spent trying to prevent disasters caused
by our own government Sir

Amid MURMURING in the hearings chamber Everett shifts gears

EVERETT

Then tell me Mr Macneill more about
your efforts of prevention at Boyne Lake

(beat)
When Mr Parrish chose to flood a room
full of explosives material with fire
causing the disaster did you advise
against it

HARRY
The disaster was unavoid --

EVERETT
Yes or no Mr Macneill

HARRY
His actions did not cause the --

EVERETT
Yes or no Mr Macneill -- did you advise
him to not flood that room with fire

Harry reluctantly gives the only answer he can

HARRY
Yes

LATER - HEARINGS CHAMBER - PARRISH
is erect at a table We cant see his face as the GAVEL POUNDS

EVERETT (0S)
Mister Parrish
(insistent)
-- Mister Parrish

Parrish looks up He has aged five years in as many weeks
Everett levels a calculated look of contempt at Parrish

EVERETT
Mister Parrish As a man who took an oath
twenty years ago to protect this
country --
(sharp)
-- I would like to ask you -- why did you
cause the Boyne Lake catastrophe

Parrish doesnt rattle at all -- he levels a stare at Everett

PARRISH
The plants contractor caused that
accident months before we got there If
Id never walked in everything would have
happened exactly the same way

EVERETT
Is it not true Mr Parrish that you --
(consults notes)

-- told Mr Meyers that the plant ought to
be blown sky-high

There is an astonished MURMUR from the crowd --

PARRISH
That is correct

EVERETT
Is it not true Mr Parrish that you
actually ignited a fire in a room full of
highly volatile missiles

PARRISH
It is true and I did that to extinquish
a fire that was already burning inside --

EVERETT
Extinguish You extinguished an entire
town Mr Parrish and I dont see the
slightest remorse for your actions --

PARRISH
-- for what Trying to save people

Parrishs voice RISES slightly because there is loud savage
SHOUTING from the gallery crowd and Everetts banging GAVEL --

EVERETT
Are you telling me that your actions were
proper That if you were to live over
again a day that brought the deaths of
three hundred and twelve people you would
take every action as you did

The first slight crack appears in Parrishs unnerving calm -- an
undercurrent of anger simmering in his face

PARRISH

Your counts off It was three hundred and
thirteen people I lost my wife

(building anger)
No I didnt lose my wife I incinerated
her because it was the one chance I had
to try to save the lives of thousands of
people And you sit there and ask me if I
would make such a choice again

(certain slow)
The answer is yes I would take every
single action precisely as I did that day

That tears it for the CROWD -- some start SHOUTING murderer
burn in hell -- but in the center of it --

CLOSE ON PARRISHS FACE

He isnt reacting to the feral hatred being directed at him
With a cold angry glare he is directing his own hatred at

HARRY

who is staring back pityingly As the SHOUTING goes on we --
CUT TO

INT THE MACNEILL TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT - A CHILDS BEDROOM

An elderly English nanny MAGGIE tucks in a sleeping three year
old girl KAYLIE MACNEILL The room is conspicuously full of
photos of a mother who is just as conspicuously absent

Maggie backs into the hallway of a townhouse with a Potomac
view We HEAR TV news from a study She walks in and finds
Harry watching the news Over clips of testimony we hear --

REPORTER (ON TELEVISION)
-- statement from the White House
confirmed their view that the tragedy was
caused by Parrish Despite warnings from
co-worker Harry Macneill Parrish
deliberately --

MAGGIE
You should say goodnight to Kaylie She
doesnt understand whats happening but
she knows somethings wrong --

HARRY
Look at this Its a lynching

The news shifts to a man-on-the-street bit as people spew
hatred at Parrish The phone RINGS -- the machine answers it --

PARRISH (ON MACHINE)
In todays performance the part of Marcus
Brutus will be played by Harry Macneill

Harry hits the mute on the TV and snatches up the phone --

HARRY
Tom where are you I looked for you --

INT POTOMAC RIVER - A TWENTY-FIVE FOOT BOAT - PARRISH

paces around the cabin Small touches like photos of Diane

TRUCKER
Hey -- you in charge here
The man in the shack ambles out -- it is Harry unshaven

unsteady and looking pretty raw Hes wearing grimy overalls
with tools in one side and a pint of whiskey in the other

HARRY
Thats me Nobody elsed take the job

TRUCKER
I need you to sign this for me
HARRY
Again This has to be the tenth damn

TRUCKER

Thats government work Those guys
couldnt find their asses with both hands

The trucker is put off by Harrys pathetic look

TRUCKER

touch the stuff before noon

You have one for me though pal

Both drivers get into their cabs and drive away leaving behind
their unhitched trailers Harry waves as they leave --

tosses the bottle and walks over to a trailer --

trucking and the metal work for melting
them Problem is they keep falling off
the trucks a box at a time and guns that
were destroyed end up back on the street

done a thing about it even though anybody
could take every gun any time they wanted

Harry angry picks up on the hesitation in the last word

Rachel

HARRY
And what does the Bureau think of my
speculation

RACHEL

They think youre --
(searches for word)

-- easily excitable

HARRY
No They think Ima pain in the ass for
telling the world that they have security
protocols a six year old could beat

Guess they think highly of you too to
hand you a glamor job like this

Nobody hopes Im wrong more than I do

The helicopter flies up the twists of the Tennessee River

passing different dams scattered through the rivers branches

They are flying up the grade toward the mountain sources
INSIDE HELICOPTER - HARRY AND RACHEL
lean toward one another shouting to be heard

RACHEL
Thats the eleventh one weve looked at
(beat)
You still think someones planted an
atomic bomb in one of these dams

HARRY
Worse

RACHEL
(taken aback)
What do you mean worse I mean what the
hell could be worse than that

HARRY
You know how hard it is to take
plutonium -- even highly refined weapons
grade stuff -- and make a bomb out of it

(beat)
Even guys with training would have a hard
time making an operational nuke without
the right equipment and metals and
theyre even harder to get than plutonium
(shakes head)
Odds of someone detonating an actual home-
made nuclear bomb are close to zero

Harry looks glum Rachel still doesnt see where hes headed

RACHEL
I dont want to be dense -- for the last
year Ive been dealing with rednecks
trying to turn bullshit into bombs -- but
my experience is that when we dont have
a workable device thats a good thing

HARRY
The buttons are made of powder pressed
together from reactor waste One grain
would kill you if it got into your body
The buttons have millions of grains --
(points down)
-- and theyre water soluble

Rachel finally catches on -- and is speechless
HARRY
So if you had a supply of the most toxic
stuff on earth -- something that would be
radioactive for twenty-four thousand
years -- and you were feeling a little

naughty how would you maximize lethality

RACHEL
That river feeds into the water supply of
the entire state Itd kill thousands --

HARRY
Four hundred to six hundred thousand in
two years Over a million in five years
After it got all the way into the national
food chain itd kill three million in ten
years

The cold actuarial precision of the answer shocks Rachel

RACHEL
How do you know all that

Something too dark to be a smile passes over Harrys face

HARRY
Didnt your pals at the Bureau tell you
Im the expert I kill more people before
nine am than most people do all day
(beat)
We ran a risk assessment simulation four
years ago for exactly this situation

RACHEL
If you know all that -- then you know how
to stop it Right

Right

rises up hundreds of feet from the river to contain a huge
mountaintop lake -- but on the road that runs across the dam --

- the security fence is smashed -- three dam guards lie face
down in a pool of blood

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - HARRY AND RACHEL

realize simultaneously that this has already begun Harry grabs
the radio and Rachel arcs the copter to the side

A MOMENT LATER - THE HELICOPTER HAS LANDED

in a wooded area by the dam property -- Rachel points at the dam
wall which has visible wiring and packets of plastique

RACHEL
Theyve wired the wall to explode

HARRY
Thats why they picked this dam
(off her blank look)
High ground If they blow that wall
millions of tons of water will smash
through that river and blow out every dam
downstream in a chain reaction

HARRY
(beat)
Half the statell be flooded and theyll
never get the plutonium out of the water

Rachel checks her gun and hands Harry one from a compartment
He takes it as if hes never held a gun in his life -- but
theres no choice Theyre the only two who can stop this

A MOMENT LATER - AT THE GATES OF THE DAM - HARRY AND RACHEL

are stealthily moving past the gate in the growing darkness --
before they split up Harry urgently motions Rachel back --

HARRY
Wait -- if you find some of the hot
canisters whatever you do dont expose
the plutonium outside its casing ---

RACHEL
(sharp)
Im not an idiot Macneill --

HARRY

(backs down a little)
Okay okay -- I know every seventh grader
knows what happens if two exposed blocks
of plutonium touch but I figured it cant
hurt to remind you

INT THE SPILLWAYS VERTICAL MAINTENANCE SHAFT - HARRY CLIMBS IN
and climbs down The maintenance shaft which is twenty feet in
diameter starts at the spillway on top and runs in an inverted
T down to the pipe Its sixty feet deep and the only way up
or down is an elevator thats just a cage hooked up to a pulley
and a counterweight running along the side

ON TOP OF THE DAMS ROADWAY - RACHEL

approaches the control tower thats on the west side of the
dam -- she kicks her way into a door -- and --

INSIDE THE TOWER - RACHEL STEPS INTO A HALL

leading to the control room holding her gun up adrenaline
running high She moves past dead guards on the floor --

IN THE CONTROL ROOM - A MILITIA MEMBER
is at a row of controls for the dams operations and wires from

outside lead to a detonator Hes waiting for a signal and in
away he gets one he hears Rachels approach --

RACHEL
Dont move Put down your gun

The militia member lunges for the detonator -- and Rachel fires
three shots hitting him dead center He goes down dead

Rachel is shocked -- this is the first time shes ever killed
someone She moves to the detonator and yanks wires as --

INSIDE THE MAINTENANCE PIPE - HARRY CLIMBS DOWN THE LADDER
to explore the pipe -- but behind him --

JOSHUA (0S)
Put the gun down And kick it away

The militia leader JOSHUA steps out of the opposite side of
the pipe He is large and muscular and his eyes tell us how
committed he is to this insanity Hanging off one shoulder is a
knapsack which has three plutonium canisters clanking in it --
and hanging off the other is a machine gun

JOSHUA
Youre too late I opened the gate

Joshua motions with the gun and Harry with no choice kicks
the gun away -- we can hear it CLATTER down hundreds of feet of
pipe Joshua pulls out a canister and Harry tenses --

HARRY
Do you have any idea whatll happen if you
open those up in here

JOSHUA
(calmly)
I do understand I understand your fear
(holds canister)
Only evil men designated by God will
perish

At the far end of the pipe there is a high pitched SCREECH --
THE FLOODGATE IS CRANKING OPEN SLOWLY - WATER CRASHES THROUGH

the gate as it opens wider -- its already a torrent but within
moments the whole pipe will be filled -- while

AT THE PIPES BEND - HARRY AND JOSHUA

Desperate Harry knows from the sound that this is it Joshua
reacts not with fear but the look of a proud martyr

HARRY
Youre going to kill millions -- what God
would want that

JOSHUA

The one who wants Satans own creation to
scour the Earth of unholy men --

With that the water arrives -- the torrent is knee deep and
rising fast Joshua goes limp and is swept down with the bag --

-- but Harry cant let it happen -- he lunges across the water
flow allowing himself to be taken in the growing current --

-- just as Joshua clutching the open knapsack is about to be
swept over the vertical edge of the pipe Harry reaches him and
grabs the other strap on the knapsack with one hand --

-- with the other hand Harry grabs a high ridge -- he has to
support himself against the wateras well as Joshuas weight --

IN THE CURRENT - JOSHUA

yanks against Harrys grip on the bag bracing against the pipe

as tons of water wash over them -- ultimately --
-- the bag is torn from Harrys grip -- Joshua and the bag wash
ever the side -- Joshua vanishes from view but --

-- because of the slack caused by the tug-of-wars end Joshua
pulls too hard on the bag -- he loses his grip and the bag is
flung backwards end over end to the upper side of the pipe --

THE KNAPSACKS STRAP CATCHES THE METALWORK

that hangs at the top of the vertical drop over the water --

-- the open bag hangs precariously over the water swinging with
the weight of the casks clanking back and forth --

CLOSE ON HARRY HANGING ON THE SIDE OF THE PIPE

Harry looks up at the bag -- hell never be able to reach it
and within moments the bag will swing off on its own or the
water will reach full force and knock it off

With no other choice Harry climbs back to the maintenance
opening -- the water is knee deep and rising fast -- but --

IN THE VERTICAL SECTION OF THE PIPE BELOW - JOSHUA

is still alive clinging to a maintenance ladder While --
INSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM - RACHEL CLOSES THE FLOODGATE

with the panel controls but just as she finishes she sees --
- a third militia member is heading toward the river wall

ON THE ROADWAY - THE THIRD MILITIA MEMBER

is moving with determination toward the wall that drops over to
the river -- but there as he gets closer to the wall --

THREE MILITARY ATTACK HELICOPTERS RISE OVER THE WALLS EDGE

steadying himself on the elevators cable to reach the local
control box -- he reaches the EMGCY SHUTDOWN GATE 1 switch --
ANGLE DOWN INTO VERTICAL SECTION OF PIPE - THE KNAPSACK SWINGS

on top ready to fall -- one hundred feet below the emergency
gate two semicircles of steel slowly grind to a close --

BENEATH THE KNAPSACK - JOSHUA CLINGS TO THE LADDER
in the pipe -- he takes his gun and fires up at the bag --
THE BAG IS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS

and is torn to shreds -- the three canisters of plutonium fall
toward the still-open gate clanging past Joshua and down to --

THE CLOSING GATE - THE PLUTONIUM CANISTERS LAND

-- one two and three on the gate as it grinds shut -- it has
twelve inches left to go as the canisters bounce around --

-- one canister comes to rest on the right edge another gets
caught safely on the opposite edge -- but the last of the water
sweeps the third canister into the closing gate --

-- as the canister catches in the last couple of inches of the
doorway -- the force of the door crushes the metal canister --

-- the gate finally grinds to a complete close but one of the
plutonium buttons is now dangerously exposed -- as above --

FROM AN ATTACK HELICOPTER GUNNERS POV - RACHEL IS RUNNING

out onto the roadway gun in one hand FBI identification held
high in the other -- the gunner almost shoots but stops --

GUNNER
-- shes one of ours --

Meanwhile the third militia member is in the spillway -- one of
the copters hovers over him mercilessly firing down --

IN THE CONCRETE SPILLWAY - THE MILITIA MEMBER
staggers forward Hes been shot many times but fanaticism is

holding him up He lurches toward the maintenance shaft that
leads into the main drain and hes unscrewing the canister --

- Rachel sees this and runs toward him as --

THE MILITIA MEMBER FALLS TO THE CONCRETE

in a lifeless heap -- but he releases the canister which rolls
away toward the maintenance shaft --

RACHEL IS RIGHT BEHIND THE CANISTER

running for all shes worth but the spillway is inclined --

picking up speed almost to the edge -- as below --

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MAINTENANCE SHAFT - HARRY

fire RICOCHETS all over -- Harry ducks and turns to see --
-- Joshua is moving up firing his gun at Harry -- as above --

ON TOP OF THE MAINTENANCE SHAFT - THE LOOSE CANISTER

rolls just toward the edge -- Rachel is right behind She dives
for it -- her fingers brush it --

-- and she misses -- the canister is falling in -- as below --
IN THE MAINTENANCE SHAFT - HARRY
looks up to see his worst nightmare -- the canister is falling

into the shaft toward him - it collides against one segment of
the wall and it breaks apart exposing the piutonium --

Harry crouches as a hail of bullets blaze around him -- hes
terrified not just because of the plutonium coming down or the
bullets coming up but because of what hes about to do --

-- gripping the cable Harry yanks out the linchpin that holds
the elevator to the cable -- without the elevators weight
holding it the counterweight drops from the top --

-- and it yanks the cable upward pulling Harry behind it --
ANGLE DOWN - HARRY SHOOTS UP THE SHAFT ON THE CABLE

as bullets SPARK around him and he passes the plutonium
bouncing around the shaft on its way down -- until --

AT THE TOP OF THE MAINTENANCE SHAFT - HARRY

is jerked to a halt when the cable LOCKS at the shafts edge
but Rachel is there to help him onto the concrete -- as --

INSIDE THE PIPE - THE ELEVATOR CAGE FALLS AWAY
from its runners and into the pipe tumbling toward Joshua --
-- Joshua tangles in the cage as it falls back into the vertical

shaft -- Joshua and the cage CRASH sixty feet down against the
emergency gate by the fallen plutonium buttons --
- the falling button bounces right behind it -- as --
ON TOP OF THE MAINTENANCE SHAFT - HARRY
is dazed but theres no time to waste He yanks Rachel away --

HARRY
Run --

Rachel runs with Harry but looks confused --

RACHEL
Okay -- I didnt pay attention to anything
in seventh grade --
(worried)
-- is it going to explode

HARRY
-- worse --

AT THE BOTTOM - JOSHUAS POV - THE EXPOSED PLUTONIUM BUTTON

is dropping directly toward him --
HIGH ANGLE ON JOSHUA AND CAGE - THE PLUTONIUM BUTTON

finally reaches bottom -- as it lands it makes contact with the
other exposed button --

-- and in a silent but blinding FLASH OF LIGHT the exposed
plutonium goes critical -- the searing light fills the shaft --

ON TOP OF THE CONCRETE SPILLWAY - HARRY AND RACHEL

are running back from the opening -- and Harry shoves Rachel

down behind a rock shielding both of them as the light and
radiation from the critical reaction BLASTS out of the shaft

CLOSE ON HARRY AND RACHEL BEHIND THE ROCKS

They have landed together in a heap safely shielded -- Harry
lets out a sigh of relief as the light from the reaction fades

CUT TO

is in full bloom helicopters circle the area searching for
other terrorists and television crews have arrived - there are
reporters everywhere We find a NEST AGENT addressing a group of
TELEVISION REPORTERS shouting questions

NEST AGENT
-- the nuclear component of this incident
is as follows two plutonium bars were
exposed to each other but there was no
explosion -- repeat no explosion When
you put more than one segment of plutonium
into a confined space they go into a
critical reaction that releases an intense
but brief burst of radiation --

REPORTER (0S)
Whats the environmental impact

NEST AGENT
Manageable The burst irradiated only a
small replacable segment of the dam The
situation could have easily been much
worse -- even catastrophic --

Off to one side of the chaos we find
HARRY

waiting nervously as a NEST Emergency Medical Technician runs a
geiger counter over his body Finally --

EMT
Okay -- youre clean

Before Harry can even sigh in relief --

Thats a hell of a lot more than we can
say for this dam Disaster tends to follow
you around doesnt it Macneill

FORSTER
An arrogant FBI agent in his fifties shows up to take charge

FORSTER
Itll cost millions to replace that
spillway

HARRY
It wouldve cost a hell of a lot more to
replace the whole Tennessee River

Harry moves past Rachel who has heard this Harry sees --
AT THE TOP OF THE SPILLWAY CHUTE - EMERGENCY TECHNICIANS

hes tented in a plastic sheet We see hes suffered the effects
of a 1000 curie blast -- his skin is blistered his eyes see
nothing and hes weakened to the brink of death

As they raise him up Harry walks over The stretcher is lain
down on the concrete as the EMTs move away for a moment to get
a gurney Harry kneels down to speak through the tenting --

HARRY

you were smart enough to do that youd be
smart enough to know how to handle it Who
set this up

JOSHUA

-- an angel -- brought us the vials He

told us how -- to fulfill Gods destiny --

Amazing I count four lies already and he
isnt halfway done with the sentence yet --

As Everetts bullshit continues on screen and he calls Harry
forward for an awkward handshake --

-- in the doorway the real Harry walks in The techies applaud
and Harry bows with mock humility

KEITH
I have to resign I cant think of
anything worse than shaking hands with
that guy

HARRY

I can I have to ride the Metroliner with
him up to New York tonight so he can show
me off at a campaign dinner

But the good news is were funded for the
next three years So quit looking for
jobs and start looking for trouble

Well look he just got his brain
microwaved on the one thousand curie

of humor than you --

Harry slides a report across the desk at Keith

HARRY
I did plan the attack Right down to the
letter four years ago With Parrish

Keith starts flipping through the pages and pales --

HARRY
Target a facility with lousy security
Obtain the plutonium Find a nut group
that thinks the world is due to end and
would be happy to give it a nudge then
point them in the right direction The

scenarios from his tenure in the agency --

Starting where He got recruited into the
agency straight out of Stanford -- he

designed worst-cases for twenty years --
KEITH

Then I suggest that barring proof you

treat this as a coincidence

Harry takes a breath -- caims down --

KEITH
The whole purpose of this agency is to
come up with scenarios that might happen
You cant get too surprised when one does
We warn each target public or private
when we find a possible threat right

And almost every one of them responds by
saying Thatll never happen and your

solution is too expensive -- right So

if we start yelling about this now its

not going to make any difference -- right

starts to roll diagonally across the roof and off the side -- on
this curved smooth steel roof there is nothing to grip --

and it looks like theyll hit it at the same time -- but --
THE LAST FUEL TANKER IN THE FREIGHT JACKKNIFES

from the braking -- the tanker car derails and flips still
connected to the other cars --

INSIDE THE PASSENGER CAR ON METROLINER - VIEW ON FREIGHT TRAIN

-- the train derails in a whipsaw action from back to front
jumping the track -- the fuel in the last car ignites --

ON TOP OF THE METROLINER - HARRY HANGS ONTO THE BOX
-- which is empty -- the only thing inside was a note reading
ZERO SOLUTION

Harry hangs on as by the Metroliner the freight tanks derail
and explode up to the engine like a string of firecrackers --

AERIAL SHOT - THE TRAINS

-- the freight fully derails just short of the juncture the
momentum still shoving it through the dirt --

-- but the exploding fuel still blasts in a straight chain
reaction tank after tank up to the juncture --

ON METROLINER ROOF - THE TRAIN RACES THROUGH A SURGING FIREBALL

of exploding fuel from the tanks --

Harry braces against the box -- its his only shield against the
fire because the hydraulics tilt it into the flames as it
blasts through -- the ZERO SOLUTION note is incinerated --

INSIDE A PASSENGER CAR - FLAMES SCORCH THE WINDOWS

-- terrified the passengers shrink away --
ON TOP OF THE METROLINER - HARRY LOOKS BACK

The fireball is behind him Hes scorched scared but unhurt

HARRY (INTO PHONE)

The box was a decoy -- repeat decoy --
have you found anything in the other
Metroliner

IN THE SPARE METROLINER CAR - GLENN IS AT THE CONTROL CONSOLE
dissecting it and wiring it into a diagnostic computer --

GLENN (INTO PHONE)
All the controls have been rerouted inside
the hardware You cant touch anything --
the cabin lights might control the brakes
the side lights might control the speed
Its going to take a while to untangle

HARRY (FROM PHONE)
-- I havent got a while Glenn --

IN THE CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM - KEITH AND THE DISPATCHER
cut in holding a sheaf of technical documents --

KEITH
Harry weve got a new idea If you get to
the transformer on the lead car and cut
the power manually the trainll stop
dead Can you do it

ON THE METROLINER ROOF - HARRY

wonders exactly that The Metroliners transformer is ahead of
him atop the lead car -- but its a ten-by-twelve bed of
electricity fueled by the pantograph drawing power from the
lines above Getting into it without frying would be hard enough
standing still he has to do it at 110 miles an hour

AERIAL SHOT - HARRY CRAWLS ATOP THE TRAIN

as it tears across a Baltimore bridge over a river
IN THE LEAD CAR - RACHEL LOOKS AHEAD DOWN THE TRACKS

-- and suddenly ducks throwing herself below the windshield --

-- we see why -- a railroad maintenance car is ahead loaded
with three-foot replacement rails for the wire supports --

THE TRAIN SMASHES THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE CAR
hurling it up in a wad of twisted metal -- but worse --

-- the full load of three dozen metal rails fly up over the
train crashing down against the roof at wild angles --

ON THE TRAINS ROOF - HARRY

looks ahead wild-eyed because --

HARRYS POV - THE RAILS ARE RAINING DOWN

Its bad enough to just have twenty-five pound spikes showering
at this speed but they are electrified while in the wires --

-- they sweep toward Harry literally like lightning rods --
caught in the wires they could fry him and sweep him off --

OVERHEAD SHOT OF ROOF - HARRY ROLLS TO ONE SIDE

to avoid an electrified rail then instantly has to roll back
the other way to avoid another dragging against the train --

HARRYS POV - AN IMPENETRABLE TANGLE OF RAILS IS DEAD AHEAD

and coming up fast -- there are too many to avoid -
ON THE ROOF - HARRY

flattens out as much as he can -- and the sparking cracking
rails pass one half inch over him as the train sweeps under --

-- and an instant later hes past all of the rails

AERIAL SHOT - HARRY CROUCHES UP AND MOVES FORWARD

toward the lead car -- he reaches the gap between the cars and
jumps to the back of the lead car -- Harry lands roughly flat
on the back of the cars roof -- ashen he looks ahead --

HARRY (INTO PHONE)
Im at the transformer -- now what

KEITH (OVER PHONE)
You want the striped silver cable coming
off the pantograph -- cut through it but
make sure youre insulated Dont forget
theres a hell of a lot of electricity
running through this thing

HARRY (INTO PHONE)
Thanks Ill try to remember that

Harry looks at the transformer its rails leave no room to move
around the machinery The cable is infront -- he has to get
over the electrified machinery to cut it

HARRY CROUCHES ON THE METROLINER ROOF

and tentatively puts his foot on the rear rail -- one of the
only surfaces that isnt electrified -- finally --

-- Harry leaps ahead from the rail into the midst of the
machinery landing with one foot on a ceramic insulator --

-- without breaking momentum he leaps over the machinery and
under the pantograph to land onto the front of the engine car --

Harry lands on his side -- the windwash almost blows him back
inte the electrified machinery but he grabs the front rail --

-- steadying himself he pulls on a pair of insulated work
gloves and crouches in front of the striped cable Harry gets

out a heavy pair of wire cutters and poises them over the
Cable -- the blades start to pinch through -- but --

GLENN (0S ON PHONE)
Harry dont cut that cable --

Harrys hand freezes --
IN THE UNION STATION METROLINER CAR - GLENN
scans the diagnostic computer --
GLENN
The rewirings set so that if power is cut

Manually itll activate the brakes on the

ON TOP OF THE TRAIN - HARRY
hangs on desperate his mind racing --

HARRY (INTO PHONE)
Glenn what have you got on the brakes

GLENN (OVER PHONE)
Ive got about twenty ways to dim the
lights and sound the siren but no brakes
yet He could have hidden it anywhere --

Realization dawns on Harrys face -- he knows where it is --

HARRY
Have you tried turning the accelerator up

GLENN (0S ON PHONE)
(sharp)
Yeah -- it makes the train go faster Its
the only thing that does work right --
HARRY
Thats exactly why hed put the brakes
there Itd be his way of hiding it in
plain sight --

GLENN (0S ON PHONE)
Whose way

HARRY (OVER PHONE)
Just do it goddamn it - all the way up --

IN THE SPARE METROLINER CAR - GLENN

shoves the slider The speedometer races up -- 119 MPH -- 127
MPH -- when it hits 130 MPH the BRAKE INDICATOR lights up --

GLENN (INTO PHONE)
-- Thats it -- brakes kick in at 130 --

IN THE CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM - KEITH
motions to the dispatcher who radios the engineers --
KEITH (INTO PHONE)

youve got to get off the top now --
ON TOP OF THE TRAIN - HARRY

looks back -- theres not a chance he can get back over the
transformer machinery and to the door fast enough --

HARRY (INTO PHONE)
-- dont wait for me --

Harry takes the length of chain coiled around his vest and --
INSIDE THE SOUTHBOUND METROLINER - THE ENGINEER

cant believe what hes been told but he has no choice -- he
shoves the slider up and it goes to 121 MPH -- 125 MPH -- as

is rapidly tying off the chain onto the front roof rail --
IN THE NORTHBOUND METROLINER - RACHEL ACCELERATES THE TRAIN
The engine ROARS beyond full power -- 127 MPH -- 129 MPH --
ON TOP OF THE LEAD CAR - HARRY

fastens the chain around his chest and grips the chain with
gloved hands waiting terrified for the impact --

CLOSE ON THE HBOUND SPEEDOMETER
-- it digitally clicks to 130 MPH -- while --
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON THE NORTHBOUND SPEEDOMETER

as it ticks over to 130 MPH --

AERIAL SHOT - BOTH TRAINS BRAKES ACTIVATE

with a horrible SCREECHING of steel against wheels --
ON TOP OF THE NORTHBOUND - HARRY IS THROWN FORWARD BY THE SHOCK
-- he is suspended ahead of the train by the shock of impact

spinning and twisting on the end of the ten foot chain -- as --
INSIDE THE NORTHBOUND TRAIN - PASSENGERS
are thrown ahead against seats against walls -- this isnt a

crash but its the next best thing --
AERIAL SHOT OF BRIDGE - THE TRAINS STILL SPEED TOWARD EACH OTHER
The brakes kick in but its a long way down from 130 MPH --

ON TOP OF THE NORTHBOUND TRAIN - THE PANTOGRAPH IS KNOCKED LOOSE
by the impact -- it drops down like a hammer toward Harry --

-- Harry can only watch as the bar misses him and clatters away
onto the bridge -- and the pantograph smashes through the
railing the chain was tied to -- the chain whips away freed --

Harry feels the slack and lets go of the now-useless chain --
before the inertia throws him off he grabs the edge of the roof
and hangs on nothing supporting him but his fingertips --

INSIDE THE NORTHBOUND METROLINER - RACHEL LOOKS OUT THE FRONT

-- aside from the fast-approaching train she sees Harry
plastered across the front like a bug on a windshield --

Rachel climbs on top of the controls -- she sticks her arm
through a hole in the windshield to grab Harrys shoulder --

AERIAL SHOT OF BRIDGE - THE TRAINS

are braking and shaking in just as much danger of derailing and
dropping off the bridge as from the imminent collision --

ON THE FRONT OF THE TRAIN - HARRY HANGS ONTO THE ROOF

with one hand and reaches in the train with his other arm
holding Rachels arm just as shes gripping his --

Harry and Rachel face each other separated by the fractured
windshield -- the trains are almost upon one another -- the
steel SCREECH of the brakes is DEAFENING -- Harry turns --

HARRYS POV - THE FR F THE APPROACHING METROLINER

is one hundred feet away --

EXTREME CLOSEUP OF HARRYS FACE

Harry grimaces and shuts his eyes waiting for the impact --

but there a moment later just silence that is finally broken by
the loud CHUFF of brakes releasing --

-- Harry forces his eyes open --

ON THE BRIDGE - THE METROLINERS ARE EIGHTEEN INCHES APART

-- so close that Harry has trouble squeezing out between the two
windshields to lower himself shakily to the track

Harry leans against the girders and looks down at the river
exhausted taking a deep deep breath Rachel joins him and a
half-dozen news helicopters SWARM around the tracks as we --

Though exhausted Harry immediately heads for the stairs --

HARRY
Im fine Maggie -- this is Rachel Spence

Kaylie hasnt seen any of this has she
MAGGIE
No -- shes been in bed for hours now

Harry starts up the stairs and turns to Rachel --

HARRY

FOLLOWING SHOT UP THE STAIRS - HARRY RACES DOWN THE HALLWAY

to Kaylies room He opens the door finding Kaylie wadded up
at the foot of the bed and Drake perched comfortably on the
pillows Both look up sleepy-eyed at the intrusion

KAYLIE
Hi Daddy --

-- did you save anybody today

Harry grins and walks over to the bed --

HARRY
Yeah Im saving you from this miserable
thieving pillow-poaching hound --

Come on Drake This is where the dog goes

Harry pets the dog as it moves down -- and --

stares at a wall crowded with family photos Many show Harry and
Kaylie at her current age but only a few show Harry another

notices how he looks and smells wrinkling her nose

KAYLIE

Did they make you shovel coal on the train
HARRY

Nah -- they just ran out of room and made

me ride on top for a little while --
(kisses her)
Goodnight angel

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER - HARRY AND RACHEL

walk to her car parked in the driveway Rachel stops before
getting into her car Somethings on her mind

RACHEL
Can I ask you something Something
personal

Harrys taken off guard but he nods yes --

RACHEL
Did you ever think of working some place
not quite so dangerous

HARRY
Ordinarily the biggest danger at work is
carpal tunnel syndrome This has been kind
of a big week

RACHEL
All I meant was -- youve got a sweet
little girl in there

(serious)
Kaylie shouldnt lose both her parents

Harry considers a moment before answering

HARRY

Did you ever wish that you didnt know
something That you could just pull it out
of your head somehow

(tired)
I wish I didnt know lots of things I
wish I didnt know hundreds of ways to
kill thousands of people I wish I didnt
know that any of them could happen any
time and that weve got no protection
against most of them and that nobodys
doing a damn thing about it And I wish I
didnt know what its like to watch three
hundred people die because you couldn’t do
enough to save them

(beat)
Its Thomas Parrish Hes alive

FORSTER
You called the Bureau in for this
(explodes)
Jesus Christ -- I knew you were crazy but
this is the fucking limit --

HARRY

His autopsy checked out as suicide They
had bone and tissue samples from the
wreckage of the boat for a genetic match
But I checked the ME report The samples
were pieces you could remove from your own
body and live without --

(checks autopsy report)
-- multiple strips of skin several
molars a pint of blood --

FORSTER
(disbelieving)
So let me get this right -- he tore this
stuff off his body and planted it in the
boat so the ID would be positive

HARRY
He knew enough about autopsies to satisfy
a coroner and enough about accident
investigation to put them where theyd be
found I saw the explosion I heard him on
the phone His life was destroyed
(beat)
Who was going to question the autopsy

FORSTER
Thats a hell of a lot of trouble for
someone who had nothing to live for

HARRY
He had something to live for This The
dam the trains -- those were both

scenarios wed worked out and he played

them out to the letter And believe me

hes got a million where they came from
(beat)

Whats worse is he knows the planned

solutions to the scenarios He can improve

them and use decoys

GLENN
Its even worse than that Parrish
designed our computer database to have a
back door into every federal computer
system The potential for cyberwarfare is
tremendous

Forster is rolling his eyes but Rachel is more interested --

FORSTER
You havent got any proof --

HARRY
I saw him yesterday from the train --

FORSTER
Uh-huh Did anybody else

HARRY
He left a note on the train He sent me
computer downloads including a picture of
his wife right before she died

FORSTER
So where are they
Harry is stuck -- he knows how lame this sounds --
HARRY

The note went up in smoke on the train
The downloads vanished when I tried saving
them

FORSTER
Sure Ive got to run Batman You let me
know if the Riddler sends you a new puzzle
Before Forster can take Rachel out of the room -- Keith bursts
in out of breath in a biking outfit clutching a helmet
KEITH
Sorry Im late The roads are really
jammed up -- for some reason no one wants

to take the trains today

(catches his breath)
Ive just been to Union Station You know
what it took to cause about ten million
dollars in damage yesterday

Keith pulls out an envelope and shakes it out onto the table --
eight computer chips plink and bounce around

KEITH
About twenty bucks in computer chips
Three of them went into the Metroliner
control cars The rest went into dispatch
computers

RACHEL
How could anybody physically break into
all those systems to install the chips

KEITH
Thats the beautiful part Nobody had to
break into anything
(beat)
The chips were installed six weeks ago by
the in-house maintenance guys as a part of
a routine upgrade

chugs out on an elevated track past a dingy three-story
warehouse on a corner by the station Its worn and torn but
oddly the top story is lined with reflective windows --
INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WINDOWS

The one-way glass floor to ceiling on each wall provides an
unobstructed high view of all streets leading toward it

This loft which is a single enormous room is a workshop

Some tables are full of electronic gear others have chemical
mixes and on still others are two dozen running computers all
hooked into phone lines all hooked to a master station

Near that is a pile of federal Ids that run through a magnetic
striper hooked up to the computers to program codes into them
They all look perfect We finally find --

PARRISH

His face is in a metal device wired into the computers He keeps
one eye open as a laser scanner sweeps across it A nearby
screen shows RETINAL IDENTIFICATION SCAN RECORDED

When a computer BEEPS Parrish gets up to look at it As he
passes other computers we see each is tied to a different
federal agency big ones like the Navy Air Force CIA and
smaller ones like ATF CDC Department of Energy Parrish stops
at the one BEEPING its tied into the FBI network

looks up from the screen as unconcerned as if he were ordering
the strike himself -- out one of the windows he can see that
a helicopter is indeed on the way as well as a caravan of
federal sedans speeding from each road toward him

but its oxygen pushed by a maintenance worker -- as Harrys POV
follows the worker the cart wheels past --

-- Parrish -- slightly disguised but unmistakably Parrish --
HARRY RUNS TO THE NEAREST ESCALATOR

-- he shoves down the up escalator past the crowds --

AHEAD IN THE LOUNGE - PARRISH

hears the sounds of pissed off people as Harry shoves through
With no more level of concern than a passenger late for a
flight he walks faster and draws a card from his pocket --
HARRY HITS THE BOTTOM OF THE ESCALATOR

and runs through the dense crowd swerving through passengers
Harry gets his phone and as a result --

-- he almost collides with the boy with the videogame who is
playing as he walks -- while --

AHEAD IN THE LOUNGE - PARRISH MOVES TO AN EMPLOYEE ONLY DOOR

that is controlled by a magnetic smart card and keypad Parrish
swipes the card through and enters a code -- the door unlocks --
and Parrish breezes through it --

HARRY SHOVES THROUGH THE CROWD

to get to the employee door before it shuts -- but he reaches it
a second too late - the metal door clicks and locks shut

Harry panting bangs against the door An annoyed TICKET AGENT
comes over and Harry takes out his ID --

HARRY
Open this door Right now

The startled ticket agent fumbles for her card and swipes it
through but it wont work -- the computers been frozen As
Harry figures his next move the cell phone rings --

PARRISH (ON PHONE)
I see you got my note

IN A STAIRWELL - FOLLOWING PARRISH

-- he walks down the stairs at a fast yet casual clip No one
is coming after him and he knows no one will stop him

HARRY (ON PHONE)
Tom -- why are you doing this

PARRISH (INTO PHONE)
Youre an intelligent man Harry You
squander your mind crafting nightmares for
nameless faceless people Cant you tell
when a nightmare is being crafted for you

Parrish exits through the bottom door and outside -- as --
UP IN THE AIRPORT - BY THE WINDOWS - HARRY

moves parallel to Parrish but he has no way out to get to
Parrish as he crosses the tarmac Parrish looks up at Harry --

PARRISH (ON PHONE)
Are you sure you want to follow me Youre
going to miss the trigger
HARRY (INTO PHONE)
(angry now)
For a bomb I thought you were a little
more original than that --

ON THE TARMAC - PARRISH

heads toward a passenger tram service As he walks Parrish
keeps eye contact with Harry through the window --

PARRISH (INTO PHONE)
Im not But since you have an endlessly
genocidal imagination I used one of yours
(modestly)
I added a couple of flourishes but you
are the sole architect of the catastrophe
that is about to happen

IN THE AIRPORT - HARRY STOPS COLD
-- he looks out at Parrish and at the airfield thinking --

PARRISH (ON PHONE)

You havent guessed yet It was one of
your favorites You didnt think it was as
funny as say your idea about nerve gas
in the balloon drop at a political
convention but still you were laughing
for days

(disappointed)
Come on Harry Think fast

Harry stops sickened as realization crosses his face

HARRY (INTO PHONE)
Jesus -- mo -- you cant have --

PARRISH (ON PHONE)
Its definitely one of your best I
couldnt have done it without you

Harry stops looking outside looking inside reeling --

PARRISH (ON PHONE)
Its an exhilarating feeling isnt it To
have one of your scenarios fully play out
Its like being an author on opening night

HARRY
Tell me where it is --
(desperate)
If this is about me come after me
goddamn it not innocent people --

ON THE TARMAC - THROUGH A GATE - PARRISH

waves to a worker as he moves from the fenced area and gate
toward a bench full of passengers waiting for a shuttle

PARRISH
Hmm So you dont count yourself among the
innocent

PARRISH

That is remarkable progress and candor
coming from you

(beat)
But no that annoying tone of moral
certitude thinking that bystanders are
innocent by definition --

(beat)
Im afraid you still have a lot to learn

Parrish steps up the pace -- a shuttle bus is coming He looks

up and sees that Harry is no longer at the window

PARRISH (INTO PHONE)
I see youve decided not to follow me --

INSIDE NATIONAL AIRPORT LOBBY - HARRY RUNS THROUGH
the airport frantic looking everywhere at once --
PARRISH (ON PHONE)
Lets see if you can apply half as much
ingenuity toward stopping this scenario as
you used in creating it
The phone abruptly CLICKS OFF -- and Harry starts dialing --

RACHEL

anywhere -- as he urgently talks on the phone --
HARRY

The trigger is a kid with a videogame

RACHEL (OVER PHONE)
The trigger For a bomb

HARRY

Worse Its a high energy radio gun
planted outside With a bomb you only get
one plane With this thing you blast
every plane in the glide path out of the
sky -- it1l cook their electronics

Get outside with whoever runs the
airfield Start with recent maintenance
Look for a dish or an antenna that
doesnt belong --

RACHEL (OS ON PHONE)
On an airfield Its nothing but
antennas --

HARRY
Just do it --
As Harry runs through the lounge --
ELSEWHERE IN THE AIRPORT - IN A PLUSH LOUNGE CHAIR - THE BOY
furiously plays the game twisting in videogame body english --
THE GAME SCREEN - THE AIRPLANE
is moving more skillfully through the cartoon canyon --
IN THE TERMINAL - HARRY
is drawing stares He looks like a nut from the way hes running

and sweating and he looks even crazier when the faint SOUND of
tinny electronic music makes him stop and stare at --

-- a family waiting at a gate including a ten year old BOY
playing with a Gameboy

Harry runs over like a man possessed -- the people in the lounge
look frightened by his weird behavior Harry snatches the game
away -- without acknowledging the kids startled YELL Harry
smashes it against a railing once twice --

-- and the game splits in half Harry looks at the electronics
inside -- with one glance he knows this isnt the one Without
explaining he runs off looking left and right --

IN THE PLUSH LOUNGE CHATR - THE BOY

is still playing like his life depended on it --

On screen hes almost made it but the wing hits a wall and
the plane CRASHES starting the too bad MUSIC --

-- the boy starts it over immediately excited because he knows
hes almost got it worked out -- while --

IN THE NATIONAL TERMINAL - HARRY SNATCHES ANOTHER GAME

from a different kid and SMASHES it open Harry looks at it --
its not the one He flings it aside and runs on not hearing
the outraged SHOUTS of people behind him

Harry pauses desperate his eyes darting everywhere for a clue
Something catches his eye across the terminal --

-- the swinging door of a first class lounge -- hidden from the
rest of the airport yet the closest part to the exterior

Harry knows this is his best shot -- he runs to the door as
nearby an angry PARENT points two airport cops toward Harry

OUTSIDE THE AIRPORT - AT A RADAR UNIT - RACHEL

examines it with the security chief who is unconvinced --
CHIEF
I oversaw the installation of the new
radar network myself Theres no way
anyone could raise a transmitter here
without my knowing

But as he says this Rachel is distracted by the blinding runway
lights that SEAR on -- she covers her eyes --

CLOSE ON ONE OF THE VISI LANDING BEACONS

-- which is the perfect size for a transmitter When triggered
by the tower it shines a light directly up at the planes --

ON RACHELS FACE AS SHE REALIZES WHERE IT IS
-- she grabs the radio and SHOUTS urgently into it --
RACHEL

The transmitter is in the landing
beacon -- you have to cut it off now --

Meanwhile --
IN THE FIRST CLASS LOUNGE ENTRANCE - HARRY
runs in and shoves past the RECEPTIONIST --

RECEPTIONIST
Sir -- I need to see a ticket sir --
Harry stops -- all he can see are the usual collection of

business passengers and the backs of plush lounge chairs --

THE BOY IS HIDDEN FROM HARRYS VIEW

-- behind the chair back facing the window He is in the zone
playing the game with a frantic expression on his face --

THE GAME SCREEN - THE PLANE
is almost out of the canyon --
ON HARRY

Harry looks around and finally sees the reflection of the boy
in the window -- he can clearly see hes playing a game --

-- Harry sprints across the lounge toward the boy pushing aside
chairs shoving aside a waitress -- each second is an
eternity -- Harry is three feet from the boy when --

-- the two airport cops grab Harry from behind --

COP
Okay asshole thats enough --
Harry struggles wild-eyed -- it only makes him look crazier --
HARRY

Its the game Youve got to stop it --
But the boy is totally oblivious his body whipping around --
THE GAME SCREEN - THE PLANE CLEARS THE CANYON

-- the word CONGRATULATIONS is followed by victory music --
CLOSE ON HARRYS FACE

-- he knows one more crisis has slipped through his fingers --
CLOSE ON THE GAME UNIT

-- there is an electronic microburst transmission --

OUTSIDE THE AIRPORT - ON A VACANT R AY

The signal activates a landing light -- a high energy high
frequency blast fires up out of it --

ELSEWHERE ON THE GROUND - THE RADAR TOWER

sparks and short circuits completely frying --

Rachel horrified looks around all of the ground electronics
are short circuiting and dying -- our VIEW shifts UP to show --

A727JETLINER IS LANDING

-- its several hundred feet up and on approach -- nearby --
ASMALLER GULFSTREAM PRIVATE JET IS TAKING OFF
like a sleek rocket angling up from an opposite runway -- but

INSIDE THE GULFSTREAM COCKPIT - THE CONTROL PANEL SPARKS OUT
and c 1 1 i -- the PILOTS have no time to react --
INSIDE THE JETLINER CABIN - THE LIGHTS

and all electricity die out -- PASSENGERS SCREAM as all you can
see in the dark is the ground rushing up at an odd angle --

WIDE VIEW ON BOTH JETS - ALL LIGHTS FAIL

- and you can also hear their engines WHINE to a halt --

CLOSE ON RACHELS FACE WATCHING THE JETS

-- unable to believe what shes seeing --

CLOSE ON HARRYS FACE

-- he can only watch helplessly out the window as --
WIDE VIEW ON THE JETS - BOTH ARE POWERLESS

and out of control -- the 727 that was landing now dips
dangerously to one side three hundred feet above the ground --

-- the Gulfstream has stopped its ascent four hundred feet
up -- it plummets directly toward the front of the 727 --

INSIDE THE GULFSTREAM COCKPIT - THE PILOTS

look out helplessly at the faces of the 727 pilots dead
ahead -- the arc of their fall takes them past the cockpit --

THE GULFSTREAM SMASHES INTO THE WING OF THE 727

-- the Gulfstream ricochets off the wing and its own wing is
torn off -- it spirals toward the airport as --

-- the 727 is skewed sideways by the impact -- with no engines
to direct it it begins to corkscrew down to the ground --

-- the 727 IMPACTS ON THE RUNWAY at a sickening steep angle --
the first thing to hit is the weakened wing which shears off --

-- the planes fuselage hits hard -- the landing gear collapses
and the fuselages bottom scrapes the runway at eighty miles an
hour sparking and igniting fuel in its wake - as it skids --

-- the fuselage tears in half expelling a section of passengers
still in their seats -- both halves skid in seperate directions
across the airport field --

-- until finally the fuselages halves seperately skid to a
halt at the end of the runway But at the same time --

THE PLUMMETING GULFSTREAM IS HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARD THE AIRPORT
and it looks like itll hit the crowded observation area but it
falls just short of that -- it erashes in a FIREBALL against the
concrete one hundred yards from the building --

ON THE RUNWAY - RACHEL AND THE SECURITY CHIEF

are knocked down by the blast of heat and air -- as --
INSIDE THE NATIONAL TERMINAL - AT THE WINDOWS - THE SHOCKWAVE

blasts the windows forty feet high and hundreds of feet long
into the lounge area showering the crowd inside with glass --

CuT To
EXT OUTSIDE AIRPORT - AT RUNWAY - RACHEL STARES AT THE WRECKAGE
strewn across hundreds of feet of runway There are tangled
shards of metal and luggage burning into the asphalt The first
of the fire crews and EMTs rush in to remove the dead and rescue
the survivors

Harry runs up to Rachel who is more emotionally shocked than
physically hurt Shes never seen a disaster like this before

82
RACHEL

I should have stopped it
(shaken)
All these people --
HARRY

Theres nothing else you could have done
Sometimes you do everything right and
its still not going to make a difference

RACHEL
If Id gotten to that beacon --

HARRY
-- then youd be part of that fireball
too You might as well blame that kid with
the videogame as blame yourself

FORSTER (0S)
You should pay attention to this guy

Rachel and Harry see Forster flanked by other FBI agents
FORSTER
Hes had lots of practice at shifting
blame away from himself
HARRY
(angry)
Not as much as youve had at showing up
ten minutes too late If youd pulled your
head out of your ass and listened to me --
Harry trails off in mid-speech because his eye is caught by --

a work crew pulling at some tangled wreckage -- one of the
identifiable things taken out is a scorched childs toy

Harrys face shifts from anger to horror to fear Hes thought
of something worse than the carnage in front of him

Without another word Harry runs away as fast as he can Rachel
and Forster watch both concerned both for different reasons

CUT TO

EXT OUTSIDE HARRYS HOUSE - IN THE DRIVEWAY - HARRY AND KAYLIE

are locked in an intense goodbye hug -- Maggie stands by at a
car Harry finally lets Kaylie go and she looks up miserably

KAYLIE
Why arent you coming with us

HARRY

Strategy honey

(trying to cheer her up)
You can play Battleship with Maggie Let
her win sometimes -- just dont let her
whistle Rule Brittania when she does

(she smiles slightly)
Ill see you soon angel I promise
Kaylie kisses Harry and as she walks to the car Harry turns to
Maggie to speak in low intense tones

HARRY

This is important Maggie Every one of
these things is important

(she nods)
Dont use credit cards or ATMs This
should be enough cash for a while

(hands her envelope)
Dont call anyone I know Dont call
anyone you know Dont call anyone at all

(hands her note)
This lodge in Virginia is out of the way
and off the road When you get there stay
out of sight Garage the car Keep Kaylie
inside Dont let her listen to the radio

As they speak headlights illuminate them -- another car pulls
up Harry takes a zippered packet he was about to give Margaret
and he unzips it -- inside is a revolver --

-- but as the car stops he sees its Rachel As Rachel gets out
and sees whats going on she understands why Harry left

Harry turns back to Margaret -- he zips the packet back up

HARRY

This part is crucial If you see Parrish
do not hesitate to shoot him in the face --

(she blanches)
-- in the face because if he shows up
hes got something a hell of a lot worse
in mind for Kaylie

(beat)
Can you do that Maggie

Margaret nods frightened as Harry puts the gun in the bag She
starts the engine as Rachel reaches Harry

RACHEL
You think hed go after her

Harry waves to Kaylie as the car drives off into the night

HARRY
Shes all Ive got left of my wife
(beat)
Shes all Ive got period Ive thought
of a lot of horrible things but none
worse than something happening to her

(beat)
Thats why he has to go after her
Otherwise it wouldnt be -- complete

Rachel puts a hand on his shoulder --

RACHEL
Then lets find him first Theyve started
forensics on the planes --

already done but its not taking us any

at a security console as the words type onto the screen --

Parrish is escorted to an elevator by a man in his 70s -- DOCTOR
NAGLE who seems irritated as he looks at his watch

NAGLE
At this hour this had better be
important Mister --

PARRISH
Gant Richard Gant

Both swipe magnetic cards through a reader to gain access --
AT THE GUARD CONSOLE - ON A COMPUTER SCREEN - PARRISHS ID

checks perfectly The retrieved information indicates he is

photo thumbprint and a whole written history

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR - NAGLE AND PARRISH RIDE UP

PARRISH
In Russia in three hours I have a team
of men who are going to raid a Chechen
storehouse thats full of treaty-banned
weapons bought on the black market

PARRISH
(hands over paper)
Our source indicates that this is inside

Nagle eyes it with concern -- then with actual shock

PARRISH
Before my men go in Doctor I need all
the intel I can get on this thing How it
might be used if it can be contained --
(serious)
The safety of our country depends on it

INT VACCINE DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY - A MOMENT LATER - PARRISH

and Nagle are in a lab -- and both men are now inbiohazard
protective suits The lab has another element to it - one of

several walk-in vaults that have more computer locks
Nagle punches in a keypad and swipes a smart card through the
Magnetic reader Parrish does the same -- but well note as
Parrish swipes his through it does more than identify him --
BACK AT THE GUARD CONSOLE - THE GUARD READS A MAGAZINE

and doesnt see that a monitor VAULT ONE freezes its image It
doesnt show that Parrish and Nagle have entered

INSTDE THE VAULT - NAGLE

withdraws a rack of three test tubes from an incubator --
NAGLE

This is Hemolyticus necrosii We made it
from a form of streptococcus --

PARRISH
The flesh eating bug I heard

Nagle takes out a petri dish of a dark brown substance He takes
a wire tool and very carefully dips into the tubes --

NAGLE

This form is far far worse

(withdraws wire)
It can enter a human through inhalation
or even skin contact It can spread in the
air it can survive in temperatures from
ten degrees to thirty-nine centigrade the
kill rate is one hundred percent and no
antibiotic we can develop works against it

(sort of admiring it)
It is absolutely unstoppable

Parrish watches as Nagle takes the wire tip and lightly traces
a spiral pattern through the petri dish

NAGLE
This is animal plasma Now watch --

As the wire traces through the bacteria visibly breaks down the
blood following the greenish spiral pattern The green pattern
spreads -- in no time it will destroy the entire sample

NAGLE

Its irreparably breaking down hemoglobin
at an unprecedented rate In a human it
would spread through the capillary system
until all tissue is desiccated

(beat)
Your men must exercise extreme caution No
wild shooting around this because there
is no cure there is no treatment there
is no containment if it gets loose

(picks up tubes)
Theres enough of a threshold dose in
these vials to wipe out millions

Parrish takes the tube rack out of Nagles hand and hefts it
as if he can feel the millions of lives inside Nagle looks
surprised as Parrishs face changes The game is over

PARRISH
You understand that Ill be taking this

Nagle takes the rack from Parrish and puts it on the counter

face who
Like hell I dont care who you are --
this sample stays here woe maintained
for research only not for offensive --

With sudden ferocity Parrish shoves Nagle across the vault
Nagle tumbles down and Parrish walks to him slowly --

PARRISH
You know you remind me of someone --

Parrish topples an incubator onto Nagle with a loud CRASH --
BACK AT THE GUARD STATION - THE GUARD SEES NOTHING

The VAULT monitor is frozen on the image of an empty room --

INSIDE THE VAULT - CLOSE ON NAGLE
Nagle is pinned under the incubator in pain unable to get up

oer even to move his arms He looks terrified as Parrish tears
Nagles hood out of his suit with controlled anger --

PARRISH
Hes in government service too Hes as
deluded as you are He spends his days
like you do thinking of new innovative
ways to kill millions of people --

Parrishs hooded face is almost up against Nagles unprotected
head Nagle struggles but is in pain and cant move --

PARRISH
-- and hes convinced himself that hes
protecting them He pretends to be a
savior Just like you
(intense)
But deep down he knows what he really
is Just like you

Parrish sticks the wire tool inside the bacteria tube --

PARRISH
Dont you know what you are Nagle

Nagle shrinks back but its no use -- Parrish lightly traces
the wir re Nagles forehead -- and we CUT TO

walks out of the elevator back in his suit incredibly calm He
breezes past the guard station and is almost gone when --

Parrish signs out and leaves The guard finally notices that
the Vault One image is stuck -- he gets up to check it out
IN THE VACCINE RESEARCH LABORATORY - A MOMENT LATER - THE GUARD

checks it out Nothing seems out of the ordinary He heads to
the vault and looks through a porthole --

THROUGH THE PORTHOLE - THE GUARDS FACE

registers revulsion and absolute horror --

NAGLES AGONIZED LLAPSING FACE IS RAVAGED BY THE BACTERIA
which has spread into his open dissolving eyes -- he is still
alive screaming soundlessly -- as the bacteria breaks down the
hemoglobin it has etched a green trail in its wake --

forehead burned into it by the disease --

at the sprinklers on the ceiling -- theyre perfectly positioned
to be receivers scanning every monitor in the room

Its amazing that we never guessed After
all it is the final logical conclusion
of what we do Theres never been an
advanced weapon in history thats been
developed and not used That is what our
ideas are Weapons

(beat)
Seems the CIA had been digging into our
database for years to map out black ops
against other countries As you see they
werent that discriminating in their
methodology It didnt particularly matter
to them if they murdered five hundred
people just to get one arms dealer

(beat)
I didnt find out myself until the

to talk too much about what we did to the

Hill

He said I should rise above my
principles

Harry is sickened and stunned into silence looking at all the
photos of disasters surrounding him

PARRISH (ON PHONE)

All that time we thought we were saving
lives by thinking the unthinkable and it
turns out we were just idea men for
assassins

How does it make you feel to be surrounded
by all that death you helped cause Harry
Do you feel powerful or --

killed yourself on that boat --

on the roof of the gas plant I arrived at
the inescapable conclusion that my life
means nothing Absolutely nothing

But after considering it for a while I
decided my death would be a wasted gesture
if I couldnt take a few of the people
responsible with me

IN SIMULATION ROOM HARRY
paces around the room furious --

HARRY
Yeah Who was responsible on those planes

PARRISH (ON PHONE)

(sighs as if to a child)
Responsibility is a distinctly fugitive
concept Harry The harder you look for
it the faster it runs away

someone reads about death squads in
Salvador or assassinations in Chile or
bombings in Nicaragua or some of the

Macneill who has been on-site for several
disasters and near-disasters has been
arrested on suspicion of causing them --

ON SCREEN Harry is shoved into an FBI van as the VIEW CUTS TO
an FBI briefing office Forster is caught in mid-sentence --

I didnt believe it at first But the

HARRY

We built experimental versions just to
prove it could be done with store bought
equipment Parrish must have kept parts
from one --

RACHEL
Thats pretty thin Macneill I know you
were angry but you should have gotten
help --

HARRY
Shut up and listen -- hes still out
there and hes not done Hes running a

RACHEL
That was yesterdays bullshit --

HARRY
Its not an explosive its a military

Washington that destroys the entire city

and taps on the computer which has a wireless modem hooked up
to a satellite phone On the screen we see icons set up to run
programs -- he hits one that looks like a telephone --

HARRY (VO)
If he planted a logic bomb or virus in the

utilities -- phones gas power -- all he
needs is a phone call to activate it

As we hear Harry Parrish moves the onscreen mouse to another
icon -- a lightning bolt obviously meaning power --

die out -- the only lights visible now are from the travelling

I dont get it
HARRY

To him Boyne Lake meant a zero solution
He had to sacrifice his wife for the lives
of thousands of people
HARRY

(beat)
Hes got a UAV You know what that is

(she doesnt)
It stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and
hes got the best one ever built It can
beat radar its got missile
countermeasures and it sure as hell can
spray that bacteria all over the city

(beat)
There is absolutely no containment for the
bacteria if it gets out It could wipe out
the whole continent So theres only one
solution for this scenario One choice

RACHEL
(realizing shaken)
Sacrifice of Washington

HARRY
At least one nuclear bomb Depending on
the release there might be two or three
in a chain to make sure the bacteria
cant spread in a high wind pattern

in one corner showing copter footage of the FBI van moving --

Harry -- you cant leave town yet --
On a low segment of the monitor Parrish compares the TV footage
to a utilities map of gas mains -- he manipulates pressure
controls for a specific gas main on the map and --

and holiday traffic is ahead -- but suddenly a gas explosion
tears through the highway two hundred yards away --

-- the gigantic blast tears a sixty foot gap across both
directions of the highway -- cars caught in the blast burn and

explode -- others unable to stop fall into the blazing gap --

The van driver stands on the brakes but --

by one car that is unable to stop -- it flips onto its side and
skids uncontrollably toward the gap --

ANGLE ON THE VAN

-- the driver limp and bloodied is clearly dead -- the van
sparking against the asphalt skids toward the flaming gap --

-- it stops ten yards from the gap -- but its clear from the
CRACKING and RUMBLING that the section wont stand long --

INSIDE THE CARGO AREA - HARRY AND RACHEL

help each other up dazed Rachel unlocks Harrys chains and
they move to the door but it wont open --

OUTSIDE THE VAN - THE DOOR IS PADLOCKED
and the bolts holding the lock on are loosened but intact --

-- the road however isnt -- cracks spiderweb beneath it --

INSIDE THE VAN - HARRY AND RACHEL

hear the CRACKING -- they SLAM against the door until the
damaged lock finally gives and they tumble onto the road --

Harry and Rachel stumble out running across segments of road
that crumble as fast as they leave them behind --

-- until a moment later the road completely collapses under the
van and it falls into the flames

At a stable section Harry and Rachel lean on a rail to catch
their breath As news copters SWARM above Harry looks back --

Washington DC is completely immobilized Electricity is out
everywhere -- the only light comes from the fires of blown
highway segments and the lights of thousands of trapped cars

HARRY
We have to find Parrish -- if hes done
this hes ready to release the bacteria

Harry turns toward Rachel and sees shes holding a gun on him

RACHEL
Were not going anywhere I still cant be
sure that --
(tense shaky)
-- that youre not making all this happen

HARRY
(intense)
You cant Be sure I wish to Christ Id
blown my own brains out five years ago
before I thought of it but youre right
I planned this every step of the way
(agitated)
Tf it happens hundreds of thousands of
people will die and I am responsible

If it happens my daughter is in Virginia
and shell die too and Im responsible

Theres not a goddamn thing I can do to
take back the fact that I thought of this

EXT RURAL VIRGINIA - ON A HILLSIDE - THE BARN

that Parrish was working in earlier lights up -- we hear engines
and computers whirring to life --
INSIDE THE BARN - THE HUNTER UAV

is just as advanced and frightening as advertised its about
ten feet across made from a black non-reflective alloy and
shaped like a sting-ray to beat radar

On top of the ship are its electronics -- underneath it is an
aerosol full of the bacteria and a pair of booster rockets --
-- the rockets fire blasting the UAV out of the barn and

away -- the rotten wood of the barn goes up in flames -- as
THE HUNTER UAV CLIMBS UP

and levels off at two hundred feet -- its spent booster rockets

detach tumbling to the trees below

As the rockets fall away nothing illuminates the UAV -- it is
virtually invisible The ships silent jets propel it toward
Washington now as quiet and unobtrusive as a black kite

INT HELICOPTER - RACHEL IS FLYING

away from the shut-down highway leaving behind a pissed-off
NEWS PILOT Harry seated next to her works on his palmtop --

RACHEL
Whatre you doing

HARRY
Parrishs knocked out the regular phones
and the cell phones but he has to be
using a line himself The only ones left
are direct satellite phones

Harry looks at the palmtop screen -- it reads DOWNLOADING
ACTIVE SATPHONE PATTERN - ZONE 2814 But as the graphic loads
with a map of the capital mall area hundreds of dots light up
to indicate satphone activity

Off Harrys frustrated look we CUT TO --
THE HAY-ADAMS SUITE - PARRISH

looks at his laptop screen which is now segmented into monitors
for the UAV One segment shows a gun camera view out the
front and another shows the targeting system after POSITION
we see a constantly-changing GPS number -- and after TARGET we
see one unchanging GPS number At the same time --

THE UAV FLIES OVER THE FRINGES OF WASHINGTON

matching the GPS path Parrish programmed in As it flies over
the city we see theres a POSITION and TARGET readout by the
aerosol -- when the numbers match the sprayer will go off

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - HARRY

tries something else as the copter flies over the darkened
city dimly illuminated by flashlights and small fires

On the palmtop screen Harry switches from the graphic to an
“ACTIVE SATPHONE USER LOG -- he scrolls through the list of
hundreds of names Rachel looks over at this incredulous --

RACHEL
You think hes listed

Harry scans down the names quickly then stops at an entry for
KAFFA GROUP INC As he switches it to a graphic --

HARRY

Very cute Tom -- the phones registered
to the Kaffa Group

(off Rachels puzzled look)
Its obvious The first known use of
biowarfare In the fourteenth century
when the Tartars catapulted plague- ridden
bodies into the city of Kaffa

RACHEL
(blank)
Sure Everybody knows that Did it work

HARRY
The Tartars won the city But half of
Europe was wiped out by the worst plague
of all time

Harry grimly looks down -- they are over the Constitutional
Mall and it is swarming with thousands of people

HARRY
This has to be his target Theres no
protection -- every one of these people

would get dosed if he sprayed it here

HARRY
No -- youll break the tank if you do --

The good news is you can still kill
yourself if you feel like it The bad news
1s youre going all by yourself

Congratulations Harry That was nicely
done But you cant think I wouldnt go
into this without secondary and tertiary
backups

Then again -- you can think a lot of
thinks if you try

listens to Parrish ashen --
PARRISH (ON PHONE)

It was your idea Harry Children make
excellent delivery vectors

Ive wondered for three years if you would
have moved faster for the sake of someone
you cared about Or if youd be capable of
the same sacrifice I had to make

crosses to the case that contained the bacteria vials The
impressions show two are missing but one is still there
Parrish snaps it shut and starts out of the room as --

IN THE HELICOPTER - HARRY AND RACHEL

Harry pounds on the palmtop in frustration

RACHEL
What is it

HARRY
Dr Seuss The Thinks You Can Think
Its Kaylies favorite book Goddamn it --

RACHEL
Cant you just send her another e-mail and
tell her to ignore it

HARRY
It wont go through -- he must have
blocked the line

RACHEL
Then we have to go out there

Rachel banks the copter away out of the city -- and --
CLOSE ON HARRYS FACE
as he desperately thinks it through trying to find any other

alternative any other way -- hes shaken to his core because
theres only one thing to do only one decision to make

HARRY
No We cant Go to the hotel

RACHEL
(staggered)
Were talking about your daughter --
HARRY
(angry)

Dont you think I know that Dont you
think he knows that Fly to the hotel -

Rachel turns the helicopter back to head toward the Hay-Adams
above the chaos in the streets as Harry struggles with his
decision -- its killing him but theres no other choice

HARRY
He said he had two backups Hes banking
on my going to Virginia so he can
implement the other one

HARRY

(beat)
Hes going to release some of the bacteria
himself using the hotel as a launching
point If he gets any of it out any at
all he wins Washington 68 gone --

(shaky)
-- and Kaylies dead either way

RACHEL
If we get there first -- do you know how
to stop him
Harrys face darkens -- its not a very pleasant solution
HARRY

Yes
IN THE HOTEL STAIRCASE - PARRISH CLUTCHES THE CASE
and quickly trots up the stairs toward the roof -- while --
OUTSIDE THE HAY-ADAMS HOTEL - AT STREET LEVEL - THE CROWD
stampedes in a panic - our VIEW PANS UP to the rooftop --

-- the copter arrives as at the other end of the roof an
access door opens -- and Parrish emerges with the case

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - HARRY

pockets something as the copter lowers to the roof --

HARRY
Give me one minute -- if I cant get it
away from him do what I told you
RACHEL
I cant --
HARRY
(sharp)
You have to
Harry stares down Rachel -- hes asking her to kill him And
after a long moment her look shows that she agrees
HARRY
(resigned)
When its over -- get to Kaylie as fast as
you can
As the copter dips to the roof Harry opens the door -- and --

AT ROOF LEVEL - HARRY JUMPS FROM THE COPTER

and runs across to intercept Parrish before he can reach the

front -- Parrish sees him coming and unlatches the case --
Harry slams into Parrish hard -- they go down in a tangle but
the open case is knocked away -- it clatters across the roof

stopping precariously at the front edge

They struggle but Parrish gets the better of Harry whos
weakened -- Parrish kicks Harry down --

PARRISH
Im surprised to see you Harry -- anda
little flattered
(breathing hard)
I never would have guessed that you hate
me more than you love your daughter

Leaving Harry behind Parrish lopes back toward --
THE CASE

which stands open over the edge -- the vial shakes loose and
falls out onto the roof --

Parrish moves up to grab the case -- but as he gets there --

Harry moves into view and tackles him -- Parrish swings the
empty case back at Harry hing him in the f with it --
Harry staggers back at the roofs edge as --

THE GLASS VI ROLLS LOO F E

The roofs edge is stylishly rounded and the vials bulbous
shape has it wavering back and forth toward either the hundred
foot drop to the crowd or back to the roof --

- until finally it rolls off the edge and off the roof --

PARRISH SEES THIS
and tosses away the case -- he looks over the edge to see --

PARRISHS POV - THE VIAL HAS LANDED

on a small ornate part of a window sill -- it is cracked but
it is still sealed and intact dangling above the street and the
crowd -- it is also wedged in where it is and clearly wont go
anywhere unless its knocked loose -- so --

PARRISH CAREFULLY CLIMBS OVER THE EDGE

to tentatively drop to a narrow ledge -- high above the crowd
Parrish cautiously moves across the ledge to try to get to the
vial but it is placed higher than he is

HARRY

sees this and runs to the opposite end of the same ledge --

-- Harry drops down over the roof and gets on the ledge -- he
slips but recovers his footing and starts toward the vial --

BELOW IN THE STREET - MEMBERS OF THE CROWD SEE ALL THIS
-- instead of running away the crowd thickens pointing up --
FRONT VIEW OF THE HAY-ADAMS - HARRY AND PARRISH

move across the building along opposite sides of the ledges
Both men reach the end of their respective ledges separated

by

a twenty foot gap Parrish strains but the vial is wedged just

out of reach He or Harry will have to jump to get at it
Parrish looks at Harry contemptuously --

PARRISH

You shouldnt have come Harry It was the
right thing to do but you still shouldnt
have done it

(beat)
The bacteria will set her blood on fire
Her skin will peel off in sheets Shell
feel every part of her body liquefy
because her nervous system will go last
Itll take hours

(beat)
If youd gone to her youd have had the
same mercy you left me you could save the
only person who ever meant anything to you
by incinerating her Instead youve
sacrificed her without stopping me

(almost smiles)
Youve blown the solution Harry

HARRY
No Youve got it backwards
(beat)
The solution is going to blow you

Harry takes a cylindrical rgen flare out of his jacket

-- and the helicopter returns hovering over the hotel edge
Harry waves the flare in a signal -- as --

CLOSE ON PARRISHS FACE

-- he knows theres only one way left for him to win --

-- Parrish leaps off the ledge and toward the vial -- as --
IN THE COPTER - RACHEL

holds steady -- and reaches for the FUEL DUMP lever --

UNDERNEATH THE COPTER - THE FUEL TANKS EMPTY
in a spray of gasoline -- driven by the prop wash it turns

a column of fine mist down the front of the hotel --
ON PARRISHS LEAP

-- Parrish reaches the vial -- with a sweep of his hand the
vial is knocked still intact out of its perch --

Parrish and the vial fall separately toward the canopy as t
aerated fuel showers right behind them --

-- The vial strikes a flagpole extending from the front of t
building -- the glass shatters exposing the bacteria -- but

IN THE HELICOPTER - RACHEL

shoves the FUEL DUMP lever back and banks the copter away --

-- the copter rapidly turns away ending the fuel dump -- as --

-- the spiralling thrown flare moves into the heart of the fuel
cloud and ignites it -- from the center it burns out --

PARRISH

has almost fallen to the canopy -- but his face shows he knows
hes been beaten here -- we see what he sees --

PARRISHS POV - FOOT 1 F FIRE

surges down toward him -- it unmistakably incinerates all the

bacterial fluid just before it catches up to Parrish --
PARRISHS BODY IS BLOWN THROUGH THE STONE CANOPY

by his fall and the explosive force of the cloud The Canopy has
provided a floor for the column of fire elevating it safely
above the crowd -- but now the cloud burns up --

VIEW DOWN FRONT OF HOTEL - HARRY

is directly above the sheet of fire thats racing up -- he leaps
for the roofs edge and pulls himself up and over just as the
sheet of flame shoots up past him --

On the roof Harry catches his breath slightly singed -- as --
FRONT VIEW OF HOTEL - OF FLAME Bi ITSELF

in an instant leaving residual traces of fire -- the hotels
flags are in flaming tatters but the hotel will survive

ON THE ROOF - THE HELICOPTER SWINGS AROUND
and Harry jumps in breathless but far from relieved --

HARRY
Lets get to Kaylie

Harry pulls the door shut and the copter speeds off -- as --
AT THE BED AND BREAKFAST - IN THE OUTER GROUNDS - KAYLIE
has dressed and is following the clue to the stables On a barn
there is a sign with a horse -- freshly painted on it is a ball
with a fish Kaylie checks behind it and finds a page --

Think of light think of bright

Kaylie looks across and sees a lantern hanging from a tree

IN THE HELICOPTER - HARRY TURNS TO RACHEL

impatiently -- the ride feels incredibly slow
HARRY
Cant we go any faster
RACHEL
No Were almost out of fuel
AT THE VIRGINIA BED AND BREAKFAST GROUNDS - KAYLIE

steps up to the brightly glowing lantern hanging from a tree in
the middle of nowhere Another Seuss page is hanging there

Think of stairs in the night
Kaylie turns and looks across the grounds Far off she sees --
-- a set of stairs that are part of a Revolutionary War fort
stretching a hundred feet up the hillside Kaylie runs toward
it as the distant SOUND of a helicopter can barely be heard --
BINOCULAR POV - KAYLIE RUNS ACROSS THE FIELD
-- from this far-off view she is a small figure --

when the fuel-starved engine sputters Rachel starts it down --

HARRY
What are you doing Were almost there --

RACHEL
If I dont land here now well crash --
cuts off another protest)

-- well crash and hell win
Rachel continues landing -- all Harry can do is sit and wait
IN THE RUINS - AT A STAIRCASE KAYLIE IS SMILING
This is cool In the stone stairs she finds another page --

Think left think right

Kaylie veers off to her right into a stone room -- as --
ANGLE ON HELICOPTER COMING DOWN

-- its on fumes -- on the last thirty feet the engine dies out
altogether and comes down on a rough autorotation --

THE HELICOPTER LANDS ROUGHLY IN THE CLEARING - HARRY

throws open the door to bolt across the clearing but we see he
is at least a couple of hundred yards from the fortress --

INSIDE THE RUINS - KAYLIE

finds another note -- she knows shes close now --

Think low

Kaylie looks down a page is under a rock on the floor
HARRY REACHES THE TOP OF THE FORTRESS
He looks down and sees light streaming out of a low window --
INSIDE THE RUINS - KAYLIE
picks up the note under from the rock -- it reads --
Think high

Kaylie shines the light to a high point in the room -- atop a
tall stack of rocks is one of the figures she collects --

CLOSE ON THE TOY - THE PLASTIC BUBBLE
has the final Seuss page taped to it --
Oh the Thinks you can Think if only you try

In the bubble the toy holds the last bacterial vial sealed so
delicately that if it tips it will definitely spill out --

ON THE ROCKS - KAYLIE

starts climbing up carefully -- as --

HIGHER UPIN THE RUINS - HARRY

runs down recklessly stumbling through the dark stairs --
KAYLIE CLIMBS UP THE ROCKS

-- she slips but catches herself against the wall --
