She shines through it with an affected brightness

KAYLA

Hey guys It’s Kayla Back with
another video I haven’t been
getting tons of views on these so
if you like them please share them
with your friends I’d really
appreciate it Coolso um
today I want to talk to you guys
about - Being Yourself Okay so
like Being Yourself What does
that mean Like aren’t I always
Being Myself Well like yes for
sure But “Being Yourself” also
means like not changing the um--

(looks down at her lap)
--uhsorry I’m reading these off
a piece of paper-- OKAY “Being
Yourself” also means like not
changing yourself to be cool or
like to try to impress a guy or
whatever

As she speaks her eyes wander with her thoughts She plays
with her hair twirling it around a finger tilting her head
to piece out a thin strand with both hands then fixing it

She does this constantly

KAYLA (CONTD)
And it’s really important to Be
Yourself because like you could be
the most popular kid at school or
have like the hottest boyfriend or
whatever but if you’re not Being
Yourself then like what’s the
point Cause like if you aren’t
Being Yourselfthen what’s the
poi-I said that already Okay
-okay Sookay but what makes
Being Yourself hard sometimes is
that it’s not always easy

(MORE)

KAYLA (CONTD)
Cause sometimes people will make
fun of you for Being Yourself but
you just have to ignore them
because you are Being Yourself and
that’s good and if someone’s being
mean that sucks but evil people
exist and you can’t change that
Okayand you can’t let other
people tell you who you are Like
for instance like sometimes people
say that I’m shy or quiet just
because I don’t talk a lot at
school or whatever But just
because I’m quiet sometimes
doesn’t meanokay likelike
I’m not shy Like if someone is
nice then I will talk to them and I
can be really funny and fun to talk
to But like just cause I’m not
talking all the time like everyone
else doesn’t mean that I’m a quiet
person It just means that I
like I’m not scared to talk I
just choose not to Okay so
like yeah you should Be Yourself
and don’t worry what other people
think and if they think you’re
something that you’re not just let
it go and try to not care and
eventually everything will work
out Cool So hopefully some of you
found this video helpful Please
remember to share this video and
subscribe to my channel Thanks for
watching Byeee

A WIDE VIEW reveals

Kayla sitting in the corner of her room her laptop open on
the desk in front of her a bland colored backdrop hung on
the wall behind her

She reaches forward closes the laptop and sits in the dark

Alone

INT BEDROOM THE NEXT MORNING

The bedroom is small and brightly-colored Posters of pop
stars and movie stars and pretty photos on the wall A twin
bed with a massive pink down comforter and something tiny
beneath it
A BUBBLY ELECTRO-POP SONG fades up

Just as the song starts to get loud just as the song starts
to reveal itself as the perfect accompaniment for a spring
morning the pink comforter on the bed stirs and a tiny hand
emerges turning off the song that’s blaring from an iPhone
plugged in on the bedside table

Kayla emerges from the bed in her pajamas She gets up and
stretches making weird morning sounds in the quiet room

INT KAYLA’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

BEGIN SEQUENCE

-- Post-it notes lining the border of a large bathroom
mirror Reminders and lyrics and quotes “TRUST YOURSELF”
“DONT JUST FLY SOAR” “BE YOUR OWN KIND OF BEAUTIUFL” “GET

INT BACK IN HER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

SEQUENCE CONTINUES

climbing back into bed

hair She puts her head on the pillow lifts her iPhone and
takes a selfie straining to seem casual

She looks at her phone

-- ON KAYLA’S PHONE SCREEN Kayla is on Instagram posting

the selfie of her “waking up” She chooses a filter She
captions the photo “just woke up ughhhhh” She posts it

ELECTRONIC MUSIC LOUD BRIGHT

MACRO SHOTS a grid of a thousand pixels forming pictures
text moving images then closer to the stark reality of a
Liquid Crystal Display dozens of rectangular blocks of
light the SUBPIXELS in repeating groups of three
redbluegreen arranged in rows and columns so close now
that no image can form no colors even beyond the three
present flashing and pulsing with abstract order

Redbluegreenblueredgreenblueredbluegreenredbluegreenbluered

EXT SUBURBAN STREET LATER

Kayla now dressed for school walks down the sidewalk Her
massive backpack forces her to lean forward hands clutching
the shoulder straps She has headphones in We follow her
close at eye-level

The world is big She is small and moving quickly through it

EXT ANOTHER STREET LATER

Kayla walks headphones blaring The sun is shining She
doesn’t notice A car passes and someone inside screams at
Kayla as it whizzes by
Kayla doesn’t notice

EXT ANOTHER STREET LATER

Kayla keeps walking Stops Takes out her iPhone and looks
at it

ON THE SCREEN her Instagram photo has received zero likes
and one comment The comment from asherk1313 reads “ew”

Kayla stares at the phone and deletes her photo She looks up
and hustles across the street

Pan to reveal MILES GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL a giant brick
building wide and sturdy beyond a large parking lot

Kayla walks toward it getting smaller and eventually
disappearing into the mass of kids and cars and buses that
are all being pulled inward toward the school

WOMANS VOICE (VO)
Your body is changing

INT HALLWAY LATER

Kayla walks down the crowded hallway backpack on Rather
than the sounds of the busy hallway we hear a calm adult
female voice and the cheesy educational score accompanying
her

WOMAN’S VOICE (VO)
This change can be scary But this
change is a good thing It means
that you are becoming an adult
Kayla walks moving forward head down
WOMAN’S VOICE (VO)

You may have noticed hair starting
to grow in new places

INT BATHROOM LATER
Kayla sits on the toilet in a stall
WOMAN’S VOICE (VO)
You may have noticed hair starting

to grow in new places

Kayla reaches for toilet paper
INT BATHROOM MOMENTS LATER

THREE GIRLS stand in front of the three available
mirrors preening themselves Kayla stands behind them her
hands out awkwardly waiting to wash them

WOMANS VOICE (VO)
You may have begun to gain some
weight or grow tallerThis is
normalThis is healthy

Kayla waits hands out The three girls don’t notice her

INT ART CLASS LATER

Kayla sits at a long dirtied table in the back of the art
class working on something with her hands

It’s some weird clay thing Like a sculpturefacemug grey
and soft and shiny and wet and Kayla is molding it with her
hands putting the finishing touches onto something that is
turning around nothing like she hoped it would

WOMANS VOICE (VO)
Your bodyis an amazing thing

A BANGING sound Kayla looks over to see a large BOY sitting beside her punching his clay into the table with
both hands

INT HALLWAY LATER

Kayla waits at the water fountain behind a GIRL who is
drinking at it

WOMAN’S VOICE (VO)
And your body deserves respect By
understanding exactly how your body
is changing you are respecting
your body and yourself

The girl finally stops drinking then immediately reaches
into her backpack takes out an empty water bottle and begins
filling it at the fountain Kayla waits

INT CLASSROOM LATER

The room is dark and a TV has been wheeled out in front of
the students We see THE WOMAN (40s) who has been speaking on
the screen - looking directly into camera Behind the TV
MRS NOLAN (50s) works behind her desk

The students watch the movie with a mixture of awe confusion
and disgust In the back Kayla cranes her neck to see

WOMAN ON THE TV
Over the course of these next
thirty minutes we will begin to
explore and understand these
changing bodies of yours

Kayla gives up trying to see She looks around bored - sees
something

ACROSS THE ROOM - a STRANGE BOY has his head tucked in his
shirt the glow of his phone illuminating from inside the
fabric he’s secretly watching a video

And doing something else
Kayla stares Confused

WOMAN ON THE TV (CONT’D)
Chapter One The Hair Down There

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
TRISTAN ARE YOU MASTURBATING

A silence Then the class FREAKS OUT Laughs and screams and
“ewwws Mrs Nolan tries to calm them down

MRS NOLAN
Hey Quiet QUI-ET

It’s no use It’s chaos Boys point and laugh Girls scream
and heckle in disgust Tristan denies everything Mrs Nolan
fails to control the situation

And way in the back Kayla sits quietly

As commotion in the classroom builds and crescendos we hear
something else an orchestra swelling and overtaking the
noise of the kids as we cut to--

INT HALLWAY LATER

Kayla walks down the hallway We hear only the orchestra
straining to play correctly bum notes everywhere sections
off tempo instruments out of tune the whole piece dragging
and plodding along a ton of effort little success

Kayla walks down the hallway The orchestra strains to score
the moment
INT AUDITORIUM DAY

The stage of the auditorium and the source of the sound
weve been hearing a fifty-piece student orchestra is mid-
performance the MUSIC TEACHER standing in front of them
conducting

We drift through the students trumpet players with red
faces violinists with poor posture clarinet players with
split reeds squeaking out a high harmony

It’s a mess

We arrive at the back where Kayla is stationed one giant
CYMBAL in each hand waiting for her moment

The song ends and she smacks them together a fraction late

CRASSSSHHHHHHH

A pause Then light applause

INT AUDITORIUM MOMENTS LATER
Kayla sits in the audience with her classmates

INT BAND PRACTICE ROOM LATER

The eighteen superlative winners sit in the Band Room amongst
the music stands and instruments

Kayla sits by herself

She looks over at a GROUP OF GIRLS who are inspecting and
sharing at each other’s Time Capsules -- bright shoeboxes
full of personal trinkets The girls laugh and do a lot of
“OH my god”s and “shut UP”s

Kayla looks down at her Time Capsule sitting on her lap --
the outside made purple and pink with construction paper On
the top of the shoebox’s lid in large glittery pink

lettering sixth-grade Kayla wrote

MR MCDANIEL
AidenAIDEN

TIME SLOWS and MUSIC BLASTS as AIDEN WILSON-CARTER (13

perfect) looks up from his phone in the back of the room His

face is blank and bored His eyes are the best

He gets up and walks toward the front of the room in slow
motion annoyed and bored Kayla turns and looks at him her
face deflating into awe - he somehow gets hotter every time

she sees him

He passes her and the music stops abruptly and we snap back

into real time just in time to hear a faint breathy

KAYLA
Good j-

Aiden arrives at the front of the room

KENNEDY
Hey Aiden

AIDEN
Hey

KENNEDY
(fishing)
So embarrassing that we got voted

AIDEN
(almost a robot)

Kennedy and Aiden follow Mr McDaniel out of the room Kayla
watches them leave and then looks down at the time capsule in

her lap

TO THE COOLEST GIRL IN THE WORLD

Kayla gently lifts the lid off of the shoebox She begins
removing and inspecting things A movie ticket stub A small
frog figurine A Justin Bieber magnet

Then a picture of a young Kayla on a field trip with her
class She’s smiling in this picture Surrounded by her
classmates

She’s about to close the capsule when she spots something A
TINY PLASTIC SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS She picks it up with two
fingers and stares at it

The plastic Spongebob stares back as we hear a door open

MR MCDANIEL (0S)
(whispering)
ShhhhheyheyI’m looking
for Mr and Mrs Most Quiet Andrew
Fields and Kayla Day Shhhh

Kayla looks up -

INT MUSIC CLASSROOM MOMENTS LATER

A PHOTOGRAPHER (50s tired) sits on a stool behind a camera
and tripod Mr McDaniel enters the room trailed by Kayla
and ANDREW FIELDS (13 silent very weird)

MR MCDANIEL
Alright guys just pop a squat over
there and we’ll get a few glamour
shots

Kayla and Andrew walk over to the “photo shoot area” -- two
adjacent chairs set up in front of a hung backdrop flanked
by mounted lights and reflecting umbrellas They sit

MR MCDANIEL (CONTD)
So weve been trying to do sort of
funny poses that reflect the
superlatives Like for the Most
Athletic Danny pretended to be
running for a touchdown and Olivia
pretended to be tackling him So
it should be fun you know You
guys have any ideas

No response obviously

MR MCDANIEL (CONTD)
Oh Maybe Andrew you could be
holding a book and Kayla maybe
you could be shushing him like
youre at a library or something

PHOTOGRAPHER
Battery’s dead Gotta run to my
car

MR MCDANIEL
Oh okay No problemYou know
what I think I’11 run to the
restroom Hang tight kids

The Photographer and Mr McDaniel exit Kayla and Andrew sit
together alone side-by-side

Kayla fidgets with her nails busy Andrew stares straight
ahead slack-jawed teeth in braces ostensibly brain-dead

They are quiet from two totally different places -- self-
consciousness and unconsciousness

They sit in silence for a FULL MINUTE Sixty excruciating
seconds No one enters

EXT SCHOOL LATER

Kayla exits the school wearing her backpack An SUV pulls up
and honks Kennedy Graves (Miss Best Eyes) climbs into the
passenger seat DIANNE GRAVES (40s) shouts past her daughter
to Kayla

DIANNE GRAVES
Hey Little one

She honks Kayla notices walks over hesitantly Kennedy
rolls her eyes

DIANNE GRAVES (CONTD)

KENNEDY

KAYLA
Bye

They drive away Kayla stands in place staring straight
ahead perfectly still

Then suddenly she RUNS We follow her close as she
sprints across the parking lot away from the school

EXT STREET MOMENTS LATER

Kayla continues her sprint down the sidewalk her backpack
weighing her down forcing her to run awkwardly in weird
forceful lunges She breathes heavily running as hard as she
can with the weight on her back

She sprints across the street tiring but pushing through
down a sidewalk then another street passing a woman walking
her dog a couple kids walking back from school she runs
past them her arms swinging to counteract the backpack that
wants to pull her down

She forces herself forward
Can’t anymore

She slows and collapses onto a patch of grass backpack
first like a flipped turtle

She closes her eyes and catches her breath nearly
hyperventilating

As her breath returns she slowly rocks to her side lifts
herself to her feet and continues in the same direction she
had just been running - now just walking head down

INT DINING ROOM KAYLA’S HOUSE NIGHT

CLOSE ON on Kayla’s iPad Her tiny finger opens her iTunes
app and selects a BRIGHT CHEERY POP SONG It plays loudly

Her tiny finger touches the screen minimizing iTunes and
opening her Instagram app

She scrolls through the feed people she follows

ready to suck 1lol1l11111” A PICTURE OF THREE GIRLS HER AGE
PAINTING THEIR NAILS captioned “friday nite nail party

Kayla scrolls past dozens of photos - all showing various
fun eighth-grade Friday nights being had by her classmates

A wide view reveals Kayla’s Friday night a quiet dinner at
home with DAD

Homemade chicken breast and green beans on each of their
plates Two bowls of extras between them Kayla scrolls
through her iPhone with her headphones in the iPad propped
up on a stand in front of her plate of food

Dad eats quietly Kayla doesn’t touch her plate the sounds
of Kayla’s music now buzzing quietly in her ears

DAD

Dad stops as he notices that Kayla has put her headphones
back in and is staring at her iPhone not listening to him

DAD (CONTD)

He crumples up a napkin and tosses it across the table
hitting Kayla in the head

Kayla rips out her headphones

KAYLA
Then let me use my iPad

Dad sees that this isn’t going anywhere

DAD

Dad smiles sad as his daughter puts her headphones back in
and stares at her iPad

They sit in silence
DAD (CONTD)

Dad laughs Kayla stares at her iPad Dad gives up for now
goes back to eating

They sit in silence

INT KAYLA’S BEDROOM LATER

Kayla lies on her bed earbuds in buzzing quietly her
laptop open on her chest She is BROWSING THE INTERNET

She stares at her computer screen her face is in blank
contrast to the things she’s looking at MUSIC VIDEOS
ARTICLES PICTURES EVERYTHING EVERY PIECE OF CULTURE EVER
RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF HER IN BRIGHT LIGHT

Her phone buzzes
She shuts her laptop

On her phone’s homescreen two notifications from Twitter
ONE NEW FOLLOWER ONE NEW DIRECT MESSAGE

She opens her Twitter app In her notifications KENNEDY
GRAVES JUST FOLLOWED YOU

She goes into her direct messages There’s a fresh message
from Kennedy Hi so my mom said to invite you to my thing
tomorrow so this is me doing that

Kayla stares at the ‘invitation’ She clicks on Kennedys
name and is brought to Kennedy’s twitter profile She has a
cute profile picture

Her latest tweet was a tweet to awcl23 hey mr best eyes

Kayla clicks on awcl23 and is brought to AIDEN’S PROFILE
His profile picture is a douchey photo of him looking sweaty
after a lacrosse game

Kayla plugs in her headphones goes to iTunes in her phone
selects a pop song and blasts it scoring the following

She returns to Aiden’s twitter page Goes to the MEDIA
section and scrolls through the photos and videos he’s
posted breathing heavily A selfie A pic after practice

Then something stops her A video Aiden has posted titled
STRAIGHT FLEXIN BRUH She clicks it

It’s an iPhone video Aiden took of himself He’s wearing a
tank top and flexing his muscles in his bathroom mirror

Kayla watches it She watches him Her heart practically
vibrating

She brings her hand up to her mouth and bites her nails
Aiden flexes smiles Kayla stops biting Keeps her hand at
her mouth As the song climaxes Kayla turns her hand over
and kisses it

Aiden keeps flexing as Kayla begins to full-on make out with
the back of her hand eyes closed like Aiden and her are
kissing in the rain The music follows suit

Then A KNOCK ON HER DOOR

Kayla jumps rips out her headphones and THROWS her iPhone
across the room It makes an awful sound

KAYLA
UHH WHAT

DAD (0S)
I’m going to bed

KAYLA
OKAY

DAD

Alright good night

KAYLA

DAD

KAYLA

We hear Dad leave as Kayla rolls over and off the bed She
walks across the room to her iPhone It’s screen down on the
ground

KAYLA
Pleasepleasepleaseplease

Kayla picks up the phone and turns it over

THE SCREEN IS CRACKED

Behind the violent web of jagged black lines her homescreen
is a picture of Demi Lovato laughing The time 1113 PM

KAYLA
Sssssssshit Shitshitshit

Kayla grunts and whines so angry she could cry She flops
back onto her bed lies down stares at the ceiling Ugh

Then with sudden purpose still mad she sits up rolls off
her bed walks across the room and unzips her backpack She
takes out her TIME CAPSULE puts it on the floor rips off
the top fishes through the box grabs something and storms
back to bed

She get under the covers and lays still The room is dark

She brings her hand up close to her face and we see what she
grabbed out of the box

The tiny plastic SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS She stares Spongebob
stares back She rips Spongebob from his Squarepants - it’s a
USB DRIVE

She grabs her laptop and opens it HARSH LIGHT She plugs the
Spongebob in to her laptop and minimizes her browser The USB
appears on the desktop as an icon “16GB FileSystem”

Kayla clicks it The drive contains one video file

It’s titled “DEAR 8TH GRADE KAYLA”

Kayla puts her headphones in Stares at her screen
Hesitates Then clicks

We hear Kayla’s voice It’s younger

YOUNG KAYLA (0S)

Young Kayla laughs We stay on our Kayla never seeing what’s
playing on the screen

YOUNG KAYLA (VO)

The sound stops Kayla stares
ON THE SCREEN we get our only glimpse at the sixth-grade
Kayla frozen in her seat giving a smile and a wave to the

camera Her face is smaller Rounder

Kayla Xs out of the video Closes her laptop Opens her phone
Aiden’s video is still up behind the cracked glass Kayla Xs
out of it

She clicks on her direct messages The message from Kennedy

Kayla thinks

EXT KENNEDY’S HOUSE THE NEXT DAY

Low angle on a colossal MCMANSION Green lawn that looks
fake Stone walkway It’s all just big and gross and scary

Dad’s pickup truck is parked in front of it Kayla sits
shotgun staring out the window away from Dad who stares at
her from the drivers seat Kayla doesn’t move A long
silence

DAD
I’m so glad you’re doing this
This’ll be good I think you’re
gonna have a lot of fun

KAYLA
Mmm

Kayla keeps staring at the house tense Doesn’t move

DAD
Want me to walk you in

KAYLA
No

Kayla keeps staring Dad sits patiently Kayla takes a deep
breath and exits the car holding a backpack and a small
wrapped gift

DAD
Text me when you want to get picked
up

KAYLA
Okay

Kayla shuts the door and walks towards the front door The
sounds of splashing and screaming in the backyard The sounds
are strange and abstract and unsettling

They get louder as she gets closer to the house
Kayla arrives at the front door and rings the doorbell She
turns and sees Dad still parked on the street She shoos him

annoyed He waves back and drives away

The door opens Dianne Graves stands in the doorway smiling
a bit too wide

DIANNE
Kayylaaaa

KAYLA
Hi Mrs Graves

DIANNE
Oh please call me Dianne

KAYLA
Okay

DIANNE
Where’s your father

KAYLA
He drove away

DIANNE
Mmm bummer Everyone’s out back by
the pool Did you bring a swimsuit

KAYLA
Yeah it’s in my bag

DIANNE
Great Come on inside and we’1ll get
you changed

Dianne puts her hand on Kayla’s back and leads her inside
closing the door behind them

The foyer of the house is huge Kayla looks around It’s the
largest house she’s ever been in

DIANNE (CONTD)
You can put your gift right over
there on the dining room table

Dianne turns Kayla towards the dining room and a table piled
with wrapped birthday presents

Kayla adds her small gift to the huge mass making no
difference

DIANNE (CONTD)
Well open gifts after cake Here
let’s find you a bathroom to change
in

KAYLA
Okay

Dianne leads Kayla out of the dining room and down a hallway
towards the back of the house Dianne opens one of the many
closed doors in the hallway

DIANNE
You can change in here And then
the kids are just out back through
the sliding door just out there
okay honey

KAYLA
Okay Thank you Dianne

DIANNE
No problem

Kayla walks into the BATHROOM and closes the door The party
outside is closer and louder now The small marble room is
dark lit only by a single bright window that flickers as
unseen kids run past it outside

Kayla is careful to remain unseen by the party as she unpacks
her bag standing close to the window’s wall out of view

The shadows of the kids outside are projected on the wall
across from her in sharp dizzying negatives

The party’s loudness is intense and constant

INT KENNEDY’S HOUSE MOMENTS LATER

Kayla walks out of the bathroom and towards the bright glow
of the sliding glass door She approaches the glass Stops
Stares out into the backyard

EXT KENNEDY’S BACKYARD LATER

The pool party is in full peripubescent swing In and around
the pool A DOZEN GIRLS (13-14) and another DOZEN BOYS (13-
14) swim and splash and dive and yell and laugh The boys are
shirtless the girls are in bikinis

The boys flirt with the girls in that aggressive
antagonistic way young teens do Splashing them to get their
attention Wrestling with them just to touch them The girls
pretend not to like it

A FEW BOYS play an overly-intense game of pool basketball in
the shallow-end showing off to the few girls around them
floating on pool noodles

Kennedy does a perfect dive off the diving board making a
pea-sized splash upon entry A BOY squirts a Super Soaker at
a GIRL running around the perimeter of the pool

It’s a hormonal frenzy A grape soda bacchanalia

BY THE HOUSE the sliding glass door opens and Kayla makes
her non-entrance wearing a green one-piece swimsuit She
steps out of the house and onto the stone walkway

She looks at everyone No one looks back

She walks towards the shallow end of the pool A boy MASON
(14 athletic) runs past her

MASON
Z Z HIT ME YO Z HIT ME

Madison jumps into the pool as a BASKETBALL comes whizzing
towards him which he catches and DUNKS in the hoop before
hitting the water Kayla flinches from the splash

WOMAN’S VOICE (0S)
Woo Mason Nice one

GINA DEGROSSO (40s sunglasses) appears beside Kayla notices
her

GINA
Oooo honey do you have sunblock

KAYLA
Huh No

GINA
You poor thing you’re gonna fry
without some sunblock Here put
your arms out

KAYLA
I can do it

GINA
It’s a bit cold

Gina SPRAYS sunblock onto Kayla’s shoulders Kayla winces
with each cold squirt Gina rubs it into Kayla’s arms and
shoulders Kayla stands and takes it looking like a 7 year-
old

A FEW GIRLS on the diving board notice this and laugh

Gina stops

GINA (CONTD)
There you go

KAYLA
(ugh)
Thank you

Kayla walks toward the built-in steps in the pool’s shallow
end She gets in the pool step by step First up to her
ankles then shins thighs waist stomach and finally chest

The water is cold and each step makes her inhale sharply

She waddles along on her tiptoes The water’s surface is an
embarrassing and perfect measurement of height

People splash and talk all around her without acknowledging
her presence Kayla doggy paddles over to an empty corner of
the pool and dips down in the water up to her neck She stays
still

DIANNE
Hotdogs and hamburgers in 20
minutes

On the diving board Kennedy is being bear-hugged and
wrestled into the pool by TYLER (14 cute) Kayla watches

KENNEDY
Tyler Seriously Seriously
SERIOUSLY TYLER

TYLER
You’re going in Don’t fight it

KENNEDY
Uurghh noooo

Tyler sends Kennedy and himself into the pool in a clumsy
tangle They splash and resurface Tyler laughing Kennedy
faux-furious

KENNEDY (CONTD)
I hate you Oh my GOD

Kayla watches - hating it wanting it - her chin resting on
the surface of the water Then she sees something that makes
her forget how to breathe

Aiden He’s on the diving board Shirtless Once again TIME
SLOWS and MUSIC BLASTS as he runs to the end of the board
jumps and does the sexiest cannonball that Kayla has ever
seen A large splash

Kayla watches mouth open slightly He resurfaces swims over
to the pool’s edge and pulls himself out He sits on the lip
of the pool looks at someone gives them double middle
fingers Incredibly cool

Kayla watches him then BWUHHHHH - a small wiry boy emerges
from the water directly beside Kayla wearing a wet t-shirt
and a large pair of clunky scuba goggles He coughs up water
and gasps This is GABE and he is out of breath

GABE
All the way Did it all the way

KAYLA
What

GABE
Swam all the way across the pool
underwater

KAYLA
Oh cool

GABE
Could’ve went further if I wanted

Gabe catches his breath Breathing through his nose and
fogging up his giant goggles

GABE (CONTD)
What’s your name

KAYLA
Kayla

GABE
Cool I’m Gabe - wanna see me do a
handstand

KAYLA
Okay

Gabe ducks underwater A second later his legs shoot up from
the water splashing Kayla They flail clumsily fall over
and he resurfaces coughing and catching his breath again

GABE
Too many people in the pool Can’t
do it for long if the water isn’t
still How do you know Kennedy

KAYLA
Umwe go to school together

GABE
Cool She’s my cousin I’m gonna
try again--

He dips back down Legs back up splashing Kayla He lasts a
second longer resurfaces

GABE (CONTD)
Water’s not calm enough How old
are you

KAYLA
Thirteen

GABE
Cool I’m twelve Want to doa
breath holding contest

KAYLA
Sure

GABE
Cool One two three-

Gabe takes a giant breath and goes underwater Kayla a bit
behind plugs her nose closes her eyes and does the same

UNDERWATER -- Kayla uses her free hand to paddle and keep
herself submerged

After ten seconds Kayla resurfaces panting She wipes the
water off her face and looks over at Gabe He’s floating face
down in the water perfectly still like a drowned corpse

Just as Kayla is getting concerned he resurfaces panting

GABE (CONTD)
I won The trick is to waste as
little energy as possible When you
move your body uses oxygen and
then you won’t be able to hold your
breath as long

KAYLA
That makes sense

DIANNE
PICTURE TIME

Dianne stands by the pool’s edge with a digital camera

KENNEDY
Mommmm

DIANNE
Oh hush Girls first GIRLS All
girls by the diving board

The girls group by the board Kayla watches

GABE
(to Kayla)
She said all the girls by the
diving board

KAYLA
Right

Kayla climbs out of the pool and walks over to the girls

They are already posing together - hands on hips peace
signs arms around each other Kayla stands in the back
blocked

DIANNE
Make sure we can see everyone
Kayla Kayla Up front honey
can’t see you

Kayla awkwardly makes her way to the front of the group A
few girls give her weird looks

DIANNE (CONTD)
That’s it

The girls all pose in a tangled wet mass - except for Kayla
who crouches awkwardly up front

DIANNE (CONTD)
Smile
(takes picture)
Perfect

KENNEDY
Can we get one of just The Squad

DIANNE
Sure Okay Squad members only for
this one

Kayla AND ONLY KAYLA shuffles out of the group

DIANNE (CONTD)
Great Smile

The girls pose They look like weird wet ducks

EXT KENNEDY’S BACKYARD LATER

Everyone is sitting around a patio table watching Kennedy
open her presents Kayla looks on wrapped in a towel
shivering standing just outside the group Kennedy opens a
box

KENNEDY
Yessssss

It’s a yellow tank top

KENNEDY (CONTD)
Oh my god so cute

STEPH
I know you have ones like it

KENNEDY
Not in this color

STEPH
That’s what I was thinking

Kayla sneaks a look at Aiden who is sitting in a chair
bored towel hanging around his neck He looks over at Kayla
and she immediately looks away Dianne brings over a small
square box

DIANNE
This one is from Kayyyyla

Kennedy looks up and gives Kayla a half-smile Kayla gives
her a full smile and a little wave Kennedy opens the box
revealing a small card-based board game

KENNEDY
what is it

KAYLA
It’s a game it’s really fun You
you um you take turns - like
everyone gets ten cards and then
you take turns doing - you’ll see
It’s like Go Fish but funner

KENNEDY
»-Cool

The other girls contain their laughter

Kennedy puts the box aside Kayla shrinks

DIANNE
Okay next is Julia--
MAN (0S)
(singing)

HA-PPY BIRTH-DAY

INT KENNEDY’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM LATER

Drift through the LIVING ROOM where the girls and boys are
taking turns playing a KARAOKE VIDEO GAME Continue past
them down a hallway and into the LIVING ROOM where Kayla is
sitting alone on a chair by the window talking on the phone
quietly

KAYLA

Kayla hangs up Huffs Looks down at her phone

ON HER PHONE’S SCREEN still violently cracked Kayla opens
twitter and begins scrolling through her feed Scrolls down

Kayla winces looks at her thumb A tiny drop of blood She
cut herself on the cracked glass of her phone Kayla puts the
tiny cut to her mouth

Then

AIDEN (0S)
Oh sorry

Kayla turns freezes It’s Him

KAYLA

AIDEN

Aiden walks towards her purposefully sipping soda from a
cup with a crazy straw stuck in it He stops directly beside
her and bends down on one knee

KAYLA
Wh-

He reaches under her chair
AIDEN

charge it

KAYLA
(forced)

AIDEN (CONTD)
Everyone’s in there you know

KAYLA

AIDEN
Okay

Aiden leaves Kayla catches her breath She notices something
on the floor where Aiden knelt down -- HIS SODA AND CRAZY
STRAW Kayla makes sure no one is watching and then quickly
grabs the straw and sticks it in her back pocket

KAYLA (VO)

Hey guys It’s Kayla Back with
another video Today I want to talk
about - Putting Yourself Out There

She gets up and walks toward the family room

INT KENNEDY HOUSE FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The kids are piled on couches and chairs watching Z (13 a
big boy) who is standing and singing into a cheap microphone
in front of a giant flat-screen TV displaying a Karaoke Video
Game Z is hamming it up The others watch laugh

The scene looks raucous and loud but we hear none of it

Instead we hear Kayla’s speech to her webcam and the quiet
of the bedroom in which it is being delivered

Kayla enters the family room Stops in the doorway

KAYLA (VO)

Okay so like “Putting Yourself
Out There” What does that mean
Like Putting Yourself Out There
Where’s There Okay these are all
good questions but they’re also bad
questions

Kayla inches towards the couch stands behind it forces a
smile

KAYLA (VO)

Cause it’s really about Putting
Yourself Out Anywhere It doesn’t
matter like where you do it you
just have to do it Just Put
Yourself Out There Just go for it

Kayla tries leaning on the couch Tries a few different
positions

KAYLA (VO)
Now Putting Yourself Out There can
be really scary

(MORE )

KAYLA (VO) (CONTD)
So if you’re scared to Put Yourself
Out There like don’t worry cause
that’s normal and lots of people
feel that way

Z hits his final note arms out like a diva The kids laugh
and applaud Kayla does too Z turns and holds out the
microphone saying “Who’s next Who wants it”

KAYLA (VO)
I used to be scared but then I Put
Myself Out There and now I do it
all the time

Kayla looks around then at Z She clenches her jaw then
raises her hand Z notices and waves her over Kayla slowly
walks towards him

KAYLA (VO)
And the first time you Put Yourself
Out There is always the hardest

Kayla takes the microphone from Z She stands in the middle
of the large crowded semi-circle of kids in the family room

She has zero stage presence

KAYLA (VO)
But once you do it you’ll be
really glad that you did I
promise

Kayla looks up at the TV The song starts She begins to sing
quietly Not moving Stealing glances at the kids around her

They watch bored

KAYLA (VO)
So like next time you get the
chance to like play a game or sit
at a new lunch table or like I
don’t know go skydiving or
something you should do it

Kayla starts to sway back and forth as she sings picking up
steam

KAYLA (VO)
But once you Put Yourself Out
There things aren’t gonna change
right away

Kayla starts getting more into it A few hand gestures

Nothing major She closes her eyes

KAYLA (VO)
Think of Putting Yourself Out There
like a little snowball or
something Like you put the little
snowball up on a hill you Put It
Out There and then it’1ll roll down
the hill and get bigger and bigger
and bigger

Kayla sings and looks around kids are nodding and starting
to smile politely In the corner Gabe watches smiling huge

Kayla finally sees his face without those big goggles on He
is cute like her He gives her a very real and enthusiastic
double thumbs up

KAYLA (VO)
The first time I Put Myself Out
There like nothing really changed
at first But then I just kept
doing it and doing it and doing it

Kayla keeps singing looks at Aiden who is texting on the
couch

KAYLA (VO)
And now I have tons of friends who
really like me and I Put Myself Out
There all the time

Kayla closes her eyes and hits her big final note

KAYLA (VO)
So be brave Put Yourself Out
There It’s the best

The song ends She looks around Light unenthusiastic
applause from her peers Nothing major But for Kayla it’s a
huge win She looks around and smiles still holding the
microphone

INT KAYLA’S BEDROOM THAT NIGHT

Kayla is at her desk speaking to her webcam in the same
clothes that she was just singing in

MUSIC STARTS

BEGIN SEQUENCE

INT KAYLA’S BATHROOM

Kayla paces back and forth stealing looks at herself in the
mirror

Her face twisted into what many recognize as “I just smelled
something awful” but what Kayla recognizes as “I am cool and
I am confident and I don’t care”

She has fake conversations with unseen people

KAYLA
(quiet almost mumbled)

END OF SEQUENCE

INT CAFETERIA LATER

Kayla sits by herself in the crowded cafeteria her brown
bagged lunch beside her She is writing in a large school
notebook hunched over it her face six inches from the
paper

She has bisected the paper with a vertical line On the top
of the left side THINGS I WANT On the top of the right HOW

The sound of girls giggling and Kayla looks up sees someone
and quickly grabs a binder out of her backpack Tucked in the
inside pocket of the binder is a neatly folded piece of
paper with “KENNEDY” written on the outside

Kayla snatches the letter and gets up from her table and
approaches the giggling Kennedy and her friend Steph

KAYLA
Kennedy hey
They turn
KENNEDY
Hey
KAYLA

Hi thanks for letting me come to
your pool party

KENNEDY
No problem

KAYLA

umif you--

KENNEDY
Yeah sure Sounds good

KAYLA
Great Great seeing you guys Have
a great day

KENNEDY
Cool

They turn and leave Kayla walks back to her table smiling

Then we hear THREE LOUD GUNSHOTS

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY MORNING

A large man a SHOOTER wearing a Kevlar vest and a
Balaklava gas cannisters attached to a military belt
holding a large black automatic rifle strolls down an empty
hallway Firing shots ahead of him

The shots crack and echo GACK GACK GACK

He steps over a downed BODY and continues down the
hallway GACK GACK

A BRAVE BOY comes charging out of the boy’s bathroom
towards the shooter

BRAVE BOY
Oh my god A school shooter

The shooter easily picks him off - GACK GACK GACK He flops
dramatically to the ground “dead”

At the end of the hallway dozens of eighth-grade students
lean against the lockers creating a gauntlet for the shooter
to walk through The students watch him some bored some
riveted They are not scared

The Shooter removes his Balaklava he is OFFICER TODD (50s)
He speaks to the students

OFFICER TODD
OKAY Let’s give a big hand to our
volunteers from the drama club

The students lightly applaud as the dead bodies spattered
with fake blood get up and dust themselves off and bow

Kayla is leaned against a locker amongst her peers watching
Officer Todd

OFFICER TODD (CONT’D)
Now kids we’ve went over what you
should do if you hear gunshots in
the distance And what are we
supposed to do in that situation

STUDENTS
(unison)
Run in the opposite direction

Kayla mouths along as her attention shifts from Officer Todd
to someone else

It’s Aiden across the hallway looking impossibly bored
banging the back of his head slowly against the locker behind
him Kayla watches him A girl beside her DYLAN bullet
wound in the center of her forehead notices

DYLAN
You staring at Aiden

KAYLA
(embarrassed)
What

DYLAN
He’s a dick He dumped Chelsea
because she wouldn’t send him naked
pictures

KAYLA
Wh-really That’s weird

As Officer Todd continues to speak we switch between Aiden
being a bored brat and Kayla watching him straining to
figure out her mysterious sexy classmate

OFFICER TODD (0S)
Good But now we’re gonna learn
about what should be done when the
gunshots are close When the
shooter is just down the hallway or
just outside your classroom What
you just saw was an example of what
NOT to do If the shots are loud
and close and you are ina
classroom or bathroom you are to
STAY PUT TURN OFF THE LIGHTS FIND
COVER STAY CALM AND IF POSSIBLE
BARRICADE THE ENTRANCE

Aiden has begun trying to blow spit bubbles Kayla stares at
him biting her nails

OFFICER TODD (0S) (CONT’D)
If you are within range of the
shooter if you are in the same
hallway as the shooter YOU ARE TO
RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN If you
are being shot at or feel as if you
could be being shot at you should
run away in a ZIG-ZAG PATTERN This
will make you a harder target to
hit Attacking or rushing the
shooter WILL NOT WORK Negotiating
or pleading with the shooter WILL
NOT WORK If someone has entered
your school with a gun you are to
assume that he or she CANNOT BE
REASONED WITH If others have been
wounded lying down and staying
perfectly still can work This will
protect your vital organs and the
shooter may mistake you for one of
the dead BUT IF YOU CAN RUN RUN
DO NOT BE A HERO SAVE YOURSELF BE
YOUR OWN HERO AND SAVE YOURSELF

Kayla stares at Aiden

INT CLASSROOM LATER

The students sit at their desks MR DANKERT (30s quiet)
stands at the front of the classroom They are all waiting
for something An announcement on the intercom

OLDER WOMAN’S VOICE (INTERCOM)
COACH RED to the main office COACH
RED to the main office please

MR DANKERT
Alright guys that’s the signal

He turns off the lights All the students take cover under
their desks

MR DANKERT (CONTD)
Okay everyone please be respectful
of the drill and stay quiet Should
only be a few minutes

Mr Dankert climbs under his desk In the back Kayla is
crouched under hers Across the room she sees Aiden under
his desk playing a game on his phone She makes a decision
and slowly crawls towards him

She passes other students who give her weird looks as she
crawls on all fours across the classroom She arrives at
Aiden She whispers

KAYLA
Hey

He looks over at her doesn’t care goes back to his phone

AIDEN
Hey
KAYLA

AIDEN
Yep

After a long silence Kayla takes out her phone Starts
scrolling through it She keeps looking up at Aiden as she
does it seeing if he’s looking over at her He’s not

She pretends to see something on her phone that surprises her
and she holds the phone to her chest hiding the screen

KAYLA
Whoaoh man that was close That
was almost really embarrassing

She waits for Aiden to ask her about what just happened he

doesn’t

KAYLA (CONT’D)
Oh my god that was so funny Aiden

AIDEN

KAYLA
Oh my god it’s so embarrassing I

INT KAYLA’S BEDROOM DAY

Kayla sits on her bed cross-legged Her laptop in front of
her She has a small plastic bag of Cheez-Its

ON THE SCREEN - Google’s homepage Kayla types in the search
bar “how to give a blowjob” She pauses Adds a word “how

the results page

A list of helpful articles “BLOW LIKE A PRO 5 WAYS TO SUCK
IT LIKE A PORNSTAR” “eHOW THE INS AND OUTS OF THE BLOWJOB”

The first link is to a video entitled “BLOWJOB TIPS FROM
PROFESSIONAL BJ ARTIST LEXXI MAZE” Kayla clicks on the link
and is brought to the porn site

make sure you’re well hydrated
before you start

Even the low volume is too much Kayla reaches over to her
desk grabs her earbuds and plugs them into the computer

Lexxi’s voice stops Now we hear just a vague buzzing from
the earbuds as Kayla puts them in her ears and listens

Kayla watches the screen intensely as Lexxi says and does God
knows what We don’t see the screen or hear Lexxi We just
watch Kayla as she nibbles on Cheez-Its and tries to take
everything in

Kayla winces Squints

She stops eating her Cheez-Its Can’t even chew them

Kayla clenches her jaw Covers part of the screen with her
hand Looks away looks back This is way too much

Kayla shuts her laptop
Takes her earbuds out
Stares straight ahead

The room is quiet

INT KITCHEN MOMENTS LATER

Kayla stands at the refrigerator She opens the freezer
looks around moves a few things Nothing She tries the
fridge Opens a few drawers Nothing

She slowly turns toward the kitchen counter There ina
large wooden bowl atop half a dozen red delicious apples is
A BUNCH OF BANANAS

Kayla walks toward them like a nervous bride She picks up
the entire bunch Looks at it Looks at each of the five
bananas Picks one yanks it from the bunch and returns the
rest to the bowl

Kayla leans against the counter She grips the banana and
holds it a foot away from her face pointing it at her mouth
like a microphone (stem down)

She stares at it She stares hard It is yellow and brown and
weird-looking She closes her eyes and just as she opens her
mouth

The front door opens and Dad enters - wearing work boots and
jeans spattered with white paint Kayla jumps and lowers the
banana (still holds it) Acts casual

DAD
Hey Sorry didn’t mean to scare

KAYLA

DAD

KAYLA

DAD

asked you if you wanted a banana
and then you got all mad because
you said that you hate bananas and
I always forget that you hate
bananas I actually think I wrote a
note for it on my app thing so I
wouldn’t forget

Dad takes out his iPhone and plays with it

DAD (CONTD)

He holds up his phone showing the note he wrote

DAD (CONTD)
“Kayla hates bananas” I wrote it
down

KAYLA
Well I don’t hate them anymore

DAD
That’s great Yeah you always
gotta check to see if you still
hate stuff

KAYLA
Mhmm

A silence with only one solution Kayla grabs a hold of the
stem and peels the banana Dad watches her smiling Kayla
does her best not to react to that smell she hates so much

Kayla slowly brings the peeled banana to her mouth She
closes her eyes and opens her mouth The banana goes in She
bites chews tries not to gag tears welling in her eyes

DAD
You sure you like them

Kayla closes her eyes Tries to swallow Can’t
DAD (CONTD)
You really don’t seem to be

enjoying that

More chewing Tries to swallow again Gags

DAD (CONTD)
Honey you don’t look like--
Kayla SPITS out the banana

KAYLA
FINE I DON’T LIKE BANANAS HAPPY

She throws the banana at her father It hits him in the
chest He is too confused to flinch Kayla storms out of the
kitchen and into her room slamming the door shut
DAD
(to himself)
-no clue

Growing Up is that it’s GOING TO
HAPPEN So DON’T FIGHT IT Some
parts of Growing Up will be hard
and not good but I promise that
Growing Up will eventually get
REALLY GOOD I used to be afraid of
Growing Up but then I realized that

clenched breathing through her nose We get close and follow

her as she walks down the dark suburban street back moving
quickly tense and pained

INT KAYLA’S HOUSE LATER

Kayla walks through the front door moving quickly through
the house towards her room

DAD (0OS)

to her chest her arms wrapped around her knees her eyes
shut tight trying to collapse herself to a single point

CUT TO BLACK

KAYLA (VO)
Hey guys it’s Kayla

Her voice is quiet and unaffected her usual energy gone She
speaks slowly thinking out loud

INT KAYLA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM THE NEXT MORNING

Kayla standing in front of the mirror covers her face in
concealer Applies eyeliner

Her eyes are puffy from crying all night

KAYLA (VO)

a while and I’m sorry if that’s a
bummer for you but I think it’s the
right thing to do

INT MILES GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM LATER 64

It’s before class has started kids chat leaning towards
each other in their small desk chairs Kayla sits in the
middle of this talking to no one Zoning out

KAYLA (VO)

started making videos so I could
give like advice and stuff and
give you guys tips on what to do to
make your lives better or whatever
but umI don’t know it’s-

INT MILES GROVE CAFETERIA LATER

Kayla sits by herself eating a sandwich No list-making No
looking around her for kids to potentially approach She’s as
quiet as we’ve ever seen her but for the first time
resigned to be so

KAYLA (VO)
If I’m being really totally
honest I’m probably not the best
person to give advice cause I
don’t know I mean I like giving
advice and it’s fun to give advice
butI don’t knowI guess I
don’t really know how to do a lot
of stuff I know how to talk about
stuff but I’m not really good at
doing stuff

INT KAYLA’S HOUSE BATHROOM LATER

Kayla sits in a stall on the toilet browsing her phone
pants on just wanting some privacy

KAYLA
And I’mI’m really nervous
like all the time likefor
no reason

(MORE)

KAYLA (CONTD)
Like I’1l be nervous even when
there’s nothing to be nervous about
really Likeit’s sort of like
when you wait in line for a roller
coaster and you have that nervous
stomach like I feel like that all
the time like every day and I
don’t ever get that feeling you get
after you ride the roller coaster
when you feel better It’s just
like I’m waiting in the line all
the time And I try really hard not
feel like that but I don’t know I
just can’t

INT MILES GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY LATER

Kayla walks down the hallway her backpack on hands on
either strap by her shoulders her eyes somewhere on the
floor in front of her

KAYLA (VO)
And so like if you guys are going
through tough times or whatever
you deserve somebody who knows how
to get through tough times you
know Like you deserve someone
who’s good at making themselves
feel better cause then maybe they
can help you feel better

Kayla turns a corner and continues down the hallway and away
from us On a nearby wall is a bulletin board displaying the
eighth grade class superlatives

KAYLA (VO)
So yeah those are um some of the
reasons I’m gonna take break from
videos for a while Thanks for
watching and I hope you all have
good lives I’1l see you around

Among the dozen or so pictures is the one for MOST QUIET It
shows a strange boy with his finger to his lips He is
shushing the tiny girl beside him who is hunched over a
book her face barely visible

INT KAYLA’S BEDROOM THAT NIGHT

Kayla lies on her bed lights on on her phone She’s on
Instagram scrolling through her feed

Comments being posted friends tagging each other in
pictures new relationships budding and breaking Kayla looks
but doesn’t participate

KENNEDY GRAVES posted five pictures SUMMER POOL PARTY
Kayla swipes through the mini Everyone is happy and
energetic and having a blast She can’t find herself in any
of the photos

She arrives at the group picture at the diving board She’s
not in it Kayla stares at the photo and then closes her
eyes

BLOOP An Instagram chat from Gabe

From Gabe did you see the photos Kennedy posted

Kayla responds no

Gabe there stupid she didn’t post any of my handstand pics

INT KAYLA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Dad is on the couch browsing his Kindle with reading glasses
on Kayla walks in behind him

KAYLA
Will you help me burn something in
the backyard

DAD

EXT KAYLA’S BACKYARD LATER

Kayla and Dad are sitting next to each other on plastic lawn
chairs around a small fire burning in the patio’s fire-pit

Kayla looks down at the TIME CAPSULE in her lap

Its writing glows by the light of the fire TO THE COOLEST
GIRL IN THE WORLD

DAD
You sure you want to do this

KAYLA
Yes

DAD
I’m not exactly sure what “this”
isor meansI’m just hoping
that whatever we’re doing here is a
positive thing

KAYLA
Yeah

DAD
Alright then

Kayla places the box in the fire pit It starts to burn
Kayla and Dad watch it

DAD (CONTD)
What was in there

KAYLA
Nothing really Justsort of my
hopes and dreams

DAD
wees Rightand you’re burning
them
KAYLA
Yes
DAD
Alright

Dad puts his arm around his daughter and watches the fire
with her As always he’s searching for something - anything -
to say or do to make his daughter happier

And just as he’s about to say something just as he’s about
to make another admirable and kind and probably slightly off-
the-mark attempt at helping the little girl that he loves so
very very much more than anything she speaks

KAYLA
Do I make you sad

DAD
Wh- Sweetheart no No Not at
all Kayla - not at all Do I seem
sad

KAYLA
No

DAD
Then why would you think you make
me sad

KAYLA

I don’t knowSometimes I think
that like when I grow up maybe
Ill have a daughter And then
like I was thinking if she was
like me I think that would make me
really sad all the time Cause I
would love her a lot because she’s
my daughter butI don’t know I
guess if she ended up being like
me I think being her mom would
make me really sad

Kayla stares down at her lap picks at her nails
Dad pauses devastated and then leans in purposefully

sternly and says what may be the only thing that he is
absolutely one hundred thousand percent certain of

DAD
You’re wrong KaylaKayla look
at me
(she does)

You’re wrongIf you grow up to
have a daughter like you she will
make you so so happy Being your
dad makes me so happy Kayla You
don’t know You don’t know how
happy you make me It’s beyond
anything I can’t describe it to
you And it’s not just because
you’re my daughter It’s not
because I’m your dad and I would
love you no matter what It’s
because of you Do you understand
A lot of parents Kayla a lot of
parents have to love their kids in
spite of who they are Not me I
get to love you because of who you
are Do you get that Kayla you
are so good You’re such a good
person

(MORE )

DAD (CONT’D)

I’m not just saying this Kayla
It’s true Kayla look at me Look
at me It’s so easy to love you
It’s so easy to be proud of you I
really mean that And yeah
sometimes when I see you’re upset
or having a rough day it makes me
sad But that being sad that sort
of day-to-day sad stuff or worrying
that I do is it’s -- Kayla I am
always beneath all that stuff
always just so unbelievably happy
that I get to be your dad

(a pause a deep breath a

decision)
-Kayla when your mom left I was
really scared Like really really
scared Because now I was all alone
with this little girl that I loved
so much and wanted everything for
and I wasn’t sure if I could give
you what you needed so I was really
scared I was scared that you
weren’t going to be okay I was
scared just like you are right now
More scared Way moreBut then
you got older And you took your
first steps and you said your
first words and you wrote your
first letter to Nana and you made
your first friend and everything
that I thought I was going to have
to teach you - how to be nice how
to share how to care about other
people’s feelings - you just
started doing on your own Your
teachers would say “you’ve got
such a lovely daughter you’ve done
such a great job with her” But I
didn’t do anything I really
didn’t I just watched And the
more I watched you the less scared
I got I stopped being scared a
long time ago Kayla You know why
Because of you You made me brave
Kayla And if you could just see
yourself like I see youthe way
you really are the way you always
have beenI promise you wouldn’t
be scared either

Kayla scoots out of her chair and onto her dad’s lap She
hugs him tight hugs him in a way that she hasn’t in a very
long time He hugs her back

The fire burns The hug does not break

EXT GABE’S HOUSE NIGHT

Kayla is at the back door of a small house She goes to
knock stops Turns and walks away Stops Turns back to the
house Walks back to the front door Stops Takes a deep
breath and knocks

Kayla walks toward one of the chairs Gabe pulls it out for
her and she sits

GABE

here so tell me if they’re too cold
and I can heat them up in the
microwave

KAYLA
Okay

GABE

Gabe picks up a PIECE OF PAPER that was sitting right beside
Kayla’s plate He stands in front of her holding it

GABE (CONTD)
I didn’t mean to leave this out
Sorry So stupid

KAYLA
No problem

Gabe doesn’t move Holds the paper out to Kayla

poses shoots an imaginary arrow and then takes his seat
opposite Kayla

He grabs his glass of soda and holds it up

Gabe smiles Kayla smiles back

INT GABE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM LATER

Gabe and Kayla sit on the couch “together” (three feet apart
stiff both facing forward nervous)

GABE
--what do you wanna do

KAYLA
Ohwhatever

GABE
Yeah me too I can do whatever

KAYLA
you wanna watch something

GABE
Sure

Gabe grabs the remote off the coffee table in front of them
He hesitates puts the remote back down

GABE (CONTD)
Actuallycan I show you

something
KAYLA
Sure
GABE
Okay

Gabe hops up from the couch and runs out of the room Kayla
stays put sitting up straight knees bouncing nervous

We stay on Kayla as we hear the sounds of Gabe’s frantic
search loud footsteps down a hallway a door opens closes
a pause door opens again more footsteps

GABE (0S) (CONT’D)
(just outside the room)
Okay I’m ready to show you

KAYLA
Okay

GABE
It’s not that cool But maybe
youll think it’s really cool I
don’t know it’s kind of cool I
guess

KAYLA
Okay

GABE
Close your eyes

Kayla does We stay on her as Gabe enters the room Lots of
little strange sounds

GABE (CONTD)
Keep your eyes closed

KAYLA
Okay

GABE
Okay you can open your eyes

Kayla does Gabe is standing in front of her with his hands
behind his back There’s a large cardboard box behind him and
a laptop now open on the coffee table between Kayla and him

GABE (CONTD)
So like I told you about how I do
archery and um like this is sort
of like another one of my passions

Gabe keeps one hand behind his back as the other reaches out
and hits the laptop’s spacebar HEAVY METAL MUSIC begins to
blast as Gabe pulls TWO LARGE SILVER RINGS from behind his
back and begins his magic routine

Gabe’s hands shake with adrenaline as he does his linking
rings routine Then reaches into the box does more tricks -
color changing scarves cutting and melding ropes

The face-melting guitar doesn’t quite match up with Gabe’s

routine But Gabe is taking this very seriously too nervous
to look up at Kayla and see if she’s liking it or not He’s
practiced this a thousand times and this is it his moment

And as Gabe struggles through his act messing up here
dropping a prop there Kayla watches him
Someone is doing something for her
And she is watching it
Smiling
Her world upside-down

The pressure finally for a moment off

EXT STREET GABE’S HOUSE LATER

Dad waits in his car parked on the street in front of Gabe’s
house He stares ahead turns sees something smiles

Kayla enters the car

DAD
Hey

KAYLA
Hey

Dad pulls away and starts driving We stay on the two of
them sitting quietly

A long silence between them then

DAD
Did you have fun

KAYLA
Yeah yeah it was fun

DAD
Good

They drive Both staring forward Sitting in silence

Together

INT MILES GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL - LOBBYHALLWAY MORNING 75
We move slowly through the lobby The floor somehow both
scuffed and shiny A giant trophy case with way too much in
it A high ceiling

And empty

PRINCIPAL MCDANIEL (0S)
Friends Family and Loved Ones

The strange sounds of a speech happening in a large nearby
space Loud and echoing and muffled through the walls Barely
discernible

We continue to move slowly through the lobby and toward an
open hallway entrance

PRINCIPAL MCDANIEL (0S) (CONTD)
Today is a celebration A chance
for us to applaud the achievements
of these amazing kids Miles Grove
Middle School’s Class of 2017

Applause Even louder Even stranger sounding Principal
Mcdaniel’s speech fades to barely audible as we move down the
hallway

It’s dark Something in the distance

We keep moving Get closer

Kids waiting in the dark lined up against the right wall of
the hallway in single file Dressed in caps and gowns

A CHAPERONE (40s) at the front of the line by the entrance to
the Gym The kids are chatting bored not really caring
about whatever they’re supposed to be caring about right now

CHAPERONE
(whisper yelling)
Guys Guys We’re almost there a
few more minutes please please
just guys Shhhh just shhhh
please and thank you

We pass the Chaperone and continue down the line Boy girl
boy girl girl girl boy boy boy girl b--wait

Kayla

Cap too big for her head Swimming in her gown She stands up
straight hands clenched into fists at her side She looks
down the hall sees something

Aiden He’s late hustling toward the back of the line
Looking cute even in that stupid robe

Kayla watches him as he passes Then faces forward Stares

Then makes a decision

She steps out of her place and begins walking quickly down
the line We follow her She moves with confidence and
purpose Aiden’s ahead fixing his cap over his stupid head

Kayla reaches him And passes Keeps walking She finally
stops and turns

Kennedy Graves is standing with Steph and another friend All
on their phones

KAYLA
Hey

Kennedy looks up Too confused to even react
Kayla speaks the following in what seems like one breath

KAYLA (CONTD)
I wrote you that letter thanking
you for having me to your party and
you didn’t write back like not
even a facebook message and that’s
really stupid and mean And being
mean isn’t cool it’s MEAN When
someone does something nice you’re
supposed to do something nice back
I’m always nice to you and you’re
never nice to me and that’s not
fair I’m a good person and you
should be nicer to me

Kennedy looks shockeddisgusted Kayla turns to walk away
whips back

KAYLA (CONTD)

(angrier)
And that card game I got you for
your birthday is actually REALLY
FUN and you’d know that if you
actually PLAYED IT And I know you
probably think it’s stupid but
stupid games can be fun sometimes
like if it’s raining outside or
whatever it’s a great game it’s
like a really fun version of Go
Fish and if you actually just
tried playing it instead of trying
to be cool all the time you’d
realize that it’s really fun game
to play when you’re bored And-

Kayla turns and walks away Back up the line The adrenaline
of the moment still coursing through her She retakes her
spot in line Taking deep breaths to calm herself

She smiles
The familiar sounds of PHOTOBOOTH BEEP BEEP BEEP CLICK

KAYLA (VO)
Hey Kayla it’s me Kayla

The line starts to move Kayla walks with her classmates as
the line funnels from the dark hallway through the bright
door to the gymnasium

KAYLA (VO)
Congrats on finishing high school
I’m so so so so SO proud of
you

INT KAYLA’S BEDROOM LATER THAT DAY

Kayla is sitting at her desk still in her graduation robes
speaking to her laptop’s webcam

KAYLA
It’s crazy to think that you’re
almost 18 You probably look a lot
different than me which is cool
but also if you still sort of look
like this that’s cool too

INT KAYLA’S BEDROOM LATER

CLOSE ON a USB DRIVE KOALA BEAR plugged into Kayla’s laptop
Kayla pulls it out We continue to hear Kayla’s video

KAYLA (VO)
How did you do on the SATs Did you
suck at the math part It’s okay if
you did Math is stupid

Kayla places the Koala Bear into a BRAND NEW SHOEBOX full of
tiny trinkets and keepsakes a picture of Kayla and her dad
a bracelet Aiden’s crazy straw the strip of pictures with
Olivia from the mall photobooth a sauce packet from Gabe’s

KAYLA (VO)
Do you have a boyfriend If you
don’t that’s fine And if you do I
hope he is treating you well You
deserve it

Kayla puts the lid on the shoebox On the lid in freshly
colored marker are the words TO THE COOLEST GIRL IN THE
WORLD

EXT KAYLA’S BACKYARD DAY

Kayla places her new time capsule into a two-foot deep
crudely-dug hole in her backyard - a pile of loose dirt
beside it Dad watches her smiling holding a shovel He
begins shoveling the loose dirt back into the hole

KAYLA (VO)

Is dad still a dork If he’s not
still a dork he’s probably an
alien just wearing dad’s skin as a
disguise and you should kill him
right after you read this

The brightly-colored shoebox disappears more and more with
every shovelful of dirt

INT KAYLA’S BATHROOM NIGHT
Kayla stands in front of the mirror Dressed for something
Hair and makeup done up

KAYLA (VO)

I hope you’re not too sad about
leaving all your friends for
college

Kayla lifts up her phone poses for a selfie

INT DAD’S CAR LATER THAT NIGHT

Kayla rides shotgun Dad drives They are talking about
something making small talk laughing happy

KAYLA (VO)

But if you are sad just remember
that can still stay in touch with
all of your high school friends and
youll make tons of new friends at
your new school next year

INT MILES GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM LATER 81

The END OF THE YEAR DANCE is bumping Sweaty pubescent kids
grind and “dance” with each other Kayla walks in looking
beautiful as always

KAYLA (VO)
And I know you probably don’t want
advice from an eighth grader

Kayla walks into the middle of the large mob of her peers
She starts to dance

KAYLA (VO)
--but I just want you to know that
if high school sucked for you Im
really sorry and that sucked
butits whatever I mean middle
school sucked for me but Im past

She dances harder Arms hips shoulders head All moving

KAYLA (VO)

to you You never know whats going
to happen next and thats what
