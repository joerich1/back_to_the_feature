OVER BLACK

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Previously on 21 Jump Street

Long-haired JENKO watches Slim-Shady SCHMIDT get rejected in
the high school hallway

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
We met two young men who couldn’t
have been more different

JENKO
(to Schmidt)
You’re a fucking nerd

Jenko sits with the PRINCIPAL as she holds up a failed test

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
The other a dumb jock

Jenko sees Schmidt at the police academy

JENKO
Not-so-slim Shady

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
But what kept them apart in high
school would soon bring them
together

Jenko slams Schmidt to his back on the mat

SCHMIDT
You’re good at this huh

JENKO
Yeah I am

Jenko fails his test and Schmidt gets an A

JENKO (CONTD)
Youre really good at this

SCHMIDT
Yeah I am

JENKO
Hey you wanna be friends

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
And against all odds they forged a
friendship

42013 2

They train and become friends and graduate the academy

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
And were sent back to high school
as undercover cops

DICKSON
Teenage the fuck up

They walk across their new high school parking lot

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Wait they’re not supposed to look
like believable high school
students are they They look forty

Jenko sits next to DAX in AP Chemistry

DAX
You look really old

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Exactly God who writes this shit

Schmidt and Jenko approach ERIC

ERIC
You guys aren’t narcs are you

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Of course they’re fucking narcs

Schmidt and Jenko take the drug Jenko dives through the
gong Schmidt holds the racing baton as a penis

ERIC
I can’t sell all this shit on my
own but I only bring in people I
like

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
And narcs Like this idiot could
get into Berkeley My daughter got
a 1480 on her S A T’s and got
wait-listed

Schmidt and Jenko have a car chase with the one-percenters

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Anyway there’s a car chase some
explosions

They chase Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in a water park

FH

42013

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
I have no idea what this part’s

about

SCHMIDT
What’s happening Who are we
chasing

JENKO

I don’t know This feels weird

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Then we get a textbook end of
second act disagreement

Schmidt and Jenko fighting on stage

JENKO
You think I’m stupid you’re stupid

SCHMIDT
Worst best friend ever

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Which gets resolved in about five
seconds

Schmidt and Jenko get dressed in their tuxedoes

SCHMIDT
Will you go to prom with me

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
Yada yada yada more explosions

The limo explodes Jenko takes a bullet for Schmidt

SCHMIDT
You took a bullet for me

JENKO
You’re a goddamn rock star

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
And they get a new assignment

We see Dickson proudly telling them

DICKSON
You two sons of bitches are going
to college

SCHMIDT

Yes
42013 4

JENKO
No

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
(getting serious)
Only one question remains will
their differences bring them to new
heights or tear them apart

CUT TO BLACK

SMOOTH MALE VOICE (VO)
That and who gives a shit I guess
that’s two questions I can’t
believe this is what I do fora
living I went to Julliard
Unfuckingreal I need a drink

INT COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY
A professor stands at a lectern in front of the Yin and Yang

PROFESSOR
In Chinese philosophy the Yin and
Yang demonstrate how seemingly
opposite forces are actually
complementary interacting to form
a whole greater than either
separate part

We slowly PULL BACK from the lectern and into

INT FANCY JUMP STREET HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The professor talks on the screen of a laptop the crest of
the University of Phoenix Online posted above his head

Schmidt and Jenko sit at ergonomic fancy desks watching the
lecture on high end laptops

SCHMIDT
Listening for coded messages in on-
line lectures is not what I had in
mind when Dickson said we were
going to college

JENKO
At least we’re not back in high
school

HF

H
42013 5

SCHMIDT
We should be in a quad right now
playing ultimate frisbee with bi-
curious virgins Eighteen year old
girls literally go to college to
learn how to give blowjobs It’s
like an elective

PROFESSOR
(on the computer)
At the intersection of the sturdy
Oak and the pliant Willow lies
opportunity

Jenko and Schmidt perk up at the coded message Jenko scans
Google maps and finds the intersection of Willow and Oak St

JENKO
Got the location Let’s go

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY
Schmidt and Jenko walk across the lot

JENKO
How come you never went to college
Weren’t you the ValeDeLorean or
something

SCHMIDT
Money My parents blew my tuition
on a time-share in Haiti What
about you I thought you had a
football scholarship

JENKO
They took it away because my act
scores weren’t good enough
Whatever college is stupid

SCHMIDT
Are you nuts College is where you
try new things without being judged
and make huge mistakes with no
repercussions It’s the four years
in between the Abu Ghraib of high
school and the Guantanamo Bay of
the rest of your life

INT UNMARKED SEDAN - DAY

Jenko drives
42013 6

SCHMIDT
Not going to college is pretty much
my biggest regret

JENKO
Forget college We’re exactly the
shit-kicking badasses we wanted to
be when we graduated the academy
What else do we need

SCHMIDT
I don’t know I just always thought
things could be bigger somehow

Schmidt puts HARDCORE RAP on the radio

JENKO
(re the music)
Nuh uh no way

SCHMIDT
You drive my choice

JENKO
No I drive my choice I’m tired
of people thinking I’m a Wafrican
American

Jenko flips the radio to club-style UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ music
SCHMIDT
And I’m tired of people thinking
were auditioning for Magic Mike

Schmidt reaches for the radio and Jenko slaps his hand away

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Don’t slap my hand

JENKO
Don’t touch my radio

Schmidt touches the radio again and Jenko slaps him again A
slap-fight ensues and the car swerves all over the road until
Jenko accidentally BREAKS OFF the RADIO’S FACEPLATE

The two of them stare at the radio as the opening bars of
Total Eclipse Of The Heart comes BLASTING out Turn around

JENKO (CONTD)
Shit This is your fault

SCHMIDT
Was your bear paw knocked it off
42013 7

Turn around

They stop at a traffic light and a pair of young girls look
into the car and giggle at them for listening to this song

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
(mortified)
Unbelievable

JENKO
Seriously So embarrassing

A long beat They eye each other and shake their heads Then

SCHMIDT
(singing with gusto)
Turn around bright eyes

JENKO
(equally fierce)
Every now and then I fall apart

SCHMIDT
Turn around bright eyes

JENKO
Every now and then I fall apart

Schmidt kicks in with the heavy air drums
SCHMIDT AND JENKO TOGETHER
And I need you now tonight And I
need you more than ever And if you
only hold me tight we’ll be
holding on forever
EXT UNMARKED SEDAN
The car drives off down the road Schmidt and Jenko belting

Bonnie Tyler with reckless abandon

INT UNMARKED SEDAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Jenko kills the engine at the corner of Willow and Poplar
SCHMIDT
Look
They watch as a massive 18-Wheeler stops outside a warehouse

The driver has a shock of white hair and Schmidt gasps
42013 8

SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
That’s The Ghost
(off Jenko’s look)
Marco Gostino He’s the biggest
trafficker in the country What the
hell are we supposed to be buying

JENKO
Don’t know All the informant said
was there’d be a message in the
lecture where to make the exchange

The GHOST and a SCARFACE thug leap out and open the back

SCHMIDT
Grab the bag and follow my lead

Jenko grins and grabs the duffel bag

EXT CORNER OF WILLOW AND POPLAR - DAY
They walk over The Ghost and Scarface clock their approach

SCHMIDT
(to The Ghost)
Let’s make this quick You got the
stuff

GHOST
Youre Achmed El-Sayed

Schmidt freezes then turns to Jenko

SCHMIDT
(with conviction)
Yalla assalam alaykum Omar Sharif

JENKO
Huh

SCHMIDT
(to The Ghost)
My partner wants to see the goods

GHOST
(beat)
You have the money

SCHMIDT
Let’s see the goods first

The Ghost eyes them and POPS a SWITCHBLADE A beat then he
turns it handle-first and hands it to Schmidt
42013 9

Schmidt attempts to jump inside but gets stuck halfway Jenko
gives him a boost and leaps in after They cut open a box

JENKO
(whispering)
What is it Guns Drugs

Schmidt lifts the lid of the box and a giant PARROT flies out
and pecks the side of his face

SCHMIDT
OH GOD

Feathers fly as it ruthlessly pecks at Schmidt’s face

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
GET IT OFF ME IT’S EATING MY FACE

Jenko smacks it off Schmidt and it flies out of the truck

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
(gathering himself)
Exotic birds As we expected

(to Jenko)
Yalla yalla pay the man

Jenko’s hand moves to the gun tucked beneath his shirt when
we hear the BLIP from a police siren

They all look up to see a police car pull up behind them
JOSH a fat curly-haired cop emerges from the car

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
(seeing the cop’s face)
Oh fuck my asshole

JOSH
You guys are blocking the alley
I’m gonna have to-- Oh my stars is
that who I think it is

SCHMIDT
Uh hey cop sir we’re all set

JOSH
Sir Don’t you recognize me It’s
Josh from Hebrew school

SCHMIDT
This really isn’t a good time

JOSH
What are you doing in this truck I
thought you were a cop

42013 10

SCHMIDT
What Me You’re confused

JOSH
No no it’s why I went to the
academy I figured if Schmidty--

GHOST
I thought you were El-Sayed
SCHMIDT
El-Sayed-Schmidt I triple-

barrelled

The Ghost eyes Schmidt Jenko Josh and then Scarface and in
a flash GUNS are drawn by everyone except Josh

Shots are fired as The Ghost and Scarface race into the cab
and start the truck Schmidt and Jenko still in the back

The truck takes off down the block as Josh heads back to his
patrol car and radios in for back up

The 18-Wheeler SCREAMS down narrow streets crushing cars as
it goes In back Schmidt is tossed like a rag doll
SPLINTERING boxes and freeing Macaws Parakeets and Canaries

Jenko stands rock solid somehow unaffected

JENKO
Okay Follow my lead

Jenko takes an acrobatic jump off a box to his right a
heroic leap to a higher box to his left and then
miraculously whips himself onto the roof

Schmidt gathers himself and copies Jenko’s move exactly

Except he flubs it missing the second box and snagging
himself on some netting attached to the back of the truck

Jenko hoists Schmidt up netting and all The truck swerves
flinging Schmidt off the roof but the netting ensnares
Jenko’s leg and Schmidt is held aloft They’re tied together

JENKO (CONTD)
What are you doing

SCHMIDT
Not dying

JENKO
Get up here

42013 11

SCHMIDT
I’m trying

Despite being occasionally thrown off balance by the anchor-
like Schmidt Jenko strides forward and leaps onto the hood
and starts PUNCHING a hole in the windshield

SCARFACE
He’s like the fucking Terminator

Dozens of cop cars join the chase exotic birds fill the sky

Jenko grabs The Ghost through the hole in the windshield and
the truck crashes into a tree sending Schmidt flying Still
tied together Schmidt rips Jenko off the hood as well

The Ghost and Scarface run off leaving Schmidt and Jenko
behind as two dozen uniformed cops rush forward and aim their
guns at them unaware that they’re cops

INT POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Schmidt and Jenko sit in front of Hardy who simply stares at
the dozen POCK MARKS covering half of Schmidt’s face

SCHMIDT
It’s where the bird attacked me I
can turn this way if it helps

HARDY
Nobody gave a shit about the Jump
Street re-boot when you first came
on Anyone with half a brain
thought it was destined to fail
spectacularly But you got lucky
so the Commissioner re-re-booted
Jump Street and increased the
budget and got you that fancy
office across the street As if
spending twice the money guaranteed
twice the profit

JENKO
Makes sense to me

HARDY
Like it made sense to you to wreck
half the city playing free bird
(off Schmidts chuckle)
And it made sense to you to dangle
from a net while The Ghost escaped

e HH HF

HH
42013

JENKO
(defending Schmidt)
Hey he’s the only reason we knew
it was The Ghost we didn’t catch
Did you know he speaks Arabic

HARDY
Did you know the Commissioner is
blaming me for allowing you to be
put on a different assignment
She’s convinced the reason this
debacle happened is you weren’t
doing the exact same thing you did
the first time She thinks doing
the same thing will make you
recapture the old chemistry and
somehow stop your egos from ruining
the whole enterprise She doesn’t
get that it’s always worse the
second time around After the buzz
of the initial success wears off
all the tiny differences you
thought were cute and endearing
becoming irritating and offputting
You begin to wonder is my partner
holding me back Can I function on
my own One person pulls away The
other gets possessive It’s a slow
painful unraveling until one day
one of you finds yourself alone
behind a desk while the other is
the biggest recording artist in the
free world

HARDY (CONTD)
But hey I don’t make the decisions
around here and the Commissioner
is adamant that if you guys just do
the same thing everyone will be
happy But mark my words screw
this one up and youll be back
riding bikes around the duck pond

EXT JUMP STREET HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Schmidt and Jenko stand looking at 21 Jump Street

SCHMIDT
The new office is swank and all
but I kind of miss the old church

We see a framed photo on Hardy’s desk of Hardy and Celine
Dion performing on stage in gold-sequined pantsuits

HF

HH
42013 13

They turn and head across the street to 22 Jump Street

INT DICKSON’S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Schmidt and Jenko sit with Dickson in his new and improved
office Multiple flat screens surround his ergonomic desk

Dickson tosses them each a folder

DICKSON
They want the same shit well here

assignment

JENKO
We’re going back to high school

DICKSON
Manimal you’re 40

JENKO
Thirty-two

DICKSON
You going to MC State

SCHMIDT
We’re going to college For real

DICKSON
Someone’s cooking a new drug its
a chemical combination of Adderall
and Ecstasy Kids take it and get
laser focus for four hours of
studying then get high as fuck for
four hours

Jenko looks at the name of the drug in the folder WhyPhy

JENKO
Wipey

DICKSON
Why-Phy Stands for Work Hard Yes
Play Hard Yes

Dickson taps the screen and nothing happens He taps a again

DICKSON (CONTD)
God damn piece of shit

SCHMIDT
It’s not a touch screen
42013 14

Dickson tries to use the Magic Trackpad but he moves the
entire device accomplishing nothing

SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Let me

Schmidt starts a video of a young black girl maniacally
flinging paint at a pair of canvases shaped like wings

JENKO
Whoa she’s wasted

DICKSON
That’s her focused shitbrain

The clip transitions to cell-phone footage of the same girl
standing in a bikini on the roof of a fraternity

GIRL
I am the Nubian goddess of love

The crowd roars with approval

SCHMIDT
She’s awesome
(beat realizing)
She’s not gonna end up dead is sh--

The girl leaps from the roof and the camera catches half her
fall before shifting to the grass We hear gasps of horror

DICKSON
Her name was Cynthia Watson

Dickson slides across a picture from a security camera of the
girl receiving a packet of pills from someone in a car

DICKSON (CONTD)
That’s the dealer You can’t see
his face but look at the tattoo

Dickson puts two fingers on the screen and pulls them apart

SCHMIDT
It’s still not a touch screen

Schmidt leans over and zooms in on the picture The arm
reaching from the car has a hideous tattoo of a guy shooting
missiles out of his arm as he drives a convertible

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
That’s a very specific mythology
42013

DICKSON
Find the dealer Find the supplier

SCHMIDT
I just wanna say it’s refreshing
to get a case with a black victim

DICKSON
Refreshing

SCHMIDT
I’m just saying we care just as
much as if she was white

JENKO
It’s a tie how much we care

DICKSON
We need to make sure the drug
doesn’t leave that campus It’s
exactly the same as high school

SCHMIDT
Not exactly the same These girls
are of age so we can--

DICKSON
Be gentlemen I’m not gonna be
responsible for sicking two old-ass
predators on someone’s daughter

SCHMIDT
Technically everyone is someone’s
daughter Sasha Grey is someone’s
daughter

Dickson SLAPS the desk

DICKSON
Just infiltrate the dealer and find
the supplier

JENKO
I still think going right to the
supplier is a possibility

Dickson SLAPS the desk again
DICKSON

Infiltrate the dealer find the
supplier

42013 16

INT KOREAN CHURCH - DAY

Schmidt walks into the church which is now filled with old
Korean men and women praying in Korean

SCHMIDT
Hey guys You mind if I

A Korean woman smiles and says something to him in Korean as
she gestures him over to Korean Jesus

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
So you guys don’t mind

No one pays him any attention

SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Hey Korean Jesus Long time no
pray How’ve you been Busy
probably North Korea Nuts right
So listen with this whole college
thing I was hoping while I’m there
I could take care of this thing I
never got a chance to take care of
which is um having sex Like with
another person I know it’s weird
to ask you not because you’re
Korean I assume Koreans do plenty
of sex having but because you’re
Jesus and I’m pretty sure you died
a virgin and that’s cool for you
I just I just really don’t want to
die a virgin Anything you can do
Amen Don’t tell anyone Thanks

JENKO (0OS)
Yo let’s go
Schmidt turns to see Jenko at the front of the church He
heads over to him and as he goes elderly Koreans all start
saying Virgin Virgin Virgin

JENKO (CONTD)

exploding with excited college kids and anxious parents

INT HALLWAY - DORMITORY - DAY

Jenko Schmidt and his parents carry boxes and bags as a

DORM ROOM MONTAGE

Schmidt and Jenko set up their room arguing over everything

SCHMIDT
I call this bed

JENKO

42013 19

Jenko refers to the dresser right next to Schmidt’s bed

SCHMIDT
The dresser goes with the bed

JENKO
Says who

They set up appliances Jenko puts a microwave on his desk

JENKO (CONTD)
It wasn’t on the list but I
remembered last second

Schmidt eyes Jenko then unpacks a microwave twice as big

JENKO (CONTD)
I think you’re overcompensating

SCHMIDT
It wasn’t on your list because it
was on my list That’s the point of
the lists

JENKO
(beat thinking)
Well put the little one inside the
big one and cook things twice as
fast

Schmidt tries to move the mini-fridge then nearly topples
over backwards until Jenko helps him with a roll of his eyes

Schmidt’s hangs up posters of women and beer Jenko’s are
kitten hang-in-there posters There’s no room to put them all
up so they keep trying to put their’s on top of the other’s

SCHMIDT
Stop

JENKO
You stop

Two identical Asian hipsters appear in their door ALAN and
MIKE YANG one in lenseless glasses one in a keffiyeh

ALAN YANG
Hey guys We’re your suite mates
The Yangs

MIKE YANG

42013 20

MONTAGE of Schmidt and Jenko doing different activities

QUAD - Schmidt makes balloon animals and high fives peoples’
tattoo-less arms as their balloons fizzle out

LECTURE HALL - Jenko stands at a podium opposite a student
arguing at a speed almost beyond comprehension

MODERATOR
(to Jenko)
You have four minutes for rebuttal

JENKO
Yeah Well What he said

Jenko high fives the confused genius’ tattoo-less arm
DORM ROOM - Schmidt and Jenko cross two clubs off their list

PROFESSOR’S HOUSE - Schmidt talks to KEN handsome and
MERCEDES a goody-two-shoes who looks like Rebel Wilson

MERCEDES
This is the greatest country in the
world but you have to be a self-
starter If theres one thing I
learned from my dad it’s that weak
people wait for opportunities
strong people make them

SCHMIDT
Up top for ingenuity

Schmidt gives Ken an awkward high five no tattoo
STUDENT CENTER - Jenko plays boggle Everyone furiously
writes down words Jenko’s list says FOOT FOOTS and SFOOT
Jenko eyes the other players’ tattoo-less arms

JENKO
Shit College is harder than high
school

CAFE - Schmidt listens to a woman’s angry slam poem about her
vagina Schmidt eyes the other students’ arms until he’s
forcibly dragged to the stage After an awkward beat

SCHMIDT
Slam Poetry Yelling Angry Why
am I here For arms To disarm you
To undress you With my eyes And
also my hands I’m not who I say I
am but I am who I will always be
Your clothes give them to me

To Schmidts surprise people start applauding

FOOTBALL FIELD - Jenko stand in walk-on jerseys with a few
dozen other hopefuls all shorter and narrower than Jenko

A haggard old COACH stands next to a bored-looking chained up
bear - the mascot - and blows a whistle On the field the
properly uniformed players demolish a crew of walk-ons

The coach blows the whistle again and Jenko takes his place
at outside linebacker as the starters chuckle to each other

ROOSTER
God I love walk-on day

Recognizing Rooster as the guy who made fun of him in class
Jenko’s eyes narrow Zook the quarterback turns and grins at
Rooster

ZOOK
Watch out Rooster Looks like
someone has a crush on you

The ball is snapped and in a flash Jenko chucks his block
and races through the line as Zook hands the ball to Rooster

JENKO POV

SLO-MO as Jenko enters the JOCK ZONE Everything goes to
black but his target Rooster and we zip to full speed and
Jenko slams his shoulder-pad into Rooster’s chest

BACK TO SCENE

Jenko rises staring down at Rooster who rolls over grass
in his face-mask

JENKO
Happy Halloween motherfucker

Zook cracks up loving Jenko’s attitude and Jenko helps
Rooster up looking for the tattoo but a cast covers his arm

INT JUMP STREET HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

Schmidt and Jenko stand at the bulletin board we saw in the
first movie that had yarn connecting pictures of suspects

done it it won’t be awkward

puts his hands up and nods his head towards Schmidt

SCHMIDT (CONT’D)

an art major

DICKSON
Art major No wonder
(lowering his gun)
But I was asking about the case

SCHMIDT
We found the dealer

JENKO

JENKO

doesn’t seem like the guy

SCHMIDT
We went over this last night He’s
got the tattoo and he was talking
about a pickup he made It’s him
42013

JENKO
You tried to get him to deal to you
and he wouldn’t do it

SCHMIDT
That’s how good he is

SCHMIDT
Hey KJ You granted my wish and

complain but the way you did it
was a little monkeys pawish so
maybe I could do it again and
remember it this time That cool
Because having gotten laid and
pretending to remember isn’t much
better than remembering to pretend
to have gotten laid

Schmidt turns and walks out of the church On the way an

ancient Korean lady tugs at his sleeve
ANCIENT KOREAN LADY

JENKO

of drugs and you’d say it was just
an attic

JENKO
Fuck you If he’s the guy he’s the

SCHMIDT
Holy shit

Jenko looks and sees what Schmidt sees a black ski mask and
gloves and beside that the gift-wrapped package

SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Thats the package Zook snuck
upstairs during the party

Schmidt reaches for it just as they hear someone OPENING the
LOCKED attic door

JENKO
Fuck

The attic door opens as Zook pushes Schmidt out of the attic
window and together they tumble out onto the roof

Zook steps in and eyes the open attic window with suspicion

EXT FRATERNITY ROW

Schmidt and Jenko jump onto the back of the Yang’s scooters

JENKO
Would you stop insulating that I’m
too close to Zook
(beat)
You don’t think they saw us do you

SCHMIDT
No

As he says it POTATO SACKS are thrown over their HEADS and
their wrists and ankles are wrapped in heavy-duty duct-tape

A car ZIPS forward and they’re both thrown into the trunk

The car stops and we hear people jump out Footsteps head
towards the trunk

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Oh God this is it

We hear an audible SQUIRT

JENKO
What the hell was that

SCHMIDT
I just pooped a little

JENKO

The trunk flies open and their hoods are ripped off

Schmidt and Jenko look up to see Zook holding the gun with
Rooster and two other brothers looking deadly serious

ZOOK
You already know don’t you

SCHMIDT
No I don’t know anything

ZOOK
Even better
42013 54

Zook points the gun at Schmidt and pulls the trigger A
stream of liquid hits Schmidt in the face

SCHMIDT
Is that Smirnoff

ZOOK
Welcome to Zeta pledges

Rooster steps up and shoots a fire-extinguisher into the

trunk and two others shake beers and douse Jenko and Schmidt

Slowly the foam and spray peters out and the brothers all
stare into the trunk noses crinkled

ROOSTER

Schmidt reaches out and holds Maya’s hand under the table

PROFESSOR (CONTD)
Once an anchor is set other
judgments are made by adjusting
away from that anchor and there is
a bias toward interpreting other
information around the anchor

We see Schmidt at the fraternity eyeing the attic door
which now has a second lock

We
as

We
to

see Jenko and Zook in class listening to PROFESSOR JACOBS
he reads a quote from Theodore Roosevelt

PROFESSOR JACOBS
It is not the critic who counts
but the man in the arena whose
face is marred by dust and sweat
and blood

see Jenko processing the words which continue as we cut
him and Zook playing football

PROFESSOR JACOBS (VO)
There is no effort without error
but who does actually strive to do
the deeds knows in the end the
triumph of high achievement and if
he fails at least fails while
daring greatly

Jenko gets run over his face full of dirt and Zook rushes
over and helps him up as Schmidt watches from the bleachers

PROFESSOR JACOBS
So that his place shall never be
with those cold and timid souls who
neither know victory nor defeat

We see Maya watching Schmidt on stage at Slam Poetry

SCHMIDT
The fire rages inside me Burning
Yearning Unquenched Entrenched
If a rose bush falls in the forest
but no one is there to see it does
it still have its flowers

We see Schmidt and Maya leaving the Slam Poetry coffee shop

Sorry Mercedes couldn’t make it

wind Mercedes closes one notepad and opens a LARGER one

far he goes full Atlas Hoisting the world above his head

After a beat Schmidt glances down at Mercedes

ZOOK
Listen you shouldn’t do that
stuff It’s dangerous

JENKO
Oh I don’t want to I was just
wondering if maybe dealing was a
way to make some extra cash I
wouldnt normally but college is
expensive and I could see how
someone who is generally a good guy
might be sucked into doing
something he wouldnt ordinarily
do Know what I mean

Jenko gets a TEXT from Schmidt - Meet me at Health Center

Mercedes hikes up her skirt to reveal black garters and a
pair of leather panties with zippers in front and back
42013 62

JENKO

Someone tries the locked door

MAN (0S)

JENKO

Schmidt is silent for a beat

SCHMIDT
This is all my fault We were happy

DR MURPHY

EXT CAMPUS - NIGHT
Schmidt and Jenko tail Zook across campus following him to
the back of the library In the light they see he’s carrying

the wrapped up package we saw in the attic in his hand

SCHMIDT
I told you he was the dealer

Zook looks around to see if anyone sees him then lifts open
a window with a broken latch and climbs inside
INT LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

Schmidt tumbles in through the window landing with a SMACK
in the closed library dimly lit by emergency exit signs

JENKO
Shhh
INT STACKS - LIBRARY

Schmidt and Jenko track Zook to the pitch black stacks As
Zook moves motion-sensored lights click on and off

They move to follow but set off the lights and stop
42013 72

JENKO
(whispering)
Slow

SCHMIDT
If we go too slow we’l1l lose him

JENKO
(irritated)
I know what I’m doing

They reach a corner where they see Zook talking to someone
half-hidden on the other side of the stacks

SCHMIDT
Who’s he talking to

Schmidt leans on a magazine rack straining to see

JENKO
Stay back

Jenko pushes Schmidt back and Schmidt knocks over the
opposite rack making a huge racket and activating the light

Zook and whoever he’s with hear the noise see the light and
RUN in different directions

JENKO (CONTD)
Shit

Jenko jumps over the rack and takes off after the other
person as Schmidt scrambles to his feet only to slip again

By the time Schmidt gets up there are shifting two sets of
lights popping on and off Schmidt picks one and pursues

The lights pop on to reveal people hidden amongst the stacks
Jenko turns a corner and PASSES A YOUNG COUPLE MAKING OUT

JENKO (CONTD)
Sorry Nice work buddy

Schmidt heads down another row the lights pop on and he sees
a guy in a track suit masturbating to National Geographic

SCHMIDT
(as he runs by)
You should check out the internet

Schmidt tracks the direction of the lights and doubles back
42013 73

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
There are a couple great sites I
could recommend

On Jenko as he keeps barely missing the guy he’s chasing

Back to Schmidt as the progression of activating motion
detectors heads right at him he waits then runs forward and
COLLIDES HEAD ON with Jenko who sends Schmidt flying

Schmidt rolls around moaning in pain as Jenko searches for
activating lights but there is only darkness

JENKO
Damnit

Jenko turns to scream at Schmidt for being an idiot and sees

The PACKAGE Zook brought into the library lying abandoned in
his panicked flight from detection

Schmidt and Jenko eye each other taking in the moment then
Schmidt grabs it and rips open the packaging to reveal

A DILDO A big pink veiny dildo

SCHMIDT
What the fuck

JENKO
It’s a dildo

SCHMIDT
I see it’s a dildo I just don’t
know why it’s a dildo

They both stare at it a beat

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Maybe it’s the raw chemical of the
drug in the shape of a dildo He
said if someone saw it they
wouldn’t know what they were
looking at

JENKO
I’m looking at a dildo

SCHMIDT
Exactly
(he smells it)

Schmidt and Jenko eye each other

DICKSON (CONTD)
Well it occurred to me

Dickson touches a flat-screen TV

SCHMIDT

DICKSON
Unfortunately the front door camera
was broken so we didn’t get the
supplier on their way out But we
did get the one from the stacks

SCHMIDT
Oh shit

Dickson gets it started and the TV shows audio-less video of
Schmidt holding the dildo alone because of the angle

Schmidt puts the dildo to his mouth and licks it

BURNS
What the fuck

SCHMIDT
Jenko was doing it too

Jenko shakes his head no way as Schmidt waves the dildo
around then puts the dildo in his mouth and nibbles on it

Whoa Watch the teeth

SCHMIDT
That’s evidence

EXT QUAD - NIGHT

Schmidt and Maya sit on a bench

MAYA
I’m so sorry about my dad

SCHMIDT
Don’t apologize

MAYA
He never used to be like that My
mom says it’s his job She says I
should never ever date a cop

Schmidt squirms

MAYA (CONT’D)
Look I need to tell you something
and there’s no easy way to say it

SCHMIDT
Are you gonna dump me

MAYA
What No
(beat)
Remember the night we slept
together

SCHMIDT
Of course I’1l never forget not
remembering it

MAYA
Well when we got back to my room
you were really drunk

FLASHBACK TO

Maya leads a stumbling Schmidt into the room

MAYA
Oh thank God she’s not here

42013 82

SCHMIDT

MAYA
Your mom

SCHMIDT

Schmidt collapses backwards onto the bed So drunk

MAYA
I’m taking your shoes off

SCHMIDT
Youre taking your top off

MAYA
Something like that

SCHMIDT
Wait wait before we do anything
I have something to show you

Schmidt pulls a handful of condoms out of his pocket

MAYA
Whoa You are one presumptuous
freshman

He tears open a condom wrapper

SCHMIDT
Watch Watch

Maya squints grossed out at that he’s about to pull his
pants down but instead he puts the condom in his mouth and
BLOWS up a condom BALLOON ANIMAL Which leaks

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Shit Sss‘hole

He blows up another it leaks too He looks in his pocker
SCHMIDT (CONTD)
I just learned something Never

keep your condoms in the same
pocket as your thumb tacks

Maya laughs at him

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
I don’t think we can use these
42013 83

MAYA
(mocking him)
Oh no Guess we’ll just have to
raw dog it

SCHMIDT
What We’re gonna make a baby Les

Schmidt passes out and Maya stares at him stunned

END FLASHBACK

EXT QUAD - NIGHT
Schmidt looks at Maya in shock

SCHMIDT
We never did it

Maya shakes her head

MAYA
Talk to me Are you mad Hurt

SCHMIDT
Why would you do that to me

MAYA
I don’t know I was upset that
you had all those condoms like
just because we had fun together at
a party it just entitled you to
have sex with me It’s like women
have completely lost the battle of
the sexes The way I dress the way
I talk it’s all absurdly
oversexualized just so I can get
guys attention And I’m sorry I
lied and I’m sorry it took me this
long to tell you the truth but I
was having so much fun being with
you and taking things slow and
actually having a little romance

SCHMIDT
But you could have had all that
anyway Why did you have to lie

ee e HF HF HF HF HH

42013 84

MAYA
Because I was afraid if I told you
the truth you’d think I was a
prude Because the truth is I’ve
never slept with anyone

Schmidt stares at her dumbfounded

SCHMIDT
Wow

Over Maya’s shoulder Schmidt sees ZOOK walking across the
quad with another package in his hand

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Fuck Maya I gotta go

MAYA
You what Are you kidding After
what I just told you

SCHMIDT
I’m sorry I just I have to

MAYA
If you walk away right now you’1l
basically confirm every darkest
fear I’ve ever had about men
SCHMIDT
(flustered no choice)
I’m sorry

Schmidt walks away after Zook

EXT CHEMISTRY BUILDING - DAY

Schmidt waits across the lawn hidden behind some bushes
There’s a rustling noise and Jenko arrives

JENKO
This better be good

SCHMIDT
Zook went inside with another
package

This is stupid He’s not the guy

SCHMIDT
Yes he is He thought nobody was
watching and he made his move

INT CHEM LAB

Schmidt and Jenko step in and flick on the light to reveal
MERCEDES straddling ZOOK on top of a smooth black countertop

SCHMIDT
AhaoOHMYGOD

ZOOK
Dude what the fuck

Mercedes rolls off Zook and pulls down her skirt

JENKO
I thought you had a girlfriend

ZOOK
I did But I dumped her She was
great and all but Mercedes does
things she could never do

MERCEDES
I have a very particular set of
skills

SCHMIDT

What are you doing here

ZOOK
Mercedes thinks it’s hotter to do
it in crazy places We did it ona
pile of food court fish sticks
once What are you guys doing here

Schmidt eyes the chemistry glassware

SCHMIDT
We’re having a beaker party

JENKO
We needed beakers

Jenko grabs a pair of glass jars called Erlenmeyer flasks

MERCEDES
Those are Erlenmeyers

HF

JENKO
We’1ll bring ‘em back

ZOOK
Whatever Just don’t get too drunk
That guy I was telling you about is
a college scout and he’s gonna be
at practice tomorrow

SCHMIDT
He’s what

ZOOK
He got me a scholarship to USC He
said he could get you one too So

SCHMIDT
(eyeing Zook’s hand)

Zook pulls his hand out to reveal a PINK DILDO
Schmidt gags
ZOOK

Schmidt double gags

SCHMIDT
Oh Oh god

It was three days ago

SCHMIDT
I don’t care

CUT TO

JENKO
Stop

Schmidt stops and they lean against the walls of the stall

SCHMIDT
You were right the whole time The
mask was for pledge night The
package was to get laid His big
hookup is actually a scout
Everything we thought we knew was
wrong

Schmidt shakes his head then it hits him

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Anchoring It’s fucking anchoring
(off Jenko’s confusion)
Mercedes said Cynthia got what was
coming to her And Zook stopped
doing WhyPhy after Cynthia died

JENKO
That’s right

SCHMIDT
The picture isn’t what it seems

JENKO

How could a picture not be what it

seems Its a picture

FLASHBACK TO
DICKSON’S OFFICE - Where Dickson shows them the photograph
DICKSON
(pointing at the tattoo)
That’s the dealer

WE ZOOM IN on the PHOTOGRAPH and suddenly it comes to life

EXT FOOTBALL STADIUM

Both Zook and Cynthia’s hands are on the pack of pills but
as the action rolls it’s Cynthia handing the drugs to Zook

CYNTHIA
Have fun buddy

ZOOK
Thanks Cyn

BACK TO PRESENT

INT DICKSON’S OFFICE - DAY

Schmidt and Jenko pause the security tape for a stunned

Dickson

DICKSON

So Cynthia was the dealer

(they nod)
And she’s dead

(they nod again)
How the fuck you supposed to
infiltrate the dealer if she’s
dead

SCHMIDT
Exactly

DICKSON
How did you figure this all out

SCHMIDT
College We’re supposed to question
everything but we took for granted
that the dealer had the tattoo
because you said so It’s called
Anchoring It’s when you rely too
heavily on the first piece of
information you hear Like when
Maya said we had sex but we
actually never did

DICKSON
Wait what

SCHMIDT
It’s a long story

DICKSON
Oh my God Oh my God It’s like I
can breath again
(he leaps up)
I have to thank Korean Jesus

Dickson leaves

JENKO
What do we do

ee HH

eee HF HF
42013

SCHMIDT
We go straight to the supplier

JENKO
But Dickson said--

SCHMIDT

Fuck what Dickson said And fuck
doing the same thing We’re in
uncharted territory now We have to
do the one thing we’ve never really
done before

(beat)
Police work

JENKO
But we’re no good at police work
We’re good at looking marginally
younger than our real age

SCHMIDT
Jenk its Logic 101 Our problem
was we were using inductive
reasoning off the faulty premise
that Zook was the dealer We need
to use deductive reasoning

INT DORM ROOM - DAY

SCHMIDT

Forget IDing the supplier
directly Whoever it is has to make
the stuff somewhere We find where
he cooks we find the supplier

(pointing at the map)
Theres the chem lab the dining
hall fraternity kitchens There
are ten thousand students but only
a hundred or so places to cook the
drug We can check most of them

JENKO
There’s not enough time

SCHMIDT
We gotta try Jenk please Just
give me a few more days and we’ll
find them I know it

Schmidt looks at Jenko for a long beat then steels himself

Schmidt continues as we see them spread out a map of campus

42013 90

Jenko nods reluctantly
MONTAGE

We see Schmidt and Jenko checking the possible cook sites on
the campus finding nothing then crossing them off the map

We see Jenko in class getting back a test from Professor
Jacobs Professor Jacobs has written “Much better Mr
McQuaid” above a grade of Bt

Schmidt calls Maya as he checks another kitchen but she
doesn’t answer

We see Schmidt and Jenko realizing they’re not making fast
enough progress through the list of kitchens

We see Jenko at a football game making HUGE hits
We see a frustrated Schmidt in Astronomy class

PROFESSOR
How do astronomers detect black
holes if they’re unable to see
them They dont What they detect
are visible phenomena that can only
be explained by the existence of a
nearby black hole To see the
unseeable you must look for
something visible that proves the
presence of the invisible

Schmidt cocks his head

SCHMIDT
Holy shit

INT LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Jenko sits in his uniform at halftime Zook walks over with
the SCOUT

ZOOK
Brad this is that scout I was
telling you about

SCOUT
Youre quite the player son I
just spoke with the coach at USC
Told him I liked what I was seeing
42013 91

Can you imagine you and me in So
Cal kicking ass at the Rose Bowl

SCOUT
(to Jenko)
You put together another half like
the one I just saw it’s nota

INT HEATING AND COOLING FACILITIES - SAME TIME
Schmidt stands with a maintenance worker scrolling through

data on a computer monitor Schmidt suddenly points at
something on the screen

Jenko gets TEXT from Schmidt - Breakthrough NEED YOU NOW

JENKO

JENKO

Jenko races out of the locker room still in his uniform
ZOOK (CONTD)
He’s killing you Cut the cord
INT BACK ROOM - PHARMACY - STUDENT HEALTH CENTER - DAY

Schmidt eyes a bunch of idle burners as Jenko click-clacks
up to him still wearing his cleats

JENKO
What’s so fucking important you had
to pull me out of a game
42013 92

SCHMIDT
We were never going to find
anything because whoevers making
the drug cleans up the evidence
It’s invisible We needed to look
for what they cant clean up I
checked the campus gas usage and
this was the one place that had the
type of off-hour usage spikes that
only make sense if this where they
cooked the drug

The doorknob on the door to the room turns and Schmidt and
Jenko duck out of sight as someone comes into the room

It’s The Ghost and a quartet of thugs

JENKO
(whispering)
What the hell is he doing here

SCHMIDT
(whispering)
He’s a distributor The supplier
must be taking the drug off campus
Whoever it is theyre about to
walk through that door Were about
to solve this shit

Jenko’s phone gets a loud TEXT from Zook - Where are you
The Ghost and his goons look over in their direction

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Shut it off

Jenko gets another TEXT - Maybe you’re not the guy I thought
you were

The Ghost gestures for his goons to check it out and two
armed thugs walk over to where Schmidt and Jenko are hiding

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
(to the thugs)
Do you mind You’re interrupting a
rather stellar blowjob

THE GHOST
What is it

GOON 1
Just a couple of faggots

42013 93

The Ghost rolls his eyes and motions the goons to head back
but Jenko stands up

JENKO
What did you call us
SCHMIDT
(to Jenko)

What are you doing

GOON 1
He said you were sucking his dick

JENKO
It’s 2013 asshole The F word is
completely unacceptable Gay
homosexual possibly queer but it
depends who’s talking

SCHMIDT
Stop it

THE GHOST
What the hell is going on over
there

GOON 2

The gay boys are fighting

JENKO
Stop defining people by their
sexuality If I wanna suck his dick
I’1l suck his dick and that’s none
of your god damn business

SCHMIDT
Ignore him He took one course on
sexual identity and now he thinks
he’s Harvey Milk

JENKO
Jesus could you just once be a
man and have my back

SCHMIDT
Would you just once use your head

JENKO
Want me to use my head Watch this

Jenko head butts one of the goons with his helmet The goon
drops to the floor and Jenko takes off his helmet
42013 94

JENKO (CONTD)
(to The Ghost)
Remember me I’m the fucking
Terminator

THE GHOST
You’re cops

JENKO
That’s right and you’re all under
arrest

THE GHOST
Do you have guns

JENKO
What No

THE GHOST
Cause I have guns

JENKO
Why don’t you put ‘em down and
fight me like a man

THE GHOST
Because I have guns Kill them

The goon by Schmidt and Jenko reaches for his gun but Schmidt
kicks him in the balls and he and Jenko take off running
EXT STUDENT HEALTH CENTER

Schmidt and Jenko race out of the building followed by The
Ghost and his henchman

Jenko pulls Schmidt into an idling Campus Security Smart Car
CAMPUS SECURITY
Hey
INT SMART CAR
Jenko starts the engine and slips the car into drive
CAR CHASE
But before they get anywhere a MASSIVE HUMMER roars towards

them and Schmidt pulls Jenko out of the car just as it’s
PANCAKED beneath the 6000 pound Hummer

42013 95

Schmidt and Jenko run off through the maze-like paths the
Hummer giving chase behind them As they run they argue

SCHMIDT
Why the fuck did you do that

JENKO
I’m sorry but I have a problem
with homophones

SCHMIDT
We were about to catch the supplier
and you fucked it up

JENKO
If you don’t say something people
will never stop discriminating

They round the corner of a building and spy an idling ATV
used by the campus gardening crew

They hop into the ATV and Schmidt guns the engine
CAR CHASE

NO Before they get anywhere the HUMMER appears from out of
nowhere and Jenko pulls Schmidt out of the ATV just as it’s
PANCAKED beneath the 6000 pound Hummer

Schmidt and Jenko run off once more weaving in between the
buildings on a path too narrow for the Hummer to follow

SCHMIDT
We need a bigger car Or do you
have a problem with the oil and gas
industry

JENKO
No But I’1l1 tell you what I do
have an issue with

SCHMIDT
This oughtta be good

JENKO
The war on drugs

SCHMIDT
Oh for fuck’s sake

JENKO
So we kill or catch this Ghost guy
and someone else will just pop up
in his place Whats the point
(MORE)
42013 96

JENKO (CONTD)
Did catching Walters solve
anything And what about Eric He
was going to go to Berkeley

SCHMIDT
So we should just let people sell
drugs to kids at school Let kids
overdose or jump off a building

JENKO
Of course not That’s why you have
to legalize it

SCHMIDT
Legalize it Are you insane

They come out from between the buildings and come across a
Campus maintenance Golf Cart and Jenko jumps inside

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
(re the Golf Cart)
Really Like this is gonna work
Schmidt climbs in as the Hummer roars around a corner and

The GOLF CART ROCKETS out of its path

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Whoa

CAR CHASE Jenko races the oddly fast cart through campus
the HUMMER smashing everything in its path as it pursues

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
What the fuck is in this thing

Just as it looks like the Hummer is going to overtake the
cart Jenko spins the wheel and heads towards a gap between
two buildings that’s roughly HALF the size of the cart

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
What are you doing

Jenko guns it

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Well never fit Stop Stop Stop

Just before they crash Jenko does whatever it is one does to
get a car onto two wheels a trick he learned from Zook

The Golf Cart obeys Jenko’s command bumping onto two wheels
and squeezing in between the buildings

42013 97

Behind them the Hummer stops short stuck on the other side
as Jenko emerges from the buildings drops the car back down
to four wheels and drives them away to safety

EXT FOOTBALL STADIUM

The Golf Cart screeches to a stop and Jenko eyes the
scoreboard which shows the start of the fourth quarter

JENKO
Fuck fuck fuck

SCHMIDT
We’ll catch those guys don’t
worry

JENKO
That’s not why I’m upset The scout
was here today He was about to
offer me a scholarship to USC

SCHMIDT
What are you talking about You
can’t be a cop and play for USC

JENKO
I know

SCHMIDT
But what about us We’re partners

JENKO
You dont need me It was always me
who needed you And it’s only
because of you that I realized I
can do this But c’mon man you
never needed me you’re the smart
one If you had the money you could
have gone to college and aced it

SCHMIDT
You dont understand I lied about
my parents not having money for
college I went but I didnt last
five minutes Thats why they
offered to wait when they dropped
us off I couldnt bring myself to
go because high school was so bad I
didnt want to be on the outside
looking in again So I tried to be
a cop but I failed at that too

family’s ever had that chance

Jenko turns and runs towards the players’ entrance but a

swarm of campus police block his path and the one whose Smart
Car they stole points a finger at them and nods

because I was still a virgin too

Maya’s stunned Whatever she was expecting

SCHMIDT (CONTD)

I thought by coming to college I

s

this wasn’t it

could finally get a chance to grow
up To stand on my own two feet and

be a man But like everything I
else I try to do I failed

Maya looks at Schmidt and laughs

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
You’re laughing at me

MAYA
Of course I’m laughing at you

Youre kind of a piece of shit but

not because you’re not a man I

mean you showed your weird-looking

balls to a roomful of strangers
And you just told me that you’re

a swimsuit Schmidt in a T-shirt and cargo shorts
42013 111

SCHMIDT
If there are drugs at her meeting
with The Ghost and the dealers we
can get all of them at once

Mercedes hops onto a Jet Ski and Schmidt and Jenko climb onto

two others and follow her out towards a huge party boat

EXT PARTY BOAT
The boat is impossibly crowded with drunken revelers

Schmidt and Jenko follow Mercedes into a downstairs cabin

INT DOWNSTAIRS CABIN

They enter a room filled with rows of women in bikinis
cooking up batches of WhyPhy

SCHMIDT
Bingo

Jenko nods to a second door towards the back of the room

JENKO
Cmon

They walk up and look through the cabin door window to see
Mercedes The Ghost and a bunch of college kids

JENKO (CONTD)
Must be the dealers You ready

SCHMIDT
Let’s do it

INT BACK ROOM - DOWNSTAIRS CABIN

Schmidt and Jenko burst inside guns drawn but six huge
thugs emerge from behind them with bigger guns drawn

THE GHOST
Drop your guns

Schmidt and Jenko drop their guns as they take in the room
and see the Yang brothers among the dealers

SCHMIDT
You guys are dealers

42013

ALAN YANG
Duh WhyPhy’s the shit It makes us
so focused

MIKE YANG
And then makes us so disco

MERCEDES
Zip it Yangs
(to Schmidt and Jenko)
Was this really your entire plan
You two might be the worst cops in
the history of the world

SCHMIDT
Maybe Or maybe we know that the
best information comes from line of
sight intel And maybe my partner
has a tracking device in his
pocket

JENKO
Uh Schmidt

SCHMIDT
Maybe as we speak there are
multiple cops rappelling down the
side of the boat ready to smash in
the windows and arrest all of you

ALAN YANG
Yeah sure these two cant agree on
breakfast let alone plan a raid

JENKO
Uh Schmidt
SCHMIDT

SCHMIDT
It’s true my partner might be a
little rough around the edges but
I assure you he’s not an idiot

JENKO
Yeah an idiot is someone who lets
two unarmed cops blah blah blah
until their back-up is in position

Schmidt pulls a small black disk out of his pocket

SCHMIDT
Hey look at that I did bring it

SCARFACE
(raising his gun)
That ain’t no tracking device

JENKO
No Then why are there little red
dots on your chest

Everyone looks and sees two dots on Scarface’s chest

SCARFACE
Oh shit

SCHMIDT
Ha ha fuck you die

BOOM BOOM Bullets shatter the windows and Scarface drops
down dead Dickson laser-sighted gun in hand swings into the
room Josh gets caught in the rope he was hanging from and
ends up dangling outside the boat

All hell breaks loose as The Ghost and goons exchange fire
with Dickson and Schmidt and Jenko hide behind a table

A few feet away Alan and Mike Yang cower behind a couch
ALAN YANG
This is terrible Why did I let you

talk me into this

MIKE YANG
Me This was all your idea

42013 114

ALAN YANG
It was not You finished my thought
before I could say dealing was a--

MIKE YANG
Terrific idea

ALAN YANG
Terrible idea God I’m so tired
of you finishing all-

MIKE YANG
Your thoughts That’s because you
never let me go first

Schmidt and Jenko watch from around the table

ALAN YANG
I never wanted to go first

MIKE YANG
You didn’t

ALAN YANG
No But I never said anything
because it seemed like we were
always just supposed to agree on
everything

MIKE YANG
It’s okay to disagree We should
have disagreed more

ALAN YANG
From now on let’s agree to
disagree

ACROSS THE ROOM Dickson has to reload and Mercedes The
Ghost and the remaining thugs race out of the room

Dickson Schmidt and Jenko race after them Schmidt and Jenko
grabbing their guns as they go
EXT MAIN DECK

through the throng of gyrating kids

Dickson looks up to see Maya at the far end of the deck

42013 115

DICKSON
Mercedes is Maya’s roommate She’s
gonna kidnap her They always

He races for Maya losing her in the crowd until she
reappears Dickson reaches for her but Mercedes materializes
out of nowhere and puts her gun to Dicksons head

MERCEDES
Let’s go

DICKSON

MERCEDES

Slow and steady grandpa

MAYA
Daddy

Mercedes leads Dickson onto an idling Jet Ski and takes off

On the other side of the boat The Ghost and his goons jump
onto a waiting speed boat

MAYA (CONTD)
(to Schmidt and Jenko)
That bitch has my dad

SCHMIDT
Maya it’s not safe You should get
below deck

MAYA
Are you deaf She’s got my dad
Give me a gun
(off his hesitation)
Give me a motherfucking gun
He reaches into a cargo short pocket and pulls out a gun

SCHMIDT
You know how to use it

MAYA

probably better at it than you are
Maya grabs the gun and takes off on a Jet Ski
Schmidt and Jenko get in a second speed boat

DOUBLE WATER VEHICLE CHASE

FH

42013 116

JET SKIS - Mercedes zips in and out of pockets of kids
frolicking in the water as Maya follows in hot pursuit

SPEED BOATS - The Ghost and his thug race across the water
FIRING at Schmidt and Jenko who follow close behind

SCHMIDT
Listen I have to tell you
something
(beat)
I don’t really like Josh

JENKO
I thought you were best friends

SCHMIDT

No I fucking hate him I hate him
so much I hate that he gets cold
when it’s 71 degrees out I hate
that it takes him an hour and a
half to order a sandwich I hate
that he gets a little crinkle above
his nose when he looks at me like
I’m nuts

(beat)
I want you to be my partner again
Not because I need you because I
like everything better with you

Jenko starts to respond but gunfire cuts him off

JET SKIS - Mercedes weaves in and out of the boats clogging
the narrowing channel Maya zipping behind her

Mercedes looks back at Maya and runs aground on a sand bar

MERCEDES
Fucking shitting fuck

She pushes Dickson off to drop weight the Jet Ski LURCHES
forward and Mercedes’ face SMACKS directly into an OAR

Swung by Maya Mercedes flies backwards off the Jet Ski and
lands on her back at Maya’s feet Maya points her gun at her

MAYA
Don’t fuck with my family

SPEED BOATS - Schmidt and Jenko continue chasing The Ghost
42013 117

JENKO
I have something to tell you too
You know how when the Zetas threw
us in the trunk and we thought we
were gonna die

SCHMIDT
Yeah

JENKO
I figured out why I was so calm
It’s because if I had to die I was
okay dying with you

SCHMIDT
Really

JENKO
Really I’m a Yang and youre a
Yin and I thought I wanted to be
the Yangs but when you and I are
together we make something even
better than Yangs We make Yiangs

The Ghost speeds into a bottleneck of boats and he and his

henchman jump out and RUN ACROSS THE BOAT TOPS
Schmidt and Jenko follow

SCHMIDT
So youll be my partner again

JENKO
On one condition

SCHMIDT
Anything

The bad guys shoot at them again

JENKO
I’11 tell you when people aren’t
shooting at us

As they run the speedier Jenko pulls away from Schmidt
dodging the bikini clad women in the boats as they go

SCHMIDT
Excuse me pardon me
(re a topless beauty)
That kind of behavior is not in
your best interest

42013 118

The Ghost and his henchman reach the end of the logjam where
a series of HOT AIR BALLOONS are moored

The Ghost climbs into one and the henchman begins untying
the ropes holding it down He gets the last rope untied right
as Jenko reaches the end of the logjam and

JENKO POV

SLO-MO as Jenko enters his JOCK ZONE Everything goes to
black but his target and we zip to full speed and Jenko
buries his shoulder in the henchman’s back

BACK TO SCENE

Jenko drives the henchman into the ground knocking him out
cold but The Ghost’s hot air balloon starts to rise

SCHMIDT (CONTD)
Fuck Fuck

Jenko races forward and does a patented Jenko jump leaping
off a boat to a railing and grabs the rope of the balloon
thinking he can stop it from floating away with his weight

But he doesn’t weigh enough and the balloon keeps rising

JENKO
Schmidt Schmidt

In a flash Schmidt springs to action racing forward for a
Jenko leap It’s more Schmenko than Jenko as he hits the
boat ricochets off the railing and leaps and

GRABS JENKO’S LEGS

The rope pulls tight and the balloon descends Together
Schmidt and Jenko weigh enough to anchor the balloon

JENKO (CONTD)
You anchored me You anchored me

They hit the ground and Jenko starts pulling the balloon
back down to Earth hand over hand As The Ghost gets closer
he leans out of the balloon and aims his gun right at Jenko
Schmidt leaps to block the shot The Ghost fires and Schmidt
FALLS THREE FEET SHORT OF JENKO

The bullet rips through Jenko’s shoulder he drops the rope
and the balloon begins to rise once more

42013 119

JENKO (CONTD)
(in serious pain again)
Fuck

SCHMIDT
I tried to take a bullet for you

JENKO
But you didn’t

SCHMIDT
But I tried That’s what matters

JENKO
I know thank you but what matters
is actually taking the bullet

The balloon rises higher and higher

THE GHOST
You lose again assholes

Schmidt digs into his cargo shorts and pulls out a flare gun

SCHMIDT
Cargo shorts motherfucker

Schmidt takes his time aims his gun

JENKO
Shoot this fuck

Schmidt FIRES and the flare hits the propane tank which
spews gas directly into the flame

THE GHOST
Oh

The Ghost SLAMS to the ground at Schmidt’s feet

SCHMIDT
Slam Poetry Yelling triumphant

Schmidt pulls out a can of mace and sprays The Ghost in the

face as Jenko picks up the lyrics Schmidt has stumbled into

JENKO

jump for a bandaged Jenko and Schmidt’s proud parents

DICKSON

relationship built entirely on
lies He lies for a living

DICKSON
