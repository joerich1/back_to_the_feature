EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY
The camera is moving toward an Indian city We are high
far away

only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer

nearer and through the passing clouds these words

No mans life can be encompassed in one telling There
no way to give each year its allotted weight to

each event each person who helped to shape a lifetime
can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record
to try to find ones way to the heart of the man
And now we are approaching the city the squalor of the
shanty dwellings around the outskirts the shadows of

factories And as we move nearer coursing over the

terrain the tiny fields of cultivation strands of

are woven through the main titles borne on the wind
from the life we are seeking

EXTERIOR - CITY - DAY

And now we are over the city coming in toward a
street in the affluent suburbs of New Delhi there
few cars (it is 1948) and we are closing on a milling
near the entrance to one of the larger homes

We see saris Indian tunics a sprinkling of Gandhi
several tongas (two-wheeled horse-drawn taxis) the

one young man Godse

an entrance-way at the back of a long wall

He glances at two policemen who are talking casually
in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another

that pulls up just behind his Two young men (Apte and
Karkare) meet Godses gaze and again we get the sense

imminent danger

They descend and pay their driver absently their eyes
watching the crowd

Sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a
distance down the street an elderly man (Prakash) with
short close-cropped beard and the taut sunken flesh
cadaver is watching

Apte and Karkare look back at him There is just the
acknowledgment and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the
as though to tell them to be about their business

THE GATE AT BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY

Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners

nonchalantly flank the entrance He stiffens himself
cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket

glances back at the stoic face of Prakash Prakashs
as firm and unrelenting as a deaths head Godse turns
wetting his lips nervously then moves into the middle
group going through the gate

GARDEN - BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - TWILIGHT

A fairly numerous crowd is gathering here informally
the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little

Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse
little behind their movements sly and wary aware of

Featuring Gandhi We see him distantly through the

The brown wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and
still weak from his last fast and moving without his
spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand
his walking sticks Manu and Abha

We do not see him clearly until the very last moment --
glimpses of him as he smiles and exchanges little

with some of the crowd and the two young women who

him occasionally joining his hands together in

someone in particular then once more proceeding with a
on the shoulder of each of the girls

The camera keeps moving closer and the point of view

always Godses but Gandhi is always in profile or half
obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front

hear the occasional click of a camera and we intercut
shots of Godse moving tensely up through the crowd of
and Karkare on the periphery of the crowd watching

sudden fear and apprehension like men paralysed by the
presence of danger

His breathing is short and there is perspiration around

moves boldly out into Gandhis path bumping Manu

Ignoring her his nerves even more taut Godse joins

And now we see Gandhi in full shot The cheap glasses

his hands together to exchange Godses greeting

Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of

to his jacket in an instant -- it holds a gun and he
point blank at Gandhi -- loud startling -- once
thrice

Gandhis white shawl is stained with blood as he falls

only hear a strange rhythmic shuffling pierced by an
occasional wail of grief We see the soldiers and

lining the route their hands locked together in one
endless chain We see the two hundred men of the Army

body of Gandhi

And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier
surrounded by flowers a tiny figure in this ocean of

MURROWS VOICE-OVER

Mahatma Gandhi was not a commander
of great armies nor ruler of vast
lands he could boast no scientific
achievements no artistic gift
Yet men governments and dignitaries
from all over the world have joined
hands today to pay homage to this
little brown man in the loincloth
who led his country to freedom

We see the throng following the weapon-carrier bier of
as it slowly inches its way along the Kingsway
Mountbatten tall handsome bemedalled walks at the
of dignitaries from many lands and behind them a
mass of Indians For a moment we see their sandalled
moving along the roadway and realize their quiet
shuffling is the only noise this vast assemblage has

On the edge of the street an American newspaperman
watches as the bier passes him He has been making

his point of view as the weapon-carrier silently rolls
It is personal close Walker clenches his teeth and
is moisture in his eyes as he looks down He tries to

He reaches into this waistcoat and produces a card

presents to the conductor
GANDHI

conduct a case for an Indian trading
firm

EUROPEAN
Didnt you hear me There are no
colored attorneys in South Africa

Gandhi is still puzzled by his belligerence but is
beginning
to react to it this time with a touch of irony

GANDHI
Sir I was called to the bar in London
and enrolled in the High Court of
Chancery -- I am therefore an
attorney and since I am -- in your
eyes -- colored -- I think we can
deduce that there is at least one
colored attorney in South Africa

The Porter stares -- amazed

helplessly We see Mr Baker a wealthy white lawyer

GANDHI

In England I was a poor student but
I --

KHAN
That was England

Gandhi is holding a British legal document he lifts it
pointedly

GANDHI
This part of Englands Empire

SINGH

Mr Gandhi you look at Mr Khan and
see a successful Muslim trader The
South Africans see him simply as an
Indian And the vast majority of
Indians -- mostly Hindu like yourself --

blinking embarrassment

from Gandhi at this

mention of his own

religion)
were brought here to work the mines
and harvest the crops -- and the

Europeans dont want them doing
anything else

Gandhi looks at Mr Baker almost in disbelief

GANDHI
But that is very un-Christian

Mr Baker smothers a smile

TYEB MOHAMMED
Mr Gandhi in this country Indians
are not allowed to walk along a
pavement with a Christian

Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously

GANDHI
You mean you employ Mr Baker as
your attorney but you cant walk
down the street with him

KHAN
I can But I risk being kicked into
the gutter by someone less holy
than Mr Baker
He smiles but his eyes show that it is no joke

Gandhi glances from one to the other them -- absorbing
the

inconceivable And then almost before our eyes his
innocence

of the world fuses with his anger at the injustice of
it

all

GANDHI
Well then it must be fought We
are children of God like everyone
else

KHAN
(dryly)
Allah be praised And what battalions
will you call upon

GANDHI
I -- I will write to the press --
here -- and in England
(He turns to Baker
firmly)
And I will use the courts

He lifts the documents threateningly

SINGH
You will make a lot of trouble

Its tone is chilling and Gandhis firmness is shaken a
little

GANDHI
We are members of the Empire And we
come from an ancient civilization
Why should we not walk on the
pavements like other men

The sturdy Khan is studying him with a look of wry
interest

GANDHI
Ladies and Gentlemen we have asked
you to gather here to help us proclaim
our right to be treated as equal

citizens of the Empire

It is flat and dull like someone reading a speech to
themselves and those in the crowd who had hesitated

wandering off shrug and continue on their way Gandhi
unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder
just as colorlessly
GANDHI
We do not seek conflict We know the

And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over
fire The flames engulf it
The police sergeants eyes go wide with disbelief The

murmurs in shock At last Gandhi has got a reaction

dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his

lamely

He has stepped forward with his constables who have

the crowd halting the tentative movements of the few

one by one making the pranam (the Hindu gesture of
then bending and touching the hands and lips to

feet in the traditional obeisance of child to father

HARILAL
We are glad to have you back Bapu

Gandhi smiles

GANDHI
And I am glad to be back
(He holds his hands
out to Ramdas)
Come
And Ramdas runs to him and Gandhi bends to kiss him as

Ramdas
put his arms around his neck
BA
Be careful
Gandhi pats him indulgently then carefully stands
erect
looking at them all with satisfaction
GANDHI
Tomorrow I will tell you what it
feels like to be a jailbird
The two older boys show the expected apprehension --
and
interest Gandhi nods to the ayah She claps her hands
smartly
AYAH
Come Come
The boys bow and leave like boys used to household
discipline
The ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter at
they
go down the hall
GANDHI
Just like proper English gentlemen
Im proud of them
BA
They are boys -- And theyre Indian
Gandhi is stretching out on the bed taking up another
paper

GANDHI
Hm Will you take this off
(he touches the bandage
on his cheek)
It pinches every time I speak

Ba comes and sits down on the bed beside him
maneuvering so
that she can get at the bandage

GANDHI

is about to pull it)

Yes -- I cant talk like this

Ba pauses and looks at him mischievously as though
not a bad idea He scowls at her then recognizes her
and grins

GANDHI
Pull

Ba pulls one of the strands of tape and Gandhi

GANDHI
Oww

BA
(mockingly)
Mr Khan said they called you brave

Gandhi is nursing the moustache he looks at her wryly

GANDHI
If you would let me teach you to
read you could see for yourself

She leans forward to pull at the remaining piece

BA
I could have told them you were merely
foolish

Gandhi is watching her as she leans across him her
and proximity obviously stirring him

GANDHI
It proves what I told you If I had
prosecuted him as everyone advised --
even you -- they would have hated me --
by showing forgiveness I -- ouch

And she slowly pries the gauze free from the strands of
above his lip As she does Gandhi watches her more and
intently and slips his arms around her back
GANDHI
(as though continuing
the argument)
You see there is such a thing as
moral force -- and it can be
harnessed
Ba examines the bandage and gently touches the wound
she is aware of his burning eyes and arms around her
BA
Not always You have told me twice
now that you were giving up the
pleasures of the flesh
It slows Gandhi uneasily for a moment and Ba must grin
his discomfiture He leans back -- still holding her
looking at the ceiling
GANDHI
I am I am convinced the holy men
are right When you give up you
gain The simpler your life the
better
Ba makes a moue of acceptance and starts to pull free
but his arms still hold her She smothers a smile and
down her face next to his but neither of them looking
each other A long beat and then Gandhi turns his

General Smuts -- sitting erect and imposing on a

Gandhi comes from the house door He carries a

than we have seen him in before His mien the cut of
hair all suggest a passage of time As he turns he
because he is face to face with Charlie Andrews a very
thin Englishman who wears a rumpled white suit anda

collar He has descended from a horse-drawn taxi that

his luggage He too has stopped For a moment they both
appraise each other neither speaking Then

CHARLIE
Youd be Gandhi --
(Gandhi nods)
I thought youd be bigger

GANDHI
Im sorry
CHARLIE
I -- I mean its all right It doesnt

forward and thrusts

out his hand)

street

GANDHI

Would you care to walk

He gestures Charlie on and starts walking

Charlie nods uncertainly He looks back at the cab in
confusion then signals the driver to follow and

to match strides with Gandhis brisk pace

GANDHI
(noting Charlies
collar)
Youre a clergyman

CHARLIE

Yes Ive -- Ive met some very
remarkable people in India and --
and when I read what youve been
doing here I -- I wanted to help

(He looks at Gandhi

then smiles awkwardly)
Does that surprise you

GANDHI
Not anymore
(And now he smiles)

At first I was amazed but when
you are fighting in a just cause
people seem to pop up -- like you --

right out of the pavement Even when
it is dangerous or --

JOHANNESBURG SUBURB - EXTERIOR - MORNING

They have come to a turning nearer to town the area
run-down Ahead of them three youths (twenty twenty-
working clothes carrying lunch boxes lean indolently

a building directly in their path They react to the

of Gandhi -- fun Then stride the pavement menacingly

of them tosses aside his cigarette

FIRST YOUTH
Hey -- look whats comin

SECOND YOUTH
A white shepherd leading a brown
sammy

CHARLIE
Perhaps I should --

Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head

GANDHI
Doesnt the New Testament say If
your enemy strikes you on the right
cheek offer him the left

He starts to move forward Charlie hesitates then

nervously more nervous for Gandhi than himself

CHARLIE
I think perhaps the phrase was used
metaphorically I dont think our

Lord meant --

They are getting closer The youths laughing

GANDHI
Im not so certain I have thought
about it a great deal I suspect he
meant you must show courage -- be
willing to take a blow -- several
blows -- to show you will not strike
back -- nor will you be turned
aside And when --

One youth has flicked his cigarette -- hard It
Gandhis feet He pauses looking at the youth
GANDHI
and when you do that it calls

upon something in human nature --
something that makes his hate for

you diminish and his respect increase

I think Christ grasped that and I --

He starts forward again he is almost on the youths --
frightened but

GANDHI
Good morning

FIRST YOUTH
Get off the pavement you bloody --

And he reaches forth to haul Gandhi from the pavement
A WOMANS VOICE
Colin Colin What are you doing
A woman is leaning out of an upstairs window looking
at the fracas disconcertedly It is the first youths

and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility
considerably

FIRST YOUTH
Nuthing nuthing We were just
cleaning up the neighborhood a little
A snickering response from the other youths -- but they
embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of Colins
attitude Theres no note of apology in her cold stare
Gandhi but she clearly believes her son should not be
what he is doing
COLINS MOTHER
Youre already late for work I
thought youd gone ten minutes ago
The moment of crisis has passed Nothing will happen
she is there
Gandhi steps back on the pavement addressing the first

GANDHI
Youll find theres room for us both
And he steps around him Charlie trailing as the first
youth
stares at them sullenly

As they stride on Charlie glancing back --

CHARLIE
(relieved)
That was lucky

GANDHI
I thought you were a man of God

CHARLIE
(wittily but making
his point)
I am But Im not so egotistical as
to think He plans His day around my
dilemmas

Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner
BUSY STREET - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - MORNING

A busy street in the center of the town Gandhi and
Charlie
come around the corner into it

GANDHI

you could call it a communal
farm I suppose But weve all come
to the same conclusion -- our Gita
the Muslims Koran or your Bible --
its always the simple things that
catch your breath -- Love thy
neighbor as thyself --

(He smiles thinking

back at the youths)
not always practiced -- but its
something we Hindus could learn a
lot from

He has paused before an office and a young girl (Sonja)
has

come from it to speak to him about something of
urgency but

she hovers not interrupting

CHARLIE
Thats the sort of thing youll be
seeking on this farm
GANDHI
(a smile)
Well we shall try

And now he turns to Sonja Behind her we see the small
office

MK GandhiAttorney Several clients waits most of
them

conspicuously poor Sonjas tone is loaded with
foreboding

SONJA
Theyre going to change the pass
laws

Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly
SMUTSS OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY

A strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a
document

SMUTSS VOICE-OVER
Its taken time but it needed to be
done fairly We didnt want to create
an injustice simply because Mr Gandhi
was abusing our existing legislation

Beneath the signature we see the boldly printed
identification Jan Christian Smuts

SECOND VOICE

Another angle A cameraman records the moment with a

Of course We Westerners have a

him grinning

GANDHI
Without a paper -- a journal of some
kind -- you cannot unite a community

(A teasing smile)
You belong to a very important
profession

WALKER
Hm And what should an important
professional write about your
response to General Smutss new
legislation

This carries a weight and apprehension that none of the

surprise
WALKER
Youre a very small minority to take
on the Government -- and the Empire

Gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact
GANDHI

If you are a minority of one the

truth is the truth
Reluctant as it is it too carries commitment and
senses it But they have come by a site where a
being erected and a European (Kallenbach) is perched
a doorway on the half-completed structure getting a

Some Indians are working below him Gandhi turns to

light-hearted again

GANDHI
This is Mr Kallenbach He is our
chief carpenter -- and also our chief

benefactor He has made this
experiment possible

Walker waves his notebook at him and Kallenbach lifts
level in greeting On his bronzed chest there is a Star
David Walker looks around grinning shaking his head

see two women in saris trying to quell some squabbling
children in the background

WALKER
Well its quite a place your
ashram -- is that right
GANDHI

Thats right The word only means
community But it could stand for
village or the world
Walker looks at him appraisingly

WALKER
Youre an ambitious man

GANDHI
(uncertainly)

I hope not

A moment of embarrassed doubt then he starts toward a

half-

finished building -- wooden sides door but canvas
still

covering the roof It has an awning spread before it
Walkers

carriage is tethered nearby a Black driver standing in
the

sun waiting In the background we see two women
cleaning a
latrine Walker glances at the latrine

WALKER
They tell me you also take your turn
at peeling potatoes and cleaning the
outhouse -- is that part of the
experiment

As we have approached we see a table set for tea under

the

awning There are two places Having set the places Ba
is

walking along the side of the building away from them
She

glances at Gandhi tautly and deliberately avoids
speaking or
acknowledging him

GANDHI
(a little surprised
a little annoyed)
Ba -- we will need another place set
for Mr Walkers driver

Ba looks at him coldly

BA
I will tell Sora

She turns back and walks into the building by the rear

entrance Gandhi is disconcerted by her attitude but
he

tries to answer Walker

is

aware

suppressed

GANDHI
Its one way to learn that each mans
labor is as important as anothers
In fact when youre doing it
cleaning the outhouse seems far
more important than the law

A grin -- but forced When a girl (Sora) comes from the
building bringing another cup and place setting Gandhi

to the driver

GANDHI
Please come and join us -- youll
need something before your journey

back
(He nods to Walker)

Excuse me a moment
And he goes into the building determined to find the
of Bas aloofness
GANDHIS HUT - INTERIOR - DAY
Ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear
the building She does not look up at Gandhi but she
aware of his presence He crosses and stands in front
with all the irritation of a husband It is hushed
that Walker might overhear them but bristling with
anger

GANDHI
What is it

Now Ba looks at him hostilely

BA

Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must
rake and cover the latrine

GANDHI
Everyone takes his turn

BA
It is the work of untouchables
GANDHI
In this place there are no
untouchables -- and no work is beneath
any of us

BA
(she looks up at him)
I am your wife

GANDHI
All the more reason

He holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his
BA
(finally scornfully)

As you command

As she starts to rise he grabs her arm but she pulls

free
BA
The others may follow you -- but you
forget I knew you when you were a

boy

She says it derisively and it stings but Gandhi is
aware of
Walker and he fights to hold his temper

GANDHI
Its not me Its the principle And
you will do it with joy or not do it
at all

Ba settles back defiantly

BA
Not at all then

For a moment Gandhi stares at her and she back at him

resentfully He suddenly reaches down and grabs her
arm

pulling her roughly to her feet

GANDHI
All right go You dont belong here
Go Leave the ashram Get out
altogether We dont want you

the

back

It is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the
door opening it to push her out as she struggles
him

BA
Stop it Stop it What are you doing

She lurches free of his grip glaring at him angrily
moment they both stare at each other shattered by
violence
BA
(bitterly)
Have you no shame Im your wife
(Like lead)
Where do you expect me to go
Gandhi stares at her breathlessly his temper subsiding
a dazed remorse He sinks numbly to a stool sitting
his head in his hands Ba studies him for a moment --
she sighs her temper and breathing subsiding too She

and kneels before him

GANDHI
What is the matter with me

A moment then she soothes the top of his head -- like
mother-wife she is

BA

(a beat)
You are human -- only human

Gandhi looks up at her blankly abjectly
BA
And it is even harder for those of
us who do not even want to be as

good as you do

And Gandhi grins weakly Ba catches it and sends it

GANDHI
I must go back to that reporter
Ba nods
BA
And I must rake and cover the
latrine

Gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her She

at him evenly -- no smile but the warmth still in her

IMPERIAL THEATER - INTERIOR - NIGHT

The theater is packed The front rows near the stage
held by rich Muslim merchants the back of the stalls
small traders peddlers artisans -- Muslim Hindu
Sikh The gallery is bulging with indentured laborers -
largely Hindu The mood is restless belligerent

On the stage Gandhi moves forward and he holds up his
for silence Seated on the stage are Khan Singh three
leaders of the Indian community Charlie Andrews and
Kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs
looks around the audience and we see the packed house
his point of view ending with two plainclothes

policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front
subsides

his

policemen

rhetoric

and
stare

Gandhi

hand

A uniformed policeman stands near them

GANDHI
(to the house)
I want to welcome you all

A buzz then applause -- loud and defiant When is
Gandhi looks down at the plainclothes policemen fixing
gaze on them

GANDHI
Every one of you
(Then still at them)
We -- have -- no -- secrets

And again the audience bursts into applause The

just sit like stone -- confident sure immune to

GANDHI

Let us begin by being clear about
General Smutss new law All Indians
must now be fingerprinted -- like
criminals Men and women

(A rising angry

response Gandhi

just waits)
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid Under
this Act our wives and mothers are
whores And every man here a
bastard

In the gallery a rhythmic pounding signals the anger
protest and is taken up around the hall The police
imperturbably Khan leans towards Singh nodding to
KHAN
Hes become quite good at this
Singh smiles at the understatement Gandhi holds up his
silencing the hall

GANDHI
And a policeman passing an Indian
dwelling -- I will not call them
homes -- may enter and demand the
card or any Indian woman whose
dwelling it is

A VOICE
God damn them

Gandhi just waits

GANDHI
Understand He does not have to stand
at the door -- he may enter
Now a violent response -- a large powerful merchant
rises
in the third row
MERCHANT
I swear to Allah I will kill the man
who offers that insult to my home
and my wife
(A guttural cheer he
glares at the police)
And let them hang me
Another cheer When it subsides Tyeb Mohammed rises
near
the back where he is seated with a number of other
young
men
TYEB MOHAMMED
I say talk means nothing Kill a few
officials before they disgrace one
Indian woman -- then they might think
twice about such laws
The police half rise to look back at him but there is
a

smattering of applause and several stand to look back
TYEB MOHAMMEDS FRIEND
In that cause I would be willing to

die

And now there is general applause Gandhi waits then

GANDHI
I praise such courage I need such
courage -- because in this cause I

too am prepared to die
(A response he looks

at Tyeb Mohammed)
But my friend there is no cause
for which I am prepared to kill

He looks at the audience This is the more sober Gandhi
they
have come to know

GANDHI

I have asked you here tonight because
despite all their troops and police
I think there is a way to defeat
this law Whatever they do to us we
will attack no one kill no one
But we will not

(the climatic point)
give our fingerprints -- not one of
us

He looks down at the police making the point stick
There

is a tentative reaction from the audience but
uncertain

GANDHI
They will imprison us they will
fine us They will seize our
possessions But they cannot take
away our self-respect if we do not
give it to them

VOICE FROM THE GALLERY
Have you been to prison Theyll
beat us and torture us I say --

GANDHI
I am asking you to fight --
(It catches the
audience a little
holds them)
To fight against their anger -- not
to provoke it

He has their attention now

GANDHI
We will not strike a blow -- but we
will receive them And through our
pain we will make them see their
injustice
(quickly)
and it will hurt as all fighting
hurts
(Utter silence)
But we cannot lose We cannot
(He looks down at the
police)
Because they may torture my body
may break my bones even kill me
(Up to the house)
They will then have my dead body --
not my obedience

And now he gets the response he has wanted Firm

mature
determined Gandhi holds up his hand
GANDHI
We are Hindu and Muslim -- children
of God each of us Let us take a
solemn oath in His name that -- come
what may -- we will not submit to
this law
He looks at the audience A second then a merchant
stands
signifying his pledge And then another Then Tyeb
Mohammed
and the youths about him Then all over the theater
they
begin to stand and on the stage until everyone is
standing
It is all done is silence Gandhi looks at the full
theater --
all standing He takes a step forward
GANDHI
(a coarse singing)
God save our gracious King Long
live our
(the audience takes
it up)

(And their voices
fill the auditorium)

MINE AREA - EXTERIOR - DAY
Gandhi Singh and Tyeb Mohammed are leading a large
of Indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining

sheds elevator platforms pulleys -- toward a distant

We see crude handworked banners We are Citizens of
Empire Justice for All One King -- One Law

Tyeb Mohammed suddenly touches Gandhis arm and nods

Their point of view A canvas-topped open touring car
1910) pulls out from a turning between two factory
and comes towards them
Resume Gandhi There is a little hesitation in the
the car approaches In it we can see two uniformed
and a civilian
The car swings across the center of the road and stops
in front of Gandhi
CIVILIAN
These men are contracted laborers
They belong in the mines
GANDHI
You have put their comrades in jail
When you free them they will go back

to work

The civilian smiles slowly He looks from Gandhi to the
miners

CIVILIAN
Ive warned you

GANDHI
We have warned each other

The civilian looks at him sharply then smiles
signaling the car off As it pulls away Tyeb Mohammed

and

Singh come up to Gandhi both made wary by the mans
evident

satisfaction with what has transpired

SINGH
I dont think that is very good

Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly then
turns

and signals the miners on They start forward

Their point of view The car rides on past the factory

building out of which it turned and suddenly mounted
police

come swinging out from the buildings and face the
procession

Tracking back before Gandhi Singh and Tyeb Mohammed as
they

move forward fear suddenly making their pace more
labored

Tracking back before the mounted police

SERGEANT
At the canter -- for-ward

They come on fast batons at the ready Gandhi screws
up his

courage marching on Tyeb Mohammed sets his jaw in
defiance

Singh forces himself along at Gandhis side The
mounted

police riding on batons at the ready

Featuring an Indian miner He is in the front rank of
the

procession watching the horses approach He has a
blunt

farmers face

MINER

The sense of the idea seizes Gandhi and as the sound

GANDHI
Lie down Lie down

And the miners begin to go down some face up

their faces with their hands some burying their faces
the earth and covering their heads with their hands
Close fast traveling the sergeants point of view We
at the prone miners

Close on Gandhi his arms crossed in front of his face
staring up frightened but determined to bear it

Wide angle The horses cannot bring themselves to
over the human carpet they rear plunge swerve
Close shot -- miner who shouted down He is peering
his crossed hands a tight smile of satisfaction at

confirmed He turns to see

The sergeant thrown off his horse He lands heavily
up furious darts after it Mounting he is enraged to
laughter
Close shot Singh and the miner who shouted Down
grinning at the chaos

men

The wounded miner himself starts to stagger up
The sergeant sweeps them his eyes glittering -- this

deal with But --

GANDHI
Lie down Lie down

It is a command and angry in its own way but it

all the weight of his influence on them They begin to
down again and the sergeant wheels his horse and rides
Gandhi

With deliberate almost fatalistic pace Gandhi goes

to his knees and then sprawls down flat his hands over
top of his head awaiting the blow of the horses hoof
Close shot the horses head its eyes rolling as it

again

Close shot the sergeant controlling it cursing but
to make it plunge down on the man

Full shot the sergeant wheeling his horse angrily --
surveying the whole of the procession as they lie

on the ground his mounted police circling in front of
not knowing what to do

SMALL CHURCH - SOUTH AFRICA - INTERIOR - DAY
We are close on Charlie Andrews
CHARLIE
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr Gandhi has at last been put into

prison

The congregation is listening to him stiffly
unsympathetically and there is more than one murmur of

at his words The clergyman who has given Charlie the

his pulpit sits beneath it embarrassed but sticking
resolutely to his decision to give Charlie a hearing

Gandhi --

CHARLIE
But I would ask you -- assembled
here in this house of God -- to
recognize that we are witnessing
something new something so
unexpected so unusual that it is
not surprising the Government is at
a loss What Mr Gandhi has forced
us to do is ask questions about
ourselves

A few men in the congregation rise and pointedly escort
families from the church Charlie struggles on
CHARLIE

As Christians those are difficult
questions to answer How do we treat

men who defy an unjust law -- men
who will not fight but will not
comply

More of the congregation rise and march from the
though a few pointedly do not

PRISON YARD - EXTERIOR - DAY

Small packed Gandhi is threading his way in a line
soup But it is a line that winds through masses of
some with bowls eating some not yet in the line

As Gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large
barrels of soup he sees that Khan is serving from one

them He too wears a prison uniform and there is a

on his head When he turns and reacts to the sight of

GANDHI
Theyre sparing no one I see

KHAN
No You were the surprise Its been
all over the prison We thought theyd
be too afraid of the English press

GANDHI
So did I
He takes his soup from Khan

KHAN
(acidly)
Dont worry about the meat -- its
Hindu
(referring to the
soup)
-- theres not a trace

Gandhi smiles but they turn as the gate opens and a
paddy

wagon is backed into the press of prisoners Khan
shakes his

head

KHAN
I dont know who theyve left out
there to do the work There cant be
one mine left open Have they touched
the women

GANDHI
My wife publicly defied the law
Theyve arrested her and four others

KHAN
(angrily)
The fools
(He spills some soup)
Sorry

GANDHI
Its split the Government

KHAN
Well thats one victory

Gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled
bandages
the defiant determined faces

GANDHI
If we hold firm it wont be the
last

glances reveal who Gandhi is The prison officers eyes
on him
CITY STREET - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - DAY

A side street but active Gandhi -- now manacled -- is

marched down the pavement before two guards The prison
officer strides in front of them People in the street

and turn staring That part of Gandhi that is still
dandy is discomfited but there is a growing part of
that defies appearances

Featuring a doorway It is the side door of a large
building The prison officer leads his little

toward it He knocks and the door opens The tall civil
servant has been waiting for them The prison officer

forward and undoes Gandhis manacles

GOVERNMENT BUILDING - INTERIOR - DAY

The tall civil servant moving with aloof distaste for
assignment walks ahead of Gandhi who in turn is

by one of the prison guards toward a grand staircase

SMUTSS OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY
We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts but
we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure
makes as he stands behind the grand desk
SMUTS

Ah Mr Gandhi I thought we might

have a little talk
He nods to the tall civil servant who bows and closes
door Smuts crosses the room toward a small cabinet

SMUTS
Will you have a glass of sherry

GANDHI
Thank you No

Smuts looks at Gandhi a little surprised at the frigid
of that refusal

SMUTS
Perhaps some tea

GANDHI
(a shake of the head)
I dined at the prison

SMUTS
Ahh

He appraises Gandhi measuring the irony of his words

his
determination Then with a little sigh at the lost
opportunity
he replaces the stopper on the sherry turns and
gestures
Gandhi on into the room
SMUTS
Please -- please do come and sit
down Its prison I wanted to talk
to you about
He has indicated a chair near his desk but as Gandhi
goes
forward he pauses by a spread of papers from England on
a
long table near the middle of the room We see one
headline
in close shot Thousands Imprisoned in South
AfricaMines
Close Crops Unharvested a subhead Gandhi Leads
Non-
Violent Campaign He looks at Smuts Smuts smiles a
passing

nod at the papers

SMUTS
Mr Gandhi Ive more or less decided
to ask the House to repeal the Act
that you have taken such exception
to

GANDHI
(a beat)
Well if you ask General Smuts Im
sure it will be done

Smuts smiles
SMUTS

Hm Of course it is not quite that
simple
GANDHI
Somehow I expected not

A wry smile and he sits on the edge of the chair Smuts
has

directed him to Smuts measures him again not
absolutely

certain how to deal with him A pause and he affects
to

take Gandhis irony at face value

SMUTS

Im glad to hear you say that
very glad You see if we repeal the
Act under pressure

(a nod at the papers

again)
under this kind of pressure it will
create a great deal of resentment
Can you understand that

GANDHI
Very well

And Gandhi does understand it -- as a guiding
principle
Never humiliate your enemy And his tone conveys it

SMUTS

(a bit surprised)
Good Good

(The bland politician

the compromise)
I have thought of calling for a Royal
Commission to investigate the new
legislation

(He gestures implying

theyll do what

theyre told)
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the Act be repealed

GANDHI
(waiting for the catch)
I congratulate them

Smuts does a slight double take a smile then the
tough

politician

SMUTS
But they might also recommend that
future Indian immigration be severely
restricted -- even stopped

He measures Gandhi challengingly obviously expecting
some
contest Gandhi mulls it then

GANDHI
Immigration was not an issue on which
we fought It would be wrong of us
to make it one now that we -- we are
in a position of advantage

Smuts stares at him a moment then

SMUTS
Youre an extraordinary man

GANDHI
(his grin he brushes
at his prison garb)
I assure you I feel a very ordinary
man at this moment

And now Smuts smiles with him He bends suddenly and
signs a
group of documents

SMUTS
Im ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next twenty-
four hours You yourself are free
from this moment

Gandhi stands a little uncertain about the sudden
change in

his status Smuts signs the last document then sees
Gandhis

doubt -- and misreads it

SMUTS
Assuming we are in agreement

GANDHI
Yes -- yes Its just that in
these clothes Id -- Id prefer to
go by taxi

SMUTS

(confused by his
hesitation)
All right Fine

GANDHI
Im -- Im afraid I have no money

SMUTS
Oh
(He quickly feels in
his waistcoat pockets --
and realizes he has
no money)
Neither have I
(He reaches forth and
touches a buzzer)
Im awfully sorry

The tall civil servant (Daniels) enters

SMUTS
Daniels would you lend Mr Gandhi a
shilling for a taxi

Daniel stares

DANIELS
I beg your pardon sir

SMUTS
(a second thought)
How far will you be going Mr Gandhi

GANDHI

(a mischievous smile)
Well -- now that this is settled --
I had thought seriously of going
back to India

(he faces the startled

Daniel)
but a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment

Still a little confused Daniels reaches in his pocket

and
produces a shilling He hands it to Gandhi

And his own steel shows in the oblique reference to the
ignominy of his way in Daniel bows and he and Smuts

stare as the uniformed prisoner goes out through the
doors past the stunned men in the office to the outer
and on to the grand staircase The prison guard appears
the doorway looking off in confusion at Gandhi then
at the office for guidance Daniels simply shakes his

Mr Jinnah our joint host member

of Congress and the leader of the

fear is awaiting trial for sedition

Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah now he looks a little

at Prakash Prakash grins and makes the pranam to
PRAKASH
I have not actually pulled a trigger
Mr Gandhi I have simply written
that if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law then it is
an Indians duty to kill an Englishman
for enforcing his law in a land that
is not his

Gandhi nods

GANDHI
It is a clever argument I am not
sure it will produce the end you
desire

He meets Prakashs gaze firmly the first moment we

have
seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa

male not in European clothes

Im not certain But I wouldnt be
surprised

stands

listening seemingly tongue-tied in the sophisticated
patter

And we cut to Charlie introducing Gandhi to a man in
obvious

ill health but well dressed looking like the
professor

philosopher and elder statesman he is (Gokhale)

CHARLIE
I lied to you Mohan when I told
you I decided to come to South Africa
to meet you Professor Gokhale sent
me

Gokhale is pleased Gandhi amused He bows very
respectfully

GOKHALE
Were trying to make a nation Gandhi --
and the British keep trying to break
us up into religions and
principalities and provinces What
you were writing in South Africa --
thats what we need here

He has offered his hand during this and Gandhi has
helped

him from the garden chair he has been seated on
handing him

the cane that is resting against it

GANDHI
(a smile)
I have much to learn about India
And I have to begin my practice again --
one needs money to run a journal
Another grin Gokhale has started to walk with him

looking
at him intently penetratingly
GOKHALE
Nonsense
(He turns to Charlie)
Go on Charlie This is Indian talk --
we want none of you imperialists
It is brusque but affectionate we know he regards
Charlie
as Gandhi does and Charlie does too
CHARLIE
(a mock threat)
All right -- Ill go and write my
report to the Viceroy
GOKHALE
Go and find a pretty Hindu woman and
convert her to Christianity -- thats
as much mischief as youre allowed
He still hasnt smiled but Gandhi and Charlie have
ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN
This is private -- beautiful and still Gandhi walks
along

slowly taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale

GOKHALE
Forget your practice India has many
men with too much wealth -- it is

their privilege to nourish the efforts
of the few who can raise India from
servitude and apathy I will see to

it -- you begin your journal

GANDHI
I have little to say India is an
alien country to me

the other in a tunic The sound of the train stopping
VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY

Close shot Incense rising in shot The camera pulls
and back The incense is burning in a bowl sitting
Gandhi on a make-shift platform set in the little
between the train line and the little hill where the
men have been hanged A small crowd sits in a crescent

him Ba and Charlie are bent in prayer on the platform
him When the camera comes to rest the edge of the

gallows
and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame
We
know we are looking from someones point of view near
the
prison wall
Finally Gandhi lifts his head
GANDHI
(at first distant as
from the hill)
I ask you to pray for those who died
(Closer)
For the English soldiers
(a murmur)
who were doing what they thought was
right
(Closer)
And for the brave terrorists whose
patriotism led them to do what was
wrong
The murmur of resistance from the crowd is louder at
this
Gandhi shakes his head at the dissent

PATEL

I agree with Jinnah Now that the
Americans are in the war will end
soon The Germans are worn out as it
is

Nehru)
and our first act should be to convene
a Congress Party convention and demand
independence

Nehru takes an iced drunk from a servant

JINNAH
And we must speak with one voice --
united

The others assent Nehru shakes his head wistfully

PATEL
(it reminds him)
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi What
the devil has happened to him anyway

NEHRU
Hes discovering India

JINNAH

Which is a lot better than causing

GANDHI
(amused but
disconcerted)
What are you doing
CHARLIE
(grimly)
Going nearer to God

Gandhi baffled a second sees the outstretched hand

them and in puckish complicity helps boost Charlie

JINNAH

(gradually fading in)
We were asked for toleration We
were asked for patience Some gave
it and some did not Well their war
is over And those of us who supported
it and those of us who refused must
forget our differences

The camera has been moving in now it jumps to Jinnah

close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid
delivery on the audience

At last he moves back to his place on the platform
clasps his hand in congratulation Others crowd around
And fleetingly just in the edge of picture we see

again the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at

of the second row on the platform He is just watching
flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah
Featuring Patel approaching the microphone stilling

PATEL
And let no one question that Mr
Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims --

And again the audience cheers and applauds his little
He raises his hands stilling them again
PATEL

And now Im going to introduce to
you a man whose writings we are all

becoming familiar with a man who
stood high in the esteem of our
beloved Professor Gokhale a man

whose accomplishment in South Africa

will always be remembered Mr

Mohandas Gandhi

Patel gestures him to it

PATEL
(politely)
Your journal has made a great impact

Gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of
GANDHI
I am flattered by Mr Patel
(His grin)
I would be even more flattered if
what he said were true
He means about the journal
Patel has wandered back toward the others his mind
on them But he has half heard Gandhis comment and
a smile a politicians flexibility --
PATEL

(loudly he is away
from the mike)

But its true I -- I read it
often
Again Gandhi grins -- and takes glasses from his

This is the first time we have seen them He has one
paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium
puts his glasses on and faces the convention

GANDHI
Since I returned from South Africa
I have traveled over much of India
And I know I could travel many more
years and still only see a small
part of it

On the platform the whispered politics go on On the
of the convention some listen some talk of other
GANDHI

and yet already I know what we
say here means nothing to the masses
of our country

Nehru has turned having caught that last remark He

touches
Patel on the shoulder Listen

GANDHI
Here we make speeches for each other --
and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines

And now they are beginning to pay attention on the
floor of
the hall too

GANDHI
But the people of India are untouched
Their politics are confined to bread
and salt

Jinnah too is listening now -- aloofly challengingly

GANDHI
Illiterate they may be but they are
not blind They see no reason to
give their loyalty to rich and
powerful men who simply want to take
over the role of the British in the
name of freedom

There is dissent on the floor and on the platform --
but it
is muttered and English polite Gandhi goes on

GANDHI
This Congress tells the world it
represents India My brothers India
is seven hundred thousand villages
not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi
and Bombay Until we stand in the
fields with the millions who toil
each day under the hot sun we will
not represent India -- nor will we
ever be able to challenge the British
as one nation

He takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence
starts

back toward his place on the platform A cameraman
flashes a

who stand in the doorways

Nehru who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and
surprise turns to Patel

NEHRU
Have you read his magazine

PATEL
No -- but I think Im going to

THE TRAIL TO GANDHIS ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

An open touring car struggling along the bumpy trail
drives four friends as young as he with him all
the same expensive British manner

FIRST FRIEND
This cant be the way

Nehru is looking a little harassed from the ragging he
taking and from the ride The ashram is only half-
the ground unworked the buildings only partially
and the whole looking like some primitive frontier

They are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is

right across the path

SECOND FRIEND
(a mocking quote)
Yes Im sure this is the direction
India is taking

The others laugh Nehru suffers

SECOND FRIEND
To think I almost got excited by Mr
Jinnah when all this was awaiting
me
Andrews

sheaves of

river

ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

Nehru has half risen in his seat to address Charlie
who walking from one somnolent building to another
stopped dead at the sight of the car He carries
page proofs

NEHRU
Were looking for Mr Gandhi

CHARLIE
Ah youll find him under the tree
by the river
(He points off then
glances at the car)
Youd better leave the car -- the
ground is rather soft

NEHRU
Thank you

He looks around the ashram a little dismally

FIRST FRIEND
(drolly as he climbs
out)
Come on Im anxious to meet this
new force

ASHRAM - TREE BY RIVER - EXTERIOR - DAY

Gandhi sits under a tree peeling potatoes Nehru and
friends are sprawled out around him Beside them the
in the background the business of the ashram goes on

GANDHI

I try to live like an Indian as you
see it is stupid of course because
in our country it is the British who
decide how an Indian lives -- what
he may buy what he may sell And
from their luxury in the midst of
our terrible poverty they instruct
us on what is justice and what is
sedition

(He looks at them a
teasing but mordant

grin)
So it is only natural that our best
young minds assume an air of Eastern
dignity while greedily assimilating
every Western weakness as quickly as
they can acquire it

His smile is sardonic but genuine theirs embarrassed

and
self-conscious
NEHRU
(defensively)
If we have Home Rule that will change
Gandhi has finished the last potato He glances at
Nehru
then drops the potato in the bowl He lifts the pail of
peelings to Nehru
GANDHI
Would you please
Nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly
His

friends watch with amusement but they too rise to
follow as
they head for the kitchen

GANDHI
And why should the English grant us
Home Rule Here we must take the
peelings to the goats

He re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three
goats
are tethered but he keeps right on talking

GANDHI
We only make wild speeches or perform
even wilder acts of terrorism Weve
bred an army of anarchists but not
one single group that can really
fight the British anywhere

NEHRU
(surprised)

I thought you were against fighting

They have reached the trough
on
and

from

deeper
catches

waiting

potatoes

humor

watch

GANDHI
Just spread it around -- they like
the new peelings mixed with the
rotting ones

Nehru has carefully walked around something distasteful
the ground now he dumps the peelings along the trough

spreads them delicately Gandhi scoops some peelings

the trough to feed a goat that nudges him

GANDHI

Where there is injustice Ive always
believed in fighting

(He looks at Nehru)
The question is do you fight to change
things or do you fight to punish

(His smile)
For myself I have found that we are
all such sinners we should leave
punishment to God And if we really
want to change things there are better
ways of doing it than by derailing
trains or slashing someone with a
sword

He meets Nehrus gaze and for a moment something
than argument passes between them Then something
Gandhis eye He looks off Ba stands watching him
BA
The fire is ready
Gandhi turns The goat is reaching for his bowl of
He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen

Clothes are dipped in the brownish water Ba and an

unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others
him He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment then
the food to his mouth like a man who is starving and
desperately not to show it
Close shot Ba The solemn intensity of her gaze
her identification with the mans agony She glances up

TRAIN STATION - CHAMPARAN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

of an approaching train From its distant glow we can
that people line the platform of the small station
but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be
The station house An open staff car pulls up through
press of the crowd An English captain leaps out and
aggressively through the mass of bodies toward the

The two men join hands and the captain is hoisted up

background

On the roof The captain stands erect

ENGLISH CAPTAIN
What the hell is it Sergeant

He is now standing and his face has frozen It needs no

ENGLISH CAPTAIN
Jesus

He turns his head slowly his mouth agape at His point

view The whole of the obscurely lit platform is

thick with waiting crowds They engulf the station

back and front and on the other side of the train more
are packed all along its length and beyond them along

narrow street that stretches through the little

of houses adjoining the station every rooftop is

men women with babes in arms children There is no
excitement hardly any movement -- just a vast

of people waiting silently is the darkness -- and as
camera pans we see that the crowd extends

even beyond the range of light

I dont know sir The agent says
they got a telegram and it just said
he is coming and gave the time of
the train

ENGLISH CAPTAIN
Who the hell is he

SERGEANT PUTNAM
I dont know sir

Featuring Gandhi He has stepped down from the train
guides him Ba and Charlie a step or two behind Gandhi
through the silent crowd his hands in the pranam
little to either side As he advances the crowd parts
is almost eerily silent As their clothes indicate the

is Muslim so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the
forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to

as he moves through them Most of the faces are gaunt
lean A destitute people
And suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of
the concrete platform and the English captain shoves
way through to confront Gandhi down the little aisle
was being made for him The sergeant and part of the
and behind the captain
The captain stares Then he looks around at the crowd
suspiciously a touch of inner fear then back to
ENGLISH CAPTAIN
Who the devil are you

GANDHI
My name is Gandhi Mohandas K Gandhi

There is a flicker of recognition but uncertain The

captain
stiffens a steeling of the will Another glance at the
crowd
this time with an air of outraged authority
ENGLISH CAPTAIN
Well whoever you are we dont want
you here I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves the
station
GANDHI
(calmly a glance at
the crowd)
They seem to want me
ENGLISH CAPTAIN
Now look here Ill put you under
arrest if youd prefer
GANDHI
On what charge
It has the cold assurance of a lawyer and the Captain
isa
little shaken by it He glances at Charlie who stands
behind
Gandhi now and it makes him all the more uncertain
ENGLISH CAPTAIN
I dont want any trouble
He tries to make it severe but it is a comedown
GANDHI
I am an Indian traveling in my own
country I see no reason for trouble
It is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it
that
the Captain doesnt like but Gandhis unrelenting
stare

unnerves him He glances at Charlie again

moves forward again making the pranam they return it

flushed greetings Gandhi -- Gandhi -- Bapu --

PEASANTS DWELLING - INTERIOR - DAY

The early light of the sun illumines the dwelling We
aman in middle age but one who looks ill and drawn
He lies on a straw mat

MEHA
For years the landlords have ordered
us to grow indigo for dyeing the
cloth Always they took part of the
crop as rent

Gandhi sits cross-legged listening It is the kind of
listening that opens the heart Behind him a mass of

sits stoically outside the dwelling waiting while
case is heard Meha tries to speak unemotionally but

Gandhis sympathetic gaze his despair keeps cracking

MEHA
But now the English factories make
cloth for everyone No one wants our
indigo And the landlords wont take
their share They say we must pay
our rent in cash

Near to breakdown he gestures around the empty house

remains We see two young men one seventeen perhaps

other older anda girl sixteen And finally Mehas
sitting near Ba the two women listening together but
wife looks like a woman who has given up her hair is
and hardly combed her sari dirty

Meha looks at Gandhi and shakes his head hopelessly
nods He stands slowly

GANDHI
What we can do we will try to do

The words are said bleakly not to raise false hopes
glances at Mehas wife Water comes to her eyes and
lowers her head Ba puts her hands on her shoulders and
her to her and the woman breaks and sobs and sobs

he is full of righteous authority

THE COURTHOUSE AND JAIL - MOTIHARI - EXTERIOR - DAY

A small building on a little Anglicized square It is
surrounded by a milling angry throng of peasants

Featuring the front entrance The English captain who
the station when Gandhi arrived is on the top step
harried and tense A small detachment of Indian troops
the step below him Charlie Andrews is pushing through

crowd toward the captain As he approaches the Indian
sergeant holds up his hand

CHARLIE
(firmly)
I wish to see the prisoner please
The captain looks at his clerical collar his English
his determination
CAPTAIN
(reluctantly)
All right Sergeant
Charlie moves through the Indian soldiers and up toward
entrance The captain stares out worriedly over the
crowd
COURTHOUSE JAIL - INTERIOR - DAY
A basement chamber -- dark thick-walled and poorly

camera has panned off a close shot of Gandhi as he

his cell at the sound of a door opening and approaching
footsteps We have seen only his head and shoulders

are covered in a shawl

A police guard leads Charlie across the rough
glimpse

his

grin

He is

his

floor As he comes to Gandhis cell we get a fleeting
of Gandhi sitting on a low pallet bed
Close shot Gandhi as he recognizes his visitor

GANDHI
Charlie--

Reverse on Charlie He looks down at Gandhi and shakes
head
CHARLIE

(a somber grin)
Shades of South Africa

Close shot Gandhi Head and shoulders He returns the
but anger and determination still dominate his mood
GANDHI
Not quite Theyre only holding me
until the Magistrates hearing Then
it will be prison
CHARLIE
(sympathetically)
Did they take your clothes
And now we see Gandhi in full shot for the first time
wearing only a white loincloth the shawl over his
and sandals -- the costume he will wear for the rest of

life

GANDHI
These are my clothes now

Charlie studies him a moment and being Charlie he
understands

CHARLIE
(affectionately)
You always had a puritanical streak
Mohan

He grins and it elicits a little grin from Gandhi

GANDHI
(in a tone of
defensiveness)
If I want to be one with them I
have to live like them

CHARLIE
I think you do
(A smile)
But I thank God we all dont

And Gandhi laughs

GANDHI
Im sure your legs are quite as
handsome as mine

CHARLIE
Ah but my puritanism runs the another
way Im far too modest for such a
display

And again Gandhi laughs Charlie turns to the guard
CHARLIE
Couldnt I be let in with the
prisoner I am a clergyman

The police guard hesitates and then unlocks the cell

Charlie enters and sits on a little wooden stool

opposite
Gandhi his long legs awkwardly filling most of the
space
between them Gandhi has remained seated pensive
Charlie
studies him a moment
CHARLIE
(a bit puzzled)
Theyre calling you Bapu I thought
it meant father
GANDHI
(wistfully)
It does We must be getting old
Charlie
A little grin but his mood remains pensive -- and
remote
CHARLIE

What do you want me to do
Gandhi looks up -- his anger his determination there

but
then broken by a hopeless sigh
GANDHI
I think Charlie that you can help
us most by taking that assignment
youve been offered in Fiji
Charlie is stunned and obviously hurt Gandhi proceeds
more
gently
GANDHI
I have to be sure -- they have to be
sure -- that what we do can be done
by Indians alone

And now Charlie understands Gandhi smiles warmth and

sadness Then he speaks with a determined
purposefulness a

friends trust

GANDHI
But you know the strategy The world
is full of people who will despise
whats happening here It is their
strength we need Before you go you
could start us in the right direction

He has taken some scratched notes from under the
bedding and
handed them to Charlie Charlie nods He sighs and

rises
slowly
CHARLIE
I must leave from Calcutta and soon
Youll have to say goodbye to Ba for
me
Gandhi rises glancing wryly at the prison walls He
nods
GANDHI
When I get the chance
And now he faces Charlie this is the moment of
farewell

THE COURTROOM - MOTIHARI - INTERIOR - DAY

It is packed to overflowing restless Gandhi sits in
dock One or two sergeants-at-arms are trying to keep

coming from the mobs outside the courtroom that fills
atmosphere with threat

The magistrate (English) is surveying the courtroom he
signals his clerk (English) to him

MAGISTRATE
(whispered conference)
I am going to clear the courtroom

CLERK
(politely)
Im not sure wed be able to And it
is a first hearing its supposed to
be public And hes a lawyer

The magistrate frowns

MAGISTRATE
(worried angry)
I dont know where they found the
nerve for all this

CLERK
Im sure I dont either but the
troops wont be here until tomorrow
MAGISTRATE
How the press get here before the
military

We see the front row from his point of view Two or

three
Indian journalists and one European
CLERK
That English clergyman sent a number
of telegrams yesterday afternoon I
understand one of them even went to
the Viceroy
The magistrate receives that news with some alarm He
indicates that the clerk take his place
Gandhi stands The courtroom is silent but we can
still
hear the sound of the chanting outside
MAGISTRATE
You have been ordered out of the
province on the grounds of disturbing
the peace
GANDHI
(defiantly)
With respect I refuse to go
The magistrate stares The journalists write The clerk
swallows
The magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only
too
aware of the mob outside
MAGISTRATE
(sternly)
Do you want to go to jail
GANDHI
(not giving him an
inch)
As you wish
The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad The magistrate
searches
the distant wall the top of his desk his twitching
hands

MAGISTRATE
(as much sternness as
he can muster)
All right I will release you on
bail of one hundred rupees until I
reach a sentence

GANDHI
I refuse to pay one hundred rupees

Again the magistrate stares And so do the journalists

magistrate wets his lips --

MAGISTRATE
Then I -- I will grant release without
bail -- until I reach a decision

And now the court explodes In the chaos of cheering
delight the magistrate rises looks around the room
heads for his chambers

The journalists are scribbling furiously

Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom We hear
of Gandhi -- Gandhi -- Bapu

THE COURTHOUSE BALCONY

Gandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony A
cheer comes up from the massed peasants below As he

down at them he is turned by

A VOICE
Gandhiji -- Gandhiji Mr Gandhi
Four young Indians -- elegantly dressed in English

are following him having plunged through the crowd in
courtroom A beat -- and the first young man addresses
over the chaos

FIRST YOUNG MAN
(his accent is as
Behind

even

and

refined as his clothes)
Gandhiji -- we are from Bihar We
received a cable this morning from
an old friend who was at Cambridge
with us

(A smile)
His name is Nehru and I believe you
know him

Gandhi reacts -- with surprise and caution

GANDHI
Indeed

FIRST YOUNG MAN
He tells us you need help And we
have come to give it

Again Gandhi is surprised -- but even more cautious
him the crowd begins to chant Gandhi -- Gandhi
GANDHI

I want to document coldly
rationally what is being done here
It may take months -- many many
months

FIRST YOUNG MAN
(theyre eager
impressed)
We have no pressing engagements

It sounds casually ironic but they look determined
angry

GANDHI
You will have to live with the
peasants
(They nod)
I have nothing to pay you
(They only smile)
Hmm

He is looking at them with a soup¢gon of skepticism but
beginning to smell victory His name echoes around him

is taken up even louder as the news spreads to the

GOVERNORS OFFICE - CHAMPARAN - INTERIOR - DAY
Almost total silence The room is long large and

hardwood floors overhead fans an aura of wealth and
permanence Footsteps pace its acres of space and

George Hodge comes into frame He is rich middle-aged
and at the moment feeling impotent and harried
SIR GEORGE
I dont know what this country is
coming to
The Governor Sir Edward Gait -- the portrait of the
prominent behind him -- is feeling as cornered as Sir
but for different reasons His desk is arrayed with
tall stacks of folders -- all with exactly the same
and on one corner of the desk some folded newspapers
can just read Gandhi in a headline He taps one of
folders irritably with his hand
SIR EDWARD

But good God man you yourself raised
the rent simply to finance a hunting

expedition
Sir George looks at him -- half defensive half
They are old friends -- the same school the same
class long together in India -- and their argument is

argument between friend who accept the same premises
even so the Governor feels the game has not quite been
fairly

SIR EDWARD
And some of these others --

folders again)

services without pay even refusing

Sir George is staring out of the window vexed
but defensive

SIR GEORGE
Nobody knows what it is to try to
get these people to work

SIR EDWARD
Well youve make this half-naked
whatever-he-is into an international
hero

He picks up one of the papers irritatedly the London
Chronicle

SIR EDWARD

One lone man marching dusty roads
armed only with honesty and a bamboo
shaft doing battle with the British
Empire

(He lowers the paper

dismally then the

ultimate bitterness)
At home children are writing essays
about him

Sir George looks at him and sighs heavily Sir Edward
back then drops the paper back on his desk
SIR EDWARD

I couldnt take another two years of

him to save my life
Sir George turns and paces back toward him For the
time we see Sir Edwards personal secretary (a male
servant) sitting at a small desk and listening with
developed unobtrusiveness

SIR GEORGE
What do they want

It is the first sign of concession Sir Edward lifts

eyes to his personal secretary
PERSONAL SECRETARY

(reading precisely

from a document)
A rebate on rents paid

(Sir George huffs)
They are to be free to grow crops of
their own choice A commission --
part Indian -- to hear grievances

Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward A beat

SIR GEORGE
(wearily)
That would satisfy him

SIR EDWARD
(a nod then pointedly)
And His Majestys Government It
only needs your signature for the
landlords

Sir George looks at the document on the secretarys

desk A
moment The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing
him
Sir George looks at it like a snake The secretary
picks up
a pen and offers it A second then Sir George takes
the pen
and signs angrily
SIR GEORGE
It will be worth it to see the back
of him
(A flourish at the
end of his signature
then he stands)
Were too damn liberal
Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet
SIR EDWARD
Perhaps But at least all this has
made the Government see some sense
about what men like Mr Gandhi should
be allowed and what they should be
denied
He turns offering Sir George a whiskey in a finely cut
glass

of crystal
SIR EDWARD
(firmly)
Things are going to change

JINNAHS RESIDENCE - BOMBAY - EXTERIOR - DAY
Jinnah moves from under the portico His shining

expensive
car is coming in the drive and stops by him He opens

the
back door but only the chauffeur is in the car
JINNAH
(in annoyance)
Where is Mr Gandhi
CHAUFFEUR
(distastefully)
He said he preferred to walk sir I
followed him most of the way Hes
just turned the corner
Jinnah closes the door and looks across at the entrance
in
exasperation
JINNAH
The Prophet give me patience
CHAUFFEUR
He came Third Class
Its a disdainful comment and he drives the car off
toward
the garage
Gandhi comes around the corner of the wall into the
entrance
He is carrying a bedroll and a bamboo walking stick
Herman

Kallenbach is with him dressed informally also
carrying a
bedroll Jinnah makes a sophisticated salaam

JINNAH
(with effort)
My house is honored

Gandhi grins dismissing the formality

GANDHI
(he makes the pranam)
The honor is ours May I introduce
Mr Kallenbach Hes an old friend
(anticipating Jinnahs
objection)
and his interest is in flowers I
presumed to tell him he could wander
your gardens while we talked

JINNAH
(the suave but
slightly ironic host)
Ill send my gardener Im sure youll
have much to discuss

JINNAHS DRAWING ROOM - INTERIOR - DAY

It is spacious English At the door Jinnah
introduces
Gandhi to the room

JINNAH
Gentlemen -- the hero of Champaran

Again Gandhi grins at the extravagance

GANDHI
Only the stubborn man of Champaran

A polite little laugh Jinnah introduces him

JINNAH
Mr Patel you know
(Patel bows)
Mr Maulana Azad -- a fellow Muslim
recently released from prison

Gandhi makes the pranam studying him with interest
after
that comment Azad gives a gentle salaam

JINNAH
Mr Kripalani
(A bow -- we have
seen him at the
Congress Conference)
And of course you know Mr Nehru

Gandhi turns

Featuring Nehru He stands awaiting Gandhis
attention All
the others have been dressed in European clothes The

handsome
Europeanized Nehru now wears an Indian tunic -- much
like
the one that Gandhi once wore
For a moment Gandhi studies the costume then a broad
smile
GANDHI
(a play on Jinnahs
introduction)
I am beginning to know Mr Nehru
PATEL
(to business Gandhi
has been admitted to
the power circle he
is not the power)
Well Ive called you here because
Ive had a chance to see the new
legislation Its exactly what was
rumored Arrest without warrant
Automatic imprisonment for possession
of materials considered seditious
He looks at Gandhi
PATEL
Your writings are specifically listed
Gandhi nods at the compliment but they are all
angered by

the severity of it

KRIPALANT
So much for helping them in the Great
War

JINNAH
(fire)
There is only one answer to that
Direct action -- on a scale they can
never handle

Again the temper of it produces a little silence Then

NEHRU
I dont think so

He moves to a servant who stands holding a large tray
with
a silver service of tea Of them all Nehrus manner is
the

most naturally patrician and Jinnah watches him with a

somewhat envious awareness of it

NEHRU
Terrorism would only justify their
repression And what kinds of leaders
would it throw up Are they likely
to be the men we would want at the
head of our country

His stand has produced a little shock of surprise
Holding
his tea he turns to Gandhi with a little smile

NEHRU
Ive been catching up on my reading

He means Gandhis of course Jinnah looks at the two of
them

Gandhi has removed his sandals and is sitting cross-
legged

on a fine upholstered chair Jinnahs eyes rake him
with

anger and distaste

JINNAH
(coldly)
I too have read Mr Gandhis writings
but Id rather be ruled by an Indian
terrorist than an English one And I
dont want to submit to that kind of
law

PATEL

(to Nehru --

diplomatically --

but with a trace of

condescension)
I must say Panditji it seems to me
its gone beyond remedies like passive
resistance

GANDHI

(in the silence)
If I may -- I for one have never
advocated passive anything

They all look at him with some surprise As he speaks
he

rises and walks to the servant
fervor

and
it
the
been

pours

they

GANDHI
I am with Mr Jinnah We must never
submit to such laws -- ever And I
think our resistance must be active
and provocative
They all stare at him startled by his words and the
with which he speaks to them
GANDHI
I want to embarrass all those who
wish to treat us as slaves All of
them
He holds their gaze then turns to the immobile servant
with a little smile takes the tray from him and places
on the table next to him It makes them all aware that
servant standing there like an insensate ornament has
treated like a thing a slave As it sinks in Gandhi

some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -

first to Jinnah

GANDHI
Forgive my stupid illustration But
I want to change their minds -- not
kill them for weaknesses we all

possess
It impresses each one of them But for all his impact
still take the measure of him with caution

AZAD
And what resistance would you offer

GANDHI
The law is due to take effect from
April sixth I want to call on the
nation to make that a day of prayer
and fasting

Prayer and fasting They are not overwhelmed

JINNAH

light

You mean a general strike

GANDHI
(his grin)
I mean a day of prayer and fasting
But of course no work could be done --
no buses no trains no factories
no administration The country would
stop

Patel is the first to recognize the implications

PATEL
My God it would terrify them

AZAD
(a wry smile)
Three hundred fifty million people
at prayer Even the English newspapers
would have to report that And explain
why

KRIPALANT
But could we get people to do it

NEHRU
(he is half sold
already)
Champaran stirred the whole country
(To Gandhi)
They are calling you Mahatma -- the
Great Soul

GANDHI
Fortunately such news comes very
slowly where I live

NEHRU
(continuing to the
others)
I think if we all worked to publicize
it all of the Congress every

avenue we know
The idea has caught hold As the others talk of

telegrams speeches

Jinnah looks over his cup at
with an air of bitter resignation but he tries to make

THE GARDEN - VICEROYS PALACE - EXTERIOR - DAY
A garden party in full imperial splendor A military
plays discreetly in the background Princes
generals ranking British civil servants and their
taking tea on the manicured lawns among the exotic
But over all there is a thread of anxiety we pick up
two nervous phrases At the West Gate there were no
at all Of course the Army will always be loyal

the camera picks out a civil servant stepping from a

the palace carrying a sheaf of telegrams and cable

He searches the assembled guests then heads with
indecorous haste toward his target It is the Viceroy
Chelmsford With him talking quietly are his aide-de-
the Governor of the province and his ADC and the
general of the Army in India Lord Chelmsfords ADC is

first to react to the civil servants arrival and his
impatient attendance

ADC
Sir -- its Mr Kinnoch

Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly

CHELMSFORD
Yes
KINNOCH
(hesitant stunned)
Nothing nothing is working sir --
buses trains the markets

(Personal incredulous)
Theres not even any civilian staff
here Sir Everything has stopped

CHELMSFORD
(curt firm)
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay

His firmness doesnt restore Kinnochs normal aplomb
He
holds the telegrams forward

KINNOCH
No sir -- Karachi Calcutta Madras
Bangalore Its its total

He glances at the general

KINNOCH
(the ultimate)
The Army had to take over the
telegraph or wed be cut off from
the world

That takes the wind out of all of them Grimly Lord

Chelmsford looks out across the palaces ordered lawns
and

gardens

CHELMSFORD
I cant believe it

KINNOCH
Hes going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay Theyve called
for a parade -- on Victoria Road

turns to the General)

THE STREETS OF AMRITSAR - EXTERIOR - DAY

The golden dome of the Temple fills the screen

The sound of a car and marching feet The camera pulls

from the dome revealing the rooftops the trees and

suddenly center of frame the face of General Dyer --

cold isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military

He is traveling slowly steadily in an armored car at

head of fifty armed sepoys -- Gurkhas and Baluchis --
immaculate precise awesome Behind them a staff car

Dyers English ADC and a British police officer It is

relentless determined procession filling the dusty

(it makes him a little irritable to have to repeat it)

DYER
Take your time Take your time

He looks off at the crowd His eyes narrow

A group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in

From behind the sepoys we see the whole Bagh littered

THE ARMORY HALL - THE FORT OF LAHORE - INTERIOR - DAY
Silence The camera is close as it crosses a table with

documents Gradually we hear a muffled cough whispers
shuffled papers and it at last comes to a large close

of General Dyer
Another angle A Commission of Inquiry sits in the

Armory Hall of the Old Fort Dyer faces a panel of
Commissioners Lord Hunter presiding Mr Justice

General Barrow a British civil servant and an Indian
barrister

The Commission functions like a public parliamentary

little ceremony no judicial robes a small group of
that

shock at

of

more

and press who sit on wooden chairs behind a barrier
isolates the Commissions business

Much of that public is English -- fellow officers and
civilians

A Government Advocate (English) turns to face Dyer

ADVOCATE
General Dyer is it correct that you
ordered your troops to fire at the
thickest part of the crowd

Dyer glances woodenly at the panel -- a man in some
the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy
praise

DYER
(righteously)
That is so

The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief --
at his attitude than his statement

ADVOCATE
One thousand five hundred and sixteen
casualties with one thousand six
hundred and fifty bullets

A slight reaction from the public section Dyers jaw
tightens

DYER
My intention was to inflict a lesson
that would have an impact throughout
all India

He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a
reasonable point The evasiveness the only half-buried
embarrassment of their response only deepens his own
withdrawal into himself

INDIAN BARRISTER
General had you been able to take
in the armored car would you have
opened fire with the machine gun

Dyer thinks about it Then unashamedly --

A muted reaction from the public section The Indian

stares at him a moment then simply lowers his eyes to

notes
HUNTER
General did you realize there were
children -- and women -- in the crowd
DYER
(a beat)

I did
For the first time there is the hint of uncertainty in
manner

ADVOCATE
But that was irrelevant to the point
you were making

DYER
That is correct

There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed
the panel Not so quickly in the public section

ADVOCATE
Could I ask you what provision you
made for the wounded

Dyer looks at him quickly The question is unexpected

a little clever The officers listening clearly

DYER
(a moment then firmly)
I was ready to help any who applied

And that answer stops the Advocate He smiles dryly

JALLIANWALLAH BAGH - EXTERIOR - DAY

Quiet the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry The
is panning slowly along a section of the wall We are
and see the bullet holes the patches of splashed
scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the
to claw a path to safety And finally the camera

a close shot of Gandhi matching that of Dyer whom we
just left He is surveying the wall in the now empty
numbly desolately

Nehru stands a few feet away from him his mood the
the same benumbed grief and incredulity

Resume the wall -- Gandhis point of view The camera
continues its pan -- bits of human hair matted in the

blood and the bullet-ripped foliage the well

ground around it little pieces of clothing Flies buzz
the debris Abstractedly Gandhi touches the bucket
that lies across the surround Nehru has moved to the
side of the well Gandhi lifts his eyes to him

Featuring the Viceroy Lord Chelmsford

CHELMSFORD
You must understand gentlemen that
His Majestys Government -- and the
British people -- repudiate both the
massacre and the philosophy that
prompted it

Chelmsford is pacing along one side of a large

table Just in front of this is the British side --
generals (a full general and a brigadier) a naval

two senior civil servants a senior police officer
from them is the Indian side Gandhi Nehru Patel
Azad This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with
full authority of a leader

The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsfords disclaimer --
coolly but accepting it That lifts Chelmsfords hopes

little

CHELMSFORD
What I would like to do is to come
to some compromise over the new civil
legis --

GANDHI
If you will excuse me Your
Excellency it is our view that
matters have gone beyond
legislation

It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still
It stops Chelmsford in mid-pace

GANDHI

We think it is time you recognized
that you are masters in someone elses
home

(It chills stiffens

Gandhi proceeds only

an iota softer)
Despite the best intentions of the
all

to

pas

on the

both

trouble

best of you you must in the nature
of things humiliate us to control
us General Dyer is but an extreme

example of the principle

It is time

you left
The British are stunned almost to speechlessness -- the
audacity the impossibility of it -- and from Gandhi of

people The senior civil servant Kinnoch is the first

recover

KINNOCH
With respect Mr Gandhi without
British administration this country
would be reduced to chaos

GANDHI
(patient ironic)
Mr Kinnoch I beg you to accept
that there is no people on earth who
would not prefer their own bad
government to the good government
of an alien power

BRIGADIER
(indignantly choked)
My dear sir -- India is British
Were hardly an alien power

Gandhi and the others just look at him

Chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux

has been made

course he intends

He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of

Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this

CHELMSFORD
Even if His Majesty could waive all
other considerations he has a duty
to the millions of his Muslim subjects
who are a minority in this realm
And experience has taught that his
troops and his administration are
essential in order to keep the peace

and he strives to get the meeting back

Gandhi knows the
this can cause and he answers more for those on his

side
than the Viceroys
GANDHI
All nations contain religious
minorities Like other countries
ours will have its problems
(Flat irrevocable)
But they will be ours -- not yours
Its finality is such that for a moment there is no
response

at all but then the General smiles

GENERAL
And how do you propose to make them
yours You dont think were just
going to walk out of India

His smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the
others on
his side

GANDHI
Yes in the end you will walk out
Because one hundred thousand
Englishmen simply cannot control
three hundred fifty million Indians
if the Indians refuse to co-operate
And that is what we intend to achieve --
peaceful non-violent non-co-
operation

He looks at them all then up at Lord Chelmsford behind

them
GANDHI
Until you yourself see the wisdom of
leaving your Excellency
LATER - THE SAME GOVERNMENT COUNCIL ROOM
Close shot -- a crystal decanter The top is lifted
whiskey
pours
The camera pulls back We are still in the Council
Room but
time has passed The Indian delegation has gone and
the

British are relaxing as a servant pours
GENERAL
(mocking his exchange
with Gandhi)
You dont just expect us to walk
out Yes

And they all laugh

BRIGADIER
Extraordinary little man Nonviolent
non-co-operation -- for a moment I

almost thought they were actually
going to do something

There are some smiles but not all of them are quite so
amused

CHELMSFORD

(thoughtfully)
Yes -- but it would be wise to be
very cautious for a time The Anti-
Terrorist Act will remain on the
statutes but on no account is Gandhi
to be arrested Whatever mischief he
causes I have no intention of making
a martyr of him

It is an instruction they all find correct
FIELD - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

A roar of approval from a huge crowd We are featuring

two

British soldiers their faces partially lit by a
flickering

torch light that reveals their tense wariness

Another angle And we can see its cause A huge crowd
is

gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through
it --

and their mood is confident belligerent As their
defiant

roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi
sits

cross-legged on the platform Nehru is with him Patel
now

for the first time in an Indian tunic and Azad also
in an

Indian tunic Desai Gandhis new male secretary is
with
them But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone

who
has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd
BA
(simple direct)
but now something worse is
happening When Gandhiji and I were
growing up women wove their own
cloth But now there are millions
who have no work because those who
can buy all they need from England
I say with Gandhiji there is no
beauty in the finest cloth if it
makes hunger and unhappiness
It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam
and
turns away There is applause and noise but Ba does
not
acknowledge it she simply sits cross-legged behind
Gandhi
who is talking with Patel and Nehru At last he rises
and
the noise and applause increase to something like
chaos
In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on
the
perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more
wary
by the enthusiasm of this greeting Gandhi fiddles with
his
glasses preoccupied finally he looks out over the
crowd
and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually
but
quite definitely the crowd stills
GANDHI
My message tonight is the message I
have given to your brothers
everywhere To gain independence we
must prove worthy of it
We intercut with the crowd listening raptly Gandhi
holds

up one finger

GANDHI
There must be Hindu-Muslim unity --
always
reaction

lets

gesture

out

edge

(A second finger)
Secondly no Indian must be treated
as the English treat us so we must
remove untouchability from our lives
and from our hearts

Neither of these goals is easy and the audience
shows it Now Gandhi raises a third finger

GANDHI
Third -- we must defy the British

And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause Gandhi
it run for a time then stills it with the one small
as before

GANDHI
Not with violence that will inflame
their will but with firmness that
will open their eyes

This has sobered the audience somewhat Now he looks
across them as though seeking something Then

GANDHI

English factories make the cloth --
that makes our poverty

(A reaction)
All those who wish to make the English
see bring me the cloth from
Manchester and Leeds that you wear
tonight and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi -- and
London

There is an excited stir he silences it

GANDHI
And if like me you are left with
only one piece of homespun -- wear

it with dignity

trousers are flung into a pile

ASHRAM STATION - EXTERIOR - DAY

The small train station near the ashram Kallenbach

by a new (early 1920s) Ford touring car watching as a
pulls into the station

As people start to jump off the train he moves forward
Featuring Patel getting out of a compartment marked
Class He lugs a bedroll and a bag Despite the Indian

he now wears he cannot help but look and act like the
incisive patrician lawyer he is under the skin As he

through the crowded platform

PATEL
Excuse me -- just let me get out of
your way please
(Someone reaches for
his bedroll and bag)
No thank you Ill manage

He looks up it is Kallenbach who is the insistent

PATEL

(joyous -- its been

a long time)
Ah Herman

(Of the bags)
No no -- dont destroy my good
intentions Im feeling guilty about
traveling Second Class
again

see
is

with two

him

Kallenbach is smiling too He reaches for the bags

KALLENBACH
I do it as a friend -- and admirer --
not a servant

PATEL
Ah in that case

And grandly he relinquishes the bags and looks back

PATEL
Maulana is made of sterner stuff
Our trains met in Bombay but hes
back there in that lot somewhere

Their point of view In the chaos of the Third Class we
Maulana Azad coming out of a section of the coach He
carrying a baby wrapped in rags The childs mother
little ones hanging on her has followed him out

PATELS VOICE-OVER
There he is -- out Gandhi-ing Gandhi

Azad hands the woman the baby and she obviously thanks

He makes a little salaam to her and moves through the
confusion of the platform toward the camera

Resume Patel and Kallenbach

PATEL
(shaking his head at
it all)
When I think what our beloved
Mahatma asks I dont know how he
ever got such a hold over us Is he
back

KALLENBACH
Yes Now that things are moving hes
going to write and only take part
when its necessary

Azad approaches them

AZAD

grinning

She

It was a Hindu child and it tried to
wet on me

He and Kallenbach clasp with their free hands both

PATEL
Of course A Muslim beef eater --
Im only surprised he missed

AZAD
He was a she

PATEL
Ah that explains it
(He grins)
Well do I carry your luggage as
penance or --

KALLENBACH
Theres another passenger -- a Miss
Slade
(He turns

automatically as
Patel and Azad do
toward the First
Class section)
Shes the daughter of an English
admiral
(Patel and Azad look
back at him in quick
surprise Kallenbach
smiles)
Shes been corresponding with him
for a year

And the camera pans with their glances at they look
with real interest toward the First Class coach
Porters are unloading the baggage of two or three

here and helping some others (English and Indian) to

In the foreground we see a tall Indian woman in a red
Farther along there is a large stack of luggage being

to by a porter An English woman is hovering about it
is well dressed but rather dreary and unprepossessing

and
the camera zooms in toward her
PATEL
And what does the daughter of an
English admiral propose to do in an
ashram -- sink us
AZAD
(quietly -- his manner)
From the looks of the luggage yes
Patel grins Like most witty men he loves wit in
others
KALLENBACH
She wants to make her home with us --
and Gandhiji has agreed
Patel groans They turn back to the train and just as
they
do the tall Indian woman in the red sari tips a
porter
taking one small bag from him and turns Mirabehn
(Madeleine
Slade) is tall quite pretty and extremely English
despite
the sari The minute she turns she stops on seeing the
now
startled Kallenbach
MIRABEHN
Youd be Mr Kallenbach
Kallenbach recovers sufficiently to --
KALLENBACH
And you would be Miss Slade
MIRABEHN
(proudly)
I prefer the name Gandhiji has given
me -—- Mirabehn
The word means daughter Patel and Azad stare at each
other

in something like bafflement

THE ROAD TO THE ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY
An ox labors along in harness We follow him for a

moment
then move along the traces of the harness to the Ford
touring
car that it is pulling In the car Kallenbach and
Mirabehn
sit in the front seat Patel and Azad in the back
Closer
KALLENBACH
(of the car)
It was a gift and it only worked a
few weeks but when Gandhi came home
he struck on this idea He calls it
his ox-Ford Comfortable -- and yet
more our pace
He does what little steering is necessary and Mirabehn
smiles
at it all finding everything delightful She peers
ahead in

the direction of the distant ashram

MIRABEHN
Might Mr Nehru be there too

PATEL
(glibly)
The irresponsible young Nehru is in
prison -- again Though there is a
rumor that under pressure from your
country they will let him out --
again

Mirabehn has turned to look at him She has the same
sophomoric eagerness and intensity as the young Gandhi

MIRABEHN
You cant know how closely we follow
your struggle --
(to Patel personally)
how many in England admired what you
did in Bardoli It must have taken
enormous courage

PATEL
Well in this country one must decide
if one is more afraid of the
government or Gandhi
(Of Azad Kallenbach
and himself)
For us its Gandhi

Mirabehn is enthralled by the wit the modesty that

underlines
the words She faces Kallenbach
MIRABEHN
(a note of wonder)
And youre German
KALLENBACH
Yes
MIRABEHN
And do you feel Indian
She thinks she does and that he would want to
KALLENBACH
No
It surprises but it doesnt deflate
MIRABEHN
But youve been with him so long --
why
Kallenbach whose size and stillness carry the aura of
some
great piece of primitive sculpture -- solid true
disturbingly profound -- searches inside himself for
the
answer
KALLENBACH
-Id come to believe I would never
meet a truly honest man And then I
met one
It is so profoundly simple and deeply felt that it
obviously
touches the deeply emotional Mirabehn
GANDHIS BUNGALOW - EXTERIOR - DAY
Ba has a spinning wheel on the small porch and Gandhi
is
sitting next to her with another He is trying to
imitate
her action -- which is fast and dexterous -- and he
gets in

a terrible jumble Ba watches laughing

BA
Stop -- stop

She leans across and tries to extricate his fingers

BA
God gave you ten thumbs

GANDHI
(morosely)
Eleven

And Ba laughs again and Gandhi smiles tapping her with
playful reproval on the top of her bent head There are
footsteps and Gandhi looks up Patel stands in the

Gandhis face changes to something like elation A

GANDHI
Sardar

It means leader and it is the name the peasants have

Patel Gandhi uses it with an intonation of novelty and
respect He stands and crosses to Patel clutching him
emotionally and it brings a bit of emotion from the
sophisticated Patel

Gandhi holds him back to look at him

GANDHI
What youve done is a miracle You
have made all India proud

Patel gets hold of himself and affects his usual glib
cynicism

PATEL
It must have been the only Non-violent
campaign ever led by a man who wanted
to kill everybody every day

GANDHI
(laughs)
Not true
(He means himself)
The secret is mastering the urge

He smiles again then his arm still around Patels
sees
then
kissing

top of

Patels

they
the

spinning

he turns to greet the others Azad looks at him then
facetiously as though to put down Patel

AZAD
He came Second Class

Gandhi laughs again squeezing Patels shoulder

GANDHI
Well we cant expect miracles all
the time
(Then to Azad more
soberly)
Your news I understand is not so
good
Azad shakes his head
AZAD

No
Gandhi reaches forward and touches his hand and he
Mirabehn on the porch For a moment their eyes meet and
Mirabehn moves forward quickly and takes his hand
it tears running down her cheek Gandhi touches the
her head

GANDHI

Come come -- you will be my

daughter
LATER - GANDHIS BUNGALOW - INTERIOR - TWILIGHT
The camera is on a row of sandals by the door --
Azads Desais Gandhis It pans to the room Gandhi
facing Patel and Azad Desai in the background making
of the discussion Gandhi is carding fiber to thread as
talk Mirabehn seated like the others is almost in
circle sitting near Ba and listening like her Bas
never stops

AZAD
but then some rioting broke out
between Hindus and Muslims -- violent
terrible

Gandhi looks up at Azad Azad shakes his head solemnly

AZAD

Whether it was provoked

(he shrugs a hint of

suspicion)
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal

(He looks at Gandhi

shaking his head

grimly)
Some of the things the military have
done

But he does not go on It has a terrible sobriety

GANDHI
Is the campaign weakening

Azad shakes his head

AZAD
The marches and protests are bigger
if anything but with the censorship
here
(a nod toward Mirabehn)
they know more in England than we
do and it saps the courage to think
you may be suffering alone

Gandhi reaches out and touches his hand

GANDHI

They are not alone And martial law
only shows how desperate the British
are

He holds Azads eyes giving strength Then he turns to

Mirabehn made more aware of her by Azads reference
For a

moment he looks at her sari

GANDHI
Is that homespun Or cotton from
Leeds

The tone suggests he thinks it is homespun Mirabehn
nods a
spinning

then at

her

little choked that his attention is turned to her

MIRABEHN
I -- I sent for it from here I
dyed it myself

Gandhi smiles approvingly Then a shadow --

GANDHI
What do the workers in England make
of what were doing It must have
produced hardship

Mirabehn beams

MIRABEHN
It has But youd be surprised They
understand -- they really do Its
not the workers you have to worry
about

GANDHI
Good
(A glance toward Ba)
Ba will have to teach you to spin
too

MIRABEHN
I would rather march

GANDHI
First spin Let the others march for
a time

Mirabehn nods and looks resignedly at Ba Ba is
She smiles
BA
First lesson To march wear shoes
to spin do not

Mirabehn looks down at the shoes on her feet -- and

the others and their bare feet -- and she looks up in
grinning self-conscious embarrassment Ba smiles at

affectionately

CHAURI CHAURA - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

A small town Featuring the faces of six Indian police
constables as a torch light parade passes them There

enough of them in their group to be watching the
with a challenging disdain The marchers are men in
clothes and tunics they brandish torn and ripped
cloth and shout in unison
MARCHERS

Indian Long live Gandhi
We have cut to the parade -- and it is the tail end
around a corner ahead Some of the marchers wave their

tauntingly at the police One policeman suddenly steps

and grabs at a piece of cloth waved at him He pulls it
viciously from the marcher

POLICEMAN
Ill stuff your damn mouth with it

He chases the marcher and boots him with his foot

marcher runs at the policeman swinging at him with his

of cloth
SECOND MARCHER
Leave him alone -- he wasnt harming

The crowd surges around it smashing windows hurling

At the door of the flaming building One policeman

JINNAHS DRAWING ROOM - INTERIOR - DAY
Close shot -- Gandhi His face drawn stunned as he
emptily at the floor He is sitting on the carpet in
center of the room A moment of silence and then we
hear the tick of a clock the sounds of others moving
room and finally
PATELS VOICE

Thats one bit of news they havent

censored
Another angle Patel leans with one arm on a table his
as devastated as Gandhis he is looking at an Indian
on the table by his hand A moment then

JINNAHS VOICE
Oh its all over the world
(ironically)
Indias non-violence

He has been standing looking out of a window He

tosses a newspaper on a desk It is a New York Times
just glimpse the picture of the severed head lying in

the
smoldering ashes
And now we see Nehru and Azad in the background too
And
Desai Jinnah as usual in a finely cut European suit
the
others are dressed in tunics of homespun as they will
be to
the end
NEHRU
(bleakly)
What can we do
GANDHI
(sepulchrally)
We must end the campaign
They turn to him -- a sense of surprise but they dont
really
believe he means the statement
JINNAH
After what they did at the massacre --
its only an eye for an eye
GANDHI
(he hasnt moved the
same tone)
An eye for an eye only ends up making
the whole world blind
(Now he looks up at
them )
We must stop
PATEL
(a baffled smile)
Gandhiji -- do you know the sacrifices
people have made
He looks at him Gandhi doesnt move Patel looks up
hopelessly at Jinnah Azad keeps his eyes fixed on
Gandhi

sensing fearing what is going to happen

JINNAH
We would never get the same commitment
again -- ever

He looks at Gandhi with a mounting sense of annoyance
helpless

too

danger

Gandhi is listening but still withdrawn into himself

GANDHI
If we obtain our freedom by murder
and bloodshed I want no part of it

NEHRU
(pleading)
It was one incident

GANDHI
(quietly)
Tell that to the families of the
policemen who died

Jinnah turns away in anger Patel sighs Nehru feels

but he continues to try

NEHRU
Bapu -- the whole nation is marching
They wouldnt stop even if we asked
them to
Gandhi stares into nothing -- mulling that Finally
GANDHI

I will ask And I will fast as penance
for my part in arousing such emotions --
and I will not stop until they stop

Nehru stares at him -- surprised Azad is not
JINNAH
(disgustedly)

God You can be sure the British

wont censor that Theyll put it on

every street corner
Gandhi does not react And Nehru ignores the thought
because like Azad his mind is already on the real

She removes her sandals and walks across the room

looking back
Mirabehn bends and sits by Gandhis side
MIRABEHN
Ive brought your drinking water
May I turn you
Gandhi struggles to turn and Mirabehn helps him When
turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the
heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he
stop them She looks at him nervously then pours a
from the pitcher
MIRABEHN
There is a little lemon juice in it
That is all
She turns back and propping up his head helps him to

Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru --
there was a telegram Almost
everywhere it has stopped
Gandhi swallows with difficulty He pauses letting his
fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again He

will be answered

GANDHI
Do you find me stubborn

Kallenbach

MIRABEHN
(her own honesty)
I dont know I know you are right
I dont know that this is right

Gandhi signals her down to him She bends so she is
at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear

GANDHI
(hoarse strained)
When I despair I remember that all
through history the way of truth and
love has always won

We intercut their faces very close as he speaks

GANDHI
There have been tyrants and murderers
and for a time they can seem
invincible But in the end they always
fall Think of it -- always When
you are in doubt that that is Gods
way the way the world is meant to
be think of that

During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face

him touched with emotion

GANDHI
(the paternal smile)
And then -- try to do it His way

(A tear runs down

Mirabehns face She

touches his shoulder

Gandhi just leans

his head back in

exhaustion)
And now -- could I have another feast

Later The Advocate General is speaking from a folded

Non-co-operation has one aim
the overthrow of the Government
Sedition must become our creed We
must give no quarter nor can we

(He looks up at Gandhi)
Signed M K Gandhi in your journal

GANDHI

Not at all

And I will save the Courts time

rule of India is evil

JUDGE BROOMFIELD
I take it you will conduct your own

GANDHI
I have no defense My Lord I am
guilty as charged

(Then testingly)

And if you truly believe in the system
of law you administer in my country
you must inflict on me the severest
penalty possible

It is almost a cruel challenge to the obviously humane
Broomfield

The reporters scribble watching the Judge even as they
because the mere doubt in the Judges face reflects on
whole position of the British to India
Featuring Judge Broomfield He lowers his glasses
staring at them for a moment
JUDGE BROOMFIELD
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you are in a different category
from any person I have ever tried
or am likely to try
He looks up at Gandhi and his own respect for him is
poignantly manifest
JUDGE BROOMFIELD

it is his face that shows the respect
INDIAN ROAD - EXTERIOR - DAY

they hoped Put him in prison a few

years and with luck hed be forgotten

And maybe theyd even subdue him
We see from Walkers point of view an Indian woman

India Everybody knows another
showdowns coming -- but when and
over what --

He shrugs Nobody knows

WALKER
Well I read you account of that
crowd in Calcutta and that he was
twisting the Lions tail again

Collins has suddenly slowed the car then swerves
pair of elephants hauling logs

WALKER
(falteringly)
and I knew something had to give

And I was determined to be here when
it did

COLLINS
How does a reporter in Central America
learn that Gandhi was born in
Porbandar anyway

WALKER
Oh Ive been a Gandhi buff for a
long time

Collins glances at him in surprise as he steers the car
another procession of camels heading toward the port

COLLINS
He certainly makes good copy
(A laugh)
The other day Winston Churchill called
him that half-naked Indian fakir

Walker smiles too but it soon passes

WALKER
I met him once
Collins looks at him in real surprise

COLLINS
You mean Gandhi

WALKER
(nods)
Back in South Africa
(reflectively)
long time ago

COLLINS
What was he like

WALKER
Lots of hair and a little like a
college freshman -- trying to figure
everything out

Another angle featuring Walker and Collins who are
sitting
alone in the cool shadows of the temple watching with
fascination as Gandhi and Ba repeat their marriage
ceremony
for them Walker jotting notes occasionally but his
eyes

always glued to Gandhi and Ba who are in part lost in
memories and echoes of a significance only they can
know
GANDHI

THE BAY - PORBANDAR - EXTERIOR - DAWN
A tiny beautiful city rising steeply out of the
with tall thick-walled buildings half-fortresses
homes their white walls tinted amber and gold now by

early light of the sun

Featuring Gandhi sitting on a promontory watching the
in solemn meditation He becomes aware of the sound
of

footsteps and he turns to see Walker approaching a
little

knapsack over his shoulder Gandhi smiles Walker comes
to

his side looking out over the bay and city truly
impressed

WALKER
Its beautiful

GANDHI
Even as a boy I thought so

Walker looks down at him Gandhi scowls up in the early
light

WALKER
Trying to keep track of you is making
me change all my sleeping habits

Gandhi smiles

GANDHI
And youve come all this way because
you think something is going to
happen

WALKER
Hm
(Then weightedly)
Is it

GANDHI
Perhaps Ive come here to think
about it

They both watch the waves beat on the shore a moment
the

changing hues of the sunrise on the whites of
Porbandar

GANDHI
(musing)
Do you remember much of South Africa

WALKER
A great deal

GANDHI
Ive traveled so far -- and thought
Walkers

middle

become

fora

with

so much
(He smiles in self-
mockery and turns
toward the city)
As you can see my city was a sea

city -- always filled with Hindus
and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and
Persians

(He looks at Walker)
The temple where you were yesterday
is of my familys sect the Pranami
It was Hindu of course but the priests
used to read from the Muslim Koran
and the Hindu Gita moving from one
to the other as though it mattered
not at all which book was read as
long as God was worshipped

He looks out to sea and we intercut his face with
the sea and the town itself as the sun turns it white

GANDHI

When I was a boy I used to sing a
song in that temple A true disciple
knows anothers woes as his own He
bows to all and despises none
Earthly possessions hold him not
Like all boys I said the words not
thinking of what they meant or how
they might be influencing me

(He looks at Walker

then out to the sea

again shaking his

head)
Ive traveled so far and all Ive
done is come back home

Walker studies him as this profound man reaches in his

years a profound insight

Featuring Gandhi staring out to sea his mind locked in
reflection and suddenly his head lifts his eyes

alert he is caught by some excitement which he weighs
moment then he stands his manner suddenly tingling

optimism
looking

baffled

Walker stares at him then at what Gandhi seems to be
at

His point of view The waves lapping the shore below

Walker turns back to Gandhi puzzled But there is no
mistaking the sudden glow in Gandhis face

WALKER
You know what youre going to do

Gandhi looks at him a teasing smile

GANDHI
It would have been very uncivil of
me to let you make such a long trip
for nothing

The grin broadens and then he starts briskly down the
promontory Walker scrambles up after him

WALKER
Where are you going

Gulls fly over them squawking in the growing light

pauses looking up at the gulls then back down to the

GANDHI
Im going back to the ashram

and then Im going to prove to the
new Viceroy that the Kings writ no

Walker glances at the sea at him then hurries after

Close shot -- the Viceroy a new one Lord Irwin

IRWIN
Salt
Another angle He is looking in astonishment at his

principal
secretary His ADC a general a brigadier a senior
police
officer are with him Like him they hold the same
offices
but are a new team
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY
Yes sir He is going to march to
the sea and make salt
Irwin looks at him still trying to penetrate the
significance
of the act The senior police officer helps
SENIOR POLICE OFFICER
There is a Royal Monopoly on the
manufacture of salt sir Its illegal
to make it or sell it without a
Government license
Irwin has listened its beginning to make a little
sense

IRWIN
All right -- hes breaking the law
What will he be depriving us of two
rupees of salt tax

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY
Its not a serious attack on the
revenue sir Its primary importance
is symbolic

IRWIN
Dont patronize me Charles

The principal secretary blanches

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY
No sir I -- in this climate sir
nothing lives without water -- or
salt Our absolute control of it is
a control on the pulse of India

Irwin looks at his ADC then paces a bit pondering it

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER
Yes sir The day he sets off everyone
is supposed to raise the flag of
Free India Then he walks some two
hundred and forty miles to the sea
and makes salt

A moment as Irwin considers it then it is the general
speaks
GENERAL
I say ignore it Let them raise their
damn flags let him make his salt
Its only symbolic if we choose to

make it so

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY
(pointedly)
Hes going to arrive at the sea on
the anniversary of the massacre at
Amritsar
Irwin has turned to him And this makes up his mind
IRWIN
General Edgar is right -- ignore it
Mr Gandhi will find its going to
take a great deal more than a pinch
of salt to bring down the British
Empire
He is concerned enough to be angry but certain enough
dogmatic

Gandhi grins looking at Mirabehn who is massaging his

Gandhi looks at Nehru a benign shrug
GANDHI

Nehru smiles He stands having taken the last proof

Azad rises with him

NEHRU
We must get these to the printer

I know it will succeed Even my mother

assistant) with a knapsack over his own shoulders

around the edge of the bungalow heading toward the
of the ashram
A long line of ashramites and marchers stretches from
the flagpole to the entrance of the ashram As Gandhi
briskly along it they turn ready to follow him
When he nears the entrance Gandhi sees Walker standing
front of a collection of newsmen cameramen a newsreel
He begins to smile Walker returns it Gandhi pauses by

Long live Mahatma Gandhi

Gandhi passes the cameramen and starts along the trail
THE PATH TO GANDHIS ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

A thinner crowd here but going all along the path To
side we see two police cars drawn up and several

(a British officer a British sergeant and four Indian
constables) lined up near them

As Gandhi nears them Walker moves up beside him Some
newspaper cameramen trot behind to get the picture of
arrest Among the newsmen we see Collins

glancing ahead at the police who are now quite near

if they dont react at all

Gandhi glances at him Walker too wears a knapsack
nods to it though never breaking his pace

GANDHI

Do you still have your notebook

(Walker fumbles for

it Gandhi goes right

on talking)
The function of a civil resister is
to provoke response And we will
continue to provoke until they
respond or they change the law

They are not in control -- we are
That is the strength of civil
resistance

He nods politely toward the British police officer at
end of the police line Walker stops letting the
march on by him looking at the British police officer
writing busily in his notebook Collins stop by him

weve even arrested Nehrus mother

PRINCIPAL SECRETARY

Has there been any violence

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

(distracted offhand)

Oh in Karachi the police fired ona
crowd and killed a couple of people

and --
(and this hurts)

and in Peshawar the Deputy Police
Commissioner lost his head and

and opened fire with a machine gun

(He looks up at them
quickly defensively)

But hes facing a disciplinary court

You cant expect things like that

not to happen when --
IRWIN
(dryly)
I believe the question was intended
to discover if there was any violence
of their side

The senior police officer looks up realizing his gaffe

and
wishes desperately he could relive the last couple of
minutes

Machiavellian mind)
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi it
might --
He means incite violence The Viceroy ponders it --
favorably
IRWIN

officer)

Hes addressed this letter directly

SENIOR POLICE OFFICER
Yes sir he has The usual -- Indias
salt belongs to India -- but then he
says flatly that he personally is
going to lead a raid tomorrow on the
Dharasana Salt Works

IRWIN

Thank him for his letter and put
him in jail

The senior police officer is brought up by the chill
directness of it He looks at Irwin and the principal

Yes sir
DHARASANA SALT WORKS - EXTERIOR - DAY
Barbed wire stretches on either side of the stockade-
entrance Above the gate we see the sign DHARASANA SALT
Before it six British police officers and two Indian
officers command a large troop of Indian policemen
face their opposition unmoving tense The camera pans
them across a sloping dip in the ground to a huge
volunteers lining up to face the police as tautly as
police face them
Walker is off to one side climbing to stand in the

Collins car He watches looking tensely from one

the other almost terrified by what seems about to

Collins leans against the back of the car near him
with an equally appalled expectancy There are two
reporters near them

From Walkers point of view We see Mirabehn and some
women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages
a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed
Walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the

Works entrance We hear only a shuffle of feet the
a lathi against a metal police buckle The air itself
seems
breathless with tension

Featuring Azad He has approached the chief police
officer
He stops before him politely

AZAD
I would like admission to the Works

CHIEF POLICE OFFICER
(equally politely)
I am sorry sir That cannot be
allowed

Azad looks at him a second then glances at the troops
He

is clearly afraid but there is an air of tragic
inevitability

in his face

He moves back to address the volunteers

AZAD

Last night they took Gandhiji from
us They expect us to lose heart or
to fight back We will not lose heart
we will not fight back In his name
we will be beaten As he has taught
us we will not raise a hand Long
live Mahatma Gandhi

He turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and
the
waiting lathis of the police

A series of shots as Azad leads the first row of
volunteers
down and up the dip

We intercut Walker frozen watching the inevitable
onslaught

first

And with the volunteers a foot from them the police

with their lathis A groan of empathic anguish from the
waiting volunteers but then we get A series of shots

next row moves forward and the horror of the one-sided
proceeds heads are cracked faces split ribs smashed
yet one row of volunteers follows another and another
the unrelenting police who knock bleeding bodies out
way down into the dip swing till sweat pours from
faces and bodies
And through it we intercut with Mirabehn and the Indian
rescuing the wounded carrying them on stretchers to be
bandaged We see Walker helping once or twice turning
watching torn between being a professional spectator
normal human being And always the volunteers coming
stopping never offering resistance
And finally on sound there is an insistent click
click like a thud of the lathis but becoming clearly
slap of an impatient hand on a telephone cradle and out
the carnage of the salt works we dissolve to
A SMALL INDIAN STORE - INTERIOR - TWILIGHT
Close shot -- a telephone cradle being pounded
Walker is at the phone at a table in the corner of the
cluttered store His clothes are matted with blood and
WALKER
(into the phone)
Hello Ed Ed Goddammit dont cut
me off
(Then suddenly hes

through)
Ed Okay -- yeah -- right
And he continues urgently reading the story that lies

on his
notes on the little stand before him
WALKER
They walked with heads up without
music or cheering or any hope of
escape from injury or death
(His voice is taut
harshly professional)
It went on and on and on Women
carried the wounded bodies from the
ditch until they dropped from
exhaustion But still it went on
He shifts the mangled notes and comes to his last
paragraph
He speaks it trying only half successfully to keep the
emotion
from his voice
WALKER
Whatever moral ascendance the West
held was lost today India is free
for she has taken all that steel and
cruelty can give and she has neither
cringed nor retreated
(On Walker close His
sweating blood and
dirt-stained face
near tears)
In the words of his followers Long

GANDHIS VOICE

(continuing over all)
I think your interest and the worlds
has fallen on India not only because
we are struggling for freedom but
because the way we are doing so is
unique as far as history shows us
Here in Europe mighty nations are
it seems already contemplating
another war though I think they
and all the world are sick to death
of bloodspilling All of us are
seeking a way out and I flatter
myself that perhaps the ancient land
of India will offer such a way If
we are to make progress we must not
repeat history but make history
And I myself will die before I betray
our belief that love is a stronger
weapon than hate

and Kripalani Desai and Pyarelal are inconspicuously
attendance as always Pyarelal now clearly sharing
role as secretary

JINNAH
So the truth is after all your
travels all your efforts theyve
stopped the campaign and sent you
home empty-handed

He is in his white suit the black-ribboned pince-nez
sits on a wicker chair Nehru and Patel lean against

railing Azad and Kripalani sit on the floor like

GANDHI
They are only clinging to old dreams
(looks up from his
spinning to Jinnah)
and trying to split us in the old
way But the will has gone --
Independence will drop like a ripe
apple The only question is when

Jinnah)
and how
NEHRU
I say when is now -- and we will

determine how

JINNAH
Precisely

Gandhi winds up what he has done and starts to rise
GANDHI
They are preparing for war I will
not support it but I do not intend
to take advantage of their danger

PATEL
(blithely but to the
point)
Thats when you take advantage

Gandhi has moved toward the steps He stops and looks

at
Patel A wry gentle smile
GANDHI
No That is just another way of
striking back We have come a long
way together with the British When
they leave we want to see them off

lieutenant and his passenger is a woman dressed in an
War Correspondents uniform (Margaret Bourke-White) As

Theyve got most of the leading
Congress politicians in this one
But Nehru and some others are over
in Dehra Dun Your timings pretty
lucky They had your Mr Gandhi cut
off from the press but last month
his personal secretary died and
theyve let up on the restrictions

Bourke-White just absorbs it staring at the palace
in the experience with the appetite of her breed and
own particular sensitivity
GANDHIS ROOM - AGA KHANS PALACE - INTERIOR - DAY
Gandhi sits by the window that is grilled rather than
He is spinning in a shaft of light -- and looking off -
we hear a camera click and the rustle of movement His
only half-gray in London is now white
GANDHI
Yes I have heard of Life Magazine
(A smile)
I have even heard of Margaret Bourke-
White But I dont know why either
should be interested in an old man
sitting in prison when the world is
blowing itself to pieces
Bourke-White -- who has been moving crouching to shoot
and the light -- sags back against the wall relaxing
last She has a smile as penetrating and warming as

WALL AND YARD - AGA KHANS PALACE - EXTERIOR - DAY
Gandhi walks along Bourke-White loping along beside
little distance away listening but searching too for
angle a moment that is right
GANDHI
No -- prison is rather agreeable to
me and there is no doubt that after
the war independence will come My
only worry is what shape it will

take Jinnah has --

BOURKE-WHITE
Stop

She has Gandhi in the foreground a soldier on the wall
and behind him

BOURKE-WHITE
Now go on -- just as you were

Gandhi shrugs but suffers it We feature him low from
point of view as he walks on the soldier pacing on
wall in the background
BOURKE-WHITE
(coaching)

what shape it will take Jinnah
has -- what

GANDHI
(at first disconcerted
but then flowing)
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with
the British It has given him power
and the freedom to speak and he has
filled the Muslims with fears of
what will happen to them in a country
that is predominantly Hindu

(He stops lowering

his head gravely)
That I find hard to bear -- even in
prison

She clicks
WALLED GARDEN IN THE PALACE - EXTERIOR - DAY
A spinning wheel works rapidly The camera lifts

Gandhi is
at the wheel and he is smiling off at Bourke-White who

is
trying ineptly to imitate him on another spinning
wheel The
garden they are in has gone to seed a bit but with
latticed
fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass
and
shrubs it is still beautiful
BOURKE-WHITE
(archly but
emphatically of the
spinning)
I do not see it as the solution of
the twentieth centurys problems
Shes grinning at her own frustration and she keeps
trying
but theres no doubt she means it Gandhis smile
broadens
Wryly he lifts his own product -- a tiny roll of
thread
GANDHI
I have a friend who keeps telling me
how much it costs him to keep me in
poverty
And they both laugh a guard on the wall distantly
looks

at them wonderingly

GANDHI
(a bit more seriously)
But I know happiness does not come
with things -- even twentieth century
things It can come from work and
pride in what you do

(He looks at her

steadily)
It will not necessarily be progress
for India if she simply imports the
unhappiness of the West

And she responds to the sophistication of that

observation

He pivots around moving beside her and slowly
demonstrates

the process taking her hands guiding her Bourke-
White

watches him as much as the wheel

BOURKE-WHITE
But do you really believe you could
use non-violence against someone
like Hitler

GANDHI
(a thoughtful pause)
Not without defeats -- and great

pain

(He looks at her)

But are there no defeats in this war --
no pain

(For a moment the

thought hangs and

then Gandhi takes

their hands back to

the spinning)

What you cannot do is accept
injustice From Hitler -- or anyone
You must make the injustice visible --
be prepared to die like a soldier to
do so

And he smiles a little wisely at her

BOURKE-WHITE
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped
around that

GANDHI
(laughs)
No That is what you get for
distracting me

BOURKE-WHITE
What do you expect when you talk
like that
GANDHI
(trying to unravel
the mess)
I expect you to show as much patience
as I am now

His tone is not altogether patient She looks at him in
surprise and he sighs tolerantly Then reflectively

GANDHI

Every enemy is a human being -- even
the worst of them And he believes
he is right and you are a beast

(And now a little

smile)
And if you beat him over the head
you will only convince him But you
suffer to show him that he is wrong
your sacrifice creates an atmosphere
of understanding -- if not with him
then in the hearts of the rest of
the community on whom he depends

Bourke-White looks at him and there is enough sense in
this
argument to give her pause

GANDHI

If you are right you will win --
after much pain

(He looks at her

then smiles in his

own ironic way)
If you are wrong well then only
you will suffer the blows

She stares at him and we know she thinks him much more
profound than she had thought initially

BA AND MIRABEHNS ROOM - AGA KHANS PALACE - INTERIOR -
NIGHT

Ba Mirabehn and Bourke-White sit on straw mats around
the

room an oil lamp is the only light It is womens
talk but

Ba is defending her husband speaking simply but with
total

conviction
--not at all Bapu has always said
there were two kinds of slavery in
India -- one for women one for the
untouchables -- and he has always
fought against both

Bourke-White accepts it at face value She opens

another
line of inquiry
BOURKE-WHITE
Does it rankle being separated from
him this way
Ba pauses
BA
Yes but we see each other in the
day
BOURKE-WHITE
(delicately)
But not at night
Shes terribly curious but she doesnt want to offend
Ba
sees both the curiosity and the hesitancy She smiles
across

at Mirabehn then

BA

In Hindu philosophy the way to God
is to free yourself of possessions --
and the passions that inflame to
anger and jealousy

(A smile)
Bapu has always struggled to find
the way to God

BOURKE-WHITE

You mean he -- he gave up --
(how to phrase it
finally)

married life
Again Ba smiles

BA
Four times he tried -- and failed
(Mirabehn and Bourke-
White grin The older
woman gives a wistful
smile)
But then he took a solemn vow

She shrugs the implication is it was a long time
ago
BOURKE-WHITE
And he has never broken it
BA

Not yet
She looks at them soberly and then they all burst into
laughter like girls

Jinnah stands by one of the great pillars of the
portico It is a break in their Independence

as he lights a cigarette a weary Gandhi approaches him
Azad Jinnahs anger is clearly too deep to be left at
conference table He slaps his lighter shut and

Gandhi in hushed but fiercely felt words

JINNAH
I dont give a damn for the
independence of India I am concerned
about the slavery of Muslims

Nehru and Patel are approaching from the conference
both of them looking worn and angry too Jinnah raises
voice deliberately so Nehru will hear

JINNAH
I will not sit by to see the mastery
of the British replaced by the mastery
of the Hindus

GANDHI
(patiently not yet
believing it cant
be settled)
Muslim and Hindu are the right and
left eye of India No one will be
slave no one master

Jinnah sneers at the idea though he cools a little

JINNAH
The world is not made of Mahatma

and Patel)

majority on two different sides of

JINNAH

Let us worry about Pakistan -- you
worry about India
Gandhi is staring at Jinnah trying to fathom the source
his anger and fear He turns to see that Mountbatten
been standing in the open door to the conference room
torn as Gandhi by the conflict feeling it best
in formal discussion
MOUNTBATTEN
Gentlemen perhaps we should
recommence
Gandhi nods and reluctantly the adversaries move back
the conference room Gandhi is last through the door
pauses by Mountbatten a little sigh -- How difficult
difficult -- then he puts a friendly hand on
shoulder and the two of them enter together

GANDHIS ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

Kallenbach shoos a chicken from the back seat of the
and dusts off the seat He steps back out

Gandhi is approaching with Nehru and Azad Pyarelal
close behind We have seen Azad and Pyarelal come out
porch behind Nehru As Gandhi near the car a Hindu
with a black flag calls to him

HINDU YOUTH
Bapu -- please Dont do it

They are all awed timid even in his actual presence
the mood of their gathering has changed altogether
looks at the youth and the line of others

GANDHI

(impatiently)
What do you want me not to do Not
to meet with Mr Jinnah

(Fiercely)
I am a Muslim

(He stares at them

then relents)
And a Hindu and a Christian and a
Jew -- and so are all of you When
you wave those flags and shout you
send fear into the hearts of your
brothers

He sweeps them sternly with his eyes all his fatigue

GANDHI
This is not the India I want Stop
it For Gods sake stop it

And he lowers his head and moves on to the car where
Kallenbach holds the door for him Nehru Azad and

following
Another angle As they get into the car we see the car
sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths In
back seat we see two men one of whom is Prakash (The
man at Gandhis assassination)
JINNAHS DRAWING ROOM - INTERIOR - NIGHT
Jinnah is on the small balcony of this elaborate room
looking down in a slightly supercilious manner As
is impeccably dressed
JINNAH

Now please if youve finished your

prayers could we begin with business
He has been looking at Gandhi who sits on the floor of
large room some distance from him just lifting his
from prayers
Nehru Patel and Azad are on the same side of the room
Gandhi They rise from prayer as Jinnah comes down the
to them Gandhi hesitates then begins

GANDHI

My dear Jinnah you and I are brothers

born of the same Mother India If

you have fears I want to put them

to rest

(Jinnah listens
impatiently
great not
a

satisfied

surprise

Nehru

has

skeptically Gandhi
just glances in
Nehrus direction)

I am asking Panditji to stand down

I want you to be the first Prime

Minister of India
(Jinnah raises an
eyebrow of interest)
-- to name your entire cabinet

to

make the head of every government

department a Muslim

And Jinnah has drawn himself up His vanity is too

to be touched by that prospect He measures Gandhi for

moment to see that he is sincere and when he is

with that he turns slowly to Nehru Patel and Azad

Nehru glances at Patel They have all been taken by

by the offer -- and do not feel what Gandhi feels

looks hesitantly at Gandhi

NEHRU
Bapu for me and the rest
(his hand gestures to
Patel and Azad)

if that is what you want we will

accept it But out there
(he indicates the
streets)

already there is rioting because
Hindus fear you are going to give

too much away

PATEL

If you did this no one could control

it No one

It bears the stamp of undeniable truth Gandhis eyes

with the despair of a man whose last hope

crumbled around him

whose faith

Jinnah smiles cynically he spreads his hands See

Silence The little flagpole is empty the rope
flapping loosely down the pole

Gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow

spinning The

of the spinning wheel Inside we can just see Mirabehn
spinning too But apart from that he is alone the

ashram seems deserted We hear the sound of a bell on
the goats fairly distant

THE PATH TO THE ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

Featuring Kallenbach He is taking the goat and

near the path of the ashram He stills the bell with
hand As he ties it the camera angle widens and we see
Margaret Bourke-White sitting on the grass watching

Kallenbach and looking off toward Gandhis bungalow

KALLENBACH

BOURKE-WHITE
I came all this way because I believed
the picture of Independence Day was
of him here alone

Kallenbach stands and looks across at her judging
appealing to her humanity
KALLENBACH
It is violence and the fear of
violence that have made today what
it is Give him the dignity of his
grief
Bourke-White grabs a clump of grass twists it free
sighs She tosses the grass vaguely at the goat
BOURKE-WHITE
And while were sitting here feeding
goats what will happen to all the
Muslims in India and the Hindus in
Pakistan
Kallenbach stops staring absently at the ground ahead
KALLENBACH
Gandhi will pray for them

with swords and clubs leap into battle

NEHRUS OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY

Chaos It and the adjoining office have been made into
something like operations rooms Military and civilian

move back and forth Telephones at work everywhere A
map on the wall is constantly having data changed by
receiving messages there

Nehru is glancing at a telex message he turns and
back to the military aide whos given it to him

NEHRU
(fast curt)
No There just are not that many
troops

MILITARY AIDE
Whats he to do

NEHRU
What he can

He turns Patel has a message he was going to present

to
him He hesitates grins dismally and crumples the
message --
No use Nehru sags He looks at Patel with haggard
eyes
NEHRU
He was right Its insane -- anything
would have been better
PATEL
Have you found him
Nehru nods solemnly
NEHRU
Hes in Noakhali
Patel reacts to that -- surprise apprehension
NEHRU
Hes tramping from village to village --
no police no troops -- trying to
quell the madness single-handedly
(He sighs half in
admiration half in
hopeless exasperation
at the old mans
audacity)
Maulana has gone to bring him back
Patel nods grimly -- the noisy chaos of the room
Someone
shouts at Nehru Prime Minister

What you have done in Noakhali is a
miracle Bapu a miracle but millions
are on the move -- millions There
is no way to stop it and no one
can count the dead

The camera angle has changed We are in

NEHRUS PRIVATE CHAMBERS - INTERIOR - NIGHT

Patel and Azad are there and Pyarelal of course and
them now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan the
time we have seen him among Gandhis intimate group

NEHRU
In Calcutta its like civil war The
Muslims rose and there was a
bloodbath and now the Hindus are
taking revenge -- and if we cant
stop it therell be no hope for the
Hindus left in Pakistan

PATEL
an eye for an eye making the whole
world blind

It is an empty and despairing echo of Gandhis words

AZAD
Arent there any troops to spare

NEHRU
(tense fragile)
Nothing -- nothing The divisions in

Bombay and Delhi can hardly keep the
peace now And each fresh bit of
news creates another wave of mad

He has turned and seen Gandhi standing slowly It has
stopped him

Calcutta

CALCUTTA - EXTERIOR - NIGHT
We are high There are fires the sounds of spasmodic

of looting screams the roar of police vehicles and
occasional sirens The camera zooms in on a poor

artisan dwellings in narrow streets Outside one of the
is a car an army jeep policemen a few soldiers and a
of people It seems a little island of calm in a sea of
chaos

There is a sudden commotion just below them and angry
Death to Muslims Death to Muslims
Gandhi peers down
His point of view A surging gang of youths many
torches and far outnumbering the little group of
soldiers are shouting up at the roof We see three or
black flags and stains of blood on many of them A few

knives still wet with blood

A YOUTH
There he is

A feral roar goes up at the sight of Gandhi but he

unmoving

HINDU YOUTH LEADER
(his voice emotional
tearful)
Why are you staying at the home of a
Muslim Theyre murderers They killed

GANDHI
(to the youth)
Go -- do as your mother and father
would wish you to do
It is ambiguous open-ended meaning anything your
and father would wish you to do Tears flush from the
eyes and he stares at Gandhi with a kind of hopeless
and rage But the impact is on the youth alone around
the others begin to take up the chant Death to

Death to Muslims

Gandhi turns from the street He looks at the police
commissioner -- at his fatigue his concern his

respect Gandhi musters a weary smile

GANDHI
I have lived a lifetime If I had
shunned death -- or feared it -- I

would not be here Nor would you be
concerned for me
(He lets it sink in
then he takes the
commissioners arm
and moves back toward
the center of the
roof)
Leave me -- and take your men
(An understanding
touch of the arm)
You have more important things to
worry about

The commissioner looks at him uncertain not knowing

HOSPITAL - INTERIOR - DAY

An old inadequate hospital -- dark cavernous Margaret
White is moving among the densely packed litter of
women She is positioning herself to photograph Gandhi
is speaking to a woman who cradles a small baby The
behind him are even more packed The few doctors and
hardly have room to move

Featuring Gandhi Azad and Mirabehn are behind him as

moves on and behind them like a giant guardian Abdul
Ghaffar Khan We hear Bapu Bapu muttered quietly

there Gandhi bends to a woman whose face is bandaged
cruel wound is half-exposed between her mouth and eye

WOMAN
Bapu Allah be with you

There are tears in Gandhis eyes now

GANDHI
And with you
(He touches her
wrinkled hand)
Pray I cannot help you -- pray

And the weight of his helplessness hangs on him

to his aide

NEHRU
Why must I read news like this in

AN OUTSIDE STAIRCASE - TAHIBS HOUSE

It runs up the side of the building and is lined with
people Nehru and Patel are climbing the stairs moving
them almost irritably as they mutter Nehru Nehru
and make the pranam to the eminent men

In the heat of the city Tahibs rooftop is still

home and has become a center of activity Azad clears
someone aside and ushers Nehru and Patel under the

awning

Nehru pauses as he lowers his head

His point of view Gandhi lies curled awkwardly on his
of the cot He is writing Pyarelal taking the pages as
finishes both ignoring all the people the sounds of
and distant shouting but he looks tired and tightens
jaw occasionally in pain The camera pans A doctor
near the foot of the cot Abdul Ghaffar Khan beyond
Near the other edge of the canopied area Mirabehn sits
Bourke-White They are whispering quietly but Mirabehn
stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved

She knows Gandhis feeling for him Bourke-White stares
him and Patel for a second and then her hand goes
almost reflexively for her camera

CLOSER ON GANDHI
Nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at

Gandhis

eyeline Gandhi must take his eyes from his writing to
look

and he is almost moved to tears at the sight of Nehru
His

hand shakes a little as he holds it out to him

NEHRU
Bapu

Gandhi turns to pat their joined hands with his other

hand

He does so with effort and at last he sees Patel

GANDHI
Sardar
(He looks him over)
You have gained weight You must
join me in the fast

Patel sits near the head of the cot so the three of
them are

on a level Outside the canopied area Bourke-White is

crouched her camera framing the three of them

PATEL
(wittily warmly)
If I fast I die If you fast people
go to all sorts of trouble to keep
you alive

Gandhi smiles and reaches to touch hands with him

NEHRU
Bapu forgive me -- Ive cheated I
could have come earlier But your
fast has helped These last days
peoples minds have begun to turn to
this bed -- and away from last nights
atrocity But now it is enough

Gandhi shakes his head

GANDHI
All that has happened is that Ive
grown a little thinner

It is despairingly sincere But Nehru feels he has an
antidote
for that despair The distant sound of an explosion
NEHRU

Tomorrow five thousand Muslim students
of all ages are marching here in
Calcutta -- for peace

(The real point)
And five thousand Hindu students are
marching with them It is all
organized

Bourke-White captures the sense of elation in his face

From

her discreet distance she lowers the camera holding
it

against her mouth waiting for Gandhis response

Gandhi nods to Nehru accepting the news with a sad

wistfulness

GANDHI
Im glad -- but it will not be enough

Nehru isnt prepared for this resistance He glances at
Patel

and we see that they recognize that their bland
conviction

that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply
misplaced

Nehru turns back -- this time no confidence only
concern A
forced smile

NEHRU
Bapu you are not so young anymore

Gandhi smiles pain etched in his eyes He touches
Nehrus
hand

GANDHI

Dont worry for me -- death will be
a deliverance

(There is water in

his eyes but his

words have the weight

of a man truly

determined to die)
I cannot watch the destruction of
all I have lived for

Nehru stares at him feeling the sudden fear that
Gandhi
gripped by

crowd

sounds

lying on

speaks

Gandhi but
in

the

means it Patel Mirabehn Azad Bourke-White are

the same realization

TAHIBS HOUSE - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

An outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual
grown even larger now and more women among them The
of distant fighting

TAHIBS ROOF - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

The senior technician in earphones signals across to
Mirabehn She holds a microphone by Gandhi who is

his side He seems almost out of touch

MIRABEHN
Bapu

Gandhi looks at her and then the microphone When he
into the microphone his voice is very weak

GANDHI

Each night before I sleep I read a
few words from the Gita and the Koran
and the Bible

(we intercut with

Bourke-White and

those on the roof

watching)
tonight I ask you to share these
thoughts of God with me

And now we go into the streets intercutting with
seeing Hindus listening around loudspeakers on corners
little eating houses Muslim shops where people live in
back and neighbors gathering defensively in groups

GANDHI
(the books are there
but he does it from
memory of course)
I will begin with the Bible where
the words of the Lord are Love thy
neighbor as thyself and then our

He leans back exhausted Mirabehn is looking at him
starts to sing softly

MIRABEHN

Lead Kindly Light amidst the

circling gloom
Gandhi his eyes closed takes it up in his weak
voice

GANDHI MIRABEHN

The night is dark and I am far

from home Lead thou me on
TAHIBS HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY
Two police motorcycles lead a black limousine to a stop
Tahibs house The crowd now gathered is very large
mixed than before but still predominantly of youths
still with black flags
Nehru gets out of the limousine with a Muslim leader a
looking man who carries himself with the authority and
of a mobster (Suhrawardy) And they start to go up the
stairs
Suddenly we hear the shout Death to Gandhi Death

Gandhi And Nehru turns pushing past Suhrawardy

and going back onto the street He runs at the crowd

the shout comes once more from the back His face is

with anger and shock
NEHRU

(hysterically)
Who dares say such things Who

(And he is running at

them and they spread

in fear)
Come Kill me first Come Where are
you Kill me first

The crowd has spread from him all along the street

they

stand against the walls of the houses staring at him

terrified to move We see just in passing the
frightened

apprehensive faces of Godse and near him Apte and
Karkare

Nehru stands staring at them all his face seething
with

anger

TAHIBS ROOF - EXTERIOR - DAY

We are featuring a copy of Life Magazine On the cover
isa

picture of rioting men fighting and diagonally a cut-
out of

Gandhi lying on his cot The caption reads An Old
Mans

Battle As the magazine starts to be opened it is
suddenly

put to one side

Another angle Mirabehn is rising leaving the magazine
at

her feet She moves to Nehru and Suhrawardy as Azad
ushers

them into the canopied area Abdul Ghaffar Khan sits
quietly

in the background Mirabehn speaks softly

MIRABEHN
His pulse is very irregular -- the
kidneys arent functioning

Nehru looks across at Gandhi The doctor who is
testing

Gandhis pulse yet again glances at him -- no
encouragement --

and moves away Nehru moves to the side of the cot and
Gandhi

smiles weakly and holds out a hand but he is in pain
NEHRU
Bapu I have brought Mr Suhrawardy
It was he who called on the Muslims
to rise he is telling them now to
go back to their homes to lay down

their arms
Gandhi looks up at Suhrawardy who nods Gandhi looks
back
at Nehru There is no hint of him changing his mind
NEHRU
(personally)
Think what you can do by living --
that you cannot do by dying
Gandhi smiles whimsically he touches him again but
there is
no change in his attitude
NEHRU
(pleadingly)
What do you want
GANDHI
(a moment)
That the fighting will stop -- that
you make me believe it will never
start again
Nehru looks at him hopelessly
SQUARE IN CALCUTTA - EXTERIOR - DAY
A huge crowd some smoke in distant buildings some
damage
near to help us know this is still Calcutta and all is
not
yet at peace The camera sweeps over the crowd past
the
loudspeakers on their poles We see surly knots of
belligerent
rowdies mostly young but not all hanging on the
fringes
as we move over the heads of the mass of listening
people to
a platform where Nehru speaks Azad Suhrawardy and
others
sit on the floor behind him We have heard his voice
over

all this

Sometimes it is when you are quite

away your revenge What will be

gained by more killing Have the

courage to do what you know is right

For Gods sake let us embrace like

brothers
TAHIBS ROOF - EXTERIOR - NIGHT
Featuring the Muslim leader Suhrawardy leaning against
wall watching an action out of shot with evident
We hear a little clank of metal
Another angle There are five men facing Gandhi They
black trousers and black knit vests There are thongs
their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even
powerful They are Hindu thugs (Goondas) Their clothes
dirty -- and they are too -- but they are laying knives
guns at Gandhis feet
Mirabehn Azad Pyarelal the doctor and others on the
watch fascinated a little frightened

GOONDA LEADER

It is our promise We stop It isa

promise
Gandhi is looking at him testing not giving or

anything that is mere gesture

GANDHI
Go -- try -- God by with you

The Goondas stand They glance at Suhrawardy he smiles

and they start to leave but one (Nahari) lingers
he moves violently toward Gandhi taking a flat piece

of
Indian bread (chapati) from his trousers and tossing it
forcefully on Gandhi
NAHARTI
Eat
Mirabehn and Azad start to move toward him -- the man
looks
immensely strong and immensely unstable But Gandhi
holds up
a shaking hand stopping them Naharis face is knotted
in
emotion half anger half almost a childs fear -- but
there
is a wild menace in that instability
NAHARTI
Eat I am going to hell -- but not
with your death on my soul
GANDHI
Only God decides who goes to hell
NAHARTI
(stiffening aggressive)
I -- I killed a child
(Then an anguished
defiance)
I smashed his head against a wall
Gandhi stares at him breathless
GANDHI
(in a fearful whisper)
Why Why
It is as though the man has told him of some terrible
self-
inflicted wound
NAHARTI
(tears now -- and
wrath)
They killed my son -- my boy
Almost reflexively he holds his hand out to indicate
the
height of his son He glares at Suhrawardy and then
back at

Gandhi
NAHARTI
The Muslims killed my son they
killed him

He is sobbing but in his anger it seems almost as

though he
means to kill Gandhi in retaliation A long moment as
Gandhi
meets his pain and wrath Then
GANDHI
I know a way out of hell
Nahari sneers but there is just a flicker of desperate
curiosity
GANDHI
Find a child -- a child whose mother
and father have been killed A little
boy -- about this high
He raises his hand to the height Nahari has indicated
as his
sons
GANDHI
and raise him -- as your own
Nahari has listened His face almost cracks -- it is a
chink
of light but it does not illumine his darkness
GANDHI
Only be sure that he is a Muslim
And that you raise him as one
And now the light falls on Nahari His face stiffens
he
swallows fighting any show of emotion then he turns
to go
But he takes only a step and he turns back going to
his
knees the sobs breaking again and again from his
heaving
body as he holds his head to Gandhis feet in the
traditional
greeting of Hindu son to Hindu father A second and

The sergeant sighs and moves to the outside door We

him bellow Stand down The constable hangs up and
sighs
heavily The senior riot squad officer shakes his head
and
turns and walks slowly to the door

HIGH SHOT - CALCUTTA - EXTERIOR - NIGHT
It lies in silence
TAHIBS ROOF - EXTERIOR - DAY
Mirabehn is bent over Gandhi He is curled almost in
the

fetal position his face looking wan and sunken For
the
first time there is silence no explosions no distant

shouts
no gunfire
MIRABEHN
Bapu theres been no fighting --
anywhere It has stopped -- the
madness has stopped
We see the police commissioner Suhrawardy two
doctors
Abdul Ghaffar Khan and some others Nearer Gandhi
behind
Mirabehn are Nehru Patel Azad and Pyarelal
Gandhi turns to Mirabehn his face shaking peering
into her
eyes
GANDHI
It is foolish if it is just to save
the life of an old man
MIRABEHN
No no In every temple and mosque
they have pledged to die before they
lift a hand against each other
His weary eyes look at her he looks up slowly to Azad
Azad
nods Its true Then Patel
PATEL
Everywhere
Gandhi looks at Nehru Nehru just nods tautly Gandhi
looks
down then lifts his head to Azad
GANDHI
Maulana my friend could I have
some orange juice Then you and I
will take a piece of bread together
The relief brings water to their eyes and grins to
their
faces Nehru bends to Gandhi Gandhi holds his hand out
to

him and Nehru clutches it Then

I have fasted only a few hours and I

It is a joke in their way with each other and Gandhis

hand over Nehrus and Nehru lowers his head to it
silently
BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY
As in the opening sequence -- but a few minutes
crowd is beginning to gather for the evening prayers

a tonga or two a gardener opening the gate to the

three policemen standing talking idly among

BIRLA HOUSE - INTERIOR - DAY
Laughter Gandhi is eating muli he holds his head back
capture the lemon juice We hear the click of a camera

GANDHI
That is how you eat muli

Manu hands him a cloth and he wipes his hands Another
of a camera He is not fully recovered but well on the
GANDHI
(to the photographer)

Im not sure I want to be remembered

that way
It is all light and for fun We get a wide-angle shot
and see that Bourke-White is shooting one of her
subjects again She is enjoying the banter as is

who is spinning quietly to one side of the room and

who sits cross-legged like Gandhi on the floor
working on papers with him but grins at this

BOURKE-WHITE
Dont worry with luck you may not
be

And she shoots him again as he hands the cloth back to
Manu

Abha is sitting next to Manu looking at a collection
of

pictures of Gandhi obviously Bourke-Whites

PATEL
No hell be remembered for tempting
fate

It is wry but waspishly chiding Abha suddenly holds a

picture up for Gandhi to see Its one of him ears
wide

eyes round

ABHA
Mickey Mouse

Gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she
smiles

But Bourke-White has looked from Patel to Gandhi
clearly

shaken by the implication in Patels words

BOURKE-WHITE
You really are going to Pakistan
then
(Gandhi shrugs and
she chides too)
You are a stubborn man

GANDHI

(a grin in the mood

of their flirtation)
Im simply going to prove to Muslims
there and Hindus here that the
only devils in the world are those
running around in our own hearts --
and thats where all our battles
ought to be fought

Abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his
dhoti

He glances at it and holds his arms out The two girls
help

him
BOURKE-WHITE
And what kind of a warrior have you
been in that warfare

She is photographing his getting-up and leaning on the
two
girls

GANDHI
Not a very good one Thats why I
have so much tolerance for the other
scoundrels of the world

He moves off but has a sudden thought and turns to
Patel

GANDHI
Ask Panditji to -- to consider what
weve discussed

Patel nods soberly and Gandhi starts for the door
Bourke-
White moving with him

GANDHI
(of the photographs)
Enough

BOURKE-WHITE
(a plea)
One more

He has passed her hes in the doorway We see the
crowd at

the end of the garden where the light of the day is
beginning

to soften He turns teasing in his slightly
flirtatious way

with women

GANDHI
Youre a temptress

She shoots him against the door -- the crowd milling
distantly waiting -- then she lowers her camera

BOURKE-WHITE
Just an admirer

GANDHI

for an old man
He turns the last words have betrayed the smile on his
they have a painful sense of truth about them Bourke-
watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in
distance
She turns to Mirabehn

BOURKE-WHITE
Theres a sadness in him

Its an observation -- and a question Mirabehn accedes
gravely

MIRABEHN
He thinks hes failed

Bourke-White stares at her then turns to look out at
BOURKE-WHITE
Why My God if anythings proved
him right its whats happened these
last months
Mirabehn nods but she keeps on spinning and tries to
cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps
through in her voice and on her face
MIRABEHN
I am blinded by my love of him but
I think when we most needed it he
offered the world a way out of
madness But he doesnt see it
and neither does the world
It is laced with pain Bourke-White turns and looks out
Gandhi -- so tiny so weak as he walks between his
He has now reached the end of the garden and is moving

the crowd assembled there

Gandhi is moving forward in the crowd one hand resting

crowd from his point of view -- Bapu God bless
Thank you -- thank you He turns to a very old woman
makes a salaam to him Gandhi touches her head

GANDHI
Allah be with you

Smiling he turns back A jostling the sound of beads
falling

MANU
(to someone)
Brother Bapu is already late for
prayers
Gandhi turns to the person he makes the pranam
Full shot Godse is making the pranam to him and he
wildly draws his gun and fires The camera closes on
as he staggers and falls the red stain of blood

through his white shawl

GANDHI
Oh God oh God

Manu and Abha bend over him silent in their first
The sound of panic and alarm begins to grow around
they suddenly scream and begin to cry

emotion

the

timeless

The camera is pulling back very slowly and we can tell

blackness is smoke rising from a fire

And now we see that it is a funeral pyre And all

that pyre a mass of silent humanity Through the smoke
sitting cross-legged near the rim of the flames we see

Nehru and Azad and Patel Mirabehn and Kallenbach

drawn faces of Lord and Lady Mountbatten Manu and

THE RIVER - EXTERIOR - DAY

A helicopter shot coming slowly up the wide river low
a barge and a mass of people in the distance

And now we are over the barge and it is covered with

Flowers flow downstream around it An urn sits on it --
containing Gandhis ashes -- and Nehru stands near it

and Patel a little behind him And as the barge floats
the river Nehru bends and lifts the urn
Featuring Nehru He swallows restraining his own
and slowly ritualistically sprinkles the ashes over
water
And as they spread we hold on that stretch of the
the flowers swirling languidly around it as the dark
current moves them toward the sea
GANDHIS VOICE
(weak struggling as
he spoke the words

to Mirabehn)
There have been tyrants and

murderers -- and for a time they can
seem invincible But in the end they
always fall Think of it -- always

When you are in doubt that that is
Gods way the way the world is meant
to be think of that

And slowly the camera begins pulling back
flowers the brown

leaving the
rolling current as though leaving

story of Gandhi going far out away from the great

reaching higher and higher through streaks of clouds

titles begin

And through them once more we hear dimly

through the rushing wind

At home children are writing essays about him

croaky voice singing God save our gracious King

Sergeant Major -- the Sergeant Major Take aim

Fire the sound of massed rifle fire screams

my best friend my highest guru and my sovereign

Who the hell is he
Gandhi

I dont know sir My name is
Mohandas K Gandhi the sound of rioting

screams terror Find a child -- a child whose

father have been killed A little boy about this
He thinks hes failed Long live Mahatma
Long live Mahatma Gandhi
