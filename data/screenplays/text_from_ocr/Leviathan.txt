LEVIATHAN

Screenplay by

David Webb Peoples
and

Jeb Stuart

Revised Draft

September 8 1987

FACE IN ON
THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER

Moving down from the bright surface waters through layers
of fish and marine life

A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current
their numbers are enormous their movements in unison
Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the
school taking out four or five before disappearing into the
shadows The school moves on as if nothing happened
quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only
seconds before
WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER

Fish disappear darkness envelopes us Cold and lifeless
where light has never penetratedFive thousand feet ten
thousand Deeper where only strange self-illuminating
echoniderms move eerily through the currents Then suddenly
WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION THEN VOICES

JONES
BurritosEnchiladas

DEJESUS

(hispanic voice)
Oh gag man how can you eat that
stuff

BOWMAN
(female)
I cant wait for fresh vegetables

Several voices suddenly break into argumentvegetables
shit burgersSuddenly another voice rises above the
others

BECKS VOICE RADIO
Okay cut the chatter Youre
not out of here yet Whos the
hook SevenYou got a hook on
container 22

A pause then more voices

SIXPACKS VOICE RADIO
(redneck drawl)
The mans asking if youre hooked
on 22 you dumb shit

JONES VOICE RADIO
Watch your mouth Sixpack Hello
Shack Seven here I aint the hook
over

A light flares out of the darkness suddenly illuminating an
IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal
nearly seven feet tall It is a motorized diving suit and
we see the stenciled name WILLIE across the front
breastplate As it pivots we see the stationary worklights
around the base of a large underwater mining operation THE
SHACK Then a womans voice

WILLIES VOICE
(womans voice)
Six to Shack Im the hook
INSIDE THE SHACK CONTROL ROOM

littered with papers half-full coffee cups and a confusion
of wires and very low-tech high-tech equipment BECK sits at
the monitor controls He is younger than we expected
twenties clean cut good looks Hell be a hell of a good-
looking man at thirty-five he just needs to be hardened
From the looks of the coffee cups around him hes on his
way

BECKS VOICE RADIO
Okay Six lets wrap this container
and call it a day

Above him a bank of monitor screens Each one labeled with
a crew members name and providing a video picture from a
camera mounted on their helmet Beck reaches above him and
throws a console switch which activates another monitor
labeled ROV With a joystick he manipulates an outside
camera(the ROV) its picture we see on the monitor It is
moving

UNDERWATER

WILLIES POV The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED
gauges monitoring air reserve body temperature
atmospheres heart rate blood pressure

She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes
the tool attached to the end of her arm The move is
practiced and professional like a cook changing the tool on
a set of egg beaters First she inserts the existing tool
into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she
disengages the tool Next she selects the next tool from
the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into
position Sixpacks voice comes over the radio

SIXPACKS VOICE
Hey Willie you trip ona
tit or something Were all
waiting on you honey

WILLIE

(under control)
Keep your pants on Sixpack
I promise youll be inside before
Mr Rogers Neighborhood comes on

OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other mens voices laughing They
like Willie and cheer her on Tell him Willie Atta
girl etc

Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns Expertly she
hooks a large dumpster-like container the container to what
looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER
TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the
massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in
by a winch

WILLIES VOICE
Six to ShackHooks on Ready
to winch

UNDERWATER MACHINERY

Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and
dumpsters squatting in the gloom A winch begins grinding
and the big newly hooked container lurches down the tracks
It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with
several others to complete a set We hear BECKS VOICE

BECK RADIO
Ok thats it Come on in

More motor suited DIVERS appear their helmet lights
glaring Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights
COBS BOWMAN WILLIE

As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK where an elevator will
transport them up into the Shack we see signs of human

life a basketball goal attached to the side of the

building stickers and signs No Bozos etc A formal sign
towers over the entrance It says TRANSOCEAN CORP SHACK 6

ON ONE OF THE CREW

He moves behind the others Suddenly he freezes in his
tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the
glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA
SPIDER Its thick legs moving eerily down his arm

Carefully so as not to disturb the creature a mechanical
motor hand moves into position below it and in one quick
movement snares it

CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET The latch opens and the
writhing sea spider is shoved inside From the pocket WE
MOVE UP the divers suit until we see the name SIXPACK on
the breastplate He looks around to see if anyone has
noticed then continues on toward the shack

ON TWO DIVERS (JONES AND DEJESUS)
They walk together to the Shack A Latino VOICE DEJESUS
comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an
exaggerated accent

DEJESUS
When its time to relax
One thing stands clear

INSIDE ON BECK

As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker we see
he aches to be a part of their comaraderie but is alienated
by age and rank He is the shack boss management He
listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key

JONES VOICE(OC)
Mil-lers tastes too good to
hurry through

As the singing continues Beck looks over at an empty chair
in front of a bank of equipment monitors The vital signs
of each miner and his equipment are registered on this
console The chair in front of them sits conspicuously
empty This doesnt please Beck neither does a hand
written sign under the console which states THE DOCTOR IS
OUT

DEJESUS POV

Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring
vital signs

DEJESUS
beer after beer

Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom
corner inside DeJesus helmet The words to the song freeze
in his mouth His voice becomes edged with panic

DEJESUS (contd)
Oh shit

JONES RADIO
(to DeJesus)
Hey Hazy Im not that bad man

DEJESUS

(rising terror)
Jonesy Im losing compression
Im going to blow my suit man
Beck Doc Help me
INSIDE

Beck grabs his microphone He tries to remain calm but
there is a definite tremble in his voice

BECK
Give me a readout DeJesus

DEJESUS (ON RADIO)
(gripped with panic)
Ahhhh

OUTSIDE
The other divers move quickly to DeJesus

BECK (ON RADIO)
DeJesus A readout

JONES
He dont need a readout
man he needs help

BECK (RADIO)
(anything but calm)
Stay calm

BOWMAN
Calm Wheres Doc

INSIDE
Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors lost

BECK

(trying to

keep control)
The internal monitors read
normal

ON THE MINERS PANICKED

COBB
Wheres Doc

BECK (RADIO)
Hes not at his station

DEJESUS
(panicked)
Oh mother of Jesus forgive

BECKS VOICE
(making a decision)
Get him into the Shack

DeJesus gauges begins a countdown to implosion 15 14
13 DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the
last few yards to the SHACK

INSIDESHACK - SAME

ON BECK sweating bullets turns a dial on the instruments
and suddenly DeJesus gauges jump to life We see the same
countdown in progress on the Shacks gauges10 9 8

OUTSIDE

ON DEJESUS He is forced into the LOCK the underwater
elevator room is eerily lit His readout continues inside
his helmet5 4 3DeJesus screams

ON BECK

DeJesus scream comes over his radio in the control room
Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens He hits it
again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by
the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator Its moving
Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock

INSIDELIFT LOCK

WE SEE DeJESUSS SUIT dripping wet It stands inside the
Lift Lock ankle deep in greasy bilge water

CLOSE ON HIS EYES for a moment they remain closed then
suddenly they flutter Hes alive

THE MESS - LATER

The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess
features neatly stenciled letters that say DAYS TILL
PICKUP The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board
obviously changes daily Right now its a 3

A CLUNK CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE
MACHINE A big sandy-haired man SIXPACK takes the soft
drink pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he
looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners JONES
Black athletic 30s COBB 50s a career miner with a
mouthful of gum BOWMAN 35 attractive hardened woman she
has seen more of the world than any of them WILLIE
twenties fresh good looks master electrician optimist
DEJESUS Latino wiry muscles he keeps his head down still
shaken from his experience

The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the
oceans surface has drawn nerves tight

BOWMAN
Im telling you its the suits

JONES
Fuck the suits its the people
monitoring them It Doc had been
there like hes supposed to it never
wouldve happened

SIXPACK
And just what the fuck would he
have done to stop it huh

Sixpack looks over the group then suddenly crushes the
empty Coke can in his hand punctuating the action with a
huge belch

SIXPACK (contd)
That would have been you DeJesus

DeJesus keeps his head down

SIXPACK (contd)
YeahI was standing next to a guy
who blew a suit once in the
Indian Oceanlittle tiny hole
in the fucking toe of his suit
»ocean came in and the
pressure crammed his whole
fucking body up into his helmet
They just buried his helmet

DEJESUS
(coldly)
I know all about implosion man

SIXPACK
Yeah I bet you do
(laughs)
I bet you were imploding in
your pants
(laughs then imitates
a hysterical DeJesus)
Jonesy DocHelp me Help me
DeJesus springs for Sixpacks throat AS WE CUT TO
BECK - SAME
Becks eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks

BECK
Knock it off Sixpack I know
its been a long month for every-
one but we cant let something
like this tear us apart

Beck glares ready for an argument but as WE PULL BACK we
see hes talking to the mirror in his tiny quarters

Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard
look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away

BECK
Shit

He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at
college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking
father Leadership how-to books like The One Minute
Manager etc line his bookshelf with technical manuals on
underwater mining

He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC
GROANING NOISE stops him cold The entire Shack seems
shifting like a giant waking from a nap

MESS

The NOISE stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold
All eyes go to the ceiling and walls

JONES
Fuck the suits manthis
place is going to kill us first

Just as suddenly as it began the GROANING NOISE STOPS and in
its place WE HEAR an intermittent RATTLE in the air system
Only Cobb seems undisturbed by this sound

DEJESUS

(listening)
There it is again

(sitting down again)
Two more days I tell myself
you can make it two more days--

BOWMAN
Whats the weather like up top

WILLIE
Clear for pickup

JONES
Lets hope it holds

Cobb looks up disgustingly

COBB
Then what Huh
(to everyone)
Then what You folks think
going up tops the answer to
all your problems Well it aint

BOWMAN
Give us a break Cobb

COBB
A break You folks dont need a break
you need psychiatrists Know what

youd be doing if you were up there
right now

SIXPACK
(a boorish leer)
Eating pussy and drinking brew

COBB
Eating pussy my ass What about
lines at the bank What about
getting stuck in traffic

SIXPACK
(grinning)
Wherever I can find it

Everyone laughs but Cobb WE SEE hes serious

COBB
Bullshit Ill tell you
what youd be doing Youd
be watching news on TV
thats so fucking bad it
makes you nauseous So you
go out and get in your car
to get some fresh air and
after youve been driving for
five minutes you realize the
airs so damn dirty you dont dare
breath it Thats what youve
got to look forward to

LOWER RING CORRIDOR

Beck approaches the Mess and as he nears it we hear Cobb
ranting inside

COBBS VOICE(OS)
And if youre lucky
enough to make it back home
to your house that looks the
fucking same as everyone elses
youll find your wifes just as
fat as she was when you left and
the only reason your kids aint
strung out on the drugs they were
using when you left is that
theyve found some new drugs
which fuck em up even more
You people just dont appreciate
how good youve got down here

BECK hesitates at the door to the Mess as though screwing
up his courage then takes a deep breath and enters as we

CUT TO
INSIDE THE MESS

Everyone looks up as Beck enters and the room goes quiet
Beck notices Docs empty chair

BECK
Doc eat already

JONES
The good doctor hasnt showed yet

Looks are exchanged Sixpack smirks knowingly

BECK
(to DeJesus)
How do you feel DeJesus

DEJESUS

(obviously embarrassed

to be singled out)
Okay

BECK
Better let the Doc take a
look at you after dinner

SIXPACK
Yeah since he was busy earlier
when you needed him

He cracks up and Beck turns on him

BECK
Cut it Sixpack

Sixpack shuts up but Beck notices the others feel the
seriousness of Docs absence during the emergency

BECK (contd)
Leave the Doc to me Im
going to talk to him

SIXPACK
(sarcastically under his
breath to Bowman)

Makes me feel better already

Beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about
something else He clears his throat

BECK
Ive been looking at the duty
rosterat the shack hours

outstanding

JONES
Uh ohI see where this
is going

BECK

(ignoring Jones)
all of you owe time and I
thought tonight would be a good
time to---

COBB
(erupting)
No way Mister Beck No
fucking way We just did a
full shift you cant call
Shack duty on top of a full
shift Its a contract violation

JONES
Whooo Right on Cobb Lets
hear it for our shop Steward
SIXPACK
Hear that Becky er Mr Beck
Company got to abide by the rules

FIVE FACES STARE AT BECK THEYRE LOOKING FOR WEAKNESS
THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY

BECK
I know all about the contract
The point is you can follow the
goddamn contract to the letter and pull
your shack duty tomorrowor you
can get it done tonight and call
tomorrow a down day Its up to you

This leaves the group momentarily speechless Even DeJesus
comes out of his stupor

DEJESUS
You giving us a day off

Beck nods Cobb eyes him suspiciously

COBB
What about our quota

BECK
Youre only twenty-five
tons off quota Barring an
unforeseen problem you should
reach it easily on the last day

(he looks at the group)
Its just a day off You dont
have to take it I just thought it
might help

The others look around for agreement but Jones doesnt need
anyone elses approval hes already made up his mind

JONES
Count me in

Bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree
Buoyed Beck moves ahead businesslike

BECK
Cobb Jones I want you to do
something about that damn rattle
in the air system
(to Bowman and Sixpack)
Bowman and Sixpackliving quarters
SIXPACK

(disgustedly)

Shit
BECK

Williamsget DeJesus suit on

(to group)

Any other suit problems she should

Sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses

SIXPACK

(to Willie)
My pocket Check my pocket

WILLIE
(annoyed)
Your pocket
SIXPACK
The latch is screwed up Or
the hinge
WILLIE
(disgusted)
Right

LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

ON BECK He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds
himself walking with Willie Beck is obviously
uncomfortable with the crew even after 28 days together
She smiles friendly at ease

WILLIE
You did good

BECK
(a little surprised)
What

WILLIE
Todaywith DeJesus That
was smart thinking to get him
inside

BECK
There probably wasnt anything
wrong with his suit

WILLIE
Stillyou did the right thing

She turns off toward the Swamp leaving Beck with the tiny
but honest compliment He savors it

THE SWAMP - LATER

The Swamp (where DeJesus came up) is ankle deep in greasy
bilgewater The door slides open Willie enters and
switches on a bank of fluorescent lights The room is
spooky even with the lights The giant machine suits we
saw earlier outside hang from racks like sleeping monsters

Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a
motorized screwdriver a power wrench a long-necked
laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked
screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the
control switch and hits the START button

NNNNNNNNNN A motor moves one of the suits along the track
toward Willie As it turns the corner toward us we see it
says DEJESUS

DOCS OFFICE - SAME

Beck opens the door to Docs quarters and we see Doc putting
on a fresh shirt A man in his 50s he must have once been
quite handsome and intelligent but has now gone to seed

boc
I must have dozed off

Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad
Whiskey He picks it up

DOC (contd)
Snakebite medicineNever
pack my bag without it

Beck doesnt smile He puts the bottle back down and Doc
watches him in the mirror

BECK
Are you planning on working tomorrow

boc
Well Ill be on the golf course
in the morning Then if I dont
have any babies to deliver--
BECK

(cutting him off)
We almost had an accident today
DeJesus suit

The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck

boc
You got something to say to me son

Beck definitely has something to say but confronted he
falters

BECK
II think its important to
have the second officer on deck

Doc smiles and goes back to buttoning his shirt

boc
Ill keep it to nine holes
in the morning

THE DORMITORY - SAME

Small but functional The bunks can be closed-off with a
privacy door Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls
of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an
otherwise sterile environment

Willies bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary
maps Sixpacks privacy door has a bumper sticker which
proclaims TIT MAY BE FAT BUT YOURE UGLY AND I CAN DIET
DeJesus has posters of the Alps and the Rockies Bowmans
has clipped pages from Gourmet of meals she dreams for
Cobbs has nothing as if perfectly content to be where he
is instead of somewhere else Inside Jones bunk is an
indoor basketball goal

Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a
sponge and pail Sixpack pauses and smirks his eyes on
Bowmans chest

SIXPACK
Christwhat a pair

BOWMAN
(sharply)
What was that Whatd you say

SIXPACK
I said What a pair the

boy wonder Shack Boss and his

drunken doctor buddy make
(innocently)

Why What did ya think I said

CORRIDOR A - SAME

Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor unfastening a big
plate on the floor with a power wrench Overhead a huge
plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization
system The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire
exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack

Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the
floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark
and wet Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is
much louder and sinister

JONES
Listen to it for Christsake

COBB
Ah its just old like me
You dont see the Doc opening
me up every time I get a new creak
in my jointsI say as long as
its recycling the air let
the next shift deal with it
But long as were here

He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops
it down into the wet darkness without hesitating he climbs
down stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones Jones
seems in no hurry to accompany him

COBB (contd)
You gonna sit there on your
butt or give me a hand

Jones reluctantly starts down after him
BECKS QUARTERS - SAME

Beck in his quarters He seems to be talking to himself but
as we move around him we see he is talking to a video
monitor On screen we see MARTIN 30s a slick
bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp whose face is
all we see on the video monitor

BECK
Two hundred and fifty-two
tons of Magnesium and 15 tons
of Sodium

MARTIN
(taking notes)
Sounds like a good week Beck
In factI put your folder
in front of the Vice President
of District Operations last night

Beck stops Martin notices his concern

MARTIN (contd)
Youre good executive timber
Beck A lot of management trainees
wash out when they have to go under
for their first tour But youve done well

BECK
(smiles relieved)
Thank you Martin

MARTIN
Dont thank me yet but it is
important to know where youre
going and who your friends are
Know what I mean

He stares hard at Beck but doesnt wait for an answer

MARTIN (contd)
The one thing Ive learned in
this company is you cant have
enough friends Its the only
way to survive

CLOSE ON A BOOM BOX LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denvers
Rocky Mountain High

DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he
works on the intercom system He finishes closing a metal
box which says ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS

SWAMP - SAME

ON WILLIE She has connected DeJesus suit to the diagnostic
computer and is going through the computerized
checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of
possible problems
WILLIE
(to herself)
Probably a short

Suddenly the computer pauses on one It says Electrical
Short

WILLIE (contd)
Good guess Williams

She types in a help command and the computer screen
displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most
Electrical Engineers baffled Willie hardly bats an eye

WILLIE (contd)
Piece of cake

he immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus suit and
ulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt With
wo quick spot welds she repairs the short then replaces

he panel Finished Willie presses the control switch and
he suits begin to move along the track A new suit rounds
he corner toward us It says SIXPACK

ttt ton

THE BILGE - SAME

The walls are dark and moist Water drips from the pipes
The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans
over and hands Cobb another tool Crouched in the humming
machinery Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy
hand kneads it a couple of times then grins at Jones

COBB
Okay watch this

THE SWAMP - SAME

The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound
in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops
directly in front of Willie She reaches up to open the
pocket latch when she stopslistening THE NOISE IN THE
AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED

THE BILGE - SAME

Jones looks incredulously at Cobb He cant believe thats
all it took Cobb starts gathering up the tools

JONES
So thats all you do

COBB
Shhhhdont tell no one
(winks)
Job security

THE SWAMP - SAME

In the gloomy silence Willie reaches for the hinged pocket
in the waist of Sixpacks suit Some water drips out She
pushes the spring a second time The pocket opens
Nothing

WILLIE
(miffed)
Nothing wrong with this

SUDDENLY THE HIDEOUS SEA SPIDER SPRINGS OUT onto the
workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie She
backs away and it drops into the water at her feet

THE DORMITORY

Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door then to
Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead

WILLIES VOICE(OC)
(over intercom)
Fuck you Sixpack You think
youre funny Youre not funny

ON BECK
He hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom

BECK
This is Beck Is there a
problem Williams

SWAMP

Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her
as Becks words come over the PA Ignoring Beck she
watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings
the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS
skewering it She presses the intercom button and lifts the
skewered sea spider out of the water

WILLIE

(to Beck)
A little problem sirbut Ive
got a handle on it now

TIME CUT TO
THE MESS - LATER

BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches
stock prices scroll across the screen Every so often she
freezes a stock and types the command INFO The screen
immediately changes to a financial report of the company in
question as if prepared by a broker In a matter of seconds
Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company

Across the room from her Willie exercises with dumbbells
while she studies an astronaut training manual She looks up
at Bowman

WILLIE
Made your million yet

BOWMAN
(studying the screen)
Not yet

WILLIE
Hows TransOcean doing

This causes Bowman to turn and look at Willie

BOWMAN
You got money in this tub

WILLIE
I signed-up for the stock option

Bowman shakes her head and goes back to the computer and
types in TransOcean Corp

DORMITORY

ON COBB He lies on his bunk under a sunlamp but wears a
T-shirt and long pants DeJesus does a jigsaw puzzle of a
snow covered Swiss mountain scene

DEJESUS
Hey man you know that in
Switzerland--and this countrys
the size of East LA okay--they
speak 54 different dialects
Fifty-four

COBB
Who cares

DEJESUS

place When I get out of here

little snow covered chalet warm

He looks up and sees Cobbs sunbathing attire and laughs

DEJESUS
Hey CobbMan why dont you
take off your shirt and pants

what youre going to wear at the
beach

COBB

(sharply)
This is what I wear at the
beach goddamnit

MESS - SAME

COMPUTER SCREEN The report appears on screen with a
capsulized history of the TransOcean company its philosophy
and growth plans and most current financial report A final
column called insider tips says

BOWMAN

(reading)
Major development in
South Indian Ocean set for
fall of 2010

(to Willie)
That sounds interesting but theyre
too tied to their holdings Remember
a year ago when they lost that tanker
The bottom fell out of their stock and
I lost a bloody fortune Thats
when I decided to diversify

Willie looks at Bowman a moment then keeps exercising

WILLIE
You take your money too

BOWMAN

(sharply)
Youre damn right I do Five
years down here and Ill pull

SIXPACKS VOICE(OS)
Fun Somebody talking fun

They look up to see Sixpack at the door to the Mess wearing
only a robe With a leer he stares at Willie exercising

SIXPACK (contd)
(saccharine sweet)
Hey Willie honeySorry about that

Willie doesnt bite she looks hard at Sixpack

WILLIE

Sixpack smirks He waves a copy of Penthouse opened to the
Pet of the Month and sings cheerfully

SIXPACK
(leaving)

CLANK BANK CLUNK A coke can tumbles noisily from the
Coke machine Jones retrieves two cans of Coke and comes
out of the Galley with a snack He stops in front of
Bowman and the computer

They grin at each other--a standing joke and Jones leaves
DORMITORY

Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of
Coke across the room to DeJesus

JONES
Hey Hazy We got a day off
tomorrow Kemosabi Lets get
shit-faced

DEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of
carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp

JONES (cont d)
How about you brother Cobb
Little Wild Turkey

Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head

DEJESUS
No man Cobb is a Chivas drinker
from way back Aint that right
Cobbie

Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes
Cobb turns and watches them This is obviously a nightly
ritual

COBB
You guys are crazy What

game for

DEJESUS

(acting drunk)
What game CobbIm on

COBB

INT SIXPACKS BUNK - SAME

CLOSE ON The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the
centerfold her body twisted into an awkward position
representing mad desire

Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the
photo

SIXPACK
Oh Darlincome sit on
my face

He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS The
SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder dead

Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head
against the roof of the bunk then stumbles out screaming
He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams
in more pain

The whole dorm looks up amazed Cobb takes off his
sunglasses even Jones and DeJesus temporarily sober up to
stare

SIXPACK
That bitch

MESS

Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider He
points angrily at his bleeding foot Jones and DeJesus move
up to watch

SIXPACK
(moving into room)
Bitch Look what you did

WILLIE

(imitating Sixpack)
Sorry darlingJust thought a
little humor would loosen us all
upyou know

Everyone laughs but Sixpack He has revenge in his eyes
He holds out the ugly limp creature and advances toward
Willie

SIXPACK
You think youre so funny
Wait till you taste this
As he pushes the dead creature into her face BECKS VOICE
behind him makes him freeze

BECKS VOICE(0OS)
Thats enough

Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway

SIXPACK
Look at my foot sir This

CLOSE ON BLACKBOARD MESS - MORNING

SCREECH Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes 2 in
place of yesterdays 3 over the neatly lettered words
Days Till Pickup

Jones sitting next to Cobb looks up from his tray of
cereal and holds his head in mock misery

JONES
Oooooh Damn Not so loud
Turn down the music

COBB
What music There aint no
music
DeJesus enters holding his head and sits on the other side
of Cobb

DEJESUS
Oooooh

Cobb looks from one man to the other realizing what theyre
doing

COBB
You know its really crazy to
pretend to be drunk but its
fucking insane to pretend
to have a hangover

BOWMAN

(to Jones and DeJesus)
Your hangovers made you miss
the Sixpack Good Morning Show

(imitating Sixpack)
No goddamn boy is going to make

UNDERWATER - SAME

CLOSE ON A whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the
end of Willies mechanical suit arm Like a drill its
diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core
sample Its a sinister hand-attachment something Captain
Hook would have loved

Above her the ROV maneuvers into position for a better view
INSIDE THE SHACK CONTROL - SAME

Beck is in the control station staring at the video
monitors--the image from the ROV Willie removes a slender
instrument like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump
motion CHUNK CHUNKactivates an explosive charge She
puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off

BECK
Charge set

WILLIES VOICE (RADIO)
Charge set Backing off

(to the ROV)
Cmon Rover lets get out
of here

Like a good dog the ROV follows her to a safe position

ON MONITOR THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SPOT SUDDENLY THE
GROUND SHAKES VIOLENTLY ON THE MONITOR SCREEN--A MINI
EARTHQUAKE CHARGE

WILLIE RETURNS TO THE SITE OF THE CHARGE AND REINSERTS HER
DRILL EASILY REMOVING A TEST SAMPLE

Willie holds out the sample to the ROV so Beck can see
inside

INT CONTROL ROOM CLOSE ON BECKS ROV MONITOR
He stares at the image on the screen

SIXPACK

Suddenly Sixpacks foot hits some loose rock and slides
Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight
turning becoming smaller then disappearing as his radio
goes dead

INSIDE ON BECK

BECK

UNDERWATER

ON WILLIE She has stopped in her tracks All around her is
blackness Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness
WILLIE

Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet
The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers

BECKS VOICE brings Willie back

BECKS VOICE (RADIO)
Willie Whats going on

WILLIE

MESS

Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact
gym while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike

DEJESUS

out of our blood

Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight
suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in

BOWMAN
Sixpack is lost

CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Bowman Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room
where they are joined by Cobb

COBB
Werent they tied Theyre

giant tubers parting them with her hands as she moves
slowly

WILLIE

sight in front of her
WILLIES VOICE (RADIO)

INSIDE

All eyes suddenly go to the monitor A huge dark maw fills
the screen

BECK
AffirmativeWidening picture

The image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a
huge gash in the side of a sunken ship

BECK (contd)

(to DOC)
Tighten the picture on the
upper righthand corner

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR The picture zooms in on the corner
and Willies added light suddenly brings the letter M into
focus

Beck presses the red record button and pans the ROV slowly
across the bulkhead of the ship The next letter is an A
Then suddenly a Cyrillic letter appears then others

BECK

(to Willie)
Willie were giving you five
minutesafter that were coming in

WILLIES POV

Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of
her mask She moves along steadily down darkened corridors
She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges--a

cloud of sludge rises off the bottom The room looks empty

WILLIE
SixpackAnswer me

She throws open another door It also looks empty then
WHAM a grotesque ECHONODERM slams into her helmet Willie
bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light
into the room

WHAT SHE SEES The ships infirmary Broken glass
stainless steelthe light does strange things reflecting
sparkling

WILLIE (ON RADIO)
The infirmary

BECKS VOICE (RADIO)
Three minutes

Her helmet-mounted camera pans the room one more time then
as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white
in the corner--A LARGE HUMAN-LIKE SKELETON Willie doesnt
see it

INT THE CONTROL ROOM

CLOSE ON DOC He stares at the monitor screen Did he see
something or were his eyes playing tricks He looks across
the console and sees the videotape is recording

UNDERWATER
ON WILLIE She moves to the end of the hall It ends with
two doors

BECKS VOICE (RADIO)
One minute

Willie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on
her left SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--ITS SIXPACK His
mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the

ships huge safe

SIXPACK
(laughing)
Im rich honey Rich

THE SWAMP - LATER

The door to the Russian ships safe stands open BANG
BANG Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a
chisel While the others watch Sixpack pleads his case
with Beck

SIXPACK
Its all mine if Im on report
Otherwise you gotta take me off
report before you look at any more
Aint that right Cobbie

COBB
Youre on your own Sixpack you

DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box
and dumps the contents on the workbenchseveral wallets
wristwatches a pocket watch a wedding ringBowman who
stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory

BOWMAN
Personal effects

WILLIE

(considering

a watch)
Timex

She picks up something else a pack of soggy chewing gum and
tosses it to Cobb

WILLIE (contd)
Heres something for you Cobbie
JONES
(checking a wallet)
Russian moneyDont look like much

Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the
tableLife Savers candy a postcard of a fat Russian woman
in a bathing suit Bowman looks at it

BOWMAN
(grinning to
Sixpack)
Yeah Id say you can retire
with all this loot

SIXPACK
Shut up

Everyone chuckles More papers and a small book-shaped
object wrapped in plastic Jones unwraps it Its a video
tape He looks at the label

WILLIE
What is it

JONES

(reading)
Debbie Does Dallas

(looks up and

grins)
Hell its in Russian I cant
read it

boc

May I see it
Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it

DOC (contd)
Its a log of some sort

Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it
out--Papers more cheap watches

ON SIXPACK He notices something silver the size of a
paperback book under a stack of papers Discreetly he
covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off
the table out of sight

Jones opens the last box and something rolls across the
table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught
by DeJesus He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor
bottle

WILLIE
Vodka

COBB
What assholes they lock booze
in the safe

DEJESUS
Probably confiscated No
booze on board same as us

Doc turns the bottle around in DeJesus hand so he can read
the label

(eyeing the bottle)
Stolichnaya

Everyone looks at Doc

COBB
You read Russian

Cobb stares at him a second then

COBB

Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman

BECK

He lifts the bottle of Stolie out of DeJesus hands

safe

A disappointed crew watches Beck leave with the bottle Doc
stops him

BECK

RING CORRIDOR - LATER

The gloomy corridor outside the Infirmary It is empty
silent Suddenly the door to the Infirmary opens slightly
and Bowman peeks out Seeing the corridor is empty she
slips out with a a manila folder

Bowman hands the envelope to DeJesus whos grinning
delightedly

is of poor quality and water spotted

DOCS VOICE(OS)
(translating)
Another party last night More
Vodka The infirmary is filled
as it is I confiscate what
I can but I know the Government
Observers have more
Suddenly the captain hears a noise off-screen and goes to
the camera and turns it off The tape goes blank

ON DOC

He stops the tape and presses another button on the console
WILLIES VIDEO of the huge hole in the hull of the ship
appears on another screen

DOC (contd)
See that gash The way the
edges protrude inward is like
from a torpedo explosion It
couldnt have come from within
Like an accident

He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him and
has also been watching the tape Beck looks at Doc and
shrugs

BECK
What do you want me to say
That it all sounds mysterious

boc
These observers were doing something
A testI think they sank that ship
on purpose to cover up their mistakes

BECK
What mistakes

(he shakes his

head wearily)
Look I think its no big deal but
if you want to find out why this
ship sank have Maritime run a check

He gets up and goes to the door Doc watches him

boc
I did They have no record of
the wreck

(beat)
The Marshal Goloviev is now on
a tour in the Baltic Sea

Beck stops This is a mystery
CLOSE ON COMBINATION LOCK BECKS QUARTERS - SAME

Fingers fiddle with the combination He pulls on the
handle The safe doesnt budge

UPPER RING CORRIDOR

ON COBB Standing watch for DeJesus Suddenly the door to
the Control room opens and Beck walks out Cobb grabs a
walkie-talkie

COBB
Becks coming

BECKS QUARTERS ON DEJESUS

He hears Cobb and freezes He looks around--the cramped
quarters dont offer much in the way of hiding places

INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY

They react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the PA
ON COBB AND BECK CORRIDOR

Beck stops outside his door and sees Cobb

BECK
Something wrong Cobb

COBB

(struggling)
UhExcuse me sir its the air

BECK

COBB

(thinking fast)
Id really have to show it to

BECK

(beat)
All right

Cobb smiles he cant believe his luck then Beck holds up
the videotape

BECK (contd)
Just let me put this in
my safe

Before Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters
and steps inside

BECKS QUARTERS WE SEE no sign of DeJesus Cobb follows
into the room looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus

In the mirror to Becks bathroom Cobb spots DeJesus
pressing against the wall Cobb suddenly starts to sweat
bullets Beck quickly unlocks the safe opens it and puts
the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka

We see Cobbs reaction Beck turns

BECK
Something wrong

Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out
he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives
him a thumbs up

MESS - LATER

Five specimen cups filled with vodka Bowman takes hers and
looks at it questioningly Cobb watches the door for signs
of the officers

BOWMAN

notices Willie)
Hey Willie I got one served

Cobb Jones DeJesus Bowman and Sixpack grin and clink
glasses then knock back their vodka Afterwards we get
their reactions

JONES Looks concerned

BOWMAN Shakes her head somethings wrong

DEJESUS Cant get the taste off his tongue

COBB Seems totally satisfied

SIXPACK who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it
suddenly spits the vodka out

SIXPACK
Shit Its water

JONES
Beck switched it

DEJESUS
Can you beat that The sonof-
abitch doesnt trust us

Willie grins at her co-workers and Becks move and jogs out
into the corridor Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot
glass away and leaves

SIXPACK
That little turd If I
ever get the chance Ill
fix his ass

The others put down their glasses disappointedly except
Bowman She watches Sixpack

DORMITORY

SIXPACKS BUNK He closes his privacy door and hesitates as
if listening for the others then he removes a silver flask
with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the
Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull Suddenly WHAM

The Privacy door to Sixpacks bunk is slammed open
Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN

BOWMAN
Didnt I ever tell you vodka
was my favorite drink

She holds out her glass Sixpack looks around the Dorm
its empty then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot

CORRIDOR B

ON WILLIE She is jogging through the corridors Suddenly
there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE Willie stops and looks
through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor The
dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim
light The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp

As she passes the door she notices the light and stops Beck
stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with
the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside

He sees her

BECK
That was a loud one wasnt it

WILLIE
After a month of it youd think
Id be used to it

She moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock stopping
under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung
above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her
lean body easily doing the exercises

BECK
(watching her)
Hows astronaut training

WILLIE
Why You going to give me hard
time like the others

BECK

BECK

posed to hone leadership skills

adventure in the Control Room

BECK
You think I should hang around

WILLIE
Well I always heard you dont

The crew increases its bitching

COBB

Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends
the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit
DeJesus and Jones share a look Bowman and Willie watch him
carefully As Becks suit stops in front of him the room is
quiet they cant believe their eyes Awkwardly Beck

tries to get into his suit Cobb breaks the silence

COBB
Excuse me sir

BECK

INT THE INFIRMARY - SAME

Doc and Sixpack Doc takes a blood sample seals it and
opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is
stored in a refrigerated unit The plastic bags of blood
are labeled with the various crew members names

Sixpack watches him from the examination table He is
shivering violently and scared

SIXPACK
(hes losing it)
Please DocIm coldI hurt

We see a change in Docs demeanor He is suddenly needed
and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to
the challenge

boc
Im just going to take a tiny
piece of skin to look at under

the microscopeAfterwards Ill
give you a sedative

Skillfully Doc takes a skin sample Sixpack screams
VIEW THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE

An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity
We see it literally spreading before our eyes
ON DOC

He leans back from the microscope There is awe on his face
for the first time since first year medical studies--and
there is fear of the unknown He looks over his shoulder at
Sixpack his shivering has stopped he lies still on the
table

UNDERWATER

Lights move in the blackness but there is an order to the
actions and a crispness to the voices People doing work
that is moving sharply Pride in what theyre doing

DEJESUS
Okay number 23s full

BECK

The mood is happy Like a high school football locker room
after a winning game DeJesus climbs out of his suit and
slaps Beck on the shoulder

DEJESUS
Good work out there Mr Becky

Beck obviously pleased looks at the others Jones sums up
the feelings of the entire group

JONES

Beck hesitates then puts on the mask
SICK ROOM

As Beck enters masked Sixpacks back is to him under the
sheets Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the
sight The black splotches have nearly all grown together
His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed Most
dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become
flared and elongated Though not bleeding the open veins
are visible

INFIRMARY

Doc pours some bourbon in a glass and takes a sip Beck
enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet

BECK
The mask is because you think

INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL

INSERT The chapter hes on says BODY DISPOSAL AT SEA
The face of Martin stares back at us

MARTIN
Well according to Maritime law
you as commander of the Shack
have the authority to dispose of
the body However the company
doesnt want you to do that

BECK
What you dont understand is that
my crew is in jeopardy

MARTIN
But you dont have any proof

this disease is contagious do
you

BECK

MARTIN
Beck trust me If the company
felt that you or your crew were
in any danger we would authorize
an immediate emergency pickup

BECK

MARTIN

Unfortunately We cant

He picks up a sheet of computer paper

MARTIN (contd)
There is a typhoon about 600
miles off the coast of Baja

Company doesnt want to lose
you folks or an emergency ship

They leave Bowman GROANING on the examination table and head
back to the main corridor As they leave WE HOLD ON the
door to the sick room behind Bowman

Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain Carefully
she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to
throw up

CLOSE ON BOWMAN

At the sink in the infirmary She rinses her face in the
sink and pulls back her hair suddenly she stops and brings
her hands in front of her face

INSERT HER HANDS Huge clumps of hair have come out in her
hands And then she sees her hands themselves Scaly

BOWMAN

She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room Slowly
she goes to the door and enters

LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the
Infirmary with Jones He opens the door and freezes

WHAT HE SEES The examination table where Jones left her is
empty The room deserted

JONES

(pointing to

examination table)
I left her here

DOC comes up behind them then turns He hears to a HISSING
SOUND down the ring corridor He turns from the others and
moves slowly toward the noise

SHOWER ROOM

Doc enters the shower room full of steam and the SOUND OF
WATER

boc
Bowman

There is no answer and he moves toward the shower
boc
Bowman Its Doc Im here

to help you

The water continues to run No answer Carefully Doc
opens the shower door

WHAT HE SEES Bowman Dead Her wrists have been cut and
blood swirls down the drain

Doc sadly squats down beside her The death effects him
greatly He feels helpless then suddenly his eyes widen
and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowmans limp arm
turning it supine There running the length of the arm WE
SEE the black scales

INFIRMARY

Jones and Beck lay Bowmans body carefully onto the
examination table in the infirmary Through the Sick Room
door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack Doc covers
Bowman with a sheet as

WE CUT TO
THE MESS - LATER

The remaining crew Doc and Beck assembled in the Mess
Doc sits quietly almost in a daze

BECK
I cant tell you much about

show any symptoms

DEJESUS

BECK
Noshe killed herself

ON WILLIE the news hits her hard

JONES

DEJESUS

JONES
Twelve hours

COBB
At least we get time and
a half Thats in the contract

JONES
Fuck double pay man I

Their argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the
corridor A THUMP The crew stops their grumbling and
listens A moment later we hear another THUMP Beck looks
at Jones

BECK

(motions for Jones

to come with him)
Jones

(to the others)
Stay here

RING CORRIDOR

Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the
sound is coming from Outside the door they hear it once
more THUMP

Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the
examination table is empty Beck goes to the Sick room and
stops in the doorway Jones moves behind him and his eyes
suddenly widen

WHAT THEY SEE Both bodies now are in a motionless hideous
conglomeration on the the table

SLAM CUT TO
CLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER

ZZZZZZZZ2Z22Z222 It is quickly pulled shut running the
length of a heavy plastic bag closing both bodies inside

INT CORRIDOR B - LATER

Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb Jones DeJesus
Beck and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the
zippered bodybag Now well over three hundred pounds the
bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to
transport
DEJESUS
Cmon Cobbyoure slacking

COBB
(angrily)
I aint goddamnitIts
Jones

Before Jones can argue Beck cuts them off

BECK
Shut up all of you

COBB
Mr Beck the contract states that
no body can be disposed of without
authorization of---

JONES
Fuck the contract man

The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by
the Lift Lock Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side
of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the package Like
dominoes Willie also looses her grip then DeJesus The
bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even
harder for everyone to get a handhold

BECK (contd)
CmonLift

The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to
their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesuss face

DEJESUS
HeyI feel something
Its moving Hes alive

COBB
I feel it tooSomeones trying
to get out

Cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for
the zipper

JONES
Cobb whatre you doing

COBS
But he aint dead He aint
dead
BECK
Cobb Stop

But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag
Beck tries to stop him when suddenly WHAM a DARK
APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a
pressurized firehose It beats wildly for several second
then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm

While Cobb screams in pain Beck yanks the appendage off
Cobbs arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a
sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a
dagger

COBB
It bit me It bit me

While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage
Doc rushes to the Lift Lock

DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag
into the Lift Lock

JONES
Push Hazy

The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its
occupant Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just
as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places A tear RIPS
OPEN next to Jones head revealing the head of BOWMAN her
vacant eyes only inches from Jones face

JONES
Oh Jesus Christ I aint
never gonna sleep again

Suddenly a WHINING NOISE sounds behind them Beck looks
back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated
underwater chain saw Hes clearly intending to cut the
Creature with the whirring blade

BECK
No

COBB
It bit me

DEJESUS
Its Sixpack

COBB

Im going to kill it
DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to
wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock The bag suddenly
splits and a scaly arm protrudes It reaches out grabbing
DeJesus Beck pulls him free and yells

BECK
Close the Lock Now

Doc hits the lever The elevator doesnt move
RRRRRRIIIIIPPP A scaly leg rips out of the body bag

BECK (contd)
Hit it again

Doc hits the elevator switch again harder

NNNNNNN The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying
SCREAM rises from the Lock

CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK

The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door
disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water

BECK (contd)
Flush it

Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown
out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock the wails of Cobb and the
splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory
muscle which slip silently and undetected under the
workbench

A second later the elevator returns empty silent
bloodstained

Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock The
exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the
flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it
grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of
the Shack lightsinto the darkness

Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew Willie Jones
DeJesus Doc look like wet-suited butchers Splattered in
blood numbed by the experience they are brought together
by having simply survived Jones holds up Willie DeJesus
leans against the bulkhead In the far corner Cobb sobs
quietly

SHOWERS - LATER
Clouds of steam Vaguely seen through the steam Willie is
scrubbing herself almost desperately as though the
spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her
skin Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her
head against the wall of the shower stall

DORMITORY - SAME

Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpacks bunk
After some digging which produces five months supply of
pornography the empty flask clatters to the floor Beck
picks it up

BECK
I think we just found our
problem

MESS - LATER

Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand Jones
and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for
a run There is a feeling of anger among them

DEJESUS
Serves his ass right to get
it Motherfucker brings that
shit onboard I hope his
fucking ass rots in the sea and
is shit upon by the fish

JONES
Fucker could have gotten us
all killed

COBB

He knew better than that

Willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all
coldly

WILLIE
You guys sure werent so holy
when you were shooting that
vodkaIt could have been you

She gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor
THE RUSSIAN SHIP

WE ARE MOVING along the ships corridor that Willie walked
looking for Sixpack
WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE
CONTROL ROOM

Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willies search for Sixpack
on the Russian ship On the monitor screen we see Willies
POV of the infirmary The light dances off the broken glass
as she turns then the flash of white we saw before as the
light moves out into the corridor

boc
Hold it Rewind it

Beck rewinds it

ON SCREEN we see the scene again Light dancing off the
cabinets As the light starts to turn--

boc
Stop it

Beck pauses the tape We see nothing Doc is confused

boc
Back it up slowly

Beck does and we watch Docs face as he stares intently at
the screen Suddenly he sees it

boc
There

ON SCREEN We see it Caught in the turn of the camera now
frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains
of aman Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man
Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than
normal But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that
especially catches our attention

MESS - SAME
ON A BEAUTIFUL BAVARIAN SETTING

as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is
actually one of DeJesus jigsaw puzzles He takes a piece
of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and
places it perfectly into position on the puzzle Jones
watches him amazed

DEJESUS
You know that Innsbruck
has 64 square miles of ski
slopes man Think about that
Sixty-four square miles

He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits
it into place as Jones watches Its blowing Jones mind

JONES
Howd you do that

DEJESUS
What ThatIve done this
one before You hungry Im
hungry

He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in
amazement

JONES
Hungry After what we just
went through I may never
eat again

ON WILLIE

She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp The Shack
CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing
below her feet It is dark down there Her feet pound off
the metal grating

LOW ANGLE We watch Willie from below as she jogs past THEN
WE TILT DOWN to the dark still water of the bilge Suddenly
something stirs in the water--a ripple like a trout ina
stream

CONTROL ROOM - SAME

Using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions
of the skull on the videotape Doc enters these measurements
as they are read off to him by Beck As each of the
measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins
to appear on the computer screen followed by a name
DANAKIL MAN

BECK
They found this

boc
No I think they isolated
him in genetic engineering
Homo aquaticus

BECK
ON WILLIE

running

Was there such a thing

boc
Danakil manone of our
ancestors Named for the
Danakil Alps in Ethiopia

BECK
Not exactly a big ocean
country

boc

It was when it counted a couple
of million years ago when the
seas came in and drove us into
the water Most homo sapiens
didnt make itDanakil man
adapted

She jogs past the machine room Looking in
machines seem alive pulsing the beating heart of the
Shack There is something else though

in there watching her

CONTROL ROOM

On Doc

boc
Some say thats why were
basically hairless for less
water resistance faster swimming
speeds

BECK
But what about those scales
or that leech-like thing that
bit Cobb

DOC
Why stop with just one aspect

of marine life Why not incorporate

the best genetic components the
ocean has to offer

BECK

(pointing to screen)
Well if they were perfecting an
aquaman then whys there a dead

one onboard that Russian ship Why

the

We feel something
isnt he out swimming around

Doc looks up at the image on the screen The huge skull
stares back hauntingly

boc

(beat)
He obviously lacked something
in his environment

DORMITORY - SAME

ON COBB He sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage
He turns on an overhead reading light and looks again
Suddenly a voice startles him

JONES VOICE
Turned black yet

At first startled Cobb recovers and answers sharply

COBS
That aint funny

JONES
Relax Cobb If it was
going to turn it would have
done its trick by now

COBB
Thats easy for you to say
You aint the one that got bit

Jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on
Cobbs bunk He picks it up and we see a photo of Cobbs
family

JONES
Dont tell me youre getting
soft on us Cobbie Youre
the fellow who always said--

Cobb snatches the photo back from Jones and glares at him
with the same old hard Cobb look

COBB
Nothings changed goddamnit

Jones leaves and Cobb waits till he is gone then looks back
at his photo His look changes softening Absently he
scratches his bandage
SWAMP

Willie enters and checks her running time on her watch She
bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly

OVERHEAD SHOT

WE are watching her from above For a moment she is quiet
as if listening for a noise somewhere in the Swamp She
looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the
Workbench

MESS - SAME

DeJesus looking for food In the gloom of fluorescent
lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a
snack

He notices that the floors wet near the sink He frowns
and hears a SMALL NOISE like something shifting slightly
He moves to investigate crouching low peeking into the
shadows under the sink into a litter of cleanser bottles
pails ragsAll he can see are shadows He looks more
closely actually sticking his head under the sink when

SUDDENLY SOMETHING TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND DEJESUS
JUMPS BUMPING HIS HEAD ON THE SINK AS HE WHIRLS TO SEE

JONES looming over his shoulder looking down at him

JONES
Man everybody is jumpy
What are you doing

Not fully recovered from the start DeJesus rubs his bruised
head

DEJESUS
Getting some food

JONES
Under there

DeJesus gets to his feet points at the water under the
sink

DEJESUS
Look Water

JONES
Probably the plumbing You
gonna make me finish that puzzle
by myself or what

DeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at
Jones

DEJESUS
No Ill be right there

He looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the
galley Something is missing

DEJESUS
(to himself)
Mustard Need mustard

He opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty

DEJESUS
(muttering to himself)
Sixpack

He throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next
to the refrigerator for a new jar and reaches inside

SUDDENLY LIKE A SNAKE A TWO FOOT CHUNK OF MUSCLE ATTACHES
TO DEJESUSS WRIST WITH HIS FREE HAND DEJESUS TRIES TO RIP
THE TWISTING WRITHING THING OFF PULLING AT IT HE REVEALS
PART OF SIXPACKS FACE--ONE EYE AND PART OF HIS
MOUTH--UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE

DeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and
causing an avalanche of pots and pans

DEJESUS
(in pain)
Ahhh
INSIDE THE MESS

Jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when
he hears THE CLATTER OF POTS AND PANS

JONES
Hey Hazywhatre you doing
nowcooking

There is no answer and Jones looks up

JONES (cont d)
(concerned)
Hazy
He goes to the door and looks in His eyes widen at the
sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing
hunk of muscle

JONES (cont d)
Holy shit

DEJESUS
Help me Jonesy Oh God
help me Its getting inside
me I can feel it

He keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his
friend

JONES
Hazy pleaseIm going to
get you some help manjust

Jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to
the Galley He closes it rushing through into the Mess to
the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb

COBB
Whats going on

JONES
Its HazyIts got him
Stay here and dont let him
out Im going to get the Doc

Jones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door Cobb watches
him go As the noise in the Mess intensifies we hear

banging on the door then DeJesus anguished cries

DEJESUS
Help me Help me

Cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm
UPPER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

INT THE LOWER B CORRIDOR - SAME

Jones and Beck move down the spooky corridor toward the
Swamp Overhead water moves through the desalinization
conduit Jones eyes it warily

SWAMP

They enter the quiet Swamp The suits hang silently like
sleeping monsters Beck steps into the equipment room

Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him
Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly He reaches the
end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw
Willie doing chin-ups He looks down and sees her headband
floating in the bilgewater

JONES
Willie

Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him

WILLIE
Yeah

The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure he
stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie
drops from the bar laughing

WILLIE

(grinning)
What on earths the matter
with you

JONES
I ought to smack your face

Willie picks up the strain in Jones voice her smile fades

WILLIE
Whats wrong

JONES
DeJesusIts got him
THE EQUIPMENT ROOM - SAME

Jones Willie and Beck move quickly Beck pulls a portable
laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits
and attaches a portable power unit to the back Turning it
on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon

Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated
container transporters Beck notices and then looks up at
Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle
pumpearthquake device we saw Willie use earlier

BECK
I thought they were your friends

JONES
Were Doss were

Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from
him

BECK
You fire that in here and
youll bring the whole place
down

Jones thinks about it for a moment then reaches for one of
the Acetylene tanks He lights the end of it and a long
blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp
Jones grins

INFIRMARY - SAME

Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary Doc goes into his
office He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer
and then looks up through the levolor blinds into the
infirmary What he sees upsets him

INT SWAMP - SAME

He looks back to Beck concerned
JONES (cont d)

BECK
No its not going through

DeJesus fixed that

JONES
(beat realizing)
He did

INFIRMARY - SAME

Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to
the storage counter across the room--where the blood is
stored WE SEE what disturbed himthe door to the
refrigeration unit is ajar Doc opens the door to the
cabinet The plastic bags are now empty Each one has been
drained

LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

Cobb moves out of the Infirmary carefully down the eerie
corridor his mining tool in front of him for security
There is a sinister feel to the place Each step only
reveals a little bit of space ahead of him Suddenly he
stops In front of him across the hall a cabinet which
says ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS is torn open It is where
DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before

CLOSE ON THE CABINET

The door is shattered Carefully Cobb opens the door and
WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire
system has been disabled

Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY
HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping
COBB and sending his weapon to the floor Cobb turns
directly into

THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH Its sharp teeth shine in the light
poised to strike

Cobbs eyes closed screams like a maniac waiting for the
tentacle to attack Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes
in the corridor

COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone Doc is
holding the smoking mining drill his eyes glazed as if he
has seen the devil itself

COBB
What happened
boc
(absently)
Italmost got you

COBB
What was it

Doc shakes his head dumbly He is in total shock
THE MESS

The remaining group is assembled around the table Jones

watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers He
listens

COBS

(excitedly)

I saw it Its big

BECK
Big

JONES
Bigger than DeJesus How

boc
Its had a meal

He holds out the empty blood bags A change has come over
Doc since Bowmans death The experience has slightly
deadened him

WILLIE
It needs blood

JONES
Fucking greatYou telling
me we got a fucking dracula
in here with us

boc
It would explain the suction-
like appendages

JONES
Like a leech

BECK
Thats why theres a dead one
on the ship It ran out of blood
JONES
What dead one on the ship

He looks from Doc to Beck

JONES (cont d)

(sharply)
Someone want to let the rank
and file in on your little
secret

Doc looks at Beck then Jones

boc
The monster appears to be
a genetic aberration

JONES
No fuckin lie

DOC
It has many traits of deep
sea marine liferegeneration

scales gills even a period

of dormancy

(more to Beck)

but the fact that it remembered
where the plasma was stored or
where the communication wiring was
may imply that it has some other
quality

COBB
(panicky)
WhatWhat

Beck locks eyes with Doc

BECK

(to Doc)
That it acquires intelligence
from its victims

DOC
Intelligence may not be the right
word

JONES

Fuck semantics Doc

You saying its like part
DeJesus part Sixpack part
Bowman
boc
(tiredly)
I dont know Im guessing

COBB

(losing it)
I say we should go get in the
escape bubbles and get the hell
out of here

JONES
And hit the surface in the
middle of a typhoonNo thank you
Ill take my chance down here

Willie looks at Beck

WILLIE
What can we do

BECK
Our only chance is to lure
it to the Swamp and flush it
like we did the other

COBB
And howre we going to do that

Beck checks his flamethrower and looks at Jones

TIME CUT TO
THE MESS - LATER
ON BECK He flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it WE
SEE a half-pint of blood in a bag held by Doc He secures

it and hands it back to Beck

boc
Be careful with it

BECK
Dont worry I dont want to
give up any more

He looks over at Jones who watches the door Jones looks
back and nods The coast is clear

bandage Doc notices

boc
Still bothering you

Cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash

INSERT COBBS WOUND Pink and healing

boc
Looks good to me Ill re-bandage

He looks at Willie

ladder to the Upper Level instead

CLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL
a grisly sight

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag
of Becks blood Beck stops the drip and moves on into the
darkness of the corridor

Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of
the Control room His face lit by the computer monitor He
types furiously

DOC pauses looking at the message then moves his hand to
the SEND command and presses it

THE MESS - LATER

Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut He
smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor The tired look
now gone from his eyes He seems revitalized

boc
There good as new Just
keep your paws off of it
(to Willie)
Do you have the new bandage ready

She nods Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his
arm to let Willie put the new bandage on As Cobbs arm
comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his
shirt Willie stops just before applying the bandage The
movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the
cloth Cobb whitensbreaks out in a sweat Willie backs
off

WILLIE
DocDoc

She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a
leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobbs waist Its razor
sharp proboscis punctures Docs chest right at the heart and
the leach mouth with its hundreds of teeth attaches with
vacuum-like suction

No

away

It starts down the corridor toward its prey--Beck

A little behind him with the homemade flamethrower Jones
waits in the shadows Suddenly Beck hears something

BECK

(whispers)
I hear something Dont fire

Jones moves a little farther back

It moves steadily toward the door moving right to the
doorway Carefully it moves a dark horrible hand-like
appendage inside the doorframe

ON BECK AND JONES
poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing

WILLIES VOICE(OS)
Beck Jones

ON WILLIE

She turns the corner and freezes There less than ten feet
away is the Creature A tentacle whips excitedly like a
tail

WILLIE
Oh God

AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie Beck suddenly
closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creatures hand
trapping it vise-like in the door

BECK
Run Willie Run

The Creature throws back its head and SCREAMS in pain as the
heavy door severs its appendage

ON BECK AND JONES

As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them
Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls
like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move

JONES
Well done Just like
momma makes ‘em

Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty Willie and the
creature are gone

ON WILLIE RUNNING

She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner
path toward Corridor A Ina full run now every panel
and instrument looks even more sinister--where is CobbDoc
CREATURE ---

ON THE DEJESUS CREATURES SEVERED APPENDAGE

As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump
suddenly sprout a new appendage Like a starfish it grows
another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost

ON WILLIE

She turns down Corridor A A NOISE overhead in the water
conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM
REACHES OUT FROM THE SHADOWS AND PULLS HER INTO THE DARK
DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR----IT IS JONES He pulls her
between him and Beck in the shadows

BECK
(whispered)
Wheres Cobb and Doc

WILLIE

(recovering)
Cobbs cutIt was in him
It got Doc

JONES

Oh man thats just great

BECK
Cmon

CONTROL ROOM
Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie It is empty

BECK
Lock the door

Jones rolls the large vault-like door closed and locks them
Beck goes to the console and checks the instruments
Suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his
tracks A red light blinks ominously on the console

BECK
Shit He sent them all

WILLIE
The escape bubbles

She and Jones stop in front of Docs console
JONES
(gravely)
Look at this

Beck looks at Docs computer screen

ON SCREEN WE SEE DOCS MESSAGE hope that our sacrifice
will mean that the human race will never know this awful
mutation

WILLIE
What is it

JONES
The good doctor signed our
death warrant

SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR LIKE A
HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING
TO BREAK IT DOWN Jones readies his weapon but just as
suddenly the BANGING STOPS Beck Willie and Jones all
nervously exchange looks

WILLIE
Well at least were safe inside
here

JONES

For how long
Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types ina
message WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN SHACK SIX REPORTING
PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---

SUDDENLY MARTINS FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN

MARTIN
Thank goodness youre still
alive

JONES

(yells nervously
at the screen)
Hey man you better get
your ass out here right now
and get us You hear me
motherfucker Right now

Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them

MARTIN
Please relax Mr Jones Every-
thing is under control Naturally
when we received Dr Warrens
message we were concerned but
would never have deserted you

Jones lets out a breath Willie stares straight at the
screen

WILLIE
When are you coming for us

MARTIN
(smiles nervously)

Well thats the bad news

The typhoon did turn your way
(he looks at weather
printout)

Right now it is on a course--

JONES
Just answer the question man

MARTIN
(beat)
Hopefully in the next 48 hours

BECK
Forty-eight hours

MARTIN
I realize you must have gone
through hell--

JONES
Gone Man were still here

MARTIN
(firmly)
I cant change the weather
Try to get some rest Ill
keep you posted

He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck
Jones and Willie goes blank

BECK
Hes right Why dont you get some
rest Ill stand the first watch

TIME CUT TO
CONTROL ROOM - LATER

Jones sits near the vent sound asleep his weapon across
his stomach Near him Willie lies still eyes open She
watches Beck across the room standing at the window

He stares outside into the darkness for a moment then
as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the

blank computer screen

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

Request weather summaries January 14-21 The cursor
blinks back ominously then races across the screen FILE
CLOSED

BECK

(to himself)
Martin you asshole

Suddenly he hears a voice behind him

WILLIE
They know dont they

BECK

(quietly)
YeahI think theyre just
deciding what to do with us

WILLIE
Maybe they already have

She moves into Docs seat in front of the console and calls
up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring
earlier

ON SCREEN WE SEE Stock prices
Willie types in a series of commands

BECK
What are you doing

WILLIE
Seeing how my stocks doing

ON SCREEN The words TransOcean Corp The capsulized report
comes up on screen TransOcean Corp took a bath on world
markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was
revealed to investors The Board of Directors
WILLIE
(impatiently)

She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the
words

THE SCREEN accident took place in Shack Six Southeast
Sector of Pacific Zone 10Seven dead All bodies
missing Their names follow

ON WILLIE as her name comes up she shivers

BECK
I cant believe theyd
just leave us

A voice behind them causes them to turn

JONES
Welcome to the union boss
Were all expendable

He is now awake He sits up against the air vent Suddenly
Beck listens the room is deathly silent He looks over to
the air vent Jones is listening also

WILLIE
What is it

JONES
The airs stopped

WHOOP WHOOP Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically
A blue light on the console blinks on and off It says
AIR Beck turns to the instruments

BECK
Were on backup air

WILLIE
How much time does that give
us

BECK

Less than an hour Its ruptured
an air duct

WILLIE
Cant we fix it
JONES
Therere twenty miles of
pipe in the bilge they
could have tapped-in anywhere

SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVENT HEARD IN A LONG TIME
The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED Jones and Beck home
in on the tell-tale noise

JONES
(almost to himself)
CobbJob security

He locks eyes with Beck

BECK
Theyre drawing us out

He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie
watches

WILLIE
You cant go out there thats
what they want

Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower

BECK
We dont have much choice
without air the internal
pressure will fall and--

JONES
CrunchImplosion

Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining
tools the laser-drill she powers-it up to check it Her
action stops both men and she catches their looks

WILLIE
You dont think Im sitting
in here do you

INT CORRIDOR A - SAME

Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor As
they move we suddenly hear a new sound DEEP LIKE DISTANT
THUNDER The sides of the shack tremble slightly

WILLIE
(low)
The shack
JONES
Shes wondering whats
happening Were losing
air faster than I thought

BECK
(to Jones)
Which way

Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor A
INT CORRIDOR A

The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the
flooring The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down
into the darkness Willie stands guard with the flame-
thrower

ON JONES He peers into the darkness below He wasnt a big
fan of the bilge even before the Creature now hes scared
shitless

BECK
Ill go first

Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs
down into the dark bilge Jones waits till hes at the
bottom then starts down behind him Willie looks back

WILLIE
Dont spend all day down
there

JONES
Dont fuckin worry I
aint

BILGE

From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF
ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM
As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light
into the eerie underground area

Pipes run overhead and on the walls A broken electrical
conduit sparks over their heads The floor is ankle deep in
greasy water They start toward the noise

ON WILLIE

Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall) Her eyes move
from one end of the corridor to the other not lingering
long enough to distract her Sweat runs down her face and
we hear another tremor in the Shack

WILLIE

(to herself

calming herself)
Okay Williamslets hear a
tune

(beat quietly

at first)
Off we gointo the wild
blue yonder

ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause She
catches her breath and starts again

WILLIE (contd)
flying high into the sky

She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the
wire mesh of the other wall) Was it something moving

BILGE

ON BECK He moves around a corner we recognize from before
with Jones and Cobbs repair Beck floods the area with
light and the break in the line is visible The pipe has
been torn from the wall it is totally unreparable Whats
worse electrical wires hang down showering sparks into the
water

JONES
Jesus Christ

BECK
Can you fix it

JONES
No way

BECK
Think Can we stop it
Block it up Shut down
the line somewhere Think

JONES
I am thinking man You
think I want to die I am
thinking I--

Suddenly his eyes widen Beck sees this and turns In his
light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK
FRAME OF THE COBBDOC CREATURE Its leech-like appendage
whipping in front of it like an excited cats tail Before
it can strike Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a
blast of flame from his flamethrower The CREATURE SCREAMS
and disappears

As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes
out sending the bilge into greater darkness

JONES
I hit it But I cant see
it Can you see it

BECK
(standing)
No

Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a
thought

JONES
The Swamp Theres an over-
ride switch in the Swamp

They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP out of the
darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones
arm The deadly proboscis which stabbed Cobb is poised
like a dagger about to be plunged into the black mans
thigh

JONES
(screams)
Ahhh

Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the
tentacle The unseen Creatures SCREAM echoes through the
Bilge Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the
ladder

BECK
HurryGet out

Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor
fifteen feet away moving closerteneightthen
suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the
ladder at them Beck ducks and leaps to the side He is
less than six feet from the Creature In the dim light WE
SEE it wickedly bare its teeth

Becks eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and
spot the exposed power cable The Creature steps forward
directly under the hole in the floor It is about to lunge
when a voice from above distracts it

WILLIES VOICE(OC)
Hey you

The Creature looks up and sees

ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING HER FLAMETHROWER
POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN SHE FIRES SENDING A SEARING BLUE
FLAME INTO THE BILGE

BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives
him the moment of distraction he needs He leaps out of the
bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken
power cable from the wall

BECK
Jones Get your feet out
of the water

Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck
thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creatures
feet

IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY

The current surges through the CobbDoc Creature sending it
instantly rigid A second later it crashes forward into the
water

Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs
out followed by Beck

THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE
LAST As they emerge Willie helps them

BECK
Cmon the Swamp

They start for the Swamp down Corridor A when an enormous
shudder goes through the Shack causing the lights to blink
and the floor to open beneath Beck The jolt knocks him
back into the bilge Only grabbing onto the pipes just
above the water stops him from falling back in

JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating

JONES
Beck

Jones moves instinctively back for him but another jolt
only widens the gap Beck yells to be heard over the din of
the collapsing Shack

BECK
Go on

JONES
No

BECK

Thats an order

JONES
Fuck your orders

He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts
his hand down into the darkness Beck lets go of one hand
then the other to grab Jones extended arm In one
Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge Together
they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit
collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor A
behind them They have to go around the other way

AS THEY RUN

LAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns Five
minutes until implosion

FLASH CUTS OF

THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING
TO GO ON AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING
THREE CREW MEMBERS

FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND
SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN RIVETS POP

STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE
CORRIDORS AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE
She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the
firm ground

JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP WITH WILLIE BEHIND
HIM AND BECK COVERING THE REAR

THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn
into the Swamp Annex Willie hits the door opener RRRRRR
IT DOESNT BUDGE The pressure has bent the door frame

BECK ARRIVES
WILLIE
Its jammed

Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand
held spreader--like a Jaws of Life--from the wall He
turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY
BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS
BECK AGAINST THE WIRE IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE

His head held in place by the powerful arm Beck looks
almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature Its
gill-like slits flare Its mouth opens and we see a flash
of its razor sharp teeth

Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the
steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a
knife for Becks face At the last instant Beck move his
head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh The mesh
loosens the creatures grip and Beck manages to reach a
mining drill from the tools on the wall As the appendage
starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the
Creatures tentacle and breaks free

Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where
Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door
open

JONES
Where the hellve you been

BECK
I got hung up Try this

Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the
tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made With Jones
help the two men force open the door and all three rush
inside the SWAMP Beck closes the door behind them

THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES Five minutes to
implosion And we feel it happening

THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE
VIBRATIONS

THE WALLS SHAKE

THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE
ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER

JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red
handled emergency air switch but he can only move it half
way It is jammed by the pressure
JONES
It wont go

Willie grabs it with him but even together it is not
enough THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS

STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE

THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION
THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES Four minutes
BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK

He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her
suit hangs

BECK
The suits Get in them

Willie moves quickly but Jones doesnt

JONES
The suits Are you crazy
Howre we going to get to
the surface

Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF
COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS

BECK
Like this

He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they
begin pulling the equipment out

BECK (contd)
Get them in the Lock

Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like
Container transporters to the lock

ON WILLIE She climbs into her suit and activates her
generator Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around
the perimeter of her helmet

THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONSThree
minutestoimplosion

Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the
elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to
arm himself with earlier He takes the tool from Beck and
sticks it in the vest of his wet suit

Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the
Lock Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track
to the Lock

JONES
Your suit Becky

BECK
Just get in yours

Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his
suit

Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving
along the track toward the Lock A suit turns the corner
from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK

Beck looks at the walls theyre shaking harder He moves

along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM

BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION A HUGE
TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR

BECK ducks just in time grabbing a fire ax and chopping off
the appendage Another tentacle jabs for Beck

WILLIE
(screams)
Look out

But it is too late It knocks the ax from Becks hand and
sends him to the floor Beck looks up at the Lock in time to
see Jones seal himself into his suit

JONESRADIO
Im in

BECK

(to the others)
Go

WILLIERADIO
No

THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK
Beck looks at the others one last time

BECK
Go now Thats an order
Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the
elevator sends them down without Beck

BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill which he
swings at the Creature driving it back As Beck gets the
upper hand the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck
freezes There attached to the back of the Creatures head
is the grotesque face of DeJesus

DeJesus eyes suddenly blink Hes still alive His lips
tremble in agony

DEJESUS
Kill meKill me

Beck momentarily stopped by the face lunges forward with
the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature

As the Creature falls back hurt Beck looks up at the lock
elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it
out His suit continues down the track and stops in the
Lock He still has to make it if he can just get there

THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS One minute to
implosion

Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit
His arms slide into place his legs drop into the heavy

metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the
generator

BECKS POV His vital signs light up around the perimeter
of his helmet but he sees something else--the Creature
charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck
out of the elevator Instinctively Beck swings his
motorized leg into the Creatures snarling mouth knocking
it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the
elevator button BUT IT DOESNT WORK

BECK
No

He hits again still nothing

THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICENineteen eighteen Her
voice begins to quiver

BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE
DIVES FOR HIM ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND
BECKS LEG
CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON Beck pounds it one last time
and NNNNNNNNNNNN

THE LOCK CLOSES CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK
OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH
IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY

UNDERWATER - LATER

WHOOSH A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward
the surface A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us
Its helmet light pierces the darkness then disappears A
moment later another Transporter follows racing out of the
darkness after the first

BECKS POV We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his
helmet The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as
he moves closer to the surface

WILLIES POV She tilts her head upwards She snaps off her
light and sees instead of black a lighter gray then
suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her At
first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her then
we see it again--a glimmer of light

WILLIE (RADIO)
Light Beck I see light

ON BECK
He follows her look Light is coming fast brightening as
they rise The LED numbers inside their helmets click
off125 100 75
BECK (RADIO)
Wait till you reach thirty-

five before you blow your suit

WILLIES VOICE (RADIO)

Roger
WILLIES POV Her numbers count down 70 60 50 40
WILLIE (RADIO)
Ejecting

She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH The
plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle Her
hand gropes for it

SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES
UPWARD
WHOOSH The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as
she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons

No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward Willie
frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface

SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE
SUN DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE
SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER

Then shes underwater again struggling desperately to pull
the tab on the life jacket around her neck Suddenly a MALE
HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS She looks up at Beck

WILLIE
We made it

BECK
Wheres Jones

Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell At
the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below face down Beck
breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach
Jones Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water
and inflates his life jacket

WILLIE
Is he okay

Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket Fora
moment Jones seems lifeless then his eyes blink and squint
against the sunlight Beck turns back to Willie and as he
and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the thumbs-up

WILLIE (contd)

(jubilant)
The sun The sun

Jones looks at Beck and grins

JONES
What happened to that typhoon

CALM SEA - LATER

BECK WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search
the horizon

WILLIE
Are you sure you saw something
JONES
How many times I got to tell
you I saw a ship

WILLIE
Well why havent they answered
our flares

BECK
Well fire one more that
leaves us one last one

BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it
into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark
water The light fades Willie looks at Jones

WILLIE
Are you okay Jonesy

JONES
(weakly)
Tip top Willietip top

WILLIE

(testing him)
Whos the best power forward
in the NBAJameson

JONES

(tired but

with fight)
Jameson Who are you trying
to con

They both manage a weak laugh then Beck sees something

BECK
Ill be damned LookA flare

As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just
fading against the sky

WILLIE
It saw us

JONES
Answer them and quit kicking me

WILLIE
Im not touching you

WHOOOOOOOOSH Beck fires another flare into the sky As the
flare arcs downward Willie feels another bump and for the
first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM

WILLIE
Nono no no

The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades
EXT US COASTGUARD SHIPS BRIDGE - SAME

A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
speaks to someone OS

CAPTAIN
I thought you said youd
combed this area

He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN
standing on the bridge He also lowers his binoculars and
smiles coolly as he lies

MARTIN
We didMany times

CAPTAIN

(looks at Martin

then to a Lieutenant)
Initiate rescue

We hold on Martins face as from
THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP

A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
off toward the fading flare

OCEAN - SAME

Jones Willie and Beck stay bunched close together
Suddenly Willie feels another bump

WILLIE
(panicky)
It hit me Where are they

BECK
I cant see them

Suddenly he is bumped by a shark Willie sees one only two
feet away They are surrounded Suddenly Jones stare to
taunt the sharks aggressively
JONES
All right Ive had enough
of this shit You want meat
motherfucker Come on eat
me sucker try some dark meat

He pushes away from the group despite Becks attempt to stop
him

JONES (cont d)

(taunting sharks)
Whats wrong you snout-nosed
bastards My meat too tough
for you

Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear Willie and Beck
watch stunned Even Jones is surprised

JONES (cont d)

(to Willie and Beck)
Whoa Did you see those fools
run They know whose boss

He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE
SEE a gash across his forearm

UNDERWATER POV

As Jones crows triumphantly WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS

SURFACE OCEAN

Jones is chortling suddenly his smile vanishes something
is happening

WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER THUMP
THUMP THUMPThe blades of the helicopter sound out over
the waves Its lights are visible Willie and Beck wave
frantically as Jones drifts closer to them

UNDERWATER

JONES LEGS His wet suit is now completely split open and
WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING

THE HELICOPTER

hovers over the group below and lands on the water Its
blades beat the surface into waves The WINCH OPERATOR
hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the
ring He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock
eyes Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and
signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety
Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm

BECK
JonesyGive me your hand

WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
harness The Winch operator throws it back across the water
where

BECK grabs the harness

BECK
Cmon Jones

Jones reaches out his hand He is almost there WHEN
SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE
SIXPACKBOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY HUGE AND
GRUESOME ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT IT GOES FOR
BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM

BECK
Jonesy No

JONES
Get out of here Becky

The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under
Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears Numbed he
clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly WE SEE a
boiling of water where Jones disappearedbubbles
risingand then Jones bloody and tattered life vest bobs
to the surface several feet away from Beck

Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again
It turns and focuses on Beck Beck keeps going for the life
vest as the Creature starts for him

ON HELICOPTER

The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the
Creature bears down on Beck

WINCH OPERATOR
Is he in the harness

CLOSE ON JONES TATTERED VEST Beck reaches it His fingers
wrap around the bicycle pump-like seismic tool in Jones

vest pocket The Creature is right on top of him

CHUNK CHUNK Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Becks body
in a death grip Its horrible mouth starts to open

BECK
Cmon motherfucker open up

The Creatures mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck

thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly
pulled from behind--out of the creatures grasp The rescue
cable is taut The helicopter is taking off

BECKS POV RISING SHOT Beck rises suddenly out of the
water the Creature growing instantly smaller below him
until BOOM the Seismic device explodes in the
SixpackBowman Creature blowing it to bits across the ocean
surface The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it
The winch operator pulls him in

EXT COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER

Beck dressed now in crisp white clothes stands on deck of
the ship He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
INFIRMARY then looks up as the Captain approaches and
shakes his hand

CAPTAIN
Mr Beck I understand
you passed your physical with
flying colors And Ms Williams

BECK

(worried)
I dont know yet shes still
in there

CAPTAIN

Well youll be glad to know
you have a friend onboard

Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them

MARTIN
(excitedly)
Beck I told them youd
make it No one back at
TransOcean believed me but
I never gave up on you once
(smiling)
So how are you feeling

Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in
one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across
the deck

BECK
BetterA lot better

Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears
with a new outfit on Smiles at Beck

WILLIE
Im fine

Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD
approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH HIDEOUS LOOKING
THINGS LIKE ANGLERS LOBSTERS CRABSMINIATURE LEVIATHAN
The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie The
Captain notices

CAPTAIN
I thought we might have some
wonderful seafood But if theres
something else youd rather have

Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
the Captain and smiles

WILLIE
How about a burger and fries

She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
deck with the Captain

AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
distance and WE ARE AT THE

SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
riding the swells rising and falling before slipping

beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
depths

THE END
