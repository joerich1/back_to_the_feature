life I want to get out there do more interesting
stuff live a little but I’d love to be able to do
it with you but I want you to want to want to do it

a pork scratching and regards SHAUN with a mixture of
exasperation and affection

I’m beginning to sound like your Mum Not that I’d
know what she sounds like

television which plays RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING His eyes are
closed SHAUN approaches him mind racing He raises the
CRICKET BAT above his head as organ music on the TV swells

SHAUN

You didn’t call the doctor did you

BARBARA
I just thought it was best to be safe

PHILIP
I’m quite alright Barbara I’ve run it under a cold
tap And we had our jabs when we went to the Isle of

BARBARA
But Philip-

PHILIP

Mum how much do you love Philip

BARBARA

Oh for goodness sake Shaun must we go through this

BARBARA
No you don’t understand Philip is my husband and has
been for seventeen years I know you haven’t always
seen eye to eye but I would at least expect you to
respect my feelings You have to be more adult about
these things

PHILIP (0S)
Yes come on Shaun

PHILIP is stood at the kitchen door his arm in a sling He
looks weak but still towers over SHAUN

PHILIP (CONT’D)
there comes a time when you’ve just got to be a
map

SHAUN glances down at the knife in his hand then back
at PHILIP His grip around the handle tightens

EXT BARBARA and PHILIP’S HOUSE -MOMENTS LATER

SHAUN drags his cricket bat like a stroppy teenager as he
leads BARBARA and PHILIP up the path There are still no
ZOMBIES around

PHILIP

ED stands at the end of the garden hands in his pockets

BARBARA
Hello Edward My you’ve grown

ED

LIZ whacks the PYJAMA ZOMBIE breaking the chair over its
head SHAUN gets to his feet and turns to see DAVID standing
around and ED texting someone SHAUN can’t believe it

DIANNE

DIANNE pulls a SWINGBALL out of the ground and throws it to
SHAUN He looks at it unsure what to do LIZ demonstrates a
stabbing move SHAUN flips up the sharp end of the SWINGBALL
pole and drives it through the PYJAMA ZOMBIE’s chest pinning
him to a tree Breathless he spins round to DAVID and ED

SHAUN
Feel free to step in anytime

ED
You seem to be doing alright

DAVID
I didn’t want to cramp your style

Incredulous SHAUN shakes his head He walks
over to a child’s slide by the fence

between them and the pub The GANG peer through the gaps

DAVID

DIANNE

SHAUN stands a little way off looking despondent

DAVID

sleeve

All turn to the PYJAMA ZOMBIE It’s ‘alive’ but stuck on the
SWINGBALL pole the ball too big for the hole made by the
shaft It MOANS frustrated DIANNE has an idea

EXT FINAL GARDEN -MOMENTS LATER
The GANG stand studying the captive PYJAMA ZOMBIE

DIANNE
Right shake out Get nice and limber Have another
look at the way he moves Remember it’s very limp
Almost like sleepwalking And look at the face
vacant with a hint of sadness Like a drunk who’s
lost a bet And the voice it’s a glottal rumble
with a neutral ‘A’ Okay everyone let’s have a look
shall we

They all do their zombie impressions LIZ gives good moan

DIANNE (CONT’D)
Nice good vocal work Liz

BARBARA is glazed over

DIANNE (CONT’D)

SHAUN makes a big decision He runs over to a picnic table-

SHAUN

EVERY SINGLE ZOMBIE turns their attention to SHAUN

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Wait ‘til I’ve gone then get inside

LIZ ED
Gone where Gone where

SHAUN (CONT’D)
(looks directly at Ed)
I won’t be long
(to LIZ)
Promise

SHAUN looks at ED who looks back concerned A moment of
silent understanding SHAUN jumps down right into the thick
of the approaching hordes and sprints off yelling and waving
his arms drawing all the ZOMBIES away He disappears out of
sight The GANG are all shocked by this particularly ED

DAVID
Shall we go in then

As the GANG move toward the pub BARBARA picks up the bunch
of flowers from the strewn rubbish and looks at the card

LIZ
Come on Barbara Leave them

BARBARA
But they’re for me

As LIZ helps BARBARA through the window a single ZOMBIE the
DEAD IRISH SPINSTER turns to see them disappear inside

INT THE WINCHESTER —LATER

CAMERA PANS 360 round the pub lounge It’s deserted lit only
by fading shafts of daylight The curtains have been drawn
over the broken window and billow ominously We find LIZ and
DIANNE sitting silently with BARBARA staring at the opening
ED stands forlornly by the fruit machine DAVID paces

BARBARA
Will Shaun be gone long

LIZ
No Barbara

DAVID
It’s a good twenty minutes since he went

ED
Seventeen

DAVID
Either way we should think about blocking up the
window We’re totally exposed

DIANNE
will Shaun get back in

DAVID
I’m sure he’11 knock

Nobody moves We can hear DISTANT MOANS outside

DAVID (CONT’D)
Oh for goodness sakes let’s at least get some lights
on

DAVID strides over to some light switches LIZ leaps up

LIZ
David wait-

DAVID goes ahead and flips the switches Nothing happens

DAVID
Power’s off

LIZ
That’s a good thing We don’t want to advertise our
whereabouts more than we already have

DAVID
No of course not-

LIZ
Do we David

DAVID
No of course not Lizzy I’m just trying to be pro-
active We have to face some facts here the power
and phones are off there’s no sign of the owners and
there’s a bloody great hole in the window

ED
You did that you twat

DAVID
Someone had to make a decision I don’t know if you
noticed but we were in a spot of bother back there
Somebody needs to take control of this situation
and if no-one else is prepared to take on that
responsibility then perhaps I should

Nobody speaks Again we hear the DISTANT MOANS

SHAUN casually leans back against the bar

DAVID

DAVID eyes SHAUN’s bloodstained shirt suspiciously

DAVID

SHAUN

BARBARA is standing upright behind DAVID Everyone stops at
the sound of her mournful whine Her eyes are a milky white
skin a lifeless grey face twisted almost pleading SHAUN
takes the rifle from DAVID and points it at her His hands
shake his eyes fill with tears His finger tenses

DAVID

ZOMBIE BARBARA hisses and LUNGES FORWARD

BARBARA looks at DAVID her expression twists intg a scowl
ts

SHAUN

DAVID is flecked with blood ZOMBIE BARBARA drops

TOTAL SHOCK SHAUN lets the rifle fall to the floor Everyone
is speechless DAVID takes off his glasses to clean them

DAVID

the face sending him sprawling DAVID rolls over he now has
the rifle in his hands HE POINTS IT AT SHAUN

CLICKthe rifle is empty DAVID looks desperate and
ashamed Everyone else is appalled SHAUN hasn’t flinched

DAVID
Right I’m leaving

LIZ

DAVID walks to the BOLTED FRONT DOOR and starts to move the
tables and chairs away The NOISE outside RISES

LIZ
If you open that door we won’t stand
a chance

DAVID begins UNLOCKING THE DEADBOLTS to the front door

LIZ
David don’t It’s suicide

ED

We can defend ourselves

DIANNE

silly thing to do

DAVID
So you’re staying here With him

DIANNE
Shaun didn’ t-

DAVID

Ah-ah Shaun didn’t ask you-

Shaun didn’t ask you to come here You came for the
same reason I did You didn’t know what else to do
Now get away from that door this instant

DAVID

DAVID crumples the pool cue dropping from his hand He steps
away from the door and slumps against the window in tears

DAVID
I’m sorry Dianne I’m sorry Lizzy

DIANNE
Maybe we’re not the ones you should be apologising
ito

DAVID turns to SHAUN his face quivering with guilt

DAVID
I’m sorry Shaun

SHAUN nods Silently accepting the apology

DIANNE
Well done Daffs That took guts-—

SMASH DEAD HANDS BREAK THROUGH THE WINDOW DAVID is pulled
back as ZOMBIES BITE DOWN ON HIS BODY He screams in pain

SHAUN LIZ and DI try desperately to pull DAVID back as he
is dragged outside and TORN TO PIECES

They attempt to keep hold but fall backwards to find
themselves clutching David’s SEVERED LOWER LEG The screaming
remainder of DAVID is being sucked into the hungry crowd

DIANNE (CONT’D)
DAVID NO

Still holding David’s leg DIANNE gets up and runs straight
to the front door UNLOCKING THE FINAL DEADBOLT

SHAUN LIZ

Too late DIANNE opens the door and runs out to
save David thrashing at the ZOMBIES with her
boyfriend’s leg

A FLAMING COCKTAIL sails over LIZ and SHAUN’s head and
explodes over the door It ignites the surrounding curtains
and carpet ZOMBIES fall back momentarily

SHAUN
Keep ‘em coming

The front barricade FALLS ZOMBIES dropping clumsily into the
room Another COCKTAIL EXPLODES holding them back

The BACK DOOR shifts The barricade of tables and chairs
fall DEAD HANDS reach into the bar grabbing ED’s neck

ED

SHAUN spins and throws the rifle to ED who catches it and
blasts over his shoulder The HANDS fall back releasing him

Behind a PIZZA DELIVERY ZOMBIE walks through the fire

LIZ
Ed Over here

ED chucks the rifle to LIZ She is unsure what to do the
PIZZA ZOMBIE’s head is protected by a helmet Deftly she
smashes the visor with the gun butt and fires into the hole

Smooth

SHAUN notices BARBARA’s body He grabs his jacket and lays it
over her face placing the flowers on top

To me

LIZ chucks him the rifle ZOMBIE PETE lunges at ED hissing

ZOMBIE PETE

ED

ED gets PETE in a headlock But he is distracted by a
HALLOWEEN RINGTONE trilling out from somewhere in the bar ED
looks up to see a COMMUTER ZOMBIE holding his phone

ED (CONT’D)
Hey that’s mine you cheeky-

ED screams as PETE BITES DOWN INTO HIS ARM ED throws his
head back in pain making his neck available to the nearby
ZOMBIE BERNIE who takes a MASSIVE CHUNK out of it

SHAUN
Noooooo000000

SHAUN takes aim at ED’s attackers but can’t get
a clear shot

wy

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Pete

Amazingly PETE hears this and turns around to face SHAUN
PETE’s dead eyes lock with SHAUN’s

SHAUN (CONT’D)
I said leave him alone

SHAUN blows PETE’s head clean off He swings back to ED but
can no longer see him There are too many ZOMBIES between

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Ed

The front of the pub is now wide open LIZ fends off the
increasing numbers with a HAT STAND They’re everywhere

LIZ
Shaun Bar

SHAUN
But-

LIZ bundles SHAUN behind the bar They crouch down kicking
the back door shut and holding it with their feet

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Ed

No answer

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Ed

SHAUN peers back He sees nothing but ZOMBIES

SHAUN (CONT’D)
ED

A HUGE SHAPE tumbles over the bar next to SHAUN and LIZ

ED
What

ED is alive but badly bitten his neck GUSHING BLOOD

SHAUN
I thought you were-

ED
Yeah yeah Chuck us a cloth will you

SHAUN does so ED presses the beer cloth to his neck ZOMBIES
now fill the bar having breached the first fire barricade

ED (CONT’D)
Get the brandy

SHAUN grabs a bottle of brandy and offers it to ED

ED (CONT’D)
Not for me you tit Smash it on the bar

SHAUN jumps up and smashes the bottle He grabs his lighter
and ignites the spirit Flames rip along the bar a new fire
wall erupts SHAUN rejoins ED and LIZ triumphant

LIZ
Where are the bullets

ED
Call them shells

LIZ

SHAUN jumps up again to retrieve the shells from the bar He
burns his fingers and crouches down again sucking his thumb

SHAUN
Oh fuck it Owww Fuck it

ZOMBIES now reach through the flames pushing at the pumps
Alcohol rains down ED takes a few gulps

SHAUN (CONT’D)
So what are we going to do then Where are we going

to go

SHAUN and LIZ look round at a loss Then-

BANG A FOOTBALL hits the back of the bar smashing a mirror

It falls down and settles on the TRAPDOOR to the cellar

ED
The cellar

LIZ
Maybe we can get out

ED
Yeah there’s the barrel hatch That leads out into
the street

SHAUN
You mean go back outside

LIZ
Which would you prefer mortal peril or certain
death

SHAUN
Umfirst one

They head for the TRAPDOOR But-
The ZOMBIE IRISH SPINSTER drops over and gets to her feet

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Oh give us a fucking break

On the fiery bar the BOX OF SHELLS suddenly explodes Stray
bullets fire off everywhere One ricochets off the pub bell
and hits the ZOMBIE IRISH SPINSTER in the head She falls
disappointed SHAUN LIZ and ED make for the hatch

INT CELLAR —CONTINUOUS

They pull ED down into a dark cellar filled with boxes and
laundry SHAUN grabs some piping from the floor and shoves it
through the handle of the trapdoor wedging it shut

ED slumps against the wall the beer cloth already sodden
with blood LIZ grabs some linen from the washing line and
uses it to bandage ED’s wounds

In the far corner of the cellar a shaft of orange street
light illuminates the outline of the BARREL HATCH

SHAUN
I can see the street

He puts the rifle down and jumps up hanging from the
handles The BARREL HATCH does not budge

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Come on

SHAUN pulls frantically before dropping down He tries again
desperately trying to force open the hatch

SHAUN (CONT’D)
COME ON

LIZ watches with an increasing air of disappointment

LIZ
Shaun

SHAUN
WHY WON’T IT OPEN

SHAUN drops down again and slides down the wall utterly
defeated He laughs grimly

SHAUN (CONT’D)
So that’s that then We’re trapped ‘Let’s go to the
Winchester’ Who the fuck came up with that idea
(puts head in hands)
Oh man I’ve really ballsed this up

LIZ leaves ED and sits with SHAUN on the floor The noise
from upstairs is muffled the cellar oddly quiet

LIZ
No you haven’t

y j

i

SHAUN
I have Liz I’m useless I couldn’t save us I
couldn’t save Di and David I couldn’t even save my
own mother I should have been there I can’t-

LIZ
You shouldn’t feel so responsible You tried You did
something That’s what counts God knows where we’d
be if you hadn’t

SHAUN
I s’pose

The CELLAR DOOR SHAKES violently LIZ and SHAUN look at it

LIZ
Do you think they’1l get through

SHAUN

LIZ
How many shells have we got left

SHAUN
Two I guess we could take out a few of them If they

stand in a line

LIZ
I wasn’t thinking about them

SHAUN
I know

SHAUN looks around at the surrounding bottles and barrels

SHAUN (CONT’D)
Can’t we just drink ourselves to death
J

LIZ
I don’t think we’ve got time

The CELLAR DOOR SHUDDERS again SHAUN looks at the rifle

SHAUN
There’s only two shells What about

we ED (0S)
I don’t mind being eaten

SHAUN
How are we gonna do this

LIZ
I don’t know I suppose one of us has to go first

SHAUN
Maybe one of us has to ‘do’ the other and then ‘do’
themselves

LIZ
Maybe you should ‘do’ me first I’11 only muck it up
if I have to ‘do’ myself

SHAUN briefly mimes this out then shakes his head
SHAUN
I really don’t know if I’ve got it in me to shoot my
mum my flat-mate and my girlfriend all in the same

evening

LIZ
What makes you think I’ve taken you back

The CELLAR DOOR buckles The COPPER PIPE BENDS

SHAUN
Well you don’t want to die single do you

They laugh and look deeply into each other’s eyes

ED (0S)
Actually I would like to be shot

SHAUN
Besides I’ve changed y’know I haven’t had a fag

since yesterday I promise

ED
He hasn’t

LIZ
Maybe we should have one now

LIZ takes out a crumpled packet of cigarettes SHAUN looks
shocked LIZ smiles innocently

LIZ (CONT’D)
You left them in my room

SHAUN
They were in the bin

LIZ
I was desperate

SHAUN
Sneaky cow

They each take a cigarette LIZ shrugs

LIZ
I’m sorry

SHAUN
Aah I won’t say anything

SHAUN ignites his lighter The flame illuminates A RED BUTTON
on the wall above which is a sign reading

‘WAY OUT’

SHAUN holds the lighter up to reveal an electric door
mechanism They were sitting on the SERVICE LIFT all along

He and LIZ exchange a look They nod A silent agreement

CRACK The CELLAR DOOR splinters DEAD FINGERS claw through
as the smoke thickens They are almost inside

SHAUN runs to ED’s side He is pale and visibly fading

SHAUN
Come on We’re leaving

ED
I might just stay here

SHAUN
But we can all get out

ED
I think you two should make a go of it

SHAUN
What are you talking about

ED
I’11 only hold you back

SHAUN looks at his friend and realises he’s right With a
somber nod he offers ED the RIFLE

ED (CONT’D)
Don’t you want it

SHAUN
Nah You have it I can’t hit anything with it
anyway

ED takes the RIFLE from SHAUN

SHAUN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry Ed

ED

SHAUN
I’m sorry I shouted at you earlier

ED
S’alright I’m sorry too

SHAUN
It’s okay

No I’m sorry Shaun Ready

woe puzzles before his expression turns to disgust ED

laughs SHAUN winces as he covers his nose and mouth Ready

SHAUN They both raise their weapons ready to fight on together
Oh Jesus That’s not funny The CHORUS OF MOANS is now deafening But then-

ED Another sound An ENGINE ROARING approaching fast
I’1l1 stop doing them when you stop laughing
SHAUN and LIZ are dazzled by BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS as one of
SHAUN a CONVOY OF MILITARY TRUCKS mounts the curb next to the
(welling up) Winchester knocking several ZOMBIES flying
I’m not laughing

FIGURES leap from the back ORDERS barked SHOTS are fired
The CELLAR DOOR finally gives Smoke now pours through SHAUN and LIZ are disoriented until they hear

ED VOICE (0S)
