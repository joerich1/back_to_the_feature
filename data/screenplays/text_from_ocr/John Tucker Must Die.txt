John Tucker Must Die

Jeff Lowell

17 June 2004
INT HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

The gym is filled to the rafters with screaming students
cheering on their basketball team One particularly good
looking player who we’ll learn later is JOHN TUCKER fakes
one way spins in the other direction and dunks The gym
goes nuts We push in on a girl KATE sitting in the
stands She’s high up and she’s there alone - she has a book
in her hand which she reads during time outs She’s pretty
but not made up too much and she’s dressed comfortably so
as not to draw too much attention to herself

KATE (VO)
I was in seventh grade when I realized I
was invisible

INT GRADE SCHOOL

A teacher arranges a group of seventh grade girls in line by
height Kate is towards the middle

KATE (VO)
Not really invisible - although how
awesome would that have been No it’s
just that I didn’t make an impression of
any kind If I disappeared it wouldn’t
even cause a ripple

A teacher shifts a young Kate one space over now exactly the
middle

KATE (VO) (CONTD)
I wasn’t the tallest or the shortest I
wasn’t the smartest or the dumbest I
wasn’t the richest or the poorest I was
just what’s-her-name you know the
brunette Kate I think

INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

A spelling bee is in progress as a young Kate takes her turn
at the podium She’s one of seven people left

YOUNG KATE
A-N-O-N-I-M-O-U-S Anonymous

MODERATOR (0S)
I’m sorry that’s wrong

Kate walks away

KATE (VO)
It’s not that I didn’t try - I was a pretty
good speller and a pretty good singer and
a pretty good runner-
EXT TRACK —- DAY
A group of girls run past the finish line

ANNOUNCER (VO)
And in fourth place just out of the
medals Kate Spencer

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The auditorium is decorated for a dance and is filled with
freshman boys and girls Freshman Kate sits against the
wall trying to look like a great person to dance with

KATE (VO)
Even in love well I usually ended up
out of medal contention there too

A good looking boy walks over and takes in Kate and the other
wallflowers He looks to Kate’s left - at a rather
unfortunate looking girl He shudders looks at Kate Not
bad He smiles starts over when a hot girl to Kate’s right
suddenly pops into view - she’d been picking a button off the
floor

HOT GIRL
Found it

She and the boy lock eyes - the boy veers off from Kate and
holds out his hand to the hot girl They twirl off like Fred
and Ginger

INT GIRL’S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Kate stands at a locker by herself getting dressed as other
groups of girls around her talk

KATE (VO)

It didn’t help that my mom and I were
always moving You can put up with just
about anything when you’ve got a bunch of
great friends to help you through but
well let’s just say “openness to
outsiders” isn’t really what teens are
famous for

One of the girls near Kate turns to her friends
GIRL IN LOCKER ROOM
I don’t have anything for my hair Do you

have a barrette or something

Kate surreptitiously pulls the elastic band out of her hair
turns to the girl

( )

KATE
Hey I’ve got one

GIRL IN LOCKER ROOM
Do I know you

KATE
Not really

GIRL IN LOCKER ROOM
Pass

The girls head out The locker room is empty now Kate’s
alone She sighs puts her hair back together

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

We’re in the living room of a house on moving day - boxes and
furniture scattered everywhere A sweaty Kate staggers
through with a box

KATE (VO)
There was one last thing working against
me

There’s a knock at the door She turns and drops the box
when she sees who it is - it’s an older boy a knockout He
holds out a plate wrapped with aluminum foil

JUSTIN
(too cool)
Hey I’m Justin I live next door and my
mom sent me over with these brownies or
something

Kate takes the plate while she tries to push her hair into
some arrangement that’s not too disgusting

KATE
(flustered)
Hi I’m Kate I just moved in Duh

JUSTIN
So Kate you-

Something catches Justin’s eye

JUSTIN (CONTD)
Holy

Kate turns to see what he’s looking at - a gorgeous woman in
her early thirties just walked into the room She’s been
working too but instead of sweating she’s glistening like
a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model on a beach in Fiji

( )

She’s dressed in shorts and a t-shirt that may have fit her
in grade school

KATE (VO)
That other thing working against me

KATE (CONTD)
This is my Mom

LORI
Lori Hi

Justin takes the plate out of Kate’s hand and holds it out to
Lori

JUSTIN
I made these for you
(then)
I can pick up heavy things

INT BEDROOM - DAY
Kate sits at her desk taking notes as she reads a textbook

KATE (VO)
It’s not like she can help it She’s just
incredibly beautiful and skimpily dressed
Okay maybe she can help that part

Kate looks up from her book

KATE (CONTD)
Did you get this on page fifty-one Andy

We see that Kate is studying with a boy but he’s looking out
the window Down by the pool Kate’s mother is tanning face
down with her top on the pool deck beside her

ANDY
Turn over turn over turn over turn over
turn over turn over

KATE (VO)
It’s not like being beautiful has made her
life any easier I mean she’s never had
trouble landing great looking men she’s
just had trouble keeping them In the last
seventeen years she’s been through four
marriages and I don’t know how many
boyfriends That’s why we’re always
moving

MONTAGE
A quick series of shots of different great looking men

staring into the camera

INT HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

We’re back at the game we started at with Kate in the
stands

KATE (VO)
But enough about me The real story here
is John Tucker

ON COURT

John our star basketball player has the ball again He
passes it - no he’s kept in the palm of his hand he drives
and dumps off to a teammate who’s free under the basket for a
lay up More cheers high fives all around John’s a stud
tall buff best head of hair on campus

KATE (CONTD)
That’s John Tucker Captain of the
basketball team family’s loaded always
voted most likely to everything lost his
virginity at 14 To the french teacher

( )

IN THE CROWD

A pretty woman in her twenties wearing a French flag
sweatshirt and waving a team flag cheers John on

ON COURT
John hassles the passer then jogs backwards on defense

KATE (VO) (CONTD)
He’s the guy this school revolves around
At least he used to be until You know
what I’m getting ahead of myself It all
started when my mom got divorced again and
we moved to this town to “start over” I
got a job as a waitress at what turned out
to be John’s favorite restaurant I wasn’t
the best waitress ever but I wasn’t the
worst

INT ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Kate comes out of the kitchen and crosses over to find John
Tucker (in suit and tie) sitting at a table with CARRIE
editor of the school paper Carrie’s a super-smart
overachiever with roughly a thousand commitments taking up
her time She’s also (like everyone with John) very pretty

KATE
Are you ready

JOHN
(to Carrie)
I’m not sure Are you ready

CARRIE
Do you recommend anything

JOHN
Me What do you recommend You’re the one
who speaks Italian

CARRIE
I don’t speak it I know a little

JOHN

That you picked up travelling around
Europe You’re so lucky I can only
imagine walking around the same streets
where all those artists and poets walked
looking at the same sights Shakespeare
looked at when he wrote

(gazing into Carrie’s eyes)
“Her beauty makes this vault a feasting
presence full of light”

(MORE ) ( )

JOHN (CONTD)
(then)
Maybe I don’t need to go to Europe after
all

Carrie blushes gives a flustered laugh John turns to Kate

JOHN (CONTD)
I guess we need a minute Thanks

Kate walks off - it’s clear she’s more than a little
impressed by John’s display

INT ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

It’s a different night at Kate’s restaurant Kate comes out
of the kitchen loaded down with plates She hears a
snapping glances towards the source then does a double
take John Tucker (in a letterman’s jacket) is there with a
different girl HEATHER who couldn’t look more like a
cheerleader because she is a cheerleader She’s been popular
and beautiful for so long that she’s grown to believe that
her superiority is the natural order of things John keeps
snapping at Kate without looking finally Kate gets the
plates down and heads over to John’s table

KATE
Hi Would you-

JOHN
Were ready to order

KATE
Uh okay
(to Heather)
What would you like

JOHN
Ill order for her

Heather puts down her menu gets a huge smile on her face

HEATHER
I love that

JOHN
(all charm)
I love taking care of you
(to Kate all business)
Two spinach salads chicken piccata for
her filet for me medium And don’t rush
us between courses Got it

KATE
Uh yeah Can I-

But John’s done with her and has turned back to Heather
( )

JOHN
That sweater is so hot on you I bet it’s
even hotter off you

Heather laughs Kate walks away shaking her head - what
happened to the John that was here the other night

INT ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Yet another night John Tucker (in slacker-wear) sits at a
table with BETH She’s a hippie throwback a young Drew
Barrymore type She and John are looking at their menus

JOHN
I’ve never been here I hope they have good
vegetarian
(off the menu)
Oh my Goddess

BETH
What

JOHN
Veal Let’s go

BETH
Don’t worry I’m sure I can find something

ANGLE ON Kate standing over at a waitstation with another
waitress She’s gestures at John

KATE
What’s the deal with-

WAITRESS
John Tucker Total operator Brings all
his women here

KATE
How does he get away with dating so many
women

WAITRESS

(bitter laugh)
He says his father doesn’t want him dating
during the basketball season so he “keeps
his focus” Total lie It’s just another
one of his scams so they have to keep the
“relationship” secret

KATE
Unbelievable How’d you learn all this

The waitress starts to cry and runs back into the kitchen
INT GYM - DAY

Kate is in gym class with the other girls including John’s
three current girlfriends (Heather Carrie and Beth)

They’re picking teams for volleyball - about half the girls
are still waiting to be picked including Kate Heather (the
cheerleader) is one of the girls picking She points at
Kate

HEATHER
Uh I’11 take her

KATE
(too eager)
Kate Hi I didn’t catch your name

Heather looks at Kate like she’s nuts

HEATHER
Okay moving on

INT GYM - LATER
The game’s in progress A point is scored and while a girl

runs after the ball to retrieve it Carrie (the editor) is
gossiping with the girl standing next to her

GIRL
You weren’t at the party Where were you
CARRIE
I’m not suppose to say but
(quietly)

John Tucker

Behind Carrie Heather is getting ready to serve She
obviously heard this - her mouth drops wide open

GIRL
Get out

COACH WILLIAMS the gym teacher blows her whistle

COACH WILLIAMS
Less talking more playing Serve it

Heather tosses the ball in the air and serves it - right into
the back of Carrie’s head Carrie is knocked on her face

HEATHER
Sorry It slipped

The girls around Carrie (including Kate) pick her up

( )

CARRIE
I’m okay I’m okay Let’s just play

Every gets back in position and Heather serves again - right
into the back of Carrie’s head sending her down again

Carrie jumps up and runs over to Heather as the other girls
crowd around and the coach starts madly blowing her whistle

CARRIE (CONT’D)
That wasn’t an accident

Beth (the hippie) gets between Carrie and Heather who ignore
her as they keep arguing

HEATHER
You better stay away from him

BETH
Violence isn’t going to solve anything

CARRIE
What’s it to you

BETH
No man is worth us fighting over

HEATHER
Listen I don’t know what he told you but
John Tucker is dating me

Now Beth’s mouth drops - she turns and slugs Heather in the
jaw dropping her to the floor

HEATHER (CONTD)
(from the floor)
What the hell is your problem

BETH
I’m dating John Tucker

Coach Williams has finally made it over

COACH WILLIAMS
Enough

She grabs Carrie who grabs the coach’s clipboard and swings
it at Beth Beth moves and Kate gets hit instead It’s an
all out melee now with Kate accidentally caught in the
middle People are falling arms are swinging and finally
Kate snaps

KATE
Stop it This guy is cheating on all of
you and instead of being mad at him you’re
beating the crap out of each other
( )

Silence as the girls look at each other digesting the wisdom
of what Kate said Finally Beth turns to Heather

BETH
Whos that

HEATHER
I don’t know Pam maybe

INT GIRL’S BATHROOM —- DAY

Kate is at the mirror trying to cover up the bruise on her
cheek from where she got hit Carrie comes in

CARRIE
Hey

KATE
Hey

CARRIE

Sorry about your face Kate right

KATE
Yeah It only hurts when I smile Or
talk Or do this

She makes a face in the mirror winces Carrie laughs

CARRIE
What you said out there-

KATE
Sorry someone just sat on me and-

CARRIE
Yeah that was me But the thing is you
were right

KATE
I was

CARRIE
Look what he’s doing to us girls I don’t
even know you and I hit you in the head
with a clipboard

KATE
That was you too huh Anyway Ive seen a
million John Tuckers they all lie to get
what they want and the girls always put up
with it

( )

CARRIE
Youre totally right I never understood
it until now but you’re right

KATE
Well it helps that those are the only guys
my mom dates Pretty soon you figure out
they’re all the same

CARRIE
Come on I’ve got some planning to do and
then weve got to talk to Beth and Heather

KATE
We You want me to come

CARRIE
Sure in case we start fighting again I’ve
got to have someone to hide behind

KATE
What the heck I think my head can absorb
three or four more good shots before I have
brain damage
Carrie heads out of the bathroom Kate in tow
INT STARBUCKS - LATER

Kate Carrie Beth and Heather sit at a table Beth and
Heather don’t look too happy to be there

CARRIE
Be honest What are you going to do about
John
HEATHER
I’m totally breaking up with him
BETH
No you’re not
HEATHER
Like you are
BETH

It’s up to him If he dumps you two I’1l
take him back

CARRIE
We’re going to end up right back where we
started He’ll get back together with all
of us lie about it until he decides he’s
done with us and then dump us for good

( )

Beth and Heather stare at Carrie unconvinced Kate clears
her throat

KATE
I bet I know what you’re thinking “I’m
different I’m the one he’s going to stay
with forever”

Beth and Heather look at each other look down

BETH
Maybe

HEATHER
Why not I am the head cheerleader

BETH
You say that like it makes you some kind of
god and we’re all losers

HEATHER
No I mean a little but no I don’t
think that

CARRIE

Let’s stay focused here Everyone he’s
ever dated thinks they’re different It’s
what he does

BETH
So what are we supposed to do

CARRIE
Kate had an idea

KATE
I was just saying it’s always the women who
end up getting hurt

CARRIE
Exactly Why is he getting off the hook
We could all date anyone and for some
reason we let him walk all over us

HEATHER
It’s because he’s hot

BETH
Hot He’s the most gorgeous man I’ve ever
seen He’s like a Greek god sent to earth
to remind us mortals what beauty is

Beth notices everyone staring at her She snaps out of it

( )

BETH (CONT’D)
But you’re right That’s not enough

KATE
So why not teach him a lesson

HEATHER
How Break up with him He’1l have
someone else in a second

CARRIE
No bigger We’re going to make him
undateable make it so no one wants to go
out with him anymore

Carrie pulls out a huge sheath of color-coded papers and
folders hands a thick stack to each girl

CARRIE (CONTD)
I had some time to go over some possible
approaches I’11l bottom line it he
doesn’t know we’re on to him We can use
the fact that we’re his “girlfriends” to
set him up humiliate him and make him
look like a fool in front of the whole
school

HEATHER
(smiles imagining it)
That wouldn’t suck

CARRIE
And we won’t just be taking care of him
Well be sending a message to all the John
Tuckers that we’re not going to put up with
it anymore They’re going to have to treat
us with respect

BETH
They’re going to have to stop lying to us

HEATHER
And cheating on us

CARRIE
Exactly I’ve got a whole section on that
starting on page three

BETH
(paging through thick folder)
When do you sleep

CARRIE
I take ten minute naps five times a day
I’m like Thomas Edison

( )

HEATHER
(whispers to Beth)
Who

BETH
(whispers back)
He was a President

CARRIE
Come on what do you say

A beat then

BETH
Let’s get him

HEATHER
I’m in But if I find out this is some
kind of trick I’m back with him so fast

Carrie pulls out a small leather notebook writes in it
Yes this has some significance later

KATE
Wow this is great He doesn’t stand a
chance against you guys

BETH

You’re not going to help us
KATE

Me Why me
BETH

It was your idea

KATE
No I just pointed out that you all should
do something He didn’t do anything to me

CARRIE
Didn’t he He got all of us mad enough to
beat the crap out of you in gym

BETH
Besides can you honestly say that you
haven’t been screwed over by a John Tucker
somehow somewhere

HEATHER
Come on it’ll be fun What else are you
doing
Heather has a good point Kate shrugs

( )

KATE
Let’s get him

EXT STADIUM - DAY

Different groups are using the track the female track team
(including Kate) is running sprints and the cheerleaders
led by Heather are just finishing up practice as random
people jog by on the track One of them is John Tucker who
stops and waits for Heather to wander over and join him He
glances around to make sure no one is within earshot

JOHN
Heard there was a thing in gym yesterday
HEATHER
Some loser was saying she went out with
you
JOHN

You’re kidding That’s such a lie
HEATHER
Oh I totally know Don’t worry I mean
you can’t date-
JOHN
(sadly )
The basketball

HEATHER
But if you could I know who it’d be

JOHN
You know it babe

John looks around to makes sure no one’s watching slaps
Heather on the ass

ACROSS THE FIELD Kate is standing at a drinking fountain
watching

KATE
Euch

There’s a guy standing behind her at the fountain SCOTT

SCOTT
Is that for her or him

KATE
Him

( )

SCOTT
That’s not usually the noise girls make
when they look at him Usually it’s more
of a “ohhhhh”

KATE
(laughs)
Jerk isn’t really my type

SCOTT
I guess he is kind of a jerk isn’t he

KATE
I’m surprised to hear a guy say that I
thought he was your god

SCOTT
Close Older brother

KATE
Oh no Seriously

Scott holds out his hand

SCOTT
Scott Tucker

KATE
Kate I’m so embarrassed-

SCOTT
Don’t be If anything I’m embarrassed
about being his brother I think my mom
was experimenting with drugs or living on a
toxic waste dump when she had him

Kate laughs They’re interrupted by a bell
SCOTT (CONTD)

Damn I’ve got to run Don’t worry your

secret’s safe with me Kate
Scott winks and heads off
INT KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Heather and Carrie are sitting in Kate’s living room as Kate
opens the door and lets Beth in Carrie has a new Apple
Powerbook plugged into Kate’s television - on the screen is a
Keynote presentation complete with an unflattering picture
of John and a list of bullet points next to him Very slick

CARRIE

It wasn’t for me

Heather and Carrie exchange a look

HEATHER
Told you she couldn’t keep it together

BETH
Figures you two would gang up on me
Little Miss Popular and Little Miss
Perfect

CARRIE
Hey don’t lump me with her

HEATHER
What’s that supposed to mean

CARRIE
Just that we’re very different

HEATHER
Meaning you’re better than me

Kate laughs Everyone looks at her

KATE
Don’t you see This is exactly how he gets
away with it He knows you wouldn’t be
caught dead talking to each other and
that’s why he’s so safe cheating

( )

CARRIE
Kate’s right I’m sorry We’ve got to
stick together all right

The girls nod

CARRIE (CONTD)
Okay he’s back with all of us he doesn’t
know anything’s up let’s keep it that way
until we get him

HEATHER
Speaking of which does anyone have any
idea how we’re going to do this

There’s a pause Heather holds up one of Carrie’s folders

HEATHER (CONT’D)
I mean I read Carrie’s term paper-

CARRIE
No you didn’t

HEATHER
Okay but come on it’s like the phone
book I flipped through and didn’t see
anything um

BETH
Concrete Yeah You’ve got some great
ideas but what do we do

KATE
Well I mean I don’t know him like you all
do but I noticed something He makes
every woman he’s with feel special he
tells them exactly what they want to
hear what if we showed people that it’s
just an act Really show who he is so no
one ever trusts him again I mean when I
saw him I thought he was cute but after I
saw how he was with all of you

The girls take this in nodding

CARRIE
Excellent Good Throw those away

Carrie grabs all the folders
CARRIE (CONT’D)
Let’s get to work

( )

Beth goes to the computer reaches for a key

CARRIE (CONTD)
Not that Just press the- no not that
Move the cursor to- You know what I’11

CARRIE

Kate goes into the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Kate enters just as her mother comes in from outside
carrying a bag of groceries Lori’s dressed in her usual

young hip sexy way looking more like a teen than a mom

LORI
Hey what’s up

KATE
Oh nothing just-

Laughter from the next room

LORI
You have friends over

KATE
Yeah a few girls stopped by

Lori hugs Kate

( )

LORI

I can’t wait to meet them
Lori heads out of the kitchen

KATE
Actually we’re-

Too late Lori’s gone Kate grabs sodas and follows
INT KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kate enters the room right behind Lori

KATE
Beth Carrie Heather this is my mom

LORI
Lori

The girls all exchange looks - Lori doesn’t look like a mom

LORI (CONTD)
So what are you all up to

BETH
Destroying a man

LORI
Who do I make my check out to

The girls laugh Lori crosses over and sits on the floor
with the girls

LORI (CONTD)
So who is he and what did he do

Beth presses a key on her computer John zooms back onto the
screen along with ominous sound effect music and booing

BETH
This is John Tucker
LORI
Cute Let me guess heartbreaker
HEATHER
Big time
LORI

Youre lucky I got here I’ve got some
experience in this field

( )

Kate can’t take any more She pastes on a smile trying very
hard not to let her true feelings out

KATE
Mom I really don’t know if we should be
taking advice about men from you

LORI
Why not I’ve dated a hundred of them I
know all their tricks

KATE
And yet you still keep going falling for
them

CARRIE

What’s the matter She’s an expert

KATE
Okay then

Kate shrugs hands out the sodas takes a seat She’s not a
happy camper Carrie takes her place at her computer - her
talk is illustrated by an impressive presentation complete
with video graphics music etc

CARRIE
All right Kate’s right We need to show
people the real John Tucker And to do
that we need a public platform - something
where the whole school is there That much
I’ve already got figured out Ladies
and ladies I give you the school
election

HEATHER
(unimpressed)
The election

BETH
He’s not even running

CARRIE
Yes the election and he will run Beth
you’re going to convince him

BETH
How do I do that

CARRIE
How do girls get boys to do anything

INT HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

The hall is empty Suddenly the door to the boys bathroom
crashes open and Beth and John stumble into the hallway in
an embrace They break Beth tucks in her shirt John wipes
the lipstick off his face Beth pauses under a political
poster - a slick one with a photo of a smiling guy running
for school president

BETH
You know I’m surprised you never ran for
any kind of office

JOHN
It’s just something you do to get into
college and I’ve got the basketball

BETH
Yeah I guess you’re right Still it’s a
big popularity contest and there’s no way
he’s more popular than you

Beth heads back towards her class leaving John looking up at
the poster He doesn’t look happy

INT SCHOOL NEWSPAPER OFFICE —- DAY

Carrie sits at a computer in the middle of a chaotic pile of
photos old issues submissions There’s one other student
working there - he looks up as John enters Unseen to
Carrie John points at the door and the student takes off

JOHN
Hey Carrie What do you think about me
running for school president

CARRIE
I didn’t think you got into that

JOHN
I never did and all of a sudden I realized
I’m missing part of the high school
experience

CARRIE
It’s a little late to be getting involved-

JOHN
I’ve got to win You’ll help me You’re
the smartest girl I know you run the
newspaper-

CARRIE
(pretending to soften)
You want my help Well
( )

JOHN
I knew you’d do it I love you

CARRIE
What

John acts surprised like he didn’t mean to let that slip
out He clearly did

JOHN
I mean I love you for helping I can’t
believe I said that

CARRIE
No it’s okay

He holds her hand gazes into her eyes then

JOHN
So you’ll do it

INT DIVE RESTAURANT —- DAY

The four girls are sitting together at a table Heather
takes a bite of her burger grimaces

HEATHER
Since when do we eat here

CARRIE
Since we can’t be seen together If he
hears we’re friends he’ll know something’s
up Come on it’s not that bad

Carrie samples her food shudders gingerly returns the bite
to her napkin

CARRIE (CONTD)
Anyone have a napkin they’re not using so I
can blot the grease off my tongue

Kate hands over a napkin Carrie licks it Beth begins
doing surgery on her sandwich - the other girls’ watch as she
removes the meat patty from her burger removes the cheese
replaces the tomato and lettuce and squirts about a quart of
ketchup and mustard onto it She takes a bite notices that
she’s being watched

BETH
Being a vegetarian sucks I want a
personal thank you note from every stupid
cow and chicken I haven’t eaten

( )

CARRIE
Okay here’s where we are I’ve already
convinced John that we should show a video
for his campaign speech

HEATHER
A video that let me guess you’ll be
editing

BETH
Isn’t he going to want to see it before you
show it

CARRIE

I’m going to make two I make a real one
to show him where he talks about all the
things that make him a good candidate -
loyalty honesty

KATE
And we make another one where we cut ina
bunch of stuff about what a sleazebag he
really is

HEATHER
Gee I hope there’s not some mix-up and we
end up showing the wrong video to the whole
school It would ruin him

They laugh

KATE
To get the footage we need we’re going to
need a lot of equipment - microphones
hidden cameras

HEATHER
Beth that’s you

BETH
I don’t know anything about electronics

HEATHER
Yeah but you’re rich

BETH
Hey I don’t like labels My parents may
buy into the whole bourgeois lifestyle but
that doesn’t mean I have to It’s their
money not mine

CARRIE
If we agree that you’re a poor repressed
member of the underclass can we use one of
your fifty credit cards

( )

BETH
Sure

Beth digs through her purse pulls out credit cards
one to each girl

BETH (CONTD)
AmEx Blue Visa Platinum
(sentimental)
Oh my first Master Card We’ve had some
fun haven’t we

She reluctantly hands it over
BETH (CONTD)
Be careful with him His little magnetic

strip’s almost worn off

INT HEATHER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

hands

Heather’s bedroom is covered with bags from electronics
stores and spy stores Beth and Carrie are playing with
monitors binoculars etc Heather’s in just a bra as Kate

tries to attach a camera with fumbling hands

KATE
All right almost there Sorry I’ve never
done this

HEATHER
Put a camera on someone or groped a girl

KATE
Well neither

Kate gets the camera on

KATE (CONTD)
There how does that feel

HEATHER
Well the camera kind of pinches but
youve got soft hands

Beth turns on a monitor - we see a huge distorted close up of

Kate’s face as shot through the camera

BETH
Whoa

KATE
How do I look

( )

BETH
Tres bad angle - straight up your nose
Take two steps back from Heather’s breasts

Kate does

BETH (CONTD)
Much better The lighting still isn’t
great Try turning to the left

CARRIE
Oh we’re not doing this to get glamor
shots of Kate Kate speak into the
cleavage

Carrie puts on a pair of headphones as Kate steps back up to
Heather

KATE
Um testing One two Testing

CARRIE
Okay it’s good There’s kind of an echo
but it’s good

HEATHER
What do I want him to say

CARRIE
Well we want him to act like a sleazy
horndog so

HEATHER
Just let him be himself

BETH
That’11 work

Carrie pulls out her notebook starts writing

KATE
Sorry do you mind if I ask what are you
always writing in there

CARRIE
Just my lists You know normal stuff
same as everyone

(off their blank looks)

I’ve got my “to do” list which is
subdivided into my “to do today” “to do
one time” “to do weekly” you know

(MORE )

( )

CARRIE (CONTD)

Then there’s my “goals” list again “high
school” “college” and “life” my
“contingency” lists in case one of my goals
or to do items doesn’t work out the way I
expected my “observations” my “notions”
which yes are very different and of
course a few ideas for the screenplay I
plan to write during my summer in Belize
Or Toronto depending on the political
climate Don’t you all do this

KATE
No No one does that Martha Stewart
would meet you and go “you know she’s a
little anal for my taste”

CARRIE
Well it works for me

BETH
What happens if you lose the book

CARRIE
You’re not going to freak me out that
easily I have a duplicate at home and I
copy the changes in every night

BETH
Yeah but what about all the
“contingencies” and “notions” you come up
with during the day They’d just be
gone forever

Carrie processes this Her eyebrow twitches The girls go
in for the kill

HEATHER
Yeah maybe you should carry a third book-

KATE
Stored in a separate location from the main
book of course-

BETH
Right and then you should immediately copy
everything that happens into both of those
books

Carrie starts hyperventilating The other girls laugh

KATE

Come on we’re just messing with you
HEATHER

Yeah I think you’1ll be okay with two

books
( )

CARRIE
(laughs )
Sure you’re right Good one

Everyone returns to their food As soon as they’re not
looking at Carrie concern crosses her face and she clutches
her book tightly - she’s been thrown

HEATHER

Yeah I’ll say The tough thing would be
getting him to tell the truth

( )

The other girls laugh at Carrie’s eagerness She blushes

KATE
Wait a second that’s not a bad idea We
should get some tape of him with his
friends being himself You know for
contrast

HEATHER
Maybe this is crazy but what if one of us
snuck in the locker room I mean it’s the
one place that they know girls aren’t
around

CARRIE

naked man flesh

They laugh at Carrie again

CARRIE
I do want to go and not why you think I

think Come on throughout history no
one’s understood them - I’m about to get a
glimpse into the heart of the male psyche

SCOTT
I’m not making fun of you I’m asking if

bad in the last experiment and he won’t be
back for awhile

KATE
Before I say “yes” how exactly did he get
burned

SCOTT

Well that’s open to interpretation He
says it was my fault but I clearly said
“Dear God Run for your life”

KATE
Sounds like his fault

SCOTT
Thank you So what are we doing

KATE
Let’s stay away from fire what do you say
(hands him a vial)
Why don’t you measure five milliliters into
that beaker

KATE (CONTD)
You’re not even close

SCOTT
I’m not

KATE
Youve got to get down at eye level and
wait until the bottom of the meniscus is at
the line

( )

SCOTT
Check you out “Meniscus” If I would
have known how smart you were I would have
set my last partner on fire weeks ago

KATE
Did I say “meniscus” I meant wait until
the curvy part is at the doodad

Scott laughs

SCOTT
Much better Okay I‘1l try

Scott pours again but carelessly splashes some on his pants
He starts to freak urgently whispering to Kate

SCOTT (CONTD)
I spilled it What do I do What is it

about the man who’s going to be your next

He wipes away a fake tear

HEATHER’S POV

( )

JOHN (CONTD)
Friday Huh Yeah the thing is I have a
game Saturday so I promised myself I’d do

JOHN’S POV

John looks into the audience sees angry faces sees people
laughing at him his worst nightmare Then he sees the

three girls who betrayed him all beaming

BACK TO SCENE

John swallows his eyes darting wildly looking like he
actually might crack then he takes a deep breath and steps

up to the mic Showtime

JOHN
Could we get the camera on

John appears on the large screen above his head

JOHN (CONTD)
I’d like to talk to the girls in the
audience
(to camera operator)
Closer on my face if you wouldn’t mind

The camera zooms in John gives that disarming smile that no

mortal can resist

JOHN (CONTD)
Ladies I have a problem and I guess you
all know about it now I love too deeply
When I’m with a girl when I look into her

eyes see who she really is I fall in
love I can’t help it I guess I’ma
romantic

Our girls look around - the other girls in the audience are

hypnotized by John’s big eyes staring into theirs

JOHN (CONTD)
I know I look like a player but the truth
is I meant every word I said to every one
of those girls The sad thing is no
matter how much I want it I haven’t had
that great love returned yet I haven’t
found that one girl who is the only girl
for me I haven’t found that one person
who I can give myself completely to who I
can tell my secrets who I can cry with
share my pain hold hug

Back in the audience two female teachers are standing next
to each other They’re as smitten as anyone One leans over

and whispers to the other

FEMALE TEACHER
Is he eighteen yet

( )

JOHN
So as you can see I keep looking And I
promise you I will find her Maybe it’s
you I don’t know But if it is I’m
going to find you and I’m going to give
you my heart to do with as you will

Girls are now crying Everyone in the entire place - except
our girls - is convinced that they’re the one Heather leans
over to Beth

HEATHER
He just seduced the entire school

BETH
He just seduced half the school And Bill

Angle on a boy who looks just as smitten as the girls

HEATHER
Yeah I guess you’re right That speech

LORI
Howd that happen

KATE

doesn’t matter what he does it’s how he
looks doing it I’m so depressed Change
the subject to something good will you

LORI
I met someone

KATE
(groans )

LORI
Well this might be good He’s well

running for Mayor I’m volunteering on his

INT PARKING LOT - DAY

Heather

arrives in her car climbs out notices that Carrie

also just arrived They lock eyes for a moment but don’t

talk

Beth is

They turn and head for school when Kate runs up

KATE
Hey there you guys are I tried to call
everyone but I guess I missed you How
you doing

CARRIE
How do you think We blew it We had one
shot at him and we blew it

HEATHER
He’s more popular than ever and now none
of us get him

KATE
So now what

CARRIE
It’s over We stop hanging out together
we go back to our own little groups and
watch John date his way through the rest of
the cheerleaders

HEATHER
Hey

CARRIE
It was a compliment

HEATHER
It didn’t sound like one

BETH (0S)
Heather Carrie Kate

running across the parking lot

BETH (CONT’D)
Good We’re all here I figured it out

CARRIE
What that video thing doesn’t look like
it’s going to work out after all

BETH
No that we’ve been going about it wrong
I was home last night crying and stuffing
my face-

( )
44

HEATHER
Tell me about it I can’t eat again until
June
BETH

And I thought “I can’t believe it I let
this guy break my heart twice” And that’s
when it hit me We’ve been trying to
humiliate him and maybe that’1ll never
work But we never did the most obvious
thing We have to do to him what he does
to girls We have to break his heart

CARRIE
That’s great in theory but how

HEATHER
I don’t think he has a heart to break

BETH
Come on we know everything about him We
know his strengths and his weaknesses we
know how he operates we know what he
thinks What if we used all of that to
make him fall in love really fall in love
and then break him Maybe we can’t make it
so that other women won’t want to date him
but we can make it so that he won’t want to
date anyone else

The girls are taken in by her passion but
CARRIE
How He knows we all went after him with

the video He’ll never trust us again - he
hates all of us

BETH
Not all of us

Beth turns to Kate Heather and Carrie also turn to Kate

KATE
You want me to No No way
CARRIE
This is really smart
BETH
Thank you
HEATHER
She’s a blank slate - we can make her into
anything

( )

KATE
Guys hold on It’s a great idea but I’m
not the person to do it

BETH
Why not

KATE
I don’t like him I don’t like anyone like
him He’s a shallow manipulative jerk
Let me ask you - would any of you want to
date him now knowing everything you know

The girls think it over

HEATHER
Well

CARRIE
Probably not

BETH
Do you really think he’d go out with me
(off their looks)
Definitely not

KATE
So why should I

BETH
Look you won’t really be dating him
Youll be pretending

KATE
I’m not that good an actress Sorry

The girls’ passion fades

HEATHER
Yeah you’re right It probably wouldn’t
work
CARRIE
(to Beth)

It was a good idea

BETH
Whatever All right

The girls all turn and walk away
KATE
Hey Carrie could I catch a ride after

school

( )

CARRIE
(without looking back)
I’ve got some errands to run

KATE

Beth doesnt even bother answering Kate stands very very
alone watching the three girls walk away She sighs

KATE (CONTD)

weight over her a hand in her face

MOLLY
(forced smile)
Someday

KATE
What if I pass out and fall

Kate climbs up looking a little unsteady but finally gets
to the top She smiles - this is pretty cool

HEATHER (CONTD)
See you’re fine

KATE

Kate’s beaming on top of the world She throws her arms up
in the air and immediately falls off the top of the pyramid
Luckily her landing is cushioned - by Molly’s head Molly
collapses

KATE (CONTD)
I’m so sorry Molly Are you okay

( )

MOLLY
Yeah I’m-

With Molly getting knocked down the pyramid is unstable
Molly looks up just in time to see all the girls above her
come crashing down on top of her She’s buried

speaks up

NANCY
I think I’1ll be better before Molly is

BETH

You just saw him seduce an

that charm on you

This hits home

He’s the best at what he

she might not be as ready as she thought she was

You can do this but you have to be
careful Kate John’s an athlete

competition He wants to win not
just have his victory handed to him
you blush and pass out when he winks at

likes

CARRIE

you he’s going to lose interest

Exactly
If it’s too easy he’1ll move on

you

HEATHER

you understand

Absolutely I really do I’ve got it

KATE

under control

BETH

He really called you cute

KATE

Yeah that’s what Heather-

(catching herself)

Damn it

The girls laugh

Look
eager

CARRIE

it’s not that hard Just don’t be
When he says something count to
three in your head before you answer

(MORE)

So you’ve got to make him chase

Do

Kate’s eyes go wide - she starts to realize

( )

CARRIE (CONTD)
Don’t show any interest in him Don’t even
look at him too much Don’t touch him not
even his hand Got it

Kate doesn’t answer

CARRIE (CONT’D)
I said do you have it

KATE
I was counting to three

HEATHER
Not that slowly We don’t want him to
think you’re deaf

KATE
All right he’s noticed me now how do we
know he’1l take the bait

HEATHER
He will I know John I know cheerleaders
I know John and cheerleaders

Kate shrugs - they’1ll see Everyone heads out
INT HALLWAY - LATER

We’re outside a classroom The bell rings and the door
opens Heather and Kate come out to find John standing right
there waiting

JOHN
We just keep bumping into each other I
think it’s fate

Heather winks at Kate walks off Kate counts to three
then

KATE
What’s up

JOHN
As the president of the school Welcome
Wagon it’s my official responsibility to
invite you to dinner Friday night

KATE
That’s mighty welcoming but I’m going to
have to take a pass
John looks stunned This doesn’t happen

JOHN
You busy or

( )

KATE
Sure I’m busy Nice meeting you John

Kate walks off Once John can’t see her she breaks out into
a smile obviously pleased with herself A passing Beth
whacks her with a book and glares at her - Kate curses

herself silently and stops smiling

INT LAB -— LATER

Scott’s working at his station - flames suddenly shoot three
feet out of his Bunsen burner He grabs at the gas turns it
off Kate enters the room in her cheer uniform and crosses

to join him He looks up surprised

SCOTT
Huh
KATE
What
SCOTT
Nothing it’s just you’re on the track
team I thought you were an athlete not

a cheerleader

KATE
What you don’t think cheering is athletic
I had to kick my leg in the air four times
today

She does half a kick to illustrate Scott laughs
SCOTT

Nice but I don’t think it really qualifies
as a sport If I can do it-

He kicks his leg in the air promptly knocking over a row of

beakers smashing them

KATE
(laughing)
Impressive We’re looking for a male
cheerleader if you’re interested

As Scott cleans up

SCOTT
You know I never see you out

KATE
Out where

( )

SCOTT
At parties around I know you’re new
If you’re interested I could let you know
when something’s going on

KATE
Thatd be great

SCOTT
Actually there’s a party this weekend I
could tell you where it is

KATE
Id love that

SCOTT
Or I could you know pick you up

KATE
Wait are you asking me out

SCOTT
No I’m just not good at directions
Giving them or following them So I just
thought it would be easier to pick you up

There’s a commotion at the door - Kate looks to see a boy
enter the room carrying flowers He goes up to the teacher

SCOTT (CONTD)
I mean if you want me to ask you out I
suppose it could be that too I don’t
want to compromise our great working
relationship as lab partners but-

Kate didn’t hear distracted by the scene at the door

KATE
I’m sorry what

SCOTT
Oh I was just saying-

The teacher points at the door
TEACHER
No you can’t interrupt my class Where
are you supposed to be

FRESHMAN BOY 1
I’ve just got to drop these off

The freshman walks over to Kate hands her the flowers heads
out Everyone is staring at Kate who’s blushing

( )

TEACHER
Okay if we could get back to

The door opens another boy enters with more flowers He
crosses to Kate hands them over

TEACHER (CONTD)
What’s your name You can’t just come in
here

FRESHMAN BOY 2
Sorry

He runs out The door opens a second later another boy
more flowers He crosses to Kate and drops them off We
follow this boy out into

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

At least a dozen boys are lined up in the hall all holding
bouquets At the end of the line is a kid in a gorilla suit
also holding flowers

INT BATHROOM - LATER

Kate is in the bathroom with her three friends Despite
herself Kate’s a little excited

KATE
Did you see all the flowers

HEATHER
Classic Tucker

KATE
And the singing telegram Not that I care
but no one’s ever done anything like that
for me

CARRIE

Wait until the picnic on his family’s boat
KATE

Which I totally won’t be impressed by

(then)
How big is it

HEATHER
You could land a helicopter on it

BETH
Yeah it’s almost as big as his
(the other girls looks at her)
Vacation house What I think about
things other than sex
(MORE ) ( )

BETH (CONTD)
(chuckling to herself)
Although we did have some awesome sex in
that vacation house And the greenhouse
And the-

KATE
Well no matter how big anything of John’s
is I promise not to be impressed

CARRIE
That’1l throw him He won’t know what to
do

HEATHER

This is actually working We’re playing
his game and we’re going to win

(to Kate)
Youre going to be the girl who makes John
Tucker fall in love You’re going to be a
legend

Kate looks at her friends all looking to her with respect
It’s the first time something like this has ever happened to
her and she likes it

EXT OUTSIDE SCHOOL - LATER
Students are heading out of the building at the end of the

day Scott John and some of his jock friends are hanging
out by the door John turns to Scott

JOHN
You know that new girl Kate
SCOTT
She’s not your type
JOHN
Girl is my type Well except for the
uggos
SCOTT

Well then you’re definitely not hers
She listens to Elvis Costello she reads
Salinger for fun not for class she’d
see through you in a second

JOHN
You’re selling me short I can pretend to
be deep when I need to

Scott just shakes his head as Heather Kate and a couple of

other cheerleaders exit the school John raises his shades
and nods to Kate

( )

JOHN (CONTD)
Hey Kate you get the flowers

KATE
(without stopping)
I didn’t know what to do with them so I
sent them over to the nursing home My
grandma and her friends flipped thanks

Kate smiles and disappears towards the parking lot John
scowls - why isn’t this working

ScoTT
Maybe if we headed down to the nursing
home you’d have a chance with her grandma

John chuckles which the other guys take as their cue that
it’s okay to laugh along

JOHN
I’m glad she’s playing hard to get The
local girls have been so easy for so long
I’d almost forgotten how to do this

ANGLE ON Two geeky freshman girls taking in the scene
Then they turn and watch Kate as she walks away

FRESHMAN GIRL 1
(awed)
I can’t believe her If John Tucker gave
me flowers I’d go out with him ina
second

FRESHMAN GIRL 2

If John Tucker gave me gum I’d have his

baby
INT HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
Another basketball game -- we pan slowly across the crowd
seeing all the same kids we saw in the opening scene
Everyone yells and applauds and off screen we hear the
cheerleaders

CHEERLEADERS (0S)
Gla Di A Tors Gla Di

ANGLE ON Kate in her cheer outfit

KATE
A-tors

( )

Widen to reveal all the cheerleaders clapping and kicking
The referee blows the whistle and both teams head from the
sidelines back onto the floor Kate edges over to Heather so
they can speak privately Kate’s back is to the game

KATE (CONTD)
I don’t think our plan is working

HEATHER
Relax

KATE
I screwed it up He hasn’t looked at me
since I turned him down the other day

HEATHER
Kate I promise this will work

KATE
How do you know

Heather points over Kate’s shoulder Kate turns to find John
standing next to her dribbling the ball

JOHN
Kate Spencer How ya doin’

John’s near mid-court -- under the basket the game is still
going on All four of his teammates are shouting for the
ball and the defenders are looking on confused Every
other eye in the gym is on Kate

KATE
Fine How about you

JOHN
Not so good I like this girl but I don’t
think she knows I exist

The gym is going nuts The shot clock is winding down
10 9 8 John’s teammates are panicking clapping
their hands to get his attention and his coach is turning
red he’s so furious

COACH
SHOOT THE BALL

JOHN
Excuse me

John turns shoots from thirty five feet away swishes it
He turns back to Kate

( )

JOHN (CONTD)
So what do you say There’s a party over
at Dan’s house and I was thinking-

KATE
Uh John

The other team inbounds the ball and starts sprinting up the
court John sticks out his arm and clotheslines the player
with the ball -- he hits the ground hard The ref blows the
whistle for a foul The coach runs over to John yelling the
whole way

COACH
What are you doing Why’d you foul him

JOHN
To ask Kate out

The coach takes a deep breath tries to keep from strangling
John He glares at Kate

COACH
Well

The entire gym is hanging on her answer

KATE
(casual to coach)
If it’ll make him play fine

Everyone erupts in applause
INT KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kate’s sitting in a chair wearing a robe as the other three

HEATHER

HEATHER

BETH

CARRIE

( )

The other two open their mouths to object Beth just plunges
ahead

BETH (CONTD)

JOHN
(laughs )
You are impressive

KATE
(too eager)

Really

John reaches across Kate opens his glove box flips through
a stack of CDs He takes his time choosing finally finding
the perfect one He slips it in - it’s Elvis Costello’s
“Uncomplicated” Not a hit that everyone would know but not
so obscure that a fan wouldn’t love it He starts singing
along Surprisingly he’s a great singer and he’s obviously
been practicing this song

Kate is surprised after a few lines she interrupts him

KATE (CONTD)
You like Elvis Costello

JOHN
If you tell me you don’t I’m kicking you
out of the car right now

KATE
No I love him I mean he’s all right I
guess

singer
JOHN

musical or something

John laughs

JOHN

KATE (CONTD)
Mom what I meant to say was I love you
and there are a ton of things I’d come to
you for advice about just not this You
have to admit that you’ve had your share of
troubles with guys like John Tucker so you
might not be too objective all right

clear she’s still wounded

licking folding and stamping with the best of them Her mom
comes up with the candidate himself

LORI
Kate I’d like you to meet Sal Valetta

KATE
It’s a pleasure to meet-

( )

Kate looks up smiling then blinks in disbelief
KATE’S POV

Behind Sal’s shoulder is one of his posters Kate stares at
it then the real thing comes into focus - a perfect match
except that in real life his ears stick out so far they look
like they’re coming after you It’s truly disturbing - Kate
looks back and forth between the photo and the man

BACK TO SCENE
Sal turns around sees the photo and chuckles

SAL
I know I still can’t get used to having
big Sals staring at me either

KATE
(carefully choosing her words)
It’s a very good picture

SAL
Just between us Good lighting and a lot
of makeup

Kate laughs politely Someone taps Sal on the shoulder he
turns away from Kate to talk to them

LORI
So what do you think
KATE
He seems great mom really
LORI
Handsome
KATE

No not that
Lori laughs

KATE (CONTD)
But that’s good It’s different

LORI
Very Hey that guy over there is waving
at you

Lori points - Kate turns and sees Scott

KATE
Scott

( )

LORI
Who

KATE
It’s John’s brother Scott

Scott crosses over

SCOTT
Hey Kate

KATE
What are you doing here

SCOTT
Im here to volunteer

Lori clears her throat

KATE
Sorry Scott this is my mom

SCOTT
Nice to meet you

Scott politely shakes her hand turns back to Kate

SCOTT (CONTD)
So where’s the candidate

Kate points - Scott sees Sal

SCOTT (CONTD)
Holy crap
(quickly recovering)
I’ve never seen a real candidate before

Kate grabs Scott’s hand and pulls him away They move as
fast as they can trying not to look at each other because
every time they do they laugh Finally when they’re a safe
distance away

KATE
So what are you doing here

SCOTT

What are you doing here I’m always
volunteering for political campaigns

(off her look)
All right John sent me It’s his way of
keeping an eye on you without making it
look like he’s keeping an eye on you I’m
supposed to play it cool make sure you’re
actually here not give anything away

( )

KATE
Youre like the worst spy in the world

SCOTT
Or am I the best spy in the world

Kate shakes her head pulls Scott through the crowd
INT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - LATER

Kate and Scott sit across from each other at a table licking
envelopes Scott nods at one of the posters

SCOTT
I hope this guy doesn’t make any speeches
outside You know a gust of wind comes up
and suddenly

Scott mimes Sal flying away as his ears catch the wind

KATE
I saw him trip once - it took three minutes
to hit the ground

Scott lowers his voice and points across the room

SCOTT
Id be careful He’s only forty feet away -
I’m sure he can hear you

KATE
Hear me He can take my pulse

Across the room Sal sees Kate and Scott looking over smiles
and gives a big thumbs-up They wave back

KATE (CONTD)
Oh my god I think you were right

At least Kate tries to say that but all the glue from
licking the envelopes messes up her speech and what she
really says is

KATE (CONTD)
Oh my gob I think you bere ribe

SCOTT
(laughing teasing her)
Excuse meeb

KATE
I thing my tonbue is tuck

( )

SCOTT
It’s almost like your tongue is stuck
KATE
Stob it
SCOTT

Stob it ribe now

Kate’s laughing so hard she almost falls out of her chair
After she calms down a bit

SCOTT (CONTD)
Listen I’ve got to ask you something Why
are you going out with my brother

Kate stops laughing completely takes a sip of a soda to
clean off her tongue

KATE
(trying to be casual)
Why do you ask

SCOTT
The first time I saw you you didn’t seem
too impressed by him

KATE
You know what they say about first
impressions

SCOTT
That they’re always right

KATE
Is that what they say I’ve been using
that saying wrong for a long time

SCOTT

You just seemed like the kind of girl who
wouldn’t go for him

(shrugs )
I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised
Everyone dates my brother

(quickly)
But I’m sure you’ll be the last I’m sure
you’re the one Hey these envelopes
aren’t going to lick themselves

Scott busies himself with an envelope Kate joins him

EXT OUTSIDE EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

John’s BMW pulls up in front of the restaurant As John gets
out of the car a valet walks up to the passenger door but
John waves him off and opens the door himself giving Kate
his hand and helping her out of the car

KATE (VO)

So I finally let John take me to dinner
I’ve got to be honest - I know it’s an act
but John Tucker makes you feel like the
only woman in the world

As John and Kate enter the restaurant Kate discovers that
INT EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT - SUNSET
They’re the only people there One table is set - it’s in
the window overlooking a lake Every other table is covered
with candles which provide the only light in the place
It’s breathtaking
DISSOLVE TO
INT EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT - LATER
They’re seated at their table as four waiters come out from
the kitchen - two pick up their salad plates then the other
two set down the next course all perfectly synchronized
KATE (VO)

He rented out the best restaurant in the

city just for us Complete with

entertainment

Three men come out dressed up like a barbershop quartet
except well there are three of them They begin singing

BARBERSHOP TRIO
Kate Kate Kate

John slides in front of them on his knees providing the
missing voice

JOHN
Kate

They sing as Kate laughs

KATE (VO)
After that we went for a little ride

EXT ROAD - DAY

Kate and John sit next to each other in a horse drawn
carriage blanket over them sipping out of mugs

KATE (VO)

Taxis are so gauche don’t you think I’m
travelling everywhere in one of these from
now on

EXT YACHT - NIGHT

John and Kate sit on the deck of John’s family yacht Kate
looks over the rail as the ship cruises along the stars
lighting their way

JOHN
It’s so great you run track Did you know
that women who compete in sports are
seventy five percent less likely to be the
victim of abuse

Kate laughs

JOHN (CONTD)
What

KATE
Do you ever turn it off

JOHN
(extra suave)
Turn what off my dear

KATE
Okay I guess you don’t

JOHN
No seriously what do you mean

KATE
Seriously do you ever take a break and
just be John Tucker

JOHN
This is John Tucker

KATE
No that’s John Tucker trying to impress
Kate Spencer by talking about how great
women’s track is What do you want to talk
about What do you really care about

( )

JOHN
Well I love basketball Hey speaking
of that there’s an away game coming up
Well be out of town maybe we can spend a
little time together

KATE
Quit changing the subject What do you
care about besides basketball

JOHN
I don’t know No one’s ever asked me that
before

John thinks laughs

JOHN (CONTD)
I don’t even know if I love basketball My
dad taught me how to play when I was like
three and I’ve just done it Huh
(then)
Would you still like me if I didn’t play
basketball

KATE
(uncomfortable)
There’s a lot more to you than basketball

JOHN

Well you’d say that because you’re
different than most girls Most girls want
to be with me because of what I am not who
I am Everyone thinks it’s one sided -
John Tucker only dates the hot chicks But
a lot of those girls only date the stud
athlete or the rich guy

(then light bulb)
You know there is one thing I love besides
basketball It’s kind of stupid and
embarrassing

KATE
No go ahead

JOHN
We actually talked about it before I
wish I were brave enough step up on a stage
and perform I don’t think anything would
make me happier than to look down connect
with my audience and just

He stares into Kate’s eyes and begins singing

JOHN (CONT’D)
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

( )

John can’t help it - he’s back in seducer mode Kate busts
out laughing

INT GYM - NIGHT

The cheerleaders are standing on the sidelines of a different
gym - they’re the visiting team - as the game is going on

Up in the stands Carrie and Beth sit together taking it in
A boy sitting in the stands gets up to ask Kate a question
and Kate leans close so she can hear him On court John
notices can’t look away and trips and falls on his face

BETH
God was he ever that infatuated with any
of us

CARRIE

Of course not He was always in charge
It was always us falling over our feet

They take this in for a moment

BETH
How far do you think we can push him

CARRIE
I think it’s time to find out

Carrie pulls out her notebook reviews the well-worn page
with the plan on it

CARRIE (CONT’D)
(reading)
“Make Kate Date Bait” Done

BETH
Do they have to rhyme

CARRIE
No it’s just nice when they do
(reading)
“Play hard to get” “Make him chase”
“Don’t follow Beth’s lead and give it up on
the first date”

BETH
It does not say that

CARRIE
Just seeing if you’re listening Okay
time to “see how far he’s willing to go for
love”

( )

BETH
You only make a fool of yourself if you’re
in love
CARRIE

So let’s find out And if it turns out
he’s ready then we can go ahead and

She holds out her notebook to Beth
BETH
(reading)
“Make John’s heart smart”
(then)
Not your best work

CARRIE
I was stretching

Beth notices something

BETH
Hey it does say that about me giving it
up

Carrie slams her book shut

CARRIE
Come on focus

Carrie stands and walks out Beth following looking peeved

She’s looking at a sign that Carrie’s holding up Carrie
glares scribbles on it holds it back up

( )

KATE (CONTD)
Lonely I’m so lonely

JOHN

KATE
That’s just what I was thinking But

in the hall and coach Williams is totally
watching No way you could get here

JOHN
Damn it

KATE
I mean unless you went out on the ledge
and came in through the window

JOHN
(laughs )

Kate lets her robe slip off one shoulder showing off one bra
strap

JOHN
I could try the ledge

KATE
Awesome I’m five windows down I already
counted

JOHN

I’m on my way
The girls high five and pump their fists - it’s working
Suddenly Beth gets an idea - she holds up her hand
gesturing madly

body You know like a swimmer

JOHN

things about me Eyes hair ass There
was a poll in the school paper

Carrie scribbles on a piece of paper Kate reads

KATE
If you love me you’ll do it
(then)
I didn’t want you to but when you said you
wouldn’t I know if I loved someone
there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for them

John hesitates This is a biggie

Carrie yawns Kate follows suit gives a huge yawn for
John’s benefit then pulls her robe back on

KATE (CONTD)
You know what Maybe you’re right I’11

JOHN
No Wait Give me five minutes

KATE

Kate blows John a kiss Carrie closes the computer The
girls burst out laughing

INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER

The room is completely dark - the only light comes from
outside And then through the window we see John inching
along the ledge He’s in the shadows but it’s clear he’s
just wearing boxers and nothing else No hair on his head
or his body He pushes open the window and climbs in

In the room he spots the bed sees the person sleeping in
it He climbs into bed (Now that he’s in the room it’s
impossible to see anything but vague shapes )

JOHN
Oh Kate

( )

WOMANS VOICE
Oh Darryl

JOHN
Darryl Who’s Darryl

WOMAN’S VOICE
Whos Kate

JOHN
You mean Coach

The light beside the bed flips on John’s got a big surprise
- he’s in bed with Coach Williams the girls’ cheer coach
She lets out a high pitched scream John lets out a higher
pitched one

INT HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

People are filing out of their rooms to see what all the
commotion is about Carrie and Beth aren’t there but
Heather and Kate are part of the growing crowd

Coach Williams comes out of her room John in tow He’s
still wearing his boxers and Coach Williams is using them as
a handle to pull him along She’s got them hiked so far up
that there isn’t much breathing space left inside them

JOHN
No Dear god Hurts so much
Please Not that They mean so much

to me

We get our first good look at John in the light he is
completely utterly blindingly hairless

The crowd in the hall have their mouths hanging open what
the hell is going on Finally the people get over their
shock enough to begin laughing Heartily

A FLASH - Heather’s got a camera and just got a prime
picture John looks at the camera in a daze then notices
Kate Kate looks sheepish

KATE
Sorry I guess it was six windows

Finally John’s coach comes into the hall

COACH
What the hell is going on here

COACH WILLIAMS
Darryl I think this Chihuahua belongs to
you I found it in my bed
( )

JOHN
Please make her let go

Coach Williams lets go and pushes John towards his coach who
grabs his arm and leads him away in shame People are
falling over themselves laughing and pointing as he goes

INT HALLWAY —- DAY

John walks down the hall shaved head on display People
point and whisper as he walks a few girls giggle

KATE (VO)
John’s aura was punctured Don’t get me
wrong - he was still John Tucker and he
managed to put a good spin on it almost
immediately

John meets up with a bunch of other guys from his basketball
team - they now all have shaved heads They high five
admire each other

EXT TRACK —- DAY

Late afternoon Kate trains alone sprinting around the track
as fast as she can really pushing

KATE (VO)
But he was in love he was getting
desperate he was almost ready for the big
fall All I had to do was deliver And
nothing was going to get in my way

Kate stops in her tracks

KATE (CONTD)
Scott

Scott stands on the side of the track He applauds

SCOTT
I think you won

KATE
I’m the only one running

SCOTT
I know how smart are you

Kate laughs As she talks she steps up and down in place

keeping her muscles warm Scott notices starts stepping
along with her

( )

KATE
Okay you can stop making fun of me any
time I’ve just got to keep moving so I
don’t cramp up

SCOTT

(looks at his legs)
Wow I didn’t even notice I was doing it
It’s like when you talk to a guy with an
accent and you start doing the accent

(Indian accent)
I am having much fun dancing with you
Please try the papadums

KATE
Okay were stopping

Kate stops Scott follows suit

SCOTT
You sure you’re not going to cramp up I
mean you were jogging at a pretty torrid
pace

KATE
You want to race Come on I just did five
miles I’1l still slaughter you

SCOTT
No way I’m just a big talker Absolutely
nothing to back it up

Kate laughs then grabs at one leg staggers forward

KATE
Ow OW OW

She collapses into Scott’s arms Scott picks her up carries
her over to a bench and sets her down

SCOTT
I guess you weren’t kidding I’m almost
feeling guilty for making fun of you

He kneels down in front of her works on the cramping calf
massaging it

KATE
“Almost” What would it take to make you
feel guilty

SCOTT
Oh something big Like a leg falling off

( )

KATE
Nice

Kate and Scott laugh Scott looks up at Kate

down at Scott his hands are on her leg

Kate looks

and all of a

sudden things are weird There’s a definite vibe in the

air They both immediately get uncomfortable

of her leg and stands up

SCOTT
Feeling better

KATE

After a long pause

KATE (CONTD)

INT GIRL’S BATHROOM —- DAY
Our four girls are gathered in the bathroom

HEATHER

It smells in here I’m getting tired of

meeting in bathrooms

CARRIE

We’re almost done then we don’t have to

sneak around any more I’ve figured it out
- I’ve got the perfect place to finish him

off

KATE
Yeah about that maybe we’ve done
enough

BETH

What are you talking about

( )

KATE
I mean we made the guy look like an idiot
at the hotel

HEATHER
That He’s bounced back from a lot worse
than that

CARRIE

Yeah we haven’t done nearly enough This
is just part of the plan We hook him
then we crush him All we’ve done is hook
him

KATE
I know how much you love plans I’m just
not sure how much more we need to do

The girls stare at her Not happily

KATE (CONTD)
It’s just feeling kind of I don’t know
weird

Finally Carrie snaps

CARRIE
What kind of crap is this

HEATHER
Are you falling for John Is that it You
want him for yourself

KATE
Look at what this guy does You’re as
obsessed with trying to destroy him as you
were with dating him You’re still letting
him control you

Beth holds up her hand to calm the other two She goes over
to Kate puts her arm around her playing good cop

BETH
Look I know it’s tough but we’re almost
done Let’s just finish John off then
you’re done You never have to think about
him again

KATE
I don’t know

HEATHER
Jeez Kate I thought we were friends

( )

ee

Heather

KATE
We are Aren’t we

HEATHER
I thought so But friends look out for
each other Friends don’t say they’1ll do
something and then

searches for the right words Carrie supplies them

CARRIE
Completely screw everyone over

BETH
Come on Kate If you’re not going to do
it for your friends then what about doing
it to send a message to the John Tuckers of
the world If we don’t teach him a lesson
he’s just going to go start ruining other
girls’ lives You know it

KATE
All right all right Momentary lapse
I’m fine What’s your idea

CARRIE

Get ready because this is great

(then)
You know how the elections are next week
Well Kate is going to be the one to
announce the winners and she’s going to
break up with John right there in front of
the whole school

HEATHER
What the hell

CARRIE
It’s perfect Everyone’s there cameras
are rolling he’s ready to be have the
whole school choose him as their leader
and we destroy him

HEATHER
No no no-

BETH
What’s your problem This is a great idea

HEATHER
It’s a horrible idea Do you know who
announces the election results

CARRIE
A cheerleader which is why-

( )

HEATHER
The head cheerleader She’s the designated
spirit representative for the entire
school Now I know you think that’s a big
joke but it’s not to me

BETH
So We make Kate the head cheerleader

CARRIE
Good it’1ll make it even more painful when
he’s dumped by the head cheerleader
Heather loses it screams

HEATHER
Hold on one freakin’ second

She finally has everyone’s undivided attention

HEATHER (CONTD)
Im head cheerleader Not her

CARRIE
Heather come on-
HEATHER
No no “Heather come on” This is a

popularity contest and I’m the most
popular girl in school Well I’m sorry
but it’s true The girls in my family have
always been the head cheerleader since I
don’t know the pilgrims

CARRIE
Look we’ve got a plan and we’re going to
follow it We all have to make sacrifices

HEATHER
Oh really
(re Beth)
What did she sacrifice Her parents’
money

BETH
Hey don’t attack me It was Carrie’s
stupid idea

CARRIE
You said it was great

HEATHER
(to Carrie)
And you what did you sacrifice Why don’t
you make Kate the editor of the newspaper

( )

CARRIE
I would if I thought it would help

HEATHER
No you wouldn’t If you gave up one of
your precious activities you’d never get
into Hartford

Silence Then

CARRIE
Do you mean “Harvard”

Heather screams in frustration starts for Carrie The other
girls grab her and hold her back Heather takes a deep
breath relaxes when the other girls let her go she
snatches Carrie’s notebook and goes over to the sink

HEATHER
You want to talk sacrifices Fine

Heather turns on the water and starts moving the notebook
towards it

HEATHER (CONTD)
I hope you haven’t had any good notions
today
Carrie wails

CARRIE
Heather stop Everyone made sacrifices

She turns to Beth for help

BETH
(reaching)
Sure Um Carrie didn’t you say that

you got a “B” on a trig test because you
were putting so much work into this plan

CARRIE
A minus

Heather growls
CARRIE (CONTD)
Wait wait wait And Beth She doesn’t get
to hook up with John anymore

BETH
That was really great

No sale Heather pushes the notebook towards the water

( )

CARRIE
Kate say something

KATE

Uh okay Listen Heather no one’s
going to deny that you’ve made the biggest
sacrifices But come on nothing could
make me more popular than you The only
reason I’m popular at all is because you’ve
taken me under your wing Just hanging out
with you makes everyone think I’m somebody

CARRIE
Absolutely You totally rule this school
Everyone knows it

BETH
Carrie’s right As much as I say I reject
the paternalistic power structure of high
school the truth is I’d give my right arm
to be head cheerleader

HEATHER
(softening)
You wouldn’t be much of a cheerleader with
one arm

CARRIE
The only reason I never tried out for cheer
is that I was afraid I wouldn’t make it

HEATHER
It would help if you were a little taller
But you probably could have made it

CARRIE
Are we okay

HEATHER
Were okay

They all hug Carrie snatches her notebook from Heather
cradles it in her arms like a baby

INT KATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN
Kate’s in the kitchen on the phone
KATE
No sorry she’s still not here but the
second she gets home I’11-

Lori walks in the room sees Kate on the phone starts
shaking her head violently

KATE (CONTD)
Oops nope not her but I’1l1 let her know

KATE (CONTD)
He’s called three times

LORI

other anymore

KATE

LORI
Excuse me

KATE

LORI
Kate who I date is none of your business

KATE
Are you serious

LORI
Yeah I am

( )

KATE
Do you know how screwed up that is You
really think dating all those guys moving
to all those places didn’t effect me

LORI
I know it’s been hard making friends with
the moving-

KATE
It’s not just friends - can you imagine
what it’s like growing up with this All
I’ve done is watch you date jerks who ruin
our lives I’ve started to think all guys
are like that I mean could my dating
life be more screwed up The first serious
relationship I’ve ever had is with a guy I
don’t like who has no idea who I really am
Thanks Thanks a lot Good thing who you
date is none of my business

Kate storms out of the room

No I’ll get it
KATE
Everything okay
SCOTT
Everything’s great Everything okay with
you
KATE

Yeah sure Things are just a little
Kate makes a “mixed-up” motion with her hands

SCOTT
Yeah I’ve been getting a little of-
(makes same gesture)
That too

( )

KATE
I think it started when-

SCOTT
Hold that thought You’ve got a visitor

Scott points to the door John is there waving Perfect
timing Kate walks out of the room

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Kate joins John

JOHN
Listen I was wondering if you want to get
together tonight - we haven’t really seen
each other since the trip

KATE
Yeah tonight’s not great I’m just really
busy these days - it’s cheer season and
I’ve got to keep my focus

JOHN
But soon

KATE
Absolutely I’11 call you

JOHN
Hey I hear everyone saying you’re the new
head cheerleader

KATE
Yeah crazy isn’t it

JOHN
Not so crazy You are dating John Tucker

He flashes his million dollar smile but it’s looking a
little less convincing than usual

KATE
Yeah Okay see you

Kate heads back into the class John just stands watching
her go He doesn’t look good He kind of looks like a
desperate girl who’s being ignored by the guy she loves
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Kate walks down the hall - it seems that everyone knows her
talks to her congratulates her

( )

KATE (VO)
The week leading up to the election seemed
to last about a minute it was so packed
I sure wasn’t invisible any more - I
couldn’t go anywhere without everyone
knowing who I was

INT ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Kate is waiting on an elderly couple

ELDERLY WOMAN
So Kate what’s going on with you and John
Tucker

INT KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Kate’s asleep in bed something wakes her

KATE (VO)
John got more and more desperate every day
And night

She looks out her window to find John standing down there
guitar in hand warbling Dashboard Confessional’s “Screaming
Infidelities” His usually impressive voice is cracking
interrupted by the tears running down his face Kate closes
the curtains lies back down puts a pillow over her face

INT CAFETERIA - DAY

Kate walks through the cafeteria with another cheerleader
talking

KATE (VO)
We didn’t want John to fall completely
apart before we had a chance to destroy him
publicly so I did spend some time with
him

Kate and the cheerleader sit down at a table and we see that
John’s behind them struggling with their books and trays
loaded down with food He sets everything down for them
when he’s done Kate pats him on the arm to thank him then
turns back to her friend John waves weakly and walks away
from the table

INT KATE’S KITCHEN - DAY
Kate is sitting across the table from her mother They’re

both reading as they eat not making eye contact not
acknowledging each other’s presence

( )

KATE (VO)
So the plan was rolling along At home
Not so much My mom and I hadn’t talked
since our fight Well that’s not
precisely true - I asked her to pass me the
potatoes once and she asked me if I’d
picked up toilet paper at the store So
you know the lines of communication were
open

INT STARBUCKS - DAY
Kate sits with the other three girls

KATE (VO)
And before I knew it it was the day of the
election The buzz around school - started
by Carrie - is that something was going to
happen It was the first time politics
were ever popular We got together that
morning to work on my speech It was
tough but we found five synonyms for the
word “womanizer” and seventeen for “dump”
At last it was finally going to be over

we could get our lives back I was
thinking nothing could possibly go wrong
now

They finish they all get up and head out of the cafe Kate
is the last to leave - she goes over to the trash to throw
away her cup and turns towards the door when she’s surprised
to find Scott standing there Looking extremely confused

KATE (VO) (CONT’D)
It never pays to think like that

KATE (CONT’D)
(busted)
Scott Hey Good to see you

SCOTT
Since when are you friends with those
three

KATE

Well Heather’s a cheerleader with me you
know that And I just know the other
two From around

SCOTT
And since when are they even friends I
didn’t realize that little video they made
about John had brought them so close
together

( )

KATE
I didn’t know they didn’t get along

SCOTT
No they’ve always hated each other And
yet here they are still together with
you Pretty mindblowing Pretty crazy
coincidence that the three girls who tried
to humiliate my brother are best friends
with his girlfriend What’s going on

Kate has no answer

SCOTT (CONTD)

God I was so wrong about you I thought
you were different than everyone else then
youre hanging with them you end up
falling for my brother-

KATE
I didn’t

Scott waits for her to explain herself

KATE (CONTD)

Look you said yourself that your brother
was a jerk I mean you’ve watched him
hurt all those girls dating them lying to
them dumping them We just thought we’d
give him a taste of his own medicine

SCOTT
So it was just some game the three of you
cooked up making him fall for you and
then what You’re going to dump him

Kate nods

SCOTT (CONTD)
At the assembly Of course

(then)
You want to hear something ironic Do you
know why he fell for you Because you were
the first person who was honest with him
The first person who treated him like a
human being

This lands hard on Kate

KATE
Are you going to tell him

( )

SCOTT
No
(then)
He probably does deserve it in some way

KATE
That’s what I thought that’s why I agreed
to go along with this-

SCOTT

In some way he does deserve it but in
another way Look do you really think
it’s all his fault He is what he is He
doesn’t really go out of his way to hide
it So who’s to blame - him or the girls
who keep lining up to date him even
knowing everything they know about him

(then)
And what’s his big sin really Lying to
women to get them to fall in love with him
God that’s horrible I bet you can’t
imagine what kind of person would do that
can you Kate

Scott turns and exits leaving a shattered Kate
INT LORI’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Lori sits in a chair reading when Kate knocks softly on the
door and sticks her head in

LORI
Why aren’t you in school Everything okay

KATE
I needed to talk to you

Kate sits on the bed

KATE (CONTD)
I know I told you I don’t need your advice
about boys Well I need your advice about
boys

LORI
You know I’1l always try I can’t promise
I won’t suck but I’11 try

KATE
Okay Do you think I’m doing the right
thing you know dumping John tonight

Tough question right off the bat Lori searches for words

( )

KATE (CONTD)
I know you didn’t think this was a good
idea from the beginning but it’s too late
I’m in and I need to know what to do

LORI
Okay Well John’s a real bastard right

KATE
I don’t know Maybe there’s more to him
Maybe there’s an actual person there

LORI
He did hurt all your friends

KATE
Yeah he did And if I don’t go through
with it they won’t be my friends anymore

LORI
You don’t love him do you

KATE
No I don’t love him

Kate shakes her head trying to sort it out

KATE (CONTD)
So I can ruin the life of a guy who’s
never done anything to me and keep the
best friends I’ve ever made in my whole
life or I can not dump him and lose my

friends
LORI
Okay just give me a second
KATE
Tough one huh
LORI
And the thing that kills me is it’s all my
fault
KATE

Mom it’s not your fault-

LORI
What you said the other day You were
right How were you supposed to know how
to act if I didn’t show you How were you
supposed to learn about men when I was
always dating bums

( )

KATE
Well you told me not to do this

LORI
Yeah one good idea after seventeen years
of screwing you up Kate you’re
beautiful you’re smart you’re fun - you
deserve to be popular you deserve to date
whoever you want to All you needed was a
chance I’m sorry for being selfish

KATE
Thanks
(then)
So what do I do

LORI
(beat then)
You want to know something sad The first
thing that popped into my head is “let’s
move to a new town and start over”

Kate laughs
LORI (CONT’D)

I’m sorry I’m really trying but I just
don’t know

KATE
Don’t worry I’1ll figure it out This
helped

LORI
Did it

KATE

Not really but I can tell you’re hanging
by a thread

Lori laughs

KATE (CONTD)
You know you don’t always date bums

LORI
I’m afraid I have
KATE
What about Sal
LORI
Well he’s no John Tucker I’1l grant you

that

( )

KATE
Maybe that’s a good thing

LORI
Youve got to get to school We don’t have
enough time to fix me

They hug
INT GYM - DAY

The gym is draped with campaign paraphernalia the stands are
packed with students It’s go time Around the audience we
see Beth Heather and Carrie none of them standing together
and John standing at the front with the other candidates
One of them Norman turns to John

NORMAN
Where’s Kate She wasn’t in Biology

JOHN
Shell be here

NORMAN
I saw her this morning and then she
disappeared

JOHN
You saw her this morning
(starting to come unhinged)
How’d she look Mad Do you think she’s
coming Have you heard anything You
don’t think she just won’t show do you

Finally whispers run through the room and everyone turns and
looks at the door as Kate comes into the room She nods and
makes small talk with the people she passes as she moves into
the gym

The PRINCIPAL glances at his watch steps to the microphone
PRINCIPAL
Well since our designated spirit
representative has shown up let’s get this
started
He covers the mic turns to a teacher standing next to him
PRINCIPAL (CONTD)
(whispering)
Is she dumping him

TEACHER
That’s what I hear

( )

Kate gets to the stage The principal hands her an envelope

KATE
Hi everyone Thanks Before I announce
the winners Id like to say something
about one of the people up on this stage
I know this is unusual but bear with me
As some of you know I’m not completely
objective about this election I’ve been
dating John Tucker for awhile now I’ve
learned alot and I think it’s time I share
it all with you

A murmur from the crowd here it comes

KATE (CONTD)
Sometimes you think you know a person
Especially popular people - you think that
smiling friendly face they put on is the
real person Sometimes they even start to
believe it about themselves If everyone
loves them they couldn’t be so bad could
they But I’m afraid that sometimes that
person is rotten to the core they’re a
liar and a cheat and they’ve gotten their
popularity by using people and then casting
them aside They hurt people that they’re
supposed to care about and that’s just
unforgivable There are no excuses for
that kind of behavior and anyone who does
that should be punished

Heather Carrie and Beth are practically gleeful all their
work is about to pay off Carrie holds a camcorder up to
capture the moment

KATE (CONTD)
As you’ve probably guessed the person I’m
talking about is me

Gasps and shock all around

KATE (CONTD)
I used John I did everything I could to
get him to fall in love with me because I
knew that if he did I’d be popular And
it worked Here I am But to do it I was
lying to all of you about who I really was
and I had to hurt John who’d never done
anything to me I’m sorry

KATE (CONTD)
I don’t deserve to be standing up here I
don’t deserve all the attention I’ve been
getting

(MORE ) ( )

KATE (CONTD)

(to John)
And I don’t deserve you I think that
buried deep deep deep inside of you
there’s a really sensitive wonderful guy
that’s going to come out for the right
girl I’m not her I hope you find her

(back to audience)
Thanks again for everything I know I’m
giving up a lot by doing this including
some really great friends but I didn’t
really earn any of it So goodbye

She starts to walk off pauses goes back to the mic

KATE (CONTD)

One more thing Why do we all make fools
of ourself chasing after the John Tuckers
of the world anyway Why are we so busy
defining ourselves by other people I
don’t have an answer I just thought it was
a good question

(then)
Oh and also since I probably wont ever
have everyone’s attention like this
again It wouldn’t kill you all to come
out to a girls’ track meet once in awhile

And with that Kate walks off the stage leaving behind a
stunned crowd John looks at the crowd looks at Kate
disappearing and runs after her

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE GYM - CONTINUOUS

John catches up with Kate

JOHN
Wait-

KATE
John don’t I’m really not the right
person for you

JOHN
I kind of get that now

KATE
Look I’m sorry-

JOHN
Don’t be sorry Actually I just wanted to
thank you

KATE
Thank me

( )

JOHN
Yeah You could have destroyed me out
there All those things you were saying
they’re true about me too We’re alike in
a lot of ways

KATE
That was kind of the twist Tricky huh
JOHN
I’m going to work on it
KATE
Really
JOHN

I’m still not sure how you did what you did
to me but it made me think about a lot of
things Who I am Why I do what I do

Who I hurt I guess I’m feeling

KATE
Compassion

JOHN
I don’t know but I don’t like it

They laugh John holds out his hand

JOHN (CONTD)
Good luck Kate

KATE
Good luck

They shake hands Kate goes in and kisses him on the cheek
She then turns and exits the building

KATE (VO) (CONTD)
And then as I was walking out of there I
realized that there was one person who
noticed me before John did One person who
did seem to like me for who I was
FLASHBACKS

Scott coming up to Kate at the water fountain and talking and
joking with her

Scott asking Kate to be his lab partner
Scot talking to Kate at the party
Scott and Kate at the campaign laughing with each other

( )

Scott helping her with the cramp in her leg

KATE (VO) (CONTD)
And one person who amazingly didn’t forget
I existed the second he met my mom

Scott meeting Lori at campaign headquarters shaking her
hand and immediately looking right back to Kate

EXT OUTSIDE GYM - CONTINUOUS
Kate exits the gym and walks out into the night
KATE (VO)
But I figured my chances with him were
slightly damaged by the fact that he hated

me

SCOTT (0S)
Kate

KATE (VO)
Luckily I was wrong

Kate turns to find Scott running to her When he catches
her

SCOTT
Does this mean you’re not dating my brother
anymore
KATE
I think so
SCOTT
Finally
And he moves in to kiss her It’s going to be the most
beautiful moment ever and she stops him
KATE

What do you think you’re doing

SCOTT
Kissing you Romantically Although every
second we talk about it it’s becoming less
romantic and more uncomfortable You’re
just looking at me Time is passing It’s
getting really bad now

KATE

And just exactly long have you been
attracted to me

( )

SCOTT
I think I suspected it when I first saw
you and I was sure when you glued your
tongue to your mouth

KATE
So why didn’t you say anything You know
this is all kind of your fault You should
have asked me out the second you met me
not taken “no” for an answer and saved me
from this whole mess

SCOTT
I’m sorry

KATE
(smiles )
So am I

And he kisses her She returns the kiss and they embrace
not letting go

KATE (VO) (CONT’D)
So what happened to everyone

INT GYM - NIGHT

We’re in the middle of a game - John’s standing on the
sideline as his coach yells at him

KATE (VO)

Even though it didn’t happen quite how we
hoped we still ended up teaching John
Tucker a lesson and changing him forever

John finally snaps and yells back at his coach

JOHN
What’s the matter with me What’s the
matter I’11 tell you I don’t want to
play basketball I hate basketball I
want to sing I want to sing

INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

John stands front and center belting out a song to a packed
house

JOHN
Oklahoma Where the wind comes sweeping
down the plains

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

A high school couple walks hand in hand towards a car They
split up - the boy goes to the driver’s side the girl to the
passenger side

KATE (VO)
Amazingly another John Tucker didn’t
spring up to take his place From that
time on the guys at our school treated the
women like princesses

The girl makes no move to open her own door glances over at
her boyfriend He runs around the car opens her door for
her waits for her to get in and closes the door

KATE (VO) (CONTD)
After seeing what women could do to even
the mighty John Tucker when we put our
minds to it they were scared to death of
us

INT STARBUCKS - DAY
Kate sits alone

KATE (VO)
What about the other girls Like I said
we were just together to take care of John
Tucker and once that was done there was
no reason to hang out

The other three join Kate at the table setting down drinks
and muffins

KATE (VO) (CONT’D)
No reason except that we were all pretty
amazing people who taught each other that
men come and go but friends are forever
We stayed close until the end of high
school and we still meet once a year to
celebrate the day we saved the world from
John Tucker

The girls all clink their coffee cups together in a toast
INT KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Lori walks to the front door
KATE (VO)
Mom turned out to be more mature than she

thought with a little help from me of
course

( )

She opens the door to find Sal at the door holding a huge
bouquet of flowers He’s got a new hairstyle - it’s long and
comes down over the ears Lori and Sal embrace we now see
that Kate is watching from the top of the stairs Sal gives
her a thumbs-up Kate points to his hair and flashes him an
okay sign

KATE (VO) (CONT’D)
He’s easily the ugliest new dad I ever had
but he’s easily the best
(then)
Who’s left Oh right

EXT TRACK - NIGHT

Kate is running sprints while Scott times her They’re the
only people at the track

KATE (VO)

Scott was the luckiest one of all - he got
me And what about me How did I turn
out

Kate finishes running catching her breath with her hands on
her hips She walks along then looks straight up into
camera
KATE (VO) (CONTD)

I’m the girl who made John Tucker fall in

love I’m a legend
Kate smiles

FADE OUT

THE END
