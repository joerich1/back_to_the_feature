their daily lives

small night table and an empty basket adorn the room A stack
of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed He is flipping

through a book at about a page a second

advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard--

Everyone groans

LAMBEAU

accomplishment recorded and their
name printed in the auspicious M1T

CUT TO
EXT SIDEWALK --CONTINUOUS

Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA calling out from
across the street

WILL
(smiling good
naturedly)
Hey Bobby Champa I went to
Kindergarten with you right Sister
Margarets class

Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure
of Wills intentions Just when it looks as though Bobby
might remember him Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which
begins the
FIGHT SEQUENCE 40 FRAMES OVER M GAYES LETS GET IT ON

Wills momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the
hapless Champa out cold

As soon as Will hits Bobby his friends CONVERGE ON WILL
Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground The two
exchange messy punches on the sidewalk

Will is in trouble back pedaling dodging punches trying
to avoid being overrun

When Will goes for one guy another has an open shot and he
HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head

Will is staggered and bleary as a second guy winds up for a
shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he
was a tackling sled lifting him off the ground

Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered Its all Will
can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champas
boys from the hood of a car

Contrary to what we might think Morgan is actually quite a
fighter He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows

The fight is messy ugly and chaotic Most punches are thrown
wildly and miss heads are banged against concrete someone
throws a bottle

In the end its our guys who are left standing while Bobbys
friends stagger off Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will
standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa still POUNDING
him

ANGLE ON WILL SAVAGE UGLY VICIOUS AND VIOLENT

Whatever demons must be raging inside Will he is taking
them out on Bobby Champa He pummels the helpless unconscious
Champa fury in his eyes Chuckie and Billy pull Will away

The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only
witnessed Wills vicious attack on Champa they grab him

The cop holding Will SLAMS his Wills face into the hood
another cop uses a baton to press Wills face into the car
The look of rage returns to Wills eye

WILL
Get the fuck off me

Will resists Another cop comes over Will KICKS HIM IN THE
KNEE dropping the cop Momentarily freed Will engages in a
fracas with three cops More converge on Will who -- though
he struggles -- takes a beating

takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited
environment with mock pomposity and good humor

LAMBEAU
Is it my imagination or has my class
grown considerably

Laughter

LAMBEAU
I look around and see young people
who are my students young people
who are not my students as well as
some of my colleagues And by no
stretch of my imagination do I think
youve all come to hear me lecture

More laughter

LAMBEAU
But rather to ascertain the identity
of who our esteemed The Tech has
come to call The Mystery Math
Magician

He holds up the MIT Tech featuring a silhouetted figure
emblazoned with a large white question mark The headline
reads Mystery Math Magician strikes again

LAMBEAU

Whoever you are youve solved four

of the most difficult theorems Ive
ever given a class So without further
ado come forward silent rogue and
receive thy prize

The class waits in breathless anticipation A STUDENT shifts
his weight in his chair making a noise

LAMBEAU
Well Im sorry to disappoint my
spectators but it appears there
will be no unmasking here today Im
going to have to ask those of you
not enrolled in the class to make
your escape now or for the next
three hours be subjected to the
mundities of eigenvectors

People start to gather their things and go Lambeau picks up
a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board

LAMBEAU

However my colleagues and I have
conferred There is a problem on the

years to prove So let this be said
the gauntlet has been thrown down
But the faculty have answered the
challenge and answered with vigor

Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher
all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars

CHUCKIE
So this is a Harvard bar huh I
thought thered be equations and
shit on the wall

INT BACK SECTION BOW AND ARROW -- MOMENTS LATER

Chuckie returns to a table where Will Morgan and Billy have
made themselves comfortable He Chuckie spots two ATTRACTIVE
YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar

Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair
He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston
accent

CHUCKIE
Hey hows it goin

LYDIA
Fine

SKYLAR
Okay

CHUCKIE

So you ladies ah go to school here

LYDIA
Yes

CHUCKIE
Yeah cause I think I had a class
with you

At this point several interested parties materialize Morgan
Billy and Will try as inconspicuously as possible to situate
themselves within listening distance A rather large student
in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt CLARK notices Chuckie
He Clark walks over to Skylar and Lydia nobly hovering

over them as protector This gets Will Morgan and Billys
attention

SKYLAR
What class

CHUCKIE
Ah history I think

SKYLAR
Oh

CHUCKIE
Yah its not a bad school

At this point Clark cant resist and steps in

CLARK
What class did you say that was

CHUCKIE
History

CLARK
Howd you like that course

CHUCKIE
Good it was all right

CLARK
History Just history It must
have been a survey course then

Chuckie nods Clark notices Chuckies clothes Will and Billy
exchange a look and move subtly closer

CLARK
Pretty broad History of the World

CHUCKIE
Hey come on pal were in classes
all day Thats one thing about
Harvard never seizes to amaze me
everybodys talkin about school all
the time

CLARK
Hey Im the last guy to want to
talk about school at the bar But as
long as youre here I want to seize
the opportunity to ask you a question

Billy shifts his beer into his left hand Will and Morgan

see this

Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say not again

CLARK
Oh Im sure you covered it in your
history class

Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed They are not

When Clark looks back to Chuckie Skylar turns to Lydia and

rolls her

own eyes They laugh Will sees this and smiles

CHUCKIE
To tell you the truth I wasnt there
much The class was rather elementary

CLARK
Elementary Oh I dont doubt that
it was I remember the class it was
just between recess and lunch

Will and Billy come forward stand behind Chuckie

CHUCKIE
All right are we gonna have a
problem

CLARK

Theres no problem I was just hoping
you could give me some insight into
the evolution of the market economy
in the early colonies My contention
Will

is completely fed-up

is that prior to the Revolutionary

War the economic modalities especially
of the southern colonies could most
aptly be characterized as agrarian
precapitalist and

WILL
Of course thats your contention
Youre a first year grad student
You just finished some Marxian
historian Pete Garrison probly
and so naturally thats what you
believe until next month when you
get to James Lemon and get convinced
that Virginia and Pennsylvania were
strongly entrepreneurial and
capitalist back in 1740 Thatll
last until sometime in your second
year then youll be in here
regurgitating Gordon Wood about the
Pre-revolutionary utopia and the
capital-forming effects of military
mobilization

CLARK
(taken aback)
Well as a matter of fact I wont
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of--

WILL
Wood drastically underestimates the
impact of social distinctions
predicated upon wealth especially
inherited wealth You got that
from Work in Essex County Page
421 right Do you have any thoughts
of your own on the subject or were
you just gonna plagiarize the whole
book for me

Clark is stunned

WILL
Look dont try to pass yourself off
as some kind of an intellect at the
expense of my friend just to impress
these girls

Clark is lost now searching for a graceful exit

WILL
The sad thing is in about 50 years
you might start doin some thinkin

who at this point has migrated to Chuckies side and
includes himself in the conversation

any exit
on your own and by then youll realize
there are only two certainties in
life

CLARK
Yeah Whatre those

WILL
One dont do that Two -- you
dropped a hundred and fifty grand on
an education you coulda picked up
for a dollar fifty in late charges
at the Public Library

Will catches Skylars eye

CLARK
But I will have a degree and youll
be serving my kids fries at a drive
through on our way to a skiing trip

WILL

(smiles)
Maybe But at least I wont be a
prick

(beat)
And if you got a problem with that
I guess we can step outside and deal
with it that way

While Will is substantially smaller than Clark he
decides not to take Will up on his Wills offer

WILL
If you change your mind Ill be
over by the bar

Clark

He turns and walks away Chuckie follows throwing Clark a

look
Morgan turns to a nearby girl

MORGAN
My boys wicked smart

INT BOW AND ARROW AT THE BAR -- LATER

Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some
as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where
players shoot miniature balls at a small basket In
occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting Larry When

Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will

SKYLAR
You suck

amusement

I wasnt going to keep sitting there
waiting for you

WILL

SKYLAR
Skylar And by the way That guy
over there is a real dick and I just
wanted you to know he didnt come

WILL
I kind of got that impression

SKYLAR
Well look I have to go Gotta get
up early and waste some more money
on my overpriced education

WILL
I didnt mean you Listen maybe

SKYLAR
Heres my number

Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to
Will

SKYLAR
Maybe we could go out for coffee
sometime

WILL

Great or maybe we could go somewhere
and just eat a bunch of caramels

SKYLAR
What

WILL
When you think about it its just
as arbitrary as drinking coffee

SKYLAR
(laughs)
Okay sounds good

She turns
WILL
Five minutes

SKYLAR
What

WILL
I was trying to be smooth
(indicates clock
But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna
come over there and talk to you

SKYLAR

INT COURTROOM -- DAY

Will stands before JUDGE MALONE being arraigned It is
fairly unceremonious the courtroom nearly empty save Will
and the PROSECUTOR Lambeau walks in from the back

WILL
There is a lengthy legal precedent
Your Honor going back to 1789
whereby a defendant may claim self-
defense against an agent of the
government where the act is shown to
be a defense against tyranny a
defense of liberty--
The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor

JUDGE MALONE
Mr Simmons Officer McNeely who
signed the complaint isnt in my
courtroom Why is that

PROSECUTOR
Hes in the hospital with a broken
knee Your Honor But I have
depositions from the other officers

WILL
Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed in
his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit
back in 1887 that Every American
citizen is by birth a sworn officer
of the state Every man is a
policeman As for the other officers
even William Congrave said he that
first cries out stop thief is oft
he that has stolen the treasure

PROSECUTOR
Your Honor--

Will cranks it up

control over -- and you are ina
sense hiding that by becoming a
janitor And Im not saying thats
wrong Im friends with the janitor
that works in my building Hes
been to my house for dinner As a
matter of fact I did some free
consultation for Mike -- thats
not his real name Thats in my book

WILL
Yeah I read your book Mike had
the same problems as Chad the
stockbroker

PSYCHOLOGIST
Yes The pressures you feel and

fulfilling your potential -- youre
in a rut So stop the Tom Foolery --

Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone Tired
of teaching tired of life he finds himself resigned to the
tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student

important component in making
breakthroughs with a patient Why

SEAN
Keep up the good work Maureen
Vinnie
VINNIE looks up
VINNIE

Because trust is an important thing

SEAN
Dont bullshit me Vinnie Didnt
your brother give you the notes
Okay If a patient doesnt trust you
then they wont feel safe enough to

be honest with you -- then theres
no point to them being in therapy
Its like saying -- Fine come here

and dont tell me a thing but go
home feeling like youre doing
something about your problems -- and
give me my fifty bucks before you
leave will ya

He looks around the room for approval No one is listening

SEAN
If you dont help them trust you --
then theres no way youll ever get
them to sleep with you And that
should be the goal of any good
therapist Insecure women you know
nail em when theyre vulnerable
thats always been my motto

The students look up somewhat stunned

See I got Vinnies attention

from this basic text he was able to
extrapolate theories that had baffled
mathematicians for years

SEAN
And he mailed it to Hardy--

LAMBEAU
Thats right Sean He mailed it to
a professor at Cambridge who
immediately recognized the brilliance
in his work and brought Ramanujan to
England

Where he contracted pneumonia and
died at a young age--

Chapel Youve never stood there and
looked up at that beautiful ceiling
And if I asked you about women Im
sure you could give me a syllabus of
your personal favorites and maybe
youve been laid a few times too
But you couldnt tell me how it feels
to wake up next to a woman and be
truly happy If I asked you about
war you could refer me to a bevy of
fictional and non-fictional material
but youve never been in one Youve
never held your best friends head
in your lap and watched him draw his
last breath looking to you for help
And if I asked you about love Id
get a sonnet but youve never looked
at a woman and been truly vulnerable
Known that someone could kill you
with a look That someone could rescue
you from grief That God had put an
angel on Earth just for you And
you wouldnt know how it felt to be
her angel To have the love be there
for her forever Through anything
through cancer You wouldnt know
about sleeping sitting up ina
hospital room for two months holding
her hand and not leaving because the
doctors could see in your eyes that
the term visiting hours didnt
apply to you And you wouldnt know
about real loss because that only
occurs when you lose something you
love more than yourself and youve
never dared to love anything that
much I look at you and I dont see
an intelligent confident man I dont
see a peer and I dont see my equal
I see a boy Nobody could possibly
understand you right Will Yet you
presume to know so much about me
because of a painting you saw You
must know everything about me Youre
an orphan right

Will nods quietly

SEAN
Do you think I would presume to know
the first thing about who you are
because I read Oliver Twist And I
dont buy the argument that you dont
want to be here because I think you
like all the attention youre getting
Personally I dont care Theres
nothing you can tell me that I cant
read somewhere else Unless we talk
about your life But you wont do
that Maybe youre afraid of what
you might say

Sean stands

SEAN
Its up to you

put it under my side of the bed but
it got to where she was gettin to

My wifes been dead two years Will
And when I think about her those
are the things I think about most
Little idiosyncrasies that only I
knew about Those made her my wife
And she had the goods on me too
Little things I do out of habit
People call these things imperfections
Will Its just who we are And we
get to choose who were going to let
into out weird little worlds Youre
not perfect And let me save you the
suspense this girl you met isnt
either The question is whether or
not youre perfect for each other
You can know everything in the world
but the only way youre findin that
one out is by giving it a shot You
sure wont get the answer from an
old fucker like me And even if I
did know I wouldnt tell you

WILL
Why not You told me every other

changed the world Sean Can you

up Or gotten drunk with his buddies

would have lost something And Im
quite sure Timmy never would have
heard of him

just hasnt got the direction We
can give that to him

SEAN
He married his cousin

Einstein Had two marriages both
trainwrecks The guy never saw his

night twisting my mustache and
hatching a plan to ruin the boys
life But its important to start
early I was doing advanced

took me twenty-three years to do
something worthy of a Fields medal

WILL
Hows it goin

SKYLAR
Fine

WILL
Want me to take a look

SKYLAR
No

WILL
Cmon give me a peek and well go
to the battin cages

SKYLAR
Its important that I learn this

WILL
Why is it important to you If I
inherited all that money the only
thing important to me would be workin
on my swing

SKYLAR
Clearly

WILL
Youre rich What do you have to
worry about

SKYLAR
Rich I have an inheritance Its
two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars Thats exactly what itll
cost me minus about five hundred
bucks to go all the way through med
school This is what Im doing with
that money I could have done anything
I wanted I could have expanded my
wardrobe substantially

WILL
Instead youre going to bust your
ass for five years so you can be
broke

SKYLAR
No so I can be a doctor

A beat Will nods She looks down then up
SKYLAR
All right Mr Nosey Parker Let me
ask you a question Do you have a
photographic memory

WILL
I guess I dont know How do you
remember your phone number

SKYLAR
Have you ever studied Organic
Chemistry

WILL

Some a little

SKYLAR
Just for fun

WILL
I guess so

SKYLAR
Nobody does organic chemistry for
fun Its unnecessary Especially

for someone like you

WILL
Like me

SKYLAR
Yeah Someone like you who divides
his time fairly evenly between the
batting cages and bars

Will laughs

SKYLAR

How did you do that I cant I

the keys you see music you see
Mozart

SKYLAR
I see Hot Cross Buns but okay

WILL
Well all right Beethoven He looked
at a piano and saw music The fuckin
guy was deaf when he composed the
Ode to Joy They had to turn him
around to take a bow because he
couldnt hear the crowd going crazy
behind him Stone deaf He saw all
of that music in his head

SKYLAR
So do you play the piano

WILL
Not a lick I look at a piano and I
see black and white keys three pedals
and a box of wood Beethoven Mozart
they looked at it and it just made
sense to them They saw a piano and
they could play I couldnt paint
you a picture I probably cant hit
the ball out of Fenway Park and I
cant play the piano--

SKYLAR
But you can do my O-chem lab in under
an hour you can--

WILL
When it came to stuff like that I
could always just play

Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will the Robot-pimp
So much so that Skylar has to kiss him then push him away

Will drops it on the floor Lambeau drops to his knees and
puts it out He looks up at Will

A beat Will has obviously been stewing on this

WILL
Say Im working at NSA Somebody
puts a code on my desk something
nobody else can break So I take a
shot at it and maybe I break it And
Im real happy with myself cause I
did my job well But maybe that
code was the location of some rebel
army in North Africa or the Middle
East Once they have that location
they bomb the village where the rebels
were hiding and fifteen hundred people
I never had a problem with get killed
(rapid fire) Now the politicians are
sayin send in the Marines to secure
the area cause they dont give a
shit It wont be their kid over
there gettin shot Just like it
wasnt them when their number got
called cause they were pullin a
tour in the National Guard Itll be
some guy from Southie takin shrapnel
in the ass And he comes home to
find that the plant he used to work
at got exported to the country he
just got back from And the guy who
put the shrapnel in his ass got his

A beat

old job cause hell work for fifteen
cents a day and no bathroom breaks
Meanwhile my buddy from Southie
realizes the only reason he was over
there was so we could install a
government that would sell us oil at
a good price And of course the oil
companies used the skirmish to scare
up oil prices so they could turn a
quick buck A cute little ancillary
benefit for them but it aint helping
my buddy at two-fifty a gallon And
naturally theyre takin their sweet
time bringin the oil back and maybe
even took the liberty of hiring an
alcoholic skipper who likes to drink
seven and sevens and play slalom

with the icebergs and it aint too
long til he hits one spills the
oil and kills all the sea-life in
the North Atlantic So my buddys

out of work and he cant afford to
drive so hes got to walk to the job
interviews which sucks cause the
shrapnel in his ass is givin him
chronic hemorrhoids And meanwhile
hes starvin cause every time he
tries to get a bite to eat the only
blue-plate special theyre servin

is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker
State

WILL
So whatd I think Im holdin out
for somethin better I figure Ill
eliminate the middle man Why not
just shoot my buddy take his job
and give it to his sworn enemy hike
up gas prices bomb a village club

join the National Guard Christ I
could be elected President

Why do you think he does that Gerry

LAMBEAU

He can handle the work he can handle
the pressure and hes obviously
handled you

the first thing that happened to him
was that he was abandoned by the
people who were supposed to love him
the most

friends Because any one of those
kids would come in here and take a

SEAN

And who do you think hes handling
He pushes people away before they
have a chance to leave him And for
20 years hes been alone because of
that And if you try to push him
into this its going to be the same
thing all over again And Im not
going to let that happen to him

LAMBEAU
Now dont do that Dont you do that
Dont infect him with the idea that
its okay to quit That its okay to
be a failure because its not okay
If youre angry at me for being
successful for being what you could
have been--

SEAN
--Im not angry at you--

LAMBEAU
Yes you are Sean You resent me
And Im not going to apologize for
any success that Ive had

SEAN
--I dont have any anger at you--

LAMBEAU
Yes you do Youre angry at me for
doing what you could have done Ask
yourself if you want Will to feel
that way for the rest of his life
to feel like a failure

SEAN

Thats it Thats why I dont come
to the goddamn reunions Because I
cant stand the look in your eye
when you see me You think Ima
failure I know who I am Im proud
of who I am And all of you you
think Im some kind of pity case
You with your sycophant students
following you around And your Goddamn
Medal

LAMBEAU
Is that what this is about Sean
The Fields Medal Do you want me to
go home and get it for you Then
will you let the boy--

SEAN
I dont want your trophy and I dont
give a shit about it Cause I knew
you when You and Jack and Tom
Sanders I knew you when you were
homesick and pimply-faced and didnt
know what side of the bed to piss
on

LAMBEAU
Thats right You were smarter than
us then and youre smarter than us
now So dont blame me for how your
life turned out Its not my fault

SEAN
I dont blame you Its not about
that Its about the boy Cause
hes a good kid And I wont see
this happen to him- wont see you
make him feel like a failure too

LAMBEAU
He wont be a failure

SEAN
If you push him into something if
you ride him--

LAMBEAU
Youre wrong Sean Im where I am
today because I was pushed And
because I learned to push myself

SEAN
Hes not you
