FADE IN
EXT WEST HOLLYWOOD - SOMEONE’S POV - A PAN - NIGHT
SUPERIMPOSE LOS ANGELES 1990

We HOLD ON a dark corner in a good neighborhood in the
Hollywood foothills WE HEAR POUNDING FOOTSTEPS and in
the distance TWO JOGGERS appear running down the
street

NEW ANGLE

ON the JOGGERS a GUY and a GIRL The girl is RONDA
RATHBUN and she’s memorably cute 22 or so a brunette we
won’t be able to shake from our memory

When they arrive at a corner they come to a stop but
continue to run in place

RONDA
Go again on Wednesday

GUY
Yeah sure I’11 run you home

RONDA
Three blocks I’11 be fine

The GUY smiles waves and disappears up a block RONDA
continues on down the street We FOLLOW her as she runs

We notice a RED BARRETTE holding her hair in a ponytail
And then WE HOLD as she runs away FROM us passes the
glow of a streetlight and disappears into blackness

POV FROM A CAR (MOVING) - RONDA

As she runs along the shadowy sidewalk oblivious to the
fact that she’s being observed

NEW ANGLE

A DARK SEDAN we can’t really make it out follows her
along the dark street then passes her and disappears
Then far in the distance WE SEE the sedan’s BRAKE LIGHTS

flash and fade

WE HOLD for a few seconds then BOOM UP HIGH ABOVE the
block

LOS ANGELES - NIGHT TO DAWN (INTERVALOMETER)

City lights Hollywood and in the distance downtown on
one side and Century City on the other A dot then a
flicker then a stream of light begins to change
everything Hookers off their corners cockroaches
bedded down rats in their holes Dawn

CUT TO

CLOSEUP - A SPOT OF RED
on pavement surrounded by broken glass
A FINGER touches it

DEKE (0S)
That’s blood

BURNS (0OS)
Good I hope they bleed to death

WE PAN FROM the finger TO its owner DEKE His
Christian name’s JOE DEACON and he wears a sheriffs
deputy uniform plus the toilsome demeanor of someone
who’s seen 100 years’ worth of this world Too bad he’s
only 50

EXT BLACK ANGUS RESTAURANT (BAKERSFIELD) - DAY
SUPERIMPOSE BAKERSFIELD

The restaurant manager BURNS short bald livid stands
over Deacon

BURNS
Third time in two months There’s
47 bulbs in the letter ‘G’ 310
a pop 14570 every time
That’s 13 additional dinners I
gotta sell to float Not counting
lost business Are you listening
to me

Deke stands nods

BURNS
Half our take is from the
Interstate You drive by look
up I mean gastronomically
appealing it’s not

Deke steps back takes a look up at

THE LITTLE THINGS - Rev 92719 (Pink) 3

THE SIGN above the restaurant -- lit bulbs spell out --

INT CAPTAIN DAVIS’ OFFICE - DAY

HENRY DAVIS is 60 soft the foreman of the shop Deke

DAVIS
Remember a punk named JJ
Kendricks

While Deke rummages through his brain

DAVIS
Robbed the Kwik-mart on Yaupon
shot and killed the owner We’ve
got a witness who ID’ed him but
she’s gettin’ the guilts can’t be
absolutely positively sure he’s
the guy All she knows for
certain is he was wearing a really
nice pair of boots Fancy
stitching ‘Unforgettable’ she
says

DEKE
(remembers )
What about the 38 he used

DAVIS
Ah the fog lifts Two searches --
his apartment here and Granny’s in
LA Nada But they came up
with a pair of ‘unforgettable’
bloodstained boots Crime lab ran

vic were eliminated but Kendricks

Is this headed somewhere

DAVIS
Yeah and so are you There’s a
prelim day after tomorrow with a
motion to dismiss You drive to
LA in the morning bring back
the boots she ID’s them and
the judge sets a trial date

Deke grimaces at the prospect

DEKE
Sounds like the DA’s problem to
me

DAVIS

It’s our problem No evidence no
conviction Sheriffs with low
conviction rates don’t get re-
elected

Deke stares then utters a word that’s foreign to him

DEKE
Please

Davis considers the odd plea then shrugs

DAVIS
I got nobody else

- and hands the file to Deke

EXT DEKE’S HOUSE (HIGH DESERT) - DAY

The sun rises on a single adobe house stuck in the middle
of the desert Deke’s Bronco is parked out front

Deke carrying the file exits the house and locks the
door A CUR DOG trots down a dusty ridge and up to him

DEKE
Don’t look at me like that
You’ve been gone for two weeks

The dog rubs against Deke’s pants leg He lifts a boot
and scratches the hound’s back sending the pooch to
Heaven Then Deke walks to the Bronco reaches in and
finds a bone tosses it to the hound

DEKE

look These guys have a history

DEKE

interviewing potential
witnesses

DEKE leans against the wall A REPORTER FLANDERS
slides in next to him Baxter continues in the bg

FLANDERS
Niceta see ya Deke
(re Baxter)
He’s good huh Camera ready

BAXTER mid-answer still eyes Deke who whispers
something to Flanders Flanders raises his hand Baxter
notices but continues

BAXTER

It’s a complicated case with
multiple crime scenes and a
surplus of evidence which will
hopefully lead us to the killer
We’re being both methodical and
light on our feet in our efforts

(points to Flanders)
Yes

FLANDERS
So correct me if I’m wrong but
what I’m hearing is After two
months and four victims you don’t
have a suspect

BAXTER
(holding anger)
None that I can discuss

BAXTER
Lights off

Off go the flashlights Baxter switches on the black
light and the room

LIGHTS UP Fingerprints handprints blood -- on the
wall the floor -- all with a phosphorescent whitish-
green hue The room has transformed into a haunted house
of evidence

DEKE SAL BAXTER -- eyes peeled as the black light

PANS across the room -- past fingerprints blood spatters
-- and finally rests on the very dead body of a 22-year-
old girl lit by a veritable light show taking place all
over her nude body which leans propped against the
front door of the apartment covered in dried blood

BAXTER
Jesus

Then all at once ELECTRICITY COMES ON -- LIGHTS an
electric fan a clock radio -- sensory deprivation to
overload

THE LITTLE THINGS - Rev 101119 (Green) 19

We see too much of everything -- the bloody mattress
bloodstained floor and the body Her name is was

DEKE standing against the wall stares down at the
window ledge -- footprints all over it

DEKE
(sotto to Sal)
Did they lift the prints from this
window

THE LITTLE THINGS - Rev 101119 (Green) 20

Sal turns walks up to Baxter says something and Baxter
glances at the ledge then to Deke then turns to the
room

SAL

A PHOTOGRAPHERLATENT PRINTS MAN moves slowly around the
room TAKING SHOTS of anything and everything --

-- the window blood on the floor spattering of red
against one wall a Schlitz beer can on the dresser the
unmade bed the tennis shoe near the body and finally
moving up the body of the girl to the garbage bag pulled
tightly over her head

A WOMAN with a doctor bag the coroner’s assistant FLO
DUNIGAN steps through the window Shes 45 carries a

medical precision she lifts the victim’s arm at the elbow
to check for rigor

FLO

as he confronts Henderson

BAXTER

protect the premises from anyone
who might spoil it From the
moment she expired to the time I
cuff whoever did this she belongs
to me (ALT We work for her)
You got that Get out of here

HENDERSON nods and exits through the window careful this
time to step over the ledge

Deke watches Baxter appreciating that they are of like
minds

FLO makes a liver incision and sticks a thermometer in
Then she checks for rigor in the fingers toes None

A CRIMINALIST uses a gloved hand to lift a bloody flannel
shirt from the floor He places it carefully in a
plastic bag

Two other TECHS stare at the POOL OF DRIED BLOOD and play
a game of Geographical Rorschach

sedan does just that but instead of passing it pulls
up alongside her

THE GUY IN THE DARK SEDAN -- baseball cap glasses
Peters it’s hard to get a good look but he’s staring
right at her

disappears over a hill We STAY WITH her as she takes a
deep breath and continues on

When she crests the hill she sees

A hundred yards ahead The dark sedan is stopped not
off to the side but in the right lane

She gasps a bit and makes a decision Keeps driving
approaching him and then when she’s close

She steps on the gas and races around and past him He
does the same following behind her at a safe distance
this time

Tina is shaking as she drives There is no one around
In the distance she sees a lit-up gas station and she
floors it

halt jumps out and runs for the front door It’s
locked She spots a cashier window and runs over It’s

sees --

THE DARK SEDAN parked 20 feet behind her car

TINA takes a deep breath and runs racing around the
corner of the station and out into the field behind it
It’s pitch black and she stumbles forward in the dark
After she’s run 75 yards she crumbles to the ground and
dares to look back --

reaches in and carefully puts on a pair of plastic
gloves Then he grabs a duffel closes the trunk and
starts toward --

IN THE FIELD

TINA hand over her mouth hides lying flat between
unplanted rows of dirt The beam of a flashlight
approaches

Every few seconds the sedan driver WHISTLES a “bobwhite’s
call” almost as if hes expecting a return whistle

TINA says a silent prayer as the driver gets closer and
closer the flashlight beam moving back and forth Then
she sees something else -- on the horizon

The lights of an 18-WHEELER cresting the ridge

TINA takes a breath and runs like hell for the --

ROAD

Never looking back she jumps the culvert and races into
the middle of the blacktop playing a game of chicken
with the oncoming truck

THE 18-WHEELER honks then comes to a stop in front of
her

She runs to the drivers side The DRIVER steps down
from the cab and is immediately grabbed by Tina

TRUCK DRIVER
Its okay Its okay Settle
down honey What happened

was chasing me then I stopped and

THE LITTLE THINGS - 92319 (Full Blue) 129

BAXTER
(mumbling)
He was our boy right Joe I

And then he starts to cry Deke watches a few seconds
then pulls Baxter out jacking him up against the truck

DEKE
Nobodys gonna give a damn Ive
taken care of this You listenin
to me You go back tell Farris
that Sparma was a wash and you
need a break A coupla weeks
You tell him I left town on
Saturday and you went home You

DEKE
Its history Forgotten Hes
rotting in the ground and the only
thing he can do to you now is what
you let him Dont ever go back
to his place dont ever pull his
file dont ever let his name
cross your lips ‘Cause if you
do hes gonna rise right up outta
that dirt and do ya in

into Dekes eyes with a mixture of hatred and trust
