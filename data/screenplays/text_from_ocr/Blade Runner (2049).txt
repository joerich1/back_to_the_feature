FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

FADE IN ON
A GREEN EYE
We move towards its pupil

EXT SKIES OVER GROUND DAY

SOARING OVER

AN INFINITE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE OF SOLAR PANELS AND PLASTIC
SHEETING All dead and abandoned to the dust and wind
Finally giving way to --

EXT FARMLAND CALIFORNIA DAY

Called farm only generously The ground dry inhospitable
A dubious horizon to distinguish the browns that are both
Earth and sky There is no green in sight

The landscape streaks by in a blur Nothing to tame our
focus until REVEAL

A SPINNER

Beaten scuffed yet owns the sky like a seagull It flits
RIGHT BY US as we MOVE INSIDE --

INT SPINNER

THE PILOT IS ASLEEP The Spinner on autopilot The MAP on
the dash is abruptly interrupted by A CHIME

The pilot wakes Yawns

This is K You’d peg him for 30 if you didn’t know better
Refined features flawless skin Intelligent eyes that
breathe in detail and exhale warmth Gifted with a grin that
masks wry for earnest

SHAPES begin to coalesce ahead in the distance Revealing
themselves to be PLASTIC GREENHOUSES

K’s eyes go hard at seeing a strange INSTALLATION ahead
K directs the Spinner towards

EXT FARMLAND CALIFORNIA DAY

TRAVELLING WITH THE SPINNER over remains of abandoned
greenhouses PLASTIC DOMES over what were once POOLS

A windmill stands above it all Slowly creakily rotating
Its bent wing hitting the center pole as it strikes 6
oclock creakCLACK creakCLACK creakCLACK

The Spinner’s SHADOW rolls over the windmill Approaching --

EXT FARMHOUSE DAY

Cement walls and corrugated tin roof An old school maybe
Beside it a PLASTIC TENTED POOL

INT TENTED POOL DAY

Under a translucent dome A bull of a FARMER stands knee
deep in a pool full of sludge raking a nutrient rich
solution Bio-reactors slowly filtered the fluid into
vertical plasmid sacs that feed into LARGE BINS

The Farmer wears thick protective gear from head to toe
Hood and goggles cover his face He takes up a handful of
NEMATODES pleased with his crop Looks up as --

THE SPINNER SOARS OVERHEAD

The Farmer sets down his rake

EXT FARMHOUSE

The Spinner lands in the open field behind the house kicking
up a PLUME of DUST that briefly obscures it

A small flitty HOVERCRAFT ejects itself from the back of the
Spinner A PILOTFISH

K emerges from the dust Whatever color his coat was it’s
brown now K instructs with the Pilotfish with a gesture It
TAKES OFF

K approaches the peeling-paint farmhouse ONE TREE in sight
a giant DEAD leafless thing A ghost of grandiosity
standing only thanks to a brace and wires staked down

INT FARMHOUSE MOMENTS LATER

K crosses creaking floors Looks around Kalsomined walls
pitted windows All old but clean Someone takes pride
Basic furniture an UPRIGHT PIANO Otherwise EMPTY No
decor shelves BARE

K inspects the few items Sheet music for CHOPIN on the
piano An aquarium in which COWSLIPS grow

A pot of something fragrant simmers on the stove K leans
into the pot sniffs deeply when --

HEAVY FOOTSTEPS come from outside Rattling the whole house

K re-lids the pot as --
EXT FARMHOUSE CONTINUOUS

The Farmer approaches his home Air HISSES in at the
unfastening of his MASK He eyes the Spinner parked beyond
the tree Sees the Pilotfish hovering above Pulls a chain
A DECONTAMINATION SHOWER rains over his suit which he can
now unsnap

This is SAPPER MORTON Weathered 60s A well-broken nose
Yet he pulls from his belt satchel a set of dainty glasses

INT FARMHOUSE CONTINUOUS

THE DOOR OPENS Sapper steps in The floor creaks under his
weight

He scans the room Empty Sapper moves to a sink where he
violently scrubs his hands He does not yet see K

K leans from a shadow into the light A stranger suddenly
visible Briefly ominous An uncertain moment

K
(polite)
Hope you don’t mind me taking the
liberty Wind’s a bit unkind out there
I was careful not to track in any dirt

Sapper eyes K’s chummy posture Dismisses any threat

SAPPER
I do not mind dirt I do mind
unannounced visits You police

K
Sapper Morton Civic number NK680514

SAPPER
I’m a farmer

K
(genuinely interested)
I saw that What do you farm

SAPPER
This is a protein farm Wallace design

Sapper fishes a clod off his boot and pulls off a single
wriggling WORM

SAPPER (cont’d)
It only takes the one to start
Parthenogenic strain Constant doubling
They’1l1 fill as much dirt as you can wet
K
Is that what I smell

K looks to that inviting pot on the stove Sapper shakes his
head pleased with himself Opens a cupboard where a grow
light nourishes PLANTS A few FLOWERS And a bottle
terrarium full of GREEN SHOOTS

SAPPER
Grow this just for me Garlic

K
Garlic

He looks The pot on the stove bubbles and steams

SAPPER
Whole town farmed it back once Smelled
this good a hundred miles in circle
Try some

K
No thank you I prefer to keep a cold
stomach until the hard part of the day’s
behind me How long you been here

SAPPER
Since ‘20 Came by it honest too if
that’s what you’re after

K
But you weren’t a farmer prior

Sapper cocks his head at the comment K notes the SATCHEL at
his belt

K (cont’d)
That bag colonial medical use isn’t
it Military issue Heat resistant
Where were you Calantha Must’ve
been brutal Not many who survived
bothered to come back to ground

A beat Sapper’s expression darkens He takes off his
glasses puts them in his satchel

SAPPER
Planning on taking me in Huh Take a
look inside See what they missed

REVEAL Sapper has A SCALPEL from his satchel Not likely
K

If taking you in is an option I’d much
prefer that over the alternative
K puts his gun on the table

K (cont’d)
You had to know it’d be someone in time
Sorry it’s me

K stands and retrieves a small SCANNER from his pocket

SAPPER
Good as any

K activates the scanner

K
If you’d look up and to the left please

The FIGHT is quick and it is fierce

Sapper stabs towards K’s heart kK avoids the blade only his
coat and the wall are pierced by Sapper’s knife now stuck
deep into the wall K breaks Sapper’s hold on the knife
which skids to the floor

K DUCKS a heavy fist that sinks into the wall where his head
just was Sapper grabs K by his belt and collar lifting him
into the air and slamming him into the wall over and over --
until K’s body GOES THROUGH IT and --

K crashes onto the floor in the next room

K recovers quickly strangely able to withstand the
punishment He sees Sapper charge through the wall to finish
the job

Sapper is on him -- a vice lock around K’s throat -- K
gasping for air

K gets out of Sapper’s grip and lashes out in rapid
succession his solar plexus his chin his throat crushing
his windpipe His blows are SURGICAL anatomically precise
like viper bites

Sapper is stunned choking in pain K kicks Sappers’ knee
and the giant drops to the floor like a felled oak tree

K SNATCHES Sapper’s THROAT -- SQUEEZING -- thumb SLIDING
UPWARD as -- Sapper GASPS FLAILS hand reaching

For the dropped SCALPEL GRASPING IT
HE STABS K in the SHOULDER

K accepts the wound and the pain Only squeezes tighter
Sapper’s EYES ROLL BACK -- the desired effect -- REVEALING
A PINPRICK OF COLOR on the underside of the right EYEBALL

K draws the SCANNER -- which reads the point like a bar code
It confirms Sapper’s ID

K stops holding back -- SNAPS Sapper’s remaining good arm --
grabs his GUN that has fallen on the floor beside the table

K (cont’d)
Please don’t get up

Sapper raises up still fighting for air

SAPPER
How does it feel killing your own kind

K
I don’t retire my own kind We don’t
run Only old models run

SAPPER
You new models You’re happy scraping
the shit You’ve never seen a miracle

Sapper gives a zealot’s grin Ready to die for a cause only
he understands Eager for it HE RUSHES K

THE GUN THUNDERS
HOLD ON THE GUN So we only HEAR Sapper’s body DROP

K breathes heavy Checks his wound Sees his BLOOD on his
FINGERS

Blood trickles onto fallen sheet music Staining Chopin

K smooths himself back to dignity Leans over the body
Then PAUSES Crosses the room Finds a spoon Hesitates

Tastes the soup Hmmm Garlic

EXT FARMHOUSE MOMENTS LATER

K steps out Looks up at a sliver of sun eking through the
dense clouds The Pilotfish is hovering above the farm

In one hand he holds SAPPER’S GLASSES In the other he holds
a small clear CASE INSIDE IS SAPPER’S EYE He staggers
toward his Spinner Gestures to the Pilotfish

K
Photograph everything

The Pilotfish rises to take pictures of the farm
INT SPINNER
K taps a button on the dash An LAPD LOGO comes up

K
Madam please

ON SCREEN comes the perpetually disappointed face of LT
JOSHI A 50ish woman Ambitious officious impatient K’s
backtalk gives fuel to her irritation so she tolerates it

Or maybe she just likes the look of him More than she
should She sees his BLOODY shoulder

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
You’re hurt I’m not paying for that

K
I’1l glue it

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
And

In answer K holds up the CASE with SAPPER’S EYE The
pinprick of his CODE below the cornea It SCANS Sapper’s
SERIAL NUMBER and history open A NEXUS 8 for the curious

JOSHI (ON SCREEN) (contd)
One of the tail end Nexus 8s before
Prohibition Looks like he could take
your head off

K
He thought about it

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
Field medic standard ocular ID upgrades
open end lifespan now ended He went
AWOL after Calantha with a few more in
his outfit I wouldn’t mind closing out
Just him

MORE NEXUS 8 IDs flit by All wanting to be retired

K
Just the one

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
Between the retirement and the bleed
you’ll see a tidy bonus Less mine

K
Can I get it today
JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
I don’t know what you all do with cash in
pocket anyway Come on home for your
baseline

Something catches K’s eye By that TREE Low to the ground
The smallest pop of YELLOW against a dirt brown world

K
Moment Madam

EXT FARMHOUSE
He kneels at the foot of the tree to find
A SINGLE SLENDER COWSLIP Left leaning against a root

K lifts it to his eye As if moved by its delicacy He
considers the long dead tree Gestures to the Pilotfish --

K
There 30 meters to maximum depth

The Pilotfish begins a spiral over the area
ON THE SCREEN An ULTRASOUND of the ground below Root

systems A cracked foundation And there buried DEEP under
the tree A SMALL SEALED SQUARE FOOTLOCKER

Joshi sees it in her office as well Annoyed at more work

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
What is that

K
It’s down in deep Send a dig team
Madam

Joshi SIGHS annoyed

K (cont’d)
Should I find a shovel spare your night

JOSHI (ON SCREEN)
(yes but)
You better get back ahead of the storm
The Pilotfish attaches itself to the spinner as it takes off

Camera moves toward the tree as we --

CUT TO
EXT SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES NIGHT

LIGHTNING shatters the sky into irregular jigsaw shapes
Indeed there is a storm collecting to the north We are

SOARING OVER

The breathtaking cityscape skyline of dystopian grime 30
years older Sweatier Sucked of oxygen If LA then was a
giant oil refinery then now it is industrial bones jutting
out of a new city built atop the old And spread far as the
eye can see What were streets are canyons that cut deep
down to the strata below Who knows how far

KS SPINNER

Is a single bulb in the Christmas tree Part of the SPINNER
TRAFFIC that lights up the sky Now gliding for the city’s
poorer uglier center A seizure of ADVERTISEMENT
interactive and bright In the distance is a massive
structure THE SEPULVEDA SEAWALL

INTERVIEWER (0S)
Subject Officer K D6-dash-3-dot-7
Let’s begin Ready

K (0S)
Yes Sir

INTERVIEWER (0S)
Recite your baseline

We see K through his rain streaked windshield as the Spinner
banks and begins its descent toward a grey cinder block of a
building RUNNING LIGHTS illuminate a LANDING PAD at the top
of the LAPD TOWER DIVISION 5

K (0S)

“And blood-black nothingness began to
spin A system of cells interlinked
within Cells interlinked within cells
interlinked Within one stem”

INT POLICE STATION PROCESSING HALL NIGHT

Lifeless architecture Huge with worn out plastic features
Call it functional to be nice

Though it is late it is CROWDED Bloody-nosed K walks
through a chaotic hive of crime processing CRIMINALS
pleading cases at plexi-covered booths or shouting into
payport phone banks

The HUMAN COPS still manage to get in K’s way sure to remind
him of his place and esteem as a Replicant

COP
Fuck off Skinjob
If that bothers K he does not let on
K (0S)
“And dreadfully distinct Against the
dark a tall white fountain played”

INT INTERVIEW ROOM DAY

A clinical room that was white a decade ago maybe The
INTERVIEWER can be heard but not seen

The long barrelled LENS of a specialized CAMERA slides back
and forth to find its specific focus on K who sits ona
stool Coat off and on his lap Dry blood on his cut shirt
He stares ahead at the camera Compliant and still

CUT TO

EXT CITY STREET

A POLICE SPINNER glides low overhead A small ADVERTISEMENT
DRONE hovers like an insect projecting 3D ads in the smoggy
atmosphere A HUGE SNOW MELTING MACHINE moves down the
street clearing the slush It passes to REVEAL --

K He pushes past the occlusion of PEOPLE buttoned against
the cold Crosses the windblown street Gutters heaped with
dirty snow as more dirty snow falls Fat sooty flakes

He carries a newly purchased PACKAGE under his arm

EXT K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX

A grand old office building TILT DOWN the building’s
facade as K enters

INT K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX

The office building has been hastily and cheaply retrofitted
for residential living DENSELY crowded with FAMILY LIFE

The many RESIDENTS too poor or genetically problematic to
get Off-World treat the halls and stairway landings like a
dorm commons An extension of their own homes

Pungent signs of ethnicity everywhere Colors carpets
clothes As many languages as shades of skin K gives a nod
of acknowledgment to a man smoking in the hall Is
acknowledged back with a stream of foreign epithets that
follow him up

INT K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX

FIND K ON THE STAIRS

Walking up 80 stories Stiff from the fight An OLD WOMAN
bumps into him expecting him to get out of her way No one
he passes the least glad to see a Replicant

INT HALLWAY

K crosses the hall ALL his NEIGHBORS’ DOORS are open like
market stalls letting in air and letting out CHILDREN Every
home thickly filled like a hoarder’s garage Some host
SHOPS FOOD STALLS Every floor like a town square

K walks past and to his apartment A BOY brown-faced
missing an ear looking up at K with curiosity and fear

K opens the lock Disappears inside The only one to close
his door which is tagged with a GRAFFITI “FUCK OFF
SKINNER”

EXT K’S APARTMENT NIGHT

PUSH IN ON K’S WINDOW as a LIGHT turns on within

INT K’S APARTMENT

A sparsely adorned space in clear contrast to his neighbors
No pretense of cultural heritage A simple chair On its
arm a valueless paperback novel well-thumbed noted
creased Nabokov’s maddening “PALE FIRE” as it happens not
that we make a thing of it

K walks in with his package trying to be discreet he hides
it as

He turns on a CONSOLE Perhaps a MUSIC PLAYER which spins a
SINATRA song “Summer Winds”

K takes off his coat Seems more annoyed at the scalpel tear
in the fabric than the shoulder wound he sustained under it

WOMAN’S VOICE (0S)
K I didn’t hear you You’re early

K
You want me to come back
JOI (0S)
(a laugh)

Go scrub

Just hearing it helps take away the pain K relaxes into
this normal domestic scene

INT SHOWER

K washes off the day’s dust and blood Jets shower Five
seconds of water

INT BATHROOM
K at a mirror eyes his shoulder WOUND

JOI (0S)
How was your meeting

He squeezes the contents of a thin nosed TUBE onto it
Platelet jelly The skin rebonds Gluing it after all

K
The usual How was your day

JOI I’m getting cabin fever

INT KITCHEN

K cooks in a corridor kitchen that looks like one we would
find in a very old space station He cooks with dexterity
trying to be light as he makes a prefab meal

K
I had an accident at work Think I
ruined my shirt

JOI (0S)
I’m sure I can fix that for you Let me
take a look at it

K
You want a drink first I need a drink

JOI (0OS)
Mmm-hmm Pour me one will you

INT K’S APARTMENT

K crosses in pours two drinks Sits on a chair in the
middle of the living room Neighbors at the window a
couple on the other side of the street Ordinary life

JOI (0S8)
I’m trying a new recipe I think you’1l
like it

K

Don’t fuss

JOI Too late I hope it isn’t dry

K plays at indignation but is glad for her thoughtfulness
Ks life is not lonely and that is something in this world

K drinks the two drinks poured sits to eat the meal he made

JOI (0S) (contd)
Did you know this song was released in
1966 on Reprise Records It was number 1
on the charts Won’t be much longer
Finishing touches

He opens a CASE Inside Five cigarettes A commodity He
sets ONE onto an ashtray

We hear CUTLERY gather We hear FOOTSTEPS

JOI (contd)
Ok ready I think you’ll like it

K
I told you not to fuss

JOI (0OS)
And yet

REVEAL JOI

Not a real woman at all A digital companion PROJECTED from
a hard line CONSOLE unit mounted on tracks along the ceiling
and restricting her existence to this space Goddess
girlfriend geisha and right now goddamn bombshell
Ingeniously real in every way except the one that counts

She holds a plate of steak frites Not real of course An

illusion of satisfaction Just like Joi in her APRON over a
sweater set and pearls Waiting for him with dinner on the

table and drink in hand like a cartoon 60s housewife

(NOTE Joi cannot interact with physical objects Any
“object” she manipulates is a holo representation like her
Nor does she move when unobserved by K when he turns away
for any length of time she shifts into idle animations )

JOI (contd)
Voila Bon appetit

She sets the plate atop his sad prefab bowl of actual food
Kisses him on the cheek

CLOSE ON HIS SKIN Brushed by the butterfly kiss of her
cloud Palpable but not tangible

JOI (cont’d)
I missed you babysweet

K
Honey it’s beautiful

JOI
Just put your feet up Relax

K is moved by the gesture He puts the cigarette to his
lips Joi leans in close Puts up a finger Juuuust
teasingly touching the tip of the cigarette until a
tiny STATIC SPARK ignites an ember

He draws and his cigarette lights He blows the smoke into
Joi making her hologram all the more dense and real

They look at each other Joi studies him She looks to the
shelf Notes Sapper’s glasses

JOI (cont’d)
Was a day huh

K
(heavy)
It was a day

Her form seamlessly reverts back to her lissome baseline
Companionate respectable smart The way he likes her She
“picks up” his copy of “Pale Fire” hoping to cheer him up

JOI
Would you read to me I’m dying to know
what happens next

K
You hate that book

K smiles She throws the book behind her back The book
disappears as it flies

JOI
I don’t want to read either Let’s
dance

She straightens Arm up to receive his and be led wearing
now a beautiful dress And with that Joi wins K has no
choice but to put his day behind him

JOI (cont’d)
You wanna dance or you wanna open your
present

JOI (cont’d)
A present

Joi looks elated

JOI (cont’d)
What’s the occasion

K
Our anniversary

JOI
Is it

K smiles Of course not

He opens the box on A DIGITAL DEVICE size of a King Size
Snickers Joi visibly brightens with excitement

K
Happy Anniversary

JOI
An emanator

K
We don’t need a hard line anymore Try
it on

K presses the console Joi hesitates only a moment then
FADES AWAY

A RESTART CHIME A LOGO floats off the emanator A SPHERE
surrounded by smaller spheres in orbit WALLACE CORP EandC

K taps the emanator and with a CHIME Joi comes back
online THE EMANATOR conjures her even more realistically in
every way She moves about her image unbroken as it was
when projected from the hard line She TWIRLS about the
pleats in the new dress conjured for the effect billow out
She loves it

JOI
Oh thank you thank you thank you

K
You can go anywhere in the world What
do you want to see first

Joi considers eyes sparkling with an idea And we

EXT ROOFTOP STORMING NIGHT

ON JOI Rapt eyes fixed on the gorgeous fractal skyline
The rain passes through her projection In a well-programmed
nod to physics her clothes get “wet” stick to her skin

LIGHTNING FIRES ABOVE Joi does not flinch Only flickers
K raises his coat to cover the rain Joi stays his hand

JOI
Stay like this The light catches your
skin You look like me If you’re not
too cold

He’s not Stays wet

JOI (cont’d)
I’m so happy when I’m with you

K
You don’t have to say that

Joi “takes” his hand Static heightened by the conductive
water clinging to his skin She leads his hand to her waist
As if to dance

She leans in close to his neck Her exhaled “breath” tickles
his lips A smoky wet dream He kisses her She looks deep
in his eyes K kisses her neck slowly not breaking the
illusion The moment intensifies-- her breath escaping --

HER IMAGE GOES STATIC --

THEN FREEZES -- her face in a rictus of ecstacy gorgeous in
motion but the single frame out of context appears vulgar

Jois face replaced by AN EMERGENCY PAGE “VOICE MESSAGE
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE REQUIRED” The POLICE LOGO His time is
entirely owned The message plays

JOSHI (VO)
Your dig came through Get down here

K looks at Joi their moment ruined A chime from the
emanator and she is gone

INT MORGUE POLICE STATION MOMENTS LATER

ON A MACHINE MOVING OVER A SKELETON ON AN EXAMINATION
TABLE Bones clean Half assembled half still in a 2X2xX2
footlocker A thick BRAID of HAIR CURLED beside it An
AUTOPSY is visible taking place in an adjacent room as --

A TECHNICIAN takes out the remaining bones one by one and
unwraps them -- as each has been individually wrapped in
cotton rags with ritualistic care A small bag contains the
full set of teeth which the Technician sets under a scanner

A pug COP NANDEZ enjoys the show A bigot with a mouth
certain whatever comes out of it is funny Recognizable as
human as all humans stuck on Earth seem to be

NANDEZ
Your box is a military footlocker issued
to Sapper Morton creatively repurposed
as an ossuary Box of bones
meticulously cleaned and laid to rest
about 30 years gone Nothing else in it

Coco
No breaks hi K no signs of trauma

The PELVIS centers A FRACTURE Similar pattern to the heat
lighting K ignores the holo checks the actual bones as --

Coco (cont’d)
Fracture through the ilium Narrow birth
canal baby probably got stuck The bone
should re-bond if you live long enough
she didn’t

JOSHI
She was pregnant

K
So he didn’t kill her

Coco
She died in childbirth Guess she wasn’t
meant for motherhood

K continues looking at the bones after Coco moves on dHe
sees something on the pelvis Throws it upscreen Enlarges
the image until SCRAPES ALONG THE BONE are visible Taps it

K
Go back Closer Closer That What’s
that

COCO

Notching on the iliac crest Fine point
like a scalpel Looks like an emergency
c-section Cuts are clean No sign of
struggle

K
He was a combat medic Maybe he tried to
save her Just didn’t

Joshi considers Eye to Coco Is he right
Coco checks the image Whistles goofily impressed

NANDEZ
He didn’t seem like the saving type

COCO
He took the time to bury her A
sentimental skinjob
(off K realizes the insult)
Sorry

JOSHI
Didn’t seem the Daddy type either So
where’s the kid You scan the whole
field

NANDEZ
Just dirt and worms No other bodies

Coco
Maybe he ate it

K steps away Picks up the thick BRAID Considers it
Looks at the COWSLIP in an evidence bag Stares at it

He lifts the bone The fractured ilium Instinct engaged
again He puts it back upscreen

WE CLOSE IN further and further on the sample Down to
cellular level A FORM coming into focus

ON K AS HE SEES IT EXPRESSION CHANGING

K motions for Joshi to look She sees his face looks Beat

ON JOSHI As we see what she does on the SCREEN

LETTERS AND NUMBERS ETCHED ON A CELL A SERIAL NUMBER

K and Joshi look at each other facing incontrovertible truth

INT JOSHI’S OFFICE MOMENTS LATER

Evercalm Joshi pours herself a drink A safeguard on that
calm She picks up her drink with a shaking hand Finally --

JOSHI
Thats not possible She was -- a
Replicant Pregnant It was pregnant

She quiets with the alcohol burn

Stares out Seeing too many steps ahead Into darkness
She sets her glass down with finality Finally looks to K
firm declaring

JOSHI (contd)
(firm)
The world’s built on a wall that
separates kind Tell either side there’s

no wall -- you bought a war -- or a
slaughter
(and then)

So what you saw Didn’t Happen

K
Yes Madam

JOSHI
What isn’t possible can’t be

K
Yes Madam

JOSHI
There’s an order to things This turns

Like a meditation garden Or a temple A dim room lit by
spears of artificial sunlight A great fish-filled POND owns

Luv steps over the stone path across the pond to the far end
by an arrangement of decadent chairs There is a nervous
clip to her voice
LUV

You wanted to review the new model Sir

Before shipment The remote telomerics

implemented for home renewal
A VOICE ECHOES in reply coming from everywhere

NIANDER WALLACE (0S)
Do you come bearing gifts

Luv pauses Asked what she hoped would not be

LUV
Not yet Sir

A little black drone like a BARRACUDA moves from the darkness
towards Luv

NIANDER WALLACE (0S)

An Angel should never enter the hut

without a gift Or news Can you at

least pronounce a child is born
Luv stops says nothing Hating to disappoint him
A pause Then the Barracuda moves past Luv It joins
A SMALL CLUSTER of BARRACUDAS that float toward Luv in the
LIT center of the room They undulate in watery formation at
eye level like Medusa would ask of her snakes to precede --
NIANDER WALLACE
Shadow shrouded Commanding in his silences which are few
Older yet at the height of powers that still increase as if
by magic Only when he steps into the LIGHT do we see --

INT CRECHE

A dark room dominated by a cascading PLASTIC SHEET The
sheeting rises slowly to unveil --

A NUDE FEMALE REPLICANT Fully formed Suspended in repose
Covered in viscous liquid like honey

The Replicant collapses to the ground

Something happens when she is exposed to the cold air She
WAKES AN INCEPT

A first breath Consciousness coming on anew A first
flutter of the eyes A slow realization of light Of cold

OF WALLACE STARING AT HER

Wallace’s hand touches her face Turns it Caresses it
“Seeing” her with his fingers

The Replicant Model bristles in mute terror of a world she
cannot understand Shivering Cold and fear commingled

NIANDER WALLACE
The first thought tends to fear To
preserve the clay Fascinating Before
we even know what we are we fear to lose
it Happy birthday

Wallace now sits on a small Japanese stool cleaning his
hands with a cloth

The new Replicant sits in front of him wrapped in a sheet

A BLADE

Luv holds back Knows better than to help without asked as
he begins his examination

NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
Bring the one for micronics would you
luv

Ah “luv” A diminutive Not a name at all though taken
for one Luv brings a small wooden box INSIDE THE box are
several small DEVICES the size of LEGO bricks HALOS Each
with electrodes on the inside Luv selects one of them

She comes with the HALO -- which attaches with a practiced
motion neatly into a FLASH SHOE on the back of Wallace’s head
at the lambdoidal suture

The electrodes fit into wetware receivers within and the
device glows to match the new light in the Barracudas’ eyes
enabled

Luv’s hands shake as she closes the box Beyond respect she
lives in perpetual awe of him

A formation of BARRACUDAS come around Wallace Then moves
toward the Replicant model predatorily

Now look I brought back the Angels and
took us to nine new worlds
(disdainful)
Nine A child can count to nine on
fingers We should own the stars

LUV
Yes Sir

Wallace stands walks toward the Model

NIANDER WALLACE
We were meant to reach beyond the
firmament We should read our books by
the light of a thousand different stars
Every one a home Till we lose count
That’s the future of the species if
there’s to be one We simply need more
Angels to carry us aloft

LUV
Sir

He runs the SCALPEL’S dull edge under the Model’s CHIN to
raise it Stills her when she again shivers

NIANDER WALLACE
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce We
lost our stomach for slaves Unless
engineered And I can only make so many

He runs the dull edge along the entire length of the Model

NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
To make this I have to build from whole
cloth Bit by bit and at great expense
Shameful inefficiency built into
Tyrell’s template Tyrell

He touches the Model’s abdomen at the navel

NIANDER WALLACE (contd)
That barren pasture empty and salted
Right there The dead space between the
stars This the seat that we must change
for Heav’n

With a swift motion he CUTS the Model across the ABDOMEN
She stands for an uneasy moment as he continues

NIANDER WALLACE (contd)
I cannot breed them I have tried so
help me Tyrell’s final puzzle in
adamantine chains and penal Fire

He drops the scalpel

NIANDER WALLACE (contd)
We need more Replicants than can ever be
assembled Millions so we can be
trillions More Worlds beyond worlds

retake her

Perfected then lost There is a

Our landfills expanded to become part of the geography

Tacky and textured Trodden vermiculated paths up and down

FROM TRASH ARTFULLY RE-CRAFTED INTO NECESSITIES FURNITURE

DOZENS of pale ratty ORPHANS sit on the floor Eating their
meal out of bowls in fearful silence Some have obvious
deformities Others just ill or odd from a life in darkness

Seeing K the CHILDREN stop still Eyes wide and astonished
If they’ve ever seen anyone like him it wasn’t lately

They circle K like he was a newfound species Fascinated
All wanting to poke at him touch his clothes

AN ORPHAN BOY TAKES K’S HAND Begins to lead him through

They pass A GIRL curled up with a handcrafted DOLL its
“skin” made of scales fashioned from flattened soda cans

A SHRILL WHISTLE BLASTS from far off The children all
return to their seats on the floor

The Orphan Boy stiffens Scared Points ahead For K to go
on alone K nods his thanks and enters

Capped by the overturned DISH sections of which have been
cut to let in the light Like an AMPHITHEATER Thick
support beams built of reclaimed metals All to house --

shoulders and powerful arms He SHOUTS at the children

K follows Cotton through a dense section of WORKING COUGHING
CHILDREN

MISTER COTTON
No child in my care is ever cold is ever
hungry -- clothes blankets Food not
the tastiest but warm and enough I
encourage play keeps them occupied
makes them nimble But it’s work that
molds them into a child worth having

A TRAY of bottles spills Cotton suddenly blows A SHRILL
WHISTLE that hangs from a chain around his neck The BOYS
FREEZE their work Cotton stares them down The Boys’ faces
lower in fear and shame Begin to clean their mistake

They move through an area dedicated to the sorting of METALS
Taken from old technology Sorted and melted down by MUCH
YOUNGER CHILDREN Many of whom show the desquamated skin and
blackened teeth of metal poisoning

MISTER COTTON (contd)
We find new life for everything
discarded And every one The nickel
goes to colonial ships Closest any of
them will get to the grand life offworld
Now -- what sort did you have in mind I
have all kinds

He blows two short BLASTS of his WHISTLE Every child in the
arena instantly STOPS WORK STANDS FACES THEM On display

K sees the sea of hopeful faces Shows his BADGE

K
I’m not buying

Cotton wheels on K Suddenly hackles up and hard boiled

MISTER COTTON
No This is my game and I play it fair
Bigger have tried to shut me down men at

K gives a hard stare Taking in all the KIDS

K
A little boy came through here 30 years
back I need to see your records
Legitimate placements private sales
Everything in and out

MISTER COTTON
I don’t keep records that far back

K
You don’t

MISTER COTTON
I can’t help you

Cotton gives a confident supercilious shrug In response

K CRACKS Cotton in the FACE SLAMS him to a wall PULLS his
WHISTLE CHAIN tight Choking him In front of THE CHILDREN

K
I think you can I think someone like
you keeps a long memory Minds what he
owes and makes sure he gets paid

You can tell me what you know or I put

stratospheric IQ with eyes that do not hide it
Conspicuously lovely for a human not offworld

wand onto moving canvas Spinning and MOLDING and moving the
images with a palmed INSTRUMENT As much electronic as
musical Somewhere between performance art and programming

I was wondering

ANA
Why I’m not offworld My parents had our
passes in pocket then I took sick It
was a new life or me they picked me
Made my cage and filled it with
everything they could to keep me happy --
except company of course and I was used
to crowds What can I help you with

Caught But not minding it K tries direct

K
Just questions You might be able to
help me with a case

Ana considers amused by the idea

That is the most interesting thing I’ve
been offered to help with in ages Do
you mind if I work while you talk I
promise I hear every word

creates a birthday cake focuses on the candles She “puts”

She adjusts the ICING on the cake Then brings in SMILING
FACES OF CHILDREN Taking special care to craft the micro-
expressions on each face joy wonder anticipation

She takes the edges of the IMAGE out of focus adding Holga
like blurs and imperfections

He offered to buy me out I take my
freedom where I can find it

K
What makes your memories so authentic

ANA

I was locked in an aseptic cloister at
eight If I wanted to see the world I
had to imagine it I got very good at
imagining Wallace needs my talent to
maintain a stable product “Provide
context for unavoidable affect” I think
it’s only kind

(with sympathy )

ANA (contd)
Replicants live such hard lives made to
do what we’d rather not I can’t help
your future but I can give you good
memories to think back on and smile A

HAND to reach out to the cake fingers thick with stolen
FROSTING which is brought towards us in POV to taste a
tiny complete evocative birthday memory vignette

She steps back to consider it Pleased with her work

K
Nice

ANA
It’s better than nice It feel
authentic If you have authentic
memories you’ll have real human
responses wouldn’t you agree

Ana and the kids blow out the candles together and the room
goes completely dark

K
Are all the memories constructed or do
you ever use ones that are real

ANA
It’s illegal to use real memories But
there’s bit of every artist in their
work

K
How can you tell the difference Can you
tell if a memory really happened

Lights turn on as Ana walks towards K At this Ana faces
him Her favorite subject merits her full attention

ANA
Untangling memory and history They all
think it’s about more detail dutiful
exactitude hyberbolic photorealism --
that’s not how the memory works We
recall with our feelings and our
feelings are awful students The mind is
an impressionist Anything real should
be a mess I can show you

Only if you fight it So maybe don’t
fight it

on her side of the divide She looks into the scanner

K puts his face into the rest A light SHINES bright into
his eyes

Now think about the memory you want me to
see Not even that hard Just picture

ON MARIETTE Her eyes snap open Also awake She slowly
gets out of bed and dresses

As she dresses she scans the room Sees the suitcase again
Touches K’s PHOTOS on the coffee table Then --

She discreetly tags an almost imperceptible device in one of
K’s jacket’s pockets

With that she begins to move toward the door when she sees --

THE WOODEN HORSE Her eyes widen She moves to it Picks
it up reverentially Moved by it

MARIETTE
From a tree

Then sees --
JOI Simply standing there Watching her Eerie stillness

JOI
I’m done with you You can go

Mariette sets the horse back Puts on her coat Stares
right back Refusing to see Joi as more Mocking Back on
her hard mode

MARIETTE
“Quiet now” I’ve been inside you Not
so much there as you think
And she’s out the door

As we CLOSE IN ON JOI a flinch a feeling

But K’s attention is on the WOODEN HORSE Mariette’s words
lingering He feels it in his fingers

K
From a tree

Joi catches on to his idea Brightening with the insight
Confirming his thought

JOI
Your story isn’t over yet

There’s still a page left Written with
love

only a shell of debauchery The hulked MEGASTRUCTURES are

In their day they were fever dreams of debauchery Decades

What is it

Ks look isn’t reassuring

K
We’1l find out

ON K Decision made He gets out of his vehicle parked on
the side of a hill Down below few miles away we see the
ruins of a city lying under a cloud of red dust

He begins to walk

An old warning panel beaten by the wind WARNING RADIATION
LEVELS INHOSPITABLE can be seen nearby

LOOKING OVER THE SPINNER We see K recede into the
distance Moving toward the city

EXT STATUARY COURTYARD AFTERNOON

People once gathered here to take photos and frolic All
under the eyes of the god-sized STATUES towering above
Erotically posed and positioned Gods making gods Now in
semi-ruins beheaded and disarmed

K is a human speck at their feet Dwarfed Stepping over
cracked and uneven concrete

A plume of red dust beats against K

The wind finally passes But when it does K’s eyes LOCK on
something overhead that astounds him so much more than the
grand ghost city Something small

A BEE

Flitting about It waggles a crooked path to land

ON HIS ARM

K is speechless He has never seen the like He is careful
not to move lest he scare it off

The bee takes off anyway Flies a deliberate line through
the grand statue’s legs K follows after it as The BEE
joins another MORE BEES STILL Until the loose cluster
rejoins

A SWARM OF THOUSANDS THIS was the dark cloud he saw from
afar They move as one Their HUMS together a ROAR
Circling in waves around an ARTIFICIAL FEEDING SYSTEM

K steps below the vertical FEEDER Powered by a solar panel
that has recently been SLEEVE-SWIPED clean of dust

K TURNS HEARING SOMETHING MELDED WITH THE WIND MUSIC

He strains to listen The faintest sound of A PIANO

He raises his eyes toward the source of the sound If it is
real at all it seems to come from

A CLASSIC OLD STYLE CASINO HOTEL

Faded deep cracks in its foundation the occasional window
blown out But still an architectural wonder

EXT CASINO HOTEL

K crosses the lake-sized FOUNTAIN long dry and cracked

INT CASINO LOBBY AFTERNOON

K enters great glass double doors reinforced with steel
Sand piled at the seams K takes a single step and stops
short at --

Seemingly nothing Then we make out what his eyes perceived
A set of thin carefully hidden TRIPWIRES across the floor

He carefully steps over

He continues in The lobby is long abandoned A chandelier
long since crashed to the lobby floor

K WALKS THROUGH Dust motes swirl in the stale air
K passes a MANNEQUIN dressed as a bellman

He SPINS hearing MOVEMENT Seeing no one And then HE
HEARS A PIANO THREE NOTES PLAYED somewhere deep inside

INT CORRIDOR
He moves into the dark Following another NOTE’S ECHO

INT CASINO FLOOR

A huge gambling hall A bar Behind which is AN ELABORATE
PYRAMID SCULPTURE made of EMPTY ALCOHOL BOTTLES Someone has
been here Lived and drank here

K passes old poker tables CARDS fanned out on a blackjack
table Dust on the felt He picks up a card

He walks on Toward the sound MOVES UP A SET OF STAIRS

INT CIRCULAR BAR

A balcony on the third floor MEZZANINE STACKS of priceless
paintings against the bar There K finds --

A PIANO

The keys open K taps a KEY The note rings through the
airy space Makes the current of floating dust vibrate At
which K notices --

TWO EYES staring at him in the dark --
A MANGY DOG

It is at a glance the ugliest dog on earth Flea bitten
and ragged But a real live dog It cocks its head at K

ON K Utterly awed by this animal Homely as it is it is
miraculous to him He moves slowly toward it Hand out
Hoping to touch it So lost in the discovery he is
completely surprised by -- THE CLICK OF A GUN --

MANS VOICE (0S)
“You mightn’t happen to have a piece of
cheese about you now boy”

DECKARD’S ICONIC BLASTER
Comes out of the SHADOWS half into the LIGHT Preceding
RICK DECKARD

Strong tireless Seasoned by time and like teak or copper
far more handsome for the patina But also something
cracky about him Thoughts obscure running together

Enough to keep us guessing if he’s gone touched left alone
out here too long Or maybe just a calculated way to keep
an intruder guessing

K stares down the blaster Takes a gamble

K
“Treasure Island”

DECKARD
He reads That’s good Me too Not
much else to do around here at night
anymore “Many’s the night I’ve dreamed

Something about it alters his fragile mood Suddenly no
longer in the mood for pain

Is it the same now as then The moment
you met her All these years you looked
back on that day drunk on the memory of
its perfection how shiny her lips
how instant your connection

(MORE )

NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
Did it never occur to you that was why
you were summoned in the first place
Designed to do nothing short of fall for
her right then and there All to make
that single perfect specimen

THE HOLO PLAYBACK OF DECKARD AND RACHAEL FREEZES DISSIPATES

Deckard seethes Fights the insidious logic To his last
breath which may be soon he won’t accept the possibility or
its implications

NIANDER WALLACE (contd)
That is if you were designed Love
or mathematical precision Yes
No You are a window to me

The question lingers What everyone wants to know Except
one man

DECKARD
I know what’s real

Wallace laughs

NIANDER WALLACE
Very clever to keep yourself empty of
information And all it cost you was
everything But You can still help me
I can see -- deliberate spaces in your
mind engrammic lacunae faces blocked
You had help in the hiding Where did
they go You know something Help me
and good things can come to you

DECKARD
You don’t have children do you

NIANDER WALLACE
I have millions

Deckard shakes his head Laughs

NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
You think I’ve nothing to offer but pain
Only you love pain Pain reminds you the
joy you felt was real Good Yes More
joy then

Wallace gestures to Luv Who comes around behind Deckard

At which Deckard hears HEELS on the floor Footsteps
coming

NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
Do not be afraid

A WOMAN steps across the path over the water The woman
steps into the light Deckard sees

RACHAEL

Precisely as when he met her As she was in the holo Down
to the lashes Flesh and blood Young again Remade
Authentic Inauthentic

ON DECKARD Breath gone Wallace presents his offer

NIANDER WALLACE (cont’d)
An Angel Made again For you

Deckard fights the urge can’t help but look A perfect
recreation of all he ever wanted is right in front of him
In the flesh Instantly filled with longing With disgust

Rachael steps close to Deckard Lifts his chin So they are
face to face We are transported back decades in seconds

RACHAEL
Did you miss me

Deckard says nothing

RACHAEL (contd)
Don’t you love me

The mirage utterly real and convincing Deckard strains
against pain of loss Strains not to lose himself in a
memory of lost joy We fear he is tempted when --

He tears his face from her hand Rejecting the simulacrum

DECKARD
Her eyes were green

And he walks away from her standing now at the edge of the
darkness

ON WALLACE Cold Nods to Luv Luv understands

ON DECKARD Behind him Luv raises her gun and shoots
Rachael straight in the head Deckard startles Rachael
falls brutally on the floor The gunshot echoes forever

ON Deckard He stares at Wallace a murder

ON WALLACE

NIANDER WALLACE
Offworld I have everything I need to make
you talk You don’t know what pain is
yet You will learn
Luv grins -- dark work she will enjoy and --
CUT TO

INT ABANDONED BASEMENT NIGHT

ON K HE STARTLES AWAKE HIS EYES SCAN AROUND IN FEAR GO
WIDE WITH SUDDEN RECOGNITION OF INTENSE PAIN

He is in a dark high ceilinged space Eerily devoid of the
bustle we’ve seen in other abandoned spaces Just the quiet
drip of efflorescent laden water weeping through concrete

He is sweating Shaking with the fever of deep set
infection His broken body manages to respond as he forces
it to rise

He looks to his CLENCHED FIST Opens it He clasps a broken
shard of the emanator All that’s left of Joi Shining
plastic reflecting firelight He hears WHISPERS MOVEMENT --

A SET OF REFLECTIVE EYES PEER AT K IN THE DARK MARIETTE
THE 2 DOXIES FROM THE BAR AND DECKARD’S MANGY DOG STILL
BESIDE HER

Mariette looks to K with new feeling Trusting Wanting him
to trust her She stands aside to REVEAL --

MARIETTE’S HANDLER FROM THE BAR

She walks toward K She wears the same DARK GLASSES even
here In the dark

This is FREYSA

She speaks with the calm heavenbound confidence of the eerily
devout The unique patois of a colony we will never visit

FREYSA
You must want I look up and to the left

She lifts up her dark glasses to REVEAL HER RIGHT EYE SOCKET
IS EMPTY

FREYSA (cont’d)
Runners heeling me a long time for this
Make a fine bit of bonus would my eye
would it weren’t a long long gone

Only now can we recognize her as the SAME WOMAN who was in
the old PHOTO of a woman holding a child by the TREE

K
I know you

MARIETTE
This is Freysa She fought with Sapper
on Calantha

K cocks his head at her seeing the pieces fit Water drips
somewhere near

K
You were there At Sapper’s farm You
helped them hide the child

Freysa beams beatific and moved Looks down at her arms

FREYSA
Ohhhh I was there I saw a miracle
delivered Held a pinchy perfect face
crying up at me mad as thunder

She takes the PHOTO Looks at it She and the child She
circles K as she tells it Telling it like legend

FREYSA (cont’d)
I knew it all changes now The first
drop of rain Something to die for

K understands he’s talking to the only living witness to his
own birth Wants to know -- everything

K
Where you with her Rachael When the
baby came

FREYSA

(nods )
I saw baby come I held Mama as she die
She die good She die feeling it Daddy
already flew gone before he could see
leaving a puzzle behind We each hide a
piece so no one mind ever know enough to
make the map Daddy least of all Why
Sapper let you kill him keep his piece

(off K enthralled)
Deckard wanted it keep quiet I fail him
on that Told anyone with ears to hear
Of a baby come from one of us Some
listen too

More FOOTSTEPS come toward them

FREYSA (contd)
That baby meant we was more than
creations We was creation More than
just slaves If a baby can come from one
of us we are our own masters

MARIETTE
“More human than humans”

K
What about Deckard They’1ll kill him

FREYSA
He don’t matter

Freysa takes K’s gun DECKARDS BLASTER She presses the
barrel to her own chest Presses his hand over the trigger

FREYSA (cont’d)
Deckard Sapper me you our lives
nothing next to a storm coming

As if set free by her acknowledgement the shadows suddenly
SPARKLE with glinting REFLECTIVE RETINAE DOZENS OF EYES

FREYSA (cont’d)
Some listen too Here we are An army
now

In the shadows are more Replicants hiding allied Her
silent slithering army A collection of those awakened to a
dream We can sense their dissatisfaction like we can their
number Both vast The shadow of the coming violent storm

FREYSA (contd)
Go on I not so afraid to die Done
right dying the most human thing we do

K lowers the blaster

K
I found Deckard I led Wallace to him

FREYSA
Don’t pay no mind on that He always
wanted to die for his own Never had the
luck Officer did him a favor

K can’t live with that

FREYSA (contd)
Deckard only want his baby stay safe
And she will I wish I could find her
I show her unto the world And she lead
an army

Her eyes sparkle with the future she sees
But K is focused only on one word He feels it like a bullet

K
She

Freysa nods confused by his confusion on the point
FREYSA
Course Rachael have a daughter A baby
girl
An infinite beat Time shatters Gravity upends
K shakes his head No
FREYSA (contd)
With my own eye I see her come I dress
her in blue when time she go

K
No A girl died It was a boy you hid

Freysa shakes her head knowingly

FREYSA
Just a piece a puzzle

A wave of nausea rocks K The crushing realization slowly
taking root eating away at his new soul

He was wrong about who he is

ON K At the moment he sees it The connection forming

INSERT CUT ANA STARING CONFUSED MOVED BY WHAT SHE SEES
IN K’S MEMORY A MOMENT OF RECOGNITION

ANA
No one invented that It was a real
Moment Someone lived this

INSERT CUT THE DENABASE SCREEN THE TWO COPIES THE GHOST
AND THE REAL

DECKARD (VO)
I showed them how to scramble the
records cover their tracks

INSERT CUT THE CHILD WITH THE HORSE IN FRONT OF THE FIERY
FURNACE CHIN SET DETERMINED

INSERT CUT ON ANA LOOKING AT K

ANA
There is a bit of every artist in their
work

BACK ON K RIVEN THE TRUTH REVEALED THE CASE SOLVED AT
HIS OWN EXPENSE IT WAS NEVER HIM AT ALL

Something inside K breaks Freysa can see his pain And
understands

FREYSA
You imagine it was you Ohhhh You
did you did We all wish it was us
That’s why we believe
ON K -- SHAKING -- SHATTERED -- WE MOVE --

CLOSE ON K BLINDING LIGHT BOUNCES OFF HIM

He stands in the FLOODLIGHTS looking up at something
PAINFULLY BRIGHT high and huge in front of him He is ina
fog Soultired No longer connected to physical pain

REVEAL ON THE NEXT BUILDING 30 STORIES HIGH A 120 FOOT
VERSION OF JOI LOOKS DOWN AT THE CITY AN ADVERTISEMENT
LOUNGING RECUMBENT ELBOW BENT TO PROP HER HEAD

K is dwarfed by the enormity of her A man standing before
the sun He stares up at her like she was a holy site

“JOI” sees him down below begins to vamp and twirl An
interactive ad Immediately selling Everything about her
vulgar exaggeration Her voice heard above the city din

JOI
Hello Handsome What a day hmmm

K looks up to her eyes full of longing and need Sees only
the “dead leaf echo” of his Joi Charmless and generic

K searches her face for an answer Can only see THROUGH it

“JOI” (contd)
You look lonely I can fix that

She gives a crass laugh K stares and stares Desperate to
find any spark of the woman he loves praying some part of
her is still in the network still extant

“JOI” (contd)
Aww
(leaning down)
You look like a good Joe

The NAME goes through K like an arrow Joe Jo His mind
fills with doubt and hope and doubt again Was it all part
of her program Was she ever real

No answers from “Joi” Only a knowing wink and her mannequin
smile as she looks back out on the city Selling herself to
the world

CLOSE ON K His eyes close As if saying goodbye To her
To everything he learned from her to dream and hope for

His eyes open on the sky as lightning kindles A storm A
decision made

the wings barely noticeable It follows after --

EXT SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES NIGHT

THE TRANSPORT VAN flies through the FOG and WET SNOW
Flanked by THE TWO DARK SPINNERS

The caravan veers off the main traffic artery Running along

Where the risen ocean meets city Stretching for MILES
DENSE FOG spills over like a waterfall

The caravan cuts through the thick FOG Keeps low to the
rough stormy surface Sprayed by angry waves

unblinking eyes on --

DECKARD
Where are we going

LUV
Home
Deckard’s gaze drifts up to watch the rain and snow stream
across the glass a moment’s peace found there before the

pain promised to follow when --

A LIGHT SHIMMERS through he fog Barely visible

Then -- visible A PILOTFISH COMING FOR THEM FAST --
FLASHING PAST AND VEERING AT THE LAST MOMENT MISSING THEM --

THEN SLAMMING INTO THE SPINNER ESCORT IT EXPLODES
INSTANTLY DEBRIS SPARKING AGAINST THE TRANSPORT

GUN SHOTS WEB THE WINDSHIELD AND KILL THE PILOT

He slumps dead The CO-PILOT grabs the controls

Luv stands searches the sky as --

THE SECOND SPINNER ESCORT TAKES FIRE Its engine ruptures
and it SPIRALS AN EXPLOSION QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED BY A FLOOD
OF OCEAN SPILLING OVER AND ENGULFING IT

Deckard looks out Sees --

K’S SPINNER BULLET PAST Disappearing into the mist

Luv quickly assesses the damage Orders the Co-Pilot

LUV (contd)
Take us back

Co-Pilot BANKS the Transport When out of nowhere --

WHAM K’s Spinner SMASHES into them from underneath
Disappears in the fog again

The Transport’s engine fails -- losing altitude -- SMOKE
BILLOWS off as it descends LUV RAGES

Co-Pilot fights the controls to level them off -- but cannot
stop their descent At which they see --

THE SEA WALL

It looms large as they drop toward it

Deckard watches their descent from his seat as --

THEY CRASH AT THE BASE OF THE SEA WALL A WALL OF OCEAN
WATER rushes over the glass roof

EXT SEPULVEDA SEA WALL

Perched unsteadily at the sea wall’s sloped base A violent
WAVE BASHES over it

engines come alive threatening to LIFT when --

WAVES COME SMASHING DOWN OVER THE VEHICLE
Luv opens the door drawing her weapon

BLAM A BULLET PUNCTURES THE WINDSHIELD CO-PILOT’S HEAD
SNAPS BACK THEN SLUMPS

DECKARD
Looks up Light suddenly streams on his face
ON K

Backlit and FIRING as he comes Heedless of his exposure

Luv holds her position until -- SHE FIRES AT K --
K FIRES -- HITS LUV -- WHO FLIES BACK WITH THE IMPACT
ON K

Coming for Deckard Even as Deckard watches the BLOOD
blossom on K’s chest They meet eyes when --

LUV CHARGES K LIKE A TRAIN TACKLES HIM They tumble like
lovers Luv destroys what’s left of K’s shoulder when --

A CRUSHING WAVE POUNDS THE TRANSPORT AGAINST THE SEA WALL
WATER FILLS THE VEHICLE

K AND LUV

Crush together against the shattered roof to spill out onto --

EXT SEPULVEDA SEA WALL

K and Luv struggle to their feet battered by savage waves --
the same waves that carry the Transport further out into the
water with each impact

Luv focuses her rage to a single point K She throws
herself atop him A wild crazed thing sent from the pit

K’s fist connects with digs into the soft flesh of her
throat with a pulsing drawn out CRAAAAAAACK

Luv only grins -- as if proud he found the strength Then --
A KICK to destroy his ribs sends him backwards as --

INT TRANSPORT VAN

The Transport LURCHES Water floods in
Deckard struggles to free his still cuffed hand --
A colossal wave CRASHES over the Transport tipping it --

EXT SEPULVEDA SEA WALL

K and Luv pause to see the Transport carried out to sea --
and begin to SINK Luv wastes no more time

HER KNIFE SINGS

K dodges it -- blocks it -- grabs it by the blade -- not
seeing --

HER SECOND KNIFE
The blade slips out of K’s gut before he felt it go in
K falls to his knees

LUV
I’m the best one

Luv DIVES into the water toward the Transport and Deckard

INT TRANSPORT VAN

Deckard is up to his neck held down by the shackle

INT UNDERWATER

Deckard submerges to try to pull himself free He fights
like hell -- but can’t do it --

LUV PULLS Deckard back up Faces him in the small pocket of
air remaining Luv grins like the devil on his birthday

LUV
Offworld is waiting

Without a sound K rises in the water behind Luv
GRABS HER BY THE THROAT
LIFTS HER TO THE SHATTERED ROOF

THROWS HER INTO THE WATER HAND CRUSHING HER WINDPIPE AND
HOLDING UNDERWATER

LUV FIGHTS HIM WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAS TEETH BARED BLOODY
BUT K JUST TAKES THE PAIN DOES NOT LET GO

INT UNDERWATER

ON LUV She lashes out wild feral spasms Her mouth
working Unable to find the words to properly hate One
pupil goes wide The eye rolls back in its socket giving a
clear view of the pinprick of color underneath

AND SHE GOES STILL

ON LUV An air bubble of resignation escapes her lips

INT TRANSPORT VAN

THE CREAK OF METAL ABOUT TO GIVE WAY THE WATER LEVEL RISES
DECKARD IS ENTIRELY UNDERWATER LUNGS AFLAME

K swims to him Breaks his retrains

K and Deckard dive out of the sinking tomb

IN THE OCEAN

K and Deckard swim Wave and current conspire to drown them
A WAVE BATTERS K WE LOSE SIGHT OF HIM IN THE WATER

DECKARD

Deckard reaches back CLASPS K’S HAND Helping him back

THE SURFACE EXPLODES K GASPS for breath ANOTHER WAVE
CRASHES them onto the base of THE SEA WALL

EXT SEA WALL BASE

Deckard grabs hold of K before he is swept out into the sea

They find their footing their breath Deckard nods to K
He’s all right They look out to see

THE TRANSPORT VAN SINKS BENEATH THE SURFACE GONE
K and Deckard together further up the sea wall Freezing
But alive Under the blood orange sky of a new day coming

They sit Find their breath

DECKARD
You should’ve let me die

K
You did You drowned in the ocean
Youre free Free to meet your daughter
Tough as he is -- Deckard is overcome with emotion for the
first time in decades Just hearing the word Brings
himself to say it

EXT LAB BUILDING DAWN

K’s hand slips into his pocket Takes out
THE WOODEN HORSE He holds it out to Deckard

Deckard sees it Takes it Can’t believe it still exists
Something made for a child he never met all those years ago

K
All the best memories are hers

Deckard stares at him from a place beyond gratitude

DECKARD
Why What am I to you
K looks at Deckard Wanting him to be so many things

K
Go meet her

Deckard’s eyes fill of thanks beyond words He turns away
Crosses the snowy field To the building TO ANA

ON K Watching him go He lets his hand drop from his wound
A DROP of BLOOD touches the snow

K’S POV Deckard grows smaller in the distance
ON K Fallen in the snow

A pool of blood spreads and stains the white snow around him
as we

MOVE CLOSE ON K’S FACE His eyes catch something near him
only he sees A warm FALSE VOICE comes calming

JOI (VO)
Would you read to me

Just as she said when we first met her K smiles at this
ghost of memory Of course A thready whisper of his
baseline Their old favorite

K (VO)
“And blood-black nothingness began to
spin a system of cells interlinked

And dies

INT MEMORY LAB

Deckard crosses through the door Looks in Looks up

Sees Ana in her lab staring at snow flakes falling from
above A perfect digital reproduction of what falls outside
falls here onto her hands She is completely taken with it
Deckard steps up to the glass that divides the room
Watching her watch the snow fall

ANA
Just a moment Beautiful isn’t it

Ana turns from the digital snow fading out
Takes in the strange stranger at her door
His kind wounded eyes staring at her

Meets them with an innocent smile

Deckard reaches out

Hand pressed against the glass
