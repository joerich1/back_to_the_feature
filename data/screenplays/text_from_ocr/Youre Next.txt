EXT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

An isolated cedar house is positioned a short distance
from a narrow paved road Barren trees surround the rear
of the house

Several lights are on inside the house shining out into
the dark front yard A car is parked in the driveway
INT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sweating TALIA a woman in her 20s rolls over onto her
back naked She is lying on a queen size bed

A man in his early 40s ERIK Harsen lies next to her
They both stare silently up at the ceiling Erik is
somewhat out of breath Neither of them looks
particularly satisfied

Talia abruptly sits up
TALIA
I’m going to go get a drink You want

one

Erik shakes his head Talia rises and exits the room

INT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Naked Talia walks from the bedroom into the front room
She hits a couple of buttons on the stereo and LOUD ROCK
MUSIC begins playing

Nodding her head and swaying slightly to the music Talia
heads for the kitchen

INT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Erik is still lying on the bed The music Talia put on
the stereo is audible from the bedroom echoing

throughout the house

With a sigh Erik rises to his feet and heads towards a
bathroom adjoining the bedroom

A moment later the sound of the SHOWER turning on is
audible from the bathroom
INT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

In the kitchen Talia pours vodka from a bottle into a
glass partially filled with orange juice and ice She

bobs her head to the song that is playing as she screws
the cap back on the bottle

Sipping at her drink Talia starts to exit the kitchen
Then she stops moving looking at something in front of
her

A pair of glass doors lead out from the kitchen into the
backyard One of the doors is OPEN just an inch or so
as if it slipped off its latch

Talia appears to consider this She moves forward and
shuts the door LOCKING IT

Talia hesitates then peers outside through the glass
door into the dark yard of the house

EXT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

From outside the house Talia’s nude form is clearly
visible illuminated within the music inside just barely
audible She looks out through the glass doors into the
dark yard lifting a hand to shield her reflection on the
glass so she can see more clearly

The back yard of the house is dark and empty

INT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

Erik washes himself in the shower rubbing shampoo
through his hair The room is filled with steam The
shower curtain is opaque so that Erik cannot see the
rest of the bathroom

There is a noise from outside the bathroom in the
hallway

Erik hesitates He lowers his head under the shower
faucet rinsing the shampoo from his hair He then calls
out

ERIK
Talia That you You can come in here if
you want

There is no response The bathroom door which is
slightly ajar creaks open further just a few inches
Erik does not notice the door move He listens for a
reply then shrugs and continues bathing himself

INT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Erik steps out of the bathroom holding a towel wrapped
around his waist The same rock song is still playing
distantly on repeat

Erik looks up and down the hallway

Near the doorway to the dark bedroom a small amount of
what looks like orange juice mixed with vodka is spilled
on the floor A couple of melting ice cubes rest in the
center of the spill

Erik frowns down at this puzzled

ERIK
Talia

Erik moves towards the bedroom stepping over the puddle
in his bare feet
INT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The lights in the bedroom are off Erik comes to a stop
facing the window

Most of the illumination in the room comes from the
backyard light which shines in through the window

The words “YOU’RE NEXT have been written on the inside
of the bedroom window in blood

Beneath the window Talia’s DEAD BODY lies crumpled on
the floor her back to Erik Her hair matted with dark
blood covers her features

Erik standing naked stares speechlessly at Talia’s body
in front of him His towel has dropped from his waist to
the floor He does not appear to be aware of this

A DARK FIGURE is now standing DIRECTLY BEHIND ERIK only
about a foot away Its face is not visible in the
darkness

In a quick movement the figure REACHES FOR ERIK

CUT TO
EXT EDELWEISS DRIVE - DUSK

A couple PAUL and AUBREY DAVISON white 60s drive
their polished Jeep down a winding rural drive The sun
is beginning to set through the trees behind them

They drive the Jeep past Erik Harsen’s cedar house His
car is still parked in the driveway

INT PAUL’S JEEP - DUSK - CONTINUOUS
Aubrey glances over at Erik’s house as they near it

AUBREY
Looks like Erik Harsen’s here That’s
strange

Paul looks over following her gaze All of the lights in
Erik Harsen’s house are still on

PAUL
I think I heard something about him and
Linda getting separated He might be
living here now

Aubrey makes a disappointed noise

AUBREY
That’s a shame
(pause)
We should check in on him later see how
he’s doing

Paul nods They continue driving past Erik’s house

EXT DAVISON MANSION - EVENING - MINUTES LATER

Paul pulls the Jeep into the driveway of a large
isolated mansion He and Aubrey climb out and walk to the
house carrying luggage

Paul fumbles for a key in his pocket He moves to unlock
the front door then turns the key loosely in the lock

PAUL
That’s odd

AUBREY
What

PAUL

It’s unlocked
Paul turns the doorknob and pushes the heavy front door
open

INT DAVIS MANSION - ENTRYWAY - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Paul steps into the doorway peering into the house It
is dark and empty Paul steps inside leaving the door
opens Aubrey follows him

The house is partly in a state of disrepair Protective
sheets are draped over the furniture

Paul switches on the light in the entryway and looks
around

PAUL
Huh Doesn’t looks like anyone’s been in
here Guess the workers must have left it
unlocked the last time they were here
(joking)
Safe neighborhood

Aubrey is taking in the dim front room to the house

AUBREY
This place still needs so much work Why
couldn’t we have all just got together at
the condo instead

PAUL
We discussed this Crispian didn’t want
to drive the extra three hours And this
is just as close to the airport

AUBREY
(sighs )
Yes I know

Paul’s cell phone BUZZES in his pocket He takes it out
and looks at it hitting buttons

PAUL
Speaking of Crispian

AUBREY
What’s going on

PAUL
Oh I guess he and this new girl are
running late They won’t get here until
eleven or so
AUBREY
At least that gives us a couple of hours
to clean up around here

PAUL
That’s the spirit I’ll go bring the
groceries in then check on the furnace
You want to start on this floor

AUBREY
Might as well

Paul nods and exits Aubrey sets her bags down and heads
towards the front room

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Aubrey approaches a large dining table that is covered
with a white sheet She takes a corner of the sheet and
pulls it off the table sending motes of dust wafting
into the air

Aubrey waves the dust away from her face then begins
folding the sheet

INT CRISPIAN’S CAR - EVENING

CRISPIAN a bearded man in his mid 30s drives a sedan
along a dark highway In the passenger seat is ERIN 20s
attractive She scrolls through her cell phone in the
dark car

CRISPIAN
We should be there pretty soon I think I
remember this from when dad showed us
this place

Crispian glances at a passing sign

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
No maybe not

ERIN
So your parents are pretty loaded

CRISPIAN
I guess so When my dad retired from KPG
last year he got some insane severance
package He was a VP for like twenty
years I don’t know the number but my
mom said something about mid seven
figures
ERIN
KPG Like the defense contractor You
never told me your father worked for
them

CRISPIAN
Yeah he was just in marketing though
Why Is that a problem for you baby
Having dinner with fascists

ERIN
Not at all I told you I wanted to meet
your family I hope this means there’s
going to be some good booze at your
place though

CRISPIAN
Probably not My mom’s on medication

ERIN
Oh We should stop off somewhere and get
some

CRISPIAN
Good thinking

They continue driving down the dark highway

INT DAVISON MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Aubrey enters the kitchen She wets a rag at the kitchen
faucet then begins wiping down the counter

Above Aubrey the ceiling CREAKS She ceases her work
listening

The sound of FOOTSTEPS is clearly audible on the floor
above Aubrey not overly loud but distinct like someone
trying to walk quietly in heavy boots

The sound moves across the ceiling to the corner nearest
the outside wall then ceases The house is silent

Aubrey resumes wiping the counter

PAUL (0S)
Hey

Aubrey spins around startled dropping her rag Paul is
standing directly behind her in the doorway to the
kitchen
PAUL (CONT’D)
I’ll need your help putting together the
beds-—

Paul notices the look on Aubrey’s face

PAUL (CONTD)
What

AUBREY
You weren’t- Were you just upstairs

PAUL
No I haven’t been up there yet I had to
light the furnace

AUBREY
Did you hear that Just now
PAUL
Hear what
Aubrey speaks rapidly
AUBREY

I heard footsteps upstairs There’s
someone here in this house Some homeless
person or squatters or something

Paul hesitates

PAUL
Are you sure It’s an old building-

AUBREY
It was footsteps Paul We need to get
out of here right now

PAUL
Okay okay

Paul allows Aubrey to lead him out of the kitchen

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

When Paul and Aubrey reach the entryway Paul stops
Aubrey continues moving for the front door then looks
back at Paul

PAUL
Listen you go outside Go wait in the
car or something I’m just going to go
check upstairs
AUBREY
No Come with me

PAUL
It’s probably just the house settling
Aubrey

Aubrey stares at Paul Paul sighs

PAUL (CONTD)
Here I’ll take this okay

Paul lifts a HEAVY WALKING STICK from where it is leaning
near the door

PAUL (CONT’D)
Happy

Aubrey says nothing
PAUL (CONTD)
Go wait out in the car Listen to the

radio or something I’1l be right out

Paul moves towards the stairs leading up the second
floor Aubrey hesitates then slowly steps outside

EXT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Paul climbs the stairs to the dark second floor holding
the walking stick out in front of him

At the top of the stairs Paul hesitates looking up and
down the hallway Several doorways extend from the
hallway leading into dark bedrooms

Paul moves a distance down the dark hallway then flicks
on a light switch illuminating it

Paul hesitates then looking somewhat embarrassed calls
out down the hallway

PAUL
Is anyone up here

The floor is silent Paul’s voice echoes slightly
throughout the empty floor

Paul waits for a moment then shakes his head Relaxing
his posture slightly he continues moving forward
EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Aubrey stands on the front lawn near the Jeep her arms
crossed in front of her shivering in the cold

A strong breeze moves the leaves in the trees on either
side of the yard Aubrey looks up at the shifting leaves

A RUSTLING sound comes from nearby Aubrey starts
turning around A cluster of dead leaves tumbles across
the driveway pushed by the wind

Aubrey turns back towards the house

AUBREY
Paul

INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Paul steps from the hallway into a large bedroom
featuring a king size bed with sheets and a blanket on
it The bed is made a lamp next to it

Paul flicks on the wall light switch and looks around the
room He is the only person in the room

Paul starts to turn back into the hallway when a CREAKING
SOUND comes from behind him

Frowning Paul slowly turns back around facing into the
bedroom

The bedroom closet door is open a couple of inches
Inside the closet is dark Nothing is visible within

Paul frowns as if trying to remember if the closet was
open before

No further sound comes from the closet Hesitantly Paul
takes a step forward

A HAND SLAPS DOWN on Paul’s shoulder Paul spins around
with a YELL raising the walking stick

Crispian is standing behind Paul holding a bottle of
whiskey He raises it defensively

CRISPIAN
Whoa dad

Paul quickly lowers the walking stick He puts his other
hand on his chest

PAUL
Jesus Christ Crispian

CRISPIAN
Yeah

Crispian takes a step back towards the hallway his eyes
still on the walking stick in Paul’s hand

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Um Dad not to get off on the wrong foot
or anything but why is mom standing in
the front yard and crying

EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Erin is standing next to Aubrey in the front yard one
hand on her shoulder Aubrey’s mascara is streaked She
looks up as Paul and Crispian approach

Paul moves to stand by his wife She sniffles

PAUL
It’s fine Crispian and I looked in every
room on the second floor There’s no one
there It’s just an old house They make
noises

AUBREY
(to Crispian)
I’m so silly You’re probably so

embarrassed

CRISPIAN
No mom it’s fine Dad uh this is
Erin

PAUL

Lovely to meet you Erin

ERIN
Likewise Mister Davison

They shake hands Pause Crispian hefts the bottle he is
holding

CRISPIAN
We brought whiskey

INT DAVISON MANSION - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Erin and Crispian slightly tipsy get undressed for bed
Erin looks around the sparse bedroom

ERIN
So your dad bought this place to fix up

CRISPIAN
Yeah Supposed to be his retirement
project or something give him something
to work on Except so far I think he’s
just been paying other people to work on
it

ERIN
Your folks seem cool I mean for people
with money You’re lucky

CRISPIAN
I guess so

ERIN
You are You don’t know what most people
would give to have folks like yours

CRISPIAN
Whatever that means

They climb into bed Erin snuggles up to Crispian whose
eyes are open looking up at the ceiling

ERIN
Your brothers and sister are getting in
tomorrow

CRISPIAN
Yeah Tomorrow’s my parents’ actual
anniversary

ERIN
(sleepily)
Thirty-five years Can you imagine

CRISPIAN
I can’t really

ERIN
Well I’m looking forward to meeting the
rest of your family tomorrow

CRISPIAN
Yeah They’re something It’s the first
time weve all been together in awhile
It should be interesting

ERIN
How so

CRISPIAN
Eh You’1l see

Erin closes her eyes

INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the spacious bedroom down the hall Aubrey and Paul
lie next to each other on a king-sized bed Paul is
wearing a sleep mask

There is a CREAKING outside the room like that of a
HEAVY WEIGHT shifting on floorboards Aubrey frowns in
her sleep but does not open her eyes

The noise comes again the sound of SLOW DELIBERATE
FOOTSTEPS moving down the hall outside their bedroom
like someone large trying to walk quietly

Aubrey’s eyes open She listens as the sound of the
footsteps RECEDES down the hallway

AUBREY
(whispering)
Paul

Paul does not move Aubrey reaches out and shakes his
shoulder still whispering softly

AUBREY (CONTD)
Paul

Paul rolls onto his back but does not remove his eyemask

PAUL
What

AUBREY
Did you hear that

PAUL
Hear what

AUBREY
Footsteps In the hallway

PAUL
It’s probably just Crispian or his
girlfriend

Paul rolls back onto his side

AUBREY
Their bedroom’s at the other end of the
hall

PAUL

Maybe what’s her name Erin is looking
for something

AUBREY
It didn’t sound like Erin

PAUL
(sighing)
Go back to sleep Aubrey Please We
locked every door and window before we
went to bed and we’re out in the middle
of nowhere Nobody’s going to break in
here

Aubrey looks at Paul’s masked face for a long moment
then turns onto her other side and reaches for a
prescription bottle of pills on her bedside table

Aubrey taps out a pill considers then taps out a second
one She reaches for a glass on the table

The glass is empty Only a few drops of water remain at
the bottom

AUBREY
(muttering)
Drat

INT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Aubrey wearing a robe and slippers exits the master
bedroom holding her empty glass in one hand

Aubrey anxiously looks up and down the dark hallway then
shakes her head as if embarrassed with herself and
steps forward

She walks slowly down the hallway moving quietly The
floorboards creak slightly under her feet much softer
than the noise she heard in bed

Aubrey hesitates as if considering this then continues
past the guest bedroom towards the stairs

INT DAVISON MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Aubrey walks through the dark dining room into the
kitchen

As Aubrey turns a FACE is visible in one of the kitchen
windows behind her barely discernible A figure wearing
some sort of ANIMAL MASK over his face is peering inside
the kitchen from the dark front yard watching Aubrey

The figure is still only just visible in the corner of
the window frame

Aubrey does not notice the face in the window Still
moving quietly she steps into the kitchen and crosses to
the counter

Aubrey begins to fill a glass with water from a glass
bottle As she does so the figure in the window suddenly
DUCKS OUT OF SIGHT

A second later a light TURNS ON outside illuminating a
patch of the front yard as if a security light with a
motion sensor was just triggered Nothing is visible
through the illuminated window

Aubrey still does not notice this She tosses her two
pills into her mouth and swallows them with a long drink
of water She then blinks as if already feeling the
pills take effect

AUBREY
Mmm

Dreamily Aubrey turns around She does not appear to
register that the security light is on outside until it
suddenly GOES DARK when she is halfway across the room

Aubrey stops frowning Still holding her glass of water
she steps to the window

Aubrey looks out into the dark front yard of the house
her breath fogging the cold windowpane

Nothing is visible outside A light breeze moves the
barren branches of the trees in the yard

Aubrey watches the wind move the limbs of the tree She
blinks slowly then turns and exits the kitchen

INT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Aubrey sleepily walks down the dark hallway and enters
the master bedroom Paul is still lying on his side in
bed facing away from her

INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Aubrey shuts the door behind her and crosses to her side
of the bed She sets down her glass of water and climbs
under the covers curling up next to Paul

Aubrey is almost immediately asleep her face relaxing
her breathing soft and regular Paul’s breathing is quiet
as well muffled by his pillow

INT DAVISON MANSION - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the guest bedroom Erin is curled up next to Crispian
asleep

Crispian is seated in bed propped against his pillow He
is reading a book with a small reading light clamped to
its cover making notes in its margins with a pen

Crispian looks tired and restless He flips a page
adjusting his reading light

A CREAKING SOUND comes from across the room

Crispian looks up at the noise

The closet door across from the bed is just slightly
ajar so that Crispian can see into the closet The

interior of the closet is completely dark

Sitting in bed Crispian looks into the dark closet for a
long moment frowning

In bed next to him Erin suddenly shifts rolling over
onto her back She mumbles inarticulately

Crispian looks at her startled the moment broken He
watches Erin sleep for a moment then reaches out and
brushes a stand of hair from her face

Erin frowns in her sleep at his touch then resumes
sleeping quietly

Crispian smiles switches off his light and shuts his
book He lies down in bed next to Erin draping one arm
over her and shuts his eyes

INT DAVISON MANSION - GUEST BEDROOM - MORNING

Crispian’s eyes snap open He is alone in the bed
Morning light is streaming in the through the windows

Crispian looks around the room in bleary confusion
blinking sleepily

INT DAVISON MANSION - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

In the house’s library Erin is seated on the sofa
opposite a couple in their mid-30s DRAKE and KELLY who
are wearing expensive clothing and wedding rings They
are all watching a football game on a large television

Crispian now dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt enters
the library rubbing his eyes Drake looks up at
Crispian’s approach

DRAKE
Hey little brother Get a good night’s
sleep

CRISPIAN

Yeah I guess I did
Drake and Crispian awkwardly shake hands

CRISPIAN (CONTD)

Crispian sits down next to Erin who leans up against
him
INT DAVISON MANSION - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Aubrey works in the kitchen washing dishes Erin appears
in the doorway behind her

Aubrey does not seem to notice Erin Erin politely clears
her throat

Aubrey looks back at Erin
ERIN

Hey I was just wondering if I could help
you in here with anything

Aubrey smiles thinly

AUBREY

No I think I’ve got it under control
Thank you

Erin nods politely and moves to exit Aubrey hesitates
then calls after her

AUBREY (CONTD)
Erin

Erin reappears in the doorway

AUBREY (CONTD)

Actually we’re almost out of butter Or
margarine I have enough to cook with
but not enough for the table The store’s
too far but I was wondering if you could
drive over to our neighbor’s and see if

he has some His name’s Erik He knows
us

Erin smiles brightly as if relieved to have a task

ERIN
Sure thing I saw the house when Crispian
and I drove in I’1ll just walk there if
it’s not too urgent I could use to
stretch my legs

AUBREY
That’s fine

Aubrey turns back to the sink Erin exits the kitchen

INT DAVISON MANSION - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

Erin walks through the library using a WOODEN DOOR
hidden in the wall to step out onto the back porch

EXT DAVISON MANSION - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

On the back porch Paul and Crispian are treating boards

with wood stain positioned across two sawhorses
Crispian brushes the boards while Paul watches his work

Drank stands nearby watching them both drinking from a
bottle of beer Erin emerges from the house behind them

ERIN
Hey guys

All three men turn to look at Erin

ERIN (CONTD)
Your mom asked me to walk over to the
neighbor’s see if I could borrow some
Margarine Anyone need anything

Paul and Crispian look up at Erin Paul shakes his head

CRISPIAN
We’re fine

Crispian smiles at Erin Erin smiles back at him and
quickly takes a small DIGITAL CAMERA out of her pocket

ERIN
Hold that

Crispian continues smiling Paul and Drake face the
camera with Crispian somewhat awkwardly

Erin quickly snaps a photo of Crispian Paul and Drake
She checks the view screen on the back of her camera The
three men look slightly uncomfortable in their poses

ERIN (CONTD)
Great Okay then See you guys in a bit

Erin steps back inside the house Drake drains the rest
of his beer

DRAKE
I’m going to go check on Kelly

Paul nods Drake goes inside leaving Paul alone with
Crispian They work in silence for a moment

PAUL
How’s that fellowship thing coming along

CRISPIAN
Oh I didn’t get it

PAUL
No

CRISPIAN
No I guess they had a lot of applicants
And I haven’t exactly been published
recently

PAUL
Uh-huh Well I’m sorry to hear that

CRISPIAN
There’s always next year

Paul says nothing focusing on his work

INT DAVISON MANSION - SPARE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Drake steps inside the spare bedroom on the second floor
The shower is running in a bathroom adjoining the spare
bedroom Drake looks around the bedroom

The sound of the water running in the bathroom comes to a
stop Drake looks up at this

INT DAVISON MANSION - SPARE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Drake opens the door to the spare bedroom’s bathroom
Kelly is toweling off in the shower

DRAKE
Hey

KELLY
Hey Shut the door

Drake shuts the door behind him Kelly continues drying
her body Drake wipes steam off the mirror and examines
his reflection

KELLY (CONTD)
Where did your brother find that girl

anyway

DRAKE
What Erin

KELLY
Yeah

DRAKE

I think she took one of his classes
(off her look)
Yeah I know
(MORE)
DRAKE (CONTD)
Maybe she was his teaching assistant I
get the stories confused At any rate
she’s a grad student now

KELLY
That’s kind of weird So he was her
professor

DRAKE
(indifferent)
Yeah Well adjunct professor

Kelly moves next to Drake and begins rubbing moisturizer
on her face in small circles

KELLY
I guess it’s probably hard for him to
meet women his age given his career
prospects

DRAKE
Not every man gets as lucky as me

Drake reaches out to cup one of Kelly’s bare breasts
Absently she swats his hand away continuing to apply
moisturizer

KELLY
Well it helps that you’re not a complete
loser
DRAKE
(mildly)

That’s true Do you have any Vicodin

KELLY
In my purse

Drake exits the bathroom

EXT ERIK HARSEN’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

Humming to herself Erin walks down the road towards Erik
Harsen’s house His car is still parked in the driveway
and the lights in the house are still on despite it
being daylight out

Erin takes this in then walks up the path to the front
door of Erik’s house She knocks on the door

The rock song playing in Erik Harsen’s house is faintly
audible from outside Erin waits several seconds then
knocks again

There is no response Erin moves forward and peers in
through a window on the side of the door

Erin can only see part of the front room of Erik’s house
from her vantage point The lights are on but no one is
visible inside She can just see the corner of the sofa
in the living room

Meanwhile Drake and Tariq are engaged in conversation

DRAKE
So Tariq what do you do

TARIQ

DRAKE
Oh Anything I’ve seen

TARIQ
There’s a series not far from here the
Cleveland Underground Film Festival Did

DRAKE

No I guess I must have missed it
TARIQ

Oh I had a short film there last year
DRAKE

Ah Have you ever thought about directing

commercials
Aimee and Tariq speak simultaneously
TARIQ AIMEE
I havent really- He doesn’t want to direct

commercials Drake

DRAKE (CONTD)
Okay then

Before Tariq can continue Drake turns away
DRAKE (CONTD)
Erin

Erin looks up having not been paying attention

ERIN
Yeah

DRAKE
How about you Are you still in school

ERIN
Yeah this is my last year I’m finishing
my master’s

Tarig distracted frowns at something outside the
window Drake gestures at Crispian

DRAKE
And are you two still working together

CRISPIAN
No Erin is no longer my TA We didn’t
think it was appropriate

Erin and Crispian exchange a smile
DRAKE

(nodding)
Yeah probably not too professional

Crispian turns and sets down his fork Tariq is still

staring outside

CRISPIAN

What’s that supposed to mean
DRAKE

What
CRISPIAN

“Probably not too professional”
Something on your mind

DRAKE
No I mean you said it wasn’t
appropriate and I agreed with you

CRISPIAN
I don’t think you’re in a position to be
judging my moral decisions

PAUL AUBREY
Now boys Can’t we have a dinner
without you two arguing

Felix takes a drink of wine Ignored by everyone Tariq
rises and moves over to the window

DRAKE
I’m not going to rise to the bait on
that I was just agreeing with you

That’s all
CRISPIAN
Okay fine Let’s drop it
DRAKE
Fine
TARIQ

Hey What is that guy doing

Everyone looks over at Tariq who is standing in front of
the window

At that exact moment a short crossbow ARROW smashes
through the glass pane of the window and HITS TARIQ
SQUARE IN THE FOREHEAD

Aimee gasps Tariq takes a step back then turns to face
the family There is an arrow sticking out of his head
BLOOD is flowing down his face

Everyone is silent in shock Tariq his eyes looking
upward reaches up tentatively to touch the arrow that is
protruding from his forehead

His fingers almost reach it then he pitches forward

As Tariq drops the arrow in his head hits the edge of
the kitchen table driving it FURTHER into his brain

Beneath the dining room table Tarig’s face IMPACTS THE
FLOOR JAMMING the point of the arrow out through the
back of his SKULL

Everyone stares at Tariq’s corpse Felix is the first to
move

FELIX
Holy fuck

Felix leaps out of his seat as another arrow CRASHES
THROUGH THE WINDOW and EMBEDS ITSELF in the back of
Paul’s chair with a THUNK

Yelling with surprise Paul throws himself to the floor

Suddenly the room is SCREAMING PANDEMONIUM as everyone
tries to get away from the windows All the family
scramble in different directions running to the side and
crawling along the floor

THREE MORE ARROWS fly into the room in quick succession
as everyone flees Two of them hit the wall and the
third sticks into DRAKE’S SHOULDER as he runs into the
kitchen He is the last to leave the dining room

Drake hits the entryway floor and skids across the
linoleum

Everyone is suddenly quiet staring around Aimee
huddled on the entryway floor shrieks

AIMEE
What the fuck is happening

Everyone is quiet for a moment in the darkness Aubrey
somewhere in the front room calls out

AUBREY
Nine-one-one

Everyone fumbles for their cell phones

ERIN
I don’t have a signal

Crispian squints down at his smartphone

CRISPIAN
Me neither but that’s nothing new

Felix is squinting at his cell phone Behind him in the
entryway Kelly is tending to the wounded Drake

FELIX
Nothing
(to Zee)
Zee check your burner

Zee pulls out a disposable cell phone and checks it no
signal

ERIN
Nobody has anything

PAUL
I had a full signal earlier today How is
this possible
FELIX
They must be using a jammer

PAUL
What

FELIX
A cell phone blocker They’re illegal
but you can get a battery-powered one off
the internet for about thirty bucks
Usually the portable ones have a maximum
range of a few hundred feet

Everyone looks outside

Nothing is visible through the windows It is quiet all
down the dark street

AUBREY
I don’t think we should go out there

PAUL
If it’s some signal blocking device all
wed have to do is make it down the road

AUBREY
You don’t know that A tower could be
down in this area or something That
happens We’re not even sure what’s going
on Maybe it’s just some accident

Paul looks at Aubrey She is quiet
FELIX
We parked in the driveway We’re blocking
you in but it’s not that far

AIMEE
Tariq has the keys

Everyone looks down at Tariq’s corpse
Crispian clears his throat
CRISPIAN
We’re not blocked in The drive’s not
that far I think I could make it

Erin looks outside Nothing is visible

ERIN
Why would anyone do this

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

In the entryway Kelly and Zee are kneeling next to
Drake Drake is examining the arrow in his shoulder

KELLY
Should we pull it out

DRAKE
Yes

ZEE
No that’s a bad idea You’re not
supposed to remove anything sharp before
you get to the emergency room You don’t
know what kind of tendons or veins could
be caught up in there

Drake looks down at the arrow in his shoulder

DRAKE
So I just have to leave it like that

ZEE
We could clip the end off with shears or
something

DRAKE

Do you have any
Zee is silent

KELLY
Are you in a lot of pain

Drake looks at her incredulously
Kelly reaches into her purse and pulls out a prescription
bottle Drake nods and she taps out one pill Drake holds

his fingers up two

Kelly shakes her head Drake frowns and points at the
arrow sticking out of his shoulder

Kelly shrugs and pours out another pill She hands Drake
the two pills He dry swallows them

DRAKE
Thanks

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

DRAKE

Crispian looks over at Drake in the entryway

CRISPIAN

DRAKE

not with this thing in my shoulder

CRISPIAN
What does your shoulder have to do with
your legs

DRAKE

Crispian Which you’d know if you’d ever
jogged farther than the distance from
your couch to your refrigerator

CRISPIAN

PAUL

Aimee you’d just have to get to your

car Our neighbor Erik is staying at his
house just a little ways down It’s the
only other house on the street If you

Aimee exhales

AIMEE

The sound of a WINDOW SHATTERING comes from the LIBRARY

As Aimee races into the entryway Felix quickly moves to
one side of the front door He nods anxiously as Aimee
moves towards him Felix yanks the door OPEN

Without hesitating Aimee SPRINTS past her brother into
the open doorway

As soon as she leaps over the threshold she comes to a
sudden stop

Aimee stands unmoving in the front doorway Only her
silhouette is visible from inside the house

Paul Erin and Aubrey have all moved forward into the
entryway

PAUL
Aimee

Aimee makes a small noise

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

A THIN PIECE OF PIANO WIRE has been strung horizontally
across the front doorway of the Davison mansion and
coated with shoe polish It is EMBEDDED in the front of
Aimee’s NECK halfway back to her spine

BLOOD GUSHES down the front of Aimee’s body

Aimee dying tilts her head back and drops Blood sprays
upward

The wire gives off a low bass note as Aimee’s neck falls
free from it

Aimee’s body falls Her head lolls to one side exposing
its arteries Blood sprays out soaking Aubrey’s shoes

Paul leaps for Aubrey quickly covering her eyes with his
hands but he is too late She SCREAMS once quickly
then begins breathing shallowly hyperventilating

Erin looks away from this then begins moving towards the
library She glances down at the shard of porcelain in
her hand then tosses it to the carpet crossing quickly
to the fireplace rack

Erin takes the same FIRE POKER that Paul carried and
hefts it stepping towards the library

CRISPIAN
What are you doing

towards the library

She turns to face Crispian

ERIN (CONTD)

We need to board up all of the doors and

ERIN
Some places if you text nine-one-one
they get it as a voicemail If you even
have one bar you can send a text

Erin finishes typing “13 Edelweiss Dr - two dead - help
please” She hits “SEND”

Erin starts to pocket her phone when it BEEPS She lifts
it to peer at the screen which bears an error message
reading “SENDING FAILED TRY AGAIN”

CRISPIAN
Those things are useless

Erin exhales

ERIN
I‘1ll have it keep trying

Erin hits the “SEND” button again pockets her phone and
moves quickly for the stairs Crispian follows her

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

get her up there And Drake we need to
take care of his shoulder

Drake and Felix are pulling Aimee’s body away from the
front door so they can close the front door Neither of
them look directly at her corpse as they do so

Felix moves across the front room quickly and pulls the
tablecloth off the dining table He comes back into the
entryway and drapes it over Aimee’s corpse covering her
from sight

Paul seated next to Aubrey on the floor nods at Felix

PAUL
Thank you

Felix nods stiffly Behind him Drake locks the chain on
the door

DRAKE
My shoulder’s fine

ERIN
Are you sure

Drake reaches up and taps the arrow sticking out of his
shoulder Everyone else winces he doesn’t react

DRAKE
Yeah totally

ERIN
Okay We should cover up the windows

Paul rises to his feet helping Aubrey to stand Paul
looks suddenly much older

PAUL
Thank you Erin

ERIN
Sure We’re all going to get out of this

Paul moves past Crispian and Erin on the stairwell
helping Aubrey with each step Aubrey appears practically
catatonic

Crispian is looking at Erin strangely

CRISPIAN
I’ve never seen you act like this before

ERIN
(shortly)
It’s a unique situation

Erin moves down the stairs

FELIX
I think someone should make a run for the
cars

ERIN

No That’s a bad idea

FELIX
Are you sure We need to call the police
Besides whoever did this is probably
gone right

ERIN
(shrugs)
You can try it

Paul switches off the light to the room He turns the key
on the inside of the door’s lock steps out of the room
and rattles the doorknob from the outside to make sure
that it is locked

Aubrey lies still in bed in the dark room The sound of
Paul moving down the stairs is just audible

Aubrey begins softly crying using her pillow to muffle
her sobs

There is a sound from somewhere in the room Aubrey
abruptly stops crying

Aubrey stays very still frozen listening The sound
does not come again

Aubrey turns her head looking around

At the foot of her bed a figure RISES UP in the
darkness that of a LARGE MAN

The man is dressed in black and is wearing a cheap
plastic ANIMAL MASK that covers his face that of a FOX
He straightens standing at the end of the bed He is
holding a MACHETE

a TIGER MASK who is standing outside the window He
stares in at her

In a swift movement the tiger-masked man punches his
gloved fist through the window SHATTERING THE WINDOW
from the outside

The tiger-masked man reaches through the window and GRABS
ERIN’S HAIR

He yanks Erin’s head forward as if trying to cut her
throat on the BROKEN GLASS jutting up from the window
frame

Erin jams the BLADE of her KNIFE up through the tiger-
masked man’s forearm The blade comes out of the top of
his arm jammed between the radius and ulna bones

Erin spins and SLAMS the exposed blade into the wall
PINNING THE MAN’S ARM to the inside kitchen wall

s

The tiger-masked man the rest of his body outside the
house HISSES QUIETLY in pain

Erin spins away and runs into the kitchen She throws
open two drawers before she sees what she wants A LARGE
MEAT CLEAVER

Erin grabs the meat cleaver and turns back towards the
broken window

The tiger-masked man is GONE The knife is now missing
from the wall though the paint on the wall is wet with
blood from where he pulled his arm away

soaked with blood

Kelly stops staring down at Erik’s corpse

The lamb-masked man RUSHES UP at her from behind

straight down into a GLASS COFFEE TABLE shattering it

As Kelly impacts with the table the CD player on the

still He switches his grip on the golf club then SWINGS
IT DOWN like a genuine golf swing

The lamb-masked man swings the club down AGAIN AND
AGAIN BLOOD SPATTERS the wall behind him

On his final swing the man releases the club It remains
STANDING UPRIGHT as if embedded deeply into Kellys

and begin pulling him into the dining room leaving Paul
seated in the entryway

INT DAVISON MANSION - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Felix Zee and Erin drag Drake into the dining room Erin
looks over towards curtains that cover a window alcove

ERIN
There

Erin Felix and Zee manage to carry the prone Drake into
the alcove Erin pulls the curtains shut obscuring his
body from view She turns to Felix and Zee

ERIN (CONT’D)
What’s the best room for us to all be in

FELIX
I don’t know They all have windows
Except the basement

ERIN
Basement’s a bad idea They could just
pour gas down the stairs throw in a
match We want a place with multiple
points of exit

Erin nods to the front room

ERIN (CONTD)
We should stay in there

Felix and Zee stare at Erin Erin looks towards the
kitchen as if remembering something

ERIN (CONTD)
Oh speaking of

Erin exits the dining room

ZEE
She’s interesting

Felix nods

INT DAVISON MANSION - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Erin walks quickly into the kitchen The large pot of
VEGETABLE OIL she created is BOILING RAPIDLY on the
stove

Erin quickly switches off the burner yanking her hand
away to avoid getting splattered She moves away from the
stove

Erin looks up at the broken kitchen window and the patch
of blood on the wall next to it

Erin considers it for a moment

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Erin strides into the front room Her arms are filled
with CUTLERY and a METAL MEAT TENDERIZER MALLET Felix
and Zee are standing having pulled Drake into the front
room with them

ERIN
Okay we should each carry a weapon I’ve
got-—

KELLY’S DEAD BODY SMASHES through the large windows to
the side of Erin as if thrown

Kelly’s corpse hits Erin’s legs KNOCKING HER into the
dining table
The knives Erin was holding go FLYING everywhere

Erin falls beneath the dining table her arms curled up
to protect her head

The TIGER-MASKED MAN steps into the front room through
the shattered window He is holding an AXE

Erin beneath the table reaches for the closest KNIFE
in front of her It is just out of reach

Just before Erin’s fingers can close around the knife
the tiger-masked man GRABS ONE OF HER ANKLES with his
free hand and DRAGS HER OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE The
knife slides from her grasp

The tiger-masked man pulls Erin out exposing her With a
SNARL he lifts the axe up then BRINGS IT DOWN

Erin rolls onto her side The blade SMASHES into the
wooden floor within inches of her head

The tiger-masked man snarls again with annoyance and
YANKS THE AXE BACK ripping it out of the floor

Erin rolls onto her back lifts one leg straight up and
KICKS the man IN THE GROIN

The tiger-masked man GRUNTS

In his moment of hesitation Erin rolls to the side and
grabs the METAL MEAT TENDERIZER MALLET off the floor

Lying on her side Erin swings the mallet HARD into the
man’s KNEE

The tiger-masked man HOWLS and LURCHES FORWARD his
kneecap audibly CRACKING His head SMACKS DOWN on the
dining room table

Erin quickly comes to her feet and grabs the man’s head
pushing it back down on the table

Holding him in place Erin begins HAMMERING the side of
the man’s face with the steel mallet keeping him pinned
to the table

Two blows with the spiked mallet take the flesh and skin
off the man’s head EXPOSING HIS SKULL

Erin’s third blow CAVES IN HIS SKULL

Erin lets the man fall to the floor She is breathing
hard

Zee cowering in the front room looks pale and
terrified

ZEE
Is he dead

Erin leans down and grabs the man’s shattered head with
BOTH HANDS She braces her knee against his back then
pulls back his head BREAKING HIS NECK

Without letting go Erin removes the man’s tiger mask and
lifts him up by his collar so that Zee and Felix can see
his face He is an average-looking man in his twenties

Erin is out of breath

ERIN
Anyone know this guy

Felix is standing behind Zee on the other side of the
living room They both shake their heads

FELIX
Though it’s kind of hard to tell

Erin looks down at the man she is holding up Half of his
face is MISSING

ERIN
Eh

Erin lets the man’s body drop and wipes her hands on her
jeans She looks down at Kelly’s dead body

There are now four corpses on the floor of the two
adjoining rooms Tariq Aimee Kelly and the tiger-masked
man

Erin’s attention remains focused on Kelly

FELIX
I’m sure Crispian is fine

Erin looks up at him Felix is looking at Kelly

FELIX (CONTD)
Crispian’s a tough guy

ERIN
No he’s not But thanks And thanks for
the help by the way
Felix holds up his hands

FELIX
Hey You seemed to have a handle on it

ERIN
Yeah don’t worry about it I probably
would’ve run if I were you So that’s
something
Erin moves into the living room

ERIN (CONT’D)
Where’s your dad

Felix and Zee look around

INT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING
Paul moves slowly from the upstairs hallway into the
master bedroom He is holding a KITCHEN KNIFE

INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING

Paul moves into the room with Aubrey’s body on the bed
He stares at it for a long time

Suddenly the LIGHTS IN THE ROOM GO OUT

EXT DAVISON MANSION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The lights in the entire house are abruptly dark

Erin looks around the suddenly dark room Felix is
looking upstairs

ERIN
Where’s the circuit box

FELIX

basement Why don’t you look there I’m
going to go upstairs and try to find dad

Erin nods quickly Felix exits the front room followed
by Zee

INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING

Paul turns to the light switch near the room’s door He
flicks it down then back up The room remains dark
INT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING

Paul moves from the master bedroom out into the hallway
He opens a small closet door in the hallway

Inside the closet is a CIRCUIT BREAKER BOX Its master
switch is in the OFF position

Paul makes a noise then flips the switch to ON

The lights in the hallway come on

Briefly something is visible in the open doorway to the
guest bedroom QUICKLY MOVING OUT OF VIEW The figure is
dark with a PALE FACE

Paul turns around in the hallway slowly raising the
knife in his hand He moves in the direction of this
bedroom

INT DAVISON MANSION - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Paul moves into the guest bedroom wielding the knife in
front of him

The room appears empty but the closet door is AJAR
Paul quietly walks to the closet door He pulls it open

The closet is mostly empty On the floor are a bunch of
ENERGY BAR WRAPPERS and an almost empty bottle of water

Paul’s eyes widen as he sees this

Behind Paul the door to the bedroom MOVES SILENTLY The
FOX-MASKED MAN steps out from behind it

Paul does not notice He shifts some hanging clothes to
the side checking to make sure nothing else is in the
closet

THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM GO OUT

Paul spins around He is alone in the dark bedroom

Paul hurries towards the hallway

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT- CONTINUOUS

Erin makes her way through the dark basement using a
small FLASHLIGHT on her key chain to illuminate her path

Erin stops under a bare light bulb that hangs from the
ceiling from a cord She pulls on the chain attached the
bulb The basement remains dark

Erin shines her flashlight beam around the basement
searching the walls for anything resembling a circuit
box She frowns seeing nothing

Abruptly the light bulb above Erin turns ON
illuminating the basement room

OMITTED

INT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING

In the dark hallway Paul pushes the master switch in the
circuit breaker box back to ON

As Paul does so a DARK FIGURE quickly moves up behind
him silhouetted in the light

Paul spins around to face the figure brandishing his
knife

The figure behind him is FELIX Zee is crouched behind
Felix also holding a knife looking scared

FELIX
Whoa dad

Paul speaks quickly
PAUL
One of them’s in the bedroom They were
here for days watching us while we
slept This wasn’t a random attack

FELIX
Okay okay Calm down
INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Erin blinks in the sudden light of the basement staring
at the glowing light bulb above her with surprise
Erin moves to exit the basement then notices a TOOL
BENCH against one wall in the lit basement room Several
tools are scattered across the bench

Erin quickly moves towards this

INT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING

Paul continues speaking rapidly to Felix and Zee A
shadow shifts in the hall behind him

PAUL
Don’t you understand Felix Our family’s
being targeted by someone This isn’t-

Felix eyes wide looks over Paul’s shoulder Paul
seeing this stops speaking

The FOX-MASKED MAN is standing right behind Paul in the
hallway

Paul turns around raising his knife just as the man
raises his MACHETE

The fox-masked man swings and SLICES the blade down into
the side of Paul’s neck

Paul dazed takes a step back and the blade SLIDES OUT
through the front of his neck

BRIGHT RED BLOOD PAINTS THE WALL to Paul’s side He
stumbles and turns SPRAYING FELIX in the face with the
blood shooting from his severed carotid artery

Paul falls to the floor his hands pressed to the side of
his neck Blood begins pooling from between his fingers

Felix stares down at the twitching Paul He then looks
blankly up at the fox-masked man Felix’s face is covered
with blood

FELIX
Really You had to do that right in front
of me

The fox-masked man hesitates then reaches up under his
mask and removes an iPod earbud from one of his ears
Tinny loud HIP HOP MUSIC is audible blaring from it

FOX-MASKED MAN
What

FELIX
You know what Never mind

Felix looks back down at Paul Paul is staring up at
Felix his eyes wide with horror

Paul’s mouth opens as if he is trying to speak but
cannot He reaches out with one hand to clutch at Felix’s
pants leg leaving bloody smears on Felix’s jeans

Felix quickly takes a step away Paul’s hand falls to the
floor His fingers twitch then he dies

Felix looks down at Paul’s still body then quickly looks
away He slowly raises one hand to his face Zee is
watching him with wide eyes

ZEE
You okay
FELIX
Yeah I I just got blood in my eye

thanks a lot I need to get washed up
Felix abruptly exits the hallway heading into one of the
bedrooms leaving the fox-masked man and Zee facing each
other in the hallway Paul’s bloody corpse between them

The fox-masked man nods at Zee awkwardly

FOX-MASKED MAN
Hey Zee

ZEE
Hey Tom

FOX-MASKED MAN
How’s it going

Zee shrugs

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Erin makes her way towards the basement stairs now
holding a SCREWDRIVER from the tool bench out in front of
her like a weapon

Abruptly FOOTSTEPS are audible above her head like
someone in boots walking slowly The floorboards creak
directly above Erin

Erin stops moving listening

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

On the floor above Erin the lamb-masked man walks slowly
from the entryway into the front room carrying his
CROSSBOW

The lamb-masked man looks slowly around the room His
eyes move over Tarig and Kelly’s corpses then stop when
he sees the dead body of the man who was wearing the
tiger mask

The lamb-masked man slowly walks over to the corpse of
the tiger-masked man

The lamb-masked man tucks his crossbow into a holster on
his back He kneels next to the tiger-masked man and
gently touches his face turning his head to one side
revealing the body’s shattered skull

A sound somewhere between a MOAN and a SOB emerges from
behind the lamb mask

The lamb-masked man is still for a moment then he
SCREAMS with rage and grabs the tiger-masked man’s AXE up
from the floor

Rising to his feet with a HOWL he SMASHES the axe DOWN
on the dining table SPLITTING the table top in half

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT STEPS - CONTINUOUS

Erin is crouched on the basement steps just outside the
closed door leading up the first floor of the house She
can hear the sounds of the lamb-masked man SCREAMING AND
SMASHING from the other side of the door

A few miscellaneous objects are nearby Erin including a
kite and some string She tightly grips the screwdriver
she is holding her knuckles white

A warded lock keyhole shines a thin ray of light onto
Erin’s wide eyes but she can see nothing outside

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

The lamb-masked man still SCREAMING storms into the
entryway wielding the AXE

With a muffled HOWL he swings the axe blade into a lamp
SHATTERING IT

The lamb-masked man abruptly goes silent breathing
heavily his shoulders heaving as he holds the axe in
both hands He lowers his head as if listening for
something

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT STEPS - CONTINUOUS

Erin still positioned just inside the basement door is
quiet holding her breath Outside the door the sound of
the lamb-masked man’s panting is just barely audible
Erin frowning peers out through the keyhole
Immediately the lamb mask FILLS ERIN’S VISION The lamb-
masked man is on the other side of the keyhole staring

in at her His visible eye is wide and insane

Erin and the lamb-masked man both SCREAM at the same
time His scream is one of fury

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

The lamb-masked man grabs onto the doorknob with one hand
and tries to yank the basement door open Encountering
resistance he SNARLS WITH RAGE

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT STEPS - CONTINUOUS

On the other side of the door Erin has the doorknob
grasped with both hands one knee raised and BRACED

against the door frame

Erin strains with all her physical power keeping the
door shut

The next moment the AXE BLADE BURSTS through the wooden
door directly in front of Erin’s face

She SCREAMS again

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

The lamb-masked man is CHOPPING into the basement door
swinging the axe again and again creating a hole in the
door’s center

Erin’s face is visible through the hole She is still
SCREAMING

Behind the lamb-masked man Drake stumbles out from the
dining room holding his bloody shoulder and looking
confused

The lamb-masked man does not notice Drake Drake regards
the man’s back hazily watching him chop into the
basement door

DRAKE
Hey

The lamb-masked man stops turns and looks at Drake
Drake for the first time sees the man’s mask

Drake takes a slow step away He holds up one hand

DRAKE (CONTD)
Whoa

The lamb-masked man is entirely focused on Drake now He
takes a step towards Drake raising his axe

Drake takes another step backward stumbles and FALLS
onto his back trying to scramble away The lamb-masked
Man moves quickly to stand over Drake lifting his axe

The basement door swings open and Erin rushes out the
SCREWDRIVER thrust in front of her

She stabs the point of the screwdriver into the lamb-
masked man’s BACK above his holstered crossbow She jabs
the screwdriver in deep leaving it sticking out of his
back

With a roar of pain and surprise the lamb-masked man
drops the axe turns and KNOCKS ERIN DOWN with a flailing
arm

The lamb-masked man spins reaching behind his shoulder
to grab the CROSSBOW on his back He grasps the butt of
the crossbow and tries to pull it up then SCREAMS WITH
PAIN

The screwdriver jammed between the man’s shoulder blades
is PINNING THE CROSSBOW into its holster Every time he
tries to lift the crossbow it CATCHES on the screwdriver
handle

The lamb-masked man makes a noise like a SOB OF
FRUSTRATION He turns away from Erin to face Drake

Drake rising shakily to his feet has the AXE in both
hands He is facing the lamb-masked man

The lamb-masked man stares at Drake makes a noise
somewhere between a laugh and a snarl then TURNS AND
RUNS out through the front door the screwdriver still
stuck in his back

Drake and Erin stare at each other Erin gets up off the
floor propping herself against the wall

Drake clears his throat then gestures unhappily behind
himself with the axe

DRAKE (CONTD)
I um I woke up in the dining room

ERIN
Yeah you blacked out I put you there to
hide you

DRAKE
Oh
(pause)
Thanks

ERIN
You’re welcome

Drake looks around the shattered entryway Aimee’s body
is on the floor covered by the sheet

DRAKE
Where’s Kelly

Erin looks at Drake then looks to the front room
Kelly’s body is lying on the floor near the window
blocked from sight by the wreckage of the dining room
table

Erin stares at the table for a moment then quickly looks
back at Drake

ERIN
Um We don’t know

DRAKE
Do you think she got away

ERIN
(awkwardly )
I hope so

Drake slumps against the wall He sets the axe down and
grabs his shoulder
DRAKE
But you don’t think so

Erin looks hesitant again glancing in the direction
Kelly’s body

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Erin begins to answer Drake but is interrupted when
Felix and Zee emerge on the stairwell

FELIX
Are you guys okay What’s going on

Erin and Drake stare at Felix

FELIX (CONTD)
We heard noises so we stayed upstairs
What happened

ERIN
One of them came in and attacked us I
stabbed him and he ran away

Felix blinks

FELIX
You stabbed him

ERIN
Yeah With a screwdriver

FELIX
Do you think you might have killed him

ERIN
No It didn’t get past the muscle It
just hurt him Was there anyone upstairs

FELIX
We didn’t find anyone Whoever was there
couldve climbed out the window

ERIN
Where’s your dad

FELIX
He uh He needed to lie down

Erin nods sympathetically

of

ERIN
He’s probably just as safe up there as he
would be down here honestly We need to
get together some weapons before they
come back

ZEE
How many are there

Zee seems on the verge of panic
ERIN

We shouldn’t make any assumptions but
there have to be at least two more of

them

ZEE
Maybe they’re gone Maybe you scared them
off

ERIN

Maybe Let’s not count on it I saw some
tools we can use in the basement

Erin heads down into the basement followed by the
staggering Drake

Felix and Zee exchange a look Felix shrugs They head
down into the basement after Drake and Erin

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Once at the bottom of the basement steps Erin heads
straight over to the tool bench Drake stumbling behind
her

As Felix and Zee come down the stairs Erin gathers up
some SCRAPS OF WOOD mostly flat pieces She also pockets
a SCREW HOOK

ERIN
Zee can you help me with these This is
enough to get started

Erin hands the wood over to Zee who holds it with both
arms Erin grabs a hammer and a box of THREE INCH NAILS
from the bench She addresses Felix and Drake

ERIN (CONTD)
Grab anything sharp or heavy that might
make a good weapon But don’t stay down
here long We need to be up where there
are windows

(MORE)

ERIN (CONTD)
(to Zee)
You come up with me

Zee follows Erin back upstairs carrying the wood
leaving Felix and Drake alone in the basement

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Upstairs Erin pulls the blanket that is covering Tarig’s
corpse over so that it also covers Kelly’s bloody body
Blood immediately begins soaking through the blanket over
Kelly’s head

Erin looks up Zee holding the wood in her arms is
watching her Erin blinks

ERIN
Drake doesn’t need to see her like that
Here give me one of those

Erin takes a piece of wood from Zee and braces it against
the wall She then hammers a nail all the way through the
wood so that the point protrudes from the other end

Erin looks up at Zee who is still watching her intently

ERIN (CONT’D)
See like that Just make sure the nail
goes all the way through

ZEE
Okay

Zee takes the hammer from Erin looks at her then
gingerly takes a nail and hammers it through the wood

ZEE (CONTD)
Like that

ERIN
Yeah that’s good Keep them a few inches
apart not too close together but don’t
leave any big spaces either Do as many
as you can

Zee nods quickly then hesitates
ZEE
Can I ask you something How did you

learn this stuff

ERIN
What do you mean
ZEE
You’re good at fighting I wouldn’t have
expected that from just meeting you

ERIN
Oh well I haven’t even told Crispian
about this yet but I had kind of a weird
childhood I uh grew up on a
survivalist compound

ZEE
You grew up on a survivalist compound

ERIN
Yeah

ZEE
(thinking)
That’s a good answer

ERIN
To hear my mom tell it my dad got kind
of paranoid when I was born He was
convinced that the world was going to run
out of resources in a matter of years
Not just oil and coal and the stuff
everyone talks about but like food and
potable water He found a lot of guys who
agreed with him and we all moved out to
some land in the outback Basically if
things got too overpopulated even out
there he wanted me to be able to take of
myself I left for the States with my mom
when I was fifteen but I learned a lot
beforehand

ZEE
Wow That’s crazy

ERIN
Yeah I guess so

Erin shrugs and turns away Zee stares after her

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Drake picks up a hatchet and tests the blade against his
thumb He sets it down shaking his head

DRAKE
Too dull

Behind Drake Felix is looking around the tool bench as
if searching for something He is wearing a pair of cloth
WORK GLOVES

DRAKE (CONTD)
So Crispian’s gone too

FELIX
Yeah He ran out right after Kelly did

DRAKE
But no one’s heard anything from them If
they’re okay

Felix looks over at Drake as if puzzled Drake is staring
down at a rubber mallet in his hand

DRAKE (CONTD)
I think I should go looking for them I
can’t just wait around here wondering if
she’s okay

FELIX
Huh Kelly’s dead man

Drake looks up and stares at Felix blankly

DRAKE
What

FELIX
Kelly’s dead They threw her body in
through a window upstairs She’s up there
on the floor You didn’t know that

Drake looks stunned He puts a hand on the table as if to
support himself

DRAKE
No I Erin said she hadn’t come
back

FELIX

Oh um Well I guess that’s a matter of
perspective But her body’s definitely
upstairs She got killed Erin was
probably just trying to be nice about it

Drake just stares at Felix

DRAKE
No

FELIX
Yeah Totally

Drake starts to speak then his face crumples and he
begins QUIETLY CRYING He puts one hand over his face
sobbing into it

DRAKE
No Kelly

Felix regards Drake uncomfortably for a moment He looks
down at the work gloves on his hands awkwardly

FELIX
Hey um I’m sorry Drake Look I
thought you knew I mean I know you
cared about her a lot

Drake looks up at Felix with sudden fury His face is
streaked with tears

DRAKE
Oh and what would you know about that
you spoiled little shit Have you ever
loved anything else in your selfish life
If mom and dad-

Drake abruptly stops speaking grunting slightly He
looks down at his chest

Felix has STABBED DRAKE IN THE CHEST with a WOOD KNIFE
Blood flows out from around the blade

FELIX
I’m sorry

Drake gapes at Felix The wood knife is jutting out of
his upper chest

Felix tries to yank the wood knife out to stab Drake
again but encounters resistance the blade is lodged in
Drake’s ribs

Felix with a SOB of frustration grabs a METAL FILE off
the table and JAMS THE SHARP END into Drake’s stomach

Drake is still standing tearfully staring at Felix He
opens his mouth gasping

DRAKE
What-

Felix whimpers running his hands over tools on the
bench

He begins GRABBING TOOLS AT RANDOM and STABBING DRAKE
with them leaving each tool imbedded in Drake’s flesh

Felix stabs Drake with SEVERAL MORE TOOLS panting his
shoulders shaking

Drake stares down at the implements protruding from his
chest The front of his shirt is soaked with blood

DRAKE (CONTD)
Felix

FELIX
(crying)
Would you just die already This is hard
enough for me

Felix picks a wooden ICE PICK up off the table and
PLUNGES IT into Drake’s chest right over his heart

Drake looks down snorts and BLOOD BURSTS from his
nostrils He pitches back onto the floor and does not
move

Felix turns away from Drake’s body and takes a long slow
breath He carefully removes his bloody work gloves and
looks at his clean hands as if trying to regain his
composure

Felix takes two deep breaths then puts his hands over
his face and starts WEEPING

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

In the front room kneeling by Tarig Kelly and the tiger-
masked man’s bodies Erin is examining the floor beneath
one of the windows She has a dark CLOTH NAPKIN from the
dining table in one hand

Behind Erin Zee approaches holding a board with nails
driven through it She wields the board in both hands
like a weapon

Zee moistens her lips with her tongue looking at Erin’s
back Her hands are TREMBLING slightly

Erin turns back and glances at Zee Zee stops moving

ERIN
You finish that one

ZEE
(faltering)
Yeah

ERIN
Cool Might not be a bad idea to do at
least one more I’m going to go check on
their father upstairs while you do that
When the guys come up make sure they
have some rope or something

ZEE
I um You probably shouldn’t go up
there He might be sleeping

Erin picking up the meat tenderizer MALLET from the
floor rises to her feet and moves towards the stairs

ERIN
I won’t wake him up

ZEE
I’ll go up I’1l do it

Erin looks back at Zee strangely

ERIN
If you’re scared of being alone Zee go
down and check on Drake and Felix See
what’s taking them

Zee hesitates staring up at Erin Erin’s expression
softens

ERIN (CONTD)
Or you can come up with me if you want
But it’ll only take a second

ZEE
(awkwardly )
No That’s okay I’1ll do another board

Erin nods and heads for the stairs Zee stares after her
then crosses into the entryway where she unlocks the
front door

INT DAVISON MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Erin enters the upstairs hallway holding the metal
mallet She immediately notices the dark patch of BLOOD
on the wall and floor at the end of the hallway Paul’s
body is nowhere to be seen

Frowning Erin cautiously moves to the bloody end of the
hallway towards the master bedroom She lifts her mallet
in front of her

INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING

Erin steps slowly inside the master bedroom A thick
trail of SMEARED BLOOD on the carpet leads within

Paul’s BODY is slumped facedown on the floor near the

foot of the bed Aubrey’s corpse is still on the bed

beneath the bloody writing on the wall The machete is
now missing from her head

Erin moves further into the room staring

ERIN
Jesus

Behind Erin the fox-masked man appears in the bedroom
doorway machete in hand

The fox-masked man regards Erin as she slowly moves to
check Paul’s body

Erin carefully rolls Paul over His dead glassy eyes
stare up at her

Erin takes a step back then turns around to face the FOX-
MASKED MAN who is still standing in the doorway
blocking her exit

Erin freezes

The fox-masked man takes a step forward raising his
machete

Erin looks down at the mallet in her hand then looks at
the fox-masked man and his machete She THROWS HER MALLET
at him

The mallet flips through the air and hits the fox-masked
man IN THE FACE He hunches forward with a yell of pain
and surprise

Erin moves to run past the fox-masked man but with an
angry grunt he straightens up and lifts his machete
again BLOCKING HER PATH

Erin hesitates then turns around takes two running
steps and JUMPS OUT THE BEDROOM WINDOW SMASHING THROUGH
THE GLASS her arms up to protect her head and neck
EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Erin falls through the air and LANDS HARD on the grass
broken glass raining all around her She immediately goes
into a ROLL to lessen her impact coming up crouched on
her feet

Erin sways for a moment trying to catch her breath

A small group of trees line the outskirts of the house’s
yard Erin staggers towards these trees LIMPING BADLY
INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The fox-masked man standing in front of the broken
window watches Erin limp over to the trees and disappear
into the darkness

He regards the ground beneath the window as if thinking
it over

EXT DAVISON MANSION - SIDE YARD - NIGHT

Erin reaching the shelter of the trees quickly looks
back at the broken window where the fox-masked man is

visible framed by the bedroom’s light

Erin sees the fox-masked man turn away disappearing from
the window exiting the bedroom

ERIN
Shit Zee

Erin looks down at her leg

A SHARD OF BROKEN GLASS is protruding from one of Erin’s
thighs

ERIN (CONT’D)
Ah Fuck

Erin considers then takes hold of the piece of broken
glass

Moving slowly but without hesitation Erin begins to PULL
OUT the shard of broken glass

It is embedded deeply in her leg An inch of bloody glass
emerges then another inch before the pointed end of the
shard is free BLOOD FLOWS FREELY from the wound

ERIN (CONT’D)
Ha Whoo

Erin lets the bloody piece of glass drop to the ground in
front of her She glances down at it then stops

A BLOODY SCREWDRIVER rests on the dirt next to the base
of the tree nearest to her It is the same screwdriver
that she stabbed the lamb-masked man with

Erin freezes Slowly she turns and looks behind her
into the darkness of the trees

Nothing is visible

Erin takes her keys out of her pocket Her keychain is a
SMALL FLASHLIGHT

Positioning her hand over the bulb of the flashlight so

its light will not give her position away Erin switches
the light ON She then slowly spreads her fingers apart
allowing a DIM RAY OF LIGHT to shine on the trees around
her

The beam immediately falls upon the tall LAMB-MASKED MAN
who is standing between two large trees watching her He
has his CROSSBOW loosely aimed at her

As soon as the light falls on his face the lamb-masked
man RAISES THE CROSSBOW pulling its TRIGGER

Erin GASPS AND DUCKS DOWN QUICKLY dropping her keychain
The trees and the lamb-masked man go dark

A CROSSBOLT BOLT IMBEDS ITSELF INTO THE TREE behind her
just over her head

The lamb-masked man snarls reaching back into his
holster for another ARROW striding forward towards Erin

Erin turns and RUNS towards the Davison mansion Her
wounded leg is not fully operational and she drags it as
she lurches towards the front yard

EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Just as Erin reaches the front door to the Davison
mansion the LAMB-MASKED MAN appears behind her coming
around the corner of the house holding his now-loaded
crossbow He is also limping badly clutching his lower
abdomen with his free hand

Erin does not look behind her She opens the front door
steps inside and slams it closed
INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Erin quickly locks the DEADBOLT on the front door then
turns around to survey the room

Zee Felix and the fox-masked man are nowhere to be seen
Erin staggers into the front room

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Erin enters the front room searching for something Her

eyes fall on the BOARDS WITH NAILS through them that Zee
created Two boards are resting on the floor

EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

The lamb-masked man reaches the front door still
carrying his loaded crossbow He tries the front door It
is locked

With a GROWL of frustration the man moves over to the
shattered front room window Inside the room is dark
Nothing is moving within

The lamb-masked man can see the body of the tiger-masked
man inside on the floor He stiffens at the sight of it

The lamb-masked man starts to step into the room then
looks down inside the window

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

A BOARD with NAILS STICKING UP out of it is resting on
the floor a foot or so away from the wall right beneath
the sole of the lamb-masked man’s shoe It is plainly
visible

The lamb-masked man stops moving and EXHALES sighing
looking down at the board with nails beneath his foot He
adjusts his foot so that he is stepping straight down
near the wall where the floor is dark and shadowed
Nothing is visible there He shifts his weight forward

The man’s foot comes down hard on the SECOND BOARD WITH
NAILS which is hidden under a dark cloth napkin just
beneath the windowsill The napkin draped over it
disguises it completely from sight

The nails sink deeply into the sole of his shoe PIERCING
UP THROUGH HIS FOOT and out through the top of his
sneaker

As the nails STAB THROUGH his foot the lamb-masked man’s
FINGER involuntarily TIGHTENS on the TRIGGER of his
crossbow

An arrow SHOOTS from the crossbow straight into the HEAD
of the tiger-masked man’s CORPSE a few feet away It
KNOCKS his head to the side the arrow protruding from
the side of his bloody forehead

The lamb-masked man frozen lets his empty crossbow fall
from his hand He tilts his head up to the ceiling He
takes a deep breath then another A soft WHINING NOISE
OF PAIN comes from behind his mask

The man breathes for another second then reaches down
gripping his leg He slowly starts to pull it upward off
the nails

INT DAVISON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Felix Zee and the fox-masked man are gathered around the
broken bedroom window looking outside

FELIX
Well she can’t have fucking gone far
right We spread out now search the
backyards and streets We’ll get her

A masculine SCREAM OF PAIN comes from downstairs They
all three exchange a glance

FELIX (CONTD)
Would you mind checking on that

The fox-masked man hesitates
FELIX (CONTD)
I believe this is what I’m paying for you
for

The fox-masked man nods quickly and exits

Felix sits down on the bed next to Aubrey’s dead body
his head in his hands

FELIX (CONTD)
What a fucking disaster

Zee quickly straddles him on the bed wrapping her arms
around him comforting Felix exhaling returns her
embrace holding her tightly

Zee begins biting the side of Felix’s neck Felix sighs

FELIX (CONTD)
I’m not really in the mood right now
Zee

ZEE
Come on I can make it really quick

Zee on top of Felix lifts up her shirt Small-chested
she is not wearing a bra

ZEE (CONTD)
I want to fuck you on a bed right next to
your dead mom

FELIX
What No

Felix lifts Zee off of him and moves away to stand by the
bed Zee leans back against Aubrey’s legs

FELIX (CONTD)
Why would you even say something like
that

ZEE
(disappointed)
You never want to do anything
interesting

FELIX
I I don’t think that’s a fair
criticism

Zee sits up eagerly

ZEE
Fuck me next to your dead mom then

FELIX
This conversation is over

Felix exits the room

Zee sitting on the bed despondently rubs at the crotch
of her jeans for a moment then gives an exasperated
sigh She pulls her shirt back down and follows Felix out
into the hallway

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Felix moves into the front room The fox-masked man is
helping the lamb-masked man pull the board with nails on
it off of his foot

The nails slide out through the sole of the lamb-masked
man’s shoe He makes a hissing sound as the fox-masked
man tosses the board aside

The lamb-masked man sits back on the floor with a moan of
pain He removes his sneaker and upends it BLOOD POURS
OUT onto the floor

FELIX
Whoa hey Don’t do that

The lamb-masked man looks up at Felix

FELIX (CONTD)
You don’t want your DNA here man
INT DAVISON MANSION - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Erin is crouched behind the curtains in the dining room
listening She is holding very still breathing softly

Erin reacts to the sound of Felix’s voice staring
straight ahead in the dark
INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

The lamb masked man glares up at Felix his eyes gleaming
behind the mask’s holes

LAMB-MASKED MAN
I’ll clean it up later Just like the
rest of this fucking mess

Tossing his perforated sneaker to one side the lamb-
masked man rises leaning heavily to keep his weight off
his wounded foot

Felix walks forward into the room Zee appears on the
stairs behind him

FELIX
You say that like it’s my fault

The lamb-masked man grunts
FELIX (CONTD)
Listen so we’re perfectly clear I just
had to kill my own brother because you
guys keep getting beat up by some girl I
had to stab my brother You were supposed
to do that And the police could be on
the way here right now Did you even take
care of everyone outside

With a grunt of pain the lamb-masked man takes a
dragging step towards Felix His eyes are fierce

LAMB-MASKED MAN
You want to talk about brothers

The lamb-masked man points to the tiger-masked man on the
floor

LAMB-MASKED MAN (CONT’D)
That’s my brother lying dead right
there And unlike you I liked my
brother

Felix takes this in regarding the tiger-masked man’s
corpse with vague curiosity

FELIX
I’m sorry I didn’t know that I mean I
knew you guys served together I didn’t
know you were related though
(pause)
Did you shoot him in the head

In a swift movement the lamb-masked man grabs Felix by
the front of his neck and SLAMS him against the wall
holding him there

Felix struggles for breath The fox-masked man steps
forward as if to intervene then stops when the lamb-
masked man looks at him

The lamb-masked man returns his attention to Felix
LAMB-MASKED MAN
I’m just trying to think of reasons I

shouldn’t kill you

Felix struggles to speak Zee is watching this all take
place with interest

FELIX
Pay you more

LAMB-MASKED MAN
What’s that

Felix cannot speak The lamb-masked man releases him
Felix slumps forward sucking in air He gasps

FELIX
You kill me you get nothing You pull
this off I’1l give you four hundred
thousand

The lamb-masked man regards Felix

FELIX (CONTD)

I was going to give you two right But
you should have your brother’s share
That’s only fair

The lamb-masked man looks over at his dead brother Felix
speaks quickly

FELIX (CONTD)
Plus I’1l throw in an extra hundred
Each If you can finish this So that’s a
half million for you

(to the fox-masked man)
Three hundred thousand for you I won’t
be able to pay you until my inheritance
comes through But I’1l have it soon We
just need to finish this

The lamb-masked man looks over at the fox-masked man who
shrugs

FOX-MASKED MAN
We’ve come this far

The lamb-masked man glances at Zee who is watching
silently then jabs Felix in the chest with a finger

LAMB-MASKED MAN
You two better be getting enough money to
pay us

FELIX
Would I be doing this if I wasn’t

The lamb-masked man nods and steps away Suddenly an
electronic BEEPING noise comes from the DINING ROOM

Felix Zee and the two masked killers all turn to look
in this direction of this sound

INT DAVISON MANSION - DINING - NIGHT

Behind the curtain Erin fumbles frantically for her
BEEPING cell phone trying to silence it She takes it
quickly from her pocket Its screen is glowing

A notice reads “MESSAGE SENT”

Erin holds her breath silently slipping her phone back
into her pocket She looks up

The curtains in front of her are YANKED OPEN The FOX-
MASKED MAN stands in front of Erin staring at her He is
holding his machete in his right hand

Erin promptly PUNCHES the fox-masked man in the face
cracking his mask

FOX-MASKED MAN
Ow

The fox-masked man takes a step back startled and Erin
RUNS PAST HIM fleeing the dining room

EXT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Erin runs around the fox-masked man into the entryway

Felix Zee and the lamb-masked man are all in the front

room staring at her

Without even glancing at them Erin RUNS for the library

There is a moment of confused hesitation then Felix runs
after Erin

FELIX
Get her

Zee and the fox-masked man follow Felix The lamb-masked
man also awkwardly gives pursuit limping after the
others He reaches the entryway and picks up the AXE from
the floor headed for the library

EXT DAVISON MANSION - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Erin runs from the back door in the library onto the
back patio moving quickly

Once outside Erin immediately turns and leaps through
the shattered window of the front room jumping back INTO
THE HOUSE She disappears from view within

A moment later Felix emerges from the back door
followed by Zee and the fox-masked man Not seeing Erin
anywhere they run into the darkness of the backyard in
pursuit

Staggering slowly behind them the lamb-masked man
stumbles out onto the back patio unable to put any
weight on his wounded foot He comes to a stop just
outside the door examining his injured foot and cursing
softly

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Inside the front room Erin has grabbed one of the BOARDS
WITH NAILS driven through it

Gripping the board Erin takes off running for the rear
of the house

INT DAVISON MANSION - LIBRARY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Erin races through the entryway into the library where
the lamb-masked man is standing out on the back porch

EXT DAVISON MANSION - BACKYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The lamb-masked man looks out into the darkness of the
backyard Felix Zee and the fox-masked man are nowhere
to be seen searching for Erin in the distance

Hearing footsteps behind him the lamb-masked man turns
around Erin is rushing towards him through the back
door raising the board with nails driven through it over
her head

The lamb-masked man flinches in surprise

LAMB-MASKED MAN
Hey what-—

As Erin SWINGS THE BOARD DOWN at the lamb-masked man’s
head he raises one hand defensively

The nails in the board go through the palm of his hand
and then down into his scalp NAILING HIS HAND TO HIS
HEAD

The lamb-masked man staggers back dropping his axe
using his free hand to try to pry the board off his head
and pinned hand He drops to his knees on the porch
struggling to free his arm
Erin grabs the axe up off the floor Straightening she
SWINGS IT SIDEWAYS

The blade hits the man’s exposed neck DECAPITATING HIM

The lamb-masked man’s severed head falls forward then
SWINGS DOWN by his side as his arm extends hitting the
floor His head is still attached to his hand by the
board

The man’s body falls on its side his free hand falling
forward to land on top of his severed head

When he comes to rest it looks like he is holding his
lamb-masked severed head in both hands LIKE A BALL

Erin blinks at this odd sight She then turns and runs
back into the house carrying the axe

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Erin rushes into the entryway She yanks open the
basement door and grabs the folded KITE inside along
with its spool of KITE STRING

Erin then takes a wooden chair and drags it over to the
front door She removes the screw hook from her pocket

and begins DRIVING it into the ceiling right ABOVE THE

DOOR

EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Zee Felix and the fox-masked man stand in front of the
Davison vacation house near the street looking around
for Erin The entire road is dark and empty

FELIX
The cops could be driving here right now
for all we know What if they come across
her running down the road

FOX-MASKED MAN
Calm down

FELIX
Why should I calm down This entire
situation’s out of control We don’t even
know what’s going on

FOX-MASKED MAN
Try to think positive okay
(to Zee)
(MORE)

FOX-MASKED MAN (CONTD)
You guys look out here She’s hurt She’s
not faster than you Stick to the road
If you don’t see her head back here

Zee nods

FELIX
Where are you going

FOX-MASKED MAN
Back into the house to check on Craig and
see if she doubled back on us

FELIX
Why would she do that

FOX-MASKED MAN
(shrugs)
It’s what I’d do

The fox-masked man turns away towards the house

FELIX
Hey Give us the crossbow

The fox-masked man turns back

FELIX (CONTD)
We don’t have any weapons

The fox-masked man looks down at the crossbow He LOCKS A
BOLT into it then proffers it to Felix

FOX-MASKED MAN
You know how to use this

Felix takes the crossbow hefting it

FELIX
I pull the trigger arrow shoots Right

FOX-MASKED MAN
Yeah Be careful with that There’s two
more bolts on the base there That’s
three shots got it You see her you be
sure to aim carefully

FELIX
Of course

Felix takes off running down the street

The fox-masked man looks at Zee who smiles at him and
runs after Felix
The fox-masked man sighs and walks up to the house

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Erin standing on the chair finishes tying a piece of
string attached to the ceiling with a SLIPKNOT She steps
off the chair to admire her work

Using the hanging hole in the bottom of its handle as a
fulcrum Erin has SUSPENDED THE AXE FROM THE CEILING with
kite string

The string is attached the door handle then tied to the
door’s deadbolt lock The other end of the string winds
up looping from the blade of the axe to the ceiling’s
light fixture The base of the axe is held by the SCREW
HOOK and the back of the blade is braced with a BRICK

So that

If someone opens the front door the slipknots will pull
tight come undone and the weighted axe will swing down
into their face

Erin smiles satisfied at this set-up She then looks
towards the front room as the FOX-MASKED MAN steps in
through the broken window

They stare at each other

ERIN
Shit

Erin runs for the basement door

INT DAVISON MANSION - BASEMENT - NIGHT
Erin races down the basement steps

Reaching the bottom of the stairs she grabs a LOG off a
woodpile In a swift movement she swings it up towards
the BARE LIGHT BULB hanging from the ceiling BREAKING
THE BULB

The basement goes completely dark
A moment later the fox-masked man appears at the top of

the basement steps holding the FIRE POKER He is
illuminated by light from the hallway

The fox-masked man flicks the light switch on the wall
off and on Nothing happens
He chuckles

FOX-MASKED MAN
I’ve got pretty good night vision you
know Not a lot of streetlights out in
the desert Just the moon and the stars

The fox-masked man begins slowly making his way down the
stairs into the dark basement

He reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns to survey
the dark basement listening carefully

Suddenly a PALE LIGHT FLASHES briefly illuminating the
room

Erin is standing on the other side of the room holding
out her DIGITAL CAMERA using its FLASH to see

The light dies and the basement is dark again except for
the DIM LIGHT of the camera’s VIEW SCREEN

On the screen is the image of the FOX-MASKED MAN on the
other side of the room facing towards Erin the photo
she just took

The fox-masked man seeing the light of the camera screen
and hearing motion behind it CHUCKLES again He cannot
see Erin but he can see the dim light moving slightly
then going still He begins slowly making his way towards
it

The camera FLASH GOES AGAIN This time the image on the
screen is of the man’s MASKED FACE right in FRONT OF THE
CAMERA

With a YELL the fox-masked man JABS THE FIRE POKER above
the camera where Erin’s face should be Instead he hits
the WALL

A moment later the fox-masked man GRUNTS as he is hit
from behind

The FLASH goes again filling the room with WHITE LIGHT

The camera is CLAMPED into a VISE on the TOOL SHELF Its
CAMERA TIMER is on taking photos every ten seconds

The fox-masked man is on his knees Erin standing behind
him BRINGS THE LOG DOWN ON HIS HEAD

The room goes dark The sound of WOOD HITTING FLESH comes
repeatedly

The camera flashes again The fox-masked man is on the
floor in a POOL OF BLOOD His hands spasm trying to
protect his face

Darkness More POUNDING

The camera flashes again

The fox-masked man’s face is a BLOODY PULP smeared
across the concrete floor

Erin is standing in front of the vise reaching for the
camera Her face is SPATTERED WITH BLOOD

The room goes dark again as Erin audibly unlocks the
vise releasing her camera Visible in the dim light from
the screen she makes her way for the stairs panting
from exertion

INT DAVISON MANSION - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Erin emerges from the basement She looks around The
house is quiet

Erin heads for the front room

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Reaching the front room Erin picks up a knife from the
floor She then straightens and turns towards the window
to climb outside

A CROSSBOW ARROW hits Erin in the SIDE OF HER CHEST
knocking her to the floor

EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Felix is crouched in the front yard aiming the crossbow
Zee stands next to him They watch as Erin falls back
inside the house disappearing from view

Felix straightens up looking grimly satisfied

FELIX
How about that First try

Felix hands the crossbow to Zee

FELIX (CONTD)
Go make sure she’s dead okay
Zee nods grinning as Felix heads over towards the
rental car parked in the driveway

Zee walks through the front yard to the Davison vacation
house strapping ANOTHER BOLT into the crossbow She
reaches the broken front room window and looks inside

Erin’s body is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN Tarig’s corpse is the
only one on the floor

The tiger-masked man’s body is also missing Zee does not
appear to notice this

ZEE
Oh you’ve got to be kidding me
(calling out)
Felix She’s alive

Keeping the crossbow in front of her Zee steps through

the shattered window into the house

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

As Zee enters the front room a distant NOISE comes from
the kitchen Zee aims the crossbow towards the entryway
nothing is there

Moving quietly Zee walks into the entryway towards the

kitchen her crossbow in front of her

EXT DAVISON MANSION - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Felix is standing behind the rental car Its trunk is
open He is holding a SIX-CHANNEL CELLULAR JAMMER
basically the size of clock radio He tosses it back in
the trunk

FELIX
(muttering)
What seriously
Felix takes a BUCK KNIFE out of a bag then slams the
trunk shut He walks back to the house FLICKING THE
KNIFE BLADE OPEN
INT DAVISON MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Zee moves inside the kitchen aiming the crossbow around

The kitchen appears empty Zee’s eyes narrow scanning
the darkness

From around the kitchen counter the SILHOUETTE OF A BODY
SLUMPS INTO VIEW seated on the floor

The head turns as if peering towards Zee An ARROW
VISIBLY PROTRUDES from the body’s chest

Zee smiles She immediately takes aim and FIRES
The ARROW HITS the body in its head
Zees smile widens

The body slumps down onto the floor now in clear view
Zee stops smiling

The corpse is that of the TIGER-MASKED MAN

Behind his dead body Erin rises up from behind the
counter facing Zee She is holding a MEAT CLEAVER

ERIN
Hey Zee

Zee quickly scrambles trying to reload the crossbow
Erin rushes towards Zee raising the cleaver

At the last moment Zee realizes she cannot load the
crossbow in time and raises it defensively dropping the
arrow to the floor

Erin swings the cleaver Zee blocks it with the crossbow
The cleaver EMBEDS ITSELF in the wooden stock of the
crossbow

Erin releases the cleaver and GRABS ZEE by her hair
dragging her further into the kitchen

Behind them FELIX appears in the kitchen doorway
holding his knife He sees the two girls struggling

FELIX
Hey

In a swift movement Erin grabs the POT OF OIL off the
stove and FLINGS ITS CONTENTS at Felix splashing him and
half the room with oil

Felix flinches then stares down at himself
FELIX (CONTD)

Huh It’s not hot anymore you dumb
bitch

Felix takes a step forward SLIPS ON THE OIL and falls
catching himself on the counter

Zee HISSES clawing at Erin’s face Erin spins the pot
around in her head on BRINGS IT DOWN on Zee’s head

Zee sprawls to the floor sliding on the slick linoleum
Felix rises to his feet raising his KNIFE

Erin swings a CABINET DOOR open HITTING Felix with it
then grabs a JAR out of the cabinet and throws it at his
head

Felix manages to duck The jar hits the wall behind him
and shatters

Zee leaps on Erin from behind Erin bashes Zee’s head
against the wall and lets her drop to the floor again

Felix’s KNIFE stabs down into Erin’s SHOULDER He
wrenches it out to STAB HER AGAIN in the same place

Erin grabs a GLASS BLENDER off the counter with her
unwounded arm spins and SMASHES IT on Felix’s head
breaking the glass

Felix slumps to the floor and Erin STABS HIM IN THE FACE
with the broken jagged glass of the blender’s top
jamming the BLADES OF ITS BASE into his head

Felix struggles Erin grabs the blender cord and PLUGS IT
into a wall socket

Erin stomps down on the bottom of the blender with her
foot holding it in place and pinning Felix to the
kitchen counter She reaches towards her foot and
SWITCHES THE BLENDER ON

The blender’s blades SPIN BLOOD GUSHING OUT around the
glass as the blender DESTROYS FELIX’S SKULL

Zee seeing this rises up SCREAMING grabbing a ROLLING
PIN

Still holding the blender in Felix’s head with her foot
Erin turns wrenches the knife out of her shoulder and
STABS IT DOWN into the top of Zee’s head

Zee’s eyes roll up and she falls back to the floor DEAD

Felix seated on the floor with the blender drilling into
his head is also obviously DEAD

Erin unplugs the blender from the wall and lets Felix
fall to the floor the blender still stuck in the remains
of his face

Erin is soaked with blood Blood flows from the wounds in
her shoulder and chest

Covering her wounds with one hand Erin starts to limp
out of the kitchen She is pale and looks faint

Erin stops moving when she hears a CELL PHONE RING behind
her

Erin turns back towards Felix’s body His cell phone is
RINGING

Erin carefully kneels down and removes the cell phone
from Felix’s jacket pocket She flips it open and holds
it to one ear

CRISPIAN’S VOICE comes from the phone

CRISPIAN (ON PHONE)
Felix

EXT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Crispian dressed as before makes his way up through the
front yard towards the front room window of his family’s
vacation house He is talking into his smartphone

CRISPIAN
Hey Felix is it all done in there or
what I saw that my signal came back Is
it over

Silence on the other end of the line Crispian sighs
CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Look I know youre pissed at me for not
helping out I just couldn’t do it man
I told you this might happen

Crispian steps into through the front room window

INT DAVISON MANSION - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Crispian avoids the boards with nails on the floor
regarding them with confusion He continues speaking into
the phone

CRISPIAN
Jeez What do you want me to say

The phone disconnects Crispian looks down at it
puzzled

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Felix

Erin steps into the front room holding Felix’s cell
phone In her other hand she has a STEAK KNIFE

Crispian blinks then breaks into a wide smile

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Erin Youre okay

Erin says nothing She lets Felix’s cell phone drop from
her hand to the floor

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Um Where’s Felix

ERIN
I stuck a blender in his head and killed
him
CRISPIAN
Oh
(pause)
Okay

Erin sways on her feet looking weak from blood loss

ERIN
I can’t believe it You were in on it

Crispian shrugs weakly
CRISPIAN
Come on baby You do know how broke I

am right

ERIN
You would have killed me

CRISPIAN
(serious)
No That was never supposed to happen

Crispian takes a step closer to Erin
CRISPIAN (CONTD)
You were supposed to be the witness A
person with a clean record who could
attest that our parents and older
siblings were murdered by unknown
lunatics It was in fact a very
important part of my plan that you be
unharmed We needed someone with no
motive to see what had happened here
Someone other than Zee obviously

Crispian hesitates looking around

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Where is Zee

ERIN
I killed her too

CRISPIAN
Ah Listen I’m sorry things got out of
control How were we supposed to know
that you were um really good at killing
people Which is actually sort of weird
by the way If you’d reacted well
normally my parents and older siblings
would have been killed you would have
been untouched and I’d be rich We’d be
on our way to like a vacation in Paris

Erin regards Crispian with empty eyes

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
There is a silver lining here by the
way I’m now the sole inheritor of my
family’s estate baby We’re talking
millions

Crispian takes another step forward now arm’s length
from Erin

CRISPIAN (CONT’D)
Look regardless of like us or
whatever happens with us it would be
insane to throw that away

Crispian gestures around at the dead bodies that surround
them

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
I mean look at all that would be wasted

Erin stares at him

ERIN
Even if you hadn’t meant to kill me you
must have known I could have died

CRISPIAN
I could have died too

Erin blinks Crispian reaches out hesitantly and puts
his hand on Erin’s uninjured shoulder

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
I understand it might take awhile to make
this up to you But in the meantime I
know you’ve got your student loans How
would five hundred thousand dollars go
towards fixing that problem You could
quit your bartending job just study full-
time You know you hate that job

Erin just stares at Crispian He shakes his head

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
You could have five hundred thousand
within the month Or I go to jail and
you get nothing You go back to counting
every penny And what does that get you
The damage is already done You’re okay
baby You’re alive That’s what matters

Erin looks down at herself She is covered with blood
most of it hers

Crispian nods quickly

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
You’re right You got involved You
should have at least a million At least
Tell me what you need But you could have
one million dollars Think of what that
would mean

Erin looks up at Crispian and smiles Not recognizing the
strangeness of her smile Crispian smiles back

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Hey I promised you I’d come back didn’t
I I always keep my promises baby

In a quick motion Erin raises the steak knife and STABS
CRISPIAN in the side of his neck

Crispian clutches his neck BLOOD GUSHING out around his
fingers He falls forward to his knees staring up at
Erin

Erin raises the bloody knife Crispian tries to speak

CRISPIAN (CONTD)
Why

ERIN
Why the fuck not

Erin stabs Crispian again this time in the eye PIERCING
HIS BRAIN

Blood BURSTS from Erin’s RIGHT SHOULDER with the SOUND OF
A GUNSHOT She is knocked against the wall

Erin slumps to the floor next to Crispian’s dead body
She has been shot in the shoulder In shock she stares
out the window

EXT DAVISON VACATION HOME - NIGHT

A uniformed police officer in his late 20s OFFICER
TRUBIANO stands outside in the front yard holding his
smoking 38 revolver in a firing stance aiming it in
through the window

Behind Officer Trubiano his squad car is visible parked
on the street Its lights are off

Officer Trubiano shouts in at Erin

OFFICER TRUBIANO
Do not move Do you hear me

Erin slumped on the floor inside clearly could not move
even if she wanted to She does not react to the
officer’s words looking out at him blankly

Moving closer to the dining room window Officer Trubiano
looks inside and sees Aimee Kelly and Tarigq’s bodies
His face crumples

door Blood is soaking her left arm and she is breathing
shallowly She blinks slowly focusing her eyes

The doorknob is still attached with a slipknot to the
string leading up to the ceiling

Erin’s eyes widen slightly

quickly to cover Erin Above him the string whips up

from the door frame
