OVER BLACK

JOHNS VOICE
Theres something I want to tell
you

OPEN ON

STAFF SARGEANT JOHN TYREE -- who is in his mid-20’s who has
a shaved head beneath his GREEN BERET and who is completely
unaware that two bullets are seconds away from entering him

John looks around the ramshackled room he’s in then turns and
says something we cannot hear to someone we cannot see

JOHNS VOICE
After I got shot you wanna know the
very first thing that entered my
mind right before I blacked out

A BULLET slices into his left shoulder inches away from his
heart John’s eyes widen but he’s too stunned to cry out

JOHNS VOICE
Coins

Despite the EERIE SILENCE a second BULLET hits him in the
gut and sends him to his knees

His hand flies to his stomach In no time at all his fingers
are coated with blood John falls onto his back His eyes
search the dingy ceiling above him All is still SILENT

Sunlight pours in from a large mortar hole and as John
stares at it the light ENVELOPES THE SCREEN AND --

EVERYTHING GOES WHITE
FADE IN ON
John as a LITTLE BOY standing in front of a sprawling metal
contraption that seems to stretch on and on From his POV it
looks like a Rube Goldberg machine
JOHNS VOICE
Im eight years old again on a tour
of the US Mint listening to the

guide explain how coins are made

The other CHILDREN around John are bored out of their minds
But John is not John is fascinated

ON A BLANKING PRESS --

--as enormous metal coils are fed through a reel that cuts
out individual round discs called blanks
JOHNS VOICE
How they are punched out of sheet
metal

ON AN UPSETTING MILL --

-- which squeezes the edges of the blanks giving them a
slightly raised surface

JOHNS VOICE
How they are rimmed and beveled

ON A COINING PRESS --

-- which actually engraves the blanks

JOHNS VOICE
How they are stamped and cleaned

FINALLY ON A PRESS OPERATOR --

-- who uses a magnifying glass to spot-check the new coins

JOHNS VOICE
And then how each and every coin is
personally examined just in case one
has slipped through with the
slightest imperfection

The operator finds a bad coin and flicks it off the conveyor
belt into a waste funnel

The rest of the coins CLATTER off the belt down into an
automatic counting machine while --

MATCH CUT

BACK TO THE DINGY ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

-- where spent M-16 rounds CLATTER onto the ground making the
exact same noise Now all SOUND can be heard and it is LOUD

Whoever shot John is paying for it dearly Three other GREEN
BERET’S are unloading their ammo

John is still flat on his back still bleeding profusely
still staring up at the ceiling

JOHNS VOICE
Thats what popped into my head

One of the soldiers Staff Sargeant TONY GALLO stops firing
and turns to John kneels over him A vein pops out of his
forehead John desperately tries to make eye contact
JOHNS VOICE
I am a coin in the United States
Army I was minted in the year 1980
I have been punched from sheet metal
I have been stamped and cleaned my
edges have been rimmed and beveled
Tony cuts open John’s fatigues Blood flows freely
JOHNS VOICE
But now I have two small holes in
me and I am no longer in perfect
condition
John looks at his punctured stomach and draws a sharp breath

JOHNS VOICE
I am no longer in perfect condition

He glances up at Tony sees the panic in his face

JOHNS VOICE
I am no longer in perfect condition

John GULPS for air His PUPILS begin to DILATE
He’s fading fast The chaos around him begins to slip away
JOHNS VOICE
So theres something else I want to
tell you before I go
His eyelids flutter He GASPS again
JOHNS VOICE
After I got shot right before
everything went black you wanna
know the very final thing that
entered my mind
And then as John’s eyes finally close --

FADE TO BLACK

JOHNS VOICE
You

FADE IN ON
A WAVE --
As it crashes over John submerging him completely

He closes his eyes Then his surfboard pops back above
water and because John is on top of it he pops up too

He is younger now and he is back in North Carolina But his
head is still shaved

SPRING 2001

Before he can even catch his breath another wave is coming
John positions himself paddles into the wave -- stands up --

ON THE SHORE -- he catches a brief glimpse of TWO GIRLS in
bikinis as they wade into the water --

-- but there’s not time to focus on them -- he’s caught the
wave and rides it towards shore when all of a sudden --

--another SURFER cuts him off -- John has to wipe out to
avoid a collision --

UNDERWATER -- he gets lost in the power of the crashing wave
doesn’t try to fight it lets himself get dragged to shore --

-- until he can finally find his footing He stands up in
waist high water angrily yells out to the other surfer --

JOHN
Hey What the hell--

-- then suddenly realizes he’s only a few yards from the
girls he saw earlier

One’s BLONDE the other is BRUNETTE They’re both knockouts
and they’re both staring at him The Brunette smiles

BRUNETTE GIRL
Nice wave

John wipes the salt out of his mouth

JOHN
Shoulda been

The Brunette’s eyes twinkle but the Blonde rolls hers tugs
at her friend Although the Brunette allows herself to be
pulled away she smiles back at John before she goes

John watches her disappear down the beach while the surfer
that cut John off wades over to him John is tall and
muscular not somebody to mess with and this guy knows it

OTHER SURFER
Sorry bro Didn’t see you there

John turns towards him fast -- the other guy flinches
slightly But John is smiling now too

JOHN
What Oh -- no problem

Then he climbs on his board and paddles back into the ocean
ON THE PIER -- LATER

John leans against the rail drinking a beer watching the
sun set His board is next to him

Nearby he hears GIGGLING -- and when he turns he sees the
same two girls from before walking up the pier They stop 20
feet away or so but they don’t see him because of his board

John peeks over at them for a second thinks

But before he can make a move TWO GUYS in polo shirts walk
up behind the girls They’re good-looking and loud each
with a beer in hand The one in the YELLOW SHIRT wraps his
arms around the Blonde Girl They’re clearly a couple

But John’s focused on the Brunette Girl and he watches with
interest as the guy in the BABY BLUE SHIRT hops up easily on
the rail next to her-- and knocks her tote bag off the edge
It hits the water with a SPLASH

BRUNETTE GIRL
My bag

BLUE SHIRT
Whoops Son of a--

BRUNETTE GIRL
My purse is in there My credit
cards all my cash everything

BLUE SHIRT
I’m really sorry
(off her look)
Oh Should I um

BRUNETTE GIRL
My whole life is in that bag

YELLOW SHIRT
You knocked it in dumbass Be a
man go save the day

Blue Shirt SIGHS Then he sits down ponderously takes off his
shoes carefully stuffs his socks into them

He hesitates takes a deep breath looks down at the ocean
swirling twenty feet below him hesitates some more

BRUNETTE GIRL
Oh for crying out loud

John watches the Brunette Girl kick off her own shoes start
to climb up the rail
John grins And then without hardly even thinking about it

he sets his beer down hops the rail and jumps down into the

ocean himself

He dives under -- John is clearly comfortable in water -- and

finds the bag on the ocean floor quickly He reemerges to find
the group on the pier staring down at him in astonishment

John just paddles back to shore The Brunette Girl meets him
at the bottom of the pier all smiles

BRUNETTE GIRL
Thank you so much

Blue Shirt trails close behind her
BLUE SHIRT
Yeah thanks But you really didn’t
have to do that I was just about
to jump in
JOHN
I know you were I was just saving
you the trouble
He hands the bag to the Brunette Their fingers brush briefly

BRUNETTE GIRL
My name’s Savannah

JOHN
I’m John

She and John hold eye contact Blue Shirt clears his throat

BLUE SHIRT
Maybe you should give him a reward

Savannah glares at Blue Shirt John registers the insult
JOHN
I don’t want a reward I was just
trying to help

He nods goodbye to Savannah turns to leave

JOHN
You all have a good night

Then he starts to walk away But Savannah calls after him

SAVANNAH
Wait

She hurries over alone Blue and Yellow Shirt trade a look
SAVANNAH
I’m staying right over there
Weve got food and -- I mean do

you want something to eat

JOHN
Thanks but I should really be
getting home

SAVANNAH
C’mon One good deed deserves
another right

JOHN
It’s just that my Dad’s expecting me
back for dinner I don’t want to
ruin my appetite

SAVANNAH
Oh you won’t Our food is terrible

She smiles at him Reaches her hand out Looks him in the eye

SAVANNAH
Come on John Don’t make me beg

John pauses then he holds out his hand too and their
fingers touch again

AT A BONFIRE -- LATER

COLLEGE KIDS wander around near the house While Blonde Girl
and Yellow Shirt take a walk down the beach--

--John sits in awkward silence across from Blue Shirt

Then Savannah returns with two drinks to both their relief
Blue Shirt scoots over on his log making room for her

But she takes a seat beside John hands him the other drink

Blue Shirt eyeballs John notices that under his armpit
above his rib cage he’s got a ‘meat tag’ which is basically
a tattooed dog tag with his name ID etc

BLUE SHIRT
You in the military or something
(off John’s nod)
What branch

John flashes him his sapphire ring (which he never takes off
not even when he’s surfing)

JOHN
Army Special Forces
BLUE SHIRT
Yeah Nice ring -- where’s your
beret did you leave it at home

Blue Shirt grins -- he’s egging John on John just ignores
the comment but Savannah levels her gaze at Blue Shirt

SAVANNAH
Hey Randy I thought Susan told
me you were smart

BLUE SHIRT (RANDY)
I am smart

SAVANNAH
Then why are you making fun of a
guy who could kill you with his
bare hands

The smile wipes off Randy’s face He looks down chagrined

Suddenly realizes three’s a crowd

RANDY
I’m gonna go get another beer

He leaves John and Savannah are alone now

JOHN
I’m not so sure I could kill him
with my bare hands actually He
has a thick neck

SAVANNAH
Sorry about him -- he thinks he
likes me

JOHN

I think he likes you too

SAVANNAH
Nah I’m not his type he just
doesn’t know it yet
(off John’s grin)
What What are you smiling about

JOHN
I just think you’re probably
everybody’s type

John grins

At that moment a SIX YEAR-OLD BOY comes out of nowhere and

bear hugs Savannah almost knocking her over

JOHN
See what I mean
The boy’s name is ALAN and although it may or may not be
apparent right away he’s autistic But Savannah’s delighted
to see him

SAVANNAH
Alan this is John Say hello

Alan hides his head instead

SAVANNAH
He’s shy Alan where’s your Dad at

VOICE
Two steps behind him as usual

They turn to find TIM a friendly looking guy in his early
30’s When he rubs Savannah’s head as a greeting it’s
obvious they’ve known each other for years

TIM
Sorry He’s like a heat-seeking
missile when he sees you
(then noticing John)
Oh hey I’m Tim

They shake hands Tim notices his sapphire ring right away

TIM
Special Forces huh Where you
stationed out of Fort Bragg

JOHN
Germany actually

TIM
You’re on leave
(off his nod)
Good for you I hope you’re
enjoying yourself

John glances over at Savannah She smiles

JOHN
Yeah Yeah I think I am

Tim sees the smile and realizes what he’s walked into

TIM
Well sorry to interrupt Nice to
meet you though -- c’mon son

Alan gives Savannah one last hug Then as he goes Alan
calls back to John almost as an afterthought --

ALAN
Hello John

John smiles Waves goodbye

JOHN
Hello Alan

Tim and Savannah trade a quick look impressed Then Tim
heads Alan back inside the BEACH HOUSE next door

SAVANNAH

Wow That was a pretty big deal
JOHN

Yeah
SAVANNAH

Alan doesn’t talk to just anybody
He doesn’t talk to anybody at all
actually other than his family

JOHN
He talked to you

SAVANNAH
Well we’re practically family
I’ve known him since he was born

She looks back up at the impressive house behind her

SAVANNAH
This was my great-grandparents
beach house They passed it down
to my grandparents who passed it
down to my parents

(re the house next door)

Same thing with Tim’s family I’ve
spent every summer of my life right
here So has Tim And so has Alan

JOHN
It’s -- it’s a beautiful house

SAVANNAH
Yeah well don’t let it fool you
I’m not one of those girls

JOHN
Which girls

SAVANNAH
You know perfectly well which girls

She motions towards the house College kids are everywhere--
in the house on the deck by the beach And some of them are
definitely “those girls”
SAVANNAH
I don’t even know all these people
actually But the more the merrier
right It is vacation after all

John pauses Watches the college kids be college kids

JOHN
Yeah It is

Savannah looks at John Studies him as he watches the others

They’re all by themselves now -- no one else is nearby

SAVANNAH
When do you go back

JOHN
A week from Monday

SAVANNAH
It must be scary what you do

JOHN
It’s boring mostly Long stretches
of boring Occasional flashes of
scary

There’s a lull in conversation Not an uncomfortable one

though Savannah looks out on the ocean It’s getting dark

and the moon is rising on the horizon

SAVANNAH
Full moon tonight Look at how
huge that thing is

She stands From John’s view the moon is as large as she is

SAVANNAH
You ever notice how big the moon is
when it’s rising but how little it
gets when it’s up in the sky

JOHN
That’s just an optical illusion
actually C’mere I’1ll show you

He stands behind her very close now and raises her arm

JOHN
The moon’s size doesn’t ever change
only your perspective does When
it’s against the horizon it looks
like it’s enormous but if you shut
one of your eyes and hold out
your hand like this

He holds his thumb up She does the same -- and from their
perspective the moon disappears behind it

JOHN
No matter where it is in the sky
No matter where you are in the
world the moon is never bigger
than your thumb

Savannah opens her other eye The moon is big again Then
she does John’s trick and again the moon becomes thumb-
sized She smiles up at him His face is inches from hers

SAVANNAH
Where’d you learn that

John looks down at her Shrugs

JOHN
Somewhere along the way

FROM THE DECK --

Randy watches John and Savannah look out at the ocean so
close together and backlit by the giant moon He takes a
heavy swig of his beer unable to hide his bitterness

THE MOON --

--is way up in the night sky now An hour or two have passed
and the bonfire is long out now Savannah lies in the sand
watching John inspect a dangerous looking hot dog

JOHN
How is it possible for a hot dog to
be so burnt on the outside and so
raw on the inside

Savannah doesn’t answer just smiles So John grabs a few
pieces of wood and gathers some kindling

Then he produces a flint and magnesium block keychain from his
pocket shaves off some magnesium with a pocketknife and
strikes the flint Instant sparks slowly reignite the fire

Savannah watches amused as John recooks his hot dog

SAVANNAH

Wow You can start your own fire I
don’t think I’ve ever met a boy who
can start his own fire

(off his modest shrug)
No no it’s very impressive
Very primal What’re you gonna do
next make me a sundial

John grins shakes his head nods up at the dark sky

JOHN
Wouldn’t do much good now

But that reminds him he grabs Savannah’s arm checks the
time on her watch Time has flown by

JOHN
Shoot I should go

Savannah nods She knew he was gonna have to leave eventually
SAVANNAH
Sorry I hope you won’t get in too

much trouble

John looks at her Laying there in the sand under the stars
she looks just about perfect John chuckles to himself

JOHN
Too late

Savannah smiles at him But John shyly turns away grabs his
surfboard prepares to leave Savannah watches him

SAVANNAH
Wellthank you For what you did
JOHN
You’re welcome
Takes a few steps then turns around
JOHN

Any chance you’d wanna do this again
tomorrow night

Savannah smiles wider

SAVANNAH
Tomorrow night is chicken You’re
not gonna want to try the chicken

JOHN
Yeah I was thinking we could let
someone else cook this time

SAVANNAH
Are you asking me out on a date

JOHN
I guess I am
(re half-eaten hot dog)
One good deed deserves another
right

She thinks Smiles at him again

SAVANNAH
Tomorrow night then

He smiles back at her

JOHN
Tomorrow night then

ON A ROAD -- TEN MINUTES LATER

John walks north carrying his surfboard Headlights from
the occasional car illuminate him as they pass by

A truck comes up from behind him But this one slows down to
a crawl as it passes John and then the reverse lights come
on and the truck backs up until John sees that the driver --

-- is Tim Next to him Alan is in the passenger seat
totally focused on his GAME BOY

TIM
Need a lift We’re headed into
town for some ice cream

JOHN
Thanks But I don’t mind walking

TIM
How long’s the walk

JOHN
Couple miles

Tim looks at him Then without a word he gets out of the
car takes John’s board and puts it in the back of his truck
He calls to Alan in the cab

TIM
Scoot over son

Alan does as he’s told John opens the passenger door Alan
looks up from his game makes eye contact

ALAN
Hello John

John smiles at him impressed he remembered So is Tim

JOHN
Hey Alan

But then Alan just goes right back to his game Tim gets in
and they start on down the road

JOHN
So how long are you in town for

TIM
Oh we live here year round now
Alan loves the water and we were
driving down every weekend anyway
I finally convinced my wife this
just made the most sense

John looks over at Tim who’s focused on the road ahead

JOHN
She didn’t want any ice cream
TIM
Who Oh my wife -- no She’s on

vacation herself actually
He smiles to himself but doesn’t take his eyes off the road

TIM
I guess I thought if we spent all
year in our vacation house we’ll
have a year-round vacation But it
doesn’t really work like that And
it’s kind of tricky to take trips
together since

He trails off but it’s clear he’s talking about Alan --
although Alan is too wrapped up in his video game to notice

TIM
But it’s fine We make it work

JOHN
I’m up here on the left

Tim turns into his driveway John opens the car door
JOHN
Thanks for the lift Tim
(as he gets out)
Bye Alan

But Alan doesn’t even look up from his game Tim pauses

TIM
Hey John Just -- for the record --
if you do anything to hurt Savannah
I’1l have to break something

Something in your leg One of the
bones in there somewhere

John looks at him surprised Tim sighs a bit embarrassed

TIM
I know her father he’d want me to
say that Although it would’ve
sounded a lot more natural coming
out of his mouth

JOHN
It -- sounded fine

TIM
No it didn’t Thank you though

Tim smiles at John He’s pretty hard not to like

TIM
Goodnight John

Then he pulls away John watches the tail lights slowly
disappear down the road

INSIDE HIS FATHER’S HOUSE --

John walks into the LIVING ROOM The whole house is dark and
quiet except for a light beneath one hallway door

IN HIS FATHER’S STUDY --

MR TYREE is balding His shirt is a size too small and a
decade too old He is intently focused on a COIN in front of
him and does not turn away from it when John walks in

JOHN
Hey Dad

MR TYREE
Your dinner’s in the fridge

John stands in the doorway This does not appear to be a
room that he walks into often

JOHN
Sorry I didn’t make it home earlier

Mr Tyree shrugs Grabs a magnifying glass turns the coin
over doesn’t say another word John just watches him waiting
for a response even though he knows nothing’s going to come

JOHN
Anyway See you tomorrow Dad

MR TYREE
Goodnight John

John closes the door behind him as he leaves

IN THE KITCHEN -- THE NEXT DAY

It is bright outside now and Mr Tyree is making a large
salad His socks are mismatched

John walks out of his bedroom in a nice shirt sees his Dad at
work on the salad realizes he hasn’t mentioned his plans

JOHN
I’m not staying for dinner Dad

MR TYREE
But I made lasagna

JOHN
Yeah it’s Sunday night I know
you made lasagna

Mr Tyree glances up at him Then quickly turns back to his
salad John sighs feels like he should explain

JOHN
It’s just I’ve got a date

MR TYREE
Okay

This time John does not wait long for the follow up question
he knows won’t come He heads to the front door then turns

JOHN
Hey Dad

Mr Tyree looks up at him John hesitates long enough for us
to know he wants to say something more

JOHN
Can I borrow the car

Mr Tyree digs in his pocket holds the car keys out

THE SHRIMP SHACK -- THAT EVENING

John pulls his dad’s old Lincoln Continental into the parking
lot of the SHRIMP SHACK which looks exactly like it sounds

He hurries over to open Savannah’s door for her She is
studying the restaurant intently

JOHN
I know it doesn’t look like much
But it’s got the best seafood
youve ever had Seriously

She takes his hand and lets him pull her out of the car

INSIDE --

Savannah and John are the best dressed customers by far The
place is crowded with regulars not tourists John nods
evenly at the OWNER BEHIND THE BAR

JOHN
Hey Steve

Steve doesn’t respond just gives John the death stare John
sighs then heads over to the bar and quietly takes him aside

JOHN
C’mon man It’s been three years

STEVE THE OWNER
I don’t want any trouble

JOHN
You won’t get any Okay I promise

Steve pauses weighing his options Then finally he nods
over to the hostess giving his okay

She takes them to a table by a window overlooking the water
Savannah looks at John curiously

SAVANNAH
What was that about

JOHN
I just haven’t been here ina
while that’s all

A HOSTESS arrives to get their drinks and Savannah orders a
sweet tea

John glances over at Steve behind the bar again He’s
watching John closely listening to what he’s gonna order

JOHN
Uh sweet tea for me too please

The hostess heads off But Savannah noticed the look John
stole toward the bar and misreads it thinking that she’s the
reason he only ordered tea

SAVANNAH
It’s okay You can get a beer if
you want don’t let me stop you

JOHN
Nah I don’t drink

Savannah cocks her head at him

SAVANNAH
You were drinking when I met you

John doesn’t have to look over at the bar this time to know
that Steve is watching him He stumbles for an excuse

JOHN
Um-- anymore I don’t drink anymore

SAVANNAH
I met you yesterday

JOHN
Yeah well things change But
don’t let me stop you -- you can
get a beer if you want one

SAVANNAH
Nah I don’t drink anymore either

JOHN
Oh yeah Since when

She looks him in the eye Grins

SAVANNAH
Since that Zima back in 8th grade

He smiles back at her

JOHN
Musta been one hell of a Zima

SAVANNAH
Those things can knock you over
lemme tell ya

The waitress drops their teas off at the table John orders
a bucket of shrimp as an appetizer and she’s off again

SAVANNAH
So Did your Dad get mad at you
for coming home late last night

JOHN
Nah My Dad my Dad’s not the
kinda guy who really gets mad

SAVANNAH
Oh yeah What kinda guy is he then

JOHN
A quiet kinda one

Savannah studies him feeling him out

SAVANNAH
Could be worse I guess

JOHN
I guess

The waitress drops the shrimp off John waits for Savannah to
take one first but she doesn’t She just looks at him

John SIGHS realizing he’s going to have to give her more
JOHN
It’s no big deal Him and I we

just don’t talk very much

SAVANNAH
Why not

John shrugs He breaks the standoff starts to peel a shrimp

JOHN
I have my theories

Savannah snatches the shrimp out of his fingers and eats it
herself She grins at him

SAVANNAH
Wow Those are good I want to
meet him

JOHN

Meet who My father
Savannah nods John hesitates

JOHN
Okay

SAVANNAH
Tonight I want to meet him tonight

John hesitates again

JOHN
That’s not quite what I had planned

SAVANNAH
(playfully)
And what did you have planned
exactly John

JOHN
Nothing no that’s not -- I didn’t
have any specific plans -- but they

definitely did not involve my Dad

Savannah peels John a shrimp now Her eyes twinkle
SAVANNAH
Well guess we’ve got a change of
plans then huh

BACK AT JOHNS HOUSE -- LATER

John walks in the front door Savannah follows Again all
the lights are off except the one in his Dad’s office

JOHN
You’re not gonna get much out of
him Don’t take it personally
Savannah nods John lightly knocks on the office door

JOHN
Dad Got someone I want you to meet

Mr Tyree is focused on his coins as usual but he stands
awkwardly when they enter

JOHN
This is Savannah

She smiles at him offers out her hand He shakes it

SAVANNAH
It’s really nice to meet you

Mr Tyree doesn’t respond Silence fills the room Mr Tyree
glances back at his desk which seems to offer him some
comfort Savannah follows his gaze So does John

JOHN
Um -- my Dad collects coins It’s
his big hobby

SAVANNAH
Really How interesting

Mr Tyree shrugs inching closer to his desk as Savannah
looks around the room Coins really are everywhere

SAVANNAH
You have so many How’d you get
started in all of this
Mr Tyree stands perfectly still scratches his bald head

MR TYREE
Through John actually

He glances over at John John just looks away

MR TYREE
But they’re not really his thing
anymore

JOHN

Okay Anyhow we should probably--

SAVANNAH
Tell me about this one

She picks up a very worn and faded PENNY off his desk
MR TYREE
This one This one’s a mule Most

all of these are mules actually

Savannah glances at John mouths “What’s a mule” John rolls
his eyes shakes his head -- trust me you don’t wanna know

Mr Tyree doesn’t notice however too focused on the coin in
Savannah’s hand He politely but firmly takes it away from
her Obviously he doesn’t like other people touching them

As he returns the coin to it’s proper spot John’s face burns
with embarrassment This is his father antisocial to a fault

But then Mr Tyree looks over his shoulder at Savannah makes
eye contact with her for the first time

MR TYREE
Wanna see some more

Savannah smiles at him And so John-- half annoyed half
amazed -- watches his father show off his collection

BACK AT SAVANNAH’S BEACH HOUSE -- LATE THAT NIGHT

John pulls his father’s car into Savannah’s driveway They
sit in his car neither in a rush for the night to end

SAVANNAH
I like your Dad I like people that
have a passion for life

JOHN
He has a passion for coins Not the
same

SAVANNAH

Passion’s passion John He raised
you all by himself

JOHN
Ever since I can remember I was
two when my Mom left

SAVANNAH
Has he always been that solitary

JOHN
Ever since I can remember

SAVANNAH
So what’s your theory On how come
you guys don’t talk

John gets quiet looks away

JOHN
Why

SAVANNAH
Because I have a theory too and I
want to see if it’s the same

John shrugs stares out the window into the ocean
JOHN

I just I don’t think we like
each other to tell you the truth

SAVANNAH
John Come on You’re family
JOHN
Exactly We’re stuck with one
another -- it’s not like either of

us had much choice in the matter

Savannah still doesn’t say anything She doesn’t push him to
talk doesn’t ask too many questions just waits him out
JOHN

I well I was a headache when I
was younger I was a lot of trouble
I got kicked out of school a few
times I think at some point he
just musta figured-- enough was
enough He’d rather deal with his
coins than with me His coins don’t
argue and they don’t talk back

John stops suddenly self-conscious of how much he’s talking

JOHN
Why what’s your theory

Savannah smiles back at him

SAVANNAH
My theory’s a little different

She leans in kisses him on the cheek
SAVANNAH
Don’t be too hard on him okay He
loves you I can tell even if you
can’t

Then she gets out leans back into the window The wind
blows through her hair and he doesn’t take his eyes off her

JOHN
When can I see you again

SAVANNAH
When do you want to see me again

JOHN
As soon as possible

She looks back at him Her eyes do that twinkling thing

SAVANNAH
As soon as possible then

Then she turns and heads up to the house John watches her
go still unable to take his eyes off her

BACK AT JOHNS HOUSE -- LATER

John walks in the door His father’s office light is still
shining through the crack beneath the door

John walks past it into his own bedroom

IN THE OCEAN -- THE NEXT DAY

John out on his board having positioned himself directly in
front of Savannah’s place The waves are good but he keeps
missing them too busy stealing glances into the house

There are a lot of people milling around inside But there’s
no sign of Savannah John grimaces misses another wave

A FEW HOURS LATER --

It’s getting dark now Most of the surfers are heading home

John stays out however paddling in the water eyeing the
beach house It’s quieter now -- the crowd’s headed somewhere
else apparently -- and there’s still no sign of Savannah

IN THE BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT NOW

Even quieter Only a few people snooze on the couches

Then finally the front door opens and Savannah enters tired
and sweaty She looks around surprised at how quiet it is

ON THE DECK --

Savannah walks out looks at the night sky The deck and
beach are empty too -- only one figure still remains in the
water Savannah smiles when she realizes who it is

IN THE OCEAN --

It’s too dark for John to see the waves until they’re almost
on top of him and even then it’s hard to measure their size
He misses a good wave curses at himself under his breath

Then he sees the figure waiting for him by the water When
he realizes who it is he smiles too and quickly paddles in

SAVANNAH
Little late to be out isn’t it

JOHN
Nah I have the whole ocean to
myself now It’s quiet out there
it’s peaceful it’s

SAVANNAH
-dark

JOHN
And it’s dark Yes Very dark
Where have you been all day

She shrugs Grins at him

SAVANNAH
None of your business

JOHN
You’re on spring break Youre
supposed to be lounging around on
the beach wasting the day away
You’re not supposed to be out
doing things

SAVANNAH
You have your spring break I’11
have mine

John steps out of the water

JOHN
What if I want yours too

She pauses Then she smiles again and as she reaches out to
take his hand once again --

CLOSE ON THEIR HANDS --

--as John helps Savannah out of his car now It’s an hour
later they’ve changed clothes and they’re in front of

A HALF BUILT HOUSE -- NIGHT NOW

No one is around but construction materials are everywhere
and the house is clearly a work in progress

SAVANNAH
The family that lives here their
home was severely damaged by
Hurricane Dennis So we ripped it
down and we’re building them
another one from scratch We’re a
little behind schedule though

JOHN
Whos we

SAVANNAH
Habitat for Humanity I’ve been
volunteering since I was little

JOHN

Wait a minute let me get this
straight You’ve been secretly
sneaking off every day to do
manual labor On a house for the
needy On your spring break

(off her shrug)
Okay you’re kinda making me
nervous here

SAVANNAH
Why

JOHN
I’m a little worried that you may
be too good of a person for me

SAVANNAH
I’m not that good of a person
JOHN
You do charity work for fun
SAVANNAH
It’s not that fun
(beat then )

Okay It’s pretty fun

JOHN
You don’t drink

SAVANNAH
Nope

JOHN
You don’t smoke

SAVANNAH
No way

JOHN

You probably don’t sleep around

She moves close almost -- but not quite -- seductively and
she smiles up at him

SAVANNAH
Absolutely not

John eyes her Registers how close she is to him

JOHN
You gotta have a fault in there
somewhere

SAVANNAH
Sure I have lots of them

JOHN
Well just name one Please Cause
I’m getting a little intimidated

Savannah narrows her eyes at him Thinks

SAVANNAH
I curse like a sailor

JOHN
No you don’t You havent said a
single bad word the entire time
I’ve known you

SAVANNAH
Well I think them There’s a never-
ending internal stream of cuss
words going on up here

JOHN
Oh yeah What are you thinking
right now

SAVANNAH
I can’t say But it’s filthy I
swear

Savannah grins looks him in the eye They are very close now

SAVANNAH
I have faults John I have plenty
of them Youll see
John steps even closer Thunder RUMBLES in the distance

JOHN
Hope so

Savannah does not take her eyes off of him Their faces are
just inches apart They are having a moment

Then she grabs his hand again

SAVANNAH
C’mon

INSIDE THE HOUSE --

The concrete slab is set and the wooden framework is mostly
complete but there’s not even a roof yet Nevertheless
Savannah gives John the grand tour under the open night sky

SAVANNAH
These rooms are gonna be the boys
wing back here and then -- oh

come on I want to show you this
John follows her into another room of the house

SAVANNAH
The Mom is a great cook so this is
gonna be a huge kitchen and there’s
gonna be one of those marble islands
right here so -- look --

She points at a square in the wooden frame Through it is a
partially obscured view of the beach

SAVANNAH
SO she can see the ocean while
she cooks

Right then rain drops begin to fall on the nonexistent
marble island light at first but getting heavier quickly

SAVANNAH
And there’s gonna be a roof too so
she won’t get wet while she cooks

It’s one of those Southern spring showers that comes on fast
and strong so they duck under a nearby overhang and wait for
it to pass John builds a couple of makeshift seats with
some crates Savannah studies him as he works
SAVANNAH
Where’d you get your scar

There’s a decent sized scar on one of his eyebrows He
reflexively brushes it with his hand

JOHN
Knife fight Five years ago Big
guy drunk as a skunk Dirtier than
one too He was going for my eye

SAVANNAH
Oh my god That’s terrible

JOHN
Why He missed

John helps her up on one of the crates

SAVANNAH
Can I touch it

John nods She slowly runs her finger over his eyebrow

SAVANNAH
The way people act around you -- the
way they treated you at that
restaurant It’s like they’re scared
of you

JOHN
They’re not scared of me They’re
scared of who I used to be maybe

SAVANNAH
And who was that

JOHN
Somebody different

The rain begins to come down even harder
SAVANNAH
When did you change When you went

into the army

JOHN
Partly

She moves closer to him Looks him in the eye

SAVANNAH
And the other part

John looks away Shrugs

JOHN
Still working on the other part

Savannah watches him Finally she smiles

SAVANNAH
So you used to be tough And maybe
you still are But you don’t scare
me one bit John

He smiles back leans in towards her

JOHN
No Well you scare me

Then he kisses her It starts small but it builds into
something much bigger It becomes so intense that it’s a
struggle to catch their breath

JOHN
Jesus

Savannah straddles John

SAVANNAH
You shouldnt take the Lord’s
name in
(as he kisses her harder)
Oh Jesus

The rain around them gets heavier and heavier So do they
John starts to take off her shirt Savannah stops him

SAVANNAH
John
(off his hesitation)
I’m sorry It’s just that I
I’ve never actually quite uh

John suddenly realizes what she means

JOHN
It’s okay You don’t have to explain

She looks up at him looks into his eyes looks at his scar
SAVANNAH
I know I don’t I feel like I don’t
have to explain anything to you

She kisses him pulls him down beside her

SAVANNAH
And that that scares me

They lay together there on the crates
SAVANNAH
Can you see it What this house is
going to be like when it’s done

JOHN
Yes I can

John looks out at the ocean through the square where the
kitchen window will be

SAVANNAH
We only have two weeks left though

JOHN
Don’t worry You’1ll finish

THUNDER rolls in the distance

SAVANNAH
I wasn’t talking about the house

Then as they lay together while the rain pelt the wooden
frame around them --

MATCH CUT
ON THE HOUSE -- NEXT DAY --

The rain has stopped the sun is out Savannah arrives again
bright and early and ready to work

A few other volunteers are already here Savannah heads over
to say hello -- and her mouth falls open

There’s John up in the rafters fitting a beam into it’s
frame He grins at her nods a silent hello

QUT IN THE OCEAN -- ANOTHER DAY

John holds his surfboard for an unsteady Savannah teaching
her how to balance on it

A wave comes and John loses his grip Savannah falls into the
water disappears below it

John looks around can’t find her Then she suddenly pops up
behind him pushes him down under the surface

UPON THE BEACH --
Savannah’s friend Susan watches warily on as Savannah and

John splash in the water laughing and kissing completely
unaware of the world around them

BACK AT THE HOUSE -- ANOTHER DAY

The roof is being tar papered the walls are being stuccoed

Up front Savannah and John work together to fit the kitchen
ocean window into it’s frame

AT THE DINNER TABLE -- ANOTHER NIGHT

Three places have been set for once Savannah John and Mr
Tyree eat their meatloaf in an easy silence

IN THE KITCHEN -- LATER

As Mr Tyree carefully measures out the exact right amount of
detergent then begins to load the dishes into the sink --

IN THE HALLWAY —-

Savannah’s heading to the bathroom when John pulls her into
his bedroom He gently pins her against the wall kisses her
on her shoulder her neck her lips

Savannah starts to get into it She glances out in the hall
sees Mr Tyree standing over the sink his back to them but
still only feet away

JOHN
Don’t worry He gets very focused

Back in the bedroom John can’t keep his hands off her She
grins up at him

SAVANNAH
Yeah so do you

She makes her escape by slipping out from under his arm but
John grabs her by the waist pulls her onto the bed

Savannah laughs rolls right over him back onto solid ground
John makes a couple of playful swipes at her legs She puts a
hand on his forehead mockingly holds him at arm’s distance

Then John breaks free and Savannah SHRIEKS ducking by him
again jumping into --

HIS CLOSET --

-- where she slides the door shut and holds it closed
laughing harder now

But then when she realizes what’s surrounding her the smile
wipes off her face She stares at the clothes hanging in this
closet Clothes she’s never seen John wear

Here are indoor and outdoor fatigues Here are a pair of
urban camos And here are two blue dress uniforms

She’s alone in this four foot box surrounded by reminder of
who he is and where he’s going

AT THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HOUSE -- THE NEXT NIGHT

-- it’s dark and empty but almost finished now The roof is
done and the exterior is almost all painted A lot has been
accomplished in the past six days

OVER AT SAVANNAHS BEACH HOUSE --

John walks up the driveway to find the front door wide open
Inside an End-Of-Spring-Break party is going strong

The house is more crowded than ever John walks in looks
around for Savannah She’s nowhere to be found

OUTSTIDE--

Plenty of people are around the bonfire as well including
Randy and Susan and her boyfriend Savannah’s neighbor Tim
is over on his deck next door chatting with a couple KIDS
Nearby his son Alan has his nose in his Game Boy as usual

John looks all around but Savannah’s not out here Then he
glances down the beach sees a LONE FIGURE down on the pier

NEAR THE BONFIRE --

-- through the flames Randy ignores the girl YAMMERING next
to him as he watches John head up the beach alone

AT THE END OF THE PIER --

Savannah sits on the edge her back to John

JOHN
You’re missing the party

She startles tries to wipe her tears away before he sees

SAVANNAH
It’s managing just fine without me

JOHN
(noticing the tears)
What’s wrong

She wipes her eyes again tries to pretend she doesn’t know
what he’s talking about John’s not buying it though

Savannah SIGHS gives up the act She looks straight at him
SAVANNAH
I’m dying John

John reacts But Savannah rolls her eyes

SAVANNAH
Sheesh I’m not dying you sap Do
I look like I’m dying Quit being so
melodramatic

John glares at her not amused Savannah shrugs

SAVANNAH
I’m just sad cause it’s almost over

John turns Knows she’s not talking about Spring Break

JOHN
Savannah It’s not almost over

SAVANNAH
I leave tomorrow I have to be in
class on Monday and you have to be
on an airplane overseas--

JOHN
But I’ll be back Twelve months
until my commitment is up and I’1l
be back for good

SAVANNAH
A lot can happen between now and
then okay Don’t sit here and
make me promises--

JOHN

I will sit here and make you
promises And I’1ll keep them too

(off her silence)
You think you’re worried about
promises I’m the one who’s gotta
go over there -- wherever there is
I’m the one who’s gotta go to sleep
alone in that tent or those
barracks or that hut hoping that
tomorrow might be the day you’1l
call or you’1ll write hoping that
tomorrow won’t be the day you
forget about me that tomorrow
won’t be the day you meet some
great new guy at the Friday night
Sigma Nu mixer who’1ll make you
realize waiting for me isn’t worth
it anymore

SAVANNAH
John you’ve obviously never been
to a Friday night Sigma Nu mixer

She smiles He squeezes her hand

She looks

John does

JOHN
It’s a helluva jump But we take
it together

at him then she kisses him hard

JOHN
I’ll be back for your graduation
Then we figure out what’s next

SAVANNAH

Well graduation may take me a
little longer now I decided to
switch majors

JOHN
Really When

SAVANNAH
I dunno Sometime this week though
spending all this time with your
Dad You’re gonna laugh but -- I
want to teach special education I
want to help people

laugh

JOHN
You don’t say

SAVANNAH

I don’t know why it took me so long
to realize it I grew up next door
to Alan He’s always been drawn to
me for some reason and I’m drawn to
him too and I’m just I’m not drawn
to marketing you know I don’t care
about marketing and I don’t think
it makes any sense to get a degree
in something I don’t care about

(off his grin)
What

JOHN
Nothing I just don’t care about
marketing either In fact I don’t
give a shit about marketing So I
think it’s great

(MORE)
JOHN (contd)

When I get back I’1ll move to Chapel
Hill Ill get a job somewhere
youll get your Special Ed degree
and neither of us’1ll ever think
about marketing again for the rest
of our lives

(re a nearby Nike

advertisement)
Hey I like those shoes

Savannah laughs They stare out at the water together

JOHN
How did hanging around my Dad make
you come to a decision like that

He says it with a smile -- not suspicious at all But
Savannah looks down pulls away from John slightly She
hesitates trying to pick the right words

SAVANNAH
Thereare signs John Youve
seen them yourself even if you
didn’t realize you were seeing them

JOHN
Wait -- what

SAVANNAH
I just think there’s an explanation
for why he is the way he is a
medical reason that might account
for his deficiencies--

JOHN
Deficiencies Hold up what are
you saying You saying he’s
retarded or something

SAVANNAH
No of course not I’m just saying he
does show some classic signs of mild
autism--

JOHN
Whoa whoa Autism You think he’s
like Alan

SAVANNAH
Alan is severely autistic but
there are milder cases too
functional cases that go
undiagnosed all the time Theres
something called Aspergers
Syndrome and I think your Dad--

JOHN
You don’t know shit about my Dad
okay You’ve met him twice

John stands up Glares down at her

JOHN
You let him show you his coins for
a half hour and all of a sudden
you’re his doctor and his
psychiatrist All of a sudden
youve got a couple PhD’s and
you’re an expert on my father

SAVANNAH
No No I’m not saying--

She grabs his hand but he rips it away

JOHN
I’ve lived with him my whole life
okay I’ve put up with him my whole
life I know he’s not normal You
think I need you to tell me he’s not
normal

She tries to grab his hand again but John yanks it away
again then turns and starts to walk away

SAVANNAH
John wait John

But John doesn’t stop
BY THE BONFIRE --

Randy sees John stalk back towards the house Randy finishes
a beer and calls out to him emboldened by alcohol

RANDY
Trouble in paradise

John doesn’t answer Randy glances over at the pier sees
Savannah hunched over in the distance

RANDY
What happened Hold on -- did you
hurt her or something

John still doesn’t answer Randy steps in front of him

RANDY
If you laid a finger on her--

JOHN
What What’re you gonna do
(off his silence)
Just get out of my way okay

But Randy doesn’t People around them start to notice

RANDY
You think you’re so tough You’re
Mr Tough Army Guy aren’t you
Well I don’t give a shit who you
are you’re not going anywhere
until I know she’s okay

JOHN
Get out of my way I’m not gonna
ask you again

John tries to walk through him but Randy shoves him back

John does his best to stay calm He takes a deep breath --
then walks around Randy -- but Randy shoves him back again

So John squares off Takes a step directly at him --
-- and Randy makes the mistake of trying to throw a punch

John catches his fist yanks it behind Randy’s back and gives
him a quick debilitating shot to the solar plexis

Susan’s boyfriend (Yellow Shirt) is already charging at John
but one quick right jab sends him straight into the sand too

Then there’s a voice from behind -- HEY -- and then a hand
on John’s shoulder -- and John reflexively swings his elbow
up -- causing a nose to audibly CRUNCH

John turns to find Tim already sunk to his knees his nose
already a bloody mess It’s all over in a flash

Savannah hurries up from the pier takes in all three guys
crumpled over and in pain She looks up at John aghast

SAVANNAH
What’d you do

John looks back at her Regret already flashes on his face
But there’s nothing he can say So --

ON A ROAD -- FIVE MINUTES LATER

John tromps down the side of the road Headlights from the
occasional car illuminate him as they pass by

But this time none stop for him John walks home alone

BACK AT JOHN’S HOUSE -- THAT NIGHT

John shuts the front door behind him As always his
father’s office light is the only one on in the house

The door to his office is cracked John pushes it open
Mr Tyree is in the same spot his back to the door going
over his coin collection as usual He either doesn’t hear
John behind him or just pretends not to

John stands in the door and silently watches his father work

OUTSIDE SAVANNAH’S BEACH HOUSE -- THE NEXT DAY

John paces back and forth in the driveway unsure of whether
he should go knock on the front door or not He hesitates

--and then just as he decides it’s probably best for him to
leave the front door opens and Susan walks out towing a
suitcase She stops when she sees John

SUSAN
She’s not here And you shouldn’t
be either If they see you
there’s just gonna be more trouble

JOHN
Randy and your boyfriend are
they okay

SUSAN

They’1l be fine
John pauses Decides what else there is to say

JOHN
Will you just will you let her
know I stopped by

SUSAN
(re her suitcase)
I’m heading home right now

John nods Gets the picture

JOHN
Well tell the others I’m sorry

He turns starts to walk down the driveway Susan loads her
bag in her car then calls after him

SUSAN
I’ve known her for a long time
John I’ve never seen her like this

JOHN
She’s angry I get that But--

SUSAN
That’s not what I meant I’ve seen
her angry plenty of times trust me
(off his confusion)
I meant that before you went all
Heart Of Darkness yesterday I’d
never seen her this happy

She gets in her car turns it on then rolls down the window

SUSAN
You’ve come this far Don’t screw
it up now

With that she puts the car in gear and drives away As John
watches her go he notices that --

NEXT DOOR --

--Tim is taking the garbage out He has a serious shiner and
his nose has been set

JOHN
Jesus

TIM
(re his nose)
When this thing comes off I’m gonna
look so tough you have no idea

JOHN
Tim I swear I didn’t realize it
was you back there--

TIM
It’s my fault I don’t know what I
was thinking sneaking up behind an
angry Green Beret like that

He looks over at Savannah’s house quickly susses out what
John’s doing here He nods towards the door

TIM
I’m not sure if she’s left yet
She normally says goodbye before
she goes back but

JOHN
If you see her will you give her a
message for me

TIM
Sure Wanna write it down

He pulls a pen out of his pocket and a tossed away phone bill
from the top of the garbage hands them to John

Tim heads over to dump the trash out gives John some
privacy John writes something down It doesn’t take long
Then he folds the paper and as he holds it out to Tim --

BACK AT JOHN’S HOUSE --

Mr Tyree pulls two trays of lasagna out of the oven John
walks in nods hello to his Dad

MR TYREE
I didn’t know if anybody else might
be coming so I made double

John glances at the two trays surprised at the divergence
from the norm

JOHN
Okay I’1ll set the table

MR TYREE
Already did

John walks into the dining room It’s been set for three

John pauses Then removes one of the settings Mr Tyree
watches him from the kitchen but doesn’t say anything

IN THE DINING ROOM -- LATER

One of the lasagna trays is empty the other sits untouched
John’s just pushing his food around watching his Dad

JOHN
Guess you’re gonna have some
leftovers for once

Mr Tyree shrugs Considers the untouched lasagna

MR TYREE
Ill freeze that Have it next
Sunday

He nods to himself satisfied with his plan Then goes back
to his dinner John keeps watching him

JOHN
It’s been good Dad Being home
again

Mr Tyree looks up Has no idea what to say in response He
glances away out the window

MR TYREE
Hey John

John follows his gaze to see --

Savannah getting out of her car in their driveway John
glances at his Dad who just shoots him a look back

The look says well what are you waiting for
QUTSIDE --
John hurries out to greet Savannah

SAVANNAH
Got your note

She holds it up We still can’t see what it says

SAVANNAH

Short and to the point I like that
JOHN

Listen I’m really sorry--
SAVANNAH

I’m the one who needs to apologize

I had no business -- no John I

mean it I’m not a doctor I’m not
even close and I have no business
pretending like I am

John glances at the house Mr Tyree quickly turns back to
his dinner John SIGHS

JOHN
I’ve been watching him today

SAVANNAH
John Really I’m not a doctor I
have no idea what I’m talking about

She turns his head away from his Dad back towards her
SAVANNAH
I’m headed back to school but I
had to make sure You still taking
that jump with me

John grins relieved and kisses her

JOHN
Already did

Savannah pulls a sealed envelope out of her purse
SAVANNAH
You wrote your first letter to me
So I wrote my first one to you

John takes it starts to open it Savannah stops him

SAVANNAH
Don’t read it till I’m gone okay

John nods Tucks the note carefully in his back pocket Then
he takes Savannah by the hand and pulls her towards the house

JOHN
Come have some lasagna My Dad
made extra for you

SAVANNAH
I can’t stay long

John looks back at her Smiles sadly

JOHN
I know
MONTAGE OF IMAGES
INSIDE THE HOUSE -- Mr Tyree John and Savannah sit down to

eat together

SAVANNAH’ S VOICE
Dear John

AT HER CAR -- John and Savannah make out like teenagers

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Two weeks together That’s all it

took
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE -- Mr Tyree is watching John -- whos
watching Savannah -- who’s driving away

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Two weeks for me to fall for you

IN SAVANNAH’S CAR -- Tears fall down her face as she watches
John disappear in the rearview mirror

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Now we have one year apart But
thats all itll take

AT THE BUS STATION -- John’s in uniform (green beret and all)
He shakes his father’s hand then boards the bus

SAVANNAHS VOICE
And whats one year apart after
two weeks like that together

INSIDE THE BUS -- John watches Mr Tyree make his way back to
his car head down avoiding everybody possible

SAVANNAHS VOICE
You told me you wanted to make me
promises Promises youd keep

John pulls out Savannah’s letter Carefully opens it taking
great care not to crease the pages (it’s obvious he’s read it
plenty of times already)

SAVANNAHS VOICE
But I only want one promise from you
during this year we spend apart

ON A PLANE NOW -- John’s in the middle seat between two other
uniformed soldiers

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Tell me everything

It’s dark and everybody in the cabin except John is sleeping

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Write it all down John Scribble
it in a notebook Type it out
Email it to me I don’t care But
I want to know everything

John is unable to sleep He flips on the overhead light (the
only one on in the whole cabin) He carefully pulls out
Savannah’s letter unfolds it reads it again

SAVANNAHS VOICE
That way well be with each other
all the time -- even if were not
with each other at all And somehow
well get through this Together
He turns to the very last page The very last sentence is

SAVANNAH’ S VOICE
So well talk soon then

John runs his finger over it

JOHN
We’1l talk soon then

ON THE PLANE -- as it touches down in the afternoon sun

ON THE TARMAC -- John exits the plane shields his eyes from
the glare Walks down the staircase onto the GERMAN SOIL
beneath a massive Army Base in Stuttgart Germany

IN A BARRACKS -- John walks in to find the rest of his 12 MAN
TEAM here as well all unpacking from their leave

John greets everybody warmly -- they’re clearly a close-knit
unit Staff Sargeant Tony Butler (nicknamed Noodles) WHOOPS
when he sees John John grins back at him

JOHN
Noodles How was Atlantic City
NOODLES
Ugh You don’t wanna know
JOHN
C’mon How’s Shante doing
NOODLES
Ugh I don’t wanna know
JOHN
You’re kidding You two are already
over
NOODLES

Two grand on calling cards over the
past six months down the drain Very
little return on investment there my
accountant will not be pleased
(off John’s grin)

Hey but the good news is-- I’m back
I’m single again Come on you and
me prowling the streets of Germany
together Sprechen Sie Deutsch

John doesn’t answer and Noodles can immediately read it
all over his face

NOODLES
Ah shit You met a girl
(off John’s face)
Son of a -- you’re kidding me
John the girl You met the girl
In two weeks

John shrugs -- what can he say Noodles smirks

NOODLES
Yeah yeah whatever I’ve been
there before -- well see what
you’re saying six months from now

JOHN
I’m not like you Noodles I don’t
fall in love with every girl who
gives me a blow job and a smile

NOODLES
C’mon We both know they don’t need
to smile
(off John’s look)
Look I’m happy for you I am I’m
just saying we’ll see how happy you
are six months from now that’s all

John shrugs again -- he knows what he knows Then he turns
back to his bag but just as he starts to unload his gear --

VOICE FROM BEHIND
Don’t bother unpacking guys

John turns to find that CAPTAIN JASON STONE has entered the
barracks No one salutes him -- no need they’re not that
kind of unit -- but everyone does GROAN

Stone just shrugs And so then the MONTAGE begins again --

AT THE ASSCRACK OF DAWN -- as the 12 Green Berets load their
gear onto a small turboprop plane

JOHNS VOICE
Dear Savannah I promise

UP IN THE AIR -- While the rest of his team sleeps John
concentrates on writing this letter to Savannah

JOHN’S VOICE
I promise Ill write all the time
I promise Ill tell you everything
But be patient with me because it
may take a while for these letters
to get back to you

IN A BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER NOW -- the men look out over the
barren African landscape

JOHNS VOICE
Weve already been dispatched out
on a field assignment

THE HELICOPTER TOUCHES DOWN -- in an empty dirt field A
shirtless AFRICAN BOY watches them file off the copter

JOHNS VOICE
The problem is the local postal
service here does not appear to be
all that reliable

JOHN AND THE MEN -- walk through an African “neighborhood”
(in the loosest sense of the word) John stares at a mail
box in front of a “house” which is toppled over in the dirt

INSIDE THE DESERTED HOUSE -- John walks in The light switch
doesn’t even work There’s no electricity at all

JOHNS VOICE
Internet connections do not appear
all that reliable either so Ill
have to send everything from here
out by airmail

ON ANOTHER COPTER -- dropping off FOOD and SUPPLIES for the
troops John pulls the letter out of his pocket hands it to
the AIRMAN shouts instructions over the WHIR OF THE CHOPPER

JOHNS VOICE
And unfortunately it’s against
regulations for me to tell you
exactly where ‘here’ is

JOHN’S LETTER -- is thrown into a batch of other letters
wheeled into a MILITARY POST OFFICE

JOHNS VOICE
Not that I care about regulations
But the Lieutenant in Germany whos
probably reading this does

IN A WINDOWLESS ROOM -- an AMERICAN LIEUTENANT armed with
nothing but a letter opener skims through John’s letter

JOHNS VOICE
Guten Tag Lieutenant

The Lieutenant rolls his eyes

IN THE BELLY OF ANOTHER CARGO PLANE -- John’s letter sits
atop a huge pile of other mail

JOHNS VOICE
So all I can tell you is that the
place weve been sent makes me miss
America very much

IN A US POST OFFICE -- John’s letter is sorted and stacked

JOHNS VOICE
The lack of anything resembling a
tree makes me miss North Carolina

A MAILMAN -- takes a sip of his morning coffee unlocks his
truck It’s packed with mail already preloaded He SIGHS
turns on the engine starts another day

JOHNS VOICE
The lack of anything resembling an
ocean makes me miss Wilmington

ON A WALL OF COLLEGE POSTBOXES -- Savannah casually opens up
box number 232 pulls out a bill a catalog a magazine

JOHNS VOICE
And everything around me makes me
miss you

then finally John’s letter Savannah’s face lights up
She drops the rest of the mail rips it open And the
MONTAGE ENDS

ON THE CAMPUS GREEN -- DAY

Savannah sits on a bench outside a lecture hall reading
John’s letter until she’s interrupted by

RANDY
Wow You’re in this class I’m in
this class

She looks up at him evenly

SAVANNAH
I can’t remember ever seeing you

He gives her an easy grin
RANDY
That’s because I can’t remember

ever actually coming

IN HISTORY CLASS -- LATER

Savannah sits next to Randy listening to the PROFESSOR
lecturing about The Battle of the Bulge

The accompanying slides of war are brutal and jarring
Savannah stares at them her mind racing

ON A SLIDE -- of a WWII soldier staring past the camera
bundled up in full uniform heavy snow falling around him

BUT BACK IN AFRICA --

-- John is a study in contrasts There’s no snow here
nothing close and John’s not even wearing a uniform

But he’s just as uncomfortable John swats at an ENORMOUS
FLY sweating uncontrollably as he stands with his team in
front of a hundred AFRICAN REBELS

But Stone overlooks John as he sends the rest of the team out
on their individual assignments So John steps up

JOHN
Hey Captain

CAPTAIN STONE

Ammo duty Tyree and son No

ranks in the field okay
John nods then heads off into the sweltering heat
LATER -- TIME PASSES (OVER SCORE) AS --
-- the soldiers separate the Rebels into groups One group
learns how to load a gun One group learns how to shoot
One group learns the art of camouflage

LATER --

-- John sits on a porch next to Sargeant Don Rooney (100
Mississippi hick nicknamed ROOSTER) enjoying some idle time

John writes a letter to Savannah while Rooster watches some
native boys play soccer Two nearby AFRICANS watch Rooster

Rooster spits out a giant HUNK OF CHEW The other men copy
him exactly They are quick studies

ON THE BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER -- THE NEXT WEEK

As John hands the pilot two of his letters to Savannah

JOHN
Got any mail from the States

HELICOPTER PILOT
Sorry Probably’1l be in the air
drop
The Pilot gets back in the chopper prepares it for takeoff

AT THE SUPPLY DROP -- DAYS LATER

Two dirt clouds settle Noodles and John unpack the booty
Noodles finds the correspondence folder first

NOODLES
Let’s see nothing for me nothing
for me what a surprise
(then he gets to the end)
Sorry man Nothing for you either

John reacts His disappointment is obvious

ANOTHER DROP -- A WEEK LATER

Noodles sorts through the letters again then looks up at
John apologetically John’s confused

JOHN
But it’s been two weeks

Noodles shrugs It’s not much consolation
ANOTHER DROP -- A WEEK LATER

Noodles sorts through the letters once again John looks on
anxiously Noodles glances up from the folder downbeat

-but then he grins and holds up SEVEN LETTERS all from
Savannah John can’t help it -- he grabs Noodles hugs him

IN NORTH CAROLINA --

Savannah lays in bed writing John one of those letters

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Dear John Im back at my parents
ranch for the weekend and they have
some other houseguests you may know

VOICE FROM DOWNSTAIRS
Savannah They’re here

Savannah carefully puts the letter aside hurries DOWNSTAIRS--

--to find Tim and Alan there with her MOTHER and FATHER Alan
sprints over to Savannah and she lifts him into a hug

OUTSIDE -- LATER
Savannah and Alan ride horses side by side

SAVANNAH’ S VOICE
I took Alan out riding with me today
It was his first time on a horse

They’re moving at a slow trot but Alan WHISPERS SOMETHING to
his horse and the horse starts to canter Savannahs a
little worried at first but Alan’s in complete control

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Youve heard of horse sense -- how
horses are somehow able to sense
danger to sense out evil Well I
think autistic kids have that too

As they start to gallop Savannah watches the horse WHINNY
once to Alan It makes Alan smile

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Alan didnt really say very much and
his horse didnt either But they
understood each other perfectly

BACK AT SAVANNAH’S PARENTS HOUSE --

Tim watches in amazement as Alan eats ice cream LAUGHS at
something Tim leans over to Savannah nods at his son

TIM
I’ve never seen him like this I’ve
never seen him this relaxed

Savannah watches Alan A smile grows on her face

SAVANNAHS VOICE
So I have this idea This dream I
want to open up a camp a summer
camp for autistic kids A place
where they can learn how to take
care of horses And the horses can
learn how to take care of them

She watches Alan laughs to herself Her eyes become moist

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Whaddaya think Pipe dream huh

IN AFRICA -- NIGHTTIME

John rests against a fence Savannah’s seven letters spread
around him He finishes the letter we just heard

Nearby two of the other soldiers BERRY and STARKS listen
to American music with some of the Africans Lady Marmalade
is playing and the Africans do not seem too impressed

John watches them for a second then pulls out his pen
JOHNS VOICE
Dear Savannah I got seven of your
letters all at once this morning
So its been a very good day

BACK IN NORTH CAROLINA --

Savannah reads this letter under a poplar tree on campus

JOHN’S VOICE
But we both might want to number
our letters from here on out just
in case this happens again

A FRIEND sits next to her Savannah doesn’t even look up

JOHNS VOICE
And no Its not a pipe dream
Its a perfect dream

QUICK MONTAGE -- AS MONTHS PASS --
Of John and Savannah reading writing mailing

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Letter number ten Dear John
Letter number fifteen Letter
number twenty-one

John takes great care to save each letter keeping them in a
careful stack that is already a few inches high

JOHNS VOICE (OVERLAP)
Letter number thirty-three Dear
Savannah The good news is weve
been sent somewhere new -- although I
cant tell you where that is either
Weider Guten Tag Lieutenant

ON A DESERTED ROAD --

John and his team trek through a depressing city that looks
vaguely Eastern European

JOHNS VOICE
The bad news is this new place
actually makes me miss the old place

ON THE MOON -- as John stares up at it

JOHNS VOICE
But it’s a full moon here tonight
which makes me think of you

He sticks his finger out covering the moon with his thumb--

JOHN’S VOICE
Because I know that no matter what
Im doing no matter where I am
this moon will always be the same
size as yours half a world away

WHILE BACK IN WILMINGTON --

Savannah is doing the exact same thing with her moon

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Dear John Most nights I fall asleep
worrying about you Wondering where
you might be out there But not
tonight

She’s on the pier again yards away from where they first met

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Tonight youre here with me

AT MR TYREE’S HOUSE --

Mr Tyree is in his office with his coins as usual when the
doorbell RINGS He looks up surprised

HE OPENS THE FRONT DOOR --

-- to reveal a smiling Savannah carrying a homemade pie

SAVANNAHS VOICE
I visited your Dad yesterday
Summers almost over and I wanted
to see him before I went back to
school again I hope thats okay

AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE --

Mr Tyree sets two places

SAVANNAHS VOICE
He made me dinner -- it was Sunday
so we had lasagna -- and I got him
talking about his coins so we had
plenty of conversation

IN HIS OFFICE --
Mr Tyree takes Savannah on another tour of his collection

MR TYREE
This one’s kind of a cull so you
have to look really close to see the
double indentation but it’s there

SAVANNAH
A cull

MR TYREE
Yeah it’s what the ones in really
bad shape are called Coins are
normally graded on a scale from 0
to 70 but culls are below zero
the bottom of the barrel They’re
basically worthless to collectors

SAVANNAH
But not to you

MR TYREE
No Not to me

Savannah watches Mr Tyree sort through his coins

SAVANNAH
Do you have a favorite Out of all
of these is there one that’s your
absolute favorite

MR TYREE
(without much hesitation)
The ‘78 Jefferson mule Definitely

He opens his desk door carefully removes the glass encased
nickel (though it looks more like a penny) shows it off

SAVANNAH
Why this one Is it worth the most

MR TYREE
It’s worth a lot Not the most

SAVANNAH
Must be a good story behind it huh

Mr Tyree shrugs his face drawn

MR TYREE
Not really my story to tell

SAVANNAH
Well whose story is it then

SOMEWHERE IN EASTERN EUROPE --

John sits outside finishing up Savannah’s letter

SAVANNAHS VOICE
So Ill ask you instead John
wherever you may be

The last words on the page are Whats the story

John grimaces Looks around at his surroundings Then
dutifully picks up a pen and paper and starts to write

JOHNS VOICE
Dear Savannah Only because I did
promise to tell you everything

AT AN ICE CREAM SHOP -- FLASHBACK

YOUNG JOHN buys a double scoop of mint chocolate chip The
MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER hands John his change

JOHNS VOICE
When I was seven years old I
bought an ice cream cone

DOWN THE STREET --

John passes a SURF SHOP and a vending machine selling bouncy
balls for a quarter John digs in his pocket for some change

JOHNS VOICE
On my way home I noticed one of the
pennies -- wasn’t actually a penny

He ignores the penny at first goes for the quarter then
stops takes a second look

BACK AT HIS FATHER’S HOUSE --

Mr Tyree holds the penny up to the light He is perplexed

AT A FLEA MARKET --—

A COIN DEALER holds the penny under a magnifying glass now

Through the glass (although John and his father can’t see
this) the Dealer’s eye WIDENS But when he looks up at them
his expression is normal -- bored even

COIN DEALER

It’s a mule

(off their blank stares)
A mule An error coin Every now and
then they make a mistake a batch
accidentally slips through This one--
head’s a penny tail’s a nickel
Thing’s a mule They’re really more
of a novelty than anything else

The Dealer SIGHS lazily opens up his cash register

JOHNS VOICE
Remember the horse sense you were
talking about

COIN DEALER
Tell you what Since the kid found
it I’ll buy it anyway 20 bucks

He winks at John who’s thrilled But Mr Tyree isn’t

MR TYREE
No thank you

He abruptly walks away John’s bummed-- he was already
spending that twenty bucks in his head The Dealer CALLS
after them but Mr Tyree does not turn around

JOHNS VOICE
Well my Dad has it too

AT ANOTHER COIN SHOP --

A SECOND DEALER’s eye widens under his own magnifying glass

SECOND DEALER
I‘1l be damned you know what this
is You know how much this is worth

Mr Tyree and John shake their heads The Second Dealer digs
through a pile nearby (there are piles of everything stacked
everywhere) finally finds what he’s looking for

It’s a clipped magazine article called THE HOLY GRAIL OF
MULES John and his Dad flip through it see sentences like

---one of the rarest US minted mules in existence
--has fetched up to four thousand dollars at auction

And right next to the article is a picture of their exact
same coin Now it’s Johns’ turn for his EYES TO WIDEN

SECOND DEALER
Listen I’1ll give you the full four
grand for that thing right now But--
you want some advice Dad to Dad

Mr Tyree glances up at him but doesn’t say a word

SECOND DEALER
Keep it Just hold on to it Pass
it down to your son have your son
pass it down to his son and forty
fifty one hundred years from now
Youll have something worth much
more than four grand I promise you

Mr Tyree considers him Then looks down at John
deferentially lets him know -- this one’s up to you

John pauses and then he grins back at his Dad
AT A COIN SHOW --
Rows and rows of dealers John and Mr Tyree scour them all
JOHNS VOICE
At first I loved it chasing after
these mules with my father We
finally had something to talk about

something we could do together

ANOTHER COIN SHOW --

John has grown 12 YEARS OLD now and is much more interested
in the baseball cards at the next display case

Mr Tyree’s focus is unwavering though He points a dealer
to one mule in particular pulls out his wallet

JOHNS VOICE
But he became obsessed with them
You know how he is

ANOTHER COIN SHOW --

-- where John FIFTEEN now can barely hide his contempt

JOHNS VOICE
Then I became a teenager And you
know how I am

BACK AT HOME --

EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD JOHN opens an OLD GREEN REFRIGERATOR and
drinks some milk out of the gallon

JOHN
I’m not driving all the way up to
Wooster for another goddamn coin
show Dad Jesus

Mr Tyree stands silently at the doorway his coat already on

JOHN
You spend all our money on those
stupid coins How about you buy a
fridge that works for chrissakes

John shuts the fridge walks past him into the living room
and doesn’t see the hurt that creases his father’s face

IN HIS OFFICE -- LATE AT NIGHT
Mr Tyree sequesters himself away with his growing collection

JOHNS VOICE
Eventually he stopped talking about
coins with me altogether

The front door OPENS Mr Tyree turns hopefully

JOHNS VOICE
And when that happened we found
there just wasnt all that much left
to talk about

-but then he hears John walk into his bedroom and SHUT THE
DOOR Mr Tyree looks down at their ‘78 Jefferson nickel mule

JOHNS VOICE
So that’s the story I miss you so
much it hurts

ON CAMPUS -- BACK IN THE PRESENT

It is morning and the campus is still sleepy Savannah
reads John’s letter under her poplar tree as usual and when
she finishes she looks up affected by it

There’s a group of people gathered around a TV in the nearby
cafeteria No one speaks Their body language seems off

Something is wrong Savannah gets up to see what’s the matter

IN EASTERN EUROPE --

Ten time zones to the east John’s late for dinner He
pushes open a door walks into their makeshift mess hall

--but no one’s eating They’re all gathered around a small
TV here too John heads over to take a peek He’s confused
at first not understanding what he’s looking at

JOHN
What is that Is that the Empire
State Building

STARKS
No Tyree That’s the World Trade
Center

The rest of the team stares at the TV takes in these images
that we cannot see

No one speaks No one says another word

IN STUTTGART GERMANY -- DAY

John and the rest of the team sit in a briefing room
FALL 2001
Captain Stone walks in

CAPTAIN STONE
Just got off the phone with C-Team
We ship out on Thursday

ROOSTER
About damn time lLet’s go kick
some Afghani ass

CAPTAIN STONE
We’re not going to Afghanistan
Don We’re going to Serbia

NOODLES
Serbia What the hell’s in Serbia

Stone shrugs Stays perfectly calm

CAPTAIN STONE
Our orders

IN A SMALL ATRPLANE -- DAY

It’s a bumpy ride and the plane is too small for twelve
people Captain Stone stands up front to address his troops

CAPTAIN STONE
Okay listen up As you guys know
the world’s changed a whole heck of
a lot in the past three weeks

The plane hits a big air pocket Stone grimaces through it

CAPTAIN STONE
The Army has asked anyone who’s up
for separation within the next year
to reenlist for another tour right
now At this point reupping is still
voluntary I want to stress that And
this doesn’t even apply to all of us--
personally I’m not eligible to leave
till next December

He pauses looks around at his troops
CAPTAIN STONE
But I reupped this morning anyway
Now if any of you would like to
follow suit let me kn--

ROOSTER
I’m not goin nowhere Captain

OTHERS
Neither am I Me neither

One by one the soldiers all volunteer to reenlist

In the back of the plane the last two to speak up John and
Noodles trade a heavy look Then Noodles shrugs

NOODLES
What’s two more years I’m in too

ON JOHNS FACE -- heavy and tortured

THE TOP OF A BUNK BED -- NIGHT

All the other soldiers SNORE around him but John just stares
up into space his face just as heavy and just as tortured

IN A BATHROOM MIRROR -- MORNING

John brushes his teeth staring at his reflection his face
still the same There’s a KNOCK on the door

CAPTAIN STONE
I need to talk to you

John follows him out into the hall

JOHN
I need to talk to you too Listen--

CAPTAIN STONE
I’m putting you on the next plane
back to Germany

JOHN
What Why

CAPTAIN STONE
You’ve been granted a week of
emergency leave I tried to get you
more but it’s just tough right now

JOHN
Emergency leave What happened

Captain Stone pauses Looks him in the eyes

CAPTAIN STONE
It’s your father John

ON AN AIRPLANE --
Flying over the Atlantic Ocean not a cloud in the sky

INSIDE THE AIRPLANE --

John stares out the window down into the water

AT AN AIRPORT IN NORTH CAROLINA --

John’s plane touches down on the runway

IN A STERILE YELLOW WAITING AREA --

Savannah sits in an uncomfortable chair distractedly
flipping through a magazine without actually reading it

Then her cell phone RINGS -- she snatches it up answers it
immediately

SAVANNAH
John Have you landed

BACK ON THE PLANE --

The main door opens and passengers begin to de-board John
cell phone up to his ear politely but firmly forces his way
through the mass of people

JOHN
How is he

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
He’s fine I was just with him

JOHN
He’s fine What do you mean by fine

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
I mean he’s recovering The heart
attack was followed by a minor
stroke -- minor John minor no
permanent effects It’s good news
I promise The doctor says he’s
recouping ahead of schedule -- they
think they’re actually gonna
release him in a couple days

John steps out of the corridor arm into the terminal Relief
washes over his face

JOHN
So he’s okay

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
He’s okay

John finally smiles hurries through the bustling terminal

JOHN
Alright I just have to get my bags
and catch a cab and I’1l1 be there
I‘1ll see you in a half hour or so--

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
John I’m here

John freezes looks around at all the strangers around him
He searches everywhere but she’s nowhere to be found

JOHN
What do you mean you’re here

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
I mean I’m here at the airport
They won’t let anybody go to the
gates anymore after what happened
but I’m here I’m by baggage claim

John looks up He’s standing a few yards away from an
escalator and above it is a sign reading BAGGAGE CLAIM BELOW

He’s suddenly gripped with the realization he’s actually
about to see her again He swallows hard

JOHN
Well II guess Ill see you ina
minute then

DOWN AT BAGGAGE CLAIM --

Savannah’s in the same sterile yellow waiting area as before
but now we notice a luggage conveyor behind her which has
just switched on She smiles widely giddy at the idea

SAVANNAH
I’‘1l see you in a minute then

She hangs up the phone stares at the escalator in front of
her Lets it sink in she’s actually about to see him again
And then the smile immediately wipes off her face too

She turns and hurries into the bathroom

IN A BATHROOM UPSTAIRS --

John splashes water on his face Stares at his reflection
He’s tired and it shows -- he’s definitely looked better

Nothing he can do about it now though He nervously glances at
the bathroom door knows he has to walk through it eventually

IN A BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS --

Savannah touches up her makeup covers up a blemish that
nobody but her would ever notice

Nothing else she can do about it now either She looks at
her bathroom door knows she has to walk back through it too

OUTSIDE THE DOOR --

Savannah nervously walks out of the bathroom looks up at the
escalator The stairs roll downwards but nobody’s on them
Savannah can’t take her eyes off the empty escalator

Then finally -- a pair of feet appear -- and her heart jumps
in her chest The rest of John follows

They make eye contact Savannah’s eyes fill with tears
She’s thrilled and scared at the exact same time

John’s eyes fill with relief She’s even more beautiful than
he remembered

As soon as he steps off the escalator Savannah is there
hugging him hard holding on tight refusing to let go

IN THE CAR -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER
Savannah drives John’s beside her Neither of them speak

Instead Savannah habitually flips through the radio stations
One after another after another indiscriminately jumping
between DJ’s and commercials and perfectly good songs

Finally after the tenth flip in as many seconds John gently
grabs her hand Savannah knows he can sense her nervousness

SAVANNAH
Sorry

John smiles over at her but doesn’t speak Which doesn’t do
much to calm Savannah’s nerves The silence lingers on way
too long for her comfort so finally she blurts out the first
thing that pops in her head --

SAVANNAH
So Feel good to be back

John looks at her still doesn’t answer Savannah grimaces
knows that was a stupid question under the circumstances

SAVANNAH

I’m sorry Wow I don’t God

(after a pause)
You know every time I sat down to
write you a letter I’d think -- what
I wouldn’t give to be able to say
all those words to you in person
But now here you are and I can’t
think of a single good thing to say

John squeezes her hand Looks out the window

JOHN
It’s okay I don’t mind the silence

She looks over at him watches him stare out at nothing

AT NEW HANOVER HOSPITAL -- A HALF HOUR LATER

John stares into his father’s room with an equally blank look
on his face

Inside Mr Tyree is asleep in a hospital bed surrounded my
medical equipment frailer than he’s ever been

Savannah sees how uncomfortable John is takes him by the
hand

SAVANNAH
Let’s wake him up I know he wants
to see you

But John doesn’t budge He just stands there in the hallway
staring at his Dad until he finally shakes his head

JOHN
Nah Might as well let him sleep a
little more

IN THE HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- LATER

John’s walking Savannah to her car
SAVANNAH
I want to stay though I do If it
wasn’t for this stupid midterm
JOHN
Savannah Please don’t feel guilty
Youve done too much already

Savannah eyes him Sees the bags under his eyes

SAVANNAH
You okay

JOHN
Yeah It’s just it’s just been
one hell of a month
Savannah kisses him Opens her door
SAVANNAH
I’1l be back after my parent’s
party okay
John nods She touches his scar smiles at him
SAVANNAH
I hate the circumstances But I’m
so glad you’re home

She gets in her car John watches her drive away

IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM -- A FEW DAYS LATER

John and a Nurse help a very frail Mr Tyree into a
wheelchair John pushes him out into the hallway

BACK AT HOME --

Mr Tyree sits on the couch watching John make Saturday
meatloaf in the kitchen His expression is tough to read

IN THE DINING ROOM --

John and Mr Tyree eat slices of meatloaf Mr Tyree pauses

MR TYREE
How much salt did you add

JOHN
Three teaspoons Like you told me

MR TYREE
I said two teaspoons

Mr Tyree takes another bite anyway He does not however
look up at his son

IN MR TYREE’S BEDROOM --

Mr Tyree is in bed under the covers John’s by the door

JOHN
Anything else I can get you

MR TYREE
No Goodnight John

John flips off the light

JOHN
‘Night Dad

THE NEXT DAY --

John’s in the kitchen making dinner again Mr Tyree
hobbles in looks over John’s shoulder at his work

MR TYREE
John it’s pasta then meat then
cheese then pasta again

JOHN
That’s what I’m doing

Mr Tyree doesn’t respond Instead he steps up next to John
takes the meat himself and starts spreading a new layer

MR TYREE
You follow with the ricotta

John does as he’s told
MR TYREE

Evenly now spread it even Good
That’s good

Pull away from John and Mr Tyree father and son standing
side by side finishing the lasagna together

IN THE DINING ROOM -- LATER

They eat in silence

MR TYREE
You should go see her

John looks up at him Knows he’s talking about Savannah

JOHN
Nah I’m here to take care of you

MR TYREE
I can take care of myself

He doesn’t glance up continues to avoid eye contact
MR TYREE
You only have a few days left Why

are you wasting them with me

JOHN
I’m not wasting them Dad

MR TYREE
Yes you are

Mr Tyree cuts himself a second portion of lasagna John just
stares at him unsure whether he should be touched or hurt

ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS -- THE NEXT DAY

Savannah’s walking to class with Randy when she sees --

John leaning up against a nearby building She nearly faints
from shock then recovers and runs over kisses him hard

SAVANNAH
What are you doing here

JOHN
My Dad kinda sent me actually

SAVANNAH
You’re kidding How’s he doing

But John doesn’t answer -- he’s too busy looking past her
where Randy’s doing a bad job of pretending not to watch them

JOHN
What you hang out with that guy now

SAVANNAH
Ah he’s not so bad We’ve become
friends-- he’s actually pretty funny

Savannah gently grabs his head moves his eyes back to her
SAVANNAH
Are you really here Can you really
come with me this weekend My
parents want to meet you so badly

JOHN
Of course I can

She kisses him again thrilled then takes him by the hand
SAVANNAH
C’mon There’s somewhere I want to
take you

John grins right now he’d follow her anywhere But --

AT A COLLEGE BAR -- THAT NIGHT

The smile has left John’s face by now as he’s introduced one
by one to a table full of Savannah’s friends -- who all
happen to be college FRAT-TYPE GUYS

Somebody makes an inside joke that John doesn’t get and
everybody LAUGHS Savannah loudest of all John just downs
his beer and CHUCKLES too because it seems like he should

Savannah sees her friend Susan nearby and goes to say hello
leaving John momentarily alone The FRAT GUY nearest him
leans in tries to start polite conversation

FRAT GUY
So you’re Savannahs boyfriend
(off John’s nod)
That’s cool Where do you go again
You’re out of state right

John pauses decides it’s not worth it to correct him

JOHN
Right

FRAT GUY
Somewhere up north wasn’t it I’m
blanking -- Michigan Penn State

The guy’s making an honest mistake obviously confusing him
with somebody else but John resents it anyway -- resents the
question resents the guy asking it resents having to
backtrack now He levels an icy glare across the table

JOHN
I’m in the army actually

FRAT GUY
(realizing his mistake)
Oh I mustve I’m sorry

Now anger really begins to boil up inside John He eyeballs
the guy hard challenging him now

JOHN
For what

The Frat Guy’s no pushover though and he meets John’s eye
contact shoots back a ‘what’s your problem’ look

But before anything can escalate Savannah wraps her arms
around John’s neck and kisses him on the cheek She says
something but the din of the rowdy table drowns her out

SAVANNAH
I’m so glad you’re finally getting
to meet everybody

JOHN
What

SAVANNAH
I’M SO GLAD YOU’RE FINALLY MEETING
EVERYBODY

JOHN
Me too How long we staying
(off her look)
I’m just hoping to spend some time
with you without the frat pack here

SAVANNAH
Relax You’re coming home with me
They aren’t

John raises his eyebrows Savannah shakes her head
SAVANNAH

Don’t get any ideas I’m still the
same girl you left behind

JOHN
I hope so
SAVANNAH
What
JOHN

I SAID I HOPE SO

John meant it to be flirty but when he yelled it the second
time it sure didn’t come off that way

Savannah gives him a look that’s hard to read at first then
she shrugs it off and nods towards his empty glass

SAVANNAH
Go get another beer soldier

UPBY THE BAR -- LATER

The place is crowded and the bartenders are understaffed and
overworked John isn’t having much luck waving one down

RANDY
Whatcha drinking

Randy sidles up next to John

JOHN
Just a beer Good luck getting
somebody’s attention though

RANDY
Billy Two Hef’s

Down the bar BILLY THE BARTENDER nods immediately goes to
get their beers Randy shrugs by way of explanation

RANDY
I’m here way too much
(re John’s money)
Put that away Please

Billy brings them their drinks along with two shots on the
house Randy winks holds a shot out to John

RANDY
Listen I want to apologize For
the way I treated you before

John tries to wave him off

RANDY
No no If I had any idea she was
actually gonna stay with you I’d
never have acted like that

Randy CHEERS him and downs the shot but John hesitates
before he follows suit trying to figure out whether he’s
just been paid a compliment or an insult

RANDY
Yo Billy Two more just like that

BACK AT SAVANNAH’S APARTMENT -- LATE THAT NIGHT

John and Savannah make out as they stumble through the door
Something is undeniably off between them now though -- it’s
like they’re both trying just a little bit too hard

Plus John is more than just a little bit drunk Savannah pulls
away from him nervously heads over to her refrigerator

SAVANNAH
Um you want something to drink
or

John leans over her looks into the fridge

JOHN
Any beer in there

There’s juice water diet coke But no beer

SAVANNAH
Nope Still don’t drink remember

John sighs totters slightly into the living room

JOHN
And yet we spent all night at a
bar

SAVANNAH
Sorry

John turns waves it away

JOHN
I said it was hot tonight at the
bar Sorry if I’m a little sweaty

He smiles at her again Strides back towards her attempting
to be seductive but not entirely succeeding

SAVANNAH
It’s okay I’m sweaty too
(nervously as he kisses her)
Maybe I should take a shower

JOHN
You don’t need a shower

He kisses her again Moves in closer Savannah shuts her eyes
tight and then she ducks away

SAVANNAH
You know what Yeah I do I’m just
gonna go take a shower

IN HER BATHROOM --

After she turns on the water Savannah covers her face with
her hands and grimaces angry at herself for acting that way

TEN MINUTES LATER --

Freshly showered Savannah stares at her reflection Wet
hair no makeup It won’t do She grabs her cosmetics bag and
starts to go to work calls out into the living room --

SAVANNAH
John I‘1ll just be another minute

But there’s no answer Savannah peeks out through the door --
--sees John slumped over on the couch passed out

She sighs watches him sleep for a second Then she turns
back to the mirror and starts wiping the makeup off her face

IN THE LIVING ROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING

John stirs awake Looks around He’s on the couch with a
pillow and blanket And he’s got a pounding headache

He gets up On the table is a note read that reads
Dear John
Woke up this morning saw you pinched myself

Milk in the fridge be back by two

IN SAVANNAH’S ROOM -- LATER

John eats a bowl of cereal outside her room Her ROOM This
is where she lives This is where she sleeps

He hesitantly walks in Takes in the sheets the pictures
the furniture Then he glances at her bookshelf Stops on
one book in particular

AT A QUARTER AFTER THREE O’CLOCK --

John’s halfway through the book when the front door OPENS and
he hears Savannah enter

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
John Sorry I’m late but my
professor had an open slot for once
and I really needed to go over my
thesis with him and then I had to
take care of this huge scheduling
issue in the mentoring group that
I’m forming -- did I tell you I’m
forming a mentoring gr--

She walks into the bedroom sees the look on his face

SAVANNAH
Oh no You’ve been cooped up by
yourself in this tiny apartment all
day and you’re furious with me

JOHN
Nah I just shouldn’t have come
early that’s all I shoulda waited
till you weren’t so busy

Savannah grins at him throws her jam-packed bookbag onto the
bed next to him

SAVANNAH
Well then you’d be waiting an awful
long time

But John doesn’t smile back Then Savannah notices what he’s
reading (it’s a book on Autism and Aspergers)

They look at each other Savannah sits down beside him
Almost says something then decides not to She smiles
instead kisses him on the forehead

SAVANNAH
I’m so glad you came John I still
can’t believe it -- I wake up and

youre actually here I come home
and you’re actually here It still
doesn’t feel real to me yet

JOHN
I just wish we had more time that’s
all

SAVANNAH

One more night together But then
only five more months apart right

John looks away Savannah doesn’t notice pulls him up
SAVANNAH
Ten-hut Tyree We got a little bit

of a drive ahead of us

AT AN ESTATE IN LENOIR -- HOURS LATER

Savannah and John walk up to an old but still grand Southern
Colonial house Cars are parked all over the yard and above
the front door hangs a banner reading HAPPY 25TH ANNIVERSARY

They enter to find that the party is already in full swing

MRS CURTIS
My girl

Savannah’s MOTHER hurries over and throws her arms around
Savannah They’re obviously very close but then she
surprises John by hugging him just as vigorously

MRS CURTIS
And John I feel like I know you
already How’s your father

JOHN
Better Thank you for asking

MRS CURTIS
Of course He’s been in our prayers

John smiles unsure of how to respond

MRS CURTIS
I’m so glad you’re finally here
But I can’t say I envy you --
there’s a lot of people to meet
tonight Things could get ugly

SAVANNAH
I’ve been briefing him in the car
Background on family members
history of feuds that sorta thing

JOHN
Good intel Solid tactical training
I’m as ready as Ill ever be

Mrs Curtis grins at Savannah mouths “I love him already” to
her Then she links arms and leads them both into the fray

MRS CURTIS
Let’s get this show on the road then

IN THE PARTY —-

Mrs Curtis plays a great hostess introducing John to PARTY
GUESTS with Savannah by his side beaming

When Mrs Curtis tells somebody what John does for a living
GUESTS begins to come up to him and shake his hand thanking
him for his service John handles it all terrifically until

Randy passes him on the way to the bathroom

RANDY
Hey Shots on you tonight huh

He SLAPS John on the back as he walks by John doesn’t
respond just turns to Savannah after he’s gone

JOHN
What’s he doing here

SAVANNAH
(with a shrug)
I invited him

Before John can follow up he’s pulled aside by a treetrunk
of a MAN IN HIS LATE 40’S The people nearby (including TIM
and Tim’s FATHER) fall silent The Man glares at Savannah

MR CURTIS
So this is him

SAVANNAH
Daddy please Not the tough guy
routine this time okay

MR CURTIS

Routine I benchpress refrigerators
honey I shoot large animals for
sport Your boyfriends need to know
these things

Nearby John notices Tim smiling They trade a nod hello and
then John emboldened by a friendly face sticks his hand out

JOHN
Nice to meet you Mr Curtis And
for what it’s worth Tim’s already
threatened me with bodily harm if I
ever hurt your daughter

TIM
Yeah I was very convincing too
I’m sure I made quite an impact

Mr Curtis pausesthen grabs John’s hand pumps it heartily

MR CURTIS
Well if that’s the case then let’s
just skip right over that part and
get back to the drinking Cheers
son -- glad you could join us

He raises his glass just as an OLDER COUPLE walk in the front
door Mr Curtis waves at them instantly distracted

MR CURTIS
Billy ya egg sucking dog you
actually showed up

He heads over to greet them while Savannah and her Mother
get pulled into a nearby circle of WIVES That leaves John
and Tim pretty much alone They shake hands warmly

TIM
Good to see you again John

JOHN
You too Where’s Alan hiding at

TIM
He’s been riding horses all day so
he’s upstairs out cold

JOHN
Yeah I heard he’s a helluva jockey

TIM
It’s the craziest thing No
complaints here though

Another PARTY GUEST comes over to say hello to Tim

PARTY GUEST
Tim -- so nice to see you Where’s
your wife It’s been ages I
really must say hello

TIM
Oh she’s on vacation I‘11 let her
know you asked after her though

Tim holds a forced smile John watches him carefully long
after the Party Guest leaves and they’re left alone again

JOHN
Another vacation huh

Tim shrugs tries to play it off John considers biting his
tongue but then --

JOHN
Is that what you tell Alan too

Tim glances over at John Pauses

TIM
I don’t tell Alan anything
JOHN
He doesn’t ask
TIM
He asks I just don’t know how to

answer

John looks away Watches Savannah LAUGHING with her Mom at
one of the other women’s jokes

JOHN
Listen I’m not in any position to
give you advice Tim

Tim shrugs lets John know it’s okay to go on

JOHN
When I was a kid I woke up every
morning hoping today’d be the day my
mom would finally come home And it
took me fifteen years to realize
that was never gonna happen

John turns to Tim looks at him honestly

JOHN
As painful as it would’ve been for
my Dad to tell me the truth it

coulda saved me a lotta years of
waiting around you know

Tim looks back at him silently Not offended just thoughtful
Then another PARTYGOER butts in and breaks the silence

PARTYGOER
I’m sorry -- youre John right
Savannah’s John I just want to say
thank you For what you’re doing

JOHN
You’re welcome But I--

PARTYGOER
We’‘re praying for you Know that I
just hope it’s all over soon so you
boys can come home safe and sound

War talk always attracts men -- Mr Curtis and his friends
are no exception and they jump in freely

MR CURTIS
Oh this thing aint gonna be over
anytime soon Afghanistan’s just
the first stop of many believe me

A DEMOCRAT
He’s right Soon they’re gonna ask
y’all to reenlist for another tour
And then slowly but surely they’1ll
stop asking and start telling

JOHN
Theyve already requested we re-up
for two more years actually

A REPUBLICAN
I bet every soldier in the service
will do it too no questions asked

JOHN
Every soldier I know already has

Suddenly a VOICE FROM BEHIND cuts through the crowd

SAVANNAH
So you’re gonna reenlist For two
more years just like that

John turns to find Savannah behind him The rest of the
chatter dies down John pauses looks away

JOHN
It’ssomething we need to discuss

Some of the Men start to back up give Savannah some space --
she’s eyeballing John hard potentially about to blow

But she doesn’t Instead she flips a switch turns on a half-
convincing smile

SAVANNAH
Well Can I freshen up anybody’s
drink

LATER --

As Mr Curtis introduces John to yet another group of FRIENDS
John glances over to see Savannah deep in discussion with
Randy They’re out of earshot but she is serious and intense
Then Randy says something that makes her finally smile

She looks over at John They make eye contact Then they
both look away

QUT IN THE FRONT LAWN -- LATER

The cars have thinned out Only a few stragglers are left
IN THE HOUSE --

John watches Mr and Mrs Curtis show the last of their
guests to the door He turns heads --

QUT TO THE BACK DECK --

-- where Savannah is all alone staring out at the lake

JOHN
There you are Where’s Randy in
the bathroom popping his collar

SAVANNAH
No Randy went home a while ago

John wraps his arms around her trying to cut past the tension

SAVANNAH

Two more years John
JOHN

I know
SAVANNAH

It’s selfish of me to act like
this I get that This isn’t even
about me -- you’re the one who has
to make the sacrifice

JOHN
It’s your sacrifice too

She finally turns to John looks up at him tries to smile

SAVANNAH
What’s two more years apart after
those two weeks together right

She already knows what she has to say next She doesn’t look
away -- she has to say this in a way he can believe

SAVANNAH
I think you should do it I want
you to do it

JOHN
You sure

She smiles reassuringly but then stops She sees something
flash in his eyes and she immediately knows what it is

Relief Her heart drops into her stomach

SAVANNAH
Wait a minute -- you already have
Haven’t you You’ve already reupped

JOHN
No I--

SAVANNAH
Don’t lie to me That’s the one
thing you cannot do John Don’t
look me in the eye and lie to me

Inside the house Tim comes down the stairs carrying a
sleeping Alan in his arms

He steps out on the porch to say goodnight no idea what he’s
walking into John turns when he hears him

SAVANNAH
Don’t look at him John Look at me

JOHN
I--I had to okay Every single
one of the guys committed on the
spot Every single one--

SAVANNAH
I don’t care about them I care
about us What happened to
“together” John What happened to
the leap were taking “together”

JOHN
You don’t understand--

He tries to put his hand on her arm but she SLAPS it off

SAVANNAH
You son of a bitch Don’t ever tell
me I don’t understand

Then she turns and walks away Tim tries to inch back into the
house pretend like he was never here But John knows he is

JOHN
That’s the first time I’ve ever
heard her curse

Alan stirs in Tim’s arms but doesn’t quite wake
TIM
She’s angry because she loves you
that much Because she misses you
that much Trust me that’s a
lot better than the alternative

John watches Savannah get smaller and smaller as she heads
out towards the lake

JOHN
So what do I do

Tim carries Alan to the door looks back before he leaves

TIM
You go after her John

QUT BY THE LAKE -- LATER

This pier is much smaller than the one in Wilmington but as
John comes up behind Savannah it’s a very familiar sight
John pauses Tries to fin

JOHN

d the right words

I have a responsibility to those
guys okay Just like they have a
responsibility to me They cover
my back I cover theirs It’s the
only way the whole thing works

Savannah doesn’t turn to h

JOHN

im just stares out at the water

I did re-up But I didn’t do it

for my country

I didn’t do it for

some cause I did it for the eleven
guys standing beside me wherever we

go wherever we’

With that she finally turn

re sent

s looks him in the eye

SAVANNAH
How about the one girl standing in
front of you right now John

John can’t look back at he
whether it’s nerves or des
suddenly has a tough time

JOHN

r Something shifts inside of him --
peration he starts to sweat
catching his breath

You want me to deenlist Then I’11

deenlist I won’
plane tomorrow

t even get on the
I’1l go AWOL I don’t

care -- you’re all that matters to
me Okay You are all that matters

His voice turns intense h

JOHN

is eyes desperate

I just-- I don’t know what happened
I have no idea what happened I woke
up one day and skyscrapers were
suddenly falling down and people
were suddenly dying and a war

suddenly popped

up at the exact

moment that my Dad’s heart suddenly

stopped working
know what to do

right and I don’t
I have no clue what

to do I just know that I want it
all to go away so I can stay here

with you right

here with you for as

long as I possibly can

Savannah stares at John
of a sudden anxious and s
quickly melts away

He looks like he’s six years old all
cared and vulnerable Her anger

She puts her hand on his face trying to calm him down

JOHN
I’m just trying to do the right
thing here but I’1l tell you what
I’m so turned around I don’t have a
friggin idea what that is anymore
So you tell me Tell me what to
do Savannah Tell me what you
want me to do and Ill do it

She quietly wraps him up holds on as tight as she can Then
she kisses him lightly on the lips

SAVANNAH
I want you to come with me

INSIDE AN OLD STABLE --

Savannah leads John inside The place is empty now There
were horses here once but not anymore

She pulls John back to the far-most stable which is different
than the others There are stacks of hay but there are also
blankets a flashlight a bunch of paperbacks an old radio

SAVANNAH
Whenever I used to sneak out of the
house late at night this is
where I’d come

She looks through the open window at the house she grew up in
She smiles to herself the memories obviously flooding back

SAVANNAH
Kinda pathetic huh Even when I ran
away I never went very far

Then finally she shakes the nostalgia away turns to John
and pushes him down on the bed of hay She gets on top of
him slowly pulls her shirt off

John looks through the window up at the house It’s a distance
-- no one can see them here no one can hear them

Savannah turns on the radio The song that starts to play is
THE LUCKIEST by Ben Folds (download it give it a listen the
album it’s on happened to be released September 11th 2001)

Then she removes the rest of her clothes Takes his shirt
and his pants off John doesn’t breathe

JOHN
You sure about this

She nods John hesitates though still unsure

But Savannah isn’t She pulls him down to her helps to
guide him John gives in

Then over the music -- images

-- of them together

-- of John going slowly and gently but--

-- of a single tear falling down Savannah’s face

As the song continues to play over all the following scenes

OUTSIDE THE OPEN WINDOW -- PREDAWN

-- of Savannah sadly watching the moon disappear below the
horizon John asleep on a blanket behind her

THE NEXT MORNING --

-- of John rolling awake looking around realizing
Savannah’s already gone up to the house He’s all alone in the
stables and that worries him

IN THE CAR --
-- of John and Savannah silently driving back to Wilmington
AT THE AIRPORT --

-- of John saying goodbye to his hobbled father with a crisp
handshake then turning to Savannah He eyes her carefully

JOHN
Is everything okay Nothing
nothing’s changed between us has
it
She pulls him to her kisses him hard enough for Mr Tyree to
turn away Relieved John kisses her back having already
forgotten that she didn’t actually answer the question
JOHN
I’m not sure when my next leave will
be with everything going on

Savannah nods understanding

JOHN
But I’ll see you soon then

Savannah kisses him again Knows what her line is here

SAVANNAH
I’1l see you soon then

IN THE PLANE -- OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN

-- of John staring out the window into the night

IN SERBIA --

-- of a helicopter landing somewhere in Northern Kosovo

John steps out of the copter sees Noodles waiting in a
nearby jeep Noodles mock salutes him and John grins

IN A CITY IN KOSOVO --

-- of John reunited with his team as they watch UN troops (in
those familiar blue helmets) march through the city here to
aid the Serbs in peacekeeping efforts with the Albanians

AT BASE CAMP --

-- of John sorting through boxes and boxes of Small Arms
weapons futilely looking for the correspondence package

AT A MAKESHIFT HELIPAD --

-- of John coordinating the delivery of more supplies The
pilot knows what he really wants though and hands it over

John tears the package open-- smiles when he finds two letters
from Savannah

AT A BOMBED OUT ALBANIAN CONVENIENCE STORE --

-- of John and his team as they help an ALBANIAN COUPLE sort
through the rubble of their family business

John looks down Sees a small but pristine POCKET CALENDAR
amongst the debris He picks it up

JOHN
You mind if I have this

The ALBANIAN STOREOWNER waves him off His business is
ruined He could care less about a pocket calendar

BACK AT BASE CAMP --

-- of John ripping open a new correspondence package
thrilled when three letters from Savannah tumble out

IN HIS BUNK --
-- of John checking the dates on her letters making the

corresponding marks in his calendar Savannahs consistent
Seven days Seven days Seven days Like clockwork

John smiles Pulls out a clean sheet of paper And starts to
write Dear Savannah

CLOSE ON THE POCKET CALENDAR --

-- of the red X’s more than a year of them now all
consistently seven days apart

OUTSIDE CAPTAIN STONE’S ROOM --

-- of John making a spontaneous late night call on the
team’s new SATELLITE PHONE He types in all the digits
(there’s a whole slew of them) and hopes for the best

IN NORTH CAROLINA --

-- of Savannah’s cell phone silently VIBRATING on a desk It
rings so much it finally falls onto the floor and no one is
around to pick it up

BACK IN KOSOVO -- AT MIDNIGHT

-- of John on a picturesque hill staring up at the waxing
moon directly above him

A TIME LAPSE --
-- of John on this hill as days turn into weeks and weeks
turn into months as the moon and the sun fly over him

through the sky almost like they’re chasing each other

BLEEDING OVER THIS IS AN IMAGE --

-- of John’s pocket calendar panning past the red Xs week
after week and then suddenly the X’s stop

ON A CRATE NEAR THE HILL --

-- of John away from the rest of his team A few of the guys
are playing a game of poker outside the barracks but John is
off to the side staring down at the calendar

EIGHTEEN MONTHS have passed now but after 72 straight Red Xs
it’s been six weeks since the last one Clearly he’s worried

Suddenly there is a SUDDEN EXPLOSION within the city The Ben
Folds song abruptly cuts off A FIREBALL reaches into the sky

WINTER 2003
John jumps up heads over to the hill Some of the other
guys get up from their poker game and gather there as well to

take in this all too familiar scene

Then there is music to John’s ears the WHIR of an incoming
helicopter is heard as it becomes visible on the horizon

AT THE MAKESHIFT HELIPAD --

John anxiously greets the pilot as he touches down

JOHN
Please say you’ve got like seven
letters for me

The pilot digs into his bagbut pulls out only a SINGLE
LETTER It’s a familiar sight It’s got Savannah’s
handwriting on it It’s in her normal clean white envelope

But it brings John no comfort Instead this lone letter
scares him to death

OVER BY HIS CRATE -- LATER

John sits far enough away from the others to have privacy

Carefully he opens the envelope Unfolds both sheets of paper
inside This one begins as they always do Dear John

He takes a deep breath And then he reads the rest

ON JOHNS HANDS -- as they start to shake

ON JOHNS FACE -- as every muscle tenses

ON JOHNS EYES -- as he does not cry

ON JOHN -- sitting perfectly still on this crate reading and

rereading this letter all alone on the horizon

BACK IN BASE CAMP --

John ransacks Stone’s desk until he finds the satellite
phone He takes it starts pacing the room like an animal in
a cage going over in his mind what he’s going to say

Then he begins to dial He knows all the numbers by heart
and there’s a lot of them Fourteen in a row one after the
other but he stops before he hits the fifteenth

His finger hovers over the button but he can’t bring
himself to push it No matter how hard he tries

So instead he kicks a metal briefcase across the room
IN THE BARRACKS --

John barrels in a man on a mission Noodles nods hello as he
walks by their poker game but John’s too focused to notice

John pours all the stuff from his footlocker onto the ground
sorting through it until he finds what he’s looking for

QUTSIDE --

John takes all 112 of Savannah’s letters and dumps them out
loose on the ground What had been a carefully organized
chronological stack is now just a messy pile

John pulls out the flint and magnesium block from his pocket
and starts to shave the magnesium off over the letters

NOODLES
Need a lighter

Noodles has appeared behind him but John just shakes his head
focused only on the flint now A spark catches the magnesium
and the letters ignite John watches the fire spread

NOODLES
You wanna talk about it

John looks away Knows he’s being completely transparent
right now and hates himself for it

JOHN
Not much to talk about She found
somebody else Somebody who’s
there and not here

NOODLES
You know who it is

JOHN
She didn’t say But I have a
pretty good idea

The anger flashes in John’s eyes again

NOODLES
Don’t worry man you’ll get her
back As soon as you go home she’1l
come running -- you know it’s true

John stares into the fire wearily shakes his head

JOHN NOODLES
No It’s not
Trust me man this is what--
Noodles
I know what I’m talking ab--
Noodles They’re already
engaged Okay

That stops him cold He pauses unsure what to say

NOODLES
IJesus I’m sorry John

John doesn’t respond Instead he takes out Savannahs
breakup letter and drops it onto the flame watches it turn
into ashes along with the 112 letters that preceded it

IN THE CITY -- THE NEXT DAY

A mini-convoy navigates through the streets of Kosovo The
team is split into two and John drives the front humvee

Rooster is in the middle of a rant but John tunes him out
from his bubble focused only on the road ahead of him

ROOSTER
All I’m sayin is they recruit us
train us for five years tell us
were their goddamned best and
brightest and then a war breaks out
and they send us everywhere but
there Now what sense does that make

BERRY
Look around you man It aint like
were patrolling the Kansas State
Fair you know

Indeed up the road is a smoldering building It’s not
exactly a war zone but it’s not too far away either

ROOSTER
So what These aren’t the sons a
bitches that attacked us are they

As they get closer they can see that it’s a Serbian church
burning to the ground Three BODIES lie in the street and a
group of angry SERB CIVILIANS have gathered nearby

CAPTAIN STONE
No they’re just attacking each other
-- Daniels go see what happened

DANIELS their language guy gets out and converses in SERB
with one of the civilians Then he reports back to Stone

DANIELS
Molotov cocktail half hour or so
ago Good news is the church was
empty -- no casualties

CAPTAIN STONE
(re the bodies)
They probably beg to differ

DANIELS
Yeah well there was also an
Albanian sniper hiding somewhere up
in that building but--

Nearby three SERBIAN FIGHTERS unload a DShK (an old Soviet
anti-aircraft machine gun like the American Browning) into
the side of the building Daniels was pointing at The
already demolished structure gets that much more demolished

The Serbs grin flash them a cheery thumbs up

CAPTAIN STONE
Christ Are UN troops on the way

Daniels shrugs Stone SIGHS then opens the door steps out
CAPTAIN STONE
Berry Daniels go commandeer that

weapon Everybody else

INSIDE THE DEMOLISHED BUILDING --

The Berets enter systematically casing the first floor John
trails behind -- physically he’s here mentally not so much

They come upon the body of an OLDER ARMENIAN WOMAN This was
somebody’s grandmother It’s a tough sight even for them
Captain Stone turns away first quickly starts up the stairs

The others follow and Stone wordlessly split them into two
groups -- Stone takes half at the second floor while Starks
John Noodles and Rooster make their way up to the top floor

NOODLES
He always knows exactly what to say
in those situations doesn’t he I
wonder if he’s so inspirational
because he’s a Captain or if he
made Captain because he’s so
inspirational

STARKS
How about you ponder that dilemma
while you clear east Noodles
Rooster you take west I got north
(then to John)
Yo Tyree -- snap out of it and
clear south willya

John comes out of the clouds and does as he’s told He heads
to the back room scans left to right floor to ceiling

It’s clear He walks in flips a nearby light switch
expecting nothing but lo and behold the room lights up

JOHN
I‘1l be damned Electricity still w--

Suddenly a bullet SLICES into John’s left shoulder

His eyes widen but he’s too stunned to cry out A second
BULLET hits him in the gut and sends him to his knees

His hand flies to his stomach and he falls onto his back
His eyes search the dingy ceiling above him

Meanwhile Starks Noodles and Rooster charge into the room
guns blazing The wounded ARMENIAN hiding in the corner of
the room is riddled with dozens of bullets

Noodles finally stops firing kneels over John cuts open his
fatigues John desperately tries to make eye contact

NOODLES
Medic I need a medic up here

John draws a sharp breath GULPS for air His PUPILS begin to
DILATE as he stares up at the SKY

He GASPS again Try as he might he can’t hold on And as
his eyes finally close and the sound fades away --

EVERYTHING TURNS SILENT
EVERYTHING GOES BLACK

THEN FADE BACK IN

As John opens his eyes again He’s in a strange room The
walls are yellow cinderblock A NURSE is changing his IV

NURSE
Welcome back Sargeant Tyree

John struggles to get his bearings He tries to speak but
his mouth is parched and dry The Nurse turns his morphine
drip a notch higher
NURSE
Rest easy okay You’re alive and
that’s all that matters right now

But although John does not appear to agree and although he
fights as hard as he can to maintain consciousness --

-- it is ultimately a losing battle

IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM --

John abruptly sits upright in bed Weeks have passed --
obvious because his arm is now in a sling his stomach is
wrapped in gauze and his face is lined with impatience

He stands up goes into the small bathroom Stares at his
reflection in the mirror

Then he slowly pulls his arm out of the sling It causes him
immense pain but he pushes through

He grabs his dress uniform out of the closet Winces as he
buttons his shirt Tight Tighter still

Winces as he pulls on his rather sparsely decorated jacket
Winces as he tries to tie his tie with one good arm

By the time he puts on his beret his forehead gleams with
sweat He wipes his face stares at his reflection

At least now he looks like a soldier again

IN A MAKESHIFT OFFICE --

John stands at attention in front of Captain Stone who’s
catching up on some paperwork

JOHN
Requesting permission to return to
active duty sir

Stone looks up at John He’s trying hard to look whole and
healthy but he’s not fooling anybody

CAPTAIN STONE
It’s been three weeks son I’m
impressed but I’m not stupid

He turns back to his paperwork

CAPTAIN STONE
Why don’t you go home first get
some RandR Take as much time as you
need -- your family’s probably
worried sick about you

JOHN
My father’s just glad I’m okay sir

John’s not budging Stone glances back up at him then SIGHS
He puts down his pen and looks John honestly in the eye

CAPTAIN STONE
I’m being transferred John Back
home
(before John can object)
It has nothing to do with what
happened I put in for it months
ago I just miss my family is all

He stands up walks over to John

CAPTAIN STONE
Berry and Daniels have decided to
leave too everyone else is gonna
be reassigned Now you have less
than four months until separation
yourself You’ve served your country
well -- there’s no need to go the
extra mile at this point

John stands even straighter his eyes focused on the wall
behind Stone

JOHN
Requesting permission to officially
reup sir
Stone stares at him in disbelief
CAPTAIN STONE
Let me get this straight Staff
Sargeant I’m handing you a ticket
home and you’re telling me no
thanks cause you actually wanna go
back out there for another year
John doesn’t move still rigid as a board

JOHN
Better make it two sir

FADE TO
THE SUN --

Beating down from the sky John looks up at it shielding his
eyes from the glare He’s at --

AN ARMY BASE IN SAUDI ARABIA --

-- still in full uniform But now his once sparsely decorated
jacket is full of bars medals accommodations badges

John’s head is still shaved but his wounds have long healed
Four full years have passed and he’s in his late 20s now

An F-15 Eagle jet screams overhead blocking out the sun for
an instant and casting John in a brief shadow

SUMMER 2007

John watches it lands at a nearby airstrip After a moment a
PRIVATE appears behind John

PRIVATE
The Colonel’s ready for you now

IN A COMMAND CENTER --

COLONEL KITTRICK sits at a desk as John enters

COLONEL KITTRICK
Sargeant Major Tyree Have a seat

John does as he’s told

COLONEL KITTRICK
Heard you and your team did good
work in Algeria Must be hard to
believe it’s actually hotter here
than it was there idn’t it

John just smiles politely Kittrick gets the message and cuts
to the chase He opens up John’s folder

COLONEL KITTRICK
It’s come to my attention that you
haven’t taken leave in over nine
months That’s a terrible oversight
on our part I apologize on behalf
of the United States Army and I’m
rectifying it effective immediately

JOHN
Sargeant Swift hasn’t had one in
nearly as long why don’t you send
him instead

COLONEL KITTRICK
Sargeant Swift’s scheduled leave is
next month

JOHN
But sir--

COLONEL KITTRICK
I’m not sending Sargeant Swift I’m
sending you Go home son get some
rest Take a vacation for once

JOHN
I don’t need a va--

COLONEL KITTRICK
It’s not up for debate Sargeant
Major I promise you we’ll all
still be here when you get back

John hesitates Kittrick just nods towards the door

COLONEL KITTRICK
That’s all

AT THE AIRSTRIP IN SAUDI ARABIA -- TWO WEEKS LATER

A military plane flies up the runway goes airborne
IN THE AIRPLANE --

John sits in a jumpseat staring up at the plane’s ceiling
trying to ignore the bumpiness of the flight

AT THE WILMINGTON AIRPORT --

The escalator runs emptily Finally John’s feet appear The
rest of him follows

He looks around The airport has not changed one bit except
for the fact that this time no one is here to greet him

AT HIS FATHER’S HOUSE --

John gets out of the cab with his duffel bag walks up the
driveway He tries the front door It’s locked

Annoyed he fishes under the pot of a nearby fern Pulls out
the spare key Opens the door Walks --

INTO THE HOUSE --

-- and can immediately tell something is not right There are
dirty dishes stacked in the sink Flies buzz around them
His father has never left a dish dirty anywhere in his life

Then what John sees in the living room makes him drop his bag

JOHN
Dad

Mr Tyree lies on the couch pale and weak His eyes are
glazed and his shirt is soaking wet from sweat

He tries to stand but it’s such an incredible amount of labor
that he goes entirely white His whole body shakes intensely

John grabs him afraid that he’1ll fall over and lowers him
back on the couch Then quickly he reaches for the phone

IN A HOSPITAL ROOM -- LATE THAT NIGHT

Mr Tyree lays in bed asleep tubes coming out of him from
every angle If he looked older before he looks downright
ancient now

John does not touch him Instead he just stands there
silently watching his father breathe through a tube

OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY --

John speaks quietly with a DOCTOR

JOHN
How long do you think he coulda been
like that though Cause I was
calling him once a week before I went
on assignment and things were fine

DOCTOR
How many weeks since you last spoke

John looks away Guilt flashes on his face He speaks quietly

JOHN
Three maybe

The Doctor sees the pain in him and takes pity

DOCTOR
It’s hard to say how long it’s been
really I’ve treated patients who’ve
had mild strokes without realizing
it but a stroke that significant
it’s mind boggling that he didn’t
hospitalize himself right away

John lets that sink in Then he turns starts to pace
JOHN
Okay So how long till he’s back

to normal this time

The Doctor doesn’t respond John looks at him stops in his
track quickly turns white Understands what that means

JOHN
Ifif I’d come home earlier if
Id found him like that earlier
would it have made a difference
The Doctor looks at John his face creased with sympathy

DOCTOR
I doubt it

No matter how convincing he sounds it does not appear to do
John much good

BACK AT THE HOUSE --

John walks inside Sets the spare key down on the counter

Then he takes one look around at the darkened silent messy
house around him and it’s one look too many

He grabs the key off the counter and walks right back out

AT THE SHRIMP SHACK --

The place is practically empty at this late hour John sits at
the bar alone peeling shrimp but not eating them

Reveal that the table he sat at with Savannah on their first
date is right behind him John steals a glance back at it

IN HIS CAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT
John stares at a HOUSE in the middle of a quiet neighborhood

Through the big bay windows in front John sees a FAMILY
watching TV together Two BOYS rough house on the floor

INSIDE THE HOUSE --

The MOTHER gets up goes into her big chef’s kitchen to check
on a pie

She pulls it from the oven puts it on the windowsill to
cool glances out the window

John’s car is there in plain sight but she looks past him
out at her partially obstructed view of the ocean

Although she doesn’t know it here right where she is
standing is the exact spot John first kissed Savannah

BACK IN THE CAR --
John’s seen enough He puts the car into gear and pulls away

AT HIS FATHER’S HOUSE -- LATE AT NIGHT NOW

John walks back in sets his keys back down Gets his bearings
Then heads through the house back to his bedroom

But he pauses in front of his father’s office Then despite
himself he enters flips on the light Looks around the room

Here are his father’s coins stacked all over the furniture
Here is his father’s desk and his father’s chair

John takes a seat Looks down at the desk Starts to open
drawers Look through cabinets

He finally finds what he was looking for a clean sheet of
paper He clears some room on the desk lays the sheet of
paper down in front of him

Then John grabs a pen and he begins to write

BACK AT THE HOSPITAL -- THE NEXT DAY

John walks into his father’s room Mr Tyree is now awake and
at least partially lucid His eyes flash with recognition
when he sees John

JOHN
Hey Dad

Although Mr Tyree is very weak he reaches up and tries to
pull the oxygen mask off his face yank the tube out of his
mouth He’s trying to say something

John gently grabs his hand pulls it away

JOHN
It’s okay Dad It’s fine

John guides his hands back down by his side Mr Tyree makes
a NOISE but it’s indistinguishable John grins at him

JOHN
So now you wanna talk huh

John takes a seat in the chair next to the bed lets the
familiar silence hang in the room

Then John pulls out an envelope from his back pocket He
holds it out to his Dad

Mr Tyree takes it looks back at John -- asks “what’s this”
with his eyes

JOHN
It’s nothing Just a letter I wrote

Mr Tyree tries to open it His hands are shaking heavily

JOHN
No don’t read it now Read it
when I’m not around okay

Mr Tyree stops His hands still shake but he follows John’s
instructions tries to put the letter on a nearby table It’s
not far away at all but he has a hard time reaching it

John watches him Sees how hard even that is for him
JOHN
You know what To hell with it --

here just

He takes the letter back opens it himself But he doesn’t
start reading yet -- there’s something he wants to say first

JOHN
Listen I know that I know I
haven’t been around very much the
last couple of years and

He stops This speaking from the heart thing isn’t working

So he looks down at the letter unfolds the sheet of paper
It’s only one page And then he starts to read

JOHN
Okay Dear Dad Theres something
I’ve been wanting to tell you

He glances up -- Mr Tyree is listening carefully

JOHN
Remember a few years ago back when
I got shot Well you wanna know the
very first thing that entered my
mind at that moment right before I
blacked out Coins

John looks up again sees Mr Tyree’s eyes GLINT with pride

JOHN

Suddenly I was eight years old
again on a tour of the US Mint
listening to the guide explain how
coins are made How they are
punched out of sheet metal How
they are rimmed and beveled How
they are stamped and cleaned And
then how each and every coin is
personally examined just in case
one has slipped through with the
slightest imperfection

(off Mr Tyree’s look)
Remember that Dad You remember
that trip to Philadelphia we took

Mr Tyree nods John has to turn away or else he’s gonna
start crying He focuses back on the letter

JOHN
Well thats what popped into my
head I am a coin in the United
States Army I was minted in the
year 1980 I have been punched
from sheet metal I have been
stamped and cleaned my edges have
been rimmed and beveled

Now John can’t help it Tears drip out of his eyes even
though he fights hard against them

JOHN
But now I have two small holes in
me so I am no longer in perfect
condition

He reflexively rubs his shoulder right where he was shot and
looks down at his invalid father trapped in a hospital bed

JOHN
How about it Dad We’re just a
couple of culls huh

He starts crying harder now Focuses down at the letter

JOHN
But there’s one more thing I want
to tell you too

Now he’s all starts and stops -- he’s too emotional to read
any more although he tries to push through as best he can

JOHN
After I got shot right before I
blacked out you wanna know the
very last thing that I’m sorry
just the very last thing that
that entered my mind

But he’s sobbing now unable to get it under control And he
just can’t get the last word out No matter how hard he tries
He sits in his chair unable to speak unable to finish

Then Mr Tyree reaches his hand out Puts it on top of
John’s It is remarkably steady

They look each other in the eye And through the tears John
can see -- his Dad understands

AT THE BEACH --

It’s getting dark and a storm is coming One or two
adventurous SURFERS still remain but most everybody else is
giving up and heading in

Except for John John is heading out The waves are huge
right now but he doesn’t appear interested in catching
anything Instead he barrels straight into the waves takes
the brunt of their force

A big wave hits him nearly knocks him off his board John
forces his way through it Then another wave appears-- an
enormous one the kind you brag about for weeks afterwards

The other few surfers turn paddle furiously to catch it But
John does not John paddles straight into it

The waves SMASHES into him so hard his surfboard is ripped
right off his leg strap John goes under lost in the current
and a sea of whitewater

Finally John regains his bearings finds his footing But he
stays below water no rush to pop back up

UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE -- his body shakes his tears getting
lost in the water around him

CUT TO
CLOSE ON JOHN --

-- Dry in his dress uniform It’s not quite clear where he
is yet but wherever it is he sits rigid and straight His
jaw is set His eyes are focused in front of him

SLOWLY PULL BACK --

To reveal we’re in a church And other than John the church
is completely empty

And in the front of a church is a casket

A PASTOR walks in from behind the pulpit John notices him
check his watch beneath his robe

PASTOR

I’m sorry You’re welcome to stay as
long as you’d like of course it’s
just that they were hoping to lock
the outside doors and

(then delicately)
You’re not still expecting
anyone else are you

John doesn’t respond In his silence it’s clear he was at
least hoping for someone else Anyone else Or perhaps
someone else specifically

And then just like that without a word he makes up his
mind He stands up Turns And begins to walk out

PASTOR
Where are you going

JOHN
Somewhere I should’ve gone four
years ago

OUT ON THE HIGHWAY --

John drives his father’s old Lincoln Continental which is
even older now But yet he pushes 80 miles per hour
unconcerned with anything except where he’s going

John stares out on the road his focus unwavering

A STABLE OF HORSES --

Six or seven of them in all In the very far stable a HAND
taps the kneecap of a horse causing the leg to rise

A SCALPEL like instrument is stuck into the cracks of the
horseshoe cleaning out the caked dirt and finally a
particularly painful looking pointy acorn

SAVANNAH
There we go Feel better now

The horse WHINNIES her approval Savannah smiles up at her
She stands finishes cleaning out the feeding trough She
wears work boots and her hair is cut short She’s still

pretty but she’s aged four years and it shows

She pets the horse goodbye then walks out checking on each
of the other horses as she passes by

Then as she exits the stable she finally looks up -- and what
she sees makes her GASP

There standing next to a tree up on the hill where the end
of the driveway meets the road -- is John still in uniform

He walks towards her Savannah tries her best to recover
SAVANNAH
Wow Just like that huh After

all these years

John just shrugs Savannah stares at him there in front of
her four years older than she last saw him

SAVANNAH
What are you doing here John

John thinksthen chuckles humorlessly to himself Remembers
having this conversation five years ago up at Chapel Hill

JOHN
I guess my Dad kinda sent me again

Savannah clearly remembers the conversation as well

SAVANNAH
Yeah How’s he doing

John glances away It’s quick just a split-second look but
Savannah immediately realizes what it means

SAVANNAH
No -- oh John I’m so sorry I
I wish I’d known

JOHN
Wouldn’t have changed anything

SAVANNAH
No I don’t suppose it would’ve

They’re only a few feet apart now but Savannah doesn’t move

SAVANNAH
Howd he die

This time John looks away for a much longer amount of time

JOHN
Alone

Savannah can see the pain creep onto his face

JOHN
He never had a bad word to say about
anybody He treated everybody with
respect everybody with decency And
none of that mattered one goddamn
bit because you wanna know how many
people came to his funeral

He doesn’t need to answer the question Savannahs face
creases with sympathy

SAVANNAH
He wasn’t alone John He had you

John doesn’t respond Instead he searches for something else
to talk about He glances at the stable behind her remembers
the last time they were in a stable like that together

Then he looks up Above the barn door is a sign that reads
CAMP HORSE SENSE John smiles Remembers her letter

JOHN

So You finally did it
SAVANNAH

No I didn’t But I tried

(off his look)
It only lasted one summer We
raised a lot of money but it was
just so expensive

Savannah turns stares sadly back at the stable

SAVANNAH
Life is expensive Isn’t it You
just don’t think about that stuff
when you’re in college You have
these dreams Every sentence
starts with ‘when’ But that’s not
real life is it

JOHN
Sentences in real life start with
‘why’

Savannah looks at him again Sees the pain there

SAVANNAH
I am sorry John It might not be
worth much but I am sorry He was
a good man

JOHN
I know

They eye each other She smiles nods to the main house

SAVANNAH
You wanna come inside

John turns takes in the house It’s large but dilapidated --
it could use a new paint job and the yard needs to be mowed
John hesitates

JOHN
I’m not sure Is

SAVANNAH
(quickly)
No He isn’t home

Off John’s face reacting without moving a muscle --
IN HER KITCHEN --
Savannah sets two cups of coffee down takes a seat

SAVANNAH
So how’d you find me

JOHN
Stopped by your parents’ house
Had to arm wrestle your Dad for the
address

SAVANNAH
(rolling her eyes)
Guess we know how that turned out

JOHN
He claimed he lost on purpose since
he always liked me and all but

He shrugs They accidentally make eye contact then both
quickly look away Savannah thinks of something else to say
She nods at his dress uniform

SAVANNAH
I guess youre still

(in the Army) John nods

SAVANNAH
How long you back for

JOHN
Just till I get his things squared
away

Savannah nods -- that’s what she was expecting She takes a
sip of coffee Her WEDDING RING gleams in the sun John
stares at it clears his throat

JOHN
How’s married life

SAVANNAH
Can’t complain How about you
Settled down yet

John just shakes his head

SAVANNAH
Must be dating lots of girls huh

John doesn’t answer just patiently holds eye contact until
Savannah becomes uncomfortable and has to look away

Finally the phone RINGS bailing her out She excuses
herself goes to answer it

SAVANNAH
Hello Hi honey I’m fine No
nothing’s wrong Why do you think--
oh be quiet I do not sound strange

She looks over at John Bites her lip
SAVANNAH
WellI’m sitting across the table
from John actually Yes John
Tyree Um I’m not sure he’ll

Savannah pauses listens to the voice on the other end

SAVANNAH
Okay I’‘ll tell him No no I’m
still coming I’m just about to
leave I’11 be there soon
(off his response)
I love you too

She hangs up the phone Turns back to John

SAVANNAH
He wants to see you

JOHN
Are you serious
(off Savannah’s nod)
What’s he expecting a hug Has he
forgotten what I did to him at the
beach

SAVANNAH
No He hasn’t forgotten

John finishes his coffee Then he abruptly stands

JOHN
Thank you For the coffee

He turns to leave Stops Looks back at her

JOHN
Sorry But I didn’t come out here
(he trails off)
Well I’m not sure why I came out
here But it wasn’t to shake Randy’s
hand and tell him it’s all water
under the bridge okay

Savannah stares at him oddly Then she gets up walks past
him into the living room

SAVANNAH
John I didn’t marry Randy

John’s confused But then he follows her gaze to a picture
perched on the mantle over the fireplace

John walks over Picks the picture up Stares at it
It’s a WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH OF SAVANNAH AND TIM
John can hardly believe his eyes Savannah stands over his

shoulder watches him look at this picture of her ina
flowing white wedding gown

SAVANNAH
I’m gonna go see him now bring him
an afternoon coffee It would mean a
lot to him -- to both of us -- if
you came along

John puts the picture back on the mantle He looks over at
her genuinely torn

BUT IN HER CAR --

Savannah drives in silence John in the passenger seat They
get on the highway

JOHN
How far away does he work

Savannah keeps her eyes focused on the road

SAVANNAH
We’re not going to his work

John glances over at her But Savannah’s not gonna elaborate
LATER --

Still silent John looks over at Savannah who’s still
staring straight ahead

Then she puts on her blinker turns into a parking lot She
pulls into a space checks her makeup in the rearview mirror
John looks up at the building in front of him It is the
GASTONIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

JOHN
Savannah What’s going on

She shrugs without looking at him busying herself with her
makeup trying hard to be as nonchalant as possible

SAVANNAH
It started as melanoma Skin cancer
just a little spot on his leg He
had it removed It went into
remission Then it came back Now
it’s spread into his lungs

Without another word she gets out of the car Reluctantly
so does John

GASTONIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL -- OUTSIDE ROOM 131

Savannah motions to John -- after you John walks into the
room There’s a 14 YEAR OLD BOY sitting in the chair beneath
the TV and he glances up as they enter

14 YEAR OLD BOY
Hello John

John does a double take

JOHN
Alan

But Alan’s already focused back on the NINTENDO DS in his
hands John can hardly believe it’s him

JOHN
Wow You’ve gotten big

TIM
Yeah they grow up fast don’t they

John turns to find TIM sitting up in the hospital bed He
looks much older -- his skin is pale almost translucent and
he’s lost a lot of weight

Savannah kisses him hello hands him a thermos of coffee They
make some small talk then she turns to Alan in the chair

SAVANNAH
Alan Let’s go get a soda okay

Alan dutifully follows Savannah out She glances back into
the room before she goes but she doesn’t say a word
Now John and Tim are suddenly left all alone

TIM
Guess you must want to kick my ass
huh
John shrugs
JOHN

Not much I can do about that in
here is there

Tim grins back at him

TIM
All part of my master plan

JOHN
Yeah
(as he surveys the room)
Helluva plan

TIM
Thanks

JOHN
I can’t stay long I’ve really I’ve
got somewhere I need to be--

TIM

It’s okay I understand You want
some jello It’s lime today The menu
said cherry but that’s what they do
they keep you on your toes here

JOHN
I’1l pass

TIM
I love her Just so you know

John glances at him surprised by the sudden shift in topics

TIM
I’ve loved her for as long as I can
remember Whatever my life was like
before I fell in love with her it’s
gone now wiped away I want you to
know that It probably doesn’t
matter to you but it matters to me

John doesn’t respond

TIM
I am sorry though For how it
happened with you so far away I
am sorry for what I did--

JOHN
Tim

TIM

No Let me finish I’m sorry for
what I did But I wouldn’t undo
it Because now if

(he trails off)
well now I know Alan will
always have somebody to take care
of him no matter what Now I know
he’1ll always be in good hands And
as much as I like you John I’m
his father so he’s the most
important thing in the world to me

(then directly to John)
And I think that’s something you
especially can understand

John looks away Tim continues to watch him carefully

Then he starts to COUGH It comes on normally maybe a little
raspy at first but turns into a full-on COUGHING FIT

John watches on hopelessly as Tim seems to cough up a lung
John has no idea what he’s supposed to do -- is he supposed
to call a nurse Supposed to help him somehow

And then just as quickly as it started it stops again Tim
lies in bed sweating like crazy waving John off

TIM
I’m fine I’m fine I am Didnt
need that lung anyway no big deal
She still loves you you know

Once again John’s taken by surprise

TIM
Trust me it’s plain as day She’s
never quite looked at me the way
she used to look at you I wish
that wasn’t the case but I’ve had
plenty of time to make my peace
with it believe me

John stands uncomfortably by the side of the bed

TIM
I’m glad you came though John I
am Because the question now is
who’s gonna take care of her no
matter what She’s young She’s
beautiful--

JOHN
Tim

TIM
What I can’t be realistic She’1l
meet somebody else Eventually
She’1l have to

Then Tim looks John directly in the eyes

TIM
And I don’t have any control over
it obviously I just wish I had
the chance to look whoever it’1ll be
in the eyes and tell him to take
care of her To treat her right To
love her as much as I do

Just then a nurse interrupts bringing Tim nightly cocktails

of drugs

It’s an obscene amount of pills Tim grins

TIM
Alright My hors d’ouvres

The nurse smiles -- obviously she likes him She hands over
the pills lets him start on them while she preps his arm for
a shot pulls out an enormous 14 gauge needle

John backs away trying to give Tim his privacy

JOHN
I should go Tim But good luck

Tim looks over at John as the giant needle enters his arm
TIM
Thanks I won’t lie I could probably
use a little luck right now

Then as he bites down on his lip CRINGING from the pain

BACK OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL --

John walks out Finds Savannah sitting on the steps puffing
on a cigarette He can’t believe what he’s seeing

JOHN
What you smoke now

She stands up Puts the pack back in her purse

SAVANNAH
Just one or two when I’m stressed

John stares at her Sees how much she’s changed

JOHN
Am I stressing you out

She SHRUGS Exhales a puff of smoke

SAVANNAH
Get in line

Then she calls over to Alan who’s lying nearby in the grass

SAVANNAH
Alan let’s go say goodbye to Dad

Savannah looks back at John as she leads Alan inside

SAVANNAH
Give us a minute

John nods Watches them disappear through the doors

IN SAVANNAH’S CAR -- LATER

Savannah drives John sits quietly in the front seat next to
her Alan’s in the back his nose in his videogame as usual

They come to a stop at a red light and pull up next to a van
Inside is an adult DRIVER and a bunch of KIDS It’s a church
group or a school trip or a children’s home -- or something
One LITTLE GIRL looks out the van’s window longingly back
into Savannah’s car She and John make eye contact and John
can tell what she sees

She sees what looks like a family

BACK AT THE HOUSE IN LENOIR --

Savannah turns the car onto the dirt driveway As soon as
she pulls up to the house Alan bolts out heading straight
for the stables Savannah calls after him

SAVANNAH
Dinner in ten minutes

Alan waves as he disappears inside the stable Savannah
stares after him for a beat then turns to John

SAVANNAH
You hungry

IN THE KITCHEN -- LATER

John Savannah and Alan finish off plates of beef stroganoff
and potatoes au gratin John’s impressed

JOHN
I didn’t know you were such a good
cook

SAVANNAH
I’m not My mom is She makes it
wraps it up sends it over All I
do is heat it up

Alan finishes first slams his fork down like it’s a race

ALAN
Can I be excused

Before Savannah can even finish nodding Alan’s out the door
back to the stables John watches him through the window

JOHN
He still loves those horses huh

SAVANNAH
Oh he’ll be out there till bedtime
No point convincing him otherwise

John turns around to find Savannah opening a bottle of red
wine pouring out a glass for each of them

JOHN
You drink now too

SAVANNAH
Just a glass of wine or two after
dinner Tim got me started

She hands him his glass John watches her take a long sip

JOHN
Is he gonna make it

Savannah sits down at the table Looks more tired than ever

SAVANNAH
Not with the treatment he’s getting
now He needs to get out of here
Out of that hospital All they can
do there is interferon and it’s not
working MD Anderson starts testing
a new vaccine in June -- not for
prevention like most vaccines but
for treatment It’s his best
chance but the health care company
wont pay for it those--

She stops herself Takes a deep calming breath

SAVANNAH
It’s an experimental treatment the
vaccine and no health care company
in the world pays for experimental
treatments

JOHN
And going ahead without coverage
isn’t an option

She laughs out loud despite herself

SAVANNAH
Like I said -- life’s expensive My
parents sold the beach house a year
ago to help with the medical costs
It’s only gotten worse since then

She finishes her glass (John’s barely started his) pours
herself another

SAVANNAH
They took a second mortgage on their
main house We took a second on
ours But we’ve already gone through
most all of it We opened up a
charitable foundation for donations
well do some fundraisers but

She trails off Stands up Goes over to the window stares

out at the stable and the night sky

SAVANNAH

He got the diagnosis eight months
after I saw you last Eight months
after that night at my parents

She doesn’t look over at John Keeps staring out the window

SAVANNAH
At first I just wanted to help I
started coming by as much as I could
to give him a hand with Alan To
give him a shoulder to cry on

John stands in the kitchen silently Doesn’t interrupt
Lets her say whatever she needs to say

SAVANNAH
We didn’t plan it I don’t even
know how it happened really

She starts to become emotional Tries to push through it

SAVANNAH
I kept writing you letters though
Every seven days I felt terrible
about it but I couldn’t stop I
couldn’t stop writing to you I
couldn’t stop trying to tell you

She turns away from him John doesn’t move

JOHN
I tried to write back you know
While I was holed up in the hospital
after I got shot I started to write
you a bunch of times Never sent any
of them though Never even finished
them

Savannah turns back around Finally looks at him

SAVANNAH
You were shot

John nods Savannah’s face is pained

SAVANNAH
Where

John pauses Then he stands up slowly removes his coat and
tie Unbuttons his shirt

Maintains eye contact with her the whole time while he pulls
the shirt off Underneath is an army issue wife beater

His shoulder wound is visible round and only a quarter of an
inch wide Hard to believe it’s so small Savannah touches
it lightly -- the tip of her thumb completely covers it up

She steps around him looks for the exit wound She GASPS
when she sees it -- it’s huge and scar tissue covers the
entire back of his shoulder She brushes it with her hand

Then she steps back in front of John Slowly he lifts his
shirt up She finds another small rounded scar above his
abdomen She brushes her finger over this one too

When she finally looks up at him tears are streaming down
her face She touches his left eyebrow just like she did
back at that half-built house in Wilmington seven years ago

SAVANNAH
So many scars

She starts to cry harder now John lets her

SAVANNAH
I’m sorry John

John still doesn’t respond Knows she’s not apologizing for
these scars but for the other ones

SAVANNAH
Why do these things happen to us
Huh What’d we do to deserve all
this Is it karma Is that it

She pauses trying to regain her composure

SAVANNAH
It’s like those two weeks we spent
together were too perfect you know
It wasn’t fair for us to have a few
weeks like that in a world like
this and so we have to pay them
back for it I think we’ve been
paying them back for it ever since

John looks away Savannah wipes her eyes pours them each a

new glass tosses away the bottle
SAVANNAH
C’mon There’s something I want to
show you

IN THE LIVING ROOM --

John sits on the couch with his glass of wine Savannah
comes into the room with a thick folder sits next to him

SAVANNAH
I saved every single one of them

John opens the folder Flips through all the letters he ever
wrote her The memories flood back

The very last letter is on the back of an old phone bill He
flips it over-- it’s just four words I LOVE YOU JOHN

SAVANNAH
Even your first

John looks over at her They are suddenly very close

Savannah does not take her eyes off of him Their faces are
just inches apart They are having a moment

Then Savannah accidently knocks her wine glass over She
rescues the folder of letters but her blouse and John’s
undershirt are doused

SAVANNAH
Shoot I’m sorry

JOHN
Don’t worry about it it’s a two
dollar undershirt
She looks down at her own blouse which is much worse off
SAVANNAH
This is one of my favorites

though I should get it soaking

She heads down the hall turns into one of the BEDROOMS
John stands too heads into the HALLWAY BATHROOM --

-- turns on the faucet starts spot rinsing his shirt
BUT IN THE MIRROR’S REFLECTION --

-- he can see Savannah through the cracked door of the bedroom
across the hall She’s topless with her back to him

Although he tries he cannot turn away Savannah senses him
staring looks over her shoulder Caught John waits for her
to cover herself and close the door But she does neither

Instead she catches his eye and holds it willing him to
continue watching her And then slowly she turns around

They stand there facing each other through the reflection
with only the narrow hallway separating them Neither one of
them moves Neither one of their gazes waver

Suddenly the front door CRASHES OPEN and shatters the quiet

ALAN
Ten o’clock Bedtime

Savannah turns grabs a shirt to pull on John walks out of
the bathroom just in time to see Alan hurry up the stairs

JOHN
Goodnight Alan

But he doesn’t respond Savannah comes out into the hallway
fully dressed now and calls up after him

SAVANNAH
Take a bath and brush your teeth
okay I’1l be up in fifteen
minutes to tuck you in

ALAN’S VOICE
Twelve minutes Gotta be in bed in
twelve minutes

SAVANNAH
So I’1ll be up in twelve minutes then

Savannah grins over at John Looks at him hopefully
SAVANNAH
Only twelve minutes If you wanna

stay I could make coffee or

John sighs Knows what’s left unsaid when she trails off
He looks back at her and then he makes his mind up

He turns walks back into the kitchen Savannah follows him
watches him grab his shirt and coat She’s stunned

SAVANNAH
You’re leaving

John looks back at her sadly Apologetically

JOHN
Im sorry

Savannah’s eyes start to well up but she fights the tears
back John watches her chooses his words carefully

JOHN
The thing is -- I think I was always
so busy feeling bad for myself I
never realized how tough it must
have been for you How tough that
decision must’ve been to make

He finishes getting dressed walks towards her
JOHN
But you made it You made a decision
because you had to And I respect
that I have to respect that

Savannah starts to tremble

SAVANNAH
John I I’m so --
JOHN
(interrupting)

Its okay Youve said Im sorry
enough Its my turn now

She reaches out wraps her arms around him holds on tightly
Knows he’s leaving and there’s nothing she can do about it

SAVANNAH
We’1ll see each other again though
Right I’1l see you soon then

John doesn’t answer He pulls himself away heads to the door

JOHN
Goodbye Savannah

SAVANNAH
No No you’re supposed to say
“Tll see you soon then” Remember
When I ask “Ill see you soon
then” You’re supposed to

She trails off John turns to her She’s crying softly now
desperate and indignant and pleading --

SAVANNAH
John You’re supposed to say it
You’re supposed to say “I’1l see
you soon then”

John looks back at her Takes her in one final time This
might be the hardest thing he’s ever had to do

Then without another word he walks out

Savannah goes to the window watches as he gets into his car
turns it on and heads up the driveway

Only when he finally disappears from view does she finally
start to sob

IN A MOSTLY EMPTY COIN SHOP -- THE FOLLOWING DAY

The front door CHIMES and the DEALER looks up (his is a face
we’ve seen before) John nods hello

JOHN
Hi You probably don’t remember me
but you know my father-- Bill Tyree

COIN DEALER
Course I do Haven’t seen him in a
while how is he

John doesn’t answer at first He just takes in the store
remembers the first time he stepped foot in here almost
twenty years ago now

JOHN
You offered to buy his whole
collection once Didn’t you

COIN DEALER
Sure did More than once

John walks through the display cases eyeballs the rows and
rows of coins laid out under the glass

JOHN
Just out of curiosity how much do
you think it’s worth All his stuff

COIN DEALER
A collection big as your Dad’s

He WHISTLES lets him know -- serious money John nods
finally looks the Dealer in the eye

JOHN
Think you could lend me a hand

QUTSIDE --

John POPS his trunk

JOHN
There’s only one condition-- the
mules stay together Offer them as
a set Keep them yourself But
they stay together okay

The Dealer eyes the boxes and boxes jammed into the trunk
Sees that even more boxes are stacked in the backseat Turns
to John in disbelief
COIN DEALER
Youre really gonna sell me all
your Daddy’s coins

John looks over at him

JOHN
All but one

SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST -- MONTHS LATER

John stands in the middle of the desert Takes in the view

IN HIS HAND -- he flips a GLASS-ENCASED COIN through his
fingers A very familiar glass-encased coin

Around him his TEAM (many of whom are new faces) argue where
base camp should be set up John SHUSHES them all

JOHN
Guys This comes up nickel side we
set up here where we’ve got shade
Comes up penny side we set up on the
ridge where we have visibility

John FLIPS the coin high up in the air lets it fall into the
sand One of the others goes to check out the result

GREEN BERET
It’s tails
(beat)
So what does that mean

John takes the coin back He carefully wipes a smudge from
the glass then tucks it safely into his pocket

JOHN
It means we’re gonna need sunscreen

Some of the soldiers GROAN -- but they all get to work As
John helps to coordinate the move a YOUNG BERET walks up
with a delivery

YOUNG BERET
Sargeant Major

JOHN
No ranks in the field son

He looks down at the delivery in the kid’s hand -- it’s a
LETTER The handwriting is familiar So is the clean white
envelope He instantly knows what it is

John takes the letter finds himself a secluded spot
carefully opens it up

And then he begins to read

SAVANNAH’ S VOICE
Dear John

Drift away from John alone in this sea of sand

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Its been almost five years since I
wrote a letter with an actual pen
on an actual sheet of notebook
paper I don’t think I realized
until today how much Ive missed it

BACK AT THE HOUSE IN LENOIR --

Savannah watches Alan sit at the kitchen table carefully
penciling in words on a large banner

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
Though I suppose its not really
writing letters that I miss Its
writing letters to you

She hands Alan a magic marker Watches as he starts back at
the beginning tracing his pencil lines with the marker
Watches the ink seep into the paper

SAVANNAH
So I thought maybe I could write to
you now and let you know all that’s
happened since I saw you last

IN HER BEDROOM --

Savannah sits in a private corner all alone and puts her
own pen to paper again

SAVANNAHS VOICE
A few weeks after you showed up in
Lenoir an anonymous donation was
made to Tims foundation a donation
big enough for us to buy him a spot
in the experimental vaccination
program at MD Anderson

IN THE OUTPATIENT WING OF A STRANGE HOSPITAL --

Tim sits in bed much of the color back in his face He
smiles warmly at the nurse checking his blood pressure

SAVANNAH’ S VOICE
Hes back in Houston right now for
his final treatment but hes been
in remission for two months Were
not sure if it will last

ON A PATR OF AUTOMATIC DOORS --

-- as they WHISK open and Tim steps out in street clothes
SAVANNAHS VOICE
but it might and thats good
enough for us

DRIFT TOWARDS THE HOUSE IN LENOIR --

-- where cars are parked all over the yard and above the
front door hangs Alan’s banner very impressively lettered
which reads WELCOME HOME DAD

Drift through the doors to find the party already in swing

SAVANNAHS VOICE
As for the donation I cannot even
begin to imagine who out there would
do such a selfless thing as that in
such a selfish world as this

Savannah shows a healthy looking Tim through the crowd They
greet their guests here are Mr and Mrs Curtis who happily
hug their son-in-law

SAVANNAHS VOICE
And I realize of course that all
this person has asked in return
for saving my husbands life is to
remain anonymous

-here is Alan dressed up in a suit shyly trying to engage
a GAWKY GIRL in actual conversation

SAVANNAH’S VOICE
So although it is difficult I know
I must respect his wishes Which
Means all I can do is wake up every
morning and say thank you To the
sky To no one To everyone

Savannah looks at Alan her parents her healthy husband
She looks around at all of these people here to support him

Her eyes water with gratitude

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Its a small gesture but its all
that I have I hope that it is
enough

Then she excuses herself from the group walks across the
room to an empty corner

SAVANNAHS VOICE
And thats the gift this person has
given me Thats what has been
missing from my life and thats
whats been returned to me now

In this empty corner there is a window and Savannah stares
out it lost in thought

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Hope

BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARTY --

Tim looks around the crowd surrounded by all these people
who love him He knows how lucky he is

SAVANNAHS VOICE
I hope this letter finds you well
John

Then Tim suddenly realizes that something is missing He
looks around the party trying to find his wife

--but she’s nowhere to be found now
OUTSIDE --

Although the party is in full swing indoors things are much
quieter out here As the wind rustles through the trees --

SAVANNAHS VOICE
Actually I just hope this letter
finds you period

IN THE STABLES --

Alan shows off his favorite horse to the Gawky Girl While
they stand there petting her in silence drift past them

SAVANNAHS VOICE
I hope that youre safe and that
youre happy I have no idea where
you are out there in the world but
I understand that I lost the right
to know these things long ago

TOWARDS THE MAIN HOUSE --

-- where Savannah stands on the porch alone
Then she looks up into the night sky --

SAVANNAHS VOICE
I want you to know though that no
matter how much time passes no
matter how far away you are

-- where she finds the full moon above her and as she
raises her thumb to cover it up --

SAVANNAHS VOICE
-on nights like these youll
always be here with me

DRIFT AWAY FROM HER --

-- pulling back from the house heading down the driveway up
the hill towards the woods by the main road

SAVANNAHS VOICE
And more than anything else I hope
that part of me is out there with
you too
-landing by one tree in particular

SAVANNAHS VOICE
--wherever you may be

to find John standing in the shadows behind it

He watches Savannah staring up at their moon like he’d hoped
that she would and it makes him smile

Then after a long moment John turns and as he starts to
head back to his car to his house to wherever he came from--

-- he disappears back into the shadows underneath the moon
which looms large above everything

FADE TO BLACK
