EXT WHEAT FIELD - MORNING

SAMANTHA DARKO opens her eyes She squints as the

sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size She sits up slowly
looks around and finds herself in midst of an endless
wheat field

Sam is pretty and demure Her coppery hair flows past her
shoulders Disoriented she stands and gazes at the infinite
golden shimmer Amber waves of grain Patches of forest in

the distance Its quiet Serene Beautiful

She smiles and starts walking

EXT ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING

She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in
Arkansas Adjacent to her position on the other side of the
deserted lanes is a TRUCK STOP

EXT TRUCK STOP - MORNING

Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot isa
white late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY Sam makes her way
across the asphalt toward the vehicle

INT COREYS CHEVROLET - MORNING

COREY RICHARDSON is asleep curled up in the reclined
drivers seat of the car She awakens when Sam gets in on

passenger side and slams the door shut

Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen dyed hair
eyes

She

Star)

piercings a little grungy She rubs the sleep from her
greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm
finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one

COREY
What time is it

SAM
Early

Corey adjusts her seat She takes a long drag and chokes
then spits out the window She starts the car

IE COREYS CHEVROLETHIGHWAY 40 VARIOUS - DAY

Coreys car cruises along the flat open road She cranks up
the VOLUME on the cars CASSETTE DECK nodding her head to
early-90s ALT ROCK (suggestion Into Dust by Mazzy

Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery FARMERS at
work in the fields a BILLBOARD advertising a local
restaurant ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash

She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane It
contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY MOTHER FATHER and
three SIBLINGS one of them being a YOUNGSTER The Youngster
makes a face at Sam as they pass by

INT COREYS CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY
Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine
start to RATTLE She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit
the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on
COREY

Shit
EXT OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40COREYS CHEVROLET - DAY
By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway

steam billows out from under the hood Sam gets out of the
car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel
Sam peeks under the hood trying to clear the air of the
steam It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the
inside of the engine with a hammer

SAM
Turn it off

COREY
(poking her head out the
WINDOW)
What

SAM
Turn off the car

Corey does so

SAM (CONTD)
Doesnt look too good

COREY
How do you know

SAM
It smells funny

Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward
them Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down

The pick-up pulls over ahead of them CHRIS HOLT a
brawny attractive young man gets out When Corey sees him
she gets out too

SAM (CONTD)
Thanks for stopping Our cars

CHRIS
What happened

COREY
My check engine light came on then
it just started smoking and
ticking and shit

As Chris pokes around under the hood Sam and Corey exchange
looks Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand

on

CHRIS
(shaking it off)
Blew your water pump Cant drive

IE CHRIS TRUCKEL RENO VARIOUS - DAY

All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up they drive
through the center of El Reno Oklahoma (population 16000)
and see some of the locals out and about MUSIC MONTAGE
fueled by early- to mid-90s era GRUNGE ROCK (suggestion

As You Are by Nirvana) -- reminiscent of the “Middlesex
Middle School Montage in DONNIE DARKO

AGATHA DOWDY an employee of the local DINER sits ona

OFFICER RYAN ODELL has pulled over a PRETTY LADY and
uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate

They come up on VIETNAM TOM who ambles along the side
of the road against traffic and he waves to them as they
pass He wears old weather beaten clothes and a multi-
colored SKI MASK over his head and face

END MONTAGE

Sam swivels her head to watch Tom ANOTHER CAR passes and he
older

waves to it as well Chris picks up on her curiosity

CHRIS
He waves to everybody Just kinda
walks up and down

COREY
Resident nutcase

CHRIS
People call him Vietnam Tom

SAM
He was in the war

CHRIS
He thinks he was kind of a joke
ya know

Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight
PAN DOWN to a PUDDLE by the side of the road As a CAR TIRE
splashes through it PAN UP TO FIND

IE DUSTYS GARAGEHOUSE - AFTERNOON

Dustys auto repair shop which is nothing more than a big
garage attached to his old two-story house Coreys car has
been towed there and DUSTY GIBBENS (37 father of Ruth

Gibbens) the lone mechanic tinkers around under the hood

Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting
bored as hell A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged
into a crack in the walkway The girls are forced to get up
when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door

RUTH
Can I get out

Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house Ruths
look is hardened rough around the edges -- she appears

than her 18 years

The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father
She whispers something in his ear and Dusty hands her some
CASH which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek After
this Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes
outside to address Corey and Sam
DUSTY
Yeah its the water pump

COREY
So what do we do

DUSTY

motel looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen Kings
GERALDS GAME when the girls enter They each have a SMALL
SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow

PHIL

street from the motel Ruth Randy Evans and Jeff and Mike

Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar
fashion

to how they were earlier in the day

RUTH

acquaintance He wastes no time in introducing himself

RANDY

strangers Sam hangs back a little

COREY

COREY

Corey looks to Sam who produces some cash Randy takes the
money and heads for the store

RANDY
Be right back

After hes gone theres an uncomfortable moment of silence
in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously Ruth
stares at them in a different way She seems somewhat
resentful of their presence

RUTH
From Virginia huh

COREY
Yep

RUTH

Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment Another
beat of uncomfortable silence

RUTH (CONTD)

COREY

EXT BANK - LATER - NIGHT
The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 330 AM -- then flashes to

JUNE 19 1995 It changes again this time to a countdown
to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION 15 DAYS 17 HOURS 29
MINUTES 57 SECONDS 56 SECONDS 55 SECONDS

INT MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT

Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare She lies atop the
blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS She looks over
and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed

TWO PLASTIC CUPS EMPTY SODA CANS and the BOTTLE are on the
nightstand between them the liquor partially consumed
Theres a digital CLOCKRADIO that reads 330 AM

The TV is on and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE
FOREMAN GRILL plays Sam stares at the screen as the images
WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly
loud rumbling TREMOR from outside

na daze she gets up and slowly walks closer to the
television She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND about to
touch it A strange abrupt HARD CUT TO
and

which

She

sees

EXT GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT
Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel moving away from

the building She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT JEANS and her
RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE

Theres a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple
with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded
under the skin and protruding from the wound

She is without expression and her movements are rhythmic

fluid A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance

SAMS LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD

A glimpse of the field through Sams eyes shows a
phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in

objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions
and move according to a framework of set paths

A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic
life-gel to its burrow COSMIC ENERGY burns around a
CLUSTER OF STONES Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF
INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sams
field of vision

Its infinitely complex but Sam sees through it clearly
has no vector spear of her own to guide her but she is
cognizant of her path She moves toward the WINDMILL
EXT WINDMILL - NIGHT

Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower A giant WATER
TANK squats beside it Remaining stoic she looks up and

Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform more than 30

feet up staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
his ski mask

ANGLE WINDMILL PLATFORM
of

Tom peers over the edge of the small platform the surface

which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING a WATER BOTTLE
CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP He cradles a RIFLE in his
arms

His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to
what is sitting right beside him --

REVEAL Sam Her legs dangle over the side of the platform
and she stares off into distance

SAM
The skys so beautiful here

Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at
her Sam turns to meet his gaze

SAM (CONTD)
But we cant stay

SAMS LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM

Sam sees through to the core of his physical being the
DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent
circle around his chest

Magnified NEURONS in TOMS BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
release NEUROTRANSMITTERS which excite OTHER NEURONS

Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam but an invisible FORCE
FIELD makes contact impossible RIPPLES swell throughout the
clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it and his
hand remains glued to the spot

Sam extends her bandaged right hand and presses it to
Vietnam Toms as if she were touching a mirrored image of
herself

The contact generates more RIPPLES and as TREMORS begin to
shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the
COSMOS

DISTORTED VOICE (VO)
15 days 18 hours 45
minutes 6 seconds That is when
swirling

to

the world will end
A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them gaping and
like Gods eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado As Sam and
Tom stand in unison to peer into it a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF
WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --
EXT BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHT
They appear near the foot of the windmill sprinting away
from it together Tom has his rifle and he looks up to the
sky as he runs
theres a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening
THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --
EXT BUS STOP - MORNING
Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her She struggles
peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that

stands over her Her eyes adjust to discover that its a
policeman -- Officer ODell

OFFICER ODELL
“Fraid you cant sleep here miss

Sam sits up and realizes shes on a bench at a bus stop near
the side of the road ODells tone is innocuous and when

she looks up at him again she sees that hes grinning

OFFICER ODELL (CONTD)
Got anyplace to be

Sam manages to find her voice

SAM
The motel

She takes his hand and rises

IE ODELLS CRUISERMOTEL - MORNING

ODells cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot which is
side

from

uncharacteristically full A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the
of the road Just then a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO

DISPATCH (VO)
We got some kinda situation at
Frank Haleys farm

OFFICER ODELL
Copy that Im here now

EXT GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING

Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter with charred bits
of wood and metal strewn everywhere GROUND WATER spurts

the broken WELL SEAL

And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
crater

Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam
and ODell arrive on the scene Corey is already there
looking on as well as Chris Holt who gave them a ride into
town Phil Coulter from the motel and other local CITIZENS
FRANK HALEY the farmer who owns the land is fuming

FRANK
Un-fuckin-believable

The Firemen drop the porous misshapen clod by his feet

FIREMAN 1
Its still warm

FRANK
You know how much its gonna cost
me to replace this goddamn
windmill

Officer ODell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
with his boot

OFFICER ODELL
Sell this thing off to some
meteorologist nerd club I bet you
could do okay
FRANK
Ya think

Sam looks down at a CAN OF FOOD on the ground amidst some
scorched CLOTHING ODell takes note of some other CANNED
GOODS and SCRAPS OF TARP

OFFICER ODELL
Whats all that stuff Frank

FRANK
That whack job Toms been squattin
up there the last couple a months
Thinks hes the goddamn town
watchman
(BEAT)
You think he got blown up

Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until
Phil pipes up

PHIL
I saw him out in front of the motel
early this morning alive and well

FRANK
(SARCASTIC)
Oh well thank heavens

Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK Its marred by

BURN
MARKS and DENTS from the explosion As she tilts her head
and
looks closer she can almost pick out a shape created by the
damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin

in the form of a bizarre toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT
MONSTER BUNNY

EXT MOTEL - MORNING

Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
they turn and see that Chris has followed them

CHRIS
Hey

SAM
Hey

CHRIS
So you guys stayed here last night

COREY
One of us did

Sam gives Corey a look Chris decides to ignore the comment

CHRIS
Whats up with your car

COREY
Its gonna take a couple days

CHRIS
For a water pump

Sam and Corey shrug

CHRIS (CONTD)
None of my business but

Hes distracted when a brand new 95 BMW pulls up and parks
nearby JEREMY FRAME a thin pale young man hops out
and hustles into the field toward the crash site

SAM
What

Chris regains his train of thought
CHRIS
I was just gonna say if you
wanted I could give you a ride

He looks right at Sam when he says this He then glances

over
at Corey as if just remembering she was there
CHRIS (CONTD)
You too I mean I could give you
both a ride

COREY
To Middlesex Virginia Do you have
any clue how far that is

CHRIS
(SHEEPISH)
I got some time

Sam looks as though shes about to say something but Corey
overpowers her

COREY
Were not goin back Even El
Renos better than there

Chris makes eye contact with Sam again She maintains it for
a moment and then looks away

EXT JUNKYARD - DAY

Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard gathering
materials He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE RUSTY
MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS

He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a
collection hes making in a worn SATCHEL

EXT DINER - DAY

As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner Trudy Potter
a bank teller is on her way out

The girls move to the side so she can exit and take notice
of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY
MOORCROFTS dark empty eyes stare at them from the
BLACK and WHITE PHOTOGRAPH

TRUDY (0S)
Isnt that just awful

Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders
TRUDY (CONTD)
His poor mother
INT DINER - DAY
The girls sit at a booth sipping Cokes

COREY
How much money do we have left

SAM
Not a whole lot

COREY
I cant believe your fucking
parents wouldnt give you anything

SAM
They totally flipped out that I was
even going They werent about to

COREY
We shouldve waited till the end of
the month when my mom gets her

SAM
She wouldnt have given you
anything

COREY

Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw

COREY (CONTD)
Doesnt matter As soon as we get
to Vegas well be set My cousin
said sometimes she makes two grand
in a week

SAM

Sam is impressed but something about her subdued reaction

exhibits reservations Just then Agatha Dowdy arrives
with

plates of BURGERS AND FRIES

AGATHA

SAM

AGATHA
You hear that Ted

She calls to Ted Moncton who is busy behind the counter

TED (CONTD)

Well have yourself some ice cream
when youre done on the house

COREY SAM
Okay Thank you
AGATHA
Anything else you need give a
holler

Agatha moves off and Sam and Corey start to dig into their
food

Momentarily someone else enters and takes a seat at the
counter by their booth Its Jeremy Frame the driver of the
BMW He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence

JEREMY
Just a coffee please

Ted nods and pours him a cup After he receives his

Jeremy turns and stares at the girls They both notice him
doing it but Corey is the first to speak

COREY
Can we help you

JEREMY
No no its just that I

motel Pretty amazing huh

COREY

COREY

Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected Sam smirks and
munches on a french fry -- shes enjoying their
conversation

JEREMY (CONTD)

lab there

Corey focuses on her lunch ignoring him but Jeremy goes
on

JEREMY (CONTD)

siderite Theyre composed
primarily of iron and nickel

COREY

JEREMY

COREY

Sam glances up at Jeremy expecting him to be hurt or
embarrassed by Coreys snub But hes not Hes smiling at
his

it

from

until

her and she cant help but smile back

EXT FATHER HOMEIJERS HOUSECHURCH - AFTERNOON

Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE Corey and Sam walk past the
home of Father Homeijer The priest is outside working in

flower garden wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR An old CATHOLIC
CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house looming behind
When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by he rises

his work takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his
forehead Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them

COREY
Whats his problem

SAM
Just keep walking
Corey waves to him in a sarcastic exaggerated manner The

priest doesnt wave back but continues to gawk at them
they go around the corner

COREY
Freak

EXT JUNKYARD STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON

Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece
of CORRUGATED ROOFING He works with great focus arranging
VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE

EXT LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON

Having finished their ice creams the girls pass the liquor

EXT RANDYS HOUSE BACKYARD - NIGHT

The party at Randys teems with LOCALS ages ranging from
early teens to late-20s On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC Theres a slimy-looking POOL
and a few people swim in the greenish water

Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair They stop off so

Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS Corey and
Sam

hang with Mike and Jeff drinking beer

COREY
You guys gotta come visit the club

MIKE

COREY

SAM
Yeah Definitely

Corey is relaxed enjoying their newfound friends while Sam

appears more out of place

She drains the better part of her

cup for some liquid courage

Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
ODell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes Ruth

notices him first

RUTH
Fuck

RANDY
What

RUTH

That pig ODell

RANDY

Dont worry about Ryan He might be
a cop but he still likes to party

Randys theory is proven when ODell takes a FLASK from his
pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE

GIRLS But Ruth is still

RUTH

not satisfied

I think that asshole knows I deal
You know how fucked that is

RANDY
From what I hear

RUTH
Fucking pigs a pig

Theyre all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into
the pool and splashes them

MIKE JEFF
Fuck Bastard

SAM
What the hell

Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants Ruth
watches her smirking

RANDY
We might as well all go in now

were already wet

RUTH
Good idea

Without warning Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --

ANGLE BENEATH THE WATER
She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION All SOUNDS
DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil completely detached

Through her blurred vision Sam can see Randys PORCH LIGHTS
glimmering beyond the surface of the water TRANSITION TO

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the
STAGE Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE
can been seen

In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity YOUNG SAMANTHA
and the SPARKLE MOTION GIRLS are in the midst of their
dance performance BACK TO

EXT RANDYS HOUSE BACKYARD - NIGHT

A HAND reaches into the pool grabs onto Sams arm and pulls
in

her up --

She breaches the surface of the water gasping for breath --
back to reality She sees that Randy is the one responsible
for pulling her out

RANDY
You fall asleep down there

He Ruth and the others are looking down at her laughing
Sam is lost in thought struck by her vision

She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
jump into the pool beside her Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot

approval and Randy Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
right behind her

Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
are and fewer people When she arrives there shes
surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel

CHRIS
Thought you could maybe use this

As Chris hands her the towel he notices a wide SCAR on the
inside of Sams RIGHT WRIST but doesnt mention it Sam

wraps the towel around her sopping wet body

Corey looks over and sees her getting out

EXT RANDYS HOUSE PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers

CHRIS
So whats so wrong at home that you
had to take off

The question takes Sam by surprise

CHRIS (CONTD)
Id love to get outta here someday
too just dont know quite where
Id go

Sam decides to open up a little
SAM
I hate it there Its like everyone
knows everything about me but Im
invisible at the same time Its
like the worst of both worlds

CHRIS
Small towns How “bout your family

SAM
They didnt want me to leave
well they did but they wanted me
to go away to Harvard or something
like that like my sister

Sam takes a big sip of her beer showing signs of tipsiness

SAM (CONTD)
Sometimes I think it wouldve been
easier if I just after my
BROTHER-

Sam stops herself

CHRIS
What

SAM
(changing gears)
Thats why I love Corey she just
doesnt give a shit She does what
she wants and she doesnt care what
people think

CHRIS
You just gotta be yourself thats
all What is it you wanna do

SAM
I always thought Id be a dancer

Sam is self-conscious after admitting this

SAM (CONTD)
That sounds kinda stupid probably

CHRIS
No

SAM
When I was younger my dance team
was on Star Search

CHRIS

Yeah but I didnt go

CHRIS

Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless
splashing and goofing around with some BOYS

kind of judgement or something

CHRIS

CHRIS (CONTD)
Sam wait hey come on

starts

an

missing

her

EXT RANDYS HOUSE SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be
alone She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard but
no one else is in sight

Still soaking wet she plants herself on the stoop and

to pound the rest of her drink

A strange abrupt HARD CUT TO

EXT STREET IN FRONT OF RANDYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randys A
lone flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in

orange glow

She is completely dry wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
JEANS with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
hand The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
forehead

A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form

her by inches She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
of Randys house which is about 20 yards away

SAMS LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS

Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex
phosphorescent grid that is Sams field of vision VECTOR
SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR insert a SIPHON

and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE

DRUNK GUY 1
Hurry up

Although she is close by they take no notice of Sam
whatsoever ANOTHER CAR speeds by again nearly crushing

but she doesnt flinch

She stands and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
of the road where unlike the Drunk Guys there is someone

straight

over

right

who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in

DITCH near a CULVERT --

ANGLE CULVERT

Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch Tom stares at
her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask

From one end of the broad open culvert they can see
through to the other side

A PORTAL starts to take shape within swirling around the
circumference Soft BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
phosphorescent glow and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
enough to make them falter

On the opposite end of the culvert a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT
flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of
FATHER HOMEIJERS CHURCH --

EXT CHURCH - NIGHT

Tom and Sam stand outside the church The STEEPLE reigns
them Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS
and approach the great WOOD DOORS

INT CHURCH - NIGHT

Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS Tom strides past
her in a daze moving toward the PULPIT

Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
Calvary each standing over 4 feet tall

Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER above the pulpit to the

where two walls and the ceiling meet

SAMS LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT

The three planes come together at an irregular angle with
and

face

the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD and the CEILING
SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD

PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines
with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture

A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Toms chest where he
stands below it reaching higher and higher

As Toms SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point the
BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --

ANGLE BETWEEN THE WALLS

Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and
outer walls Claustrophobic dusty and obscure

Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them and Tom barely has
enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger

COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE A SPARK A BLUE
FLAME

Heat and pressure build The old dry wood begins to CREAK

SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE

OVER WHITE

The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away then become present
again Louder now and different A BANGING

INT MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY

Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her

Shes lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
beds

Shes alone and naked except for the sheet Her WET CLOTHES
are in a heap beside her Her head is throbbing

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG

She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR
IE MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes Sam opens the door

to
find Phil the motel owner He does not look pleased
PHIL

EXT BANK - DAY
Sam approaches the bank and when she sees the tall SIGN
with
the digital clock she stops and stares up at it It strikes
a chord but she doesnt know why
The sign reads 1248 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20 1995 It
changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN 14 DAYS 8 HOURS 11
MINUTES 22 SECONDS 21 SECONDS
INT BANK - DAY
Sam enters the small bank and as she approaches the counter
she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears Some of her FEMALE

TRUDY

SAM

SAM

TRUDY

Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam

TRUDY (CONTD)

that have been made against him

Corey rides shotgun in Randys car chewing on some greasy
FAST FOOD looking quite content Randy is behind the wheel
with a BEER in his hand and Mike Jeff and Ruth are packed
into the back passing around a JOINT

MIKE
How many cheeseburgers did we get

RUTH
Like eight

Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit
chases it with some beer

JEFF
Wait did we get smokes

Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when
they turn a corner and see whats left of the church

MIKE RANDY
Whoa Jesus Christ

POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS

POLICE and FIREMEN swarm Father Homeijer stands with
Officer
ODell gazing at the soggy ruins The only things standing
amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount
Calvary But they arent completely intact --

EXT CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES

All three are bent drastically forward sagging down toward
the murky ground

OFFICER ODELL (0S)
Musta melted from the heat

Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis beside
himself with bitterness and sorrow

FATHER HOMEIJER
Theyre made of silver-plated
steel A simple fire couldnt do
that

OFFICER ODELL
What are you sayin

FATHER HOMEIJER
This is an extension of Satans own
hand Ive seen it coming

Rolling his eyes ODell walks away leaving the priest to
grieve for his church in private

EXT JUNKYARD STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON

COREY

SAM
The motel guy came to the room this
morning all pissed off Were

money to pay for the car

Corey sighs debating weather or not to get out Before she
can reach a decision something in the department stores
parking lot catches her eye a LITTLE BOY with dark hair
wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT

But she blinks and hes gone having disappeared between two
parked vehicles

Confused Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car

RANDY
Should I wait a minute

JEFF
We gotta get some smokes

COREY

you later on

RANDY

Alright Later
Corey gets out and shuts the door Randy speeds off toward

intersection about 20 yards ahead

INT DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Chris is at work stocking shelves inside the department
store

He checks his watch stops what hes doing and grabs a PACK
OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
break

EXT INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randys
car is stopped at a red light

SAM
We just gotta figure out what were
gonna do I dont think-

COREY
(ABRUPT)
Lemme guess you wanna go home

SAM
What

COREY
You wanna run back to mommy and
daddy and say sorry so they can put

have that option

SAM
(taken aback)

COREY
Ill go home and get the shit

Theyre almost to the light which is still red and coming
up on Randys car Jeff Mike and Ruth stare out at them

the backseat smelling the drama
COREY (CONTD)

I knew youd bail on me eventually
but not this quick

SAM
Im not bailing on you Would you
JUST-

COREY

You can fucking sleepwalk back to
Middlesex for all I care Im not
driving you youre a fucking
drag

The light turns green and Randys car peels across the
intersection making a left

SAM
Fuck you Corey

Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street storming
straight across Corey starts to follow but something
stops her in her tracks BILLY MOORCROFT

He stands on the opposite side of the intersection in the
trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesnt see him

Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT He
looks pale and weak and is covered with BRUISES He stares
right back at Corey as transfixed as she is TIME SLOWS
DOWN Note Sams position is in the middle of the road
Randys car has made the left but is still in the vicinity

the intersection

Bewildered Corey tries to step out into the street but
something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
forward progress impossible

RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she

it She looks up following the ripples with her eyes and
watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision into
the

infinite space

She reaches forth with her hand wanting to feel the barrier
once again Just as she touches it REAL TIME RESUMES --

KA-BOOM

FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
RANDYS CAR He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on

front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --

Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH

Randy careens into the opposite lane and an ONCOMING CAR
smacks him dead on The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road

The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --

-- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD

The world goes SILENT
CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE

WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
USED TO BE

SAMS BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET MOTIONLESS

BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE COREY
STANDS FROZEN HORRIFIED IN UTTER SHOCK

INT POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer ODells desk the
expression of shock still glued to her face ODell sits
facing her

OFFICER ODELL
Youre sure you didnt see a
driver

COREY
No
He takes the statement from her

OFFICER ODELL
Well youre one lucky girl to have
gotten outta the car when you did
Front passenger side was wiped
right out Coulda been two dead
girls today instead of one

Corey nods taking this in

OFFICER ODELL (CONTD)
I talked to Randy and sent him home
a little while ago Hes pretty
shook up

Corey doesnt respond ODell leans in to speak to her in
confidence

OFFICER ODELL (CONTD)
Both of us know hed been doin
some drinkin today But we also
know hes not at fault here That
old beater cut right in front him

COREY
Cant you just look up the license
plates

OFFICER ODELL
No plates on the vehicle Were
investigating the VIN but that
could take a little more time
depending on the history of
ownership Well find him

Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject

COREY
What about the missing boy

ODell shifts in his chair

OFFICER ODELL
You really think it was him huh

COREY
He was on the side of the road
right before the accident
OFFICER ODELL
Im no psychiatrist but I do know
sometimes shock does funny
things

COREY
You think I was hallucinating

OFFICER ODELL
We were on the scene five minutes
after the accident I think
somebody woulda noticed a little
boy wandering around

He sees how troubled Corey is

OFFICER ODELL (CONTD)
Why dont you stop in and see Dr
Peters on your way out right
down the hall there Shell give
you somethin to make you feel
better

Corey nods and gets up to leave As shes on her way out
ODells voice stops her

OFFICER ODELL (CONTD)

Oh uh is there anything you
wanted to say to Samanthas
parents

Coreys expression is blank

COREY
Like what

EXT POLICE STATION BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Shes

about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the

police station behind her

CHRIS

Grateful for his presence Corey moves to stand behind

Tom shuffles away

CHRIS (CONTD)

INT MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING

Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor froma
plastic cup She sits down on one of the full-size beds

Sams belongings are spread out

She opens Sams backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF
TRAVEL book by Roberta Sparrow

As Corey studies the cover her image is reflected by the
CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS The angle of the mirrors creates double
image reflections for other objects in the room Strangely
Coreys reflection is only present in one of the panes

The digital CLOCKRADIO shows 630 PM

There are PICTURES of Sams family tucked away inside the
book between the pages Sam with her mother and father

and EDDIE DARKO YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE an old
photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds
ARIEL a STUFFED TOY UNICORN

Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the

nightstand

fabric

She then looks down and notices that the book is open to
CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE

COREY
Fragmentary Universe

She pours over the text some of which reads When the
of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes
corrupted a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary

Universe can occur sustaining itself for no longer than
several days FADE TO BLACK

up in bed The clockradio reads 330 AM The CRYING is

but steady and sorrowful

from outside

EXT MOTEL - NIGHT

Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING

MACHINES on the side of the building

until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them
freezes a few feet away from the boy

Corey sees that he is not crying -- its coming from

elsewhere in the cosmos
DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks

BILLY MOORCROFT
You need to save me Corey

Corey stares at him in disbelief

BILLY MOORCROFT (CONTD)
You need to save me and save the

Why cant anyone see you

BILLY MOORCROFT

think youre a dummy

COREY

Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him

BILLY MOORCROFT (CONTD)

She sits

and sounds as though its coming

Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING
stops her The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go
back to normal PRICES the CRYING SOUND CEASES and Billy
disappears

PHIL (0S)

Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes
having come out of a room near the lobby Shes dumbstruck

PHIL

Phil goes back inside leaving her alone

shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a
PLASTIC BAG

Corey takes it from him and looks inside CANDY BARS a BAG
OF CHIPS some PEANUTS a pack of CIGARETTES

INT LIBRARY MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON

Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped dim booth
near the back of the library They stare at a MICROFILM
ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKOS DEATH

CHRIS
That was Sams brother

COREY
Yeah

On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many
PEOPLE gathered in front of it A JET ENGINE is being lifted
away by a CRANE

CHRIS
Her parents must be going through
hell

COREY

Sam said once she wished it landed
on her room instead of Donnies

Chris thinks on this

CHRIS
I saw something on Sams wrist the
other night it looked like a
scar

COREY

She told me it was from some
accident Put her hand through a
window or something

CHRIS
Did you believe her

Corey doesnt answer She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE one that
chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no
known origin
A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED

A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the
air

CHRIS (CONTD)
God

Chris is horrified Corey is totally engrossed

She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY
who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky A
PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the
Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothys house fell on her in
Munchkinland

CHRIS (CONTD)
I dont understand why were
lookin at this stuff

COREY
They still never found a driver to
that car that hit Randy I was
standing right there I didnt see

CHRIS

I was pretty close too but

off

COREY
I found this book in Sams backpack
last night Theres a chapter where
it talks about stuff like this
happening Like a guy being killed
by an arrow that nobody shot anda
swordsmith getting killed by a
sword he hadnt made yet
Unexplainable things but it says
theres a reason why they happen

CHRIS
A book I dont get what your
talkin about What was the reason

Corey thinks trying to figure out the right way to express
something

Corey sighs and turns back to the screen
COREY (CONTD)
You already think Im a freak show
INT LIBRARY FRONT DESK - AFTERNOON

As Chris and Corey are on the way out they notice Jeremy

They get out and start to walk up to the garage but theyre

The dog heels at the sound of the voice and Ruth bolts out
of the house and takes her by the collar Shes got a

over a cut on her forehead

He walks them over to the car finishing off his sandwich
wiping his hands on his greasy jeans

DUSTY (CONTD)
Your engine seized up when your
water pump blew

COREY

DUSTY
I understand But I already
ordered the water pump and Ill

Dusty is perturbed

FATHER HOMEIJER
Good afternoon

TRUDY

tragic fire

FATHER HOMEIJER
Any small amount you could manage

CHRIS
Sorry

Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the

FATHER HOMEIJER

They turn and walk away and Chris rolls his window back up

CHRIS
Everybody wants somethin

CHRIS

COREY
You wouldnt give me stuff and
drive me around if you didnt want

CHRIS

COREY
“Cause thats just not how it

CHRIS

Maybe youre wrong about that
Corey nods but still doesnt believe him

COREY
See ya

She gets out and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room

INT MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT

Corey lays on her stomach in bed her head buried in The
Philosophy of Time Travel book The TELEVISION is on in the
bg (out of focus) playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL
INFOMERCIAL

Suddenly there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE
runs over the TV screen

Corey looks around taking no notice of the odd change on
the

television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMANS VOICE HULK HOGAN

is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL

Just then there is a KNOCK at the door She gets up to
answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught

RANDY
Do you hate me

COREY
Huh

RANDY
You think its my fault shes dead

COREY
No

RANDY
You mean it

COREY
Yeah it wasnt your fault

Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted

RANDY
Whats that

Corey looks down and realizes that shes still holding The
Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand

COREY
Oh its just something of
Sams
Randy nods Corey tosses the book onto the bed

You wanna get outta here for a
while I got my dads car
IE RANDYS DADS CARLOOKOUT - NIGHT

RANDYS DADS CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to

VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen SPARSE
LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization

There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout most
up

containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low

Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING

other cars but still with a nice view

RANDY

Ive been comin up here since I
was a kid Good place when you

wanna just get away from
everything

Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion River of Deceit
Season) then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it

COREY
Is Ruth your girlfriend

Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it

RANDY

Naw were just friends Shes
pretty weird sometimes Too like

intense or something

COREY
Seems like you guys are pretty
close

RANDY
Yeah dont worry about Ruth

Randy takes another hit and holds it in

COREY
Do you ever have a hard time

telling whats real and whats not

real

Randy exhales and looks over at her perplexed

RANDY

Sometimes sometimes something
can feel really real but its just
your mind playing tricks on you

COREY

Ive got so much shit in my head
right now Ive never felt so

away from the

by Mad

outta control I think Im really
goin psycho

He passes her the joint

RANDY
I got some acid from my buddy one
time this like flying eagle
pyramid shit I took two hits and
man next thing I knew I was on
the floor curled up in ball and
Mike and Jeff were just standing
there lookin down at me I could
see this like glowing grid cutting
through my brain and I knew when
it got all the way through Id be
this sketched out vegetable I
could picture my dad staring down
at me in the hospital in my
straightjacket crying and shit

Corey blows out a hit captivated

RANDY (CONTD)
The whole time my esophagus was
like twisting and turning in my
throat and cutting off my air

supply it was terrible
COREY

Jesus
RANDY

I can still slip back into it
sometimes but I know now that my
brain is whats making it real
and thats like a blessing and a
curse man ‘cause that means you
have to decide whats real and
whats not

COREY
The things that feel the most real
right now are impossible More

like a dream

Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in
the
cars ashtray
RANDY
I know what you mean The scariest
part is thinking youre not the
same person anymore Somethings

Theyre about to kiss when --

it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS
POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively

A large BLACK and WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE UP of

Randy puts his hands on her hips running them up her torso
Corey turns to face him

They kiss

and fall back onto the bed

A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randys DESK shows 330 AM Theres a
SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift changing briefly to

Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare She sits up and looks
around remembering where she is She discovers Randy asleep
by her side She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
the bed and grabs her shirt

as

after she pulls it on over her head she freezes --
because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his
BIRTHDAY HAT staring at her

BILLY MOORCROFT
Only one day left

Corey turns and looks down to Randy Hes still fast asleep

COREY
What am I supposed to do

As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery
liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest

Billy is now gone but her SPEAR beckons her out of the

elongating to illustrate her path Corey is in awe

INT RANDYS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Her SPEAR leads her through the living room and past the
sleeping bodies of Mike Jeff and Ruth Following her path
leads her to step on RUTHS FOOT as she goes by

Corey doesnt even notice but one of Ruths eyes pop open

she treads out the door

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Corey follows Billy who walks in the middle of the road
about 15 yards ahead of her The residential street is
guarded by great OLD TREES on either side

The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP and a BUCKLE in
space-time materializes

Theres a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
THUNDER and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive
swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
dimensional realm of darkest night

The VOID brightens and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL
RAINS are visible within
Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTYS HOUSE

In contrast to the street all is nearly SILENT in Dustys
garage Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter

WITHOUT SOUND ghostly JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS

Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay Some of the PARTS have

already
been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
the floor
Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the
corner
BILLY MOORCROFT
You can do it
COREY
How

Its easy
Corey focuses on the sink and it begins to tremble The
pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN WATER starts to bubble up
from the sink drain also in the shower
Billy stands atop her car watching her His perpetually
morose expression transforms into a smile
The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure As Corey
stares

at the DRAWING that hes working on

from stepping into the street

She quickens her pace almost there when --

Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH

Randy careens into the opposite lane and an ONCOMING CAR
smacks him dead on The inertia from the oncoming vehicle

plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road

The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
skitters harmlessly across the intersection --

Its horrible but sometimes
these things can happen for a
reason Sometimes good can come of

it growth ya know

SAM
What the fuck are you talking

Sams benumbed expression doesnt change but her tone is
caustic

CHRIS
All I meant was sometimes-

SAM
I know what you meant and its

reason you cant just make one up
to fill the void and make yourself
feel better It sucks and it fucks
everything up but it doesnt mean

INT MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING

Sam swallows her PILLS with some water and sits down on one
of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK

She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
TRAVEL book by Roberta Sparrow As she studies the cover
her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS

The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections

other objects in the room and Sams reflection is present
in both of the panes

The digital CLOCKRADIO shows 630 PM

She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside
the book Sam with her mother and father Sam as a child

her sister and brother an old photo of the whole Darko
family together

Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie
and she puts them all down She touches the SCAR on the

part of her right wrist

She then glances down and notices that the book is open to

Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED
SWEATSHIRT and JEANS with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped
around her right hand The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the
GASH by her temple

SAMS LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD

She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE
DEAD CARS MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as
stationary objects within the complex grid A PAIR OF RATS
follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a
RUSTY TRACTOR

Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness past the heaps
of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the
CORRUGATED ROOFING

ANGLE STORAGE SHACK

She stands before the shack having discovered Vietnam Tom

He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter and
looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --

He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL
has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY

SAM
Hi Tom I like your new mask

Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as
runs her fingers down one of the LONG METALLIC EARS down
one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN

SAM (CONTD)
Are you scared

As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes
that

shoulder

transparent and the NEURONS in TOMS BRAIN can be seen
sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES in turn RELEASING
NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS

SAM (CONTD)
I know you can hear me

A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder
enclosing them Tom rises afraid Sam takes his hand

The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend
inward then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --

EXT BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING

Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead

It happens again and when she looks around she realizes
shes underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-
SHIRT barefoot lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE

that leads down to the road below

Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current
position she shifts her body and starts to slide down the
SLOPE

Once on even ground she notices a brand new 95 BMW coming
toward her

SAM
Perfect

Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window

JEREMY

Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her

drives

MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of the WATER TANK in an

attempt to wash off the burn marks resembling the nearly

imperceptible image of the MONSTER BUNNYS FACE

IE JEREMYS BMWMOTEL - MORNING
Jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot Sam hesitates for a
moment before getting out

JEREMY
I heard about your friend

Sam doesnt say anything so he goes on

JEREMY (CONTD)
I wasnt gonna say anything but
then I thought I probably should
because if I didnt it might be

inconsiderate
SAM
Well okay Thanks
A beat
JEREMY
So what are you gonna do
SAM

I dont know yet

Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face still not
wanting to go inside the motel room

SAM (CONTD)
Do you believe that everything
happens for a reason

JEREMY
I know that for every action
theres an equal and opposite

reaction
SAM

Yeah I learned that in science
JEREMY

And everything in the universe is
in constant motion as the universe
is constantly expanding

SAM
Yeah but do you believe that
everything happens for a reason
like in life

JEREMY
You mean like destiny

Jeremy thinks on this for a moment

JEREMY (CONTD)
I think everyone has a purpose
Something theyre meant to do Like
potential but more clear-cut For
instance I was destined to get my
hands on the meteorite

SAM
Really

JEREMY
Im making amazing discoveries
every day practically sleeping at
the lab

While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches
nervously at his left forearm It draws Sams attention away

from what hes saying

JEREMY (CONTD)
Im still doing some tests but
theres a metallic substance thats
not showing up on the elemental
CHARTS-

SAM
What happened to your arm

Jeremy stops scratching A small area on the inner part of
his wrist is RAW and RED partially SCABBED OVER

JEREMY
Its just a rash

Sam starts to get out of the car

He offers her a wad of cash Sam hesitates

SAM
BUT-

JEREMY
I know you need it Its no big
deal
She accepts the money

As they move down the line and approach Sam she tenses up

Aware of Sams financial situation she gives Father

Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground looking out
over all of El Reno He peers at the twinkling lights
through
his scrap metal BUNNY MASK and cradles his RIFLE in his
arms

like a soldier at rest

He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to
him facing the landscape She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT
JEANS and the BANDAGE The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her
forehead

You wanna know what happens when
you die

She looks at Tom

SAM (CONTD)
I really want to die

Tom aims his gun at her face

He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them
because when the barrel of the gun touches it the barrier
bends and becomes slightly opaque

Sam is expressionless Toms finger trembles as he places it
on the trigger

He aims down the guns sights directly at Sams RIGHT EYE
and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
system on the force field Sams eye is in the CENTRAL

QUADRANT

Tom pulls the trigger TIME SLOWS DOWN

A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel
mmediately after a BULLET is discharged and follows it

The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid but when
the BULLET reaches it the entire force field curves to
accommodate the penetrating force

fq

The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sams eye but
then it stops The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
spot centimeters from her face --

drive off together

INT LAB - DAY

Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab

There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION

ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT

As he walks to a desk near the back he can barely contain
his excitement Sam follows taking note of a LARGE RABBIT

in
an extremely SMALL CAGE
JEREMY
Heres my station
He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and
retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-
like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it
SAM
Thats it
JEREMY
The rest is locked away somewhere
else somewhere safe Everyones
gonna want a piece of this thing
pretty soon
He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and
turns

it on He places the meteorite slice in the microscopes
VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR

JEREMY (CONTD)
You ever seen one of these

SAM
No

JEREMY
Its a scanning electron
microscope It uses electrons
instead of light to scan the image

A BLACK and WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscopes MONITOR --
its a geometric collage of all shapes and shades

JEREMY (CONTD)
At first I thought it was a
siderite but then I saw it was
more than that Much more It does
have a percentage of nickel and
iron in it as I first suspected
But it also has something else

He waits for Sam to take the bait

SAM
And whats that

He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor Their
shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding
them

JEREMY
An unrecognizable element Ive
done all the tests It doesnt
exist on the periodic table

Jeremy is practically beaming

SAM
So this is pretty major

JEREMY
This is history Im thinking of
calling it framium

SAM
Framium
JEREMY
For my last name Frame
SAM
What if its like proof of some

alien life-form from another galaxy
or something

Jeremys tone becomes serious

his left forearm as he talks

As Jeremy

JEREMY
Its very important you promise me
you wont tell anyone else what
Ive showed you I have to wait
till just the right moment NASA
or some secret government
organization could come in here and
take it away from me

gets more worked up he scratches harder

JEREMY (CONTD)
And then later on years from now
take credit for the discovery
themselves

SAM
I wont say anything

JEREMY
Good

Sam stares at him for a long beat as if examining him

SAM
Theres this book I think youd
like I got it from my physics

teacher in high school

JEREMY
The study of physics has unraveled
some of the most profound mysteries
of the universe

SAM
Its called The Philosophy of Time
Travel

JEREMY
Time travel

SAM
Yeah but its not really that
Its more like one scenario or one
type of scenario I dont
completely understand it

and he starts to scratch at
Sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor

SAM (CONTD)
Another mystery

JEREMY
What do you mean

SAM
My life seems to be full of them

JEREMY
Mysteries are what make life
interesting

Sam doesnt agree or disagree Shes become tense because
Jeremys face is now in close proximity to hers

JEREMY (CONTD)
Youre a mystery to me Samantha

He goes in for a kiss but Sam gently pushes him away

JEREMY (CONTD)
Ow

Jeremy retreats shielding his left arm Sam looks down and
sees that the red raw area has turned into a much bigger
RASH covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto
his forearm

SAM
That doesnt look good

JEREMY
I should get some Hydrocortisone

He looks pathetic and Sam feels sorry for him

SAM
(regarding the attempted
KISS)
Sorry about that

JEREMY
Im sorry I shouldve know better
You barely know me right

SAM
And nobody really calls my

Samantha Just my mom and dad

Jeremy manages a smile and Sam smiles back

The fireworks illuminate his torso and she is appalled to
see that the raw reddish RASH has spread to cover the

his jacket and puts it back on

He zips up his jacket tight

SAM

JEREMY

The question takes Sam by surprise
SAM

Before Sam can finish Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for
forceful kiss

Sam shoves him away sharply

starts to double over but recovers quickly and smacks her

across the face --

JEREMY (CONTD)

Sam is stunned and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and

SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple

She struggles no more

He stoops by her picks her up and hugs her limp body
close

As he does this Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him
Chris turns to face him but says nothing still holding Sam
The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them

Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment then reaches

down and picks up his BUNNY MASK The EVIL GRIN is red with
SAMS BLOOD and one of the teeth is missing

The last of the fireworks display occurs leaving the night
full of SMOKE HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of
bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE

Amongst the churning clouds a tornado-like PORTAL cuts
through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town Its
swirling and vast stretching down from limitless space

of wood and metal strewn everywhere Ground water spurts

A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
crater

Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and ODell arrive
on the scene There are PARAMEDICS a CORONER and other
POLICEMEN there as well and a large area has been cordoned
off with POLICE TAPE

Corey is there looking on as well as Chris Holt Phil
Coulter and other local CITIZENS TOMS REMAINS are carried

off in a BLACK BAG

Oh my God

Sam moves to stand by Corey The overall mood is grim and
Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face

FRANK
I dont believe it

The Firemen drop the porous misshapen clod by his feet
SKI

FRANK (CONTD)
This is just a tragedy

Officer ODell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
with his boot
