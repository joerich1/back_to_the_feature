ONCE UPON A TTME IN SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES

We hear voices one male the other female From the tone of
their speech and the accompanying music we can tell we are
entering a romantic scene

FADE IN
INT FANCY NEW YORK APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Where we see a romantic scene played out between a man and a
woman Both are white The couple have just finished a
candlelit dinner

BRAD
You like your wine Want smore

She nods her approval

PENELOPE
Mmmmm youre good Candles dinner
wine Whats next

He grins

BRAD
Let me set the mood

He goes over to the stereo to turn it on The Isley Brothers
Between the Sheets emanates from the speakers Brad crosses
to the couch and into a position in which to kiss Penelope
He does and the sound of Between the Sheets is invaded by
the remix of A Tribe Called Quests Bonita Applebum

EXT COMPTON DRIVE-IN THEATER - DUSK - SFX

Two lines of cars wait to enter the drive-in The heavy bass
sounds of hip-hop music mingle in the air with that of the
many window speakers that plag the movie In the background
we can see the couple in the previous scene kissing on a
large movie screen An LAPD helicopter flies overhead
transcending us into the next shot Welcome back to South
Central Los Angeles

INT COMPTON DRIVE-IN THEATER - DUSK - SFX

Overhead we see a shaft of Light coming from the drive-ins
projector As we move past a few cars their inhabitants are
all in various threes of sexual foreplay Some are kissing
others are actually making love All the windows are steamed
up We hear the voices of the females as the men grunt groan
moan and beg over their bodies Love is in the air
CAR 1
Dont bite me so hard You gotta be
more gentle

CAR 2
(softly)
Use your tongue Just use your tongue

CAR 3
(with heated passion)
Ohhhh Oh yes ohhh Oww Im
sticking to the seat

We come to the last car whose windows are crystal clear
Things are just beginning to heat up between the couple inside
the car The woman is an around the way honey with soft
brown skin full brown eyes and nice delicious full lips
This is Justice who at seventeen is still looking for her
place in the world The lucky man kissing her is her
boyfriend Markell a small-time drug dealer and former
gangsta Justice reluctantly accepts his advances but she
aint having it There is a window speaker from which the
sound of the movie Alters into the car

MARKELL
Cmon lets get in the back seat

JUSTICE
No Markell why cant we just watch
the movie

MARKELL
Cause its boring

He goes to kiss her again This time its a nice long
juicy powerhouse kiss that causes the Richter scale to jump
two points Justice appears obviously affected She asks the
inevitable question

JUSTICE
Markell do you love me

MARKELL
Of course I love you

JUSTICE
Why Tell me why you love me

MARKELL
(looks around)
Now

JUSTICE
Yeah right now
There is a pause He thinks

MARKELL
Okay I love you because you too
fine

JUSTICE
Is that it

MARKELL
Yeah

Justice looks dissatisfied

MARKELL
Can I have some sugar Some butter
Some sweets

JUSTICE
No not yet Get me some popcorn

Markell s face drops

JUSTICE
Pleazzze

Markell relents and gets out of the car He takes two steps
turns on a heel and leans into the car again

MARKELL
Hey Justice I was just thinking I
also love you ‘cause when I was in
tha county jail you wrote me a lotta
Sweet poems

Justice grins Markell smiles and blows her a kiss good-bye
INTCOMPTON DRIVE-IN CONCESSION STAND - NIGHT

There are only a few customers in line all are Black or
Hispanic Markell gets in line and time slows down We notice
the abruptness of the popcorn popping like gunshots the
sound and motion of the gurgling Orange Bang machine and
two thugs who stand in the corner talking to each other
Markell seems noticeably nervous at their presence

THE COUNTER

Where Markell finally arrives at the front of the line

THE CORNER

Where one of the two thugs looks across the room at Markell

For a moment it looks as though he recognizes Markell He
turns back to continue to talk with his friend

A fight breaks out in another corner and everyones attention
is drawn in that direction

BACK TO COUNTER

Markell completes his transaction amidst the mayhem and walks
away popcorn in hand In the corner the thug looks back
toward the counter On his face we see he now recalls where
he has seen Markell before

INT EXT COMPTON DRIVE-IN - THE CAR - NIGHT

Markell comes back to the car glancing behind his back every
so often

MARKELL
(looking over his
left shoulder)
I think I saw these fools that Pete
and I got beef with

Markell turns to notice that Justice is not in the passenger
seat Justice leans up from the back seat to kiss his cheek
and tenderly run her fingers around Markells neck and
shoulder We notice her long fingernails Markell laughs and
places the popcorn on the dashboard Our attention is drawn
to the passenger window where the drive-in speaker hangs
Romantic movie music flows into the car On the drivers

side the window is open Suddenly a pistol is placed next

to Markells head Time slows down The gun is fired Justice
screams The popcorn scatters and the passenger window breaks
from the traveling bullet Time resumes Justices screams
turn to a whimper There is blood on her hands The drive-in
speaker has now fallen on the passenger seat We hear the
romantic movie playing in the background

OVERHEAD
AS WE PULL UP and away from the car There are people running
and screaming in every direction and cars are leaving These
sounds overlap into
