I can’t really tell you I was that
sleepy I only remember that there were
people around but I’m not sure who
exactly I basically had my eyes shut
sort of thing

LECKIE
You don’t remember who you heard

J
(pauses)
The reason I was so sleepy and don’t
remember was because I smoked some
marijuana and I was knocked out sort
of thing I didn’t want to tell you
that

with what you smoked

whatever that youre a strong
creature But youre not Youre one

This things going to trial with or

want is to win it What I liked about
the committal hearing - despite the
fact that weve been ordered to stand
trial of course - but what I liked
about the committal was that for the
most part their case looked pretty
flimsy to me largely dependent on
testimony that shouldnt be too hard
to discredit I wouldnt have thought
And if the committal was any
indicator J heres their little star
If hes not there theyll need to
strengthen their brief with something
else which they will do And theyll
have the time to do it And Id
personally rather tackle the evidence
I saw at the committal than whatever
rejigged brief they come up with
should J suddenly decide to leave You
know what I mean

(to J)
So now we should just make proper use
of the time we have Well need to go
over a bunch of things here Like for
instance this whole business of the
car you claim you stole and that you
claim you saw on the TV It was just a
white car wasnt it Millions of white
cars in the world Why was that one so
familiar Probably looked very similar
to that one that guy drives on that
show some show you watch all the
time You know

We dont want him reciting lines All
he needs to do here is get into the

injected her with whats known as a

she known to you to be a user of
heroin

it Even though you didn’t see them do
it and she was justifiably upset on
this particular night because you
ended the relationship
