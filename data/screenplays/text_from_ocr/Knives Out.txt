Joni with her things Walt with his
publishing empire

LINDA
Well

Doesnt push anything Just waits a moment

LINDA (contd)

well with what dads given him
Walt - not like it matters but he was
sort of adrift dad gave him the job
but really dad hands him a book twice
a year and Walt publishes it I
mean its just not the same

BLANC
But surely Walt runs the
merchandising adaptations film and
television rights

Linda squints narrowing her eyes on Blanc Softly

LINDA
Are you baiting me Detective You
know he doesnt and you think Im
dumb enough to be baited into talking
family business into shit talking my
brother in front of a police
detective and a state trooper -

Richard in the chair

RICHARD
Walt doesnt run shit There are no
film or TV rights Harlans never
allowed any adaptations of his books
Hates the idea

Did he get into it at the party

RICHARD
Oh my god

WALT

Dad you put me in charge of our books

Joni hesitates we FLASH BACK

INT SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY

Harlan at his desk toying with the same old baseball This
is a thing he does at his desk Joni standing arms crossed

JONI
The school hasnt got the check yet
I dont know why Alan didnt mail it

HARLAN

Phylliss office that handles your
yearly allowance has been wiring the
tuition money directly to you as
well As per your request Youve
been double dipping Megs tuition

Jonis speechless her face frozen Harlan puts the
baseball down and detaches the check holds it out to her

HARLAN (contd)
My minds made up

INT LIBRARY

INT SMALL STUDY

LINDA (0S)
Richard

Alone Richard waits very still for Lindas footsteps to
walk away then when he knows shes not coming in he
furtively rifles through desk drawers finding various
ridiculous ephemera He finds a small locked drawer
jimmies it open with a letter opener

Inside - the small pink envelope Harlan threatened him with
in his flashback He rips it open pulls out the card
inside

It is blank
Richard almost laughs Drops it onto the desk

RICHARD
Son of a bitch

He spots Harlans old baseball Grabs it spitefully chucks
it out the open window

EXT SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY

Blanc Elliott and Wagner stroll long the wide lawn beside
the house Blanc ignites a long thin cigar

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Maybe Im a victim of my own
expectations But when the great
Benoit Blanc knocks on my door I
expect its going to be for
something if not extraordinary
at least interesting This is an
open and shut case of suicide

(checks watch)

And Benny were at the point where I
need to know what were doing here

Blanc notices the OLD BASEBALL lying in the grass He picks
it up idly
INT FOYER

Marta sits
voices out

She creeps

BLANC
The method throat slit Typical of
a suicide

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Dramatic But look around The guy
practically lives in a CLUE board

alone across from a portrait of Harlan Muffled
on the patio Cigar smoke drifts by outside

over to the glass door Puts her ear to it

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (0S)
You ask me to drag all these good
people back for questioning go over
it all again I dont get it This
is a pleasant family with the usual
quarrels but no possible motives for
murder - where are you going

At that moment BLANCs face appears right next to Martas
staring right at her through the distorted glass She yelps
and falls back

EXT PATIO

Blanc opens the glass door Marta steps back sheepishly
but with a warm nod Blanc beckons for her to join them

BLANC
Harlan Thrombeys nurse Marta

MARTA
-Cabrera

BLANC
Marta Cabrera

TROOPER WAGNER
Miss Cabrera you can just wait
inside - well be with you soon

BLANC

poking youre hired on a part time
basis as a registered nurse yes
Blanc smiles

MARTA
Yeah I dont work for a VNA Harlan
hired me directly

BLANC
Youre paid a flat rate for how many
hours a week

MARTA
I started at 15 but slowly he
needed more help

BLANC
Medical help

MARTA
He needed a friend

at the girl genuinely touched

BLANC
Does having a kind heart make you a
good nurse

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc

BLANC
Yes Marta we were just discussing
possible motives in the family I
suspect Harlan has told you much
unfiltered truth about each of them
and a little bird has told me how
shall I put this delicately You have
a regurgitive reaction to
mistruthin

MARTA
Who told you that

BLANC
Is it true

MARTA
Yes Its something that I have had
as a kid Its a physically thing
that I - I - Just the thought of
lying yeah it makes me puke

BLANC
Really Is Richard having an affair

Marta is stunned She FLASHES BACK TO

EXT PATIO - DAY - FLASHBACK
She reads Harlan sits at his laptop heavy with sadness
HARLAN
Why do men instinctively pull at

loose threads on their parachutes

MARTA
What

Harlan spins his laptop towards her - the Richard photos

EXT PATIO - DAY
Back to our scene Marta looks queasy tries to stall

MARTA
Heh - Richard - affair Heh

BLANC
A yes or no will do

She struggles her jaw clenched face working hard then
attempts -

MARTA
ooee-nO

And immediately VOMITS into a nearby planter

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT TROOPER WAGNER
Whoa Oh my god

They all rush to her Blanc brings water awfully concerned

BLANC
Dear girl Im sorry I assumed you
were speaking figuratively

Blanc takes the shortest acceptable beat of concern before
turning to Elliott

BLANC (contd)
Quite something But I was obviously
right Richard is having an affair
his father in law found out and
confronted him You tell her Or I
will

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Even if its true you ok
Marta gives a weak thumbs up recovering

ELLIOTT
Even if that was right protecting
his marriage is weak sauce as a

motive
BLANC
Well And then there is Joni
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT TROOPER WAGNER
Joni Joni

TROOPER WAGNER (contd)
Lifestyle guru Joni No Harlan was
supporting her and her daughter she
had the opposite of a motive

Marta tries to quietly slip back into the house
BLANC
And if that support was threatened

Miss Cabrera one moment please

MARTA
Im just going to go get some Scope
BLANC
Miss Cabrera was Harlan planning on
cutting off Jonis allowance

Off Martas oh god no face

INT STUDY - DAY - FLASHBACK

Harlan looking at the letter from his business manager

the transaction receipts He sighs heavily
HARLAN
Oh Joni
MARTA

He hands her the letter

EXT PATIO - DAY

Martas face works against impending nausea

with

MARTA
I

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ok dont answer that if youre going
to puke Please

But Blanc presses

BLANC
Meg said Harlan pays the school
directly Joni says he sends the
money to her Both were true she
was pocketing the double payment
Harlan found out and cut her off
without a cent Yes

Marta starts to shake her head no but her throat convulses
She nods Blanc hands her a glass of water

TROOPER WAGNER
And she bumps him off for the
inheritance Come On Have you
seen her insta Shes an influencer

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
An allowance as a motive Blanc She
has her business More weak sauce

Blanc idly scratches a spot on the side of his neck

BLANC
Granted But she lied To me All
three of them did

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Three

BLANC
Walter

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I see where you are going with this

BLANC

But there was something else Harlan
had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights but that night
something Harlan said shook him We
look at the pattern Harlan was
cleaning house I wonder

(to Marta)
did he plan to fire Walter
MARTA
(honest and relieved)
Can I wait inside I dont feel like
I should be here

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes please just wait inside but stay
close

She steps back in grateful Blanc to Elliott

BLANC

Youve been very patient my friend
and you are right none of these weak
alibis and domestic squibbles answer
your question why is Benoit Blanc
here But now I will tell you why

(beat)
I am here because this morning

wasnt there And Marta Harlan was
alive after she left But Meg got
home during the time of death window

both carotids we saw from the blood
blood splat patterns that they were
uninterrupted Meaning Its almost
impossible for anyone to have been
around him at the time Hes the one
that cut his own throat I dont know

The gate is open Martas car pulls up just inside it The
small Guard house next to the gate Blanc Elliott and
Wagner outside it Blanc waves to her

INT GUARD HOUSE

Thrombeys security man MR PROOFROC guides them into the
cramped dusty space Proofroc is old and salty He shows
them old photos of the house stuck to a steel fridge with
big brightly colored fruit magnets

MR PROOFROC
Fifty years I worked this estate you
know security back then meant making
the rounds with a 94 keeping your
ears open Before all this modern
technology

Nothing in the room is newer than 1988 An 8 inch CRT
monitor shows a phosphorescent live feed of the road outside
the gate and a top loaded VHS VCR sits next to it

MR PROOFROC (contd)
Well the video here I saved the tape
from that night usually I erase â€˜em
with the magnetic de-gauser but I
thought better save that one Cause
security Thats the live feed
there

Marta notices something with alarm - the video feed shows
the road outside and at the top edge you can just barely
see the carved elephant that marks the gardeners utility
road She realizes Harlan said

HARLAN (VO)

-to avoid the security cameras
pull off the road AFTER the carved
elephant

Marta keeps a poker face but shit
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(to Proofroc)
Can we see the actual TAPE

MR PROOFROC
Oh sure

CLACK The tape loads into the mechanical VCR An
impossibly grainy smeared night vision view of the road
outside the gate Time stamp 1002pm

TROOPER WAGNER
Its like a Japanese horror movie

MR PROOFROC
(proud)
I record it SSLP gets eight hours
per tape Nine pm to five am

BLANC MARTA
Can we - (to Proofroc)
(to Marta)
Can we scan forward
Can we scan forward

MR PROOFROC
Hold the play button down and press
the FF down halfway till you feel it
grind

Wagner does the machine makes horrible noises and the
picture frizzles and frazzles Then stops and ejects

MR PROOFROC (contd)
And hold the tape down or itll
eject

BLANC
Can your guys digitize it so we can
scan it properly

TROOPER WAGNER
Im sure we can

MARTA
I got it

Marta grabs the tape from the VCR

EXT WOODS - DAY

They all hack through the overgrown gardeners path

TROOPER WAGNER
You know all these statues that you
see around here - they are all
straight out of his series the
menagerie tragedy series pretty
cool

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(dry)
Awesome Blanc the grounds are
lovely but you think what someone
broke into the house To kill
Harlan Is that why were out here

BLANC
I think its an unlikely but if they
did there will be traces

TROOPER WAGNER
Ill take that thanks maam

Marta hands Wagner the VHS tape Then she discretely
pockets something she had held in her hand next to it -a
few of the bright fruit MAGNETS from Proofrocs fridge

EXT THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD

The group hikes up out of the woods towards the low wall
with a small pedestrian gate that leads to the east lawn

Marta is out in front During the following she notices
something The earth around and under the gate is soft and
bare And clear as day HER FOOTPRINTS from the other
night the only ones from womens shoes The same ones she
has on now Her breath catches SHIT

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Any luck with - whatshisname

TROOPER WAGNER
Ransom No but we have an address
Ten Kenoak street

BLANC
Ten Kenoak Thats a pleasant thing
to say kenoak I awoke amid
Kenoak

TROOPER WAGNER
Ugh this mud my boots are going to
stink

BLANC
Mud - has it rained the past week
No - Nobody move Freeze Everyone
These footprints must not be
disturbed
(sees)
Marta

Marta has already walked through the pedestrian gate and up
onto the lawn stepping in her pre-existing prints She
turns back playing dumb

MARTA
What

BLANC
Dont - stop there dont -

MARTA
I cant hear you what

She trots back to them through the gate stepping into her
returning prints

BLANC
No no no no dont - dont step on
the ok alright Aughhhhh ok

MARTA
What

Blanc sidesteps up to the gate not stepping in the mud

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Alright Wagner lets get the boys on
it check the prints tape off this
area keep it clear

The dogs come running down the lawn barking at the men
They tear through the gate further messing up the mud

MARTA
Hey boys easy Hey Hey

She pets them and they quiet down
BLANC
Best judge of character is a dog

Ive found that to be true

The dogs start BARKING and bolt towards the house where
Richard and Linda are pulling up in their lux SUV

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Theyre doing the will reading at
ten whole family will be here soon

Elliott heads up towards the house Blanc meanders up the
lawn and Marta follows

MARTA
Ive never been to a will reading

BLANC
You think itll be like a game show
No Imagine a community theater
performance of a tax return

They approach the side of the house Blanc does a gentle
meandering study of the layout

Marta steals a look at the trellis she climbed

Oh no A piece of the white lattice trellis that broke off
when she was climbing - about eight inches long - lies in
the grass beneath it Her eyes dart up - yup theres the
broken spot Shit

BLANC (contd)
SWEET BEANS

Marta starts - did he spot it No - hes come face to face
with Greatnana standing stock still on the porch She
stares at him like a bird

BLANC (contd)
Good morning Mrs Thrombey

He approaches her slowly When his back is fully turned
Marta takes her shot and KICKS the piece of trellis under
some thick bushes at the base of the house

Blanc and Greatnana stare at each other Blanc gets very
close to her great sympathy in his eyes Greatnana stares
back Its almost like theyre communicating This goes on
for a little too long Then Blanc breaks from the trance
and turns to Marta

BLANC (contd)
Do you think you could handle the
study

INT HARLAN THROMBEYS STUDY

The blood is now only a subtle dark stain but other than
that the room has been left intact from the night of the
party Marta and Wagner observe as Blanc paces the room

BLANC
(to Marta)
Wheres your medical bag

MARTA
I dont know - I left it here I
always leave it with Harlan at night

TROOPER WAGNER
They must have taken it in as
evidence Ill check on it

Blanc picks up the GO board and sets it on the table
Examines its grid idly

BLANC
Howd the GO board get knocked over
MARTA
We were just goofing around
(beat)

What are you thinking

Blanc sighs gently turns the baseball over in his hands
Looks like this was a bust

Blanc tips the GO board over and it lands on the carpet
with a nearly inaudible WHOMPH He stares at it

But his concentration is broken by sharp barking outside
They go to the tiny window and look out A DASHING MAN in
his early 30s climbs out of a vintage Porsche The dogs go
NUTS biting at his pant legs

BLANC
Let me guess

EXT THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
The man kicks off the dogs and limps toward the house
cursing Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner step out

onto the porch

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hugh Drysdale

RANSOM
Ransom Call me Ransom my middle
name The help call me Hugh

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Im Lieutenant Elliott this is
officer Wagner wed like to ask you
a few questions about the night of

RANSOM
Uh huh

He blows past them and into the house

INT LIVING ROOM
Walt Donna and Jacob (nose in his phone) sit around the
room Linda and Richard stand on their phones Ransom
breezes in bumping Donna who YELPS startled
Elliott and Wagner follow
TROOPER WAGNER
Sir excuse me we are officers of the
law
RANSOM
You gonna run me in I dont feel
like talking Im distraught

Ransom disappears into the kitchen comes out eating a
sleeve of pinwheel cookies

Blanc and Marta slip in Elliott nods to Blanc

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc anything you need to ask him

RANSOM
The hell anyway is this arrangement

BLANC
Mr Drysdale

Ransom sizes up Blanc with a grin

RANSOM
CSI KFC

Ransom grabs Fran the housekeepers sleeve as she walks by
RANSOM (contd)
Hey Frannie can you get me a glass of
cold milk

Meg and Joni have just entered and Meg heard this
MEG
Hey asshole Not her name not her

job

Fran walks off with a scorching look at Ransom

RANSOM
Meg Hows your SJW degree coming
MEG JONI
Trust fund prick Alright Guys

ALAN STEVENS the familys attorney knocks and enters with

an assistant SALLY who juggles several attache cases

ALAN
Hey everyone Hey Im just going
to set up in the other room be ready
in ten minutes

They go off to the library leaving the family all together

in tense silence

WALT
Funny Ransom you skipped the funeral
but youre early for the will
reading

JONI
Ok people grieve in different ways
lets not

WALT
(to Ransom)
Its funny youre here at all Why
are you even bothering thats what I
want to know

RICHARD
Whats that supposed to mean

WALT
He knows what it means

LINDA
Walt what

WALT
Jacob was in that bathroom the night
of the party

JONI
Is that where you were all night

RICHARD
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night

JACOB
Nothing
MEG
Swatting Syrian refugees
JACOB
No
MEG

Alt right troll

JACOB
Liberal snowflake

WALT
I dont know what any of that means

RICHARD
It means your sons a little creep

WALT
Oh MY sons a creep

JONI
Guys Walt he was in the bathroom

WALT
He was in the bathroom

RICHARD
Joylessly masturbating to pictures of
dead deer

WALT
Ok you wanna go

They go at each other and do some half-hearted slap-fighting
before Linda and Joni break them apart Ransoms loving
this

RANSOM
We gotta do this more often

LINDA
Alright Enough Jacob we get
where this is going The bathrooms
next to Harlans office where he had
the big fight with Ransom You heard
something Spill it

JACOB
I just heard two things

INT HALF BATH - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK

Jacob on the toilet hearing non distinct yelling through a
vent high in the wall But two words poke through

HARLAN (0S)
--my will

INT LIVING ROOM

JACOB
And then there was more shouting but
I also heard Ransom say Im warning

you
Walt raises his arms triumphant

LINDA
Ransom Whats this mean

He just eats cookies silent

WALT

It means dad finally came to his
senses and cut this worthless lazy
brat out of the will

(to Ransom)
And you better sell your little
Beamer and you better give your
notice at that country club and kick
whatever fashion drugs youre on
cause if you think after the bridges
youve burned the shit youve said
and what youve put this family
through for the past ten years that
any of us are going to support you
are going to give you like dad used
to say a single red dime youre nuts

Ransom looks around the room Cold faces

RICHARD
Son
RANSOM
(mock gravity)
Father
RICHARD

Did Harlan tell you he was cutting
you out of the will

RANSOM
Yes

RICHARD
Then hes done what we werent strong
enough to do - this might finally
make you grow up

Ransom is really slapped by this but he doesnt let it show

LINDA
I think it might be the best thing
that could happen to you

RANSOM
Thanks - my mother folks

JONI
It wont be easy for you but itll be
good Nothing good is ever easy

RANSOM MEG
Up your ass Joni youve got
your teeth bit into this Oh up your ass very nice
family tit so hard you homophobic privileged -
RANSOM

(going down the line)
As a matter of fact - Eat shit hows
that In fact eat shit eat shit -
eat shit - Definitely eat shit Eat
shit

And now everyone is shouting at each other

Blanc has heard enough He sets the baseball down on a side
table and drifts out Marta follows him

EXT FRONT PORCH

Blanc breathes in the air Marta joins him From inside
the house the shouting continues

MARTA
What was that about will readings
being boring

BLANC
Exception that proves the rule

Fran bursts out of the living room muttering

FRAN
Asshole

She storms off around the house A beat of thought Then

BLANC
Im warning you Ransom said Im
warning you

One of the dogs bounds up the steps to Blanc

MARTA
You heard Ransom in there its the
kind of thing he says

When Blanc goes to pet him the dog drops something to his
feet with a clatter Marta freezes

MARTA (contd)
Whats he got there Hey boy You
find a stick Hes always bringing
junk into the house -

Its the piece of broken trellis Blanc picks it up
examines it and suddenly his eyes go sharp
EXT THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD

Holding the piece up as he studies the trellis that runs up
the side of the house Marta runs up beside him

BLANC
This looks like a relatively fresh
break - yes Right there

Hes spotted the broken spot on the trellis Just up from
it what looks like a boarded window

BLANC (contd)
Wait - that doesnt make sense
wheres that window

INT LIVING ROOM

The whole family in a screaming match but Blanc and Marta
walk through and up the stairs Three people notice
Elliott and Wagner (who follow) and Ransom (who doesnt)

INT THIRD FLOOR LANDING

Blanc looks down the dead end hallway Marta joins him
out of breath

BLANC
Show me but dont step on the
carpet

Its a runner rug and Marta delicately steps on the wood
siding as she goes to the wall with the painting And swings
it open revealing the window

TROOPER WAGNER
Its the trick window From A Kill
For All Seasons

Elliott and Wagner at the top of the stairs and Blanc
motions them not to approach

BLANC
Off the carpet

He drops down to his knees removes a loupe from his jacket
and holds it in his eye Then his face inches from the
carpet he scans it All the way to the window Then
stops

BLANC (contd)
Traces of dried mud I suspect they
go the length of the hallway

MARTA
Footprints

BLANC
No just traces

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Depending on when it was last
cleaned it could be from anytime

BLANC
But that would not explain this

He motions to the base of the window sill - obvious scuffs
of dried mud Marta winces

Blanc tosses the piece of trellis to Elliott

BLANC (contd)

Analyze this mud It will match these
traces and you will find similar
samples leading up the trellis on the
side of the house

(beat)
On the night of the party somebody
who did not want to be heard climbing
the steps went to a great deal of
trouble to break into Harlan
Thrombeys rooms The game is afoot
eh Watson

INT LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER

The whole family assembled Marta stands in the back with
Blanc Elliott and Trooper Wagner

Alan Stevens Harlans attorney sits at a table with papers
in front of him assistant Sally beside him

ALAN
Well Thank you all for getting
together like this it isnt legally
necessary but I thought because
youre all in town and some of you
are leaving soon it would be best -

BLANC
Excuse me Mr Stevens As to that
ladies and gentlemen Id like to
gently request you all remain in town
until the investigation is completed
Shouldnt be more than two days

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hes gently requesting Im ordering
Nobody move until we figure this out

Nobody likes this

LINDA
What
JONI
Can we ask why Has something
changed

BLANC
No

JONI
No it hasnt changed or no we cant
ask

BLANC
Mr Stevens please continue

ALAN
Right Well the other reason I
thought this gathering would be uh
beneficial is that as I told Walt
Harlan altered his will one week ago
He sealed it and asked me not to
submit it to the courts for probate
until after his death So in case
theres any confusion about anything
were all together we can talk I
cant imagine any of it will be that
complicated Harlans assets included
um

SALLY
the house

ALAN
the house which he owned outright um

SALLY
sixty million

ALAN
right in various cash accounts and
investments yes and of course the
real assets are sole ownership of um

SALLY
Blood Like Wine

ALAN
Blood Like Wine publishing his
publishing company Ok

Walts wife puts her hand on his knee He squeezes
smiled tightly

it

ALAN (contd)

Um he did write up a statement when
he made the recent changes he wanted
it read first so

(reads )
Some of you may be surprised by the
choice Ive made here No pleasure
was taken in the exclusion and its
purpose was not to sow greater
discord in the family quite the
opposite Please accept it with
grace and without bitterness But do
accept it Its for the best

Gently condescending eyes shift to Ransom Linda sees this
puts her hand on her sons hand and he immediately gets up
and moves to a chair in the corner

Alans assistant hands him an envelope and he removes a
single sheet of paper with one short typed paragraph

ALAN (contd)
Ok So - oh wow yeah not complex
at all Thisll be quick I Harlan
Thrombey being of sound mind and
body yada yada my assets both
liquid and otherwise I leave in
their entirety to Marta Cabrera My
entire ownership of Blood Like Wine
publishing I leave in its entirety to
Marta Cabrera The copyright of its
catalog likewise I leave in its
entirety to Marta Cabrera

The air around Martas head goes away The room spins
Shes not sure whats happening Blanc is looking at her
The whole family is looking at her

Walt bursts out of his chair and grabs the will

WALT
No

LINDA
No

WALT

No What
(beat)
That cant be - that cant be right

RICHARD WALT
What the genuine shit That cant be right its
right
ALAN
Its right

Donna begins to hyperventilate She puts her head between
her knees breathes deep

LINDA
No no no no Alan this cant be legal
there are were his family

WALT RICHARD
Were his family Alan he
obviously wasnt
something - I dont know
what but something wasnt Are there safeguards against
right here this

And from the back of the room slowly rising above the din

of confusion and cursing slowly drawing even Martas deer

in the headlights attention Ransom LAUGHING Loud and
weirdly sincerely tears down his cheeks laughing his head
off

JONI
Alan theres a mistake
MEG JONI
Mom if its what granddad No this is a mistake this
wanted is ours
LINDA

Alan take that piece of paper and
shove it up your ass and get out
And you cops out

They dont but Ransom slips out his child-like laughter
trailing after him

RICHARD
Linda -

LINDA
No we need to talk and we need to
fight this thing and were not going
anywhere GET OUT Were the
Thrombeys goddammit This is still
our house
A beat of silence Then all eyes go to Alan Who looks
down at the will His assistant Sally points helpfully

ALAN
Sorry theres uh Likewise the
house at two Deerborn Drive and all
belongings therein I leave to Marta
Cabrera

Linda goes for Marta

LINDA
You little bitch Did you know about
this What did you do to him to make
this happen were you two what were
you boinking my father

Marta recoils stumbles back

MEG

Boinking
RICHARD

Linda

JACOB WALT
Anchor baby Marta Jacob And Linda -
please

JONI

Linda please - Marta you need to
tell us though

WALT JONI
Yes Marta did dad discuss You need to tell us
this with you everything you know about

this and we need to talk
about this

WALT RICHARD
This isnt what dad wanted Jesus dont mob the girl
this isnt fair but we can lets talk about this

work this out

The whole family is coming towards her like zombies Blanc

takes her by the arm and steers her towards the door

BLANC
I think heads have to cool a little
and in the meanwhile Id maybe run

EXT THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE

Marta stumbles out of the house in a daze Behind her the
entirety of the family floods out after her shouting
reassurances and questions and accusations and a general din
of confusion

MARTA
I - I have no idea why he - I just
need to think - Ill call you or have
him call me or do something I dont
know

She gets in her car and slams the door and its instantly
like A Hard Days Night - the family gathered around trying
to talk through the window and rapping to get her attention

Marta keys the ignition - chug chug chug Nothing Oh god
not now - chug chug chug It wont turn over

Richard opens the door she pulls it closed again and locks
it this is like a horror movie Blanc is trying to get the
family to back off but no dice

Marta puts her head in her hands all of it swirling and
echoing and horrifying she has no idea what to do

HONK

She turns - a honking car pulls up right beside her and
through the family crowd she sees Ransom in his Porsche
waving get in With no other options she pushes out of
her car and through the family and JUMPS IN with him

As he GUNS IT and careens out of the driveway he shouts back
at the family with a wave

RANSOM
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you

And theyre gone The family keeps shouting at each other
Blanc watches the Porsche recede his expression unreadable
DING His phone buzzing He checks it His expression
darkens

INT RANSOMS PORSCHE

Tearing down the private road away from the house Hes

still laughing shes still shell shocked Slowly his
laughter eases to a stop A moment of silence

RANSOM
Ok seriously though what the hell

She shakes her head looks at him What the hell indeed

EXT ROADSIDE FAMILY RESTAURANT - LATER

The Porsche parked out front

INT RESTAURANT - CORNER BOOTH

Tucked into a dark corner Marta is miserable Ransom is
bemused but regards her closely

They sit in silence A waitress sets a sausage plate down

RANSOM
(to the waitress)
Could we get an extra bowl please
(to Marta)
You look like youre gonna pass out
Have you eaten all day Eat

She joylessly shovels food in her mouth starving

MARTA
This is a nightmare

RANSOM
Uh huh So why

MARTA
Why

RANSOM

Why Hey this is everything There
has to be a bigger reason why and you
know it

MARTA
Well Ransom how about it had more to
do with you guys than with me

RANSOM
(agrees)
Yeah
(beat)
Yeah thats the only thing that makes
sense
Marta is unexpectedly effected by this The waitress
breezes by sets an empty bowl on the table

MARTA
Did he tell you anything

RANSOM
Just I wasnt getting a cent

MARTA RANSOM
He wanted you to build
something from the ground something from the ground
up like your parents up like my parents

RANSOM (contd)

yeah My mom built her business from
the ground up with a million dollar
loan from granddad My dad owns none
of it and mom made him sign a
prenup He lives in fear
I know thats what granddad wanted to
protect me from by doing this and I
know I shouldnt say this out loud
but when he told me Jesus Christ I
coulda killed him

(beat)
After I left the party though I
was driving fast nowhere just in
the night And I got this weird
clarity That from here on I was
going to have to do for myself And
that felt good The old bastard

(beat)
Marta I know three things One I
know he didnt commit suicide

MARTA
What makes you think that

RANSOM
I dont think it I know it Cause
I knew my granddad So youre not
going to bullshit me Because two
I know lying makes you puke Cause
of that mafia game last fourth of
July

Marta sinks back suddenly nervous

RANSOM (contd)
And three I know that you just ate
a full plate of sausage and baked
beans

She looks down at her empty plate Oh no He pushes the
large empty bowl in front of her

RANSOM (contd)
So look me in the eye And tell me
what really happened to my granddad

Her lip quivers She looks like she might attempt it But
then tears drop from her eyes

MARTA
You bastard

Ransom pull the bowl away and puts his hand on hers

RANSOM
Marta Tell me everything

EXT THROMBEY ESTATE - EVENING
Dusk settles heavy Warm light from the windows

WALT (0OS)
There have to be options here

ALAN (0S)
No I dont know how many times I
can repeat the same two simple pieces
of information

INT LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Lit by a fire in the fireplace the whole family pacing
around Alan the lawyer looking very tired seated at a table
in the center of the room

ALAN
If Harlan was of sound mind when he
made the changes and weve all
confirmed he was

RICHARD LINDA
Would a sound person do The very action speaks to
this Sound how unsoundness
ALAN

not legally no you not liking what
they did does not speak to
testamentary capacity
JACOB
What about undue influence

WALT
Yes Undue influence

ALAN
(weary )
Did you just google that

WALT
If Marta was manipulating dad
somehow if we found out that she had

LINDA WALT
Gotten her hooks into him Somehow or something

ALAN
You need a strong case for that
Youve got nothing She endeared
herself to him through hard work and
good humor wont cut the salami

JONI
What about the slayer rule

All eyes turn to her Her face is lit by her phone

JONI (contd)
I did just google that

ALAN
The slayer rule obviously does not
apply here

RICHARD

What the hell is the slayer rule

JONI
Its if someone is convicted of
killing the person they cant get
their inheritance

ALAN
Not even convicted even if theyre
held responsible for their death in
civil court

WALT ALAN
Like OJ Like OJ yes But Harlan
committed suicide

All eyes turn to Blanc who this whole time has been sitting
in a chair by the fire lost in thought

JONI
Detective Blank You said that the
investigation is continuing You
made a point of that Do you suspect

foul play
BLANC
Mister Blanc If you please
(beat)

There is much that remains unclear
But yes I suspect foul play

The eruption you would expect breaks out

RICHARD
Marta

BLANC
I have eliminated no suspects

RICHARD
Youre full of shit I dont trust
this guy in the tweed suit and Alan
god bless you youre useless

ALAN
Thank you

Alan takes that as an excuse to leave
RICHARD

Theres one answer to this she can
renounce the inheritance

WALT LINDA
She knows its what she
should do its the right Weve gotta make her do the
thing to do right thing

Meg rounds on her mom speaks quietly in tears

MEG
Mom If Granddad wanted Marta to
have everything thats what he
wanted

JONI
No this was not him He loved us
he wanted us taken care of He
wanted you to have an education
(MORE )

JONI (contd)
Meg You think I can pay for your
school

This leaves Meg shaken

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Beer bottles now stacked up in front of Ransom Marta has
just told Ransom everything He stares into space and
makes the slightest hint of a laugh which Ill write as

RANSOM
Heuh

MARTA
I know just saying it it sounds
insane but its all true I think

Blancs been on to me from the
start - I dont care if I go to jail
but my mom my sister we cant -

Nothing but silence from Ransom Maybe hes deep in
thought A strange glint in his eye

MARTA (contd)
You going to say something

RANSOM
I always thought I was the only one
who could beat Granddad at GO I
always thought that meant something

MARTA
I know you did

RANSOM
At the party that night my last
conversation with him our last
fight thats what he told me about
you That you beat him nearly every
time More than me And I thought
what a strange thing to tell me But
I think I get it now I think it did
mean something

(beat)

Im not telling the family shit
Youre not going to jail That
detective is not going to catch you
And youre not giving up the family
fortune

(MORE )

RANSOM (contd)
Think about what Granddad did to see
this through this was what he wanted
not just for you but for his family
and for him And yes for you
Youve come this far Let me help you
go all the way

Marta looks at him hard

MARTA
This isnt you You could turn me in
right now and get your cut of the
inheritance Why

RANSOM
Because fuck my family They dont
deserve any of this I can help you
and we can fool them all and get away
with it and then you will give me
my cut of the inheritance The
perfect ending we all win You me
and Harlan Deal

Silence Broken by Martas phone ringing On the phone

MARTA (ON PHONE)
And once I get the -

Meg hangs up lets the phone drop from her ear Tears in
her eyes She turns to her whole family gathered behind
her silent and expectant

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Marta realizes the connections dead holds the phone in her
hand like something delicate she just broke

RANSOM
Ok then Did the detective find
anything suspicious at the house

INT MARTAS BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

She wakes to a sharp rapping at her door Her sister Alice
pokes her head in flustered

ALICE
Marta get your ass up what the hell
is happening Theres a guy here and
a bunch of stuff everythings going
crazy are we rich

Marta lifts her head from her hands

MARTA
Maybe I dunno

ALICE
I dont even know what that means but

Marta looks at her phone - 28 missed calls

INT CABRERA LIVING ROOM
Marta stumbles in - Alice in front of the TV mom pacing

MOM
(subtitled Spanish)
Oh my god Marta what is all this
what did you do

The TV is tuned to local news - an anchor stands outside
THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING

LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
Â»-we again we dont know much about
Marta Cabrera or the exact
relationship she had to Harlan
Thrombey beyond being his home
nurse and the Thrombey family has
yet to release a statement

MARTA
Is that here

ALICE
Oh yeah it is Wait so is that true
Are we rich

Marta looks out the blinds - several local reporters down in
the streets with their vans and cameras

MARTA
Oh my god
EXT THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - DAY

Wagners prowler pulls up Blanc gets out of the passenger
side

Blanc nods to the Wagner and the officer

INT GREATNANAS ROOM

Dim By an open window stands GREATNANA Blanc enters she
turns They look into each others eyes

BLANC
Good Morning Mrs Thrombey

A long pause as he thinks of exactly the right word

BLANC (contd)
Why is grief the providence of youth
I dont know But Id imagine that
age deepens all feelings Including
grief This was a long walk to
offering condolences for the loss of
your son And asking you if it isnt
presumptuous of me to not think too
harshly of your family if I am as I
suspect the first to console you
Theyre young arent they

Blanc sits

BLANC (contd)
One thing I do assume of age is
weariness Damned if I dont get
more tired every day Tired of what
I do Following arcs like lobbed
rocks The inevitability of truth
But the complexity and the gray lies
not in the truth but what you do with
the truth once you have it

Greatnanas eyes move slightly

BLANC (contd)
I think you have something you want
to tell me I think youre very
perceptive and very capable of
telling me what you saw the night of
your sons party But Ill happily

wait Im in no rush I find it
quite pleasant Sitting here with
you

He reclines not particularly looking at her She looks
back at him Every now and then a breeze stirs the window
sheers

INT CABRERA LIVING ROOM

MOM
Lawyers were here very big lawyers
it looked like and some other guys I
didnt know they left all this for
you and business cards so many

of other stuff when I got home -

envelopes into Martas arms

INT APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY

Dim and dingy Marta comes out of their apartment door
then jump startled - at the end of the hall lurking
Walt

MARTA
Hey

Walts eyes are rimmed red His heavy cane taps

WALT
Hey

Theyre not sure what to do so they awkwardly hug Marta

WALT (contd)
How you doing

MARTA WALT
Well Walt I want you to
know I didnt know about any
of this This is I know you didnt we all
went kinda crazy yesterday

MARTA
Understandable
WALT
Youre still very important to all of
us I want you to know that

MARTA
I havent even looked at all this
yet this legal stuff is this from
you guys

Marta flips through the envelopes squinting

WALT
it isnt from us Maybe just local
lawyers and accountants who saw the
news and want to jump on it Id be
careful of it all

One envelope sticks out - a blank plain letter sized
envelope no postage no return address

WALT (contd)
Marta Is it your intention to
renounce the inheritance

MARTA
This is what Harlan wanted

WALT
Well Harlan has put you in a very
hard position here It was unfair of

him
Walts hand on his cane Gripping tight

WALT (contd)
You see what this kicks up with the
press and the scrutiny and we
know with your mother

MARTA
-with my mother

Martas spine straightens

MARTA (contd)
What did Meg tell you

WALT
This isnt about who - youre missing
the point were not attacking you
with this

(MORE )

WALT (contd)
Marta if your mom came here
illegally criminally if you come
into this inheritance with the
scrutiny that entails Id be afraid
that could come to light Thats
what were all trying to avoid here
We can protect you from that
happening or if it happens

MARTA
Youre saying even if it came to
light with the familys resources
you could help me fix it

WALT
Yes The right lawyers none of
those local guys but New York
lawyers DC lawyers enough resources
put towards it yes But theres no
need it should ever even come up

But yes
MARTA
Ok Good
WALT
Ok
MARTA
Cause Harlan gave me all your
resources So that means with my

resources Ill be able to fix it So
I guess Im going to go find the
right lawyers

WALT
Marta

He shuffles towards her For the first time she feels a
hint of physical threat and backs up quick into her
apartment

WALT (contd)
You better be sure you want to -

She slams the door

focused She dumps the legal envelopes in the trash but
keeps the mysterious envelope opens it and pulls out

Half a sheet of paper roughly torn A photocopy of the
header of some sort of medical document OFFICE OF THE
CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER Under that a photocopy of a tag
with her name on it And hand written in block letters at

the mysterious letter in her hands

INT RANSOMS LIVING ROOM

Ransom studies the mysterious letter Marta pushes aside a
stack of New Yorkers and sits on the couch

RANSOM
Well I dont know what this is from

Indicating the tag photocopy with her name

MARTA
Its my medical bag tag They have
my medical bag For some reason

RANSOM
OK but this is just a photocopy of
the header of a blood toxicology
report from the local crime lab On
Harlan Marta it would show the
morphine overdose

MARTA
So Im screwed How do you know all
this stuff

RANSOM
I was Harlans research assistant
For a summer

He sips his morning coffee

RANSOM (contd)
But what kind of blackmail scheme is
this I mean the actual evidence is
sitting up the street at the crime
lab What was the point of sending
you this

EXT NORFOLK ROADS

Siren blazing the cop car SPEEDS into town

EXT MEDICAL EXAMINERS OFFICE

The cop car pulls past an identifying sign into the parking
lot of a one story stand alone building joining several
other cop cars and fire trucks Journalists kept at bay

The building is a charred brick husk Black smoke debris
Its been gutted with an explosion and a blazing fire

Blanc steps out of the cop car and finds Lieutenant Elliott

BLANC
Whats the cheese

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Five AM security systems here was
all triggered It went up quick
Blood stores records all gone No
employees around thank god

BLANC
Any surveillance cams

Elliott gestures wearily to the charred remains of a
security camera on the smoking shell of an awning

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And speaking of security the
security tape from the Thrombey
residence was scrambled For some
reason
Blanc unsurprised He motions back to the building

Across the street Marta and Ransom pull up in her car

MARTA
Holy shit This is insane

Ransom looks at her - yeah its likely They both
instinctively duck down in case the cops look over

MARTA (contd)
Who would blow up a whole real
official building just to blackmail
me

RANSOM
Marta this means that the blackmailer
has the only paper copy of the thing
that can prove your guilt You didnt
get any other instructions no phone
call no email no nothing

Marta looks stunned She stabs at her phone quick swipes

MARTA
Â»-nothingI didnt check my email

She shows him an email from 092832shushmailcom No

Blanc begins to walk straight towards Marta Quickly and
with purpose Shouts something Lieutenant Elliott follows

paces from the car Closing in fast

streets down narrow alleys using her small car to nimbly
dart though small spaces

She pulls to a stop in a secluded little back lot

Elliott leads Ransom off by the elbow Ransom throws a look
back at Marta - he has no idea whats going on

MARTA
Whats going on

BLANC (contd)
Did he ask you to drive when he saw
me coming

Ransoms being led to the police car Marta decides

Yes

Marta gets back in her car She pretends to take a sip from
an empty soda cup but actually SPITS UP a little into it

adjusting from the sun

Hello

Her foot hits something on the dirty concrete floor

She kneels picks it up gently

Next to where it was lying she finds something else
curious - the burned remnants of a piece of paper Only a
charred corner remains

She turns her attention back to the room Creeps forward

MARTA (contd)
Hello

Ahead - a silhouette A person Seated in a chair in the
center of the room Silent facing her

MARTA (contd)
Listen I dont know what you want
Whatever you want we can work it out
but we have to figure it out right
here right now and Im leaving with
that report
A beat of silence Nothing Somethings not right here

MARTA (contd)
Hello

Marta takes a step closer lifts her phone and turns on its
flashlight

Illuminating the ghostly face of FRAN the housekeeper
Marta barely breathing

MARTA (contd)
Fran

A SPIDER crawls across Frans face Marta STIFLES A SCREAM
and leaps back sucking in air

A moment of stillness Her phone BUZZES - Blanc calling
Marta ignores the call frozen

Her eyes go to A white letter sized ENVELOPE in Frans
hand resting on her lap

Marta swallows Leans in carefully and quietly for some
reason and SLIPS the envelope from the lifeless fingers

Unsealed She opens it

It is empty

Before this can even sink in a rattling grating DRAW OF
BREATH - from Fran

Marta starts - oh my god - and goes to her checking a
pulse checking her eyes lays her on her back Fran sucks
in thin breath her eyes finding Marta in the glare of the
dropped phone flashlight

MARTA (contd)
Fran Fran Can you hear me Fran
give me a sign if you can hear me

FRAN
You

MARTA
Me Fran its Marta you called me
here you sent me the email Im
here Im going to call an ambulance
and youre going to be ok but can you
tell me what happened did you take

Weak Fran grabs Martas wrist and Marta focuses on her

FRAN
COpy copy

MARTA
What

FRAN
-Stashed

These words are barely given breath
FRAN (contd)
you did this wont get
away with this

Her eyes seize Her breath gets ragged Marta is paralyzed
with shock and fear Fran is dying

Marta looks at the medical bag in her hand Then at Fran
struggling with her final breaths eyes wide with fear

She takes a step back from the dying Fran Fingers tight
around the medical bag Letting her die

But then a decision no Marta dials 911 on speaker drops
to her knees and starts administering mouth to mouth

PHONE

MARTA

But why did Fran take my morphine
Obviously she had swiped my bag from

user to me unless thats why she
needed money

(beat)
I dunno doesnt matter I should
tell the Thrombeys myself I feel
like I owe that to them

BLANC
I dont think thats a good idea

MARTA
No I need to do it I wont do any
of this if I cant do that I really
need to I gave the doctors my
number theyll call if anything
changes with Fran

Im sorry Im so sorry I told them
about your mom I was angry and
scared Im sorry

Meg sniffs dries her eyes

MEG

after this

They hug one more time Then when Meg walks off towards the

I know where the tox report is

Marta jimmies the clock drawer open with a letter opener

She pulls a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER from inside blows loose
pot leaves off it She hands it to Blanc

Anyway thisll tie everything up
And I just handed it to you god
youre youre not much of a
detective are you

To be fair youre a pretty lousy
murderer Perhaps we deserve each
other

INT LIVING ROOM

The family gathered impatient Lieutenant Elliott and
Trooper Wagner are there too with another uniformed
officer Ransom sits in the corner his face passive

Marta gulps Blanc is a few steps behind her As she
speaks he unfolds and reads the tox report

MARTA
Um You guys have always been good
to me And what Im about to say
isnt going to be easy and youre
going to be upset but especially
after everything youve gone through
the past few days I thought you
deserved to hear it from me

Walt smiles at her youre doing the right thing Marta
takes a deep breath

Blanc has finished reading the report He refolds it
carefully

MARTA (contd)

BLANC

Excuse me You have not been good to
her You have all treated her like
shit to steal back a fortune that you
lost and she deserves Youre a pack
of bloody vultures at the feast but
youre not getting bailed out not
this time

Ms Cabrera has decided definitively
not to renounce the inheritance

What

MARTA
What

BLANC

Furthermore it will be my
professional recommendation to the
local authorities that the manner of
death in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide and the case is

closed

MARTA BLANC
What No Blanc - Thank you all for coming
goodbye

He firmly guides Marta out by the elbow A beat of silence

RICHARD
Is anybody else confused

As the family breaks out in hubub Linda notices her dads
OLD BASEBALL on the side table where Blanc left it Whats
that doing here She picks it up

Blanc steers Marta into the library as sounds of hubub and
shouting come from the other room

MARTA
What the hell I want to come clean
this is over -

BLANC
Almost

Elliott bursts in motions to the living room then Marta
then Blanc

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What - with - what

BLANC
Im sorry - officer Wagner

Wagner enters

BLANC (contd)
Please keep the family out of this
room and get them out of the house if
you can But stand by with your
additional officer

TROOPER WAGNER
Get the family out

BLANC
Yes but not all of them

Blanc whispers something to Wagner who nods and exits

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc cmon whats all this Drama

BLANC
Indulge me

Marta sits Elliott remains standing

MARTA
Blanc I told Ransom Ransom told
you Im telling you now - it is an
immovable fact that I killed Harlan

BLANC
Yes you did yes he did yes you are
but But

(MORE )
BLANC (contd)
I spoke in the car about the hole at
the center of this donut And yes
what you and Harlan did that fateful
night seems at first glance to fill
that hole perfectly A donut hole in
the donuts hole But we must look a
little closer And when we do we
see that the donut hole has a hole in
its center - it is not a donut hole
at all but a smaller donut with its
own hole and our donut is not whole
at all

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc I understand that this is
amusing for you -

BLANC
Why Was I Hired Why would
someone hire me

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Someone fishing for any crime that
could help reverse the will

BLANC

I was hired before the sealed will
was read Yes the person must have
known the contents of the will But
one step further - that same person
must have known a crime was
committed and further if the intent
was to reverse Martas inheritance
they must have known that Marta was
responsible

(beat)
An intriguing combination of factors
Someone who knew what Marta did
wanted to expose it but could not
reveal how they knew

MARTA
Fran She was blackmailing me she
knew what I did

BLANC
But Fran wanted money ergo she did
not want the crime exposed

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Did someone in the family see Marta
doing something suspicious

BLANC
They would have had no reason to not
speak up No The answer is not so
simple

Blanc sits suddenly weary

BLANC (contd)

Now with the entire solution in my
field of view the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors And Marta
it will not be easy to hear But
there is at least one truly guilty
party behind it all guilty in the
true sense of acting with malice and
committing a heinous crime with
selfish intent

(calls)
Trooper Wagner

MARTA
(stunned)
Trooper Wagner

Blanc squints at her No

A moment later Wagner leads Ransom in Ransom looks at
Marta softly sadly

RANSOM
Marta Im sorry I told them
everything I figured it was all up
Im sorry

MARTA
Its alright Ransom Im glad you
did

BLANC

Not exactly everything though

MARTA
Is this about what Greatnana told
you She saw me that night she
mistook me for Ransom

BLANC
Well get to that But first Mr
Hugh Ransom Drysdale you might tell
us all why you hired me

RANSOM
Why I hired you
BLANC
Youre right lets back up To the
night of the party Your argument
with Harlan What were the overheard
words by the Nazi child masturbating
in the bathroom - my will and Im
warning you You and Harlan were
drama mamas you shared a love of
twisting the knife into one another
I dont believe he would have slipped
it in halfway - no I submit that
Harlan told you everything

BLANC
Marta remind me what Ransom said his
conversation with Harlan ended with

MARTA
Harlan told him that I could beat him
in GO

BLANC
And I asked myself - Marta Why
would the topic of the will have
steered around to Marta There is
one obvious explanation

INT SMALL STUDY - NIGHT OF PARTY

You are not this crazy You would
not just throw your fortune away

in my life and Ive done it Harlan I -

Ive made the change to my
will its done

RANSOM (contd)
Im warning you

Push into a vent in the wall

RANSOM
That is some heavy duty conjecture

BLANC
Granted But its the only way what
comes next makes sense So you storm
out you drive off into the night
You tell Marta later of what was it
feeling an overwhelming sense of

MARTA
Clarity That he has to make do for
himself from here on out

Exactly

alone and undetected

Ransom disappears into the darkened doorway

BLANC (VO) (contd)
You knew the medications Harlan took
You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night

And you knew if Marta was responsible
for his death even unintentionally
the slayer rule would nullify the
changed will and you would get your
share back

unwrapped two syringes and has the two vials out - the
Toradol and the morphine (the good stuff)

Using the syringes he extracts the liquid from both vials
and then injects the liquids back into the opposite vials
He SWITCHES THE MEDICATIONS

BLANC (VO)
You use the syringes in the kit to
switch the liquids in the two
medication vials And as a final
precaution you take the Naloxone
the life saving antidote

Replacing the vials he takes an injection pen closes the
bag up and leaves

No no thats impossible

BLANC
It is the truth Hand me that vial
of morphine Ill show you

Blanc has placed two identical vials on the table behind
Marta Her mind is still spinning she glances at them
takes one and absently hands it to him

MARTA
If he did that if the meds were
switched then when I got them mixed
up
(oh my god)

idea how

MARTA
She has a cousin - she told me she
has a cousin who works as a
receptionist at the examiners office

BLANC
Well voila The numbers mean nothing
to her but if Ransom is guilty its
existence is a threat so she
photocopies the header and makes her
blackmail note

MARTA
So why did she send it to me

BLANC
She did not She sent it to Ransom

In one fluid motion he spins to the ornamental WALL OF
KNIVES grabs one -

BLANC

and TACKLES MARTA

Time slows as Blanc and Elliott lunge to stop him but its
too late -

Ransom and Marta fall together his arm arcing down
And as the they hit the ground his arm comes down
PLUNGING THE KNIFE UP TO THE HILT IN HER CHEST

They lie still breathing hard Her eyes wide with pain and
horror His cold and wild

But then she blinks Squints
And he cocks his head Realizing something
Withdraws the knife from her chest

Its fake blade had retracted into the handle Itsa
theatrical prop

He pumps it up and down a few times the spring making a
pathetic toy noise

Ransom smirks

RANSOM
Shit

And is VIOLENTLY TACKLED out of frame by Trooper Wagner

alright Elliott and Wagner wrestling Ransom into cuffs it

front of me

Taps her shoe The tiny faded spot of blood

I want you to remember something very
important you won not by playing
the game Harlans way but yours

Through the window she sees the family outside
