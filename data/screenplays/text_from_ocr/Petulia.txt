1 ALLEY LOADING PLATFORM AND CORRIDOR OF FAIRMONT HOTEL

NIGHT

The story begins in this grubby alley where two extra
large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading
platform Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to

see how many people died nobody died the backdoors

of the ambulances are opened by attendants and six
perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile
accidents are lifted into wheelchairs

The cripples are beautifully dressed the men in tuxedos
the women in splendid evening dresses One of the women
wears a neck brace which forces her always to look
skyward so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage
pinned to her bosom

Quickly attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the
stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform
past great bales of laundry past whatever horrors one
finds behind the warm smiling face of a hotel Watch-
men pastry cooks valets are watching the rush of the
wheelchairs without much interest

Then doors swing open and we are in the tram It of the
grand ballroom

2 INTO GRAND BALLROOM

It is a charity ball The sign says Shake for Highway
Safety The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer
interest us They are the guests of honor and people
gather about them to arrange them appealingly and we
rush past the go-go band the shakers and the door
prize which is a little convertible spinning endlessly
on a pedestal

CAMERA reaches PETULIA who is dancing with her husband
DAVID but trying not to lose sight of ARCHIE ARCHIE
really wants to leave but he is too polite to make it
too obvious As he bends over to put his punch cup on

a table he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the

guests of honor He is not at all comfortable

E

Its not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie
gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies
get in the way and the dance wont end The music
stops for a second everyone sags and thinks Thank
God its over but instantly the music begins again
and everyone good naturedly swears Those crazy kids
are trying to kill us and meanwhile Petulia sees
that Archie has reached the place where you get your
coat

MED ARCHIE

He is searching through his pockets for the ticket
that will let him reclaim his coat All the coats

are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical
care of a debutante attendant

PETULIA S VOICE
You cant leave
He turns and sees Petulia

PETULIA

Youre an official host

She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with
Official Host says Dr A Bollen Archie takes the
ribbon off as though to pin it on Petulia

PETULIA
Careful Can you tell Im not wearing
a brassiere

ARCHIE
No

PETULIA
Dont think about it It will only

excite you

Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat which the
attendant now tries to find On through this Petulia
continues

L

PETULIA
Thats my husband over there

ARCHIE
Ahh

PETULIA
Ive been married six months and Ive
never had an affair

ARCHIE
It can happen

PETULIA

Dont take it so bloody well Ive just
turned you down Hes looking at us

My husband

MED DAVID WITH HIS MOTHER AND FATHER

somewhere near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod
which of course they dont have

The father is watching the charity affair with utter
disapproval He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen
raffle tickets into the waiters jacket pocket

MR DANNER
I hope you win the car sir

Mrs Danner is charmed by her husbands generosity
She simply adores the man David is busy not watching
Archie and Petulia

PETULIAS VOICE
Isnt he gorgeous Hes a naval architect
It really zings when you say it My
husband David is a naval architect
Actually were starving You wouldnt
want to buy a sixty foot sloop Davids
Momma and Poppa keep us Look how
disgusted Poppa is He hates this sort

of thing

L

ARCHIEIS VOICE
Poppa is too sensitive

PETULIAS VOICE

Sensitive my ass Hes bored Highway

Give him something he can sink his teeth
into - Rheumatoid Arthritis A® Muscular
Dystrophy -m and hes the best there is
A real pro A little lame girl with a
ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her
arm and Poppa can set the world on fire
Hes really slumming tonight

BARNEYS VOICE

Ae¢
WILMA

ARCHIE

(SHRUGGING)

Barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his Vicuna
coat which the debutante is smothering under other
coats as she finally finds Archies

W ILMA

ARCHIE
Ex-wife G night

steps toward her She whirls around to face the departing
Archie

PETULIA
Archie

She shakes her head thoughtfully During all this the door-
man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as
they keep changing their mind

PETULIA
It feels so super Suddenly all that love

3 EXT BUS TERMINAL

All we see is the wheel of a car resting on the back
of a small boy pinning him to the ground and people
shocked not knowing what to do

ARCHIES VOICE
Well stay then

L PETULIAS IMAGE ENDS AND WE ARE BACK IN THE GRAND BALLROOM

PETULIA

Archie why do you play this dumb game

beautiful lady Youre bloody lucky Im

ARCHIE
Six

PETULIA
Gnight

ARCHIE

PETULIA
Meet you outside

5 EXT DREAM MOTEL NIGHT

A motel sign Dream Motel A concrete oval spiral-
ling up four floors You drive to your room and everything
is geared to get you to bed electronically But you must
have a car and Petulia and Archie have come by cab
Archie is paying the cabbie

PETULIA

(to cabbie)

You mustnt take it personal

(she indicates the No Cabs sign)
Lucky we dont have luggage
ARCHIE
Does this trouble you

PETULIA
A little

ARCHIE
I suggested my place

PETULIA

Id always imagined a tourist cabin with
paper thin walls the sounds of a man from
Tennessee in the cabin next door sobbing
endlessly M4ude Maude Maude 8 8

Archie sees a car moving through the processes of

E registration Grabbing Petulias hand he starts to
what is presumably the entrance -- at least it is the
bottom of the ramp They arrive at the booth and
Archie steps on the place marked Stand Here A
TV screen lights up

MAN ON TV

Evenin Wheres your auto

Archie nods for Petulia to see the TV camera which
is scanning them

PETU LIA

Lost in a hailstorm this side of Pocatello
Idaho Those hailstones really came down
didnt they Zeke

MAN ON TV
No auto

ARCHIE
No auto

MAN ON TV
Its a problem

ARCHIE
Only if we make it one

PETULIA
Do you have any slides or swings for children

MAN ON TV
No matam You got kids

PETULIA
No no I was told to be suspicious of
motels which cater to the family trade

MAN ON TV
This isnt that sort of place No auto

WELL

There is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which
normally would fasten to the side of the car On it is
an electronic register an electronic pen and a key with
a great metal tag (as an example of how this might be
designed I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los
Angeles) As Archie registers and puts the ten dollar
bill where it belongs Petulia looks at the TV set

E

s
s Continued

PETULIA
Youve got a very nice TV face

MAN ON TV
Thank you ma amp

PETULIA
You have to use pancake make-up things
like that

MAN ON TV

(a slight giggle)

No just be natural

Archie has finished registering and takes the keys

MAN ON TV

Weve got an elevator but its just for going
out for the paper and the like I mean when

you dont want to take the car Youll have

to use the ramp because of the key It lets

you know when you get to your room

INT RAMP

Archie and Petulia start up ramp
Its a long dark run and they are soon winded

ARCHIE

(GASPING)
CHARMING

PETULIA

(GASPING)

It shouldnt be charming Youre missing
the whole point It should be menacing
Another couple in a proper car rushes by There is
a blaze of headlights and a rush of sound
PETULIA

»-gray terribly distraught

headlights of passing cars lighting up our
room

Archie tugs at her and gasps

PETULIA

(CONTINUING)

a police car careening down the highway
sirens going full blast And I plunge
madly into your arms
But she is now totally winded and cannot say another
word Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena a tiny
light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off
furiously Just ahead of him is the door of their motel
room Archie is aghast at the pulsating key

ARCHIE

(PLAINTIVELY)
My apartments only four blocks from

HERE
7 INT DREAM MOTEL ROOM

Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do A
control panel takes care of the drapes TV stereo
announcements from the office etc etc etc There
are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia

does is establish contact between the vanity mirror

the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet
mirror so that she is reflected endlessly

PETULIA

You have 624 women in this room and

Im still counting

Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top
buttons on the back of her dress

PETULIA

(HARSHLY)

Just wait a minute okay

Archie plops on the bed in his coat a most iropic smile
on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not
going to get laid Petulia is examining all the Petulia
faces in the mirrors

PETULIA

My great-grandmother is ninety-one and

still has a granite chin

Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to
vibrate Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on
endless beds

PETULIA
What a lecherous lot

ARCHIE
Shes ninety-ones eh

PETULIA
But no fun

ARCHIE
Not at ninety-one hell

PETULIA

She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her
husband was killed in the first war ina

trench looking just like Cary Grant with a

waxed moustache She cant remember him but

she does remember Cary Grant because he is

from Bristol too and often in the news If

his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed
moustache whether he likes it or not

She turns to face Archie She is afraid and she is
angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one
moment to the next But she knows he shouldnt be in an
overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed

Aee
PETULIA

Stop being so damn casual
Archie sits up but is still casual

PETULIA
Were about igtd become lovers Did you bring
an instrument Archie

ARCHIE
Eh

PETULIA
Ring for room service Ask the robot for
something splendid and musical

ARCHIE
Saxophone Electric Organ Tuba

PETULIA

A tuba Absolutely Bless you Ar--hie A
tuba Something large and twirly and pom
to pom pomX Archie this is an event We
0 are about to become lovers

ARCHIE
You said that

PETULIA
It cant be said often enough

ARCHIE
Are we

PETULIA
Are we what

ARCHIE
About to become lovers

PETULIA
No

ARCHIE
Ah you swinging young marrieds
He leaves

8 EXT ROOM

Across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on
TV mentioned Archie is already there waiting for it
to arrive Petulia starts toward him angrily
PETULIA

Where do you have to rush If we were making

love you would be exploring my navel about now

Time would be the last thing on your mind

An old man in a bathrobe sadly out of contrast with

the electronic motel looks up from the open trunk of
his car The elevator doors open Petulia and Archie

enter

9 INT ELEVATOR

The elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a
loud speaker begins playing a medley of San Francisco
songs

PETULIA

You look like a gargoyle Poor dumb Archie
Im all mixed up sexually Old Mums a
prostitute The oldest professional lady in

0 all Bristol Mavis too my sister But

I mean shes not a landmark yet

During this Archie notices that the back of Petulias
dress remains unbuttoned He moves behind her and
begins rebuttoning her At the touch of his hand
something happens to Petulia

10 INT FIRST AID ROOM

Archies hands are holding a little boy under the bright
lights of a first aid table The boy is a bloody mess but
Archies hands are soothing him even as they so gently
prod examining his injuries Nurses are cutting the boys
bloody jeans off him an expensive watch falls to the
floor they retrieve it

11 INT ELEVATOR

Petulias head presses against Archies hand She

kisses it she rubs her cheek against it

The elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened
Archie sees Petulias tears on his hand
ARCHIE
Real honest-to-God tears Petulia

PETULIA
Tears Archie

ARCHIE
Petulia youre a kook
He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab

12 EXT DREAM MOTEL

Archie crosses to the cab and opens the door He hustles
Petulia inside the cab

ARCHIE
If he gets you there in time you can still
pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy

PETULIA

(very quietly)

Archie Im going to marry you

The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him
through the rear window Archie allows himself the
drollest of smiles

ARCHIE
Its the Pepsi generation
0 He walks into the night alone

E 12 Continued

A jalopy full of dizzy dames with LOVE painted in
huge awkward letters on its side almost runs him
down Archie continues in the night

Now we can see the Golden Gate Bridge

13 EXT DANNER HOUSE DAWN
The house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises

behind it Petulia is going up the open lift which
climbs the cliff It is a very different Petulia
She hurts
INT ARCHIES BEDROOM MORNING

Archie is sleeping There is the SOUND of a bell
ringing After awhile Archies hand reaches out for
the phone

ARCHIE

(into phone)

Im up thanks

Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing
and is constant He sees the alarm clock 61 He
stumbles and staggers to the front door

ARCHIE

Yeah yeah 000 yeah 000

He opens the door to come face to face with the large
and twirly front end of a tuba The tuba is stark
white for no particular reason

14A EXT ARCHIES APARTMENT

We see some of the hall a yawning milkman etc but
mostly Petulia and the tuba

14B INT ARCHIES APARTMENT

Dazedly Archie steps back to make room for Petulia
and the tuba

ARC HIE

Ill make some coffee

Petulia blows with all her strength emitting a sad
little peep then collapses to the floor tuba and all

14B Continued

PETULIA
Arent I a kook If you think youre

SURPRISED
ARCHIE

(at the same time)

No Ive been up for hours waiting for
the doorbell to ring

PETULIA

O think how surprised the-man who owns
the pawnshop is going to be when he sees
all that broken glass

14C EXT PAWN SHOP

A brick smashes the glass scattering cameras mandolins
etc in the midst of which is the white tuba

PETULIAS VOICE
Archie how come the burglar alarm didnt
go off

14D INT ARCHIES APT
0 The scene continues

PETULIA

Wherets it all going to end if the
burglar alarms wont go off Take me
to bed Archie

ARCHIE

Get the hell out of here please

He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches
her waist to lift her she screams and faints

15 INT HALLWAY OF DANNER HOUSE NIGHT

But we dont know its the Danner house All we see is
Petulia crumpling as she is struck She hits the floor
and just lies there not making a sound

(Also SHOOT in slow motion)

16 INT ARCHIE S APARTMENT
Archie breaks an ammonia ampule under Petulias nose

Her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes Archie
has begun to prod her side she is in pain

PETULIA
Ive got a broken rib I think I can
feel it broken Archie

ARCHIE
Dont you know you can puncture a lunge

PETULIA

Hopping around with tubas and stuff --
isntt it kooky though

Archie has begun to remove her dress

PETULIA
When are we going to stop trying to
undress me

ARCHIE
Shut up

PETULIA
Leave me alone Archie
Archie sees she really means it

ARCHIE

Its just a rib to me

PETULIA
Thats why Call a proper doctor

ARCHIE
What do you think I am

PETULIA
A hairy legged old lecher running around
in pajama bottoms

ARCHIE
Get your clothes off

PETULIA

As a woman not as a rib

Archie is harassed The phone begins ringing He
it angrily

grabs
ARCHIE

(into phone)

Im awake Im awake How many times

are you gonna callI

He hangs up then realizes this was the first wake up call

E ARCHIE

(to Petulia)

You know what a- youll drive me cuckoo

He sighs and begins dialing a number Petulia is in real
pain Like alittle child she crawls under the covers of
his bed pulling the quilt up around her as though Archies
left over warmth will make the pain go away

ARCHIE

(into phone)

Barney Archie Fine fine fine

Now At my place My apartment Barney
its very complicated and I havent had

my morning coffee yet Her name is Petulia

Petulia Barney shut up I have to get

to the hospital

16A BARNEYS BEDROOM MORNING
During the above we catch a glimpse of sleepy Barney
sleepily asking stupid questions

16B INT ARCHIES APARTMENT

Archie hangs up goes to a medicine case which he had
hastily opened for the ammonia ampule and now he takes out
a couple of pills which he gives to Petulia She takes
them obediently

PETULIA

Youve got a super build for a man your age

Archie says nothing He crosses to the bathroom and
hastily begins dressing
PETULIA
Where are all the family pictures
Archie is busy brushing his teeth

PETULIA

(LOUDLY)
The family pictures
He looks out from the bathroom blankly

PETULIA
Polo and the boys

Ae¢
Archie goes back to brushing his teeth electrically with
salt

16B Continued

a€¢ PETULIA

Ill bet you named her Polo Dont ever

start mucking about with Petulia

Archie exits from the bathroom all the time continuing
to dress

PETULIA
WhatA°s her real name

ARCHIE
Prudence

PETULIA

And you named her Polo Thats kind

of sickening Archie

Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl
in his bed beyond which is an overturned tuba Archie
sighs somewhat philosophically not nearly as amused as
youd think

17 INT HOSPITAL

We are in the examining room of the orthopedic ward
Archie is working on Oliver the little Mexican boy of

Ae¢

seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the
flashback Now Oliver is healing nicely but its still
not pleasant to be examined A woman hovers in the back-
ground A nurse assists Archie Oliver is a brave solemn
little boy with shadows of fatigue around his eyes He
is also a tough little bastard let me tell you He is
now wearing the broken gold watch though to fit his
skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot

ARCHIE
I want him here every day For therapy

WOMAN

Si Yes doctor I do

Oliver speaks only a few words of English mostly the
necessary scatological and sexual phrases that would be
necessary in his line of business

ARCHIE

Every day Tell him that

The woman says it to Oliver in Spanish Oliver says
something obviously obscene

ARCHIE
Whatd he say

WOMAN

(EMBARRASSED)
He say yes

ARCHIE

(dubiously to woman)

You sure

(to Oliver)

Otherwise we keep you in the hospital
Youre not well just better
(to woman)

Say that

The woman tells Oliver in Spanish as Archie continues
examining the leg

ARCHIE
Sorry pal
Oliver says something in Spanish

WOMAN
(smiling a bit)

Ae¢

Where he learn such words shame on you

(then in Spanish)

Shame

Archie realizes Oliver is in great pain and close to tears
He stops the examination and rubs his hand gently through
the kids hair

ARCHIE

Every day Same time Two oclock

right on the dot

(he hits watch on wrist

The last bit of glass falls

out)

Sorry

Oliver swears in Spanish and the woman clacks her tongue

WOMAN

(EMBARRASSED)
He terrible

ARCHIE

(CHUCKLING)
I like the way he heals

Archie smiles and leaves The nurse is left with Oliver
who avoids her touch

NURSE
Cut that out you little spit

18 TNT CORRIDOR
Archie stops to hear what the woman has to say

WOMAN
About the bill Doctor
Barney is passing by

ARCHIE
Is she okay

BARNEY

(DARKLY)
Lunch
Archie looks up at the woman

a€¢ ARCHIE
His leg will be fine Dont worry too
much about the bill Just enough to pay it

WOMAN

I have money to pay it

A pipe smoking public relations man leads a casually
dressed group past Archie and the woman

PUBLIC RELATIONS MAN
Yea we had ABC filming a documentary
here last week

19 INT THE ROARING 20S CAFE DAY

All through the scene Barney and Archie will be served by
topless waitresses while other topless waitresses slide
down a big brass pole in the centre of the room As the
scene begins Barney is alone morosely munching a corned
beef sandwich Now Archie appears threading his way
through topless fashion show A topless ANNOUNCER is
doing the fashion commentary into a chrome microphone

as the topless models majestically move about

ANNOUNCER

(no fashion cliche untouched)

BARNEY

The best Irish stew in town

He is eating a corned beef sandwich Archie is ordering
the same

BARNEY

She said you beat her up Kidding

Archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm
Breasts with their pasties always intrude

BARNEY
You must have been a little rough on her

The second model a beautiful topless Negress is now
wandering past the tables The announcer goes on and on

ANNOUNCER

Archie eats his sandwich An off-duty topless waitress
sits in the corner having lunch holding a napkin over
her bosom with one hand while eating with the other

BARNEY
Archie

ARCHIE
Barney

BARNEY

(UNEASTLY)
You know how long Ive known you

Ae¢

ARCHIE
Forever

BARNEY

Thats how long And Polo and the kids

Thats exactly how long

Another silence Archie is watching the brass pole
Every other girl sliding down looks like Petulia Archie
accepts his hallucination with mild pleasure Barney
will not be stopped

BARNEYS VOICE

So I have a right to my opinion Its
breaking Wilmas heart Thats all we

talk about You think youre different
than anybody else Every time I leave my
house its the last time Im never coming
back Youre not listening to me Archie

ARCHIES VOICE
Barney for Chrissake Im listening to you

BARNEYS VOICE
Youre thinking about that hot cat in your
bed you bastard

Now in the continuous luncheon fashion show the
Psychedelic Yvonne has appeared topless amid a wild
pattern of lights The dialogue between Barney and Archie
continues elsewhere as the orgy of colors becomes

20 INT HOSPITAL

The left side of a patients face and the right shoulder
and arm of the patients body are sprayed with a special
liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very
quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow
These various colors indicate physical conditions They
are watched measured and timed by Archie Barney and
their assistants

BARNEYS VOICE

My record is far from spotless if you
dont know that who does But baby its
just not the answer not at our age

ARCHIES VOICE
So whats the answer baby

BARNEYS VOICE
a€¢ Someplace you can belch without saying
excuse me

ARCHIES VOICE
I can do that in the steam room at the YMCA

BARNEYS VOICE

(going right on)

And if a little monkey business comes along
whose gonna throw rocks You and Polo were
a marvellous looking couple

21 INT HOSPITAL LEAD ROOM

The patient is in a lead room being scanned by an atomic
computer The activator moves in a rhythmic graceful
pattern over the patients drab withered body In the
control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds
emanating from the computer each sound again indicating a
physical condition The patients room looks like a comfy
hotel room wood paneling couches magazines plants

The door leading to outside is three inches thick and
solid lead The noise from the equipment is deafening

Is

10 BARNEYS VOICE

Is there something wrong with being a
groovy looking couple People turning
around to stare What was it Archie
The sex bit Huh The ole sex bit

ARCHIES VOICE

Barney what would you say if I told you
that one day I just got very tired of being
married

22 INT A DECOMPRESSION OPERATING ROOM

This is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete
atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on
The patient can no longer be seen He is draped in plastic
which creates a sub-atmosphere The doctors and nurses

are swathed in plastic again in the atmosphere that lets
them function best (This is for real It exists for
instance at Mt Sinai Hospital in New York) The doctors
and nurses communicate with each other through throat
mikes and seem like other world automatons In all this
the patient simply does not exist The colors are eerie
yellows and blues with only occasionally and very
impersonally the red of blood

Ae¢

BARNEYS VOICE

(he never listens)

Its still better than being out there in
the dark all by your goddam lonesome

Nobody has a life anymore Quicksand
It scares me What do you want Archie

23 INT DOCTORS GYM

Archie and Barney are in a white cubicle playing handball
Their dialogue of course continues

ARCHIE

(GASPING)
I dont know what I want To feel something

BARNEY

(GASPING)

Thats no answer Archie grow up

The ball comes whizzing at Barney who suddenly wants it

to hit him which it does

BARNEY
Archie what am I going to do about Wilma

24 EXT ARCHIES APARTMENT LATE AFTERNOON

Archie has just parked his car and is going toward the
entrance when he sees Petulia sitting on a bus-stop
bench the tuba beside her She is dozing

PETULIA
(shouting above horn)

Ae¢

Dont pry Archie

She groggily enters the bus leaving the tuba in Archies
arms

25 INT BUS
Petulia takes a seat at an open window The bus is now

stopped for a moment more by the traffic light Petulia
under the best of circumstances doesnt make much sense
and now shes quite groggy

PETULIA

26 INT DANNER HOUSE KITCHEN

Petulia is wincing with pain as she puts groceries on

DAVID

PETULIA

DAVID
I thought maybe you

PETULIA

David

Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has
entered what is really a commonplace scene Something
has gone wrong and we cant for the life of us under-
stand what and before we can even guess we are

27 INT BUS

Petulia is still in the bus and we realize she has
0 imagined the foregoing She gets off the bus

28 EXT THE VERY MODEST OFFICES OF THE FRIENDS OF THE

EVERGREEN DAY

The sign on the door identifies this as a fraternal
organization founded in 1886 for the betterment of man
but the door is securely padlocked for the night
Archie stands there holding the tuba and feeling
stupid Haplessly he returns to his car and begins
stowing the tuba inside banging it against his nose

in the process He is a far from happy man

29 EXTINT A CLUTTERED MEAN LITTLE KITCIEN

IN A SLUM HOUSE DAY
Petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with
milk ice cream and fresh fruit A man enters from
another room He is a big sleepy-eyed Mexican He

has just awakened is wearing his pajama bottoms and
is hairy sweaty and fat

Petulia obviously knows tlleiman nods hello to which
the man answers a non-committal grunt He squeezes
past Petulia to drink from the sink He sticks his
head under the tap

PETULIA

(she speaks slowly because he

doesnt understand English)

I came by to make sure there was enough

milk and things

He finds the situation amusing reaching in past Petulia
to grab an orange There should be a feeling of a
possible relationship between Petulia and this man
In the next room a screen door opens and closes
Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see
Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway

30 INT ARCHIES APARTMENT NIGHT

Archie is doing research at a desk Working from notes
he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques
in the treatment of arthritis that would not require
surgery This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a
thoughtful man There are a couple of beer bottles
nearby The bed is still unmade The tuba stands

in the corner

The front doorbell rings and Archie crosses over to
let in his wife Polo a very attractive young matron

Polo looks about the apartment dubiously from tuba to
unmade bed She cant keep her eyes off the unmade bed
ARCHIE
(after ‘awhile )
Hi Polo

She opens her large handbag takes out a cellophane bag
of cookies

POLO
As usual I baked enough for an army

ARCHIE
Okay

POLO

necessary Also he is bugged by the cookies

ARCHIE

POLO
No Well yes Well yes and no

ARCHIE

(SMILING)
I think that covers all the possibilities
Polo laughs suddenly they share a moment of warmth

POLO

Its such a puzzle We really got on

so marvelously Never fought Never

screamed at each other Not once

a€¢ Something in his silence plus that damned unmade bed
is beginning to make her angry

POLO
Everybody we knew envied us

ARCHIE

We were a handsome couple

This makes her so angry she can now say what she came
to say

POLO

I think Ive fallen in love The

man is Warren Smith Hes an engineer
and very good with the children but he
wants to go back to school and get his
masters in hydraulics

(very long pause)

scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur
Will David now say Just for a second there

DAVID

PETULIA
About time

DAVID

He flings the bag at her barely missing her

are both stunned by this outburst

OLO

They
a€¢ (shakily)

Well this is a new side of your

natured For two people who never fight
Absently Polo sags down on the edge of the unmade bed
which has so fascinated her During the following no
matter what their bodies happen to be doing Polo and
Archie continue to speak in a most logical manner

ARCHIE
Whats so great about not fighting

POLO
I came to tell you about Warren

ARCHIE

You told me about Warren

He sits beside her well not really beside her actually
as far away from her as the bed will permit She decides
she will instantly get up off the bed but she does not

ARCHIE

(CONTINUING)
Warren is working for his mtstahs
in hydraulics

0 32

Polo knows she shouldnt smile at Archie making fun of
Warren but she does Archie touches her smile with his
finger then his hand moves across her face to the back
of her neck It is a clumsy gesture and they clumsily
sprawl on the bed

POLO

Well Im afraid well still need
all the money you pay me And Ill
be seeing him Archie

32A INT POLOS BEDROOM

Its a nice enough room which makes what she says
later quite absurd
She and Warren are preparing for bed A®m already ina
boring ritualistic fashion she with curlers in her
hair he hanging his trousers on a hanger

POLO IS VOICE
(continuing)
- at the house I mean until Warren

Ae¢

32B INT ARCHIES APARTMENT

By now entirely out of habit Archies hand has
pushed up Polos shirt as he continues the sex ritual
Wholly out of habit Polo lets him Their bodies old
friends for so long and once having been lovers
simply ignore whatever tripe their mouths happen to

be saying

POLO

(CONTINUING)

until he is established with some
hydraulics firma I hope it wont be
too long I mean for everybodys sake

ARCHIE
If hes a bright guy hell make out okay

POLO

Needless to say there are certain problems

By now Archie is on top of Polo and out of habit she
is adjusting her body for him

32B Continued

POLO
He lives in such a depressing rented
room It gives me claustrophobia

ARCHIE
Poor Polo
POLO

Its such an icky little room

Archie is perhaps two seconds away from entering Polo
when he suddenly sits up wondering what the hell hes
been doing He walks to the far side of the room
sticks his shirt in wipes the sleeve of his shirt
across his face

Polo feels no particular rancor the entire thing was
totally unplanned and she has no more desire to

make it with Archie than he has with her She pulls
down her skirt and adjusts her garters

ARCHIE
Tell the kids Ill come for them
0 Sunday at eight

POLO

Theyll be ready I thought the
decent thing was to come here and
talk in a civilized manner About
the change in my situation

ARCHIE
I appreciate it Polo

POLO
Good night Archie

ARCHIE

Youve got a run in your stocking

Polo exits Archie cant figure out why in the world
he even thought of making love to Polo after all this
time He sits down on the unmade bed finds one of
Polos cookies on the sheets and pops it into his
mouth

34 EXT STEPS OF ARCHIE S APARTMENT DAY

Petulia waits on the steps When she is not being observed
when she is not on there are moments when Petulia seems
utterly forlorn This is such a moment But then she sees
Archie and May and instantly she is with it

ARCHIE
Well of all people

PETULIA
All that crap about the humanitarian-
ism of the medical profession
She darts alongside the building and begins frantically
calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an
aloha hat

May looks at Archie questioningly

ARCHIE

Dont ask

Petulia and the old man are back joining Archie and May
on the steps

PETULIA

(ACCUSINGLY)
Archie this is Mr Howard

O MR HOWARD

Phillip Sousa She said it would cheer

her up and make her want to live She

gave me five bucks
ARCHIE
(looking at Petulia)
All that broken glass

MR HOWARD

(finished with the tuba)

Goodbye Mr Howard Goodbye Petulia

Petulia crosses to Mr Howard and presses a dollar bill
into his shirt pocket

PETULIA

ARCHIE

Im sorry Mr Howard Goodbye Petulia

But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping
her fingers in annoyance Mr Howard leaves The door
remains open for Petulia to leave May watches Petulia
in amused tolerance

ARCHIE
Whats the next move Petulia

PETULIA

People are passing in the hallway peering in

PETULIA

How many years were you married Archie

36 INT HOSPITAL NIGHT

Its after 3 am and Archie is hollow-eyed and drenched
0 with sweat from an emergency operation He is with a
patient in the recovery room obviously concerned about

i 36 Continued

the patients chances He crosses to a sink bathes his
face and hands with cold water He is exhausted As we
sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking

and see beyond the kookiness so for an instant we see
beyond Archies look of professional assurance and see

the fearful uncertainty He now moves into the corridor
with each step assuming the doctors look that is expected
of him

PETULIAS VOICE

Hi

Archie turns Petulia is in the medical library with
books scattered all about her

ARCHIE
Youre kidding

PETULIA
I think Ive discovered a cure for cancer

ARCHIE
Well if youre on the brink of something
How did they let you in

Ae¢
She joins him
PETULIA
You look exhausted

ARCHIE

Do you know its almost three Doesnt

Mr Danner worry at all about things like that
Petulia looks at him reverently

PETULIA

(TENDERLY)

Look at you

Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line
from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop
him for a moment Then without a word they fall into
step beside each other leaving the hospital

37 EXT PARKING LOT NIGHT

At this time of night hardly a car remains Archies car
is quite by itself

ARC HIE

him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding
very touching It is a facet of Petulia he has never
seen before

ARCHIE
Where to I could use a steak sandwich

Theres a jazz joint that stays open

all night

He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him
a€¢ awkwardly aggressively

ARCHIE

(SURPRISED)

Hey come on A®m why this sudden

Petulia is relentless and voracious Her hands and mouth
are everywhere on Archie A car is a lousy bedroom but
it will have to do Heads bump against windows elbows
jam against steering wheels but Petulia will not be
stopped Finally Archie grips her shoulders and forces
her to stop

ARCHIE

39 INT SUPERMARKET PRE-DAWN

Though the streets outside are deserted the supermarket
is jammed with people Archie is pushing a market

keeps finding things to buy Archie knows that Petulia

is going through this massive shopping spree simply to

get even for his rejection of the moment she chose to

Petulia and Archie leave the supermarket with their rolling
basket of groceries There is no one else on the street

In front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu-
lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there

but making no sound Petulia quizzically looks up at the
silent violent clown while Archie waits for her at the
car Finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at
him She starts running toward the car suddenly wanting

0 very much to be with him They kiss lightly

Archie is sound asleep breathing heavily Petulia sits
wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window her
head resting on the sill lonely

somehow as far apart as two human beings can be

44 INT ARCHIES BEDROOM NIGHT

n the midst of her sleep Petulia begins jabbering in
some language all her own Archie Is eyes open and he
looks at her and he smiles Still sound asleep

Petulia finishes her statement whatever the hell it
was and settles down on the pillow Archie looks at her
She wakes up They look at each other so gravely that
they both begin to smile Neither one is having the
best night of their life but both are aware of a sense
a€¢ of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly

45 INT ARCHIEtS BEDROOM MORNING

Petulia wakes up suddenly Though she is nude under the
sheets Archie is fully dressed for his day with the
boys Though his clothes are very sporty he looks
anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone-

ARCHIE

To satisfy myself thats who Okay

He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him

PETULIAS VOICE
Hi Whats all the noise

ARCHIE

PETULIA
Fat Mike

ARCHIE
Hes not all that fat
During this series of dumb ordinary telephone conversa-

Ae¢
tions to follow we begin seeing the moments which have
brought on Petulias current crisis with Oliver

48 INT BULL RING TIJUANA

Its a hot summer afternoon Petulia and David have
driven down from San Francisco They are members of the
San Francisco Matador Club David has drunk too much
wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun
have made him violently ill Though there are still two
bulls left to kill David and Petulia are leaving As she
moves down the spindly stairway Petulia becomes aware of
Oliver He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher
shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market
They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be
sold as the real thing

49 EXT A STREET IN TIJUANA

Petulia and David in their convertible David has passed
out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a
time trying to move the car out of the parking space
Again kids swarm about her like wild animals trying to
sell hats cushions gum pottery etc Again she sees
Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like

0 Oliver)

40 50 EXT BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA LATE AFTERNOON

Thousands of cars are waiting to get through Hot noisy
dusty unbearable Kids storm every car hustling their
captured audience Among them is Oliver Have the others
been Oliver In Petulias exhaustion and discomfort the
heat the flies the blaring horny she cant be sure
(NOTE All through the Tijuana scenes we HEAR Archie
and Petulias telephone conversation It is utterly banal
and they know it and are amused by its banality)
PETULIA I was dozing

ARCHIE Thats good

PETULIA You left without having breakfast

ARCHIE had a cup of coffee on the way

PETULIA A cup of coffee You should have had

eggs or waffles

ARCHIE Im fine

PETULIA Me too

ARCHIE Make some toast too And milk
Breakfast is a very important meal

PETULIA I wish youd remember that

ARCHIE Well goodbye

QO PETULIA Archie

ARCHIE Yes

PETULIA You wont forget to phone

51 EXT WHARF

Archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons
toward the boat He is very pleased with his absolutely
nothing phone conversation

52 EXT BOAT DECK

Children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck
The boat is passing Alcatraz Island Archie and the boys
are standing at the rail

ARCHIE
They used to think that escape from that
prison was impossible

52A EXT BOAT DECK

Same scene different Sunday Warren and the boys are
standing at the rail

WARREN
They used to think that escape from that
prison was impossible

52B BACK TO SCENE 52
We resume with Archie and the boys

SI
52B Continued

MIKE

ARCHIE
Warren Well we could have gone somewhere

Mom thinks hes getting a little old for
being called Stevie in fact

Ae¢

ARCHIE

I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all
calling you Stevie two weeks ago -- I was
STEVIE

Before that

MIKE
Warren says that Alcatraz taught the world you
can get out of anything if you want to bad
enough

ARCHIE
Thats what Warren said eh

MIKE
Yes Dad

53 ANOTHER VIEW OF THE BOAT

The boys are watching Archie who is in that section of the

boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept

Archie is on the ship telephone He is trying to keep

a straight face but since he is obviously talking to
Petulia

it is difficult

a€¢ MIKE

(to another kid)

Doctors can do things like that Call

their patients from wherever they are

Archie finishes the call and returns to them smiling

ARCHIE
How about clams on the wharf when we get back

MIKE
Clams make Steve vomit

ARCHIE
Oh

MIKE
You forgot that

ARCHIE

No it just slipped my mind

Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are
somewhere else
54 INT A FISH PLACE ON THE WHARF

While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves Archie
is at the wall telephone

ARCHIE
a€¢ Hello there

LATE AFTERNOON
55 EXT THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA

During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia
into giving him a lift in her convertible Petulia is
so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate
Oliver is an absolute scoundrel David is such a clod
passing out in the back seat his legs hanging out over
the door of the car one sandal missing His beautiful
face is somehow an obscene parody of itself fiery

red from the sun

Oliver mimics David Petulia the guard at the gate
dances skips romps annoys Petulia makes her laugh
dares her goads her Finally when Petulias car is
just one away from the border guard Oliver impudently
hops into the seat beside her expecting to be thrown
out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain
But the jokes on Oliver Petulia is even kookier than
he is Is it the look of David that sickens her Is

it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the
driving while he lies collapsed and useless Is it

that useless that goads her

Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no
importance she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the
moment they reach the guard All it amounts to is two
kooks having a few seconds of horsing around

The joke is on both of them -- the guard harassed by
the honking of thousands of cars and having fully
inspected the car just ahead of Petulia waves the
convertible on through

Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the
border to let Oliver climb out but he just sits there
Petulia thinks okay you little bastard and

zooms down the highway intending to stop at the first
moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Olivers
tough little face
During this we hear Archie and Petulias second tele-
phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before
ARCHIE Hi there

says that this phone is for the military and is to be
used only in emergency Archie approaches it warily
then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids
Archie wants to get back to Petulia

59 INT ARCHIES APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY DAY

Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys is thinking
a€¢ about Petulia waiting in his apartment and feels pretty
damn good about the whole thing He opens the door of
his apartment He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers
60 INT APARTMENT

It is empty Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone
All the joy goes out of him The apartment is a mess
The television set is on a program without sound of
soldiers fighting Archie is so disappointed that
Petulia isnt here He angrily flips the dial getting
the same type of program

ARCHIE

A nice neat kid

After all the exuberance he feels so empty Everywhere
things are scattered about

61 INT BEDROOM

The bedroom is the worst of all The sheets and blanket
have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall
mall onto the floor behind Archie really is annoyed
Then he stops he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets
and blanket on the floor A lifeless arm protrudes
Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets
Petulia is broken bloodied and seemingly dead

Thig- phone is off the hook Archie doesnt know where to
turn first He feels Petulias throat for a pulse isnt
sure she has one

Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se 23
Archie attempts heart massage but Petuliats so taped up
from the broken rib that this is impossible

Archie presses his mouth over Petulias to attempt to get
her breathing again He tries this only for an instant
then crosses to the phone hangs it up and dials an
emergency number

Archie goes back to Petulia He feels again for a pulse
in her throat can find no pulse He begins trembling

As always when a crisis really happens it isnt as easy
as the Red Cross advertisements say Her mouth wont

open right His mouth seems unable to make the connection
with hers It all looks more like very bad love-making
than a life-saving procedure

62 INTEXT HALLWAY and STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE S APARTMENT

Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on

a stretcher A third walks behind her pressing a rubber
oxygen mask over her mouth

We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered but limp-
ing along nevertheless Television cokes sex stereo
facials isometric exercises funny-papers ailments
boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied
Doors are opening up and down the hallway People come
out to stare A big friendly old sheepdog wild with
enthusiasm leaps at the stretcher and almost topples
Petulia Archie smeared with Petulias blood his
shirt-tails out in a state of shock himself whams the
dog as hard as he can This entire sequence should

seem like a nightmare

The dogs owner goes berserk

DOGS OWNER

Dont you hit Lennie

Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond
At every door there is a tenant A jumble of voices all
spoken together

1ST TENANT
0 Thats sex for you

2ND TENANT
It could be a gas leak

0 3RD TENANT
Shes dead

4TH TENANT
Those rescue cops never give up
5TH TENANT

Yes but theyre all racists

Of course one of the officers is a Korean and the other

a Negro All through this we have also been aware of many
TV sets all with programs with various kinds of violence
One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable TV and
we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the
Jungle by helicopters

Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead
the way down the steps Half a dozen hippies loaded

down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up
the steps Everything is chaos

The officers just cant manage the stretcher down the
narrow stairway Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every
which way - all in the name of saving her life

7TH TENANT

Ae¢

(a rich old queen in

purple Bermuda shorts)

I had trouble like that with my piano Two

hundred dollars to bring it through the window

And its never been the same

A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and
the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm

63 EXT A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHT

This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north
fromMexico

The restaurant is a mass of neon and does very well inthe

hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a

break on their way north

Among the cars many are filled with bull fight

afficianados

Its about ten pm There is a general feeling of

exhaustion and spent passions People are bleary-eyed

recovering from hangovers beginning to feel the effects

of sunburns All this we see later First we see Oliver

Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who

0 has just awakened David is probably just about to say

Who the hell are you when Petulia appears carrying a

cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice

David takes a sip of coffee Oliver grabs at the orange
juice toppling it spilling some of it on the seat but

saving most He gulps it down then uses the straw to
make bubbles David looks at Oliver and then at
Petulia all through the bubbles

PETULIA
Say hello to Petulias Folly
David says nothing

DAVID
Oh

wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she wont
DAVID
You promised Oliver San Francisco

PETULIA

DAVID

Like hell you didnt

David abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the
wheel He signals for Petulia to get in beside Oliver
Petulia hesitates

DAVID

Shes stunned His hand reaches out and brutally jerks
her into the car

DAVID

I dig

CAMERA HOLDS on Petulias frightened face Now suddenly

0 the face has a tube in the nose theres another tube in
her throat and shes unconscious

0 6L INT EMERGENCY ROOM HOSPITAL

Half a dozen people are working to keep Petulia alive
Theyre used to their work its no big deal for them
Actually the feeling should be that theyre as relaxed
as if they were mechanics working on a motor car
Archie sits on a white stool in a corner watching
everything not as a doctor any more but as adeeply
involved man When one of the doctors hits a vein by
mistake and murmurs Whoops Archie can take no

more and leaves

65 INT DOCTORS SHOWER ROOM

Archie sits on a little stone shelf just letting the
water from the shower hit him

mixture of concern and anger

Archie nods dully

BARNEY

67 INT INTENSE CARE UNIT DAWN

Archie is in Petulias little cubicle slumped ona
chair sound asleep Petulia lies on the bed tubes
protruding from arms and neck She is still unconscious
Archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to
hook up another pint of blood Archies presence
disconcerts the nun She cant show her annoyance
openly but is so disturbed she does her work badly
this time

NUN

Who would do such a thing to a girl like
this Shes a child Is there an
orthopaedic problem Dr Bollen

Archie doesnt answer

NUN
A doctor should get his sleep

ARCHIE

You left the needle in

The nun would like to scream at Archie about the
impropriety of his presence here but she cant
She is proud of the bottle of blood

NUN
From the Archbishops Fund

ARCHIE
Take the needle out

0 NUN
All races and creeds Why hasnt her
husband been notified

ARCHIE
I suppose theyve tried

NUN

It would be such a nice surprise to have his
picture here when she finally awakens
Wouldnt that be nice

ARCHIE
Yes

NUN
t would give her some small comfort

ARCHIE
would put a bit more tape around the needle

NUN
mentioned her this morning in the chapel
mention all my criticals

a€¢ ARCHIE
n the future be more careful of the needle

NUN

She hardly makes a bump under the sheets

She leaves Archie moves closer to Petulia examining
her throat and eyes for vital signs He pushes open an
eyelid and Petulias dead eye stares glassily into his
living face

68 INT HOSPITAL DAY

We spend awhile watching Archie function as a doctor
moving through the wards examining broken legs arms
or whatever In one of these scenes we pass through
the orthopaedic room

69 INT ORTHOPAEDIC ROOM

Oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath Hes
only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely
notices him simply waving to him as he does to other
patients who dont need his care anymore Oliver is
too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn
about the doctor Archie goes and we stay with Oliver

OLIVERS ATTENDANT
Come on come on get on with it

70 INT A SMALL BEDROOM IN THE DANNER HOUSE

JUST BEFORE DAWN

Three weeks ago Oliver is wide awake wolfing down a
loafof bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen
As he gnaws on the bread he listens to indistinct
sounds from the master bedroom moans and groans

a sudden cry all of which he supposes are the sounds
of love-making He grins to himself in the dark
Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the
hall She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a
blouse and is struggling into a coat Her hair is
tousled her face filled with anguish

71 INT STAIRWAY DANNER HOUSE

Petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed
Oliver down the steps He is protesting Before they
can reach the front door the door of the master
bedroom opens David is standing there in his

pyjama pants

DAVID

Hey San Francisco

He pronounces it like Oliver does He comes down
the steps three at a time He stops before the kid

DAVID

(GENTLY)

I sure hope theres no hard feelings

Oliver understands none of this and of course David
knows this but it doesnt stop him

DAVID

It isnt a question of hospitality I

want you to understand that I feel

terrible Dragging you all the way

up to San Francisco and then not even

showing you Fishermans Wharf

Comprehend

Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys
to the car

DA VID

0 71A INT DANNER HOUSE LIVING ROOM DAWN

DAVID

(to Oliver)

Whats the rushy Whereas the fire

He stoops down beside the boy and shows him a
wrist watch

DAVID
Youve go to have some little memento
Right

PETUL IA

David for Gods sakes

The wrist watch is much too big for Olivers skinny
wrist so David starts to fasten it around Olivers
biceps Even this is too skinny so David starts
fastening it around Olivers lower leg Oliver

has no idea what is happening but his hustlers
heart tells him he is being given something very
valuable Petulia is repelled

DAVID

(to Oliver)

You see the basic problem is we just dont
have the room for all the folks my old
lady invites for a visit Were kinda
short of room Id give you the shirt off
my back Im West-Texas and proud of it
But start loading up the house with
make-believe kids plus every Tom Dick
and Harry whose one and only claim to
fame is that he knows how to do it --

72 EXT DANNER HOUSE DAWN

Petulia begins sobbing and trying to tug the boy
toward the lift

DAVID
Hands off
The watch wont fasten to the leg either David
splendor

tries to fit it around the boys neck David begins
to cry

DA vV1D

It wont fit any place

Petulia somehow gets Oliver into the lift and pushes the
button which starts it moving upward

DAVID

(calling up)

I dont want any hard feelings It

was nothing personals Hey well look

way Have a real old-fashioned fiesta

Well have a ball Oliver

During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver
Oliver infuriated at Petulia defiantly shows her that he
has Davids watch in his fist

OL I VER

Petulia stares out toward the sea Davis is still screaming
atlthem and his voice sounds so unlikely in all the

of morning coming to San Francisco

73 INT HOSPITALS UNDERGROUND GARAGE DAY

The place is almost empty but the fans are wildly
enthusiastic and are placed to look like thousands for the
TV camera The womens team is on the rink skating

0 banging into each other with great good-natured brutality
One of the skaters bucks another clear off the rink

through the rail

The kids are in heaven but Polo is so shocked she instinc-—
tively turns-to Archie and buries her face in his shoulder
Out of habit he lets her even touching the back of her
head comfortingly assuring her no fatality has occurred
Mike the ace matchmaker watches them with satisfaction

fists she seems to become Petulia

had said about Polo He does a how odd without saying it

ARCHIE
Shes not going to die

POLO
What a shame

ARCHIE
She has her first visitor Mr Danner
her

tube

Polo couldnt care less Five skaters smash into each other
on the rink but Polo doesnt flinch She wouldnt think of
turning to Archie for comfort

79 INT PETULIAS HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

The Mr Danner who is with Petulia is Davids father
Petulia lies in the bed staring straight ahead at an
enormous cotton giraffe obviously a gift The patient in
the next bed has three middle-aged girl friends visiting

-

hey are playing bridge Their presence frustrates Mr
a€¢ Danner The other patients TV set is on and on the

we barely notice the continued violence of the outside

MR DANNER

Its been a terrible shock to us
to Mother and meOur sailor boy
and his pretty bride

79A INT FATHER DANNERS LIVING ROOM

He stands at a great eye of a window Mother Danner is
mournfully quartering apples for an apple pie

MR DANNERS VOICE

As I told Mother the values we lived

by just dont seem to mean anything at

all anymore Our kids can chuck out

two thousand years of Western civilization
of Christianityas though it wasnt
worth a red cent

0 79B INT PETULIAS HOSPITAL ROOM
MR DANNER

(CONTINUING)

I must say Mothers answer surprised

and well really sort of tickled me
Its easy to be an angel when youre

old and worn out and nobody wants you
anymore You see we do try Petulia

I mean there you were in that mans
apartment Where I come from in little
pockets of ignorance I suppose youd call
ityoull find people who still live by
the unwritten law

790 INT FATHER DANNERS LIVING ROOM

MR DANNER

Theres still many a county courthouse

where the husband could kill both

parties and not spend one night in jail

OS We hear SOUNDS of a bell ringing incessantly in short
bursts

79D INT PETULIAS HOSPITAL ROOM

The bell is still ringing signifying the end of visiting
hours and the other patients visitors sigh put the playing
cards together and prepare to leave Mr Danner makes no
move to leave

MR DANNER

In the hospital of my dreams people

wont be chased out like sheep People

are better than most of the medicines

they give you David has finallygot

around to repairing that wharf He hired

a couple of boys The three of them are
really working up a sweat Hes thinking

of sailing all the way down the coast to

Lima Thats in Peru

All through this theres no response whatever from Petulia
Her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe

MR DANNER

They say Lima is a terrific city If

you watch out for flies and take sensible
sanitary precautions Ill tell you a
secret but dont you snitch Im using
propaganda on David so that the four of
0 us can go Mothers a better sailor than
I am Even though I served eighteen

months on a mine sweeper Which should
have prepared me for anything

79D Continued
A nun looks in

NUN

(BRIGHTLY)
Visiting hours are over

MR DANNER

(taking his turmoil

out on the nun)

I had lunch with your Mr Pearl less
than two weeks ago

The nun looks blank

MR DANNER
Mr Pearl happens to be the superintendent
of this Hospital Two weeks ago at the
Blue Fox Restaurants Just the six of usl
The nun shrugs and leaves Mr Danner is really trembling
now from his controlled emotion Petulia will not take her
eyes from the giraffe The patient in the next bed is
grumbling something about whats sauce for the goose should
be sauce for the gander etc Mr Danner abruptly takes a
a€¢ small leather bound photograph from his pocket Its the
wedding picture of Petulia and David Without a word he
puts
it on the night stand Petulia will not look at it

79E EXT DAVID AND PETULIA DANNER HOUSE

The end of Sc 72 is very quickly replayed

80 EXT BUS STATION DAWN

During Sc 79E and 80 we continue to hear Mr Danner Its

a tiny bus station and hardly anyone is around this time of
morning Petulia waits with Oliver who is very annoyed at
what has been done to him A few other early travelers are

about- As the bus comes into sight Oliver grasping his
last

chance of freedom suddenly darts away IN A SERIES OF

FLASHES we see Oliver hit by a car the look of agony on

Petuliaas face the reaction of the spectators and finally

the ultimate image the boy pinned under the wheel

MR DANNERS VOICE

(during preceding scene)

David and I went at it hot and heavy

About the value of psychiatry I mean
sensible psychiatry None of that Sex-
is-the-reason-for-everything junk It

E wont ever replace a visit to the wood-
shed and a good whack across the backside
but its late in the old ball game for that

81 JN 7-1 0 PETULIAS HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT
a€¢ The nun reappears

NUN
Im sorry Sir but its time for the
ladys medication

MR DANNER

Does anyone ever report how filthy

this room is

He loses all his aplomb He squats he points he finds
imaginary objects on the floor

MR DANNER

Look at this Look at this I

personally raised fifty thousand

dollars for this Hospital during

the last campaign You didnt

now that did you Well ask Mr

Pearl’ I mean if you knew what

he looked like Filthy

He gets up to go The nun leaves Mr Danner brushes

imaginary dust from his knees Hes perspiring dis-

hevelled and still hasnA°t said what he came to say
He waits there a moment more Finally in a flat voice

without even looking at him

PETULIA

Tell David its alright He can

come out of the cupboard

The old man almost sobs Instead he exclaims ina
jolly voice

MR DANNER
Chin up

81A ROLLER DERBY

This time we are with the TV CAMERAMAN and we are
looking through his scanner We see all the excited
people but among them sit Archie and Polo as cold as
death Suddenly on the scanner we see Polo rise and
begin to leave tugging the two boys along with her
Archie makes no move to stop them

82 INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY

Archie wearing his white doctors smock enters
Petulias room

83 INT HOSPITAL ROOM

Thebed where the second patient lay is empty In
Petulias bed is the withered old man who earlier had
taken Petulias place in the Intense Care Unit Hes
quite chipper now but is in many splints and braces

OLD MAN

Archie turns to face the nun in attendance

ARCHIE
Where is she
NUN

ARCHIE
Who picked her up

NUN
Her husband I suppose

ARCHIE

He hurries down the hall Thenun is startled

OLD MAN

81E EXT DANNER HOUSE DAY

Archie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the
cliff At the front of the house we see David and two
colored men at work on the wharf At the wharf is the
yacht Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins
ringing the bell

85 INT THE MASTER BEDROOM

Petulia couldnt be lovelier or happier Shes ina

Is

special hospital bed There are flowers everywhere She
has her own colour TV set which is silently showing
scenes of violence An efficient nurse is in attendance

0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed and Petulia
is brushing the nurses hair

Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality
of it all Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too

PETULIA

Hi Archie

Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there
is a pitcher of tomato juice Because he has nothing
else to do he sniffs the tomato juice

PETULIA

(to nurse)

This is Dr Bollen of the Hospital
Hes a splendid doctor

(to Archie)

This is Agnes Lillywhite

NURSE

Our young lady is doing nicely We
have a few problems but nothing
serious

PETULIA
a€¢ I get hiccups I go along merrily
hiccupping for hours on end

ARCHIE
Why did you leave the hospital

PETULIA

I was feeling ever so much better Archie

Mrs Danner looks in She is wearing an apron and
stirring a batch of something

MRS DANNER

Will you be staying for lunch sir

Goodness knows theres plenty of meatloaf

She goes and David enters He looks extremely handsome
He wears white duck pants and a slip-over sweater And
a happy-go-lucky grin

PETULIA

You two havent met
(to David)

This is Dr Bollen

DAVID

(CHEERFULLY )

Yes I thought so Hello there

David sees that Archie has no intention of shaking
his hand so he crosses to the bed and begins to
playfully Drank Petulia up and down

ARCHIE
(to Petulia)
I want you to go back to the hospital

DAVID
Dr Worthington says shes doing fine
Hes going to make daily house calls

PETULIA
Hes very good about that

ARCHIE

Petulia mA®

During this Mr Danner has entered He is really the
only one not good at the charade

PETULIA

(CHEERFULLY )
Well youre finally meeting our
whole family

MR DANNER

Dr Bollen I wouldnt exactly call
this good taste Not to mention
medical ethics
DAVID

Dad you old fuddy-duddy things happen

Archie suspects he is having a nightmare With the
exception of Mr Danner he has never seen so many
cheerful people in one place

ARCHIE

(to Petulia)

You told the policeman you had a
dizzy spell

PETULIA
Right I fell on my bottom

0 ARCHIE
You were beaten up You were somebodys
punching bag

MR DANNER

girl

ARCHIE
Your son nearly killed this girl

DAVID

(FRIENDLY)
Hey now listen doe Ill stand still
for only so much

MR DANNER

(to the nurse)

I want you to remember what this man
just said

(to Archie)

Though its none of your business my
boy was in Baton Rouge Louisiana
Looking at boats

PETULIA
Weve decided were quite happy with
the one we have

DAVID

When Dad phoned me I was having dinner

with a cousin of ours Real mouth-

watering Creole cooking

He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this
were some kind of private joke Archie crosses to
Petulia and just stands there looking at her He
doesnt know what to do

PETULIA

(HAPPILY)

Im fine Archie Except I burp a lot

Everybody gets dizzy spells

Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed
brushing the nurses hair to David to Mr Danner whos
obviously annoyed at Archies bad taste to Mrs Danner
who is in the dining room setting up an extra place

for Archie What can he do Abruptly he rushes from

the house

86 EXT HOUSE

Archie runs toward the lift that will move him up the
cliff He cant get away fast enough He climbs into
the lift and pushes the button The lift begins moving
but too slowly for him He hops off the lift and begins
scrambling up the side of the cliff

87 INT PETULIAS BEDROOM

Petulia looks out the window and sees Archie scrambling
up the cliff She fits a curler into the nurses hair

PETULIAS VOICE
Going back to the house was the only
thing I could do
scenes 87A B D and E occur only in Petulias mind

87A EXT ATOP CLIFF DAY

Petulia is waiting for Archie at the top of the cliff
as he staggers toward her Since everything is taking
place in her mind this is how Petulia really is

PETULIA

(CONTINUING)

Where else could I go A lonely hotel
room I dont have a penny of my own
Mr Danner promised me Id never be left
alone I thought Id try it for a few
days Dont be-angry It was nobodys
fault Actually if anyone is to blame
its you Archie

ARCHIE

(GASPING)
MeIo

87B INT FAIRMONT HOTEL NIGHT

Petulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie
Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket
to reclaim his coat Petulia rushes up to him with
none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting but
with absolute desperation Archie is dressed as he
is on the hill (Scene 86)

PETULIA
Im Petulia Danner save me like
you saved Oliver save me from David

Dont lust scramble up the hill like a
a€¢ b oody fool o

87B Continued
Archie is stunned
ARCHIE
Im looking for the ticket for my raincoat

PETULIA
NOL
87C INT PETULIAS BEDROOM

From her bedroom window Petulia watches Archie scramble
up the hill

PETULIAS VOICE
Coming for me in that pokey little car

87D EXT A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY ROAD DAY

In Petulias mind a great white ambulance is moving
majestically through towering trees carrying Petulia
to safety

PETULIAS VOICE

(CONTINUING)
9 Why didnt you bring a proper ambulance
As though you really meant it

ARCHIES VOICE
I didnt know what to do I was going
from one moment to the next

PETULIAS VOICE

Spectacular entrance lousy exit Sounds
familiar Archie

Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia

PETULIAS VOICE
No its not your fault

87E THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DAY

Petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because
she has something very serious to say to Archie She
is with him on the rocks below the bridge

PETULIA

I went back to the house because I owed it
to David I have a brown thumb when it

comes to men I put them on the Cross and
call them Jesus And there they hang I
dont know why I do it Not because of any
high opinion of myself oh Archie if you
only knew

87E Continued

She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David
standing there An incredibly heroic figure in a white
blazer and turtle neck sweater Yet somehow we must
sense that despite how grand David looks at any moment
in Petulias mind he may leap to his death

PETULIA

Look at him Isnt he super A six foot
three Coca Cola bottle Empty I did
that Id ruin you Archie

87F INT BEDROOM

We are now back in visual reality with Petulia and
the playful David who is trying to make Petulia laugh
which she does

PETULIAS VOICE
David was the gentlest man I ever knew

88 EXT CLIFF

Archie has neared the top of the cliff His pants are
ripped his hands are scraped he is gasping in anguish

Ae¢

PETULIAS VOICE

Id ruin you In five weeks Id be

running around with a black eye

By now Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is
a complete mess He turns for one last look at the
Danner house and the yacht beyond He shakes his fist
maniacally

89 EXTO MUIR WOODS DAY

During the following SEQUENCE OF SCENES Archie is
trying to get back to normality Hes having a nice
sensible talk with Warren Smith Polos fiance It

is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are
being told about the forest by an Irish guide In the
background Archies two children are playing with
Warrens child

WARREN

Its never too soon to think of the
boys education

Warren winks at him knowingly

ARCHIE

Nearby the guide is explaining something to the Indians

Archie smiles hoeefully

90 INTO A MARVELOUS RESTAURANT NIGHT

Beyond is the entire shockingly beautiful panorama of
San Francisco Archie and May are having champagne
cocktails They clink glasses and look at each other
through candlelight Archie spills some of his cock-
tail but May doesnt spill a drop Archie smiles
hopefully

91 INTO DISCOTHEQUE NIGHT

Archie dances with many girls some hippies some chic
all terribly young and unsmiling Archie smiles
hopefully

92 EXT A SA111

For the first EQ ENCE BEGAN Archie is

not smiling He Lz ri g at Petulia Archie and his
boys are riding on ou side of a cable car The car
has stopped at the t p of the hill as has the car going
the other way in the other car is Petulia by herself
Petulia waves frst Archie waves back Petulia has
shopping parcels

AR C HIE
You look better

PETULIA
Feel marvelous Michael and Stevie
Archie nods

ARCHIE
We-re going to see the penguins
Everything okay with your

PETULIA
Oh yes fine
The cars start down their separate ways

93 INT PENGUIN PLACE DAY

Thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the
music of Pomp and Circumstance Through the Public
Address System a voice explains that the penguins
represent all nations and are gathered here for their
own Olympics which they originated two million years ago
when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes
Archie senses someone staring at him turns and sees
Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels He
tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids but

he cannot Actually he doesnt want to ignore Petulia
He looks back she is still there smiling happily
Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are then
starts toward Petulia
The penguins are now going through various acrobatics

while the narrator is telling more about their exotic
origins Archie stumbles through laughing children

ruins a tourists snapshot etc until he finally reaches
Petulia

Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby
carriage Everyone thinks its adorable

Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say
He hasnt decided whether to be angry that she has followed
him- or amused or delighted -- or all three

0 93

Now the taped music is blaring a Loud marching song as
the penguins lumberingly form into a Roman legion The
laughter music and applause make any intimate conversa-
tion almost impossible But Petulia is waiting for

Archie to say something

Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to
stare at his father accusingly Mike wont stop staring
Mike now tries to make Stevie turn and look accusingly
with him Archie doesnt know what to do0

Finally Petulia rises and gathers her parcels still
quite pleasant She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves

it for hero Its from a sportswear shop colorful and

gay As Archie gives Petulia the parcel she touches

his hand running her fingers lightly over his skin
thoughtful as though wanting to remember something
Petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit
Archie almost calls her back but there is too much noise
9 INT CORRIDOR ARCHIES APARTMENT DAY

Archie is returning from work weighted down with
books for his research plus miscroscope

He sees his apartment door ajar His heart stops
He kicks his door open with his foot not daring to
think who will be inside

95 INT ARCHIES APARTMENT

No youre wrong Its not Petulia Two elderly
gentlemen in spotless dungarees are just finishing
installing a portable greenhouse in Arc hies living
room The Mexican paper flowers have been carefully
moved

FIRST GENTLEMAN

Oh oho We were supposed to be out of

here before you came home Dr Bollen

So youd think it came from Santa Claus

The two elderly gentlemen chuckle at Archies puzzled
look

FIRST GENTLEMAN

Wonderful isn g t - t They sell like
hot cakes Gives you something alive

in all this stone

ARCHIE

There must be some mistake

He sags down on a chair draped in his research books
The two old gentlemen couldnt be more pleased

FIRST GENTLEMAN

Mac and I get a big kick out of peoples
first reaction Its not a toy Its

a working greenhouse You control heat
and humidity with these

(he indicates dials)

Youve got a little bit of everything
Ornamental plants Zinnias Asters
Even a little vegetable garden The
most important thing to remember is

to keep the sun out These new kind
of lights work so much better theres
no comparison

Ae¢
ARCHIE
Youve got the wrong apartment 1

FIRST GENTLEMAN

(CHEERFULLY)
No we have not s Dr Bollen3

ARCHIE

ARCHIE
This one heat and this one humidity

FIRST GENTLEMAN

Exactly Weve left a manual of
operations and wetll check everything
out in a month Okay Dr Bollen
ARCHIE

(still chuckling)
Okay okay Goodbye
He enters the greenhouse having to stoop almost double as
the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment

96 INT GREENHOUSE

Though extremely uncomfortable Archie is entirely happy
Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a
kooky bouquet He is positively exultant He adds radishes
and turnips to the bouquet This is the happiest we have
ever seen Archie

Ae¢
97 EXT DANNER HOUSE DAY

Archiets car is parked on the cliff

The Danner house is dark deserted abandoned

Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand
The yacht has gone And so has Petulia

Archie feels utterly alone and as a matter of fact he is
He tosses the bouquet into the water The lettuce floats

97A EXT THE YACHT DAY

Theoretically we should be at some flea bag port in South
America Mostly we SEE the yacht

97A Continued

Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht She looks much better
now Weeks have passed she has a golden tan Beside her

a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which
would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists
mostly of music

David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries

He too is deeply tanned marvelously healthy but somehow
uneasy
DAVID
Hi

PETULIA
Did you get mama on the plane all right

DAVID

Sure But what a dinky plane Poor

mamats stomach problems are far from over

He enters the cabin Petulia sits up after a moment looks
about sees no one else then then in alarm peers into one
of the windows that looks down into the cabin

Ae¢

0 97B Continued

He uses the English way of saying vitamin and then a bit
too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window
Instinctively Petulia makes an effort to catch misses
and it hits her lightly on the shoulder Though it causes
no damage David is suddenly in terror He races up out
of the cabin to Petulia

97C EXT YACHT DAY

David rushes to Petulia Of course the orange did no damage
whatever but there is an abrupt tension between them He
flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange

DAVID
Papa went with her at the last minute
Petulia REACTS shocked

DAVID

(CONTINUING)

She was so pale and seared They arent
even pressurized The plane You suck
on a tube and hope its oxygen

s
During this he has peeled the orange and torn it into
segments which he now tries to feed her

DAVID
Open

PETULIA
How could he have gone Just like that

DAVID

Where mama is concerned papa is a very

loving man Open

nstead Petulia jumps frightened to her feet She seems
about to leave the yacht

The group goes off toward their yacht Petulia doesnt know
what to do David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into
the water The sun glints on his exquisite body Confusedly
Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth David
surfaces from the water laughing up at her He looks great

97D EXT YACHT NIGHT

Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht They
are dressed casually but very well David is completely
happy Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell shes frightened
out of her wits From the other yacht we still hear the
SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with

David is humming along with the music

PETULIA
We didnt have to come back this early

DAVID

Youre still not one hundred per cent

Theyve reached the cabin He enters She waits outside

His finger is pressed against the doorbell over which is

Petulia is standing there in Archies hooded sweatshirt

Her eyes widen in terror as David enters Archies apartment
She knows he has come here to kill her

to her and holds her hand in his very tightly Then he
leaves

10TH
99 INT HOSPITAL LOBBY

D

Archie feels unexpectedly giddy and carefree He
meets David carrying a silly sweet gift David
tenses for a show-down Archie impulsively flips out
Davids tie and continues on his way

100 EXTO HOSPITAL DAY

As Archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller
board almost kills him

He has an ice cream bar He sees three pretty girls

one with blonde hair like Petulias But its the
dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back
Archie watching the girl and eating his ice cream
leans against an electrical appliance shop window
Inside among endless other items is a single TV

tube on which the worlds violence flickers silently
and unnoticed as before

As we leave Archie we feel a sense of euphoria -- well
what do you know it all ended rather sweetly after all

101 INT DELIVERY ROOM

Petulia is looking up at the bright light on the
ceiling Two hands move toward her face holding an
ether mask The hands seem infinitely gentle One
hand touches Petulias face to reassure her

PETULIA

(in a whisper)
Archie
