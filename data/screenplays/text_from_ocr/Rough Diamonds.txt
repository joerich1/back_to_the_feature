INT MUSEUM —- DAY

A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS
glinting in the morning sun

Mounted on crushed velvet the identical diamonds are on a glass
covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast marble MUSEUM HALL

The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the
breathtaking beauty of the young woman whos admiring them MARIE
CLIFFORDs creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the
cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds

She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case Not to touch
the diamonds but to run her fingers over a picture thats mounted
in the case below the priceless jewels Its of a MOTHER cradling
her BABY DAUGHTER

MARIE
Todays the day Mom

CURATOR (0S)
You here again Marie

Marie spins round sees the bespectacled CURATOR 60s standing
behind her

MARIE
Just leaving

Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case

THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DIAMONDS

EXT MUSEUM - DAY

Marie fires up her powerful BMW parked right outside the austere
Museum building The powerful stereo blasts sending the birds
fluttering skywards

CREDITS appear over

ARIEL FOOTAGE of a narrow highway Maries BMW streaking through
the endless tract of Florida wetlands In the water GATORS warm
themselves in the early morning sun

MOVING over the vast tracts of swampland flocks of tropical BIRDS
stretch their majestic wings locals speed across the stagnant
waters in their deafening AIRBOATS

Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing

and into the town of Blue Bay where the niptucked denizens sip
three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club
Wild Things 3 03222004 2

Marie steers her BMW into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue
Bay High School

INT MARIES BMW - MORNING
Marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot when
SCCCREEEECCCHHHH

She SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car
Almost gives her a heart attack throwing her forward flailing
arms crashing into the stereo then snapped back by her seatbelt

She sits stock still for a second then looks up out of her
windshield at the young woman scouring at her only inches from
the front bumper of the BMW

The sudden jolt has changed the radio station A newscaster
rambles on

RADIO NEWSCASTER (VO)
- Operation aimed at finally capturing
the Black Widow suspect after a six month
trail of embezzlement and fraud once
again failed to snare its subject

ELENA SANDOVAL 17 stands defiantly in front of the BMW her
dont-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me
clothes

RADIO NEWSCASTER (VO)
Blue Bay Police Detective Michael
Morrison was able to recover over
400000 in stolen money but the
suspect described as Female between
eighteen and thirty remains at large

Marie reaches out with a trembling hand turns off the stereo
then leans out of the car window

MARIE
Im so sorry
Elena smiles wryly
ELENA

You will be

And she means it

INT BLUE BAY HIGH AUDITORIUM - MORNING

The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body The
natural order is clear the pastel flock at the front the meat
headed jocks in the center and the rejects at the back

Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends but shes still
shocked by what happened out in the parking lot

JENNY
(handing over a present)
Happy birthday babe They aint
diamonds but youre just gonna have to
wait for those

Marie tentatively opens the gift sees a pair of OPAL EARRINGS

MARIE
(unconvincing)
Thank you Thank you so much

JENNY
Are you OK hon

Marie looks back to the far reaches of the auditorium where the
freaks and geeks crowd round Elena worshipping her like the
Goddess she is

MARIE
IyeahIll be fineIts
justthat new girlI almost hit her
in the parking lot

JENNY
You mean the towel girl the one who
transferred in Jesus shes trouble You
know the only reason shes slinging
towels is ‘cos its court ordered

Marie and Elena make brief electric eye contact across the sea
of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER his
ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained steps onstage

MOSSTER
Were here today to address a growing
epidemic that affects all of you

He pauses waits for the student body to quiet down
MOSSTER

National studies report sexual activity
among students at an all-time high
Wild Things 3 03222004 4

The students all cheer naturally

MOSSTER
Well see whos cheering when youve got
an unwanted pregnancy on your hands or
get slapped with a paternity suitOr
arrested for date rape But dont take my
word for it

He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS early 30s a natural
beauty whos doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and
glasses and CHAD BORMAN late 20s devilishly handsome

PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
Miss Richards and Dr Borman are here to
tell you about the pitfalls first hand

Kristen steps up to the lectern

KRISTEN
Good morning my name is Kristen
Richards Im an officer for the Miami
juvenile parole board as some of you
already know

Quick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes

KRISTEN
But thats not what brings me here today
When I heard about Principal Mossters
sex education program I thought Id
volunteer my own personal story in hopes
that you might learn from the mistakes I
made Back in High school all I wanted to
do was get drunk stoned and laid

The students roar their approval
KRISTEN
By my junior year my life was a blur of
cheap beer anonymous sex partying every
night of the week
Elena covers her mouth as if to cough
ELENA
(through fake coughs)

-whore

Kristen ignores the slur
Wild Things 3 03222004 5

KRISTEN
And then one night at some pathetic frat
party someone slipped a roofie in my
drinkand raped me

This quiets the auditorium

KRISTEN
There isnt a day goes by my skin doesnt
crawl when I think of the violation and
humiliation I endured I can promise you
that if you make the same kind of wrong-
headed choices I did youll be seeing
Dr Borman

Chad steps to the podium

CHAD
Thank you Miss Richards My names Dr
Chad Borman I run the forensics lab at
the police department where my work has
helped convict hundreds of sex offenders
Most teens like Ms Richards never get
their lives together The physical scars
may go away but the emotional damage
stays forever

While Chad drones on MUDDY a Gremlin-eyed drooler sitting in
front of Elena looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up
on the back of the chair He spots the ugly plastic bracelet
locked around one of her ankles

MUDDY
Thats notwhat I think it is is it

ELENA
Whattchya think it is bitch

The words catch in his throat

MUDDY

One of themParole leashes
ELENA

Bingo
MUDDY

So you cant like go more than ten
miles from the cop shop

Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet
Wild Things 3 03222004 6

ELENA
Five I got someones panties in a bunch

Back at the podium Chad leans forward making sure his words
resonate with the student body

CHAD
And as for the perpetrators of this
heinous act even if you are stilla
minor you will be tried as an adult
and if convicted you will do hard time

He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students

CHAD
Are there any questions

ELENA
(calling out)
Yeah I got one for Miss Richards

KRISTEN
Ask away

ELENA
When they found the scumbag who took your
precious flower of virginity you sued
his sorry ass right

Kristen is taken aback by Elenas insensitivity stumbles over her
words finally spitting out the sad sorry truth

KRISTEN
Uh no actually I was never able to
make a positive ID All I remember was
his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in
my ear You wont remember but youll
never forget

Elena cracks a sideways grin
ELENA
So what youre really saying is you

fucked for free

Kristen has no answer to that Principal Mosster does his best to
control the situation

PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
Miss Sandoval Youre on thin ice young
lady

Like Elena cares She leans back nods Job done

EXT BLUE BAY HIGH DIVING POOL —- DAY

The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the
side of the massive diving pool where a diving meet is in full
swing

ANNOUNCER (VO)
Blue Bay High School would like to
welcome all participating diving teams
from the tri-county region

Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region in their
school colored bikinis are scattered around the pool area

But all eyes are on the home team Masturbatory fantasies abound
as the Blue Bay Girls Diving Team runs through stretches

And as exquisite as these girls are they pale in comparison to
absolutely sweet Marie stunning in her nearly see-through white
bathing suit

ANNOUNCER (VO)
First up district champion Marie
Clifford

The crowd cheers watching Marie edge out to the diving platform
twenty feet above Jenny right behind waits on the ladder

JAY CLIFFORD Maries chisel-jawed stepfather in his late
thirties focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front
row of the bleachers

JAY
Cmon now baby you can do it

Marie just rolls her eyes

JENNY
Your stepfathers just got a lot invested
in the team

Marie looks at her stepfather nods tentatively but then notices
the incongruous figure of Elena sidling up to him

JAY
(to Marie)
Just try to keep those legs together

ELENA (0S)
Shouldnt be a problem for Miss teen
Virgin
Wild Things 3 03222004 8

Jay looks round lowers the camera when he comes face to face with
the worlds hottest towel girl

JAY
Excuse me

ELENA
Youre Mr Clifford right As in
Clifford construction

JAY
I am yes but

ELENA
Id love to see one of your erections

Whoa Jays lost for words as he diverts his attention to the

platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into
the air

Its a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double
back flip entering the water with near-perfect form She quickly
resurfaces climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with
her teammates before crossing to Jay

JAY
Nice take off gotta work on the
landing

MARIE

I cant do any better
Jay shakes a finger at her silences her immediately
JAY

No such word as ‘cant Now do it again
Only better

Marie takes a deep breath approaches the ladder once more As
shes about to start the arduous climb Elena hands her a towel

ELENA
Bet you choke

Stops Marie in her tracks

MARIE
Whats your major malfunction

ELENA
Just wanted to make a wager Between best
friends
Wild Things 3 03222004 9

Marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform

ELENA
You blow this dive I get those diamonds
of yours

Marie stops looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the
ladder shakes her head

MARIE
Howd you know about my inheritance

ELENA
Talk of the town birthday girl Todays
the day right

MARIE
And what pray tell are you willing to
wager when I win

Elena thinks for a second glances back at Jay with a big smile

ELENA
Ill stay away from your stepfather You
make it I wont be your new stepmom
anytime soon Whattya say

Marie just stands there incredulous for a moment

MARIE
Take your sorry ass back to the swamps

She ascends the ladder leaving Elena behind

ELENA
Choke

Marie clambers up onto the high dive platform tries to focus on
the task at hand But cant help but notice her nemesis below
walking slowly seductively up to Jay intoxicating him

Marie blocks out the distraction concentrates at the task at
hand stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop
looming beyond

She slides a ring off her finger kisses it for luck Its an odd
design Four curved gold ridges just ready to hold a Diamond

She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her the gold glinting
in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water and a split
second before it breaks the surface Marie is airborne
Wild Things 3 03222004 10

She twists magnificently through the air a sight of breathtaking
beauty Thank God this is in slow motion

And as she gets ever closer to the waters surface she tucks
does one last back flip straightening out at the last possible
instant slicing through the water with nary a splash

Marie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE Treading water she cant help
but watch her Jays smiling face in the bleachers

EXT CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON

Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the
inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion

Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the
grounds Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun sip at non-

alcoholic punch and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch
of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland

Marie sits away from it all lost in thought as Jenny in cutoffs
and a bikini top sidles up beside her

JENNY
Whats the matter sweetie pissed that
one judge only gave you a 97

Marie forces a smile

MARIE
Nah Im cool

JENNY
Denial aint just a river in Egypt babe
You got diamonds on the mind

JAY (0S)
Have either of you seen my video camera

Marie looks round to her stepfather shakes her head bringing a
bemused look to Jays face

JAY
I had it at the dive meet Im sure

He shrugs picks up a crystal glass hits a fork sharply against
it drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers

JAY
Ladies Gentlemen friends raise a glass
to Marie on her eighteenth birthday

Everyone raises their fine crystal
Wild Things 3 03222004 11

JAY
Shes become every inch of the woman her
Mother hoped shed be Wherever she is
now Julies looking down and smiling

Tears well in Maries eyes

JAY
And thats why on your eighteenth
birthday Marie I know your mother
wanted you to have

He notices out of the corner of his eyes two well-dressed MEN
standing at the entrance to his house Whoever they are Jays
instantly unnerved He stumbles over his words

JAY
-- She wanted you to have a wonderful
birthday party surrounded by all your

friends
He glances back toward the house watching the two men enter

JAY
Please excuse me

-- and hurries after them Marie is left dumbfounded So close
but so far

MARIE
Jay What about my present

She chases after him

INT CLIFFORD MANSION HALLWAY —- DAY

Marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the
opulent Clifford Mansion past framed family photos of Jay Marie

and the late Julie

MARIE
Jay

Hes nowhere to be found Frustrated Marie finds herself alone in
the kitchen She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne pops the
cork Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices

JAY (0S)
It simply cant be done

Marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen back into the hallway
and down towards Jays study
Wild Things 3 03222004 12

JAY (0S) (CONTD)
In all construction theres delays

Marie sidles up to the door jam peaks through the crack What she
sees makes the blood run cold in her veins

An imposing Cuban businessman MR BARAJAS stands threateningly
over a visibly frightened Jay Another man CICATRIZ dressed in
designer silks stands menacingly in the corner clearly the brawn
of this little operation

MR BARAJAS
Four months is not a delay Its a
disaster

JAY
You have my word Mr Barajas the
building is almost finished Just give me
a week two tops

Barajas nods to Cicatriz who moves in on Jay with lightning
quickness holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb

MR BARAJAS
We are long past the negotiation stage

Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jays thumb Marie has to
cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood
stain the spotless white carpet

MR BARAJAS (CONTD)
For every day the building goes
unfinished well take a finger

A sinister grin stretches across Cicatrizs lips

CICATRIZ
Pray Mr Clifford you finish before the
eleventh day

And with that the Cuban men head to the door Marie scrambles
away her heart pounding

Shes halfway down the hallway when Mr Barajas and Cicatriz exit
Jays study She turns tries to look innocent as the Cuban
‘businessmen’ stare her down

Jay appears in the doorway sweat cascading from his brow
JAY

Marie Shouldnt you be with your
friends
Wild Things 3 03222004 13

MARIE
I was just

Cicatriz takes a step towards her

JAY
(to Marie)
Ill be right there With your gift
just wait outside OK

Marie backs away never taking her eyes off the intimidating Cuban
men

EXT CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON

Marie stumbles down the lawns past the semi-clad partygoers ina
daze as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne

Jenny and the dive team wait by the dock and welcome their lost
sheep with open arms

JENNY
So Did you get the key Are you Blue
Bays richest bitch

Maries thoughts are drowned out by the ROAR of a powerful engine
All attention turns to a rusted MOTORCYCLE as it streaks across
the verdant lawns leaving a spray of MUD in its wake

And atop the bike Elena in skintight leathers

JENNY
Holy shit who invited her

Maries slightly drunken eyes narrow Elena brings the bike to a
screeching halt inches from the surprised guests The ultimate
partycrasher

MARIE
This is a private party

ELENA
Dont mind me I aint here for your
stupid party

Shes striding towards the Mansion towards Jay whos standing at
the patio doors an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands

MARIE
Get the hell outta here NOW

Marie stumbles after Elena grabbing her from behind holding her
back Theres a tense moment before
Wild Things 3 03222004 14

ELENA
Damn girl whattcha been drinking

MARIE
Stay away from my stepfather

ELENA
Make me

And thats it Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch Connects on
Elenas jaw and she goes reeling back But its ignited the street
fighter in her and she comes roaring back into the fray ramming
into Marie and together they tumble to the ground

The crowds gather to watch the cat-fight in equal parts appalled

and aroused Its a hair pulling teeth gnashing make up smearing
wrestling match no holds barred The drunken Marie has the upper

hand the alcohol fueling her rage

JAY (0S)
What the hells going on here

And that stops the fight right there and then Marie looks up to
see a red faced Jay standing over her

MARIE
Thistrash is just looking for a meal
ticket
Elena gets to her feet licks the blood from her split lip
ELENA
Mr Clifford Betcha proud of little
Marie now huh

He hauls Marie to her feet thrusts her towards the mansion

JAY
Partys over

Groans from the crowd but Jays mind is made up

MARIE
Butwhat aboutmy present

Jays already walking away
JAY

Elena watches Jay stride away like a lioness stalking her prey

EXT TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING SITE - NIGHT

Work lights illuminate the half finished condo building site on
prime beachfront real estate These places would sell for
millions if they were ever finished

INT TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING OFFICE - NIGHT

In a concrete makeshift office on the top floor of the condo
building Jay clicks open the lock on his large metal safe and the
steel door swings open

Inside are stacks of CASH piled high along with a shiny new
HANDGUN Jay flicks through the money shaking his head

JAY
(sotto)
Not enough Just not enough

A clanking noise from outside has him quickly snatching the gun
from the safe before closing it once more spinning the lock

INT TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Jay walks out of his office into the half-finished top floor of
the condos Exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind
schedule Jay really is

JAY
Hello Anyone there

He swings the gun round impotently seeing nothing in the
flickering florescent light

Finally Jay lowers the weapon It looks like he might collapse
until he catches himself palms flat against the wall head down

JAY (CONTD)
Fuck me

ELENA (0S)
Any time Any place

He reels around sees Elena moving toward him brushing aside the
thick plastic sheeting She has a bottle of beer in one hand a
video camera in the other Jays video camera to be precise

JAY
What are you doing here

ELENA
You promised to show me your erection
Wild Things 3 03222004 16

Elena focuses the video camera on Jays crotch Makes him
incredibly uncomfortable obviously

JAY

Elena thrusts the bottle of beer at Jay

ELENA
Lighten up Jay

Jay takes the bottle from her sets it down on the concrete floor
JAY
Enoughs enough I think its time you

This brings a teasing pout to Elenas lips

ELENA
Is that any way to treat Maries new best

Jays taken aback
JAY

Youre best friends are you

ELENA
Sure Weve been having sleepovers
Talking about boys swapping tips Shes

Jays taken aback once more How much more aback can he be taken
He reaches out and blocks the video camera lens

JAY
Gimme the camera back

Elena saunters slowly past brushing up against him Keeps the
camera trained on his worried face

ELENA
Come get it

Jays reaching his elastic limit He reaches for the camera but
Elena wont let go They wrestle for control of the video camera
And finally the camera slips from both their grasps flies across
the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor
Wild Things 3 03222004 17

ELENA

Ooopppps

Elena runs her finger under Jays chin then turns and walks away
leaving Jay standing there all taken aback

She reaches for the car door handle but comes up short When she
looks back up shes in for some taking aback of her own

Elena comes walking out of the building site and the two girls

satisfied smile and walks away

FADE TO BLACK
INT MUSEUM - MORNING

A perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother
Daughter DIAMONDS glinting in the morning sun

Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically
in the dark marble museum hall reaching out a trembling hand
towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels

JAY (0S)
You really think youre ready for your
inheritance

Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum still in
the same clothes as yesterday

MARIE
It wasit was what Mom wanted

Jay looks at her sternly

JAY

Jay shakes his head slowly deliberately

JAY

INT BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM —- DAY

Elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger She
stops in front of the two way mirror examines her reflection

Tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab
on her lip covering the wound Marie inflicted at the party And
slowly Elena starts to press on the cut until the blood starts to
flow once more

Theres a quiet knock on the door and Elena quickly lowers her
hand looks round

Kristen Richards the young Parole Officer who so heart
wrenchingly told her story at Blue Bay High earlier comes quietly
into the gray room

KRISTEN

Elena just looks up at her pitifully

KRISTEN

Through stifled sobs Elena states

ELENA

Yes they do

DA MEESE
Do they show that it was forced
Wild Things 3 03222004 28

protection This is quite common in cases
of premeditated rape

date rape drug Traces were also found on
the bottle of beer at the crime scene

Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface illuminating Maries
lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until

Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water plucks the
soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool

EXT BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL —- DAY

Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool She places the ring onto
the deck pulls herself out of the water

She tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with
Kristen whos picked up her ring runs it around her fingers

MARIE
Can I help you

KRISTEN
I was wondering if I could have a moment
of your time Ask a couple questions

Marie glances nervously back at the pool where other members of
the diving team go about their workout

MARIE
Im in the middle of practice

KRISTEN
Itll only take a moment Marie Might
even help Jay Remember your loving
stepfather You want to help him dont
you

MARIE
Of course
Wild Things 3 03222004

Kristen studies the ring for a moment then ventures

KRISTEN
Whyd you agree to part with your
diamonds

This time Marie cant hide her shock

MARIE
How

KRISTEN
Jay told me But why They were your
inheritance

MARIE
Jay needed help Were a team

KRISTEN
Team Clifford Right Its justYou
mustve been pretty unhappy when Jay
didnt give you those diamonds for your
birthday

He said I wasnt ready

KRISTEN

never let you have them

MARIE
No of course not

KRISTEN
And then this little scam artist saunters
in and just takes them With your help

Elena do what Jay asked clear his name
After all shed gotten what she wanted

MARIE
How should I know

Maries taking a beating doing her best to remain standing
Wild Things 3 03222004 53

Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the
ring against the back of her hand Hard Winces then

KRISTEN
I mean the only way I can make sense of
it is if somehow getting Jay released
from prison would spoil the plan

MARIE
What plan

She hands the ring back to Marie Not so lucky anymore

KRISTEN

EXT SWAMP —- DAY

Chads face is drained of color as he runs through the dense
swampland hugging the priceless diamonds Sweat cascades from his
brow and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body
swirl in the stagnant waters

Most gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right
leg As the water gets knee-deep the last of Chads reserve
energy goes He collapses in the stagnant marsh

Not far off GATORS circle Its only a matter of time before they
notice the blood in the water
Wild Things 3 03222004 63

EXT EVERGLADES —- DAY

Marie heads off in the opposite direction Elena hesitates wants
to follow but does as shes told and goes left soon enveloped
by canopy of trees

the midst of the swamp

Elena stumbles through the thick stagnant water scouring the
horizon for any sign of Chad

HER DOWN INTO THE SWAMP

EXT EVERGLADES - DAY

Elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water gasps for
breath Looking down she sees Chad holding on to her like his

life depends on it It does

He pulls her back down into the water just as she catches a
glance of the circling GATORS

Using her as leverage Chad pulls himself out of the swamp
climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid
ground

Elena coughs and splutters floundering in the blood soaked water
The ravenous Gators approach sensing a feeding frenzy

CHAD
Dont move Dont splash they can sense
you in the water theyll rip you to
pieces

Elena freezes looking round at the black eyes breaking the
surface of the bloody water gliding in for the kill

ELENA
Helhelp me

She reaches out a hand to Chad only a few feet away
He hesitates then reaches out to her But stops short of grabbing
her trembling hand Just balls his fist squeezing every last drop

of blood out of the open wounds on his palm

The dark blood cascades down into the water around Elena
Wild Things 3 03222004 65

CHAD
No

And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws
WHACK

Chads eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose
ears and mouth He falls forward stiff as a board and SPLASHES
down into the water next to an apoplectic Elena Behind him stands
Marie the BLOODY TIRE IRON in hand

Marie reaches out a hand pulls Elena out of the water She
collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air

MARIE
What are you doing Our diamonds are
about to become dinner

Elena cant move leaving Marie to wade into the swamp
EXT SWAMP ROAD - DAY

Kristen approaches a fork in the swamp road at high speed She
checks the GPS scanner It doesnt show her which way to turn

Which way which way

Split second decision Left She spins the wheel takes the left
hand fork

Bad choice Just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned
BMW an idle airboat a crashed car one dead man and two wild
wild things

EXT SWAMP ROAD —- DAY

Elena and Marie soaked to the bone drag Chads cold dead corpse
out of the trees Marie drops the body heads straight for her
abandoned BMW Elena follows stumbling through the vines her
clothes dripping wet shivering more from nerves than cold

ELENA

MARIE

Marie spins round a vicious look in her eyes She holds the blood
soaked diamonds in her hand

MARIE
Chad made us an appointment to sell

Elena looks down to her flashing ankle bracelet

ELENA
Its only a matter of time before my
Parole Officer finds me

Marie turns back around flings open the BMW door and gets in

MARIE
Then I suggest you get to work

She fires up the powerful engine speeds away in a cloud of dust
leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life

EXT CHADS CRASHED CAR - AFTERNOON

Elena struggles to drag Chads bloody body back to his crashed
car The tail lights flicker throwing an ominous red glow over
the dense thicket of overhanging trees

ELENA
(sotto)
Jesus

With a Herculean effort she manages to stuff Chads inert body
into the drivers seat She stumbles back horrified at the grim
tableau before her

EXT MUSEUM - AFTERNOON

Maries car comes barreling into the parking lot outside the stone
Museum building

INT MUSEUM —- AFTERNOON

The Curator paces back and forth like an expectant father in
front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds
Marie bursts into the Museum and he strides up to meet her
shocked when he sees Maries covered in blood sweat and guilt

CURATOR
Marie Are you alright
Wild Things 3 03222004 67

The Curator nods nervously

CURATOR

She fishes in her bag for the diamonds

CURATOR

‘associate’ He said he would be handling
the transaction

MARIE

Marie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag
thrusts them at the Curator He screws up his wrinkled face
afraid to touch them

MARIE
Calm down Its just blood

EXT CHADS CAR - AFTERNOON

With trembling hands Elena opens the trunk of Chads crashed car
She pulls out a plastic gas container sloshing the fuel around
inside then trailing it back across the vine covered ground

She carefully places the empty container down standing twenty
feet back from the wreckage fumbling in her pocket for a match

She can barely control her hands her whole body shaking in
fear

Finally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK still sopping wet from the
swamp She strikes match after match but they wont light until
finally one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then
smoulders out

ELENA
Dont do this to me please
Wild Things 3 03222004 68

In frustration she runs back to Chads car looking desperately
for a lighter climbing all the way in Because of the slight
slope its on the cars flimsy door slams shut behind her

Elena pays no heed continues to rummage through the glove
compartment

ELENA
You gotta have a lighter or some

Shes cut off as the WRECKED CARS HORN BLARES OUT
Deafening the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth Elenas
heart skips a beat Chads corpse has slumped forward against the

steering wheel

ELENA
Jesus

She struggles with all her might to pull Chads body back off the
horn

Silence reigns once more Elena takes short sharp breaths Looks
over at Chads body slumped to the side leaning against the
drivers side door

ELENA
Im sorry Im so sorry

Not as sorry as shes going to be

The match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to
smoulder for a second then REIGNITES

over in his hands Marie stands over him impatiently tapping her

muddy shoe on the marble floor

ground and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of
gasoline that Elena trailed from Chads wrecked car

FIRE racing towards the car shes trapped in

She reaches over clawing her way past Chads corpse trying to
reach the door lock Her bloody fingers slip on the lock unable

to pull it up

empty diamond exhibit case runs her fingers over the portrait of

behind a pillar Her shirt GLOWS her eyes like beacons

hyperventilating as more gunshots EXPLODE She clutches Morrisons
shotgun to her chest getting closer to the top floor

shields herself as plaster rains down on her unable to see
through the cloud of dust under the UV lights until

to see the barrel of Jays gun Maries face is contorted
maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger

Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening GUN SHOT
rings out Followed by SCREAMS He rips open the fourth floor fire
door tearing through the building pushing through thick plastic
sheeting until he finds himself under the UV glow

Thick plumes of blood black under the UV light stain the walls
and floor He sees Elena in a fetal ball trembling
uncontrollably

Beside her Marie lies dead her chest a gaping crimson mess
Jays gun still clutched tightly in her cold dead hands

Kristen looks up at him almost too shocked to speak Morrisons
shotgun is still smoking in her hands

regain his balance Its too late He falls 20 feet to the
