FADE IN

EXT STREET - SUMMER NIGHT 1

Romantic night - and now moving into camera the couple to
prove it LISA a really pretty 27 year old woman who has
made every sacrifice of mind body and spirit in order not to
feel the way she does at this moment self-conscious and
threatened by a vague set of ordinary emotions which worst
of all to her serve no constructive purpose whatsoever
Still here she is after a lifetime unafraid of anything
with fear poking secretly away at her while her date Matty
(a “hunk” who is frequently mistaken for a “catch”) is in the
background causing a small flurry of excitement signing an
autograph He looks and sees her failing to make the turn to
his building

MATTY
(calling out)
Left

Lisa bobbles with distraction and then makes the turn She is
quickly ensnared by her persistent troubling thoughts

ON Matty

As he looks at her and grins with impulse and a veteran’s

sense of mischief based on deep appreciation of the night
her swirling skirt and the promise of simple pleasures He
comes up behind her ear and responds to her yelp with the

absolute truth

MATTY
Nights so great You look so good
Just need to grab you

LISA
HuhSorry I didn’t

But that quick he has lifted and swirled her Then maybe as
she was just getting into the ride drops her

MATTY
Were here

He gestures with his head to a nearby apartment building the
best apartment building in town

EXT APT BLDG - NIGHT 2

He walks toward the front door - the doorman greets him by
nameLisa hesitates ambivalent not her usual decisive
self

LISA
HeyMattyI may have to go back
on what I said about finally seeing
your place tonighttheres a lot
on my mind right now and

Matty unaccustomed to even minor adversity has a flash of
well not depression a flash of not feeling fantastic

MATTY
You sure

LISA
(light half
laughing honest)
Well no

MATTY
(cowboy justice)
No pressure here It should feel
right

His John Wayne moral center impresses Lisa but then he takes
several steps back

LISA
That’s nice Thanks Why are you
moving away

MATTY
Give you room to think and decide

The doorman also backs off a few spaces Lisa looks at the
two men staring at her

MATTY
Take your time I get a kick out of
watching you make up your mind

He means it He is having a good time giving her space and
enjoying the mystery She moves forward toward the door

WHITE DRAFT 52909 3

LISA
You have all the signs of a
handful

MATTY
Hope so

She takes a swing at him a solid fist and perfectly balanced
are to his stomachshe is surprised by her own action

INT ELEVATOR - NIGHT 3

LISA
Im sorry did I hurt you

MATTY
Just got me more interested

He kisses her

INT MATTYS APT - BEDROOM - MORNING 4
Thig is a truly expensive apartment -- we are now in the
bedroom where there are a great many trophies in evidence
besides our Lisa who now lies next to her spanking new lover
having more than held up her end of the just concluded
lengthy and athletic night of love making She can’t
however quite match his grin Matty’s in a state of some
wonder - celebrating the fact that his expectations have been
exceeded

MATTY
AmazingFemale jocks are amazing

LISA
(a level look)
Could you personalize it a little

Matty cracks up

MATTY
(enthusiastically)
Right right right 1 meant it as
tribute to you Lisa Jorgenson
Come on it was amazing huh That
was unbelievable

LISA
Fishing for a compliment

WHITE DRAFT 52909 4

MATTY
(exuberant)
Im fishing for a celebration

LISA
I have to get going

She scoops up her clothes and groans over how wrinkled her
dress is as she moves toward the bathroom We move with her --
perhaps noting perfect long smooth muscles in her arms and
legs

MATTY
(oc)
There’s a fresh toothbrush in the
right hand drawer

INT MATTY’S APT - BATHROOM - DAY 5

She stands in front of the sink now and opens the right hand
drawer

ANGLE ON DRAWER

Two dozen unused toothbrushes lined up -- all in unbroken
glass containers She takes this in then breaks open the
container and is brushing her teeth when there is a knock
on the doorShe opens it

MATTY
You don’t have to wear that dress
home

He moves past her and opens a cabinet where there is a stack
of unopened women’s sweats

MATTY
Medium

He hands her a package She reacts with extreme distaste

MATTY
What

LISA
The stack is a little ---
repulsively unromantic

MATTY
No its not It’s classy Im being
a good host here

WHITE DRAFT 52909 5

LISA
Its like I’m on an assembly line
spitting out girls

MATTY
Thats just negative Aren’t we all
on an assembly line - going through
each others lives until one day we
close down the factory take home a
product and use it monogamously for
the rest of our lives

She starts putting on her dress

LISA
Matty my mistakeforget about it

MATTY
If I hid the rest and gave you one
Id be a great guy but because I
am open with you

She moves past him heading for the front door

LISA
Just forget it

MATTY (CONT’D)
Too bad

CAMERA MOVES AHEAD OF THEM

INT MATTY’S APT - HALLWAY BEDROOM 6

This is purposefully a traditional romantic vignette of hurt
woman with a backbone about to express herself with
forceful exitits why doors were made to slam

And then that quick she catches herself - holding the door in
pre-slam wind-up then turns toward him genuinely apologetic

LISA

Hey MattyWhat am I doing I know
better “Don’t judge anybody
before you check yourself out
Youre lucky when it’s your fault
because then you can correct the
situation”

(working it out as if with

a friend)

WHITE DRAFT 52909 6

LISA (cont d)

Im nervous over something and a
little worried so I ended up with

an attractive guy who youd have to
be an idiot to mistake for serious
materialfor anything but a fun
friendship -- and rather than
accept the evening as a chance to
hide out from myself with some
really amazing sex I start to give
him a hard time for just being who
he ig I really apologize Please
forgive me

MATTY
You may be my “dream girl”

She grabs her panties and exits

LISA
You take care

MATTY
What are you worried about
anyways

LISA
(forcefully)
Nothing I can’t believe Im
whining about it Crap

As she turns away

EXT STREET - DAY 7

Lisa -- wrinkled dress -- stops -- takes running shoes from
her purse and puts them onShe then moves purposefully her
walk arresting in its precision and powerpassing
peopleshe is in a hurry

INT SUBWAY - DAY 8
Liga standing -- her face tight
EXT MIDDLE CLASS STREET - NEAR LISAS APT - DAY 9

As Lisa moves down a lower middle class block to her apt

WHITE DRAFT 52909 7

INT APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY 10

As she stops at the foot of the stairs to open a compartment
and withdraw a weighted vest which she puts onand then
begins to hop up the stairs two at a timeIts a hell of a
stuntas hard as it looks and this image of athlete
straining while wearing a hopelessly wrinkled party dress is
strangely a very appropriate image for what awaits her

INT LISA’S APT - DAY 11

Easily as many trophies as Matty (including two Olympic gold
medals)inevitable rows of team pictures she cares about
team (Note how they are displayed is a project for us)
Furniture is very basicone of those L shaped rooms with the
bend of the “L” considered the bedroom -- pullout sofa She
walks directly to a desk on which sits her computer

CLOSE ON COMPUTER

Lisa pauses over the keys She sniffs the air oxygen her
long time elixir She does not touch the keys instead moving
off and leaving the scene We hear the shower start

INT LISAS APT - CLOSE ON LISA - A BIT LATER 12

As she sits again at the computer Here’s the thing about
this moment In the truest sense of the word we are
witnessing an act of private bravery Lisas life as she
knows it and has lived it is on the line Yet the signs are
small as she weighs her dicey options for survival

CLOSE ON COMPUTER

As Lisa hits the site of the “UNITED STATES NATIONAL SOFTBALL
ASSOCIATION” She clicks on “NEW ROSTER OF PLAYERS” And then
reads “THIS YEAR’S ROSTER IS DELAYED”

ON LISA

She is struck by foreboding and simultaneously beats the
feeling back Her fingers take actionshe clicks her way to
on-line ticketing and confirms “least expensive” trip to
Phoenix A cute tone confirms she has scored for a ticket

WHITE DRAFT 52909 8

EXT NATIONAL TEAM ATHLETIC COMPLEX - TRACKING WITH LISA 13

It is off-season but there are college athietes and national
players working on some drills which look enormously hard to
do When the players spot Lisa they stop immediately a
subtle flurry of hero worship ensues She exchanges a deep
hug with one or two of her teammates

INT ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT - WOMEN’S WING - EDIT BAY - DAY 14

This is the home of champions Olympic memorabilia in
evidence NCAA Champion cups etc She is drawn to one
crowded editing bin cubicle where coaches and a few athletic
tech support persons watch a television set in a darkened
area As she passes SALLY an assistant coach (late 30’s-
early 40s -- clearly athletic looking) calls to her

SALLY
Heymy fave What are you doing
here I didn’t think I’d see you
till the Jersey clinic Were just
editing the promotional video
(to student editor)
Show her part

Lisa indicates shed rather notSally gestures forcefully
that she should see it

LISA
Just for a minute

Before the student editor scrolls the images Lisa is there
sticking out her hand

LISA
Lisa Jorgenson

The student is flattered and gives her name Jane

LISA
Good to meet you

Lisa retreats to the background We alternate between THE
MONITOR and Lisa who is a little self-conscious being eyed
by others as she witnesses her own past glories

ON MONITOR

WHITE DRAFT 52909 9

ANNOUNCER
Co-captain and second baseman Lisa
Jorgenson - ended Australia’s
vallyand secures the cup The
United States wins its 7th world
championship

We see a montage of Lisa’s steller play in this game ending
with a backdoor slide scoring the winning run after which
she roars in competitive exultation at the opposing catcher

ANNOUNCER
(horribly fake chuckle)
Captain Jorgenson is the mother hen
of the celebration

VARIOUS SHOTSLisa making sure everyone is taken care
ofshe stops one of the players from taking off her shirt
ala Brandy Chastain she is also trying to gather her
teammates to shake hands with the Australian team she
herself providing spirited consolation to the Australian
girls simultaneously fighting off her own teammates who are
trying to lift her on their shoulders and somehow getting
them to lift the coach insteadwe additionally see her
lifting Sally--a tearful moment for each

ON LISA
Strangely turned shy by the feelings evoked Enough

LISA
Enough

On the video the stars and stripes are raised She
successfully fights off emotion but comment is required

LISA
Whew

As Lisa prepares to leave the room

SALLY
Did coach call you here

LISA
Nope Just thought I should speak
to him while it could still maybe
do some good

INT ATHLETIC DEPT HALLWAYCOACHS OFFICE - DAY 15

Sally follows her into the hallway

SALLY
WowThe roster’s never been this

LISA
I was in the top box of his
triangle of success chart in 17 of
the 19 categories

SALLY
Well oh my God then so why You

LISA

more liketruth than nervous crap

SALLY
Well hell -- go in Find out for

beer

Lisa nodsand walks toward the office The nameplate next
to the door reads “WILLIAM SMITH Head Coach” Sally can’t

resist getting in her ear to render last minute coaching when
she sees Lisa tense

SALLY
(sotto)
Confident confident relaxed
confident You are the best

Sally peals off and Lisa pauses a beat It’s game face time

INT COACH SMITH’S OFFICE - DAY 16

She enters the coach’s office overplaying her sense of
security and confidence by a mile or so

LISA
Hey coach Hows it going

WILLIAM SMITH is a good looking guy who excels at pushing and
manipulating others He is surprised to see Lisa

COACH SMITH
Hey you What’s doing

WHITE DRAFT 52909 11

LISA

COACH SMITH
Sure

LISA
Ive been following the training
guide you sent but doing two a days

She exits

INT AIRPLANE - DAY 17

As she sits in a full plane returning to Washington
DCopens an old play book -- she is Yacting” as if she
were untroubled even though no one is watching

Lisa working out with several girls from the national
teamShe is fielding hot fungoes ina circle with
teammates1little gruntssmall off-camera utterances as
they encourage each otherLisa’s phone starts to ring -- she
hears the distinctive music turns and not seeing the ball
coming at her takes one hard on the face She has a bloody
lipThe injury is close to an absolute non-event for her
She spits some blood with enviable expertise as she walks to
her bag on the sidelines

LISA
It better be worth it

INT OFFICE - DAY 19

GEORGE MADISON in his mid 30’s If anyone faults him as
colorless it is because they have never paused on a foggy
morning to consider the vibrancy of grey He is solid
solidly educated solid in thought and deed and carry
through And of course so many mentions of the word “solid”
portends that he will soon break apart from the intensity of
some serial misfortunes which will make it forever impossible
(as a character will soon remark) to ever again be the person
he is at this moment

GEORGE
Hi

(checks a piece of paper)
Lisa This is George Madison Did
Riva tell you that she gave me your
number

LISA
No
GEORGE

She said it might be a good idea
for us to have dinner together

LISA
Ohwell let me call herwhen
did you have in mind

GEORGE
No I wasn’t calling to set a time
She didn’t know I was seeing

someone -- well she didn’t know
that it had escalated a bit at
least on my part -- it just added

up for me suddenly and
(catching himself at
giving too much
information)

Well anyway

Lisa seizes on the fun of his oddnessshe grins blood from
the hit on her lip covering her front teeth

LISA
80 youre calling me to break
up

Her teammates gather around on hearing this -- she grins a
bloody grin and gestures that the call is off the charts
goofy So much so she is enjoying herself
WHITE DRAFT 52909 13

GEORGE
I just didnt think

A woman enters his office with George’s secretary ANNIE a
few steps behind trying to stop herthey are briefly out of
focus as we remain concentrated on the phone call as George
attempts to do the same

WOMAN
George Madison

He nods - but indicates he has a call to complete Annie
gives a short hand whispered message

ANNIE
She justthe rudeness

George nods pats the distraught Annie on the back

GEORGE
(into phone)
I’m sorryI got distracted What
was I saying

LISA
“you just didnt think”

GEORGE
Rightthank you
(to Annie)
Thank you

The woman is surprised unaccustomed to being thanked

WOMAN
(ironically)
Youre welcome

She exits

GEORGE
(into phone)
Thank you for holdingI just
didn’t think it was right not to
phone you once I took your number
in case she had talked to you and
you were expecting my call

LISA
Uh-huh Okay thenIt was nice of
you to call in a way I guess

WHITE DRAFT 52909 14

GEORGE
Right Sorry for interrupting your
day
LISA
Yeah
GEORGE
Goodbye

He hangs up and mutters to himselfunconscious to the fact
that he is doing so

GEORGE
CouldIhavesoundedstranger

He looks down at the folder for the first time

GEORGE
Oh my God

INT UNIVERSITY HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 20

As a class breaks the students (grad students) flow

messageWe read it

GEORGES TEXT MESSAGE

should be folded in as well Ill

He finishes and looks off into space and shudders suddenly
and unexpectedly registers surprise It’s a first He has
never shuddered before Now the Physics professor comes into
view This is TERRY DREISER she is in the argument for the
smartest woman alive - a physicist whose mind holds the
promise of one day explaining it all to us She is surprised
to see him

TERRY

She holds up the portable data plug which contains all her
work

WHITE DRAFT 52909 1s

GEORGE
Yeah you didI justI’m not
going to stay around

INT CRAMPED ACADEMIC OFFICE - DAY 21

As they enter --- her work is all laid out for her A
waiting work cocoon of perfect reading light bookstwo
computers and many many stacks of researchShe must move
sideways to get into the cramped work area where she puts
HER DATA PLUG into its computer port and the screen comes
alive with physicswords and computations

TERRY
Maybe that’s better for tonight T
don‘t know why I agreed to this
delivery datedamn me and my need
for approval Sorry

She slides into the cocoon -- no small feat

GEORGE
Sure It was nice seeing your face
for a minute Settles me down

TERRY

thats bothering you

George is puzzled by this

TERRY

(crossing to him)
If youre concerned about us now
that weve intensifiedwe’re okay
I am busy so I can’t demonstrate to
you that were okay in all the
little ways like paying attention
to youbut if you could just take
my word for it until the work lets

up that would really help me and
us
(beguiling)
I think I like that word better
Us
GEORGE
Ok
TERRY

Thanks Kiss

WHITE DRAFT 52909 16

She slides out with some difficulty -He kisses her

TERRY
Hot kiss

He hot kisses her She moans pulls him closer with a long
legTerry has the ability to get instantly hot and when
her very plump brain cells get that blood flow insights
result

TERRY
(hot and free)
Dont let me get away with too much
- that will never work for me -
dont be too low maintenance that’s
a ticking bomb but thanks for
understanding this one

George is getting aroused but not for long She breaks
off

TERRY
See We’re good

He nods and exits as she turns back to her work then turns
realizing a beat late that her turn-on and sudden turn-off
was sort of funnystrangeshe flashes a good guy smile and
shrugs

EXT GREAT CAMPUS - DAY 22

As George walks off -- he moves past an outdoor job fair
where dozens of corporations are interviewing soon to be
MBA’s potential employees an assembly line where the biggest
start to package the best

EXT RUNNING AREA - NATIONAL MALL - EARLY MORNING 23

A foot race in progressLisa pounding the composite surface
alongside a girl RIVA maybe eight years younger Lisa even
while running remembers something suddenly

LISA
(gasping)
Gotta talk to you after

RIVA
(gasping less)
Ill wait for you at the finish

WHITE DRAFT 52909 17

LISA
Sense of humor

She turns it on and it is fiercely competitive -- “full out”
as few experience the term Riva wins barely CAMERA REMAINS
LOOKING STRAIGHT UP THE TRACK as each of the women goes to a
different side of frame to heave It is a common occurrence

EXT OUTDOOR AREA - DAY 24

The two women have just ordered breakfast

LISA
So You gave my number to a guy

RIVA
Yeah I hardly know himhe went to
business school with my brother

LISA
How come you gave him my number
anyway

RIVA

You don’t remember Wednesday night --
you said you had never dated a non-
athlete and maybe you should try

one

LISA
I did

RIVA
Yeah

LISA

Don’t listen to me when I’m
drinking Guiness

RIVA
It’s the only time you really say
stuff

LISA

(briefly worried)
I hope thats not true

INT GEORGES OFFICE - DAY 25

George is seated at a side chaix Annie opens the door and
is quickly shoved aside by Georges father CHARLES vibrant
with an energy which leaves no doubt he came up through sales
and RON the company’s legal counsel who seems to squirt
Protestant genes as he walks with perfect posture

GEORGE

Good morning Dad
CHARLES

You said bring the company

lawyer

George hands his father the subpoenaRon reads over Charles’
shoulder They each react instantly -- simultaneously
shakenCharles doesn’t trust himself to speakhe hands the
paper to Ron and paces off

RON
(to Charles)
They are apparently investigating
us for possible misstatement of
receivables to inflate earnings

CHARLES
What do you know about this

GEORGE
Nothing But I’m responsible

CHARLES
What are you being noble

GEORGE
Im telling you what all recent
legislation says If it’s true and
I didnt know I should have

CHARLES
The goddamn government’s become
like this horrible punishing

Mommy

RON
Could you ask your assistant to
come in -- we’re going to have to

respond immediately
WHITE DRAFT 52909 19

GEORGE
Excuse me Anniecould you please
come on in and bring your laptop

annie enters and looks at George -- worried about him She

has worked for him for some time She adores him Ron is
clearly grave

RON
All these items mentioned -- you
must have checked whether we had
actual receipt of funds before we
talked to the analysts

GEORGE
Nomost of them came from Dads
office so I assumed

His father makes a strangled half-bark of a noise and George
glances at him

CHARLES
You don’t assume or trust anyone
not himcertainly not me

RON
Good guidelines I’m afraid

GEORGE
(continuing)
with everyone working creatively
on the new line I thought I’d wait
until

Another noise from Dad Annie stands just behind him -- she

le to conceal the concerns and emotions born of her
ferocious loyalty to George

GEORGE
Just a second Dad There’s an
overall involved here My approach
is different than yours was which
I tried to make clear when I took
over And it’s to get finance and
legal out of the way of the
creative

Charles makes a disparaging noise then

CHARLES
(about to take over)
Okay now
--was

WHITE DRAFT 52909 20

GEORGE
(softly but firm)
Let me finish please

CHARLES
No Drivel doesn’t get to finish
Drivel gets interrupted

George continues nonetheless His earnestness is palpable
and given his audience ill advised

GEORGE
Soshaping the corporate culture
may not bring results as quickly on
the income statement as just
eliminating jobs and wacking
expenses But with patience it
will work and when it does youve
built something

CHARLES
(shouting)
You are a fucking moron
(catching himself)
Too rough

RON
Much too rough

GEORGE
Don’t use that language in front of
Annie

CHARLES

Okay I caught myself Now may I
get back to the fucking sorry
Annie the fucking sorry again
Anniepoint

(to George)
You talk “creativity” to me You
MBACPA You are a numbers
man You have one job you are
suited for and that’s to be
practical pig and make sure we
build with bricks here You are
supposed to know the temper of

these times -- in particularthe
one SPIRIT DRAINING FACT of our
lives

(resuming)
WHITE DRAFT 52909 21

CHARLES (contd)

We are potential raw material for
the blame industryall it takes is
for one of us to stumble on any of
the trip wires our government has
planted and the booby trap is
sprung How many former major men
must shuffle past you into ruin
before you realize our lives depend
on never forgetting that any
executive stupid enough

(having committed to anger

he taps into a well of

genuine rage)
to sell his product with too
much enthusiasm or optimism

(parenthetical thought)
and God forbid cause anyone to
expect that his firm may make an
extra penny or two in whatever
quarter is about to sucker punch us
with more competition from an
UNREGULATED foreign country

Charles stumbles with near miraculous smoothness to his
original thought

CHARLES
(continued)
Will be buried alive

CAMERA MOVES to feature Annie who is having an out-of-body
experience hearing the favorite boss of her life so raked
over the coals

CHARLES

(continued)
Ive overlooked every limitation I
know you to have because you are my
son And youre a good guy as
every prick with half a brain who
ever took advantage of you knows
absolutely But there is a bottom
line which because of your notions
of trust and

(none have said the next

word with such sarcasm)
“creativity” we may inevitably be
forced to crawl on by some
assistant US

CHARLES (cont d)
Attorney who at this moment is
answering a roommate wanted ad in
Brighton and as his first
professional act will slay us for
his 80 thousand a year as he
migrates to a future of defending
us for millions a yearand if this
almost -made-the-law review creature
pins me between a choice of saving
you or the company I founded and
you preside over I think you should
know that I will choose the company
even though doing so may break my
life foreverwhich is finally my
fault for handing you a job where
your assumptions or notions of
trust can cause such calamity

Suddenly in a visceral reflex Annie takes a swing at
Charles George grabs her hand stopping her just in time
She is shocked by her own action

ANNIE
(sotto to George)
My god sorry

Charles hasn’t noticed Ron who witnessed the episode is
about to confront Annie but George moves quickly addressing
his father and thereby forces a change of focus

GEORGE

That might have been better in
private To my knowledge I did
nothing wrong but even if I did I
dont want anyone saving me Ron
why don’t you have Annie take down
what you need

(pointedly)
Okay

He is clearly asking Ron to overlook Annies swing

RON
(a beat then)
AlrightYou should go home now and
think about interviewing attorneys
I don’t know whether circumstances
will allow the company to pay-

CHARLES
The company will pay

whose fingers fly across the

tries another speed dial

GEORGE
Hi is Bryant there yet This is
George I need to speak with

(then to Terry)
Well tell me You must have some
reaction

TERRY

I have one Im just not proud of
it It’s just me being analytical

(realizing she must offer

more)
I was thinking of my work and how
weak gravity is

(on his confused reaction)
Let me explain the thought We
build these elaborate machines-
these giant colliders to amplify
gravity just to get something
measurable

GEORGE

IsitmeorisitherIbetitsme
WHITE DRAFT 52909 29

TERRY
(making her point)

While you were talking I related
the weakness of gravity to your
capacity for feeling good right now
and how I would fail if I tried to
be one of those machines for you
Using all my energy to produce a
drop of well being in you Thats
what I thought

George doesn’t follow at all

GEORGE
Since Id really like to understand
what you just said could you do me
a favor and talk down to me

She smiles truly enjoying his remark takes a breath
(something like an athlete getting ready for exertion) and
then whispers a final intimacy to him before concluding

TERRY
This is for us I swear it

She kneels before his chair looking up at him Okay maybe
that’s not love light in her eyes but it sure contains some
kindness and affection as it get to the core truth

TERRY
We are not well matched for this
interval in your life Not with me
against this deadline And you --
being investigated We would not
survive I don’t want our
relationship to become cannon
fodder for this apparition in your
working life I11 be there for you
at the end You can count on that

George has to maneuver past some disbelief before he gets it
GEORGE
You want to split up until I’m

problem free

No

INT LISAS APT - MORNING 36

She is fast asleep on her pull-out sofa as she is awakened by
a phone ringing in the bgShe has slept so fitfully that
it takes her a bit of time to free herself from the sheets
and blankets which she does with great energy by the time
she gets to her cell phone which is attached to its charger
it has stoppedShe looks at the name of the person who has
called “Sally” She clenchesShe goes to her computer and
gtarts itunder her e-mail is an unopened correspondence
from “The United States Softball FederationSubject USA

open almost as a weight lifter summoning all strength for
the liftbut at the last minute foreboding stops her cold
and she doesn’t hit the key The phone rings againin
retreat from the decisive event of her life she exits to

She takes a toothbrush and starts to cry so suddenly that it
comes as a shock to hershe begins to vigorously brush her
teeth all the while the phone ringing in the bg stopping
and ringing againa great many people are calling her She
looks in the mirror giving herself a ferocious get a grip
look She exhales with power and reenters the living room

INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING 38

She sits down and writes a note to herself It steadies her

and with enormous suddenness hits the computer key and
engages the document and whatever it states

It takes considerably longer to catch on when your name isn’t
there than when it isAnd her’s is nowhere to be found Her
gaze pauses over the name Cam Austin 2nd base There is no
way to exaggerate the scale and heft of this trauma Even the
word “rape” is no exaggeration - a sudden and perverted
intimacy with the core of your identity So the moment is
odd out of bodyShe goes to the phonehits a speed dial

tell you this They took Cam over
me NoI‘m sure They did I have
really double checked trust me

respond to his urging

despite her own feelings)

Okay Once (peas)

And so she looks at the list again She is starting to feel
the upset of it all --

LISA

Well it still isn’t therewell I
don’t think it makes sense either
put they made their choice No I
dont want to get mad Thats not
going to help Daddy I called
because you had to hear it from me
and to ask that you do me a favor
and not get too --

(tries to find the word

and when she does it’s a

tough one)
“Sad” over thissure Okay maybe
Im a little angry- «maybe

(a dutiful daughter she is

beginning to feel rage)
Because I want to take this in
without being a jerk about it Can
we please drop it PLEASE I don’t
want to be angry right now

She throws the phone suddenly and violently across the room
where it shatters something A beatshe walks over and
picks up the phone

everyone knows it He just wanted
Cam because she plays for his
schoolwe should protest and I
don’t care that it wouldn’t do any
gooda futile act which may do
nothing but destroy all our careers

extremely intense empathy

respect for her teammates she stops working so hard at false
energy and faces them for an open moment

Thanks cor ORE everyone

But the need to go out like a champion is complexso she
says some words (albeit broadly) joking the heaviness of the
absolute key fact

And then because she is a champion she gets real and says
it simple and true

drink to feel EVEN better

But you know sometimes one drink
can give you a better perspective

Well I dont think so but maybe it
depends on the person Look have a

I want to drink I know I can
just

sorry If you want I can explain
it Maybe it’s good to talk about
it I havent really done that yet

LISA

(like a shot over him)
No I don’t think that’s a good
idea Maybe what you needI know I
dois to somehow take the strain
out of this dinner When you feel
yourself trying too hard at
something that should be simple you
know youre in trouble You have to
wait till it’s natural

WHITE DRAFT 52909 48

GEORGE
Yes Yes Yes Exactly

He starts to vigorously rub his forehead

LISA
Whats wrong

GEORGE
Im just trying to figure out Is
everything you say that smart or
am I that desperate

Her pizza comes

LISA
Well I’ve had a lifetime of great
coaches

Even that small thought about her athletic life gives her a
flash of the creeps She takes a quick cleansing breath

LISA
So what I’m suggesting is that we
eat Order something yourself
which all by itselfwill make me
more comfortable and that we don’t
work at conversation We cut
ourselves a break here and give
ourselves permission to be
quietfor the whole
dinnercompletely quiet

He takes this in for a beat then

GEORGE
Can I talk to the waiter

George indicates he’s kidding she smiles back half-
heartedly

As long as you don’t tell him about
your day

He laughsFor a few seconds anyway he has enjoyed life

The two of them silently eatingevery once in a while
catching each others awareness and making a gesture to
disengage that contact with a smile or little wave But make
no mistake even though one person is eating while the other
falls in lovethere is no flirtation or charming subtext
going on There is no subtext when two people are in this
kind of trouble so Lisa’s rules suit them both for this hour
of their liveshell it may even be some solution to dating
in general where someone warms your space while you are knee
deep in your own troubled thoughts it may be some flawed kin
of early intimacy though Lisa becomes so lost in her own
thoughts that she almost forgets George is there

As Lisa decides there will be no stair hopping tonight She
moves slowly up the stairs to her apartmentthen catches
herself wearing her oppression physically and picks up the
pace a bit

INT LISAS APARTMENT - NIGHT 55

She arrives at her door and opens it Sally looks upThen
Lisa spots something which alarms all her senses

LISAS POV

On the computer table is a bouquet of flowers and 20 little
handwritten notes stuck to the side of the tablelittle
drawings on some of them some in color

SALLY
The girls needed to tell you how
they felt Something isn’t it

LISA
The last time I saw anything like
this is when a kid in another high
school died and they left this
stuff at the scene of the accident
WHITE DRAFT 52909 52

SALLY
No Don’t do the negative take
Pull out the positive

LISA
(this actually helps her)
Yeah Okay They care They respect
what I’ve done The flowers are
prettygoodthanks

SALLY
Come on - head up Do the right
body language and the spirit might
follow How about some straight
talk

LISA
Sallyright now

SALLY
Right now you have taken the blow
of your life Very few people take
a hit like this at your age where
the thing they love most that they
have given every possible moment to
from very early childhood that
contains all the identity they ever
had or needed is suddenly goneI’m
very sensitive to what youre going
through

Sallys straight talk usually balm for her fighting spirit
is experienced by Lisa as daggers to the heartshe reacts
with tight horror to hearing the truth said out loud

SALLY

(continued)
I have been through this myself and
with others So we’re going to have
a little pajama party where you get
to talk it all outthis isa
fragile time When it happened to
me I was lucky enough to have
someone with the sensitivity to
help me deal with this Do you know

There are seven or so men and women on board all evidently

CHARLES
Dont I get a little say in the
choice when I’m willing to pay
anything

This stops all the laywer’s conversation

GEORGE
You were going to “help” not
payand is it right for a lawyer
to interview a potential defendant
and allow you someone else
involved in the issues to be
present at the first interview

The other lawyers - some nod “no”some mumble “no” One older
lawyer reacts viscerally and shouts it

OLDER LAWYER

Dylan is Irish Juries and people in general love him

I recall ik Jas only one “B” and
that had to do with being drunk in
class

(George likes the answer)
I have an important question of my
own

George treats his answer to the obvious unstated question as
if it were an oath uttered to Saint Peter

GEORGE
I did nothing to exaggerate
earnings To my knowledge I did
not engage in any wrongdoings
involving payouts to falsify
incomenor anything else illegal
or even questionable

DYLAN
No not thatCan you afford me

GEORGE
The firm refuses to pay legal bills
But my father is willing to help

DYLAN
You can’t take money from your
father because of his position on
the board It would look terrible

This is a blowthough George attempts to cover it

GEORGE
OhThat makes sense But the
company has frozen my options and
the stock itself has broken down

GEORGE (cont d)

so my net worth is What would
the amount of your retainer be

DYLAN
Well young man unfortunately we
stand at the gates of hell’s toll
booth Three hundred thousand as a
retainer and another three in
escrow in the event the government
heads toward trial

GEORGE
I’m afraid I only have a bit more
than 80 thousand liquid

Everything you can

sin aloud almost unconsciously

next to him has his hand underneath his girl’s shirt and is
rubbing her breast She is turned on and rubs his crotch
some Impressively they manage to continue loading their
plates

she turns his way and forces the player to stop grop

Honestly Because my first
impression wasn’t great Id rather
be more myself when I see her

What if someone beats you to her

He’s stunned The thought had never occurred to himbut he
has something of a strategy and he’s sticking to it

storm and I’m on this very little
boat

Ohhhh

And miraculously this little boat
is still afloat and that hoat is
that I haven’t done anything wrong
Like allowing you to tell me

constrained from revealing Not
doing anything wrong is keeping me
afloatIf I lose thatI‘m gone

accomplished something when I keep

of hold herself and take stock She is stunned by her own
sense of internal devastation

LISA
Um Whewdoes this feel like shit
Boy So this is what everybody is
always talking about

She takes a breathher freshly oxygenated brain kicks in

LISA
You have to get the team bus You
dont miss the team bus no matter
what Well talk I’m moving out
But we’ll talk
WHITE DRAFT 52909 102

MATTY
Don’t break up with me

LISA
Well that’s the thing I don’t
know if what we have is even
anything breakable

MATTY
Where you gonna go

LISA
Well I’m in luck because my
tenants hate my place - they’ve
been trying to get out of the deal
(emphatically)

Dont miss your team bus We’11
talk this out when you get back
You can’t miss a team bus

MATTY
Okay I decided I’m going to be
monogamous while I’m away You too
She nods -- it is the furthest thing from her mind
MATTY
(continued)
This will be okay

LISA
Go

He cups her faceher eyes glistenHe means what he says
next but still he is also consciously playing his “A” game

MATTY
Why do women always look best just
as they are shifting away from you

He gives her a light kiss

LISA
Oh stop it Jesus

She shoves him toward the door

George is slumped in a cushy chair virtually
asleepCharles is on the phone in the next room

CHARLES
(into phone)
Well Im going to possibly go into
all the ramifications with my son
Then I can meet with you and the
other lawyersOkay then

He hangs up and enters He nudges George

GEORGE
Weird Never felt this tired

CHARLES
Take my advice I think you should
get away from me Cut me off I’ve
just been trying to avoid an
inevitable here Have to give up on
that I tried to steer you to the
right lawyer Your guy was wrong I
could have paid your bills - used
money to make the government lose
heart in a minor matter But no
you picked a shmoe

GEORGE
I just work better with facts Just
tell me

CHARLES

George I worked for a boiler stock
operation when I was 19 There was
a violation and I got one year
probation

GEORGE
Why are you bringing that up now

Charles is reluctant to continue

GEORGE
Go

CHARLES
Because of that if they find me at
all responsible for the current
problems I would be a repeat
offender and could get 25 years in
jailthat’s why I didn’t come
forward

They look at each otherthat fact produces a genuine
though brief transcendent moment In a fleeting gesture
George touches his father’s arm in sympathy

WHITE DRAFT 52909 104

GEORGE
Wow Dad what are we going to do
here

CHARLES

Finally and at last not your
problem I need you to go because I
am in some wrestling match with
myself here I can’t trust myself
not to manipulate you - I don’t
know if I’m doing it now

(gives it some thought)
I think I am

GEORGE
Has it occurred to you as a
possibility that you can just say
what happenedwithout trying to
control the outcome

CHARLES
Honestly no

George gestures that it is worth a shot
CHARLES
If you pled out the sentence would
be three years with a chance of
getting it down to less than two

GEORGE
And you’d

CHARLES
Get off Maybe Probably

George feels a sudden thrust of energy

GEORGE
Thats everything

Charles nods
GEORGE

Okay I think this was a good
visit

EXT TRAINING FACILITY - DAY 113

A practice game has just finishedthe USA beating a solid
college teamone of the USAs beefier players (who we
know as PARTICULARLY EMOTIONAL GIRL) hits a home run and wins
the game some photographers shoves the home run hitter out
of the way to take pictures of Cam who was on base at the
time

LONG SHOT
A figure on a hill taking in the action
CLOSE ON LISA

Gnawing on her lip in anxiety She is actually considering
leaving before anyone sees her

BACK TO THE ACTION

As the teams lines up to shake handsRiva hurries through
the line spots Lisa and dashes up the hillat least half
her teammates join herincluding the home run hitter

ON LISA
Even as she shouts an admonishment

LISA
Did you even finish shaking hands
with the other team Coach’1ll blame
me

But here come the hugs and oh God she loves them -- Even as
she experiences the rush of being with them she is working
her ass off to appear light-hearted She puts her face close
to the beefy girl

LISA
Look at youLittle Miss Home Run
to the Opposite Field

PARTICULARLY EMOTIONAL GIRL
Insane that you were here for it
(to other teammate)
She worked on opposite field power
with me

EXT FIELD AREA - DUSK 114

As Riva and Lisa sit on the grass together having a beer
The vibe is clearly intimate They look down on the well-lit
playing field

RIVA
Youre doing okay Your making the
adjustment Give it time Maybe
grad school and odd jobs arent the
right thing Anybody would want you
as an assistant coach

LISA
I have to wabpmn that one

RIVA
Till what

LISA
Till I wont envy my players

RIVA
Holy shit Lise This isn’t you

LISA

I hope not Don’t tell anyone I’m
this bad or did I show it

(genuinely alarmed)
Does everybody see it Is it
leaking out of me And all of this
whining I do serves nothing Llike
my mother said to me when she was
sick “you can’t cry and fix
something at the same time”

(dabs at her eyes)
Now I’m going to feel sorry for
myself for losing my mother Just
wallow wallow wallow

Riva moves closer to put her arm around Lisa who immediately
shifts away waving it off not feeling deserving of
comforting And then instead grabs her friends two hands in
an attempt to give instead of take

LISA
(continued)
Listen to me Riva ‘cause this is
my gift to you for putting up with
me tonight Stay ‘till they tear
you away honey

hang onbecause after what we
hadyou have real life is a
killer

EXT RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT 115

To see Lisa in a very underpopulated commuter train car She
simply must find surcease

INT GEORGES APT - NIGHT 116

As he sits at his computer trying to write a letter It isa
warm night and his large window is open at his elbow We move
in on his computerbut just as we begin to read he hits the
delete key sweeping away two paragraphs and leaving just
“Dear Dad” His phone rings He mishits the phone as he
answers

GEORGE
Hello

Even though he has yet to engage the phone he vaguely hears
Lisa

LISAS VOICE
Hello

He hits the right phone key
LISA
Hi

Puzzled now by having seemingly heard Lisas distant voice
without benefit of a phone connection He leans out his
window

HIS POV

Lisa standing beneath his windowphone in hand She is
working real hard at being the casual immediate
uncomplicated girl she was so recently But in this time of
distress it is just faux real folk

LISA
How you doing

GEORGE
Good You okay

WHITE DRAFT 52909 108

LISA
Uh-huh Sure am Hope it’s not too
late to call

She turns around and looks up at the windowhe leans away
from the window

GEORGE
No What’s going on

LISA
Nothing Just that we made
indefinite plans to hang out and I
was trying to nail them
downschedule my week

GEORGE
Well anytime though soon would be
advisable
LISA

(snorting at the
preposterous thought)
I guess it’s too late for tonight

GEORGE
No Not at all I am waiting for a
call from my friend if she has her
baby tonightbut we can deal with
that if it happens

LISA
Okay Well what the heck Let’s
take a shot I can be there
inless than a half hour

GEORGE
Good

LISA
This time of night it could be
faster

GEORGE

Good I hope so

LISA

like hanging out

INT GEORGE’S APT - NIGHT 118
There is a knock on the doorhe opens it and Lisa enters

LISA
I think I should go

GEORGE
Huh

LISA

person on every nice person I know
tT was downstairs when I called you

GEORGE

Embarrass me

everyone looks rested to me

He stands poised to do anything

I can’t stop griping Youre the
one who said it “Did you ever want
to delete everything you said just
as you finished saying it” And I
thought that was the strangest
thing and lately I hear myself
being so weak and whiny and needy
that I wish I could dele

George quite suddenly clamps a hand over her mouthShe is
surprisedfeels a little violated in factthe observant
will note that she actually has made a fist

CLOSE ON LISAS EYES

As they appear over Georges hand and she tries to make sense
of the situation

GEORGE
I think the answer to what you’re
talking about is to stop talking
Just deny a voice to the thing that
is falling apart No lip service
That’s my advice Which I think I
got from you Sorry to handle you
and the situation like this but it
was an impulse I’m letting go now
(noticing the fist)
Dont hit me

ON LISAS EYES

As they reflect understanding and gratitude just before he
releases herShe takes a breathtouches him lightly in
gratitude and moves away to sit down The phone rings

GEORGE

Hey Reallyhow much How do you
feelYeah surenowcan I bring
a friend See you soon

He hangs up

stronger)

Oh well then just ask for Double
Didgets room That’s what were
all calling him for now

(sheepishly to her baby)
Your dad is here

George and Lisa smile and start to go Lisa lingers for a
second to peek at the babythey turn and George turns to see
his father enter the room This Chinatown moment is immediate
and visceral --- George speaks in the hushed tone of the
broken

GEORGE
NoNO

Lisa glances up George is on the verge of a seizure as
Charles is nudged out the room’s doorway by a heavyset man
carrying flowers and an old model video cameraHis name is
AL

GEORGE
(quickly transitioning to
Al)
Hi Congratulations on the birth of
your baby

Al leans forward and hugs Annie kisses the baby on the head

ANNIE
(to Charles)

It was very nice for you to come
by Mr Madison

CHARLES
Just wanted to drop this offTell
you not to worry about your job in

any way

ANNIE
Well that’s oh-my-God great to
hear

Charles having scored his point looks around

CHARLES
(to George)
You okay
GEORGE

Thought you might be here Would
you like to talk - go over
anythingAny new thoughts

GEORGE
No Not yet

CHARLES
Youre thinking things out

Not at this precise moment I’m on
a break

WHITE DRAFT 52909

There’s a time factor that I can no
longer shield you from
(noticing Lisa)
You a relative of Annie’s

LISA
Im a friend of George Lisa

Charles eyes her more closely and extends his hand

CHARLES

Good to meet you Call me Charles
LISA

Okay
CHARLES

I spoke to George minutes after he
met you for the first time

Lisa is mystified

LISA
No kidding

CHARLES
YesSo I was the first to know

Lisa is mystified

LISA
Outstanding

CHARLES
I‘m his father

LISA
Oh Good to see you

CHARLES
That’s nice of you to say Okay
allI Love you son Goodnight
everyone

Charles exits George is still coming down from what he

briefly thought

ANNIE
(to George)
Boss when he walked inYou didn’t
think

WHITE DRAFT 52909 115

George concedes that he did with a look

ANNIE
You poor guy

Al and Lisa exchange greetings Al is flushed with visceral
pleasure Annie looks over at himeye contact that contains
the dna of all that is good and produces huge grins

ON AL

The moment of his life is upon him He walks over to George
and whispers as he hands him his video camera

Hey Im MORE) do something
record itRed button

(he sits on the bed facing

the mother of his child)
I got to say somethingto you For
christ’s sake to the two of you I
don’t want you to think the reason
we aren’t married is because I
think anyone else is anything It’s
because I am 47 and a failure

ANNIE
Ill kill you - you talk like that

During this exchange Lisa feels she is somehow violating
their privacy and is trying to make her getaway but she can’t
get George’s attention Nonetheless she decides to exit and
waiks to the door

AL
Ill get work I guessbut no
seniority anymore orbut don’t
get me sidetracked The reason I
didn’t talk marriage is I couldn’t
stand to see you -- the princess of
worry -- weighted down by me and my
limited prospects

And now he has Lisa’s attention She pauses at the door

AL
Because I get your worry And
people could think that’s the bad
thing about you but I get that it’s
because of your great heartand I
love you for it
WHITE DRAFT 52909 116

AL (contd)
And then I worried about what would
happen to you - and now the little

hulk - if you ended up with someone
who thought your worry was --

ANNIE
Neurotic

AL
Yes Someone who didn’t get
youwho made you feel bad about
yourselfwho wanted you to be more
normalwho wanted you to like
yourself more Who wanted you to
change Who didn’t love all of it
Who wouldn’t leave great enough
alone And -- I didnt sleep
manI thought I can do that for
youand that was a legitimate
function for me in your life

Annie cheers as if at a ballgame

AL
And that allows me to propose to
you that we get married

Annie blubbers Al is emotional Lisa is rapt Al hugs
Annie Lisa and George applaud as Annie and Al have a brief
and intimate exchange

ANNIE
Youre not scared anymore

AL
I am But scared is a step up from
terror and terror is what I feel
about losing you

Annie gasps Al holds her in this their quintessential
moment Al looks at George and says through tear glazed eyes

AL
Did you get it

GEORGE
(stricken)
Oh my GodI just got caught up
with what you were saying

AL
(this can’t have happened)
You didn’t get it
WHITE DRAFT 52909 117

GEORGE
No

annie has missed this exchange due to being blissed out

AL
He didn’t get it

ANNIE
(stricken)
He didn’t get it

GEORGE
I can’t tell you how

LISA
(driving force)
Come onright away - lets do it
again Just do it nowgo ahead
Al Well record it

Al is willing but there is a problem

AL
Who knows what I said

GEORGE
I sure do

LISA
Lets just think and piece this
together right away

Everyone is wiping tears away as they agree to try Al gets
to his initial position when he said his piece George as
deliberately as possible pushes the record switch What
follows is very informalsome improvs called for people
talking on top of one anotherthis group exercise is marked
by great spirit and enormous light heartedness but still
real dedication to the task at handrecreating the proposal

ON AL
As he takes his highly self-conscious shot

AL
I didnt want you to think that the
reason I didn’t ask to get married
was because I ever had a thought of
anyone else

He’s stuck
WHITE DRAFT 52909 118

GEORGE
(to Al)
You said it was because you had no
prospects You used the word
“failure”

AL
(to Annie)
Its because I don’t want to saddle
you with a 47 year old failure

Lisa comes in quickly

LISA
Annie”I‘1l kill you if”
ANNIE
(laughing)
Thanks “I’1l kill you if you talk
like that”
GEORGE

Then you said that you didn’t want
her to end up with

ANNIE
Someone who wanted her to change
what she couldn’t change

Annie’s line grounds things The laughter stops---the import
and dignity return -

ANNIE

Someone who didn’t get me

GEORGE
There was that whole list

LISA
(primarily to Annie)

He was worried that youd be with
gomeone who made you feel bad about
yourselfwho wanted you to like
yourself in a different way Who
wanted you to change Who didn’t
love all of you
WHITE DRAFT 52909 119

GEORGE
(primarily to Al)
You said that protecting her from
that - appreciating her the way you
dowas a legitimate function for
you in her life

AL
Wow I said that

ANNIE
I feel like youre all proposing to
me

AL

And then I asked you to marry me

LISA
No no no What you said was
(enunciating very
carefully)
“I propose to you that we get
married”

ANNIE
And you called him “little hulk”
which I don’t know why is my
favorite thing I love you so much
Al Thanks everybody
(to George)
I think we have it

He stops recording She holds her arms out and gives him a
hug

ANNIE
Im so worried about you

GEORGE
Please don’t

AL
Let her be

George nodsclaps Al on the back Lisa approaches Annie and
has to laugh even as she says the nuclear understatement

LISA
Well it was nice meeting you

They hug Annie laughs as well

WHITE DRAFT 52909 120

ANNIE
Nice meeting you too I love you

And that cracks them up because like they say “its funny
because it’s true”

LISA
(helplessly)
Me too

George is truly digging Lisa And now the awkwardness as they
nod and exit

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 120

The awful thing is the sharp change in their ethos A second
ago they seemed a coupleand now that quickly much like
Double Digit so recently experienced they are thrust from
that warm safe womb like space into the awkward starkness
of the real world There is considerable culture shock as
they walk toward the exit of the hospital self-consciously
the space between them as they walk widening in small
increments

EXT HOSPITAL - BUS STOP - NIGHT 121

As they exit - (some horrible but legit sign about health
insurance regulations in the background) It’s a warm night
light breeze blowing streetlights providing just the right
light and each of them still looking for a proper punctuation
to the recent experience A small but persistent shyness has
come into their atmosphere

LISA
Thanks

She is surprised that the word comes out with difficulty
She is still a bit choked up She laughs slightly and gives
it another go There is an unmistakable shyness

LISA
Thanks for the soul food I11 just
catch my bus over there

GEORGE
I’11 wait with you

LISA
(softly)
Okay good Thanks
WHITE DRAFT 52909 121

And then with such ill timing that they each take it in with
a bit of horror the bus turns the corner Lisa shrugs And
then as she boards the bus notes that George already has
his back to her and is walking away As the bus starts up

ON GEORGE

So sullen at being cheated out of his moment with Lisa that
an outburst escapes him just as Lisa aboard the bus passes
unnoticed in the background

GEORGE
(to the heavens)
I can’t catch a break

FULL SHOT - THE STREET

As George continues to walk and sees that Lisa has gotten off
the bus at the next street She jogs his way

GEORGE
What

LISA
What I saw youshouting and all
crazy

GEORGE
No Just weird that you were off
that fast

LISA

Well I can wait for the next bus
You just charged away

GEORGE
Yeah Okay

Looking up the deserted street
GEORGE
Well I think we’1l have some time
now Won’t-

Another bus appears

LISA
What is this

GEORGE
I think it’s the opposite of a bus
strike
WHITE DRAFT 52909 122

She nods with a half smile -- it was sort of clever As they
let it pass
GEORGE
(continued)

Wont Matty be worried

LISA
Ummm I didn’t tell you we’re not
living together right now I
thought I did

GEORGE
No I would have remembered

The bus stops near them The driver steps out and lights a
cigarette The bus’ sign shows a change of route

DRIVER
Youve got till I finish this

GEORGE
Okay Thanks

GEORGE
(to Lisa)
Go ahead Matty

LISA

Were still working on it froma
different slanthe gets back
tomorrow Hes throwing me a
belated birthday party tomorrow
night Going all out Not my choice
but when youre in something you’ve
got to give it everything you have

GEORGE
Makes sense Am I invited

LISA
(totally thrown)
Surebut it’s a very testosterony
group

GEORGE
So I am invited

LISA
Sure What are you talking about
Of course

WHITE DRAFT 52909 123

The driver tosses his cigarette and reboards the bus as Lisa
starts to follow him

GEORGE
When is your birthday

LISA
Tonight

She leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek

INT GEORGES APT - NIGHT 122

As he enters propelled by the confusion flying away from his
mind and spirit One shouted word

GEORGE
Clarity

He goes to the table near the ever open window where we
briefly see and read bits of the worksheets (reading REASONS
FOR AND REASONS AGAINSTThe top line on one “I don’t want
to go to jail” On the other “I don’t want my father to
spend the rest of his life in jail”) He crumples the sheets
tosses them and speed dials his father who answers before one
ring is finished

126 INT MATTYS WALK IN CLOSET - NIGHT 126

We hear him telling Lisa off-camera how great it is to see
her as he leads her toward us He is carrying a garbage bag --
some of the following speech is off-camera

MATTY
I haven’t gone without a woman s0
long since I had mono in high
school but it felt -- well you saw
the box scores three one inning
stints three up three down top
five player of the month talk

He goes to the tooth brush drawer and dumps them in the bag
he goes to the sweat outfit drawer and begins dumping them

LISA
Youre not going to throw them
away
MATTY
Yeah It’s a statement
LISA
Give them to a hospital or
something
MANNA

Great idea The clubhouse guy will
take care of it And no unattached
women allowed tonightOne guy is
bringing his sister Now

He sits her down in his “valet chair The kind with a
mahogany wooden hanger little wooden dish for cuff links
and little cane seat

MATTY
I get to give you a gift

She eyes him -- churning There is a paper Tiffany bag
suddenly in evidence This is clearly an important moment
coming upsome flower strewn crossroadsshe is gripped by a
tightness which she hopes is excitement but might be terror
There seems to be only ome course open to her and she takes
it

I have to pee

127 INT CHARLES APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Charles sits and indicates the chair for George

GEORGE
No thanks I have to get
someplace

CHARLES
You look

GEORGE
Great I’m shooting for great
tonight OkayI know you want the
bottom line but do you care about
my reasoning

CHARLES
(wisely lying)
Yes of course

GEORGE
First thingand it was an all
nighter to get thereyou know
same as in anything the answer
starts with asking the right
questionAnd the question here
wasn’t whether I go to jail or you
do

CHARLES
It wasn’t

GEORGE
No The question was will I go to
jail for three years or live for
25 years feeling awful because of
your being in jail

CHARLES
(sincerely)
Very good

GEORGE
I went over different scenarios to
get varying perspectives If I had
children I wouldnt consider going
to jail

WHITE DRAFT 52909 127

CHARLES
But you don’t

GEORGE
Right Or if I had someone crucial
to the life I want for myself it
would be perverse - some
denunciation of the experience of
life itself if I gave that up

Charles prepares to take some very rough medicine

CHARLES
Well that’s an extreme point of
viewDo you have such a person

GEORGE
Tee dont know
I am going downstairs and somehow
find out There’s a party She’s
there There’s another guy

CHARLES
You mean she may be unavailable

Just the words kills him Robs him briefly of his exuberance

GEORGE
(mumbling)
Ican thinkthatwayrightnowthendon’t

CHARLES
What

George tries to think of his thoughtand does

GEORGE
I can’t think that way right now
‘Cause I’m going down there and
take my shotIf I don’t have a
chance with her I‘1l go to jail for
you DadBut if I have any chance
at all I can’t

Wish me luck

INT MATTY’S APT - WALK IN CLOSET - NIGHT 128

As Matty arranges a small Tiffany’s paper bag on the floor
near the valet chair Lisa enters from the toilet Matty
indicates she should sit in the chair again He picks up the
small bag and waves itthen suddenly realizes the
impression he is giving which might have screwed up
everything which would make him a moron He quickly blurts
out a key fact to avoid crushing Lisa with disappointment

MATTY
It’s not a ring
(on her reaction)
Well you don’t have to look so
relieved

She smooches him on the head patching his ego leak Now she
sits

MATTY
Okay Maybe I don’t get ona knee
for this but

He bows more like a curtsey It is sweet She is touched
Matty takes a breath scaling a great mountain with great
uncertainty as to the purpose He takes out a box and hands
it to herShe starts to unwrap it carefully

MATTY
Come on not so slow

He actually starts to rip at itShe joins him in a shared
light moment and looks inside

LISA
Whoa whoa whoaIt‘s gorgeous
Butit’s gorgeous

MATTY
But what

LISA
Just thinking about when I would
wear it

MATTY
I’1ll take you places

She now removes an eleven thousand dollar watch circled in
diamonds

WHITE DRAFT 52909 129

MATTY
Do you not get the meaning

LISA
(no idea whatsoever)
Um that time iswhat That it’s
our time to have a new kind of time
that

MATTY
(gravely)
It means that we’re engaged to be
engaged

Lisa looks on the back of the watch

MATTY
It doesn’t say it You just know
itmy father gave my mother a
watch and four years later they
were engaged

LISA
Okay

MATTY
Dont say”okay” Ask anyone

LISA

Matty looks disappointed

LISA
Well I don’t know what to say

MATTY

Matty grinssuddenly George sticks his head in the door He
sees them

GEORGE
Oh sorry

LISA

WHITE DRAFT 52909 130

GEORGE
Yes Ill be right out here

MATTY
Good to see you

GEORGE
Thanks

He ducks out

MATTY
We better get going Our first
party as a couple

LISA
What were we those other times

He hugs her

INT MATTYS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 129

All the ball players crowded in as a man with a jump suit and
a JET HELICOPTER LOGO on his back carries in two large crates
of live lobster to the kitchen He is moving with
considerable speedsome of the ballplayers applaud

ON GEORGE

As he pauses on the outskirts of the gathering from his
pocket he takes a small jar shaped gift wrapped box

GEORGES POV

As Liga enters the room and starts to head over then shrugs
helplessly as Matty intercepts her to show off her new
watch There are SEVERAL REACTION SHOTS from the players and
their women to the watch George moves to the terrace where a
buffet line has already formed for the LOBSTER

ON LISA

Her arm extended showing her watch while her head cranes
looking for George

LISA
Let me go find George he doesn’t
know anybody

MATTY
(uncomfortable then)
Ill come with you

WHITE DRAFT 52909 131

as they start for the terrace Matty is waylaid by Tori (the
Japanese pitcher) He is with the girl whose podice caught
his note She clearly loves the guy-

ON LISA

As George comes up behind her and forcefully moves her out to
the terrace--

EXT MATTYS APT - TERRACE - NIGHT 130

GEORGE
I have to talk with you

LISA
Sure How you doing

GEORGE
Pretty good heightened awareness
anxious excited I got you a
gift

He hands her the package She sits at a small metal outdoor
table She opens it elaborately and slowly He waits
patiently Somehow she becomes aware of a strange rush of
appreciation for this small fact - that priefly though
enormously touches her She stops unwrapping to look at him
and unconsciously say 4 mouthful

LISA
Thanks for not rushing me

George reacts to the screaming subtext as finally she sees
the gift And whatever petals of hers were just opening slam
shut She is puzzled His stock has clearly fallen

LISA
Man you are odd

We now see the gift It ig the can of Play-Doh George took
from his office We will also have seen it in the background
of a few shots in his apartment

GEORGE
Odd good or odd bad

LISA
Well Ima fan of regular
WHITE DRAFT 52909 132

GEORGE
Thats only half the gift Its
nothing without the story The
story makes it regular

She is skeptical - he starts selling hard

GEORGE

(continued)
This stuff was invented by a man in
central Ohio as a white goo used to
remove soot from wallpaper which
got really filthy from old
fashioned heating

SHOT

Perhaps the world’s first look of a womans wrist circled by
a diamond watch while her hand holds a can of Play-Doh

GEORGE
(continued)

So as gas and electric heating came
in there was no more need for this
cleaning goo The guy was going
under everything he based his life
on was coming to an end Then his
sister-in-law who was a nursery
school teacher

LISA
(interrupting)
This is a true story

GEORGE
(triumphantly)
The man’s name was Joe McVicker
his sister-in-law was Kay Zoofall

LISA
Okay I believe you

GEORGE
Kay Zoofall discovered that her
little kids liked squeezing the goo
a lot more than hard modeling clay
She suggested to her brother-in-law
Joe that they color the stuff and
call it Play-Doh

Lisa (her life spent on a foundation of motivational
thoughts sentences and stories) is jazzed by the tale

WHITE DRAFT 52909 133

LISA
Hey nice

GEORGE
So I just kept this around for
proof that were just one small
adjustment away from making our
lives work You can see why I
thought of this for you

LISA
Yes

GEORGE
Take back what you said about me
being odd

LISA

Fair enough

(she brandishes the gift)
Thanks I’m going to put it away
before anyone asks me what I’m
doing with it I could never tell
that story as well as you do

She exits George watches her go So does Matty who now
approaches George

MATTY
Hey you try the lobster
GEORGE
Not yet
MATTY

You should

(looking at his watch)
One hour and fifty-one minutes ago
it was swimming in the ocean

GEORGE

but yeah Sorry

Matty a little pugnaciously seeks to put

George on the spot

MATTY

GEORGE

He concentrates

It is a weirdly long beat

RYAN

The players laugh But George has a bead on the answer

GEORGE

GEORGE (cont d)
(he sees Lisa)
As “oda” as that is the only other
thing you are just as sure of is
that she’s in there with you

MATTY
Yeah thats close to our thing

Doug notes Lisa’s reaction to George

DOUG
(to Matty)
Curtains

He walks to Lisa She is staggered but hanging onto
propriety She tries to treat it lightly

LISA
Whats with you tonight

GEORGE
1 need to talk to you Really And
that means I have to get you out of
this party And if that feels out
of the question to you there‘s
probably nothing to talk about

MATTY
Show him the watch
GEORGE
Im going to wait at the bus stop
for the next ---SEVEN DAYS No

T’1ll hang out there a while
He leaves

ON LISA

She goes through the five stages of compliance what are they
again Amusement confusion awkwardness resistance
decision With decision she tugs at Matty’s sleeve to
indicate she needs a moment of privacy with him They walk to
another area Matty with the airs of confidenceonce they
find their spot Before she can speak

MATTY
Don’t dump me

LISA
Matty I think youre moving a
little too quickly
i)

WHITE DRAFT 52909 136

MATTY
First time I’ve been accused of
that

LISA

You can’t make important decisions
when your head is mush And tonight
is extremely confusing to me
George neverMaybe I’11 just go
hang out with him I don’t know
what to do at these parties
anywayAnd this isn’t really for
my birthdaynone of my friends

MATTY
That was my mistakeshould have
thought of that Too little too
late and stupid I can learn from

this

LISA
Youre fine you’re sweet youre
fun

MATTY

All the hot words

LISA
This is positive Were not ducking
anything Everything’s out in the
open

MATTY
You know what Go ahead Hang out
But I want you to take in that Im
the kind of guy who has the
confidence to say that That’s key
to any decision you make

LISA
Got it

She puts the diamond watch on the valet chair trayShe looks
at himthis parting not easy for either oneMatty is
trying to duck the unique pang which is enveloping him With
utter lack of conviction

MATTY
Im confident

She is touched She hugs him and exits
