DATSRICH DAM LocaATION SUrDR IGE

LONG CHUT It is deep nignt anc we cannot see
whet we are looking at It is in fact 2 dam
project msering its completion A Red Star and
Russian lettering in néon hover in the sky
(fhece are in fact on scaffolding percned on
tne ton of the aan as we shell see when day-
light comes at the end of the film) For the
moment the nuge bulx of the dam itself could be

one with the mountain walls which heave up from
the floor of the narrow valley At the foot of
one of these almost perpendicular walls we can

see the black mouth of a tunnel From the tunnel
a line of pecple emerze antlike Another line

of people enter so that the two movements are
contrepuntal This is all-we can see during
CREDIT TITLES After the FINAL TITIES

We move in seeing that these are manuel workers
one shift coming from work the otner going to it
There is no suggestion of slave-labour they walk
haphezere in ones and twos and bunches as workers

everywhere They exchange odd greetings as they
pass What is unfemiliar to us is the high pre--

ponderance of women among these heavy leoourers

(as from their garb and gait they evidently are)
and among these the preponderance of young ones

CUT
EXTERIOR GRAVEYARD LOCATION DAY EARLY WINTER

HIGH-ANGLE LONG SHOT Under a snew-heavy sky moved by a
strong wind is spread a flat landscape full and immense In the
distance something winds towards us like an eel across a vast pale
field of stubble The CAMERA ZOOMS Slowly in We begin to
recognise a procession people in blacx and hear above the wind a
requiem chant led by a choir The ZOOM continues

MEDIUM SHOT Still ZOOMING inwards we see that the procession
consists of some forty persons mostly PEASANTRY of semi-Asiatic -
type but a few MIDDLE-CLASS ladies and gentlemen They are
following a coffin carried shoulder high Immediately behind the coffin
walks 2 boy dressed in black This in CLOSE SHOT is the thin-faced
dark-eyed YURI his features a refined version of the PRASANTS

He is looking up at

CLOSE SHOT TRACKING The COFFIN It is open showing the
CORPSE OF A WOMAN surrounded by flowers The waxen face has
the’ same exotic beauty as the boys

CLOSE UP TRACKING YURI His eyes leave the coffin and look
gravely ahead

LONG SHOT Angling past the shoulder of a sinuous semi-oriental
dome we see the burial ground its headstones its high wall topped
with a running curve of ornament its old carved gates hanging open
the procession approaching

MEDIUM SHOT (On SOUND the Singing approaching) The HEAD-
STONES share the unfamiliar styling of the building Some are of
sheet iron and wag and rattle gently in the wind Most are overgrown

CLOSE SHOT A HEADSTONE of heavy wood On ita photograph of
the deceased a middle-aged man of quasi-asiatic type with long
moustaches The singing louder

CLOSE SHOT A sheet-iron headstone wags in the wind On ita
photograph of a child Past this comes the PRIEST leading the coffin-
bearers and YURI The CAMEPA follows him in CLOSE UP He

is looking about with a sort of wondering alertness at

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT THE HEADSTONES monstrous On
one the PHOTOGRAPH of a WOMAN in her bridal gown

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT YURI He looks upwards again
CLOSE TRACKING SHOT The COFFIN looming above him

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT YURI Looks downwards from the coffin
Checks suddenly The head of the procession has come to a halt
Looks upwards as

CLOSE SHOT The PRIEST towers over him stretching out a hand

CLOSE SHOT YURI is gently propelled into a new position by the
Priests hands Something above him catches his eye

CLOSE SHOT The COFFIN is being lowered from its high perch
against the sky The CAMERA follows it downwards until the DEAD
WOMANS FACE comes to rest beside an open grave —

CLOSE UP YURI We expect some reaction But instead the
Singing ceases and he looks round him with timid curiosity

HIGH-ANGLE LONG SHOT Looking down on the group around the
grave we see the MOURNERS and LOCALS shuffle round into a circle

of respectful radius isolating YURI on one side of the grave the
PRIEST on the other The MOURNERS are well dressed some dressed
elegantly and carry wreaths Behind them are the LOCALS roughly
clad curious Movement ceases except for the wind All stare a
YURI

CLOSE SHOT ANNA and ALEXANDER GROMEKO with child TONYA
between them ANNA a well-dressed middle-aged lady with a too
sensitive face ALEXANDER a dignified and gentle academic They
regard YURI with deep sympathy

MEDIUM SHOT From their POV we see YURI and the PRIEST
who now commences

PRIEST
The earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the
- arth and everything that dwells therein etc

CLOSE UP TONYA one hand in her mothers peering shyly at

‘CLOSE UP YURI He looks up with respectful curiosity

CLOSE SHOT the PRIEST From Yuri s low eye-line he looks
gigantic He is reading from a small black book with professional
solemnity His professional boredom is revealed in the way he sways
his weight from heel to toe and adjusts his vestments as the wind
pulls at them He glances down his nose at

CLOSE SHOT YURI He lowers his eyes sees something and
cocks his head slightly

CLOSE SHOT His ‘MOTHER A YELLOW LEAF has blown onto
her face

CLOSE SHOT YURI ‘He looks away at

MEDIUM SHOT A SILVER BIRCH is shedding its last yellow leaves
into the grey wind

CLOSE SHOT YURI The CAMERA TRACKS slowly towards him

MEDIUM SHOT THE TREE from YURIS POV coming gradually
closer as the CAMERA ZOOMS slowly in On SOUND the PRIESTs
official lamentation begins to dwindle overlain by a magical
Singing a dirge for the tree as it parts with its leaves

CLOSE UP YURI The CAMERA continues its track into BIG CLOSE
UP The Priests voice is by now entirely taken over by the DIRGE

For a few moments YURI is lost inthe music Then with great
suddenness a harsh grating cuts off the DIRGE and YURI looks quickly -
his first and only moment of horror - at

CLOSE SHOT The COFFIN LID is dragged into place by TWO SEXTONS
obscuring his mothers face

CLOSE UP YURI watches rivetted The SOUND of the lid slipping
into place a warning grunt followed by loud banging

CLOSE SHOT The TWO SEXTONS both hammer furiously at nails
already lined-up in prepared holes

CLOSE UP YURI On SOUND the shocking din stops as abruptly -
as it began Silence for a moment and then a rising murmur of voices
He looks round at

MEDIUM SHOT The LCCALS press forward anxious not to miss the
next moment The MOURNERS express shocked resentment but they
too are fascinated —

CLOSE SHOT YURI He looks down
CLOSE SHOT The COFFIN is disappearing into the grave

CLOSE SHOT YURI steps forward to the very edge He is frowning
with the effort to take in what is being done but it could be taken for
morbid curiosity and

CLOSE SHOT ANNA A little shocked or daunted

MEDIUM SHOT Ropes are whipped up from the grave by four hefty
PEASANTS who have accomplished the job The SEXTONS hasten
to shovel earth into it one of them gently moves YURI back witha
big hand the better to perform his work

’

CLOSE SHOT The COFFIN lying in the grave earth and pebbles
thundering and rattling on the wood -

CLOSE UP YURI On SOUND the terrible drumming continues The
CAMERA moves ints VERY BIG CLOSE UP His face is clenched
with effort intellectual effort of enquiry not emotional effort of
control He is trying to come te terms with Death

CLOSE UP In grey light faintly luminous the perfected face of
YURIS MOTHER eyes closed tranquil is turned up to the shower of
thundering earth upon the coffin lid above her as to a shower of gentle
Tain oe

CLOSE SHOT The GRAVE Through a foreground of flying spades
we see that the coffin is almost covered

BIG CLOSE UP YURI has made his terms He looks thoughtful but
not shocked awed but upright and is unaware of anything but what he
has just perceived On SOUND the earth begins to fall softly on earth
the CAMERA MOVES BACK and we hear the wailing of peasant women
YURI hears it understands it has nothing for him turns his head a
bit to see

CLOSE SHOT The BIRCH TREE swaying in the wind On SOUND

the confused noise of wailing the sobs of a lady the occasional cough
of a gentleman again succumb to the magic dirge The CAMERA
CRANES UPWARDS through the branches and flying leaves against
Processional clouds as YURI cannot possibly see them except in imagin-
ation and then SOUND modulating we follow a shower of leaves out
of the moving cage of twigs to fly in freedom for a moment in grey
space and

CLOSE UP YURI MUSIC cuts He is recalled to himself looks
round startled

MEDIUM SHOT YURI in foreground ANNA is beckoning him from
the head of the grave Evident She has said something to recall

him from what must have been a prolonged trance for only she
PRIEST ALEXANDER and TONYA are now present and they are Iook-
ing at him curiously The grave is piled with wreaths The
MOURNERS are making their way with discreet relief along the path

to the monastery which abutts onto the graveyard Lights are appearing
in the windows there

YURI understands that they are waiting for him to place his small
nosegay He walks forward to do so He stops

CLOSE SHOT His small footsteps in the earth
CLOSE UP YURI He looks up at the adults to see how bad this is

CLOSE SHOT ALEXANDER and ANNA ANNA looks upset but
ALEXANDER gives him a faint encouraging smile

CLOSE SHOT YURI places his nosegay among the wreaths ANNA
enters picture takes his hand smiling at him perhaps a little
hesitantly and leads him off into LONG SHOT where they join ALEX-
ANDER and TONYA 4 little flurry of SNOW drifts across the picture
ALEXANDER looks up at the sky They follow the PRIEST down the

CLOSE UP The PRIEST from YURIS POV his eyes shut and
Lips moving in silent prayer

MEDIUM SHOT They are ina little lamp-lit white-washed cell

The few articles of furniture are of plain white wood There is a
crucifix on the wall A small domed trunk stands on the floor beneath
the window His prayer concluded the PRIEST makes the sign of

the Cross over the child opens his eves and smiles down with
professional benevolence YURI continues to examine him The
PRIEST looks rather uncertainly atANNA who looks uncertainly back
at him The PRIEST clears his throat

PRIEST 5
You and your husband will dine with us Madame Gromeko

ANNA
Thank you Father

The PRIEST goes watched carefully by YURI The watchfulness
of his keen little face hasnt altered And ANNA is a little nervous
of him

Will you lie down then Yuri

He looks at her and obediently lies back still looking at her
Nervously tucking him in she Says

Your mummy and I were great great friends you know

This very decent lady is excusing herself for taking to herself the
mothers part but this dreadfully self-contained child continues
simply to look at her

So now we are going to look after you

YURI
Thank you

With startling suddenness the child half rises looking fiercely off
and saying very coldly

Thats Mothers

ALEXANDER stands in the doorway holding a fine balalaika He
is stopped short by the childs intensity but comes and places the
instrument on the bed (the child sitting up to receive it) saying quietly

ALEXANDER
Its yours now

122 Continued

YURI doesnt touch it but looks down at it His tone is deadpan ©

YURI

Mine

ANNA

Yes Mummy left it to you
YURI

In her will

His face is still turned down from them his tone expresses nothing
of whatever he is feeling the phrase is dbviously from some adult
conversation he has overheard he is probing for information And
évidently there is some awkwardness in this region The GROMEKOS
exchange a wary glance ALEXANDER says gently and seriously
inexpertly avuncular

ALEXANDER
Do you know what a Will is old chap

YURI
Money

He looks straight up at them as he makes this unconscious indictment
of adult values ANNA is a bit thrown

ANNA
Well no Yuri just this Your Daddy has all the money

Looking down again his face hidden he runs his fingers clumsily over
the strings Brightly

Can you play it
He shakes his head

ALEXANDER (Robust)
I thought all the people in this part of the world could play
the balalaika

YURI (Looks at him palely)
You dont live here do you

ANNA (Gently)

‘No Yuri we live in Moscow thats a long way from here
(Bright again) But youll like Moscow (To her husband)
Want ho

122 Continued

ALEXANDER (Quietly looking at the boy)
After a bit Takes time to get used to things doesnt it
old man

YURI looks at him Then down at the instrument But evidently
he has registered the gentle respect of ALEXANDERs tone for he
vouchsafes

YURI
Mother could play it

He takes his hands from it signalizing that he has finished with it
ALEXANDER takes it ANNA rises saying seriously

ANNA
Oh Well your mother was an Artist Yuri Your mother
had a Gift

We understand from her intonation that Art and Gift are taken
Seriously in the Gromeko household ALEXANDER placing the
balalaika on the table for the child to see (b4 the child looks steadily
at them not it) says cheerfully

ALEXANDER
Perhaps Yuris got a gift (To YURI) Would you like
lessons

YURI
I cant play it

The GROMEKOS looks at him from the doorway quite daunted

ANNA (Brightly)
Well Say goodnight to Yuri Tonya

TONYA goes to him

CLOSE SHOT YURI and TONYA Gravely they kiss cheeks she
with shy tenderness he with cold courtesy On SOUND ANNA

gently

(SOUND)
Hes your brother now

TONYA leaves him He settles back On SOUND

126 Continued

ANNA (SOUND rather hopelessly)
Goodnight Yuri

ALEXANDER (SOUND sympathetically robust)
Goodnight old chap an

YURI (inexpressively)
Goodnight

On SOUND the door closes YURI turns his head to look at

CLOSE SHOT The BALALAIKA a magnificent thing of polished
wood and mother of pearl On SOUND we hear it play softly

CLOSE UP YURI as before On SOUND the balalaika stronger

CLOSE UP The BALALAIKA on SOUND the music full a virtuoso
at the strings

CLOSE SHOT YURI frowns gets from bed cutting off the music
He kneels eyes firmly closed hands correctly together and

YURI

Dear God and my Holy Guardian Angel keep me in the

path of truth And please tell Mother not to worry
Please tell her that I like the Gromekos very much
Please don‘t let her worry For our Saviour’s sake Amen

He nips back into bed and burrows shivering beneath the coverings
A terrible howling and clattering wells up on SOUND as

a dreadful error There are two kinds of men and only
two That young man is one Kind He is Highminded
He is “Pure” He is the kind of man the world pretends
to look up to and in fact despises What is more he is the
kind of man who breeds unhappiness Particularly in
women Do you understand

LARA (Angry eyes flashing)
No

KOMAROVSKY
I think you do There is another kind of man Not high-

minded Not pure But alive (This flattering assess-

ment of himself is made with some passion) Now that your
tastes at this moment should incline towards the juvenile is
understandable But for you to marry that boy is pure
disaster Because - (She covers her ears he pulls her
hands away) Because there are two kinds of women
(Be lets it sink in) and you as - we - well - know are not
the first kind

attention thoroughly caught

Another silence ensues but now they look at each other

LARA
Wed have got married and had a house and children
(She says it wonderingly) If wed had children Yuri
would you have liked a boy or a girl

She is still smiling and YURI smiling with her He is inclined to join
in the elaboration of the wish dream But he receives an apprehension

of what they are at His smile goes

YURI
I think we may go mad if we think about - all that

LARA (Her smile persists)

I shall always think about it (He looks at her she looks

at the poems) Will you write today

YURI
No not to-day

ants aSleeping-car you would travel in comfort And
safety

Seeing written paper on the desk he has picked it up with insolent idle
curiosity Finding it to be a poem he tosses it back with genuine off-
hand contempt and it falls accidently to the floor LARA retrieves it
and puts it back on the desk as KOMAROVSKY sits in YURI’s chair

KOMAROVSKY
Shes Strelnikovs wife Why dyou think they havent
arrested her - thats the usual practice Why dyou think
they watched her in Yuriatin They were waiting for
Strelnikov

- YURI (Looking at him wary but beginning to breathe
hard) If they thought that Strelnikov would run to his
wife - they didnt know him

KOMAROVSKY

They knew him very well He was five miles from here
when they caught him (YURI stares appalled
KOMAROVSKY calmly presses his advantage) Ill tell
you the manner of it He was arrested on the open road
He didnt conceal who he was Indeed throughout the
interview he insisted that they call him Pavel Antipov” -
which is his right name - and refused to answer to the
name of Strelnikov On his way to execution he took a
pistol from one of the guards and blew his own brains out

YURI
Oh my God (His gaze wonders suddenly flashes in
alarm) Dont tell Lara this

KOMAROVSEY

I know Lara at least as well as youdo This neurotic
gesture at the eleventh hour is just the sort of thing that
would unbalance her But you see her position Shes
served her purpose Those men who came with me to-day
as an escort will come for her and the child to-morrow
as a firing squad

KOMAROVSKY drinks in YURIs helplessness The venemous resent-
ment of what follows is the more frightening because it must be kept lov

(Smiling) 7
Now I know exactly what you think of me And why
But if youre not coming with me shes not coming with me
So are you coming with me Do youaccept the protection
of this - ignoble Caliban - (Softly) On any terms that
Caliban cares to make (He lets this sink in) Or is your
delicacy so exhorbitant that you will sacrifice a woman
