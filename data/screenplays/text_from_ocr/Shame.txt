INT BEDROOM APARTMENT DAWN

BRANDON SULLIVAN early 30s lies staring up caught in a
disarray of sheets until-

The PEEP PEEP PEEP of an alarm clock from deep within a
distant apartment

The MUFFLED PAD of FOOTSTEPS crossing overhead-

BRANDON listens then gets up pulls blinds and heads out
towards the bathroom-

The SOUND of his feet disappearing down a distant corridor
The MURMUR of an answer phone as we hear BRANDON peeing in a
far off bathroom

2 INT PLATFORM SUBWAY DAWN
BRANDON stands looking down watching until-
A SUDDEN breeze the subway train oncoming-
BRANDON boards
The doors GLIDE SHUT-
BRANDON just visible through the window of the train walking
towards a distant seat

3 INT TRAIN SUBWAY MORNING
BRANDON sits eyes casually tracing over the faces in the
crowded train A HOMELESS MAN sits further along the car
haggard and grey and sleeping the seat empty either side

of him He looks more like a pile of clothes

BRANDON turns back The reflection of an PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL
caught in the glass opposite
INT CORRIDOR APARTMENT DAWN

BRANDON padding naked along a corridor He flicks on an
answer machine in passing-

FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE
HeyIts mePick Up Pick
Up

He enters the bathroom

INT CORRIDOR APARTMENT DAWN

We hear BRANDON peeing in the bathroom

INT CORRIDOR APARTMENT DAWN

The answer machine message drowned by the flushing of the
toilet the shutting of the door and the shower being
switched on

INT SUBWAY MORNING

A HOMELESS MAN head lolling sat alone at the end of a busy
car

BRANDON considers catching the eye of-

A PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL seated opposite the whisper of a smile
grazing her lips

BRANDONs eyes teasing over-

The fall of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRLs hair-

The dip in her collarbone-

Her nail polish with French manicure-

BRANDON looks at her She looks away

BRANDON resumes staring She looks back through the bodies
of commuters We see their eyes looking at each other

Their seduction continues through the collage of colors and
bodies
INT OFFICE - BOARDROOM DAY

BRANDON sits in a packed meeting room a pitch just audible
DAVID FISHER early late 40s BRANDONs boss a kind of
white noise and yet-

DAVID (0S)
I find you disgustingI find you
inconsolableI find you invasive

The IT TECHNICIAN just visible wheeling a cart away with
BRANDONs computer

DAVID (CONTD)
That is what the cynics used to
sayCompanies would refuse to look
to the futureTheyd say “Can we
stop this virus

The scratch of a pencil against paper-

BRANDON sits distracted facing COLLEAGUE 1 MARIANNE
midlate 20s seated further along the table steals a look
at BRANDON

A glass door opens-

The PRETTY ASSISTANT brings in coffee sliding down a cup in
front of BRANDON

DAVID(OS) (CONTD)
As if it was a negative
progression a descent into hell
moving with stealth amongst those
you need to affect growing more
and more with a momentum that is
unstoppable

BRANDON looks across the hall distracted by the IT
TECHNICIAN who is replacing the computer in his office

DAVID (CONTD)
Now some inane kid snorting the
entire load of his mothers spice
cupboard and posts that on You
Tube They would watch as it would
become the buzzword amongst high
school kids everywhere
Eventuallytheir cynicism would
turn to awe

9 INT FRONT DOOR APARTMENT NIGHT 9

BRANDON to the front door and opens it to reveal an
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (ALEXA)

BRANDON
Hi

ALEXA
Hi

BRANDON
Come in

BRANDON steps aside to let the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in She walks
into the apartment as he closes the door

BRANDON (CONTD)
Drink

ALEXA

No thank you

BRANDON picks up money from the table and give it to ALEXA
She counts it and nods to BRANDON

ALEXA (CONTD)
Perfect

ALEXA puts the money in her bag

BRANDON
This Way

BRANDON gestures to his room ALEXA turns and walks away
BRANDON follows

10 INT BEDROOM APARTMENT NIGHT
A tidy bedroom-

BRANDON lies on the bed watching waiting ALEXA starts to

take her top off

BRANDON
Slowly

ALEXA continues slowly tosses it aside and continues taking
off her bra and panties Finally putting her earrings on the
bedside table BRANDON reaches up to pull her onto the bed
INT APARTMENT MORNING 11
The SOUND of BRANDON getting up-

The SOUND of blinds being raised-

CLOSE UP of a discarded earring on the carpet

BRANDON padding naked along a corridor

The SHARP TONE of the answer machine flicked on in passing-
Audible from the corridor-

FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE
Hey its me

We hear BRANDON turn on the shower

FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE
(CONT D)
Pick Up Pick Up

BRANDON walks towards the kitchen and we hear him pour a

glass of water

FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE
(CONT D)

BRANDON crosses the hall and enters the toilet
FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE
(CONT D)

BRANDON turns on the light puts down his glass and urinates

FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE
(CONTD)

Brandon Brandon (louder)
Brandon Urghhh
BRANDON finishes flushes toilet steps off screen
FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE
(CONTD)

DEAD TONE
The CALLER hangs up

BRANDON re-appears and closes the bathroom door

INT BATHROOM APARTMENT DAWN 12

BRANDON in the shower a sense of movement his hand barely
visible moving back and forth

The fall of the shower-

BRANDON stands letting the water wash over him

INT SUBWAY DAWN 13

BRANDON sits looking over at the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL sitting
opposite-

The train moves on after a while stopping at another
platform

PEOPLE get on PEOPLE get off

BRANDONs eyes travel down over the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRLs legs
and up-

She opens them a little the dip of her skirt sinking deep
between her thighs-

She looks up senses BRANDON watching She lets her fingers
fall in her lap

BRANDON shifts a little in his seat to get a better look
through the crowd Suddenly she stands and makes her way to
the train door Hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole

for stability revealing a wedding ring

BRANDONs hand reaches for the pole too touching her as he
stands behind her There is a gentle unison contact
BRANDONs breath heavy on her neck Both are frozen to the
spot caught in a mutual moment

INT SUBWAY MORNING 14

The train door bolts open and the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL
disembarks BRANDON is blocked by a MALE PASSENGER as he gets
out in quick pursuit of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL

BRANDON is several paces behind now pursues She turns left
into a stairwell

Its almost like fighting a downward river People are
walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the
PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL

The tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs A
moment later BRANDON reaches the summit to be greeted by a
wrought-iron gate

He looks left at one staircase People ascend

He looks right at another staircase Other passengers ascend
People come in and out of the turnstiles on the right-hand
side He has lost her A sudden moment of disappointment

crosses his face

He descends the staircase dejected

INT OFFICE DAY 15

BRANDON walks into his office and to his desk stops in his
tracks heart thumping-

A bare space where BRANDONs computer once was and next to it
a replacement computer A pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck
to the screen

INT CUBICLE MENS TOILETS OFFICE DAY 16

BRANDON walks into a toilet cubicle shuts and locks the
door He cleans the seat with toilet paper flushes stands

and starts to masturbate

of the other door and hurries over to open the door for her

WOMAN comes out nodding her thanks

INT APARTMENT NIGHT 19

BRANDON looks through his vast record collection and
carefully puts a disk on the record player

INT KITCHEN APARTMENT NIGHT 20

The chink of beer bottles banging up against one another as
BRANDON opens the fridge door-

BRANDON peers in considering the left over take out resting
on the shelf He takes it out flipping open a bottle of beer
in a familiar move and banging the door shut with his back

A flyer for an fancy take out flaps under a magnet on the
fridge door

INT LIVING ROOM APARTMENT NIGHT 21

A comfortable apartment-—

BRANDON spoons Chinese take out into his mouth sliding down
in front a laptop resting on his desk

Music continues to surround the apartment

The bright serenade of his laptop opening BRANDON resumes
fingers absently tapping the keyboard-

A distant whir of a car alarm far off

INT LIVING ROOM APARTMENT NIGHT 22
BRANDON in the dark watching pornography on his laptop-
BRANDONs cell phone rings He ignores it

And then steady monotonous ring of a telephone close by
BRANDON barely wavers as it clicks onto answer machine-

The HEAVY DEAD TONE of the answer machine as the callers
message kicks in-

FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE

OKee MeagainIm dyingI

BRANDON smiles-

The shake of cocktails mixed-

BRANDON shakes his head and looks down

BRANDON

Unbelievable

DAVID (OVER)
Ah (LAUGHS)

DAVID and BRANDON look around the room

DAVID and BRANDON are fortunate to be here The clink of
glasses the noise of laughter waft through the room

Across the room a familiar face

Her wavering a little at first on seeing BRANDON across the
room Their eyes lock
She smiles with quiet surprise-

BRANDON looks away ignoring SISSYs gaze not wanting to
look at her SISSY plays on inwardly crestfallen her
fingers working across the piano keys

DAVID leans back eyes grazing over SISSY a kind of white
noise to SISSYs beautiful music-

The seeping first bars of “New York New York filtering
through-

SISSY
(singing)
Start spreading the news Im
leaving today I want to be a part
of it New YorkNew York

Its a familiar song but in SISSYs hands every word
punctures like an emotional fireburst-

SISSYs voice is oddly haunting underscoring the bubble of
conversation

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
I want to wake up in a city that
doesnt sleep And find Im king of
the hill top of the heap

SISSYs eyes dart back to BRANDON seemingly lost in his
conversation but competing now with SISSY and her song-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
My little town blues-

Suddenly SISSYs fingers drop from the piano her whole body
curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic
slowly but quietly captivating-

SISSY (CONTD)
Theyre melting away I gonna make
a brand new start of it

Even DAVIDs listening now-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
In old New York

SISSYs up moving now she is completely lost in the song and
the room is coming with her-

BRANDON concedes looking back at SISSY now holding the room

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
If I can make it there-

A kind of hushed still has descended-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
Ill make it anywhere Its up to
youNew york New york New York
New York-

SISSY comes closer walking between the tables flirting and
laughing and drawing the audience in until they are in the
palm of her hand

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
I want to wake up ina city that
never sleepsAnd find Ima
number one-

SISSY grazes past BRANDONs table eyes catching on BRANDON
singing for him now-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
Top of the list king
of the hill-

BRANDON drinks not looking at SISSY She closes her eyes
tears stinging reeling back into herself-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
A number one

SISSY draws out the note bringing the song momentarily to a

silence-

SISSYs misty eyes open as BRANDON at last looks at her the
moment oddly fragile between them brutal and yet tender
Even DAVID sensing something until-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
These little town blues-

SISSY turns makes her way back to the piano enjoying it now-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
Are melting away

Fingers touching the keys once more masterfully picking up
and improvising with the last few bars-

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
Im gonna make a brand new start of
it - in old
New York

SISSY leans back She is on fire now singing with every
fibre of her heart and soul like no other rendition heard

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
And if I can make it there Im
gonna make it
anywhere Its up to you-

SISSY holds BRANDON with a voice a sudden flickering emotion
threatening to topple her somehow in SISSYs hands this song
is heartbreaking

SISSY (CONTD)
(singing)
New york New york
(quieter now)
New York New York
(even quieter)
New york New york
(almost to a whisper)
New york New york

SISSY strikes one last note lost deep within herself-
HUSHED SILENCE-

DAVID
Wow Wow Bravo
Sudden APPLAUSE CHEERS OVERWHELMING-

DAVID turns to BRANDON

DAVID (CONTD)
(LAUGHS) Shes good Shes good
BRANDON looks away eyes filling with tears

BRANDON puts down his drink blotting his coaster with the
imprint of the deep red rim of his glass-

Hes the only one not applauding

BRANDON doesnt want to hear BRANDON stands back against a
wall as if transfixed as if he cannot take any more His
breathing is irregular Something of the past has come to the
present All of his distractions have now stopped and he is
at once confronted with himself

His face bears the pain of something long passed but
visually present This wound has not healed

Jolting himself out of his trance BRANDON hurriedly heads
out into the corridor-

The sound of movement in the bathroom

A lone condom disregarded on the floor

We see his bedside drawer ajar

He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut

Eventually she turns and walks out

EXT PIER HUDSON RIVER NIGHT 63

BRANDON stands at the end of a long pier looking out toward
the Hudson River the LAP of murky water audible He hovers
for a moment and considers then slowly makes his way back
to the main road

The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond

EXT NEAR STANDARD HOTEL NIGHT 64

Above the tall endless glass of The Standard Hotel scored
with a honeycomb of windows randomly illuminated like tiny
still lives

BRANDON comes to a corner lights a cigarette and leans
Above him engraved in stone is 1949 He looks up toward
the tall building which appears like a Stasi East Berlin
building Stark and authoritative

A KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor
window a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away

A WOMAN early 30s phone to her ear dressed in black jeans
and t-shirt paces along the window Catching sight of
BRANDON she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass

A MAN stares blankly out clearly fresh in on a flight and
jet lagged enjoying the view two floors up

A FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of
cleaning makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy
duster

And then BRANDON sees her-

A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands naked her body pressed against
the floor to ceiling glass high up overlooking the Hudson
River The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN
behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up

fuck

BRANDON hesitates quiet fascination flickering across his
face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDONs eyes lock
with the MIDDLE AGED WOMANs dead gaze standing high above-
A CAR HORN LOUD UNREMITTING-

BRANDON turns his hypnotism broken Its as if he comes back
to himself

EXT STREET NEAR RESTAURANT NIGHT 65
A distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street-
MARIANNE waiting inside the bar seated with a drink
clearly there for some time Her eyes checking the room with
quiet concern

BRANDON steals a moment eyes tracing over-
MARIANNEs fingers playing with the edge of her menu-

An ring indent around her wedding finger the shrink of skin

Pulling off his jacket-

jacket takes his bag heads towards the living room He
spies all SISSYs crap spilling out across the floor-

He sighs

Heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge

INT CORRIDOR APARTMENT NIGHT 70

The lock of the front door rotates Someone is entering the
apartment

Darkness-
SISSY bursts through the door in a hurry

After a moment the bathroom door opens cutting a slit of
light into the darkness

From the blackness we see BRANDON framed masturbating in
front of the bathroom sink

SISSY shocked stands with her hand still on the door
handle transfixed by a naked BRANDON

As BRANDON instinctively turns SISSY runs from view
SISSY slams the door shut

BRANDON (0S)
Oh Fuck

bewilderment and deep embarrassment

Slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage He hits
the wall in frustration

INT BATHROOM APARTMENT NIGHT 72
BRANDON locks the bathroom door
He exhales letting the moment slowly pass until-

SISSY (0C)
Brandon-

BRANDON lowers himself onto the floow desperately struggling
with his emotions-

He closes his eyes eyelashes fragile and flickering until-
BRANDON opens them reaches a hand out almost mechanically
turns up the shower the room now swirling in steam trying

to drown SISSYs voice out

SISSY (OS) (CONTD)

Brandon Im sorry

BRANDON closes his eyes tears pricking-

INT LIVING ROOM APARTMENT NIGHT 73
SISSY walking back from kitchen resigned-
BRANDONs laptop on and open on his desk

SISSY approaches it sinking down in front of the illuminated
laptop

She absently taps the mouse dragging open a series of held
windows the shifting lights of the screen cast across her
face revealing-

Slowly SISSYs face changes a blurred smorgasbord of porn
sites graphic and obscene their colors reflecting across
her face and body An escalating collage of graphic images
obscene sexual messages and a provocative sexual conversation
hanging mid sentence addressed to a live sex chatroom The
images haunting brutal from the weird to the
sadomasochistic The open windows an endless stacking of
obscene chatroom conversation emails posted with graphic
sexual photos and live webcam images of every combination of
fucking disappearing into the screen in infinite form

SISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued-

Suddenly a voice from the screen images briefly glimpsed a
woman legs splayed-

FROM SCREEN
Hey wheres Brandon Are you
Brandons girlfriend Do you want
to play

SISSY looks closer mildly appalled
FROM SCREEN (CONTD)
Do you wanna play with my tits I
know Brandon would really like it
And I know exactly what Brandon
likes

BRANDON picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom

SISSY takes her coat and leaves the apartment

INT BEDROOM APARTMENT NIGHT 74
LATER-
The thump of music-

BRANDON sitting on the edge of his bed the pumping music
from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder
hands grasping his hair Then suddenly he enters the whole
contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag

Then BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment a
black garbage bag in his hand dumping pieces of paper post
it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone
numbers on the back

BRANDON moves on picking up anything he can find An old
jacket elbows worn A handful of old t-shirts

He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy grabbing
more crap along the way one of SISSYs dirty thongs on the
floor He picks it up moving on

INT KITCHEN APARTMENT NIGHT 75
An open fridge-

BRANDON tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by
date mush into the bag

Cans of Red Bull crappy cereals jam with mould on top an
old joint magazines all get dumped on route

BRANDON heads out picking up more detritus along the way
old pens an old cellphone a pair of defunked headphones-

A pile of porn mags in a cupboard pulled out as he heads
down along the corridor

INT LIVING ROOM APARTMENT NIGHT 76
BRANDON strips the room pulling out an old pair of sneakers
smelling and cracked from under a chair He peers up looks

around the room almost bare-

His laptop resting on his desk BRANDON stops considers
initially resistant and then something finally compels him to

do it-

He picks up the laptop yanking the plug hard from the wall
Dumping it inside the garbage bag he moves on picking up an
ipod a gameboy ipod nano wires and cables and stuff
Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage he drags the
heaving bag of crap out into the corridor

The SLAM of the front door-

EXT STREET OUTSIDE APARTMENT NIGHT 77

BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment heaving the
swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on
the sidewalk A pile of black garbage bags already piled up
along the street in waiting for collection

Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands walks by
the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk

A SIREN goes past-
The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS

BRANDON heads back up to his apartment shutting the door
firmly

INT BRANDONS OFFICE DAY 78

BRANDON now the voyeur looks across the room into
MARIANNEs office He studies her almost like prey The
moment seems to last a lifetime There is much want in
BRANDONs face but from this distance seems unobtainable

Suddenly and without any warning BRANDON walks into his
dream entering MARIANNEs office and pulls her behind a
partition kissing her unapologetically and passionately

She responds startled but happy to be taken She
surrenders

They pull away looking at one another She smiles
laughing his spirit infectious drawing her on

BRANDON
Come on

BRANDON leads MARIANNE away

Watching MARIANNE at the window

MARIANNE
The view is amazing

BRANDON approaches nervously standing next to her

BRANDON
Hey

MARIANNE leans up and kisses BRANDON

MARIANNE
(LAUGHS)

MARIANNE takes BRANDONs hand and leads him to the bed We
see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender
touches

MARIANNE caresses BRANDONs face and kisses both his eyes
BRANDON attempts to do the same to MARIANNE slowly but
surely This ritual becomes more aroused clothes start to
fall away revealing for the first time both each others
flesh

BRANDON rolls up her skirt laughs at her panites MARIANNE
giggles

BRANDON
(LAUGHS) Are they vintage

MARIANNE
A little bit (LAUGHS)

The ritual begins to get more passionate as they feel for
each others breasts and thighs

At the height of this passionate encounter BRANDONs
attention strangely slowly starts to fade Its as if the
intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him

He recoils unable to continue

Both lie on their backs silently in frustration breathing
heavily MARIANNEs face is one of puzzlement and hurt She
looks at BRANDON for some kind of answer He gets up
MARIANNE unsure what to do sits up and pulls down her
skirt adjusts her hair

INT BEDROOM STANDARD HOTEL DAY

INT BAR NIGHT 89
Earlier that night-
BRANDON sits drinks alone at the bar-

An OLDER GUY paws a GAUNT YOUNG WOMAN plying her with drinks
knocking them back much to his delight

BRANDON watches catching the eye of a girl (CARLY) walking
towards the bar her friends playing pool-

spilling out of her T-shirt

Through the glass a heaving bar BRANDON considers on the

edge until-

He suddenly crosses the street narrowly avoiding a taxi
streaking past

The grey snake of a subway coming up from under ground-

BRANDON stands on a platform Its not the rush hour yet

The RATTLE of the subway pulling in-

BRANDON boards the train

INT TRAIN SUBWAY DAWN
A virtually empty car-
BRANDON sits-

A COLUMBIAN WOMAN across the car head lent against the
window half asleep clearly at the end of a long shift

Above a poster of a sunny shiny family advertising LIFE
INSURANCE -

BRANDONs eyes graze over the poster-

He stands his reflection mirrored back at him preparing for

his stop-
The train SCREECHES to a sudden halt-
Wheels SCREECHING along the track-

The COLUMBIAN WOMAN wakes-

A YOUNG STUDENT plugged headphone on looks up from reading

her book
BRANDON inwardly curses
The train sits in the station Doors not opening

The silence at last punctured by the SHRILL hum of the
intercom-

INTERCOM
Ladies and Gentlemen at this time
due to a police investigation we

have to discharge this train
Please follow the conductor to the
rear of the train
The long low PING of the intercom fading out-
They wait And wait in silence
BRANDON leans his head against the glass closes his eyes a

hangover kicking in

The other few commuters in the carriage sit awkwardly
wondering why the doors arent opening in the station
Details of the carriage appear

Half-drunken cup of coffee

An old New York POST

Graffiti on all the car windows

They wait

Suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way
through the carriage that BRANDONs in with the CONDUCTOR

ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end

CONDUCTOR (0S)
Watch your step between cars

Passengers asking Whats going on

BRANDON finally makes his way down with the other passengers
to the last carriage As he steps out he looks down to his
far left and sees a POLICE CAUTION LINE being unraveled and

ENGINEERS and FIREMEN making their way to the far front of
the train

A WOMANs shoes like Sissys earlier at the Boom Boom Room

The intermittent WHIR of sirens-

BRANDON emerging from the subway already reaching for his

Beyond the glow of an ambulance-
BRANDON keeps walking heading off up the road quietly

distracted He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his
ear

The PULSE of a distant phone ringing-
The answer machine kicks in-

BRANDON flicks it off slips it back in his pocket BRANDON
picks up his pace

He flicks out his phone again Tries again-

ANSWER MACHINE (CONTD)
This is Sissyleave a me-

BRANDON is running now heart beating fast now breath
quickening a seeping panic threatening to unleash-

BRANDON
Shit

SUDDENLY he makes a dash for it weaving through the sidewalk
at pace
INT BRANDONS BUILDING - LOBBY DAWN 104
His finger repeatedly presses the elevator button as if by
doing so will make it arrive quicker

INT BRANDONS BUILDING - ELEVATOR DAWN 105
BRANDON enters into the elevator The door shuts immediately
behind him
INT BRANDONS BUILDING - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE APARTMENT DAWN

Exiting BRANDON heads along the faceless corridor reaching
his front door

He is already pulling out his keys and pushing them into the
door with growing dread-

INT CORRIDOR APARTMENT DAWN 107

The sound of running water from the bathroom BRANDON stops
with relief leaning his forehead against the bathroom door
letting himself exhale-

BRANDON
Sissy-

SILENCE-

BRANDON hesitates a seeping concern pricking his skin-

INT BATHROOM APARTMENT DAWN 108
BRANDON walks into the bathroom freezing on seeing-

SISSY sunk on the floor wedged between the bathroom and the
toilet-

The pump of blood seeping from her wrists already pooled
across the floor-

BRANDON reaches for SISSY gripping her wrists deep slashes
scissoring the veins the flap of skin flaying-

BRANDON pushes the fat of his thumb on each slash blood
seeping between his fingers-—

BRANDON looks at her wrist every time he moves his fingers
he releases the pressure the blood flows

BRANDON grips them tighter a quiet determination to stop the
bleeding-

The skid of blood underfoot BRANDON cradles her in his arms
grappling with his phone desperately calling 911

BRANDON desperately holds her cradled between his legs his
fingers pressing her wrists temporarily stemming the flow of
blood the phone wedged between shoulder and chin

The slip of SISSYs wrist through BRANDONs fingers He slams
down the phone struggling to hold her in his grasp She

slips again

INT HOSPITAL DAY 109

BRANDON head bowed Sitting by Sissys bedside-

SISSY lies sleeping skin white strapped to a drip The
gentle rise and fall of her breath

BRANDONs gaze falling on SISSY lying in the hospital bed
her wrists bandaged

BRANDON eyes falling on the scars covering her arms He
reaches out a hand on the edge of touching them letting his
fingers hover over them until finally-

A FINGER lightly outlines a snaking scar seeping up her arm
She stirs a little but-

SISSYs eyes just opening focusing on him until-
SISSY

(murmuring)
Shithead

Relief overwhelming BRANDON he laughs exhales on the edge
BRANDON turns to stroke SISSYs hair rests his head next to
hers She sleeps again

110 EXT WATERFRONT HUDSON RIVER DUSK 110

BRANDON now walking along the side of the river railings
seemingly speeding up his journey

Beyond the shadowy black figures of a broken jetty stretch
out toward the open river
111 EXT DOCK HUDSON RIVER DUSK 111
The endless grey of the Hudson River close now-
BRANDON walking along a concrete jetty-

A rusting building oxidized and stained salt green edging
along the jetty until-

BRANDON reaches the edge of the jetty looking out-

The LAP of grey water beneath

BRANDON stands a hangover kicking in-

And at once BRANDON is crying the tears flowing slow at
first until they rush like floodgates opening He reaches

for breath trying to stifle the howls emanating from his
body inconsolable now flooded with emotion-

BRANDON sinks squat to the ground buckled in two body

shuddering
The LAP of the water steady now-

BRANDON sobs and sobs and sobs a mess of snot and tears as
he looks out over the wide sweep of the Hudson River

Far off the drone of the freeway the early evening trawl of
traffic kicking in-

The froth of the tide back and forth rising and breaking
back and forth

INT PLATFORM SUBWAY MORNING 112

BRANDON stands in his familiar spot on the platform waiting
for the train that will take him to work Wearing a vacant
face the train pulls into the station BRANDON boards

He takes a seat automatically as if pre-programmed The
train leaves the platform

INT TRAIN SUBWAY MORNING 113

Looking into no mans land BRANDON feels the heat of
someones gaze As he instinctively looks up to respond a
mixture of surprise fear excitement and doubt across his
face

The PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL who we met at the beginning of our
story is staring down at BRANDON this time in a more
engaging fashion She looks because she wants to be looked
at

Again a dance begins This time she leads Engaged active
decisive

BRANDONs face is fractured into many conflicting emotions
Its as if a magnet is drawing him in but at the same time
hes trying to resist

At this moment the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL stands up eyeing
BRANDON as she makes her way to the door blocking BRANDON as
the train pulls in to her stop

INT PLATFORM SUBWAY MORNING 114
The train pulls away from the station and disappears into the
tunnel We do not know if BRANDON is still aboard or has

succumbed to his urges

115 THE END 115
