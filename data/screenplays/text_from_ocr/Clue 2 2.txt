He leads them all into the LIBRARY
(NOTE)

The scenes that follow may initially seem somewhat long-

winded verbal and therefore slow The speed of these

scenes cannot be judged by the usual criteria WADSWORTHs
explanation of what has happened so far will be played at

an absolutely TREMENDOUS speed whenever hyphenated the words
spoken so fast that they may be completely unintelligible

His actions will illustrate the words and thus make them
comprehensible to the audience but they will also happen

at tremendous speed

The result will be something like an under-cranked speeded
up section -- except that it will not be under-cranked

and will be done by the acting of WADSWORTH It will be

a comic tour-de-force

So you made a mistake

I did not

WADSWORTH
Why not admit it

MISS SCARLET
Doctors like the Pope never
admit a professional mistake or
a sexual indiscretion

WADSWORTH
If you didnt make a mistake
you were lying -- which looks
very bad for you

PROFESSOR PLUM stares at the ring of accusing faces
He shrugs

PROFESSOR PLUM
Okay I made a mistake

WADSWORTH
Right But if so why was Mr
Boddy pretending to be dead --
it could only be because he
realized that his scheme had
misfired and that the gunshot
was intended to kill him --not
me © Look

He pulls MR BODDYs head forward and points to his ear
There is a slight graze on it (This should have been
visible to the highly observant viewer sometime earlier
in the film)

WADSWORTH
(continuing)
The bullet grazed his ear Clearly
his best hope of escaping death was
to pretend to be dead already

So you could be the murderer

WADSWORTH laughs
WADSWORTH

Dont be ridiculous If I was the
murderer why would I reveal to you
how I did it

No one has an answer for this So they nod

MR GREEN
Well who else knew about
this secret passage

COLONEL MUSTARD
We found it Miss Scarlet and me

MISS SCARLET
You found it You could have known
about it all along

COLONEL MUSTARD
But I didnt

MRS PEACOCK
Why should we believe you

He has no answer to that But WADSWORTH has

WADSWORTH
Because he was definitely with us all in
the Billiard Room doorway while Yvette
‘was screaming Dont you remember

She nods

MISS SCARLET
Thats true He was next to me

They all fall silent staring at each other with mutual
suspicion

MRS PEACOCK
But what I dont understand is why
was the Cook murdered She had
nothing to do with Mr Boddy

and
i

and

Ue

WADSWORTH
Of course she did I gathered
you all here together because
you were all implicated in
Mr Boddys dastardly blackmail
Did none of you deduce that the
others were involved too

What others

WADSWORTH
The Cook And Yvette

They are all amazed

ALL
No

WADSWORTH
Thats how he got all his information
Before he could blackmail anyone
Mr Boddy had to find out their guilty
secret The Cook and Yvette were his
accomplices

COLONEL MUSTARD
I see So whoever knew that the
Cook was involved killed her

WADSWORTH
Yes I know -- because I was Mr
Boddys butler -- that the Cook
had worked for one -of you

Who

WADSWORTH
Can you keep a secret

COLONEL MUSTARD
Yes

WADSWORTH
So can I

MRS WHITE speaks with mounting excitement

MRS WHITE
I begin to see how it was done

MRS PEACOCK
Was it a plot between them
Wadsworth or did Colonel

-Mustard do it alone

COLONEL MUSTARD reacts

WADSWORTH

‘We shall see Lets look at the

other murders

Motorist that he arrived at that
moment

WADSWORTH
It wasnt luck I invited him

WADSWORTH

Of course Its obvious Everyone

here tonight was either Mr Boddys

victimor accomplice Everyone who

has died gave him vital information

about one of you I got them here

so that theyd give evidence against
him and force him to confess

“MISS SCARLET
“So who knew the guy who came
to make the telephone call

WADSWORTH waits a moment Then COLONEL MUSTARD Speaks
again

COLONEL MUSTARD
He was my driver during the war

WADSWORTH —
And what was he holding over you
Ne (a beat)
SP Or do I have to tell them
COLONEL MUSTARD
He knew I was a war profiteer
I stole essential Air Force radio
Spare parts and sold them-on the
black market Thats where I made all my money
(emotionally)
But that doesnt make me a
murderer
MRS PEACOCK
A lot of our airmen died because their
radios didnt work Was the-Policeman
working for Mr Boday too
MISS ‘SCARLET

The cop was from Washington He
was in my pay I bribed him once

Colonel Mustards suggestion that
we split up and search the house

MRS PEACOCK’
Thats right it was Colonel
Mustards suggestion

‘PROFESSOR PLUM
And after we split up there were
‘Lour more murders

COLONEL MUSTARD makes no reply He just stares at them
maintaining a dignified silence

- WADSWORTH
‘And whose suggestion was it to
lock the Motorist in the-Lounge

MR GREEN
(remembering)
Colonel Mustard wasnt it

WADSWORTH
(grimly)
Indeed So then we drew lots
we split up -- and one of us
got away from his or her

and pretended he was dead so that

when you did it The other four
murders were easy -- luck was on your

side you drew lots to search the

all occupied searching the rest of the

PROFESSOR PLUM

I think there is Wadsworth
aknew about the secret
Passayes And

He crosses to the Kitchen table

PROFESSOR PLUM
(continuing) ‘
when we drew lots you held
the matchsticks in your hand --
you could have made sure we
went to the Cellar together

MR GREEN
(excitably)
Its a frame-up

WADSWORTH
(angrily)
No it isnt

PROFESSOR PLUM remains calm He smiles

PROFESSOR PLUM
Ill tell you how we find out The
guns missing right Everybody

WADSWORTH suddenly produces the gun from his pocket

WADSWORTH
Very clever Professor

The OTHERS stand back aghast MISS SCARLET stares
at WADSWORTH

MISS SCARLET
You killed that girl

PROFESSOR PLUM
(quietly)
He killed all of them

MR GREEN is one step behind

MR GREEN
He did
PROFESSOR PLUM
Of course Who knew every detail
‘about us all Who brought us
all here and Mr Boddy and all
the victims Who had the key to
the cupboard with the weapons

COLONEL MUSTARD steps forward thinking furiously

COLONEL MUSTARD
BUT -- he said the Cook was murdered
when we all were standing in the
Library doorway with Yvette So it
couldnt have been Wadsworth -- he
was there beside me

WADSWORTH smiles

WADSWORTH

(smoothly)
But I was lying Thats not
when she was murdered I killed
the Cook earlier on when Mr Boddy
was on the floor in the Study and
you were all clustered around him
It took no time at all You see as
Professor Plum realized I knew about
the secret passage from the study
to the Kitchen

MRS WHITE
Well the policell be here any
minute -- youll never get away
with this

(C) 173 WADSWORTH
(smiling)
Why should the police come
Nobodys called them

MISS SCARLET
(a sudden realization)
Oh my God of course not

- MRS WHITE
Why did you do it

WADSWORTH
Would you believe me if I said
it was to rid the world of an
appalling blackmailer and his
disgusting informers
MR GREEN
No

WADSWORTH
(cheerfully) -
And youd be quite right No
- all my life has been spent in a
struggle for perfection I tried
‘to be the perfect husband but my 7
wife killed herself I strove to
be the perfect butler but I was
‘driven to killing mv employer So
I resolved that in doing -so I
would commit the perfect murder
But there is no pleasure in my
triumph without an audience to

admire it -- and as‘none of you
had the brains to expose me I
decided I must expose myself

COLONEL MUSTARD
Good God man there are ladies
present

PROFESSOR PLUM
But you didnt commit the perfect
murder There are six witriesses
to your confession

WADSWORTH
Not for long Professor When the
police eventually get here theyll
find twelve bodies -- and no

You said before that that was

WADSWORTH
(enigmatically)
I have my methods

COLONEL MUSTARD
When did she kill Mr Boddy

WADSWORTH

When I said We all ran to the

Kitchen to see the Cook ‘She
stayed behind in the Study for
a moment to check that Mr Boddy
was dead He opened his eyes so
she hit him on the head with the
candlestick and dragged him to
the toilet

MISS SCARLET
Why

WADSWORTH
To create confusion

PROFESSOR PLUM
Why did she do it

WADSWORTH
(menacingly)
Because she was acting under
orders From the person who
later ‘killed her
ALL
WHO

WADSWORTH looks at COLONEL MUSTARD

would be implicated if you were
exposed

MISS SCARLET

herring Like all members of the
oldest profession Im a capitalist
I shall sell my secrets -- your

‘secrets -- to the highest bidder

COLONEL MUSTARD
And if we dont cooperate

MISS SCARLET
Then just like Mr Boddy I
shall expose you

PROFESSOR PLUM
But we can expose you Six
murders

MISS SCARLET
I hardly think it will enhance your
reputation at the UN Professor Pium
if it is revealed that you have been
implicated not only in adultery with
a-patient but in her death and the
deaths of five other people
