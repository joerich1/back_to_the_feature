ASSASSINS

Written by

Larry and Andy Wachowski

August 12 1994

FADE IN
PERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK

We know that we are looking at something because its
polished surface shimmers with light

PULLING BACK other squares are revealed the black and
white tiles of a chess board

The board rises and spins slipping beneath us we find
ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board MOVING THROUGH a chess
game

The pieces are everywhere checking and covering other
pieces It has reached that critical moment when pieces
are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies

unravel towards a final outcome

Standing above the pieces around him we see the black
king

We MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face CLOSER TO his chiseled
ebony features CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold
black eyes

DISSOLVE TO
EXT MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK

The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens

Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-
less marsh It is fall the first frost not far away and
the foliage is brown and bare With the red-orange ball
of fire melting into the horizon the two men at first
appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
mire

The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man
He is very well-dressed in a dark suit A 22 caliber
gun fitted with a long silencer dangles from his hand

His name is ROBERT RATH

The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM He is also wearing a
very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
brambles and mud

As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the
mud

KETCHAM
Aw-shit

He balances on one leg holding his silk-socked foot in
the air He looks at the shoe already filling with mud
He looks at Rath

KETCHAM
How much farther

RATH
Just a little ways Up to those
trees

About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
is a small cluster of trees

KETCHAM
Oh fuck it

He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud
He smiles It feels good He hurls the sock Lifting
his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that He
grabs for the other sock struggling to get it off
laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud

Rath waits a faint smile

He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
both feet into the dark wet earth

KETCHAM
Hey this feels kinda good

They move on Ketcham almost playing sinking his feet
deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING SUCKING NOISE

KETCHAM
Hey do you mind if I talka
little I feel like I dont
know talking I guess

RATH
Sure

KETCHAM
Funny Ive never been a talker
My wife was always getting on me

about that Say what you feel
tell me whats bothering you
you ve got to talk to me I

never would though Not really

RATH
Why not

KETCHAM
I dont know Part of me wanted
to but part of me always said
‘Whats she going to be able to
do I dont know Maybe I
didnt trust her

He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
snowball

KETCHAM
My Margaret I loved her but you
know what I cheated on her All
the time I dont even know why
It wasnt the sex Margaret was
great in bed I think if I wasnt
married I wouldnt have even looked
at some of those women I knew she
couldnt trust me so how could I
trust her If she was here right
now Id think that I would tell her
that I was sorry ‘course if she
were here right now maybe I
wouldnt feel like talking

He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are
too far

KETCHAM
I think Ive heard of you

RATH
Its possible

KETCHAM
Youre pretty famous arent you

RATH
I hope not
KETCHAM
I know this may seem like a strange
question but can I ask you how
much the contract was for -- not
to insult you or anything I know
youre a professional but just
for me I was just wondering

RATH
Its a common question

KETCHAM
Oh yeah I guess we still need to
see that price tag Like art
right You hang some painting
that looks like baby-puke in your
living room only if it costs a

bundle

RATH
A dime

KETCHAM
One hundred thousand Thats it
Jesus Is that a lot

RATH
Average

KETCHAM
Shit oh well

Ketcham laughs
KETCHAM

I have been thinking about this
for a long while I knew this day
was coming I knew someday
someone would make the call on me
I never thought about anyone that
I had whacked What do you call
it anyway

RATH
Taken
KETCHAM
Taken Thats nice When I had

someone taken I would call our
General Contractor transfer the
money and as soon as I hung up the
phone I forgot about them

RATH
Everyone who plays the game knows
the rules
KETCHAM
Thats exactly what I told myself

Ketcham laughs again He is getting kind of giggly

hes high

Something

Hes laughing and Rath laughs with him Ketcham suddenly

stops laughing They are nearly to the cluster of trees

KETCHAM
I always wondered what Id be
thinking at this exact moment I
imagined that I would be thinking
about the fucker who contracted
this trying to figure out who
it was

occurs to him and he looks back at Rath

RATH
Dont know Thats how it works

KETCHAM
Thats what our General Contractor
told us but how can you trust
someone like that

RATH
Right

KETCHAM
I thought that I would be thinking
about Margaret or work or that
Id be having these deep profound
and depressing thoughts but Im
not Im trying to think really
profound thoughts but I cant
It seems very funny to me

RATH
What are you thinking about

KETCHAM
Im thinking about Moonpies Aint
that funny I havent hada
Moonpie since I was ten years old
Right now Im thinking how much
Id love one

RATH
And an RC

KETCHAM
Can I ask you something

RATH

like
Go ahead

KETCHAM
What do other guys do

He looks at the trees his voice dying in the WIND

RATH
Everyone handles it differently
Some are ready some are not

KETCHAM
Do they get down on their knees
begging and crying

RATH
Some

KETCHAM
When I thought about this that
was always there in the back of
my head that image of me on my
knees crying It wouldnt go
away and it would really upset me
It was something that I could never
get away from but now I feel
its okay I feel good

RATH
Can I ask you a question

KETCHAM
Anything

RATH
Why didnt you fade

KETCHAM
You mean quit

RATH
Yeah

KETCHAM

I used to think about it I had
Margaret She wanted kids I
thought about moving somewhere
far away like Europe I could
see all of that the first part
the getting away but I couldnt
see that next part Then what
So Id stop thinking about it and
go back to work You understand

RATH
Yeah
Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
trees

KETCHAM
I always pictured that I would end
in some land fill under
someone elses garbage I kept
picturing those plastic diapers
filled with some babys green shit
covering me But this is nice

He looks at the sun bloody red seeping into the black
horizon

KETCHAM
Look at that I havent watched
the sun set in a million years
Do you mind

RATH
No

Ketcham stares at the last of the light

KETCHAM
Nice real nice

With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry

Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun Rath
looks down at the gun limply held in his hand

When the sun is gone a red glow at the bottom of a dark-
ening sky we hear the GUN SILENCED ONCE then the BODY
FALLING INTO THE MUD After a beat we hear TWO MORE
SHOTS

Ketcham is lying face down already sinking into the mud
a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
left by the dying sun

Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly stand-
ing alone in the middle of nowhere

INT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

The room is dark and still

A man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the
amber wash of urban light

Snow is falling heavy white flakes glittering in the
citys electric night

The man finishes his bourbon ICE CLINKING in the empty
glass He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until
his forehead rests against the window
In the dim light we recognize the man as Rath

Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for
Christmas He watches the snowflakes drift to the
distant street below

He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself
fall when there is a KNOCK at the door

Crossing the room he opens the door Backlit by the
bright hallway light is a WOMAN She has already removed
her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see
that her dress is very short and very tight

ESCORT (WOMAN)
Hi Did you call --

RATH
Yes Please come in

Her HIGH HEELS TAP against the tile foyer as she enters
and he takes her coat

ESCORT
Goodness its so dark

She reaches for the wall switch but he stops her

RATH
I prefer it like this

ESCORT
How can a beautiful man like you
be shy
He smiles
RATH

I prefer it thats all

She moves closer to him the sexual confidence of her
body radiating like heat

ESCORT
Its okay honey We can do it
anyway you want

Rath is obviously uncomfortable

RATH
Would you like a drink

ESCORT
Id love one Whatever youre
having
They move into the room from a distance as featureless
as two shadows

She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a
city night

ESCORT
Beautiful

He hands her the drink Her smile is bright and perfect

ESCORT
Good will towards men

Their glasses clink as he drains half his drink If she
drinks at all we can not tell

RATH
Why are you working today

ESCORT
Holidays are our busiest days No
one likes to be alone on holidays
I know I dont

She touches his face the caress and her expression of
tenderness seemingly genuine

RATH
Youre very good at this arent
you

ESCORT

I think youre supposed to answer
that question

Her hand slides down his chest but before it goes any
farther Rath turns away returning to the bar

RATH
I know what you expect but I
dont want

He pours himself another drink

ESCORT
Thats okay hon I always expect
the unexpected

RATH
I called because I just want I
need to talk

She sits on the couch her body language changing as she
becomes a listener
RATH
Ive been thinking about my life
about things I have done What I
do for a living is in some ways
similiar to what you do

He sits on the other end of the couch his words thickened
by the alcohol

RATH

I know that everything has a
price I want you to understand
that Im willing to pay

He takes out an envelope and puts it between them She
picks it up glancing inside at a stack of hundred
dollar bills

ESCORT
For what

RATH
Honesty

She puts the envelope down
RATH
I just want to ask you some

questions

Uncomfortable she waits as he searches his drink for
the right words

RATH
Do you ever regret things youve
done

ESCORT

Everyone regrets something

RATH
But when you finLsh a job
afterwards do you think about
them

ESCORT
Sometimes

RATH
Do you think about their wives or
their families

ESCORT
No They call me I dont call
them If they didnt call I
wouldnt exist
Rath nods His next question is barely audible

RATH
Do you ever think about starting
over

ESCORT
All the time

RATH

Can you tell me about it

For the first time we really see her take a drink

closes her eyes

ESCORT
Sometimes I dream that I meet a
man this good honest man and we
fall in love I imagine us living
on a boat reading books sailing
to places where no one knows who
we were or cares what we did

She opens her eyes and looks at him

RATH
And what if you never meet that
man
She smiles
ESCORT

Then Ill sail alone

RATH
Do you believe that

ESCORT
Are you asking me if I believe in
another life

Rath nods

ESCORT
I have to

She finishes her drink

ESCORT
Is that all you want

RATH
Yes

She picks up the money and stands

RATH

She
Thank you

ESCORT
Anytime

INT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

It is the same room but now it is very cluttered room
service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about

He has been here for a while

He is sitting at the table staring intensely at a chess
game we see the board and all of the pieces set in the
same positions as in the opening sequence

He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and
then finishes off another bottle of bourbon

He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches
over the board and moves one of white knights taking a
black rook

A sequence begins obvious and he works through it moving
both the black and white pieces Suddenly he stops He
gets up and shifts to the other side of the board
studying the game from whites perspective

Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through
it as he moves around the table returning to his place
behind the black king

The games reaches its end as black is check-mated

He slumps down onto the table and looks across at the
white king

RATH
Fuck you Nick

INT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

Rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer
office a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with
cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax
machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer

On the table near the desk we see the 22 dismantled
and cleaned spread out on a white towel

He types in a complicated access code sequence then
waits staring at the blank screen

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
Where have you been Robert
RATHSCREEN
Sick The flu

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
I dont believe you

RATH
I dont give a fuck --

RATHSCREEN
Its true

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
I have been sitting on a contract
from Cleveland for six days
because of you

RATH
Fuck you fuck Cleveland and fuck
your contracts --

RATHSCREEN
I need a rest

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
Thats impossible Robert Youre
at the top of your field These
are the best contracts To stop
now would be self-destructive

He looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on
the table

RATHSCREEN
Send the file Ill have the
estimate tonight

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
Im worried about you Robert

RATH
You fucking should be --

RATHSCREEN
Dont be

On the screen the word Transmitting appears Rath
slowly gets out of his chair

The FAX MACHINE CLICKS and HUXS to life as a photograph
of a smiling old Italian man curls onto the desk

Rath begins destroying the hotel room smashing anything
he can get his hands on
INT HOTEL SUITE - DAY

Rath is in the middle of the room which he has
demolished Having showered and shaved he is now
standing naked in the midst of the rubble practicing
the slow and graceful art of Tai Chi

INT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Rath is working at the desk He is tallying numbers
materials totaling his estimate

Spread out over the table are several faxed photos of
the old Italian Leevio Valli usually surrounded by
bodyguards

The file details Vallis life and his daily routine It
includes phone bills credit card and bank account
statements driver license and vehicle registration the
real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his
income tax return

Satisfied with his figures Rath plugs the phone into the
modem and makes a call

The network comes on-line as the General Contractor
types

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
Youre too late Robert

Rath types

RATHSCREEN
What

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
The contract was stolen

Rath stares at the screen

RATHSCREEN
Who

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
A new player Hes using the name
Nicholai

The name hits Rath and he sits unable to breathe

CONTRACTOR SCREEN
You know what must be done

The screen goes black as the network shuts down

Rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts He lifts
a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant
appears every Friday The name of the restaurant has been
circled in red pen by Rath Trattoria Roma

EXT TRATTORIA ROMA - NIGHT

A red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian
restaurant

INT TRATTORIA ROMA

It is a large establishment with many tables and booths
The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian
families who have been eating here for years

Rath is sitting alone at a booth With very subtle
changes to his appearance he looks like an older Italian

In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine
He touches neither of them His eyes shift as he studies
the room

LEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five
gorillas in Italian suits The owner hurries to greet
them hugging kissing speaking only Italian

The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over-
sized booth in the back

Rath does not look twice at them Immediately he is
watching everyone else looking for the other assassin

Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit
around the table obscuring him from all parts of the
room

A wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and
fills their glasses A pretty waitress sets a steaming
loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in
front of Leevio He tells her something and she giggles
They joke in Italian watching her ass as she wiggles back
to the kitchen

At Leevios table the wine steward returns to fill their
glasses

It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first
to realize that it is not the same wine steward He is
the second assassin much younger than Rath His name is
BAIN He smiles

The goon reaches for his gun as --

Bain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face He
screams
Leevio coughs a spray of minestrone as a GUN flashes free
from the white linen towel hung over the stewards arm

It happens instantly FOUR SHOTS and the goons are dead
Leevio screams

LEEVIO
Dont

A FIFTH SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT
Leevios body falls forward and softly thuds on the table

Bain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON
from his belt expecting an attack

Facing the screaming crowd he begins to SHOOT anyone who
moves or stands men or women

There is chaos in the restaurant People scream falling
to the ground scrambling under tables

Bain is sweating his eyes shifting wildly from one end of
the room to the other

The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who
are sobbing

He moves through the room watching searching
BAIN
Dont anybody move You move
youre dead
He passes the table Rath was sitting at but it is empty
BAIN
Come on you chicken shit
motherfucker I know youre here
Lets go
EXT CONCRETE PARKING GARAGE
Across the street from Trattoria Roma Rath jacks together
a German assault rifle with night scope
INT TRATTORIA ROMA

Bain looks out the window at the dark street

He turns and searches through the people huddled on the
floor He aims his gun
BAIN
You Get up

A quivering wine steward stands
He points to another
BAIN

You too Up
EXT PARKING GARAGE
THROUGH the NIGHT SCOPE we see the front door to the
restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped
together slowly back out

INT TRATTORIA ROMA

Bain is second from the end both guns aimed at the
stewards

One of them begins to cry
BAIN
Not yet Dont move or youre
fucking dead

INT PARKING GARAGE

Rath moves the scope back and forth unable to pick out
the assassin

RATH
Shit Just do them all All of
them Shit

He cant pull the trigger

EXT TRATTORIA STOREFRONT
The group moves toward the street

BAIN
Now run

Like dogs out of the gate they bolt

INT PARKING GARAGE

Rath watches as they scatter finding Bain in his scope
EXT STREET

A chunk of BRICK EXPLODES from the wall just behind Bains
head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the
curb He laughs We get the idea that Bain is enjoying
this

INT PARKING GARAGE

Rath looks over his scope talking to himself He is
sweating

RATH
Shit What are you doing old man

Youre too fucking slow

He looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line
of cars

RATH
Okay Which one Which one is
yours

EXT CITY STREET

Bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars
staying low and out of sight

He works his way up to a black Mercedes that is parked
illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys
He hits the remote unlocking the doors

INT PARKING GARAGE

Rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope almost obscured
by the parked Mercedes

RATH
Amateur

He takes aim

EXT CITY STREET

Just as Bain starts to open the door the front TIRE
EXPLODES Another second the back TIRE EXPLODES

BAIN
Fuck

INT PARKING GARAGE
Rath waits steely calm his finger on the trigger

RATH
Your move

EXT CITY STREET

Bain hears the growing wail of
for a moment he opens the car
handled switchblade and a roll
the glove compartment

POLICE SIRENS Thinking
door and pulls a long
of electricians tape from

INT PARKING GARAGE

but cant make out what
GETTING LOUDER Theres a

Rath sees the car light go on
Bain is doing The SIRENS are
lot of them

EXT CITY STREET
Bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls

his shirt sleeve down From his pocket he takes out a
Gameboy and begins playing Tetris

INT PARKING GARAGE

Rath watches as the police
street

cars come racing down the

EXT CITY STREET

The CARS SCREECH to a halt
The COPS jump out drawing

Bain throws his guns down

in front of the restaurant
their weapons

raising his hands in the air

BAIN
Dont shoot Dont shoot

up

I give

More CARS come SCREECHING up as the two officers hold
their beads on Bain

COP
Hit the ground
your legs

Face down Spread

Bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him
frisking him In this position the Cop is unable to find
the knife strapped to Bains forearm but finds the
Gameboy
BAIN
Hey dont touch that

COP
Shut up

The Cop twists Bains arms behind his back handcuffing
him tightly

They drag him to his feet a swarm of police and
paramedics in the street

INT PARKING GARAGE

Rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the
police car but is unable to get a clean shot Bain is

using the cops for cover keeping his head low

RATH
Son of a bitch

The Cops shove Bain into the back seat

Rath very quickly walks to his car tossing his gun into
the trunk He gets in and STARTS the ENGINE

INT PATROL CAR

The two Officers are outside the car talking with the
sergeant

Bain laying low beneath the windows peeks up at the
adowy parking garage He smiles

id)

The two Policemen get in the car the second picking up
the radio The driver GUNS the ENGINE and the black and
white RUMBLES down the street

COP 2
This is 181 returning with suspect
involved in multiple shooting at
Trattoria Roma Repeat en route
with suspect

He hangs up the radio and looks back at Bain through the
metal caging

COP 2
Jesus Christ do you know who you
shot in there

Bain almost laughs

COP 2
What are you Some kind of a
hitman
Bain looks out the window

COP 2
You know what we call guys like you

Bain looks at him
COP 2

Sizzle lean Theyre gonna fry your

ass
He laughs at his own joke looking at his partner who
chuckles
EXT CITY STREET
Raths car races down the street trying to catch up with
the patrol car
INT PATROL CAR

Bain stares out the window silent

Behind his back he takes hold of his left thumb with his
right hand

The Cop is playing with the Gameboy

With a quick jerk he yanks the thumb out of its socket
His expression remains perfectly blank

The thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand The skin
stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his
wrist

The Cop turns as the SWITCHBLADE CLICKS and Bain sticks
the knife through the wire mesh into the cops eye A
font of blood arcs onto the windshield

Grabbing hold of the drivers shirt collar Bain jabs the
blade into the back of his neck

The driver screams trying to pull free of Bains grip

He slams on the brakes groping for his gun and the CAR
SKIDS out of control

Bain stabs the Cop again his GUN FIRING WILDLY as --

The patrol car starts to flip and roll

INT RATHS CAR
Rath turns as he hears an EXPLOSION several blocks away
The TIRES SQUEAL as he makes a hard right
EXT STREET

Orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned
patrol car Oil black clouds billow into the night sky

Raths car cruises past
Rath sees the back seat window shattered kicked out
Bain is gone
RATH
Im not done yet
EXT CITY STREET INTERSECTION
A brand new cab is sitting at a red light
The cabby looks into the rearview mirror as a pair of
headlights roll up behind him The car gets closer the

lights brighter they dont stop

He shrieks as the CAR SMASHES INTO HIS TEARING OFF HIS
BUMPER

The cabby jumps out rattling off a string of obscenities

Rath gets out of the white car starting to apologize as
the cabby moves toward him

When hes close enough Rath decks him knocking him
unconscious

He picks him up and puts him in the white car

Rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to
green he drives off

INT CAB

Rath circles the area turning up the cabs CB

A couple of CALLS CRACKLE through the speaker before he
hears what hes waiting for an airport fare in this area
At the intersection of Adams and Nine

He picks up the mike

RATH
This is 1242 I got it
EXT ADAMS AND NINE

It is a deserted intersection The buildings are dark and
some of the street lights are out

The cab sits by itself ENGINE RUNNING its taillights
glowing through the exhaust
INT CAB

Rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat His other
hand grips the door handle

As he waits watching the intersection he notices the
cabbys ID pinned to the dashboard

Leaving the gun in his jacket he reaches for the ID card
He rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the

seat the door behind him opens Someone gets in and
closes the door Rath peers into the rearview mirror

It is Bain

For the first time we realize that the front and back of
the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass

There is an awkward silence as Rath sits unsure
Bain looks at him

BAIN
Is there a problem

RATH
No No problem The airport
right

BAIN
Right

The cab pulls out of the intersection

INT CAB
Rath studies Bain There is a thin line of blood down his
temple Bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his

Gameboy resuming his game of Tetris

RATH
Howd you cut yourself

Their voices are distorted through the small electric
amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal
money exchanger

Bain touches the blood on his forehead looking at it a
bit surprised

BAIN
Oh Working A little accident

He wipes it off as best he can

RATH
You a waiter You look like a
waiter
Bain is uninterested
BAIN

Bain looks up

BAIN

Bain allows himself a bemused smile

BAIN
Sizzle lean

The cab passes the intersection for the airport
Bain sits up

BAIN

RATH

BAIN
That was Peterson back there That
goes to the expressway for the

airport

RATH
Youre right Talking too much

BAIN

Rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park

BAIN

RATH

up Get out

BAIN
You cant --

RATH
The hell I cant Its my cab I
dont like you So get the hell

Bain cant figure out what is wrong when he sees the
dashboard and the missing ID

Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror

BAIN
Holy fucking shit

The cab rocks as both men move Instantly guns fill their
hands Bain ripping out a 357 lifted from one of the
dead cops Rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free
from his jacket

Bain throws open the door about to run but stops He
looks at Rath He wants him to run Anyone who moves
away from the bullet proof glass is dead
Both men are silent each holding the other in their gun
sights

Bain blinks sweat forming on his lip

BAIN
I get out you got me

Bain reaches over and closes the door He smiles knowing
it is the right move

BAIN
Now what

Rath calmly uncocks his gun

RATH
Were both going to the airport

Bain nods

RATH
Sit back Put your seatbelt on

BAIN
No fucking way

RATH
Okay dont

Bain thinks
RATH
If either of us fucks around the
other can blow the fuel line
He points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs

Bain sits back aiming his gun watching Rath

Rath eases back into the drivers seat also holding his
gun on the fuel line

He puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic
turning back towards Peterson

They sit in silence studying each other when they hit
the expressway Bain cant contain himself giddy on
adrenaline

BAIN
Jesus -- Im being driven to the
airport by Robert Rath

He laughs

BAIN
I cant believe this You rolled
some cabby for the radio then
waited for an airport fare

He laughs again

BAIN
Boy thats fucking genius Youre

sitting there bullshitting with me
Man no way I coulda done that

RATH

BAIN

He leans back This is a big moment for him

BAIN
Bain Michael Bain

RATH

BAIN
Two years Two long fucking years

Something occurs to him and he leans close to the window

BAIN
Hey What I dont get was why
didnt you take the shot inside the
restaurant I mean you had me a
free shot Thats what I would have
done

RATH
Its just a shoot-out then Sixty-
forty at best Not my odds

BAIN
Sounds like chickenshit --

He laughs hard
BAIN
Listen to me calling you

chickenshit

He stops laughing and looks closely at the back of Raths
head

BAIN
Is that a wig Shit I hate wigs
Wigs are the worst part of this job
Id rather dye my hair than wear a
wig

Rath studies him

RATH
Youre wearing a wig now

Bain chokes on his laugh

BAIN
God damn are you good Everyone
says youre so fucking good I just
cant believe Im still alive If I
believed in God Id be down on my
knees Right now -- Hey how come

came through the door

Rath does not answer Bain smiles He knows something
about Rath now he doesnt like killing innocent people

BAIN
Shit if I was you back there --

He holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind Raths
head

BAIN
Game over

He laughs

BAIN
Do you mind if I ask you a couple of
business questions You know I was
wondering how much you bid this job
at

Rath says nothing

BAIN
You dont have to tell me that
Its just I know my bid was low
but was it too low I mean did I
seem like an amateur like I didnt
know what I was doing

RATH
We both know what you were doing

Bain moves close to the glass again checking out Raths
gun

BAIN
Smith and Wesson 22 with an eight
inch silencer Classic When I
first heard you used that I
thought shit thats a ladys gun
Now its all I use Clean real
clean

He looks at the gun still trained at the floor

BAIN
Would you really blow us

Rath does not have to answer

BAIN
Oh I got a question Jesus this
has been driving me crazy for years
-- shit listen to me I sound like
some fucking fanboy Im sorry but
I just got to ask you Everybody
talks about how you left the Agency
and got into the business and then
how you went after the Russian
Nicholai Talinkov --

RATH
Tachlinkov

BAIN

Yeah thats it And hes like a
fucking genius They said he shaded
you over and over And in the end
he aced you again Shaded and
faded They say hes living on some
Greek island but I say thats
fucking bullshit I say youre the
best and that you planted his ass
Am I right

Rath says nothing

BAIN
I bet Im right

The car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the
Cleveland airport

BAIN
Robert Bain driving me Jesus

RATH
After those cops youll never be
able to come back to Cleveland

BAIN
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland
Cleveland blows What kind of marks
have they got here Greasy mobster
teamster or some hand job
politician I want the money marks
I want the marks that you get

A long beat of silence

The CAB RUMBLES up onto the departures ramp which
circles past all of the terminals

BAIN
So what happens now

RATH
We go around once

BAIN
Bullshit

He throws off his seatbelt

BAIN

You tell me that were gonna go
around once then while Im
checking out the lay of the land
you bail out and send me flying over
the bridge Right Am I right

Rath doesnt answer studying the terminals noting the
police and airport security

Rath studies the terrain Bain studies Rath

Soon they have passed the entire airport Rath nods
Steering the car through traffic in onto a circle
interchange that will bring them to the beginning

Bain wipes the sweat from his face

RATH

BAIN
What Whats okay

Rath begins to accelerate rounding the interchange

BAIN
What are you doing

RATH

Theres a sand barricade up ahead
Im going to ram this cab into it
The cab has an airbag odds are good
Ill survive But with this steel
casing and bullet proof glass odds

for you are not so good
Bain laughs

BAIN
Oh man thats sweet Thats
fucking sweet

The speedometer continues to climb

BAIN
Youre bluffing

Rath says nothing Ahead at the ramp to the terminals
is the sand barricade

BAIN
Youre fucking with me You want me
to jump I jump you hit the brakes
and bang -- Game over

The cab is flying at its target

BAIN
No no Wait You dont want me to
jump Youre going to jump Im
stuck back here until its too late
Wham -- over

RATH
I know youre going to jump

Bain looks at him and then at the barricade

RATH
Youre still young Young enough to
still think youre indestructible
Invincible You believe with utter
certainty you can bail out at the
last second and survive

The barricade hurtles toward them rising up filling the
windshield

RATH
If you do survive well see each
other again

Bain screams throwing open the door and hurling himself
out

Rath jams on the brakes TIRES SCREAMING steering into
the steel side rail banking the car into the drums of
sand as --

Bain hits the pavement bouncing like a stone skipped
across water
A driver hits his brakes swerving just missing him

SAND EXPLODES from the impact and the cab bounces up over
the median into the bus-only lanes as the drivers airbag
balloons out of the steering wheel

Bain rolls and rolls finally stopping sprawled out like a
piece of roadkill

The cab careens up onto a curb slamming into a pole the
radiator spitting out a cloud of WHISTLING STEAM

Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain one car
stopping inches from him A woman jumps out rushing to
the front of the car but Bain is gone

Police CARS ROAR up into the midst of the accident One
of them pulling alongside the demolished cab The door is
open the airbag popped Rath is gone

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco

INT ELECTRAS APARTMENT - DAY

The apartment is always dark heavy drapes cover the
windows

The dining and living rooms look like the control booth of
a network television show stacks of video monitors and
consoles cables electric wiring coils of fiber optic
cord duct-taped to the floors walls and ceilings They
snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang
everywhere like some technological jungle

At the center of this tangled web is ELECTRA a beautiful
athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a
worn robe She is curled up in an overstuffed chair a
bowl of popcorn in her lap

On the monitors she is watching what at first might be
mistaken for a soap opera a young couple are having an
argument

What is strange is that the angle never changes a fish-
eye lens staring down into the room

MAN (VO)
I dont give a shit what your mother
thinks Im not sleeping with your
mother Im sleeping with you

WOMAN (VO)
You wont be for long with that
attitude

MAN (VO)
Jesus Jennifer if youre so god
damned worried about your mothers
approval why dont you move back
home so she can pat you on the head
when you do something right

ELECTRA
Jerk

Jennifer is too stunned to say anything There is a long
pause that is not at all like television It seems very
real

She starts to say something but stops trying to keep
herself from crying

MAN (VO)
Oh good Go ahead and cry

JENNIFER (WOMAN) (VO)
Would you please leave

Electra lifts her head smelling the air

ELECTRA
Mmm smell that Nikita

Nikita Electras black cat is stretched lazily across
the top of a chair her tail twitching absently Every

corner of the chair has been clawed open

Electra reaches for the control board and throws a series
of switches

The monitors flicker as the image changes We are now
looking down into a kitchen A stove is beneath us
almost like a cooking show where a round woman is taking
out a tray of chocolate chip cookies

Electra smells them again smiling as she inhales

ELECTRA
I hope she saves some for us

There is a BANG a DOOR SLAMMING in another apartment and
a MAN YELLING

Electra switches back to Jennifers apartment
The man is still in the living room but Jennifer is gone

MAN (VO)
Do you think slamming doors is going
to help work this out
Electra punches a command into a keyboard Several of the
screens change showing different rooms of the same
apartment Jennifer is in the bedroom lying on the bed
sobbing her face buried in a pillow

MAN (VO)
I can slam doors too

We hear the front DOOR SLAM in the hall outside of
Electras apartment and through the monitor speakers His
stomping FOOTSTEPS FADE as he storms down the hall and
staircase out of the building

Electra switches all of the screens to Jennifer

She watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom
Electra reaches out her fingers lightly touch the monitor
screen

INT APARTMENT HALL

Electras front door opens slowly Timidly she steps out
of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is

standing in front of Jennifers door

She starts to knock but stops herself She isnt sure
she should do this

She paces then turns to the door
She knocks so softly its almost impossible to hear

She stands trying to force herself to knock again when
she hears Jennifer

JENNIFER (0S)
Hello Ken is that you

Electra panics

The door knob turns the door opens and JENNIFER looks out
into the hall It is empty

INT ELECTRAS APARTMENT

On the monitors Electra watches Jennifer pick up the
phone

JENNIFER (VO)

Electras PAGER suddenly SOUNDS She shuts down the
screens and pulls out the pager checking the number

ELECTRA

all of the same components though the equipment is

bigger more powerful and less portable

On a table there is a bank of phones several cellular

Electra comes down the stairs

Outside the large glass door she sees KEN Jennifers

On the lobby floor is a letter apparently slipped under
the door addressed to Jennifer Morgan

Electra looks out the front door window making sure that
Ken is gone

She picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket

INT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

He is staring at it like it is a living thing a person
that he despises the blank screen reflecting his own

He waits

EXT SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY
There is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches
down heat rising off the tarmac
INT SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

Several passengers walk through the gate into the
terminal

Across from the gate Rath sits in a grungy airport
cafeteria reading a folded paper

He is wearing an airport security uniform a gun holstered
to his side

Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph
of a Japanese man wanted for industrial espionage

At the gate five Japanese men emerge Leading the group
is the man in Raths photo The other four are obviously

muscle

Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall
When they are almost out of sight he folds his newspaper
and begins to follow

His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator His
focus shifts continually from face to face expecting to
find Bains

His hand hovers near his gun

Ahead of him a thin young man wearing a long blue trench
coat stops Rath cannot see his face

The man starts toward a drinking fountain

Rath catches a glimpse of his face It could be Bain but
he isnt sure

The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of
water He rises into the barrel of Raths 22

A mouthful of water coughs from his mouth
It is not Bain and in the next instant the gun is gone

RATH
Sorry My mistake

Rath continues They young man is unable to move

EXT SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

The five men stride through the automated terminal doors
and towards a waiting limousine

Further down Rath now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans
exits and hails a cab

Hi Up ahead my boss is in that
black limo Were not sure which
hotel were at so could you just

follow them

Rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as
the cab pulls away

The five men sit in silence Strangely a PHONE begins to
RING

The older man whose name is AKIRA opens his briefcase
removing a cellular phone

AKIRA

I trust your flight was comfortable

AKIRA

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Electra is pacing talking into the cellular phone

ELECTRA
Ill call you again in twenty
minutes

a

e punches a button and shoves the antennae down

The hotel room looks like her apartment There is a
computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the
wood laminate desk Cables whip and wind across the
carpeted floor to the central air duct

The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray
coaxial run up inside the duct

Immediately Electra is busy finishing her preparations
She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on-
line

On the monitor screen we see an empty hotel room that
looks exactly like the one she is in
INT CAB

Rath stares out the window watching the surrounding
traffic the limo still in sight

Something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded
newspaper where he had hid the contract file

He flips past several documents before finding what hes
looking for the cat
He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it

INT HOTEL ROOM

Laying on the bed in a patch of sunlight Nikita watches
Electra rush about

Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks
it out

ELECTRA
Excuse me your Highness

Nikita casually walks off the bed

Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a
long piece of duct-tape

elevator The doors close

Across the lobby Rath enters walking past the elevators

As the elevator rises we begin to hear a SOUND a
familiar sound

Cramped in the corner is Bain He is PLAYING TETRIS

wearing dark sunglasses and a WALKMAN PUMPING SPEED METAL
into his ears

INT HOTEL ROOM

Electra continues to pace checking the monitors

INT ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN

At the switchboard a YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE wearing an
operators headset takes a late breakfast order typing
the order in the hotel computer

YOUNG MAN (YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE)

thirty minutes Youre welcome

He turns around and Rath is right behind him

INT ELEVATOR

The fourteenth floor the BELL CHIMES the doors slide
open and the clump of Japanese men get out

Just as the doors begin to close Bain steps out

INT HALL

Bain follows them down the hall still PLAYING the GAME
There is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on
its prey

As Akira finds 1414 and opens the door another door burst
open a large family heading for the pool

The moment is gone the Japanese men close the door and
Bain continues down the hall again PLAYING the GAME

INT HOTEL SUITE

When the Japanese men enter the suite we realize that
this is the image on Electras monitors Surveillance
camcorders and microphones are mounted in various
locations to display every inch of the room The group
hesitates for a moment under the electronic eyes
The four goons have their hands in their jackets

A small LAPTOP COMPUTER sits on the coffee table HUMMING
SOFTLY It is the only noise in the room until a speaker
crackles

ELECTRASPEAKER (V0O)
Good morning gentlemen I
apologize for the arrangement but
we all know those arent business
cards youre reaching for If
anyone leaves this room the deals
off

The operator is unconscious slumped in the corner

Rath studies the hotel computer screen intently the
information rolling by

We see that it is the previous nights room service
receipts

tuna fish Room 1014

as she speaks into the microphone

On the monitor we see Akira at the coffee table shove the
first disk into the laptop disk drive

Akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a
goon who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar

bills down the central air duct

The little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies

INT HYATT HALL

Bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of
TETRIS
Suddenly he stops

BAIN
Yes

The display of the game reads Game Over and
congratulates Bain on a new high score

Bain stands smiling He puts the game in his pocket and
starts down the hall

INT HOTEL ROOM

Electra is crouched at the open duct grabbing another
stack of money stuffing it into her bag

A LOUD BANG EXPLODES out of the SPEAKERS and she looks up
at the monitor
INT HOTEL SUITE

The lock on the door has been broken and standing in the
frame is Bain

BAIN
Surprise

He raises his arm his GUN spitting SILENT BULLETS

INT HOTEL ROOM

Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the
nearest bodyguard FIRING a SHOT into his belly

ELECTRA
Oh God

INT HOTEL SUITE

Another SHOT and the second bodyguard falls The other
two draw their handguns and Bain shields himself with the
lifeless body of his first victim

They FIRE at Bain but are unable to hit him

Bain squeezes off TWO MORE SHOTS and the two men fall
dead He lets his human shield fall to the ground and
levels his gun on the shaking Akira

AKIRA
Dont kill me

Bain looks at him and smiles then FIRES

Electra leaps at the computer ripping the cord from the
modem

Bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it

He licks the lens leaving a smear of saliva
She stuffs the disks into her bag She puts Nikita in her
travel kitty and charges for the door grabbing her
coat
Flinging it over her shoulder she does not notice the

letter from Ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from
the room

Electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes
She is staring down the barrel of Raths 22

Behind him in the bathroom mirror we see one of the
Japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet He is
naked

station

You want me to pump

RATH
No stay in the car I want you to
understand something If I intended
to kill you you would already be
dead

Electra says nothing
He reaches over and takes the car keys

When he is out of the car Electra slowly releases the
strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel
ELECTRA
Okay Nikita stay calm think
breathe think

Electra checks the rear view mirror listening as Rath
pumps the gas Her eyes flash down to her bag

Outside Rath watches Electra through the windows She
appears motionless

The electric gas counter races like a stop watch
In the car Electra eases her hand into her bag

The tank full Rath re-hangs the pump He walks around
the car and heads for the station

Electra waits until his back is turned She pulls her
tool pouch from her bag throws it open and finds her wire
stripper Reaching under the dash she yanks out a
tangled handful of wire

She looks up Rath is inside paying

ELECTRA
Come on come on its a cake walk

Her fingers fly with surgical precision snipping
stripping twisting

Rath steps out of the station as her head pops up looking
for him It takes only a second for him to realize what
she is doing

Oh shit

He runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and
strikes them the BATTERY GRINDS

Please please

He is almost there when the ENGINE FIRES She stomps on

into it He bounces backward falling to the ground

By the time Electra reaches the top floor Jennifer is
entering her apartment

Electra hurries past Jennifers door to her own

Electra flies across the living room to the monitors
She clicks them on putting on Jennifers channel

On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking
her phone messages One from her mother

Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifers entire
apartment is in front of her

On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the
oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room

Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath
Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out
Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just

been

Wearing rubber surgeons gloves he picks up the mail that
she had dropped on the table and sorts through it

Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference
to Jennifers presence as if he were invisible as though
he knew she couldnt see him

He moves into a room just as she moves out

Electra watches dizzy sick with terror but she is
unable to turn away

Bain searches through a desk drawer while Jennifer starts
undressing for her bath

He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom
If Jennifer would turn around she would see him
Electra is about to run to call out when --
Something catches Bains eye

He moves into the bedroom and is turned so that he is
looking straight up into the camera

He inches towards it not sure what it is The fiber
optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over
the bed

Staring at it he is looking right at Electra

Bain steps up onto the bed his face distorting as he
moves close to the fish-eye lens Poking it with his
finger he realizes what it is A warped smile stretches

across his face as he whispers --

Oh you sick little bitch --

Electra tears away from the screen panic seizing hold of
her

She rips entire drawers out of her dresser dumping them
into a suitcase stuffing in anything that looks
important She grabs Nikita in the travel kitty

EXT LARGE CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT

Somewhere in the city

INT HOTEL ROOM

Electra and Rath enter the room together but they are both
immediately alone

She walks across the room to a chair in the corner
curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into her
lap

He sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of
the room and sits

They watch each other Silence

Between then is the liquor cabinet Rath knows a good
idea when he sees one

RATH
Want a drink

Her face is as expressionless as Nikitas
He pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down
Takes a deep breath then pours himself another one

RATH
Okay

He returns to his table with his drink

RATH
Im not good at this sort of thing
but we dont have a lot of time so
Ill just go ahead and get started
First you I ask myself ‘What is
she thinking

Her body tightens coils

RATH
Simple Shes scared Shes almost
been killed twice and now she is
alone in a room with a man that she
believes is an assassin

Another deep pull on the bourbon

RATH
Furthermore she was brought here not
entirely on her own accord which
only increases her fear and
suspicion Thus as long as she is
afraid her first maybe her only
thought will be escape Does that
leave me any other option

He slugs down the rest of his drink and stands whipping
out his gun

RATH
No

Crossing the room he turns the gun around and offers it
to her She looks at it Back at him

He puts it on the bed beside her turns his back and walks
to the bar

She picks up the gun
RATH
The gun is silenced She could
shoot me right now

She stands Nikita jumping from her lap

RATH
She could take the car and be far
from here before the maid comes in
the morning but --

She starts squeezing OFF ROUNDS the LAMP EXPLODES the
CHAIRS around him ERUPT tufts of white stuffing leaping
into the air

ELECTRA
Shut up

He freezes bottle in one hand glass in the other

ELECTRA
Stop trying to tell me what Im
thinking

She moves closer to him the gun squeezed in her fist

ELECTRA
Ill tell you what youre thinking
-- you think Im not going to shoot
you but right now youre not so
sure are you

A slight shake of the head no

ELECTRA
Youre thinking that maybe it was a
mistake to give me this gun that
maybe Im not going to think about
things logically because Im a woman
and Im freaked out and Im going to
do something impulsive and
irrational -- right

She FIRES the GUN to both sides of his head Hes
surprised to be alive

ELECTRA
You dont know shit about me Now
sit down

He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression
she had worn sitting a moment ago

She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles
of liquor She sucks it all down and throws the bottle
across the room

Grabbing another she sits on the edge of the bed

ELECTRA
Okay How did you find me

RATH
Youre the computer hacker you tell
me
ELECTRA
You didnt know anything about me

Nikita rubs up against her leg

ELECTRA
Nikita

RATH
Yellow Pages V for veterinarian
There arent that many

She nods slurping at her bottle

ELECTRA
Youre one of them arent you

RATH
Them

ELECTRA
An assassin

RATH

Until a minute ago

ELECTRA
What does that mean

RATH
If I still was what I used to be
you would not be pointing that at
me

Electra eyes him considers shooting him right now

ELECTRA
Who is that other guy

RATH
Another contractor

ELECTRA
Someone hired both of you

RATH
No They hired Bain The contract
would have been mine but Bain took
it from me as he took the previous

one
ELECTRA

So this is something between you and

him

RATH
She FIRES

He stole the contract knowing that
I would come after him

ELECTRA
Why

RATH
Because he is trying to retire me

ELECTRA
He wants to kill you

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA
Why

RATH

The nature of the business You
remove your competition

ELECTRA
And you want to use me to get him

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA
Forget it

RATH

We dont have a choice
the GUN pocking the wall behind him

ELECTRA
Dont tell me I dont have a choice

RATH
Right

ELECTRA
Im two seconds away from making my
choice which means youve got two
seconds to tell me why I shouldnt
shoot you

RATH
Its simple You need me I need
you And we will both need money

ELECTRA
I dont need you to get the money --
my money

RATH
Shes up pacing

If it hadnt been for me you would
be dead

ELECTRA
I dont need the money

RATH
This is something that is never
going to end You can never work in
the business again with this
contract because he will find you
To survive you have to go into deep
hiding And thats going to take
money a lot of money

ELECTRA
Then you can have the disks and Ill
just walk out that door --

RATH
If you walk out that door Bain will
still come after you

ELECTRA
Why

RATH
Because he took a contract on you
Hell come for you and hell find
you

ELECTRA
You dont know that -- youre trying
to scare me

RATH

No Its the truth I know what
you are Like me like Bain youre
a ghost youre not part of the real
world You dont have a social
security number You dont pay
taxes Youve probably used ten
different names over the last ten
years A long time ago something
probably happened something illegal
and you ran you disappeared and it
was easy You think you can do it
again But Im telling you fading
from the law is nothing No matter
what you do where you go I swear
to you that Bain will find you

ELECTRA
How

knowing there is some truth in that
RATH
Right now as we sit here he is
tearing through your apartment He
is digging through your drawers
emptying your closets He will take
your telephone and address books
your appointment books If you keep
a diary he is reading it Hell go
into the kitchen and find out what
kind of food you eat liquor you
drink cigarettes you smoke In the
bathroom he will find any
prescription drugs you take and
where you get them filled If you
have video tape or recordings he
will watch and listen to all of
them

She is coming unglued Imagining him watching her tapes
going through her possessions She is moving pacing
ready to explode

ELECTRA
Oh Jesus Jesus

RATH
He will know everything about you
Everything I know because Ive
done it Once youve been inside a
marks home youre in their head
If youre any good youll find the
mark in a week and Bain is good
because I was the best and I
couldnt take him

She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN firing it
everywhere fear and anger rocketing out of her in
WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD

When she stops he starts to say something but she levels
the gun at him

ELECTRA
Shut up All right Youve said
enough

She forces herself back grabbing handfuls of the sample
bottles

ELECTRA
I need to think To be alone

With the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following
at her feet she goes into the bathroom and slams the
door
INT BATHROOM
She locks the door and then collapses Her body seems to
fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall the GUN

and the BOTTLES falling from her arms CLATTERING SOFTLY
on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands

INT BEDROOM
Very mechanically Rath begins setting up his chess board
putting the pieces into the same positions It isa
ritual and with it he enters a kind of trance
From the bathroom almost inaudible he hears Electra
CRYING
INT BATHROOM
With her head now buried in her arms and knees she is
sobbing her body rocking The crying seems very similar
to Jennifers a complete emotional release
INT BEDROOM
Rath stares at the board The CRYING grows LOUDER He
stands and walks to the door He starts to knock but
stops himself
Like Electra with Jennifer Rath would like to help he
just has no idea how to He turns back to the desk to
his chess game
INT BATHROOM
Her eyes are now burning red She stops crying long
enough to suck down an entire sample of Scotch Nikita
rubs against her and she strokes her
ELECTRA

Oh shit Nikita
INT BEDROOM
Rath is setting up his computer system He hears the TUB
FILLING UP
INT BATHROOM

Nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking

ELECTRA
Cheers

Electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor
where we see that many of the bottles are now empty

In the tub steam rising off the surface she wrings out a
wash cloth and covers her face sinking deeper into the
water

INT BEDROOM

When Electra comes out of the bathroom Rath is again at
his chess game She sits down across from him and sets

the gun on the table between them

Rath looks up at her

ELECTRA
Listen -- I dont even know your
name

RATH

Rath Robert Rath

ELECTRA
Electra

RATH
Just Electra

ELECTRA
Yeah

RATH

As in daughter of Agamemnon

ELECTRA
No Just Electra

The conversation dies

ELECTRA
What Im trying to say is that --
Im not sure I can do this help
you unless I know more about you

RATH
What do you want to know

ELECTRA
If Bain hadnt taken the contract on
me would you have

He stares at her

RATH
No

ELECTRA
Why

RATH
Because Im done

ELECTRA
This is crazy I cant trust you
You cant trust me How can we
possibly help each other

They sit in silence the gun and the chess game lying
between them

RATH
Do you play

She looks at the chess board

ELECTRA
With computers

RATH
Its not the same is it

ELECTRA
Better than playing with yourself

He smiles

RATH
I had an opponent

She understands that he is trying to tell her something

ELECTRA
Had

RATH
He was Russian Nicholai
Tachlinkov A legend in the
business when I was just starting
I admired him When I heard he
loved chess I became obsessed with
the game

Electra studies the board

ELECTRA
He was white

Rath nods

ELECTRA
It looks like whites game
RATH
We played with a code using The New
York Times obituaries Over three
years we played twelve matches I
never won

ELECTRA
Why didnt you finish this game

She reaches over and lifts a White Knight and takes a
Bishop Rath counters taking her Knight

RATH
He was taken

ELECTRA
He was killed

Rath nods

Throughout the entire conversation they continue to play
out the chess game

ELECTRA

By who
A long beat

RATH
I killed him

ELECTRA
Why

RATH

Because thats how it works Thats
what its about He was the best
He was on top

ELECTRA
Where you wanted to be

RATH
Yes As soon as you get into this
business all you can think about is
getting to the top Thats all
there is Until then there is
nothing You are nothing

ELECTRA
How did you get into the business

RATH
The same way everyone does the
government the Agency
ELECTRA
The C1A

RATH
More or less

ELECTRA
How old were you

RATH
They recruited me when I was in high
school

ELECTRA
Jesus -- why

RATH
Languages I was already fluent in
nine languages

ELECTRA
You were like a boy genius

RATH
Some people said that I never
thought so

ELECTRA
Why not

RATH
I was just different

ELECTRA
You went from high school to the
Agency

RATH
No I graduated from George
Washington University Then I
entered the Agency training program

ELECTRA
They didnt give you a choice did
they

RATH
No they didnt

ELECTRA
But you knew what they were training
you for

RATH
Of course I was going to be James
Bond
ELECTRA
Ahhhh

RATH
They are very good at what they do
Its very seductive The training
the weapons the travel --

ELECTRA
The exotic women

RATH
Women No not really
ELECTRA
Why not
RATH
Women I dont I dont want to

talk about women

ELECTRA
Why

RATH
Because you are a women

ELECTRA
Why did you leave the Agency

RATH
The same reason everyone does You
hear your name on C-SPAN and you
realize youre a skeleton in
someones closet and theyre coming
to bury you

ELECTRA
They tried to kill you

RATH
Yes It didnt matter much to them
as long as I disappeared

ELECTRA
Then you went freelance

RATH
The only thing different about the
private sector is that a General
Contractor takes less of a
percentage than the government so
you make more money Then once you
make the transition you realize you
were never working for the
government it was always the
private sector the vested interests
and its the same vested interests
that continue to buy your plane
tickets

ELECTRA
Tell me about the first time

RATH
My first take

ELECTRA
Yes

RATH
Why

ELECTRA

Because I want to know

RATH
It was mechanical Very precise
It was exactly like the training
drill except for the adrenaline

ELECTRA
Are they usually like that

RATH
No Just the first one

ELECTRA

After that
RATH

They become complicated messy
ELECTRA

Did it ever bother you

RATH
Did it ever bother James Bond

ELECTRA
Thats fiction

RATH
This is fiction Dont you see
that This is another reality And
the people that come into the world
to play this game -- nobody forces
them Theyre here they know the
rules the stakes the risks Do
you understand what I am saying No
one is innocent -- including you

ELECTRA
Does that mean it didnt bother you
Rath leans back and stares at her She waits

RATH
You get a job swinging a hammer the
first day you get a blister it
tears open it bleeds and it stays
sore a long time You keep swinging
the hammer you get a good hard
callous that covers that spot and it
never bothers you again

Electra says nothing He leans forward and slides a rook
into her back row

RATH
Check
He leans bac
RATH
Is that what you wanted to hear
Something cold blooded something
remorseless
ELECTRA

No Something honest
A beat Rath likes this woman

She moves her Queen

ELECTRA
Mate
He smiles
ELECTRA
I hope your plan is better than your
game

INT CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT

The room is ugly Shag carpeting wood paneling and
polyester patterned curtains

We hear a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKING away as we MOVE
ACROSS a table The hotel phone is in a modem which is
held together with duct tape Between the modem and the
computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of
naked circuit boards

It is a very similar set up to Raths only it has been
put together with a fraction of the resources

Bain sits typing at the computer his shirt off Beside
the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer

Doritos and his Gameboy

On
is

Bain finishes punching in a code

a bag of

the floor disassembled neatly on a small white towel

his cleaned gun

sits back and sucks down

his beer
CONTRACTOR SCREEN

He is communicating with his General Contractor
On the table is a collection of personal objects much of
it stuffed in pillow cases taken from Electras house

Bain fingers a pair of satin panties

Bain stares at the screen thinking Thinking hard

INT LARGE CHAIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Another computer screen but we dont know that it is

ELECTRA
Three days

INT AIRPLANE - DAY

Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section
which she is obviously enjoying smiling and sipping
champagne

ELECTRA
God I love first class I remember
when I was a little girl I would
wonder what it was like up here I
would always try to peek through the
curtains

Rath says nothing staring out the window
Electra shakes her head

ELECTRA
I hope Nikitas all right
He still does not respond

ELECTRA
Hey where are you

RATH
Thinking

ELECTRA
About

RATH
Nothing

Electra sips the last of her champagne
ELECTRA

RATH
Yes
EXT SMALL MEXICAN AIRPORT - DAY

The plane lands

EXT TERMINAL CAB STAND

Rath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them
in his trunk

INT CAB
Rath speaks perfect Spanish

RATH
(in Spanish)
Good afternoon We have
reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in
Costa Blanca

CABBY
(in Spanish)
Yes sir
EXT HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

The cab pulls up in front of a large brand new glass
hotel which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the
gulf water

Rath is upset

RATH
(in Spanis
No no I said the Hotel Paraiso

CABBY
(in Spanis
Yes This is the Hotel Paraiso

RATH
(in Spanis
No the other Hotel Paraiso in the
city Near the Plaza del Sol

CABBY
(in Spanis
Im sorry sir A year ago there
was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso
This is the new Hotel Paraiso

RATH
(in Spanish)
Take us there

EXT COSTA BLANCA - DAY

American tourist dollars have built up the coasts but
much of the out-lying city is very poor

The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk The
face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang
in space as something non-corporeal like the shadow of
the building rather than the building itself

Rath stares at it remembering

Electra is behind him standing in the midst of the Plaza
del Sol

He looks up to the fifth story window then turns directly
opposite of that

The International Banco de Mexico an enormous beautiful
old building its exterior walls are white-washed

concrete blindingly bright white

Electra looks at the bank and smiles
ELECTRA
So thats where all that S and L
money is

Rath is not listening to her He is somewhere else He
turns back to the fourth story window

RATH
Thats where hell be

ELECTRA
What

RATH
I wasnt expecting this I need to
think

EXT HOTEL PARAISO - NIGHT

Beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to
midnight oil

INT HOTEL PARAISO ELEVATOR

On one side of the elevator is a young couple who look
like newlyweds They are cuddling kissing and giggling

as though they are alone

Electra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator
It is a strange contrast

Electra is staring at them

Rath behind his sunglasses is in his own world
The ELEVATOR CHIMES and opens

Nobody moves

The DOORS CHIME again and start to close as everyone
realizes that this is their floor

Rath and the other man grab the doors which spring back
open

It is a funny awkward moment as everyone apologizes and
smiles politely on the way out
INT HALL

The couple move down the hall the newlyweds finding their
door first
Rath reaches the door to their room opens it and enters
Electra lingers watching the other couple watching as he
fumbles for his keys her hand running up between his legs

and over his ass

He finally manages to open the door and she pushes him
inside

Electra softly closes her door

INT HOTEL PARAISO - HOTEL ROOM

Rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding
balcony doors at the dark gulf water

ELECTRA
Did you see them

Electra moves about the large suite

ELECTRA
They looked like they were in love

Rath says nothing

ELECTRA
Well I think Ill take a bath
Come on Nikita

The two of them walk into the bathroom leaving Rath to
himself

INT BATHROOM

Electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub water
running through her fingers as she adjusts the
temperature

After a beat she hears a SMALL CRASH a GLASS BREAKING

It is followed by other MUFFLED NOISES a WOMAN GIGGLING
and a THUMPING The sounds are coming from the other side
of the tub wall from the other suite Electra puts her
ear against the tile to listen

The WATER FILLING her TUB is too loud for her to hear
She turns it OFF

There is more BUMPING and THUMPING the WOMAN LAUGHING and
then the LAUGHS SHORTEN into SOFT WHIMPERS

fea

lectra hangs on each sound slowly lifted by it moving
up toward the over-head fan and ducts

The SOUNDS get LOUDER as she moves closer to the vents
until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub
listening to what is clearly the sounds of TWO PEOPLE
MAKING LOVE

Their MOANS and SHRIEKS CLIMAX and Electra smiles

INT BEDROOM

It is dark now A single desk light is on under which
Rath is setting up his chess board putting the pieces in
their familiar pattern

Electra comes out of the bathroom She seems very clean
and fresh wearing a long white T-shirt and thin robe

ELECTRA
That felt great You should try it

She watches him setting the pieces onto the board
ELECTRA
Dont you ever get tired of playing

the same game

He looks at her

RATH
No

ELECTRA
Why not

RATH

It helps me to focus It centers
me helps me think

ELECTRA
Oh What do you think about

RATH
Work The things I need to get
done

She sits across from him looking at the board

ELECTRA
Do you think about the game

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA
But youve never figured out a way
to win

RATH
No

ELECTRA

Not even a stalemate

No

What happens if you do

RATH

ELECTRA

This strikes Rath as a very strange question and he is

suddenly annoyed by her

Can I ask you something

ELECTRA

He knows she will anyway

He finishes his glass of bourbon

She is not sure what to say next

ELECTRA

What will you do if this works if
we get the money

I dont know

RATH

» Maybe Ill live ona
boat sail to all the places Ive

ELECTRA

He pours himself another drink dropping in some ice

ELECTRA

RATH

She pulls the covers tightly to her chin Her eyes do not
close

INT HOTEL (COSTA BLANCA) - NIGHT

A small hotel in the city away from the beaches built
before there was such a thing as central air conditioning

Bain is naked except for a small pair of camouflage
jockeys and his Walkman strapped to his shoulder His
head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in
his ears

He is tearing open a long box wrapped in Happy Birthday
paper

Inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle
He smiles

He assembles it quickly snapping it together with
automatic ease When the sight is tightened in place he
jumps up

In the mirror over the dresser he poses down with the
gun

Not satisfied he grabs his shades and checks himself
again He starts moving with the music playing with the
gun first as a guitar then whipping it around spinning
it expertly like a drum and bugle corpsman The gun zips
and flashes around as he whirls in place then freezes

The butt of the rifle to his shoulder he peers down the
scope at his own head reflected in the mirror He is
sweating and breathing but the barrel does not move
BAIN
Youre dead motherfucker

EXT HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

Electra leans out over the railing smiling inhaling the
warm air the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea

Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame

RATH
Breakfast

ELECTRA
Why dont you bring it out here
Its beautiful out here

Rath steps a little farther out He looks down either
side of the building checking sight lines He looks out
and sees another hotel with windows facing them

He turns to her Says nothing Moves back inside

INT HOTEL ROOM

The breakfast trays are empty Rath is sipping coffee
scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper

Electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach
He stops working

ELECTRA
I know what you are thinking Im
not going to disappear okay Im
not going anywhere just down there
to that beautiful beach I got to
get out of this room just for a
little while

RATH
Okay

ELECTRA
Really

RATH

He wont be looking for you Just
be careful Buy a book Keep your
sunglasses on

ELECTRA
Book Sunglasses Great
INT HOTEL HALL

Electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach
At the end of the hall she sees the newlywed couple get
on the elevator She starts to call to them to hold it
for her but she stops herself

The elevator closes

She edges slowly down the hall stopping outside the door
to their suite She touches it with the tips of her
fingers

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Rath is still at the table

The curtain begins to billow a soft breeze blowing
through the open patio door They swell open and fall
It seems for a moment that there is a figure a shadow in

the changing shape of the curtain

Rath stands He walks to the open door Standing in the
frame he looks out at the blue ocean below

He slides the door closed and the curtains fall still

EXT PLAZA DEL SOL - DAY

Bain moves through the market booths lining the edges of
the plaza His eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses

He buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the
plaza

He looks at the bank at the military-style security
guards that patrol the front

He turns in the plaza checking the perimeter his gaze
falling on the tall burned-out building

He looks back at the bank imagining the sight line

He bites into the apricot its juice gushing running down
his chin

INT HOTEL ROOM

Rath is leaning back in the bed NIKITA PURRING in his
lap

He did not sleep last night and is very tired His eyes
fight to stay open
The sound of the TELEVISION momentarily hangs in the hotel
room as he sleeps The program is a SPANISH DUBBED
version of GOLDFINGER

The door bangs open and Rath springs off the bed a gun
flashing in his hand leveling it at a dazed blinking
Electra

Rath sighs slowly letting the hammer of the GUN CLICK
back into place

RATH
You should knock

ELECTRA
Sorry

RATH
How was the beach

ELECTRA
The beach It was nice

She smiles

EXT HOTEL PARAISO - DUSK

The sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows
of the hotel

INT HOTEL ROOM

Electra is sitting on the bed her back against the wall
In her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is
looking over the top of staring intensely across the
room

We can hear Rath his breathing deep and even He is
doing Tai Chi wearing only his boxer shorts His body is
coated in a sheen of sweat his muscles strained as he
moves fluidly through space

Electra begins to breath with him

She moves her body slightly her hips rising as though to
meet his

He empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops his
eyes closed rested

ELECTRA
That was beautiful

He looks at her
ELECTRA
Tai Chi right

He nods

ELECTRA
Where did you learn it

RATH
Taiwan

ELECTRA
Not that I would know but you look
like youre really good at it

RATH
Thank you

ELECTRA
Ive always wanted to learn
something like that

RATH
You should Its very important
that the body release the energy
that builds in it

Electra nods watching him bend reaching for a change of
clothes

RATH
Im going to shower If youre
hungry go ahead and order some

dinner

Electra nods again

INT COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT

Bain is doing push ups He is naked except for his
camouflage bikinis

He has his feet up on a chair making it harder the dip
deeper

His body is gushing sweat his face a burning red

He is like a piston firing up and down The muscles in
his neck and shoulders are bulging cords

Slowly his arm begin to tire the strain seen in his
knotting and twisting expression

Half way up he collapses feet falling off the chair

He rolls onto his back rubbing a tricep It hurts He
licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles

INT HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

Rath checks his watch Its after eight oclock He
lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem

RATH

Electra drops her book and climbs off the bed
He dials types the code and waits

He opens a case and pulls out his gun some paper and pens
and two small mikes that look like hearing aids

RATH
Okay --

He starts drawing several squares on the paper as Electra
picks up the mike She looks over it frowns

ELECTRA
Two way
RATH
Transmits and receives

ELECTRA
Cheap as shit

He looks at her

RATH
I paid a lot for these

ELECTRA
They saw you coming a mile away If
I had known wed be using --

RATH
Its too late now Okay Well have
to deal with these

ELECTRA
Fine

He goes back to his drawing

RATH
This is the bank This is the
hotel In the morning I will enter
the bank

ELECTRA
Check

RATH
He will be hidden somewhere out
here probably somewhere low in the
crowd Hell stay there until he
sees me enter the bank

ELECTRA
But he wont shoot you right then

RATH
No It would be amateur A risk
Hell wait for the prime shot that
he knows is coming Once Im
inside hell move to the hotel
Hell go up the back too much
traffic in the front

He draws another square

RATH
Youll be here A restaurant A
public place far enough away that he
wont notice you but with a good
enough view youll be able to see
him when he moves inside
ELECTRA
Okay Then what

RATH
Then we wait

ELECTRA
Aiiee More waiting I dont know
if I like this plan

RATH
It will take the entire day but he
will begin to doubt himself He
will begin to believe that he missed
me that somehow I slipped by and am
already on a plane to Europe

He describes this as though remembering it

He shakes

RATH
The sun will be low almost dark
the air cool and the bank will
almost be closed 545 550 He
will put the rifle down he will get
up and he will walk across the plaza
to the bank

ELECTRA
Why wont he wait until the bank
closes

RATH
He wont be able to Hell have to
go inside Hell have to see with
his own eyes whether or not I am
there If the bank closes he wont
know for sure Hell come Im
sure And when he does youll go
into the hotel go upstairs and take
the gun

ELECTRA
What What if he brings it with
him

his head

RATH
He cant The bank has an expensive
security system metal detectors and
X-ray machines

ELECTRA
That means you wont have a gun

RATH
Thats right

ELECTRA
And with the mikes Ill tell you
when he leaves the hotel and youll
tell me when he leaves the bank

RATH
If things go well I dont have to
Youll already be in a rented car
waiting for me

ELECTRA
Youll have the money How do I
know that you wont --

RATH
Ill be walking out of the bank
unarmed Youll have the gun and
Ill drive the car

ELECTRA
We split the money

RATH
Five million apiece You get on
your plane I get on mine

ELECTRA
Sounds pretty well figured out

RATH
Ive been thinking about it for a
long time

ELECTRA
Except --
RATH

ELECTRA
Except if he doesnt come out of
the hotel
RATH

I told you he will

ELECTRA
You cant know for sure how can
you I mean youre not him

Rath nods

RATH
Ten years ago I sat there in that
same hotel window sweat pouring off
of me waiting --

ELECTRA
For Nicholai

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA

You killed him here In this city
outside that bank

ELECTRA
What is it I dont like this at
all What is going on here

RATH
I dont know It just happened I
was here ten years ago Im here
now Thats it

ELECTRA
I dont believe that

RATH
It wasnt planned or premeditated
I swear Things happened beyond my
control I understood I saw where
they were leading and I suppose that
it just made sense

ELECTRA
Ten years ago

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA

What happened

RATH
I waited until I was insane and then
I walked into the bank He was
sitting there very calm waiting
for me

ELECTRA
What did he want

RATH
He wanted what I want now to get
out of the business To disappear
to some empty Greek island

RATH
What did he say

RATH
He said I couldnt win That no one
wins at this game

ELECTRA
Was that it

RATH
Then he offered me one million
dollars to walk away to quit the
business

ELECTRA
You didnt take it

RATH
No I went back to the hotel And
waited

ELECTRA

Ten years later here you are again
RATH

Yes Here I am again
POV - THROUGH TELESCOPIC LENS - MARBLE STATUE
The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight are lined-up on the
head of a marble statue
INT COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT
Bain is laying on the floor in the dark The rifle is
under him as he aims out of his balcony down the street

at the statue

He looks up from the scope checking the street It is
dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight

His finger squeezes the GUN ALMOST SILENT as --
INTERCUT WITH

STATUE

A chunk of STONE EXPLODES out the head of the statue
Again the GUN SPITS and another cloud of dust and ROCK

BURSTS from the head His finger is pumping the trigger
until the head cracks and falls
Hes laughing hysterical looking down the street at the
headless statue

He rolls onto his side still laughing Then suddenly he
stops staring up at the stars in the night sky

INT HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

Electra is still at the table staring at the diagrams in
another world

Rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her

ELECTRA
This has been the longest day of my
life

Rath nods pouring himself a drink Electra looks at the
drink downs the whole glass He refills it

ELECTRA
Do you have ulcers

RATH
No

ELECTRA
I think I got one today

RATH
Five million dollars will buy a lot
of Rolaids

She smiles They both gulp down their drinks and he fills
them again

ELECTRA
What do you suppose hes doing now

Rath shrugs He is no longer looking at her staring at
the board moving his mind into the chess game

She watches him and then begins to study it with him the

way a child does almost imitating him She does not want
to be left alone right now

She reaches over and moves a white knight

He blinks His eyes shifting sorting the possibilities

He picks a bishop and counters

After another sequence he takes her bishop and she takes
his knight

RATH
Why did you trade a bishop for a
knight

ELECTRA
I hate bishops Theyre useless I
like knights

RATH
Theyre worth less points

ELECTRA
So

There is no point in arguing
As they continue to play we begin to hear in the

distance the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very
vigorous LOVE

Electra watches Rath to see if he hears them He shows no
sign of it concentrating on the game

ELECTRA
Do you hear them

He looks up

ELECTRA
Listen

He hears it Not interested

ELECTRA
Did you think they were newlyweds

RATH
I didnt notice them

ELECTRA
When I first saw them I thought they
were married

RATH
How do you know theyre not

ELECTRA
I went into their room this
afternoon

RATH
What

ELECTRA

It was no big deal I saw them
leave I went in

RATH
Jesus if someone had --

ELECTRA
Nobody ever sees me

RATH
Why in the hell would you take that
chance

ELECTRA

I heard them last night and it made
me want to know something about
them I wanted to so I did

Rath shakes his head In the bg the WOMAN is ALMOST
SCREAMING

ELECTRA
She is married but not to him
Another man much older She has
four kids The young guy works for
her And I think she likes kinky
sex

RATH
Thank you

ELECTRA
Isnt it interesting though I
mean look at us in this room Or
yesterday when we were walking in
the plaza market I mean we look
like just another couple But what
are we Doesnt it seem so crazy

RATH
No

ELECTRA
No

RATH

Its always been that way The
world has always functioned on two
levels

ELECTRA
I know It makes me crazy

RATH
Why

ELECTRA
I dont know When I was in
college I was forced to go toa
psychiatrist because I was caught
drilling holes in my dorm room
floor

RATH
And you were drilling these
holes

ELECTRA

So I could watch the girl that lived
under me

RATH
Apparently this doctor was unable to
cure you

ELECTRA

He told me that my curiosity became
unnaturally entangled with my sense
of self-preservation

RATH
Did he explain how this happened

ELECTRA

He believed it all went back to one
night when as a little girl I
watched my parents have this big
fight really big I thought my
mother was going to kill my father
Then they went into their room and
made up And I watched them make
love through the keyhole

The WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX
Electra moves her queen taking his other knight

RATH
What are you doing

ELECTRA
What

RATH
Thats a ridiculous move

ELECTRA

Why

RATH
Because Ill take it

ELECTRA
Im playing white remember You
cant tell me which pieces to move
It doesnt work that way

He shrugs and takes her queen the game continuing
ELECTRA
Can I ask you something

RATH
Im sure you will

ELECTRA
Am I attractive

This gets his attention

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA
Are you attracted to me

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA
Why

RATH

Why I dont know

ELECTRA
Is it a physical thing or a mental
thing

RATH
Both

A good answer Electra smiles

ELECTRA
Is that why you didnt want to talk
about women before

RATH
I didnt want to complicate the
situation

ELECTRA

Attraction is a complication

RATH
It can be

ELECTRA
It happened to you before

RATH
Yes

ELECTRA
Who was she

RATH
Someone like me like you A pro

ELECTRA
What happened to her

RATH
She was taken
ELECTRA
Did you --
RATH
No I tried to stop it I
couldnt
ELECTRA

Was she the only one

RATH
After her I realized that to
survive I had to live without
Its dangerous to let things become
complicated

ELECTRA
Is this becoming complicated

RATH
Im not sure that I care anymore

He looks up from the game

ELECTRA
Were you attracted to me right away

RATH
No

ELECTRA
When did it start

RATH
Honestly

ELECTRA
Uh-huh

RATH

When I gave you my gun and you
almost shot me

ELECTRA
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist
RATH
Why

ELECTRA
That doesnt sound normal

RATH
Im not normal

ELECTRA
I know Thats why Im attracted to
you I mean you make me nervous

Youre intimidating Maybe its my
curiosityself-preservation thing
but all I can really think about
right now is kissing you

They rise up from the table together knocking over the
chess game The pieces fall to the floor

They grab at each other kissing both of them hungry
aggressive They tear at each others clothes and at
their own clothes it has a very awkward sense to it as
they become naked in front of each other There is
nothing smooth or fluid about it which makes it seem very

real

He takes her lifting her onto the table

She scoots and wiggles back the chess pieces falling out

of the way

She opens her legs and he moves in between them

ELECTRA
I wanted to tell you --

Her breath rushes out then back in

He smiles

ELECTRA
My real name is Anna

RATH
Martin

ELECTRA
Martin

Her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into

her

ELECTRA
Nice to meet you Martin
INT HOTEL PARAISO - HALL - NIGHT

Outside of the room we can hear the MUFFLED SOUNDS of TWO
PEOPLE MAKING LOVE

EXT COSTA BLANCA - NIGHT

We are MOVING DOWN the street LOW OVER the old
flagstones TOWARDS the marble statue that Bain shot

On the ground are the shattered pieces of the head
CLOSER

We see one of the pieces is part of the face the eyes
which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king

CLOSER
We MOVE INTO the blank white of that eye

DISSOLVE TO
WHITE SQUARE GLOSSED WITH LIGHT

We PULL BACK RISING UP and AWAY and see other squares
black and white like a chess board

A womans HIGH HEELS CLICK past

RISING HIGHER we see the woman walking A man crosses
behind her in another direction

HIGHER STILL and we realize that we are looking at the
black and white marble floor of the --

INT INTERNATIONAL BANCO DE MEXICO - DAY

It is a strange and beautiful bank

The ceilings are vast the suspended lights elaborate
baroque the enormous clock on the wall built to resemble
a sun

It looks almost as though it could be a museum with its
massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important

Mexican figures

Already it is crowded people and security guards moving
about beneath us

Rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers

EXT OUTDOOR CAFE
The cafe is off the plaza

Electra sits at a patio table Down the street she can
see the back of the burned-out hotel

She hears Rath in her ear-piece
RATH (VO)
All right Im in the bank Hell

She is nervous

ELECTRA

RATH

Rath is wearing a well-tailored gray silk suit and dark
sunglasses In his hand is a very large briefcase He
crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows

He hands Rath the receipt He glances at it checking the

Electra looks up over her book and Bain is there moving
down the side street gliding through the crowd with the
menacing indifference of a shark

INT BANK

The Official is talking to the teller in Spanish when
Electra whispers in Raths ear

ELECTRA
Hes here

Rath freezes

EXT CAFE

Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall
covered with bills and posters built to keep people out
of the burned hotel He is carrying a long nylon duffel
bag

At the corner a section of the plywood has been pulled
loose and Bain squeezes through into the hotel
ELECTRA
Hes inside

INT BANK

Rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs
set in pairs along the wall of the bank

He glances at the enormous clock which reads 1010 He
checks his Rolex

RATH
Now we wait

INT BURNED HOTEL PARAISO

The center of the hotel is open Interior hall balconies
which line each floor look down onto an old atrium
courtyard The fire did the most damage here spreading
easily throughout the entire building

The skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area has
been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing
broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened
floors and walls

Bain enters and carefully begins climbing the charred
staircase to the fifth floor

INT BURNED HOTEL ROOM

The room has been heavily burned stained black from
smoke The charred carpet crunches and cracks as Bain

walks across it to the window

As he nears the exterior wall several FLOOR BOARDS BREAK
with a brittle SNAP and he almost falls through

BAIN
Shit

He pulls his leg free

Outside the window across the plaza he sees the bank a
perfect site

Quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun
He grabs a magazine and snaps it into place
He aims down at the banks bright white stairs A man is

walking down the steps and Bain finds the center of his
forehead in the cross-hairs of the scope
Bain makes a gun noise followed by the sound of a head
bursting open

He giggles

Leaning against the wall in the shadows of the window
the gun in his lap he waits

Time slows to a crawl

Without taking his eye from the bank Bain rummages
through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes He pulls
one out with his lips and lights it

Taking a deep drag he lets the smoke slowly leak out and
drift up into the night

DISSOLVE TO
SUN

White hot

INT BURNED HOTEL ROOM

There are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened
window sill where Bain extinguishes another

BAIN
What in the fuck are you doing in
there

The room is hot a streak of sweat up his back and front
It is difficult to breathe

A man walks out of the bank wearing a suit similar to
Raths Bains body snaps erect rifle instantly leveled

He sights the mans head his finger tightening on the
trigger but he is not sure it is Rath

He looks over the scope looks back The man reaches the
bottom of the stairs Bains body sags

BAIN
Thats not him Jesus Bain baby
chill the fuck out

He takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his
forehead leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood

He again fumbles through his bag finding a container of
bottled water He chugs the whole thing

INT BANK
The Official walks over to Rath with a number of papers

sign

OFFICIAL
Your signature senor Everything
is ready

Rath signs them but does not get up

OFFICIAL
Excellent senor If you could
follow me

Electra is sipping at some iced tea dizzy at the thought

of all that money

ELECTRA
Ten million dollars sitting there
Waiting this is insane

INT BANK

There is a faint smile on Raths lips

EXT PLAZA

The shadows are getting longer

INT BURNED HOTEL ROOM

Bain is rocking back and forth breathing through his

teeth He has to urinate Bad

He is checking every face that comes out of the bank with

the scope Still nothing

BAIN
This is fucking insane
He grabs the empty plastic bottle unzips his pants and
begins refilling it

A man in a suit appears on the steps and Bain fumbles the
bottle spilling it as he lifts the gun It is not Rath

BAIN
Fucking God dammit

He hurls the bottle of piss across the room

INT BANK

The sun clock on the wall perfectly still reads 520
After a long beat a single minute clicks off

INT BURNED HOTEL ROOM

The sun is getting low The room much darker now

Bain sits at the window his body a knot

A large group of tourists flow out of the bank and Bains
eyes light up One by one the scope passes over each
face

They trickle down the steps and into the plaza

The stairs are again empty

Bain screams pounding the butt of the gun down splitting
open the floor

He looks at the bank Nothing He checks his watch In
fifteen minutes the bank will close

He stands up

EXT CAFE

Electra is watching the back of the hotel when Bain
emerges from the shadows

ELECTRA
Oh my God

He is moving like a bullet knocking into people who dont
get out of his way

ELECTRA
Hes coming

Rath looks up at the clock smiles

RATH
Four minutes

ELECTRA

RATH

I waited another four minutes

ELECTRA

Wait until he is on the stairs

ELECTRA
What
RATH
Last night --
EXT CAFE
Electra smiles
ELECTRA
Was nice
RATH

Yes

She sees Bain storming up the stairs She stands tosses
several bills on the table and leaves

INT BANK

Bain charges into the bank tearing off his sunglasses
scanning the room His face is a twisted grimace
streaked with black charcoal His body and clothes are
covered in sweat and large salt rings His breathing
labored

He sees Rath sitting comfortably calm his suit not even
wrinkled and realizes that Rath has been waiting for him

His first instinct is to turn and run but he stops
himself He is confused unsure

Then as though understanding he has no choice he puts
his sunglasses back on and strides over to Rath BOOTS
CLICKING against the polished MARBLE

Bain sits down in the leather chair across from him

BAIN
Howd you know Just tell me that
Howd you fucking know

RATH
I knew the same way in ten years
youre going to know

BAIN
What does that fucking mean

RATH
It means that Im going to tell you
things even though I already know
that youre not going to listen to a
God damned thing I say

INT BURNED HOTEL

Electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor then
navigates around a large hole towards the last room

INT BANK

RATH
Its irony Thats what it is But
the real irony is that you wont
know its irony until youre sitting
over here

Bain isnt listening Instead hes watching everyone who
walks near them

RATH
When you walked in here and you saw
me sitting here waiting the first
thing that went through your head
was that you were a dead man

This catches Bains ear
RATH
Youre thinking that youve been
sold out Thats the only way I
could know you were out there Why
would you think this Because you
dont trust your contractor You
dont trust anyone Its automatic
Its the first and last commandment
Its the only thing that keeps you
alive So try as I might to tell
you the truth you cant believe me
Do you see the irony of the
situation Its kind of funny
isnt it

Bain is not laughing

INT BURNED HOTEL ROOM

Inside the burned out closet Electra finds Bains nylon
duffel bag

Digging through it she finds his Gameboy his Walkman
his 22 ammunition clips and several issues of Soldier
Fortune and a Punisher comic book

The rifle is not here

INT BANK

RATH
Listen to me Bain Two days ago
you contacted your contractor who
told you that they knew when and
where I was going to pick up the
transferred money from MicroCell
You dont know how they got the
information It bothered you but
you didnt care How do I know
this Because ten years ago I was
sitting in that chair as scared
shitless as you are now

BAIN
I aint scared of you

RATH
Yeah you are and you hate it You
hate the fact that your hand is
shaking and mine isnt That youre
sweating your balls off and Im not
Youve got fear and hate in your
belly like battery acid all because
of me
BAIN
If you think you can take me quit
fucking bullshitting and try it

RATH
All right Bain Pay attention
because this is where everything
changes

INT BURNED HOTEL

Electra is beginning to panic She cannot find the gun
and has started looking in other rooms

INT BANK

RATH
Youre a businessman right This
is a business deal Behind that
counter I have over ten million
dollars Ill give you half of it
more money than youll make in the
next ten years if you walk away

Bains face changes muscles relaxing the tension
slipping out of him

BAIN
Five million dollars

RATH
Thats right

BAIN
Shit That sure is a lot of money

Bain is smiling

RATH
Did you see how I did that Magic
wasnt it

BAIN
What

RATH
You understand whats going on It
makes sense right

BAIN
Oh yeah

RATH
What I just said no assassin would
say What Ive said only a mark

They stare at each other

BAIN
You think I would be an idiot to
pass up five million dollars

RATH
You would be

BAIN
You dont know a fucking thing about
me You dont have the slightest
fucking clue

RATH
Why dont you tell me

BAIN
Ill tell you this After
Cleveland I thought I was lucky to
be alive But now here I just
realized that you were the lucky
one

RATH
Now Ill tell you something It
wouldnt fucking matter if I offered
you one hundred million dollars
Youd still be thinking the same
thing that youre going to take me
And here I am sitting through this
knowing its bullshit looking at
you and the only thing going on in
my mind the only thing I can think
is that in just a few minutes Im
going to take you

Bain jumps out of the seat

toward the stairs

Just as she grabs the rail she hears BAIN STORMING INTO

She begins climbing the stairs quickly but quietly

Bain is a rampaging beast lunging up the stairs

fifth floor There is no time

She slips into the closet as Bain whips around the corner
into the room He rushes to the window slamming himself
against it

BAIN
Youre gonna take me Come on
Come on motherfucker

He bends down and from the hole that he fell into pulls
out the assault rifle

BAIN
Take this Take this you fuck

Electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood
lathe

He pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through
the wall

BAIN

He stands suddenly perfectly still gun aimed at the

Electra silently ever so delicately opens her bag
lifting out her gun

His shoulders oozing blood Bain clenches his teeth and
rises listening as --

She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall

Beneath he moves to the railing and aims at the
staircase waiting until --

Electra freezes at the top of the stairs realizing that
they are exposed

She flashes her head quickly dipping back as the WALL is
PERFORATED with BULLETS

Fuck God damn bitch What are you
doing I dont believe this is
happening

She can hear him coming his voice ECHOING through the
hollow building She looks down the stairs the hall
above there is nowhere to go

Youre dead Youre fucking dead
Im going to kill you a hundred
fucking times for this

Bain FIRES up at the ceiling the BULLET tearing through
the floor WHIZZING past Electras head If she moves
hell know her position
He FIRES another

Electra sinks down her back against the wall and aims at
the floor

Another SHOT
She FIRES back

Bain closes as they both start FIRING silenced WEAPONS
flashing PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets

Her gun empties first
He laughs hearing the CLICK

BAIN
Game over bitch

RATH
Bain

Raths scream ECHOES up through the building

Before Bain can target him Rath is gone a shadow a
ghost He scans the hotels courtyard The last light
from the setting sun slips through the slits cracks and
broken window panes casting patterns a surreal dream-
like grid resembling a chess board

Electra sees her chance She leaps to her feet throwing
the gun over the balcony

The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she
races back to the room

BAIN
Fuck no

Rath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to
the fifth floor Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun
is empty

RATH
Shit

Bain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to
the end of the hall

Rath sees it all happening

RATH
Electra

Bain snaps into a targeting stance
Electra is flying toward the door her feet hardly
touching the floor --
TELESCOPIC SIGHT

When the cross-hairs find her back

BACK TO SCENE

RATH
Electra

Time becomes syrup

RATH
Down Get down

Bain FIRES

Electra dives

The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her
She bounces scrambling on all fours into the room

Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the
stairs

Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs Bain whips around and
FIRES the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back
down into the shadows

Ripping open Bains duffel bag Electra grabs Bains 22
Bain advances steadily the rifle trained on the door
Inside the room Electra grunts hurling the duffel bag out
the door It spins over the balcony and plummets to the

ground and bursts open

A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest
in the middle of the courtyard

Rath and Bain both see it
Staying hidden Rath immediately circles towards it

Bain sweats looking at the door down at the clip then
back at the door Somethings got to give

Unsure what to do Electra waits the gun clenched between
her two hands covering the empty dark space of the door

Bain makes his choice moving towards room 502
Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra He takes a
slow breath and tears from the shadows --

Bolting into the open Rath is focused wholly on the clip
the ground a blur beneath him --

Bain reacts the rifle swings rushing arcing after Rath

Two more steps and Rath dives sliding snagging the clip
as --

The RIFLE SPITS --

Rath screams his leg erupting with blood

TELESCOPIC SIGHT

The scope glides up zeroing the back of Raths head

BACK TO SCENE
Rath rams the clip in place

BAIN
Game --

Bain squeezes the trigger --
CLICK -- the rifle is empty Bain screams in disbelief

Rolling over Rath jacks back the slide and sights the
balcony but Bain is gone

Electra searches the room for a way out Keeping the gun
trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole
that Bain fell through

Grimacing Rath struggles to his feet

RATH
Electra

Bain explodes through the wall charred wood and plaster
flying

Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN
swallowing her

Limping lurching up the stairs Rath hears the CRASH

Jarred by the fall Electra drags herself away from the
open ceiling

RATH
The gun He needs the gun Get rid
of it Throw it

She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared She
looks at the gun thinking turning it over in her hands

His leg soaked with blood Rath rumbles down the hall

Black with soot Bain descends soundless serpent-like to
the fourth level through another burned opening

Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound at
every dark corner She is almost there when we see Bain

a shadow coming to life emerging behind her

Lumbering Rath is halfway there his eyes riveted on the
door to room 502

Hearing Bain Electra turns In one smooth motion he
snatches her arm and breaks her wrist The gun falls

Rath hears her scream

Electra kicks at his groin but he drops leg sweeping her
to the ground

She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face
jack-knifing her body back knocking her unconscious

Bain grabs the gun
Rath whips into the room BLASTING --

BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened
hole

Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead
Gently he turns her cradling her head her face smeared
with blood

From within the labyrinth Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH

BAIN (0S)
Hey Tell me something Bobby-boy

Electra comes to her eyes blinking open

BAIN (0S)
Are you still thinking that youre
going to take me

Electra is trying to focus as Rath listens to the voice
searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from
everywhere

BAIN (0S)
No I dont think you are You know
what I think

The voice is closer Rath wipes the stinging sweat from
his eyes

BAIN (0S)
I think youre thinking what Im
thinking

Still dizzy Electra taps her fist against Raths chest
BAIN (0S)

You know what Im thinking
Bobby-boy

It seems as though Bain is in the room

BAIN (0S)
You know what Im thinking

Electra opens her fist and inside Rath sees the handful of
bullets from the other gun

Bain whirls INTO VIEW his gun whipping around to Rath who
turns too slow

Bain pumps the trigger ONE CLICK ANOTHER And
ANOTHER The gun is empty

RATH
Yeah I know what youre thinking

He levels his gun

RATH
Game over

Rath FIRES OVER and OVER emptying the GUN into Bains
head and chest even as he crashes through the balcony
railing and falls twisting through lightless space
slamming to the stone floor dead

EXT PLAZA DEL SOL - NIGHT

The sun is gone the market is closing the crowd drifting
from the plaza

A man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley
beside the boarded hotel Although they walk a bit slow
leaning on one another they become it seems like just
another couple arm in arm holding tightly to each other
and to a very large suitcase

FADE OUT

THE END
