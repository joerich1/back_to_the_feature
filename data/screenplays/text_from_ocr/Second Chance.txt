TITLE CARD

“Luck only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades”
-— Dad

EXT FOREST - NIGHT
Pitch black night hides the hundred trees and DARK
DRESSED FIGURES moving quietly meticulously between

them

Rain pours down in buckets obliterating outlines of
everything living

Halogen flashlights pierce the dark rain In and out
back and forth between the trees scanning

Sets of heavy military boots slosh through the wet
ground Water being displaced by each footstep each
throwing water frontward and backwards

INT BOAT CABIN - NIGHT

A yellow light bulb from the molded ceiling sways gently
from exposed wiring It dims with the flash of lightning
outside Then the instant follow of a THUNDER CRASH

The heavy rains beats on the thin skin of the cabin
begging to come in - and it sounds as if it may

Thwup Thwup Thwup
sounds from somewhere within the room

Following the wires of the barely functioning light leads
in lazy loops across the ceiling Down the side wall and
to a black adapter connected to a car battery

Next to the battery the source of the repetitive Thwump
An old record goes round on a cheap player It too is
connected to the car battery somehow Next to it a car
speaker playing the sound
Thwump Thwump Thwump
The record is stuck

Polished shoes lie a short distance from the player
Connected to the shoes a MAN lies on his side with his
back exposed Wears a well-tailored suit and clipper-—
trimmed hair Sweat beads on the back of his neck

The light dims and sways just above the man

In front of the man a part of the cabin’s cramped
interior looks down upon the man The aluminum door in
the center On the sides covering almost every available
space PHOTOS

Tacked haphazardly the photos each one of a morbid
bloodied child-figure Several photos of each victim from
different angles Each figure staring down at the man

Thwump Thwump Thwump
from the radio player continues

EXT FOREST -— NIGHT
The well-trained combat boots still making their way
through the mud and rain The boots picking up intensity
the further they get

The halogen beams still cut into the rain The source of
the lamps - assault rifles Barely visible through the
rain

NT BOAT CABIN - NIGHT

A man’s sweaty face CLINT NEWCASTLE(30’S) stares ahead
His achievement wall in front of him staring back
Clint’s eyes are hollow looking through the wall of
photos at something he can’t see

Twump Thwump Thwump

The record’s cry for assistance continuing unheard

Clint’s face getting closer Closer until his eyes the
only things of interest He closes them
Blackness
INT DARKROOM - DAY
Thwump Thwump Thwump

The pitch black lightens a little A black light now
providing visual assistance

Clint stands over bins of developing solution fixing
chemicals onto several blank white photos

He pushes each one under the solution waiting for the
image to appear

His attention is taken away by the sound of the
malfunctioning record player in the corner

Thwump Thwump Thwump

CLINT
Shit

He leaves his work and goes over to the player Resets
the needle

A woman’s eerie voice howls behind smeared violins and
electronic sounds The woman’s voice a beautiful
otherworldly thing

Back at the developing bin Clint smiles at the ghostly
profiles revealing patterns Several photos of a young
girl gagged and bound and stuffed into a wooden box with
the top off Her coffin

Clint HUMS with the song
INT GUEST ROOM —- DAY

An empty white-walled room Several moving boxes sit on
the floor taped and ready to go

On one wall a black turnstile door turns Clint appears
within the turning door from his darkroom He closes the
top of a small photo-sized manila envelope and carries
the twelve-inch record beneath his arm
MRS NEWCASTLE (OS)
Don’t be gone too long Clint

Startled Clint looks up to see his wife MRS

NEWCASTLE (30’s) entering A wipe rag and spray bottle in
her hand She doesn’t look like the working type a
young busty blonde

MRS NEWCASTLE
You still need to pack

Clint stops a wry teenage smile on his face Gets
directly in front of his wife

CLINT
Just have to leave the keys with security

Clint motions to the manila envelope in his hands

CLINT
It’ll take me a half hour

Mrs Newcastle is already at the window cleaning the non-—
existent streaks

MRS NEWCASTLE
I know what your half hours are like

CLINT
Then you know when I’1l1 be back

Still grinning Clint turns to leave Taps the manila
envelope with his finger Leaves

Thwump Thwump Thwump

NIT BOAT CABIN —- NIGHT

Thwump Thwump Thwump

Clint sits on the wasted bed Tattered foam camping
mattress supporting him Head bowed slightly Still
looking at something unseen Searching

The rain still begging to get in Banging on each side of
the small claustrophobic space
On the wall the newest addition to Clint’s photo
collection The young girl in the wooden box Several new
photos tacked over several of the older photos

Clint looks up at the photos The scared young hurt
faces

Clint stands and moves towards the door Keeps his eyes
on the photos In particular the most recent one Finds
a rain coat within the cabin and gets in it Preparing
himself for the outside

INT TIDCO OFFICE TOWER - CEO OFFICE — DAY

Clint in business dress stands with hands clasped at
his back at the large windows overlooking the city
skyline The office is the type where the most powerful
people in the city meet

A plasma television on one wall plays the business report
with the sound down

Oak wood matching leather furniture and expensive oil
paintings adorn the office

A box of OFFICE BELONGINGS sits on the large desk

ASSISTANT (OS)
Everyone deserves a second chance Sir

The assistant’s voice awakens Clint from his daydream
Clint turns to his ASSISTANT(20’S) a young man with an
eager but honest face Clint puts the last of his things
in the box

CLINT
If it were as easy as that

Clint smiles at his assistant The assistant returns it
ASSISTANT
(to box)

Carry that to your car

CLINT
No Thanks Wanna pen
ASSISTANT
Sure

Clint throws an expensive silver pen across the room to
the assistant

The assistant catches it immediately inspects it
Realizes its worth Eyes get big

ASSISTANT
Wow Thanks Sir
(pause)
Good things happen to good people
(shakes pen)
You’ll see

CLINT
(chuckles)

Thanks Can’t wait

ASSISTANT
Good luck Sir

The assistant waves turns to leave

CLINT
Son

The assistant stops turns

CLINT
Quit calling me Sir

ASSISTANT
Sorry

The assistant smiles politely leaves

EXT FOREST -— NIGHT

The black-clad MILITARY FIGURES moving through the rain
and muck Weapons at the ready Halogen flashlights

moving with every movement of their rifles

Up ahead a clearing Lights from a house coming into
focus The figures moving straight for it Their target
INT BOAT CABIN - NIGHT

Clint buttons the rest of the buttons on the raincoat
Pulls the hood secure Clint goes for a gasoline can
nearby Douses every inch of the place with the liquid
Done throws the can on its own mess

Thwump Thwump Thwump

The radio still calling out

A match lit The bed quickly in flames

Clint leaves in a hurry taking the shovel leaning against
the wall with him

EXT BOAT - NIGHT

The flames of the burning floating trailer penetrating
the rain and darkness Not even the monsoon-like rain can
put it out

EXT MARSHLAND — NIGHT

A lightning FLASH lights up the thick fauna just enough
to show Clint shovel in hand heading somewhere in a
hurry The wet ground and maze-like vines pulling against
him

A BOOM from the chasing thunder

INT NEWCASTLE RESIDENCE -—- ENTERTAINMENT ROOM —- NIGHT
Large wood-trimmed twelve-food high ceilings surround
tons of packed moving boxes and cellophane-wrapped
furniture Even wrapped the expensive taste is apparent
Mrs Newcastle lays asleep on the plastic-wrapped sofa
The empty bottle of wine and wine glass on the floor her

reason for not caring where she slept

The rain knocks gently outside hiding the downpour
that’s actually occurring
EXT MARSHLAND — NIGHT

Clint stabs the shovel in the ground dumps the dirt to
the side Stab Dump Stab Dump Getting a good hole
formed

The wet dirt is easy work for Clint’s shovel The heavy
rain the only problem almost filling the hole as the
dirt’s removed

INT BOAT CABIN - NIGHT

Flames consume anything and everything

Beneath the roar of the flames the familiar

Thwump Thwump Thwump

of the record player

he pictures on the wall melt from the heat
The newest pictures of the girl in the box some of the
last to finally melt The figures wrinkling into black
nothing

Thwump Thwump Thwump

the sound picking up speed like someone’s turned the
player up to high speed

EXT FOREST -— NIGHT

Thwump Thwump Thwump Thwump

Sounding more like the blades of a helicopter

The black clad men at the clearing the backyard of a
large multiroomed isolated residence surrounded by
forest on all sides

A black POLICE HELICOPTER flies overhead placing a
spotlight within the backyard of the house and on the

house itself

As the men approach large SWAT insignias on the back
reveal the identities of the men
Each SWAT member takes an offensive position within the
residence’s backyard Aim weapons towards the house

More SWAT MEMBERS emerge from the shadows The entire
place is now surrounded by SWAT Despite the size of the
group and with help of the rain and thunder their
presence goes unnoticed

EXT MARSHLAND — NIGHT

Clint digging still Now waist deep in his own freshly
dug hole The next thrust of the shovel hits something
hard something other than earth

The water running off his raincoat

Clint continues Removes the dirt from the top of
whatever it is he’s hit Gets on his knees frantically
pulls the soaked dirt out with his hands

With most of the earth removed the outline of a wooden
box is now identifiable

EXT RESIDENCE —- NIGHT

The front of the colonial style Carolina mansion sits
alone in the rain The house has been there since the

Civil War A small “sold” sign waves back and forth in
the wind

Mossy Oak trees surround the front and line the drive
coming into the place The trees many years older than
the house

SWAT members coming from everywhere The entire front
like the back is surrounded They prepare themselves to
enter All have weapons trained and ready to kill

The helicopter still overhead its spotlight illuminating
the entire area

EXT MARSHLAND — NIGHT
Clint stands in the waist deep hole Pulls at the top of

the wooden box Finally the top budges Clint removes
the top and throws it on the formed dirt pile
Clint stands there a moment looking at the box’s
contents

In the box the GIRL from the picture bound and
gagged still lies in the box The rain hitting her face
Her eyes swollen from hours of crying Seeing Clint her
thankful eyes turn to fear

Clint lifts the weightless child from the box Sets her
on the ground next to him Unties her hands and mouth

The girl still visibly afraid shaking Recognizes Clint

CLINT
Go

The girl doesn’t move

CLINT
You can go

The shaking girl finds what remaining strength she has
and heads in the most accessible direction

Clint stops her She recoils
Clint turns her in the direction out of there
CLINT
Head that way until you hit the road
(points)

The girl looks obeys Gets going fast

Clint watches Lets the rain run down his face without
bothering it Smiles satisfied

INT NEWCASTLE RESIDENCE -— NIGHT
Mrs Newcastle still sleeping on the sofa

A BANG from the front door Someone forcing their way
inside

This startles Mrs Newcastle awake Immediately she

senses something wrong Reaches beneath the small sofa
cushion and pulls out a pistol

Another BANG followed by breaking glass from the rear of
the house

Mrs Newcastle holds the gun in a firing position
Defending herself

EXT RESIDENCE —- NIGHT

The SWAT team storms the house Every available exit has
been taken by armed swat members

Chaotic YELLING from within the house
Mrs Newcastle’s SCREAMS

A POP from a small caliber weapon is immediately followed
by SEMI AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE

Then all falls silent from within the house
The rain and the sound of the helicopter all that’s left
EXT MARSHLANDS —- NIGHT

Clint walking through the dark Knows the route well
Suddenly the rain lets up A light sprinkle now

Clint looks up Pulls his rain coat hood back Smiles a
wide happy smile Gets going Hums his favorite tune from

the old record

The sound getting lost in the darkness Like everything
else

FADE OUT

THE END
