FADE IN
EXT MANHATTAN CENTRAL PARK -— MORNING
Morning fog smothers Manhattans Central Park

ROBERT CHANDLER 50s runs the trails wearing a rubber weight-
loss suit He listens to an ipod sings along His breath
a crisp reminder of the December cold

Creedence Clearwater Revivals ‘Fortunate Son sets his pace

ROBERT
Some folks are born
Silver Spoon in hand
It aint me it aint me-

THWACK
A hooded figure rips him off the trail with lightning speed

Robert claws and kicks as the attacker pulls him into the
bushes

He strangles Robert with his own rubber top The rubber
conforms to his face with each airless gasp for life After
each breath the sadistic attackers grip loosens torturing
Robert with a taste of air in each desperate heave Finally
the attacker cinches Robert in an agonizing death embrace

Roberts body convulses and his flailing stops

The attacker snatches the watch from Roberts wrist and stands
over his victim

Roberts face is frozen in a haunting shroud of his last
breath

KATE
Well on one hand the Joker is
totally psycho and deviously
brilliant not unlike The Tailor

havoc Its all just sport to him
But the Tailor is far more primal
Hes willing to die for his goal

criminals Whats one man against
thousands

INT FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - MORNING
Detective Sanchez talks to Anne Kate listens from the hall

ANNE
It just sounds impossible

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ

Forensics doesnt lie Chandlers
DNA matches the Y-chromosome found
in the trace evidence left by his
attacker Since Chandler was the
sole surviving male of his family
the only possibility is that the
killer is his son

ANNE
This is crazy

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Is it

ANNE
But when Beth married Robert she
found she was unable to carry a child

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Well someone carried his child and
it came back to haunt him

Anne lowers her eyes shakes her head

ANNE
Poor Beth I wish I could help her

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Perhaps you can Sometimes the past
holds the key to solving murders in
the present

ANNE
I dont understand

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
According to sources Mr Chandler
used to be quite the ladies man
Perhaps he had an affair during the
time he was engaged to your sister

Kate enters the living room with her headphones
stops fakes surprise

She takes

ANNE
Kate this is Detective Sanchez

her headphones off

KATE
Detective

ANNE
Hes working on-

KATE
-Uncle Roberts case So glad to
meet you

She shakes his hand

KATE (CONTD)
Ive got a theory about his murder

ANNE
Kate not now

KATE
Detective Sanchez I write comic
books

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Okaaay

KATE
My uncles murder mirrors an obscure
technique that I used to killa
character in my comic

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Obscure technique

KATE
It cant be a coincidence

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Verrry interesting

KATE
My thoughts exactly So what Ive
determined-

He nods

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
So about the affair

ANNE
Excuse me

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Did you know of him having an affair

ANNE
No We were never that close

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Okay Is it possible Mr Chandler
had a baby before he was married
Perhaps gave it up for adoption

ANNE
I dont know Shouldnt you be asking
my sister these things

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
I already did Well If you think
of anything

books

Detective Sanchez searches his pockets for his card finds
it hands it to her

ANNE
May I ask you a question

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Shoot

ANNE
Hypothetically speaking if there
were an affair why do you think it
happened back then

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Its a hunch Im guessing his son
is in his twenties Mr Chandler
was no push-over at six-two two
hundred-thirty pounds The man had
to be very strong to kill him

ANNE
I see

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Youve got my card
