SUPER 64
FADE IN

On indistinct chatter from male voices They seem to be
having a good time

EXT PARK NEAR WOODS - LATE NIGHT
SUPER 1990

We see three friends LUE NICK and ANDY in their late
20’s partially dressed in military fatigue They sit atop
picnic table surrounded by empty beer cans and liquor
bottles

We come in towards the end of a story

NICK
That’s hilarious

ANDY
I know and Johnny comes running
out and runs right into it

They all laugh simultaneously Then silence

LUE

NICK
(to Lue)
Don’t you have a kid

LUE
That’s neither here nor there

NICK
You know you’re insane right Lue

LUE
Not clinically

A beat Nick states his claim

NICK
Well I don’t think so man I’m
kinda working my way back in good
favor with Julie
Lue and Andy look at each other shocked They turn to
Nick

LUE
I didn’t know Julie was in the
business of taking back deranged
sorry excuses for a human being

They chuckle

NICK
(humored)
Yea she apologized for that

ANDY
And

NICK
Annndd I stopped reading her
journal

LUE
(chuckling)
That’s great

ANDY
Isn’t she dating like some 18 year
old

Nick’s cell phone rings He takes it out of his jacket
pocket

NICK
Sshhhhbh

The phone covers nearly the whole side of his face as it’s
one of the first models Nick twists his body away from the
others He answers

NICK
HelloHey Julie I’m in the
movies right now can I call you
when I get outokay bye

ANDY
Starting it out on the right foot
huh

LUE

Gotta love Nick
NICK
Please She doesn’t love him
She’s probably at that trust fund
bastard’s house right now

LUE
So that’s where you got the phone

Nick smiles

ANDY
You two belong together

NICK

Yea well last time I waited too
long to try and patch things up

He points to his military fatigue Marines
NICK(CONT’D)
weeLl ain’t letting that happen

again

LUE
Fair enough

ANDY
Cheers boys

Big chug from all three

ANDY (CONTD)
Alright let’s roll

EXT PARKING LOT — SAME
Nick walks toward his car He takes another sip from a beer
bottle then taps the opening to his forehead as a goodbye

salute A car engine starts It’s Andy’s He drives off

Nick turns around and unzips his pants to a leek His head
tilts back

NICK
(relieving)
Mmmmm

He zips his pants back up Slightly staggering but
determined he turns and continue to his car

In the bg an outline of a light grey mask emerges
Nick staggers along Sipping the last half of his bottle
Finally he makes it to his car Parked close to the woods

He sets the bottle on the ground unlocks the car door
then carelessly plops down in the driver’s seat

NICK
Yes

INT CAR -
Nick slams the door shutIt’s quiet All of the windows

are frosted with minimal visibility However through the
drivers side window something seems to approach

He looks at the windshield Frosted

Better fix that Nick begins to insert the key but drops
them He searches blindly using only his hand Murmuring
a country song under his breath

After a moment he finds the keys

NICK
Ah ha Thought you got away

Sticks the key in the ignition Turns it to start when
A ROAR of heavy metal blasts through the speakers

Nick jumps out his skin and quickly turns the music
offThis sobers him a littlehe puts his palms in his eye

sockets and slowly takes a deep breath

NICK
Alright Get it together

Nick’S POV

He flicks on the headlights then the windshield wipers
and

Suddenly a figure appears

It stands there Tallmenacingan indistinguishable grey
blob where a face should be

Nick squints his eyes He knows who this is Smirks
The figure slowly walks around to the driver’s side window

Unthreatened Nick begins to roll down the window
NICK
Randy what in the

CRASH The Figure’s hand breaks through the glass and
wraps around Nick’s throat

Terrified Nick hits scratches and claws at The Figure

The Figure is not phased by any of this It looks down at
the ground and sees the empty beer bottle

Getting desperate Nick honks the horn Frantically
Honking for his life

The figure still strangling picks up the bottle
Breaks it on the side of the car
Then RAMS it into Nick’s head

Nick’s arms slowly stop moving Blood gushes from the side
of his face

From behind we see the figure step back examining its
work

The dead body of Nickimpelled beer bottle in his face
lifeless in the driver’s seat

EXT COLLEGE APARTMENTS — EARLY MORNING

SUPER PRESENT DAY

Sunshine caresses the side of an all brick apartment
building Oak trees run down grass and bushes provide the
landscape

INT COLLEGE APARTMENT — BEDROOM —

A male’s room Masculine Messy College memorabilia and
provocative posters decorate the walls

While music softly plays through computer speakers subtly
among the chaos of clutter we notice an individual asleep
on a futon crammed in the room

This is DERRICK PICHENS — 22 handsome athletic He slowly
opens his eyes A dreamy blue

Derrick turns over on his side facing the bed Something
peaks his interest
He wrinkles his forehead then raises his head to see over
To his delight a large bulge underneath the comforter He
smiles

Slowly he removes the blanket covering him tip-toes over
to the bed and leans over the frame of

RACHAEL — 22 pretty brunette She is on her side fast
asleep

Derrick softly peels the comforter from her body while
slowly climbing on top of her

He starts kissing her on her cheek shifts the hair from
her neck kisses her there

Rachael senses are stimulated by this His warm sensual
kisses She begins to smile enjoying the moment but
gradually her smile fades

RACHAEL
You can stop now

DERRICK
(still kissing)
What

She turns over on her back making Derrick raise up on his
arms His face drops Trails of dried up mascara tears
stain Rachael’s face

She shifts him off of her then sits up on the side of the
bed whipping her eyes

RACHAEL
Not what you expectedWell
neither was last night

She wants him to say something anything But he
speechless guilty doesn’t know what to do Or say

She walks into the bathroom and closes the door He rolls
onto his back and stressfully exhales Damn

RACHAEL (OS)
I just wanted you to understand
how I feel You know It can work

She pauses waiting on a response from Derrick Nothing
The faucet turns on He stops a love song playing on the

computerflops back on the bedcloses his eyes If only he
could wish this moment away
The faucet turns off and Rachael steps out Face clean
emotions exposed Derrick attempts to salvage the moment

DERRICK
Look Rach I

Derrick’s cell phone rings and interrupts

He looks at Rachael then the phone then back at Rachael
Reluctant Damn it

Finally he picks up the phone and looks at the caller id

DERRICK
It’s my mom

He answers

DERRICK
Hey mom

A beat He listensslowly his face saddens his head
drops

EXT CEMETERY — RAINY MORNING

A depressing and gloomy morning In the middle of a large
cemetery a small group of mourners dressed in black
shelter themselves with darkest of umbrellas

In the middle of the front row Derrick comforts his
mother GRACE PICHENS — a spiritual 50 year old as she
cries She rests her head on his shoulders

Extreme pain and sorrow pours from everyone’s eyes except
Derrick’s His eyes stare off into a space distant a
place of uncertainty

In the bg a MINISTER reads from the bible

MINISTER
For you will not leave my soul
among the dead or allow your godly
one to rot in the grave

Derrick looks at the headstone It reads top FEAR NOT AND
LOVE YET Center Here Lies James Pichens Bottom 48
wonderful years

INT GRACE’S HOUSE — DAY

The mood of the house is grim obviously but the inside
still speaks of comfort a sense of spiritual nurturing
Family pictures and Christian artifacts hanging on the
walls This is a house of love

Several grievers including Rachael sit around Grace and

hold small paper plates topped with comfort food Derrick
stands off to the side and stares through a window It’s

been a long day

He rouses out of his daze and turns to glances at picture
on the wall

Derrick walks over to the picture to get a closer view A
younger him posing gleefully with his late father

He stares at it intently absorbing that very moment
A hand gently touches him on his shoulder He turns
RACHAEL
I’m sorry I just came to see if

you were ok

DERRICK
Yeah

She embraces Derrick warming and loving His security
blanket They hug there for a moment

EXT GRACES’S FRONT DOOR — NIGHT
Grace hugs the remaining grievers as they leave
GRACE
Thank you for everything you’ve

done God bless you

The grievers walk down the pathway and Grace closes the
door

INT GRACE’S HOUSE —
Rachael sits on a living room chair and reads the program

from the funeral Across the way Derrick stands in the
family room and looks at a wall of pictures

Grace watches him in the doorway

GRACE
Did you eat something

DERRICK
I’m not hungry
GRACE
You know you’re father used to do
this

She moves toward Derrick

GRACE (CONT ’D)
He would stand there for hours
Just staring As if he were trying
to remember each one of those
moments

Derrick laughs at a picture he see’s of himself ina
Halloween costume He’s little Not even 1 years old A
Jason mask covers almost half his body

GRACE (CONT’D)
That was your first Halloween

DERRICK
I don’t even remember half these
pictures There’s grandpa I see
one wheres

GRACE

(cutting him off)
The other Your father never got
an opportunity to get close with
him As he got older he tried
He did But it was just an
unfortunate result of being too
young with children He went off
to the military and pretty much
tried to forget your father ever
existed Yet still your father
forgave him

She gestures towards a cross on the wall

GRACE (CONTD)
He thought it was important for
them to get reacquainted
As did I But Lord knows I
prayed for them Both Just like I
do for you Every night

Derrick barely cracks a smile

She smiles and turns his head to give him a kiss on the
cheek Rachael steps in the doorway hesitant
RACHAEL
Excuse me Mrs Pichens sorry I
didn’t mean to intrude but
Derrick your phone has been
vibrating non-stop I didn’t
know if it was an emergency

She hands the phone to Derrick He opens it TEXT MESSAGE
RESEARCH FOUND PARTYING ADDS 10 YRS 2 LIFE TANNER’S 10PM
2NITE

Derrick smiles of some relief

GRACE
It’s ok if you want to be with
your friends now

DERRICK
Mom no I don’tI don’t think
that’s the best idea It’s okay

GRACE
Oh Derrick I loved your
father Very much And I know
you did too But he was a very
sick man was for a long time
It’s a blessing he lived
this long

Grace starts to gently steer them out of the room

GRACE (CONT’D)
Plus you wouldn’t know how to
comfort old lady style anyway

IN THE LIVING ROOM

GRACE (CONTD)
Sheryl and Auntie Donna are coming
back to join me in a gorge fest
On the menu cakes and pies

They turn and smile apprehensive

GRACE
(sincere)
It’s ok I will be ok Come now
gather your things I’ll fix your
plates

Grace exits into the kitchen Derrick and Rachael begin to
collect their belongings

EXT GRACE’S FRONT DOOR —
Rachael hugs Grace with to go plates in hand

RACHAEL
Goodbye Mrs Pichens Again I am
very sorry for your loss

GRACE
Oh no need be child Even though
it hurts I take solace in knowing
that he’s in a better place

Rachael turns and walks towards the car Derrick passes
her walking from the car to the front door

He walks up to his mother barely able to look her in the
eyes She gives him a big hug

As he pulls away she slides a piece of paper in his hand
He looks at it

It is an address GRANDPA PICHENS- 847 COUNTY LINE ROAD

GRACE
I know you’re hurting Go and
visit him It might help the
healing

He kisses her on the cheek

DERRICK
Love you

He back pedals away from her and fades into the night

Music blares from the two story Sigma Alpha house Party
goers overflow out onto the balcony and front lawn

INT FRAT HOUSE —

The atmosphere is filled with inhibited party goers of all
races They entertain themselves as they dance chug beer
and play drinking games

Derrick leans in a doorway sipping a beer He watches the
dance floor almost therapeutically

INT FRAT HOUSE — KITCHEN —

Jam packed Standing room only in this spacious
traditional kitchen An assortment of liquor bottles and
juices fill the counter tops

Rachael and JENNIFER - 22 bubbly cheerleader type

JENNIFER
Did he ever explain why

RACHAEL
He was about to when his mother
called about his father

JENNIFER

RACHAEL
Keeping everything inside Like

up or give me some space I just

Rachael laughs

JENNIFER (CONT’D)

something

Rachael smiles masking uncertainty Jennifer knows it’s a
cover She assures Rachael
JENNIFER (CONT’D)
He’1l come around Rach and you

have a bunch of kids that I can
spoil rotten

Rachael looks around absorbing the environment She wakes
up out of the moment

RACHAEL
Whatever I don’t even want to
talk or think about it any more

JENNIFER
Well let’s hit the dance floor
then girl

They hold hands above the crowd and dance their way of out
the kitchen

INT FRAT HOUSE — COMMONS -

Derrick sees Jennifer and Rachael enter the room where
majority of the party goers are The dance floor He
catches eye contact with Rachael She looks good

He follows them with his eyes until his view is
interrupted by COLE frat boy all-American blonde A
little older than Derrick but still his right hand man He
greets Derrick

COLE

Derrick takes sip of beer Cole takes the hint

COLE (CONT ’D)
Let’s go then

Derrick follows Cole

A popular song plays in the party Everyone in the party
gets into the song

Derrick walks onto a small stage that is set up on the
floor Cole stands behind him while the crowd chants

CROWD
Dee Dee Dee Dee

COLE
Gotta start off slow

Cole lifts Derrick from behind and tosses him into the
crowd Derrick crowd surfs

Meanwhile Cole takes off his shirt grabs two champagne
bottles shakes them up and launches into the crowd
spraying champagne on everyone

EXT JOGGING PATH — NIGHT

The noise from the party is no longer heard A female
jogger and her black Lab run the trails of the nearby
woods The trail is well lit by tall standing lights along
the path

She listens to her IPOD while she runs A small container
of mace dangles next to an asthma pump on the back of her
shorts with each stride

She turns the corner focused on her strides

Sweat beads on her foreheadrunning with the pace of the
music comfortable in her rhythm the Lab keeps pace

panting but in shape He’s done this before

Suddenly the dog stops He senses something He sniffs the
ground for a scent

She jogs in place to keep up her heart beat Compares her
pulse to her stopwatch 120 bpm Right where she wants

She gently yanks the dog by the chain

JOGGER
Come on boy Come on

The dog obeys and they continue down the path when
Abruptly the dog stops again This time eating something
He gets her full attention now

JOGGER
What’re you doing boy What’s
She takes out one earpiece Kneels down

A FIGURE stands in the bushes next to her It’s the one
from before

She doesn’t notice

JOGGER
-NO Come on boy we gotta go

The dog spots The Figure He attack barks vicious He’s
more aware of the threat than she is

She tries to calm him down but he’s in full protect mode
Then suddenly a hair raising chill crawls up her spine

She feels a presence behind her reaches for the mace
behind her back turns her head slowly to reveal

Nothing Only the path she just traveledtrees blowing
in the wind She turns to the bushes a hollow darkness
where the figure stooduntil

OUT jumps The Figurelanding on top of the jogger knife
drawn a pale mask a Lewis chessmanshe wails out a cry
from her terrified soulthe Labrador hurdles onto the
figure in a vicious attack of protection

The Lab knocks The Figure off the jogger The knife barely
scraps her face from a thrust that was clearly intended for
deadly results She’s free

She rolls over lifts on her feet and darts off into a
dead sprint in less than a heartbeat Her eyes frantic-
horror struck

She looks back The Figure has the Lab by the throat and
breaks it’s neck He goes limp

Hysterical She runs as fast as she can Increasing her
distance from The Figure

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE JOGGING PATH -

She slows down at in intersection of other paths barely
able to catch her breath

A mixture of panic fear and exhaustion She reaches around
for her asthma pump and takes a puff

Her eyes squint as she scans her surroundings This is
unfamiliar territory

She tries to hold herself upplaces her hands on her
hipsHER CELL PHONE She almost forgot She opens it and
dials 911

OPERATOR
Nine one wha eiigency

JOGGER
Hello yes I’m on the Hopman trail

OPERATOR
Nine onehelone there

JOGGER
Yes I’m here I’m here please can
you hear me

OPERATOR
Hel0

She checks the signal strength One bar She hangs up Her
eyes shift as her thoughts race There is another way

She quickly sends a text CALL 911 IM IN PARK
LEAVES CRUNCH She jumps Time to get out of the open

Not far off the path she creeps into the woods and squats
behind a tree She can see the intersection where she is

Silence The CRUNCHES become closer Her heart beats
faster She closes her eyes in shear terror but not for
long

Slowly she opens her eyes peeks her head around the tree
A squirrel Just a squirrel runs around on the path

She exhales Turns around on the tree

BEEP BEEP BEEP Her cell phone goes off

JOLTED She fumbles to turn the sound offopens the
phone Text reply WHAT SERIOUS She resends the original
text

Leaves crunch She looks up A sign on another path reads
Restrooms and Exit- 14 miles Hope at last

She Closes the phone
Gently quietly stands up
THE FIGURE stands behind her She steps

JAM A knife goes into the side of her neck She falls to
her knees shocked gushing blood

THUD Her face hits the ground The Figure stands Her cell
phone rings

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS — GRASSY NULL — DAY

College students sprawl out around the open space Some
play catch with a football or frisbee others lay out on
blankets and read

Derrick and Cole fresh out of class walk along a concrete
path in the grass

COLE
Alright so what’s going on now

DERRICK
Yea I don’t know We’1ll see All I

offer in California at the last
career fair

COLE
Mmm Hmm

DERRICK
Well I was telling her that I
haven’t decided if I was gonna
accept it or not and she got
upset I guess she assumed that I
would just go with her to New
York

COLE
While she is in med school

DERRICK
Yeah So as I was explaining this
to her she starts talking about
our relationship and how we
would stay together If we would
stay together I mean of course I
considered it in my thought
process We’ve been together fours
years but

Cole looks confused It’s obvious this is Cole’s first time
hearing this
COLE
You don’t want to stay together
DERRICK

I’m ready to change my plans for
her just yet

COLE

COLE
Sounds like you’ve made up your
mind already

Derrick considers this

DERRICK
But then again she’s smart and
funny and beautiful She could be
the one And I don’t want to be
the idiot that passes that up
Wishing it was me married to her
instead of some fag

COLE
Deep I’m just glad it’s you and

Derrick realizes the stress of this situation again

the side of the road It is the extension of a front yard
The boys cross the street and zoom down

Continuously up the steep incline they pedal then turn
around and coast back down

Michael separates himself from the others and rides close
to the house whose yard they’re in It sits back almost a
quarter of mile from the street

He spots something on the ground by the side of the house

I’m told that is one of the
hardest schools to graduate from

COLE
More drop outs than Med school

They all share in the moment Then something puzzles Grace

GRACE
What about Jennifer

COLE
Oh she doesn’t finish for another
year Then she’1ll apply for grad
school

GRACE
And Derrick honey have you
decided what you were gonna do

Derrick shakes his head

DERRICK
Not at all
GRACE
Did you pray about it
DERRICK
Sort of
GRACE
Well it’s either you did or you
didn’t
DERRICK

Things have just been really
difficult right now you know with
dad and school

GRACE
Well that’s when you need to the
most

DERRICK

It’s just not my first instinct

GRACE
I was just like you Your father
until recent was just like you
It’s human nature to try to do
things on our own Solve our own
problems But there’s more to
this world than us And there’s
more to our problems than just to
satisfy our egos with a feeling of
self reliance We can’t do it all
on our own

Derrick listens but it doesn’t touch him like she’d hoped
Cole adds his thoughts

COLE
Yea but my man’s gonna be alright
I mean no offense Mrs Pichens
I hear you loud and clear but
Derrick’s just going through a
rough patch right now It happens
to all of us

GRACE
Oh yes indeed I agree it happens
to everyone But there is meaning
behind it The whole point of
those trials is to learn
something To bring you closer to
the one in charge And by doing so
you become a stronger person
A lot of times all you need to
keep you from going crazy is a
little faith Believing and
trusting that God is gonna work
everything out for your good That
way when it happens again or
similar circumstances arise
youre better prepared more
equipped for the fight The point
is not to come out the same
person as when you went in

A deep moment Derrick and Cole sit back in their seats
unsure of what to say Grace hones in on their discomfort

GRACE
But I didn’t mean to get preachy
on you boys so What brings you
this way

Derrick back to normal

DERRICK
Umm we are going to visit grandpa
Pichens

GRACE

Good Good Did something happen
to your car I didn’t recognize
you when you pulled in

DERRICK
Yeah I’m borrowing Rachael’s
Mine is in the shop ‘til tomorrow
GRACE
Ohthat’s right

DERRICK
Well we’re gonna get going mom

Derrick stands out of his chair and picks up everyone’s
plates Cole assists him

GRACE
Well thank you for stopping by

EXT GRACE’S FRONT DOOR —
Grace hugs the Cole as he stands in the doorway

GRACE
It was good seeing you again Cole

COLE
Same here Mrs P

He walks back to the car She hugs Derrick

GRACE
I love you Derrick I can’t say
that enough And no matter what
I will always be praying for you
But don’t you let it stop at that

He takes a deep breath sporting a half smile Barely
inspired

DERRICK
Ok mom

He kisses her on the cheek

DERRICK (CONT ’D)
Love you

Derrick walks to the car
INT NURSING HOME — HALLWAY - DAY

Rachael leans on the wall at the end of a long hallway
wearing medical scrubs We can tell by the frustration in
her voice the conversation is not going her way

RACHAEL

A black female CO-WORKER peeks her head through a door
adjacent to where Rachael stands She whispers to Rachael

CO-WORKER
Mr Bob

Rachael acknowledges the co-worker

RACHAEL
Dad Dad I have to go

Rachael hangs up the phone teary eyed but not crying She
closes her eyes takes a deep breath and try’s to re-
gather herself into work mode

INT NURSING HOME —

Rachael enters in the door from the hallway She hurries
through the lobby to where the bedrooms are located

Rachael musters up a smile hoping no one senses the
instability of her life right now She makes it to the
room Before entering she pauses a second then opens the
door

NANCY an older no nonsense head nurse is already helping
MR BOB into his bed He is frail barely able to support
himself

Rachael scurry’s into the room and attempts to assist

RACHAEL
Nancy oh thank you so much I’m
sorry that took much longer than I
expected

Nancy continues to maneuver Mr Bob as if Rachael never
said a word
They finally situate him in his bed Nancy grabs his chart
and begins to write The silence torments Rachael Finally

NANCY
This is the third time this week

RACHAEL
I know I’m really sorry

Nancy closes the chart emphatically

NANCY
That’s not gonna cut it You
do good work around here that’s
why you’re still here Don’t make
me regret that decision

All Rachael can do is stand there and take it Nancy
doesn’t care She walks out leaving Rachael with Mr Bob

MR BOB
You’re OK kid Keep your head
up I sure as hell wish I could

Rachael appreciates the humor
EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS — BASKETBALL COURT — DAY

The sun beams down on a shirts and skins pick-up basketball
game played by college students

Outside the lines more students prepare for their turn A
few girls dispersed along the sideline eyeball the
beefcakes Just another hang out spot for the students on
campus

On the court Derrick and Cole compete in an intense battle
Filling out their team is JAMAL ANDREW and
DANNYathletic college students

Andrew penetrates baseline from the corner A defender
steps up Andrew floats the ball to the basket in an
attempt to shot over the defender

SWAT The shot is blocked and knocked back to Derrick

Derrick catches the ball behind the three point line He
dribbles once then blows past his defender

In the paint he quickly bounce passes to Jamal who
finishes the play with a monster dunk

JAMAL
15- 14 game point
Ww
Ww

The other team takes their time with the ball They dribble
up the court methodically patient waiting for something
to open up

The offense tries desperately to free themselves from their
defender Finally a man breaks free and pops open for the
three They pass it He shoots SWOOSH Nothing but net
Game over

The winners celebrate Derrick’s team stands on the court
in disbelief They walk over to the bleachers and sit
obviously upset and exhausted

DERRICK
(to Danny)
It’s alright Next time just
switch Switch on everything

Danny accepts the criticism

DERRICK (CONT’D)
He won’t make that with a hand in
his face

DANNY
That was my bad

They all try to catch their breath

COLE
That was a good game though

ANDREW
Yea for you guys You got Jamal
dunking on everybody Derrick
draining three’s Cole and Danny
dominating inside and out I
probably wouldn’t have scored on
Helen Keller

They all laugh

JAMAL
And yet you seem surprised at
that

ANDREW

Again we all know basketball is
not my thing

DANNY
And what is your thing
ANDREW
Ask your girl

They all chuckle at Andrew’s cheap shot

JAMAL
Ooh No points for originality
Still leaves you scoreless

COLE
(to Andrew)
That’s the best shot you’ve taken
all day

DERRICK
I’m afraid Helen might’ve blocked
that one too

This brings out an uproar of laughter from the group

DERRICK (CONT ’D)
I’m sorry

INT CLASSROOM — DAY

A sign on the classroom door reads Tutoring and Private
Study Mon-Thurs 2pm-6pm

Students sit sprinkled throughout the room receiving
tutoring studying

In the middle of the room Rachael sits at a table for six
by herself Her attention struggles to stay on the books in
front of her

Jennifer walks into the room and sits at the table
JENNIFER
Hey where’ve you been I called

you like 3 times

RACHAEL
I’ve been in here all afternoon

JENNIFER

Did you hear what happened
RACHAEL

What
JENNIFER

Between Tiffany and Eric
Rachael shakes her head Somebody else’s problems are not
even a second thought right now

RACHAEL
I don’t care about them

JENNIFER
Oh well just trying to keep you
in the loop

RACHAEL
I’m so out of the loop it’s not
even funny And the best part is
I don’t even care anymore

JENNIFER
Well you were never one for
gossip anyway

RACHAEL
It’s not that It’s my dad

JENNIFER
He won’t help

RACHAEL
Nope

Jennifer pauses for a moment Familiar with the workings of
Rachael’s family

JENNIFER
That skank

RACHAEL
Yup

JENNIFER

Does Derrick still have your car
or is he planning another not
really gay but sort of is trip
with Cole

RACHAEL
What do you mean He went to visit
his grandfather

JENNIFER
Yea he took Cole I swear those
two just

This is news to Rachael Jennifer stops mid sentence after
she notices her expression
JENNIFER (CONT ’D)
He didn’t tell you they were
going

Rachael doesn’t answer She can’t answer Her anger builds
leaving her speechless

Jennifer realizing what she might have caused tries to
rationalize

JENNIFER
Calm down Rachael

Rachael sits back in her chair She can’t believe it She
begins to quickly pack her belongings

JENNIFER (CONT’D)
Rach he probably forgot0r didn’t
think it was a big deal

RACHAEL
Big Deal He didn’t even ask me
Jennifer He made it seem like
they were just going to some
random place Not to meet someone
who could be important in his
life

As Rachael scoots away from the table her chair screeches
All the students look at them Rachael could care less
while she loads the remainder of her belongings
Jennifer plays it off to the students in the room
JENNIFER
(whisper )
Sorry
Jennifer stands up with Rachael and follows her out

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS — BASKETBALL COURT — DAY

Derrick and his team continue to hangout on the bleachers
Now other students have joined the group

The ball busting carries on

ANDREW
Jamal you went like 8 for 20if I
shot 20 shots I’d have 20 points
too You’re not that good
JAMAL

This guy is clearly overestimating
his skills

They all laugh Shaun approaches the group from the crowd
of spectators

SHAUN
What’s up people

They acknowledge hin

SHAUN
Yo did you guys here

He peaks their interest

COLE
About what

SHAUN
About that chick The jogger

DANNY
The one that was missing

DERRICK
Oh yea my mom told me about it

SHAUN
They found her body in Duffer
Park Throat slit from ear to ear
Something shoved into her head
like a hat or crown And her face
mashed in and carved

This grosses out some FEMALE STUDENTS sitting with them
couple of bleached blondes

FEMALE STUDENT 1
Oh good the plastic surgeon from
hell

FEMALE STUDENT 2
That’s disgusting

SHAUN
(to female student 2)
Kinda makes you rethink that work
you were gonna get huh

They all laugh She punches him in the arm
SHAUN
But the weird thing is that she
is not the only person they found
like that I heard they found a
girl by Sandy river a few months
ago almost exactly the same way
Different people like that over
the past 20 years Almost 60
people Mangled

DERRICK
Why the hell are you telling us
this

SHAUN

So if you hear a loud noise you
don’t go investigate like a
dumbass

FEMALE STUDENT 1
I heard it may have something to
do with chessboard or a checker
board

SHAUN
That’s a new twist on things Sick
huh Offing people for some sort
of evil chess game

ANDREW
That’s a stupid reason

FEMALE STUDENT 2
Is there a good one

ANDREW
Yea Being blonde in a scary
movie

They all burst out laughing

COLE
Don’t take it out on her because
you couldn’t score

SHAUN
But the real question is who are
they playing against

Derrick continues to listen to the conversation until a
voice from behind interrupts
WOMAN’S VOICE(OS)
Good game

Derrick turns around familiar with this innocent voice
It’s Kelly

DERRICK
Thanks Kelly I played alright

KELLY
I saw you making shots That is
still the object of the game
right
Derrick tries to hide his flattery
DERRICK
Yes but we still loss How long
were you watching

KELLY
Long enough

They look at each other almost in their own world while
the others talk around them

EXT CAMPUS BULDING - DAY
Out from a campus building Rachael and Jennifer step They
stand in the doorway Not far from the courts Not far from

Derrick and Kelly

Rachael shakes her head in disbelief A sarcastic grin
tells it all

She pretends to ignore this and walks in Derrick’s
direction In plain eye view Jennifer knows not to follow
her this time

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS — BASKETBALL COURTS - CONTINUTED

Derrick barely able to take his eyes off Kelly glances up
and spots Rachael walking past him

DERRICK
Oh youll have to excuse me

He runs after Rachael

DERRICK (CONT’D)
Hey RachRachael wait up

She keeps walking He walks faster to keep up
DERRICK
Jeez slow downwhat’s wrongare

She keeps walking No response Derrick thinks to himself
What could be wrong

DERRICK(CONT’D)
You’re not mad because I was
talking to her

RACHAEL
Oh please you know me better than
that She’s not a threat

DERRICK
Then what is it What’s wrong

Rachael stops

RACHAEL
Did you borrow my car to take Cole
and meet your grandfather

DERRICK
Yea

PissedShe can’t even talk She just turns and walks He
follows right behind her

DERRICK
You’re mad at that Cole and I
have always gone places without
you or Jennifer I didn’t think

RACHAEL

No Why would I Why would I want
to go with my boyfriend who I
don’t know I LOVE and share in
the first ever meeting of his
grandfather Why wouldn’t I want
to do that

(beat)
I mean was I even a consideration

DERRICK
Well I didn’t think

RACHAEL
That’s the problem sometimes
Derrick you don’t think You
didn’t think I’d care about that

RACHAEL (CONTD)
You didn’t think to tell me
earlier that you doubt New York
And this relationship

Derrick grabs her by the arm and stops her

DERRICK
Whoa whoa that’s not fair You
know what I’ve been going through

RACHAEL
Derrick with all do respect to
your father’s passing I’m sorry
I really am But you knew I would
be there for you No questions
asked We all have our problems
We all go through stuff Or is
that something you didn’t
think about

She turns to walk away Derrick follows her

DERRICK

You already know how much I care
about you How much I love you

I already told you thatwhat else
do you want from me

Rachael stops As does he
RACHAEL
How bout showing me Derrickhow

She storms off Leaving Derrick with that thought
EXT JENNIFERS APARTMENT — NIGHT

The night is calm and quiet Only a slight wind creeps
through the trees every now and then

INT JENNIFER’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME

Jennifer’s bedroom matches her personalitycutegirly
She sits in front of a vanity mirror and brushes her hair
She has on her pajamas but doesn’t look ready for bed

In fact she looks like she is prepping for something else
A photo on her mirror stops her from brushing It is of

Cole herself Derrick and Rachael all smiles in
restaurant booth She smiles a nostalgic moment

She continues to groom and after a few strokes her hair is
exactly the way she wants it

Satisfied she goes over to lie in her bedturns on the
TVa rare showing of Scream The garage scene

As soon as she gets comfortable she reaches for her
drinking glass on the nightstand empty Just great Time
to refill

INT JENNIFER’S APARTMENT — KITCHEN —

Jennifer flicks on the lights as she walks through the
apartment and to the kitchen sink

Hovered over the sink she turns the faucet on and fills up
the glass The apartment is quiet almost eerie She hums a
tune to dispel that feeling

The glass is finally full She grabs a couple ice cubes
from the freezer then turns out the light

A SILOHOUETE OF A MAN stands behind the closed blinds in
the living roomilluminated by the porch light

The eerie pose looks familiar It’s The Figure She doesn’t
see him

She turns the light back onwalks over to a basket of
magazines on the counter and grabs oneturns the lights
back offThe Figure is no longer there

Back to her room she walks turning off each light

INT JENNIFER’S APARTMENT — BEDROOM —

Jennifer sets her glass on the nightstand then gets
comfortable again thumbing through magazine pages

A SHADOW walks past her windowagain she doesn’t see it
The wind blows gently outside You can just hear it over

stops Something doesn’t feel right She mutes the
television

It’s silent untilLEAVES CRUNCH by her window She turns
her headthat grabs her full attention

She focuses in on the window then
DING DONG She jumps The doorbell startles her

She walks to the front door and checks the peep hole She
opens the door Cole stands waiting to see her face

Cole laughs then mocks her scariness

COLE
Ahh Ahh Cole help me Please

JENNIFER
Shut up

He approaches her seductively Whispers in her ear

COLE
But I do apologize Next time I’1l
try to scare these off

his arms and kisses him He carries her back to the room

JENNIFER
Oh yea

COLE

Jennifer turns around Intrigued by his comment

JENNIFER

She walks over and stands in front of him

JENNIFER (CONTD)

JENNIFER
Why
COLE
Cause I might have to use it one
day
JENNIFER

Oh no no no Romeo Yours is

She gives him a kiss

He smiles then grabs her hands Honesty in his eyes Sure
of himself and their relationship

COLE
Hey I’m sure it’s popped in your
head since the whole Derrick and
Rachael thing but uh don’t

This brings a smile to Jennifer’s face

JENNIFER
Alright I guess you can go now

She pulls him by the hand and leads the way to the front
door

EXT JENNIFERS APARTMENT — FRONT DOOR

Cole steps out but before he walks off turns around to
give Jennifer another kiss

COLE

He turns and walks off Jennifer watches him for a moment
then closes the door

EXT JENNIFER’S APARTMENT — PARKING LOT

Cole wrestles with his keys in his pocket as he approaches
his truck A red F-150 He opens the car door

A hand reaches from behind and yanks Cole’s head back by
his hair

It’s The FigureCole sees him from a reflection off the
small window behind the driver side

The parking lot lights make it clear The mask huge
eyesindifferent expressionevil

Cole in his attempt to fight back pulls the keys from his
pocket His cell phone pops out with it It falls to the
ground

The Figure drags Cole in the headlock position He can’t
scream Cole feverishly tries to jab the keys into The
Figure’s face

That’s enough The Figure throws Cole into the bushes
takes out a knifeCole stops The Figure’s deadly thrust

With the other hand The Figure grabs Cole’s
throatpressing downslowly squeezing the life out of
him Cole squirms violently until he’s dead

The Figure looks at Cole breathing heavy

Cricket’s chirp wildly in the night

He turns his head to the apartments He’s not done yet

INT JENNIFER’S BEDROOM — SAME

A toilet flushes Jennifer opens the bathroom door and
turns off the light

She has a new glow about her now As she climbs onto the
disheveled bed she notices something on her nightstand
it’s Cole’s wallet He definitely needs this

Jennifer grabs the cordless phone sitting on her nightstand
and starts dialing

She fiddle’s with the wallet while she waits for Cole to
pick up

Voicemail She hangs up gathers the half empty glass of
water and other small trash then walks to the kitchen
Only the light from her room illuminates her path

She places the cup in the sink and throws the trash away
Better try again She presses redialopens the
refrigerator and pulls out an apple a big and juicy one

Just before she bits into it a noise from a distance
distracts her She twists her head to listen It sounds
like a cell phone

What the hell She redials then listen’s intently It is
his phone She peeks out the blinds

Cole’s truck gone The tiny light from his cell phone can
be seen clearly

She open’s the front door a bit leery The phone stops
ringing and goes to voicemail The light on the ground goes
off It’s his phone alright

The breeze slightly picks up She walks from her apartment
attentivekeeping her head on a swivelsnatches the phone
off the ground then heads back to her apartment
INT JENNIFER’S APARTMENT — BEDROOM —

Jennifer walks in She places the phone and wallet on her
nightstand The apartment seems quietpeaceful

She walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower To add
to her security she closes the room door

As she walks back into the bathroom she pulls the t-shirt
over her head and closes the bathroom door

INT BATHROOM — MINUTES LATER

Steam fills the bathroom like a dense fog The water
continues to pour over Jennifer’s body She stands there
soaking in every hot water drop

Clean she turns the shower head off Her eyes a little
tired now and her hair drenched She rings it out pulls
the shower curtain back

Jennifer reaches over to the towel rack to her left Not to
get her floor soaked she wraps one around her head and the
other around her body

She steps out and stands in front of the mirror wipes it
to check the towel The mirror doesn’t stay that way long
She wipes it againevery thing’s in its place She opens
the door

THE FIGURE stands there She screams in shock The Figure
holds up a knifethrusts down

INT RACHAEL’S BEDROOM — MORNING

Rachael wakes up to a blaring alarm She turns it off then
lays there a second Her eyes stare off

She reaches over and picks up her cell phone ON CELL

3 MISSED CALLS FROM DERRICK She rolls over in her bed
Wanting to hear his voice

INT RACHAEL’S BATHROOM

Rachael brushes her teeth with her ear glued to the cell
phone We hear Derrick’s message

DERRICK
(from phone)
If you could find anyway to
forgive me I just Please
please call me back I’m at home

She pauses in mid-brush The vulnerability in Derrick’s
voice is something she rarely hears She absorbs every word
of it

The automated VOICEMAIL OPERATOR speaks

End of messages If you would like
to delete this message press

Rachael hangs up She takes a deep breath sensing what’s
next The phone call But not yet She continues brushing

EXT COUNTRY ROAD — DAY

A broken down car with its hood propped up sits on the
side of the road It’s Rachael’s car She’s on the phone

She steps out the car with her nurses scrubs on A cloud of
smoke pours from the engine She waves the smoke out of her
face then speaks into her phone

RACHAEL
I’m sorry could you repeat that

WOMAN
(from phone)
I said I do not see you in the
computer as a Triple A member
Would it be under another name or
address

RACHAEL
No

WOMAN
Would you like me to call a towing
service truck in your area

RACHAEL
How much would a tow cost

WOMAN
I’m not sure It would depend on
the company

RACHAEL
Not cheap though huh

WOMAN
Probably not

That shoots down Rachael’s spirit
WOMAN
Is there anything else I can help
you with

RACHAEL
No Thank you

She hangs up Hot and bothered
The frustration on her face is unmistakable Plus sounds
of the cars speeding by don’t help

She checks under the hood again Nothing but metal and
chaos Way beyond her expertise A puff of smoke shoots at
her face The icing on the cake

She storms back to the driver’s seat Slams the door shut
INT RACHAEL’S CAR

A beat Rachael sits there a moment It might be time to
make that call She stares at her phone A bit hesitant
But she goes for it She picks up the phone and calls him
It rings

On the road a red truck approaches from behind It looks
familiar It’s Cole’s Rachael waits on the phone for an
answer

The truck zooms by Only a glimpse of The Figure a dark

shadow sits in the driver’s seat Rachael looks up as it
passes She doesn’t think twice

DERRICK

Derrick stands up and walks about his room

DERRICK
I mean things have just been

situation instead I make things
worse

RACHAEL
Babe

DERRICK
I know I haven’t been the best
boyfriend lately

RACHAEL
Derrick that’s not true
DERRICK
Well
RACHAEL

No it’s not I didn’t mean to
hint at that either

DERRICK
I do feel like I’ve started to
take you for granted a little Not
being able to see what’s right in
front of me That’s not me

Rachael empathizes with him

RACHAEL
You’re just struggling with
trying to figure out how to handle
things just as I am That’s all

Your independence kills me
sometimes

Rachael smiles a moment then back to the topic at hand

RACHAEL

DERRICK

RACHAEL
I’1l call you

DERRICK
I love you Be careful And call
me immediately if you can’t get

RACHAEL

She hangs up
INT DERRICK’S BEDROOM - DAY

Derrick hangs up He sits on his futon again and places the
school book in his lap

He tries to study but can’t He stares off This progress
this growth in his relationship takes his focus away

EXT COUNTRY ROAD — DAY -

Rachael walks along the side of the road slowly
approaching the address written on the sheet of paper

She stops Across the street from the house

A two story rotting farm style house is her destination
It sits far off from the street With a slope leading off
the road to the beginning of the front yard The same front
yard the little boys were in

The house has no mailbox She looks back at the one she
passed

It’s too far to read the numbers But she knows it read
846 She looks at the paper This is the house

A red truck sits in front of the house Rachael thinks
nothing of it other than someone must be home

She runs across the street and down the slope into the
front yard Destination front door The sun shines on the
house It creates a beautiful backdrop Almost giving ita
serene approachable appeal

She walks past the truck then stops Wait a minute She
gives it another look This can’t be Cole’s She looks
through the window

A grey fabric interior Nothing special She feels silly
Why would Cole be here anyway She heads up to the front
door

INT COLE’S TRUCK

A blood stained picture of Cole and Jennifer lye’s on the
drivers side floor

EXT OLD HOUSE — FRONT DOOR

Rachael walks up the steps to the front door The wind
picks up a little She moves her hair out of her face and
gives the front a few knocks

She waits for someone to answer Nothing happens

She knocks a few more times then waits Again nothing
This is starting to look like an unsuccessful trip

SQUEAK BANG She turns her head to the left

SQUEAK BANG The sound of a screen door opening and
slamming shut She walks down the stairs and around the
left side of the house To the back

A large sprawling back yard Endless dead grass

SQUEAK BANG She listens pinpointing its location
She walks around the back of the house to the right side

SQUEAK BANG A clear eye view of the screen door opening

then shutting She walks up the steps leading to the screen
door

The house is open

RACHAEL
Hello

Rachael grips the screen door handle She holds it
partially open

RACHAEL (CONTD)
Hello

She starts to open it but decides against it
RACHAEL (CONT’D)
(to self)
Don’t be stupid Rachael It’s a
big house

She closes the screen door and gives it harder knocks

RACHAEL (CONTD)
Is there a Mr Pichens here

She turns around and waits
A SHADOWY FIGURE MOVES IN THE HOUSE

Rachael takes out her cell phone and opens it to make a
call This is getting nowhere

She walks down the steps around to the front of the house
not noticing the bear trap that rests close to the steps

IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

Rachael walks around with the phone to her ear voicemail
It’s Jennifer’s She looks back at the house then pauses

The front door is wide open She hangs up the phone That
door was definitely closed before Someone must be leaving

She walks to the front door anticipating seeing someone
thereshe looks at the door Not a soul

She walks up the stairs and stands in the doorway The
house is empty No furniture Nothing It’s impossible for
the door to have opened by itself She walks in
RACHAEL
Hello Is anybody here The front
door was wide open

Rachael tenses up She walks through the roomfrom the
structural layout a living roomturns right and

SQUEAK BANG

Rachael jumps Someone stands at the end of the hallway
She can barely make them out It’s dark where the face
should be

Rachael collects herself

RACHAEL
Oh I’m sorry You scared me

She catches her breath
RACHAEL (CONTD)
Um you don’t know me but I’m
Derrick’s girlfriend Rachael

The shape begins to walk towards Rachael

Rachael continues unsuspecting

RACHAEL (CONT’D)

I was having some trouble with my
car and he said it would be cool
if I stopped by It’s just up the
road

No response That’s a little creepy

RACHAEL (CONTD)
Would you be able to help

No response again That’s definitely creepy She squints
her eyes to focus better on his face It’s a mask It’s The
Figure

Her eyes widen and
INT POLICE STATION — DUSK APPROACHING

The police station is highly active Phones ring off the
hookarresting officers question perpslocals sit and
wait to report crime

In the middle of the station two men sit across from each
other Both of their desks pushed together to make one
Similar to the desks surrounding them

Detective Sanchez listens on the phone His name plate
looks old and weathered Piles of paper cover his desk
He’s a busy man

DET SANCHEZ
Yes ma’am I understand that it’s
been three weeks but you have to
understand also that

The person on the other end cuts him off He listens to
them talk A sip of coffee keeps him attentive

Suddenly a stack of papers are placed in front of him The
hand on top of those papers belongs to DETECTIVE MURRAY
his younger as-a-matter-of-fact type partner His name
plate looks fresh and new Indeed the new guy to the job

He looks at Det Sanchez anxious for the call to end
Sanchez not wanting to be rude waits for the right moment
to wrap the conversation

DET SANCHEZ
Absolutely and we’ve got our guys
working hard for that information

DET SANCHEZ (CONTD)
As I mentioned before stolen
property especially in your case
automobiles takes time We don’t
want to arrest the wrong people
wasting your time my time and
tax payer’s dollars You have my
word that I’1l1 call you when we
have new informationthank you

He hangs up

DET MURRAY
Mrs Pollack

DET SANCHEZ
You know it

DET MURRAY
What I put in front of you will
make you forget all of your
annoying phone calls today

Sanchez picks up the papers

DET SANCHEZ
What is it

DET MURRAY
What does it look like to you

Sanchez stares at a picture A close up of a chess figure
The LEWIS CHESSMAN WITH A HAND ON THE CHEEK AND A DEATHLY
BLANK EXPRESSION

Behind the chessman picture a sketch drawing similar to
the chess piece

DET SANCHEZ
It’s the same picture as the
witness description

DET MURRAY
Almost exact One of the boys on
street figured it out It’s a
Lewis Chessman That one’s the
queen piece

DET SANCHEZ
And they say playing games will
get you nowhere

Sanchez ponders the correlation between the pictures
DET SANCHEZ
The media nailed this one
Chessboard killer huh

DET MURRAY
What are you thinking

DET SANCHEZ
I think we’re dealing with a
complete and utter lunatic Maybe

even psychotic this is the most
anybody’s figured out from this
case

Murray agrees with that but has his own thoughts instead
He stares at the pictures in front of Sanchez

Sanchez takes notice

DET SANCHEZ
I want to know what the new guy is
thinking

DET MURRAY
Truthfully from what I’ve seen I
wouldn’t even give him those human
characteristics We might have
surpassed that

DET SANCHEZ
You’re probably right

Murray continues in thought

DET MURRAY
So we’re going with chessboards

Sanchez scans through the pictures Each sketch matched
with the actual picture of the Lewis chessmen

DET SANCHEZ
Honestly I don’t know I just
don’t want to believe that there’s
evil like that in the world
Giving him a killing pattern
humanizes him

A phone in front of Murray rings He answers

DET MURRAY
This is Murray

Murray writes on a piece of paper

DET MURRAY (CONT’D)
w-Thank you

Murray hangs up Sanchez looks up from the pictures

DET MURRAY (CONT’D)
That was county I think we may
have a family link

DET SANCHEZ
Really

DET MURRAY
A close friend of the first
victim Traced all the way to a
Grace Pichens

DET SANCHEZ
I don’t think I know a Grace

Murray thinks to himself He’s had run-ins with a Pichens

DET MURRAY
I know her son

DET SANCHEZ
Let’s get some addresses and take
a visit

INT BASEMENT — NIGHT

Rachael wakes up on the basement floor groggy unaware of
her surroundings She looks around for some understanding
A clue Anything Only the moonlight from a rusted window
aids her

Voices can be heard from a distance It sounds like two men
talking Muffled Like from a TV

CLING CLING She looks up to see chains hanging from the
ceiling Some sort of make shift death trap Blood splatter
on the chains look black Fresh They’ve been used
recently

It’s time to get the hell out of here She starts on her
search for an exit Feeling her way through

She scans the room the only things visible are a work
bench a few tools hanging from the walla do it yourself
type home workbench She turns around

A door It has a small window that lets a speckle of light
in It must lead to the outside She crawls over to the
door Reaches for the handle It doesn’t have one

It must be a push door She pushes No budge She puts her
back on the door and uses her feet to push harder Same
result Damn it

Rachael spots her purse on the floor The remnants of it
anyway It’s turned inside out The contents scattered
around it

She crawls over to the contents Feeling then tossing
Nothing She picks up her wallet Tosses it

RACHAEL
Come on come on

She finds her cell phoneflips it openNO SIGNAL Damn
it She tosses it

CREEEEEEEAK Rachael freezes What the hell was that
Quietly she picks up her purse Turns it upside down

Nothing

CREEEEEAK She whips her head to the left Another door
with stairs leading up to it This door leads into the
house and the sound must be the floor boards Somebodys
out there

Rachael crawls over to the work bench Her eyes stay glued
to the door She reaches up searches A knife She grabs
it then tip-toes over to the stairs and up to the door

She places her ear next to it and reaches for the door
knob twists it slowly not to make a sound

EverSogently she pulls the door open One eye barely
peeks through Nothing but hallway Dark hallway with open
doors

She softly closes the door That’s not going to work
There’s got to be another way

She tip-toes back down the stairsclimbs atop the work
bench to try the window She can see the ground outside
It’s eye level to her But the glass thick She checks the
window it’s sealed She’s not getting out this way

The only way out for sure is on the other side of the
doorthrough the house She turns around then

In the corner she notices a shape The outline of a body

She hops of the table and quickly finds her cell phone
opens it shines the light in that direction

It’s Jennifer Oh God She looks damn near catatonic

RACHAEL
(softly)
Jenn

Rachael scurry’s over She shakes Jennifer’s shoulders

RACHAEL
Jenn come on we have too

Jennifer’s head rolls off and hits the ground Rachael
jolts backwards Screaming into her hand

Her eyes begin to water She looks awayunable to bare
the sight when

CREEEEEEEEAK This time it’s louder Closer She quickly
finds the knife and holds it for dear life There’1ll be two
headless bodies if she doesn’t leave

Scared out of her mind she heads towards the door Her
hands tremble as she makes her way up the stairs

First things first She takes a peek through the crack on
the bottom Nothing No movement She puts her ear up to
the door The house is quiet

She reaches up and feels the knob But before she turns to
open it an onslaught of emotions come over her Scariness
fear doubt She starts to cry A somber moment

Finally she pulls herself together She wipes her eyes and
with every courage bone in her body twist the door knob
Cracking the door open

INT HOUSE — HALLWAY

Rachael looks through and waits a moment No movement

Now is her chance She opens the door An inch at a time
Just enough for her to slide through Knife in hand

She crotches in the corner near the door The end of the
hallway she stood earlier Tense Collecting her strength
She finally stands Ready

Gently lightly carefully Rachael shuffles down the hall
Her back glued to the wall The first open door on her
side approaching

She squeezes the knife grip Strict terror in her eyes

Rachael steps over to the opposite side of the hallplants
her back to it and continues to shuffleher body now
facing the open dooran empty roomone down two to go

Rachael continues to shuffle The next open door
approaching She crosses over to the opposite side
againanother empty room

The moonlight becomes brighter It fills up this area of
the house A window must be nearby A big one at that
Maybe the kitchen

She approaches the third and final open door in the
hallway on the opposite side A partially opened door on
her side It’s opened outwardly A closet

Hesitant she takes a step when the floor board creaks
beneath hershe stops

CREEEEAK From another portion of the house
Instinctively she slides into the closet Leaving it
cracked open As it was originally

She watches waits Her brown eyes glimmer in the
moonlightshe waits

Suddenly somebody walks past the closet door It’s The
Figurecreeping through the housesheer fright screams
from Rachael’s eyes

The Figure stopswalks towards the moonlit room Rachael
can see his shadow The Figure just stands

This is it Rachael senses the moment
An image of Jennifer flashes in her mind Dead
decapitated This may be her only shot at The Figure and an

escape

She clutches the knife then

Blasts through the closet door knife above her head
deadly intent in her eyes

The Figure quickly turns and stops Rachael’s thrusts

She karate kicks his gut Her hands are free now but the
knife falls The Figure grabs her throat He clutches with
a vice grip squeeze

Rachael falls to her knees Grabbing her throat The
Figure chokes the life out of her with every second

She’s losing this battle Her hand drops her hands and
feelsthe knife
She picks it up and

Plunges the knife in The Figure’s thighpulls it out then
jams it in his shoulder The Figure falls to his knees

Rachael slides back and sidekicks him in the face He’s
down She darts towards the moonlight The only light in
the house

It leads her through the kitchen and out the screen door

EXT HOUSE —

Rachael quick steps down the stairs Headlights approach on
the not too distant street

SNAP

RACHAEL
Aaahhhhhhhhbh

Rachael falls to the ground and screams in agony The car
zooms past

She grabs at her leg It’s caught in the bear trap She
can’t stop now

Rachael digs deep to muster any strength she has left to
lift herself up Her face tells it all The pain The fear

She hobbles through the grass towards the street Her last
chance

INT HOUSE - HALLWAY

The Figure pulls the knife out of his shoulder then drops
it on the ground

He stands up and walks towards the kitchen Unaffected Not
missing a step

EXT HOUSE —
Rachael hobbles as fast as she can In the bg The Figure
is seen exiting out the screen door Rachael looks back and

sees him

She’s not getting away The Figure picks up a pitchfork and
sprints towards Rachael A deadly chase

Rachael pushes forward She can’t go any faster

RACHAEL
(screaming)
HEEEEELP OH GOD PLEASE

SOMEBODY HELP ME
The Figure closes in

In the distance another set of headlights round the
corner headed her direction Her eyes light up

The Figure gets closer

She gives it one last push She’s almost there

She reaches out and

The pitchfork jabs through her chest jerking her forward
Rachael drops to her knees Her eyes bugged in shock She
wheezes for air

Before the car can get close she drops dead on her face

INT CAR

As the car whizzes past The Figure just stands Only the
pitchfork handle is seen sticking up from the ground

INT DERRICK’S BEDROOM — NIGHT

Derrick drools on his school books in a deep sleep

Ding Dong The doorbell rings He doesn’t flinch A slight
pause Ding Dong It rings again this time jolting him out

of his sleep

He gets up slow walks to the front door and opens it
Danny walks in A book bag around his shoulders

DANNY
Hey man I forgot my key

Danny throws the book bag on the couch then notices
Derrick’s eyes

DANNY (CONT’D)
Oh did I wake you

DERRICK
You can say that
Derrick walks back to his room
checks his phone No missed calls He picks up his text
book and starts reading Danny walks in

DANNY
My bad

DERRICK
Nah I was supposed to be studying
anyway
(yawning)
What time is it

DANNY
Ten

Danny turns on the TV then sits on the couch A female
NEWSREPORTER speaks

NEWSREPORTER
It is still not clear if the
police have arrested any suspects
Authorities say that this latest
killing is similar to several over
the past couple of years and may
go back further than that

Derrick looks through some mail on the kitchen table Not
even giving the report a thought

NEWSREPORTER (CONT ’D)
And get this John they are
starting to believe that there is
more behind the killings and that
even though none of the victims
knew each other there is and I
quote “some evil game being played
and we are all just pawns” Police
are urging everyone to be very
aware of their surroundings not
to be alone at night and be
particularly careful when talking
to strangers

DANNY (CONT’D)
Did you eat yet

DERRICK
Earlier

DANNY
Dude I’m freaking starvin’ you
wanna go get something

He sits down on the bed and
Derrick’s stomach growls They look at each other

EXT COLLEGE TOWN DINER

Derrick and Danny sit at a table outside a local diner
Other customers sit outside as well They look young

Around Derrick and Danny’s age Probably college students

Derrick chomps down on a burger and a shake Danny bites
into a greasy chili cheese hotdog

DANNY
How long were you studying
DERRICK
I don’t know Like four hours off
and on
DANNY
Hmm
DERRICK

I can’t look at another word

DANNY

The brain can only take so much
DERRICK

Yea I’m probably done for the

night
Derrick watches Danny engulf the last of his dog

DANNY
Mmmmm

DERRICK
I don’t see how you and Cole can
eat that slop

DANNY
Are you kidding me I could eat
these bad boys all day

DERRICK
I guess if you like studying on
the toilet

DANNY
I wouldn’t have a problem with
that It’s quiet no distractions
private I think more people would
be productive if they worked out
of the bathroom

Derrick laughs to himself What the hell is this guy
talking about

DANNY
I’m just saying don’t knock me
for trying to be productive and
stay regular at the same time

DERRICK
You’re really talking about this

Danny realizes how dumb the topic is

DANNY
I’m a little tired

DERRICK
(balling up trash)
A little retarded

Derrick picks up his tray and walks over to the trash can

He waits in line behind a woman Blonde hair She empties
her trash and turns around It’s Kelly

KELLY
Hey

DERRICK
Hey What’s up

Derrick empties his tray and places it on top of the
garbage can They move over to the side it

KELLY
What is this like the third time
in two days I’m running into you

DERRICK
It’s a small world

KELLY
A small town

Derrick shoves his hands in his pockets

DERRICK
So are you here with friends

KELLY
Yeah a group of us are sitting
over there

She turns her head to a group of college aged girls
outside

KELLY (CONT ’D)
You work over in the college of
business

DERRICK
No I’m a business major

KELLY
Oh ok Well ever since we had
intro to business together I’ve

Derrick senses what’s about to happen He cuts her
DERRICK
Um I’m involved with someone
KELLY

DERRICK

I have a girlfriend that I’m in
love with

Kelly looks at Derrick confused Her look confuses
KELLY
Well that’s great but it’s not
what I wanted to ask you

Kelly suddenly realizes Derrick’s presumption

KELLY (CONT ’D)
Did you think I was gonna ask you

DERRICK
Uh You weren’t

KELLY
No

DERRICK

Oh I’m sorry it just seemed like
there were some flirtatious vibes
between us

KELLY
Just now

seated

DERRICK
Lately Every time I’ve seen you

KELLY
From me or from you Because I’ve
never flirted with you

Derrick thinks to himself Maybe there weren’t any He
feels like an idiot now

DERRICK
Wow I’m sorryII’m sorry This
is really embarrassing now

Kelly laughs it off

KELLY
It’s ok That’s not the first time
that’s happened to me I get it
from my mother

Derrick eases up a bit

KELLY (CONT ’D)
No I’m interested in pursuing a
double major and business is one
of my considerations I was
wondering if you could give me a
tour and tell me the in’s and
out’s of the program Or if not
you maybe someone else Someone
real Someone in the program who
won’t just tell me what they think
I want to hear

DERRICK

way you need to now After what I

She smiles

KELLY
It’s ok My boyfriend won’t hold
it against you Was that your
girlfriend walking away with you
near the basketball courts

Derrick chuckles to himself thinking back to that moment

DERRICK
Yes
KELLY
Seemed pretty intense You guys
must really care for each other

Derrick smiles

KELLY (CONT ’D)
I guess we’re the lucky ones As
crazy as this world is

DERRICK
I guess so

In the bg Kelly’s FRIENDS appear

FRIEND

Kelly turns to them then back to Derrick

KELLY
I gotta get going
(walking away)
But the next time I run into you

program right

DERRICK
Yes Yes we will

Kelly leaves with her friends Derrick walks back over
his table Danny stares at him

DERRICK

DANNY
Who was that

DERRICK
An old classmate

DANNY
That was the longest garbage can
conversation I’ve ever seen

DERRICK
What are you trying to say

Danny raises his eyebrows You know what

DERRICK
No I don’t do that

DANNY
Well good for you

Derrick looks at his cell phone

DERRICK
Are you ready to go

DANNY
Yea it’s bout time we head back
Somebody’s waiting to give us

Derrick looks at him confused
INT DERRICK’S APARTMENT — LATER

EXT GRACE’S HOUSE — NIGHT

Derrick’s car pulls up in front of the house He gets out
and walks up to the door

INT GRACE’S HOUSE

Grace sits on the couch with the Minister from the funeral
Two other men standDetective’s Murray and Sanchez

Derrick walks through the front door He recognizes one of
the detective’s faces unfortunately He walks over and
greets his mom with a kiss on the cheek curious to know
what’s going on

He acknowledges the minister with a head nod

DERRICK
Sir

GRACE
Derrick this is Detective’s Murray
and Sanchez

DETECTIVE MURRAY
Hello Derrick

DERRICK
Detective Murray You got a
promotion

Grace looks confused

GRACE
You know this man

Derrick eyeballs Detective Murray

DERRICK
Weve been introduced

GRACE
Derrick they’re
DETECTIVE MURRAY
(intruding)
We’re here just to ask a couple of
questions That’s all

DERRICK
About what

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Derrick have you heard of Laura
Morgan

DERRICK
No

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
What about Dustin Taylor

DERRICK
No Who are these people and why
do you keep asking if I know who
they are

DETECTIVE MURRAY
How about Lucious or Lue Pichens

Derrick stares daggers at Murray

DERRICK
He’s my grandfather Why

GRACE
Derrick they think your
grandfather is some chessboard
killer

DERRICK
A chessboard killer What the hell
is this That doesn’t even sound
real

GRACE
Watch your language young man

DET SANCHEZ

Be that as it may we have reason
to believe that your grandfather
may be associated with a number of
killings over the last 20 years
64 to be exact Possibly starting
with a Mr Nicholas Mays in 1990
Your grandfather’s best friend

Derrick shakes his head He doesn’t believe one word
DET SANCHEZ (CONTD)
This is all after careful analysis
of the evidence There was a
slippage in the investigation and
your grandfather was never
questioned So the murders
continued Chessboard killer
that’s the media mainly but it
makes since 64 the number of
spaces on a chess board All of
the victims carved mutilated
positioned to what they think are
to look like chessboard figures

DERRICK
Did you put him up to this Murray

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
That’s not how it works

DERRICK
This is the reasons that you have
or you’ve concocted

GRACE
Derrick have some manners

DERRICK
Where’s the concrete evidence

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
Other than that we are not at
liberty to say

DERRICK
Of course

GRACE
Derrick

Detective Murray’s heard enough

DETECTIVE MURRAY
(darkly serious)

Have you seen him Derrick Have
you seen his evil What he has
done to his victims The fear that
screams from the eyes of their
lifeless bodies This isn’t a
game It’s real And it’s right at
your door steps

Spooked This drastically shifts the mood in the house
Grace tries to hide her now arising terror
DET SANCHEZ
We have no known address for him

Derrick’s not buying the Detective’s approach He starts
get upset

DERRICK
Do you know who you are talking
about You are talking about my
father’s father My recently
deceased father’s father Who was
a great man

Grace tries to gather her thoughts

GRACE
Look I think we all need to just
calm down a bit

DERRICK
Mom do you see what they are
trying to do

GRACE
Derrick

Grace gets frustrated with him He’s not helping at all
She quickly calms herself

GRACE (CONTD)
I’m sorry Detectives This
couldn’t have come at worse time

DETECTIVE MURRAY
Yes ma’am we understand

MINISTER
Grace I probably should go now

GRACE
No

She addresses the detectives

GRACE (CONT’D)
Maybe you should come back another
time

DETECTIVE MURRAY
Ms Pichens

GRACE
MrsPichensand I think it’s time
for you gentlemen leave Please

to
Detective Sanchez grabs the arm of Det Murray They’ve
definitely overstayed their welcome It’s time to go

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
We’re sorry ma’am

Grace walks them to the door Det Sanchez reaches into
jacket pocket and pulls out a business card

DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
You will call

Grace nods then closes the door
EXT GRACE’S HOUSE — DRIVEWAY

Detective Murray and Sanchez walk back to a car An
unmarked Crown Victoria They get in

DET MURRAY
That went well

DET SANCHEZ
You were right We’ll talk to
Chief tomorrow about setting up a
tail on him ASAP
Detective Murray nods in agreement
INT GRACE’S HOUSE — LIVING ROOM
Grace stands facing the door
GRACE
I’m sorry I just needed for you

to stay

She turns and looks at the Minister He looks at her
understanding why now

GRACE
Derrick how did you know those
men

DERRICK

I just know Murray I’ve never met
the other one

GRACE
How do you know him

his

It’s not a good reason Derrick knows it This is not the

time to tell it
DERRICK
Let’s just say he’s been to our
campus more than enough times

Grace wants to get upset but she can’t There is bigger
news on her plate She stares at a cross on the wall

DERRICK
How did my dad find him

GRACE
I suppose he knew who to ask

DERRICK
Who did he ask

GRACE
I don’t know I guess it wasn’t
important anymore after he found
him

The minister sits on the couch uneasy As if he’s ready to
release whatever he’s been thinking Finally he speaks

MINISTER
He was a murderer from the
beginning not holding to the
truth for there is no truth in
him When he lies he speaks his
native language for he is a liar
and the father of lies You belong
to your father the devil and you
want to carry out your fathers
desire John eight verse forty
four

GRACE
James was never like that

MINISTER
Of course not

He turns to the cross on the wall

MINISTER (CONTD)
For he died so we would not have
to be slaves to itI knew James
He was a great man as indeed you
stated Derrick But for some
people even with the bondage and
pain starring them in their face
don’t turn away They want it

MINISTER(CONT’D)
That might be why your father
couldn’t get close with him Too
much love in his spirit

GRACE
Derrick didn’t you and Cole go
visit him

DERRICK
Yes But he wasn’t there Just an
old house

MINISTER
There is something James wanted me
to keep secret However I feel
this is no time for secrets

Grace and Derrick are all ears

MINISTER(CONT’D)
James was starting to think
something was wrong He new this
man was his father but any time
he looked into his eyes Darkness
Nothing but impenetrable
darkness He didn’t want to say it
but I knew what he was thinking

Derrick attempts to understand what he just heard

DERRICK
Wait a minute Let me get this
straight you’re saying that not
only is my grandfather some mass
chessboard killer but that he is
the devil

MINISTER
No son I’m merely suggesting that
your grandfather is or maybe pure
evil in human form

The Minister’s scary accusation weighs heavy on Grace
Derrick

GRACE
I don’t know what to say

The Minister attempts to comfort her

and

MINISTER
A thief comes only to steal and
kill and destroy I have come that
they may have life and have it
more abundantly John ten verse

DERRICK
This doesn’t make since Isn’t he
too old

MINISTER
How old do you have to be to be a
murderer

DERRICK
But isn’t he like eighty
something

GRACE
No remember after your father’s
funeral I told you he was young
when your father was born Barely
15 yrs old

DERRICK
That’s how old my dad was when I
was born That makes him what

They all calculate in their heads

DERRICK (CONTD)

This still doesn’t make since to Derrick He rests his

hands on his hand Soaking everything in Rachael just went

to his grandfather’s house for help He looks at his cell

phone 12 O’CLOCK Still no missed calls

DERRICK
I have to go mom

He gives her a kiss on the cheek then rushes out

GRACE
WhaDerrick

He closes the door
EXT GRACE’S HOUSE — DRIVEWAY
Derrick quickly walks to his car He takes out his pho

and speed dials It ringsvoicemail It’s Rachael’s
hangs up

ne
He

He gets in his car then backs out of the driveway
EXT DRIVEWAY

Derrick’s headlights shine as they roll into the driveway
off the street The same driveway the same house that
Rachael walked to Cole’s truck gone

INT DERRICK’S CAR

Derrick holds his cell phone to his ear He stops not too
far from the street and turns off his head lights

DERRICK
(in to phone)
Hey Cole it’s me Call me back as
soon as you get this No jokes

Derrick hangs up

He sits for a moment looking at the house Unsure of what
he’s about to get into A cross dangles from his rearview
mirror He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath

He opens his glove compartment The light in the
compartment shines on a gun On top of it a picture

Derrick picks up the picture It is of his mom dad and
himself They look happy

He turns it over On the back reads I AM THE GATE WHOEVER
ENTERS THROUGH ME WILL BE SAVED HE WILL COME IN AND GO OUT
AND FIND PASTURE JOHN 109 LOVE MOM

Derrick looks at the gun-- a 9mm puts the picture back on
top of it and closes the compartment

EXT DRIVEWAY -

Derrick steps out the car and closes the door Not trying
to be quiet He looks at the house A Dark and lifeless
shell

The night sounds of the birds and insects fill the air He
walks up the stairs to the front door and gives it a couple
of knocks

No answer

He knocks a little harder Nothing

He steps back from the door and down the stairs glances

over the windows of the house Motionless He’s not getting
anywhere Not tonight

He looks at his watch It’s late 104 Too late for an old
man He scans the windows one last time

A CURTAIN MOVES UPSTAIRS Someone’s inside Derricks rushes
back to the door and bangs this time

DERRICK
Hello Mr Pichens It’s Derri

The door squeaks open slightly Derrick stops He calls
up to the window

DERRICK
Hellothe door is open

He slowly opens the door completely The moonlight
brightens old fashion furniture in the room

He hesitates to step in but does so cautiously

DERRICK
Hello

IN THE HOUSE
No response This is weird

DERRICK
It’s Derrick Your grandson I’m
sorry to wake you

Derrick begins to walk through the room

DERRICK(CONT’D)
I came by earlier this week and
left some pictures under your
door Of my father Your sonI
left my number on the back

Derrick searches the walls with his hands A light switch
He flicks it up and down Broken

He turns down the main hallway Stops A staircase sits at
the end of it open room doors each side

A quick look back Everything remains still He turns back
RACHAEL
(faint)

Derrick

Derrick looks down a small adjacent hallway Rachael sits
leaned up against the wall She’s alive He runs to her
DERRICK
Rachael Oh my God

Her shirt is blood soaked

DERRICK (CONTD)
What happened

Derrick touches her lightly on her stomach her legs her
arms He has no clue what to do

Rachael grabs his shirt Weak Clinging to life

RACHAEL
I can’t He’s

DERRICK
What What What is it

Tears start to roll down her face

RACHAEL
Derrick

DERRICK
Where are you bleeding

He frantically searches her

RACHAEL
I’m sorry

Rachael begins to choke on blood
DERRICK
No No No I’m sorry I’m sorry
Hold on Rachael Just hold on
Derrick attempts to lift Rachael

DERRICK (CONT’D)
Come on

A cracked door behind Derrick opens a little

DERRICK
Ok Let’s go

He finally gets her on her feet
The door opens all the way A shape becomes visible

THE FIGURE steps out

Rachael’s eyes widen She sees him

RACHAEL
Derrick

He turns around

The Figure SWINGS his armslicing Derrick’s throat from
ear to ear

Derrick clinches his throat The blood overflows from
behind his hand Rachael cry’s

RACHAEL
Derrick

She lunges at The Figure in a weak attempt to save Derrick
The Figure tosses her to the ground

Derrick uses whatever strength he has to fight back It’s
no use The Figure brushes it off Derrick slides off The
Figure to the floor

Rachael and Derrick look each other in the eyes There’s
nothing she can do No way to save him She crawls down the
hall Keeping an eye on Derrick Her love Dying

The Figure raises his arm for the final strike

RACHAEL
NOooooo

The knife thrusts into Derrick’s stomach Rachael crawls
backwards around the corner Down the hallway with the
stair case at the end

She looks left and sees the open front door It’s too late
to turn around She’ll never make She thinks fast

Rachael takes off her shoe and tosses it down the hallway
It hits the bottom of the staircase She then crawls into
one of the rooms but leaves the door open Don’t want to
make it obvious

The Figure watches as Derrick’s life slowly bleeds away He
yanks the knife out of Derrick’s stomach turns to see
the hallway is empty

The Figure walks down the hall Slow In no hurry He stops
at the end of the hallway The front door is still open He
looks down the hallway with the staircase A shoe sits at
the bottom of it

He starts down the hallway Towards the shoe

INT THE FIGURE’S HOUSE — ROOM

Rachael can hear his foot steps They get louder with each
step She quietly presses herself up against the wall

Not to be seen if he walked by She winces in pain in
fear

The Figure walks by the room His steps become softer He’s
walking away Rachael listens

CREAK CREAK CREAK CREAK He’s walking up the stairs He
fell for it She continues to listen to his foot steps
He’s nowhere close She slowly peeks her head out the room

All clear

She crawls out of the room and down the hallway Covering
as much ground as she can as quick as she caninto the
living room Only a few more feet and she’s out free

She slides through the moonlight andShe’s here She made
it She looks at the stairs leading into the front yard
Derrick’s car Yes One more look just to be safe

She turns around No one behind her She looks back
outside Starts to crawl

Suddenly The Figure grabs her leg and slides her back in
He slams the door shut

Rachael crawls away Faster than before But getting
nowhere

The Figure walks up behind her grabs her shirt and rolls
her over Rachael looks up at him terrified out of her
mind

He straddles hertakes off the maskit’s pitch black
where his face should be He raises his foot then

Stamps down on her throat pushing harder and harder A
subtle grunt with each press Rachael has no chance

She grabs The Figure’s leg No effect Finally her hands
fall She’s dead The Figure hovers over Rachael when

RACHAEL (VO )
(whisper )
Derrick

INT CAR — NIGHT

Derrick opens his eyes He sits in his car in the driveway
What in the hell He imagined it

A cross dangles from his rearview mirror

He wipes his face and opens the glove compartment The gun
rests on top a stack of papers No picture over it He
grabs the gun and closes the compartment

Time for the real thing He opens the door But before he
steps out takes one last look at the cross There’s no way
he can win without it Not without him on his side

He snatches the cross then puts it in his pocket
EXT DRIVEWAY

Derrick cautiously approaches the house Gun in hand He
eyes all the windows Still Just as he imagined before
He walks up the front door steps Slow steady gripping
the gun tighter with each step

He stops in front of the door It sits there closed
Waiting to be opened

An owl hoots in the bg Derrick turns his head to the
street Pitch Black Everything about him tenses up

He checks the door knob It’s unlocked Slowly he twists
the door knob and opens it The room is basically empty
Only two chairs and a table in the middle

Nothing like he imagined
INT HOUSE
Derrick walks in Quiet Barely able to hear his own steps

A car passes by on the street He turns The red tail
lights disappear in the night

He turns to the table Something sits on top of it He
walks over to get a better view A chessboard Half the
pieces are missing

In the middle of the board random pictures He picks one
up Three marines pose with their gear It’s Nick Lue
Andy This means nothing to Derrick He has no idea He
puts it down

Derrick recognizes the next picture One that he brought
over It is of him and his family He slides it over

The next picture grabs his attention He picks it up It is
a picture of Rachael Cole Jennifer and him Red lines
drawn across their faces He didn’t put that there

Derrick’s eyes widen in fright This is as real as it gets

DERRICK
What the Fu

CREEEEEEAK He drops the picture then places two hands on
the gun Where in the hell did that come from He looks
into the house What he can see if it

Slowly he inches through the room towards a dark hallway
Every sense on high alert

Headlights from a passing car brighten the hallway for a
second Derrick turns and again watches the tail lights
fade in the dark

He cocks the gun Now he’s ready He looks to his left A
Pitch Dark room Nothing’s thereturns to his right
Moonlight from the kitchen shinesopen room doorsnothing
like he imagined

Rachael might be in here He inches his way around the
corner and down the hallway

IN THE HALLWAY

Derrick listenswatches for anything Leaving little to
no detection with every step

Two small specs of light grow larger behind him
Headlights from a car rounding the street
Derrick turns to peak at each room as he passes
Suddenly the headlights brighten the room

A SHADOW stands in the room behind him THE FIGURE
Derrick remains focused on what’s in front

The light dissipates So does the shadow
The Figure walks out into an adjacent room

Derrick stops To his right the kitchen He senses
something

He swings around searching with his eyes Only the light
that shines through the front door

He turns back and continues to inch alongsneaking a look
as he passes each room

DERRICK
(whisper )
Rachael
Finally at the end of the hall He stands In front of a
closed door The only closed door in the hall Must mean
something

Derrick ready’s himself adjusts his grip on the
gunpalms the door knob then swings the door open

An empty basement Derrick pokes his head down Nothing but
a dirt floor and a workbench

DERRICK
(whisper )
Rachael

He waits No one’s down there She’s gotta be here
somewhere

He turns around and walks back down the hallway Careful
Not to make a sound

In front of him an open door to his right No biggie
Suddenly The Figure walks out
Derrick aims the gun

DERRICK
Oh Shh

The Figure grabs the barrel and pushes it away from his
face

POW A shot fires

The Figure grabs Derrick by the face then walks him
backward

BAM He rams the back of Derrick’s head into the wall
BAM Derrick attempts to lift the gun

BAM BAM Derrick drops the gun He’s out Cold

INT BASEMENT — LATE NIGHT

Derrick’s POV

Blurred The room slightly spins as he attempts to awake
The Figure walks in front of Derrick to the work bench

Derrick black’s out

He wakes up again Vision still blurred This time The
Figure stares back at him Face to face Unmasked Scruffy
Pitch black eyes No white in them No good in him

Derrick looks away He notices his gun on the work bench
Its parts anyhow The Figure has dismantled it into its
individual pieces

He turns back to The Figure who is putting on his mask

DERRICK
Why are you doing this

The Figure stands up and walks over to the work bench A
pitchfork the same one used on Rachael leans on it

Chains dangle above him

Derrick sits tied to a chair in the middle of the
basement Fully conscious now Terrified He yells

DERRICK
Why are you doing this

Derrick looks at the window It’s almost morning He jerks
at the chains that tie him to the chair They don’t budge

The Figure stands over the work bench looking down at the
chessboard He moves pieces around Seemingly strategizing
his next deadly move

Derrick shakes at the chains much harder The chains move a
little He twists his wrists back and forth The tightness
of the chains causes them to bleed

Derrick talks through the pain

DERRICK
Look I’m sorry Whatever I did
I’m sorry You don’t want to do
this

The Figure makes no attempt to acknowledge him It’s as if
he’s talking to a brick wall Derrick’s voice starts to
tremble

DERRICK (CONTD)
I’m sorryplease

Derrick holds his head down He knows the minimal chance he
has He continues to twist his wrists Now dripping blood

DERRICK
Your son was a great man

The Figure stops moving Apparently listening
Derrick continues

DERRICK(CONT’D)
I wish you could have seen him
How he turned out He tried so
hard to keep the same thing from
happening to me I never knew my
mother All I knew was Grace And
you were part of the past he
wanted to forget But wanted back
so bad

Derrick looks up

DERRICK(CONT’D)

I know you were young Confused I
think that’s why he forgave you
and never gave up on you Truth be
told he had to understand it
Because the same thing happened to
him At the same age

(grimacing)
I was born

A beat Derrick sniffles then holds his head down It’s
over He excepts his fate

The Figure looks at a knife on the work bench It sits next
to the chess board He looks at the chess pieces and

Grabs the knife headed for Derrick He holds it across his
body to swing throughbut Derrick blocks the swing with
his right hand His left hand and feet still tied The
Figure swings againmisses

Derrick has tossed himself on the ground Aggressively
squirming Trying to worm his way out Dust fills the air

The Figure reaches over Derrick turns the back of the
chair to hit his arm His feet come free The Figure raises
the knife Derrick turns around and

Swings his left hand still attached to the chair striking
The Figure’s knife hand Derrick swings his arm again
Hitting The Figure’s body The chair cracks a little

Derrick swings again and again Jerking his hand with each
swing The Figure falls back with each blow Finallyhis
arm is free

Derrick turns and bolts for the door The Figure grabs the
knife and dashes after him

Derrick barely makes it up the steps whenThe Figure
lunges and slashes Derrick’s calf muscle He screams

DERRICK
Aaahhhhhhh

Derrick kicks at The Figure The knife drops He kicks
again The Figure stumbles Derrick turns up for the stairs
when his progress abruptly stops

The Figure has his leg He pulls Derrick down Derrick’s
face smacks each step then the ground

The Figure pulls him away from steps

DERRICK
Aaahhhhhh

Derrick writhes on the ground in pain
The Figure picks up the knife

Derrick sees him coming andkicks The Figure in the
balls

The Figure stumbles back This barely takes the breath out
of him He quickly gathers himselflooks down

Derrick sees it had little affect His eyes widen This is
no ordinary man Derrick begins to crawl backward The
Figure looks up at hincalculating

Derrick glances over The pitchfork

The Figure observes Derrick’s retreat He’s got him right
where he wants him He slowly walks towards Derrick

Derrick stops In line with the pitchfork
The Figure steps

Derrick rushes over to the pitchfork The Figure quickly
raises the knife with a running start then

His arm gets caught in the chains hanging from the ceiling
He jerks to free himself

Derrick’s face braced for impact rapidly recovers He
realizes what’s happened

He immediately grabs the pitchfork The Figure frees
himself

JAM Derrick thrusts the pitchfork into the abdomen of The
Figure and walks him backwards

The Figure swings the knife at Derrick head But it doesn’t
reach Derrick is too far on the pitchfork

Derrick thrusts it deeper as they walk back The Figure
continues to swing desperately

The Figure’s back slams into the wall Derrick knocks the
knife out his handsyanks the pitchfork outThe Figure
lunges forward as a final attempt

JAM Derrick plunges the pitchfork through The Figures neck
and into the wall

Derrick screams

DERRICK
SON OF BITCHHHHHH

The Figure twitchesgrabbing at the pitchforkblood
spews out from under the mask He’s too weak to pull it
out

The Figure slowly stops moving until nothing No
movement He’s dead

Derrick watches as The Figure’s body goes limp He breathes
heavy Adrenaline still running high Unremorseful at the
fact that he just killed his grandfather

DERRICK (CONTD)
Checkmate you son of a bitch

A beat Derrick catches his breath He realizes this is as
unthreatened of The Figure he could be It’s still just a
man under that mask

He reaches to pull the mask off but accidently knocks The
Figures hand off the pitchfork

Derrick pulls his hand back He’s not worth it No need to
see his face Derrick takes a deep breath then wipes his
face

While gathering his bearings Derrick turns and notices
some materials on the ground in the cornera cell phone
he recognizes those contents

He slowly walks over to them It becomes clearer He starts
to tear up That’s Rachael’s cell phone

He kneels down and picks up the wallet A picture wallet
The first picture Rachael and Derrick Together Smiling

Derrick can’t hold his emotions in now He starts crying
He flips through a few more pictures Yup that’s Rachael’s
wallet alright And those are the contents from her purse
The room is more lit now from the arising morning sun A
small window in a door behind Derrick reflects the light
of day The night is over

He holds the pictures to his chest and continues to cry
SCENE STARTS TO FADE WHEN

BOOM Out of nowhere the door behind Derrick slams open

He doesn’t have time to turn around all the way
Another masked figure VIOLENTLY attacks him

Derrick attempts to fight back He has no chance
BLACK OUT
