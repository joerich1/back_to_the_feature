TROPICAL AIRFIELD Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a
cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and
chains is hustled aboard a plane

2ND NEWSCASTER
Security was tight today at Escalon
airport in the Republic of Val Verde
where government authorities escorted
General Ramon Esperanza to the
military transport that will bring
him to the United States to stand
trial for narcotics trafficking
A HAND thrusts in front of the CAMERA - FINGERS clenching

and

curling oddly

A half naked MAN is doing Tai Chi EXERCISES This is
COLONEL

troops in

the field and then moving to a table under a tarp to sign

documents with American military officers He hands a

NEWSCASTER
Only two years ago the controversial
General lead his countrys Army in
its campaign against Communists
insurgents - a campaign fought with
American money and advisors
Esperanzas fall from power caused

ripples not only in his countrys

recent election but closer to home
