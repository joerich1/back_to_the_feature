SIDNEY

No its me Billy I need time Im

Sidney starts to walk away but turns back angry

SIDNEY
Im glad to know youre coping so well
with life Billy But some of us arent so
perfect Some of us are just trying to
hold on

Sidney disappears through a door marked GIRLS BATHROOM leaving
Billy alone in the hallway He SMACKS his forehead pissed at
himself

INT GIRLS BATHROOM
Large and spacious Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a

row of sinks and a huge mirror Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle
and talk--each from their respective stalls
GIRL 1
She was never attacked I think she made

it all up
GIRL 2
Why would she lie about it
GIRL 1
For attention The girl has some serious

issues
Sidney listens intently

A toilet FLUSHES Sidney quickly jumps in a stall hiding just
as GIRL 1 appears from a stall She looks like that voice--a
snotty little twit

GIRL 1
What if she did it What if Sidney
killed Casey and Steve

GIRL 2
And why would she do that

GIRL 1
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed
them both in a jealous rage

Another toilet FLUSHES

GIRL 2
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy

GIRL 1
Maybe shes a slut just like her mom

INSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens Her face weakening

GIRL 2
Youre evil

GIRL 1
Please its common knowledge Her
mother was a trollop

GIRL 2 appears from her stall--another twit They both stand in
front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces

GIRL 2
Cut some slack She watched her mom get
butchered
GIRL 1
And it fucked her up royally Think
about it It makes perfect sense Her
moms death leaves her distraught and
hostile at a cruel and inhumane world
shes disillusioned wheres God etc
Completely suicidal And one day she
snaps She wants to kill herself but
realizes teen suicide is out this year
And homicide is a much healthier
therapeutic expression

From the stall Sidney listens her heart pounding jaw quivering

GIRL 2
Where do you get this shit

GIRL 1
Ricki Lake

The two girls exit Sidney moves out of the stall catching her
reflection in the mirror

SIDNEY
Pathetic

Water DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from
the cracked transom above the bathroom door It sound almost like
a whisper Siddneey

Sidney spins around What the She checks out the bathroom
The doors to the stalls are all closed She bends down and scans
beneath them looking for feet No one Nothing

Sidney turns back to the mirror Suddenly

MAN
(oc whisper)
Siddneey

Unmistakable this time The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail
through the eye It comes from one of the stalls She stands
thunderstruck eyeing the stalls thru the mirror

SIDNEY
Is someone there

A long morose silence And then

MAN
(softly simply)
Its me Sidney

Sidney spins around Fuck no HES HERE Terror floods her
face She eyes the exit door then the row of stalls she must
pass to get to it

She checks under the stalls again Nothingwhere the fuck is
he She takes a step forward when

TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall
Sidneys face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open
She bolts forward making a break for itbut slips on the wet
floorher feet flying out from under

Sidney reaches outgrabs hold of a sinksaves herself from
fallingshe glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her
A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit
doornarrowly escaping

The CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS
standing at attention Mr Himbry rips the mask off of one of the
students heads

MR HIMBRY
Two students have been savagely murdered
And this is how we express our compassion
and sensivity

He rips the mask off the other student

MR HIMBRY
We throw on a mask and dance around
campus just hoping someone else gets
butchered before we get bored again
Youre both expelled
The GHOSTS doth protest

GHOST 1
Aw come on Mr Himbry it was just a
joke

GHOST 2

Yeah thats not fair

A deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr Himbrys face Neither
student budges scared to even breathe

MR HIMBRY
No its not fair Fairness would be to
rip your insides out and hang you from
a tree so you can be exposed for the
desensitized heartless little shits that
you are

Suddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears hysterical

Sidney collapses in his arms
EXT SCHOOL STREET - MINUTES LATER

GALE
Twenty-five huh In a demographic study

males 11-24 I just missed you Of course

in the upper torso area Does the force
require that you work out

Dewey looks away blushing a bit

DEWEY
No maam Because of my boyish good
looks muscle mass has increased my
acceptance as a serious police officer

They approach the schools front entrance Suddenly Mr Himbrys
VOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA
system They stop to listen
MR HIMBRY

(via PA)

Dewey realizing hes said too much clams up

DEWEY

Dewey starts up the schools front steps as the bell RINGS

He turns to her earnestly as STUDENTS come pouring out the front
doors

DEWEY

GALE

She smiles deliciously gives him a wink then struts off as
Dewey like a nervous little school boy watches her go

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

School is clearing out The halls have begun to empty as Tatum
escorts Sidney down the hallway

TATUM
It was just some sick fuck having a
laugh

SIDNEY

It was him Tatum I know it
Tatum wants to believe her but

TATUM

Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited

STU
Remember theres safety in numbers

SIDNEY
(giving in)

STU

Stu speeds off sliding down the empty hallway
INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - LATER

Mr Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before
him He picks one of them up snickering

MR HIMBRY
Damn

He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door He
pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door He tries
the mask on pulling it over his face looking in the mirror
when

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him He rips the mask off his head
turns to his office door and opens it to reveal

AN EMPTY DOORWAY He pokes his head into the outer office area
and looks around But no ones there

MR HIMBRY
Yes Hello

The place is empty A little suspicious he closes the door
catching his reflection in the closet mirror He looks at the
mask in his hands Jesus even hes jumpy Two seconds later

ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR Himbry grabs the door quickly this
time throwing it open Again no ones there He steps out into
the outer office determined to catch a prankster

INT OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Completely empty Mr Himbry moves through the outer office and
into the school corridor The overhead lights have been turned

off and the corridor is now dark and deserted He looks up and

down the hall Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a
broom

MR HIMBRY
Little shits

Mr Himbry returns to his office
INT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Himbry reenters his office moving to his desk when he spots the
closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT

This gives him a pause-he had left it open Hadnt he Suddenly
he cant remember He shifts uneasy reaching for the door knob
pulling the door open to reveal

AN EMPTY CLOSET He stands still a moment suddenly realizing
someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door
Nervously he pushes it shut to reveal

NOTHING Himbry shakes away his jitters realizing hes spooked
himself He continues to his desk pushing his office door shut

when

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind itknife in hand
Quick and easy Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes
down The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him

EXT TATUMS HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER
The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing

Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the
small town neighborhood Deweys patrol jeep is parked in the
driveway

Despite loud music BLARING from an inside stereo this is a quiet
moment

TATUM
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth
Maybe he was having an affair with your
mom

SIDNEY
So you think my mom was a slut too

TATUM
I didnt say that Sid But you know
there were rumors Your dad was
always out of town on business
Maybe your mom was a very unhappy
woman

SIDNEY
If they were having an affair how come
that Cotton couldnt prove it in court

TATUM
You cant prove a rumor Thats why its
a rumor

SIDNEY
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale
Weathers

TATUM
(delicately)
It goes further back Sid Theres been
talk about other men

SIDNEY
And you believe it

TATUM
Wellyou can only hear that Richard
Gere-gerbil story so many times before
you have to start believing it

A long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this She stands up
and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the
neighborhood

SIDNEY
If I was wrong Cotton then hes still
out there

TATUM
Dont go there Sid Youre starting to
sound like some Wes Carpenter flick
Dont freak yourself out--weve got a
long night ahead of us

SIDNEY
Youre right Im cracking up Ignore
me

TATUM

Come on lets rock

Sid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE that stands across the street under a tree His presence
so subtle and unobtrusive youd have to see this movie a second
time to know he was there all along

EXT MAIN STREET - LATER

Stu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next
to him

BILLY
Howd you do

STU
Piece of cake Shell be there

BILLY
Thanks butt wart You did good

STU
So you gonna try and make up with Sid

BILLY
Duhthats quick

STU
I was just asking Why are you always at
me
BILLY
Because Im trying to build your self-
esteem Youre far too sensitive

sTU
Oh

Billy thumbs Stus forehead

BILLY
You ready to party hard tonight

STU
You know it

They come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main
Street A huge blue monstrosity thats bigger than the local
bank and post office combined The sign in front reads
BLOCKBUSTER

INT BLOCKBUSTER - CONTINUOUS

You typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded Randy in his
Blockbuster get up is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears-—
knocking the videos out of his hand

STU
Jesus this place is packed

RANDY
(picking up videos)
We had a run in the mass murder section

STU
You coming tonight

RANDY
Yeah Im off early--curfew you know
(looking off)
Now thats poor taste

STU
What

Randy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to TWO
GIRLS (The twits from the bathroom perhaps)

RANDY
If you were the only suspect in a
senseless bloodbath would you be standing
in the horror section
STU
It was all a misunderstanding He didnt
do anything

RANDY
Youre such a little lap dog Hes got
killer printed all over his forehead

STU
The whyd the police let him go

RANDY
Because obviously they dont watch
enough movies This is standard horror
movie stuff PROM NIGHT revisited

Randy moves down the aisle reshelving videos

STU
Why would he want to kill his own
girlfriend

RANDY
Theres always some stupid bullshit
reason to kill your girlfriend Thats
the beauty of it all Simplicity
Besides if its too complicated you lose
your target audience

STU
So whats his reason

RANDY
Maybe Sidney wouldnt have sex with him

STU
Shes saving herself for you

RANDY
Could be Now that Billys tried to
mutilate her you think Sid would go out
with me

STU
I think her father did it How come they
cant find his ass

RANDY
Because hes probably dead His body
will come popping out in the last reel
somewhereeyes gauged See the police
are always off track with this shit if theyd
watch PROM NIGHT theyd save time
Theres formula to it A very simple one
Everyones always a suspect--the father
the principal the town derelict

STU
Which is you

RANDY

So while theyre off investigating a dead
end Billy whos been written off as a
suspect is busy planning his next
hunting expedition

BILLY
(oc)
How do we know youre not the killer

Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him Busted

RANDY
Uhhi Billy

BILLY
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button

Randy shrugs laughing it off

RANDY
Youre absolutely right Im the first
to admit it If this were a scary movie
Id be the prime suspect

STU
And what would be your motive

RANDY
Its 1995--motives are incidental

EXT MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER

Deweys patrol jeep makes its way down mainstreet Its almost
dark The street is close to deserted

INT PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS

Deweys behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum
while Sid stares out the window

DEWEY

TATUM

little blow out--well be perfectly safe

Sid stares out the window CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts a
few people rush to their car in a hurry to beat curfew

SIDNEY

DEWEY

TATUM

DEWEY

SIDNEY

cast Tori Spelling

EXT PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS

They pile out of the jeep Dewey heads for the station

DEWEY

street

SIDNEY

TATUM
He better not be I told Stu to keep his
mouth shut I think we can live without
EVERYBODYS ALL AMERICAN for

They approach the grocery store Small and simple Sid and Tatum
grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store pushing the
cart through two sliding glass doors

A lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter big and frumpy looks up
from counting money

CHECK OUT LADY
You girls gonna have to hurry it up
Were under curfew

TATUM
Two minutes tops

They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the
automated doors slide shut behind them and a

GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears out of nowhere standing just
outside watching quietly through the glass store windows

EXT POLICE STATION - SHERIFFS OFFICE

Sheriff Burkes face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in

INT SUPERMARKET - FEW MINUTES LATER

Sidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section The
store is completely empty The girls gab freely

SIDNEY
Billys right Whenever he touches me I
just cant relax

TATUM
You have a few intimacy issues as a
result of your mothers untimely death
Its no big deal Youll thaw out

SIDNEY
But hes been so patient with me Tatum
You know with all the sex stuff How
many guys would put up with a girlfriend
whos sexually anorexic

TATUM
Billy and his penis dont deserve you

Sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf Down the aisle
through the storefront window the GHOST MASKED FIGURE still stands
watching their every move

EXT SUPERMARKET

Sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it
The GHOST MASKED FIGURE is nowhere to be found

SIDNEY
What do you think about when youre
having sex

TATUM
With Stu theres little time to stop and
reflect But sometimes before to relax
and get in the mood I think about Grant
Goodeve

Sid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street

SIDNEY
Who

TATUM
Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on
EIGHT IS ENOUGH Remember that show He
was the one who lived off alone He would come
around every now and then with his guitar and
sing Eight is enough to fill our lives with love
He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot
brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE God I
was in love with Grant he was so hot The show
came on every day after school right during my
puberty years Grant Goodeve was very instrumental
in my maturing as a woman

SIDNEY
How does that get you in the mood with
Stu

TATUM

During foreplay I sing the theme song to
myself Eight is enough to fill our lives
with love Its a real turn on

SIDNEY
No way

TATUM
Grant wrote the song himself Im
convinced the lyrics had a secret
meaning Eight is enough

Sid pushes the cart up to Deweys jeep Tatum hops off

SIDNEY
What secret meaning Like a Satanical
thing

TATUM

Watch the show Sid His basket is
bigger than the one youre pushing

SIDNEY
TATUM

TATUM
Oh Sidney WHAT A guy can talk tits
til hes dead but the minute you mention
an eight inch weenie Watch out

Sidney stops just short of a laugh Tatum pulls the back jeep
door loading the groceries in Behind her the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE appears just out of their sight behind the jeeps open
back door

TATUM
Theres that sense of humor I knew it

DEWEY

Tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way blindly It rolls
down the road by itself gaining speed on a decline running smack
into the GHOST MASKED FIGURE who stops the cart cold with one
hand

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Deweys jeep makes its way down a long winding road Headlights
illuminate the thick woods that line each side Following behind
them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan

Dewey comes to the end of the road It dead ends at

no neighbors in sight A huge old home just ripe for a night of

INT KITCHEN

Tatum is alone in the kitchen She empties popcorn into a bowl
then pulls open the refrigeratorlooks quickly then
remembers

She moves through the adjoining laundry room to the

INT GARAGE

The kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage
Tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch

She finds a button and hits it BRRRRMMM The electric garage
door starts to rise Wrong switch She hits it again and it
closes

She finds another switch CLICK A small lightbulb overhead
comes on barely lighting the large two car garage leaving
pockets of shadows along the wall

Tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it
not seeing the kitchen door quietly slowly closing behind her

sealing her off from the rest of the house

Tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open Its light
casts a glow across her face

CRASH-BOOM
Tatum jumps spinning around just in time to see a cat escape
through a large pet door thats built into the garage door She

smiles at her jumpiness

Tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads
back to the kitchen

At the kitchen door she juggles the beer reaching for the knob
Its locked

TATUM
SHIT

She KICKS it with her foot several times

TATUM
Hey Shitheads

A moment No answer

TATUM
OH SHIT PISS

Tatum leans over and with her elbow hits the garage door button
BRRRMM It begins to rise

She moves towards the rising door beer in hand Suddenly CRR-
BRRRM The garage door RESETS reversing direction moving down
closing

TATUM

Tatum spins around to see
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE

Silhouetted in the dark next to the kitchen door his hand on the
switch Tatum at once GASPS taken back but then relaxes

TATUM
Is that you Randy Cute

The FIGURE stares at her blankly
TATUM
And what movie is this from I SPIT ON
YOUR GARAGE
Tatum takes a step towards the FIGURE
TATUM
Lose the mask If Sidney sees it shell

The FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side

TATUM
Oh you wanna play psycho killer
The FIGURE slowly nods

TATUM
Can I be the helpless victim

The FIGURE slowly nods again

TATUM
Okay lets see No please dont kill
me Mr Ghostface I want to be in the
sequel

Tatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE but he steps too
blocking her

TATUM
Cut Casper Thats a wrap

Tatum moves again sidestepping the FIGURE but hes faster and
cuts her off

Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with
the other pushes the FIGURE hard knocking him aside

TATUM
Randy--will you stop

But as the FIGURE intercepts lunging forward grabbing her wrist
hard Tatum stumblesbeer cans hit the floor spewing

TATUM
You little shit

Tatum yanks hard releasing his hold when a flash of silver
catches her eye She looks down glimpsing a long sharp blade as
it darts forward cutting into her forearm

Tatum pulls back horrified as the moment turns deadly serious

The FIGURE advances on her--knife out ready She staggers
backwards holding her bloody arm backing into the refrigerator
SCREAMING

TATUM
Who are you

The FIGURE lashes out with the knife Tatum dodges it leaping
back against the fridge The FIGURE advances Instinctively she
rips the top freezer door open BASHING the FIGURE in the face
sending him backwards reeling

Tatum bolts to theCLOSED GARAGE DOOR In a panic she BEATS
and PULLS
on it trying to make it lift She eyes the FIGUREhes
recovering

She goes for the pet door dropping to the floor diving for
itshe wedges her upper body through her head shoulders torso
just as the

FIGURE pounces grabbing hold of her feet Tatum goes crazy
SCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through

EXT GARAGE DOOR

Tatum is half inhalf out of the pet door She BEATS and JERKS
wildly unable to see the FIGURE on the other side

A true fighter Tatum kicks hard making direct contact with the
FIGURE knocking him away

She takes the moment to pull herself through furtherbut she
stopsstuck She pulls and tugs but cant move She listens
but hears nothing Where did he go An agonizing silence And
then

CRR-BRRRM The garage door is activated It begins to rise
upward taking
Tatum with it She SCREAMS MADLY

TATUM
NOOOOOOOO

Tatums arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free
herself from the door but it moves too fast carrying her up

She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage
rafters just as her neck hits the first beam SNAPPING instantly

INT FOYER - MINUTES LATER

He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his
facetasting it

BILLY

Sidney is dumbfounded Slowly she takes a step back moving into
the dark refines of the kitchen

Billy lurches forward in a fake-out baiting her She takes
another step back--petrified

CLOSE ON BILLYS FACE It is no longer familiar to Sidney There
is something inhuman now about his features His expression is
pure evil

She takes another step back shrinking into the dark kitchen

THE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline
of a FIGURE appears

STANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY

She continues to back up moving right into the arms of
STU

Sidney spins aroundher mouth open in speechless horror

SIDNEY

Stu stares back at her eyes wide lips curled in a subtle smile
as he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face

STU
(whispering into phone)

His VOICE sounds affected nowthe VOICE of the killer

Sidney looks back to Billy then to Stu then to Billy again It
becomes all too clear

She stands between them her mind racing calculating
SHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM

If for no other reason than to put space between her and
themthey stand in the entryway trapping her in

BILLY
Where ya going Its not over yet Weve

A NOISE comes from the kitchen A low dragging sound Stu
reappears from the front hallwrestling with

somethingsomeone

CLOSE ON STUhe has a body in tow he thrusts it forward and it
rolls into the living room Sidney looks down to find

HER FATHER
bound and gagged His eyes wide in fear very much alive

SIDNEY

Stu places the cellular phone in Mr Prescotts shirt pocket

STU

BILLY
Its an easy game We ask youa
question If you get it wrong--you die

STU

SIDNEY
Youre crazy--both of you

STU
The official term is psychotic

SIDNEY
Youll never get away with this

BILLY
Tell that to Cotton Weary You wouldnt
believe how easy it was to frame him

STU
Yeah we just watched a few movies Took
a few notes It was fun
Billy and Stu relish their madness proud of themselves

Sidney looks to her dad sees the tears in his eyes She looks
back to Billy unflinchinga determined look on her face

SIDNEY
Why did you kill my mother

BILLY
Why WHY Did you hear that Stu I
think she wants a motive HmmmI dont
really believe in motives Sid I mean did
Norman Bates have a motive

Stu plays along shaking his head

STU
Nope

BILLY
And did they really ever explain why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people
Dont think so You see its scarier
when theres no motive Sid

SIDNEY
(fighting tears)
I dont understand

BILLY
We did your mom a favor Sid The woman
was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit
all over town like she was Sharon Stone or
something

STU
(laughing)
SO we put her out of her misery I
mean lets face it your mom was no
Sharon Stone

Stu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious

BILLY
Is that motive enough for you Or how
about this Did you know your slut
mother was sleeping with my dad and shes
the reason my mom moved out and deserted
me

A sudden silence Sidney is rigid with shock his words resonant
with truth

SIDNEY
What

Even Stu is surprised with his seriousness

BILLY
Think about it On the off chance I get
caught-a motive like that could divide a
jury for years dont you think You took
my mother so I took yours Big sympathy
factor Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behavior It certainly
fucked you up It made you have sex with
a psychopath

STU
Thats right and now that youre no
longer a virgin You gotta die--those
are the rules

Billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer And then
moves to Sidney with the butcher knife in hand

BILLY
Pretend this is all just a scary movie
Sid How do you think its going to end

Sidney doesnt respond

STU
(excited)
This is the best part Sid Billys got
it all figured out Why do you think we
kept your father alive so long Why did
we save you for last

BILLY

ON SIDNEY as she digs her hand into Billys open chest wound He
CRIES OUT BLOODY MURDER Her other hand brings the gun up to his
facebut he head bunts it out the front doorsuddenly a flash
of silver appears above Sidney

Billy has grasped the butcher knifehe rises it high above
Sidney ready to strikewhen a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER
striking Billy knocking him back into the living room

Sidney looks up to see

GALE WEATHERS holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises
above the guns chamber

Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her helping her Their eyes
meet A life truce

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Billy and Stu lay face up head to head Sid and Gale move over
them staring down Randy joins them

RANDY
Sid you found me outIm a virgin
And pretty happy about it right now

Sidney nudges their bodies They both stir

RANDY
Careful This is the moment when you
think the killers dead but then he
springs back to life for one last scare

Sidney grabs the gun from Gale

SIDNEY
Not this time
She positions her foot on Stus chest and aims

SIDNEY
This is for my Mom asshole

She SHOOTS him in the forehead a clean and perfect shot The she
aims the barrel at Billy whos eyes suddenly open blinking up at
her blood bubbling from his lips Hes not yet dead Their eyes
lock

SIDNEY
And this Billy stud-bucket is for having
an incredibly small weenie

She FIRES another perfect shot Theyre both goners

Sidney drops the smoking gun standing silent over the bodies A
quiet moment when suddenly

A FIGURE LUNGES AT THEM

Both Sid and Gale and Randy SCREAM in epic final scare
proportions as Mr Prescott leaps forward still bound and gagged

Sid catches her breath relaxing

SIDNEY
Oh Daddy

She rushes to him untying himwhile Gale moves to the bookcase
and retrieves the hidden camera

GALE
I wanna close-up

Randy appears by Sidneys side helping her untie her father

RANDY
This is probably an inappropriate
moment but you think youd want
to maybe go out with me sometime
like on a date

Sidney looks at him dumbfounded

RANDY
Maybe catch a movie

A long moment as Sidneys face goes from disbelief to resignation
to the slight trace of a smile
SIDNEY
Only if its a nice Meg Ryan movie

RANDY
You got it

He smiles at herwatching as Sidney grabs hold of her father

holding him tight as Gale Weathers with camera in hand gets one
hell of an ending to this SCARY MOVIE

THE END
