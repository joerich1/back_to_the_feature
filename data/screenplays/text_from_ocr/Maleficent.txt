MALEFICENT

EXT THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY 1

We are flying above the moors of northern Scotland following
the rugged rolling terrain at bird-height

ANGLE ON WINGS

Our shining BLACK WINGS rise and fall lazily as we ride the
strong air currents We drop down a steep stole and level
out to skim the blue water of an expansive loch below We
wing our way above farmlands beyond

EXT A FARM — DAY 2

We pass above a FARM WOMAN below She pours MILK from a jug
onto a large STONE

FARM WOMAN
For the Fair Folk

We approach another farm house

EXT THE HOUSE OF A SHEPHERD - DAY 3

Two collies lay outside the house They leap up as the
SHEPHERD comes out with his YOUNG SON and WIFE The Shepherd
and his boy walk toward the paddock But they stop dismayed
to see that the paddock gate is wide open The sheep are
scattered across the wide field

SHEPHERD
The Pixies have been at it again

He WHISTLES The dogs race across the field to round up the
sheep The boy runs to help His wife goes back inside and

returns with a heavy iron pan She mutters an old adage as

she positions the pan above the door

SHEPHERD’S WIFE
Iron pot above the door Protect
our home from dark ones of the
moor
ON THE SHEPHERD AND SON
They herd the sheep down the road

Ahead it crosses a thin line of DARK GRASS which runs
through the lighter grass of the field

Fe HF
SHEPHERD
Hold up

He takes off one of his work GLOVES and tosses it onto the
road in the spot where it meets the line of dark grass

SHEPHERD
Drop a glove before you cross a
faerie path They don’t like it if
we don’t show respect

He whistles to the dogs

They nip at the sheep who trample the GLOVE as they run The
boy picks it up and runs to catch up

EXT THE MOORS - FROM ABOVE - ON THE WING 4

WE TURN and follow the FAERIE PATH which leads into wilder
MOORS with peat bogs heath meadows thin forests streams
and misty mountains in the distance

EXT A BLACKTHORN TREE - DAY 5

WE alight on the branch of a Blackthorn tree and TRAVEL down
to reveal that WE are not a winged bird

--but a WINGED GIRL

MALEFICENT is lean all angles with high cheekbones a
sharp chin and pointed ears She looks about 15 She
struggles with her LARGE WINGS like wild unruly hair before
she gets them to fold behind her

ON THE MOORLANDS - MALEFICENT’S POV

The natural sounds of the MOORS drift up to her The sounds
gradually become discernible as VOICES talking laughing
complaining threatening whining

THE BLACKTHORN TREE - ON MALEFICENT

She takes a few BLACK NUTS from the tree and CRUNCHES them
shell and all GUTTERAL GRUNTING sounds from below draw her
gaze

ON THE PEAT BOG - HER POV

MUD-COVERED CREATURES with round bodies and spindly arms and

legs move about in the bog As they grunt and slobber mud
drips from their mouths which sustains and thickens the bog
THE BLACKTHORN TREE - ON MALEFICENT

Several WINGLESS WIZENED BALD ELVISH MEN burst from the
branches slapping her hands away from their nuts

She makes an ugly face back at them She grabs more nuts and
flies off following a ROCKY STREAM

EXT A POND - DAY 6

Maleficent lands on the bank and sits on a rock to finish
her stolen black nuts

Pretty female WATER FAERIES admire their reflections Their
LONG GREEN HAIR is made of silky trailing weeds

Nearby shy timid MOSS PEOPLE with large eyes lurk in the
dark wood foliage As they run their hands over the dried
dead moss it turns GREEN once again

A LONG GREEN ARM emerges from the water and reaches out
toward Maleficent’s bare ankle She looks down just as the
GREEN HAND grabs her ankle and jerks her off the rock A
MALEVOLENT WATER WOMAN with knotted weeds and pebbles for
hair pulls her toward the pond

MALEFICENT
Let go

Maleficent kicks her away and flies off

The GREEN WOMAN slips back into the water Maleficent flies
toward a copse of tall trees ahead

EXT A ROWAN TREE - DAY 7
She lights in the branches of a tree to eat her black nuts
in peace Loud giggling LAUGHTER draws her attention

EXT A MEADOW - DAY 8
Three FLOWER PIXIES play hide-and-seek in the meadow
KNOTGRASS THISTLEWIT and FLITTLE are small lithe flighty
girls with pointed ears noses and tiny transparent wings

FLITTLE wears all blue She’s plagued with ever-present
butterflies that fly around her head

THISTLEWIT has a tiny round head with tufts of wispy hair
that splay outward around her face like a dandelion
KNOTGRASS wears green and brown

Her short dark hair sticks upright or falls down into her
eyes Color flows from the Pixies fingertips making the
petals brighter the grass greener or sagging flowers
revive

They hear BELLS in the sky and rise into the air

EXT THE ROWAN TREE - DAY 9
The Pixies fly past Maleficent in the tree

FLITTLE
The King and Queen are coming

They flit away Maleficent rolls her eyes
MALEFICENT

Gnats
EXT THE SKY - THE FAERIE PROCESSION 10
The sky is crowded with winged faeries The beautiful QUEEN
ULLA and her husband KING KINLOCH lead the procession which
is lit by the wavering lights of WILL O’ THE WISP
ON THE MOORS - FROM ABOVE
Below wingless FAERIES emerge Small ELVISH MEN with feet
of crows and tiny eyes Creatures with the bodies of small
HORSES and the heads of HUMANS Web-footed SPRITES with huge
sharp teeth and pointed ears WILD ELVISH WOMEN lurking at
the base of Trees

EXT THE FAERIE FLIGHT - EVENING 11

Maleficent flies up to join the procession She soars up to
a higher altitude above the Royals

Queen Ulla glares up at her

The PIXIES fly up beneath Maleficent

KNOTGRASS
Come down
THISTLEWIT
You’re not allowed to fly above the

Queen

This only makes Maleficent fly even higher

ON MALEFICENT
She soars high up bursting through the clouds

Then she folds her wings and plummets straight down again
through the crowded procession Faeries flutter out of her
way She falls almost to the ground before her wings open
and she soars up again

King Kinloch and Queen Ulla are not pleased

KINLOCH
We have to do something about her

EXT THE FAERIE MOUND - EVENING 12
The procession approaches a large grassy HILLOCK

The King and Queen land on the mound followed by the others
The Faeries are all the size of SMALL HUMANS with delicate
pointed ears and tiny refined features

Ulla steps onto A LOW FLAT STONE which leads to her throne
like a stepping stone As she steps up on it the STONE
emits a CONTENTED PURR

The King sits on his throne next to hers

A back-wind stirs the air briskly as Maleficent lands on the
mound among the faeries She stands head and shoulders above
them Her WINGS loom above her head She seems like a large
untamed BAT among finches

KINLOCH
Fold your wings

The Faeries fold their tiny wings Maleficent has trouble
getting hers to obey The three Pixies smirk and giggle

ULLA
Maleficent

MALEFICENT
Yes your majesty

ULLA
Step forward

Maleficent tries to take a step but one wing is caught
under the foot of another faerie She tugs it out and steps
forward She hunches uncomfortably as all eyes turn on her
ULLA
No one flies above me

MALEFICENT
Yes your majesty

Knotgrass whispers to the other Pixies

KNOTGRASS
It’s those wings She can’t control
them

One of Maleficent’s wings lashes out and knocks Flittle
down

ULLA
Maleficent

She grabs it and pulls it in closely

ULLA
Control your wings Or you will be
punished Step back Maleficent

Maleficent steps back The others give her a wide berth

ULLA
The King and I have just returned
from a visit with the human King
Henry Like all humans he’s easily
impressed

KINLOCH
All we had to do was show hima
little magic and he showered us
with gifts

Serving faeries fly in with trays of human-made cakes milk
wine etc The faeries partake eagerly

ULLA
It’s the beginning of a beautiful
friendship

Ulla frowns to see a WINGLESS BOY about Maleficent’s age in
the crowd

ULLA
What is he doing here

Kinloch is embarrassed to see him STEFAN is the
illegitimate son of King Kinloch and a human woman
KINLOCH
I’m sorry my love
(to the Boy)
Leave the Queen’s circle boy

The boy doesn’t move

STEFAN
No sir

KINLOCH
Leave the circle

STEFAN
I have a right to be here

ULLA
You have no rights at all
halfling You have no magic You
have no wings

MALEFICENT
But he’s the King’s son

Ulla gasps The faeries go silent
Kinloch chokes out the words

KINLOCH
Ihave no sons

MALEFICENT
You don’t have to pretend It’s no
secret Everyone knows that

ULLA
Maleficent

Ulla’s mortified at the public humiliation She fixes
Maleficent in a smoldering furious glare The three Pixies
draw away to be out of the line of fire

ULLA
Ever since that tragic night that
you were born I have tried to find
the good in you I have tried for
my sister’s sake

She breaks down briefly The King touches her hand

ULLA
But I have failed because there is
no good in you You’re a devilish
thing You were born that way

She abruptly waves her hand at Maleficent She’s STRUCK by
VIOLENT MAGIC which knocks her to her knees

ULLA
You will wear these for a hundred
years so all can see your true
nature

The magic dissipates to reveal a pair of large black HORNS
embedded in the top of Maleficent’s head The faeries draw
back in shock Maleficent slowly reaches up to feel them
Horror crosses her face

MALEFICENT
No

She tries to pull them off The faeries shock gives way to
smiles and smirks Maleficent pulls and strains

But the horns are firmly embedded The Pixies laugh

Flittle laughs so hard she sucks in one of her ever-present
butterflies and chokes Maleficent locks eyes with Stefan
briefly He looks horrified and guilty

CUT TO

EXT THE MOORS - LATER 13
Maleficent walks through a shaded grove

Her head is bowed from the weight of the horns She
approaches a pond with WATER FAERIES

Frightened by the sight of her they dive quickly into the
water She continues on Two small HUMAN-HEADED HORSES run
off when they see her coming She shrugs it off and
continues on Stefan appears out of the shadows

STEFAN
Maleficent

She abruptly turns and goes the other way He runs around to
stand in front of her

MALEFICENT
Go away

STEFAN
I want to talk to you
MALEFICENT
I don’t want to talk to you

One of her wings lashes out and knocks him to the ground

looks up at her

STEFAN
I just wanted to thank you for
standing up for me

MALEFICENT
A lot of good it did me

She sits down on a rock He gets up and sits next to her

STEFAN
I’m sorry about the

He indicates the horns

STEFAN
Queen Ulla is a tyrant

MALEFICENT
I know

They sit in silence for a moment

STEFAN
I like your wings
MALEFICENT
You do
STEFAN

I wish I had some

MALEFICENT
I don’t blame you

She holds a wing out for him to touch He hesitates

MALEFICENT
They don’t bite

He strokes the soft feathers

EXT A MEADOW - DAY 14
The Pixies gambol in the meadow
Bees and hummingbirds flit from flower to flower
Thistlewit spins around Wisps of her hair fly off like
dandelion seeds Knotgrass runs through the meadow trailing
her hand in the low grass The grass grows tall in her wake
Flittle and Thistlewit study a blue flower
THISTLEWIT

What color will you make the

blue-bells this year
Flittle just looks at her
ANOTHER PART OF THE MEADOW
Maleficent walks with Stefan

Her wings drag on the ground They flap with irritation
which causes her to fly up Stefan grabs her

STEFAN
You’re drifting

He pulls her down to the ground

MALEFICENT
They’re not happy when we walk

The Pixies see them approaching
FLITTLE
Maleficent Those horns are perfect
on you
Knotgrass steps on Maleficent’s trailing wing

She stumbles forward

STEFAN
Leave her alone

FLITTLE
Go live with humans halfling

Maleficent whirls around angrily

Her wings arch above her head

MALEFICENT
I’m a halfling too Call me a
halfling Go ahead
They shrink back from her She grabs Stefan

MALEFICENT
Never mind them

They keep walking

KNOTGRASS You killed your mother

Maleficent stops stricken by the words She looks up The
Pixies hover overhead They drop rocks and mud down on them
Maleficent uses her wings to protect Stefan

MALEFICENT
Stay here

She opens her wings The Pixies scream and fly away
Maleficent goes after them

EXT THE SKY - DAY 15
Maleficent chases the Pixies like a hawk after sparrows
They scream

EXT A POND - DAY 16
Queen Ulla and the King sit on the bank

Water Faeries perform aquatic acrobatics for them They eat
cake and drink milk from flower teacups

The three Pixies fly toward them screaming with Maleficent
right behind them The Pixies hide behind the King and
Queen But Maleficent keeps coming in a fury

ULLA
Stop right there

Ulla throws MAGIC at her Maleficent’s wings buckle and she
falls She hits the ground hard

ULLA
You see how devilish you are I
blame your father

KNOTGRASS
She deserves to wear the horns

ULLA
Yes she does
(to Maleficent)
Admit you deserve them

MALEFICENT
Why should I

ULLA
I’‘ll clip your wings if you don’t

MALEFICENT
You wouldnt

ULLA
Oh but I would

Maleficent drops her head She forces the words out
bitterly

MALEFICENT
I deserve to wear the horns

ULLA
For a hundred years

MALEFICENT
For a hundred years

ULLA
Now get out of my sight

Maleficent opens her wings to fly

ULLA
Walk
She folds them and walks away head bowed wings trailing on
the ground
17 EXT THE BLACKTHORN TREE - LATER 17

Maleficent and Stefan sit in a high branch together

MALEFICENT
I didn’t kill my mother She died
the night I was born

STEFAN
I know Everyone does Who’s your
father

MALEFICENT

The Red Cap

STEFAN
Him No wonder you’re so

She gives him a sharp look
MALEFICENT
What Wild dark strange

dangerous

STEFAN
Tall

But she knows perfectly well that’s not what he meant She
sees something off dismayed

MALEFICENT
Oh no the Rowan

ON A ROWAN TREE - HER POV
The trunk of the tree has been split by lightning

MALEFICENT
She won’t live Hold onto me

She puts her arm around his waist and leaps from the tree
Stefan’s thrilled as they fly to the ground

EXT THE ROWAN TREE - DAY 18
Maleficent stands in front of the wounded tree

She closes her eyes Sweat drips down her forehead as MAGIC
flows from her to the tree Stefan watches fascinated and
envious Gradually the split trunk mends itself But the
process took something essential from Maleficent She

collapses against the tree trunk

DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE MOORS - YEARS LATER 19
CLOSE ON THE HORNS

One large horn ringed and scarred is rubbed vigorously
against a tree trunk It falls off

We hear a GASP of surprise The other Horn is rubbed just as
vigorously It falls off

ON MALEFICENT

She’s grown into a dark mysterious beauty She rubs the
places on her head where the horns had been Stefan
approaches He’s become a handsome YOUNG MAN

STEFAN
There you are I have news

MALEFICENT
Queen Ulla dead

STEFAN
How did you know She nods at the
horns on the ground

MALEFICENT
Her spell is broken

She picks them up and throws them as far as she can

EXT THE LOCH - DUSK 20

The Fair People stand silently on the banks of the loch
watching four black swans carry the funeral bier across the
water and into the setting sun The Pixies stand on the bank
with the others Flittle and Thistlewit whisper

THISTLEWIT
Who will be Queen now

FLITTLE
No one knows She had no heirs

KNOTGRASS
The Stone knows

THISTLEWIT
What stone

KNOTGRASS
The Queen’s Stone Anyone who
wishes to be queen steps on the
Stone If she is false it growls
If she is the one true Queen it
will it roar like a lion
Understand

Thistlewit studies her face
THISTLEWIT
You have green in your eyebrows I
never noticed that before

Knotgrass looks skyward

KNOTGRASS
Why do I waste my breath

CLOSE ON THE STONE

A faerie foot lands on the Queen’s Stone It growls

EXT THE FAERIE MOUND - DAY 21

A female Faerie steps off quickly Another female steps up
The Stone GROWLS again Kinloch shakes his head

EXT A POND - DAY 22

Maleficent leans down to look at her reflection She pulls
her hair back where the horns used to be She turns
admiring herself without them

STEFAN
What are you doing

MALEFICENT
(embarrassed)
Nothing

STEFAN
You were admiring yourself

She sees that he’s carrying a satchel

MALEFICENT
Where are you going

STEFAN
To the human castle
MALEFICENT
Why
STEFAN

I’ve heard so much about it I want
to see for myself

A sudden feeling of dread overcomes her

MALEFICENT
Don’t go there Stefan

STEFAN
You’re not curious about humans

MALEFICENT
Not at all

STEFAN
I am

MALEFICENT
You would be

STEFAN

(defensively)

What is that supposed to mean

MALEFICENT
You’re half human There’s no shame
in it

STEFAN

I’m going then

She picks dead leaves from a tree branch as if she doesn’t
care

MALEFICENT
Have a good time

He doesn’t go

STEFAN
It’s a long way if I have to
walkon foot

MALEFICENT
How else are you going to walk On
your ears

STEFAN
Maleficent will you take me to the
human castle

MALEFICENT
No

STEFAN
Please

She sighs She can’t say no to him

EXT THE SKY - ON THE WING 23

Maleficent and Stefan fly entwined arms tightly wrapped
around each other’s waists

Stefan’s face is filled with the joy of flight Maleficent’s
with the joy of being close to him

EXT THE CLOUDS - DAY 24
They fly through a thick layer of cloud cover
A stone wall suddenly looms in front of them Maleficent

veers up but their feet hit the edge and they fall onto a
hard unfamiliar surface PULL BACK to reveal

EXT KING HENRY’S CASTLE - THE TURRET 25

They’ve fallen onto the high battlements of the King Henry’s
castle Maleficent looks around uneasily Stefan runs his
hands over the stones

STEFAN
Look at the way the stones fit
together perfectly It’s ingenious

MALEFICENT
It’s unnatural

She touches the wall and shudders

MALEFICENT
The stone is dead

INT THE TOWER STEPS - DAY 26

She follows Stefan down the steps grabbing the iron railing
as she goes She gasps and pulls her hand away

MALEFICENT
Don’t touch the rail It’s iron

Stefan tentatively touches it

STEFAN
I hardly feel anything just a
little sting

She looks at her palm The flesh has been burned He runs
down the steps touching the railing briefly as he goes

Maleficent tucks her hands in her robes Her wings draw
themselves up to avoid the iron railing as well

INT THE GREAT HALL - DAY 27

They enter The hall is crowded with humans and faeries
There’s food drink music and merry-making

Faeries perform aerial acrobatics

Others make rainbows and bring flowers to bloom for the
children The humans gasp and exclaim with delight
Maleficent is appalled by what she sees

MALEFICENT
What is this

Stefan wanders off intrigued Maleficent looks up at the
high arched ceiling feeling trapped

Ominous iron filigree hangs all around She moves through
the hall becoming more dismayed The Pixies have all grown
up as well But they’re still immature and idiotic Flittle
speaks to a group of humans

FLITTLE
I’m in charge of Blue It’s a big
responsibility

WOMAN IN YELLOW DRESS
Can you turn my dress blue

Flittle squeezes her eyes shut and touches her yellow dress
It turns blue

WOMAN IN YELLOW DRESS
Hmm I like it better yellow Turn
it back please

FLITTLE
I don’t make yellow I only make
blue

WOMAN IN YELLOW DRESS
Turn it back

Flustered Flittle closes her eyes and reaches for the
dress but accidentally touches the woman’s hand It
promptly turns BLUE The woman gasps

FLITTLE
Oh dear That’s not what II’m
terribly sorry let me fix

She squeezes her eyes shut again and reaches out brushing
the woman’s face It turns BLUE The woman screams

Panicked Flittle rushes away Maleficent feels someone
tugging at her wings It’s a HUMAN BOY She jerks them away
The boy keeps touching her wings

MALEFICENT
Don’t touch the wings

HUMAN BOY
You’re mean What magic can you do

MALEFICENT
This

She waggles her fingers and walks away

The boy gasps His fingers have grown together so he can’t
pull his hands apart She walks up to Stefan who’s chatting
with PRINCESS LEAH

MALEFICENT
We’re leaving now

STEFAN
What’s wrong

MALEFICENT
What’s wrong Look around This is
an embarrassment

LEAH
Don’t be silly It’s all in fun

Maleficent looks at her sharply

MALEFICENT
Who are you

LEAH
I’m Princess Leah

MALEFICENT
I’ve been accused of being a lot of
things but silly is not one of
them Isn’t that right Stefan

STEFAN
(nervously)
Maybe we should talk over here

He tries to pull her away
MALEFICENT
This may come as a surprise to you
Princess but we don’t exist to
serve the human rabble

STEFAN
Maleficent

He pulls her away

STEFAN
These people are our friends

MALEFICENT
Friends They’re using us I’m
leaving Are you coming

She sees the somber look on his face

MALEFICENT
Stefan

STEFAN
I’m nothing there My own father
has disowned me

Her heart sinks as she realizes

MALEFICENT
You’re not coming back
She

Maleficent

A HALLWAY - EVENING

hurries down the hall

struggling against the tears

In

distress she can’t find her way out She hears voices

words

turns

KING HENRY (0S)
It’s a shame we lost the little
Queen She was so easy to
manipulate

cut through her distress
back to listen

KING’S ADVISOR
What did she die of

KING HENRY
Old age It’s hard to believe she
was over three hundred years old

KING’S ADVISOR
What about the King

KING HENRY
He won’t give us any trouble

She looks through the crack at the door

29 INT A ROOM - NIGHT

The King is talking with his advisors

KING HENRY
Now that we have their trust we
can ask for anything we want

KING’S ADVISOR
They’1l make us rich

KING HENRY
Even better We can use them
against our enemies

KING’S ADVISOR
They’re too unpredictable for that
There’s no way to control them

KING HENRY
They have a weakness

KING’S ADVISOR
What’s that

KING HENRY
Iron

At the door Maleficent reacts with alarm

KING HENRY
I discovered it by accident Then
curiosity got the best of me and I
tried it out on a few of them

KING’S ADVISOR
I would have liked to have seen
that

KING HENRY
Some were burned Some died I was
impressed with their stamina
They’1l make good soldiers for us

The door slams open Maleficent storms in with murder in her

eye Her wings knock the advisors down

She slams Henry against the wall looming over him lik
dark avenging angel He cowers fearfully

MALEFICENT
If you touch another one of us
I’1l kill you
She releases him and storms out The King falls to the
floor trembling and humiliated

INT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Maleficent returns to the hall She looks for Stefan
still talking with Princess Leah

ea

He’s

MALEFICENT
Stefan
STEFAN
I thought you’d gone
MALEFICENT
We have to get our people out of
here
STEFAN

What are you talking about

MALEFICENT
The King is planning to use iron
against us

He looks at her skeptically

STEFAN
Why are you doing this

MALEFICENT
Did you hear what I said

STEFAN
Why must you turn everyone you meet
into an enemy

She backs away shocked by his attitude

She sees guards come in She hurries through the hall
speaking quietly to the faeries

MALEFICENT
Get out Go back to the moors
You’re not safe here

Some hurry away Some stay Everyone’s confused Henry’s
wife QUEEN MARY stands with the Pixies

QUEEN MARY
Who is that

KNOTGRASS
It’s just Maleficent Never mind
her

FLITTLE

She was born to cause trouble

The King runs into the Hall He points at Maleficent

KING HENRY
That one

The guards run toward her

She looks at Stefan Their eyes meet briefly Then she opens
her wings and flies out the window

EXT THE SKIES - NIGHT - ON THE WING 31
She flies wings beating furiously

Tears stream down her face

EXT THE FAERIE MOUND - NIGHT 32

Kinloch yawns as more female faeries line up to try their
luck with the Stone It GROWLS every time

Maleficent lands on the mound

MALEFICENT
Kinloch Call our people back from
the human’s castle

KINLOCH
Why would I do that

MALEFICENT
Their king is plotting against us

KINLOCH
That’s absurd Henry is our friend

MALEFICENT
Is he He knows what iron can do
He’s already used it against us

KINLOCH
I don’t believe you

MALEFICENT
I heard him myself

KINLOCH
But you’re a known liar

MALEFICENT
I have no reason to lie

KINLOCH
Enough Maleficent You’ve caused
nothing but pain and heartbreak
since the day you were born

He waves his hand in a circle
A STORM CLOUD appears above her head Thunder cracks and

she’s pelted with hard cold rain She backs away with the
rain pouring down on her

EXT THE SKY - ON THE WING 33
She flies furiously out of the moors and over the human
farmlands But she can’t get away from the storm cloud She
flies until she’s exhausted

EXT A LARGE TREE - DAY 34

Maleficent lands on a long branch where she sits gasping
and furious The private rain storm still pelts her

ON A CROP FIELD - HER POV

A large RAVEN sits on the head of a SCARECROW Two farmers
throw rocks at him

ANGRY FARMER
Get off

The raven leisurely preens its feathers as the rocks fly
around it Finally a rock hits its target The Raven
squawks and flies to the tree

THE LARGE TREE

The raven lands next to Maleficent She glares at it It
glares back at her They stew in silence After a moment it

hops over on the branch so it won’t get wet

CUT TO

EXT THE MOORS - A RUINED CASTLE - DUSK 35

Crumbling walls are all that’s left of an ancient castle
swathed in thick moor mist Maleficent stands before the
ruins The rain cloud is gone
MALEFICENT
I need your help

She hears guttural breathing and the scratching of claws
Something large approaches The mist stirs Maleficent

waits

In a moment

a MAN walks out of the mist

He holds a

heavy staff He’s even taller than Maleficent and fiercely
handsome with dark malevolent eyes He wears a worn RED CAP
that color of blood Maleficent looks very much like him

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
Take the throne yourself

MALEFICENT
You know why I’ve come

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
I’m always watching You’1ll have to
kill Kinloch

MALEFICENT
I can’t do that

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
Where does this conscience of yours
come from It doesn’t serve you
Your mother was burdened by it too

His dark eyes soften briefly to think of her

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
If you want to save your friends
although I don’t know why you would
after all they’ve done to you

MALEFICENT
I’m the only one who knows what
this human Henry is planning I
can’t stand by and let him use us
like servants and slaves

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
Then act Do what must be done But
you will be hated for it

MALEFICENT
That’s nothing new

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
Then unleash yourself Make me
proud

He steps back The mist swallows him up

CUT TO

EXT A PEAT BOG - NIGHT 36

Maleficent stands at the edge of the muddy bog She closes
her eyes Sweat drips down her forehead as MAGIC flows from
her to the bog It begins to bubble and boil

Something large moves around in the mud One by one five
CREATURES crawl from the bog Her GUARDS are large dour and
ugly with leathern wings long arms that drag the ground and
feet turned backwards As the last one crawls out
Maleficent sags from exhaustion

CUT TO

EXT THE MOORS - NIGHT - ON THE WING 37
Maleficent flies low to the ground followed by her guards

She searches for something on the ground She sees what
she’s looking for scoops them up and flies on

EXT THE FAERIE MOUND - NIGHT 38
The Faeries are still lined up to stand on the Stone Others
entertain themselves with human objects combs brushes
mirrors etc Maleficent lands on the mound

MALEFICENT
I want my turn on the Stone

She walks toward it with determination The Faeries scramble
to get out of her way

FAERIE KING KINLOCH
Stop right there STOP

She steps up onto the Queen’s Stone It SCREAMS in protest
so loud the faeries cringe and hold their ears

FAERIE KING KINLOCH
Step off Step off

But Maleficent holds her ground
Her guards land on the Mound The Stone still screams She
motions to Kinloch They pull him off the throne and drag

him away Maleficent steps off the Queen’s Stone

Its stops screaming abruptly

Maleficent plants herself firmly on the throne Her guards
take their places beside her She takes out the horns she
retrieved from the ground She replaces them on her head and
sits back confidently Queen Maleficent

MALEFICENT
No one leaves the moors for the
human world Not now Not ever

EXT THE HUMAN FARMLANDS - THE NEXT DAY 39

The three Pixies fly toward the Moors carrying gifts from
the humans As they approach the FAERIE PATH it LIGHTS ON
FIRE FLAMES SHOOT skyward in front of the Pixies They draw
back After a moment the FLAMES dissipate

THISTLEWIT
What was that

KNOTGRASS
Sudden inexplicable flames from
nowhere
They fly forward and SMACK into an INVISIBLE WALL They fall
into the grass dropping their loot Thistlewit gets up and
tries to fly forward again She hits the invisible barrier
and falls again She tries yet again and falls

KNOTGRASS
It’s a binding spell

FLITTLE
We cannot pass

Thistlewit keeps flying at the barrier like an angry bee
They drag her away

INT THE GREAT HALL - DAY 40
King Henry and Queen Mary look out over the banquet hall

KING HENRY
Where are all my Fair folk

QUEEN MARY
They’ve gone save for those three

The Pixies sit at the table eating milk and cake

KING HENRY
You three Approach

The Pixies come forward He waits for them to bow Queen
Mary whispers helpfully

QUEEN MARY
Bow to your King

They look at each othershould we Knotgrass shrugs They
bow Flittle feels someone staring at her She looks up to
see the WOMAN with the BLUE FACE glaring at her Flittle
steps behind Thistlewit to hide

KING HENRY

Can you spin straw into gold
KNOTGRASS

No
KING HENRY

Can you conjure up a storm
FLITTLE

No
KING HENRY

What can you do

BLUE-BELL
Were flower pixies

THISTLEWIT
We brighten your day with cheery
blossums and blooms

They flit around bringing all the wilted flowers and
bouquets back to life The King and Queen consult

KING HENRY
We need better ones

QUEEN MARY
(to the Pixies)
Where are all your friends

KNOTGRASS
Someone put out a binding spell
along the Path None of us can pass
through

KING HENRY
Who would do such a thing

QUEEN MARY
It must be that tall bad-tempered
one with the evil nameMalafisis

KING HENRY
Do you know her

They shake their heads vigorously

FLITTLE
She’s no friend of ours

Knotgrass spots Stefan strolling with the princess She
points

KNOTGRASS
But he knows her very well

KING HENRY
You there young man

Stefan looks over and indicatesme

KING HENRY
Approach

Stefan looks at the Princess She smiles encouragingly
Stefan approaches King Henry He bows

KING HENRY
What is your name son

STEFAN
Stefan

KING HENRY

I haven’t seen you before Where
are you from

STEFAN
The moors
QUEEN MARY
No one lives there but the Fair

Folk

They look Stefan over no pointed ears no wings

KING HENRY

You’re not

STEFAN
No sir I’m as human as you are

Thistlewit makes a choking sound Stefan glares at her

QUEEN MARY
You must be a changeling then

KING HENRY
Changeling

QUEEN MARY
He was taken from his cradle as an
infant and raised by the Fair Folk

Stefan doesn’t deny it
KING HENRY

Then you can be of use Do you know
of the evil fairie named Mafil

Macif

STEFAN
Maleficent

KING HENRY
You do know her

STEFAN
I do

KING HENRY
Well

STEFAN
Yes

Henry throws his arm over Stefan’s shoulder

KING HENRY
You’re a good looking fellow I can
see my daughter has taken quite a
liking to you

Stefan’s eyes fill with possibility King Henry steers him
away The Pixies watch all this curiously

THISTLEWIT
I didn’t know Stefan was a
changeling I thought he was a
halfling

KNOTGRASS
He is a halfling But Queen Mary
thinks he’s a changeling

THISTLEWIT
Maybe he’s half a changeling

KNOTGRASS
He’s not half a changeling He’s a
whole halfling

Thistlewit blinks

THISTLEWIT
I’m confused

KNOTGRASS
Of course you are

They move off Flittle almost runs into the Blue Lady who
glares angrily She hurries off with the others

EXT THE MOORS - A ROCKY STREAM - NIGHT

Maleficent walks near a stream followed by her GUARDS The
sounds of the BABBLING STREAM becomes BABBLING VOICES

STREAM FAERY (0S)
The Stone screamed

STREAM FAERY (0S)
She has no right to the throne

STREAM FAERY (0S)
She was wrong to make herself
Queen

She hears them but keeps walking Her guards growl and run
toward the stream faeries

MALEFICENT
Leave them alone

The guards turn back reluctantly They keep following her
breathing down her neck

MALEFICENT
And stop following me

They stop she continues on alone

EXT A DARK POND - NIGHT 42
Maleficent sits on a rock eating black nuts feeling more
alone than ever A LONG GREEN ARM emerges from the pond and
reaches for her ankle
MALEFICENT
Touch me and you will draw back a
shriveled stump

The Green Woman’s arm retreats back to the pond

EXT THE FAERIE PATH —- DAY 43
The once-green Faerie Path is now a long black line of
demarcation between the wild moors and King Henry’s human
domain

EXT THE ROAD - DAY 44
Stefan sits in a wagon next to a DRIVER King Henry’s castle
is visible in the distance behind him

EXT NEAR THE FARM —- DAY 45

The SHEPHERD his WIFE and SON stand at the place where the
Faerie path crosses the road

The sheep stand in a huddle oddly silent The Farmer
whistles for the collies who lay in the farm house yard

THE SHEPHERD
Did you hear me boys Come up

The dogs whine but don’t budge Stefan and the driver
approach in the wagon The horse whinnies and rears

STEFAN’S DRIVER
Whoa

THE SHEPHERD
Your horse won’t cross it

The Shepherd points to the burned and blackened path

Stefan looks up The birds fly straight up and down there
like fish in a tank

THE SHEPHERD

The Fair Folks have put a curse on

us

THE SHEPHERDS WIFE
I can’t think why I put out milk
and cake for them every day

STEFAN
(to the driver)
I’11 walk from here

Stefan gets off with a knapsack The driver turns the wagon

around Stefan steps up to the Faerie path and studies it

STEFAN
(to the shepherd)
Can you cross it
He and his family step back fearfully

THE SHEPHERD
We don’t dare

THE BOY

At night we see a horned bird with

a head of a woman flying in the
sky

SHEPHERD’S WIFE
She has a host of goblins behind
her

Stefan tries to step across It takes an effort for him to

push through the invisible barrier Then something gives way

and he stumbles onto the other side

EXT THE FAERIE SIDE OF THE PATH

Stefan looks around astounded by the sudden difference in

the colors and lushness of the countryside surrounding him
The shepherd and his family wave to him from the other side

THE SHEPHERD
Good luck to you

THE BOY
Watch out for the evil Bird Woman

He starts off following the black line of the Faerie Path

into the wild moors beyond

EXT THE FAERIE MOUND - EVENING 47

Maleficent sits on the throne surrounded by her ugly
slavering guards They scratch and snarl like mangy dogs
Maleficent has her chin in her hand feeling very alone She
hears something and sits up abruptly

MALEFICENT
Quiet

She listens A VOICE on the wind is calling her name

STEFAN (0S)
MALEFICENT

EXT THE MOORS - EVENING 48

Stefan stands on a high hill above the moorlands which sweep
away below him

STEFAN
Maleficent

He squints as he sees something in the distant sky What
appears to be a horned bird with very large wings soars
toward him He watches as Maleficent flies closer His face
is a mixture of joy and regret

EXT THE HILL - DUSK 49

Maleficent lands on the hill Their faces fill with emotion
to see each other again

MALEFICENT
I knew you didn’t belong in the
human world

STEFAN
Oh I belong there more than I do
here

MALEFICENT

Then why did you come back

STEFAN
I missed you too much

Her heart leaps

MALEFICENT
You missed me

STEFAN
I love you Maleficent I always
have

He takes her chin in his hand and kisses her

Her eyes close and she falls back in a swoonoff the
hilltop He looks over

50 EXT THE FAERIE MOUND 50

Her guards look up to see their leader doing giddy air loops
in the distance They frown and grunt with disapproval

51 EXT A RIVER BANK - NIGHT 51

Maleficent and Stefan sit under the shelter of her wings
talking softly

STEFAN
I have to admit there are some
things that humans do better than
we do

MALEFICENT
I can’t imagine what

STEFAN
Food for one thing

He opens his backpack and takes food out

STEFAN
Bread cheese honey cider

He pours a bit of cider into his cup He offers her some
She pushes it away

MALEFICENT
Nothing human for me

STEFAN
You don’t know what you’re missing

MALEFICENT
I’m perfectly happy with what we
have

She tips a large red Blood Rose that blooms on a twisting
vine Red dew drops into her mouth

STEFAN
I wonder what it would taste like
if we mixed the two together

He tips the Blood Rose into his cup

STEFAN
The best of both worlds

He swirls it around and takes a sip

STEFAN
Not bad

He takes another teeny sip Maleficent considers Giving in
she holds out her hand for the cup but he holds it back

STEFAN
Nothing human for you

They tussle over the cup She grabs it out of his hand and
takes a big gulp He waits for the verdict She takes
another drink considers

MALEFICENT
It’s dreadful

He laughs She smiles at him Love shines through her whole
being

MALEFICENT
Promise me you will never leave
again

STEFAN

Never They lay back against the
tree together

MALEFICENT
I want this moment to last forever

STEFAN
We have forever

She closes her eyes drifting off But she opens them
suddenly panicked

MALEFICENT
Stefan

STEFAN
Yes

MALEFICENT
I was afraid you’d gone

STEFAN
Still here

She sighs with contentment and closes her eyes again

EXT THE RIVER BANK —- LATER 52

Maleficent has fallen into a deep unnatural slumber Stefan
sits beside her

STEFAN
Maleficent

He shakes her shoulder roughly

STEFAN
Maleficent

She doesn’t stir He takes a long thin IRON CHAIN from his
pack He holds it over her His hands tremble His face is
wracked with emotion He shakes his head and drops his
hands After a moment he lifts the chain again

CUT TO

EXT THE RIVER BANK — DAWN 53

Maleficent groans from pain She sits up and shakes her head
to clear the thick sleep The pain on her back is intense
She looks around for Stefan then reaches over her shoulder
Her fingers touch a long cauterized burn where her wings
used to be On the shock and horror in her eyes we

CUT TO

EXT HUMAN FARMLANDS 54

Stefan runs down the road carrying a large bundle on his
back The DRIVER sits in the wagon nearby He jumps off to
help him load the bundle

MALEFICENT (0S)
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH

Her ANGUISHED OUTRAGED WAIL echoes down the hills and across
the Moorlands Stefan looks up At the sound the BURLAP
BUNDLE shifts and struggles

STEFAN
I shouldn’t have done it

THE DRIVER
It’s too late now

They lash the bundle down and quickly drive away

EXT THE RIVER BANK — DAY 55
Maleficent thrashes around trying to reach the painful
wounds She plunges into the river The WATER FAERIES

retreat watching with huge fearful eyes Maleficent climbs
out and runs delirious from the agonizing pain

EXT THE MOORS - DAY 56
She runs to escape the pain

At the top of a high hill she leaps into the air
forgetting in her delirium that she no longer has wings
She falls crashing down the hill to the bottom where she
lies gasping and bloodied

As she lays there she looks up at the birds flying
overhead Her pain and heartbreak are unspeakable

EXT KING HENRY’S CASTLE - DAY 57

The drawbridge opens for Stefan’s wagon

INT KING HENRY’S CASTLE - DAY 58

Stefan stands with King Henry The bundle lays at his feet
no longer moving

STEFAN
I couldn’t kill her So I took
these instead

He draws back the burlap
The large black wings are tied with heavy ropes Fascinated

King Henry leans down for a closer look The Wings struggle
startling him He leaps back

STEFAN
Her wings have always had a mind of
their own

KING HENRY
Will she want revenge for this

STEFAN
Absolutely But she’s hobbled now
The Fair People won’t follow a
wingless leader

KING HENRY
Brilliant son You’ve served me
well

STEFAN

And the other thing
Henry sighs He has no choice
KING HENRY
I’‘1l tell the Queen to prepare for
a wedding

Stefan nods

Whatever guilt he felt has been swept aside by ambition

EXT THE MOORS - NIGHT 59

Maleficent still lies in the place she fell Something has
left her forever hope belief the capacity for love

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
Get up Maleficent

She opens her eyes
Her father stands over her holding his staff
MALEFICENT’S FATHER
This pain is a gift You can use it
to grow stronger than you ever
were

She closes her eyes again

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
Or you can lay here and die

He drops his staff at her side and walks away

A long moment passes before her fingers feel for the staff
She uses it to pull herself to her feet

A WOLF howls

Leaning on the staff she sees a LARGE SILVER WOLF on a
distant hill It turns and disappears into the mist

EXT THE FAERIE PATH — NEAR THE FARM 60

Using the staff as a crutch Maleficent limps across the
blackened Faerie Path

Her eyes are filled with hatred She limps past the farmer’s
house and paddock As she passes the gate opens The sheep

run out She walks through the middle of human crop fields

The crops wither on the vine in her wake

EXT THE FARMLANDS - VARIOUS - TIME PASSAGE 61

The weather changes Clouds move across the sky Maleficent
still walks But she’s stronger now She stands more
upright leaning less on the staff

Dry stone walls collapse where her staff hits the ground
She walks with a stronger stride The staff is no longer a
crutch She plants it on the ground near a barn and
farmhouse The ground shakes violently The structures
collapse Farmers families and animals run out

She stands near a town She lifts the staff Storm clouds
suddenly move in A high wind blows Lightning hits the
church steeple

EXT A HILL - EVENING 62
Maleficent stands on a hill overlooking her path of
destruction Nothing built of human hands remains standing
She seems stronger than ever

Her gaze is intense and fierce all weakness gone She
smiles for the first time since Stefan took her wings But

there’s a hard glint in her eye that wasn’t there before

CUT TO

INT MALEFICENT’S RETREAT - DUSK 63

Maleficent sleeps in a dark place in the woods near crop
fields She opens her eyes at the sound of birds

She looks up to watch the birds ride the wind in the sky
above She’s lost in bittersweet memories briefly

DIAVAL (0S)
Awk

EXT A FARMERS FIELD - HER POV 64
The raven from years earlier sits on a stalk studying a
pile of ripe corn on the ground It flies down and snatches
an ear A heavy net falls over him

ANGRY FARMER 1
Got him

The raven struggles to escape

DIAVAL
Awk Awk

The two farmers approach with heavy clubs

From her retreat Maleficent watches the humans hatefully
The farmers advance on the bird raising their clubs

MALEFICENT (0S)
Now a man

The raven transforms into a MAN DIAVAL finds himself on the
ground in a naked human body The Farmers are stunned
Diaval throws off the net and climbs to his feet unsteadily

ANGRY FARMER
It’s a devil

Diaval grabs the club and swings at them
DIAVAL
I am the devil I come from hell

for you

The frightened farmers run Diaval drops the club and looks
at his human body with dismay

As a MAN Diaval is black-Irish with silky black hair and
dark eyes His voice has a rich melodic Irish lilt

He also has a touch of vanity and he’s prone to preening
Maleficent steps out of the shadows

DIAVAL
What have you done to my beautiful
self

MALEFICENT

Would you rather I let them beat
you to death

He lifts his wingless arms and looks down at his naked body

DIAVAL
I’m not certain

MALEFICENT
Stop complaining I saved your
life

DIAVAL

Forgive me I am in your debt
She tosses him a cape to cover himself He looks her over

DIAVAL
What happened to your wings

MALEFICENT
You remember me

DIAVAL
They were magnificent

MALEFICENT
Youll be my wings now

65 INT HENRY’S CASTLE - THE HALL - DAY 65
King Henry rants and raves at Stefan

KING HENRY
You said they would return

STEFAN
I never said

KING HENRY
You said they wouldn’t follow a
wingless leader

44

STEFAN
The binding spell is still in
place

KING HENRY

I don’t want excuses I should be
rich and control of all the land
Instead my kingdom is in ruins He
wave toward the open window Stefan
glances out

EXT THE COUNTRYSIDE - THEIR POV 66
The crops are dead The human structures are destroyed as if
a tornado has come through

INT THE TOWER - THE SAME VIEW 67

The Pixies stand on the tower battlements looking out
Butterflies swarm around Flittle’s head

FLITTLE
Do you think Maleficent did this

KNOTGRASS
Who else could it be

THISTLEWIT
Why would she do it

FLITTLE
She’s evil for evil’s sake

THISTLEWIT
What does that mean

KNOTGRASS
She doesn’t need a reason
INT THE TOWER STAIRS - DAY 68
They go down the winding stairs to a small landing They go
through one door then down another set of stairs They turn

in a circle confused

FLITTLE
Where are we

KNOTGRASS
This way

THISTLEWIT
No this way

She opens the door She gasps at what she sees inside She
stumbles back into the other two They lose their footing
and all fall screaming down the stairs

INT THE GREAT HALL - DAY 69

KING HENRY
I should have known not to trust
someone who was raised by elves

STEFAN
Fair People

KING HENRY
If you don’t do something about
that evil witch

STEFAN
She’s not a witch

KING HENRY
I gave you my daughter’s hand I
made you next in line to my throne
If you don’t do something I’1l
annul the marriage and throw you in
the dungeon

The Pixies tumble into the room and land in a pile on the
floor Flittle’s butterflies scatter in the air

KING HENRY
Get those useless imbeciles out of

my
One of the butterflies flies into his mouth
He sucks it in gags and chokes
The Faeries giggle Henry staggers trying to breathe His
crown falls onto the floor Stefan’s eyes fill with a dark
realization He waves the Pixies away
Knotgrass and Flittle grab Thistlewit and run out
Henry’s face is turning purple Stefan leans down Henry

thinks he’s going to help him But Stefan merely picks up
the fallen crown and walks out

ON THE WINDOW

Diaval the Raven has seen the whole thing He flies away

EXT STEFAN’S FOREST - LATER 70

Maleficent paces in a clearing Diaval the Man has
finished telling her what he witnessed

MALEFICENT
And now he’1ll be king He did this
to me so he could be king

She screams with frustration and rage WHITE FIRE erupts
from her A nearby tree bursts into flames

The flames sweep from one tree to the next She’s so lost in
her fury she doesn’t realize she’s set the trees on fire

DIAVAL
Mistress You don’t know what
youre doing This is not what you
want Mistress

His words get through Her anger fades and now she sees the
trees burning

MALEFICENT
No

She closes her eyes With a supreme effort she draws the
flames back into herself

She closes her ROBES snuffing them out then falls to her
knees exhausted Smoke rises from her

She looks up aghast to see the ruined trees She closes her
eyes again New magic flows from her to the trees

New bark grows new green leaves sprout Soon they are as
beautiful as they were She stands up renewed as if a deep
catharsis has occurred

MALEFICENT
Come Diaval I’ve been gone too
long

He lands on her shoulder

EXT THE FAERIE MOUND - NIGHT 71

Kinloch and a group of faeries attempt to retake the throne
while Maleficent’s guards are sleeping

But they wake up slavering and snarling Kinloch throws
MAGIC at them but it has no effect

The guards advance on them The largest guard throws Kinloch
to the ground and steps on him laughing

The others grab faeries and toss them into the air like rag
dolls or attempt to pull their wings off like cruel
children The faeries scream

MALEFICENT (0S)
Stop

The Guards drop the faeries and look around nervously
Maleficent stands in the shadows with Diaval on her
shoulder She sets the Horns on her head then gathers her

courage and steps boldly into view

KINLOCH
Maleficent

She sets her jaw and walks through the astonished faeries
toward the throne

A FAERIE
Where are her wings

ANOTHER FAERIE
She’s lost her wings

She faces the largest guard who stands between her and the
throne She waves him out of her way

MALEFICENT
Move

He spits at her Brackish ooze rolls down her cheek
The Fearies pull back nervously She moves to grab him but
he flies up into the air The other Guards fly up and circle

her from above

DIAVAL
AWK

He starts to fly up to defend her

MALEFICENT
Diaval

She waves him away She looks up at her own minions circling
above They drop down claws extended screaming like
banshees She fights them with white fire and sheer power of
will

Finally all the five guards lay on the ground at her
feet subdued but alive

Gasping and bloodied from the fight she walks past them and
steps onto the Queen’s Stone on her way to the throne The
Stone SCREAMS startling her She stumbles off then turns
back to it angrily

MALEFICENT
I’ve had enough of that

She holds her staff out over the Stone and slowly raises it
The Stone is uprooted from the ground

It hangs in the air She makes a motion with her Staff
The Stone is flung away It lands with a heavy THUD
somewhere in the far distance She sits down on the throne

Diaval lands on her shoulder

MALEFICENT
Anyone else want to challenge me

No one says a word

EXT THE MOORS - A STREAM - DAY 72

Maleficent bathes in the cold water Diaval lands on a tree
branch nearby Maleficent washes her back and finds one of
the long raised scars Her fingers linger there

Maleficent covers herself with her cape as she emerges from
the water She waves her hand

MALEFICENT
Now a man

Diaval transforms into a MAN hidden by bushes She tosses
him a small bag of clothes she carries for him

MALEFICENT
Tell me

Diaval emerges fully clothed He’s nervous about delivering
the news
DIAVAL
King Stefan and Queen Leah have had
a child

The news she had been dreading
MALEFICENT
Oh blessed day Have they named the
little beast

DIAVAL
Aurora

MALEFICENT
The dawn How clever

DIAVAL
They’re having a christening soon

MALEFICENT
And you didn’t bring my invitation
73 EXT KING STEFAN’S CASTLE - DAY
People dressed in formal attire approach the castle

Festive flags fly

74 INT THE GREAT HALL - DAY

People fill the hall Stefan and Leah greet the well
wishers Knotgrass Flittle and Thistlewit enter

STEFAN
Not those three

LEAH
Be gracious Stefan They have
magical gifts for our child

STEFAN
I don’t want any butter-flies
around the baby

The Pixies stand over the baby’s bassinet

Old Queen Mary attends her Knotgrass reaches in and touches

the baby’s forehead

KNOTGRASS
Sweet Aurora I give you the gift
of beauty

Flittle reaches in to touch the baby

FLITTLE
Dear child you will

She notices the Blue Lady in the crowd

FLITTLE
--never be blue but happy all the
days of your life

It’s Thistlewit turn A doors bang open WIND whistles
through THUNDER CRACKS and Maleficent is there Diaval
flies in and perches on her shoulder

STEFAN
Maleficent

He’s suddenly very afraid

MALEFICENT
So Stefan you’re king at last
It’s what you always wanted You
would have done anythingwell
you did

STEFAN
You’re not welcome here

MALEFICENT
And I’m deeply offended by that
(to Leah)
Ahthe lovely Leah But where is
the child You must be so proud

STEFAN
Stay away from her

MALEFICENT
Oh Stefando you really think I
would harm an innocent babe I only
want to view the little creature

The Pixies stands in front of the bassinet protectively
Maleficent laughs

MALEFICENT
You three Well there’s fierce
protection Out of my way gnats

She blows at them A FIERCE WIND blows them back

Part of Thistlewit’s hair is blown off She grabs her head
aghast Maleficent pulls aside the drapery and leans over
the bassinet

BABY AURORA is as adorable as babies get As she looks at
the baby jealousy fills her heart The old anger and
revenge rise up in her again She looks at Stefan as if it
is only the two of them in the room

MALEFICENT
You stole something precious from
me And now you owe me something
precious in return

STEFAN
What are you going to do

MALEFICENT
Take what I am owed

STEFAN
Guards

They start to run toward her but Maleficent holds her staff
up They freeze mid-step

MALEFICENT
Calm down I’m not going to steal
your baby I merely want to give
her a gift

She looks down at the baby again

MALEFICENT
The child will indeed be blessed
with beauty and happiness all the
days of her brief human life

LEAH
Did you saybrief

MALEFICENT
Enjoy your little girl while you
can Princess You’1ll have her
until her sixteenth birthday They
can be such monsters at that age
youll probably thank me for this

Leah is so frightened she’s almost in tears

LEAH
For what

STEFAN
Guards

They still can’t move

MALEFICENT
Listen At midnight on her
sixteenth birthday something will
happen a small thing really a
simple mishap

She glances into the corner and sees Queen Mary’s SPINNING
WHEEL

MALEFICENT
She’1l prick her pretty little
finger on the spindle of a spinning
wheel

She looks around at the frightened faces holding their
breaths Maleficent takes her time enjoying this

MALEFICENT
And die

Faces fill with horror Leah screams She looks at Stefan

MALEFICENT
Fair is fair

STEFAN
Please don’t do this I’m sorry
for what I did to you
Maleficent laughs

MALEFICENT
Not sorry enough

She lifts her robes White fire erupts around her

STEFAN
Wait Listen to me

She disappears in the smoke Diaval circles the hall He
flies out the open door Commotion erupts Leah runs to the
bassinet and scoops up the child

LEAH
Stefan Do something

Flustered he points to Thistlewit

STEFAN
You You haven’t given your gift
yet
LEAH
Can she undo the curse
KNOTGRASS
No Maleficent’s much too powerful
now
STEFAN
But you could alter it somehow
THISTLEWIT
Alter it
STEFAN

Change it you idiot Change
Maleficent’s curse

THISTLEWIT
But I’m only a flower pixie

KNOTGRASS
We’ll help you

Knotgrass and Flittle take her hands Leah holds the baby
out toward her Flittle’s butterflies flit around her

THISTLEWIT
I can’t think with all these
butterflies

Flittle draws her butterflies away Knotgrass whispers in
her ear Thistlewit repeats it

THISTLEWIT
Aurora will prick her finger on her
sixteenth birthday But it will not
beuhuh

Knotgrass whispers again She continues
THISTLEWIT
death that claims her only

sleep

Stefan nods Now Flittle whispers into Thistlewit’s ear

THISTLEWIT
And she can only be woken by true
love’s kiss

Thistlewit touches the baby’s forehead

THISTLEWIT
Done

LEAH
My child is saved

STEFAN
Maleficent won’t be stopped that
easily Burn all the spinning
wheels

CUT TO

75 EXT THE MOORS - THE FAERIE MOUND - NIGHT 75

Maleficent sits on her throne telling the guards all about
it Diaval watches from nearby

MALEFICENT
He was begging me You should have
seen their faces Not our baby
She sighs with deep satisfaction
MALEFICENT
Revenge is everything they say it
is
The Guards grunt and slaver in agreement But Diaval twists
his head bothered
76 EXT KING STEFAN’S CASTLE - THE NURSERY - NIGHT 76

The Pixies and Queen Mary watch over the bassinet Queen
Mary snores

THISTLEWIT
I don’t think Stefan like us very
much

KNOTGRASS

We did treat him badly when he was
young

FLITTLE
It was his fault for being a
halfling

KNOTGRASS

Hed like to get rid of us but we
know too much

Flittle sighs playing with her butterflies
FLITTLE

I wish we could go home to our
fields and flowers

KNOTGRASS
Maleficent will never let us come
back now
THISTLEWIT
So we’re trapped here with mean
Stefan
Stefan enters
STEFAN

Mean King Stefan And you’re right
I cannot stand the three of you So
I have a task that will keep you
out of my sight for a very long
time

EXT KING STEFAN’S CASTLE - NIGHT
The Pixies sit in a wagon in rough peasant clothes

Leah holds the baby distraught Diaval watches from a
nearby tree

LEAH
Don’t do this

STEFAN
Do you want our child to be safe

He pulls the baby out of her arms and hands her to the
Pixies

STEFAN
Take the baby deep into the forest
Hide her there On the day after
her sixteenth birthday bring her
back to us Do you understand

They nod

STEFAN
Say it What will you do

PIXIES
Hide the baby in the woods

STEFAN
Until when

PIXIES
Until her sixteenth birthday

THISTLEWIT

EXT THE ROAD - DAY

Diaval sits in a tree at the side of the road The Pixies’

wagon stops beneath A baby cries in the back

KNOTGRASS
Don your kerchiefs ladies We must
wear them at all times so we will
not be recognized

They put them on The wagon continues on

EXT A CLEARING IN THE FOREST - LATER 79

An abandoned cottage sits a clearing Diaval lands on the
roof The Pixies’ wagon approaches

KNOTGRASS
What we need is an abandoned
cottage where no one will find us

He squawks to draw their attention

DIAVAL
Awk

FLITTLE
Like that one

She points to the cottage

KNOTGRASS
Exactly We need a cottage just
like that Be on the look-out

They keep driving past it right out of the clearing Diaval
twists his head as if he can’t believe what idiots they are
After a moment the wagon appears again

The Pixies study the cottage then scream and run to it
They brush away cobwebs open the door and go inside
Flowers burst from the windows Climbing roses speed up the
rough walls Diaval flies off

and Diaval peek into the window at the baby in a basket

sorry for it

Diaval looks in at the baby
ON THE BABY - HIS POV

It gurgles Nothing could be cuter They hear the Pixies and
back away

ON THE KITCHEN - THEIR POV

The Pixies stand around the basket looking at the baby who’s
started to cry

FLITTLE
I can’t stand the crying She’s
giving me a headache

KNOTGRASS
Quiet baby

FLITTLE
All she thinks about is herself

KNOTGRASS
Maybe she’s be hungry

THISTLEWIT
Do you think she likes fruit

KNOTGRASS
All babies like fruit

They put a whole uncut apple a banana and an orange in the
basket with the baby

FLITTLE
That should shut her up for awhile

They walk away

EXT THE COTTAGE - DAY 82

MALEFICENT
That baby’s going to starve with
those three looking after it

Maleficent walks away unconcerned Diaval twists his head
worried for the child He flies away briefly then returns
with a large WHITE FLOWER

He holds the MILK FLOWER to the baby’s mouth She sucks on
it happily

Stefan’s men are on the hunt for
you He’s armed them with iron
weapons

MALEFICENT
I have weapons of a different sort

She lifts her staff A thick MIST rises up in the forest
ON STEFAN’S MEN

They’re enveloped in impenetrable MIST There’s mass
confusion

CAPTAIN
Retreat

ON MALEFICENT
She moves away through the forest

Without warning Stefan’s MEN come out of the mist directly
ahead Their horses charge toward her

She doesn’t have time to run Suddenly an ENORMOUS SILVER
WOLF leaps out in front of her

The horses panic and rear

The WOLF chases them away Maleficent sits down on a rock
and waits In a moment her father approaches

MALEFICENT
I could have handled that myself

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
I shouldn’t have interfered

MALEFICENT
It’s not like you

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
I don’t know what came over me But
I’m glad to see that you’ve come
back with a vengeance The curse
was masterful

MALEFICENT
Stefan deserves everything he gets

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
An eye for an eye Tooth for a
tooth

MALEFICENT
Exactly

MALEFICENT’S FATHER

sort of thing I would have done

He walks away into the mist Maleficent thinks about that
oddly unsettled

But they’ve already closed the door She pounds on it but
no one answers She cries Still no one comes

Maleficent’s staff lifts the SNAKE and tosses it away

ON MALEFICENT

She stands over the sleeping child

if admonishing herself for having a weak moment She glances
up at Diaval in the tree

Be a bird

But this time he catches her hand and holds it
DIAVAL
Every time you don’t like what I
have to say you transform me back
into a bird

MALEFICENT
I thought you liked being a bird

Sire My men and I have searched

rainstorms blizzards gale force
winds scorching heat and the
attack of countless wild creatures
But Maleficent is not to be found
I am sorry I have failed you

STEFAN
You’re dismissed

The Captain trudges off secretly relieved

Why are you still looking for that
witch

STEFAN
She’s not a witch

were

Leah looks at her husband curiously

behind us

STEFAN
I had all the spinning wheels
destroyed

LEAH
It’s been years I’m certain
Maleficent has forgotten all about
that silly insult at the
christening

to remain diligent especially now

We’re not free to go to the human
world

MALEFICENT
Ah well that’s a price we all must
learn to live with Now go away
before I become unpleasant

KINLOCH
(under his breath)
Become
Maleficent heard that She levels her dark gaze on him
MALEFICENT
This is not unpleasant Do you want
to see what unpleasant looks like

Maleficent’s face changes

Her darkest nature comes to the surface Anger and
bitterness twist her face so that she does look truly

AURORA
And where are all these butterflies
coming from

No one ventures an answer

And why do you always ignore my
questions

They putter around the kitchen

AURORA
Do all of the Fair People have

What color were they

Black And that’s enough about

them
Aurora waits a minute

AURORA
How big were they

MALEFICENT
Aurora

Aurora goes quiet Maleficent looks off remembering

MALEFICENT
So big they dragged behind me when
I walked And they were strong
They could carry me above the
clouds and straight into the
headwinds They never faltered Not
once I could trust them

Aurora can see her loss and regret She takes her hand
Maleficent looks down at Stefan’s child’s hand in her own
Her heart freezes She pulls it away

MALEFICENT
Time to go back

EXT THE MOORS - NEAR DAWN 116

They walk back together across the misty hills Diaval flies
above

AURORA
I have a confession to make

Fe

MALEFICENT
Do you

AURORA
All day long all I can think about
is coming back to the moors I love
it here It feels like home to me

MALEFICENT
This is not your home

Aurora walks a little ahead of her
AURORA
Then where is it And don’t tell me
it’s that cottage with my aunts
She steps onto the edge of a WHITE STONE that juts up from
the ground As her foot lands briefly on it it ROARS
shaking the ground Aurora jumps off quickly

AURORA
What was that

Maleficent looks around alarmed

MALEFICENT
Come back Quickly

Aurora hurries back toward her and steps on the stone again
It ROARS Aurora runs to her side Maleficent and Diaval
look at the white stone

ON THE QUEENS STONE

It’s tilted and half-buried in sod and grass

MALEFICENT
So that’s where it fell

Aurora approaches

AURORA
What is it

Maleficent looks from the Queen’s Stone to Auroraand back
again with shock and realization

AURORA
What’s wrong

MALEFICENT
Nothing Go to sleep

She waves her hand in front of her eyes

Aurora goes limp Maleficent keeps her aloft as she sleeps
She looks at Diaval

MALEFICENT
How is it possible

She closes her eyes and holds her staff out over the Stone
She slowly raises it out of the ground and sets it upright
on top of the ground She brushes the dirt away

Then she slowly lowers the prone sleeping Aurora onto the
Queen’s Stone She’s so small she fits on it perfectly

As her body settles down the STONE PURRS exactly the way
it did when Ulla stood on it years earlier Maleficent looks
at Diaval with disbelief

CUT TO

appears

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
This is an interesting twist of
fate

MALEFICENT
If Aurora is the true Queen then
maybe I should step down

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
Youd give up your throne To the
child of your sworn enemy no less
What’s gotten into you

MALEFICENT
It was never mine I took it by
force

MALEFICENT’S FATHER
You did what had to be done at the
time Forget about the Stone Bury

think the raven is right about you

He seems disappointed as he walks back into the ruins

Aurora out of the Green Woman’s grip

Aurora swims to the surface as Maleficent the Green Woman
and Diaval battle underwater

in the water She picks him up and lays him on the bank He

doesn’t move

She waves his hands over him frantically

MALEFICENT
Now a man

Diaval transforms But he’s still not breathing

She pounds on his chest He gasps suddenly and gulps for
air Maleficent leans back more relieved than she ever
thought she’d be Diaval sits up

Then what would I do for wings

Diaval covers his disappointment at her cavalier attitude
He looks around

AURORA

I don’t want to go on a journey
KNOTGRASS

They throw clothes at her

EXT THE COTTAGE - DAY 126

The Pixies are in the wagon Aurora is reluctant She looks
out at the moors

AURORA
There’s someone I need to talk to

KNOTGRASS
Who You don’t know anyone

AURORA
I’m not going

Knotgrass finally loses it

KNOTGRASS
Sixteen years We’ve looked after
you out here in the middle of
nowhere in that broken down raggedy
hovel for sixteen years

FLITTLE
Weve put up with your whining and
crying and puking

THISTLEWIT
And all your stupid questions that
we don’t know the answers to

KNOTGRASS
We’ve done our job And now we’re
giving you back Get in the wagon

They pull her into the wagon forcefully and jam her in
between them Knotgrass whips the horse Aurora looks back
at the moors as they drive off

EXT KING STEFAN’S CASTLE - EVENING 127
The Pixies wagon approaches the castle at a dead run
INT THE GREAT HALL - EVENING 128

The hall is being set up for Aurora’s arrival the next day
Servants set up tables

Children run through Leah holds a baby The Pixies enter
with Aurora She’s utterly bewildered

PIXIES

STEFAN
What are you doing here You are
not to arrive until tomorrow

KNOTGRASS
Today is her sixteenth birthday

STEFAN
I told you to bring her the day
after her birthday

Aurora looks around at the heavy oppressive roomthe iron
filigree above She puts her hand on the stone wall and
pulls it back quickly She shudders

THISTLEWIT
Well it’s been a long time How
can we be expected to remember

STEFAN
I should have known not to trust
Flower Pixies Where’s the child

He looks right past Aurora They push her toward him

FLITTLE

father

Aurora is so shocked she can’t speak Leah hands her baby to
a nursemaid and opens her arms to Aurora

LEAH
Come over here and let me have a
look at you

She backs up a step
STEFAN
What are we going to do with her
The idiot Pixies have brought her
back a day too soon

Flittle folds her arms

FLITTLE
Well we’re not taking her back

AURORA
I can’t stay anyway

She rubs the tip of her index finger absently
STEFAN
Well have to lock you in a safe

place for the night

AURORA
Why

LEAH
I know it’s a terrible homecoming
dear But your father’s worried
about some old curse

AURORA
I have to go back to the moors

STEFAN
That life is over

Stefan pulls her away Flittle sees the lady with the Blue
Face who has grown much older She points at Flittle

BLUE LADY
You ruined my life

Flittle grabs Knotgrass urgently
FLITTLE
I’ve changed my mind I want to go
back to the horrid little cottage

INT THE HALL — DAY 129

Stefan ushers Aurora firmly down the hall

AURORA
Let me go back Please This is a
mistake

STEFAN

The whining and begging may have
softened the Pixies but not me

He puts her in a room

STEFAN
Welcome home We’1ll talk in the
morning when this is all over

He closes the door and locks it

EXT THE COTTAGE - NIGHT 130

Shutters bang on the windows Diaval lands on the sill and
looks in

DIAVAL
Awk Awk

Maleficent emerges from the shadows and goes inside

INT THE COTTAGE - NIGHT 131
She walks though the messy abandoned cottage
The flowers are wilted without the Pixies presence there

One stray butterfly has been left behind She goes into
Aurora’s bedroom

INT AURORA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 132
But the bed is empty Alarm floods her face

MALEFICENT
Diaval

He flies in the window

MALEFICENT
Those idiots have taken her Fly to
Stefan’s castle I have no wings
Fly

INT STEFAN’S CASTLE - THE KITCHEN - NIGHT 133

The Pixies gorge themselves on milk and pastries while the
servants bustle around them Diaval lands in the window

KNOTGRASS
Even if we did bring her back too
soon weve still foiled
Maleficent’s curse

FLITTLE
She won’t die when she pricks her
finger Thanks to our quick
thinking

THISTLEWIT
My quick thinking I was the one
who said It will not be death
that claims her only sleep

Diaval twists his head curiously

KNOTGRASS

I gave that idea to you
THISTLEWIT

No you didn’t
KNOTGRASS

Yes I did
FLITTLE

And I thought up the part about
true love’s kiss

THISTLEWIT
No you didn’t

KNOTGRASS
Yes she did

THISTLEWIT
It was my spell I said She can
only be woken by true love’s kiss

KNOTGRASS
We gave it all to you

THISTLEWIT
No you didn’t

Diaval has heard enough He flies away

INT AURORA’S ROOM - NIGHT 134

The moon shines on Aurora who rubs the tip of her index
finger again She goes to the window and looks out Diaval
lands on the sill

He flies off

AURORA
Where are you going

She rubs her finger again

INT THE HALLWAY - NIGHT 135

Stefan paces nervously as he talks to his men The small key
to Aurora’s room sits on a table

STEFAN
Maleficent will come at midnight to
watch her curse unfold The moment
she appears use the iron Do not
hesitate

Diaval lands on the table Stefan sees him

He realizes and makes a grab for him Diaval evades him and
snatches the key in his beak

STEFAN
Catch that bird

Diaval flies around with the key in his beak evading the
men He flies out of the room Diaval flies down the hall
with Stefan’s men behind He startles the oncoming servants
and knocks over tables and chairs

INT AURORA’S ROOM - NIGHT 136
She hears a commotion in the hall A key rattles in the
door

EXT THE HALL - ON AURORA’S DOOR 137

Diaval flutters as he tries to fit the key in the lock with
his beak Stefan’s men run toward him

He finally manages to fit it in The men throw objects He
evades them then turns the key with his beak

INT AURORA’S ROOM - NIGHT 138
She hears the lock turn and turns the knob
The door opens
Outside the guards and servants scream and throw things at
the raven who flaps around to distract them Aurora slips
away unseen
EXT THE ROAD - NIGHT 139
Maleficent runs as fast as her feet will take her She looks
skyward wishing desperately for wings
EXT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 140

Aurora
EXT THE ROAD - NIGHT 141

Diaval flies toward Maleficent He swoops down She waves
her hand

MALEFICENT
Now a man

He hits the ground running transformed into a MAN
Maleficent tosses him a bag of clothes

DIAVAL
The Pixies changed your curse

MALEFICENT
My curse was undone years ago

DIAVAL
They replaced it with their own
MALEFICENT
The Pixies They’re not smart
enough
DIAVAL
(impatiently)

Listen When she pricks her finger
tonight Aurora will fall asleep
MALEFICENT
Fall asleep Now there’s a nasty
curse

DIAVAL
And she can only be woken by true
love’s kiss

Her laughter fades abruptly

MALEFICENT
Say that again

DIAVAL
She can only be woken by true
love’s kiss

MALEFICENT

But there’s no such thing
DIAVAL

What
MALEFICENT

There’s no such thing as true

never wake up She’1ll sleep
forever We have to stop her

AURORA
Hello Godmother

Hello beastie

She pulls her into her arms Joyful tears fall Diaval is
overwhelmed as well

DIAVAL
No truer love

He joins them

AURORA
Can we go home to the moors now

MALEFICENT
Right now

There’s voices in the hall

DIAVAL
Wait

He opens the door cautiously

INT THE HALL - NIGHT 156
It’s eerily quiet No servants No sounds

MALEFICENT
Now a bird

Diaval transforms and flies ahead to investigate

INT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 157

He flies into the great hall Maleficent and Aurora follow
There are no servants No one about The door on the
opposite side of the room stands open Escape

Maleficent’s eyes narrow suspiciously
They slink along the wall toward the open door Diaval flies

up to the rafters He lands on the iron filigree where a
heavy IRON NET has been hung

DIAVAL
Awk

Maleficent looks up Stefan appears at the door

STEFAN
Drop it

The iron net falls from the ceiling Maleficent pushes
Aurora out of the way

MALEFICENT
Get out of the castle

She falls to her knees dropping her staff The net burns her
exposed flesh

Aurora tries to pull the heavy iron net off of her

MALEFICENT
Get out of here Go back to the
moors

Aurora backs away reluctantly

MALEFICENT
Go now

Aurora runs Stefan nods for some of his men to go after
her Other men run out with iron weapons and poke at
Maleficent like a trapped animal

The Pixies watch with horrified fascination

INT THE TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT 158

Aurora runs up the stairs trying to get away from Stefan’s
men She reaches a landing runs through a door and finds
herself in another stairwell She keeps climbing

THE GREAT HALL

Maleficent tries to get up but she’s weakened by the iron
She reaches for her staff Stefan kicks it out of the way
He walks around her

STEFAN
I should have killed you that
night It would have saved us alla
lot of trouble

She glares at him with silent hatred He nods to his men
Stefan’s men draw their weapons Diaval drops down from out
of the rafters at them

STEFAN
Kill that bird

Some fight him off

Others stab at Maleficent She grabs their weapons through
the net even though it burns her hands

INT THE TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT 159

Aurora flings open the door at the top of the stairs and
runs inside She peeks out to see if anyone’s following but
feels something behind her She turns Her eyes go wide

ON MALEFICENT’S WINGS

Her wings are bound in chains held upright in a glass
coffin Aurora approaches them awed by their size and
beauty She looks through the glass

They flutter suddenly Still alive She steps back They
flap and struggle against their bonds Realization fills
Aurora’s eyes She places her hand on the glass

AURORA
Shhh She’s here

The wings settle down Aurora touches the heavy iron lock
She gasps as it burns her

INT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 160
Diaval fights Stefan’s men

MALEFICENT
Now an eagle

He transforms into an EAGLE

He grabs the iron net over Maleficent and pulls it away She
gets to her feet Stefan runs at her with his iron sword
She evades him and throws her robes up White Fire erupts
He falls back His men have thrown a chain around Diaval’s
claws They pull him down to stab at him

MALEFICENT
Now a bear

Diaval transforms into a BEAR It bellows and swipes at the
men They back away

INT THE TOWER ROOM - NIGHT 161
Aurora frantically looks for a way to release the wings She
picks up a heavy chair

INT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 162

Stefan throws a heavy iron chain at Maleficent It wraps
around her neck

She drops to her knees as it burns her Stefan pulls it
tighter She gasps The men have thrown a rope around the
bear’s legs hobbling him

INT THE TOWER ROOM - NIGHT 163
Aurora throws the chair at the coffin It hits the thick
glass but does not break it

INT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 164
Maleficent gasps out the words

MALEFICENT
Now a dragon

Diaval transforms into a DRAGON It breathes fire at the
men They fend off the fire with their shields

INT THE TOWER ROOM - NIGHT 165
Aurora hasn’t given up She tilts the coffin It falls
forward and crashes onto the floor The wings flap and
struggle in the broken glass

INT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 166
Stefan pulls the chain around Maleficent’s neck tighter She

gasps One of the men throws a sword at the dragon
Maleficent can barely get the words out

MALEFICENT
Now a butterfly

Diaval transforms into a butterfly The sword flies
harmlessly past him as he flutters away

INT THE TOWER ROOM - NIGHT 167

Aurora reaches out and softly touches Maleficent’s wings
They stop struggling

AURORA
Fly
INT THE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 168

Stefan’s men throw more heavy iron CHAINS around Maleficent
One wraps around her legs Another around her waist

They pull them tightly She crouches on the floor chains
across her body Tortured Stefan stands over her

He lifts his sword high over her prepared to make the fatal
blow But a brisk wind suddenly whips up from nowhere
Something large and black slams into him knocking him off
his feet Maleficent looks up

Her face fills with astonishment to see her long-lost wings
flying down toward her

Aurora runs into the room from the tower stairs

Overjoyed Maleficent lifts her arms out to her wings They
flutter down toward her

AURORA
Be one again

There’s an earth-shattering CRACK

Maleficent is enveloped in a MAGICAL explosion of LIGHT AND
ENERGY Then she rises into the air on her wings

Aurora’s face lights up The Pixies faces fall Stefan’s men
are just as astonished

STEFAN
Kill her Kill her

They attack her with swords and iron chains Maleficent
fights them from the air

Diaval fights at her side Stefan motions to his men They
gradually back Maleficent toward the open door to the
battlements

EXT STEFAN’S CASTLE - THE BATTLEMENTS 169

Maleficent fight them She knocks the last of the men away
There’s only Stefan now She corners him against the wall
with her wings

MALEFICENT
It would feel so good to kill you
But I’1l let you live for Aurora’s
sake

STEFAN
I won’t let you take her

MALEFICENT
I won’t take her She’1ll come of
her own free will And here’s a
little thing you don’t know about
her

She whispers in his ear He’s shocked by the revelation
While she’s close he secretly brandishes his knife and
tries to stab her

She backs away and lets herself fall backwards off the
battlement Stefan throws himself on top of her

EXT MIDAIR - NIGHT 170

They fall in the cup of Maleficent’s folded wings grappling
as she plummets toward the earth

She tries to throw him off But he clings to her fiercely
and tries to stab her with the knife The ground rises
rapidly up toward them They struggle He holds onto her
raising the knife The wind whistles past

STEFAN
I never loved you

Maleficent looks into his eyes as they fall

MALEFICENT
You’re a liar

She flips over suddenly Stefan loses his grip His face
fills with terror and he falls

Maleficent’s wings open at the last moment before she hits
the ground and she swoops into the sky

INT THE GREAT HALL - DAWN 171

Maleficent enters Aurora runs into her arms After a
moment Maleficent crouches to look into her eyes

MALEFICENT
There’s something I need to tell
you

AURORA

Oh Godmother I already know
On her back two tiny gossamer wings glitter in the light

CUT TO

EXT THE MOUND - NEAR DAWN 172

The Moorland Faeries winged and unwinged alike have
gathered on the faerie mound Maleficent steps onto the
Queen’s Stone with her guards around her The Stone screams
in protest She shouts

MALEFICENT
As you see I am not the rightful
Queen But the time has come for me
to step down

Maleficent steps down off the Stone It falls silent

MALEFICENT
Fair People of the Moors I give
you Queen Aurora

As dawn breaks the FAIRY QUEEN AURORA floats down from
above her wings fluttering softly

She lands on the Stone The Stone ROARS like a lion The
Faeries cheer Musicians play and the Faeries dance Aurora
sees Prince Phillip standing in the back of the crowd She
smiles Maleficent stands with Diaval the Man Her hand
finds his as they both struggle with their emotions

EXT THE FAERIE PATH —- THE NEXT DAY 173

The Pixies stop hesitantly at the faerie path Thistlewit
puts her hand out tentatively

THISTLEWIT
Are you certain

KNOTGRASS
Yes Queen Aurora has lifted the
Binding spell
THISTLEWIT
Come along Flittle We’re going
home
Flittle’s butterflies fly ahead Flittle hears something
She looks back A CARRIAGE approaches on the road The Blue
Woman leans out and points at Flittle

BLUE WOMAN
I’m coming for you

Flittle gasps and runs after them

CUT TO

EXT THE FARMLANDS - SOME TIME LATER 174

The land on both sides of the Faerie path is equally green
and verdant

The Farmer’s SON now fully grown and his collies herd the
sheep They approach the faerie path

The Farmer’s son throws down a glove The sheep trample it
in their hurry to graze on the sweet moorland grass

EXT THE MOORS - ON THE BLACKTHORN TREE - DAY 175
Maleficent and Diaval sit in the tree crunching black nuts

MALEFICENT
I wasn’t a very good queen was I

DIAVAL
You did what had to be done

MALEFICENT
Actually I was a bad queen

DIAVAL
Very bad In fact in my opinion
you were the the Mistress of all
Evil
She gives him an evil smile She takes off her Horned Crown

MALEFICENT
I won’t be needing this anymore

She takes it off and rubs the places on her head where the
horns rested

MALEFICENT
Ahhh

She hangs the crown on a tree limb

MALEFICENT
Time to fly

She waves her hand at him

MALEFICENT
Now a bird

He transforms into a RAVEN

DIAVAL
AWK

They lift their wings and take flight together

But before they get too far Maleficent swings around and
comes back toward the tree

She swoops low grabs the Horned Crown and flies off again
As Maleficent and the raven soar together wing-to-wing
above the beautiful moors fade out

THE END
