FADE IN
Snow flakes falling against a black sky
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM DOWNWARD TO REVEAL
EXT MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT
It looks like a warm cozy place out of Its A Wonderful
Life The window is flocked with fake snow and hung with
colorful Christmas lights wreaths and ornaments
CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN
DISSOLVE TO
INT MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT
CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT IN SAME DIRECTION

TITLES BEGIN

The barman wiping down the counter gives an occasional
semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar

Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional
glances toward the far end of the bar It is early evening --
happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable

A customer says something interrogative to the bartender
who looks down the bar and shrugs

REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination
of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santas head keep his face

from being clearly revealed in this scene)

Sitting alone at the far end of the bar given a wide berth
by the other customers a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into
his drink The drink is clearly not his first

He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white
pom-pom He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim His
long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below
his chin to facilitate drinking It exposes heavy black
stubble

Swaying slightly he raises the drink to the vicinity of his
lips Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some
effortful coordination He takes a sip and sets the drink
carefully back down
After another long staring morose beat he starts weeping
It is loud dolorous and unself-conscious
EXT ALLEYWAY BEHIND THE MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT
Santa staggers out the back door
CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face
Santa gets about ten feet then pauses and leans with one
hand against the alley wall uses the other to hold his pom-
pom out of the way and vomits
Having vomited and spit he staggers off toward the street

Coax a smile from the

(turning to face them)
Remember parents dont want photos

Some children may not want to smile

It is your job to coax a smile out

Santa thinks everybody should be
happy Can you smile for Santa A
camera can only copy a childs smile --
it will take you to put it there

TRAINER
If the child will not smile the
Photo Elf will go ahead and take the
picture anyway Now it is a good
Santas job to smile as well -- I

smile will be partially hidden so
you must learn to smile with your
eyes They show warmth and can be
very expressive

On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Malls parking lot a
city bus stops with a hiss The doors swing open to reveal a

dressed and probably smelling of pee

As the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older
children doing skateboard stunts They notice him

The bullies disheartened by the lack of reaction go back
to their skateboarding

INT BLACK ANGUS BAR - NIGHT

A large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened-tie
middle-management

Crammed at the far end of the bar Willie stands out like a
sore thumb in this thirty-ish crowd

We follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until
it connects with the drunken glowering face of a HINDUSTANI
TROUBLEMAKER sitting right across from him startling Willie
for a moment

Willie regains his composure then gives the guy a puzzled
look back and amused by the guys unflinching anger raises
his glass in a toast to him as if to say whatever cheers
you nutcase and turns back to his drink

The man stands up and never releasing his stare moves right
up to Willie two inches from his face Willie looks up

TROUBLEMAKER

EXT HILL NEAR SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - DAY

We are pulling an eight-year-old child who rides his bicycle
along the sidewalk looking off struck by what he sees

He slows and then comes to a stop having pulled even with a
group of other children gathered on the sidewalk also looking
off at the same spot They stare for a good long beat
expressions rather neutral But the sight whatever it is
holds their attention

Finally one in the foreground remarks

KID
I didnt know he did that

Their POV rather distant on a grassy hill a man in a Santa
suit is pounding the shit out of the bullies One of the
bullies throws a punch but Santa grabs his fist and pushes
him down Santa puts his foot on another bullys butt and
sends him flying After more wrestling and flinging about
the bullies wind up in a heap on the ground

him down

the hood

The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose several feet
apart as Gin opens the hood

GIN
(motions to his battery)
Help yourself small fry

Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery
terminals

MARCUS
Its hard for me to reach

Gin grabs the cables from him Marcus takes a few steps back

GIN
Jesus Christ give me those

MARCUS
Thanks

Gin attaches the cables

GIN
(then to Lois)
Alright TRY IT

Lois turns the key and the van starts right up Gin takes
the cables off the van and closes the hood He lights up a
Pall Mall

Marcus signals to Lois She puts the car into gear and stomps
her foot on the accelerator squashing Gin between the two
vehicles

ANGLE PROM INSIDE VAN (SLOW MOTION)

Gins face as its squooshed up against the vans windshield
A cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips

Lois continues to step on the gas trying to crush him
ANGLE ON the tires spinning in the gravel

Finally she takes her foot off the gas The van eases back

Gin falls to the ground with a groan Marcus steps up and
leans over him

MARCUS
Oh my what a terrible accident

LOIS
Is he dead

MARCUS
No but it looks like you broke most
of his ribs

Then leaning down to Gin

MARCUS
(for Gins benefit)
Id say maybe fifty percent of
them Or do you think thirty percent

LOIS
I needed more of a running start --
I couldnt build up any speed

Marcus paces around trying to figure out what to do next

MARCUS
(shaking his head in
dismay)
Motherfuck

He grabs the jumper cables still connected to Gins 4 X 4
and clamps the other ends on Gins ears A small jolt anda
spark or two Only a minor shock
MARCUS
Shit

He grabs Gins arm and with great effort drags him over a
few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front
tire of the van Gin tries to crawl out of the way

ANGLE ON Gins feet slipping on the gravel

MARCUS

ANGLE ON shift level moving into REVERSE

a wailing toddler on his lap Bubble gum is all over the
Kids face

He passes the child off to Marcus who holds it as Willie
gazes off and murmurs

WILLIE
Everything I touch turns to shit

Marcus still holding the child quickly glances around and
then hisses into Willies ear

MARCUS

What are you drinking Sterno now
Cause youre sounding like my Aunt
Tilly right before she smeared her
own shit on the bedroom walls and we
had to lock her up and she spent the
rest of her life with a shaved head
and eating lunch through a tube up
her nose

Willie continues to stare head swaying

Behind Jesse in Mens Wear is Lois wearing a frown of
pruney disapproval Seeing that hes not looking she

We PAN and WHIP-PIVOT along the outside of several lengths
of ductwork following the muffled SCREAM of a thousand
girlies echoing inside

The ductwork dimples out along the bottom with the WUBBA
sound of flopping aluminum as Marcuss weight travels its
length at turns Marcuss inertial force makes one side of

the duct momentarily dent out

We thus follow Marcuss progress as he slides bumps
ricochets and barrels through the department store

Marcus swings at the mannequins knees with a golf club
Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe

Marcus having chopped down the mannequin drags off its
stole

Willie is back over the safe battering it with the
sledgehammer roaring with each swing

Marcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots

Willie sweating drops the sledgehammer clanking to the
floor Wiping his forehead he circles the safe When he
gets to the back of the safe he stops thinks

Marcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo

Willie is hunched at the back of the safe stethoscope to
its surface giving exploratory taps with two knuckles

Sound perspective through the stethoscope hollow THUNKS
followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK

Willie reacts quizzically After a considering moment he
rises we can see on the far side of the safe its door as
it finishes creaking open

Marcus enters the room Willie looks at him

Marcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into
the Santa sack Willie wipes sweat off his forehead

behind a counter

Gunfire fills the air

Exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie
as the cops seek to put him down

Under the gunfire we hear Marcuss maniacal laughter
Willie reaches the end of the counter A brief open space
separates him from a stairwell he dashes across as gunfire
redoubles and plunges down the stairs

their cars just as Willie jumps from his

Willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door His
voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone

He bounds up the stoop

All right boys -- nail him

A ripple of gunfire

At the top of the stoop facing the door Willie staggers
rolls his eyes and -- drops

NEARBY WINDOW

Drawn by the noise an adorable six-year-old in a nearby
house slides open his second-story bedroom window to look

HIS HIGH POV

Frozen in a semi-circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn
an army of cops has guns trained on the felled Santa Claus
who is sprawled on the neighbors stoop motionless His
hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink
elephant un-delivered

The six year old draws in his breath and SCREAMS

He is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister
who look and SCREAM with him

Somewhere a neighborhood dog barks
A Cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children

COP
Somebody put a zipper on those fuckin
kids

FADE OUT
INT THE KIDS HOUSE - DAY
After a long beat Willies voice

WILLIE (VO)
Dear kid I hope that you got my
present and that there wasnt too
much blood on it although there was
blood on the present you gave me
which didnt keep me from enjoying
it so maybe the blood doesnt matter
so much I guess

We are FADING IN on a shelf in the Kids bedroom where the
stuffed elephant sits in a place of honor its fur indeed
stiff and stained with dried blood The Kids bedroom is no
longer in disarray things are neat and comfy We PAN OFF of
it to find this letter crudely handwritten tacked up ona
little bulletin board

WILLIE (VO)
-Anyway just in case they took it
as evidence I am also sending you a
T-shirt I hope its the right size
I am healing up good and they tell
me that I will soon be one hundred
percent even with eight bullets dug
out of me because they didnt hit
any vital organs just my liver which
is fucked anyway ha-ha-ha Anyways

Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom
and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room We TRACK
toward it

WILLIE (VO)
Thank you for giving that letter
to the cops I forgot I asked you to
do it but its a good thing you did
or Santas little helper wouldve
plugged his ass And now the cops
know I wrote it which is gonna keep
my ass out of jail That plus
everyone agreeing that the Phoenix
police department shooting an unarmed
Santa was even more fucked-up than
Rodney King The cops are treating
me like fucking royalty now which is
new in my experience They are gonna
make me a sensitivity counselor so
that tragedies like this will never
again embarrass the whole fucking
department Whatever

Grandma is in the living room watching TV We TRACK past her
towards the Jacuzzi area

WILLIE
-As for my little helper I am
sorry to have to tell you that him
and his prune-faced mail-order-wife
are gonna be exploring mountains
with your dad I hope your dad doesnt
go sucking shit from them like I
did Meanwhile I told the cops you
had no one to take the fuck care of
you so they set it up with Mrs
Santas sister watching you till
your Dad gets back in one year and
three months They made her a Guardian
Pro-Temp or some such shit anyway
she makes better money than bartending
and seems to like you and your house
and Jacuzzi

Sue is in a towel holding a highball as she climbs out of
the Jacuzzi The Kid walks by her carrying a bucket She
tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by Hes never
looked better

WE TRACK TOWARDS THE FOYER Its empty but the front door is
open We TRACK towards it

We go out the front door

WILLIE (VO)
So Ill be staying in Phoenix
