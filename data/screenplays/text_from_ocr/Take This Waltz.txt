INT MARGOT’S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON 1

Nouvelle Vagues Loungey version of This is Not A Love Song
plays on the stereo as Margot 28 mixes muffin batter It’s
sweltering hot She wipes sweat from her forehead She pours
the batter into a muffin tin very carefully She puts the
tin in the oven

Margot switches on the oven light She bends down to look at
the muffins rising The shadow of a man passes her He walks
to the window at the back of the kitchen and stands there We
see only his outline out of focus in the back of the frame
Margot sits down on the floor beside the oven Leans her
head and rests it on the oven door lit by the warm glow of
the light The muffins rise She watches them the expression
on her face a curious mixture of peace yearning
contentmentand longing The man puts his hand on the window
Shafts of light fall on the floor

The song plays over this and the next scene
This is not a love song This is not a love song

Im adaptable and I like my new role Im getting better and
better I have a new goal Im changing my ways where money
applies this is not a love song

This is not a love song This is not a love song
INT MARGOT’S BEDROOM -— LATE AFTERNOON 2

Well choreographed familiar sex We watch Margot and her
husband Lou make love There’s a certain routine about it
Occasionally Margot seems distracted Seems to be thinking
too much about the movements Lou is on top of her She tries
to maneouver him onto his back He isn’t picking up on her
intention

MARGOT
Maybe we could-

LOU
What

MARGOT

Let me get on top

LOU
Oh Okay

They awkwardly roll into position She starts fucking him

energetically He looks weirdly uncomfortable She becomes
self conscious They both do She slows down

(CONTTNURFD )

He moves her back onto her back Goes back to what he was
doing It’s enjoyable but slightly self conscious for both
of them

INT MARGOT’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 3

Margot lies on her side naked We see the blurry shape of
Lou behind her She is sweaty Lou rolls onto his back

MARGOT
This morning when I was lying on
the deck I looked up and there
were about twenty seagulls circling
above me

LOU
We’re close to the lake

MARGOT
Not that close I looked around and
there weren’t any others in the
sky Maybe something was dead

LOU
You would have smelled it wouldn’t
you

MARGOT
There weren’t any others in the
sky

LOU

Maybe they thought you were dead

MARGOT
Yeah

He gets up and goes to the bathroom She listens to the sound
of him peeing

MARGOT (CONTD)
I should check on the muffins

EXT TORONTO STREETS - MAGIC HOUR 4
Credits over this sequence

Fire by Jason Collett plays as Margot leaves her house and
walks along College St She walks through Little Portugal
Little Italy up to Little Korea She looks in many windows

stares at many passing faces She seems to be looking for
something Or nothing in particular

(CONTTNURFD )

I know you just want to be on fire

Jam radio Jam down to the pilot station

Broadcast enough through the flowered cracks in the

Margot is fully dressed A suitcase ready to go beside her
She puts her hand on Lou’s side He smiles as he slowly opens
his eyes Strokes her hair paternally She uses a strange
“baby voice” with him here As though she’s two or three
years old He seems unperturbed Responds in kind with a very
paternal voice

winding through lush fields with wildflowers and a view of

couples with cameras around their necks A calm soothing
female narrator plays over the ride through the bus speaker
The landscape is breathtakingly beautiful

WOMANS VOICE
The Fortress of Louisbourg National
Historic Site was once a busy
fortified seaport From its
founding by the French in 1713 to
its abandonment by the British in
1768 Louisbourg was a place of
profound significance in the Franco-
British struggle for empire During
its heydey Louisbourg was the
administrative capital of French
holdings in Atlantic Canada a
military stronghold and naval base
to protect French interests in the
region and an Anglo-French
battleground in both 1745 and 1758
Each summer the Fortress springs to
life as dozens of costumed
animators become the towns
residents of the summer of 1744
Youll see engineers musicians
soldiers merchants street
vendors bakers servants and
fisherman Watch demonstrations of
dance music cooking gardening
musketry and more

(CONTTNURFD )

The weird tourists cheer The soldier begins lashing him The

chatter contentedly about their separate days

LOU
So are you going to make the
changes

MARGOT

Yeah I dont know I shouldnt get
so attached to the wording anyway

Its just a stupid pamphlet Maybe

if I spin my wheels for a bit they

wont even notice

LOU
You cant get away with that in
cookbooks

MARGOT
Why cause people are smarter

LOU
Maybe just less distracted If you
take out the chicken People notice
youre not making chicken

(CONTTNURFD )

MARGOT
Thats possible Did you get a lot
done today

LOU
Not as much as I should have Im
getting kind of restless Its too

should do something else as well

LOU
Like what

MARGOT
Like something you enjoy

LOU

Like what

Margot shrugs He smiles at her She laughs

LOU (CONTD)

Youre projecting Whats the big
deal So you keep the job which

more money to eventually take the
time to write your novel

MARGOT
Can you give me an ETA on
eventually

Lou snuggles up behind her

LOU
You are an impatient person

He takes it back

SETH

No I should go

She stands there rocking back and forth in the doorway He
takes a seat

SETH (CONTD)
Why dont you sit down

Margot gets nervous Changes the subject

MARGOT
So youre an artist

SETH

pay my rent through the hauling of
a rickshaw on city streets like a
modern day hobo

MARGOT
Do you show your stuff anywhere

(CONTTNURFD )

54 54

SETH
Oh I should add to that I paint
for myself and I pay my rent

gage it by - I have great
instincts

MARGOT
I remember when Tony my niece was

a newborn
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

54 54
MARGOT (CONTD)

And when Id babysit sometimes
shed cry - like babies do and Id
do everything I could to identify
the source of the problem Was she
hungry Was she tired Did she have
a rash 9 times out of 10 I could
solve the problem and figure it
out But sometimesI dont know
Sometimes Im walking along the
street and a shaft of sunlight
falls a certain way across the
pavement and I just want to cry
And a second later its over I
decide since Im an adult to not
succumb to thismomentary
melancholy Sometimes I thought
with Tony that she just had a
moment like this A moment of not
knowing why or how and she let
herself go into it And there was
nothing anyone could do to make it
better It was just her and the
fact of being alive colliding

Seth thinks about this for a bit
SETH
Or maybe you just didnt figure out
what it was

Margot nods to herself a bit deflated

MARGOT
Yeah I suppose thats possible

She gets up to leave
MARGOT (CONTD)
Well I guess Ill run into you

again

Seems inevitable

She leaves Seth sits for a while thinking

the same direction

INT YMCA GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON 64

Margot takes part in an absurdly embarrassing Muscleworks
class in the gym Around the top of the gym there is a
running track where joggers run around overhead An
overzealous Jamaican woman leads the class as they make asses
of themselves Twirling hoolahoops doing sad little aerobic
dance routines Margot is quite self conscious - but thank
god no one is watching - until of course she looks up and
sees Seth in his street clothes walking the length of the
jogging track overhead watching her He looks down at her
almost analytically pondering her idiocy She looks up -
humiliated beyond belief and sputters a laugh He just shakes
his head She continues on with the class the instructor
getting more and more energetic and demanding She cant help
stealing glances up to him though as he passes her overhead
going around and around her overhead gaining speed he
begins doing an impression of an overzealous jogger From
Margots POV We pan around as he circles us She begins to
laugh crazily getting looks from the other participants in
the class At some point she actually becomes hysterical and
makes her way in gales of laughter out of the class

(CONTTNURFD )

64

He watches her go Stays there and waits for her to come
back watching the gym from the track She appears behind
him up on the track screaming and laughing

MARGOT
Asshole

She runs at him He gives chase and they run around the track
together her chasing him both laughing their heads off The
Muscleworks class watches in astonishment hoolahoops dropped
around their ankles

EXT STREET - AFTERNOON 65
Margot walks ahead of Seth Shes still bright red laughing

SETH
Youre misinterpreting I was
admiring your form

MARGOT
My form You were admiring my form

hoolahoop It was awe inspiring

She whacks him with her back

MARGOT
I fucking hate you more than anyone
else Ive ever met in my fucking
life

Well - while i hate the cussing - I
concur - that I hate you pretty
thouroughly as well

66

They both look down Smiling Seth looks up at Margot
looking down She looks adorable

MARGOT (CONTD)
I just said that

SETH
You just said that

He takes a deep breath

SETH (CONT’D)
I just kissed the top of your head
ever so gently

She looks up meets his gaze

MARGOT
You did

SETH
Yes And then I kissed your
eyelids And they fluttered
underneath my lips Just a little

MARGOT
A little

SETH
And slowly very very slowly I
just grazed your lips with mine
But because youre married I didnt
dare kiss them

MARGOT
No

SETH
No Instead I worked my way slowly
down your neck and I kissed every
inch of it and I lingered over
your birthmark on your left
shoulder

Margot glances at her birthmark

SETH (CONTD)
Yes That one And I kissed every
inch of your neck and your
shoulders and I smelled you I
really inhaled and I smelled you

(CONTTNURFD )

66 66

MARGOT
What did I smell like

SETH
You smelled like you do The way
you smelled on the plane The way
you smell right now A mixture of
sweetness and fuck

MARGOT
Hmm

SETH
And I kissed your breasts ever so
gently And I licked your nipples
And I spent about an hour there
and I was gentle at first but I
found out how they worked and you
werent all that interested in me
being gentle

MARGOT
No

SETH
No

MARGOT
No

SETH

So then I thought to myself I need
to find out how she works How
every part of her works And I
spent about a week and a half with
your body and I began to learn and
know it Every detail of it I
played with you and figured out how
you worked before I entered you
Before I spread your legs and
fucked you hard and loved you

MARGOT
Right

(CONTTNURFD )

SETH
Right I fucked you harder than I
wanted to but I couldnt help
myself and I pulled your hair
gently while I rocked inside you
and I fucked your mouth and every
part of you until we were both so
intensely fevered we couldnt see
straight and I filled you with my

cum and I told you again and again

that I love you I love you

They stare at each other shocked For a long time And then
Margot begins to laugh Very hard And so does Seth

MARGOT
So these martinis

SETH
Redundant I think

MARGOT

Okay Well Im going to leave some
money And then Im going to leave

And Im going home to clean myself
up

SETH
Okay

He lights a smoke and watches her while she pulls some money
out of her wallet very fumbly and plunks it down on the

table

MARGOT
One thing

SETH
Yes

MARGOT

Because none of this is actually
going to happen - can I make an
appointment with you

SETH
What kind of appointment

MARGOT

She grabs her purse dropping it on the floor She picks it
up bright red with embarrassment He watches her go

INT MARGOTS BATHROOM - AFTERNOON 67

his hand

INT MARGOTS LIVINGROOM - AFTERNOON 68

pamphlet on Fort York to write

LOU

MARGOT

INT FORT YORK 70

Margot goes on a tour of the Armoury of Fort York A tour
guide drones on Margot makes notes distractedly

TOUR GUIDE
Fort York was build by the British
Army and Canadian troops in the
late 1700s and early 1800s to
defend the settlement and the new
capital of the Upper Canada region
from the threat of military attack
principally from the newly
independent United States During
the war of 1812 on April 27 1813
combined US Army and naval forces
attacked York from Lake Ontario
overrunning Fort York As the
British abandoned the fort they
set the powder magazine to blow up
killing and wounding several
hundred US soldiers

Margot wanders off We follow her as she makes her way out of
the Fort over a green field and into surprisingly - city
traffic She looks through the traffic confused and thinking

EXT MARGOTS HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 71

72 INT YMCA LOCKER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 72

Geraldine Margot and Karen all get changed into their
bathing suits Margot is nervous

(CONTTNURFD )

72

MARGOT
Is it embarrassing

GERALDINE
Of course its embarrassing Its
aquafit

KAREN
It shouldnt even feel like a
workout until youre in your mid
seventies And none of us will be
able to walk in the morning

MARGOT
God Its embarrassing isnt it

GERALDINE
Its only old women seeing you And
whoever walks by the glass

MARGOT
Theres glass What glass

CUT TO
INT POOL - MORNING 73

There is a large panel of glass where people entering the
YMCA can look directly into the aquafit class Margot in the
pool with Geraldine and Karen stares at it with a sense of
forboding And the music begins and its the worst music in
the world and the fabulously queenie aquafit instructor
begins barking very enthusiastic instructions

AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR
Okay people Are we ready
Were going to rock Start
walking Thats right Start
walking in a circle

The class moves through the water at a snails pace making
big walking motions underwater

AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)

And get your arms into it Say
YEAH

CLASS
Yeah

AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR
Say YEAH

(CONTTNURFD )

73 73

CLASS
YEAH

AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR
I cant hear you

CLASS
YEAH

The older ladies giggle Margot cant believe whats
happening and the walking circle is taking her away from the
glass so she keeps anxiously turning to make sure Seth isnt
there The aquafit instructor gets more and more animated
the motions more and more ridiculous Margot makes a face at
Geraldine and Karen who shrug back at her

AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR

Okay stop where you are now Lean
against the wall And KICK KICK
KICK

The class wildly kick their legs creating a shower of spray
Margot can barely see now - though she is facing the glass at
this point Through the spray she makes out the unmistakable
figure of Seth staring in at her trying not to laugh and
not succeeding at all

AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
And arms in circles arms in
circles

Margot half heartedly does the motion glances at Geraldine
and Karen who are not looking in the direction of Seth As
the aquafit instructor gets more and more intense and
animated Margot begins to laugh and seeing Seth laugh
becomes uncontrollable Shes beginning to attract attention
as she desperately tries to continue the exercises despite
the shrieking laughter that keeps escaping from her This
starts to make Geraldine and Karen laugh also Geraldine
briefly follows Margots gaze to see Seth there and then
looks back to see Margot blushing wildly in the middle of her
laughter She clocks this By this point Margot has made a
scene Karen is now laughing her head off too

AQUAFIT INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
Okay honey try to focus

Margot sidles up to Geraldine
MARGOT

Oh God Oh God I think Im going
to pee

(CONTTNURFD )

GERALDINE

Dont Dont They put the stuff in
the water here - it turns colour

MARGOT
Oh no

A cloud of purple ripples its way around Margot indicating
the generous dispersal of her urine The older ladies shake
their heads a few get out of the pool Karen and Geraldine
help Margot out the three of them laughing insanely Margot

looks back to catch Seths eyes He shakes his head

disapprovingly She gives him the finger Geraldine clocks

this once again

INT YMCA LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

Karen Margot and Geraldine take showers

KAREN
Well it was worth a try

MARGOT

Im so sorry Oh my god Im so

fucking sorry

GERALDINE

It will be extremely difficult for
me to refrain from sending a mass e-

mail about this

MARGOT
Fuck you

KAREN

Well at least we got a good workout

for our stomach muscles

MARGOT

You guys didnt have to come with
me You could have finished the

class

GERALDINE

Margot - I love you Not enough to

bathe in your urine

They laugh For a few moments they are silent as they go
about the business of female grooming Shaving washing
exfoliating We get a good peek around the rest of the shower
area where women of all shapes and sizes enter into their own

private world of washing themselves

(CONTTNURFD )

GERALDINE (CONTD)
I sometimes wonder if theres any
point to shaving my legs Im
pretty certain James wouldnt
notice either way I sometimes
wonder who Im doing it for

KAREN
Married life

GERALDINE
Yeah Its kind of depressing But
sometimes I think to myself - after
10 years no man would probably
take a really active interest in
whether I shaved my legs or not
And at least after all this time I
still really like James So would
it be worth trading that in for
something exciting with someone I
might not like in 10 years I dont
know

Margot looks up at Geraldine Geraldine looks right back at
her knowingly Margot looks down feeling shes been

caughtAn OLDER WOMAN in her 60s who is showering
them listens in

KAREN
Sometimes Id just like something
new though New things are shiny

OLDER WOMAN
New things get old

GERALDINE
Yeah Thats right New things get
old Just like the old things did

A group of older women enter the shower area naked

next to

and begin

washing and gossiping The younger women steal glances at

them at their bodies
EXT YMCA - MORNING

KAREN

GERALDINE

me Makes me want to drink

KAREN

GERALDINE
Youre telling me

Margot is not paying attention Shes anxiously looking to
see if Seth is there When she finds that the coast is
definitely clear she feels oddly disappointed She joins into
the conversation with Karen and Geraldine

EXT MARGOTS HOUSE - MORNING 76

Margot is about to enter her house She pauses looks back
towards Seths apartment She sees a light is on She takes a
moment trying to make herself go into her own house but
unable to She begins a slow painful walk of shame across
the street every part of her knowing better She arrives at
his door and inhales Knocks The door opens - painfully
slowly Seth appears Tries to keep a straight face They
both begin laughing so hard theyre crying

(CONTTNURFD )

76

SETH
Thank you Thank you Ive never
seen a woman pee so early ina

She smacks him and he backs into the apartment
INT SETHS BASEMENT APARTMENT - MORNING 77

Seth stands in the middle of the livingroom Margot has beat
him back into the middle of the room Teddy Thompsons Shine
So Bright plays on Seths stereo

SETH
Excellent I got you into my
apartment All it took was a
healthy beating So Tell me the
history of my country Starting
with the fortresses

MARGOT
You are By far The worst person I
have ever known

Seth looks right at her So tenderly As though shes just
told him she loves him He sits on one end of the couch She
watches him for a long beat She sits at the far end away
from him They are silent

MARGOT (CONTD)
So

SETH
So

MARGOT
Theres this then

SETH
Absolutely There is this Find me
aman to deny it

They are silent again Margot lifts the white blanket off the
back of the couch and throws it over them She stays at her
end of the couch and throws her feet up So does he They
stare at each other under the blanket far apart not
touching The light is soft and gorgeous as it pours through
the white fabric

MARGOT
I made a fort

(CONTTNURFD )

77

SETH
So you did

Margot slowly ever so slowly reaches out her fingers into
the space between them He watches them then slowly ever so
slowly reaches out his fingers to slowly meet hers in the
space He doesnt quite touch them His fingers are a
millimeter away from hers She looks at him He raises his
eyebrows as if to say he wont do anything more She touches
the tips of his fingers Its an explosion They stare at
each other breathing hard They ever so tentatively explore
each others hands They run their fingers along each others
turn their hands over etc There is never the threat of it
going further than this Just a thorough almost unbearably
explosive exploration of each others fingers They are lit
by the sunlight filtered through the thin white blanket which
shrouds them

Margot takes a long breath

MARGOT
I should go

SETH
Yeah

MARGOT
Bye

SETH
Bye

They stare at each other for ages Finally Seth whips the
blanket off them Margot startled by the return to the real
light the real room steals her hand back quickly She wipes
it on her jeans leaves the apartment

INT MARGOTS HOUSE - MORNING 78

Margot sighs
INT MARGOTS KITCHEN - MORNING 79

Lou cooks up a storm Theres a lot of vigour in him when
hes cooking Margot enters the kitchen and watches him for a
while Full of guilt but also very stimulated from her
encounter with Seth She comes up behind him kisses the back
of his neck as he stirs

LOU
I put hot peppers in it this time
What do you think itll be like
with hot peppers
She keeps kissing him

MARGOT
I dont care

Hes a bit miffed by this

LOU
Thanks

She begins kissing his arms his biceps Hes not sure what
to do with this

LOU (CONT’D)
Kay careful though Ill splatter
tomato sauce all over

Margot takes a moment Hearing his evasive tone She is
stung Starts to walk out of the room

LOU (CONT’D)
Where are you going What

She turns back to face him her face full of tears

MARGOT
Do you know - it takes courage to
do that

LOU
To what

(CONTTNURFD )

79 79

MARGOT
To seduce you It takes all my
courage And youre teaching me to
be completely and utterly without

bravery

LOU
It takes courage to seduce your
husband

MARGOT
Yes It takes all the courage in
the world

LOU

Thats ridiculous

MARGOT
Is it Then why do you always prove
that I was right - when I feel Im
taking a great risk - you
consistently prove to me that I was
right And that it was a bigger
risk than I could manage

He looks at her dumbfounded
LOU
What The fuck Are you talking
about

They stare at each other

LOU (CONTD)
Im just making chicken

Margot cries

MARGOT
Youre always just making chicken

She walks out of the room He throws down his cooking utensil
and stares helplessly at the cacciatore

80 INT MARGOTS BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 80

moving across her face

EXT MARGOTS HOUSE - NIGHT 81

Margot goes out onto the porch Stares at Seths house She
yells back into the house

street He follows her maintaining a distance They walk
through the city streets this way she is aware of him
following her he never tries to catch up

INT STREETCAR -NIGHT 82

Margot and Seth ride in silence Seth behind her in the
streetcar Its night and College St is alive and well
patios crowded music drifting by They watch the street pass
by them charged by this silent game

SETH

MARGOT
Its good and empty

INT POOL - NIGHT 83

Margot goes to the end of the very empty pool area Seth
appears and stays at the closer end The Y is empty at this
time of night the pool room is a stunning royal blue in the
darkness They stare at each other from opposite sides Then
dive in Underwater they swim past each other snake around
each other but never quite touch Its magical their eyes
are wide underneath the water staring at each other trying
to contain big laughter Seth dives deep and grabs Margots
ankle playfully She panics and quickly surfaces

MARGOT
I have to get out

Margot climbs out of the pool Seth stays in the water
treading water

SETH
Afraid of being afraid

She dries herself off Looks back at him

MARGOT
Sorry It was a bad idea

(CONTTNURFD )

83

SETH
It was a great idea It was a bad
ending

She shrugs Mad at herself She leaves Seth dives under the

water He pushes himself off from the shallow end and glides
through the water watching the bottom fall away from him as

he enters the deep end

INT MARGOTS KITCHEN - NIGHT 84

Margot enters the kitchen her hair wet She sits down at the
table The stereo is blasting Mazzy Star She watches the
many pots of chicken boiling on the stove She puts her head
in her hands looks up to see Lou outside on the back stoop
smoking She watches him sways a bit to the music sings
softly to herself Lou finally looks up and sees her From
his point of view the scene is totally silent Her lips
moving silently her head swaying to an unheard tune He
smiles at her She smiles back She goes to the glass and
kisses it He opens the door takes her in his arms They
make love on the kitchen floor

LATER
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 85
Lou turns down the burner pours out some cacciatore onto a
big plate of rice He hands it to Margot who is still on the
floor naked and wrapped in a blanket
LOU

juices and feed you to the dogs

MARGOT
Gross

She takes a bite of the chicken

MARGOT (CONTD)

LOU

like swimming

He holds her while she eats She looks endlessly relieved

EXT STREET - EVENING

Margot is leaving the house She walks down the street

Glances casually towards Seths apartment To her relief and
her disappointment he isnt there She keeps walking As she
rounds the corner she sees him coming home with his rickshaw

MARGOT (CONT’D)
The house always smells good and

pretty gross

A cab pulls up from the opposite direction It stops Lou
waves out the window as he pays the driver

LOU

gets out of the cab

running with them down the street Margot cant help but
watch his body as it pulls the weight of the rickshaw

EXT STREETS - EVENING 87

Seth has picked up the pace Lou grabs Margots hand kisses
her cheek Margot tries to return but it feels so strange
with Seth right there Seth occasionally steals a glance back
at them He begins doing tricks jumping in the air so the
whole thing tilts backwards Margot gasps Lou laughs Seth
looks back and smiles Margot starts to feel really nervous
He is going faster and faster

EXT CINEMATHEQUE - EVENING 88

washing machine downstairs

Margot thinks for a bit

(CONTTNURFD )

Geraldine

MARGOT
Its just you know that thing
that happens I guessthis
incredible man that I
metLouwho was so magical who

is now inextricably linked to the
sound of the washing machine

GERALDINE (CONTD
Its nothing to be ashamed of Its
just life It doesnt mean theres
anything wrong with either of you
It happens in relationships People

Margot lets out a wry laugh

They ride

MARGOT
I dont take it personally But

looked at me when we first met

GERALDINE
How did he look at you
MARGOT
He justnever didnt look at me
GERALDINE

mind is being read

EXT MARGOTS HOUSE - DAWN

street

EXT LAKESHORE - DAWN

Margot walks down the boardwalk Looking to see if she can
find Seth Doesnt see him Sits down and hugs her knees into
her chest Looks at the water In the distance she sees a
guy with a rickshaw heading her way The sun glares behind

his figure as he gets closer

SETH

A long pause

SETH
Is that what you came here to tell
me That you love your husband and
your anniversary was okay Why
was it okay

Margot sighs

(CONTTNURFD )

MARGOT
Because Im terrified to go out to
dinner with him

SETH
More or less terrified of dinner
than changing planes

MARGOT
Same Its the same fear Im
terrified we wont have anything to
say to each other And then because
Im so terrified theres no way to
have a normal conversation
Everything just gets so incredibly
silent inside me

She looks up at him

MARGOT (CONT’D)
I feel there is no greater betrayal
than complaining about your husband
to your

Seth raises his eyebrows

SETH
To your what

Margot quickly changes direction

MARGOT
So you know a bit about my life
now What about you I want to know
something about you

SETH
Ask away

Seth laughs

MARGOT (CONTD)

Seth looks pissed off

SETH
What elegant insight

MARGOT
Well isnt that the truth

SETH
I just said that I only had one
relationship and it was a long time
ago

Margot looks surprised

MARGOT
You didnt say one There was
only one

SETH
Yeah

He looks directly at her It causes him pain to talk about
this

SETH (CONT’D)
Okay You want the sob story I was
in love once It was up north in
Cobalt where I grew up And I loved
her since we were six years old
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

93 93
SETH (CONTD)

And we were going to spend the rest
of our lives together For my whole
childhood all of highschool
everything I cant ever remember
not holding her hand There was
never a second when we imagined a
future that wasnt built around the
two of us And then one day she
just stopped talking to me Just
stopped Id loved her for my whole
life and one day she justwent
silent

He breaks his tone

SETH (CONTD)
And Ive been milking that sucker
of a story ever since

MARGOT
Why

SETH
Attention - Good attention Bad
attention I like attention

MARGOT
No Why did she stop talking to
you
Seth shrugs Smiles
SETH

I Dont Know

MARGOT

Youd think so wouldnt you

Margot furrows her brow

MARGOT
She just stopped talking to you
altogether With no explanation
Did you ask her Did you even try
to find out

SETH
What do you think I phoned her
five times a day

(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD ) 93
SETH (CONTD)
I followed her everywhere begging
her pleading her to tell me what I
had done to hurt her so terribly I
mean I must have hurt her
terribly I wrote letter after
letter And then one day I just
left And I never went back And I
never put myself in that position
again

MARGOT
What position You mean falling in
love You never put yourself in the
position of falling in love

SETH
Why would I Id have to be insane
after that
MARGOT
Why It was just one person
SETH
No it was if I loved someone so

much and I hurt them so

badlyand Is
whyHow could

till dont know

afraid of commitment as you so
elegantly put it What insight

MARGOT
Im sorry

They sit in silence

MARGOT (CONTD)
Whywhy are you this way with me
then Youre so forward You
dont seem like you dont trust
yourself

SETH

Because something in your face just
made me want to start speaking to
someone again I suddenly wasnt
terrified of what would come out of
my mouth And it feels easy And it
feels impossibly beautiful And I
do

MARGOT
You do what

(CONTTNURFD )

SETH

Margot smiles Seth stands up suddenly

In time for what

Two beautiful teenage girls walk by Margot watches them

MARGOT
Its such an injustice you know
You walk around at that age with
the most superficial sense of your
sexuality You think you get it
You do get it enough to play games
But you dont really get it at all
And then finally you begin to get
a sense of what it means you start
to feel what it means to be inside
your body and suddenly youre not
forbidden fruit anymore

SETH
So

MARGOT
So thats unjust

SETH
I guess if you want to be
forbidden fruit If thats the end
goal I dont find that all that
interesting

(CONTTNURFD ) 94

MARGOT
Yeah right

SETH
I find you interesting I find you
really interesting

Margot blushes She is so attracted to him she could scream
An endless pause

MARGOT
Its hard not toHave you ever
been on the scrambler at centre
island

Seth tilts his head

SETH

MARGOT
Its in the dark and they play
music and it goes way too fast to
do anything stupid

SETH
Okay

INT CENTRE ISLAND SCRAMBLER - DAY 95

Margot and Seth get buckled into a car in the scrambler It
is dark there are strobe lights We hear the opening
deceivingly soft strains of Video Killed the Radio Star
The ride starts deceivingly slowly Margot and Seth stare at
each other from opposite sides of the car As it speeds up
Margot is whipped over to Seths side of the car It gets
extremely fast Because of the dark and the intermittent
strobe lights other peoples faces are lit up just when it
looks like youre about to crash into their cart Margot
screams with elation puts her arms out They laugh
hysterically seeing kids faces flash by them Another couple
makes out passionately one guy rides alone a huge grin on
his face They steal glances at each other but mostly just
yell with joy as the ride whips them maniacally around

EXT TORONTO ISLAND FERRY - SUNSET 96

Seth and Margot head back to the city We see the Toronto
skyline at sunset in front of them

MARGOT

SETH
Oh really

MARGOT
Whats that supposed to mean

SETH
Youre not having an affair

MARGOT
I dont remember your dick slipping
into me on the scrambler unless Im
mistaken

SETH
Is that what having an affair is

Margot looks out at the skyline Ponders this

MARGOT
Ill say I went to the island to go
on the scrambler

SETH
By yourself

MARGOT
I wont specify

SETH
Wouldnt the idea of you going
alone to go on a kids ride be a
little unbelievable

MARGOT
No I do that whenever Im sad

(CONTTNURFD ) 96

SETH
Are you sad

MARGOT
Maybe a little bit Yeah How about

SETH
Maybe a little bit Maybe a little
bit happier than ever as well

She looks at him Exposing for a moment everything

MARGOT
This is sadlarious

Seth smiles He reaches out to touch Margots hand She pulls
it away Stands slightly apart from him He looks out at the
water Frustrated

EXT MARGOTS STREET - NIGHT 97
Seth and Margot walk together silently towards their homes

As they reach Seths apartment Margot turns to him to say
goodbye

pass each other Lou kisses her forehead or squeezes her
hand

CUT TO
INT MARGOTS HOUSE - NIGHT 100

A large boistrous crowd is packed into Margots house
Geraldine makes a speech from the stairs

GERALDINE
So the great thing about not
getting totally absorbed into the
AA community is that you still have
friends and family who will throw
you a huge drunken party to
celebrate your sobriety Its
totally inappropriate and its
really awesome So I raise my glass
of Perrier to all of you who can
still get shitfaced without guilt
to my amazing brother and sister-in-
law for getting me more than just a
piece of sober cake and to my
amazing kids who arent here
tonight for putting up with the
worst years And to my amazing
husband for trusting me enough to
be around you drunken idiots

Drunken hooting and hollering from the crowd Lots of
clapping The music turns on and people go back to dancing
Margot dances with a bunch of friends to Leonard Cohens

INT MARGOTS HOUSE - NIGHT 102

Margot dances with a partner to Closing Time There are a lot
of good dancers here I swear it happened just like this a
sigh a cry a hungry kiss Seth watches her as she
disappears and reappears between people For a moment her
hands become free as she twirls around Seth walks towards
her and grabs her hands and spins her around She is
extremely thrown She gives him a look of what are you doing
here He shrugs They continue to dance becoming less self
conscious as the song goes on Transfixed by each others
movements the physical proximity and the ease with which
they move together But the boss dont like these dizzy
heights were busted in the blinding lights Margot looks
around self consciously No one seems to have noticed

MARGOT
Um Can I get you a drink
SETH
Yup
They pass Lou
MARGOT

Oh Did you say hi to Lou

LOU

Margot roots around in a bin for a beer for Seth He lights
up a cigarette

MARGOT
Interesting choice

SETH
I tried not to come He was pretty
persistent

MARGOT
Something tells me you could have
found a way

Seth sits down on the deck sighs

SETH
Ive been thinking about that
airport fear of yours Of being in
between things I think I kind of
hate it too I know its kind of
the nature of being alive But Id
like to avoid it wherever possible
I dont think I want to be in
between things

He looks at her directly Margot has a moment of fear at what
he might be saying She brushes it off

MARGOT
I should get back to the party
Feel free to stay as long as you
like

(CONTTNURFD )

He takes one last look at her Tears roll down both of their
faces Then he gets in the van and drives away leaving her
staring after him Staggered We see Lou in the bedroom
window watching her

INT MARGOTS BEDROOM - DAWN 110

Lou is in bed staring at the ceiling He closes his eyes as
he hears her climb the stairs He pretends to be asleep
Margot climbs into bed next to him She puts the postcard on
her bulletin board She watches Lou for a while Strokes his
face tenderly She stares at the postcard on the wall She
closes her eyes In pain

CUT TO

INT CAPE BRETON BED AND BREAKFAST - AFTERNOON 111

We hear the song Dont Forget About Me by Micah P Hinson
play over the next several scenes

We see the back of the head of a woman in her forties
Streaks of grey in her hair She sits at a mirror brushing
her hair carefully We dont see her face She slowly rises
and we follow her always staying behind her We know this is
Margot but she walks as though she is older and years have
passed We follow her out of the small hotel down a long
road We begin to recognize the image from the post card We
see her figure grow smaller as we stay in position and she
keeps walking towards the entrance to the Cabot Trail We see
the shape of a man who we recognize as Seth moving slowly
towards her We watch them slowly cross the stunningly
beautiful landscape towards each other As they approach each
other their pace slows When they reach each other they take
a long moment taking the other in Its been a long time
They slowly move towards each other and their lips meet

INT MARGOTS BEDROOM 112

Margots eyes snap open She breathes hard shaken by the
dream Stares at the postcard We continue to hear Dont
Forget About Me over

CUT TO
INT MARGOTS BEDROOM 113

Margot has clearly just told Lou about Seth They sit bolt
upright on opposite sides of the bed Looking off into space
In their own worlds Lou looking shocked trying to puzzle it
through Margot looking guilt ridden and sad

INT MARGOTS KITCHEN 114

Lou sits at the table The music swells over his face as he
watches Margot off camera His face registers shock
sadness anger We see his response to her telling him she is
in love with Seth in a series of jump cuts In these scenes
we should get the sense that hours are passing the light
changing We are hearing snippets from an endless
conversation An emotional disaster We only hear the
occasional word or sentence

Lou looks at us stunned shakes his head

TIME CUT

Lou looks down fuming with anger

(CONTTNURFD )

114 114
TIME CUT
Lou looks up at her as if to ask if he has failed her

LOU
When did When

LOU (CONT’D)
I want to plead with you Should I
plead with you I dont know what

Lou stares at Margots face Realizing something
LOU (CONTD)
Id just be humiliating myself If
I begged you to stay Its true
isnt it

He can see by the look on her face that she has made up her
mind

TIME CUT
Lou laughs
TIME CUT

Lou sobs uncontrollably Margots hand comes into frame to
touch him he slaps it away

TIME CUT

Lou sits in silence

TIME CUT

Lou looks up at Margot

Offscreen she gives him a quizzical look which he responds
to
LOU (CONTD)
Just Do me a favour
115 INT MARGOTS BATHROOM 115

Margot takes a shower crying the water running down her
face A spurt of cold water hits her in the face She
squeals The shower curtain opens slowly Lou stands there
facing her glass of water in his hand She looks at him
looks at the glass Puts it together

MARGOT
You

LOU

MARGOT

She lets out an incredulous laugh Looks at him
questioningly

MARGOT
Theres no

LOU

for her whole life and itll make
her laugh It was kind of a long
term joke

Margot laughs And cries a bit Lou leaves the room
116 INT MARGOTS KITCHEN 116

LATER

(CONTTNURFD )

116

Margot sits at the kitchen table She watches Lou through the
glass outside smoking It is an exact replica of the scene
we saw earlier where she bobbed her head to the music except
the music is sadder and all domestic bliss is gone now He
doesnt look at her She watches him smoke He turns towards
the glass She can read his lips as he says

LOU
Go

Margot shakes her head vigourously Crying Lou nods
Suddenly full of resolve and strength But also with a
surprising gentleness he says

LOU (CONT’D)
Go on Go

Margot rises trembling from the table She walks slowly out
of the house past the family photos on the wall out the
door

EXT MARGOTS HOUSE 117

Margot walk speeds gradually up and she begins to run And
run And run The music gets louder and louder more frantic

EXT CITY STREETS 118

Margot runs down College St through Trinity Bellwoods Park
down to the lakeshore

EXT LAKESHORE 119

There is no one here Margot sits down Catches her breath
Stares at the horizon She hears a voice behind her

SETH
There you are

INT MARGOT AND SETHS LOFT 120

We hear the song Take This Waltz by Leonard Cohen over the
following

MONTAGE - In one long tracking shot we see Seth and Margot
making love over the course of a year together

Margot and Seth stand in the middle of a large unfurnished
space The walls are white it is untouched It is washed in
sunlight In a wide shot we slowly dolly in a circle around
them They begin to kiss to slowly undress each other we
wipe past a wall Another day

(CONTTNURFD )

120

As we see them again we see them making love on the floor
We continue our circle around the room Another day They lie
naked in each others arms staring at each other there are
now a few pieces of furniture in the room We wipe past the
wall again and when we find them again (another day) there
is another woman with them The three of them kiss and take
off each others clothes We wipe past the wall again

CUT TO
INT MARGOT AND SETHS LOFT 121

Another day Two feet pop up into frame They are each
grabbed by two male hands that begin massaging them We swing
up to the ceiling now to look down We see that Seth and
Margot are now having a threesome with another guy They both
stroke and kiss Margot and we continue our circle around
them Our view obscured once again by a wall We see them
again as we wipe past the wall Another day When we see them
this time they are alone again making love this time
without the same urgency The apartment is now fully
furnished We slowly circle them We wipe past the wall
again When we find them again they are sleeping Margot
with her head on Seths chest Another wall another day
another reveal Margot and Seth watch TV Margot snuggles
into him

MARGOT
(in baby voice)
I wuv you

Seth looks at her quizzically Smiles

MARGOT (CONTD)
(baby voice)
I said I wuv you

Seth brushes it off by leaning in for a grown up kiss
INT MARGOT AND SETHS LOFT 122

Seth brushes his teeth Margot comes into the bathroom sits
on the toilet and pees Seth begins flossing leaves the
room Margot watches him go

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET 123

Margot walks along the street with a grocery bag She stops
suddenly Aware of something She sniffs the air Something
familiar She smiles faintly Turns towards the direction it
is coming from She sees that she is outside a cookbook
store Inside the window there is a book launch with many
different chicken dishes being served to the guests

(CONTTNURFD )

123

She sees Lou in their midst Smiling talking to people She
watches him through the window and the throng of people
inside She waits there for a few moments wistful Then
decides to keep walking

EXT TORONTO ISLAND FERRY 124

Margot rides the ferry alone to the island She looks pensive
as she looks out at the water A man beside her notices her

MAN
What are you thinking about

Margot looks at him Smiles to herself

MARGOT
Nothing Really

He feels rebuffed and walks away Margot breathes deeply
INT SCRAMBLER 125
Margot is whipped around by herself in the darkness We hear
once again Video Killed The Radio Star She closes her
eyes sad
INT MARGOT AND SETHS LOFT 126
The place has now been lived in for some time Margot is
lying on the couch looking up at the skylight She is
chewing on a candy She takes the pink candy wrapper and
holds it up to the skylight Watches the light glow through
the wrapper Seth is painting

MARGOT

We havent been to the Cabot Trail
yet

Seth looks up Smiles

SETH
No we havent

A pause

MARGOT
Do you want me to organize it

SETH

(CONTTNURFD )

126

Margot lets out a barely perceptible sigh She gets up and
starts looking for flights on the computer

EXT CABOT TRAIL 127
We see the same image as we did in Margots dream The same
picture postcard image of the entrance to the Cabot Trail
Except this time Seth and Margot walk together down the path
They reach the edge of the cliff take in their surroundings
Then kiss

SETH
Im glad we didnt wait

Margot smiles There is a silence They arent sure what to
do next They look around a little longer Then head back
down the path

INT MARGOT AND SETHS LOFT 128
Margot lies on the couch staring at nothing Seth busies
himself getting ready to go to work He comes over and

kisses her lightly on the head

He strokes her head a bit paternally
MARGOT
No Just get me garlic I want

She keeps walking tears streaming down her face

INT MARGOT AND SETHS LOFT 130

Margot stirs muffin batter The kitchen is very similar in
design to the one in her house with Lou

Nouvelle Vagues Loungey version of This is Not A Love Song
plays on the stereo It’s sweltering hot She wipes sweat
from her forehead She pours the batter into a muffin tin
very carefully She puts the tin in the oven We realize
weve seen this scene before

Margot switches on the oven light She bends down to look at
the muffins rising The shadow of a man passes her He walks
to the window at the back of the kitchen and stands there As
before we see only his outline out of focus in the back of
the frame But this time we realize that the man is in fact
Seth Not Lou Margot sits down on the floor beside the oven
Leans her head and rests it on the oven door lit by the
warm glow of the light The muffins rise She watches them
the expression on her face a curious mixture of peace
yearning contentmentand longing In the background Seth
puts his hand on the window Shafts of light fall on the
floor

The End
