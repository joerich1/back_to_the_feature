Flash of inspiration Dredd excitedly signals Hershey

HERSHEY
Central This is Judge Hershey
I hereby file formal charges of
murder against Chief Justice Griffin
and Council Judge Rico And I order
you to give me the location of the
Janus Lab so that I may personally
make the arrest

CENTRAL
Certainly Judge Hershey However
as per Mega-City Code Section 84
Paragraph A I need authorization
from the Chief Justice to arrest
a Council Judge Similarly as
stated in Paragraph B same
Section I need authorization from
any Council Judges to arrest a Chief
Justice In this case that would
be Chief Judge Griffin and Council

Judge Rico
DREDD
(THROWN)
We need permission from them to
arrest them

Basically yes And without their

authorization you cannot file
charges and without charges I
cannot violate Security and tell
