The End

Screenplay (precisely as purchased by the producers
by Willard King Bradley

Inside Secrets of Photoplay Writing and Birth Control

Here are three paragraphs from screenwriter Willard King
Bradleys 1926 book Inside Secrets of Photoplay Writing
in which he discusses the inspiration for his 1920 script
Empty Arms (he notes that of all my pictures it is
probably the most successful both artistically and
commercially and claims it grossed over half a million
dollars)

‘I was seeking a theme for a photoplay of
large dimensions -- I had just received an
order from a producer to write such a
otoplay -- when an article favoring

irth control fell into my hands The
riter of it a woman was deadly opposed
child-bearing In her opinion (tho
she learned is one of those mysteries
ich defy solution since she professed

o be a spinster) motherhood was a

courge an insult a stone around the

eck of modern womanhood I didnt agree
ith her I saw in motherhood only that

ich was beautiful and God-like I ached
to write an answer to her nature-flaunting

Set pute yrdt se oU
g°

expos Then out of the air came the
question Why not write a photoplay
flaying the evils of birth control and
glorifying motherhood

A dozen plots presented themselves I
wrote a number of them then started all
over again My first effort sounded too
much like a sermon my second like a
physicians treatise I realized that
first of all the story must entertain
The photoplay fans pay their quarters to
be entertained not to be preached to So
I sugar-coated the pill by making the
propaganda subservient to the dramatic
action

After another effort I succeeded in
completing a single-track theme about a
woman a pampered daughter of the upper

ten

who through prejudice and fear

balks at maternity Then for dramatic
contrast I rewrote the story employing
another woman who welcomes motherhood
This done I decided to give the fans a
run for their money by injecting a
fight a head-on train wreck collision
and a fashionable party bearing the more
or less intriguing designation of Pagan
Revel

Later in the

book the author helpfully includes the first

page or so of his script The opening title reads

Our message is not for the mothers of the
world -- they have already done their
splendid share -- but for those married
women who through fear ignorance vanity
and prejudice wilfully violate His Supreme
Command

This is followed by a dissolve to a close-up of the Bible
over which is superimposed the Supreme Command Increase

- Multiply

and replenish the earth

The opening scene finds Diane the pampered daughter of a
copper magnate reading a novel called Sex and Society

As she thinks over what she has read
Diane bites her lip Rising she closes
her eyes Then as a sudden thought strikes

her

she raises her hand to her mouth with

a gesture betokening terror and exclaims

Spoken Title

I wont -- I wont marry Bruce
For some reason the author does not tell us more about the
fight the head-on train wreck collision or the Pagan
Revel Too bad -- that would have really given us a run
for our money

Mind you this is his most artistically successful picture
