Against a backdrop of towering Marina fortresses
a SORRY SCENE is taking place
BOLIVAR an ancient chicano in a beret is being evicted

by SHERIFFS DEPUTIES under the supervision of KID SAMEDI
the celebrity realtor KID SAMEDI is a pallid blond
five foot one clad ina white velour Jogging suit

BOLIVARs refrigerator lands in the alley with a crash

BOLIVAR
What are you throwing that
out for Its yours

SAMEDI
The hell with all that stuff
Kid Samedi‘s going solar

SAMEDI extracts a slim panatelia
Instantly several DEPUTIES drop BOLIVARs belongings

oe INEZ
Mariposa Pendejo

INEZ is nineteen years old and has green hair
A small crowd of watching locals applauds her boldness

SAMEDI

Watch that tongue chiquita
I hold indentured tenure on
the old mans latifundio

The crowd gasps INEZ snorts derision

A SHOT rings out and SAMEDIs panatella splits in two

DEPUTIES

ATOP THE REFRIGERATOR stands an unforeseen participant
His back against the sun a tall thick-set fellow in

a shabby trenchcoat and a shapeless hat wearing spectator

TRADE

Youre too late Samedi
I have here a writ of Caveat
Magnificat enjoining you to
nary evict the old dude Bolivar
Sibi Numaquanm

BOLIVAR and INEZ form a-little trinity with TRADE
BOLIVAR bites his thumb at SAMEDI INEZ flips him off

SAMEDI
That may be so Trade
But Itm the one that has the
uniforms and guns
(cracking the whip)
Back to work boys

TRADE takes a breath We hear his shirt rip

TRADE

If your muchachos touch another

can of menudo Samedi itll

Again-the COPS freeze in the act of junking BOLIVARs
belongings They cast sidelong glances at SAMEDI

SAMEDI
Ho you know whom youre threatening

Marina realtor

TRADE
(impassive)
Check out the menudo Samedi

and sure enough a foot from SAMEDIs alligator boots
lies an evicted cas¥of Perez Menudito Brand Hominy Tripes

Go for it boss
We re here to back you up

DEPUTY 2
You think hes serious
The guys blind

SAMEDI
Its a great feeling
Knowing you can do anything
you want

SAMEDI picks up the can and shies it at the old man
TRADE puts a bullet right between the “KIDs eyes

SAMEDI and the DEPUTIES are quite surprised
SAMEDI S-surprise is short-lived

DEPUTY 2
You got a license for that
piece Trade

TRADE
Sure

DEPUTY 1
Well i
Keep your nose clean that’s all

The DEPUTIES dump BOLIVARs stuff and shuffle off
-keeping a watchful eye on the BLIND PRIVATE EYE with
the unerring aim

BOLIVAR shakes TRADE by the hand INEZ eyes ara pools
of frozen liquid admiration The crowd applauds
A TY CREW appears and films the body

TRADE

their cars)
How about a ride

We couldnt have lost the EMU
contract at a better time
It made the national press in

But it did make us feel a little
tenuous Here was a band that
was world-famous but that nobody
had ever heard

PICADILLY CIRCUS DAWN
The familiar statue is sheathed in wooden planking

JOHNY steps out of the Tube He wears a brown
travelling-salesman suit and yellow string tie

Among the stalls displaying porn and regal souvenirs
the ARCHES have been plastered with posters which read -

LONDON FLOODING -
WILL YOU BE AFFECTED

JOHNY stumbles in the archway - bangs his nose against
a poster

ee RENEES VOICE
And out of this sense of tenuousness
came Johnys - ah - apocalyptic vision
I hate to use the words the papers
did but

Out past the postered arches red buses flash by brilliantly
and the city sounds rise in pitch and intensity

and in dreamlike slow motion
the Thames bursts its banks

Six siren bursts at 15-second intervals as the tidal

wave engulfs the City and carries off the Houses of Parliament

Windsor Palace the South Bank and the financial district

The buildings are not real
Instead intricate models fashioned out of matchsticks
cornflake packets soap boxes

Above the roar of water and the tumbling of walls -

RADIO VOICE
Bus underground and rail services
will be reduced about two hours
after the early warning and will
cease after the sirens sound

LONG SHOT OF THE DROWNED CIty

More fun than the electric chair
Burning babies boil the air

ADELE lies down beside him

ADELE

Youre the only one that really
believes in what were doing
Ringo Thats worth something

RINGO
Who gives a fuck

She starts to tease his matted hair back into spikes
He turns his back on her

Her hands trace the marks of fingernails down his back

ADELE
Theyre so full of shit it makes
Me sick After fucking CBEs

RINGO leaps up and slams into the bedside table -

AWOL 80 CLUB NYC NIGHT

A swollen mass of SERIOUS PUNKS waits on the debris floor
Shaven heads leather and fixed expressions of grim anticipation
The house lights are still up

PUNKS
BASTARDS BASTARDS BASTARDS
BASTARDS BASTARDS BASTARDS

WE SLIDE into the crowd - odd faces that we recognise -

RENEE with her familiar contingent of reporters - SLIM BURT
CHOOLIGAN and NIX competing for the nymphets -— ADELE perched
on the edge of the stage -

- and RIK TRADE the blind private eye

BASTARDS BASTARDS Do eee neers aT

TRADE canes his way into the auditorium accompanied by
SPAZ RAZER - whose newly-waxed cranium glisters like

a lightbulb SPAZ grabs TRADE by the gannex-enfolded
arm

SPAZ
Shes over there man
Sitting on the stage

TRADE
(grimly )
Point thine arrow straight and true

SPAZ angles TRADE in the right direction
Electricity begins to tingle in the air
The lights are going down

SPAZ

TRADE
What difference does that make

SPAZ
No - you dont understand -

But TRADE his goal almost attained isnt going to let
a little PUNK SOIREE stand in his way

The dance area erupts instantly into THREE CONCENTRIC
HUMAN CIRCLES - oS

THE OUTERMOST - the largest - consists of rock critics
sensation-seekers table-sitters and other pussies -

THE INTERMEDIARY is a tighter DMZ of parasites who come
to push the boys and feel the girls behinds
Occasionally one of these types is bollocked or dragged
into

THE INNER CIRCLE - where all is sliding swirling inter-
twining mania - a morass of crashing and colliding bodies
that makes perfect sense where you cant hear the music
any more and all that matters is to stay on your feet -

RIK TRADE is caught in the dead center of the inner

circle In his homburg hat and shades and dirty coat
he is the epitome of punk And hence the most attractive

target in the room

JOHNY sings through showers of spit
RINGO plays and doesn‘t move
The band is hot tonight

JOHNY -
Gimme gimme gimme ne

Gimme stuff I never seen

Gimme an insane machine

Makes me what I want to be
Junk that aint no good for me

frenzied mod - he-lays about him with his stick and cuts - 92 0 707

Almost within reach of ADELE TRADE collides with a

and nearly falls - belabours the PUNK with his stick -

JOHNY

The crowd is frantic ‘People jump on stage and RON - oe
enthusiastically throws them off The air is thick with
spit and beer

Several BOUNCERS propel TRADE empty-handed to the exit -
- and in the break between the songs ADELE and RINGO gob
spitballs at each other Theyre very much in love

RENEES VOICE
He isn’t going to change his mind

NIXS VOICE

IN THE HOTEL ROOM

ADELE works desperately to wake up RINGO
She draws the blade across his chest»
A slow beadwork of blood appears

ADELE

ADELE watches the blood spread Shes so fascinated
that she draws another line across his chest - forming
an X

She turns over goes to sleep

SPAZ and JOHNY tiptoe down a winding stone staircase
They carry several items of booty - tiaras a coronet
two oil paintings - theyre looking for the back door

SPAZ

RECORDING STUDIO INTERIOR DAY

Lots of potted palms Bored session men and engineers
on overtime SPAZ and RAS NORMO in the control room

The NARCOTICS SQUAD wanders through searching for illicit

substances The cops have red eyes and are uncoordinated

Snow on their boots
In the booth a black DETECTIVE chats to NORMO

DETECTIVE

SPAZ pushes the dgor into the studio and is almost
stifled by a wave of tropical heat

POLICEMEN poke around among the potted plants and palm
trees You cannot see the walls

SPAZ
Ringo

GUITAR NOTES guide’him through the jungle
A tape loop of crickets starts to play

And SPAZ encounters RINGO sitting -underneath a banyan
tree Nearby jacyzzi water bubbles softly

RINGO
How you doing Spaz

RINGO tunes his guitar Thinner than ever
Like a praying mantis sitting on a stick

SPAZ
Sounds good

RINGO
(concentrating)

SPAZ
Must be pretty near Ringo
Youve been tuning it all day

RINGO-grunts Tightens another string It breaks
A high electric disappearing scream

SPAZ

RINGO
It doesn’t matter

SPAZ shrugs and climbs into the jacuzzi

RINGO

See me and her

SPAZ

RINGO
The Kon-Tiki
Its a motel on La Bamba

SPAZ nods submerges

IN THE BOOTH

The phone rings NORMO gets it
Listens for a moment then throws the talkback switch -

SPAZ RAZOR brisks it through the ‘Lunchtime crowd

and carries an expensive mohair briefcase

He doesnt see the BEEFY HAND until it’s clenched around
his shoulder dragging him into the alley -

“IN THE ALLEY

SPAZ tries to throw the case away forgetting its
chained to his wrist

SUNSET STRIP AFTERNOON

An open top Eldorado slides into frame

JOHNY is in the front seat his bodyguard ROLF at the wheel

In the back sit SEVERAL RECORD MOGULS - screaming to de

let out ag ROLF takes a corner on two wheels

NIXS VOICE

I cant handle him at all

Hes

as obstinate as Ringo and

ten times as arrogant Its like

- he

doesnt value - my advice

The Eldorado swings onto the Freeway

NIXS VOICE
I hope to god Im wrong

INTERVIEWER
We all do sir

Traffic is inordinately heavy and the Eldorado slows

down to a crawl They pull alongside a Cadillac whose
occupants are weeping - a rust-encrusted Chevrolet creeps
past them blowing its horn - the MEXICANS inside the fur-
lined car are laughing passing round a joint

JOHNYS VOICE

We hit the Hollywood Freeway

after the first alarms

Hoping to make it up Mullholland

and hide out till the thing

blew over

Everyone else it turned out

had the same idea
The cars are almost at a standstill
The Eldorado is hemmed in by fat American station wagons -
clean panicked faces in windows bristling with guns

With a hollow earripping roar a fleet of motorcycles
fiashes between the lanes Narrow-eyed blacks on
Kawasaki 900s whipping towards the hills

A MUSHROOM CLOUD rises above the city

GAS STATION PHONE BOOTH DAY

ADELE feeds a dozen quarters into the machine
Taps her fingers on the glass waiting for her connection

“Smoke rises through the shifting spotlights
A cheap cassette recorder is on every table RENEEs

The lights dim and the tense crowd erystallizes
RINGOs band begins to play

RINGO strides on stage - an instant frenzy of unearned
adulation - he wears skintight leather pants and t-shirt
- no guitar he freezes like a startled insect inches
from the mike and starts to sing

The PA is apalling and we cant hear the words
This doesnt really matter since RINGO cant remember them

-- PUNK VOICE
It was - like fucking - —
INTENSE - you know - he was
THE OUTER LIMITS - words can’t

RINGOs band is competent professional practised
totally lacking in electricity

LEN stands on the pogo floor He isnt bopping
RON sits with RENEE He turns her tape recorder off

RENEE —

Hes warming up Ron

Maybe the late show -
RON

Yeah
RINGO missteps and falls heavily - hands grab him some
pulling him up some holding on - the BOUNCERS wrench
him loose and set him on his feet again - demented applause

He walks off stage The band maintains

BEHIND THE STACKS

RINGO consumes large quantities of energiser
The band plays on - is someone jeering -

INTERVIEWER
Funerals

HIGHGATE CEMETERY DUSK

A group of elite PUNKS and PRESSMEN fake a funeral scene
An actorish PRIEST intones above the grave

Its snowing
ae PRIEST 7

But see - amid the mimic rout

A crawling shape intrude

A blood-red thing - it writhes it writhes
The mimes become its food

LENs coffin is lowered with due severity into the grave
Through the thick glass window his waxen powdered face
is visible He plays dead right until the first earth
hits the pane - and then his eyes open and he starts to
scream in silence - banging on the glass -

Tne burial continues

JOHNY and RINGO look up simultaneously - by accident -
and catch each others eye - and JOHNY grins -

LENS LOFT EVENING

Black paint on almost all the windows
Through the gaps snow can be seen falling through amber
streetlight The walls are white with beams of golden
afternoon light painted on them

The only furniture is a drumkit a refrigerator and
several sacks of potatoes that serve as chairs

JOCHNY and RINGO sit on the potatoes drinking FOSTERS LAGER

JOHNY

BASTARDS in their dripping clothes

VERONICA

JOHNY walks across to the window and throws it open
Snow streams slowly in ‘RINGO plays with a guitar

JOHNY
The winter of 79

Powder three foot deep on the M-1
The trains dont run because the
rails have frozen The airports
closed down

(he smiles wolfishly)

Were losing our grip

RINGO watches JOHNY with tired familiar eyes
JOHNY finds the drumsticks and taps a random pattern
on the skins

SOHNY -
(singing)
Church police came round this morning
And the armys on our track
Took away my books and papers
Only just got out the back -
RINGO

JOHNY slowly closes -his mouth which has fallen open
JOHNY

I cant believe you said all that
Thanks Ringo - henceforth Ill be
a different man - especially when
the planets all line up

RINGO throws his beer over JOHNY - JOHNY jumps him and
they fight - not very hard since neither one is very
strong or into fighting -

LEN walks in Hes shivering and even wetter than they
are - covered with graveyard dirt and snow

LEN
Run us a bath you bastards

RINGO and JOHNY lay off wrestling to watch him
LEN deposits a muddy trail across the loft

Rand J
Good funeral Len

LEN
Thanks men

He enters the bathroom and encouters VERONICA
Shuts the door

RINGO looks at the guitar Theyve smashed it fighting
a JOHNY a
Too bad eh

RINGO
No

He gets up and walks out the door
JOHNY taps the drums with wire brushes

AND WITH A BOOTED CRASH RINGO BOUNCES BACK INTO THE ROOM —

RINGO
BQOQOOOOM °

This scares the pants cf JOHNY
RINGO exits laughing
IN THE STREET

RINGO lingers on the corner laughing still
His feet sink in the snow

-Across ‘the road stands ERNIE ROUNDS - draped in a oritish
legion flag bespecked-with jubilee regalia - He holds
a wilting cardboard sign which says

VOTE BOTTCHER FOR A WHITE TOMORROW

Two PARATROOPERS guard him They wear steel helmets
combat gear and agrry perspex riot shields

Nobody takes a blind bit of notice

RINGO walks away into the amber blizzard disappears
JOHNY watches from the attic window

JOHNYS VOICE
“Have a bunch of kids indeed
fF course he was on acid
yY never really knew him

SLOW FADE TO AMBER -

LENS VOICE
We went back to Norads one night

RENEES VOICE
Ringo was there He hung out
with a new crowd now Real charmers

CLUB NORAD NIGHT

RINGO enters flanked by several TOUGH PUNKS
They have bald heads severed ears eye patches -
fugitives from an Italian Western

The rest of the clientele are RADIANT CELEBRITIES
Young clean upwardly-mobile types in pre-torn t-shirts
plastic pants and trendy skinny ties

St - WHISPERED VOICES
“Thats Ringo - did you see the
sketch they did on Saturday Night
Live - I done it aaaaarrgghh”
ha ha ha - he looked taller

RINGO freezes opposite a YOUNG EXEC in a chic t-shirt
reading LET RINGO GO KILL ME INSTEAD

RINGO
Shall I

YOUNG EXEC
Its just a t-shirt

- RINGO nods sympathetically
He takes the EXEC’s glass and ‘smashes it in ‘his face

Instantly SIRENS SOUND

yiodel

RED SPOTLIGHTS center on RINGO as he ascends the stage
He scans the audience - theyre all there NIX RENEE
the BASTARDS the VIDEO DOCUMENTARIANS from Ethiopia

He plucks the mike from its stand
Pin-drop city

Smoke generators start up noisily
A BATHROOM SET descends from the flies
An UNSEEN BAND begins to crank

RINGO
(singing)
Some people are easily pleased
Im not I‘m a disease
When I get my gun man
(You bet I keep it loaded)

Some people gonna find themselves deceased

The REL SPOTLIGHTS circle over the uneasy crowd

RINGO
I used to have a couple friends
They stuck with me until the end
‘The end was last week
They left me a note

They said they found themselves another trend

Tell you a joke

Me uncle Bill went out last night
They brought him back in a bag

I thought about it - it’s all right
‘He was-a fuckin drag

The BAND is cooking now And RINGO is performing -
sliding like a cat across the tiled floor - the AUDIENCE
and spotlights reflected in the bathroom mirror at the
KON TIKI MOTEL

RINGO
Somewhere else is bound to be
a better bet than here
Next year is gonna be a better
wetter year
Im gonna get myself a better pad
fill it with better girls
Go to-night school twice a week
a and make peace with the world

ADEL is in tne bathroom now - in a Fiorelli nightie -
brushing ner teeth and removing Atroce Accessories

i12

and RINGO
The trouble is too much went down
too fast too far too slick
Too easy too convenient too obvious
too quick
I know how Mr Oswald felt and Mr Ruby
too
And all the animals that blinked
and got put in the zoo
4 wasnt me I wasn’t there
Im really not that thick
Cause when the dogs began to bark
Ringo was being sick
KON TIKI MOTEL EXTERIOR NIGHT
The motel still staads - unscarred by flames - a FLASHBACK
RINGO vomits in the road outside

INSIDE THE MOTEL

the door swings open and a WHITE CANE swishes its way
through the steam from the bathroom

ADELE
Ringo

No reply Suspicious she reaches for RINGOs straight-
edge shiv

° ADELE a
If youre here to rip us off
youre two months too late --

She steps into the bedroom -
and RIK TRADEs iron hand closes around her wrist
TRADE
Shows over little lady
You and I are going home
ADELE

FUCK YOU

She stabs him in the arm with RINGOs knife
TRADE recoils - astounded - and she sprints for the door

She wrestles with the chain - TRADEs coming after her
like Frankenstein - she darts towards the oathroom -
he tries to cut her off -

They fight like panthers in the bathroom - she claws
blood out of his cheeks - screaming -

- and TRADE wrangles the blade out of her hand and stabs
her White trenchcoat skin walls washed with red
blood - the rising steam turns pink -

ADELES VOICE
Before the gig we slept for
Beveral days We copped that
Brning - good stuff - Ringo always
claimed he never had dreams
I dont believe that Wed planned
to move out of there the next day
T was getting too heavy

TRADE finishes the jon of killing ADELE
Clutching his bleeaing wrist he hurries out -

- bumping into RINGO in the hall

TRADE
Scuse me

ADELES VOICE
There were seedy types at the
Kon Tiki see Junkies and thieves
Degenerates

RINGO discovers ADELEs body on the bathroom floor
Rips up the sheets and tears the doors off cupboards
Spills scotch and ether Sets the place on fire

TV SCREEN

ADELE in heaven interviewed by the VIDEO DOCUMENTARIANS
She wears a black bra and a pair of fluffy wings
Fondles a doped-out LAMB Pink candyfloss clouds
Attendant ANGELS yawn

ADELE
Its pretty neat up here
But I feel kind of LONELY
you know If Ringos listening
- I guess I shouldnt say it
should I

She shrugs and waves at camera CHANNEL CHANGE

IN THE BATHROOM Sgr

RINGO embraces ADELEs body on the floor

Her blood is all over him His knife glints at his
feet Flames eat up the STAGE
APPLAUSE
GIRLS VOICE -
think its Kool he killed her
