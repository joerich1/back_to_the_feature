(looks at Carrie)
I’m an enigma A man of mystery

KEVIN
A man with too much free time is
what you are kiddo

The ‘kiddo’ is a bit awkward Hangs there It’s an
uncomfortable moment Carrie wants out She claps her
hands together nervously

CARRIE
Okay well I’m heading up the
mast

Kevin grabs her arm

( )

KEVIN
I can’t let you climb up there

Carrie watches Dan climb the mast She tries to avert her
eyes but it’s no use He’s a hot guy climbing a mast

EXT DECK - SUNSET

Dan is at the grill making burgers He and Carrie are
hanging out talking They are both in t-shirts and
faded jeans

DAN
Where’d you learn to sail

CARRIE
A lake in Wisconsin My
grandparents had a camp My Grampa
would take me out on his sunfish
One day I just felt it I knew I
could do it alone So the next
morning I snuck out andhad
the best time of my life It was
scary but worth it

DAN
The best things usually are

They lock eyes The burgers are burning He flips them

( )

CARRIE
What about you

Dan stares at the grill as he answers

DAN

Right here on the Atlantic on
the roughest day of the summer

(he takes a beat)
My father thought I’d seen him do
it enough times so he sent me out
To The Vineyard By myself I was
ten

(trying to make

light)
Good times

Carrie’s jaw drops

CARRIE
I’m sorry Dan That must have
been tough
They share a silence
DAN

Have you read A Farewell To Arms

CARRIE
Not in a while

DAN
Well there’s this one part where
he wrote ‘The world breaks
everyone and afterward many are
strong at the broken places’

Carrie looks away Takes a minute

DAN
So you didn’t tell me --
What’s with you and my father

CARRIE
I don’t know yet

He likes this
DAN
Good Field’s wide open

Interesting Deserves a pickle

She laughs He hands her a pickle She bites in pickle
juice down her chin

( )

He wipes it off just as Kevin walks onto the deck --
checks out the situation Not thrilled with the sudden
intimacy between Carrie and his son

He claps his hands together -- loudly and startles them
both Kevin is wearing a sky blue silk shirt and tan
linen trousers

KEVIN
Great sunset

DAN
Great slacks

Kevin ignores him and heads to the bar cart keeping one
eye on Carrie and Dan Kevin’s drink-mixing gets a little
violent He pops in a lime turns to hand her a drink

KEVIN
(forcefully shoving
the drink into her
hand)
Mojito

Carrie takes it a little alarmed

CARRIE
Thanks

DAN
Can I have one

KEVIN
You don’t like rum

DAN

Kevin starts to make another drink motions for Carrie to
join him He leans in keeping one eye on his son who is
putting the burgers on a platter

KEVIN

No one says another word until --

DAN

EXT NANTUCKET ISLAND -- OVERVIEW

EXT NANTUCKET HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

The halls are deserted Classes are in session Kevin
walks limping but without his cane through the hallway
He looks around checks out the lockers smiles
intermittently and then heads for the trophy case

KEVIN’S POV
( )

The trophies pictures and plaques are displayed going
back decades His eyes fall on his picture his medal
his time He takes a long minute and stares at the
‘1975’

THE BELL RINGS and a moment later students pour out of
the classrooms Kevin stands among them taking it all in
before walking out into the present

KEVIN (0S)
Let me get to my notes Wayne

INT NANTUCKET HOUSE - DAY

Kevin is on the phone as he opens his computer and starts
to peruse and then a confused look comes over his face

KEVIN
This isn’t my computer

He sees and we see that it belongs to Dan Kevin looks
around sees Dan’s bags by the door His eyes go back to
the screen where Dan’s new company profile is up --

KEVIN
(distracted)
I’11 call you back

Kevin starts to look around the sight he’s beyond
impressed There’s a proud smile on his face when Dan
comes in the screen door in a wet suit

DAN
What are you doing up here

KEVIN
I needed to get away
(indicates the
computer )
This is fantastic
It’srevolutionary

Dan doesn’t say anything
KEVIN
Why didn’t you tell me about it
Why didn’t you come to me

Dan’s eyes open wide

DAN
Really Why didn’t I come to you

( )

Kevin is quiet

DAN
Nothing I have ever done is good
enough for you You’re never
proud it’s never enough it’s
never right You have a big
shadow Dad and shoes impossible
to fill Do you have any idea how
hard it is to be your son

Kevin looks as if he might die from sorrow

KEVIN

(finding it hard to

get the words out)
I am always proud of you I have
always been proud of you You are
the light of my entire life

(beat)
You are the reasonfor
everything Daniel For everything
I’ve ever done from the moment I
saw your face

The two men stare at one another Kevin composes himself

KEVIN
We had very different paths

DAN
And you never let me forget that

KEVIN
I didn’t want you to take it --
any of it -- for granted

DAN

It’s not my fault It’s not my
fault that I didn’t have to work
on the docks since I was twelve
didn’t have to put myself through
school and be a single parent
it’s not my fault that it was
handed to me I have worked so
hard to please you -- since that
seventh grade science test when
you said I could do better than a
‘B’

KEVIN
I just meant

( )

DAN
No Let me finish So I pushed
and pushed and got into those
great schools and made those great
grades but still it was handed
to me I didn’t struggle enough I
didn’t struggle like you did

KEVIN
You had your own struggles You
didn’t have a mother

This silences them both After so many years she’s st
in the room Kevin moves around a sofa and sits down
remains standing arms folded

KEVIN
You can do anything you put your
mind to Dan You can have anything
you want in life

DAN
Except Carrie I loved her and I
gave her up for you Would you
have ever done that for me

Dan gives him a challenging look and walks out slammi

DAN
I don’t get it
KEVIN
(playful)
That’s because you’re ten years
old
KEVIN

Carrie is a woman and like any
woman she wants a real man

(off Dan’s look)
A woman like Carrie no matter how
independent she is wants a man
with bigger balls than she has so

to speak
(off Dan’s look)
She’s what -- thirty She’s been

on her own in this town for
twelve years She’s probably set
the bar a few times and the guys
she’s set it for well they can’t
reach When she met me she was
ready and by the nature of who I
am I was already there

(beat)
You can’t set a bar high enough
for me Cause I’m going to clear

trying to become the man he will
beand he will be a great man I
know this And I know that he
loves you and that he said what he
did to protect me

CARRIE
But he lied to me -- and
humiliated me and let me think
that he didn’t care
