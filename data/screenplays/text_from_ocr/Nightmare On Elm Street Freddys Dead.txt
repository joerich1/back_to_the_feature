CLOSE ON an eighteen year-old kid named JOHN He sits

balled up in a tight window seat in economy class His face

middle-aged neurotic He seems uncomfortable and nervous We

hundred and fifty pound WOMAN in a polyester pant-suit

walks by and John flags her down

stewardess attends to him

starts to vibrate It RUMBLES The NOISE gets LOUDER John
looks around trying to call the stewardess He hits his call

street sign They walk down the wasted avenue passing burned out
houses with crooked “FOR SALE” signs planted on their rotted
lawns

Tracy stops them in front of one particular house
