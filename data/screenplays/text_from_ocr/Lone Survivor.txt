Through massive sun flare a BLACKHAWK Chopper coming in

LUTTRELL
(vo)
It’s something most of us have
known all of our lives What we all
wanted It’s in our blood

A team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the
chopper An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and
COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper Tight shots
A bloody hand dangles A tear filled eyeball sliced feet

LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
(vo)
There’s a storm inside of us I’ve
heard many team guys speak of this
A burning A river A drive

INT OPERATING ROOM 2

Clothes cut Blood soaked Dog Tags cut “Luttrell” in UA
boxer shorts IVs and fresh blood bags Multiple Gunshots
Chunk of an ear missing Heartbeat monitor Weak pulse

LUTTRELL
(vo)
An unrelenting desire to push
yourself harder and further than
anyone could think possible

Chunks of bullet and shrapnel filling metal bowl Tears
streaming down cheeks a hand scrawled map on a left thigh
focused eyes of surgeons Admirals’ pace in the hallway

LUTTRELL (CONTD)
(vo)
Pushing ourselves into those dark
cold corners where the bad things
live Where the bad things fight

Heart monitor weak Getting weaker Compound fracture left
shin Bloody feet rinsed clean Water flushing out bullet
holes Loose cracked tooth pulled out Heart monitor getting
weaker

Surgical pack working franticly to save Luttrell

EXT AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY
INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE Intro Afghan warlord AHMAD SHAH
35 years old Tall strong Fierce He moves through an

Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban
warriors
LOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact This Shah and crew feels
like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town

NOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD These are real
warriors Strong-jawed Thin but ripped muscles Worn rich
soulful faces vivid eyes color reds and blues Strong
boots Military vests Good radio equipment Well-maintained
weapons

Shah’s number two is TARAQ Late twenties Shah is vicious
TARAQ is more vicious Strong and very very violent

A very worthy opponent

RIGHT now they are clearly pissed Shah leads the way walks
with purpose

They are looking for a man Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW
accused of aiding the Americans

Shah moves into a house Women and children terrified
Trembling Women pleading

SHAH SHAH
Where is he Hagha Cherta Dey

The women scream As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around
the room Slamming them viciously into walls

A 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah A YOUNG
BOY watches

GULAB GULAB
Please we want no trouble Mehrabanilutfan monga hes
mushkil no ghowaro

Taraq throws Gulab down hard Turns locks eyes with an older
Afghan man(30s) Taraq moves quickly at him kicking him in
the face his foot down hard on his throat

SHAH SHAH
Have you spoken with the Aya taso Americayano sara
Americans khaberi keri dey
AFGHAN MAN AFGHAN MAN
Please No Mehrabanilutfan Na

Gulab watches Frustrated Furious

TARAQ TARAQ
You lie Ta Dorogh wayee
AFGHAN MAN AFGHAN MAN

Please Mehrabanilutfan
8A

He’s pressing down hard Choking the man The man’s family
begs and screams Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes
Decides he’s lyingShah nods to Taraq

Taraq yanks the Afghan to his feet As his children watch
Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside Into the woods

Taraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log
Face up

Two of Taraq’s men hold him by the beard as Taragq stands over
him Razor sharp machete up

Shah backlit Ignoring the man’s pleadingas Taraq hacks
down with brutal fury

Tight on Shah tight on Taraq blood dripping from his hand

Hell yea I say shave him and he

back Shave the boy

MURPHY
Shane

SHANE PATTON
Well I could go both ways on this
He did lose but he was close and
youre Mike Murphy and I would have
expected a much bigger separation
Plus we’re at war and there’s the
whole Samson thing so I’m not
sure I’1l plead the fifth on this
one

Murphy looks stares at Shane

SHANE PATTON (CONTD)
But you’re the boss boss So I’m

Seems to do most of the chief shit

This is the best picture we have of
him It’s current

KRISTENSEN (CONTD)
We know Shah killed fourteen
Marines last Tuesday in Kandahar
We just pulled this video off three
different Tali web sights It will
in fact be a glorious day when
Ahmad Shah and his good friend
Taraq are no longer members of our
human community

Clear video of Shah executing a Taliban woman Two men hold
her down Shah fires an AK-47 The bullet kicking up dust as
it blasts through her skull into the dirt

The SEALs study this footage Dead serious

AXE
Go backfreeze

Axe studies an image of Shah

AXE (CONT’D)
No earlobes

MURPHY
What’s that

AXE
The guys got no earlobes

Silence as the team studies the image

SHANE
What are earlobes for anyway
DIETZ
Piercing and balance
SHANE
Balance
DIETZ

I heard earlobes are key for head
balance - equilibrium Cut a guys
ear off he’s gonna suck on a drunk
test balance beam tight rope

LUTTRELL
False Earlobes have no biological
functions for humans Fish can use
earlobes like a valve to open or
close the ear canal
14a

SHANE
Why would a fish want to let water
into his ear canal

Luttrell shoots him a look - “shut the fuck up”
Murphy keeps things moving

MURPHY
Bad guy Senior Taliban commander
responsible for killing Marines in
Eastern Afghanistan and sport
killing civilians in the Hindu-
Kush Considered Tier One target
rumored to be close to Bin Laden
Axe is going to go over our route
in

AXE
The helo pilots are going to do two
false inserts Then drop us off at
our primary insert located here
Secondary insert located here
From our primary insert our
bearing will be zero three zero
patrolling 15 kilometers to our
designated lay up point We will
be moving up the backside of this
mountain which will offer us good
concealment from the target but the
terrain is gonna be rocky so watch
your footing I’m estimating it’s
gonna take us about two hours to
complete

Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake
and contrary to popular belief
there is poison oak so watch the
cock and balls cause that will
suck Drink lots of water wear
sunscreen and Dietz bring your own
chapstick

somebody up Other than that don’t
sweat it

Murphy picks up a plastic AC-130 and holds it over the map

MURPHY
AC-130 is with us

Dietz takes the plane from Murphy Moves it over the map

DIETZ
Correct Just for the infil All
comms will be relayed through the
AC-130 call sign Apollo Suns up
she’s out Some of the key pro-
words - when we have a successful
insert Budweiser When we’re
halfway through infil it’1l be
Corona At our observation point
Schlitz Malt Liquor And if we
positively identify Shah
touchdown

Danny chucks the toy plane

MURPHY
Reaction Force is the following
The 47s will relocate to J-Bad
overnight

Murphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and
location of the QRF

KRISTENSEN
That’s correct You’ll have fifteen
team guys and about a dozen
Marines standing by all night When
we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor were
heading back to Bagram for phase 2
QRF will stay here - we’re leaving
you with 4 team guys 20 marines 2
Blackhawks and 2 Apaches The
Apaches stay with the Blackhawks

The toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear
understanding of the playing field

KRISTENSEN (CONTD)
The movement is so we can get the
47s back here and be ready to
bring it for phase two once you get
eyes on Shah Remember - comms will
most likely be intermittent and
there are reports that non-
combatants are being used as recon
elements for the enemy

What we have to do That’s it

will be done

Luttrell seems to get that with Danny out Murphy’s for

The rope Worst comms that I’ve

the right to do that to us

LUTTRELL
I don’t see it that way

MURPHY
So what is your fucking call bro

LUTTRELL
Let them go Shut it down

Silence

So if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it’s one vote
for killing them one vote for letting them go Danny is
neutral

This is all on MURPHY

Murphy turns away from them looking down the steep pitched
mountain The village far below

Murphy thinks Looks at the young kids The old man

Axe rolls his ankle hard Slips falls hard sliding fast
tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump

Sprained right ankle and bruised left ribs
Murphy stops looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe
Axe struggling back on his feet

LUTTRELL
You ok

AXE
Fucking Afghanistan

LUTTRELL
Yea I’m the one who’s supposed to
be falling

AXE
I’m fine

He takes a step White flash of burst pain tears through him
He buckles Clearly not alright

THE GOAT KID 43C
Running hard approaching the village

UP TOP 43D
Luttrell reaches for him Axe pulls away

AXE (CONTD)
I’m good Let’s go

Axe digs his foot in Grinds through the pain and starts back
up the hill

AXE (CONTD)
Maybe we should just hike down to
the village ask to borrow a phone
Tight on Murphy’s small smile as he digs it up the hill

The group now moving even slower cause of Axe’s ankle

EXT THE VILLAGE 44
Quiet A couple of small fires Some cooking A group of
young boys playing with sticks Women cooking as - The young
GOAT BOY comes tearing full sprint into the village

TIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY Eyes wide

Screaming for Shah

Villagers start to gather Shah approaches the boys
Breathing hard they point up the mountain

A couple of Taliban hear this Take off into the woods
TRACKING with the two Taliban
As they sprint deeper into the woods Into the Taliban camp

Taliban soldiers sleeping The two find Shah and Taraq Tell
them about the Americans

Shah quickly on his walkie talkie old school but deathly
effective Rounding up his fighters

Quick shots of the Taliban army Feels like 150 men Arming
themselves AK’s RPG’s grenades a lot of ammo Radio gear

Quiet cool professional These Afghan soldiers are loading
up big time

EXT UP MOUNTAIN 45
The SEALs cresting the hill

MURPHY

Comms still clearly dead Murphy weighing his options They
are high above the village Murphy pulls out binoculars
Scanning the village and mountain

All three SEALs on glass SCANNING

SEALS POV

Nothing moving From their vantage the town seems quiet
Business as usual

They cannot see the Taliban off in the woods They are
OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat

CUT TO

TWENTY MINUTES LATER 46

Danny still working the radio Axe has tightened his boot
Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill Staring down
at the village

Murphy’s got his SAT phone out Trying to get a signal

that it’s blocking his signal

Gently scanning the area of movement

Stops whistling
AXES POV
No movement

Axe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill Suddenly A FLASH OF
SOMETHING HUMAN

A HUMAN He pans a bit more to the right Then two more

AXE pans way to the right Almost as high as the SEALs are
and he see’s more movement

They are almost surrounded

TIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed

Danny desperate to get the radio to work

Luttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through
scope down hill

Lined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed
Taliban warriors each one of them with an AK pointing
downward Some carrying rocket propelled grenades

LUTTRELL looks left

More Taliban coming down hill to flank them

Luttrell looks right

fixing to get into a pretty good
gunfight

Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them

DANNY

AXE
Dunno

BACK TO MARCUS

His back pressed up against a tree inventorying his ammo
Grenades Knife

Danny Axe Murphy all doing the same Readying for war

Axe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their
wives taped inside their helmets

The trap tightening around all of them All four focused up
hill

A TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS

A flash of a turban Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his
general direction

Luttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts
pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree

Luttrell eyes on glass still as marble Aimed at the tree

Marcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also
trained on the tree

Marcus eyes back on the scope

SCOPE POV

A fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the
scope Black eyes and thick black beard The barrel of his AK
pointed dead on Luttrell

Hold

THEN

Luttrell fires once Blowing the man’s head off

An odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan
stumbles still standing still clutching his AK-47 He takes
three more steps towards Luttrell

Stops

Luttrell shoots again removes what’s left of the fighter’s
head

The Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground all HELL
BREAKS LOOSE

From above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open
fire

Screaming at each other communicating through violent loud
bursts of Pashto the Taliban moving fast down the hill
Agile and fearless not weighted down with US-style gear
they are able to leap boulders fallen trees

Tarag in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs UP
TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms

ON MURPHY

Taliban moving down the hill on both sides Shooting as they
move

A solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on
top of the hill above them

The SEALS are close to being surrounded
MURPHY checks his rear

First one is at least 300 feet

Murphy calls it

MURPHY
Push right flank

Axe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO
the wall of the Taliban flanking his right

Marcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right
Taliban flank

Charging the Ambush

MURPHY
Keep pushing right Kill ‘em all

The four SEALS fighting well as a team Crawling shooting
and covering as they start making progress killing their way
into the right side of the Taliban ambush

The Taliban close enough to see clearly

Axe shot through the left shoulder Ignoring it he keeps
firing His long scope making him very accurate As he shoots
deep into the left flank

TALIBAN POV

From behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into
the right side

Two more Taliban hit The remaining start taking solid
covering positions firing down at the four SEALs

Axe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower

Decent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked
to pieces by the incoming AK fire

Razor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe’s face and
neck Blood runs down his face drips off his chin

Luttrell getting equally shot up Returning fire His cover
rock getting shot up bad Chunks of granite tearing into his
face and neck

FURTHER to the left Danny and Murphy shooting trying to get
closer to Luttrell and Axe

Axe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet
tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his
chest

Axe keeps firing hitting a Taliban in the knee The Taliban
fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips
shearing up off the granite into Axe’s face Shredding his
right ear cutting into his eyeballs

Half blind Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with
blood Axe struggles to see When his vision clears up enough
to focus

AXE POV

Two Tali fighters Moving fast out of cover right at AXE
Directly at the Americans SEAL style Attacking the counter
attack

The Taliban are close to the half blind Axe Axe fires blind
Misses The Taliban almost on him Then

One of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell killed The
other wounded falls on Axe Vicious hand-to-hand fight

Luttrell runs up to help Axe Takes the remaining Taliban
soldier out with a point-blank headshot
