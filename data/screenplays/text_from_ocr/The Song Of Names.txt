FADE IN

EXT A CONCERT HALL LONDON 725 PM (NOVEMBER 3 1951) 1

As we look down a gentle rain is falling steadily on a
carapace of umbrellas moving like the scales of some

gigantic mythical reptile The reptile turns out to be a well-
dressed crowd swirling around the entrance to the hall and
funnelling slowly into it the same rain rolling down posters
advertising the event they’ve all come to see the debut
concert of David Eli Rapoport 21 year-old virtuoso

violinist

BBC RADIO PRESENTER (VO)
It is sometimes said that both the
shortest and the longest distance
in art is that between the very
good and the truly great It may
well be that tonight David Eli
Rapoport will cross that divide
Those of us who have been
privileged to hear his promotional
recording are unanimous in
declaring the extraordinary playing
of this 21-year-old Polish
immigrant music from the gods the
voice of possibly the most
naturally gifted violinist of his
generation

Cars are passing Festival of Britain flags flying from the
building Pasted across its facade are monochrome publicity
blow-ups of the lean and Byronic Rapoport and plastered
diagonally across the posters strip banners reading
“INTERNATIONAL DEBUT PERFORMANCE 730 PM NOVEMBER 3RD
1951 with another smaller strip overplastered “SOLD OUT -
RETURNS ONLY”

Touts are busy in the crowd selling outrageously priced
tickets to those who have come without one there’s a police
presence for crowd control - bobbies in glistening rain capes
- a phalanx of damp press photographers a St John’s
ambulance crew on stand-by

Limousines are delivering DIGNITARIES to the front steps
chauffeurs and assistants shepherding them inside under
umbrellas

CAMERA FINDS 21 YEAR-OLD MARTIN SIMMONDS

INT LONDON CONCERT HALL NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) (A’51) 2

Here there’s every shade of anxiety The capacity audience is
buzzing with restlessness the orchestra waits in silence
having long ago finished tuning up

The BBC RADIO PRESENTER whose voice we’ve been hearing can be
seen in the recording booth holding on to his audience
during the delay in the relaxed filibuster style we associate
with Richard Dimbleby at the Coronation still two years in
the future

BBC RADIO PRESENTER
So great has been the impact of
Rapoport’s recording on the world
of classical music that one tends
to forget how little known his name
still is and that tonight’s
concert will be his first on an
international stage

BACKSTAGE there’s a frenzy of activity and a sliding scale of
panic from the irritation of those mildly inconvenienced by
the soloist’s lateness to the near hysteria of those most
affected chief among them

GILBERT SIMMONDS

Gilbert the concert’s promoter is a 56 year-old English
gentleman-impresario He’s standing with his wife ENID and Martin’s fiancée 21 year-old HELEN Their son Martin
rejoins them as we watch shaking his head All are wearing
evening dress and all are agitated though none as much as
Gilbert

GILBERT
He’s had an accident There’s no
other explanation-

ENID
We don’t know that

GILBERT
Martin I’d like you to phone the
hospitals

MARTIN
I already did Father Mr
Sandersons doing it again now

ANGLE ON SANDERSON the theatre manager talking urgently on
the backstage phone

GILBERT
Has anyone informed the police

MARTIN
Too soon for that
Blue - SON D91 p3
GILBERT

How was he this afternoon Was he

all right at rehearsal

MARTIN
He was fine

GILBERT
Did he take his violin with him

MARTIN

He takes it everywhere He takes it
to the loo

Gilbert shoots his son a disapproving look Offended by the
indelicacy of the comment or by Martin’s attitude
ENID

Gilbert stop working yourself up
into a froth Perhaps his watch
stopped

GILBERT
A self-winding wristwatch does not
stop

ENID
It does if you drop it

HELEN
He might’ve got stuck in traffic

GILBERT
(to Martin)
Where did he

say was he going after
the rehearsal

MARTIN
He didn’t

HELEN
Dovidl does things his own way Mr

Simmonds He’s probably walking He
likes walking in the rain

GILBERT

With a Gagliano under his arm

(crossing to stage
entrance)

Have you seen who’s out there
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE

Several distinguished-looking men and women waiting
Blue - SoN D91 p4

GILBERT
Peers of the realm members of
Parliament The Times music critic
Such people are not kept waiting-

MARTIN
He’1ll be here This means as much
to him as it does to you

GILBERT
Does it really

MARTIN
I know-

GILBERT
You don’t know I’m not talking
about money

MARTIN
I know what you’re talking about

GILBERT
He could be lying in a gutter
somewhere - hurt dead

ANGE ON AUDITORIUM CLOCK showing 750
BACK TO GILBERT- by now on the edge of tears

The orchestra conductor is looking his way tapping his
watch tilting his head enquiringly Time to cancel

GILBERT
Theyll have to be told

MARTIN
Want me to do it

Gilbert shakes his head Steps through on to the stage

GILBERT

My Lords ladies and gentlemen

(voice quivering)
It is with great regret that I have
to tell you the performer you
have come to see is unable to be
here this evening

(gestures helplessly)
Refunds may be claimed at the box
office

He hurries offstage holding back his tears

EXT SIMMONDS HOUSE HAMPSTEAD LONDON DAY (SUMMER 1986)

TITLE “35 YEARS LATER”
Blue - SoN D91 p-5

A black cab pulls up outside the house and sounds its horn

Imposing and costly when it was built in the 1920’s and owned
by the Simmonds family ever since the house is now run down
and in need of repair and repainting In the double drive
sits a single ten-year-old car an anomaly in this affluent
two-car neighbourhood

INT SIMMONDS HOUSE DAY (S’86) 4

The style inside the house is cultured if a little shabby
floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in the drawing room full of
mostly hardback volumes a baby grand loaded with classical
sheet music somewhat old-fashioned furniture soft
furnishings in muted colours

A suitcase stands in the hall an overcoat and umbrella
draped across it a briefcase leaning against it

ANGLE ON KITCHEN

MARTIN SIMMONDS is now in his mid-fifties his body slim and
well kept HELEN whose cheek he is kissing in valediction
is still at the same age handsome

HELEN
(a ritual this)
Take your pills don’t wear the
same shirt twice sell music

MARTIN
Kiss Emily for me The minute the
baby’s born stick it in front of
the piano You can’t start too
soon

HELEN
‘It’ is a girl Martin The scan’s
showing a girl Granddaughter not
grand piano Ill call you if I’m
not asleep

MARTIN
And if the estimate for the roof
comes let me know straight away

HELEN
Why

MARTIN
I might have to walk home Save the
train fare

The taxi’s horn sounds again
Blue - SoN D91 p-6

EXT SIMMONDS HOUSE DAY (S’86) 5

Martin emerges coated carrying suitcase and briefcase
umbrella hooked over his arm He climbs into the waiting
taxi

EXT GATESHEAD RAILWAY STATION - PLATFORM DAY (S’86) 6

Exiting the station Martin is taken aback to find at the
barrier the city’s Lord Mayor CHARLIE FROGGATT in
full regalia and his driver

MARTIN
Charlie Froggatt look at you in
your gold chain Didn’t know this
was a civic reception Id have
worn my ermine underwear

The driver takes Martin’s suitcase As they walk towards the
station exit

FROGGATT
(Tyneside accent)
Just come from opening a DIY
superstore You’d think they’d do
it themselves wouldn’t you

INT DAIMLER (TRAVELLING) DAY (S’86) 7

FROGGATT
So you’re still peddling sheet
music I see

MARTIN
It’s a living Libraries and
schools buy it

FROGGATT
How long you staying

MARTIN
Just ‘til Friday

FROGGATT
What are you doing tonight

MARTIN
Hanging myself I expect

FROGGATT
How about doing an old friend a
favour first
Blue - SON D91 MARTIN
This old friend got any pull with
the Libraries Committee

FROGGATT
You do one for me I’1l do one for
you

MARTIN
That’s how the Great War started
(a beat)
What’s the favour

FROGGATT
Jury service

(off Martin’s reaction)
Competition jury Tyneside Young
Musician of the Year It’s world
famous

MARTIN
Not the world I live in

FROGGATT
Under-18’s who’ve slipped through
the music education net - they
actually play an instrument You’d
be non-playing Chairman

MARTIN
You’ve got to be joking

FROGGATT
I never joke about Tyneside You’d
just be a figurehead Like me
You’re still a name in the music
world man Your dad knew
Paderewski for Chrissake

MARTIN
I’m not my father Charlie And he
didn’t judge Paderewski’s
musicianship

FROGGATT
We’ve got a couple of long-hairs in
for that - Tom Noble and Jenny
Burrows you know Jenny You get
the casting vote if they hang

A packed hall an old Steinway grand onstage Below the
stage seated at a trestle table the panel of five
COMPETITION JUDGES Martin at their centre JENNY BURROWS on his left TOM NOBLE on his right CHARLIE
FROGGATT onstage in his mayoral regalia

FROGGATT
-and I have every confidence this
year’s finalists will maintain the
high musical standard for which
Tyneside is justly famous

Shouts of approval from the audience

TOM
(to Martin)
Vienna of the north-east

FROGGATT
So without further ado let
competition commence and may music
speak louder than words

He sits down to modest applause

A MONTAGE FOLLOWS WITH CUTS BETWEEN THE PERFORMERS AND THE
JUDGES COMPLETING THEIR MARK SHEETS

The first finalist is a 10 YEAR-OLD GIRL playing the Bach
Chaconne for clarinet

PANNING THE FIVE MARK SHEETS

Home-made on council-headed notepaper the mark sheets are
divided into three hand-drawn columns headed “TECHNIQUE”
“INTERPRETATION” and “MUSICALITY” with a fourth column for
totals The girl’s scores out of ten are uniformly in the
four-five range She scores lowest on interpretation
Blue - SoN D91 p9

- AN 11 YEAR-OLD BOY CELLIST playing Kreisler’s Liebesleid
with piano accompaniment He’s good for his age but in no way
outstanding Fives and the odd six

- THE ADJUDICATORS starting to look glazed Jenny glancing
at her watch

- 16 year-old MARIA KORVINSKY rippling off Beethovens
Bagatelle in G Minor as though warming up

The audience applause is appropriately mighty

The judges are smiling now lavishing nines and tens Gold
found in a midden Barring a further miracle they’ve got
their winner

JENNY
(through applause)
Can we go home now

MARTIN
One genius Jenny Might be two

JENNY
Aye well it is Gateshead

FROGGATT has come back onstage

FROGGATT
Our final Young Musician hails from
South Shields He’s 14 years old
and has already toured
internationally with the Tyneside
Youth Orchestra

TOM
(aside)
Wales and the Isle of Man

FROGGATT
--SO please put your hands
together for Peter Stemp

PETER STEMP a bad acne case steps onstage and readies
himself to play his three-year-old Japanese fiddle

ANGLE ON ELLEN STEMP his proud mother in the front row
of the audience

Then Peter does something very odd Prior to playing his
competition piece the boy reaches into his pocket pulls out
a block of rosin and ritualistically swipes his bow strings
with it - first a broad upward sweep then a matching
downward sweep Finally before putting the rosin away and
tucking the violin back under his chin-

HE TOUCHES THE ROSIN TO HIS LIPS

Blue - SoN D91 p10

There are some titters from the audience at the gesture
CLOSE ON MARTIN

He isn’t tittering His reaction is out of all keeping with
what has occurred It’s a reaction of such shock and emotion
so sudden and overwhelming that it has drained the colour
from his face

TOM
(to Martin)
You all right man

Martin doesn’t answer Too stunned to speak

Peter begins to play the second movement of Tartini’s
“Devil’s Trill” Sonata for solo violin - a difficult piece
beyond his skill level and it shows But though his
musicianship is far from exceptional it’s clear that someone
at some time has taught him some old-fashioned Kreislerian
slides and a particular treatment of the rosin that very few
teachers would countenance and no violinist in the history of
solo performance would ever exhibit in public save only
one

ANGLE ON PETER STEMP as he plays sliding inexpertly

ANGLE ON MARTIN as he listens

INT SIMMONDS HOUSE DAY (A’39) 10

--and the playing changes as the Tartini fades and we hear
an exuberant Wieniawski violin piece played by an
immeasurably superior violinist

ANGLE ON DAVID ELI RAPOPORT (DOVIDL) aged 9 as he plays
sliding with arrogant Kreislerian exuberance

ANGLE ON THE OPEN DOORWAY

where 9 YEAR-OLD MARTIN is watching and listening from the
hallway The emotions on his young face jealousy and
resentment

The small drawing room audience is composed of GILBERT(44
here) ENID PROFESSOR CARL FLESCH - Hungarian-born
soloist and London’s most celebrated pre-war violin teacher
and ZYGMUNT RAPOPORT Dovidl’s prematurely balding
Polish-Jewish father a Warsaw costume jeweller not a
refugee but with the abandoned worn-down look of one

Dovidl - black hair shiny as jet legs stick-thin in calf-
length shorts - is playing with the flashy show-off style of
a child genius who knows that only time and practice stand
between him and his birthright world-renown as a virtuoso
Flesch and Gilbert are listening pleasurably nodding
knowing it too

Blue - SoN D91 pl1l

Martin is two months older than Dovidl His grey flannel
shorts are the right length for London juvenile fashion of
the day - the only edge it seems he has on this exotic
interloper

Dovidl finishes the piece He looks up awaiting requests for
an encore spots Martin in the doorway meets his eye
briefly looks away

GILBERT
Professor Flesch What do you
think

FLESCH
Too many flourishes
(to Dovidl)
You are not Kreisler young man

DOVIDL
Kreisler is not Rapoport

A statement of calculated precocity It brings chuckles

ZYGMUNT
(to Flesch)
You will teach him He is genius

FLESCH
I am sent ten geniuses a month Pan
Rapoport If your son accepts that
he has still something to learn
perhaps I can teach him something
You are staying in London

ZYGMUNT
No I go back to Warsaw to my wife
and daughters If I can find
somebody to take David I leave
him here

FLESCH
Safer Given the situation in
Poland

GILBERT
(thoughtful )
Very much so

ZYGMUNT
Do you know of Jewish family Mr
Simmonds I can pay a little

GILBERT
As it happens I do have a family in
mind Mr Rapoport It isn’t Jewish
but it is musical and will cost
you nothing

(MORE)
Blue - SoN D91 p12

GILBERT (contd)
I can promise you the tenets of
your religion would be fully
respected its requirements met in
every regard

Gilbert looks across at his wife He almost certainly hasn’t
consulted her about this considerable commitment an
autocratic decision typical of the man ENID gives nothing
back - neither consent nor refusal approval nor disapproval

Zygmunt is aware how great a commitment this is It entails
among other things kosher food Hebrew lessons Sabbath
observance If he appears to hesitate consider where he has
come from Zygmunt cannot conceive of a Gentile Polish
paterfamilias making such an offer

ZYGMUNT
This is English family
GILBERT
It is
(a beat)

My own son is David’s age They
would share a bedroom

ANGLE ON MARTIN

Outrage on his face The brilliant interloper is to be
admitted to residence it seems without any family
consultation at all

Zygmunt’s eyes are sparkling with tears He embraces Gilbert
who stands stiffly to receive the embrace embarrassed by
this un-English gesture not knowing where to put his hands

Stepping back Zygmunt reaches into his pocket and pulls from
it a velvet-covered ring box Ceremoniously he presents it to
his son the tears overflowing now The boy opens the box

CLOSE ON RING BOX

The inside lid is stamped in gold leaf lettering “RAPOPORT
WARSZAWA” But there is no ring inside Only a small amber
block of rosin pristine and gleaming

Everybody smiles as Dovidl removes the rosin and swipes it
experimentally along his bow strings first with a stylish
upward flourish then with a downward He touches the rosin
to his lips

Gilbert and Zygmunt applaud It’s a subtle little ritual
whose meaning seems to have eluded ENID the giving of this
box partly a jeweller’s joke partly an expression of hope
partly a father’s farewell blessing

Blue - SoN D91 p13

With his ritualistic stroking of the bow Dovidl has
improvised a witty variation taking the rosin for a run as
it were as though the gift had been a Stradivarius The kiss
on the rosin is for his father whom he is aware he may never
see again For Peter Stemp 47 years later it will bea
magical ritual entirely without meaning

EXT SIMMONDS HOUSE DAY (A’39) 11

His cardboard suitcase at his feet Zygmunt is about to leave
for the bus stop first leg of his journey back to Poland -
to what we now know will be invasion occupation ghetto and
death camp - and though he doesn’t know what he’s returning
to Zygmunt seems to intuit it Hence the passion he puts
into his last tearful embrace of the son he may never see
again

To Martin and his parents watching from the doorstep this
is yet another public display of emotion that makes them
uncomfortable It isn’t anti-Semitism it isn’t coldness
it’s English reserve

INT HOTEL DINING ROOM GATESHEAD DAY (S’86) 12

The day following the competition Martin is lunching with
Peter Stemp and his mother ELLEN a woman of modest
means wearing her best two-piece for the occasion

On the table is The Northern Echo international and local
news with a Tyneside flavour several column inches given to
last night’s music competition picturing a toothy Maria
Korvinsky accepting her prize from Mayor Froggatt

ELLEN
So what’s this about You didn’t
give Peter the prize now we’re
having this posh lunch Why

MARTIN
That wasn’t my decision

ELLEN
You’d have made him the winner
then If it was up to you

MARTIN
The girl’s already there Mrs
Stemp Peter needs more time
better tuition
(attempting the casual)
Who’s been teaching him

ELLEN
He gets lessons in school I can’t
afford fancy teachers
Blue - SON D91 MARTIN
We could discuss that

ELLEN
Know a good cheap one do you

MARTIN
Several good none cheap

ELLEN
In South Shields

MARTIN
London

ELLEN
Just have to sell the yacht then
won’t I

MARTIN

I’ll find a way to cover Peter’s
tuition during his school holidays
And a family in London he can stay
with

Ellen looks to Peter He’s nodding Wants it

ELLEN
(indicates newspaper)
Why him Why not what’s-her-face

MARTIN
Her too

ELLEN
You think Pete’s that good then

MARTIN
He’1ll never be a Heifetz But he
could make a living with an
orchestra Or teaching
(to Peter)
Who’s been teaching you Peter

PETER
School

MARTIN
And who else You’ve had a few tips
off someone

Peter shrugs
MARTIN

That thing you do with the
rosin

Blue - SoN D91 p15

PETER
That’s for good luck I can stop

MARTIN
What’s his name Maybe I know him

A moment of hesitation then-

PETER
You don’t know him

MARTIN
I think I might He used to be a
virtuoso Did he tell you that

Peter smiling now

PETER
I don’t think so

MARTIN
DSark hair about my age

ELLEN
It’s not Pete you want is it

A harshness has entered her voice She’s worked it out The
bursary the promise of a management contract - they’re about
something other than Peter Stemp

ELLEN
Come on Pete We’re going
(to Martin)

Thanks for the dinner

Taking Peter by the hand she pulls him to his feet They
leave the dining room without looking back

INT MARTIN’S BEDROOM SIMMONDS HOUSE NIGHT (A’39) 15

This is the first time Martin and Dovidl have been left alone
together Dovidl is in the bedroom doorway with his cheap
suitcase between his feet waiting to be invited in

DOVIDL
(heavily accented)
I sleep here yes

MARTIN
No I don’t want you in my room I
like being on my own

DOVIDL
Is not your choose

MARTIN
Wrong clever It is my “choose” I
have to say if it’s all right and
if it isn’t you go back to Poland
and the Germans are going to invade
Poland You’ll have to wear a
yellow star and get bashed up by
brownshirts

DOVIDL
What is “bashed up” please

A pause

MARTIN
You better not snore that’s all

DOVIDL
What is snore

Martin does the sound for him Dovidl pulls a small notebook
and pencil from his pocket and records the word

DOVIDL
If I snore I snore in tune I am
musician You play
Blue - SoN D91 p17

MARTIN
Piano a bit

DOVIDL
Is good for accompanist Chess

MARTIN
A bit

DOVIDL

Everything for you is bit I am
genius I help you you will be bit
genius

MARTIN
Bet I could get you down

Dovidl’s pencil gets busy a second time Another new word

DOVIDL
What is “get down” please

Martin jumps him Operative definition

The boys wrestle grunting and snorting But eventually it’s
the wiry Dovidl who wrestles Martin to the ground and sits
on his chest pinning his arms

DOVIDL
Also fight a bit

MARTIN
(terminal frustration)
Bloody foreigner You can’t even
talk proper English

DOVIDL
You speak Polish Russian Yiddish
German Hebrew

MARTIN
I don’t have to I’m not one of
your lot

DOVIDL

What is “lot”

MARTIN
Foreigners We’re in England
stupid

Dovidl climbs off him retrieves his notebook wags it

INT GATESHEAD HOTEL BEDROOM MORNING (S’86) 16
Martin is eating a room-service breakfast at a small wheeled
table when there’s a tentative knock at the door He opens
to

PETER STEMP

MARTIN
Peter Where’s your mother

He checks the corridor No Ellen Came alone

PETER
I’1l take you to him

EXT GATESHEAD DAY (S’86) 17

They’ve come by taxi to an underpass entrance a pedestrian
tunnel beneath a busy urban road

EXTINT SUBWAY DAY (S’86) 18

As Martin and Peter descend the steps we’ll hear a distant
violin playing - with only moderate competence - The Rolling
Stones’ “Paint it Black”

Martin’s face falls Whoever is playing it isn’t Dovidl

As they get closer so does the music A turn in the tunnel
reveals

A BUSKER

The busker is BILLY an unkempt grizzly-bearded man in his
seventies wearing a stained raincoat football socks and
dirty plimsolls He’s playing on a cheap fiddle - complete
with unwanted echoes off the tiled walls On the floor at his
feet among the crisp packets and banana skins is his cap
dotted with a handful of low-value coins

Blue - SoN D91 p19

Though he’d known from the first bow-stroke that this could
not be Dovidl Martin wilts with disappointment

Billy nods an acknowledgement at Peter but barely glances at
Martin as he finishes the piece with a flourish of poorly
executed Kreisleresque slides Then out comes the rosin
followed by that ritualistic up-and-down stroking of the
bowstrings with which we’re becoming familiar and the
valedictory kiss to the rosin a magical ritual as
meaningless to Billy as it is to Peter

PETER
This is Mr Simmonds Billy He’s
gonna pay for me to have lessons
In London

BILLY
(London accent)
What did I tell you
(to Martin)
Told him he’d get discovered

MARTIN
He says you’ve been helping him

BILLY
(laughs )
Showed him a couple of things

MARTIN
Where did you learn to play

BILLY
Taught meself

Martin takes out his wallet Extracts a fiver drops it in
the hat

BILLY
That’s very kind of you sir

MARTIN
Teach yourself those Kreisler
slides did you Billy
Billy’s face sets

BILLY
Who wants to know

MARTIN
Your best customer
INT CAFE GATESHEAD DAY (S’86) 19

Billy Peter and Martin are drinking thick tea from thick
white mugs at a formica-topped table
Blue - SoN D91 p-20

BILLY
He never told me his name It was
years ago

MARTIN
Where did you meet him

BILLY
London I used to work the cinema
queues up west - when they had
cinema queues I wasn’t bad then-

MARTIN
What year

BILLY
(thinks)
High Noon When was that

MARTIN
‘52 I think Go on

BILLY
So I’m outside the Odeon yeah
playing the theme music - you know
from the film - and this cheeky
little bugger comes up tells me I
could do with some lessons ‘Oh
yeah’ I says ‘Who from’ ‘I don’t
normally give lessons’ he says
only he’s saving up for this trip
he wants to go on so how much can
I afford to pay him I told him to
get knotted Don’t even know he can
play do I

MARTIN
I assume he demonstrated

BILLY
Takes me violin right out me hand
You never heard nothing like it in
your life Magic Like something
off the wireless

(shakes his head in wonder)
Crowd starts chucking half crowns
ten-bob notes I give him half
Fair’s fair right

MARTIN
What did he look like

BILLY
Like he could do with a square
meal

Blue - SoN D91 p21

MARTIN
When was the last time you saw him

BILLY
Important is it

Martin deposits another fiver on the sticky table top

BILLY
He give me a few lessons Twice a
week for a bit One day he didn’t
turn up Never saw him again
Must’ve gone on his trip

MARTIN
Did he say where

BILLY
Didn’t make much sense like but
that’s why I remember it

Martin waits Billy waits Another fiver goes down

BILLY
Said he was going home to play for
the Ashes That’s cricket innit
When England plays Australia
(Martin nods)
Didn’t make sense ‘cos he didn’t
sound like an Aussie ‘Who’re you
then’ I says ‘Don bleeding
Bradman’

MARTIN
His exact words

Billy’s brow furrows with the effort of recall

BILLY
Something about a song Going home -
to play a song
(a beat)
For the ashes

ON MARTIN

This doesn’t mean anything to us but it contains a world of
meaning for Martin

INT SIMMONDS HOUSE NIGHT (A’39) 20
A family dinner is being eaten in silence as everybody
listens to the evening news on the wireless It’s a Friday

night and for Dovidl’s benefit there are Sabbath candles on
the table and a loaf of chala wrapped in a white cloth
Blue - SoN D91 p22

We should note that Dovidl’s dinner plate contains different
food from the others’ mostly vegetables

The news is all about the German Blitzkrieg of Poland the
bombing of Warsaw the collapse of the Polish army The
Phoney War is a few days old

Dovidl’s face reflects his struggle to contain his emotion
He’s learning to be English

GILBERT
I’m sure your family will be all
right David

ENID
Have you written home David
DOVIDL
I am writing letter
GILBERT
Good lad
DOVIDL

You permit I make more letter now

GILBERT
Permission granted old chap

As Dovidl prepares to leave the table-

MARTIN
He hasn’t finished his dinner

GILBERT
Special dispensation Go and finish
your letter David

Dovidl slides off his seat and leaves the room

MARTIN
It’s not fair

GILBERT
What isn’t

MARTIN
All this No bacon allowed in the
house no milk puddings special
food for the genius and he doesn’t
even have to eat it

ENID
If you’d like to take over

two weeks ago

ENID
It isn’t very nice Martin to tell
tales on a friend

MARTIN
My friends don’t wet the bed

The Simmonds adults exchange a look

GILBERT
Considering the position his family
is in I’d say wetting the bed is
the least we can expect from him

ENID
(to Martin)
Why don’t you go and see if you can
cheer him up

MARTIN
Didn’t look all that down to me

GILBERT
That’s a wicked thing to say Go to
your room

Not my room is it

He goes

INT LANDINGTHE BOYS’ BEDROOM NIGHT (A’39) 21

Through the partly open door we catch Dovidl looking at a
photograph and crying It’s a sepia studio portrait of the
Rapoport family taken in Warsaw in 1937 Dovidl’s father and
mother standing side by side in front of them Dovidl aged
seven between his two sisters Pessia and Malkeh Pessia has her arm around Dovidl’s shoulders Dovidl’s arm is
around Malkeh’s All five are solemn and unsmiling in the
portrait style of the time

As Martin enters Dovidl slides the photo under his pillow
Martin doesn’t see it Trying to recover his equilibrium
Dovidl blows his nose

DOVIDL
I have cold

A sudden unexpected shaft of compassion pierces Martin’s
juvenile soul

Blue - SoN D91 p24

MARTIN
Theyll be all right We’1ll smash
the Jerries up for you No-one
stands up to the British Army

DOVIDL
You are child
MARTIN
Play you a game of chess if you
want
DOVIDL
Chess with you takes my mind two
minutes
MARTIN
(a grin)

Three I feel lucky

EXT HAMPSTEAD DAY (A’39) 22

The two boys are freewheeling down a hill on their bikes
playing “chicken”

Martin is the first to swerve - avoiding a horse-drawn milk
float Dovidl sails on misses the float by inches and in
passing swipes a pint Riding no-hands he pierces the top
with his finger while still on the move and swigs from the
bottle

It’s Martin who gets nabbed by the milkman - momentarily
caught by his coat - before he breaks away and pedals madly
down the hill after Dovidl who has disappeared from view

MILKMAN
Thieving little bleeders

EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH DAY (A’39) 23

Martin finds Dovidl waiting in their private spot on the
Heath beneath a large tree overlooking the Ponds Eating a
Kit Kat NB Wartime issue blue wrapper dark chocolate

Grinning in triumph Dovidl offers Martin a finger of Kit
Kat

MARTIN
Thought you said these weren’t
kosher

DOVIDL

You rabbi now

Blue - SoN D91 p-25

MARTIN
Where’d you get it

DOVIDL
Your pocket

He proffers the milk bottle Martin takes a swig

DOVIDL
We make good team yes

Embarrassed by Dovidl’s open acknowledgement of what in a
London boy’s world should remain implicit Martin sprays him
with milk Dovidl responds by jumping on him playfully They
wrestle standing up for a few moments then both boys step
back to face one another and go by tacit agreement into their
slow motion boxers routine

This consists of each delivering in turn a slo-mo punch which
the other has the option either to dodge in slow motion or to
receive as a simulated blow rocking back under the pretended
impact with appropriate facial grimaces

INT HALLWAY PROFESSOR FLESCH’S STUDIO DAY (WINTER 1940) 24

Dovidl has come for his violin lesson accompanied by
GILBERT On the landing outside Flesch’s studio they meet
JOZEF WECHSLER about to descend He’s carrying a very
old violin case housing the virtuoso’s badge of office a
very old violin

JOZEF
Professor Flesch isn’t here I’ve
been waiting an hour

GILBERT
Do you know where he is

JOZEF
Back in Hungary probably He
thinks the Waffen SS are coming
over London Bridge

His glance finding Dovidl takes in his leatherette-covered
violin case doubtless containing a cheap violin

JOZEF
(to Gilbert with an
inclination of the head)
Jozef Wechsler Of Warsaw You will
have heard of me

GILBERT
Gilbert Simmonds I believe
Professor Flesch has mentioned you
Blue - SoN D91 p26

Dovidl’s look is one of undisguised envy Wechsler already
an international name at eighteen and with the arrogance of a
young god is who he wants to be - preferably tomorrow

DOVIDL
(to Jozef)
Dovid Eli Rapoport Also of Warsaw
Professor Flesch has spoken of you
to me also

JOZEF

He hasn’t spoken of you

(to Gilbert)

Your boy will need to find a new
teacher You know Dr Steiner of
Leipzig

GILBERT
I know of him

JOZEF
He has played Mozart with Einstein
He is in London now

DOVIDL
I learn physics I go Einstein

GILBERT
Mr Wechsler isn’t recommending
Einstein as a violin teacher
David

DOVIDL
I practise alone

JOZEF
And from whom will you learn
humility

DOVIDL
Not from you

With a sad shake of the head Jozef leaves

practise

GILBERT
Who will make sure you don’t skip
the tricky bits when your fingers
are hurting

Martin swings around on the piano stool

MARTIN
How about me

DOVIDL
Hah Boy of ten

MARTIN
Older than you

DOVIDL
Fifty-five days older

MARTIN
That’s six Kit Kats-

GILBERT
Boys Please It’s a very mature
undertaking

MARTIN
I’m more mature than he is

DOVIDL
Hah

This initiates another ritual Momentarily forgetting his
father’s presence Martin jumps off the stool and launches
into the slow motion boxers routine

GILBERT
Boys if you’ve finished
demonstrating your maturity -

They stop

GILBERT (CONT’D)
(to Martin)
Suppose some difficulty were to
arise that I needed to know about
and your friend asked you to keep
it from me Wouldn’t that be a
conflict of loyalties

Gilbert puts his arms around both boys’ shoulders

GILBERT

A longer pause

HELEN
So What did you find

MARTIN
Dovidl was still in London in 1952

HELEN
There’s a hot trail for you
Blue - SoN D91 p29

MARTIN
It means whatever his reason for
not turning up it wasn’t because
he was dead We never knew that for
sure before

HELEN
Just because he was alive thirty-
odd years ago doesn’t mean he is
now

MARTIN
He’s our age Why wouldn’t he be

HELEN
This going to be your new hobby
Martin Finding David after half a
lifetime so he can spit in your eye
again

MARTIN
If youd lost a brother-

HELEN

He wasn’t your brother

MARTIN
He felt like a brother

What

HELEN
To you

Same room as Scenes 25 and 26 same piano but with the
furnishings of the period complete with taped windows and
not-yet-drawn blackout curtains No lights are on and the
room is gloomy

Barely able to see his music Martin is at the piano
accompanying Dovidl playing chords to which Dovidl is
practising his staccato technique

Suddenly Dovidl stops playing Martin carries on for a moment
or two before he registers this Then he too stops swivels
on the stool to face Dovidl

MARTIN
I didn’t say you could stop

DOVIDL
My neck is hurting

NB Dovidl’s English is already far less heavily accented

Gilbert enters the room wearing an ARP armband (Air Raid

GILBERT
Sorry to interrupt boys

He crosses to the window closes the blackout curtains
switches on the light

GILBERT (CONTD)

along well with Mr Cohen

DOVIDL

He joined up RAF

GILBERT
Yes I know Important that you
keep on with your religious
studies I promised your father

As Gilbert turns away

DOVIDL
They do not say Hebrew words same
as in Poland Mr Simmonds

GILBERT
Then

He’s about to recommend that Dovidl learn the British style
of pronunciation but in that instant realises that the
European style may soon cease to exist

GILBERT
Say them the way you were taught in
Poland

DOVIDL
Thank you Mr Simmonds

Jozef has settled among the crowd camped as far as possible
from the Simmondses

As Martin Gilbert and Enid busy themselves spreading
blankets and pillows Dovidl removes his modest little violin
from its case He strokes the bowstrings with his block of
Warsaw rosin kisses the rosin then casually begins to play
a jaunty classical piece

Yellow - SoN D93 p34-34A

Gilberts face displays pride Jozef is trying to show amused
indifference But it seems there’s only so much a genius can
stand Unable to resist Jozef at last takes up his own
venerable instrument and joins in merging seamlessly with
Dovidl There is no apparent disparity in skill between these
two performers and what at first seems a co-operative
exercise soon grows savagely competitive-

-as Jozef switches suddenly to a more demanding piece-

-and Dovidl matches him effortlessly bar for bar finesse
for finesse-

-and Dovidl switches to a notoriously tricky Paganini caprice-
-and Jozef meets the challenge unerringly
Both of them smiling

Jozef thinking ‘This kid’s not half bad’

ANGLE FROM TAXI - MARTIN’S POV 1986 WARSAW CITYSCAPE

This is a Warsaw far removed from the pre-war city Dovidl
would have known as a boy but not much different from the one
he visited in 1953 except that Solidarnosc flags and
hoardings proliferate along the roadside and on the facades
of buildings

The TAXI DRIVER is a man in his seventies The car radio is
playing softly in the background

towards it He stoops to retrieve something shiny He holds
it up for Martin to see A silver bracelet

MARTIN
Has it got a name on it

Dovidl shakes his head Pockets the bracelet

He moves out of sight behind the wall which has a carpeted
staircase still intact against it

Martin pulls a Kit Kat bar from his pocket unwraps it and
takes a bite surveying the wreckage as he munches A moment
or two passes then Dovidl reappears a purse in his hand

MARTIN
(horrified)
What are you doing

DOVIDL
It’s Mrs Harris She’s on my paper
round The face is gone but I
recognise the purse

He opens the purse and with a triumphant yell extracts a
pound note

Martin is scowling

A few moments of awkward silence pass before Bailey returns
holding a worn violin case and a bow He sets the case down
and extracts the instrument

At the sight of it Dovidl’s eyes gleam with avarice

BAILEY
This is a Nicolo Gagliano filio

He hands bow and violin to Dovidl who receives them with the
reverence due a holy relic

Forced laughter from the two men If Gilbert is aware how
cruel he’s being to his natural son he isn’t showing it

But Dovidl is too distracted to spare a thought for Martin
He’s examining the instrument with a lustful eye

Taking the ring box from his pocket he extracts his block of
rosin swipes the bowstrings with it - once up once down -
then kisses the rosin Bailey shoots Gilbert an enquiring
look but no explanation is offered

Dovidl has tucked the Gagliano under his chin and is testing
its range and resonance playing short snatches of music in
various styles and in rapid succession

bizarrely from a branch by the loose end of one its strings

MARTIN
My father thinks you’ve topped
yourself

Dovidl smiles

DOVIDL
Against my religion

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Prodigal quasi-son wanted home
Dov

DOVIDL
Goody Quasi-fatted calf for din-

MARTIN
You really are a cold bastard you
know that

It’s that thing I’m killing the
varnished tyrant I’m glad you
came Murder needs witnesses

Noticing the photograph Martin picks it up and studies it

Why haven’t I seen this

DOVIDL
It’s how I’ve kept them safe
Hiding them From everyone

MARTIN
I’m not everyone

Martin picks it up studies it

MARTIN
Which one’s Malkeh

Dovidl points

DOVIDL
She’s five there Pessia was nine

MARTIN
What was it like That life

DOVIDL

Still Life with Jews Boys playing
football old men praying ritual
baths for the women Malkeh was too
young for that so she would stay
home - I’d play her a lullaby at
bedtime My father would wander the
streets - every day Mottl imagine
- every evening except the sabbath -
selling his jewellery pieces he
made while the rest of us were
asleep Just so we could eat
Sometimes we didn’t

Emotion catches him by the throat

MARTIN
It’s only presumption of death Why
your rabbi won’t let you say
kiddish right

Dovidl manages a smile

DOVIDL
Kiddush is the blessing over wine
I can still say that This is the
Kaddish

DOVIDL
Do you think I’d go mad if I knew
for certain Strip off and run
naked through the streets like
Wechsler waving my violin
“Israelites to your bows The
Philistines are upon us”

MARTIN
I don’t think he did that

DOVIDL
Can’t see it working in Hampstead

MARTIN
Wechsler started out half barmy

DOVIDL
And I’m not

MARTIN
You’ve got me

DOVIDL
A stabilising influence

MARTIN
Ordinary and boring

DOVIDL
Good for leaning on Like this

MARTIN
Nice to know I’m good for
something

DOVIDL

Stop fishing for compliments
Mottl This is my life crisis not
yours

MARTIN
Hey how about a joint life crisis
Joint suicide note We don’t have
to do it just drive my father
nuts

Dovidl laughs

Itd be exactly the right

INT ASYLUM WARSAW DAY (S’86)

Nothing much has changed here since the place was built in
the 1920s Martin makes his way along a corridor of glossy
brown tiled walls and shiny linoleum floors to a
receptionist’s window where he shows a piece of paper

bearing Jozef Wechsler’s name to a MALE RECEPTIONIST After
staring at the name for long seconds the receptionist points

along the corridor

INT ASYLUM VISITING ROOM DAY (S’86)

Martin has been directed to a small bare room with an iron

grille over its single high window and walls covered in
faded yellowed paint more than sixty years old

JOZEF WECHSLER (now 65) is wheeled in by a NURSE almost as

old as the asylum itself She positions him under the window

Haggard and sallow looking nearer eighty Jozef is rocking

rhythmically to and fro in his wheelchair as though in
mockery of Jewish prayer his long once-nimble fingers
fiddling compulsively with the buttons of his striped

pyjamas Nobody here has thought to avoid the cruel irony of
those stripes upon a Jewish patient bereaved into madness by

the Holocaust

Martin has brought grapes Handing them to the nurse he
pulls up a hard upright chair and seats himself by Jozef
The nurse remains standing

MARTIN
Jozef Do you remember me
Martin Simmonds From London

No response from Jozef

MARTIN (CONTD)
David Rapoport was my foster
brother

(MORE )
Blue - SON D91 MARTIN (CONTD)
You and he played together during
an air raid - in Hampstead
(no reaction from Jozef)
You came here with my father on a
concert tour after the war

Jozef seems entirely unaware of his presence
Martin appeals silently to the nurse for help

NURSE
You are friend from Pan Wechsler

MARTIN
I knew him in London before
Before Does he understand me

NURSE
Sometimes he remembers
(to Jozef)
Your friend has come far for to see
you Jozef

Jozef still rocking back and forth says nothing

MARTIN
(to nurse)
Don’t you have any pyjamas that
aren’t striped

NURSE

EXT WARSAW APARTMENT BLOCKS DAY (S’86) 46

Were in an area of post-war apartment blocks in pale
colours with a few green verges Could be anywhere

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT BUILDING DAY (S’86) 47

Entering one of the buildings Martin climbs five flights of

iron-banistered stairs to the fifth floor This time we might
think he’s close the elusive Dovidl perhaps only a few steps
away

He rings a doorbell Waits

The door is opened - though only partially - by a tall
slender woman with high cheekbones blue eyes a small
straight nose and short blonde hair recruiting poster for
the mature Aryan matron ANNA WOZNIAK 50 but looking
younger

MARTIN
Pani Wozniak Anna Wozniak

A nod slightly suspicious Despite Solidarnosc and the thaw
it has already begun to bring the secret police are still
active in 1986 they come in all guises

MARTIN
Do you speak English

Another nod

MARTIN (CONTD)
I’m told you might be able to help
me

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT DAY (S’86) 48

Like the Simmonds house this is the living space of a
cultured person on a strict budget many books few
furnishings

ANNA
I hardly know Pan Wechsler I visit
him as a duty

MARTIN
One day a year June 15th
Blue - SoN D91 p52

ANNA
Yes

MARTIN
Mind if I ask why

ANNA
Why do you want to know

MARTIN
I’m trying to find someone who knew
him in London Another violinist
David Rapoport

Anna’s reaction tells Martin he’s struck gold

MARTIN
You know him

ANNA
(realization)
You are Martin

48A INT ANNA’S APARTMENT DAY - LATER (S’86) 48A

CLOSE ON a framed portrait of Pope John Paul II hanging on a
wall and a simple wooden crucifix fixed above it

Martin is looking at them as Anna returns to the room with a
coffee tray

ANNA
David came the year your queen was
coronated I lived then on Dzielna
where he grew up It is how we met

MARTIN
How long did he stay in Warsaw

ANNA
A few months He was not allowed a
visa for very long

MARTIN
Any idea where he went after that

ANNA
This he did not tell me

Though Anna is more forthcoming now that she knows who Martin
is we sense that she’s not yet entirely trusting

She sees that he’s looking at the crucifix
Blue - SoN D91 p-53

ANNA
They are allowed in private homes
I took them down when David was
with me

There’s an implication of intimacy in “with me” that Martin
doesn’t acknowledge

ANNA (CONTD)
It would not have pleased him to
see them I think

MARTIN

No he’s not a big fan of religion
ANNA

Your friend is a soul on pause

Is there a word for that
Martin shakes his head unsure what she means
ANNA (CONTD)

Believing one thing another thing
nothing - all at the same time

MARTIN
Agnostic

She shakes her head

MARTIN (CONTD)
Ambivalent

ANNA
Yes David was ambivalent

49 EXT NORTH LONDON STREETS EARLY MORNING (S’47)

The boys are walking to the synagogue early on a summer’s
morning Dovidl carrying a velvet prayer bag

MARTIN
What’s this thing I’m supposed to
witness

DOVIDL
A ceremony

MARTIN
Not another bar mitzvah

DOVIDL
Not quite

MARTIN
Bit early to raise one of those
quorum thingies

Blue - SoN D91 p54

DOVIDL
This doesn’t need a minyan Just a
witness

MARTIN

Nice to count for once

DOVIDL
Probably not to God Mottl Only to
me

MARTIN

Do you think He knows where your
family is God

DOVIDL
Oh He knows He just won’t say
Would Jesus if you asked him

Martin smiles

MARTIN
Why Thinking of converting

DOVIDL
Jews can’t convert

MARTIN
Disraeli did

DOVIDL
Disraeli was baptised Wetting his
head didn’t wash the Jew out of
him Or out of Jesus Ethnicity
isn’t soluble in water Mottl
Religion - well that’s a coat
When it gets too hot you can take
it off

They arrive at the synagogue and enter

INT SYNAGOGUE EARLY MORNING (S’47) 50

Empty pews unoccupied bimah a few stragglers leaving after
the Shacharit service The red glow of the Eternal Light over
the Ark signifies the continuing presence of God

MARTIN
You just lost your minyan
Blue - SoN D91 p-55

DOVIDL
No this is perfect
(indicating the Eternal
Light)
He’s here The ceremony’s for Him

He pulls from his prayer bag a striped silk tallith which he
drapes about his neck and the embroidered kippah he wore at
his bar mitzvah which he places on his head

DOVIDL (CONTD)

(to Martin)
Listen and don’t interrupt

(intoning to the Eternal

Light)

Hear O Israel and the God of
Israel On this nineteenth day of
Sivan in the year 5707 in London
in the presence of Martin Simmonds
also of London I David Eli
Rapoport son of Zygmunt and Esther
Rapoport of Warsaw do freely and
of my own will renounce the faith
of my forefathers

MARTIN
What are you doing

DOVIDL
Converting Be quiet

MARTIN
To what

DOVIDL

Nothing

(continuing his ceremony)
I do most solemnly renounce and
repudiate now and for ever in the
name of the surviving the reviled
and discredited faith of the
perished the faith of Abraham
Isaac and Jacob

MARTIN
This isn’t funny Dov-

DOVIDL

the accursed faith of the
despised the mocked the
persecuted the slaughtered the
faith abandoned by Jesus Thus do I
renounce the Torah and Talmud Thus
do I divorce myself from the
community of Israel

Dipping into his bag he extracts a knife With the prayer
shawl still around his neck he begins to cut it into pieces

Blue - SoN D91 p-56

Martin has stepped back in horror Though not himself a
practising Christian he knows the momentousness of self-
excommunication

MARTIN
YOU CAN’T DO THIS

DOVIDL
-And as I separate this garment
so do I separate myself now and
for all time from the beliefs
practices traditions rituals and
obligations of Zion

The tallith has drifted from his neck in tatters Pulling the
skull cap from his head Dovidl cuts it in half and drops the
pieces at his feet

DOVIDL (CONT’D)
Amen

His footsteps resonate on the tiled floor as he leaves

Martin stares silently after him

EXT BALCONY OF ANNA’S APARTMENT WARSAW DUSK (S’86) 51

Anna has brought Martin on to the balcony of her apartment

ANGLE THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBOURHOOD

A reconstructed square of post-war apartment blocks built on

the site of the razed ghetto a site as displaced in time as

that of any ancient battlefield this one echoless by design
MARTIN

If this is where the Ghetto was
where are the ruins

ANNA
Where the past belongs Under the
ground

MARTIN

So he just left didn’t say where
he was going

ANNA
Must we have these interrogations
Martin like a Sherlock Holmes
story

MARTIN
It’s why I’m here

Where was he staying Didn’t he
come to say goodbye

Over dinner vodka flowing freely-

Blue - SoN D91 p57

MARTIN
He used you You know that

ANNA
Martin I loved your friend It’s
how you live with people you don’t
always like By loving them

MARTIN
Loving Dovidl’s a mistake

ANNA
We don’t choose who to love

MARTIN
(anger building)
Trusting him’s a mistake You can’t
trust them

ANNA
Them

MARTIN
Artists They die they disappear
they leave you They don’t
understand love or loyalty

ANNA
You must stop looking for him
Martin It would not be good to
find him

Blue - SoN D91 p-58

MARTIN
For him or me

ANNA
Both If he wanted to be found
don’t you think he would have come
to you long ago

The anger that has been building in Martin bursts out

MARTIN
We thought he was dead My father
gave up on life when he
disappeared Had a stroke two
months later It killed him

ANNA
David told me of your friendship
Not how it ended

Reaching across the table Anna covers Martin’s hand with her
own

ANNA (CONTD)

He is the soloist We are the
accompanists He took our light We
have none of our own

MARTIN
I don’t accept that

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT NIGHT (S’86) 54

DISCOVER MARTIN in bed with Anna Post-coital For him it’s
as though he has performed the act under some irresistible
compulsion Anna senses it

ANNA
You have never done this before
Been unfaithful to your wife

MARTIN
No

ANNA
How does it feel
Blue - SoN D91 p59

MARTIN
Like betrayal

He turns his head to look at her Is this why she lured him
into her bed To show him the obverse face of betrayal She
reads the question in his eyes

MARTIN
Where did he go when he left
Poland Anna

ANNA
Again this I told you he did not
say

MARTIN

I don’t believe you
He points at a crucifix over the bed

MARTIN (CONTD)
Swear on that

ANNA
Oh Martin that cross has heard
more lies than Goebbels’
bathroom mirror

MARTIN
Swear anyway

ANNA
I swear on the holy cross he did
not tell me where he went

MARTIN
Why do you visit Wechsler

ANNA
I told you this also I go in place
of David

MARTIN
How often did he go

ANNA
Once only To play for him the
Song June 15th 1953 He never
went again

MARTIN
What song

ANNA
Martin it’s why David came to
Poland To play the music where the
ashes are It was his obsession

Blue - SoN D91 p60

Anna drives in and stops by a sculpture representing railway
tracks at the entrance to the symbolic cemetery Beyond the
memorials the forest can be seen encroaching at the
perimeter still raw undressed startled by discovery

Anna shuts off the engine

ANNA
This is where I waited None of
this was here Only fields some
railway tracks

MARTIN
Did he tell you about his family
Pessia would have been fifteen
Malkeh ten or eleven They never
appeared on any lists We
encouraged him to keep hoping
Maybe we shouldn’t have

ANNA
He never spoke of them To David
Jews were not Poles I ama Pole I
live where he lived I stole his
life To him I am one of the
persecutors

representing an annihilated Jewish community

Neither Anna nor Martin speaks as they wander among the
stones reading the names of villages towns cities here
only the dead do the talking Martin stops by the largest
stone of all inscribed “WARSZAWA” contemplates it in
silence

went in a taxi to the airport to
return it

MARTIN
And send him the money
Blue - SoN D91 p-62

ANNA

The money I was to keep
MARTIN

Did you
ANNA

It was not mine to sell
MARTIN

His either
ANNA

That is why he took it back

Retrieving his bag from the back seat Martin opens the
passenger door Unsure how to conduct the valediction

MARTIN
So I suppose this is goodbye

ANNA

I never lied to you Martin He
never told me where he was going

(moment of decision)
When I was giving him the violin a
flight was called Suddenly he was
in a hurry

(a beat)
The flight was to New York

ON MARTIN a surge of excitement pulsing through him a trail
thirty-three years cold but still a trail

MARTIN
(kissing her)
Thank you

I hope you find him but I hope
you do not

JAUNTY JEWISH BAND MUSIC OVER - the Hora Nayeem played with
some unusual strings riffs-

INT DANCE HALL LONDON NIGHT (MAY 1948) 60
ON DOVIDL the source of the riffs

Having joined the band for the length of the song he is
seated cross-legged on the floor in front of the cellist
bowing the strings while the cellist does the fingering a
party trick which is drawing loud applause from everyone in
the hall

HELEN and MARTIN (both 18 here) are watching this Helen with
fascination She hasn’t met Dovidl yet

The occasion is a celebratory dance the hall hung with
Israeli flags portraits of Ben-Gurion a banner declaring
the date (May 14th 1948) and proclaiming the birth of the
State of Israel

In one corner a recruitment stand has been set up a couple
of tanned sabras in khaki shirts enjoining North Londoners to
enlist in the new army to fight the massed Arab hordes
preparing to destroy their infant nation “ISRAEL NEEDS YOU”
reads the sign
Blue - SoN D91 p-65

The song ends and Dovidl makes his way through the crowd to

old Dovidl pictured and most prominent the sleeve to the
promotional recording referred to in Scene 1 featuring
Dovidl’s rendering of the BACH PARTITAS which we’1ll hear

that’s tricky to read transportation nostalgia dislike
regret and something else

A strengthening gale is blowing as Martin rides through the
suburban streets of Crown Heights in a yellow cab past shops
bearing Hebrew and Yiddish lettering bearded long-coated
men clutching their wide-brimmed hats and fedoras against the
wind as they go to and from the yeshiva on Eastern Parkway

It’s the last place in America Martin would expect to find
the apostate Dovidl Plainly it’s the wrong Gagliano unless
its owner bought it from Dovidl

The cab pulls up outside a house

ultra-orthodox style peeps from behind her legs

The light thrown from the interior reveals a mezuzah on the
doorpost

MARTIN
Sorry to bother you but I was given
this address

Taking in Martin’s appearance - not ultra-orthodox therefore
someone to be suspicious of - she manoeuvres the boy
protectively behind her

MARTIN (CONTD)
I’m looking for a violin

BROCHE BROCHE
Gay holen deyn tate Go fetch your father

The boy dashes back into the house calling-

ZYGMUNT (JR)
Tatti

MARTIN
a Gagliano-

He breaks off as the man of the house appears the boy behind
him clutching his legs Following them are a girl of six and
another a year younger crowding to see who the stranger is
at the door

Blue - SoN D91 p72

The man is Martin’s age his hair and beard still thick and
black the beard framing a face still handsome a jawline not
in the least jowly He wears the long black coat of an ultra-
orthodox Jew and beneath it a collarless white shirt But
he’s instantly recognisable

DOVIDL
You took your time Mottl

MARTINS REACTION

He’s hardly able to believe that this is Dovidl yet so
constrained is he by the circumstances of the encounter that
he’s unable to react freely All he can do is shake his head
in wonder

DOVIDL
As you see I took off the coat I
put it back on

So saying he pulls a long black coat from a hook by the door
and shrugs into it as he steps outside closing the door
behind him shutting Martin away from his life

INT DOVIDL’S CAMPER (TRAVELLING) NIGHT (S’86) 68

It’s a battered old camper and there’s silence inside it
disturbed only by engine and wind noise as driven by Dovidl
with Martin beside him it rattles through the streets of
Brooklyn

In Martin’s face we’ll see thirty-five years of pent-up
anger perplexity and frustration waiting for expression in
Dovidl’s face as he drives there is nothing readable

Eventually Dovidl pulls in at a lonely parking spot
overlooking the East River

EXT EAST RIVER OVERLOOK NIGHT (S’86) 69
On a night like this Dovidl’s is the only vehicle in the
parking area

INT DOVIDL’S CAMPER NIGHT (S’86) 70
Dovidl sets the hand brake and cuts the motor The silence is
disturbed now only by the wind and the ticking of the cooling
engine Dovidl turns finally to face Martin

and receives full force in his face A FLURRY OF REPEATED
HARD BLOWS which split his lip and draw blood from his mouth

and nose

Dovidl makes no attempt to dodge the blows or shield himself
from them
Yellow - SoN D93 p-73

He just sits there and receives them as his due Though this
is a far cry from their old slow-motion boxers ritual the
moment should echo it darkly

Breathing hard Martin finally sinks back in the passenger

sea

t Dovidl dabs at his bleeding face with his sleeve

With a shake of the head Martin pulls from his pocket a

nea

tly folded clean pocket handkerchief Brushing Dovidl’s

hand aside he takes over the dabbing with this

After a few moments Dovidl appropriates the handkerchief and

con
Mar

tinues wiping his own blood but in doing so notices that
tin’s knuckles are bleeding too Abandoning his own

injuries he wraps the handkerchief around Martin’s hand

ins

tead Blood brotherhood No words spoken Until-

DOVIDL
Say it Mottl Say what’s on your
mind It’ll make you feel better

MARTIN
Youve no fucking idea Do you Why
did you do it

DOVIDL
I’m not sure you’d understand

MARTIN
I didn’t expect it to be you
Tonight when I came about the
violin You were the last person in
the world I expected to find

DOVIDL
When I abandoned the Holy One it
took Him four years to find me
It’s taken you thirty-five
(a smile)

Not bad
MARTIN
God didn’t punish you I will
DOVIDL
So will He in time blessed be His
name
MARTIN

My father put everything he had

into you you ungrateful bastard

Hebrew lessons bacon-less

breakfasts pudding-less dinners

bar mitzvah fucking Gagliano
(MORE )

Yellow - SoN D93 p74

MARTIN (contd)
and that concert - he didn’t even
insure it didn’t think he needed
to He treated you like his
favourite fucking son - for twelve
years - and you buggered off
without a word He thought you were
dead He lost everything that
night Two months later he died
with your name on his lips

This revelation shocks Dovidl into silence He opens the
driver’s door and steps out into the gale to process it

MARTIN’S POV - DOVIDL BATTERED BY THE WIND COAT TAILS FLYING
Dovidl re-enters

DOVIDL
Do you remember what you said the
last time I saw you “Get laid”
you said

EXTINT BUS DAY (A’51) 73

The driver leaves the bus thinking all his passengers have
departed It’s one of several buses lined up empty in the

Dovidl wakes on the top deck of the empty bus He makes his
way down the winding staircase and into the street where
it’s raining heavily

EXT STOKE NEWINGTON HIGH STREET DAY (A’51) 74

The street is adjacent to Stoke Newington Market
Stallholders are covering their goods and packing up early
all too busy to be approached for directions Dovidl wanders
past in the rain carrying his cased Gagliano no idea where
he is except that it’s a Jewish neighbourhood - past barrels
of pickled cucumbers marble slabs of herring - transported
by sights sounds and smells reminiscent of the Warsaw of his
childhood

He turns a corner and finds himself at a dead end a
railway embankment Hopelessly lost

But there’s a shop on a corner Frumkin’s

INT FRUMKIN’S DAY (A’51) 75

One either side of a marble counter the shop’s proprietor
FRUMKIN - a tubular man in a soiled apron - is deep in
argument with KATZENBERG a black-bearded black-coated
customer Their argument Talmudic in character is being
conducted in Yiddish (subtitled)

Dovidl glances at his watch He has a concert to prepare for
Has he time for this whatever it is But the decision is
made for him Stretching his arm around Dovidl’s shoulders
Katzenberg leads him out into the street

EXT YOUNG REBBE’S SYNAGOGUE DAY (A’51) 76

An alley leads them to what appears from the outside to be an
ordinary residential house somewhat run-down but as
Katzenberg and Dovidl enter both saturated from the rain-

INT YOUNG REBBE’S SYNAGOGUE DAY (A’51) 77

-we see that the ground-floor partition walls have been
removed to create a large low-ceilinged prayer hall
furnished like a synagogue and consecrated as one supported
by steel beams and pillars Around twenty men and youths (no
women) are swaying in prayer

Katzenberg strides to the bimah and slaps his hand loudly on
the lectern

KATZENBERG KATZENBERG
Inz habmir do a Rapoport fin We have a Rapoport from
Warshe Warsaw

Instantly the praying stops A smooth-cheeked BOY of thirteen
slips out of the room

ON DOVIDL understanding none of this He looks to Katzenberg
for an explanation but receives none

Almost immediately the boy returns With him is a bearded man
in his thirties THE YOUNG REBBE

Though twice this man’s age Katzenberg inclines his head
respectfully in his presence

KATZENBERG KATZENBERG

Blue - SoN D91 p78

He gestures Dovidl and Katzenberg seat themselves The
entire congregation now strikes an attitude of attention
Prayer books are closed backs straightened

The Young Rebbe climbs the steps to an elevated bimah on
which there is a lectern and on the lectern alongside the
Torah a large privately-bound book the size of a ledger

Katzenberg speaks softly to Dovidl in Yiddish while the Rebbe
opens the ledger and reverently begins turning its pages

KATZENBERG KATZENBERG

David nods impatient now for the mere chance of knowing
after a decade of ignorance and speculation

The Rebbe begins to chant a recitation

What he chants - a musical theme based on traditional laments
- is The Song of Names in Yiddish as it was originally
remembered a partial list of the dead of Treblinka

The melody should be so soulful so powerful so immediately
arresting that at first audition it will burn itself
indelibly into the memory of all who hear it

Looking up seeing Dovidl’s face the Rebbe halts his song
ON DOVIDL

his eyes awash Here for the first time in this most
unlikely of settings a place to which he has come seemingly
by accident he has heard at last the names of his family
included in the roll of the dead confirmed what until now
was only a supposition He has closure Nothing in his life
will ever be the same again

Katzenberg’s arm once more enfolds the grieving Dovidl as he
weeps unashamed among these strangers of his tribe

INT DOVIDL’S CAMPER NIGHT (S’86) 78

Here it’s Martin’s eyes that have filled
Yellow - SoN D93 p-80

Lashed by gusts of wind the camper rocks on its springs
back and forth as though itself dovening A week-old
newspaper flies against the windscreen and briefly plasters
itself across it before taking wing again the past
momentarily obliterating the present

DOVIDL

They set the names to music to make
them easier to remember This is
oral tradition Mottl It gave us
the Torah passed down mouth to ear
for a hundred generations It’s the
chain I cannot break

The two little girls you saw at my
house were named for my sisters
Malkeh and Pessia My son I named
for his grandfather Zygmunt On
Yom HaShoah each year I say Kaddish
for them

(a pause)
Do you know what one of the worst
fears was for those in the camps
It wasn’t dying It was dying with
their entire family Leaving no-one
behind to say Kaddish for their
souls

A long silence follows

MARTIN
I’m glad it brought you peace It
doesn’t explain why you never
wrote never phoned never sent a
message Why did you cut us out
of your life In all those years
did you ever give any of us a
thought

Helen rolls her eyes as if to say “What do Jews do instead
of crossing their fingers”

MARTIN is wiping the sweat from his face with an already
sodden handkerchief tears of frustration starting to gleam
in his eyes How could he have been such a fool

And then like an apparition

DOVIDL is there in the wings with them

Tonight he’s wearing a dark suit a discreet skullcap on the

back of his head Gagliano and bow in his hand Comme il

I hope you didn’t mind waiting
thirty-five years

Relieved audience laughter

Dovidl nods to the conductor The orchestra begins its
introduction

ON MARTIN with the programme in his hand holding his

breath Nightmare visions of disaster are crowding his brain -
visions of some popular tin-ear monstrosity being played for
ironical effect

But then his eyes close his breath is expelled with relief
as he hears the opening notes of the Bruch as advertised

playing the final notes of the Bruch He has performed to a

high professional standard yet there’s something missing

in his playing and that something is feeling the personal

engagement of the artist’s soul which distinguishes the very
good from the truly great

HELEN
(grudgingly)
He can still play I’1l give him

Yeah he was good

Dovidl is bowing to the audience leaving the stage to
appreciative but not overwhelming applause The audience

Good crap though

Dovidl smiles

DOVIDL
Wait fifteen minutes

He disappears to his dressing room

HELEN
Is it me or isn’t he being just a
little too compliant

Martin nods his agreement A similar sense of foreboding has
gripped him too a fear that Dovidl’s uncharacteristic
compliance so far may have been a magician’s misdirection
presaging some outrageous act of rebellion still to come And
since the concert’s second half is scheduled to be a solo
performance without orchestra Dovidl will have all the
latitude he needs to go rogue

INT CONCERT HALL AUDITORIUM NIGHT (A’86) 92

The second half of the concert is about to commence The
audience has returned and is waiting expectantly clearing
its collective throat Unaccompanied solo performances are
the acid test nobody to cover the violinist’s mistakes

ANGLE ON MARTIN AND HELEN

standing now at the back of the hall All the tension we saw
in them before the concert has returned in the last fifteen
minutes

Now Dovidl makes his second entrance Wearing this time to
the amusement of all the long black coat and fedora of ultra-
orthodox uniform

Blue - SoN D91 p92

Something’s coming and it isn’t Bach We know what it is
what it has to be We’ve known it for some while

As Dovidl waits for the embarrassed titters to die away we’1ll
witness for the last time that now-familiar ritual the long
upward sweep of the rosin the long downward sweep and
finally the blessing of his lips

Setting his bow gently to the Gagliano - the gesture of a
lover - Dovidl opens with a single note so pure and mournful
so protracted so tender that even in this initial stroking
of the instrument we realize that the first half of the
concert wasn’t misdirection at all it was foreplay This
though they don’t know it yet is what the audience came for

Many of them are checking their programmes puzzled as is
Martin not to be hearing Bach

ON MARTIN AND HELEN
They exchange a look Uh-oh

And now for the first time we’ll hear David Eli Rapoport’s
solo violin version of The Song of Names composed in 1952 in
London in fidelity to his vow a complex exquisitely
harmonized arrangement of the simple sung melody that changed
his life

It should be at once unbearably soulful immediately
memorable and technically stunning a masterwork of nuance
and colour and shadow a description in music of a People’s
suffering delivered via the ear to the blood

At first we’ll hear only the single voice of the Gagliano
playing the original sung melody

INT WARSAW ASYLUM DAY (S’53) 93

and then a second violin enters in harmony - playing a
variation on the melody - as we see DOVIDL play The Song
of Names for JOZEF WECHSLER (32 here but looking fifty)

Outside the room Anna can be seen listening to Dovidl’s
playing

EXT TREBLINKA DAY (S’53) 94

Yet another variation as the voice of a third violin joins
the other two while Dovidl “plays for the ashes” in the
barren field that covers his family’s bones

IN SHOT in the background by the original railway tracks as
yet devoid of symbolic representation Anna waits in her car
not the Polski probably a Trabant

Blue - SoN D91 p93

INT YOUNG REBBE’S SYNAGOGUE (SYNAGOGUE) DAY (S’51) 95
Finally the trio of violins come together now heard to choir
accompaniment as they merge into a single piece in perfect
harmony with the sung melody in the Stoke Newington
synagogue

Here we reprise the scene of Dovidl’s epiphany - the Young
Rebbe chanting the names to the same melody the congregation
responding

INT CONCERT HALL NIGHT (A’86) 96
BACK TO SCENE

CU DOVIDL

as he finishes playing The Song of Names in public for the
first and only time

He draws out the final perfect melancholy note as long as
possible before fading slowly to silence

Then nothing
THE AUDIENCE - stunned into a silence of their own
MARTIN - moved beyond the capacity to move

When seconds later the audience recovers itself their
applause lifts the roof

Dovidl bows low Then leaves the stage There will be no
encore There will be no return

The rest is coda

INT DRESSING ROOM NIGHT (A’86) 97

Martin has come with Helen to Dovidl’s dressing room the
door of which stands ajar

They step inside Nobody here no sign of occupancy Just a
discarded suit over the back of a chair on its seat the
cased Gagliano and on the violin case-

AN ENVELOPE ADDRESSED TO MARTIN

Glittering on the floor inside the threshold are THE
SHATTERED REMAINS OF A BLOCK OF ROSIN

Helen’s eyes go to the envelope Martin’s to the scattering
of bright yellow shards

Blue - SoN D91 p94

DOVIDL’S VOICE (V0)
My dearest Mottl you’1ll remember
how I was forbidden to say Kaddish
for my family until their deaths
were confirmed and the anguish this
caused me It saddened me more than
I can say to learn from you that my
disappearance had caused that same
anguish in your father Above all
things I want you to be spared
it

INT HOTEL LOBBY NIGHT (A’86) 98

Martin has come to the hotel to confirm that Dovidl is no
longer there The receptionist is confirming it showing
Martin the duplicate of Dovidl’s check-out invoice

DOVIDL’S VOICE (V0)

--Two months ago when you found
me I told you I no longer lived a
life you would recognise I no
longer thought of myself as an
individual which an artist is
required to be I chose instead to
submerge myself within a community
of faith

EXT DOVIDL’S HOUSE BROOKLYN MORNING (A’86) 99
Well recognise it from Sc 67 A phone is ringing inside

DOVIDL’S VOICE (V0)
-It’s a social organism we borrow
from nature a body sharing a
common history common values and a
common memory to which the price
of admission is the surrender of
self

INT SIMMONDS HOUSE MARTIN’S HOME OFFICE DAY (’86) 100

Martin is phoning from his home office The single American
ring tone in his ears

DOVIDL’S VOICE (V0)
-it’s the most enduring of
families impossible to extinguish
We take care of one another in ways
that natural families cannot
Blue - SoN D91 p95

101 INT CROWN HEIGHTS HOUSE MORNING (A’86) 101

The phone is on the floor ringing out in an empty house
Dovidl’s family has moved out

INTERCUT WITH
Martin hanging up the phone

DOVIDL’S VOICE
-What you did Mottl was return
to me my individuality You thrust
it back into my hands like an
unwanted gift I consider all debts
paid today You have made me free
and for that I thank you But from
the depths of my soul I must ask
you not to find me again You must
think of me now as dead and act
accordingly

102 INT SIMMONDS HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT (A’86) 102

Martin is re-reading Dovidl’s letter probably for the tenth
time Helen is looking out of the window

DOVIDL’S VOICE (VO)
--May the Holy One bless you and
keep you and your family always in
His sight Your affectionate
brother Dovidl

HELEN
Let him go Martin

MARTIN
How am I supposed to think of him
as dead when I know he isn’t

HELEN
Trust the text He’s given you
permission Probably the only
selfless thing he’s ever done

Martin shaking his head Refusing to accept it

HELEN
That prayer Jews say for the dead

MARTIN
Kaddish

HELEN
Say that
Blue - SoN D91 p-95A

MARTIN
I can’t I’m not Jewish I’m not
his brother and he isn’t dead

Blue - SoN D91 p96

A long silence follows Helen has only one card left to play

HELEN
That day he didn’t show up

He turns to look at her She remains staring out of the
window

HELEN (CONTD)
When you left him after the
rehearsal Nobody knew where he
went

Martin makes no response but recalls it clearly

HELEN
I’m where he went

MARTINS REACTION

There isn’t one at least nothing discernible He never knew
of a romantic liaison between Helen and Dovidl but neither
has he told Helen that he slept with Anna in Poland This
revelation balances the scales It assuages both his guilt
and hers and it’s enough to dispel the myth of Dovidl

Helen reaches out and takes his hand
HELEN
You’re a better man than he was
Martin You always were
INT SIMMONDS HOUSE NIGHT (A’86) 103
Hours later Helen is sleeping as Martin climbs out of bed
MARTIN (VO)
Yitgadal v’yitqadash sh’mai

rabah

WIDENING TO

INT SIMMONDS HOUSE MARTIN’S HOME OFFICE NIGHT (A’86) 104
CAMERA FINDS THE CASED GAGLIANO
--PANS TO MARTIN

Wearing a dressing gown over his pyjamas he has come here
from his bed in the small hours From a copy of Brewer’s
Dictionary of Phrase and Fable he extracts a postcard-sized
card printed with transliterated characters of the mourner’s
Kaddish - the kind Reform synagogues issue to congregation
members who have no Hebrew
Blue - SON D91 p-97

From it he reads aloud the ancient Aramaic prayer His
reading marked by mispronunciations and mistaken cadences
is coloured by a spectrum of emotions love anger above all
overwhelming sadness his voice breaks as he assigns Dovidl
his desired place among the dead laying him finally to rest

THOUGH WE WON’T HEAR ALL OF IT THE FULL PRAYER READS

MARTIN

SLOW FADE TO BLACK

MARTIN
Magnified and sanctified be God’s
great name throughout the world
that God created and governs by
divine will May the Kingdom of
God be established during your
lifetime and during your days
and during the days of all the
house of Israel yea speedily and
in the near future and let us
say Amen

Exalted glorified and honored be
the name of the blessed Holy One
whose glory is beyond all
blessings hymns and praises that
people render and let us say
Amen

May great peace emanate from
Heaven with good life for us and
for all Israel and let us say
Amen

May the One who makes peace in the
heavens make peace for us and for
all Israel and let us say Amen

On the sound track initially overlapping Martin’s prayer
then gradually displacing it we’ll hear the fully
orchestrated version of The Song of Names which will

continue to play until
