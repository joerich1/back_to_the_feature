moment and then with the lights
coming up they move towards the front
Calls of Taxi can be heard There
is a smudge-pot fire in front of the
tenement

THREE STREET ENTERTAINERS (BUSKERS)
are performing for the richly
gowned and tailored crowd

MRS- EYNSFORD-HILL and FREDDY are seen
emerging from the crowd at UL and cross
to DRC SHE is indicating to him in
the hub-bub to dash along and find a
taxi HE is calling for one Suddenly
one of the BUSKERS does a cartwheel and
crashes into him A cry of Aaaaaaocooow

HIGGINS
A woman who utters such depressing ‘and disgusting noises
has no right to be anywhere - no right to live Remember
that you are a human being with a soul and the divine gift
of articulate speech that your native language is the
language of Shakespeare and Milton and the Bible and
dont sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon

French gentleman Well you wouldnt have the face to
ask me the same for teaching me my own language as you
would for French so I wont give more than a shilling
Take itor leave it

HIGGINS
(Xes behind sofa to L of PICKERING)
You know Pickering if ‘you consider a shilling not as a
simple shilling but as a percentage of this girls income
it works out as fully equivalent to sixty or seventy pounds
from a millionaire By George its the biggest offer I
ever had

ELIZA
(Rises in great amazement)
Sixty pounds What are you talkin about I never
offered you sixty pounds Where would I get

HIGGINS
Oh hold your tongue

Pickering I never had the slightest intention of walking
over anybody All I propose is that we should be kind to

because I did not wish to hurt her delicacy or yours

it out of me mouth

HIGGINS
(Leading HER up the stairs)
Think of it Eliza Think of chocolates and taxis
and gold and diamonds

ELIZA
(At top of balcony MRS PEARCE X to
front of wing chair)
No I dont want no gold and no diamonds Ima
good girl I am

PICKERING
Excuse me Higgins But I really must interfere Mrs
Pearce is quite right If this girl is to put herself ft

in your hands for six months for an experiment in y
teaching she must understand thoroughly what shes doing
HIGGINS

(HE walks a few steps in thought

and turns to HER suddenly)
Eliza you are to stay here for the next six months learning
how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florists shop
If youre good and do whatever youre told you shall sleep
in a proper bedroom and have lots to eat and money to buy
chocolates and take rides in taxis If youre naughty and
idle you will sleep in the back kitchen among the black
beetles and be walloped by Mrs Pearce with a broomstick
At the end of six months you shall go to Buckingham Palace
in a carriage beautifully dressed If the King finds out
youre not a lady you will be taken by the Police to the
Tower of London where your head will be cut off as a warning
to other presumptuous flower girls If you are not found out
you shall have a present of seven-and-six to start life with as
a lady in a shop If you refuse this offer you will be the most
ungrateful wicked girl and the angels will weep for you

(To PICKERING)
Now are you satisfied Pickering

(PICKERING turns upstage with a

hopeless shrug

To MRS PEARCE)
Could I put it more plainly or fairly Mrs Pearce
MRS PEARCE
(Xing U stairs to upper balcony)
Come with me Eliza

HIGGINS
(Opening door)
Thank you Mrs Pearce Bundle her off to the bathroom

ELIZA
Youre a great bully you are I wont stay here if I
dont like And I wont let nobody wallop me

ELIZA

(As SHE goes
If Id known what I was lettin’ myself in for I wouldnt
have come up here Ive always been a good girl and I
wont be put upon

(And SHE is gone with MRS PEARCE

PICKERING X to R of wing chair)

HIGGINS
(HIGGINS immediately closes the door
and turns to PICKERING enthusiastically
Xing’ D stairs)
In six months - in three if she has a good ear and a
quick tdngue - Ill take her anywhere and pass her off
as anything Ill make a Queen of that barbarous wretch
(HIGGINS has Xed into the library picks up
some more charts and studies them intently)

PICKERING
Higgins forgive the bluntness but if Im to be in this
business I shall feel responsible for the girl I hope
its clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken
‘of her position

HIGGINS
(Not even looking up)
What That thing Sacred I assure you

PICKERING
Now come Higgins you know what I mean This is no
trifling matter Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned

HIGGINS
(Still not looking up)

are concerned

1-328

1-3-29
PICKERING
(X behind wing chair)
Yes Very frequently

HIGGINS

(X D to desk puts papers down)
Well I havent I find that the moment I let a woman make
friends with me she becomes jealous exacting suspicious
and a damned nuisance I find that the moment I let myself
become friends with a woman I become selfish and tyrannical

(Having put all papers down HE takes his

glasses off and put them in his pocket)
So here I am a confirmed 01d bachelor and likely to
remain so After all Pickering

Have you no morals man

DOOLITTLE é
No ZI cant afford em Governor Neither could you if you
was as poor as me Not that I mean any harm mind yabut
(Cleans off the wing chair with
HIS dirty hat and sits)
if Bliza is going to get a bit out of this why not me too
(HE is cleaning his teeth with HIS
tounge making a squeaking sound)
Eh Look at it my way What am I I ask ya what am I Im
one of the undeserving poor thats what I am Think what that
means to a man
(HE is now scratching under HIS shirt with
greatdelight at the pleasure of it)
It means hes up agenst middle-class morality for all the time
If theres anything going and I put in for a bit of it its
always the same story Youre undeserving so you cant have it
(HE-has been scratching through all this with
HIGGINS and PICKERING watching in fascination
HIS hand now reaches HIS buttock)
But my needs is as great as the most deserving widows that ever
got money out of six different charities in one week for the
death of the same husband
(HE sits ‘back and roars with laughter
HIGGINS Xes to L of DOOLITTLE)
I dont need less that a deserving man I need more I dont
eat less hearty than he does and I drink a lot more Im
playing straight with you I aint pretending to be deserving
Im undeserving and I mean to go on being undeserving I like
it and thats the truth But will you take advantage of a
mans nature to do him out of the price of his own daughter
- what hes brought up fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow
till shes growed big enough to be interesting to you two
gentlemen Is five pounds unreasonable I put it to you and
I leave it to you

HIGGINS (After a pause)
You know Pickering if we were to take this man in hand for
six months he could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and
a popular pulpit in Wales I suppose we ought to give hima
fiver

PICKERING
Hell make bad use of it Im afraid

DOOLITTLE
Not me so help me Governor I wont Just one good spree for
myself and the missus givin pleasure to ourselves and employ-
ment to others and satisfaction to you to know it aint been
throwed away You couldnt spend it better

1-5-39
HIGGINS

This is irresistible

(HE scratches a flea under HIS shirt)
Oh damn

(HE Xes to desk)
Lets give him ten

DOOLITTLE

No The missus wouldnt have the heart to spend ten
Governor ten pounds is a lot of money it makes a man feel
prudent-like and then goodbye to happiness No you give
me what I ask for Governor not a penny less not a penny
more

(HIGGINS Xes to desk opens top drawer

leoks for money in HIS wallet)

PICKERING
I rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of
immortality Doolittle why dont you marry that
missus of yours After all marriage is not so
frightening You married Elizas mother

DOOLITTLE
Who told you that Governor

PICKERING
Well nobody told me But I concluded naturally ‘
(DOOLITTLE shakes HIS head no PICKERING
echoes the gesture and nodS oh HIGGINS
by now has found the money and Xes back to L
of the wing chair)

HIGGINS
Pickering if we listen to this man another minute we shall
have no convictions left Five pounds I think you said
(HE offers DOOLITTLE the money)

rises and Xes U to UC door)

Does the same thing hold true in India Pickering The
peculiar habit of not only dropping a letter like the
letter aitch but using it where it shouldnt be Like
hever™ instead of ever Youll notice some of the
Slavic peoples when they learn to speak English have a
tendency to that with their Gs They say linger
(soft g) instead of linger (hard g) and then they
turn around and say singer (hard g) instead of
singer (soft g)

hardly ever happen

FREDDY (Laughing)

ELIZA

FREDDY

susceptible to it

ELIZA

My aunt died of influenza so they said

(MRS EYNSFORD-HILL clicks HER tongue
sympathetically)

But its my belief they done the old woman in
(HIGGINS and PICKERING havea
soundless argument accusing each
other of having taught ELIZA this
last unrehearsed phrase)

MRS HIGGINS
(Puzzled)
Done her in

ELIZA
Yes Lord love you Why should she die of influenza when
she come through diphtheria right enough the year before
Fairly blue with it she was They all thought she was dead
but my father he kept ladling gin down her throat

else to do balances HIS tea

You surely dont believe your aunt was killed
(HIGGINS and PICKERING expect the worst)

ELIZA
Do I not Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin let alone a hat

MRS EYNSFORDHILL
But it cant have been right for your father to pour spirits
down her throat like that It might have killed her

ELIZA

(HIGGINS stiffens PICKERING is tense
HIGGINS bows and lifts HIS hat to MRS
EYNSFORD-HILL in a gesture of farewell

Hes gone over to the Home Office sir

HIGGINS

You see that Mrs Pearce Im disturbed and he runs to
help Now theres a good fellow Mrs Pearce youre a
woman

(At UC singing
WHY CANT A WOMAN BE MORE LIKE A MAN
MEN ARE SO DECENT SUCH REGULAR CHAPS
READY TO HELP YOU THROUGH ANY MISHAPS
READY TO BUCK YOU UP WHENEVER YOU ARE GLUM
WHY CANT A WOMAN BE A CHUM

WHY IS THINKING SOMETHING WOMEN NEVER DO
WHY IS LOGIC NEVER EVEN TRIED
STRAIGHTNING UP THEIR HAIR IS ALL THEY EVER DO
WHY DONT THEY STRAIGHTEN UP THE MESS THATS INSIDE
‘(X D to MRS PEARCE hands HER
HIS coat and hat)

WHY CANT A WOMAN BE MORE LIKE A MAN
(SHE helps HIM into HIS coat
hands HIM HIS hat)
IF I WERE A WOMAN WHOD BEEN TO A BALL
BEEN HAILED AS A PRINCESS BY ONE AND BY ALL
WOULD I START WEEPING LIKE A BATHTUB OVERFLOWING
AND CARRY ON AS IF MY HOME WERE IN A TREE
WOULD I RUN OFF AND NEVER TELL ME WHERE IM GOING
WHY CANT A WOMAN BE LIKE ME

SCENE THE GARDEN OF MRS HIGGINS HOUSE
There is a tea table at C with
three chairs around it and set
for service for three

TIME Later that morning

AT RISE MRS HIGGINS and ELIZA are

having tea

MRS HIGGINS
And you mean to say that after you did this wonderful
thing for them without making a single mistake they just
sat there and never said a word to you Never petted you
or admired you or told you how splendid youd been

ELIZA
Not a word

MRS HIGGINS
Thats simply appalling I should not have thrown the
slippers at himI should have thrown the fire irons

HIGGINS
(Offstage)
Mother Mother

MRS HIGGINS
I thought it wouldnt be long
(ELIZA looks fearful and makes
a move to leave)

Stay where you are my dear

HIGGINS
(Offstage)
Mother where the devil are you

MRS HIGGINS
Remember last night you not only danced with a prince
but you behaved like a princess

HIGGINS
(Entering UL)
Mother the damndest
(Xes D to CS sees ELIZA)

ELIZA
How do you do Professor Higgins
(HE Xes D to L of the table)

HIGGINS

ELIZA
But of course you are You are never ill Would you care
for some tea

HIGGINS
Dont you dare try that game on me I taught it to you
Get up and come home and dont be a fool Youve caused
me enough trouble for one morning

MRS HIGGINS
very nicely put indeed Henry No woman could resist such
an invitation

HIGGINS
How did this baggage get here in the first place

MRS HIGGINS
Eliza came to see me and I was delighted to have her
And if you dont promise to behave yourself I shall have
to ask you to leave

HIGGINS
You mean Im to put on my Sunday manners for this thing
I created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent
Garden

MRS HIGGINS

Yes dear that is precisely what I mean

HIGGINS
(X UC)
Ill see her damned first
(HE Xes through the arches and paces
back and forth behind the flower boxes)

MRS HIGGINS
(To ELIZA)
How did you ever learn manners with my son around

ELIZA
It was very difficult I should never have known how
ladies and gentlemen behave if it hadnt been for Colonel
Pickering

(HIGGINS gives HER
HIS best cold stare)
i

2-5-31

ELIZA (Continued)
He always showed me that he felt and thought about me as
if I were something better than a common flower girl You
see Mrs Higgins apart from the things one can pick up
the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how
she behaves but how she is treated I shall always be a
flower girl to Professor Higgins because he always treats
me as a flower girl and always will But I know that I
shall always be a lady to Colonel Pickering because he
always treats me as a lady and always will

(There is a long grunt from HIGGINS)

MRS HIGGINS
Henry please dont grind your teeth

MAID
(Enters UR to URC) to
The Vicar is here matam Shall I show him into the garden

MRS HIGGINS
The Vicar and the Professor Good Heavens no Ill see
him in the library

(The MAID curtsies exits UR

MRS HIGGINS rises X to R of ELIZA)
Eliza if my son begins to break things I give you full
permission to have him evicted

(SHE Xes to UR turns to HIGGINS)
Henry dear if I were you I should stick to two subjects
the weather and your health

(SHE exits UR

HIGGINS Xes to L of the tea table

HE looks at ELIZA quizzically Slowly
HE pours HIS tea drops in a lump of
sugar then another and another and
still another)

HIGGINS
Well Eliza youve had a bit of your own back as you
call it Have you had enough And are you going to be
reasonable Or do you want any more

ELIZA
(Places cup down rises X DR)
You want me back only to pick up your slippers and put
up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you

HIGGINS
I havent said I wanted you back at all

2-5-32

ELIZA
(Turns to HIM)
Oh indeed Then what are we talking about

HIGGINS
About you not about me If you come back I shall treat
you just as I have always treated you I cant change my
nature and I dont intend to change my manners My
manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickerings

ELIZA
Thats not true He treats a flower girl as if she was
a duchess

HIGGINS
- And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl

ELIZA
Oh I see The same to everybody

HIGGINS

(Sits)
Just so The great secret Bliza is not having bad
manners or good manners or any other particular sort of
manners but having the same manner for all human souls
The question is not whether I treat you rudely but
whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better

(Lifts HIS cup of tea and stirs it)

ELIZA

(X to above table)
I dont care how you treat me I dont mind your swearing
at me I shouldnt mind a black eye Ive had one before
this But I wont be passed over

HIGGINS
Then get out of my way for I wont stop for you You
talk about me as if I were a motor bus
(Drinks tea)

ELIZA
(X behind table to L of HIM)
So you are a motor bus all bounce and go and no
consideration for anyone But I can get along without
you Dont think I cant

HIGGINS
I know you can I told you you could You never
wondered I suppose whether I could get along without
you

ELIZA
(X to above L pouffe)
Dont you try to get around me Youll have to

2-5-33

HIGGINS
And so I can Without you or any soul on earth But I
shall miss you Eliza Ive learned something from your
idiotic notions I confess that humbly and gratefully

ELIZA
Well you have my voice on your gramaphone When you feel
lonely without me you can turn it on Its got no feelings
to hurt

HIGGINS
I cant turn your soul on

ELIZA
(X around pouffe to L of HIGGINS)
Oh you are a devil You can twist the heart in a girl as
easily as some can twist her arms to hurt her What am I
to come back for

HIGGINS
(Rises puts cup down X to R of HER)
For the fun of it Thats why I took you on-

ELIZA
And you may throw me out tomorrow if I dont do everything
you want me to

HIGGINS

Yes and you may walk out tomorrow if I dont do everything

you want me to

ELIZA
And live with my father

HIGGINS

ELIZA (Continued)
Ive always had chaps enough wanting me that way Freddy Hill
writes to me twice and three times a day sheets and sheets

HIGGINS
(X D to L of HER)
Oh in short you want me to be as infatuated about you as
he is is that it

ELIZA
Face to face with HIM at CS)

No I dont Thats not the sort of feeling I want from
you I want a little kindness I know Im a common
ignorant girl and you a book-learned gentleman but Im
not dirt under your feet What I done -
(Correcting herself)
What I did was not for the dresses and the taxis I did
it because we were pleasant together and I come - came to
care for you not to want you to make love to me and not
forgetting the difference between us but more friendly like

HIGGINS
Yes of course That’s just how I feel
(X DL)
And how Pickering feels Eliza youre a fool

ELIZA
(Sits at chair R of tea table)
Thats not a proper answer to give me

HIGGINS

(Turns to hER)
Its the only answer youll get until you stop being a
plain idiot

(X to L of table)
If youre going to be a lady youll have to stop feeling
neglected if the men you know dont spend half their time
snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes

(HE Xes to above table)
You find me cold unfeeling selfish dont you Very
well Be off with you to the sort of people you like
Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money
and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick
pair of boots to kick you with

(X DR)
If you can’t appreciate what youve got youd better
get what you can appreciate

ELIZA (Rises)
Oh I cant talk to you you turn everything against me
Im always in the wrong But dont you be too sure that
you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked
down
