CHARACTER LIST

RAMON MIGUEL VARGAS
(Known to Susan as MIKE)

SUSAN

HANK QUINLAN

Ow

A special investigator attached to the
Minister of Justice in the Mexican Govern
ment -- in other words a federal official
rather than a policeman Mike whose father
was in the diplomatic service was educated
in Switzerland and England He is an ideal
ist but not at all of the imprattical
starry-eyed variety His life is dedicated
to the preservation of deniocratic institu
tions He believes in the law he is con-
cerned with law enforcement but his dislike

of the abuses of police power is every bit

as intense as his opposition to crime itself

Six weeks ago at a diplomatic party Mike
met a young American tourist --

They fell in love quickly and without any
warning to their parents were married

Susie is extremely attractive and quick and
bright Her alert and almost world-wise

air in no way reduces an essential freshness
and innocencein her personality a peculiar-
ly American combination this mingling of
cleverness and simplicity -- it still some
times bewilders her Latin husband

To the extent that a policemans achievement
is measured by the number of convictions he
is responsible for Quinlan is something
close to a great man But he is also a-
bully and a bigot He regards himself not
ands a servant of the public but as an almost
divinely inspired instrument of justice He
is the perfect opposite of everything Mike
stands for and his personal dedication is
quite as complete as Mikets own Before his
story is aver he has become not only a crimi-
nal but a murderer but this is not because
of any compromise or defection from his own
perverted principles -- it develops logically
from the extension of those principles

CHARACTER LIST -

PETE MENZIES

The police sérgeant who has been Quinlans
partner for many years Pete has become

in many ways a reflectionof Quinlan con-
sciously striving to imitate his thoughts
and equal his deeds Pete is the third
idealist in our story but his idealism

has been channeled into the worship of his
chief There is nothing Pete would rather
be than a detective and in his eyes there
is no detective on earth more admirable than

Hank Quinlan But Pete has something vital

“UNCLE JOB GRANDI

PANCHO

RISTO

which Quinlan lacks he has a personal con-
science and when he is ultimately forced to
face up to the ugly reality that Quinlan is
not ademigod at all but a grave menace
to society Pete finds the guts and dignity
to stand on his own two feet and to defy
the man he has so long adored

is the acting head of a large clan of gang-
sters who have been ruling the underworld

of Los Robles on both sides of the border
for two generations But his leadership is
recent Mike has just put the real boss
(Vic) behind bars and Uncle Joe assumes
the direction of the family affairs with
great uneasiness -- even something like hys-
teria He is not built to be a commanding
general (even in this provincial gang-land)
-- up until now he had found his niche as
manager of Grandits Rancho Grandi” and
other more private clubs Pornography and
blackmail have been his extremely profitable
Sidelines He is vain a cowardly little man
with a dirty and ingenious mind Under his
temporary leadership are a group of nephews
and cousins including

This Le what Susan calls him -- we never
learn his real namé He is the glamor boy
of the young gang

ary course of things a regular member of the

THE BORDER - THE MEXICAN SIDE

BG Susan can be seen coming through the border check In the
Puke 4 young handsome MEXICAN TYPE tall and extremely good-
looking in a rather sinister way stands watching her After
she passes him he throws away his cigarette and starts after
her CAMERA FOLLOWING

CAMERA MOVING AHEAD of the young Mexican catches up with Susan
and holds her fg as she continues up the street on her way to
the hotel

The handsome Mexican is close at her heels and now as she stops
to let some traffic pass he comes up next to her showing his”

white teeth in a dazzling grin She gives him an unmistakingly
cold shoulder and starts briskly across the street where she is
very nearly run down by a speeding truck

FRESH ANGLE TO COVER ACTION

The handsome youth saves her yanking her back to safety and
then laughs into her face A few idlers gather to view this
scene The Mexican says something and Susan tries to pull away
but he persists holding her arm There has been a good bit of
giggling from the onlookers and now one of them steps forward

something very important for
Mr Vargas 7
She looks up from the note The Mexican nods From the greasy
duck-tailed hairdo to the sharp-pointed shoes its very obvious
just what type of young character this is Caution however is
not a virtue of Susans and curiosity is her guiding vice

SUSAN
Well --

visible shrug)

The Mexican starts to speak

SUSAN

INT HOTEL SUSAN AND MIKES BEDROOM

Flashing neon-sign effects and hectic offstage mixture of dance
music

A narrow street -- no more than an alley -- séparates the bedroor
window from the window of another building A MAN stands at this
opposite window He holds an electric torch and plays it into
Susans bedroom -- following her as she moves arms full of
clothes from the closet to her bed She is packing -- trying

hard not to pay any attention to the teasing flashlight But

her temper gets the better of her she switches on the light

-and then marches to the window

SUSAN
(calling furiously
across)
See any better this way

She no glares at the window opposite The room where The Man stands
is also dark and from Susans viewpoint the man is just a figure
holding a flashlight She suspects who it is Pancho but she
cant be sure

SUSAN
Hey buster You can turn lt off

Youtre wasting your batteries

The flashlight switches offbut The Figure opposite remains
motionless - obviously trying tostare her down Abruptly she
turns back into the room seizes the hanging light bulb unscrews
it and then suddenly whirls - pitching it expertly across the
alley at the other window There is a gratifying noise as the
bulb bursts in the darkened room opposite but this is inmediatel
spoiled for Susan by a low derisive laugh Panchots laughs

A slight pause then
