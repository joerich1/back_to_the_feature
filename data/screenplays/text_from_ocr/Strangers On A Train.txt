Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers
with luggage busy redcaps etcetera

We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping The driver hands
out modest looking luggage including a bunch of tennis
rackets in cases to a redcap CAMERA PANS DOWN as the
passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes
and the lower part of his trousers He is wearing dark
colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently The

feet move toward the entrance to the station and out of
scene Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up
and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of
this and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to
be wearing black and white sport shoes which as before are
all we see of him The sport shoes start off in the wake of
the brogues

INT STATION LOBBY

CAMERA FOLLOWS the sport shoes and the brogues across the
lobby into a passenger tunnel There is the usual activity
of passengers walking to and from a loud-speaker announcing
trains etc

The legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out and one
of the shoes touches one of the brogues

MANS VOICE (over scene)
Oh excuse Me

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two
parlor car chairs BRUNO ANTHONY the wearer of the sport
shoes is about twenty-five He wears his expensive clothes
with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always
had the best The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking
but at the moment a somewhat troubled young man This is
GUY HAINES He too is in his middle twenties and is well
dressed because he can now afford to be He nods politely
acknowledging Brunos apology then turns away with the
gesture implying he wants privacy

BRUNO
(smiling with sudden
recognition)
I beg your pardon but arent you
Guy Haines

Guy nods with a polite half smile Being a well known
tournament tennis player he has had this sort of experience

before

BRUNO
(snapping his finger)
Sure I saw you blast Faraday right
off the court in South Orange last
season What a backhand Made the
semi-finals didnt you

Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his
magazine rolled up in is fist

BRUNO
(with open admiration)

things
(smiling and
introducing himself)

the faintest expression of disdain

grin)
I dont usually talk so much Go
Ahead and read

GUY
(wryly)
Thanks
Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Brunos open
appraisal

BRUNO
It must be pretty exciting to be so
important

GUY

(fidgeting slightly)
A tennis player isnt so important
BRUNO
People who do things are important
I never seem to do anything

Not knowing how to answer this Guy looks a little
embarrassed

BRUNO
(still insistent on
being friendly)
I suppose youre going to Southampton --
for the doubles

GUY
(politely)
You are a tennis fan

Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute

BRUNO
Wish I could see you play But Ive

gives to the waiter waving away the change He offers a
glass to Guy Guy takes it

INT BRUNOS COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS)

Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch Bruno has been drinking
and his eyes are bright and feverish An almost empty liquor
bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with
gaudily Illustrated dust jackets Bruno has in unlighted
cigarette in his mouth Guys lighter is on the table
Bruno snaps it a couple of times as though fascinated lights
his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again

BRUNO

Sure I went to college Three of
them Every time they kicked me out
my father threw me back in

(bitterly)
He finally gave up He thinks Im
awfully small fry not worth the
bait

(wistfully)
You my friend Guy

GUY
Sure Im your friend Bruno

BRUNO
(a little woozy)
No youre not nobody thinks Im
anything special Only my mother
(empties the bottle
into his glass)
My father hates me

Guy smiles this off as nonsense

GUY
You must be imagining things

BRUNO

(hitting the bottom

of the bottle for

the last drop)
And I hate him He thinks I ought
to catch the eight-five bus every
morning punch a timeclock and work
my way up selling paint or something
Him -- with all his money

GUY
(amused by Bruno)
Well what do you want to do

BRUNO
You mean before or after I kill him

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 9
GUY
(chuckling)
Before of course

BRUNO

(leaning forward

eagerly)
I want to do everything I got a
theory youre supposed to do
everything before you die Have you
ever driven a car blindfolded at a
hundred and fifty miles an hour

GUY
Not lately
BRUNO
I did I flew in a jet plans too
(his hand traces a
swift streak through
the air and he adds
sound effects)
Zzzzzzzp Man thats a thrill
Almost blow the sawdust out of my
head Im going to make a reservation
on the first rocket to the moon

GUY
(amused and curious)
What are you trying prove

BRUNO
Im not like you Guy Youre lucky
Youre smart Marrying the bosss
daughter is a nice short cut toa
career isnt it

GUY
(quickly)
Marrying the senators daughter has
nothing to do with it Cant a fellow

Well be pulling in soon Ive got

BRUNO

GUY

BRUNO

Thats it Miriam Joyce Haines

Played around a lot I suppose
GUY

Lets not talk about it any more

BRUNO
(almost hopefully)
Maybe shell make more trouble for
you

GUY
I dont think so

BRUNO
You mean you got enough on her to
get your divorce no matter what

GUY
Lets change subject Bruno cant
we

BRUNO

Okay Guy Want me to tell you one
of my ideas for murdering my father

GUY
(indicating the
detective novels)
Youve been reading too many of these

BRUNO
(going right on)
You want to hear about the busted
light socket in the bathroom or the
carbon monoxide in the garage
GUY
No I may be old fashioned but I
thought murder was against the law

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

BRUNO
But not against the law of nature
My theory is that everybody is a
potential murderer Didnt you ever
want to kill somebody Say one of
those useless fellows Miriam was
running around with

GUY
You cant go around killing people
just because you think theyre
useless

BRUNO
Oh whats a life or two Some people
are bitter off dead Guy Take your --
wife and my father for instance
It reminds me of a wonderful idea
had once I used to put myself to
sleep at night -- figuring it out
Now lets say you want to get rid
of your wife

GUY
Why

BRUNO

Lets say she refuses to give you a
divorce --

(raises a finger and

stops Guys protest)
Lets say Youd be afraid to kill
her because youd get caught And
what would trip you up Motive
Now heres the plan

GUY
Im afraid I havent time to listen

BRUNO
(ignoring the remark)
Its so simple too A couple of
fellows meet accidentally like you

He holds out his hand

and me No connection between them
at all Never saw each other before
Each of them has somebody hed like
to get rid of but he cant murder
the person he wants to get rid of
Hell get caught So they swap
murders

GUY
Swap murders

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

BRUNO

Each fellow does the other fellows

murder Then there is nothing to
connect them The one who had the
motive isnt there Each fellow
murders a total stranger Like you
do my murder and I do yours

GUY
(with relief)
Were coming into my station

BRUNO
For example your wife my father
Criss-cross
GUY
(sharply)
What

BRUNO
(with a smile)

We do talk the same language -- dont

we Guy

GUY
(preparing to leave)
Sure we talk the same language
Thanks for the lunch

BRUNO
(beaming)
Im glad you enjoyed it I thought

the lamb chops were a little overdone

myself

Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands
GUY
Nice meeting you Bruno

BRUNO
(detaining him at the
door)
You think my theory is okay Guy
You like it

GUY

goodbye and hurries
away)

of a couple of customers and salespeople inside Guy comes
along the street and goes into the shop

INT MUSIC SHOP

As Guy enters There are the usual counters and shelves
pianos and radios on display and the sound of a piano being
tuned in the back of the store MIRIAM is finishing with a
customer at a counter MR HARGREAVES the manager is busy

at the shelves Another girl clerk is serving a customer

In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out a
customer is playing symphonic music in a second glass cubicle

her woman customer handing over a small package

MIRIAM
(taking money from
customer)
Even change Thank you Madam
(she looks up at Guy
as the woman moves
off)
Well -- hello Guy

GUY
Youre looking well Miriam

Miriams face is pretty because it is still young She is
self-centered and inclined to be vindictive She wears

harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her
eyes look small

playing tennis with all your rich
friends

(sly little smile)
Whats your hurry

GUY
My hurry Thats funny coming from
you Youre the one whos in a hurry

MIRIAM
(coyly)
When you wouldnt give me the divorce
right away I sort of hoped it was
because you were a little bit jealous

GUY
(biting)
I got over being jealous a long
time ago Miriam
Miriams eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved
closer within listening range

MIRIAM
(indicating empty
glass cubicle)
Lets talk in there

Guy follows Miriam across to the empty room Miriam has
brought her purse along

They enter

INT CUBICLE

Once inside the sounds of the music playing from other parts
of the shop are heard but very faintly The piano tuning
still goes on but less stridently Miriam and Guy are cooped
together in the close quarters

MIRIAM
(intimately)
Now this is cosier Sort of like
old times isnt it Guy

knocks the tone

arm
across the record with a loud screech From outside we can
see heads turn Mr Hargreaves the manager is very
disturbed

MED SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES VIEWPOINT
We see Guy gripping Miriams arms and apparently addressing
her in a threatening manner although we do not hear his
words The smile has faded from Miriams face and something
like cringing fear has taken its place She is drawn and
tense and seems to cower beneath Guys rage

Mr Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guys tirade

GUY
Thats what should happen to people
like you And if I

HARGREAVES
(interrupts)
Break it up folks This isnt the
place for a family quarrel

screams at him

fishwife)

turning around in surprise

their doors simultaneously and Miriams tirade is climaxed
by a cacophony of noise a big symphony loud hot music and
the apparently unaware piano tuner

looks through his pockets for his lighter doesnt find it

with unpleasant

realization)

calmly)

But you sound so savage

him at a little table in the Anthony living room She is
working with scissors file and nail buffer Mrs Anthony

is a gentle once pretty woman whose pastel exterior harbors
a tigress-like determination to protect her son Bruno is in
his robe and is unshaven

dark appointments of this room
