AS THE OPENING CREDITS ROLL

INT HOUSE VENICE CANALS CALIFORNIA PRESENT

EMME early to mid thirties sits on the floor of her
living room There is no furniture except for a couch
the large sliding glass doors are open to a backyard that
overlooks the canals

While Emme ties knots on the stems of daisies she stares
at the curtains that occasionally blow open and from her
POV we see the canals Emme closes her eyes as the water
in the canals laps against the sides It’s calming lull
takes on a whispery rhythm but what Emme hears is

CANALS
The Daniels are dead The Daniels are dead

This choir falls away as we roam the canals The houses
are relatively close together but vary in size and
demeanor Some are McMansions and take up two lots others
are modest cottages still others are modern and sleek
while others have the look and feel of a New England
Clapboard house

The canals intertwine and wind around the houses no cars
tread here people walk or ride their bikes White bridges
are scattered throughout and they connect the various
walkways Most houses have a dock in front of them and a
canoe kayak or some sort of water transportations tied to
it

EXT VENICE CANALS AFTER MIDNIGHT PRESENT

A full moon shines over the canals which are peppered
with colorful canoes the air is filled with night
blooming jasmine Emme in her husband’s old shirt ripped
jeans and her sorrow night strolls From a house on the
canals ROSE Emme’s ten year old niece watches her Aunt
from her bedroom window Her knowing eyes clues us into
the fact that she’s wise beyond her years

INT EMME’S HOUSE BEDROOM NEXT MORNING

A bed a mirror one night table Emme who clearly hasn’t
slept stares up at the ceiling She sighs rolls over
stares at the wall then gets up walks into her master
bath stares at herself in the mirror utterly disappointed
she’s still here steps into the shower blasts the cold
water Not even freezing cold pellets can penetrate her
grief She finally picks up the soap
INT EMME’S KITCHEN TEN MINUTES LATER

Emme clean in some ways dirty in others aimlessly looks
for food Her answering machine light flickers she hits
the button opens a cabinet filled with the same brand of
peanut butter She contemplates a choice

ANSWERING MACHINEMORGAN
Okay don’t pick up again But remember today is
therapy day and whether you like it or not
you’re going

Emme takes a jar from the center grabs a spoon sits on
the counter next to her set of carving knives She eyes
them longingly as she opens the jar

ANSWERING MACHINEMORGAN (CONTD)
Don’t argue with me or do Do something I’m
gonna check up on you And if you don’t show
youre You’re not allowed to see Rose ever
again I love you

Emme licks the spoon The answering machine clicks off

EMME
Bitch

Her voice is raspy strong and yet broken She grabs a
blue Sharpie from the counter writes Twenty-four months
Five days Twenty-five minutes and crosses out the
notation above it A parent’s way of counting the passing
days during the first year of their child’s life Or
death

Emme puts the spoon on the counter the jar back and
walks out the door

Now Emme purposely passes them She turns to the newbie

EMME

living-tragedy will be on Margaret’s 411
Everyone hates her but we let her stay because
she has no life and she brings the donuts What
no jelly today

Chirpy can’t react as the meeting is called to order by a
short dark haired woman with a sultry voice

STEPHANIE
Okay people today we’re going to do things
differently

The group exchanges worried glances Emme finds a seat in
the back close to the door

and no amount of talking is going to make it any
easier

Phil leans into his friend Nick as the room snickers

PHIL
Ernie has never consumed anything because of
choices A or B Did you have grilled cheese for
lunch

NICK
Yes why God you’re like a Doberman

Ernie continues speaking in the background

PHIL
The fact that Im trying to figure out how to
get mass quantities of women to consume a diet
cheesecake is wrong in a ‘yep hes a sexist
pig kind of way

ERNIE
Stanton youve a lot to say What do you think
of it

Phil spies Emme walking past she stops when she sees him
see her Nick looks to see what he’s looking at From his
POV there is no one there

PHIL
(snaps out of it) Is the client here What we
have is a cheesecake that tastes like sandpaper
and jelly And if Im going to be honest
sandpaper and jelly actually tastes better than
this shit

As they laugh he sees Emme then she fades away

PHIL (CONTD)
But this is our claim to fame We bilk the
unsuspecting public out of their hard earned
money by promising them better relationships and
fabulous children if they just buy what we’re
selling The product sucks Now if you don’t
mind I have to figure out how to get some
unsuspecting women to part with their self
esteem

Phil gathers his stuff and leaves

suck
PHIL

Oh it sucks It sucks out loud

Phil’s finger is bleeding he walks out into the kitchen
Nick follows him

NICK
If it’s not brilliant why are you still here

Phil runs his hand under the faucet

PHIL
Because instead of writing the book I blew the
deal took a high paying advertising job and
proposed to my girlfriend of five years After
which I buried myself knee-deep in the world of
soul sucking crap That’s why I’m still here

NICK
So you’ve got nothing

Phil nods yes then finds a first-aid kit and puts a
band-aid on it

PHIL
Have you noticed that theres a different smell
to the office at night Old coffee hangs in the
air and it’s joined by little snatches of salted
snacks half-eaten sandwiches (sniffs)
You’re an Aqua Velvet man Im not sure why I
can do this My nose isnt extra large Its
average in size Right

NICK
You seriously need some sleep

PHIL
No I need to night stroll

Nick reacts as Phil sniffs the air

PHIL (CONTD)
I’m not the only one who night strolls you

NICK
The copy writer who lost her family I just
passed her office Light was on Is she

working on this with you
PHIL
She lives in the canals like me I’ve never seen
her but she lives there
A moment of silence Nick checks his watch
NICK
I have to meet my wife And you have to go home
I’m sure Deandra is waiting for you Later

Phil says nothing as he leaves He sniffs the air again

PHIL
Cleaning supplies

The cleaning lady rounds the corner with her cart Phil
smiles

INT D H and B ADVERTISING HALLWAY SAME

Phil turns a corner Emme hears a noise and a door flies
open Nick zipping his fly walks out he’s with the
woman NORA from earlier

NICK
True But with Phil it’s odd

NORA
Not another one of your theories

NICK
Having sex in the print room wasn’t a theory it
was an idea

As Nora buttons she walks to the elevator Emme follows

NORA
I know but it stemmed from your moronic theory
of pregnancy

NICK
If the only way a man can knock up his wife is
by having sex on demand then they might as well
make it interesting

Emme stands at the elevator with them When it arrives
she hesitates then gets on with them

NORA
Interesting is good an audience is not which
is why Im not so thrilled about the whole
Griffith Observatory thing Youre taking this a
bit too far

NICK
Come on it’s better than saying mommy and daddy
had to have sex whenever mommy was ovulating and
then mommy had to stand on her head for a half
hour

NORA
(laughs) Okay what’s your Phil theory

NICK
Ah the Phil theory Have you noticed that he
only works late when she works late

NORA
Who is she

EMME
Who is she

Emme catches herself They don’t react they trade looks
He swings his jacket to cover the surveillance camera
Nora stops the elevator Suddenly flesh is being pressed

runs out

balls to let her dump me I’m not crazy

reaction) She never told you Wow That’s how
much I don’t matter to her

she is Emme Taylor Or if Emme Taylor exists
You know what your problem is You’ve got life
block You blew the book deal and now you’re
afraid of everything so you’re inventing
people

PHIL
And then I went to all the trouble of getting
someone to pretend they’re the person I
invented (Deflects the conversation) And youre
still in love with her

MIKE
(He deflects back) How do you know youre not
seeing things

PHIL
I told you about the whole tree thing her
sister Morgan was there and she didn’t see her
but her niece Rose did

MIKE
Yes but can anyone see this Rose you speak of
(off Phil’s look) I know you think what I do for
a living is a joke but aren’t you carrying this
a bit too far (off his reaction) Okay well
then maybe you need someone to talk too you
know a professional I can give you a few names

Phil starts to argue then gives up Mike picks from the
bowl of pretzels

MIKE (CONT’D)
She said she didnt love me at least not
enough Oh and she slept with another guy just
to make sure I got the point Maybe I need an
invisible woman

church Emme enters and stares at the altar From her POV
Emme is trapped under the passenger seat Her husband
struggles to get to their son he almost has him BAM

quickly grabs her

EMME
Still haven’t got the hang of that

Red smiles and keeps walking Emme follows and finally
notices the Invisibles as they fade into view They’re now
in front of a park Torches guard its perimeter

As the Invisibles cross over into the park the handicap
arent handicapped the homeless arent disheveled the
elderly are spry Emme notices the purple old ladies with
their goose and the man with the yellow umbrella

RED GALOSHES
This is my stop It can be your stop too

No cat I’m looking for a cat that looks like
a Harvey I just imagined that if I had a cat
Id call him Harvey

As they round the corner Phil sees a large white cat
Its the cat from the elevator The cat sits in his cage
like a king who has lost his court The Goth Chick opens
the cage coaxes him out and places him in Phil’s arm She
reads his tag

GOTH CHICK
Fate is with you dude His name is Harvey
That’s like spooky (she checks the tag) There’s
no information besides his name And hes been
here a week so he’s yours if you want him

She pulls it out and takes in her disheveled appearance

PHIL
I can see you right

EMME
(startled) Uh I think so

PHIL
How long have you been

EMME
There seems to be a time lapse between when
youre sorta invisible and when you chose to be
invisible At least that’s how she explained it
to me

PHIL
Explained to you By who

EMME
The lady in the red galoshes the guy in the bow
tie with the umbrella

PHIL
I knew I saw them That shouldn’t make me happy
should it Do you know why

EMME
Because they’re invisible

PHIL
No I mean why you’re invisible I’m not nuts
Right

EMME

I’m not such a good judge of that
Phil walks further into the office

PHIL
Do you have other powers

EMME
Powers (bemused) You said that with a straight
face

PHIL
You can watch people overhear things you’re not
supposed too Those are powers Say can you walk
through walls or turn into a human torch (off
her reaction) Did you try to fly (exasperated)
At least try walking through a wall

EMME
Are you nuts

Phil stares her down Emme tentatively puts out her hand
closes her eyes and reaches for the door She braces
herself Her hand hits the door Nothing

PHIL
(dejected) Hmmm that’s odd

EMME
That I’m invisible or that I can’t walk through
walls

PHIL

Both actually (looks at the desk) Come on Jump
up Maybe you can fly (off her reaction) What
do you have to lose

Emme stares at him

invisible Would we

over at the park I would be truly invisible
but then you said

RED GALOSHES
I dont know what to tell you its different
for everyone I pay my taxes I tip my waitress
I go to the gym No one sees me Being
invisible is a state of mind An escape An
island Its here because its where you
acknowledge you are

EMME
But if you do all those things how do people
not see you

The others exchange looks Purple loses this round

PURPLE OLD LADY
Because you stopped seeing yourself And when
you cant see yourself how do you expect to be
seen

Red Galoshes walks out of the park and fades away As Emme
tries to ask another question the sisters disappear Bow
Tie smiles at her

Old Lady Phil is scared Blonde and Purple take the lead
and suddenly the group is following them out of the canals
and down a quaint little block

EXTINT BLONDE AND PURPLE OLD LADIES HOUSE SAME

A very colorful house They follow the old ladies inside
The walls are crammed with memories of a forgotten time
The group studies the pictures taken with people who once
made up Hollywoods elite

BLONDE OLD LADY
That Cary Grant was a hell of guy

RED GALOSHES
He was gorgeous

PURPLE OLD LADY
He was everything you wanted him to be
charming handsome funny If my Colette
hadnt been his equal in every way I might have
taken him up on a few of his offers

Phil uncomfortable for many reasons keeps as far away from
everyone as possible

BOW TIE
You can’t catch it

RED GALOSHES
Especially when you already have it

They laugh Emme motions to Phil to sit he ignores her

BLONDE OLD LADY
Besides you’re not totally invisible

BOW TIE
Well that won’t be the case for long

Blonde Old Lady gets out a bottle of wine and begins
pouring Purple grabs the glasses and passes them around

PHIL
What does that mean How do you know

RED GALOSHES
Moments have a way of catching up to you and it
was in one of those moments that we decided if
we were going to be present in our lives or not
You chose not to be

PHIL
I never made that decision

PURPLE OLD LADY
We all made that decision We just werent aware
of it

Phil even more scared sucks down his wine

BOW TIE
When youve lived as long as I have you go from
being an invisible gay man to being allowed to
have a boyfriend then your boyfriend becomes
your husband and in my case when your husband
becomes your late husband youve reached the
point where you’re no longer pretty and age has
weathered your body So you either become a
beacon of light for those young men still
struggling to come out of course in order to do
this you must remain hip and youthful (sighs)
If not then you reach a time when the rest of
the gay community gently pushes you back in the
closet And this is my closet I am once again
an invisible gay man

Blond Old Lady pulls a checker board from one of her
drawers Something about it stops Emme From her POV the
top of a box matching the checker board a crisp fall
morning the final belongings of her husband and son
packed into a truck She stares at her house

PHIL
Do you remember the moment you got here

Blonde Old Lady sets up the checkerboard

RED GALOSHES
Knowing the moment won’t give you any answers

PHIL
Right (Excited) Weve got to figure out why
we’re here so we can go back

EMME
We haven’t gone anywhere Besides you’re not
invisible

PHIL

And I want it to stay that way
They hold a look Blonde has her checker board set up

BLONDE OLD LADY
Whose up for a game

EMME
Why not

RED GALOSHES
I’m not lending you any money

EMME
Money You play for money

BLONDE OLD LADY
Is there any other way

BOW TIE
Oh shit I know that look in her eye she’s gonna
take you to the cleaners

He just asked me a bunch of questions Adults
can be really stupid sometimes

Emme and Rose sit together in silence

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE SAME
Oliver and Morgan sit as the Doctor looks over his notes

DR THOMAS
It seems your daughter isn’t over the loss of
her uncle and young cousin And she’s manifested
herself a friend

MORGAN
Yes well it’s a phase kids go through

DR THOMAS
Yes but theres a difference Rose has a clear
definition between invisible and imaginary
According to Rose an imaginary friend is someone
you make up as a playmate And an invisible
friend is a person who is alive but no one sees
anymore

Oliver takes his wife’s hand

OLIVER
What does that mean

DR THOMAS
It means I think I should continue seeing your
daughter Maybe put her on an anti-depressant

MORGAN
(alarmed) She’s ten years old She’s not going
on drugs Do you know how many kids are over
medicated on Ritalin because of school quacks
who are appeasing teachers that want to maintain
calmer classrooms

DR THOMAS
I assure you that is not the case

OLIVER
Isn’t this a bit drastic

Emme fades into the room They don’t see her

DR THOMAS
Did you listen to your daughters definition of
invisible friend She thinks its someone who is
alive but that no one sees anymore Rose needs
continued counseling and it would perhaps be
best if she didnt see your sister for a while

MORGAN
What She’s the only one Emme really talks too

DR THOMAS
Isnt that a lot of stress for a child

EMME
Oh God what have I done to her

MORGAN
Hold it Slow down a minute Are her grades
falling Is she disrupting class

DR THOMAS
(looks at some papers) No
OLIVER
Is she being anti-social
DR THOMAS
No According to her teachers she’s very well
liked
MORGAN

So basically my daughter is a straight A
student with a full and active social life who
happens to occasionally speak to an invisible
friend And because of this you recommended that
she be put on anti-depressants Don’t you think
that’s a tad extreme

EMME
You tell him

Dr Thomas doesn’t reply

EMME

With that she bolts Phil chases after her Emme
carelessly throws open the door to the staircase and takes
them two at a time She reaches the door and crashes onto
the street She spies Phil on her heels and darts into
traffic A car a bus

PHIL (CONT’D)
Emme

Phil runs into the street as the sound of screeching
brakes the stench of burnt rubber and the pounding of
his heart overtakes him Ernie stands there From
everyone’s POV Phil ran into traffic There is no Emme

EXT STREETINT AMBULANCE LATER

Emme holds his hand as they lift him into the ambulance
There are cop cars news vans reporters and Ernie talking
to the cops

PHIL
Emme Emme

Phil sees her and it agitates him she gets out of the
ambulance and it calms him down

INT HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM SAME

Phil is on a stretcher Ernie hovers with a cop Emme
stands by Phil Everyone’s POV There is no Emme A
commanding looking man with tightly cropped grey hair
enters the room He walks over to Ernie

DR BARNES
Im Dr Barnes head of the Psychology unit You
a family member

Ernie watches as they shoot Phil up with something that
finally calms him down A young cop walks over

ERNIE
No I’m his boss They called his sister

DR BARNES
So he ran into oncoming traffic

COP 2
He said he was trying to save a woman who ran
into the traffic

(MORE)

COP 2(CONTD)
According to witnesses she didn’t exist and uh
according to his boss He was just fired

Dr Barnes looks at Ernie A CANDY STRIPER with pin
straight blue hair is revealed behind him she leaves the
room

DR BARNES
What has his frame of mind been lately

ERNIE
Well his fiancé dumped him he lost our
companys biggest account and I uh well I
just fired him

DR BARNES
Safe to say he was depressed

ERNIE
Uh yeah Is it okay if I leave

DR BARNES
(taken aback) Since you fired him I guess hes
no longer your responsibility

Ernie starts to leave The Candy Striper with the blue
hair comes back she’s got an orderly in tow

DR BARNES (CONTD)
But if he can prove his depression and suicidal
tendencies were due to an unhealthy work
environment Well let’s just say I wouldn’t
recommend taking him off his medical plan right
now

As Ernie digests that he leaves and bumps into The
orderly we get a closer look The orderly is the young
man we’ve seen before with the bowl haircut From The
Orderly’s POV He sees Emme holding Phils hand

DR BARNES (CONTD)
Hey you Bring him to the psych ward

The orderly walks over to Phil and starts pushing him
away Mike comes running in His POV No Emme

MIKE
Im Dr Temple Wheres my patient Phil
Stanton

DR BARNES

Dr Temple I’m Dr Barnes Your patient was
fired from his job moments before he ran into
oncoming traffic so he’s on his way to the psych
ward

MIKE
There’s no way He’s not suicidal

DR BARNES
Well maybe not he did however try to convince
the cops that he ran into traffic to save the
life of an invisible woman

Mike doesn’t flinch Emme however does Dr Barnes noticed
Mike’s non reaction

DR BARNES (CONTD)
You know about his invisible friend

MIKE
He’s been under a lot of stress

DR BARNES
Yes weve been told But if you knew about this
delusion you could have prevented what happened
today So which is it Did he try to kill
himself or is he seeing things And more
importantly why havent you done anything about
it There are a whole lot of drugs on the market
that can handle an early onset of
schizophrenia

MIKE
Medicating a patient isnt the only viable
solution

DR BARNES
Right I take it youre the holistic meditate
Feng Shui your patient to death type

Dr Barnes walks out

MIKE
Asshole

DR BARNES
I heard that

MIKE
I’m sure it wasn’t the first time

Dr Barnes glares at him Mike looks around helplessly
then walks out Emme fades from view

breakdown or a psychotic episode and need to be
on massive amounts of medication

PHIL
Because she’s here

OLIVER
But I cant see her And if I cant see her why

Emme puts her hand on Oliver’s shoulder He senses
something

PHIL
(softly) Because Rose can see her

OLIVER
Shes a ten-year-old child who still believes in
the tooth-fairy And what if shes suffering
from delusions

(MORE)

OLIVER (CONTD)
For all we know this is a delayed reaction to
the trauma she suffered when the Daniels died
and Emme took a header into depth defying grief
Why should I believe you Why should I hang the
hopes of my family on a figment of your
imagination

PHIL
I don’t know

Oliver angry kicks the other guest chair

OLIVER
You cant do any better than that You cant
give me a morsel of truth that will allow me to
think you’re right That Emme is floating out
there invisible to the world because its a
choice shes made Just tell us where she is
thats all we want to know

Phil looks to Emme

PHIL
Do something Make him believe

Oliver’s POV Phil is speaking to his feet Emme pulls him
into a hug At first he takes no notice but she sinks
into view Oliver feels her arms stares into her face

Morgan calmly sits Oliver rocks his daughter he kneels
down by his wife Emme hides her eyes

OLIVER
Sweetie I have to ask you something

question And it doesnt mean that you were
bad Did Mr Stanton Did Phil hurt you in any
way

Morgan grabs his arm and braces for the worst

ROSE

friend

OLIVER

Sometimes people hurt us and they have no idea

You can do this You have to do this

Emme stands in front of Morgan as she lifts the drink to

there The glass smashes to the ground The love that
radiates from Morgan’s eyes does Emme more harm than good
Emme disappears Morgan is shell shocked

GRACE
How long has this been going on (off his
reaction) Dont give me that He tells you
everything When did the whole pink elephant
thing start

MIKE
Pink elephant Drunks see pink elephants and
your brother isnt a drunk

GRACE
Id rather he be a drunk than in a hospital
gown handcuffed to the side of the bed and
pumped full of every drug under the sun because
he claims he was trying to save his imaginary
friend when she decided to play Russian Roulette
with oncoming traffic (pokes him) When did this
start and why didnt you call me

Mike hesitates Should he tell her

MIKE
It didnt seem like a big deal

PHIL
Uh guys I’m not handcuffed and I’m crazy not
deaf

Grace gives Phil then Mike the stink eye

GRACE
Not a big deal And you call yourself a doctor
Do you understand how lucky we are this is a
teaching hospital

(MORE)

GRACE (CONTD)
At least this place has a sliding scale for
crazy and right now hes at the bottom of the
scale but this couldve been Were lucky we
can visit him

MIKE
He came to me as a friend and as a friend I was
trying to help him the best way I could

Grace softens for a moment then fear creeps into her eyes

GRACE
Yeah well a hell of lot of good that did (to
Phil) I have to make a phone call

She exits The Orderly fades from view

MIKE
I should tell her

PHIL
You’1l lose your license Emme will get me out

heftiness that comes only to those who have lost people
they love looks to her friend

MORGAN
Any advice

KATIE
Hmm You have a daughter who thinks her Aunt has
turned invisible a man who tossed himself into
on-coming traffic to save said invisible Aunt
and a husband who now believes hes seen her in
the hospital room of the same man Words of
wisdom drink heavily

MORGAN
(wryly) Thanks

The silence beats down on them like the afternoon sun

KATIE
What if its true You said you saw her

MORGAN
I said I thought I saw her But I couldve
wished it on myself And she never came back
SO

KATIE
Seeing is believing But there are some things
you don’t see that you believe in

MORGAN
This is my first moment of peace I don’t want
to spend it debating the issue of invisibility
My sister is gone Shes either ran out of town
or met with some horrible fate Neither of which
I can handle right now

Suddenly The Orderly fades into view

ORDERLY
Hi there Can you tell me where I can find
Morgan Spadaro

MORGAN
Can I help you

ORDERLY
Im Nathaniel West Im a reporter for Weekend
News Im following up on a special interest
story about Phil Stanton the man who ran into
traffic to save your sister

Morgan and Katie bolt upright Emme stands as he enters
the yard

MORGAN
Excuse me

NATHANTEL
Well according to a good source it has been
confirmed that Phil was trying to save your
sister Emme Taylor

KATIE
Really and who is this good source

NATHANTEL
Im not at liberty to say You are looking for
your sister

He holds up a flyer Katie on her guard stands up

NATHANIEL (CONT’D)
Do you believe shes become invisible as Mr
Stanton said

Morgan pulls herself off the chair to her full height Her
five foot ten inch frame towers over her new friend

MORGAN
If I believed that would I hang flyers all over
Los Angeles

NATHANIEL
The police have stated that the blood found in
your sister’s house was her own There was no
sign of a struggle no body found and no
fingerprints other than family members in the
house Surely you have a comment

Morgan takes off her shoe and throws it at him Katie
grabs the hose and lets him have it The force of the
water pushes Nathaniel toward the edge of the canal before
he has a chance to steady himself he falls in with a
SPLAT

Morgan and Katie rush to the fence and watch as Nathaniel
flails about They make sure he’s okay He stands

MORGAN
That’s my comment

Katie and Morgan go into the house Emme watches him

NATHANIEL
Hey you Arent you going to help me up

Emme stares at him

NATHANIEL (CONTD)

Yeah you Come over here and help me out of this
polluted mess I am covered in duck shit and
dont want to end up with some strain of mad
duck disease

Emme looks around He can’t be speaking to her can he

NATHANIEL (CONTD)
Listen you can hide from them all you want I
dont give a shit but put that fucking thing
down and get over here

Emme walks towards him At the same time The Candy
Striper with the pin straight blue hair and hiding behind
a digital movie camera strolls in from the side hedges

CANDY STRIPER
I have a name try using it

NATHANIEL
You should try taking this seriously I’m
finally breaking into the national news And
youll have enough money to make that movie
youre always yammering about

CANDY STRIPER
I take is seriously If it wasn’t for me you
wouldn’t have this story

She helps him out He takes off his shoes Self conscious
of his club foot he hides it and stares at Emme The Candy
Striper’s POV no Emme

CANDY STRIPER (CONT’D)
What

NATHANIEL
Nothing I can prove yet

Emme fades from view

INT PHIL’S HOSPITAL ROOM SAME

The Invisibles are present Blonde Old Lady is playing
checkers with Bow Tie Purple and Red Galoshes play cards
Dr Barnes sits and studies Phil

DR BARNES
Tell me this again

PHIL
Imaginary friends are people who dont exist
that we pull from our imagination and create in
order to have someone we can always count on
Invisible people are people who actually exist
but turn invisible because theyre basically not
paying attention to their lives or they dont
want to be seen

Dr Barnes writes down a couple of things on his note pad
and then leans back in his chair

DR BARNES
And this state of invisibility is where you were
heading at the time you met this Emme person

PHIL
Yep I think I said that before And don’t say
it like that She’s a real person you know

Dr Barnes reacts stands up and strolls round the room
Blonde Old Lady jumps three of Bow Ties checkers then
begins mocking the doctors gait With every step he takes
shes right on his heels

PHIL (CONTD)
I could play the game you know I could tell you
everything you wanted to hear just to get out of
this place

DR BARNES
Then why don’t you

PHIL
Because if I do that I betray myself I betray
her I betray them

DR BARNES
The Invisibles But whats the point of it Why
arent they rescuing you Why is no one standing
up or showing themselves to get you out of
here

PHIL
When the time is right they will

DR BARNES
There’s no time like the present Mr Stanton

PHIL
Ah but according to Quantum Physics theres no
time space or motion

DR BARNES
That may be true but what is also true is that
youve been abandoned and left for crazy

PHIL
If I say I was wrong if I say I didnt believe
in them in her in anything that I can’t see
with my own two eyes and falls outside of the
realm of my five senses then Im worse off then
I am now

Dr Barnes runs his hands through his cropped hair

DR BARNES
How How is that possible

PHIL
Because it means I believe in nothing In one
full swoop I lose My faith My God My life
And what am I left with

DR BARNES
Reality

Dr Barnes goes to sit Purple moves the chair He doesn’t
fall but he’s confused

PHIL
Your reality

DR BARNES
Oh it’s not just mine

PHIL
I suppose it isnt But I cant live like that
I need to believe to trust to know that there
is something out there bigger than me bigger
than this universe

DR BARNES
What if youre wrong What if they never show
themselves What if you never get out of here
And it’s Jones town again only the psych ward
is the Kool-Aid

PHIL
I know myself pretty well and Im nothing if not
a coward When the time comes if the time
comes much like Judas sold out Jesus I will
sell myself out I’ve done it before

At this point Red starts twittering and twirling around
the room Dr Barnes unknowingly knocks into her as he
walks back over to the door

BOW TIE
Please Were trying to make him come across as
a sane human being You keep flitting around
like that and hes going to end up with a year
of electroshock treatments

Dr Barnes starts to say something when The Candy Striper
with straight blue hair walks in From her POV Phil is
alone with the doctor

CANDY STRIPER
Doctorone of the patients is having an
episode It’s the guy who never speaks tonight
he decided to yell

DR BARNES
We’1ll finish this later Stanton

Phil watches them leave

PHIL
That was fun

PURPLE OLD LADY
Well it beats working for the phone company

Phil laughs then gets out of bed
PHIL
If you don’t mind I need a shower
INT PHIL’S HOSPITAL BATHROOM A FEW MINUTES LATER
Phil is in the shower The room fills with steam Emme
fades into view and writes on his mirror I will get you

out I will not betray your trust I will help you

The water turns off Emme fades away Phil steps out
grabs a towel sees the mirror and smiles

EXTINT PHIL’S HOUSE SAME

Emme enters the kitchen She looks for food to feed
Harvey Rose walks in Harvey goes to her

ROSE
You’re wrong

EMME
I know

ROSE

Do something about it
Emme doesn’t say anything

ROSE (CONT’D)
I’m not talking to you Or seeing you anymore

Emme walks to her Rose picks up Harvey and goes into the
other room Emme starts to follow but Mike and Grace
enter she notices the cat bowl

GRACE
Phil has a cat I shudder to think what else my
dear brother is not telling me

From their POV they dont see Emme Mike studies her face
he hesitates lets the moment pass

GRACE (CONTD)
You said if I came wed be able to help Phil
What are we looking for

MIKE
Emme

GRACE
Youre kidding me right

MIKE
She’s a real person Grace With family and
friends

Mike glances about the house Emme waits for him to
acknowledge that he sees her From his POV he still
doesnt see Emme

MIKE (CONTD)

Phil isnt lying Emme is invisible I saw her
with my own two eyes Only once But I saw her
And if I have to swear that under oath because
you wont give up this ridiculous idea of having
him committedI will So in a nutshell that
is what I know What I dont know is when or if
Ill ever see Emme again how to help Phil and
why you wont admit that you’re in love with me

Grace goes charging into the living room where she is
surprised to find Rose and Harvey snuggled on the couch
Mike and Emme follow her

ROSE

MIKE

You must be Rose This is Emme’s niece

GRACE
(reacts) Im Grace Phils sister

ROSE
He can see my Aunt So can I He’s not crazy

GRACE
(plays along) Is she here now

Rose looks right through her Aunt

ROSE
No

Mike sniffs he knows Emme is there but he doesn’t see
her

MIKE
Not everyone can see her all the time

ROSE

I can I just don’t want too
GRACE

Why not
ROSE

Because she’s not helping Phil

GRACE
Why won’t she help Phil

Rose Harvey in her arms stares Emme down

ROSE
Because she’s a big fat scaredy cat (pause) Can
I keep him til Phil comes home I’11 take good
care of him

MIKE
Sure Let me get you his food

Rose glares at her Aunt then leaves with Mike Emme is
devastated

EMME
Let her see me Let her see me Let her see me

Grace’s POV she sees Emme but she fades away so fast she
cant truly believe it She sinks onto the ottoman Mike
comes back into the room

MIKE
See Emme is a real person

GRACE
(stammers) I came here hoping there would be
some kind of reasonable explanation for Phils
predicament Im sorry I have to help Phil
the only way I know how

MIKE
Youre afraid Afraid to trust Why couldnt
you trust us Or do you really not love me
enough

GRACE

It was too fast too easy

MIKE
To leave No shit I got whiplash

GRACE
No I mean us It happened too fast And too
easy

MIKE
Fast and easy who exactly were you ina
relationship with If you dont love me you
dont love me but tell me the truth I deserve
that much

Emme feeling like an intruder goes into the kitchen

GRACE

We were too comfortable we had The-you-sleep-—
on-that-side-of-the bed-I-sleep-on-this-side-of-
the-bed-he-likes-to-read-the-comics-first-leaves-
the-toilet-seat up-she-squeezes-the-toothpaste-
from-the-wrong-end-type of love There were no
surprises No mystery It was the why-dont-—we-
get-married-we ve-been-together-long-enough

love

MIKE
Did you ever stop to think that the fact that
you refuse to get into bed until youve taken a
shower and that you only eat the tops of muffins
is why I love you And if you want surprises
Heres one every-single-time-I-see you-you-take-
my-breath-away Even after all this crap So
dont tell me thats the reason you left
theres got to be more to it than that

GRACE
Dont you think I know its stupid and
irrational That I’m stupid and irrational

They hold a look Grace pulls him into a kiss never once
do their lips stray from each other then alarmed by her
ardor she disentangles herself

MIKE
(softly) Surprise

Nathaniel slowly appears in the open doorway Grace and
Mike recoil

NATHANIEL
Hi you must be Grace Stanton

Emme hears his voice and steps in from the kitchen

MIKE
Who the fuck are you

NATHANIEL
Im Nathaniel West a reporter for Weekend News
I was wondering if you had any comment about
committing your brother

MIKE
That’s a personal matter

NATHANTEL
Well since weve shown the footage of Mr
Stanton racing into on-coming traffic Channel
Four News has been deluged with phone calls
about your brother It seems the public is very
much concerned about him

GRACE
My brother is in deep emotional pain and needs
help The fact that you can stand there and mock
him makes me sick

MIKE
Youre trespassing Mr West

NATHANIEL
Didnt you tell Ms Stanton that you saw the
invisible Emme Taylor with your own two eyes
Care to comment

Mike pushes him out of the house Nathaniel locks in on
Emme and pointedly smiles at her

EXT PLAYGROUND VENICE CANALS SAME

Emme The Invisibles and many other Invisibles are
crowded in the park

BOW TIE
Emme just show yourself and stop this or
disappear for good

Emme reacts she’s been waiting to hear this

EMME

BLONDE OLD LADY

kettle of she left for cigarettes and never
came back fish

EMME
But you said I should show myself or disappear
forever so you know you know theres a way I
can be with my husband and son

Red stops swinging

RED GALOSHES
Theyre dead Theres no way to be with them
unless you’re dead

EMME
There has to be There has to be a place between
living and dead where I can be with them again
why else would I be like this

Purple puts her arms around Emme

PURPLE OLD LADY
Youre not speaking rationally

RED GALOSHES
When youre dead youre dead Theres no in-
between thing Sure there are ghost and spirits
and such but that’s only when the dead are
restless or have unfinished business Your
husbands life was fulfilled theres no reason
for him to come back

EMME
That cant be He needs to They have too
Thats why Im invisible that has to be why Im
invisible

Emme loses it and rushes off

INT PSYCH WARD SOCIAL ROOM TWO WEEKS LATER DAY

Phil is playing cards with Red Galoshes Grace shows up
From her POV hes playing alone She steps into the room
Red fades from view

GRACE
Hey

PHIL
Hey yourself Still having me committed

GRACE
Of course not

PHIL
I always know when you’re lying

Grace looks around the room The other patients who are
worse off than Phil scare her

PHIL (CONTD)
She’s not here

GRACE
And even if she was I wouldn’t see her Isnt
that all so convenient

They hold a look

GRACE (CONT’D)
You didn’t hurt her did you I mean you know

PHIL
How can you ask me that Listen I know this is
hard to believe As certain as you are that

you love Mike and will always love Mike
Thats how certain I am that Emme exists The
difference is Ive admitted that she exists and
ended up here

Grace pulls her eyes from his and looks at the floor

PHIL (CONTD)
(softly) And out of the two of us Im the lucky
one

Grace gets up and is startled to come face to face with
The Candy Striper in her candy striper uniform

CANDY STRIPER
It’s time to go back to your room And Dr
Barnes is waiting for you Ms Stanton

Grace looks at her brother and leaves

EXT VENICE GRAMMAR SCHOOL INT GYM LATER

Emme enters the school then walks down to the Survivors
Group meeting and sits in a chair in the back

CHIRPY
You feel guilty because your own fear of death
prevented you from truly connecting with your
son as he got ready to make that journey on his
own

Before anyone can argue Stephanie sees Emme in the back of
the room and stops the meeting The Group’s POV Some see
Emme Some dont

STEPHANIE
That’s it for today See you next week

Stephanie collects the folding chairs a few people stop to
help her stack them against the stage As the last person
meanders out of the gym she pulls herself up onto the edge
of the stage

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
I knew youd be back

Emme looks around to see who she’s talking too

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
They really should call it the sixth stage of
grief But I suppose no one would believe it I
know I didn’t (she ruefully sighs) But the
best grief counselors are the ones who have
actually experienced the grief

Emme reacts she feels her pain and walks to the stage

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
Its a strange way to be Theres so much power
so much controland when youre coming from a
place where you had virtually no control over
anything its well a struggle to give it up

EMME
So why bother Why not just give in to it and
let it sweep you away Or use it to your
advantage like Nathaniel West

STEPHANIE
Sweep you where Theres no place it can take
you Its not like youre Houdini and its some
grand illusion Other than becoming a carpet
bagger like West what would you do

EMME
What’s so bad about living like Nathaniel

STEPHANIE
Hes not connected to anything to anyone How
can anyone live a life like that Even youyou
know that if your sister took your niece from
you Seriously Emme living like you are now
why

Emme climbs up on stage and lays down
EMME

No one stares at me anymore No one feels sorry
for me anymore I can come and go as I please

STEPHANIE
Im not talking about physical changes They
dont mean shit What’s changed

EMME

The choice Thats what changed
STEPHANIE

Bullshit
EMME

It means I lived

STEPHANIE
It was a random accident Every moment leading
up to that moment wasnt the linchpin that made
what happened happen It happened Thats not
what this is about For once give me an honest
answer Why invisible why now

EMME
Because because I might be okay I might be
okay one day with the fact that they left

Stephanie stands up she glares down at her
STEPHANIE
That’s your problem They didnt leave Emme
they died Theres a fucking difference

Stephanie walks out of the gym she closes the lights
leaving Emme in the dark

INT PHIL’S HOSPITAL ROOM SAME

Deandra walks in as Phil plays a game of checkers with
Blonde Old Lady Her POV Phil is alone

DEANDRA
So should I be upset that you threw me over for
an invisible woman

Phil smiles at her Blonde fades away but not before
beating him

INT MORGAN’S HOUSE KITCHEN LATER

Morgan is a disheveled mess she hasn’t slept she

hasn’t showered and right now she’s rearranging her
kitchen Oliver is kneeling on the floor sorting supplies

MORGAN
In your gut Deep down in your gut what do you
think happened

OLIVER
Weve gone over this before Deep down in my
gutI know shes turned invisible

Morgan picks up a jar of peanut butter She stares
intently at it

MORGAN
You told me to believe in her strength Believe
in good coming out of bad Believe in what you
cant see I didnt think that meant indulging a
childs fantasy

Oliver stops what he’s doing

OLIVER
I saw her You saw her

MORGAN
I dont know what I saw And youre only witness
is a man residing in a psych ward Maybe youre
wrong

OLIVER
I know what I saw and who I saw

Through the window in the backyard Emme tries to get Rose
to speak to her

MORGAN
Rose I understand shes a child But what the
hell has gotten into you

OLIVER
Children have been known to be right

MORGAN
See her

Morgan points Oliver looks Their POV Rose is alone

MORGAN (CONTD)
Shes seeing people who dont exist We need to
get her help Is this your way of coping Of
dealing with the fact that our daughter could
be (struggles) Schizophrenic

Oliver is at a loss for words

MORGAN (CONTD)
I will do everything in my power to help her and
if that means leaving you to do it So be it

The conversation has become more than they can handle
Morgan abruptly leaves the room Oliver starts to follow
her than goes in the other direction

EXT MORGAN’S BACKYARD VENICE CANALS SAME

of the backyard

INT PHIL’S HOSPITAL ROOM SAME
Deandra sits Phil is finishing up his story

PHIL
You were right I was detached I didn’t give a
a shit

Deandra studies him She hesitates then gets it

DEANDRA
And now you do I don’t hate you I should But
I don’t I think we were both using this
relationship as a way to hide

Deandra leans back and studies him

DEANDRA (CONTD)
You know We’ve all done it Hidden ourselves
in front of the world You run into the store
for a quick errand you feel like shit and you
dont want anyone to see you So you hold
yourself a certain way you hide in your body
and no one notices you If you do that enough
I suppose well I suppose it’s possible

A grateful Phil smiles at her

EXT VENICE CANALS SAME

Emme sits in a canoe in the middle of the canals Regulars
and Invisibles stroll She watches them as they coexist
with relative ease

INT PHIL’S HOSPITAL ROOM A FEW DAYS LATER

Emme watches Phil sleep Red Galoshes is knitting at the
edge of his bed

RED GALOSHES
Don’t worry It will be over soon

With that she pats Emme’s hand and simply disappears Emme
leans over the checker board and makes a move Nathaniel
fades into view then jumps one of her checkers Startled
Emme recoils

NATHANTEL
Not happy to see me Used to play with my
grandfather (points to his foot) It wasnt that
I was picked last in gym class I just wasnt
picked

EMME
Is that why you’re a prick

NATHANIEL
A prick who is working on the biggest story of
his life When I let this sucker out it will
be huge And
it’s taking me from the cheap seats of an
affiliate news station to the network show

EMME
What about Phil How can you do this to him

NATHANTEL
Me I didn’t put him here (Pause) You did this
Who are you considering Phil Your family At
least my invisibility serves a greater purpose

EMME
Yeah you’re own

NATHANTEL
I may be many things manipulative
condescending and at times obnoxious but I can
truly say that Ive never put anyones life in
danger can you

Nathaniel jumps a King Red over a black then fades away
Emme pulls her spin top out her pocket she puts it on
Phil’s tray then does the same

EXT MORGAN’S BACKYARD VENICE CANALS SAME

ROSE

That day he was talking to Aunt Emme in the
tree not a cat I was helping Aunt Emme when I
said it was a cat

Morgan isn’t sure what to be upset about

MORGAN
You lied You know how I feel about lying

ROSE
Yeah and that wouldn’t have freaked you out

MORGAN
Good point Are you lying about anything now

Rose gives the question thoughtful consideration

ROSE
Im not lying Aunt Emme is invisible

MORGAN
But sweetie real people cant turn invisible

ROSE
Real people turn invisible every day

MORGAN
(sighs) Honey I dont know what to believe I
dont want to believe something bad happened to
Emme And as much as I want too I dont think I
can believe she turned invisible

Rose watches as her mother tries to hold back her tears
and presses herself against Morgans chest

ROSE
I told her I won’t see her anymore Phil helped
her and she wont help him She’s a fink

Rose grabs Harvey and walks inside Morgan is lost She
watches her daughter then gets up and walks out of the

In the kitchen she stops at the butcher block stares at
the missing knives

MORGAN (CONTD)

Morgan gets under the covers lets her wet hair cascade to
her shoulders falls back onto the pillows When she curls
herself to the side Emme lays beside her When her steady
breathing gives way to tortured sobs Emme spoons her with
arms she can’t feel and talks to her

EMME
This is not the life I signed on for I had a
husband I had a son I had a purpose Now I
dont Now the grief I felt when they left has
been replaced with forgetfulness

(MORE)

EMME (CONTD)
Daniels voice is no longer familiar to me I
vaguely remember the tilt of his chin When Im
not near photographs their faces fade from my
view I used to be able to pull my memory of
them at a moments notice Now all I notice are
the moments when I no longer remember their

faces Which only proves I wasn’t worthy of
their love

Morgan her sobs slowly dwindling turns to Emme Her eyes
betray her fear of believing in what she cant see Emme
brushes a lock of hair off her sister’s forehead Morgan
looks through Emme Still not ready for her Emme turns
and lies on her back

EMME (CONTD)
I thought I could live like this Away from you

closer to them I thought that’s what I wanted
what I needed

Morgan finally falls asleep Emme kisses her then gets up
and opens the window She pulls a card from her pocket
picks up the phone dials

fired for this idiotic prank

MORGAN
This note was written by my sister Its her
handwriting My sister isn’t missing she turned
invisible

DR BARNES
(softens) Oh I’m sorry I know you’re worried
aboutbut people dont turn invisible Dont
you think Id be overjoyed if all the men women
and children who go missing every single day had
really just turned invisible of their own free
will But thats not the case

MORGAN
She’s invisible I know she’s invisible

DR BARNES
If that’s what gets you through this then who am
I to argue with you But as for my patient is
concerned he’s not stable

MIKE
He’s stable He’s as stable as any of us

Dr Barnes gives them a look Emme disappears for good

DR BARNES
That’s not saying much Now I don’t know what’s
going on But you know the deal Grace is
committing her brother and like every poor
schmuck about to be committed he gets a sanity
hearing to prove whether or not he should be
committed Oh and by the way in ninety percent
of all sanity hearings the defendant is
committed But what do I know If you think he
shouldnt be committed prove that he’s sane

Dr Barnes walks away Grace has no idea what to do Mike
reaches for her Grace her heart breaking for so many
reasons walks away Morgan Oliver and Mike are in shock

JUDGE
This is not a trial This is a hearing (pause)
We are here today to decide if Mr Phillip
Stanton is of sound mind and body These are the
issues that everyone in this courtroom is aware
of What we do not know is Mr Stantons point
of view

The hospital lawyer starts to speak but Dr Barnes pops
up

DR BARNES
But we carefully outlined that

JUDGE
Yes but we are not here to decide if you are of
sound mind and body therefore we will hear from
Mr Stanton Mr Stanton are you sure you don’t
want legal counsel

PHIL
I’m sure your honor

JUDGE
Let the record state that upon further inquiry
Mr Stanton refused counsel And so Mr Stanton
you think youre sane And that a whole society
of invisible people exist out there

PHIL
Yes your honor

JUDGE
Well then let’s start

INT COURTROOM twenty mintues later
Dr Barnes and his lawyers are quietly arguing

LAWYER 1
That’s not a good idea

Dr BARNES
I’m not paying you to judge my ideas

Dr Barnes gets up and smiles at the judge and those in
the courtroom

DR BARNES (CONTD)
If you don’t mind your Honor I’m going to take
over for a bit (He coughs then puts on his
best smile) A sane man does not run into
oncoming traffic because hes trying to save the
life of person no one else can see Was this a
psychotic episode maybe but its been six
weeks and he still believes unwaveringly and
with more conviction I might add than Billy
Graham at a revival meeting that he sees
invisible people And in my humble opinion I see
this as cry for help

INT COURTROOM LATER THAT MORNING
Ernie is on the stand

DR BARNES
And so you admit that Phil has been depressed
and before his unfortunate run into oncoming
traffic you had fired him

ERNIE
Yes

DR BARNES
And before that had he ever mentioned seeing
invisible people

ERNIE
No not once (leans in) I just hope he’s
getting the help he needs He was one of our
star employees and we’d do anything to help him
As a matter of fact even though we fired him we
haven’t cut off his medical benefits

Phil reacts

EXT COURTROOM LATER THAT MORNING
Nathaniel stands in front of the camera

NATHANIEL
Much has been left unsaid as the experts debate
this theory of invisibility Will the judge rule
that Phil is sane do invisible people really
exist All these questions and many more will be
answered today

follows him motions Toni to follow him as well
