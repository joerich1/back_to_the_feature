A voice Female refined
LADY SMALLWOOD
Mr Magnussen please state you

full name for the record

MAGNUSSEN
Charles Augustus Magnussen

Fading in on

INT ENQUIRY ROOM - DAY 2

A government Enquiry The strip-lit room the horse-shoe
table of MPs facing the accused The speaker is Lady
Smallwood - fifties wiry sharp-eyed

The accused - calmly folded hands on a table top Next to
them a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles Magnussen

His voice is soft reasonable a Danish accent

LADY SMALLWOOD
Mr Magnussen how would you
describe your influence over the
Prime Minister

MAGNUSSEN
The British Prime Minster

LADY SMALLWOOD
Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known

MAGNUSSEN
I never had the slightest influence
over any of them Why would I

Lady Smallwood is consulting some notes

LADY SMALLWOOD
I notice you’ve had seven meetings
at Downing Street this year Why

MAGNUSSEN
Because I was invited

LADY SMALLWOOD
Can you recall the subjects under
discussion

MAGNUSSEN
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate

One of the MPs round the table - Garvie bullish self-
righteous

GARVIE
Do you think it’s right that a
newspaper proprietor - a private
individual and in fact a foreign
national - should have such regular
access to our Prime Minister

On Magnussen’s clasped hands He now reaches for gold-rimmed
spectacles unfolds them

Magnussen’s POV The round glittering lenses raise up - now
looking through them

A heads-up display Text streaming across Magnussen’s view -
like Sherlock’s text-vision but apparently electronically
originated A 3D projection with the lenses

Cursors quiver around Garvie’s face - facial recognition
software Now his name flickers into position next to his
face

MAGNUSSEN
I don’t think it’s wrong that a
rivate individual should accept an
invitation However you have my
sincere apologies for being
foreign

GARVIE
That’s not what I meant that’s not
in any way -

LADY SMALLWOOD
Mr Magnussen can you recall an
occasion when your remarks could
have influenced government policy

Still from Magnussen’s POV as he swivels to look at her
Again the cursor’s flicker round her face then the text

PRESSURE POINT searching
The word searching is blinking work in progress

MAGNUSSEN
No

LADY SMALLWOOD
Or the Prime Minister’s thinking in
any way

Magnussen now removing his spectacles He polishes them with
a little cloth - his face still unseen

MAGNUSSEN
Not that I recall

Magnussen’s POV He raises the spectacles again The text
reappears the word searching still blinking

Now the word searching is replaced by the word HUSBAND

On Magnussen’s eyes behind the round lenses They gleam for
a moment - result

LADY SMALLWOOD
Are you sure

MAGNUSSEN
I have an excellent memory
CUT TO
EXT APPLEDORE - NIGHT 3

The big black car now sweeping between imposing gateposts a
wide gracious driveway Security men everywhere and looming
at the centre -

- a huge grand house But modern - like a castle built in
the Apple era

CUT TO

INT APPLEDORE HALLWAY - NIGHT 4

Looking down on a giant hallway All white and gleaming
carved out of icebergs This place is pristine and shining
and perfect - and as soulless as an iPad It’s the Citizen
Kane mansion for the computer age

Now close on Magnussen’s eyes gleaming through the gold
rims the white walls reflected as he passes along them

CUT TO
EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

INT APPLEDOREMAGNUSSEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT 5

Stylish minimalist modern A bowl of fruit is a burst of
colour

Magnussen’s shadow passing over the walls Behind the desk
there is a door Magnussen’s shadow pauses there

Again on those gleaming eyes in the gold rims
He steps forward opening the door

CUT TO

INT APPLEDOREMAGNUSSEN’S BASEMENT - NIGHT 6

A spiral staircase down into the shadows of the basement - a
different world down here gloomy spooky dusty pools of
light and shadow

Magnussen descends the staircase

Now he’s walking among an extraordinary maze of filing
cabinets and crammed bookshelves

Strange details picked out as he moves - a clown costume and
mask hanging from a coatstand

An elegant statue holding a mobile phone
A stuffed otter in a glass case

Magnussen now at a filing cabinet - the one next to the
statue with the mobile phone He pulls open the top drawer

Flicks among the files extracts on It is labeled SMALLWOOD
A photograph of Lady Smallwood is attached to the cover

He opens it

Close on Magnussen’s eyes in the gold rims - reading avid
CUT TO

INT CLUB - NIGHT 7

A club somewhere in Whitehall - all leather armchairs and
wood panelling

On Lady Smallwood Sitting at a table Working late - there’s
a pot of coffee and papers spread in front of her

Takes a moment pinches the bridge of her nose - long night

As she lowers her hand again she startles

Lady Smallwood’s POV Seated opposite at a table at the
other side of the room is Charles Augustus Magnussen

He’s smiling placidly at her eyes twinkling through his gold
rims

It’s the first proper look at him - he’s serene smiling
sleek At first glance benevolent But the smile is too
fixed the eyes too black and unblinking

MAGNUSSEN
May I join you

LADY SMALLWOOD
I don’t think it’s appropriate

MAGNUSSEN
It isn’t

But he’s already risen crossed to her He takes the empty
seat facing her moves it round the side of her table He
sits close to her

LADY SMALLWOOD
Mr Magnussen outside the enquiry
we can have no contact no
communication at all -

She breaks off because Magnussen has reached and placed his
hand over hers

LADY SMALLWOOD
Please don’t do that

MAGNUSSEN
In 1982 your husband corresponded
with Helen Elizabeth Morrison -

LADY SMALLWOOD
That was before I knew him

MAGNUSSEN
The letters were lively loving
some would say explicit And
currently in my possession

LADY SMALLWOOD
Would you please move your hand

MAGNUSSEN
“I long my darling to know the
touch of your body - “

LADY SMALLWOOD
I know what was in the letters

MAGNUSSEN
She was fifteen

On Lady Smallwood A moment to compose herself She’s been
through this before

LADY SMALLWOOD
she looked older

MAGNUSSEN
She looked delicious We have
photographs too - the ones she sent
him
(Smack lips)
Yum yum

LADY SMALLWOOD
He was unaware of her age He met
her only once before the letters
began and nothing happened When he
discovered the truth he stopped
immediately Those are the facts

MAGNUSSEN
Facts are for history books I work
in news

She looks at him for a moment - so full of hatred but
silent

LADY SMALLWOOD
- your hand is sweating

MAGNUSSEN
Always I’m afraid I have a
condition

LADY SMALLWOOD
It’s disgusting

MAGNUSSEN
I’m used to it The whole world is
wet to my touch

Leans in sniffs at her

LADY SMALLWOOD
I will call someone I will have
you removed

MAGNUSSEN
What is that Claire De La Lune
Bit young for you isn’t it

Lady Smallwood glaring at him now

MAGNUSSEN
Ohh now you want to hit me Could
you still 26 years seven months
and twelve days since you were a
professional gymnast Little old
lady now Perhaps you should settle
for calling someone

She just stares at him Rage and disgust almost to the point
of tears

MAGNUSSEN
Well

She still says nothing

( )
EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

MAGNUSSEN
Go on do it call someone

She does nothing

MAGNUSSEN
Of course not Because now there
are consequences I have the
letters therefore I have you

LADY SMALLWOOD
This is blackmail

MAGNUSSEN
No Blackmail is nothing This is
ownership

LADY SMALLWOOD
You do not own me

Magnussen just smiles Now leans in and very deliberately
licks the side of her face A long rasping lick right up
from her neck to her hairline It’s not sexual in any way -
just a terrible matter of fact demonstration

As he does it

MAGNUSSEN
I don’t even know why I did that I
just could
(Smacks lips)
Yes Claire De La Lune Never
tastes like it smells does it

He takes her napkin dabs at his mouth He now rises starts
to leave He barely glances at the waiter as he goes

MAGNUSSEN
Lady Smallwood’s bill is on me See
to it

WAITER

Yes Mr Magnussen

On Lady Smallwood sitting trembling with rage and disgust
The waiter just stands there embarrassed waiting

She puts a hand to where he licked her face She now scrubs
at it with her handkerchief A big sigh almost a sob

Her Chauffeur is glancing in the rearview mirror

CHAUFFEUR
You all right ma’am

AADY SMALLWOOD
Fine yes yes

Too quick too snappy The Chauffeur glances in the mirror

AADY SMALLWOOD
Magnussen Charles Augustus
Magnussen No one stands up to him
No one dares no one even tries
There isn’t a man or woman in
England capable of stopping that
disgusting creature from -

And she breaks off Because she has an idea Frowning now
thinking it through No But could that work

CHAUFFEUR

CHAUFFEUR

soldiers machine guns firing -

- but this time there’s something different It is intercut
with flashes of his adventures with Sherlock - chasing the
Hound on the moors racing through London after the taxi
battling the drug cartel -

Now on John twitching in his sleep Again it’s similar to
the shot in Pink but this time Mary is curled up next to
him A brief shot of his left hand - the tremor from A Study
In Pink is back

More flashes of Afghanistan more flashes of his Sherlock
adventures - then -

A doorbell rings
John’s eyes snap open - instantly awake like a soldier

fighting the impulse to look behind her and check he’s not

goes clattering -

- now twists him round throws him at the wall

SHERLOCK
Whatever you feel you ought to tell
them
MOLLY

Oh I see You give me the big dark
eyes and the deep deep voice and
I’m supposed to lie for you

She just slaps him hard across the face And again And
again He stands there not reacting

MOLLY
How dare you throw away the
beautiful gifts you were born with
and how dare you betray the love of
your friends Say you’re sorry

SHERLOCK
I’m sorry your engagement is
over
(Stroking his slapped
face)
Though I’m fairly grateful for the
lack of a ring

MOLLY
Stop it just stop it

JOHN
Jesus Sherlock

MOLLY
And we’re just having a break It
was a mutual agreement that he
needed more space

JOHN
(To Sherlock)
If you were anywhere near this kind
of thing again you couldve
phoned you could’ve talked to me -

SHERLOCK
Oh please do relax This is all
part of a case

JOHN
What case would need you doing
this

SHERLOCK

I might as well ask you why you’ve
started cycling to work

JOHN
No we’re not playing this game

SHERLOCK
Quite recently I’d say But you’re
very determined about it

JOHN
Not interested

WIGGINS
Iam Ow

Wiggins is flinching back from Mary
MARY
Sorry you moved It is just a
sprain though

WIGGINS
Yeah somebody hit me

He flashes a look a John - who just gives him the stare

WIGGINS
Just some guy
OHN
Probably some addict in need of a

fix
He makes this remark directly at Sherlock pointedly
But Sherlock looks pointedly back at him

SHERLOCK
Yes in a way I think it was

And John feels pinioned for a moment - Sherlock reading him
as usual

WIGGINS
Is it his shirt

Sherlock looks quickly back to Wiggins

SHERLOCK
I’m sorry

WIGGINS
Is that how you know about the
cycling Sorry should have let you
do it

SHERLOCK

WIGGINS (contd)
I’ve always read that blog Not
been much on it lately I thought
youd retired

SHERLOCK
The band split up Tell me about
the shirt

WIGGINS

Well it’s the creases isn’t it
The two creases down the front
It’s been recently folded but it’s
not new

(To John)

You must have dressed in a hurry
tonight so all your shirts must be
kept like that But why Maybe cos
you cycle to work every morning
shower when you get there and then
dress in the clothes you brought
with you You keep your shirts
folded ready to pack

Sherlock prowling closer to Wiggins taking an interest now

SHERLOCK
Not bad

WIGGINS
(Emboldened now)
And I further deduce you’ve only
started recently because you’ve
got a bit of chafing

SHERLOCK
No he always walks like that
Remind me - what’s your name

WIGGINS

They call me the Wig
SHERLOCK

No they don’t
WIGGINS

Well they call me Wiggsy
SHERLOCK

Nope

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

23

SHERLOCK
I have to filter out a lot of
witless babble - I’ve got Mrs
Hudson on semi-permanent mute
Magnussen is much more than a
newspaper owner

JOHN
What is he

SHERLOCK
A cancer And do you know the best
thing about cancer

JOHN

Not off the top of my head
SHERLOCK

Untreated it will kill you
JOHN

Why’s that the best thing

memory

Mycroft now entering John behind him

MYCROFT
Some members of your little fan
club Do be polite they’re
entirely trustworthy and even
willing to search the toxic waste

flat You’re a celebrity these
days Sherlock you can’t afford a

drug habit
SHERLOCK

I don’t have a drug habit
JOHN

What happened to my chair
SHERLOCK

It was blocking my view of the

kitchen
JOHN

It’s good to be missed
SHERLOCK

opportunity

JOHN
You saw the kitchen

MYCROFT
What have you found so far Clearly
nothing

SHERLOCK
There’s nothing to find

MYCROFT
Your bedroom door is shut You
haven’t been home all night so why
has a man who has never knowingly
closed a door without a direct
order from his mother bothered to
do so on this occasion I
understand a need for privacy but
usually when one is inside the
room

He starts striding for the door
On Sherlock flustering

SHERLOCK
Okay stop just stop Point made

On John so ashamed for his friend

JOHN
Oh Jesus Sherlock

Mycroft as turned to look wearily at his brother

MYCROFT
I shall have to phone our parents
of course In Oklahoma It won’t be
the first time your substance abuse
has wreaked havoc with their line

dancing

SHERLOCK
It’s not what you think It’s for a
case

MYCROFT
What case could possibly justify
this

SHERLOCK
Magnussen

On Mycroft His face changes at that word There’s a new
chill in the room

SHERLOCK
Charles Augustus Magnussen

On Mycroft - it’s like his face has gone gray a blood-
draining moment He now strides towards Anderson

MYCROFT
That name you think you may have
just heard - you were mistaken
Leave now - and if you ever mention
hearing that name in this room or
this context I guarantee you on
behalf of the British security
services that there will be
material found on your computer
hard drives resulting in your
immediate incarceration Don’t
reply to me just look frightened
and scuttle Go Now go

Anderson and Benji scuttling away

MYCROFT
(To John)
I hope I don’t have to threaten you
as well
JOHN
I think wed both find that
embarrassing
MYCROFT

(To Sherlock)
Magnussen is not your business

SHERLOCK
You mean he’s yours

MYCROFT
You may consider him under my
protection

SHERLOCK
I consider you under his thumb

MYCROFT
If you go against Magnussen you
will find yourself going against
me

SHERLOCK
Okay I’11 let you know if I
notice Now what was I going to
say Oh yes Bye bye

Sherlock has gone to the door and opened it for Mycroft
Mycroft stares at him simmering

MYCROFT
Unwise brother mine

SHERLOCK
Speaking of which

Sherlock has pulled his phone from his pocket now clicks it -
A recording of Mycroft’s voice from a few moments ago

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 0909

MYCROFT
(From phone)
I guarantee you on behalf of the
British security services that
there will be material found on
your computer hard drives resulting
in your immediate incarceration

Instinctively Mycroft steps forward to grab the phone -

- explosively Sherlock grabs his wrist twists him round
and slams him against the wall A shocking moment of
violence

SHERLOCK
Brother mine - don’t appal me when
I’m high

Mycroft staring furious
John straight in there ready to intervene

JOHN
Mycroft don’t say another word
just go He could snap you in two
And right now I’m slightly worried
that he might

A moment - a sardonic smile from Sherlock He steps back from
his brother

JOHN
Don’t speak Just leave

Mycroft gathers as much of his dignity as he can
Straightens his tie Leaves

Silence between the two men They look at each other
Finally

JOHN
Magnussen

SHERLOCK
What time is it

JOHN
About eight

SHERLOCK
I’1l be meeting him in three hours
I need a bath

Sherlock how heading for the bathroom
JOHN

A case you said What kind of
case

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

SHERLOCK
Too big too dangerous not for any
sane individual to be involved in

JOHN
Trying to put me off

SHERLOCK
God no Trying to recruit you

He disappears into the bathroom A moment later we hear a
bath being run

On John contemplative He goes to Sherlocks bedroom door
Very quietly so Sherlock can’t hear he tries the handle

Locked
He goes out to the hallway where Sherlock’s coat is hanging

Removes a bunch of keys from Sherlock’s pocket now heads
back to Sherlock’s bedroom -

- and comes to a freezing halt

Because there’s a click and Sherlock’s door is unlocking
from the inside

John just stands and stares as the door opens and a woman
wearing one of Sherlock’s shirts cautiously emerges

She gives a little yelp on seeing John -

JANINE
Oh John hi How are you

It’s Janine from the The Sign Of Three - Sherlock’s dancing
partner

JOHN
Janine

JANINE
Sorry not dressed Has everybody
gone I heard shouting

On John still trying to process this What What

JOHN
Yeah they’re gone

Janine has darted to the kitchen now

JANINE
God look at the time I’11l be
late Sounded like an argument -
was it Mike

JOHN
Mike

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 0909

JANINE

JOHN
Mycroft

JANINE

Listen could you be a love and
put some coffee on

JOHN

JANINE
Great thanks How’s Mary how’s

John floundering a bit has gone to a cupboard

JOHN
She’s fine we’re both fine -
JANINE
(Pointing to another
cupboard)
No it’s in there now Where’s

Sherl
A man in a daze John is moving to the other cupboard
JOHN
He’s having a bath I’m sure he’11

be out in a minute

JANINE
Oh like he ever is

And she darts to the bathroom slipping inside

JANINE
Morning Room for a little one

And the door closes
On John - more thunderstruck than any man ever What

CUT TO

27 INT 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 27

Some while later - early daylight Sherlock Holmes back to
his impeccable self is installing himself in his armchair

SHERLOCK
So Just a guess but you’ve
probably got some questions

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913
27

JOHN
Yeah one or two Pretty much

Glances round Janine is dashing round the kitchen getting
her things together She dashes off to Sherlock’s bedroom
(Pointedly Sherlock waits till she’s gone - throughout this
scene he makes sure he isn’t talking about Magnussen while
she can hear)

SHERLOCK
Naturally

JOHN
You have a girlfriend

SHERLOCK
Yes I have Okay Magnussen then
Magnussen is a shark Only way I
can describe him Ever been to the
shark tank at the London Aquarium
John - stood right at the glass
Those flat gliding faces Those
dead eyes That’s what he is I’ve
dealt with murderers psychopaths
Terrorists serial killers None of
them can turn my stomach like
Charles Augustus Magnussen

JOHN
« yes you have

SHERLOCK
- I’m sorry

JOHN
You have a girlfriend

SHERLOCK
What Yes Yes I’m going out with
Janine I thought that was fairly

obvious
JOHN
Yes Well yes - but you’re ina
relationship
SHERLOCK
Yes I am
JOHN

You and Janine

SHERLOCK
Yes me and Janine

JOHN
Do you want to elaborate

SHERLOCK
We’re in a good place It’s
very affirming

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

JOHN
You got that from a book

SHERLOCK
Everyone got that from a book

Janine now dashing through from the bedroom - pecks Sherlock
on the cheek She perches momentarily on the arm of
Sherlocks chair every inch the confident girlfriend

JANINE
Okay bad boys you two behave And
you Sherl youre going to tell me
where you were last night

SHERLOCK
Working

JANINE
Yeah working course you were I’m
the one who knows what you’re
really like remember

SHERLOCK
Well don’t you go letting on

And he gives her a finger tap on the nose - the loved-up
couple

John just staring his eyes off Maybe she is the one who
knows

JANINE
I might just actually
(to John)
Haven’t told Mary about this Kind
of wanted to surprise her

JOHN
Well I think you probably will

JANINE
But we’ll get you two round to
dinner really soon My place
though not the scuzz-dump

JOHN
Great Yeah Dinner yeah

Many thoughts are competing for space in John’s mind - all of
them labeled What

JANINE
Gotta dash brilliant to see you
Bye

She’s heading to the door Sherlock has leapt up to open the
door - the considerate boyfriend in the early days

SHERLOCK
Have a lovely day - call me later

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913
27

JANINE
Yeah might do might call you -
unless I see anyone prettier
(Grabs him kisses him)
Solve me a crime Sherlock Holmes

She goes rattling down the stairs

On Sherlock - one of those chilling moments The moment her
back is turned his face just drops All the warmth gone the
cold mask slams down This is fast though - so fast we’re
almost not sure we saw it

He closes the door

SHERLOCK
You know Magnussen as a newspaper
owner - but he is so much more than
that He has in his possession
the single greatest store of
dangerous and compromising
information this world has ever
seen He uses his power and wealth
to gain more information and the
more he acquires the greater his
wealth and power I’m not
exaggerating when I say he knows
the critical pressure point on
every person of note or influence
in the Western World and possibly
beyond He is the Napoleon of
blackmail He has created an
unassailable architecture of
forbidden knowledge - and it’s name
is Appledore

During the above he has opened his laptop tapped away Now
on the screen - of Magnussen’s house as seen in the opening

John now looking at the picture
A beat

JOHN
Dinner

SHERLOCK
Sorry what dinner

JOHN
We’re coming round to dinner me
and Mary With wine and
sitting

SHERLOCK
Seriously I just told you the
Western World is more or less run
from this house and you want to
talk about dinner

JOHN
Okay talk about the house

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

SHERLOCK
It is the greatest repository of
sensitive and dangerous information
anywhere in the world The
Alexandra Library of secrets and
scandals And none of it is ona
computer He’s smart computers can
be hacked It’s all on hard copy
in vaults underneath that house
And as long as its there the
personal freedom of anyone you’ve
ever met is a fantasy

JOHN
And this is the guy we’re going to
go and see

SHERLOCK
I have an appointment at his office
in two hours What do you think

JOHN
I think it’s strange you chose to
go back on drugs first

SHERLOCK
Surely it’s obvious why

A tap at the door Mrs Hudson popping her head round

MRS HUDSON
That was the doorbell Didn’t you

hear it

SHERLOCK
It’s in the fridge - it kept
ringing

MRS HUDSON
That’s not a fault Sherlock

JOHN
Who is it
On Mrs Hudson - clearly a little freaked almost
frightened
CUT TO

On the door as it pushed open to reveal -

- Sherlock and John standing either side of the fireplace
Tensed on their mettle

And now through the door three men All well built in dark
suits clearly private security They move swiftly and
efficiently round the room One of them is checking doors and
windows the other two go to John and Sherlock as if to
frisk them

Sherlock stands ready to be frisked

SHERLOCK
Go ahead
SECURITY MAN
(To John)
Sir

JOHN
Could I have a moment

SHERLOCK
He’s fine

They’re both now being frisked

JOHN
Okay I should probably mention -

Too late The Security Man has found something - he draws out
the tyre lever still jammed into John’s belt

JOHN
Doesn’t mean I’m not pleased to see
you

SHERLOCK
I can vouch for this man - he’s a
doctor

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913
29 29

As Sherlock says this the Security Man is taking Wiggins’
knife from John’s jacket pocket

SECURITY MAN
Then why’s he armed

JOHN
I’m off duty

SHERLOCK
This is Dr John Watson if you
know who I am you know who he is
Don’t you Mr Magnussen

His eyes go to -
Charles Augustus Magnussen standing in the doorway Smiling

SHERLOCK
I understood we were meeting at
your office

Magnussen’s eyes drift to Sherlock - calm indifferent He’s
stepping into room now Looking round - the mildest interest
almost amusement It’s a feature of Magnussen entering a
room that he does so as if he owns it Indifferent to the
presence of anyone else He behaves at all times as if
unobserved Completely unself-conscious - as if no one else
really matters

MAGNUSSEN
This is my office
(Gestures to his men)
Well it is now

SECURITY MAN
(Indicating John)
Sir this one

SHERLOCK
Get him a chair he can stay

MAGNUSSEN
He can stand

On John’s face the flicker of a frown - glances to Sherlock
Who gives a little nod just put up with it

Having taken some papers from the table Magnussen now
strolls over to the sofa sits reading

SHERLOCK
Mr Magnussen

Magnussen glances up - the mildest of interest

SHERLOCK
I have been asked to intercede with
you by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood On
the matter of her husband’s
letters

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913
29 29

Magnussen just stares unblinking at him Those blank eyes
that serene half-smile

SHERLOCK
Some time ago you brought pressure
on her concerning those letters
Given that the enquiry into your
newspapers that she was then
conducting has now foundered she
has asked me to negotiate with you
She would like the letters back

The blank eyes the smile
SHERLOCK

Lady Smallwood has empowered me to
act on her behalf

Magnussen nothing
Sherlock wading on
SHERLOCK
Obviously the letters are no

longer of any practical use to you
so with that in mind -

And abruptly Magnussen laughs
Sherlock staring coldly at him now

SHERLOCK
Something I said

MAGNUSSEN
No I was reading

He adjust his spectacles

MAGNUSSEN
There’s rather a lot
(Chuckles again)
Redbeard

On Sherlocks face - drops slightly What

MAGNUSSEN
Sorry you were probably talking

SHERLOCK
I was trying to explain that I am
acting on behalf of -

MAGNUSSEN
Bathroom

SECURITY MAN
Opposite the kitchen sir

MAGNUSSEN
Okay

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913
29 29

On Sherlock - so not used to this A beat Resumes

SHERLOCK
I have been asked to negotiate for
the return of the letters I am
aware that you do not make copies
of any sensitive -

MAGNUSSEN
Is it like the rest of the flat

SECURITY MAN
Sir

MAGNUSSEN
The bathroom

SECURITY MAN
Yes sir

MAGNUSSEN
Maybe not then You Brits what’s
the secret - no shame or no sense
of smell

SECURITY MAN
I don’t know sir

Again a beat on Sherlock Resumes

SHERLOCK
I’m aware you do not make copies of
sensitive documents so as not to
compromise their singular value
The return of the letters would be
a significant step then Am I
acceptable to you as an
intermediary

Magnussen just stares at him for a moment - that dreamy half
smile Finally

MAGNUSSEN
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood I like
her

And he smacks his lips again as he did just before he licked
her face

SHERLOCK
Mr Magnussen am I acceptable to
you as an intermediary

Magnussen just sits there for a moment contemplating Then
he raises a foot pushes the coffee table out of the way

MAGNUSSEN
You know why I like her She’s
English with a spine It’s like a
genetic experiment

He’s now strolling to the fireplace He flicks a finger at
the fire-place -

- Security Man quickly clears the fire-guard out of the way

MAGNUSSEN
The best thing about the English -
youre so domesticated All
standing around apologising
keeping your little heads down

He’s now standing at the fireplace like it’s a urinal We
hear him unzip

MAGNUSSEN
You can do what you like here
doesn’t matter no one’s ever going
to stop you A nation of
herbivores

We hear a steady stream now splashing on the coals
Sherlock stoney-faced
John raging but silent
MAGNUSSEN
I have interests all over the word
but everything starts in England
If it works here I try it ina
real country
He stands there utterly relaxed finishing up
Johns face is brick-red with fury
Sherlock is utterly cold
Magnussen now zipping up turning The Security Man has
stepped forward with a packet wet wipes Magnussen plucks a
couple out quickly cleans his hands
MAGNUSSEN
The United Kingdom - petrie dish to
the Western World
He tosses the tissues on the floor
MAGNUSSEN
Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need
those letters so I’m keeping them
Goodbye
He’s pulled what are clearly the letters from his jacket

MAGNUSSEN
Anyway They’re funny

He’s heading for the door

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

SHERLOCK
If you had no intention of
negotiating with me Why are you
here

MAGNUSSEN
Youre Sherlock Holmes you’re
famous I’m interested

SHERLOCK
In what

MAGNUSSEN
In you I’ve never had a detective
before

And out he goes His men follow
On John - a world of disgust and barely suppressed rage

JOHN
Jesus

SHERLOCK
Did you notice the one
extraordinary thing he did

John stares at him What
JOHN

There was a moment that kind of
stuck in the mind yeah

SHERLOCK
Exactly - when he let us see the
letters

JOHN
« OKay

SHERLOCK

So he’s brought them to London So
whatever he says he’s ready to
deal

But Sherlock’s mood has changed entirely - cheerful brisk
mission accomplished A burst of energy pulling on his
outdoor clothes

SHERLOCK
Magnussen won’t deal with anyone
until he’s found their weakness -
the pressure point he calls it So
clearly he believes I’m a drug
addict and no serious threat And
of course since he’s in town
tonight that means the letters
will be in the safe in his London
office while he goes to dinner
with the Marketing Group of Great
Britain from seven till ten

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Don’t bring a gun

JOHN
Why would I bring a gun

Sherlock is now hailing a cab

SHERLOCK
Or a knife or a tyre lever
Probably best not to do any arm-—
spraining but let’s see how the
evening goes

JOHN
You just assume I’m coming along

Sherlock is now hailing a cab

SHERLOCK

John coming through the doors looking around

A massive imposing lobby - this is place of terrible power
and influence all steel and mirrors

Where John stands is the outer area before the revolving
doors and the security desks There’s a coffee stall a shop
people waiting huge screens with newsreaders and news
footage from all round the world

As John moves we hold on one of the screens

A photograph of John Garvie from the opening scenes The
headline MP John Garvie arrested on charges of corruption

Sherlock moves to stand just behind John

SHERLOCK
Magnussen’s office is right at the
top just below his private flat
There are fourteen layers of
security between us and him two of
them not even legal in this
country Want to know how we’re
gong to break in

JOHN
Is that what we’re doing

SHERLOCK
Of course it’s what we’re doing

INT CAM TOWERENTRANCE LOBBY - NIGHT 33

A few minutes later John and Sherlock with Cappuccinos from
the coffee stall

They turn and Sherlock nods to the wall opposite - a cliff
of marble An unassuming door is set in the middle of it - a
small lift big enough for one or two people

SHERLOCK
Magnussen’s personal lift Goes
straight up to his penthouse and
office only he uses it Only his
keycard calls the lift - if anyone
else even tries security is
automatically informed

Sherlock produces a keycard

SHERLOCK
Standard keycard for the building
Nicked it yesterday This one only
gets us to the canteen If I tried
it on that lift right now what do
you think happens

Wider shot John and Sherlock in the background and
Imaginary Sherlock in the foreground using the card in the

slot

Instantly alarms go off and Security Men come racing over
grab Imaginary Sherlock pull him

JOHN
Alarms go off and you get dragged
away by security

SHERLOCK
Exactly

JOHN
Taken to some dark little room and
your head kicked in

SHERLOCK
Do we need so much colour

JOHN
Passes the time

SHERLOCK
But what if I do this

He takes the card and presses it against his mobile phone

SHERLOCK
Did you know John that if you
press a keycard against your mobile
phone for long enough the magnetic
strip get corrupted and the card
stops working

(MORE )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

SHERLOCK (contd)
Common problem - never put your
phone with your keycard If you
really want to screw things up you
can do this too

He’s now rubbing a magnet over the card

SHERLOCK
Now think about this What happens
if I try the card now

Wider shot again John and Sherlock in the background
Imaginary Sherlock in the foreground trying the card

JOHN
It still doesn’t work

Again alarms go off security men descend -

- but this time they all freeze-frame only John and Sherlock
remain animated in the background

SHERLOCK
But it won’t read as the wrong card
now it will read as corrupted

A second bunch of security men come dashing in - but the
freeze-frame too as Sherlock says

SHERLOCK
But if it’s corrupted they can’t
know it isn’t Magnussen Are they
going to risk dragging him off

JOHN
Probably not

All the security men disappear in multiple puffs of smoke

SHERLOCK
So what do they do What must they
do
JOHN
Well They check if it’s him or
not
SHERLOCK

There’s a camera at eye level at
the side of the door

Cut to neatly concealed little camera lens in the wall beside
the lift

The light on the little camera glows on

ID

I’ve been shopping

And now Sherlock is now marching over to the lift Calm and
confident he slips his key card in the slot

SHERLOCK
Here we go then

A silence -

- nothing happens No alarms nothing John looks nervously
round

And then it happens for real -

- the little light comes on next to the lens Sherlock gives
a big smile into the camera

This time we pan to the astonished face of the PA and -

- it’s Janine

She stares in disbelief What What

Wider a Security Officer pops his head round the office
door

SECURITY OFFICER
Everything okay

Janine hurriedly steps between the monitor and the Security

SHERLOCK

And Sherlock reaches into his coat pocket - the one he patted
- and produces a little ring box Flips it open reveal an

engagement ring
On Janine - just staring Staring and staring

On John - also staring for different reasons Oh you
bastard

And the lift doors roll open

Sherlock steps inside - John is just staring at him Now
dazedly following him

SHERLOCK
You see - as long as there’s
people there’s always a weak spot

JOHN
That was Janine

SHERLOCK
Of course it was Janine She’s
Magnussen’s PA that’s the whole
point

JOHN
- Did you just get engaged to
break into a bloody office

SHERLOCK
Yeah Stroke of luck meeting her

Jesus Sherlock she loves you

As they ascend

JOHN
But it’s Janine What are you going
to do

SHERLOCK

Well not actually marry her
obviously There’s only so far you
can go

JOHN
But what will you tell her

SHERLOCK
I’1l tell her our entire
relationship was a ruse so I could
break into her boss’s office I
imagine she’ll want to stop seeing
me at that point but you’re the
expert on women

JOHN
She’1l be bloody heart-broken

SHERLOCK
Well were splitting up that’s a
perfectly normal reaction

JOHN
Sherlock

SHERLOCK
Stop worrying - once I’m out of the
picture I’1ll be the last thing on
her mind Magnussen is definitely
going to sack her for this

The lift chimes and Sherlock strides happily out of the
lift An appalled John follows a beat later -

CUT TO

INT MAGNUSSEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT 38

They look around Momentarily disconcerted Where is everyone
- so quiet

JOHN

JOHN
Sherlock

John is now racing over to the other side of the room -

- where he can see a single female leg projecting
And there’s Janine lying sprawled
SHERLOCK
Did she faint Is that what they

do

John quickly checking her His hand comes away bloody from
the back of her head

JOHN
Blow to the head She’s breathing
Janine Janine

She mutters mumbles -

SHERLOCK
Look after her -

He’s already leaping over to the other room throws open the
door -

- the Security Officer we saw earlier also sprawled on the
floor -

SHERLOCK
Another one in here - security

JOHN
Does he need help

SHERLOCK
Ex-con white supremacist by his
tattoos so who cares - stick with

Janine

JOHN
Janine can you hear me focus on
my voice

(To Sherlock)
They must still be here

Sherlock has raced over to the chair behind Magnussen’s huge
desk placed his palm on the seat of it

SHERLOCK
So’s Magnussen seat’s still warm -
he should be at dinner but he’s in
the building
(Looks up)
Upstairs

JOHN
He’s the target We should phone
the police

SHERLOCK

During our own burglary You’re not
a natural at this No wait shhh

Big sniff Perfume brand names spin through the air around
him for a moment all evaporating leaving -

SHERLOCK
Claire-De-La-Lune Why do I know
it

JOHN
Mary wears it

SHERLOCK
So does no not Mary there’s

somebody else
His eyes raking round the room details pinging at him -
- then one of the windows the curtains blowing

He steps over pulls the curtain back The window is open a
giddy view over London Someone has climbed in

He looks down the plunging drop the cliff face of glass and
steel

How the hell
A word now floats on the screen
GYMNAST

SHERLOCK
No no no stupid

He’s racing for the stairs again now pounding up them

JOHN
Sherlock

Janine choking and spluttering
JOHN

CUT TO

INT MAGNUSSEN’S SUITE - NIGHT 39

Sherlock now racing into the penthouse suite Huge all of
London blazing at the tall windows

Looking round fast scanning -

- the room mostly in darkness one vivid wedge of light
slashing across the carpet -

- from the bedroom door

- and then a voice Magnussen’s voice But this time
pleading

negotiating for his life

MAGNUSSEN
(From off)
I’m a business man That’s all
Iam

Sherlock now moving to the room swift and precise as a cat

MAGNUSSEN
(From off)
we can do business we don’t
have to be so incontinent

Sherlock now peering round the door

Through the crack in the door Magnussen facing us on his
knees his hands clasped behind his head He’s afraid almost
crying

The muzzle of a handgun with silencer inches from his
forehead

A slim female figure - close-fitting combat fatigues hair
tied up - stands over him gun right in his face

MAGNUSSEN
What would your husband think Your
lovely husband upright and
honourable so English what would
he say to you now

Sherlock now stepping quietly into the room so far
unnoticed

MAGNUSSEN
Youre doing this to protect him
from the truth Is this the
protection he would want
She cocks the gun Finally Sherlock speaks - quiet and calm
SHERLOCK
Additionally if you’re going to
commit murder you might want to
consider changing your perfume
The female figure freezes
- Magnussen’s eyes flick to Sherlock

MAGNUSSEN
Mr Holmes Oh thank God

SHERLOCK
- Lady Smallwood

The figure doesn’t turn

And now Magnussen looking at Sherlock bemused

MAGNUSSEN
What Sorry who

On Sherlock - flicker of a frown of puzzlement
MAGNUSSEN
Oh Don’t you know
(To the woman)
Doesn’t he know
(To Sherlock)
Seriously Lady Smallwood Mycroft
said you were slow but I had no
idea

Sherlocks eyes flick to the woman standing with her back to
him Actually too young to be Lady Smallwood

MAGNUSSEN
That’s not Lady Smallwood Mr
Holmes
And the figure is turning in nightmare slow motion

turning to face Sherlock

On Sherlock’s face The worst moment of his life the most
plunging terrible realisation

Standing facing him gun in her hand is Mary Watson

He stands there He stares He tries to compute - for once
he can’t

Frozen Staring

Mary raising her gun to level right at him

And now a single word in the air in front of her
LIAR

MARY
Is John with you

On Sherlock Still reeling still trying to compute His
first moment ever of total brain-freeze

MARY

Is John here
SHERLOCK

he’s downstairs

MAGNUSSEN

So what do you do now Kill both of

us
SHERLOCK

- Mary Whatever he has on

you -- let me help

Sherlocks eyes flick to Magnussen -

- who’s hand is slowly reaching towards his mobile phone
lying where it fell

Sherlock takes a step
MARY
Sherlock if you take another step
I swear I will kill you right
here
On Sherlock The shock is over he’s back on form

Scanning her fast forensic

Sherlock vision super fast zoom on Mary’s eye Just the
tiniest sparkle of a forming tear

Super fast zoom on the gun trembling in her hand so very
slightly

On Sherlock - the tiniest smile The great detective back in
control

SHERLOCK
No Mrs Watson - you won’t

And he takes a step forward

Without hesitation without a flicker on her face Mary
fires A tiny sneeze of noise from the silenced gun -

- and now a dreadful ringing silence

Sherlock comes to a halt again now just standing there
Frowns as if a thought had occurred to him - a look of the
mildest surprise

Cocks his head as if trying to figure something out

MARY
I’m sorry Sherlock I truly am

Sherlock now looking down at his shirtfront A bloodstain
flowering on his chest

He looks up at Mary total incomprehension His eyes blink
woozily

SHERLOCK
- Mary

Close on his eyes - another big woozy thunderclap blink

Wider - everything is slowly freezing to a stop (We are now
entering Sherlock’s mind palace - the following should be
bold and surreal but fast Action stations in Sherlock’s
brain as he fights to stay alive)

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 0909
39

The lighting changes the walls disappearing into darkness
lights picking out the now frozen figures of Sherlock Mary
and Magnussen

And now impossibly a white-coated Molly Hooper steps
between them just walking casually through - she glances at
Sherlock as she passes talking perfectly conversational

MOLLY
It’s not like it is in the movies -

there’s not a great big spurt of
blood and you go flying backwards

We pan with Molly and in one panning shot the room becomes -

INT BARTS MORTUARY - NIGHT 40

- the mortuary at Barts

MOLLY
The impact isn’t spread over a wide
area it’s tightly focussed so
there’s little or no energy
transfer You stay still and the
bullet pushes through

She’s walked to one of the slabs pulled back the sheet

Sherlock is lying there white and dead a neat bullet wound
in chest

Again close on his eyes the big thunderclap blink
MOLLY
Youre almost certainly going to
die - so we need to focus

She looks at the dead Sherlock’s face and slaps it hard He
splutters awake

MOLLY
Focus

FAST CUT TO

INT MAGNUSSEN’S SUITE - NIGHT 41

Molly now standing in front of Sherlock in Magnussen’s
bedroom all other action is now frozen She slaps him again -

- on the moment of the slap we -

FAST CUT TO

before -

- but this time the impact sends him stumbling out of shot
into -

CUT TO

INT BARTS MORTUARY - NIGHT 43

- Sherlock stumbles against the slab where his own body is
lying Molly’s there too waiting for him

MOLLY

It’s all well and clever having a
mind palace but youve only got
three seconds of consciousness left
to use it So come on what’s going
to kill you

SHERLOCK
The bullet

MOLLY
Why

SHERLOCK
Tissue destruction

MOLLY
No it’s hardly ever tissue
destruction think

SHERLOCK
Blood loss

MOLLY
Exactly So it’s all about one
thing now Forwards or backwards -
we need to decide which way you’re
going to fall

CUT TO
INT MAGNUSSEN’S SUITE - NIGHT 44
- Magnussen’s suite Frozen Sherlock -
- and now Anderson steps into the shot
ANDERSON
One hole or two
The frozen Sherlock turns to look at him
SHERLOCK
I’m sorry

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913
44

Molly now joining them
MOLLY

Is the bullet still inside you or

is there an exit wound That’s

going to depend on the gun
Close on Sherlock surrounded by darkness -
- which now illuminates behind him to reveal a wall covered
in diagrams of guns Sherlock turns to look at it as we

realise we’re now in -

CUT TO

INT FORENSICS OFFICE - NIGHT 45

Sherlock stepping towards a wall covered in diagrams of
different guns Anderson is next to him (The room now seems
real - a remembered place from Sherlock’s past in which he
houses these memories )

Sherlock scanning among the diagrams

SHERLOCK
That one I think Or that one

ANDERSON
Either way it’s a nine millimetre
calibre bullet From a gun that
size factoring in a silencer over
a distance of approximately six
feet

MYCROFT
(From off interrupting)
Oh for God’s sake Sherlock it
doesn’t matter about the gun Don’t
be stupid

Close on Sherlock hearing the familiar voice The darkness
behind illumines to reveal Mycroft at his desk

CUT TO

INT MYCROFT’S OFFICE - NIGHT 46

Sherlock turning to look at his brother

MYCROFT
You always were so stupid - such a
disappointment

Cutting back to Sherlock - but now he’s a little boy snotty
nosed almost crying

LITTLE SHERLOCK
I’m not stupid

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913
46

Mycroft striding round the desk to tower over the little boy

MYCROFT
You are a very stupid little boy
and Mummy and Daddy are very cross -
because it doesn’t matter about the
gun

LITTLE SHERLOCK
Why not

MYCROFT
You saw the whole room when you
entered it - what was directly
behind you when you were murdered

LITTLE SHERLOCK
I’ve not been murdered yet

MYCROFT
Balance of probability little
brother
Little Sherlock starts to turn his head -

CUT TO

INT MAGNUSSEN’S SUITE - NIGHT 47

- now on adult Sherlock turning his head to look at what is
directly behind him -

- a mirror Mycroft is reflected in it

MYCROFT
A mirror exactly If the bullet
had passed through you what would
you have heard

SHERLOCK
The mirror shattering

MYCROFT
You didn’t - therefore

SHERLOCK
The bullet’s still inside me

Molly and Anderson now circling frozen Sherlock appraising
him

ANDERSON
So we need to take him down
backwards

MOLLY
I agree Sherlock you need to fall
on your back

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

47

ANDERSON
Right now the bullet is the cork
in the bottle -

MOLLY
The bullet itself is blocking most
of the blood flow

ANDERSON
But any pressure or impact on the
entrance wound could distort the
primary cavity dislodging the
bullet accelerating blood loss

MOLLY
Plus on your back gravity is
working for us Fall now

The whole room starts to lean Sherlock’s knees start to
buckle - in agonising slow motion he starts to fall
backwards

- and then it’s like every klaxon and alarm is going off at
once His face twists wincing at the terrible noise -

CUT TO

INT BARTS MORTUARY - NIGHT 48

Sherlock stumbles violently against the wall of body
cabinets clutching his head trying to block out the
terrible din -

SHERLOCK
What is that what’s happening

Sherlock’s impact with wall causes one of the long drawers
to slide open -

- inside it is Sherlock himself
Now Molly is there

MOLLY
You’re going into shock It’s the
next thing that’s going to kill
you

SHERLOCK
What do I do

Cutting back to Molly it’s not Molly any more it’s Mycroft

MYCROFT
Don’t go into shock obviously
Must be something in this
ridiculous memory palace that can
calm you down Find it

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

Sherlock on his knees clutching his head too loud too
loud -

At the other end of the long mad corridor a dog - a red
setter It’s terrified cowering

Sherlock clearly recognises it
SHERLOCK
Here boy Come on come to me it’s
okay

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 090913

The dog whines starts cautiously forward The alarms and the
klaxons quieten slightly

Cutting back to Sherlock - he’s the little boy Sherlock now
LITTLE SHERLOCK
Come on Come on it’s all right
it’s me Come here just come here

The dog approaching closer The klaxons and alarms slowly
fading fading

And now the dog is licking Little Sherlock’s face

LITTLE SHERLOCK
That’s it good boy clever boy

Stroking him hugging him And now it’s adult Sherlock again
so pleased so fond

SHERLOCK
Hello again Redbeard They’re
putting me down now Not much fun
is it

CUT TO

INT MAGNUSSEN’S SUITE - NIGHT 53

Now in the same agonising slow motion Sherlock is slamming
down on to the carpet a terrible impact

CUT TO

INT SHERLOCK’S MEMORY PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 54

The dog is gone now as Sherlock convulses and spasms in
pain

The lights in the corridor buzzing flickering

And there’s Molly at the far end of the corridor standing a
few feet in front of a pair of double doors

MOLLY
Without the shock you’re going to
feel the pain

The double doors behind her are starting to burst open
MOLLY
There’s been a hole ripped through
you massive internal bleeding

And now surging through the doors a river of blood in super
slow motion cascading towards Molly to engulf her

MOLLY
You have to control the pain

INT DUNGEON - NIGHT 57

A dungeon like at the very depths of a castle A figure is
chained to the wall hunched hiding his face

SHERLOCK
You never felt pain Why not Why
don’t you feel it

Silence - then a familiar voice from the hunched figure

MORIARTY
You always feel it Sherlock

Jim Moriarty erupts out of the shadows lunging at Sherlock -
the chain yanks him back not long enough

MORIARTY
but you don’t have to fear it

The lights flicker With a gasp and cry Sherlock is on the
floor again

MORIARTY
Pain heartbreak loss death -
it’s all good

Moriarty now looming delightedly over Sherlock who’s in
agony on the floor

MORIARTY
You’re going to love being dead
Sherlock - nobody ever bothers you
Take it from someone who knows - a
bullet through the brain solves
everything

He’s conscious Properly conscious -
he made four deductions and one of
the nurses cry And you Mrs
Watson you’re in a lot of bloody
trouble

He’s joking but it chills Mary

MARY
Really Why

JOHN
You and Sherlock Always thought
there was something going on
between you pair

On Sherlocks eyes flickering open

Blurry details The silent beeping room And irregular
shapes moving slightly in the air-conditioning Monster
shadows on the wall

Sherlock’s eyes blinking focussing

The room is full of flowers And now a figure detaches moves
among them The glitter of gold-rimmed spectacles

MAGNUSSEN
They’re not all from me The
struggling carnations are from
Scotland Yard The single rose is
from W And the black wreath is
from C Block Pentonville - I’m not
sure the intent was entirely
kindly

He settles down in a chair next to the bed

He has taken one of Sherlock’s hands now examines them -
again it’s that terrible assumption of ownership

MAGNUSSEN
I covet your hands Mr Holmes
Look at them though A musician’s
hands an artist’s
(Kisses one of Sherlock’s
fingers)
A woman’s

He shoots a mischievous look at Sherlock - who weak as a
kitten pulls his hand away

MAGNUSSEN
Apologies for the dampness of my
touch - you’1ll get used to it

Sherlock - so drowsy so befuddled - manages to glare at him

MAGNUSSEN

Having shot you the woman you know
as Mary Watson left without
killing me Which is odd because
that was the reason she came

Sherlock mutinous silence A sleepy blink
MAGNUSSEN
I didn’t pass on her identity to
the police - information like that
is too valuable to share
Magnussen’s voice echoing now as Sherlock fades

CUT TO

And now another takes it place this time from the inside of
the paper

HE MADE ME WEAR THE HAT

- over a picture of Janine wearing a deerstalker and
playing the wronged woman for the camera

The newspaper drops revealing Janine’s smiling face

JANINE
I bought a cottage I’ve made a lot
of money out of you mister -
nothing hits the spot like revenge
with profits

Sherlock looks at her blinks considers this Looks at the
tabloids scattered over his bed

SHERLOCK
You didn’t give the story to
Magnussen did you

JANINE
God no One of his rivals he was
spitting Sherlock Holmes you are
a back-stabbing heartless
manipulative bastard

SHERLOCK
And you as it turns out are a
grasping opportunistic publicity-
hungry tabloid whore

JANINE
So we’re good then
SHERLOCK
Of course Where did you buy the
cottage
JANINE
Sussex Downs
SHERLOCK
Nice
JANINE

View of the sea gorgeous There’s
beehives but I’m getting rid of
those

He’s trying to sit up and now gives a big gasp of pain

JANINE
Hurts does it

with the tap

true for you this place They
actually attach the drugs to you

SHERLOCK
Not good for working
JANINE
You won’t be working for a while

Sherl
(A beat - they look at
each other)
You lied to me You lied and lied

SHERLOCK
I needed access to Magnussen’s
office I exploited the fact of our
connection

JANINE
When Just once would have been
nice

SHERLOCK
I was waiting till we were married

JANINE
That was never going to happen I
would never have said yes

She leans in gives him a kiss on the forehead

JANINE

Got to go - I’m not supposed to
keep you talking Also I’m doing
an interview for The One Show and I
haven’t made it up yet

(Turns at door)
Just one thing You shouldn’t have
lied to me I know what sort of man
you are - but we could’ve been
friends

A moment’s silence from Sherlock If he’s capable of shame
this is as near as he gets She turns to go

SHERLOCK
Keep the beehives

JANINE
I’m sorry

SHERLOCK

If you like I’11 teach you about
bee-keeping

cottage and you paid for it
She’s going now Over her shoulder
JANINE
(From off)
Ill give your love to John and
Mary
On Sherlock’s face He likes her Then so suddenly the
warmth just disappears Just drops away in a moment The
cold mask is back
He reaches up with his hand and turns off the morphine again
Close on his eyes as they close -

Close on Sherlock’s eyes as they open -
Wider he’s standing in the corridor of his mind palace

The camera swings giddily round to reveal standing a few
feet in front of him utterly motionless Mary Watson

Words are hanging in the air around her like a swarm
different sizes and fonts -

- but all the same word -

MRS HUDSON
Oh yes He’s put your chair back

better

But John doesn’t think it’s nice at all He’s chilled to the

MRS HUDSON
John What’s wrong tell me John

Closing in on John’s face - staring

An ordinary London street near Paddington station (this is a

On Mary walking along looking at the houses Such a ordinary
street Almost deserted at this time of night

A hotel parked cars nothing
Where does Sherlock Holmes hide here

A homeless man is sitting against the railings as she walks
past

WIGGINS
Spare any change love
(She ignores him)
Oh come on love Don’t be like
everybody else

Mary rolls her eyes - he’s going to be persistent last thing
she wants is to attract attention Tosses some money into his
bowl -

- and to her surprise he immediately grasps her hand presses
something into it -

- when she looks she’s holding a small mobile phone and
Bluetooth earpiece

She looks at him It’s Wiggins
WIGGINS
Rule One of looking for Sherlock
Holmes - he finds you

Wiggins gets up starts heading away

Well no

The phone is already ringing in her hand Only one person it
can be

She slips on the earpiece clicks the phone

MARY
Where are you

SHERLOCK
(VO)
Can’t you see me

MARY
What am I looking for

SHERLOCK
(V0)
The lie The lie of Leinster
Gardens hidden in plain sight

Mary starts moving along the street Looking everywhere

SHERLOCK

(V0)
Hardly anyone notices People live
here for years and never see it
But if you are what I think you
are it will take you less than a
minute The houses Mary - look at
the houses

She’s now walking along the middle of the road looking -
rows of grand terraced houses What is it What is she
missing

MARY
How did you know Id come here

SHERLOCK
(VO)
I knew you’d talk to the people no
one else would bother with

MARY
I thought I was being clever

SHERLOCK
(VO)
Youre always clever Mary I was
relying on that I planted the
information for you to find

Mary has come to halt -

- staring at one of the houses Perfectly ordinary houses -
but clearly Mary doesn’t think so

MARY
Oh

SHERLOCK
(VO)
Forty seconds

MARY
What am I looking at

She staring at the frontage of perfectly ordinary house
Cutting closer on details - the windows are eerily blank
Painted

SHERLOCK
(V0)
23 and 24 Leinster Gardens

On Mary’s back as stares the house The camera now goes
craning up and up from Mary arcing to look down at the
street

23 and 24 are simply a facade - no house behind

SHERLOCK
(VO)
The empty houses

We can see straight down to railway an exposed section of
the London underground

SHERLOCK
(VO)
They were demolished years ago to
make way for the London Underground
- a vent for the old steam trains

Back with Mary staring at this

SHERLOCK
(VO)
Only the very front section of the
house remains It’s a facade
Remind you of anyone Mary A
facade

Now a powerful blazes from the other side of the street -

- and huge smiling picture of Mary’s face is projected all of
the facade of 23 and 24

She stares at this

(VO)
Sorry Never could resist a touch
of drama

She frowns now sees that one of the doors stands slightly
open

SHERLOCK
(V0)
Do come in It’s a little cramped

MARY
Do you own this place

She starts crossing the road towards the door in the her
own smiling face

SHERLOCK
(V0)
I won it in a card game with the
Clarence House cannibal Nearly
cost me my kidneys but fortunately
I had a straight flush Quite a
gambler that woman

CUT TO

INT 23 and 24 LEINSTER GARDENS - NIGHT 90

Inside - a narrow functional structure barely the width of
a corridor In effect it’s the front few feet of a house
sliced off

There’s evidence that Sherlock uses this place Charts on the
wall racks of equipment a spare coat - everything Sherlock
would need in an economy-sized bolt hole

There’s one narrow window - the fierce projector glows
fiercely through it

Back lit by this dimly seen a shadowed seated figure Here
we see the chrome glitter of a wheelchair Above it the
hanging polythene bag of a dripfeed dully catches the light

The figure in the wheelchair is in shadow Maybe looks a
little smaller than usual Hunched as if in pain

A silence They look at each other from the opposite ends of
the empty house

Mary closes the doors Just the two of them now in the
darkness separated by the dazzling shaft

Mary relaxed now strolling around looking at Sherlock’s
various devices and equipment

MARY
What do you want Sherlock

( )

As Sherlock talks Mary looks among the equipment There’s a
rack of forensic tools A first aid kit recently used Keys
on hooks probably various other Sherlock bolt holes

SHERLOCK
Mary Morstan was still born in
October 1974 Her gravestone is in
Chiswick cemetery where five
years ago you acquired her name
and date of birth and thereafter
her identity That’s why you don’t
have friends from before that date

FLASHBACK FROM THE SIGN OF THREE
Sherlock is turning from the wedding planner
SHERLOCK

Your half of the church is looking
a bit bare Mary

MARY
An orphan’s lot All I have are
friends
Back to the present

It’s an old enough technique known

to the kind of people who can

recognise a skip code on sight -

Mary on the back of the motorbike holding up the phone for
Sherlock

FLASHBACK FROM THE SIGN OF THE THREE
Mary racing out the wedding in pursuit of the boys

MARY
You were very slow

SHERLOCK
How good a shot are you

MARY
How badly do you want to find out

From under her coat she takes a gun

SHERLOCK
If I died in here my body would be
found in a building with your face
projected on the front - even
Scotland Yard could get somewhere
with that Anyway you won’t shoot
me

MARY
Shot you once already dear

SHERLOCK

I want to see how good you are Go

on show me The doctor’s wife must

be a little bored by now
She looks at him curious Shrugs Reaches into the little
tray of coins tosses a fifty pence high in the air Almost
casually she shoots
It twangs spins ricochets falls to the floor

SHERLOCK
May I see

She’s already bending to pick it up -

- as the door opens and Sherlock Holmes is framed in the
doorway against the light (He’s paler than normal clearly
weakened by his injuries

He’s extending his hand for the coin

Mary astonished -

( )

EPISODE 3 BY STEVEN MOFFAT - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT - 0909

- She touches her hand to her earpiece realising he was
talking through there the whole time Then looks to the
shadowy motionless figure in the wheelchair

MARY
I suppose that was a fairly obvious
trick

Sherlock coming through the door has plucked the coin from
her hand There’s a hole almost dead centre

SHERLOCK
And yet over a distance of six
feet you failed to make a kill
shot Enough to hospitalise me not
enough to kill me That wasn’t a
miss that was surgery Ill take
the case

MARY
What case

SHERLOCK
Yours Why didn’t you come to me in
the first place

Mary rounds on him fierce now

MARY
Because John can’t ever know that
I’ve lied to him It would break
him and I would lose him forever
And Sherlock I will never let that
happen

She steps closer to him Such cold ferocity in her Whoever
she once was we’re seeing that woman now

MARY
Please understand there is nothing
in this world I would not do to
stop that happening

On Sherlock as cold as we ever see him Just looks at her a
moment appraising

SHERLOCK
Sorry It wasn’t that obvious a
trick
And he reaches over and clicks a light switch

The room illumines -

- and revealed sitting in the wheelchair is John Watson He
was the shadowed figure all along

He is staring at Mary A lost man Tears in his eyes

Now Mary staring at John Oh God Oh God he heard all that

John now unsteadily getting to his feet Just staring at
her staring and staring This woman he thought he knew

Mary nothing she can say Nothing would be enough
A terrible end of the world silence
SHERLOCK

Okay Talk sort it out But do it

quickly - we have a war to win
John and Mary staring at each other
Now slowly fading to black
Holding on the black for a moment Now slowly fading up
Hark the Herald Angels Sing

He returns her smile

SHERLOCK’S FATHER
Aren’t you

On Mary - her smile falters just a little He’s suggesting
they have common ground they’re the sane ones the anchor
points

but for her it’s not true

The door opens Standing there is John Looks serious
slightly embarrassed

JOHN
Sorry I was um

He gestures vaguely at Mary
Mary just looks away Things aren’t good

Mrs Hudson comes flustering from the kitchen
MRS HUDSON
John are you all right Did you

JOHN

Mary now coming through the door Looking so sick like the
world’s end

She just looks over at John who doesn’t look back at her

Mary shakes her head goes to the fireplace Can’t talk

Sherlock I told you shut up

SHERLOCK
No I’m serious everything
Everything you’ve ever done is
what you did

JOHN
One more word Sherlock you will
not need morphine -

SHERLOCK
You’re a doctor who went to war
You’re a man who can’t last one
month in the suburbs without
storming a crack den and beating up
a junkie Your best friend is a
sociopath who solves crimes as an
alternative to getting high -
that’s me by the way hello - and
even the landlady used to run a
drug cartel -

MRS HUDSON
It was my husband’s cartel I was
just typing

SHERLOCK
And “exotic dancing”

MRS HUDSON
Sherlock Holmes if you’ve been
YouTubing -

SHERLOCK
John you are addicted to a certain
lifestyle You are abnormally
attracted to dangerous situations
and people so is it truly a
surprise if the woman you fall in
love with conforms to that pattern

JOHN
She wasn’t supposed to be like
that Why is she like that
On Mary - the pain of hearing this so much

SHERLOCK
Because you chose her

Silence John despairing for a moment lost for words Then
truly lets rip

JOHN
Okay Your way Always your way

He turns crosses to the table takes a chair from it and
then it sets it in place facing the fireplace between

Sherlock’s chair and his own

JOHN

JOHN

Because that’s where they sit the
people who come here with their

John watching uncomfortable Impatiently he pulls a packet
of tissues from his pockets holds them out to her

She gives him a look that says as if
- a flicker of a sardonic smile on Sherlock’s face -

- and Mary pulls the AGRA data stick from her pocket
tosses it on the table

John considers Reaches for the data stick pockets it

MARY
(To Sherlock)
How much do you know already

SHERLOCK
By your skill set you are or
were an intelligence agent Your
accent is currently English but I
suspect you are not You’re on the
run from something and you have
used your skills to disappear
Magnussen knows your secret which
is why you were going to kill him
I’m assuming you befriended Janine
to get close to him

MARY
You can talk

JOHN
Jesus look at the two of you You
should have got married

MARY
The stuff Magnussen has on me I
would go to prison for the rest of
my life I can never be free so
long as he has that information

JOHN
So you were just going to kill him

MARY
People like Magnussen should be
killed That’s why there are people
like me

JOHN

Oh perfect is that what you were
An assassin How could I not see
that

You did see it And you married me

inappropriate exertion and two
packets of cigarettes

MRS HUDSON
Well aren’t you always

However sentiment got the better
of you

Super-fast rewind This time Mary shoots Sherlock in the
chest as before Freeze frame

SHERLOCK
(V0)
A precisely calculated shot to
incapacitate me in the hope it
would give you time to negotiate my
silence

Mary turns to look at a terrified Magnussen

SHERLOCK
(VO)
You couldn’t kill Magnussen on the
night we were breaking into the
building - your own husband would
be a suspect - so

She whacks him hard round the head with her gun

SHERLOCK

(VO
You calculated that Magnussen would
use the fact of your involvement
rather than share the information
with the police since that is his
MO and you left the way you
came

Yes last week but I think I’m

restart my heart on the way

He is staggering to his feet

MYCROFT
I’m glad you’ve given up on the
Magnussen business

SHERLOCK
Are you

MYCROFT
I’m still curious though He’s
hardly your usual kind of puzzle
Why do you hate him

On Sherlock caught out in an emotion

SHERLOCK
He attacks people who are different
and preys on their secrets - why
don’t you

MYCROFT
He never causes too much damage to
anyone of importance he’s far too
intelligent for that He’s a
business man that’s all and
occasionally useful to us A
necessary evil not a dragon for
you to slay

SHERLOCK
A dragon-slayer - is that what you
think of me
MYCROFT
No It’s what you think of
yourself
Sherlock’s Mother pokes her head out the door

SHERLOCK’S MOTHER
Are you two smoking

They have instantly hidden their cigarettes

MYCROFT
MI6é They want to place you back in
Eastern Europe An undercover
assignment that would prove fatal
to you in I think about six

months

SHERLOCK
Then why don’t you want to me take
it

MYCROFT

It’s tempting but on balance you
have more utility closer to home

SHERLOCK
Utility How do I have utility

Mycroft smiles shrugs

MYCROFT
Here be dragons
(Looks irritated at his
cigarette flicks it
away )
This isn’t agreeing with me I’m
going in

SHERLOCK
You need low tar you still smoke
like a beginner
Mycroft is opening the door Hesitates Looks back

Sherlock and John staring at the footage looping on the
wall

SHERLOCK

Yes of course Very hard to find a
pressure point on you Mr Holmes
The drugs thing I never believed
for a moment And anyway you
wouldn’t care if it was exposed
But look how you care about John
Watson Your damsel in distress

JOHN
You put me in a bloody fire for
leverage

MAGNUSSEN
I would never have let you burn
Dr Watson I had people standing
by I’m not a murderer Unlike your
wife

He clicks off the looping footage

MAGNUSSEN

Let me explain how leverage works
Dr Watson For those who
understand these things Mycroft
Holmes is the most powerful man in
the country Well - apart from me
Mycroft’s pressure point is his
junkie detective brother Sherlock
Sherlock’s pressure point is John
Watson his best friend John
Watson’s pressure point is his
wife I own John Watson’s wife I
own Mycroft

something good

SHERLOCK
I think you’ll find the contents of
that laptop -

MAGNUSSEN

- include a GPS locator By now
your brother will have noticed the
theft and the security services
will be converging on this house
Having arrived they will discover
top secret information in my hands

Mycroft in a wood-panelled office talking to some other men
in suits As he speaks he stands staring sadly out of the
window The others are seated listening

The mood is impossibly grave

MYCROFT
Equally it sometimes needs a
dagger A scalpel wielded with
precision and without remorse
(Looks to the others)
There will always come a time when
we need Sherlock Holmes

SIR EDWIN
If this is some expression of
familial sentiment

MYCROFT

Don’t be absurd You know what we
did to our sister In any event
there is no prison in which we
could incarcerate Sherlock Holmes
in without causing a riot ona
daily basis

person at the head of the

table)
The alternative however would
require your approval

On some papers on the table Mycroft’s alternative plan -

Sherlock and John look at each other The end Finally it’s

SHERLOCK
(To everyone)
As this is likely to be the last
conversation John and I ever have

A general muttering of “not at all” “go ahead”

Sherlock and John step to one side

A moment

JOHN
The what

SHERLOCK

A story my brother used to tell me
when I was a kid The East Wind a
terrible force that lays waste to
all in its path It seeks out the
unworthy and plucks them from the
Earth That was generally me

JOHN
Nice
SHERLOCK
He was a rubbish big brother Keep

an eye on Wiggins for me Has the
makings of a detective if he can
be kept off the drugs Think you

could do that

JOHN
I have some form What about you

SHERLOCK

John there’s something I should
say Something I’ve always meant to
say and I never have Since we are
unlikely to meet again I might as
well say it now

(A beat)
Sherlock is actually a girl’s name

JOHN
No it isn’t
SHERLOCK
It was worth a try
JOHN
I’m not naming my daughter after
you
SHERLOCK

I think it would work

JOHN
Shut up

Another silence What the hell to say Finally

SHERLOCK
They were good days weren’t they

JOHN
Yeah they were good They were
very good

SHERLOCK
Baker Street Solving crimes You
and me Don’t ever forget those
days

JOHN
Of course I bloody won’t

Sherlock extends his hand to shake John’s

SHERLOCK
To the very best of times John

John just gives him a look

SHERLOCK
Oh if we must

A proper manly embrace
