A home video of a five year old birthday party where BRYAN
MILLS at 32 and his wife LENORE make a big fuss over their
daughter KIM It seems like the happiest of families
opening presents blowing out candles husband and wife loving
with one another and with their daughter

The video runs to black

The sound of a mans labored breathing replaces the images
A light is switched on and we are in

INT BRYANS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bryan at 48 looking years younger in good shape wakes
suddenly from where he had dozed off on his couch in his
small non descript generically furnished anonymous two
bedroom apartment The instruction manual for a Karaoke
machine he was reading falls to the floor

We realize that this was not a home movie but a dream

Bryan takes a moment to clear his head looks around at his
anonymous surroundings his eyes focus on a picture of a 12
year old girl on a horse in full dressage Kim his daughter
grown up He breathes out heavily his heart hollow He
picks up the manual from the floor looks at it

All is not right in his world It shows in his eyes

Bryan enters to a scene out of Homes of the Rich and Famous
complete with the adult cast of characters

Beyond through the French doors in the vast grounds that
stretch to the ocean a no-expense-spared party is in full
swing An endless buffet attended by a dozen wait staff is
set up under an expansive tent On a dance floor laid over
the lawn teenagers hold sway dancing flirting junior
versions of their parents

Of£ to the side people line up to leave their gifts which
are neatly organized into a small mountain by a maid

Bryan ignores the line when he sees KIM in the back yard
Not the twelve year old in the picture on his desk but a
young woman of seventeen Tall beautiful full of life A
golden girl who carries privilege easily surrounded by
Eriends amidst a swirl of waiters and photographers
videographers

A karaoke machine
The diminishing tone in her voice stings

LENORE

When she was twelve Bryan Weve

moved on

Bemusement mixes with a barely contained disdain

KIM
Thank you Daddy

She hugs him And whispers in his ear
KIM

A bit redeemed Bryan takes out a disposable camera

BRYAN
OK One for the book

LENORE
We have a professional photographer

Bryan ignores Lenores roll of the eyes
BRYAN
Big smile

Kim stands next to the machine flashes a 24 karat smile
And just as Bryan snaps the picture a commotion from the
far side of the property draws her attention to

STUART JAMES rich polished impeccably dressed and coifed
cantering a magnificent specimen of a horse through the gate

The crowd parts and then follows the horse and rider as
they head right for an astonished Kim a delighted Lenore a
chagrined Bryan

Stuart pulls on the reins and comes to an abrupt halt right
in front of Kim Lenore and Bryan He leaps off the horse
hands the reins to Kim

STUART
Happy birthday darling

KIM
Oh my god Oh my god

She throws her arms around his neck peppers him with mad
kisses

KIM
I love you I love you

Bryan winces involuntarily each word each kiss a small
nick on his heart

STUART
Give him a try

Kim puts a foot in the stirrup and with a boost from Stuart
she is in the saddle

Her seat is excellent her command of the huge animal
impressive She jerks the reins the horse responds wheels
around and takes off at a canter across the lawn

LENORE
Stuart you are impossible

STUART
I know Hello Bryan

BRYAN
Stuart

The two men shake hands Stuart with all the confidence of a
man who knows he is ahead on points Bryan with the feeling
that he is losing ground rapidly

Stuart looks over to Kim putting the horse through his paces
on the far side of the vast expanse of lawn

STUART
Shes not a little girl anymore is

Staying for lunch

No I just wanted to come by and
wish her a happy birthday

STUART

grand entrance come mingle

Bryan is lifting her suitcase out of the trunk when Kim
sees

A pretty blonde girl waves to her from inside the terminal

BRYAN
Go ahead I11 bring your bags

Kim goes running into the terminal Bryan watches her go
sees the word DOLLFACE in sequined script across the back of
her jacket It makes him smile

He goes to grab the smaller hand luggage out of the trunk
sees a map in the side pocket Knowing better but not being
able to resist he takes the map out

Bryans POV

A map of Europe with different cities circled in several

countries with dates next to each one He does not like
what he sees

He puts the map back is about to lift the luggage when a
chauffeured Rolls Royce pulls right in front of him He
gives a small grimace

And sure enough the chauffeur opens the door and Lenore
exits

STUART
Charles

Calls to the chauffeur

LENORE
Give Mr Mills a hand

BRYAN

Bryan picks up both bags slams the trunk with his elbow
Lenore heads for the door

tickets weve arranged for her to
stay in good hotels

BRYAN
(pissed)
Good hotels You know you live in
your little bubble here behind your
wall with your chauffeurs and maids
and stylists

He catches himself as his contempt builds

BRYAN
You have no idea what the world is
like Lenore

LENORE
And neither will she unless she goes
out and experiences it And dont
you tell me I do not know what the
world is like For five years I
would wait for a phone call that
didnt come for weeks at a time

(MORE)

LENORE (CONTD)
For a knock on the door telling me
there would be no calls anymore I
became an expert on foreign affairs
I read the paper every day Bryan
Beirut Teheran Bogota Damascus
Looking for a hint a glimmer of
light behind that curtain you pulled
over what you did

BRYAN
I did it to protect you

LENORE
From what Worrying You think not
knowing made me worry less You
think being shut out of your life
protected me

She catches herself checks her anger takes a breath

LENORE

I know we have our issues But Im
going to give you a piece of advice
You moved here to try and build some
sort of relationship with your
daughter Youre not going to do
that by smothering her Let her
live or I promise you youll lose
her

(beat)
And for gods sake dont ruin this
For her

Lenore turns and enters the terminal leaving Bryan to deal
with the bags and the information he cannot act on leaving
him frustrated impotent

containable excitement sparkling in their eyes

Waves to Kim hold his hand up to his ear like a phone Kim
smiles nods waves mouths an ZT love you

disposable camera

And then they run off down the concourse Free
The last thing Bryan sees as Kim disappears in the crowd is

women from the emerging East European

in theyd addict them to drugs and
turn them into prostitutes Lately
theyve found it is more economical
to just kidnap young women traveling
Saves on transportation costs

way these groups operate the analyst

EXT PORTE DE CLICHY - NIGHT

Gregor watches as Bryan speeds away

POV someone else also watching both Bryan and Gregor
ANGLE ON

A figure shrouded in shadows in a car watching through
the windshield

EXT FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

A huge construction project operating twenty four hours a
day seven days a week With all the attendant mountains of
mud and grit and massive earth moving equipment

Tons of earth is moved tons of cement is produced miles of
steel is welded Day and night the work never stops shifts
of men come on others go off But the work never stops

Glant cranes stand like creatures from another planet moving
under the glare of oversized braces of construction lights
Under which a hundred men labor at the backbreaking work of
highway construction

Surreal is the only way to describe the scene

Lining the shadowed perimeter of the site areé rows and rows
of trailers some offices most dormitories long mobile
caravans housing the transitory work force of (mostly)
immigrant laborers

ANGLE ON

Antons SUV Waits outside a very long trailer where thirty
workmen wait ina line to enter A huge Albanian thug stands
guard at the door a card board box next to him

As a man exits the trailer buttoning up his work suit he
hands a plastic card with a number on it to the Albanian
who beckons the next man in the line to step forward The
man hands him money the Albanian hands him the number and
a small towel from the cardboard box The man steps into
the trailer

A moment later Anton comes out jokes with the Huge Albanian
takes a wad of money from him and walks off towards his car

As he passes the line of workers one man close to the front
of the line turns away As Anton enters his car he turns
back It is Bryan In workers clothes Two workers come
out of the trailer

ALBANIAN
Next

Bryan and the man in front of him step up and take a number
and a towel enter the trailer

INT TRAILER - NIGHT

Bryan enters the trailer and what he sees is a long aisle
with five cubicles on either side Long wires with blankets
hanging from them afford dubious privacy to each cubicle
Numbers are pinned to each blanket

Bryan looks at his number Finds the corresponding blanket
goes behind it What he finds is a young girl laying on a
cot with soiled sheets drugged up dulled wearing nothing
but an unbuttoned blouse Half a dozen discarded small towels
fill a small cardboard box in the corner Next to the bed
Bryans eyes go to a bucket with a half dozen used condoms

in it

The girl looks up at Bryan holds a condom up ina lazy
indifferent hand and mechanically spreads her legs Bryan
Fights back his revulsion retreats

Back out in the corridor Bryan collects himself uses all
his will power to keep from throwing up remembers why he is
there goes to the next blanket pulls it aside sees

Another girl laying on a cot naked with dull drugged eyes
and a man just unbuttoning his pants

MAN
Hey

Bryan lets the blanket drop He moves on to the next blanket
pulls it aside to another dazed naked girl laying ona
soiled cot and another man just pulling his pants on using
the towel to wipe himself off

Bryan quickly withdraws

Bryan pulls the next blanket aside a man fucking yet another
girl who just lays there a far away glaze in her eyes
while he pounds away

Out in the corridor again Bryan moves on Pulls the next
blanket finds a man about to mount another of the glazed
over girls whose face he cannot see Is about to withdraw
again when he sees on the floor by the bed a jean jacket
with the word DOLLFACE sequined on the back

FLASH
Bryan sees Kim rushing off with Amanda down the plane
concourse The lights reflecting off the sequined word
DOLLFACE on the back of her jacket
Bryan springs forward grabs the man by the back of his shirt
pulls him off the girl

What the

Before another word can come out of his mouth Bryan has
knocked him out with a sharp blow to the jaw

Bryan turns immediately to the girl expecting to find Kim
but instead finds a complete stranger
64
Bryan lifts the jean jacket to the girls unfocused eyes

BRYAN
Where did you get this

The girl looks at him uncomprehending Bryan sees a series
of fresh needle tracks on her arms Her response is to hold
up a condom spread her legs Bryan takes the soiled sheet
and covers her

BRYAN
Where did you get this

Trying to get her to focus

GIRL
(garbled)
I am good

BRYAN
Who gave it to you

The girl lapses into her drugged state

BRYAN
Who gave this to you

GIRL
I am good

Suddenly the blanket is ripped aside and the Huge Albanian
is standing there Before he can say a word Bryan has lashed
out with a kick that sends him staggering back

The Albanian falls back crashes into the blankets on the
other side of the corridor grasps onto the wire holding the
blankets pulls down the whole row

The men behind the blankets start to yell The naked girls
begin to stir from their dazed states

Bryan gets the girl up grabs her discarded clothes

The Albanian rises from the floor draws a gun from his
jacket is about to fire when Bryan takes the bed sheet and
whips it toward his hand The gun flies from his hand

Men leap from the cubicles pulling on their clothes running
for the exit The girls rise and stagger about lost stoned

The Albanian charges Bryan Bryan side steps and with three
lethal moves puts the man out for good He then turns back
to the girl lifts her from the bed

GIRL
I am good

BRYAN
Yes you are Now come on Im going
to take you someplace safe

Bryan gets the jacket around her She can barely stand

He starts to head for the door shepherding the girl through
the crowd of naked stoned women wobbling around through
the men rushing for the exit When three more Albanians
come charging through the door Seeing the chaos they key
on Bryan and the girl under his arm They attack

Bryan puts the girl aside and meets the first attack
dispatching the man with one chop to the throat he spins
into the second with a palm hand to the nose The third
has drawn his gun fires hits a woman in front of Bryan

As her chest explodes Bryan leaps takes the man out with a
flying kick

INT ANOTHER TRAILER - NIGHT

Anton and three other Albanian thugs are playing cards when
they hear the gunshot

INT TRAILER - NIGHT

Bryan runs back for the girl who has now gone unconscious
He lifts her in his arms heads for the exit

EXT TRAILER - NIGHT

Workers are running off into the night half a dozen stoned
women are wandering about

Bryan hustles the girl out and into the back seat of an

SUV He lays her down straps her in with both sets of seat
belts is about to hop in the front seat when he sees a can
of gasoline by the side of a shed

Bryan tears the sleeve off his construction outfit stuffs

it into the top of the can lights the make shift fuse takes
a running start and flings the can with all his might The
can sails through the air ragfuse leaving a flaming trail
behind The can hits the trailer explodes

The security men the gathered construction workers even
some of the stoned girls Jump as the entire trailer goes up
in flames

A REAL ATTENTION GETTER THAT

Bryan is about to get into the SUV when a shot shatters the
side window He looks up to four very banged up construction
Site SUVss led by Antons unblemished one racing towards
him

Anton hangs out the window fires his gun at Bryan Who
jumps into the SUV takes off

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

The banged up SUVs push past Antons training their
headlights on Bryans vehicle Antons SUV veers off out
of sight

Bryan races across the muddied rutted terrain with the SUVs
racing after him like a pack of predatory jackals One of
the SUVs shoots past the others comes right up on Bryans
rear

Bryan looks in his rear view mirror sees the man in the SUV
pulling a gun

Bryan turns the wheel sharply heads down an impossibly steep
grade spewing gravel and mud

The SUV jumps off the grade follows

Bryans car veers sideways as he struggles to control the
wheel The SUV gains on him Bryan sees the grade bottoming
out spins the wheel so the car is straight As he hits the
bottom he hits the brakes hard Stops abruptly The SUV

so close does not anticipate Smashes right into the rear
of Bryans car The driver flies right through his
windshield shattering both the window and his face

Bryan guns the SUV takes off again because the other two
SUVs have come around the side of the grade and are closing
fast Bryan looks ahead sees up above on a plateau four
Massive earth movers pushing tons of dirt and rock down into
a depression

Bryan races right towards the landslide about to happen
The SUVs race to catch him

Bryan keeps watching the movement up above Slows down just
enough for the SUVs to come closer maneuvers right under
the landslide of earth coming down

The dirt starts to hit his windshield making visibility
precarious He slows even more Checks the SUVs in the
mirror sees the men on them pulling their guns not looking
up just intent on their prey

And then just as the SUVs have Bryan in range a rumbling
distracts them and they see a landslide of earth coming down

Bryan guns his SUV rockets just ahead of the massive slide
driving blind in the cascading debris and dirt

The SUVs caught in the middle of the slide unprotected by
glass and steel are doomed

The first earth hits them blinds them and then buries them

Bryan drives blind but manages to come out the other side
of the slide

Only to see right in front of him bearing down Anton in
his SUV leaning out his window firing his gun

Bryans windshield takes two hits Antons SUV shows no signs
of slowing To avoid the head on collision Bryan veers off
to the left Anton skids hard follows

Bryan races into a series of cranes lifting large steel beams
Anton follows him

Spinning his wheel around the giant cranes and their swinging
loads Bryan kicks up mud and gravel splattering Antons
windshield making it hard for him to see

Bryan sees a load of steel beams being lifted off the ground
swinging left to right He cuts hard around them Tips
them with his front fender The beams spin around fast

Anton barely able to see through the debris and mud
splattering on his windshield does not see the beam end
that crashes through his windshield until it is too late
It crushes his chest

Bryan looks back sees the beam jammed through Antons
windshield looks over at the back seat at the unconscious
girl

Sirens are sounding in the distance Bryan looks up and
sees the flashing lights of police cars approaching He
drives off in the opposite direction

ANGLE ON

A car parked in the shadows The driver watching puts his
car in gear follows Bryan

Good morning

Cleaned up looking very official in a suit enters the yard

ALBANIAN
I help you

BRYAN
Im here to see your boss

ALBANIAN
No boss

Bryan hands him the card he took from Jean-Claude The thug
looks at it Is a bit taken aback

ALBANIAN
We are doing nothing wrong here

Bryan takes out his cell phone has his finger poised over
the keypad

BRYAN
I push one button and thirty agents
will be here before you can scratch
your worthless balls Now stop
fucking around before I shut you
down for wasting my time

ALBANIAN

He enters the house leaving Bryan under the watchful eye of
his cohort Bryan scans the house taking note of the
details windows doors utilities

The first thug reappears

ALBANIAN

BRYAN
Youre holding it

He alludes to the card
INT HOUSE - DAY

Bryan is led down a narrow hallway toward the kitchen On
the way he passes a room where four men are playing cards

He passes a staircase where a man is descending buttoning
his pants another is ascending Bryan looks past the man
descending to the top of the stairs Then he locks eyes
with the man

MAN
(challenging)
What

It is all Bryan can do to reach up and rip his throat out
But he doesnt He moves on

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

The Man who led him in stands by the stove Four other
Albanians sit at a table drinking coffee All have mustaches
all have tattoos of a crescent and a star on their right

hand between the thumb and the forefinger

BRYAN
Black one sugar please

Alludes to the coffee pot One of the men at the table nods
to the thug who brought Bryan in He gets the coffee

MAN 1
What is it you want

He speaks with a lisp

BRYAN
Im here to negotiate the rates

MAN 1
We have already negotiated the rates
with Mr Macon

BRYAN
Mr Macon has moved to another
division I am here for the re
negotiation

The Men say nothing look at each other then back at Bryan
who takes a sip of the coffee

BRYAN

Very nice coffee
(beat)

Unless you think I am being
unreasonable let me explain our
position We have you under satellite
surveillance twenty four hours a
day

The Men all look up to the ceiling out the windows

BRYAN

We hear everything you say we know
everything you do Do you have any
idea what it cost just to change the
angle of the lens on a satellite
orbiting 200 miles above the Earth
And those costs have gone up Our
costs go up your costs go up It
is only logical

(beat)
By the way which one of you is Marko

MAN 2
Why do you want to know

He speaks with a very high voice

BRYAN
I was told Marko is in charge

MAN 1
We are all Marko

BRYAN
Marko from Skopje

MAN 2
We are all from Skopje

BRYAN
If that is the game you want to play
the rate just went up ten percent

MAN 2
If you are trying to make extortion
on us because we are immigrants we
know the law

BRYAN
I am extorting you because you are
breaking the law Now which charge
would you like to be arrested for
The drugs The kidnapping Or the
prostitution

The men look £Erom one to the other

BRYAN
You come to our country take
advantage of our system and think
because we are tolerant we are weak
and helpless Your arrogance offends
me And for that the rate just
went up another ten percent

Again the men trade a look

BRYAN
You want to get down to business
Or you want to keep playing

The atmosphere grows more tense by the moment Bryan stares
at the Albanians the Albanians stare back The thug behind
Bryan has his hand tucked into his coat Then the tension
is broken by

MAN 1
How much

BRYAN
Better Twenty percent

The Man blinks

BRYAN
And you have my word it will not go
up
(beat)
For a year

Bryan goes to scoop sugar in his coffee from a pot on the
table Addresses the third man

BRYAN
How do you say sugar in your language

MAN 3
(Albanian)
sugar

His voice is very deep Bryan repeats the word

MAN 1
And what does the extra twenty percent
buy us

BRYAN

It buys you the future

Again the men look at each other Man 1 pulls out a wad of
bills counts some bills puts them on the table

BRYAN
Youve made a very good investment

He takes the money pockets it finishes his coffee

BRYAN
See you in a month

Gets up to go Then as if forgetting something he takes a
piece of paper out of his pocket the paper he copied words
on from the Albanian dictionary He turns to the fourth
man who has said nothing

BRYAN
A friend gave this to me Its
Albanian You mind translating it
for me

The man stares at the paper suspicious looks at the others
The others shrug He reads from the paper translates

MAN 4

BRYAN
We spoke on the phone three days
ago

Marko doesnt understand

BRYAN
I told you I would find you

Now Marko remembers He reaches into his jacket In the
flash of an eye before he can get his weapon out Bryan
lashes out chops his throat

The other men go for their weapons But Bryan is like
lightning He grabs the two knives from a plate where they
were previously cutting sausage and cheese flings them
simultaneously

One knife catches one man in the heart the other man through
the eye

The third man has his gun out Bryan breaks his neck before
he can get a shot off

Bryan takes the gun Deliberately fires a shot into the
ceiling

Bryan heads out of the kitchen

INT HALLWAY - DAY

The two men from upstairs come running down the stairs run
to the kitchen Find the bodies Hear a noise of feet
running up stairs behind them

INT HALLWAY - DAY

The two men come running back the way they came the footsteps

As they turn the corner to head up the stairs they come
face to face with Bryan stamping his feet on the stairs in
the cadence of someone walking Their momentary surprise is
ail he needs to shoot them dead

Bryan turns and heads up the stairs
INT UPSTAIRS - DAY

Cautiously Bryan comes to a line of closed doors His nerves
keening he moves forward to the first door He opens it
slowly Finds a half naked woman out of it on drugs
handcuffed to a bed

He opens another door Finds another girl in the same
condition

His stomach knotting he opens a third door In the dim
light Bryan cannot make out the face The woman bears a
Similarity to Kim

Bryan hurries over to her turns her head into the light
It is not Kim

Bryan rushes out

INIT BASEMENT - DAY

Light seeps in through the floor boards creating a mix of
light and shadow

Marko is trussed spread eagled naked on a rack that looks
like some sort of SandM sex device Two wires run from his
groin to a light switch on the wall Bryans hand is on the
switch

BRYAN
Where is she

MARKO
Fuck you

Bryan sticks a cloth in Markos mouth his hand hits the
switch A bare bulb goes on flickers with the flow of
current

Marko shrieks into the cloth in absolute agony as current
flows through his gonads

Bryan turns the switch off The room goes back into shadows
and strips of light

BRYAN
(calm)

You know we used to out source this
sort of thing But what we found
was the countries we out sourced to
had unreliable power grids Very
third world Sometimes youd turn
the switch on thered be no power
for hours

(MORE)

BRYAN (CONTD)
And then tempers would get short
people would resort to things like
pulling finger nails acid drips on
bare skin The whole exercise would
becomecounter productive But
here the power is stable theres a
nice even flow Here you can flip a
Switch and the power stays on all
day

He takes the cloth out of Markos mouth

BRYAN
Where is she

MARKO
I dont know

Bryan stuffs the rag back in Markos mouth hits the switch
leaves it on Marko screams in unimaginable agony

Bryan flips the switch off Marko has snot running from his
nose saliva from his mouth

BRYAN

Then at Bryan who glares at them

MAN 1
Gag him

Man 3 takes out a cloth the other two take out knives Man
3 advances on Bryan As he gets within range Bryan pulls
down with all his might on the pipe he is handcuffed to
Snaps it The open pipe spews a blast of steam right into
Man 3s face He staggers back blinded scalded

Steam begins to fill the room Man 2 rushes Bryan leading
with his knife Bryan wraps the handcuffs around his forearm
spins halfway breaks his arm

When from behind Man 1 pulls a garrote tight around Bryans
throat Bryan reverses fast gets his handcuffs around the
mans neck pulls hard snaps his neck like a twig

Man 3 has recovered and charges Bryan with his knife drawn
Bryan reverses him with a swift deflection and drives him
forward right into the dangling steam pipe The pipe plerces
his back and protrudes through his chest blood sprays in
every direction As he dies steam shoots out of the pipe

Bryan reaches over removes a gun from the holster of one of
the dead men shoots the handcuffs off

INT GARAGE - NIGHT
St Clair is waiting for the lift when he hears the shot

ST CLAIR
Would you please go and see which
part of the word quietly they did
not understand

SECURITY
Yes sir

The Security Man heads back toward the rear door when the
door swings open and a burst of steam envelops him Out of
the steam a gun fires blowing a hole in his face

St Clair stares stunned as Bryan emerges from the steam
armed Fire in his eyes

ST CLAIR
(panicked)
We can resolve this

Bryan says nothing keeps advancing St Clair backs up
against the lift door

ST CLAIR
I know how you feel We should talk
Well work it out

The lift door opens St Clair stumbles in tries to push
the button Bryan fires one shot wounding him in his
shoulder St Clair slumps against the wall Bryan stands
over him

ST CLAIR

Bryan puts a bullet in his other shoulder St Clair screams
Bryan aims the gun at his leg

Bryan puts a bullet in his leg

ST CLAIR

The guests are mingling chatting being so pleasantly social
when the lift arrives opens and St Clairs lifeless bloody
body topples out A real party ender

EXT MANSION - NIGHT

Guests are rushing out of the mansion hampering the Security
men trying to rush in

Suddenly

CRASH

One of the luxury cars from the garage comes smashing through
the garage doors to the side of the main building Bryan
behind the wheel

INT CAR - NIGHT

Bryan veers off avoiding hitting the people scurrying around
The Security draw guns try to get a bead on him but Bryan

jerks the car to the left without taking his foot off the
accelerator sending the car crashing through a high hedge

EXT GARDENS - NIGHT

Bryan races the car through the formal gardens of the mansion
destroying a large fountain tearing up the plantings
obliterating several benches and a glass gazebo smashing
through the wall surrounding the whole estate before he
careens onto the road

INT CAR - NIGHT

Bryan emerges onto the top of the Avenue sees in the
distance on the river below a grand boat built in the
Twenties made all of wood and gleaming chrome lit up with
several cars approaching

Bryan hits the accelerator takes a road to the lower qual
EXT BOAT - NIGHT

Ali and his bodyguards bring Kim and two other drugged out
girls onto the boat More bodyguards greet them on deck

EXT SMALL QUAI - NIGHT

Bryan races along the river on the lower roadway sees that
the boat has left the quai and moved out into the river
Bryan screeches to a stop as the road dead ends throws the
Car into reverse goes barreling up the road the way he came

KAT ROADWAY - NIGHT

On the top of the roadway traffic runs in the opposite
direction Out of nowhere Bryans car blows out of the
lower roadway and onto the high quai road AGAINST THE FLOW
OF TRAFFIC

Cars screech bang into each other Bryan sees from his
vantage point that the boat has pulled away from the quai
and is starting to head out into the river

Bryan jams the gear shift into low and takes off after the
boat AGAINST THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC

TRACK WITH Bryan as he races against the traffic keeping
one eye on the boat cruising in the middle of the river and
the other eye on the cars trying to get out of his way as he
barrels full speed right at them

Cars careen left and right slamming into each other running
up on the shoulders of the road taking out lampposts guard
rails

Bryan pulls even with the boat still racing headlong into
the traffic Oblivious to the mayhem he is causing he looks
over toward the boat see several crewmen on deck but no
sign of Ali or Kim

INT BOAT - NIGHT

Ali enters a stateroom where an older man in Traditional
robes SHEIKH RAHMAN is reclining on a huge bed

ALI

(Arabic)
They are being prepared sir

INT CAR - NIGHT

Bryan races down the road until he comes to a bridge ahead
of the boat He brakes hard gets out and starts running
to the center of the bridge

He perches right at the rail waiting for the boat to come
closer

On the quai road the sound of police sirens and the sight

of flashing lights heading right towards him draws Bryans
attention for a moment

INT BOAT - NIGHT

Ali walking along a corridor hears the noise outside peers
out a window sees the police cars rushing up the quai thinks
nothing of it heads for a door at the end of the hall

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

Bryan watches the boat passing underneath the bridge some
thirty fee below He takes a breath jumps

INT ROOM - NIGHT

Ali watches as two Arabic women are dressing Kim and the two
other spaced out girls in very chic but very revealing gowns

ALI
Show time

And then he hears a loud thump on the deck above

EXT BOAT - NIGHT

Bryan has hit the deck hard injuring his ankle Taking a
moment to collect himself he looks up to see three crewmen
running towards him two have clubs the third a shovel
Bryan manages to find his feet just as they attack

The first man swings his club Bryan disarms him crippling
him with a blow to the throat He raises the club just as

the shovel comes crashing down blocking the sharp edge of
it and driving the club into the mans jaw in one swift move

The third man catches him with the club across the back
Bryan buckles a bit from the blow The man is about to land
another when Bryan kicks out from the floor shattering the
mans knee

The man goes down screaming in pain Bryan puts him out of
his misery with a reverse elbow strike to the face

INT BOAT - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Ali moves through the corridor the three dazed girls being
hustled along by two other men when he sees through the
narrow window above him a man hitting the deck blood
spurting from his mouth

ALL
You

He motions to one man

ALI
Come with me

Motions to the other

ALI
You deliver the girls

Ali and one of the men run off
EXT BOAT - NIGHT

Bryan makes his way along the deck favoring his injured
ankle when suddenly a door opens behind him and two men
rush out one with an ax the other with a machete

Bryan grabs the only weapon available the oar from a life
boat

Bryan battles both men skillfully using the oar to deflect
the blows from the ax and the machete spinning feinting
blocking striking until the man with the machete snaps the
Oar in two with one downward cut

Just then the man with the ax swings at Bryan Bryan blocks
the blow with one end of the oar jams the jagged other end
into his chest In one swift circular move Bryan grabs the
ax Spins and buries the blade into the chest of the machete
wielder

Bryan hears a noise behind him turns just as two more men
emerge firing guns Bryan pulls the man he just axed in
Front of him The bullets riddle his body

Bryan spins with the corpse grabbing the machete swinging
down at the shooters hands Chops one mans hand clean
off Severs the second shooters throat
99

Another man emerges from the cabin spraying with an
automatic Bryan pushes the corpse into him clambers up
and over the cabin roof

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DECK

Bryan drops back down onto the deck his ankle crumbling
underneath him He rises painfully only to find another
three crew armed with clubs and knives charging

The first man attacks with a knife Bryan lets the knife
pass inches from his side then spins the man and drives the
knife into the second man who is charging right behind him

The third man swings down with his club catches Bryan on
the shoulder sends him staggering almost over the side of
the boat

The Clubber swings again Bryan rolls over the rail latches
onto a rope attached to the side uses the rope to block the
next blow He wraps the rope around the mans wrist and
pulls The man flies over the rail into the river

Bryan clambers back onto the deck barely has time to catch
his breath when a bullet smashes into the wall next to his
head He turns to the two gunmen and Ali coming over the
top of the roof With nowhere to run he dives through the
window leading inside the boat

INT BOAT - NIGHT

Bryan lands in the interior corridor just as two more men
come around the corner with automatic weapons

They fire Bryan yanks open a door which takes the barrage
of bullets

When the smoke clears there is no movement from behind the
door The men rush the door swing it open There is no
one there

The men run forward turn the corner right into two grappling
hooks that embed in their chests Each hook held in one of
Bryans hands

Bryan sees a door at the far end of the corridor grabs one
of the automatic weapons from the men he just dispatched
heads towards the door as fast as his bum ankle will carry
him

Suddenly from outside on the deck gunfire shatters the
windows rakes the corridor tearing the wooden walls

Bryan runs returns the fire through the windows as he goes

One man outside falls another falls Then Bryan takes a
bullet in the arm loses his weapon as he hits the floor
10Q

Bryan struggles up his arm bleeding pulls himself up on
the shredded wood of the wall when Ali drops down the stairs
pistol in hand

ALI
You

He raises his pistol to fire Bryans hand clutching the
wooden wall yanks a board free and just as Ali fires he
dives forward somersaults and comes up right in front of
Ali buries the board in his hand in Alis forehead The

exposed nails pierce Alis brain

Alis eyes stare into Bryans go lifeless Bryan pushes

him aside ignores his own wound picks up Alis pistol and
limps for the door at the end of the hall

Just as he approaches the door a shot rings out from inside
pierces the door Bryan falls

The door opens and Sheikh Rahman appears pistol in hand
Behind him Kim and the other girls are huddled on the bed

Rahman stands over Bryan regards him for a moment then
turns back to the room He hears a noise Turns again to
Bryan standing bloodied

BRYAN
Partys over

Rahman raises his pistol Not as fast as Bryan Bryan drills
one shot right through Rahmans forehead Rahman falls to
the floor dead

Bryan steps into the room sees Kim on the bed She looks
at him with glazed drugged eyes He goes to her

BRYAN
Kim

She looks up at him uncomprehending at first then

KIM
Daddy

Her eyes light with recognition

KIM
You came for me

She starts to cry

KIM
You came for me

She wraps her arms around him sobs
BRYAN

He holds her close
