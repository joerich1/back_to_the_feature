July 19 1978

FADE IN
1 EXT SPACE (S) 1

An ever expanding infinity of light and color as CAMERA

TRAVELS THROUGH deep space MOVING DIRECTLY for one
pinpoint of light a STAR GROWING RAPIDLY as we SWEEP
TOWARD IT a normal white star SUDDENLY CHANGING
brightening flaring unbelievable intensity supernova
The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment then MOVES on SEARCH-
ING through space the jeweled beauty of other star
systems sparkling nebulae swirling hydrogen clouds
STILL MOVING then CAMERA FINDS

2 EXT AREA OF LUMINESCENCE (S) 2

In the far distance slowly growing in size as CAMERA
APPROACHES it resembles vaguely at this distance an
Aurora Borealis flaring colors from the fringes
beautiful yet ominous It is so large this Cloud it
can envelope an entire solar system CAMERA CONTINUES
APPROACHING the Cloud and then suddenly crossing

our POV a

3 KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S) 3

In a graceful turning arc toward the mysterious
LUMINESCENCE CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon then FINDS

a second Klingon cruiser also turning toward the Cloud
which continues to grow in size as the Klingons
approach at warp speed CAMERA CLOSING on the lead

ship until the vessels detail can be clearly MADE

OUT lights weaponry power systems identification
emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon
language (and symbols)

4 INT KLINGON CRUISER BRIDGE 4

Clearly alien an ODD-SOUNDING KLAXON signaling
battle stations Orders issued in KLINGON LANGUAGE
the KLINGON CAPTAIN and EXEC peering at an unusual
bridge viewer at the huge area of LUMINESCENT HAZE
directly ahead In KLINGON DIALOGUE

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(Give me tactical)

CLOSE - MAIN VIEWER goes suddenly to a TACTICAL GRID SYSTEM showing the
LUMINESCENT HAZE to be an ENORMOUS BLIP OF LIGHT ON
THE SCREEN with two TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT complete-
ing their turn on a direct course toward it

EXT SPACE - THE KLINGON PATROL AND THE HAZE (S)

The Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the
bottom of the FRAME THREE tiny ships closing on the
steadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE

INT THE KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC All eyes on the viewer that shows the ships sweeping
on the Mysterious cloud

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
Visual
The TECHNICIAN makes the switch

CLOSE - VIEW SCREEN - LUMINESCENT HAZE growing ever larger its flaring colors menacing
mysterious strangely beckoning

INT BRIDGE - KLINGON COMMAND CRUISER
The crew stands by for battle
KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
Tactical again Stand by on
torpedoes

EAT SPACE - LEAD KLINGON VESSEL (TORPEDO HATCH) (S)

sliding open the glowing Hell Fire of the Photon
Launch tubes slowly revealed

VERY WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE SHIPS (S)

They are tiny insect-like shapes moving still CLOSER

to the Luminescent Cloud so large now that it begins
to dominate all space behind

INT KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID - CAPTAIN AND
EXEC The growing nearness and enormous size of the Cloud
also reflected on the Tactical Grid somehow more
awesome by this schematic view The Captain gestures
the order to FIRE

EXT SPACE - ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL - TORPEDO HATCH (S)

The BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from
the tubes

ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL (S)

A deadly PHOTON TORPEDO pattern racing away from the
Klingon and toward the Luminescent glow in the distance

INT KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID Three torpedoes are heading directly toward the Cloud
Suddenly they glow briefly and disappear long before
they reach their intended target

INT KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC

incredulous that their torpedoes have disappeared
without a trace

EXT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THREE KLINGON SHIPS (S)

as the second and third ships launch torpedoes toward
the color-flaring surface of the cloud This time we
have an outside real VIEW of the torpedoes glowing
brightly and then disappearing with no effect

INT KLINGON BRIDGE The Klingon crew grim desperate watching a BRIGHT
STACCATO BLIP OF POWER from within the LUMINESCENCE

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(quickly Klingonese)
Full force fields evasive
maneuvers

EAT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THE KLINGON PATROLS (S)

Out of the LUMINESCENCE hurtles a FRIGHTENING WHIPLASH
OF ENERGY It bears down on the Klingon Patrol now

in an evasive maneuver Then the WHIPLASH BOLT hits
the third cruiser in a writhing flare of energy which
totally engulfs the vessel

The other two ships veer off warping around again into
attack position The THIRD SHIP has begun to implode

in on itself the matter-energy of its existence
drained by the WHIPLASH BOLT that HOLDS IT

ANGLE ON REMAINING KLINGON CRUISERS (S)

desperately defending themselves FORCE FIELDS FULL UP
RAPIDLY FIRING PHOTON TORPEDOES But now a SECOND
WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT has emerged from the cloud and
hits the second vessel DESTROYING it

The THIRD WHIPLASH BOLT glances off the surviving
Cruiser as the ship retreats in a wide evasive turn
FIRING from stern tubes

INT KLINGON BRIDGE

The bridge shattered Klingon bodies The mortally-
wounded Captain is transmitting urgently

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
severely damaged Returning
fire

EXT SPACE - STARFLEET MONITOR STATION EPSILON 9 (S)

Serenity here A barren rocky small plantoid softly
lit by the myriad stars This is a small Starfleet
outpost antennae sprouting everywhere Tiny figures
(WORKERS) servicing one antenna illustrate the size
of the installation

INT EPSILON 9 - MONITOR ROOM - A VIEWER SHOWING the battle scene and the VOICE OF THE KLINGON
CAPTAIN in his last stand against the Object his VOICE
is weary almost mechanical On the adjacent viewer

an English printout of the Klingons words chatters
along the bottom of the picture

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar
severely damaged by unfamiliar
weaponry intruder unidentified

WIDER ANGLE - EPSILON 9 STARFLEET PERSONNEL AND VIEWER At the viewers are a FEMALE LIEUTENANT and FOUR TECH-
NICIANS COMMANDER BRANCH a young alert enters hur-
riedly scans he console

LIEUTENANT
Our sensor drone is intercepting
this on Quad L-14

KLINGON CAPTAIN (VO)

to be enormous power field
surrounding alien vessel
size and description unknown
our sensor scans unable to
penetrate Imperial Klingon
Cruiser Amar continuing

BRANCH
Thats within Klingon boundaries
Who are they fighting

LIEUTENANT
Unknown sir

A violent EXPLOSION inside the Klingon bridge -- Klingon
Captains body is thrown violently against the bulkhead

TECHNICIAN
I have an exterior visual

CLOSE ON VIEWER showing EXTERIOR of the Klingon vessel a final
frightening WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT strikes it -- then
the same awesome IMPLOSION INTO FIREBALL

WIDER ANGLE - PERSONNEL AND VIEWER The Starfleet station onlookers react to the utter
annihilation of the huge cruiser And now past where
the cruiser just disappeared -- the mysterious LUMINES-
CENCE approaching in distance Technician hits a
switch magnifying the strange CLOUD

LIEUTENANT
Weve plotted a course on that
cloud Commander it will pass
into Federation Space fairly
close to us

BRANCH
Heading

CLOSE ON THE MAIN MONITOR STATION as its focal point shifts to the huge elliptically-
shaped LUMINESCENCE racing across the sky MUSIC
(VGER THEME) COMMENCES in a low unresolved CHORD
that remains in the background through the remainder
of this scene and the beginning of the next one

LIEUTENANTS VOICE
Sir its on a precise heading

for Earth

Ominously now the LUMINESCENCE increases in size and
begins to fill the viewer HOLD A MOMENT and then

EXT SURFACE OF PLANET VULCAN - DAY (M) 28

with the CAMERA MOVING THROUGH masses of thick steamy
vaporous clouds swirling about rising boilingly up
from some unseen underground source The CAMERA
CONTINUES MOVING through clouds

And then the Vulcan landscape Harsh strange
angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren legend-
ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters

EXT VULCAN LEDGE - SPOCK ( M and FP) 29

Spocks lean features instantly recognizable despite
unkempt longer hair and the fatigue born of a long
harsh discipline he has undergone His robes tattered
and dust covered are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in
study with the Masters Under the Vger THEME MUSIC

we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones

FEMALE MASTERS VOICE
Spock son of Sarek of Vulcan
and of Amanda of Earth
diligently you have labored for
purification of mind

REVERSE ANGLE - SPOCK VULCAN MASTERS AND RUINS 30

In bg gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins In fg
the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle
of three similar platforms On them in regal robes are three
VULCAN MASTERS The Master in the center is a female the
other two Masters are male The elderly female is holding a
cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around

Spocks neck at an appropriate moment Spock is staring up
as Vger THEME MUSIC fades

MALE MASTER
(chidingly)
Spock

Spock turns giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual
continues

FEMALE MASTER
Here are these sands our fore-
bearers cast out their animal
passions Here our race was
saved by the first attainment of
Kolinahr

MALE MASTER
Kolinahr the final shedding of
all emotion

FEMALE MASTER
You have labored long Spock
Now receive from us this symbol
of total logic

Spock starts to kneel the Female Master moves in
intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck
But Spock now hesitates -- hes troubled as though

uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the
pendant away Then a faint reprise of the Vger THEME
MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward
She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a
look with the Male Masters

FEMALE MASTER
(gestures Spock forward)
Come give me your thoughts

She kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples
in Vulcan mind-meld position

FEMALE MASTER
(continuing)
Our minds Spock One and
together

Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head
jerks slightly her features change as her mind feels
Spocks reactions to the Vger consciousness A long
moment then she opens her eyes gets to her feet and
looks down on the still kneeling Spock Then she
casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into
the dust

FEMALE MASTER

(continuing sadly)
This consciousness which calls --
it stirs your human half Spock
You have not achieved Kolinahr --
Your human emotions are not fully
extinguished

(turns to the other Masters
He will not achieve his goal with
us His answer lies elsewhere

The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go his
disappointment evident even in his stoic features

MED ANGLE ON SPOCK (M and FP)

CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag-
ment of Vger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his

head and peers up into the heavens HOLD on his face
a moment then

SHOCK CUT TO
EXT EARTH - AN AIR TRAM - DAY (S)

gleaming silver in the sun as it streaks TOWARD THE
CAMERA POSITION and hurtles PAST

EXT SAN FRANCISCO - HILLTOP AIR TRAM STATION -
DAY (M)

From this vantage we can SEE all of twenty-third
century San Francisco stretched out before us In

the bg the familiar forms of the carefully preserved

Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building
serve as our only reminders that this is indeed San
Francisco

The AIR TRAM (an anti-gravitational train flying
several feet above the ground) DECELERATES sharply
settles to the ground with a whisper

EXT TRAM STATION - CLOSE ON TRAM DOORS - DAY

The doors opening and various TRAVELERS (civilians
and Starfleet personnel) leaving the tram striding
onto the platform continuing on their respective
ways Among the departing throng

KIRK

in Admirals uniform grim determined moving through
the throng Now and then Starfleet officers nod re-
spectfully KIRK responds with detached formality his
mind is clearly set on something he is resolved to ac-
complish here in headquarters -- whatever the cost
CAMERA WITH HIM to

INT AIR TRAM STATION - DAY

as Kirk strides into the graceful Starfleet HQ building

Many PEOPLE are about civilians and uniformed person-
nel most of them with some air of urgency (NOTE
ALIENS interspersed among them Vulcans blue-skinned
Andorians high-domed Vegans ect) Kirk continues on
when suddenly he reacts annoyed as he sees

SONAK

a Vulcan Lt Commander short white-haired grizzled
hurrying along Kirk calls to him

KIRK
Commander Sonak

SONAK turns with Vulcan imperturbability to face Kirk
who steps toward him

KIRK
(continuing)
Youve received your appointment
as Enterprise Science Officer

SONAK
(nods)
Based I am told on your
recommendation Admiral Thank
you

KIRK
Why arent you on board

SONAK
Captain Decker requested I complete
final Science briefing here before

KIRK
(interrupting)
Here at Starfleet The
Enterprise is in final preparation
to leave dock

SONAK
Which will require twenty more
hours at minimum Admiral

KIRK
Twelve Im on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura which will not
last more than three minutes
Report to me on the Enterprise in
one hour

SONAK
To you sir

KIRK
I intend to be there following
that meeting Report to me One
hour

And Kirk turns strides purposefully away Sonak gazes
after him one eyebrow raised quizzically

EXT EARTH ORBIT (S) 38

In fg Orbital drydock offices rotating slowly but
perceptibly against blue-black of space Small figures
in spacesuits working on construction with work belts
Beyond and below Earth In the far distance we can
barely make out an orbital drydock

40A

CLOSER ANGLE - ORBITAL OFFICE CLUSTER (S)

The cluster is a fully-equipped dockyard engineering
center and computer drafting office

CAMERA MOVES IN AND CENTERS ON an outer Travel Pod
INT INNER OFFICE an installation which also includes a double position
transporter in which we SEE the TRANSPORTER EFFECT
BEGIN With the TRANSPORTER CREW IS SCOTT Hes with
a Technician busy with a piece of complex circuitry
Then he turns sees that it is Kirk BEAMING in here
As Kirk materializes steps off the transporter plat-
form Scott moves quickly to him

KIRK AND SCOTT

The starship Engineering Officer clearly surprised to
see Kirk here Kirk has the same look of grim de-
termination we just saw in the headquarters building

SscoTT
Admiral Ive been hoping to see
you Maybe you can get through
to those thick heads in Starfleet
that

KIRK
Why arent the Enterprise
transporters in operation Mister
Scott

SscoTT
Were hoping its only a temporary
problem Admiral

KIRK
See that it is
(moving toward pod)
Take me over please

Scott is now eying Kirk just a little warily as he fol-
lows him into the pod Kirks determined expression
suggests that some chips are going to fly and Scott
does not want to become one of them

SscoTT
(carefully)
Admiral the Enterprise has just
finished eighteen months redesign-
ing and refitting She needs
testing a shakedown

KIRK
Mr Scott theres an alien object

40A
40c

with unbelievable destructive
power less than three days away
from this planet

Kirk hits a button on the travel pod panel -- the air-
lock doors SLAM closed behind them Then stepping im-
mediately to the front observation window

KIRK
(continuing)

the only Starship in
interception range is the
Enterprise Ready or not she
launches in twelve hours

Scott throws Kirk an appalled look but is now occupied
in sealing the Outer Pod door and manipulating drive
controls

CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL front of the
Pod and arms of the office complex as Pod disconnects
and starts to move

EXT POD

CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL front of the
pod and arms of the office complex as Pod disconnects
and starts moving

EXT EARTH ORBIT - ANGLES ON TRAVEL POD (S)

as it moves way from the office complex We can
SEE the jet flames of its tiny thrusters as it cir-
cles around heads off (toward the distant Orbital
dry dock)

INT TRAVEL POD - KIRK AND SCOTT

Scott nervously eying Kirk and finally deciding to
make one more effort

SscoTT
The crew hasnt had near enough
transition time with all the new
equipment And the engines
Admiral theyve yet to be even
tested at warp power Add to
that an untried Captain

KIRK
(hint of smile)
Two and a half years as Chief of
Starfleet Operations may have
made me a little stale Mr Scott
-- but I wouldnt exactly consider

40c

myself ‘untried

It takes Scott a moment to comprehend and Kirk smiles
now nods

KIRK
(continuing)
They gave her back to me Scotty

Scott peers at him genuinely surprised -- and pleased
Then

SscoTT

Gave her back sir I doubt
it was that easy

(returns smile)
But any man who could manage such
a feat I wouldna dare disappoint
Shell launch on time sir

(with confidence)
And shell be ready

And he clasps Kirks elbow affectionately then gestures
Kirk to look out the pod window

EXT OUTSIDE THE POD WINDOW - KIRKS POV as he looks out the blue-black of orbital space
INT TRAVEL POD

Scott is well aware of what the Enterprise means to
Kirk As Scott maneuvers the pod to provide the best
perspective Kirk peers through the observation window
craning his head hungry for his first glimpse of the
starship Scott is watching him immensely pleased

PAST THEM TO THE POD WINDOW as we SEE the drydock and more of its detail anda
hint of what is inside

EXT EARTH ORBIT - OTHER ANGLES FROM THE POD PAST Kirk and Scott the corner of the drydock becomes
larger -- we begin SEEING more of it And then the
merest glimpse of what is inside the drydock The
Enterprise slips INTO VIEW

INT POD - VERY CLOSE ON KIRK AT WINDOW

as he watches his face reflecting all of it the awe
the wonder the romance the obsession The one comp-

lete love of his life And with that love regained
he is becoming more fully alive again

Kirk looks at Scott for a moment both hold each others

eye Scott knows precisely how Kirk feels Both turn
to the window again

WHAT THEY SEE - THE ENTERPRISE (S)

Now DOMINATING the SCREEN -- the awesome symmetrical
bulk of the starship comes fully INTO VIEW And it
dominates Kirks -- and our emotions

EXT THE ENTERPRISE - AND THE POD (TINY IN THIS SHOT)
AS IT CIRCLES - THE ANTI-LIKE FIGURES OF WORKERS (S)

The great ship dwarfs everything The drydock becomes
a fragile filigree framing the ships great curved
bulk The tiny pod continues to move along it

Small automated welding devices move along the gird-
ers working with brief bright orange-white flares
In other areas of metal lace structure supplies and
equipment are being loaded onto the ship The pod

continues moving (Scott is giving Kirk time to see all)

watched carefully by the TINY FIGURES OF SUPERVISING
TECHNICIANS on the drydock Now the pod moves toward
mating position It closes in secures itself to the
outer airlock

INT POD - AT THE AIRLOCK

Scott completing the mating procedure Kirk turning
from the observation window Outside the metallic
CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock Now the
WHOOSH of the latch doors securing the CLANG of
security bolts Its all been a rare and delicious
moment for Kirk and his face shows it

OVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR Pod secured Pressure
equalized Scott moves the control to open the hatch

INT ENTERPRISE CARGO DECK (M)

A confusion of organized work and VOICES The cargo
deck bustles with activity supplies and equipment
being stored and installed

INT CARGO DECK - BALCONY AND CATWALK

Kirk and Scott are met by a nervous perspiring
ENSIGN

KIRK AND SCOTT
Permission to come aboard sir

ENSIGN
Granted sir Welcome aboard
Admiral Commander Scott
youre needed in Engineering
immediately

SscoTT
(to Kirk)
Sir youll excuse me

Kirk gestures him to leave and Scott hurries away
Kirk stands a moment gazing down at the cargo deck

ANGLE DOWN PAST KIRK TO FLOOR (M)

The crew maneuvering antigravity devices which move
heavy containers -- scrambles of activity at storage
holds and maintenance lockers

CLOSE ON KIRK AND ENSIGN
Kirk is drinking it all in Hes home

ENSIGN
(nervous)
Sir if youll follow me Ill

KIRK
I think I can find my way
Ensign

And Kirk moves off leaving the Ensign gazing at him
relieved

EXT ELEVATOR AND CATWALK
Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open
INT ELEVATOR

as Kirk enters The doors close Kirk waits a beat
savoring this moment too Then firmly to the control
panel

KIRK
Bridge

The turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur-
tling up On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic
diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevators
speedy trip to the Bridge

INT BRIDGE
A confusion of activity and VOICES Pieces o equip-

ment in a state of disarray consoles open fiber
optic tubes unconnected viewing screens dismantled

Its a frantic desperate scene -- a ship and crew to-
tally unprepared In the midst of this ALIEN

ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt Comdr stripes)deftly
working her communications station AD LIBBING

Hailing frequency four check Hailing frequency
five will someone please check me At the helm
sweat-soaked SULU (Lt Comdr stripes) has a service
plate open is peering inside to make delicate adjust-
ments AD LIBBING Helm now give me a reading on
four point zero zero six of full And at the Weapons
Control CHEKOV (Full Lt)argues with TECHNICIANS who
insist photon torpedoes read ready while Chekov
argues the computer is not relaying that information

ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS

snapping open -- and there is Kirk For the moment no
one notices him and he stands watching remembering
And then he moves forward toward the command center

ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK

as she is the first to see him She reactspleased

UHURA
Captain Starfleet just
signaled your transfer-of-
command orders

ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION
as everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk

All work stops with various AD LIBBED greetings from
the old crew Admiral Kirk Its the Captain
etc etc But most sit or stand simple gaping at
Kirk all quite awed The old hands Uhura Sulu and
Chekov start converging on Kirk But he gestures them
back speaking crisply

KIRK

I appreciate the welcome I wish
the circumstances were less
critical

(to Uhura)
Epsilon Nine is monitoring the
intruder keep a channel open to
them

(glances around)
Where is Captain Decker

SULU
Hes in Engineering sir
(uncomfortable
indicates Captains
chair)
He doesnt know

Kirk reacts with some exasperation starts away
addresses Chekov

KIRK
Mr Chekov assemble the crew on
the Rec Deck at 0400 hours I
want to show them what were
facing

And Kirk moves to the elevator enters is gone The
moment the elevator doors snap closed

SULU
I wouldnt have wanted to have
been standing in his way He
wanted her back he got her

ALIEN ENSIGN
(perturbed)
And Captain Decker Hes been
with the ship every minute of
her refitting

UHURA
(brittle)
Ensign -- our chances of coming
back from this mission in one
piece may have just doubled

INT ENGINEERING SECTION

The entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity
ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female)
coming and going the platform-elevators (small one-
man lifts to various levels) busy A gentle but con-
stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core to indi-
cate a pre-idling mode There will be continual AD
LIBBED conversation among the Technicians

Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the
area He stands a moment observing the activity a
grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on
an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful watch
it sir admonishment Kirk moves on to

THE INTERMIX CHAMBER

at the middle of the power shaft Very NOISY here
and a continual CACOPHONY of COMPUTERIZED AND HUMAN
VOICES calling off equipment checks And grouped
around a section of burnt-out circuitry are WILLARD
DECKER Captains stripes handsome in his early

30s Scott and two Technicians Decker and Scott

are working feverishly uncoupling the device

probing its innards Decker has discovered the problem
removed several transistor-type parts taps them

with a pencil-sized sonic analyzer

DECKER
(quietly elated)
I thought so See the trans-

porter sensor was not activated

SscoTT
(impressed)
Aye you were dead right about
that
(to Technician)
Clearly put a back-up sensor into
the unit

72 ACROSS THEM TO KIRK 72

as the Technician prepares to install the device
Scott glances up to see Kirk

He looks from Decker to Kirk in acute embarrassment
(so that we should realize Scott hasnt mentioned
Kirks taking over to Decker) Decker now notices
Kirk reacts pleased

DECKER

Admiral Kirk

(shakes Kirks hand)
Were getting a top brass send
off

(self assured grin)
Shell launch on schedule if we
have to tow her out with our bare
hands Right Scotty

SCOTTY
(lamely)
Aye sir that we will

KIRK
(to Decker)
Will lets go over here and
talk

He indicates corner Decker glances bemusedly at
Kirk then turns to Scott

DECKER
Let me now when the back-up is

in place

73 ACROSS SCOTT TO KIRK AND DECKER 73

as Scott AD LIBS a glum Aye sir and watches them
walk across the Chamber

A CORNER OF THE INTERMIX CHAMBER

just a little quieter here with Kirk and Decker arriv-
ing and Decker saying blithely

DECKER

All due respect sir I hope
this isnt a Starfleet pep talk
Im just too busy

Kirk eyes Decker -- then decides the best way to say
it is plainly directly

KIRK
Im taking over the Center seat
Im sorry Will

DECKER
You are what

KIRK
Im replacing you as Captain of
the Enterprise

Decker seems shocked into silence he can only peer
at Kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a
paternal hand on Deckers shoulder then withdraws it
and continues quickly

KIRK
(continuing)
Youll stay aboard as Executive
Officer a temporary grade

reduction to Commander

DECKER
(finding his voice)
-- You personally are assuming
command

KIRK
Yes

DECKER
May I ask Why

KIRK
(nods)
My experience -- five years out
there dealing with unknowns like
this -- my familiarity with the
Enterprise this crew

DECKER

Admiral this is an almost totally
new enterprise You dont know
her a tenth as well as I do

ANOTHER ANGLE - TO SHOW SCOTT IN BG (ACROSS THE
ROOM)

Scott working on the relay but continually glancing

at Kirk and Decker with worried concern as Kirk
replies

KIRK
Thats why youre staying aboard
Im sorry Will

DECKER
No Admiral I dont think you are
not one damned bit I remember
when you recommended me for this
command You told me how envious
you were and if only you could
find a way to get a starship
command again Well sir it looks
like you found a way

Kirk is silent a moment peering levelly at Decker
who returns the gaze with equal intensity Then

KIRK
Report to the bridge Commander
Immediately

Decker EXITS Kirk waits collecting his composure
as he watches him go Then Kirk turns to glare at
Scott Interrupted by a flare as something shorts
out at the mechanism where Scott and Decker had been
working Technician (Clearly) reacts hits an inter-
com button fast

TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
Transporter room come in
Urgent

(to Scott)

Redline on the transporters
Mister Scott

Scott whirls to a console fast speaks urgently

SscoTT
Transporter room do not engage
Do not

TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
(reacting to the reading
interruption)

Too late theyre beaming now

Kirk is exiting on a run followed by Scott

INT TRANSPORTER ROOM - INCLUDING TRANSPORTER CHAMBER

An unusually defective looking TRANSPORTER EFFECT in
progress alternately flashing and glowing -- even the
Transporter SOUND seems wrong as if struggling to
overcome some problem At the console CHIEF RAND and
ASSISTANT are reacting in surprised near-horror as
they attempt vainly to save the situation

RAND
(into intercom)
Starfleet override us
OVERRIDE Yank them back

Suddenly from Rands consolea VIOLENT GLARE -- a
PROTESTING SOUND from the circuitry And on the con-
sole a red-warning light now begins flashing

STARFLEET VOICE
Unable to retrieve their pattern
Enterprise

Rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to
FAINTLY MATERIALIZE then FADE AWAY then REAPPEAR IN
FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con-
trols Kirk ENTERS fast steps to the console to
assist Rand Scott has also come in and moves to the
console brushes aside the Asst Chief and begins
manipulating the additional controls himself

SscoTT
Were losing the pattern

KIRK
(into intercom)
Starfleet boost your matter gain
we need more signal

RAND
Oh no Theyre forming

CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER with the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER
MATERIALIZATION FRIGHTENINGLY HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN We

RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan Sonak -- the other a
human WOMAN They MATERIALIZE we HEAR A MOAN form
from the Vulcan -- the Womans SCREAM OF PAIN Then

all at once the half-materialized bodies are gone
the transporter chamber is empty

KIRK
Oh my God

KIRK SCOTT AND RAND 78
gazing horrified at the empty chamber

KIRK
(into intercom)
Starfleet do you have them

A mutter of utter vacant silence -- and Kirk and
Scott look at each other again their pained faces
presaging the answer they already know

STARFLEET VOICE
(shaken)
Enterprise what we got back
didnt live long Fortunately

Another moment of stunned silence and then Kirk hits
the transmission button -- fighting to control his
voice as

KIRK

Starfleet Kirk Please
express my condolences to their
families Commander Sonaks
can be reached through the Vulcan
Embassy

(see Rands stricken

expression)
There was nothing you could have
done Rand It wasnt your fault

And before Rand can answer Kirk leaves the room
INT CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK 719

as Kirk steps out and the doors snap closed behind
him In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar-
ture is as everywhere quite evident CREW MEMBERS
move back and forth But Kirk does not see them his
mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was
there something he should have done could have done
to prevent it Should he launch on schedule with the
starship this unready Has he done right in yielding
to this terrible needs for starship command again
forcing Starfleet to give her to him Would Deckers
knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci-
dent

Kirk reaches a corridor intersection looks around
realizes hes lost track of where he is A passing

YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression

KIRK
Turboshaft eight

YEOMAN

Shes
came

Back that way sir

indicating back the direction from which Kirk
He nods his thanks turns and moves back down

the corridor

DECKER

hurrying down the corridor The two face each other
a silent moment Decker studying Kirk curiously

KIRK
Well have to replace Commander
Sonak Id still like a Vulcan
there if possible

DECKER
None available Captain Theres
no one in fact whos fully rated
on this design

KIRK
You are Mister Decker Im
afraid youll have to double as
Science Officer

And Kirk moves on Decker stands gazing reflectively
after him

87 INT RECREATION DECK (M) 87

We SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW
MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck

The Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on
the ship several deck levels high a part of one
wall consisting of picture windows through which can
be seen sections of the drydock structure outside

On another wall is a large viewer on which was just
shown the Klingon transmission Leading off and away
from this deck area are what are obviously other
specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums food centers
game rooms lounges etc

88 ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL 88

as the Crew Members chat in low grim tones -- Kirk
(now with Captains stripes) appears As he comes
into view the two hundred or so crew below go silent
Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer

KIRK
Thats all we know about it
except that its now 22 days
from Earth Enterprise is the
only Federation starship that
stands in its way

ON THE REC DECK VIEWER as all eyes turn to the viewer which fades into a view
of Commander Branch in the Epsilon 9 monitor room
Branch is tense reflecting extreme urgency Near
Branch working intently at the console are the Female
Lieutenant and a Technician

BRANCH

Receiving an odd pattern now
(toward Branch)

They seem to be reacting to
our scans sir

mistaking our scans as a
hostile act

ON THE VIEWER - EXT THE DESTRUCTION OF EPSILON 9 as the image of Branch is immediately replaced by an
external view of the plantoid and the LUMINESCENT
CLOUD (at about the same distance from which the
Klingon cruisers were attacked)

Then it STRIKES the plantoid WITH FULL CATACLYSMIC
FORCE The viewer IMAGE BREAKS UP -- and immediately
the entire Starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of FLAR-
ING ENERGY shattered structure flying debris And
then all at once there is nothing -- empty space
Epsilon 9 is gone We SEE only the stars and the
mysterious LUMINESCENT CLOUD moving across the distant
sky

finished not a word is spoken)

stops -- nothing he can say will add at all to what
theyve just seen Instead

The last is interrupted by
ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS 98A

as they snap open and there emerges a breathtakingly
beautiful young woman (uniformed as a Navigator Lieu-

tenant) who strides purposefully onto the bridge A
stunning figure but hairless entirely bald but or
delicate eyebrows and eyelashes Her bald head is not
at all unattractive in fact exudes an aura of sensual
nudity Indeed her whole being exudes sensuality
(This is a racial characteristic not a deliberate
presence) She approaches Kirk

(NOTE Throughout this sequence Sulu eyes ILIA with
unrestrained admiration)

ILIA
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for
duty sir

KIRK

(formally rising)
Welcome aboard Lieutenant

ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER

as Ilia starts to speak suddenly stops she has just
then noticed Decker who has stepped from his station
to face her For an electronic moment their eyes meet
hold in unquestioned recognition

DECKER
Hello Ilia
ILIA
(surprised)

Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern
(it presages possible complications) Decker turns to
Kirk slightly uncomfortable at this

DECKER
I was stationed on the Lieutenants
home planet some years ago

Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker puzzled at his
sleeve stripes

ILIA
(eyes his rank
stripes)
Commander Decker

KIRK
Our Exec and Science Officer

DECKER
(bitingly)
Captain Kirk has the utmost
confidence in me

Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker then toward
Ilia too

KIRK
(pointedly)
And in you too Lieutenant

ILIA
My oath of celibacy is on record
Captain May I assume my duties

While respectful her tone of voice has been just as
firm as Kirks

KIRK
By all means

ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA 100
receiving a message now relaying it

UHURA
Captain Starfleet reports our
last six crew members ready to
beam up
(puzzled)
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter

Just as Kirk a moment before was tense now suddenly
hes relaxed again he rises

KIRK
(pleased)
Oh Ill see that he beams up

And he hurries from the bridge onto the elevator is
gone A moment of puzzled silence then

DECKER
Mr Sulu take Lieutenant Ilia
in hand
SULU

(then understands)
Yes of course

(to Ilia)
Your pre-programming is already
set in Lieutenant

Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair He
starts offering Ilia his hand then thinks better of
it withdraws it abruptly immediately busies himself
punching out equations on her console AD LIBS

Its all on the computer Youll have no problem

Sulu is nervous
now hits a wrong switch

fluttery around this lovely creature --
Produces a BEEPING SOUND which

he fumbles to shut off She smiles speaks quietly

repeats

Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply

ILIA
Im sworn to celibacy Mister
Sulu That makes me as safe
as any human female

moved in beside Ilia

Clearly

DECKER
I now the Captain meant no person-
al insult

invoked a little known -- and
seldom used -- reserve activation

Sir the Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power by
channeling it through the main
engines When they went into

phasers were automatically cut
off

that And when this mission is
over you have no intention of
giving her back

sees Spock at the science console -- she moves in
quickly overjoyed Even McCoy seems pleased

CHAPEL

McCOY
So help me Im actually
pleased to see you

But as Chapel crosses to Spock her pleased smile
brightening her whole face Spock turns dismisses her
presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel
stops stands dumbfounded Spock gives McCoy a similar
glance - turns back to his console readings as

UHURA
Thats how we all feel Mister

The same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid-

sentence Several grins directed toward Spock are now
fading from bridge crew faces Spock has turned back
again for a last quick reading at the console and now
stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks
coolly unemotionally to Kirk

SPOCK
With your permission I will now
discuss these fuel equations with
the Engineer

Kirk manages a nod a bit dumbfounded himself at Spocks

strange manner Spock heads for the elevator -- puz-
zled expressions from the entire bridge crew Then
Kirk calls after him very sincerely

KIRK
Mister Spock welcome aboard

Spock continues onto the elevator without any acknow-
ledgment leaves Kirk glances perplexed at McCoy
McCoy equally perplexed shrugs

Sit down please

Spock remains standing addresses Kirk

SPOCK
Sir I would appreciate Dr McCoy
absenting himself from this
interview

KIRK
I want him here
(indicating)
Sit down

For an instant it looks like Spock will refuse Then
he complies but sits formally rigidly He ignores
McCoy totally

KIRK
Youve reported that you felt
strong thought emotions A
group of minds from a space
vessel Could you make out any
plan anything to do with
Earth

SPOCK
(still formally)
Negative Captain I could sense
only what seemed an almost
omniscient pattern of perfect
logic I can explain nothing
more I understand nothing more

Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable
about what he must ask next He exchanges a glance
with McCoy then

KIRK
Also -- there was nothing in your
report about why youre here

SPOCK
That inquiry invades my personal
life Captain

McCOY
Spock weve already guessed why
youre here

KIRK
I inquired about you -- learned
you were studying with the

Masters

Although Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless
his expression shifts slightly McCoy indicates this

McCOY
That flicker of emotion confirms
our guess You failed

SPOCK
(facing McCoy for
the first time)
Your deductions do you credit
Doctor if your puerile
curiosity does not

McCOY
(not in amusement)
And now anger Spock

Spock looks straight ahead -- his face instantly com-
posed to almost total blankness

SPOCK
(beat nods)
I still contain fragments of my
human half

KIRK
And whatever you sensed out here

SPOCK
is my only hope of accomplishing
what the Masters could not

McCOY
If you achieve perfect logic Spock
youll pay a price Its given
your planet ten thousand years of
peace but no poetrys been written
since then no music

Spock has come to his feet fast - but Kirk is on his
feet too confronting him During which

void relieved only by strange flickering glows of dis-
tant ENERGY FIELD PATTERNS

The crew reacts with understandable awe apprehension
curiosity as

strike directly at the beam might
weaken it just enough for us to

point convincingly

to Deckers reaction and begins walking about the Rec

switches it on -- presses button to activate its

In what way is the life form in

Carbon units are not true life

forms Do those images repre-
sent how Enterprise has evolved

DECKER
(hoping hes struck
a responsive chord)
Yes

ILIA
Carbon units have clearly retarded
Enterprises proper evolvement

What is Enterprises proper
evolvement

Enterprise should not require
the presence of carbon units

And with this she moves off observing other Rec Deck
objects Decker moves with her then

DECKER

is necessary before carbon units can
be patterned for data storage

then dropping down into a deep trough-like area
which stretches into the distance ahead of him A
cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS (Kirks entrapment) become
visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis-
tance and does not attract them

We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall
of the trough toward which Spock is heading It is an
unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem
to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance
(Here also we will become aware of sensor-bee
swarms intermittently darting toward this same wall
from all points of the chamber)

Sulu hits the viewer magnification control
294 ANGLE TO MAIN VIEWER (M) 294

As the distant STROBE FLASHES of Kirks spacesuit are

MAGNIFIED CLOSER pulling Kirk into MEDIUM LONG SHOT

We can SEE the details of the swarm of forms adhering
But we can SEE that Kirks spacesuit is now about half
covered with them

Expressions of bridge crew to reflect the horror of
what theyre seeing as

Spocks spacesuited figure MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA
as we HEAR

KIRKS VOICE
(weak STATIC)
- Spock need help
trapped

No indication at first that Spock has heard his face
set with determination his eyes fixed on his destin-
ation the inner wall

KIRKS VOICE
(continuing weakening

STATIC)
pressure on me cant
move Spock
ON SPOCK - CLOSE 296
as Kirks VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now

is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously Spocks
expression flickers then he hits reverse thruster
JETS stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall
then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the
way he came from But he cannot resist Kirks call
he suddenly hits his thruster controls then JETS

INT VGER - SPOCK AND KIRK 301

facing each other while hovering in space

KIRK
Bridge cancel rescue teams
(hard)
Spock what in the hell are you
doing out here

SPOCK
I am seeking answers Captain

KIRK
(with insight)
Answers to what Spock Our
dilemma -- or your personal one

Spock does not immediately reply peers at Kirk through
the faceplate a long beat then abruptly looks away
points off into the distance

ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING INNER WALL We can SEE what appear to be SPARKLING GLOBULES OF
LIGHT darting toward the inner wall in the distance
then disappearing there (Well SEE other swarms
occasionally too coming from different directions --
they will later be identified as sensor swarms on
closer examination)

SPOCK
(pointing)
Captain I believe there we will
find an indication of whoever --
or whatever -- is aboard this
vessel

Kirk weighs alternatives then pushes his thruster
controls and begins moving in the direction Spock
indicated

Their thruster jets flash propel them toward the
point on the inner wall

INT VGER - AT INNER WALL

The most prominent area of the vast inner wall -- the
patterns on the wall here seem to GLOW with life

The spacesuited figures of Kirk and Spock ENTER SCENE
gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central
part of theses patterns

CLOSER ON KIRK AND SPOCK

as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE
THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops motionless
Then Spock sees something indicates

LONG ANGLE TO INCLUDE SENSOR SWARM Now we SEE that they are tiny multi-colored points
of FLASHING LIGHT -- almost like swarms of bees
They approach the inner wall at this central point
and seem to disappear through the orifice

KIRK AND SPOCK - ANOTHER SWARM APPROACHING 306

This sensor swarm has been coming from a direction
that will take them close past Kirk and Spock Then
as it passes Spock reaches out quickly grabs
He turns to Kirk his hand closed on something

CLOSE ON KIRK AND SPOCK (AGAINST TUBE WALL) 307

Spock opens his hand retaining a hold on something
with his fingers He brings it up to Kirks face mask
-- its a tiny SENSOR its multi-colors flashing as it
tries to escape from Spocks fingers And in this CLOSE
VIEW we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the
one weve seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probes
throat hollow Then Spock releases it and it darts

to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner
wall

KIRK AND SPOCKS POV 308
From this closer distance we SEE that an opening ap-

pears in the wall admits the sensor swarm then closes
immediately

BACK TO SHOT 309

Kirk and Spock exchange a look Their thruster JETS
ignite briefly moving them in that direction

INT VGER - KIRK AND SPOCK 310

closely approaching the inner wall now timing their
movements to coincide with the arrival of another
swarm -- the wall begins OPENING The swarm
through the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and
Kirk slip in before it closes

INT MEMORY CAVE - SPOCK AND KIRK 311

The wall closing behind them they are safely inside
But as they stop their forward momentum their eyes
widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing

311A WHAT THEY SEE (M)

311A

The long cave chamber with its row of huge MEDIATOR
BALLS extending into the distance To one side the
gleaming CRYSTAL MEMORY WALL
311B

311c

RAPID

pattern

311B KIRK AND SPOCK

as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what
they are seeing Then he takes out his tricorder
again propels himself toward the memory crystals
Kirk follows

311¢ AT MEMORY CRYSTAL

as Spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings

SPOCK
It would appear that the atomic
arrays of these crystals store
information A remarkably
efficient system

KIRK
(indicates)
And these sensor-swarms collect
that data carry it here

SPOCK
(nods indicates)
New crystals they must contain
the most recent data obtained --

And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be
shinier more pulsating than the others) ANOTHER

PROFUSION OF FAINT IMAGES but this time including a
pattern-like image of Klingons Klingon vessels (the
ones destroyed by the Cloud) and obvious Starfleet
personnel -- and the Epsilon 9 station Also a

of the Security Guard killed by the probe And Ilia

KIRK
Klingons our Epsilon 9 station
and Ilia They seem to be
more than just images

SPOCK
(agreeing)
Exact patterns The energy bolt
that hit them wasnt simply a
weapon -- it dematerialized them
stored them But why

And he turns and begins moving on studying the wall
consulting his tricorder

ACROSS THEM TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE WALL

Spock inspecting this area at which the newer crystals
are PULSATING and GLOWING and which appears to be a
termination of the Crystal area continuing on and dis-
appearing through the wall

KIRK
If this is their ships data
banks where is the crew Or
is their entire ship automated

SPOCK
Captain I do not believe there
is a crew -- or that this is a

vessel as such

A beat as Kirk reacts incredulously

SPOCK
(continuing)
I am almost certain now that all
of this is Vger -- I believe

that we are inside a life form
a living machine

Spock turns his spacesuit turns his tricorder out to-
ward the Mediator Balls takes a reading in that di-
rection Then a glance to Kirk

SPOCK
I must attempt mindmeld with it
Captain

Spock touches his spacesuit controls the THRUSTER
JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls

KIRK
(warningly)
Spock

ANGLE AT MEDIATOR BALL

Spock reaching the Ball halts his momentum and removes
one gauntlet baring his hand Stretching the bare
hand toward a part of it which looks strangely alive
The very power generated from this area is clearly
affecting Spocks hand Meanwhile Kirk has used his
THRUSTERS to join him

KIRK
Spock if youre right its mind
may be enormous

But Spock pays him no attention his entire being now
focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the alive area --
the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock as he forces his
hand toward that surface closer closer

KIRK

watching almost mesmerized Torn between wanting to
pull Spock away from the wall -- and knowing that
Spock must go through with it For everyones sake

CLOSER ON SPOCK

preparing for the ordeal moving his hand to the liv-

ing area the invisible force even stronger -- but
Spocks strength unwavering and now he touches the
surface -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the

touch And at the same moment Spock body convulses
as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are
charging through him

CLOSE ON SPOCKS FACE

as he begins to shudder with the shock the CAMERA
CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spocks mouth
open -- he SCREAMS CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF
SPOCKS EYES

CAMERA ZOOM - THROUGH SPOCKS EYES

MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES
(per Con Pederson discussion) Symbolizing Vgers
incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge
these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms molecules
galaxies dimensions of the universe beyond human
knowledge or comprehension It takes only fifteen or
twenty seconds but seems to span aeons taking us
through micro-infinity and macro-infinity

DISSOLVE TO
INT DISPENSARY - SPOCKS EYES

CAMERA BRIDGING BACK OUT THROUGH SPOCKS EYES AND INTO
ANGLE ON SPOCKS FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed His
eyes are open he is staring straight ahead as if ina
catatonic state completly unaware of his surroundings
Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE moving a medical
scanner over the brain area

CHAPEL
Now scanning pons area at spinal
nerve fiber connection

ANGLE ON McCOY AND KIRK

McCoy at a console watching readings he is getting
from Chapels scanner Kirk watches McCoy anxiously

McCOY
Indications of some neurological

trauma--the power pouring through
that mind-meld must have been
staggering

Before Kirk can reply they HEAR a LAUGH An abrupt
harsh bitter laugh

ACROSS THEM TO SICKBAY 320

as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously
Spock who has just laughed -- but there is no indication
of laughter from him now A startled Chapel has stepped
back away from the bed Spock seems to be attempting

to focus orient himself as Kirk and McCoy hurry to the
bedside

SPOCK
(quiet)
Jim

And Spock reaches out a hand weakly takes a surprised
Kirks hand in his McCoy exchanges a surprised glance

with Kirk as Spock -- clutching Kirks hand in friend-
ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak
SPOCK
(continuing)

This simple feeling
(looks at Kirk
is so far beyond Vgers
comprehension

ANOTHER ANGLE 321

with Kirk and McCoy exchanging another surprised
glance (at Spocks emotion) with McCoy gesturing Kirk
not to question it

KIRK
(gently)
Were you right Spock Vger
is a living machine

SPOCK
(nodding)
A life form of its own a
conscious living entity

CHAPEL
(reacting)
A living machine

McCOY
(to Chapel)
Were living machines too protein
mechanisms

Kirk nods at McCoy

KIRK
And it considers the Enterprise
living machine thats why the
probe refers to our ship as an
entity

CHAPEL
If it thinks our ship is alive
what does it think we are

322 ANOTHER ANGLE

as Spock turns to Kirk

Kirk waits for Spock to continue
weak

But Spock falls back

McCOY
(dryly)
An infestation -- bacteria
microbes
SPOCK

I saw Vgers planet a planet

populated by living machines

Unbelievable technology
(pained)

Vger has knowledge that spans this

universe

And in all this order all

this magnificence Vger feels

no aweno delight no beaut
(a beat exhausted)

I should have known

KIRK
Know what Spock What

tugs at Kirk AD-LIBBING Let him rest
Kirk shrugs McCoy away addresses Spock

ye

but Spock seems too

exhausted -- and McCoy gently

Jim

KIRK
(continuing)
What should you have known

SPOCK
(weak)
No meaning No hope
(summoning strength)
And Jim no answers
Jim its looking for answers
itself

KIRK

then

What answers

SPOCK
Is this all I am Is there not
more

Just then an INTERCOM SIGNAL

UHURAS VOICE
A faint signal from Starfleet
sir Intruder Cloud has been
located on their outer monitors
for past twenty-seven minutes
dissipating rapidly as it approaches

Immediately Sulus voice

SULUS VOICE
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed We
are three minutes from Earths

KIRK
(into intercom)
Ill be right there
(to Chapel crisp)
I need Spock on the bridge

ANOTHER ANGLE

as Chapel urns to a MED TECH AD LIBS an order

Dalaphaline twenty ccs As the Tech quickly sets

the hypo-injector and hands it to Chapel - and she

injects Spock the hypo emitting a fast QUIET HISS --

Kirk gazes at Spock just an instant as Spock breathes

deeply

and the Tech help Spock from the bed

McCoy

the drug clearly strengthening him Chapel

KIRK
A machine planet Sending a
machine to Earth looking for its
Creator

McCOY

Kirk looks at him then at Spock -- on his feet now --
at McCoy again

KIRK
To find the Creator the probe
said Find God

Isnt that what were all trying

as Kirk addresses

The probe bland as usual
have strangely elated Decker he says to her

to do

Kirk stands facing him another moment then whirls
and steps to the monitor flips some buttons
peaks into his communicator

and

I want to make a ships announcement

But its to be heard only in
Engineering

UHURAS VOICE

KIRK
(voice amplified)
This is the Captain speaking It
appears that the alien ship
Viger is NOT a manned vessel

SHOWING Scott (at his console) listening to Kirks
words -- and facing Decker and Ilia who are just
about to leave Engineering

disapproval

SscoTT
Well sir now what about all that
A living entity the Captain says

Decker really hasnt heard Scott hes gazing at Ilia
attempting to digest what shes just said But quickly

DECKER
Thank you Scotty

He moves to leave

SscoTT
(dourly)
Your welcome sir

Now Decker and Ilia move toward the exit Scott gaz-
ing after them glaringly watching Ilias every
move Suddenly almost into the corridor Ilia turns
and looks back at the engine room She addresses
Decker but load enough for Scott to overhear

ILIA

There is no logical reason for
carbon units to control Enterprises

Kirk with McCoy and Spock who although somewhat shaky
is clearly more alert They are just assuming their
stations

UHURA
Were now locked into Starfleets
transceivers Admiral Nogura has
received your reports sir

328 ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER 328
Kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer

on which is appearing an IMAGE of Vger looming omi-
nously in orbit over Earth

UHURA
The visual is a lunar monitor
relay sir

As they begin to study it the IMAGE suddenly distorts and
is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES

RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN

(Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference
some-times seen on the television screen)

UHURA
(continuing)
Heavy interference sir -- its
coming from here inside the
intruder itself

Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we
HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS Spock looks up from
his console listens to it

SPOCK
Puzzling The interference
appears to be a rather simple
carrier wave code signal

UHURA
On an old style radio frequency
sir
329 PAST KIRK TO THE ELEVATOR 329

as the doors snap open and Decker and Ilia appear
All eyes go to them as

TILIA
(to Decker
interrupting)

As I stated Vger calls to the

Creator

DECKER

(nods turns to Kirk)
Vger is announcing that it has
arrived sir -- that its ready

Kirk hears this

to deliver the information it
was programmed to collect

ILIA
To learn all that is learnable

DECKER
(to Kirk)
It expects a return signal now
ordering it to transmit that
information to the Creator

UHURA
(whirling)
Sir Vgers signals have
stopped
ILIA
(as if frightened)
Decker The Creator has not
responded

Uhura interrupts

UHURA
Picking up Starfleet again a
lunar monitor relay

ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER turning inquiringly toward her

but

as indeed the interference is fading and a new Main
Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows VGER IN EARTH
ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from
Vger It is an ominous looking HUGE SWIRLING GREEN

MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts
that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very
nearly the Enterprise It is not a bolt now -- the mass

is much larger and appears much more deadly A second
object has now formed and moves off a third one begins
to appear (Meanwhile the first and second PLASMA-
ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in
different direction)

My God

McCOY
Theyre the same kind

of things that destroyed the
Klingons Epsilon Nine

SPOCK
(interrupting from
science console)

These read as identical composition

(turns to Kirk)

however Captain they measure
several hundred times more
powerful

KIRK
High mag Mr Sulu

Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI-
FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES
more clearly

SULU
The third one is moving off too --
a fourth one is forming

UHURA
(overlapping)
Urgent signal from Starfleet
Captain
(turns shaken)
All Earth defense systems have
gone dead

Kirk reacts hard at this Uhura gets another message

UHURA
(continuing)
Sir Starfleet computes their
trajectories as moving toward
equidistant positions over Earth

331 ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK 331
exchanging significant glances
SPOCK
From four equidistant positions

Captain a detonation would blanket
the entire surface of the planet

DIFALCO
I plot them as reaching equidistant
positions in twenty-nine
minutes sir mark
332 ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER AND ILIA 332

as Kirk vaults from his chair strides to a handrail to
confront the Ilia-probe

KIRK

ILIA
The carbon-units infection will
now be removed from the Creators
planet

KIRK
Why

ILIA
The Creator has not answered

KIRK
The carbon-units are not
responsible for that

ILIA

You infest and control Enterprise
Vger believes carbon-units interfere
with the Creator in the same manner

SPOCK
(to Kirk)
Then Vger believes the Creator to
be a machine too

DECKER
(nods)
It seems we all imagine God in our
own image

ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER - INCLUDING CHEKOV 333

Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have
all moved away from Vger now in different directions
growing smaller in the distance The fourth object is
holding position nearby seeming to grow in size and
intensity

ANGLE EMPHASIZING KIRK 334

as he throws a look toward Spock who is now in deep
meditation Kirk turns and takes Ilias shoulders
and carefully turns her to face him

McCOY
Similar life forms
Jim Vgers saying the Creator
is a machine

DECKER
(grimly amused)
Of course we all create God
in our own image

Kirk peers at Decker a moment ingesting this thought
Then he addresses Ilia again this time with emotion
after all he is pleading for the survival of the
entire planet

KIRK
Viger If we are lesser beings
we are still like you living
And because we are alive we --
like you -- wish to survive

Kirk pauses abruptly

stonily --

You must not destroy --

not the slightest reaction or response

clearly Kirks plea is being ignored
Kirk draws in his breath to continue realizes the

futility

turns helplessly to Spock

ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK

who has been listening intently

-- an idea forming in his mind Quickly he steps
down to Kirk

FAVORING

startled

SPOCK
(quiet terse)
Captain
(reaches Kirk)
Treat Vger as you would a

KIRK

at this not sure hes heard correctly

KIRK
Child
SPOCK
Yes Captain a child evolving
into adulthood -- learning searching

-- instinctively needing

DECKER
(intrigued)
Needing what

McCOY
Spock this child is about
to eliminate all life on Earth
how do we teach it that thats
wrong With a spanking

Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly then replies to

Decker

Kirk says

is racing

SPOCK
It doesnt know what it needs
Comm ander
(to Kirk)

It does not know
nothing looks at Spock who is awaiting a
then Kirk glances at Ilia -- his brain

struggling to reach a decision And then

KIRK

Tlia is regarding him blandly

with near fascination

(abruptly to

Tlia)
The carbon--units-know-why-the
Creator-has-not-responded

McCOY
(shocked)
Jim

DECKER
(to Ilia
urgingly)
Ilia we can help Vger
find what it needs --

Tlia studies Decker just a bland beat then turns
to Kirk

ILIA
(to Kirk hard)
Disclose the information

KIRK
(cool calm)
Not until Vger withdraws the
devices orbiting the third planet

TILIA
KIRK UNIT DISCLOSE THE
INFORMATION

Kirk studies her a moment then decides to press his
bet

KIRK
(to Ilia almost
pleasant)
No
(then to crew
commandingly)
Secure all stations Clear
the bridge
A moment where all are startled at this order -- but

no time for questions as just then the ship is ROCKED
BY A FURIOUS POWERFUL ERUPTION NEARBY within Vger

DECKER
(amplified)
Bridge to all deckssecure
your stations

McCOY
Your child is having a

tantrum Spock

SULU
Clear the bridge Captain

KIRK
That was the order Mr Sulu
Clear the bridge

Just then another ERUPTION -- the ship is ROCKED AGAIN
337 INT INSIDE VGER - THE ENTERPRISE 337
rocked about by the furious powerfields -- with

frightening displays of ray energy
338 INT BRIDGE 338

as all react to the powerful blasts holding on to

their stations for the evacuation The DAMAGE REPAIR
TECHNICIAN leaves his station crossing to exit

DAMAGE TECH

Jim what the hell kind of
strategy is this

Meanwhile Decker has crossed to Chekovs now abandoned

DECKER
All ships functions going to

339 ANGLE ON KIRK 339
turning to confront Ilia

KIRK
If Vger destroys the Enterprise
the information Vger requires
will also be destroyed
339A

339A INCLUDING VIEWER

as LIGHT SHOW outside perceptically recedes and simul-
taneously the ROCKING CEASES At the same time Ilia
is saying

ILIA
It is illogical to withhold
required information

Kirk does not reply to this turns away to observe

the withdrawing crew Most are out only Spock

Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his
way The bridge lighting dims and now Kirk looks at
Spock who nods approvingly clearly Spock is the only
person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing and
why As Kirk now moves toward the exit and the lights
are dimmed even further

ILIA
(almost polite)
Kirk-unit why do you not
disclose information

KIRK
Because Vger is going to
destroy all the carbon units
on the third planet

ILIA
They have repressed the Creator

KIRK
The information will not be
disclosed

And gesturing the others ahead of him Kirk starts
toward the bridge elevator Ilia calls after him

ILIA
(almost a plea)
Vger needs the information

AT THE ELEVATORS

Decker and McCoy about to enter Spock and Kirk just
behind -- all stopping abruptly now at TIlias state-
ment The very tone of her voice is enough for them
to realize they have made a very telling point Kirk
follows fast

KIRK
Then Vger must withdraw its

orbiting devices

ILIA

Vger will comply if the carbon
units disclose the information

ANGLE ON McCOY
wryly reacting to this

McCOY
It learns fast doesnt it

ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK

as Kirk looks at Spock Kirks whole expression convey-
ing the obvious question What the hell do we do now
But Spock is ready with an answer

SPOCK
Captain the vessel -- Vger --
obviously operates from a
central brain complex

Spock allows the sentence to hang as he and Kirk
eye each other significantly the CAMERA SWINGING
OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this
idea has an even greater significance

KIRK
(to Spock)
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from the point
then

SPOCK
Precisely

Kirk nods grimly faces Ilia again this time
hes playing for all the stakes

KIRK
The carbon units information
cannot be disclosed to Vgers
probe only to Vger directly

ANOTHER ANGLE - REACTIONS

all wait with hushed expectancy all eyes on Ilia
who seems momentarily in some internal communication

She turns away from Kirk and steps forward looking at

imprisoned But now toward the chamber-end where
further passage had previously been barred by the lace-
work energy barriers -- an OPENING APPEARS And at

DECKER
Forward motion Captain

SPOCK

Tlia steps down from the platform and into the well
where she is closer to the viewer

DECKER
Captain whats the next move

KIRK
The question is Mr Decker is
there a next move

INT VGER - THE ENTERPRISE

moving through the chamber pulled by the invisible
tractor beam toward the OPENING -- toward the next
chamber which from this POV seems even larger
more forbidding

INT BRIDGE

as the four officers step down onto the bridge Spock
hurrying to his science station Kirk to the center
seat

KIRK
Resume duty stations Mr Decker

As Kirk attends to his console Deck is at an
intercom

DECKER
(into intercom

All personnel resume stations

At the same time the lights are brightening -- and
members of the bridge crew begin returning All this
time there is an ever increasing sense of movement
Kirk glances at Decker

KIRK
Well Mr Decker it seems my
bluff is being called

DECKER

Im afraid our hand is pretty
weak Captain

(slight smile)
But its the only game in town

Kirk reacts pleased a split beat at Deckers our
hand and goes on

Kirk throws him a look of appreciation then abruptly
his manner changes as he addresses Chekov

KIRK

350 EXT ENTERPRISE - INT VGER

The ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly
more active than anything we have previously seen
Directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches
powerfields a tremendous volume of them seem to ema-
nate and converge there The medium from which the
ship moves appears almost solid to the point where it
seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through

like alien life This should

ANGLE ON SPOCK 351

His back to the viewer the angle does not reveal his
facial features but we can discern him struggling to
contain his feelings

WIDER ANGLE (INCLUDE KIRK McCOY AND DECKER) 352

Kirks back to Spock as he watches the viewer Kirk
now turning toward Spock

KIRK
Spock Spock

Spock does not respond then Kirk reacts with momentary
annoyance then realizes Spock is totally distracted
Kirk peers at him a moment then suddenly rises and
steps up to

SPOCKS STATION - KIRK AND SPOCK (McCOY IN BG) 353

as Kirk arrives with Spock still facing away from
him clearly distracted

KIRK
(starts)
Mr Spock -- I think

Spock moves to face him turning fully INTO the CAMERA
so we can see now just under Spocks eye

A tear Welling fom the eye rolling down his cheek

Kirk is speechless a moment glances at McCoy who has
also witnessed this phenomenon and started toward
Spock but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back as he
addresses Spock

KIRK
(quiet feeling)
Not for us

SPOCK
No Captain not for us for Vger

Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him then
continues

SPOCK
(continuing)
I weep for Vger as I would for
a brother -- far more knowledgeable
than I -- and yet one step behind
ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER 354

Listening McCoys face reflecting concern Deckers
face compassion and understanding with Decker step-
ping closer to Spock as Spock continues

SPOCK
As I was -- when I came aboard
so is Vger now empty incomplete
Searching Logic and knowledge are
not enough

McCOY
(with empathy)
Spock are you saying that you
found what you needed -- but Vger

hasnt
SPOCK
Has not Doctor -- and now because
of what we are planning will not
KIRK

(almost hard)
There is no alternative

DECKER
(gently pressing)
Mr Spock what would Vger need
to fulfill itself

SPOCK
Vger has begun to understand the
true limits of our universe
thereby realizing the existence
of other dimensions To fulfill

itself it must evolve to a
higher dimension Vger believes
this can be achieved only by
joining with the Creator

SPOCK (ALTERNATIVE)
Each of us at some time in our
life turns to someone a father
a brother a God and asks Why
am I here What was I meant
to be Vger hopes to touch its
Creator to find its answers

ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER

as Decker reacts with sudden almost evangelical en-
lightenment as Kirk Says

KIRK

Is this all that I am Is there
nothing more

PAST KIRK AND SPOCK TO THE VIEWER

where another opening is suddenly visible -- another
chamber But the violent and color energy effects of
the previous chambers are no longer evident Instead
the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical
with a strange subdued glow which increases as we
move closer

SPOCK
(flat)
Captain I believe that is our
destination

EXT ENTERRISE - INT VGER - NEAR THE ISLAND
COMPLEX

This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere laced
throughout with dazzling energy patterns not at all
ominous but quite lovely in effect As the Enterprise
continues forward motion now ahead you will to SEE a
small island Floating in the exact center of the
hemisphere the island seems alive with PULSING LIGHT
with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and
COLORS On the island vague at this distance ap
pears to be a solid matter form

INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER

The island looming larger in the distance And the
Enterprise (as evidenced from the viewer) perceptibly
slowing Kirk just resuming his command chair as

as Kirk turns from the intercom and glances at McCoy
Between them a total look of understanding

EXT ENTERPRISE (INT VGER)

The Enterprise approaching the edge of the island --
slowing but still quite clearly being pulled by the
tractor beam The solid matter in the island cen-
ter still obscured by the STRANGE LIGHT GLOW emanating
from that area The Enterprise is now nearly at the
island edge

Deckers last word is interrupted by an almost gentle
BUMP -- and on the Viewer all perceptible motion has
stopped At the same time

reacting to a console reading with surprise

CHEKOV
Captain I read an oxygen and
gravity envelope forming outside
the Enterprise

UHURA
Sir I have located the source
of Vgers radio signal (its)

SPOCK
That transmitter is a vital link
between Vger and the Creator

All this has caused Kirk to vacillate but he still
believes his course of action is the proper one as-

ILIA
The carbon units will now provide
Viger the required information

Tlia is moving toward the elevator turning to face
the others as she says this Kirk remains frozen his
hand on the intercom button He glances at McCoy as
though seeking advice McCoy peers at him blandly
levelly Kirk must follow his own instinct

FAVORING KIRK

gazing at Ilia then at Spock his brain racing con-
sidering all the possibilities options He glances

at the anxious faces awaiting his decision a possible
twenty-two more minutes of life -- or instant death
Another beat as he decides Then

KIRK
(into intercom)
Mr Scott were holding off
there may be a chance

(rises gestures
Spock and McCoy)
Spock Bones

He starts for elevator

PAST DECKER TO KIRK

as Kirk strides toward the elevator joining McCoy and
Spock

KIRK
Mr Decker I will contact you
every five minutes Otherwise
inform Mr Scott immediately

DECKER
(calls after him)
Captain Id like to go along

Kirk studies Decker a beat -- there is something com-
pelling about Deckers manner -- a certain sense of
absolute necessity Kirk seems about to deny the re-
quest then turns to Sulu

KIRK
Mr Sulu you have the conn

And Kirk leaves Decker his face reflecting a strange
almost eager gratification hurries after him

KIRK
Viger plans to literally meld
to reduce both itself and the
Creator to patterns

SPOCK
and then to reassemble itself
combined with the Creator The
most certain way of obtaining
all the Creators answers

A sudden STORM OF LIGHT AND STRANGE SOUND In the
midst of it Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much
centering on him He sees Ilia watching him with
none of their former navigator in her expression
now Kirk hesitates gathering his thoughts

KIRK
(to Ilia)
Our data is being prepared

ILIA
Answer

KIRK
We will answer and present proof

of our answer when it is ready

Kirks words lead to a suggestion of FRUSTRATION in the
STORM OF LIGHT AND SOUND around them

KIRK
(continuing)
Viger we will bring the Creator
to you Here

367 ANGLE EMPHASIZING ILIA AND DECKER 367
as he moves to her

DECKER
We need only a few more minutes
Believe me

Decker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins
at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet
tumbling a hard fall Then the robe looks at him
lying there -- just the slightest softening of her
features now

368 EMPHASIZING DECKER 368

slowly turning to face the probe again

DECKER
Ilia believe me the Creator
will appear
369 EMPHASIZING ILIA 369

as she meets Deckers look her expression softening
still more The STORM OF LIGHT and SOUND begins to
subside a bit She moves to him and he gets to his feet

UHURAS INTERCOM VOICE

McCOY
Thats preposterous They
wouldnt have kept scientific

CHEKOVS INTERCOM VOICE
We are now checking with Starfleet
Archives Captain Stand by

ANGLE ON DECKER AND ILIA 372

Kirk Spock and McCoy are standing some distance from
them (out of hearing) The probe is clearly moving

into still closer touch with Lt Ilias memory patterns
as Decker takes her hand

DECKER
And when Vger melds What will
happen to you

ILIA
It will take me from you

KIRK SPOCK AND McCOY 373

McCoy is looking at Kirk with an incredulous expression
on his face

McCOY
And when it realizes what the
Creator is

KIRK

Theres no way to know Vger
expected it to be a machine --
some single entity
(indicates entire
site)
All of us here may be reduced
into patterns

SPOCK
That seems to be what it has
planned -- to have the Creator

physically present here
McCOY
(small smile)

The God it captures is going to
be a hell of a disappointment

DECKER AND ILIA 374

at the side of Voyager Six Decker in the midst of

twisting a wing-nut which releases a hatch which swings
open Decker peers inside while Ilia waits

KIRK SPOCK AND McCOY

Decker and Ilia at the old capsule in bg as Kirk
looks that way

KIRK
Commander

We SEE Decker look up at Kirks call then ignore him
and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch At
this moment from Kirks communicator a SIGNAL

KIRK
(continuing
into communicator)
Kirk here

UHURAS INTERCOM VOICE
We now have the response code

sir
KIRK
Stand by Transmit it on my
orders
The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk Spock and

McCoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and
resignation Then Kirk lifts his communicator again

KIRK
(continuing)
Enterprise transmit

DECKER AND ILIA

catching Decker in the midst of pressing a control on
his tricorder Both he and Ilia are watching Kirk
and the others closely Now Decker looks down at the
tricorders face He nods

DECKER
Recording

KIRK SPOCK AND McCOY

still waiting They continue to wait McCoy shifts
uncomfortably throws Kirk a puzzled glance Kirk
finally lifts his communicator

KIRK
Enterprise are you transmitting

UHURAS INTERCOM VOICE
Affirmative Captain For some

time now

KIRK
Confirm code and transmitting
frequency

CHEKOVS INTERCOM VOICE
Both signal and frequency
confirmed sir

DECKER
(calling)
Captain Kirk

378 VARIOUS ANGLES 378
as the others turn to Decker and Ilia

DECKER

(continuing)
The fault is here sir not in
the transmission

(indicating into

hatch)
The antenna leads have been
disconnected Vger never
intended to accept a transmitted
signal

KIRK
Capture God In order to
retrieve Vgers data the
Creator has to physically come
here

DECKER

And plug the signal directly into
the circuitry at this

(indicates into

access)

point here Captain It

should pick up even a tricorder
playback

KIRK
(lifting communicator)
Enterprise I want that signal
again Transmit

Then Kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly
as Decker did earlier Then he looks up reacts as
he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a
smile playing on Deckers face

379 ACTION ANGLE 379

as Kirk suddenly pivots races toward Decker -- but he

passes too close to the Ilia-probe It sends him
spinning back tumbling to his knees

AT KIRK 380

as KIRK starts up to scramble to his feet but Spock has
stepped in putting a hand on Kirks shoulder and re
straining him

SPOCK
Jim he wants it

DECKER
You got the Enterprise its
what you wanted This is what
I want
(smiles)
But Jim
(now very seriously)
Im the right choice for this
mission

And then Decker shoves the tricorder into the access
hatch

VARIOUS EFFECTS SHOTS - DECKER BEING FUSED - VGER 381
TRANSCENDING (S)

For just an instant nothing happens -- and then a
BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT STRIKES Decker The color
becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER begins spiraling through
the room Ilia stes toward Decker is caught in the
LIGHT and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW

We SEE Decker seeming to grow larger -- as if his
molecular pattern is expanding A SPECTACULAR SERIES
OF VISUALS THE SPIRALING LIGHT enveloping the entire
area

All this emanating from Deckers body becoming LARGER
-- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost
transparent And the SPIRALING now expanding in all
directions and the room itself starting to dissolve
vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to
slip into the new dimension

Kirk Spock and McCoy stand transfixed another instant
Around them Vger seems to be TRANSFORMING INTO BRIL-
LIANT LOVELY PATTERNS They all turn and race into
the complex in the direction of their vessel

EXT EARTH ORBIT - AN ENERGY BOLT (S) 382
It too seems to be flowering into loveliness brilliant

graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another
dimension vanishing
383 EXT VGER - FULL SHOT 383

The FLOWERING EFFECT now spreading outward Vgers
massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting
graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence
into another dimension

And then all of that is left is a shimmering jewel-like
point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals
there in the blue-black of space the USS Enterprise

384 INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER 384

which shows now only space and its familiar star
patterns All gaze at the viewer awed at what theyve
seen and undergone They exchange looks silently no
one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some-
thing which is beyond mere words We HEAR an ELEVATOR
DOOR Scott and Chapel ENTER the bridge and stand
silently watching

McCOY
Well it certainly has been
interesting

KIRK

Spock we were its answer

SPOCK
(nods)
Yes Captain It needed our
mortality the fear of it our
struggle against it our fears
our dreams

KIRK
»» and the foolish emotions
which drive us

SPOCK
(looks at Kirk then)
I prefer your poet Dantes phrase
-- the divine restlessness of
the human spirit

McCOY
Spock youre quoting poetry

Spocks cold look at McCoy is interrupted by

UHURA
Starfleet signal Captain
Return to orbital dockyard for
inspection

KIRK
Ignore that signal
(to Scott)
Shall we give the Enterprise a
proper shakedown Mr Scott

SscoTT
(suddenly beaming)
Id say its time for that I
would sir
(toward Spock)
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days Mr Spock

SPOCK
(coolly)
I have no business on Vulcan
Engineer
Kirk and Spock exchange a look -- then Kirk turns to
the helm
KIRK

Ahead Warp One Mr Sulu

DIFALCO

KIRK
(taking center seat
indicates generally)

SPOCK
(nods gravely)
A most logical choice Captain
Then the trace of a smile comes over Spocks face

385 EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE (S) 385

Planet Earth in the distance and receding in size as
the starship heads out the other direction

FADE OUT

THE END
