EXT GANYMEDE

Jupiter dominates the horizona titanic yellow-
orange mass covering most of the sky Standing
on Ganymedeyou have to look almost directly
upwards to see Jupiters polar cap

The red spot swirls near the middlelike a giant
furious sore Bands of colors stretch across the
surfaceand bleed into one another giving
warning of the violence that is occurring on the
surface

You see this terrible gaseous warfare going on
and there is no noise You know that there are
sounds down there that you dont ever want to hear

Most of all however it is the sheer size of
Jupiter It looms so enormous in the skythat
you can feel its gravity You sometimes are afraid
to jump from Ganymedes surfaceafraid that you
will be sucked into Jupiters pulland be drawn
closer and closerand then you will hear what it
really sounds likeand then you will be swallowed

That is a fairly common phenomenon on Ganymede It
is quite similar to the kind of disorientation skin
divers can experience Most of the workers lose
their sense of up and down for a whilesimply
because of the constant sight of Jupiter in the sky
making them feel that they are going to fall inward
rather than down

They soon get over it

The mine scales the sheer wall of the crater The
platform glistens in the harsh half light from the low
sun It contains a series of angular structures

They are connected by what look like plastic vacuum
hoseswhich are passageways

The sunlight is almost always from the horizon
causing elongated shadows It kicks up brilliant pin
spots of white glare on the platform There is an
overwhelming quality of impermanence to these
structures The effect is almost like Dodge City in
the 1870sthis small temporary settlement of ugly
buildingsbroiling in the sunlight and freezing
in the shadow °
The scaffolding is orange oxidized metaland it
stretches more than 200 feet down the inside wall of
the crater The lower 100 feet are in total darkness

and the men use brilliant work lightswhich cast
bizarre shafts of yellow-white on the face of the
wall

The mining equipment is all oversized Gargantuan
yellow cranes on thick treads crawl around the rim
Pumps and generators pulsate in a web of intake and
outflow pipes that stretch from the crater to the
storage silos It all looks like it was made by
Matell

The workers wear colorcoded environment suits The
workers in the crater wear yellow Equipment drivers
wear red Maintenance personnel wear blue Manage-
ment wear white The suits are equipped with oxygen
tanks and heating units Everyone has their name
stenciled on the left breast pocket

All of the workers in the crater have safety tethers
stretching from the scaffolding Since there is one-
sixth gravitymen can float from one level to
another by a slight push The only sounds we hear

are the constant crackling of staticand sporadic
dialogueheard through the intercom systems

We are on the ninth level of the scaffold A line of
men are using electric arcs to cut into the rock The
ninth level is in shadowso the men are in the hot
pool of yellow work light The harsh white sunlight
is streaking the upper part of the crater in the
background

One of the men pushes off his platformand floats
upward It looks like everybody is under water

WALTERS
No way JI told them no way
theyre gonna bring an
automated vacuum loader here

HUGHES
When they installed them on
14 and 23 they said it was
just a temporary experiment
Wellthey’re still in there

Walters places a thin metal object in Hughes glove
We can see that both men are perspiringcausing
their face plates to fog up

He tries to dig inside his suit with his clumsy gloved
hands He is scratching at his shoulder

TARLOW
Get it oooouuuttttttttttt

Tarlow lurchés forward and grabs a sharp drilling bit
He stabs at the shoulder of his suittrying to
puncture the material

HUGHES
HolyTarlow dont

Both Hughes and Walters are too late

Tarlow rips through the reinforced layers of the suit
tearing a gash in the material near the base of his
helmet It is almost instantaneous There is no
pressure outside All of the ‘air bursts through the
opening with a terrible woosh Tarlows face turns
crimson with the immediate build-up of blood trying to
burst through his veins Everything is trying to get
out at the same time He doesnt have time to scream

His eyes explode from their sockets and smear against
the inside of his face plate Red and grey pulp blast
through the holes in his skulland fill his helmet

Tarlows body tumbles forward over the railing It
falls in slow motion down towards the bottom of the
eraterand then is jolted to a stop as it reaches
the end of the tether It dangles thereat the
bottom of this long green linearms outstretched
leaking a thick red syrupmaking no sound Ail we
can hear is the static

INT ONIEL QUARTERS MORNING

The interior of all the buildings resembles an aircraft
carrier Everything inside is metal The doors are all
bulkheads Most of the ventilation system is exposed
and runs under the low ceilings ONiels quarters

are the typical officer quarters It is a suite
consisting of two very small bedrooms a bathroom with
astall shower and a family room consisting of a

kitchen area a dining alcove and a lounge-like alcove
Almost everything is built-inand is unfinished metal
One wall has two television screens a computer board
and all of the environment controls

Carol ONiel is placing frozen waffles and a cup of
coffee into a microwave oven She is a woman in her
middle thirties She has dark haira lean figure
and the kind of intelligent chicness that appears
somewhat out of place in this kind of situation There
is an unmistakable melancholy about her that pervades
her movements

Paul ONiel is propping his eleven year old elbows on
the formica tablewaiting for breakfast He is an
alert little boywith a sophistication that comes
from knowing more than he should know

ONIEL

William Thomas ONiel strides into the room He is an
athletic looking man in his fortieswith a hard kind
of grace to him He is a man who doesnt seem to fit
too well in things like chairs or rooms That quality
comes from his looksnot his size He looks like he
belongs outdoorsespecially when he is indoors

PAUL
Till I get my braces off

ONiel snaps on one of the television screensand
punches in a code on the computer

ONIEL
You want crooked teeth

The chairs are matching grey The lighting is from
florescent slabs-hanging from the geodesic ceiling

We slowly drift through this loud roompast the
clusters of men telling dirty jokes at their tables
past some of the women workers who are sitting
togethertowards the back

A man enters He looks just like everybody else He is
fairly largewith a nose that is flattened at the
bridgeobviously from being broken many years ago

His dark eyes pan the mess halllooking for someone

At a table near the sideone of the workers puts down
his coffee mug He gets up and walks to the back
His eyes never look directly at the man who has just
entered The worker opens a door and leaves the mess

INT LOCKER ROOM MORNING 4

The locker room is a series of extremely narrow aisles
cutting through endless rows of high grey metal
lockers Workers are changing into their environment
suitsstill carrying on loud raucous conversations
They barely have enough room to put the bulky suits on
in the confines of the cramped aisles

The worker from the cafeteria pushes through an aisle
to his locker He pushes the combination keys in the
proper sequencesand opens the locker door

The other man is about ten seconds behind the worker
We are a distance awaytoo far away to hear what is
being said All we can really see is that the man
pauses at the workers locker long enough to give him
something There appears to be an exchange of some
kindand words spoken The man is on his way
and the worker is starting to put on his environment
suitin a matter of just a few seconds

There are Waiters here This is not a cafeteria

About forty people are finishing their coffee They
are all facing a table at the front of the room
Seated at the table is a man in his early forties
There is a canniness to his features It is the kind
of intelligence lurking in his dark eyes that makes
him formidable despite the fact that he is neither
large nor athletic looking it is the kind of face
that is not used to waiting on lines His name is
Sheppard

Next to him is ONiel who is standing facing the
people Seated next to ONiel is Montone ONiel
has been speaking

ONTIEL
FinallyI realize’Im new

to get to know meand Im
going to have to get to know
you I just hope I can justify
your confidence

There is total silence in the room You can hear the
coffee lapping against the rims of the cups

He slowly sits down The quiet hangs in the air like
a fog

twelve year old Her grey eyes emit a wry fatigue

then removes the drawer He reaches inside the empty
space behind the drawer and pulls out a tiny vial

He places the vial inside the vaccination gun Then
he presses the gun against his inner thigh There is
a soft thumping sound as the gun delivers its charge

Sagan sits back and inhales deeply He closes his eyes
After a pausehe quickly places the vaccination gun
back in the drawer and slides the drawer into its place

droplets of sweatare beading over his lips His

eyes are wild with excitement His face is contorted
in a manic smile

One of his arms is around the bare chest of a young
brunette prostitute His other arm holds a long thin
knife The blade is gleaming in the light The point
of the knife is at the girls throatpuckering the
skinand forcing her to strain her neck backwards

at a tortured angle

The prostitute is bleeding from a broken nose Her
lower lip is splitand her jaw is beginning to
discolor from a terrible blowobviously done with a
closed fist She is whimpering with terrorand
almost unconscious form being beaten so badly

The freight dock is a cavernous areastretching over
one hundred yards It looks like a giant hangar
except it is more organized A series of rail spurs

meet at one end for hopper cars and other conveyer
vehicles to unload their ore All of the freight is
segregated into type and then loaded into huge containers
The containers are put into the freight bay of the
shuttle and then shipped out

At night the freight dock is deserted Harsh bare
lamps burn at the bottoms of long poles hanging from
the ceiling

They cast individual funnels of light The rest of
the hangar is black

A tiny spot appears at the end of the freight dock

It moves into a pool of light and then into shadow

All of them are covered with a bright company logo
Underneath the logo is the category of the container
Most of them are unrefined ore

Towards the back of the building there are two
containers with different markings ONiel inspects
them His shadow dances across the shiny white sides
of the containerspast the company logopast the
word Fragile The second container has a different
marking It states To Be Jettisoned

ONiel looks around him The area is so vast and so
quiet his breathing sounds thunderous Very carefully
he opens the four latches at one end of the container
They each make a loud metallic click ONiel pulls

the huge side lid open and shines his flashlight

inside

The round beam skips across a pile of metal boxes

All of them have a three triangle sign indicating they
are radiomactive waste On the lower left hand side
there is a silver mylar body bag

ONiel stoops down and inspects the bag He slowly
pulls the zipper First we can see strands of hair
then the foreheadthen two eyes wide open with
terror and surprise Finally Sagans entire face

is gaping upward

ONiel ptils the zipper halfway down the body reveal-
ing the red stained gauze that was placed over the

hole in his chest ONiel reaches in his breast pocket

Nothing seems out of the ordinary

He reaches in his pocket and takes out a small knife
He makes a thin slice in the fat layer He pokes his
finger in We see his face We can read by his
expression that he has felt something

He quickly slices away the fat layer on one side He
reaches in and peels the layer back from the meat
There is no meat underneath There are more than one

Both the catwalk and the top of the panel are only

ONiel waits until Ballard is almost directly below

him He swings over the catwalk railing and drops

straight downkicking violentlyand striking the
side of Ballards helmet

The impact sends Ballard reeling forwards The gun

goes flying out of his hands The impact also sends
ONiel floating backwardsover the side of the collector
panel

The gun floats down and scrapes along the side of the
panel There is an explosion of sparks by the mere
contact of the chargedfield The light display of
sparks continues as the gun strikes the bottom panel
It falls hundredsof feet down

side Ballard has stumbled to his feet He turns

Both men tumble over the sideand float past the
sparking panel Their struggle is lit by the fuming
mass of orange in the sky They claw at the air
trying to find something to grab on to and trying to
avoid contact with the panel

ONiel manages to grab onto the struts under the first
row of collector panels and above the second row It
stops his fall Ballard grabs the same strut

They both grapple and climb onto the narrow strut
Their images flicker in the blue sparks and are rim
lit by the orange from Jupiter in the black sky

The wound in ONiels shoulder is beginning to take

its toll He cant hold on with both arms Ballard
leaps at ONieland starts to pry his one hand

from the strut ONiel doesnt have the strength

to keep holding on He takes his free hand and reaches
around for the valve leading from Bailards air tank

Ballard has almost succeeded in prying ONiels hand
from the strutwhen ONiel closes the valve Ballard
draws a breath and starts to choke He involuntarily
lets go of ONielto reach for his air valve

ONiel makes one last kick with both legs at the chest
of Ballard both of whose hands are on his back It
is enough to send him down and sideways Ballards
right boot strikes the surface of the collector panel

There is a blue-white eruption of sparks Ballards

body goes rigid with the jolt He strikes the panel

again Another shower of terrible light He tumbles
slowly downwardskipping off the panelshimmering
with the electricity that is surging through him

He falls freehundreds of feet downward He is not
moving His stiff body almost disappears in the
distancewhen it lands on the transformers The buz
zing of the electricity as it devours him is a harsh
flare on the distant bottom of the platform
