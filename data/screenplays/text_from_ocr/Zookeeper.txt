It’s a beautiful spring day at the charming old-fashioned
zoo on the outskirts of town The sun is shining The trees
are blooming And yet only a few visitors are there

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - ELEPHANT HABITAT - DAY

One of the ZOOKEEPERS is making his daily rounds This is
ANDREW BRECKMAN late thirties lovable and sweet He enters
the elephant habitat carrying an open bale of hay and dumps
it on the ground

A family of ELEPHANTS including a baby stand watching

ANDREW
There you go guys

The elephants just stare at him

ANDREW
We’re just having it plain today

The elephants continue to stare Andrew finally caves

ANDREW
Alright fine

Andrew looks around then surreptitiously takes out a large
plastic squirt bottle from his wheelbarrow

ANDREW
a little peanut oil

He squirts some oil onto the hay The elephants step forward
to eat

ANDREW
But if I see anyone’s blood
pressure go up it’s gonna be
nothing but wheatgrass for a month
Understand

EXT GORILLA HABITAT - DAY

A father GORILLA has little baby gorillas climbing all over
him Andrew stands outside the pen holding something behind
his back

ANDREW

news is I got
Andrew pulls out a large bunch of those TINY TROPICAL
BANANAS

ANDREW
-mini bananas

The little gorillas GO CRAZY with excitement
EXT GIRAFFE’S HABITAT - DAY

Andrew is up on a ladder He is digging his elbow into the
back of a GIRAFFE giving it a massage

ANDREW
God you’ve got a real knot in
there

Just then a YOUNG COUPLE IN LOVE passes by They stop and
kiss before continuing on As Andrew watches he
inadvertently digs his elbow even harder into the giraffe
The giraffe YELPS and looks back at him

ANDREW
Sorry

INT TORTOISE HABITAT - DAY

mate once every 3 years - and you
still get more action than me

EXT LION HABITAT - DAY

A MOTHER LIONESS lazes in the sun watching her 6 cubs who
play rambunctiously Andrew talks to her through the bars

ANDREW
I got the cubs some chew toys
‘cause they’re starting to teethe

Andrew tosses in a handful of rubber “penguin” chew toys
ANDREW
They’re little penguins
(then whispering)
Don’t tell the penguins

The regal MALE LION sits at a distance staring at Andrew
ANDREW

(to lion)
What Just ‘cause youre King of
the Jungle doesn’t mean I have to
bring you a treat every time I
bring something for

(patting pockets)
-wait a minute

Andrew pulls a DEVIL DOG out of his breast pocket

ANDREW
I can’t believe it A Devil Dog
Your favorite

The Lion walks over Andrew looks around

ANDREW
Don’t tell anyone

Andrew tosses in the Devil Dog The Lion starts to eat it
Andrew lingers at the cage

ANDREW

(wistfully to lion)
It must be nice for you Francisco
having a family I wish I had one
I can’t even meet a girl They all
want to date a lawyer or a stock
broker or something

(then )
Nobody cares about a zookeeper

EXT PANDA HABITAT —- DAY

At the far end of the zoo away from everything else is a
large Panda Habitat A full grown MALE PANDA lives there
Outside the cage a young British boy WILL 10 stands
talking to the bear

WILL
Your name’s Sammy right My mom
told me all about you

Down the path we see Andrew approaching pushing a
wheelbarrow

WILL
(still to panda)
You’re the only one in the zoo
who’s all by himself

ANDREW (0S)
You want to feed him
Will looks over and sees Andrew dressed in his khaki
uniform He obviously works for the zoo

WILL
Really

ANDREW
Absolutely Pandas love bamboo
In fact adult Pandas can eat up to
12 of their weight in bamboo every
day What do you weigh

WILL
73 pounds
ANDREW
Do you know what 12 of 73 is
WILL
No
ANDREW
Neither do I But I bet it’s a lot
of bamboo

Andrew hands Will a stalk of bamboo from his wheelbarrow

WILL
So what do I do

ANDREW
Just hand it to him

Suddenly a voice rings out

KATE
Will There you are

Will looks over A woman approaches This is KATE QUINLIN
She’s 34 and STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL

WILL
Hey mom

Kate comes over Andrew IS MESMERIZED by her
KATE
(to Will)
What are you doing
WILL

Feeding the panda This man gave
me some bamboo

Kate turns to Andrew
KATE
Hi I’m Kate Quinlin

Kate extends her hand Andrew shakes her hand still in awe

ANDREW
Hi Andrew It’s nice to make
your pleasure

KATE
You must be one of the zoo keepers

ANDREW
Yes Well Habitational Engineers
is the official title but you
could definitely call me Andrew

WILL
Mom’s a panda expert
ANDREW
Really
(then )

Wait You’re not the zoologist
who’s bringing the female panda for
Sammy are you

KATE
You seem surprised

ANDREW
(fumpfering)
Oh no I just didn’t expect a
zoologist to have lipstick
and legs in a skirt like that

KATE
You were expecting a legless
lipless zoologist

ANDREW
No I just mean

KATE
It’s okay I get this a lot

ANDREW
You came from London right

KATE
Yes We just arrived

ANDREW
And you brought your whole family
KATE
Actually it’s just me and Will
these days
(putting arm around Will)
-right pal

WILL
Right
ANDREW
Just you two
(then )

Well I should give you my pager
number You know in case you need
someone to show you around or
something

KATE
Oh that’s

ANDREW
No it’s fine I’ve got a pad and
pen right

Andrew pulls out a pad from his breast pocket The pad is
COVERED IN A DISGUSTING GOOEY SLIME

ANDREW
Oh the giraffes They’re always
looking for food in my pockets
Their drool is a little slimy
Wait I’ve got a handkerchief

Andrew pulls out a hanky from pants pocket WET DOLLOPS of
DARK GOOP fall out of it

ANDREW
Oh yeah I used this for the bat
guano on the snack cart

Just then a voice rings out

VOICE
Kate There you are

Everyone looks up to see a HANDSOME MAN approaching This is
TRENT RAMSEY 39 the Director of the Zoo

KATE
Trent

Trent reaches them

KATE
So good to see you again
Kate and Trent exchange a hug and a kiss on each cheek

TRENT
I was worried you got lost

KATE
Oh no We were on our way to your
office but we ran into Clark here

Andrew
TRENT

Habitational Engineers

Trent turns to Will He offers his hand

TRENT

And you must be Will

(shaking hand)
It’s nice to meet you

(then feigning pain)
Oh my God That’s some grip you’ve
got there mister And what a good
looking young man too But I
guess that’s to be expected with
such a beautiful mother

KATE
That’s very sweet Thank you

Andrew tries to join the conversation

ANDREW
He is very good looking I noticed
that too
Kate and Trent look at Andrew Andrew gives Will the “thumbs
up” It’s an awkward moment and everyone feels it
TRENT

Oh Andrew Several of the spider
monkeys are having some intestinal
issues There’s a fair bit of
liquid fecal matter that needs your
expert attention

ANDREW
Sure Of course
TRENT
Kate Will why don’t you come with
me

Trent starts to lead them off

TRENT
I made us all a pot of tea

KATE
That’s very thoughtful Trent
Thank you

TRENT
Well I wanted you all to feel at
home

Andrew watches them walk off embarrassed and depressed

ANDREW
(to self)
I’m such an idiot

EXT SPIDER MONKEY HABITAT - DAY
Andrew is mopping up the monkey cage He’s not happy

ANDREW

(mimicking himself)

that I mop up poop for a living

The MONKEYS ALL LOOK AT ANDREW quizzically

The camel looks at him

ANDREW
No offense

It’s now dark out Andrew stands outside the Lion cage
filling the drinking trough with a hose

ANDREW
I can’t do this anymore

Andrew turns off the hose
ANDREW
That’s it Tomorrow I’m gonna
start looking for a new job

Hearing this all the ANIMALS STRAIGHTEN UP seemingly
ALARMED

Andrew stows the hose and heads for the zoo exit The
animals watch as Andrew exits the gate locking it behind
him

As soon as he disappears from sight the Lion obviously
distressed steps to the front of his habitat turns to the

The Flamingo turns sideways and slips out between the bars of
his habitat

Behind the habitats is a large common space used for
exercising the animals cleaning them etc All the animals
of the zoo have gathered there now to meet

The scene is bedlam with animals running every which way
Theres squawking grunting and squealing THE ELEPHANT
(ORVILLE) British very proper (think John Cleese) is
disgusted by the lack of order

ELEPHANT (ORVILLE)
(upper crusty English accent)
My God it’s like a zoo in here

The LION FRANSICO a Latin lover with swagger and machismo
(think Antonio Banderas) tries to settle everyone

LION (FRANCISCO)
(Castillian accent)
Quiet everyone Quiet please

The animals continue their rumpus The ZEBRA (VITO) a
Jersey mobster (think James Gandolfini) turns to the Lion

ZEBRA (VITO)
I got this

The Zebra stomps on the tail of a big SCARLET MACAW who lets
out a piercing scream

MACAW
Ahhhhhhh

Suddenly everyone goes quiet

ZEBRA (VITO)
(to Lion)
Go ahead

The Lion addresses the crowd

LION (FRANCISCO)
Greetings everyone I think you
all know why we are here

(MORE )

LION (FRANCISCO) (contd)
Andrew the greatest zoo keeper in
the history of the world is
thinking about leaving us

All the animals react upset

ANTEATER
He’s the only one who goes through
our food and picks out the fire
ants

LITTLE ANIMAL WITH HUGE EARS
He cleans my ears - which is no
small feat

OWL
He sings us to sleep every morning

The GIRAFFE SHAWN a total stoner (think Seth Rogan meets
Jeff Spicoli) interrupts

GIRAFFE (SHAWN)
Hold on dudes Which one is
Andrew again

PENGUIN
The one that massages your rump
every time your hip goes out

GIRAFFE (SHAWN)
Ohhhhh That dude is awesome

LION (FRANCISCO)
Yes but he’s lonely and wants to
leave

The GORILLA STANLEY sensitive neurotic (think Ra
Romano) who always has his kids climbing all over him

speaks up

GORILLA (STANLEY)

I’d hate to be alone Having a
family is the best Kids around
all the time - it’s bliss

(then yelling at kids)
Jeremy stop pulling my ears
Blake that’s your private area
No one wants to see that

ELEPHANT (ORVILLE)
We can not afford to lose Andrew
We must find a mate for him

The PEACOCK (CLYDE) a black street hustler (think Katt
Williams) speaks up

PEACOCK (CLYDE)

Look if all he needs is a little
female companiontude I‘11 just
hook him up with one of my ladies

(then )
Doreen come on out here and give
these fellas a little taste of what
I’m talkin’ ‘bout

A FEMALE PEACOCK struts into the common area and prances
about

PEACOCK (CLYDE)
That’s right baby Shake ya tail

(then to other animals)
Now who’s gonna say “no” to that

EMU

PANDA (SAMMY)
(heavy Chinese accent)
This problem not so easy Andrew

lady who come see me Her name
Kate She very pretty

ZEBRA (VITO)
Guys I’ve seen this broad
There’s no way a regular joe like
Andrew is gonna score a classy dame
like that

LION (FRANCISCO)

He can if I help him Remember my
friends I am a master in the art
of love

A voice comes from behind him

VOICE
Pfft

Francisco whips around
LION (FRANCISCO)

Who said “pfft” I distinctly
heard a “pfft”

Two sexy LIONESSES CLAUDIA and ANA (think Penelope Cruz and
Salma Hayek) step forward

LIONESS (CLAUDIA)
What are you going to teach him
Francisco How to lie around all
day and eat Devil Dogs until his
butt’s the size of a warthog

LION (FRANCISCO)

Be careful what you say woman If
this were the wild Id cast you
out

LIONESS (ANA)
If this were the wild you’d be a
rug in a safari lodge somewhere

The Lionesses exit There’s an awkward silence

ANTEATER
(sing-song)
Awwwk-ward

WARTHOG
(looking over his shoulder)
Is my butt really that big

Just then THE FLAMINGO (LENNY) who thinks he’s an ACTION
HERO steps out of the group

FLAMINGO (LENNY)

(a la movie action hero)
That’s it Enough The time for
talk is over people This is a
crisis and a crisis demands
action

The Flamingo turns to Francisco and squints his eyes
dramatically

FLAMINGO (LENNY)
I’1l take it from here But I work
alone I don’t need a partner
(deep voice a la movie
trailer)
Because this time it’s personal

ZEBRA (VITO)

Hey pinkie you’re not an action
hero capiche So shut your beak
or I’m gonna shut it for you

FLAMINGO (LENNY)
Go ahead punk Make my day

The animals start to squawk and whinny taking sides in the
conflict

LION (FRANCISCO)
Silence please

All the animals quiet down

LION (FRANCISCO)
We need to find ways to help Andrew
attract this woman Kate

PEACOCK (CLYDE)
I got it Lets get him wet and
roll him in bird seed Shell see
that and go bananas

GORILLA (STANLEY)
Bananas Now theres an idea
Well just cover him head to toe in
bananas Who can resist that

A slightly scary and sinister looking WOLF speaks from the
shadows

WOLF
(slightly sinister)
Why don’t we just take the child

All the animals look at the Wolf creeped out

PENGUIN
Why is it always “take the child”
with you How is that even going
to help

WOLF
Im just saying its worth a shot

LION (FRANCISCO)

This is ridiculous We’re getting

nowhere It is obvious there is

only one thing for us to do
(then )

We must talk to Andrew

ELEPHANT (ORVILLE)
(taken aback)
Talk to him

LION (FRANCISCO)
Yes tell him exactly how to woo
Kate

ZEBRA (VITO)
You mean break the code

LION (FRANCISCO)
Yes yes Break the code This is
too important to risk failure

ELEPHANT (ORVILLE)
(outraged)
Hold on now man You cant break
the code The rules are very
clear We do not talk to humans

GORILLA (STANLEY)
Its true My cousin Coco the
Gorilla All she did was a little
signing - now theyre working her
to the bone

LION (FRANCISCO)
Look I‘1ll decide what we can and
cannot do Who’s the King of the
Jungle eh

ELEPHANT (ORVILLE)
You’re not King of the Jungle My
God man you’re not even king of
your own castle

Just then a voice calls out from above

VOICE (0S)
If anyone’s king around here it’s
me

Everyone looks up and sees a PIGEON JAKE cool confident
(think VINCE VAUGHN) in a branch overhead

PIGEON (JAKE)
Can anyone else here come and go as
they please No I didn’t think
so

PEACOCK (CLYDE)
We could leave if we wanted

ZEBRA (VITO)
We just don’t wanna

PIGEON (JAKE)
‘Cause you’re scared Not me I’m
free Free as a bird
(then singing)
»-and this bird you can not chaaa-
ange Whoa-whoa-whoa

ELEPHANT (ORVILLE)
This is ridiculous I am not going
to stand here and be lectured by
some filthy rat with wings

A RAT looks up from the corner

RAT
Hey I heard that

ELEPHANT (ORVILLE)
No one is leaving the zoo and we
are certainly not breaking the
code And that is final

Orville storms out Everyone looks at Francisco
LION (FRANCISCO)

Fine We will help him without

breaking the code I only hope it

works Life without Andrew would

be unthinkable
Francisco exits
EXT ZOO GROUNDS - MORNING
It’s the next morning Kate is walking around the zoo She
gets to the Tropical Rainforest Building Curious she goes
inside to look around

Outside the building behind some bushes we see the Zebra
hiding watching He turns to the Flamingo next to him

ZEBRA
Alright she’s in

FLAMINGO
Copy that Cobra One

ZEBRA
Don’t call me Cobra One

FLAMINGO
It’s a code name to protect your

ZEBRA

Disappointed the Flamingo heads off

ZEBRA
Freakin’ bird

INT ZOO KEEPER’S LOUNGE - MORNING

Andrew is alone in the lounge circling HELP WANTED ADS in the
NEWSPAPER The Flamingo enters the lounge

ANDREW
What are you doing out of your
cage

The Flamingo grabs the pen out of Andrew’s hand and runs

ANDREW
Hey

EXT TROPICAL RAINFOREST BUILDING - MORNING

The Flamingo runs across the pavilion and into the Rainforest
Building Andrew chases after him

ANDREW
Come back here

Andrew enters the building The moment he does the Zebra
steps out of the bushes with big stick in his mouth and
wedges it through the handles of the doors effectively
locking them

INT TROPICAL RAINFOREST BUILDING - MORNING

Andrew enters the artificial rainforest looking for the
Flamingo Up ahead he sees his pen lying on the path He
goes to pick it up

KATE (0S)
Andrew

Andrew looks up and sees Kate

ANDREW
Oh hi

KATE
I was just familiarizing myself
with the zoo

ANDREW
(deer in headlights)
I was getting my pen

A safe distance away behind some ferns several of the
animals are hiding watching They speak in hushed tones

LION
Oh my God look at those fireworks

SMALL ANIMAL WITH BIG EARS
Her body temperature just went up 3
degrees

PEACOCK
(“clearing air” with wing)
And those pheromones
(then )
These two are made for each other
Any idiot can smell that

LION
This could be a lot easier than I
thought
FLAMINGO
(confused)
But she has no idea she’s attracted
to him
LION

No not yet But we will fix that

The Lion signals to Big Ears who hits a red button on the
wall with his paw Suddenly it starts “raining” in the
“forest”

Andrew and Kate notice the “rain” as it begins to fall

KATE
Uh-oh

ANDREW
C’mon

Andrew leads Kate to the doors but he can’t open them

ANDREW
(confused)
It’s locked

KATE
My dress is soaking

ANDREW
(fighting doors)
I don’t understand

KATE
(pointing)
Look there’s an overhang We can
huddle underneath until it stops

They run for the overhang like two lovers caught in a storm
It’s a perfect romantic set up until suddenly Andrew SLIPS on
the WET PAVEMENT
ANDREW
Ahhhh

Andrew GOES DOWN HARD

KATE
Are you okay

ANDREW
I think I pulled my groin God it
hurts Ahhh Ahhh

Kate moves to help him up

ANDREW
Don’t touch me Don’t touch me
Ahhh

The animals watch from under a tarp

PEACOCK
Homeboy ain’t exactly a playa is
he

LION
This may be more difficult than I
thought

EXT OUTDOOR DINING AREA - DAY

The zoo has an indooroutdoor cafeteria Kate and Will sit

at an outdoor table having lunch

KATE
How’s the veggie burger

WILL

Not so good But I hate eating
meat at a zoo

KATE
(smiling)
I know what you mean

A little ways off several of the animals watch from behind

some brush The Lion sees Andrew approaching still
slightly with his paper lunch bag and his Want Ads

LION
Here he comes

PEACOCK
A’ight

The Peacock turns to the Female Peacocks

limping

PEACOCK
Do your thing girls

The free-roaming female peacocks walk over to the dining
area As they pass Kate and Will’s table they “accidently”
knock over their drinks

WILL
Whoa

Kate laughs at the craziness of what just happened

KATE
C’mon let’s get refills

Kate and Will get up and go inside the cafeteria as Andrew
arrives at a different table and puts his lunch down He
heads over to the condiment cart to get napkins and utensils

PEACOCK
Alright monkey time

On the Peacock’s cue several SPIDER MONKEYS scamper in
They grab Kate and Will’s trays and move them over to
Andrew’s table

When Kate and Andrew return with their drinks they can’t find
their trays Will spots them at the other table

WILL
There they are

Kate and Will walk over to the table just as Andrew is
returning

The Peacock looks at the Lion pleased

PEACOCK
Bingo Instant lunch date

Will sees Andrew is at their table

WILL
(excited)
Look Mom We’re sitting with
Andrew

KATE
(confused)
That’s strange I could’ve sworn
we were sitting by the fountain

ANDREW
Oh do you want to sit by the
fountain Here let me help

The animals watch in disbelief as Andrew chivalrously helps
Kate and Will with their trays back to their original table -
and then returns alone to his They groan in frustration

PEACOCK
The man is absolutely clueless

LION
Then we must turn him into a hero
It is our only hope No female can
resist a hero

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - OUTSIDE GORILLA HABITAT - AFTERNOON

Three 19 year old boys TROUBLEMAKERS stand outside the
habitat tormenting the Gorilla making obnoxious monkey
noises and exaggerated ape gestures The Gorilla just stares
at them Andrew approaches

ANDREW
Hey guys cut that out

The Troublemakers stop

ANDREW
Be respectful of the animals
Alright

Andrew continues on The second he’s gone the boys resume
their obnoxious behavior

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - MAIN PAVILION AREA - AFTERNOON
Will is outside the Zebra cage talking to the Zebra inside

WILL
(to Zebra)
If you can understand what I’m
saying nod your head like this

Will demonstrates The Zebra just stares at him Trent
passing through the pavilion sees this and heads over

TRENT
You know Will animals are fun to
look at but for the most part
they’re not very intelligent
creatures

Kate comes walking down a path and from a distance sees
Trent with Will She assumes they are bonding and smiles

From his habitat the Lion spots Kate He turns to one of
his CUBS

LION
Alright son Make it good

The Lion goes and hides behind some rocks as the Lion Cub
shoves his paw under a large boulder and pretending to be
stuck wails in “agony”

LION CUB
Aaaahhh

Kate turns and sees the trapped cub in “pain” and alone in
the empty habitat

KATE
Oh no

Kate rushes over to the habitat She uses her key to unlock
the zookeeper’s gate and hurries inside to aid the cub

The Lion still hiding behind the rock sees Andrew
approaching from the other direction It’s perfect timing
The Lion steps out from behind his hiding place and moves
towards Kate Kate who’s “freed” the cub suddenly sees
the full grown male Lion approaching her in a low hunting
crouch She freezes The Lion ROARS WITH EVERYTHING HE’S
GOT trying to sound as menacing as possible

Andrew hears the roar and looks over He sees Kate trapped
and rushes for the cage

Kate starts to back away from the Lion slowly

KATE
It’s okay big fella Everyones
fine

Kate puts the cub down safely on the ground and continues to
back away The Lion roars again and Kate trips falling
backwards down a small embankment

Andrew comes charging into the cage holding a pack of Devil
Dogs

ANDREW
Francisco Look Devil Dog

Andrew dangles the pack The Lion stops and turns heading
towards Andrew Using the bait Andrew lures the Lion back
into the rear holding area

Down on the ground behind the embankment Kate SEES NONE OF
THIS All she sees is Trent rush “heroically” into the now
lion-less cage He hurries over and scoops her into his
arms

TRENT
It’s okay I’ve got you

Trent carries Kate out of the cage

Back in the holding area with Andrew the Lion has finally
gotten his Devil Dog As he eats he sees Trent carrying
Kate out of the habitat He stops chewing and stares slack-
jawed in total disbelief

Outside the habitat Trent continues walking holding Kate in
his arms

KATE
Thank you Trent

TRENT
Well we can’t have our specialists
getting eaten can we

Will comes hurrying over

WILL
Mom

TRENT
You mother’s fine Will I’m just
taking her to first aid
(then to Kate)
Just to be safe

From inside the cage the Lion and Andrew watch helplessly as
Trent carries Kate off Will following behind Trent looks
every bit the hero Kate rests her head on Trent’s shoulder
as they disappear from view

As the Lion watches them go the anger builds in him until HE
JUST CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE FINALLY HE TURNS TO Andrew
AND SCREAMS

LION
YOU IDIOT

Andrew stares at the Lion dumbfounded He’s not sure but
he thinks the lion just called him an idiot

LION
Whats wrong with you We put you
in situation after situation and
you are totally incapable of even
the most basic courting rituals

Andrew just stares mouth agape
LION

Why are you staring at me like a

wounded antelope

ANDREW
Youre talking

LION
Of course I am talking

How can I

not talk You are such an idiot

(then )

Now give me that other Devil Dog

Im starving

ANDREW
Oh my God I’m losing my

mind

Andrew drops the Devil Dog and runs out of the Lion’s

habitat
The Gorilla who is next door sees

GORILLA

what’s happening

Oh boy Francisco broke the code

Andrew moves away from the Lion’s habitat totally

disoriented As he does he passes

right in front of the

Gorilla who has come to the front of his cage

GORILLA
Don’t take it personally
He gets angry He yells
Latin thing

ANDREW
Oh God You too

GORILLA

Andrew
It’s a

Well I figure if the Lion’s doing

it

Andrew is beside himself He’s sure he’s going crazy

ANDREW

I’ve gotta get out of this place

Andrew starts to walk away quickly
passes the ANIMALS inside CALL OUT

But from EACH CAGE he
to him

ZEBRA
Don’t go Andrew You’re part of
the family

PEACOCK

We need you baby

GIRAFFE
Don’t go bro Please

Until finally Andrew reaches the Elephant habitat Orville
stands right at the front He stares him dead in the eye
SWINGING HIS TRUNK back and forth desperately trying to
HYPNOTIZE him

ELEPHANT
(hypnotizing voice)
You heard nothing Animals cant
talk You will remember nothing

ANDREW
Everybody stop talking I’m going
crazy

Andrew turns and sprints for the zoo exit He’s almost out
the gates when in a LAST DITCH EFFORT The Lion calls out

LION
Don’t go Andrew Kate is
completely in love with you

Suddenly Andrew stops short Slowly he turns around and
looks at the Lion

ANDREW
(intrigued)
I’m sorry What did you just say

FADE OUT
EXT ANIMAL COMMON SPACE - EVENING

It’s late The zoo is closed The animals have all convened
in the common area Andrew stands among them looking
uneasy

LION
(to Andrew)
Shes completely taken with you
She just doesn’t realize it yet
You understand

Andrew shakes his head no

ZEBRA
What part don’t you get

ANDREW
The part where the lion and zebra
are talking to me
PEACOCK
This is exactly what happened to
Doolittle Took him weeks to wrap
his mind around it

ANDREW
If animals can talk - why havent
you been talking all this time

ELEPHANT

Because there is a code -
established eons ago to help
maintain order in the universe

(glaring at Lion)
A code which some overgrown alley
cats don’t seem to take very
seriously

LION
It just came out I couldn’t help
it

PORCUPINE
The point is animals don’t talk
‘cause people need to think they’re
superior to us

MACAW
It’s an ego thing

GIRAFFE
Plus dude if humans knew we could
understand them they’d make us
do even more of their bogus work

BIG EARS
Including their most dangerous
jobs

ANDREW
Humans would never make animals do
anything dangerous

WOLF
Oh no Perhaps you should ask my
Uncle Aldo the bomb sniffing dog

FLAMINGO
Personally I’d welcome a little
danger ‘round here I’m a bird of
action Danger’s my middle name

The Flamingo does some swift kung-fu moves

ZEBRA
(to Andrew re Flamingo)
He thinks he’s an action hero He
sneaks into the Zookeeper’s Lounge
and watches all your movies

ANDREW
So that’s why all my DVD’s are
scratched

FLAMINGO

(holding up foot)
These talons are registered lethal
weapons That being said they
suck at picking up DVD’s when they
fall on the floor

ELEPHANT
Look Andrew it is absolutely
essential you tell no one about us
speaking Do we have your word

ANDREW
Yes

WOLF
And if you break this sacred oath
will you agree to give us your
first born child

All the animals stare at the Wolf creeped out

WOLF
t was just a thought

H

ANDREW

Okay assuming I didn’t fall in the
shower this morning and this isn’t
all a dream - How exactly are you
guys gonna help me with Kate

LION

It is simple You must go beyond
her logic and connect with her on
a more primitive level To win the
human you must become more like an
animal

ANDREW
How do I do that

PEACOCK
It’s easy brother See in
nature it’s all about the show
(MORE )

PEACOCK (contd)
If you want to get a honey all you
gotta do is walk up to her and do
this SLA-BAAAM

The Peacock FANS OUT HIS TAIL FEATURES in a DRAMATIC DISPLAY

ZEBRA
Forget colors You don’t want to
look like some fruity bird To
impress the ladies what you want
to be sporting is stripes
Theyre very sophisticated
dignified and let me just add
very slimming

PEACOCK
No man Its all about color
ZEBRA
Stripes
PEACOCK
Color
ZEBRA
Stripes

SCARLET MACAW
Striped colors

RAM
(to Andrew)
Is there any chance you could grow
horns

CONDOR
Or one of these bulbous red things
on top of your head

GORILLA
Hold on everybody Let me just
ask him something

(to Andrew)

This girl you like have you
thrown poop at her yet No Then
what are we even talking about
This is basic stuff people
Basic

Suddenly a voice rings out
VOICE (0S)
Why do you even want to be ina

relationship

Everyone looks up and sees the Pigeon is back on his branch

ELEPHANT
Oh Lord not him again

ANDREW
The pigeon talks too

PIGEON
Listen to me my friend Right now
you’ve got freedom - just like me
But the second you get ina
relationship - it’s Lockdown You
might as well be in a cage like
these suckers That’s why I say
romance is for the birds I mean
other birds Not me

The Elephant sprays the Pigeon with a trunk full of water
and the Pigeon flies away

ANDREW
Okay before I was just freaked
out Now I’m freaked out and
confused

The Wolf steps forward

WOLF
Let me boil this down for you
Andrew In the animal world
everything begins with scent

ANDREW
Scent

WOLF
Yes You will never get anywhere
with this woman until you’ve first
marked your territory

Finally all the animals AGREE ON SOMETHING They respond
with “It’s true” “Absolutely” “I should’ve thought of
that” etc

ANDREW
Mark my territory But people
don’t do that - I mean unless
they’re camping

LION
The Wolf is right Andrew This is
definitely the first step

PEACOCK
A brother’s gotta slap his stink on
things

ZEBRA
Let her know she’s living on your
turf

GORILLA

Or if you prefer you could just
throw poop at her

EXT ZOO - MORNING
It’s early morning the next day

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - OUTER PERIMETER - MORNING

The Wolf has led Andrew to the outer perimeters of the zoo

grounds

WOLF
It’s always best to leave your mark
before the morning dew burns off

ANDREW
(looking around)
And before anyone is awake to see
you

The Wolf finds a spot and stops

WOLF
Okay right here

ANDREW
(pointing at spot)
You want me to pee here

WOLF
No I want you to bake a tart here
What do you think
Andrew unzips his pants

ANDREW
No one likes a sarcastic wolf

Andrew starts to pee

WOLF
Alright stop

ANDREW
Stop

WOLF

Yes that’s enough Stop

ANDREW
I can’t just

WOLF
Stop

Andrew forces himself to stop peeing
ANDREW
(grimacing)
Oh that doesn’t feel good
The Wolf starts walking
WOLF
Conserve your urine We’ve got at

least 12 more spots

ANDREW
1221

The Wolf stops at a different spot

WOLF
Now here

Andrew walks over to the next spot

WOLF
Go

Andrew stands there for a moment

WOLF
Go

ANDREW
I’m trying You turned the water
off It doesn’t just come roaring
back on

Just then a voice

KATE (0S)
Andrew

Andrew turns around and sees Kate approaching He’s
literally caught with his pants down

KATE
What are you doing

ANDREW
Oh I’m glad you’re here ‘cause I
was just

KATE
Peeing

ANDREW
Yes Peeing

KATE
(alarmed)
Why is the wolf out of his
enclosure

ANDREW
(scrambling)
Oh well that’s why I was peeing
See um I was taking the wolf for
some exercise when suddenly he
stepped on a poison toad

KATE
Poison toad

ANDREW
Yes See how much pain he’s in

They both look at the Wolf He’s fine Andrew shoots hima
look and suddenly the Wolf begins whimpering and feigning
terrible pain in his foot

ANDREW
And the only way to stop the pain
is to pee on it - which is what I
was doing
KATE
Oh my God Well go ahead
ANDREW
What
KATE

Urinate on him He’s obviously in
great pain

ANDREW
Uh Yeah

The Wolf shoots Andrew an intimidating look

KATE
Hurry Get the whole leg Really
soak him or the poison will
travel

ANDREW
Uh Okay

Kate turns her back to give Andrew some privacy Andrew
looks at the Wolf trapped in his lie

ANDREW
(sotto to Wolf)
I’m so sorry

We see the urine stream hit the Wolf’s leg soaking it The
Wolf just stares at Andrew loathsomely

SMASH CUT TO
EXT WOLF’S HABITAT - DAY

Andrew is shampooing the Wolf working up a huge lather of
soap and suds

ANDREW
I think we got it

WOLF
(deadly serious)
Rinse and repeat

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - PANDA’S HABITAT - DAY

A flatbed truck carrying a cage with a FEMALE PANDA in it
backs towards the Panda habitat A small crowd of people are
there Kate is directing the truck

KATE
That’s perfect Right there

On the other side of the habitat the free roaming Peacock
walks to the edge of the enclosure and quietly talks to
Sammy the zoo’s male Panda

PEACOCK
Check it out Sammy They’re
bringing you a honey

SAMMY THE PANDA
(Chinese accent)
I know I been alone in a cage for
12 years Now they finally bring
me woman I so happy I so happy
What her name Never mind I
dont care

Kate has positioned the Female Panda’s cage right next to the
entrance of the habitat

KATE
Okay here we go

Kate opens the cage and allows the Female Panda to enter the
habitat

KATE
Sammy this is Ling-Ling Shes
come all the way from Beijing to be
with you Is it okay if she shares
your cage for a little while

Sammy responds by walking over and nuzzling Ling-Ling
affectionately Kate smiles She turns to Trent who is
watching

KATE
Looks good

Trent smiles back and gives her a “thumbs up”
EXT ANIMAL COMMON SPACE - DAY

Andrew is in the back area with several of the animals

ANDREW

Okay so I’ve peed everywhere
LION

Excellent
ANDREW

So now how does this work Is she
just gonna smell it and fall in
love with me ‘Cause if it’s that
easy why am I not in love with the
homeless guy who lives on my
corner

LION
Marking your territory is only the
first step Andrew Now you must
establish yourself as the dominant
male in that territory

ANDREW
The dominant male

ZEBRA
What he’s saying is it’s time to
earn your stripes

PEACOCK
Ruffle some feathers

ELEPHANT
Trunk it up a bit

Everyone looks at the elephant
WOLF
That’s not a saying

ELEPHANT
Well it should be It’s very
descriptive

ANDREW
So what do I do

FROG
To be an Alpha Male you gotta be
big and intimidating like me

ANDREW
But you’re like the smallest guy
here

FROG
Oh yeah

GIRAFFE
(to Andrew)
That’s hot Do that

FLAMINGO
Alright Enough talk

The Flamingo strides forward like an action hero

FLAMINGO
Look you want to be a dominant
male then you’ve got to dominate
You gotta walk into a room and
knock some punk on their butt
That’s how you send a message

ANDREW
I’m not sure I

FLAMINGO
Front and center Let’s go Nancy-
boy

ANDREW
But

FLAMINGO
I said front and center

Andrew hurries over

The animals

again

The Frog suddenly PUMPS UP HIS CHEST with air swelling it
enormously practically TRIPLING HIS SIZE
respond with praise and cheers

FLAMINGO
Now let’s see what you’ve got
C’mon let’s go Head to head
Mano a mano Last man standing

ANDREW
You want me to hit you

FLAMINGO
Me No not me Him

The Flamingo points to the Ram

RAM

FLAMINGO
Good
(quickly)
On your mark Get set Go

The Ram lowers his horns and charges the unprepared Andrew
ramming into his chest

ANDREW
Oooof
- sending him flying backwards onto the ground
FLAMINGO

(shaking his head)
Looks like we’ve got some work to

do
ZEBRA
That’s it I can’t take this
anymore
FLAMINGO
What
ZEBRA

You Acting like a tough guy when
you ain’t nothin’ but a big pink
bird with pipe cleaners for legs

FLAMINGO
First of all I’m light red

ZEBRA
No what you are is pathetic You
call yourself a bird and you can’t
even fly

FLAMINGO
I can fly

ZEBRA
Yeah Go ahead then

All the animals look at the Flamingo

FLAMINGO
I don’t feel like it

ZEBRA
That’s what I thought

Embarrassed the Flamingo marches off

GIRAFFE
Dude that was harsh

ZEBRA
He had it coming

As all the animals start to bicker about what just happened
the Ram walks over to Andrew

Listen kid if you want some
pointers on establishing male
dominance - I’m your ram

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - DAY
Kate is walking with Will

WILL
Why do I have to go to camp

KATE

Will looks unhappy

KATE
Trent’s nephew is visiting him for

INT PANDA HABITAT - AFTERNOON
Sammy is alone with Ling-Ling
SAMMY THE PANDA

Gorilla come running up behind Sammy’s habitat

LION

GORILLA

Sammy gives them a look They seem insistent

SAMMY THE PANDA
(to Ling-Ling)
‘Scuse me one second

Sammy hurries over to the Lion and Gorilla

SAMMY THE PANDA

timing

LION
You can’t do this You have to

SAMMY THE PANDA

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - AFTERNOON
Kate walks with Will They both eating ice cream cones

WILL
Is the mint chip any good

KATE
You better check

Kate smiles and gives Will a big lick of her cone

Up ahead the same three 19 year old Troublemakers from
before are standing in front of the Anteater habitat
shooting spitballs at the family of Anteaters Kate sees
them and gets angry

KATE
Hey Stop that

The Troublemakers look at Kate “caught”

TROUBLEMAKER 1
Sorry We won’t do it again

While the first boy is saying this a second fires another
spitball at the Anteater The Troublemakers laugh

Will looks at his mom nervously Kate tries to take charge

KATE
(to Boys)
I’m going to have to ask you to
leave the zoo Right now

TOUBLEMAKER 2
Yeah well we’re gonna have to ask
you to

Suddenly out of nowhere Andrew COMES CHARGING down the path
He’s wearing a FOOTBALL HELMET Lowering his head like a ram
he slams right into the chest of Troublemaker 1

TROUBLEMAKER 1
Ooooff

-and sends him flying
Nearby behind some foliage the real Ram is watching
proudly

That was a good clean hit

Back at the Anteater habitat Kate and Will are surprised to
see it’s Andrew inside the helmet

KATE
Andrew

WILL
Andrew

Andrew turns to Troublemaker 2 who is a little shocked by
what just happened

ANDREW
I believe the lady asked you to
leave

Troublemaker 2 tries to throw a punch but Andrew blocks it
and HEAD BUTTS him on the FOREHEAD The kid goes down
holding his head

Andrew turns to Troublemaker 3 menacingly The kid TURNS
AND RUNS The other two scramble to their feet and also take
off Kate stares at Andrew impressed

KATE
Wow I usually don’t condone
violence but nice job

ANDREW
This is my territory I’m the boss
here

Andrew reaches down and PULLS A SMALL CHORD that is hanging
out of the bottom of his shirt Suddenly the life vest he
is wearing under his clothes INFLATES in effect puffing up
his chest a la the Puffing Frog Andrew strides off
confidently

WILL
That was awesome

Just then Trent comes around a corner

TRENT
Kate I was looking for you

KATE
Sorry I’ve been with Will

Will turns to his mom

WILL

KATE

Will smiles politely at Trent and heads off

TRENT

KATE
He’s a little nervous about
starting camp

TRENT
It’s tough being the new guy
(then)
I wanted to check on the pandas

KATE

EXT PANDA HABITAT - DAY

Sammy is sitting on one side of the cage Ling Ling is on
the other THEY COULDN’T BE FURTHER APART Kate stands with
Trent stunned

TRENT
What happened

KATE
I don’t know

Kate looks concerned

EXT ZOO - EVENING

Everyone is gone It’s quiet
EXT DOVE’S CAGE - EVENING
A family of doves live in a large outdoor cage The
beautiful young female dove GRACE is talking through the

wire to the Pigeon Jake who’s giving her a red and white
checkered napkin

GRACE THE DOVE
It’s beautiful Jake Where’d you
get it

PIGEON
This restaurant I go to sometimes
I saw it and thought of you

Grace looks at him sweetly

GRACE
Thanks I love it

They are about to rub beaks when suddenly the FATHER DOVE
appears and sees the Pigeon

FATHER DOVE
Hey Get the hell away from my
daughter

The Father Dove comes flying over Jake quickly flies off

FATHER DOVE
And stay away you low-life pigeon
She’s a dove She’s too good for
you

GRACE
Why do you always have to be so
mean to him

Grace flies to the back of the cage The Father watches her
go hurt

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - MAIN ENTRANCE - MORNING

It’s the next day Several yellow camp buses are parked
outside the zoo entrance Children are getting off the
busses boisterous and excited

Trent stands with Kate inside the zoo gates watching

TRENT
I thought having the camp come here
for a field trip might break up
their routine a little - give Will
a better chance to fit in

KATE
(touched)
That was incredibly thoughtful of
you Trent

Kate looks out at the children They are all playing and
horsing around - except for Will who stands alone

KATE
I hope it works

TRENT
Leave it to me

Trent approaches the campers

TRENT
Good morning campers Welcome
I’m Trent Ramsey Director of the
Zoo

Among the boys we see CYRUS 11 Trent’s nephew He’s a good
looking kid who thinks he’s cool Cyrus whispers to a few
campers

CYRUS
That’s my uncle

The campers respond with “Really” and “Cool” etc

TRENT
You’re in for a real treat today
because I’1l be showing you around
the zoo personally Just remember
as we go try and stay close
(MORE )
44

TRENT (contd)
On our last field trip several boys
disappeared We also noticed that
for about a week afterwards the
alligators weren’t hungry at all
Hmmmm
(then )
I’m just kidding That’s a little
zoo humor
(turning to Will)
vight Will Buddy

All the kids turn and look at Will He shrinks at the
attention Watching from a distance Kate looks concerned

TRENT
Alright well let’s begin

EXT ELEPHANT HABITAT —- DAY

Andrew is with the elephants feeding them

ELEPHANT
Sounds like it went bloody well
ANDREW
Well she definitely took notice of
me
ELEPHANT

A man should always project
strength Virility Otherwise you
could end up like that woeful
excuse for a patriarch

Orville indicates the neighboring habitat where the Gorillas
live As usual Stanley has kids crawling all over him

GORILLA
Are you talking about me

ELEPHANT
I most certainly am Youre
supposed to be a powerful male
figure Instead you let those
little heathens run all over you

GORILLA
They’re kids Dumbo they need
love gentleness a little

finesse

ELEPHANT
I’‘1l take strength over finesse any
day

Trent approaches the Elephant habitat followed by the
campers The kids look INCREDIBLY BORED

TRENT
And right over here children we
have our elephants or Loxodonta
Africana Elephants are best known
for their long trunks which
scientists call Anyone Raise
your hand if you know

None of the children raise a hand They couldn’t be more
uninterested

TRENT

That’s right A proboscis Isn’t
that a funny word Pro-bo-scis
Now let’s talk a little about an
elephant’s diet It’s fascinating -
consisting mostly of dry ordinary
grasses

(seeing Andrew)
In fact this is Andrew one of the
manual laborers who feeds the
elephants

(to Andrew)
Andrew tell the children a little
about these dry ordinary grasses

ANDREW
(to kids)
Well the most interesting thing is
they eat so much of the stuff it
creates these big pockets of gas
inside them In fact
(indicating Orville)
-my scientific name for this guy
here is “Fartimus Maximus”

The kids laugh suddenly coming to life

ANDREW
You want to see why

All the kids scream “Yes”

ANDREW
Alright but I’m gonna need a
volunteer

All the kids shoot their hands into the air and shout “Me”
“Pick me” etc

ANDREW
Wow everyone Okay I’1l just
have to pick the coolest looking
kid You

Andrew points to Will All the kids groan with envy as Will
steps forward Andrew helps him into the habitat Will
seems a little nervous

ANDREW
It’s okay Just stay close to me

Andrew walks Will over to the side of the Elephant

ANDREW
(quietly to Elephant)
Move over a little Orville

The Elephant takes a step sideways Will has HEARD this and
looks a little surprised at how the Elephant responded

ANDREW
Alright young man tell everyone
your name

WILL
Will

ANDREW
Okay Will Now put your hand
right there

Andrew places Will’s hand on the side of the Elephant’s
stomach

ANDREW
»-eand push

Will pushes A LONG DEEP FART comes out of the Elephant
The kids love this They squeal with delight

ANDREW
That’s the low register Now try
here

Andrew repositions Will’s hand Will pushes and a much
HIGHER PITCHED FART emanates from the Elephant The kids are
beside themselves with glee

ANDREW
That’s the soprano Which leaves
only one more area The Grand
Daddy of them all But I’m not
sure you guys want to see Will do
that

The kids scream “Do it Will” “Go for it” etc

ANDREW
Okay you asked for it

Andrew places both of Will’s hands below the Elephants
stomach Will pushes Suddenly a HUGE explosion of gas
comes bursting out of the Elephant’s rear with tremendous
force ‘causing his tail to sail up in the air The kids go
crazy with delight

Andrew takes a step towards the back of the habitat and
motions for Will to follow

ANDREW
You might want to get up-wind

WILL
Why
Just then a WAVE OF NOXIOUS FOUL FUMES hits the group of
campers outside the cage They scream in disgust and delight
as they begin to run away in search of fresh air

TRENT
Wait Stay together

Trent runs off chasing after them
Back in the habitat Will is smiling ear to ear

ANDREW
C’mon I’1l let you out the back

Andrew guides Will towards the rear gate

WILL
Thanks for letting me do that

ANDREW
Hey any time you want to help I
can always use a Deputy Zookeeper
Andrew reaches the gate and opens it
WILL
You know you’re pretty cool - for
a grown up

ANDREW
Thanks You’re a pretty cool kid

Will smiles He starts to leave

ANDREW
Hey Will

Will stops

ANDREW
Your mom said it was just you and
her these days Where’s your dad

WILL
He died 3 years ago

ANDREW
Oh I’m sorry

WILL
Me too

They share a moment of silent understanding then Will runs
off Once he’s gone Orville comes over upset

ELEPHANT
Absolutely humiliating

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

The kids are loading back onto the camp busses Will is the
center of attention All the kids clamor around him as he
recounts his experience Cyrus is not enjoying Will’s new
found popularity

CYRUS
(to other camp)
It wasn’t that awesome It was
just an elephant farting

OTHER CAMPER
Dude that’s pretty awesome

Kate stands next to Trent watching Will from a distance
Will’s friends slap him on the back and get on the bus to
leave saying “See you tomorrow” Will looks over at Kate and
smiles happy

KATE
Oh my God look at that smile
Trent I can’t possibly thank you
enough

TRENT
Children are easy You just have
to know how to relate to them

Further back behind some bushes we see several animals
watching

LION
Look at him Taking credit for
everything Andrew did

Back on Trent and Kate

TRENT
Speaking of relating I’ve been
thinking it might be nice for us to
get to know each other a little
better you know outside of “the
office”

KATE
Oh
(then )
Sure That sounds nice

TRENT
Perhaps tomorrow night we could

Suddenly from out of the sky a BLUE PARROT comes STREAKING
DOWNWARD like a dive bomber He let’s go of a GIANT POOP
that falls falls falls and lands directly on TRENT’S
FOREHEAD SPLATTERING all over his face

KATE
Oh God

TRENT
(deeply embarrassed)
Excuse me

Trent hurries away
Back behind the bushes

LION
Impressive aim

ZEBRA
They don’t call him the Blue Baron
for nothing

PEACOCK

falling for that creep do you

The Lion sniffs the air

smell that way

The Elephant raises his trunk and “bugles”

GORILLA
With apes it’s like this

The Gorilla pounds his chest and yells

BIG EARS

Big Ears opens his mouth but NO SOUND comes out

ANDREW

Big Ears points 3 female Big Ears are suddenly at the

window peering in with love struck eyes

LION
They are right Andrew I could
never be the King of Romance
without my love roar Observe how
it whips my women into a frenzy of
lustful fury and desire

The Lion LETS OUT HIS ROAR From off screen we hear his
Lionesses call back

LIONESS (CLAUDIA)

before losing herself to embarrassment and laughing The
crowd cheers Andrew moves to the seal tank

ANDREW

Around you every night

Andrew reaches the seal tank and begins to dance his way up
the big rock in the center of the tank The crowd is totally
with him

builds Kate and everyone else are completely focused on
him Andrew digs in and REALLY GOES FOR IT

Andrew surfaces in the pool feeling foolish He starts to
swim to the side but THE SEALS RUSH OVER They nudge their
new visitor and start playing with him

The crowd starts to LAUGH Andrew tries to fight his way
free but the delighted seals won’t let go They take turns
PUSHING HIM AROUND THE TANK

The CROWD HOWLS AND POINTS Some even take pictures This
is the funniest seal show they’ve ever seen

Trent in fresh clothes approaches the crowd looking around
for Kate He sees her and heads over

Oh God is it noon already Sure

They start to head for the exit Trent never sees that it is
Andrew in the tank

TRENT

KATE
Yeah it was hysterical

Back in the seal tank Andrew climbs up the center rock to
escape the seals As he does he SEES TRENT AND KATE leaving
the zoo together Trent puts his arm around Kate to lead her
out of the gates

Andrew stares in horror - until a seal grabs his pants and
yanks him back into the water The crowd howls again

From behind the bushes several animals are watching aghast

LION
Uh-oh

Trent and Cyrus who won the race come over

TRENT
Nice try guys

for Will here

I’m sure Cyrus wouldn’t mind if I
teamed up with Will for some of the
events

KATE
Oh that would be

WILL
(quickly)
No thanks

Trent looks surprised
KATE
Will

CYRUS
He probably just wants to be with
his mom

Cyrus smiles at Will getting in a dig Kate notices
something

KATE

They all follow Kate’s gaze and see Andrew arriving at the

picnic Will’s eyes light up Trent looks annoyed

TRENT
What’s he doing here

Andrew sees them and starts to head over

TRENT
Andrew you’re supposed to be at
work

ANDREW

(reaching the group)
I know but I heard about the
picnic and

Andrew looks over at Will

ANDREW
-I just thought I’d check to see

A MONTAGE of scenes showing Andrew and Will competing
together in the various events

3-Legged Race

We see Andrew and Will at the starting line tied together at
the leg The starting gun sounds Andrew and Will hobble
forward awkwardly Almost immediately they are passed by
half the field including Trent and Cyrus

Andrew sees what’s happening He puts his arm around Will
and they find a groove They move forward quickly catching
the rest of the race and then just barely beating Trent and
Cyrus at the finish line to win

Andrew and Will high five Kate watches from the sidelines
She smiles

Water Balloon Dodgeball

Andrew and Will are on one side with half the dads and kids
Trent and Cyrus are on the other with the other half The
whistle sounds and everyone starts heaving water balloons at
each other If you’re hit you’re out

TIME DISSOLVE A number of people have been hit Fewer dads
and kids remain

TIME DISSOLVE Another dad gets hit Now it’s just Andrew
and Will versus Trent and Cyrus Andrew lofts a balloon high
in the air While Cyrus is watching it Will picks him off
Trent however responds with a rapid shot - which nails Will

Before he can celebrate however he’s blasted by a balloon
from Andrew

Kate laughs

Water Catapult

A giant plastic inflated float (looks like a huge bean bag
chair) sits on the surface of the lake near the dock A boy
sits on one side of it His father stands atop a platform on
the dock The father jumps down onto the giant float
jettisoning the boy into the air sending him about 20 feet
before he splashes into the water A Counselor in a rowboat
quickly marks the distance

Next up is Cyrus and Trent Trent sends Cyrus flying He
passes all the other marks to take the lead

The last team to go is Will and Andrew Andrew hits the
pillow with considerable force and Will flies into the air
Cyrus watches as Will lands past his mark Everyone cheers

Will pops up from the water and points at Andrew “You the
man” Andrew points back

Kate is on the dock beaming Will swims over to her As he
does Andrew climbs back onto the dock and SNEAKS up behind
Kate He PICKS HER UP Kate pleads but Will encourages
Andrew so Andrew JUMPS INTO THE LAKE with Kate They all
surface laughing Kate playfully splashes Andrew

Trent watches from a distance fuming

up a notch

Behind the Penguin a HIPPO trots in with the nozzle end of a
thick firehose in his mouth

tremendous force The Hippo points it at the tank which
begins to fill very quickly On the other side of the tank a
hyena is watching laughing

LAUGHING HYENA

You know scent is very important
They say in the animal world
everything begins with scent

ANDREW
Yes I’ve heard them say that

KATE
Actually it was Will who chose my
perfume tonight

ANDREW
Will

KATE
He also picked out my earrings My
bracelet

ANDREW
Is he like your stylist

They dance together for a few moments

KATE
No just tonight He he really
wanted tonight to go well

Andrew smiles

ANDREW
He’s a good kid

KATE
He’s an amazing kid

ANDREW
I think he’d be pleased with how
things are going so far

KATE
I think he’d be very pleased

Kate smiles and rests her head on Andrew’s shoulder as they
dance

EXT BALLROOM BALCONY - EVENING

It’s a little later Kate and Andrew are out on the balcony
talking

KATE
It’s always been that way for me
Ever since I was a little girl
I’ve always loved animals

ANDREW
That’s exactly how I was when I was
a kid I mean I wasn’t a little

girl But I loved animals All I
wanted to do was be around them
(then )
I guess that’s why I became a zoo
keeper
KATE
You say that like you regret it
ANDREW
No Not at all I love it It’s
just socially
KATE

Hard to meet chicks

ANDREW
Yeah They think I’m a little
weird

KATE
You are a little weird
(off Andrews look)
But in a good way

Andrew smiles A beat then

KATE
I don’t know why Andrew but I
feel very connected to you

ANDREW
Me too

The energy between them builds They hold each other’s gaze
a little longer than friends would

KATE
I can’t believe I’m falling for the
guy who had camel spit in his
pocket

Slowly Andrew and Kate lean in towards each other TO KISS

ANDREW
(very romantically)
Don’t forget the bat guano

Their lips are just about to meet when Trent suddenly steps
out onto the balcony

TRENT
Kate

Trent sees what’s going on and stops

TRENT
Sorry I didn’t mean to interrupt

KATE
That’s okay

TRENT
I have some news I just heard
back from the London Zoo

KATE
So quickly

TRENT
Yes Apparently they’re very
excited They want Ling Ling The
timing was perfect They just
acquired a male panda and well
they want her right away
KATE
How right away

TRENT
As soon as we can arrange
transport There may even be a
boat tomorrow

KATE
(shocked)
Tomorrow

ANDREW
What’s going on

Kate looks distressed

KATE
I didn’t think this would happen so
fast

ANDREW

What would happen so fast

KATE
Ling Ling and Sammy were fighting
I had to separate them Now it
seems Trent has found her a new
home

TRENT
Just trying to make the best of an
unfortunate situation

ANDREW
Hold on The pandas didn’t mate

Kate shakes her head disappointed

TRENT

When two individuals aren’t right
for each other Andrew obstacles
just naturally arise It’s a sort
of Darwinism I suppose

(then)
Now if you’ll excuse me I better
start making arrangements

(to Kate)
Once this becomes public I’m
afraid the Board will move quickly

Trent exits
ANDREW

The Board What’s he talking
about
KATE
It’s awful but it looks like the
zoo is going to have to close

ANDREW
Close

KATE
It’s been struggling for a long
time Andrew That’s why they
brought in Ling Ling A baby panda
would have attracted thousands of
visitors - it could’ve saved the
ZOO

ANDREW
No one told me any of this

KATE
It’s not exactly the kind of thing
you want to promote

ANDREW
But what about the animals

KATE
Usually they get sold to other
zoos It’s rough though Families
get broken up Children often get
separated from their

ANDREW
No no no This is wrong

KATE
I know it’s horrible but

ANDREW
Ill get the pandas to mate

KATE
They won’t Andrew They’re
completely incompatible Trust me
this is what I do for a living

ANDREW
No they will I’m sure once
they
(then )
I gotta go

Andrew rushes off Kate watches him go confused
EXT ZOO GROUNDS - NIGHT

It’s night All is quiet Andrew comes rushing in

ANDREW
Sammy

The animals see him and look confused

GORILLA

Andrew sprints past the animals and heads for the panda
habitat

EXT PANDA HABITAT - NIGHT

Andrew reaches the Panda habitat Sammy is there alone
looking despondent

ANDREW
Sammy what are you doing

SAMMY THE PANDA
What I doing I sit here alone
twiddling paws That’s what I
doing

ANDREW
Why didn’t you mate with Ling Ling

SAMMY THE PANDA
Because the other animals tell me
not to

ANDREW
What

SAMMY THE PANDA

They say if Ling Ling get pregnant
then Kate gonna leave If Kate
leave then you leave Then
everybody miserable This way only
Sammy miserable And believe me I
so miserable

(then sad)
I miss my Ling Ling

Andrew turns around and sees all the animals who are out of
their cages and have come over to see what’s going on

ANDREW
(to animals)
Who told him to do this
ANTEATER
It was the lion

LION
Don’t point your nose at me

LIONESS
What are you gonna do fill him
with cream and eat him

MACAW
The Gorilla did it too

ELEPHANT
Oh that figures Imposing
discipline on others when he has
none of his own

GORILLA
(to Macaw)
Thanks a lot for ratting me out

RAT
Hey I heard that banana breath
All the animals start arguing with each other

ANDREW
Enough Enough

The animals all go quiet

ANDREW
God I am so sick of all the
bickering You’re all just like
people All you can see are each
other’s weaknesses You make fun
of each other belittle each other
just so you can feel better about
yourselves

The animals are chastened

ANDREW
Who cares who’s got stripes And
who’s pink And who regurgitates
their food so they can eat it
twice Guys this is our home
We’re a family We’re all in this
together And we need to take care
of each other if we’re gonna stay
together

LION
What do you mean stay together

Andrew takes a beat then

ANDREW
Theyre planning on closing the zoo
and selling all of you to different
places

All the animals react with shock and dismay

ANDREW
It’s okay They won’t close it if
there’s a baby panda coming We
just need to get Ling Ling back
Does anyone know where they’re
keeping her

ZEBRA
They took her off site To the
holding facility on Penrose

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT
Kate is looking around Trent approaches

TRENT

KATE

to turn into a pumpkin
(then )
In any case

Trent shows Kate some notes he’s jotted down

TRENT
I found space on a ocean freighter
It leaves tomorrow at 11

KATE
(sadly)
Well I guess I better go home and
start packing

EXT STREETS - NIGHT

Andrew is driving the zoo’s pick-up truck WIDEN TO REVEAL

yard

INT KATE’S HOME - NIGHT

Kate has just arrived home with Trent She’s talking to
Will

KATE

anything about that

KATE
Andrew

WILL

They rush through on their way to the Panda habitat
EXT PANDA HABITAT - NIGHT

Andrew and Ling Ling reach the Panda cage Andrew opens the
door and let’s Ling Ling in

SAMMY THE PANDA

SAMMY THE PANDA
Boy that’s a lotta pressure

ANDREW
You want me to go get the polar
bear

SAMMY THE PANDA
No no I’m good

Suddenly a voice calls out

KATE (0S)
Andrew What are you doing

Andrew turns around and sees Kate and Trent approaching
Several ANIMAL WORKERS are with them A police squad car is
also pulling up
ANDREW
Oh no

KATE
(to animal workers)
Get the female out of there

ANDREW
(under his breath)
You gotta be kidding me

The animal workers head for the cage

ANDREW
Wait Just give them a chance

KATE
No They’re a danger to one
another I want her out Now

The workers enter the cage Andrew moves to Kate

ANDREW
Kate please They’1ll mate
There’s a reason they weren’t doing
it before

KATE
Oh really And what was that

ANDREW
It’s because well

they wanted us to be together

KATE

TRENT
My God he’s insane

Will comes running up

WILL
Listen to him Mom

KATE
Will I told you to stay home

WILL
He knows what he’s talking about
He can speak to the animals

TRENT
My God he’s warped the child too

WILL
(to Andrew)
Tell her
ANDREW
Will

The animal workers begin to lead Ling Ling out of the cage

WILL
You’ve got to Please tell her

KATE
(to animal workers)
Be careful with her She’s
probably very agitated

Andrew approaches Kate

ANDREW
Kate I know how this must look

KATE
Look This is not “look” Andrew
You kidnapped an endangered species
- an animal I’m responsible for
You jeopardized her life bringing
her here And if that wasn’t
enough you manipulated my 10 year
old son into helping you

(disgusted)

The boy respected you Andrew He
looked up to you And you repay
that trust by telling him things
like you can “talk to animals”

Andrew says nothing

KATE
I thought you were someone else
Andrew I was obviously very
wrong

Kate turns to leave

KATE
C’mon Will

Trent turns to the policemen
TRENT
I want him prosecuted Nothing he

did was authorized by the zoo

The policemen move towards Andrew Will rushes over and
grabs Andrew’s arm pleading

WILL
Andrew please

Kate glares at Andrew

ANDREW
It’s okay Will

Andrew gently guides Will back towards his mother Will
watches as the policemen lead Andrew to their squad car and
put him in the back

FADE OUT

I’ve placed “closed” signs on all
the gates Everything is secure

WILL

Trent goes over to Will

TRENT
Will I know it’s upsetting to see
the zoo closing but look at it
this way Everything you have
here youll have back in London

position at the zoo there so you
your mother and I will all still be
together There’ll be all the same

Directors of the zoo I can
personally guarantee you a position
there as a deputy zoo keeper So
you see everything has worked out
wonderfully Now how about a
smile

Will stares at him without smiling
TRENT
There isn’t that better Now

ELEPHANT
We can’t leave the zoo That’s
preposterous We’ve never been
beyond these walls in our lives

Suddenly a powerful voice thunders through the room

POWERFUL VOICE (0S)

Everyone looks over and sees the Lion enter

LION
This man has given everything for

favor We are animals of honor
integrity and most of all
courage And I say we are going

by this impressive show of leadership They call out “Yeah”
He’s right” and “Andrew would do it for us”

cages

ELEPHANT
Everyone stand back

The Elephant reaches up with his trunk GRABS THE BARS and
YANKS THEM OUT of the WINDOW taking a hunk of the facade
along with it The whole mess crashes to the ground

PEACOCK
Damn Now that’s what I call
“trunking it up a bit”

The Elephant turns to the Peacock pleased

ELEPHANT
See It’s catchy isn’t it

Andrew sticks his head out of the hole in the wall and sees
the animals assembled there

ANDREW
What are you guys doing

GIRAFFE

He slides down until he’s sitting on the Giraffe’s back

The animals are about to take off
ANDREW

Wait The pier’s over 2 miles

idling at the red light Andrew rushes over He climbs up
the step to speak to the DRIVER through the passenger window

ANDREW
Excuse me sir We’re kind of ina
crisis here Is there any way you
could drop me and my friends off at
the pier

DRIVER
I’m going the other way pal Now

Just then the Gorilla RIPS THE DRIVER’S DOOR clear off the
truck sticks his head in the cab and ROARS FULL THROTTLE

DRIVER
(petrified to Andrew)
Hop on lLet’s go

flatbed

ANDREW
This way

Andrew leads the animals into one of the abandoned
warehouses

INT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

The animals dash through the large cavernous warehouse In
the rear they are stopped by a large metal gate that prevents
them from heading out onto the pier

PEACOCK
It’s locked

GORILLA
What is it with humans and their
locked gates

ELEPHANT
Stand back I’ve got this

The Elephant backs up to get a running start then comes
CHARGING into the gate He HITS IT WITH THE FULL FORCE of
his body but it DOESN’T GIVE Instead the Elephant bounces
back teeters for a moment and falls

ELEPHANT
Oww

WARTHOG
It’s elephant-proof

ANDREW
(worried)
Stay here I’1l see if theres
another way

Andrew runs out of the warehouse The Giraffe with his long
neck can see over the gate

GIRAFFE
They’re untying the boat dudes
We gotta boogie
ZEBRA
Anybody here know how to work one
of these combo locks
The Zebra indicates the big COMBINATION PADLOCK on the door

WOLF
That would require thumbs

GORILLA
Did someone say “thumbs”

The Gorilla steps forward flexing his fingers

EXT OCEAN FREIGHTER - DAY

The large boat’s huge motors start churning the water though
the boats not moving yet Out on the deck Kate turns to
Will

KATE
You want to go see what the rooms
are like

WILL
That’s okay I’11 stay here

Kate looks concerned

TRENT
He’s fine Let’s give him a little
space

Trent and Kate head inside the boat
INT WAREHOUSEEXT DOCKS - DAY
Andrew comes running back inside out of breath

ANDREW
I couldn’t find another

Andrew stops when he sees the Gorilla holding the
combination lock slowly turning the dial Big Ears has one
of his ENORMOUS EARS pressed against the lock LISTENING
carefully

BIG EARS
Left left left Stop
That’s it

The Gorilla pulls down on the lock It clicks open The
animals cheer The Gorilla turns to the Elephant

GORILLA
(to Elephant)
See Sometimes it is about
finesse

ELEPHANT
Touché

GIRAFFE
They’re shoving off

ANDREW
Let’s go

The animals push the door open and rush out onto the dock
only to see the gangplank has been wheeled back and the boat
is pulling away from the pier

ZEBRA
Uh-oh

Andrew spots A ROPE coiled on the dock The rope is
ATTACHED TO THE BOAT As the boat pulls away the rope is
rapidly UNCOILING

ANDREW
Get that rope

The animals take off for it The Lion the fastest of the
bunch sprints out ahead of the others

As the boat pulls away further the rope uncoils even faster

From the deck of the boat Will looks up and sees Andrew and
the animals charging across the dock

WILL
Andrew
(then excited yelling)
Andrew

As he runs Andrew looks up and sees Will

ANDREW
Will

The rope is almost completely uncoiled At the last minute
the Lion POUNCES on it He grabs it with his mouth and
throws it over the huge 200 lb cleat

LION
I did it We win

The other animals arrive just as the rope goes taught and
RIPS the 200 LB CLEAT RIGHT OUT OF THE DOCK The cleat sails
50 feet through the air before splashing harmlessly into the
water

The animals watch as the giant boat continues on
unperturbed

GIRAFFE
Dude that is so totally bogus

Andrew finally catches up to the animals He looks up and
sees Will Their eyes lock as the boat motors out towards
the sea

GORILLA
I can’t believe this is how it’s
gonna end

LION
If only someone could fly out there
and stop that boat

The Zebra turns and looks at the Flamingo

FLAMINGO
Why are you looking at me

ZEBRA
You could do this You got the
skills and you got the wings

FLAMINGO
Me I can’t fly You know that

ZEBRA
Yes you can You’re a bird And
birds can fly I believe in you
kid

ANDREW
We all believe in you

The Flamingo studies the faces of all the animals staring at
him Slowly and softly the animals begin to chant

EVERYONE
(chanting softly)
Flamin-go Flamin-go Flamin-go

The Flamingo takes a breath then

FLAMINGO
Alright clear a path
(then )
I feel the need The need for
speed

The Flamingo takes several steps backwards as the animals
part creating a lane between them The Flamingo spreads his
wings and

IN SLO MOTION We see the Flamingo charge toward the edge of

the dock flapping his wings as he sprints all out He beats
his wings harder and harder until finally he’s at the edge of
the dock and he JUMPS INTO THE AIR

The animals hold their breath as the Flamingo SAILS UPWARD -
for a brief second - and then QUICKLY DROPS DOWNWARD The
Flamingo descends until his belly GRAZES THE WATER He flaps
his wings frantically to stay aloft inches above the water

It seems like an eternity but FINALLY HIS WINGS CATCH AIR
and he starts to rise again

IN REGULAR MOTION The animals watch from the dock tensely
until they see the Flamingo ascend

PEACOCK
He’s up

Sure enough THE FLAMINGO SOARS INTO THE AIR gaining altitude
as he heads for the boat The animals and Andrew go crazy
cheering wildly

ZEBRA
I knew you could do it Pink I
knew it

Flying out to the boat the Flamingo cries out as he flaps
with all his might

FLAMINGO
Adrian Adrian

EXT OCEAN FREIGHTER - DAY

From the deck Will watches as the Flamingo flies over his
head towards the front upper deck of the ship

INT OCEAN FREIGHTER - BRIDGE - DAY

The BOAT’S PILOT is alone at the helm steering the ship
Suddenly a giant pink bird comes soaring through one of the
open doors and lands a few feet away

BOAT’S PILOT
What the hell are you

FLAMINGO
I’m your worst nightmare A
flamingo with an attitude

BOAT’S PILOT
(stunned)
Huh

FLAMINGO
Yippie kai yay mothersucka

The Flamingo JUMPS UP and delivers a KARATE KID STYLE KICK
right to the Pilot’s chest The Pilot goes FLYING BACKWARDS
hits his head on the wall and sinks to the floor out cold

FLAMINGO
That’s right I’m bad

INT OCEAN FREIGHTER - HALLWAY

Trent is helping Kate open the door to her cabin Suddenly
the boat shifts They stop

KATE
What was that

TRENT
(confused)
Feels like we’re turning around

INT OCEAN FREIGHTER - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The Flamingo is spinning the large steering wheel with his
beak

EXT THE DOCKS - DAY

On the docks the animals see the boat turning around and
heading back towards them

LION
He did it

The animals cheer ecstatic

The Flamingo steps out of the bridge and onto the upper deck
The Zebra calls to him

ZEBRA
You’re a superhero

The Flamingo jumps up on the upper railing and raises his wings

FLAMINGO
I’m the king of the world

The animals all cheer and celebrate The boat keeps coming
towards the dock Andrew calls to the Flamingo

ANDREW
Lenny

FLAMINGO
What

ANDREW

Stop the boat
The Flamingo realizes the boat is motoring right towards the dock

FLAMINGO
Oh right

The Flamingo heads back to the bridge

EXT OCEAN FREIGHTER - DECK - DAY

Kate and Trent come rushing out onto the deck They see Will
and head over to him

KATE
What’s going on

Andrew and the animals are
hijacking the boat

As the boat continues to turn back towards the dock Andrew
and the animals standing on the dock come into Kate’s view

KATE
Oh no

INT OCEAN FREIGHTER - BRIDGE - DAY

Inside the Bridge the Flamingo finds a big red button marked
“Engine Shut Off” He hits it with his beak

FLAMINGO
There

EXT THE DOCKS - DAY

Andrew and the animals watch as the boat still moving pretty
fast continues towards the dock They see the Flamingo step
out of the bridge Andrew calls to him

ANDREW
Lenny stop the boat

FLAMINGO
I turned it off What the hell
else do you want me to do

The boat keeps coming It’s obviously going to crash into
the dock

ANDREW
(to animals)
Everybody back
EXT OCEAN FREIGHTER - THE DECK - DAY

Kate sees what’s about to happen

KATE
Hold on

EXT THE DOCKS - DAY

Andrew and the animals run for the back of the dock as the
ocean freighter smashes into the pier with considerable
force Several animals fall

EXT OCEAN FREIGHTER - THE DECK - DAY

Kate Trent and Will fall to the ground from the impact

EXT THE DOCKS - DAY

The pier holds strong and because the boat hits at an angle
it’s momentum forces it to turn until the side of the boat is
lined up against the dock

The Elephant looks back and sees the boat effectively docked

and the rolling gangplank only yards away He rushes over
and pushes the gangplank up to the boat

ELEPHANT
All aboard

Andrew and the animals rush up the gangplank
EXT OCEAN FREIGHTER - THE DECK - DAY
Kate Will and Trent are still on the ground

KATE
(to Will)
Are you okay

WILL
That was awesome

As they get to their feet the see Andrew and the animals
come rushing down the wide deck towards them

ANDREW
Kate

KATE
Andrew I don’t know what you think
you’re doing but

Suddenly the BOAT’S CAPTAIN and 5 members of his CREW come
running down the deck from the other direction

CAPTAIN
What the hell is going on

TRENT
(pointing at Andrew)
This man is deranged You must
apprehend him immediately

The Captain and his crew head for Andrew The Wolf steps
forward and growls The men stop

TRENT
Don’t be afraid of the animals
They’re perfectly tame

The Wolf snarls and charges the men The men TURN AND RUN
chased by the gnashing Wolf

TRENT
(calling to fleeing men)
Stop Come back Cowards

Just then the Lion steps forward eyeing Trent Trent starts
to back up nervously

TRENT
Easy boy Settle settle
(then
Andrew tell this beast to back
off Now Do it

ANDREW
Get him Francisco

The Lion charges Trent runs and JUMPS over the SHIP’S
RAILING He falls splashing into the water below Will
can’t help but smile at the sight of this

KATE
Andrew are you out of your mind

ANDREW
Kate just listen to me If you
leave right now youll be making a
terrible mistake Not only because

of the zoo but because because
you’re supposed to be here With
me

Andrew looks over at Will Will is smiling beaming really

ANDREW
I love you Kate And deep down I
think you love me And Will and
I We’re all meant to be
together as a family Any idiot

Kate looks confused

ANDREW
I mean not us The animals can

KATE
The animals told you

WILL
Just listen to him mom

Andrew wants to tell Kate the truth He looks over at the
Elephant The Elephant nods permission

ANDREW
(to Kate)
They don’t do it often but when
they want to animals can talk to
humans

A beat then

KATE
Andrew you’re a very sweet man
and Look I admit there was a
moment there where I was hopeful
about us Even standing here right
now there’s a part of me that
wants to believe you That wishes
you weren’t crazy

ANDREW
I’m not crazy Everything I’ve
ever told you is true

KATE
Andrew you just said animals can
talk That’s the definition of
crazy

Fed up the Zebra turns to Kate AND SPEAKS

ZEBRA
Oh for God’s sake just kiss the
guy

Kate freezes She stares at the Zebra in bewilderment The
Peacock chimes in

PEACOCK
You heard the Zebra Plant one on
him

A real kiss So he can feel it in

his toes

Kate is stunned

WILL

The Elephant sneaks forward

ELEPHANT
(hushed whisper)
You can’t tell anyone There’s a
code you know

Kate looks over at Andrew

KATE
Oh my God

ANDREW

first

KATE

So that means

ANDREW

WILL

Kate looks at Andrew Andrew takes her into his arms and
kisses her All the animals cheer The kiss lasts and
lasts

WILL

just getting gross

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - DAY

An absolutely spectacular fall day The Z00 IS PACKED with
visitors of all ages laughing enjoying themselves

As the CAMERA PANS across this idyllic scene we hear the
voice of a TELEVISION NEWS REPORTER

TV REPORTER (VO)
What you’re seeing right now is the
beautiful revitalized Baltimore
ZOO

(MORE )

TV REPORTER (VO) (contd)
It’s hard to believe only a few
short months ago this thriving zoo
was on the verge of shutting down

The CAMERA lands on the Reporter

TV REPORTER
The dramatic turnaround can be
attributed largely to this little
guy right here

The SHOT WIDENS to REVEAL the Panda habitat Inside are
Sammy Ling Ling and AN INCREDIBLY ADORABLE BABY PANDA

A short distance away Kate stands watching Andrew
approaches

ANDREW
I didn’t know we had a TV crew

They kiss Andrew sits on the bench

ANDREW
Boy with moving the monkeys
polishing the rhino’s horn and
then giving the Board members a
tour I haven’t sat down all day

KATE
Are you telling me this as my
husband who wants sympathy or as
the Co-Director of the Zoo who
needs a 5 minute break

ANDREW
As the Co-Director But as your
husband let me just add your
butt looks phenomenal in those
pants

KATE

husband who said that otherwise

Francisco steps on the treadmill Just then a voice
interrupts

Excuse me

Will and Francisco look over A VERY CUTE 10 YEAR OLD GIRL

CUTE GIRL
