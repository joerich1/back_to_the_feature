CHARLIE
--Well originally I was going
to be a concert pianist

CHARLIE (Cont‘d)
And I was really quite good but
when the day was done no
Horowitz So I decided to be an
actor Or a philosopher--I studied
the Great Books at St John’s
I realized Id never really excel
at either of those so I turned
to astrophysics But of course
all the great physicists made
their discoveries before the age
of 25 That just wasn’t in the
cards So I went to the West Bank
and wrote a novel about a
parricide--

FREEDMAN
Excuse me

‘CHARLIE
A boy who kills his father My
Dad liked it quite a lot
actually But it’s not like he
equated it to Hawthorne or
anything It just seemed--do you
know that Johnson remark ‘the
epidemical conspiracy for the
destruction of paper’ I mean
you could fill Yankee Stadium with
all the mediocre novelists in the

world and--

ENRIGHT
Could I ask you a personal
question How much do they pay
you up at Columbia

CHARLIE
Eighty-six dollars a week

ENRIGHT
Do you know how much the average
stockbroker is paid Do you have
any idea what Bozo the Clown

makes

CHARLIE
Well we can’t all be Bozo the
Clown

ENRIGHT

I’m not questioning your choice
of profession--not at all

ENRIGHT (Contd)
I’m questioning the values of a
society that pays somebody like
you--what was it

FREEDMAN
Eighty-six dollars a week

ENRIGHT
Eighty-six dollars a week and
Meanwhile Sputnik’s up there cight
now beep-beep-beeping over our
heads

CHARLIE
I have to admit Mr Enright it’s
a national problem

-ENRIGHT
I understand you came down here
to try out for ‘Tic Tae Dough’

CHARLIE
Well my friends say I have a good
mind for this sort of thing--I’d
been planning a trip to Italy
and- -

ENRIGHT

How would you like to be on ‘21’
“CHARLIE

21°
FREEDMAN

Dan produces both shows

ENRIGHT
You’re young clean-cutFrom
a prominent family You’re exactly
what this country needs Kids
would run to do their homework
so they could be like Charles Van
Doren

CHARLIE
It’s just--what about Herbert
Stempel

ENRIGHT
I love Herbie People dont like
him Kids don’t look up to him

FREEDMAN
If you were a kid would you want
to grow up and be a fat annoying
Jewish guy with a sidewall
haircut

CHARLIE
I wanted to be Joe DiMaggio

FREEDMAN
Especially after he held out for
the hundred grand

ENRIGHT
That’s what this country needs
An intellectual Joe DiMaggio with
the money and the women and all
from this (tapping his head)
instead of a bat and ball

CHARLIE
All that aside--well honestly
I don’t think I can beat him
‘Tic Tac Dough’ seemed more
feasible

Enright thinks a beat Gazes out the window

ENRIGHT
What if we were to put you on the
show--put you on ‘21’ this
Wednesday- -and ‘ask you ‘questions
you know Say the questions you
already answered correctly on your
test this morning

CHARLIE
What do you mean I thought the
questions were in a bank vault

ENRIGHT
Forget about that I’m just
thinking out loud

CHARLIE
Seriously

ENRIGHT
You want to win don‘t you

CHARLIE
I think I’d really rather try to
beat him honestly

FREEDMAN
What‘s dishonest Its not like
wed be giving you the answers

CHARLIE
I don’t see the difference

FREEDMAN
We ask you a question you know
the answer Just because we know
you know you still know

ENRIGHT
It’s not like putting me on the
show or Al and pretending I’m
some intellectual Youve put in
the time years of study and
erudition

‘CHARLIE
(wondering)
I’m just trying to imagine what
would Kant think of this

FREEDMAN
I really don’t think hed have
a problem with it

ENRIGHT
Nobody would ever have to know
Justus three Think of what you’d
accomplish for the cause of
education

CHARLIE
It just doesn’t seem right Id
have to say no

ENRIGHT
Just an idea

An awkward beat as they all look at each other

think people are tired of that
whole ‘GI college student’ thing
Frankly I’m tired of it myself
And that disgusting suit--I mean
that’s gotta be half of it--

nature of the show Theyve
already seen you win Theyre
bored with it

championship away--you have to
zetz me in front of the entire
country

a judge would seal it
Goodwin points to a small HEADLINE on an inside Page

straight--‘21 is fixed

HERBIE
You‘re so naive Of course it’s
fixed It’s a fix it’s all a fix
A set-up

GOODWIN
That’s unbelievable

HERBIE
Do--you think ‘that’ big blond putz
would be on the show 13 weeks
without somebody spoon-feeding
him the answers

Herbie tears into the rugalach

GOODWIN
Youre saying Charles Van Doren
is given the answers in advance

HERBIE
They made me take a dive--did you
know that ‘Marty’ They told me
I had ‘plateaued’--that the
ratings had ‘’plateaued’

TOBY
A sinking ship and the rats
stayed

64 HERBIE
Would they tell me to take a dive
and not give him the answers
It’s not logical

GOODWIN
Then it’s purely inferential

HERBIE
There’s nothing inferential about
it You think theyd give me the
answers who didn’t even need the
answers and not give the Big Goy
the answers

GOODWIN
They gave you the answers

SURPRISED Toby shoots him a look--this is the first she’s heard
of it An awkward PAUSE filled with the sound of Lesters
drumming

HERBIE
Would you please go inside and
tell Gene Krupa to take five

Toby gets up goes inside Herbie resumes

GOODWIN
Herb--why would you admit that
they gaveyou the answers

HERBIE
Exactly Exactly That‘s the
difference between me and Charles
Van Doren--J admit it I have
my morality

GOODWIN
I want to get this straight--they
made you take a dive after giving
you the answers

HERBIE
I just wanted the money--frankly
to get out from under the
financial thumb as it were of
my in-laws I didn’t put myself
up to the world as the Crown
Prince of Education I didn’t
parade myself on the cover of
Time That‘’s why you have to nail
him

64 GOODWIN
This isn’t McCarthyism

HERBIE
Listen--think about what
McCarthyism did for McCarthy

GOODWIN
I‘m not here to nail anyone

HERBIE

I’m just saying--don’t make
necessarily the mistakes that I
might have made in life Think
about your career You nail Van

statement proclaiming his
innocence

GOODWIN
He’s not going to do that

SANDRA
You‘re going to look like a jerk

GOODWIN
Why would he do that I told him
Co keep his mouth shut

SANDRA
I still dont know why he’s not
going to testify

GOODWIN
I just told you why The hearings
are circumscribed by legislative
Purpose The legislative purpose
18 to reform television not to
reform Charles Van Doren

SANDRA
Don’t patronize me

GOODWIN
I wouldn’t patronize you if youd
pay attention It’s the same as
the an cases
when I was at The Court

SANDRA
If you don’t want to answer just
don’t answer Dont give me a lot
of legal bullshit

GOODWIN
I don’t see any need to drag the
man into the spotlight and
tidicule him

SANDRA
You’re dragging Herb Stempel into
the spotlight

GOODWIN
Herbie doesn’t need to be dragged
into the spotlight believe me

™ SANDRA
Nobody forced Van Doren to go in
front of 50 million People either

111 GOODWIN
At least he has the good sense
to keep his mouth shut

SANDRA
Good sense or good breeding

GOODWIN
Oh for Crying out loud He made
a mistake

SANDRA

You know Dick you’re ten times
the guy Charles Van Doren is ten
times the brain ten times the
human being and meanwhile
the one bending over backwards
for him Youre like the Uncle
Tom of the Jews

GOODWIN
Im glad it’s so easy for you to
destroy a man’s life I‘ll keep
it in mind

I participated from October 17

Generally I would receive the
questions and answers on Tuesday
typed up

CHAIRMAN
And the show aired when

HERBIE
Wednesday We’d have a sort of
rehearsal on Wednesday afternoon

CONGRESSMAN 1
A rehearsal

HERBIE
There was a great deal of
histrionics involved for the show
to proceed the way Mr Enright
planned it

CONGRESSMAN 1
Mr Stempel what do you mean by
‘rehearsal’

HERBIE
Well for example he told me how
to breathe heavily into the
microphone and sigh such as
this (Herbie sighs) He taught
me how to stutter and say in a
plaintive voice ‘I will take
nine nine points’

CHAIRMAN
So it was all choreographed

HERBIE
How to bite my lip How to mop
my brow--he told me specifically
not to smear my brow but rather
to pat for optimum effect Of
course I’m shvitzing the whole
time because they turned off the
air conditioning

CHAIRMAN
Excuse me

was one way out and that was
simply to tell the truth 1
