1 STREET EXT DAY

FOUR PUPPETEERS emerge from among skyscrapers They enter a
nondescript building on a side street

2 ABANDONED BUILDING INT DAY

In a dark room a big table is covered in sand bits of brick
imitation trees and boulders

The PUPPETEERS go to work - efficiently unload a carry-all
filled with FIGURINES squeezy bottles of ketchup fireworks

etc

They distribute the FIGURINES - KNIGHTS KINGS SOLDIERS
COWBOYS INDIANS GODZILLA

LIGHTS ILLUMINATE THE TABLE

And the room goes dark

SOUNDS OF BATTLE ARE HEARD

As the PUPPETEERS manipulate the FIGURINES in WAR

Cries of horses screams of maimed men exploding bombs

The PUPPETEERS employ a set of TINY VIDEO CAMERAS at table-top
level the resulting scenes of the HORRORS OF WAR are projected

on a video screen

A hand manipulates the PUPPET OF THE KING As the VOICE OF THE
KING is heard

KING’S VOICE
Speak man Hath fortune given us victory

Another hand manipulates the GENERAL PUPPET

GENERAL’ S VOICE
Victory my liege And that with little loss --

BOOM A MISSILE lands and blows TEN PUPPETS apart

3 TABLETOP BATTLEFIELD EXT DAY

The KING OF SPAIN his GENERAL CASTILE - the KING’s brother -
and HIERONIMO a courtier stand in front of the IMAGES OF THE
PUPPET BATTLEFIELD

The KING and CASTILE high-five each other while behind them
MORE PUPPETS ARE MURDERED CASTILE drops his gloves
HIERONIMO falls to one knee picks them up and hands them
back

HIERONIMO
My lord

The NOBLES ignore him

KING
Then bless’d be heaven and guider of the heavens
From whose fair influence such justice flows

BOOM Another missile lands behind them Much ketchup

The KING and CASTILE hug each other in their joy The GENERAL
puffs up his chest with pride HIERONIMO still on one knee
wipes away a tear

KING
Thanks to my loving brother of Castile
But General unfold in brief discourse
Your form of battle and your war’s success

GENERAL
Where Spain and Portugal do jointly knit
On every side drop Captains on the ground
And soldiers lie maimed some slain outright -

Again TOYS and STUFFED ANIMALS flee and are shot in the back
by SOLDIERS

GENERAL
Here falls a body sundered from his head
There legs and arms lie bleeding on the grass
Mingled with weapons and unbowelled steeds

Body parts and the HORSE from “Guernica” are seen
GENERAL

In all this turmoil three long hours and more
The victory to neither part inclined
Till Don Andrea with his brave Lancers -

They stand over the PUPPET BOARD watching the COWBOY and
INDIAN PUPPETS of DON ANDREA and his LANCERS

GENERAL
- in their main battle made so great a BREACH
That half-dismayed the multitude retired
But BALTHAZAR the Portuguese young Prince -

His excitement increases He grabs the BALTHAZAR puppet out of
a PUPPETEER’s hand

ANGLE ON THE BALTHAZAR PUPPET - A splendid suit of armour with
an enormous breastplate spiked shoulders like an Ankylosaurus
and a plume

HIERONIMO rises to his feet to admire the PUPPET

GENERAL
- brought rescue and encouraged them to stay
Here hence the fight was eagerly renewed
And in that conflict Andrea was slain -

Unable to restrain his blood-lust the GENERAL smashes the
ANDREA and LANCER PUPPETS with the BALTHAZAR PUPPET

GENERAL
- brave man-at-arms but weak to Balthazar
Yet while the Prince insulting over him
Breathed out proud vaunts sounding to our reproach
Came forth HORATIO our Knight Steward’s son -

He claps HIERONIMO on the shoulder HIERONIMO swells with
pride

GENERAL
- To challenge forth that Prince to single fight

The GENERAL indicates the pile of PUPPETS HIERONIMO grabs the
PUPPET representing his SON

ANGLE ON THE HORATIO PUPPET

In white armour with long flowing locks on a white horse
HIERONIMO enthusiastically participates in the action -

GENERAL
Not long between these twain the fight endured
But straight the Prince was beaten from his horse
And forced to yield him prisoner to his foe

The KING and CASTILE turn away arm in arm their thoughts on
the tribute they will inevitably receive

KING
Thanks good Lord General for this good news

The GENERAL nods fixated on the PUPPETS HIERONIMO does
battle with his HORATIO PUPPET The HORATIO and BALTHAZAR
PUPPETS in their fight stamp the ANDREA PUPPET deeper into
the mud

GENERAL
When he was taken all the rest they fled
And our carbines pursued them to the death

LIGHTING EFFECT on the SMOULDERING PUPPET-BATTLEFIELD

GENERAL
Till Phoebus waving to the western deep
Our trumpeters -

KING
(turning back impatient to GENERAL)
But tell me now have you confirmed a peace

GENERAL
(running after him)
No peace my liege But peace conditional -
That if with homage tribute will be paid
The fury of your forces will be stayed

The KING beckons to HIERONIMO
KING
Hieronimo
Now Knight Steward frolic with the King
For tis thy son that wins the battle’s prize
HIERONIMO holds up the beautiful PUPPET of his son
HIERONINO
Long may he live to serve my sovereign liege
And soon decay unless he serve my liege

ANGLE ON THE KING

Disappearing into the dark
KING
Nor thou nor he shall die without reward

HIERONIMO wipes the tears from his eyes This is his
apotheosis He sets the PUPPET carefully down and follows
the KING

HOLD ON THE SMOKING PUPPET TABLE

A BLACK HOOD and a COWBOY HAT slowly rise behind it to reveal
REVENGE and the GHOST OF ANDREA

REVENGE is a mysterious figure whose features cannot be clearly
seen

ANDREA’S GHOST is dressed a mud-drenched cowboy outfit
perforated with bullet holes streaked with blood

ANDREA stares at the whole scene in disgust

REVENGE delves into the mud to find ANDREA’s mud- and blood-
stained PUPPET He waves the PUPPET at ANDREA

REVENGE
You were a courtier in the Spanish court
Your name was Don Andrea your descent
- Though not ignoble - yet inferior far

4 BEL-IMPERIA’S BOUDOIR INT DAY

BEL-IMPERIA’s SERVING MAIDS are braiding her hair with pearls
as she stares fixedly at ANDREA’s framed picture tears falling
silently down her cheeks

ANDREA and REVENGE enter the room But they are GHOSTS unseen
and unnoticed

ANDREA
- To gracious fortunes of my tender youth
For there by dutious service and deserving love
In secret I possessed a worthy dame
sweet BEL-IMPERIA

He hurries to her puts his hands on her breasts kisses her
neck She doesn’t notice him REVENGE pulls him away

A DOOR flies open Another MAID runs in in tears bearing a
newspaper BEL-IMPERIA and her MAIDS are like characters in a
silent film their voices lost to us and to the GHOSTS
BEL-IMPERIA reads the newspaper and wails silently She storms
out followed by her ENTOURAGE

ANDREA squints at the paper

HEADLINE KILLER OF DON ANDREA COMES TO COURT KING WELCOMES
PRINCE BALTHAZAR

REVENGE
Know now Andrea that thou art arrived
Where thou shalt see the author of thy death
Don Balthazar the Prince of Portugal
Deprived of life by Bel-Imperia

The warlike ANDREA is delighted at the prospect of his beloved
murdering his killer REVENGE beckons to him

CuT TO --

5 COURT INT DAY
A grand corridor

REVENGE and ANDREA stand adjacent to a bench seat An excited
hubbub in the air REVENGE immediately curls up on the bench

REVENGE
Here Sit we down to see the mystery
And serve for Chorus in this Tragedy

SWISH PAN TO --

5A BALTHAZAR still clad in his magnificent suit of spikey
armour being marched along by his captors -

- the noble HORATIO with flowing hair and handsome features

- and the sleazy LORENZO a degenerate rich kid Like BEL-
IMPERIA he too has pearls in his hair And looks just like
her only nastier

You might expect HORATIO to be the alpha male here But
though a better warrior and genuine babe magnet he is
basically LORENZO’s servant LORENZO being the nephew of the
KING

6 WINE CELLAR INT DAY

- where HIERONIMO is preparing WINES for the KING to sample in
preparation for the Victory Banquet

A GUARD rushes in

GUARD
My liege The warlike Prince of Portugal

HORATIO and LORENZO march BALTHAZAR in The KING savours a
glass of wine Then spits it out

KING
A gladsome sight And by our nephew
in triumph led
(he notices HORATIO)
But who is he that holds him by the arm
As partner of the prize

HIERONIMO
That’s my son my gracious sovereign

KING
(greeting BALTHAZAR and LORENZO)
Welcome Don Balthazar Welcome nephew
(to HORATIO)
And thou er -

HIERONIMO
Horatio sire

KING
Horatio Thou art welcome too

BALTHAZAR
The trespass that my father made in peace
Is now controlled by fortune of the wars
The cards once dealt it boots not ask why so

He raises his manacled wrists goes down on one knee before
the KING LORENZO yanks on BALTHAZAR’s chains

KING
Ay Balthazar Well said
Our peace will grow the stronger for these wars
(he sees both LORENZO and HORATIO
are holding BALTHAZAR’s chains)
But tell me for their holding makes me doubt
To which of these two art thou prisoner
LORENZO
To me my liege

HORATIO
To me my sovereign

They both grab hold of BALTHAZAR LORENZO is particularly
clingy BALTHAZAR doesn’t seem to mind

LORENZO
This hand first took his horse’s reins

HORATIO
But first my lance did knock him from his horse

LORENZO
I seized his weapon and enjoyed it first

LORENZO and BALTHAZAR enjoy a private moment Belatedly
LORENZO waves BALTHAZAR’s sword around

HORATIO
After I forced him lay his weapons down

KING
Let go his arms
(LORENZO and HORATIO release BALTHAZAR)
So worthy Prince to which one did you yield

BALTHAZAR
(indicates LORENZO then HORATIO)
To him in courtesy to him by force
He promised life this other threatened death
He won my love this other conquered me
And truth to tell I yield myself to both

HIERONIMO
But though I know your grace is just and wise
My tongue should plead for young Horatio’s right -
In first by nature and by law of arms

KING
Content thee Steward thou shalt have no wrong
And for thy sake thy son shall want no right
Will both abide the censure of my doom

LORENZO
I crave no better than your grace awards
HORATIO
Nor I although I sit beside my right

KING
You both deserve and both shall have reward
Nephew you took his weapon and his horse
His weapons and his horse are your reward
Horatio you did force him first to yield
His ransom therefore is your valour’s fee

ANGLE ON HORATIO
pleased with the outcome
ANGLE ON LORENZO
all hissy and dejected
KING
But nephew you shall have the Prince in guard
For your estate best fitteth such a guest
How likes Don Balthazar of this device
BALTHAZAR
Right well my liege if this proviso were
That Don Horatio bear us company -

Whom I admire and love for chivalry

KING
Horatio leave him not that loves thee so

The KING finishes the wine tasting Exeunt BALTHAZAR LORENZO

and HORATIO
KING
Now let us hence to see our soldiers paid

And feast our prisoner as our friendly guest

7 COURT INT DAY

Preceded by SACKBUTTS LORENZO and BALTHAZAR and their
ATTENDANTS march back down the grand corridor HORATIO is
close behind

REVENGE is asleep on the bench ANDREA watches the parade
intently

Up ahead BEL-IMPERIA appears Wringing her hands with grief
and anger

In a little GUARD BOOTH several GUARDS are drinking tea and
watching TV - news of the death of DON ANDREA and the arrival
at court of PRINCE BALTHAZAR

ANGLE ON LORENZO

Excited at the sight of the distraught BEL-IMPERIA

LORENZO
My sister

ANGLE ON HORATIO AND BALTHAZAR

Both smitten by BEL-IMPERIA’s extraordinary beauty and energy

They both step forward LORENZO pushes HORATIO back

LORENZO
Not you This is the king my uncle’s niece
Sister What means this melancholy walk

BEL-IMPERIA
That for a while I wish no company

LORENZO
But here -
(he grabs BALTHAZAR pulls him forward)
- a PRINCE is come to visit you

BEL-IMPERIA with a look of hatred sweeps past them both
She drops her glove

HORATIO
Madam your glove

She keeps going HORATIO bows to the Princes and hurries
after her

7G ANGLE ON ANDREA
Attempting to wake REVENGE asleep on the bench
LORENZO comforts the crestfallen armour-plated BALTHAZAR
LORENZO
My lord be not dismayed for what has passed

You know that women oft are humourous
These clouds will overblow with little wind

CuT TO --

8 ROSE GARDEN EXT DAY

BEL-IMPERIA paces a whirlwind of fury surrounded by flowers
HORATIO enters the garden carrying the glove

Though the principal images are black and white the FLOWERS
are brilliantly multi-coloured

BEL-IMPERIA
So good Horatio this is the place and hour
Wherein I must entreat thee to relate
The circumstances of Andrea’s death -
Who living was my garland’s sweetest flower
And in his death has buried my delights

She grabs a rose then yanks it off the bush The thorns dig
in her hand Her hand bleeds

HORATIO is horrified

HORATIO
Madam --

BEL-IMPERIA
(she waves him away)
Would you had slain him that so slew my love

HORATIO
Their fight was long their hearts were great
Their clamours menacing their strength alike
Don Balthazar with ruthless rage
Did finish what his halberdiers begun
And left not till Andrea’s life was done

BEL-IMPERIA
And was Andrea’s carcass lost

Breathing heavily in the heady rose-scented garden they are
attracted to each other in spite of themselves

HORATIO
I took him up and wound him in my arms
And welding him unto my private tent
There laid him down and dewed him with my tears
I saw him honoured with due funeral
This scarf I plucked from off his lifeless arm -
From his jacket he pulls a BLOOD-RED SCARF She grabs it

HORATIO
I wear it in remembrance of my friend

BEL-IMPERIA
I know the scarf would he had kept it still
And worn it for his Bel-Imperia’s sake
For ‘twas my favour at his last depart

She lets go of the scarf They are NEARLY IN EACH OTHER’S
ARMS

BEL-IMPERIA
But now wear it both for him and me

They almost kiss He becomes aware that he still has her
glove

HORATIO
Your glove --

She draws back Both cough remembering themselves

BEL-IMPERIA
Thanks good Horatio Take it for thy pains

Overwhelmed HORATIO backs out of the bower and makes off
clutching the scarf and glove

BEL-IMPERIA sits down on a stone bench
REVENGE materialises with his transparent head in her lap
ANDREA’S GHOST approaches her

BEL-IMPERIA

Ay go Horatio Leave me here alone
For solitude best fits my cheerless mood

(towards ANDREA’S GHOST)
Had he not loved Andrea as he did
He could not sit in Bel-Imperia’s thoughts
But how can love find harbour in my breast
Till I revenge the death of my beloved
Yes second love shall further my revenge
I’11 love Horatio my Andrea’s friend
The more to spite the Prince that wrought his end

The GHOST of ANDREA tries to wake REVENGE REVENGE is actually

awake and watching BEL-IMPERIA with an amused expression

BEL-IMPERIA rises and walks out of the bower She walks
straight through ANDREA’s aghast GHOST REVENGE laughs at
ANDREA

9 ROYAL LAVATORY INT DAY

LORENZO and BALTHAZAR misbehave LORENZO wears makeup and a
quasi-military uniform with many medals BALTHAZAR has an
enormous dinner jacket and kilt over his breastplate and body
armour

HORATIO bursts in bows

HORATIO
The King my lords is coming hither straight
To feast the Portuguese Ambassador

BALTHAZAR
Then here it fits us to attend the King
To welcome hither our Ambassador
And learn my father’s and my country’s health

10 BANQUET HALL INT NIGHT

SACKBUTTS sound as the KING and the AMBASSADOR enter followed
by everyone in order of royal and national status

LORENZO switches the place settings to put HORATIO far away
and BALTHAZAR next to BEL-IMPERIA who has not yet appeared

The KING draws the AMBASSADOR’s attention to LORENZO’s
solicitousness

KING
See Lord Ambassador how Spain entreats
Their prisoner Balthazar
We pleasure more in kindness than in wars

AMBASSADOR
Sad is our King and Portugal laments
Supposing that Don Balthazar is slain

BALTHAZAR
So I am slain -
(sneezes as BEL-IMPERIA enters)
- by beauty’s tyranny
You see my lord how Balthazar is slain

He sneezes again BEL-IMPERIA’s manservant PEDRINGANO pulls
her chair out for her But she won’t sit next to BALTHAZAR
PEDRINGANO makes another GUEST move so she can sit as far away
as possible

BALTHAZAR
I frolic with the Duke of Castile’s son
Wrapped every hour in pleasures of the court
And graced with favours of his majesty

He bows to the KING to CASTILE and to LORENZO

The KING nods sits and invites the AMBASSADOR to sit beside
him The AMBASSADOR being next most senior present sits
The KING nods to BALTHAZAR who’s blowing his nose

KING
Sit down young Prince you are our second guest
Brother sit down And nephew take your place
And thou Horatio wait thou upon our cup -

A WAITER thrusts a tray of drinks into HORATIO’s hands
HORATIO starts serving the august dignitaries especially
BALTHAZAR and LORENZO who are very thirsty

BEL-IMPERIA and HORATIO look at each other look away then
sneak ANOTHER LOOK

KING
- for well thou hast deserved to be honoured
Now lordlings fall to Spain is Portugal
And Portugal is Spain We both are friends
Tribute is paid and we enjoy our rights
But where is old Hieronimo our Steward

ANGLE ON HIERONIMO
In evening dress with modest medals stepping forward

HIERONIMO
Here I am sire

The KING rises puts a large chain of office over the
overwhelmed HIERONIMO’s head HIERONIMO falls to his knees

KING
Frolic Hieronimo Thou art now confirmed
Marshall of Spain by all the dues
And customary rights unto thy office

HIERONIMO
My knee sings thanks unto your highness’ bounty
Come hither boy Horatio fold thy joints
Kneel by thy father thank my liege
For honouring me thy mother and thyself
With this high chain of office

HORATIO has his work cut out for him He has to kneel down and
serve the drinks and deal with his burgeoning desire for BEL-
IMPERIA who casts him smouldering looks

HORATIO
Oh my liege I have a heart thrice stronger
than my years
And that shall answer gratefully for me
If ever you have foes or red field scars

I’11 empty all my veins to serve your wars
I’1l1 bleed for you

BEL-IMPERIA rises in her seat eyes sparkling at his brave
words HORATIO looks not at the KING but at her This is not
lost on LORENZO

HIERONIMO
Well spoke my boy

KING
Ay and no doubt his merit will purchase more
Knight Marshall rise And still rise
Higher and greater in thy sovereign’s eyes

LORENZO
Oh fortunate hour blessed minute happy day

10G PULL BACK TO REVEAL THE GHOST OF ANDREA AND REVENGE
Watching from the foreground Beyond BALTHAZAR stuffs his
face and toasts LORENZO

ANDREA
Came we for this from depth of underground
To see him feast that gave me my death’s wound
These pleasant sights are sorrow to my soul
Nothing but league and love and banqueting

REVENGE
Be still Andrea

REVENGE watches as HIERONIMO kisses his son

REVENGE
I’11l turn their friendship into fell despite
Their love to mortal hate their day to night
Their hope into despair their peace to war
Their joys to pain their bliss to misery

11 WIDE SHOT OF THE CITY EXT NIGHT

The lights of the Spanish Capital go out

12 HIERONIMO’ S HOUSE EXT NIGHT

A modest house set among gardens behind high walls

13 HIERONIMO’ S BEDROOM INT NIGHT

HIERONIMO is already asleep He still wears his chain of
office His wife ISABELLA turns out the bedside light

HIERONIMO smiles in his sleep He clutches his new chain

14 LORENZO’ S CHAMBERS INT NIGHT

BALTHAZAR’s manservant SERBERINE prepares flavoured vodka
drinks for his master and LORENZO The two PRINCES consume
drugs off a silver tray

SERBERINE himself is drunk and quite forward

BALTHAZAR
(sentimentally drunk sobbing)
Oh On that perfection all my thoughts attend
On whose aspect my eyes find beauty’s bower
In whose translucent breasts --

LORENZO
My lord though Bel-Imperia seem thus coy
Let reason hold you in your wonted joy
She in time will fall from her disdain -

BALTHAZAR
No She is wilder and more hard withall
Than beast or bird or tree or stony wall
But wherefore blot I Bel-Imperia’s name
It is my fault not she that merits blame (CONT )

BALTHAZAR (CONT )
(he looks at himself in the mirror)
My feature is not to content her sight
My words are rude and work her no delight
My presents are not of sufficient cost
And being worthless all my labour’s lost
Yet might she love me as her brother’s friend -

SERBERINE
Ay but her hopes aim at some other end
(drinks)

BALTHAZAR
Yet might she love me to uprear her state

SERBERINE
Ay but perhaps she hopes some nobler mate
(drinks)

BALTHAZAR
Yet might she love me as her beauteous thrall
(forestalls SERBERINE’s response
with a dirty look)
Ay but I fear she cannot love at all

ALL DRINK
ANGLE ON LORENZO

Rising as a young PAGE enters The PAGE wears a TEDDY BEAR
BACKPACK LORENZO falls on the backpack and pulls out more
drugs
LORENZO
My lord for my sake leave these ecstasies
And doubt not but I’11 find some remedy

LORENZO pours more drugs onto the tray The PAGE leans against
his leg He tousles the PAGE’s hair

LORENZO
Some cause there is that lets you not be loved
First that must needs be known and then removed

SERBERINE
What if your sister loves some other knight

BALTHAZAR
My summer’s day will turn to winter’s night
LORENZO
My lord for once you shall be ruled by me
Hinder me not what ere you hear or see

He goes to the window and looks out shouts to someone below

LORENZO
Ho Pedringano

15 LORENZO’ S CHAMBERS EXT NIGHT

PEDRINGANO BEL-IMPERIA’s servant is crossing the Quadrangle
below LORENZO’s window He stops

PEDRINGANO
Sir

LORENZO
Ven qui presto

LORENZO throws a handful of coins at PEDRINGANO PEDRINGANO
scoops them up and hastens up the stairs

16 LORENZO’ S CHAMBERS INT NIGHT
LORENZO finishes the drugs on the silver tray

LORENZO
By force or fair means will I cast about
To find the truth of all this question out

ANGLE ON PEDRINGANO

Entering breathlessly He is taken aback by the sight of
MASTERS so familiar with their SERVANTS

PEDRINGANO
Hath your lordship any service to command me

LORENZO
Ay Pedringano Service of import
It is not long thou knowest
That I did shield thee from my father’s wrath
In thy connivance in Andrea’s love
I stood betwixt thee and thy punishment

PEDRINGANO falls to one knee in gratitude

PEDRINGANO
‘Tis true my lord

LORENZO
And since thou knowest how I have favoured thee
Now to these favours I will add reward
Tell truth - and have me for thy lasting friend

PEDRINGANO
What ere it be your lordship shall demand
My bounden duty bids me tell the truth

LORENZO
Whom loves my sister Bel-Imperia
For she reposeth all her trust in thee
Speak man and gain both friendship and
gold coins
I mean whom loves she in Andrea’s place

PEDRINGANO
Alas my lord since Don Andrea’s death
I know not if she loves or no

LORENZO
Nay if thou dally then I am thy foe

He draws his knife puts it to PEDRINGANO’s throat
BALTHAZAR and SERBERINE think this is funny

He twists

LORENZO
Thy death shall bury what thy life conceals
Thou diest more esteeming her than me

PEDRINGANO
Oh stay my lord

LORENZO
Yet speak the truth and I will pardon thee

PEDRINGANO
If Madame Bel-Imperia be in love -

LORENZO
What villain Ifs and ands

the knife draws RED BLOOD

PEDRINGANO
Oh stay my lord she loves Horatio
BALTHAZAR starts back

BALTHAZAR
Horatio He is my destined plague
First in his hand he brandished a sword
And with that sword he gave me dangerous wounds

They all stare at BALTHAZAR as he drunkenly attempts to
indicate his wounds He has none

BALTHAZAR
And by those wounds he forced me to yield
And by my yielding I became his slave

LORENZO
Where words prevail not violence prevails
But gold doth more than either of them both

He lowers the knife hands PEDRINGANO more gold He points
PEDRINGANO at a big gold cross on the wall with a miniature
skeleton nailed to it

LORENZO
Swear on this cross that what thou sayest
is true

PEDRINGANO

I swear by him that made us all

BALTHAZAR
(still raging)
Horatio’s mouth doth carry pleasing words
Which sly deceits smooth Bel-Imperia’s ears

LORENZO
Let’s go my lord your staying stays revenge
Do you but follow me and gain her love
Her favour must be won by his remove

LORENZO hands BALTHAZAR a weapon The PAGE opens the door

SERBERINE
How likes Prince Balthazar this stratagem

BALTHAZAR
Glad that I know the hinderer of my love
Glad that I know on whom to be revenged

SERBERINE
Sad that she’1l fly you if you take revenge

LORENZO
Yet must he take revenge or die himself

The PAGE and SERBERINE push BALTHAZAR towards the door

BALTHAZAR
For love resisted grows impatient

He exits waving his sword

LORENZO grins at the SERVANTS and follows

17 HIERONIMO’S GARDEN EXT NIGHT

HORATIO waits impatiently in his father’s garden under the
full moon The creak of a gate in the wall

ANGLE ON BEL-IMPERIA

Even more beautiful by moonlight Her MAID gives her bejeweled
hair a last fluff and then leaves

HORATIO
Now madam since by favour of your love
Our hidden smoke is turned to open flame -

They kiss passionately

BEL-IMPERIA
My heart sweet friend is like a ship at sea
Possession of thy love’s the only port
Wherein my heart with fears and hopes long tossed
Each hour doth wish and long to make resort

They kiss again He tears at her clothes

ANGLE ON ANDREA’S GHOST AND REVENGE

Watching by moonlight ANDREA groans and steps forward tries
to embrace BEL-IMPERIA as well REVENGE pulls him back Love
is for the living not the dead

So obsessed is he that unlike REVENGE he fails to notice
PEDRINGANO leading BALTHAZAR LORENZO and the rest towards the

bower

ANDREA turns away from the sight of his lover with his friend
The OTHERS draw their knives
18 CASTILE’S PALACE INT NIGHT

Beneath a huge gilt-framed portrait of CASTILE on the Golf
Course surrounded by golfing trophies the KING the
AMBASSADOR and CASTILE drink port

SERVANTS decant old vintages and crack walnuts

KING
Brother Castile what says your daughter
to Prince Balthazar’s love

CASTILE
Although she coys it as becomes her kind
Yet henceforth shall she follow my advice
Which is to love him - or forgo my love

KING
Then Lord Ambassador of Portugal
Advise thy King to make this marriage up
I know no better means to make us friends

AMBASSADOR
Here here

KING
I’1l1 grace her marriage with an uncle’s gift
Her dowry shall be large and liberal
And if by Balthazar she have a son
He shall enjoy the Kingdom after us

AMBASSADOR
I’1l1 make the motion to my sovereign liege
And work it - if my counsel may prevail

The KING turns to CASTILE

KING
Now brother you must take some little pain
To win fair Bel-Imperia from her will
This Prince is amiable and loves her well
If she neglect him and forgo his love
She both will wrong her own estate and ours

They raise their glasses and toast

CASTILE
Young virgins must be ruléd by their friends

ANGLE ON THE SERVANTS

Rolling their eyes

19 HIERONIMO’S GARDEN EXT NIGHT

HORATIO and BEL-IMPERIA vigorously make love against a trellis
The flowers all around them glow brilliantly

ANDREA continues in agony at this REVENGE continues amused
He pulls ANDREA away from the sight -

- past an outraged LORENZO and a dispirited BALTHAZAR peering
through the gate

HORATIO
Come Bel-Imperia let us to the bower
And here in safety pass a pleasant hour

BEL-IMPERIA
I follow thee my love and will not back
Although my fainting heart controls my soul

HORATIO
What means my love

BEL-IMPERIA
I know not what myself
And yet my heart foretells me some mischance

HORATIO
Sweet say not so fair fortune is our friend
And heavens have shut up day to pleasure us

BEL-IMPERIA
Thou has’t prevailed I’11 conquer my misdoubt
And in thy love and counsel drown my fear -

HORATIO
Put forth thy hand
That it may combat with my ruder hand

BEL-IMPERIA
Set forth thy foot to try the push of mine

HORATIO
But first my looks shall combat against thine

He kisses her

BEL-IMPERIA
Then ward thyself I dart this kiss at thee

HORATIO
Thus I retort the dart -

ANGLE ON LORENZO BALTHAZAR AND SERVANTS
Pulling on Balaclavas
ANGLE ON THE GHOSTS
Watching
ANGLE ON THE LOVERS
In each other’s arms
BEL-IMPERIA
O let me go for in my troubled eyes
Now may you read that life in passion dies
HORATIO
O stay a while and I will die with thee

So shall you yield and yet have conquered me

The LOVERS COME WITH A GREAT SHOUT
The GATE CREAKS

HORATIO
Who’s there

Enter LORENZO BALTHAZAR SERBERINE and PEDRINGANO disguised
BALTHAZAR stumbles against the gate

HORATIO recognises LORENZO in spite of his disguise
HORATIO
(confused)

Lorenzo

LORENZO runs at HORATIO and stabs him HORATIO staggers back
BEL-IMPERIA screams

SERBERINE and PEDRINGANO throw a rope around HORATIO’s neck

BEL-IMPERIA
O save his life and let me die for him

LORENZO tries to hold his sister back he calls to BALTHAZAR

LORENZO
My lord away with her take her aside

But BALTHAZAR runs at the struggling HORATIO and stabs him
too

HORATIO
What will you murder me

BALTHAZAR
Ay and thus These are the fruits of love

LORENZO
O sir forbear your valour is already tried

He calls BALTHAZAR back the two of them fight to subdue BEL-
IMPERIA SERBERINE and PEDRINGANO haul the bleeding HORATIO
up the trellis with the rope

LORENZO
Quickly dispatch my masters

PEDRINGANO heaves on the rope SERBERINE stabs the strangling
HORATIO

BEL-IMPERIA
O save him brother Save him Balthazar
I loved Horatio But he loved not me

BALTHAZAR falls to his knees before her as HORATIO dies

BALTHAZAR
But Balthazar loves Bel-Imperia

She slugs LORENZO and breaks free and runs to HORATIO’s body

BEL-IMPERIA
Murder Murder Help Hieronimo help

LORENZO
Come stop her mouth Away with her

PEDRINGANO and SERBERINE grab BEL-IMPERIA and gag her
BALTHAZAR kisses her hand

LORENZO gazes up at HORATIO’s hanging corpse
LORENZO
Although his life were still ambitious proud
Yet is he at the highest now he’s dead
LORENZO follows the others from the bower
ANGLE ON HIS PAGE
In close-up chewing his teddy-bear backpack’s ear in horror
and excitement

20 HIERONIMO’ S HOUSE INT NIGHT

HIERONIMO in dressing gown and chain of office comes
downstairs carrying a torch

HIERONIMO
What outcries pluck me from my naked bed
And chill my throbbing heart with trembling fear
Which never danger yet could daunt before
Who calls Hieronimo Speak Hear I am
No answer He goes to the front door and opens it
ANGLE ON ISABELLA
At the top of the stairs

ISABELLA
Hieronimo

HIERONIMO
I did not slumber Therefore t’was no dream
No no It was some woman cried for help -

He goes out -

21 GARDEN EXT NIGHT
- and approaches the walled bower
HIERONIMO
- and here within this garden did she cry

And in this garden must I rescue her

His torch light wipes across the trellis and the hanging
corpse
HIERONIMO
But stay what murderous spectacle is this
A man hanged up and all the murderers gone
And in my bower to lay the guilt on me

This place was made for pleasure not for death

He grabs a pair of garden shears and cuts the body down

HIERONIMO
Those garments that he wears I oft have seen
Alas it is Horatio my sweet son
O was it thou that called me from my bed
O speak if any spark of life remain
I am thy father who hath slain my son
What savage monster not of human kind
Hath here been glutted with thy harmless blood
O heavens why made you night to cover sin
By day this deed of darkness had not been
O poor Horatio what had’st thou misdone
To lose thy life ‘ere life was new begun
O wicked butcher whatsoe’er you wert
How could you strangle virtue and desert
Ay me most wretched that have lost my joy
In losing my Horatio my sweet boy

ANGLE ON ISABELLA entering the bower

ISABELLA
(shrieking)
What world of grief My son Horatio
O where’s the author of this endless woe

HIERONIMO does not answer

ISABELLA
Hieronimo sweet husband speak

CLOSE IN ON HIERONIMO

HIERONIMO
He supped with us tonight frolic and merry
And said he would go visit Balthazar
At the Duke’s palace There the Prince
doth lodge

ANGLE ON A SERVANT

Racing into the bower with a torch JACQUES too discovers

HORATIO’s body

HIERONIMO
He had not custom to stay out so late
He may be in his chamber Go and see

ISABELLA
Ay me he raves Sweet Hieronimo

HIERONIMO
Besides he is so generally beloved
His Majesty the other day did grace him
With waiting on his cup These be favours
Which do assure me he cannot be short-lived

ISABELLA
Sweet Hieronimo -

HIERONIMO
I wonder how this fellow got his clothes
Jacques run to the Duke of Castile’s presently
And bid my son Horatio to come home

I and his mother have had strange dreams tonight

Do you hear me sir

JACQUES
Ay sir

HIERONIMO
Well begone

JACQUES doesn’t move HIERONIMO points at the body

HIERONIMO
Knowest thou who this is

JACQUES
Too well sir

HIERONIMO
Too well who Who is it
(ISABELLA sobs overcome with grief)
Peace Isabella

JACQUES
It is my lord Horatio

HIERONIMO
Ha ha but this doth make me laugh
That there are more deluded than myself

JACQUES
Deluded

HIERONIMO
Ay I would have sworn myself within this hour
That this had been my son Horatio -
His garments are so like

ISABELLA
O would to God it were not so

HIERONIMO
‘Were not’ Isabella Doest thou dream it is
Can thy soft bosom entertain a thought
That such a deed of mischief can be done
On one so poor and spotless as our son
Away I am ashamed

ISABELLA approaches him lays her hand on his arm

ISABELLA
Dear Hieronimo cast a more serious eye
upon thy grief

HIERONIMO
It was a man sure that was hanged up here
A youth as I remember I cut him down

JACQUES shines his torch on the blood-stained trellis

HIERONIMO
If it should prove my son now after all
Let me look again -

He grabs the torch and shines it on HORATIO’s face

HIERONIMO
O God confusion mischief torment
death and hell
Drop all your stings at once in my cold bosom
That now is stiff with horror Kill me quickly
Let me not survive to see the light
May put me in the mind I had a son

ISABELLA
O sweet Horatio O my dearest son

HIERONIMO
How strangely had I lost my way to grief
Sweet lovely rose ill-plucked before thy time
HIERONIMO (CONT )
Fair worthy son not conquered but betrayed
I’1l kiss thee now for words with tears are
stained

He kisses his son’s corpse just as he kissed the living
HORATIO

Breaking away he finds ANDREA’s scarf sticking to him fresh
with HORATIO’s RED BLOOD

HIERONIMO
See’st thou this handkerchief besmirched
with blood
It shall not from me till I take revenge

HIERONIMO wraps the bloody scarf around his neck

ISABELLA
The heavens are just murder cannot be hid
Time is the author both of truth and right
And time will bring this treachery to light

HIERONIMO
See’st thou those wounds that yet are
bleeding fresh
I’11 not entomb them till I have revenged

ANDREA and REVENGE enter the frame

HIERONIMO
Come Isabella now let’s take him up
And bear him in from out this cursed place

The GHOSTS watch as HIERONIMO ISABELLA and JACQUES carry
HORATIO’s body to the house

It is almost dawn A church bell rings
HORATIO’S GHOST appears staring after its own corpse

ANDREA
(to REVENGE)
Brought thou me hither to increase my pain
I looked that Balthazar should have been slain
But ‘tis my friend Horatio instead
And they abuse fair Bel-Imperia
On whom I doted more than all the world
REVENGE
Thou talkest of harvest when the corn is green
The end is crown of every work well done
The sickle comes not till the corn be ripe
Be still - and ‘ere I lead thee from this place
I’11 show thee Balthazar in heavy case

22 LORENZO’ S CHAMBERS INT DAWN

By the rosy light of dawn an ORGY is in progress - LORENZO
SERBERINE PEDRINGANO the PAGE all in the throes of depravity
and loud thumpity music with WHITE CARTONS of half-consumed
TAKE OUT FOOD scattered about

To spare us the details the camera remains on BALTHAZAR
passed out snoring noisily on the sofa

TILT UP TO --

23 GUEST ROOM INT DAWN

- where BEL-IMPERIA is imprisoned She tries the door It’s
locked Goes to the window It’s barred and too far down to
the street below

Loud music thumps from the party room beneath her floor

She goes through the drawers and cupboards looking for some
method of escape Finds a BIBLE Throws it against the wall
in frustration The spine breaks and all the pages fall out
She has an idea -

24 SAME SCENE MOMENTS LATER

BEL-IMPERIA dumps the pot-pourri from a glass bowl She sets
the bowl on the floor pulls off her blood-stained dress and
wrings it out into the bowl

ANGLE ON THE BOWL

Filling with blood

ANGLE ON BEL-IMPERIA

Dragging a dried flower from another bowl breaking off the
head and sucking blood into the hollow stem like a straw
ANGLE ON A PAGE FROM THE BIBLE

The blood-filled straw describing letters on it

25 STREET EXT MORNING

HIERONIMO hurries down the street He is distracted talking
to himself

HIERONIMO
O eyes no eyes but fountains filled with tears
O life no life but lively form of death
O world no world but mass of public wrongs
Confused and filled with murder and misdeeds
He shouts at the PASSERS-BY
TWO DUSTMEN tap their foreheads

SWISH PAN TO --

26 GUEST ROOM INT MORNING

BEL-IMPERIA spies HIERONIMO below She shouts to him but th
traffic noise is too distracting She seizes THE NOTE written
on a page from the Bible weights it down with pearls from her
hair and throws it through the open window

27 STREET EXT MORNING

ANGLE ON THE NOTE

Weighted falling landing on a GUTTER above HIERONIMO’s head
He fails to notice

27A ANGLE ON REVENGE

Sitting on the rooftop beside the NOTE He picks it out and
lets it fall again Yawns and goes back to sleep

27B ANGLE ON HIERONIMO
Looking up --

HIERONIMO
Oh sacred heavens

-- as the note falls past him He bends to pick it up

e
HIERONIMO
If this unhallowed deed
Shall unrevealed and unrevenged pass
How should we term your dealings to be just

He sees the letter is addressed to him
Begins to open it The pearls fall out

He reads aloud the words written in blood

HIERONIMO
“For want of ink receive this bloody writ
Me hath my hapless brother hid from thee
Revenge thyself on Balthazar and him
For these were they that murderéd thy son
Hieronimo revenge Horatio’s death
And better fare than Bel-Imperia doth”

HIERONIMO is astonished He lowers the letter
Stares at the DUKE OF CASTILE’s mansion up ahead

HIERONIMO
What can I gather to confirm this writ
Well harkening near the Duke of Castile’s house
I’11 close with Bel-Imperia if I can
To listen more but nothing to betray

He passes the GUARDS who knowing him well salute and enters
the courtyard of --

28 CASTILE’S PALACE EXT DAY

-- as PEDRINGANO hungover emerges from a staircase

HIERONIMO
Now Pedringano

PEDRINGANO
What Oh Now Hieronimo

HIERONIMO
Where’s thy lady

PEDRINGANO
I know not err here’s my lord

LORENZO appears from the stairs Also hungover he wears dark
glasses and a clean white shirt
HIERONIMO

LORENZO
How now who’s this Hieronimo

HIERONIMO
My lord

PEDRINGANO
He asketh for my lady Bel-Imperia

LORENZO
What to do Hieronimo
(casually)
The Duke my father hath
Upon some disgrace removed her hence awhile
If it be aught I may inform her of
Tell me Hieronimo I1’11 let her know

HIERONIMO
(back-pedals)
Nay nay my lord I thank you there’s no need
I had a suit unto her but too late
And her disgrace makes me unfortunate

LORENZO
Why so Hieronimo Use me

HIERONIMO
Oh no my lord I dare not It must not be
I reserve your favour for a greater honour
This is a very toy my lord a toy

LORENZO
All’s one Hieronimo Acquaint me with it

HIERONIMO
In truth my lord it is a thing of nothing
(turns away mutters to himself)
The murder of a son or so
A thing of nothing my lord

LORENZO
What What’s that
(no response shrugs)
Why then farewell

hurries away

HIERONIMO
My grief no heart no tongue can tell
LORENZO stares after HIERONIMO suspicious

LORENZO
(to himself)
This sly enquiry of Hieronimo
For Bel-Imperia breeds suspicion
And this suspicion bodes a further ill

He beckons to PEDRINGANO leads him to the inner courtyard

LORENZO
Come hither Pedringano Saws’t thou this

PEDRINGANO
My lord I saw it and suspect it too

LORENZO
This is that damnéd villain Serberine
That hath I fear revealed Horatio’s death

PEDRINGANO
My lord he could not ‘Twas so lately done
And since he hath not left my company

LORENZO
Yet fear or flattering words may make him false
I know his humour and therewith repent
That ‘ere I used him in this enterprise
But Pedringano to prevent the worst
And ‘cause I know thee secret as my soul
Here for thy further satisfaction
take thou this

LORENZO hands PEDRINGANO more gold

29 INNER COURTYARD EXT DAY

Above them HIERONIMO reappears From his perch he can see
LORENZO but is too far to hear what’s said He draws back so
that LORENZO and PEDRINGANO do not observe him

LORENZO
Harken to me thus it is disguised
This night you must and prithee so resolve
meet Serberine in Saint Luigi’s Park
You know where it is hard behind the house
There take your stand and see you strike him sure
For die he must if we both mean to live
PEDRINGANO
(weighing the gold)
But how shall Serberine be there my lord

LORENZO
Let me alone I’11 send to him to meet
The Prince and me where you must do the deed

PEDRINGANO
It shall be done my lord It shall be done
And I’1l1 go arm myself to meet him there

LORENZO
Then shall you mount for this that knows
my mind

PEDRINGANO hurries off

ANGLE ON HIERONIMO

Watching as LORENZO dials a number on his mobile phone
He pulls the LETTER from his pocket studies it

HIERONIMO
My son slain by Lorenzo and the Prince
What cause had they Horatio to malign
Or what might move thee Bel-Imperia
To accuse thy brother had he been the means

ANGLE ON LORENZO’S PAGE
Running up He too is exhausted and hungover

PAGE
My lord

LORENZO
Go sirrah and wake Serberine
And bid him forthwith meet the Prince and me
At Saint Luigi’s Park behind the house
This evening boy

PAGE
I go my lord

LORENZO
But sirrah let the hour be eight o’clock
Bid him not fail
PAGE
I fly my lord

The PAGE takes off
ANGLE ON HIERONIMO watching

HIERONIMO

Hieronimo beware Thou art betrayed
And to entrap to life this trail is laid
Advise thee therefore be not credulous

(puts the letter away)
This is deviséd to endanger thee
That thou by this Lorenzo should accuse
And he for thy dishonour done should draw
Thy life in question and thy name in hate

ANGLE ON LORENZO
Dialing another number on his mobile

LORENZO

(into phone)
Is that the Watch
Upon precise commandment from the King
I bid you strongly guard Luigi’s Park
At eight o’clock tonight

(rings off)
The place where Pedringano
This night shall murder hapless Serberine
As for myself I know my secret fault
And so do they But I have dealt with them

He hears a noise and turns - but instead of HIERONIMO
the bloody GHOSTS of ANDREA and HORATIO are staring at him
He doesn’t see them

LORENZO
And better ‘tis that base companions die
Than by their life to hazard our good haps
I’1l trust myself myself shall be my friend
For die they shall Slaves are ordained
to no other end

He marches off between the GHOSTS

ANDREA tries to wake the sleeping REVENGE who pushes him
away
30 ST LUIGI’S PARK EXT NIGHT

This scene is shot entirely from above by multiple
surveillance cameras with time code

A walled alley behind the park
SERBERINE stands waiting against the wall

SERBERINE
Here Serberine attend and stay your pace
For here did Don Lorenzo’s page appoint
That you by his command should meet with him
(shivers)
How fit a place if one were so disposed
Methinks this corner is to close with one

HIGH SURVEILLANCE ANGLE
On a little beaten-up car approaching
31 CAR INT NIGHT

PEDRINGANO at the wheel He parks pulls his PISTOL out of his
pants Looks at the money LORENZO has given him

PEDRINGANO
Now Pedringano bid your pistol hold
And hold on Fortune Once more favour me
Here is the gold this is the gold proposed
It is no dream that I adventure for
I know if need should be my noble lord
Will stand between me and ensuing harms

He gets out of the car

PEDRINGANO
Besides this place is free from all suspect
Here therefore will I stay and take my stand

32 SECURITY POST INT NIGHT

SEVERAL WATCHMEN stare at the security camera screens
St Luigi’s Park including PEDRINGANO and SERBERINE
is clearly seen

WATCHMAN 1
I wonder much to what intent it is
That we are thus expressly charged to watch

WATCHMAN 2
‘Tis by commandment in the King’s own name

WATCHMAN 3
But we were never wont to watch and ward
So near the Duke his brother’s house before
WATCHMAN 2
Content yourself Watch close there’s
something in it
33 ST LUIGI’S PARK EXT NIGHT
ANGLE ON CCTV CAMERAS

Adjusting position for a better view

CCTV -- PEDRINGANO tracked by cameras above approaches
SERBERINE

PEDRINGANO

There sits the bird that I must seize upon

Now Pedringano or never play the man
SERBERINE

(relieved)
Ho Pedringano
I wondered that his lordship stayed so long -
PEDRINGANO shoots SERBERINE

PEDRINGANO
So there he lies My promise is -

Suddenly SECURITY VEHICLES arrive from both directions

PEDRINGANO trapped beside the body of his victim is
immediately apprehended by the WATCH

35 LORENZO’ S CHAMBERS INT NIGHT

BALTHAZAR is still asleep in the same position in the same
spot snoring

LORENZO paces nervously checking his mobile phone for
messages his pager the light on the answering machine

BALTHAZAR stirs

BALTHAZAR
How now my lord What makes you rise so soon

LORENZO
Fear of preventing our mishaps too late

BALTHAZAR sits up He looks around for coffee or another
drink Tries to make LORENZO’s espresso machine work

LORENZO
Touching the death of Don Horatio

We are betrayed to old Hieronimo

BALTHAZAR
Betrayed Lorenzo Tush it cannot be -

He realises the machine isn’t plugged in Searches around
for the plug a socket

LORENZO opens the door to his rooms suddenly

LORENZO
But here’s the PAGE

The PAGE leaning against the door to listen tumbles in

LORENZO
How now what news with thee

PAGE
My lord Serberine is slain

BALTHAZAR
Who My man Serberine

LORENZO
(low voice)
Who murdered him

PAGE
(same)
Pedringano

BALTHAZAR gives up on the coffee machine and throws his arm
around LORENZO

BALTHAZAR
Is Serberine slain that loved his lord so well
Injurious villain Murderer of his friend

He wanders back toward the coffee machine falls instead onto
the sofa and passes out again

LORENZO goes to the drawer of his armoire Grabs a HANDFUL OF
MONEY

LORENZO
Boy go convey this purse to Pedringano
And be advised that none be there about
Bid him be merry still but secret
Bid him not doubt of his delivery

LORENZO secretively hovers over a piece of paper Seizing
a WHITE TAKE-OUT CARTON he dumps out the contents - fortune
cookies - puts the paper in and hands it to the PAGE

LORENZO
Tell him his pardon is already signed
Show him this box Tell him his pardon’s in it
(PAGE looks at the CARTON curiously)
But open’t not and if thou lovest thou life
(warningly)
And sirrah see that this is cleanly done

PAGE
I go my Lord I run

He exits BALTHAZAR turns muttering in his sleep LORENZO
goes to the coffee machine It works easily for him

36 A WINDING STAIR INT NIGHT

As the PAGE clatters down dangling the TAKEOUT CARTON from his
finger his curiosity overwhelms him

PAGE
My Master hath forbidden me to look in this box
By my troth tis likely if he had not warned me

PAGE (CONT )
I should not have had so much idle time They
that are most forbidden will soonest attempt

He gives up his struggle Opens the box pulls out the PAPER
COMPLETELY BLANK He peers into the BOX

PAGE

By my bare honesty here’s nothing but the bare
empty box Were it not a sin against secrecy
I would say this were a piece of gentleman-like
knavery I must go to Pedringano and tell him
his pardon is in this box

(shoves the empty BOX in the BACKPACK)
I would have sworn it had I not seen the contrary

(he continues on his way very cheerful)
I cannot choose but smile to think how the
villain will flout the gallows scorn the
audience and descant on the hangman -- all
presuming his pardon from hence

He shakes his BACKPACK takes out a CIGGIE and lights it with
a satisfied air

PAGE
Will’t not be an odd jest for me to stand and
grace every joke he makes pointing my finger
at this box

(points to TEDDY BEAR)

as if to say mock on here’s thy warrant
Is it not a scurvy jest that a man should joke
himself to death

He LAUGHS and DISAPPEARS DOWN THE STAIRS

37 MAGISTRATES’ COURT INT DAY

HIERONIMO in his new position as MARSHALL presides in
MAGISTRATE’S ROBES and CHAINS The DEPUTY and HANGMAN enter
with PEDRINGANO bound and carrying a LETTER between them

HIERONIMO
(to himself)
Thus must we toil in other men’s extremes
That know not how to remedy our own

DEPUTY
Worthy Hieronimo your office asks
A care to punish such as do transgress

HIERONIMO
Bring forth the prisoner

The PAGE enters WAVES at PEDRINGANO points animatedly at his
BACKPACK

PEDRINGANO
(relieved)
Gramercy Boy but it was time to come
For I had written to my Lord anew
For fear his Lordship had forgotten me

HIERONOMO
Stand forth thou monster murderer of men
Confess thy folly and repent thy fault
For there’s the place of execution

He points to the GALLOWS An imposing structure that resembles
the trellis on which HORATIO was hung

PEDRIGANO looks at the PAGE who pulls the CARTON from his BACK
PACK and tosses it about

PEDRINGANO
Sure I confess nor fear I death therefore
I am the man Twas I slew Serberine

HIERONIMO
For blood with blood shall while I sit as Judge
Be satisfied and the Law discharged
Dispatch the fault approved and confessed
And by our law he is condemned to die

BOOM He STAMPS a paper with his SEAL

HANGMAN
Come on sir are you ready

The PAGE tosses the CARTON from hand to hand leering knowingly
at PEDRINGANO

PEDRINGANO
Oh sir you are too forward Sirra doest thou
see yonder boy with the box in his hand

ANGLE ON THE PAGE pointing at the BOX

HANGMAN
What he that points to it with his finger
PEDRINGANO
Ay

The HANGMAN prepares PEDRINGANO for hanging

PEDRINGANO
What has he in that box as thou thinkest

HANGMAN
Faith I cannot tell nor I care not greatly

PEDRINGANO and the PAGE exchange A-OK signs as the HANGMAN
arranges the NOOSE around PEDRINGANO’s neck

His work completed HIERONIMO goes to the weeping WIDOW OF
SERBERINE their two CHILDREN and his PARENTS

HIERONIMO
O monstrous times when murder’s set so light
O bloody monster God forbid
A fault so foul should scape unpunished
Dispatch And see the execution done

PEDRINGANO
Nay soft no haste

HIERONIMO

This makes me to remember thee my son

The PAGE opens the CARTON turns it over

NOTHING

The HANGMAN does his job PEDRINGANO swings the PAPER he held

HIERONIMO changes from his MAGISTRATE’S ROBES He adjusts his
BLOOD-STAINED SCARF in the mirror

The HANGMAN worried enters carrying the PAPER

HANGMAN
Oh Lord sir the man sir
Petergade sir He that was so
full of merry conceits

HIERONIMO
Well what of him

HANGMAN
Sir the fellow had a fair commission
to the contrary Here is his passport
I pray you sir if we have done him wrong

He hands him PEDRINGANO’s letter

HANGMAN
You will stand between the gallows and me sir

HIERONIMO
Ay ay

HANGMAN
I thank your lord worship

He exits bowing HIERONIMO opens the letter As he does so
the GHOST OF PEDRINGANO appears behind him its neck broken
the noose still tight The GHOST reads aloud --

PEDRINGANO’S GHOST
“My Lord I write as my extremes required
That you would labour my delivery
If you neglect my life is desperate
And in my death I shall reveal the truth
You know I slew SERBERINE for your sake
And was confederate with the Prince and you
Won by rewards and hopeful promises
I helped to murder DON HORATIO too”

HIERONIMO appalled realizes the TRUTH

HIERONIMO
What have I heard What have mine eyes beheld
Now see I what I dared not then suspect
That Bel-Imperia’s letter was not feigned
Now may I make compare twixt hers and this

He pulls out BEL-IMPERIA’s LETTER and compares the TWO
PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

The GHOSTS - ANDREA HORATIO SERBERINE PEDRINGANO gathered
around a sleeping REVENGE But now when ANDREA shakes him
REVENGE WAKES UP

HIERONIMO
Oh false Lorenzo Are these thy flattering looks
Is this the honour that thou didst my son
And Balthazar bane to thy soul and me
Woe to thy birth thy body and thy soul
Thy cursed father and thy conquered self

HIERONOMO paces staring intently the STATUE OF JUSTICE and
the BUSTS OF FORMER GREAT JURISTS that decorate the cloakroom

HIERONIMO
But wherefore waste I mine unfruitful words
I will go plain me to my Lord the King
And cry aloud for justice through the court
Justice and blood will satisfy my woes

He goes out led by REVENGE and followed by the GHOSTS

39 LORENZO’ S CHAMBERS INT DAY

BALTHAZAR ties a foulard atop his white golfing outfit in

One of the SWAT MEN staggers back out bleeding

LORENZO listens ushers BALTHAZAR ahead of him

41 GUEST ROOM INT DAY

BALTHAZAR and LORENZO enter the room step over the broken
water carafe to where the THREE SURVIVING SWAT MEN are pinning

BEL-IMPERIA
What means this outrage that is offered me
Why am I thus sequestered from the Court

LORENZO
Now sister -

BEL-IMPERIA
Sister no
Thou art no brother but an enemy

LORENZO
Advise you better Bel-Imperia
I sought to save your honour and mine own
BEL-IMPERIA
My honour Why Lorenzo wherein is’t
That I neglect my reputation so
That you or any need to rescue it

LORENZO
Why then remembering that old disgrace
Which you for Don Andrea had endured
And now were likely longer to sustain
For being found so meanly accompanied -

BEL-IMPERIA
(screams)
Andrea oO Andrea That thou saw’st
Me for thy friend Horatio handled thus
And him for me thus causeless MURDERED

LORENZO tries to cover her mouth She bites him

Look on thy love behold young Balthazar

Whose passions by thy presence are increased
BEL-IMPERIA

Brother you are become an orator

Your Prince is meditating higher things

BEL-IMPERIA
Accursed brother Unkind murderer
Why bends thou thus thy mind to martyr me
(shouts out the window)
Hieronimo Why writ I of thy wrongs
Or why art thou so slack in thy revenge

She sits down amid the wreckage

BEL-IMPERIA
Well force perforce I must constrain myself
To patience and apply me to the time
Till heaven as I’ve hoped shall set me free

44 GOLF LINKS EXT DAY
HIERONIMO walks across the golf course distracted

HIERONIMO
Hieronimo ‘tis time for thee to trudge
Now then perhaps I come and see the King
The King sees me and fain would hear my suit

He reaches the top of a small hill and sees the KING and
CASTILE’s golf carts with SECURITY MEN all around and
BALTHAZAR thrashing away in a sand trap

HIERONIMO
This way I’1l take And this way comes the King

He hurries towards them The golf carts pull up at the next

ANGLE ON THE KING AND THE AMBASSADOR teeing off

AMBASSADOR
Renownéd King he hath received
Thy Kingly love and kindly lets thee know
First for the marriage of his Princely son
With Bel-Imperia thy belovéd niece
No news is more delightful to his soul
Thus will he give his crown to Balthazar
And make a Queen of Bel-Imperia

CASTILE has noticed the commotion surrounding HIERONIMO
He watches it uneasily out of the corner of his eye

KING
Brother how like you this

CASTILE
I’m much indebted to his Grace
That bends his liking to my daughter thus

AMBASSADOR
Now last dread Lord here has his Highness sent
- Although he send not that his son return -
His ransom due to Don Horatio

HIERONIMO
Horatio Who calls Horatio

KING
And well remembered Thank his Majesty
Here see it given to Horatio

ANGLE ON HIERONIMO

Crying out Behind him the GHOSTS and REVENGE are seen
coming down the hill

HIERONIMO
Justice O justice Justice gentle King

KING
Who’s that Hieronimo
(distracted by CASTILE’s shot)
Nice swing

HIERONIMO
Justice o justice O my son my son
My son - whom naught can ransom or redeem

LORENZO
(hissing at him)
Hieronimo you are not well advised

HIERONIMO
Away Lorenzo Hinder me no more
For you have made me bankrupt of my bliss
Give me my son you shall not ransom him

He grabs LORENZO’s golf club and starts hacking at the earth

HIERONIMO
Away I’11 rip the bowels of the earth
And bring my son to show his deadly wounds
I’1l here surrender up my Marshalship
And I’11 go marshall up the fiends in hell
To be avengéd on you all for this

The KING is appalled at the desecration of his Golf Course
KING
What means this outrage

Will none of you restrain his fury

TWO SECURITY MEN restrain HIERONIMO The Royal Party return
to their carts

HIERONIMO
Nay soft and fair You shall not need to strive
(as the Golf Carts take off)
Needs must he go that the devils drive

ABOARD THE KING’S CART - LORENZO is driving it

KING
What accident hath happened to Hieronimo
I have not seen him to demean him so

LORENZO
My gracious Lord he’s full of extreme pride
And covetous of having to himself
The ransom of the young Prince Balthazar

ANGLE ON BALTHAZAR
Running after them jumping aboard the AMBASSADOR’s cart

LORENZO
Distract and in a manner lunatic

KING
Believe me nephew we are sorry for it

They stop at the green pull out their putters

KING
This is the love that fathers bear their sons
(to CASTILE)
But gentle brother go give him this gold
The Prince’s ransom let him have his due

CASTILE takes the money looks back towards HIERONIMO raving
at the GUARDS He shakes his head uneasily

LORENZO
But since he is thus haplessly distract
‘Tis requisite his office be resigned
And given to one of more discretion

KING
We should increase his melancholy so
‘Tis best that we think further on it first
(he claps the AMBASSADOR on the shoulder)
And now let us prefix a certain time
Wherein the marriage may be solemnised
Twixt Balthazar and Bel-Imperia

AMBASSADOR
Therein your Highness highly shall content
His Majesty the King of Portugal

ANGLE ON CASTILE

Watching concerned as HIERONIMO breaks free of the GUARDS and
runs off across the Golf Course

ANGLE ON LORENZO

Eyeing his dad nervously

45 ANOTHER PART OF THE GOLF COURSE EXT DAY
A wind is blowing up

TWO PAPARAZZI cross the links following the tracks of the golf
carts and the royal litter They are laden down with cameras
and camera bags They hail HIERONIMO

PAPARAZZO
By your leave sir

HIERONIMO
Good leave have you

PAPARAZZA
Pray you which way went my Lord the Duke

HIERONIMO
The next way from me

PAPARAZZA
You could not tell us if his son were with him

HIERONIMO
Who my Lord Lorenzo

PAPARAZZO
Ay sir

HIERONIMO
O forbear
If you desire to know the way to him
Then list to me and I’11 resolve your doubt
There is a path upon your left-hand side
That leadeth from a guilty conscience (CONT )
HIERONIMO (CONT )
Unto a forest of distrust and fear
A darksome place and dangerous to pass
There shall you meet with melancholy thoughts
Which will conduct you to Despair and Death

PAPARAZZA takes HIERONIMO’s picture
PAPARAZZO warns his colleague not to waste her film

HIERONIMO
Not far from thence where murderers have built
A habitation for their curséd souls
There in a brazen cauldron on a sulphur flame
Yourselves shall find Lorenzo bathing him
In boiling lead and blood of innocents

PAPARAZZO
Ha ha ha

HIERONIMO
Ha ha ha
Why ha ha ha Farewell good ha ha ha

PAPARAZZA
Doubtless this man is passing lunatic

They shiver nervously An ICY WIND blows over them
They walk on shaking surrounded by GHOSTS they do not see

46 HIERONIMO’ S HOUSE EXT NIGHT

By the light of the moon the house the gardens and
HIERONIMO’s bower Lights glow on the upper floors of the
modest building

HIERIONIMO enters the garden

HIERONIMO
I pry through every crevice of each wall
Look on each tree and search through every brake
Beat at the bushes stamp our mother earth
Yet cannot I behold my son Horatio

As he speaks HORATIO’S GHOST appears and tries to speak to
him It fails It disappears

HIERONIMO falls down weeping The garden gate creaks

HIERONIMO

How now who’s there Spirits Spirits

ANGLE ON HIS SERVANTS JACQUES AND PEDRO
Running up with torches

PEDRO

We are your servants that attend you sir

ANGLE ON ISABELLA

Hurrying to HIERONIMO’s side He tries to wipe his eyes

to hide from her that he has been crying

ISABELLA
Dear Hieronimo come indoors

O seek not means so to increase thy sorrow

HIERONIMO
Indeed Isabella We do nothing here

I do not cry ask Pedro and ask Jacques
Not I indeed We are very merry very merry

He hurries into the house

ISABELLA indicates the SERVANTS should go after him

She remains in the bower
HORATIO’S GHOST appears

ISABELLA
How be merry here Be merry here

Is not this the place and this the very tree
Where my Horatio hied where he was murdered

Again HORATIO’S GHOST tries to attract the attention of the

living And fails ISABELLA goes to the trellis

ISABELLA

This was the tree I set it of a kernel
And when our hot Spain could not let it grow

But that the infant and humane sap
Began to wither duly twice a morning

Would I be sprinkling it with fountain water
At last it grew and grew and bore and bore

She studies the tree which overgrows the trellis
HORATIO was hanged

from which

ISABELLA
Till at length it grew a gallows
and did bear our son
It bore thy fruit and mine
O wicked wicked plant

She breaks down

47 HIERONIMO’S STUDY INT NIGHT

A loud pounding at the door HIERONIMO is seated at his desk
looking at his accounting books

The books cover many years spent in the KING’s service - every
entry attentively filled out by HIERIONIMO’s scrupulous hand

HIERONIMO
See who knocked there

No answer from PEDRO or JACQUES HIERONIMO gets up and goes
into the big --

48 MAIN ROOM INT NIGHT

-- and opens the front door

REVENGE looms in the doorway

HIERONIMO squints

REVENGE disappears
Puzzled HIERONIMO closes the door He turns and sees --

-- the PAINTER played by the actor who plays REVENGE seated
at his easel and canvas on a stool in the middle of the room

The subject of his painting is not yet seen

HIERONIMO
A painter sir Cans’t paint some comfort

PAINTER
God bless you sir

HIERONIMO goes to his sideboard and gets a bottle of port and
some glasses

HIERONIMO
What woulds’t thou have good fellow

HIERONIMO

PAINTER
Justice sir

stops in mid-pour

HIERONIMO
O ambitious beggar woulds’t thou have that
That lives not in the world
Why all the undelved minds cannot buy
An ounce of justice ‘tis a jewel so inestimable
I tell thee God hath engrossed all justice
in his hands
And there is none but what comes from him

PAINTER
Oh then I see that God must right me for
my murdered son

HIERONIMO
(goes to him)
How Was thy son murdered

PAINTER
Ay sir No man did hold a son so dear

HIERONIMO
What not as thine That’s a lie
As massie as the earth I had a son
Whose least unvalued hair did weigh
A thousand of thy sons And he was murdered

PAINTER
Alas sir I had no more but he

HIERONIMO
Nor I nor I But this same one of mine
Was worth a legion but all is one

He pulls up a bench sits down as the PAINTER paints
For all he knows he’s sitting for his portrait

HIERONIMO
Come let’s talk wisely now
Was thy son murdered

PAINTER
Ay sir

He points
trellis

HIERONIMO
So was mine
How do’st take it Art thou not sometimes mad
Are there no tricks that come before thine eyes

PAINTER
O Lord yes sir

HIERONIMO
Art a painter Can’st paint me a tear or a wound
A groan or a sigh

through the window to bower with the TREE above the

HIERONIMO
Cans’t paint me such a tree as this

PAINTER
Very well sir

HIERONIMO
Nay I pray mark me sir Then sir would I
have you paint me this tree this very tree
Cans’t paint a doleful cry

PAINTER
Seemingly sir

HIERONIMO
Nay it should cry but all is one
Well sir paint me a youth run through and
through with villains’ swords hanging upon
this tree
Cans’t thou draw a murderer

PAINTER
I’1l warrant you sir I have the pattern of
the most notorious villains that ever lived
in all Spain

HEIRONIMO
O let them be worse Worse Stretch thine art
Bring me forth in my shirt with a torch in my
hand and with these words “What noise is this
Who calls Hieronimo” May it be done

PAINTER
Yes sir
HIERONIMO
Let the clouds scowl make the moon dark
the stars extinct the winds blowing the bells
tolling the owl shrieking the toads croaking
the minutes jeering and the clock striking twelve
And then at last sir starting behold a man
hanging
And tottering and tottering as you know the
wind will weave a man and I with a pair of shears
to cut him down

CLOSE UP ON HIERONIMO
HIERONIMO
and looking upon him by the advantage of
my torch find to be my son Horatio
ANGLE ON THE PAINTING

As the PAINTER turns the easel to show HIERONIMO his work

It is a portrait of LORENZO BALTHAZAR and their dead
ACCOMPLICES murdering HORATIO

PAINTER
And is this the end

HIERONIMO
Ono there is no end The end is death

and madness

HIERONIMO reaches for his sword which hangs beside the door
He turns back sword drawn to slash the painting --

-- but there is no painting and no PAINTER

He slashes at the air

49 MAGISTRATES’ COURT INT DAY

HIERONIMO heavy-eyed from lack of sleep doggedly pursues his
official duties as chief magistrate He surveys the courtroom

and a massive amount of official documents which he must read
and sign

Stretching away from him is a long line of PETITIONERS

HIERONIMO
Come near you men that thus importune me
HIERONIMO (CONT )
Now must I bear a face of gravity
Come on sirs what’s the matter

CITIZEN 2
Sir an action

CITIZEN 1
Mine of debt

HIERONIMO
Give place

CITIZEN 2
No sir Mine is an action of the case

CITIZEN 3
Mine an Ejection Firma by a Lease

They thrust their papers at HIERONIMO for signature
He notices an OLD MAN with mournful eyes and hands raised
heavenward This OLD MAN too is played by REVENGE

HIERONIMO
Say father tell me what’s thy suit

The OLD MAN hands him a paper HIERONIMO reads it

HIERONIMO
What’s here The humble supplication
Of Don Bazulto for his murdered son

The OLD MAN nods

HIERONIMO
No sir It was my murdered son My son
O my son o my son Horatio
But mine or thine Bazulto be content
Here take my handkerchief and wipe your eyes

He pulls loose the BLOOD-SOAKED SCARF of HORATIO and ANDREA

HIERONIMO
O no Not this Horatio this was thine
And when I dyed it in thy dearest blood
This was a token twixt thy soul and me
That of thy death revengéd I should be
Revenge on them that murderéd my son
Then will I rent and tear them Thus and thus
Shivering their limbs in pieces with my teeth

HIERONIMO tears the papers apart with his teeth
CONSTERNATION in the court room

CITIZEN 1
O sir my declaration

CITIZEN 2
Save my bond

HIERONIMO flees into the cloakroom Behind him --

CITIZEN 3
Alas my lease It cost me ten pound
And you my lord have torn the same

50 MAGISTRATES’ CLOAKROOM INT DAY
HIERONIMO pulls off his cloak

The occupants of the court flee as HIERONIMO overturns the
statue of JUSTICE and the plinths of great JURISTS

He turns and the silent OLD MAN is there

HIERONIMO

Now I know thee
Thou art the lively image of my grief
Within thy face my sorrows I may see
Thy eyes are gummed with tears thy cheeks are wan
Thy forehead troubled and thy muttering lips
Murmur sad words abruptly broken off
By force of windy sighs thy spirit breathes
And all this sorrow riseth for thy son

(pause heavily)
And self same sorrow feel I for my son

HIERONIMO yanks off his CHAIN OF OFFICE He turns to exit
throwing it aside as he goes

51 GUEST ROOM CASTILE’S PALACE INT DAY

BEL-IMPERIA’S MAID is draping a necklace around BEL-IMPERIA’s
neck BEL-IMPERIA standsa determined expression on her face

She wears full finery as if about to attend a lavish function

The DOOR opens to reveal LORENZO dressed in military regalia

He hesitates uncertain of his sister’s mood

She gives him an ironic smile as if to say she’1ll go along
with his game Relieved he enters kisses her cheek

The PAGE peers around the door holding a GUN - clearly put
there by his master in case things had gone the other way

LORENZO motions to him to put the GUN away and unctuously
ushers BEL-IMPERIA out the door

52 COURTYARD CASTILE’S PALACE EXT DAY

She waves to the applauding crowd as BALTHAZAR joins her --
the Golden Couple

VICEROY

With thee my son - since whom I live to see
Take this my crown I give it her and thee

Even more applause BALTHAZAR drags BEL-IMPERIA over
The VICEROY embraces them both

VICEROY
Now let me live a solitary life
In ceaseless prayers

KING
Come worthy Viceroy and accompany thy friend
A place more private fits this princely mood

VICEROY
Or here or where your Highness thinks is good

They all sit down to watch the FASHION SHOW

LORENZO tries to join them but is intercepted by his father
CASTILE

CASTILE
Nay stay Lorenzo Let me talk with you
See’st thou the entertainment of these Kings

LORENZO
I do my lord And joy to see the same

CASTILE
And knowest thou why this meeting is

LORENZO
For her my lord whom Balthazar doth love
And to confirm their promised marriage

CASTILE
She is thy sister

LORENZO
Who Bel-Imperia
(with forced casualness)
Ay my gracious lord
And this is the day that I have longed so
happily to see

CASTILE
(meaningfully)
Thou wouldst be loathe that any fault of thine
Should intercept her in her happiness

ANGLE ON BEL-IMPERIA

Gritting her teeth watching the fashion show

LORENZO
(sanctimoniously)
Heavens will not let Lorenzo err so much

CASTILE
Why then Lorenzo listen to my words
It is suspected and reported too
That thou Lorenzo wrong’st Hieronimo
And in his suits towards his Majesty
Still keep him back and seek to cross his suit

LORENZO
That I my lord

CASTILE
I tell thee son myself have heard it said
When to my sorrow I have been ashamed
To answer for thee though thou art my son
Lorenzo know’st thou not the common love
And kindness that Hieronimo hath won
By his deserts within the Court of Spain

LORENZO
Ay

CASTILE
Seest thou not the King my brother’s care
On his behalf and to procure his health
Lorenzo should thou thwart his passions
And he exclaim against thee to the King
Oh what a scandal were’t among these Kings
To hear Hieronimo exclaim on thee

LORENZO
Father it lies not in Lorenzo’s power
To stop the vulgar liberal of their tongues -

CASTILE
Tell me And look you tell me truly too
Whence grows the ground of this report in Court

LORENZO
Dad no man lives that long contenteth all

CASTILE
My self have seen thee busily keep back
Him and his supplications from the King

LORENZO
Because I pitied him in his distress
I held him thence with kind and courteous words
As free from malice to Hieronimo
As to my soul my lord

CASTILE drums his fingers nervously Loud music pounds

CASTILE
Hieronimo my son mistakes thee then

LORENZO
My gracious father believe me so He doth
But what’s a silly man distract in mind
Thinking upon the murder of his son
Alas how easy is it for him to err
But for his satisfaction and the world’s
‘Twere good my lord that Hieronimo and I
Were reconciled if he misconstrued me

CASTILE beckons to SERVANTS

CASTILE
Lorenzo thou hast said it It shall be so
Go one of you and call Hieronimo

ANGLE ON BEL-IMPERIA AND BALTHAZAR
He paws her as they watch the fashion show

BALTHAZAR
Come Bel-Imperia Balthazar’s content
My sorrow’s ease and sovereign of my bliss
Since heaven has ordained thee to be mine
Disperse those clouds and melancholy looks
BEL-IMPERIA
My looks my lord are fitting for my love
Which new-begun can show no brighter yet
(rises)
I see my lord and father

She hurries to CASTILE BALTHAZAR stumbles after her

CASTILE
Welcome Balthazar Welcome brave Prince
And welcome Bel-Imperia How now girl
Why comes’t thou sadly to salute us thus

BEL-IMPERIA does not answer glares at LORENZO
CASTILE
Content thyself for I am satisfied
It is not now as when Andrea lived
We have forgotten and forgiven that
Now thou art gracéd with a happier love

ANGLE ON HIERONIMO

HIERONIMO
Where’s the Duke

SERVANT

encouraged

CASTILE
Welcome Hieronimo

He looks at LORENZO and the Prince

LORENZO
Welcome Hieronimo

BALTHAZAR
Welcome

BEL-IMPERIA
WELCOME

HIERONIMO
My lords I thank you for Horatio

BEL-IMPERIA nods furiously

CASTILE
Hieronimo the reason that I sent
To speak with you is this --

Uncomfortable CASTILE doesn’t know what to say
A BLAST OF MUSIC from the sound system distracts him

HIERONIMO
What so short
Then I’1l be gone I thank you for it

CASTILE
No stay Hieronimo Go call him son

LORENZO hurries after the departing HIERONIMO

LORENZO
(shouting above the music)
Hieronimo my father craves a word with you

HIERONIMO
(shouting back)
With me sir Why my lord I thought you
had done

LORENZO
(to himself)
No would he had

CASTILE tries to take HIERONIMO aside

CASTILE
I hear you find yourself aggrieved saying
My son denies you access to the King

HIERONIMO
Why is this not a miserable thing my lord

CASTILE
(nervously)
Hieronimo I hope you have no cause (CONT )
CASTILE (CONT )
And would be loathe that one of your deserts
Should once have reason to suspect my son
Considering how I think of you myself

HIERONIMO doesn’t know what to say He looks at BEL-IMPERIA
She looks pointedly at the SECURITY GUARDS shakes her head

HIERONIMO
These be the scandalous reports of those
That love not me and hate my lord too much
Should I suspect Lorenzo would prevent
Or cross my suit that loved my son so well
My lord I am ashamed it should be said

LORENZO
(relieved eagerly)
Hieronimo I never gave you cause

HIERONIMO
(through gritted teeth)
My good lord I know you did not

CASTILE
There then Pause

He beckons the PAPARAZZI over Arranges the GROUP around his
daughter and BALTHAZAR All smile Pictures are taken

CASTILE
And for the satisfaction of the world
Here before Prince Balthazar and me
Embrace each other and be perfect friends

CASTILE grabs HIERONIMO and LORENZO drags them to the front
Makes them shake hands More photos

HIERONIMO
I’1l be friends with you all --
(to CASTILE)
-- specially with you my lovely lord

BALTHAZAR
Why this is friendly done Hieronimo

LORENZO
And that I hope old grudges are forgot

HIERONIMO
What else It were a shame it should not be so

SERVANTS pass champagne around Toasts Photos Amid the
general relief no one notices HIERONIMO and BEL-IMPERIA
exchange a significant look

53 ABANDONED BUILDING INT DAY

REVENGE lies sleeping in a hammock a smug expression on his
face

Faintly-visible GHOSTS stand around him moaning
ANDREA more visible moans loudest of all

ANDREA
Awake Revenge Cerberus awake
(shakes him)
Revenge awake

REVENGE
Awake for why

ANDREA
Awake Revenge for thou art ill-advised
To sleep away what thou art warned to watch

REVENGE
Content thyself and do not trouble me

ANDREA
Hieronimo with Lorenzo’s joined in league
And intercepts our passage to revenge

REVENGE
Content thyself Andrea Though I sleep
Yet is my mood soliciting their souls
Sufficeth thee that poor Hieronimo
Cannot forget his son Horatio
Nor dies Revenge although he sleeps awhile

REVENGE bounds up goes to the PUPPET TABLE where the PUPPET
BATTLEFIELD was laid He sweeps dead PUPPETS carts and trees
and tanks aside and sets out the images of HIERONIMO LORENZO
ISABELLA BALTHAZAR BEL-IMPERIA CASTILE the AMBASSADOR the
KING

REVENGE
(imitating ANDREA)

“Awake Revenge Reveal this mystery”

He turns a single light on --

CLOSE ON THE PUPPETS

We see that they are all standing next to tiny boxes of
DYNAMITE sticking out of the mud - they are in a MINEFIELD
ANGLE ON REVENGE

Backing away from the table laying out a long FUSE

ANDREA
Sufficeth me thy meaning’s understood
And thanks to thee and those infernal powers
That will not tolerate a lover’s woe
Rest thee for I will sit to see the rest

REVENGE
Then argue not for thou hast thy request

REVENGE returns to the hammock lights the FUSE

54 COURTYARD EXT DAY
The Party and the Fashion Show and the toasting continue

LORENZO and BALTHAZAR are having their pictures taken with the
VICEROY and the KING CASTILE is giving an interview

HIERONIMO and BEL-IMPERIA are momentarily left alone in an
arched open corridor She grabs his arm -

BEL-IMPERIA
Is this the love thou bearest Horatio
Whom both my letters and thine own belief
Assures they to be causeless slaughtered

HIERONIMO looks around to make sure they are alone
BEL-IMPERIA rails at him

BEL-IMPERIA

(indicating the party)
Are these the fruits of thine incessant tears
Hieronimo for shame Hieronimo
For such ingratitude unto thy son
Myself a stranger in respect of thee
So loved his life as still I wish their deaths
And though I bear it out for fashion’s sake
Nor shall his death be unrevenged by me --
HIERONIMO
Madam ‘tis true
I found a letter written in your name
And in that letter how Horatio died
Pardon O Pardon Bel-Imperia
My fear and care in not believing it
And here I vow if you but give consent
I will ere long determine of their deaths
Swear vengeance on those cursed murderers

CAMERAS FLASH
LORENZO BALTHAZAR and a crowd of PAPARAZZI surround them
HIERONIMO and BEL-IMPERIA smile and wave for the cameras

LORENZO
Where is old Hieronimo our Marshall

BEL-IMPERIA
(under her breath to HIERONIMO)
I’1l join thee to revenge Horatio’s death

HIERONIMO
(same to BEL-IMPERIA waving)
Lady the plot’s already in my head
(greets BALTHAZAR and LORENZO)
Here they are

BALTHAZAR
How now Hieronimo What courting Bel-Imperia

HIERONIMO
Ay my lord
She hath my heart but you my lord hath hers

LORENZO
Hieronimo now or never we are to entreat
thy help

HIERONIMO
My help Why my good lords assure yourselves
of me

LORENZO

(to PAPARAZZI)
He promised us in honour of our guest
To grace our banquet with some pompous jest

BALTHAZAR
(to HIERONIMO)
To entertain my father with the like
Or any suchlike pleasing motion
Assure yourself it will content them well

HIERONIMO
(with a glance at BEL-IMPERIA)
Is this all

BALTHAZAR
Ay this is all

He beckons to them LORENZO and BALTHAZAR arm around BEL-
IMPERIA follow him through the door into his --

55 STEWARD’S OFFICE INT DAY
-- where many more accounting books and stores are housed
HIERONIMO leads them to his little desk where a PAPER KNIFE
lies He eyes it
Outside through the window the party continues
HIERONIMO
When I was young I gave my mind
And plied myself to fruitless poetry -
He glances at the knife Is it sharp enough
HIERONIMO
- which though it profit the Professor naught
Yet is it passing pleasing to the world

He rummages through his books

HIERONIMO
When in Toledo where I studied
It was my chance to write a Tragedy
So here my Lords -
He hands LORENZO a book
ANGLE ON BEL-IMPERIA
Also eyeing the paper knife BALTHAZAR clings to her

HIERONIMO
- Which long forgot I found the other day

LORENZO studies the book over-interestedly
BALTHAZAR goes to join him

BEL-IMPERIA grabs the paper knife Touches the blade
It is completely blunt And BALTHAZAR is in his armour
HIERONIMO shakes his head

HIERONIMO
Now would your lordships favour me so much
As but to grace me with your acting in it
I mean each one of you to play a part
Assure you it will prove most passing strange
And wondrous plausible to this assembly

He points out the window at the frolicking crowd

BALTHAZAR
What Would you have us play a TRAGEDY

HIERONIMO
Why Nero thought it no disparagement
And kings and emperors have tane delight
To make experience of their wits in plays

LORENZO
Nay be not angry good Hieronimo
The Prince but asked a question

BEL-IMPERIA looks around for another weapon Picks up a PAPER-
WEIGHT

BALTHAZAR
Hieronimo if you be in earnest
I’1l be in it

LORENZO
And I too

HIERONIMO
Now my good Lord could you entreat
Your sister Bel-Imperia to appear
For what’s a play without a woman in it

They turn toward her BEL-IMPERIA pretends to admire the
Ppaper-weight She puts it down again

BEL-IMPERIA
Little entreaty shall serve me Hieronimo
For I must needs be employed in your play
You will but let us know the argument

HIERONIMO
That shall I roundly The Chronicles of Spain
Record this written of a Knight of Rhodes --

56 REHEARSAL ROOM INT DAY
HIERONIMO directs the rehearsals of his PLAY
ANGLE ON LORENZO
Who is playing the KNIGHT OF RHODES
His BODYGUARDS ever present in the background
HIERONIMO vO
He was betrothed and wedded at the length
To one Perseda an Italian dame --
ANGLE ON BEL-IMPERIA
Who plays PERSEDA
HIERONIMO vO
-- Whose beauty ravished all that her beheld
Especially the soul of Soliman --

ANGLE ON BALTHAZAR

Slack-jawed fish-faced attended by his BODYGUARDS
HIERONIMO the director attempts to make him more animated

HIERONIMO vO
-- Who at the marriage was the chiefest guest
By sundry means sought Soliman to win
Perseda’s love - and could not gain the same

BEL-IMPERIA and BALTHAZAR attempt to act this out under
HIERONIMO’s direction and the gazes of their ENTOURAGES

HIERONIMO vO
He saw she was not otherwise to be won
Save by her husband’s death this Knight of Rhodes --
LORENZO strikes an attitude on stage

HIERONIMO vO
Whom presently by treachery he slew
BALTHAZAR pretends to slay LORENZO

HIERONIMO vO
She stirred with an exceeding hate therefore
As cause of this slew Soliman --

BEL-IMPERIA pretends to get it wrong Doesn’t look at
BALTHAZAR at all

HIERONIMO vO
Did stab herself This is the Tragedy

Into the REHEARSAL - LORENZO claps his hands

LORENZO
O excellent

HIERONIMO
And here my lords are several abstracts drawn
For each of you to note your parts
And act it as occasions offered you

HIERONIMO goes to BALTHAZAR hands him a new script

BEL-IMPERIA
(to BALTHAZAR)
You must provide a Turkish cape a black
moustachio and a falcon

LORENZO
(to BEL-IMPERIA)
And madam you must attire yourself

BALTHAZAR
Hieronimo methinks a comedy were better

HIERONIMO
A comedy
Fie Comedies are fit for common wits
But to present a Kingly troupe withall
Give me a stately written tragedy
Containing matter and not common things

LORENZO
And well it may For I have seen the like
In Paris ‘mongst the French tragedians

HIERONIMO
In Paris Very well remembered
There’s one thing more that rests for us to do

BALTHAZAR
What’s that Hieronimo Forget not anything

HIERONIMO
Each one of us must act his part
In unknown languages
That it may breed the more variety

BEL-IMPERIA smothers her laughter

HIERONIMO
As you my lord in Latin I in Greek
(to LORENZO)
You in Italian and for because I know
That Bel-Imperia hath practised the French
In courtly French shall all her phrases be

BEL-IMPERIA
You mean to try my cunning then Hieronimo

BALTHAZAR
But this will be a mere confusion
And hardly shall we all be understood

BEL-IMPERIA
It must be so for the conclusion
Shall prove the invention and all good

HIERONIMO the director claps his hands

They go back to declaiming their parts in different languages

57 HIERONIMO’S GARDEN EXT DUSK

ISABELLA pushes a wheelbarrow towards the bower
She wears her gardening gear and rubber wellies

ISABELLA
Tell me no more - O monstrous homicides
Since neither piety nor pity moves
The King to justice or compassion
I will revenge myself upon this place
Where thus they murdered my beloved son

She parks the wheelbarrow beside the trellis
Removes a hacksaw an axe various tools

She pulls down the trellis covered in roses
ISABELLA
Down with these branches and these loathsome
boughs
Down with them Isabella rent them up

And burn the roots from whence the rest is sprung

She grabs her axe and starts to hack at the base of the tree

ISABELLA
I will not leave a root a stalk a tree
a bough a branch a blossom nor a leaf
No not a herb within this garden plot
Accursed complot of my misery
Fruitless forever may this garden be
Barren the earth and blissless whosoever
Imagines not to keep it unmanured

With the hacksaw she saws at the tree

ISABELLA
An eastern wind commix’d with noisome airs

Shall blast the plants and the young saplings

The earth with serpents shall be pestered
And passers-by for fear to be infect

Shall stand aloof and looking at it tell
“There murdered died the son of Isabel”

The tree falls
ISABELLA feels no better
ISABELLA

Make haste Hieronimo to hold excused
Thy negligence in pursuit of their deaths

Whose hateful wrath bereaved him of his breath

Ah ha thou doest delay their deaths
Forgives the murderers of thy noble son
And none but I bestir me - to no end

She cuts down some smaller plants with the GARDENING SHEARS

Stares intently at the SHEARS

ISABELLA
And as I curse this tree from further fruit
So shall my womb be curséd for his sake
And with this weapon will I wound the breast
The hapless breast that gave Horatio suck --

She stabs herself

58 GARDEN PATH EXT DUSK

HIERONIMO comes walking up the path beside the canal
He’s laughing to himself

HIERONIMO
“As you my lord in Latin I in Greek
You in Italian” Isabella

Calling to his wife to share the joke he pushes open the gate

59 HIERONIMO’S GARDEN EXT DUSK

60 STAGE DOOR EXT DAY

A TAXI pulls up outside the stage door of the Playhouse

The ACTORS are all making up as HIERONIMO and the PAGE carry
the bag through

HIERONIMO
Are you ready Balthazar
Where’s your beard

BALTHAZAR shows his beard is half-on half off

HIERONIMO
Dispatch for shame Are you so long

He pauses beside BEL-IMPERIA who studies TWO KNIVES
She taps them against the table It’s clear that they are

NOT prop knives HIERONIMO takes another knife from his
pocket shows her that it retracts

He takes one of the real knives and puts it in a drawer
Replaces it with the stage knife

He exits carrying the bag

BEL-IMPERIA immediately opens the drawer and switches the
knives again She will only use the REAL

LORENZO
Break a leg

“NO SMOKING” sign

CASTILE
How now Hieronimo Where’s your fellows
That you take all this pain

HIERONIMO
O sir it is for the author’s credit
To look that all things may go well
But good my Lord --

He climbs down the ladder gets a script from the prompt
corner

HIERONIMO
-- Let me entreat your Grace
To give the King this copy of the play
This is the argument of what we show

CASTILE
And are you in the play Hieronimo

64 PLAYHOUSE INT NIGHT

The ROYALS and DIGNITARIES assemble in the upper circle
Due to BALTHAZAR’s having moved the furniture there is much
discussion as to protocol No one can sit down

Before the ROYAL PARTY are seated the lights go down
ANGLE ON THE STAGE

The curtains open Enter the PLAYERS They start declaiming
in their various languages First BALTHAZAR reciting his
lines in Latin

ANGLE ON THE KING

Sitting down in the first available seat The VICEROY sits
next to him trying to read the script

KING
See Viceroy that is Balthazar your son
That represents the emperor Soliman
How well he acts his amorous passion

VICEROY
Ay Bel-Imperia hath taught him that

CASTILE
That’s because his mind runs all on Bel-Imperia

A PAGE whispers in their ears The KING is in the wrong seat -
not the Throne that was prepared for him They all get up
again

ON STAGE LORENZO enters declaims in Italian
KING
Here comes Lorenzo Look upon the plot

And tell me brother what part plays he

ON THE BALCONY CASTILE studying the text trips in the
darkness as they change seats

ON STAGE BEL-IMPERIA welcomes BALTHAZAR’s character in
French HIERONIMO plots with BALTHAZAR in Greek

HIERONIMO approaches LORENZO makes great obeisance to him
then STABS HIM

UP CLOSE we see the stabbing is real as RED BLOOD flows
LORENZO struggles and tries to escape HIERONIMO embraces him
pushes the knife further in

ANGLE ON THE BALCONY

Where the ROYAL GUESTS sitting down again have missed the
murder They are drawn back to the action by BEL-IMPERIA’s
shrieks

64G ANGLE ON THE GHOST AUDIENCE BELOW

Watching silently

ANGLE ON BALTHAZAR

On stage thinking that the play’s going pretty well striding
up to BEL-IMPERIA to embrace her

ANGLE ON BEL-IMPERIA

Beckoning to him speaking in French

ANGLE ON BALTHAZAR

Flattering her in Latin

She stabs him in the throat above his breastplate

He gives a satisfying scream and death rattle careens about
the stage falls over with a crash

ANGLE ON THE ROYAL GALLERY

Much applause from the gallery at BALTHAZAR’s performance
ANGLE ON HIERONIMO

Dropping LORENZO’s corpse looking over to BEL-IMPERIA

HIERONIMO
No

But too late BEL-IMPERIA stabs herself with the other knife

She falls The curtain falls
ANGLE ON THE GALLERY
Much applause

The CURTAIN opens again HIERONIMO stands among the corpses
cunningly arranged before the black crepe curtain

KING
Well said Old Marshall this was bravely done

HIERONIMO
(looking sadly at BEL-IMPERIA’s corpse)
But Bel-Imperia played Perseda well

The KING rises everyone else does the same keen to get down
to the bar

VICEROY
(looking around for his coat)
Were this in earnest Bel-Imperia
You would be better to my son than so

KING
But now what follows for Hieronimo

HIERONIMO
Marry this follows
Here break we off our sundry languages
And thus conclude I in our vulgar tongue
Haply you think - but bootless are your thoughts -
That this is fabulously counterfeit
He indicates the BODIES at his feet
Excited laughter from above as the GUESTS head for the exits

HIERONIMO
No princes know that I am Hieronimo
The hopeless father of a hapless son

HIERONIMO pulls the black crepe screen down --

-- revealing HORATIO’s decaying CORPSE arranged as a pieta
Behind it a high SCAFFOLD and dangling NOOSE

ANGLE ON THE KING AND THE VICEROY

Talking about something else

ANGLE ON CASTILE
Lighting their cigars

HIERONIMO
See here my show Look on this spectacle
Here lay my hope and here my hope hath end
Here lay my heart and here my heart was slain
Here lay my treasure here my treasure lost
Here lay my bliss and here my bliss bereft
But hope heart treasure joy and bliss
All fled failed died yes all decayed with this

The GUESTS all leave the balcony No one listens to him

The GHOST of HORATIO appears on the stage and attempts to
comfort HIERONIMO But staring at the body HIERONIMO is
unaware

ISABELLA’S GHOST appears there too but cannot speak to him

HIERONIMO
They murdered me that made these fatal marks
The cause was love whence grew this mortal hate
The hate Lorenzo and young Balthazar
The love my son to Bel-Imperia

The KING and the VICEROY and CASTILE with glasses of champagne
to toast the ACTORS enter the lower hall They approach the
stage

HIERONIMO
Speak Portuguese whose loss resembles mine
If thou cans’t weep upon thy Balthazar
‘Tis like I wailed for my Horatio
When merciless they butchered up my boy
In black dark night to pale dim cruel death

ANGLE ON THE VICEROY
Stepping up to see his son is really dead

HIERONIMO
(to CASTILE)
And you my Lord whose reconciléd son
Marched in a net and thought himself unseen
And rated me for brainsick lunacy
How can you brook our play’s catastrophe

ANGLE ON CASTILE

Discovering his son and daughter are both dead

Behind him HIERONIMO mounts the scaffolding that is the only
feature of the stage Above the scaffold platform a NOOSE
hangs

HIERONIMO
Poor Bel-Imperia missed her part in this
For though the story says she should have died
Yet I of kindness and of care for her
Did otherwise determine of her end
But love of him whom they did hate too much
Did urge her resolution to be such

ANGLE ON HIERONIMO
Standing atop his platform
HIERONIMO
And Princes now behold Hieronimo
Author and actor in this tragedy
And gentles thus I end my play
Urge no more words I have no more to say

He adjusts the NOOSE around his neck

The KING VICEROY and GUARDS storm up the scaffolding to get
him down

64G ANGLE ON THE GHOST AUDIENCE
Applauding
ANGLE ON THE VICEROY
Struggling with HIERONIMO pulling the rope from his neck
KING
O harken Viceroy Hold Hieronimo

Brother my nephew and thy son are slain

The GUARDS and GUESTS and AUDIENCE come pouring in aroused by
the commotion The VICEROY calls to them

VICEROY
We are betrayed My Balthazar is slain

The VICEROY and GUARDS bring HIERONIMO down the stairs to the
main stage
HIERONIMO

KING
Speak traitor damned bloody murderer speak
For now I have thee I will make thee speak
Why hast thou done this undeserving deed

VICEROY
Why hast thou murdered my Balthazar

CASTILE
Why hast thou butchered both my children thus

says nothing

KING
Why doest thou mock us slave Bring tortures
forth

HIERONIMO
Do do do and meantime I’11 torture you
You had a son as I take it and your son
Should ha’ been married to your daughter
was’t not so
You had a son too - he was my Liege’s nephew
He was proud and politic and had he lived
He might have come to wear the Crown of Spain
I think ‘twas so ‘Twas I that killed him
Look you this same hand ‘twas it that stabbed
His heart D’you see this hand
For one Horatio - if you ever knew him -
My guiltless son - was by Lorenzo slain
and by Lorenzo and that Balthazar
Am I at last revengéd thoroughly
Upon whose souls may heaven yet be revenged

GUARDS arrive with torture instruments

VICEROY
Be deaf my senses I can hear no more

KING
Fall heaven and cover us with thy sad ruins

CASTILE
Speak Who were thy confederates in this

For HIERONIMO this is the last straw

They have

heard nothing he has said

HIERONIMO

Now to express the rupture of my part
First take my tongue and afterwards my heart

He bites out his tongue spits RED BLOOD everywhere

All are aghast at the horrible sight
Belated TWO GUARDS grab him

KING

See Viceroy he hath bitten forth his tongue

Rather than to reveal what we

CASTILE
Yet can he write

KING

required

And if in this he satisfy us not
We will devise the extremest kind of death
That ever was invented for a wretch

They give him a pencil

AMUBLANCE CREWS and PARAMEDICS arrive

EMERGENCY VEHICLE

lights shine through the exits Screams

HIERONIMO breaks the tip off his pencil
knife to sharpen it

PAGE

He makes signs for a

O he would have a knife to mend his pen

The PAGE rushes beneath the legs of the

GUARDS and hands

HIERONIMO a PENKNIFE The PAGE holds his hand out for a tip

but is ignored

VICEROY

Advise him that he write the truth --

HIERONIMO stabs CASTILE with the penknife then himself

KING
Look to my brother

CASTILE
Stop Hieronimo

CASTILE falls dead HIERONIMO collapses atop his body

He dies

KING
What age hath ever heard such monstrous deeds

64G ANGLE ON THE GHOSTS

Mingling with the horrified LIVING staring at the DEAD

65 TOWER EXT DAY

ANDREA and REVENGE sits at a chess board in a glassed-in tower
Outside below them and on the patio around them are MANY
GHOSTS

ANDREA
Ay now my hopes have end in their effects
When blood and sorrow finish my desires
(as ANDREA recounts the murders
REVENGE mops up ANDREA’s chess pieces)
Horatio murdered in his father’s bower
Vile Serberine by Pedringano slain
False Pedringano hanged by quaint device
Fair Isabella by herself misdone
Prince Balthazar by Bel-Imperia stabbed
The Duke of Castile and his wicked son
Both done to death by old Hieronimo
Ay These were spectacles to please my soul

ANDREA’S GHOST is delighted even though he has lost the game
Outside the glass we see the GHOSTS of some of the above

REVENGE
This hand shall hail them down to deepest hell
Where none but furies bugs and tortures dwell

ANDREA is aghast This is more than he bargained for
ANDREA
(protesting)
But sweet Revenge do this at my request
Let me be judge --
REVENGE triumphant shakes his head

He stands up drags ANDREA outside to watch as the GHOSTS move
silently down the stairs

REVENGE
So haste we down to meet thy friends and foes

ANGLE ON THE LOWER LEVEL

A GIANT MAW OF HELL has opened and all the GHOSTS march
inexorably inside

ANDREA would change the chain of events he put in motion
But now it is TOO LATE

And HUNDREDS OF GHOSTS stream past him down into the OPEN
MOUTH OF HELL

REVENGE
For here though death hath end their misery
I’1l there begin their endless tragedy
CRANE UP ABOVE THE CITY

To see THOUSANDS OF TRANSPARENT GHOSTS as they move stately
in their DESCENT TO HELL

THE END
