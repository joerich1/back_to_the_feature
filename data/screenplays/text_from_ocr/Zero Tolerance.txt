Que descansada vida

La que huye del mundanal ruido

Y sigue la escondida senda

Por donde los grandes sabios hanido

What follows are media reports and a deposition relating to John Hull and
other figures in the Contra support network in Costa Rica

Sam Gundy was a fictional character but Rudy and I based him on what we
read about Hull and other American expatriates (such as the mysterious
Michaels) whose amateur enthusiasm for the CIA prolonged a terrorist
war and aided and abetted the drug trade

ai JOHN HULL ONCE OLIVER NORTH’S
MANIN COSTA RICA IS NOW ACCUSED

OF RUNNING GUNS AND DRUGS

By Ron Arias

F ust before dawn breaks over his Costa Rican
ranch 30 miles south of Nicaragua John Hull
loads the back of his pickup truck with workers
then drives past an armed sentry and an unleashed
attack dog “You don’t want to be out here at
night not when that dog’s patrolling” says the 68-
year-old American “He’s already bit me bit my
wife even bit my son” As the pickup rumbles out
of the ranch’s main compound toward the fields
beyond a woman and
child appear and Hull
stops briefly to talk “Her
husbands sick and she’s
come to get help” he says
later “I just told her to
hang tight Id be right
back—and to watch out
for that damn dog Believe
me I wish I didn’t need
him but I do”
These are perilous
times for Hull a diehard
foe of Nicaragua’s Sandi-
nista regime His enemies
in Managua have plotted
to kill him he claims and
he fears they may try
again Also with the fail-
ure of the contra cause he
faces serious legal trou-
bles in his adopted home-
land Prompted by accusa-
tions that his private
airstrips were used to car-
ry weapons to the contras
and cocaine to the US
Hull was arrested by Costa Rican authorities in
January and charged with drug trafficking and vi-
olating that country’s security laws He spent
two months in jail—part of it in a hospital ward
because of heart problems—before friends
and neighbors raised 37500 for his
bail Under Costa Rican law his case
is now undergoing further investiga-
tion before a final decision is made
whether to try him
Hull’s chief American ally former
National Security Council staff member Oli-
ver North has been of little help to the belea-
guered rancher The onetime White House

“As a patriotic American it’s to inform

champion of aid to the contras has spent the past
three months in a US court battling a 12-count in-
dictment of his own Earlier this month while Hull
awaited the outcome of North’s trial US Sen
John Kerry dealt the crusty Evanston Ill native
another blow The Massachusetts Democrat who
chairs a subcommittee on narcotics terrorism and
international operations released a report calling
Hull “a central figure in contra operations” and

Saircshars Joba Kacy Brtick Acielias cand Dicintel PAACR on-
nounce a subcommittee report implicating Hull in an

trade

citing a convicted drug smuggler who claimed
Hull had been present when cocaine was loaded
aboard a plane returning to the US

“The newspapers have already hung me just by
quoting some dope dealer in a Florida prison”
says Hull angrily “Bull Ive never seen cocaine in
my life”

A veteran pilot who maintains six airstrips scat-
tered over the 10 Costa Rican ranches he owns or
manages Hull admits aiding the contras but says
he used his airstrips solely to retrieve injured reb-
els from battle zones in Nicaragua “Everyone
knew I was helping the contras” he says “I took
out their wounded held bleeding children in my
arms fed the fighters and gave them shelter I also
briefed the CIA on everything I knew that was go-
ing on in the war zone but that’s all I did I wasn’t

dont care wh they cc hin af
heniies Care right oredr 4 tirel

running drugs If were Id have bought
myself a few new tractors instead of go-
ing on with some old wrecks that belong
in a museum”

After dropping his workers at various
spots around his 1640-acre cattle and cit-
rus ranch Hull drives his pickup back
along the gravel road waving to the sen-
try “The Communists have been out to
get me for years” says the tanned
balding patriarch “Three times people
were sent to kill me Once we chased
them away with gunfire and two other
times got tips about plots to do me in I
was lucky” While in jail last January
Hull decided to send his son Johnny 17
into hiding in the US “I couldn’t take a

“For a few years ® woshalliryingto

Hull next to his grounded Cessna 180

chance with my son” he says “They
might have gone after him the next time”

The threats didn’t cause Hull any re-
grets for his pro-contra efforts and “Id
do it again if had to” he says adamantly
“Only this time—speaking as an armchair
general—Id like to have some offshore
naval guns break the Sandinistas’ back by
taking out all their refineries bridges and
ammo dumps first Take about 30 min-
utes and save us a lot of lives It’s what we
should have done a long time ago”

Hull is equally firm in his views about
Oliver North calling his trial a disgrace to
the nation Hull first met the former Ma-
rine lieutenant colonel in 1983 while in
Washington visiting then Sen Dan

Quayle another vocal contra supporter
Quayle helped arrange an introduction at
the White House Hull says and North
was pleased to meet such an avid fellow
anti-Communist Charges that North mis-
handled contra funds or acted unpatrioti-
cally cause Hull to bristle “There’s no
way youd get me to believe he took a
penny for personal use” he says in
North’s defense “Now this deal about his
trying to get security for his house well
who wouldn’t try to protect himself
Hell the CIA once paid for five of my
bodyguards And Im certainly not in the
same league as Ollie North”

Those bodyguards were armed sentries
posted at Hull’s main ranch near Muelle
de San Carlos says Hull and he insists
that their salaries were all the money he
received from the CIA The Kerry report
offers a different account stating that for
two years Hull received 10000 a month
from contra leader Adolfo Calero all at
North’s direction

Heart troubles or not by late morning
Hull is on horseback riding among a herd
of cattle Although down on his luck he is
still clearly the patrén of his domain and
proud of his image as last of a breed—the
rugged frontier landowner He often calls
his ranch hands peons but over the years
he has saved lives and relieved suffering
he says by flying many sick or pregnant
villagers for medical treatment to the
nearby city of Quesada or to the coun-
try’s capital San José

Hull first arrived here 20 years ago af-
ter several failed attempts to start enter-
prises in other Latin American countries
“It was raw paradise—miles of trees no
roads and a lot of rivers to ford first
came with my father who was an agro-
nomist and what we found was some of
the richest volcanic soil in the world So I
decided to stay In 15 years we were
turning virgin forest into the country’s
breadbasket”

Hulls enterprises eventually did well
enough for him to buy and develop more
property He later attracted other US in-
vestors who also bought land and al-
lowed Hull to manage their interests
“Then the Sandinistas took over next
door and the devil slipped into paradise”
he says “All I was doing in helping the
contras was just protecting my land and
my investments”

Hull still owns a 700-acre grain farm
outside Patoka Ind and he’s still legally
married to Mariella 70 now a retired
schoolteacher who manages the spread
“What can I say—he’s the Great White
Hunter” says Mariella without bitter-
ness adding that she had to remain in In-
diana to raise their daughter Mary Ana
now in her 40s and care for Hulls and
her own aging parents “The marriage
just didn’t work out with so many separa-
tions Now it looks like John’s world is
coming toa screeching halt But he’s still
the father of my daughter He knows he’s
always got a home here”

For the time being though Hull’s
home remains the spacious airy house
overlooking his main ranch It is there
that he lives with Margarita Acosta 36
a former servant who has been his live-
in companion for the past 19 years and
who is the mother of their absent son
Johnny Hull’s troubles have not only
cost him his son’s company but have
drained him of cash as well He says his
business is suffering because of his two-
month absence in jail and he has laid
off half of his 100 or so workers Local
banks have closed off credit to him (“for
obvious political reasons” he says) and
the government has forbidden him to
use his single-engine Cessna or any of
his airstrips “I feel trapped and perse-
cuted but at least lots of folks still come
by You see at heart I’m just an old
country boy just wanting to live my
simple life”

Not that Hull’s life is simple these days
Though his trial is still an uncertainty if
convicted he will face an eight- to 20-year
prison sentence “Id dearly like to go to
the US” he says “If they let me leave
my doctor wants me to check into a clinic
in North Carolina to have my heart
looked after” Hull in fact does have
friends abroad Democratic Congress-

Hull hands the man an
envelope for Rob Owen a
former Dan Quayle aide who
had served Oliver North
as a courier delivering money
and messages to the contras

man Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Re-
publican Congressman David Dreier of
California recently led a bipartisan effort
of 19 US Congressmen urging President
Oscar Arias to free him

By late afternoon the house is quiet
and the distant shrieking of wild mon-
keys carries clearly through the shuttered
windows Servants have finished cleaning
up after a weekend fiesta and the wed-

I”Whern first met John was only 17 and a servant” says Hull’s companion Margarita “But right away he won my heart”

ding of Hulls stepdaughter Sandra 19
Of the 200 visitors who came the few still
left on the veranda include several for-
eign reporters some neighbors and a
taciturn graying emissary from retired
US Army Maj Gen John K Singlaub
a longtime pro-contra fund-raiser The
emissary and Hull confer in hushed
voices out of hearing of the other guests
Later as they part Hull hands the man
an envelope with the name ROB OWEN
written on it Owen a former aide to
Senator Quayle had later served Oliver
North as a courier delivering money and
messages to the contras

A short while later an unabashed Hull
admirer arrives from Florida for a visit
He approaches his hero with a smart
salute and announces “Commander
Hull Joe Cortina Special Forces demo-
litions—reporting for duty” Hull smiles
at the bluster of the former Vietnam
Green Beret who has come armed this
day with only a video camera and a gift
bottle of champagne Although Hull nev-
er served in the US military he joined
Britain’s Royal Air Force before the US
entered World War II and rose to a cap-
tain’s rank “At ease” says Hull in a
tired voice “Welcome to the fight I
need all the help I can get” ©

trafficking “You can’t beat Ron when it
comes to parachuting into a situation
and coming back with a story” says
James Kunen the editor who first sug-
gested that Arias profile Hull “He can
talk to anybody—left right or center
—because he knows how to listen”
That talent proved indispensable dur-
ing the week Arias spent at Hull’s ranch
near the Costa Rica-Nicaragua bor-

has worked asa Peace Corps volunteer in

AFFIDAVIT OF
Robert M Hayes

Although I will reveal the full details of my intelligence
background and activities only before a grand jury trial jury or
congressional committee I will say that during and after my
military service in the United States Army (RA11312792) I worked
for or with the Army Security Service the National Security
Agency the Central Intelligence Agency and the Armys Criminal
Investigative Division

This affidavit is limited to my activities from approximately
1971 through 1977 in Lakeland Florida Sao Paulo Brazil and
Albuquerque New Mexico

I moved to Lakeland in 1971 to accept a position as chief
engineer of Davy Powergas now known AD Davy McKee Subsequent

to my arrival in Lakeland I was approached in Lakeland bya man

who identified himself only as Erickson of Army CID in
Pensacola He asked me to assist in an investigation of an
alleged conspiracy to steal a military payroll from Fort Stewart
Ga The investigation was halted after the chief suspect
Military Police Sgt Robert Farl Ward was severely wounded Nov
23 1971 in a gun battle with Punta Gorda Florida police
officers Ward was charged witi two counts of attempted murder
for wounding two policemen

Early in 1972 I learned that all civil and military charges
against Ward had been mysteriously dropped The suspicious
circumstances surrounding the lack of prosecution prompted me to
telephone the Lakeland Police Department on March 5 1972 and
arrange to surrender two Browning 38 automatic pistols and a
modified 30 military carbine that Ward had stored at my
apartment I subsequently learned from a source in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation that ballistics test of the two pistols
confirmed the weapons had been used in at least one murder in
Long Island New York

On March’ 6 1972 I received a call from Erickson asking me
to meet him the following day at Roberts Flying Service at
Lakeland Municipal Airport On the morning of the 7th I met in
Lakeland with Richard Barest Wards Lakeland attorney who
suggested I leave Lakeland

Following the meeting with Barest I met Erickon who arrived
at Lakeland’airport in a US Air Force plane He informed me
that my participation in the investigation could not be-—)
acknowledged nor my safety guaranteed He also reconimended that I
leave Lakeland PA

Acting on that advice I traveled to Sao PB 4lo Brazil
arriving on July 12 1972 I lived at first with a Lebanese
family Through the family I was introduced dn uly 25 to Ferris
Dubakues an agent of Al Fatah a radical Palestinian terrorist
organization affiliated with the Palestinian Libe ation
Organization Dubakues attempted to recruit me aSand AlFatah
terrorist but I refused to participate in any way i e

teffrorist
activities

I subsequently was contacted by Max Schoener an Israeli
intelligence agent or and Seymour Malkin who frequently worked
for Schoener At their request I agreed to work for Mossad

I later met and worked for Frederick Mayer and Franz Jank
agents for West German intelligence I continued accepting
assignments from Mossad and sometimes sold information developed
for one intelligence agency to the other agency

During this and subsequent periods I used the aliases of
Roberto Reis in Brazil and Roberto Reyes in Argentina My
passports and other credentials in those names and that of Al
Assal have since been destroyed

On Jan 9 1973 I was granted resident alien status in
Brazil I subsequently applied for and was granted Brazilian gun
permit 745123 for a 22 Astra automatic and permit 741426 for a
-38 Taurus revolver”

After working for a Brazilian engineering company I
eventually formed Hayes-Bosworth a Brazilian company engaged in
heavy engineering and construction projects for Brazilian and
foreign clients Between 1972 and 1976 the companys success
provided me with the funds contacts and time to indulge my
lifelong interest in Latin American politics

While building HayesBosworth I continued my affiliation
with Israeli and West German intelligence and eventually was
recruited by the United States Central Intelligence Agency

My first contact with the CIA came on June 19 1973 when I
was introduced to Joe Sibley Our initial meeting occurred at the
Sao Paulo apartment of a mutual friend who introduced Sibley as
an engineer engaged in consulting work for Anaconda Copper Co in
Chile

This and subsequent conversations with Sibley established him
as an American expatriate extremely knowledgable in Chilean
politics and reasonably familiar with Latin America in general
These conversations also established Sibleys strong anti-
communist attitude an attitude I shared both then and now

I next met Silbey on Feb 14 1974 at my office at
HayesBosworth We met again on Feb 22

In March or April of that year I received a call from Frank
Ryan an official at the US consulate in Sao Paulo He asked me
to come to the consulate to update some paperwork When I arrived
at the consulate Ryanescorted me to an office within the
consulate where Sibley was seated at a desk

After Ryan left the room Sibley informed me that his
‘treal name was John Joseph Michaels and produced corroborating
identification that I recognized from previous experience as
genuine CIA credentials He then recited in great detail and
accuracy my previous connections with and setvicefor various
US intelligence organizations including theagehcy Hé also
recited details of my work for Israeli and West Germ
intelligence ™

Michaels then requested my assistance in illegal c ande® ine
operations that he referred to as projects He said he
operations were targeted against communist agents in Latin
America primarily those working for or under the control o
Cuban intelligence operatives

I agreed to work for Michaels and subsequently accepted
several operations in which the identity and loyalty of the
targets was established to my satisfaction These operations
occurred between 1974 and 1976 and ranged from routine
intelligence gathering to kidnapping interrogation and
assassination

I accepted these operations in the belief that I was serving
the best interests of the American government and was operating
with the sanction of that government I received no payment for
conducting these operations and frequently spent large sums of my
personal funds to accomplish them

My relationship with Michaels ended abruptly 1976 after
Michaels proposed an operation that I considered not only absurd
but also contrary to the best interest of the US government

In the spring of 1976 Michaels proposed that I arrange to
‘simulate terrorism I responded that there is no way to
simulate terrorism I insisted that an act is either
terrorist or not and anyone knowingly engaging in a violent act
against civilians is in fact a terrorist and beyond sanction

Despite my objection Michaels continued to endorse the
concept explaining that evidence would be planted in such a
manner to ensure that the operation would be blamed on Cuban
agents

When I asked what the target of this simulated act was to
be he proposed three A large Catholic cathedral in Sao Paulo a
twin theatre complex near the US consulate in Sao Paulo and the
US consulate itself

Although I refused the operation in unmistakable terms
Michaels insisted that I reconsider and said two of his agents
would contact me for further discussions

In late June or early July of 1976 I was approached at my
office by two Americans I knew to be subordinates of Michaels
They once again proposed a bombing attack of one of three targets
originally proposed by Michaels

The meeting resulted in two other meetings The third and
final meeting ended in an angry exchanges in which I rejected
both the operation and the concept and told Michaels
subordinates I never wanted to see him or them again

The following week the two Americans were found dead in a
downtown Sao Paulo park with their hands and feet bound by wire
Each had been shot in the back of the head No a wére made
in connection with the death

The deaths of the two Americans were followé
deaths on the same day of four of my associates
made in connection with their deaths

Reliable contacts in the Brazilian government “and miitary
and contacts in other circles warned me that that my ow eath
was imminent if I did not flee Brazil

Before I could arrange a departure I was visited atmy
office by heavily-armed members of the Brazilian Air Force
security branch The officer in charge of the detatchment had
orders to transport me to Cumbica a facility widely known in
Brazil as a military concentration camp Through threats of

by the-violent
o arrests were -

violence and the timely intervention of Brazilian friends I
postponed my arrest

Although I remain unaware of the precise connection between
Michaels and the Brazilian Air Force I am convinced this visit
and a subsequent incident with the security force were ordered
and orchestrated by Michaels

After the incident at my office and warnings from friends I
prepared to flee Brazil with my pregnant American wife
Accompanied by several heavilyarmed employees my wife and I
arrived at the airport to return to the US We were met by the
same Brazilian officer who had attempted to arrest me at my
office

The officer said that both I and my wife were wanted for
questioning at Cumbica I informed the officer that I would
accompany him if my wife were allowed to continue to the US I
also informed him that should he refuse my men would engage his
in a gun battle in the airport lobby Under those conditions he
permitted my wife to depart and delayed my arrest until her plane
had sufficient time to clear Brazilian air space

Once I was convinced my wife was safely out of the country I
accompanied the officer to the airport parking lot where there
was an explosive diversion that permitted me to escape under
cover of gunfire

After hiding with friends for a day I drove across Brazil
with a friend crossed the border into Paraguay and made my way
to Asuncion The following day after an attempt on my life that
left me wounded I flew from there via Braniff Airlines to Miami
I traveled under my own passport

I was met at the Miami airport by agents from the local CIA
office Although they denied any specific knowledge of me or my
activities they asked what my plans were Upon telling them that
I planned to fly to Albuquerque New Mexico to join my wife who
was staying there with her parents they asked me to call the-
‘Denver CIA office after my arrival

I contacted the Denver office and later was contacted by the

‘CIA office in Santa Fe New Mexico which dispatched an agent
known to me as Carl Tollonin to debrief me Charen Tater Was
joined by a second agent known to me as Roy Cla on Over
period of several months first Tollonon and £hen Clarkson
attempted to convince me that I had been dupéd by Michels and
had never in fact worked for US intelligente7T y also
convinced me that Michaels had been killed smugglil weapons in
the Middle East L

Throughout this debriefing I considered Michaels ource
of my problems — which included the premature birth of wy first
daughter a birth that I believe was accelerated by the strains
the situation in Brazilhad placed on my wife And I blamed
Michaels wrath on my refusal to simulate terrorism

Once Clarkson persuaded me that Michaels was dead I was
prepared to forget the incident and rebuild my life I remained
in Alburquerque for several years During that period I was asked
by contacts I knew to be CIA agents to assist in an effort to
compromise certain Arabic students attending universities in the
Southwest Once compromised the students were to be manipulated

by the CIA after they returned home and rose to prominence within
their countries I refused to participate

While still in New Mexico I was recruited by a statewide
task force to become an undercover informant in an investigation
of organized crime The task force was created by then New Mexico
Attorney General Jeff Bingamen who now is a US Sentaor from
New Mexico and his assistant Roy Anescowioz The task forces
chief investigator was former CIA agent Sam Papich My primary
contact with the task force was an investigator named Pete
Donahue

My value as an informant arose from my social contacts with
alleged organized crime figures George Demuksian Gerry Tevisanno
and Billy Marchiando I agreed to provide the task force with
information on their activities and ultimately testified before
a statewide grand jury in 1978 Despite the evidence presented by
the task force no indictment was returned a fact I attribute to
deliberate prosecutorial mismanagement by Bingamen

I eventually returned to Lakeland in 1981 and buried the
Brazilian incident and my other intelligence activities in my
past But Michaels returned to haunt me late last year when I
read a November 16 1987 Time magazine article titled The
Misadventures of el Patron The article detailed the activities
of John Hull an American expatriate operating a farm on Costa
Ricas northern border with Nicaragua Hull was identified in the
article and in previous testimony by himself and others as a CIA
agent whose farm was used to transship weapons and other supplies
to the Contra rebels opposing the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua

Although he has consistently denied it Hull also has been
accused in court testimony and published accounts of
participation with others in an aborted plot to bomb the US
embassy in San Jua Costa Rica and to blame the bombing on
agents of the Sandinista government

The article was accompanied by a color photograph of Hull
which I immediately identified as John Joseph Michaels After
subsequent research and further examination of the photograph I
remain convinced that John Joseph Michaels and John Hull are the
same individual and that Michaels activities in Brazil are part
of a continuing pattern of operations that led to the plot to
bomb the US embassy in Costa Rica as he had asked me to bomb
the US consulate in Sao Paulo -

PM-COSTARICA-DRUGS
COSTA RICA PANEL URGES BAN ON NORTH POINDEXTER

SAN JOSE Costa Rica Reuter - A parliamentary committee
has recommended an immigration ban on former US ambassador
Lewis A Tambs and several Iran-Contra arms scandal figures
including former White House aide Oliver North and ex-National
Security Council chief John Poindexter

The proposal made public Thursday was issued by a lower
house committee set up a year ago to investigate drug smuggling
in Costa Rica

Under the proposal which is not binding and has yet to be
approved by the full legislature North Poindexter Tambs and
arms dealer Richard Secord would be forbidden entry to Costa
Rica

The committee said its proposal was based on the belief
that they were in some way involved in arms and drug smuggling
in Costa Rican territory

The Iranarms-Contra affair which rocked the presidency of
Ronald Reagan involved a scheme to divert millions of dollars
in profits from US arms sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels at a time when Congress had banned official US
aid

North who was fired by Reagan for his role in the affair
was convicted on three felony charges and was sentenced July 5
to perform 1200 hours of community service and fined 150000
He was acquitted of nine other charges

Poindexter a retired admiral who resigned as national
security adviser when the scandal was disclosed on Nov 25
1986 faces charges of conspiracy to divert funds theft of
government property fraud lying to Congress and obstruction
of a congressional investigation

The panel also recommended cancelation of the Costa Rican
citizenship of US-born farmer John Hull who has been indicted
by a local court for arms and drug trafficking

Five representatives made up the commission chaired by
deputy Alberto Fait of the government National Liberation
Party

The panel also recommended removal of bank secrecy
provisions on deposits larger than 5000 to avoid money
laundering of drug profits
