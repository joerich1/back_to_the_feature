INT BEDROOM A RUSTIC CABIN - NIGHT 1

A pair of hands rifles through the pages of a book Discards
it and grabs another The process repeats until a folded up
ARTICLE is revealed nestled within a hardback

A slender yet handsome figure -- we don’t get a good look at
his face but we’ll learn this is ALEX LINDEN -- unfolds
and scans the pages He stuffs them in his suit jacket grabs
his cell phone and walks downstairs towards

INT DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS 2

Alex gets in the tub raising the steaming water to the brim
Grabs his phone and scans Twitter (AlexLinden) New messages

joins a rushing tide and tumbles down the page out of sight
He drops his phone in the bath revealing his stricken face

INT A BUSTLING NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS 4

Phones ring Shouts reverberate across the open room Middle-
aged men with stained shirts and considerable guts bluster
down aisles of desks holding mock-ups of tomorrow’s paper

BEN KAPLAN -- tall and reedy and more contemplative
than most -- takes a big gulp of coffee and hunches over his
computer We GLIMPSE what looks like a fledgeling novel The
words “Chapter Two” and a whole lot of white space

NIGHT EDITOR (0OC)
Ben Your pages set

Ben CLICKS AWAY quickly to a newspaper layout The NIGHT
EDITOR slows as he nears but doesn’t stop

BEN
Yeah yeah Almost
Ben turns to his computer SCROLLS to reveal A PHOTO of a man
in a penis costume getting arrested An empty headline field
waiting to be filled

Ben’s cell phone RINGS breaking his concentration

BEN (CONT’D)
Goddammit Alex

But Ben doesn’t recognize the number Decides to answer it
BEN (CONT’D)

HIS MISSED CALLS It’s “Alex Linden” all the way down

INT A BROOKLYN LOFT - A LITTLE LATER 5

SIRI HOPKINS -- beautiful arty ethereal -- turns an
opened envelope over and over in her hands Reopens it

“Dear Ms Siri Hopkins Congratulations You have been named
a J Liddle Urban Architectural Fellow for 2013”

Siri refolds the letter Feels a heady mix of elation and
dread She hears KEYS JANGLING IN THE HALLWAY and loses her
nerve Flicks off the bedside light and lies back in bed
The DOOR OPENS and Ben appears silhouetted by the hallway
fluorescents He sheds his clothes while Siri feigns sleep
Slips into bed and holds her from behind Siri stirs

SIRI
Good day

Ben buries his face in the nape of Siri’s neck

cell phone The firm buzzes with activity around her

SARAH
Oh my God Are you serious Of
course you are What a stupid
question I’1ll train up as soon
as I can okay

Sarah struggles to keep her emotions in check

picks up the office phone and dials

Isaac processes this information They wait together ina
moment of awkward silence

19 INT THE DINING ROOM THE CABIN - AFTERNOON 19

Ben approaches the bathroom door He’s armed with a sponge
and bleach and dreading what kind of scene Alex may have left
behind He steels himself Opens the door to reveal

A QUICK YET DISTURBING GLIMPSE of dried blood in the bathtub
clinging to the grout between the tiles A bloody handprint

Ben SLAMS the door shut Before he can decide what to do he
hears Siri’s car PULL UP outside Car doors OPEN AND SLAM

truth The Japanese are the most
whacked-out people on earth

racist

throbbing inbred hothouse of
cultural miasma Frankly I’m
surprised they don’t have more

What are you supposed to say “Hey
Alex Interesting choice to commit
suicide”

SARAH
Thank you Ben Hi by the way

Sarah and Ben hug

JOSH
I can’t believe you’re on her side

SIRI

start going at it again

SARAH
I think we should watch him

JOSH
What Like set up a monitoring
system

SARAH

It’d be casual But yeah tag in

Josh

JOSH
I’m just saying we graduated at
the onset of the worst recession in
eighty years History says most of
us will never regain the income
levels we might have otherwise
enjoyed Isaac here is a beautiful
anomaly and for that we salute him

ISAAC
Thanks Josh How’s the PhD

JOSH
What’s that supposed to mean

ISAAC
It’s a simple question

JOSH
But it had subtext

ISAAC
You want the subtext

JOSH
Of course I want the subtext

ISAAC
How’s life on your academic
pedestal reading books and
despairing about the decline of our
culture

JOSH
It’s comments like those that make
me despair

There’s a charged moment that could go either way Isaac
laughs it off

ISAAC
Seriously What do you do all day

JOSH
I’m writing about the future of
biography How our ever-expanding
digital footprint -- emails texts
tweets what have you -- will
inform our “understanding of
history and ourselves”

BEN
Which is ironic

KATE
Why

JOSH
Because I hate the modern world

KATE
What era would you rather have
lived in

JOSH
Honey The only thing I hate more

than the present is nostalgia for
the past

The former roommates trade uncomfortable looks

old man

You’re an ass

SIRI
Come on Both you guys--

JOSH
What are you gonna do Put ‘em on
facebook

SARAH

I don’t know Maybe

JOSH
You’re clinically obsessed

SARAH
I like seeing what my friends are
up to So what

JOSH
So your News Feed tells you Isaac
is enjoying a Merlot in Napa or
Ben wrote a funny headline for the
Post and you think that means you
still know someone

ISAAC
Josh Sarah--

SARAH
Yeah I do Because that’s what
people do Josh People who care
at least

JOSH
Sorry but I’d rather be in the
fucking dark about what people are
up to than mistake some false level
of intimacy for friendship
Josh’s words hang uncomfortably in the air

SARAH
We’re still friends

JOSH
Isaac’s on his Blackberry sending
work emails to San Francisco

ISAAC
(stashing his phone)
Fuck you
SARAH

Remember that time freshman year
when we all got high and went to
check out the glass flowers at the
Natural History Museum

ISAAC
You got so paranoid

SARAH
You had to talk me down

Kate notes their intimacy Places her arm around

KATE
What was Isaac like in college

BEN
Dorky

JOSH
Uncultured

BEN

Pretty much exactly as he is now
Kate kisses Isaac

KATE
Then he must have been adorable

BEN
What do you do Kate

KATE
I work at a suicide and crisis
hotline for teens in the Bay Area
(a beat)
Sorry I didn’t realize how strange
that would sound until it came out

Isaac

ALEX

(sarcastic)
Shame I didn’t have your number
Could’ve solved all my problems

Kate looks at the ground and blushes No one knows whether to
rebuke Alex for his meanness Siri stands up

SIRI

She gives Ben a look that means he’s meant to follow her

BEN
Me too I guess
JOSH
Already Hey it is just like

college
Ben begs him “not now” with his eyes before leaving

ALEX
Think they’1ll get married

SARAH
Hopefully

JOSH
Why

SARAH
I want to go to a wedding

JOSH
Youd wish them eternal unhappiness
in exchange for a cover band

SARAH
Who says they’d be unhappy

JOSH
The institution of marriage is
inherently unhappy

ALEX
If anyone can do it they can

ALEX

Of you all Of the possibility that

SARAH
That’s ridiculous

ALEX
It’s the truth I remember that
feeling it didn’t go away until
junior year Ben had me at his
parents’ place in New York for
Easter I don’t know what it was
It just felt like I’d entered this
warm space you know We took the
train there and back Barely
talked It was better than talking

Sarah’s emotions swell She sits up to look at him

SARAH
Alex I don’t know how to say this
but have you thought about therapy
‘Cause I’ve done it a lot and--

constantly anxious but can never
pinpoint why

wonders for the anxiety My
therapist says the other stuff is

SARAH
It’s just you

JOSH
Do you think they heard us

SARAH
How would I know

JOSH
She always was a light sleeper

SARAH
What is that supposed to mean

JOSH

dorky orange ear plugs and still
complain about the church bells
waking her up every morning and--

SARAH
(getting it appalled)
Youre still in love with her
aren’t you

Josh looks away

JOSH
Why just because she’s gorgeous and
smart and has the most symmetrical
face known to man And Ben gets
everything he’s ever wanted in life
and I get--

SARAH
Where do you get off thinking the
whole universe is conspiring
against you

JOSH
Wanna go again

SARAH
You’re a dick

JOSH
All guys are dicks We’re hard-
wired that way It’s a simple
matter of natural selection

SARAH
You’re a dick who imagines he’s
better than one because he can back
up his dickish behavior with psycho-
babble and pseudo-science

Yeah yeah you’re right So you want
to go again

Sarah shakes her head at his temerity They go at it again

insecure and--

SIRI
It’s complicated He was your
first

SARAH

No it’s simple He’s using me

SIRI
Who’s to say you aren’t using him

SARAH
Because he’s a man-child who uses
sex as a means of processing
serious emotional issues

And you’re an overworked tax
attorney who could stand to get
laid

SARAH

Sarah shoots Siri a look of disbelief

Alex halts in his tracks

point
ALEX
What do you mean
SIRI

ALEX

ALEX (CONTD)
Hey I’m sorry about what I said
last night

KATE
It’s okay You’re not even 48 hours
removed from a traumatic event
You’re suddenly the subject of a
lot of love and attention and it’s
making you feel a bit manic but
also oddly angry I imagine you
experience rapid mood cycling and
you’re scared as hell about the
next time you’1ll crash So no I’m
not taking it personally

Alex is surprised by her insight and candor

ALEX
Good

KATE
And don’t worry You’1l level off

basins too

JOSH
And then you’d have everything you
need to start your own cult
Wouldn’t that be something

BEN

Josh wields a fishing rod Casts a line He’s an inept
fisherman

His yells are met by silence The dog looks up expectantly

BEN
He looks hungry

Ben takes out a granola bar Isaac stops him

ISAAC

Whoa You don’t feed a strange dog
BEN

Why not
ISAAC

Because you’1l just confuse it and
make everything worse

BEN
That’s bullshit

Ben bends down and feeds the dog Storm clouds gather
JOSH

I just felt a drop It’s gonna
start pouring

BEN
Well we can’t just leave him here

ISAAC
Owner should have thought of that
and put a tag on him

JOSH
Yeah and that poor person should
have made more money if he was
planning on getting sick Don’t

SARAH
Oh would you

CUT TO

EXT THE MEADOW BEHIND THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS 56

The guys plus dog walk getting drenched by the rain They
shout in order to be heard above the storm

JOSH

Is it because you grew up poor
ISAAC

What
JOSH

Is it because your family was poor

ISAAC
What are you talking about

JOSH
I don’t know Kind of like “I
worked hard to feed and clothe
myself Why can’t other people Why
can’t the dog”

ISAAC
Some people do work harder than
others

JOSH

No one is self-made

ISAAC
But there are degrees

They walk in silence for a beat

JOSH
What about your roots Wasn’t your
dad in like an auto workers’ union

ISAAC
Don’t talk to me about my roots

Sarah takes it holds it to her ear and taps on it

SARAH
Not ripe enough

Sarah selects another Repeats the process Puts it in the
cart and moves on brusquely They reach a pyramid of apples

KATE
When did you first meet Isaac
SARAH
Freshman year He lived across the
hall
KATE

God I was so nervous about going on
this trip I guess I still am

SARAH
(still uninterested)
Oh yeah
KATE

Isaac just looks up to you guys so
much It’s like meeting the
parents but worse because there
are five of you

SARAH
Be happy you’re not meeting his
parents

Sarah moves on to the onions Kate tries a different tactic

KATE
I’m so jealous of you

Kate succeeds in getting her attention with that one

SARAH
Why

KATE
You guys just have all these
experiences of him I’1l never have

SARAH
Well What do you want to know

KATE
I just want to feel like I’ve known
him for years

SARAH
Isaac was shy sweet The only
one of us from the Midwest The
least neurotic of the bunch by far

KATE
I can see it Sometimes I think he
takes me fancy places to impress
me Which is really cute but it’s
not why I like him

SARAH
Why do you

KATE
Because he’s grounded He’s kind
And he gets all worried when I’m
sad The other week we celebrated
our quarter-year anniversary Which
is ridiculous but made me so happy
And he has the right priorities
Which I think is really rare

Sarah absorbs Kate’s description Allows herself -- just for
a second -- to be overcome

Is everything okay

him What else is on our list

all you were missing was a dog And
now you’ve got your chance

Ben looks to Siri Sarah notices her becoming upset

SIRI

BEN
What

JOSH
It’s like we’re gripped by this
never-ending nostalgia for our
parents’ music It’s oppressive

BEN
Come on Who today rivals The Boss

JOSH
I’m just saying it’s unhealthy for
any generation to agree so
thoroughly with its parents that
its own music sucks

Ben digs around Holds up Arcade Fire’s Neon Bible instead

JOSH (CONTD)
Arcade Fire

BEN
What now

JOSH
Too Canadian But who knows

Josh lights his joint Inhales deeply Exhales

JOSH (CONTD)
Maybe it fits our post-modern
profile for a Canadian band to best
express American anxiety in its
gradual post-empire period of
decline

He offers the joint to Kate

KATE
I don’t normally--

JOSH
It wont bite

Kate accepts Josh’s gift Inhales Coughs Offers it to Siri
but she refuses Ben notices Odd

JOSH (CONTD)

BEN
Maybe I can just go with you I

up writing and find something that

SARAH
You guys are just saying that

minds

JOSH

We notice Kate licking the remains of her watermelon soup

JOSH (CONTD)
Okay Some of us might be

Kate looks up apologetically

KATE
I’m sorry It just feels so nice
and cool on my tongue

ISAAC
Seriously Why haven’t you opened
your own restaurant

SARAH
It’s called law school loans
JOSH
Why didn’t we do more drugs in
college
BEN

I don’t know

JOSH
I figure I’d be much less curious
now if I’d only done a better job
getting it out of my system back
then As it stands I’m stunted

BEN
We were doing well for a while
there during freshman year
Remember when Siri took her clothes
off in the Silliman quad

SIRI

embellishments

JOSH

BEN
His feet were at least

KATE
What are you guys talking about

BEN
Timmy’s favorite movie

KATE
Who’s Timmy

ISAAC
Don’t listen to him

SIRI
Why does everything in our lives
have to be like something else

ISAAC
That’s deep

SIRI
No I’m serious

JOSH
Because that’s how people relate to
each other these days We don’t
talk about things We reference
them Like “How was your weekend”
“It was good

(MORE )

JOSH (CONTD)
Kind of like Wedding Crashers meets
The Beach Or “I feel just like
Rachel when she found out Ross was
marrying that British girl”

BEN
Did you just admit to watching
Friends

JOSH

You know what That’s not the
fucking point

KATE
(touching her face)
I’ve never felt this high in my
life

Kate wipes her forehead and BEGINS UNBUTTONING HER SHIRT
KATE (CONTD)
Is anyone else like really

Isaac comes to her aid

ISAAC
Okay That’s probably enough
buttons

BEN

You mean bud

ISAAC
I mean both

A CELL PHONE RINGS Everyone looks for the source

KATE
Ooh that’s mine

Kate finds her phone and answers it at the table

KATE (CONTD)
Hello Uh huh
(a pause)
Tonight Of course I’m okay
(another one)
Okay bye

Kate hangs up the phone Clocks everyone’s expectant looks
Promptly BEGINS HYPERVENTILATING

KATE (CONTD)
Oh my God Oh my God

ISAAC
What What

JOSH
I’m on the edge of my seat

KATE
They want me to cover on the crisis
hotline Tonight I can’t breathe
I can’t breathe

ISAAC
Sure you can It’s okay

JOSH
I’m sure she’1l do great

BEN
She’1l knock ‘em dead

ISAAC
That isn’t funny

ALEX
It’s a little funny

Kate EMITS A PLAINTIVE WAIL and sinks onto the floor

KATE
I can’t do this right now

Isaac gets down on the floor Fans her while cradling her
head Sarah gets up from the table

SARAH
I’ve got some Xanax in my purse

JOSH
(reaching into his pocket)
I’ve got some Klonopin right here

SARAH
Xanax kicks in faster

Sarah leaves the room to get it Josh CALLS AFTER HER

JOSH
Well Klonopin lasts longer

BEN
Which one do you prefer Timmy

The dog looks at Ben Isaac tries to calm Kate

ISAAC
Hey Look at me We’1ll get you all
set up in a quiet room upstairs

BEN
(as the dog)
I experience less side effects with

Xanax

ISAAC
You can talk on the phone just like
you’re talking to me

KATE
Are you sure

ISAAC
Are you kidding You’1ll do fine

Sarah reenters and hands Isaac two pills

SARAH
And now you’ve got the best anti-
anxiety medicine money can buy

JOSH
Well that’s disputed

Isaac helps Kate swallow the pills

JOSH
What a nutter

SARAH
Come on Remember the first time I
got really high It happens Stop

JOSH
Since when have you become her
advocate

SARAH

Sarah swats Josh with a dish towel

CUT TO

KATE
For how I just freaked out

ISAAC
Don’t even think about it

CUT TO

INT THE LIVING ROOM THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Everyone except Kate Ben and Siri sits around drinking
more alcohol the atmosphere slightly darker and drunker

SARAH
(to Josh)
Since when did you start taking
meds

JOSH
Oh you know Now and then I score
some from friends who are really
fucked up They’re like “I’m so
fucked up I don’t know what to do
with all these meds” So I help

them out

SARAH
By purchasing their prescription
drugs

JOSH

Medication is wasted on the sick
Besides it’s only for when I’m
wondering whether I’m wasting my
life on a dissertation no one in
their right mind will ever read

Sarah digs into her purse and produces a stack of index
cards

SARAH
Let’s play a game

ISAAC
Do you keep things in your purse
just in case the conversation gets
too depressing

SARAH
(dealing the cards)
It’s just blank index cards

ALEX
Then what are the rules

SARAH
(passing out pens)
You make them up as you go
(writing something down)
Here I’ll go first

Sarah lays a card down and Isaac reads it aloud

ISAAC
Everyone must touch their head and
rub their belly before playing a
card -- or they have to drink

Ben and Siri appear Glowing a bit like we haven’t seen them

BEN
What are we doing

JOSH
Playing an imbecilic game

BEN
I’m in

Ben grabs five blank cards and sits down next to Josh Isaac
writes on an index card and plays it

SARAH
You didn’t pat your head and touch
your belly

ISAAC

Do we have to keep saying the word
“belly” It’s weirding me out

Isaac drinks Josh picks up Isaac’s card and reads aloud

JOSH
Before you speak you must turn to
the person on your left and
introduce yourself then hug
(to Isaac)
You’re fucking kidding me

SARAH
You didn’t introduce yourself
before speaking

JOSH
You didn’t either

Sarah turns to Isaac and Josh turns to Ben Awkwardness
ensues

SARAH JOSH
Hi my name is Sarah It’s Hi I’m Josh This game is
great to meet you slowly making me stupider

The two pairs hug gingerly Josh scribbles furiously pats
his head and rubs his stomach lays a card Ben picks it up
and looks to Alex

BEN
Hi I’m Ben

Ben and Alex hug Ben reads warily from the card

BEN (CONT’D)
Suicide Everyone must take turns
explaining what it means to them

Everyone’s silent Sarah shoots Josh a look Quickly writes
something on a card Pats her head rubs her stomach and
lays it down Isaac picks it up and turns to Josh

ISAAC
Hi I’m Isaac and I’m a Republican
Play this card at any time to make
all of Josh’s rules invalid

JOSH
(to Sarah)
You can’t do that You played out
of turn
SARAH
The card said it could be played at
any time
JOSH

But that’s violating the game’s
underlying architecture of taking
turns laying cards

ISAAC
Let me just add Neither of you
introduced yourselves before

speaking
SARAH JOSH
Neither did you Neither the fuck did you
ALEX
Okay Josh Let’s do it But you
start

Everyone’s startled by Alex’s comment It’s as if they’d
forgotten he was there in the room

JOSH
Okay I get sadness I get
depression I get anxiety I’m
pretty sure I’m experiencing at
least one of them at all times But
I don’t understand suicide because
I’ve never once been not absolutely
terrified of death

SARAH
I don’t want to play this game
anymore

JOSH
Why not We’ve been dancing around
the main point of this trip all
weekend I mean Christ No one
will even talk about the downstairs
bathroom and why we’re not using
it So let’s open that door
Literally metaphorically Pardon
the pun

SARAH
Josh Stop

JOSH
No Alex should give it to us
straight Tell us how good a job we
all did in bucking him up when he
was down How we noticed his
increasingly erratic Tweets and
status updates and thought enough
to do something about it How this
group meant something more than our
own entertainment back in college
How it still means something now

Sarah jumps up and leaves the room MUFFLING A SOB Alex
hesitates and Isaac looks up Ben’s become white as a sheet

JOSH (CONTD)
Let her go She’1l be okay

ISAAC
You’re an asshole

JOSH
I’m a truth teller

ISAAC
Fuck you Alex always wrote crazy
shit on Twitter How were we
supposed to know that this time--

JOSH
What was it Ask for me tomorrow
and you shall find me a grave man
Lot of ambiguity in that one

ISAAC
Well then where the hell were you

JOSH
That’s my fucking point Where the
hell were any of us

BEN
(softly)
It was my fault

Everyone looks at Ben Confused by what he’s just said

BEN (CONT’D)
Alex called me that day A few
times I didn’t pick up

(starts getting emotional)
I didn’t pick up even though I knew
he wasn’t doing well I didn’t I
was avoiding it It’s my fault
Fucking hell it’s my fault

ALEX
No it’s not I mean yeah I was
upset you weren’t answering But
I I didn’t want to die

BEN
What Then why’d you--

ALEX
I mean I thought at one point I
did But then I changed my mind I
called the hospital myself I
think I think I just really
wanted to see you

BEN
You wanted to see me

ALEX
Yeah You Everyone

All of Ben’s pent-up guilt and vulnerability starts evolving
into some serious anger

BEN
You wanted to see me and this is
what you did

ALEX
I’m not trying to say it makes
sense I just--

BEN
Do you know what I’ve been feeling
since--

ALEX

Yes I do

BEN
And now you’re saying it’s cause
you fucking wanted to see me

ALEX
Well it’s not like any of the more
conventional options were working

BEN
I had shit to do I was living my
life I was busy

ALEX
Oh yeah What was keeping you so
busy that you couldn’t find the
time Clearly not your fucking
book

Ben’s thrown by this Looks to Siri in disbelief

BEN
You told him

SIRI
Ben

BEN

to follow him No one knows what to say to each other

out of bed

SARAH (CONTD)

years ago Taken me to a movie
Bought me a fucking ice cream cone
I don’t know

JOSH
Sarah Come on

Josh sits on the edge of the bed Sarah’s fighting a losing
battle against her composure

SARAH
Instead of being the guy who
permanently fucked up my
expectations for normalcy ina
relationship The guy who made me
explain to my mom that no Josh
isn’t exactly my boyfriend He’s
more like someone who sleeps with
me when he comes home pining for my
best friend and too drunk to see
straight

Josh gets up and walks towards her as he speaks

JOSH
I was 20
SARAH
So was I
JOSH
My dad was leaving my mom
SARAH
Is that your excuse
JOSH
I was just so angry At him At

Ben At everyone

SARAH
That you didn’t even see what you
were doing to me

Josh is inches away from her at once hurt and seeking
forgiveness

BEN (CONTD)

person Like they’re so right for
you And they don’t feel the same

Alex continues to listen in At first he’s bemused But
slowly Kate’s words begin to get to him

KATE (0C) (CONT’D)
Like they’re not perfect In fact
they’re flawed And fucked up But
you even love their fuck-ups And
youre like why can’t you see what

Kate listens with her eyes closed then she opens them

KATE (CONTD)
But Amber Amber Lemme tell you
something A lot of people they’re
afraid to feel what you’re feeling
They don’t let themselves

(MORE )

KATE (CONT’D)

But you You’re willing to go
there And yeah break down a bit
when it doesn’t pan out And to me
that means you are very very
brave And to me that means you’11

Because Because it turns out I’m

alarm

the moment and you said some things
but you don’t really feel that way
And you’re going to regret it

Ben’s silent

right Maybe I don’t know

Siri feels this like a punch to the gut

SIRI
Oh my god

BEN
What

SIRI

I push you that much and you fold
Youre not even fighting me I
can’t believe you I don’t know why
I keep expecting--

BEN
That’s not fair You always pretend
to be the one who’s all in But I
don’t think you want this You just
don’t want to be the person who
admits it

Siri’s floored And frustrated

SIRI
I have tried and tried to tell you
that I don’t care what you do--

BEN
“Try” being the operative word
Siri I can feel you trying

SIRI
Goddamn I wish you could hear
yourself sometimes

BEN
Why

SIRI
Because I love you
BEN
I love you too
SIRI
But I can’t handle your self-
loathing

SARAH
Shut up

ISAAC
I’m serious You should open up
your own restaurant

SARAH
Yeah I’m sure that would fly with
my parents They work their whole
lives so I can become a doctor I
think they may have finally made
peace with my law degree

ISAAC
What’s wrong with owning a
restaurant

SARAH
Nothing It’s just It would
break their hearts

ISAAC
So you’ll just give up on what you
want

SARAH

Who says it’s what I want
Isaac looks at her

SARAH (CONTD)
Fine It’s what I want

Without warning Isaac MOVES IN TO KISS HER but she dances
out of the way

SARAH (CONTD)
Whoa

ISAAC
Fuck I’m sorry

SARAH
Don’t take it personally It’s
a new policy of mine

ISAAC
What does that mean

SARAH
I just did the same thing to Josh

ISAAC
So what you’re saying is I’m the
second reject of the evening

SARAH
Isaac Come on

ISAAC
I just I really thought this was
what you wanted

SARAH
I did I do I mean for a long
time I did

ISAAC
But

SARAH

But you don’t want this Your shy

nineteen-year-old self does You

want closure You want to express

your anxieties about how this thing

with Kate might be real Because I

think it is real and I think you

think it could be real

(a beat)

You want all those things but not

me Not really at least That’s

why
Isaac processes this As if on cue THEY HEAR FOOTSTEPS and
turn to see Kate entering from the dining room Isaac
attempts to shift gears quickly

ISAAC
Hey Is your shift over

KATE
And I don’t even think I have blood
on my hands

BEN
I can’t remember which happened
last Me writing something good Or
Siri and I having sex

JOSH
So what you’re saying is you’re
blocked in more ways than one

BEN
Sure

JOSH
Maybe it’s just a phase I hear
women go through those

BEN
Not a phase A symptom Of
something bigger

Ben motions for a cigarette Josh obliges him

BEN (CONTD)
I’m afraid to hold her too tightly
and I’m afraid to give her too much
space Fuck I don’t know

JOSH
Wow Your life sounds as fucked up
as mine

BEN

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves

Ben can’t help but smile Josh does the same They both START
CHUCKLING at the sad irony of their circumstances

Then there’s a pause as Josh summons up the will to say what
comes next

JOSH
And to think I’ve been jealous of
you for seven years

Josh’s honesty is cathartic

JOSH (CONTD)
You know as much as I’d love to
derive some perverse pleasure in
all this I can’t

BEN
Thanks

Josh puts a hand on Ben’s shoulder It’s a reconciliation of
sorts

For what

We realize that Siri’s crying

don’t know what is

Siri pauses and looks down at Alex’s bandaged wrists

SIRI
Can I see them

ALEX
Why

As Alex gets close Ben finally notices him and looks up

BEN

Alex allows himself to smile but it quickly vanishes

ALEX
Ben I’m a little fucked up

BEN

ALEX
For how long do you think

BEN
Wouldn’t push your luck

Alex starts to break down

mind

ISAAC
On the contrary I’m an
exceptionally savvy businessman

SARAH
Well I’m sorry but--

ISAAC
I’m imagining a place maybe on the
Lower East Side
Sarah pretends not to be interested
ISAAC (CONTD)
Not too big Twelve tables at
most Food from

SARAH
Upstate

ISAAC

to the area’s fading Jewish and
Chinese denizens

ISAAC
Egg Drop Matzo Ball Soup

SARAH
Szechuan Brisket

ISAAC
Stir-fried Kugel

SARAH
Gefilte Fish Dumplings

ISAAC

SIRI
Sure

Josh I really fucked up

JOSH
He’1l get past it

Siri doesn’t buy it

JOSH (CONTD)
It’s ironic though

SIRI
What

JOSH
I guess I always thought if you
were going to slip up that it’d be
with me

SIRI
Oh Josh I could never have done
that to Ben

JOSH
Sometimes your logic confuses me
SIRI
Me too
They hear A CAR APPROACHING Siri goes to the window 101

Siri watches Isaac’s rental car roll slowly up the driveway
The dog rushes out in front of the cabin barking

Siri’s suddenly flustered An emotion she almost never
displays She tries to fix her hair in the mirror

JOSH
You’ve never not looked beautiful

Siri stops fussing and looks up at Josh She’s still anxious
but she smiles thankfully

filled with writing

Gee thanks you guys Really glad I
declined the insurance

SIRI
Do you hate me

BEN
I could never do that

SIRI
Are you sure

They reach the spot at the end of the field and look back
towards the house Ben turns to face her

BEN
Wouldn’t be fair to forgive Alex
and not you

SIRI
Guys do it all the time

They look out at the Hudson Valley Ben picks up a stone and
throws it as far as he can They both watch it fall

BEN
I couldn’t believe my luck freshman
year when I found out you’d been
placed across the hall When we
actually spoke I was tempted to
throw away the idea of dumb luck
and start invoking God and Fate and
other capitalized words

SIRI
Ben Why are you talking about
this

BEN

Because if entropy is this force
that’s always conspiring to pull
people apart staying together has
its own inertia too

Ben looks at her

BEN (CONTD)
I’m really scared of what the world
will look like without you

SIRI
You can’t stay with me because
youre afraid

BEN
Youre right

Siri fixes him with her fierce gaze but it slowly softens
into sadness She rests her head on his shoulder

possibly imagined

ISAAC

left my line of sight

concession

leaf

SARAH
