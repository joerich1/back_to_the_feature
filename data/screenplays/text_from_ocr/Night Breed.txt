NIGHTBREED

Written by

Clive Barker

Fade In

Scene 1 TITLE SEQUENCE

Darkness Then a burst of sparks from a bowl held ina
scaly hand

The light shows us a mural We start to move along the wall
First we

see stars and planets painted in a primitive stylized
fashion on

bare rock A voice on the track speaks softly to us

VOICE We did not always live in hiding

We have come to the image of a huge family tree which
springs from

a single seed but divides into two separate halves On the
left

ruled by the moon the branches blossom into extraordinary
creatures

On the right by sunlight the branches end in ordinary
human beings

Upon the word Nightbreed the title comes up on the screen
against
the image of a moon painted on the wall

SCENES 2-2K Deleted

2L EXT REEDS NIGHT
Cut to a real moon Then cut wide to a moonlit landscape

through

which the camera careens madly The soundtrack which was
lush and

almost sacred in the mural chamber erupts into a tribal
rhythm We

glimpse creatures in the darkness moving through the reeds
They are

barely more than silhouettes We see teeth and gleaming
eyes

glimpses of naked patterned flesh Only glimpses

2M INT MURAL CHAMBER

Cut back to the mural chamber Now we have moved away from
the tree

to a more brutal scene A symbolic representation of a great

apocalyptic war between Naturals and Breed Terrible scenes
of

destruction

VOICE But the Naturals made war on us They feared us for
our

strength They envied our powers They called us monsters
killing us
by whatever means their malice could invent finding in each

of us

our particular vulnerability

We are scanning scenes of that war A breed being staked
like a

vampire Another being shot like a werewolf Another exposed
to

sunlight

VOICE None of us was safe The tribes of the moon dwindled
Our

gods were slaughtered our homes destroyed It was the
Apocalypse

2N EXT NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES
Cut back to the landscape The clouds roil above the heads
of the

creatures heading through the reeds We see their
destination now A

huge wall with gates

2P INT MURAL CHAMBER

And back to the mural chamber and a final scene The gates
weve

just seen are in the painting Looking over them calling
the Breed

in is a vast indistinct form that of Baphomet His eyes
burn his

arms are open in welcome

VOICE Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust
Baphomet

Wounded and near death he summoned us the last of the
last into

hiding Into Midian where we wait now The battle is over

but not

the war There will come a saviour

Now weve moved beyond the image of the gate into a new
patch of

wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches We can
interpret

some of the images nevertheless a man with a bloody hole in
the

middle of his chest A man wearing a mask like a skull We
linger on
a faceless figure

VOICE His name is Cabal He will lead and give us back the
Night
We are the tribes of the moon We are the Nightbreed

The titles end
beautiful

2Q EXT NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES

Cut back to the landscape Now we are at the gates and the
creatures slip through and away into the mist Only one a

ferocious female called Shuna Sassi remains turning to look

She beckons

SHUNA Come

The camera retreats from her

SHUNA Will you not come

Now the last of the creatures the Drummer takes her by the
snatching her away through the gates As she disappears the
follows again stopping at the gates themselves which close

unearthly din

Necropolis lying on the other side of a thick expanse of

Puzzlement overtakes despair He squints to see more

The Necropolis is vast High walls surrounded by reeds

tops of mausoleums showing above it Almost a fortressed
Boone starts towards it

66 EXT NECROPOLIS GATES DAY

The sun is low in the sky the light golden glinting off the

gates

The reeds sigh Boone pushes one of the gates open and steps
inside

His footsteps echo unnaturally loud in this city of the
dead To

either side of him elegant and elaborate mausoleums
running away

into the distance with numerous smalls tombs set around and
between

them

The sun finally sinks out of sight Its final glow dies on
the tops
of the mausoleums There are already stars overhead

Boone walks on a little way as the night sounds begin
Exhausted
he sits down on a tomb and leans back against the stone

BOONE softly - a bitter irony Dead all of the dead

He rummages for a cigarette in his jacket pocket Pulls one

out

Lights it The flame seems to excite sounds around him He
looks up

The walkways are empty in both directions

Theres a guttural sound at his back He stands drops the

cigarette backs away From the darkness behind him steps a
huge

form A knife is put to his lower belly Its wielder
Kinski isa
massive man face distorted his features grotesquely
bifurcated

KINSKI whispers Move and I gut you

Boone stays still The growling from between the tombs
becomes words

VOICE from the darkness You got him

KINSKI I got him

A reptilian hand reaches out and picks up Boones dropped

cigarette

BOONE Midian Are you from Midian

KINSKI We should take him below Peloquin

The silhouette of Peloquin a were-creature moves between
the

tombs He draws on the cigarette By its brightening point
we glimpse

an extraordinary face more animal than human but no
recognizable

species

PELOQUIN Hes not Nightbreed Hes Natural

BOONE No Ive killed people Im like you thats why Im
here

PELOQUIN Shut the fuck up Youre meat

KINSKI If we eat him we break the Law

BOONE My Godmy God its true

PELOQUIN Of course its true Everythings true he
emerge from the shadows Gods an astronaut Oz is over the

And Midians where the monsters live And you came to die

BOONE I didntdidnt come to die I came to be with you

Peloquin reaches out and touches Boones chest

PELOQUIN No Sorry I can smell innocence at fifty yards

BOONE Ive killed people Fifteen people

PELOQUIN Who told you that

BOONE What do you mean

PELOQUIN He lied asshole He lied Youre a Natural And

meansyoure meat for the Beast

Pelogquin growls throwing his head back and forth with a

grace the image flickering as he does so Boone watches

amazed In

on his

they have

T-shirt

the blur of Peloquins motion he transforms the tentacles
head lengthening and thickening thrashing around as though

a life of their own

He moves towards Boone taking hold of him and tearing his

open

KINSKI We mustnt Its the Law Theyll exile us

PELOQUIN Fuck the Law I want meat
He bites Boones neck tearing at his flesh

KINSKI Peloquin no

Kinski takes the knife from Boones belly and pushes
Peloquin aside
Boone slips away from them

PELOQUIN Damn you

He races after Boone who runs blindly his hand pressed to
the
wound on his neck

tatters There are hints that his once broken body poisoned
by

alcohol has taken on new strength He looks as insane as
Eigerman

but stronger in his lunacy Theres a dangerous fervour in
his eyes

Ashberry turns on him his face wild He takes hold of

by

the neck his fingers digging into the muscle Blood runs

tries to raise the gun but Ashberry takes hold of the mans
summarily snaps his wrist The gun is dropped Ashberry

starts to
lift Eigerman up off the ground The policemans flailings

stop
suddenly The head lolls Ashberry flings the body aside

and starts
out of the Necropolis As he approaches the exit he looks

up
Sunlight falls on his face
