Nadya manages to get up on shaky legs She staggers out of
the kitchen
BACK TO SCENE

Lenny peels away from the peephole He hurries into the --

BEDROOM

The bedroom is dark The only light comes through the window
The walls are covered in pictures but it’s too dark to make
out what they are of

Lenny removes a picture on the wall Behind it is a peephole
He peers through it

LENNY
What are you doing princess Don’t
be upset I’m right here

THROUGH PEEPHOLE

Nadya pulls the drawer out of the night stand Picks up a
prescription bottle
BACK TO SCENE
Lenny stares wide eyed through the peephole
LENNY
What is that No No What are you

doing

He dashes off into the --

BATHROOM

-- where he removes a towel from a towel rack Another
peephole is behind it

Lenny peeks through the tiny hole

THROUGH PEEPHOLE

Nadya appears in her bathroom She has her phone the pill
bottle and a bottle of wine She puts the bottles on the edge
of the tub Turns the water on

She sits down on top of the toilet dials a number She sobs
as she waits

NADYA
Please answer the phone Mike I
love youyou love me you know
that If you don’t answer I can’t
go on1I’1l end it right here
Now

She hangs up the phone

BACK TO SCENE
Lenny’s face is pressed to the wall

LENNY
Princess don’t talk like that
Don’t do anything stupid I’m right
here I’1l do anything for you

Lenny presses his face even harder against the wall Gasps
then quivers
THROUGH PEEPHOLE

Nadya takes her clothes off Slips into the tub She grabs
the pill bottle empties out the contents in her hand She
puts al the pills in her mouth washes them down with wine
straight from the bottle

Nadya lays her head back Closes her eyes

BACK TO SCENE
Lenny’s horrified He bangs his fist on the wall

LENNY
No

He pushes away from the wall Paces back and forth then peers
through the hole again

THROUGH PEEPHOLE

Nadya takes another mouthful of wine She’s groggy Her
eyelids heavy

BACK TO SCENE

Lenny runs out of the bathroom He returns in a few seconds
He has his cell phone in his hand

Lenny paces for a moment then stops He dials 91 He
hesitates Pushes “end call”

LENNY
They’d ask how I know

He hurries back to the peephole Peers through it
LENNY
NO Nadya Wake up
THROUGH PEEPHOLE
Nadya lies lifeless in the tub The wine bottle dropped on
the floor
BACK TO SCENE

Lenny staggers back from the wall in horror Suddenly he
rushes out of the bathroom into the --
FOYER

Lenny yanks the door open Darts outside

LATER

Lenny carries Nadya’s wet body wrapped in a towel He walks
into the --

BEDROOM

-- where he gently puts her body down on the bed Covers her
with the towel He carefully moves her wet hair away from her
face Kisses her forehead

Still dressed Lenny lies down on the bed next to Nadya He
takes her hand in his

LENNY
I loved you from the first time I
saw you I think about that moment
every day

He squeezes her hand

LENNY
You were going into your apartment
I was leaving mine You dropped
your mail and I picked it up and
handed it to you Your hand touched
mine and you looked me in the eyes
and smiled

He turns towards her Studies her face
LENNY
No girl has ever done that to me

before

They lie in the dark together

INT APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

Nadya are in the bed Lenny sleeps Nadya still dead

Nadya taken by an obsessed individual
