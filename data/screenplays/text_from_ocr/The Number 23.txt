(CONTTNUED )

WALTER
Feisty little foe arent you
Perhaps youd like to hear a story

He recounts the following in LOVING STYLE adding SUBTLE
GESTURES lulling the curious canine into a false sense of
security

WALTER
Once upon a time there lived a dog
Now this dog led a life of terror
fearing no one but over time he
realized though his teeth were
sharp and belly full his heart was
empty He wanted a friend

He starts inching strategically forward

WALTER
Alas all the other animals feared
this four-legged fiend so he set
off journeying this way and that
to lands far far away hoping to
find someone who knew not of his
reputation One day he happened
upon a small wooden shack with a
smokeless chimney above

He suspends the pole above NED

WALTER
The door hung open and inside sat
an old thin man His lonely eyes
matched the dogs heart and when he
beckoned it in the dog was
overjoyed That night smoke
drifted out the chimney but oh
what odd-smelling smoke this was
You see the land was China and in
China

In one swift movement WALTER whips the pole down the draw
string falling around Neds neck He yanks it tight

WALTER
THEY EAT DOGS

Ned SNARLS and BARKS WALTER pulls out the muzzle and waits
His prisoner calms

regulations state that any officer
suffering at the hands of an animal
must undergo psychological
counseling within seven days to
evaluate their state of mind

You dont seriously think Im going
to snap because some crafty little
canine chowed down on my arm

DR ALICE MORTIMER
A persons first bite can have
traumatic consequences

He rolls up his sleeve

This isnt trauma This is
stupidity I gave him my arm on a
platter Cant blame a species of
lower intelligence for that Thatd
be like shouting from the rooftops
after the time I let my wife choose

AGATHA sleeps WALTER awake watches the PATTERNS AND
SHADOWS on the ceiling and walls created by HEADLIGHTS
PASSING FROM THE STREET BELOW

The 23 book on the bedside table draws his attention
Suddenly THE SHADOWS on the wall seem to form A CREEPY TWO-
DIMENSIONAL FIGURE-LIKE SILHOUETTE -- almost as if PROJECTED
there by Walters imagination The Figure stares down at
Walter and Agatha then sweeps slowly across the walls towards
Agatha In its hands the outline of A LONG KNIFE appears It
raises the knife and thrusts downward violently over and
over again

WALTER sits upright knocking his bedside table Theres a
THUD He looks at the floor where the book has fallen FACE
UP the number 23 on its cover glinting in the half light

WALTER turns back to the walls -- now just innocent shadows
He stares back at the book strangely uneasy

toward Ned aiming Just before he can fire Ned bolts into
the graveyard

WALTER
This time you dont get away

EXT GRAVEYARD - CONTINUOUS
WALTER follows NED down row after row of graves

WALTER

Ned disappears around the other side of A GRAVE Our POV
shifts to behind WALTER as if someone follows him

He inches up Ned sitting on the GRAVE HOWLS

WALTER
Now now Dont cry Just you

He FIRES The dart sticks into Neds chest takes immediate
effect Now no more than a sleeping dog Ned seems quite
harmless WALTER softens and strokes his head

WALTER
Its okay boy Everythings gonna

Once upon a time there was this
noble entertaining dog

Suddenly he pauses calculating something in his mind

(CONTTNUED )

FH

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Ned

FATHER SEBASTIAN a commanding middle-aged priest brushes
past WALTER to Ned

FATHER SEBASTIAN
I trust theres an explanation for
this

WALTER
Hell be all right in a few hours
(curious )
Is this your dog

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He belongs to Barnaby my gardener

WALTER
Can I speak with him

FATHER SEBASTIAN
That depends Hows your sign
language

A confused WALTER turns around A man stands behind him
clutching A PAIR OF SHEARS This is BARNABY He is the
SILHOUETTE (from the earlier graveyard scene) and decidedly
more sinister-looking up close Not only does he have NO
TONGUE but also A LAZY EYE

FATHER SEBASTIAN
No one knows quite how he lost it
Some say he cut out his tongue
himself

WALTER
Is he harmless

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Yes He also understands everything
you say
Barnaby crouches down and strokes Ned
WALTER
Dont go getting all teary-eyed
Your dog bit me the other day

Barnaby pauses on hearing BIT

(CONTTNUED )

FATHER SEBASTIAN
But hes never bitten a soul
before Neds an angel

WALTER
Yeah Then whats this

He rolls up his sleeve revealing a festering BITE MARK

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Mr Sparrow if youre intention is
to sue the church I warn you God
makes a formidable foe

WALTER
Ask him if the number 23 means
anything to him

FATHER SEBASTIAN
As I said he understands what you
say

Barnaby (who is staring at WALTER) moves his hands Father
Sebastian translates (throughout scene)

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He says you must have done
something to provoke Ned for him to
bite you

WALTER
Just answer my question

Barnaby moves his hands again

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He says without the number 23 the
world would be in big trouble

WALTER
Why

FATHER SEBASTIAN
How would we get to twenty four
without it

WALTER

Funny guy huh Whyd you name him
Ned

(CONTTNUED )

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He didnt Ned was a stray when he
took him in He likes graveyards

Thats certainly true He sits and
stares at the stones like hes
watching over them Thats how he

got his nickname -- The Guardian
of the Dead

DR SIRIUS LEARY
You attempted to purge this
undeserved guilt on these tortured
pages and your subsequent loss of
memory and profound catatonia is
the result of a psychotic break
compounded by the recent death of
your parents

(with a smile)

But you will become a healthy and
