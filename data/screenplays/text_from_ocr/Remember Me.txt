1 EXT SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT
ts very late Its quiet Just the sounds of The City

LINDA SANTANA CRAIG an attractive Hispanic woman in her
thirties waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train

Linda looks great Shes dressed festively but tastefully
Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER ALICIA She is
twirling about the platform still jazzed from the birthday
party they attended in The City

Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink
handbag We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on
her right wrist

The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station
platform

TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end They speak soft
SLURRED SPANISH to each other

Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates She watches them
as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her moms open hand

The Boys approach Linda tenses At the last second the boys
make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell Its
quiet again Linda relaxes smiles at her daughter The F
TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station

fq

Their focus is on this train Its getting closer louder

And so they dont see dont hear the Boys coming back up the
stairwell behind them

Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and
the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his
gun

Linda puts her arm around her daughter Alicia looks
terrified

The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over
her purse her watch She hands over her engagement ring and
her wedding band

One of the boys yanks Alicias little purse away from her

The other boy fumbles the wedding band The ring CLANGS to
the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away

We hear MENS VOICES echoing up the stairwell

Now the Boys are boxed in And starting to panic

-- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --

The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail
car leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform

Through the window on the train Linda stares at the boy
holding her daughters purse her face hardening into a MASK
OF CONTEMPT

The boy clocks it Who does she think she is

-- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --

When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the
car doors from closing

A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car
Theres a muzzle flash a distant POP a cloud of smoke
a mist of blood and Lindas body collapses on itself

Alicias face shock terror and blood

EXT SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT -- MOS

A WORKING CRIME SCENE lots of uniforms and light a white
sheet draped over Lindas body where it fell

BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a
man is taking the stairs two at a time Late thirties big
plain clothes he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG When he reaches
the platform he stops

Craig kneels before the white sheet Peels it back We stay
on him We dont see what he sees We just see how he sees
it Then he turns

THE WEDDING BAND Its been tagged and numbered as evidence
Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it
into his pocket

Alicia wrapped in a blanket standing next to a round police
MATRON The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicias face
Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him her
legs not quite working

Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her lifting
her as the blanket falls to the ground

Alicia makes little gasping noises Trying to speak but
cant

Craig walking back now carrying his entire world He reaches
the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee Alicia gasps

The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm A moment
Composure A deep breath Then as quickly as he went down
hes back up

Craig looks back now taking it all in Is it real Sees all
the cops looking at him then begins down the stairs

WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a
clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan where the TWIN
TOWERS STAND TALL

INT LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING
SUBTITLE Eight Years Later

Tiny kitchen clutter a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on
the wall a lot of books There is a PHONE RINGING under the
bed

TYLER ROTH early twenties handsome looking haggard He is
sitting on the floor shirtless bed head wrapped in a
blanket A GUITAR is on his lap Tyler has propped some well
worn hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand
laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes frustration
etched in his face
A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed

Tyler not a born musician is trying to teach himself one of
the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him He is completely lost
in the moment with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers By the
ASHTRAY next to him we can tell hes been at this a couple
of hours

The Blonde in the bed re the ringing phone

BLONDE
(out of it)
Hello

Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the
phone simultaneously glancing at the digital clock His eyes
widen in alarm

TYLER
Yeah
(listens)
Of course Im on my way I
knowI knowI knowI know

Tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark
suit pants Before he pulls on his white undershirt we
observe a TATTOO that simply says Michael over his heart

He searches through a beat-up chest of drawers seeking a
reasonably clean button down shirt

TYLER VO
Gandhi said that whatever you do in
life will be insignificant but it
is very important that you do it

And scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an
expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher
brush

TYLER VO
I tend to agree with the first
part

EXT GREEN WOOD CEMETERY --BROOKLYN -- LATER

A cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the
distance They are not in funeral dress as this is not a
funeral Its a memorial

A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls toa
stop From the trees and the sky we know its LATE
SPRINGEARLY SUMMER A gorgeous day

Tyler gets out of the cab holding the rim of his empty
coffee cup in his teeth He sorts a rumpled wad of singles
and hands some to the driver who screeches into reverse
Time is money

Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket
pocket then lights up a smoke He takes one long drag then
extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket He begins
towards the mourners

His mother DIANE HOFFMAN a beauty Past burdens etched in
the lines on her face Dressed tastefully in expensive
bohemian She smiles like someone whos been crying but
doesnt want anyone to know she has

TYLER
(sweetly)
Hello your majesty How are you

DIANE
Im fine you look good

He kisses his mothers hand and hes moving to greet his
stepfather

LES HOFFMAN Unruly curls streaked in gray tweed jacket and

tie They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos

The weight of Tylers gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH his
diminutive bespectacled eleven year old sister Shes
holding a little paper bag

She flashes him a look He kneels besides her and whispers

TYLER
Thanks for organizing everybody

Caroline makes a face Turns her nose away from him

CAROLINE
You smell like Listerine and beer

He snorts and kisses her cheek
Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of
smooth white stones on which she has painted the names
Mom Tyler Les Dad Caroline She begins to arrange
them in a little circle on the grave

Tylers father

CHARLES ROTH late fifties breathes power precisely
dressed two hundred dollar haircut A predator

CHARLES
(aside to Tyler)
You couldnt wear a tie

Tyler holds his fathers eye

TYLER
Could have

Beat
Charles adjusts his own collar like its an explosive

POV The Tombstone The four adult family members stand side-
by-side They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline
sits on the ground arranging the stones

5 INT JUNIORS RESTAURANT-- BROOKLYN -- AFTER

The family sits together in a booth Tyler rolls a Bic
lighter over his knuckles Caroline draws a funny portrait of
Tyler on her napkin He is smoking nine cigarettes at once
Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention Les is

eyeing the Cheesecake Charles subtly aligns his silverware

DIANE
This is nice I think its
nice that we still do this

CAROLINE
(gently)
Mom

DIANE
I forgot Im trying to purge
nice from my vocabulary Michael
would like that we still do this

Tyler takes out a cigarette Lights it Without saying a word
his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass

DIANE
(to Caroline)
Did you tell Tyler what your art
teacher said about your portrait

Caroline as bemused as an eleven year old can be looks at
her mother then at her brother She adopts a very motherly
tone

CAROLINE
Tyler did I tell you what my art
teacher said about my portrait

TYLER
Why no Caroline What did your art
teacher say about your portrait

DIANE
(smiling)
You two I quit

She flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les
hand

CAROLINE
She was very impressed She said
I captured a moment like a young
James Whistler

The WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to
the table Les dives in Charles is having toast He sips a
glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek
Phillippe

TYLER
Young Whistler good cause
Whistler really fell off late in
his career Hes the Michael
Jackson of European art history

DIANE
She suggested your sister take
Pratts Summer Art Intensive and
thats hugely prestigious

Caroline looks a bit sheepish Tyler high fives Caroline

Diane again flickers a glance at Charles
Beat

CAROLINE
I would be the youngest one ever
practically

CHARLES
Tyler would you please pass the
butter

DIANE
Caroline was speaking

TYLER
(to Charles)
Are you really this clueless Are
you really dismissing her like
this

Diane touches Carolines hair

Beat

CHARLES
Caroline is perfectly capable of
speaking up if she is feeling
dismissed Caroline are you
feeling dismissed

CAROLINE
Im okay

CHARLES
(solicitous to Caroline)
I didnt mean to change the
subject

TYLER
What was the subject

CHARLES
Excuse me

TYLER
The subject we were discussing
What was it

CHARLES

Nows not the time for your heroics
Tyler

TYLER
No Its the perfect time

Charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar
Father and son lock eyes until
TYLER
(whispering to Caroline)
Do you need me to take you
anywhere

Caroline shakes her head

CAROLINE
Ill stay with mom

Diane glares at her ex-husband
Tyler rises and kisses his sisters forehead

TYLER
Then Ill see you after school

CAROLINE
Kay

He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade avoiding everybodys
eyes

INT SUBWAY CAR -- JUST AFTER

Tyler standing although there are a few seats available The

car window strobes behind him He takes off his jacket and
button down and ties them both around his waist

INT WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER

Tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out
of place amidst all the business types

He sits in the last booth facing the street His tattered
JOURNAL lies open in front of him a BINDER CLIP holds his

page as he works quietly crafting an entry

The HOSTESS tired in her 60s slides a piece of baklava on
the table as she shuffles past

HOSTESS
Eat something

Tyler gives her a huge grin
TYLER

Yes maam

Tyler and his roommate AIDAN BREWER 22 energetic
inappropriate walking west towards NYU Young people in
easy summery dress Tyler smokes Aidan doesnt Aidan
remembers something smirks

AIDAN
I sold your girlfriend a
toothbrush
TYLER
You sold my who What
AIDAN

That voluptuous delightfully
oblivious little blonde you left in
your bed this morning I sold her
a toothbrush Got three bucks

TYLER
-Congratulations

AIDAN
Are in order yes Because that
sale inspired our newest business
venture The SLUT

TYLER
I was unaware we had a previous

business venture

AIDAN
The Single Ladys Universal Tote
Its the one-night-stand travel
pack for women We throw in some
make-up toiletries cell phone
charger cab numbers Retail it at
1995 maybe do an infomercial

TYLER
And you think women would buy this
With money

AIDAN
Hey one-night-stands happen Its
a part of life like stubbing

your toe Sometimes you misjudge a
corner and bend back your pinky
toe other times you wake up ina
freshman dorm wearing a field
hockey tee shirt wondering why your
balls smell like cinnamon

TYLER
(nodding sagely)
Of course Yes

AIDAN
Dont underestimate the novelty
gift market Think about it
instead of giving that token slutty
friend a ten-inch purple dildo for
her birthday you hook her up with
The SLUT Everyone has a laugh
and the implication that shell
probably use it someday remains
What do you say Are you down

TYLER
Im down with getting you on some
sort of medication

AIDAN
OKfinebe cynicaljust
remember at some point in history
two people had a conversation just
like this about the light bulb One
of them went on to fame and fortune
and the other one probably went to
work at Mickey Ds or something

TYLER
Or Dennys Dennys was big in the
19th century

Caroline sees them through the tinted glass They couldnt
see her even if they wanted to

PROFESSOR (0S)
Its an unfortunate reality but a
reality nonetheless

INT LECTURE HALL -- NYU --DAY 11

TYLER sits in the back of the room Their PROFESSOR addresses
the few students paying attention

PROFESSOR
in the wake of terrorist attacks
these insurance company actuaries
are provided a unique opportunity
to raise premiums and profits to
protect against events that will
likely never occur again

One girl a focused brunette with beautiful eyes takes notes
relentlessly She is present absorbing the material She
raises her hand

GIRL
Isnt that also an ethical
question

Tyler shoots her a glance He takes in her lovely face her
casual dress and the CHARM BRACELET with its four leaf
clovers WE REALIZE this is Alicia Ally Craig now 19

Tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- AFTERNOON 12

At the Alice in Wonderland statue where KIDS climb all over
the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters

The statue is warm the bronze absorbing the late spring sun
Tyler is perched on the Mad Hatter his face turned towards
the sun while Caroline hides with the dormouse

Tyler lights a cigarette AN UPTIGHT MOMMY glares at him

UPTIGHT MOMMY

CAROLINE

CAROLINE
Why do you think Dad doesnt
wannalike listen to me
TYLER

Dad loves you
Caroline gives him a look

CAROLINE
So You can love someone and not
want to spend any time with them

Caroline is climbing around Alice Her hands on Alices hair

TYLER
Youve got that right

CAROLINE
Mom loves Aunt Sara But at
Christmas last year she wouldnt
let Les leave them in a room
together cause she said there
would be a yule tide homicide

TYLER
Thats because Aunt Sara drinks

CAROLINE
Duh
TYLER
So why would anyone wanna avoid
you

Caroline shrugs not convinced A silent moment passes

CAROLINE
Michael used to drink

TYLER
Yeah He did But Michael was 21
All 21 year olds drink because its
new and exciting Aunt Sara drinks
because she wishes she was 21

A shared smile

CAROLINE
Youre 21

Tylers smile fades

far away a ghostly plaintive girls voice disappearing into
the night

VOICE 0S
MichaelMi-i-chael

Tyler turns towards the sound Its as if hes trying to spot
a train in the distance His hand goes to his pocket and
fishes out his pack of cigarettes

AIDANS GIRL
(to Aidan)
Asshole
She walks away looking back at her friend annoyed

AIDANS GIRL
Are you coming

Tylers Girl looks at Tyler who is still preoccupied

TYLERS GIRL
(to her friend)
Hold on Lauren

The girls step away Tylers Girl appears to be trying to
convince her friend to stay Aidan watches them hopefully

Tyler isnt watching them Hes watching two cool looking
MUSICIANS crossing the street with the LIGHT carrying SOUND
EQUIPMENT

A quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of
them in a car aggressive music playing The Neanderthal at
the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch
the car forward startling the musicians toying with them

MUSICIAN 1 glares but gives no further response he just
wants to get across the street The Neanderthal revs and
lurches again

MUSICIAN 2 slams his hand on the hood of the car

MUSICIAN2
Whats your problem

NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
My problem Keep your hands off my
car asshole

MUSICIAN2
Blow it out your ass Guido

MUSICIAN1
Go back to Long Island

The cars four doors open and the Neanderthals lope to the
front of the car The driver is holding a mini baseball bat
at his side

NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
Im from Queens faggot
A Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians and the driver
starts wailing on the other with the bat Tyler watches as
the Neanderthals overpower them The altercation has turned
into a full on assault The Musicians are getting stomped
into the pavement

TYLERS GIRL
So we were thinking we could go

Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her

AIDAN
(under his breath)
God damn it

Aidan runs off after Tyler

Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it swinging grabbing
the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the
guys face He fights like a pit bull Not feeling not
stopping

Aidan gets punched in the face Tyler elbows the nose of the
guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood Then someone hits
Tyler in the gut and he doubles over and takes a knee to the
chin The musicians get back to their feet and fight back
Its a brawl

Aidans girl is screaming for the cops Tylers girl

following the instincts of the inebriated has teetered near

enough to the brawl to imperil herself

A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses grazing the girl

She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement

splitting her lip on impact Tyler head butts the guy

16 EXT SIDE STREET -- LATER
An AMBULANCE and TWO EMTS are on site

THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb

SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG a little older and heavier than when we

first met him at the train station is standing with the
Girl who is a mess Her nose bloody her dress torn

Craig shields the Girl with his body listening carefully to

her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the
Neanderthals Craigs eyes flicker in the same direction

Craigs PARTNER LEO AFRICAN AMERICAN a few years younger
is on the radio to Dispatch

Craig snaps his fingers at one of the EMTs and receives a
blanket which he carefully wraps around the girl Then to
his partner indicating Tyler and Aidan

CRAIG
Cut those two loose

Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys

LEO

CRAIG

Aidan gives Tylers elbow a gentle tug Tylers caught up in
the action

NEANDERTHAL1

Rage flickers across Craigs face

Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians going
through their pockets

CRAIG

He turns back to work

Tyler looks briefly at Aidan Aidan looks desperate Please

Tyler TOUCHES CRAIGS ELBOW

Aidans jaw drops Leo takes several silent steps in Craig
looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler The kid must be
out of his mind

TYLER
How about you do your job

pavement a GASH opens above Tylers LEFT EYE Tyler lies
there dazed and disoriented as Craig with one knee on
Tylers neck crushes his face into the ground He slaps the
cuffs on

EXT PRIVATE SCHOOL JUST AFTER 25

CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS One of them dips her head towards

snicker

Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car His bike leans on
a fire hydrant

TYLER
(to Caroline)
Hey

He looks at the girls sizing them up and flicks his
cigarette to the sidewalk cool as hell The girls have a
group swoon

He takes Caroline by the elbow

He gives her a charming smile

ALLY
Youre already bothering me

ALLY
Anonymous Its Greek It means
you dont have a shot

A surprised laugh escapes from Tyler

TYLER
Okay Anonymous do you see the guy
across the room pretending to read
a text book looking in this
general direction

Aidan holds a MATH TEXTBOOK at an awkward angle to mask his
obvious interest in Ally and Tylers conversation

ALLY
Subtle

TYLER
I have this theory that an
objective third-party having no
prior contact would be able to
determine how much of an asshole
he is just by looking at him

ALLY
Ah

TYLER
Hes my roommate And Ive
witnessed so many glaring examples
of assaholic behavior that Im
biased as a subject but Im
convinced that he has an aura that
people can actually perceive So
just take a good long look And
tell me what you think

She looks at Aidan briefly who shifts to avoid her gaze
Then she takes a peek at Tylers profile

ALLY
Who else do you plan on asking

TYLER
No one here The parameters called
only to sample attractive women in
their early twenties

ALLY
Im nineteen

TYLER

In their late teens

(beat)
Well look you typically get
something for participating in
these things and Ive run out of
those big foam fingers so I was
thinking maybe I could take you out

some night
She looks at him

TYLER
Or you could just go out with me on
the off chance wed have an
interesting conversation

ALLY
I dont date sociology majors
theyre a rowdy bunch

TYLER
Indeed they are Lucky for you Im
undecided
