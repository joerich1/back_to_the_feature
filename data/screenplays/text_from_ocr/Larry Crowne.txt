From a story by

Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos

Nov 2009
FADE IN

SUNRISE

Big and orange and full of hope as sure as fate A dawn as
promising as well this new day
Sun is rising over

A flat roof that stretches to the horizon A vast expanse
A plain of gravel-embedded tar studded with

HVAC units and power lines the kind that service a huge
commercial building In fact this kind of building

A UNIMART store A flagship of savings a mother lode of
low low prices 100000-and-then-some square feet of the
Consumer Economy

PARKING LOT

Empty thus far A few EMPLOYEE autos arriving in their
assigned slots far from the entrance One of those cars is a
old not so vintage nor classic convertible

KARMANN GHIA -- Belonging to

LARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable (and predictable) as that
rising sun
Actually hes a Team Leader of this Unimart dressed in his
un-sexy un-fashionable un-flattering khaki pants and
Company Polo

Larry has had the ragtop down He wrestles it up locks the
cover into place

He doesnt just walk to work but s t r ides across the

asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales a Viscount of
Discount

He cheers co-workers at the start of the day shouting

encouragement flashing thumbs up knocking on car doors and

squeezing shoulders

LARRY CROWNE

On his scooter Heading towards the Scooter parking

She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the
memory of last night warrants it She heads in that

direction
EXT ECCC CAMPUS - SAME

Mercy is trying to accidentally run into Larry but is
caught by surprise when

He is walking right towards her Oops That would be
uncomfortable She DUCKS behind a pillar

Still wanting to bump into the man who kissed her last
night she circumvents his path stalking Larry like a
birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow

Hopping behind a tree Mercys SHOE gets caught in some mud
Bending down a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam
Stepping onto the pavement the tree branch SMACKS her in

head
Still she keeps and eye on Larry And pursues

BENCH AREA

Staying out of his eye line Mercy navigates her way around
to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance
before making a 180 degree reverse guaranteeing a Meet
with Larry

Then she sees her

TALIA

Sitting with others greeting Larry with laughter and hugs
and hoots Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry
with a drunken teacher last night with her arm around his
waist and affection in her eyes

MERCY
Is crushed For the obvious reasons sh s ill cant
understand She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a
minute or two

TALIA AND LARRY

Amid the others

TALIA

Oh come on I left you all set
up What went down

LARRY CROWNE
Epilog School today

TALIA
Lance A Betty on your Scooter
after midnight Holding on her
arms around you pressed against
your back is a license to at least
cop a feel

LARRY CROWNE
If we had ended up making out you
still wouldnt hear it
Talia slugs him All in play

MERCY

Convinced Larry is gossiping about last night Mercy backs
away from the scene and slinks away toward her class

INT SPEECH 217 - DAY

Mercedes is in the back wearing the darkest glasses allowed
a teacher in a classroom hiding the fact that Mercy is
looking at Larry

Larry is listening to Lala with delight

PINEDO
Seeing them -- the Northern Lights
the Aurora Borealis -- should have

been beyond me but I was a little
girl in Coach class still awake a
window seat a moonless night
somewhere over Greenland with a
shimmering curtain of emerald
gossamer light dancing just for me

(THEN)
That is something I will remember
forever
The SPEECH is over The class erupts in applause for Lala
who has hit a home-run Foremost of the fans Larry who
rises in applause for the once quiet classmate
Then the applause is over
The teacher says nothing DIBIASI

That was a knockout speech Lala

Made the news Caused riots

MERCEDES TAINOT

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONTD)

LAMARR

whistles

EXT TATTOO PARLOR - STAIRS TO UPPER FLOOR
Music is playing A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives

a nice little porch On a little table sits a potted plant
In the potted plant is an Altoids tin
Mercy gives it a rattle In the tin a brand new key

Mercy takes the key Slides it into the lock and slowly
opens the door
The music gets louder She cant see much into the tiny
post-

flat but she can make out
Larry arranging the last of his stuff
Mercy stands at the door until he sees her

When he does he says nothing But steps to her and smells
her - her neck her hair

MERCEDES TAINOT

class changed your life

INT LARRY CROWNES APARTMENT - KITCHEN

No larger than the nook of his old house Breakfast is being
served

The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made
French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook

Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head --

Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving His arm shows a Navy tattoo that
may be old or new

Mercy Tainot glows in and out She slides next to him close
to him The meal is perfect

EXT HARBOR BLVD - LATER

Mercy is still in her robe riding on Larrys scooter back
and forth in front of the Parlor and Talias store

Larry is having coffee sitting on the steps watching her
ride back and forth

She is getting good

Talia and the gang spill out of the store to watch her
Hoots and laughter
Larry uses his robe as a matadors cape Mercy as the bull

As she passes under his flaring cape

THE END
