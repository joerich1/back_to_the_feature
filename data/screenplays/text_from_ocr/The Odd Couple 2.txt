INT PLANE - DAY

FELIX UNGAR full face CLOSE UP He blows his nose
loudly into a Kleenex then makes that sheep bleating
sound to clear his nasal passages Then a couple of
those “Mwow Mwow” sounds with his throat

WE ARE IN A PLANE

Felix is sitting in economy between a man and a WOMAN
They look annoyed at his constant symptoms

FELIX
(smiles apologetically)
Sorry Sorry

A STEWARDESS passes by

FELIX (CONTD)

Into the non-smoking section

STEWARDESS
The entire plane is non-smoking

attendants who clean out che planes
in the airport were smoking in here

STEWARDESS

He follows her down the aisle then stops her

FELIX
(lowers his voice)
It’s not just the smoke The woman
next to me is wearing a perfume that

I have a definite allergy to

STEWARDESS
I already moved you once

FELIX
No that was because of a hair
spray I know I sound crazy but Im
one of those hyper-allergenic cases

STEWARDESS
You mean sniff every woman in the
plane until you find a perfume

seat The woman next to him looks at him as he begins to
clear his throat

WOMAN

If it got stuck I could be dead in
two minutes

He smiles and shrugs She nods She takes out her
cologne spray and sprays behind her ear lightly

WOMAN
I hate to see someone uncomfortable

Felix presses his finger against his left nostril so as
not to breathe in the fumes It makes him speak nasally

FELIX

mine I havent seen him in years

The man on his right takes out some after-shave lotion
from his case and pats some on his face Felix looks
then presses his right finger on his right nostril so
that both nostrils are now closed

WOMAN
So your daughter and his son have
known each other before

FELIX

nasal)

Angeles He’s an actor she’s an

stupid thing like that

OSCAR
I had them on my lap so I could read
them lit my cigar and the hot

ashes fell on my crotch the map
caught fire I had the choice of
finding the house or burning up one
of the most important parts of my
body Guess which I picked

FELIX
Why the hell didn’t you wake me up

OSCAR

burning map trying to steer a car
at sixty-five miles an hour with a
lit cigar in my mouth and yell “Oh
Felix Would you wake up please’

FELIX
Unbelievable So whyd you get off
the Freeway

OSCAR
Because the directions said go north
on the 105 and then turn off on exit

-- and that’s when the directions
caught fire

off

trunk and looks

THE TRUNK

We see Oscars old battered suitcase but that’s all

FELIX
I’m going to try to stay very calm
through the next sentence I’m going
to say

(MORE)

FELIX (CONT’D)
If it’s not in the trunk WHERE THE
HELL IS MY GODDAMN SUITCASE

OSCAR
This is just a wild guess but Id
say it’s standing in front of the
Budget Rent-A-Car office

FELIX
In Los Angeles

OSCAR
That‘s a good guess too

FELIX
Then why didn’t you stop the car and
go back

OSCAR
Go back It took us two hours to
get to here It would take us five
hours to go back there because I
don’t know how the hell we got here
in the first place And if I did go
back wed have to make three stops
for you to pee to get locked in the
john to pay another kid another
five bucks and then wed stop for
you to eat again take your pills
and then tell me what youve been
doing with your life for the last
seventeen years does that answer
your question

Oscar crosses to him

shirts two pairs of socks an
ironing board and a tube of spot
remover I’1l1 pay you back

FELIX
(his eyes look up)
In that suitcase is the black
afternoon formal suit I bought to
wear when I give my daughter away in
marriage In the suitcase was the
six thousand dollar silver Tiffany
tray I bought as a wedding gift
(MORE) 42

FELIX (CONT‘D)
In that suitcase was ten thousand
dollars in cash I intended to give
to my son-in-law on his wedding day
Now in your suitcase the police
will find your broken smashed
mutilated and dissected body in the
event that you don’t go back and
find my fucking suitcase

OSCAR
Why don’t we call Budget and ask
them to deliver it

FELIX
Deliver it to where You‘ve criss
crossed California more than the
covered wagons did a hundred years
ago What do you we tell them
Follow the burnt pieces of
directions on the Freeway

OSCAR
Well drive to the first town we see
and then we’ll call Budget

FELIX
That was my good leather suitcase
How long do you think it’s going to
stand out there on the street
unclaimed There’s someone going to
have pepperoni pizza tonight on my
daughter’s silver Tiffany tray

Oscar moves back towards the car The car is sitting on

a hill

OSCAR
Come on Get back in the car If
it’s still there they have new
things today that get them to you
fast Like Federal Express or
UPS or er er a fax

PELIX
Fax my suitcase You mean I could
wear a picture of my black wedding

suit Paper copies of ten thousand
dollars cash

He walks menacingly towards Oscar

OSCAR
Dont get physical Felix I’m too
old to hit but could spit vou to

death
FELIX

I just want to know why why when
you get around me you behave like a
goddamn

(bangs top of car with

his hand)
Idiotic

(bangs it again)
Imbecilic

(bangs it again)
Total moronic
(bangs it again)
SHITHEAD
(on shithead he gives
in one final bang)

The car slowly starts to move backward down the hill
They both stand there transfixed as it rolls faster and
further down the hill over an embankment crashes

catches fire and explodes They watch it Then Felix
looks at Oscar

FELIX
Didn’t you put the brakes on

OSCAR
Why I didn’t know you were going
to punch it

They watch it burn

FELIX
Well we’d better call Budget and
have them fax us another car

EXT A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 4€

Farm country actually It is a four way intersection
growing crops all around Oscar and Felix in the
intersection looking in all four directions Not a sign
of life

FELIX
(lecks up at sign
pointing in all four
directions)
Los Pintos Los Brisas Los
Pecos Sound familiar

OSCAR
Yeah Theyre hotels in Acapulco

FELIX
Look a car has to come from some
direction You stand here I’‘ll
stand on the other side of the road

OSCAR
So we can catch all the heavy
traffic at five o’clock at Los
Pecos

FELIX

Felix crosses to the opposite side of the road Oscar
stands at the other one

They both are watching the same road from cpposite

directions Theyre really not paying much attention to
the roads that intersect them

EXT ROAD - DAY
The hot sun overhead
The two of them standing there
FELIX
(calls over)
You see anything yet
OSCAR
Yeah for a minute I thought I saw
Omar Sharif on a camel

They stand watching again

Then suddenly seemingly out of nowhere a sports car
goes whizzing by as fast as the Road Runner and

disappears out of sight Oscar and Felix look at each
other

Then from the opposite side of the same road another car
whizzes by even faster and out of sight leaving a traii
of dust

Oscar and Felix then move and stand on opposite sides of
the road where the cars whizzed by

Then we hear the drone of a motor They both peer down
the road The motor gets LOUDER

FELIX
I hear something You hear that

OSCAR
With our luck it’s the Killer Bees
from Brazil

The SOUND becomes a roar and before they can see it a
biplane flies directly overhead and drops a white
insecticide powder It covers everything When the
Plane leaves and the powder clears Oscar and Felix are

standing in the exact positions covered from head to toe
with white powder

FELIX
What the hell was that

OSCAR
They purposely did it They hate
New Yorkers

Felix crosses over to Oscars side as they try to little
avail dusting the powder off themselves

FELIX

Suddenly from the opposite direction we see a speeding
dirty old pick-up truck coming in a cloud of dust They
screech to a halt and wave to the Fruit Driver who also
stops

Two men in the pick-up One motions to the Fruit Driver
to get out and come to them He does then gets into a
frenzied conversation with them in Spanish which we
can’t hear

FELIX
to Oscar)

He smiles and waves back The helicopter drops lower and
the officer motions up ahead

rush for the fruit truck

FELIX
(to Oscar)

The police take off the cases from the back of the truck

After the top cases are gone we see a large tarpaulin
tied down They untie it and pull it away Twenty
illegal aliens come out with their nands up

OFFICER
(to Felix and Oscar)

California Immigration Law 1407 for

to pull a dead body back in

FELIX
Will you get out and push his head
back in for Chrissakes I can’t
move

Because a car drives by and HONKS Oscar gets out on the
side of the roadside so as not to get hit As he’s
outside a huge truck whizzes by and the wind blows the
toupee off the dead man Oscar doesn’t see it as he
comes around the car so that now he sees the dead man
with no hair

OSCAR
Hey This guy is starting to
decompose already

FELIX
His hairpiece flew off Go back and
get it

OSCAR
Why He’s dead Who does he have

to look good for

yells)

The bird flies off but takes the hairpiece with him in
his beak

OSCAR (CONTD)

A bigger truck whizzes by this time and the strong wind
blows the Elderly Man back in the car but his head fails
on Felix’s lap Oscar goes back around the car and gets
in the back seat again All he can see is Felix

OSCAR (CONT’D)

Oo

DETECTIZ
Whats the point No matter what

Would it be possible to find out the
results of the second race at
Hollywood Park I’ve got a trifecta
going

2” DETECTI
A what

OSCAR
A trifecta Youve got to pick the
three winning horses in the exact
order chat they finished

FELIX
I dont believe this Weve gota
wedding we can’t get to and all he
has on his mind is a trifecra

DETECTIVE
(leeks at Oscar)
I’ll tell you who won

OSCAR
You know
DETECTIVE
Yes 2 won You’re my trifecta

The same two men have been arrested
Shree times for shree differenr
crimes and all three times by my
men In less than fourteen hours
You know what the odds are on that
happening In any police station in
the world

OSCAR
Roughly Id say twelve million to
one

DETECTIVE

And what would it be if it happened
in a small sheriffs office in a

little town called Santa Menendez
California

a9

w
NO

OSCAR
It would be in the trillions No
bookie could handle it

FELIX
Oscar of all the differences weve
ever had of all the fight weve
ever had of all the petty arguments
weve ever had --

OSCAR
(to Detective)
We can keep on talking ‘cause he’ll
be on this a half hour

FELIX
-- Of all the times I wanted to
choke you by the throat this is the
worst If you say trifecta one
more time I’m going to choke you
until you’re dead and he can arrest
me one more time for one more
crime and one more time in his
office Then he’1ll have a FOUR-
FECTA So SHUT THE FUCK UP
OKAY

OSCAR
That would be the biggest payoff in
the world

FELIX
What would

OSCAR
A four-fecta There isn‘t a
racetrack in the world thac --

Felix jumps off of his chair and goes for Oscar’s throat
but the 2“ Detective grabs him and holds him back

The night before my wedding I tried

Because I don’t trust marriage

then never again for thirty years
Hers were too many and yours noc
enough Whats wrong with ic that
frightens everyone so much

couldn’t play and your mother could

Play but she kept getting traded all
the time

for

wanted Until I saw all the
