the CD player and puts on her Mozart

INT BEDROOM AREA - A FEW HOURS LATER 12

Jane emerges from the shower sans make up She goes to the
make up counter where everything has been put neatly in
alphabetical order by Eddie She accidently knocks a jar
from its aligned space Hastily she looks around fearful
that Eddie might notice She nudges it back into place

She wipes the fog off the mirror Her bruises from the day
before are clearly visible She frowns and begins applying
make up It’s not covering it up She puts on more and
more The thick make up is now more obvious than the bruise
She speaks in a mantra to herself

JANE
I love my husband I do love him

EXT DARKNESS OF A BARELY LIT ROOM -- LATER 13
Across the street the night lights of the liquor store go on
and off as the hours pass Jane sits in the rocking chair

in thought

The dinner table is perfectly set The candles have burned
low She anxiously watches the street

Eddie stands there just staring

PARAMEDIC 1

Eddie jolts from his trance

PARAMEDIC 2

Eddie leans forward Swallows hard

PARAMEDIC 1
She’s alive

Eddie rubs his hands together impatiently looks to the door
eyeing an escape The tone sounds again Then again The
HEART BEAT of the baby can be heard through the dopler

No Its the baby The baby’s heart
is beating

Paramedic 1 takes the dopler and places it again on the
stomach
