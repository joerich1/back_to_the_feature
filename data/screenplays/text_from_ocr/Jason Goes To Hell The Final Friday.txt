FADE IN

1 EXT CRYSTAL LAKE - DUSK
Were rapidly moving across the water skimming towards the
dark woods on the far shore

2 EXT BACK ROADINT TOYOTA CELICA - DUSK
ELIZABETH MARCUS drives her Toyota Celica along this heavily
wooded road Shes a young woman innocent looking sweet
and pretty

The light is fading Shadows begin to overtake the land

She is obviously some place remote A sign caught briefly

in her headlights says CRYSTAL LAKE - 4 MILES Elizabeth
swings the car around a barely seen curve in the road She
pulls up

3 EXT DESERTED CABIN - DUSK

Elizabeth parks the Toyota She gets out takes a look at
the cabin

A FOR RENT sign hangs tacked to the porch at an angle
The place looks dark dirty uninviting

She moves to her rear door opens it and bends in to get her
over-night bag Behind her the darkness gapes with the
ominous threat of violence

She comes back out of the car and moves to the cabin A
porch swing rotted and unusable BANGS METHODICALLY against
the old wood of the house Elizabeth fumbles for the keys
and drops them

As she bends down to pick off the FOR RENT sign snaps it
chain and swings down missing her neck by inches

Startled she rips the sign off and tosses it onto the porch
with a LOUD BANG

INT DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

Elizabeth enters The place is damp and dank A layer of
moldy dust has gathered Shadows obscure the corners of the
room

Elizabeth put down her bag and gropes the wall for a switch
She finds one Flips it The light turns on for a few brief
momentsthen sputters and goes out

ELIZABETH
Shit

She turns and goes back outside

EXT DESERTED CABIN - DUSK

Elizabeth walks slowly around the cabin towards a decrepit
old woodshed at the edge of a dark unfriendly woods She
slowly opens the doora mossy ladder rests against the far
wall

Elizabeth enters and walks towards the ladder Suddenly the
woodshed door BANGS CLOSED Elizabeth SHRIEKS then
scrabbling at the door flings it open and rushes outside
with the ladder

There is a RUSTLE off among the trees She hesitates again
Footsteps on dry leaves Just a gust of wind off the lake

With a last look over her shoulder she drags the ladder back
towards the cabin and enters

INT DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth comes back in with the ladder She picks up her
bag removes a four pack of bulbs and climbing on the

ladder replaces the bulb in the living room The light
comes onbut its scant illumination against the dark night

Suddenly her foot slips on the slimy step of the ladder and
she drops the old bulb which SHATTERS LOUDLY on the floor

Grimacing Elizabeth climbs down the ladder and quickly
sweeps up the broken glass Having done that she shuts the
front door all the way then puts her bag on the bed and
opens it She takes out a few pairs of jeans and some shirts
and moves to the standing wardrobe
We know that she will open the doors of that wardrobe and
come face to face with her death

She opens the wardrobe
Nothingjust a moth

She puts her clothes away The sound of a branch SCRAPING
against the side of the cabin adds to the tension Now she
turns

there is no one waiting there in the doorway

Elizabeth yawns stretches and walks up the stairwell to the
second floor landing which leads into a pitch black hallway

INT DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT

She moves down the hallway then enters the bathroom and
turns on the light Crossing to the bathtub she bends down
and turns on the hot water It comes spitting out brackish
and brown at first then finally clear

e stays bent over the tub letting the dirty water run
own the drain Then she puts the plug in filling the tub
or a bath As it fills she undresses down to the her
-shirt and underwear

Homan

a

e looks over to discover that the medicine cabinet door is
open She crosses to it and closes it

This has got to be the one She will close that door and
there reflected in the mirror will be

Â»-nothing just the dim illumination of the bathroom light

a

e bends down to test the temperature of the tub water
Its good

She removes her underwear and t-shirt then puts one foot in
the water testing it then eases into the comforting warmth

The light in the bathroom sputters and then burns out

Elizabeth SIGHS resigned then continues climbing into the
tub when -- WHAM

INT DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The front door blows open banging into the wall

INT DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth turns startled She grabs her towel (brushing by
her makeup bag) and wrapping the towel around her walks
slowly down the dark hallway onto the landing

From downstairs she HEARS A NOISE

INT CABIN - NIGHT

Bending precariously far out over the landing she looks down
onto the first floor

HER POV

Nothing but the stirring of leaves blowing into the cabin
through the open doorway

ON ELIZABETH

as a cool breeze from the doorway makes her shiver Slowly
she moves towards the stairs when we HEAR THAT SOUND AGAIN
from downstairs What the hell is it Once again she leans
far out over the landing

HER POV

Still nothing Leaves The WHINE OF THE WIND

ON ELIZABETH

looking -- something must have made that noise Then
suddenly from the perfect darkness behind her JASON
VOORHEES steps out hockey mask in place machete sharp and
ready

Elizabeth stands back up OBSCURING JASON FROM VIEW

CLOSE ON ELIZABETH

feeling that something is definitely not rightin fact
something is really really wrong With a panicked
expression she turns around to look behind her

HER POV

Nothing Darkness Jason is gone

ON ELIZABETH

Relaxing -- everythings okay She turns towards the stairs
and right into Jason who raises his machete high

With a SCREAM she leaps backwards as Jason swings flying
through the rotted wood of the railing and crashing down onto
the first floor

ON JASON

yanking his machete from the wooden bolster on the railing
ON ELIZABETH

looking down at her towel Its sliced through -- a thin
line of blood crossing her stomach in a diagonal She runs

EXT DESERTED CABIN - NIGHT

Elizabeth leaps from the porch over an overrun flowerbed
onto the hood of her car She quickly looks behind her

HER POV

to see Jason striding through the front door of the the
cabin coming for her

ON ELIZABETH

as she skids all the way across the hood of the car onto the
far side then runs through the trees and brush in front of
the house -- her feet bare her eyes panicked The branches
seem to claw at her tearing scratching

JASONS POV

quickly gaining God he moves fast Elizabeth turns sees
us and SCREAMS

ON ELIZABETH

turning back to face forward when -- WHACK Shes clipped by
a tree and knocked to the ground She scrambles up and looks
around

HER POV

Jason is nowhere to be seen

Elizabeth moves slowly now turning around her breathing
quick and panicked Where is he Is he toying with her

She turns and Jason leaps in front of her machete raised

Suddenly Elizabeth reaches into the cleavage at the front of
her towel and pulls out a small pistol

ELIZABETH
Eat me you bastard

She fires one shot directly into Jasons forehead knocking
him back at step then turns and bolts towards --
EXT CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT

She runs into this clearing then turns to see Jason rapidly
coming after her striding out into the open raising his
machete ready to deliver the lethal blow when suddenly

INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHTS SNAP ON AROUND THE CLEARING

stunning Jason for a moment The girl disappears into the
treeline as

THE DEAFENING ROAR OF GUNFIRE

cracks out from the darkness There are FBI AGENTS hidden
behind every tree bush and rockand now they are all
firing on Jason at once

Jason jerks as the bullets tear into his body

Then there is a momentthe FBI agents watchingwaiting
for Jason to fall

But he doesnt fall He stands there His head turning
slowly searching the darkness for his next kill Suddenly

from out of the darkness we hear

FBI AGENT ABERNATHY
Incoming

We hear a muffled SHOOMP sound then a familiar WHISTLING as
a mortar shell descends on Jason in the middle of the
clearing

The grenade lands right at Jasons feet

An anxious beatthen

THE MORTAR EXPLODES

We watch as Jason is blown irrevocably limb from limb
ON VARIOUS CHUNKS OF JASON

spinning slowly in the air in SLO-MO An arm something
unrecognizable his head still in the hockey mask then
finally

ON JASONS BLACK HEART

spinning through the air to finally land with a WET PLOP on
the field It beats once then once morethen stops

A moment of silencethen the rest of the FBI agents emerge
from their hiding places There is an eerie after-the-battle
silence to the scene Jasons crimes have been so heinous
that even in death proximity to his mangled remains seems to
render a somber atmosphere

AGENT ABERNATHY makes his way through his quiet somehow
stunned men and over to Elizabeth He is clearly the man in
up

charge -- his suit alone says that and his demeanor backs it

Elizabeth stands and faces him It is a strange tableauthe
bright lights the smoke in the air the nearly naked woman
facing the man in the suit

Agent Abernathy offers his hand

ABERNATHY
Good job Agent Marcus

ELIZABETH
(shaking his hand)
Thank you sir

A TV Camera is thrust into Abernathys face The MEDIA has
apparently caught wind of this event REPORTERS scream for
Agent Abernathyyour comments What was your first
thought when Abernathy smiles and puts on his best
media face

ABERNATHY
Ladies and Gentlemen please
please
The CROWD QUIETS
ABERNATHY
(continuing)

It is my pleasure to announce that
Jason Voorhees is finally and
irrevocablydead

ANGLE ON A LONE MAN

sitting some distance away on the rise of a hill His
weathered face shows a healthy contempt for this somewhat
premature celebration He plugs a twisty homegrown cigar
into the corner of his mouth light a match off the beard
stubble on his chin then fires up the cigar -- a glowing
coal in the darkness His hawks eyes stare at something
with ferocious intent

ON JASONS HEART

Laying on the ground in the clearing not beatingbut
intact

MATCH CUT TO

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
Where we see the heart on a rolling metal surgical table

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A CORONER a big man in his 30s as he rolls the cart up to
a security checkpoint manned by TWO FBI AGENTS The coroner
hands his ID to FBI AGENT 1 then lifts his arms as FBI
AGENT 2 pats him down

FBI AGENT 1
Okay sir

The two sliding doors in front of the coroner slide open and
he wheels the metal surgical cart inside the door closing
behind him

INT FBI MORGUE - DAY

The Coroner is in the middle of his autopsy He talks into
a microphone as he works taking the dismembered parts of
Jason from a body bag

CORONER
We have a large male caucasianage
unknown

He begins inspecting various organs weighs them takes
samples He works methodically making verbal notes as he
works

CORONER
(continuing)
No indication of cirrhosis
ON JASONS VILE BLACK HEART
as the coroner inspects it
CORONER
The heart is nearly twice the size of
a normal heart Malformed
Hes about to lift the heart whenthe heart beats
The coroner stops He didnt see that
CORONER
(trying to keep his
composure)
It appears to be filled with a black
viscous fluidfrankly I dont know
what the hell it is Its not blood
The heart beats again

The coroner stares shocked transfixed

The heart undulates now as it beatsit is a hypnotic
throbbing pulse Something that has to be stared at

Something that awakens deep impossible cravings

It draws the coroner towards it his eyes glassy transfixed
by what he sees

It beats faster undulating a gaping kneading maw

The coroner stares then reaches down and takes the now
furiously beating heart in his hands

He looks at it for a frighteningly long beat He brings it
closer to his face He would appear to be studying it

trying to understand what in Gods name this thing is

And then he suddenly smiles raises the monstrous organ to
his lips

and eats the heart of Jason Voorhees
When he finishes the heart he stands for a moment not
moving Then suddenly his throat bulges and he begins to

SCREAM A HORRIBLE SCREAM and as he SCREAMS we

CUT TO

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT

Dead silence Whatever is going on in that room cannot be
heard through the airtight doors

The CORONERS ASSISTANT walks up carrying dinner The two
FBI MEN stop him

FBI MAN 1
ASSISTANT
You just saw me come out of there

FBI MAN 1
ID please

Annoyed fumbling the assistant takes out his ID

INT FBI MORGUE - NIGHT
The assistant walks in to see the Coroner doubled over

ASSISTANT
Hey whats the matter

The Coroner straightens then turns to the assistant His
mouth is smeared with black liquid of the heart

ASSISTANT

(continuing)
You ate already I was only gone ten
minutes

The assistant tosses the food on the counter as the Coroner
takes

A SHARP DISSECTING PROBE
from off the table and walks over to him

The Coroner holds the dissecting probe up to the Assistants
face

ASSISTANT
(continuing)
Yes Thats a probe

Suddenly using his other hand the Coroner
SHOVES HIS INDEX FINGER
up through the soft flesh under the Assistants jaw hooking
his finger through the Assistants mouth and jerking the
assistants head down to
SMASH INTO THE METAL EXAMINING TABLE
Then the Coroner takes the dissecting probe and drives it
into the back of the Assistants skull The Assistant
spasmsthen goes still
The Coroner turns and walks to the door passing by a mirror

ON THE MIRROR

to see the reflection It is not the coroner walking
byits

JASON VOORHEES HOCKEY MASK IN PLACE

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT

The CoronerJason strides out of the doors and walks past the
FBI men

FBI MAN 1
So thats the verdict -- is Jason

around any time soon

The CoronerJason stops and slowly turns back to the two
smiling FBI men -- there will be doom here very soon

the bounty hunter responsible for the
capture of six of this countrys most
reviled serial killers

SHOT WIDENS

to include Duke playing idly with a small dagger

We recognize him as the man who we saw watching Jason die
Its difficult to say how old he is -- its his life that has
weathered him not his years

CAMPBELL
Mr Duke how can you claim that
Jason Voorhees is not truly dead

DUKE
How many times has Jason been
reported killed before Mr Campbell

CAMPBELL
Eight times

then cremated the body

the darkness and crush their little
skulls -- maybe even your skull Mr
Campbell

Campbell laughs and smiles winningly

Jason Voorhees for ya Ill do it
but it wont be easyand it wont
be cheap One hundred grand non-

Skin stretcher was human

Campbell takes a moment to make sure that isnt lost on his
audience Duke leans in close

DUKE

POV RUSHES AT HIM
as we --
CUT TO

BLACK then slowly

FADE UP ON

INT VOORHEES HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON JOSH

Strapped on a metal table Straps across his body Even a
strap to hold his head firmly in place FIRELIGHT dances
across his apparently nude body and his terror-stricken eyes
His terror grows as a shadow leans in to cover his face

ON THE CORONERJOSH

As he looks down at Josh It is the coroner we see but his
eyes are those black empty pools of Jasons evil Many large
sores cover the mans face

Even as we watch another seems to push its way forth from
the skin Clearly they weaken the man He sways slightly
Catches his balance and raises something into view A
STRANGER RAZOR

ON JOSH

As he begins to whimper The man lowers the razor towards
his face The blade glints in the firelight as the

CoronerJason brings it down closer closer until its
sharp edge touches Joshs skin Then suddenly

The man begins to give Josh a shave

The SCRAPE of the razor is loud against Joshs unlathered
moustache

Now the cornonerJason moves the blade across Joshs Adams
apple carefully expertly

When the man is finished there is a long uncertain beat
then his hands bring a hot towel into view

JOSHS POV

As the towel is laid over his face

BLACKNESS

Over which we hear the STRANGLED SOUNDS of the CoronerJason
breathing -- what the hell is he doing After a long moment
the towel is lifted and still in

JOSHS POV

We see the coronerJason lean in opening his mouth wide
until his face fills the screen

A beat then Josh SCREAMS a horrible SCREAM as we

CUT TO

EXT VOORHEES HOUSE - NIGHT

There is a dark and evil aura to the house but it is not the
Victorian haunted house of some storybook tale of ghosts This
a place built as a summer home in the forties abandoned many
years ago it looks now as if it is dissolving slowly back
into the small encroaching corner of the lake behind it and
into the woods around it

But the sense of evil doesnt come from the rot or the
decay those are just symptoms

The sense of evil comes from the core of darkness that we can
feel in every gaping window In every shadow In the dark
shadows of the trees and the darker waters of the lake

As Josh continues to SCREAM we

FADE TO BLACK

INT DINER - NIGHT
Steven and Randy sit by the counter
and we can see Ward back in the kitchen

A beat

STEVEN
(to Vicki)

prank call

for a box of Lincoln Logs

Suddenly a wet sponge comes flying in from offscreen and
hits Ward in the face

JOEY B (0S)

cook those burgers

WARD

ON STEVEN
As he gets up and walks over to the pay phone in the diner

RANDY

STEVEN

With startling speed Steven pops off the cuff on his wrist
hangs up then turns to Randy waving his free wrist

STEVEN

RANDY

STEVEN
(Steven smiles)

He runs past Randy to the door of the diner then stops and
turns to him

STEVEN
By the way if youd been paying
attention youd have noticed I held
the receiver down when I dialed --
cop like you should be more observant
than that

And he rushes out of the diner

RANDY
He drives me so fucking crazy

CUT TO

INT DIANAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the darkness the phone RINGS A key turns in the door as
Diana enters She finds the light switch as the phone RINGS
again

The lights come on and she dashes across the room to answer
the phone

DIANA
Coming Hold on

She snatches the phone

DIANA
Hello

SHERIFF
(from the phone)
June the 19th

Diana thinks a second trying to place the callerthen
suddenly smiles

DIANA
Ed

Behind Diana a shadowy figure appears in the doorway We
see him as he moves forward but Diana doesnt

INT LANDIS SQUAD CAR - NIGHT
Hes in his car talking on the phone

SHERIFF
Thats when my vacation starts If
we get married then well have two
weeks in Hawaii
(a beat)
I love you Diana Im sorry Ive
waited this long Lets do it

INT DIANAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Diana is as happy as shes ever been The man (who we now
recognize as Josh) is still approaching from the shadows

DIANA
God Ed I love you too I

Now directly behind Diana Josh snakes a hand out snatches
the receiver from her then slams it back into its cradle
Diana only ha time for a STARTLED GASP as Josh grabs her He
takes her head in a firm embrace and draws her face close to
his

DIANA
Josh What are you doing

His lips draw closer and closer to hers His eyes are cold
empty places

She turns her head to the side away from Josh Her eyes
open in a terror born of absolute disbelief and a certain
knowledge that except for the pain she is already dead

DIANAS POV

On the mirror over the mantle In the reflection she sees
not Josh but Jason Voorhees mask in place

DIANA
Oh GodOh Jesus

ON JOSHJASON

As he reaches out to Diana turns her head back to his and
opens his mouth -- its dank and vile and theres something
in there something that writhes horribly the same oozing

color as Jasons dark heart

As the thing squirms out from between his teeth and towards
Dianas lips she manages to screams last

DIANA
No

Panicked determined she reaches down and opens the drawer
of the phone table

Inside is a service revolver

The phone begins to RING AGAIN as Diana grabs the gun and
sticks it against Joshs temple as the black thing in his
mouth begins to pry her lips apart trying to worm inside
She pulls the trigger

The SHOT RINGS LOUD in the room JoshJason staggers back
falls to his knees Hes been shot in the back of the head at

close range -- its a wound that would kill anyone human

The phone CONTINUES TO RING until it is knocked off its
cradle by Diana as she turns and runs to the patio door

Its locked

a

e fiddles with it trying to open it then glances back to

make sure JoshJason isnt coming for her
JoshJason isnt there
Oh shit She back against a wall looking around -- where

s he She turns Hes not there She spots the phone and
moves towards it

Be

Then from the darkness of the shadows

doshJason leaps out at her grabs her and flings her down
to the floor

The injured but very obviously alive JoshJason holds
Dianas head firmly against the carpet He lowers his mouth
towards hers and once again that black thing in his mouth
squirms through his lips The phone keeps RINGING and
RINGING

Suddenly the room is bathed in light as a car pulls up
outside

INT DIANAS HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Steven enters He sees blood and hearing Diana SCREAM
rushes into

INT DIANAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

and leaps on Josh his momentum knocking the man off Diana
before Josh can force the horrible squirming thing from his
mouth into hers -- but the advantage is just momentary

JoshJason turns to Steven and grabs him by his shirt
picking him up off the ground with what is clearly superhuman
strength and throws him against the nearest wall

Steven hits the wall with a sharp nearly back-breaking
impact He lies for a moment stunned near unconsciousness
then he regains his bearings just in time to see JoshJason
taking a knife sharpening pole from the knife rack next to
him in the kitchen

Then JoshJason turns and flings the instrument through the
air at Steven just as Diana runs up to see if Stevens okay

The pole pierces Diana through the back

a

e looks up at Steven with a stunned expression and then
inks down to the floor revealing JoshJason behind her

io

There is a fury in him now that is terrible to behold An
unearthly SCREAM of frustration and rage tears from his
throat His hands reach out ready to tear into Steven

Steven manages to duck roll and come up beside the fireplace
JoshJason turns and charges at Steven

Steven grabs a fireplace poker and rams it with all of his
strength through JoshJasons chest

As he does this he is positioned so that he cant help but
see the reflection in the mirror He sees Jason Voorhees

struggling furiously trying to pull the poker out of his
chest In trying to do that JoshJason is thrown backward

He crashes through a window and falls outside

Steven rushes back to Diana He bends taking her in his
arms

DIANA
(weakly)
You saw him You know who he is

Steven nods
DIANA
(continuing)
You have tosaveJessica Save

Jessica and save the

STEVEN

DIANA
Save your

But the pain is too much

DIANA
(continuing)
Steven
STEVEN

DIANA

Im scared Im very scared
All Steven can do is hold her Her eyes close She dies

SHERIFF (0S)
Oh God Almighty no

ON SHERIFF
Standing there staring in shock He pulls his gun

As he does this Steven sets Diana down and runs towards the
window

STEVEN
It was Josh He fell outside He --

Steven looks out the window

STEVENS POV

There is nothing there but darkness JoshJason is gone
ON STEVEN

As he turns back to SHERIFF The man kneels by Diana

SHERIFF
Oh my dear God

STEVEN
(really to himself)
He was dead He had to be dead
SHERIFF looks up at Steven

The boy stands covered in blood Suddenly he realizes what
this must look like

STEVEN
No you cant think I

But SHERIFFs eyes grow cold

SHERIFF
Lets go

CUT TO

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Steven is in this dismal interrogation room Hes tired
frightened angry We dont know how long hes been here

friend Randy are in the room with him

STEVEN

SHERIFF

into the night

STEVEN

STEVEN
She asked me to come over She said

SHERIFF
Thats a lie Diana would never talk
to you about Jessica Not after what
you did to her

STEVEN

SHERIFF suddenly hauls off WHACKS STEVEN ACROSS THE FACE
then grabs him by the collar and pulls him close

SHERIFF
(continuing)
You call what you did bad You
knocked her up and then left her

STEVEN
No -- she left me After her
miscarriage I --

SHERIFF
-- Miscarriage Who the fuck told

SHERIFF
My Godyou are one sorry son-of-a-
bitch

STEVEN

(a little frantic)
She did have a miscarriage didnt
she Didnt she

SHERIFF
Oh you stupid sorry son-of-a-
bitch

Defeated eyes filled with loss and anger SHERIFF turns and
walks away Then just before he exits he turns back

SHERIFF

(continuing)
If I wasnt the Sheriff here if I
thought I could get away with it
I would kill you right now Thats
no exaggeration

(to Randy)
Ill be back

The Sheriff leaves

Steven watches him go then turns to Randy who cant quite
bring himself to meet Stevens steady gaze

STEVEN
Do you believe me

Randy has to think about this Finally

RANDY
I dont believe that you murdered
Diana I dont know what really
happened but I know you couldnt
have done it

Steven nods -- thats going to have to be enough for now
RANDY
(continuing)
You just sit tight -- Im gonna take

Steven SIGHS then closes his eyes and rubs them

STEVEN
