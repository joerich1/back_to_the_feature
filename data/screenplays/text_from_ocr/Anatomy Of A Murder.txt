EXT OPEN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A dusty four-year-old car speeds along in the shadows of overhanging
trees moonlight splashing through to the pavement

INT MOVING CAR - NIGHT

The driver is PAUL BIEGLER His fingers tap time against the
steering wheel to MUSIC from the radio In the glow from the
dashboard we see a pleasant looking man in his early forties -- wry
humorous mouth lean jaws friendly eyes He wears an old hunting
jacket shirt open at the throat Several angling lures are hooked
into the felt of his battered hat

EXT OPEN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The car approaches PAN it by as it hurries toward the distant lights
of a small town On the shoulder of the road a modest spotlighted
sign reads

THE C OF C WELCOMES YOU TO
IRON CITY MICH
WERE A LIVELY TOWN
EXT MAIN STREET OF IRON CITY - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

The sidewalks are rolled up A single auto is parked in front of a
bar identified by a blue neon sign -- TRIPOLI BAR A traffic light

at an intersection futilely changes color -- kept company only by a

lonesome night marshal standing on the corner From down the
street comes Pauls car

a DOOR OF TRIPOLE BAR NIGHT

The white-aproned BARTENDER leans against the door jamb watching
the-approaching car Inside the bar a man and woman are hunched
over a table -- and at the bar standsa solitary drinker - an elderly
man hat cocked on the back of his head interest absorbed by a bottle
on the bar This is PARNELL Pauls car rolls past the bar Paul
waves calls out Hi Toivo The bartender answers Paul with a
wave

TOIVO
over his shoulder)
Hey Mr McCarthy your pal just
drove into town
INT TRIPOLI BAR NIGHT

Toivo turns from the door comes behind the bar Parnell pours
himself another drink from the bottle on the bar

PARNELL
Just one more Toivo

Parnell is an erect not quite drunk gentleman in his sixties His hat

was once an expensive velvet Homburg His jacket is good tweed but

worn and baggy He wears a Tattersall vest of brilliant colors which
seems wonderfully right on Parnell -- a reflection of a young heart
and love of life As Parnell tosses the drink off Toivo watches him
with a gentle compassion Farnell now fumbles in his various pockets
for sorme money

PARNELL
(continues)
Toivo Im afraid Im going to have to
pay my bar bill tomorrow

TOIVO
Youre good with me Mr McCarthy” ee ee

PARNELL
Thank you Toivo

He straightens his old Homburg hat smooths out the Tattersall vest
and heads for the door

PARNELL
(continues)
Good night Toivo

TOIVO
Good night Mr McCarthy
EXT PAULS HOME AND OFFICE - NIGHT
On the main street -- the lights of the business district in the distance

Pauls car approaches the old two-storied House ‘swings into the
driveway In CLOSE SHOT the headlights catch his shingle fastened

to a support post on the front porch It reads PAUL BIEGLER -

‘ATTY AT LAW The headlights go out Paul climbs from the car

‘bringing with him a collapsed fly rod a knapsack and a trout basket

In the darkness he comes up the steps fumbles into the mail box for —
the door key opens the door flips the light switch inside

INT HALLWAY - PAULS HOME AND OFFICE - NIGHT

Lighted by a shaded bulb hanging from the ceiling the sparsely
furnished foyer an umbrella stand by the door and a limp
artificial potted plant A flight of stairs rises to the second floor

The hallway runs past the stairs to the rear of the house In the

f g a piece of white note paper is speared on one of the points of a
deers antlers which attached to the wall serve as a hat rack

In the b g Paul has entered closed the door behind him with a
practiced kick He comes to the antlers cocks his head sideways
to read the note His lips move a little as he reads

INT PAULS PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

A darkened interior At an angle we look through an open door which
leads into the dark outer office In the outer office another open door
leads into the lighted hallway Paul is seen in the hallway reading
the note on the antlers Not disturbing the note he enters the outer
office passes through into the private office He turns on a standing
lamp Illuminated this office is quite a large room -- was once a
dining room The walls are lined with law books There is a
cluttered roll-top desk and swivel desk chair Grouped about the
desk are several other assorted chairs Against one wall is an
ancient black leather couch and on a small safe in a corner a portable
record player with a well-stocked album rack Near the safe is an old
upright piano against the wall the panel missing revealing its
musical works The round dining table left over from times past

is stacked with law books and legal journals Paul deposits his
fishing gear on the table lifts a brown paper sack from his coat
pocket stands it on the table The sack contains the shape ofa
bottle He opens a closet door and on the inside of the door is fixed
a canvas panel on which are fastened myriad trout lures Paul
removes the lures from his hat hooks them into the canvas The
last is a brightly colored Royal Coachman He affectionately blows
on its pretty feathers before fastening it to the panel Now he tosses
his hat into the closet closes the door gets his trout basket
brushes through a swinging door into the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

- As heenters he lights the room There are no built-in modern
“ea ets-here” This’ kitchen like the rest of the house belongs to

another period There is an antique kitchen cabinet a sink with
wooden drainboar d and brass fixtures a sanded kitchen table and a

kerosene stove of early vintage “Alone in modern splendor is a big

upright freezer Paul takes a half-dozen trout from his basket
plops them on the table He removes his hunting jacket takes a
knife from a drawer sets about cleaning the fish Now he remembers
the note on the antlers Wiping his hands on a towel he goes through
another ‘door in the kitchen which leads into the hallway

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Paul comes from the back of the hallway to the antlers picks ¢ off

‘the note and goes again into the outer office

magazines a half empty bottle of whiskey

INT PAULS PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

He enters from the outer office takes the telephone glances at
the note dials the operator The operator responds her voice

EXT THUNDER BAY TOURIST PARK - NIGHT

On the outside of a small darkened hut a dimly illuminated sign -
reads THUNDER BAY PARK - OFFICE Beyond and scattered
along a narrow road are the shapes of darkened house trailers --
autos parked beside them At the end of the road a wide lake
shimmers in the moonlight In the huta telephone TINKLES faintly

“A light goeson in the hut and through the window we see an elderly

man come from a back room wearing his bathrobe This is Mr
LEMON the park caretaker and deputy sheriff He answers the phone
on the wall -- listens -- replies -- leaves the phone dangling comes
outside the hut -- flashlight in hand -- hurries away to disappear

‘among the trailers

ANOTHER PART OF TOURIST PARK - NIGHT

Lemon comes through trees flashlight beam leading the way
approaching trailer in the fg The trailer has a striped awning

‘over the front door a couple of canvas chairs outside the stoop

Light shines through the broad picture window on the front end of
the trailer The CAMERA LOOKS through the picture window into
the living room of the trailer A folding table is littered with cheap
and several glasses A
e chair andan army officers cap and
e wall A womans negligee hangs

hangs ‘on th back Of

from a corner of an open closet door and on the floor below the

negligee are a pair of blue-puffed bed slippers Beyond the living
room is the passage way which also serves as a kitchen At the end
of the passage way we glimpse an unmade bed The effectis not of
squalor -- but rather of sensual carelessness Mr Lemon has
reached the trailer and we hear him rap on the door several times
Now the door opens and Lemon thrusts his head into the trailer

He calls Mrs Manion Satisfied she is not there he closes the
door

INT PAULS PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Paul with the phone waiting for the call to come through He
glances out the window

EXT PAULS HOUSE - NIGHT

Parnell is crossing the street toward Pauls house He passes
under a street lamp teeters a little on the curb as he steps up

muffled voice brings him to attention

PAUL
(into phene)
Hello -- yes -- well do they know

He hangs up thoughtfully folds the note and puts it in his shirt

pocket returns to the kitchen leaving the door open From the

front of the house comes the sound of a door opening and closing
and Parnell comes from the outer office into Pauls private office

PAUL

and a pitcher of water

PARNELL

PAUL

Paul lights a cigar and returns to his play with the piano keys
Parnell pours himself another drink

PARNELL

Lodwick beat you out of the office

been worth salt for peanuts Not

his community has deserted him --
the finger of scorn is pointed

PAUL
None but the lonely heart shall know
my anguish

17 © PARNELL

PAUL
What the hell are you talking about

John Doe once in a while - or threaten
a few dead beats -- and in the evening
I drink rye whiskey and read law with
Parnell Emmett McCarthy one of
the worlds great men

book from

a shelf)

EXT PAULS HOME - MORNING

Acar same age as Pauls machine rambles to a halt in front of the
house MAIDA - Pauls secretary - has arrived for work Shes
middle-aged seems rather dour but her mouth has a suspiciously
comic twist -- and if she appears to be cynical a closer look at her
eyes will give away her good heart She wears everlastingly a small
flowered hat - the badge of respectability among middle-aged middle
western American women At the stoop she picks up the bottle of

milk and casts about among the bushes for the morning paper --
mumbling as she searches Whered hethrow it this time She cant
find the paper goes on in the house collecting the mail en route

INT OUTER OFFICE - DAY

The outer office seen in daylight is Maidas office Here are
filing cabinets her desk and typewriter and a beat-up sofa for
waiting clients She drops the mail on her desk passes into Pauls
private office

INT PAULS PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

The window shades are drawn -- the lamp still burns Parnell is
stretched out on the couch hat over his face -- a couple of beer
bottles on the floor beside him Maida opens the blinds turns out

looks over his shoulder to see what he is reading

She puts some bread in the toaster

MAIDA

PAUL

T think youd better cancel any
appointments for the day

MAIDA
What appointments People think

Maida opens the big freezer looks inside with disapproval

MAIDA
If that freezer gets many more
fish itll swim up-stream and
spawn -- all by itself

She closes the freezer and goes to stand by the toaster -- waiting — -- -- -
The machine pops a piece of toast into the air She catches it ws
matter-of-factly -- puts it on a plate takes it to the table places

it at Pauls elbow

MAIDA

28 EXT IRON CLIFFS COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND JAIL - DAY

The CAMERA OPENS on Laura Manions small fuzzy dog lying on
the sidewalk PAN up the leash to his mistress LAURA MANION
is dressed in high heels tight ankle length capri pants and a thin
clinging jersey sweater Her hair is smoothly brushed but careless-
Her eyes are still concealed behind dark glasses She is leaning
idly against the fender of her parked car On the lawn about the
three-storied domed Courthouse the usual old men forever found

loitering on the Courthouse lawns are silently watching Laura

CO The sensuous woman is not in the least embarrassed by their open-
mouthed attention Beyond the Courthouse and separated from it by
an alley is the county jail Its barred windows overlook the sidewalk
and street where Laura is waiting Pauls car rolls up nudges into
the curb Paul gets out sees Laura and the audience she has -
gathered After taking it all in for a moment he goes to where she
is waiting ‘

PAUL
I beg your pardon are you
Mrs Manion

Hi
PAUL
Im Paul Biegler

LAURA

Her lips seem to always wear a tremulous childish smile which
could be apologetic or inviting or a secret pleasure at the effect
she has on men and is probably all of these Muff barks at Paul

O

PAUL

She chuckles -- an appealing throaty laugh

INT COUNTY JAIL - DAY

There is a small reception area which contains a desk and a couple of
straightbacked chairs Behind the desk is a barred steel door through
which we can see a flight of iron steps leading upward to the cell
floors Another opening leads to the jailers living quarters and another

opens -- causing a buzzer to SOUND loudly somewhere off in the
jailers quarters -- and Paul and Laura enter SULO the jailer
answering the buzzer hurries into the office Sulo is a stooped slow
moving man with an open good face He speaks with a Finnish accent

PAUL
Hello Sulo
SULO
(happily shaking
Pauls hand)
Hello Polly Its good to see you
Polly I guess youre coming for
the soldier boy

)

16

PAUL
Think that it would be alright if
I talk to him in the Sheriffs office

SULO
Oh shu Polly You go in the
Sheriffs office I bring the
soldier-boy down

PAUL

Sulo unlocks the barred door goes up the stairs as Laura and Paul
go into the Sheriffs office

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAY

A room off the turnkeys station A desk several chairs filing
cabinets a padlocked wall cage in which hang numerous and assorted
guns A bulletin board is on one wall with many federal wanted
circulars One large circular has 10 photographs and is headlined
TEN MOST WANTED MEN Along one side of the room a straight
white line has been painted on the floor running from wall to wall
On one wall at the end of the white line is a chart for testing vision
The barred windows of the room look out into the street and over the
Courthouse lawn Paul and Laura enter

PAUL
Would you mind taking off your
glasses Mrs Manion

A moment - then she takes off the dark glasses The swelling has
gone from the flesh about her eyes but dark bruises remain

PAUL
Barney Quill do that to you
os LAURA
More than that You should see
All over
She smiles -- seems to be waiting for some reaction from Paul

PAUL
Put them back on if its more
comfortable for you

Still smiling she slips the glasses back on -- a curiously
coquettish movement -- as if she were dropping a veil over her
face

C

PAUL
Do you plan to stay for the trial
Mrs Manion

LAURA
Are you serious

PAUL
Well youre a key witness Id
like to know if youll be around

a LAURA

PAUL

husband or against him

LAURA
Why with him -- of course Im

PAUL
The only way I could know was to
ask -

In the reception office the steel door rattles and clangs shut Sulo
enters the Sheriffs office with Lieutenant Frederick Manion Manion
is about 28 with a smooth handsome cold face He is neatly
clothed in tailored US Army Officers fatigues He stands stiffly --
almost Prussian

SULO

unnoticed by Paul

PAUL
Mrs Manion could you meet me
at my office about 2 oclock

LAURA
Of course

Paul opens the door for her Laura rises and hesitates --
then goes to Manion kissing him on the cheek

LAURA
Anything I can get you hon

MANION

Laura smiles at Paul and goes Paul closes the door Almost
immediately Manion moves away wandering about the recom

MANION
(looking at the white
ool) ihe on the floor) o
I could walk it I could walk it
with a quart of red eye in my
belly

Manion fastens his attention on the vision chart He paces away from
the chart to the opposite side of the room reads it glibly swiftly

MANION
P-LU-T-O-D-I L-P-L-O-W-T-R-S-V
KX-Z-AEMU

PAUL
‘One thing we cant claim your
shooting Barney Quill was a case
of mistaken identity

Manion is not amused He moves on to the bulletin board reads the
big circular about the 10 most wanted

PAUL

nothing else)
I want a lawyer ta defend me Mr
Biegler -- not throw me to the wolves

PAUL
Im giving you my first reaction to
what I know about your case

MANION
Youre forgetting that Barney Quill
raped my wife Ive got the unwritten
law on my side

PAUL

(annoyed)
Lieutenant Manion the unwritten law
isa myth There is no such thing as
the unwritten law and anyone who
commits a murder on the theory that
it does exist has just bought himself
bedand board in the State Penitentiary —
- maybe for life ‘With that in mind
perhaps we can proceed with a few
questions and answers which may be
some help to your defense but
probably wont

In the silence the two men measure each other Paul calmly waiting
Manion coldly considering Paul takes out an Italian cigar

PAUL
(continues)
May I borrow your lighter

Manion tosses the gold lighter Paul lights his cigar studies the

lighter

O

homes 2 phony story no

PARNELL
Maybe youre too pure Paul
‘Too pure for the natural
impurities of the law Could be

to find a defense Could also
be you might guide him a little
show him the way and let him
decide if he wants to take it
You want some salt

PAUL
(salting an egg)
Anyway Im not the right lawyer
for this man Hes insolent and
hes hostile

You-dont haveto love him just

32 INT SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAY

Paul is waiting as Sulo ushers Manion in and closes the door Paul
has a wrapped packageunder his arm Manion glances coldly at
Paul passes him and sits at the Sheriffs desk

MANION
(in passing) oe
Hello there rail
PAUL

(with a smile)
I usually answer to the name

of Paul
YS MANION
Are we going to have some more
jokes

PAUL
Not unless you want to be the
comic Oh here Herere some
cigarettes

He extends the wrapped package Manion hesitates a moment
then rather r awkwardly accepts the package

oe “MANION
Thanks

PAUL
Peace

MANION

Sure

PAUL
Lieutenant there are four ways I
can defend murder Number one
it wasnt murder - it was suicide or
accidental Number two you didnt
do it Number three you were
legally justified - like self-defense
or protection of your home Number
four the killing was excusable

MANION
Where do I fit into this rosy picture

PAUL
Il1 tell you where you dont fit You
dont fit in any of the first three

MANION
Why wouldnt I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife

PAUL
The time element If you had caught
him in the act the shooting might have
been justified But you didnt catch
him and you had time to bring in the
police You didn’t do that either
Youre guilty of murder premeditated
and with vengeance First degree
murder in any court of law

MANION
Ave you telling me to plead guilty

PAUL
When I advise you to cop out youll
know it
- Cop out ee
PAUL

Plead guilty and ask for mercy

MANION
If youre not telling me to cop out
what are you telling me to do

PAUL
Im not telling you to do anything
I want you to understand the letter
of the law

(CONT INUED

32 MANION
(a pause)
Go on
PAUL
Go on to what
MANION

To whatever it is youre getting at

PAUL
(with a tough
little grin)
Youre very bright Lieutenant
Now lets see how really bright
you can be

Manion has been impressed and is now a little frightened ‘Tiny
beads of sweat are on his forehead and his upper lip
MANION -
Im working at it

PAUL
Now because your wife was raped
well have a favorable climate in
the courtroom Youll have sympathy
with you -- if all the facts are true
All youll need is a legal peg which
will let the jury hang up their sympathy
in your behalf Do you follow me

Manion nods

PAUL
(continues) ©
Whats your legal excuse Lieutenant
jon your legal éxcuse for killing

“Barney Quill

MANION
Not justification

PAUL
No not justification

MANION
Excuse---just an excuse

Manion hands trembling a little takes out his ivory holder and a
cigarette He becomes annoyed at his shaking hands angrily tosses
the holder and the cigarette on the Sheriffs desk He rises moves
away nervously

MANION
What excuses are there

PAUL
How should I know Youre the one
who plugged Quill

With his thumb Manion wipes the perspiration from his upper lip
Almost unaware of his physical movement he balances on the
white line on the floor walking it carefully as if it were a rail
His jaw is knotted his mind desperately churning his problem
He goes to the window and stares out lips moving a little talking
to himself Paul is leaning against the wall poker-faced eyes
hooded watching Manion

MANION
(whispering)
I mustve been mad
PAUL
What
MANION
I said I was mad
PAUL
A bad temper is no excuse
MANION

Imean -- I mean I mustve been

crazy
(a long pause)

Am I getting warmer

Paul puts on his hat goes to the door and opens it

PAUL -
(calling)
Okay Sulo

MANION

(turning to Paul)
Paul Am I getting warmer

- PAUL
(at the door
Ill tell you that after Ive talked to
your wife In the meantime see if

you were —

I got in and he drove straight to the
trailer park

PAUL
He made overtures

LAURA
No nothing When we got to the
trailer park the auto gate was
closed Mr Lemon always locks
the gate around eleven or a little
after I thanked Barney and started
to get out of the car but he said -
there wasnt any need for me to
walk that he could drive me into
the park on another road I didnt
know there was another road but
he drove on even before I could say
yes or no

PAUL
Were you alarmed

LAURA

No Im not usually afraid of men
And anyway he hadnt touched me
or even said anything out of the
way

PAUL
Dont women sort of instinctively
know when a mans on the make

LAURA

Yes -but thats only usual with me-

LAURA
Call me Laura

PAUL

PAUL
Im not your couturier Laura Im
concerned with facts which might
be of use to me or to the prosecuting
attorney

‘LAURA
Well I dont wear one

PAUL
(gently exasperated)
Please go on with what happened

34 LAURA
Well he turned off the highway into
a lane in the woods and stopped the
car and turned off the lights He
grabbed me and said Im going to
rape you Just like that

PAUL
He used those words

‘LAURA
Exactly those words Muff began to
bark and he threw him out the window
I could hear Muff whining outside the
car all through it Barney began
to try to get at me and I fought him
as best I could He was terribly strong

PAUL
Did you cry out Did you scream

LAURA
It didnt seem any use there in the
woods He began to shout names at
me like army slut and some other
names - and then he drew back and
hit me with his fist He hit me again
and I didnt fight any more I think
I was only half conscious but I know
that he tore my panties off - and did
what he wanted

PAUL
The newspaper said a doctor examined
you and didnt think youd been raped

LAURA
I dont care what the doctor thought
a woman doesnt mistake these things

PAUL’
All right Go ahead

LAURA

(telling it calmly)
I dont know exactly what happened
then I mustve fainted because the
next thing I remember the car was
moving Barney was driving very
fast and he was breathing hard
almost gasping An ugly awful sound

MORE)

34 LAURA (contd)
We were on the main road to the trailer
park and he swung in by the gate and
stopped I opened the door and Muff
jumped out first with the lighted
flashlight in his mouth

PAUL
Wait a minute I thought you said he
had thrown Muff out of the car in the
woods

LAURA
He did But Muff was in the car when
we got to the gate He must have let
Muff back in I dont remember

PAUL
Goon You opened the door and Muff
jumped out first

LAURA
Before I could get out Barney grabbed
me and said he was going to tear all
my clothes off and attack me again
I got away and ran I could see Muff
at an opening in the fence He was
scooting back and forth with the
flashlight Barney caught me from
behind and I fell to the ground He
fell on top of me and started to beat
me again with his fists I thought
he was going to kill me I screamed
and somehow I got on my feet again
and ran toward the fence I went
through the opening in the fence and
followed Muff who was running along
ahead with the flashlight I kept

- following the light and he led me to

“our trailer -

PAUL
You didnt see Barney again

LAURA
I never laid eyes on him again -
dead or alive

PAUL
I guess thats enough for now
Laura ’

LAURA

whole thing in my mind You see I
hadnt done that before -- I was trying
to forget about it But when I tried
remembering it there were some pieces
missing I remember going to the bar
with a gun I remember Quills face
behind the bar -- but I dont seem to
remember anything else not even
going home

PAUL

Dont you remember firing your gun
Five shots are a lot of noise to forget

MANION

T remember hearing-shots but they— —————-

didnt seem to be connected with me --
like they were far away like somebody

else was doing the shooting

Manion mops his face with a handkerchief nervously fits a
cigarette into his holder Paul waits for a moment or two

PAUL

Come on in Polly Come on in

Paul pushes through the office gate and goes into Mitchs private
office The office is quite handsomely decorated with prints of
modern artists new modernistic furniture and vertical venetian
blinds

MITCH

(continues)
You havent been in here since you
vacated have you Polly Dont —
recognize the old place huh My
wife did it for me -- shes a graduate
decorator Smart girl very smart
girl Look at this real genuine Van
Gogh prints - andhere here try
this chair It sort of does things

He pushes Paul into a large contour chair The moment Paul sits
the back drops down the footrest leaps up and the chair begins to
massage Paul endures the operation with slightly alarmed
patience lying helplessly shaking uncomfortably

MITCH
(continues)
Great isnt it Good for the nerves
they say

PAUL
(jiggling)
How do you shut it off
Mitch presses a button The chair stops wiggling snaps Paul
into an-‘upright position the footrest drops and‘his feet hit the -
floor oo

MITCH
There we are Feel better ‘

PAUL
(getting out of the chair)
I feel all shook up Mitch I just
stopped by to tell you Ive got both
feet in the Manion case

MITCH
Youre going to cop out arent you

PAUL
No

MITCH
Thats a mistake Polly its open
and shut

PAUL
Maybe Well see

MITCH
Judge Maitland is still in the hospital
Maybe youd like to agree toa
continuance until he gets back If
we go with the case now well have
to try before some grab-bag judge
theyll send in Me Id rather have
Maitland

PAUL
So would I - but that would also mean
my client would have to lie in jail
for another two or three months before
the trial Now if you drop the charge
down to manslaughter so I can get him
out on bail well agree to a continuance

MITCH
You wouldnt do that if you were D A
You wouldnt drop a charge from life
down to a fifteen year maximum penalty

PAUL
I might since a big fat liedetector
test on his wife gave the truth to the
rape story Hell have the jury with
him

e

MITCH
(into the trap)
How ‘did you kno’

He stops suddenly Paul grins

MITCH
(continues)
Bit didntI Well anyway the
result of a liedetector test isnt
admissable evidence you cant
use it

PAUL
No but it carries moral weight

defense old box tops

PAUL
Ill think of something
(he turns
at the door)
I wouldnt sit in that chair much
Mitch it could shake a mans
brain loose

EXT STREET IN THUNDER BAY - DAY

A winding rambling street on the lake shore -- busy now but in the
winter most of it will be shuttered Thunder Bay is that kind of place
MUSIC blares from the bingo parlor - a sporting store with its
fishing tackle on the sidewalk engages the rapt attention of vacationing
fishermen -- testing rods tinkering with reels Children in bathing
suits run across the street without regard for traffic the traffic
pokes along -- plump matrons in shorts at the hot dog stands -- an
occasional slim blossoming girl in a bathing suit -- men in white
ducks and sun visors « soldiers off duty Most of the movement is
to and from the lake where rowboats drift about in the sun fishermen

cast from the piers and swimmers dive from the floats Pauls car

comes slowly on the street draws up to the curb by a sign which
advertises -- BRIGITTES BEAUTY SHOPPE The car door opens
and Maida steps to the sidewalk

PAUL
Meet me for lunch at Barneys inn
down at the end of the street

ee a
Right

She closes the rear door moves away toward the beauty shop and
enters The front car door opens and Parnell bumbles out

PAUL
Where are you going

PARNELL
Im going to tool around the taverns
in search of truth

PAUL
Maybe youd better stay with me

PARNELL
Trust me lad trust me Ill arrive
at the inn loaded with nothing more
than strawberry pop

He closes the car door adjiists his hat at a rakish angle and strolls
down the street Paul drives away

EXT THUNDER BAY INN - DAY

A large three-story frame structure with a fresh coat of white paint
screenedin verandas its lawn shaded by elderly trees It is a
well-kept relic from the turn of the century when Thunder Bay was a

- more graceful resort Outside the hotel are parked numerous cars

and tourists come and go from the main entrance

”

An unlighted neon-sign identifies THE THUNDER BAY INN
and in smaller script advertises “Breakfast Lunch and Dinner
and in block letters Cocktails The bar room has a separate

entrance and is labeled by an unlighted neon-sign as the BAR

Its door is closed and the windows shuttered with venetian blinds
Paul drives up and finds a parking space near the entrance to the
bar He gets out of the car and scans the front of the hotel before
going to the door of the bar room On the closed door a sign reads
OPEN 5 pm Paul pushes the door finds it unlocked enters

INT THE INN - BAR - DAY

Like all bars concerned with evening business the afternoon
atmosphere is cool pleasant and restful It is darkened except
for back-bar lights and sunlight filtering from around the closed
venetian blinds It is at the moment completely deserted A
bartender has been at work preparing the bar for its evening
business A collection of empty bottles are on one end of the bar
the glassware is covered by white cloths and a can of bar polish
is on the bar with a polishing rag At one end of the bar are a
couple of pinball machines -- near the door Chairs are stacked
on the tables and in the booths Behind the bar one section of
the bar mirror is devoted to a display of gold and silver loving
cups and a collection of enlarged snapshots mainly showing a
broad-chested curly haired man of about fifty Some of the
pictures include other people but always the curly haired man
is prominent holding a prize angling catch -- with a rifle in
his hand and a dead buck on the fender of his car -- with a target
pistol raised and posed -- and several other pictures of the same
man probably made when he was in his twenties wearing boxing

gloves and in fighting pose One of the most recent snapshots

presents the man stripped to the waist posed with a double-bitted -

axe above a neatly severed log Beyond the bar a short flight

of steps leads up to a closed door above which a sign reads
TO LOBBY

Paul upon entering the room from the outside pauses until his
eyes become accustomed to the darkness glanc

‘theplungeronone ofthe pinball machines movesonto the bar

His attention is attracted by the display of photographs arid loving
cups He moves around behind the bar picks up a gold cup

reads its inscription replaces it examines another His attention
goes to the snapshots and he puts on his glasses for a finer study
of the pictures From his POV the CAMERA CLOSES IN and
MOVES from picture to picture Now in turning to come from
behind the bar he notices a narrow shelf built up under one end

of the bar He stoops looks into the shelf finds it empty

- Puzzling with the contraption he tentatively slips his hand into

the narrow space and suddenly withdraws the hand finger and
thumb cocked to represent a pistol He looks down the length of
the bar and sees two more shelves of like character one in the
center by the space reserved for waiters service and the other
at the far end

O

He starts to move along back of the bar toward these other shelves
but the lobby door opens There in the doorway is a small dark
hard-faced man with black inscrutable eyes This is PAQUETTE

have been consulted before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction

Your Honor were dealing with the

Army on this matter and this was the
only crack the Army would give us
at one of their psychiatrists The
Court was not present and it was
urgent that we get the defendant to
the psychiatrist

say to this

MITCH
It was done with my knowledge Your
Honor

JUDGE WEAVER
Ive always heard that this Upper
Peninsula of our fair state was a queer
place If its customary here to allow
ed with first degree murder
4 il I dont suppose
it behooves an outsider to point out
that the law makes no provision for
such quaint liberalism

PAUL
Your Honor the defendant is ina
deputys care and will be returned
this evening Hes an officer in the
United States Army and not likely
to try to run away

Since the defense plea is insanity the
prosecution has retained a psychiatrist
Under the statutes we have a right to
petition for a mental examination of
the defendant by our own doctor Are
you familiar with the statute Mr Biegler

PAUL
Moderately

DANCER

It would delay things to file a formal
petition Why dont we get together
and informally agree to ask his honor
for an adjournment - just for a day
or so and let our doctor visit with
the defendant It will save everybody
time dont you think Mr Biegler

had passed through the heart Death

JUDGE WEAVER
So noted

MITCH
Counsel may cross-examine

PAUL

Dr Raschid your primary purpose
was to ascertain the cause of death
was it not

RASCHID
Yes

PAUL
Yet I see by your report that you
checked to determine whether
spermatogenesis was occurring in
the body of the deceased at the time
of death

MITCH
Objection Your Honor -- the People
have called this witness only to show
cause of death

PAUL
Your Honor the entire report has
been entered as evidence and the
report contains this information
about spermatogenesis

JUDGE WEAVER
Overruled Mr Lodwick Take the
answer

Yes I made that examination on the
deceased ©
PAUL
will you tell the Court your findings
RASCHID
Spermatogenesis was occurring at
the time of death

PAUL
In other words the deceased in life
was not sterile -- he could produce
children Is that correct Doctor

Paul places the unfinished lure between the pages of a single lawbook
on the table before him and perusing the doctors report he rises

cedar antich dtl te nae arn eeetee D

RASCHID
That is correct

PAUL
Now Doctor if a woman says shes
had intercourse with a certain man
and this man is proved fertile yet no
evidence is found in the womans body
couldnt a lawyer--say a prosecuting
attorney--use this as evidence that
the woman is lying

MITCH
Your Honor I object to this line of
questioning Were not concerned
here with whether or not theres been
relations between a man and a woman

- Wasno completion onthe part of the man

PAUL —

‘Since an examination for spermatogenesis

was made certainly were entitled to
know why

JUDGE WEAVER
Objection overruled Take the answer

RASCHID
Yes prosecution could use that--
though certainly it would not be
conclusive that she was lying

PAUL
Why not

-RASCHID
Well there could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative--the use
of a contraceptive or perhaps there

‘PAUL
In this post-mortem were you also
asked to determine whether or not
the deceased had had a sexual climax
shortly before his death

RASCHID
No

PAUL
Could you have made such a determination

RASCHID
Yes

wo Then you were only asked to make such
examination as might be useful to the
prosecution but none which might help
the defense although such evidence might
have existed

RASCHID
Well yes --

is argumentative Counsel for the
defense is trying to impugn the intent

PAUL -
Did you see Mrs Manion

LEMON
Yes sir

PAUL

What was her appearance

LEMON
Well -- she was a mess

MITCH
Objection No evidence has been
introduced to make Mrs Manions
appearance relevant to this case

PAUL
(angry)

No evidence was introduced to make
Barney Quills appearance relevant
but you didnt object to my question
then Is that because you know that
Quill bathed and changed and cooled
off after he had raped and beat the
hell out of this poor woman

MITCH
Your honor everybody in this
courtroom is being tried except
Frederick Manion I must protest
Mr Bieglers attacks on

quiet

JUDGE WEAVER
Mr Biegler youre an experienced

irrelevant immaterial inconclusive --

PAUL
(cutting in)
Thats too much for me The witness
is yours Mr Lodwick

MITCH
(caught in mid-air
by Pauls sudden
switch)
Huh -- oh no questions

JUDGE WEAVER
Witness may step down Call your

man of about forty direct thoughtful honest Mitch takes the
direct examination

il4
80 (i7)

MITCH
State your name and your occupation
please

DURGO

Detective Sergeant James Durgo
Michigan State Police

MITCH
Were you called to Thunder Bay by
Deputy Sherifi Lemon of Thunder
Bay on the night that Barney Quill
was shot and killed

DURGO
Yes sir Iwas My companion
officer and I were the first to be
called in on the case

MITCH
Sergeant Durgo when you arrived at
the Manion trailer who was there

DURGO
Lieutenant Manion and his wife were
there

MITCH

What did Lieutenant Manion say to you

DURGO
He said that his wife had had some
trouble with Barney Quill and that
he had gone to the tavern and shat
Quill He asked us whether Quill
was dead or not and we told him he
was

MITCH cos
How did ‘Lieutenant Manion take
this information

DURGO
He didnt seem surprised

MITCH
What did you do then Sergeant
Durgo

DURGO
I asked for the gun he had used

80 MITCH
Did you take Lieutenant Manion to
the County jail here in Iron City on
that same night

DURGO
Yes sir We drove the Lieutenant
down with his wife

MITCH
On the drive to Iron City did the
Lieutenant talk further about the
shooting

DURGO
He remarked that if he had the whole
thing to do over again he would still
do it He also said that he had thought
about it before going to the bar and
had decided that Quill shouldnt be
allowed to live

MITCH
Through all this - at the trailer --
the drive to Iron City how did
Lieutenant Manion appear to you

DURGO
He was very quiet most of the time
and seemed clear-headed

MITCH
You would say he was calm

DURGO
Yes -- calm

coe MITCH
“As-fatas you could tell would
you say that he was in complete
possession of his faculties

DURGO
He seemed so to me
MITCH
Your witness
PAUL

Now sergeant you testified that
the Lieutenant told you he had shot

Barney Quill after he had learned
that his wife had had ‘some trouble
with Quill Were those the words the
Lieutenant used Some trouble

Cd

Mitch and Dancer confer for a moment

19)

DURGO
No sir Those were my words --
not his

PAUL
Was it your notion to come here and
use your own words

DURGO
No sir it was not

PAUL
Was the suggestion made to you ta
call it some trouble’ by a person
now in this room

DURGO
(looking toward
Mitch)
Yessir it was

PAUL
Now would you please tell the Court
what words Lieutenant Manion
actually used to describe the ‘trouble
his wife had had

MITCH
Objection your honor Weve been
over this before This information
would not be relevant to any issue
before the Court

PAUL
This statement concerning some
trouble was brought out during the
direct examination of Sergeant Durgo

Up tonow the prosecution has adroitly

restricted all of their witnesses
testimonies where Laura Manion has
been concerned But now the cat is
out of the bag and its fair game for
me to chase it

JUDGE WEAVER
This is a sore point Mr Biegler
and its getting sorer Id like ta
hear what the prosecution has to say

Then Mitch rises

MITCH
Your honor the burden is on the
defense to prove temporary insanity
at the time of the shooting If the
reason for the alleged insanity is
important to this case then that is
a matter for a competent witness --
an expert on the subject of the human
mind What the defense is trying to
do is introduce some sensational
material for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues

PAUL
Your henor how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here
unless they first know the reason behind
this whole trial -- why Lieutenant
Manion shot Quill The prosecution
would like to separate the motive from
the act Thats like trying to take
the core from an apple without breaking
the skin Well the core of our defense
is that the defendants temporary insanity
was triggered by this so-called trouble
with Quill I beg the Court to let me
cut into the apple

MITCH
Our objection still stands your honor

The courtroom is silent All attention upon Judge Weaver This
is why he is called judge because alone he must decide what is
just or unjust Judge Weaver in deep study takes out his watch
winds it the SOUND clearly heard in the silent room He looks
at Paul Manion Laura Dancer and Mitch He looks out over the
slack-mouthed thrill seekers among the spectators and from his
POV we too look at all these people Finally the judge leans
back in his chair puts his watch back in his pocket

JUDGE WEAVER
Ill take the answer

A wave of muted excitement travels through the courtraom Faul
gratified and triumphant rises to continue the crossexamination
Mitch rises intending to protest the judges decision but is stayed
by a touch on his arm from Dancer

PAUL
Sergeant Durgo tell the Court how
Lieutenant Manion described the
trouble his wife had with Barney Quill

118
80 - DURGO
He told us that Quill had raped his
wife

PAUL
Can you recall generally what
Lieutenant Manion told you about
this rape

DURGO
Yessir He said hed been asleep
since right after dinner and that he
was waked up by some noise --
screams he thought That he got up
and opened the trailer door and went
outside and his wife came running
out of the dark and fell into his arms

PAUL - —F —
You saw his wife in the trailer How
did she look

DURGO
She was a little hysterical and shed
been pretty badly beaten up She
had big black bruises over her face
co and arms

PAUL
Dia she tell you the story about the
rape and beating

DURGO
She did

PAUL
Did she take you to the place where
it had happened

Se ‘DURGO

Yessir The next morning
PAUL

Did you ‘find anything there -- any

sort of evidence pertaining to what
Mrs Manion had told you

DURGO
On the lane in the woods we found
some tire tracks and some dog tracks
and a glasses case with some horn-
rimmed glasses inside

(MORE)

119
80 C) a DURGO (contd)

N We also looked for a - uh -- a certain
undergarment of Mrs Manions but
we didnt find it

JUDGE WEAVER
Will the attorneys from both sides
approach the bench please

Paul Dancer and Mitch come to the Judges bench The Judge
leans over to look down at them and their conversation is conducted
in a low monotone

JUDGE WEAVER
(continues)

Mr Biegler you finally got your
rape into the case and I think all
the details should be made very
clear to the jury Do you agree
Mr Lodwick

MITCH
Absolutely

JUDGE WEAVER
What exactly was the undergarment
Oo just referred to

PAUL
Panties your honor

JUDGE WEAVER
Do you expect this subject to come
up again

PAUL
vee sir

ae a JUDGE WEAVER ooo

Theres s a certain light connotation —
attached to the word ‘panties

Can we find another name for them

MITCH
I néver heard my wife call em
anything else

JUDGE WEAVER
Mr Biegler

PAUL
Im a bachelor your honor

e

80 JUDGE WEAVER
Thats a great help Mr Dancer

DANCER
When I was overseas during the war
Your Henor I learned a French word
but it might be slightly suggestive

JUDGE WEAVER
Most French words are All right
go back to your places

The attorneys return to their tables

JUDGE WEAVER
(continues)
For the benefit of the jury but more
especially for the spectators the

-undergarment referred to in the
testimony was to be exact Mrs
Manions panties

A snicker goes through the room Judge Weaver waits for quiet
again
JUDGE WEAVER
(continues)
I wanted you to get your snickering
over and done with This pair of
panties will be mentioned again in
the course of the trial and when that
happens there will not be one laugh
one snicker one giggle or even one
smirk in my courtroom There isnt
anything comic about a pair of panties
which figure in the violent death of
one man and in the possible incarceration
of another

Along ‘pause ‘a pin drop can ‘be heard
JUDGE WEAVER

(continues)
Proceed Mr Biegler

PAUL
Sergeant did you further investigate
Mrs Manions story

DURGO
Yessir I asked a lot of questions --
like did anyone hear the screams from
up by the gate that night We found
some people in the tourist park who
had heard the screams

80 PAUL
Go ahead What else did you do in
your investigation

DURGO
Imade Mrs Manion tell her story
several times

PAUL
I suppose you were looking for
variance in her story

DURGO
Yessir but there wasnt any

PAUL
Did you give Mrs Manion a lie-
detector test

MITCH
Objection A polygraph test is
inadmissible evidence in our courts

PAUL
Tonly asked if he gave a test
I didnt ask the results

JUDGE WEAVER
Take the answer

DURGO
I gave her a lie-detector test at
her request

PAUL
Now after all this investigation
did you believe Mrs Manion

DURGO
I-did 7 Z
PAUL
Even after the lie-detector test
DURGO
Yessir
MITCH

Your honor I object to that question
and answer It constitutes flagrant
sneaking subterfuge on the part of
the defense counsel

121

JUDGE WEAVER
Objection sustained Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury a polygraph
or lie-detector test is not admigsible
evidence because no one has ever been
sure but what some people can lie
even to a lie-detector and get away
with it Go ahead with your field day
Mr Biegler

PAUL
a half-grin)
Thank you Your Honor But in any
case Sergeant Durgo you yourself
in your heart and mind were quite
convinced of Mrs Manions honesty

DURGO
Yessir
PAUL
Thats all

MITCH

Just a moment

He and Dancer are conferring -- Mitch nodding to what Dancer is
saying Mitch rises ‘

MITCH
(coritinues)
Sergeant Durgo did you look for the
panties elsewhere than the lane in
the woods

DURGO
We looked in Barney Quills car and
his room in the hotel We couldnt
find the panties

MITCH
Do you know why Mrs Manion
requested a liedetector test

DURGO
I know what she said

MITCH
What was that

DURGO
She said she wanted everybody to
believe her story because she knew
it would help her husband

MITCH
That was the only reason she gave

DURGO
I dont remember anything else
She said she had already sworn to

123

her husband and she wanted everybody

else to believe it too

Dancer is riveted Pauls face is tight Lauras lips are open

tremulous

Maida compulsively closes her eyes

and whispers to Mitch

MITCH

Dancer rises

Sergeant Durgo did Mrs Manion tell
you how she had sworn to her husband

DURGO

Yessir She said she had sworn on

rosary

MITCH
A moment your honor
(he again confers with
Dancer and returns to
the witness)
Sergeant this lane in the woods --
what is it used for -- where does
it g0

DURGO
It used to be a logging road --
doesnt go any place -- it just stops

MITCH
Who uses it now

DURGO
I think its a road that kids drive
‘down to park oe

MITCH
You mean its a lovers lane

DURGO
I think so yes sir

MITCH
The witness is yours Mr Biegler

PAUL
No questions

CONT INUED)

124

JUDGE
Witness may step down

Paul glances at Dancer Dancer smiles and nods as if to say
Yes Ive caught on

MITCH
In view of the evidence concerning
rape which your honor has ruled
admissible the prosecution asks
for a thirty minute recess in order
to bring in another witness whom we
had not anticipated using

JUDGE WEAVER
Can you get the witness in that length
of time

MITCH
Yes sir

JUDGE WEAVER we
Very well The Court is recessed for
thirty minutes

In the general hubbub of recess Paul turns to Laura and Manion

PAUL

DISSOLVE TO

81 INT COURTROOM - DAY

DR DOMPIERRE is on the stand A pleasant faced bespectacled
baldheaded little doctor Dancer is examining

the fifteenth of this year

DOMPIERRE
I did

DANCER
Who called you to the jail

DOMPIERRE
The police authorities

DANCER
What did they want you to do

DOMPIERRE -

They wanted “meto make a test for
the presence of sperm on the person
ofa Mrs Frederick Manion I made

the test

DANCER
In making this test what was your
conclusion

DOMPIERRE

Negative There was none

DANCER
Your witness Mr Biegler

PAUL
O Doctor in making your test did you
notice any bruises or marks on
Mrs Manion at that time

DOMPIERRE
I did
PAUL

Were you asked to determine the
reason for these bruises

DOMPIERRE
I was not

PAUL
Where did you do the laboratory work
on the test for sperm

DOMPIERRE
ce Saint Margarets Hospital in this
“ety -
PAUL
Who worked the slides up for you
DOMPIERRE
a) A technician at the hospital
PAUL

What kind of a technician

DOMPIERRE
Oh X-Ray -- like that

PAUL
Was he a pathologist or an expert
in laboratory work having to do with
human reproduction

DOMPIERRE
He was just a technician

PAUL
Wouldnt it have been better to
have these‘slides worked up by a
pathologist or an expert in this
field

DOMPIERRE
Yes but the police were in a hurry
and I knew this young fellow came on
e at seven in the morning

81 PAUL
Wouldnt it have been especially better
to wait for an expert if the possible
question of rape hung on the result

DOMPIERRE
It would have been

PAUL
Now Doctor in the newspaper on the
evening of August sixteen it was stated
that you had found no evidence of rape
Is that true

DOMPIERRE
It is not true I made no such statement

PAUL
Did you form an opinion about whether
Mrs Manion had been raped

DOMPIERRE
No sir

PAUL
Why didnt you form ar opinion

DOMPIERRE
Its impossible to tell if a mature
married woman has been raped

PAUL
No further questions

DANCER
Doctor did you have an opinion about
whether or not she had any recent
relations with a man

co DOMPIERRE
“Yes Oo
DANCER
State your opinion

DOMPIERRE
Insofar as no sperm was present it
didnt appear that she had had recent
relations with a man

DANCER
Thats all

One more question Doctor That no
evidence was present in her body does
not mean she wasnt raped does it

DOMPIERRE
No

PAUL
Do you know what constitutes rape under
the law

DOMPIERRE

Yes sir Violation is sufficient for
rape There need not be a completion

PAUL
No more questions

JUDGE WEAVER
Witness may step down

DANCER
The People recall Alphonse Paquette
to the stand

Paquette comes forward

JUDGE WEAVER
Youre still under oath Mr Paquette

Paquette goes to the witness box

DANCER
Your Honor since counsel for the
defense has forced the question of
rape it becomes necessary to take
this additional te stimony from Mr
Paquette
nit (to Paquette)”
Mr Paquette will you take a look
at Mrs Manion sitting there at
the defense table Was she dressed
in this manner on the night of the
shooting

PAQUETTE
No

DANCER
How was she dressed that night

PAQUETTE
I recollect she had on a real tight
skirt and a sweater-kind- of-thing
sort of glued on She was wearing a
pair of red shoes with high heels

DANCER
Was she wearing hose

PAQUETTE
No she was bare-legged

DANCER
Was she wearing a hat

PAQUETTE
No

Three women on the jury three nice respectable matrons- have——
gotten a pinched look about their faces

DANCER
Mr Paquette what kind of hair does
Mrs Manion have under that hat

PAUL
Well be glad to show the Court Mrs
Manions hair Mrs Manion will
you take off your hat please

Laura jerks her hat off pulls a couple of hairpins and disdainfully
shakes out her glamorous tresses

DANCER
Thank you Counselor Mr Paquette
was she wearing glasses that night

PAQUETTE
I think she ‘was when she ® Blayad
‘pinball
DANCER

Considering the tight skirt and the
tight sweater and the bare legs what
was the result in her appearance

PAQUETTE
Well

DANCER
Would you say Mrs Manions appearance
on that night was deliberately voluptuous
and enticing

81 PAQUETTE
Well you could pretty much see
everything she had

PAUL
Your Honor defense will concede
that Mrs Manion when dressed
informally is an astonishingly
beautiful woman As a matter of
fact its pretty easy to understand
why her husband became temporarily

‘deranged when he saw such beauty

bruised and torn by a beast

Judge Weaver blows his nose to keep from laughing

DANCER
Your Honor I protest Mr Biegler
is perhaps the least disciplined and
the most completely out-of-order
attorney Ive ever seen in a courtroom

A laugh goes through the courtroom

JUDGE WEAVER

(rapping)
Jury will ignore Mr Biegiers oration

DANCER
Was Mrs Manion drinking heavily
that night

PAQUETTE

Well I sold her six drinks myself
and Barney came over and got some
more for her I dont remember
how many

DANCER

“Would you say ‘that Mrs Manion v was

tight

PAQUETTE
She was high all right

DANCER
What did she do to make you think
she was high

131
81 a PAQUETTE

NY She took off her shoes and went
barefooted and when she played
pinball she would kind of swish
around to give the machine english —

DANCER
You mean she was flipping her hips
around

PAQUETTE
Yes

DANCER
Anything else

PAQUETTE
When shed made a good score she

— ‘squeaied-—---

like women do

DANCER

She waa playing pinball with Barney
Quill wasnt she

PAQUETTE
7) Yes sir
DANCER
What was her attitude toward Barney
Quill
‘ PAQUETTE
Friendly I guess you could call it -
‘ DANCER
More than friendly perhaps
o PAQUETTE
-Ithought so oe so
DANCER

Why did you think so

PAQUETTE
She would kind of lean on him and
a couple of times she bumped him
with her hip

At the defense table Manion is pale and strained Laura holds
her lip between her teeth

e

132

DANCER
Would you say Mrs Manion was
making a play for Barney Quill
PAUL
Objection That calls for an

assumption on the part of the
witness your honor

DANCER
I withdraw the question Would you
say that Mrs Manion was free and
easy with Barney Quill

PAQUETTE
I would
DANCER
Your witness Mr Biegler
PAUL
(rising)

Mr Paquette the attorney for the
People asked you if Mrs Manion
was tight and you said she was high
Speaking as a bartender what is
the distinction between the two

PAQUETTE
I dont think I understand

PAUL
When we say a person is tight we
usually mean theyre a little stupid

with drink isnt that right

PAQUETTE
I guess thats about it yes

“PAUL
But if theyre high theyre gay and
enjoying themselves ©

PAQUETTE
Yes

PAUL

- Soin other words Mrs Manion

was happy Now is there anything
wrong with being happy in the
Thunder Bay Inn

PAQUETTE
No

81 PAUL
Thunder Bay itself is a resort isnt
it Swimming fishing that sort
of thing

PAQUETTE
Yes

PAUL
Is it unusual to see a bare-footed
woman in Thunder Bay -

PAQUETTE
No

PAUL
So Mrs Manion taking off her shoes
in Thunder Bay doesnt necessarily
mean that she was being unladylike

does it

PAQUETTE
I guess not

PAUL
Yes or no

PAQUETTE
No

PAUL

You testified that Mrs Manion was
squealing jumping up and down and
swishing her hips at the pinball
machine Was she creating a
disturbance was she attracting

a crowd

‘PAQUETTE
Noy oo
PAUL

Were all of the men in the bar
standing around watching Mrs Manion

PAQUETTE
No

PAUL
But you were conscious of Mrs Manion
enough so that you can tell us how she
acted

PAQUETTE
Yes
PAUL
And certainly Barney Quill was
conscious of Mrs Manion because
he was playing pinball with her
Wouldnt you say so

PAQUETTE
Yes

PAUL

So it seems that only you and Barney

Quill were acutely aware of Mrs
Manion and her actions and appearance
Perhaps Barney when he came to

get some drinks perhaps he winked

and said ‘Alphonse Im going to

take this babe out and rape her - oe

PAQUETTE
(angry)
No no he didnt

PAUL
(boring in raising
his voice
And maybe you said Do it once for
me

The courtroom is rumbling

DANCER
(shouting --
simultaneously
with Paul)
Objection objection Those arent

-- questions Counsel is attacking the

witness
PAUL

(contemptuously)
No more questions

JUDGE WEAVER
(restoring order)
The Court has had about all of this

‘dogfight it can take for one day And

Im sure the jury is immensely
confused tired and hungry

135

MITCH
Your Honor that was the last of the
Peoples witnesses
JUDGE WEAVER
Very well Mr Lodwick Tomorrow
the defense will take over and with
expedition prayer and a little self-
discipline on part of counsel perhaps
we can reach an end by Saturday night
The Court stands adjourned until
nine tomorrow morning

Im just a lawyer doing my job What
are you so afraid of Al

Paul turns Mary Pilant dressed in skirt and a coat-sweater has
just entered the bar from the lobby Her face is pale and concerned
She approaches Paul waits for him to speak

Could we have some privacy

Silently she leads the way to the far table by thé window and the door

I owe you an apology Miss Pilant
I was a little rough when I was here

your father

MARY
How did you find that out

C) Friend of mine did a bit of what Al
there would call snooping Oh could

Ibuy you a drink

MARY
Its a long drive from Iron City in thig
kind of a night Mr Biegler

PAUL
You mean why am I here

MARY
You didnt come just to apologize

PAUL
No no but the apology was part of
it Tell you the truth I thought it
might thaw you out just a little Now
all I want you to do Miss Pilant is
listen for just a few minutes I need
some strong evidence to back up Laura
Manions story about the rape The
prosecution is going to attack that story
pretty hard - and if the jury thinks shes
lying it could turn their decision against
Manion

MARY
Well isnt she lying Barney didnt
do what she said he did He couldnt
have

PAUL
What did you know about your father

MARY
All I needed to know that he took care
of me - and of my mother for as long
asshe lived He would have married
her but he was already married When
he finally gota divorce it was too late
but he was always there when I needed
him Now thats what I know about my
father Mr Biegler Will that as you
say back up Laura Manions story

PAUL
Misa Pilant Im not trying to get at you
or hurt you
(MORE)

94 PAUL (contd)

a l appreciate your affection for your
father -- but as a lawyer I have had
to learn that people are not just good
or just bad but many things - andI
think maybe Barney Quill was many
things --

MARY
I dont want

PAUL

Now just - hear me out please I

believe that Barney told Al Paquette

what happened that night and sent Al

to the window here to watch out for

Manion - while he stood by by one of

his gun racks - waiting Manion came

‘ in and fired almost the moment he

entered the door and that first shot went

right through Barneys heart All I
want is for you to try and persuade Al
to come into court as a defense witness
and tell the court what Barney told him
- that he had raped and assaulted Mrs
Manion

i) MARY
Al wouldnt conceal that Why wouldnt
he tell it if it were true

PAUL
Everybody loves something or someone
Me I love fishing and an old guy named
Parnell Manion loves his freedom -
hed like more of it Barney loved you
-- and maybe so does Al I wouldnt
blame him He doesnt want youto
know the truth about Barney that he
could bebrutal ‘and dangerous But if
you ask Al straight out

She stares at Paul for a long time -- then calls

MARY

father and he thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed -
something you wont tell

AL
Lawyer I told you once and Ill tell
you again No questions no answers

MARY
Wait Al Did my father rape Mrs
Manion

AL

Barney wouldnt hurt a woman He was
a good guy - just like you thought

MARY
Is there any reason you wouldnt tell
me the truth Al

AL
(a queer pause)
What reason

‘MARY
Anything else Mr Biegler

PAUL
(rises puts on the
wet hat)
Ill leave a pass for you and Al at the
trial You might like to watch Lt
Manion get convicted

He goes to the deor

Mary being Barneys kid

95 COURTROOM - DAY

Manion is on the stand He is cool straight-forward at ease and
alert Paul is questioning

- PAUL
Now lets get at that rosary thing
It has been testified that your wife
swore to you on a rosary that she
had been raped by Barney Quill Did
you ask her to swear on a rosary

MANION
My wife was hysterical and wasnt
making much sense I thought if I
asked her to take an oath on the rosary
it might serve to calm her and make
her think clearly

PAUL
Did the rosary help

MANION
She was able to tell me in detail what
had happened

PAUL
Now go on from here What did you
do then Lieutenant

MANION
I had her lie on the bed and I got some
cold cloths for her head and -- oh yes ©
I gave her a drink of brandy After a
while she became quiet and seemed to
goto sleep Then I went to the closet
and got my gun and loaded it

PAUL
Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill

C) No
PAUL

Why did you get your gun and load it

MANION

MANION
I knew I had to go to Quills bar and I
thought I might need it

PAUL
Why

MANION
I knew Mr Quill kept guns behind the
bar I was afraid he might shoot me

PAUL
—-—Might shoot you if you did what What
were you going to do

MANION

Im not sure I remember I had some
idea of finding him and holding him
while I called the police

PAUL
But Mr Lemon right in the tourist
park was a deputy sheriff Why didnt
you get him to go with you

- MANION
I dont know why I didnt think of Mr
Lemon Maybe because he always
seemed to be nothing except the old
caretaker of the park Maybe because
I wasnt thinking too clearly about
anything except finding Barney

‘ Quill

PAUL
Why didnt you go to the telephone
and call the State Police before you
went to the bar

MANION
I dont know why I was in sort of
a daze It wasan awful thing to see
what had been done to my wife

PAUL
You say you were ina daze When
you got to the bar -- did you see that
the bar was crowded

Not clearly

143

MANION
I dont remember anyone at that bar
except Barney Quill He was the only
person I saw

PAUL
What was he doing ©

MANION
I think he was just standing behind
the bar

PAUL
Did he make a threatening move to
reach for a gun

MANION —

I dont know He might have but I
dont know
PAUL

Now since you went there to find him
and hold him for the police why did

you shoot him

MANION
I dont remember shooting him

PAUL
As you left the bar do you remember
Alphonse Paquette stopping you and
saying youd better not run away from
this -- and your reply -- Do you
want some too Buster

MANION
I seem to have a vague recollection
of soméone speaking to me but I
dont remember what I said or what

‘was said to me

PAUL
Do you remember going home

MANION

PAUL
When did you realize you had shot
Quill ‘
MANION
I was getting a drink of water

Will you please show the Court how
you knew the gun was empty

MANION

shooting did you love your wife

MANION

Very much
Lauras face as she watches Manion is without emotion

PAUL

Dancer comes over slowly twisting a ring on his finger stands
‘smiling at Manion Manion faces him calmly

DANCER
Lieutenant Manion how many men
have you killed

PAUL
Now wait a minute Your honor a
mans war record - in Lieutenant
Manions case a great record --
certainly should not be used against
him -

G

‘ Many times

145

DANCER
Your honor Im as patriotic as the
next man but the simple truth is that
war can condition a man to killing
other men I only wish to determine
how conditioned the lieutenant may
be to the use of fire arms on another
human being

JUDGE WEAVER
I dont approve of the question Mr
Biegler but on the other hand I
dont see how I can turn it down
Lets see what Mr Dancer is going
to do with the information Take the
answer

MANION
I know I killed at least four men in
Korea Threé of them with a hand
grenade and one with my service
automatic I may have killed others
A soldier doesnt always know

DANCER
Now Lieutenant in these acts of
killing did you ever have a lapse
of memory such as you had when you
killed Barney Quill

MANION
No sir
DANCER
Did you ever have a lapse of memory
during battle
MANION
No sir ee
DANCER

Were you ever submitted to a constant
barrage constantly in a sweat for
many hours constantly under attack
or attacking

MANION

DANCER

Were you ever treated for shell shock
battle fatigue or any war neurosis or
psychosis

MANION
No

DANCER
Did you ever experience an unusual
mental state during the war

MANION
I do remember having one great urge

DANCER
What was that

MANION
To get the hell out and go home

The laughter cores

JUDGE WEAVER
(rapping for silence)
The defendant will confine himselfto - - — — -
the seriousness of his present - ane
situation

MANION
Im sorry your honor

Dancer has taken the joke with good humor

DANCER
I sympathize with the Lieutenant
I expect he has the same feeling
about being in jail The main point
here Lieutenant is that in all of
your war service you had no record
of mental disturbance You were
at all times in possession of your
faculties

me ” MANION’
Yessir “Thats right

DANCER
No more questions

A BUZZ goes through the courtroom Was this all that Dancer

came back in and sat on the bed he
had a gun in his hand and I said
‘What are you going to do And he
said I think Ive already done it
I think Ive killed Barney Quill

What did he mean -- forgot about
what

— LAURA

He meant hed forgotten that Mr Lemion

was a Deputy Sheriff and he said Yes
Ill go turn myself in to Mr Lemon

PAUL
Your honor I have no other direct
questions at this time But since Im
sure the credulity of the Court has
been strained about the part the
little dog played on this night I
should like a few minutes to show
the Court this remarkable little
animal

JUDGE WEAVER
Do the People have objections

DANCER»

- I know if we raise an objection Mr

Biegler will declare that we are
haters of all small furry animals

her purse Paul places the dog on the floor and the dog runs to
Laura romping in delight as he sees the flashlight

Id like the Court to notice that the
dog will turn the light on

Laura puts the flashlight on the floor ‘and Muff paws atit seizes

it in his mouth his teeth over the switch The light goes on

PAUL
Your honor if counsel wants to know
the grounds for Mrs Manions divorce --
let him ask that question

What were the grounds for divorce
Mrs Manion -

LAURA
Mental cruelty

DANCER
Naturally How long was it after your
divorce that you married Lieutenant

Manion
LAURA
Im Im not sure
PAUL
(quickly)

May I refresh the witnesss memory
for Mr Dancer

DANCER
By all means

PAUL
I believe she told me that they were
married three days after the divorce

Laura and Paul have locked eyes He is deliberately showing
her that she must not be evasive Dancer looks from one to
the other grasping the situation

DANCER
Thank you Mr Biegler Is that
correct Mrs Manion 8
LAURA

Yes

DANCER
Then unless yours was a whirlwind
courtship you must have known
Lieutenant Manion before your
divorce Did you

LAURA
Yes

151

97 On the jury a couple of women exchange significant looks

DANCER
What is your religious affiliation
Mrs Manion

LAURA
Im a Catholic

DANCER
A Catholic in good standing

LAURA
Well no - the divorce -- you know

DANCER
You mean you have been ex communicated
because of the divorce

LAURA
Yes

DANCER
Mrs Manion wouldnt you say that
a Catholic who can blithely ignore
a cardinal rule of her church can
a also easily ignore an oath taken on
one of its artifacts -- say an oath
taken on a rosary

LAURA
I dont think thats true

DANCER
But wouldnt you think thered be
some doubt about the integrity of
such a person

I dont know Al r know i is the
rosary means something to me

DANCER
(smoothly)
I see Weil Ill pass on to something
else

The ANGLE of the CAMERA is such that we can see that Dancer
has blocked Pauls view of Laura Paul moves to another chair

Anything else Mr Biegler

The courtroom becomes quiet and Dancer continues

DANCER
Would you have-gone to the Inn if
your husband had been awake

LAURA
He would probably have gone with me

DANCER
But would you have gone alone

‘Well not if he didnt want me to

DANCER
Would he have not wanted you to

LAURA
Im not sure I dont know how to
answer that

DANCER
Had you ever gone before to the
Thunder Bay Inn or elsewhere in
Thunder Bay at night -- alone

LAURA
Yes Sometimes

DANCER
Did your husband know you were going

LAURA
Not always He goes to sleep early
and sometimes Im restless

DANCER
Where did you go on these occasions

LAURA
I took a walk by the lake or I went
to the bingo place or maybe to the

DANCER
Did you ever go to meet another man

LAURA
No Nol didnot I never did that

DANCER
Do you mean to say Mrs Manion
that a lovely woman like yourself
attractive to men lonely restless --
that you never

PAUL
Objection your honor The witness
answered the question about other
men Counsel is now making a
veiled suggestion for the jury

DANCER
I withdraw the question Now Mrs
Manion onthese occasional
excursions intothe night did you
always go and return alone

LAURA °
Of course

DANCER

But Mrs Manion you testified

that you got into Barney Quills car
because you were afraid to go home
alone Why were you so frightened
on that particular night

LAURA
I said it was because he told me that
bears had been seen around

DANCER
Was this the first time youd heard
of bears coming around Thunder Bay
to pick up scraps

LAURA
No
DANCER
Had you seen the bears around before
LAURA
Yes
DANCER

Then this was just the first time that
you were afraid of them

LAURA
No I was always afraid of them
DANCER

Then this was the first time you were
enough afraid to allow a man to take

‘you home from one of your evening

prowls

PAUL
Objection The use of the word
‘prowl is intended to mislead the
jury
JUDGE WEAVER
Sustained Ask the question again

DANCER
Im sorry Mrs Manion I didnt
mean to imply that you were a
huntress -- so lets say evening

Come Mrs Manion you should be
able to tell us that straight off
Its a simple enough question

Laura is pale and shaky She dabs at her lips and forehead with
her handkerchief

PAUL
Your honor how can the witness answer
straight off if the counsel interrupts
her answer

JUDGE WEAVER
Witness seemed rather slow to me
Mr Biegler However Id let the
witness complete a statement if
she can Mr Dancer before you
interrupt

DANCER
Of course your honor In any case
Mr Bieglers objection has given
Mrs Manion sufficient time to think
of an answer to my question Youve
thought of one haven’ t you Mrs
Manion

LAURA
What I was going to say is that I
didnt want to offend Mr Quill by ©
making him think I was afraid of
him or didnt like him He had
been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we were in his bar

DANCER
Thats very good Mrs Manion
very good indeed

PAUL
Your honor

JUDGE WEAVER
Attorney for the People will save
his comments for the arguments

DANCER

against the wall

He was drinking
DANCER

Now Ill ask you -- on the night of
the shoating what did you swear

LAURA
It was about Barney Quill raping me

DANCER
Why did you swear on the rosary that
he had raped you

LAURA
For the reason that my husband said
-- Iwas hysterical

That was the reason he gave for
asking you to swear What was your
reason for swearing

DISSOLVE TO

103 INT COURTROOM - DAY

Dr Smith in his horn-rimmed glasses is on the stand Parnell
with Maida on the spectators bench behind defense table Paul is
interrogating

PAUL
Doctor have you formed an opinion
as to Frederick Manions emotional
disorganization at the time he killed
Barney Quill

SMITH
I have

PAUL
What is that opinion

SMITH
He was temporarily insane at the
time of the shooting

PAUL
At the time of the shooting do you
believe that he was able to distinguish
right from wrong

SMITH
He may or may not have been It
doesnt make too much difference

Paul glances toward the prosecution table
in a whispering huddle Paul half-grins

PAUL
Now doctor as clearly as you can
will you explain Frederick Manions
temporary insanity

SMITH
It is known as dissociative reaction
A psychic shock which creates an
almost overwhelming tension which
the person in shock must alleviate
In Lieutenant Manions case a soldier
it is natural that he would turn to
action Only direct simple action
against Barney Quill would relieve
this unbearable tension This is not
too uncommon For example in
combat -- in war I mean -- some of
the more remarkable heroics take
place in this state of mind Soldiers
who have performed fantastically
brave acts are frequently unable to
recall having performed those acts
because they were at the time in
the grip of dissociative reaction

PAUL

Is there another name for dissociative

reaction one we are more likely to
recognize

SMITH -
Yes It has been known as
‘irresistible impulse

PAUL
Now doctor a man in the grip of
irresistible impulse-- would he be-

‘likely to go to a neighbor for advice

would he call the police to come to
his aid

SMITH
Completely incompatible In this
trancelike state he would be unable
to think of anything except the relief
of this massive tension

PAUL
But our man was able to think of
taking out a gun and loading it before
he set off to find Barney Quill
(MORE)

Dancer and Mitch are

)

169
103 ‘ ‘ PAUL (contd)
oO He testified that he got the gun
a because he was afraid Quill would
shoot him If he was in a trance-like
state how do you explain this

SMITH
That was his conscious mind working --
but if no gun had been available he
would have gone anyway -- bare-handed -
he would have walked into the mouth
of a cannon Its important to
understand that the very essence
of his manhood was at stake Nothing
short of oblivion or death could have
prevailed against his overpowering
need

PAUL
Would this tension interfere with
his physical ability -- say his ability
to accurately fire a gun

SMITH
It probably would have heightened
his ability
oD PAUL

How would a man look when in the
grip of dissociative reaction

SMITH
He might appear to be deadly calm --
fiercely deliberate

PAUL
Gould you describe his behavior as
being like a mailman delivering « the
mail

SMITH
Thats not bad Like a mailman he
would have one job to do and he
would do it

PAUL
Would a man in this state be apt to
converse with other men

SMITH
Its possible although he wouldnt
likely initiate conversation

es a oo
pasa

103 PAUL
Do you mean that if someone stopped
him and spoke to him he might answer
but he wouldnt be likely to speak first

SMITH
Not likely --

PAUL

Dancer rises During his first few questions Paul is surveying
the courtroom -- then bends to Maida and whispers --

PAUL
Can you spot Mary Pilant

MAIDA
She didnt come back after lunch
Youd better give up on that one

DANCER
Doctor did you find any psychosis in
Frederick Manion

SMITH
I did not

DANCER
Any neuroses

SMITH
I found no history of neuroses

DANCER

Did you find any history of delusion
2 SMITH
None

DANCER
Loss of memory

SMITH
Not before this instance

DANCER
How about hallucinations

SMITH

No

rer

103 DANCER
Any history of conversion hysteria

SMITH
Well irresistible impulse embraces
what has been called conversion
hysteria

DANCER
In common language isnt conversion
hysteria also known as a fit of temper

SMITH
I know of no reputable psychiatrist
who would so describe it

DANCER
But a layman might call it that

SMITH
Probably yes

DANCER
Isnt that what really happened In
a fit of temper -- in a fit of rage the
Lieutenant walked over and sho
Barney Quill

SMITH

‘No not in my opinion That is not

what happened

DANCER
Doctor you stated that the Lieutenant
might or might not have been able to
distinguish right from wrong -- but
that it didnt make much difference
Am I right Is that what you said

SMITH
Approximately -- yes

DANCER
Did you mean that at the time of the
shooting he could have known the
difference between right and wrong

SMITH
He might have yes

171

DANCER
Doctor Smith if the defendant could
have known what he was doing and
could have known that it was wrong
how can you come here and testify
that he was legally insane

SMITH
Im not saying he was legally insane
Im a doctor not a lawyer Im
saying that in his mental condition
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong -
he would still have shot Quill He
could not have prevented himself
from doing so

DANCER
In other words what he did he did
willfully and in anger

—— SMITH
The words tanger and wiliful are
an immense simplification of a very
complicated mental condition I
repeat Lieutenant Manion was
temporarily insane

DANCER
Are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion

SMITH
Iam

Dr Harcourt where did you receive
your university training

HARCOURT
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore Maryland

DANCER
When were you admitted to the practice
of medicine

HARCOURT
1924

DANCER
Since that time have you specialized
in any particular field of medicine

NY

HARCOURT
Thave -- the field of psychiatry

DANCER
Where do you practice now

HARCOURT
Iam the medical superintendent of the
Bonder State Hospital for the insane
Iam also psychiatric examiner for the
Veterans Administration

DANCER
Do you then feel that you have particular
knowledge of the mental ills and problems
of soldiers

HARCOURT
I do

DANCER
It has been stated here that dissociative
reaction or irresistible impulse is not
uncommon among soldiers in combat
Do you agree with that statement

HARCOURT
Ido But not as it was put by Dr Smith
DANCER
Where would you depart from Dr Smith
HARCOURT

Well dissociative reaction is not
something which comes out of the

blue and disappears as quickly It
can only occur -- even among soldiers
in combat -- if the individual has a
psycho-neurotic condition of long
‘standing a vos

PAUL
I object Your Honor Is the Doctor
stating a proved fact or an opinion
We are not dealing here with chicken
pox or a sore throat but with the
mysteries of the human mind If
the Doctor is giving his opinion it
should be qualified as such

JUDGE WEAVER
Sustained Do you want to straighten
this out Mr Dancer

O

Nae

DANCER
Your answer Doctor was of course
your opinion wasnt it

HARCOURT

That goes without saying doesnt it

PAUL
No it doesnt Your Honor

JUDGE WEAVER
(patiently)
Just say it is your opinion Doctor
please

HARCOURT
My answer was an opinion

(sitting)
All right

DANCER
Iam sure the jury has forgotten your
answer by now Doctor Lets go back
Is it your opinion that dissociative
reaction could not occur one time
and one time only

HARCOURT
Yes There would have been repeated
upsets of a dissociative nature

DANCER
It has been testified here that a
psychiatric examination of the
defendant showed no evidence of
neuroses or history of dissociative
reaction You have heard it further

“testified here that the defendants ©

behavior on the night of the shooting
was cool and direct As an observer
do you remember this testimony

HARCOURT
Yes

DANCER
From this have you formed an opinion
about the defendants sanity on the
night of the shooting

177

HARCOURT
Yes Iam of the opinion that he was
in sufficient possession of his faculties
go that he was not dominated by his
unconscious mind

DANCER
In other words he was not in the grip
of irresistible impulse

HARCOURT
In my opinion he was not

DANCER
Your witness Mr Biegler

PAUL
Dr Harcourt psychiatry is an effort
to probe into the dark undiscovered
world of the mind - and in there the
world might well be round or it could
be square - your opinion could be
wrong and Dr Smiths opinion could
be right isnt that true

HARCOURT
Id be a poor Doctor if I didnt agree
with that But I believe my opinion
to be right

PAUL
And good Doctor that you are you
very carefully used the word believe
didnt you

HARCOURT
Yes

PAUL
Do you think you would have been less
positive if you had examined the
defendant as Dr Smith did

HARCOURT
I believe ‘it would have helped to
confirm my opinion

PAUL
But isnt it possible it might have
caused you to change this opinion

HARCOURT
I dont believe so

O

a

PAUL
Doctor did you ask to make an
examination of the defendant

HARCOURT
No sir

PAUL
Did the attorneys for the people petition
for such an examination in your behalf

HARCOURT
No sir

PAUL
So your opinion boils down to a snap
judgment doesnt it

HARCOURT
No It is as careful a judgment as the
circumstances permit

PAUL
Dr Smiths opinion was made under
better circumstances wasnt it

HARCOURT
If you mean that he was able to examine
the man yes

PAUL
Thank you Doctor

DANCER
Doctor upon what do you base your
opinions

HARCOURT
Upon ‘the findings of other doctors —
and largely uponmy own years of —
study and analysis

DANCER
Are those many years

HARCOURT
Over thirty years

DANCER
You were working in this field probably
before Dr Smith was born werent you

DANCER

Tell the Court what Lieutenant Manion

MILLER
Well I said are things looking up
Lieutenant And he said I got it
made Buster He said I fooled
my lawyer and I fooled that head
shrinker and Im going to fool that
bunch of corn cobbers on the jury

MANION
violently
Youre a liar Youre a lousy

stinking liar
The Judge raps for order Paul draws Manion back into his seat

PAUL
I apologize for my client Your Honor
Yet his outburst is almost excusable
since the prosecution has seen fit to
put a felon on the stand to testify against
an officer in the United States Army

DANCER
(angry)
Your Honor I dont know who is the
worse offender -- Manion or his

lawyer

“JUDGE ‘WEAVER

(patience lost)
Were close to the end In the name of
heaven lets have peace and courtesy
for these last few hours Mr Dancer
you will continue your interrogation
without comment Mr Biegler will
not perorate at every opportunity and
the defendant will remain in his chair
and keep his mouth shut

He punctuates the end of his speech with a bang of his gavel Paul
sits humbly Dancer takes out his handkerchief and dabs at his
forehead Manion white and furious sinks down into his chair

™ MILLER
Huh Oh -- well I waa in reform school
when I was a kid Thats all

PAUL
Your honor I would like to see this mans
criminal record

JUDGE WEAVER
Do you have the record Mr Lodwick

MITCH
(sheepishly)
Yes sir here it is

Mitch produces several cards clipped together Paul strides to the
prosecution table takes the cards flips through them

PAUL
Mr Miller this record shows youy ve
been in prison six times in three different
states Youve been in three times for
arson twice for assault with a deadly
weapon once for larceny It also shows
youve done short stretches in four city
jails for the charges of indecent exposure
window peeping perjury and committing
a public nuisance Is this your true
record

MILLER
Well therm things never are right

Paul stalks back to the prosecution table angrily tosses the record on
the table Mitch is embarrassed but Dancer is imperturbable as

usual

PAUL
Mr Miller how ‘did you get the éar of
the prosecution in order to tell them
about your conversation with Lieutenant

Manion
MILLER
The D A was taking us to his office
PAUL
Taking who to his office

lawyer took us to his office and asked

us questions about Lieutenant Manion

PAUL
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you would go on the witness stand

DANCER
The People object Your Honor to
being

‘JUDGE WEAVER
(snapping him off)
Overruled Take the answer

MILLER
1 wasnt promised anything

PAUL
Perhaps you just thought it might
help your own troubles if you dreamed
up a story that would please the D A

MILLER
I didnt dream up nothing

PAUL
And youre sure thats what Lieutenant
Manion said ©

MILLER
Yep Im sure

PAUL
Just as sure as you were about your

MILLER
Well I kind of flubbed that I guess
PAUL
(with great distaste
I dont feel I can dignify this creature
with any more questions

He returns to beside Manion Dancer smiles and bows to the Judge

DANCER
No further questions Your Honor

186

107 JUDGE WEAVER
Take the witness away

Miller steps down grinning and is led away by Sheriff Battisfore

JUDGE WEAVER
(continue s)
Mr Biegler would you like to have a
conference with your client I can
see that Miller was very much of a
surprise

PAUL

- No Your Honor we tont need a

conference Ill recall Lieutenant
Manion to the stand right now

Manion goes to the stand

PAUL
(continues)
Youve heard the testimony of this
Miller Is any part of it true

MANION
None

PAUL
(studying Manion
for a moment)
Lieutenant do you have any idea why
he might come in here with a tale

like that
MANION
No
PAUL
Have you ever talked with this man
MANION
Yes
PAUL

What did you talk about

- MANION
Nothing important Certainly nothing
about my personal life or feelings

PAUL
That is all I wanted to know

107 DANCER
Lieutenant Manion have you ever had
any sort of trouble with Miller

MANION
Trouble I dont know -- you mean
an argument -- something like that

DANCER
Did you ever attack Miller -- physically
attack Miller

Paul realizes Dancer has used Miller as bait to get Manion back on
the stand Manion looks to Paul for help

DANCER
Your attorney cant answer the question
for you Lieutenant Manion Did you
ever physically attack Miller

MANION
I dont think you could call it an attack
I pushed his head against the bars one
day

DANCER
Why

MANION
He said something ugly about my wife

DANCER
Do you clearly remember pushing or
bumping his head against the bars

MANION
Sure I just told you
DANCER
Then this was not dissociative reaction
PAUL

The defendant is not qualified to answer
that

JUDGE WEAVER
Sustained

DANCER
Lieutenant Manion wasnt your action
against Barney Quill much the same
thing as your action against Miller or the
Lieutenant you slapped at the cocktail
party all done in the heat of anger with
a willful conscious desire to hurt or kill

‘No sir

MANION
I dont remember my action against
Quill
’ DANCER

How long had you known your wife was
stepping out with Quill

MANION
I never knew anything like that I
trust my wife

DANCER
You just occasionally beat her up for
the fun of it I suppose

PAUL
(desperately)

188

There has been nothing established to
permit a question like that He keeps
trying to insinuate without ever coming
to the point Let him ask the Lieutenant
did he ever beat his wife

JUDGE WEAVER
I will sustain the objection Do you
want to re-phrase your question Mr

Dancer

DANCER
(pleased)
No thank you Your Honor Ive finished

PAUL
Ill ask it Did you Lieutenant Manion
ever beat your wife on the night of the
shooting or any other time

- MANION
PAUL

Is there any doubt in your mind that
Barney Quill raped Mrs Manion

MANION
No sir

PAUL
Thats all

DANCER

Nothing more

O

S

189

JUDGE WEAVER
Step down Lieutenant

Manion comes down to take his seat at the defense table under Pauls
hard gaze

PAUL
We walked into that one

MANION
Im sorry I should have told you
about Miller Are we hurt

PAUL
Bad

Parnell comes hobbling down the center aisle from the main courtroom
doors

JUDGE WEAVER
(watching Parnell
Does the prosecution have any other
rebuttal witnesses

MITCH
(watching Parnell)
No Your Honor We have no other
witnesses

Parnell bends over the railing whispers to Paul

JUDGE WEAVER
Does the defense have any rebuttal
witnesses

PAUL
Your Honor I know time is very
pressing and I dont want to ask
for arecess But I would like to
leave the courtroom for a moment

JUDGE WEAVER
Well I suppose if its important we
can be at ease for a minute

MITCH
This is highly irregular Your Honor

JUDGE WEAVER
Mr Lodwick there is no reason as
the saying goes to make a federal
case out of this Youre excused
Mr Biegler

Paul and Parnell hurry up the aisle their heads close together
talking as they go hastening through the main doors into the corridor
All eyes in the courtroom remain on the doors The silence is
tempered by a low mumble of conversation A few moments pass
Dancer glances at his wristwatch shrugs his impatience to Mitch
Judge Weaver takes out his watch winds it motions to Sheriff
Battisfore to approach the bench

JUDGE WEAVER
(in undertone)
Sheriff will you see if Mr Bieglers
gone fishing

Sheriff Battisfore trots up the center aisle and disappears through the
main doors Almost immediately he returns followed by Paul
Parnell and Mary Pilant

ee PAUL

Lt (coming through
the gate)
Thank you very much Your Honor
’ Inow have a rebuttal witness The
defense calls Mary Pilant to the stand

DANCER

as Mary approaches)
Your Honor wed like to protest this
affair The noble defense attorney
rushes out to a secret conference and
now the last minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the center
aisle The whole thing has obviously
been rigged to unduly excite the jury
Its just another of Mr Bieglers
cornball tricks

PAUL
Your Honor I dont blame Mr Dancer
for feeling put upon Imjust a humble
‘country lawyer trying to-do the best I
can against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing

The jury glowers at Dancer and he paces away angrily Paul
suppresses a grin

JUDGE WEAVER
(sighing gloomily)
Swear the witness

from the rag bin

MARY
(opens her purse)
Yes

She hands a folded pair of panties to Paul

PAUL -

badly torn -- as if they had been ripped
apart by powerful hands ‘The label
treads Smartshop - Phoenix Arizona

SUDGE WEAVER

will be received in evidence

PAUL
Thats all Miss Pilant

At the prosecution table Dancer rises cold and determined

DANCER
Did you ever talk with Mr Lodwick
the prosecuting attorney about Quills
death
MARY
Yes he came to the hotel several
times after Mr Quill was killed

DANCER
Did you tell Mr Lodwick that you
‘didnt believe that Barney Quill raped
Mrs Manion

MARY
Yes I told him that

DANCER
Now Miss Pilant did you ever talk
to the defense attorney Mr Biegler

MARY
Yes

DANCER

shooting of Barney Quill

MARY
Yes
DANCER
How many times did you talk to Mr
Biegler
MARY
Twice
DANCER
When was the last time
MARY

Last night

Dancer glances significantly at Paul quickens the pace of his

interrogation

DANCER
Have you now changed your mind
about Barney Quill Do you now
believe he raped Mrs Manion

MARY
I-- I dont know now I think he
might have

DANCER

When did you change your mind - --
was it last night -

MARY
No -- -- it was here this morning

DANCER
When were you given the panties Was
it last night

PAUL
Now wait a minute just wait a

Mr Biegler

194
G

107 PAUL
On second thought I dont object
Your Honor Id like the jury to hear
her answer

JUDGE WEAVER
Witness may answer

MARY
NoI was not given the panties last
night or any other time I found them
exactly like I said

DANCER
Do you know for a fact Barney Quill
dropped the panties in the laundry
chute or did you just assume it

MARY
l assumed it

DANCER
Had you thought that perhaps someone
else might have dropped them there
Someone who wanted them found in
the hotel laundry

MARY
I hadnt thought about that

DANCER
And in the grip of what Mr Biegler
might call dissociative reaction you
rushed in here with the panties because
you wanted to crucify the character of
the dead Barney Quill -- isnt that

right
‘MARY

No I felt it was my duty to
DANCER

Your pride was hurt wasnt it
MARY

I dont know what you mean

PAUL
Your honor hes trying to confuse
the witness Let him ask questions
that she can understand

195

She looks heiplessly at Paul

JUDGE WEAVER
Yes Mr Dancer -- Id like to know
what youre getting at myself

DANCER
When you found the panties Miss Pilant
was your first thought that Quill might
have raped Mrs Manion - or was it
that he might have been stepping out
with Mrs Manion

MARY -
(to the Judge)
What does he mean I dont know
what he means

‘ JUDGE WEAVER
Mr Dancer I must again ask you to
put straight questions to the witness

DANCER

“This is a straight question Your Honor

Were you Barney Quills mistress
Miss Pilant

MARY
(almost weeping
with fury)
No no I was not

DANCER
Do you know that its common knowledge
in Thunder Bay that you were living
with Quill

MARY
Thats not true Barney Quill was -

DANCER
Was what Miss Pilant

DANCER
(continues)
Barney Quill was what Miss Pilant

MARY
(defiantly)
He was my father

Theres nothing he can do

196

197

The courtroom whispers and mumbles Dancer is stunned He stares
at Mary for a long moment then sping to glare at Paul Paul plays

it straight but he cant keep the triumphant glitter from showing in
his eyes Dancer relaxes A smile touches his lips He inclines

his head ina tiny bowto Paul — ‘

DANCER
No more questions Your Honor

PAUL
Thats all for me Your Honor

JUDGE WEAVER
The witriess may step down

Mary leaves the stand bravely head up Paul escorts her to sit
beside Parnell and Maida

judgment they must become of one

that they can do it -- and most of
the time do it right well God
