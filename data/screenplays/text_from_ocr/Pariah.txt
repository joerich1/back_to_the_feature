“WHEREVER THE BIRD WITH NO FEET FLEW SHE FOUND TREES WITH NO
LIMBS --- AUDRE LORDE
FADE IN

1 EXTINT NIGHTCLUB- EVENING

A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders jeans and
hats crosses a narrow street Lights flare hands are

stamped torsos are patted down Money exchanges hands We
descend into a black throbbing tunnel

Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers Hips legs
feet dancing

A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole Hoots
and cheers

The dancer marches in place rolling her thonged bottom
More cheers greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband

FEMALE DJ (0S)
Lets go Where all my sexy
Sagittarian ladies at

Arms go up A collection of whoops ripple the crowd

The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward
headfirst The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted
heels into the crowd We realize that she has been dancing
on the ceiling

FEMALE DJ (0S)
Oh my God

ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY) 17 covers her mouth laughing
and wide-eyed She tries to back away from the stage but is
pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar
bills Among them is LAURA 18 worldly and smooth

LAURA
Where your singles at Where your
singles at Yeah baby

Laura strains over Alikes shoulder to tuck a bill into the
dancers boot Alike drops her beer in all the jostling

FEMALE DJ
Goddamn I love my job

Laura stuffs a bill into Alikes now empty hand and forcibly
waves Alikes wrist in the air

Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins
to direct her attention at her

ALIKE
Stop Chill

LAURA
Whatchu come here for

Alike shoves the dollar bill into Lauras chest and shoulders
her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage
Laura shrugs puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at
the edge of the stage Alike looks away and breaks through a
snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend

ALIKE
Excuse me Sorry Excuse me Oof
sorry ladies

Finally free of the throng Alike takes a breath and looks at
the clock on her cell phone

ALIKE (CONTD)
Shit

She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer
visible Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing
crowd she retreats for the bar

FEMALE DJ
Lets go

INT NIGHTCLUB BAR- NIGHT

Alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar Her gaze settles
on a CUTE GIRL a little ways down staring out at the dance
floor Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her
shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl

ALIKE
Hi

The girl ignores her Alike clears her throat and speaks a
little too loudly

ALIKE (CONTD)
Umm Hey How are you

The girl jerks around and frowns at Alike looking her up and
down

CUTE GIRL
What

ALIKE
Ummsorry I was just sayin
Ummhi

CUTE GIRL
Oh

The girl dismisses Alike and turns back toward the floor

ALIKE
Oh You wanna drink or something
Hey Hey Over here

Alike strains snapping at the bartender A CONFIDENT WOMAN
swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand The cute
girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance
floor Alike looks around just in time to see her leaving
The bartender finally materializes and Alike slinks away

INT NIGHTCLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT

Alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the
cramped 2 stall bathroom A COUPLE in front of her makes out
vigorously and she folds her arms and looks away

A buff 30-SOMETHING WOMAN with locs smiles and winks at
Alike Alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks
away The line inches forward Alike glances around
searching for the woman The 30-something has already lost
interest her attention now fully directed at a much more
FEMININE WOMAN strutting out of the restroom Embarrassed
Alike faces front again Two androgynous gangsters (AGs) who
have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer
Alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance One of
the AGs breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the
line inches forward again Alike pretends not to notice and
slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch
along the wall

INT NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER

Alike dozes on the couch

FEMALE DJ
Give it up for Sin-A-Min ladies

Alike wakes with a start She checks the time on her cell
phone Cursing she scrambles up from the couch

INT NIGHTCLUB BAR - EVENING
Laura dances with a cute SHORT HAIRED GIRL
Alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction

ALIKE

ALIKE

LAURA

ALIKE
What

Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair
continue their wobbling uneven groove Alike endures several
moments of invisibility as a sea of women both feminine
and butch push past her without a second glance Alike tugs
at Lauras jersey Laura happily tangled in her dance
partners embrace rolls her eyes

LAURA
Stop pulling on my clothes

EXT BUS STOP- NIGHT

Laura sulks frowning out at the night Alike extends the
olive branch

ALIKE

ALIKE

LAURA

ALIKE

Laura snatches the phone from Alike Alike swipes at it but
misses Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through
the numbers with the other

LAURA

math class Denise What

Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her
sleeve

INT BUS - NIGHT

Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears
on A middle-class Bronx landscape well-lit with a newly
constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the
window Alike reaches over and presses the tape Laura elbows
Alike
LAURA

LAURA

door

ALIKE

Alike elbows Laura sharply The bus driver frowns in the rear
view

LAURA
You aint gotta push me whyre you

ALIKE

Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door

LAURA
You got a problem Call me

ALIKE
Ima call you

Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away Laura drums a
little beat on Alikes window as the bus pulls off Alike
waves and faces forward again An OLD LADY sitting nearby
shoots her a disapproving look Alike rolls her eyes and
moves to a seat farther away

8 INT BUS - CONTINUOUS

Alike studies her reflection in the window and takes a
breath She unbuttons her bulky mens shirt to reveal a
fitting baby doll shirt that reads Princess She stuffs
her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair
of small gold hoop earrings into her ears She slumps back
against the seat and stares into the night

The bus stops at a lonely island of curb Alike is a dark
silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night

9 INT ALIKES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip
through The house is dark except for the flashing microwave
clock

Alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway Her
younger sister SHARONDAs door cracks open as she passes

SHARONDA

(whispering)
Be quiet
SHARONDA

Alike shoves her sister and tries to close the door Sharonda
yanks the door open wider

SHARONDA
(whispering)

ALIKE
(whispering)

SHARONDA
I know what stays open past

midnight

Sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance

ALIKE
Shut up
Alike eases Sharondas door shut Sharonda swings the door
open wide
SHARONDA

Good night Lee

Sharonda slams her door The light clicks on underneath
Alikes parents door

AUDREY (0S)
Lee Lee

Alike rolls her eyes at her sisters closed door and shrugs

into her room

10 INT ALIKES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Alike rushes to shove her stuffed backpack under the bed

She tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother AUDREY

appears in the doorway

AUDREY
Nice to know you still live here
Alike peels off her socks and slumps on the bed

AUDREY (CONTD)
Whatre you doing home so late

ALIKE
Lost track of time

AUDREY
You know what time your curfew is
Where were you

ALIKE

AUDREY
The show ended at midnight And

ALIKE

Audrey gets cozy in the doorjamb Alike turns her back on
her and slumps into pajamas

AUDREY
At least you were cute Whered you

Alike winds the princess shirt around her fist and launches
to the top of the closet

ALIKE
Its old

AUDREY
Compliments your figure I saw
something just like it on sale
maybe we could go shopping--

ALIKE
Goodnight

Audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter Vinegar replaces
honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice

AUDREY

I really dont care for that young
lady you run around with anyway

ALIKE
Yeah okay

AUDREY
And tie your head up

Alike snags a satin headscarf from the nightstand and slaps
it around her head

AUDREY (CONT D)
Its your head And you really
should wash your face too

ALIKE
I dont have on make-up

AUDREY
Wash your face anyway

ALIKE
Mom Im seventeen years old

AUDREY
Watch your tone
(Beat)
Well its your skin

Audrey leaves Alike is still She listens for the door to
her parents room to shut before snatching off the scarf and
storming to the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT 11

Alike turns on the faucet wets the soap and puts it back in
the dish wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack
She plops down on the toilet and looks up A crucifix frowns
down at her from the wall

She averts her eyes and stands to leave

AUDREY (0S)
Did you brush your teeth

Alike wets her toothbrush and throws it back into the holder

AUDREY (0S)
Lee

Alike squeezes out a dollop of toothpaste and smears a little
around the sink She stares at her reflection

AUDREY (0S)
Lee

Alike flicks water droplets at the mirror for good measure

ALIKE
Yes mom

EXT SCHOOL - MORNING 12

Alike bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the
perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter STUDENTS
horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups chugging
their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes The school
bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building
Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last
STRAGGLERS finally trickle in She yanks her hoodie tighter
and launches across the lawn and into the building

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING 13

A second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers
and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into
classrooms Alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks
out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the
bathroom One last straggler BINA a 17 year-old girl with
mature but down-to-earth good looks rushes past Alike The
two exchange a brief confused look then mutually dismiss
each other as they hurry in opposite directions

INT SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING 14

Alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut
behind her She rips off her hoodie and the girly shirt
beneath and flings them to the floor She pulls out a pair of
wife-beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head She
unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head

She stares at her reflection in the window and tries
unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt Her eyes scour her
reflection again and again for any imperfections She spots

the earrings and yanks them out of her ears The late bell
beckons and Alike stuffs her feminine clothes into her
backpack and bolts

INT MATH CLASSROOM - DAY 15

The MATH TEACHER glides up and down the aisles passing out
graded tests A chorus of groans follows in her wake

MATH TEACHER
As promised I will be grading
these on a curve

Alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom
The desks in front her and beside her are empty She is
ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes

MATH TEACHER (CONTD)
But the highest grade on the test
was a 98

The math teacher puts Alikes test on her desk and gives her
a little smile Alike doesnt smile back

The lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado clearing the
room in a rush of limbs shouts and backpacks Alike jabs
her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very
deliberately letting the eye of the storm pass over her
before heading toward the door

INT SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY 16

The cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying
Clusters of girls and boys loud-talk flirt fight and
horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the
walls Alike walks alone staying at the fringes of the crowd
and shrugs through the cafeteria line

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 17

Alike flees the cafeteria tray laden with rubbery cuisine of
dubious nutritional value She raps on the door of a
classroom and slips in

MRS ALVARADO (0S)
Hey there

INT AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY 18

ALIKE
Hey

MRS ALVARADO a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type
reclines with her feet on her desk munching on celery sticks
and sunflower seed paste Her small desk radio plays
alternative rock Sun beams into the empty classroom and
Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and
pulls up a chair next to her desk

MRS ALVARADO
Whaddja bring me

ALIKE
Nothin you can eat

MRS ALVARADO
You shouldnt be eatin that crap

ALIKE
(over a mouthful of pizza)

MRS ALVARADO
Sooo wheres the new stuff

Alike hands over her purple and white composition book Mrs
Alvarado thumbs the pages reading silently

MRS ALVARADO
Hmmm

ALIKE
Did you see the one in the back

Mrs Alvarado flips to the back of the book and her mouth
moves silently as she reads

ALIKE (CONTD)
Ill probably do it in class

Mrs Alvarado hands the book back to Alike and digs in to
another celery stick

ALIKE
So

MRS ALVARADO
So what

ALIKE
What do you think

MRS ALVARADO
Theyre okay

ALIKE
Okay

MRS ALVARADO

Theyre lovely Of course your
descriptiveness and use of
alliteration is beautiful and all
you know that ButI dont know
Is it your best No

Alike frowns through the pages of the composition book

ALIKE
I thought it was good

MRS ALVARADO
Its good Not great

Alike slumps back into her seat and considers the books
cover

MRS ALVARADO
I believe you can go deeper

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON 19

Audrey is a heat-seeking missile whipping through the sparse
hallways of the trauma wing her clipboard and pen in

constant motion NURSES and AIDES scatter in her wake
suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to
avoid her caustic gaze She barks at a cluster of CLERKS chit-
chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to
escape Audrey drills her

AUDREY
Oh so your log is all up to date

CLERK

AUDREY
And youve checked the round for

any calls

CLERK

Well I --

AUDREY
Do you even know which doctors are
on the floor

CLERK

AUDREY
Then I suggest you get busy

The clerk skitters off red-faced and Audrey looks daggers
into her back before storming the break room

INT HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads
toward a table A few lounging AIDES wad up their garbage and
flee the break room Audrey settles down at the table and
pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote pretending not
to be hurt She peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins
reading A big red department store bag sits next to her work
tote The television suspended over the table mumbles
corporate healthcare infomercials MRS SINGLETARY one of
Audreys co-workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag
on the table across from her

MRS SINGLETARY

AUDREY

Audreys steely exterior melts away and suddenly she is all
butterflies and giggles She rifles through the bag and
hoists out a pink ribbed v-neck sweater

MRS SINGLETARY

MRS SINGLETARY

Mrs Singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the
sweater from Audrey

MRS SINGLETARY

tastes I just give her gift cards

Mrs Singletary hands the sweater back to Audrey who smooths
it carefully back into the tissue paper

AUDREY

Three ROWDY CO-WORKERS burst into the room chattering and
finger popping

ROWDY CO-WORKER 1

ROWDY CO-WORKER 2 ROWDY CO-WORKER 3

MRS SINGLETARY

The co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various
parts of the breakroom Audrey shoves the sweater back in the
bag and nestles it between her feet Somebody cranks on a
small radio and a frisky RandB beat invades the air Mrs
Singletary pats Audrey on the arm

MRS SINGLETARY
Let me know how it goes

AUDREY
Oh I will Ill call you when--

ROWDY CO-WORKER 3

tapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page

MRS SINGLETARY

ROWDY CO-WORKER 3 ROWDY CO-WORKER 2

The center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone
at the fringes She collects her shopping bag and looks
around to say goodbye but no one notices her leave

INT ALIKES KITCHEN - EVENING 21

Audrey Sharonda Alike and their father ARTHUR 40-

shooting daggers at anyone who dares to make eye contact

Mika smiles as her eyes travel down Alikes physique Alike
aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt

unnecessarily

her lap fighting hard to keep the grin off her face

Look

MIKA

MIKAS FRIEND

MIKA FAST GIRL 2
Whats up

The girls erupt into titters and they melt into
conversation Alike deflates watching them over the top of

her book

She observes every little moment between the girls

and the boy every wink Another BOY joins the group and they

stroll off down the sidewalk

Alike plucks the headphones out of her ears watching them
leave Mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at
Alike Remnants of Alikes grin return reflexively Mikas
friend jerks her elbow around

MIKAS FRIEND

INT ALIKES BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Alike stares at herself in a floor length bedroom mirror in
her underwear

LAURA
I think it looks natural

A peach-colored dildo dangles stiffly from Alikes waist
The harness bunches her boxers in clumsy tufts Alike
appraises the racially inappropriate apparatus and shoots
Laura a look

LAURA
Im serious I mean it doesnt look

Alike is bobbing her head backpack forgotten on her
shoulder Bina cranks the volume down

ALIKE
Yo this shit is hot

ALIKE
Nah I wanna stay

Alike slings her backpack to the floor and pulls the CD book
into her lap Her cell phone rings and she ignores it

EXT THE PIERS - LATER 46

The pier is a parade of mohawks curly weaves tight jeans
and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes young queens and
gender queer youth of all shades of brown stroll cavort and
strut seeing and wanting to be seen Equally bedecked
observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both
sides Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone Competing
threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled
bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her

ALIKE (VO)

Leave a message and Ill call you
back BEEP

Laura yanks her phone away from her ear and looks at the
screen She starts to hang up but pulls it back to her ear

LAURA

INT BINAS BEDROOM - LATER 47

Alike and Bina are sprawled in the floor Bina DJs from her
laptop

BINA
Oh hell no Thats for old people--

ALIKE

EXT THE PIERS - SAME TIME INTERCUT 48

Laura scowls at her cell phone screen She shoves the phone
in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of
the evening Brake lights bathe Laura and her circle of AGs
in red as late-night predators cruise the strip for fresh
meat Laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an
alley across the street and looks away One of the entourage
passes Laura a joint and she inhales deeply A few of the
girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break
off and scatter into the night one by one

PIER GIRL 1
“Member when we used to stay out
here all night

PIER GIRL 2
Shit used to
PIER GIRL 1
You stay with your sister now huh

Laura nods and spits

PIER GIRL 2
Lucky as hell

INT AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

AP English class is a safe haven The desks are pulled
together in a rough circle and are filled with heavily
pierced dyed hair and vintage clothes types Mrs Alvarado
sits cross-legged atop her desk taking notes Alike stands at
the center of the circle reciting an original poem

ALIKE
A butterfly briefly
Suffocated
On the mucous of its own change
Imprisoned
(MORE)

By the membranous chaff of its own
underdeveloped

Wings

And

Cramped

In the darkness of the too-tight
cocoon of its own creation

Pauses

Thinking death inevitable

Prepares to die in the absolute
solitude

Of Swollen Husk

Ac rack appears

A thin jagged light connecting

The inner to the outer world

A butterfly briefly

Paralyzed by the imminence of death
Discovers life is possible

The class claps
MRS ALVARADO

Comments Critiques Julie tell me
what you think
A forest of hands go up as Alike winds her way back to her
seat A few classmates whisper brief encouragements Bina
nods and smiles at Alike Unguarded Alike smiles back

50 EXT STREET - DAY

Bina and Alike troop home at a more leisurely pace Alike
breaks the silence for once

ALIKE

BINA (CONTD)
You wanna come up

51 INT BINAS BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 51

Alike sits on Binas twin bed looking around and really
taking in the room for the first time She reaches over and
picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf
Bina fishes around in a rack of CDs

ALIKE
Who gave you this

BINA
What the bear My dad

ALIKE
No this

Alike holds the figurine out Bina looks at it over her
shoulder

BINA
Oh that Girl my stupid ex-
boyfriend gave me that

ALIKE
Oh Cute

Bina opens a CD case and pulls the booklet out

BINA
Not really I mean I guess it was
at the time

Bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the
room and hands Alike the booklet

BINA (CONTD)
Anyway this is the other artist I
was telling you about Her stuff is
like bouncier
A buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom Bina plops
down on the bed next to Alike

ALIKE
This is straight Youll burn me a
copy
BINA
Yeah I have a bunch of other
stuff too
(beat)

So who do you hang out with I
dont really see you with anybody

Alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack She pulls out
her composition book Awkward silence

BINA (CONTD)
I didnt mean it like that I was
just asking because I was curious
I dont really like anybody that
goes there either

ALIKE
My friend Laura used to go there
Not now but shes going back

BINA
Oh because I was just gonna say--

Bina waves her hand at the radio

BINA (CONTD)
They play this kind of music

ALIKE

Sure Howm I supposed to dress

BINA
You dont dress You just come
however Come as you are

Alike nods

BINA (CONTD)

Bina snatches the book from Alikes hands and starts flipping
through pages before Alike can answer

ALIKE
YeahBut thats mainly old stuff
though

BINA

This is the one you did today

ALIKE
Yeah

BINA
Nice

Bina offers the journal back to Alike Alike reaches for it
Bina pulls it away at the last second--an impromptu game of
keep away

BINA (CONTD)
Take it

Alike misses again The girls crack up

BINA (CONTD)
Sorry here

Bina yanks it away again Alike gives up still smiling

ALIKE
You play too much

BINA
Seriously its right here Just
take it

Alike summons the courage for one last swipe She manages to
grab it but Bina doesnt let go right away The girls lock
eyes during the extemporaneous tug-of-war

ALIKE
Thank you

BINA
Youre welcome

Beaming with her victory Alike busies herself with the
journal Bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next
foray She dances the moose up Alikes arm and plants an

exaggerated peck on her cheek with it

BINA (CONTD)
Mmmwaahhh

The girls erupt into renewed giggles Bina tosses the stuffed
animal aside and scoots closer to read over Alikes shoulder

BINA (CONTD)
Whats so private

ALIKE
Nothin just my writings

Bina studies Alikes profile She leans in and pecks Alike on
the cheek Alike lets the kiss soak in glancing at Bina
sidelong Bina leans in again this time planting a long kiss
on Alikes lips Alike pulls away Bina tenses for the
verdict

ALIKE (CONTD)
Whyd you do that for

BINA
Sorry---

ALIKE
No Im sorry I just ummI gotta

BINA
I thought--

ALIKE
Sorry

Alike blindly grabs up her things and rushes the door Bina
flounders in her wake

INT LAURAS LIVING ROOM - EVENING 52

Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades A
cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Lauras neck like a
PERSONAL CHEERLEADER Music blasts from the TV but doesnt
drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage
There is a knock at the door

LAURA
Youll get that for me
One of the friends breaks away from the pack opens the door
without greeting and walks away Alike is left alone to
escort herself in Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at
the fringes of the pack

ALIKE
Wassup man

A collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table
although no one addresses Alike directly Laura slams the
table and raises her hands in triumph

LAURA
Board goddammit I told you

PIER GIRL 1

Laura slaps hands with her partner The unlucky pair of

LAURA

Yo Im busy right now

More raucous laughter from the table Alike endures another
few moments of card slapping table pounding dejection before
leaning into Lauras ear

ALIKE
I really need to talk to you--

LAURA
I said later

Wide-eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table
Laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up
Alike picks up her face and slips away

PIER GIRL 3
Thought that was your girl

LAURA
Mind your business Bam Thats
what I thought

Laura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig
of water

INT ALIKES PARENTS BEDROOM - NIGHT 53

sliver of light underneath the bedroom door the sound of
Arthurs key in the door breaks the silence Arthurs voice
in hushed tones Audrey rolls over and faces the wall

foil covered plate with a little pink sticky note waits

ARTHUR

Arthur crumples the sticky note and tosses it into the trash
without reading it He peels up one side of the foil peeks

at the food underneath and launches it into the trash too

ALIKE (CONTD)
Dad the plate--dont trash the
plate

Arthur strips off his dress shirt and tie and flings them
into the living room

Alike plays along swallowing her disappointment

uniform out the hall closet He lays it across the back of
the couch and unzips his pants Alike turns her back to give
him privacy

Laura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase
as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch The pier

couch

book now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her

answers into a spiral notebook A stack of old Math and
English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is
peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil

into the store

Arthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock
whispering to one of the men

Arthur follows the mens gazes over to Alike at the potato
chip rack She twirls the string of her basketball shorts
round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t-
shirt up over her nose The smile evaporates from Arthurs
face

Sock peers back at him smirking Arthur starts toward him
when Alike saunters out between them

ARTHUR
We better get going

MACK (CONTD)

Arthur crosses the lot in a bound snatches the car keys from

Alikes hand and hustles her into the car

Audrey reclines on the couch reading a book The doorknob
jiggles and Audrey folds the book against her chest
pretending to be asleep

Arthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair not even
bothering to approach Audreys sleeping form

Arthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of Audreys
foil covered plates He tosses it aside and gathers sandwich
ingredients instead Audrey yawns and props herself up on one
elbow

AUDREY
Oh youre home

ARTHUR

sports highlights Mom scoots over on the couch

INT HOUSE PARTYPOETRY SLAM - NIGHT 63

A MOHAWKED WOMAN yowls into a microphone atop a coffee table
turned stage Kids roam from room to room nursing plastic
cups Some in elaborate ensembles some in thrift store duds
others in plain old jeans but no two people the same Alike
clad in simple shirt and jeans looks especially comfortable
as she and Bina ease their way through the crowd In between
performers guitar riffs rock the large loft apartment and
render their voices practically inaudible

MONTAGE

--Bina introduces Alike to different people Alike is
welcomed

--Alike and Bina point out different performers they laugh and
talk in each others ears

--Alike and Bina dance wildly in the middle of the crowd
surrounded by dozens of other clamorous bodies

--One performer beckons Alike up onto the table Alike demurs
at first then leaps on top of the table Bina cheers

--Alike drags a giggling Bina out of the party and they crash
into the open night

EXT THE PIERS - NIGHT 64

Lights glisten across the Hudson River--distant orbs
reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak
defiance against the night sky A sodium vapor glow veils
everything in generous haloes making the night more
beautiful than it really is

Dancing silhouettes laughing playing yelling flying
always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with
clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house Like Puck on a
midsummers night like Peter Pan and his lost boys Among
the silhouettes is Laura enthroned atop a railing Laura
smoking a joint grandly surrounded by an adoring circle a
sycophantic harem of four

Laura completely miserable as she watches two other
silhouettes drawing closer spinning collapsing now
righting always connected Alike and Bina Bina smiles and
snakes her arms around Alikes neck Alike too shy to react
giggles and folds Laura watches the pair spin and passes to
the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows

EXT THE PIERS- CONTINUOUS 65

Laura cuffs Alike on the neck pulling Alikes hoodie up over
her face Alikes laugh is tentative at first not sure
whether this is play or for real Laura chuckles breaking
the ice The pair slapbox and rough house both missing with
wild arcing blows Laura aims a mini charge at Alike that
lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance
away Alike swipes Lauras hat Laura claps Alike on the
shoulder and Alike waves to Bina Bina waves and smiles

ALIKE
So whatchu you think Shes cool
right

Laura looks around and shrugs Laura plucks a fresh joint out
of her coat and lights it

ALIKE (CONTD)
Shes hot right I told you It was
so tight Im tellin you you

Laura takes a puff and offers it to Alike

LAURA
This ones just for me and you

Alike waves it off oblivious and intoxicated with the night

ALIKE
And shes smart too She does
poetry you should hear it Its
like its good you know

Laura stops walking and Alike skips ahead still chattering
ALIKE (CONTD)
I was thinking next weekend the

LAURA

Alike snaps out of it

ALIKE (CONTD)
Oh my bad I thought you were

Alike shakes her head Her mouth moves but nothing comes out

LAURA (CONTD)
Because I love you alright And

Alike is stopped cold as the light bulb finally goes off
Laura takes a long drag on the joint Bina and Mika stumble
over giggling Bina hooks Alikes arm Mika kisses Laura on
the neck Laura snaps out of her gaze her familiar smirk
creeping back

MIKA
We goin to get something to eat

LAURA

ALIKE
Listen umm--
Laura pinches out the joint and hands it to Mika who tucks it
away

LAURA
Thats for later Bina nice to

Laura gives Bina a polite hug pounds Alike on the shoulder
and starts to lead Mika away

MIKA ALIKE
Byyeee Hey hold up
Laura pumps a lazy fist in the air in acknowledgement Bina
takes Alikes hand and slowly drags her away Alike keeps
looking back then finally gives up Laura looks back just as
Alike turns around and disappears around the corner

BINA (CONTD)
I like your friends Theyre cool

66 INT BINAS BEDROOM - LATER 66

Music videos play on the TV Alike and Bina lay stretched out
on pillows a plate of brownie crumbs between them Alike
dozes Bina smacks her with a pillow

ALIKE

Alike rubs sleep out of her eyes and props herself up on one
elbow

ALIKE
Any brownies left

BINA

Bina flicks off the TV and stares at Alike

ALIKE

Alike looks away

BINA (CONTD)

Alike leans in and kisses Bina on the lips Bina considers
and takes Alikes chin in her hand and kisses her back Bina
places Alikes hand on her chest Alike lets her hand linger
then traces Binas shoulders

INT LAURAS KITCHEN - MORNING 67

Laura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the
mail She pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it The
return address reads NYS Educational and Testing Services
She flips the envelope over and looks around she rips the
top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope The
top of the slip reads Campbell Laura GED TESTING
RESULTS

EXT BRONX HOME - MORNING 68

Laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a
small wooden frame home The paint is peeling and the flowers
in the window-box are dead A rusted metal mailbox next to
the door overflows with circulars Laura lifts the circulars
out of the box and trashes them She picks up a discarded
fast food bag and tosses it too A dog barks from a
neighboring yard Laura pulls open the screen door and tries
to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main
door but its covered over in aluminum foil More barking
Laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door She
snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward
Laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt LAURAS
MOTHER 54 and no-nonsense opens the door and frowns down at
Laura through the screen

LAURA
Oh

Lauras mother crosses her arms and looks at Laura up and
down

LAURA (CONTD)
Thought you mightve stepped out or
something Howve you been

Lauras mother frowns up and down the block before refocusing
on Laura Laura takes a step closer to the door

LAURA (CONTD)
Me and Candy you know were doing

Lauras mother puts her hand on the doorknob

LAURA (CONTD)
We might even be moving to a bigger

Laura takes another step forward

Lauras mother starts to close the door Laura backs away
LAURA (CONTD)

I dont wanna take too much of your

Laura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and
advances on the screen door again holding it out

LAURA (CONTD)
So I did it I took the test and--

Lauras mother slams the door Laura stands on her tiptoes
and yells at the diamond shaped window

LAURA (CONTD)
I got my GED

The lock on the door snaps into place Renewed barking from
across the street Silence from the door Laura brushes a
fist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the
mailbox

LAURA (CONTD)
But listen I--I gotta go I gotta
get to work but Ima leave it for
you to see It was nice talking to
you

Laura backs off the porch and starts down the walkway She
stops halfway and bounds back onto the porch She yanks the
envelope out of the mailbox and jams it into her pocket
Laura storms off the porch and out of yard never looking
back

69 INT BINAS BEDROOM - MORNING

Alike is asleep on the bed Bina cleans up feverishly
accidentally bumping Alike awake Alike yawns and rolls
over a huge grin spreading across her face as she remembers
her surroundings

ALIKE
Hey

BINA
Hey

Bina bolts to the dresser and crams clothes in

ALIKE
You up already
BINA
Its after one oclock actually

Bina deposits an armful of clothes into the dirty clothes
hamper and then begins making the bed with Alike still in
it Alike pulls Bina down beside her

ALIKE

BINA
Nothins wrong Im just cleaning

ALIKE
Okay then Ill help you

BINA

Bina snatches a pillow from behind Alike and fluffs it

Alike still oblivious grins and traces Binas shoulder

ALIKE
Look um--I just wanted to say that

BINA
Last night we were just playin
around thats all

Bina flinches away from Alikes touch Alike shoots a glance
at the door and drops her voice to a choked whisper

ALIKE
Look We can slow things down
Nobody has to know that were
together

BINA

Together Whoa no

ALIKE
Huh I thought Look if you

happened
Bina moves away and levels her gaze at Alike for the first
time Alike touches Binas elbow Bina flinches away

BINA
Look Im not gay okay This isnt
me--I wasnt--Im not ready for all
this

Alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it
around on the bed Bina recoils and snatches it away
Recognition seeps across Alikes pained face Bina moves away
from the bed and turns her back on Alike

Alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on
She pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a
sweatshirt down over her nightie She flings her backpack
open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering
her things Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an
armful of toiletries dumping them in the bag Bina watches
her arms folded Alike takes one last look around the room
and heads for the door running a sleeve across her face

BINA (CONTD)
Lee

Alike ignores her and launches into the hallway Bina runs

to her bedroom doorway

BINA (CONTD)
Wait-—-Lee

Alike beelines for the front door Bina chases Alike across
the room

BINA (CONTD)
Lee stop please

Alike wipes a sleeve across her swelling eyes and running
nose and turns to face her Bina takes several steps toward

her Alike lets go of the doorhandle her voice cracks

ALIKE

BINA
You promise you wont tell anybody

70 EXT BINAS HOUSESTREET - DAY 70

Alike rages outside weaving blind fury down the sidewalk
She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out
into the street narrowly missing getting hit by a car She
continues her zag to the other sidewalk her pace quickening
She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into
the air She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and
flings them into the street Spinning and thrashing she
wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another
garbage can She circles back and kicks the can over She
hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds
her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of
a subway station

INT ALIKES LIVING ROOM - EVENING 71

Lee bursts into the living room and charges to her bedroom
Audrey who has been waiting in the living room storms in
after her

AUDREY

bangs on the door and jiggles the handle

AUDREY (CONTD)

INT ALIKES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 72

Alike attacks her closet ripping all the girly shirts from
the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan
She plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the
floor She launches a pair of pumps into the wall followed
by a chunky pair of Timberlands Silent sobs rack her body as
she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror She
strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner
Alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before
collapsing onto the bed She writhes against the pillows and
covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist
through her body Blackout

INT ALIKES BEDROOM - LATER 73

Alike jerks awake in her bed a pillow pulled down around her
ears The sound of a muffled argument leaks from her
parentss bedroom The shouting gets louder and Alike sits
upright in her bed as her fathers footsteps boom past her
doorway and into the living room Audreys voice trails him
down the hallway and Alike scrambles into a t-shirt and
shorts

A small light flicks to life and grows larger In its dim
glow Laura spots Alike leaning against a worn couch The
lights become two as Laura hands Alike a candle

ALIKE

Arthur is frozen in the middle of the living room with a
contractor trash bag He stoops and piles the shards of a
broken lamp into the bag one by one Sharonda peeks out at
him from her bedroom door Arthur looks up at her and
Sharonda pushes the door shut

INT ALIKES PARENTS BEDROOM - DAY 719

Audrey sits at the edge of her bed in a housecoat Her hair
is ruffled and flyaway Her ankles are crossed and her hands
are dead birds in her lap Her work clothes are laid out ina
neat line beside her shirt pants socks and shoes on the
floor right underneath The telephone begins to ring but
Audrey does not hear it

INT BINAS BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 80

Bina and a HIGH SCHOOL BOY sit on the floor their backs
propped against the bed books spread on the floor The boy
puts his arm around Bina launching numerous passionate
advances but Bina pushes him away

The clueless boy continues his clumsy attempts Bina stares
out the window completely detached

INT ALIKES KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 81

Audrey still in her housecoat stares into the refrigerator
transfixed by the mountain of foil-covered plates Her eyes
are cried-out buttons Suddenly she remembers to breathe and
her breaths come raggedly tearing out fresh tears She yanks
a foil-covered plate dumps its contents into the trash can
and tosses the plate into the sink She dumps another and
another her composure returning with each plate tossed By
the time she gets to the last one her breathing slows and
returns to normal She disappears into the bedroom and
reappears with the red shopping bag She calmly lifts out the
pink blouse and stuffs it into the garbage She wads up the
shopping bag and stuffs it in too She takes a deep breath
and wipes her sleeve across her nose

AUDREY
Okay

INT ALIKES KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON 82

Arthur Audrey and Sharonda are pegged around the dinner
table Audreys make-up fails to cover the dark circles
beneath her eyes and Arthur has a weeks worth of stubble
There is a jagged hole where Alike usually sits Noticing
the asymmetry Audrey bundles up Alikes place setting and
sweeps it onto the floor Sharonda looks from Audrey to
Arthur then into her plate

AUDREY
You want to say grace

Arthur clears his throat

ARTHUR
Heavenly Father

Audrey thrusts her hands out to Arthur and Sharonda They
each take her hand and Arthur begins again

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Dear Heavenly Father we pray we
pray thank you for this food and we
pray we pray for your continued
blessing

Arthur stops talking but his head remains bowed An awkward
silence ensues Audrey and Sharonda look up at him still
holding hands

AUDREY
Amen

ARTHUR
Amen

Audrey switches to an overly cheery auto-pilot mode babbling
to no one in particular

AUDREY
I got this recipe from a magazine
Supposed to be very good And you
see I made those green beans you
like Sharonda pass the rice

Sharonda staring at her father doesnt reach for the bowl
SHARONDA

Dad You know where she is
EXT LAURAS ROOFTOP - WEEKS LATER 83
Alike and Laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart
of mint chocolate chip ice cream Sunset paints the cityscape
pink and orange The faint cadence of children playing drifts
in and out on a fickle breeze Alikes wounds are healing and
she seems happy The friends exchange wordless smiles and
soak in the peacefulness around them

Laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate

Laura swings open the door and Alike looks back in greeting

her smile fading as Arthur appears behind her Laura motions
to Alike Alike considers then carefully nods Laura steps

Alike wanders to the edge of the roof Arthur follows

Distant playground voices fill the pause

ALIKE
Wheres Mom

ARTHUR
Sheyour mother couldnt make it

Alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline
Arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Remember our old place Waaay out
in Queens It was our first
apartment we were so proud Had
all those trees around it In
October the whooole block would be
covered with leaves You remember

Alike makes no sign

ARTHUR (CONTD)
You couldntve been more than 2
years old And when the wind would
blow all those leaves would come
rushing down the street at us and
you thought they were alive Youd
get so scared Youd cry and youd
scream and beg for us to pick you
up I would try and tell you
theyre only leaves baby and
make you stay on the ground But
you were so afraid and you cried so
hard your mother would always pick
you up She always picked you up

Arthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory He dares a
glance over at Alike

ARTHUR (CONTD)

Arthur squeezes Alikes hand and drifts away Alike inhales
the sunset

My Spirit takes flight

Could not have risen otherwise
And I am not Running

Running is not a Choice

From the Breaking

Breaking is freeing

Broken is freedom

I am not broken

I am free

Alike closes her book The pair reflect in easy silence Mrs
Alvarado nods

MRS ALVARADO

INT ARTHURS CAR - DAY 85

The downtown Brooklyn landscape hums against the windshield
as Arthur and Alike ride in complete silence Sharonda chews
a thumbnail peering over the backseat Laura slumps against
the window a smirk hiding at the corner of her lips

EXT REGIONAL BUS STOP - DAY 86
Laura and Sharonda fumble a suitcase out of the trunk of the
car Alike shrugs into her backpack Arthur nudges them aside

and hefts out the rest of the luggage

out of her pocket to wrap both arms around her friend

SHARONDA
Call us when you get there

ALIKE

Laura backs away and wipes a sleeve at her eye

LAURA

Alike disappears through the bus doors Laura slouches on a
hydrant and Sharonda paces scanning the windows for Alike

88 INT BUS - DAY 88
Sharonda waves maniacally Alike musters a smile and puts a
hand on the window Laura raises a fist The bus sails away
from the curb

Alike leans forward to keep Laura and Sharonda in sight as
long as possible As she faces front again she glimpses
Arthur standing in the doorway of the terminal A passing
van blots him from view and she leans back in her seat An
OLD KOREAN WOMAN next to her offers her a piece of ginger
candy Alike pops the candy into her mouth and takes a deep
breath

Reflections of the retreating city landscape replay across
Alikes face and she is able to hold back neither the smile
nor the tears that come

FADE TO BLACK
