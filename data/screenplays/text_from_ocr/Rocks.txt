her face and all around her She laughs like a child We’re
reminded of her age when she laughs And when she cries) gets
ready for school Her room is small Cluttered with
belongings that aren’t hers Plastered with stickers and
pictures Lazy attempts at putting her personal touch on the
decor

INT OMOTOSA FLAT- KITCHEN - MORNING 3

A narrow kitchen Linoleum floor Counter tops filled with
appliances letters and other things intended to be gotten
back to at some point long passed A radio plays EMMANUEL

Big day That’s all

Funke’s energy is high Emmanuel feeds off of it They talk
about school about the trips coming up Emmanuel wants Funke
to take time off to be a parent chaperone for their zoo trip
Funke doesn’t confirm that she will but her positive energy
is enough for the young child

They all sit Rocks’ suspicion has not been allayed

ROCKS
You sure you’re alright mum

Funke squeezes Rocks’ hand Offers a reassuring smile that
doesn’t reassure

Emmanuel picks up the spoon Dishes himself a mountain of
yam

FUNKE
That’s enough you two Come on

EMMANUEL
Should we say the Lord’s prayer cos
were eating yams

Funke and Rocks laugh Emmanuel waits for them with hands
clasped and one eye closed like a school nun Funke and
Rocks quickly heed his warning swallowing their laughter
they close their eyes and bow their heads

EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
Our father he’s up in heaven long
be thy name thy kingdom come I
won’t be done in earth as is
heaven give us our stay our daily
bread and give us our trespasses
