THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY

FADE IN
BLACK SCREEN

And in the darkness a TICKING sound is heard Soft and
steady -- soothing -- and then a BANG

SMASH UP ON

INT HOSPITAL - BASEMENT NURSES STATION - NIGHT
A HAND punching a CARD into the huge ticking TIME CLOCK on
the wall 700 am

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - A bleary-eyed MALE NURSE beginning
his day Alone inside a small wood and glass cubicle he
rips off yesterdays day-at-a-time calendar page revealing
todays date October 11 1931

Goes to the Victrola inside the cubicle Cranks the turntable
up to speed Puts the huge needle down on a spinning 78 we
hear the song crackling through the empty halls of the
hospital -- depression-era Muzak Horace Heidt and His Musical
Knights Keep Your Sunny Side Up

The Nurse sharpens the last of a half-dozen pencils to needle-
points sits down at his desk and begins the tedium of
jotting entries into a tall stack of Patient Records

Beat And then he hears a soft almost paw-like tapping on
the glass He looks up a PATIENT with a heavily bandaged
head is standing there his eyes as dull and lifeless as
marbles

The Nurse waves the Patient away Goes back to his work
Beat And then the tapping is heard again The Nurse snaps
his head up about to bark at the man -- but the words stop
dead on his tongue

Standing on the other side of the glass are now two dozen
patients Likewise bandaged staring silent and dead-eyed at
him

Unnerved the Nurses finger slowly stretches towards a
buzzer-button just below the desk-top It never makes it
Because --

A HAND - lashes into frame and grabs the Nurses fingers The
Nurse looks up

In addition to the mass of Patients outside the cubicle
there are now six of them inside it surrounding him The
Nurses eyes shoot to the still-locked doors of the cubicle
and he utters one confused word --

MALE NURSE
-- how --

-- and then someone rams all six of his needle-sharp pencils
eraser-deep into his throat

The Nurse gurgles and staggers -- falls back against the
Victrola hitting the turntable crank as he goes down
causing it to start spinning like a pinwheel

Keep Your Sunny Side Up now blares through the halls triple-
time sounding like a thousand manic chipmunks And to the
beat of that tune the Patients smash the CONTROL PANEL
inside the cubicle until it shorts-out and explodes Which
pops open

INT PATIENT CELLS -

- and sends dozens more wild raving Humans rampaging through
the hospital while EVERY ELECTRIC LIGHT in the place strobes
maniacally and ORDERLIES and OTHER NURSES are chased down like
rabbits by Patients and beaten to pulp and

INT THERAPY ROOMS -

- filled with devices that look straight out of the Spanish
Inquisition are trashed to toothpicks and some of the STAFF
are forced into devices and tortured as PATIENT RECORDS are
spindled and ignited -- flaming torches used to set
everything in the place ablaze and A WOLFPACK OF PATIENTS
kamikaze down-

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

-- fling open a set of double doors marked Cerebral
Hygiene shouting Vannacutt And we see --

INT CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- two people in surgical scrubs the moustached Doctor
named VANNACUTT and a FEMALE NURSE wielding a 16mm camera As
the two whip around startled by the shouts we see the
object of their ministrations A PATIENT on a gurney being
filmed as his internal organs are slowly and methodically
extracted -- while still alive

And then all hell breaks loose as the WOLF PACK descends

DR VANNACUTT manages to yank down a LEVER on the wall
labeled Lockdown before hes swallowed by the Mob

From somewhere in the house we hear heavy gear cables and
doors loudly shutting down the house

The NURSE is clubbed to the floor with her own camera And
amidst all the vengeful shouts and wails a curious thing
happens

As one of the Patients picks up the Nurses blood-spattered
camera and puts it to his eye the image on screen abruptly

SMASHES TO
INT CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM - - GRAINY BLACK and WHITE
-- and dead silence -- and we find ourselves watching old
soundless 16mm footage of what happened next a blur of

scalpels and saws as the Patients viciously vivisect
Vannacutt and Nurse whove been crammed together on that
same gurney The BandW CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT on Vannacutts
screaming maw -- and suddenly we hear SOUND AGAIN --

-- but for some reason its not a human cry but the
CROWING OF A ROOSTER -- and when we PULL BACK OUT we see that
what were now watching is the Crowing Rooster and four
blazing camera lenses that was the logo of the old PATHE
NEWSREEL The stentorian VOICE OF PATHE booms OVER

VOICE OF PATHE
October 11 1931 Los Angeles

Dithering Bernard Herrmann-like strings swell up

CUT TO (BandW)
A PATHE NEWS HEADLINE CARD HOSPITAL OF HORROR

CUT TO (BandW)
EXT THE HOUSE - NIGHT - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE

A WHIPLASH PAN from the ocean to a GRANITE BUILDING high atop
the Pacific Palisades Smoke and flames shoot from every
window and door as Firemen look on helplessly

VOICE OF PATHE
A conflagration of Biblical
proportions incinerates nearly
everything and every one inside
what was once Tinsel Towns most
celebrated psychiatric facility
The Vannacutt Neuropathic
Institute But the secret this
inferno burned free was far more
frightening than any picture that
Hollywood could ever produce

CUT TO (BandW)
EXT THE HOUSE - MORNING - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE

LA Sheriffs and Coroners Investigators poking through the
Institute

INT THE HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - MORNING - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE
QUICK CUTS OF GRUESOME IMAGES

-- BODIES manacled to walls rows of SKULLS riddled with
drill-holes a huge VAT filled with blood

VOICE OF PATHE
-- a Sanitarium of Slaughter supervised

by a surgeon gone mad --

CUT TO (BandW)
ECU -- a formal PHOTOGRAPH of the man himself mustache
waxed eyes intense as a mesmerists seeming to stare a hole
right through us --

VOICE OF PATHE
-- Richard Benjamin Vannacutt --

and --
INT LIMBO SET -

-- suddenly stepping right through VANNACUTTS FACE and
strolling solemnly towards us in bright video-taped color is

CHRISTOPHER LEE He addresses the CAMERA

CHRISTOPHER LEE
-- murdered by his own patients before
every one of them perished in the
blaze Ironically the only humans
to escape the conflagration --

-- behind him we see SILENT NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of five
people

EXT THE HOUSE - MORNING (CHYRON INERT)

-- three ORDERLIES two NURSES -- clothes and faces sooty
and singed each coughing up a storm as theyre treated at
the scene --

CHRISTOPHER LEE
-- were five of Vannacutts equally
sadistic Staff all of whom until the
day they died insisting that they were
only following Doctors Orders

BACK TO SCENE
The SCREEN behind him goes black

CHRISTOPHER LEE
But our story doesnt end there For
some years later the gutted interior
of the Institute was refurbished as a
private residence It has yet to be
inhabited Many say because the spirits
of the vile Vannacutt and his Victims
still walk the long corridors inside
this place now known simply as The
House On Haunted Hill

A sudden SMASH of shrill discordant HORNS scares us out of
our skin -- and behind Mr Lee an IMAGE is seen again

EXT THE HOUSE - NIGHT (TO BE SHOT AS PART OF A LATER SCENE)
-high atop a bluff swaddled in shadows cast by a full moon
that seems to have one of Vannacutts eyes piercing down on
it

INT ROLLS ROYCE LIMOUSINE - TRAVELING - DAY

CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM A SMALL WALNUT SHROUDED TELEVISION
SET revealing a savagely beautiful young woman EVELYN
STOCKARD-PRICE sitting like the queen of fucking-England in
the back of her limousine Shes been watching all this on
the 12 TV set inside the limousine a look of perverse
amusement on her face

ON THE TV Mr Lee smiles for the CAMERA

CHRISTOPHER LEE
Im Christopher Lee More of
Terrifying But True in just a
moment --

EVELYN
No need baby

She zaps the TV dead with a button on the armrest

EVELYN
You just gave me exactly what I needed

She reaches for the phone
EXT AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

A beeping CELL PHONE is retrieved from a coat pocket punched
to life and brought up to the lips of

STEVEN PRICE - a 30ish bespectacled man

While not handsome in the classical sense he still exudes an
incredible appeal -- the kind that comes from incredible self-
confidence more money than God and the most maniacal
imagination in recorded history

PRICE
(into phone)
Price
(listens sarcastic)
Evelyn how nice
(beat listens)

Well that is fascinating -- but Im
gonna have to get back to you -- theyre

trying to shoot me here

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Price buttoning the phone dead as a
NEWS CREW of two videotapes him an ENG Cameraman named
BENNY and a 20-something Katie Couric wannabe with a
microphone in Prices face -- KIRSTEN SAVAGE

Theyre all standing amidst a sprawling landscape of
futuristic-looking buildings and rides a spanking new theme
park We see the great steel arch that bears the places
name

TERROR-INCOGNITA
A New Adventure From Steven Price

KIRSTEN
Business or pleasure Mr Price

PRICE
My wife Where were we

KIRSTEN
Your roller coaster that is quote
unlike any that has ever come before
it

PRICE
Absolutely No cheap thrills A genuine
Journey To The Brink Of Madness

He gestures grandly towards the huge and extremely tall
expanse of steel girders and tracks in front of them

KIRSTEN
Sorry but it just looks like a generic
roller coaster to me Whats the
gimmick

Price beckons them to an elevator at the base of the ride
PRICE
Ever seen one that starts at the

top 20 stories worth of top

KIRSTEN
And then what happens

PRICE
(smiles)
I think its something better
experienced then described

The Elevator door whooshes open He bids them enter

PRICE
After you

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The DOORS CLOSE and the elevator starts up Through small
ports in the sides they see the beams of the roller coasters
superstructure dropping down past them as the cabin rises

KIRSTEN
Sources have told this reporter that the
real reason your Parks opening has been
delayed was a near-fatal accident on one
of the rides here Comment

PRICE
I wouldnt be opening this place
tomorrow if every single thing down to
the beheaded Beanie Babies hadnt tested
100 safe

-- hes cut off by a loud GROANING sound like metal under
stress

BENNY
What the hell was that

PRICE
(all confidence)
Growing pains new steels gotta bend
and stretch a little before finally
settling in

Another GROAN A yelp escapes from Kirstens mouth
PRICE

Dont worry In the fifteen year history

of Price Amusements weve yet to lose a
single customer

The GROANING stops But Kirsten and Benny remain nervous

KIRSTEN
First time for everything

PRICE
Ive designed and built six of these
places -- take my word for it

everythings fine

BENNY
(nervous)
How long til were out of this thing

PRICE
Five ten seconds were almost to
the top --

-- the elevator LURCHES to a DEAD STOP
Kirsten and Benny look at each other -- anxiety on overdrive

Price tries to reassure them but hes not looking real
relaxed anymore either
PRICE
Look even if God forbid something
unexpectedshould happen theres
always the safety cable --

-- and now the cabin is rocking sharp and nasty spasms that
are buffeting them into each other --

BENNY
-- that does what

PRICE
Keeps the cab from just --

-- he sees something out the window --

PRICE
-- oh shit --
A loud CRACK The cabin starts dropping -- fast All three of

them scream

OUT THE WINDOW we see the SUPERSTRUCTURE of the roller
coaster flying by The sound of cables screeching free of
pulleys

Bennys camera is wrenched from his hands and bounces around
the cabin Kirstens eyes are crazed with terror

KIRSTEN
Do something

PRICE
Like what This isnt supposed
to be happening

The scenery outside the window is a blur

BENNY
OhJesusohChrist

The ground is coming up to meet them the noise inside the
cabin is deafening

Benny starts jumping up and down Kirsten is pounded to the
floor Price braces himself for impact

KIRSTEN
Please Something Oh-God

PRICE
Maybe if I --

With all his strength Price throws himself across the cabin
and stabs an unmarked button on the elevator control panel --
-- the cabin suddenly stabilizes --
-- the elevator door opens --
EXT AMUSEMENT PARK - DEPARTURE DOCK - DAY

-- revealing the cabin to be just where it should be high
atop the roller coaster right across from the dock where the
cars depart They never fell so much as an inch -- all an
illusion

The expression on Prices face has changed to a wicked grin
He looks at the two terrified souls on the elevator floor

PRICE
From here on it gets really scary

A MAN IN OVERALLS (SCHECTER) stands on the dock waves the
News Crew towards a rear car

SCHECTER
Room for two more

The front car is already full with People strapped in so
tight theyre immobile

TIME CUT TO
INT AMUSEMENT PARK - DEPARTURE DOCK - DAY

Price still on the departure dock punching up a number on
his cell phone In the bg we can see the cars containing
Kirsten Benny and the others zooming at incredible speeds
on 45 degree banks upside-down loop-de-loops the works All
with screams of sheer pleasure accompanying

PRICE
(into phone)
Alright Princess now what were
you babbling

He listens for a moment -- then his eyes crimp shut with
disgust

PRICE
(into phone)
Congratulations on a scale of one-to-
ten you just hit a 73 on the Perversity
Meter I dont suppose for once we could
just celebrate at some nice quiet
little restaurant --

Schecter taps Price on the shoulder

SCHECTER
Houston I think we may have a problem
PRICE
(into phone)
Evelyn go stir your cauldron or
something for a sec

Price turns and watches in the distance as the coaster car
takes a screaming hair pin turn

EXT ROLLER COASTER - MOVING - DAY
Kirsten and Benny in the rear car wild with delight --

-- until they see the front car derail snap free from
theirs and go hurtling into mid-air Screams of panic heard
from the People in that car as they plummet to their deaths

Kirsten screams with horror Benny retches as their car
continues to zip along the track and out of our sight

EXT AMUSEMENT PARK - DEPARTURE DOCK - DAY

PRICE
Problem where Looked good to me

SCHECTER
Dummy 6 keeps losing his arm

PRICE
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism
and just make him a screamer

A tentative DOOR-KNOCK heard 0S behind him

WOMANS VOICE (0OS)

He mouses his cursor up to a box marked SEND the list
disappears his hard drive starts chugging and he gets up
from his chair and exits CAMERA remains on the working
screen

Beat And then a SHADOW flashes across the screen for a
moment

Another beat And the sound of clicking computer keys is
heard A message box appears on screen

ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE guestlistdoc
The Cursor clicks on YES ZAP A blank screen And then the
keys start clicking again and we see a new Guest List being
typed in
Starting with the name

Ms Jennifer Jenzen
Executive Vice-President of Marketing
Paragon Pictures

MATCH CUT TO

EXT FILM SET - DAY (WE NEED TO RE-WORK THIS SCENE FOR
LOCATION)

The name Ms Jennifer Jenzen etched in gold-leaf cursive on
the top of a small CHROME AND ONYX-INLAID CUBE

WOMANS VOICE (0OS)
Gorgeous
PULL BACK - and we see MS JENZEN -- a rodent-eyed thin
lipped 30-something Exec who only needs Screaming Bitch
stamped on her forehead to complete the picture Shes
sitting staring at the Cube the elegant paper it came in
torn to shreds on her desk

JENZEN
So what the fuck is it

Shes addressing her assistant a lovely but harried-
looking young Woman of 19 SARA WOLFE

SARA
I dont know Ms Jenzen

JENZEN
Well whos the damn thing from

SARA
(shrugs)
Messenger just dropped it off
No return address

JENZEN
You didnt think to ask

SARA
I was in the middle of --

JENZEN
-- being utterly fucking useless
what else is new

Saras face flushes with anger but she keeps her cool

SARA
Theres something there on the side --

Shes pointing to a small SILVER CRANK jutting out of one of
the Cubes sides A legend is etched beneath it

Rotate Once To Operate

JENZEN
Im aware of that

Well she is now anyway She twists the crank and a tinkling
music box-like TUNE begins to play Lennon McCartneys
Birthday but in 34 time like some schizoid Viennese
waltz

JENZEN
Its not my goddamn birth --

-- and she stops herself in mid-word as suddenly the top
of the Cube pops open like a jack-in-the-box And slowly
like its on some mini-hydraulic lift ANOTHER CUBE
identical to this one starts to inch up into view --

-- which has its own tiny SILVER CRANK in its side But
etched beneath this one is a warning

Do Not Rotate Under Any Circumstances

Without a nanoseconds hesitation Jenzen reaches out her
hand --

SARA
-- I wouldnt --

-- and turns the smaller crank Beat Nothing happens
JENZEN
-- no kidding thats why youre

making ten bucks an hour and Im --

-- and BANG A SKELETAL ARM comes FLASHING OUT from the
smaller cube and SLASHES HER FINGER with a RAZOR

JENZEN
Jesus

-- its no more than a paper cut but its bleeding and it
hurts -- and then they both see written on the tiny razor

Learn To Follow Instructions
Sara cant help herself -- lets loose a little snort of
laughter Jenzen goes ballistic smashes the lid shut on the

Cube

JENZEN
You think this is fucking funny

SARA
No no its just --

JENZEN
-- well heres a better one youre
fired
SARA
What
JENZEN

And heres your goddamn severance
She slams the Cube hard into Saras hands
CUT TO

INT SARAS CUBICLE - JUST AFTER (WE NEED TO RE-WORK THIS
SCENE FOR LOCATION)
The Cube sits in a wastebasket next to the desk that Saras
angrily cleaning out Shes SLAMS her entire blotter into the
trash -- which hits the Cubes crank and starts the music
playing again Sara startled looks over -- and sees

AN ORNATE IVORY-COLORED CARD - begin to ascend from the
Cube It starts with the words

Now Try And Follow These

And then all we see are Saras wide growing-wider eyes as
she reads the rest

SARA
wowWOW Hey Ms Jenzen --

JENZEN (0S)
Are you still fucking here

Sara starts to flush with anger again -- and then stops a
small smile coming to her lips as she continues to stare at
the card

SARA
On my way out Thanks for the
valuable parting gift

She snatches the ivory card and stuffs it in her purse
SMASH TO
INT HEARSE 1 - MOVING - NIGHT

Where Sara Wolfe sits decked out in near-dead-ringers
clothes and hair-do as we last saw on Jennifer Jenzen black
silk suit stiletco heels and an up-sweep -- holding that
same ivory-colored card in her hand

Steven K Price
COMMANDS YOU TO ATTEND
A Very Unique Birthday Celebration For
Mrs Evelyn Stockard-Price

And then the CAMERA WHIPLASH CRANES BACK from Sara and the
vehicle in which shes sitting to reveal the grand vista of

EXT WINDING ROAD - NIGHT

which snakes crazily up the Pacific Palisades the crashing
waves of the ocean seen in the background We see that the
vehicle Sara is riding in is the lead car of a MOTORCADE
comprised of four 50s vintage HEARSES

MANS VOICE (0OS)
The mans insane

And we whip back towards the source of this voice
INT HEARSE 2 - MOVING - NIGHT

where we see this Mans well-tanned hand holding the same
ivory card which continues

Terror Humiliation Perhaps Even
MURDER
Will Be The Entertainment

WOMANS VOICE (0OS)
Dont get much better than that

INT HEARSE 3 - MOVING - NIGHT

where we see the well-manicured hands of this Woman her left
holding an 8mm Camcorder her right the same card

With ONE MILLION DOLLARS Paid
To Those That Survive The Entire Night

YOUNG MANS VOICE (0OS)
Terrific whats the catch

INT HEARSE 4 - MOVING - NIGHT

where we see hands of a Man barely out of his teens his
muscular right hand holding that same card as well

Inside the Walls Of
THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL

Suddenly the screech of brakes is heard -- Hearse 4 jolts to
a halt The invitation flies from the Young Mans hand and to
the floor the rest of its text unread

EXT THE HOUSE - NIGHT

We see the reason for the sudden stop of the cortege An
ancient CHRYSLER K CAR is parked clear across the road
barring the entrance to the gate of a razor-wire security
fence that encircles the premises Beat And then a short
slight MAN steps out of the vehicle In the glare of the
Hearses headlights his features look cadaverous Between
that and the fact hes jittering like a hummingbird on speed
he makes a pretty unsettling presence

The Man walks slowly towards the hearses beckoning the
riders out

MAN (PRITCHETT)
This is the endby car anyway
What with the 94 quake and El Nino
the driveways been pretty much
destroyed Shame Have to hoof it
from here
The well-tanned Man from Hearse 2 steps out DR DONALD W
BLACKBURN -- he could be anywhere from 19 to 90 The only
thing thats clear is all the cosmetic surgery hes had makes
him look like George Hamilton circa 1962 He asks the
obvious

BLACKBURN
If you dont mind me asking Who are
you

PRITCHETT

Names Pritchett Watson Pritchett
I own the house my father built it
And now I just need to get you into
it So

The Camcorder Woman steps out of Hearse 3 a Jenny Jones-
clone named MELISSA MARR 27

MELISSA
Wheres Steven Price and his huge
throbbing checkbook

PRITCHETT
Not with you is he Well Im sure
hell turn up any second now If

youll just come along

The Muscular Young Man from Hearse 4 steps out a good-
looking specimen named EDDIE MOSES 23

EDDIE
I wanna know first to what do I
owe this honor I mean I never
even heard of this guy

PRITCHETT
Im just the Greeter -- and
in that capacity I now urge you
all strongly to --

And then Sara-as-Jenzen regally alights from Hearse 1

SARA
But the million bucks each thats
for real

PRITCHETT
(a forced chuckle)
It better be -- he still owes me
25 grand for renting the place
for the night Here lets get
you some illumination so you
can make your way safely

He grabs a flashlight from his car and shoves it in Saras
hand
PRITCHETT
Just point and walk sis -- the
place is right up --

-- and as if on cue a battery of magnesium floods suddenly
light up the night like high noon revealing the House in all
its glory

PRITCHETT
(startled)
there

Sitting high atop a bluff over the Pacific a sprawling
grey-stone structure One-third Eames to one-third Wright
to one-third Bauhaus

It might look innocuous in the daylight but right now it
looks like Albert Speers Playhouse And underscoring the
creepy ambience is MUSIC now blaring from speakers perched
atop the gate Marilyn Mansons screeching Goth-metal cover
of Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These)

BLACKBURN
Nice touch Pritchett subtle

EDDIE
As a tumor

PRITCHETT
Wish I could take the credit but --

SARA
-- guess we know where Mr Price is
now

PRITCHETT
He mustve beaten us all here

EDDIE
Less the place really is haunted

PRITCHETT
Nonsense Just bad press All the
deaths that occurred inside --
my own fathers included -- all
perfectly normal fatal accidents

MELISSA
You better be wrong I didnt
come all this way for normal

She starts making her way up the disaster of a driveway Dr
Blackburn and Sara look at each other and shrug

They start likewise walking towards the house The only one
left is Eddie He stares at the little man
EDDIE
Youre totally full of shit arent you

PRITCHETT
(brightly)
Youll never know til you walk
through that door

Eddie dismisses him with a flap of his hand and sprints to
catch up with the others Pritchett yells after him

PRITCHETT
You wouldnt consider getting my check
and running it back down here

No response Beat Pritchett gets out of his car

PRITCHETT
Didnt think so Asshole

He starts jittering his way up the drive
INT GRAND FOYER - SOON AFTER

Cold Flinty Two stories high and domed with a stained
glass skylight topping it Despite their varied states of
confusion the four Guests stop in their tracks as they
enter struck dumb with awe

EDDIE
desus H Christ

MELISSA
So wheres the party

SARA
Looks like were it

BLACKBURN
More to the point Wheres our host

MELISSA
More to the point what in the
name of fuck is that

Shes pointing up at the stained glass skylight It seems to
depict a Man with dozens of hideous creatures hovering round
his head And above them all looms a huge something with
wings and flaming claws

BLACKBURN
More of Prices spook-house bullshit

PRITCHETT (0OS)
Not at all
They turn to see Pritchetts head poking through the doorway
-- putting as little of himself as possible inside the house
proper

PRITCHETT
Part of the original structure When it
was still an asylum Guy who ran the
place -- Dr Vannacutt -- found it
inspirational From some German
cathedral a million years ago Driving
the Demons From the Mind

BLACKBURN
Im moved beyond words

MELISSA
The hint of still weirder shit
to come I can only hope

She whips the Camcorder to her eye and starts recording every
detail of the skylight Dr Blackburn rolls his eyes
Pritchett starts calling loudly

PRITCHETT
Mr Price Mrs Price Somebody Hello

BLACKBURN
Pritchett take it down a couple
hundred decibels what is your

problem

PRITCHETT
Problem No problem -- just want to get
my money and get on home -- you know

things to see people to do
He laughs weakly starts shouting again

PRITCHETT
Mr Price Mrs Price

Melissa Marr continues to shoot up a storm of tape in the
room as overexcited as a five-year-old whos lost her
Ritalin

MELISSA
I knew this whole placed be pure gold
Pritchett point me in the direction of
the goddamn ghosts If I can get
something bizarre enough on tape I
think I can parlay it into getting me
some kinda Robert Stack Unsolved Most-
Wacked-Out Home Videos gig No more
five afternoons a week of sex-change-
Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-em

EDDIE
Youve got your own TV show

MELISSA
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV
show All Ive got is a blow-dryer anda

Saras staring at something thats making her more nervous by
the second

SARA
Uh excuse me -- but does anybody know
any logical reason why those little
demons would be moving

Shes pointing to the skylight

MELISSA
Where

She whips her camera up at the stained glass Zooms in Tense
beat And then lowers the camera sighing in disappointment

MELISSA
birds Just seagulls or something
walking on the glass goddammit

EDDIE
Cheer up before the nights through
Im sure one of usll get hacked to
pieces by somebody or something

VOICE (0OS)
I may start right now

All heads turn again -- standing in the open front doorway
dressed absolutely to kill is a not-terribly-pleased-looking
EVELYN STOCKARD-PRICE

EVELYN
Who the fuck are all of you

-- and right on that beat the huge dome of STAINED GLASS
above them all EXPLODES

All heads whip up -- as time seems to stand still -- and it
begins raining COLORED SHARDS in the foyer

MELISSA
OhmyGod

IN SLOW MOTION -- We see the rest of the Guests
instinctively start to duck and cover against the deluge --
all except EVELYN whos staring up at the descending
projectiles with a profound look of annoyance on her face

EDDIE - notices that a huge DEMON-HEADED GLASS SHARD is
hurtling razor-point-down for Evelyns head With an
athletes reflexes he hurls his body at hers --

EDDIE
-- Jesus lady --

-- tackling her to the floor the giant SHARD missing her
skull by literally a hair It plunges six inches deep into
the parquet THWANGS like an arrow into a target

Beat of absolute sheer STUNNED SILENCE And then

MELISSA
Wow

Everyone else stares at Evelyn whos not moving

SARA
Is shealright

EDDIE
I thought she was dead For sure

EVELYN
Not even fucking close
(seething to Eddie)
Getoffofme

Its like being spit at by a cobra Eddie doesnt have to be
told twice Leaps off her and Evelyn slowly angrily gets to
her feet a trickle of blood coming down her cheek from a
small cut there A VOICE is heard from somewhere OS

VOICE (0OS)
Not dead now but soon

All eyes look up to see STEVEN PRICE perched on the balcony
rail above them in formal wear legs crossed cigar in hand
blowing out smoke through highly bemused lips

PRICE
Shes been marked for it The House does
that Happened to Pritchetts father
Likely happen to you all Isnt that

PRITCHETT
(looking away)

I cant remember at the moment

Blackburn applies his handkerchief to Evelyns bleeding
cheek She recoils

EVELYN
Dont touch me

PRICE
Im impressed I dont think Evelyns
ever said those words to anything with
genitalia

EVELYN
Im not laughing Steven

PRICE
You shouldnt be -- you were nearly just

(to the guests)
And now that our birthday girl is
finally here let the games begin

EVELYN

Price just smiles

She glares back at him steaming

EVELYN
Could we have a word

PRICE
Oh I think were going to have several

Evelyn doesnt have to be invited shes already stomping
halfway up the stairs Price smiles down at the Guests

PRICE
Thisll just take a moment -- youll
find food and booze in the main salon

Evelyn grabs him hard by the arm and yanks him back into the
shadows they disappear from sight The Guests just stand
there

EDDIE

Price did that

MELISSA
I hope not
SARA
Of course he did for Gods sake
(beat)

Didnt he Mr Pritchett

PRITCHETT
I cant comment until I get paid
BLACKBURN
Im surrounded by idiots

Blackburn walks off into the Main Salon near the Foyer The
others shrug and follow him except for Pritchett who shouts

upstairs

PRITCHETT
Mr Price

No response from anyone Pritchetts eyes jitterbug all

around him -- he sees hes standing there alone As
nonchalantly as he can he quick -- steps towards the Salon
and the others -- passing right by a barely perceptible

black dot in the wall no larger than a dime --
TRAVELING THROUGH WALLS
-- and we PUSH IN on this DOT until were inside it on

the OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL and see thats its connected to a
COAXIAL CABLE which we FOLLOW past ancient decaying beams

and mortar past VERMIN -- rodent and insect both -- that
skitter maniacally right in our faces -- and then right
into the innards of the multi-wired CABLE itself -- emerging

out near
A VIDEO MONITOR

-- thats atop a table with several other monitors and a
literal Circuit Citys worth of electronic and computer
equipment all of it inside a --

INT SMALL GRIMY ROOM

-- in which sits Steven Prices engineer SCHECTER in his
coveralls eating a sandwich as he mans Haunted House
Central Control He hits a combination of keys on the
computer On one of the Monitors we see a door somewhere
inside the House rapidly open-and-shut open-and-shut

Nods with satisfaction then YELPS as he spots a MILLIPEDE
wriggling out of his tuna salad straight into his mouth

SCHECTER
Jesus

He flicks the insect away nearly gagging It lands on
another VIDEO MONITOR that is trained on a room on the upper
floor of the place Some space that looks like it was going
to be a bedroom once upon a time a lot of strange ultra-
modern furniture all of it metal and of bizarre angles and
shapes And then into that room storms Evelyn and Price

PUSH IN on that video screen and suddenly were there

INT EVELYNS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
As Evelyn slams the door behind her

EVELYN

pages long -- where the hell are they

PRICE
-- just not always in the sexual sense

EVELYN

thumbnail He lets her go and sucks on a knuckle -- shes
drawn blood

places you just touched me and then Im

She storms into the bathroom adjoining and slams that door
CUT TO

INT MAIN SALON - JUST AFTER

Just off the foyer The furniture though dust-caked and

rotting is antique Deco and sumptuous Liquor and a lavish

buffet have been set out on a sideboard that looks like one

of Dalis limp pocket-watches As Price enters the room

grimly hes descended upon by an angry Pritchett

PRITCHETT

agreed on your guests are all here and

MACHINES at work Pritchett freezes for a moment

PRITCHETT
Oh no

SARA

Heavy rusted GEARS somewhere in the house CRUNCHING as
they begin to turn

The NOISE inside the room inside the entire house is
deafening Price senses something

slamming into place

CUT TO

BAM The front door being likewise sealed by a descending
IRON PLATE -- nearly decapitating Pritchett

PRITCHETT
You cant do this to me

INT VARIOUS LOCATIONS (NOTE TBA)

BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM Every window door and portal of
any kind in the house likewise being slammed-sealed shut

CUT TO
INT MAIN SALON

little afraid as the sound of SLAMMING IRON is heard echoing
everywhere in the distance

Pritchett making a literal last dive for the one window in
the foyer that is still partially unsealed its iron plate

closing fast --

PRITCHETT
-- NOOOOO0OO --

concrete floor mission completed

CUT TO
INT MAIN SALON
That final BAM resounding in the Main Salon And then
silence
MELISSA

Eddie Moses tries to yank up one of the plates -- all he gets

for his efforts is two handfuls of rust

EDDIE
This things going nowhere

BLACKBURN
If this is someones idea of a

Foyer --

PRICE
-- Pritchetts not laughing

CUT TO

Price and Guests entering and greeted by the sight of
Watson Pritchett - Hair wild clothes torn SCREAMING as he
tries to pry the cast-iron plate off the Foyer window with

his bare hands --

handkerchief and puts it on Pritchetts wounds Pritchett

Pritchett looks up at him eyes not quite focused

PRITCHETT
Lockdown

Sara dashes back in with the bottle of vodka

SARA
What does that mean

Blackburn takes the liquor and begins cleaningdisinfecting
Pritchetts wounds

PRITCHETT

A mechanism From the old Asylum For
Emergencies Sealed the whole place
shut Top to bottom Thats how come
they all burned to death in 31 Dr
Vannacutt threw the switch If he was
gonna die they all were gonna die
and so they were toast

MELISSA
No wonder theyre still pissed off

PRITCHETT
The only ones who survived were five of
Vannacutts staff butchers

BLACKBURN
Why in Gods name wasnt this thing
removed years ago

PRITCHETT
It was on my Dads list of things
to do But the House did him first

EDDIE
You said that was an accident

PRITCHETT
I lied The House is alive and
were all gonna die

BLACKBURN
Oh for chrissake --

SARA
-- uh excuse me just one quick
question How long before this damn
thing unseals itself

PRITCHETT
Dont know that it does

SARA
Well then how bout maybe we
call someone

PRITCHETT
Hasnt been a telephone in this
House in over 60 years

Blackburn Price and Melissa Marr all chime in unintentional
unison

BLACKBURNPRICEMELISSA
Ive got my cellular

SARA
Well flip a coin and somebody dial 911

PRITCHETT
Wont do any good

SARA
Why not

And then simultaneously we hear the same beep-beep-beep
from the three cellular phones and see the same flashing
message on their LED screens No Service - No Service - No
Service

PRICE
Must be those plates -- interfering

with the signal somehow

PRITCHETT
She starts

Heads turn

Not the plates the House Why is no one
listening to me Its alive And once
its made up its mind it wont let
anything out

EDDIE
So what Youre saying were stuck

PRITCHETT
A cleaning crews supposed to arrive

the power of the house fades at dawn

EDDIE
-- well lets hear it for small
miracles --

PRITCHETT
-- but I imagine well all be mutilated
beyond recognition by then

MELISSA
Goodbye bad times -- hello Prime Time

PRITCHETT
Believe me we need to

SARA
Pritchett this lockdown thing --
its gotta have like a master control
-- you know machinery gears whatever --
somewhere in this place

PRITCHETT
The basement -- but believe me

SARA
No you dont want to go down there I
am going down there And Im going to
find reverse on this thing and floor it

PRITCHETT
Youll never find it its a maze down
there

SARA

Well that leaves you with two options
then doesnt it either show me where
and maybe we get out of here -- or its
spend-the-night-sleep-tight

Pritchett leaps to his feet
PRITCHETT
Its actually very easy when you
know the way

EVELYN
A word of advice honey God knows what
kind of freak-outs Stevens got set to
spring in this place If I were you Id
bring something to protect yourself
with Baby dont you think nows the
time to I break out your party favors

Price suddenly looks uneasy

PRICE
What are you talking about

EVELYN
Must be getting old Stevie -- youre
repeating yourself -- this is the exact

same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam
Hunt back in 94
(to Sara)
Girlie open up that casket there
and see what you find

Sara glares at her but does as shes told goes to the large
ebony casket that supports Evelyns BIRTHDAY CAKE Sara looks
back at Evelyn suspiciously then sets the cake aside and
lifts the lid

Inside that seemingly free floating in space are SIX MINI-
COFFINS -- no more than eight inches long their doors
likewise propped open revealing inside each a gleaming new
GLOCK 9mm AUTOMATIC Each pistol black gunmetal in color of
course

EVELYN
Ooooh nice firearms this time

MELISSA
The warped factor here just gets
bigger and bigger

EVELYN
Stevens sense of humor just makes you
want to bust a gut dont it

SARA
Im in stitches

Sara takes one of the guns and attempts to eject the
magazine Nothing happens She looks

SARA
The clips been welded shut
EVELYN
On all of them probably

Evelyn takes one of the pistols and points it at her husband

EVELYN
So hows a girl to know if these
things are loaded baby

PRICE
Only one way I can think of Sweetheart

Tense beat ala Eastwood and Hackman staring each other down
at the end of Unforgiven Then Evelyn lowers the gun

EVELYN
No I think well let the young
lady have first crack

SARA
I dont want a gun I just want
out Lets go for Gods sake

PRICE
Ill meet you down there

EDDIE
(to Sara)
Take the gun

Sara takes the pistol from Evelyn and Pritchett
unenthusiastically beckons Eddie and Sara towards a hallway
leading to the basement Price trots towards another door off
the Salon

EVELYN
And where are we off to Mr Price
Check the wiring on the animatronic

Mummies

PRICE
A simple leak if its okay with you

And he disappears down the hall Melissa Marr jams a
cigarette in her mouth

MELISSA
Wow

She flicks her lighter sparking a flame to life --
SMASH TO
INT BASEMENT STAIRWAY - JUST AFTER

-- a flurry of crackling SPARKS showers Watson Pritchett as
he twists the 20s vintage knob light switch He leaps back
with a frightened yelp

We see a brief BURST OF LIGHT from the ancient sconces on the
walls revealing a series of moldy cobwebbed and rubble-
strewn basement gallery and a series of five glass cases
filled with the mummified remains of human bodies One very
odd human figure rides upon a mummified horse

INT BASEMENT GALLERY

An odd multi-walled gallery from which five corridors lead
out extending like the spokes of a wagon wheel --

-- and then every LIGHT down there SHORTS OUT with one loud
SIZZLING POP Total darkness Beat

PRITCHETTS VOICE
Yknow thisd actually be funny -- if I
didnt know for a fact Id be pleading
for a quick painless death in the next
few seconds

SARAS VOICE
Could somebody please just gag him
or something

Sara reaches into her bag and pulls out the flashlight
Pritchett gave her earlier

EDDIE
Youre a handy little thing to have
around

Suddenly a terrible cracking sound is heard above Saras
head She aims her light at the large beam overhead Just
then the beam gives way Eddie pulls her away just in
time

SARA
And youre not really as large and

useless as you seem

EDDIE
Im better than that

SARA
Dont push it

She thrusts the flashlight into Pritchetts hand

SARA
Now take us where this damn things at

INT SMALL GRIMY ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Price bursts through a hinged panel and whisper-shouts to
Schechter behind the computervideo console
PRICE
-- hey Next time give me a couple
seconds notice before you wing a gag
like that

SCHECTER
The lockdown thing

PRICE
I mean not that it didnt give Evelyn
the kind of coronary I had in mind

I was just sitting here -- it happened

I had nothing to do with it

PRICE
Then who did

SCHECTER
No idea I didnt even know the damn

SCHECTER
Maybe it was just its time to finally
fall apart

PRICE
No Somehow -- I dont know how --
she did it

SCHECTER

down the basement and your wifes
up in the bedroom the whole time

PRICE
Dont take your eyes off her for a
second I think she just declared War

INT MAIN SALON - SIMULTANEOUS

Evelyn a huge drink in her hand holding forth to a not
terribly interested Dr Blackburn Melissa Marrs oblivious
Camcorder to her eye slowly dollying herself out of the
room
EVELYN
Wedve been splitsville years ago with
me the richest single woman in recorded
history -- but Steven doesnt believe
in divorce

BLACKBURN
Not too big on it myself -- but then
again not on marriage either

EVELYN
Oh hes got no problem with that
Im his fourth

BLACKBURN
Im confused

EVELYN
No need for divorce and that messy
division-of-assets thing when they kick
before you do

MELISSA
All three of his previous wives
just up and died
EVELYN
Damnedest thing each one freaky little
accidents --

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

Sara Eddie and Pritchett continue searching

SARA
You should really open this place to the
public Pritchett -- a spa for people

without enough stress in their lives

PRITCHETT
I said we shouldnt come down here Very
treacherous -- physical and metaphysical

levels both Thereve been no
refurbishments to this part of the house
-- its exactly as it was in 1931

VOICE (0OS)
Is that a fact Mr Pritchett

They all whip around -- spooked to the max Pritchett shakily
trains the flashlight on who or whats behind them Price

PRICE
Sorry

SARA
Good way to get your head blown off

PRICE
Ill try not to remember to warn Evelyn

They soon pass a broken wall Rubble and debris litters the
floor Pritchett moves them quickly past the spot This
doesnt go unnoticed

EDDIE
Whats in there

PRITCHETT
(too quickly)
Nothing

Sara takes the flashlight from Pritchetts hand and aims it
into the dark hole beyond

ANGLE ON THE DOOR

The light glints on a HUGE STEEL DOOR A grime-covered
WINDOW is set at eye-level A black mold corrodes away the
edges

SARA
Nothing That seems like quite a door
to hold back nothing

Pritchett just stares at the door for an uncomfortably long
moment

EDDIE
What is it Whats in there

PRITCHETT
(finally)
The Soul of the House Everything thats
corrupt about it My father trapped it

in there just before he died You see
he purchased the house to restore it
We were going to live here Nothing
can live here I was just a kid The
first time I saw it I thought it was
beautiful It was just a dark mist
turning into the corner of the room
then it started to move then death
started to happen First the workers
six in all then my father

SARA
Ghosts killed your father

PRITCHETT
Not ghosts at least not what youre
thinking Vannacutt used to dump the

bodies of his failed experiments
somewhere in the house

SARA
And you think its in there

PRITCHETT
Accumulated evil festering for
decades
(switching gears
But Im a drunk so dont listen to
me

EDDIE
So youre saying as long as that door

stays locked were okay

PRITCHETT
Hell NO The House will kill ya

Pritchetts oblivious hes shining his light back down the

corridor -- at its terminus it splits into four new
corridors
PRITCHETT
I think we go down there and take a
right

The trio follow Pritchett WE remain staring at the STEEL
DOOR Almost imperceptibly -- or is it the darkness playing
tricks on us One of the streaks of mold seems to have grown
longer

CUT TO
INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Pritchett leading the three others down a new corridor
clearly clueless as to where the hell they are Shines the
flashlight up to find theyre in --
INT ELECTRO-SHOCK ROOM
a small room containing a large leather table with a myriad
of mildewed buckle-straps attached Behind the table a

monolithic brass and wood DYNAMO that looks powerful enough
to keep Orange County lit for a year

PRITCHETT
Electro-shock therapy Theres several
of them hooked together Dr Vannacutt

liked to zap his patients in multiples
of ten More energy-efficient or
something Lets try a left

They turn left A small barely noticeable arc of electricity
zaps from a dangling half-severed wire
CUT TO
INT SATURATION CHAMBER ROOM
Pritchett dead-ended in another room

PRITCHETT
Damn-it-all This is the Saturation
Chamber Left again

He all but yanks Price along with him Price blurting as he
disappears from frame

PRICE
Whats a Saturation Chamber

EDDIE and SARA linger staring at the big cast-iron capsule-
shaped contraption We hear Pritchetts Voice in the
distance explaining

PRITCHETT (0S)
New wrinkle on an old theory for
treating schizophrenia 19th Century I
think what would drive a sane man mad
should make a madman sane The Vannacutt
version was bombard the patient with
aural and visual stimuli far more
frightening than any hallucination they
could ever produce itd traumatize ‘em
back to normalcy

EDDIE
Did it work

Eddie looks up Pritchett and Price are nowhere to be seen

EDDIE
Hey Whered you guys go

PRITCHETT (0OS)

opposite direction

He shines the light through the cavernous space an immense
mechanism of cams pulleys and counterweights Price stares
in absolute awe -- this is something straight out of the
Industrial Revolution

He eyes the bank of long-handled mother-of-pearl tipped
levers

Its a lousy source of illumination but

a moment on her bottom Their eyes meet for a nanosecond

SARA

They start walking down the weirdly pulsing corridor

EDDIE
So who are you really

and well work forward from there

SARA
I told you already Jennifer Jenzen

house You dont fit the bill -- not
even close

SARA
(grinning)
Theres always exceptions

EDDIE

SARA
Look were all gonna be out of here in
a little while and go our separate ways

response from Eddie

SARA
Okay So lets say hypothetically

No response from Eddie

And suddenly she slams on the brakes -- because at the far

end of this Corridor she spots

EDDIE - quick-stepping right-to-left through the
intersection ahead

SARA
Hey pal game called on account
of boredom lets go --

And then she sees in the strobe-flicker of light his EYES

look devoid of pupils as though replaced by something
METALLIC

Eddie keeps walking turns into another corridor and
disappears from sight

SARA
What is your problem

She runs after him

CUT TO
INT BASEMENT - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

EDDIE -- perched above a Vat -- hes teetering his
equilibrium like a marionettes -- in danger of dropping

right into the Vat

SARA
What are you doing --
-- Eddie drops like a stone into the Vat

SARA
-- Eddie

She scrambles up to the top of the Vat looks down into it
nothing but that thick opaque muck -- but theres SOMETHING
ROILING beneath it Sara plunges her arms down into it --

SARA
-- Eddie Eddie Oh my god

-- BAM Something does -- yanking her down hard into the Vat
-- and continuing to pull -- shes to her shoulders in it --
and her heads about to go in --

SARA
-- Eddie

VOICE (0OS)
Over here

Sara darts the one eye still above the muck-line behind her

EDDIE MOSES -- is standing in the doorway a completely
baffled expression on his face

EDDIE
Whats going on you lose something
down there

SARA -- looks back down into the Vat in horror Lets out
a scream Whatevers in there releases her arms and she
goes tumbling ass-over-teakettle down to the floor her
arms released

Eddie runs to her takes her in his arms sopping himself in
the same blood

EDDIE
What are you doing Are you okay

Sara has no answer
INT THE MAIN SALON - SHORTLY AFTER

Pritchett enters the room The blood-caked Eddie and Sara
stumble in right behind them Pritchett grimaces

PRITCHETT
Now its marked the two of you

EVELYN
I suppose its too much to hope that
all that blood means --
A grim-faced Price enters

EVELYN
(disappointed)
-- nope hes still alive

She pours herself another huge drink

He makes a

PRICE
Evelyn could you just zip it fora
moment It looks like were stuck here
til morning -- lets make the best of
it

EDDIE
Best of a nightmare

SARA
There is something very not
normal going on here

PRITCHETT
This This is nothing Youve only been
dealing with the House itself You have
no idea what youre tinkering with
Sooner or later the darkness that is at

the core will get out One of you
will release it Not meaning to of
course then

(singing)

-Bye bye Miss American Pie

SARA
Pritchett what is this core of
darkness

PRITCHETT
I thought you understood Its the
souls of Vannacutts dead The
insanity The horror Victims burned
alive All that pain percolating
somewhere in the house for seventy-some
years

(singing)
Singing this will be the day that I
die This will be the day that I

beeline for the sideboard

BLACKBURN
There must be some other way out

PRICE
Well until thats found I think its a
good idea we all stick together
(turns to his wife)
Or wouldnt that fit into your plans

baby

EVELYN
Fine with me Just somebody then better
go and round up Melissa Marr

PRICE
Where is she

EVELYN
Stalking the wild poltergeist

INT HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

VIDEO IMAGE A DARKENED HALLWAY rife with grainy shadows
The image cruises down the corridor peering into the
twisting passageways that intersect our path as we drift
like some Flying Dutchman

INT HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

and we see that weve been watching from the POV of Melissa
Marrs CAMCORDER Shes gliding up and down the hallway
eye glued to the viewfinder taking in every square inch of
the place

POV CAMCORDER

The bumps and pits in the carved-stone CORRIDOR walls are
becoming more vivid

ANOTHER ANGLE

Melissa seen taking a left into ANOTHER HALLWAY

POV CAMCORDER

an ODD SHADOW plays in the corner at the end of this new
hallway The CORRIDOR appears to grow smaller more

claustrophobic

ANOTHER ANGLE

Melissa letting loose a half-uneasy half-exhilarated gulp
She stops walking Slowly lowers the Camcorder scans the
end of the hall with her naked eye

Other than having the creepy ambience as the rest of the
house the hall appears normal again large and long without
a trace of anything extraordinary She returns her eye to the
viewfinder

POV CAMCORDER

the SHIFTING SHADOW she saw before disappears into an OPEN
DOOR at the end of the hall
MELISSA (0OS)
Curiouser and curiouser Were talking a
fifty share minimum

-- just then a murmur of MANY VOICES heard around her
ANOTHER ANGLE

Melissa lowers the CAMCORDER eyes darting everywhere
scared -- but she sees nothing CAMERA back up to her eye
She moves to the doorway As she turns the corner we see
the PATTERN ON THE WALL It is really a painting done in
ANAMORPHOSIS - it has now become a terrible Gothic demon
ready to strike

POV CAMCORDER

We reach the vault-like door and peer down the steps that
disappear into a pool of darkness The VOICES heard again
Indistinct basso Emanating from somewhere below We
descend down the stairs

INT BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

MELISSA comes to a stop at the bottom of the stairs her eyes
go wide at the sight before her

WILD IMAGES painted by some long-dead madman start on the
floor sweep up across the wall and onto the ceiling

SHE PEERS CLOSER sees that theyre images of torture and
death painted in blood MELISSA stares at them wide-eyed
She puts the camera back up to her eye

POV CAMCORDER

the IMAGES come alive WRITHING in AGONY what passes for

their mouths open wide in silent screams Melissa is awe-

struck

MELISSA (0OS)
Fuck me bald

She moves down the corridor to a room at the end A sign
proclaims CEREBRAL HYGIENE As she nears the voices grow
louder And now mixed in with them are terrible MOANS

INT CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM -

Melissa enters --

POV CAMCORDER

A strange room filled with odd devices is laid out before us

Clearly left over from another era quack electric machines
and bizarre instruments line the walls
In the middle of the room a small group of PEOPLE in white
stand huddling urgently around something their backs to us
A MAN in white off to the side is filming whatever it is
going on with a spring-wound 16mm CAMERA

MELISSA (0OS)
Jesus

And then the Huddled Group whips around revealing the
objects of their-activity

TWO HUMANS -- crammed together on one gurney a Woman in

a savaged Nurses uniform a Man in what little is left of
his surgical scrubs a name plate pinned right into his
flesh Vannacutt

Both SCREAMING like banshees as theyre being VIVISECTED

It is the identical image we saw on the BandW footage from 1931
at the beginning of the movie

ANOTHER ANGLE
With a GASP MELISSA pulls the camera from her eye

She looks at the room the equipment is all there but the
room is completely EMPTY of anything living

She lets out a small sigh of relief and TURNS to leave --

-- and suddenly in front of her is THE PATIENT that
Vannacutt and Nurse had originally been dissecting Hes
jittering so fast hes a blur And then he lunges at her

INT MAIN SALON - SIMULTANEOUS

The SCREAMS of Melissa Marr echo wildly in the room -- long
agonized HOWLS that just grow louder and louder Everyone
looks up in alarm -- with the exception of Evelyn whose sole
focus is on pouring herself a new drink

EVELYN
Could be old Melissa found what she was
looking for

As the SCREAMS grow even more hideous Price and Guests dash
out of the room Pritchett downs the rest of his huge tumbler
of Scotch then proceeds very halfheartedly after them --

and then the SCREAMS stop Pritchett sits back down in his
chair pours another drink

PRITCHETT
Shes dead Chalk up one for the House

INT HALLWAY

Price and Blackburn striding down a long hallway eyes
darting everywhere shouting

PRICE
Melissa

BLACKBURN
Ms Marr

And then hearing from down in the basement

EDDIE (0OS)
Oh Jesus down here

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Price and Blackburn arrive to see Eddie and Sara standing
outside the door labeled Cerebral Hygiene

PRICE
What

BLACKBURN
Is she alright

SARA
-I dontknow

The two men follow their gaze To the FLOOR Lying there is
MARYS CAMCORDER the lens shattered the hand-grip broken
off

BLACKBURN
Something just mustvefrightened
her thats all

SARA
Yeahsomething

Sara holds up her finger its drenched with fresh blood And
with it she points into the empty room On the tile is a
wide red and glistening DRAG MARK leading from the doorway
to the foot of the half-rotted OPERATING TABLE

PRICE
Jesus

Price and Blackburn run into the room Blackburn kneels down
examines the drag mark Utterly baffled and not a little

unnerved

BLACKBURN
It juststops here

Sara sticks her head in the door nervously

SARA
Maybemaybe she went up on the table
Price runs a finger along the table bed hes able to dig a
trench the entire length of it through the three-inches-deep
worth of dust

PRICE
Nobody nothings been on this in67
years

Eddie stomps into the room frightened and frustrated trying
to make sense of it all

EDDIE
Well she went somewhere She didnt
just up and disappear into thin air

SARA
Nonot air --

The three men turn to look at her -- Saras staring at
something above them a spot on the CEILING directly over
the Operating Table where the bloody DRAG MARKS resume
continuing all the way to the point where concrete ceiling
meets equally solid wall and then vanish altogether

SARA
-- into the House

They just stare at the sight in dead scared-shitless
silence

HEARD OVER

EDDIE (VO)
Theres gotta be some way out --

INT MAIN SALON - SOON AFTER
Eddie seen haranguing a near-dead drunk Pritchett

EDDIE
-- of this place goddamnit Pritchett

PRITCHETT
Yes

Pritchett drains the last drops of his tumbler of Scotch

PRITCHETT
Alcoholic coma if you hurry

He starts to pour another --

-- Eddie swats both glass and bottle out of his hand they
SHATTER on the floor In this tension-packed room the sound
is magnified a hundred-fold Blackburn all but jumps out of
his skin
BLACKBURN
Jesus H Christ

PRITCHETT
Oh dear
BLACKBURN
(to Eddie)

If you dont calm the hell down Im
gonna strap you in for electro-shock

EDDIE
(waving his pistol)
How you gonna manage that with a new
blow-hole in your dome

SARA
Hey if everybodys gonna kill each
other could you do it in another room
Im trying to get something accomplished
here

We see that Saras sitting at a desk in the room fiddling
with the innards of Melissa Marrs camcorder

EDDIE
What the hell good is fixing that
gonna get us

SARA
An answer I hope exactly what -- or
who -- Melissa was taping

EDDIE

And then where are we

BLACKBURN
Put it this way if its your face on
that tape Mr Moses were one gunshot
away from solving all our problems --

EDDIE
-- fuck you

SARA
I got it Something anyway

The room goes silent -- on the PLAYBACK SCREEN on the side of
the CAMCORDER an erratic wildly rolling IMAGE can be seen

Everyone present Pritchett included starts gravitating
towards Sara and the desk She hits the STOP button on the
Camcorder

SARA
The motors working but the tapes
pretty much DOA -- I could only
rewind it back a couple of feet Dont
blink this is probably the first and
only showing

She punches PLAY And we see on the
CAMCORDERS PLAYBACK

soundless a vision of free flight -- the lens capturing
what it saw as it dropped to the ground a wild herky-
jerky ass-over-teakettle melange of --

WALLCEILINGMARYS HAIR -- and finally FLOOR as the
lens smacks TILE fractures into a starburst of cracks
topples onto its side And through this veil of JAGGED
SPIDERY LINES we see

MARYS HAND drop into frame -- lie still for a moment --
and then start VIOLENTLY SPASMING as a BLOODSTORM starts
spattering it from OS Until the color of her flesh can
no longer be seen --

A METAL CRUNCH is heard from inside the CAMCORDER and the
image on the screen goes to BLACK

INT MAIN SALON - CONTINUOUS

No one moves -- theyre all frozen there staring at the dead
screen Beat And then the sound of light APPLAUSE is heard

Heads turn towards its source and we see

EVELYN STOCKARD-PRICE leaning against one of the walls her
hands slowly almost angrily CLAPPING She doesnt speak
she seethes

EVELYN
Game set and match Steven Youve
outdone yourself And I know its not
good manners to ask the magician how he
did it but inquiring minds are
desperate to know just what did really

Sara strides to the coffin-cabinet and withdraws one of the
Glocks

PRICE
And what are you planning on doing

She cocks it
SARA

I just decided a million bucks is

(to Eddie)
Coming or staying

Eddie looks at his options Price Blackburn and Pritchett --
or Sara

EDDIE
Yeah what the hell Ill go

Yeah me too

Blackburn takes a gun from the coffin and cocks it

SARA
More the merrier

BLACKBURN
No Im going back to try and find Ms
Marr If shes hurt Ill tend to her
Dead then Im coming back for him

He glares at Price and exits in the opposite direction

Long beat Price stares at the befuddled Pritchett who seems
to be having a quiet conversation with himself

PRITCHETT
I thinkI may have the answer

PRICE
What

PRITCHETT
I rememberit was a long time agomy
father said when the House was finally
completed make surewe-christen-it-
with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne-
that-should-still-be-in a cupboard
somewhere

Pritchett is out of his chair extremely fast for someone with
a near-lethal blood alcohol level As he makes his exit he
grabs one of the last Glocks Turns sheepishly to Price

PRITCHETT
Nothing personal

He chambers a shell and exits Beat Price is alone in the
room

PRICE
Evelyn goddamnit --

INT SMALL GRIMY ROOM - JUST AFTER

-- and bursts through the hinged panel into computer
central shouting

PRICE
-- Schecter how is she pulling
this off

Schecter doesnt turn all his attention focused on the
computer screen his fingers stopped dead in the their tracks
upon the keys as though suddenly terrified by something
Price looks at the computer screen Two words typed there
Someone Else

PRICE
What does that mean

Schecter stays frozen Price is beside himself

PRICE
Schecter what the hell does it mean

He whips Schecter around in his swivel chair -- and comes
literally face-to-face with -- a Man who no longer has a
face Its like someone took a giant melon-baller to
Schecters head scooping out everything -- just leaving the
rind thats the interior wall of his skull Well mostly
everything theres still bits of bloody brain pulp hanging
from the bone Needless to say hes dead

Price turns away gagging in horror -- and his eye is
caught by a flash of motion in a --

VIDEO MONITOR -- the one trained on the Main Salon

A FIGURE (VANNACUTT) DRESSED ALL IN WHITE standing by the
sideboard looking up into the CAMERA -- a strange
stainless-steel device in his hands that looks half-
surgical sawhalf-speculum Something dark and wet dripping

from its knife-sharp edges

PRICE
Someone else Not Evelyn --

Prices Eyes jump to --
VIDEO MONITOR - THE ONE TRAINED ON THE BEDROOM

-- plain as day theres Evelyn under the covers

Prices eyes dart back to the SALON MONITOR -- the Figure in
White is no longer there But Price catches a flash the door
to the corridor just swinging shut Price jumps to his feet

and tears-ass out of the small room screeching

PRICE
Theres someone else in the House

INT CORRIDOR - MAIN FLOOR - SIMULTANEOUS

Eddie and Sara pulling with all their might on the iron grate
to one of the windows Eddie stops

EDDIE
You hear somebody
SARA
No -- keep pulling its moving

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS
Dr Blackburn armed with Saras flashlight and his medical
bag strides with determination through the labyrinth Then

stops when he hears a faint VOICE in the distance

DISTANT VOICE (0OS)
Blackburn

Blackburn finds hes stopped right by the door to the
Cerebral Hygiene room

BLACKBURN

SNAP OPEN simultaneously Beat In the distance a VOICE

The door SLAMS WHIP-PAN to Evelyns bed clearly its been
slept in -- but now its completely empty

Eddie and Sara drop their arms from the window exhausted

But there is now a space about two inches wide between IRON
GRATE and OPEN WINDOW
SARA
We can do it

EDDIE
Sure with three days anda

SARA
Its a thousand years old -- we just
need a crowbar or something to get
leverage -- the suckerll pop

EDDIE

No prob Ill just hop down the
hardware store --

SARA
-- no The basement -- the room with
all the controls to this thing big long
iron levers just lying there --

EDDIE
-- not a chance -- theres too much
weirdness down there I dont think even
bullets are gonna stop

SARA
Youre starting to sound like Pritchett

-- and then the LIGHTS zap to BLACK and Sara SHRIEKS --
INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

-- Pritchett shrieks as the LIGHTS ZAP BACK ON -- blinding --
then OFF AGAIN -- then ON --

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

-- the lights in the wall sconces are strobing like an
epileptics worst nightmare The sheer schizo-psychedelia of
it all has Dr Blackburn frozen in his tracks --

INT BASEMENT STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS
-- as is Price

-- then the SOUND starts Price is first to hear it -- it
puts an expression on his face like someone is ramming both
eardrums with icepicks over and over again

A LOUD CRACKLING ELECTRIC SURGE -- on-again off-again

in direct sync with the dimming of the lights What makes
it so especially unsettling is the noise that accompanies
each Sledgehammer Surge a straining strangulating CRY A
noise like a calf would make as its throat is slit
The light-show be damned Price leaps down the stairs
sprinting towards the Noise

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
-- likewise Dr Blackburn --

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

-- likewise Sara and Eddie running as fast as they can --

Price spies Blackburn at the other end of a Corridor shouts
over the Noise to him

PRICE
Where is it

BLACKBURN
I dont know

Sara and Eddie appear spot them Sara shouts

SARA
What is it

PRICE
Something with the power I dont know

And then Pritchett is seen at the far end of another
Corridor

Hes pointing to a long corridor - a light strobes at the
end

And then clarity comes to Prices eyes

PRICE
Electro-shock

INT HALLWAYELECTRO-SHOCK THERAPY ROOM - BASEMENT

-- and the Noise suddenly stops The lights stop pulsing
Pitch dark and dead quiet
Eddie squints and points at something deeper in the room

EDDIE
Theres something --

-- MOVING inside the Room Blackburn lashes his arm out
stopping anyone from going any further into the room He
whispers

BLACKBURN
Dont move dont make a sound

In the darkness in the distance they can make out

AN ANIMATE PRESENCE at waist level Pale With something
flowing from its sides almost wing-like And its
squirming undulating like a snake -- and then softly

this time that calf-like cry High-pitched almost female-
sounding

Price ducks under Blackburns arm and starts walking slowly
into the room towards it No one tries to stop him

ON PRICE as he gets closer and can see that whatever it
is its perched atop one of the TABLES --

-- the CRY -- and Price steps closer and he can make out
to the side of the table something that looks likea
hand

-- the CRY -- closer now a hand discerned -- human -- with

rings on the fingers polish on the nails --

PRICE
-Ms Marr

-- no response -- just the CRY -- Price reaches out to
touch that hand --

SARA
Is it Melissa

-- a look of horror comes to Prices face

PRICE
OH JESUS NO

-- and then lights flash BLINDING WHITE -- and the bug-eyed
face of EVELYN STOCKARD-PRICE is seen -- screaming that CRY
through the RUBBER BITE-DOWN thats been taped tight to her
teeth --

-- her head her torso her limbs BUCKING like theyre jet-
propelled against the leather straps restraining her --
-- as the MASSIVE VOLTS of electricity from the DYNAMO shes
wired to punch into her like ten thousand razors at once --

-- and Price reaches for her instinctively --
-- only to have Blackburn lunge in and yank his hand away --

BLACKBURN
-- are you crazy

-- and for a moment all anyone can do is watch as Evelyn
gets jolted and slammed again and again and again -- and
sparks fly from the electrodes on her head and smoke starts
to billow --

PRICE
Turn it off Somebody turn
the damn thing off

En masse the Guests charge into the room scrabbling
everywhere around the DYNAMO looking for a wire anything
they can use to stop the current ripping through her body --

-- and Price is near-insane smashing buttons yanking
switches off their moorings as he watches the pupils
disappear from the eyes of his bucking jerking wife --

-- and Sara pulls a cord from a socket in the wall and
nothing happens --

-- and Blackburn spies something running down the table

-- and Price is literally SCREAMING --

-- and Blackburn yanks the table-leg wire with all his
might --

-- and everything stops The light show The screaming The
smoke

-- and Evelyn too Her body drops back down on the table
with a horrible THUD Her eyes stare sightlessly Blackburn
leans over her Head to her chest a finger to her neck
Beat And then he stands back up straight

BLACKBURN
Im sorry --

PRICE
-- shes not dead Just have to

get her heart pumping aqain

SARA
Mouth-to-mouth

Price yanks the bite-piece from Evelyns mouth -- a plume of
purple ARTERIAL BLOOD spews from her lips and cascades all
over her face

EDDIE
Oh Jesus
PRICE
Adrenaline -- in your bag Blackburn

you must have --

BLACKBURN
-- even it we were in the ER
Price its too late -- her hearts
burst
Price puts his ear on Evelyns chest -- listens -- his face
falls
PRICE
No

Sara puts two fingers to Evelyns wrist pulse Feels

SARA
Shes gone

Even Pritchett gets into the act taking the flashlight and
shining it into Evelyns fixed pupils

PRITCHETT
They dont get any deader

Price strokes his wifes hair tears begin to form in his
eyes

PRICE
No

With his other hand Price begins to unbuckle the restraints

SARA
Idont thinkanybody should be
touching the body

PRICE
I think Ill do what I damn well please

BLACKBURN
Shes right Price Its a matter
for the police

He takes Prices hands firmly and removes them from Evelyn

PRICE
It is in-fucking-deed At the risk of
stating the obvious this wasnt exactly
a goddamn suicide
He smacks the now-loose steel-and-leather restraint with his
hand -- in the tense silence of the room the buckle BANGS
like a GUNSHOT against the table over and over again

PRITCHETT
House 2 Guests 0

PRICE
I think Pritchett weve got a
situation here that even you cant
explain away as ghosts This is ice-
cold homicide by person -- or persons --

He glares furiously at his Guests

SARA
-- not entirely unknown

She cocks her pistol and aims it at Price

PRICE
Convenient place to point blame hon
but this time the only wrong one for
all I know somebody should be pointing
that gun at you

She shakes her head and keeps the gun where it is

SARA
I was upstairs with Eddie --

EDDIE
-- thats the fact bud --

SARA
-- where the hell were you

PRICE
Upstairs too Come with me Ill show

PRICE
-- yeah we did that --

SARA
-- the window and door grates --

PRICE
-- no -- thats when everything went
ragtime -- whoever else is in this house

BLACKBURN
-- which is why you killed her

And now he takes his pistol and cocks it at Price

PRICE
I was upstairs

SARA
I never saw you --

BLACKBURN
-- I did down here

EDDIE
And I think thats case --

-- likewise producing his gun and chambering a shell

EDDIE

Pritchett fumbles out his pistol

PRITCHETT
-- then I guess then it had to be

PRICE
Thank God -- I was afraid Id be
lynched without a quorum

SARA
If youve got a gun on you Price
Id hand it over now

PRICE

SARA
Fascinated

PRICE
I was chasing after somebody I saw

BLACKBURN

Vannacutt

PRICE
Then just wait -- maybe this whoevers

SARA
Ill take my chances

PRICE

And now Price produces his gun
BLACKBURN
If there really is someone else in this
house I think the four of us can handle
the situation
PRICE
I think one of you has been part and

parcel of making this situation

SARA
The gun Price hand it over now

Price cocks his pistol

PRICE
Dont test me Im real prepared to
use this to stay alive --

SARA

SARA

SARA
-- no more --

-- she reaches for his gun --

PRICE
-- no

And Price pulls the trigger right in her face

SARA
NO

Onlytheres no explosive report no whine of bullets --
just this CLICK CLICK CLICK from Prices gun

The room freezes for a moment -- wide-eyed shock all around
Price looks down at his Glock the weld on the clips been
broken

PRICE
Who fucked with my gun

Freeze broken Eddie lunges for him

EDDIE
You sonovabitch

And he tackles Price to the floor punching the gun from
Prices grasp and nailing him in the face a few times for
good measure Price is down for the count

Pritchett walks towards the stairs Blackburn looks to Sara

BLACKBURN
Now what do we do Weve got to
hold him somewhere til the police --

SARA
-- the Saturation Chamber Where
he wanted to put me

Pritchett stops in his tracks on the stairs alarmed

PRITCHETT
What would drive a madman sane would
drive a sane man mad
(pauses)
I need a drink Anyone wants me Ill
either be upstairs or dismembered

INT SATURATION CHAMBER ROOM - JUST AFTER

Price lets out a scream as Eddie SLAMS the door to the
Saturation Chamber Prices face appears in the small
porthole

Sara twists the WHEEL that seals tight the cast-iron capsule-
shaped device Asks Blackburn

SARA
Pretty old and rusted out -- you sure
this thingll hold him

Through the single small window on the side we can see a
furious panicked Price slam his full weight against the
inside of the door It doesnt budge a millimeter

BLACKBURN
Dont think itll be a problem

SARA
(to Eddie)
Cmon

Through the Chamber window we see Price make another futile
CRASH against the door

EDDIE
Shouldnt somebody like stand guard
or something -- just in case
BLACKBURN

Ill stay if itll ease your mind

EDDIE
You sure Youll be alright by yourself

Blackburn pats the gun in his jacket pocket

BLACKBURN
Im not worried
Sara nods takes Eddies hand and disappears up the stairs

Blackburn and Price stare at each other on opposite sides of
the tiny window Price is screeching something at him but we
cant hear a word through all that iron

BLACKBURN
Cant quite make that out -- what

Price silently bellows

BLACKBURN
You want to see how this thing
works Weird request but okay

Blackburn leans over and starts twisting dials and flipping
every switch he can find on the CONTROL PANEL of the capsule

We see Price look up in alarm a CIRCLE OF PULSING LIGHTS is
dappling down on him It looks almost quaint like a
Victorian carousel at night

BLACKBURN
Youve got to let me know how it all
turns out Professional courtesy and all
that

And with Price seen yelling and pounding through the window
BLACKBURN walks away and disappears into the dark of the
basement He passes right by the huge sealed STEEL DOOR
where Vannacutt stashed his corpses The tendrils of mold on
the metal have expanded to the length of a mans arm

INT SATURATION CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Price is down on the floor of the capsule a look both of
fear and an engineers curiosity on his face as he stares up
at the CIRCLE OF LIGHT that has begun to spin faster and
faster --

-- and then whatever anxiety he has abruptly drops from his
face Aside from a little eye-strain absolutely nothings
happening to him He stands and examines the source of the
light Sees on the ceiling of the capsule its nothing more
than a spinning mirror ball-like apparatus flecked with
colored glass Hes unimpressed

PRICE
Technology by Fred Flintstone

He turns away from it braces himself against a wall

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Where we view Price from outside the Capsule Through its
tiny window we see him silently jerk spasm and scream -- all
while standing inside the utterly empty Saturation Chamber

OVER we hear almost bestial-sounding grunts
INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

Sara and Eddie move through the corridor - stopping at
every junction Theyre hopelessly lost

EDDIE
I think we should have taken a right
back there

SARA
Back where

They scan the maze of interconnecting passageways behind
them

EDDIE
Good point

SARA
(pointing to another hallway)
Lets try down here

They move in that direction turning a corner and passing
several doorways Eddie glances at the door theyre about

to pass and stops

EDDIE
Hey check it out

Sara stops and looks at the wire glass door A nameplate
reads DR RICHARD B VANNACUTT

SARA
Vannacutts office

She tries the door handle Its unlocked They move inside
slowly

INT VANNACUTTS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Inside is an amazing collection of debris partially
ransacked

File cabinets are open and the floor is littered with
papers On shelves are bottles of specimens of body parts

and dead sea life floating in formaldehyde

Sara moves over to Vannacutts desk and begins going
through the drawers Eddie stares at the specimens

EDDIE
What are you looking for

SARA
Maybe there are notes or drawings of
this place showing how those plates
work

Eddie pulls a picture from the wall The glass is
cracked Sara looks back at Eddie and moves to him

SARA (contd)
Whatve you got

EDDIE
Class of 1931

ECU - THE PICTURE shows the various doctors and nurses in
resident The banner above the corroding image states
THE VANNACUTT INSTITUTE STAFF FOR 1931 Below each face is

a name and position

SARA
Cheery looking bunch

EDDIE
Better living through electricity

Sara notices something about the photo
SARA

Holy shit Now we know how the guest
list was made up Look these names

Head Nurse Ruth-Ann Stockard Bjorn

Jensen Electro Therapy Jasper Marr

Thomas Steven Price Theyre all here
EDDIE

Wait a minute What are you saying
SARA

Everyone that was invited is related to
one of the staff who was here when the
place burned There are five of us

Suddenly another voice is heard

PRITCHETT
And five that didnt die

Sara and Eddie just about jump out of their skins
Pritchett is standing in the doorway in his usual sloshed

condition

EDDIE
Shit Pritchett

PRITCHETT
Price didnt make the guest list The
house did It wants vengeance

EDDIE
Hows a goddamn building gonna send out
invitations

PRITCHETT

Eddie stares at the photo

EDDIE

INT ELECTRO-SHOCK ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

CUT TO

Dr Blackburn opens the door to the room and walks grimly

into it
table

staring at Evelyns dead body

BLACKBURN
The late Mrs Steven Price

From his medical-bag he removes a scalpel

With a blur of quick slashes

BLACKBURN
Tragic tortured Mrs Steven Price

free of their moldy restraints

BLACKBURN
Lovely Mrs Steven Price

Now accessible he parts the top of her nightgown
finger slowwwwly from the tip of her chin down to her bare

still strapped to the

Runs a

BLACKBURN
Creamy cooland now very

cooperative Mrs Steven Price

His tongue darts from his lips and he begins planting long
lingering kisses all over her neck --

-- FLASH of a hypodermic being pulled from Blackburns bag --
-- Blackburn kissing everywhere around her breasts --

-- FLASH of the air bubbles in the needle being plunged out
of the tip squirt --

-- bubbles of Blackburns saliva dampening her nipples his
tongue swabbing concentric circles within her aureole --

-- FLASH the needle into the crook of Evelyns elbow --

-- Blackburns mouth dancing down to her belly -- hes begun
to hyperventilate with excitement -- and

A HAND comes languidly into frame begins stroking his lush
dyed locks --

VOICE (0OS)
Ive missed you

BLACKBURN
Ive missed this

And Dr Blackburn tosses the hypo away and hoists himself to
meet the eager waiting mouth of the now very alive EVELYN
STOCKARD-PRICE -- who starts to vigorously respond to
Blackburns touch He reluctantly pulls himself away

BLACKBURN
Easy Youve got to keep still fora
bit the last thing we need is a
coronary

EVELYN
Youre the Doctor sweetheart Guess
the atropine worked then

BLACKBURN
Convinced all those that needed
convincing youre an official dead
lady

EVELYN
And whats Stevens status

BLACKBURN
Still alive but its just a matter
of time And then will come your
miraculous resurrection --

EVELYN
-- oh no Officer Im very much
alive -- just a joke to beat my

husband at his own clever game --
What What do you mean hes dead
Its all my fault I may as well
have killed him myself

BLACKBURN
But you didnt Maam We have all
these witnesses that saw well

whoever it ends up being that finally
shoots him --

EVELYN
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair
trigger --

BLACKBURN
-- or might turn out to be -- very big
surprise -- that Jenzen girl The little

bitch has the right stuff She nearly
put a bullet in Price right after your
demise

EVELYN
So what stopped her

BLACKBURN
Its complicated But dont worry --

EVELYN
-- theres already been way too many
complications for a very simple plan
You ever find out what happened to
Melissa Marr

BLACKBURN
Not yet

EVELYN
So we dont even know if shes
alive or dead --

BLACKBURN
-- Price killed her theres no
other explanation --

EVELYN
-- theres plenty for all we know
Stevens got her spying on us right
now -—

BLACKBURN
-- bullshit --

EVELYN
-- the whole thing is falling apart

Blackburn starts stroking her trying to calm her

-- and in one savage blur of motion

BLACKBURN
Its not baby Just a matter of
minutes now before somebody
pulls the trigger --

EVELYN
-- but nobody has yet Donald They
just havent been brought to that
breaking point They have to believe
proof-positive that their lives
are in danger

BLACKBURN
How much more do they need than
your death at his hands

EVELYN
But they didnt see it happen they
still have doubts What we need is
another body and Stevens bloody
hands right next to it

BLACKBURN
And how the hell are we going
to do that

EVELYN
Okay this may sound crazy but --

Blackburns scalpel right into his chest

Blackburn just stands there motionless

confused

yanking down gutting him like hes a trout

INT MAIN SALON - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Eddie trots into the room

wrought-iron floor lamp To Sara

They start out of the room

EDDIE
This is the best were gonna do

SARA
Itll have to do

sitting in his chair

Evelyn drives

looking at her
She clears up any gray areas thrusting deep and

carrying the thick base of a

Watson Pritchett remains morosely
SARA
You coming or are you waiting
for Blackburn

PRITCHETT
Blackburns dead

SARA
Excuse me

PRITCHETT
He would have been back by now

Beat Eddie and Sara look at each other nahhhh And then

SARA
Hey Dr Blackburn

Nothing in response Sara grabs Pritchett and they head for
the basement

INT BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

-- the beautiful blood-caked FEET of Evelyn Stockard-Price
seen walking across the concrete

Her gore-sopped HAND seen traveling upwards -- we follow it --
-- as it undoes the lock on the door of the now pitch-dark --
INT SATURATION CHAMBER ROOM

Beat And then the inert body of STEVEN PRICE slumps out

Evelyn walks out of frame Beat Then a WHIMPER is heard

It seems to be coming from the throat of Steven Price

INT BASEMENT - CORRIDORS - SIMULTANEOUS

The lights have begun strobing again Sara Eddie and
Pritchett move quickly down corridor after corridor --

SARA
Dr Blackburn

-- finally stumbling into

INT SATURATION CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- where the circle of pulsing lights inside the Chamber
itself are as bold and blinding as looking into the sun
Lighting up the entire room they can barely make out a thing

-- except

A FACE -- frozen in a scream thats pressed against the
capsules window

EDDIE
Well at least Price is still
under wraps

Sara squints And then her eyes grow wide --

SARA
Its Blackburn

-- the FACE in the window comes into focus

DR DONALD W BLACKBURN

The trio moves to the Chamber amidst the blinding lights
shield their eyes and throw the door open -- A BODY --

comes tumbling out the door closing shut behind it

The three of them are in shock Blackburns face is still
pressed against the window And then Sara re-opens the door

And they see theres nothing attached to Blackburns head
its just propped in the small sill of the window And the
body on the floor just happens to be missing same

And then Sara sets her teeth and pulls out her gun

INT BASEMENT - CORRIDORS - JUST AFTER

Sara and Eddie on a mission Glocks in hand and ready
stalking like cats through the maze of corridors

EDDIE
Price

SARA
Hes gotta still be down here

Pritchett is less enthused
PRITCHETT
You know that crowbar that window

Maybe we should just call it a --

SARAEDDIE
-- Pritchett shut the fuck up

PRITCHETT
Oh dear

SARA
Price

PRITCHETT
Oh dear

EDDIE

Pritchett --
And then he sees that Pritchetts staring slack-jawed into
the

INT MORGUE ROOM

-- the table where the body of Evelyn Stockard-Price once
lay is now empty and blood-soaked

EDDIE
Price what the fuck did you do

Eddie turns enraged to Sara Shes nowhere to be seen

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

Sara is wending her way down a passage gun now lowered
slightly For what shes in pursuit of is something that
seems not only non-threatening but familiar a soft high-
pitched VOICE that sounds in pain crying

VOICE (0OS)
Please anyonehelp me

SARA
Melissa

VOICE (0OS)

For the love of Godplease
SARA

Melissa its Sara -- is that you
VOICE (0OS)

Sara
SARA

Keep talking Ill find you

VOICE (0OS)
Somethinghappened --

SARA
-- Im coming --

VOICE (0OS)
-- something horribleI dont
understand --
The Voice is somewhere close now -- within just a few feet of
her -- but Sara can see no one
SARA

If you can stand if you can just
raise your arm --

-- and then from behind a tall pile of stone and mortar
rubble rises a bloody and absolutely terrified
STEVEN PRICE -- so freaked-out his Voice is just a squeak

PRICE
I woke up on the floorthere
was Dr BlackburnI dont know
what happened

Saras surprise quickly fades -- replaced by cold stone
anger

SARA
I do

Price rises and starts to slowly approach her hands in front
of him stretched in supplication

PRICE
Then tell me please -- help me

SARA
Dont think so Stay the fuck back

PRICE
Please I need your help

SARA
Not even for a million dollars Mr
Price

-- and Sara squeezes the trigger --

PRICE
-- no --

-- the first shot splits a brick right next to his ear --
pieces flying everywhere --

-- the next six are all right on torso-target 45 caliber
slugs that make a nice round black hole as they hit him --
huge ragged explosions of blood and meat as they exit
Hideous Bonnie and Clyde died in their sleep in comparison
Pritchett and Eddie enter on the run

EDDIE
What the hell are you shooting --

-- and then he sees the riddled Price on the ground

EDDIE
Oh Jesus

PRITCHETT
Poor Mr Price --

SARA
-- fuck Mr Price --
He takes the shaking wild-eyed Sara in his arms She doesnt
weep just stands there spasming with shock

EDDIE
Its okay everythings okay now

SARA
Hes dead

Eddie takes one more look at the carnage

EDDIE
Dont think its even an issue

SARA
Were safe

PRITCHETT
Uhhhh
EDDIE
What
PRITCHETT
Okay -- Ill admit it Im totally

clinically insane But Im still the
only one who actually got a check
tonight Its yours -- if you just get
me the hell out of here now

EDDIESARA
You got yourself a deal

They exit the room heading for the stairs not looking back
at Prices corpse for a second Beat And then emerging from
the shadows strolls EVELYN who walks over to her husbands
body talking to it

EVELYN
Steven you poor absolutely clueless
geek All it wouldve taken was a simple
divorce -- and ripping our pre-nup to
little pieces

She kneels down next to the bioody corpse whispers

EVELYN
But no matter how it ended please know
just one thing from that first moment I
set eyes on you Ive always loved
your money You personally -- well
frankly just the sight of you has always
turned my stomach

A HAND suddenly lashes out and grabs her hard by the
throat
VOICE
Is that a fact Princess

EVELYNS EYES widen in horror as she chokes out a GASP The
hand belongs to STEVEN PRICE and he literally picks her up
by her neck and brings her to her feet

PRICE
Well you could have saved us all a
great deal of time not to mention
money if youd just let me in on it
years ago

With his free hand he rips off his shirt -- and the blood-
squibbed Kevlar vest underneath it

PRICE
This kind of special effects crap
doesnt come cheap -- and I had to pay

out of pocket No write-offs here

He begins moving toward her She instinctively backs away
slowly being cornered in an alcove

EVELYN
How --

In the alcove is a door -- a very familiar door -- the sealed
steel portal leading to Vannacutts body dump The metal is
so corroded its surface is misshapen with rust

PRICE
-- you must be kidding Youre talking
to Steven Price -- every place youve

gone every person youve seen every
word you and Blackburn ever said to each
other bugged taped seen and heard as
it happened

He squeezes tighter now with both hands she can barely
breathe

EVELYN
Steven --

PRICE
-- anything sweetheart you need only
speak --

EVELYN

-- whatareyougoingto --

PRICE
-- just what you wanted everyone here
to believe in the first place Im going
to murder you Evelyn with the greatest
of pleasure --

EVELYN
-- witnesses --

PRICE
-- witnesses to what Youre already
dead Evelyn Happy Birthday baby --

-- and before Evelyn can even let out a gasp hes SLAMS her
up against a door

Her body smacks against the rusted metal with a rotted CRACK
The solid door EXPLODES inward in a shower of rust The
rest of the door drops with a thud from its moldy hinges
sending Price and Evelyn hurtling down with it into the
room

INT DECAYING ROOM

Stunned for a moment Evelyn and Price suddenly become aware
that there is another presence in the room

something DARK -- CHURNING -- TERRIBLE
EVELYNS EYES look across the floorboards the DUST on the
floor stands up on end and starts to move like metal filings

being pulled by a magnet

EVELYN
Steven Are you doing that

A dazed Price pulls himself to his feet he can only hold the
cut that the fall has opened on his forehead and stare at the

movement on the floor

PRICE
No

EVELYN
No OhmyGod Pritchett was right --
The house IS haunted

EVELYN tries to right herself Prices EYES fix on the wall
behind her trembling

PRICE
Evelyn Get up NOW

EVELYN
Steven

She turns and follows his gaze
A CREEPING DARKNESS is gathering on the wall behind her

PRICE
Its the Patients -- the Evil -- weve
released it --

Price tries to move but he cant -- just stands there
paralyzed with the surreal horror of it all

EVELYN scrambles to her feet Price backs up in horror

EVELYN
NO --

Evelyn BOLTS for the door She doesnt get far Because
suddenly THE CHURNING SHADOWY MASS springs forward Grabbing
Evelyn and SLAMMING her back against the wall

She tries to cry out -- but the dark shape on the wall has
begun to ENGULF her literally corroding her flesh

BLACK TENDRILS like acid-tipped vines scuttle all over
her eating every inch of her body Her TEETH drop from
their gums her EYES rot out of their sockets her RIBS
sizzle from her chest -- until she no longer has solid
human form --

Shes just a flat silent-screaming image burntetched flush
into the wall -- just like the gruesome images Melissa Marr
saw through her Camcorder painted on the corridor walls
outside Vannacutts operating room

Price every limb shaking backs out of the room into the --
INT BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

-- his eyes shooting every which way in fear of God-knows-
what new nightmare -- it doesnt take long Subtle at first

-- glimpses caught out of the corner of his eye -- of SHADOWS
in the room seeming to move

-- PHFT -- on the ceiling -- Price whips his head up --
-- PHFT -- did he see something on the rear wall --
-- PHFT -- motion from a corner of the floor --

THEN all the SHADOWS IN THE ROOM - begin to move together
toward the center of the room -- coalescing into one huge
MASS OF DARKNESS

Price doesnt hang around to see what happens next -- he
bolts from the room -- only to smack right into AN OLD
RUSTED MEDICAL CABINET that swings open to reveal inside one
of its doors a 1920s vintage ANATOMICAL CHART with all the
human organs and parts cut up and re-arranged so that they
are displayed alphabetically viewing top-to-bottom

And then Prices whole face goes fright-white on the inside
of THE OTHER DOOR are the organs and parts of MELISSA MARR
likewise cut up and alphabetized -- her decapitated head near
the bottom labeled skull

Price GASPS and dashes back down the corridor to find that
the Mass of Darkness has evolved into a HUGE constantly
morphing THREE-DIHENSIONAL BEING that lets out a nails-on-
blackboard SCREECH and charges right for him

INT UPSTAIRS - HALLWAY

Where Sara Eddie and Pritchett are trying with all their
might to pry open the slightly-ajar window -- when they hear

PRICE (0OS)
He was right Pritchett was right

PRITCHETT
I am

Sara and Eddie dash further down the
INT UPSTAIRS KALLWAY

where Price staggers into the doorway that leads to the
basement stairs -- frenzied nearly all his strength gone

PRICE
Itsthe House

And then the MASS OF DARKNESS swirls into sight from below --
envelops Price -- and sucks him back downstairs screaming

The door slams shut
Beat The three of them just stand there speechless Then

EDDIE
What --

SARA
-- was that

PRITCHETT
Somethingthat should probably
beavoided --
-- they turn tail and tear from the room back to
INT HALLWAY
where they rush toward the partially pried-open window
SARA
The openings still too small

well never get through

EDDIE
For chrissake give me a hand

Three pairs of HANDS grab onto the pry-bar and throw all
their weight behind it As they strain and the metal shrieks

SARA
Pritchett what is going on

PRITCHETT
He mustve unsealed the room

SARA
How hes supposed to be dead

A POWERFUL GROAN reverberates through the house the sound of
timbers bending and twisting

EDDIES HEAD whips right - out of the corner of his eye
something seen MOVING

THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT - its turning BLACK -- GANGRENOUS
-- its PUTREFYING before their eyes -- bowing in and
collapsing as it ROTS

SARA
I thinkits timeto go

They whip around and run down the hall toward the living
room As they near the end they are stopped dead in their
track

THEIR POV

A WALL nearby TWISTS and BENDS into a new and different
WALL -- one with DOORS that now swing open -- leading to
some dark oblivion

INT HALLWAY

They stare at the sight before them

PRITCHETT
Hail Mary full of grace -- the house is
growing

EDDIE

Its not going to let us out

SARA
(sensing something)
No Its just trying to frighten us

EDDIE
Its succeeding

SARA
All the plates sealing the windows and
doors -- theres got to be some way of
raising them manually They didnt just
appear out of thin air -- theres got

to be pulleys cables or something that
make them go up and down

PRITCHETT
In the attic

The WALL at the end of the corridor is bending and twisting
taking on a new hideous shape

EDDIE
If you know where it is get there

PRITCHETT
Me Youve gotta be kidding

The SHADOW THING rounds the bend at the end of the corridor --
its enveloped the entire CEILING

Pritchett looks at Sara and Eddie plaintively --

SARA
Move

-- then BOLTS reluctantly down the hall Just as THE THING
OF SHADOWS drops down from the ceiling begins spreading out
across the floor and sinking into the floorboards
Disappearing And then a terrible SILENCE

EDDIE
Where did it go

SARA
Run

EDDIE
What --

-- and then the FLOORBOARDS of the corridor start EXPLODING
in a path toward Sara and Eddie

SARA
I said run

They race down the corridor Behind them the floor is ripping
up sending debris into the air

Sara and Eddie dash into another corridor Shit A cul-de-
sac terminating with nothing but solid wall They whip back

around only to see

THE EXPLODING FLOOR banging a hard right and hurtling
straight down the cul-de-sac right for them

Trapped they just stare terrified and helpless - and then
Eddie looks up and spots
An ORNATE CHANDELIER hanging above them
The EXPLODING FLOORBOARDS are nearly upon them

EDDIE LEAPS up grabbing the bottom on the fixture He begins
pulling himself up

A FLOORBOARD next to Saras foot detonates -- she screams
SARA
EDDIE
He grabs her and pulls her up -- just as every floorboard

shes standing on ERUPTS AND GOES FLYING opening a HUGE
CHASM below them

The two of them exchange a glance that is simultaneously Im
okayyoure okayare we both going nuts Thats when they
hear a METALLIC SCREECH above them

THE CHANDELIER is ripping out of the ceiling PING BAM Two
of the three remaining screws pop free and go flying -- the
chandeliers mount takes a 90-degree screechnjolt - and

Saras already tenuous grip is lost She crashes helplessly
down into the CHASM disappearing into the black void below

INT DECAYING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sara lands with a THUD buried knee-deep in the rotted floor
of the room below The Room -- where Evelyn met her demise

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Eddie manages to swing the chandelier over to the side where
the floor is still intact

INT DECAYING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Saras just about cleared her head from the fall -- when her
eyes go wide Looks down shes SINKING INTO THE FLOOR

She cries out -- and suddenly everything beneath her just
lets go And shes hurtling like a rock down into

INT SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
SARA lands on her face in some pitch-black space

When her eyes adjust she sees shes in a vault-like room
that is filled with stalagmite-like MOUNDS OF DIRT AND ROCK
Bizarre geological formations each one unique in its own
skewed way it appears for a moment as though Sara has fallen
across time and space and onto the surface of a planet we
dont even have a name for yet
INT THE HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - SIMULTANEOUS

The full ANGER of this place is now manifesting

-- WALLS writhe and twist in fury forming

-- STAIRWAYS that shake themselves into splinters of frenzy
-- CARVINGS in the wainscotted paneling that become animate
and turn upon themselves cannibalizing the writhing
screaming walls that spawned them

darkness that seems to go on forever

INT SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER - SIMULTANEOUS

As Sara tries to pull herself to her feet she sees DIRT and
ROCK beginning to FALL from the strange FORMATIONS
surrounding her And then all becomes clear as to where and
who shes with

Beneath all that effluence are the REMAINS of Vannacutts
VICTIMS Some are missing body parts Some are only body
parts Some are bound with leather straps as if they were
just dumped there after dying on the electro-shock or
dissection table

SARA lets out the SCREAM of her life

Eddie hears her and bolts madly down the hall

EDDIE

He races toward the stairwell leading to the basement
INT SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Sara leaps to her feet and tries to reach for the hole in the
ceiling - its just out of reach

Then she senses something else in there with her
Reluctantly she turns around

splits into parts and disappears into the rotted corpses AND

Sara and Eddie start up the stairs - behind them the hallway
is turning black with decay

SARA
Move

They race up the stairs --

INT ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

-- arriving in another part of the attic
Sara looks around trying to get her bearings

EDDIE
Pritchett

A DISTANT VOICE

PRITCHETT (0OS)
Over here

The attic is a labyrinth of dangling cables counterweights
and their often neck-high metal moorings Sara moves toward
the sound of his voice Eddie hangs back sensing something
SARA slowly wends her way through all the mishigas

UNSEEN by her down by her carefully treading feet the
Shadow Mass is filtering up through the slits in the attics
floor

SARA edges her way around a tall iron fly-rail --

-- and something grabs at her hand Shes had enough she
reaches back to slug it -- then stops

Its Pritchett

PRITCHETT
Please Its been a bad enough day --

-- and now the SHADOW MASS has re-assembled to its new full
enormity It begins to barrel across the attic towards
Pritchett and Sara who dont have a clue -- Eddie does

EDDIE
Get out ot the way

Sara turns back toward him Eddie rushes and pushes her to
the side as the Shadow Mass is just about to envelop her
And EDDIE is STRUCK full-force -- he instantaneously turns to
a blackened mass

SARA
Eddie

And then the wind from outside kicks up blowing EDDIE AWAY
like so much powder And Sara just crumples

At the other end of the attic the Shadow Mass is TURNING
back toward them

Pritchett rushes in -- GRABS SARA -- and pulls her towards
the small dormer window -- the CABLE holding the plate snaps
three of its last four strands --

-- Pritchett pushes Sara through the window -- just as the
CABLE holding the plate finally breaks trapping Pritchett
inside

Its now back to near pitch-black again in there Pritchett
turns to see

The FACES of all of Vannacutts VICTIMS taking form in the
immense Shadow Mass -- all with that revenge-on-the-living
look in their empty-socket eyes

Suddenly from the swirling dark center of the mass THE
FLAMING HEAD OF DR RICHARD VANNACUTT appears BLASTING a
HOT BREATH at Pritchett who is freaking out

PRITCHETT
Im just the contractors son I
had nothing to do with your current
condition

The words seem to have little impact on the steadily
approaching Mass of Faces

-- and then suddenly SUNLIGHT POURS in behind him Sara has
pried the plate up with a LIGHTNING ROD -- one thats in the
process of bending in two under all the weigh

SARA
I think if youre coming Mr
Pritchett its now or never
The Mass of Faces starts to creep up Pritchetts shoe With a
screech he flings himself backwards literally diving
through the open window --
CUT TO
EXT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

-- as the LIGHTNING ROD SNAPS -- and the IRON PLATE comes
guillotine-slamming back down -- right onto Pritchetts foot
He screams and hysterically yanks at his ankle --

-- his foot emerging safe-and-sound and whole the shredded
remnants of a white sock blowing in the morning sea-breeze

Sara and Pritchett exchange looks Theyre both missing
shoes They shrug The sunlight warms their faces

FADE TO BLACK

And in the darkness we hear a familiar Voice

CHRISTOPHER LEE (VO)
The Police and Coroner arrived at
the House on Haunted Hill at 730
am Pacific Standard Time

FADE BACK UP ON

EXT HOUSE - MORNING

A fleet of milling Cops Paramedics Fire Officials
Ambulances the works Sara seen getting her legs treated A
blank-faced Pritchett being grilled by LA Sheriffs

Gurneys toting very full body bags from the house One gurney
carrying a half dozen vary small bags Melissa Marr most
likely

CHRISTOPHER LEE (VO)
Watson Pritchett told the Police
that they need a Sherman tank to
get into the house But when the
first officer on the scene tried
the front door knob it opened
without so much as a squeak

CUT TO
INT HOUSE - (NEWSREEL FOOTAGE) - VARIOUS SHOTS
-- Grand Foyer
-- Main Salon
-- Basement
-- Corridors
CHRISTOPHER LEE (VO)

And for all the horror that Pritchett

described the House was found to be

utterly unexceptional and undisturbed

-- even the dust still in place

We see that what hes saying is true theres no evidence
that anything ever happened here Even the basement -- the
Electro-shock and Saturation Chamber -- appear exactly as

when we first saw them Even the restraints that were cut

have been made whole again

INT LIMBO SET - NIGHT
SLOW PULL BACK to Christopher Lee on the Terrifying But

True set talking to us as the footage continues to play
on a screen behind him

CHRISTOPHER LEE
And not one sign of the partys
hosts Steven and Evelyn Price
The only person not surprised
by this was Watson Pritchett

ON THE SCREEN BEHIND HIM
EXT HOUSE - MORNING
A close-up of Pritchett seen talking

PRITCHETT
Theyre part ot the House now
Thats the way it works

BACK TO SCENE

CHRISTOPHER LEE
The truth will likely be never
known Unless on some strange
whim you decide to spend the
evening inside the House on
Haunted Hill

(he smiles)
Good night

And walks 0S The TV CAMERA pans back to the projection
screen

As the Terrifying But True credits crawl underneath them
we see the old silent black and white footage weve seen
before

INT CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM (BandW)

1931 The Cerebral Hygiene Room The rampaging Patients
huddling around an operating table A blur of scalpels and
saws as they viciously vivisect Dr Vannacutt and his Nurse
crammed together on the same gurney

THE IMAGE FREEZES

as the TV show credits end

But before it fades out we see that something has changed in
this footage

The two Humans being vivisected on that gurney are different

The Doctor in surgical scrubs has Steven Prices face

His nurse is Evelyn

Pritchetts Voice heard as the image starts to fade
PRITCHETT (VO)

It wont stop until its got
every one --

THE END
