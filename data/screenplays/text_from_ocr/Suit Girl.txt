EXT DESERT - DAY

And a bright one

First day of a brutal summer

Sun beats down on a sandy wasteland

Inhospitable desolation in every direction

A lone little figure wanders down an aging highway

Dirty hair tiny frame wrapped in dull colorless

clothes a crummy jacket with black tee caked with dust

SUIT GIRL

A small sweetheart about fourteen years old with the
saddest eyes you’ve ever seen

She wipes the sweat off her brow and gazes into the
distance

The heat hammers her

She stumbles

Can’t keep going

Sound of an engine

She glances into the distance

A van appears over the horizon like a mirage
She winces It’s really there

Suit Girl takes off to the dirt and finds a place to
hide laying flat on the ground

She waits keeping her head down
The van effortlessly breezes past

She pokes her head out and watches the van disappear
the horizon

She checks that the coast is clear and pulls herself
of the ditch

Returns to the empty street

She huffs and starts trudging again

into

out
EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Worn-down but still running Rusting metal signs dangle
in the wind

Suit Girl approaches

She eyes the establishment

She passes an empty parked car State Troopers She
keeps a wide berth

INT GAS STATION MART - DAY

Door swings open Jingling bell

Suit Girl creeps in but stops in the doorway

She shuts her eyes Air conditioning overhead

She practically melts under it

GAS STATION ATTENDANT
Get out of the door

Suit Girl steps in and looks around

Two state troopers loiter near the front desk Suit Girl
avoids eye contact and makes a beeline for the back

She finds a water fountain Hits the button Water
sprays She starts drinking eagerly keeping an eye on
the troopers

Door jingles again

A young man enters College aged texting with one hand
decked in unremarkable clothes cheap sneakers leather
cuff on his wrist

His name is SAM He waves to the cashier

SAM
Hey I got twenty bucks on pump
two okay I’m going to look
around

Sam passes Suit Girl and smiles She wipes her mouth and
tries to wave back but he’s already looking away

Wall of freezers Suit Girl checks no one’s looking
then opens the door and shoves her face in
Sam pokes through some shelves and spots her He
approaches opens the neighboring door and shoves his
face in too

SAM (CONTD)
Smart

She grins They share a moment

Sam’s cell phone rings He pulls his head out hits a
button and begins one half of a conversation

SAM (CONTD)
Hey I’m still a couple hours
away I didn’t get out as early
as I thought
Suit Girl spies on him
SAM (CONTD)
I don’t know probably after dark
No no start without me I don’t
mind
She glances over to the pumps
SAM (CONTD)
Yeah I have my keys why wouldn’t
I have my keys

Suit Girl sneaks past the troopers and heads out

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Sam’s car Older than he is Four doors loaded with
stuff fading parking permits and dulled paint

Suit Girl approaches the old auto
She glances back to the store windows No one’s looking
She tests Sam’s doors Unlocked She opens the back

She slithers into Sam’s car nestling between random
belongings and shuts the door behind her

A second later Sam exits the market with a bag carrying
a six pack of soda with one finger

He opens his door tosses his bag into the passenger
seat

He takes the pump handle and starts filling his tank

Numbers start rolling up Reaches 20 in no time

He looks away from the car long enough to miss Suit Girl
resettling amongst his things

Sam places the pump back in the cradle

Screws the gas cap back on wipes his hands on his pants
and slips into the car

The door shuts
Ignition

The car drives off

EXTINT DESERTSAM’S CAR - DAY

Sam drops his cell phone into an empty cupholder

He drives bored

He pulls his visor down revealing a CD holder

Suit Girl peers out from behind the seat

He catches a fleeting glimpse of Suit Girl in the mirror
Sam glances back Nothing there

Shakes his head Never was

Back to the CDs He pulls one slides it into the
stereo

He looks back a second time Nothing

He pulls a soda can from the plastic rings and tosses it
gently into the back It bounces off Suit Girl’s head

SUIT GIRL
Ow
EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
Sams brakes scream the car skids to a stop
Sam bursts out the front door backing up nervously

He’s yards away before he calms down enough to actually
look back

He nervously approaches the car reaches for the back
door handle and flings the door open

Suit Girl slips out of the back wide eyes locked on Sam
SAM
What the hell are you doing in my
car

SUIT GIRL

I’m sorry I’m sorry

SAM
How did you even get back there

SUIT GIRL
I’m sorry

She briskly walks away avoiding eye contact with him
Dumbfounded and flustered Sam takes off after her

SAM
Hey HEY

He catches up to her He turns her around and crouches
to get a better look

SAM (CONTD)
Who are you where did you come
from

Suit Girl writhes out of his grasp and walks away

SAM (CONTD)
Wait

She stops and turns

SAM (CONT’D)
I remember you I remember you
you were in the gas station What
are you doing here

She stays quiet as he approaches her

SAM (CONTD)
Well okay you know what let’s
just let’s just call your
parents and tell ‘em what happened
and figure out a place where we

can--
SUIT GIRL
No
SAM
Look someone has to be looking
for you
SUIT GIRL

No one’s looking for me
SAM
God damn I gotta how the hell
do we find the police out here

SUIT GIRL
No No police Just don’t
okay

SAM
Why What did you do

SUIT GIRL
Nothing

Sam groans annoyed He crouches trying to think of what
to do Suit Girl nervously approaches him

SUIT GIRL (CONT’D)
Can I go now

SAM
Where are you going

SUIT GIRL
I don’t know

SAM

You don’t know

SUIT GIRL
I’1l know when I get there

Suit Girl steps away from him

He watches her walk away then takes stock of the desert
Wide hot empty No end in sight

He’s not even thinking when he blurts out

SAM
You want a ride

Suit Girl arches a brow suspicious

SAM (CONTD)
Look if you keep walking out
here dressed like that you’ll
probably get heat stroke or pass
out and die or something So
you want a ride

SUIT GIRL
A ride
SAM
Yeah And if you see where you’re
going I can drop you off

SUIT GIRL
Really

SAM
Sure

Suit Girl approaches Sam’s car inspecting the curves

SUIT GIRL
Okay

SAM
Uh I’m Sam by the way

She gives him a small angelic smile as she opens the car
door

SUIT GIRL
Hi

She shuts the door behind her
SAM
(to himself)
Hi ”
EXTINT DESERT SAM’S CAR - DAY
Sam shuts his door Suit Girl pulls her seatbelt on

They’re both glazed from the heat outside

SAM
Brutal out there

SUIT GIRL
Yeah

Suit Girl pulls her knees close

Sam puts the keys back in trying to think of what to
say

He glances at her shoes the treads dig into the seat
fabric

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
Sorry bad for the seat right
SAM
Don’t worry about it sit how you
like
Suit Girl clutches her legs tight
SAM (CONT’D)
Trust me this car’s taken a lot
more abuse than you could dish
out
She curls back up

Ignition kicks in

Sam reaches for the AC knob Suit Girl instinctively
tightens scooting away from his hand

She keeps her eyes on him
SAM (CONTD)
Um the air conditioning I was
turning on the air conditioning
She doesn’t move

Sam moves his hand away She keeps tight

SAM (CONTD)
I was just trying to

Sam groans

SAM (CONTD)
Forget it

Long silence Doesn’t sit well with either of them

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

Sams car glides down the empty desert

INT SAM’S CAR - DESERT - DAY

Suit Girl watches the desert pass

She adjusts in her seat Eyes on the horizon
Sam stares straight ahead One hand on the wheel

His attention drifts back to Suit Girl
SAM
(softly)
I can’t do this
He sits back

SAM (CONTD)
You thirsty

SUIT GIRL
Yeah

SAM
I uh got the wrong soda back
there Why don’t we find some
place to pull in get you
something to drink

Sams car parks in the almost-empty parking lot

INT MINIMART - DESERT - DAY

Sam and Suit Girl stride into the big crummy store Sam
tries to hide his face from the cameras

Sam nudges Suit Girl off

SAM
Go look around see what you want

SUIT GIRL
Okay

Suit Girl steps away from him
Sam starts poking around He keeps an eye on the door

Suit Girl glances about the shelves fingering through
plastic packets

Sam slowly creeps backwards inching towards the door
Suit Girl peels open a Smiley Pie shoving the whole

thing into her mouth crumbs of cake and filling dribble
down her cheek

MANAGER
Hey Gotta pay for that

She grabs another one and rushes towards the door

MANAGER (CONTD)
Hey Get your ass back here

Sam steps in front of her blocking her in

SAM

Stops Cake sticks out of her mouth

Sam gets in slamming the door
Suit Girl shrinks and glances at the wrapper

SUIT GIRL

Sam shifts the car into gear

SAM
No

She puts her finger against the cake and slowly pushes
the rest into her mouth

Sam drives
Tries to speak Can’t think of what to say
Suit Girl keeps to herself contorting in her seat
They ride in uncomfortable silence
SAM (CONTD)

Okay this this isn’t working

SAM
No no it’s just I think

way

SUIT GIRL
What do you mean

anything I do want to know but

Suit Girl nods Sam smiles
SAM (CONTD)
And relax a little okay I’m not
going to let anything happen to
you
Suit Girl meekly smiles back
She sits back in her seat Exhales
Sam unrolls his window
Suit Girl unrolls hers

She stretches in her seat seeing how far her little legs
can reach

Sam drums his fingers on the steering wheel
Suit Girl watches hint of affection in her eyes

She cranes her head back wind from her open window
rustles her hair

She sticks her hand out the window and watches it cut
through the air flying over the landscape whipping past

She wiggles her fingers red sunset peeks through

Sun sets over the purple-tinted desert

Sam lets Suit Girl into the dark house and carefully
shuts the door He steps out of his sneakers as Suit

She peers into dark rooms curiously touching anything in
front of her while Sam tosses his keys into a bowl

Sound of paws on hard wood A large dog eagerly
approaches the two

Soft She smiles lazily nuzzling it

Her eyes flitter barely for a second

Beat

Her eyes fly open Panic mode

She bolts up covers fly off she scrambles backwards

until she hits the wall behind her Her wide eyes survey
the room

Little fan whirs away on the nightstand Her pants and

Relief creeps onto her face but slowly turns to a
worrying concern

SUIT GIRL
Where am I

across a photo of Sam

A boy Suit Girl’s age sits casually slumped at the table
MITCH Attention on a small TV on the counter full
cereal bowl in his hand bare feet propped on another
chair oozing summer lethargy

Suit Girl trudges in lazily Startled at the sight of
the boy she accidently steps backwards into the wall

The clatter gets the boy’s attention He turns their
eyes lock

Suit Girl nervously raises a hand up

SUIT GIRL
Hi

Mitch nods Same smirk as Sam Suit Girl tries to smirk
back

MITCH

yelling upstairs

Girl with his foot Suit Girl just looks at the chair

nervously She quickly sits in the seat

MITCH (CONTD)
So you’re not a robber What are
you

Mitch pours her cereal then douses it with milk

SUIT GIRL
I’m no one What are you

He plops a spoon in it and carries it to the table

MITCH
I’m a philosopher

Mitch sinks back into his seat as Suit Girl winces
inspecting her cereal poking it with the spoon

SUIT GIRL
Really I never met a philosopher
before

Suit Girl lifts the spoon to her lips and tastes

Wugh

No good

Suit Girl starts picking bits from her cereal making a
pile on the table by her side

INT SAM’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
Sam throws his duffel bag onto the recliner

Suit Girl plops onto the bed and watches as Sam starts to
unpack Neither says anything

Mitch peers through the door frame

MITCH
Oh Saaaaam

SAM

Mitch grins whips out a large Nerf gun and starts
cranking shots

SAM (CONTD)
Dude come on not yet

Suit Girl watches with raised eyebrows

SAM (CONTD)

(acting)
Youre a philosopher A man of
peace
MITCH
To make peace you must prepare for
war

He produces a small ball Grenade Pulls the pin
tosses and ducks It bonks off Sam’s head

SAM
Oh you’re dead now bro

Sam throws a ball off his shelf at Mitch before reaching
under his bed He pulls out his own nerf gun and starts
firing back

Now it’s Mitch’s turn to shield himself

MITCH
Sam Come on

Sam hands the gun over to Suit Girl

SAM
Come on keep firing

Suit Girl positions herself between Sam and the gun and
starts pumping missiles

MITCH
Stop it

SAM
(to Suit Girl)
Tell him to say peanuts

SUIT GIRL
Say peanuts

MITCH
Okay peanuts peanuts

Sam and Suit Girl stop firing

Sam takes the gun presses the muzzle against Mitch’s
forehead

SAM

planted on the floor

One hand
He lifts one hand off the ground
MITCH (CONTD)
One hand Army guys can’t even do
this
Suit Girl appears next to him dangling upside down

He smiles at her She grins back

SUIT GIRL
How did you become a philosopher

MITCH
When I was ten we went toa
Chinese restaurant and got fortune
cookies at the end those folded
treats with paper inside They
all said different things little
pieces of wisdom And I looked at
all the other tables and all the
other cookies and realized they
ALL said different things and I
wanted to read ‘em all

SUIT GIRL
Uh-huh

Her hands rest on her belly

MITCH
I was askin’ dad every day to take
us back we ate so much rice an’
curry we got sick I don’t even
like the stuff

Sam walks in He sees them and sits upside down off an
opposite chair

MITCH (CONTD)
Anyway once dad figured out why I
wanted to go he bought me this
book on Chinese proverbs and
sayings he said that’s where all
the fortune cookies came from

SUIT GIRL

Suit Girl stands approaches the table and sits

CLAIRE

SUIT GIRL

CLAIRE
It’s okay

The family sits and unceremoniously starts eating

Suit Girl makes sure everyone else has begun then
shovels food into her face

One by one the family stops and just starts watching her
inhale her dinner

CLAIRE (CONTD)
You should slow down

She doesn’t Claire reaches over and holds Suit Girl’s
arm The kid stops

CLAIRE (CONTD)
(assertively)
Don’t eat so fast

They stare at each other Claire moves her hand away

After the briefest of pauses Suit Girl resumes as fast
as before

Claire groans
SAM
You really should slow down
Youll get sick if you keep eating
like that

Suit Girl looks at Sam then down at her food then
slowly resumes eating

Claire sighs and pokes at her own food with her fork
The family eats in silence

Suit Girl reaches for her water and drinks half the cup
in one gulp

CLAIRE
Do you want some more water

Suit Girl continues eating She takes a roll and tears
it apart with her teeth disemboweling it

Mitch grins watching her amused
Claire fights back a scowl Not amused

SAM
Pass me the rolls please

Suit Girl takes the plate of rolls and hands them over

SAM (CONTD)

Mitch stops eating

CLAIRE (CONTD)

Suit Girl leaves silently

The table stays silent Claire begins to eat again

Eventually Sam and Mitch join

But if you DID ask If you
gave it lots of thought and you
absolutely decided that was what
you wanted I’1ll do whatever I
can to help you

SUIT GIRL
Thanks
INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
Suit Girl lies in window box
She pushes off her blanket with a huff
She turns on her side resettling

She reaches her arm out wrapping it around thin air
pretending a person is there

She slowly pulls the invisible figure close She ends
with her arms wrapped around herself

She opens her eyes for just a moment
SUIT GIRL
(softly)
Good night Sam

She holds herself tight

INT SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM - MORNING
Shower Steam

Sam groans craning his sore neck
Gauze wrapped around his wrist

Curtain flies open Suit Girl stands there eyes open in
surprise

A beat Sam covers himself Suit Girl turns surprise
still on her face Sam pulls the curtain shut

EXT PERRY HOUSE - DAY

The cars are gone

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Suit Girl and Mitch sit upside down in the chairs Mitch
holds the remote Keeps hitting the button

Channels jump on the screen Daytime programming
Garbage

Mitch looks over to Suit Girl Both visibly bored
sweaty listless

MITCH
You wanna see something
EXT PERRY HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
Suit Girl stands against the house

Mitch sets a 2 liter plastic coke bottle on the ground
He carefully opens a package of Mentos

He pulls off a long strip of sticky tape and lines Mentos
down the line Sticks the tape over

He’s methodical like a bomb disposal expert

Teetering on his feet he drops the strip in and runs
away

The bottle bursts Aquatic explosion Soda spouts into
the air

Bottle knocks aside sprays in a hard circle
Both kids are hit Can’t stop laughing

MITCH
Oh DAMN

SUIT GIRL
This is so gross

Suit Girl tries to wipe the soda off her skin Mitch
nabs the hose and kicks the valve

Water spurts from the loose connection Hose bursts to
life Mitch thumbs the stop and sprays Suit Girl

She squeals with glee
Mitch chases Suit Girl with the hose
Suit Girl trips on the bottle lands on her butt

Mitch rushes up to her She takes the bottle and shoves
it pouring the remaining drink in his face

The running hose hits the ground

She grabs it turns it on Mitch He slips and hits the
ground too

MITCH
Peanuts peanuts

He wallows through the mud trying to reach the faucet

He keeps slipping

Suit Girl keeps laughing with him

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
High speed creaking and rattling of a big metal fan
Mitch and Suit Girl gaze through the whipping blades

They lie on their backs on a towel Still soaked Most
of the mud scraped off Wet clothes cling to their skin

The fan Creaking Rattling Whirring Loud
Strangely peaceful

Bare arms touch

Mitch glances over Suit Girl shuts her eyes and cranes
her neck taking in the fan’s artificial breeze

He studies her profile Nose lips chin neck All
slick

He nervously swallows Never been this close to a girl

He looks away Tents his fingers on his chest Closes
his eyes Breathes out his nose Meditation mode

Suit Girl’s eyes stay locked on the whirring fan She’s
in another world

Then snaps back into ours laughing her ass off
Giggling to the point of tears

Bexley is licking at the grass stuck to her feet

She curls up into a ball laughing trying not to kick
the dog

She beckons Bexley closer and sits up She scratches him
affectionately

Mitch rolls away

SUIT GIRL
Hey Bexley

She sighs as she strokes his wet fur

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
You smell a little

MITCH
(through fan)
Sooco dooooo youuuu

Suit Girl looks back Sees Mitch grinning through the
metal blades She crouches down to match

SUIT GIRL
What are you doing

MITCH
(modulating voice)
Talking through the fan It
changes your voice I sound like
a robot

SUIT GIRL
(imitating)
Helllllooooo Mitch When do Sam
and Claire come home

MITCH
(modulating voice)
Are you bored

SUIT GIRL
No This is much better with
someone else Do you want to do
anything

Mitch leans in He watches her run her finger between
her lips She bites her bottom lip bored

Mitch’s focus changes from her to the steel blades
between them

He looks away

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
Mitch You know how to read

MITCH
Yeah

SUIT GIRL
Show me

MITCH
Now

She eagerly nods

INT LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Mitch and Suit Girl lie on their sides heads resting on
each other’s legs

Mitch pours over Tezuka’s “Phoenix” while Suit Girl
struggles to read an illustrated “20000 Leagues”

SUIT GIRL
(reading stilted)
The year 1 8 6 6 was marked by a
strange uck-uhr-ensie Seveeral
ships had repurted sigg-ting an
“enor-moose thing”

Mitch follows her eyes on the page

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)

MITCH
Um “phos-phor-sent”

SAM
Well I’m sick of you implying that
I’m a fucking idiot

CLAIRE

say in her well being the second
we stepped into this house And

happens I’m out of here for good

CLAIRE
Right another great decision
You going to pay for school by

CLAIRE
Sometimes he can just be a thick-
headed idiot but I love him I
can’t help it

SUIT GIRL
You’d scream like that at someone

CLAIRE
I shouldn’t I mean there’s a
difference between screaming and
hate I don’t hate him but I
have to get through his thick
skull sometimes you know

SUIT GIRL
Where’s he going

SUIT GIRL
You wanna be alone

SAM
We can be alone together

Suit Girl wanders into the room
SUIT GIRL
Never been alone together before
Sounds better

Suit Girl closes the door

SAM
Alone together we don’t have to
explain ourselves to anyone but we
don’t have to be lonely while we

SUIT GIRL
I hate being lonely and I hate
explaining myself

Suit Girl flops onto her back on the bed The two
converse without looking at each other

Mitch gets up and silently walks to his room

Suit Girl curls up on the sill
Mitch glances back at her

MITCH
Hey still feel like crap at one

SUIT GIRL
Why

Mitch cracks a grin and steps into his room

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Mitch anxiously looks through the freezer Visible
breath pours from his mouth

MITCH
Nothing Not even a Fudgesicle
Where does all that grocery money
go

Mitch opens the fridge Suit Girl tries to peer over his
shoulder

Mitch pulls a paper towel off a bowl

MITCH (CONTD)
Bread rolls That’s not dessert

Suit Girl takes one and tries to bite Too hard

MITCH (CONTD)
Eggs ketchup cream cheese

Suit Girl peers over his shoulder

SUIT GIRL
What’s that

MITCH
Stale and gross

Mitch shuts the fridge door Kitchen goes dark except
for one plug-in night light

MITCH (CONT’D)
Maybe we could just do chips or

SUIT GIRL
It’s okay Mitch I’m not that
hungry

MITCH

stomach

SUIT GIRL

She wraps her hands around his shoulders and holds him
SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
You can still solve your problems

jealous
Mitch’s heart sinks his arms drop He rests his chin on
her shoulder and lets her hold him
INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAWN
Suit Girl sleeps in the window box

She tenses up Hands grab at her belly

She’s sweating Light panting Enough to pull her from
her slumber

She groggily rouses with a loud gurgle

She moans She clutches her belly tight

Sharp pain right in the gut She clutches herself

She rolls off her flat little cushion and rushes to the
bathroom

INT SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM - DAWN

Suit Girl locks the door flips the lid up and sits on
the toilet Briefs hit her ankles

She gasps half-awake She groans and strains
She closes her watering eyes
SUIT GIRL
(softly)
Oh god oh god oh god oh god

She exhales with a shudder her hands clutch the side of
the tub and the wall She grimaces gritting her teeth

Pain Massive
Her little legs jerk uncontrollably

She tries to breathe normally She can’t

She pants Can’t keep it steady

She exhales hard A long empty groan

She cringes tears streaming from her eyes
Still making that low unholy sound

It slowly dies away Her body relaxes

She wipes her sweaty face panting like a marathon
runner

She stands slips her briefs back on and looks into the
bowl

She’s horrified by what she sees
But just for a second

Her hand holds her stomach again the cupping gesture
slipping into a flat hand against her belly She
breathes a sigh of relief

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
Oh god

Both hands lie flat on her stomach She starts to tear
up again but manages a weak smile

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
Oh thank god

She slides to the ground and holds herself arms crossed
against her belly

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
Thank god thank god thank god
thank god

She stands up again and approaches the toilet She
glances in again She shudders at the sight

SUIT GIRL (CONT’D)
I’m sorry Poor thing You poor
poor poor poor thing

She nervously reaches for the handle

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
Please flush please flush

She tilts the handle down Watery whoosh Suit Girl
watches the bowl empty and sighs with relief

She keeps a hand flat on her belly and runs the sink
splashing water on her face She catches her reflection

and presses her cheek against it
SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
It’s okay now you’re okay now
It’s all over my little dove

She kisses her reflection lovingly

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)

Now he really is gone Every last

She touches her reflection Studying it

She yanks his wrist out revealing a big ugly stitch

right over his vein
Suicide scar Claire almost goes white

CLAIRE
It’s not nothing what is this

I want you to talk to someone
about this

SAM
I don’t want to I don’t want to

CLAIRE
You can’t just try to forget this

SAM

I don’t want to think about it

the second that blade pushed
through the skin it was like an
electric shock back into reality

CLAIRE
Sam you’ve been in a bad place
for months I can barely see you
when I look in your eyes how can
I trust you that you won’t try
something that stupid again

SAM
Cause it scared the shit out of
me And as lousy and as worthless
as I feel it’s nothing compared
to the pure dread and adrenaline
once I started bleeding

CLAIRE
You tried to ki-

MITCH (0S)
You tried to kill yourself

Sam and Claire turn Mitch hangs in the door frame

SAM
Mitch--

Mitch approaches Sam Angry flushed

SAM (CONTD)
I’m so sorry brother--

CLAIRE
Wait for us outside Mitch--

He doesn’t listen to either of them All he does is wrap
his arms around his older brother

Everyone stays silent

MITCH
Promise me you’ll never do that
again

SAM

I wont

MITCH
Promise me you’ll never feel
worthless or lousy again

SAM
I can’t promise something like
that

MITCH

Youre not So you don’t have any
reason to feel that way

Mitch takes a look at Sam’s mutilated wrist

MITCH (CONTD)
That’s it This frightened you

Sam nods

MITCH (CONTD)
You’re a total wuss

Sam grins

COMMUNAL BONFIRE - NIGHT

A gathering held in a wide open space Cars clutter the
outer edge and people gather around tables as a large
bonfire is stoked

Suit Girl steps onto the grass Simple white dress just
beyond vintage

She likes it tries to keep it billowing as she walks

She glances to the ground Her plain bare feet step
through the grass

Sam smiles watching Suit Girl wade towards the
gathering

He glances at his wrist Leather cuff
Mitch wanders up behind him

MITCH
Mutilated for life huh

SAM
This is just so simple

MITCH
The really funny thing about
wisdom is that once you get the
hang of it it’s really simple

SAM
Youre too young to be wise

MITCH
What am I old enough to be

SAM
A smart-ass Go have fun

Mitch scampers off eager to join the fun Claire
follows

SAM (CONTD)
You gonna look around

SUIT GIRL
Yeah will you be okay

SAM
Yeah just gonna walk around

to spot me

SUIT GIRL
And youll be able to spot me

She turns in her dress
SAM
(teasing)
You big flirt

He rustles her hair and walks away

Suit Girl smiles and starts wading through the dispersed
crowd

Families bonding friends talking plastic cups and hand-
held refreshments

There’s already litter on the floor She carefully steps
around it and accidently steps into Cassie

CASSIE
Hey watch it

Suit Girl looks up
CASSIE (CONT’D)

ELIZABETH

I know now this is still a

little rough so go easy on me

clears her throat

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(on the fly)
“Once there was a girl so lame
she made everyone want to hurl
and she never said her name so we
call her Suit Girl”

cackle
sneers and walks off

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Come on back we’re just teasing
you Can’t you take a joke
stops and turns

SUIT GIRL
How can you be so mean Mitch

if you’re all so terrible

ELIZABETH
Mitch is such a queer

SUIT GIRL
-he’s a philosopher

ELIZABETH
Exactly

CASSIE

That’s so gay
Suit Girl keeps walking
The girls scoff and head off in the opposite direction
ON SAM
Sam passes the fireside examining his leather cuff
White handwriting on the back He reads it
SAM
“Well always love you Mitch

He smirks
SAM (CONTD)
I could stand to see this every

into her hand and grasps her arms

SLEAZY 16

SUIT GIRL

He pulls close to her

SLEAZY 16
If you want I’11 let you sit on
my lap

SUIT GIRL
No thanks

She slips out of his hold and walks away

Sleazy 16 tosses an ice cube against her leg and she
slips drink hits her in the face and she stumbles she
hits the ground

Sleazy 16 grins proud of himself

She groans and stands Grass stains and punch smeared
down her front

Sleazy 16 approaches and offers his hand She swats
angrily at it and pulls herself up

Sleazy 16 cops a feel of her ass She slaps him

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
You ruined my dress

She slaps him again Sleazy 16 shields his face
Her slapping gets attention
Elizabeth’s mother grabs her wrist

ELIZABETH’S MOTHER
What’s going on

SLEAZY 16
She’s nuts I tried to help her up
and she started hitting me I
mean she’s a girl I can’t hit
her back

ELIZABETH’S MOTHER

Sleazy 16 winks at Suit Girl and walks off proudly

SUIT GIRL
He made me trip and ruined my

ON ELIZABETH

ELIZABETH
Oh my god she’s holding hands
with Mitch’s yummy brother

CASSIE
Maybe he’s got a thing for whiny
skinny sluts

ELIZABETH
Bet she goes down on him only
reason someone his age would stick
around with her

CASSIE
Oh my god she does How else

They cackle proud of themselves not realizing that a
crushed Mitch has been listening the whole time

MITCH

EXT TOWN STREET - NIGHT

Lights are out Practically a ghost town cloaked in
night

Suit Girl wanders under sickly streetlamp glow

She catches her reflection in an empty storefront Face
flushed eyes puffy nose red

SUIT GIRL
I hate you

Her reflection talks back

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
I hate you so much You don’t
deserve Sam after everything you
did to him You’re a stupid
little fucking fool just like
everyone said
She glares at her reflection seething with rage

SUIT GIRL (CONTD)
You cost me every chance I ever
get at happiness And I don’t
want to be you anymore

PARK - HILL - NIGHT

Suit Girl wanders off the barely-lit path into the dark

Grass crinkles underfoot She wanders out and plops down

on an arbitrary spot

She pulls her arms out of her jacket sleeves turning it

into a blanket and wraps it close around her
Sam approaches her

SAM
Can I sit

She nods Sam sits next to her

SUIT GIRL
There’s no stars

SAM
Light pollution

SUIT GIRL
In the desert at night there were
a buncha stars It was cold but
it was pretty

SAM
Well this is ugly but lukewarm
And kinda humid

SUIT GIRL
Feels like the flu
SAM
Yeah it does never thought of
that
SUIT GIRL
-why did you help me
SAM
Are you mad
SUIT GIRL

No maybe just why did you
help me

SAM
Cause I’m a screw up I can’t
help but do the wrong thing

SUIT GIRL
That’s my excuse Not yours

SAM
Let me tell you a story A couple
years ago before I headed off to
college I was supposed to pick up
Mitch from the Y I didnt I
was getting wasted with a couple
friends

SUIT GIRL
Wasted

SAM
I wasn’t a drug addict or
anything it was just something I
did every once in a while
Anyway Mitch had to walk home
and not ten minutes in these
older kids real tough guys
jumped him and robbed him They
beat him up yanked his shirt off
smashed his phone took his cash
and stole his sneakers

Suit Girl leans in

SAM (CONTD)
And you know what could he do
He walked the whole way home
twelve miles barefoot in the
middle of summer He almost
burned the bottom of his feet off

Sam adds in a small impressed laugh

SAM (CONTD)
I cant believe he actually
forgave me He didnt blame me
he wasn’t even MAD at me he was
so cool it kinda broke my
heart you know

SUIT GIRL
Wow

SAM
If I ever had any doubts that I
was a shithead that
SUIT GIRL
You’re not a shithead Sam I
know a ton and you’re not like
‘em

SAM
Thanks

SUIT GIRL
Is that your big dark secret

SAM
Not even close But it’s probably
the most important one

SUIT GIRL
You need to know an important one

SAM
I already know a big important
one

SUIT GIRL
You know

SAM
Mom told me About

SUIT GIRL
I’m so sorry Sam

SAM
No I’m sorry She’s sorry too
she started telling me and burst
into tears I am so sorry that
you were so desperate and couldn’t
tell us I’m so sorry that you
had to endure that alone
especially when we were all so
close by

SUIT GIRL
I don’t belong with you

SAM
You belong with people who care
about you who worry about you
who get scared when you’re lost
and alone in a strange place

SUIT GIRL
Id fuck it up again

SAM
If they care about you it won’t
matter Take it froma
professional fuck-up

SUIT GIRL
How will I know if they care about
me

Two sets of legs appear behind them
CLAIRE (0S)

They’11 insist on coming after you
in the middle of the night even
though every fiber of their being
tells them they shouldn’t

Sam and Suit Girl turn in surprise

Claire approaches Mitch lags a step behind

Sam rises Suit Girl follows

Mitch rushes up and clutches Suit Girl tightly She
returns the hug

Claire draws Suit Girl away from Mitch Sam holds his
brother’s shoulders as the two ladies share a private
moment

SUIT GIRL
You told him

CLAIRE
Yeah

SUIT GIRL

And you cried
Claire kneels in front of her

CLAIRE
When you told me I was so mad
because I was so frightened for
Sam for what could have happened
to him and when I told him all
I could think about was you
being that scared that hopeless
that alone and to be so little
to have no one to confide in or to
cry to

SUIT GIRL
You want me to cry to you

CLAIRE
I want you to stop doing stupid
things out of fear I want you to
stop being afraid And I want to
tell you

She clutches Suit Girl

CLAIRE (CONTD)

Releases the imaginary hand

She opens her eyes and watches the sun disappear
She’s left alone in the growing dark

MONTAGE

Suit Girl’s first day at school

MITCH (VO)
Philosopher Joseph Campbell said
“Before you create you must
destroy” Suit Girl did destroy
our family but she helped build a
better one

Suit Girl chattering to her friends They can’t get a
word in edgeways

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Don’t think it was a happy ending
though There were bad times

Sam in group therapy Chats up a girl during the break

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Rough times We would fuck up
the simplest things

Sam and Claire scream at each other

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
But we would sometimes get the big
things right

Suit Girl and Mitch have more midnight snacks

MITCH (VO) (CONT’D)
There was heartbreak

Suit Girl A handsome boy her age Her real first kiss

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Some missteps

Mitch with his friends One offers him a beer He tries
it Makes him sick

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Yelling screaming

Claire flirts with a gentleman her age

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Crying

Family gathered over Bexley’s grave

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Hugging laughing

Surprise party for Suit Girl Streamers noisemakers
the whole nine yards

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
It was good it was hard it was
painful But life is like that
Sam sweeps Suit Girl off her feet

Later Party has died down Mitch takes a handful of
leftover cake

MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
That one was mine Someone else
mighta said it but I said it from
experience
Sam dozes off on the sofa
Suit Girl curls up next to him
MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Oh and Suit Girl was wrong The
bad is only there to make sure
when we’re happy it feels so much
better
She plants her head on his shoulder and falls asleep
Sam rouses just enough to notice her there
He smiles softly then falls back asleep
MITCH (VO) (CONTD)
Rookie mistake But that’s okay
She’s still young

Mitch plops down next to Sam and lies against him He
cozies up and rests his eyes

Claire enters

She plants a kiss on each of their heads

She leans over and switches off each of the lamps
The room darkens in steps until the screen
Finally

Goes black

THE END
