1 OUTSIDE COUNTRY HOUSE - EXT NIGHT

An ancient house standing lonely in the middle of a deserted
landscape in Northern Germany lying there like a sleeping
giant under the starry sky

But something seems strange All of the windows and doors have
been nailed shut

Text chart 1976

The headlights of a car pierce the darkness A car halts in
the yard Three MEN step out One of them is wearing a police
uniform The men switch on their flashlights and look around

MAN 1
How long has the house already been
like this

KARL LINDNER a keen police officer in his late thirties
approaches the entrance door He speaks in a calm hoarse
voice

LINDNER
No idea I havent seen them in
weeks

Lindner makes himself a picture of the situation

He rings the doorbell Nothing stirs inside the house Then
he tries to get a look inside through one of the nailed-shut
windows

Through the cracks he can barely make out a faint pulsating
light

LINDNER
I havent seen them in weeks

The three men exchange looks
With a heavy heart Lindner makes his decision

LINDNER
Were going in

The third man fetches a crowbar and prepares to open the door
with it

2 ENTRANCE AREA COUNTRY HOUSE - INT NIGHT

The house door breaks open with a loud crack

On the floor below the mail slot there are piles of mail and
unread newspapers which the door pushes out of the way as it
opens

The three men cautiously enter They look around The hallway
is as dark as night Lindner tries the light switch - nothing
The only light comes from a TV-set running in the living room

3 LIVING ROOM - INT NIGHT

The three of them enter the living room Disgusted the first
man holds a handkerchief to his mouth

MAN 1
Pooh what a stench

There is a massive armchair in the center of the room in front
of the television - There seems to be someone sitting in it
In the darkness we cannot recognize who it is

Lindner carefully steps closer

The second man stops in front of a large dark stain on the
wall He touches it draws back his hand and inspects it -
blood

Lindner slowly walks around the armchair

LINDNER
My God Marlene

During the next flicker of light from the television we
recognize the corpse of a woman around forty years of age

Suddenly Lindner hears something behind him - breathing
He turns around

Indeed hidden in the semi-darkness there is the shadow of a
figure squatting on the floor

LINDNER
Frank Hell what happened in
here
Lindner carefully approaches the figure

It is a man FRANK KOSINSKI He looks scrawny all skin and
bones with a pale and hollow face

He doesnt pay the least attention to Lindner Mesmerized he
just stares at the dead woman in the armchair

The first man follows the direction the man is looking in
and takes a careful look at the dead woman Something seems to

be irritating him

MAN 1
Now thats really odd

MAN 2
What What is it

MAN 1
Id say she drowned

Lindner leans over to the lethargic man in the shadows

LINDNER

He gently touches his shoulder At the same moment Kosinski
seems to snap out of it

He begins to scream in wild panic - loud heartrending

4 TITLE SEQUENCE
A photo montage of corpses preserved in the swamps over
hundreds and thousands of years children old people
warriors farmers with hair stained red from the humin acid
bony extremities and shriveled faces with skin that resembles
an ancient landscape

FADE TO
5 LANDSCAPE OF SWAMPS IN NORTHERN GERMANY - EXT DAY

The structures of the corpses skin fade into pictures of a
vast landscape of heaths forests and moors

An expensive offroad vehicle is leading a sports car along a
deserted country road Its a wonderful late-summers day
The two cars take a bend

6 OUTSIDE COUNTRY HOUSE - EXT DAY

into the driveway of the same old house It lies
peacefully in the afternoon sun The gravel crunches
underneath the tires

A large moving truck is already parked outside
Title chart 23 years later
7 OFFROAD VEHICLE - INT DAY

Driving the Jeep is ELLEN STRAUB an attractive self-assured
woman of approx 30 years

Asleep on the passengers seat beside her is her husband
MARTIN who in no way resembles the clich√© of the successful
author - he has a rather boyish charisma and is a bit too
attractive

Ellen stops the car and takes out some house keys She holds
them right up to her sleeping husbands ear Then she shakes
them They tinkle

ELLEN
(playful)
Sir we have arrived at your
residence

Martin blinks and takes the keys

MARTIN
Thank you James

The two of them step out of the car
8 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT DAY

Also getting out of their sports car are PAUL - a dynamic
looking man in his mid-forties - and his wife CLAUDIA Despite
their careful choice of casual dress they still look like the
epitome of snobbish city people

They take a look around Time has left its marks on the old
house Like an enchanted castle it is camouflaged in waist-
high grass and wildly ranking shrubs

Paul and Claudia exchange skeptic looks

PAUL
Well look here

MARTIN
Ladies and gentlemen The Straub
country-residence

CLAUDIA
It looks more like the Straub
ruins

PAUL
Welcome to the far end of the
world

Ellen contradicts
ELLEN
The lap of nature Wheres your
famous optimism

Two REMOVAL MEN climb out of the truck One of them is still
chewing on his lunch
He points at his watch as he addresses Martin

REMOVAL MAN
Lunch break is til one oclock

MARTIN
(sarcastic)
Sure take your time
(to Ellen)
They get a lunch break before they
even start working
Cool job

Laughing the four of them enter the house
9 ENTRANCE AREA - INT DAY

They step into the entrance area The golden sunlight shines
in stripes through the shutters The house is old monumental
One senses the centuries

A staircase leads upstairs the rooms on the first floor are
the kitchen and living room A heavy wooden door opens to the
cellar stairs

MARTIN
The country residence offers
everything the doctor ordered for a
stressed author needs fresh air
clean water and - most of all -
absolute peace and quiet

Paul walks upstairs The staircase creaks

PAUL
This wood is pretty decayed Hope
I dont land a floor lower

ELLEN
Although it would give you a
perfect opportunity to visit our
new wine cellar

CLAUDIA
How old is this shack anyway

ELLEN
Four hundred years Come on Ill
give you a tour of the museum
(blinking an eye at Martin and
Paul)
-while our husbands already get
to work
CUT TO
10 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT DAY

Martin and Paul are lugging a heavy desk out of the truck As
opposed to the two removal men they are really working hard

PAUL
Damn this thing is heavy Where do
you want to have it

MARTIN
Tenth floor

PAUL
Very funny

CUT TO
11 STUDY - INT DAY

Sweating Martin and Paul are trying to push the desk through
the narrow door to the study They are doing a pretty awkward
job of it

Martins hand brushes the door frame - a splinter

MARTIN
Shit

Martin draws back his hand Hes hurt

PAUL
Whats the matter

Martin presses a handkerchief on the wound and has a closer
look at the door frame

It is totally splintered as if someone had forcefully broken
the door open

MARTIN
Look at this The lock is totally
demolished

PAUL

I guess someone lost their key
You did get your tetanus shots I
hope

Martin is still looking at the broken lock
MARTIN
I mean seriously It is strange

isnt it

Paul puts it off Only now does he have a better look around
the room

PAUL
So what if it is There hasnt
been anyone in this house for at
least ten years

The study is covered with dust the walls are stained and full
of cobwebs - blind high arched windows Single pieces of
furniture that the previous owner left behind in this spacious
room

MARTIN
Twenty-three to be exact

PAUL
I wonder how you guys figure on
renovating this whole place You
can afford to spend some money If
I was you Id spare myself all the
hard work Besides didnt you
want to start writing again

Martin suddenly seems lost in thought

MARTIN
Yeah sure I will Give me a little
more time

Paul gives him a downcast look

PAUL

If you throw away your career that
wont change anything either Now
dont get me wrong but Im telling
you this as your friend Your last
books were awful The publishing
house isnt even sure whether to
extend your contract

Martin takes the handkerchief from his wound and looks at it

MARTIN
I dont care about my career right
now Paul Ellen and I need to get
our minds on other things first
After everything weve been
through

12 KITCHEN - INT DAY

Ellen is dragging a moving carton full of dishes into the
kitchen It seems to be very heavy Claudia hooks up a radio
and switches it on We hear a cheerful oldie (Life could be a
Dream)

The song seems to bring back memories to Ellen She stares at
the radio
(Transformation from radio to)
13 DINING ROOM OF CITY APARTMENT - INT DAY

Flashback

Ellen Martin and their son THOMAS (8 years old) are joined at
the breakfast table The radio is on - its playing the same
tune

The little boy is totally absorbed with his Game-boy

Martin sets a bowl of cornflakes and fresh fruit on the table

MARTIN
Here partner A breakfast for
champions

The little boy rolls his eyes and turns back to his Game-boy

THOMAS
I cant right now Im about to
break the high-score

Ellen gets into the discussion

ELLEN
You do that But first eat your
breakfast Tommi

Now Thomas reacts He puts the Game-boy on the table
He continues the game with one hand while he obediently
shovels the breakfast cereal into his mouth with the other

MARTIN
Goes to show again whos in command
around here

Martin gives Ellen a playful pat on the behind and kisses her
ELLEN
(joking)
Sometimes I get the feeling you
only love me for my body

Martin grins

MARTIN
Why else

ELLEN
Come on say it You know

Martin seems to know exactly what Ellen wants to hear
MARTIN

Oh no not again I just said it
for you last week
For a moment the two of them stop paying attention to their
son Suddenly Thomas grabs his throat He swallowed wrong
He chokes without making a sound

ELLEN
Say it anyway Come on how much
do you love me

MARTIN
(quotes)
With you my life began
and with you shall it end

Ellen gives him her most beautiful smile Martin responds with
a short kiss

At the same time they hear the Game-boy fall to the floor It
immediately draws their attention to Thomas

The little boy is desperately gasping for air His face is
already starting to turn blue

Martin runs to him

MARTIN
Tommi whats the matter

He pats Thomas on the back attempting to clear his throat

ELLEN
What is it Whats wrong with him

Thomas coughs choking but he cant get his throat clear
Martin recognizes the situation

MARTIN
(yells)
This is serious Quick call
emergency

Ellen hurries to the phone

Martin realizes that hitting Thomas back is not doing any
good He uses his finger to try to get the swallowed piece out
of his sons throat

For Thomas it is a battle against death

Ellen has gotten through to the emergency line She speaks
into the phone with distress

ELLEN
This is Straub You have to come
fast My son he swallowed
something Quick hes choking to
death

Martins attempts at helping his son remain futile Thomas is
beginning to lose conscience

Martin sweeps the table free of dishes in a single move and
lays the little boy down flat He reaches for a sharp fruit
knife

Ellen comes running

ELLEN
What are you doing

Martin holds the tip of the knife to the boys throat Its
not easy since his son is wildly kicking around himself

MARTIN
I have to cut his windpipe

ELLEN
(horrified)
Youre not a doctor youll hurt
him
MARTIN
(screams)
What else should I do damn it
hes dying

Again Martin prepares to cut - he holds the knife to the
larynx The boys movements grow weaker

ELLEN
Too high youre way too far up
you have to cut here

She points at the spot below the larynx while holding her
little son tight

MARTIN
Ellen move aside

ELLEN
Oh God Tommi

Martin prepares to cut but he cant - his trembling hand
refuses to move Endless seconds pass The voices blur like
in a dream The music playing on the radio seems to become
louder and louder (Life could be a Dream)

ELLEN
Whats the matter Come on cut

Martin looks up at his wife He cant do it

CLAUDIA (0OS)
Ellen

14 KITCHEN - INT DAY
Ellen starts

CLAUDIA
Ellen are you alright

Claudia has already started unpacking the carton

Ellen quickly switches the radio off She tries to act as if
nothing happened

ELLEN
Im fine I was just distracted
for a moment

Claudia notices how upset her friend is and wants to put her
arm around Ellens shoulder

But just then the removal men push their way past them with a
cupboard

Claudia drops the issue with a look of sympathy
CUT TO
15 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT DUSK

The old house is resting peacefully in the sunset The last
rays of sunlight paint the horizon orange Warm light shines
out through the windows of the house

16 KITCHEN - INT NIGHT

The four friends are joined at the dinner table surrounded by
packing cartons Their shadows are silhouetted outside the
large window Behind them lie the vast lonely moors

Martin opens himself a beer raises it for a toast

MARTIN
To our hard-working wives

CLAUDIA
Dont rejoice too soon The bill
is already on its way

They toast with their bottles Ellen takes herself a
cigarette Martin notices it with disapproval

CLAUDIA
I still cant picture it The two
of you as country folk Im
telling you in six weeks youll be
back in the city

PAUL
Hold it right there I hate to
play the big boss but as Martins
publisher I can only say Make the
best of the peace and quiet the
fresh air and all that - and write
a new masterpiece

Ellen gives Martin a skeptical look - the moment of silence is
almost too long

MARTIN
First things first Now its our

turn - just the two of us

Martins hand wanders over to Ellens She reacts a bit
hesitantly at first but then they hold each other tight

CUT TO

17 BATHROOM - INT NIGHT

Ellen is taking a shower washing off the dirt from a hard
days work

The bathroom fills with steam

Ellen turns off the water faucet and steps out of the shower
cabin She reaches for a towel and wraps it around herself

Something catches her eye in the fogged-up mirror

There is a number as if someone had used a finger to write it
into the moisture 7

She wipes the mirror clean and looks at it

FADE TO

18 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT DAY

The following day

A warm late-summers morning The house stands lonely in the
rays of the rising sun Occasional dew drops glitter in the
grass

19 BEDROOM - INT DAY

Ellen is asleep in her bed despite the sun shining right in
her face

Martin enters the room with a tray loaded with breakfast
delicacies He holds it under Ellens nose

MARTIN
(acting gallant)
Wake up wake up its break of
day Paul and Claudia have
already left you sleepyhead

Ellen hides under her blanket Martin sets down the tray

MARTIN
Youre right Forget about getting
up Well have breakfast in bed

Ellen resurfaces with a grin She is still sleepy
Martin jumps into bed and crawls under the blanket

ELLEN
How romantic

He playfully burrows around under the blanket making silly
grunting sounds
Ellen giggles Suddenly Martin sticks his head out

ELLEN
(laughing)
Stop that
MARTIN

(with a grunting voice)
Youll never get away from me

He grabs her and pulls her under the blanket Ellen screams
and laughs

20 STUDY - INT DAY

Martin is working at his computer Everything is still set up
a bit provisionally Only Martins novels have already been
sorted into a shelf with 10 copies of Cherry-red Tears in
front

He is trying to write but by the look on his face and his
hesitant typing we can tell that its obviously not going so
well

Ellen carefully approaches him from behind hugs him and gives
him a kiss on the cheek

ELLEN
So how does it feel to be kissed
by two women

MARTIN
They say its fantastic At least
thats what I read in a mens
magazine So who are the two lucky
ones

ELLEN
Me and the muse of course How is
your book coming along

He grins and takes her in his arms
MARTIN

Oh the muse were still having
our differences You know how it
is with women

ELLEN
Well then I guess Id better leave
the two of you alone But dont
forget

Martin finishes her thought

MARTIN
we wanted to take some time out
for ourselves I know And Ill
only work a little while I
promise

Just as Ellen prepares to leave she catches sight of an old
photograph lying on top of one of the cartons She picks it up
and takes the dust off of it

Under the dust she finds an old black and white picture of a
couple with very earnest looks The retouched pitch-black
eyes give the photo a somewhat eerie touch

All of a sudden unexpectedly the man on the photo turns his
head

His dead eyes look straight at Ellen

Startled she drops the picture to the floor

Martin spins around

MARTIN
Whats the matter

Ellen hesitantly picks up the picture and looks at it again
It was only her imagination It is a normal old black and

white photo

ELLEN
(irritated)
Oh nothing Where did this
picture come from
Martin turns back to his work
MARTIN
I found it here Its kind of
creepy dont you think

Ellen makes a face

ELLEN
Yeah It is kind of

She puts the picture back and leaves

21 LIVING ROOM - INT NIGHT
Ellen comes out of the kitchen and walks into the dark living
room She is carrying some sandwiches on a tray

The room is only lit by the flickering of the television set
A spooky atmosphere

In front of the TV is a large old armchair (the same one from
the opening sequence) Ellen frowns She slowly walks closer
to it

ELLEN
Martin

Suddenly Martins voice comes from behind the armchair

MARTIN
Damn

Martin pounds his flat hand against the television The screen
shows no image only snow

Ellen sets down the tray

ELLEN
What kind of a horrible thing is
that

MARTIN

It still worked in town

ELLEN
I mean the armchair

MARTIN
Oh that was upstairs A real
antiquity I think its great

Ellen instinctively feels appalled by the old piece of
furniture

ELLEN
I dont know

Martin is still fighting with the TV-set trying to finda
channel

ELLEN
Maybe the antennas broken

MARTIN
Were probably lucky that we even
have running water and electricity
Damned box

He hits the TV with his fist
Suddenly everything is dark

ELLEN
Hey the fuse

MARTIN
Oh damnit

He looks for a flashlight and switches it on

ELLEN
Do you know where fuse box is

MARTIN
In the cellar I think
Wait Ill take care of it

He leaves the room
22 CELLAR - INT NIGHT

Martin opens the fuse box and shines inside with his
flashlight A moldy mess of half-corroded wires leading into
various ancient switches The entire construction makes a
dangerous impression

MARTIN
(talking to himself
God look at that

The cellar seems even older than the house It is a large
cold sandstone catacomb Several pillars support the ceiling

The walls are clammy and cold

Martin is standing in the darkness Something approaches him
from behind - slowly threateningly

Martin is looking for the blown fuse

The thing comes closer Finally it grabs him

ELLEN
Boo
Martin spins around startled
MARTIN
Jesus Christ
Ellen laughs
ELLEN

I wanted to know whats taking you
so long Youve been down here
forever

(looks around shivering)
It sure is cold down here We
certainly wont be needing a
freezer

She catches sight of an old shelf loaded with all kinds of
strange old junk The shelf looks old and rickety Ellen
shakes at it testing its stability

ELLEN
Well sure be sorting a bunch of
this stuff out

Martin points to the fuse box

MARTIN
Look at this Well have to fix
the whole wiring This stuff is
dangerous as hell

ELLEN
Well call for someone from town
first thing in the morning

MARTIN
Are you crazy That costs a
fortune

ELLEN

Do you have a better idea

MARTIN
Ill do it myself

ELLEN
You

MARTIN
My father was an electrician
Already forgot that

ELLEN
My father was a pilot And do I
know how to fly

Theres a lot more Ellen would like to say about this but she
contends herself with a meaningful look

ELLEN
Just do me a favor and dont get
yourself roasted

Martin fumbles with one of the bigger switches finally flips
it to the other side Click The catacomb is lit A lonely
40-Watt lamp dangling from the ceiling casts a dim light
Martin gives Ellen a triumphant smile

CUT TO
23 OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE DOOR - EXT NIGHT

Ellen is leaning against the door frame dreamily gazing into
the night She is smoking a joint

Martin steps up from behind and takes the hand-rolled
cigarette out of her hand with a swift move He tosses it
away

MARTIN
Hey flower child the sixties are
over And this stuff is hazardous
to your health

ELLEN
Yes daddy

She gives him a hasty kiss and walks to the car

MARTIN
Where are you going

ELLEN
Well if you wont let me smoke
grass then at least Ill go get
myself some cigarettes

Ellen gets in the car and takes off

Martin contemplatively watches her go

MARTIN
That stuff is gonna end up killing
you
CUT TO
24 COUNTRY ROAD INSIDE CAR - EXT NIGHT

Ellen is behind the steering wheel She lights up a cigarette
as she drives down a lonely road There is a small bridge in
the distance

Ellen slows down She glances at a road sign

Suddenly her eyes widen She takes a second look

The road sign clearly reads

You have 6 days to live

The shock hits her like a fist

It takes her a moment to react Then she slams her foot on

the brake pedal

The car halts with screeching tires Ellen shifts into reverse
gear and drives back She stops by the sign

She reads Max 6 t Agricultural vehicles pass - a
perfectly normal sign

Ellen is confused How creepy She continues on her way
feeling a bit sick to the stomach

25 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT NIGHT

Ellen parks in front of the house and steps out of the car
She looks worn-out

Martin has piled up all of the old furniture from the house
Ellen walks over to him

ELLEN
What are you doing

MARTIN
Making our very own solstice fire

A match lights up The stacked furniture quickly catches fire
Only now does Martin notice the state his wife is in

MARTIN
Is everything alright Arent you
feeling well

ELLEN
I just had a really strange
experience

Martin gives her a questioning look

ELLEN
On an ordinary traffic sign I
read

Ellen interrupts her sentence Shes just too embarrassed to
say it

ELLEN
Oh nothing I guess I just still
havent recovered as well as I try
to make everyone believe

Martin puts his arm around her and holds her close

ELLEN
Maybe I should talk to Dr Roth
about it

MARTIN

Hey take your time You know time
heals better than any shrink ever
can
Arm in arm Ellen and Martin stand by the burning pile of
furniture staring into the fire

ELLEN
I have a funny feeling Do you
think well get over all thats

happened

MARTIN
We just have to make a new
beginning

ELLEN

Cherry-red Tears

MARTIN
What

ELLEN
Cherry-red Tears your first book
I read it at least nine times And
then I found out you were going to
attend some kind of book fair

MARTIN
Not a book fair I was signing
autographs in a department store

ELLEN
I was so excited about meeting you
Again and again I kept getting in
the back of the line so I could be
the last to talk to you

MARTIN
And two months later we got
married And all because of one
sentence
(quotes)
With you my life began
and with you shall it end

This sentence strikes a chord within Ellen It hardens her
heart

ELLEN
Dont say that Please

A short moment of silence Ellens eyes well up with tears

ELLEN
I miss Tommi so much

MARTIN
So do I believe me

ELLEN
Do you really think anything can
ever be like it was before

MARTIN
Maybe different I dont know
Ellen

ELLEN

If we stand a chance at all its
only by sticking together

Martin gives her a tender kiss The fire casts a warming shine
on the two of them and the old house - in the loneliness of the
moors

CUT TO
26 KITCHEN - INT DAY

Ellen is wearing a paint-stained flannel shirt She is busy
painting the kitchen walls
The RADIO is playing in the background

RADIOBROADCASTER
- a very special day today
Exceptionally hot even for this
time of year And all the windows
in my studio are already wide
open

Ellen isnt paying much attention to the radio Suddenly the
tone of the radiobroadcasters voice gets a more penetrating
touch

RADIOBROADCASTER
By the way Ellen
You have five days left to live
Ellen freezes She turns pale

Then suddenly a noise - someone is knocking on the window

Ellen spins around and startled tips over a bowl It smashes
on the floor

Standing by the open window is Karl Lindner a total stranger
to Ellen

Obviously he is much older now His face is caved in his
hair gray However his pleasant demeanor has stayed the same

He realizes that hes startled her
LINDNER
Oh sorry I didnt mean to scare

you

For a moment Ellen is at a loss for words She looks back to
the radio where the normal program is being continued
RADIOBROADCASTER
and matching todays weather
its time for some more of the
hottest music of the North
Ellen turns the radio off

ELLEN
Hello Can I help you

LINDNER
Does this dog here belong to you

Sitting next to him is a large mixed-breed with friendly eyes

ELLEN
No Ive never seen him before

LINDNER
You know I saw him sitting outside
your gate Oh Im sorry Im

forgetting my manners again I
havent even introduced myself yet
Hi my names Lindner

Karl Lindner

He offers her his hand through the window

ELLEN
Ellen Straub

LINDNER
Its a pleasure Youre from the
city right

ELLEN
Do I look like it that much

LINDNER
Village gossip Youre a real
attraction here

Ellen is still shook up by the radio announcement but
nevertheless tries to hold up a conversation

ELLEN
Youre from around here arent
you Theres something Ive been
wondering about the whole time
This house why has it been empty
all these years I mean I doubt
if it was the price

Lindner suddenly turns evasive and cool
LINDNER
I guess its too lonely for most
folks
(glances at his watch)
Its time for me to get going Its
been a pleasure meeting you

ELLEN
Wait wont you join me for a cup
of coffee
He turns down the offer a touch too vehemently
LINDNER
No thank you I need to get back
home My wife is waiting
He leaves Ellen contemplatively watches him go

Martin enters the kitchen and puts his arms around her

MARTIN
Who was that

ELLEN
Someone from the village

She turns around to face him

ELLEN
Martin theres something I
uh need to tell you about
CUT TO
27 LIVING ROOM - INT DAY

Martin is seated in the old armchair Ellen across from him
He is grinning

MARTIN
Okay now let me see if Ive got
this straight First you get
warnings from a road sign and then
from the weather forecast Which
one of us two was the author again

Ellen feels disappointed and misunderstood

ELLEN
Martin its not funny

MARTIN
You know its not always easy for
me either But at least I try not
to give in to each and every
neurosis
Now hes got her angry

ELLEN
Well apparently it was a big
mistake to try talking to you
Dont you remember what we promised
to each other Honesty - trust

MARTIN
Come on this isnt about honesty
You just need a good nights sleep
The way you toss and turn all
night even I hardly get any sleep

Ellen realizes there is no use in discussing this any further

ELLEN
Well excuse me for having bothered
you with my problems

She leaves the living room and walks out on Martin
28 HALLWAY - INT DAY

Ellen is using a spatula to scratch the old-fashioned yellowed
wallpaper off of the walls She is still upset and really
taking it out on the wallpaper

Martin comes walking up the steps He is carrying a plate full
of small deformed cakes

MARTIN
For you

He holds out the plate to her Ellen throws a skeptical look
at the mishap pastry She wont be bribed this easily

ELLEN
Now what did I do to deserve this

MARTIN
Come on at least try one It took
me two hours to make these

Ellen goes back to scratching off the wallpaper Martin
changes his tactic

MARTIN
What I really meant to say was Im
sorry Im a real bonehead
sometimes But its just that Im
worried about you Im afraid you
might get carried away with
something like that

Ellen interrupts her work and takes one of the cakes She
tastes it

ELLEN
Tastes awful
She grins Martin returns a smile
MARTIN

But baked with lots of love
Martin helps himself to a small cake too He bites off a
piece and makes a sour face Then he takes Ellens piece out
of her hand

MARTIN

I think Id better get rid of this

After all I dont want to kill

you

He turns to leave

ELLEN
Martin

Martin stops at the bottom of the staircase
ELLEN

-Maybe youre right and I just

need to get some sleep Dont

worry Ill get settled in sooner

or later

29 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT NIGHT
The farmhouse lies in the loneliness of a starless night
Silhouettes of gnarled trees reach for the sky like black
claws
30 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT
Its dark An eerie silence fills the house

Suddenly there is a CHILDS VOICE calling in the distance

CHILDS VOICE
Mommy

31 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT
Martin and Ellen are asleep in their bed

CHILDS VOICE
Mommy

Ellen wakes up out of her light slumber She opens her eyes
and looks around searching

ELLEN
Tommi

The voice clearly echoes through the house (It sounds like
Thomas call before the accident)

CHILDS VOICE
Mommy

Ellen silently sits up She is wide awake She tries to wake
up Martin

ELLEN
(whispering)
Martin did you hear that

No chance - Martin only mumbles a few unintelligible words and
continues to sleep

Ellen gets out of bed

CUT TO

32 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Almost mechanically the childs calling repeats itself

CHILDS VOICE
Mommy

Ellen carefully heads down the stairs toward the entrance
door The voice seems to be coming from outside

Ellen opens the door frightened

33 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT NIGHT

The pale moonlight dips the landscape into a ghostly
atmosphere

Ellens eyes search through the darkness

There There is something in the distance A child The
child is standing in the tall grass looking toward Ellen

ELLEN
Tommi

She cannot believe her eyes

It really is her little Thomas He smiles There is something
bout the way he moves that makes it look as if hes floating

o

ELLEN
(louder)
Tommi
The little boy laughs He turns around and runs away in the
grass as if in play

Ellen snaps out of her stiffness and chases after him

The small figure slowly disappears in the increasingly tall
grass

34 FOREST IN THE MOORS - EXT NIGHT

Ellen is running farther and farther away from the house She
stops

ELLEN
Tommi wait

But the little boy keeps running further

Ellen follows him but her path grows increasingly toilsome
Her feet sink deeper and deeper into the moor

Now the child is out of sight

Ellen is devastated She trips and falls to the ground The
swamp encloses her Ellen fights against the marsh that she is
sinking into deeper and deeper

Suddenly the little boy steps back out of the darkness He
stays a few feet away from Ellen He smiles as he watches

Ellen sink into the deadly swamp

With a sudden jerk an unknown force pulls her down into the
moor She is swallowed by the earth

35 BEDROOM - INT DAY

Ellen abruptly wakes up from her NIGHTMARE

She looks around herself She is in her comfortable bedroom
flooded with the warm rays of the morning sun Martins side
of the bed is already empty

Then she hesitates Something feels wrong Ellen throws back
her sheets Horror - her bed is full of mud

Ellen wants to scream She barely manages to suppress it

36 STUDY HALLWAY - INT DAY

Martin is sitting at his computer busily typing He seems to
be making progress on his book

In the background Ellen hurries past the study She is
carrying the dirty sheets under her arm Without looking up
from the monitor Martin calls through the open door
MARTIN
So did you sleep good

37 KITCHEN - INT DAY
ELLEN
(calling to Martin)
Yeah I have to go to town

Ellen enters the kitchen She hastily stuffs the bed-sheets
into the washing machine

ELLEN
Is there anything you need

She turns the washing machine on and heads for the door
38 ENTRANCE AREA - INT DAY

Ellen is about to leave the house The door is already open
In the entrance area she finds the dog (that Lindner had
previously discovered in their garden) sitting in front of the
cellar door

Ellen pets him in passing

ELLEN
(to the dog)
Hey youre still here I suppose
you like it here with us

MARTIN (0S)
(calling from the study)
No thanks I have everything I
need Drive safely you hear

Ellen is already out the door She pulls it shut behind her
CUT TO
39 CONSULTING ROOM OF PROF ROTH - INT DAY
A pleasantly decorated consulting room Standing by a window
is PROF ULRICH ROTH (Professor of Psychiatry) a distinguished
man around 50 years of age
PROF ROTH

You see there are various

approaches to an explanation for

what you are currently going

through

Ellen is hunched in a chair opposite of him

Prof Roth turns around to face her and takes a seat behind his
desk The leather chair creaks
PROF ROTH
One of the latest theories claim
that at certain frequencies air
conditioners create an oscillation
that can in fact cause
hallucinations They may also be
due to the interior pressure of
your eyes and so on and so forth
Personally I believe that all of
this is nonsense The loss of a
child is a traumatic experience
Subconsciously you may still be
blaming yourself for it and maybe
now believe that your son should
punish you

Ellen impatiently cuts him short

ELLEN
Listen its one thing to have a
guilt complex But I know the
difference between when Im
overstrung and when Im seeing
things that are simply not there
Besides it only began after we
moved

PROF ROTH
(hesitantly)
There is of course another
possible explanation which I dearly
hope is not the case

Lost in thought Prof Roth taps his pen on his desktop

ELLEN
And that is

PROF ROTH
A tumor - which could cause
pressure on certain parts of the
brain and thus influence your
perception

Ellen stares at him shocked
PROF ROTH
Just to be on the safe side I
would like to have a few tests
done

40 COMPUTER TOMOGRAPH - INT DAY

Ellen is lying on a stretcher slowly being moved into the
opening of the computer tomograph She is wearing a pale-green
hospital garment
The penetrating sound of the machines - technical coldness

41 DOCTORS OFFICE - INT DAY
Blood is filled into a cannula

Ellen is sitting on a stretcher The NURSE pulls the needle
out of her arm

DR SCHLETH a man who makes a somewhat lethargic impression
enters the room and fastens the tomograph shots in front of an
illuminated surface on the wall

DR SCHLETH
Congratulations You are
definitely the healthiest person
Ive had in CT for years

Ellen heaves a sigh of relief

DR SCHLETH
Dr Roth gave me these for you
Three times a day after meals

He hands her a box of tablets

ELLEN
What is this

DR SCHLETH
Fluctin A pretty strong
antidepressive If you asked me
Id try to do without them first

He takes a look into her health records

DR SCHLETH
You come from Goldmoor

Ellen answers absent-mindedly

ELLEN
We just moved there

DR SCHLETH
(by-the-way)
One time when I was in college we
examined a swamp corpse in
pathology They had excavated it
there

Now he has Ellens attention
DR SCHLETH

Three or four thousand years old
But I didnt deal with the subject
any more than necessary You know
I never liked pathology Somehow
I always felt it reduced humans to
something they are not

Suddenly Dr Schleths beeper goes off He takes a quick
glance at it and turns to leave

ELLEN
Dr Schleth

The doctor stops at the door

ELLEN
What do you believe happens to a
human after he dies

The otherwise reserved Dr Schleth suddenly seems very human

DR SCHLETH
You mean do I believe in something
like a soul

He smiles mischievously

DR SCHLETH
I havent seen one on any of my x-
ray pictures yet But then again
what would x-rays know

He turns around and walks out Lost in thought Ellen watches
him leave

42 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT NIGHT

Ellen steers the car into the driveway and climbs out The dog
runs to greet her wagging its tail Ellen kneels down in
front of the dog and pets it

ELLEN
Hey girl Here I brought you
something

She takes a collar with a little bell on it out of her purse
and puts it around the dogs neck

ELLEN
Now all we need is a name for you
How about Clara - okay then
Clara

She walks to the house door The dog follows her inside as if
it were the most natural thing to do The bell jingles

43 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Ellen enters the hallway At the same time Martin comes
upstairs from the cellar

ELLEN
Hi love Trouble with the fuses
again

Martin locks the door behind him

MARTIN
Its a real mess I think itd be
better for you not to go down there
for a while Its just too
dangerous

He drops the key for the cellar into his pocket Ellen watches
this with irritation Martins entire behavior seems odd

Behind Ellen the dog trots into the corridor

MARTIN
Dont tell me youve made friends
with that wandering flea circus

ELLEN
Why not She can guard the house
By the way I gave her a name
Clara

She pets the dog not noticing the frown on Martins face

MARTIN
Where have you been all day

ELLEN
I went to see Prof Roth You
know I had another one of those
dreams last night I saw Tommi

Suddenly the look on Martins face softens again He takes
Ellen into his arms to comfort her

MARTIN
Ellen our Tommi is dead And
theres nothing we can do about it

Ellen rests her head against his shoulder

ELLEN
You know Martin since we moved to
this house sometimes I just get

the feeling that the past is
catching up to us again

Martin interrupts her with unexpected ill temper and frees
himself from the hug

MARTIN
Oh Now were getting to the
point So all of a sudden its
the house Yesterday it was a
road sign And the first thing you
do is go and run to Dr Freud

He heads for the study leaving Ellen behind Ellen calls
after him

ELLEN
But thats not the point
What if all these things are
somehow connected

MARTIN
Oh baloney You should just hear
yourself talk

He treads up the staircase

MARTIN
Ill be in the study just in case
you decide to get reasonable after
all

Ellen watches him with consternation She goes into the
kitchen worried

44 KITCHEN - INT NIGHT

Lost in thought Ellen takes out a cup and pours herself a cup
of coffee from a thermos

She takes the pills that she got from Dr Schleth out of her
purse and studies them

She looks out through the window at the dreamlike landscape of
the moors There is a warm evening breeze

Suddenly Ellens eyes focus on the reflection of her face in
the window She faintly discerns something strange on her
forehead 4

Startled she touches her forehead There is nothing on it

When she takes a second look at her reflection everything is
normal again

The dog trots up to Ellen whining balefully

ELLEN
(to the dog)
Either Martin is right or I am
really starting to lose my mind

For a moment she considers taking one of the tablets But
then she determinedly throws the whole package in the trash
can
CUT TO
45 IN THE VILLAGE - EXT DAY

Ellen parks her car in the center of the nearby village The
small township is smothering in a humid summers heat

Ellen heads for a bookstore with Clara trotting in behind
46 AT THE BOOKSTORE - INT DAY

Ellen enters the shop It is unusually dark and quiet in here
She runs her fingers across the shelves searching

She passes by a stand with pocket books also including several
copies of Cherry-red Tears next to Stephen Kings
Shining She stops for a moment Smiles

Then she finds the department for books on psychology She
pulls out a book titled The Inner Child - The Ghosts of the
Past Leafs through it She stops at a certain page

ELLEN
(quietly reads to herself
certain places arouse
recollections and links within
us

Suddenly Ellen hears a voice behind her

SALES LADY (0S)
First buy it then read it

Ellen looks up The sales lady is standing in front of her a
skinny woman with small eyes suspiciously beaming at Ellen

ELLEN
Yes of course Ill take it

She places the book on the counter All of a sudden the sales
lady has turned into the worlds most friendly person Ellen
follows her to the cash register and gives her the book

The sales lady skeptically eyes the psychology book while she
notes the price

Ellen puts the money on the counter and turns to leave the
store when the sales lady speaks up again

SALES LADY
Youre the wife of that author
arent you

Ellen turns back to face her

ELLEN
Martin Straub yes

SALES LADY
Used to write some nice books your
husband But that last one was
awful A terrible book Didnt
sell either

Ellen really cant think of an answer to that

SALES LADY
I read it - violent trash My
husband said so too

ELLEN
Well Ive got to get going
bye

Ellen walks out of the shop The sales lady keeps talking
Her eyes are cold

SALES LADY
(loud)
Its bad and its violent I dont
like that kind of stuff Tell that
to your husband

47 OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE - EXT DAY

Clara is still waiting in front of the bookstore when Ellen
comes back outside

ELLEN
Come on Clara Lets get out of
here

Just as she sets out for her car she discovers Karl Lindner
and his wife He seems to want to pass by her without saying
hello

ELLEN
Mr Lindner

Lindner realizes he has no way out of this situation
LINDNER
Oh Mrs Straub May I introduce

you to my wife

MRS LINDNER
Just call me Elisabeth

She seems like a truly honest person and very awake despite
her advanced age Ellen shakes hands with her

ELLEN
Ellen
MRS LINDNER
Youre doing fine arent you I
mean the two of you alone in
that house so far out in the moor

Lindner nudges his wife with his elbow

ELLEN
In the moor What do you mean by
that

Mrs Lindner wants to answer something but her husband heads
her off

LINDNER
Stop scaring people Lets go
We need to be on our way

MRS LINDNER
Excuse us But do stop by for a
visit sometime You are welcome
anytime

Lindner manages a smile and leads his wife away by the arm

LINDNER
Have a nice day

As soon as they are out of hearing distance Mrs Lindner tells
her husband with obvious anger

MRS LINDNER
(quiet reproachfully)
You didnt tell her

LINDNER
We should leave the past alone

MRS LINDNER
Well it will never leave us alone
as long as you ignore it

Back to Ellen She watches the two of them go for a moment
Then she gets into her car and drives off

CUT TO
48 STUDY - INT DUSK

Martin is in the study working at his computer He is ina
writing frenzy typing in the words like a madman Ellen comes
through the door She is carrying the book about Goldmoor in
her hand At first Martin does not react to her He keeps on

typing

ELLEN
It seems to be going well for you
Martin continues to type as he speaks

MARTIN
Where have you been

ELLEN
In the village Look what I found

She opens the book to a certain page and holds it under his
nose

Martin is annoyed for having to interrupt his work

MARTIN
Psychology huh So what side of
the rainbow are we on today

Ellen points out a certain passage in the book

ELLEN
(reads out loud)
Events commonly interpreted as
haunting apparitions often result
from psychic disharmonies or
undigested traumatic ordeals

MARTIN
(impatient)
Ellen what are you trying to
prove anyway That weve created
ourselves a ghost Come on

Ellen persistently tries to get through to him

ELLEN
Its just a feeling Dont you
sense it too

MARTIN
What What am I supposed to sense

ELLEN
The house - Tommi - something just
doesnt jive here

Suddenly Martins voice gets disproportionately loud

MARTIN
Now you go starting that again
We decided together to build up
something new here I for my
part am working on it very hard
But oddly you seem to have changed
your mind
Ellen wants to reply something but just then the doorbell
RINGS

MARTIN
Whos that

ELLEN
I havent the slightest idea

When she sees that Martin does not intend to answer the door
Ellen goes downstairs herself

49 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Ellen opens the door Standing in the doorway are Paul and
Claudia both in the best of moods

PAUL AND CLAUDIA
Surprise

Ellen hugs them her mind still halfway on Martin
ELLEN
Well this really is a surprise

Come on in

Martin comes downstairs He seems anything but pleased by the
company

Paul gives him a jovial pat on the shoulder
PAUL
Hey my man Hows the masterpiece
coming along
MARTIN
Not so bad if I could get some
peace and quiet around here
Paul understands the side-swipe
PAUL
Hey hey hey Say no more until

youve seen what we brought

He puts a wide grin on his face Ellen and Martin exchange
quick looks Paul pulls something out from behind his back

PAUL
Scrabble

CUT TO
50 LIVING ROOM - INT NIGHT

Martin looks annoyed The four friends are comfortably seated
around the living room table Each of them has a glass of
wine
While they play Scrabble Paul tells a dirty story

PAUL
God you shouldve seen him Elke
Schneider enters the room and
storms up to him She is
tremendous Her breasts are so big
that just recently there was a
discussion about whether they
should be given country names of
their own

Laughter all around the table Martin is the only one who is
not delighted But Ellen is clearly relieved by this moment of
normality in the house

ELLEN
Paul you and your stories Ive
really missed you

Claudia looks around the living room Apparently she likes
what shes seeing

CLAUDIA
Im impressed You two have really
gotten quite a bit done already

The sack with the Scrabble-letters is passed on to Ellen She
reaches inside

ELLEN
What do you think We worked our
fingers to the bone and now were
both about to have a nervous
breakdown

Ellen places the letters on the table in front of her and
begins to shuffle them back and forth

CLAUDIA
I really wouldnt have thought you
two could stand it out here for
this long To tell the truth we
even have some bets going with a
couple of people

But Ellen isnt paying attention to Claudias words any more
Terrified she stares at her Scrabble-stones which she has
already put together The letters form the words
T-H-R-E-E--D-A-Y-S

Everyone is waiting for her to make her turn Paul starts
nagging

PAUL
Well Are you going to play
Ellen feverishly gathers up her letter stones and throws them
back into the sack She shakes it with special thoroughness

and draws anew

ELLEN
I pass

Paul is pleased He puts down his word
PAUL
Triple word score that makes 72
points Now what do you say to

that honey-bunny

CLAUDIA
My hero

They kiss

Ellen lines up her newly drawn stones in front of herself
again Martin watches her

Ellen cannot believe her eyes Again her letter combination
spells out

T-H-R-E-E--D-A-Y-S
This time the others notice the look on Ellens face too

CLAUDIA
Ellen whats wrong

It takes Ellen a moment to answer
ELLEN
I just got exactly the same letters

for the second time

She gives Martin a significant look and shows him her letter-
board This time she has proof

MARTIN
(sarcastically)
Oh three days A new message
He turns to Paul and Claudia
MARTIN

Because - you know - Ellen is
receiving messages from road signs
radio broadcasters and now from
Scrabble game stones

He turns Ellens letter-board around for the others to see
Martins reaction hits Ellen like a fist She feels
humiliated She is at a loss for words

MARTIN
And the best part is She thinks
the messages are meant to announce
her death
(makes a spooky noise)
Hooooo

Claudia looks back and forth between Martin and Ellen She

realizes how serious the situation is As opposed to Paul
pulls out a news ARTICLE

PAUL
Talk about spooky Martin do you
remember that splintered door to
the study I guess there was more
to it than just a lost key

who

The headline of the article reads Murder in Goldmoor - Many

questions remain unanswered

ELLEN
Let me see that

Ellen takes the article The picture underneath shows Karl

Lindner in police uniform 23 years younger

Before she even has a chance to read the article Martin grabs

the newspaper out of her hands
He crumples up the paper and angrily turns to Paul

MARTIN
Just perfect Paul Well done
Cant you tell that my wife is
upset enough already And then you
come up with this kind of a story

Ellen has regained her composure She is still outraged

ELLEN
What do you think youre doing
anyway Now give me back that
article

Martin shows no sign of reaction
MARTIN
Ellen I just dont want you to get

upset for no reason

He tries to conciliate by putting his arm on her shoulder
Ellen shakes him off

ELLEN
(sarcastic)

But
How thoughtful of you

An unpleasant moment of silence Ellen looks at Claudia and

Paul - she doesnt want to make a fool of herself

ELLEN
Excuse me for a moment

She storms out of the room
Paul and Claudia both look a bit sheepish

Martin holds the article to a candle and burns it in an
ashtray

MARTIN
She shouldnt be worrying about
this stuff Lately shes been
acting strange enough already

51 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT NIGHT
Ellen is standing in front of the house Lost in thought

takes a drag from her cigarette
Claudia comes out of the house and joins her

CLAUDIA
Whats this going on between you
two

ELLEN

Oh I dont know I was hoping
things would get better once we
moved

CLAUDIA
But nothing got any better

she

Ellens eyes wander over the vast landscape of moors which the

darkness of the night has transformed into a surreal shadow

painting

ELLEN
Lately Martin hasnt been his
normal self The work the
relocation

CLAUDIA
You have to give him some time
Ellen Hes under enormous
pressure right now He hasnt
written a single decent sentence
since the accident

Ellen takes a last long drag from her cigarette throws it on

the ground and puts it out with her foot
ELLEN
Yes I know I try my best Its
just that sometimes I wonder if
we made a mistake by moving here

52 LIVING ROOM - INT NIGHT

Martin and Paul are still seated opposite each other A
strange atmosphere Paul is trying hard to keep up a
conversation

PAUL
So work is going well you say

Martin makes a very calm impression In the background the
dog is barking at the cellar door

MARTIN
(calmly)
Yes Splendid I finally found a
story thats both thrilling and
true to life

Now Clara starts to bark at the cellar door

PAUL
Im glad to hear that You know

Martin has a sudden outburst and yells

MARTIN
(to the dog)
NOW SHUT UP YOU STUPID BITCH

Paul is all confused now He throws a helpless look toward the
entrance door

PAUL
You know I think I have to get up

early in the morning We ought to
get going

53 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Clara is still barking at the cellar door Then she starts to
claw at the crack below the door as if she had discovered
something behind it

CUT TO

54 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT DAY

The next morning

The house is enclosed in a light curtain of early morning fog

Everything seems oddly quiet Not a single bird is chirping

The calm before the storm
55 BEDROOM - INT DAY

Ellen wakes up out of her light sleep She looks around
Martins side of the bed is empty and unused Martin did not
spend the night by her side

CUT TO
56 KITCHEN - INT DAY

Ellen enters the kitchen in her bathrobe She puts on a pot of
coffee Martin comes in

MARTIN
Hi darling

Ellen turns around to face him She is terror-stricken

His hands are covered with blood He seems to be oblivious to
it In the best of moods he walks to the kitchen sink while
he continues to speak

MARTIN
At last Im back on top Seventy
pages in one night Id say that
just about breaks the record

He starts washing his hands with meticulous care The red-
stained water runs into the drain

Ellen closes her eyes and fights the panic welling up inside of
her

MARTIN
Ellen Is everything alright

She opens her eyes again She takes a second look and sees
that what she thought to be blood is only wall paint She

discovers a bucket with a paintbrush beside the kitchen door

She tries to conceal her thoughts

ELLEN
Oh sure Im just a little
dizzy
She hastily grabs the dogs food dish and fills it - Simply to
be doing something anything
ELLEN
I ought to give Clara something to

eat
Ellen goes outside

57 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT DAY
Ellen carries the dish outside and starts searching for Clara

ELLEN
Clara

Nothing stirs

ELLEN
Come here Clara Ive got
something yummy for you

Then she catches sight of something dark lying a bit away in
the grass

Ellen puts down the dog food and runs toward the spot

There lying in the tall grass she finds the dog Its dead
It looks as if a wild animal had attacked Clara

ELLEN
Oh no
(loud)
Martin

She kneels down beside the animals dead body
ELLEN
(screams)

Martin

Martin comes out of the house and stops at the door He is
calm - too calm

MARTIN
What

ELLEN
Look at this The dog Shes
dead

Martin shows no reaction He doesnt even seem to find it
worth the trouble to go over to Ellen who is still kneeling in
the grass

MARTIN
She was old

ELLEN
Old Come look at this She has
wounds Wounds on her head Like
thrashes Or bites

MARTIN
Maybe an animal

ELLEN
(furious)

An animal What kind of animal

A goddamned T-Rex or what
Martin is still apathetically standing in the doorway

MARTIN

She spent a couple of pleasant days

with us and now shes dead

Thats the way it is Im sorry

I have work to do
He goes back inside
Ellen watches him
This very instant she realizes that this is not the man she
once married She knows that the time has come to take up
action
CUT TO
58 MOOR - EXT DAY
A short distance away from the house Ellen has buried the dog
She sticks a small self-built wooden crucifix into the soft

earth

She stands there for a moment She looks over at the house

jingles

Ellen rings the doorbell

She is standing in front of Lindners house While she waits
she looks up and down the street There is no one in sight

The entire village seems deserted

Elisabeth Lindner opens the door She doesnt seem very
surprised to see Ellen

MRS LINDNER
Oh Ellen Ive been wondering

retired

CUT TO
62 LINDNERS STUDY - INT DAY

Ellen enters the spacious study Lindner is seated in front of
an easel dexterously painting lines onto a canvas He is
working on a still life of flowers

Without turning around to Ellen he says

LINDNER
Come in

Ellen takes a look around the room It is also furnished in
dark colors and there are dozens of oil paintings standing
around the room Every single one a still life of flowers

ELLEN
You only draw flowers A little
unusual for a former policeman

Lindner obstinately continues to work on his painting

LINDNER
You know after doing that job for
so many years you learn to
appreciate the simple things in
life Flowers incorporate a beauty
that I always missed in life But
certainly youre not here to chat
about my hobbies

ELLEN
1976 What happened back then

With a heavy heart he puts down his paintbrush and turns
face Ellen

LINDNER
Do yourself a favor Dont ask

ELLEN
I appreciate your concern but we
live in that house I need to know
what happened in there

Lindner turns back to his painting and continues to draw
seems introverted as if he were talking to himself

LINDNER
We found the wife about a week
after she had died hunched in her
TV-chair Her husband was sitting
in front of her the whole time he
sat in front of her dead body A
whole damn week Her death
certificate says that she drowned
and her husband was convicted but
God alone knows what really
happened back then

Ellen is shocked Still she persists

ELLEN
What made him do it

Lindner doesnt answer

ELLEN
That man is he still alive Where
is he Can I talk to him

Lindner turns around to her again This time he looks
determined

LINDNER
Why dont you just leave the past
alone and now go - please

Ellen sees that its no use She turns to leave But she

stops at the door and turns back once more

ELLEN
If theres one thing Ive learned
lately its that you can not run

to

He
away from the past Believe me

She leaves the old policeman behind Once alone he lowers his
eyes

CUT TO
63 IN FRONT OF LINDNERS HOUSE - EXT DAY

Ellen leaves the house reflective Just as she heads through
the gate Mrs Lindner catches up with her

MRS LINDNER
Ellen Wait

She hands Ellen a small note

MRS LINDNER
Frank Kosinski Heres the
address Go see him Ask him

ELLEN
Thank you Elisabeth I didnt
mean to

Mrs Lindner puts it off with a smile

MRS LINDNER
Thats alright Dont
misunderstand my husband Its
only that hes already had enough
problems with this case
And who would believe him if he
told the truth

ELLEN
But what is the truth

MRS LINDNER
I dont know all about what
happened back then But it always
stood between me and my husband
Ellen nods and leaves

64 PSYCHIATRY - EXT DAY

Ellen parks her car in front of the large old building She
opens the heavy double doors of the entrance

65 PSYCHIATRY - INT DAY
A long wood-paneled hallway with small resting areas Some of

the elderly people are sitting around others are playing cards
or staring at a television - a strange atmosphere
Ellen approaches a SOCIAL WORKER who is pushing an OLD LADY
through the hallway in a wheelchair
The old lady giggles as if she were mentally disoriented

ELLEN
Excuse me Im looking for Frank
Kosinski

The young man is of the silly bored type

SOCIAL WORKER
Kosinski
(thinks for a moment)
Oh - you mean KK

ELLEN
Sorry

The social worker grins He seems to think hes very funny

SOCIAL WORKER
Killer-Kosinski thats what they
call him around here He did away
with his wife

Now the old lady joins in on the conversation

OLD LADY
Im so glad you finally came
Weve all been waiting for you

She gently touches Ellens hand - The old lady seems to be
taking Ellen for someone else

ELLEN
(softly to the old lady)
You must be mistaking me
(to the young man)
Where can I find the man

SOCIAL WORKER
Hes in the closed psychiatry This
heres the open section Go down
the hall third door to the left

ELLEN
Thank you

The old lady keeps on persisting

OLD LADY
Are you doing better yet

Ellen is too preoccupied to worry about the old lady She
leaves them with a quick nod and hurries on
The social worker starts pushing the wheelchair forward again
Walking away Ellen still hears the old ladys voice

OLD LADY
(to social worker)
Poor girl She only has two more
days to live you know

Ellen stops She turns on her heels and runs back

She excitedly stops the wheelchair and leans over to the old
lady

ELLEN
What was that What did you say

The old lady doesnt seem to recognize her any more

OLD LADY
What do you want from me

ELLEN
What you just said about the two
days

OLD LADY

I didnt say anything
Ellen looks at the social worker hoping that he might help

SOCIAL WORKER
I didnt hear anything Sorry

Ellen doubtfully looks back and forth between the two of them
ELLEN
Im sorry I guess I was

mistaken

She quickly turns her back to this embarrassing situation and
leaves

66 HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF KOSINSKIS CELL - INT DAY

The MALE NURSE turns the key Before opening the heavy door
he gives Ellen a questioning look

NURSE
He has his clear moments every now

hopes up high
They both enter the cell

Frank Kosinski (approx 70 years old now) is sitting at a desk
He is busy putting newspaper articles into clear plastic
folders and carefully sorting them away

Ellen enters the room The nurse closes the door from inside
and stays standing next to it

The room looks more like an office archive than the cell of a
closed psychiatric clinic There are several shelves filled
with neatly lined up files

ELLEN
Mr Kosinski

The old man takes no notice of her Ellen steps up to him
obviously feeling very uncomfortable about it

ELLEN
Mr Kosinski my name is Ellen
Straub I live in your house out
in Goldmoor I mean the house
where you used to live There are
a few questions I would like to ask
you

Kosinski does not react He seems so lost in his own world
that he hasnt even registered her presence He stubbornly
continues sorting his papers

ELLEN
Mr Kosinski Can you hear me

She waves her hand in front of his face No reaction
Ellen realizes that shell have to come up with something else

She walks to one of the shelves and pulls out a file titled
1976 Leafs through it She finds the article that Paul
had brought the other night

She lays it on the desk right in front of Kosinskis nose

ELLEN
1976 - What happened back then
You

Now she has his attention As if she had pushed the button of
a tape recorder Kosinski immediately begins to recite the
article He seems to know it by heart

KOSINSKI
October 4 1976 To this day the
cold-blooded murder at the remote
homestead continues to bring up
questions Investigations have
shown no satisfactory results As
was announced by a police spokesman

Ellen gives the nurse a questioning look
NURSE
Never mind its his usual number

ELLEN
Yes Thats right What happened
back then

Although Kosinski has the news article right in front of him
he seems to be staring at the air Ellen tests him by taking
away the news report Kosinski continues to recite

KOSINSKI
another unsolved mystery is
the question why doors and windows
had been nailed shut The murder
suspect and only witness is still
in a state of mental derangement

Again Ellen tries to interrupt him

ELLEN
Okay fine I read that Its
written in the article What I
want to know is What really
happened back then

Kosinski mechanically continues to speak Absolutely
inanimate

KOSINSKI
Friends and family describe
him as a friendly reliable
husband He had been forced into
closing his small trades business
after bankruptcy It is uncertain
whether this might have been cause
for marital dispute

Ellen realizes that she cannot get through to him with words
She finds a page on the desk that was torn out of a chronicle
about Goldmoor

ELLEN
August 17 1869

KOSINSKI
August 17 1869 A messenger
found Mr and Mrs Eugen and
Wilhelmine Meister dead in their
house

With both astonishment and dismay Ellen listens to the old
mans monotonous lecture

KOSINSKI
The police constable in charge
found no traces The motive of the
crime remains a mystery

Ellen turns to the nurse

ELLEN
Could I please speak with him alone
for a moment

NURSE
Are you sure

ELLEN
Ill be fine Thank you

The nurse leaves the cell with a frown

Ellen takes Kosinskis chair and turns him around She looks
straight into his blank eyes

ELLEN
I am starting to get the impression
that all of this is some kind of
bad joke Im seeing things that
are not there my own husband is
becoming a total stranger and your
old friend Lindner wont tell me
what he knows I have no idea what
youre trying to prove with this
performance of yours but I am not
leaving this room before I hear the
truth

No reaction Kosinski continues to stare at nothing in
particular

Ellen gives up Shaking her head she turns to the door

KOSINSKI
Its a grave

Ellen freezes and looks back at Kosinski She walks back over
to him

ELLEN
What

Suddenly Kosinski seems to have snapped out of his autism
He is holding an old book in his hands The book contains
clippings notes and among others a page that seems to have
been torn out of another book

It is an etching from the Middle Ages illustrating a man being
pushed into the swamp by several villagers

Ellen reads the text underneath the illustration

ELLEN
Execution in the moor

All of a sudden Kosinski grabs Ellen and pulls her close His
eyes have a feverish glow

KOSINSKI
The moor its one big grave
CUT TO
68 ENTRANCE AREA HALLWAY - INT NIGHT

Ellen enters the hallway She runs into Martin who is on his
way up from the cellar

When he sees Ellen he shuts the cellar door and puts the key
into his pocket again It seems as if he felt caught doing
something

ELLEN
(sarcastic)
Let me guess Another short
circuit
MARTIN

Hi darling

Martin ignores her comment and starts to head up the stairs to
his study

ELLEN
What is going on down there
anyway Why am I not supposed to
go in the cellar

Martin stops at the base of the stairway

MARTIN
I told you Its too dangerous
Besides I have to work now

He continues up the staircase Ellen follows him

ELLEN
Martin we need to talk Ive done
some research This lovely house
of ours has a history of murder
cases

Martin does not stop walking but his eyes show alarm

ELLEN
Anyone who ever lived in this house
either quickly moved back out or
fell victim to strange accidents
or ended up killing each other

69 STUDY - INT NIGHT
Martin sits down at his desk and immediately starts typing
Ellen wont give up so easy

ELLEN
I know you dont believe me but at
least hear me out Dont tell me
you havent noticed that weve been
going through some strange changes
since we moved here
We hardly talk to each other any
more youre writing like a madman
and Im having these visions

Martin does not interrupt his work
Ellen slams the articles from Kosinski on his keyboard

ELLEN
Here look at this Did you know
that our house is built right ona
spot where during the Middle Ages
people were executed They simply
threw the convicts into the moors
alive

Martin shakes his head He smiles and shoves the articles
aside

MARTIN
During the Middle Ages people were
executed at every corner Whats
your point

ELLEN
is house the whole damned area
round here is one mass grave
ow you might call me crazy but
ere is something negative about
e place

tet aon

MARTIN

Okay so the house has a history
and there might still be a couple
of corpses in the moors

(mocking)
There is something negative about
the place What the hell are
you trying to say Come on Spit
it out
Ellen twists around
ELLEN
Its like a sickness And its

gotten into our heads
Now Martin gets aggressive

MARTIN
Will you finally cut it out Just
in case you havent noticed I am
trying to write a book here And
maybe - even with your birdbrains -
you can figure its a pretty tough
job
So why cant you just leave me
alone

ELLEN
Damn it look at you Dont you
see whats happening with you We
need to get out of here dont you
understand Out of this house

Martin threatens her with his forefinger

MARTIN
Now let me work

Martin continues to write
ELLEN
(hollers)

To hell with your damned work

In a rash action she suddenly pushes his computer monitor off
of the desk

Martin jumps up from his chair He grabs Ellen by the throat
and pushes her against the wall Throbbing veins on his

forehead

MARTIN
Dont you dare

Ellen can hardly breathe She is about to choke Just in
time Martin lets go

Ellen slides to the floor and gasps for air

Martin doesnt seem to care He sets the monitor back onto the
table and gets back to work

Ellen is deeply shocked She drags herself out of the room
Martin doesnt even deign to look up at her again

70 HALLWAY - INT NIGHT

The door to the study falls shut behind Ellen

Slowly she sinks to her knees and starts to cry Hopelessness
and despair
ELLEN
(sobbing)
Martin oh my God whats
happening to us

The house is dead-silent Only the sound of Martin typing on
his computer keyboard in his study

Suddenly Ellen hears a noise - very quiet It is the RINGING
of a bell

Ellen looks up

There it is again very clearly Its the bell on the collar
of the dead dog

ELLEN
(quietly to herself)
Clara

She stands up and heads for the staircase Cautiously

A shadow rushes through the entrance hall - the shadow of a
dog

Ellen sneaks down the steps Her eyes scan the darkness
71 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Again the BELL RINGING The shadow The animal seems to have
run into the cellar

Now Ellen notices that the door Martin had locked so carefully
earlier is open

A dirty-yellow gleam shines into the hallway from below

Ellen looks up - Martin seems to be working His steady typing
resounds throughout the house

It takes Ellen all the courage she has but finally she makes
herself go into the cellar

72 STUDY - INT NIGHT

Martin stops typing in mid-sentence He looks up There is a
threatening gleam in his eyes

73 CELLAR - INT NIGHT
Ellen carefully walks down the stairs to the cellar Its
cold The single light bulb at the ceiling hardly sheds any

light An eerie and unsettling atmosphere

No sign of the dog
Ellen finds the fuse box No difference - the wires are still
hanging out of the wall tangled up and rotten

All of a sudden there is a voice coming from behind Ellen

THOMAS (0OS)
Mommy

Ellen spins around

Theres something in the darkness - a figure Tommi

Ellen freezes Her eyes are glued to the little boy whose
figure melts together with the shadows Like a tape recording
he repeats

THOMAS
Mommy

Ellen fights up against the image as if she knew that it is
only a lie

ELLEN
No

The boy steps out of the shadow

THOMAS
Mommy

Ellen backs off

ELLEN
My son is dead

The little boy comes closer Now he is standing right in
front of Ellen He raises his hands as if he wanted to be
hugged Again his sad voice repeats

THOMAS
Mommy

Finally Ellens heart wins over reason She falls to her
knees and takes the boy into her arms

ELLEN
My God Tommi

Tears run down her cheeks She holds the child close But
what she doesnt see The boys mean smile behind her back

Suddenly there is a strange transformation Running through
Ellens fingers - little at first but then more and more
mud

Thomas body has turned into liquid in her arms Ellen is
devastated
Right before her eyes the child dissolves into swamp mud
drains away and disappears in the floor

Time seems to stand still

Suddenly Ellen is grabbed by the hair and torn around
Its Martin He stares at her resentfully

MARTIN
Didnt I tell you not to go in the
cellar

Ellen does not understand whats happening

ELLEN
Martin what-

MARTIN
Its simply too dangerous here
But no you always have to have it
your way

She tries to squirm out of his grip - but its no use
Martin drags her up the stairs

MARTIN
You know what I have to do now
and believe me I dont enjoy
doing this

ELLEN
Martin damnit what are you up to
Let go of me

74 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT
Martin mercilessly drags Ellen along behind him

MARTIN
Of course youll give me the blame
again Like back then Just a
tiny cut and he could still be
alive today - isnt that right
Ellen

ELLEN
What are you talking about-

Ellen tries to find a way to free herself But she hardly
stands a chance against Martins strength

MARTIN
Enough of that I know what I have

to do now

Sliding by Ellen bumps into a tool box She gets hold of a
screwdriver
Panic-stricken she thrusts it in Martins direction

A scream of pain He collapses Bleeds

Ellen tears herself loose and runs out of the house

75 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE CAR - EXT NIGHT

Ellen races to the car and jumps in behind the steering wheel

Martin staggers out in pursuit of her He is holding his
stomach

Inside the car
Ellen hastily crams out the car key It slips out of her hand

Martin is coming closer

Inside the car
Ellen gropes around in the darkness trying to find the key

Martin has almost reached the car
Inside the car
At last Ellen has the key She pushes it into the ignition

turns it around The engine roars up

Ellen careens off in the car She brushes Martin He spins
away with a loud thud

The car speeds off

CUT TO

76 CONSULTING ROOM OF PROF ROTH - INT DAWN

Prof Roth is in the middle of a conference with two INTERNS
The door flies open Ellen storms into the room with tears in
her eyes she is totally frantic

Her appearance surprises him

PROF ROTH
Mrs Straub

ELLEN
Ive killed my husband

PROF ROTH
What

ELLEN
I think Ive killed him Martin
my husband Ive killed him That
is Im not sure but
Prof Roth immediately takes her arm and leads her to a sofa

PROF ROTH
Mrs Straub Now calm down first

Ellen is totally distraught

ELLEN
(hectic loud)
It all went so fast He was out of
his mind and then all of sudden
there was this screwdriver I only
wanted to defend myself You have
to call the police

PROF ROTH
We can do all of that later but
first you need to calm down

He stands up fetches a glass of water and takes a tablet out
of a package

PROF ROTH
Here take this

Ellen takes the pill without a moments hesitation and swallows
it with a drink of water

ELLEN
I I dont know which part of it
all really happened Its all one

big nightmare

Prof Roth sees that she is not able to think clearly at the
moment

PROF ROTH
You are going to sleep for a little
while now And then well talk
about it more calmly and sift
through all of this

The tablet quickly begins to show an effect In Ellens eyes
Prof Roths face gets blurry

One of the interns speaks up

INTERN
Should we inform the authorities

Prof Roth waves it off

PROF ROTH
Before everyone gets all nervous
why dont you call her house
Maybe that will clear things up
Ellen only vaguely catches the last spoken sentences through a
curtain of haze Then she loses conscience

FADE TO

77 HOSPITAL ROOM - INT DAY

Ellen drowsily wakes up in a hospital room She takes a
careful look around herself The room is surprisingly nice and
pleasantly furnished

78 HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - INT DAY

There is a lot going on in the hospital corridor
MALE and FEMALE NURSES busily take care of their duties

A hand picks up a syringe and an ampoule from a trolley
79 HOSPITAL ROOM - INT DAY
The door is opened

Ellen barely manages to lift her head in order to see who the
visitor is

A man pulls a wheelchair inside with his back turned to her
and closes the door

ELLEN
Professor Roth

The man turns around Its Martin
He is wearing his best suit He shows no signs of a wound

Ellen wants to call for help but Martin is already up next to
her and holds her mouth shut with his hand

MARTIN
Hello darling Are you feeling
better

He thrusts the syringe into her leg

Ellen desperately searches for the emergency button for the
nurses room

MARTIN
(whispers)
Shh everything will be fine
Tomorrow it will all be over
Just dont try to fight it

Ellen has found the button but the medication is faster She
doesnt have enough strength to push the button any more

Her tired eyes blink and fall shut for a moment
FADE TO
80 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

Ellens eyes slowly open again She wakes up to a loud
HAMMERING noise

Only now does she realize that she is lying on the planking of
her own bed with her hands and feet roped tight Martin has

put a gag in her mouth He is standing by the window nailing
several large boards in front of it

He is so preoccupied with his work that he hasnt yet noticed

that Ellen is awake He quietly curses under his voice

MARTIN
You stupid little bitch think
you can toy around with people any
old way you like But not me no

Ellen carefully tries to loosen the ropes The sound catches
Martins attention He turns around to her He is still
holding a nail in the corner of his mouth

MARTIN
(sweetly)
Oh sweetheart youre awake
already

He takes the nail out of the corner of his mouth and opens his
suit jacket Underneath we see his blood-soaked shirt But
he doesnt seem to feel any pain

MARTIN
That really wasnt very nice of you
yesterday I always thought you
loved me You know I bet any
other husband would be pretty upset
with you now

He sits down on the bed next to her and begins to loosen her
gag

MARTIN
But I believe in our relationship
What are such trifles compared to
that

He takes the gag out of her mouth Ellens voice is shaking
ELLEN
Martin for heavens sake tie me
loose

Martin seriously shakes his head

MARTIN
Believe me Id really like to
But I have the feeling youre not
ready yet

Ellen lies there totally helpless

ELLEN
Ready For what This is crazy
Dont you see whats going on here

He moves closer to her caresses her cheek

MARTIN
The last day Ellen Today is the
last day The circle is closing

Ellen suddenly understands

ELLEN
You knew

Martin slowly leans over and kisses her Ellen tries to turn
her head away but Martin holds it tight Barbaric - there is
nothing tender about this kiss

MARTIN
Oh Ellen My sweet Ellen
Of course I knew

ELLEN
We loved each other once Have you
forgotten that
Martin seems bitter
MARTIN
Oh yeah Did we really Think
about it Ellen
Just then the DOORBELL rings They both look toward the door
Quick as a flash Martin presses his hand on Ellens mouth so

she cannot scream

MARTIN
Are you expecting company

81 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT NIGHT

Karl Lindner is standing at the door He presses the doorbell
button He is carrying one of his flower paintings under his
arm

82 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

Martin puts the gag back into Ellens mouth

MARTIN
Make yourself comfortable Ill be
right back
He stands up and leaves the room

Ellen hears him lock the door from outside She immediately
begins to tear at her ropes

83 HALLWAY ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

The doorbell RINGS again While Martin runs downstairs he
buttons up his suit jacket again in order to conceal the blood
stains

He is still holding the hammer in his hand

He walks to the door and opens it to Lindner

LINDNER
Good evening Karl Lindner Ima
friend of your wife Is she in

84 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

Ellen is still tied to the bed She faintly hears the two
mens VOICES from downstairs

She moves her head trying to get rid of the gag - in vain
Ellen screams but only muffled sounds come out

She doubles her efforts and tears at her ropes with all her
might

85 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE ENTRANCE AREA - EXT NIGHT

Martin is standing across from Lindner He gives him a
friendly smile He shows no apparent signs of the condition he
is in

MARTIN
Ellen is home But she isnt
feeling well Can I give her a
message

Lindner takes the painting out from under his arm

LINDNER
Oh then I guess that makes my gift
all the more appropriate Maybe
Ill just give it to her real quick
and be on my way again

Martin anxiously fingers the hammer in his hands

MARTIN
Um I dont think thats a good
idea She went to lie down I
think shes already asleep Shes
been pretty busy lately and needs
to rest

86 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

Ellen realizes that there is no way she can untie herself But
slowly she manages to loosen one of the bed planks that she is
tied to - bit by tedious bit

87 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE ENTRANCE AREA - EXT NIGHT
Lindner peeks inside the house past Martin He casually asks

LINDNER
So whats wrong with her

Martin is still playing around with the hammer

MARTIN
Just nerves You know the move
and all that

Lindner realizes that its no use asking further He hands
over the picture

LINDNER
Well then Would you please give
this to her for me Tell her Id
like to talk to her when shes
feeling better And tell her I
dont want to run away anymore
Shell understand what I mean

MARTIN
Sure Ill tell her

The old policeman walks to his car and climbs inside
Martin smiles and waves him good-bye
88 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT
Ellen has finally made it She manages to disconnect the
plank
She quickly tears the gag out of her mouth and yells as loud as
she can
ELLEN
(screams)
Help Help Im in here Help me

She listens if anyone heard her calling

Its useless Lindner has already started his car and drives
off The sound of his car engine fades away in the distance

Ellen is desperate
89 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Martin heard Ellens calling He grins self-consciously and
locks the house door Then he reaches for a board leaning
against the wall He takes a nail out of his pocket and starts
to nail the door shut

CUT TO

90 LINDNERS CAR COUNTRY ROAD - EXT NIGHT

Karl Lindner is driving towards Goldmoor He is lost in
thought Something about the whole situation seemed strange to

him but he cant put his finger on it

He brakes and looks back toward the house once more (a moment
of hope for Ellen)

But then he shakes his head and steps on the gas pedal again
The car drives off into the distance

CUT TO

91 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

Ellen gets rid of the rest of her ropes immediately jumps up
and races to the door

She checks the door its locked She peeks through the
keyhole

The key is sticking in the opposite side of the door We hear
Martin hammering downstairs

Ellen has an idea - an ancient trick from childhood days
There is a book on the bedside table She tears out a page and
slides it underneath the door below the door lock

There is a can of nails on the floor which Martin left behind
Ellen takes out a nail and uses it to poke around in the
keyhole

She pushes the key out of the lock The key falls to the
floor but it lands next to the sheet of paper

Ellen pulls the book page in under the door - no key

ELLEN
(quietly)
Damn

She presses her face flat against the floor and looks
underneath the door crack
There on the other side is the key
Suddenly the hammering stops

Ellen holds her breath

92 LIVING ROOM - INT NIGHT

The living room windows are all nailed shut Martin
prepares to attach the last board He reaches into his pocket
- no more nails

93 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

The box of nails is lying on the bedroom floor Ellen
senses that she is running out of time She moves faster

She pushes the book page under the door again and tries to
maneuver it underneath the key

94 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Martin comes out of the living room and heads for the
hallway

95 BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

-Ellen has it She has managed to get the key on top of the
sheet of paper Carefully she pulls it in under the door
She picks it up and pushes it into the lock

96 HALLWAY - INT NIGHT

Martin comes up the stairs He heads for the bedroom When
he sees the open door he stops

He hesitates for a moment looks around
Then he carefully approaches the door

MARTIN
Is somebody trying to run away
here Darling Im really
disappointed How can we ever have
a trusting marriage if you keep
running away from every conflict

Martin has reached the bedroom door

MARTIN
You little hardhead I

At that moment the door slams into him A loud crunch The
wooden door hits him right in the head Martin is knocked to
the floor

Ellen comes running out of the bedroom She has a wooden plank
in her hands She wants to make sure that the job is done
right and clobbers Martin until he stops moving
Then she sprints to the staircase and runs down the steps
97 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Ellen runs to the barricaded house door She shakes at the
boards but they are down tight No matter how hard Ellen

tries its impossible for her to loosen them

Horrified she searches for another way out She runs to the
living room door and looks inside the room

98 LIVING ROOM - INT NIGHT

All of the windows are barricaded There is no chance to
escape

99 HALLWAY - INT NIGHT

Martin regains conscience His head is wounded and bleeding
He scrambles to his feet

MARTIN
No matter what you do Ellen
you dont stand a chance Were
not leaving this place anymore

100 LIVING ROOM - INT NIGHT

Ellen looks around helpless We hear Martins voice coming
from upstairs

MARTIN (0S)

Never again

She discovers the remote control for the TV And gets an idea
She grabs it and runs out of the room

101 KITCHEN - INT NIGHT
Ellen flees into the kitchen The windows are all nailed shut
here too Ellens heart is beating up to her neck She jerks
open a drawer and takes out a big kitchen knife
We hear Martins footsteps coming down the staircase
MARTIN (0S)

Its like you always wanted

Us together Well make it through

anything no matter how rotten the

situation is

Ellen squats next to the door frame

102 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT
Martin is walking down the last couple of steps Out of the
corner of his eyes he notices the open kitchen door

MARTIN
Have you ever wondered why it
hasnt been working out between us
since it all happened Ive asked
myself that question And you know
what the answer to that is It was
never real All just a big lie

While he speaks Martin slowly moves toward the kitchen
103 KITCHEN - INT NIGHT

Martin has almost reached the kitchen
Quivering Ellen pushes a button on the remote control

104 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

and the television jumps on in the living room behind
Martin The loud NOISE startles him he spins around

Martin smiles and taps the hammer in the palm of his hand
Then he heads towards the living room

MARTIN
What you loved was something
totally different The successful
author Martin Straub Mr
Cherry-red Tears - you married a
goddamned book
Martin disappears in the living room

105 KITCHEN - INT NIGHT

Ellen sees her chance and takes it She runs out of the
kitchen

106 ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Martin sprints out of the living room He is after her
107 HALLWAY - INT NIGHT

reaches for the telephone next to the computer

CUT TO
109 LINDNERS BEDROOM - INT NIGHT

The lights are off in Lindners bedroom
Karl is lying in bed with his eyes open staring at the
ceiling His wife notices it

MRS LINDNER
You went to see the Straubs today

Lindner doesnt answer The look in his eyes says it all
MRS LINDNER
I know you have something on your

mind What is it

He hesitates Sighs Finally he says it

LINDNER
I think its starting again
You know there was something

peculiar If only I knew

MRS LINDNER
Peculiar You mean like back

LINDNER
Yes something was

Suddenly it hits him

LINDNER
My God the hammer

He jumps out of bed and into his clothes

MRS LINDNER
Hammer

LINDNER
How could I fail to notice that
- I have to go

He hesitates looks back at his wife

LINDNER
Im sorry honey

It is hard for Mrs Lindner to let her husband go But she
understands

MRS LINDNER
Go ahead I know you have to do
this

CUT TO
110 STUDY - INT DAY

Ellen dials the emergency number for the police and races to
the window She looks down - its quite a ways down and at
the bottom hard stone pavement

The phone RINGS at the other end of the line

Martin rumbles against the door to the study He is trying to
get inside

111 HALLWAY - INT NIGHT

Martin is standing in front of the closed door to the study
shaking the door handle He listens

MARTIN
Come on

112 STUDY - INT NIGHT
Ellen still hasnt gotten through to the police
MARTIN (0S)

I know what youre up to You

dont think thats going to work

Ellen desperately looks around the room searching for a way
out She catches sight of the activated computer There is a
text flickering on the slightly demolished monitor

Finally someone answers the phone at the police station

TELEPHONE VOICE (0OS)
Police headquarters Webber

Ellen excitedly speaks into the phone

ELLEN
Ellen Straub here You have to
help me
113 HALLWAY ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Martin runs down the stairs to the entrance area He heads
straight for the distributor box next to the cellar door
One well-aimed blow and the gray telephone box is demolished

114 STUDY - INT NIGHT
ELLEN
please come right away My

address is

CLICK The conversation is cut off The line is dead
But Ellen hardly notices it anymore Her eyes are glued to the
monitor Something about it has drawn her full attention

Her name is written on the monitor screen Ellen begins to
read in disbelief

ELLEN

(reads)
Ellen woke up from the sound of
the door She barely managed to
raise her head in order to see who
the visitor might be His back
turned to Ellen the man pulled a
wheelchair into the hospital room
When he turned around she
recognized him with horror
Martin

Ellens eyes grow wider with every word she reads The text
abruptly stops here

Martin must have known everything Her whole story everything
that happened to her is described in his new novel

ELLEN
What the hell

From outside we hear Martins voice loud and clear He
finishes her sentence for her

MARTIN
-is going on here

Before Ellen has a chance to give the situation a thought the
door breaks open The door frame splinters Martin simply
kicked the door in

MARTIN
The final chapter will finish
tonight I bet you cant wait to
find out how the story ends

Ellen grabs the knife and backs away

ELLEN
My God Martin I dont understand
all this How is it possible

Slowly and threateningly Martin comes closer In his hands
the hammer

MARTIN
Do you like my new book A real
page-turner isnt it I can just
see the critics Martin Straub is
back And better than ever
Ellen is backed up against the wall She raises the knife
against him

ELLEN
Stay where you are Not one step
closer

Martin isnt fazed that easily

MARTIN
You still dont understand do you
Today is the last day Your day
Ellen

With this he jumps up to her quick as lightning He grabs
the knife by the blade and twists it out of Ellens hand -
without the slightest feeling of pain

He firmly pulls Ellen towards the door They pass by the desk
with the computer Ellen sees the electric cord for the
computer on the floor

With a swift move of her foot she tears at the cable pulling
the computer off of the desk It falls to the floor

Martin screams in rage For a second he is distracted
Ellen takes the opportunity to tear herself loose

115 HALLWAY ENTRANCE AREA - INT NIGHT

Terrified Ellen races down the stairs She is looking for a
way out

Martin is close on her heels In the entrance hall he gets
hold of her

But Ellen manages to break loose again But doing so she
slips Falls

And trips through the open cellar door
116 CELLAR - INT NIGHT
down the stairs
Ellen crash-lands in brackish brown water The cellar is
flooded ankle-deep with swamp water It is seeping in through

the crevices in the walls

ELLEN
The moor

Martin walks up to her threateningly Ellen scrambles to her
feet She is hurt But Martin walks past her and steps into

the center of the dark cellar

Ellen glances back at the cellar door which is still open
Suddenly an invisible force slams it shut

MARTIN
I told you there is no way out
He wont let you go

ELLEN
HE Whom do you mean-

Instead of answering he gently puts his finger on her mouth
MARTIN
(quietly)
Shh Dont you hear that
She looks around
Then she hears it The room is filled with quiet WHISPERS

growing louder and louder - countless voices - the voices of
children

MARTIN
Its important - he knows the last
chapter

ELLEN

Your book - thats why you were
always in the cellar

Just then a figure steps out of the darkness It is their
little son Thomas Although he does not move his lips he
seems to be the source of the whispers

He stands next to Martin who lays his arm around the boys
shoulder

MARTIN
Now look at this young man He
supports me in what I do - quite
the opposite of you

Terrified Ellen stares at Thomas She watches a thin strand
of mud flow out of the boys shoulder and - against the laws
of gravity - it crawls up over Martins hand Martin does not
seem to notice it

MARTIN
You know Tommi wants me to become
the man I used to be

ELLEN
(laughs bitterly)
So hes dictating you a new
bestseller Whatever that is its
not our son

Martin leans down to the childs figure and brings his ear
close to Thomas mouth The boy seems to be whispering

something in his ear

ELLEN
(sharply)
Martin dont you understand
Tommi is dead This it knows
our weaknesses and its using them
to bring us apart

Martin stays leaned down to Thomas and listens He throws a
stealthy glance at Ellen

MARTIN
Im afraid he doesnt like you very
much

Martin smiles triumphantly He reaches into the water and
pulls out a metal pipe

He threateningly moves closer to Ellen She backs away until
she finds herself backed up against the wall

Ellen looks around - there is no where to run But she tries
anyway She wants to make a run for it

But Martin is faster He grabs hold of her Ellen slips and
lands in the water

MARTIN
Weve played this game long enough

He mercilessly pushes Ellens head under water She tries to
put up a fight but she doesnt stand a chance

MARTIN
How sad Drowned like all the
others But thats the way its
got to be in a real horror novel
I know what youre thinking No
happy end - itll never sell But
to hell with commerce

Ellen manages to fight her way above the waters surface She
gasps for air Her eyes catch sight of the old shelf crammed
full with all sorts of junk standing within reach of her feet

ELLEN

Its lying dont you see This is
all an illusion It lied to us and
to all of those who were here
before us

Martins eyes are beaming with hate He does not notice Ellen
kicking for the shelf It slightly tips forward then back
against the wall again

MARTIN
Ill tell you what really was an
illusion Romantic family life by
the side of your successful author
Sorry if I wasnt able to live up
to your high expectations
princess

Ellen tries to get through to whatever is left of Martin

ELLEN
It wasnt your fault you hear

Ellen gets another good kick against the shelf - it tips over
and collapses over Martins head Ellen grabs the chance to
free herself

Martin furiously thrusts the shelf aside There is an ugly
wound on his forehead

ELLEN
Tommi is dead you hear
But you and me were alive

Again Ellen is backed up against the wall Martin steps up to
her He is still holding the metal pipe

MARTIN
Be quiet

Suddenly he strikes her with the pipe He grabs Ellen by the
throat and pushes her against the wall

ELLEN
I love you Martin

For a short moment something seems to break inside of Martin
But then he tightens his grip on her neck again
Ellen is dazed but she is not afraid any more

ELLEN
Then kill me because With you
my life began and with you shall it

end

All of a sudden some of Martins strength seems to fail His
look freezes A single BLACK TEAR runs out of the corner of
his eye

Ellen grabs the metal pipe and shoves Martin away

She jumps over to Thomas

ELLEN
I love you Dont let a lie come
between us Look at this

and slashes the pipe at him

The metal penetrates the figures body and destroys the
illusion The facade of the little boy dissipates into mud
For a second Ellen believes to have seen the hideous figure of
a swamp corpse but the creature instantly melts into the muddy
water covering the cellar floor

At this very instant a loud roll of thunder echoes throughout
the house

Martin abruptly loses all of his strength More and more
liquid begins to flow out of his eyes The strands of mud
slither down his body like countless snakes and vanish into the
swamp water

The house begins to quake More and more mud seeps in through
the cracks The cellar slowly floods The walls quiver

Ellen runs to the door It is shut tight - there is no way
out

The moor is rising Ellen grabs Martin who is still
unconscious and about to drown She tries to wake him up

ELLEN
Martin We have to get out of
here

There is a sudden noise Ellen jumps

Something has started to move in the back corner of the cellar
A dark something arcs out of the water for a short moment It
isnt over yet

ELLEN
My God

She vigorously tries to wake Martin but he does not react

The thing is coming closer It languidly rolls forward
Its shape remains hidden underneath the waters surface

Ellen feverishly searches for a way out She notices the small
cellar hatch

The house quakes more violently dust flakes down from the
ceiling Ellen realizes that the entire house is slowly
sinking into the ground And at the same time the moor is
rising dangerously high

n

e grabs Martin by the shoulders With all of her strength
she somehow manages to pull him up onto a pile of crates below
the cellar hatch

The black thing is coming closer It rises up out of the moor

Ellen tries to heave Martin outside through the hatch - but she
is not strong enough Still she puts up a desperate fight
against the odds

The already small opening of the hatch is growing smaller and
smaller The tremendous foundations of the house are sinking
deeper and deeper into the ground

Suddenly a hand reaches in through the hatch and grabs a hold
of Martin

Ellen starts She looks outside Its Lindner
LINDNER

Hurry we dont have much time

Lift him up higher
Ellen pushes Martin a little bit higher Behind her an
amorphous black mass is rising up out of the swamp water
Numerous strands of mud branch out of it and begin to grope for
Ellen
One of the tentacles wraps itself around Ellens foot
Ellen notices it but cant do anything about it

With one strong jerk Lindner tugs Martin out of the cellar

At the same time Ellen loses hold on the crate She is torn
downward and disappears under water

Lindner sticks his head in through the hatch
LINDNER
(shouts)
Ellen
A brief moment of hesitation - then the old policeman
determinedly climbs down into the cellar By now the moor has

risen almost to his waist

Lindner wades through the thick liquid The surface is smooth
- no sign of Ellen

Then she suddenly dives back up gasping for air

Lindner immediately grabs her arm and helps her toward the
hatch

ELLEN
Its right behind me

Lindner keeps calm
LINDNER
Dont worry It only has power

over us if we run away

He helps Ellen up onto the crates Carefully she climbs out
through the hatch She hears Tommis voice behind her

THOMAS
Mommy
She is tempted to look back But Lindner stops her from doing
it

LINDNER
No Dont look back

THOMAS
Mommy

The hatch the last possible exit into freedom is slowly
shrinking to a narrow slit

Ellen reaches out her hand to Lindner

ELLEN
Come Quick

Lindner climbs onto the crates

Again the house quakes Single bricks break out of the walls
and ceiling

Ellens curiosity wins over reason She takes a last look into
the cellar

There - in the dark back corner of the cellar - she sees
shriveled figures with hollow eyes watching the two of them in

silence Swamp corpses

Lindner notices her horror but still remains calm He starts
to climb out through the window hatch

117 IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT NIGHT

Once Lindner is safely outside Ellen immediately rushes over
to Martin

ELLEN
Martin

Martin seems to be regaining conscience He opens his eyes

Ellen wants to say something but the thunder in the background
suddenly swells up to an infernal noise

Walls collapse bricks and rubble crash down - the entire house
is swallowed by the depths of the moor

The three watch with open-mouthed horror
Then silence
Ellen leans over to her husband

Martin is still totally worn out He moans
MARTIN
Smog

Ellen musters him confused

ELLEN
What

MARTIN
I have a yearning for smog
cars and many many people
A real dirty big city
What do you think

Ellen gently strokes his cheek

ELLEN
Youre back

Martins eyes are still glued to the spot where the house used
to be He is still a bit disoriented

MARTIN
How did you get me out of there

ELLEN
I wouldnt have made it by myself

She looks at Lindner

LINDNER
You were right You can never run
away from the past Especially if
it scares you

Ellen nods her head

Then she turns back to Martin They look at each other for a
long moment Then she puts her arms around him and kisses
him Its all over now

Theres something else Ellen wants to say to Lindner But when
she turns around she finds that hes already walked a bit
away He is going to his car

ELLEN
Mr Lindner

The old policeman stops by his car

ELLEN
Thank you

Lindner smiles Then he steps into his car and drives away
Ellen helps Martin to his feet

ELLEN
Can you walk
Martin is in pain but brave

MARTIN
No problem

He takes a step but then he flinches with pain The movement
hurt

MARTIN
For Gods sake what happened to
me

ELLEN

You dont remember
Martin shakes his head

ELLEN
Its a long story

Arm in arm the two of them stagger to their car which is
parked next to the entrance gate the last remnant of the
house

They get into the car and drive off

The car slowly vanishes in the distance leaving behind the
vast swampy landscape where there was once a house

FADE TO
118 APARTMENT HOUSE IN THE CITY - EXT DAY

A beautiful old building located by a park in the city Ellen
and Martin live in the penthouse

Text chart l year later
119 APARTMENT - INT DAY

Ellen is standing by the window looking over the small city
park She looks happy
Martin joins her at the window and hugs her

MARTIN
What a sight A few trees a
couple of ducks in the pond

Ellen laughs They are about to kiss when suddenly the
doorbell RINGS

ELLEN
Are you expecting company
Martin shrugs his shoulders and walks to the door He opens
to Paul and Claudia

PAUL AND CLAUDIA
Surprise

Paul is carrying a package under his arm He walks straight
past Martin to Ellen Martin and Claudia follow him

PAUL

PAUL

Martin plays the ball back to her
MARTIN

and the two of them get really
mad

120 APARTMENT HOUSE IN THE CITY - EXT DAY

We see the four of them standing behind the large window of

it
Ellen and Martins apartment The camera pans farther and
farther away from them over the park

They keep the joke running

ELLEN

The voices slowly fade with the cameras growing distance
PAUL
Okay okay I get the message

suggestion you know

The camera travels further away over the big city and its
ever-busy activities

- THE END -
