THE BIG LEBOWSKI

We are floating up a steep scrubby slope We hear male voices
gently singing Tumbling Tumbleweeds and a deep affable
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliots perhaps

VOICE-OVER
A way out west there was a fella
fella I want to tell you about fella
by the name of Jeff Lebowski At
least that was the handle his lovin
parents gave him but he never had
much use for it himself This
Lebowski he called himself the Dude
Now Dude thats a name no one would
self-apply where I come from But
then there was a lot about the Dude
that didnt make a whole lot of sense
to me And a lot about where he
lived like- wise But then again
maybe thats why I found the place
sdurned innarestin

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at
twilight stretches out before us

VOICE-OVER

They call Los Angeles the City of
Angels I didnt find it to be that
exactly but Ill allow as there are
some nice folks there Course I
cant say I seen London and I never
been to France and I aint never
seen no queen in her damn undies as
the fella says But Ill tell you
what after seeing Los Angeles and
thisahere story Im about to unfold--
wal I guess I seen somethin ever
bit as stupefyin as yad see in any
a those other places and in English
too so I can die with a smile on my
face without feelin like the good
Lord gypped me

INTERIOR RALPHS

It is late the supermarket all but deserted We are tracking
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the
dairy case He is the Dude His rumpled look and relaxed
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their
expiration dates

VOICE-OVER
Now this story Im about to unfold
took place back in the early nineties--
just about the time of our conflict
with Sadm and the Eye-rackies I
only mention it cause some- times
theres a man--I wont say a hee-ro
cause whats a hee-ro--but sometimes
theres a man

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of
milk He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs

VOICE-OVER
And Im talkin about the Dude here--
sometimes theres a man who wal
hes the man for his timen place
he fits right in there--and thats
the Dude in Los Angeles

CHECKOUT GIRL

She waits arms folded A small black-and white TV next to
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with
helicopter rotors spinning behind him

GEORGE BUSH
This aggression will not stand
This will not stand

The Dude peeking over his shades scribbles something at
the little customers lectern Milk beads his mustache

VOICE-OVER
and even if hes a lazy man and
the Dude was certainly that--quite
possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
County

The Dude has his Ralphs Shoppers Club card to one side and
is making out a check to Ralphs for sixty-nine cents

VOICE-OVER
which would place him high in the
runnin for laziest worldwide--but
sometimes theres a man sometimes
theres a man

EXTERIOR RALPHS
Long shot of the glowing Ralphs There are only two or
three cars parked in the huge lot

VOICE-OVER
Wal I lost mtrain of thought here
But--aw hell I done innerduced him
enough

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot

Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk
The two mens footsteps echo in the still of the night

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points

DUDE
Its the LeBaron

DUDES HOUSE

The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow
court He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small
leatherette satchel in the other He awkwardly hugs the
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door

INSIDE
The Dude enters and flicks on a light

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it leaving a
hole

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small
bathroom the satchel once again taking away a piece of
doorframe His head is plunged into the toilet The paper
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the
floor

The Dude blows bubbles

VOICE
We want that money Lebowski Bunny
said you were good for it

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet The Dude blubbers and
gasps for air
VOICE
Wheres the money Lebowski

His head is plunged back into the toilet

VOICE
Wheres the money Lebowski

The hands haul him out again dripping and gasping

VOICE
WHERES THE FUCKING MONEY SHITHEAD

DUDE
Its uh its down there somewhere
Lemme take another look

His head is plunged back in

VOICE
Dont fuck with us If your wife
owes money to Jackie Treehorn that
means you owe money to Jackie
Treehorn

The inquisitor hauls the Dudes head out one last time and
flops him over so that he sits on the floor back against
the toilet

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand

Looming over him is a strapping blond man

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly
and walks over to a rug

CHINESE MAN
Ever thus to deadbeats Lebowski

He starts peeing on the rug

The Dudes hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his
sunglasses

DUDE
Oh man Dont do--

BLOND MAN
You see what happens You see what

happens Lebowski

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses
DUDE
Look nobody calls me Lebowski You

BLOND MAN

Bunny
DUDE

Bunny Look moron
He holds up his hands

DUDE
You see a wedding ring Does this
place look like Im fucking married
All my plants are dead

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel He pulls out a
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious
native

BLOND MAN
The fuck is this

The Dude pats at his pockets takes out a joint and lights
it

DUDE
Obviously youre not a golfer

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile

BLOND MAN
Woo

The Chinese man is zipping his fly

Yeah

BLOND MAN

millionaire

Uh

They both look around

BLOND MAN

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger
and peeks over them

DUDE
Hey At least Im housebroken

The two men look at each other They turn to leave

woo
Fuckin waste of time

The blond man turns testily at the door

BLOND MAN
Thanks a lot asshole

ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO
BOWLING PINS
Scattered by a strike

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins
flying bowlers hoisting balls balls gliding down lanes
sliding feet graceful releases ball return spinning up a
ball fingers sliding into fingerholes etc

The music turns into boomy source music coming from a distant
jukebox as the credits end over a clattering strike

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench

MAN
Hot damn Im throwin rocks tonight
Mark it Dude

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud He has dark worried
eyes and a goatee Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves
cut off over an old bowling shirt This is Walter He
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he
addresses the Dude at the scoring table

The Dude

also holding a large plastic cup of Bud

some of its foam on his mustache

WALTER
This was a valued rug

He elaborately clears his throat

to reveal that the plaque from Variety Clubs International
honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR

Distantly we hear a dolorous soprano Brandt talks back
over

HIS SHOULDER

BRANDT
Weve had some terrible news Mr
Lebowski is in seclusion in the West
Wing

DUDE
Huh

Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors The music
washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey
Lebowski a blanket thrown over his knees stares hauntedly
into a fire listening to Lohengrin

BRANDT ANNOUNCES AMBIGUOUSLY

BRANDT

Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around

LEBOWSKI

I received this fax this morning

Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and
hands it to the Dude

LEBOWSKI
As you can see it is a ransom note
Sent by cowards Men who are unable
to achieve on a level field of play
Men who will not sign their names
Weaklings Bums

THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX

CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS NO FUNNY STUFF
DUDE
Bummer

Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude

LEBOWSKI
Brandt will fill you in on the
details

He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire
Brandt tugs at the Dudes shirt and points him back to the
hall

HALLWAY

The sopranos singing is once again faint Brandts voice
is hushed

BRANDT
Mr Lebowski is prepared to make a
generous offer to you to act as
courier once we get instructions for
the money

DUDE
Why me man

BRANDT
He suspects that the culprits might
be the very people who uh soiled
your rug and youre in a unique
position to confirm or uh disconfirm
that suspicion

DUDE
So he thinks its the carpet-pissers
huh

BRANDT

Well Dude we just dont know
BOWLING PINS

We see Quintana in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater
walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging
the bell

The VOICE-OVER conversation continues

DUDE
Huh

WALTER
When he moved down to Venice he had
to go door-to-door to tell everyone

The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man
looks dully out at Quintana who looks hesitantly up

WALTER

They both look up

the lanes

Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a

windbreaker with a racing stripe and Jesus stitched on the
He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball
(perhaps a Sylvia Wein) Behind him stands his
OBrien a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair

WALTER
Eight-year-olds Dude

DUDES BUNGALOW

We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug
His eyes are closed He wears a Walkman headset Leaking
tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an
intermittent clatter

In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE
BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987

The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall
rumbling down the lane On its impact with the pins the
Dude opens his eyes

He screams

A blonde woman looms over him Next to her a young man

in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards

the carrier

The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends his head
thunking back onto the rug

A million stars explode against a field of black We hear
the La-la-la-la of The Man in Me

The black field dissolves into the pattern of the rug
he rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of the city of
Los Angeles at twilight moving below us at great speed

The Dude is flying over the city his arms thrown out in
front of him the wind whipping his hair and billowing his
bowling shirt He looks up

Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away riding on the
Dudes rug like a sheik on a magic carpet She is outpacing
us growing smaller

The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices
that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand

His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic
implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its
weight abruptly snapping his arm down and him after it He
is falling From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down
toward the city dragged by the ball

A reverse looking up shows the Dude hurtling toward us
out of the inky sky his eyes wide with horror Led by
the bowling ball he zooms past the camera leaving us in
black

We hear a distant rumble like thunder Dull reflections
materialize in the darkness They are glints off the shiny
surface of an oncoming bowling ball

We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of
a ball return and the gleaming bowling ball is being
regurgitated up at us overtaking us

The Dude looks up up up at the looming ball its mass
rolling a huge shadow across his face

The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward
us --finger holes

The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us engulfing
us once again in black

The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a
bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in
the thumbhole of the rolling ball

We see the receding bowler spinning away It is the blonde
woman performing her follow-through

Floor spins up at us and then away ceiling spins up and
away the length of the alley with pins at the end floor
ceiling approaching pins again and again

We hit the pins and clatter into blackness We hear pins
spin hit each other and drop

We hear an irritating insistent beeping

FADE IN

We are close on the Dude upside down As the picture fades
in the bowling noises continue but filtered and faint

They come from the Dudes Walkman the headset of which is
now askew with one arm off his ear

As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put
him right side around His head is now resting against
hardwood floor not rug

DUDE
Oh man

He raises himself onto his elbows and massages the
red lump on his jaw The beeper on his belt is
blinking red in sync with the continuing irritating beeps

WIDE ON THE ROOM

An end table is upset but otherwise the furniture is
in place The rug is gone

The Dude looks around The bowling sounds continue
The beeps continue

The phone starts to jangle
TRACK

We push Brandt down the familiar marble hallway
Again there is a distant aria Brandt throws out a
wrist to look at his watch

BRANDT
They called about eighty minutes
ago They want you to take the money
and drive north on the 4 5 Theyll
call you on the portable phone with
instructions in about forty minutes
One person only or Id go with you
They were very clear on that one
person only What happened to your
jaw

DUDE
Oh nothin you know

They have reached the little desk outside of the big
Lebowskis office Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key
and takes out an attache case He hands this to the Dude
along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case

BRANDT
Heres the money and the phone
Please Dude follow whatever
instructions they give

DUDE
Uh-huh

BRANDT
Her life is in your hands

DUDE
Oh man dont say that

BRANDT
Mr Lebowski asked me to repeat that
Her life is in your hands

DUDE
Shit

BRANDT
Her life is in your hands Dude
And report back to us as soon as
its done

DUDES CAR

We pan off the Dude driving to his point of view through
the front windshield The headlights play over Walter
standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK
SECURITY Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt the
fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look
oddly like a commuter He also holds an irregular shape
bundled in brown wrapping paper

The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dudes door
and hands in the briefcase

WALTER
Take the ringer Ill drive

The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over

DUDE
The what

WALTER

The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through
as the car starts rolling

The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from

grab the laundry

Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out
over the road

WALTER

Walter rolls out with his parcel giving a loud grunt as he
hits the pavement The car swerves and lurches and the Dude
cursing takes the wheel

OUTSIDE

Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT--muzzle
flashes tear open the wrapping paper

INSIDE THE CAR

The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel

OUTSIDE
The car clunks and screams around in a skid

INSIDE

The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something
OUTSIDE

As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money The
front of his car is crumpled into a tree The car body saps
back to the left where the rear wheel has been shot out

WALTER is just rising from the ground massaging an
injured knee

The Dude runs up the road toward the bridge
frantically waving the satchel in the air

DUDE
WE HAVE IT WE HAVE IT

There is a distant engine roar A motorcycle bumps up onto
the road from the ravine under the bridge and tires
squealing skids around to speed away in the opposite
direction It is closely followed by two more roaring
motorcycles

DUDE
WE HAVE IT We have it

The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road watching
the three red tail lights fishtail away

AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE

WALTER
Ahh fuck it lets go bowling

BOWLING LANE

A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins

WALTER

He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of

molded plastic chairs The Dude listlessly holds the portable

DUDES LIVING ROOM

The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair
fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses Facing him
on the couch are two uniformed policeman one middle-aged
the other a fresh-faced rookie

At the cut the portable phone in the Dudes lap is chirping
The Dude waits for the rings to end When they do

The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct from the
chirp of the portable The Dude makes no move to answer

on

DUDE

FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
Mr Lebowski Id like to see you
Call when you get home and Ill send
a car for you My name is Maude
Lebowski Im the woman who took
the rug

Beep Dial tone

OLDER COP
Well I guess we can close the file
on that one

TRACKING FORWARD

We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown
LA loft A huge unfinished canvas lit by standing
industrial lights dominates one wall The furnishings are
spare given the space On the floor is the Dudes brilliant
rug
We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball The Dude
standing in the middle of the loft looks into the murky
depths of the cavernous space

Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dudes head
As it roars overhead he ducks and spins to watch it pass

We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended
from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the
floor She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush
in the other with which she flicks paint down at the canvas

The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps Two
young men in paint-spattered shorts T-shirts and sneakers
reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track
and haul it back for another push

VOICE
Ill be with you in a minute Mr
Lebowski

She rumbles by in another pass

All right well do the blue tomorrow Elfranco Pedro
Help me down

The two men help Maude out of her sling She is naked
except for leather harness straps which ring her breasts
and wrap her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix
look

Does the female form make you uncomfor- table Mr Lebowski

DUDE
Is that what thats a picture of

MAUDE
In a sense yes Elfranco my robe
My art has been commended as being
strongly vaginal Which bothers
some men The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable Vagina

DUDE
Oh yeah

MAUDE
Yes they dont like hearing it and
find it difficult to say Whereas
without batting an eye a man will
refer to his dick or his rod or
his Johnson
DUDE
Johnson

MAUDE
Thank you

This to Elfranco who has handed her a robe
All right Mr Lebowski lets get down to cases My father

told me hes agreed to let you have the rug but it was a
gift from me to my late mother and so was not his to give

Now As for this kidnapping--
DUDE
Huh
MAUDE

Yes I know about it And I know
that you acted as courier And let
me tell you something the whole
thing stinks to high heaven

DUDE
Right but let me explain something
about that rug--

MAUDE
Do you like sex Mr Lebowski

DUDE
Excuse me

MAUDE
Sex The physical act of love
Coitus Do you like it

DUDE
I was talking about my rug

MAUDE
Youre not interested in sex

DUDE
You mean coitus

MAUDE
I like it too Its a male myth
about feminists that we hate sex
It can be a natural zesty enterprise
But unfortunately there are some
people--it is called satyriasis in
men nymphomania in women--who engage
in it compulsively and without joy

DUDE
Oh no

MAUDE
Yes Mr Lebowski these unfortunate
souls cannot love in the true sense
of the word Our mutual acquaintance
Bunny is one of these

DUDE
Listen Maude Im sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho but I dont
see what it has to do with--do you
have any kalhua

MAUDE
Take a look at this sir

She is aiming a remote at a projection TV The screen
flickers to life A title card

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS
SECOND CARD

KARL HUNGUS

AND

BUNNY LAJOYA

IN

A THIRD CARD

LOGJAMMIN

The Dude is at the bar a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway
to his glass

From the television set we hear a doorbell ring and then
door opening

On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced
man in blue coyer-alls It is Dieter the floater in
Lebowskis pool

DIETER
Hello Nein dizbatcher says zere

DUDE
Shit I know that guy Hes a
nihilist

MAUDE

And you recognize her of course
The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski
Bunny The TV is in here

DIETER

Bunny This is my friend Shari She just came over to use
the shower

MAUDE
(grimly)
The story is ludicrous

DIETER
Mein nommen iss Karl Is hard to
verk in zese clozes--

Maude switches off the set

MAUDE
Lord You can imagine where it goes
from here

DUDE
He fixes the cable

MAUDE
Dont be fatuous Jeffrey Little
matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career

in pornography nor that she has been banging Jackie
Treehorn to use the parlance of our times However I am
one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation the other
being my father The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts
and--

DUDE
Shit yeah the achievers

MAUDE
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers
yes and proud we are of all of them
I asked my father about his withdrawal
of a million dollars from the
Foundation account and he told me
about this abduction but I tell

you it is preposterous This
compulsive

fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride

DUDE
Yeah but my-

MAUDE
Im getting to your rug My father
and I dont get along he doesnt
approve of my lifestyle and needless
to say I dont approve of his
Still I hardly wish to make my
fathers embezzlement a police matter
so Im proposing that you try to
recover the money from the people
you delivered it to

DUDE
Well--sure I could do that--

MAUDE
If you successfully do so I will
compensate you to the tune of 1 of
the recovered sum

DUDE
A hundred

MAUDE
Thousand yes bones or clams or
whatever you call them

DUDE
Yeah but what about--

MAUDE
--your rug yes well with that money
you can buy any number of rugs that
dont have sentimental value for me
And I am sorry about that crack on
the jaw

The Dude fingers his jaw where the lump from the sap has
all but disappeared
DUDE
Oh thats okay I hardly even--

MAUDE
Heres the name and number of a doctor
who will look at it for you You
will receive no bill Hes a good
man and thorough

DUDE
Thats really thoughtful but I--

MAUDE
Please see him Jeffrey Hes a
good man and thorough

LIMO

The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian listening to
the chauffeur a man of about the same age from whose livery
cap a ponytail emerges

DRIVER
--So he says My son cant hold a
job my daughters married to a
fuckin loser and I got a rash on
my ass so bad I cant hardly siddown

He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian which leaves
milk on his mustache

I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day Id lost a
little money I was down in the dumps

TONY

DUDE

The limo has rolled to a stop The Dude gets out still
holding his drink
TONY
Home sweet home Mr L Whos your

DUDE

His eyes on the rearview mirror Tony jerks a thumb over his
shoulder

He followed us here
The Dude turns to look
HIS POV

Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the
curb In the drivers seat we see a fat mans shape

THE DUDE
He scowls

DUDE
When did he-

The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
nelson by another uniformed chauffeur

SECOND CHAUFFEUR
Into the limo you sonofabitch No
arguments

As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds
his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it

DUDE
Fuck man Theres a beverage here

The waiting limos back door is flung open
INSIDE

The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the
rear The door is slammed behind him

LEBOWSKI

Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude directly across from

LEBOWSKI
(quietly)

No No Mr Lebowski that had not
occurred to me

BRANDT
That had not occurred to us Dude

DUDE
Well okay youre not privy to all
the new shit so uh you know but
thats what you pay me for Speaking
of which would it be possible for
me to get my twenty grand in cash
I gotta check this with my accountant
of course but my concern is that
you know it could bump me into a
higher tax--

LEBOWSKI
Brandt give him the envelope

DUDE
Well okay if youve already made
out the check Brandt is handing
him a letter-sized envelope which is
distended by something inside
BRANDT
We received it this morning

The Dude frowning untucks its flap takes out some cotton
wadding and unrolls it

LEBOWSKI
Since you have failed to achieve
even in the modest task that was
your charge since you have stolen
my money and since you have
unrepentantly betrayed my trust

The wadding undone reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up
inside The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and
starts to unroll the inner package

LEBOWSKI
I have no choice but to tell these
bums that they should do whatever is
necessary to recover their money
from you Jeffrey Lebowski And
with Brandt as my witness tell you
this Any further harm visited upon
Bunny shall be visited tenfold upon
your head

Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents
of the package--a little toe with emerald green nail polish

LEBOWSKI
-By God sir I will not abide
another toe

COFFEE SHOP

The Dude and Walter sit at the counter both staring off
into space both absently stirring their coffee with little
clinking noises

AFTER A LONG BEAT

WALTER

affecting nonchalance

WALTER
Finishing my coffee

DUDES BATHROOM
A dripping noise

The Dude sits in the bathtub staring stuporously a joint
pinched in one hand a washcloth draped over his head

We hear the phone ringing in the other roam
The Dude is staring at his toes which protrude from the
soapy water splayed against the far side of the tub

After the Dudes outgoing message we hear

VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
Mr Lebowski this is Duty Officer
Rolvaag of the LAPD

The Dude looks stuporously up his head swaying

VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
Weve recovered your vehicle It
can be claimed at the North Hollywood
Auto Circus there on Victory

DUDE
Far out Far fuckin out

MESSAGE
Youll just need to present a--

The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds as of
someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine

DUDE
Hunh

He looks blearily at the open doorway

A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is
striding across the living room towards the bathroom

DUDE
Hey This is a private residence
man

The man has entered the bathroom and in stride swings the
cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light Two other

men are entering behind him

The room is dark now except for spill from the living room
the men are backlit shapes

One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small
animal skitters excitedly about the floor

The Dude looks curiously at the small nattering animal

DUDE
Nice marmot
The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it
screaming into the bathtub

The Dude screams

The marmot splashes frantically biting at the Dude ina
frenzy of fearful aggression

FIRST MAN

The Dude screaming grabs the lip of the tub and starts to
hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his
head and squishes him back into the water

SECOND MAN

itself and convulsing in little sneezes

NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS

A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a
large parking lot

POLICEMAN

They have reached the Dudes car The drivers side
exterior has been scraped raw The policeman hands the Dude
a door handle and an exterior rear-view mirror

POLICEMAN

The policeman laughs agreeing broadly

POLICEMAN

The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman
rocking back on his heels his raucous laughter muffled by
the glass

BOWLING ALLEY BAR

White Russian Walter with a beer and Donny eating beer

DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS

DUDE

GARY

The pop song on the jukebox has ended someone puts on
Tumbling Tumbleweeds

A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter
vacated He is middle-aged amiable craggily handsome--Sam
Elliot perhaps He has a large Western-style mustache and
wears denims a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat

TO THE BARTENDER

We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened
the movie

BARTENDER

The Stranger nods

THE STRANGER

MAUDE

good man and thorough

CLOSE SHOT THE DUDE

His eyes are closed a headset on his shirt off Leaking
tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of
Comin Up Around the Bend

Behind him cropped so that we see only a little of his torso
a white-smocked figure taps at the Dudes back After a
moment the figure circles to one side out of frame His
hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the
Dudes ear and as he does so the music issues more strongly

VOICE
Could you slide your shorts down
please Mr Lebowski

The Dudes eyes open

DUDE
Huh No she she hit me right here

VOICE
I understand sir Could you slide
your shorts down please

DUDES CAR

The Dude is driving home A Creedence tape plays The Dude
is sucking down a joint He glances at the rear-view mirror--
and noticing something looks again

HIS POV
A Volkswagon bug is following a lone fat man driving
THE DUDE

His eyes still on the mirror he absently takes the joint
between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it
out the drivers window--except that the window is not open
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car showering
sparks

DUDES CROTCH

The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs
The Dude screams

THE STREET

The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off
to make way horns blaring The car finally spins and comes
to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone
poll

INSIDE THE CAR

The Dude frantically grabs at his door which wont open
and then slides over to push at the passenger door which
also wont open

DUDE
Fuck Me

But he is sitting on the passenger side now away from
the lit butt He looks around for it

Smoke is wisping up from between the Drivers seat cushion
and back cushion

DUDE
Fuckola man

He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions
There is a hissing sound But there is a piece of paper
sticking out from between the cushions

The Dude pulls it out

It is lined spiral notebook paper slightly singed and
dripping beer covered with handwriting In the upper right-
hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers and under that
Mrs Jamtoss 5th Period The theme is titled The Louisiana
Purchase In red ink is a large circled D and some
handwritten marginal comments misspelled words are circled
in red throughout

CRANE JACKSONS FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER

We are behind Walter the Dude and Donny facing the stage
in the background where Allan the Dudes balding landlord
is performing a dance moderne

As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him his voice
hushed so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse
audience

WALTER

There is a rhythmic compressor sound Walter places it and
nudges the Dude At the other end of the living room a man
lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its
midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble
It is an iron lung artificially breathing with distinct
hisses in and out

WALTER
Thats him Dude

necessary to call the police

He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry
WALTER
But that is up to little Larry here

Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out
the homework which is now in a ziploc bag He holds it out
at arms length displaying it to Larry

WALTER

WALTER

Larry

He is heading for the door The Dude puzzled rises to
follow him

WALTER
This is what happens when you FUCK a
STRANGER in the ASS Larry

OUTSIDE
Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like
an enraged encyclopedia salesman Without looking back at

the Dude who follows

WALTER
Fucking language problem Dude

He pops the Dudes trunk flings in the briefcase and takes
out a tire iron
WALTER
Maybe hell understand this

He is walking over to the Corvette

WALTER

shatters

A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over
behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of
the crowbar

He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter

MAN

Glass rains in on a terrified cringing Donny

MAN

ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO
THE DUDES CAR
We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as
it rattles down the freeway Wind whistles through the caved-
in windows

The Dude drives his jaw clenched staring grimly out at the

road Walter beside him and Donny in the back seat munch
on In-and-Out Burgers

Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind

DUDES BUNGALOW

As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four
into the floor just inside and parallel to the front door

DUDE
I accept your apology No I I
just want to handle it myself from
now on No That has nothing to

do with it Yes it made it
home Im calling from home No
Walter it didnt look like Larry
was about to crack

He finishes hammering rises and grabs a straightbacked chair
that stands nearby

DUDE

Well thats your perception

Well youre right Walter and the
unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND
LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE Yeah
Ill be at practice

He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into
place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced
against the two-by-four thus wedging the door closed when
the door is opened--outwards The chair clatters to the
floor

DUDE
Huh

Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in
kicking the chair away

WOO

BLOND MAN

Lebowski

to the deadbeat Lebowski

BLOND MAN
Youre not dealing with morons here

BLACKNESS

Out of the blackness something is falling toward us It is
a woman falling in slow motion her limbs flailing her
mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy She is topless
She falls past the camera leaving blackness then after a
beat reappears rising into the night sky

MALIBU BEACH

A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried
hair wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual
attire are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in
nightmarish slow motion

WIDER

It is a party lit by festive beach lights and standing
kerosene heaters 1960s mainstream jazz of the Mancini-
Brubeck school has been piped down to speakers on the beach

In long shot now the woman rises squealing disappears
into darkness descends into light rises again

A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach
light He is handsome fiftyish wearing cotton twill pants
and a Turnbull and Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the
neck Behind him the woman rises and falls appears and
disappears

MAN

grimly down at the Dude

squishes

as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley
In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski singing

operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song She wears an
armored breastplate and Norse headgear has braided pigtails
and holds a trident

The Dude stands behind her and pressed up against her helps
her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball

The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-
skirts their arms akimbo Busby-Berkley style their legs
turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the
end

But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their
legs--it is the Dude himself levitating inches off the lane
the tools from his utility belt swinging free He is face
down his arms torpedolike pressed against his sides

His point of view shows the lane rushing by below the little
ball-guide arrows zipping by

The Dude twists his body around performing a barrel-roll so
that he is now gliding along the lane face-up

Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing
chorines

The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so
that he is once again gliding face-down He looks forward
and his forward momentum blows back his hair

Coming at us as we go through the last few pairs of legs
are the approaching pins We hit the pins scattering them
and rush on into black

A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless
woman squealing her legs kicking

As she drops out of frame leaving blackness again three
men are entering from the background emerging into a pool
of light It is the Germans advancing ominously wielding
oversized shears which they menacingly scissor

The Dude now standing in a field of black reacts to the
advancing Germans He turns and runs fists pumping

The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of
car-bys The field of black is punctured by headlights
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific
Coast Highway Cars rush by on either side horns blaring

With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast a squad car with
flashing gumballs pulls up

SQUAD CAR
The Dude sits in the back seat his head lolling with the
motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded

DUDE
He was innocent Not a charge was
true And they say he ran awaaaaaay

CHIEFS OFFICE

The Dude is hurled against the chiefs desk which he bounces
off of to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair

His wallet is tossed onto the desk

The chief leans forward takes the wallet and sorts through
it with disgusted incredulity

CHIEF
This is your only ID

He is looking at the Ralphs Shoppers Club card
DUDE
I know my rights

CHIEF
You dont know shit Lebowski

DUDE
I want a fucking lawyer man I
want Bill Kunstler

CHIEF
What are you some kind of sad-assed
refugee from the fucking sixties

DUDE

CHIEF

eject you from his garden party
that you were drunk and abusive

DUDE

CHIEF

Mr Treehorn draws a lot of water in

off name I dont like your jerk-off
face I dont like your jerk- off
behavior and I dont like you jerk-
off --do I make myself clear

The Dude stares

DUDE
Im sorry I wasnt listening

The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude It
hits him in the forehead with a thud the scalding coffee
splashing everywhere

The Chief is already up off his chair rounding the desk

DUDE
--Ow Fucking fascist

The Chief slaps him twice

CHIEF
Stay out of Malibu Lebowski

He kicks the chair out from under the Dude and then starts
kicking at him

CHIEF
Stay out of Malibu deadbeat Keep
your ugly fucking goldbricking ass
out of my beach community

CAB

The Dude in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks
with every bump is gingerly touching at sore spots on his
face and scalp

Peaceful Easy Feeling is on the radio

dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along higher than a

red high-heeled shoe has five painted toes

When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch
Five more toes
DUDES BUNGALOW

The Dude staggers in the open front door one hand pressed
to a lump on his forehead and looks around

DUDE

The door to the bedroom starts to creak open

attention is caught by something down the street

HIS POV

A car is parked halfway down the block We can see the
shape of a fat man in the drivers seat

THE DUDE

Striding purposefully down the street

HIS POV

The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the cars
ignition coughing but the engine will not turn over More

whines and coughs no start

The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him He brings up a
newspaper which he holds before his face
THE DUDE
As he gets to the car He reaches through the open drivers
window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground

He is revved with nervous energy

DUDE
Get out of that fucking car man

The man nervously complies The Dude flinches at the mans
movement as he gets out

The man cringes reacting to the Dudes flinch

He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit He is bald with a

passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and

DENNYS

Four people sit at a booth Dieter Kieffer Franz all in
black leather and a young woman with long stringy blonde
hair wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless
tee-shirt worn thin with age She is apparently braless
and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and
arms
Notable is her camera-side leg which ends in a bandage-
swaddled foot Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of

the bandage The four are arguing loudly in German
They seem very unhappy A waitress enters with a checkpad

and pen

WAITRESS

the back seat

DUDE

THE LEBOWSKI MANSION

Walters car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he
and the Dude get out

Both are gaping off at the front lawn

WALTER
Jesus Christ

THEIR POV

Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a
little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a
palm trunk
TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY

Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny
naked briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing
into the illuminated pool outside Heavy metal music filters
in from a boom box by the pool

Brandt approaching stoops and straightens stoops and
straightens picking up the discarded clothes that run the
length of the hall

from a boom box

Dieter Kieffer and Franz in shiny black leather stand in
a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot Behind them

Watching Dieters charge is caught off-guard The bowling
ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet

He falls back his uzi clattering away

WALTER

twists away as Dieter reaches him grabs Dieters head in
both hands draws Dieters head up to his mouth which closes
on Dieters ear

DUDE

He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate
kicks his leather pants squeaking and popping Franz gives
a loud cry with each kick the Dude leans back throwing his
arms up evading the kicks

WALTER

His jaw is still clamped on Dieters ear Dieter draws his
saber against Walters side drawing blood

Walter doesnt react to the wound Growling as Dieter
screams he worries his ear waggling his head with his jaws
clamped

THE SABER

Dieter drops it

DUDE

Awkwardly circling evading Franzs kicks

WALTER

still worrying the ear With a tearing sound his head and
Dieters separate

DIETER EARLESS SCREAMS

NUSSING
WALTER

ANTI-SEMITE

Bam--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter
for the count

DUDE AND FRANZ

With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to
charge the Dude hands raised to deliver karate blows
As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the boom box swings into
frame to smash him in the face Its volume shoots up

Walter bashes him a few more times over the head The music
screeches to static then quiet Laid out now Franz too is
quiet

All quiet

Walter panting looks around

WALTER
Weve got a man down Dude

With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to
Donny who lies gasping on the ground

The Dude also panting rises and trots over

DUDE

THE DUDE AND WALTER

They sit side by side forearms on knees in a nondescript
waiting area Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off
those of the other They sit They wait

A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters He
eyes the Dudes bowling attire and sunglasses and Walters
army surplus but doesnt make an issue of it

He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk
to whomever wants to take it

WALTER

He takes it opens it puts on reading glasses that sit
halfway down his nose and inspects the bill with his head
pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration Silence
