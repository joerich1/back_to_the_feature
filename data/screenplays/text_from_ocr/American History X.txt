INT BRIEFING ROOM - SAME

he turns it off

RASMUSSEN
Vinyard was quietly released from
Chino on Saturday after three and some
odd years And I think its something

few days

SWEENEY
I dont wanna be an alarmist But
payback is out there I know it is
And in this particular caseif
Vinyard gets poppedmore people will
get popped

RASMUSSEN
Its not exactly LAPD policy but I
want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard

RASMUSSEN
Just for a few days

ANOTHER COP
He doesnt sound like Mr Lovely here
Captain You want us to bust him or
protect him

EXT VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK
As the rain falls we see the Vinyards sitting at the
table Stacey and Murray Rosenberg Doris then
boyfriend who we met earlier round out the clan Stacey

sits close to Derek

DANNY (VO)
And then came October 4th 1993

INT BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM

Doris looks wonderful while Murray mustache and beard
shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away
DANNY (V0)
Things were fine on the homefront My
Mom had a good job but a below average
boyfriend We had a four-bedroom
house that Dad left us with Everyone
was happy

TIGHT ON DEREK Shaved head rolled-up sleeves tattoos
loosened tie LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier His
charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the
crackling rainfall

DANNY (VO)
Everyone but Derek

DEREK
Fuck you Murray White men dont
cruise the streets of LA killing each
other

MURRAY
No You guys make bombs

Derek stares at the man eyes filled with homicide

DEREK

Youre so fucking lame A couple of
cranks in cabins in Montana is not
statistically significant

(then)
White Americans dont take PCP and
drink and drive a hundred and twenty
fuckin miles an hour We pull over
and trust the law

MURRAY
Youre kidding right

DAVINA
(sarcastically)
Dont you know Murray White people
never break the law Were perfect
little angels

DEREK
Thats not what I said Davina

(to the group)
Three different times Rodney King
comes at those officers with the
intent to hurt them To hurt them
Three times But since we see it on
some fucking tampered videotapethe
bleeding heart media makes you believe
that he only comes at them once All
we see is Powell Koon and Wind

hittin him and--

(busting up laughing)
Briseno kickin him in the back of the
fuckin skull with his boot Still
the dumbfucks tryin to get up and
kick their asses Thats how stupid
that motherfucker is Those cops used
textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were
still here hed say the same damn
thing

DORIS
That doesnt make it right

DEREK
Yes it does Yes it does Theyre
cops They are taught to use that
stick and they did

MURRAY
Excessively

DEREK
No Appropriately Appropriately
Cops have been granted a certain
amount of authority by society and
white people unfortunately are the
only ones who acknowledge it I
acknowledge a cops authority

Davina starts to laugh

DAVINA
Look whos talking about respecting
the law Mr KKK here

DEREK
Thats two errors in one sentence
Davina so take a fucking course in
semantics First error--I didnt say
I respect the law I said I respect a
cops authority Second errorIm
not a member of the fuckin low rent
disorganized redneck Ku Klux Klan
Pull your head outta your ass and look
at who youre dealing with

MURRAY
Dont speak to her that way Derek

DEREK
Murray stay out of it Youre not a
member of this family and you never
will be

MURRAY
What the hell does that have to do
with anything

DORIS
(to Derek)
You knowsometimes its hard to
believe I gave birth to you

DEREK
Give thanks to the food on the table
and then believe it Doris

DORIS
We both put food on this table fella

DEREK
True enough The point isif Dan
was walking across the street that
night and Rodney King plowed into him--

DORIS
Can we forget about Rodney King for
chrissake

DEREK
(fiercely continuing)
--while hopped up on Chivas and
PCPyoud consider the force those
cops used to be justified

DORIS
He didnt hit anybody

DEREK
If he did though If that shithead
killed Danyou would have believed
the beating to be justified and so
would everybody else But since he
didnt hit anyoneits Hands Across
America for the son of a bitch

Derek takes a bite of food

DEREK
We are still so hung up in this notion
that we have an obligation to help the
struggling black man and all you
contribute to it Lincoln freed the
slaves a hundred and thirty years ago
Get off your fucking asses

STACEY
Im with you honey All the way

Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter
and looks at her mother Everyone stares at Davina

DAVINA
(to Doris)
May I be excused please

DEREK
Dont interrupt Davina

DAVINA
I didnt interrupt shit

DEREK
The hell you didnt I was listening
to Stacey and then I heard you
Thats called interrupting Wait til
shes finished and you can be excused

DAVINA
Who the hell do you think you are

Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back
of the hair The table JOLTS and plates tumble to zhe

floor

DEREK
You dont know when to shut up

DORIS
Dammit Derek

MURRAY

TIGHT ON DANNY He gets up quickly and tries to pull
Derek off Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with
a BACKHAND dropping him back into a cabinet A crystal
vase with flowers crashes to the floor just missing
Dannys head

MURRAY

DEREK
(to Danny)
What are you thinkin

DORIS
Danny Are you okay

Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek

DEREK

DAVINA

Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and
shoves it in her mouth Me holds the whole piece inside
so she cant spit it out Davina cries as she chokes on
the meat

MURRAY
She cant breathe Derek

DEREK

(grabbing harder)
You can cry all you want Davina Im

DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on
her Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises
his arm like hes actually going to smack his mother

She grabs his arm though forcefully

DORIS
Let go of her hair and get out

Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the
roast beef onto the floor She runs into the back

bedroom crying choking and coughing

DAVINA (0S)
I hate you you fucking asshole

The door slams shut in the background
Danny and Stacey all stare at Derek
