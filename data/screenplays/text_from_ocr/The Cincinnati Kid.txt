pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent
EXT ALLEY - DAY
A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and
them with clubs or other weapons The fighting is
dirty and noisy
INT KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD
The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud
clearly removed from the struggle outside even though
SOUNDS of it are very close coming through window
on the alley In fact the noise is so loud that the
of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance
DEALER

Somebody shut the goddam window Let

a man think
The player nearest the window shuts it The Dealer who
owns the restaurant is the talkative type of poker
Except for THE CINCINNATI KID the other men at the
look like hoods of one sort or another gunmen labor
extortionists what have you The man who fancies
the toughest of them all is named DANNY and he and The
have almost all the money on the table between them
hundred dollars in front of each No other player has
than a few dollars left and now as fifth cards are
there is about forty dollars in the pot Only four men
left in the hand

DEALER
Possible straight gets a --
(deals the card)
-- lovely little four

FIRST PLAYER
On the last hand even you couldnt
give me a break

DEALER
I put the brakes on your straight
didnt I
(he laughs no one
else does he deals
to The Kid)
There you are son a gorgeous deuce

KID
Thanks

DEALER
(deals to Danny)
And our lucky friend from Chicago
gets a queen with his pair of sixes
Little lady make you happy Buster

DANNY

DEALER
Dealer gives himself a --
(deals card and groans)
I might have known
(to Danny)

DANNY
I told you not to call me that
(then as the dealer
turns away)
Cost you --
(counts out his money)
Ninety-four bucks

DEALER
Biggest pot of the whole game I got
to drop

DANNY
(to First Player)
Interested

FIRST PLAYER
Wouldnt call you if I had a pair
highern sixes Which I aint
He turns over his cards leaving it up to The Kid

KID

Dont seem like hed bet out without
something better than the sixes
does it

(fingers hole card as

if to fold)
Cost me every cent Ive won since
yesterday afternoon

(studies Dannys face)
But I tell you I got this stubborn
streak Call the ninety-four dollars

He counts out the money which is almost all he has

DANNY
(indignantly)
You cant have better than a pair of
kings
KID
Oh Im not claiming anything that
fine

(turns over an eight
making a pair of
them)
Just enough to beat the pair of sixes

DANNY
You seen my hole card you bastard
(indicating Dealer)
He was dealing them high

Attending to first things first The Kid has been

pulling in

the pot adding it to his own stake and pocketing the
total

Now as Danny accuses him again The Kid looks him
squarely

in the face

DANNY
You stole that dough

KID
You better watch those loose lips of
yours you want to have any teeth
left behind them -- Buster

DANNY

KID
I called you on account of I didnt
think you had another pair or another
six and I know a punk like you would
get greedy and try and buy the last
hand
He walks off disappearing through a door marked MEN
INT MENS ROOM - THE KID AT MIRROR
He is waiting when the door opens abruptly and Danny
his right hand in his coat pocket The Kids hand goes
his own pocket and as he whirls around a straight
appears in it its blade snapped open Pushing Danny to
wall with one hand he keeps him pinned there with the
in the other while he bolts the door Danny gets his
hand out of the pocket with a gun in it but The Kid

the razor blade against his neck

KID
Drop it

As the gun clatters to the floor and the others force
door The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough
momentum then swings at Dannys middle with his left
dropping him then jumps up on the wash basin and

his way out through a window

The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts
run toward the railroad yards A few moments later
and four other poker players appear and run after him
EXT RAILROAD YARDS - DAY

The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits
Kids pursuers split into two groups to cut him off
they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a
on which a passenger train is bearing down headed for
station His dubious chance of escape depends on his
beyond this track in front of the train which witha
of speed he manages to accomplish just in time The
train divides The Kid from his pursuers and we PAN

The train slowly stops Amid all the atmosphere of

SHOOTER

in another direction She is humming a mountain tune

CHRISTIAN
When we leaving town Kid This week

KID

CHRISTIAN
I thought --

KID

She is surprised by this and in her own hesitant way
curious

CHRISTIAN
You must feel different about it

than you did Saturday

He looks at her fondly and for one fleeting moment of
weakness is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey

it is too sharp a break with tradition
KID
Yeah Im feeling a little different
(TIME LAPSE)
INT KIDS BEDROOM
It is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp
Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the
turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue In
The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed his
closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck

opens his eyes and turns to look at her The movement

her eye and she instantly stops turning the pages

the noise has disturbed him

KID
Its all right You dont have to
toa

on
she

returns
waiting

Not

turning his

shoulder

She waits

She goes

gently so

act like a cat Youre not bothering
me

CHRISTIAN
You want me to turn out the light

KID
No Im overtired thats why I cant
sleep
(sits up and swings
his feet to the floor)
Why cant you sleep

CHRISTIAN

(lightly)
Undertired I guess If a person
rests all day she doesnt have much
to rest up from at night

(stands up)
Why dont you have a nice hot bath
I could give you a rubdown and then
you could have a nice hot bath and
then maybe you could sleep

at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly

KID
Kay Cant hurt to try it

into the bathroom where she turns the water

the tub will take a long while to fill Then

takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and

to the be
for him t
till she
face to t

muscles

droom with it She stands in front of him
o move but The Kid is singularly listless
sets the bottle down does he respond by

he pillow She goes right to work on his
and she seems to know what she is doing

KID
What did you do with yourself this
time

CHRISTIAN
Last night I went to a movie with
The Shooters woman French movie

KID
In French

CHRISTIAN
They had the words in English at the
bottom of the picture But The
Shooters woman knew what they were
saying without it Pigs woman or
somebody told me she went to college

KID
Sure Majored in man-eating

CHRISTIAN
I think maybe she really did go But
I never quite dared to up and ask
her

KID
I didnt know you ran with The
Shooters woman

CHRISTIAN
We got to be kind of friendly when
you both were in that three-day game
down to Cairo Course shes oldern
me

KID
And been around more A lot more
What was the movie like

CHRISTIAN
Weird It wasnt a straight story
where you knew whose side you were
on the way you do in regular
pictures

KID
American pictures

CHRISTIAN
Yeah There were lots of things I
didnt understand

KID
What was it about

CHRISTIAN
Well theres this town in Europe a
long time ago where they get a message
from a Spanish general hes coming

to spend the night with his troops

So all the men are scared silly about
what the soldiers will do to them

KID
Nothing weird about that

CHRISTIAN
But all the wives and daughters tell
the men to go hide somewhere and let
them bargain with the enemy

KID
That dont make much sense

CHRISTIAN
Wait The way they handle it is they
go to bed with the Spaniards And
the next morning the soldiers go off
peacefully and everybodys happy

KID
Including the husbands and fathers
Dont they suspect

CHRISTIAN
Thats part of what I wasnt sure
of I guess they know what went on
but they care more about their safety
and their money than they do about
their honor

KID
Then they got their heads screwed on
straight Honors just an idea You
cant see or feel it and you cant
eat it and you sure as hell cant
get any mileage on it

She slaps him on the rump and straightens up

eyes

into the bedroom The sight of him makes her advance
cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep

The Shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks

into it
he pantomimes to her that he wont be able to hear over
the
radio She seems to regard the request as an imposition
but
she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a
little
before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore

CRAIGIE
We dont know much about you
Christians mother and me

KID
Im whats known as a three-river
man Which just means I go around
playing stud poker wherever I can
find the kind of action Im looking
for

CRAIGIE
You met Christian when she was working
to Hot Springs

KID
Yeah I was playing in this game in
the hotel and she was a waitress in
the coffee shop We went out I told
her I thought she could get a better
job in St Louis

CRAIGIE
Now how did you happen to tell her
that Maybe you run some kind of
employment service on the side

KID
I said it because I wanted her in
St Louis Anyway she made it there
and she called me and we been seeing
each other ever since

CRAIGIE

this
one

KID

CRAIGIE
You two have a fight

Christian find out a few things then

questions

CRAIGIE
I never run across anybody like you
I guess I dont understand gamblers

KID

Thats all right I dont understand
farmers
CRAIGIE
You say things that sound smart

really are smart alecky

KID
Well I cant take into account what
somebodys going to feel every time
I say something

CRAIGIE
Are you a believer

KID
In some things

CRAIGIE
I mean in God

KID
Thats a tough one I dont disbelieve
in Him but I couldnt say I believed
in Him either I guess I just never
paid Him much mind Didnt seem
important

CRAIGIE
God not important

KID
I dont mean what He does isnt
important -- if He exists I mean

its not important to me whether He
exists or not

CRAIGIE
Christian was raised in a Christian
home

KID
s that so I didnt know ---
(then)
m not aware of the difference
(pause)
m not asking permission to marry
Christian you know

f I was the only person Id be

asking it from is her

CRAIGIE
You playing because of money

KID
(after a moment)
Not really
CRAIGIE
Christian said you never was much
worried about money -- I been worried
about money most of my life -- up

until I figured out it wasnt so
important
KID
No its necessary but it isnt so
important

CRAIGIE
Well how come you want to play this
King fella

KID
Ambition -- maybe security like
that

CRAIGIE

Is it aspiration to be the King or
just uncertainty about the future

KID
I aint looking for security if thats
what you mean

CRAIGIE
Not trying to lock something up tight
and nail it down

KID
That would figure into it But that
isnt all of it -- Its important
to me

CRAIGIE

Now son which is more important to
you this king business or Christian

KID
If you got the guts to ask that
question Mr Craigie I guess I got
the guts to answer it Christian if
you came right down to it is not as
important as doing what I have to
do

Craigie has finished piling the manure He puts away
his
shovel

Well son I had to know

(TIME LAPSE)

EXT CRAIGIE PORCH - CRAIGIE AND THE KID - NIGHT

The two men are sitting just outside the kitchen where

Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason

they filled earlier The paste and some of the jars are

inside an open window on a shelf behind the mens

light comes from a kerosene lamp inside

CRAIGIE
Let me get this straight in my head
Cards is all a matter of luck who
gets dealt the best ones

The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a
in his pocket During the next few lines he uses the

paste

on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so
as to

form three double-thick cards One of these has two
faces

another two backs and the third a back and a face

CRAIGIE
So when one of you professional
gamblers sits down with a bunch of
your -- what do you call them --
customers clients

KID
The technical term is suckers Or
marks

CRAIGIE

Their chance of winning is just as
good as yours except if you got a
way to control it who gets what
cards Right

KID
Not right Thats cheating and its
not any part of what were talking
about

CRAIGIE
Then how do you win

KID
Ill show you

He displays his three cards

KID
You see one of these cards is white
on both sides one is red on both
sides and the other is white on one
side red on the other

CRAIGIE
What about it

The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall

KID
This I put the three cards in a hat
and shake them up and then I ask
you to draw one card out blind Put
it face down on the table so neither
of us can see the bottom side

Craigie does as instructed The ensuing dialogue
assumes the

card he picks is red on top if its white the words
red

and white will be reversed in the dialogue

KID
Okay red on top That eliminates
the all-white card right So the
card youve picked is one of two --
the all-red or the red-and-white
One out of two is an even chance an
even-money proposition Right -- you
follow me

CRAIGIE
I think so

KID
So if I said Ill bet you a dollar
to seventy-five cents the other side
of that card is red youd take the
bet wouldnt you

CRAIGIE
Seems like Yeah

KID
And that answer makes you a sucker
Because the odds are two to one the
other side of that card is red and
I ought to be offering you a dollar
to fifty cents instead of seventy-
five

CRAIGIE
But if there are just the two
possibilities

KID

There are three possibilities

(indicating card on

table)
That can be the red side of the red-
and-white card or it can be either
side of the all-red card In two
cases out of three the other side is
red And Id win the bet from you
two out of every three times we made
it

CRAIGIE
(dubiously)
You would
KID

Sure Its obvious when I explain
it isnt it

CRAIGIE
Reckon so Except if theres only
two things that the bottom side can
be red or white --

KID
Take my word for it -- the odds are
two to one And knowing that is the
difference between your gambling man
and your sucker Not who gets the
better cards but who knows what the
proper odds are In a poker game
there can be a million different
situations each with a different
set of odds to figure The man who
ends up winners is the man who knows
when to bet and how much

CRAIGIE
The sucker is still took advantage
of isnt he The gambler knows
something he dont know

KID
Sure -- like if you grow better corn
or raise a cow that gives more milk
than the other guys Or two business
men are in competition or two lawyers
are up against each other in a
courtroom Whatever your line is
the one who wins out is the one who
knows his job better

CRAIGIE
Seems like there should be something
else to it --

KID
There is -- Making the man youre
playing against think hes got the
best hand -- and making him pay to

find out

THE PLAYERS - FEATURING THE KID

The Kid has taken his roll from his pocket and is

how much he is putting out After counting out one

thirty hundreds he distributes the rest in stacks of
twenties tens and fives folding each bill over once

protection against picking up more than one at a time

Melba fills a beer glass from a bottle and serves it to

It always distresses me a man
reaching his middle years and still
having no assurance of next weeks
income

MELBA
I know what you mean I like a man
to have plenty of assurance

The Shooters gaze wanders os CAMERA MOVES to FEATURE
the

objects of his attention who are Lady Fingers Lancey
and

The Kid The two men would like to talk to each other
but

Lady Fingers is monopolizing Lancey and he doesnt
want to

offend her

LADY FINGERS
Spider Man died kind of slow First
he give them a kidney then his gall
bladder and then they taking his
whole damn stomach You remember
Spider Man run the dice table down
at Turks Club to Memphis

LANCEY

LADY FINGERS
He died kind of slow

The Shooter comes to Lanceys rescue

SHOOTER
Need your help Lady Fingers to
make arrangements for food and
shelter

He whisks her away Lancey and The Kid finally facing
each
other alone dont quite know how to begin
LANCEY
Good crowd

KID
Yeah Nice-looking broads

LANCEY
Thats a fact

KID
That was a pretty thing to watch
what you done to Pig with those jacks

LANCEY
Thanks Kid From you thats nice
to hear

KID

When he bet out first he was ready
to think you had them back to back
Even when he bet the size of the
pot he figured there was still a
chance you were laying for him But
when you called him I could see it
in his eyes he thought you had jacks
and tens and I knew you had him
hooked

LANCEY
You knew did you Before I raised

KID
Oh sure I seen what you were pulling
all along

Lancey is a bit taken aback by The Kids confident
assertion
but he manages a smile

LANCEY
You been to Miami Kid

KID
Not yet

LANCEY
Beautiful town lot of loose money
around You ought to come down some
time

KID
You mean it
LANCEY
Sure sure Lot of room down there
Another spot you ought to work someday
is Reno Nevada

KID
I heard

LANCEY
You got to have nerves though So
much going on Action everywhere you
turn You lose the feel of the cards
when youre in so much action day
in day out

KID
Id like to make it out there

LANCEY
Theres different levels of action
there -- youd find yours any kind

you could ask for

KID
I generally stick to stud

LANCEY
Sure sure for eating money But
you know how it is I like to lay
off once in a while and try craps
Nothing serious -- I dont even think
of it as work

KID
Oh I do that Ill take a night off
and shoot a little casino Or even
blackjack

LANCEY
Your age you dont need a regular
vacation every year But me I have
to forget the grind for a couple of
weeks I go to this place near Delray
Beach and the whole time I dont
play anything but bridge

KID
Thats interesting I could go for
bridge if there was a way to do it
without partners
LANCEY
Im not keeping you from your woman
am I

KID
(after a slight
hesitation)
No Were -- shes gone away for a
while Were not sure were looking
for the same thing

LANCEY
Im sorry to hear that

KID
I was hoping Christian would run
with me and wouldnt try to make a
big deal out of it

LANCEY
But she tried

KID
Yeah and now I dont know I dont
figure a man can change his way
because the way I see it a mans
lucky hes got something going for
him that he can hold on to A man
cant change his way for a woman

LANCEY
Nooo a man cant do that

KID
I been wondering if it isnt maybe a
better idea not to look for a fixed
thing Just tie in to something nice
when youre away from the action
and enjoy it and let it wear itself
out

LANCEY
(after a long moment)
Thats very interesting you should
say that Youre pretty young to
have figured things out already

KID
Well she didnt understand how it
was with me and ---

LANCEY
(warmly)
Between us

KID
There aint but a few people I guess
who would understand --

LANCEY
(as The Kid doesnt
finish)
Kid youre the best stud man Ive
seen in 35 years of action You know
that

KID
Well -- thank you

LANCEY
And when it comes to broads which
is getting to be an academic problem --
can look back now to the two or
three I ever considered I might want
to spend the rest of my life with
and you know what I like it
looking back on them that is --
(then)
always got a lot of companionship
out of a good book

KID
ts very educational hearing what
its like for a man your age

LANCEY
Glad to be of help And its good we
had this little talk so I know we
can be friends regardless what
happens

KID
That sounds good to me I didnt
think you was coming in at me like a
grudge match

LANCEY
No room for any kind of emotion in a
fair game of stud I learned that a
long time ago

He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing As
movement brings him fairly close to Christian he

he hasnt kissed her and repairs the omission before

CHRISTIAN
(after the kiss)
I was wondering

THE KID
I got my mind on the cards

CHRISTIAN
I know And I dont want to rattle

to say this I came back because I
figured if it was going to work with
us its silly me sitting home with
Mama while youre playing your big
game I mean if Im any use to you
at all this is when its most
important

To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix feeling
affection and guilt The idea that she can be any use
against Lancey is one he cant grasp

THE KID
Im glad you came Christian You
got as much right here as anybody
(then)
More right I should have said

CHRISTIAN
Should you

THE KID
Hell yes The change I come out
with when I win this one youre
going to be the one to spend it

He moves toward the door
