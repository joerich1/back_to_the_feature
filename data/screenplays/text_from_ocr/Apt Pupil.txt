FADE IN

Through the window of a moving vehicle we see a series of
small middle-class houses This could be any suburban street
in America

INT CITY BUS - DAY

A boy is seated near the back of a moving bus This is TODD
BOWDEN 15 as All-American as they come He stares out at the
other passengers indifferently Then something catches his eye
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY

TITLE SANTO DONATO CA FEBRUARY 1984

Todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an
unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot This is the kind

of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful
suburban community of Santo Donato Todd gets off his bike and
heads up the front steps On the way he bends down to pick up
the LA Times

Two signs in laminated plastic are secured neatly above the
door bell The first reads ARTHUR DENKER The second reads
NO SOLICITORS NO PEDDLERS NO SALESMEN

Todd RINGS the bell Nothing He looks at his watch It is
twelve past ten He RINGS again this time longer Still
nothing Finally Todd leans on the tiny button staring at his
watch as he does so After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING
a voice is heard from within

DUSSANDER (0S)
All right All right Im coming Let it
go

Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle
Then it opens An old man stands behind the screen He is KURT
DUSSANDER aka Arthur Denker Mid-seventies Standing there
in his bathrobe and slippers a cigarette smashed in his mouth
he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein
Dussander stares at Todd who tries to speak but suddenly
cannot

DUSSANDER
(continuing)
A boy I dont need anything boy Cant
you read I thought all American boys could
read Dont be a nuisance now Good day

The door begins to close Todd waits till the last moment
before speaking

TODD
Dont forget your paper Mr Dussander

The door stops Dussander opens it slowly He unlatches the
screen and slips his fingers around the paper Todd does not
let go

DUSSANDER
Give me my newspaper

TODD
Sure thing Mr Dussander

Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door
Quickly almost imperceptibly the old mans eyes survey the
area across the street up and down the sidewalk the boys
bicycle

DUSSANDER
My name is Denker See
(pointing)

Denker Perhaps you cannot read after all
What a pity Good day
As the front door closes Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap

TODD
Bergen-Belsen January 43 to June 43
Auschwitz June 43 to June 44 Then you
went to Patin

The door stops still partly open

TODD (CONTD)
After the war you escaped to Buenos Aires
From 1950 to 52 you were in Cuba and
then From 1952 to 58 I dont know No
one does But in 1965 you popped up in West
Berlin where they almost got you

The door opens wider

DUSSANDER
Listen boy I dont know what is the matter
with you But I dont have time for this
game Now get out of here before I call the
police

TODD
Call them if you want

DUSSANDER
Fine

The heavy door slams shut

TODD
Its okay by me Herr Kommandant Im sure
the police would love to meet the Blood-
fiend of Patin

In a flash the front door is open so is the screen Dussander
is through the doorway and descending upon Todd with the rolled
umbrella raised to strike him Todd stumbles back against the
porch rail

DUSSANDER
You get away from this house God damn you
Ill beat you all the way home

But Todd regains his composure quickly He brushes himself off
and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the
threat he was a few seconds ago

TODD
After 1965 no one saw you again Until I
did Three weeks ago on the downtown bus If
you want to call the cops go right ahead
III wait on the steps
DUSSANDER
Youll do no such thing

TODD

I wont Listen old man if I want to start
screaming right here I will If I want to
ride down to the police station and bring the
cops back myself then I will TI will do
what ever I want Do you understand

(pause)
But if you like I could come in for a
minute We could talk

Pause
DUSSANDER
Id be out of my mind to let an insane boy
like you into my home
Pause

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Is that what you want to come into my home
So be it There is no arguing with crazy
people

Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door He
stops at the threshold of the house and turns He is holding
the screen door open with one leg the front door open with the
other He looks straight ahead A moment later Todd steps
into the house

INT DUSSANDERS HOUSE - DAY

Dussanders home is what you would expect of a single poor old
man Nothing fancy nothing out of the ordinary Todd looks
around perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil
painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle But he
doesnt and moves into the living room where an old picture of
a woman sits framed on an end table

DUSSANDER

My wife She died in 1955 of lung disease
At that time I was working at the Menschler
Motor Works in Essen I was heartbroken

Todds attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a
lampshade next to the photograph He begins to feel it as
though he were inspecting it for something

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Stop that

Todd jumps back a little but then recovers

TODD
Pause

Tell me wasnt it Ilse Koch who made the
lampshades out of human skin

DUSSANDER
Now I dont know what youre talking about

TODD
Sure you do Mr Dussander

DUSSANDER
Denker Denker Denker You dont listen
boy The television has fried your brain

TODD
Your hands are shaking

DUSSANDER
Yes theyre shaking Im old We all
shake You are most tiresome and rude Now
if you have a point I wish youd come to it

TODD
Were in no rush If I thought you had
plans Id say cancel them but since I know
you dont

DUSSANDER
You know nothing of my business --

TODD
What business You sit in that ugly chair
and watch soap operas all day Except on
Friday afternoons when you walk down to the
movie theater And twice a week you take the
bus downtown to do your shopping You always
use the express lane because you never have
more than ten items

DUSSANDER
You have been following me

TODD
Of course I followed you You think I
normally go around to peoples houses and
accuse them of being Nazi fugitives

DUSSANDER
Perhaps for me you made an exception

TODD
No for you I had to be sure For Kurt
Dussander I had to be absolutely certain
-Now I am and thats why Im here

Todd sits on the sofa
DUSSANDER
Oh yes I see now As I am this ex-Nazi
fellow as you say then this must be the
part where I offer you my hidden stash of
gold taken from the mouths of old Jewish
men of course which I keep buried in the
basement Isnt that right boy Well Im
afraid youre wasting your time I have no
money If I did I might even give you some
just to be done with this nonsense

TODD
I dont need money You dont have any
anyway At least I dont think so You
probably had to spend it all to sneak in the
country A good American passport is
expensive on the black market that I know

DUSSANDER
Do you Good for you

TODD
Yes I do I know it all Dussander Youre
my One Great Interest

DUSSANDER
Your what

TODD
My One Great Interest Well not you
personally but well its something I

learned back in eighth grade Our teacher
Miss Harmon she said wed have to find our
One Great Interest in life You know the
thing that would really grab us Once we did
that everything would fall into place Like
hers she said wasnt teaching but
collecting nineteenth-century postcards I
guess theres no money in that so she has to
be a teacher Anyway she told us to start
thinking about it So I did but nothing
happened Until the following summer in
Ronny Peglers garage Thats where I found
it

INT RONNY PEGLERS GARAGE - DAY

Todd and RONNY both 13 rummage through several large boxes in
the corner of the garage We see that the boxes are filled with
old war magazines Ronny tosses several of them to the ground
as he digs for his dads old copies of Penthouse Ronny selects
one Penthouse and rifles through it He discards it a moment
later

RONNY
One of these has three girls doing it at the
same time

But the old war magazines catch Todds attention He picks one
up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages We
see a few of the photographs Nazi storm troopers prisoners
behind barbed wire the ovens

RONNY (CONTD)
I got it Check this out Todd look

TODD
Hang on a sec

As young Todd stares into this secret world his voice comes
in

TODD (CONTD)
It was all there pictures of stuff Id
never seen stuff they never put in the books
anymore especially the ones they give us to
read And here were stacks of them

INT DUSSANDERS LIVING ROOM - DAY

Todd speaks excitedly Dussander very bored clearly indulges
him

TODD
It grabbed me It was just like Miss
Harmon said I couldnt believe it But
there it was the camps the uniforms the
the way they saluted each other But what
am I telling you for You know more about
this stuff than anybody

DUSSANDER
Yes what are you telling me for

TODD
(ignoring him)
Then last year I wrote my big term paper on
Dachau I got an A It was the only A she
gave I mean I always do real well As on
everything Thats why Im accelerated

DUSSANDER
Accelerated

TODD
You know accelerated I skipped two grades
second and ninth I didnt need them
Thats why Im already a junior

Dussander sits
DUSSANDER
I see

TODD
Some kids resent me for it Thats not
important Anyway my paper really floored
my history teacher I guess because I got
through all those books without throwing up
But I learned something I learned that when
you talk about the camps now you have to
remember to sound really disgusted I mean
you cant just say what happened like the
magazines did and leave it at that If I
tried that the teacher would have freaked and
called my parents in

INT RONNY PEGLERS GARAGE - DUSK

Todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old
magazines The door to the house opens and Ronny looking
cross pokes his head out

RONNY
Todd your moms on the phone She says you
have to come home for dinner Todd

Todd lost in the sea of old photographs doesnt notice Ronny
at first Then he looks up at him In his eyes is a glint of a
darkness that we will come to know better

TODD
What

RONNY
(suddenly wary of Todd)

Your moms on the phone

ANGLE on Todd

INT DUSSANDERS LIVING ROOM - DAY

TODD
Nowadays you have to soften it

DUSSANDER
Why do I care about this

TODD
Because I dont want it softened

Todd hops up and begins to pace the floor Dussander stares at
him blankly unsure of where this is going

DUSSANDER
I am sure you trouble your parents to no end
Actually

TODD
Im pretty low maintenance Thats

what my dad says

DUSSANDER

You told your parents about me then

TODD

You think Im crazy

DUSSANDER

I think youre crackers but go on Im

riveted

Todd looks deep into Dussanders eyes Dussander is
uncomfortable Slowly Todd reaches out and brushes his finger
against Dussanders hand Dussander gets up

DUSSANDER (CONTD)

What are you doing

Pause

TODD

And then it happened I was on my way to
the library It was raining

FLASHBACK INT CITY BUS - DAY

Todds voice narrates what we are seeing Todd seated near the

back of the bus

watches Dussander climb aboard Todd thinks

nothing of it at first but soon finds that he is unable to take

his eyes off him
his mind

Todd is trying to place the old mans face in

TODD (VO)

You climbed on the bus and started this slow
walk down the aisle Just like you were
examining a new batch of inmates I dont
think anybody gave you a second glance but
me but somehow people seemed to move out
of your way And under your arm you carried
a rolled up umbrella But what really did
it what really set me off was the coat You
were wearing this long black rain coat My
mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of
you taken at Patin You in your SS
greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm

INT DUSSANDERS LIVING ROOM - DAY

TODD

It was incredible
Dussander stares back at him flatly

DUSSANDER
All of this because of a rain coat

TODD
Well it wasnt that easy I mean I had to
really check up on it And every picture of
you in those books is forty years old at
least I went back to the library to find
the picture And then I matched it with the
photos I took

DUSSANDER
You took photographs of me

TODD
Yeah I got this little camera Fits right
in the palm of my hand

DUSSANDER
(crunches cigarette into ashtray)
Clever boy
TODD

But even then I couldnt be sure I needed
real proof So I went to the mall and bought
a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop anda
book that tells you what youre supposed to
look for and then dusted your mailbox while
you were at the movies Pretty smart huh

DUSSANDER
You put dust on my mailbox For
fingerprints You took photographs of me
What else did you do I dont believe any
of this

TODD
I already had a copy of your fingerprints
Theyre on your want sheet from the Israeli
government Its on database at UC Irvine
Can you believe that

DUSSANDER
Bourbon

He storms toward the kitchen and stops

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Would you care for a drink boy

TODD
Sure you got a Coke

DUSSANDER
No Kok
TODD
Milk

DUSSANDER
Milk

Dussander disappears into the kitchen Todd stands alone in the
living room

He lets out a long nervous breath showing for the first time
the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has
been putting up for Dussander He knows he has crossed into
dangerous territory from which there is no going back But
after a moment he composes himself he has come this far The
sternness returns to his eyes Todd is all business He takes
a breath and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear
him in the kitchen

TODD
It takes eight good matches theyre called
compares actually for a fingerprint to get
accepted in court

DUSSANDER (0S)
Is that right

FLASHBACK EXT DUSSANDERS FRONT PORCH - DAY

Todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly He pulls
the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the
mailbox for prints

TODD (VO)
Yeah there were two sets of prints The
first I figured were the mailmans Once I
knew what I was looking for yours were easy
to spot

INT DUSSANDERS LIVING ROOM - DAY

DUSSANDER (0S)
You should be a detective

The SOUNDS of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the
kitchen Drinks being poured Todd begins to move slowly
toward the kitchen
TODD
Maybe I will Mom thinks Id be good at it

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - DAY

He reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks
TODD
I found fourteen compares

Dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass
of bourbon He hands the tumbler to Todd who brings it up to
his lips and hesitates

TODD (CONTD)
You have some

DUSSANDER
Good Gott

He snatches the cup and swallows twice

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
You see Its milk boy From Dairylee
Farms On the carton is a picture of a
smiling cow

Todd pauses and then begins to drink

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
(more to himself than Todd)
And two missing children
(pause)
Boy what you have done I have to explain
this to you because clearly you dont
understand what you have done is a

violation

TODD
A violation

DUSSANDER
Yes

TODD

Kind of like those experiments with the
decompression chamber Now that was a
violation Dussander

DUSSANDER
That fucking name Enough of that I demand
it
TODD
You what
DUSSANDER
I demand --
TODD

You demand nothing from me Ever Get it

Pause
DUSSANDER
Boy I will tell you this once more and for
the last time My name is Arthur Denker It
has never been anything else It has never
even been Americanized If you must know
and apparently you must I was named by my
father who greatly admired the stories of
Arthur Conan Doyle I did serve in the
reserves I admit and in the late thirties
when I was first married I supported Hitler
I supported him most I suppose because for
the first time in years there was work and
there was tobacco Would you like a
cigarette

TODD
No My dad used to smoke Mom made him
quit Now hes addicted to Nicorette
thats nicotine gum

Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match
from a cabinet He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd

DUSSANDER
Nicotine gum

Dussanders eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives
neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him
He lingers a moment pulls deeply on the cigarette then turns
and continues

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Anyway Hitler lost his mind at the end
directing phantom armies at the whim of his
astrologer He even gave his dog Blondi a
death capsule On May 2nd 1945 my regiment
surrendered to the Americans I remember
that a private named Gonzales gave me a
chocolate bar I wept

Bored Todd sinks into a chair at the table

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
I was interned at Essen where I was treated
very well We listened to the Nuremberg
trials on the radio and when Goering
committed suicide I bought half a bottle of
schnaps and got drunk When I was released
I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works
until I retired in 1963 In 1967 I emigrated
here to California and became a US
Citizen I am as American as you are I
vote No Buenos Aires no Berlin no koo-ba
And thats it my whole story I hope youre
satisfied But if not its as you say
tough shit for you Now you go Enough of
this

Dussander points to the door but Todd remains motionless in his
chair

TODD
That was pretty good So much to remember
But I guess it helps when you have forty
years to practice your story

DUSSANDER
Oh to hell with this and to hell with you
Im calling the police Your father is
going to beat your behind when he picks you
up at the police station

TODD
No My parents dont believe in violence

DUSSANDER
Well they should start Im calling

Dussander steps past Todd and picks up the receiver of the phone
hanging on the wall above the table The boy still sits
motionless behind him Dussander dials a 9 and then with
more difficulty a 1 He stands with his finger poised over
the final 1 Tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead His
shoulders drop Todd stands up Their faces are close
together

TODD
Hang up the phone

DUSSANDER
This is unforgivable Do you know the things
youre accusing me of

TODD
Do it

Slowly Dussander brings the receiver down onto its hook

DUSSANDER
If you dont want money what do you want

TODD
I want to hear about it

DUSSANDER
Hear about what

TODD
The camps Everything The experiments The
examinations All the stuff the writers are
scared to put in their books because people
will think theyre sick Thats what I want
everything
Pause

DUSSANDER
Everything

TODD
Exactly And youre going to tell it to me

DUSSANDER
Youre a monster

TODD
According to history youre the monster

DUSSANDER
How could you ask me to remember such things
I can barely remember to take my heart
medicine

TODD
You were there You did those things No
one can tell it better than you can And you
will tell it starting today Right now If
you dont Ill tell everyone who you are I
swear it

DUSSANDER
Why should I Why should I do any of it

TODD
Because you hung up the phone Thats why
And just so you know just so there is no
misunderstanding whatsoever Everything I
have on you the compares the want sheet
all the photographs are all in an envelope
under my mattress Im going to put it there
every time I come to see you If anything
happens to me if I should suddenly
disappear some one will find it Believe
me --

DUSSANDER
Thats a foolish thing to do What if your
mother goes in your room anyway What if she
hires a maid

TODD
You better hope she doesnt
(looking at watch)
Were wasting time Lets get started I
have to be home for dinner Today I want to
hear about the ovens How you baked them
after they were dead and before

DUSSANDER
(to himself)
A boy a boy

TODD
But before we start put your teeth in You
look better with your teeth

EXT DUSSANDERS HOUSE - DUSK

It is later the same day Todd emerges from the house The
setting sun tells us he has been inside for several hours He
picks up his bike and hops on He stops He turns to look up
the street in both directions No one A moment later he
pedals off down the street

MAIN TITLES

INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

TITLE SEPTEMBER 1984

A typical high school image Rows of students sit listening to
a lecture from MR PROXMIRE fifties as he weaves his way
through the aisles

PROXMIRE
But in 1902 Panama didnt exist The
country we know as Panama was part of
Columbia

As the teacher continues to lecture the camera stops on JOEY
17 On his desk is a folded note He hands it across the aisle
and motions for it to be sent to Todd a few rows over The note
moves across the room avoiding the meandering teacher on its
way to Todd

PROXMIRE (CONTD)
Now the nations of the west knew they needed
a canal through Central America They were
tired of waiting for their ships to sail
around Cape Horn This was the new century
the age of modernization And the US was
at the forefront Teddy Roosevelt was in the
White House looking for any chance to assert
the might of America When Columbia balked
at the offer made by the US and England
Roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off
the coast of Panama just sit there where
they could be seen from the coast

The FEMALE STUDENT across the aisle from Todd now has the note
She whispers to him but he doesnt hear Todd is trying to say

awake with great difficulty

The girl extends the note just as Proxmire passes He stops
turns around plucks the note from the girls hand and heads for
the front of the class

PROXMIRE (CONTD)
Finally Columbia gave up the territory for
about a tenth of its original price And as
Roosevelt would say later The US stole
the Panama canal fair and square

Without glancing at it Proxmire crumples the note and drops it
into the waste basket by his desk

INT HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY

It is in between classes The denizens of STUDENTS crowd around
their lockers Among them is Todd He searches through his
locker and selects a book Suddenly the door SLAMS shut to
reveal the face of Joey standing against the lockers Todd
startled jumps back

JOEY
(laughs)
Take it easy Jesus Its just me flinch-
man
TODD
(serious)

Dont do that

JOEY
I got news for you Youre gonna like it

TODD
Walk with me to French

The two walk down the corridor

JOEY
Someone likes you Someone good

TODD

JOEY
Well I heard my sister talking on the phone
with Lisa Herman and well --

TODD

JOEY

(lowering voice)
You didnt hear it from me
TODD

JOEY

TODD

JOEY

TODD

JOEY

TODD
Grounded What for

JOEY
Where the hell you been Report cards were
sent out today I know that never affects
you

They arrive at the door of Todds classroom as the BELL SOUNDS

JOEY (CONTD)
Shit Dont forget what I told you

Joey runs off leaving Todd looking after him

EXT DUSSANDERS BACK PORCH - DAY
TITLE OCTOBER 1984

It is late afternoon Dussander sits in a rocking chair facing
out into the backyard Todd is in the lawn chair off to the
side He has just finished a McDonalds cheeseburger and is
about to start another one Dussander eats a Big Mac washing
it down with bourbon A large cat keeps jumping onto
Dussanders lap while he is eating He brushes it away annoyed

TODD
Ive never seen anyone drink bourbon with
McDonalds before So0 How did the stuff

get to Patin

DUSSANDER
In railroad cars marked Medical Supplies
It came in long crates that looked like coffins

TODD
Thats fitting Was it always Zyklon-B
The cat jumps into Dussanders lap again He throws it down
this time harder

DUSSANDER
No from time to time we would be sent
something else Experimental gases The
High Command was always interested in
improving efficiency Once they sent us a
gas code-named Pegasus A nerve gas
Thank God they never sent it again It

Todd sits up a little leaning in

TODD
It what

DUSSANDER
It didnt work very well It was quite boring

TODD
Bullshit Youre lying What did it do

DUSSANDER
It killed them What do you think it did
made them walk on water It killed them

The cat jumps up a third time This time Dussander picks it up
and tosses it a good six feet The animal hits the ground and runs
away

TODD
Tell me
(slurps on his Coke)
Tell me
DUSSANDER

I wont JI refuse Where are my cigarettes

He finds the pack and fumbles a cigarette to his lips He
lights it Todd watches calmly giving the old man a moment to
collect himself and then

TODD
What did it do

DUSSANDER
It made them dance

TODD
Dance

DUSSANDER
Like Zyklon-B it came in through the shower
heads After a few seconds the prisoners
began to leap about Some were screaming
Most of them were laughing They began to
vomit and to to defecate helplessly

TODD
You mean they they shit themselves
Woah

But Dussander ignores him staring out into the yard as he
begins to remember more easily

DUSSANDER
They began to twitch all over and make high
strange sounds in their throats At last
they collapsed and just lay there on the
concrete twitching and yodeling with blood
streaming from their noses But I lied to
you boy It didnt kill them Either
because it wasnt strong enough or because we
couldnt bring ourselves to wait that long
I suppose it was that I sent five men in
with rifles to end their agonies These were
five men I trusted It would have looked bad
on my record to have wasted so many
cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had
declared every cartridge a national resource
I was always given high marks for efficiency

TODD
Yeah I bet

Dussander looks down at the remains of the meal in his lap As
if his own story has suddenly disgusted him he balls the food
up in its wrapper and shoves it into the paper bag

DUSSANDER
How do you eat this crap everyday

TODD
Why didnt you just do the job yourself You
carried a gun didnt you

DUSSANDER
(incredulous)
I was the commandant of the camp

TODD
So you never killed anybody

DUSSANDER
(getting frustrated)
The entire world was at war boy People died

TODD
Thats not a real answer Im asking about
you

DUSSANDER

Boy I was a soldier in a position of power
You dont get to be there by selling girl
scouts cookies

TODD
I know what the SS was Dussander Who are
you talking to It was a bunch of dumb rich
kids who bought their way into the service so
they wouldnt have to go fight on the front

Dussander stares at Todd wanting to say something Todd
shovels a few more fries into his mouth then looks up and sees
Dussander eyeing him

DUSSANDER
Thats enough for today boy I beg you

Im tired

TODD
Yeah fine That was good story though You
always tell them good once I get you started

ANGLE on Dussander

DUSSANDERS DREAM 1 EXT OPEN FIELD - DAY

Dussander is asleep in his bed A low groaning sound comes in
very slowly Dussanders eyes open He sits up looks around
sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field It is
grassy but certainly not beautiful Something is wrong about
this place

He stands out of the bed wearing pajamas But it is cold He
takes the sheet and wraps himself in it The groaning is
getting louder more human We have never seen him frightened
until now He steps a few paces from the bed The groans have
becomes low screams There is no where to go Slowly as if he
knows what hes going to see he looks down at the ground Its
just grass But the human voices are now wailing desperately

His knees buckle but he tries to fight it He reaches his
knees and lowers his head toward the ground The white sheet
flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind The screams
are now at a feverish pitch His ear is inches from the grass
and his eyes marked with unmistakable terror are wide open
as

INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dussander bolts upright in his bed

EXT OUTDOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

RICHARD (DICK) BOWDEN 38 is a taller grayer version of his
son He stands over Todds shoulder watching him shoot at a
paper target He still has on a tie from work but the knot has
been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up Both Dick and
Todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses Dick chews
gum They are alone on the range

Todd fires a few rounds from his fathers 30-30 A strained
tension exists between the two Bowdens

DICK
Youre tight Dont hold your breath so long

TODD
Forget it I cant concentrate

He pulls off his headphones in disgust and hands the rifle to
his father Dick takes it and begins to reload it for him

DICK
I know your upset So am I So is your
mother

TODD
These honors classes they arent as easy

as I thought theyd be I totally admit it
I didnt prepare enough Im sorry

DICK
Well fine but now is not the time to slack
off You got a chance to finish at the top of
your class--

TODD
Nobody wants that more than I do Dad

DICK
Well you havent been hitting the books very
much

TODD

DICK

And seeing as youre not playing soccer this
year its not like you dont have enough
time--

TODD
That still bothers you doesnt it

DICK
(with difficulty)
No son If you werent enjoying it then

TODD
I think it bothers you and youre not telling
me
Dick decides to take a shot himself He readies himself and
fires

DICK

That was lousy Here

(gives the gun back to Todd)
I want to see your grades come up buddy
Thats all that bothers me And if you say
you need more time to study then thats what
well do The first thing is to cut out all
the time you spend reading to Mr Denker
Its a nice thing to do but its not helping
our school work a bit

Dick is looking at his son unsure if he has just seen a
contortion of rage on his sons face But Todd is cocking the
rifle and

DICK (CONTD)
Hey Todd You still with me

TODD
Yeah no Dad dont do that Please
Dont punish Mr Denker for something thats
my fault I mean hed be lost without me--

DICK
Hell be fine without you He was fine before
and hell be fine after Theres nothing
wrong with wanting to help people but you
gotta make sure you got yourself squared away
first Thats what matters

Todd turns to face his father and speaks to him with a new
seriousness

TODD
Dad am I like other kids

DICK
Not by a long shot

TODD
Then trust me on this Dont lose faith in
me because I blew a couple of exams I will

Freddy Tremains for extra help Hes a wiz
at trig But please Dad whatever you do

Pause

DICK
Did you practice that in front of a mirror or
something

Todd smiles Feeling his father caving in he aims the rifle and
squeezes off a round Dick keeps his eyes on Todd as he shoots

DICK (CONTD)
Hey hes not

TODD
(it takes him a second)
-No

DICK
Just checking
(thinks for a moment)

All right Well give your way a shot If
you think you can do it if you really do
and your serious then okay

You really like the old guy dont you

TODD
Im making a difference in somebodys life
Its that simple

Todd aims the rifle down range and pulls the trigger The gun
jams Todd tries to move the lever but it gets stuck

DICK
Okay okay
(takes the rifle)
Dont ever force it Watch

Dick begins to methodically unjam the gun

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - DUSK
TITLE NOVEMBER 1984

Dussander looks shabbier than in previous scenes His clothes
and hair reflect an increasing disregard for personal
appearance He goes to the basement door and leaning carefully
over the steps retrieves a fresh bottle from his stash stored
precariously on some shelves leading down to the basement He
comes back to the counter and cracks the bottle open Todds
irritated voice booms in from the living room

TODD (0S)
Dont get too drunk We still have a little
while

Dussander mumbles contemptuously and then speaks so Todd can
hear him

DUSSANDER
You dont have to do that you know
INT DUSSANDERS LIVING ROOM - DUSK

Todd has built a fire probably the first fire Dussanders
fireplace has seen in twenty years The room is bathed in a
warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside Todd uses the
poker to adjust one of the logs

TODD
Screw you Im doing this for me This
place is freezing

Dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy
chair which has been positioned in front of the hearth

DUSSANDER
Yes it must be fifty degrees outside Im
sure to you it seems positively frigid

TODD
Why didnt you pay your gas bill

DUSSANDER
It slipped my mind I will attend to it
tomorrow

TODD

Slipped your mind I noticed it didnt slip
your mind to stock up on a new case of
bourbon

DUSSANDER
Leave me alone

Todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet
away

TODD
All right so finish your story because Im
still not clear You cook up this stew and
you bring the prisoner in and you let them
smell it and suddenly they tell you
everything

DUSSANDER
Oh dont misunderstand me Certainly with a
pistol pressed to their head a prisoner
would tell us everything we wanted to know
sometimes more But mine was a much more
elegant method Remember it had been months
since they had smelled real potatoes
simmering over an open flame and boy when
that delicious odor hit their noses their
mouths would drop and out would pour an
account of every minor infraction their
friends had committed I mean it was
magnificent
TODD
And you let them eat the soup

DUSSANDER
Oh we never promised them the soup in
exchange for information We never mentioned

it at all
Pause Todd is impressed

TODD
Wow thats really good Dussander I mean
thats
(pointing)
thats thinking

Dussander does not respond He gazes deeply into the fire

DUSSANDER

But as the war pressed on the time for
such civilized measures became a luxury I
remember by April of 45 we had barely
enough food to feed ourselves The sound of
the Russian mortars grew louder everyday but
still the train cars from France and Poland
kept coming This was a time of desperation
The ovens burned day and night and still I
knew we would not beat the arrival of the
Russian forces Many of my men the cowardly
ones deserted during the night But the men
that remained the same ones I had called
upon so many times continued the work
At first we thought a massive fire in the
main building would serve our purpose We
could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch
up to each of the windows But with so many
of them we couldnt be sure the bodies would
burn properly We needed something

certain Then a young bright soldier I
shall never forget his enthusiastic smile
pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the
Western gate which had been used during
construction How perfectly simple it was
The bulldozers carved a narrow trench four
meters deep down the center of the camp
For two hours they dug until I realized we
may not have enough gas to finish the job
So the inmates were given shovels and told
they were building a shelter from the
incoming artillery When they were done I
immediately called for a practice drill and
three thousand naked bodies began to march
into the trench It took less than twenty
minutes to get them in place Quickly the
bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit
sending the piles of earth into the massive
grave Those who tried to free themselves
were shot of course but very few cartridges
were wasted that day The machines were too
fast Back and forth they went packing
the dirt One by one the tractors ran out of
gas and my men had to scurry along with
shovels But by sunset it was done I
gave the order to evacuate In the distance
the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like
an approaching thundercloud But I knew that
no matter what happened no one would ever
forget what we did here

Dussander stares into the fire Todd wide-eyed is locked on
Dussander when

The PHONE RINGS
They look at each other a bit puzzled Clearly it does not
ring very often and when it does Dussander cannot help but be

apprehensive

It rings again Dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen
Todd watches him go

DUSSANDER (CONTD)

Hello

(Pause Then with apprehension)
Yes No no trouble at all Yes
Yes hes here I see

(his face softens)
-Really No no plans Ah lovely
-My dear Id be delighted Certainly
-Of course I will Yes until then
-All right Good-bye

He hangs up and turns to Todd with a odd grin

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
It seems I am to be your guest for
Thanksgiving dinner

INT OLD TOYOTA CAR - ROADSIDE - NIGHT

Todd and Becky are in the backseat of Beckys car They are on
a date and have parked on the side of a road overlooking the
lights of their town At 16 BECKY TRASK is an attractive girl
who has recently discovered that boys like her and she likes
them They are kissing in the back seat MUSIC plays on the
stereo Beckys blouse is unbuttoned She stops kissing Todd

BECKY
Is everything all right

TODD
Yeah Im fine
Becky smiles to herself unconvinced

BECKY
Youre nervous I think its sweet

TODD
No No Im cool

BECKY
Do you want me to do something else

Todd just stares at her He doesnt know what he wants Becky
decides for him She slides down out of the frame Todd is
startled at first but lets her After a moment he closes his
eyes

EXT DUSSANDERS BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Dussander sits in his rocking chair A small blanket drapes
across his lap He smokes a cigarette and holds a near-empty
glass On the ground beside him there is a small bowl

DUSSANDER
Here kitty-kitty Here kitty-kitty

Out in the yard the large cat emerges from the darkness and
moves across the grass It sees Dussander and more
importantly the bowl next to him We see that the bowl is
filled with milk

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Come puss-puss Thats right Ill wait

Dussander sits perfectly still Cautiously the cat moves
toward the porch

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Thats right puss-puss You can smell it
now cant you

The cat creeps to the edge of the steps It takes them one at a
time

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Thats right kitty-kitty Thats right

After a moment the cat edges up to the bowl Its tail twitches
nervously Finally it begins to lick up the milk Dussander
crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass His movements
are slow and patient From under the blanket he pulls a pair of
yellow rubber gloves He begins to put them on The cat jumps
back for a moment Dussander freezes He waits the cat out
Soon the animal is back at the bowl Dussander continues with
the gloves He watches the cats tail As the animal gets
comfortable its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair
Dussander slams the chair back The CAT SHRIEKS Dussander
flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight
squirming HISSING bundle He stands out of the chair

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Gotcha

INT BECKYS TOYOTA - ROADSIDE - NIGHT

It is later Becky sits behind the wheel Todd is next to her
A different song is on the RADIO They sit for a moment in
silence clearly uncomfortable

TODD
Im sorry

BECKY
Its all right Maybe youll be more in the
mood later

TODD
I dont know Thats never happened before

Becky lights a joint She takes a puff and exhales toward Todd

TODD (CONTD)
Can you blow that the other way

BECKY
Maybe you dont like me

TODD
No I do

BECKY
(exhaling out the window)
Maybe you dont like girls

For a moment it is as though Todds face were purple with rage
But a moment later the expression is gone Todd turns away

Becky sees that her comment has hurt him

BECKY (CONTD)
That was a lousy thing for me to say Im
sorry honey
She kisses him on the cheek He nods reluctantly
TODD

Lets just go home

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dussander bursts through the door with the bundle A single paw
emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at Dussander
clawing him across the neck

DUSSANDER
Oww you mother-fucker

They move across the room to the stove With difficulty
Dussander pulls open the oven door revealing the glowing red
interior The animal SCREAMS and claws at Dussanders neck and
arms escaping more and more from the blanket with every
gyration of its body With a mighty shove Dussander plunges the
cat toward the opening but the animal braces its paws on the
edge of the stove The two are deadlocked But Dussanders
hands are too close to the heat He screams His grip loosens
just enough With a desperate cry the animal charges up
Dussanders body over his head and leaps to the floor
Dussander dives after it

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Come here

But the animal is too swift In a second it is atop the
counter and out the open window above the sink Although
defeated and exhausted Dussander cannot contain his excitement
His panting gives way to a twisted hearty laugh

TODDS DAYDREAM INT EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

This is a 1940s laboratory Todd is in his boxer shorts
Dussander is next to him wearing a lab coat and his SS
officers hat Todd looks down on the examination table A
YOUNG GIRL about 16 is held to the table with clamps She is
naked staring at Todd Behind the table is a glass window and
behind that is another room where OTHER SCIENTISTS are
monitoring equipment

Over Dussanders methodical voice Todds dream shows flashes of
what is being done some sort of sexual experiment on the girl

DUSSANDER
(to other scientists)
Test run eight-four Electricity sexual
stimulus metabolism Based on the Thyssen
theories of negative reinforcement

Dreamlike SOUNDS and images pass before us Todds breathing
the girls cry electrical equipment naked flesh maybe
Todds maybe the girls

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Subject is a young Jewish girl approximately
sixteen years of age no scars no
identifying marks no known disabilities --

Inside the control room a SCIENTIST monitors a volt meter
calling out the readings as Dussander yells for the voltage to
be increased As the meter rises the girl SCREAMS more
violently Perhaps her eyes roll back her tongue flutters in
her mouth Through all of this the scientists call out and the
record heart rate blood pressure brain activity voltage etc
Todds eyes close His breathing accelerates as does the motion
of his hips until

INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Todd snaps out of his daydream His trigonometry class is
having an examination He sits at his desk staring blankly at
the paper before him Most of the answer spaces are empty He
knows he is going to fail another test

EXT OUTOOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

Todd is blasting away rapid-firing the rifle down range at an
unfortunate paper target The protective headphones lay on the
counter beside him as does his backpack He stops shooting
when a voice snaps over the PA speaker next to him

VOICE (0S)
You on lane twelve You need to have your
headgear on at all times (click) And no
rapid firing

Todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small
booth Todd puts on the headgear and after a moment the man
goes back to reading a newspaper Todd looks up and down the
range One or two other shooters are concentrating on their
targets Todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the
man in the booth He snaps off a single dry round Todd smiles
weakly at the sound of the click Unnoticed by anyone he turns
back toward the target strangely comforted

INT DINING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY

Thanksgiving dinner All the Bowdens are there including
Dicks parents VICTOR and AGNES Dussander sits at the head of
the table Todd next to him The family has finished dinner and
is having coffee Dick and his father smoke cigars Todds
mother MONICA BOWDEN still pretty at 36 pours Dussander some
more coffee

MONICA
Todd loved that dog A lot more than Dick
did

DICK

heart
DUSSANDER
Excuse me Mrs Bowden Put it down Ive

Dussander still looks puzzled He looks to Todd but Victor
jumps in

VICTOR (CONTD)
Well its how they kill it Arthur They do

MONICA

DUSSANDER
I see

Todd shoots him a fiery glare that the others dont notice

MONICA
Some more pie

DUSSANDER
As my departed wife used to say One must
never overdo the sublime

AGNES
It was delicious Monica

VICTOR
Tell me Arthur if you dont mind me asking
What did you do during the war

AGNES
Now dont get too personal Victor

A quick moment between Todd and Dussander

DUSSANDER

I was a student at the University until my
reserve unit was called in 1943

(notices Victor)
But we were not a combat unit thank God
Mechanical engineers Help me find my
cigarettes Todd Would you In those days
not even the call of higher learning could
exempt an able body from military service

Dussanders cigarettes are right in front of him Todd fetches
one and bringing it to his own lips lights it for him
MONICA
Todd Bowden

DUSSANDER
(laughs knowingly)
My dear I do apologize My hands are too
arthritic to strike a match Im afraid
Your son has been good enough to help an old
man with his filthy habits

MONICA
Wellas long as you dont inhale

TODD
Cigarettes are gross Mom

VICTOR
Well Victor you were doing your part like
we all were I suppose Of course if you
were in the Pacific Fleet Id have to shoot
you

Everyone laughs except Todd

DICK
(to Dussander)
My dad is very proud of the fact that the
Bowden men have hit every major conflict
since the Civil War

VICTOR
Thats right Dickie served two tours in
Vietnam Earned a bronze star and a purple
heart

DICK
Its one family tradition Id like to put an
end to Todd and I blow a few caps down at
the range every week Thats all the combat
he needs

TODD
(perking up offended)
Whats that supposed to mean

DICK
Forget it

DUSSANDER
(looking at Todd)
Perhaps your son would excel in combat

MONICA
Todd could excel at anything Right honey

Todd doesnt answer His eyes are still on Dick Dick notices
him
AGNES
(getting up starts to clear some
dishes)
Oh lets dont even talk about this I cant
stand to think of you boys fighting another
war

DUSSANDER
The Purple Heart You were injured

TODD
He was knocked unconscious and woke up ina
hospital

A long pause Dick is embarrassed and offended by Todds stab
He puffs on his cigar Agnes comes in from the kitchen and picks
up some more dishes Dick stands suddenly to help her

DICK
Mom let me get that for you

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Todd and Dussander walk together in silence Todd is clearly in
a bad mood Dussander prods him

DUSSANDER
You shouldnt be so hard on your father

TODD
Why dont you mind your own business

DUSSANDER
(amused at Todds short fuse)
Boy Its not so easy to raise children Your
father does the best he can Im sure Having
his own father there is bound to cause some
anxiety on his part--

TODD
Oh give me a frigging break will you Look
whos talking to me for Christs sake And
what was that crap about the dog If you
were any more charming I was going to puke

DUSSANDER
Heavens boy wasnt that precisely the
point I used the evening to our advantage

TODD
Our advantage Our advantage

DUSSANDER
Certainly now they will offer no objections
if you continue to come over and read to me
TODD
You sure take a lot for granted Do you
think theres anybody forcing me to come over
to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up
booze all day Do you

DUSSANDER
Lower your voice People will hear

TODD
So what

Dussander stops

DUSSANDER
No nobody forces you to come In fact you
are welcome to stay away Believe me boy I
have no scruples about drinking alone None
at all

They start walking again Dussander turns up his driveway
Todd follows

TODD
You know if they found out what you are
theyd spit on you

DUSSANDER
I am sure they would have nothing but
revulsion for me But what would they say
about you boy when I told them you had
known about me for nine months and said
nothing

Dussander unlocks his door and steps in

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Come and see me if you please and stay home
if you dont Good night boy

He closes the door

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - DAY
TITLE DECEMBER 1984

Todd places a brightly wrapped Christmas present on the table in
front of Dussander who looks at it skeptically

TODD
Go ahead open it Wait I better pull down
the shades first

DUSSANDER
What for
TODD
Just to be safe

DUSSANDER
(getting up)
To hell with this You open it

TODD
Oh relax old man Sit down and open it

Todd opens the refrigerator and pulls out a can of Coke
Dussander slowly sits back down

DUSSANDER
You wrapped it yourself I see

He begins to remove the bow and then the paper He moves very
cautiously as if the package might explode at any moment

Finally he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one
of fear to one of exasperation

TODD
Merry Christmas

We see that the box contains a replica of an officers SS
uniform complete with hat and jackboots Dussander reads the
label

DUSSANDER
Petes Quality Costume Clothiers - Serving
You Since 1976

TODD
Go ahead try it on

DUSSANDER
Are you out of your mind boy What makes
you think I would put something like that on

my freedom whats left of it anyway I do

Dussander bangs the table

DUSSANDER
I should smash you

TODD

Eichmann You forget that I think And

way You will put this on because I want to
see you in it Now strip

DUSSANDER
I hope you go to hell --

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - DAY

It is five minutes later Dussander stands in the uniform

looks at it indignantly

DUSSANDER
The insignia is all wrong The boots should
be leather not imitation

TODD
That suit cost me over eighty bucks with
the boots

DUSSANDER
And this material what Polyester

TODD

He
Quiet Straighten that hat
Dussander ignores him

TODD (CONTD)
Straighten that hat soldier

DUSSANDER
Good Gott

Dussander does what he is told

TODD
Actung

Slowly Dussander straightens up

TODD (CONTD)
Now march Do it

Dussander begins to move his feet in place

TODD (CONTD)
Thats it March

Dussander has gotten into a rhythm marching faster in place

TODD (CONTD)
About face

Dussander spins sharply on his heels He continues to march

TODD (CONTD)
About face

Dussander is stomping in place vigorously He spins on command
facing Todd He gives a Nazi salute Todd watches him march

for a moment At first he enjoys the domination but as

Dussander gets caught up in the marching Todds expression changes

TODD (CONTD)
Okay thats enough

Dussander is still marching furiously

TODD (CONTD)
I said thats enough

Suddenly Dussander stops He collapses into a chair exhausted
He sits there panting for a moment

DUSSANDER
Boy be careful You play with fire

DUSSANDERS DREAM 2 INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dussander wakes to a strange faint rumble He climbs out of
bed and walks across his bedroom toward the source of the sound
We follow him as he moves farther and farther away from his bed
Soon it is apparent that he is in a space much larger than his
room Yet he is still in darkness as if his room has suddenly
ended and continues into a black void

But the rumble gets louder more mechanical sounding As the
sound crescendoes we see what Dussander sees A train car
Steam rises in the air as if the train has just come to a
complete stop in the night

Dussander stares at the boxcar coldly and we realize that
something is staring back at him Eyes dozens of them glare
back at him from between the slatted boards of the train Some
are low to the flooe like those of children Others are
higher Dussander snaps at them in German

DUSSANDER
(in German)
Come out Come out now

No one exits the train Yet the eyes seem to move around
cautiously within the boxcar Dussander is getting angry His
orders arent being carried out Suddenly the door of the train
slides open But still only the eyes are visible

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
(in German)
Line up in front of the train Now

Again no one gets off Enraged Dussander takes a few steps
toward the train In a flash the eyes charge at him But these
are not the eyes of prisoners These are wolves Dussander can
only cover his face with his arms as the snarling teeth descend
upon him

INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dussander wakes from his nightmare in a cold sweat His pajamas
are soaked Disoriented and out of breath he climbs out of bed
and clicks on the light

The closet He stares at the closed closet door for a moment and
then moves toward it slowly He opens the door and runs his
fingers across the assortment of shirts and jackets His hand
stops near the back

INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER

Dussander is seated on the side of the bed smoking a cigarette
He is dressed with the exception of the boots and hat in the
SS uniform He appears calmer less agitated He crunches out
the cigarette and slips under the covers He turns off the
light He closes his eyes For the moment he is at peace
INT HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY

Todd stands facing his open locker He is staring at his report
card Sweat collects on his forehead He looks like he is
about to explode He wipes his brow with his sleeve and turns
around to see if anyone notices him TWO STUDENTS catch his
eye They are both Asian They are smiling and pouring over
each others report cards Todd zips open his backpack giving
us a quick glimpse of the disassembled rifle pieces inside He
throws the report card in and zips up the bag Slinging the bag
over his shoulder he slams the locker shut and heads off down
the hall

INT HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

Todd is shooting baskets with Joey It is after school Todd
wears a white T-shirt Off to the side we see the dress shirt
he was wearing earlier and his school bag

JOEY
So what are you going to do

TODD
Fuck if I know

Todd throws up a clumsy shot It misses

JOEY
Youre throwing it flat Let it roll off
your fingers more

TODD
(snapping at him)
I dont need a lesson

Todd adjusts his grip on the ball anyway He shoots again No
good

JOEY
Your dad man I dont know I mean Ima
fuck up My dad is used to this crap from
me

Todd does not respond to his friends attempt at humor He is
slamming the ball around with great force He bounces it hard
off the back wall to give himself a rebound He is mumbling to
himself

JOEY
What

TODD
What
JOEY
You said something

TODD
No

JOEY
Youre talking to yourself Bowden Its not
the first time Ive noticed it What is
going on with you

TODD
Nothing Joey I fucked up III fix it
III fix it

JOEY
(hurt)
All right man Whatever you say Look I

No response from Todd

JOEY (CONTD)
If you need to talk you can call me You
know that III see you around

Joey walks off Todd continues shooting the ball

TODD
(mumbling)
Youre talking to yourself Bowden Youre
talking to yourself Bowden

He throws up a shot It is good

TODD (CONTD)
III fix it III fix it

A strange SQUAWKING sound is heard Todd doesnt hear it at
first but as the sound grows louder Todd stops the ball and
looks around His eyes focus on the area near an open doorway
Sunlight streams into the empty gym Todd walks closer seeing
that the sound is coming from an injured bird that has crawled
in from outside He goes up to it The bird is black Its
wing is damaged It SQUAWKS loudly looking up at Todd Todd
begins mumbling again He starts to dribble the ball
thoughtlessly As his words become clearer the bouncing gets
harder

TODD (CONTD)
Ill fix it Ill fix it Ill fix it

Todd is bouncing the ball very hard next to him The bird
continues to SCREAM Slowly the ball drifts from beside Todd to
in front of him gaining force with every bounce He brings it
up to his face and with both hands throws it down with all his
might When it comes back up it is smeared with blood He
throws it down again this time it comes up with feathers
smeared in the blood The squawking has stopped Blood
splatters on Todds shirt His eyes close

He stops the ball looks around No one has seen him He
notices his shirt Calmly he tears it off wraps the ball in
it and tosses it in a nearby trash can

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Todd pedals his bike through town carrying a brown paper bag
under one arm He turns down Dussanders street He stops in
front of the house and heads for the front door

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - DAY

Dussander emerges from the basement just as Todd comes into the
kitchen Todd sniffs the air frowns

TODD
What the fuck happened in here

DUSSANDER
Ah boy I burned my TV dinner Im afraid

TODD
Somethings come up Sit down

Dussanders studies Todd for a moment Although Todd appears
calm his tone reflects a somber business-like attitude

DUSSANDER
I see
(sits at table)
What seems to be the trouble

Todd sets his grade card and the envelope on the table
Dussander picks up the grade card and examines it

DUSSANDER
Quarterly Progress Report
(he reads silently)
You seem to have fallen on the rocks my boy
One B three Cs and a D Hardly the work of
a National Merit Scholar or whatever you
call yourself

TODD
This isnt a joke Dussander I cant blame

this on teachers or honors classes anymore

DUSSANDER
Looks like you have a problem then

TODD
I have a problem You still dont get it
Im out of excuses Do you know whats going
to happen when my dad sees that Hes going
to hit the fucking roof Hell get it all
out of me The truth youeverything

DUSSANDER
Boy its not my fault your grades have
fallen

TODD

Dont be so sure
Dussander throws Todd a dismissive wave He gets up to get a drink

DUSSANDER
Please you dont spend that much time here
I hardly think--

TODD
(quickly as if confessing something)
I cant study anymore

Pause Dussander looks at him oddly a bit surprised But then
opens the cabinet and pulls out a glass allowing Todd to continue

TODD
(with difficulty)
I try But its different now I sit in

front of my books and start thinking about
about corpses and electrified fences and
people getting strangled with piano wire

All that crap you tell me The next thing I
know its after midnight I sit in class
like a zombie useless But thats not
the half of it Check out the letter

Dussander goes back to the table and picks up the envelope He
opens it

DUSSANDER

(reading letter)
Dear Mr and Mrs Bowden this note is to
suggest that we have a group conference
concerning Todds first semester grades In
light of his previous good work in this
school the sudden deterioration in his
grades suggest a specific problem which
should be addressed before his academic
advancement is jeopardized permanently Such
a problem can often be solved by a frank and
open discussion I am ready to work out a
time for us to meet In a case such as this
earlier is usually better Sincerely yours
Edward French Who is this Edward French
the headmaster
TODD
French Fuck no Hes a stupid guidance
counselor

DUSSANDER
Guidance counselor What is that

TODD
He guides and he counsels You read the
fucking note Do you realize I could have to
go to summer school Me in there with all
those fuck-ups I do not want to go to
summer school

DUSSANDER
Or to the reformatory

TODD
What did you say

DUSSANDER
Boy you have a far greater problem than
your school grades Before you speak to me
about what they will get out of you
remember the facts Seventy thousand
people died at Patin Have you forgotten
that To the world at large I am the most
despicable of criminals a monster Do you
think I would stand aside and let you turn me
in so easily Without a fight Is your
American self-confidence so bloated that you
have never once realized you are an accessory
to my crimes You have criminal knowledge of
an illegal alien and have not reported it
Dont you see that And if Im caught I
will tell the world all about you When the
reporters put their microphones in my face it
will be your name Ill repeat over and over
again Todd Bowden yes thats his name
How long oh for months almost a year
He wanted to know everything Thats how
he put it yes - everything

TODD
Theyd never believe you

DUSSANDER
Perhaps perhaps not Its a gamble How
would you explain all those books you were
reading to me My eyes are not what they
were but I can still read fine print I can
prove it

TODD
So what Id say you tricked me

DUSSANDER
Why would I do that

TODD
For friendship because youre lonely and had
no one in your life No jury would take your
word over mine A Nazi Forget it Just
get it out of your head You cant threaten
me and you cant scare me What you can do
is find me a pencil

DUSSANDER
A pencil what for

Todd sets the small paper bag on the table Dussander opens it
and removes a small bottle The label reads ink eradicator
He also removes an x-acto knife and a few sheets of rub-off
letters

TODD
That will take care of the report card I
think About that fucking letter I dont
know

Todd sits down at the table He takes the bottle from Dussander
and examines the report card

TODD (CONTD)
Fuck come on a pencil A sharp one
With an eraser

Dussander pauses He knows Todd is right Slowly he goes to
the counter and opens a drawer He rummages through it as Todd
sits with his back to him Dussander picks out a pencil with an
extremely sharp point He holds it point out and approaches
Todd He gets closer the point moves in toward the back of
Todds head He holds the point inches from the boys neck He
deliberates

DUSSANDER
Will this do

Todd grabs the pencil Dussander turns toward the window He
thinks for a moment

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Tell me does this French know your parents
in a social way

TODD
Him Fuck no They wouldnt mix with a
geek like him

DUSSANDER
How about professionally Has he ever called
them before

TODD
No Ive never needed it Why

DUSSANDER
I have an idea It will require you to make
one phone call

INT HIGH SCHOOL - OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY

Kurt Dussander aka Arthur Denker aka Victor Bowden
Todds grandfather sits outside an office marked Edward
French - Guidance Dussander looks the best he has ever
looked His hair is clean and combed His face is shaved And
he is smartly dressed in his best blue suit As he waits he
glances down at a piece of paper We see that it is a crib-
sheet of Todds family tree Several names appear on the
sheet connected to other names by lines and arrows By each
name is one or two word description such as dead cancer
1981 or divorced Dallas Tex The door opens up Dussander
pockets the note EDWARD FRENCH 40s stands in the doorway
He wears a turtle neck under his sportcoat

FRENCH
Mr Bowden

DUSSANDER
Mr French a pleasure

There is a bit of hesitation on Frenchs part but they shake
hands Dussander notices the shoes on Frenchs feet bright red
converse high-tops

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
My those are some colorful shoes

INT HIGH SCHOOL - FRENCHS OFFICE - DAY

French makes his way around his desk Dussander stands by the
door

FRENCH
To you sir Im sure they seem quite out of
the ordinary But when it is your job to get
confused sixteen year-olds to open up to you
you take whatever steps you need Please
have a seat

They both sit

DUSSANDER
And the shoes work

FRENCH
They seem to help believe it or not Well
I thank you for coming down Mr Bowden but
Ill be frank with you
DUSSANDER
Yes please do

FRENCH
The fact that youre here and not Todds
parents tells me a great deal

DUSSANDER
Im sure My son and his wife asked me to
come in and discuss this sorry business with
you Mr French Todd is a good boy believe
me This trouble with his grades is only
temporary

Dussander pulls out his cigarettes and then thinking twice
puts them back

FRENCH
Its all right
(pulls an ashtray from desk
drawer)
Theres no smoking on school grounds but if
it will make you more comfortable Ill never
tell

DUSSANDER
A terrible habit but thank you
(lights up)
I suppose I should begin by informing you
that my son and my daughter-in-law are having
troubles at home Rather bad troubles I
should think

FRENCH
I appreciate your candor

DUSSANDER
(leaning in)
The mother drinks

FRENCH
Oh

DUSSANDER
Yes The boy has told me that he has come
home on two occasions and has found her
sprawled out on the kitchen table He knows
how my son feels about her drinking and so on
these occasions he has put dinner in the oven
himself and forced enough black coffee down
his mothers throat so that she will at least
be awake when Richard gets home

FRENCH
Thats bad Has Mrs Bowden thought about
getting professional help for her problem
DUSSANDER
The boy has tried to persuade her but she is
far too ashamed I think If she was given a

little time You understand
FRENCH

Of course Your son Todds father
DUSSANDER

He is not without blame believe me The
hours he works The meals he has missed
They take a toll on a family I was raised
to believe that a mans family came before
his work or anything else I tried to teach

my son that but --

FRENCH
Theres only so much we can teach our kids
Mr Bowden What about Monicas mother or

father Couldnt they talk to her

DUSSANDER
Her mother Sabrina lives in a nursing home
in Florida Im afraid after her husband
died she lost her will to live

FRENCH
Probably not the best person for Monica to
speak to

DUSSANDER
Indeed

FRENCH

Mr Bowden I dont have to remind you Im
sure of Todds stellar academic record
National Merit Scholar finalist Academic
All-Stars

DUSSANDER
Yes I keep his certificates on the wall of
my store I run a small bookstore in San
Remo

A hint of skepticism crosses Frenchs eyes

FRENCH

(glancing at folder on desk)
Yes I see that Anyway Todd is and I hate
to phrase it this way but hes one of the
ones worth fighting for Hes a special kid
we both know that But If Todds grades
dont improve drastically and quickly
hell be opening a real nasty can of worms
Summer school would just be the beginning
His whole college acceptance schedule would
be thrown way off course The good schools
wont know what to make of him Im sure
hed hate that and so would you

DUSSANDER
Of course

FRENCH
So lets get to the bottom line shall we
What Im proposing is some family counselling
at the Counselling Center downtown
Everything is in confidence of course A
man in charge down there Harry Shumacher is
a good friend of mine I think Todd and his
parents should go see him together It might
be difficult for Todd to go to his parents
with this I think you should do it Maybe
we can get everybody on track by the end of
the next quarter It will be tough but not
impossible

DUSSANDER
Im not sure that would be the best thing for
the boy The parents might resent him if I
took them that proposal right now Things
are very delicate To swing the scale too
far in the wrong direction might cause more
harm than good The boy has promised to work
harder in his studies He is most concerned
by the drop in his grades more alarmed than
you might expect He has his mind set on
attending Stanford or Berkeley next fall and
does not wish to see his plans altered

FRENCH
Yes well --

DUSSANDER
Also the parents would resent me Monica
already thinks I meddle too much in her
affairs

FRENCH
I have a great deal of experience in these
matters Mr Bowden And please understand
that my interest in your sons marital
problems begins and ends with the effect they
are having on Todd And right now I think
they are having quite an effect I really
think counselling is in order here

DUSSANDER
Allow me to make a counter proposal You
have I believe a system for warning parents
of poor grades

FRENCH
Yes Interpretation of Progress cards IOP
cards The kids call them flunk card They
only get them when their grades in a class
fall below the seventy percent That means a
D or an F Why

DUSSANDER
And they are sent out when

FRENCH
Mid-quarter Thats about three weeks into
the new marking period

DUSSANDER
Allowing for Christmas break the next time
they are sent out will be in late January
correct

FRENCH
Yes thats right

DUSSANDER
Good Then what I suggest is this

EXT DUSSANDERS BACK PORCH - DAY

Dussander still wears the blue suit The tie has been loosened
and top button undone Todd still wears his backpack

TODD
You what

DUSSANDER
I told him you were getting back on track by
your own accord I gave him my word If you
get even one flunk card--

TODD
Are you out of your fucking mind Im going
to get three or four flunk cards I failed
an economics test today so theres another
one

DUSSANDER
Boy it was the best I could do without
arousing suspicion

TODD
I could have done better myself --

DUSSANDER
Well you didnt did you This is the way it
is and now you are upset because the only way
you can make things right is to work

TODD
Youre insane Im upset because it cant be done

DUSSANDER
It can And it will You will work

TODD
I dont take orders from you Maybe youve
forgotten --

DUSSANDER

(turning on him)
Listen boy Before today it was possible
just barely possible that you could have
denounced me and come out clean yourself
The way your nerves have been lately I dont
think so but never mind that It was - at
least technically possible But now things
have changed Today I impersonated your
grandfather one Victor Bowden And it was
you who arranged the meeting What would
people make of that If things come out
now perhaps you were right your age and a
good attorney might keep you out of jail but
you would be humiliated boy publicly You
would be infamous Your parents too Do you
know what such a scandal would do to them
To you Think about that

Todd is stunned He turns away then back again struggling for
the right words

TODD
You fucker

DUSSANDER
Its a done deal boy If you dont like it
you can discuss it at family counselling

TODD
God I wish I wish --
DUSSANDER
Never mind your wishes Your wishes make me

sick All I want to hear is that you
understand the situation

Todd is furious He sees there is no other way but continues
fighting

TODD
Look you gotta believe me There is no way
in hell that I can pull myself out of a half
year slide in a couple of weeks I wish I
could but were just going to have to think
of something else

DUSSANDER
Boy the time for discussion is over This
is the way it is You are going to work
And I am going to be right here with you

TODD
What are you talking about

EXT BIKE PATH - DAY

Todd is standing with his bike on a dirt path He is looking
out at something The wind blows throw his hair A distant
glimpse of some buildings off to the side tell us he is on a
hill

DUSSANDER (VO)
You are going to spend the rest of this
quarter all of your vacation and the first
three weeks of January studying During your
free period you will study During lunch
you will study And after school and on
weekends you will come here and do the same

EXT BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DAY

Todd pedals his bike furiously toward the camera He approaches
a tunnel lined with corrugated metal below an overpass

TODD (VO)
Not here at home

DUSSANDER (VO)
No At home you will dawdle you will talk
on the telephone watch TV Here I can make
sure that nothing distracts you from your
studies

Todd emerges from the tunnel

DUSSANDERS DREAM 3 EXT PRISON YARD - NIGHT

Spotlights like those from a guard tower criss cross over a
small compound surrounded by an electrified fence Inside the
pen wolf-like dogs snarl and gnash their teeth The spotlight
catches the source of their aggravation

Dussander caught ghoulishly in the roving light stands in
uniform outside the pen He is laughing In his hand is his
Luger He fires through the fence killing one of the dogs
They go wild He laughs harder He shoots again and then
again It is like shooting fish in a barrel

The light beam passes the pen to reveal that the dogs have
transformed into human prisoners They maneuver helplessly to
avoid Dussanders bullets But he fires faster his laugh
growing more extreme His movements in between shots becomes a
sort of dance One prisoner flies against the fence in a pools
of sparks As Dussanders waltz reaches its climax one
prisoner remains in the pen He looks up It is Todd Angle
on Dussanders toothy grin The gun comes up

INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT - IMMEDIATELY AFTER

Dussander wakes up A CLANKING SOUND echoes from the street
Dussander looks like he could have been having a wonderful sex
dream but he turns his head toward the direction of the street
He clicks on the light Dressed in the SS uniform he gets up
and moves toward the window

Through the window bathed in the glow of a street lamp a
derelict who we will come to know as ARCHIE rummages through
Dussanders trashcans Under his arm are a few of the empty
bourbon bottles

INT BECKYS TOYOTA - NIGHT

The car pulls into the driveway of Todds house Becky is
smoking a joint and blowing the smoke out the window They both
look a little tipsy as if they have been to a party She holds
the joint up to Todd He contemplates then takes it Todds
first toke of marijuana isnt very small Becky looks on
surprised She reaches out for the joint and Todd waves her
off He pulls again this time ingesting a huge hit He holds
it then exhales He gives the roach back to Becky

TODD
Their light is still on Ill get out on
your side Dont say anything

Becky gets out Todd slides over and does the same She
crushes the joint out on the pavement and puts the rest in her
purse

INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dussander watches Archie collect the cans and bottles There is
something about Archie that makes Dussander wonder if he has
seen him before Archie looks up right into Dussanders
window as if he were expecting him to be there The two stare
at one another for a long moment Suddenly Dussander is aware
that he is dressed in the SS uniform

He quickly steps back from the window His breathing is short
and erratic as he waits in the shadows for Archie to finish
After a long moment the noise from the street stops We hear
only the faint steps of Archie walking away

INT TODDS BEDROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Todd and Beckys lips are locked in a passionate kiss In their
exuberance they fall onto the bed As they try to undress and
kiss at the same time Becky begins to moan Todd brings his
fingers to his lips

TODD
Shhh

Their clothes tumble off around them

TODD (CONTD)
Dont move

He slides off her and opens the drawer by his bed He pulls out
a condom By now she is naked Todd slips out of his underwear
and falls on top of her The RADIO plays in the bg as Todd
begins to grind away with his hips She moans softly with
delight

The CAMERA MOVES off of them to reveal a man in a lab coat
setting up a volt meter This is one of the scientists from
Todds laboratory nightmare The CAMERA continues TO PAN across
the bedroom showing the other scientists preparing for the
electricity experiment The CAMERA STOPS on Dussander
clipboard in hand observing everything carefully

Todd releases with a final thrust Becky is MOANING in a series
of high fast yelps Todd lies still on her body Becky is
speechless still quivering from the unusually intense love
making

INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The bedroom is dark except for the glowing tip of a cigarette
Dussander is in bed wide awake

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - DAY

TITLE JANUARY 1985

Todd sits alone at the table eating while he studies
Dussander crosses the frame behind him drink in hand Todd is
noticeably annoyed by Dussanders presence

EXT BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DUSK

It is raining Todd is riding fast He wears a raincoat with
the hood up He talks to himself loudly but we cant make out

what he is saying He enters the tunnel

The muddy run-off inside the tunnel catches Todd by surprise
He loses control of the bike and falls into the mud
TODD
Fuck

Todd gets up and tries to free his bike but the mud and water
do not make the job easy He is almost finished when a gruff
voice catches his attention

ARCHIE (0S)
Hey kid you having some trouble

Todd looks up and sees a figure moving toward him in the shadows
of the tunnel Todd quickly pulls out a pocket knife He flicks
open the blade and hides it behind his leg

TODD
No I got it thanks

The figure steps closer The light catches his face to reveal
Archie He is an unshaven filthy mess and when he speaks his
words are slurred from years of steady drinking

ARCHIE
That case maybe you could loan me a dollar
Help out a Vietnam vet How ‘bout it

Todd eyes the man cautiously He looks around No one is
nearby The constant din of the rain echoes within the confines

of the tunnel

TODD
I I dont know I dont think so

Todd palms the knife out of sight and slowly approaches the bum

ARCHIE
Cmon you got something for me I know you
do

TODD
Well maybe I have to check

Todds hands go into his pockets He stops a few feet from the
bum

ARCHIE

See I got to get up to LA Got a job
waiting for me up there

Todd moves closer Close enough to touch the bum

TODD
I thought I did have a couple of quarters

The bum looks at him hopefully Todd looks back at him sizing
him up really noticing him for the first time

ARCHIE
You know

(his voice drops)
For a dollar Ill give you a blow job Take
you right up there where its still dry You
never had so good kid Youll come your
brains out

Todd freezes for a moment The bum is right in his face
Suddenly Todd throws a handful of change at the bum and sprints
back to his bike He hops on and is gone in a flash leaving
the bum there to pick up the scattered coins

As Todd zips away the hood is off his head The rain begins to
beat away the splattered mud from his face

INT HIGH SCHOOL - HISTORY CLASS - DAY

Mr Proxmire makes his way through the rows of desks He is
passing out papers

PROXMIRE
Our illustrious administration in its quest
to make my job as difficult as possible has
decided that home room teachers are now
responsible for handing IOP cards for all
your classes So for those of you getting
flunk cards youll find them attached to
last weeks exam

Moans erupt from the class Todd sits motionless at his desk
The moment of truth Proxmire passes him and places the exam
face down on Todds desk Todd hesitates before turning it
over He is sweating

He flips the paper over and glares at the small card clipped to
the top of the paper He picks up the card and reads it Im
sure glad I didnt have to give you one of these for real

Great improvement Todd -- Anne Leland Todd cannot contain
his delight Nearby students stare curiously at the strange boy
beaming over his flunk card

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - DAY

Dussander sits at the table He holds the IOP card out at arms
length to read it The bourbon bottle next to him is empty
Todd sits across from him

DUSSANDER
Well this calls for a celebration no

Dussander gets up and goes to the refrigerator

TODD
Look I guess I owe a lot of this to you
Im not proud of it but its true
DUSSANDER
(eyeing him cautiously)
Your gratitude humbles me
(pause)
How about some Ritz crackers and Velveeta

TODD
Sure what the hell

Dussander goes about his task taking items from the cabinets
etc Todd watches all of this intently but without expression

DUSSANDER
I would have expected you to be doing back
flips down the hallway after such good news
You are so quiet

Todd does not respond

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Today I think I give you the day off from
studying Hows that How about one of my
stories instead I still have a few good
ones saved up

TODD
I dont care Whatever you want

Todd is wringing his hand together nervously under the table
Dussander places a box of crackers on the table and goes back to
the counter

DUSSANDER
Lets see I could tell you about the
special soap we made Or there is always the
story of how I escaped from Berlin after I
was foolish enough to go back That was a
close one I promise you

TODD
Anything really

DUSSANDER
No none of these I think You dont seem to
be in the mood

Dussander slices open a pack of Velveeta and puts it on a plate

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
I think today I will tell you the story of an
old man who was afraid He was afraid of a
certain young boy who was in a queer way
his friend The boy proved to be a very good
student but perhaps not in the way his
mother or his teachers had envisioned At
first the old man disliked the boy intensely
but then he grew to to enjoy the boys
company Of course there was still a great
deal of distrust between them

He puts a glass of Coke in front of Todd and goes back to the
counter He opens a drawer takes something out closes it

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Each knew something that other wanted to keep
secret But over time the old man began to
feel that things were changing He felt his
hold on the boy slipping away from him

Dussander goes to the cellar door His back is to Todd He
opens the door and clicks on the light Todd stands up
silently

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
So One sleepless night the old man got out
of bed and wrote down the story of his
involvement with the boy Everything he
could remember from the first day forward

Todd has moved across the floor careful not to let the floor
creak under his steps He is right upon Dussander Dussander
reaches out with one arm for a fresh bottle grasping onto the
railing with the other His body hangs over the steep
staircase

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
When he finished his hand was stinging from
arthritis but he felt good for the first time
in weeks He felt safe

He gets his balance again and turns to face Todd Dussander
holds the kitchen knife he was using earlier down at his side
where Todd can see it A tense silence passes between them

Todd is frozen Dussander steps past him and back into the
kitchen He closes the cellar door behind him

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
He climbed back into bed and slept until it
was time for General Hospital

Dussander sits back in his chair cutting the seal on the fresh
bottle

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
On the following day the old man put on his
best suit and went down to one of the local
banks and rented a safety deposit box The
bank officer explained to the old man that he
would have a key and the bank would have a
key To open the box both keys would be
needed No one but the old man could use the
old mans key without a signed notarized
letter of permission from the old man
himself With one exception

Todd sinks into a chair across from Dussander and takes a sip of
Coke

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
That exception is made in the event of the
box-holders death

TODD
Then what

DUSSANDER
Then the box is opened in the presence of a
bank official and a representative of the
Internal Revenue Service The contents of
the box are inventoried In this case they
will find only a twelve-page document Non-
taxable but highly interesting

Todd understands what the old man has told him He slams his
glass down on the table and jumps out of his chair

TODD
You cant you cant do that

DUSSANDER
My boy it is already done

TODD
But Christ Look at you You could go at
any time

Todd stares at Dussander in disbelief After a moment he storms
out the back door to the porch

EXT DUSSANDERS BACK PORCH - DAY

Todd is leaning over the rail looking out at the yard when
Dussander steps onto the porch He carries with him the bottle
of bourbon and a glass

TODD
Then there is nothing for me

DUSSANDER
But there is As the years go by as I get
closer to the grave your hold on me will
become worth less and less A man five ten
years older than I worries more about his
ailing heart than being extradited to Israel
And there will come a day - if I live long
enough - when I decide what you know no
longer matters Then and only then I will
destroy my document
TODD
But but so many things can happen to you
in between Accidents Sickness You could
slip in the shower for Christs sake

Dussander shrugs and lights another cigarette He begins to

sing softly then gets caught up in the song Todd turns away angry
DUSSANDER
Que sera sera Whatever will be will
be The futures not ours to see Que

sera sera

Pause Dussander sees he has pressed Todds button He moves
closer

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
My dear boy I see you thinking about it
even now It is in your eyes Killing me
It would take only a flick of a knife Or
maybe push me down the steps make it look
like an accident I am old You are strong
You are angry Good assets for killing But
there is something missing

Dussander speaks with a near whisper in Todds ear

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
To have some one in your control To have
them know that they are alive because you
have not decided to the contrary Do you
have that power Ask yourself It is no
easy question I think you know that

There is a long pregnant pause Then Todd lets out a sigh as if
to dismiss what he has just heard He turns to face Dussander

TODD
You know this means were through You wont
be seeing me around here anymore

DUSSANDER
No I suppose I wont

TODD
Im never coming here again

DUSSANDER
And so it comes to an end Here

Dussander pours a splash of bourbon into the boys glass

TODD
What are you doing

DUSSANDER
A drink To our lives together the
beginning and the end

Todd picks up his glass

TODD
I think you should fuck yourself

He CLICKS his glass against Dussanders

DUSSANDER
My boy dont you see that we are fucking
each other

He drinks Todd reluctantly does the same

FADE TO BLACK

EXT MAIN STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY
TITLE APRIL 1985

Dussander dressed smartly for a day out of the house emerges
from a matinee at the movie theater and strolls down the
sidewalk the umbrella under his arm He stops at an empty bench
and sits to wait for the bus

Archie sits down next to him At first Dussander doesnt pay
attention to him but Archies behavior tells us that he is
keenly aware of Dussanders presence Dussander stares out into
the street but Archie fidgets about his eyes roaming and
finally slides a little closer to Dussander Dussander looks at
him flatly Archie grins Dussander turns away prepared to
dismiss this odd behavior as that of a crazed derelict Then
Archie speaks

ARCHIE
(leaning over)
I notice the kid dont come around no more

Dussander doesnt respond He catches Archie in a glance and
sees that he is staring at him

DUSSANDER
What
ARCHIE
Little blond-hair boy Whats the matter

you aint his friend no more

Dussander is like stone flashing the eyes of a man who is not
to be harassed Finally

DUSSANDER
You mistake me for somebody else Pardon
me my bus is coming
Dussander stands slightly rattled only to those who know him
well He looks down the street for the bus Archie doesnt
move Rather he inspects Dussander from head to toe stopping
on the shoes

ARCHIE
Damn Cuban high heels Nice ones too

The SQUEAL of brakes grows louder as the bus comes to rest in
front of Dussander He has become perceptibly more nervous as
he waits for the passengers to exit He climbs up the first
step

ARCHIE
I aint seen a pair like that since I was in
Havana
(talking louder because of the
bus)
Thats the only place you can getem Cant
getem exported Government dont let you

The door closes behind Dussander The bus pulls away Through
the window of the bus Dussander watches Archie as he continues
his speech to no one

INT HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY

beeps and she picks it up

Todd approaches a door marked Dr Carl N Morgan - Principal
He goes in

INT HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

Todd opens the office door As his eyes scan the floor he
notices a familiar pair of yellow high-tops He looks up to see
Ed French leaning against the wall Seated at the desk is
MORGAN a thin stern man around 50 Todds face shows a
moment of trepidation but he regains his composure almost
instantly

MORGAN
Have a seat Todd

Todd does as Morgan pours over Todds files

MORGAN (CONTD)
I see from your record and from what Mr
French tells me that after a minor slip up
last semester youre right back on course
Straight As for the quarter so far And I
hear your little slip didnt bother the folks
up at Stanford too much either

FRENCH
A good break for you Todd

MORGAN
Looks like that little talk with your
(looks at file)
grandfather really helped Well we dont
want to keep you too long
(to French)
You tell him

FRENCH
Well it seems Sally Chong didnt do to well
in AP biology

MORGAN
She failed it

FRENCH
Im afraid so She refused to take part in
the fetal pig dissection The teacher begged
her to drop the class but Sally thought she
could pass anyway

MORGAN
Stubborn girl What were telling you son
is that because Sally Chang -

FRENCH
Chong

MORGAN
Because Sally Chong wouldnt hack up a baby
pig you snuck by her in the rankings So if
you can keep your grades up for two more

months -- any reason that shouldnt happen
TODD
No
MORGAN
Then youll make valedictorian Todd
Congratulations
FRENCH

Congratulations Todd

French shakes Todds hand an uneasy moment passes between the
two of them
INT HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY

Todd comes out of Morgans office French follows him

FRENCH
Todd you really should be proud of yourself
To tell you the truth Im amazed you pulled
it off

TODD
Thanks I guess

He starts to walk away

FRENCH
I was glad to hear you made varsity baseball
I spoke to the coach He says your coming
along real well

TODD
Thanks

FRENCH
Its turning out to be a good year for you

TODD
Yeah

He turns to go but French stops him again

FRENCH

He steps up to Todd and lowers his voice as if he were hedging
a touchy subject

FRENCH (CONTD)
Todd youve got a lot of good things going
on right now You should be enjoying
yourself

TODD

FRENCH
How are things at home

Todd realizes he is not going to get out of this easily

TODD
Look things with my parents were bad for a
while But theyre doing a lot better

He is pulling away from French as he speaks

FRENCH
(unconvinced)
Okay Todd I know this isnt the place to
talk about this But my door is always open

TODD
I know Thanks

Todd walks away

FRENCH
And its going to stay open

But Todd does not turn around French stares after him The
BELL RINGS and Todd is swallowed by the stream of students
emerging from the class rooms

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Todd is kneeling down at the bike rack His backpack is on the
ground next to him He unlocks his bike and begins to coil the
chain around his wrist when Joey walks by He sees Todd and
considers going by but stops We can tell they havent spoken
in a while

JOEY
Hey there

Todd looks up He seems pleasant but there is little warmth in
his voice

TODD
Hey

Pause They look at each other Joey wants to talk Todd
slips the chain lock into a pocket on his backpack Joey
jingles his car keys anxiously

JOEY
I ah I heard about Stanford I heard a
couple of weeks ago actually Congrats
TODD
Thanks
JOEY

I got into school to Long Beach Its no
Stanford but

Joey shrugs Its an awkward moment He walks closer

TODD
No no thats good Joe
JOEY
Well I just wanted to say hi Here let
me get that

Joey reaches for Todds backpack He lifts it The heaviness
puzzles him Todd takes it from him

JOEY (CONTD)
What do you have in there

Todd stares at him stone-faced Joey doesnt like Todds
expression Todd takes the bag from him and puts it on

TODD
You busy now

JOEY
Uhh

TODD
Come with me Hop on

JOEY
Hop on I have a car now Todd

TODD
You cant drive where were going

EXT DIRT PATH - DAY

Joey sits on the handle bars as Todd pedals over the rugged
terrain Joy looks scared but appears to be enjoying the ride
and the chance to be with his old friend

The next shot shows Todds bike laying on the ground The
wheels still turn slowly The camera moves to reveal Todd and
Joey standing on a rocky ledge Orange Country sprawls out
before them

Under the cross-hairs of a telescopic sight a truck from the
freeway below zooms out of frame The image vanishes We see
Joey looking through the scope which he holds in one hand

JOEY
This is so cool

TODD
Point it over here Thats the middle
school You can see right into our old class
room

JOEY
Oh yeah But I still dont see what you

need the rest of it for Doesnt your Dad
notice
The hunting rifle disassembled sticks out of Todds backpack
on the ground

TODD
He hasnt yet

JOEY
Yet Jesus Todd

He is trying to joke but the seriousness is clearly in his
voice

TODD
And over here thats your dads office And
theres the old drive-in

Joey isnt looking through the scope anymore He holds it out
to Todd watching him

JOEY
Here Take it

Todd grabs the scope But Joey doesnt let go He finally
locks Todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months He
wants to say something Todd takes the scope He sees that
Joey is serious He takes a few steps toward the edge toward
the gun He looks out

TODD
Its such a rush you know To be up here
Dont you feel it So high above them they
never know were here Its like an ant

farm Were the gods on Mt Olympus Joey
They cant see us they cant hear us but
every so often we can make them feel us
Just so they never forget Look

He looks through the scope at the freeway He picks out passing
cars

TODD (CONTD)

There goes a future track star There goes a
judge A mom and her two kids A policeman
That ones a school teacher that ones a
drug dealer You see Joey it doesnt
matter It doesnt matter how smart you are

or how many grades you skip Theres
always someone who can take it all away The
right person snaps their fingers and its
done

Joey takes a few steps backward Todd doesnt notice

JOEY
Todd Im gonna go Im gonna walk home
Todd turns his head toward Joey but it is as though no one is
there He looks away again

JOEY (CONTD)
Todd

Pause Todd looks again But this time Joey is really gone A
slight chuckle escapes Todds mouth

EXT DUSSANDERS STREET - EVENING

TITLE JUNE 1985

Dussander plods down the sidewalk with his sacks of groceries
He is a little more winded moves a little slower than

previously

Suddenly Archie emerges from behind a group of trees He moves
quickly up to Dussander catching him off guard

ARCHIE
I can do that I can help you carry those

Dussander jumps back Archie stops

ARCHIE (CONTD)
You dont gotta be afraid JI can carry those

Dussander does not move But slowly his face changes and we
realize that he remembers Archie from the bus stop

DUSSANDER
I dont need any help Excuse me

He starts off again Archie follows

ARCHIE
Hey I aint a bad guy You dont gotta
worry Ima veteran I just want--
DUSSANDER

(snapping at him)
What What do you want Why do you bother me

Archie is taken aback by the sudden viciousness

ARCHIE
(plaintively)
You got a nice face

DUSSANDER
No I dont

ARCHIE
Look were practically neighbors I stay
right over there most nights
(pointing across the street)
I see you walking down the street JI come up
to help Its called being neighborly

They are nearing Dussanders yard

DUSSANDER
Piss off

Fed up with his belligerence Archie strips the bags from
Dussanders hands with ease Dussander knows he is outmatched

ARCHIE
Aint no reason to be rude You see I know
something about you I know your a nice
guy Im nice too just like the kid

Dussander looks up and down the street No one is around

DUSSANDER
I see

ARCHIE
And I know you got some bourbon in these
bags I aint ashamed to say I could use a
drink about now But I dont need no charity
If you want to invite me in like a friend
we could have a nice drink

DUSSANDER
A drink

ARCHIE
Thats what Im saying

Long pause

DUSSANDER
You smell like a toilet

ARCHIE
Maybe you let me use your shower But first
a drink After that Ill do anything you say

INT DUSSANDERS LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Dussander and Archie come through the front door Archie scans
the room

ARCHIE
Yeah this is nice Real nice

DUSSANDER
Let me take those
(takes the bags)
Right this way
Dussander moves toward the kitchen Archie watches him walk
away A smile crosses his face as he follows him to the kitchen

INT LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - EVENING

Todd and his parents are together in the living room Todd is
studying for his trigonometry final Monica sits at the couch
addressing graduation announcements Dick is at his desk
pouring over a pile of receipts

MONICA
I guess your parents dont need a graduation
announcement

DICK
No

TODD
Grandma and Grandpa arent coming

MONICA
(to Dick)
I thought you told him

DICK
Christ I forgot Todd my aunt Patty Dads

to drive up to Fresno to settle her estate
We cant ask Dad to drive six hours each way

MONICA

DICK

Todd thinks for a moment realizes something

TODD
Of course Dad Its all right Tell
Grandpa Ill spend the week with him and
Grandma when they get back

MONICA
What about Mr Denker I almost forgot about
him

TODD

No He wont want to come

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN and BASEMENT - EVENING

Archie seated at the table with his back to Dussander is in
the middle of a sprawling monologue about his life to which
Dussander half-listens Dussander goes to the cabinets and
takes out two glasses He pours the drinks and sets the glasses
on the table Archie picks his up and is about to drink

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Ah-ah

Dussander picks up his glass to toast Archie Archie CLINKS his
glass to Dussanders and downs the shot

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
I believe we need another bottle my friend

ARCHIE
Well if youre offering Im accepting

Dussander goes to the cellar door to retrieve another bottle

DUSSANDER
No trouble at all Now where is my bottle
opener Ah here it is

Dussander pulls something out of a drawer He goes to the table
and stands right behind Archie

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Why dont you drink mine

Archie picks up the glass and begins to drink slower this time
Dussander pulls Archies tattered hat off his head and sets it
on the table He then begins to stroke the matted knots of
Archies hair

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
You dont mind do you

ARCHIE
No I dont mind Maybe in the morning -
everything goes okay - you could let me have
ten dollars

DUSSANDER
Perhaps

ARCHIE
Maybe even twenty

DUSSANDER
Perhaps We shall see

Pause

ARCHIE
You can relax you know Ive done this before

DUSSANDER
Its all right So have I

Dussander raises a meat fork up to the back of Archies neck

He starts to plunge it in just as Archie turns back to look at
him The fork goes in crooked Archie explodes from the chair
HOWLING his arms flailing like those of a grizzly bear With
the fork protruding from his back Archie tosses the table to
the side The empty bottle tumbles to the middle of the floor
and shatters Archie spins and slams a fist into Dussanders
temple Dussander collapses against the counter Archie moves
about wildly trying to grab the fork and pummel Dussander at
the same time Blood is streaming freely from his wound

Dussander grabs a frying pan from a rack of drying dishes on the
counter As Archie approaches Dussander swings the pan into
Archies descending fist Archie winces and staggers backward
He stomps down on the broken bottle and screams His guard
falls briefly Dussander is upon him He swings the pan
catching Archie squarely in the face

Archie brings his hands up to his face which now oozes with
blood Blinded by the blow Archie charges Dussander who
crouches to the side and as Archie passes hurls himself into
the mans back sending him through the open door of the cellar
Archie flies down the stairs face-first tumbling into the
packed dirt floor like a derailed train Dussander exhausted
and bloodied exhales deeply Looking down at the crumpled body
below he straightens his tie brushes the hair from his face
and then surveys the kitchen

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
What a mess

He rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the
steps to finish the bum for good After about three steps he
stops abruptly He appears puzzled but after a moment the
expression changes A look of searing pain rushes across his
face Dussander brings his hand to his chest He collapses on
the stairs He is having a heart attack and knows it

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Oh my God

He looks down at Archie up to the kitchen then back down to
the cellar A moment of decision

The stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they
did a minute ago Getting to his feet he turns slowly toward
the kitchen He starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace
counting with each step

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Ein Zwei Drei

INT LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

INTERCUT between Todd in his living room and

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dussander leaning against a wall in his blood-stained kitchen
The wall above Dussander read 650

DUSSANDER
Come over right away boy Im having a
heart attack a bad one I think

TODD
Gee that sounds exciting Mr Denker but I

DUSSANDER

DUSSANDER
Tell your parents Ive had a letter an
important letter and I need you to read it

TODD

DUSSANDER
Now we see what you are made of boy

Dussander hangs up the phone and falls into a chair

INT LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT

TODD
Bye

Ive got to run over to Mr Denkers for a
minute

MONICA
Is everything all right
TODD
Oh he just got a letter from a nephew in
Hamburg or Dusseldorf or one of those places

DICK

Todd zips up his jacket

TODD

MONICA
I dont know you have a final tomorrow

TODD
I know I was almost finished studying anyway

DICK
Dont be gone too long Todd

TODD
See you in a bit

He kisses Monica on the cheek He is out the front door

EXT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT

Todds driving reflects his state of mind erratic and out of
control He meets a police car at an intersection and almost
runs a red light The police car doesnt bother him however
and a moment later he pulls the Honda up to Dussanders house

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Todd appears in the door of the kitchen His face tells us that
what he sees is ten times worse than whatever he expected The
room is a gruesome sight Blood and broken glass are
everywhere The table has been knocked to the side Dussander
barely conscious slumps in a chair

TODD
What the fuck

Todd moves to the center of the room careful not to step in any
blood He doesnt know what to do His attention falls on
Dussander Suddenly he rushes to him and begins to inspect his
body carefully

TODD (CONTD)
Where are you bleeding wake up

Dussander does not respond Todd shakes him harder
TODD (CONTD)
Wake up goddamnit

Dussander stirs a little aggravated

TODD (CONTD)
I thought you said you had a fucking heart attack

DUSSANDER
Its not my blood for Christs sake

Pause

TODD
What did you say

DUSSANDER
It was self-defense boy Go downstairs
Youll see what needs to be done

Dussander points to the open cellar door

TODD
Fuck you Im not going down there What
happened What did you do

Dussander only stares back at him then looks away almost
smiling through his incredible pain as if to challenge Todd

TODD (CONTD)
What the hell is this

Dussander does not respond Todd stares at him for a moment

then moves toward the cellar

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT

Todd is half-way down the stairs when he freezes Sprawled out
on the ground below him is Archie motionless The meat fork
still protrudes from his neck like an antenna

TODD
Jesus Fucking Christ

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Suddenly Dussander is more awake than we realize When he hears
Todd discover the body he slides his chair over to the cellar
door and slams it shut His face is red with pain as he pushes
the dead bolt into place locking Todd in the cellar

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT and KITCHEN - NIGHT
Todd races up to the door He tries the handle and then pounds
on the door with his fist The following conversation cuts back
between Todd and Dussander on opposite sides of the door

TODD
Open the fucking door Right now Right
now

Dussander shoves his chair under the doorknob He drags the
table against the door as he speaks Todd is screaming on the
other side and begins to kick at the door violently

DUSSANDER
You give me no choice boy

TODD
What are you doing Open the door

DUSSANDER
If you wont help me then Ill make you help
me If you dont we are finished

TODD
Fuck you old man This is your problem I
didnt do this Open the door

Todd pounds awayat the door Tears now stream down his cheeks
His relentless pounding has Dussander enraged Dussander pounds
back at the door to shut Todd up It works

DUSSANDER
Enough Enough Enough If you dont stop
screaming like a fucking school girl Im
going to

A surge of pain from his chest silences him He recovers
speaking slowly and deliberately

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
Now listen to me boy very carefully If
you dont help me Im going to die here
And if I die there is no Stanford for you
There is no scholarship There is jail My
document

TODD
Fuck your document I got nothing to do with
this Dont make it sound like I do I came
here I saw this shit and now Im getting
the fuck out of here Thats what Im gonna
tell the police

DUSSANDER
Why not tell them the truth Tell them I
locked you in the cellar Tell them I
wouldnt let you out until you buried the
body
TODD
Im not listening to this

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT

Todd runs down the stairs and leaps over Archies body Under
the dim glow of a single naked bulb hanging from the ceiling he
searches for a way out He crosses the dirt floor toward a tiny
window high on the opposite wall

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

DUSSANDER
You must be at the window yes As you can
see I had it barred a few years ago A bad
element started to move into the
neighborhood you know how it is

TODD (0S)
Fuck

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT

Todd realizes he cant get through the bars He turns around to
find another option In the obscured background Archie begins
to stir Silent and bewildered he feels the area around him
and rises slowly to his knees Todd doesnt see him and moves
into a dark corner of the cellar rummaging through the piles of
cluttered junk for something to help him escape He disappears
for a moment into complete darkness and then emerges holding a
shovel a fresh confidence on his face He holds it like a
sledge hammer

DUSSANDER (0S)
We are wasting time now boy
(switches to a loud whisper)
Come back to the door You are not going to
find anything down there to help you

TODD
(to himself)
Oh really

Todd runs toward the staircase and is only a few feet from
Archie when he sees him Todd mortified lets out a scream
This startles Archie who cannot speak He only gurgles a
SICKENING WHINE the fork still sticks out of his neck Blood
drips into his eyes from a gash above his forehead Yet even on
his knees he is an imposing figure

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT
Dussander puzzled by the commotion presses his ear against the
door

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT
Archie blocks the stairs from Todd

TODD
Get out of the way

But Archie is too disoriented to move Summoning all his
courage Todd pokes the shovel into him as if to prod him out
of the way

But when the blade of the shovel touches him Archie counters
violently grabbing the metal end and swinging it to the side
Todd holds tightly to the handle an act which sends him flying
across the cellar The shovel stays with Archie and now he
wields it like it were a childs toy He slashes it viciously
through the air Todd hides under the stairs watching Archie
duel with the shadows Todd bumps into something Archie hears
him Through the slats in the staircase we see Archie jabbing
the shovel at Todd

TODD
Stop it Stop it

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Alarmed Dussander reaches for the lock but hesitates forever
mindful of the chance of being duped His ear goes back against
the door

DUSSANDER
What are you doing boy Its not going to
work whatever it is

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT

Archie pushes the shovel in too far and cant retrieve it Todd
grabs the other end and pulls it through

TODD
Fuck this

Fed up he comes around from under the stairs and confronts
Archie Archie sees him and takes a step toward him

TODD (CONTD)
I mean it get the fuck away from me

Archie steps closer Instantly Todd tightens his grip on the
shovel He is no longer afraid He swings the shovel at
Archies head striking him Archie staggers back stunned but
then charges forward Todd strikes him again this time with
more force and anger Todd lifts the shovel to strike again
but this time catches the ceiling light with the metal blade
The glass shatters The room goes black

A second later we HEAR a SHARP authoritative BLOW followed
quickly by another then another

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dussander knows something is wrong He slides the bolt back and
slowly turns the handle He opens the door slightly and speaks
into the darkness

DUSSANDER
Hello

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT

A shaft of dull light from the kitchen cuts across the cellar
floor revealing Archies slain body An expanding pool of
blood seeps out from his head As the door upstairs opens
wider the light falls on Todd standing over Archie the shovel
still in his hands his face spattered with blood

The Todd we knew only a minute ago has been transformed He
stares up at Dussander not with the eyes of a boy but with
those of a man A man who can no longer be saved

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Quietly Dussander moves away from the door leaving Todd alone
with what he has done He slides the furniture away from the
door knowing as Todd does that the two of them are now
working together

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - LATER

Todds face is suddenly illuminated as he screws a fresh light
bulb into the dangling cord He picks up the shovel Archies
body still lies where it fell Todd goes to the open area of
the floor and with a forceful stomp plunges the shovel into the
dirt

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT - LATER

Todd smacks the back of the shovel on the finished grave to pack
the dirt then smooths the area over to destroy any markings

He is sweaty dirty and tired But his manner is cool and
efficient as he concentrates intently on the matters at hand

He runs upstairs hopping over the bloody spot where Archies
body used to be
INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Todd bursts through the door He notices the old man in his
chair Dussander doesnt look good Todd levels his eyes at
him His voice snaps with the authority of an SS commander

TODD
Wheres the fucking pinesol

Dussander points to the cabinet under the sink Todd throws the
door open and pulls out bottles of cleaner

TODD (CONTD)
Rags I need rags

DUSSANDER
Cellar Under the stairs

Todd checks the clock it is 925 He gets the bottle anda
bucket and goes for the cellar

INT DUSSANDERS BASEMENT - NIGHT

A SERIES OF SHOTS showing Todd cleaning up the mess He is on
the stairs sponging up the blood Then we see him skimming the
area where the pool of blood was with the shovel The NEXT SHOT
has him sprinkling fresh dirt over the same area Then on his
knees he carefully picks up bits of broken glass from the light
bulb and drops them into a bucket In the FINAL SHOT Todd
stands on the steps as his eyes comb the cellar The shovel has
been cleaned and replaced The floor looks smooth and even
Satisfied he goes upstairs

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

The table has been put back in its spot Todd is in his boxer
shorts A SHOT of a washing machine somewhere else in the

house shows us that Todd is cleaning his bloodied clothes Now

he is washing the dishes in the sink The water in the sink is

a murky pink He pulls the meat fork from the suds and holds it up

TODD
I ought to run this through your chest you
know that

DUSSANDER

It couldnt hurt more than a heart attack
He looks at the clock - 1015

TODD
Christ my parents are going to freak
DUSSANDER
Stay calm boy You are doing fine

Todd dries the murder weapon and puts it away For a moment he
slows down a hint of a smile suddenly comes over him
Dussander sees something is different about him

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
What are you thinking about

The sound of Dussanders voice snaps Todd out of his funk He
is all business again

TODD
Fuck off

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

Todd is back in his clothes He wears a white T-shirt He
brings a knife up to Dussanders neck and slices down his suit
still stained by Archies blood

TODD
Your pants are okay The shoes no

Todd takes off Dussanders shoes and balls them up in the
tattered suit

TODD (CONTD)
Put this on

He holds up Dussanders bathrobe The old man slips into it
with difficulty as Todd dumps the bloodied clothing into a trash
bag Dussander looks at Todds T-shirt

DUSSANDER
Is that my undershirt

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

The blood and glass have been removed Todd runs a mop over the
floor His job is almost over Sweat pours down his face The
same for Dussander

DUSSANDER
Hurry up for Gods sake

TODD
Dont you die on me you old bastard Not
now

Todd puts the mop away He surveys the room as before
Dussander does the same There is a strange silence as the two
of them look around the room for anything damning
DUSSANDER
I think were okay

TODD
Me too

DUSSANDER
Call an ambulance

Todd turns to face Dussander He brings his face up to his and
speaks softly

TODD
The key

DUSSANDER
What are you talking about

TODD
The safety deposit box I want the key

DUSSANDER
For Gods sake boy

TODD
I want the key and I want to know where the
bank is

Dussander cannot argue
DUSSANDER

Hillcrest Savings on Domingo Avenue The key

is behind the clock on the mantle piece
INT DUSSANDERS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Todd goes straight for the mantle He moves the clock and finds
the key
INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Todd holds a blank piece of paper in front of Dussander and
hands him a pen

TODD
Sign this

DUSSANDER
What for

TODD
Sign it

Dussander starts to scrawl his name across the paper
TODD
No At the bottom neatly

With great difficulty Dussander does as he is told Todd folds
the paper and stuffs it into his pocket with the pen He picks
up the phone and dials

DISPATCHER (VO)
911 emergency Do you need an ambulance

TODD
Yes Its my friend Mr Du--

Todd nearly bites his lip in half Dussander notices the slip
and cringes

TODD (CONTD)

TODD (CONTD)
It smells too clean in here

Todd sees a pack of cigarettes on the table
TODD (CONTD)
(offering)
Cigarette
Dussander is not amused Todd lights two cigarettes and lets
them burn down in the ashtray He picks up the phone again and

dials

TODD (CONTD)

TODD
Okay

He hangs up He sits down across from Dussander The old man
is near death but through the slit of an eye he watches Todd
The stare between them is lethal For a long moment this
continues until

TODD (CONTD)
Fuck

DUSSANDER
What What is it

TODD
The letter Where is the goddamn letter I
told my parents I came over to read you a
letter from Germany

DUSSANDER
A letter Yes well say its from Willi
Frankel --

TODD

We need a letter JI told them it was your
nephew I think

DUSSANDER
My bedroom Look in the dresser Second no
third drawer from the top There is a
small wooden box You will have to break it
open I lost the key There are letters
very old ones From a friend All in
German None of them are signed or dated A
page or two will be fine

Todd turns to go and stops

TODD
Are you crazy I dont read German you numb
fuck

DUSSANDER

Why would Willi write me in English If you
were to read me the letter in German I would
understand even though you would not Your
pronunciation would be terrible but I could
manage --

TODD
All right All right

Todd dashes out of the room

EXT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

Dicks Porsche speeds along the same streets that Todd took two
hours earlier

INT DUSSANDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Todd bursts through the door and drops to his knees in front of
the dresser He yanks on the drawer It comes half way out and
stops

TODD
Goddamn you come out

The drawer flies out knocking Todd back He digs through it
the contents of Dussanders fake lives spilling about the room
He finds the box at the bottom As he expected it is locked
Without a moments hesitation he slams the box down on the post
of the bed frame It doesnt open but bits of the frame fly
across the room

On the third attempt the tiny box shatters Todd freezes cocks
his head Outside he hears the distinct ROAR and sputter of the
Porsche engine He grabs two pages of a letter There is
nothing he can do about the mess in the room He closes the
door on his way back to the kitchen

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

Todd enters the kitchen and places the pages on the table just
in time to look up and see Dick standing in the kitchen doorway

TODD
Dad

We hold on Dick for a moment as he takes it all in Dussander
Todd and the room A hint of uncertainty crosses his face

INT DUSSANDERS KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

A PARAMEDIC straps Dussander onto a stretcher Todd is talking
to the other one

TODD
He started laughing at something in the
letter JI dont know what it was its in
German

Dick sees the letter on the table and picks it up Todd watches
him Without much of a thought Dick puts the letter back on
the table

PARAMEDIC
Well well take care of him now Were
going to take him to St Lukes Its a good

very slowly begin to turn

BEN

DUSSANDER

stare at Dussander

INT HILLCREST SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

The BANK CLERK behind the counter is a fat elderly woman
pleasant-faced and not too sharp Todd stands solemnly on the
other side of the counter She stares hard at a piece of paper
We see that it is a note Please allow my grandson Todd to
retrieve my insurance documents from my safety deposit box
Thank you Arthur Denker It is Dussanders phony signature
at the bottom

TODD
Hes really sick Please

The woman looks up at Todd the key in his hand then back down
at the note

INT BANK SAFE - DAY

The woman inserts her key into the first lock and Todd does the
same in the second A moment later he is holding the box in his
hands

BANK CLERK
I sure hope your granddaddy feels better
You can bring that in here

She escorts him to a small room where he can view the contents
of the box She leaves

INT BANK - SMALL ROOM - DAY

Todd puts the box on a table and opens it It is nearly empty
a few old photographs some financial records There is no
document Todd is swept up in a wave of emotion-- anger
relief contempt Hes been played like a fool but is
nonetheless grateful Ultimately he is so overwhelmed a laugh
springs from his lips

TODD
Son of a bitch

He scoops out the contents of the box and puts them in his pocket

INT BANK SAFE - DAY

On the other side of the door the clerk listens curiously to
Todds words She pushes her ear against the door to hear more

EXT WOODED AREA - DUSK

Todd has dug a hole in a remote location He empties the
letters the SS uniform and the contents from the safety
deposit box into the hole A little lighter fluid A match
Todd watches the evidence burn

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER

Todd stands next to the bed holding a small clump of flowers
Dussander notices the bouquet

DUSSANDER
You shouldnt have
Todd is aware that Ben is listening even though he is
pretending not to Todd goes to put the flowers in a glass of
water He sets the glass on the table by the bed

TODD
Theyre from my mother

He sits in the chair by the bed and lowers his voice

TODD (CONTD)
Here

He flicks a tattered photo onto the bed We recognize it as one
from the safety deposit box It is a black and white portrait
of a woman and a small boy

TODD (CONTD)
Everything else I burned

Dussander grins weekly

DUSSANDER
I had to protect myself from you boy

Todd drags a screen over to prevent Ben from hearing Long pause

DUSSANDER (CONTD)
I suspect that we shall never see each other
again

TODD
No I dont think we will

Dussander looks almost hurt to hear Todd say it Pause

TODD (CONTD)
Well I better go

DUSSANDER
Wait boy There is something I want to ask
you

TODD
What

Dussander waves him over with his finger Reluctantly Todd
brings his ear an inch from Dussanders mouth

DUSSANDER
Was it like you thought

Todd pulls his head back stands up He contemplates the
question confessing He touches Dussander on the shoulder

TODD
I should go
He turns for the door

DUSSANDER
Perhaps perhaps I could persuade you to
wait here just until I fall asleep This
medicine makes me quite woozy please

Todd resigns himself to stay He picks up a magazine and begins
to read not even looking at Dussander

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER

Todd emerges from behind the screen toward the door Dussander
is asleep

BEN
Excuse me young man

Todd is startled

BEN (CONTD)
Youre a fine boy to visit your grandfather
like that

TODD
Thanks But hes just a friend

BEN
Is that right Well you are a good friend
to him Tell me is he bad off He doesnt
talk much

TODD
The doctors say hell be out soon

BEN
That is good news indeed Tell me from the
way he speaks Id guess hes been
naturalized like me Is he

Todd is starting to be wary of where this is going

TODD
Hes from Germany From Essen Do you know
that town

BEN

I was only in Germany once Im Polish
Originally I mean Im from Radom I wonder
if he was in the war

TODD
I really couldnt say

BEN
It doesnt matter I suppose It was a long
time ago the war Soon in this country we
may have a president born after the war was
over How about that

Todd starts to leave

TODD
Im sure youre right

BEN
Your friend is lucky to have you A great
man once said No man is an island entire of
itself

TODD
John Donne Take care sir

Todd heads for the door He stops turns back to Dussanders
bed He contemplates something waking him He decides
against it

TODD (CONTD)
Good-bye

BEN
Good-bye

Todd exits Ben sits quietly for a moment thinking He turns
on the television-- The Price is Right We hear it over the
following Ben glances over at the screen which separates him
from Dussander Slowly his eyelids begin to get heavy He
starts to nod off But as sleep begins to envelope him his
eyes suddenly fly open A surge of terror burns across his
face

He sits up frightened A single crutch stands next to the bed
He grabs it He strips away his covers and the restraints on
his leg once or twice shoving his hand over his mouth to quell
a painful scream He gets to his feet awkwardly hobbling
half-dragging his bad leg Every step he takes is a study in
agony

ANGLE on the screen It slides out of the way revealing Ben
staring down at the sleeping Dussander In the pained struggle
to keep silent he brings his face right up to Dussanders
close enough to smell his breath

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

Ben stumbles out of his room into the hall The crutch falls to
the ground He slides against the wall toward the nurses
station Tears stream down his face As he clutches the wall
we glimpse the faded green numbers on his forearm

He reaches the nurses desk She is on the phone He grabs her
by the shoulder and pulls her face up into his She lets out a
startled SCREAM But Bens emotion stops her from resisting
He is sobbing uncontrollably Orderlies appear and pull him off
of her He collapses to the ground consumed by grief

BLACK

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Dussander slowly wakes up for the first time since his surgery
A large black man DARREN stands above him changing the IV bag
He notices Dussander is awake Dussanders voice is low and
hoarse from hours of sedation

DUSSANDER
Wheres the nurse

DARREN
My name is Darren Ill be taking care of
you from now on Ill tell the doctor youve
woken up

Darren finishes with the IV unit and goes to the door
Dussander watches him a bit puzzled but his eyes are closed
again before Darren is out of the room

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER

Dussander wakes up again Something is different in his room
He looks to the table next to him All his magazines are gone
He looks to the other side of the room Ben is gone his bed
stripped of all linen Finally he looks to the door It is
cracked open Two men in suits are talking in the hallway One
we will come to know as Detective GETTY The other is a
subordinate Dussander is clearly bothered by what he sees He
reaches over for the call button and rings it several times

A moment later Darren comes in Getty sees this and stops
talking He watches Dussander from the hall

DARREN
Did you need something

DUSSANDER
What is going on here Where is Ben

DARREN
Mr Krauss has been moved Im going to give
you something It will help you sleep

Darren readies Dussanders arm for an injection

DUSSANDER
I dont want it Who is that man

Before Dussander can protest Darren sticks him with the needle
DARREN

Your surgery was a success Just try to
relax

FADE TO BLACK

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

WEISKOPF (0S)
(in German)
Wake up Wake up old man

Dussanders eyes open The first thing he sees are three men
all in suits standing over him

DUSSANDER (in German)
Are you speaking to me

The voice comes from WEISKOPF 40s His suit is dark gray
well tailored probably European He speaks eloquently despite
an accent that shows roots of Europe and the Middle East

WEISKOPF
(back in English)
No one else is here

Dussander looks over at Bens former bed

WEISKOPF (CONTD)
Mr Krauss is recuperating elsewhere Are
you awake now Dussander

DUSSANDER
Yes of course but you seem to have me
confused with someone else My name is
Arthur Denker Perhaps you want a different
room --

Weiskopf sits on the edge of the bed Dussander notices the pin
on his lapel A small silver Star of David

WEISKOPF
My name is Weiskopf You are Kurt Dussander

DUSSANDER
I know no one by that name Shall I ring for
the nurse

Dussander reaches for the Call button and stops in horror He
looks at his hands His fingertips are smeared with black ink
He looks up at the men in disbelief

WEISKOPF
The man in the next bed was Benjamin Krauss
He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin
You were responsible for the death of his
wife and two daughters His identification
of you was quite specific Im sure his
reward from my government will help offset
the burden of his broken leg

DUSSANDER
My name is Arthur Denker I am an American--

WEISKOPF
Please dont bother Your papers will not
stand up to serious examination and you know
it

The detective GETTY snaps a few pictures of Dussander The

other man is FBI Special Agent DAN RICHLER

RICHLER
We have all we need here Isaac

DUSSANDER
Who are you men What are your names

RICHLER
My name is Richler FBI This is Detective
Getty from the Orange County Sheriffs
Department

WEISKOPF
And I think you know who I work for When
you get your strength back you will be
moved Until then this entire ward will be
under surveillance You can expect to be in
Tel Aviv by the end of the summer

The three men are out the door

INT TODDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Todds room is dark as he lies on the floor writing something
on a pile of index cards The only light comes from the hallway
through the open door of the bedroom Todd is deep in thought
but from the bits of shredded index cards we can tell the

writing is not coming easily

TODD
The road ahead reveals itself uh God no
The road ahead grrrr The fucking road
ahead

Monica appears in the doorway

MONICA
Todd

Todd doesnt notice her He stares down at the card

Finally he
looks up as if it took her voice a few seconds to register in
his mind His response is hardly audible

TODD
Huh

MONICA
What are you doing there in the dark

TODD
Oh working

Monica reaches in to his room to turn on the light She touches
the switch but then pulls her hand back Todd is back at the
note card She looks at him oddly worried but then steps away
from the door and goes downstairs

Todds lips are moving as if he were speaking to himself He
pauses Then in a sudden gust of inspiration begins to write
furiously He finishes and stands up catching his reflection
in the mirror above his desk In the eerie half-light he
stares at the ghost-like image of himself

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD (GRADUATION) - DAY

quiets Todd begins

TODD

happiness But now so early in our lives
it seems that all we should ask for is to be
at peace with the world because only then
can we be at peace with ourselves

INT DUSSANDERS HOUSE - DAY

Weiskopf and Richler both wearing rubber gloves are carefully
looking through the contents of Dussanders dresser They pour
over everything placing some items in clear plastic bags A
few DEPUTIES are milling around Richler picks up a small
photograph of a young woman Todds voice comes in

TODD (VO)
We learn from our education that we are the
masters of our own destinies We learn what
it is that separates us from the others why
we are special

now as we stand at the doorway to adulthood
is to channel our abilities into our goals

Richler moves to the rail and looks out disgusted He pulls a
handkerchief from his pocket and covers his nose and mouth A
DEPUTY wearing rubber gloves carries the shovel up to him

EXT GRADUATION - DAY - CONTINUING

As Todd speaks he notices his parents Becky various teachers
His eyes stop on Ed French who is looking oddly at something in
the crowd

ANGLE ON FRENCH

French notices an elderly couple walking down the aisles of
seated spectators as if they are looking for someone

TODD (0C)
We forge our own paths Our education is but
a stepping stone to the world

They are Victor and Agnes Bowden looking for Dick and Monica
Todd sees them too He pauses almost imperceptibly He looks
back at French

TODD (CONTD)
Our Our true destinies await us There we
become the

Todds grandparents come down the aisle to see Dick and Monica
in the second row They start to slide in causing a slight
ruckus Dick is surprised to see his parents but smiles and
makes room for them French watches all of this curiously

TODD (CONTD)
There we become the men and women that will
make a difference But we must take away
from this place a sense of purpose for
ourselves We now begin to see the road
ahead It is a road from which we cannot
veer

A connection is made between French Todd and the Bowden

Todd and his family start off As they leave the CAMERA MOVES
to show Ed French working his way through the crowd past the
spot where they had been standing

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
The following series of images appear under music

The quiet wing of this hospital has transformed into a frenzied
sea of reporters cameramen photographers and police officers
Everyone is struggling for a glimpse of the infamous celebrity
through the window that looks into Dussanders room Inside
Weiskopf and Richler are speaking to the doctors Getty stands
to the side instructing the DEPUTY who guards the door

Through all of this Dussander lies like a fossil in his bed as
the bodies whirl around him Darren enters the room to change
Dussanders IV bag

Suddenly the door flies open and a young photographer dashes in
snapping pictures wildly Getty and the other officers descend
upon him The camera flashes Other photographers try to get
in but are blocked Pandemonium

Yet Dussander seems oblivious to the commotion His eyes are
nothing more than glazed slits his mouth hangs open Darren
runs toward the door to help Dussanders eyes open slightly
There is life behind them after all He turns his attention
imperceptibly toward his IV bag

The camera moves away from Dussander to the window Outside in
the parking lot groups of protesters have gathered Some hold
candles Others chant and wave signs News reporters surround
them

INT LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY
ANGLE on a ticking wall clock

Todd appears apprehensive as he sits down on the couch next to
his mother She puts her arm around him He is pale and
glassy-eyed His parents dont look much better Dick is
especially nervous and stands off to the side watching everyone
intently Richler and Weiskopf sit across the room in chairs

RICHLER
Todd my name is Dan Richler Im a special
agent with the FBI This is my associate Dr
Weiskopf

WEISKOPF
Hello

DICK
What kind of doctor are you
WEISKOPF
Im a school teacher

RICHLER
Dr Weiskopf is a professor at the Judaic
Institute in Munich He is assisting the
Israeli government in certain matters He is
here today only as an observer

A moment passes between Weiskopf and Todd

RICHLER (CONTD)
Thanks for calling us up Mr Bowden You
saved us the trouble of tracking through the
911 records

DICK
Actually it was Todds idea to call He
thought we thought there might be some way

we could help your investigation

RICHLER
Todd if you wouldnt mind Id like to hear
about your involvement with Dussander but

you knew him as Arthur Denker right

TODD
Yeah I never knew of that other name till I
saw it in the paper

RICHLER
How did you know him

Todd starts to rub his stomach

TODD
I met him at the movies Last summer He
asked me where to pick up the number seven
bus He said his eyes werent too good
-Will you excuse me for a minute

He gets up before Richler can answer walks toward the stairs

MONICA
You okay honey

TODD
I just gotta use the bathroom Ill be right
back

He vanishes up the stairs They all watch him go Monica turns
to Richler

MONICA
Hes not feeling well

ANGLE on Dick
MONICA (CONTD)
Can I get you some coffee

INT BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

The faucet runs at full blast to hide the noise as Todd digs
through the medicine cabinet and takes out a bottle of Pepto-
Bismol He takes off the cap and gulps down what is left in the
bottle He finishes and takes a few deep breaths

As he turns around he catches his reflection in the mirror An
empty bottle in his hand a bright pink ring around his lips a
few pink splotches down his shirt-- he looks totally ridiculous
Todd cant help but laugh

INT BOWDEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The interview continues The clock ticks on Richler drinks
from a coffeee cup Todd is back in his seat

RICHLER
Todd let me tell you what were really
interested in here You told the admitting
nurse that Denker had a heart attack while
you were reading him a letter

TODD
Thats right I was Thats what I was
doing there It was in German but he
insisted I try to read it anyway Once or
twice he got pissy about the pronunciation
but I asked him what did he want from me I
dont speak German Mr Denker
Dussander got really excited at one point
He yelled out Yes thats what you would do
all right but I didnt know what he was
talking about Then he grabbed his chest

RICHLER
And thats when you called the ambulance
right

TODD
Thats right

RICHLER
Well this is the part we cant figure out
The letter itself Todd do you remember

what happened to it

TODD
I guess it was still on the table I
couldnt swear to it but --
DICK
Wait I saw a letter It was in German I
didnt think anything of it at the time
But yeah it was on Airmail stationery

RICHLER
Then it should still be there This is our
problem

DICK
It isnt

RICHLER
No

MONICA

Maybe somebody broke in

RICHLER
Why would somebody break into his house
simply to steal a letter Unless there
was someone someone right here in Santo
Donato who would want to protect him for some
reason Maybe a close friend or even
another fugitive I know it sounds like a
bunch of Robert Ludlum stuff but when
Dussander was taken to the hospital we think
our Mr X scooted over to the house and
swiped the letter

TODD
That doesnt make sense

RICHLER
Why not Todd

TODD
Well if Denk if he had an old Nazi buddy
in town why didnt he come over himself and
read the letter to him If you could have
heard the way he corrected me at every word--

RICHLER
A good point Except maybe this other fellow
is in a wheelchair or blind

TODD
Guys that are blind dont normally go
scooting out to steal letters

RICHLER
(smiling)
True Did Dussander have any friends that
you knew of

TODD
No not really
RICHLER
How about phone calls

Pause

TODD
No I heard his phone ring maybe five or six
times in all the time I knew him It was
never anything out of the ordinary
Salesmen Wrong numbers

RICHLER

Did you ever hear him speak German on those
occasions

TODD
No He hardly ever spoke German He always
said he would teach me someday but he never
got around to it

WEISKOPF
Did he ever talk about his past

Todd looks at Weiskopf This is the first question he has asked
and Todd is more wary of him than of Richler Todd shrugs
innocently

TODD
Not really Little bits I guess

MONICA

Well dont you remember what he told us at
Thanksgiving

Todd looks at her

MONICA (CONTD)
He said he was in college--

DICK
(shutting her up)
Monica They dont care what we know they
care what Todd knows

Silence Richler notices the tension in the room He looks at
Weiskopf Finally he speaks to Dick

RICHLER

Look Im sure this whole thing has come as a
terrible shock I think weve done enough
for the day

He and Weiskopf stand Dick is almost surprised that they are
leaving so soon

WEISKOPF
Thank you Todd Mr and Mrs Bowden

Weiskopf nods good-bye

DICK
Wait a minute Agent Richler before you
go-- Todds not a suspect in this is he I

mean hes just talking to you right

RICHLER
Thats right

DICK
Because Todd always thought he was helping
that old man We didnt know any of this
before today

RICHLER
Mr Bowden you and Todd have nothing to
worry about I assure you Your son has
been a great service to us Thank you Todd
For now thats all we need Our next step is
to turn that house upside down Were
bringing in some special teams to look
through everything We may come up with
something Well be in touch if we need you

They are almost to the door when Richler stops

RICHLER (CONTD)
Oh Todd by the way
(casually pulls a photo out of a
folder he is carrying)
Have you ever seen this man before

He holds the photo up to Todd It is a picture of Archie in
military dress probably a blow-up of his military ID Todd

stares at it for a moment His face shows no reaction
TODD
No
RICHLER

Okay thanks

He smiles Weiskopf opens the door and the two men leave

After a moment the sedan pulls away Todd turns away from the

face is sweaty and flushed He rocks back and forth as he tries
to reassure himself

TODD
Were okay Were okay Were o-kay

He is almost calm when he nears his house But it doesnt last
He sees something he can hardly believe

TODD (CONTD)
You got to be fucking kidding me

EXT BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

An old Volvo is parked on the street in front of the house
Standing on the porch sneakers and all is Ed French Todd
pulls into the driveway and gets out French has a cautious air
about him as he walks toward Todd

FRENCH
Hello Todd

TODD
Mr French what brings you to the wild side
of town

The two of them are standing on opposites sides of the car
French pulls a folded newspaper page from his pocket He starts
to move around the car toward Todd but Todd circles the other
way keeping the car in between himself and French

FRENCH
Todd I found something troubling in the
morning news Are your parents home

TODD
No

FRENCH
I know the man in this picture is the man who
came to see me

TODD
Its sort of a bad time right now Why dont
you go home

FRENCH
I will But first I need a couple of things
explained to me
INT HOSPITAL - OUTSIDE DUSSANDERS ROOM - DAY

Richler is speaking to the reporters Cameras and lights are in
his face His words are low serving as a backdrop but we can
tell that he is telling them of the plans to relocate Dussander
Weiskopf stands close by

FRENCH (VO)
Todd why dont you tell me what happened

EXT BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

While Todd almost seems to be enjoying this odd dance around the
car French does not

TODD
You know Mr French sometimes one thing
just leads to another and before you know
it things get out of control

FRENCH
Im afraid thats not much of an answer
Todd When do you expect your parents home

TODD
I dont know Ed You want to come in and
wait Ill put on a pot of tea Well talk
about old times

FRENCH
I think you might need some help Todd
Thats why Im here

INT HOSPITAL - DUSSANDERS ROOM - DAY

Dussander is alone in the room as Richler addresses the
reporters outside His eyes open wide and his movements are the
liveliest they have been since he was discovered He reaches
over to his IV unit and begins to disconnect the tube from the
bag

TODD (VO)
You know Youre right I do need help I
really do

EXT BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Todd becomes more animated more threatening with every word
Somehow it is as though French is now retreating from Todd as
they circle the car

FRENCH
Let me help you Todd JI want to Youre
too smart to do anything crazy
TODD
Can I ask you something Ed You dont mind
if I call you Ed now that Im out of your
fucking school do you

FRENCH
What

TODD
You know all this crap you see on TV about
forensics hairs and fibers that stuff

How much of it do think is true and how much
is just bullshit

French is puzzled by the question He has no answer

TODD (CONTD)
Oh how would you know Youre a fucking
guidance counsellor

French stops

FRENCH
Todd this is silly Why dont we go inside

INT HOSPITAL - DUSSANDERS ROOM - DAY

Liquid spills onto the floor as the tube comes loose from the
bag Dussander sits back and pulls the free end of the tube up
to his mouth His lips wrap around it and his face tightens as
he begins to blow

EXT BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
Todd starts moving again French does the same

TODD
Heres a little factoid for ya Ill bet you
didnt know this one Hairs fall out of your
head all the time But its even worse when
youre nervous And you know what Ive
been real fucking high-strung lately

Todd comes around the rear of the car and stops at the door to
the back seat He opens it

FRENCH
Listen Todd Please

Todd bends down to get something from the back seat His voice
is muffled from the inside of the car

TODD
Thats how it all happened you know One
thing lead to another and before I knew it

Todd pops back up holding the rifle fully assembled and aimed
at Frenchs chest

TODD (CONTD)
you showed up in my driveway wearing
those same fucking sneakers

FRENCH
Whoa To--

Todd rapid-fires Frenchs chest explodes red as his lifeless
body sails back onto the grass In the front yard a dozen
birds evacuate a tree in a panicked exodus Todd swoons back on
his heels overcome by something But it isnt pain rather
its a rush of pleasure A laugh slips out

INT HOSPITAL - DUSSANDERS ROOM - DAY

Dussander takes the tube from his mouth and lets it fall to the
floor The camera moves along the tube and stops at Dussanders
arm where it ends He lies back in his bed and waits

EXT BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Todd regains his balance French stares wide-eyed as Todd steps
up to him the muzzle aimed at Frenchs head Todd grins
widely For the first time he looks happy

A single round obliterates half of Frenchs skull Todd chokes
back a giggle like a drunk chokes back a belch

INT HOSPITAL - DUSSANDERS ROOM - DAY

Dussander lurches up in the bed in a spastic contortive fit as
the air embolism reaches his heart His arm flails against the
IV unit sending it crashing to the floor The monitors next to
him reflect a drastic turn in his condition The door flies
open and a pair of nurses charae in through the swarm of
journalists Richler and Weiskopf run in and the eager
cameramen follow The room is bathed in flash explosions as the
nurses try to subdue Dussander

INT BOWDEN HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

Todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the
boxes and boxes of ammunition He lets out a beautifully wicked
laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack He
leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his
shoulder
EXT BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - STREET - DAY

Todd zooms out of the garage on his bike the rifle slung over
one shoulder the backpack over the other He zips past
Frenchs body and out into the street In the distance we hear
the faint but rising wail of sirens

A front door or two slams shut as Todd passes Suddenly he cuts
up between two houses A man standing in his back yard sees
Todd and freezes Todd ignores him He steers the bike through
the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times
before

INT HOSPITAL - DUSSANDERS ROOM - DAY

From above we see Dussanders eyes wide open motionless Yet

the expression on his face is one of odd satisfaction A doctor
pounds on his chest barks orders The trauma team prepares the
defibrillator but we know they are too late

EXT DIRT PATH - DAY

Todd rides fast over the dry rocky ground The wind streaks
back his hair His excitement is as palpable as the grin
dancing across his face

An aerial shot follows him as he angles the bike off the trail
and up a steep embankment As the camera moves ahead of him we
see the crest of the hill and beyond it

The freeway teeming with rush-hour traffic
