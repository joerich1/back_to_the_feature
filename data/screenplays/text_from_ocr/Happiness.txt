ALLEN talks to his psychiatrist BILL MAPLEWOOD

ALLEN
I dunno but whenever I see her
I just want toyou knowI want to
undress her I want to tie her up
and pump her pump pump pump till
she screams bloody murder And then
I want to flip her ass over and
pump her even more and so hard my
dick shoots right through her and
so that my come squirts out of
her mouth Not that I could ever
actuallydo that Oh if only she
knew how I felt how deep down I
really cared for her respected her
she would love me back Maybe
But she hardly even knows I exist
I mean she knows I exist - we are
neighbors we smile politely
at each other But I dont know
how I could ever begin to really
talk to her what can I talk about
I have nothing to talk about
Im boring I know Ive been told
before so dont tell me its not
true Cause its a fact I bore
people People look at me and they
get bored They listen to me and
they zone out bored And for her
to see how boring I amno no no
Its better I say nothing and hope
though right now I have to say
if I were to suddenly jump out of
my window she wouldnt care I mean
shed care of course shed care

I mean she is human but I mean
shed care the way you care about a
stranger you read about in the paper
that jumps in front of a running
subway train a stranger whose name
youre never sure how to pronounce
if its even printed Id be an
anectodemaybe But you know what
Im going to do When I see her
next time as soon as I see her
Im just going to tell hertell her
I find herattractive And thatll
be that Thenthen well see

They dont care about these poor
immigrants Its heartbreaking
Now I believe in unions Im sensitive
to their needs I cried at The Grapes

But that was another time another
place Today unions are just a new
kind of corporation Its tragic but
believe me those teachers making
sacrifices for the union well the
unions not going to make any
sacrifices for them Those union
leaders they go home with pay-checks
the teachers end up with nothing
Now we need people who can be dedicated
who arent in it just for the money
Because this job takes courage
Do you know what some of these
refugees have endured Concentration
camps And now their dream of coming
to America is realized and this
union doesnt care Its all about
greed Selfishness Now Joy can I

double bonus you get the solitude
you need for reflection and
soul-searching and the thrill of
being top of the heap
