Rider and horse have come a long way The CAMERA HOLDS

PANS the rider past and we see another detail strapped
his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray
sash wrapped around it Horse and rider pass moving
to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come
around the corner of the house

EXT THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED SHOT - DEBBIE
LATE AFTERNOON

She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman os

Her little dog has seen him too and is barking

DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of

neck crouching over him Debbie is 11 years old with a
piquant memorable face

EXT THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE

Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about
face that is memorable so that if we were to see her
five or six years later we would know it is she --

the eye color or the slant of eyebrow or a trick of
scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger

Debbies dog begins sniffing at his heels Ethan looks
at them - not unfriendly just a man not used to

ETHAN

Martin checks his stride stares in surprise

MARTHA

ETHAN

MARTIN

Again he starts to lead away

ETHAN
Hold on

Martin stops again

ETHAN
Ill take this

He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating
it
as though it contained something of value Martin
watches
with a touch of resentment Ethan doesnt trust him
Ethan turns and sees the look He doesnt care what
Martin
thinks nor does he explain Martin leads the horse

her eyes are tender

INT EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not
but almost a still-life Loud in the room is the
tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the
in which logs are burning briskly Ben crouches near

BEN

MARTHA

bunkhouse with you tonight

Martin nods and crosses to kiss Martha good night

MARTIN
Good night Aunt Martha Uncle
Aaron
(he hesitates)
Good night Uncle Ethan

Ethan doesnt like being called Uncle -- as we must
know

from the quick look he shoots at Martin But he
acknowledges

it

ETHAN

Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away turns to

BEN

war

AARON
The war ended three years ago boy

BEN

As Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin Deborah

Ethans side and studies him gravely

DEBBIE
Lucys wearing the gold locket you
gave her when she was a little girl

ETHAN
Oh

DEBBIE
She dont wear it much account of it
makes her neck green

LUCY
(aghast)
Deborah
DEBBIE
(defensively)
Well it does But I wouldnt care

if you gave me a gold locket if it
made my neck green or not

Ethan looks at her gravely

ETHAN
Fraid I
(then he remembers
something rises)
Wait

Ethan
He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or
something --
and burrows into it Debbie is at his side

ETHAN
How about this

It is a gold medal or medallion -- something
appropriate to
Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-
colored
satin ribbon
DEBBIE
Oh LOOK My gold locket
She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see
Martha
takes it and reacts at its weight
MARTHA
Its solid gold Ethan I dont
think shes old enough
ETHAN
Let her keep it Just something I
picked up in Mexico
Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbies eager
hand
Aaron hasnt missed the word Mexico and looks sharply
at
Ethan
DEBBIE
Oh thank you Uncle Ethan
LUCY
(to Debbie)
Come along
The two girls leave the main room Martha and Aaron
both
look at Ethan -- half expecting some further
explanation

He turns from them and looks into the fire Martha
begins to

clear the table Aaron gets up takes a pipe and a
spill --

lights it at the fire
ETHAN
Passed the Todd place comin in
What happened to em

AARON
They gave up went back to the
cotton rows Sod the Jamisons
Without Martha I dont know She
wouldnt let a man quit

Ethan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her
dishes
AARON
(change of tone)
Ethan I could see it in you before
the war
(Ethan looks at him)
You wanted to clear out
Martha freezes in what shes doing -- listening
AARON
And you stayed out beyond all need
to WHY
Ethan cant answer but he takes it as a challenge and
almost

welcomes it

ETHAN
(hard)
You askin me to clear out now

AARON
(straightening --
with grave dignity)
Youre my brother Youre welcome
to stay as long as you got a mind
to Aint that so Martha
MARTHA

Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table

(NOTE TO WINTON HOCH This scene should be dramatically

lighted)
ETHAN
Theres sixty double eagles in
there twelve-hundred dollars

He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a
money belt and drops that on the table

ETHAN
An twice that in here

He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh
pieces which he slides across the table
ETHAN
only these got the late Emperor
Maximilians picture on ‘em
Martha picks up one of the gold pieces staring at the

on the coin the same as that on the medal -- staring

then at Ethan Aaron is examining another coin with a
different interest

AARON

Mint fresh not a mark on

em
He glances questioningly at Ethan

ETHAN
So

Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair He raises
seat and lifts out a pair of old boots some rags of
and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and
belt into it Carefully he replaces everything During

Ethans attention has gone to Marthas hand to one cut
finger its wound barely healed He takes the hand --
gently

ETHAN
Cut yourself

She nods and withdraws the hand

ETHAN
(softly)
You were always hurting about your
hands

She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to
hide
her hands conscious of their work-worn appearance

Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- anda
world of
sadness and hopelessness is in the look

Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair

AARON
Time for bed

He picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward
their

bedroom door Martha looks at Ethan again His
expression is

bitter

AARON
Night Ethan Come long Martha

She turns obediently and follows Aaron Ethan looks

after

them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door Martha
goes

into it and Aaron follows and closes the door

Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel blows it out

She looks almost too obviously at Charlie which annoys
Laurie Laurie resumes her letter reading

without conviction)

sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak

Two chunky squaws who have been tending the fire or
grinding

corn in a rock pestle scuttle to a side of the tepee
Two

others one half-grown and the other slightly taller

with their backs to the fire huddled over some leather

barks a

word to the squaws near the fire

strangely remote

He suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands his dusty

Charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling --
trying to imitate Martins crouch Suddenly Martin

The line of Rangers is afoot now each man near his

each man with rifle out pumping shot after shot at the
fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long

with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-—
in mid-ground And then as the firing slackens from
we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the

sign of the approach of Greenhills troop
