This script is shorter than it looks because much of the
fast naturalistic dialogue will involve interruptions
people talking over each other simultaneous dialogue (etc)

Anything in bold and italics is an improvisation Sometimes
we have written out dialogue to give a feel of what kind of
improv it could be sometimes we have just given a general
description
SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 1

INT DOUG AND ABI’S HOUSE - LANDING - DAY 1

We open on a grey background which gradually gains focus and
texture We are also becoming aware of a muddled soup of
sound - distant voice thumping footsteps distorted music
from a TV somewhere

Now the grey background is no longer filling the frame We
realize that is a low-shot of a stone

Suddenly the stone rolls alarmingly towards camera making
us jump A small 4-year-old girl - JESS - is rolling the
stone down an upstairs corridor

INT DOUG AND ABI’S HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 2

The air is filled with the heroic chords from the theme to
the 1958 Kirk Douglas movie “The Vikings”

We are on a CU of a wide-eyed 6-year-old transported boy
He is sitting on the back of a sofa totally rapt as on the
TV lots of Vikings fight an epic battle We can hear his
mother calling in the distance

ABI (OOV)
Mi-ckey

JESS is with some difficulty continuing to roll her grey
stone along the floor

DOUG

INT DOUG AND ABI’S HOUSE - HALL - DAY 5

Fish food is being dropped into a fish tank by a rather
serious-looking 10-year-old LOTTIE

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 2

INT DOUG AND ABI’S HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 7
MICKEY is still hypnotised by the Vikings

behind the sofa

He spots JESS on the landing with her bag he turns very
cheery and positive

DOUG (CONTD)

DOUG (OOV)

the bag)

INT DOUG AND ABI’S HOUSE - MICKEY’S ROOM -DAY 16

MICKEY is rapidly hunting - he finds a toy sword The car
alarm goes off again outside ABI exclaims upstairs JESS
yells its a wall of noise which peaks when MICKEY raises
his toy sword triumphantly above his head with a cry of “For
Odin” and then hurtles towards the camera shouting “CH-A-A-A-
RGE”

EXT HIGHLAND LOCH - DAY 17

Hard cut to the silence of a loch Mist swirls over the water
and the mountains beyond

On the loch is a small boat with a figure sitting in it an
elderly man in his seventies with a fishing rod He is
scruffy and unshaven but has a style and presence This is
GORDIE

We linger a little to take in the silence the grandeur the
tiny figure in the boat

The idyll is punctuated by the trill of a mobile phone
GORDIE lets out a weary groan he lobs the blanket over it
muffling the sound

EXT DOUG AND ABI’S HOUSE - DAY 18

ABI is throwing a football and an armful of teddies into the
back seat of the family car DOUG is loading up the bags

DOUG
So her best friends are stones
now

ABI

(Adjusting the child seat) Not all
of them some of them are bricks

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 6

DOUG
Well have you yknow

ABI
(Still fighting the child seat)
Have I what

DOUG
Have you spoken to anyone about it

ABI
What like a geologist (Still
struggling with the car seat) This
thing hates me

DOUG
Im just saying this obsessive
collecting is rather abnormal
behaviour for a child to -

ABI
(Laden with sarcasm) Oh shes
behaving abnormally is she I
wonder why

DOUG
Oh for Christs sake Abi just -

They discover that LOTTIE is standing right behind them and
instantly snap into smiley mode

DOUG (CONTD)
OK sweetie

ABI
Everything alright

LOTTIE

I just need a list
DOUG

A list
LOTTIE

Yes a list of the lies we have to
tell In case I forget one

DOUG and ABI look at each other

EXT HIGHLAND LOCH - DAY 19

Water laps gently against the side of GORDIE’S boat as he
fishes on the loch His face is a picture of contentment
until he catches a glimpse of something At the far end of
the loch a shiny Range Rover comes over a rise and then
disappears It is heading his way GORDIE mutters something
- probably obscene

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 7

Cut a big ws of the boat on the loch GORDIE is a tiny
figure

Something big runs very quickly across frame in the
foreground Was that an ostrich Surely not

INT DOUG AND ABI’S HOUSE - HALL - DAY 20

ABI enters at speed with LOTTIE dogging her steps MICKEY
has his length of rope and is practising tying knots

MICKEY
That’s a clove hitch (etc)

ABI
Come on In the car Has anyone
seen my house-keys

ABI disappears deeper into the house LOTTIE takes the
responsibility of changing MICKEY’s pullover which he’s put
on the wrong way round Outside DOUG is trying to close the
jam-packed boot of the car

MICKEY
Why arent we flying to Scotland

LOTTIE
Because the volcano in Iceland has
erupted again which means -it’s too
expensive

JESS
I like planes Planes have films in
the seats And ladies with lots of
teeth who bring you stuff And they
have those men who take away your
toothpaste

ABI returns hurrying up the hall calling into the house
while hunting for her keys

ABI
Keys keys

Now DOUG is approaching from the car checking his phone

DOUG
M25’s up the spout

LOTTIE
A list would be really helpful so

DOUG and ABI

ABI
Yes thats right but - (The car
alarm goes off again) Je-sus H

JESS
Youre not supposed to shout
Jesuss name like that

ABI

tells LOTTIE to stay out of it but all this is in the
background as we find DOUG who is now standing on next
doors doorstep Their neighbour LUCY opens the door

DOUG
Oh hi Lucy um Abis managed to
lose her keys somewhere and I need
to lock up so could I just borrow
the spare

He holds his hand out but theres a wary embarrassment in
Lucys eyes

DOUG (CONTD)
(Perplexed) If you could just give

been instructed not to hand him any
keys) Oh

LUCY looks hesitantly towards ABI for reassurance It takes
ABI a moment to register whats happened

smaller mistake where someone does
something that is

another table He starts talking to the phone again

GAVIN

joining up straws to make a fantastically long straw
MICKEY’s in animated conversation with his Mum LOTTIE with

her Dad

DOUG
(to LOTTIE over the babble) For
the last time Lottie no one’s
going to ask you if Mum and me are
living in the same house

LOTTIE
(taking out her notebook) OK

DOUG
Why are you writing that down

LOTTIE
So you can’t say you didn’t say it
if someone does ask me

LOTTIE looks at her watch and writes down the time and date

DOUG
(Turning to MICKEY and JESS) OK
Kids just to remind everyone what
were saying is that when we get to
Scotland nobody must tell anyone
that me and Mum are living in
different houses OK

she was doing a poo

DOUG
Well

Improv on what they can and cant say which includes one of
the little ones asking why they cant tell anyone about the
parents living in separate houses

LOTTIE
It’s lying

DOUG
It’s not lying it’s not
mentioning something

LOTTIE
But what if someone asks me ‘are
your Mum and Dad getting divorced’

DOUG

Lottie youre visiting your
Grandad youre not going on the
Jeremy Kyle Show

An animated discussion begins

42 EXT HILLTOP - DUSK 42
An amazing almost unnatural sunset

KENNETH is with GORDIE who is sitting in an old deck-chair
They are not entirely comfortable together GORDIE offers
KENNETH a beer but he declines

KENNETH sounds 20 years older than he is

KENNETH
Quite a sunset (GORDIE nods) Its
volcanic dust in the air refracting
the low level sunlight

GORDIE
Ah I thought it was those new
pills theyd given me Do you want
a couple of packets of the blue
ones I bet you could make a tidy
profit selling them at school

Its a joke but KENNETH doesnt react

GORDIE (CONTD)
Play something then

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 22

KENNETH has his violin with him He starts to play some
classical music

GORDIE (CONTD)

No no the proper stuff I know
you like it Ah Kenny you need to
cut loose(KENNETH hesitates) Go
on go mental

KENNETH
«Dad says I need to concentrate on
my exam pieces

He resumes the classical piece GORDIE quietly shakes his
head

INT TOWN - CAFE - DUSK 43

stop JESS and MICKEY shouting out her pin number LOTTIE is
talking to her DAD

LOTTIE

So youll tell Grandad about you

better

DOUG
(A little hesitant) Yeah Yes

DOUG
No no weve told you everything

LOTTIE gets out her book to write this down

DOUG (CONT’D)
(He turns to ABI) I’m glad we
stopped It’s actually quite nice
here

They come out a door into the high street

EXT TOWN - DUSK 44
They walk into a wall of noise

The pretty country town high street has transformed into an
alcohol-fuelled Saturday night orgy of drinking shouting and
fighting Fat men stripped to the waist drunk girls on very
long heels having slanging matches police restraining a man
ambulance lights flashing (etc)

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 23
44

ABI JESS and MICKEY join LOTTIE and DOUG They stare in
amazement and horror

LOTTIE
Is this another riot

DOUG
No this is a Saturday night

ABI
(to the kids) OK stick between
me and Dad and don’t make eye-
contact with anyone

They compress into a protective huddle and start to move out

(Joining in the guessing game) Is
it a giant rabbit head A giant
rabbit head with the bottom half
chopped off Is it a joke cushion
that stabs you in the bottom Is it
a DVD in a really funny box

ABI and JESS join in with some guesses The family are having
a good time Suddenly they hear a familiar voice

GORDIE
Is it a cow pie

They all greet GORDIE as he comes bounding in At first
glance he seems fit and energetic but we sense he is
putting on an act Everyone tries to say hello at once

DOUG

She gives him a hand-drawn card he responds with a big hug
There’s a special relationship between them

GORDIE

EXT TRACK WITH A SPECTACULAR VIEW OF THE COAST 82

The pick-up is bumping along with GORDIE driving and JESS in
the back seat of the cab making banshee noises on every
bounce MICKEY has his head out of the window like a dog
They are townie kids who have got the wind in their hair and
are off the leash

However LOTTIE - who is sitting next to GORDIE - is looking a
little constrained - like she dare not quite cut loose She
picks up GORDIE’S mobile

LOTTIE
Grandad your mobile’s turned off

GORDIE
Aye that’s the way I like it

GORDIE stops the pick-up and takes in the view

The pick-up jerks the last bit down to the beach Cut wide to
see the huge empty beach The pick-up stops and the doors
open The children run yelling out onto the wide expanse of
sand Even LOTTIE has lost all her worries

GORDIE gets out gingerly short of strength and short of
breath But he smiles at the excited kids doing what
children should be doing

83 EXT BEACH - DAY 83

MICKEY carries armfuls of firewood down the beach from the
heaps of flotsam and jetsam at the tide line The pick-up is
visible up at the edge of the dunes GORDIE sits in an old
deck chair

MICKEY
And is it nice being a lesbian
GORDIE
What the hell are you asking me

MICKEY

I suppose it must be otherwise
they wouldnt do it

GORDIE chuckles and shakes his head This kid tickles him

MICKEY (CONTD)

they just find out Eventually we
all find out what we are

By now theyve arrived at the beginnings of a fire theyre
making on the beach LOTTIE is lobbing on some sticks In the
middle of it is the broken ‘No Fires On The Beach sign

Thats an old Viking burial mound

He runs off towards it

GORDIE MICKEY and JESS are gathered around a reasonably
impressive pile of firewood

LOTTIE stands next to a big boulder above the tide line

GORDIE
Is what official

LOTTIE can just read it

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY

LOTTIE
‘Keep off Frazer and Gordie’s

GORDIE
Oh God I carved that well I

LOTTIE
Who’s Frazer

GORDIE takes a breath hes got to explain this
GORDIE
Frazer was my big brother died in
the war
MICKEY

In Afghanistan

GORDIE
No he was fighting a very stupid
man called Hitler who wanted to
take everyone else’s land

MICKEY
Like in Monopoly

GORDIE
Yes just like Monopoly Only with
more screaming Anyway before the
war when I was your age Mickey
Frazer would bring me here and show
me how to catch crabs and he
taught me how to swim

LOTTIE
How did he die

GORDIE hesitates for a moment

GORDIE
Someone made a mistake A pilot

He claps his hands in encouragement and the kids charge off
to look for wood

EXT BEACH - LATER 85

GORDIE and the CHILDREN are gathered around a good blazing
fire MICKEY is running around whooping like a small deranged
arsonist

MICKEY
(Picking up the spade) Can we bury

GORDIE
Oh no that sand gets everywhere I
definitely dont want to be buried
thank you

JESS
What not even when you die

LOTTIE
Je-ss

JESS
(To LOTTIE) Well thats what
happens when someone dies you bury
them and then everyone goes and
eats cakes That’s right isn’t it
Grandad

GORDIE
(Amused) Aye that’s right
sweetheart And then all the
arguing starts I’ve never seen the
point of funerals

Lots of people standing in the kirk
while some priest tells some pack
of lies about what a great man you
were I tell you just put me out

Grandads (LOTTIE looks shocked)
Oh for God’s sake it’s a joke (He
puts his arm around her)

JESS has wandered off during this speech

MICKEY grabs a bucket and he and JESS sprint towards the

water

MICKEY
On telly they had this rocky
country where they leave bodies out
to be eaten by vultures

GORDIE
Thatd be perfect or if I have to
have a funeral just give me a good
old Viking funeral like my
ancestors eh just stick me on a
burning raft and float me out to
sea thats what Id like no
stupid family fights no stupid
rows about who does what Just a
warriors farewell

MICKEY
Do you want me to catch some fish
for us to cook

GORDIE
That’s right and get a few crabs
while youre about it

LOTTIE
There are sandwiches in the pick-
up arent there

GORDIE winks at her

JESS and MICKEY are now nearly at the waters edge

GORDIE
Yes but you cant hunt sandwiches

well as the little ones scream

Im decorating it

MICKEY
You do that later are you OK back

We cut to see that they have indeed buried GORDIE only his
head is visible

GORDIE
Aye Im grand apart from the sand
up my arse

JESS and MICKEY find the notion of sand in Grandads pants
very funny

GORDIE (CONTD)
Oh look look up there it’s the
osprey

We cut to the osprey circling

GORDIE(CONT’D)
Look at that

JESS
(Quietly to MICKEY) Its just a
bird

GORDIE

17 years shes been coming back
She’s flown all the way from
Africa back to where she was born

eh Lottie

JESS
How far is Africa Is it further
than Yarmouth

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 61
86

MICKEY
Africas eight million miles away

JESS MICKEY and LOTTIE start an improv about the point of
migration Why dont animals just stay put It’s about
parents helping their children to survive If you laid an egg
in Africa it would fry Is that why Dad went down to London
to have us During all this GORDIE is watching the osprey
in semi-rapture but then his eyes start to hood Finally
they close JESS LOTTIE and MICKEY continue their
discussion until LOTTIE says

LOTTIE
Thats rubbish isnt it Grandad

He does not reply He is completely still

LOTTIE (CONTD)
Grandad Grandad

The kids look at each other Theyre a little thrown

MICKEY
(Louder)Hey Grandad

Now the kids are troubled

JESS
Perhaps hes asleep

Nervously LOTTIE moves forward closer to GORDIEs face she
reaches out to touch him tentatively on the shoulder

LOTTIE
Grandad

Suddenly GORDIE erupts out of the sand and shouts ‘Boo’
The kids dissolve into screams and laughter Hes really
startled them especially LOTTIE

LOTTIE (CONTD)
Gran-dad That wasnt funny

MICKEY

Well it was quite funny-
LOTTIE

No it-
JESS

It was funnier than monkeys (etc)

EXT GAVIN AND MARGARETS HOUSE - DAY 87

with a printed notice that says ‘flowers here’

EXT BEACH - DAY 88

The little ones are playing in the rock pools on the south
side of the beach LOTTIE is still with her Grandad She is
drawing in the sand with a stick as GORDIE tries to reassure
her

LOTTIE
Mum and Dad lie so much I just
don’t trust them I feel so angry
with them all the time

GORDIE
I used to feel like that about my
lot But then I realised theres no
point being angry with people you
love for being what they are So
what if your Dad is a complete and
utter bloody shambles and what if
your Uncle Gavin is a bit of a
tight-arse all that social
climbing he cant help himself
just as his wife cant help being
frightened of her own shadow and
your Mum cant help being a bit
mouthy the truth is every human
being on this planet is ridiculous
in their own way so we shouldn’t
judge and we shouldnt fight
because in the end (He shakes his
head and chuckles to himself) In
the end none of it matters none
of that stuff

LOTTIE smiles at him shes understood (sort of) They hear
JESS shouting from the waterline

JESS
Lottie this shell’s got legs What
do I do

LOTTIE

It’s OK it’ll be a hermit crab

GORDIE watches as LOTTIE runs off to help JESS explaining
about hermit crabs as she goes MICKEY is now kicking a ball
around by the waterline Because GORDIE is looking into the
sun the children are now just silhouettes outlined against a
shimmering sea like the perfect tableau of carefree
childhood The silhouette of MICKEY turns and starts to run
towards GORDIE GORDIE shields his eyes against the sun and
as MICKEYs silhouette walks towards him it resolves into a
15-year-old boy dressed in 1940s clothes carrying an old-
fashioned leather-and-lace football

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 63

GORDIE is delighted if a bit puzzled to see him

GORDIE
Frazer What are you doing here

The image of his brother smiles

GORDIE (CONTD)
Oh I get it

FRAZER
Are you coming in for a swim you
big Mary

FRAZER turns and runs back towards the sea

He slowly disappears as he walks into the huge sun of
GORDIEs imagination

Down by the waterline LOTTIE and JESS are wildly splashing
each other MICKEY comes running along the beach
triumphantly holding a wriggling crab in the air

MICKEY
(Shouting) Hey Grandad can we
cook this Or would that be unfair
on the beach I dont mind putting
it back if

MICKEY dribbles to a halt His Grandad is lying still

MICKEY (CONTD)
Hey Im not falling for that
again Grandad stop mucking about

MICKEY has a bright idea He creeps forward and craftily puts
his live crab on GORDIEs chest Then he steps back waiting
for GORDIE to react But nothing happens The crab tumbles
off GORDIEs chest on to the sand Now MICKEY starts to
worry

MICKEY (CONTD)

(Calls) Lottie Lottie (Shouts)
I think somethings happened to
Grandad

LOTTIE gets up and approaches followed by JESS
LOTTIE
Oh hes just doing his joke again
Come on Grandad were not stupid

GORDIE remains horribly still

JESS
(To the others) Sssh

She creeps up on her GRANDAD and tickles him Nothing LOTTIE
leans forward and shakes him by the shoulder

LOTTIE listens to his chest MICKEY and JESS stand by

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY

LOTTIE
Grandad I think he might be dead

staring now very worried

LOTTIE (CONTD)
He’s not breathing

LOTTIE carries out the reflex test on his foot - running a
biro from toe to heel

MICKEY
(Very serious) This is such bad
luck dying just before your
birthday party

JESS
We’d better get him back alive
again

LOTTIE
That’s the brain function test
Ill check his pulse They showed
us last week at Brownies

The two younger ones discuss how theyre going to bring him
back to life Only LOTTIE is taking in the full gravity of
whats happened

JESS
On Casualty they put things on
their chests and shout Clear

MICKEY
In Lord of the Rings lots of people
come back from being dead but Im
not sure how its something to do
with believing

JESS
What if we put a lobster on his
chest

Suddenly LOTTIE shouts at them angrily

She gives

LOTTIE
Stop being stupid and going on
about stupid lobsters (JESS

looks really upset) Sorry sorry
Jess I didnt meant to shout

JESS a hug

LOTTIE (CONTD)
But Grandad’s got no pulse so wed
better go back and tell everyone

MICKEY
Well theyll just argue and fight
(This stops LOTTIE in her tracks)
Grandad said And he said he didnt
want that

LOTTIE turns very pensive she starts to worry

JESS
But if we leave him then crows and
seals and puffins and badgers and
things might eat him and itd be a
bit horrible

MICKEY
You go back Lottie Well stay and
guard Grandad

LOTTIE
Are you sure youll be OK with

brave and grown-up of you

MICKEY
Ill get a stick in case we have to

LOTTIE
Yes

JESS

She points to a plastic bag containing swiss rolls

LOTTIE
(Distracted) I think itd be
alright

MICKEY
We wont eat Grandads just in
case

LOTTIE sets off running towards the dunes

through the dunes

runs off along it

Suddenly she trips and falls over as she gathers herself she
sees a mouses nest tucked away in the heather full of v
small baby mice

She picks herself up a bit battered and sets off again

EXT BEACH - DAY 92
MICKEY and JESS are still on guard

JESS
In that film about the man who
fought the other man when the
other man died they covered his
face

MICKEY gently covers his Grandads face with a jumper

MICKEY
There was a thing in a newspaper
that said when people had stopped
breathing cos theyd just died
they felt themselves leave their
bodies and then they found they
were sort of hovering above their
bodies looking down at themselves
and watching everything that
everyone was doing

They think about this for a moment Then slowly
apprehensively they both look upwards

EXT GAVIN AND MARGARET’S HOUSE - DAY 93

say something but the speed of their argument prevents her

DOUG
You should just give him what he
wants

GAVIN

(V loud now) Hes very ill he
doesnt know what he wants we have
to make decisions for him but you
wouldnt know about that because
youre never here

They have reached the spot for the table And GAVIN walks
away to fetch some chairs

DOUG
Oh f£-

GAVIN
This is going to be a reasonable-
sized gathering to celebrate Dads
life

DOUG shouts after him

DOUG

LOTTIE frowns at another secret

DOUG
That you’re dating a plastic man
with no genitalia

ABI

They start shouting over each other

LOTTIE has been watching all this Her mind is made up She
runs off as their argument intensifies She dashes round the
back of the house to GORDIE’s room and climbs in the window

start collecting up some belongings when she hears feet
coming down the stairs She has to hide somewhere fast

MARGARET bustles in It doesnt look as if theres anyone in
the room She heads across the room looking for something

The camera stays on the empty room just long enough to
register that there is a small pair of legs standing in the

head up the chimney

determined

EXT BEACH - DAY

The fire has gone down MICKEY and JESS seem a little
bewildered as they stand guard over GORDIE’S body JESS is
repeating an idea that MICKEY has told her

JESS
So it’s not really Grandad any
more he’s left and that’s just
the outside of him

The thought is interrupted by LOTTIE running across the
dunes past the pick-up Shes carrying a plastic bag

MICKEY
She ate Grandads swiss roll
JESS
I didnt mean to It was an
accident
MICKEY

It wasnt an accident

LOTTIE
It doesnt matter

JESS
Where are the grown-ups

LOTTIE
Fighting Mickey was right They
cant be trusted to do what Grandad
wants so well do it Well give
him the funeral he asked for

MICKEY
A Viking one

LOTTIE
Yes

MICKEY
Cool

JESS

(Checking) So were going to put
him on a Viking boat and then send
him out into the sea

LOTTIE
yes

JESS
wand then set fire to him

LOTTIE
Yes its what he said he wanted

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 70
95

JESS
Where will we find a Viking boat

MICKEY
Theyve got one in York Though Im
not sure the Museum will lend it to
us if we tell them were going to
burn it

LOTTIE
Right now listen we all have to
work together this is our present
to Grandad saying goodbye his
way

They all turn very serious for a few moments

MICKEY
(Picking up the box) Shotgun the
matches
EXT BEACH - DAY 96

We look at a massive wide shot The children are up in the
sand-dunes tugging at a big wooden pallet which is half-
buried in some sand They heave it out Cut to them joining
two pallets together by pushing fence posts through the
hollow space in the middle They stuff empty plastic water
bottles in the gaps between the posts

MICKEY
So it wont be a proper Viking
Longboat

LOTTIE
No itll be a raft but I expect
the Vikings had rafts didnt they

MICKEY the Viking expert considers then agrees The only
problem is that now when they try they can’t shift the
pallets

They discuss ways they could move it

JESS suggests they could use their brain waves like the man
on TV

MICKEY says if they had helium filled balloons that would
make it lighter

LOTTIE wonders if they could take the wheels off Grandads
pick up and put them on the pallet

Finally JESS says
JESS

Why dont we put it in Grandads
car

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 71
96

LOTTIE
We cant drive

JESS
Yes we can

A beat Then hard CUT TO

INTEXT PICK-UPBEACH - DAY 97

The children are in the front seats The engine is running
The car is an automatic

LOTTIE grabs hold of the wheel but her feet wont touch the
ground

LOTTIE
Mickey you push the pedal and Ill
do the wheel

MICKEY is stretched head-first under the dashboard He pushes
down on the accelerator The engine roars but doesnt go
anywhere as it is not in gear MICKEY points at the gear
lever and hand brake

MICKEY
You have to do something with
those

MICKEY and LOTTIE push and pull at the handbrake until it is
released The pick-up rolls forward a yard and they think
they are driving but then it stops

MICKEY (CONTD)
Ill do this (the gear stick)
Which one should I do One two
three four or R

LOTTIE
‘One’ cos thats first

JESS
I think you should do R cos we want
the car to go rrrrrr

MICKEY considers

MICKEY
Im going to do ‘One’ (He
hesitates) Are we going to get in
trouble for all this Like when I
started the lawnmower indoors

LOTTIE
I think the grown-ups might be
annoyed at first but once we
explain it’s what Grandad wanted
theyll be fine with it

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 72
97

The pick-up is making some horrible noises but MICKEY gets
it into gear one

JESS
The car sounds a bit annoyed

LOTTIE
Do the pedal again

MICKEY pushes the accelerator and the pick-up lurches
forward They all cheer as it bounces along the beach JESS
reaches for what she thinks is the indicator

JESS
Do I do left or right

LOTTIE
Er right

She turns right toward the pallets JESS pulls and pushes at
the levers The windscreen is squirted with soap and the
wipers come on at their fastest speed

LOTTIE (CONTD)
No

LOTTIE shouts at MICKEY for more or less power until they
triumphantly pull up in front of the pallet They are all
very pleased with themselves until a thought occurs to
MICKEY

MICKEY
How we going to get that on to the
back

LOTTIEs face tells us that she hadnt thought of this

CUT TO

EXT BEACH - DAY 98

We start on a big CU of a tangled forest of knots that
suddenly tightens The CHILDREN have used some brightly
coloured blue green and red nautical nylon cord washed up
on the beach to tie the big pallet to the back of the pick-up
and are driving to the sea dragging the pallet behind them

MICKEY
(Looking backwards out of the
window) That’s every knot I know

LOTTIE
Grandad said the tide is coming in
so if we leave it at the edge of
the sea

LOTTIE drives the pick-up right down to the sea turning so
the truck is parallel to the waterline

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 73
98

LOTTIE (CONTD)
Jess say when it’s at the edge

To get the pallet near to the sea LOTTIE has to drive the
pick-up nearly into the water

JESS
Edge

They start to get out

MICKEY

Do you think we need to lock it
LOTTIE

Yes we dont want it getting

stolen

But as MICKEY jumps down the matches in his pocket fall into
a puddle of water

LOTTIE (CONTD)
Mickey you idiot

MICKEY
(Fishing out the soggy match box)
That was an accident

LOTTIE
Yes but-

MICKEY
A real accident not like her swiss
roll-eating accident

LOTTIE
Alright alright but how are we
going to light the-

Suddenly JESS yells

JESS
Look

A couple of crows andor seagulls are hopping ominously
towards GORDIEs body All three of them run at the birds
shouting to drive them off

EXT BEACH - DAY 99

The tide has come in and the pick-up is now closer to the
water

MICKEY is concentrating hard twisting a small bit of wood
into a big bit of wood in an attempt to make fire

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 74
99

MICKEY
‘Course for it to be a proper
Viking funeral its crucial that
he gets to take his favourite
things to Heaven

LOTTIE looks pleased with herself and empties out the plastic
bag she brought back from the house The contents include
GORDIEs Viking brooch and his Scotland jersey

Suddenly GORDIEs corpse lets rip with a very loud fart

LOTTIE
Grandad

MICKEY
Hes alive

They leap across to the corpse shouting excitedly trying to
revive him They take the jumper off his face LOTTIE gently
slaps his cheeks

LOTTIEMICKEYJESS
Grandad come onwake upcan you
hear us (etc)

LOTTIE
(Realizing) He’s cold

The other two understand that hes definitely dead JESS
wanders disconsolately off and starts playing with some
stones

MICKEY
wl think you can do farts after
youre dead I saw it on
(Remembers) The Real Silent
Witness This woman said so

LOTTIE
«are you sure

MICKEY
She was wearing a white coat she
said dead people are full of gas so
they make noises they can fart and
burp and whistle (thinks) actually
Im not sure about whistle

The disappointment seems to have knocked all the air out of
MICKEY He sits on the sand staring at the corpse

MICKEY (CONTD)
I’m a bit scared

LOTTIE
(Putting her arm around him) Its
OK Mickey its just Grandad

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 75
99

LOTTIE places the jumper back over GORDIE’s face then puts
her arm around MICKEY’s shoulders

LOTTIE (CONTD)
He sort of died in battle cos he
was fighting cancer so well give
him a warriors funeral

She is interrupted by the barking of a dog The children look
up A WOMAN is walking an unruly black Labrador along the
beach

MICKEY
What are we going to tell her

JESS (EMPHATIC)
The truth

LOTTIE
No Jess then all the adults will
get involved (Remembering her
Grandad’s words) Sometimes it’s OK
to lie

The WOMAN has been preoccupied with managing her dog but now
she has spotted the rather peculiar scene on the beach Shes
about thirty five yards away

WOMAN
(Calls) Are you alright down there

LOTTIE
(Calls) Yes were fine thank you

The dog starts bounding towards them

WOMAN
Hero Hero Come back

She points at the pick-up which is up to its hubcaps in the
water

WOMAN (CONTD)
How did that get there

JESS
It drove there

LOTTIE shoots JESS a look that says be quiet

LOTTIE
Were just waiting for some grown-
ups to come back

The dog is now approaching Grandad MICKEY tries to quietly
shoo it away but its sniffing around him The WOMAN is now
more perplexed She starts to approach
SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 76
99 99

WOMAN
Is is he alright Hero heel

She approaches some more so LOTTIE approaches her to try
and keep her away from the body

LOTTIE
Oh yes thats Grandad hes just
having a nap

The WOMAN moves forward again but is stopped dead in her
tracks when Grandad lets rip with an even more enormous fart
Even the dog recoils

WOMAN
(To herself) Well really

MICKEY and JESS start to get the giggles LOTTIE shoots them
a look

LOTTIE
(To the WOMAN) Sorry about that
he does that sometimes

The little ones start giggling even more and for a moment
LOTTIE thinks theyre about to be rumbled when suddenly the
dog chases off after some gulls barking like crazy

WOMAN
He-ro No (To LOTTIE) So you
say some grown-ups are coming -
oh no hes got one He-ro No
Drop

She scuttles off to control the dog LOTTIE watches her go
for a moment thinking

LOTTIE
Mickey Is it important that we set
fire to Grandads boat

MICKEY
Yes otherwise his soul’s not let
free

LOTTIE has spotted the WOMAN lighting a cigarette She runs
after her

LOTTIE
Excuse me Excuse me could I
borrow your matches

WOMAN
My matches

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 77
99

LOTTIE
Yes um Grandads addicted to
cigarettes but he dropped his
matches in the sea (The WOMAN
seems undecided) and cigarettes
are his only pleasure in life

The WOMAN is amused by this She hands LOTTIE the box
WOMAN

Alright sweetie just one left
Im afraid Dont you start smoking

now

LOTTIE
I wont (Turns and runs off)
Thank you

The WOMAN carries on up the beach shouting after her
uncontrollable dog

EXT BEACH - DAY 100

The pick-up is a bit deeper in the water The raft is
finished complete with GORDIEs brooch and jersey laid on
top of a pile of kindling MICKEY starts pouring petrol from
a can all over the raft till LOTTIE takes it off him A deer
skull plus antlers has been tied to the front There is even
a sail made from GORDIE’s old deck chair flapping in the
wind

The children have placed a row of round fence posts on the
ground and LOTTIE and MICKEY are rolling GORDIEs body over
them (body double) JESS is hanging back a little nervously

LOTTIE
I didn’t think this would work

MICKEY
Well it worked at Stonehenge And
those Druids were moving huge
rocks not Grandads so well done
my brain Whoa

They stop as Mickey takes a fence post from behind and places
it in front They roll him some more

MICKEY (CONTD)

I am so looking forward to when we
go back to school and we have to
write What I did at Half Term
(They keep rolling) Though I bet
Shania has done something more
interesting cos she always has

SHOOTING SCRIPT - 20 MAY 78

EXT BEACH - DAY 101

The pick-up is now much deeper in the water and the raft is
nearly afloat The CHILDREN stand in the shallows with an air
of solemnity They have taken the jumper off their Grandad’s
face MICKEY puts his toy sword in GORDIE’s hand

JESS gets her favourite pebble out of her pocket and places
it on the raft beside him

LOTTIE
(Clears her throat bows her head)
We are gathered here this
Saturday to remember GORDIE
MCLEOD I’m sorry you died Grandad
I liked having someone to talk to
Amen

MICKEY mutters ‘Amen’ and JESS copies

JESS
Goodbye (stumped) you were nice

MICKEY
Have a good Valhalla

LOTTIE hands MICKEY the box of matches MICKEY opens the box
Suddenly the enormity of it hits him

MICKEY (CONTD)
What if I mess it up

LOTTIE steps up to the plate Nervously she takes the match
She takes a deep breath steps forward towards the raft
Suddenly the wind picks up and the deck-chair billows The
raft starts to drift out After a couple of attempts LOTTIE
manages to strike the match and then lobs it onto the
kindling around the edge of the raft The raft goes up with a
big whoof The kids have to back away and walk back up the
beach a bit

LOTTIE puts her arm round JESS who turns her back to the
sea The kindling on the raft is burning well now but the
flames have not reached the body The wind is blowing the
raft away from the beach

MICKEY (CONTD)
I wish he could see this

LOTTIE
Yeh hed be really proud of us

JESS glances back over her shoulder to look
JESS

Is it too late to get my pebble
back

tiny thing that happened leading up to the death much to
ABIs frustration

This all happens in the background of the following scene
Meanwhile DOUG has homed in on LOTTIE and MICKEY

DOUG
(Trying to stay calm) Listen kids

LOTTIE

the truth

KENNETH comes in through the front door unaware of the

KENNETH
Grandad’s not in his room and the
pick-up’s not there

He picks up some parking signs and exits

GAVIN

end of the phone) Yes yes we do

Then stops for a moment as if it is over before MARGARET
suddenly starts grabbing tins bags of flour boxes of eggs
etc hurling them at the shopper who covers beneath the
bombardment But GAVIN notices none of this he continues to
upbraid the Policemen

Here it is How about I make a
formal complaint to your Chief
Superintendent who happens to be a
friend of mine

Behind PC MCLUHAN’s shoulder we can see MARGARET’s rage is
escalating still further

who happens to be in my house now
as a guest So

He stops in his tracks His eye-line drifts to the left Then
he shifts his head to the side His eyes widen as we see what
he is seeing behind the POLICEMAN on the TV screen where
MARGARET is still pelting the shopper with a barrage of
missiles Suddenly she stops and runs out of frame She
returns a moment later carrying a huge pumpkin which she
hurls at the shopper knocking her over Supermarket staff

of the kitchen hatch and shapes to leave LOTTIE sees her and
AGNES smiles for the first time then leaves

LOTTIE
Are you permitted to tell me will
everything turn out fine

KENNETH breezes into this tableau of togetherness in a happy
mood after his phone call Again he is confronted by a very
odd-looking scene

KENNETH
Oh Has something else happened

EXT BEACH - DUSK - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER 157

A party is in progress There is lots of drink a bonfire
music and a relaxed festive atmosphere A group of family and
friends including DOREEN and JIMMY are having a wake on the
beach where GORDIE died The abandoned pick-up truck is
there

ABI has her arms around MICKEY and is showing some concern
about him We see all this from MICKEY’s POV slightly
blurred as if through a fever

ABI
He’s really burning up And I
calpoled him half an hour ago

MARGARET
Perhaps we’d best run him back up
to the house

MICKEY
(Adamant) No I’m fine I want to
stay

ABI and MARGARET press him but MICKEY won’t give ground
Nearby JESS is talking to DOREEN

JESS
I’ve learnt my lesson next time
I’m with someone who dies on a
beach I’m going to tell a grown-up
and not set fire to them

DOREEN
Very sensible

MICKEY drifts over to LOTTIE who’s staring at the sunset

DOUG and ABI watch MICKEY and LOTTIE through the flames of
the fire

DOUG
It’s nice Mickey wants to be-

ABI
(Interrupts) I said ‘no’ to the
Newcastle job

This stops DOUG in his tracks
DOUG

Did you Thanks I’ve decided I
don’t need a solicitor

ABI

I know my solicitor told me
DOUG

Already
ABI

She said it gave me a huge
advantage She used the phrase
‘easy meat’

There’s a long beat
ABI (CONTD)
Ill get rid of her We’1l do
this humanely
GAVIN is organizing everyone
GAVIN
OK everybody if you could all

gather round for a moment

MICKEY is holding hands with LOTTIE

MICKEY
(a bit dreamy) Lottie You know
I’m not sure there is any actual
real evidence that the Vikings
actually buried their dead by
burning them and floating them out
to sea

LOTTIE turns slowly to look at him

LOTTIE
Mickey never ever say that out
loud again

GAVIN
(addressing everyone) My brother
Doug is going to say a few words

DOUG starts reaching into his pockets looking for his notes
ABI pulls the notes out of DOUG’S back pocket and hands them
to him

DOUG
(A little stiff and awkward) Thank
you all for coming - and well done
on shaking off the reporters by the
way the press have portrayed my
father’s death as a disgrace But
what better way to die could he
have had on his favourite beach
watching the grandchildren he
loved playing (His voice starts
to crack) in the (His voice
cracks still more)

GAVIN puts his arm around his brother and takes over

GAVIN
I don’t know what Dad would have
made of all of this actually I do
hed have laughed himself stupid
(Some murmurs of recognition) he’d
have laughed at everyone turning up
for his party except for him and
he’d have laughed at the
authorities trying to find the
relevant form to fill in and he’d
certainly have laughed at
Margaret’s starring role on Youtube
(MARGARET laughs) 4 million 458
thousand 207 hits at last count 3
of them mine

GAVIN and MARGARET smile at each other and she takes his
hand They have clearly started to rebuild their
relationship

GAVIN (CONTD)
and me he’d have laughed at me
a lot and my main regret - apart
from not having a bit more time
with Dad - is that he couldn’t see
us all running around like idiots

Everyone’s listening intently apart from MICKEY who is
staring at JIMMY ODIN We see MICKEY’S POV of JIMMY
which is momentarily blurred because of his fever

GAVIN (CONTD)
now I’m sure many of you believe
he can see us but for my part I
think death is it I think life
this life is all you get and
Gordie McLeod had a hell of a life
and so should we because that’s
all death is good for to give us a
kick up the arse and say get on
with it and love those around you

GAVIN (CONTD)
And now my wonderful son Kenneth
will play something

KENNETH gets out his violin and starts to play a classical
requiem

GAVIN (CONTD)
No something he’d like go mental

KENNETH stops and launches into a wild piece of Scottish folk
music In amongst the mourners is the GIRL VIOLINIST She
takes out her fiddle and joins with KENNETH The band are
also there They produce their fiddles and join as well to
produce a big blazing chorus that rises above the wind and
sea

But meanwhile MICKEY is looking towards the burial mound He
watches as a ghostly VIKING emerges from the mound - a big
bearded hairy man carrying a flaming torch OTHER VIKINGS
start to appear

MICKEY smiles For a moment DOUG follows the direction of
his son’s gaze But sees nothing

GAVIN grabs MARGARET and they start to dance a dance as wild
as the music MARGARET beams as he whirls her

KENNETH saws at his violin The sea is lapping around his
feet but he doesn’t notice The primal music mixes with the
wind and the sea

DOREEN leads JIMMY into the dance and others follow
The sunset is now darkening into red and purple and now

MICKEY sees a ring of NORSE WARRIORS on the dunes holding
high their flaming torches

The fires flicker the sea glows red the dancers whirl and
stomp and the music howls

EXT BEACH - DUSK 158

Some of the band are now on the back of the pick-up truck We
cut to the family in silhouette as they run shouting
towards the water Behind them we can hear and see the party
still in full flow

They all run into the waves and then turn around and sprint
back towards the beach screaming and laughing because the
North Atlantic is too cold

For a few moments ABI watches the kids mucking about in the
shallows with their Dad looking relaxed and happy She
raises her voice above the din to make announcement

ABI
Listen kids um me and Dad would
just like to say something (The
KIDS stop playing she’s got their
attention) We um we know that
weve not behaved very well
recently and well we’d just like
to say sorry

DOUG
(Moving closer to ABI) That’s
right

ABI

And while we will be living in
different houses from now on
were going to behave like grown-
ups

The KIDS look pleased with this ABI smiles at DOUG and then
kicks water at him

DOUG
Whoa (He retaliates)

Suddenly a huge water-fight kicks off with the entire
family gleefully trying to soak each other Above the whoops
of delight DOUG calls to LOTTIE pointing at her Mum

DOUG (CONTD)
Did you see that Lottie
Inappropriate behaviour You need
to write that down in your book

LOTTIE
I’ve chucked the book away

ABI
Really

LOTTIE
Yeh I don’t think I need it
anymore

DOUG and ABI share a happy look before they are both mightily
splashed by MICKEY and JESS The water-fight intensifies
amid much joyful laughter and screaming

Something runs through shot Was that an ostrich

THE END
