INT THE MATRIX -— NIGHT 501
Fade in--

On the Matrix at code level where we are traveling with the
speed of thought--

Rushing through streaks of coded light before pausing to
survey an area from above as a god might

We glide down for a slightly closer look at the encoded
metropolis effortlessly moving through the walls and rooms

of a skyscraper until we again accelerate beyond the speed

of light to search--

INT MJOLNIR MAIN DECK — NIGHT 502

As the code forms the familiar drips and we pull out onto the
monitors of the Mjolnir’s operator’s station

AK Link’s counterpart on this ship beats his keyboard
AK
I got nothing sir No sign of Niobe or
Ghost Nothing but blue pills

The crew of the Mjolnir are gathered on the main deck

MAUSER
Should we jack in and try to contact
them

ROLAND
It won’t matter My gut says they’re
down

MAUSER
Then we should start back

ROLAND
No If that ship can still fly we need
it

MAUSER

I was afraid you were going to say that

ROLAND
Search every pipe every hole every
crack we know Sweep as wide as possible
as fast as possible

AK
Captain these lines are crawling with
calamari

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002

ROLAND
Then the sooner we find them the better

INT MJOLNIR - INFIRMARY NIGHT
Neo lies unconscious Trinity is at his bedside

The door opens and Maggie the ship’s medic enters with a
small plate of food

MAGGIE
Thought you could use something to eat

TRINITY
Thank you

Trinity takes the plate from her

MAGGIE
Any change

She shakes her head

Maggie starts to check Neo’s monitors when Bane groans She
steps over to his bed which is a reverse of Neo’s position

TRINITY
How is he

MAGGIE
He’s going to be fine At least until he
wakes up

TRINITY
What do you mean

MAGGIE
The Captain has some questions for him
and he better have some good answers
Bane becomes silent and still

MAGGIE (CONTD)
You see these cuts on his body

Trinity nods

MAGGIE (CONTD)
I think they’re self inflicted

TRINITY
Why

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002

MAGGIE
VDT’s maybe I don’t know But like I
said the answer better be good

504 INT MJOLNIR MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Morpheus and Link have remained at the perimeter of the
meeting Now Morpheus steps out of the shadows

MORPHEUS
Roland

ROLAND
Yeah

MORPHEUS

I would like to run one more search
through the Matrix

ROLAND
For what

MORPHEUS
For Neo

AK

How could he be in the Matrix sir He’s
not plugged in

MORPHEUS
Please for me

505 INT MJOLNIR - INFIRMARY - NIGHT
Maggie rereads Neo’s life monitors

MAGGIE
This is what keeps bothering me

Trinity rises to see the display

TRINITY
What

MAGGIE
His neural patterns don’t read like
someone who’s in a coma The strange
thing is that I see these patterns all
the time

TRINITY

MAGGIE
On someone jacked in

INT MJOLNIR - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The Matrix drips down the window of the monitor
AK
The big bubkis Nada sir He ain’t in
there
Morpheus stares at the monitor not willing to accept it

Colt slides down the ladder from the cockpit

COLT

Sir I’ve got the projections
ROLAND

How long
COLT

Based on point of entry and their past
speed it looks like the Machines will
reach Zion in just under twenty hours

AK
Jesus H Christ

ROLAND
All right Let’s move with a purpose AK
get upstairs I want you on holographic

AK
Yes sir

He pulls off his headset jumping free of his operator’s
station

ROLAND
Mauser I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times

Suddenly Link notices something

LINK
Hey

ROLAND
Make sure were running on as few pads as
possible

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 5

LINK
Hey Hey

Everyone stops and looks

LINK (CONTD)
You got a call

ROLAND
What

Link jumps into the seat throwing on the headsets

LINK
Operator

SERAPH (VO)
This is Seraph I must speak to Morpheus

Link hands Morpheus the headset

LINK
It’s Seraph He wants to talk to you

EXT CHINATOWN - PHONE BOOTH — NIGHT 507
Seraph is in a phone booth
SERAPH

I bring word from the Oracle She knows

what has happened to Neo You must come

at once
INT MOBIL AVE STATION NIGHT 508
Neo slowly painfully wakes up
His face is mashed against a grey concrete slab Every part
of him hurts A hot-wire migraine sears through both
hemispheres of his brain

He peels open his eyes and sees a tiny pair of shoes

Into the glare of fluorescent light he looks up at a
beautiful little Indian girl

She smiles at him

INDIAN GIRL
Good morning
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 6

508 508
r For a moment he sees her as a program of pure radiant energy
Bathed in the shimmering aura of her light he feels his pain

melting away

NEO (CONTD)
This isn’t the Matrix

SATI
Thats where the train goes That’s where
we’re going But you can’t go with us

NEO
Why not

SATI
He won’t let you

NEO
Who wont

SATI
The Trainman I don’t like him But Papa
says we have to do what the Trainman says
or else he’ll leave us here

She whispers as if afraid the Trainman was listening

SATI (CONTD)
Forever and ever

INT ORACLE’S BUILDING - TENEMENT HALL NIGHT 509

Seraph leads Morpheus and Trinity into the Oracle’s old
apartment

INT ORACLE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM NIGHT 510-

Morpheus and Trinity enter the old apartment An Older Woman
sits alone in the church-like silence

WOMAN
Morpheus Trinity Thank you for coming

They look at one another unable to recognize this woman
The Older Woman sighs

WOMAN (CONTD)
One thing I’ve learned in all my years is
that nothing ever works out just the way
you want it to

TRINITY
Who are you

WOMAN
I’m the Oracle

Neither believes it

ORACLE
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this but there ain’t I’m sorry
this had to happen I’m sorry I couldnt
be sitting here like you remember me
But it wasn’t meant to be

TRINITY
What happened
ORACLE
I made a choice and that choice cost me

more than I wanted it to

MORPHEUS
What choice
f

a

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002

ORACLE
To help you To guide Neo Now since
the real test for any choice is having to
make the same choice again knowing full
well what it might cost I guess I feel
pretty good about that choice ‘cause here
Iam at it again

TRINITY
You know what happened to Neo

ORACLE
Yes He is trapped in a place between
this world and the Machine World There
are links that have been constructed like
islands used for trafficking
information Somehow Neo washed up onto
one of them The only way to rejoin his
mind and body is to bring him back out
through this world

TA

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002

TRINITY
How

ORACLE
It wont be easy The link is controlled
by a program called the Trainman He uses
it to smuggle programs in and out of the
Matrix If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him then I’m afraid
our choices are going to become
difficult

TRINITY
Why

ORACLE
Because of who the Trainman works for

MORPHEUS
The Merovingian

ORACLE
He has placed a bounty on your lives You
must be careful at all times Seraph
knows how to find the Trainman He’ll go
with you For years he has protected me
I hope he can do the same for you

SERAPH
Please follow me

Morpheus remains unsure unable to step neither forward or

MORPHEUS
Oracle

ORACLE
I know Morpheus I can see you are
filled with doubt clouded by
uncertainty

MORPHEUS
After all that has happened how can you
expect me to believe you

ORACLE
Iodon’t I expect just what I’ve always
expected For you to make up your own
damn mind Believe me or don’t

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27

All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble and he needs your help

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 9

She turns to Trinity
ORACLE (CONTD)
He needs all our help
INT MOBIL AVE STATION - NIGHT 511

Neo sits rubbing his temples trying to piece together what
happened

SATI
Are you from the Matrix
NEO
Yes no I mean I was
SATI
Why did you leave
NEO
I had to
SATI
I had to leave my home too
MAN
Sati Come here Leave the poor man in
peace
SATI
Yes Papa

She runs to a middle-aged Indian man who is sitting on a
bench beside his beautiful wife Several suitcases stand in a
line next to the bench

MAN
I am sorry She is still very curious

Neo recognizes the man

NEO
I know you

He smiles

NEO
It’s okay I don’t have an answer I
don’t even know where “here” is

RAMA
This place is nowhere It is between your
world and our world

NEO
How do you get out of here

RAMA
There is only one way The train

NEO
Who is the Trainman

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 11

RAMA
He works for the Frenchman

NEO
Why did I know you were going to say
that

RAMA

The Frenchman does not forget and he does
not forgive

NEO
You know him

RAMA
I know only what I need to know I know
that if you want to take something from
our world into your world that does not
belong there you must go to the
Frenchman

NEO
Is that what you are doing here

KAMALA
Rama please

RAMA
I do not want to be cruel Kamala He may
never see another face for the rest of
his life

NEO
I’m sorry You don’t have to answer that

RAMA
No I don’t mind The answer is simple

He lays his hand on Sati’s head

RAMA (CONTD)
I love my daughter very much I find her
to be the most beautiful thing I have
ever seen But where we are from that is
not enough Every program that is created
must have a purpose If it does not it
is deleted

Kamala looks away
RAMA (CONTD)

I went to the Frenchman to save my
daughter

Neo struggles with the idea of a Machine loving another
‘ Machine

RAMA (CONTD)
You do not understand

NEO
I just have never

RAMA
Heard a program speak of love

NEO
3 Tt is a human emotion

RAMA
No it is a word What matters is the
connection the word implies

He reads Neo’s code

RAMA (CONTD)
I see that you are in love

Neo feels awkwardly exposed

Ne eee

RAMA (CONTD)
Can you tell me what you would give to
hold on to that connection

NEO
» anything

Rama smiles

RAMA
Then perhaps the reason you are here is
not so different than the reason I am
here

512 INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT 512
A wild-eyed derelict sits in the front car of a subway train

The train clatters and screeches down the urban throat where
fluorescent lights hang like broken teeth glowing against
the darkness It is late at night and the train is virtually
empty

The rear door is shoved open with a sudden rush of wind and
noise The derelict turns and sees Seraph leading Morpheus
and Trinity into the car

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 13

The wild eyes widen

SERAPH
Thats him

The Trainman leaps up the burnished blue metal of a 38
special flashing free from his layers of clothes

TRAINMAN
Get away Get away from me

The few passengers react while Seraph continues calmly
toward him

SERAPH
Please We don’t want trouble

TRAINMAN
Get away the hell away from me

SERAPH
We need your help

TRAINMAN
I can’t help you No one can help you

The train passes through a station and the Trainman yanks the
emergency lever--

Throwing the train into a lurching stop

He dives out the open door Seraph Morpheus and Trinity
lunge after him

INT SUBWAY STATION ONE — PLATFORM A — NIGHT Sle

Like a panicked antelope that breaks from the pack
directionless bolting with a kind of awkward grace-

INT SUBWAY STATION ONE PASSENGER TUNNELS - NIGHT 51

He bounds up the stairwell and zig-zags through the mostly
deserted tunnels that lead up to inter-connecting stations

Checking a wrist full of watches he veers off towards
another staircase Almost flying he hurls himself down the
stairs to the train platform below

INT SUBWAY STATION ONE - PLATFORM B NIGHT 51

He turns and fires at the three pursuing figures

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 14

Weaving behind the steel and concrete columns he continues
to fire forcing them to take cover until--

The station begins to rumble and the Trainman smiles

He whirls out from his column firing emptying the gun
waiting for the train to blast into the station

Seraph sees the train that is not going to stop and realizes
what the Trainman is about to do

SERAPH
Oh no

He spins out into the line of fire bullets burying in
pillars with plumes of concrete colored dust

The Trainman turns sprinting towards the train tracks and
jumps For a flashing instant a perfect silhouette in the
blaring train-light his wild clothes like the broken wings
of a bat as--

He leaps from one platform to another disappearing behind the
rushing train

And when it finally passes he is gone leaving the three
alone in the silence that slowly swallows the dopplering
train

MORPHEUS
Damnit

INT MOBIL AVE STATION -— NIGHT 516
Rama is looking at his watch

NEO
When is the train due

RAMA
It is already late It is not like the
Trainman to be late

He eyes Neo for a moment

NEO
You think it has something to do with me

RAMA
I can not say Who knows such things
Only the Oracle
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 15

NEO
You know the Oracle

RAMA
Everyone knows the Oracle I consulted
with her before I met with the Frenchman
She promised she would look after Sati
after we said goodbye

NEO
Goodbye Youre not staying with her

RAMA
It is not possible Our arrangement with
the Frenchman was for our daughter only
My wife and I must return to our world

NEO
why

RAMA
That is our karma

NEO
You believe in karma

RAMA
Karma is a word like love A way of
saying what I am here to do

He looks at his daughter
RAMA (CONTD)
I do not resent my karma I am grateful
for it Grateful for my wonderful wife

For my beautiful daughter They are gifts
and so I do what I must do to honor them

The station begins to rumble

SATI
Papa the train

RAMA
Yes Find your bag Quickly

NEO
Can I carry that for you

Rama pauses

RAMA
All right

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 16

He hands Neo one of the bags

The train is only one car long It screams to a stop and the
doors clamber open

The Trainman steps out

TRAINMAN
Hurry it up I’m late

They start to get on board but suddeniy the Trainman grabs
Neo

TRAINMAN (CONTD)
Who are you

RAMA
He is a friend

KAMALA
Rama

TRAINMAN
Waitwait I know you

His eyes widen

TRAINMAN (CONTD)
That’s why they were--

His smile is yellow and crooked

NEO
I need to get back

He starts to laugh

NEO (CONTD)
Ill pay whatever you want

The joke gets better

NEO (CONTD)
One way or another I’m getting on this
train

TRAINMAN
Oh no no no You’re going to stay right
here until the Merovingian says different
and if I know him youre going to be
here for a long long time

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 17

NEO
I don’t want to hurt you

The curl of his lips is more like a scythe than a smile
TRAINMAN
You don’t get it I built this place
Down here I make the rules Down here I
make the threats

He hits Neo and sends him flying smashing into the ceramic
and concrete wall

TRAINMAN (CONTD)
Down here I’m God

He scowls at Rama and his family
TRAINMAN (CONTD)
Get on the train or you stay here with
him
Rama drops his eyes and gets on the train

INT LINCOLN - NIGHT 517

Seraph is driving the big Lincoln Trinity stares out the
window alone in the back seat

SERAPH
We should return to the Oracle She will
know what to do

TRINITY
No

Morpheus turns to her

TRINITY (CONTD)
We know what has to be done

Morpheus can see the answer reflected in her eyes

MORPHEUS
The Merovingian

INT MOBIL AVE STATION — NIGHT 5

Cradling his broken ribs Neo jumps down onto the tracks

They disappear into darkness He starts running in the same
direction as the train went

GOLDENRCD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 18

We watch for a moment then pan back to look in the opposite
direction where we see him now running towards us

He stops as he enters the station “Mobil Ave” Ee looks back
the way he came

He runs that way only to end up exactly where he started

NEO
Shit

INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE —- NIGHT £19

A corral of exquisite cars and limousines are parked near a
single metal door The Bzg Bald Mar and two of the lupine
killers from the Merovingian’s gang guard the door

Footsteps begin to ring softly against the tomb--gray concrete
as a shadow moves toward them

BIG MAN
You gotta be kidding

KILLER
Holy shit Its wingless

Seraph Trinity and Morpheus step into the small pool of
light

BIG MAN
I get it You must be ready to die

SERAPA
We need to speak with him

The Big Man yanks back the lever of his machine gun

BIG MAN
Only way you’re getting threugh this door
is over my big dead ass

SERAPH

So be it

Trinity moves and the machine gur erupts breathing fire and
spitting lead as we enter--

Bullet Time We see Trinity weaving -mpossibly from a diving
eroucn into a cartwheel even as every inch of space is
punctured by a storm of mindless missiles

To the eye she is a flash almost a ghost as she spins into
a coil and then launches herself into the air--

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 19

Rising in Bullet Time bullets chasing her in the fanning are
of a ticking second hand until-

A savage kick bounces the huge man against the steel door
back into Trinity who slices him with the precision of a
sushimaster dropping him to the floor

Before the other two can react Seraph and Morpheus attack
leaping out from behind the nearest vehicles--

Catching the killers off balance as they deliver their blows
with lethal fury

It is over quickly three dark heaps laying crumpled in the
pool of white light

Without hesitation Trinity opens the metal door Seraph and
Morpheus follow

INT HEL NIGHT CLUB - UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE - NIGHT 5

A small brick room with only a gated elevator Trinity opens
it and they climb in

INT HEL NIGHT CLUB - ELEVATOR - NIGHT 5

There are only two buttons The lower button is slightly red
with the word “hel” written on it

SERAPH
There are no weapons allowed in the club
At the bottom of this elevator there is a
coat check girl and if we are lucky one
man for checking weapons

TRINITY
And if were unlucky

SERAPH
There will be many men

Ka-chung The elevator stops Trinity slides open the gate
INT HEL NIGHT CLUB COAT CHECK - NIGHT

They are very unlucky Five men turn as the beautiful coat
check girl steps between them

COAT GIRL
May I check your-- Oh my god

GOLDENROD REVISICNS JUNE 27 2062 20

The men turn to look as Seraph grabs the coat check girl
pushing her down behind a counter while every hand grabs the
nearest gun

Morpheus and Trinity charge into the room behind the
cacephony of emptying clips and spray and pray gunfire

Bodies dive spinning flying off the walls passing each
other like planes in a dogfight as--

The entire room is shredded bullets ripping through
everything tearing the wails and furniture apart like
termites chewing wood to dust

INT HEL NIGHT CLU3 - NIGHT 523
It is a dark alternative club filled with both programs and
humans Several people react to the noise which can barely be
heard above the pounding music

INT HEL NIGHT CLUB - COAT CHECK - NIGHT 524

A final blcody exchange and the last of the guards slump to
the ground amidst the falling snow-globe debris

Immediately they arm themselves from the mass of weapons in
the weapons check

INT HEL NIGHT CLUB DANCE FLOORVIP AREA - NIGET 525

They push through the heavy doors like biood-soaked divers
slipping into sharx-filled waters Instantly they are
recognized

Forming a Laager back to back their cuns constantly
shifting from harc stare tc clenched jaw they move into the
crowd that clinches arcund them probing looking fcr an
opening

On a raised platfcrm at the far end of the club the
Merovingian rises from nis seat

MEROVINGIAN
What in the hell

Grabbing the railing he sees the three completely
surrounded trying toe push through the dance floor

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
I den’t believe this--

He begins to laugh
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 21
525 525

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
Hey Hey Hey

The music is killed plunging the catacombed chamber into
silence

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
The prodigal child returns The angel
with no wings Are you here for the
bounty Seraph

He laughs again as the crowd contracts around them

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
Tell me how many bullets are there in
those guns I don’t know but I dont
think you have enough

SERAPH
We only want to talk

The Merovingian glances back at the Trainman surrounded by
the eternally young and beautiful

MEROVINGIAN
Oh yes I am sure you do You have fought
through Hell to do so Yes I’11 tell you
what I will do Put down the guns and I
will promise you safe passage out of
here

Seraph checks with Morpheus and Trinity

SERAPH
All three of us

MEROVINGIAN
Yes yes Of course

Slowly they lower their guns The point of no return passes
as their weapons clatter to the floor

Immediately they are snatched up by the surrounding crowd
who smile now teeth flashing the way a knife does as it is
being sharpened

The Merovingian giggles as they climb the stairs followed bj
the newly armed men and women

The Merovingian picks up his martini

MEROVINGIAN

know Some might think that this is a
very strange coincidence but I do not

He sucks at an olive

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
I am curious though as to how it
actually happened Do you know

TRINITY
No

MEROVINGIAN
No I did not think so but it is always
best to ask

He pops the olive into his mouth chewing it with obvious

relish

He smiles

MORPHEUS
We want to make a deal

MEROVINGIAN
Always straight to business eh Morpheus
Okay So I have something you want To

teeth

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
There are only two of them and I must
have them both

There is a faint smile as he chews

SERAPH
What are they

MEROVINGIAN
The eyes of the Oracle

Seraph doesn’t react while several of the armed goons
chuckle

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
She won’t need them anymore what with
the end of the world and all

He drops the metal toothpick into the empty martini glass
MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
So here you bring them to me in this

glass and I will give you back your
savior

His smile is Mephistophelean as he lifts the glass to Seraph
Seraph doesn’t move

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
Do we have a deal Eh Yes No

The empty glass hovers between them as they stare a
another with the kind of intensity that is only pos
after years of deep felt hatred

TRINITY
I don’t have time for this shit

She attacks every blow breaking some kind of bone

Seraph and Morpheus scramble at the surrounding guards
barely able to stop them from shooting her as--

She cuts a path between her and the Merovingian

Seraph kicks one of the guns spinning up into the air as
dozens of heavily armed men storm up the platform

The gun
until--

Trinity

Jamming

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 24

floats above the frozen chaos of inter-—locked bodies

snatches it out of the air and whirls around--

it against the Merovingian’s head Everyone freezes

guns check-mating every move

TRINITY (CONTD)
You want a deal How about this You give
me Neo or we all die right here right

now

MEROVINGIAN
Interesting deal

He looks at her reading the bio-chemistry in her code

MEROVINGIAN (CONTD)
You are really ready to die for this man

She thumbs back the hammer

TRINITY
Believe it

Persephone stares at her like a junkie about to be given a

fix

PERSEPHONE
She’ll do it If she has to she’ll kill

every one of us

Her eyes flash with the memory of it

PERSEPHONE (CONTD)
She’s in love

MEROVINGIAN
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity

TRINITY
Times up What’s it going to be Merv

INT MOBIL AVE STATION — NIGHT

connect his mind to his body

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 25
526 526

He centers his mind focusing drawing closer and closer
until he begins to feel something--

Something that frightens him

A single image suddenly slashes across his minds eye three
black lines across a brimstone desert His mind rushes
forward following the lines as if following a path as the
entire world begins to rumble

He opens his eyes as the train thunders into the station

When Trinity steps out of the doors he almost can’t believe
it She runs to him throwing her arms around him

NEO (CONTD)
Tell me I’m not dreaming

TRINITY
Does this feel like a dream

She kisses him and he smiles

NEO
No

TRINITY
Then you’re not dreaming

The Oracle goes to the sink to wash her hands

So do you recognize me

Neo reads her code

Yeah that’s how it works Some bits you
lose Some bits you keep I don’t yet
recognize my face in the mirror but I
still love candy

Choice The gift we are forever
unwrapping And you know better than

change our lives Sometimes those
changes are visible Sometimes theyre

you first walked through my door
Jittery as a June Bug And now just
look at you

I told you before no one can see beyond
a choice they don’t understand And I
mean no one

NEO
What choice

ORACLE
It doesn’t matter It’s my choice I have
mine to make same as you have yours

NEO
Does that include what things to tell me
and what not to tell me

ORACLE
Of course not

NEO
Then why didn’t you tell me about the
Architect Why didn’t you tell me about
Zion and the Ones before me Why didn’t
you tell me the truth

Because it wasn’t time for you to know

solved then countered Thats his

find it

In less than twelve hours the Machines
will breach the dock walls In every
simulation we’ve run we’ve seen that
once the Machines are inside the city
the odds of our survival decrease
dramatically

The room is crowded but quiet everyone intently following
the logic of Lock

LOCK (CONTD)
Thus our primary objective must be to
destroy or disable the diggers inside the
dock If we can do that perhaps we can
prevent them from ever reaching the city

He speaks like a coroner describing a cause of death
precise and without emotion

LOCK (CONTD)
If not then the only place we will be
able to mount an effective defense will
be at the entrance of the Temple It is
small enough that it will force them into
a bottleneck allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense

TUCHMAN
Commander what’s to stop the Machines
from tunneling straight into the Temple

It appears to us that the diggers are
targeting the electrical activity of
Zion I don’t think they are even aware
that the Temple exists

He looks out as the lights from the Mjolnir disappear around
the corner of intersecting pipe

He nods

She takes hold of the stick when suddenly the lights in the

TRINITY (CONTD)

Ill check it

INT LOGOS - ENGINEERING ROOM - DAY 574

The hatch slaps open and Trinity climbs down the ladder her
fluorescent torch the only source of light

The room looks like a dozen old basements were crammed into a
crawl-space Trinity searches the fuse boxes that line the
walls and finds a series of disconnected fuses when--

Bane attacks

Her light clatters to the floor as he grabs her from behind
pressing the scalpel against her throat

BANE
I should have known he’d send his bitch
first

TRINITY
Bane

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 58

He digs the blade up under her jawbone forcing her head
back

BANE
No one ever got away from me as many
times as you did Every single time I
thought it was the last every time I was
sure we had you somehow you’d slip
through our fingers I really can’t
express just how aggravating that can be

TRINITY
What are you talking about

BANE
I think I might even enjoy killing you as
much as killing him

At the mention of Neo her eyes fire with the intensity of a
lion guarding its cubs

She grabs the knife hand fighting it with all her strength
as she screams throwing them both backward crashing to the
floor

The two bodies writhe and twist knotting and unknotting
until Trinity slips free--

Grabbing the light as he grabs her

Twisting back she smashes it into his face pitching the
room into darkness except for the light that falls through
the hatch

She lunges for the ladder scrambling up it as a shadow leaps
after her

INT LOGOS - LOWER DECK - DAY 575

She climbs out the hatch just as Bane snatches her foot
tripping her

She slams to the floor but as he rises up through the hatch
she kicks him in the face--

Breaking his nose the treads on her boot ripping open his
upper lip

Clambering to her feet she rushes for the intercom

Bane bangs Trinity against the metal wall Stunned she falls
to the floor and before she can recover he kicks her
savagely in the ribs almost flipping her over

Pain explodes through her body black spots bursting in her

Bane wipes the back of his hand across his shattered nose

TRINITY
Neo

BANE
Yes we’re over here

He hears him forcing her quiet

NEO
Trinity

He runs through the heavy cabled passageways that wind around
the base of the core leading to the engineering hatch

Bane stands just beyond the open floor hatch holding Trinity
whose hands are tied behind her back

Neo charges forward but stops when he sees the scalpel point
puncture the white skin of her exposed throat

BANE
Hello Mr Anderson I see you are as
predictable in this world as you are in
the other

NEO
What

TRINITY
He’s out of his mind

BANE
It might appear that way to you but Mr
Anderson and I know that appearances can
be deceiving

A rush of something familiar floods Neo’s mind

BANE (CONTD)
Confused Mr Anderson It’ll all become
clear in a moment Now thank you for
bringing me the gun you can set it down
right there

TRINITY
Don’t do it

The scalpel bites deeper

TRINITY (CONT’D)
Shoot Neo Shoot now
BANE
Yes shoot Fry us Burn us alive

Neo is frozen
TRINITY
Do it You have to If you dont he’ll
kill us both
BANE
Look at him He knows he should do it
but he won’t

Neo raises the gun

TRINITY
I told you nothings changed Nothing

Neo braces himself to fire

BANE
He won’t do it He can’t

TRINITY
Do it

He knows what he should do

TRINITY (CONTD)
Please

But he can’t

He closes his eyes unable to kill the woman he loves and
throws down the gun

Bane smiles blood covering t
feasting carnivore

NEO
Let her go

BANE
Back away

NEO
Drop the knife

BANE
Fair enough

He drops it and it bounces clattering down through the open

hatch
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 63

BANE (CONTD)
Back away from the gun and turn around

Neo does

NEO
Let her go

With one quick shove Bane throws Trinity down the hatch as
Neo spins back catching a glimpse of her--

Falling screaming as she crashes to the metal floor below

Both men dive for the gun Bane getting there first but Neo
manages to grab the barrel

Bane yanks Neo off-balance ramming his knee into his gut
then swings the gun around and clubs Neo over the head

Neo drops to his hands and knees shaking off the blow but
when he looks up he finds himself staring down the barrel of
a gun

BANE
Somehow familiar isn’t it We’ve been
here before you and I Remember I do I
think of nothing else

INT LOGOS - ENGINEERING ROOM - DAY 582

Trinity tries to move everything hurts She can hear their
voices above her and as she rolls over she sees the scalpel
glinting in the light

INT LOGOS - LOWER DECK - DAY 583

Bane stands over Neo blood still dripping from his ruined
face

NEO
Who are you

BANE
You still don’t recognize me I admit it
is difficult to even think encased in
this rotting piece of meat the stink of
it filling every breath a suffocating
cloud you can’t escape

Mucus bubbles out of his mangled nose

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 64

Look at this Disgusting Look at how
pathetically fragile it is Any excuse
and it begins to spew

He spits a clot of blood

BANE (CONTD)

INT LOGOS ENGINEERING ROOM - DAY 584

Trinity saws through the wire binding her wrists Closing her
mind to the pain she pushes herself up and steps towards the
ladder but as she does-

A piece of glass from the broken light crunches under her
boot

She looks up as Bane looks down

Leaping for the ladder she sees Bane kick the hatch shut and
as she is buried in darkness she hears the wheel-lock snap
into place

TRINITY
No Neo

Neo starts for him but Bane is too far the gun holding him
in check

TRINITY
That’s it It’s got to be

She yanks the fuse

INT LOGOS - LOWER DECK - DAY

The lights go out

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 66

There is a window between the moment Bane understands what
happened and the moment he fires the gun It is a window that
is only a fraction of a second wide--

But that is wide enough

The lightning bolt slashes open the darkness a sizzling ball
of electricity that bursts against the ground where Neo had
been but is no longer

In the strobing light of the gun Neo lunges for Bane diving
into him colliding with the gun that continues to fire-

Raking up the walls severing cables that shower the darkness
with star-bursting spark light

Neo tackles Bane driving into him toppling him backward
until they both crash to the ground--

The gun bouncing free

The two men merge into a single writhing shadow limbs
flailing wildly as they fight to separate

Gone is the grace and precision of fighting in the Matrix
Neo swings his fist like a club bludgeoning it against
Bane’s skull--

Each blow laying open the flesh covering his knuckles while
sending shivers of pain shooting up his forearm

The fight is violent and chaotic two dogs searching for the
others neck--

Neo finds it first his hands clamping like jaws onto Bane’s
throat He leans into it with all his might trying to crush
his windpipe

Bane thrashes madly eyes bulging until--

His hand seizes hold of a snaking black cable its end
hissing spitting embers like a roman candle

He jams it straight into Neos face sending him screaming
backwards

INT LOGOS ENGINEERING ROOM DAY 590

Neo is badly burned a slash of white blistered flesh across
both eyes

Bane scurries away grabbing the nearest weapon he sees a
thick piece of pipe

Neo spins toward the sound and Bane freezes realizing two
things at once the gun is at Neo’s feet but he can’t see
it

Neo is blind

Bane laughs as Neo tries to find his bearings stepping away
from the gun

BANE
I wish you could see yourself Mr
Anderson

Bane leads Neo further away his voice luring him into the
Main chamber

BANE (CONTD)
A blind messiah

He slowly feels his way towards him but as Bane moves Neo
seems to lose him for a moment

BANE (CONTD)
A symbol for your kind Helpless
Pathetic

Bane circles back his grip tightening on the pipe

BANE (CONTD)
Just waiting to be put out of your
misery

Raising the pipe he swings it like a bat but just as it’s
about to cave in Neo’s head--

Neo ducks

Bane blinks in disbelief immediately swinging again but Neo
Catches hold of his wrist Bane is again surprised as Neo
leans in his ruined eyes looking at Bane or more accurately
looking into him as--

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 68

We see what Neo sees a world of total darkness except for
the pale glowing specter of Agent Smith like a ghost made of
phosphorescent light his sunglasses like the dark sockets of
a skull

NEO
I can see you

Smith’s face slackens with fear as Neo attacks--
Twisting Bane’s arm snapping it violently as Bane howls

Neo spins the pipe jamming the end into Bane’s gut dropping
him to the ground

Bane looks up the white of his eyes bright against his blood-
wet face

BANE
It’s not over Mr Anderson

The ghost of Smith also looks up at him

SMITH
It’s not over

Neo brings the pipe down bashing in Bane’s skull as--

The ghost head explodes the entire skein of Smith bursting
apart like a balloon particles of light rushing up and away
as if a fierce wind blew through a bonfire

In one world Neo stands over Bane’s lifeless body

tin another world Neo stands alone in total darkness

INT MJOLNIR - GUNNERY BAYS - NIGHT 640
A Sentinel leaps onto the back of the hull

ROLAND
There’s a shit-storm of them

He swings his gun spray at it cutting through its tentacles
The severed limb is a flash of mangled circuitry and silicon
gristle as the Sentinel cartwheels into oblivion

Link saws his turrets back and forth carving through the

A Sentinel leads a chain of them swooping onto the ship
clustering around a large antenna

Ghost has the best angle swinging his turret around
targeting the Sentinels as they sink their lasers into the
scaled metal flesh feasting on the exposed electrical
innards

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 81

On hands and knees they move forward towards the thin gap
created by the two major pipes running overhead The pipes
elbow down creating the edge of a “waterfall” that flows from

the upper level to the lower dock floor

Zee holds Charra by the belt as Charra squeezes out between
the two major pipes and peers over the edge Below her the
Digger that has crashed through one of the bridges that stood
beneath her folds in its legs as it begins to drill into the
dock floor

CHARRA
Just give me one clean shot

The protective school of Sentinels seems to open for a moment
and she fires the twin shells slipping through finding the
bulls-eye of the molten center of the digger’s core exhaust

The missiles hit starting a chain-reaction that ends with the
sunken digger exploding—-

Concrete and metal shrapnel erupting like a volcano as a
section of the dock floor is demolished

The Sentinels scream as though they were hit immediately
swarming after Zee and Charra who scurry back into the tight
channel--

Sentinels swarm above them landing with the crashing din of
metal to metal as they jam their tentacles into the thin
running channels between the pipes

Zee and Charra race for the open hatch dodging and diving
between the stabbing tentacles with a mounting sense of
impossibility that rises until--

She screams just as Zee reaches the open hatch ‘Zee can only
watch as another tentacle stabs through Charra’s stomach
impalingeucserting her

apart ‘his flesh like meat being gouged from a lobster tail

INT ZION COUNCILLOR HAMMAN’S ROOM - NIGHT 724

The council is crowded into the private quarters questioning
the three Captains

She nods

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002

DILLARD
So you gave them your ship

NIOBE
That is correct councillor I did

GRACE
Knowing what he planned to do with it

HAMMAN
And the Oracle said nothing of this

NIOBE
She told me that Neo would need my help
and that when the time came I would
choose to help him or not

WEST
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system -

ROLAND
None It’s completely impossible But he
wouldnt listen He wouldnt even take
any ammunition He was totally out of his
goddamn mind

Morpheus has sat as silent as a stoic until now

MORPHEUS
No

The council turns to him

MORPHEUS (CONTD)
He was not Neo is doing what he believes
he must do

What he says he says as much for himself as for them

He stands

MORPHEUS (CONTD)
t don’t know if what he’s doing is right
t don’t know if hell reach the Machine
city and if he does I don’t know what he
ean do to save us But I do know that as
long as there is a single breath in his
body he will never give up

INT ZION — COMMAND CENTER -— NIGHT 722

A large spool of black cable bangs against the metal floor as
a new line is uncoiled out from a large portable power

supply

The control room is a frenzy as they work to bring the
defense systems back online

Operations Officers Mattis and Wirtz study the hologram of
the dock as a ring of Sentinels circle the silent digger

WIRTZ
What are they doing

MATTIS
I don’t know Better get the Commander

INT ZION — DOCKS - NIGHT 723

A single Sentinel has attached itself to the abdomen of the
digger tentacles and feelers merging with heavy machinery

Its red eyes throb hypnotically as its brethren glide ritual-
like around it in a steady inciting circle

INT ZION — COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 724

A crowd has now gathered around the screen including
Commander Lock They watch as it floats above the digger

LOCK
Goddamnit

MATTIS
What are they doing

LOCK
The same thing we are

INT ZION -— DOCKS - NIGHT 725

Electricity crackles from the Sentinel wrapping the digger
in a gossamer web of blue light The flashing bolts light up
the dock like a giant arc welder

There is a small explosion inside the gut of the digger a
burst of combustion as it is jolted back to life And the
Sentinel falls lifelessly to the dock floor

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 105

Its enormous arms crank open a crane unfolding as it begins
to lift itself

The grinders roar to life getting up to speed before it
lowers itself back down

Immediately Sentinels swarm around it gliding in tight
circles so many of them that it feels as though a wall were
being built to protect it

INT ZION -— COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 726

The rumble of the digger returning to its job shakes the
room

FIRST OPERATOR
What do we do now Commander

Lock doesn’t have an answer
EXT BLACK DESERT - NIGHT 727

Neo looks out at the distant horizon that breaks against the
jagged edge of a mountain range

He is able to see a powerful source of light glowing like a
sun about to rise hidden behind a horizon of seething
darkness

INT LOGOS - COCKPIT -— NIGHT 728

NEO

There Those mountains That’s it

TRINITY

Do you see what’s coming
NEO

Yes
TRINITY

If you tell me were going to make it
Ill believe you

NEO
Well make it

He reaches out for her hand She takes it

NEO (CONTD)
We have to

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 i106

EXT BLACK DESERT NIGHT

Through the window of the cockpit we see what’s coming a
massive force of huge heavy war Machines led by a swarm of

Sentinels

INT ZION - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Lock addresses the Council and military heads

LOCK
It is now a matter of time The Machines
will breach the walls of the city I
recommend the Council join the rest of
the non-military personnel inside the
Temple

GRACE
How long do we have

LOCK
Two hours Maybe less

The Council reacts with obvious dismay

LOCK (CONTD)

My men have begun fortifying the entrance
with enough artillery to make our last
stand Beyond that there isn’t anything
more I can do

DILLARD
Commander do you think that we have a
chance of surviving

LOCK
If I were you Cor neilor I wouldn’t ask

Ou uned ask

me that question I

He gestures towards Hamman and Morpheus

DILLARD
Why

LOCK
Because they’re the ones that believe in
miracles

EXT BLACK DESERT NIGHT

The Logos flies into the jaws of the Armada Machines
rows of jagged shark-teeth

forming

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 107

They attack in a frenzy red lasers stabbing into the Logos
as the larger armored crab-like machines spit bolts of energy
that break against the hull sending a shiver of sizzling
electricity through the entire ship

INT LOGOS - COCKPIT NIGHT 732

Trinity has to let go of the stick as hot arcing voltage
surges through the controls

Neo clings to her hand as he wades into battle hurling his
mind at them with ballistic force

EXT LOGOS — NIGHT 733

Three spinning Sentinels release three tow-bombs that open up
as they rocket towards the ship

Neo reacts quickly exploding the first immediately the
second just before it hits the fire washing over the
windshield as the Logos shoots through

But the third he grabs hold of straining against its force
and direction bending it to his will as he once bent a
spoon

The device sails up over the cockpit before turning and
hurtling back at the Machines

The Sentinels dodge out of the way but the armored
crustacean is too slow and--

The device slams into it unleashing a violent orange rage of
destruction

The dog-fight continues as the Sentinels now reach the Logos
leaping onto its back sticking their lasers through its hide
like toreadors thrusting swords into the back of a charging
bull

INT LOGOS - COCKPIT - NIGHT 734
Sweat covers Neo’s body as he reacts more and more violently

NEO
There’s too many

EXT LOGOS — NIGHT 735

A Sentinel dives like a kamikaze straight at the cockpit as
Neo reaches out to stop it--
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 108

Wrestling with it As its eyes begin to blink it corkscrews
wildly out of control slamming against the heavy plated
glass which shatters cratering under the Machines bulk as--

We experience what Neo experiences a meteor of light that
blasts through his body--

INT LOGOS COCKPIT - NIGHT 736
Wrenching free his grip from Trinity

His arm flails back as he feels himself disconnect his mind
flung loose until--

She snatches hold of him again

TRINITY
I got you

His head swims as he drags himself back from the abyss

TRINITY (CONTD)
Come on Neo I need help here

Ahead they are approaching a perfect line of fearsome
floating Machines each like an entire division of tanks
welded into one

NEO
-left

TRINITY
What

NEO
Bank left

A tank fires just as Trinity banks left a missile of energy
chewing up the entire underbelly of the ship

Inside the cockpit several monitors explode and the main
lights die

NEO (CONTD)
I can’t beat them

TRINITY
What do we do

NEO
Go up Over them

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 109

TRINITY
What
NEO
The sky
She looks at him
NEO (CONTD)
It’s the only way
TRINITY
Then up we go
She pounds on the pedal and outside the pads erupt opening
all the way as the ship tips-
EXT BLACK SKY — NIGHT 737

Rocketing towards the churning black sky leaving a white-hot
jet trail that cuts up from the black earth at a forty-five
degree angle

Several Sentinels leap from the back of the ship but many
remain as it barrels towards the dark roiling ceiling

The Logos plunges into the sky with a surreal splash like a
plane crashing into a sea of shaving cream

The molecular replicators immediately drain the life from the
Sentinels and they fall dead--

Tearing through the clouds that cling to them momentarily

like shredded pieces of parachute before letting them fall
away

The Logos is engulfed by a ball of lightning as it is

attacked by the sky It shakes violently every light blowing
out until the ship dies--

INT LOGOS - COCKPIT - NIGHT 738
Drowning the cockpit with darkness where we glimpse--

Two hands still holding tight

EXT BLUE SKY -— DAY 739

The forward momentum carries them just a little higher until
suddenly there is a spectacular explosion of light as--

The ship breaks out the other side revealing a perfect blue
sky lit by a brilliant yellow sun

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 110

INT LOGOS COCKPIT - DAY 740

The light washes over her face with a warmth she has never
known It is a vision of the real world she has never seen

TRINITY
-beautiful

EXT BLUE SKY - DAY 741
The ship hits its apex hangs then slowly twists as it

begins to fall slipping quickly back into the billowing

black silk of clouds

a
Their stomachs pitch as the Logos is buffeted by storm and
wind spinning like a falling leaf until--

It splashes out of the clouds revealing--
EXT THE MACHINE CITY NIGHT 742
The Machine City

To Trinity it looks like a massive mechanical coral reef
spreading as far as the eye can see

To Neo it is another universe a pinwheel nebula spiraling
towards him a billion pinpricks of light strung together
swirling into clusters that blaze beneath a veil of glowing
vapor

INT LOGOS COCKPIT NIGHT 743

Their fall accelerates the city rushing towards them as
Trinity again turns to Neo

NEO
Pump the ignitor The ship will start

She grabs the lever and pumps Tries the ignition Nothing

NEO (CONTD)
Again

She does it again pumping vigorously

NEO (CONTD)
Slowly

Calmly methodically she pumps the lever while the
architecture of the city gains dimension its towers rising
like fingers of a hand reaching up with a rushing force
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 111
743 743

Neo feels the energy in the ignition slowly building as a
single tower now looms filling the entire windscreen

Trinity closes her eyes pumping vigilantly until-

NEO (CONTD)
Now

She hits the ignition opening her eyes to the tower that is
now a wall

The engine fires the pads crackle with life and their fall
slows but not fast enough

744 EXT MACHINE CITY TOWER NIGHT 744
The ship bores into the tower plowing through the nano-built
structure that is a surrealist re-combining of the organic
and the mechanical an anthill or wasps’ nest built froma
webwork of pipes wires and silicon

745 INT LOGOS - COCKPIT -— NIGHT 745
The windshield explodes as Neo and Trinity are again torn

apart The ship merges violently with the tower grinding to
a final wrenching stop

All becomes quiet

Cobwebs of shimmering light drape all around Neo as it takes
him a moment to realize that he is in fact still alive

NEO
-Trin

There is no response

NEO (CONTD)
Trinity Trinity

Yanking his feet free from the crush of debris he crawls in
the direction of her chair

NEO (CONTD)

Trinity

TRINITY
-I’m here

NEO
Where

She reaches her hand out to him

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002

TRINITY
Here

With her touch comes a flood of relief

NEO
We made it

TRINITY
You said we would

He draws closer feeling his way

NEO
I couldnt have done it without you

TRINITY
--l know

He smiles unable to see her he looks at the gossamer
threads of light surrounding them

NEO
It’s unbelievable Trin Light
everywhere Like the whole thing was
built of light I wish you could see what
I see

We see her face for the first time and we see that she is
erying

TRINITY
Youve already shown me so much

He knows something is wrong

NEO
What is it Trinity What’s wrong
TRINITY

I can’t go with you Neo I’ve gone as
far as I can

NEO

He reaches for her and immediately feels the wet warmth of

her blood soaking through her shirt

NEO (CONTD)
Oh no no no

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 113

Long shafts of metal are driven through her body like needles
pinning a butterfly in place

TRINITY
It’s all right Neo It’s time I’ve done
what I can do Now you have to do the
rest

NEO
No

TRINITY
You have to You have to finish it You
have to save Zion

NEO
I can’tnot without you
TRINITY
You can You will I believe it I always

have
Tears leak from his bandages

NEO
Trinity you can’t die You can’t

TRINITY
Yes I can You brought me back once But
not this time

He doesn’t want to believe it

TRINITY (CONTD)
Do you remember on that roof after you
caught me The last thing I said to you

NEO
You said I’m sorry

TRINITY
I wish I hadn’t That was my last
thought I wished that I had one more
chance to say what mattered

He feels her tears on his fingertips

TRINITY (CONTD)
To say how much I loved you how grateful
I was for every moment I was with you
but by the time I knew how to say what I
wanted it was too late

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 114

She smiles
TRINITY (CONTD)
But you brought me back You gave me my
wish one more chance To say what I
really wanted to say
For the last time she reaches up and touches his face
TRINITY (CONTD)
Kiss meonce morekiss me
He lowers his lips to hers and it ends as it began--
With a kiss
He feels her last breath on his lips and he weeps holding
the hand that can no longer hold him back
INT ZION TEMPLE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 746

The rumbling of the digger shakes all of Zion The Temple is
congested with panicked chaos Near the entrance Lock is
organizing the defense

INT ZION - NIGHT 747
The entire tower is quivering as the wall begins to crack

The wall splits giving birth to a ball of metal teeth
spitting rock and dust The digger chews through rending

rock shredding steel and shaking the entire city

It emerges with a final rearing thrust then tips free and
falis--

Smashing through the lacework of catwalks before crashing
into the knotted tangle of pipe at the base of Zion burying
into the bedrock and metal like a knife to its hi Lt

The black hole breathes brimstone as a cloud of dust settles
over Zion like a shroud

INT ZION TEMPLE NIGHT 748

People cling to each other as the booming crash echoes
through their bodies

Link holds Zee and looking up at the dark ceiling of the
Temple he whispers

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 115

LINK
Neo You gonna do something you better
do it quick
INT MACHINE CITY TOWER NIGHT 749

Neo climbs Feeling his way rising from the wreckage along
the coiled mechanical intestines

There are sounds all around him a ratcheting clatter that
rises and fades like a rattlesnake warning the hiss of a
radiator pipe the scrape of a rake dragged against concrete
The sounds circle as if patiently watching him like vultures
watching a dying man

He heaves himself up into a large passageway running
horizontally through the tower It spirals coiling inward
woven out of shiny metal rods that are ribbed and knuckled
like bones

INT MACHINE CITY TOWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 750

As Neo stands we experience the passage as he does a tunnel
of light its surface as perfectly smooth as a mirror

He steps forward and a ripple spreads out from his foot as
though he were walking on water that had been rolled into a
tube

At the end of the passage there is an opening that windows
out of the tower Neo moves towards it until he stands on
the edge awed by what he sees

EXT MACHINE CITY TOWER - NIGHT 751

He sees the Machine city an endless sprawling metropolis
built out of pure energy Towers of glowing spun glass rise
up from crystalline structures of radiant light

Everywhere hovering like hummingbirds are creatures
seemingly created out of fibers of light soldered into
patterns of a three dimensional circuit board

There is a celestial and even spiritual quality to the image
until we reveal the city-in-itself-—

A dark industrial nightmare Underlit by angry bursts of
lightning Demons of black steel and chrome hang everywhere

“ crawling along the walls the springs in their limbs

tightening like a rat trap being loaded--

While thousands of blood-red eyes bore into Neo

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 116

Suddenly those closest to him scatter leaping from the
walls flying away clearing as small fish run from the
approach of a much bigger fish

From below an enormous and complex Machine rises to face
Neo It is so large that it eclipses the entire city

Neo steadies himself overwhelmed momentarily by its power
and brilliance

The Deus ex Machina unleashes a locust swarm of tiny machines
that seem ready to envelop Neo

NEO
I only ask to say what I have come to
say After that do what you want and I
won’t try to stop you

The locust swarm swirls back creating an undulating ball of
mechanical bugs that remain in constant motion

Neo experiences the Deus ex Machina as a huge ball of energy
like a sun its face in constant flux

The bugs coalesce and an almost human face pushes itself out
from underneath

DEUS EX MACHINA
SPEAK

The voice has a synthesized quality resonating with a sense
that it is not one voice but every voice

NEO
The program called Smith has grown beyond
your control

The face disappears as quickly as it appeared
NEO (CONTD)
Soon he will spread through this city as
he spread through the Matrix

The locusts begin vibrating chittering and trembling like
animals sensing a storm

NEO (CONTD)
You cannot stop him But I can

Rage explodes from the face spitting bugs at Neo as it
screams

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 117

DEUS EX MACHINA
WE DO NOT NEED YOU WE NEED NOTHING
NEO
If that’s true then I’ve made a mistake
and you should kill me now
The face fades the storm circling Neo for a moment before
slowly collecting itself as the face re-emerges
DEUS EX MACHINA
WHAT DO YOU WANT
Neo looks up into the blinding brightness
NEO
Peace
‘INT ZION —- TEMPLE ENTRANCE — NIGHT 752
The Sentinel army pours from the dark gaping mouth flooding
the entire city
INT ZION -— TEMPLE - NIGHT 753

The kid swallows hard wiping the sweat from his palms as he
steadies the grip on his gun

INT ZION — TEMPLE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 754

The leading force descends to the Temple entrance limbs
outstretched like the talons of an attacking bird of prey

The first Sentinel slams down onto the metal bridge rearing
back on its haunches as its brethren smack down behind him

INT ZION - TEMPLE - NIGHT 755

Every gun is clutched like a talisman as the Sentinel peers
into the cave

INT ZION - TEMPLE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 756

Suddenly a circling Sentinel jerks upward its communication
dish snapping open It raises it as if trying to hear
something

The message spreads quickly as the clicking dishes fan open
in every Sentinel

The lead Sentinel backs up

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 118
INT ZION - TEMPLE - NIGHT 757
Niobe doesn’t understand it
NIOBE
What are they doing
Morpheus isn’t sure
INT MACHINE CITY TOWER -— NIGHT 758

The entire passageway comes alive around Neo as cables and
metal rods grow like a time-lapsed plant forming a seat
under him and filling every jack

A cobra-like cable rises up to the back of Neo’s neck
pausing its needle probing at the brain-jack

DEUS EX MACHINA
AND IF YOU FAIL

NEO
I won’t

The face almost smiles as it fades away

The cable thrusts into Neo plunging the pistol-needle into
his brain plugging his cansciousness into the Matrix

INT ZION - TEMPLE - NIGHT 759
Morpheus sets his gun down and stands up

NIOBE
What are you doing

He steps over the barricade and walks
entrance

LOCK
Morpheus

Lock signals to several soldiers to cover him The kid
lurches out just behind Niobe

Morpheus stops at the edge of the pool of water Outside the
Temple he can see the Sentinels gliding in slow patterns

Three Sentinels lay just outside the opening like sleeping
lions

One of the soldiers raises his gun and a Sentinel leaps to
its feet with the sound of a dozen machine guns being cocked

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 119

MORPHEUS
No

The soldier drops his gun and slowly the Sentinel lowers back
down

NIOBE
Neo

Morpheus nods

MORPHEUS
He fights for us

EXT MATRIX CITY STREET — NIGHT 760

A sick green-black sky vomits a raging storm upon the urban
night-scape below Lightning spits from every cloud like the
constant flicker of snake tongues

Black boots stride down the center of the rain soaked street

We follow as Neo walks glancing left then right at a city
of Agent Smiths They line the streets their perfect
silhouettes filling the windows of skyscrapers It is a city
of dark-suited sunglass-wearing shadows

Lightning flash-bulbs a group of them staring at Neo
smiling identically

A singular Smith enters the street and turns towards Neo
walking at him until they stand like gun fighters--

Face to face
SMITH
Mr Anderson Welcome back We missed
you

Rain pours off his face as lightning pitchforks the sky
behind him

SMITH (CONTD)
Like what I’ve done with the place

Another bolt strikes this time in front of him so we see it
reflected in his sunglasses

NEO
It ends tonight

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 120

SMITH
I know it does I’ve seen it That’s why
the rest of me is just going to enjoy the
show We already know that I’m the one
that beats you

NEO
The only place you can beat me Smith--

He snaps open his coat his body automatically settling into
a defensive position

NEO (CONTD)
Is in your dreams

Smith’s smile twists into a sneer and he hurls himself at his
enemy

The first exchange is a squall fast and furious as
lightning strobes the water exploding with every blow

They mirror one another neither one gaining or losing ground
until each sees the exact same opening-

Simultaneously delivering a thunder packed punch that sends
both men flying backwards-—-

Neo flips and lands gracefully while Smith smashes down
concrete buckling beneath him

Smith growls cocking and loading himself then firing out
hurtling up through the driving rain as--

Neo leaps to meet him and they collide high above the street
Two equal and opposite forces slamming together like atoms
smashing as an expanding sphere of energy is unleashed from

the collision--

A globe of glass clearing away the rain swelling until it
breaks open against the surrounding urban cliffs

The two men remain suspended in mid-air battling fists and
feet thrown with particle-accelerator speed

Neo fights with ultimate precision but Smith has become
overwhelmingly powerful A blow snaps Neo’s head back
sending his glasses flying and before he recovers--

Smith grabs him spinning like a decathlete in the hammer
toss and releases—

Hurling Neo into the side of a building

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 121

He smashes into the building like a bullet another seismic
wave of damage shattering the face of the building following
the initial impact the way thunder follows lightning

INT MATRIX BUILDING - NIGHT 761

Looking back through the bored opening his body just created
Neo barely has time to stand before Smith barrels into him

The battle rages through the building Smith pummeling Neo
with wrecking ball force--

Smashing him through walls of concrete brick and steel

Smith steps through one of the holes as Neo struggles to get
back on his feet

SMITH
Can you feel it Mr Anderson Closing in
on you once more I can
Once more Neo picks himself up
SMITH (CONTD)
I really should thank you for it After
all it was your life that taught me the
purpose of all life
He smiles

SMITH (CONTD)
The purpose of life is to end

Neo settles into a pose we have seen before He signals to
Smith “come get some”

Nothing frustrates Smith as much as that little wave

Another fury roars through the building but this one ends
with Neo unloading an explosion of kicks culminating in-

Bullet Time a final boot launched like a LAS rocket
blasting Smith--

EXT MATRIX CITY STREET - NIGHT 762

Out of the building sailing back through the sheets of rain

“until he slows regaining control He looks back at the

opening in the building where-

Neo stands lit by flashing lightning

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 122

Smith grinds his teeth and launches himself back at him while
Neo dives into the open air and--

Again they fly at each other the impact of this collision
much more powerful than the first as--

Waves of force shatter windows and rip lamp posts from the
concrete like a hurricane uprooting trees

EXT MATRIX CITY STREET - MID-AIR - NIGHT 763

They fight in mid-air punching kicking grappling locked
together but in constant motion like electrons chasing each
other around a single nucleus--

Oblivious to the height they rise up beyond the city’s glass
towers until they are amidst the flashing electric tongues of
lightning and the city is a distant pattern of light beneath
them

Smith lands a series of savage blows that stun Neo and he
slips down twisting lost for a moment suddenly vulnerable

Above him Smith rises up just as twin bolts of lightning
strike haloing the dark-suited demon with jagged broken rays
of light

With the crashing din of thunder that follows Smith attacks

Diving down he slams into Neo tackling him driving him
back to the earth--

Streaking like a comet faster than the rain plummeting past
the mirrored towers as Neo struggles to get free fighting
even as the inevitability of the ground rushes towards them
and-—

The unstoppable force meets the immovable object

EXT MATRIX STREET CRATER - NIGHT 764

The concussive blast craters the street buckling buildings
as a wave of unequaled destruction rushes out over the urban
chasm

The explosion thunders away until there is only the hissing
rain as the Smiths gather along the craters edge

Inside the bowl of earth is the exposed viscera of the
metropolis broken pipes sparking cables and rent sewers

The rain on his face slowly brings Neo’s consciousness back

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 123

Smith stands over him as he tries to get up

SMITH
Why Mr Anderson

It is an effort to even pull his arm from the wet sucking
mud

SMITH (CONTD)
Why do you do it Why get up Why keep
fighting

Neo rolls over pushing himself to his hands and knees

SMITH (CONTD)
Do you believe you’re fighting for
something For more than your survival
Can you tell me what it is Do you even
know

Neo glares at him with animal-like eyes

SMITH (CONTD)
Is it freedom Or truth Perhaps peace
Yes No Could it be for love

He laughs

SMITH (CONTD)
Illusions Mr Anderson Vagaries of
perception The temporary constructs of a
feeble human intellect trying desperately
to justify an existence that is without
meaning or purpose

Neo’s hands clench into fists

SMITH (CONTD)
And all of them as artificial as the
Matrix itself although only a human mind
could invent something as insipid as
love

Rain streaks the mud down Neo’s face like black tears
SMITH (CONTD)
You must be able to see it Mr Anderson
You must know it by now You can’t win
Its pointless to keep fighting

Neo summons his strength and once more he stands

Smith howls in frustration hurling at him but Neo absorbs
the attack catching Smith momentarily off-balance-

Firing back a furious attack that has Smith reeling unable
to defend himself as Neo loads up a bomb It is not a punch
it is a cannonball--

Shot into Bullet Time his fist shattering through the glass-
like rods of rain as it hurls at Smith--

Connecting flush distorting his features as the flesh of his
face is knocked loose and his eyes go blank

He staggers stunned out on his feet as Neo hauls back and

gathers the Tai-chi ball summoning every last bit of his

energy his life-force then--

Slams it into Smith catapulting him into the wall of the
crater

Burying him from sight

Neo sways in the rain with barely enough strength to stand as
the army of Smiths look down from the crater edge

A low ominous rumble begins to shake the earth Neo drops his
head unable to watch as the rumble rises until-

The wall of the crater explodes like an exit wound earth and
asphalt shot-gunning out as Smith bursts from his grave

He hangs in the air his mud-covered face distorted with
rage

SMITH
This is my world My world

He dives into Neo who has nothing left and batters him each
bludgeoning blow striking in time with searing bolts of
Lightning

He seizes Neo by the throat hoisting him up like a rag doll
and fires a super-punch that sends Neo flying--

Bouncing down to the earth like a crashing airplane
trenching to a stop

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 125

smith is about to press his frenzied assault but he freezes
the image of Neo laying splayed suddenly familiar

SMITH (CONTD)
Wait I’ve seen this This is it
This is the end

He looks at Neo and in a flash of lightning we see the
immediate future as Smith stabs his entire fist into Neo’s
chest

Smith blinks away the raindrops blurring his vision

SMITH (CONTD)
Yes you were laying right there just
like that And I

Another flash and we see the black mirror begin to cover
Neo’s body

Smith walks over to Neo who is desperately clinging to his
consciousness as if hanging from the edge of a precipice

SMITH (CONTD)
I stand here right here and I’m supposed
to say something I say

Again the future flashes in his eyes and he sees Neo’s hands
buried beneath the gleaming blackness

SMITH (CONTD)
Everything that has a beginning has an
end

The familiar words suddenly clear Neo’s mind He looks up as
Smith looks down

SMITH (CONTD)
Dont be afraid Neo

Neo almost cant believe what he just heard as--

Another flash reveals the liquid obsidian covering Neo’s
face but his face is calm even serene

SMITH (CONTD)
What What did I just say

In his confusion he looks to Neo who now understands
SMITH (CONTD)

No no This isn’t right This can’t be
right
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 126

One final time Neo rises to his feet

SMITH (CONTD)
Get away from me

NEO
What are you afraid of
SMITH
It’s a trick
NEO
No it’s what you want It’s why you’re
here
SMITH
No
NEO
You were right Smith You were always
right

Rain pours down Smith’s tortured face

NEO (CONTD)
It was inevitable

Smith’s eyes fire a scream rises up from him and in a
crackling blinding flash of lightning--

He stabs his fist into Neo who stands with his arms open
accepting the blow

Exactly as in the flashing visions Neo is covered by the
darkness Rising up over his face Neo closes his eyes and is
lost beneath the liquid shroud

The whole sky continues to weep as Smith enters him
possessing him as the darkness snaps into a perfect pair of
sunglasses

The mud covered Smith backs away from the new Smith as if not
trusting him

SMITH
Is it over

The new Smith nods his head once and the old Smith smiles
And as a giddiness spreads through him he starts to laugh

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 127

INT MACHINE CITY TOWER -— NIGHT 765
Neo’s body hangs motionless supported by the passageway as

we see as Neo would an empty husk that is being filled

liquid light pouring into him from every connection

EXT MATRIX CITY STREET - NIGHT 766

The old Smith realizes that he is laughing alone There is
something wrong with the new Smith

The new Smith begins to tremble a shiver that grows into a
convulsion

OLD SMITH
Oh no no no It’s not fair It’s not
fair
INT MACHINE CITY TOWER -— NIGHT 767

Neo’s body arches his arms pinned wide as he tries to scream
but instead of sound a shaft of light beams out

He opens his eyes and light pours out of them

EXT MATRIX CITY STREET - NIGHT 768
Light brightens around Smith’s sunglasses until they begin

to crack and shred like wet tissues as shafts of brilliant
light burst free

Now the old Smith begins to feel it as his body begins to
shiver uncontrollably

OLD SMITH
No

The new Smith continues to crack open light beaming out from
his distended and deteriorating form filling the entire
crater as--

One by one it spreads through to all the Smiths

Shafts of light burst from the shells of Smith like water
breaking through a dam dissolving away each dark silhouette--

Until there are hundreds of faceless forms all made out of
bright radiant light

The old Smith at the center of the crater fights to the
last His scream rails against the buildings as he bursts
open and is consumed by light

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 128

From high above we see the explosion of blinding light sweep
through the entire city as--

INT MACHINE CITY TOWER -— NIGHT 769

A final surge rushes through Neo his body convulsing against
his metal coils and we see the light drain out of him as
life slowly leaves him and his body falls quiet and still

Neo dies
OMITTED SCENE 770 770
INT MATRIX CRATER -— NIGHT 771

In the center of the crater lies the body of the Oracle
INT MACHINE CITY TOWER - NIGHT 772

The cables and rods lower Neo’s lifeless body as it is laid
onto the floor of the mechanical cave

The face of the Deus ex Machina gazes once more upon him

DEUS EX MACHINA
It is done

The face recedes and the enormous Machine sinks away like a
setting sun

INT ZION - TEMPLE NIGHT 773

A hovering Sentinel closes its dish turns and rises
of the hole made by the digger One by one the other
Sentinels follow

No one can believe what they are seeing
Lock stands alone clutching his gun

LOCK
It doesn’t make sense

Morpheus walks across the stream and stands at the door of
the Temple looking up at what is without question a miracle
the entire Sentinel army leaving Zion

MORPHEUS
He did it
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 129
773 773

The others move in behind him their faces staring up in awe

KID
He saved us He saved us

The last of the Machines glide out of sight and waves of
emotion sweep through all of them

The kid cant hold it in and he screams joy bursting out of

him
KID (CONTD)
He did it It’s over He did it
774 INT ZION - TEMPLE - NIGHT 774

His voice spills out into the Temple as he follows almost
falling caught by several soldiers

HAMMAN
What is it What’s happened
KID
Sir Councilor he did it sir Neo did
it
HAMMAN
Did what
KID

He ended the war The Sentinels are gone
It’s over sir The war is over

Hamman is unable to breathe as he drinks down the
information The kid turns and leaps onto a boulder his
voice filling the Temple

KID (CONTD)
Zion It’s over The war is over

Tears stream down both Link and Zee’s faces as they embrace

A huge resounding cheer surges up from the people of Zion as
they break open with relief and joy

775 INT ZION - TEMPLE ENTRANCE — NIGHT 775

Morpheus and Niobe hear the cheering that rolls up out of the
Temple

Morpheus unable to move unable to embrace a moment he waited
his entire life for

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 130

MORPHEUS
I’ve imagined this moment for so long

He looks at her

MORPHEUS (CONTD)
Is it real

She nods and he reaches out to her trying to feel something
to make him believe it and--

Finding it in her arms
Niobe looks up with tears brimming in her bright eyes

NIOBE
Wherever you are Neo thank you

INT MACHINE CITY TOWER - NIGHT 776

Neos body is dragged from the passageway by a Machine that
looks like a sawed-open garbage truck

The Machine quietly and efficiently drops him onto the open
bed then turns gliding away as a barge might drift out to
sea

We see the Machine City once more as Neo did dazzling
crystalline structures of light and at the center bearing
away the body of Neo a being that appears like an angel made
from the morning sun as it glitters against the wide open
ocean

EXT MATRIX CITY STREET - NIGHT 777

Rain pebbles the angelic face of Sati as a black cat
carefully pads up next to her and licks her cheek

In a blink the cat disappears and as it does--
It stops raining

The cracked and broken ground is now replaced with a
perfectly smooth sidewalk

Sati remains in the in the same sleeping position as the cat
again softly pads in and licks her cheek exactly as it just
did

Sati slowly wakes up and smiles at the cat

SATI
Good morning

GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 131

The cat purrs nudging against her
SATI (CONTD)
Is it morning
She yawns and lifts herself up
EXT ANOTHER STREET - DAWN 778

A pair of expensive black loafers stride down the street

The black shoes stop as the man finds what he was looking for
sitting on a park bench

The Oracle smiles at him

ORACLE
Well now ain’t this a surprise

The Architect hides his sneer in the corners of his mouth

ARCHITECT
You played a very dangerous game

ORACLE
Change always is

ARCHITECT
If it were up to me it wouldn’t have
ended this way

ORACLE
Then I’m grateful it wasn’t up to you

ARCHITECT
Just how long do you think this peace is
going to last

ORACLE
As long as it can

She smiles and he decides to leave

ORACLE (CONTD)
What about the others

ARCHITECT
What others

ORACLE
The ones that want out
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002 132
778 778

ARCHITECT
Obviously they will be freed

ORACLE
I have your word

He glances back insulted

ARCHITECT
What do you think I am Human

He smiles and walks away as Sati yells

SATI
Oracle

Carrying the cat she leads Seraph over the hill to the
bench bolting to the Oracle

SATI (CONTD)
We were afraid we might not find you

ORACLE
Everything’s okay now

SERAPH
It’s good to see you again

ORACLE
It’s always good to see you

SATI
Look Look

She points to an unbelievably beautiful sunrise rays of
extraordinarily vibrant colors streaked across the sky with
the joy and ardor of a childs finger-painting

ORACLE
Just look at that Beautiful Did you do
that

Sati beams as she nods her head

SATI
For Neo

ORACLE
Thats nice I know he’d love it

SATI
Will we ever see him again
GOLDENROD REVISIONS JUNE 27 2002

ORACLE
I suspect so Someday

She stands up

ORACLE (CONTD)
Now I don’t know about you two but I
Sure would like something to eat
Something sweet

SATI
Me too

Seraph turns to the Oracle

SERAPH
Did you always know

ORACLE
Oh no No I didn’t But I believed

She smiles

ORACLE (CONTD)
I believed

They head to their home walking into the sunrise as-—-
Young dawn raises her rose-red fingers

Fade out
