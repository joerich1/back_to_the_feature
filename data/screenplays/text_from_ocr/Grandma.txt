INT ELLE’S APARTMENT - DAY 1
An apartment filled with books and art

ELLE lives here She is 70 years old beautiful and
extremely wilful

There is nothing of the old lady about her She is selfish
and magnetic and smart

With her this morning is Olivia an attractive thirty five
year old woman who has been Elle’s lover for the last few
months

Olivia is visibly upset Elle seems much calmer She moves
around her place neatening up

OLIVIA
It’s not that I don’t love you

Elle puts a teapot into a cupboard Inside is a cap from an
academic’s cap and gown

ELLE

What the hell’s this doing in here
OLIVIA

These last four months have been

the
Olivia is trying not to cry

OLIVIA (CONTD)
The last four months have been some
of the best months of my life

ELLE
Well It’s been a short life
Comparatively

OLIVIA
Ive learned - I’ve learned so much
from you -

ELLE
Yes I’m very wise

Olivia knuckles her eye

ELLE (CONTD)
Very wizened

OLIVIA
You’re not wizened
Elle puts the medieval looking cap into a closet next to a
professor’s striped red academic gown

OLIVIA (CONTD)
You’re beautiful

ELLE
Hah So what have you learned
exactly Aside from backgammon
(re gown)
There’s a rip in this Goddam thing

OLIVIA
I’ve learnednot to buy into the
system I’ve learned persistence
Courage Dedication to one’s
craft In the face of

ELLE
All reason

OLIVIA
Youre still a wonderful poet

ELLE
(with self-contempt )
I’m not a poet I’m an academic
An unemployed one -

OLIVIA
You should send the new poems to
your editor -

ELLE
She has dementia So she might
actually like ‘em Look are you
breaking up with me or giving me a
pep talk here Stick with the
narrative

OLIVIA
Please Elle -

ELLE
We always knew

OLIVIA
We always knew what

ELLE
I mean you’re your age and I’m
rapidly approaching fifty

Olivia smiles
ELLE (CONTD)
What was gonna happen here You
don’t need a crystal ball or
anything

OLIVIA
Do you love me
(pause)
Are you in love with me

ELLE
Christ Here Blow your nose

She hands Olivia a tissue Olivia blows her nose

OLIVIA
You’ve never said it

ELLE
“Tt is a tale full of sound and
fury signifying nothing”

OLIVIA
What is love

ELLE
--e-IT’m gonna vacuum

OLIVIA
Doesn’t love conquer everything

ELLE
No

Elle involuntarily glances up at a photo on the wall

The photo is of a striking-looking woman (named Violet)
taken in the late eighties

The woman looks into the camera out at Elle

ELLE (CONTD)

No It does not conquer
everything

(pause)
Four months We were together for
four months Try thirty-eight
years Try being with someone for
thirty-eight years

(pause)
Youre a footnote
OLIVIA
“RK footnote” That’sthat’s a
horrible thing to say

ELLE
Well I’m a horrible person

(pause)

I’m gonna take a shower before I
vacuum You can let yourself out

OLIVIA
Okay I guess that’s it

ELLE
Yup That’s it

They stand there a moment
Then Olivia comes over and kisses Elle

OLIVIA
Goodbye

Elle is statue-like Doesn’t reciprocate

ELLE
Leave the key on the coffee table

Elle goes off
Olivia stands there a moment numb

Then she leaves

INT SHOWER - DAY 2
Water goes on

Water hits Elle’s face

From behind Elle’s head we see the top of a large TATTOO on
Elle’s back - a COLORFUL DRAGONFLY Elle’s shoulders begin
to SHAKE as she starts to cry

Her fists clench

She pounds the wall of the shower

CUT TO Elle is at the sink brushing her teeth vigorously
She bares her teeth at the mirror
INT ELLE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Elle is sitting on the floor wearing her striped academic

gown and cap

There are photos spread out on the floor in front of her A

know is he must have had curly
hair
