yard of a railroad

“INT DINER - DAY

Behind the counter there is a- surly-looking elderly
man mopping up the dirty counter with an even dirtier
cloth

MCNEAL
You got a guy named Underwood work

The man just jerks his head and nods toward the rear
MeNeal goes in through the rear door

MED FULL SHOT INT LUNCHROOM KITCHEN

Leaning over the sink filled with dirty dishes is a
dirty gnomish bald man with a world of bitterness on
his face His shabby coat hangs on a peg in the rear
and we can see a newspaper stuck in his coat pocket
McNeal enters

MCONEAL
Your name Underwood

Underwood Looks up for a fleeting Look
MCNEAL

Itm from the Times I want to talk
to you about the Frank Wiecek case

- Underwood again looks up and away

UNDERWOOD

anything I never heard the name
before

He goes right on washing

McNeal leans against a wall and then becomes aware of
how dirty it is He puts-a hand out to touch a table
beside the sink and he pulls his hand away from that

As he glances around disgustedly he suddenly spots the
coat hanging on a nail right beside him He moves over »
and takes outof the pocket a paper folded to the big
story on Wiecek in todays newspaper

MONEAL

So you dont remember Then why
have you got the paper turned to
my article on Wiecek Dont tell
me youtve forgotten how to read toc

(vehemently)

Wieceks in for 99 years I want
to know whether he belongs there
Was he guilty of killing that cop
or wasnt he

Underwood suddenly looks up -- pathetic and bitter and

broken

UNDERWOOD

“T dontt know I didnt care what

happened to him then -- and I dont
care now

Underwood Looks at him in disbelief then his whole
bearing changes He straightens his shoulders a little
plossoming under the respect he feels McNeal is accord-

might have been He dries his hands

Mr Palmer I realize Mr Burns knows

more about the law then I do But I

want to tell you some things about
this case that you didnt know I
started on it believing nothing I
was skeptical and cynical I figured
that Wiecek was just using his mother
to spring him But Ive changed my
mind Mr Palmer Wiecek isinnocent
I know it beyond any doubt Its true
I havent found the key-witness And
I haventt cracked her testimony But
I want a chance to find her I want
‘a chance to get Wiecek out And if
you call off this hearing weil never
get another

Looking from MeNeal to Burns Palmer considers this for

PALMER

INT STATE CAPITOL - BOARD ROOM DAY

The Pardon Board is already seated -- the clerks are
waiting and in one corner of the room sits Sam Faxon
of the State Attorneys office The Chairman of the
Board looks at his watch and then looks up at the large
clock over the entrance door He is obviously
impatient At that moment the door is flung open and
Burns comes hurriedly in- nodding to the Chairman of
the Board who nods back coldly and then nods at the
clerk “As Burns sits down at-the table and opens his
briefcase the clerk stands up-

CLERK
Hear Ye Hear Yel Special Hearing
of the Board of Pardons of the State
of Illinois now in session -

He sits down and the Chairman of the Board nods his
head at Burns

MED FULL SHOT INT BOARD ROOM - ANOTHER ANGLE

Burns rises

BURNS
Gentlemen -- I feel somewhat at a
loss -- because I came here to ask
that the petition of Frank Wiscek
be withdrawn

There is a movement of surprise and exchanged glances
at the Board table

BURNS
However about an hour ago I received
a phone call from James McNeal of the
Chicago Times who informs me that he
has uncovered the evidence we have
been seeking It is conclusive evi-
dence in support of the petition of
Frank Wiecek

Faxon looks surprised

CHAIRMAN
You may present the evidence Mr Burns

BURNS
(hesitantly)
Unfortunately gentlemen my telephone
conversation with Mr McNeal was
necessarily brief He is flying down
to Springfield and should be here at
any moment °

CHAIRMAN
(impatiently)
What evidence does he have

‘ BURNS
(helplessly)
Im afraid I dont know

The Chairman Looks impatient

Faxon gets to his feet with an air of ‘contempt

FAXON
Mr Chairman ¢
CHAIRMAN
(nodding)
-Mr Faxon
FAXON

Representing the State Attorneys
office - I object We were assured

there was sufficient available evi-
-dence to justify the incitement of

public indignation over the Wiecek
matter -- and consequently the
special hearing was granted
(contemptuously)
If Counsel did not have sufficient
evidence in his possession he should
not have requested this hearing
Counsel maintains that he now has
sufficient conclusive evidence --
(he throws his hands
wide in a gesture of
contempt)
But Counsel does not even now what
that conclusive evidence is

BURNS
(apologetically)
I find myself ina curious predica-
ment gentlemen but this is a
matter of vital importance and IT ask
your indulgence

CHAIRMAN
(sharply)
Mr Faxon we certainly intend to
follow orthodox proceduréee

Just then he stops in the middle of his speech and
listens We HEAR footsteps coming hurriedly down the
hall and the door is thrown open quickly and we see
McNeal come in ‘

eeesestrictly from a reporters view-

CHAIRMAN
And of what does this case consist

MCNEAL
Well it consists of such debatable -
items as a lie-detector test
(then quickly)
Oh I know youre unable to accept
that You want only evidence

164 MED FULL SHOT - SCENE
As McNeal warms up

MCNEAL
But sometimes the weight of evidence
-- just because its on the record --
is heavy enough to crushthe truth

CHAIRMAN
(drily)
Well discuss the shortcomings of our
judicial system some other time Mr
McNeal

MCNEAL
(embarrassed)
I know I know At present you want
the facts Well-

164 (Cont)

MCNEAL (Cont)
(he enumerates
the items)
oeWe have the notarized affidavit
of the bailiff of Judge Moultons
court that the Judge believed Wiecek
‘didnt receive a fair trial

oe CHAIRMAN

(nodding)

We have the documents vefore us Mr
McNeal They could hardly be called
conclusive

McNeal has been thrown off stride again andhe looks
up over the Chairmans head where on a support ledge
we can see a statue of JUSTICE blindfolded with a
scale in one hand and a ‘sword in the other

MCNEAL
“(pointing to the statue)
You know itsa funny thing about
that Statues of Justice Shes got
a sword in her hand Its a double-
edged swordto cut both ways
(then)
It keeps cutting the ground out from
under everything in favor of Frank
Wiecek -- but on the other side it
isnt quite so sharp It doesnt cut
the ground out from under Wanda
Skutnik
(then)
And shes the only one responsible
for Wieceks conviction

Burns eyebrows go up approvingly The Chairman frowns

MCNEAL’
As you probably know from the docu-
ments on your desk Gruska and Decker
contradict Wanda Skutniks testimony
And the two notarized affidavits sup-
port them

CHAIRMAN
The Board is aware of that too Mr
McNeal But Wanda Skutnik has not
altered her testimony has she

MCNEAL
(sharply)
Wanda Skutnik lied from beginning
to endf She lied about everything -

He “pteks a couple of things off his table and walks
toward the Board table
- MCNEAL
Here is a police record proving
that Wiecek was arrested at 5 AM
on December 22nde
(he puts it down
on the table)
And heres another police record
proving that he wasnt booked until
6 PM on-December 23rd A day-and-
a-half later gentlemen

The Chairman picks up the two police records

MCNEAL
Furthermore Wanda Skutnik said she
never saw him from the time of the
murder until she identified him in
7 the police show-up
putting down his
photograph)
But heres a photograph that shows
her getting out of a police car
with Frank Wiecek

He throws it down and the Chairman picks it up

MCNEAT
Thats new gentlemen And thats
the basis of my conclusive evidence

CHAIRMAN

(judiciously)

The two photostats of the police
records ‘simply indicate that some
time elapsed between Wieceks arrest
and the time he was booked

(he shrugs)

As a reporter you know-very well
that this is a common occurrence at
police stations

I know that But what about that
photograph showing her getting out

-of the squad car with Wiecek

CHAIRMAN
(smiling)

It must be perfectly obvious to you
Mr McNeal that we have no way of
knowing when that picture was taken
Was it on the 22nd or the 23rd or
was it perhaps during or after the”
trial

McNeal nods

MCNEAL
Thats what delayed me gentlemen
(then gravely)

If I do prove that this photograph
was taken on the 22nd of December -
the day before Wanda Skutnik identi-
fied Frank Wiecek at the police line-
up --- what then

CHAIRMAN

In that event Mr McNeal we might

be obliged to render a favorable
decision

(shrugging)
But can you prove it

MCNEAL
(soberly)
I think I can gentlemen But I
need time

CHAIRMAN”

Time Do you mean to say Mr McNeal
that you still have no corroborating
evidence

MCNEAL
