LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
PART ONE

As a background to the SCREEN CREDITS the following

CLOSE SHOT of the MOTOR BICYCLE It is large powerful andin
beautiful condition We can see that it is standing in some kind of
country shed with a background of work-bench petrol cans and so on
A few wild flowers dandelions and such are stuffed rather roughly in
a jam jar on the work-bench The shed is open-fronted and the

motor bicycle and its background are dappled with sunlight falling
through nearby leaves A MAN comes and stands between us and

the machine with his back towards us We can only see him from
the buttocks down He is wearing heavy motor-cycling boots and slaps
onto the petrol tank a pair of gauntlet gloves CAMERA stays on this
while he prepares the machine - filling the tank adjusting choke and
mixture controls ad lib as needed He mounts and kicks the starter
and moves off frame with a roar

PANNING SHOT ‘The motor-cycle leaves the farmyard into the lane

As background to FINAL CREDITS the peaceful farmyard noise of
motor-bike receding to silence Then sharp cut to

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT The MOTOR-CYCLIST Head and
shoulders On SOUND TRACK engine roaring He is so heavily
begoggled and mufflered as to be anonymous but he wears no helmet
and his bright hair is ruffled in the slipstream

MOVING SHOT of the road ahead Ata distance the road is up

It is too early in the morning for the workers to be there a NIGHT
WATCHMAN yawns over his brazier A notice says WARNING
Drain laying Roadworks ahead We throttle down and pass the
roadworks still too fast and bank for a corner Round the corner

a similar roadworks and a similar notice which we see nearer than
before the word WARNING looming larger Again we throttle down
and pass the roadworks again too fast and are accelerating
immediately towards a second corner

Coming out of the corner a third roadworks ahead The same
notice repeated this time the word WARNING almost Hiling the
screen

CLOSE SHOT of the MOTOR-CYCLIST The scarf has slipped a
little and we can see his mouth It is neither smiling nor particularly
determined but it sets into a sort of still calm as the CYCLIST
accelerates

Through the roadworks far too fast We swerve to the left to the
right tilt approach a blind bridge are out of control spin crash

6 CLOSE SHOT A piece of the road The goggles slither along it
up to CAMERA

7 CLOSE SHOT The blind stone eyes of LAWRENCEs bust ina
chapel of St Pauls Cathedral On SOUND TRACK the organ A
® MAN in very correct civilian clothes holding his bowler hat adjusts
the central wreath which has fallen askew Hedoes this not reverently
but neatly severely and then without a backward glance leaves the
chapel (past two SOLDIERS in blues who keep vigil there) and makes his
way up the aisle after the rest of the discreetly murmuring shuffling
congregation where an elderly friend a CLERIC awaits him

8 CLOSE TRACKING SHOT BRIGHTON and his FRIEND pace slowly
along the aisle past memorials to other honoured heroes which
glimmer faintly from the walls At these the CLERIC glances then

away

CLERIC
Well nil nisi bonum But I find some-
thing disproportionate in all this

BRIGHTON
(must defend Lawrence
though he cant disagree)
He was a remarkable chap By any
counts remarkable

CLERIC
(interested)
Didyou know him well

BRIGHTON

I knew him ‘

INT MAPPING ROOM BRITISH HQ CAIRO
CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE is neatly tinting a map with water

colour He sits back to look at it patiently but without enthusiasm

A shadow falls across him and he looks up interested

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCEs point of view of a basement window
Outside the lower half of a camel walks by

MED SHOT We now see that LAWRENCE is seated in a long
narrow room hardly more than a glorified passage At each end
a hole has been knocked high up in the wall and a massive bundle
of electric cables proceeds in from one to the other and out again

Continued

dimming the already inadequate light which comes through a series of
semicircular windows high up in the wall of the basement There
are six drawing boards with pots of paint brushes T squares
protractors compasses pens and ink pencils piles of rolled maps
and whatever else cartographers need Above the boards hang lamps
with metal shades and before each boardis a stool At one of
these sits the only other OCCUPANT of the room a SERGEANT

LAWRENCE
(gloomily)
Michael George Hartley this is a nasty
dark little room

SERGEANT
Ts right
LAWRENCE
We are not happy in it
SERGEANT
(thinking of the trenches)
‘lam
LAWRENCE
Then you are an ignoble fellow
SERGEANT
Ts right

He lights a cigarette throwing down the packet and box while
“ LAWRENCE watches him and goes on with his work Itis a
relationship not uncommon in the Forces the gulf of class and
‘rank has been bridged by means of a ritualised parody There is
the sound of boots on stone floor LAWRENCE looks up

CLOSE SHOT The door opens and a chirpy CORPORAL enters
with a folded newspaper Beyond him we catch a glimpse of a
telephone exchange and a flight of stairs leading upwards from

the basement

MED SHOT The CORPORAL walks over towards LAWRENCE
The phlegmatic SERGEANT takes no notice at all

LAWRENCE
Here is William Potter with my newspaper

CORPORAL
Here yare tosh

14 Continued

LAWRENCE takes the paper paying for it with a coin from his
pocket

LAWRENCE
(quite simply)
Thanks

(back to the act)

Would you care for one of Sergeant
Hartleys cigarettes

CORPORAL
Ta
It is part of the game that no-one shall smile The CORPORAL takes
one of the SERGEANTs cigarettes as LAWRENCE unfolds his paper

SERGEANT
Is it there

15 CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE holds up the paper at the front page
is in Arabic He is instantly absorbed The SERGEANT and

CORPORAL regard him with the respect which everyone feels for the -

man with a passion even uncomprehended

LAWRENCE
Of course itis Headlines
(grimly)
But Ill bet it isnt mentioned in The Times
(he indicates)
Bedouin Tribes Attack Turkish Strong-
hold And Ill bet theres no-one in the
whole of this Headquarters who even knows

its happened
(he throws down the paper)

Or would care if he did

16 MED SHOT LAWRENCE finds their sympathetic bovine gaze
upon him and laughs

LAWRENCE
Allow me to ignite your cigarette

He strikes one of the SERGEANTs matches and lights the
CORPORALs cigarette Then he extinguishes the match by very
slowly closing his finger and thumb upon the flame his face very
attentive the while It is a trick the other two have evidently seen

before but which evidently still fascinates

He goes towards LAWRENCE

18 CLOSE SHOT The CORPORAL sits down on his own stool as the
MP enters picture hands the flimsy to LAWRENCE and exits
LAWRENCE unfolds the flimsy and his expression changes The
SERGEANT takes no notice assuming it to be a routine order of
some kind LAWRENCE puts down the flimsy and takes his hat from

we °

a nail driven into the wall within reach and gets down from his stool
his face very still his eyes excited The CORPORAL is preoccupied
Cc with a burning match which he proceeds to extinguish between his
fingers

floor is covered in bleached matting on the walls are steel
engravings of old victories dead Generals and living Royalty It is
furnished with a great many basket chairs of uniform pattern
arranged in symmetrical fours round small tables with cloths of
unbleached linen

There is a bar and a billiard table in the foreground of picture Fans
turn At the bar are two or three OFFICERS One or two OTHERS
sit at tables TWO are preparing for snooker Otherwise the place
is empty Their voices are pleasant and well-modulated
LAWRENCE appears in the background walking through the Club
alongside the glass screen

The SECRETARY (GIBBON) is chalking his cue at the billiard table
He is a CAPTAIN and wears a fierce moustache like a circus ring-

‘ master The other OFFICER is also a CAPTAIN and is raising

the triangular frame from the reds when the SECRETARY sees
LAWRENCE frowns surprised and after a fractional hesitation -

- calls

SECRETARY
Lawrence

LAWRENCE veers over towards them the SECRETARY continues
with his cue until LAWRENCE is within a few paces of the table

SECRETARY
Youre supposed to be do you usually
wear your cap in the Club

The SECRETARY s tone is not hectoring but on the contrary quite

low-pitched to avoid needless embarrassment and his words
accompanied by a serious little smile LAWRENCEs tone with the
OFFICERS will be nervously aggressive whereas his tone with the
BORs was comfortable courteous and even affectionate °

LAWRENCE
Always

LAWRENCE had in fact forgotten the cap and wishes very much that
he had not His eyes slide to take in the other OFFICERS who stop
talking He relaxes deliberately

SECRETARY
still mild but not smiling)
Youre supposed to be on duty arent you
Where are you going

Continued

LAWRENCE
(reproving)
Mustn‘t talk shop Freddy Not in the
Club

The OFFICERS regard him not with animosity but with decent
disapproval
LAWRENCE

Matter of fact Im just going for a pow-
wow with the General

SECRETARY
(reasonably)
Im not asking as your superior Lawrence
Im asking as Secretary of this Club

(reasonably again)
We dont want chaps in here when they
should be on duty

(firmly)
Where are you going please

By way of answer LAWRENCE smiling knowingly takes the black
and flicks it across the table

CLOSE UP The black hits the triangle sending the balls in all
directions

MED SHOT The CAPTAIN who all this time has been chalking
his cue with considerate indifference looks up and says with frank
exasperation

CAPTAIN
I must say Lawrence

LAWRENCE looks at the littered table where the balls still roll in
confusion and the glitter leaves his face
LAWRENCE
Sorry
And he turns and goes watched by EVERYONE SECRETARY says
after him not jeering but firmly

SECRETARY

with a handsome face and buttered hair is drinking

CLOSE UP A half-empty bottle of lager falls over on the table and
spills onto the perfect breeches

CLOSE SHOT The LIEUTENANT with cruel restraint merely
puts down his glass and looks at LAWRENCE

LAWRENCE
Sorry

CLOSE SHOT An awkward pause LAWRENCE hesitates But
there is nothing to be done He goes They all look after him in
silence the LIEUTENANT of Yeomanry steadily wiping his breeches
with a handkerchief the CAPTAIN starting to rearrange the triangle
The SECRETARY turns back to the table saying clearly

SECRETARY
Pretentious oaf

INT GENERAL MURRAYS OFFICE CAIRO

CLOSE SHOT GENERAL MURRAY is one of those regulation
officers whose pride is to appear more regulation than anyone can be
His face is hard and shrewd his expression exasperated He is
seated at his desk On the wall behind him is an Illustrated London
News type pen and ink sketch of heavy artillery on the Western front
On a ledge under the picture is a collection of empty shell cases of
varying sizes GENERAL MURRAY is addressing DRYDEN a
donnish man with a pale lined lively face wearing civilian clothes
who at this moment has his back to us as he stands looking out ofa -
window overlooking the gardens of the Headquarters

MURRAY
I smell an intrigue An intrigue between
the Arab Bureau and a junior officer of
‘my staff A very junior officer an
-insubordinate junior officer an officer
who so far as I can gather has proved
markedly incompetent in a very junior post

DRYDEN turns from the window smiling a little at the reference to

LAWRENCEs incompetence and offers a smiling explanation of it

26 Continued

DRYDEN
He wants to go to Arabia sir

He strolls away from the window towards a chair in front of -
MURRAYs desk the CAMERA TRACKING BACKWARDS with him
into a medium shot of the two of them We now see that DRYDEN is

carrying a copy of the Arabic newspaper

MURRAY

Im aware of that Hes made application
for a posting to Arabia once a month ever
since he got here Very well then the
Arab Bureau comes along and says we
want an Intelligence manin Arabia We
want you to second us a man in Arabia
We think it should be Mr Lawrence Its
an intrigue Dryden and I dont propose to
let an over-weening finicking crass
Lieutenant thumb his nose at his General

Officer Commanding and get away with it

He loosens the collar of his shirt as DRYDEN smiles again and sits
in the chair

DRYDEN
(calmly quizzical)
It doesnt sound as though hed be any
great loss sir

MURRAY
Now dont try that Dryden Theres
a principle involved

27 CLOSE UP DRYDEN

DRYDEN
(suddenly quite sharp -
but still calm)
There is indeed Hes no use here in Cairo
and he might be in Arabia He knows his
stuff sir

28 CLOSE UP MURRAY He is a little put out by the moral tone of
this which though a shade spinsterish is not less authentic for

that He grumbles

e
28 Continued

MURRAY

Knows the books you mean

(books is very

contemptuous)
Ive already sent out Colonel Brighton -
who is a soldier - and if Brighton thinks
we should send them some small arms
then we will What more dyou want

29 MED SHOT

DRYDEN
There would be no question of Lieutenant
Lawrence giving military advice sir -

MURRAY
My God I should hope not

DRYDEN
Its just that the Arab Bureau wants its
own man on the spot sir to

MURRAY
(suspicious)
To what

DRYDEN
To make our own appraisal of the
situation

DRYDEN spreads his hands deprecatingly as he says this as one
who makes an almost childishly small request But his eyes are
ready for conflict - he speaks for the Bureau - and MURRAY is

uneasy This is a conflict which has been brewing for some time

30 CLOSE UP MURRAY He looks away fiddels with a ruler
Blurts out

MURRAY
I may as well tell you It’s my considered
opinion and that of my staff that any time
spent on the Bedouin will be time wasted
Oo Theyre a nation of sheep stealers

31 CLOSE UP DRYDEN He raises and lets fall the newspaper

DRYDEN
They did attack Medina

MURRAY (Off)
And the Turks made mincemeat of them

DRYDEN
We dont know that sir

MURRAY

MURRAY

We know they didnt take it A storm
ina tea-cup Dryden a side-show -

(he broods)
If you want my own opinion this whole
theatre of operations is a side-show
The real wars being-fought against the
Germans not the Turks Not here but on
the Western Front in the trenches

(his eyes glow and we see

for a moment how he longs

to be there organising mass

attacks through mud)
And your Bedouin Army or whatever it
calls itself - would be a side-show of a
side-show

» DRYDEN He is smiling again

DRYDEN
Big things have small beginnings sir

MURRAY
And-does the Arab Bureau want a big
thing in Arabia If they rise against the
Turks does the Bureau think theyre
going to sit down quietly under us when
this wars over

DRYDEN
The Bureau thinks the job of the moment
is to win the war

MURRAY
(flushing walks back
to his desk)
Dont tell me my duty Mr Dryden

i

CLOSE SHOT The door is opened bya STAFF MAJOR Behind
him we see LAWRENCE standing in the outer office He moves
forward as soon as he is announced

MAJOR

LAWRENCE brushes past the MAJOR and walks into the room

LAWRENCE
(cheerfully)
Good morning sir

CLOSE SHOT MURRAY

RRAY
Salute MERA

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE comes to a halt near DRYDEN and
salutes very badly his legs not quite together and throws a side-
long glance at DRYDEN expecting approbation but DRYDEN shakes
his head quickly somewhat to LAWRENCEs surprise

MED SHOT THE GROUP MURRAY has been looking at
LAWRENCE ready to be enraged but with something not unlike
caution but he intercepts the look at DRYDEN and explodes

MURRAY
If youre insubordinate with me Lawrence
Tll put you under arrest

LAWRENCE
(apparently crestfallen)
Its my manner sir

MURRAY
(barks suspicious)
What

LAWRENCE
My manner sir It looks insubordinate
but it isnt really

MURRAY is again baffled by his own lack of imagination and
LAWRENCEs apparent innocence He moves uneasily

MURRAY
All right three Now let me do some

And immediately his attention is back on the papers

DRYDEN

DRYDEN leaves beckoning to LAWRENCE to follow but
LAWRENCE remains He addresses MURRAYs bent head He is

sincere and correspondingly awkward

LAWRENCE
Id like to say sir that Iam grateful for

MURRAY

resentful then is replaced by his habitual protective mockery
THE CAMERA PANS with him as he goes to the door and turns

of the regulation army salute and goes

CLOSE SHOT MURRAY andthe MAJOR Even before the door

Suddenly he cries out in real distress

MURRAY
Oh how can I fight a bloody war without

LAWRENCE
No hes not a bad chap hes a fool
(grins in anticipation)
How did you do it

DRYDEN again avoids him and goes on walking
DRYDEN
You might better ask me why I bothered to
At this LAWRENCE falls into step beside him and although his

words are still flippant his face begins to assume its expression of
stiff and bitter withdrawal

LAWRENCE
Because Im the man for the job

DRYDEN

I just wonder about that

LAWRENCE
Of course Im the man for the job What

different from GENERAL MURRAYS It is elegantly furnished and
carpeted the room of a cultivated xenophile There are pictures of
ancient desert monuments and fragments of carving

LAWRENCE
Good And when Ive found him

DRYDEN
Find out what kind of man he is Find out -
(his gaze wanders somewhat)
what his intentions are I dont mean his
immediate intentions - thats Colonel
Brightons business not yours I mean his
intentions in Arabia altogether

LAWRENCE appreciates the significance of this He walks away a
little and comes to rest with his hand on a fragment of stone

LAWRENCE
Oh thats nice

DRYDEN agrees LAWRENCE puts down the piece of stone

LAWRENCE
Where are they now

DRYDEN
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina
Theyre Hashemite Bedouins they can
cross 60 miles of desert in a day

which frame a secluded hollow of soft multi-coloured sands The

camels are brought to a halt

TAFAS
We will sleep here

The camels are made to kneel and TAFAS dismounts For a moment

LAWRENCE remains in the saddle easing his aching back then
anxious to hide his discomfiture he climbs stiffly out of the saddle

only to find that standing is even more painful
his water skin and brings it to LAWRENCE

LONG SHOT (BINOCULAR EFFECT) A caravan of four camels
moving across the plateau towards the mountains —

CLOSE SHOT TAFAS is looking at them intently ‘but finding

LAWRENCEs regard upon him he gives a quick explanatory grin and

says with the off-handedness of one belittling his own anxiety for
his own comfort

whatever nasty receptacle such a person as TAFAS might use
Silence prevails TAFAS eyes flick intently from time to time to
LAWRENCEs revolver on the pile of LAWRENCEs equipment
(CLOSE SHOT onthis) LAWRENCE from time to time watches the
brisk progression of fat from TAFAS hand to mouth His expression
is in no way disgusted He is wondering if he could do it Absently
he takes up his mug It is empty TAFAS quickly offers his own
which is half full It is rimmed with mutton fat LAWRENCE
gently rejects it TAFAS looks at it for a moment and replaces it
on the ground LAWRENCE disapproves of himself TAFAS
addresses lis jaws to the mutton and his eyes to the revolver

LAWRENCE
Take it

TAFAS

(stops eating and looks

at LAWRENCE As

one who explains the

nature of a commercial

contract)
I take you to Lord Feisal Then you
give it to me

LAWRENCE
(nods to show his
comprehension)
Take it now

He gives the pistol to TAFAS who eyes shining wipes his fingers
on his clothes and takes it reverently as though it were ceramic and
he a connoisseur Wordlessly he thrusts it into his belt He looks
at LAWRENCE with a complex of emotions struggling beneath his
rudimentary features

He takes up his fat and has a brilliant idea He holds it out eagerly
but his smile vanishes as he remembers the incident of the mug He
laughs deprecatingly at the mutton

TAFAS

Bedu food
( and rather sadly

draws it back again)

LAWRENCE thrusts out his hand and takes apiece and puts ‘it in his
mouth watched anxiously by TAFAS There is no comedy and
from the steely concentration of his face we see that the flesh is

indeed mortified

LAWRENCE
Good
TAFAS

out the fat)

LAWRENCE gravely takes some more
DISSOLVE TO

EXTREME LONG SHOT (HELICOPTER) The desert is now a
firm and level plain At first we see nothing but the sweep of the
empty desert then we perceive two tiny moving objects far below -
moving towards the CAMERA The CAMERA begins to descend
towards them and as they increase in size we see two shadows
two camels two RIDERS The CAMERA keeps boring in and we
identify LAWRENCE and TAFAS cantering along at a good clip

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT LAWRENCE is still awkward on his
mount and TAFAS is giving him riding tips as they move along
LAWRENCEs confidence grows and the CAMERA pans and tracks
with him as he urges the camel into a gallop The camel describes
an erratic circle which brings LAWRENCE back alongside TAFAS
LAWRENCE knows he has done well and raises his eyebrows
amused by his own greed for praise

TAFAS
(genuinely approving)
I think we reach Masturah Well - tomorrow

LAWRENCE
Yes

TAFAS
And from Masturah Well to Lord Feisals

MED SHOT (HELICOPTER) The CAMERA pulls back and up as
the canter becomes a gallop - higher and higher - until the tiny
FIGURES now moving away from CAMERA are lost to view

CLOSE SHOT The white hot sun of noon

CLOSE SHOT The parched surface of a mud flat baked by the sun
into a flattened honeycomb

TRACKING CLOSE UP The CAMERA is close on the faces of
LAWRENCE and TAFAS which are outlined against the pattern of
the mud flat which slips by below them LAWRENCEs skin is the
fiery red of the sunburnt European and the folds of his headcloth
and the creases of his skin are powdered with fine dust They ride

in silence

LONG SHOT We see now that the two RIDERS are crossing a long
and ndrrow mud flat enclosed by tail black cliffs of rock

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT TAFAS is again scanning the horizon
before them with narrowed eyes He grunts and points

TAFAS
The Well
(but he is less interested
in this than in whatever else
he is again scanning for)

CLOSE SHOT A brilliant circle of blue sky framed in black
The faces of LAWRENCE and TAF AS appear on the edge of the
circle A bucket hurtlés down towards CAMERA and with a loud
splash breaks the reflection in the still water at the bottom of a

well

MED SHOT The top of the well is situated on the edge of the mud
flat As TAFAS begins to haul up the bucket he glances carefully all
round the horizon LAWRENCE noticing this does the same - but

both drink

TAFAS

LAWRENCE
(with a half-smile)
Its all right

TAFAS

(the idea is new to him

but he looks into his bucket

catches on and with the

patronizing indulgence

proper between two

civilized gentlemen for

the weakness of the primitive)
This is a Harith Well

(with hypocritical regret)
The Harith are a dirty people

(he drinks greedily)

- With another look round the horizon he goes over to a small trough

and pours out the remainder of the water for the camels As the
camels drink LAWRENCE strolls over to a little patch of sand and
lazily sits watching TAFAS as he returns to the well and drops the
bucket into it A splash echoes up from below

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE begins to whistle to himself (The
Man Who Broke the Bank) as he drifts off into a little daydream
The sound of the bucket is heard bumping up the side of the well -
then it stops There is a moments silence followed by a heavy
splash LAWRENCE looks up

CLOSE UP TAFAS is standing stock still looking out over the
mud flat

CLOSE UP LAWRENCE turns to see what he is looking at

LONG SHOT A little dust cloud is approaching at a distance of
about half a mile floating above the mirage

MED SHOT LAWRENCE rises and slowly goes over to TAFAS

They stand together staring out over the flat

He wears a black hooded cloak with a black cloth drawn across his
face

side of his camel raises his pistol and fires

MED SHOT The STRANGER drops to the ground behind his camel
There is another shot TAFAS remains as still as a statue in the

foreground of picture

CLOSE UP LAWRENCE frozen in place numbed by the unexpected
eruption of violence

LONG SHOT The three MEN remain completely still Then
TAFAS gun falls to the ground with a clatter and very slowly he
sags at the knees and crumples into a heap beside it LAWRENCE
runs over to the body

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE stands looking down at the dead man
and then raises his eyes to the mud flat

LONG SHOT The STRANGER rises to his feet reloads his rifle
and mounts his camel

CLOSE UP LAWRENCE goes down on his haunches by TAFAS
keeping his eyes on ALI

MED SHOT LAWRENCE stands with his back to CAMERA in
the foreground of picture In the background the STRANGER rides
slowly towards him and finally comes to a halt on the other side of
the dead man After a glance to make sure that TAFAS is dead he
thrusts his rifle into the saddle holster unwinds his headcloth and
leaps gracefully to the ground He is a handsome young man of
about LAWRENCEs age an impressive figure in both bearing and
costume He picks up the pistol He examines it

ALI -
Is this pistol yours English

LAWRENCE
No his

So ALI stuffs it complacently into his own waistband and approaches
the well followed by his camel He picks up the tin mug which is
lying on the wall of the trough

ALI

LAWRENCE
Yes Why

ALI
This is my well

LAWRENCE
I have drunk from it

ALI

They look at one another Neither of them frightened but in
mutual incomprehension

ALI

He was nothing English

LAWRENCE
Then why kill him

ALI

Yes that

ALI raises his fine eyebrows but politely refrains from comment

LAWRENCE finds himself defending his humanitarian position
which makes him the more angry

LAWRENCE

He was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem The
Beni Salem are blood enemies to the Harith

LAWRENCE

ALI rides out of picture leaving the screen filled with blue sky
Music begins The CAMERA pans downwards revealing a different
location - a barren desert landscape across which LAWRENCE is’
viding leading TAFAS empty camel behind him

DISSOLVE TO

108 EXTREME LONG SHOT LAWRENCE and his two camels have now
entered an area of spectacular and magnificent scenery High red
cliffs tower above sparkling white sand and give the landscape an
atmosphere of incredible grandeur and beauty

109 MED SHOT The CAMERA pans down a great face of rock
following the echo and comes to rest on a CLOSE SHOT of a MAN
dressed in the uniform of a British Colonel He is sitting ona
boulder watching His camel grazes a few yards behind

110 LONG SHOT The distant figures of LAWRENCE and his two
camels from the COLONELs viewpoint

111 CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE hears a parade-ground voice shouting
his name He halts his camel and looks around From the shadow
of the rocks in the far back ground the figure of the COLONEL
now mounted on a camel comes out into the sunlight

DISSOLVE TO

112 MED SHOT The CAMERA pans with the COLONEL as he trots
his camel over to join LAWRENCE He-isvery military but
intelligent and hard-bitten When he speaks it is rapidly as a man
who knows his own mind and has something on it His name is
BRIGHTON He rides up alongside LAWRENCE into a TWOSHOT

BRIGHTON

Yes theyre over there

the head an evident declivity
into which we cannot see
Then as LAWRENCE is
eagerly about to move —
forward he checks him
flatly)

Just one moment Lawrence
(irritably curious his
sense of professional
etiquette is outraged)

Now - who sent you

LAWRENCE
Ive been seconded to the Arab Bureau

BRIGHTON

has explained all)
O-o-oh

BRIGHTON (Cont)

(the exclamation demonstrates

his relief that LAWRENCE is

in-such a weak position as that)
And what are you to do for the Arab Bureau

(a thousand Mess Room jokes

are his authority for this

attitude of patronizing

amusement)

LAWRENCE
(explicitly earnest and
polite in ratio to BRIGHTONs
implicit rudeness)
Its rather vague actually sir Im to
“appreciate the situation

The parody of the Public School subaltern does not go unnoticed
BRIGHTON looks at him cautiously but LAWRENCEs face is

studiously innocent

BRIGHTON

(grunts)
That wont be difficult the situations
bloody awful

(he digs irritably in the

sand with a bit of stick)
Their morale - if they ever had any morale
which I doubt the Turks knocked it out of
them in front of Medina

(the irritation is replaced

by abrooding sadness)
with howitzers Theyre fading away by
dozens every night And what I want to
say to you is this

(he recites with considerable

dignity his simple creed)
Wherever you are and whoever you are with
you are a British Serving Officer And heres
anorder When we get into that camp youll
keep your mouth - shut Dyou understand

stick and preparing to rise)

And then crouched springily on his heels he freezes and breaks off
and the vitality drains from his face The organ note of low flying
aircraft approaches and his eyes are haunted as he utters the trench-

soldiers prayer

BRIGHTON
Oh my God not again

The noise gathers two explosions set the cliffs thundering
BRIGHTON and LAWRENCE rush to control their panic-stricken
animals and look up as

113 LONG SHOT A Turkish bi-plane shoots upwards from behind a
cliff climbing steeply The CAMERA pans with it as it roars
overhead and banks into a sharp turn

114 CLOSE UP BRIGHTON and LAWRENCE turn around as they hear
the sound of a second engine

115 LONG SHOT Another plane roars over the cliff-top

116 CLOSE SHOT The camels buck and rear BRIGHTON gets his
under control then LAWRENCE who is looking up at

shallow dive The CAMERA pans with it until it disappears behind

the cliff

than LAWRENCE - and glaring straight ahead

the bombing run

122 MED SHOT The plane swoops overhead A bomb plummets
downwards

123 MED SHOT A tent disappears inthe flash of an explosion

124 MED SHOT The plane sweeps away ovér a dune Its shadow
races up to meet it on the crest and it vanishes over the top

125 MED SHOT Frightened BEDOUINS stagger against a curtain of
drifting black smoke As it begins to clear a prophet-like

FIGURE mounted on a white horse comes riding out from the darkness

This is FEISAL He rides towards CAMERA against the stream of
MEN and animals wheeling his horse in an effort to calm the panic

He shouts as he rides

FEISAL
Stand and fight

The CAMERA tracks with him as he shakes his rifle at the sky

FEISAL
Fire back at them

126 MED SHOT The first plane now very low comes diving in
over the dune

127 CLOSE SHOT FEISAL raises his rifle

128 MED SHOT A flash of the plane as its machine-gun opens fire

129 CLOSE SHOT FEISAL shoots vainly at the sky as the noise of the
engine deafens him a line of bullets lash the sand behind him and
the black shadow of the plane sweeps over and leaves him before he

can turn to shoot again

its machine gun firing among the panicked BEDOUINS who run in
every direction

The approaching drone of the second plane makes himturn The
machine gun opens fire His horse rears

132 MED SHOT A flash of the plane its gun blazing

133 MEDSHOT The shadow of the plane sweeps across the sand

FEISAL beats his mare into a gallop and flat out his white robes
streaming behind him he chases the dark shadow in a mad and
hopeless race As the plane rapidly draws away he pulls up his
horse

134 CLOSE SHOT Surrounded by swirling dust FEISAL is a noble and
tragic figure as he sits bolt upright on his trembling foam-flecked
mare staring after the plane

135 LONG SHOT ‘The two planes fly away into the distance

136 CLOSE SHOT As the drone of the planes dies away so FEISAL
droops in the saddle In the background the shattered camp stirs to
life MEN and WOMEN run to and fro swiftly loading their belong-
ings onto pack-camels FEISAL is absorbed in his own despair
gazing down at the ground After a few moments he braces himself
as one who prepares to shoulder once again an intolerable burden
He throws back his head and assumes a public face but at once his
gaze is arrested

137 CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE looks down at him from a blank blue
frame with compassion certainly but more with devouring interest

138 CLOSE SHOT FEISAL looks up at him his head slightly tilts
enquiringly

FEISAL

interrogative - no
significance please)

CAMERA tracks behind the upright figure of FEISAL mounted on
his white mare and flanked by his two negro SLAVES and a
STANDARD BEARER

151 CLOSE UP LAWRENCE lowers the compass and marks a position
onthe map Hearing a sudden burst of shouting and laughter he

looks up

152 MED TRACKING SHOT From behind a forest of marching camel

legs an infuriated GOATHERD is shouting at two BOYS in the fore-
ground of picture One of the BOYS is trying to ride a bucking and
protesting ram while the other roaring with laughter is trying to
keep him on The ram eventually throws the RIDER on to the
ground just as the GOATHERD springs out and proceeds to lay about
them both with his stick The BOYS escape among the camels only
to be met by another series of blows from the RIDERS The
CAMERA tracks with them down the line until they finally reach a
peaceful haven beside LAWRENCE For a few paces they march in
silence rubbing their tender backs then with a winning smile
DAUD the tougher of the two looks up at LAWRENCE

and raises his hands in a gesture of prayer

FARRAJ
Please your excellency Just one for two

The CORPORAL relents and throws down a cigarette packet The
BOYS leap on it only to find that it is empty The CORPORAL
laughs There is an exchange of looks between the two BOYS and
the CAMERA drops back with them as they take up a position
immediately behind the CORPORALs camel With the deftness of
long practice FARRAJ daintily lifts the camels tail and DAUD
rams his stick home The camel roars and takes off

159 LONG SHOT SUNSET The new camp has been set up beneath a
protecting ring of smooth rocks and high banks of sand at the edge of

a remote plateau

The smoke of the fires rises straight into the air

andone by one lights appear in the largest and most central of the
Bedouin tents On the heights above the camp the tiny figures of
SENTRIES are silhouetted against the soft glow of the sunset Itis a
scene of great tranquility after the noise and bustle of the previous

sequences

You mean the Navy The Turks have
twelve inch guns at Akaba sir - can you

FEISAL

Twelve inches Yes I can imagine

BRIGHTON

Put that out of your mind sir the Navys

got other things to do

FEISAL
Ah yes Protecting the Suez Canal

BRIGHTON

the obvious)
The one essential sector of this Front is
and must be the Canal You see that sir
surely

FEISAL
I see that the Canal is an essential British
interest It is of little consequence to us

frontation cutting back to BRIGHTON only for the last two beats

BRIGHTON
Now look sir Great Britain is a small
country - much smaller than yours
Small population compared with some
Its small but its great And why -

ALI
Because it has guns

them great

BRIGHTON

Lawrence thatll do
(quick before FEISAL

can speak)
Lieutenant Lawrence is not your Military
Advisor sir

FEISAL
But I should like to hear his opinion

LAWRENCE opens his mouth BRIGHTON jumps down it

BRIGHTON
Goddammit Lawrence from whom do you
take your orders

RECITER
From Lord Feisal in Feisals tent

ALI
Old fool Why turn from him (Brighton)
to him (Lawrence) They are master and
man

FEISAL remains absolutely unmoved maintaining towards LAWRENC
an attitude of polite attention LAWRENCE knows he is crossing the

Rubicon

LAWRENCE
My lord I think I think your Book
is right

(he points to the Koran

FEISAL cocks his head

enquiringly)
The desert is an ocean in which no oar
is dipped And on this ocean the Bedu
go where they please and strike where
they please This is the way the Bedu
has always fought You are famed -
throughout the world for fighting in this
way And this is the way you should
fight now

ALI agrees with every word of this and is rendered trebly suspicious
BRIGHTON can barely comprehend such atrocious insubordination

Rising becomes one poor unit in the
British Army

and suspicion)
What is this to you

‘BRIGHTON
Lawrence do you know that youre a
traitor

FEISAL
No no he is a young man Colonel and
young men are passionate They must
say their say but wiser people must
decide I know you are right

BRIGHTON

Very well sir when shall we move
The sooner the better sir youll lose

They stare at one another They turn and make their separate

ways between the tents
Inside the tent FEISAL and LAWRENCE both stand

FEISAL
Colonel Brighton means to put my men
under European Officers does he not

LAWRENCE
In effect my lord yes

FEISAL
And I must do it for the Turks have
European guns But I fear to do it upon
my soulldo The English have a great
hunger for desolate places Lieutenant I
fear they hunger for Arabia

‘LAWRENCE
Then you must deny it to them

FEISAL
You are an Englishman Are you not
loyal to England

LAWRENCE
(hesitates smiles a
smile of intellectual not
emotive humour)
To England and to other things

But FEISAL will not play the intellectual game though amply
intellectual- for him the question is practical and his expression is
serious as he draws up to LAWRENCE and says thoughifully

FEISAL
To England and Arabia both And is

that possible

closely and considers him

He nods)

FEISAL (Cont)

No Arab loves the desert We love water
and green trees There is nothing in the
desert And no man needs nothing
(His tone changes from the
philosophic to the emotional)
-- or is it that you think we are something
you can play with because we are a little
people a silly people greedy barbarous
and cruel
(LAWRENCE looks
surprised)
But you know Lieutenant in the Arab
city of Cordova were two miles of public
lighting in the streets - when London was
a village

LAWRENCE
Yes you were great

FEISAL
(dryly)
Nine centuries ago

LAWRENCE
(mildly)
Time to be great again my Lord

FEISAL

(stiffly)
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks - my father Mr Lawrence
not the English

(he is suddenly overcome

by melancholy)
But my father is old and I - I long for the
vanished Gardens of Cordova

(sighs)
However before the gardens must come
the fighting

He indicates graciously the tent flap They move over to it and
FEISAL courteously holds it apart

FEISAL nods a polite goodnight and LAWRENCE leaves

164 CLOSE SHOT Outside LAWRENCE comes to a slow halt a few
yards from the tent As he stands looking down at the ground in
deep thought a slow dynamo-like theme begins on the SOUND TRACK
An irritation crosses his mind the music stops and he looks up

165 MED SHOT BRIGHTONs 5 brightly lit army tent glowing out
among its neighbours

166 CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCEs eyes return to the ground and the
music begins again then very slowly he walks off in the opposite

direction

167 MED SHOT FEISAL is sitting alone inside his tent He looks up
towards the tent flap trying to collect his curiously conflicting thoughts
about the young man outside

168 CLOSE SHOT A set of moonlit footprints in clean sand The
dynamo theme takes on an overtone of mysticism as the CAMERA
pans upwards following the footprints and we see the dark outline
of LAWRENCEs back as he strolls slowly in deep thought towards
the open desert

174 MEDIUM SHOT A dawn sky LAWRENCE is standing quite still
oblivious of the two BOYS who squat down only a few yards above him

175 CLOSE UP The IMPS sit patiently watching LAWRENCE like two
dogs watching their master Then DAUD picks up a jagged stone of -
some bright colour and suggests in pantomime that he throw it down
towards LAWRENCE FARRAJ shakes his head but unable to
restrain himself DAUD gently lobs it out of picture

176 MEDIUM SHOT The stone lands at LAWRENCEs feet At first he
seems not to notice it but then without interrupting his concentra-
tion he aimlessly picks up the stone bounces it up and down in the
palm of his hand and walks slowly away The IMPS get up and run
out of picture

DISSOLVE

177 LONG SHOT DAY LAWRENCE is sitting under a stunted desert

tree One of the BOYS sits before him the OTHER is busy behind

him Apart from this tiny group the frame is completely empty
above below and to either side

178 MEDIUM SHOT The SAME FARRAJ is hanging an odd piece of
cloth in the branches so that LAWRENCEs head is shaded Three or
four yards in front of LAWRENCE with his back to camera sits
DAUD - also cross-legged watching him as he continues playing with
the stone FARRAJ comes and sits down near to DAUD so that
LAWRENCE is framed between the backs of the two BOYS The
CAMERA startsto creep in towards LAWRENCE The music
which has never stopped builds up andup LAWRENCE begins to
hold the stone so tightly that his fist vibrates with the unconscious
effort He looks directly up at the two BOYS but his eyes are
focused on the distance and he is not really seeing them

are rather frightened

then looks up in surprise and points to LAWRENCEs hand It is
bleeding LAWRENCE licks his palm mechanically and above his
hand we see his gaze is no longer inwards but outwards and actively
excited He gets to his feet Exciting whirling music begins The
CAMERA PANS and TRACKS with LAWRENCE as he walks away
from the three The two BOYS follow close behind LAWRENCE
walks faster and faster until he is running - as a man runs who has
a specific destination The music builds The camp appears in the
background and the run becomes a race LAWRENCE disappears
among the tents and the BOYS put on a spurt but DAUD trips over a
root and goes sprawling and MUSIC stops when

sure he has been been seen and

190 LONG SHOT The RAIDING PARTY making its last minute
preparations Some of the camels are being loaded some are
already rearing to go the atmosphere is as tense and technical
as in a Grand Prix racing pit except that there is no shouting - on
the contrary all is done very quietly LAWRENCE pauses to take
in the scene and FEISAL steps out of the shelter of the rock

FEISAL
(smiles but rather
faintly and searchingly)
And where are you going Lieutenant -

long muttering)
Yes yes I must But I will spare

these to you

They have arrived at LAWRENCEs camel ALI is by it busy with

his own He looks at LAWRENCE but makes no greeting defensive-

aggressive

FEISAL
Did Ali break confidence to tell me

Before LAWRENCE can answer FEISAL holds up a hand and listens
Quietness falls all about The distant Muezzin is heard from the
camp and with a single wave-like rustling all but LAWRENCE are
kneeling towards Mecca He looks about we see what he sees
then he busies himself quietly with his bags When the prayer is
ended ALI is the first to rise and again he and LAWRENCE
exchange their defensive-aggressive stare FEISAL rises last

LAWRENCE
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance

wistfully

camel which has risen and behind we see ALI and OTHERS
similarly risen

LAWRENCE

Since you do know we can claim
to ride in the name of Feisal of Mecca

FEISAL
(looking upwards from
LAWRENCE s angle)
Yes Lieutenant Lawrence you may
claim it But in whose name do you
ride

CUT SHARPLY with MUSIC quite loud to the head and shoulders

of LAWRENCE riding broad day His expression is that of an

excited young man who nevertheless controls himself As he rides
he slightly turns his head from left to right trying to see what is
behind him without overtly turning round The MUSIC gathers

yet more force Finally he is unable to overcome the temptation and

twists right round in the saddle

MED SHOT What he sees (And with a crash the theme fills to
full pitch) The RAIDING PARTY strung out four abreast behind him

CLOSE UP TRACKING ALI and LAWRENCE LAWRENCE turns
to the front again his eyes blazing He straightens himself in the
saddle and erects his head His face is stiffened with disciplined
ecstasy ALI has been watching him he smiles sardonically

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT The CAMERA now starts to move down
the line of RIDERS introducing each in turn as they pass through
the shot trotting a little faster than the CAMERA First come

ALIs two NEGRO SLAVES magnificent in their red-tipped costumes

Then banners followed by exotic faces fiercely and seriously con-
centrated ahead Last of all come the baggage camels laden with
food and rolled-uptents We see individually GASIM a shifty
cheerful undersized and impoverished Bedouin the ELDER HARITH
a middleaged and well-equipped warrior with a calm strong face
and MAJID a willowy young Ageyli with splendid clothes made-up
eyes and an elegant manner but a dashing rider and most seriously

armed

198 LONG SHOT TRACKING For the first time we see the RAIDING

PARTY as awhole The CAMERA follows it for quite some time
as it weaves its way through the multi-coloured sands and rocks
ALI raises his camel stick pointing out a change of direction away
from CAMERA The MUSIC grows fainter and fainter as the
RAIDERS draw away leaving a cloud of dust behind them

199 MED SHOT Round the corner of a hillock we have just passed a
single and rather mangy camel appears with two RIDERS As the
animal is brought to a halt we recognise FARRAJ and DAUD DAUD
is in front with FARRAJ mounted pillion-fashion behind him his
hands clasped around DAUDs waist The two IMPS furtively watch
the desert ahead

200 LONG SHOT From their viewpoint we see the receding column
of dust sent up by the RAIDING PARTY

201 CLOSE SHOT DAUD and FARRAJ They wait for a few seconds
then DAUD gives their camel a smart whack and CAMERA pans
with them as they trot off across the desert plain

DISSOLVE

202 CLOSE SHOT DAUD and FARRAJ hidden behind a fold in the
ground Late afternoon On their bellies they munch some

unappetizing and crumbly food By their sides we see their water can

not a proper one but improvised from an old tin - empty They are
looking off screen yearningly On SOUND TRACK we hear distant
cheerful voices and the roar of acamel DAUD essays another
mouthful of the dry stuff chewing mechanically and half-heartedly
crumbs falling heedless from his lips he gazes off fascinated at

203 MEDIUM SHOT The glittering water of a palm-fringed oasis The
Raiders (their voices now suddenly loud on SOUND TRACK) are
preparing for the night in high good humour the sadness of parting
over and the hard part of the journey not yet begun The water
occupies most of the screen the men merely a human fringe at its
periphery They drink call to one another drink pour water on
their heads splash dabble their hands or merely smile at their
own reflections A fire is kindled food is in the offing But above
all there is water

204 CLOSE SHOT DAUD and FARRAJ as before looking off (the
‘voices distant again) They look at one another hesitantly Look
off again With determination DAUD seizes the can They slither
down the reverse slope

army singlet crouching watched by ALI who lounges at a little
distance from him LAWRENCE is aware of ALIs regard On

CLOSE MOVING SHOT GASIM is coming through the palm trees
with DAUD and FARRAJ He has DAUD by a handful of his thick
hair and FARRAJ by the ear GASIM is delighted to be the centre

of attention and gives DAUD a rough shake now and then and DAUD
plays up with clowning and affected fear But FARRAJ is in pain and
his dignity offended and has set his face disobligingly The Raiders

- laugh and applaud These are known characters evidently

LAWRENCE and ALI LAWRENCE as before but ALI is standing
GASIM comes on frame and throws down his captives One or two of

the others have followed

GASIM
I caught them Sherif They have tracked
us They were here
(with an ingratiating
nod to LAWRENCE)
I caught them

ALI picks up his camel whip

ALI
Why are you here Boy

He pushes FARRAJ with his foot

FARRAJ
To serve Lord Aurens Sherif

DAUD having improved the moment by surreptitiously snatching a
handful of water nods cheerfully at LAWRENCE ALI looks at
LAWRENCE sardonically LAWRENCE is attracted to the boys but
senses that the situation holds trouble for him He will have no
part of them and looks away as one bored or one who will have no
concern in something no concern of his ‘

GASIM —
(anxious to be indispensable)
That is true Aurens They do wish it

He turns for confirmation to the others but LAWRENCE again looks
away unconcerned and doesnt even seem to hear what follows

ALI

You have been tracking us
(he looks uneasily over the
horizon He twitches his whip)

You were told to stay

FARRAJ
No Sherif our camel strayed We followed her

She led us here to be Lord Aurens servants

LAWRENCE looks up

LAWRENCE
Dont do that

Immediate silence He rises He is hesitating GASIM steps in to
save him from a social blunder
GASIM
Oh these are not servants Aurens - these
are outcasts parentless
(he shrugs not expressing
‘pity but on the contrary
apologising for such creatures)

ALI
(shortly)
Be warned They are not suitable
LAWRENCE

They sound very suitable You can

LAWRENCE opens his mouth to reply but from the Wadi a single
shot cannons out He looks to ALI but after a single split beat’
ALI is gone from the frame with a celerity which indicates that
some specific serious thing has happened

MED LONG SHOT PO V LAWRENCE In the Wadi the BEDOUIN
are on their feet converging on a point where there is a swirling
knot of men and shouting

is leaving the foot of the frame LAWRENCE appears at the
head of it following more slowly

round something we cannotsee of mixed Harith and Howeitat

struggling swings sideways to reveal in a patch of moonlight
ALI AUDA MAJID and two senior HOWEITAT in altercation at
the foot of the Wadi wall LAWRENCE drops into view behind
them

CLOSE SHOT This group AUDA says flatly into ALIs face
not as one who seeks to convince but as one who states an unalter-
able fact

AUDA
He killed He dies

At this the two HOWEITAT murmur approval while ALI and
MAJID can only fall silent and AUDA breaks away (as LAWRENCE
joins the group) followed by his two from one of whom he seizes
a rifle and thrusts his way into the scrum which falls almost silent
opening for him
ALI

This is the end of Akaba

GASIMs smile becomes puzzled Hither LAWRENCE is for him
or against him he thinks Then again he nods his expression
enquiring LAWRENCE raises hispistol GASIM flings himself
away and sideways from his captors who skip nimbly out of line
of fire and at the top of the screen we see the feet of the
HOWEITAT scatter It is ugly scrambling without dignity

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE His face wooden half averted he
fires He takes fresh aim andfires again and again Itis clear

that GASIM is still alive and flinging himself about on the ground

LAWRENCE ‘s face is desperate

shocked not merely with the shock of a horrible experience ‘but
of a man who has just heard horrible news

grimly without panic valiantly to rip the covers from the heavy guns
to lug them to the reverse side of the position to loadthem The
thunder is growing we almost want them to succeed One team does
loose off a brief hesitant burst but the charge bursts on screen thunder

Sinai were the local park and ALIs anxiety comical ‘But seeing
ALIs face he reaches out takes ALI by one of his cross straps and
adds
LAWRENCE
Look Ali

If any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and

told them that weve taken Akaba the Generals

ALI

(quietly but with the bitterness

of frustrated love)
Isee In Cairo you will put off these funny
clothes you will wear trousers and tell
stories of our quaintness and barbarity
And then they will believe you

its end he has a face of stone He pauses then says softly into

ALIs face

a glimpse of a portico belonging to a very big building As the
SHOT begins the DRIVER throws down the tailboard with a crash
FARRAJ struggles out of sleep with a cry of desperate warning

FARRAJ
Daud

LAWRENCE looks as though struck FARRAJ hearing the mental
echo of his own cry looks up sharply and apprehensively at him

CLOSE SHOT THE MOTORCYCLIST stationary from behind
He twists his head (goggles now pushed up to reveal after all an
ordinary English face) to see what his strange charges are doing
now

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE and FARRAJ have dismounted and
address themselves to the steps LAWRENCE keeps one hand on
FARRAJ as though this were the one duty he were sure of

‘CLOSE SHOT DRIVER puzzled touched amused but keeping

sympathy)

and swings himself into the cab

PROVOST SERGEANT

LAWRENCE and FARRAJ obediently turn at the PROVOST
SERGEANTs shout His indignation is softened by amusement
at this bizarre and evidently harmless intrusion

PROVOST SERGEANT
(rising quite kindly)
Where the hell dyou think youre going
Mustapha

MED SHOT LAWRENCE gestures vaguely towards one of the
corridors leading off the patie He is not mickey taking

LAWRENCE
Er were thirsty

The PROVOST SERGEANT approaches staring hard His expression
changes He speaks gently

PROVOST SERGEANT

LAWRENCE
Yes

PROVOST SERGEANT
(taking in his clothes - and
FARRAJ)
Are you going to the Officers bar sir

LAWRENCE
Yes

LAWRENCE turns and goes propelling FARRAJ before him The
PROVOST SERGEANT is shocked and calls after him

PROVOST SERGEANT
You cant take him in there sir

FARRAJ turns round again but LAWRENCE does not appear to have
heard anything

600 MEDSHOT The PROVOST SERGEANT and CORPORALS stare
after them All are astonished and shocked but a certain pleasure
begins to dawn within the PROVOST SERGEANT who can anticipate

601 LONG SHOT THE CLUB A DOZEN OFFICERS seated or standing
at tables the bar itself vacant The OFFICERS are conversing
quietly Among others we see the CLUB SECRETARY from the
billiards sequence In background LAWRENCE and FARRAJ enter
and make towards the bar

One by one the OFFICERS see them and absolute incredulous silénce
’ falls for they look completely Arab Nobody moves The CAMERA

PANS with LAWRENCE and FARRAJ into a CLOSE SHOT as they

come to a standstill in front of the har The Arab BARTENDER

is flung into instantaneous alarm and embarrassment partly on his

own and partly on LAWRENCEs behalf who regards him blankly

BARTENDER
(leaning forward urgently
confiding)
No No You must --- you must -- no --
no-- no-- no
(hissing)
Go Effendi go

He glances nervously at the thunderstruck OFFICERS and raises
his voice officiously

BARTENDER
Get out You must get out Get out

602 CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE and FARRAJ over the BARTENDERs
shoulder with the OFFICERS in the background The BARTENDER
makes a move across picture in order to round the bar but
suddenly LAWRENCE grips him and turns him back into his first
position LAWRENCEs face begins to show some sort of response

to his situation The response is venomousanger He speaks
very clear and Oxford in this silence

LAWRENCE
We want two large glasses of lemonade

BARTENDER
(utterly lost)
This is a bar for British Officers

LAWRENCE
(as one for whom wit is
an unavoidable burden)
Thats all right were not particular

There is a clatter from the background as the SECRETARY gets up
from his chair

SECRETARY
Lawrence

He comes up to LAWRENCE and FARRAJ
Are you off your head

LAWRENCE looks about him at the decent puzzled English faces
uncomprehending and therefore beginning to be indignant Hatred
begins to shine in his eyes The CAMERA begins to track in

LAWRENCE
No oddly enough Im not

One or two more OFFICERS have risento their feet They are
not enraged but displeased and spontaneously disapproving The
little oddity with his self regard and cryptic utterances has really
gone too far with this latest escapade Tolerance must be with-
drawn One of them calls out and others join in overlapping

CAPTAIN
Now look here Lawrence just clear out
will you

THE OTHERS

Yes goon clear out
(in a no-nonsense voice)
Get that boy out of here Lawrence
(peremptory)
Oh go away Lawrence
(wearily)

The SECRETARY places a firm grasp on FARRAJs upper arm says
‘tight-lipped ©

SECRETARY
Well have this one out anyway

LAWRENCE tears the SECRETARYs hand from FARRAJ and flings
it away The physical act triggers a more violent vocal reaction
from the OFFICERS

609 MED SHOT LAWRENCE FARRAJ and SECRETARY in the

foreground at the bar BRIGHTON and the OF FICERS in the back-
ground The overlapping babble ceases and there is an awkward
silence as BRIGHTON walks foward to the bar The SECRETARY
steps back making way for BRIGHTON as he passes him

SECRETARY
- (murmuring with a nice
blend of discreet indignation)
Its Lawrence sir

BRIGHTON stares and stares at LAWRENCE who turns deliberately
away and addresses the BARTENDER

LAWRENCE
(softly)
Lemonade with ice

The BARTENDER jerks into action ‘BRIGHTON goes up to LAWRENCE
and barks

BRIGHTON
Well Explain yourself

Weve taken Akaba

BRIGHTON gives an irritable interrogative grunt The precise
meaning of the words is too outlandish for him to take in

BRIGHTON
Hm

Several OFFICERS have gathered round at a discreet distance
There is a complete silence all round save for the considerable
noise of FARRAJ drinking

LAWRENCE
(to BARTENDER)
He likes your lemonade

The content of LAWRENCEs words is still too unexpected to

be taken in BRIGHTON wrinkles his brow Heis trying to find
out what LAWRENCE can really be meaning for he is sufficiently
sensitive to see that he means something and something serious

BRIGHTON
Taken Akaba Who has

LAWRENCE
We have Our side in the war has The
wogs have We have

605 CLOSE SHOT BRIGHTON looks at LAWRENCE hard and intelli-
7 gently trying to differentiate fact and fantasy

BRIGHTON
You mean the Turks have gone

LAWRENCE

No theyre still there but theyve no boots
(he tries for a more ordinary
tone)

Prisoners sir - we took them prisoners
(but his overworked nerves
must unwind)

The entire garrison --

LAWRENCE (off)
--No thats not true - we killed some of
them - too many really - manage it better

BRIGHTON

LAWRENCE
Yes itis I did it

There is a pause BRIGHTON finds all the OFFICERS looking
at him

(with a flicker of interest)
General Allenby

BRIGHTON
Yes Hes in command now Murrays gone

LAWRENCE
(unwillingly interested not
flippant)
Well thats a step in the right direction

He places his glass on the bar His hand is shaking violently
LAWRENCE

nings of admiration

LAWRENCE

BRIGHTON

Yes

BRIGHTON nods smiling at LAWRENCEs rig expecting him to
enjoy the preposterousness of it but LAWRENCE looks at him
unfathomably His smile fades He cocks his head and frowns
enquiringly

MED SHOT A GROUP OF OFFICERS standing quite still staring
Hold for a moment on the OFFICERS

INTERIOR GENERAL ALLENBYS OFFICE

CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY He is seated at his desk in the office
previously occupied by MURRAY Most of the furniture has been
changed together with pictures and other ornamentation On the
wall behind him hangs a calendar depicting month by month a
bucolic England whichis no longer and probably never was The
office now has an airy atmosphere with everything in apple-pie
order ALLENBY is a footballer burly and fit a gentleman erect
and self-respecting a General Officer who has thoroughly assimi-
lated power shrewd commanding daring and humble He is
reading with quiet concentration a personal dossier His tone is
flat with no trace of comment as if it might be a shopping list

he is checking

ALLENBY
- undisciplined unpunctual untidy

The CAMERA TRACKS and PANS very slowly off ALLENBY towards
the opposite side of his desk In the background we can see seated
DRYDEN (nearest CAMERA) and BRIGHTON

- several languages knowledge of
music literature
(he browses)

The CAMERA comesto rest on a CLOSE SHOT OF LAWRENCE
still in Arab clothes He looks across the desk at ALLENBY
cautiously On the otherwise vacant desk we see three photo-
graphs These are a rubgy team an English gentlewoman with
a discreet dependent face and a single link of pearls and a bonny
child on a New Forest pony in front of a country house

Knowledge of knowledge of

CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY He looks up and it is impossible to
tell from his expression or his voice whether he is satirical

ALLENBY
Youre an interesting man theres no
doubt about it

CLOSE SHOT DRYDEN and BRIGHTON BRIGHTON gives a
quick glance at DRYDEN DRYDEN feels the look but does not
respond

CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY and LAWRENCE ALLENBY closes
the dossier and puts it on the desk Then he speaks not hectoringly
not even sharply but very much in the tone of a good barrister

can

Continued
eliciting facts
ALLENBY
Who told you to take Akaba
LAWRENCE
Nobody
ALLENBY
--- Sir

He says this after a pause and rather quietly without a shade of
personal indignation not insisting on his own rights but gently
indicating that the courtesies are to be observed It shows a
concern not for his own privileges but as it were a fatherly concern
lest LAWRENCE should by his behaviour let himself down

LAWRENCE
am Sir

ALLENBY now turns sideways to LAWRENCE and commences a
sort of forensic examination his tone being light quick and
dispassionate Now the pace goes ding-dong between them

ALLENBY

Then why did you

LAWRENCE
Akabas important

ALLENBY
Why is it important

LAWRENCE
Its the Turkish route to the Canal

ALLENBY
Not any more Theyre coming through
Beersheba

LAWRENCE

Iknow But weve gone forward to Gaza

ALLENBY
True

‘e LAWRENCE
And it will be further behind your right
when you go for Jerusalem

© ALLENBY
Am I going for Jerusalem

LAWRENCE
Yes

ALLENBY considers this for a second or two quite immotile and
) it seems that he might be angry

616 - CLOSE SHOT BRIGHTON and DRYDEN DRYDEN glances at
BRIGHTON who is too pent-up with his own thoughts to notice

617 CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY over LAWRENCE After a moments
consideration ALLENBY smiles gently and quickly and then dis-
missing the smile faces LAWRENCE and leaning forward looks
at him full of keen interest

ALLENBY
Very well Akaba behind my right

the most banal phrase)
-- carry on the good work

LAWRENCE
No thank you sir

ALLENBY

621 CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE over ALLENBY Now we see LAWRENCE
utterly in the grip of his contradictions His face works and he twists
slowly about in his chair as he gropes for words

his hands which are now shaking violently He suddenly becomes
aware of the presence of

CLOSE UP DRYDEN AND BRIGHTON DRYDEN is watching

LAWRENCE He now stands up

ALLENBY
What dyou mean by coming in here dressed

LAWRENCE has thrown himself back in his chair very upright
under this onslaught of calculated vulgarity has retreated right
back into the fastness of his glacial nature His eyes flash con-
temptuously

LAWRENCE
Oh yes sir Entirely

ALLENBY

Let me see that - hat - or whatever it is

He takes the kafia and argyl examining them with apparent interest

He nods a little as though to say that the invitation of such a well

known and popular character will of course make everything acceptable
There is a beaitifully calculated emphasis on Major and the effect

of the speech is to deepen the thunderstruck silence

having just noticed the view through the windows enclosing the sunlit
patio

So youll hold down the Turkish Desert Army

LAWRENCE
Yes

ALLENBY

With a thousand Arabs

CLOSE UP LAWRENCE He commences with enthusiasm and ends
fanatically leaning forward almost as if it were ALLENBY he were
threatening

LAWRENCE

A thousand Arabs means a thousand knives
delivered anywhere day or night It means
a thousand camels that means a thousand
packsof high explosive and a thousand crack
rifles We can cross Arabia while Johnny
Turk s still turning round Ill smash his

- railways and while he’s mending them Ill
smash them somewhere else

LAWRENCE (off)
In thirteen weeks I can have Arabia in chaos

ALLENBY replies with deliberate mildness as one clearing up a
small point of information

ALLENBY
You are going back then

MED SHOT LAWRENCE is given a moments blank pause Then
he laughs and runs over ALLENBY with equivocal self-mocking
charm

There is no response ALLENBY and DRYDEN drink LAWRENCE

realises the indecorum of it He leaves the window but is drawn

REVERSE SHOT Through a foreground of heads we see LAWRENCE —
in LONG SHOT through the glass He stands regarding his onlookers
with the same mocking hopeless and stoical expression which we saw
at the beginning of the film He fingers his Arab garments then

with a quick flip he tivirls the end of his abaya around his right hand
--- as he did in the robing scene --- and walks towards the French
windows The CAMERA PANS and TRACKS across the heads and
backs of the OFFICERS as they change position to watch him coming

between themselves and LAWRENCE as he comes through the windows

CLOSE SHOT BENTLEY

He is sitting in the stern of a long boat leaving in the distance a
small and rusty coastal steamer with one or two dilapidated lighters
about it At his feet are a pair of leather travelling bags Jerking
awkwardly to the motion of the beat (it is a rowing boat we hear the
oars) festooned with camera cases dressed in a light suit and trilby
hat he is an incongruous even absurd figure But he makes no
attempt to be less so He has been in unlikelier situations before and
will again Clutching the gunwhale with one hand he examines the
approaching shore steadily His tough alert and cynically humorous
face is alive with curiosity This shot lasts no longer than is needed
to take it in whereupon

MEDIUM SHOT THE BOAT GROUNDS

The Arab ROWERS skip from it and haul it up the beach a little
BENTLEY superintends the landing of his scanty baggage His
attitude to the Arab is that of neither the sahib nor the humanitarian
but simply of a rather graceless man who wants his bags The two
cases are shouldered by TWO ARABS and he sets off after them up
the beach

MEDIUM LONG SHOT from behind BENTLEY and BEARERS in
FOREGROUND

We see the seaward fringe of the village-town of Akaba among its
scruffy palm trees The same dilapidated buildings as before and
among them a few indolent MEN and donkeys and unoccupied
CHILDREN Butcoming down the beach in the contrary direction
is a file of ragged STEVEDORES bearing handsomely woven camel
bags inlaid boxes and rolled carpets BENTLEYS BEARERS
pause At the end of the file comes SELIM (the RECITER) Without
ceremony ‘Bentleys bags are dumped and his MEN rush to help
quarrelsomely in the stowing of the camel bags etc in the boat
BENTLEY is unruffled by the insult to himself but sharply curious
He accosts SELIM raising his hat

BENTLEY
Scuse me friend Who do these bags
belong to
SELIM looks at him gravely Then

(indicating the baggage)

SELIM
He is my master Iam his servant

BENTLEY nods comprehendingly and lugs a business card from a
pocket In the act of offering it he pauses and with dreadful tact

BENTLEY
Can you read

SELIM flickers him a look of mild surprise Then having read the
card he beckons silently and starts away up the beach BENTLEY

Slim customer very good

(to BENTLEY)
I shall certainly watch out for him

(he considers then says)
You are being very sympathetic
Mr Bentley

BENTLEY

(with that curious sincere

insincerity of the news-

hawk on the job)
Your Highness we Americans were once
a Colonial people We naturally sympathize
with any people anywhere who are struggling
for their freedom

FEISAL doesnt even pretend to consider this as a serious motive

FEISAL
Very gratifying

BENTLEY

(laughs a genuine im-

pulsive laugh of sheer

amusement and

appreciation)
Also my interests are the same as yours

Lawrence though

FEISAL

One figure I can give you from my head
because it never leaves my head Since
starting this campaign four months ago we
have lost thirty-seven wounded one hundred
‘© and fifty-six dead

BENTLEY is scribbling this down but does a horrified double take

You remark the disproportion between
Cc our dead and wounded

BENTLEY
(wondering even awed)
Yes four times as many

That is because those too badly wounded to
bring away we ourselveskill We leave
no wounded for the Turks

You mean

FEISAL

Is that the influence of Major Lawrence

This time FEISALs eyes snap with a direct anger and jealousy

FEISAL
Why should you suppose so

BENTLEY
(a bit thrown at thus
receiving for the first
time the full impact of
Royal personality)
Welll its just I heard in Cairo
that the Major has a horror of bloodshed

FEISAL

That is exactly so With Major Lawrence
mercy isa passion With me itis merely
good manners You may judge which
motive is the more reliable

watch again)

Before I return to the fleshpots which I
shall be very glad to do may I put two
questions to you straight

LAWRENCE
(grins at him)
Id be interested to hear you put a
question straight Mr Bentley

BENTLEY chuckles We should see that LAWRENCE has a sort of
respect for BENTLEYs intelligence and absolute freedom from
principle as BENTLEY is fascinated by LAWRENCEs destructive
scrupulosity Also inthis sequence we should see that BENTLEY
has not stood up at all well to the campaigning his clothes have
become greasy and frayed his skin chapped he needs both a haircut
anda shave Whatever LAWRENCE is wearing by contrast should be
virginally clean

BENTLEY
One What in your opinion do these
people hope to gain from this war

LAWRENCE
(quiet lightly)
They hope to gain their freedom

BENTLEY looks at him cautiously
Freedom

BENTLEY
(scribbling saying
dryly even sadly)
they hope to gain their freedom
Theres one born every minute

Unseen by BENTLEY LAWRENCE freezes at this and looks at him
vehemently

LAWRENCE
Theyre going to get it Mr Bentley Im
going to give it to them

manner firmly)
What is it Major Lawrence that attracts
you personally to the desert

LAWRENCE looks the disreputable figure up and down with ‘insulting
deliberation and says

LAWRENCE
Its clean

BENTLEY lowers his gaze to his own garments He lays down his -
pad and pencil and when he looks up we expect him to be at least
resentful Instead he says ina voice that is dispassionate and
thoughtful

BENTLEY
Well now thats a very illuminating answer
(he takes up his camera
and says invitingly)
May I take one farewell picture

it as loot) He holds it up

wistfully but keenly and without self pity uwon AUDA He takes no

too fixed in their own modes to understand one another his attention
remains on AUDA

Oh now I go home

satisfaction)
They will carry my toys

to collect demolition gear from the car He speaks quietly

LONG SHOT - ANGLING DOWN A railway line stretches gleaming
through a dull grey landscape dull grey clouds approaching from the
horizon A wind moaning and in the wind the ‘melancholy rise and fail
of an Arab pipe Scattered haphazardly on and about the line a GROUP

and without purpose

charge of gun cotton secured with adhesive tape) LAWRENCE watches
him but FARRAJ works confidently and has obviously done it before
MAJID crouching watches him with grudging admiration

CLOSE SHOT ALI looks straight down the line He grunts softly
LAWRENCE joins him in frame Neither shows apprehension nor
even much excitement It is routine

EXTREME LONG SHOT - the plume of steam is barely visible On
SOUND TRACK LAWRENCE says Train Farraj

CLOSE SHOT FARRAJ

FARRAJ
(without excitement)
Ya Aurens

He has finished taping the pilot brick to the rail holds both ends
of the tape which will be used to secure the secondary bricks in
one hand and with the other inserts the plug He looks about and
sees what he wants

CLOSE SHOT A small red painted wooden box lies on a sleeper out
of reach

MEDIUM SHOT MAJID steps over to it picks it up and brings it
back Doing so his foot slips on the edge of a sleeper Swiftly
FARRAJ is on his feet to secure not the man but the box he does

so and for a second they are face to face both holding it startled
then they smile and the MAN lets go FARRAJ takes from the box
one of the half dozen gleaming detcnators slides it carefully into

the plug to see that it fits then with that blend of carelessness and
dexterity which marks the explosives man he slips it into his waist-
band (EXTREME CLOSE SHOT of this I think) ‘and goes on with his
work

MEDIUM SHOT LAWRENCE joins them He collects together a
coil of fuse roll of tape a small waterproof satchel of tcols the red
box and hands them to MAJID saying

LAWRENCE
Hide yourself my friend

EXTREME LONG SHOT The plume of steam though nearer makes
no audible noise at its still great distance

CLOSE SHOT MAJID leaves FARRAJ and LAWRENCE to follow
the others We see that to do so he must plunge into a steep ditch
into which he disappears before scaling the other side

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE having taken over from FARRAJ has
finished taping the secondary bricks Still no urgency

LAWRENCE
Detonator

FARRAJ slips his fingers into his waistband and feels for the detonator
He looks worried LAWRENCE turns still crouching to look down
the line and back at FARRAJ who smiles embarrassedly and searches
further

MEDIUM SHOT MAJID arrives behind the hump This time the

RAIDERS are not poised for an attack There is tension necessarily
but each man crouches in the lee of his mount Only ALI is keeping
watch The PIPER continues fitfully ALI hisses him sharply to
silence and we hear for the first time the distant puff » puff” of

the train

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE AND FARRAJ are searching the ballast
for the detonator FARRAJ the more urgent and less effective as
the more responsible for its loss He rises to his feet and begins
to search his waistband again irritated guilty The TRAIN NOISE

LAWRENCE
(calmly and reassuring)
All right fetch another

FARRAJ crosses the line towards the hump and the ditch he turns

FARRAJ
Pardon Aurens I

LAWRENCE
- (kindly impatience)
Theres plenty of time Fetch another

FARRAJ plunges awkwardly from sight half falling into the ditch
We hear - do we hear - we are not sure - a bang a thud under
the noise of the wind But FARRAJ does not appear All that LAW-

the doorway in a deliberately leisurely fashion and repeats “ his question

This suggestion does not take them by surprise evidently they have
heard of his intention and discussed it

ELDER HARITH
Deraa is garrisoned Will you take twenty

() 120 INTERIOR the working room of the BEYs apartment lamps lit a

ae calmly beautiful sunset sky beyond the window The BEY is sitting
atthe window with his face in his long and sensitive hands motionless
in an attitude of despair A number of COMMON SOLDIERS stand about
the room at attention they might be some different species of creature
from their immaculate commander Facing the table are LAWRENCE
TWO SYRIAN RAGGAMUFFINS absolutely from the depths and a

ability At either side and behind them stand other TURKISH SOLDIERS

All wait

122 CLOSE SHOT - LAWRENCE observes this uncomprehending and fear-
fully

Co 123 MEDIUM SHOT - Suddenly the BEY raises his melancholy face in which
the eyes are burning and from the way in which the SOLDIERS wipe
the grins from their faces and stiffen to attention we see that he is no
laughing matter to them He rises and walks round the table to inspect
the quartette

ie iw) 124 MEDIUM SHOT - The BEY inspects them His attitude is not truculant -
nor even insulting is indeed dignified and almost wistful as though he y
had some distasteful duty to perform which habit had not quite inured

him to He pauses fractionally before each man and his controlled
features faintly register his response The TWO FILTHY SYRIANS j
We each evoke the sort of horrified disgust tone feels for hopelessly ‘
diseased animals and he passes on hardly pausing He considers the
LEBANESE CLERK carefully The CLERK assays a nervous smile

and the BEY passes quickly on He pauses before LAWRENCE and
LAWRENCE microscopically flinches frightened by the evil in the

man and the BEY turns away awkwardly But half way back to his table
he stops and turns

1O Like light the other THREE are hustled from the room leaving
LAWRENCE and the BEY confronting one another where they stand

against the wall The BEY walks up to LAWRENCE The TWO

behind him move a little closer

LAWRENCE swallows and stares fascinated at the BEY

BEY (Cont)
I say you have blue eyes

LAWRENCE
(remembering his part)
Yes Effendi

BEY
Are you Circassian

LAWRENCE
-Yes Effendi

BEY
(nodding)
How old are you

LAWRENCE
Twenty-seven Effendi
(he remembers his part)
I think

He assumes an ingratiating smile He need not bother To the BEY
he is an object not a man of any kind

BEY
You look older you have had a lot of

experience o
(to TURKISH SERGEANT)
It is an interesting face

TURKISH SERGEANT stiffens his attention stupidly The BEY turns
to LAWRENCE His tone is pleading almost has a whine to it but
he istalking for himself alone absorbed in some inner emotional
crisis of his own

BEY

Iam surrounded by cattle He wouldnt know
an interesting face from a sows belly

His face twitches minutely and is still again

Ihave been in Deraa for three and a half
years now If they posted me to the dark

LAWRENCE
No Effendi

He has been too quick For the first time the BEY looks him in the
eyes surprised

BEY
Have you

LAWRENCE does not reply The BEYs eyes film again
No that that would be too lucky

He has a quiet fit of coughing which he screens ‘politely behind his
gloved left fist Before it is quite over he reaches out and very
much as a man opening a parcel rips LAWRENCEs garment from

the shoulder to the waist LAWRENCE starts back instinctjvely into
the TWO TURKS who grasp his arms The THREE OTHERS stand away
from the wall a little as men who will presently be needed The BEY
unwraps his parcel stripping LAWRENCE to the waist and sees his

scar

BEY
Where did you gat that

LAWRENCE
Oh
(grinning helplessly)
It is old Effendi
(in his confusion he says
this almost as if they
wanted to buy it)

QUICK CLOSE SHOT - THE BEY
QUICK CLOSE SHOT --THE TURKS
FLASH SHOT - LAWRENCE lashes out and kicks the BEY in the groin

FLASH SHOT - THE BEY flies onto his back

FLASH SHOT - THE SERGEANT dashes his fist into LAWRENCEs face

CLOSE SHOT - THE BEY getting to his feet he is breathing hard and
in pain but his face is again controlled and dntroverted he hesitates
on the verge of going then says very clearly

BEY
Beat him

He goes through a door near where he has landed carefully leaving
it ajar

(ABOUT WHAT FOLLOWS The material of the incident is violence
there is a danger that it will be seen as nothing else that is that it
will not make its point That is my reason for advocating a somewhat
ritualistic as against a nerve-storming entry to the sequence If it
goes over the top so that the understanding of the audience is
simply swamped we have failed )

attitude is practical not sinister and throughout this sequence
friendly everyday noises float through the window a distant dog
barking and cart going past a greeting called

CLOSE SHOT - the SERGEANT shows the cane to LAWRENCE with a
Significant querying half-smile as much as to say - And how do you
like the prospect of that

CLOSE SHOT - LAWRENCE the specialist in pain is relieved that

unidentified evil has dwindled to such a little thing as this He raises

his eyebrows and directs at the SERGEANT a look of cold contempt
and indifferen¢eas though at some piece of very bad manners

CLOSE SHOT - the SERGEANT is puzzled by a response which in ai
wide experience he has not encountered before He laoks at the cane
as though there might be some flaw in it hitherto unnoticed by himself

Then

MEDIUM SHOT - he looks again at LAWRENCE now quite intrigued

by him One-handed he gently propels him at the end of it and presses
his shoulder so that he sits astride it gripping the edges with his
hands his face expressing a healthy resentment but completeconfidence

MEDIUM SHOT - the SERGEANT nods to the SOLDIERS Four of them

come and with technical skill and some violence - but no superfluous
violénce - seize his wrists and ankles and ‘jerk him face downwards

CLOSE SHOT the bench comes up to meet us

MEDIUM SHOT - in profile LAWRENCE ison the bench One
SOLDIER has his two wrists and sits on the floor facing him his a
feet braced against the legs of the bench pulling on LAWRENCES

arm so that he and LAWRENCE are face to face

CLOSE SHOT - This SOLDIER who has the wooden ‘and rudimentary
features of a domestic animal grins briefly and significantly at
LAWRENCE

CLOSE SHOT - LAWRENCE raises his eyebrows again very donnish
deliberately putting several centuries of superiority and contempt
between himself and the MAN

‘CLOSE SHOT - the MAN looks blankly at LAWRENCE and up again
at the SERGEANT with surprise and almost with alarm

The SERGEANT shrugs braces his legs and raises the cane

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT UP INTO LAWRENCES FACE The

cane whistles down LAWRENCEs eyes darken a little and he
slightly raises his head but these are mere reflexes his expression
remains exactly as before

CLOSE SHOT - the SOLDIER again He looks at LAWRENCE again
puzzled as a man willlook who draws a bucket from a well which he
knows to be full and finds the bucket empty He looks up again at
the SERGEANT

CLOSE SHOT FROM HIS VIEWPOINT The SERGEANT settles ‘him-
self seriously to the job at hand

‘EXTREME CLOSE SHOT UP INTO LAWRENCES FACE The

cane again This time the reflexes are stronger and there is a
hint of surprise and dawning alarm in LAWRENCES eyes

He is leaning against the wall with a handkerchief to his mouth
listening and waiting We hear the cane again and heayy breathing

CLOSE SHOT exterior dusky sunset ALI in the street outside

The open window of the BEYs working room is an orange rectahgle

in the blue-white wall through which the sound of LAWRENCEs torture
comes clearly Apart from a Turkish flag which flutters in the evening
sky it is a house like others in the narrow street the rear perhaps
Opposite the doorway the street widens into a small yard with stables
ALI leans stoically against the wall with his arms folded After two
or three strokes he unfolds his arms restlessly then clasps his hands
determinedly After two or three more he moves away down the
street CAMERA TRACKING before him the sound diminishing

But so soon as it is inaudible he halts straining his ears hesitates
walks back until he can hear it and

MEDIUM SHOT - the door and window Two more strokes and the

noise stops a pause Now the noise of heavy boots muttered
conversation a door shutting A single voice says one phrase
silence No reaction shot of ALI until

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT - he is walking away again but now swiftly
His face is blank (But NOT shocked alarmed outraged)

MEDIUM LONG SHOT - at the end of the street he has come upon a
railway marshalling yard in a wasteland In the sunset the rails are
dark on the glowing ground In the middle distance a stationary shunt-

CAMERA follows the steam up into the sky which changes from red to
dark blue as the steam gives out and the soft hiss ceases

Descending again to ALI we see that it is now fully night and the criss-
cross lines now shine light against the dark a mazein the moonlight

ALI moves back across them (CAMERA tracking him the moons
reflection in the interlacing lines travels with us emphasizing ‘the
equivocation of their changeful directions) to

LONG SHOT POV ALI down the street The door ofthe BEYs room
opens throwinga wedge of light in which four MEN stagger out with
something heavy which they pitch into the stable yard and return

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - LAWRENCE lies on the rubbish heap
Just before the door shuts after them we see as his body slides

downwards what they have done to him

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - his senseless hand dragging through the
rubbish Snow flakes settle We hear soft running footsteps and

CLOSE SHOT - ALI throws himself by his friend He turns °
LAWRENCEs face towards him staring fiercely LAWRENCE
slowly turns his head away

and brass music crashes onto the SOUND TRACK The brassdraws
away revealing itself as a TUBA in full blast blown by an ARMY
BANDSMAN in undress uniform and that this BANDSMAN is one of
some DOZEN all of whom are marching in step blowing lustily They
form the brass section of a MILITARY BAND at practice °

LONG SHOT An improvised parade ground beyond which are the domes
and minarets of Jerusalem The band led by a DRUM MAJOR marches
in the near foreground while iin the background a SMALL FIGURE

in British Officers uniform makes its way across the open space The
DRUM MAJOR signals smartly with his ornamented baton and the band
begins to counter-march

MEDIUM SHOT --TWO or THREE SOLDIERS in collarless shirts
braces and khaki trousers are playing with a football A goal post
has been rigged up by hanging a rope between two pillars The
SOLDIERS on the parade ground are potting at the GOALKEEPER
between the pillars We now see that the figure in British Officers

his shoulders are held awkwardly and his features are more relaxed

LONG SHOT An open courtyard with pillars jasmin and orange
trees Small groups of OFFICERS sit on the low wall among the
greenery One pair plays chess And individual is absorbed in a
book Another group vanishes indoors leaving behind it the sound of
laughter In the centre of the courtyard through which LAWRENCE
is walking is a big Rolls Royce being polished and washed by two
NC0 s in shirtsleeves As LAWRENCE passes these groups he

‘looks at them hot wistfully or pleadingly but pleased to be among

them unaware that his uniform is a totally inadequate disguise
for his inborn strangeness that he is set apart at a glance One of
the CHESS PLAYERS - who are in the foreground of picture - looks

- up recognises him and draws the attention of the other to him with

some excitement Evidently he has a reputation LAWRENCE

has seen the look and acknowledges it with a half smile The band

pastoral The CAMERA PANS with LAWRENCE and we see doors

He nearly bumps into LAWRENCE who essays a brief nod and
smile (quite dignified not sychophantic) but the SERGEANT in the
manner of busy clerical men is too preoccupied to respond as he
makes of briskly towards the other side of the courtyard We hear
the incredible tones of the English upper-middle-class on the

LAWRENCE passes swiftly through with a friendly wave
CENTRES on BRIGHTON From the sympathetic warmth of tone and
the keenness with which he regards him we see that LAWRENCEs
behavior has already aroused anxiety He follows LAWRENCE with his
eyes There is the SOUND of a door opening

CLOSE SHOT - the door (From inside ALLENBYs room)
LAWRENCE enters He stops short his face blank The English
theme ends abruptly on a barbaric dissonance of cymbals

MEDIUM SHOT -a figure in full Arab regalia is more or less
silhouetted against an open archway letting out on to a sunny terrace
over-looking a garden As thereverberations of the cymbals die
away this figure turns and we see it is FEISAL and that ALLENBY
and DRYDEN are also present The CAMERA PANS with FEISAL as

he walks towards LAWRENCE smiling courteously

ALLENBY

BRIGHTON s office

DRYDEN

ALLENBY takes LAWRENCE by the arm and propels him towards

face to check his condition
seriously)
Well tell me whats happened

They go through on to the TERRACE where there are chairs
a small table drinks magazines and newspapers

MEDIUM SHOT The ORDERLY ROOM BENTLEY watched
contemptuously by the RSM and ORDERLIES is trying quite

openly and indifferent to their opinion to hear at the door of

BRIGHTONS OFFICE This is opened suddenly by DRYDEN

His faceis shocked and gloomy and he takes no more notice of

BENTLEY than if he were a waste paper basket

CLOSE SHOT DRYDEN and BENTLEY in the foreground
BRIGHTON seen through the open door in the background He is
staring at DRYDEN shocked and anxious

BENTLEY

the formalities of
discretion)
Ah come on

DRYDEN
(with an exaggerated
insouciance which isnt
meant to be believed)
No really nothing at all

BENTLEY
Is the man in trouble

DRYDEN
(BENTLEYs question has
come near the quick of his
feelings his face is a shade
less bland as he murmurs
lightly)
Oh I expect so Were all in trouble Life’
a vale of troubles

BENTLEY overtakes him round a desk and bars his way adopting
a coaxing tone of voice to mitigate the offensiveness of it but not

budging

BENTLEY
Just tell me if the mans in trouble Ive
got an interest in the man Ive got a claim

‘DRYDEN
(cold contemptuous
and sharp)
What claim

BENTLEY

(deprecating shrug)
Youve read my stuff -- Ive made that boy
a hero

a righteous claim)
When the wars over that boy can be anything
he wants

DRYDEN
(trying to side-step BENTLEY
who foils him)
Yes well at the moment he wants to be

somebody else
(suddenly incensed)

Will you kindly allow me to pass

BENTLEY does so but lounging deliberately speaks deliberately
after him

BENTLEY
Walk away Dryden walk away Always
walking away arent you

DRYDEN

(at the door caught

unprepared for the

penetration of this

frowns a little hesitates)
Well Ill tell you Its a little clash of temp-
eraments thats going on in there Inevitably
One of thems half mad

there but adds)
‘And the other -- wholly unscrupulous

LAWRENCE

ALLENBY
Oh yes And here’s another thing When
you ask for common humanity” youre crying
for the moon Common humanitys the one
thing you cant have

LAWRENCE

There is for one man every hundred years
or so
LAWRENCE

just see the poison beginning
to work)
Me
ALLENBY

(taking off his jacket)
Yes 1 think so

(Again he is careful to keep his voice matter-of-fact as though this
were some small technical judgement he had just made )

ALLENBY puts his jacket over the back of an empty chair and

from this point on he adopts the tone used between equals and friends
and friends of such long standing that they can even afford to be
brusque He regards his jacket chucklinga little ruefully

ALLENBY
Isnt that funny I feel quite naked

Youre a leader

Theres nothing you can do about it

ALLENBY sits and seems totally preoccupied with the condition of
his cigar LAWRENCE does not answer but looks at him suspicious
flattered comforted above all longing to accept the paternal embrace

that seems to be offered

ALLENBY
(quite idly)
You write poems dont you
LAWRENCE
Yes
ALLENBY
Any good
LAWRENCE
No Bad
ALLENBY
(nods sympathetically)
Hard luck

LAWRENCE is a little amused and quite surprised by the degree
of understanding ALLENBY assumes

LAWRENCE
Its not a matter of luck

ALLENBY

‘Course it is
(he settles back

comfortably)
I grow dahlias myself

Apparently on impulse he takes from the table a photo of his house
and offspring He peers at it pointing out a patch of cabbagy flowers
in the background
ALLENBY
There
TI-73

Together they study the photo ALLENBY never looks once at his
victim seems innocently absorbed in the subject of the conversation

He pauses as he replaces the photo and smiles

ALLENBY
Thats my lad You must come and see us

afterwards

LAWRENCE
(he hesitates cautiously
but says)
Id like to

And it is almost like a physical object he has handed to ALLENBY --
the keys of his citadel

ALLENBY

Ive got good soil good compost I buy
good plants Andim a conscientious
gardener ButI dont have the luck to
be a good one So

(he grins)
Im a gardening sort of general Most
generals are But there have been poet
generals Xenophon was one Hannibal
Nelson was the last I think youre

another

LAWRENCE
(his tone sceptical
put his smile tremulous
and reproachful)

Nelson and me

He is asking ALLENBY to be merciful

from him)

LAWRENCE

No

ALLENBY
(in his cunning adopts a
tone of irritation)
Look Lawrence Ive taken those things

off --

(rubs his shoulder)
- and I dont feel happy without them
I believe your name will be a household
word when youd have to go to the War
Museum to find who Allenby was

His voice now becomes

low confidential but very steady it is temptation incarnate

204 CLOSE UP LAWRENCE

ALLENBY (off)
You are the most extraordinary man I
ever met

LAWRENCE

CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY over LAWRENCE After a pause ALLENBY
shrugs and the CAMERA PANS with him as he rises and moves away
with feigned hostility turning his back looking out over the garden

the very image of a disappointed father

ALLENBY
Thats a feeble thing to say No wonder
your poetrys bad ©

CLOSE UP LAWRENCE looks at ALLENBYs back longingly He
hesitates and is lost He prevaricates

LAWRENCE
I know Im not ordinary

ALLENBY (off)
(short)
Thats not what Im saying

Suddenly LAWRENCEs immobility flies apart He is thrown about
in his chair by muscular stresses - much as a man might respond
to a thumbscrew -- and he cries out

LAWRENCE
All right Im extraordinary Im
extraordinary

His tone in saying this is as though he were saying All right Ive
got cancer A tone of desperate lament But then abruptly having
accepted it he freezes again and looking at ‘ALLENBY he says in

a very different tone quietly mocking from a superior knowledge

LAWRENCE
What of it

CLOSE UP ALLENBY He is now looking at LAWRENCE but has
not yet caught the reversal of their positions

ALLENBY
(gravely and kindly)
Not many people have a destiny Lawrence
A terrible thing for a man to funk it

paces along the terrace where he stands in an archway his back to

LAWRENCE

LONG SHOT Angling down the ARAB ARMY ASSEMBLED They are
in two long lines very well ordered In front of their men the
Sheiks either sit ‘their beasts or stand beside them ready to mount
their Standard Bearers behind them The camels are kneeling their
riders ready The HORSEMAN nearest CAMERA look off (past
CAMERA) stiffens standing in his stirrups He raises his voice in

a shrill cry

EXTREME LONG SHOT Over the level land something is approaching

LONG SHOT Angling down the Army as before With murmurous
excitement camels rear up horsemen mount all together so that

the whole line rises in one movement At the far end of the corridor
formed by the lines are two isolated horsemen and a van with a

man on the roof drives out and joins them (About this van it is

a civilian not an army vehicle - something Bentley has begged
borrowed or stolen I would even say it should have lettering TI
Mkapolous and Son Gordon St Alexandria Finest Fresh Breads

are not offering magnificence in lieu of a properly controlled finale
like a Charlton Heston Sampson and Delilah that we the film-makers
do not take it at face value Bentley is the vitalizing point of disturb-
ance in this epic atmosphere which he will enrich not destroy if we
use him bodily Nothing like a streak of low comedy running through
a scene of high drama - vide the late William Shakespeare )

as he progresses) They ride tightly bunched not filling the screen
LAWRENCE is at the head but definitely one of them not removed
He is mounted on a magnificent white camel outrageously caparisoned
though he himself is still all white His expression is exalted this we
have seen before But it is also unwittingly desperate - he is not fully —
aware of himself imperfectly in control of himself and this we have
not seen before The BODYGUARD ride beautifully every man an
expert LAWRENCE turns his eyes from side to side taking in the
Army but the BODYGUARD keep” their brutalized faces immobile
save perhaps for a faint suggestion of a sneer a secret rather nasty
joke They are contemptuous of all this merely legitmate might
Outsiders who have sold themselves to LAWRENCE they concern
themselves with him only They are all of a kind They are superbly
dressed armed to the tetth

TRACK SHOT Along the face of the ARAB ARMY We now see that
behind and among the Tribesmen are men of a different kind mounted
on mules even donkeys some very poorly dressed in literal black
rags one or two doubled up on rangy farm camels But all have rifles
and bandoliers - British Arm Webbing in the case of the poorer All
are in a state of wild excitement but we now pass a Sheik sitting his
horse before his men and as he sees LAWRENCEs party

PANNING SHOT LAWRENCE and BODYGUARD P0OV the SHEIK
As for 224 The SHEIK looks horrified bewildered alarmed in
contrast to the open mouths staring eyes and wildly flapping arms
behind him

same reaction

As for 223 and 227 LAWRENCE and BODYGUARD
As for 224 and 228 TRACKING ANOTHER SHEIK with the same

three SHEIKS But bewilderment and alarm give way to indignation He
whips his horse and takes off down the corridor

LAWRENCE and his BODYGUARD half way up the corridor now with
the adulation at its climax are joined by ALI

What is this

LAWRENCE
This is my Bodyguard

aristocrat then turning back

ALI

There is not a man there without a price

LAWRENCE
(quite quietly)

Theres a price on my head too

ALI

But these are murderers Do you know the

Sheiks will hang these men

You have bought these things

LAWRENCE

cut deeper)
I bought half the men here Ali

ALI

(uncomfortable he would

prefer to have done without

them though he knows they

are needed)
That is different

(gesturing to BODYGUARD hotly)
These are not ordinary men -

He means they are monsters but LAWRENCE chooses tomisunderstand him

interrupting heavily

LAWRENCE
I dont want ordinary men

And he comes down heavily on the phrase awakening echoes of Second
Azrak and Corruption scenes He whips up his mount and the BODY-
GUARD surge after him leaving ALI to pull his way out of it as best
he can He looks after them full of foreboding The Tribesmen fall
more quiet wondering what LAWRENCE will do

face dark not with anger or foreboding but incomprehension

simply raises his stick and increases his pace to a gallop crying

LAWRENCE
Damascus

It catches the assembled Tribesmen unprepared then in one beat they
roar and spur after him the swifter to the fore

van eagerly taking pictures of the motley units of the Army as they
pour past him ALI reins alongside looking down sternly BENTLEY

maybe from the wildly individual horde of the Arab Army Faces

are fair hair is golden uniforms bleached and laundered There
must inevitably be sweat and dust but this is the merest film upon

the halls through which they pass He has an exact half of ALLENBYs
attention BRIGHTON has the other Trestle tables and chairs are
carried in one after another papers typewriters and files are placed
and ordered by a host of Clerical NC0s while Signalmen swiftly
unwind spools of telephone cable in contrary directions Their many

voices and the banging and slapping of their equipment (though purposeft

BRIGHTON is talking urgently a rhubarb speech which we cannot
hear except the underlined words

THE COUNCIL CHAMBER of the Town Hall Pandemonium reigns
Some two dozen of the leading SHEIKS are seated (or standing) at a
long mahogany table At its head the principal chair --- almost a
throne -- is unoccupied On one side of it is LAWRENCEs place
on the other ALIs AUDA is by LAWRENCE The others range
down the table and their rifles make a small arsenal down its beautifully
polished surface Absurdly ink stands paper and pens have been
placed along it but these are now pushed away and scattered City
dignitaries in European clothes and the Turkish fez look down from
the walls At the foot of the table on bentwood chairs brought in for
the occasion are one or two SYRIANS in pale suits with stiff winged
collars One or two of the SHEIKS look grave one or two uneasy
most are in a mood of total excitement and uncontrol Round them are
ranged their individual BODYGUARDS --- say three or four to each
SHEIK --- armed to the teeth and ready to back their masters with
blows bullets or as now merely with noise At the moment the
SHEIKS are in two factions leaning across the table or towards each
other on the same side shouting fiercely Some of LAWRENCEs own
BODYGUARD are by the door which trembles now and then under pressur
from without LAWRENCE is seated staring at the table with a
premonition of defeat AUDA beside himself with rage is standing
yelling into ALIs face ALI is seated his face grim with foreboding
and the effort of self control We cannot hear what AUDA says except-
Howeitat and repeatedly Harith’ LAWRENCE looks up girds
himself rises ‘suddenly and pounds the table with the butt of his pistol
leaving ‘dents in the surface He goes on looking fiercely at the
SHEIKS until (the graver souls pulling the others into their seats) they

are sufficiently silent and mostly seated

LAWRENCE
We here are neither Harith nor Howeitat
nor any other tribe but Arabs of the Arab
Council acting for Prince Feisal

This momentarily calms all with the parcial exception of AUDA who
glaring at ALI says

AUDA
He insulted me

An ominous murmur from Howeitat supporters

LAWRENCE
(patiently)
Sherif Ali said that the telephones are
in the care of the Howeitat and that the
telephones have ceased to work And
this is true Auda

grips his wrist

LAWRENCE

filled with unease and depression

pityingly)

They are of incredible size but helpless

WHITE HAIRED SHEIK

It is so with all machines

ANOTHER

A chorus of agreement not excited this time but deep and philosophic
LAWRENCE rises pounding the table again breaks in crying out
desperately

LAWRENCE
The need is absolute

ALI
Then we need the English engineers

LAWRENCE
No Take English engineers and you take
English Government Take ---

The door bursts open and a dishevelled SHEIK and SYRIAN burst in

a MAN steps silently and grasps him by the arm He instinctively
recoils but finds himself gripped

AUDA
(After a moment’s silence
Accusing)
He is your friend

At this ALI immediately sets off down the corridor his face averted

ALI
Take your hand away

AUDA
(Ignoring this)
You love him

ALI
No I fear him

AUDAs face is angled so that we can see it ALIs face is in the
shadow of his headcloth save for bright lights on his eyes AUDA
peers a little

AUDA
Then why do you weep

This is said certainly not as a sneer and certainly not with womanish
sympathy but as men speak of weeping naturally whose virility is far
beyond question There is a moment or two of silence before ALI can
reply

ALI
If I fear him who love him
How must he fear himself who hates
himself
(Suddenly all the emotion
comes pouring through
and ALI shouts furiously)
Take your hand away

ALI wrenches himself free with a cat-like bound simultaneously
drawing his dagger which (CLOSE SHOT) carves a bright arc in the
gloom —

AUDA has made the minimum necessary movement to avoid the blow
instinctively and now regards ALI unruffled and even pleased He
is leaning one hand against the wall

AUDA

ALI is sheathing his knife but looks up at this and says determinedly

ALI
Not yet

They have come to an open archway CUT to the courtyard

ALI is crossing it diagonally towards a far corner where among the
shadows is another archway

CLOSE SHOT AUDA his face turned up to the moon and stars
AUDA
Well these are new tricks
(Complacently)
and I am an old dog
He stretches luxuriously and breathes in the open air

AUDA
Allah be thanked

He lowers his head and watches ALI who is entering the shadows and
calls

I tell thee what though

REVERSE SHOT ALI in the shadows turns back towards AUDA
AUDA is calling under the stars

COLONEL
In all my years as a Medical Officer
Ive never seen anything like it

397 MEDIUM SHOT ALLENBY confronts him He has just risen from
bed and is wrapping on his dressing gown We see that he expects
immediate action It is broad morning

ALLENBY
It comes within the jurisdiction of
the Arab Council

COLONEL
Im sorry sir Under the circumstances
I think I must take over immediately

ALLENBY °
(almost automatically)
Under any circumstances at all you must
obey your orders

COLONEL
No sir I will not

ALLENBY
(not angered by the insubordination
irritated by the excess emotion’ Contemptuously)
Control yourself
(Then)
Now go over to the Town Hall and see
what they say

LAWRENCE
(as one who offers
useless exculpation)
We did what we could in the civic hospitals

COLONEL
But you forgot the Turkish Military
Hospital

LAWRENCE

(fearfully)
Are there many

Yes

COLONEL
It has six hundred beds There are about
two thousand Turkish wounded init All
of whom are the responsibility of your
precious Arab Council and many of whom
are your responsibility inmore ways than
that I understand

LAWRENCE
(cannot look at him)
Yes

Sad MUSIC begins and he rises Then as one who fears the answer
to his question he asks

Whats it like

MEDIUM LONG SHOT MUSIC CONTINUING The courtyard of
the Turkish Military Hospital The beds are overflowed into the
courtyard Here and there tarpaulin awnings have been rigged but
one of these over the hospital entrance has come loose at one
corner and flaps heavily and slowly with a soft insidious sound

REVERSE SHOT From under this flapping awning We hear it
and the horrible buzzing of flies LAWRENCE has entered the
courtyard at the far side

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT Maving with LAWRENCE among the
patients Some are dead They are unwashed their bandages
are blood caked dirty dressings and enamel containers lie strewn

MEDIUM SHOT Having tracked with LAWRENCE to the awning and
the entrance we pause with him Voices croak Water Water
monotonously The Turkish word is used so that we do not
understand it until LAWRENCE coming to snatches up an enamel
water jug and darts into the hospital

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT He searches frantically down a corridor
also littered with patients catching glimpses inside wards of their
contents He comes to a dispensary and darts in Frantically he
turns atap The MUSIC rising hopefully

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT THE TAP No water is in it MUSIC
dies away to silence

CLOSE SHOT He puts down the jug He leans back against the
dispensary shelves His wandering eye lights upon a broom He
picks it up and as he does sc we hear cars drawing up doors
slamming and crisp voices shouting instructions

MEDIUM LONG SHOT THE COURTYARD Army ambulances are
drawing up and drawn up MEDICAL OFFICERS NURSING SISTERS
and ORDERLIES are fanning out between the beds Stretchers are
being unloaded Already we can see SIX DOCTORS a DOZEN
SISTERS and a SCORE OF ORDERLIES They are clean starched and
competent It is like a vision of heaven

MEDIUM LONG SHOT ANGLING DOWN A WARD LAWRENCE in
foreground is studiously sweeping between the bunks A moustached
and very military MO attended by TWO ORDERLIES marches up the
long ward He stops at LAWRENCE He is the Captain of the Prep
School the Chairman of the Golf Club His face is crimson He is
enormous and fleshy

MEDICAL OFFICER
This is is outrageous
(he is enjoying it)
Outrageous Outrageous
(he comes up to LAWRENCE)
Outrageous

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE The pale ghost of his old mockery
haunts his features once again He begins to laugh The MEDICAL
OFFICER stares incredulously then deals him such a full-armed
smack across his face as flings him from his feet against the wall

MEDICAL OFFICER
(carelessly as he strides out)
Filthy little wog

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE crouched against the wall continues to
laugh (And let there be no mistake but that it is laughter though
it may remind one of tears The only thing no audience could
possibly accept from this strange man - particularly at this point --
is a) pity Which would also quite ruinously explain his state of
mind

QUICK DISSOLVE

CLOSE SHOT FEISAL in all the panoply of an Arabian King is
speaking melodiously persuasively gently and humorously As
he speaks CAMERA DRAWS AWAY to reveal that he is in
‘ALLENBYs great room in Damascus This is his prestige room
not his working office polished furniture royal portraits the full
treatment ALLENBY is seated at an enormous and useless desk
Behind and to one side of him DRYDEN is seated regarding his
clasped hands behind again BRIGHTON stands looking as is
ALLENBY towards the object of FEISALs discourse whom we cannot
yet see

FEISAL-
My friend Lawrence if I may call him
‘that -- my friend Lawrence -- how many
men will claim the right to use that phrase
how proudly He longs for the greenness of
his native land He pines for the Gothic
cottages of -- Surrey is it not
(he smiles a little at ‘his
own pretentions to be
familiar with all that)
Already in imagination he catches trout
and all the activities of the English
gentleman

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE looks silently back at him
without judgment without even distaste almost as though he had

only just met him Now and henceforth 90 of LAWRENCEs energy

is taken in merely sustaining the burden of his own nature leaving
only 10 for dealings with the outer world He listens carefully and
politely to everything and reacts to nothing And this is not a posture
put a necessary economy to which he is committed Any suggestion of
attitudenising would be very distasteful at this point He is indeed con-
cerned not to be any kind of nuisance It is simply that attention and
elementary good manners are all that he can possibly manage
ALLENBY coughs uncomfortably in the silence

ALLENBY

polite interest not aggressively)

Take the honour Colonel Be a little kind

ALLENBY

LAWRENCE

Then thank you

There is another awkward pause ALLENBY aligns some papers
Then he forces himself to look at LAWRENCE chin out and says

ruthlessly

ALLENBY
Well then God speed

FEISAL cuts in with quick persuasion

FEISAL
There is nothing further for a warrior
here
(unreal self-deprecation)
We drive bargains

LAWRENCE looks at him without anger without condemnation
without comment of any kind FEISAL is touched with the desire to

comfort and adds more sincerely

hope for the future And then old men

are the vices of old men -- mistrust

It must be so

LAWRENCE simply gets up He pauses momentarily wondering what
to do with his cap or what to say that will get him out of the room
Quietly the others have risen also Tongue-tied He goes to the
door and is awkwardly half way through it when he is arrested by

FEISAL
(in a different voice
low and quick not
looking at him)
What I owe you is beyond evaluation

LAWRENCE completes the closing of the door

CLOSE SHOT BRIGHTON looks after him concerned Concerned
for the man concerned that no more has been made of the occasion
On SOUND TRACK we hear “a clearing of throats and scraping of chairs
as the others reseat themselves

FEISAL
The Power House the Telephone
Exchange these Iconcede The Pumping
Plant I must retain

BRIGHTON looks at him horrified and indignant They face one
another across the desk like a pair of bargaining peasants

‘ALLENBY
If you retain the Pumping Plant there
will be no water sir

FEISAL
I shall be glad of any technical
assistance

ALLENBY
In fairness then you must bring down your
Flag

FEISAL
I shall not bring down my Flag And if
your men attempt it my men will resist it

ALLENBY
Have you any men sir

FEISAL
Enough for that It is the kind of thing
that makes a very ugly incident Iam
sure your Government does not wish to
appear at the Peace Conference in the
light of an aggressor It is widely known
the Arab Council took power in my name

ALLENBY
(impatiently)
They have no power sir It’s illusory

FEISAL
Illusions can be very powerful Particularly
when they take this form

He rises and lets drop a pile of newspapers on ALLENBYs desk

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT THE NEWSPAPERS They are in
several languages The top one is the Chicago Daily Courier
and there is a reproduction of the photograph taken by BENTLEY
after the blood-bath On SOUND TRACK

(on SOUND TRACK)
The world is delighted with the picture of
Damascus liberated by the Arab Army

LAWRENCE turns and flinches when he sees who itis The

MEDICAL OFFICER advances on him

MEDICAL OFFICER

LAWRENCE nods

He does so chuckling apologetically without help from LAWRENCE
Then he steps back at attention and says with manly fervour

LAWRENCE is going and then turns back to say not lightly but
with deep and serious curiosity

LAWRENCE

THE ROAD from Damascus in the after-glow of sunset It is a level

desert CAMERA is in rear of a travelling staff car In the front

and the engine An Army lorry passes us in the opposite direction

going in the same direction

CLOSE SHOT LAWRENCE He stands and peers up hopefully
into their faces as the car crawls past

MEDIUM TRACKING SHOT POV LAWRENCE Their faces
They show no sign of recognition We hear the car accelerating
and accelerating we leave them behind in our dust

been addressed)
‘Mm

LAWRENCE does not answer by word or expression The level
desert swings endlessly past us A second Army lorry approaches
and swings past us full of Tommies singing a music-hall ditty of
the period (Goodbye Dolly I must leave you) The sound of
their singing disappears swiftly behind us and immediately an Army
Dispatch Rider on a motor bicycle passes in the same direction

We glimpse the RIDER and the screen is enveloped in the dust which
his machine throws upwards
