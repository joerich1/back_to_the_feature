INT JACKS OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Pete and Lisa sit gingerly on the edge of the couch
Workmen work behind them

Jack sits at his desk which has a lot of exposed wires
hanging over it Nearby we see the legs of a workman on
a ladder

PETE
Im surprised youre renovating This is
such a nice office

JACK
It’s a great office But sometimes you
have to change things that are perfectly
good just to make them your own

Pete and Lisa look a little worried

Jacks nerdy MALE ASSISTANT appears and hands Jack a note
written on a post-it

JACK (CONTD)
Ill call her back Is she at the White
House number

Assistant nods He hands him another post-it

JACK (CONTD)
Tell them I need a 4 am tee time

He hands him another post-it

JACK (CONTD)
About five inches but its thick

Pete and Lisa look at each other

As he exits the assistant gets a little shock to the
head from a dangling wire and flinches slightly Jack
turns his attention to Pete and Lisa

JACK (CONTD)
Are you familiar with the award-winning
GE Tri-vection oven

LISA
I dont cook very much

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
JACK
Sure I got you New York third wave
feminist College-educated Single and
pretending to be happy about it Over-
scheduled under-sexed You buy any
magazine that says healthy body image
on the cover but your kitchens got
nothing but Snackwells and expired
yogurts You reject traditional female
roles but every two years you take up
knitting for a week

PETE
(impressed)
Thats dead on

LISA
Are you gonna guess my weight now

JACK
You don’t want me to do that

PETE

do you do that

JACK
Market research my friend Years and
years of market research that lead to

my greatest triumph the Tri-vection
oven

PETE
My wife wants one of those

The assistant reappears Another post-it to read

JACK

(to the assistant)
Yes but Ill need my kevlar vest

(back to Pete and Lisa with a

smile)
The Trivection oven cooks perfect food
five times faster than a conventional
oven because it uses three kinds of
heat thermal technology for consistent
temperature GE Precise Air™ convection
technology for optimal air circulation
and microwave technology for
unbelievable speed With three kinds of
heat you can cook a turkey in 22
minutes

Would you like me to review for you
everything you’ve done wrong so far
Youve hired a guy so crazy that nobody
else in the world will work with him
right now You brought him in here
without even talking to Jenna first
which will send her into a two-year
spiral You’re putting him in my hands
knowing I don’t want him here You gave
my greedy insatiable writing staff every
toy they asked for which only means they
will have a longer list of things they
want tomorrow Don’t stop feeding those
deer Mr Donaghy or they will turn on
you

JACK
Youll make it work

LISA
What makes you think that

JACK
Cause your friend Jenna’s got nowhere
else to go Youll be nice to Lawrence
cause it’s not his fault And you’ll
focus all your rage and hatred on me
