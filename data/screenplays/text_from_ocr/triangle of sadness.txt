INT CASTING AGENCY WAITING ROOM - DAY

About fifty half naked men are lined up in a room The queue
leads towards an entrance to an adjoining room that has a
handwritten “Maybe” sign next to it Suddenly we hear voices
and the men start to look further back along the line

The “Fashion TV profile” LEWIS TAYLOR comes into the frame
He’s 25 high-energy intelligent and blatantly homosexual
Accompanied by a camera operator Lewis extends a mic in the
direction of one young man The camera operator moves in the
lens is uncomfortably close to the model’s face

LEWIS
So what are the most important
aspects of being a male model

MODEL 1
I would say look good

Lewis keeps looking at the guy expecting more The model
gets a bit flustered

LEWIS
Yes And

MODEL 1
Er that’s it

MODEL 2
And walk

LEWIS
Look good and walk But not at the
same time right

MODEL 1
Most of the times at the same time
LEWIS
Really Can you do that
MODEL 1
Sure
LEWIS

Please show us Yes yes go ahead

The model walks out of the line Before even reaching the end
of the room Lewis interrupts

LEWIS (CONTD)
Thank you Next
He picks his way through the crowd of shirtless men

LEWIS
What do we have here Hey there

MODEL 3
What’s up man

LEWIS
So I want to know did you parents
support you in being a male model

MODEL 3
All the way right from the start

LEWIS
Even your father

The model shrugs his shoulders and nods

MODEL 3
Even my father yeah Why

LEWIS
He wanted you to enter this
industry where you earn only 13 of
the women where you constantly
have to maneuver homosexual men who
want to sleep with you

Laughter all around the room

INT CASTING AGENCY CASTING ROOM - DAY

A MODEL stands solemnly in a bare room as the laughter from
the other room filters through the open door A SMALL DOG
stands nearby

Four panelists are sitting on the other side of a table On
the wall behind them is a big handwritten sign with
instructions on how to walk “Guys - Dead straight no arms
or hips Long neck very tall Think Couture Strong face and
eye No smile Own the room”

INT CASTING AGENCY WAITING ROOM - DAY
Lewis points towards the exit and moves on Suddenly he
catches sight of someone standing further down the line and

hurries of in his direction with the cameraman following

Its CARL waiting for his turn In his hand hes holding his
portfolio and a book
LEWIS
I’m Lewis Taylor and I’m standing
here with my very best friend

Lewis acts like he’s uncomfortable and fakes a whisper

LEWIS (CONT’D)
What was your name

CARL
Carl

LEWIS
My best friend Carl How are you
today Carl

CARL
Yeah good

LEWIS
So is this runway casting for a
grumpy brand or a smiley brand

CARL
Er I don’t know man I don’t
know

LEWIS

Well smiley brands are the cheap
ones and the more expensive the
brand gets you start to look down
on your consumer Like if you want
to be apart of this “von oben” one-
man in crows you have to show us
some serious cash

Lewis starts out with a smile but as he turns an imaginary
dial in the air his smile tones down and gradually
disappears becoming a bored grumpy face

CARL
Then it’s a “grumpy brand”

LEWIS
Congratulations I’m so happy for
you And if you get the job you
will get to wear exclusive
clothing and look down on your
consumer Okay Carl Show us some
of that grump look

CARL
No no
LEWIS
Yeah let’s go C’mon Carl You can
do it

Carl scowls at the camera and walks over the room and back
as Lewis ad libs a “voice-over”

LEWIS (CONT’D)

“Don’t you dare talk to me Im an
Aryan Ubermensch’too obsessed
with the image of myself to be
involved with anything that doesn’t
fit my stylized image of the world
Wait suddenly I’m dressed in
something less expensive It’s HandM

Carl has dialed up to a grin Lewis ushers the other models
of all ethnicities closer to Carl

LEWIS (CONT’D)
Everybody come together “You can
too be a part of this happy
smiling group of mixed skin colors
for not that much money
friendship everyonesequal
happylife stopclimatechange ”
Oh no Oh I am so sorry darling
I didn’t see that it was
Balenzzzziaga

Carl and the other models go back to a disdainful scowl

LEWIS (CONT’D)
“We are strong and tough and
unapproachable” Show me that
Balenciaga look Oh I’m sorry I
think it’s back to HandM again

The models laugh grin shift around Lewis launches into a
rapid-fire test

LEWIS (CONTD)

“Yeah we’re just kidding we’re so
cheap we’re so happy” Everybody
come closer together

(beat)
Balenciaga is back Ooh fiercer
than ever “We are stone cold Yes
Oh my god get away from us”

(beat)
HandM is here again Balenciaga HandM
Balenciaga And HandM Oh everybody
give it up for these guys
Fabulous Fabulous Carl
The models clap

INT CASTING AGENCY CASTING ROOM - DAY

Carl is ushered into the room by THE ASSISTANT He hands over
his portfolio The Designer flips through it without much
enthusiasm until he reaches a fragrance ad that features a
close-up of Carl’s face that takes up more than half the
page He looks up at Carl as if they can’t believe it’s the
same person

THE DESIGNER
Oh it’s you

CARL
Yeah

THE DESIGNER
You can hardly tell it’s the same
guy How old is this perfume
campaign

CARL
Three years ago and then maybe a
year after that

THE DESIGNER
You do castings again then

CARL
Yeah

THE CASTING DIRECTOR
Could you do a little walk for us
Quick no smiling no stopping

CARL
Yeah

Carl walks back across the room turns and comes back to the
panelists

THE CASTING DIRECTOR
One more time

He walks again

The Casting Director gives The Designer a look He stands and
comes around the table to Carl’s side
THE CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Okay today fashion is not just
about surface It’s about the
inside Think about a tune that you
like when you walk Look at me

CASTING DIRECTOR hums Staying Alive by The Bee Gees while
walking the room

THE CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Can you do that

CARL
Yeah so like a rhythm

THE CASTING DIRECTOR
Yeah Go

Carl walks again

THE DESIGNER
Can you relax your Triangle of
Sadness This like between your
eyebrows here

The Designer knits his brows and points at the worry lines
that appear between the eyes Carl automatically touches his
own triangle of sadness and smiles somewhat sheepishly

THE CASTING DIRECTOR
A little bit more Okay And open
your mouth so you look a little bit
more available

Carl opens wide

THE CASTING DIRECTOR (CONTD)
Okay not that much A little bit
less

He closes his mouth halfway

THE CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Okay Thank you very much

CARL
Thanks

CASTING ASSISTANT
Next please

Carl leaves and the next Model takes his place
PART 1 - CARL and YAYA

INT CATWALK RUNWAY SHOW - DAY

The atmosphere is tense and a bit stiff not only because
this is the opening at fashion shows the audience is just
as much on display as the models Everything that is worn -
clothing shoes accessories - every detail down to hair and
make-up has been carefully considered and chosen to reflect
where they believe they are in the pecking order

A HEADSET GIRL bows in front of a COUPLE sitting front row at
a packed fashion show and says something to them that
immediately upsets them

The Couple argues briefly before the Man gives in and waves
at his Wife to get up The Headset Girl grabs a third person
and moves them away as more headset girls come into view
walking backwards They are followed by Camilla Lackberg
dressed in sunglasses accompanied by an entourage of three

When it’s time for them to be seated they need one more
chair In a rather pushy way Headset Girls get everyone on
the entire row to get up and move one seat to the left We
follow the domino effect that leads to

Carl left without a seat at the end

CARL
Where can I sit

HEADSET GIRL
Sorry

CARL
I don’t have a seat now

HEADSET GIRL
There’s a seat I think just right
up there Just there

She waves to the back of the room Carl heads to the back and
climbs through the crowd

INT CATWALK RUNWAY SHOW - DAY
It’s dark except for flashing red lights and a screen behind

the runway which scrolls with messages like EVERYONE’S EQUAL
and LOVE NOW

The music is booming as YAYA steps out as the first model on
the catwalk dressed in two-meter-wide wings Hundreds of
phones and cameras are immediately pointed her way

At the back of the room behind all the rows of seats Carl
is watching

INT RESTAURANT - EVENING

Later that night Carl finds himself at an intimate
restaurant with his girlfriend Yaya They have enjoyed a
long meal together and the night is now winding down Only
one sensitive moment is still up for this relatively new
couple - the bill has to be cleared On a first second
third or even a fourth date Carl would not feel that he
would have any other option then to pay up This night
though if Carl doesn’t want to be stuck playing the
stereotypical “man” he has to take the bull by the horns
When the waiter puts the bill on the table between them Carl
realizes that Yaya is perfectly fine with the defined roles
and that she’s willing to fight She doesn’t even look at the
bill Instead she takes up her make-up mirror and starts to
do her lips Carl feels terrified but steels himself feigns
a few stretches even yawns Yaya lowers the make-up mirror
flashes him a smile and hides again

The time aspect of un-picked-up checks is far worse on a man
A man really despises himself whenever he feels like he’s
being ungenerous stingy Having this button pushed makes it
ten times worse Yaya is very aware of this all women are
Carl rests his arm on the tabletop moves his hand closer to
the bill waits a few seconds then carefully lifts just to
check

YAYA
Thank you honey That’s so sweet
of you

“How unbelievably rude” “You have to stand up for yourself
now Carl” - That’s what’s running through Carl’s head as he
sees his male pride picking up the check and opening his
wallet The contrast between his convictions and his actions
makes his face look like he just bit into a lemon

YAYA (CONT’D)
What’s the matter

CARL
No nothing

YAYA
I don’t know you looked like you
were thinking
CARL
No I’m not I’m not I’m cool

Carl shakes his head and smiles

YAYA
I can tell there’s something wrong
Just talk to me what is it

Yaya looks like a question mark
After a brief reflection he decides he won’t hold back

CARL
No it’s just When you say “Thank
you honey” like that you don’t
really give me an option but to
pay-

Brief silence

CARL (CONTD)
Just an observation Just something
I’ve noticed

YAYA
We can split the bill if you’d
like I can whip out a calculator
and

She demonstrates poring meticulously over each item with
finger

CARL
Of course I don’t want that

YAYA
I think it all evens out you know

CARL
Yeah okay Mmm

His “Mmm” is tinged with skepticism

CARL (CONTD)
Don’t you remember last night You
said you were gonna pay for food
today At the end of the meal you
said “Thanks Tomorrow I’1l1 get
it”

Yaya processes this information carefully Did she

YAYA
Sure but then you picked up the
bill and I thought you wanted to
pay so I said “Thank you honey”

Yaya glares at him and Carl becomes speechless This is
exactly the road he did not want to go down

CARL
But it was there for such a long
time

YAYA

I didn’t see it

CARL
You didn’t see it

YAYA
Or I just didn’t notice it We were
having a nice dinner

CARL
You didn’t see the bill when it got
put on the table

YAYA
No I didn’t Carl

CARL
So that waiter came in and put it
in the middle of the table and you
didn’t happen to see it

For a few seconds it’s a toss-up but then Carl makes the
horrible mistake of smiling in a self-righteous way

YAYA
Wow

CARL
What do you mean “Wow”

Yaya starts picking up her belongings she’s leaving

CARL (CONT’D)
What are you doing Sit down
Please Yaya sit down

We cut to see the entire restaurant Surrounded by tables and
guests Yaya is standing up and Carl is trying to convince
her to sit back down We cut back to their table

YAYA
I don’t knowI’m trying to figure
out what’s going on Apparently

I did something terrible when I
said “thank-you honey”

CARL
Calm down Please just sit down

YAYA
Why are you so obsessed with money

CARL
I’m not obsessed Can you just sit
down please It was just an
observation from yesterday Can you
please sit down

She leans in takes the check away from him sits down and
reaches for her handbag

CARL (CONTD)
No no What are you doing You
can’t pay now

She slips her credit card into the holder and holds it up in
the direction of the waiter that has been standing
uncomfortably close throughout

WAITER
Are we enjoying ourselves

CARL
Yes thanks

She extends the bill towards the waiter at the same time that
Carl tries to stop it from reaching him

CARL (CONTD)
Yaya

As the bill ends up in his hands the waiter looks confused
But when Yaya nods at him he walks off with her card Carl
immediately feels terribly ashamed It doesn’t matter if Yaya
was manipulating him or not all he wants is to put
everything right again

CARL (CONT’D)
Now I feel bad

YAYA
Why I make more money than you

The line is delivered with a strong negative valuation
They sit there in silence for a few seconds until their
waiter returns

WAITER
Excuse me Your card didn’t work
Do you have another one maybe

YAYA
Can you try it again

WAITER
I tried it twice

She pulls out an American Express card but the waiter shakes
his head They don’t accept American Express

Yaya slips it back in her wallet picks up the check looks
at the sum and pulls out a 50-euro note She places it on the
table and takes another look in her wallet but she doesn’t
seem to have any more cash This is Carl’s chance He hands
his card to the waiter

CARL
Just take this one

YAYA

Carl Just give me a second
CARL

Let me pay
WAITER

Yes thank you

Yaya leans back and pouts The waiter puts Carl’s card in the
reader hands it back to Carl that types in the tip and his
code The 50-euro bill is still on the table And the longer
it remains there the more Carl starts counting on it as a
contribution from Yaya 50 euros only covers one third of the
cost but under the circumstances Carl’s willing to accept
it as his chance to break even But when Carl is handed the
receipt and is just about to go for the bill Yaya picks it
up and pops it back in her wallet

INTEXT UBER CAR - NIGHT

The rain is pouring down and Yaya and Carl are quite wet when
they enter the Uber Despite all Carl is glad to have made
it through all that alive and he’s repressed the irritation
about the 50-euro bill

Now hes thinking that it might be good to try a different
approach - what if they could admit what each of them brought
to the table They might even be able to laugh it off

CARL
I do think it’s quite crazy how
it’s such a hard thing to talk
about Money

No answer

CARL (CONTD)
It’s such a touchy subject don’t
you think

No answer

YAYA
Yeah I think it’s un-sexy to talk
about money

Carls intention was to make peace now he feels completely
backstabbed He fights to keep calm

CARL
Okay but then why is that

No answer

YAYA
It’s just not sexy

CARL
Well you don’t think it’s because
it’s so tied to gender roles The
menu in the restaurant didn’t even
have prices for you

YAYA
That’s not fair Carl I’m always
paying

CARL

Let’s take you out of it and just
talk about women in general

YAYA

I’m a generous person Carl
CARL

Sure you’re a generous person

but

Yaya just stares at him

CARL (CONTD)
When it comes to you and me we’re
dealing with roles that I hate I
don’t want to be the man while you
the woman I want us to be best

friends

YAYA
I don’t want to sleep with my best
friend

CARL

But don’t you understand I mean
we should treat each other as
equals not just fall into the trap
of stereotypical gender-based
roles like most couples seem to
do

Yaya gets out of the car

INT HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The hotel elevator stops at their floor and the doors swing
open Both of them are soaking wet Carl is in mid-rant

CARL
You know I don’t mind paying I
really like to invite you I really
enjoy it but there’s a
limit a point where I feel used I
hate that I feel that way but
I do I’m sorry

YAYA
I use you

CARL
I’m just referring to my feelings
now but okay we could go through
the last few days and

YAYA
Are you serious now You are
staying at my hotel I I I bought
you that t-shirt and I invited you
for dinner tonight

CARL
You got this t-shirt for free
and actually you didn’t invite me
for dinner

YAYA
That’s because my card didnt work

Carl is smiling ironically Yaya can’t believe her eyes

YAYA (CONT’D)
There’s a cash machine in the
lobby I’1ll pay back every last
cent right this minute

She presses the button to the lobby

CARL
You know what It’s ok

Carl presses the button that holds the doors open

YAYA
Im going to pay you back Carl
I just didnt realize that you
needed the money right now when we
are going to bed

She pushes the close button Carl pushes the open button
Yayas last sentence really triggers him He looks at her
pauses for effect and delivers the following with as much
gravitas as he can muster

CARL
Ah so your intention was to pay
me back
YAYA
Yes of course
CARL
Really
YAYA
Yes
CARL

Then why did you take the 50-euro
bill from the table

The elevator doors start closing and Carl movies to block
them

CARL (CONTD)
When your card didnt work you
started to look for cash in your
wallet and you put down a 50-
euro bill on the table right
And when you didnt have enough
(MORE )

CARL (CONTD)
cash I paid with my card And
then instead of giving the 50
euros to me you picked it up
from the table and put it back in
your purse

Yaya shakes her head slowly The look in her eyes is deadly

CARL (CONT’D)
What I’m just relaying what
actually happened

Yaya locates her wallet in her handbag picks out the 50-euro
bill and crams it into Carl’s shirt pocket

CARL (CONT’D)
What the hell are you doing

Carl looks shocked steps back leaving the elevator doorway

CARL (CONT’D)
DON’T YOU DO THAT TO ME DON’T
YOU FUCKING DO THAT TO ME YOU
DONT FUCKING DO THAT TO ME

He grabs the 50 euros folds the bill and pushes it through
the slot between the elevator and the building so it falls
down into the elevator shaft

YAYA
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MY MONEY

CARL
HAHAHA YOUR MONEY

The doors start to close

YAYA
THAT’S RIGHT MY MONEY

CARL
OH MY GOD YOUR MONEY YOUR 50
EUROS I’LL GIVE YOU 100 EUROS
1000 FUCKING EUROS IF YOU LIKE
WHY CAN’T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
THIS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY

The door is shut

CARL (CONT’D)
THIS IS NOT ABOUT

Carl presses the button but it won’t open He remains

standing there for a while the wind taken out of his sails

CARL (CONT’D)
money

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 8

As he turns to head for their hotel room he faces a cleaning
lady staring right at him Carl’s too upset to be ashamed
and strides past her in the hallway At first with
determination - after all it’s crystal clear that she was in
the wrong Then comes the split-second of doubt He tries to
shoo it away with the memory of Yaya stuffing that bill in
his shirt pocket so totally unacceptable He did the right
thing The hallway is long and doubt comes boomeranging
back The closer he gets to their room the more it all hits
home

INT HOTEL CARL and YAYA’S ROOM - NIGHT 9

Finally inside the room he tries to text and call Yaya with
no answer He takes off his clothes and gets in bed presses
all six light buttons but can’t figure out how to turn the
lights off

Gets up to unscrew the bulb itself when the door opens and
closes

Yaya pokes her head in she looks unhappy They sit across
from each other

CARL
What have you been doing

YAYA
Trying to sleep on a chair

CARL
Howd that go

YAYA
Well I’m back What have you been
doing

CARL

I was walking up and down the
corridor and texting you multiple
times

YAYA
This is so silly
YAYA (CONTD)
I’m so good at being manipulative
I don’t know I do it and I don’t
even realize that I’m doing it

CARL
I love you No but seriously it’s
amazing that you can tell me that
Now you’re a generous person

YAYA
Okay Ask me anything

CARL
You sure

CARL (CONTD)
In the restaurant with the bill

YAYA
What about it

CARL
You intentionally didn’t pick that
up right

YAYA
Yes

CARL
Didn’t that embarrass you

YAYA
No

CARL
But you make more money than I do

YAYA
It doesn’t really matter who makes
more money

CARL
What is it about then

YAYA

What if I fall pregnant
CARL

With me
YAYA

What if I fall pregnant and I can’t
go on working
(MORE )

YAYA (CONTD)

I need to know that the person I’m
with intends to take care of me
Otherwise I’m wasting my time

CARL
Yeah I guess you’re not the kind
to work in a restaurant or a
supermarket are you No offense

YAYA
I’m a model the only way for me to
get out of this life is to become
someone’s trophy wife

CARL
So there’s nothing else to this
for you other than increasing the
followers on our Instagram and all

that
YAYA

It makes sense doesn’t it
CARL

Sure
YAYA

I like you You like me It’s good
for business

CARL
Nothing more

Yaya shakes her head

CARL (CONTD)
Id like to put a bet on that

YAYA
Okay Deal

CARL
Well see I’1l make you love me
Itll be real love as well You’1ll
forget about this trophy shit and
youll love me

Carl smiles lovingly at her Yaya purses her lips to keep
from smiling back She looks lovingly at Carl at his hair
his sad blue eyes

PART TWO - THE CRUISE SHIP

INTEXT HELICOPTER - DAY

The interior of a helicopter We focus on a parcel that the
copilot has on his lap Through the window behind the
parcel we see a turquoise sea flashing past When the
helicopter slows down and begins to hover the copilot opens
the side door hooks up the parcel to a wire pulley and
lowers it

EXT SPEEDBOAT - DAY 18

On the rear deck of a luxurious sailing yacht we see a
Filipino crew member wearing sports goggles with reflective
lenses gazing up at the chopper generating massive winds
After a while he reaches skywards and grabs the parcel
unhooks it says something into his walkie-talkie and the
wire that lowered the parcel is hauled back up

EXT YACHT DECK - DAY 19

We cut to a long shot and see the wire going back up to the
helicopter hovering some 50 meters over the cruise ship When
only a few meters are left to go the pilot dips the nose of
the chopper and leaves

INT YACHT HALLWAYS and KITCHEN - DAY 20
The parcel is carried down the hallways and into the
galley
INT YACHT KITCHEN - DAY 21
-where it is handed over to one of the chefs He places it
on a counter and starts opening it revealing three jars

of Nutella We hear a VO while the Nutella jars are on
screen

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA (0S)
The success of a luxury cruise
depends mainly on two moments
Number one The first hours the
guests are on board Number two
The last day the guests are on
board

INT YACHT LOBBY - DAY 22

We cut to the lobby and see that the voice belongs to the
Chief Stewardess who’s gathered the service staff for a pep-
talk Everyone in the room is sporting the ship’s uniform a
white polo shirt blue slacks blue sailing shoes They all
have a deep tan from spending a season at sea The Chief
Stewardess is pretty and girlish yet still as steely as a
drill instructor

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
If we can impress them on those two
occasions then the cruise will
probably be a success I don’t want
to hear anybody saying “we don’t
need to cover the sundeck they all
leave after breakfast” No I want
full set-up every morning No
excuses Not even for the last
hour It’s always “Yes sir Yes
ma’am” If there is an illegal
substance they want or a unicorn

She opens her arms wide like a conductor

CREW
“Yes sir Yes ma’am”

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Yes I know I know what it is to
work for service I know all the
challenges you’re facing but at
these times I ask of you to keep
that chin up Stay strong and try
to remind yourself that if
everything goes well at the end of
the cruise

The people at one of the tables start doing a drum roll with
their hands on the table

CREW
Money money money

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
A very generous tip

CREW
Money Money Money Money

The staff cheers

INT YACHT FILIPINO CREW CABIN - DAY 23

On the lowest deck under the waterline you find the
Filipino crew members Dressed in uniform - a blue tee blue
slacks blue sailing shoes and shades with reflective lenses
- they are playing cards in a cabin with bunk beds When they
hear the noise from the service staff one deck higher up
they momentarily gaze at the ceiling The reflective goggles
make the men look mean and insect-like Why did the director
choose these attributes we wonder

INT YACHT CARL AND YAYA’S CABIN - MORNING

Carl and Yaya are passed out in the bed tangled up in the
sheets when ABIGAIL THE TOILET MANAGER knocks on the door

ABIGAIL (0S)
Housekeeping

No one answers She knocks again listens opens the door and
walks into the little hallway but stops immediately when she
hears someone calling

CARL
No No thank you
ABIGAIL
Do you want me to clean the room
CARL
No thanks
ABIGAIL

Okay Ill come back in 30 minutes

CARL
No you can come back a bit later

ABIGAIL
Okay one hour

YAYA
Could you just come back a bit
later please

ABIGAIL
Okay Ill come back later Sorry
ma’am

Abigail leaves

EXT YACHT A DECK FORWARD - DAY

Yaya is posing in a bikini on the rear deck Carl is taking
the photos After a couple of shots Yaya shows that she wants
to have a look Carl hands over the mobile phone to her and
Yaya scrolls back and forth commenting on the pictures

Carl looks at the sea and then at a crew member who jumps

down to the deck slips off his t-shirt Carl reacts - the
crew don’t usually draw any attention to themselves Going
bare- chested is very inappropriate and probably not allowed
on board In addition to this the man’s body is not a pumped-
up gym product like his own but naturally tanned and
perfectly chiseled by repeated hard labor

Then he realizes that Yaya is right next to him that she can
see what he sees too and he becomes afraid of where her gaze
may have wandered

The crew member starts smiling and Yaya smiled back Carl is
convinced about what’s going on It’s utterly shameless to
flirt with someone in front of their partner If Yaya is
allowing him to do this it will exponentially increase the
humiliation factor Carl gives Yaya an accusing look

YAYA

What
CARL

Nothing
CREW MEMBER

Hey
YAYA

Hey

She’s talking to him Carl becomes furious

CARL

What are you doing Are you talking
to the crew

YAYA
Yeah

CARL
Why are you talking to the crew

YAYA
I said hello
CARL
Yeah you smiled at him and you
said hello

YAYA
So

CARL
Seriously Yaya we’re sitting here
together you don’t just do that

YAYA
Do what

CARL
If I started smiling at the hot
stewardess and you know

YAYA
You think she’s hot

CARL
No but if she was and I started
smiling at her and giggling and
saying “Hey” like you did then
you wouldn’t like it would you

YAYA
Are you jealous

CARL
No No I’m not It’s just like I
mean look at you Then a hot guy
turns up

YAYA
Do you think he’s hot

CARL
He’s alright Do you

YAYA
Yeah

CARL
What the fuck

YAYA
You just said you thought he was
hot

CARL
But you don’t have to You said
it very quickly Jesus

YAYA
Drop it okay

She goes back to her phone Carl remains distracted by the
shirtless crew member

INT YACHT RECEPTION DESK - DAY

20 seconds later Carl rings the bell at the reception desk
While he’s waiting his eyes wander to the items in the glass
case Carl is interrupted by the arrival of the Chief
Stewardess that comes from the deck above

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Can I help you sir

CARL
Sorry just quickly I was on the
rear deck and one of your crew
members was bare-chested

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Really

CARL
Yeah and smoking

She frowns to show how serious this was

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Oh I’m so sorry That’s so
inappropriate I’ll take care of
that I’m so sorry

CARL
Maybe it’s not a big issue

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
No but it’s not acceptable here

CARL
I thought I’d let you know I
didn’t want to make anything of it

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Thank you so much It won’t happen
again sir I promise you that

CARL
Alright thanks

Carl leaves the reception and The Chief Stewardess turns to
ALICIA THE STEWARDESS

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Alicia There’s a crew member up on
the deck with no shirt on

ALICIA
No shirt on

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Yes

Suddenly Carl appears in front of the reception desk again
The Chief Stewardess shoots a quizzical glance at him from
the doorway Their previous encounter is still fresh in the
memory

CARL
Sorry

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Yes

Carl summons up courage

CARL
Is it possible to look at
engagement rings

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Yes of course

She flashes him a friendly smile gets up and places the tray
with the rings on the counter

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA (CONT’D)
This is a beautiful ring This is
24-carat gold We have a point nine
diamond in the middle and we have
four brilliants on every side Of
the band It’s a very beautiful
ring

CARL
Yes It’s really nice

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

can see it on a hand

CARL
Oh okay yeah

Paula places the ring on her finger to show off to Carl

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
It’s a very nice diamond a
flawless diamond

CARL
What was the price of that one

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
This one is 28000 euros

Carl nods

INT YACHT OUTSIDE CAPTAIN’S CABIN - DAY

The Chief Stewardess is now hurrying along the fourth deck
At the end of the corridor the Chief Stewardess stops knocks
on a cabin door and listens

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Captain

Not a sound She knocks again

CAPTAIN (0S)
(through the door)
Yes

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
I just wanted to tell you that it’s
time for the safety drill

CAPTAIN (0S)

A troubled look momentarily passes over the Chief
Stewardess’s face

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Should I get the doctor

CAPTAIN (0S)
No I’1l be fine Just have the
First take care of it and then I’1l
see you later

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Okay

INT YACHT DINING ROOM - DAY

We enter the dining room where it’s lunchtime A waiter walks
up and places a Nutella jar at the table of DIMITRY a
Russian billionaire

The patriarch sits with two women -- VERA older and
LUDMILLA younger It’s not easy to understand what kind of
relationship they have to each other Are they sisters Are
they wife and mistress

At the other side of the same table sit Carl and Yaya Carl
is taking photos of Yaya raising a fork of pasta towards her
mouth But she never lets the pasta reach her lips and when
shes satisfied with the picture she pushes the plate away
from her Dimitry stares at her and makes a confused face

DIMITRY
Aren’t you going to eat the pasta

Yaya looks up at Dimitry from her screen

YAYA
Sorry

DIMITRY
Aren’t you going to eat the pasta

YAYA
Oh No I’m gluten intolerant

Carl tries to cover the awkward silence

CARL
It’s just for pictures She’s an
influencer

ZLATKO
Okay You make money from that

CARL
It depends You mostly get free
stuff to be honest We got this
cruise for free

DIMITRY
Good Her looks paid for the
tickets Not bad huh

CARL
I guess so yeah It did So what
do you do

DIMITRY

CARL
What sorry

DIMITRY

agriculture

CARL
Oh fertilizer Interesting

DIMITRY
In every business it’s the right
place in the right moment My right
place east Europe Right moment
end of the 80s beginning of the
90s

LUDMILLA
Baby Can I have this one

The younger of the two women shows something on her phone to
Dimitry

DIMITRY
Yeah

LUDMTILLA
Thank you Love you

Dimitry gets back to telling his story

ZLATKO
So in the beginning of the 80s I
was only CEO in one agriculture
“Kombinat” we called it A hundred
thousand pigs two million
chickens and we’re getting some
kind of monopoly You can call me
the King of the Shit When you have
money you know you don’t leave
money to sleep you understand
Money must not sleep So you put
this money from this business
because factories are shutting
down

We leave the table as we catch up on a waiter that is
carrying a bottle of champagne We stop at the table of a old
cute British couple WINSTON and CLEMENTINE On the other
side THERESE who is impaired by a stroke and sitting ina
wheelchair

WINSTON
You have the panna cotta I’1l have
the tiramisu

CLEMENTINE
Fine

Clementine leans over and smiles towards Therese

CLEMENTINE (CONT’D)
I’m Clementine and this is my
husband Winston We’re from Great
Britain

Therese smiles at Clementine but instead of answering she
starts to look around

CLEMENTINE (CONT’D)

My name is Clementine And this is
my husband Winston We’re from
Great Britain

After a couple of seconds Therese’s husband Uli arrives to
the table

ULI
Hello This is my wife Therese
She understands you perfectly but
my wife had a stroke Since then
she’s suffering from a disability
of speaking

THERESE
In den Wolken

CLEMENTINE
In den Wolken What does it mean

ULI
Up in the clouds

CLEMENTINE
Oh How beautiful
EXT YACHT A DECK FORWARD - DAY
The shirtless crew member is ushered off the yacht onto a
waiting speed boat He says his goodbyes to fellow crew

members

Carl watches from above

EXT YACHT BAR DECK - NIGHT
Music plays and lights spin on the deck as people mingle

Dimitry is having a drink at a table next to Carl A couple
of meters away from them is Finnish businessman in his 50s
JARMO sitting alone

Jarmo is holding on to a tall glass of beer for dear life
while he stares at Yaya and Ludmilla Is it curiosity that
captivates him or desire We have no idea but his gazing is
doomed with prejudice Suddenly Dimitry leans towards Carl

DIMITRY
Look at that Sad huh He’s
hunting Big dilemma Should he
take the risk or go to his room
Look look Maybe he has a chance

With his eyes on the horizon Jarmo sighs deeply before
turning his gaze back on to the young females

JARMO
Sorry if I’m interrupting Could
you do me a favor I have this girl
who should be here with me but
couldn’t come and I would like to
take a picture please Can you take
my picture

YAYA
Of course

Jarmo gives Yaya his phone and places himself in the bar with
one of the beers slightly raised towards the lens Yaya takes
some pictures and hand back the phone

JARMO
Thank you very much

YAYA
A pleasure

JARMO
Have a nice evening

YAYA
You too

They smile at each other and Jarmo returns to his beers It’s
a sad image Touching A lonely man in a bar scrolling
through images of himself - alone in a bar Suddenly Yaya is
struck by empathy

YAYA (CONT’D)
Excuse me Mister Could you please
come back You can leave your beer
If you come in the middle Then we
can take a picture together

Yaya extends her hand towards Jarmo’s phone Jarmo takes a
step closer and gives it to her Then the girls places Jarmo
in between them puts their arms around his neck and start
posing away 20 duckface - boob pushing - cheek kissing -
later Jarmo returns to his spot in the bar with a big smile
on his face

JARMO
Okay nice Yeah Now we’re
talking Thank you very much
You’re very generous

He’s pointing towards Yaya

Suddenly the smiles on Carl and Dimitry’s faces have
vanished Instead they look angry

JARMO (CONTD)
I would like to do something
generous for you They have Rolex
watches in the reception We can go
down there now and I will buy you
Rolex watches

YAYA
No its okay thank you

JARMO
It may sound strange but I’m
What you just did there it meant
so much to me So I can I’m very
rich Yes let’s not beat around the
bush I’m very rich

YAYA
How rich are you

JARMO
I’m so fucking rich I just sold my
company

INT YACHT OUTSIDE CAPTAIN’S CABIN - NIGHT
The Chief Stewardess comes walking along the corridor on the

fourth deck again She stops outside the Captain’s cabin

YAYA

JARMO

Guys you take care of these girls

Generous Caring You treat them

Dimitry leaves calling for Ludmilla to come with him

EXT YACHT C DECK TOP DECK - NIGHT

A sleepy version of Des’ree’s “Life (Oh life)” played by the
lounge pianist is heard in the background while a guard is
patrolling the deck with his machine gun

EXT YACHT BAR DECK - NIGHT

Yaya dances by Jarmo’s chair Trying to tug him onto the
dance floor He resists

JARMO
I’m terrible at dancing

YAYA
What if I go Come on dance with
me Just a little bit Don’t be
shy

She realizes he’s not going to get up Gives up and goes back
to her seat

INT YACHT CARL AND YAYA’S CABIN - NIGHT

By the time Yaya reaches the cabin the lights are out and
Carl’s in bed with his back to the door Yaya knows that Carl
will be in a bad mood and tries to make her voice soft and
tender

YAYA
Carl

She immediately realizes that her voice was too cautious
This will only annoy the receiver She clears her throat and
tries to sound more rational

YAYA (CONTD)
Carl Are you jealous

Still no answer Yaya goes over and sits down on the bed She
reaches out to touch Carl but he’s not there The blanket
has been stuffed with pillows

CARL
Who’s Carl

The voice is coming from behind the bathroom door The light
turns on and he steps out

YAYA
What You’re not Carl

CARL
No I’m the pool guy Sorry about
coming into the mansion I just
needed to get some tools Over
here

Yaya laughs relieved that Carl is choosing an unexpected
strategy to handle his lost masculinity

Yaya smiles and plays along pointing him to the imaginary
tools Trying not to laugh

YAYA
It’s very inappropriate What if my
husband comes home

CARL
Where is your husband He really
shouldn’t be leaving such a
beautiful girl on her own because
it’s very dangerous around here

YAYA
You should take that off
He strips off his shirt for her

CARL
You see the thing is your husband
pays me a lot of money So I do
have to make sure I’m doing my job
properly Okay

YAYA
You check the pipes

They try not to laugh

They kiss

YAYA (CONT’D)
Youre sure you’re the right guy
for the job

CARL
I am I’m very qualified

EXT YACHT A DECK FORWARD - DAY

Awkwardly Yaya
idea of how to
shows that she

“uses” boat props without having the slightest
handle them After a couple of shots Yaya
wants to have a look Carl hands over the
mobile phone to her and Yaya scrolls back and forth

commenting on the pictures Carl’s opinion seems to not be of

interest “Boyfriends
feels like right now
to just take pictures
girlfriends He’s not

Elsewhere on the deck Vera the older of Dimitry’s two

of Instagram” That’s exactly what Carl
Like these boyfriends that are reduced
of their narcissistic Instagram

even a male model anymore

women sits in the jacuzzi while Alicia the Stewardess sits
at the edge and waits on her

VERA
Do you know what people regret on
their deathbed

ALICIA

VERA
That they were working too much
seven out of ten people regret
throwing away their lives on stupid
and pointless jobs

Alicia smiles gently

ALICIA
Can I get you anything to drink

Vera extends her glass towards the stewardess who takes the
champagne bottle from the ice bucket and fills it up

VERA
More champagne please I don’t
know I was just born into this
life It was not my fault and when
this happened I just felt like
“why” Life is so unfair

ALICIA
Yeah

VERA
We are all equal

ALICIA
That is so true

VERA
Everyone’s equal Is there anything
you wish for

Vera gets excited she really feels that there is a
connection between them

ALICIA
Sorry

VERA
Is there anything you wish for

ALICIA
Well I don’t know

VERA
But if today was your last day
alive what would you wish for

ALICIA
I have no idea

VERA
Have you been for a swim today

ALICIA
No not today

VERA
Why don’t you go for a swim right
now Because this is exactly what
I’m talking about

ALICIA
That’s so kind of you madam but
unfortunately we’re not allowed to
go for a swim during working hours

VERA
I want all the staff to go for a
swim I want you all to go fora
swim

ALICIA
Well today might ab a little bit
problematic because today we have
the Captain’s Dinner

VERA
Who cares about the Captain’s
Dinner This will only take half an
hour You work too hard come on

ALICIA
Let me see what I can do

VERA
Merci

The stewardess moves backwards trying to escape but Vera
stops her

VERA (CONTD)
No no come back Come back please

Alicia kneels beside her again

ALICIA
Okay

VERA
Let’s reverse roles

ALICIA

jacuzzi and I’ll get the captain
Come on Just be in the moment

VERA
Yes Don’t worry Dimitry will buy

ALICIA
Okay I’m going in

In order to not lose all dignity the stewardess now starts
playing along She slips into the jacuzzi waist-high with an
uncomfortable smile Passing stewardesses give her strange
looks

VERA
Dimitry A glass of champagne for
this wonderful Miss

She waits She doesn’t even know her name

ALICIA
Alicia

INTEXT YACHT BRIDGE BRIDGE - DAY
The Chief Stewardess hurries up to the crew deck

Before the Chief Stewardess enters the bridge we have time
to notice a portrait of Marx and one of Lenin and that the
Captain’s chair at the helm is symbolically vacant

Instead the FIRST OFFICER smokes on the deck

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Darius I need your help I need
you to tell one of the guests that
the crew can’t go for a swim

Darius the First Officer doesn’t seem to be surprised

DARIUS
Why

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Well I told them it’s not possible
because of the dinner but they
want to hear it from the captain in
person So I went to Thomas’s
cabin I knocked on it he’s not
there He’s not responding I can’t
get a hold of him so could you just
please go and tell them it’s not
possible That would be a big help

DARIUS
Can’t you just go for a swim

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
No I mean that would be easiest
but they want us to go down the
water slide and It’s not funny

A nearby CREW MEMBER laughs to himself

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA (CONT’D)
Why are you laughing Erik Why are
you even here

ERIK
I’m on my break

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Well your break is over Go back
to work
(to Darius)
The chef has started the dinner I
need the prep-time So please go
and tell them it’s not possible

DARIUS
I’m not going to go and talk to
some crazy Russians

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
It’s not crazy Russians it’s very
rich Russians

DARIUS
Same thing We’re done Go and take
a swim

They notice that a GUEST is hanging near the bridge door

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Hello Sir Do you want to see the
bridge

GUEST
If possible

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Of course I can get the First
Officer He’s not doing anything
right now Can you show the guest
the bridge please

DARIUS
Yes of course Welcome to the
bridge

Paula hurries away

INT YACHT OUTSIDE CAPTAIN’S CABIN - DAY

We follow her feet as the Chief Stewardess pops down to the
fourth deck and the Captain’s cabin The camera tilts up to
show her face The Chief Stewardess knocks and waits but no
one opens the door

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Thomas Thomas Hello

Not a sound She knocks again Still nothing She knocks a
third time and jiggles the door handle An elderly couple
come down the hallway and the Chief Stewardess immediately
flashes them a smile

LADY 1
Good Afternoon

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Good afternoon

The LADY nods and is about to pass by but decides to stop

LADY 1
Actually I have a question

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Yes of course

LADY 1
Yesterday I was up on the sundeck
and the sun was shining everything
was perfect But then I looked at
the sails

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
The sails

LADY 1
Yes And they were a bit dirty

The Chief Stewardess nods and smiles It’s impressive to see
how she never loses her temper In the presence of
passengers there’s always a smile on her face and when they
are out of sight she looks neutral Never gets emotional no
matter what happens

However this is the tail end of the cruise season and three
months of spoiled guests at sea have gotten under the skin of
the staff anyone who has ever worked in the service sector
knows what this means you start to hate not only the
customers but mankind in general

We follow the Chief Stewardess as she disappears down the
hallway and for a second out of the movie set

INT YACHT KITCHEN - DAY 44

In the kitchen the Chef and four of his assistants are
preparing the Captain’s Dinner When the in-house phone
rings the Chef clamps the handset to his ear with his
shoulder to keep on working

CHEF
Hello Yeah but do you realize the
food down here is going to be bad
Okay bye

He hangs up the phone

CHEF (CONTD)
Okay guys listen up You are going
to swim So bring your swimming
pants and go to the main deck as
quick as possible okay You’re
going to the water slide Have fun

The kitchen staff hurry out

INT CREW QUARTERS -

A CREWMAN knocks on every door in the hall calling for them
to come out He scolds two SITTING MAIDS they get up

INT YACHT OUTSIDE CAPTAIN’S CABIN - DAY 46

The First Officer stops at the Captain’s cabin and is just
about to knock when the PA system signals

DING-—DONG

CHIEF STEWARDESS (0S)
I hope everyone’s had a great day
so far and that you’re looking
forward to the Captain’s Dinner
tonight

The door swings open THE CAPTAIN is standing there his hair
is wet and hes wearing a bathrobe He looks puzzled to see

the First Officer but they have to remain silent because the
message blares out of the PA system

CHIEF STEWARDESS (0S) (CONTD)
Id just like to inform you that
we have a slight change to the
schedule The Captain’s Dinner
will start at eight thirty and
not at eight as it says on the
daily program I repeat The
Captain’s Dinner will start at
eight thirty and not at eight
Thank you

THE CAPTAIN
Why the push

DARIUS
The crew’s going for a swim It’s a
request from one of the Russians
From the water slide

A smile spreads across the Captain’s face Any concerns that
he would be angry are now dismissed - he and the First
Officer appear to be good friends

THE CAPTAIN
Oh my god I’ve gotta see

DARIUS
I think you need to change if you
want to go up Let’s go inside and
talk We have four and a half hours
left until the Captain’s Dinner
You chill in your room have a
little nap I’1l be back ina
couple of hours and we’ll go
together

THE CAPTAIN
Darius Look at you What are you
all worked up about I’m fine

The Captain laughs even winks

EXT YACHT ENGINE ROOM - DAY

One engineer shouts to another over the roar of the engine to
come upstairs

EXT YACHT REAR DECK - DAY

So there they are the entire crew All lined up on the rear
deck in swim gear One by one they enter the waterslide
slide down into the water swim out in a semicircle and
return to the swimming platform attached to the yacht

Vera smiles and cheers the crew on

INT YACHT (VARIOUS ROOMS) - EVENING

The sky has gone dark blue and thunderclaps are increasing in
frequency The yacht is starting to rock and we see a collage
of inanimate objects curtains and a chandelier a door left
open a champagne glass rolling back and forth and getting
close to the edge of the table It’s slightly spooky

INT YACHT DINING ROOM - EVENING
Paula and Darius escort the Captain into position

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
If you stand here and they will be
coming to you Let me see you Just
one night that’s all

THE CAPTAIN
Okay

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Okay you’re ready

THE CAPTAIN
Yes

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Okay lets get ready to open the
doors Andgo

When the doors to the dining room open 30 minutes behind
schedule the crowd bobs in time with the waves making them
look like they’re drunk High heels and pencil skirts aren’t
exactly conducive to balance After marking their chosen
seats as taken they all line up to shake hands with the
Captain and First Officer Darius

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA (CONT’D)
Would you like a glass of
champagne

THE CAPTAIN
Good evening Enjoying your cruise
DARIUS
Welcome Enjoy your dinner Hope
the weather’s not too rough on you

Next it’s Lady 1’s turn in line

LADY 1
I have a question I’m sorry
Yesterday I was up on the deck And
it was so beautiful Everything was
fantastic But then I saw the
sails

THE CAPTAIN
The sails

LADY 1
The sails yes They were dirt-
gray Do you think it’s possible to
wash them

The lady smiles warmly and doesn’t appear to have a clue

her words

She calls

might be perceived as criticism

THE CAPTAIN
Well I don’t think that’s
possible ma’am because this is a
motorized vessel So we don’t have
any sails

DARIUS
Maybe it was the sundeck roof

LADY 1
Are you sure

THE CAPTAIN
I’m sure

to her husband and confers with him

LADY 1
Yes He says yes It was sails

THE CAPTAIN
Well in that case we will clean
the sails

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
I’m sure we can find a solution for
you Can I escort you to a table

Jarmo steps up next

at

JARMO
Jarmo Bjorkman I’m sitting at your
table

CAPTAIN

Oh Good good

DARIUS
Hello Jarmo

A wave hits the boat making a baby start to cry The Captain
takes a deep breath

INT YACHT DINING ROOM (AT TABLE 1) - EVENING

As the guests read the seven-course menu most of them regret
not just staying in their cabins Tonight’s gastronomical
theme is a fusion between Cantonese and Swedish delicacies
from the sea A biased summary of the Cantonese cuisine is
that you eat anything that doesn’t make you sick Sick not
seasick The Swedish seafood tradition is less familiar to
them so far

Jarmo babbles at the Captain

JARMO
It’s not so much apps as code I
create code for apps So I sell my
codes and my skills to different
tech companies And then the game
makers are pitching ideas to me

As each dish is served the service staff wait until everyone
is in place The plates are set down at the same time in
perfect choreography

Ta-da

Pointing with their pinkies they explain that the first dish
is oysters with black Russian caviar

Though it may be physically possible to leave the table it’s
hardly socially acceptable The dinner guests are prisoners
of etiquette Still there are some guests that are trying
to keep up a good spirit At the table of the cute British
couple Clementine and her husband Winston are seated with
Carl and Yaya

CARL
So what business do you have
together

WINSTON
Oh it’s a family business
Producing products in precision
engineering

CARL
What do you manufacture

WINSTON
Well our products have been
employed in upholding democracy all
over the world

Winston smiles and so does Carl only he doesn’t quite get
it

CARL
What product is that

WINSTON
Basically our best selling product
is the hand grenade

Yaya has now finished answering the text and puts her phone
away

YAYA
Sorry what

CLEMENTINE
The hand grenade dear

On the far side of the room a guest vomits on their way out
of the room The people at the table look away

WINSTON
For a long time it was the personal
exploding device But then came
those UN regulations and messed
everything up

Clementine realizes that the table guests might need some
help with the technical language

CLEMENTINE
“Personal exploding device” is a
very complicated word for a
landmine

WINSTON
Those regulations trimmed 25 off
our profit It resulted in hard
times for us we had to restructure
the whole company

CLEMENTINE
Yes

Clementine smiles sadly at the thought of these hard times
Winston takes her hand

WINSTON
But we made it together

CLEMENTINE
Yes we did and we still love each
other A toast

WINSTON
To love

A table guest who now looks a bit pale gets up and quickly
leaves the table without looking back The others regard him
with envy before going back to staring at their plates About
twenty seconds later a stream of vomit splatters the outside
of a window vent near their table The Chief Stewardess
excuses herself and goes to talk to one of the dining room
staff Twenty Two seconds later a squeegee appears and
scrapes off the mess on the window vent

INT YACHT DINING ROOM (AT TABLE 2) - EVENING

A subtle sense of anxiety now charges the air which is
evident in the subdued conversations Fear of seasickness
will slowly break down all the mental resistance to its
existence When the third dish is served

Ta-da

Dimitry’s wife Vera is confronted with a huge mound of red
caviar-like fish roe Each time the yacht surges on the
waves the roe jiggles

WAITER
Sir Madam This is “kalix lé6jrom”
a fish roe under a bed of
deconstructed seaweed Enjoy

VERA
Thank you

There is a word in Hungarian “gailt” that means the
sensation where your food seems to grow in your mouth and
everyone in the room will soon know that feeling Vera
gingerly tastes the roe At first she looks unaffected but
soon we realize that she is unable to bring herself to
swallow it

When an off-screen person vomits in the dining room her
faces changes color

GUEST 1 (0S)
Uahhh

Vera’s head begins to turn a few degrees towards the sound
but doesn’t get there

Instead her body surprises her by regurgitating some scallop
to mix with the roe in her mouth She manages to keep it from
escaping with a refill of the champagne

Vera nods and forces herself to swallow the mess The waiter
fills her glass and she rinses her palate with a gulp

Utensils shake and champagne sloshes more roughly as the
storm outside worsens

INT YACHT HALL - EVENING

A maid cart rolls down the hall at top speed and collides
with the wall

INT YACHT DINING ROOM - EVENING

One thing you need to know about seasickness is that it is
even worse on an empty stomach This is something the staff
and Paula feel obligated to share with the guests

PAULA
If you are feeling seasick try
to eat something Try to swallow
ma’am you will feel much better
soon

As usual the staff and in particular the Chief Stewardess
never stop smiling Not even when the waves get so high that
the china and silverware start sliding off the tables Not
even when attacks of vomiting will soon start spreading like
an epidemic

INT YACHT DINING ROOM (AT TABLE 3) - EVENING 56

The Captain’s plate is set down a burger and some fries For
the guests a severed octopus tentacle on a plate of flowers

WAITER
So now we are serving some
hamburger with french fries for the
captain

CAPTAIN
I’m not a fan of fine dining

A Waiter offers Vera a bottle

WAITER
Madam Dagueneau French Sauvignon
blanc

VERA

Champagne Quick

Vera tries to laugh it off but with tears in her eyes
Alternating smiles and gagging

Two guests excuse themselves and leave the Captain’s table
Following some gagging in unison a substantial number of the
guests start vomiting They throw up into their napkins on
their plates into their champagne glasses in the wine
buckets and under the table

Vera flings herself from her chair and projectile vomits
across the table

Ludmilla the younger of Dimitry’s women hurries to help
her She mumbles for champagne

Someone pours her a glass She chugs it down and immediately
vomits it out again The room now full of shrieking and
crying

Yaya fans herself with the menu Carl reaches over to touch
her

CARL
Are you okay

She nods
The Captain gestures across the room

CAPTAIN
He doesn’t look well

Crew hurry to a man clutching his chest

CREW MEMBER
Are you having chest pains

This marks the start of a collective retreat Nearly every
last one of the guests get up and leave Halfway through the
dining room they are greeted by the staff armed with huge
bowls of ginger candy and plastic bags (with Tax Free
Shopping logos) to throw up in

DARIUS (0OS)
Everybody let’s try to stay calm
and remain in your seats

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Ginger candy It’d good if you’re
seasick Stay calm everybody
everything is fine

One person grabs a handful and shoves it into his coat
pocket The British lady politely thanks them and carefully
selects two pieces Carl Yaya and most of the others are
unable to face the staff and simply stream past them like
zombies with ghastly white faces

Paula joins Crew Member carrying out the man with the heart
problem The man sits then passes out on the floor

PAULA
Is it a stroke Everybody stay
calm

Therese is wheeled past screaming

INT YACHT DINING ROOM - EVENING

The Captain is alone at the table He has finished his wine --
he takes someone’s abandoned glass and drinks it too

INT YACHT CABINS and CORRIDORS (VARIOUS) - EVENING 57

The Chief Stewardess helps Clementine and Winston to their
room Clementine vomits in the hallway Winston offers her
his hat where she deposits the next wave of vomit

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
That’s okay madam

WINSTON
I’m glad that hat came in useful

CLEMENTINE
I’m so sorry darling

WINSTON
No no It’s nothing at all

Once the door closes behind the guests’ backs Paula finally
gets to regroup

INT YACHT DINING ROOM - EVENING 58

The last of the ravaged guests have vacated the dining room
Apart from the wait staff busy clearing the tables only the
Captain remains with his burger And Dimitry who sits down
across from him

DIMITRY (0OS)
Hey

THE CAPTAIN
Oh hello

DIMITRY
You didn’t go swimming

THE CAPTAIN
Nope Aren’t you seasick

DIMITRY
You want to talk politics

THE CAPTAIN
No I definitely don’t want to
talk politics

Dimitry takes a seat on the opposite side of the table

DIMITRY
I have a joke Do you know how to
tell a Communist It’s someone who
reads Marx and Lenin And do you
know how to tell an anti-Communist
It’s someone who understands Marx
and Lenin It’s Ronald Reagan
Funny guy

CAPTAIN
“Never argue with an idiot they’1l
only bring you down to their level
and beat you with experience” Mark
Twain

DIMITRY
Ronald Reagan he said also
“Socialism works only in heaven
where they don’t need it and in
hell where they already have it”

CAPTAIN

That’s pretty good I’ve got one
here “Growth for the sake of
growth is the ideology of a cancer
cell” That’s Edward Abbey

DIMITRY

Listen “The problem with socialism
is that you eventually run out of
other people’s money” Margaret
Thatcher

CARL
You’re going to like this
one”The last capitalist we hand
will be the one who sold us the
rope” Karl Marx

They laugh together while things fall off the table and roll
away Reading quotes they have stored on their phones

DIMITRY
Oh Shit Okay Classic “The
most powerful single force in the
world today is the man’s eternal
desire to be free and independent”
Kennedy

CAPTAIN
Okay “Freedom in capitalist
society always remains about the
same as it was in Ancient Greece
Freedomfor slave owners”

Dimitry smiles widely pours them both some more wine

DIMITRY
I know Vladimir Lenin School A
Russian capitalist and an American
communist

INT YACHT (VARIOUS ROOMS) - EVENING

to-wall carpeting and on the stairs Someone slips ina
puddle of vomit Someone else sprays their cabin door with
vomit when the key card doesn’t work

DIMITRY (VO) (CONTD)
And as the communist captain we are
now setting course for Cuba We
want to discuss politics with you

The Captain wanders the hall with an armful of bottles He
hears the loudspeaker and hurries to his office

INT YACHT CAPTAIN’S CABIN - NIGHT

The Captain points at Dimitry in a “don’t you do that again”

Manner Dimitry wrestles the mic out of the Captains hand
again

CAPTAIN
Stop I am not a communist I’ma
marxist

DIMITRY

Or actually you don’t have a
choice Just like in a communist
dictatorship you have to listen
You can’t even turn off the volume
But I can

INT YACHT HALL - NIGHT
All over the ship people panic

The passengers are soiling their linen outfits and the
Italian silk sheets They fill the toilets and shower with
crap

Guests are lined up sitting against the walls in the hallway
wearing life jackets

DIMITRY (VO)
Karl Marx wrote “The Communist
Manifesto” So you are a communist

CAPTAIN (VO)
No No There’s a difference

DIMITRY (VO)
In materialism you believe in
theory You are an idealist

CAPTAIN (VO)
This thing is on Sorry But while
I have you let me just say that we
are not on our way to tax paradise
that’s for sure

(MORE )

CAPTAIN (VO) (CONTD)
We all know about your tax planing
your tax avoidance you don’t pay
your fair share

DIMITRY (VO)
Stop bullshit and pay taxes

CAPTAIN
Yes that is from your resident
Russian capitalist pig

Vera clings to the toilet in her underwear As the ship
rocks Vera slides across the floor that is wet with her own
vomit

The Captain takes a sip of rum

CAPTAIN (VO)
I’m not angry with you it’s just
like Karl Marx said “Anything
human is not alien to me” And I
understand that your greedy
behavior is just the result of your
position in a financial hierarchy
That you’re rich but you can’t be
rich and expect the rest of the
world to be poor
And while you’re swimming in
abundance the rest of the world is
drowning in misery That’s not the
way it’s meant to be And I know
you have a good heart in there
somewhere You filthy capitalist
Russian pig You have a good heart
Youre not just a crazy
Russianshit seller I’m not a
great I’m a shit socialist because
I have too much I have too much
abundance in my life I’m not a
worthy socialist I’m a shit
socialist

Soon someone’s banging on the door to the bridge it’s the
Chief Stewardess Paula and Darius The door is locked

The Russian then turns to the Captain and motions for him to
go on The Captain starts leafing through the book

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Open the door Is it locked
Thomas

DARIUS
Open the door Open the door
Thomas

CAPTAIN
I’m so sorry that was
irresponsible

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA (VO)
Open the door Let us talk open
the door

The men inside ignore the shouting on the other side of the
door

INT YACHT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

While the Captain is busy “preaching” a crew of six Filipino
cleaning ladies wearing lab masks march into the dining
room They clean the mess methodically One of them has
headphones on We move in on her ear and one of the earbuds
She’s listening to Rage Against The Machine “Killing In The
Name” As she’s wiping up vomit under a table the music
becomes more and more distinct

“Now you do what they told ya Now you do what they told
ya And now you do what they told ya”

Somewhere at this point the audience should - depending on
their capacity for empathy - feel that the passengers have
had enough We don’t want to see any more vomit We want
mercy for them At that very moment trough Vera we realize
that they are not only seasick they are suffering from food
poisoning as well and now they desperately need to take a
shit

VERA
Mama Uaaahhhhh Help

We see panic in their eyes as they dash back into the filthy
toilets right when “Killing In The Name” swells to its first
climax

The plumbing goes on the fritz and starts backing up into the
hallway

Shit and vomit start welling up from the toilets drains and
sinks Slime is oozing along the walls and out to the
carpeted areas

The passengers panic and try to get away from the stench and
incredible filth

They don’t stand a chance against nature and their bodily

impulses They spew at both ends uncontrollably and

everywhere

Carl and Yaya hold hands in their life jackets

INT YACHT CAPTAINS CABIN - NIGHT

Dimitry and Chief Stewardess Paula argue through the door

The Captain turns back on the microphone

CAPTAIN (VO)
How people perceive themselves is
nothing that interests me There
are few that are gonna look in the
mirror and say “The person I see
is a savage monster” Instead they
make up some construction that
justifies what they do An there it
is You’re rich so you’re a
philanthropist so you can cure
your conscience of not paying
enough in tax Not contributing
enough to society

The shit river flows through the halls

INT YACHT HALL - NIGHT

Paula and Darius gather at the breaker box Suddenly the

lights go out

INT YACHT CAPTAIN’S CABIN - NIGHT

The Captain and Dimitry gather with the light from a cell

phone

CAPTAIN
I want to read you something that I
wrote Come over here Bring the
light

DIMITRY
Okay

CAPTAIN
And I recall I was seven years old
walking into the kitchen to find my
mother crying inconsolably Martin
Luther King has been shot

(MORE )

CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
Two months later she was crying
again Bobby Kennedy was killed I
couldn’t know then what I know now
that the invisible thread
connecting Martin Luther King the
Kennedy brothers and Malcolm xX
was that in each case my
government had their finger on the
trigger

DIMITRY
Wait Wait

Dimitry turns on the Tannoy loudspeaker Outside the sun is
rising

DIMITRY (CONT’D)
Say it again

CAPTAIN
My government murdered Martin
Luther King Malcom X Bobby
Kennedy and John F Kennedy My
government overthrew good honest
democratic leaders of the people in
Chile Venezuela Argentina Peru
El Salvador Nicaragua Panama and
Bolivia Along with Britain we
carved up the Middle East creating
artificial geographical boundaries
and installing puppet dictators
War itself became our most
lucrative industry Every bomb
dropped somebody makes a million
dollars You don’t have to know
where those bombs are exploding
You don’t have to see the grieving
mothers and the mangled bodies of
their children

touches her foot She looks surprised and picks it up

CLEMENTINE

PART THREE - THE ISLAND

EXT ISLAND BEACH - DAY

Jarmo sits with someone that is passed out on the sand It’s
a beautiful woman It’s Yaya The dress she wore to the
Captain’s Dinner is soaked through one shoe is missing and
shes using her life vest as a pillow Jarmo takes another
look at his surroundings When he can’t see anyone else
around he reaches out and gently caresses her cheek

THERESE (0S)
In den Wolken Uli

He freezes and listens did he hear something

THERESE (CONT’D)
Uli In den Wolken

Jarmo gets up halfway and looks towards the beach behind his
back and sees Dimitry Carl and Chief Stewardess Paula
fighting the waves dragging a life raft behind them Therese
and NELSON are in it

THERESE (CONT’D)
In den Wolken Uli

They all pitch in to try to lift the raft onto the beach Its
not easy the waves are powerful and they are all exhausted
Therese is frightened and confused she looks around as if
she was missing someone Paula tries to comfort her

Dimitry focuses on the Unknown Man
DIMITRY
Who are you Hey hey you Hey I’m
talking to you

NELSON
Me

DIMITRY
Yeah Who are you

NELSON
I work on the boat

DIMITRY
You work on the boat

Dimitry moves closer the Pirate knows that he has to push it
now

DIMITRY

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

Carl and Yaya find each other on the beach He guides her
toward the group

NELSON
I’m calm I’m calm What’s the
problem with you man You think I’m
a pirate Just because I’m black
you think I’m a pirate That’s it

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Don’t go there

DIMITRY
You can cry on my shoulder

NELSON
He comes to me with his big watch
and says I’m a pirate just because
I’m black What’s the problem with
you man

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
He hasn’t said anything about you
being black You’re calling him

NELSON

eyes

DIMITRY

NELSON

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

DIMITRY

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
I think you should just calm down

up the situation Just stay calm
and stay positive

DIMITRY
He works in the engine room

The pirate is acting so well that even the audience should
start doubting But there is one person that must know
everybody turns to Paula She hesitates for a second

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
There’s a lot of people on the
boat We can’t see each other all
the time

EXT ISLAND CAMP - NIGHT

The group is now huddled together on the inflatable life raft
in a small clearing surrounded by trees In between the
flashes from the lights attached to the life raft and life
vests you can detect the ocean between the tree trunks but
other than that it’s pitch black Everyone is lying quietly
with their eyes closed but hunger and thirst make it hard to
fall asleep And soon their survival instincts will make it
even more difficult Through Yaya we will see that it all
begins with a sound so low that it is barely detectable
possibly even just a figment of her imagination But when she
hears it again chills run up and down her spine

The nature of the sound is animal and human threatening and
wailing at the same time At first it is repeated so
infrequently that they hope it will go away But it doesn’t
it becomes more and more frequent and louder

JARMO
Oh Ah

CARL
Easy easy

Jarmo’s outburst triggers the worst boutbox of howling so
far High on fear and adrenaline they all howl in
desperation out into the black night When they stop all
they can hear is their own panting

YAYA
Be quiet

They fall apart screaming and running towards the beach
Left behind in the raft is the paralyzed Therese

THERESE
IN DEN WOLKEN

EXT ISLAND BEACH - NIGHT

When the others reach the beach they fall down on their
knees and start to pray Someone lights the emergency flare -
it shoots up into the sky

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
No don’t use the flares It’s our
last flare Don’t use the flare

Out of breath and terrified they pray in a variety of
languages and employing various mantras a murmuring chorus
of soul-searching that lasts for over a minute

EXT ISLAND BEACH - DAY

Carl wakes up all rattled as if he’d been woken in the
middle of a nightmare He looks over at the sleeping Yaya
Her face is covered with sand flea bites Carl sits up to
inspect his own body - he doesn’t seem to have gotten a
single bite When he turns to look in the other direction
along the beach he sees Jarmo yelling

JARMO
Hey

CARL
What

JARMO
Look

CARL

Oh shit Yaya wake up wake up

As the others wakes up Carl heads off Once they see what
he’s running towards they hurry up and follow him

JARMO
Look

From afar we see how the group stumbles towards the cliffs
at the end of the beach When they made it to about three
quarters of the distance a camera movement reveals where they
are heading One of the covered orange lifeboats from the
yacht has washed ashore The hull is intact but the rudder
and the propeller are missing Carl reaches it first climbs
up on the tiny deck grabs the handle on the hatch and tries
to open it It is locked He shades his eyes to see if he can
make anything out through the fogged- up plastic window The
others gather round the boat as Carl begins to knock on the
window

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
There’s water in there Is it
closed

JARMO

DIMITRY

Abigail surveys the cases of water contemplating her
options

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA (CONT’D)

Abigail then begins to lift the heavy case of water and hands
it to Paula The other islanders try and grab it

they realize that they have left her behind

EXT ISLAND BEACH - DAY
Therese is dragged over in her life raft

The group is sitting on the beach spraying their mouths with
the water spray and eating what’s left of the potato chips
They are all watching as Abigail catches an octopus

DIMITRY
Bravo Bravo

CARL

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

More staring

EXT ISLAND CAMP - NIGHT

It’s dusk and the group is gathered around a campfire
Therese is sitting in her life raft Carefully they study
Abigail as she prepares and cooks the fish Despite their
hunger there are no conflicts but when the fish are to be
portioned out frustration starts building Abigail begins
portioning out the octopus

ABIGAIL

One for you One for me One for
you One for me One for you One

goes to retrieve more when Abigail stops her

ABIGAIL

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
No maybe not enough but we need
to work together They don’t know
how to do that

ABIGAIL
Exactly And maybe that’s why you
should not be so lazy and dependent
on me

Abigail collects her food in her shirt and holds it close

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
AbigailI think youre forgetting
that you and I are employed of a
big ship company Remember In the
end I’m responsible for the safety
of the guests You have to do what

ABIGAIL

Ma’am PaulaWith respect to your
expertise in this situation I would

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Sure

ABIGAIL
My suggestion is that the boys stay
her and watch the fire and take
care of madame

ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
While you ma’am Paula and you
sleep with me in the lifeboat

She points at Yaya and Paula and glares slightly at the men
They are diminished as they sit there on the ground Abigail
takes a step closer

Dimitry Jarmo Carl and Nelson watch the women head for the
boat

That blood-curdling animal-humanoid cry rings out again in
the distance

INT ISLAND BEACH LIFEBOAT - NIGHT

Yaya Paula and Abigail are gathering towels for the others
when someone knocks on the hatch It’s Dimitry and Jarmo
pleading dangling their exclusive watches in front of the
window

EXT ISLAND - NIGHT

Carl Nelson and Therese are all sitting around the camp
site scared to fall asleep Abigail’s backpack comes into
view - it has been close by only no one had discovered it
before the campfire revealed it Carl looks at it for a while
before he opens the zipper and finds a bag of pretzels
inside He puts the bag back and turns his face away as if he
was trying to erase the memory of its existence But after
sitting down for a while he seeks eye contact with Nelson
and Therese

CARL

Nelson she left the bag
NELSON

Huh
CARL

She left the bag

NELSON
What’s in it

CARL
Pretzel sticks

Nelson goes over to the backpack to open it

CARL (CONTD)
No we can’t have it

NELSON
I’m just going to have a look
Alright

CARL

We can’t No

NELSON
Wait

He goes back to the backpack unzips it and takes a look

CARL
What are you doing

Carl looks very skeptical
NELSON
Maybe If we just make a little
hole here Take two out One each
They’1l never notice it

CARL
Okay let me try

They carefully poke a small hole at the top corner of the box
and slowly take out two tiny pretzel sticks for each of them
Giggling

Therese motions to them and they give her one

They eat them quickly Then sit in silence

CARL (CONT’D)
Shall we just have one more

They grab the pretzel bag again

EXT ISLAND BEACH - MORNING

Dimitry struggles against the waves to drag something in from
the water He sits on the beach holds it weeps over it

It is Vera’s corpse

He strokes her necknotices her diamond necklace

He pushes her up so he can unclasp the necklace and pockets
it

EXT ISLAND CAMP - MORNING

The fire has gone out and the sun has risen a fair amount
above the horizon With a commanding presence Abigail is
standing in front of Carl and Nelson Yaya and Paula teaming

up behind her

ABIGAIL
So what happened here

CARL
We made a mistake with

ABIGAIL
Why

CARL
We just fell asleep

ABIGAIL
Now I won’t have enough time to go
fishing because I have to make
another fire It takes a lot of
work to make a fire you know

CARL
Yeah yeah We know

ABIGAIL
Okay Let’s get this day started
Come on everybody Let’s go

ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
Wait wait wait There’s one more
thing

She leaves the group places a hand on the pirate’s shoulder
as she passes behind his back walks over to the log and
picks up her backpack

ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
Last night we left our backpack
here and well we’re not sure but

pretzel sticks You didn’t take it

CARL
No

ABIGAIL
Are you sure

NELSON
Yeah we’re sure Come on Why are
you accusing us

ABIGAIL
No I’m not accusing you I’m just
making sure because

Abigail walks over to the burnt-out fire and picks up the
partially charred empty box of pretzels

ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
What’s this

CARL
Well we didn’t

ABIGAIL
You didn’t

NELSON
No we didn’t

ABIGAIL
And youre sure you didn’t

Abigail’s stern look pushes the pirate into the painful
corner of shame It makes him look like the dog from the
YouTube clip “Denver - the official guilty dog”

NELSON

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA

ABIGAIL
Yes Ma’am Paula This is really

sticks

YAYA
Yeah and lie about it

ABIGAIL
And not just to me but to
everybody here How can we trust
you after what you did

CARL
I need to say something now

ridiculous

Carl becomes animated and starts talking angrily with his
hands Yaya Paula and Abigail look at Carl with stern eyes

CARL (CONT’D)

Don’t point at her Put your hands
down

CARL
Okay alright Just let me say

ABIGAIL
Put your hands down

YAYA

CARL
I’m trying to defend myself

YAYA
Don’t defend yourself You are
inflicting pain on her by defending
yourself

ISLAND MAIN BEACH - DAY

Carl is anxiously looking for food in a pile of trash and
belongings from the ship wreck He finds something that
catches his eye

CARL
Shut the fuck up No

Carl finds the same cologne that he modeled for in the
campaign years ago

EXT ISLAND MAIN BEACH - NIGHT

Paula Yaya and Abigail are walking down the beach holding
what appears to be multiple fish that Abigail has caught
Dimitry runs to catch up with them

DIMITRY
What a nice fish huh

ABIGAIL
Yes We have a lot

DIMITRY
So it’s dinner huh Great
Where did you get it

ABIGAIL
There at the back of the rock

DIMITRY
You’re good at that

ABIGAIL
Thank you

Abigail walks ahead of the group

DIMITRY
You need help

YAYA
Yeah sure get some Nutella

Dimitry catches up with Abigail and shines a flashlight for
her

ABIGAIL
Oh thank you

EXT ISLAND CAMP - NIGHT

Darkness has once again enveloped the island Our group of
hungry castaways is sitting around the campfire eating Carl
and the pirate now known as Nelson are being punished and
will not be receiving anything to eat but their empty
bellies have them hoping They watch as the others eat

Carl and the pirate now known as Nelson are being punished
and will not be receiving anything to eat but their empty
bellies have them hoping They watch the others eat but not
everyone is fully occupied by food Yaya feels guilty she
has a hard time looking at Carl But suddenly she notices
something unexpected Carl’s gaze is fixed on someone else
there at the campfire She leans forward to see who it might
be Is he looking at the cleaning lady He is looking at her
She studies Carl’s expression It’s not hostile or anything
like that it’s more like he wants to get her attention With
the image of Carl’s expression branded on her consciousness
Yaya looks down at her food a second before looking sideways
to study him in secret He’s still looking at the cleaning
lady and now he does a slow blink with both eyes The woman
responds with a smile Yaya stops eating A queasy sort of
feeling is overpowering the hunger in her gut Is Carl
flirting with the cleaning lady How long has this been going
on The cleaning lady looks up at Carl a third time and by
now his gaze is stirring up a reaction in her Does he really
mean her Carl starts using body language puckering his lips
just a little and smiling The cleaning lady smiles back a
bit self- consciously She averts her eyes momentarily and
then looks up again with more confidence Now she holds his
gaze for two seconds before she blinks softly with both eyes
The flirt is on Yaya watching all of this

YAYA
What

Yaya gets up She gives Carl a brief glance before she leaves
the campfire and heads for the shore The others look up from
their meal What’s up Did anything in particular happen or
is she simply answering nature’s call

CARL
Yaya Wait wait

YAYA
Dickhead Piss off

Abigail takes a size-able chunk of grilled fish that hasn’t
been assigned yet She folds it up in a palm leaf gets up
and yawns

ABIGAIL
Okay I’m going to the lifeboat
now Ma’am Paula can you stay here
and watch the fire

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
Sure

ABIGAIL
And since Carl didn’t eat anything
today he can sleep with me in the
lifeboat

CARL
Okay yeah

NELSON
Can I come

CARL
Abigail can we both come or

ABIGAIL
No just you

Carl looks slightly embarrassed then gets up and joins her
The rest of the group is confused - what’s going on here

EXT ISLAND BEACH - NIGHT

Yaya has left the others sitting on a rock at the left end
of the beach She’s frustrated and upset soon she will be
feeling even worse From a distance you can see Carl running
towards her with a bag of pretzels

YAYA
Fine Ill take the pretzels

Carl winces when he sees how flea-bitten Yaya’s face is

CARL
You’re making this into an issue
Are you going to take them Yes
take them Good Why are you making
this into an issue I’m coming One

second

YAYA
What are you going to do on the
boat

CARL

I’m gonna do it of course
YAYA
Really

CARL
Yes

YAYA

What do you think she wants with
you You’re a young hot guy What

Abigail blows a whistle from the lifeboat Carl and Yaya
fight over the pretzels

CARL
Okay then give them back

YAYA
No No

CARL
Let me take them back

YAYA
No And they’re mine okay

CARL
Take a few and I’1ll take them
back because I don’t want to do
this It’s not a good idea

YAYA

CARL
You need to tell me what to do You
need to tell me how to navigate

YAYA

Just laugh are her jokes and smile

CARL
Okay

YAYA

CARL
Yeah

YAYA
And nothing sexual okay

CARL

YAYA

CARL

Yaya cries alone in the dark
EXT ISLAND BEACH - MORNING
Carl climbs out of the lifeboat

CARL (CONTD)

Yaya passes by

YAYA

CARL
Oh morning

YAYA
Asshole

CARL

Yaya Yaya wait Wait
EXT ISLAND BEACH - MONTAGE

Here follows a collage of Carl repeatedly exiting the
lifeboat after spending the nights with Abigail Sometimes
it’s sunny sometimes it’s cloudy once it’s raining From
the beginning Carl is carefully making sure that no one
catches him with the pretzel sticks As the days pass he
becomes more relaxed

EXT ISLAND BEACH - DAY (PART OF MONTAGE)

The collage will be intercut with a discussions between Jarmo
and Therese sitting on the beach During the discussion they

relate to Carl and Abigail that is in the life boat somewhere
in front of them and Jarmo and Dimitry who are poking fun of

Carl in the background

JARMO
Pretty boy We can see you

NELSON
Have you ever used your

Nelson points to her body asking Therese if she has ever
used sex to gain something

NELSON (CONT’D)
When you were young

Theres shyly nods yes

NELSON (CONT’D)
Oh you slept with somebody to get
a job No you didn’t Really

Theres holds up one finger

NELSON (CONT’D)
Once ThereseWow

Cut to Dimitry and Jarmo who are taunting Carl by blowing the
whistle Abigail uses to call him to the lifeboat Carl is
pushing them around to try and get the whistle back

CARL
Where is it Give it to me Give me
the whistle now So childish

All the men laugh

EXT ISLAND HIGH GRASS AREA - DAY

Nelson pushes some branches aside and slowly leans in to
check the bushes in front of him

Dimitry and Jarmo are watching him a couple of meters from
behind All of a sudden there’s a rustling sound followed
by the animal-humanoid cry Nelson gasps and hurries back to
the others

NELSON
Hey

DIMITRY
Pirate What was it

NELSON
Did you see it

DIMITRY
What was it

NELSON
I don’t know what it is

With mixed feelings they turn away from the animal At that
very moment Yaya is coming up to the men from behind

YAYA
What’s going on

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
They’re hunting something

NELSON
No We don’t go there What Come
on guys

JARMO
Nelson give me that

The others look at him in surprise Suddenly Jarmo has puffed
himself up

NELSON
Are you sure

Nelson hands him the sharpened stick Jarmo weighs the stick
in his hands only to throw it aside and pick up a large rock
instead With a serious expression on his face he proceeds
to stalk his prey

JARMO
It’s a female

DIMITRY
Kill it

Using all of his might Jarmo smashes it over the head with
the rock Jarmo thinks he killed the animal Dimitry Jarmo
and Nelson celebrate when Paula notices something

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
It’s moving It’s moving It’s not
dead

Jarmo takes two careful steps back towards the animal

NELSON
What’s he doing

CHIEF STEWARDESS PAULA
No no no

Jarmo begins smashing the animal with the rock repeatedly
The animal now revealed to be a donkey finally dies Jarmo
is left shaken up and covered in blood Dimitry and Nelson go
over to comfort him
DIMITRY
Hey you did it

EXT ISLAND FLAT CLIFF WALL - NIGHT

Everybody has now gathered in a half circle around a fire
facing a smooth rock wall

DIMITRY
Hunter Jarmo Big hunter Give him
applause

Everybody cheers

YAYA
The donkey fairytale

Jarmo is standing in front of the others prepared to give a
dramatic speech illuminated by the flames from the fire

JARMO
Thank you very much Okay to kill
a donkey it may be a great
achievement but there’s one thing
that’s so much greater

YAYA
To paint

JARMO

To paint yes To paint a donkey
Let’s take a look at the
expression Who did this one

Jarmo steps back exposing the rock wall With pieces of
charcoal from the fire there is a drawing of a donkey on the
wall

YAYA

JARMO
Okay the feet are close together
This donkey wants to be in control
but it looks almost scared You
want to tell this donkey to not be
so scared To lose control and
bound away across the fields
wildly waiving its tail Sure it
will make mistakes

It is an expression of displeasure very clearly directed at
Abigail and Carl who now feel cornered Carl wants to
acknowledge Abigail but is unwilling to do it in front of
Yaya A hand on Carl’s thigh a kiss on his cheek Every
physical gesture creates a painful dilemma for Carl This
wordless drama plays out at the same time as Jarmo is
commenting the different drawings on the rock wall

YAYA
Carl what are you doing
CARL
Huh
YAYA
Carl
CARL
Yeah
YAYA
What are you doing with your hand
CARL
Which one
YAYA
Seriously
CARL

I’m just resting it on the chair

YAYA
Why is your hand under her jacket
on a chair

CARL
What It was just I don’t know
it was there resting on the side
of the chair

INT ISLAND BEACH LIFEBOAT - NIGHT
Carl and Abigail are tangled up under the mosquito net

ABIGAIL
I’m coming I’m coming

CARL
I can’t concentrate

Abigail turns around and covers herself with some towels

ABIGAIL
Okay you know if you can’t handle
it just tell me Nobody’s forcing
you to do anything

CARL
It’s just all this fucking sneaking
around and hiding things from
everyone It’s too much It’s
becoming unbearable I mean
they’re obviously not happy with
what we’re doing in here

ABIGAIL
Okay so Let’s just tell them the
truth You give me something and I
give you something in return

CARL
You realize what position that puts
me in

ABIGAIL
No

CARL

Well just because it’s more open
that you’re a flesh peddler it
doesn’t mean they’re going to
accept the fact that you’re buying
sex with common food

ABIGAIL
Wow

CARL
Oh come on I didn’t

ABIGAIL
Do you know the amount of work I
put into this island I go fishing
every day I make fire

CARL
I know I know
ABIGAIL
I’m responsible for everybody here
CARL
I know I’m sorry I know
ABIGAIL
Shouldn’t that give me an
advantage
CARL

Yeah yeah of course You deserve
to do what you want I know The
absurd thing that if we were a
couple they wouldn’t care what we
did in here Maybe we should just
do that maybe we should just get
on with it Kiss a little bit in
public and hold hands Surely that
would be easier

ABIGAIL
What about Yaya

CARL
I would have a conversation with
Yaya I would have to be an adult
about it and figure it out I think
it would be easier for her
probably I mean she’s have to
deal with all this gossip as well

ABIGAIL
Carl I don’t know
CARL
Do you want me to break up with
Yaya
ABIGAIL
No
CARL
No
ABIGAIL

That’s your decision not mine
CARL
I’m not asking you to do it I’m
just seeing what you think about
it

ABIGAIL
I know but that doesn’t mean that
you can put me in-between the two
of you

CARL
It’s kind of a perfect scenario for
you I mean You get what you
want you have no obligations no
responsibilities you know

ABIGAIL
What do you have to make everything
so complication

CARL
Because I feel like I need to know
where this is going Abigail

ABIGAIL
Let’s just have fun

CARL
No but I need to try and deal with
this situation I don’t want to
piss off anyone anymore

ABIGAIL
Do you remember what you said the
first night you were here What did
you say

CARL
“I love you you give me fish”

ABIGAIL
Exactly And so you know why that
is so beautiful Like you

CARL
No Why

ABIGAIL
Because it’s the truth

EXT SHORE - MORNING

Nelson shaves Dimitry’s face with a straight razor on the

beach

DIMITRY
So Nelson you’re a pirate huh

NELSON
Come on stop it Okay If I was a
pirate what would you ask me

DIMITRY
How much money do you make

NELSON
Yeah of course I don’t know
like 3000 euros

DIMITRY

On one attack
NELSON

Yeah one attack If we succeed
DIMITRY

So you work on commission huh
NELSON

Yeah
DIMITRY

Shit The client is making all the
money

NELSON
Yeah but you can make more if you
have your own boat

DIMITRY
3000 euros Come on you’re crazy
NELSON
My girlfriend is expensive
DIMITRY
What You invest in your
girlfriend
NELSON

Yeah

DIMITRY
You should do it the other way
around Invest in business buy a
boat and the girls will come to
you

NELSON
Yeah

DIMITRY
Sure I know

They laugh together

INT ISLAND BEACH LIFEBOAT - DAY

A hard knock on the hatch of the lifeboat wakes up Abigail
and Carl laying naked and tight together under the mosquito
net As Carl get up from the bunk and wipes away the steam on
the inside of the shutter he sees Yayas face waiting
outside

YAYA
Hey I was just wondering if I
could borrow the backpack

Carl looks briefly at Abigail

CARL
Abigail

ABIGAIL
Yeah I know What are you going to
do Yaya

YAYA
Go for a hike over the mountain
See if I can find something

Abigail gets up from the bunk

ABIGAIL
I’1l go with you

YAYA
It’s okay I can go by myself

ABIGAIL
No Yaya it’s not safe for you to
go alone I’11 go with you

YAYA
Okay

Carl looks at Abigail

CARL
Do you want me to come

ABIGAIL
No You stay here I need some time
alone with her

CARL
Yeah

ABIGAIL
Yeah

They kiss and Abigail climbs out of the boat Through the
glass window Carl sees how Yaya and Abigail disappear into
the jungle vegetation

EXT ISLAND JUNGLE PATH - DAY

Carefully Yaya makes her way through the thick vegetation
with the machete Abigail is a few steps behind her Now and
then she looks at Yaya as if she would like to say
something

ABIGAIL
I’m glad we’re doing this together
Yaya

YAYA

Me too I just want to tell you
that I’m really impressed with
everything you’re doing here I
mean you managed to run a fucking
matriarchy Abigail You
domesticated all the old alpha
males No it’s really impressive

Abigail seems unsure of how to take Yaya’s words and tries to
downplay them

ABIGAIL
We should stick together huh
EXT ISLAND STEEP MOUNTAIN - DAY

Yaya and Abigail reach a steep mountain peak Abigail is
growing weary

YAYA
I think it should be a little
easier from here

When it comes to climbing Yaya is the faster one and as she
rounds a corner she disappears out of sight

EXT ISLAND CAMP (and BEACH) - DAY

Therese is all alone in the lifeboat beached in the clearing
in the trees She gazes towards the sea as if she were
looking for the others Suddenly through the foliage she
notices something moving further down the beach

THERESE
Il den Wolken

As it approaches the opening in the thicket we see patterns
and flashes of color It looks like someone carrying bags
swatches of cloth sunglasses Panama hats

THERESE (CONT’D)
Il den Wolken

On the beach about 50 meters from Therese a beach vendor
comes walking with his entire assortment Therese can hardly
believe her eyes she gets excited and starts to shout louder
and louder The vendor looks up and heads over to Therese

THERESE (CONT’D)
Il den volken

Therese is out of breath but tries to smile towards him and
gesture that he should come closer with her movable left
hand The beach vendor sits down and lines up his wares in
front of her

NATIVE MAN
Louis Vuitton Chanel

THERESE
In den Wolken Nien nien

Therese is desperate The beach vendor looks questioningly at
her She grabs at his arm and he backs away Collects his
things and leaves muttering while Therese screams after him

EXT ISLAND STEEP HILLSIDE - DAY
Yaya and Abigail is now moving slowly forward on a brushy

steep hillside close to the ocean You can tell by their
steps that they are growing weary

The waves rumble into the cliffs 40 meters below them if
they trip it would be all over

YAYA
Abigail I see something

Yaya’s voice was shrill That makes the pause before her
response

ABIGAIL
What I can’t hear you

YAYA
Abigail Hurry up

ABIGAIL
I’m coming

YAYA
Abigail

ABIGAIL
Yaya

YAYA

Abigail Abigail there’s an
elevator It’s a resort Abigail

An elevator Did she hear right Abigail stops and listens
then she starts to hurry to catch up on Yaya

ABIGAIL
A what

EXT ISLAND UNEXPLORED BEACH - DAY

It takes a little while for her to climb down the rock When
she reaches Yaya she has sunk down in the sand At the
bottom of the cliff twenty meters away an elevator entrance
in blasted steel is built into the rock wall On the small
beach a dozen sun chairs

Yaya laughs wildly

YAYA
It’s a resort Come look It’s a
luxury resort It’s been there the
whole time It’s been there the
whole fucking time Abigail Come
come Abigail

Abigail isn’t anywhere near as thrilled as Yaya but she
realizes she needs to play along She sits down patting the
space next to her

ABIGAIL
Let’s enjoy this moment

Yaya smiles back and sits down beside Abigail takes a deep
breath and exhales

YAYA
It’s surreal huh

ABIGAIL
Yeah

YAYA
You must be excited to see your
kids huh

Yaya smiles tenderly and Abigail shivers at the thought of
how fast things can change - that smile it was like a
multitude of smiles she’d encountered on the cruise yachts
It was a smile of compassionate superiority No hierarchies
would be changed by what essentially is pity Maybe it’s the
smile that makes her mind up

ABIGAIL
I don’t have kids

YAYA
Sorry Let’s go
ABIGAIL
I need to wee-wee and then we will

go

Abigail starts walking towards a small cluster of trees at
the back of the beach While walking she turns around two
times to make sure that Yaya is not watching her When she
stops she picks up a large rock

She hefts it a few times and watches Yaya Then Abigail goes
back out on the beach Very slowly she closes in on Yaya
The girl’s hair her tanned back the sun slowly setting in
the sea - just like an Instagram post By the time Abigail is
only a few meters away something primitive comes over her
features She raises the rock over her head but doesn’t
follow through when Yaya starts talking

YAYA
Abigail Abigail I can try and
help you I don’t know how but

She says it without turning around Abigail lowers the rock
back to waist level again and stands there her chest
heaving We hear her heart beating We see the fierce
expression in her eyes how her nostrils flare
YAYA (CONT’D)
Abigail maybe you can come work
for me You could be my assistant

EXT ISLAND JUNGLE PATH - DAY

Carl runs as fast as he can through the woods
