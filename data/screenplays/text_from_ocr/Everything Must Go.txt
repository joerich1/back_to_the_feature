INT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

CLOSE on a stone paper weight sitting on a frosted glass
desk It is etched with the words “If you don’t hit the
target you don’t score”

NICK (VO)
I want to finish up with a
little refresher

CLOSE on a framed photograph of a couple holding up two first
prize ribbons shaped like fish Our view is cropped so we
don’t see the womans face

NICK (VO) (CONT’D)
I know you all have heard it
before but I’ve been going over
the May numbers and a little review
of the basics won’t hurt

CLOSE on a silver plated clock with a plaque underneath it
It reads “Nick Porter Most Inspirational Employee Dallas
Office 1996”

NICK (VO) (CONT’D)
So today I give you the “Five
Rules of Customer Service”

(a small group moan)

One - know your products Whether
it’s a PC or a piece of paper
Know how it works Know how to use
it Knowledge builds confidence

CLOSE on a photograph of four 35-45 year old men in red
shorts and tee shirts standing on a baseball field They
hold mitts and aluminum bats and raise beers to the camera

NICK (VO) (CONT’D)
Two —- Know your customers Learn
everything you can about them
Listen to what they want and what
they don’t want

CLOSE on a clear glass mug filled with steaming coffee A
white line cuts across the middle of the mug The text below
the line reads “this glass is now half empty”

NICK (VO) (CONT’D)
Three - Make sure someone always
answers the phone - Bob
(group chuckle)
WIDE of the office just like thousands of others across the

country

Beige carpet maple laminate furniture flat screen

PC and torchiere lamps Lots of glass to promote synergy

NICK (V0) (CONTD)
Four - Always give what you
promise Fail to deliver and you
will lose the customer

INT CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY

The lights are dimmed A group of regional sales managers
all in suits sit around a conference table watching a
Powerpoint presentation complete with graphs and printed
versions of the Five Rules of Sales

NICK PORTER hovering somewhere around 40 stands in front of
the screen his face bathed in the light of the projector as
he finishes up his talk

NICK
And the moment you’ve been waiting
for Five Go the extra yard If
you don’t have the answer Find
it Remember a journey of a
thousand miles begins with a single
step

The lights go up

NICK (CONTD)
Okay Let’s get those numbers up

As people leave the room Nick puts his stuff away He
notices his boss GARY early 30’s a dick who doesn’t think
he’s a dick standing by the door Nick walks up to him

NICK (CONTD)
Hey Gary I didn’t know you came to
these things anymore

They walk into the hall together

GARY

Solid presentation Nick
NICK

Thanks
GARY

Same one you gave last month right
INT GARYS OFFICE - DAY

Gary closes his door and sits behind his desk He settles in
and opens a file Nick sits on Gary’s couch It is low to
the ground and Nick has to sit awkwardly

GARY
Arkansas and New Mexico numbers are
up Oklahoma is still pretty flat

NICK
I think they’re finally getting it It
took a lot of work As for Oklahoma -

Nick laughs Gary doesn’t

GARY

GARY
Good Good Look Nick I know

routine Your practically wrote
our manual so I am going to get

decided to make a change

NICK
(interrupting)
Gary before you say anything I
want to go on record

GARY
You don’t have to go on record
NICK
I’ve been seeing my sponsor Going
to meetings My wife has been
completely supportive

GARY
Nick

NICK
I promised that my drinking would
be under control and it is

Gary looks down at his paperwork

GARY
Not in Denver apparently

NICK
I’m sorry

GARY
This is a delicate time with the
merger and all The higher ups
cannot afford bad press

NICK
I told you exactly what happened

GARY
And the company did their own
thorough investigation

NICK
I don’t know what you heard Gary
but I told you it wasn’t like that

GARY
When I get a phone call from our
lawyers at the main office I’ve
heard enough

NICK
Sales are up in all my markets

GARY
Not in Oklahoma

NICK
Just - look at the numbers

GARY
It isn’t about numbers anymore
NICK
This office has become a major
player because of me My record
reflects that

GARY
(going through a file)
Your record 1998 One month paid
leave for alcohol counseling

(pointing to the file)
Honestly this is the reason I’m
sitting here and you are over
there

NICK
Gary please

GARY
You’ve been a huge asset to this
corporation No one is going to
deny that

NICK
Sixteen years I’ve given sixteen
years of my life to this company

GARY
And the company has rewarded you
for your loyalty Listen this
mess will clear up You’re stilla
young guy You’ve got a great
wife You’re well liked in the
community You’1ll bounce back

He pauses and takes something out of his desk

GARY (CONTD)
Mr Goodson and the rest of the
higher ups wanted you to have this
as a token of their appreciation

Gary leans over the desk and hands Nick a small giftwrapped
box As Nick stares at the box the sound drains away until
Gary can barely be heard
GARY (CONTD)
(muted)
You can keep the corporate car
through the end of the month
Health benefits too

CLOSE on the box

GARY (CONTD)
Your files are corporate property

CLOSE on Gary’s lips moving

GARY (CONT’D)
But you can take three file boxes
containing personal items with you

The sound fades back up

GARY (CONT’D)
I think that covers it

Gary stands up to shake Nick’s hand Nick doesn’t move Gary
waits awkwardly After what seems like a minute Nick speaks

NICK
Gary I always taught you when you
want to shitcan somebody you go to
their office That way when they
start begging for their miserable
job back you can leave and go back
to your office

Gary smiles nervously fearing that Nick might snap

Instead Nick stands up across from Gary smiling tightly
He shakes Gary’s hand hard Too hard

NICK (CONTD)
I wish you the best in all of your
endeavors and hope that we get the
chance to work together again

He finally lets go and walks out of a relieved Gary’s office
He pauses outside the glass door for a moment Gathers
himself

EXT OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY
Summer in Texas The sun bakes Nick’s corporate car a blue

Crown Victoria Nick sits inside biding his time AC on
waiting for the workday to end
INT NICKS CROWN VICTORIA - DAY
Nick dials his cellphone
NICK
Hey honey It’s me Just
finishing up lunch I’m going to
try and make it home early Maybe
we can go out for dinner Okay

Nick puts the phone down He drums his fingers nervously on
the steering wheel He looks at his glove compartment

NICK (CONTD)
(to himself)
Stop Stop Stop Be smart

He looks at the glove compartment again He opens it He
stares at something inside Shakes his head He looks pained

Nick reaches in the glove compartment and pulls out a flask
He quickly unscrews the top and takes a hard pull

INT NICKS CROWN VICTORIA - LATER

CLOSE on the flask Now lying empty on the passenger seat
CLOSE on the box Gary gave him sitting on the dashboard
Nick stares at it It appears he has been doing this for a
while Nick takes the box in his hand He slowly unties the
ribbon Carefully tears off the paper Opens the lid He
stares inside the box

Nick takes out a Swiss Army Knife It is engraved with the
company’s corporate logo on one side Nick turns it in his

hand His initials are on the other side

Nick holds the knife up to get a better look He flips the
tools up and down Saw Magnifying glass Tweezers Knife

He looks out the window Exits the Crown Vic

EXT OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY

Nick walks purposefully passing by an entire aisle of Crown
Victoria’s He stops

ANGLE ON

A new yellow Mustang GT Gary’s car Nick looks around the
parking lot for signs of life
He bends down by the driver side door

CLOSE on the tire as the Swiss Army Knife plunges into it
Nick smiles as the air HISSES out

His work done he tries to pull the blade out

It won’t budge

Nick hears VOICES He pops his head up and sees people are
leaving the office The lunch crowd He yanks on the knife
hard It’s stuck He has to make a choice

Nick crab walks away from the car We stay on the knife and
the initials “NAP” as Gary’s tire slowly deflates

EXT TEXAS SUPERHIGHWAY - DAY

Nick commutes home leaving the city and heading for the
suburbs His shirt sleeves are rolled up and his tie is
loose He cranks the stereo and listens to some Herbie Mann-
ish jazz as he holds the wheel in one hand and dangles his

arm out the window as if he didn’t have a care in the world

Nick travels outside the city We see exit signs for the
635 A twisted maze of on-ramps and off-ramps

Arapaho Road The 190 West 15th Street

EXT W 15TH ST OFF-RAMP - DAY

The Crown Vic exits the highway careening a bit as if the
driver may have forgotten his exit

EXTINT CROWN VICTORIA - DAY

Nick drives through the outskirts of Plano Texas An upper
middle class suburb of Dallas There’s a Home Depot a
Target Olive Garden Applebee’s and a Starbucks

EXT 11 PARKING LOT - DAY

Nick pulls in fast and hard Two TEENAGERS barely move as he
hits the concrete parking divider in front of the store
almost rolling over it Nick exits and gives them a nod as
he goes inside
Through the window we watch Nick He grabs two twelve packs
of beer Fish food A bag of Doritos He passes by the
Slurpee machine Stops Goes back and gets one

He pays at the register

Nick exits The teenagers comes up to him One is big
steroid big the other lanky Both are baked

LANKY TEENAGER
Hey bro’ I’1l give you ten bucks
for one of those twacks

NICK
Sorry

He can’t get his key in the door He’s a little drunk

LANKY TEENAGER
C’mon We have cash

BIG TEENAGER
(snickers )
You sure don’t need it

NICK
(getting frustrated)
Aren’t you a little young to be
drinking beers

The big teen steps in He slaps the Slurpee out of Nick’s
hand It splashes all over Nick’s pants staining them red

BIG TEENAGER
Aren’t you a little old to be
drinking Slurpees fucklips

Nick stares at the kids He gets in his car As Nick pulls
out the big teen fakes chasing him

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Nick sips on a beer as he drives through a neighborhood with
large new homes

Nick drives through a neighborhood with smaller older homes
They are still substantial and well kept and all variations
on a theme - Ranch style Navajo White Stucco Green
lawns With large front yards and ample space they are the
reason people like Nick commute an hour each way to work

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - DAY

Nick pulls his car into a driveway We don’t see his house

just his garage He kills the engine but doesn’t get out He
just sits there Looking at something outside the passenger

window that we cannot see

He turns the music down

He gets out of the car and starts walking towards the house

The camera DOLLIES with him to reveal what he has been
staring at

The trappings of his life His furniture Clothes Stereo
Record collection Baseball cards Tiki bar Poker table
Replica samurai sword George Foreman Grill All of his
possessions dumped violently and unceremoniously in a pile
on his front lawn

Nick stands amongst his stuff He picks up the samurai
sword Looks at it Drops it back in the pile

He looks to the house dumbfounded but not overly surprised
He looks around the neighborhood It’s still early afternoon
and fairly empty Except for a large BLACK KID who stares at
him from across the street

He walks to the front door Tries the key It doesn’t work

He looks in the mailbox Empty

He looks for signs of life in the house None

He presses the intercom button

NICK
Hi Are you in there

He gets only static
NICK (CONTD)
If you are can this happen on
another day
He waits for a response Still just static
NICK (CONTD)

I‘1l just be out here if you want
to talk about this Okay

He walks back to his car and grabs another beer out of a
shopping bag Takes a big swig He pulls the garage door
opener from the visor He presses the button Nothing

Nick walks around to the side yard Tries the gate It’s
locked He grabs a trash can and rolls it up to the gate
He tries climbing on top

The can is empty and can’t hold his weight It tips

He falls spilling his beer and landing awkwardly on his
ankle Nick curses He limps to get another trash can this
one full He gingerly gets on top and reaches over the gate
unlatching it

CUT TO

EXT NICK’S BACKYARD - DAY

The backyard has a Japanese garden feel to it Stone
lanterns gravel paths and wind chimes Its most distinctive
feature three large above ground water tanks Speakers hangs
over each tank piping in Japanese classical Gagaku music

As Nick walks around the house we look inside the tanks
Each contain hundreds of small koi fish

Nick pays them no attention He looks under a potted plant
No spare key He tries a few windows They are all locked

He sees an envelope taped to the back screen door

CLOSE on the envelope It has the name “Nicholas” written
inside the shape of a fish

INT CROWN VICTORIA - DAY

Nick holds the envelope staring at it Nick opens another
beer He finally works up the nerve to open the letter

We see fragments of delicate cursive

INSERT - “lawyer called from Denver “No more” “Dont
call” “Catherine”

Nick puts the letter down Takes a drink and picks up his
phone Presses send It RINGS then goes to voicemail
Nick listens to the message We can just make out a woman’s
voice and a BEEP

NICK
Hi It’s Nick I’m gonna just try
and clean some of this stuff up and
get it out of here if that’s
alright with you When you’re
ready we can talk Oh I guess you
heard I lost my job today
soOkay Bye

Nick thinks for a moment before pressing end

EXT NICK’S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Nick gets out of the car

He grabs a pile of clothes and carries it to his car He
opens the trunk It’s occupied with his file boxes from work

CUT TO

EXT NICK’S SIDEYARD - DAY

Nick carries the file boxes he brought home from work He
empties the boxes including his awards and office paperwork
into a trash can

BACK TO - THE FRONT YARD

Nick grabs the clothes He stuffs them in the file boxes and
puts them in the trunk

The trunk fills quickly Nick sweats profusely
He rests for a moment and finishes a beer
He shoves his golf clubs in the car tearing the headliner
He tries putting a camping tent in and scratches the paint
He fills the backseat The pile on his lawn still looks as
big as it did before he started
INT NICK’S CAR - DAY
Nick back in the driver’s seat pulls on beer He swishes
it in his mouth He has an idea He dials his cell phone
puts it on speaker phone and rests it on the dash

REVEAL out the driver’s side window Nick’s neighbor ELLIOT
ALSTON standing next to his gleaming new F-250 Truck A sign
on the door reads Allston Landscaping Elliot is well
groomed with good posture He wears a green polo shirt with
his company’s logo a pair of pressed khakis a Bluetooth
headset and a disapproving look on his face

Nick rolls down his window

NICK
Hi Elliot You’re home early

ELLIOT
Benefit of being the boss I guess
(pointing to the lawn)
You know having all that stuff on
your lawn is going to destroy the
root system

NICK
Sorry about the mess I’11 have it
out of here by tomorrow

Nick looks at Elliot knowing he is enjoying it

ELLIOT
Nick you know me I try to keep
out of these things but if I’m

mile away

ELLIOT

but I can’t

NICK

ELLIOT

NICK

Kitty’s wishes
Nick starts to walk away Turns around
NICK (CONTD)

There is an awkward pause

ELLIOT (CONTD)
Sorry Nick

Nick walks back to his car
ELLIOT (CONTD)
(after him)
Youve got some brown patches over
there you should look into

Nick gets in the car and shuts the door

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - LATER - DUSK

Nick starts looking through his belongings Organizing them
for packing He puts some of his albums back into their old
milk crates He throws his old books into a pile He puts
his sports memorabilia on top of his poker table

As he goes through his things you get the feeling that he
hasn’t seen some of these things in a long time

He takes his Lazy Boy and rights it

Nick sits and drinks as he watches the worker bees return to
the neighborhood A couple of people stare at him as they get
out of their cars Nick smiles and tips his beer to them
Though his pain is deep he is feeling very little of it now

Across the street a NURSE wheels an OLDER MAN in a
wheelchair out of the house to take the evening air He wears
an old military jacket The nurse smiles politely at Nick
The man in the wheelchair just stares at him

Their moment is interrupted by a car driving up the street

A Volvo Wagon with requisite peacenik bumper stickers towing
a Ryder trailer It pulls up to the house directly across
from Nick’s which has a for sale sign out front covered with
a “Sold” sticker The driver backs up and goes forward
repeatedly until the car and trailer are perfectly straight

A YOUNG WOMAN 20’s gets out She stretches her back and
rubs her stomach which is just beginning to show her
pregnancy She surveys the house The neighborhood She
looks across the street and notices Nick’s yard She smiles
nervously and waves at him

She goes to her front door steels herself and enters her new
house for the first time

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - LATER - EVENING

Nick is still on the Lazy Boy but it is fully reclined He
is engaged in a common after work ritual Getting drunk
Except now he is on the lawn And instead of TV he watches
the young woman as she walks around her new house checking
for dust opening windows and switching lights on and off

Nick’s eyes flutter and then close It has been a long day

FADE OUT

EXT PAINTED DESERT - DAWN

A rock climber silhouetted by the rising sun scales a vertical
butte He is free climbing a difficult piece of the rock

Titles SUPERIMPOSE over the tableau

ACHIEVEMENT
The moment you commit yourself is the moment your goal is assured

The sound of SPRINKLERS slowly fades up over the peaceful
moment

FADE OUT

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - MORNING

We still hear sprinklers as we reveal Nick passed out on his
Lazy Boy mouth agape

A stream of water slashes across frame soaking Nick’s shirt
as it passes He does not stir

We stay on Nick listening to the CHUK-CHUK-CHUK of the
sprinklers

UNTIL - The water stream comes back and hits him right in the
mouth Gagging him Nick struggles to get up He has no
idea where he is Finally it comes to him

All of his possessions are getting soaked

Nick runs over to one of the sprinklers He tries to stop
the water with his hand but that just widens the spray He
throws a shirt over the head but by the time he reaches the
next one the shirt has flown off Finally he scrambles to
move everything out of the water’s reach

As he pulls his possessions to the safety of the driveway he
slips on the wet grass staining his clothes green and brown

He gets everything clear He leans against his car for a
moment He is dirty and wet but he has saved his stuff

The sprinklers stop

CUT TO
Nick grabs some dry clothes from the bottom of a pile
He gets in the car and changes He looks in the mirror He
is still wet a combination of water and sweat His body
needs alcohol He takes the flask out of his glove
compartment Empty

Nick goes through his beer can collection They’re all empty

Nick looks in his rear view mirror and sees the young woman
across the street unpacking the Ryder trailer

EXT - YOUNG WOMAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

Nick lumbers across the street The young woman is lifting a
box out of the back of the trailer

NICK
Nice bumper stickers

Samantha turns around to see Nick not sure if he is serious
We get a good look at the stickers One is anti-Bush one is
pro-choice and one is anti-gun

SAMANTHA
I probably should have taken them
off before I hit Arkansas

NICK
Don’t bother just get a gun like
the rest of us

They smile The ice broken He extends his hand

NICK (CONT’D)

imposition I was wondering if I

SAMANTHA

NICK

on my stuff over there while you

Nick looks over at his yard He notices the extremely large
black kid from yesterday The kid rides a very small bike
and circles the items Nick has left on the driveway to dry

SAMANTHA

NICK

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Nick walks over to his driveway watching the kid circle

We get a good look at him He is about 13 but huge for his
age He looks like a circus bear riding a mini motor cycle

NICK

Nick notices Ron is wearing a Texas Rangers hat He goes
over to a small plastic chest on the lawn He opens it and

baseball cards and walks over to Ron

NICK
How about a 1989 Nolan Ryan baseball

headset and talks on his cellphone He walks over to Nick’s
house passes right by him and puts the mail in the box as
if Nick didn’t even exist

Nick is depressed He looks around thoughtfully at his
stuff At the neighborhood People go about their business

He reaches for a small table lying on its side next to the
Lazy Boy He rights it Puts the mail and his beer on it

He has a side table He looks at some other stuff

sheathing his nightstick

COP

NICK
Hi

COP

NICK

organized Is there a problem

COP
We got some complaints about
someone living on their lawn

NICK
Really Who complained

Nick looks over at Elliot’s house A curtain quickly closes

COP
That’s confidential sir

NICK
Well This is my lawn And this
is my house And I believe the law
says I can do whatever I want to on
my property

The cop looks at the pile of empty beers on the lawn

COP
How much have you had to drink

NICK
Not enough

COP
You know there’s a law against
having open containers in public

NICK
In Texas There is a law in Texas
that says I can’t drink a fucking
beer on my front lawn

COP
(tensing up a bit)
I think you should come with me sir

NICK
(resolute)
I can’t leave my stuff

The cop talks into his shoulder mike He approaches Nick in
take down mode

COP

surveying the scene particularly the empty beers

NICK

FRANK
I think it might be worth giving
her some time on this one
(looking around)
(MORE)

FRANK (CONTD)
So this is your plan to cool
things down Sit in the yard and
get drunk

NICK
They say that the dining room is
the least utilized part of the
house I think it’s the front
lawn

Frank stands up

NICK (CONTD)
We put all this energy into it
Mowing Watering Fertilizing
Why To impress people as they
drive by To make our neighbors
jealous Show them how successful
we are But do we ever actually
use it

FRANK
The minute you even thought about
taking a drink you should have
called me

NICK
I got fired from the only job I
ever had I was accused of
assaulting a coworker and my wife
leaves me Somehow calling you
slipped my mind

Nick goes back to his Lazyboy

FRANK
You can’t do this Nick

NICK
I’m just going to get things
organized It’s starting to look
good don’t you think

FRANK
You can’t stay here It’s illegal

NICK

Frank puts his hand out Nick doesn’t budge

FRANK (CONT’D)

Nick thinks of something He gets up and starts rummaging
through his boxes

FRANK (CONTD)
What are you doing

He gives Frank the “wait there” hand signal Nick finds what
he is looking for A small book He finds a page and hands
it to Frank

FRANK (CONTD)
What’s this

He goes into the cooler and pulls out a beer He sits in the
Lazy Boy He gestures for Frank to sit on the coffee table

NICK
Just read it The highlighted part

Frank gives him a look

NICK (CONT’D)
Come on

Frank sits and begins to read

FRANK
When the defeat of your enemy is
imminent be sure to leave those who
flee the battlefield a way out Do
not corner the remaining
opposition For when they know
they are trapped and death is
imminent each soldier will fight
back with the strength of a hundred
men
NICK
I give my sales trainees this book
This guy Sun Tzu was a master
general

FRANK
I know who he is Nick We read him
in the academy

NICK
We have these workshops I have
everyone choose one of the sayings
and apply it to their job I
always choose “peace is only a time
to be used to prepare for war” It
sounds tough and I figure it’s good
for my image But the one you just
read that’s always been one of my
favorites

FRANK
What’s your point

He looks around at his stuff His face turns
NICK
This is my corner - I’m not leaving
my stuff
He takes a pull off his beer

Frank looks at Nick He puts the book on the
they are done

FRANK
I‘1l call dispatch and make sure no
one comes by tonight Slow down on
the beer and get some rest We’1l1

FRANK
How long do you think it might take
to pull your shit together

NICK
Are you going to make me leave

Frank looks at Nick for a moment Shakes his head He takes
a piece of paper out of the plastic bag Gives it to Nick

FRANK
City of Plano has an ordinance
stating a property owner can hold a
yard sale for no more than five
consecutive days and no more than
ten days in any one year

NICK
I don’t want to sell my stuff

As Nick reads Frank empties out the bag onto the table

FRANK (CONT’D)

paper Make some signs and you can
stay for three more days

NICK
I need to make signs

Frank is disgusted He walks away Nick gets up

NICK (CONTD)
It was a joke

FRANK

(losing his temper)
Weve been through this too many
goddamn times I’m not gonna tell
you what to do since we both know
that doesn’t work If it takes you
sitting out here and making an
idiot of yourself to get cleaned
up then so be it Sell your shit

to see if anyone is watching

EXT NICK’S BACKYARD - LATE AT NIGHT

Nick’s wet pants and boxers are thrown to the ground He
stands at the koi tank and starts to pee into it fresh pants
slung over his shoulder ass hanging in the wind as Japanese

music plays quietly on the speakers above him

CLOSE on Nick’s face as he hums to the music He is
interrupted by the sound of distant groaning

He finishes up and heads to investigate

EXT NICK’S SIDEYARD - LATE AT NIGHT

He parts the bushes separating his house from Elliot’s He’s
getting warmer The groaning is louder more animated

EXT ELLIOT AND KITTY’S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

Nick sneaks over to the side of the house There is a
basement windowlightwell halfway below ground level A

pulsating light emanates from within

Nick kneels down and looks through the window The groans
are louder and more distinct A mix of pain and pleasure

CLOSE on Nick’s eyes He looks instantly sober

NICK’S POV OF THE ALSTON BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Kitty is wearing a dominatrix outfit She is also wearing a
strap on Elliot is bent over and Kitty is fucking him in
the ass hard A strobe light illuminates the ugly tableau
as Elliot writhes in ecstasy

CUT TO

EXT ELLIOT AND KITTY’S SIDEYARD - MORNING

CLOSE ON an OUTDOOR ELECTRICAL SOCKET

An orange extension cord is plugged into it Music plays in
the background The camera moves away from the socket
following the cord away from the Allston’s Across the
bushes Across Nick’s driveway Onto his lawn To a power
strip All the sockets are occupied

The camera moves to Nick’s baseball clock Plugged in and
flashing 1200

To Nick’s Ron Popeil Rotisserie A burrito spins heating to
perfection

To Nick’s stereo It is completely set up One of his dad’s
records spins on the turntable

The camera moves again to a humming mini refrigerator The
door opens The fridge is filled with beer A hand reaches
in and grabs an icy cold one

WIDEN to reveal Nick cracking the beer A smile on his face
as he enjoys the music and the morning sun Things are
shaping up He looks over to Kitty and Elliot who stand
inside their garage He raises his beer to them

Kenny and Nick work on organizing Nick’s lawn Things are
starting to find their right place It looks less like a
yard sale and more like a re-creation of Nick’s living room
His albums are near his stereo His food sits on his fridge

Nick looks across the street The nurse is trying to get the
old man and his wheelchair up the steps to the porch With
no ramp it’s hard work He watches her struggle for a bit
He has an idea

EXT SPECIALIST SEARS HOUSE - LATER

CLOSE on a wheel going up a ramp

WIDER to reveal Nick holding a beer and trying to help the
Nurse maneuver the wheelchair up the ramp which Nick has

fashioned from an upside down pair of old water skis

NURSE
I can’t thank you enough

NICK
Keep them Please

NURSE
I’m just about to give him his
lunch Why don’t you join him

Nick looks over at Kenny Sees that he’s doing fine alone

NICK
Sure

Nick sits down next to the old man who stares straight ahead
at Nick’s house

The Nurse comes out She has two trays with pea soup and
grilled cheese on them

NURSE
He fought all over Europe and the
Pacific Very decorated He lost his
voice on one of the islands Shot
right through the throat

The old man moves his hands on his lap and opens his palms as
if reading a book

NICK
What’s he doing

NURSE
He wants to show you his scrapbook
Do you mind

NICK
No

She walks inside Nick and the old man chew on their
sandwiches looking out at Nick’s lawn The nurse returns

NURSE
It ain’t exactly what I would call
lunch time reading

She hands him the thick album Nick puts his food down and
opens it

The first page has a series of medals attached to it

NICK
Specialist Sears
(putting a name to the face)
These are all yours

Specialist Sears looks straight ahead

Nick looks through the book There are postcards from
Europe Letters of Commendation Letters to his wife
Pictures of young soldiers mugging to the camera

Nick stops at the last page It contains a series of old
photos One shows a sword wielding Japanese soldier about to
behead a prisoner

Another shows an image of dead Japanese soldiers stacked
like logs Specialist Sears and his buddies stand on top of
the bodies rifles across their chests The final image is
of a smiling young Specialist Sears kneeling behind a dead
Nazi He holds the dead man’s head proudly in the air as if
displaying a trophy buck

Nick closes the book and takes a long pull on his beer

NICK (CONT’D)
Specialist Sears You are one sick fuck

Nick looks over at the old soldier Specialist Sears’ mouth
turns up into the slightest of grins Nick closes the book
and looks back at his house

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - LATER

Nick sits in his Lazy Boy drinking a beer staring across the
street at Specialist Sear He has headphones on and listens
to a record Kenny comes up to Nick

He points to a guy looking at Nick’s Ron Popeil Rotisserie

Nick knows Kenny is not happy

NICK
Youve been busting ass and I want you
to know I appreciate it You know

We’re too corporate We need less
“me” and more “we”

Kenny has no idea what he is talking about

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - LATER

Nick looks through his stuff He is wearing a Yankees jersey
emblazoned with the name Munson He finds a Yankee batting
helmet A Texas Rangers sticker covers the NY He brings
the helmet to Kenny who wears a University of Texas jersey
which reads Porter across the back The jersey is three
sizes too small Nick tries putting the helmet on Kenny’s
huge skull but it doesn’t come close

Nick goes back to his stuff and starts looking again

NICK
You sure you don’t want to play
football

He finds a cycling helmet

KENNY
My mom won’t let me

He puts it on Kenny It kind of fits

NICK
You’re a born left tackle Kenny Second

NICK (CONTD)
Okay Front shoulder and chin
tucked in Hands back Weight on
the balls of your feet Don’t
swing at bad pitches

KENNY
Where’s the umpire

NICK
We don’t need one

KENNY
How do I know if it’s a bad pitch
without an umpire

Kenny doesn’t move Nick is frustrated He sees something
across the street

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - LATER

Nick wheels the old veteran from across the street onto the
lawn He places him right behind Kenny

NICK
Now you just try and hit it to me

He looks at Specialist Sears He goes and grabs a big pillow
and places it in front of Specialist Sears’ chest He pats
him on the back and walks about thirty feet away

NICK (CONT’D)
I just want to see your form

Nick holds a yellow softball He goes into an exaggerated
pitcher stance Looks at imaginary signs Kenny smiles
Nick smiles and winds up He pitches Kenny doesn’t move
The ball hits Specialist Sear’s pillow

NICK (CONTD)
That’s good All good hitters wait
for the right pitch

Nick grabs the ball and runs back to the mound
NICK (CONTD)
Okay Give it a swing this time
Don’t worry about the pitch
Nick gets in position Kenny just stands there Nick goes
over and puts Kenny in a more athletic position He goes
back to his “mound” He pitches

Kenny swings His girth makes him about three seconds late

NICK (CONTD)
That’s good Kenny Real good

Nick notices Samantha is watching them
NICK (CONTD)

(to Kenny)
Hold on

He goes over to one of his boxes and grabs something He
runs over to Sam’s house

NICK (CONTD)

camera)

She opens it expertly and points it at Nick Checks the

spits out

SAMANTHA (CONTD)

Samantha smiles at him

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - LATER
VARIOUS SHOTS

Nick stands at the plate Kenny pitches Nick bunts and
runs to first Sam walkruns after him and tags him out

Nick pitches to Sam She gives it a little swing and waddles
towards first

Nick stands behind Kenny and helps him connect with Sam’s
pitch He ushers Kenny to run to first Kenny and all of
his girth run in slow motion

Kenny smiles having reached first base

Nick stands at the plate He points his bat a la Babe Ruth
Kenny goes into an exaggerated wind up and pitches to Nick

Nick rips the pitch high and deep His form is impressive

Everyone watches as the ball sails through the air and then

disappears from sight only to be replaced with the wail of a
car alarm The moment shattered

Nick Kenny and Sam look at each other They instinctively
do what every person who has hit a car with a ball does
They run leaving Specialist Sears alone on the lawn

EXT MISS COOPER’S BACKYARD - LATER

Nick sits in a floating pool chair drinking a beer Kenny
sits with his feet in the water reading a book titled “The
Sales Bible” Next to him are a few more sales books

NICK
How’s Miss Cooper doing

KENNY
My mom says she’s gonna die soon
But she isn’t suffering
(looking at his book)
What’s it mean Make it easy to buy

NICK
Well it can mean lots of things

Displaying things in a way that’s
appealing to people Explaining how
products work so there’s no confusion
You’re actually interested in this

walks she is clearly on something She sees Nick on the
front lawn and becomes confused

NICK
I don’t think they wanted kids

The girl gets up shakily and goes to her car Nick doesn’t
notice

NICK (CONTD)
I started drinking again and I
told her I wasn’t going to bring
another kid into this world with
two drunks for parents So she
started drinking again

NICK (CONTD)
And then she stopped and we never
talked about it again She just
started with the fish I should
give her a kid What do you think

Nick looks over and sees her Fiero tearing away Nick is
alone He looks around at his stuff and notices something

CLOSE on a Super 8 Projector

A shaky hand plugs it into the powerstrip

Nick switches it on The bulb lights up and the reel works
CLOSE on a small tin box of Super 8 reels They are labeled
with old masking tape Some have dates like “Summer 65”
others say “Wedding” etc

Nick reaches in and pulls a reel out that says “B-day 69
His shaky hand threads it on the projector He turns it on

WIDER - Nick projects the film onto the side of his house

Scratches light leaks and jump cuts blend into a grainy
Kodachrome moving picture

A young Nick holds a little baseball bat He wears a cowboy
hat and a little Texas Rangers jersey He swings in slow
motion and cheers as an imaginary ball goes over the fence

The older Nick smiles at this image of himself
The picture blows out

We see a woman NICKS MOTHER holding a drink She stands in
front of a Dodge Dart a small well kept house behind them
Nick wears a birthday hat Nick and his mom wave to camera

Nick’s mom beckons to the person behind the camera Nothing
happens Finally she comes to the camera and grabs it

The film goes black and then reappears Nick is still at the
car but is joined by his FATHER a Texas bohemian who stands
at the opposite edge of the car holding a can of Schlitz and
a cigarette He does not interact with his son at all

Long distance whatever

Nick stops reading the yearbook

NICK
Elliot your business is your

Elliot exhales

ELLIOT
Nick if you ever want to join me

Thursday night at the church We
get some pizzas and sodas It’s
just a bunch of guys talking Some
people find it very helpful

NICK
I appreciate the offer Elliot

ELLIOT
Sure Oh I forgot to tell you
Those brown patches on your lawn
it’s not dogs Your lawn is sick
It’s a disease called St Augustine
Decline If you don’t fix it the
whole thing will die But you’re
lucky it’s still early

NICK
(staring at his lawn)
Is there a cure

ELLIOT

Well you can’t spray because it
actually lives inside the blade
You can fertilize but that only
delays the inevitable Only thing
you can do is put new plugs in
Pretty soon the new stuff crowds
out the old stuff Good as new

NICK
Thanks Elliot

Elliot gives him a little wave and gets in his truck Nick
goes back to his yearbook He looks at the notes

INSERT - A note reads “Dude you rock So psyched to get out

Samantha and Nick separate She reaches into her pocket and
pulls something out She hands it to Nick gives him a kiss
on the cheek and runs back to her house

Nick watches her go He looks down at the thing she gave him

It’s the Polaroid she took of him Underneath she has pasted
her fortune from Chang’s Nick looks at it

CLOSE on the fortune It reads “Everything is not yet lost”
Nick looks over at Sam’s house and smiles

FADE OUT

A 1970S TEST ROCKET STANDS AT THE READY ON THE LAUNCH PAD
Ignition It soars into the sky higher and higher

Titles SUPERIMPOSE
FAILURE
Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently

As the rocket makes an unintended left turn and starts
spinning and spinning until it hits the ground and explodes

FADE OUT

OVER BLACK - THE SOUND OF SPRINKLERS

FADE IN

EXT NICK’S HOUSE - DAWN

CLOSE on a sprinkler as it spits water

CLOSE on the Koi Autofeeder as it releases its pellets
CLOSE on the Koi sucking their food down

CLOSE on the front window of Nick’s house still broken but
there is a board over it

CLOSE on three recycling bins They are overflowing with
bottles and cans A trash truck pulls up A garbage man
gets off and starts filling the truck

The trash truck pulls away revealing Nick’s lawn There is
nothing on it Just grass

A taxi pulls up in the foreground blocking our view

EXT NICK’S STREET - DAWN

CLOSE on loafer clad feet The feet pause halfway up the
lawn in front of a box of old albums Nick’s albums

Samantha stands at the front door Smiling The loafer’s
owner her husband comes up to her They kiss and hug

CLOSE on Samantha’s face as she smiles

She looks at Nick’s stereo and album collection on her lawn
Her smile fades slightly as she looks at Nick’s empty lawn
EXT ELLIOT AND KITTY’S HOUSE - DAWN

Elliot comes out in his robe Holding his coffee He
notices a basket on the porch He bends down and pulls
something out of it It is one of Nick’s vintage Playboys
Elliot looks around the neighborhood He smiles

EXT KENNY’S HOUSE - DAWN

Kenny comes outside There is a small box sitting on his
stoop The same box in which Nick received his Swiss Army
knife He picks it up Examines it

He opens the box

He takes out the autographed Yankee baseball He smiles

moment He opens his gym bag and pulls out his yearbook

table and sits down He opens the yearbook As he searches
through it
