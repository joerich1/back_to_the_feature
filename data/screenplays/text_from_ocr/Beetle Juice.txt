SCENE NUMBERS WHICH HAVENT BEEN RETAINED FOR THIS FILE
FADE IN
EXT WINTER RIVER CONNECTICUT - DAY

A crisp and perfect New England town Almost too neat to
be real No visible townspeople CAMERA EXPLORES town

CAMERA FLIES OVER a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland
Hardware and Appliance Store -- PAST the church -- the

Historical Society -- UP OVER the graveyard on the hill
and finally --

TO the Maitland house The perfect Victorian house surveying
the perfect village Suddenly --

A giant daddy longlegs spider -- mounts the crest of
hill beside the house pauses to wave a spindly leg and
then creeps menacingly on top of the Maitland house

ADAM (0S)
Well well youre a big fella

A hand -- as big as Gods -- with a huge tweezer gently
reaches down out of the sky and lies palm up in the
yard next to the house Daddy longlegs climbs into it
The hand raises into the sky again

INT ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

Reveals Winter River as a miniature town while the daddy
longlegs and the hand are normal size Above the model
are a homely representation of moon sun and stars -- a
whole tiny mechanical universe to track the hours of the
day A large plat map of the city is prominent on the
wall

The hand is ADAM MAITLANDs In his late 30s hes a
solid easy-going citizen Capra used to make movies
about him

Adams model town sprawls across most of the attic space
Windows on either end of the attic shed good light into
the warm room Adam very carefully lifts the spider out
the open window Smiles as he drops him lightly on the
breeze

CAMERA TILTS UP FROM the window to see -- the real Winter
River laid out exactly as the model at the foot of the

hill Adam breathes deeply and looks very pleased at the
glorious town below him

ON his huge hand again -- as it reaches into model and
tweezes a tiny sign into the tiny window of Maitlands
Hardware Store on Main Street It reads

ADAM AND BARBARA MATTLAND
ARE
ON VACATION
HOORAY

Adam leans down and eyes the sign

BARBARA
(behind him)
Im ready

Adam turns to see entering BARBARA MAITLAND 35 -- a
wholesome beauty who is mellowing well She smiles at
him Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her be-
cause they dont have children

ADAM
(happy to see her)
Shes ready

BARBARA
(eyeing the model)
Oh Adam the model looks so good
The Historical Society will love
it Youve finished the streets

ADAM
(nodding)
Almost

She pushes a wrapped present across the table

BARBARA
Happy vacation honey

Adam smiles and gives her a present He opens his
present A can of furniture oil

ADAM
Manchurian Tung oil Where did

you get it

BARBARA
Helen got it for me in Oslo

ADAM
God Manchurian Tung oil
Theres enough to refinish the
gateleg table and the cherry
wardrobe

Barbara nods and unwraps her gift Rolls of very expensive
floral wallpaper She cradles it like gold leaf

BARBARA
Oh Adam Its Laura Ashley

He nods

ADAM
Enough to do the guest room

PHONE RINGS They freeze then grin

ADAM and BARBARA
(unison)
No ones home

BARBARA
Oh I love it I can get the
guest room done

ADAM

Yeah I want to get one coat on
the wardrobe and then Ill help
you

BARBARA
Oh honey Im so glad were

ADAM
(hugging her)
God how I have looked forward
to this honey

HONK HONK outside They look at each other horrified
Peer out the window

BARBARA
Oh no

ADAM
(pointing at her)
Its your turn darling

She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs
KNOCKING on door from below

INT KITCHEN - DAY
A comfortable slightly old-fashioned kitchen Barbara
enters with determination

HER POV

A woman -- JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall gawky and aggressive
peeks in the kitchen door Shes divorced three husbands
and buried another for good measure Shes ruthless but

is weirdly seamlessly pleasant She waves a legal-sized
paper at them starts to come inside

INTEXT KITCHEN DOOR

Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
a foot in Jane smiles wildly

JANE

BARBARA

fifty thousand dollars

BARBARA

JANE

BARBARA
And live in what our station
wagon
JANE
(frustrated)

Barbara Maitland sweetie you

too big It really ought to be
for a couple with a family

That hurts Barbara a little She looks at Jane

JANE
Oh honey I didnt mean anything
its just too big for you two
I know these things

BARBARA
(shutting door)
Bye Jane Ill see you in church
in a couple weeks

Jane compulsively affixes her business card face inside
in the windowpane Barbara pulls the shade down Shakes
her head and walks to the roll of wallpaper

BARBARA
(to herself)
Some people

INT MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam DOWN stairs -- PAST photos of himself
and Barbara old photos of the early days of Winter River
Pictures and momentoes of a satisfied life in hardware

We see the master bedroom sewing room guest rooms
bathrooms the rambling old-fashioned quality to the
house Clean sentimental warm and floral Some rooms
in progress

Adam is humming happily looking for paintbrushes in the
ground-floor storeroom He spies a CASSETTE DECK and
looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one It is
an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG

INT GUEST ROOM - DAY

Barbara is starting to paper the walls already She
frowns at the MUSIC Goes to the door

BARBARA
Oh honey You said no Ink Spots

on this vacation

It CLICKS OFF She goes back into the room

INT STOREROOM - DAY

Adam puts away the tape but keeps on humming the song
He needs more light

He opens the shutters on a small window He jumps back
frightened by Janes huge face grinning at him from
outside

JANE
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if
you carry a second lien
(desperate)
I can arrange the most creative
financing in the six states of
New England

ADAM
No Jane

JANE
Youll be rich

ADAM

(still trying
to be polite)
Were rich in what really matters

JANE
Adam my booyy When youre really
rich in what matters
(shaking the
contract)

in the Village And hes got a
little stress problem

(taps her head)

so his wife says they want

the old peace and quiet

ADAM
So do I Jane Im on vacation

JANE

in two weeks You dont have to
answer now He wants me to check
the deed restriction anyway You

He shakes his head She puts business card in the window
JANE
Come see me You know where to

Jane exits jauntily flapping her contract down the lawn
Squirrels scatter A bird dives at her She swings the

contract at it angrily

JANE
Get away you little monster

Jane phone in hand rushes to the window to watch
Maitlands drive by Almost popping the cord when it

EXT MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY
Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store
OLD BILL a slightly-addled ancient barber is napping
in a chair in front of his shop next door to Adams
Adam fumbles with the lock not interested in conversa-
tion He drops his keys waking Old Bill

OLD BILL
Morning Adam You need a
haircut before your vacation

ADAM
No thanks Bill

OLD BILL
Hows the model coming

ADAM
Good Bill -- Good

Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
Adam has entered Bill prattles throughout

OLD BILL

Yknow I was thinkin you

in 1835 but yknow his grandson
come in here last week and said
he found a bottle with an 1836
stamp in it plastered in the
foundation

(suddenly dis-

gusted at the

memory)
Hes got hair down to his
goddamned shoulders

INT MAITLAND HARDWARE

Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
picks up a small model of the Bozman building He
walks out Old Bill continues unabated

OLD BILL
He said Just give me a trim

(cut short by Mrs

Deetzs hang-up)

EXT CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

Car approaches

INT CAR - DAY

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam He cradles
small replica of the Bozman building complete with
brass lion

BARBARA
Adam your Bozman Building is a
beauty

ADAM

Yeah it turned out okay We
applied for a National Historical

plaque for it Thatll be the
third one on Main Street

BARBARA
Youre doing it Adam Youre
saving this town

ADAM
(grinning proudly)
Slow down there honey I dont
want the vibration to weaken the
model
BARBARA
(nervous)
Oh Im sorry

Barbara starts to apply the brakes

Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road
Stops to pee Barbara swerves As the car hits the
rickety bridge the speed is just a bit too much
BOARDS RATTLE and loosen the car skews and catches

in an open slot careens to the right then the left
and SMASHES through the side RAILS It hovers on the
edge of the bridge

INT CAR - DAY

A piling has smashed through the window on the passenger
side crushing the upper part of Barbaras arm She is
wailing in pain and fright

Adam attempts to maneuver the car onto the bridge again
Adam tries to help Barbara He tries to get out of the
car None of this succeeds

EXT BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

The dog finishes looks over at the car walks across
the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
car aloft

The car rocks back and forth for a moment and then
slides forward toward the water

EXT CAR AND BRIDGE

The car plunges into the rushing water It floats

for a moment and then sinks like a stone

UNDERWATER - DAY
The car floats downward with panic-stricken Adam and
Barbara inside For a moment we hear their SCREAMS then
as the car fills up with water the screams are cut off

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
INT BARBARA AND ADAMS LIVING ROOM - DAY

Quiet still expectant There is a fire laid in the
hearth Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
and burns with a furious cheerfulness

Barbara and Adam enter dazed wet and bedraggled

BARBARA
Something like this always
happens when we try to go on
vacation Always

Adam leads her toward the fire

ADAM
Youll feel better when youre
dry

He holds out his hands to be warmed Barbara comes up
beside him All this time shes been holding her injured
arm with the other hand

BARBARA
This fire wasnt burning when
we left the house

ADAM
Hows your arm

BARBARA
Im not sure It feels frozen

She holds her arms out to warm them One hand catches on
fire

BARBARAS LEFT ARM

They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
senses and snatches it out of the fire Two of the

fingers are burning like candles and Barbara industriously
blows them out

BARBARA
Oh Adam

CUT TO
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)

They are sitting on the couch together Barbara is looking
away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is drawing
blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers He frowns

He looks at his skin It is pale He looks at Barbara

ADAM
Youd better sit down hon

BARBARA
I am sitting

ADAM
Ill tell you what Barbara IT
dont think we survived that crash

BARBARA
(pause)
Oh Adam Were home In our own
house Nonsense Ill make some
coffee You get some more
firewood

Adam gets up a little absently she follows him as he
wanders to the front door He peers out

ADAM
Lets take things extra slow Do
you remember how we got back up
here

Barbara tests her hand clenches and unclenches her fist

BARBARA
Im fine My arm works fine

Adam exploring opens the door steps out on the front
porch

EXT FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

Adams face is painted with color of sunset He stands
atop the steps leading down to the front yard Barbara
stands just inside the open threshold looking out
worriedly

BARBARA
(quiet sarcasm)

The end of a perfect day

Adam starts to step down to the yard
ADAM
Honey Im gonna go down to the
bridge and retrace our steps

He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
disappears

BARBARA
Adam

EXT GREAT VOID

Adam is nowhere Theres no ground no sky nothing to
stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance
Just vast nothing Not white and not colored either
Noise of a CLOCK TICKING

Adam looks about surprised doesnt like what he doesnt
see He turns around to head back up the steps There

are no steps

ADAM
Barbara

His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY He runs off a little in the
distance and calls again from over there

ADAM
(quietly)

Where are you

He goes even farther away

FOREGROUND - ENORMOUS GEARED WHEEL

-- The size of a man -- rolls by tearing up the unseamed
ground Something pours up out of the tear -- ooze or
stuffing

Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel which is
now out of sight

TWO SMALLER GEARS

looking very much like components of a giant watch --
spin along behind him One of them veers suddenly
toward him and though Adam jumps out of the way the
gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it LOUD TICKING
A perfectly enormous gear comes barreling toward him
Adam leaps out of its way The gear turns fish-tailing
kicking up ooze and stuffing

Adam flings himself suddenly to the right but trips into
the path of the gear As hes about to be crushed hes
suddenly jerked up to safety

EXT FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Its Barbara whos grabbed him and quite evidently saved
his -- not life perhaps -- but existence Hes shaken
breathless

Barbara stares at him as if wondering what hes just
been through

ADAM
(weakly)

You saved my -- uh -- life or
whatever something

BARBARA
Two hours

ADAM
What

BARBARA

Thats how long you were gone

ADAM
(pondering that)
Hmmm

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Barbara leads Adam into the house

ADAM
Anything happen while I was away

BARBARA
Yes it did Yes it did I made a
couple of small discoveries
Heres one

She stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle On the
mantle is Barbaras prize collection of porcelain horses
Adam comes to stand beside her They look into the
mirror and there is no reflection of them

Barbara picks up one of the horses and trots it through
the air The horse is imaged in the mirror

BARBARA
Theres that and theres this

She picks up an ancient leather-bound book Its yellow
and worn about the size of the Boy Scout manual

CLOSEUP - BOOK

Its title is Handbook For The Recently Deceased

BACK TO SCENE

ADAM
(reading)
Handbook for the recently diseased

BARBARA
Deceased I dont know where it
came from

ADAM
Look at the publisher
(as he does)
Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Press

They look at each other as it sinks in to Barbara

BARBARA
(finally admitting it)
I dont think we survived the crash

ADAM
This is going to take some time

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Adam is already in bed reading from the handbook

Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of their
married lives

BARBARA
I dont like situations like this
I hate it when Im not in control
So just tell me the basics

ADAM
This book isnt arranged that way
What do you want to know

BARBARA
There are a thousand things Why
did you disappear when you walked
off the front porch Is this a
punishment Are we halfway to
heaven or are we halfway to hell
And how long is this going to
last
ADAM

I dont see anything about Rewards
and Punishments or Heaven and
Hell

(frustrated)
This book reads like stereo
instructions Listen to this
Geographical and Temporal
Perimeters Functional perimeters
vary from manifestation to
manifestation This is going to
take some time

Barbara paces she trips on her wallpaper rolls Kicks
them

BARBARA
I knew Id never finish the guest
room Adam we just cant stay in
here forever

They look at each other the question hangs in the air
Cant they

Adam stands and walks to the window
ADAM
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should set up a normal

routine

She looks at him like hes nuts

ADAM
I mean lets try to nail down
something in our lives A regular

schedule We can keep track of
time and go on with our projects
up here in the attic
She shakes her head exasperated Flops down on the bed
BARBARA
Oh God maybe this is all just a
bad dream
TIGHT ON ADAM

A somber look comes across his face

ADAM
Im afraid not honey

Barbara looks up at him questioningly
BARBARA
Why Whats wrong Adam

She stands and joins him at the window

THEIR POV THROUGH WINDOW

In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
threading its way toward the nearby cemetery Headlights
are on We recognize Janes car in the line

REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

Sober faces

TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

It arrives at the gravesite We see some familiar faces
Ernie and Old Bill the Barber Jane and Little Jane
watch as two identical coffins are carried together to
two open graves

ON BARBARA AND ADAM

She drops her head sadly on his shoulder He leans his
face slightly into hers

FADE OUT

FADE IN
INT ATTIC - DAY

Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
cemetery It reads ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND UNITED
IN LIFE UNDIVIDED IN DEATH

ADAM
I wish I could see the cemetery
from up here I dont know which
area is the best placement for us

Barbara trying to clean lets out a frustrated yelp
She paces

ADAM
Cabin fever hon

BARBARA
I cant clean anything The vacuum

Barbara shakes her head and picks up the handbook

tell us something Where are all
the other dead people in the
world Why is it just you and me

ADAM
Maybe this is heaven

BARBARA
(looking at the dusty
walls)
In heaven there wouldnt be dust
on the wallpaper

ADAM
Hon I didnt want to die but

long as I never have to wash
dishes again

BARBARA

Adam and Barbara look at one

BARBARA
She cant see you right
(as Adam nods)
In the book Rule Number Two
the living usually wont see the
dead

ADAM
Wont Or cant

BARBARA
Just says wont Wait a minute
Here it says the living are
arrogant they think theyll
never die so they refuse to see
the dead

ADAM
Arrogant Thats Jane Butterfield

BARBARA

(sighs and nods)
At least we wont have to worry

her on the head smiles and goes to his model

ADAM
Keep studying the book Breathe

EXT MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane drives away CAMERA HINGES to see a For Sale sign
Across it -- another smaller banner It reads

SOLD

CUT TO

INT MASTER BEDROOM —- MORNING

The Maitlands are asleep CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
bit It is getting slightly tatty Adam rolls over
pulling the covers off Barbara We see

ON BARBARA

She is hovering off the side of the bed

An OMINOUS RUMBLE --

-- like a 40 earthquake shakes the house GLASS
RATTLES the ceramic horses on the mantlepiece jump
around Barbara falls to the floor They look at one
another with horror They leap up and run downstairs
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

The RUMBLE BUILDS to a climax there is a LOUD METALLIC
SQUEAL and then a CRASH just as Barbara and Adam
arrive

MOVING VAN RAMP

SMASHES open the front DOOR and CRASHES down into the
foyer

TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

slides smoothly down the ramp On the couch sits DELIA
DEETZ

Delia is relentlessly New York relentlessly fashionable
relentlessly thin -- a totally self-assured Joan Rivers

DELIA
Get it right you people And I
dont pay overtime

She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara and
Adams house and remake it in her own very upscale image

Delias gaze is on the living room but she looks through
Adam and Barbara as if they werent even there (which to
her eyes theyre not)

The COUCH CRASHES into the base of the staircase SMASHING
the NEWELL POST and several of the BALUSTERS

Barbara cringes One of the balusters falls at Delias
side She grasps it like a scepter

Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp

MOVING MAN 1
Sorry about that Mrs Deetz

DELIA
Dont worry It was going anyway

Staggered by Delias grand entrance Barbara looks toward
Adam but he has disappeared

Flustered Barbara glances around the room shakes herself
experimentally then with a look of surprise on her
face that it works -- disappears herself

Still holding the baluster Delia gets up off the couch
and moves into the living room surveying it with an
odd mixture of ambition contempt and resolution

Behind her the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue
leather armchair In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ

Lydia age 14 is a pretty girl but wan pale and
overly-dramatic dressed as she is in her favorite color
black leather Shes a combination of a little death
rocker and an 80s version of Edward Goreys little
girls

She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
and is already taking photographs of the Moving Men
Lydia is cool Lydia is sullen Lydia is her fathers
daughter by his first marriage Lydia is usually about
half-pissed off But underneath we like her a lot

The Moving Men still hold up the chair waiting for Delia
to decide where she wants it

DELIA

Jesus Who lived here The
Waltons

TIGHT ON LYDIA
Calmly surveys the house

LYDIA
You hate it I love it

Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
chair down anywhere

DELIA
Get all this other crap out of
here

Lydia hops down out of the chair and comes farther into
the living room

DELIA
Where is your father Probably
in the kitchen

Thats the cue for CHARLES DEETZ who comes in through
the swinging door and across the dining room

Hes holding a butcher knife in one hand and a massive
meat cleaver in the other

Charles is not exactly the equivalent of his wife being
at heart a basically pleasant man But pleasant isnt
in this year so Charles does his best to be offhanded
and brittle

CHARLES
The noise in that kitchen Noisy
refrigerator noisy faucets
Well have to replace it all I
want no humming in the house

Lydia exploring on her own gazes around the living room
with growing pleasure she backs up for a good angle to
photograph

CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature
LYDIA
(to herself)

A real house

Barbara looks closely at Lydias hair and thinks
Yecchh Charles enters

CHARLES
What do you think honey

LYDIA
Delia hates it
Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs

LYDIA
I could live here

A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream It is
Delia Not Barbara

DELIA
Settle down Lydia I wonder
where we are going to get
counseling for you out here

A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz familys
attention to the front windows

OTHO (OS)
Help Oh help

Wedged in the window frame is a massive body

The short stubby legs dressed in the worlds largest
pair of Georgia Armani slacks protrude into the living
room waving frantically Expensive Italian loafers
are kicked off the feet revealing a pair of expensive
patterned socks By their feet shall ye know them

DELIA
Its Otho

CHARLES
Otho why didnt you just come in
the door

Othos voice comes as if from a great distance

OTHO (OS)
Its bad luck And I believe
hugely in luck

LYDIA
Hold your breath and well pull

The entire Deetz family at last pulls Otho into the
living room

All this while the Moving Men are variously carting
out the handsome old furniture and bringing in the
hideous new furniture

Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
faggoty But hes not all fat and fun -- this customer
carries nasty emotional weight as well

As Otho is pulled through the window he is holding onto
the curtains for support And when he is at last all
the way through and upright on his feet he suddenly
gives a tremendous yank The whole drapery apparatus
including valences crashes to the floor

OTHO
That was the single most
unattractive window treatment I
have ever seen in the entire of
my existence

DELIA
(starry eyed)
Im so glad you could leave the
city to consult me Otho

Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
horror

OTHO
Yes of course you are Well
Otho had an intuition Call ita
hunch -- that it was going to be a
fabled monstrosity of a house And
it certainly is Charles youre
lucky the Yuppies are buying
condos so you can afford what Im
going to have to do to this place
We are talking from the ground
upsville

CHARLES
Thats fine Otho Just keep me
out of it I am here to relax
and clip coupons And goddamnit
I mean to do it

During this speech Otho has been surreptitiously posing
for Lydias camera She clicks the shutter

OTHO
(ignoring her)
Is the rest of the house as bad as
this

DELIA
The rest of the house is probably
worse When can you and I get
started

OTHO
No time like the present as my
wicked stepmother used to say

Unexpectedly Otho sweeps Barbaras entire collection of
CERAMIC and PORCELAIN HORSES from the mantlepiece They
all CRASH to the hearth except for one which Lydia
manages to catch
LYDIA
Otho thats terrible

OTHO
My sentiments exactly Porcelain
is for teeth

He takes the sale remaining porcelain horse out of Lydias
hand and flings it into the fireplace Lydia is sad

Then out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
jacket Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
were castanets They certainly sound like it

OTHO
Delia lets get this show on
the road

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At one end near the stairs leading up to the attic
Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls

BARBARA
Adam we are in hell I hate these
people

ADAM

They make gypsies look good

BARBARA
Is this a punishment for something
we did in life What can we do

ADAM
I dont know if theres anything
we can do

BARBARA
(determined)
Were not completely helpless
Ive been reading the book
Theres a word for people in our
predicament honey

Adam looks at her

BARBARA
Ghosts

Adam is shocked at the reality

Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
hallway
OTHO
Were dealing with negative
entertainment potential here
I mean theres absolutely no
organic walking flow-through

Otho looks down the hallway Its empty Adam and
Barbara are no longer there

DELIA
Whats wrong

OTHO
I thought I saw something

DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
orange -- the word MAUVE
DELIA
Okay
OTHO

(screaming with delight)
You read my mind I love clients
who can read my mind I dont
think people realize how strong

a connection there is between
interior decoration and the

supernatural
DELIA
(fawning)
I know I read your book The

Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf

OTHO
Gooood

Delia opens the door and they step inside another room

DELIA
This will be Lydias room

INT LYDIAS ROOM - DAY

Its not Lydias room yet of course because it still
has the Maitlands furniture in it Barbara had partly
wallpapered it before the accident Her tools are still
there

DELIA
What do you think

OTHO
Viridian
DELIA

Viridian What is
Otho spray-paints the word viridian on the wall -- plus
the word blue green -- and Cr2 03 right over a

picture of Adam and Barbara as kids

OTHO

Blue-green Hydrated chromic
oxide Remember Im schooled in
chemistry I was a hair analyst
Briefly Interior design is a
science Delia Think of me as
Doctor Otho

(looking at wall)
And this patient is truly sick

DELIA
Of course her favorite color
How beautiful

Otho stares straight into her eyes

OTHO
I will tell you what is
beautiful

Delia smiles Behind Delia and Otho the rooms CLOSET
DOOR swings slowly open with and OMINOUS CREAK

Delia and Otho turn that way with a suggestion of dread
Inside the closet Barbaras corpse is suspended from
the ceiling by a belt The CORPSE twists with a CREAK
and Barbara grins ghostly and slowly tears off her face
leaving nothing but muscle and bone beneath Her eye-
balls dangle on her cheeks

Delia and Otho stare aghast

DELIA
Oh my God

OTHO
Iknow We just have to pray
that the other closets are
bigger than this one

He walks over Looks inside

OTHO
Were these people dwarfes (sic)
(spies something)
OQooo Look

He finds neatly hung in plastic the Maitlands
wedding outfits Totally captivated by this powerful
image he peers through the plastic at them Holding
each up to Delia Barbara watches wide-eyed at them

OTHO
Ozzie
(holding up
her dress)
and Harriet What happened

to these people
Delia SLAMS the DOOR in Barbaras contorted face

DELIA
They died

INT HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Delia and Otho come out of Lydias bedroom Look around
Delia opens a door on the opposite side of the hallway
-- Adam and Barbaras old room They enter

INT BARBARA AND ADAMS OLD ROOM - DAY

The room looks like Barbara and Adam left it just a few
hours ago Delia and Otho poke around

OTHO
Yes but how did they die

Delia has gone over to the bathroom door and pushed it
wide open But before she goes in she stops a moment
to think

DELIA
I think they drowned

Behind Delia in the bathroom the old-fashioned bathtub
suddenly overflows with vile water Adams face-up
bloated corpse bobs to the surface His dead drowned
stare is ghastly

OTHO
Argh Look at this water
Mosquito central This will
be overtime Delia

He rolls his sleeve and reaches down into the water past
Adam who looks at him puzzled Otho pulls the plug on
the drain Water swirls out

Delia stares downward directly at the corpse then she
points at the floor

DELIA
Otho I cannot live with these
cheap domestic floor tiles

OTHO
Be brave Otho take care Onward

The bathroom is now empty No water no drowned corpse
Otho sneezes Shivers a bit

INT HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia come out of the master bedroom suite

OTHO
Is there much more of this
torture

DELIA

Thats Charles study But you
dont have to even look in there
Hell love whatever you do to

it Hes such a sheep

OTHO
Oh as long as were here

Otho reaches out and turns the knob The door swings
ominously open on

CHARLESS STUDY

This had been Adams reading and birdwatching study

Bird posters on the wall books everywhere Straight
out of Better Homes and Gardens 1963

There is one slight difference however because on the
rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adams headless
corpse Standing over him holding in one hand a long
knife and in the other Adams blood-and-gore dripping
head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face
Shrieking silently

OTHO
Ooo Deliver me from LL Bean

Inside the room the eyes of Adams severed head open
and look up at Barbara -- she stops screaming

ADAMS HEAD
They dont see us They cant
hear us

Outside Delia is shaking her head
DELIA

The woman who lived here had the
aesthetic instincts of Betty
Crocker

BARBARA
Im going to get her

DELIA
I cannot convey to you the extent
to which this house bores me

OTHO
I will tell you what is boring
(looking around
scientifically)
Once you cover up the wallpaper
knock down a few walls alter the

traffic patterns and -- perhaps
-- only perhaps -- think about an
inground pool -- the place might

just be livable Whats on the
third floor

DELIA
Attic space

OTHO
Lets see We could turn that

into a media room

They head up the stars to the attic

INT LYDIAS ROOM - SAME TIME
Adams head has a look of terror on it
ADAMS HEAD
Oh God I forgot to lock the
attic door
Adams headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
out of the room

INT STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia climbing The headless corpse careens
past them around the bend in the stairs and out of sight

OTHO
Did you feel something

Delia shakes her head

OTHO
I felt a cool wind

The expression on Othos face suggests he knows more than
hes telling

INT LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME

The headless corpse rushes through the open door into
the attic

INT ATTIC - SAME TIME

The headless corpse SLAMS the DOOR SHUT turns the key
in the lock Then he slumps against the locked door in
an exaggerated stance of relief

INT ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME
Delia tries the knob The door is locked

OTHO
You dont have a key

DELIA
Maybe Charles does

OTHO
I have a feeling theres some very
interesting space behind this door

DELIA
(sarcastic)
Probably the worlds largest Readers
Digest collection Cmon lets have
some chablis Otho Im laid bare by
this experience Entirely bare

INT GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Barbara still holding Adams head

ADAMS HEAD
Whew That was close

BARBARA
I cannot witness this

Barbara distractedly puts Adams head on a bookshelf
His headless body fumbles with the books and finally
reattaches the head

INT GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

Adam turns away from the window Barbara still with
her face unattached is fuming Shes trying unsuccessfully
to rip apart the handbook

BARBARA

Whats the good of being a ghost
if you cant frighten people to
death

She explodes and flings the handbook at the mirror

ADAM
Oh honey we may need that

BARBARA
No Im not putting up with this

She storms out of the room

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara storms in as if straight from the room upstairs
She heads straight for the back door Just as she opens
the door Adam rushes up

ADAM
Barbara honey Dont go out
there You dont know --

BARBARA
Whatever it is it cant be worse
than this

She flings open the door and steps outside She promptly
disappears

ADAM

Barbara
EXT SURFACE OF SATURNS MOON TITAN - DAY
Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an
enormous Saturn looming in the sky She looks around
with wonder and some fear
A sulfur volcano erupts in the distance A METEOR
CRASHES with a lurid EXPLOSION As from a great distance

she hears Adams voice Like thunder

ADAM
Barbara

She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers
the surface of this distant moon

BARBARAS POV
Adam is trudging towards her Behind him hovering

isolated in the air is the kitchen door

BACK TO SCENE

Adam at last catches up with her Surveys around them
BARBARA

Oh Adam Find somebody Im
getting all yellow Do something

Behind them something is burrowing rapidly toward them
through the sand The something could be right out of
Dune

Barbara and Adam stare for a moment then Adam grabs her
and pulls her toward the kitchen door But the kitchen
door has moved so they veer in the new direction

The something follows them and rises out of the sand

ON SOMETHING

It is a very big very nasty and very hungry snapping
SANDWORM It ROARS and lunges at them

Barbara slightly angered at it instinctively bats at it

The sandworm is momentarily stunned at Barbaras
audacity It freezes and shakes its loathesome head

Barbara bats at it again Adam is wide-eyed tries to
pull her away The SANDWORM recovers and ROARS after
them

Adam grabs Barbara and tries to escape but they slip
and sink in the sand They make it to the door just in
time swing it open and hurl themselves through The
DOOR SHUTS with a BANG just in front of the ROARING
SANDWORM

The SANDWORM rears and ROARS in frustration HOWLING
to the ringed planet

INT KITCHEN

Barbara weeping throws herself in Adams arms

BARBARA
Oh Adam dont ever leave me
alone

ADAM

You left me
BARBARA
I know Im sorry

She hugs him tight
BARBARA
I just realized that I could have
been killed alone Dont ever

leave me honey

Both contemplate that horror

BARBARA
Were trapped in this house
forever with those people
ADAM

You cant say that for sure It
could be a transitional thing
Like a post-life crisis We just
have to be tougher with them
Come on Have some brandy
Spirits get it

BARBARA
(a tentative smile)
Death didnt improve your sense
of humor

They head for the dining room

INT DINING ROOM

Adam has his arms around Barbaras shoulder They walk
in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their dinner
Lydias back is to them Barbara and Adam back out of
the room but stop to listen

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Deetzes around the dining room table There are
candles and good china laid out -- but theyre eating
out of Chinese take-out boxes

DELIA
I cant believe that were eating
Cantonese Is there no Szechuan
up here Hunan

CHARLES
Theres only one Chinese restaurant
in town darling the owners are
Irish and Irish people happen to
cook Cantonese They dont know
better

LYDIA
I plan to have a stroke from the
amount of MSG thats in this food

DELIA
This is our first meal in this
house Lydia Why dont we all
do our little private parts to
make it a pleasant one

CHARLES
Lydia relax Well build you a
darkroom in the basement

LYDIA
(dramatically)
My whole life is a darkroom One
» big dark room

Delia rolls her eyes and nods Shes been through this
before

DELIA
Nonsense youll go to school
get a bike maybe have an ant farm
Maybe meet a farm boy

Delia laughs Charles smiles

LYDIA

(doleful)

Yeah maybe if hes nice hell

let me hang myself from a rope
in his barn

CHARLES
Lydia were the first trickle
In a couple of years this whole
town will be filled with people
like us

DELIA
Well be the art center of summer
New York Ill teach those phony
gallery creeps to refuse my
sculpture And when Otho and I
get through with this house you
people are not going to recognize
it

LYDIA

(dramatically)

I say lets keep it the way it is

Charles and Delia stare at her simultaneously
unbelieving

LYDIA
I do I really like it I mean
its already sort of like somebodys
home isnt it Their couch is
comfortable and doesnt stick to
your legs It smells like a real
home not a French whorehouse

There is a pause as if the family were considering this
whole business in a new light Then the moment and the
light fade

DELIA
Lydia at your age you are so
young

(back to business)
Charles we need to call that
awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow
and get the key to the attic
door Cant you find a way to
hold back some of her commission

CHARLES
Were going to have a lot to do
tomorrow The Goodwill truck is

coming and whatever is up there
in that attic goes away with it
Should have it fumigated too I
saw a fly today

Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and anger

OUTSIDE DOOR - ON STAIRS

Listening sit Barbara and Adam A tear rolls down her
face

INT ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor peering
out of one of the small windows overlooking the front
yard of the house The handbook open in front of them

EXT FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARAS POV - DAY

The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their
vehicles Plumbers electricians cable TV men etc
Goodwill truck arrives MOS Charles directs the Goodwill
men to a pile of the Maitlands furniture They grab one
of Barbaras prized antique tables and fling it up into
the truck
In the road in front of the house are several cars of
rubbernecking locals astonished by all the activity
The city has come to town

INT ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say

were next Adam leafs through the handbook furiously
BARBARA
Look in the index maybe

theres like an emergency number
or something

ADAM
Not really whats this

Adam pulls from the book an ancient yellowed crumbling
handbill He carefully opens it
ON HANDBILL
Very primitive crude red printing
ADAM (VO)
(reading)

Trouble with the living House
full of pesky arrogant live people

If you got the dough I make em
go Betelgeuse the Bio Buster
Betelegeuse Betelgeuse Betel

The remainder of the sheet is torn off

ON BARBARA

fingering the torn edge Looking in the book for the
remainder No luck

BARBARA
Thats it No number or

instructions

ADAM
Nothing The bio buster I dont
get it
A THUNDERING CRASH shakes the house They both scurry
to the window to see what has happened below

EXT FRONT AND SIDE YARDS - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION -- small vignettes
Charles flails his arms at a dimwitted crane operator
who is unsuccessfully trying to get a 2500 pound Vulcan
range through a formerly too small kitchen window Now
a gaping hole in the wall

Moving men watch and then continue to move in the Deetzs
modern expensive and ugly furniture They collide with
Goodwill men coming out with the Maitlands lovely
antiques and personal possessions

Delia shreiks periodically at some fine art movers who
are struggling under her horrid modern welded steel
sculptures

Lydia snaps photos of the mayhem She stops to scan the
whole house

LYDIAS POV

When her gaze reaches to top of the house she suddenly
glimpses Barbara and Adams faces in the window

BACK TO SCENE

Lydia blinks hard Her mouth drops open She looks all
around -- as if shed just seen a ghost or two

Jane Butterfields car pulls up and Jane gets out
Little Jane sits in the front seat burdened with an
enormous stack of collated and stapled copies Jane
waves to Charles but he doesnt see her and walks away
She walks in his direction

Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over squeezing be-
tween two vans

Little Jane locks her door in fear of Lydia -- the
strange Lydia stares at her

LITTLE JANE
Are you a boy or a girl

LYDIA
I only speak to vertebrates
Wheres your old lady

Jane comes up

JANE
Well theres a Little Deetz at
least Boy when you city people
do something you do it right

LYDIA
What happened to the people who
used to live here

LITTLE JANE
(ratty little voice)
They drowned

JANE
Yes they were my best friends
in all the world I was
devastated
(beat)
Here darling

Jane hands a key to Lydia

LYDIA
(impressed)
Is this the key to the attic

JANE

Thats a skeleton key Itll
open any door in that house Will
you give it to your father

(handing her a

business card)
And you might mention that I
single-handedly decorated the
house In case he needs advice
in that area Come see me

Jane goes away After a few steps she looks back
JANE

Are we going to be seeing you at
Miss Shannons Boarding School

LYDIA
Yes but Im going to live at
home

JANE

Remind me to talk to your mother
about the dress code

(walking off)
Im sure youre going to be very
happy there

LITTLE JANE
(sarcastically)
You bet We love new kids

Jane drives off Little Jane stares back with her grubby
little grin Lydias face sobers as she looks up at the
now empty attic window
DELIA (OS)
Help Get off me

Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surreptitiously
She follows Delias SHRIEKING

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia pinned flat against
the house by one of her horrid steel sculptures Two
movers are struggling to free her Lydia snaps a quick
photograph

They finally free Delia She clutches at her head just
short of tearing her hair out

DELIA

You jerks That is my art and
it is dangerous You think I
want to die like that

(seeing Lydia)
Lydia Moving is a family affair
So buckle down now and go get
Mommy some drugs

LYDIA
Any particular kind

DELIA
Joke Joke Aspirin It doesnt
matter what brand

Lydia walks off toward the house

INT ATTIC - DAY
Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window

BARBARA
That little girl saw us

ADAM
She couldnt have We cant
make them see us

BARBARA
But she saw us I could feel it

ADAM
(pause thinking
that over)
Thats all we need

Lydia goes off towards the house Looks up at the window
again No one there
INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing Shes a
little scared She decides to go up the dark stairs

INT HALL

At the end of the hall stands Charles directing men who
are carrying books into the room that will be his study
Charles sees her

CHARLES
Where is your mother

LYDIA
(very quick decisive
delivery)
Stepmother
(back to regular
speech)
Shes out torturing the movers

CHARLES
Lydia Try to be civil Im
going to see if I can set up a
noise-free zone in the study
He continues on
A BLAST of STEAM --
-- fills the hallway because workmen are already going

at the wallpaper Lydia emerges from it Looking up at
stairway to attic Mounting courage

INT STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY
Lydia creeps upward taking the skeleton key from her
pocket She stops momentarily when she hears her

fathers voice somewhere behind her

CHARLES (0OS)
Lydia Lydia

Then when that voice is covered by OTHER SOUNDS of the
MOVING she continues upward FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK
INT ATTIC - DAY

Adam works on his model He hears the SQUEAK looks up
confidently
ADAM
(whispering)
Dont worry Ive locked it

INT ATTIC LANDING

Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic
door She turns it The key is stiff She turns
harder Its stuck Lydia tries the door -- its no
go She turns the key again This time it goes all
the way around

INT ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam surprised by the key look at each
other carefully very quietly stand up and tiptoe
toward door

Suddenly -- on the screen of an old TV set in the corner
of the attic a ghostly image POPS ON

ON TV

A bizarre smallish fellow outfitted in a too-big cowboy
hat bad wig and over-sized sunglasses appears on screen
singing very quickly (Its a heavily disguised
Betelgeuse)

Behind him the camera quickly pans an assortment of tomb-
stones a la Cal Worthington

BETELGEUSE
(singing)
Have the living got you down
Betelgeuse
Are they jacking you around
Betelgeuse
Have you broken out in hives
cause youre tired of their jive
I will drive them from your hive
Betelgeuse

Camera tilts down a flashing tombstone with BETELGEUSE
written on it

ADAM

rushes over to shut it off He cant find a plug He
looks around behind set no workings inside at all
He peers around to the screen It is blank Suddenly

Betelgeuse POPS ON AGAIN

BETELGEUSE
Say it once Betelgeuse

Say it twice Betelgeuse
The third times a charm
Betelgeuse

Come on down

He POPS OFF Adam and Barbara stare at each other

INT LANDING - DAY

Lydia listens Did she hear something She puts her
hand on the knob and tries to turn it Its stuck

Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on
floor

Charles head suddenly appears behind her Scares her

CHARLES
What are you doing

INT ATTIC
Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door With
her knitting needle Barbara has poked the key out The

two stand absolutely still listening terrified of the
living intruders

INT ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES
LYDIA
I was just trying to open the
door Mrs Butterfield brought
over a skeleton key
CHARLES
Let me have it

INT ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam tighten

ON LANDING

LYDIA
But it doesnt work

She hands her father the key He looks at it and throws
it in the corner

CHARLES
Skeleton keys never work Anyway

LYDIA
(very quick decisive
delivery)
Stepmother
CHARLES

Do you understand Noise free
He goes down the stairs

LYDIA
Dad

He continues
CHARLES
(irritated over
his shoulder)

LYDIA
Im lonely

A BLAST of STEAM from below drowns out her words
Charles stops and turns around The blast stops

CHARLES
What
EXT YARD AND BARN

Delia comes out of the barn tearing her hair She
screams up at the house

DELIA
Where are my drugs
TIGHT ON LYDIA
She is resolved

LYDIA
Nothing

Charles continues She begins to follow slowly

ON KEY
Behind Lydia Adam rushes out the door grabs the key
and rushes back in again Lydia hears something but
doesnt see

INT ATTIC
Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door

ADAM
Theres nothing we can do Its
just a matter of time before they
unlock this room There goes my
model There goes our last
refuge

BARBARA
Were not going to wait here like
cornered animals I can tell you
that We need help Im going

ADAM
What about this Beetle guy

BARBARA
We dont know who he is
(thinking)

ADAM
Are you crazy She cant hear

ADAM

(looking through

the handbook)
We need some help I found
something this morning Here
Emergencies

(reads)
In case of emergency draw door

BARBARA
Draw door I dont know why we
keep looking in that stupid
book

Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on
the exposed brick of the chimney

BARBARA
You dont actually think this
is going to work

Adam draws a doorknob Then he tries to turn it The
door perhaps to his surprise fails to open

BARBARA
Yet another triumph for Adam

and Barbara in the afterlife

ADAM
Wait

He looks at book then writes on the door KNOCK AND
ENTER He exchanges a glance with Barbara Shes even

more skeptical than before Turns away in disgust

Adam knocks on the door and turns the knob Nothing
She is more disgusted Adam goes back to the book

ADAM
Aha Knock three times

He knocks three times Turns knob The chalked door
swings magnificently open

Behind is an eerie light source SOARING MUSIC maybe
even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables

Barbara and Adam look at one another again They hold
hands and step tentatively through

Their figures are lost in the blinding light

They start to shut door after them

ON ATTIC LANDING

Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the
attic door It suddenly goes out

ON LYDIA

She is dumbfounded She listens

INT ATTIC - DAY

Deserted silence Just the chalkmarked door

ON LANDING

Lydia speeds down the steps
INT CHARLES STUDY - DAY

Charles fiercely intent on relaxing paces like a
catfish out of water Ralph Lauren in K-mart He
stretches He sits uneasily in an easy chair tries
like hell to get comfortable Finally he puts a book
under his bottom to get sitting straight Looks around
tapping his fingers What to do Looks at watch

He takes down a book from Adams library it is an
Audubon book of birds He whips through it like its
the comics and then looks around for more

He finds the Illustrated Walden by Thoreau He speed
reads it

He is now really bored Goes to the fireplace tries to
light it Cannot do it Goes to desk and writes

OTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN
STUDY

He studies bird posters Finds beautiful cardinal
picture

Takes field glasses and looks out window

ON CHARLES
Horrified Wrinkles his nose

Lydia enters He jumps

CHARLES

Lydia is shocked
CHARLES
Darling cant you see Im relaxing
in here
LYDIA

Well I just wanted to tell you
what I saw

CHARLES
Lydia What the hell is the point
of my moving up here if you people
wont let me relax Go help your
mother

Charles returns to field glasses spies something She
looks at him in frustration

LYDIA
(on her way out)
Fine Maybe you can relax ina
haunted house But I cant

She exits Charles peers after her brow furrowed
Looks out again at the village Uses his field glasses
to get a better look

HIS POV

It is the Bozman Building Ernie is out front polishing
the brass lion

ON CHARLES

He thinks Moves the field glasses to punctuate his

discovery of the building (His eyes never leave field
glasses throughout the following)

CHARLES
Nice building Bad paint
Good lines bad roof
Good parking hmmm

That really registers with him Without looking he dials
a familiar number on the phone with one hand lifts the
receiver He clacks his teeth together purposefully

SECRETARY (VO)
Botco International

CHARLES
Yes Id like to speak with Maxie
Dean

SECRETARY (VO)
Hes not in right now

CHARLES
Well tell him that Charles Deetz
called

He hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building
Clacks his teeth

CHARLES
My God what I could do with that
parking
DISSOLVE TO

TIGHT - BARBARA AND ADAM

Very still they look cautiously to the right and left
-- just with their eyes Theyre astounded by what
they see though we dont yet see it

ADAM
Not what I expected when we
walked through that door

BARBARA
No But its somewhere without
big worms

CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are
in

INT WAITING ROOM - DAY

The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember
waiting in Fifties furniture with broken legs couches
propped up on telephone books Standing ashtrays with
dirty sand Linoleum floors patched a hundred times
National Geographics with the covers torn off The Take
a number registers in the millions

As the CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE of the room we see a
RECEPTIONIST Shes the quintessential 50s receptionist
-- tight sweater bullet-breasted bra bleached hair red
lipstick Shes wearing a ribbon across her breast reading
MISS ARGENTINA and there are knife slashes across

both wrists

RECEPTIONIST
You dont have an appointment do

ADAM
W We didnt know how to make
one

BARBARA

An appointment for what

RECEPTIONIST
What do you want

BARBARA

one nine months ago and you want
help

ADAM
Nine months What difference
does that make

RECEPTIONIST
(shrugging)
Good luck Youre going to use
up all your help vouchers

ADAM
Help vouchers

RECEPTIONIST
D-90s You spend a hundred
and twenty-five years on earth
actually in that house during
which you get only three class-
one D-90 intercessions with Juno
You probably havent even read
through the manual completely
yet

BARBARA
Why three

The Receptionist holds up both hands each of which have
only three fingers on them

RECEPTIONIST
Rule Number Three Everything
comes in threes Youll have
to wait if you dont have an
appointment

BARBARA
How long do we have to wait

ADAM
Wait for who

RECEPTIONIST
For Juno your caseworker Not
that it matters to your type But
there are all these other people
here ahead of you Id say three
hours

The waiting room is now filled with people Dead people
some in fairly awful states A cornucopia of carnal

shreddage

Adam and Barbara look around for a moment then very
quietly they reach out to grasp hands

RECEPTIONIST
Number 54 million six hundred

INT ATTIC LANDING - DAY

Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver a nail file an
ice pick and a credit card She inserts nail file into
the door She struggles and after several attempts --
finally uses the ice pick and POP The door swings open
ominously

INT ATTIC - DAY

Lydia enters The room is dim and filled with dust
motes There are shadows in all the corners

She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and
moon and that eerily illuminates the model town Shes
frightened then entranced

She peers at it from different angles her fear for-
gotten She notes small tools scattered around an un-
finished area She continues around the model oblivious
to everything else Then

A LOUD CRASH --

She whirls around barely stifling a scream It was only
a pushbroom that she knocked from its hook on the wall

Recovering she kicks something Ducks under the table
and comes up with something holds it up to the light
Its the handbook She looks through it Finds the
marked page looks at the chalk door

INT OFFICE - DAY

Barbara and Adam are still holding hands as if they
hadnt moved Like waiting for an IRS audit

BARBARA
(to Adam)
Is this what happens when you die

The Receptionist overhears She points at Barbara

RECEPTIONIST
This is what happens when YOU die
(points to another

That is what happens when HE dies
That is what happens when THEY
die Its highly personal And
Ill tell you something if I
knew then what I know now I
wouldnt have had my little
accident

She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke
wriggles them indicating her slashes

OTHER CORPSES
(all together)
Amen

Barbara and Adam look at them Corpses resume doing
what they were doing A GRINDING NOISE OS -- the
Receptionist looks up

Barbara and Adam also look OS

THEIR POV

A message delivery WIRE GRINDS along LOUDLY on a pulley
The actual message is held in the hand of THE MESSENGER
a flattened corpse suspended as if a shirt on a clothes-
line tire marks on his face and clothing A major
roadkill Dust and gravel ground into him

BACK TO SCENE

He smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist
takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it

RECEPTIONIST
Maitland party of two Take
your handbook and go to the
sixth door

Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook

BARBARA
We forgot our handbook

CUT TO

INT ATTIC - DAY
Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest

CHARLES (0OS)
(from distant
downstairs)
Lydia Delia needs your help
Lydia gives one more look at the book and then goes to
the door quickly and silently

CHARLES (0OS)
Right now Delia says

INT OFFICE - DAY

RECEPTIONIST

(shaking her head

in disgust)
Out that way through the typing
pool down the corridor sixth
door on your left Sixth door
Two threes

(shaking her head)
Airhead

Adam and Barbara walk through a door

INT TYPING POOL - DAY

A vast room of desks arranged in a grid straight out of
How To Succeed In Business Each desk is occupied too
but most of the secretaries are merely skeletons or
mouldering corpses slumped over their typewriters

Only one secretary somewhere in the vast grid is typing
slowly with long pauses between words

The Messenger on his return trip parallels Barbara and
Adam as they walk along Barbara cant look at him

MESSENGER
How do I look Therere no
mirrors on this side

ADAM
(trying to be
pleasant)
Fine you look fine

MESSENGER
Thanks Ive been feeling a
little flat

He goes back through the very very narrow slot in the
wall where the line runs Adam and Barbara look to the
right and left A vast stack of files slips off a desk
and spills out onto the floor

Barbara and Adam enter corridor

INT CORRIDOR - DAY
Empty like a hotel corridor but all the doors are of
different types -- a revolving door a dutch door church
doors They walk past a waist-high window covered by a
roll-up shade

BARBARA
A hundred twenty-five years
I cant believe it I cant
believe they didnt tell us

She bumps into the SHADE and it rolls up FLAPPING She
stares in through the window Adam peers in too

THEIR POV

A smouldering mist-filled room From the smoky plasma
floats an occasional tortured soul Unspeakably SAD
MUSIC wafts from within They get only a glimpse of
the bodies in this horrible human soup

BACK TO SCENE

BARBARA
Adam look at this

Suddenly floating up from below immediately on the
other side of the window a white-crepe face emerges

It seems to be that of a woman her eyes are red and
blue tears rim them Her pale skin is covered with a
flaking crust of salt She wears the saddest look ever
Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes

BARBARA
Oh Adam what is this

A reflection joins them on their side of the window

A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR -- wizened and efficient
pulls the shade down firmly

SINISTER MAN
Thats the lost souls room A
room for ghosts who have been
exorcised Poor devils Thats
death for the dead Its all in
the handbook Keep moving

The man scuttles off Adam and Barbara walk on sadly
until they come to a door that looks exactly like the
swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of
their house

ADAM
This is it the sixth door
Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everything is dark quiet -- but the furniture is obvi-
ously not theirs and neither is the decoration Adam
and Barbara exchange glances and push on through into
the living room

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Quiet dark Everyones asleep

ADAM
My God were back where we
started

BARBARA

Look at this everything is
different down here All our
furniture is gone

ADAM
How long do you suppose we were
waiting
JUNO
Three months
A spot comes on revealing JUNO -- their case worker

Shes an older woman no nonsense about her Overdressed
in an outfit that includes a blouse with ruffled cuffs
We will at some point catch a glimpse of her slashed
throat -- She smokes heavily Occasionaly smoke puffs
from her cut throat

JUNO
Id nearly given up on you I
was about to leave I do have
other clients

BARBARA
Are you Juno our case worker

JUNO
Yes I evaluate individual cases
and determine if help is needed
deserved and available

BARBARA
We need help We deserve help

ADAM
Are you available
JUNO
No

Whats wrong

BARBARA
Were very unhappy

JUNO
What do you expect Youre dead

ADAM
Wed like some help in getting
rid of the people who moved in
here Barbara and I worked very
hard on this house

BARBARA
We probably wouldnt mind sharing
the house with people who were --

JUNO
-- Like you used to be

BARBARA
Yes

ADAM
But these people --

He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delias sculpture
Juno walks around it shaking her head

The following conversation takes place as Barbara and
Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends
up in their attic space They walk through doors survey
the Deetzes on the way

JUNO

Hell is other people You
obviously dont read much
Besides things seem pretty quiet
here You should thank God you
didnt die in Italy

(checking the file)
The Deetzes Okay Have you

any good to pull your heads off
in front of people if they cant

ADAM
We have to start simpler is
that it

JUNO
Start simply Do what you know

only help those who help themselves
Just do a little at a time And
of course practice practice
practice Its tricky but -- you
werent murderers by any chance

BARBARA
No

JUNO
Pity Murderers seem to have an
easy time of it Just look at
Amityville
(reminiscing)
He was one of my boys Didnt
have to give that one any lessons
From day one But I must be off
Ive got a planeload of
football players crashed in the
midwest they need a lot of help
just with the basics

her head indicating dumbness

BARBARA
If we have trouble What about

JUNO
(quickly interrupting
her)
No You dont want his help

Adam and Barbara look at each other Puzzled
ADAM and BARBARA
Well We might

INT ATTIC - NIGHT

Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest A FLY
BUZZES around her Juno blows it away Fly flees

JUNO
No you dont He does not work
well with others

BARBARA
What do you mean Whats he do

JUNO
Hes a freelance bio-exorcist
Claims to get rid of the living
But hes a troublemaker Hes
pushy Hes been sleazing around
that cemetery for 500 years

BARBARA
Our cemetery

JUNO

Yeah

(looking around)
He still tries popping up all
over the place But he cant join
the party unless you call on him

(stronger)
Get the Deetzes out by yourselves
I gotta go

She sucks on cigarette and smoke billows out the hole in
her throat Juno starts to fade

BARBARA
(persistently)
But what if we do need this
Betelgeuse

Juno fades

JUNO
(angrily)
Dont say his name Just practice
Do it yourself

ADAM
And if we need you again how do

we

He turns around but Juno is gone Barbara goes to the
model looks at the cemetery

BARBARA
That guy is in our cemetery Oh
Adam

ADAM

(holds her shoulders
calms her)
Look shes right Well just
start simple honey be tougher
I feel confident Cmon

They exit

CAMERA FOLLOWS action -- OVER the model -- the FLY BUZZES
It lands and crawls along into the model of the cemetery

CLOSEUP - FLY

Now large scale crawls past gravestones marked Johnson
Burton Olson and Lee finally to a crooked gravestone
overgrown with ivy

The Fly resplendently green and iridescent pauses and
fiddles with its hairy parts Starts to walk by

VOICE (0OS)
Pssstt Over here

Fly stops Tilts its multi-eyed head

ANOTHER ANGLE

Two hands come up from the earth of that grave White
gloves holding a golden dripping comb of honey

VOICE (0OS)
I cant use this You should
have it Flies get so little
respect anymore

The flattered Fly walks over to the grave Ina flash
-- the hands grab the struggling Fly and dance it like
a doll over the grave and then pull it into the earth

FLY

Hellp me Hellp me

A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave WIND BLOWS as
the Fly disappears Ivy whips away from the gravestone

Barbara moans louder and more weirdly
Delia stirs sits up but doesnt open her eyes

Adam and Barbara are excited then disappointed as
Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote control
device and without opening her eyes turns OFF the
TELEVISION set Then she turns over and is lost to the
world totally

Barbara sighs She and Adam walk toward the door When
they open it however Lydia is standing there in her
pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam and
Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright

LYDIA
Sick Sexual perversion Total
gross-out If youre going to do
weird sexual stuff you ought to
stay in your bedroom okay You
want me to be more twisted than I
am Its so embarrassing

Lydia starts back into her room Then looks at the
developing photograph Something catches her eye

Holy cow No feet

She screams Adam and Barbara scream Lydia rushes back
toward them starts FLASHING pictures Adam and Barbara

Lydia blushes Barbara smiles warmly She is beginning
to like Lydia

laugh and cuffs Lydia lightly He laughs louder as he
looks at photo again

of bills)

Lydia exits with determination Charles looks up on the
wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter River

just like Adams in the attic

CHARLES
Look at the size of these lots

Adam peers at the map puzzled

ADAM

Barbara follows Lydia out Adam thinks intrigued
Exits

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Delia is frantically preparing for the evenings dinner

I told them you were too mean to

only thing that scares me is being
embarrassed in front of my
friends Do you know how hard it
is to get civilized people to set
foot in this part of Connecticut
Not a solitary word of this
pubescent tripe to anyone

Lydia exits angrily

CAMERA HINGES Barbara is watching horrified at Delias

at the cemetery with his magnifying glass

REVERSE ANGLE ON HER MAGNIFIED EYES
BARBARA
Did you copy these gravestones

ADAM (0S)
Of course I did

BARBARA
Then it should be here
BACK TO SCENE
She searches the tiny graves

BARBARA
Burton Lee Bozman Wait

She takes a tweezer and moves some ivy on the Betelgeuse
grave Adam approaches

BARBARA

Zap They are transported into the model-graveyard

EXT INSIDE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

WIND BLOWS -- with shovels and lanterns Adam and Barbara
are unlikely gravediggers

The mechanized clouds move in the sky across the
mechanical moon throwing weird shadows everywhere
Ground fog creeps slowly along the graves It is
so eerie

BARBARA
What happened

ADAM
Three times Powerful number

BARBARA
(standing in front
of grave)
Bet el geuse What an
awful name JI thought it was
like -- you know The juice of
beetles
Adam cringes too
BARBARA

Where is he What do we do

Adam looks down at the grave Knocks on the stone
Nothing

ADAM
Has anything been simple so far
From the look of the shovel we
dig

BARBARA
Oh Adam I dont have gloves My
nails keep getting longer Ill
break them

Hands her a shovel anyway She digs

EXT INSIDE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT (LATER)
Theyre almost down six feet By now they are both
almost out of sight in the grave Inside the grave

Adam suddenly hits wood

BARBARA
Its about time

They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate coffin
BETELGEUSE

ADAM
I guess we open it

BARBARA
Maybe we should knock first

A slight TREMOR shakes them They look at each other and
try to scramble from the grave
TOPSIDE

They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse
springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbaras back and
plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips She screams
and burbles Adam pulls the corpse off her back The
corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adams head Adam
staggers backward unhurt but shocked All three stop
Something unreal about the corpse almost mechanical

Then the corpse grinning insanely at them flies straight
up into the air over their heads He crashes against the
tombstone

And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge mari-
onette on a string and pole A LAUGH comes from behind
the gravestone

And out steps the puppeteer Betelgeuse He is small and
wiry with vaguely middle-eastern features This is one
slippery customer Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot
choosing words and phrases from every slang in the

world Barbara is mighty uneasy

BETELGEUSE
All right Who are you

BARBARA

Youre the dead

ADAM

BETELGEUSE
(rubbing hands)
How does she feel about short old
men with dirty ears

Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy Beetle
Juice senses it and gets back to business

BETELGEUSE
So you the dead want me the
undead to throw the live guys --
Mommie Daddy and Lolita who
might not mind a tumble with an
older guy out into the cold
Even though they have paid hard
casharoonie for your dump

ADAM
But the Deetzes are destroying
our house

BETELGEUSE

(scolding sarcasm)
You Maitlands are the backbone of
the afterlife So whats my cut

Pleased he laughs at himself

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Dinner for seven as promised Everything looks very
nice Deetzes are in control and in their element The
element is neurotic-chic

Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having had
to make the long drive to Connecticut Theres a bitchy
feud going on between GRACE the Art In America writer
and BERNARD Delias agent that threatens to become a
full-scale war

Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite occupation
-- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses of
his friends

Hes singled out his victim BERYL the editor for
Ballantine a frail-looking woman who is dressed
artistically

OTHO

(to Beryl)
Well darling you can only have
a hysterectomy once so why dont
you tell us what you really went
into the hospital for last week
Or dare I ask is that a nose
nouveau

Beryl stands to get a drink
CHARLES
(privately to Otho)
Otho youve got to help me get
Maxie Dean up here I have a
deal that could make all of us
very comfortable

OTHO
Hes a cloven-hooved beast

CHARLES
Hes your cousin

OTHO
I am ashamed to say he is Look
nothing short of giving away free
sacks of money would get him up
here Charles And Sarah Forget
it You cant get her out of
Bergdorfs with plastic
explosives

DELIA
Lets sit down everyone

They do Beryl returns Otho smells blood

I just hope it wasnt yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts
You know what they say about
people who commit suicide In the
afterlife they become civil
servants

BERNARD
Otho I didnt know you were into
the supernatural

OTHO
Of course you remember After my
stint with the living theatre I
was one of New York Citys leading
paranormal researchers until the
bottom dropped out of the business
in 72

BERYL
(sick to death of
this blowhard)
Paranormal Is that what theyre
calling your kind now

Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully Suddenly very curious
Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here

DELIA
(a threat quietly
to Lydia)
Dont you dare

LYDIA
I saw some ghosts

All quiet

DELIA
(interrupting)
Lydia tried to play a most amusing
joke on me this afternoon

LYDIA
It wasnt a joke

DELIA
Tried to convince me that this
house is haunted Kids Kids
Kids I love them

Othos glance sharpens at this Everyone listens

GRACE
By ghosts

LYDIA
By what else

DELIA

(laughing it away)
In sheets yet Designer sheets
They --

Charles seeing things arent going well for Delia proposes
a toast

CHARLES
I propose a toast to our intrepid
friends who braved the expressway
and fourteen toll booths to visit
us May your buildings go condo

All lift their wineglasses All drink All synchro-
nously spit out their wine All together now

EVERYONE
Yechhh

Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler Disgust
spans the room
ON BOTTLE

It bears the familiar spread wings of Thunderbird

BACK TO SCENE

BERYL
Thunderbird wine My God Delia
dont you even have a Safeway up
here

DELIA
(horrified but
recovering)
Joke Joke Charles get the good
wine and Ill serve the sushi
Its a joke

Delia stares a spike through Lydia Delia and Charles
rush into the kitchen Otho looks at his glass and peers
at Lydia

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Delia rushes to get the sushi Charles finds some good
wine

DELIA

(rapidly furious)
Lydia switched wines Charles --
if you do not agree right now to
boarding her out right now you can
forget having what you call sex --
ever again in your natural
lifetime

He nods reluctantly She rushes back to guests

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is looking around curiously Delia and Charles
rush back in with sushi and good wine Delia pours for
Bernard the obvious connoisseur He tastes the wine

All wait Is it Kerosene du Pape He smiles All smile
Beryl tastes her sushi and smiles

BERYL
Im famished

DELIA
Isnt that a great grape So

melodic exotic

Otho is more interested in Lydias story He leans
toward her

OTHO
Now Lydia Favor us about your
ghosts

DELIA
No Do not encourage this
little person

OTHO

Oh Delia lighten up

DELIA
Shes been without therapy up
here and I will not allow her to
ruin

But then something comes over Delia -- She straightens
then crouches a little her hand sweeps across in front

of her almost mechanically And then our Delia Deetz
unable to help herself leaves the white bread world behind
and possessed sings in someone elses voice a rich NEGRO
TENOR

DELIA
Tf I didnt care More than
words could say

Lydias eyes widen MUSIC UP All the guests are spell-
bound

Charles too has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes
In a voice not his own

CHARLES
If my every prayer did not
begin and end with just your
name

Delia is shocked She looks at Lydia

DELIA
For Gods sake stop me

She is cut short by her powerful inspiration

DELIA
I could not be true to you
beyond compare

Suddenly all the guests except Lydia are possessed to
become the chorus They stand by their chairs they spin
in perfect Motown choreography

EVERYONE
(except Lydia)
Shoo doo wop Shoo doo wop

DELIA
If I didnt care for you
EVERYONE

Shoo doo wop Shoo doo wop

A look of sheer delight comes across Lydias face unlike
anything we have previously seen She dances and claps
her hands in time with the music She is in teen heaven

NOTE Delia and the guests are fully aware of their
singingactions but helpless to stop themselves While
it is funny it is nevertheless just a little frighten-
ing Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she
can see the ghosts She cant

Now the song pauses Everyone tries to recover for a
shocked second Instead the tempo changes As the
tempo quickens the guestchorus is syncopated like al-
ternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled into
their chairs They sing throughout

Lydia loves it Suddenly caught up in the moment she
rushes to the table and in one swoop pulls the tablecloth
from under all the plates revealing the clear glass

top She is then swept back away from the table She
giggles with delight at her trick

LYDIA
Wheeeee

The song crashes to its end Bernard looks down at his
sushi The shrimp draped over the rice roll suddenly
rears up like a hand and making a tiny fist grabs his
dangling tie and smash --

All the guests are punched by sushi back over their
chairs to the ground They are stunned Suddenly every-
one runs frightened into the next room

OUTSIDE ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces dance
the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front of

the attic Door is open

TOGETHER
We did it

ADAM
Lets watch em scatter

INT ATTIC
They enter the attic and run to the window
over the front yard

Charles vehicles

ADAM (OS)

Any minute now Theyll all run

BARBARA
Your Ink Spots were wonderful

Adam smiles proudly

ADAM
And your sushi was remarkable

BARBARA
The sushi I did the wine

ADAM
N No I just did the Ink
Spots

BARBARA (VO)
Who did the sushi

Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic

Look out

as Delia and

Barbara glances at Adam They dont know what to do

LYDIA (0S)

Adam puzzled goes to the door and opens it

standing there sheepish

LYDIA
Theyd like for you to come
downstairs Delia says you can
pick any sheets you want

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is

The guests are sitting expectantly The photographs
are being passed around Otho thinks that this is the
choicest thing that ever happened to a family The

wheels are turning in Charles mind -- he sees a gold-
mine Everyone speaks at once
DELIA

It does indicate a marvelously
urbane sense of humor on the part
of these ghosts -- that they
actually appear in sheets

OTHO
Were dealing with Tracy and
Hepburn here a very sophisticated
pair We must protect them
treat them with respect nurture
them

CHARLES
People will pay big money for
this Right Grace

GRACE
(nodding)
Charles I want to know why you
didnt tell me about this --

DELIA
(now changing her
tune)
We were waiting for proof
Lydias photographs

Charles is scheming

BERNARD
(skeptical)
What are you all talking about
We we just got a little drunk
thats all

OTHO
No matter how drunk you get you
cannot sound like the Ink Spots
(to Charles)
Charles this is it You can get
Maxie Dean up here now

Charles plots and plans

OTHO
His wife Sarah loves the
supernatural I did a reading
for her just last week Told
her her jowls would tighten
soon I mean she will make him
sprint up here in his helicopter
if you can produce ghosts for her

BERYL
The Enquirer has offered fifty
thousand dollars for absolute
proof of life after death Ill
send them over

BERNARD
Im Delias agent Ive lost
money for years on her work If
anything actually happened here
Ill handle it thank you But
not until I see some real proof

Lydia appears at the base of the stairs Everyone stops
squabbling looks at her expectantly

LYDIA
They dont want to come down

OTHO
Why not

Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate
hoax He harumphs

LYDIA
I think the reason is they were
trying to scare you and you
didnt get scared --

DELIA
Of course we werent scared
(looking around)
Just a little startled One of
those sushi dropped down my
Kamali

Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-on

BERNARD
(shaking his head)
Total collective hallucination

BERYL
I was a little tipsy

DELIA
This was not a hallucination
people This was real really
totally real

GRACE
Of course they were rather
spectacular effects -- for

Connecticut I mean
OTHO
All presences have a home space
A place where they live so to
speak Where do they hide out

LYDIA
(reluctantly)
The attic
CHARLES

The attic room is locked --

LYDIA
Theyre ghosts They do what
they want

OTHO

Fabulous Otho Fenlocks locked
door ghosts Probably committed
suicide up there -- hanging like
beeves from the rafters Im
totally enchanted

Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door

BERNARD
Delia you are a flake You have
always been a flake Im packing
up and going back to the tricks
of the city That I can manage
If you must frighten people do it
with your sculpture

They exit Delia is horrified and embarrassed

DELIA

INT LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC

the right tone in things like this

Delia pounds on door which opens with an eerie CREAK

INT ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is pushed in first She looks around Delia
Charles and Otho come in next carefully One by one
they straighten up and look around

DELIA
(whisper)
So where are they Lydia

Lydia shrugs looks around

CHARLES
(of fhandedly)
Answer your mother

LYDIA
Listen you guys These ghosts are

them alone Okay

Charles is suddenly transfixed He stares at the model

CHARLES
Its the whole damn town

They gather around Lydia is a little sad as she looks

at
the empty room and the model

OTHO
Look at that detail

DELIA
Look at the tiny figures

CHARLES
Look at all that parking

LYDIA
Come on Leave their stuff alone

OTHO

She shakes her head Otho spots the handbook Palms it

DELIA

gone for good have they
Delia is suddenly out the door urging them all outside

DELIA
Everyone out of there If
theyre in there somewhere I
dont want to scare them away
Come on now stay out of there
Weve got work to do

Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits
Delia carefully closes the door

CAMERA EASES OVER TO the window we see two pairs of
hands white-knuckled gripping the window sill from the
outside

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window CAMERA
EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from the house
They are hanging from a ledge over the inferno

ON INFERNO

Circles of rosy hell Several devilish monsters slaver
up at them hoping for new meat for the furnace Small
geysers spurt foul gases

WINDS BLOW hard rain beats on Adam and Barbara They
struggle to hold on and pull themselves back up and into
the window

INT ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT

Delia

Charles and Otho all start down the stairs

All are holding the hand rail

DELIA
Lydia I will never forgive you
for embarrassing me in front of

my social inferiors You help us

LYDIA
Im sorry already

CHARLES
(fixing on Otho)
Now lets get back to business

town into a leading supernatural

research center and amusement

LYDIA
(disgusted)

I cannot believe this

CHARLES
Delia will cook

CHARLES
Ill bring the wine and the
business plan And Lydia

LYDIA
(frustrated)
I cant bring the ghosts Theyre

CHARLES
Otho could you actually do

something with them

one by
OTHO
(pats handbook
under his coat)
Perhaps if I were properly
motivated

LYDIA
Thats slavery and murder You
dont know these people Theyre
just like you and me Theyre
nice people

THEIR POV

Down the handrail as they walk downstairs Lydia lags
behind sullen

The lower end of the handrail lifts and turns The
handrail has become a long fat diamond-backed SNAKE
-- unlike any we have ever seen It flashes terrifying
teeth and a red-feathered comb It turns and HISSES at
them

ON CHARLES

He stops hand still on rail and stares

ON OTHO

He looks at Charles Then at snake

ON CHARLES

Fear begins to sink in He backs up

ON DELIA

She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail

-- It grips the scaly throbbing dripping body of the
snake

BACK TO SCENE

The snake just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in
the air up the stairs toward them Its tail circles
Delia and spins her like a top When she stops -- the
snake gives her a big wet snake kiss

Snake snaps Otho in the behind It hurts

The three of them fall over each other trying to escape
The SNAKE rears up and spreads a red comb and HISSES
LOUDLY

All three of them turn their backs and huddle on the
stairs

The snake hovers horribly over them grabs Charles in its
coils and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens
then it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs

SNAKE
Weve come for your daughter
Chuck

He leers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over
the bannister Charles screams

The Snake grins at a terrified Lydia

Snake rears back for a strike when suddenly like
thunder one word is heard

BARBARA (0OS)
Betelgeuse Betelgeuse Betelgeuse

The snake looks up with familiar eyes At top of stairs
stands an angry Barbara

What happens next is almost too fast for the eye to see

The snake shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany
handrail

Betelgeuse or his outline whips up the stairs through
the door and is gone like a rocket

BETELGEUSE
Rrratt shit
Otho and Delia rush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified
She runs away
LYDIA
I hate you I cant trust
anybody
BARBARA
No wait

Lydia screams and runs down the stairs
LYDIA
(screams)

I hate all of you

Slowly Barbara returns to the attic
INT ATTIC - NIGHT
Adam and Barbara are wet and exhausted Agitated

ADAM
Great choice weve got here We
get to spend the next century
either hanging out that window
or doing parlor tricks

Adam is working with the model town Barbara is pacing

ADAM
Maybe theyll leave now That
snake was a pretty nasty customer

BARBARA
He might have hurt somebody

ADAM
But he didnt Weve got him
where we want him
ON MODEL

A column of water shoots high in the air

Adam rushes over to the model -- looks down

INT MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire
hydrant He stands nearby hopping mad shakes his
fist at Adam

BETELGEUSE
You pansy-assed cretins How dare

running coulda finished the job

Adams huge thumb comes down and stops the hydrant
Betelgeuse steps defiantly up to it

ON MODEL TOWN

Betelgeuse is ROARING down the street on the BIKE

ADAM

BETELGEUSE
You wish I nearly scored with

ON BARBARA

Angry Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks
Betelgeuse up with the Harley Harley spins and winds
up

Barbara lifts him up toward her squeezing him slightly
BARBARA
You leave her alone you horrid
little prick
CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARAS HAND
Betelgeuse grins Suddenly large spikes shoot out all

over his body piercing the skin of Barbaras palm and
fingers Barbaras blood is a rich pink
She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plummets

EXT MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse parachutes to a soft landing on the town com-
mon The Harley smashes to the ground heavily sinking
in over its tires Betelgeuse is defiant

BETELGEUSE
Go ahead Make my millenium

We hear the tinny strains of HONKY TONK ANGEL as if
from down the street He turns around to follow it

BETELGEUSE
This burg got a cathouse Im
getting anxious if you know what
I mean Six hundred years and

all
He turns the corner to a whorehouse with women -- women
with demon horns -- hanging out of the windows beckoning

Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and swaggers inside

INT ATTIC - DAY
Barbara aghast watching this from above
BARBARA

Adam Why did you build a
whorehouse Have you ever been

He doesnt finish -- a strong WIND BLOWS through the attic

nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over They close
their eyes against the gale

When they open their eyes again theyre no longer in

unusual situation a dead person talking a live person

slowly)

Adammonster is not sure huffs around a little He is
trying to change back into Adam except for his nose
which remains like a beak for a minute Finally it

Lydia and Barbara laugh at him

Suddenly two men push in through the door They push
by Lydia and grab the model They take it out the door

Adam is beside himself Doesnt know what to do
Barbara stops him from taking action

ADAM
What is going on

LYDIA
Really I dont know

Adam looks suspiciously at her

LYDIA
I really dont Ill go find out

She runs out the door

BARBARA
Be careful

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining room

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Lydia walks into a presentation in progress

Sitting around the table are Otho Maxie and Delia
SARAH DEAN is there too She looks around Lydia hoping
for ghosts Sarah is heavily made up smells bad

Lydias photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and
standing on a nearby easel Charles over the model with
a pointer is lost in mid-sentence

CHARLES

-- In short Ive got options to
buy enough of the stores on Main
Street to control the city council
for a hundred years And at the
prices Im talking about if it
all fell apart tomorrow we just
move out and sell to the Arabs and
we still come out Ive talked
to Ed Cornwall about a wax museum
here in Thanksgiving park
Eds the man who made the talking
Jesse Jackson statue And Ive
got a museum dedicated to fifty
great moments in the paranormal --

and parenthetically D-Con wants

the right to start an insect zoo

here in the old hardware store
(seeing Lydia)

Lydia did you finally decide to

join us

They all give her an oily smile

CHARLES
Honey I am just finishing the
first phase presentation about
our little project here Then
well take a stretch and invite
our friends to meet your
friends

Sarah gets Maxies attention and unable to contain her
excitement silently urges him to get on with the ghosts

SARAH
Are they here yet

MAXIE
Yes Charles lets cut the
bullcorn Were here to see
ghosts This whole ghost-town
museum and such-like follows like
a train if youve got the
engine so lets see your
goddamned engine

Everyone looks at Lydia

LYDIA
Theyre not here anymore

CHARLES
(smiling apolo-
getically)
Nonsense everytime she says that
the paint peels and some wild
creature tries to kill us

SARAH
(motioning)
Weve got these pictures Lydia

LYDIA
No really they said they might
come back and all of us could live
in peace if you agreed not to
tease them or make them do silly
tricks

Sarah is disappointed She goes to Maxie Delia takes
over

DELIA
Shes become a little emotional
about all this No counseling up
here But we arent relying on
her No we rely only on
professionals We have Otho

The whole room turns to Otho Who is scribbling something
and mumbling

CHARLES
Are they still here Otho

Otho looks up he missed the question

DELIA
Are they still here Otho

OTHO
Oh theyre still here Theyre
Just not showing up

CHARLES
Theyre probably guilty about what
they did to me

DELIA
Not these people They are
ruthless

MAXIE

I dont care from guilt I just
want to see them

CHARLES
Otho can you do it

OTHO
Its tricky but I think I can do
it

He dramatically produces the handbook

LYDIA
No
Lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts to
another point of view

LYDIA
Wait a minute What am I worried
about Otho you cant even
change a tire

OTHO
(taking the

challenge)
Ill need something personal of
theirs

Lydia smiles confident that the house is stripped of
Maitlands possessions

Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag Lays something
out on the dining room table

DELIA
Im deeply sentimental about
weddings

Lydia stands to see Delia carefully lays out Barbaras
white wedding dress Then next to it Adams wedding
tux

Lydia looks at it A chill runs through her
LYDIA
(hushed realization)
Their wedding clothes
OTHO
(dramatically)
Their wedding clothes
Lydia starts edging for the door

OTHO
Now lock all the doors

Charles and Maxie do it Lydia is getting nervous
LYDIA
(whistling in the
dark)
This is a joke You have got to
be kidding

BARBARA

BARBARA
Come here I want to talk to you
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The group is sitting silently in chairs and on the living
room couch

In the middle of the room the carpet has been rolled

back Otho -- despite his massive bulk -- is on his hands

and knees He has laid out the clothes in a red square

on the floor (He refers to the handbook throughout)
OTHO

Its the shape that will trap them

Hes measuring the string making sure that its even
He holds up the handbook

SARAH

Otho nods

INT ATTIC - NIGHT
Barbara with her arm on his shoulder talks to Adam

BARBARA
Weve been given a gift here

She likes us a lot She needs us
Maybe thats why we died so young
to keep us from getting so
attached to things The house

We didnt have room for anyone

ADAM
(after a long thought)
What makes you think she likes me

Barbara slowly smiles He does too

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is nervous now Otho lights a candle and Delia
turns out the lights

OTHO
As sudden thunder
Pierces night
As magic wonder
Mad affright
Rives asunder

Nothing happens Lydia nervously turns away

LYDIA
(sarcastically)
Doo wah

Then a SIZZLE a TINY CRACKLE along one side of the
square

Stars of five
Bright cotillion
Ravens dive
Nightshades promise

Vari-colored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of
the square A gasp from everyone but Lydia

ON LYDIA

She is looking away She turns to see --

ON DRESS

Barbaras wedding dress floats over the table and fills
slowly painfully with the arms legs and finally the
frightened face of Barbara A lightning bolt flares

Lydia rises slowly to her feet unable to resist
More lightning bolts

OTHO
As sudden thunder
Pierces the night
As magic wonder
Mad affright
Rives asunder

Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara

crepe it wrinkles and nearly collapses

Adam puzzled calls her name silently

DELIA

loving smile She reaches out toward Lydia

Lydia rushes for the door Pulls on it cant open it

Stares down at the model

Barbara and Adams corpses are nearly at the end of their
ropes

ON DEETZES

CHARLES
(turning around
to the model)
Did you hear something

ON MODEL

Betelgeuse begins a bright but sinister carnival barkers
pitch His shoulders now are clearing the model

BETELGEUSE
Welcome to Winter River

Sarah rushes over to the model thinking this is more of
the show Maxie follows

BETELGEUSE
Hel-lo piggies Welcome to Winter
River See the museum of natural
greed The monument to bored
businessmen Come closer Picnic
on the shores of the river of
cheap labor Watch out See the
terrible river monster

Suddenly six squid-like arms push out from his shoulders
and grab Maxie and Sarah She shrieks The arms begin
to rotate like a carnival ride CARNY MUSIC UP

BETELGEUSE
Yowser yowser yowser Exit to the
rear puleeze

Maxie and Sarah are hurled across the room into furniture
They run out screaming Betelgeuse springs out of
the model back to his regular shape
BETELGEUSE
(in style of game
show host)
Yowser yowser Well who do we
have here tonight

He looks up at the suspended Maitlands

BETELGEUSE
Lets have a hand for the
Maitlands Barbara and Adam They
deserve a rest

ON MATTLANDS

Wispy shadows by now still alivedead They fall ina
heap on the floor NOTE They immediately start to
regenerate themselves

BETELGEUSE
Well well get back to them after
they recover from their flight

He turns his attention to the living Suddenly the
PHOTOS of the sheeted Maitlands BURST INTO FLAMES and
disappear

ON ADAM

filling out again he struggles to stand but falls
Barbara shakes her head trying to regain her focus

BETELGEUSE

Look at this mess Look at that
ugly dust

(feeling the wallpaper)
My God what ugly wall dressing
Who is responsible for all this
ugliness

(spying Otho trying

to hide)
Otho its you Watch out for the

He waves and the door opens A little Italian gentleman
appears —-

Otho is horrified Suddenly Othos clothing begins to
rip and fall off as he runs out the door screaming
Betelgeuse laughs with delight Delia pleads with the
recovering Maitlands

DELIA
(frantic)
Please cant you do something
Please

ON BARBARA AND ADAM

Adam not fully recovered heroically tries to speak but
his jaw falls off An exhausted Barbara tries to help
him reattach it

Betelgeuse looks at Delia with an evil grin

BETELGEUSE

(Lawrence Welk-like)
Anda now our lovely champagne
lady To whoma grace and elegance
are as natural as a simple blue
leather couch

(suddenly exploding

like Tweetie Bird)
Do you know how many smurfs died
needlessly to make that couch

(like calling a dog

on her)
Get her Blue

Suddenly Delia tries to run for it But she falls into
the blue leather couch The couch arms swell and grab
her The couch now alive holds her tight bucks her
like a bronco and gallops around the room (as in her
entrance) and out the door

DELIA
Help Help

BETELGEUSE
Shane Shane Come back Shane
(he turns and winks
at Lydia)
Heh heh Hell llo honey

Lydia screams

ON BARBARA
horrified she tries to go to Lydia but falls hard
against the wall

Charles moves protectively toward Lydia who is cowering
in a corner A LOUD ZOOMING is heard from the model
Charles freezes looks down at it

ON MODEL

It shakes as many little CARS ZOOM around in the
streets They have angry little faces ZOOM ZOOM
MED SHOT - CHARLES

He is puzzled

BETELGEUSE (0S)
Look at that Charles

(Recalling Charles earlier speech to Lydia)

BETELGEUSE (0S)
Youre the first trickle ina
couple of years this town will be
filled with people like you and
they will need

CLOSE ON CHARLES

He freezes his eyes big he is sweating and shaking A
serrated yellow stripe rolls up the center of his face

BETELGEUSE (0S)
Lots of parking
ON MODEL

CARS ZOOM off the model and all over Charles parking
like crazy He screams

Charles has turned into a parking structure He is
quickly weighed down with hundreds of the nasty
machines

Two slightly larger cars drive off the model under his
shoes and like skates propel Charles out the door

BETELGEUSE
Okay You can go now youre
full

He laughs hysterically as Charles spins out hollering
BETELGEUSE

I love it when I have a good time
What a guy

(suddenly reflective)
But Betelgeuse is tired of the
fast lane He wants to be a
country boy

(looking around at

the house)
I think Ill settle here I

think
(big and dangerous
grin looks to
Lydia)

Ill get married

Suddenly the room glows red A fire burns on top of the
mantel The WEDDING MARCH PLAYS EERILY An ominous
feeling creeps into the scene

His leering horned whores walk like bridesmaids in
step through the door They rush toward Lydia

Frightened Lydia is assaulted and pulled forward by these
ugly handmaidens she suddenly looks down and sees she is
now clothed in a BLOOD RED WEDDING DRESS LYDIA SCREAMS

BARBARA
No No

Adams eyes widen

LYDIA
(frightened but
hurling the incan-
tation to make him
disappear)
No Betelgeuse Bet

Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydias mouth freezes

A death-masked old PREACHER stands ready to perform the
service He speaks with a hissing death rattle

PREACHER
Do you Betel

His mouth drops and is frozen

BETELGEUSE
Uh uh No one says the B word

PREACHER
Do you ————C take this) woman
to be your wedded wife To
honor
BETELGEUSE
(interrupting)
You betcha

Lydia screams and struggles

PREACHER
And you Do you Lydia take
this man er uh man to

be your lawful wedded husband
In sickness

Lydia struggles Her screams are muffled and distant
Betelgeuse grabs her and shakes her

BETELGEUSE

(eerily speaking

in her voice)
Im Lydia Deetz and Im of sound
mind The man next to me is the
one I want You asked me Im
answering Yes How I love that
man of mine

Adam now fully regenerated moves toward them He
shouts the incantation

ADAM
Beetle

Betelgeuse turns to him and with a sweep of his hand --
Adams teeth (as if they were false) fly out of his
mouth and CLATTER to the floor Adam toothless musters
up his ghost powers and --

TIGHT ON TEETH

They rare back and continue shouting

TEETH
Beetleju

Mayhem breaks out A furious Betelgeuse stomps at them
with his feet The teeth scuttle under the model

BETELGEUSE
(angrily to old man)
Now move it pops

ON ADAM

Speechless Adam heroically charges toward Betelgeuse
ready to strike him Betelgeuse spins on him and waves
his hand Sound of RUSHING WIND Betelgeuse animates
the drapes which reach out and twist around Adam like a
shroud

Adam struggles but the drapes slam him hard against
the wall and spin around him like a cocoon

Adam violently thrashes but is helplessly hanging off
the wall as the drapes keep twisting and tightening
around him

Barbara screams and jumps at Betelgeuse

BARBARA
Beetlejuice

Betelgeuse turns on her eyes flashing

ON BARBARA

A gag comes over her mouth She tears away her face like
tissue paper -- tries to say his name again

BARBARA
Beetlegeuse

ON BETELGEUSE

More angry he waves his hand magically

ON BARBARA

Her lips are zippered shut She angrily rips off that
face

BARBARA
Beetlej

ON BETELGEUSE

As fire darts from his eyes

ON BARBARA

A chromium steel plate is riveted across her mouth She
screams wordlessly behind it

ON BETELGEUSE

He laughs maniacally
THUNDER ROARS

The mood in the room is now fevered and dangerous Adam
is hopelessly fighting to get out of the twisting drapes

Barbara struggling with her mouth she pulls off the
chrome frustrated to the breaking point looks all
around the room screams and rushes to the window and
crashes through into the night

ADAM
(screaming in
anguish)
Barbara

BETELGEUSE
(angry)
Now lets get rolling

PREACHER
Then by the authority vested in
me by

A RUMBLE comes from outside Everyone notices but the
Preacher He stutters to finish the wedding

BETELGEUSE
By me Get on with it

LOUDER NOISE from outside Now nearly DEAFENING

PREACHER
Yes by him I now pronounce

A CRASH at the window

ON WINDOW

Through it amidst a cloud of yellow dust CRASHES

the sandworm Barbara rides him bareback Barbara
struggles to control the ROARING WORM She pulls on his
ears and looks around for Beetle Juice Seeing him she
spurs the worm after Beetle Juice

Beetle Juice struggles trying to run from the worm But
Barbara and the worm outmaneuver him corner him and
when the worm reaches him he opens his hungry mouth and
gulps Betelgeuse in one mouthful

BETELGEUSE
Rrrat shit

Barbara leaps off as the sandworm continues back
through the hole in the wall around the window
WIND HOWLS Lydia runs to Barbara who holds her Adam
staggers up and stares at her with admiration

ADAM

Terrified he scrambles to get out

runs back out on the roof
