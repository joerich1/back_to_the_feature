The THUMP-THUMP oftiny feet We’re at the bottompofa

SLIPPERS excitedly descending -- finding the slippers on the
feet of a sleepy-eyed EIGHT YEAR-OLD BOY with a mop of blonde
hair messily hanging over his brow as he makes his way down --

Into the LIVING ROOM ofa modest flat in a WORKING CLASS
Manchester neighborhood Cramped Homey POOR But our
boy’s face LIGHTS UP Why Well because he’s eight and --

IT’SCHRISTMAS MORNING A heavily ornamented CHRISTMAS TREE
dominates the small room A small pile of PRESENTS at its
base Sitting on the floor is a TWELVE YEAR-OLD BOY with a
WRAPPED BOX labeled “To Liam” in his lap

The eight-year-old is CHARLIE and this is his brother LIAM

YOUNG CHARLIE
It’s here Liam Christmas is

here
Liam shrugs -- DUH-- as he UNWRAPS a TOY ROBOT -- “Voltron --
Defender ofthe Universe” SWEET Gotta love ‘87

On Charlie as he searches the pile for his own PRESENTS But
ALL OF THEM are labeled “To Liam” Young Charlie’s smile
begins to slip away as the search continues futilely

YOUNG CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Where arew my presents

Andas TEARS threaten we hear a soothing FEMALE VOICE

MRS PACE (0S)
Right over there Charlie

YoungCharlie looks up to see his MUM MRS PACE (30s pretty
but tired) entering in a bathrobe She points to AN ALCOVE
where a large OBJECT is covered in BUTCHER PAPER

Young Charlie RUNS over and RIPS off the paper revealing
A gleaming new STAND-UP PIANO with a bench in front of it

YOUNG CHARLIE
(shocked »thrilled)
This is mine

Liam PREOCCUPIED WITH VOLTRON plops onto the couch Mrs
Pace puts her hand on Charlie’s shouldér smiles --

MRS PACE
Yes Charlie Father Christmas

A beat Charlie gapes at the piano -- AWED by this gift

MRS PACE (CONTD)
Youre special love Someday
youre gonna get us out of here
All of us“To a better life

And that tone in her voice PURE BELIEF IN HER SON

MRS PACE (CONT’D)
Now go on Give us a tune dear

Young Charlie walks over to the piano sits at the bench
Hands hovering over the keys TREMBLING with excitement

LIAM (0S)
C’mon baby brotherCan’t save
your family if you don’t play

Something about Liam’s voice sounds ODD Young Charlie
pauses looks overat the couch and does a DOUBLE TAKE

Liam is now in his ADULT FORM Thats right -- it’s the LIAM
we remember from ep 105 The only thing stranger than this
sudden transformation is that LIAM IS WEARING A DIAPER

CHARLIE (0S)
Liam

And the sound of his OWN voice startles him -- suddenly DEEP
He’s GROWN UP Busting out of his child-sized JAMMMIES

MRS PACE
Go on Charlie Play

And just as his hands are about to TOUCH THE KEYS another
voice breaks through Males Older Harsher ANGRY

MR PACE (0S)
Ain’t savin’ no one he is Music
Music’1l never get ye anywhere
Charlie-boy -- you needa trade

Charlie whips around to see an incongruous sight --

A BUTCHER COUNTER is suddenly in the middle of the LIVING
ROOM Charlie’s POV is still that of a kid -- he can only
see as the mid-section of a BURLY MAN in a BUTCHER COAT
But he knows EXACTLY who’s talking --

CHARLIE
Dad

YEP this is Charlie’s FATHER A SHARP MEAT CLEAVER SLAMS
into frame CUTTING through a STACK of PLASTIC BABY DOLLS --

MR PACE (0S)
A trade Cam’t bloody well pay the
bills with music now can we

comfort They seem unfazed by the Butcher of Manchester --

CHOPS CHOP Dad triesto DAMPEN the encouragements of Mum
and Liam CHOP CHOP CHOP

Charlie can’t takeit and does the only thing he knows how --

It’s anelegiac»gospel-tinged BALLAD And he’s a FUCKING
NATURAL the music is HEART-WRENCHINGLY BEAUTIFUL

And NOW WE’RE ON CHARLIE’S HANDS And what we see takes us
WAAAAAYYY BACK To the PILOT Wrapped around his fingers
are his old BANDAGES labeled “FATE”

And now The sound of a BABY CRYING MUFFLED

WIDENING NOW to see that Charlie is NO LONGER in his PJ’s
He’s now in his old druggie uniform (hoodie and jeans) And
guess what He AINT PLAYING in that FLAT ANYMORE -—
EXTBEACH -— DAY - DREAM 2

He’s on the fucking BEACH Seated on the beach at the piano
IN THE SHALLOWS Water laps around him as he HITS A SOUR
NOTE His eyes scan the deserted BEACH -- CONFUSED -- how
the fuck did he get here

And the crying is getting LOUDER Charlie’s face clouds
HOLY FUCK

It’s coming from inside the PIANO

Charlie leaps off the bench -- tries to PRY OPEN THE LID
But it’s STUCK The CRYING INTENSIFIES

CHARLIE

source He stops gazing right at --

THE JUNGLE DARK Wind WHOOSHING through It’s fucking
OMINOUS The WHISPERS intensify CLOSER Are they saying

FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH

CLAIRE strolling -- AARON safely nestled in her bjorn

ON CHARLIE RELIEVED Thank Gods He instinctively begins
to walk towards them -- but he “stops in‘his TRACKS as he
sees --

LOCKE approach Claire with a SEASHELL he just picked up He
dangles it in front of the SMILING BABY Claire LAUGHS
Ain’t this just the»picture of DOMESTIC BLISS

ON CHARLIE Like a jealous boyfriend seeing an ex on a date
HE CAN’T TURN AWAY As Claire and Lock resume their STROLL --

CHARLIE FOLLOWS TRACKING with him he keeps his distance as
he walks parallel at the TREE LINE Just inside the JUNGLE

Now in CHARLIE’S POV Claire suddenly stops And here comes
the crushing BLOW --

Claire takes off the bjorn and offers it to Locke He shakes
his head She insists Finally Locke relents and Claire
straps the bjorn with Aaron to Locke

ON CHARLIE ANGUISHED as he witnesses this bit of intimacy
His heart breaking as he sees himself being REPLACED

ON CLAIRE Sensing Something Is she being watched She
turns toward the camp And sees

NOTHING but trees She turns back to Locke But we STAY ON
the TREE LINE

ARM AROUND one of the TREES to find Charlie hiding OFF

EXT JUNGLE CHARLIE’S HIDEY-HOLE - DAY 5

The eight hidden VIRGIN MARY STATUES Charlie stares at them
for a long beat Then picks one up Holds it in his hand
ON CHARLIE Deeply conflicted An emotional jumble Fear
Frustration Jealousy Pain PAIN that he wants

desperately to SOOTHE

Charlie stares at the statue ashe considers what’s inside
it WHAT IT COULD DOFOR HIM

We know there’s HEROIN in there and because we love Charlie
we want nothing more than for him to put it away A BEAT

Charlie makesa decision He puts the statue back down

HOLD ON the statue lying in the dirt And just as we BREATHE
a SIGH of RELIEF --

CHARLIE’s FOOT FLIES into frame and fucking SMASHES the
statue Charlie’ digs through the shattered remains and pulls
out a small baggie of brown powder

SUPER CLOSE on Charlie’s HAND In his palm -- the BAGGIE of
brown powder And we know what the fuck this is

The fucking HEROIN

OFF CHARLIE holding the heroin in his hand seemingly headed
back down the dark path to addiction -- SMASH TO BLACK

EXT BEACH - CLAIRE’S AREA DAY 6

Claire gently rocks a sleeping Aaron singing SOFTLY to him
CLOSE ON HER as she looks at her child adoringly

Seeing her this way it’s hard to imagine that there was a
time that this woman didn’t want to be a mother

CHARLIE (0S)
Hey

Claire looks up to see Charlie standing right outside the
tent He holds a handful of CLOTHS

CLAIRE
Hi
Charlie extends’ the cloths and we can see he is FIDGETY
CHARLIE

I just I made some nappies for
Aaron this morning

A Moment A FLASH of something from Claire -- oh right
Despite the current climate of awkwardness she still LIKES
this guy She smiles as she takes the nappies from Charlie --

CLAIRE
Thanks

And now a moment of mutual awkwardness Claire picking up on
the same thing we are -- Charlie’s PALE Looks like SHIT
And considering where we left him at the end of the TEASER
We have a pretty good idea of WHY that is

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Are you all right Charlie

CHARLIE

Welltruth be told I’m alittle
off Happens when I don’t sleep
Miss the old routine I guess
Waking up with Aaron in the middle
of the night Changing him

Charlie

And Charlie drops the cutesy shit Looks her right in the
eye says what he came overhere to say --

CHARLIE
I’m sorry Claire For lying I
should’ve told you about that
statue What was in it

A moment She WANTS to believe thiss We glimpse the
tenderness that used to be so common with these two

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I just wish we could go back’ to the
way we were before

And part of Claire does too But --

CLAIRE
There isn’t a “before” Charlie
We were strangers on a plane And
then we became friends and

CHARLIE
And Locke’s your friend now eh

Ouch Real VENOM in his voice there Charlie’s obvious
JEALOUSY instantly snaps Claire back to pragmatic reality --

CLAIRE
Please Charlie For now just
give us some space okay

ON CHARLIE catching himself Realizing what he just said
How pettyyit sounded Wipes his brow of sweat as he does his
best to pretend that this doesn’t hurt like fucking hell --

CHARLIE
Yeah Sure Space You got it

And as Charlie flashes a painfully unconvincing SMILE --

Moving aside the brush Charlie looks at the seven remaining
statues -- LIFTS OUT the one that he CRACKED in half in the
Teaser CLOSE ON HIM as he dips his fingers inside and -

LIFTS OUT THE BAGGIE CLOSE ON CHARLIE - this huge island
and it’s just the two of them right now A man and his DRUG

I’m disappointed in you Charlie

Charlie JUMPS SPINS around to see --

LOCKE emerging from the qungle

CHARLIE
What’re you -- you followed me

But Locke ignores himstrides by Charlie and looks into the
HIDEY-HOLE Sees the STATUES INSIDE His eyes FLASH

( )

LOCKE
How long you beencoming out here

CHARLIE
Look -- John -- you’ve got the
wrong idea man --

LOCKE
You told mewyou destroyedall of
it And yet here it is
(turns to him)
How’s that the wrong idea Charlie

CHARLIE
I’m here to finish the job I’m
getting rid of these damn things

LOCKE
That‘’s very convenient now that I
found them

Locke kneels by the statues and opens his PACK

CHARLIE
Wait -- what’re you doing

LOCKE
There was a time when I let you
choose whether or not you were
going to do this to yourself
(beat)
Now I’m making that choice for you

And with that Locke starts to put the statues in his bag

As proof

CHARLIE
You don’t believe me Give ‘em to
me I’1ll destroy ‘em right now
I’ll throw ‘em in»the soddin’ wind

Charlie opens up the baggie in his hand and

SCATTERS the powder inside everywhere but Locke keeps
PACKING up the STATUES

CHARLIE (CONTD)
John please I know that I lied
but Wait Please WAIT
(Locke stops looks up at
him)
Remember when we) had our our
talks and you You said
everything happens’ for a reason
(MORE )

( ) 27
CHARLIE (CONTD)
That the island tests us That’s
what this is A test My test
That’s why this is here

And if he thinks using Locke’s own words against him will
work He’s dead fucking wrong

LOCKE
It’s here because you put it here
Charlie

Locke PACKS the last one Charlie’s full onPANICKED now --

CHARLIE
What’re you gonna do with them
(Locke ignore him)
Are you gonna tell Claire

Nothing for Lockeas he CLOSES HIS BAG STANDS UP)»-

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
You can’t If she sees those
I’m done She’1ll never trust me
And she has to -- if she doesn’t
(desperate conviction)
It’s about the baby Aaron’s in
danger You have to believe me

Locke studies him And maybe he says this because Charlie
reminds him of a man he once knew A PATHETIC man A manin
a fucking wheelchair But finally --

LOCKE
You’‘ve given up the right to be
believed Charlie

And with that Locke PUSHES past Charlie and walks off
into the JUNGLE

ON CHARLIE Watching him go ON THE VERGE OF LOSING
EVERYTHING And wemight expect him to cry Feel bad for
himself But that’s not what happens at all

No His eyes fill with DETERMINATION An IDEA And
although we have no fucking idea what it is we have the

sense that he sureas shit ain’t gonna let John Locke stand
in his fucking way

CLATRE (CONT’D)
Can I ask you something John

LOCKE
Of course

CLAIRE
Do you think maybe we I mean
me and Aaron That we could stay

in the bedroom In the hatch
Locke steps with the water pouring Looks at Claire

LOCKE
Well pretty loud alarm goes off
every hour and half Not really
the best place for a baby to sleep
through the night

CLAIRE
Right Yeah Of course

Ah She doesn’t feel SAFE Locke offers a reassuring SMILE

LOCKE
How about I move) my stuff down here
for a couple nights Set up right
next to your tent

( )

Thatd be that’d be great

LOCKE
Then consider it done

She smiles Turns to go But stops herself --

CLAIRE
John D’you know anything about
baptism

LOCKE

Not a whole lot
(smiles)

Why do you ask

CLAIRE
Charlie» he came by my tent and
he was
(here it is)
He told me the baby needed to be
baptized That he was in danger

Locke just shakes his head casts a Ssidewards glance at his
BAG with statues --

LOCKE
My understanding is that baptism is
about making ‘sure children get into
heaven should anything happen
Call it “spiritual insurance”

Locke SMILES but it’s clear Claire is still WORRIED He
sees)this puts an affectionate hand on her shoulder

LOCKE (CONTD)
There isn’t any danger Claire
(and then)
Charlie feels he has to save the
baby because he can’t save himself
Hmmmm Wise words And speaking of Charlie

And Charlie SNAPS as his pent-up RAGE AND JEALOUSY finally
finds a target --

CHARLIE

person he cares most about And then --

He feels the stares -- everyone’s watching him Hurley

looking at him with utter disgust

It’s too much for Charlie -- TEARS WELL in his eyes as he
realizes the futility of what he’s doing Locke is now at
his side Staring at him intently

Charlie stares right back at Locke -This is the moment of
truth and he now understands He has no choice

Charlie SLOWLY hands Aaron over to Locke
Locke wraps his arms around the baby turns his back on

Charlie and wades up to shore He hands the baby back to
Claire She grabs Aaron in total relief

THE SUN RISES on another day

Charlie sits alone on the beach Bruises on his face
surround a ysmall GASH on his lowerforehead

Jack approaches with a bagof medical supplies and sits down
Without saying a word he pulls out a THREADED NEEDLE and
some ALCOHOL Holds it to Charlie’s face

JACK
You need stitches

Charlie nods vacantly Jack proceeds to work on his wound

JACK (CONT’D)
Try to be still

As Jack threads the first stitch Charlie winces but accepts
the pain A beat then --

CHARLIE

JACK

didn’t believe
Jack cuts him off --

JACK

do anything like this again

Charlie looksJack in the eye He knows what everyone thinks
of him right now And if nothing else he wants to set the
record straight on one matter

CHARLIE
I’m not using Jack I know that’s
what it looks like and that’s what
everybody thinks God did I
want to but Djdidn’t
(softly »needing this)
You have to believe me

( )

37

The sincerity in his voice is heart wrenching and we know
HE’S TELLING THE TRUTH Hesreally didn’t use

JACK
That’s not what I asked Charlie

Whatever absolution Charlie was hoping for he now sees it
ain’t gonna come easy So he says the only thing he can -

CHARLIE
It won’t happen again

Jack nods And as he continues stitching the wound in
silence

EXT JUNGLE - WOODED AREA - MORNING 38

The scene of the fire It’s out But the earth ius scorched
WE FIND Eko pacing the area Taking it all in Is he
assessing the damage or is there another purpose for his
inquisitive stare Before we can dwell on that question too
long Claire approaches with Aaron in her arms

CLAIRE
Charlie told me you’re a priest

MR EKO
(beat )
Yes

Claire takes this in A beat She’s clearly UNCOMFORTABLE

CLAIRE
He said you told him I needed to
MR« EKO
I did not tell Charlie to do what
he did
CLAIRE

I know I but

(just spits it out)
Do you think the baby needs to be
baptized

Eko looks at Claire for a long moment

MR EKO
Do you know what baptism is

CLAIRE
It’s what gets you into heaven

( )

38 38

MR EKO
(smiles shakes his head)
Who told you that

Claire refuses to give up the source Just shrugs

MR EKO (CONT“D)

It’s said that the day John The
Baptist baptized Jesus the sky
opened up and a dove flew down from
the sky This told John something
That he had cleansed this man of
all his sin He had freed him

(smiles knowingly)
Heaven came much later

Claire takes in this bit of information and she is
suddenly overcome with EMOTION

MR EKO (CONT’D)
What’s wrong

She shakes her head embarrassed to say this To feel it --

CLATRE
I was never baptized

And now she looks up EYES WATERING finally getting to what
she really came here to ask

CLAIRE (CONTD)
So if you If you did it for
Aaron -- does that mean that if
If something happens to us
(beat tears coming)
We wouldn’t be together

Oh Wow THIS IS THE CORE OF CLAIRE’S WORRIES Eko smiles
kindly And then --
