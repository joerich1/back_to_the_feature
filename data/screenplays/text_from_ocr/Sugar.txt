Miguel hands Rudy the ball and Rudy demonstrates how to handle
a knuckle curve ball which looks strangely unorthodox with the
index finger tucked against the baseball

RUDY
Spike curve Gives you more rotation
more movement
(hands Miguel the ball)
You try

Miguel struggles to emulate Rudys grip so Rudy maneuvers his
fingers into the correct position Alvarez laughs

ALVAREZ
Vamos Lets go Pitch it

Miguel looks over to his catcher Jose Winds up the next
pitch and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark

Rudy and Alvarez laugh Miguel looks back over his shoulder

RUDY

stares at them hard as they go He turns back to his catcher
determined squeezes the ball in spike curve formation
Delivers

Jorge whispers in one of the girls ears and the two of them
begin dancing with him and Miguel At first cautious Miguel
and his partner ease closer until Miguels hands are on her
hips leading her in rhythm to the hip-hop jam while mixing in
some Latin moves as well

As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners several
local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork
But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in
particular who

wanders over gets in Miguels face

JACKASS
(barely audible)
Careful Paco This aint the jungle

Miguel stares him down A few clubbers in the immediate
vicinity stop dancing observe Jorge steps between them
and

apparently drunken egos speak the same language everywhere
because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in
their native tongues Both seem to be understanding the other
though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific

Brad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything
serious starts They all hustle out to

bedroom where Helens silhouetted figure lingers in the window
He tiptoes inside

The sound of a CHURCH CHOIR fades in and carries over to

grace
