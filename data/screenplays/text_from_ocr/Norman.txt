NORMAN

THE MODERATE RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF A NEW YORK FIXER

by

Joseph Cedar
EXT CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING 2
It is still dark outside
The CNN clock over Columbus Circle shows 525am

NORMAN OPPENHEIMER is standing next to a bench i
Central Park He has EARPHONES in both ears In his hand we
notice a METAL BUSINESS CARD HOLDER

At this hour it is either fitness fanatics or true
workaholics who need to be in the office by 7am exercising
in the park Norman is watching these fanatics pass by

INT STARBUCKS - DAY 3

A shot of a PEN writing on a PAPER NAPKIN It is a diagram
with lines and circles that loosely follows the names
numbers and institutions as we hear them

NORMAN (0S
This is the idea the Israeli
government is million dof about
three hundred million dollars of
tax receivables from the
Palestinian Authority My idea is
to find someone here someone like
Jo Wilf or an Arthur Taub who
would buy that debt Pay the
Palestinians eighty or ninety cents
on the dollar assuming that the
Palestinians will take what they
can get at this point and that the
Israeli government would have no
choice but to honor their debt to
an American financial institution

We see PHILIP COHEN listening to Norman in a crowded
Starbucks with a polite but very skeptical look on his face

NORMAN (CONTD)

(passing the napkin to

Philip
Everybody wins The Palestinians
get their money Israel isn’t
making any political concessions
and lets say it is Wilf - he
collects thirty or forty million or
worst case scenario - Just the
interest for that debt

PHILIP
Why would the Palestinians agree to
get less than the full amount

NORMAN
Because it is better than getting
nothing

Philip thinks about this for a moment

( )

PHILIP
That is actually a pretty good
idea
NORMAN

It is I’ve thought it through I
just need someone who can do it
(pointing at Wilf’s name
on the napkin)
Isn’t this the scale of the kind of
deals Wilf is looking for

EXT CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING 4

A tight shot of Norman in Central Park smiling recalling
this conversation with Philip There isa strange excitement
in his expression He pulls the earphones out of his ears
Then back to

INT STARBUCKS - DAY 5

PHILIP
Yes butI don’t know if he would
get involved in a political
situation like this I mean I
know he wouldn’t

NORMAN
All Iwantto do is present it to
him I really think it serves
everyone When something is good
it’s good This is good

PHILIP
I don’t have direct contact with
Wilf You know that right

NORMAN
But you have friends there Don’t
you This is your circle

Philip has to consider this for a moment

NORMAN (CONT’D)
If you’re not comfortable doing
this I’1ll understand I can ask a
few other people I know But I
wanted to show it to you first

PHILIP
Bill Kavish Do you know him He
works for Wilf He is a friend
Have you heard his name

NORMAN
Yeah Maybe Why do I know that
name
EXT CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING

Back to Norman

KAVISH We follow Bill FROM NORMANS POV

stops by a tree to stretch his muscles

One of the runners he sees is BILL

as he finishes his run and

We focus in on Bill’s energized face as we continue to hear

PHILIP (VO)
You know his family His father was
Henry Kavish You remember him He
was a fund-raiser for Ort in the
Eighties He got into some kind of
trouble They caught him ogact ly
some money I don’t know exact
what happened there but they flrea
him his wife left him his kid
turned their backs on him He died
alone and penniless Bill is his
youngest son

Norman is fixated on Bill’s face his movement

with genuine human interest

scar his father left on him

studying him

as if looking for the emotional

Norman has taken out one of his BUSINESS CARDS holding it
between his fingers

INT STARBUCKS - DAY

Back to Philip and Norman

NORMAN
Can you introduce me to Bill

PHILIP
I havent spoken to him in a long
time

NORMAN
There is nothing to lose If he is
not interested hell say he is not
interested But if he is You
never know

PHILIP
I can give you Bill’s e-mail but
Id prefer not to send a formal
introduction We represent clients
who do business with them I
don’t want to be in a position
where I’m asking him for a favor

NORMAN
Youre doing him a favor But
okay That’s fine Can I say we are
related Can I say I’m your uncle

( )
7

PHILIP
No Don’t make it a family thing
It doesn’t sound good It might
not be a good idea to mention my
name

Norman clearly needs more than that And Philip has to give
him something

PHILIP (CONTD)
You can say you know me But please
don’t tell him you got his address
from me

Norman nods his head with polite gratitude Philip senses his
distress as he gets up to leave

PHILIP (CONTD)
I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful
It’s tough You’re like a drowning
Man waving at an ocean-liner How
do you get it to see you Jo Wilf
is an ocean-liner He doesn’t see
any of us

NORMAN
But I’m a good swimmer Don’t
forget that As long as my head is
above water I know how to tread

With a pat on Norman’s back Philip leaves

EXT CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING 8

Were back at the park where Bill still stretching notices
Norman staring at him Norman raises his hand in an innocent
friendly gesture

Bill has no idea who he is He nods his head and continues
stretching a bit suspicious of the friendly stranger

Norman approaches him handing him his BUSINESS CARD

NORMAN
Good morning Bill Norman
Oppenheimer
BILL
What the fuck You’re stalking me
now
NORMAN

I only need a few minutes of your
time I know you are busy Philip
Cohen might have mentioned me

BILL
No Excuse me This is ty private
time please respect that Call
the office

( )

NORMAN
I’m in touch with your secretar
twice a day Very nice lady bu
You don’t return my calls What am
I supposed to do

BILL
Let it go Give up Does Philip
know you’re here How did you even
find me

NORMAN
It’s a good business opportunity
Why should I let it go I wouldn’t
be here if it wasn’t time
sensitive Just give me a minute to
explain A very igh official I
can’t mention his name right now
came to me with an offer to sell
his country’s tax receivables to a
third party

Bill can’t believe he’s in this situation He looks at Norman
as if he is a crazy man

NORMAN (CONTD)
Eighty cents on the dollar

BILL
I’m sorry I have to leave
Excuse me This is unacceptable

NORMAN

(as Bill walks awa
Bill I wouldn’t be doing this if I
didn’t think it is worth Jo’s time
Don’t trust me trust Philip
Sometimes good things come in
surprising ways You never
know You never know right
Worse comes to worse he kicks me
out the door

(turning around)
No - worse comes to worse he kicks
ME out the door It’s my job to
keep people like you away Don’t
you get that Please respect my
position Stop Just stop I’m
sorry But I don’t know what else
to say

Bill waits to see if Norman is internalizing the finality of
his response

NORMAN
So I’1l tell my partners we had a
good conversation and we’ll see
what happens Okay

Bill shakes his head with disbelief and walks away

( )

NORMAN (CONTD)
Thank you Bill

EXT 57TH ST AND 7TH AVE - DAY 9

Norman is standing across the street from a DINER called
BROOKLYN DINER at the floor of a huge office building

He is looking through the windows of the diner at Bill
Kavish now dressed in his business suit sitting with a few
other businessmen in one of the booths The man in the center
of this Breakfast gathering is JO WILF authoritative
calm allowing the younger men around him £6 do all the
talking

Norman pulls out his phone and dials
NORMAN
I got a meeting
INT PHILIP’S OFFICE - SAME TIME 10

PHILIP
With Jo Wilf
Right before Norman answers Bill Kavish raises his eyes and
catches Norman’s glance standing outside Bill give hima
viciously protective 100k

NORMAN
Better With Arthur Taub

We sense that Philip doesn’t believe Norman
PHILIP
If Jo Wilf is an ocean- liner

Arthur is a nuclear submarine
How did you manage that

NORMAN
(walking away )
I told you I’m a good swimmer

Our view expands to see Norman walking away and blending into
the Midtown bustle This image gradually goes out of focus

TITLE NORMAN

THE MODERATE RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF A NEW YORK FIXER

OMITTED 11

INT BARCLAYS MANHATTAN HEADQUARTERS- MORNING 12
Norman walks into this vast intimidating lobby

He approaches a reception desk underneath a sign that reads
“Barclays Oil and Gas Exploration Conference”

Norman causally stands in line with a few other business
people waiting to register

INT CONFERENCE AUDITORIUM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 13

Norman has a name-tag over his chest pocket It reads NORMAN
OPPENHEIMER

He wanders into a medium size auditorium in the middle of a
panel discussion quietly finding a seat in the back of the
room

THE ROOM IS FULL OF BANKERS AND FINANCE EXECUTIVES From a
distance Norman blends in but a closer look at how he is
dressed exposes that he clearly does not belong

On stage with a backdrop of images of massive oil drilling
rigs there is a MODERATOR and a GUEST SPEAKER--

RON MAOR a minister in the Israeli Parliament

They are discussing geopolitics and the energy market but
our focus is Norman’s POV scanning the room

He is hunting for something focusing on different
individuals men and women their name-tags their Laptop ps
gadgets briefcases shoes different items that catch his
attention While in the BG--

RON MAOR

(heavy Israeli accent)
I told the American leadership at
a very high level probably more
than half a year ago Go to the
Russians They hold the keys They
know the commanders of these units
of chemical warfare on a first name
basis Some of them are married to
Russian women The most effective
way to protect this potentially
dangerous arsenal is by getting
into contact with the Russians But
it should be a real contact without
a drop of arrogance Understanding
in advance that okay America lead
in Iraq Europe lead in Libya now
ask the Russians to lead and accept
the fact that they will have a role
in resolving this conflict

MODERATOR
Suppose someone says you can’t
trust them

(MORE)

( )

13
MODERATOR (CONTD)
You would say it is not a matter of
trust but of national interest

Norman has fished a MIKE AND IKE candy out of his coat
pocket He sucks on it without calling attention to himself

MAOR
There is clearly a problem it
relates to the Chinese and the Far
East as well It is a major
question in the next decade for all
the other allies around the Pacific
Rim Is America pushing Russia away
from the West and into the arms of
China Some natural gas experts in
this room will say that is exactly
whatthey’re doing by encouraging a
pipeline between Israel and Turkey
Inevitably you will have a
symbiotic relationship with China
based on currency trade
whatever But as I always say
when dealing with global interests
we shouldn’t be playing backgammon
shesh-besh you know Where you
roll the dice and hope for the
best We should be playing chess

As this is going on Norman has locked his glance on

MICHA ESHEL

He is in his mid 40s handsome well dressed He is sitting
in the front row near the door with an expression that is
saying that he has heard all this before and that he is not
very impressed with Mr Maor on stage

INT OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM - LATER 14
A buffet lunch is being served The ATTENDEES are mingling

Maor is the center of the room everyone is trying to get a
word with him

But there is a SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE greeting Eshel as well
on the other side of the room

It is as if these two important men Eshel and Maor while
polite to each other and perfectly pleasant are actually on
apposing teams

Norman is following this dynamic very carefully noticing how
they elegantly avoid eye contact with each other

At a certain point Maor is escorted out of the room by his
security guards and entourage

Eshel watches Maor leave While Norman is watching Eshel

INT AUDITORIUM - LATER 15
The room is now three-quarters empty
In this panel Micha Eshel is the main attraction

He speaks with much less pathos and with considerable humor
and ease THE FEW PEOPLE that stayed to hear him seem to
enjoy his sarcasm Norman is sitting in the back listening

ESHEL

The distinguished minister speaking
before me who I have a great deal
of respect for seems to know a lot
about everything and it is hard to
argue with him god forbid I’m
not saying he is wrong China
Russia America He must know
what he is talking about He is my
boss after all And a very good
chess player

(slightest smile Audience

laughs)
But you know George Bernard Shaw
once said - some people see the

way things are and ask why

I see how things should be and ask -

why not Mr Maor is very good at

describing the world as it is If

you ask me I think our job is to
iscuss how the world should be

INT BARCLAYS MANHATTAN HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - LATER 16

Eshel is accepting compliments from the few people who are
walking with him toward the exit

Norman is tailing behind

He follows Eshel out the doors watching him as he says
goodbye to all the people around him - surprisingly
remaining all alone on the Midtown sidewalk without any
entourage or security Eshel puts on his sunglasses takes
in the busy street as if deciding where to go then heads
Uptown

Norman peels off his name-tag from his jacket and follows
Eshel

EXT OUTSIDE BARCLAYS HEADQUARTERS- CONTINUOUS 17

Eshel stops at a traffic light Norman is close behind him

EXT CHOCOLATIER ON MADISON AVE - DAY 18

Eshel has entered a gourmet chocolate store

( )

18

Norman carefully peeks into the store window to see Eshel
casually sampling chocolate

Norman considers going inside but there is something
intimate in the way Eshel is savoring the chocolate that
Norman knows would embarrass Eshel if interrupted

So Norman waits outside as Eshel moves over to the cashier
with a bag of MILK CHOCOLATE COVERED CASHEWS

Norman quickly ducks out of Eshel’s eye-line

INT MEN’S CLOTHING BOUTIQUE NYC - DAY 19

From inside the shop and its exquisitely designed display
window we see out toward Madison Ave

Different Upper East Side types cross the window

Then Eshel stops by the window He looks inside at a pair of
BEAUTIFUL CALFSKIN SHOES set on a pedestal The shoes are the
centerpiece of the window display

He is munching out of a his BAG OF CHOCOLATES
Then we see NORMAN walk by the shop

Norman looks at Eshel for a moment making believe he is
recognizing him for the first time

Eshel turns around Norman introduces himself They shake
hands They talk for a bit They are referring to something
in the display window

Norman is laughing So is Eshel

They stop laughing and continue conversing about something
both of them seem to agree on

Eshel offers Norman a chocolate from his bag Norman firmly
declines Then Norman opens the door to the shop and allows
Eshel to enter before him Only now do we hear them mid
conversation

NORMAN
--l’d be a teey to introduce you to
him Let me tell Arthur you are in
town I’m going to his dinner
tonight You can join me

ESHEL
How do you know Arthur Taub

NORMAN
My wife used to baby-sit him Then
e ended up working for him years
later They were very close
(pulling out his cell
phone)
(MORE )

( )

19
NORMAN (CONTD)
Let me tell him youre here I’m
sure he would be happy if you came
tonight

Eshel examines Norman’s face His clothing His hair There
is something about his appearance that makes Eshel want to
think this over

ESHEL
Hold on a second Put the phone
back

Norman puts the phone back in his pocket THE SALES PERSON
who has been waiting for an opening in their conversation
greets the two gentlemen

SALES PERSON
Good Morning Welcome to Lanvin My
name is Jacques

ESHEL
We are just looking around for now
Thank you

JACQUES

I am very happy to assist you
today Come inside

Mr Eshel is “speaking at a very
special event later this week and
has a series of meetings with
business leaders and diplomats He
would like to try on the shoes in
the window

Jacques puts his hand under his chin and looks at Eshel
taking in the clothing he is currently wearing and hi
general style

Eshel humors him by posing with his hands folded under his
chest

JACQUES
May I ask what line of business you
are in

ESHEL

I don’t want to ruin my good first
impression but I am a politician

NORMAN
This is Mr Micha Eshel He is the
minister of trade and labor in
Israel and deputy to the prime
minister

ESHEL
No I’m the deputy minister of
trade and labor

(MORE)

( )

19 19
ESHEL (CONTD)
My boss the minister is a deputy
to the prime minister but there
are three other deputies just to
put things in context

JACQUES
It is an honor to meet you Sir
I’m sorry but you looked too young
to be so important

ESHEL
Thank you for the very flattering
lie You have a future in
politics which is more than I
can say for myself I might be
young but I’m already washed up
I’m just kidding Very nice to meet
you Jacques

JACQUES
§sincerely
You don’t look washed up

ESHEL
Thank you That’s because I’m in
New York now New York makes me
feel good Back home I look tired

NORMAN
No you don’t I’ve seen your
appearances on TV You look great

ESHEL
That is because I’m very
photogenic

NORMAN
No you are one of the few Israeli
politicians who radiates optimism

ESHEL
Optimism The shoes I buy today
will last longer than the
government I serve in

NORMAN
Change is good That’s what I was
told

JACQUES

The fashion world relies on change
ESHEL

And the Middle East relies on - how

do you say stagnatzia

NORMAN
Stagnation

( )

ESHEL
Stagnation Once you’re in power
you don’t want anything to Change
You can ask my boss about that

NORMAN
Do you think he’1l become prime
minister

ESHEL
Maor If he does It’ll be a joke

NORMAN
What about you Would you ever
consider running

ESHEL

Me

(eating a chocolate)
You know what the problem with
modern leadership is To be a real
leader you need to have a firm
idealogy you have to really know
what is right and never look to
the sides

(illustrating with his

hand)
Straight But in order to get
elected you need to be the
opposite of all that That’s the
tricky part

Something telts 1 me that you can do
both I think you would be a great
candidate

ESHEL
Only magicians can do two things at
the same time
(to Jacques)
So what do you say

JACQUES
The event you are attending It
is in the evening yes

ESHEL
Yes But I think people will be
coming straight from work I don’t
think they’re getting dressed up
especially for this

NORMAN
Of course they are It’s not black
tie but this is going to be a
classy crowd It’s at the Waldorf
Astoria

( )

19 19

Eshel has cagually picked up a shoe to see the price We see
it as well 104

NORMAN (CONTD)
(to Jacques)
The press will be there too

ESHEL
(returning the shoe)
Forget the shoes Nobody is going
to be looking at my shoes Maybe
can I see your ties

He walks over to the tie display

NORMAN
What size shoe are you A ten
Eleven Just try them on We’re
already here

ESHEL
No I’m not getting shoes now
(picking up a beautiful

NORMAN
(handing the shoe to
Jacques )
Well try these on for Mr Eshel

Jacques walks over to one of the racks looking for
something

JACQUES
I think I have a better idea May 1
take some measurements Mr Eshel

ESHEL

No Really I don’t want to take up
your time Thank you How much is
this tie

Norman moves in closer to Eshel taking the tie from his
hand

NORMAN
Let’s see what he comes up with
Don’t say no before you try it on
(reassuring him with eye
contact)
Don’t worry Trust me Enjoy it
Let him do his job

JACQUES
A young minister should not feel
washed up Excuse me for saying
Please I can help with this Let
me try something

Eshel thinks about this for a brief moment then playfully
submits himself to Jacques’ tape measure

( )

19

Norman in the meantime sneaks a peek at the price tag on
the tie 195

INT MEN’S CLOTHING BOUTIQUE NYC - DAY - LATER 20

Eshel is now standing with his back to a set of THREE
MIRRORS He is dressed in a new elegant suit shirt and tie

He looks and more importantly - FEELS amazing It is not too
flashy it does not call too much attention to itself but it
does give him a uniqueness that Eshel can feel even without
seeing himself

Norman is reflected in all 3 mirrors smiling
Jacques is kneeling by Eshel’s feet fixing his cuff

ESHEL
(to Norman)
So you said your wife works for
Arthur Taub

NORMAN
Used to work for him yes She
passed away

ESHEL
I’m sorry

NORMAN
This was years ago But she was
very close to Arthur and I would be
more than happy if you joined me
tonight He is someone you should
meet

ESHEL
I’ve been hearing his name from a
few different people recently He’s
young right What’s he like

NORMAN

(expertly)
There are two kinds of moguls One
kind is like a big ocean-liner
ship they make a lot of waves and
noise everybody can see them from
miles away Like Jo Wilf I think
Minister Maor is in his close
circle of friends

Eshel takes note of that last point

NORMAN (CONTD)
And then there is Arthur who is
more like a nuclear submarine
Quiet Fast Young And extremely
sophisticated

( )

ESHEL
Interesting

NORMAN
He’s an interesting fellow He
likes to surround himself with
consultants who are in influential
political positions but with an eye
on the future He has good
instincts about these things And
he is very good about compensating
his consultants You’d enjoy
meeting him

Eshel takes this in

ESHEL
Maybe Ill have my office contact
him We’ll see I’m not a private
person you know Not yet
anyway

NORMAN
Of course But if you need my help
reaching him y to do it
Even if “it is just to plant a
seed

ESHEL
Thank you

NORMAN
Where are you staying while you are
here How can I reach you

We sense Eshel doesn’t want to answer that question He looks

over at Norman again trying to evaluate him

Jacques at this point has helped him slip ona
surprisingly simple looking s
to them and ordinary laces

ESHEL
Can I look at myself yet

JACQUES
Please Mr Eshel you can turn
around now

air of

oes with a metallic brown tone

Eshel turns around to look at himself He is speechless

The 3 mirrors create a triptych with the reflections of Eshel

and Norman in his background

Eshel looking carefully at his reflected image tries a
facial expression that is contemplative and serious Then he
fills his lungs with air creating a more authoritative

impression

Norman and Jacques are watching Eshel transform into what he

always imagined he could be

( )

CONTINUE

But then

Then at

D

Eshel looks down at the price tag on the suit
jacket We see it as well 6750

the shirt price tag 635

Eshel takes off the jacket as if it were on fire and hands it
to the surprised Jacques

He then

ESHEL
Please take all this away from me
before I get used to it You are
right it does make me feel
fabulous but there is one rule
every Israeli politician learns in
the beginning of his career you
cannot wear a suit that costs more
than an ordinary man’s car
Israelis don’t want to see their
representatives enjoying
themselves That is a fact I’m
sorry for wasting your time

ORMAN
But what if you didn’t know how
much it costs

ESHEL
I do It is too late
NORMAN
to Jacques)
Could Mr Eshel perhaps borrow the
suit for his event

JACQUES
I can ask We do that occasionally
with celebrities and red carpets

ESHEL
No I’m notborrowing it I don’t
want to feel like Cinderella for
one night I’m not a model Ima
member of parliament

NORMAN
Then keep the shoes

ESHEL
(handing the shoes to
Jacques

No Enough I don’t want them

Norman takes the shoes from Jacques

NORMAN
Please Let me bu ou these shoes
It would be my pprivitese to buy
them for you it makes an
Israeli leader feel good that is
the least I can do

takes off the shoes and pulls off his pants

( )

ESHEL
No Thank you But no I can’t

NORMAN
(kneeling by Eshel with
the shoes)
Would you at least put them on one
more time Go ahead Just put your
feet inside before you say no

Eshel looks at Jacques then at Norman and finally slips his
Ld

feet back
underwear

Jacques

into the shoes Eshel is now in his shir

tie

socks and - metallic brown dress shoes He loves
these shoes Norman pulls out his CREDIT CARD and gives it to

NORMAN (CONTD)
Were taking them I don’t want you
walking out of here empty handed

ESHEL
(intercepting the card)
I can’t let you pay If I take the
shoes I have to pay for them

NORMAN
It’s an expense for me I write it
off Don’t argue I want to do
it

ESHEL
The truth is I can’t put that kind
of expense on my credit card

NORMAN
You don’t have to I got it

Norman pushes Eshel’s hand away nods to Jacques who takes a
moment to confirm the transaction before he steps into a side

room with

the credit card

ESHEL
Yeah You sure

NORMAN
Yes Positive Don’t worry I’m
happy to do it

Eshel is looking down at Norman’s worn-out 40

ESHEL
What about you Why don’t you buy a
pair for yourself They really are
Magical shoes

NORMAN
Me No I need special orthopedic
shoes I have a very wide foot
pont ask I’ve got problematic
eet

shoes

( )

20

Jacques returns with the card and pen on a tray together with
the receipt

Norman blushes with surprise when he looks at the receipt
before he signs it We see the amount 1137 (including tax)

Norman picks up the pen to sign but right before he does he
stops to look at Eshel who is putting on his old cloths

ESHEL
Is everything okay

Norman signs the receipt Places the pen down with a dramatic
effect

NORMAN
Everything is perfect Enjoy

JACQUES
Would you like to wear them out
Mr Eshel or should I put them’ in
a box for’ you

ESHEL
Please ut them in a box Thank
you 1 save them for the right

ecasion

He hands the shoes to Norman as if Norman were his assistant
Norman hands the shoes over to Jacques to wrap in a box

ESHEL (CONTD)

Jesus I just realized I’m terribly
late I must run now Thank you
very much

(then to Norman)
I don’t know what to say Thank you
for this I’m glad I bumped into
you

NORMAN
My pleasure

ESHEL
(joking)
I should have taken the tie too

NORMAN
Next time

ESHEL
Next time
(then
Here take the chocolates They’re
delicious

NORMAN

I have severe nut allergies One
wrong bite and I can drop dead

( )

20 20

ESHEL
ulling the bag awa
Oh erry Specifically x shews

NORMAN
No Peanuts But this is the one
area I don’t take any risks Thank
you for offering

ESHEL
(holding up a chocolate)
This can really kill you What
happens if you take a bite

NO
If it has even the smallest trace
of a peanut my body mistakes it
for a dangerous substance and
immediately shuts itself down My
skin reacts My eyes tear My nose
starts running and my throat
swells so that I can’t breathe

Norman pulls out an EPIPEN injector from his pocket

NORMAN (CONT’D)
If I don’t inject myself with one
of these I can be dead in less
than fifteen minutes

Eshel is impressed by this description

He pops the chocolate he was holding into his mouth and
carefully places the bag of chocolates on the counter next to
Jacques away from Norman

Jacques nods with gratitude
Eshel walks toward the exit of the fitting room

NORMAN (CONT’D)
What about Arthur Would you like
to meet him Can I tell him you’1l
be coming with me tonight

Eshel thinks about this for a moment Finally--

ESHEL
Sure Why not It would be great to
meet him I just need to check my
schedule I’m staying at the
Warwick Leave a message for me
there with the details
Thank you Norman

NORMAN
Norman Oppenheimer

Eshel walks back in hands Norman his BUSINESS CARD and taps
him on his shoulder in a friendly way

( )

20

ESHEL
Here Take this It has my private
number in back No matter what
when you are in Israel Norman
Oppenheimer if you ever need
anything feel free to call

Norman pulls out his card holder and takes out his own
business card and hands it to Eshel

NORMAN
And this is me When you are in New
York if there is anything I can
help with anything at al please
let me know And 1711 call you
later

ESHEL
(reading off Norman’s
card)
Oppenheimer Strategies

Eshel puts the card inside the shoe box

On his way out with his Shopping bag he grabs a few final
chocolates from the bag he left on the counter

Norman and Jacques watch him as he blends into Madison Ave

Norman looks down at the card in his hand We see it has the
official symbol of the state of Israel

It reads “MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY TRADE AND LABOR MICHA
ESHEL DEPUTY MINISTER” And on the other side handwritten
Eshel’s PRIVATE CELL PHONE NUMBER

EXT MADISON AVE - EVENING 21
Norman is walking and talking on the phone

NORMAN

Norman stops walking Distressed

answer until you speak with Arthur-

obviously better--One seat is
enough More than enough See what

Norman hangs up pulls out Eshel’s business card and dials

INT ESHEL’S HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - SAME TIME 22

ESHEL’S PHONE RINGS just ashe enters his suite He looks at
the number on the screen places the phone on a table by the
door and heads toward the luxurious tub in the bathroom

We stay on the phone while it continues to ring and Eshel
gets the water running in the tub
EXT ON NORMAN MADISON AVE - SAME TIME 23

Norman gives up dials another number After a moment

NORMAN
Yes Hi Can you connect me to Mr
Eshel’s room --So can I leave

him a message

INT ESHEL’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT - LATER 24

Eshel in a robe AND WEARING HIS NEW SHOES is speaking on
the phone With

INT BEDROOM JERUSALEM APARTMENT - NIGHT - ISRAEL 25

It is seven hours ahead and DUBY (60s) Eshel’s lawyer a
small man with intense eyes and a no-nonsense demeanor is
in bed picking up a pen and note-pad from his night- -table
THEY SPEAK HEBREW

DUBY
(as he writes down the
name Norman Op enheimer )
Did he say what he does

ESHEL
He’s a businessman He has some
kind of investment fund Not sure I
understood exactly A warm Jew

Duby is quietly stepping out of his bedroom so not to wake
his wife taking the pad with him

DUBY

You want to meet Arthur Taub but
not through this guy Norman

( )

25

ESHEL
I have nothing better to do
tonight why not join him

DUBY
You can’t walk in there with
someone you just met and know
nothing about These things are
important If you want to meet
Arthur let me set up a proper
meeting

ESHEL
Are you sure It seems harmless

Duby by now is by his laptop searching for NORMAN
OPPENHEIMER Random faces come Ups but none of them are
Norman The further down he scrolls the more pictures of
ROBERT OPPENHEIMER and images of ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS fill the
screen

DUBY
I’m sure One hundred percent sure

Eshel has walked out onto the terrace of the suite
ESHEL

I hear Taub is like some kind of -
nuclear submarine

DUBY
Listen to me We don’t even know
what this event is all about I

don’t want you walking into an
uncomfortable situation Go see a
movie Go have a good meal Should
I reserve a table for you at a nice
place

ESHEL
I’1l find something to do Forget
it Any press on my visit here so
far

Duby is now looking at a NEWS WEBSITE on his computer screen
with a picture of RON MAOR in a photo-opp in NY with
important US officials

DUBY
No Nothing special It’s better
this way

ESHEL

It’s crazy to see how they suck up
everything Maor says I’m telling
ou he is a dangerous man He
iterally believes his own
bullshit As if he is running the
entire world

Duby is sensing the poison spreading in Eshel’s veins and
knows he needs to change the subject

( )

25

DUBY
(searching the web for
entertainment options)
Do you want to see a show tonight
What do you feel like doing

ESHEL
---l don’t understand how people
take him seriously Can’t they see
he is as dumb as a shoe

DUBY
I’m getting you tickets for a show

ESHEL
No show I’m not in the mood for a
show I’1l go get something to eat
Don’t worry about me
DUBY
Okay Put it on your hotel bill
They’re paying for it And do mea
favor - stay away from the
Normans I’m serious
Duby disappears we stay on Eshel
He sits down on the sofa in his suite He is restless

His phone RINGS He realizes it is Norman He is tempted to
answer but as per Duby’s instructions - he doesn’t

Instead he picks up the remote control and turns on the TV
as the phone continues to RING

INT EXT UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT - SAME TIME 26
Norman hangs up his phone

He is waiting by the entrance as INVITEES pass him on their
way into a grand Upper East Side townhouse

He steps out to the street corner but no sign of Eshel

He takes out his phone again We see the screen He is
calling - “Eshel Private Cell” It rings and rings

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT 27

Eshel is sitting alone in a booth in a very expensive gourmet
restaurant sipping WINE and enjoying a beautifully displayed
dish of oysters His phone is BUZZING He ignores it

INT UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 28

Norman has now blended into the mingling guests

( )

28

We see ARTHUR TAUB the nuclear submarine He is
greeting his guests

Arthur notices Norman from the corner of his eye
Norman casually picks up a hors doeuvre from a passing
e

waiter while nods his head toward Arthur

INT TOWNHOUSE DINING AREA - NIGHT 29

Norman has walked up to the second level of the house

He examines the hors doeuvre in his hand - it looks like a
stuffed fig with an unidentified nut topping - Norman smells
it

Knowing he can’t eat it he places it on a mantel behind a
decorative statue

Then he peeks through the large doors leading into the formal
dining room From Norman’s POV we see a long fancy dinner
table with approximately 20 settings Next to each setting
there is a name card

Norman walks in going over the name cards until he locates
the card that says MICAH ESHEL It is a proud moment for him -
to have literally secured (by proxy) a seat at the table

He pulls out his phone and dials again “Eshel private cell”

He takes a deep troubled breath as he realizes that Eshel is
not picking up
INT TOWNHOUSE DINING AREA - LATER 30

The guests are now entering the dining area finding their
seats around the table

Norman is already sitting comfortably by the table on the
seat marked for Micha Eshel

He smiles nonchalantly at the guests as they take their seats
around him

Arthur who is talking to a few people on the other side of
the room notices Norman sitting by the table

He whispers something into the ear of A WOMAN standing next
to him She is Arthurs assistant

The smiling assistant approaches Norman She leans down so
that she is very close to his ear

ARTHUR’S ASSISTANT
(very quietly
Mr Taub would like to speak with
you Do you mind joining me

( )

30

NORMAN
Of course Thank you
(to the couple sitting
next to him)
Excuse me

Norman and Arthur’s (smiling) assistant step out and
disappear into a corridor

OMITTED 31

INT INDOOR BASKETBALL COURT TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The assistant leaves Norman waiting in this indoor basketball
court which apparently serves as Arthurs kids own all
purpose playroom Norman looks around taking in the
extravagant setting He has his business card ready in his
hand Arthur enters

ARTHUR
Mr Oppenheimer

NORMAN
Norman We met at the Stern
auction My wife is friendly with
Lili BY the ways I can’t thank you
enough for the last minute
invitation for Eshel

ARTHUR
Where is he Mr Eshel

NORMAN
He’s on his way I just spoke to
him He apologizes He was held u
in a meeting at the UN But he is
on this way

ARTHUR
You just spoke to him now

NORMAN
Yes A few minutes ago

Arthur is evaluating Norman He seems amused rather than
angry

ARTHUR
How do you know Mr Eshel

NORMAN
I’ve been helping him out with some
of his American alliances There
are some very interesting ideas he
is trying to promote For
instance I’m sure ou’ve heard of
the tax money Israel is withholding
now

(MORE )

( )

32 32
NORMAN (CONT D
He has this genius idea for a third
party tobuy those tax
receivables

ARTHUR
(cutting him off)
And just so that I understand
Mr Eshel asked you to ask me if he
can come tonight

NORMAN
I told him about some of the work
youve been doing with the cancer
research fund in Israel and other
initiatives you support and he was
very excited to meet you yes

ARTHUR
You realize that this is an
intimate dinner for a group of
people who get together for a very
Specific purpose right And
t at this is my house My private
ome

NORMAN
It is a beautiful home

ARTHUR
You can’t just walk in and sit at
my table I was happy to include
Mr Eshel even though I found it a
bit odd that he would invite
himself to a dinner through someone
I don’t actually know But if he is
not here the invitation is not up
for grabs You understand that
right

As they are Speaking Norman notices Arthur’s assistant
returning with Norman’s COAT and HAT over her arm

NORMAN
He should be here any moment

ARTHUR
Well then why don’t you wait for
him outside and when he arrives I
promise you we will make him feel
very comfortable

NORMAN

You want me to wait outside
ARTHUR

Please
NORMAN

Okay « That’s fine I’m sure he will
ere any minute Thank you
Arthur

( )

32

Arthur is not sure what to make of Norman He gives him one
last look before he turns around and leaves

Once alone with Norman Arthurs assistant’s smile
disappears She opens and service door leading to the back
yard

Norman takes his coat and hat thanks the assistant with a
head gesture then leaves

EXT UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 33

Norman deflated is sitting on a bench opposite the
townhouse

He is emptying the last candy out of his box of Mike and
Ikes chewing on them obsessively and scratching his collar
bone

From his POV through the large windows of the townhouse we
see Arthur and his guests enjoying their privileged dinner

Norman rips apart the Gandy box to make sure it is really
empty then gets up and walks away into the dark park

EXT A SYNAGOGUE ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT - LATER 34
This is an old Upper West Side building

Norman comes walking down the block He stops by the
synagogue and presses his face against the glass door

He tries the door It is opened

INT SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS 35

We hear a CHOIR and a CANTOR echoing in the foyer Norman
steps into the main sanctuary following the music
INT SYNAGOGUE - MAIN SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS 36

A CANTOR and his CHOIR are rehearsing a cantorial piece in
this modest in size but beautiful old New York synagogue

The cantor acknowledges Norman with a slight head-nod as he
continues the rehearsal

Norman steps out and enters a small kitchenette off the main
sanctuary
INT KITCHENETTE - CONTINUOUS 37

Norman hungry finds a box of Ritz crackers on the counter
and a bottle of ginger ale

( )

He takes a fist-full of crackers and pours himself a paper
cup full of ginger ale He opens the refrigerator and pulls
out a JAR OF PICKLED HERRING

Just as he is about to place a piece of herring

on a cracker

he hears rapid footsteps descending down a staircase Norman
quickly returns the cracker box and the jar to where they

were

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
the stairwell

energy of someone on speed

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Norman Oppenheimer If you came to
hear my class you’re a little
late

NORMAN
If I had the time If I only had
the time

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Youre busy That’s good Someone
has to make sure the world out
there is still spinning What’s
new Who’s winning Who’s losing
Tell me something exciting

NORMAN
I just got back from a very special
evening Fascinating people
(casually)
At Arthur Taub’s house

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
You were in Arthur Taub’s house

NORMAN
I brought Micha Eshel with me I
should introduce you to him You
know who he is right

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Say the name again

NORMAN
Micha Eshel He’s in the Israeli
parliament Young Charismatic
sharp Very sharp
elping him out a bit
showing him the ropes I’m going to
help him raise some money

a 50 year-old beardless rabbi emerges from
noticing Norman on his way out He has the

We sense Rabbi Blumenthal is skeptical of Norman’s name-
dropping but he plays along so not to offend him

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Good for you He is a lucky man to
have you on his side

( )

37

NORMAN
I’m the ducky one Believe me this
guy - he’s the real thing He’s an
incredible human being

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Maybe bring him to us as a guest
lecturer If you say he’s good

NORMAN
Next time he is here We’ll make an
evening out of it

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Sounds like a plan Norman

Rabbi Blumenthal looks at Norman He doesn’t believe a word
he just heard but going along with it is easier than
confronting Norman

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT’D)
I’m going to head home You
staying

NORMAN
(referring to the cantor
in the background)
it relaxes me I’1l listen for a
it

Rabbi Blumenthal nods his head and leaves Norman alone in the
kitchenette

Norman takes a handful of crackers before he exits--

INT MAIN SANCTUARY - NIGHT 38

Norman quietly sits down on one of the benches and listens to
THE CHOIR AND CANTOR REHEARSE

The entire wall in front of him is covered with MEMORIAL
PLAQUES Hundreds of names engraved in bronze sheets on the
wall

Norman pulls out his phone and looks down at the screen
scrolling down his contact list waiting hoping his phone
will ring But it doesn’t

He looks up One name plaque in particular catches Norman’s
attention We close in on it HENRY KAVISH

INT ESHEL’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 39

WITH THE CANTORIAL HARMONY STILL UNDER THE SCENE

Eshel is alone in his hotel room He is drunk after a whole
bottle of wine all to himself

( )

39

He collapses onto his bed and sees the SHOEBOX from Lanvin
He opens the box Pulls out a SHOE He stares at it with
admiration He notices Norman’s business card

EXT OUTSIDE THE SYNAGOGUE - NIGHT - SAME TIME 40
Norman’s phone RINGS

He looks at the screen his face lights up “Eshel Private
Cell”

Norman had just stepped out of the synagogue but when he
tries to reenter e doors are now locked

Before Norman answers the call he walks around the building

into a narrow service alley where there are decorative
windows into the main sanctuary and rows of garbage cans

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 41
Norman finds a spot takes a deep breath--

NORMAN
Hello Sir

INT EXT ALLEY - SHARED WITH - ESHEL’S HOTEL SUITE 42

The two men are now SUPERIMPOSED on the screen Eshel lying
on his back holding the shoe up in front of his face Norman
in the alley by the garbage cans

The CHOIR CAN STILL BE HEARD It annotates the scene

ESHEL
Is it too late to call

NORMAN
No Not at all I just got back
from Arthur’s dinner

ESHEL
I’m sorry I couldn’t make it It
was a crazy day I’m really sorry

NORMAN
That’s okay No need to apologize
Well find another opportunity I
told Arthur all about you

ESHEL
I feel terrible Do you forgive me

Norman pauses on this As if it is the first time in his life
anyone asked him that question

( )

NORMAN

Please don’t give

thought

ESHEL
Yeah You sure

NORMAN

Positive

ESHEL

I want you to know how much I

Eshel passes out
The CHOIR FADES OUT

NORMAN
Mr Eshel

Norman stays on the line listening to Eshel’s heavy
breathing

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE THREE YEARS LATER
OVER THE BLACK SCREEN WE HEAR 43
ANNOUNCER

It is my great honor to welcome the
prime minister of the state of
Israel-- Micha Eshel

A ROAR OF APPLAUSE AND ECSTATIC CHEERING takes us into -

INT WASHINGTON CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT 44
This is a ballroom the size of a football field

THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMAN are on their feet applauding and
cheering

We see the stage It is the annual AIPAC convention in
Washington

A single official speaking podium is set in the center of
the vast somewhat futuristically designed stage

A MUSICAL INTRODUCTION (with pathos at the level of the Star
Wars theme) is playing on the PA accompanying the entrance
of Micha Eshel waving smiling overwhelmed by this IMPERIAL
welcoming

ESHEL
Thank you Thank you Thank you
Thank you very much Thank you
Thank you Thank you Michael Thank
you Thank you all Thank you
Thank you

But the applause won’t stop Eshel absorbs it in Allowing
the love to flow

Our camera closes in on his unavoidable smirk then slowly
moves down his body and stops on his - METALLIC BROWN SHOES

Way way back far from the stage Norman Oppenheimer is in
the audience applauding with the masses his name tag
dangling around his neck

( )

44

He is standing so far away from the stage Eshel is too small
for Norman to see his face

So Normanhas his head directed at one of the large screens
in the ballroom projecting Eshel’s exuberant face

Norman is in tears Tears of genuine excitement

INT HALL IN CONVENTION CENTER - LATER 45

A long line of MEN and WOMEN has formed around a highly
guarded reception area where Eshel and other VIPs are shaking
hands and greeting each other

Norman is looking at Eshel from a distance From his POV we
see Duby Eshel’s lawyer who is now his chief of staff

And HANNA curly hair nice smile and energetic eyes

They are standing behind Eshel with cell phones in their
hands whispering to each other and occasionally into Eshel’s
ear monitoring the people who get to approach the new prime
minister

Philip Cohen approaches Norman He has a plate of PECAN PIE
WITH WHIPPED CREAM in his hand Together they continue to
look at Eshel from a distance

NORMAN
For once I bet on the right horse
What were the odds It is a
miracle

PHILIP
Have you spoken to him yet I mean
since he won

NORMAN
Weve been exchanging messages
It’s not that simple to reach him
anymore He’s got a lot on his
plate

PHILIP

And from now on I mean how
does it work Are you friends How
close are you Do you get to visit
him in his office When he comes to
the States does he invite you to
have breakfast with him at Blair
House

NORMAN
To tell you the truth I don’t
know From my side I want him to
know that I’m here for him if he
needs me

( )

45

Philip looks at Norman trying to evaluate how sincere he is
Norman ap ppears to be not only sincere - but truly moved by
the magnitude of this event

PHILIP
Can you introduce me to him

Norman looks at the long line of people waiting for their
turn with Eshel

NORMAN
Of course But let’s wait for the
right moment I don’t want to push
myself on him

PHILIP
If you don’t go up to him he won’t
know youre here

Norman is hesitant

PHILIP (CONT’ D)
Look at him He is sealed off very
few people have access to him’ now
that he is King For all you know
he may never return your calls or
worse - he may never even receive
your messages

NORMAN
Nonsense Micha is a friend

PHILIP
Micha There is no more Micha
There is prime minister Eshel and
he has millions of friends You
need to get on that line

Norman knows Philip is right

INT HALL IN CONVENTION CENTER - LATER 46

With AT LEAST TWENTY PEOPLE ahead of them Norman and Philip
are standing on line to meet Eshel

From Norman’s POV we hear bits and pieces of the conversation
around Eshel and see visual fragments of these very quick and
awkward encounters

We jump cut from one encounter to the next emphasizing the
repetitiveness

One of the people introduced is--

DUBY
Jo Wilf needs no introduction

ESHEL

Mr Wilf It is good to finally
meet you

( )

46

Jo Wilf the ocean-liner receives a warm hand shake
from Eshel but then he is ushered away just like the rest

Norman follows him as he is pushed out of the inner circle
noticing how protective Duby is of Eshel’s space

As Norman and Philip move up in line we also get a sense for
how this works Hanna spots the person next in line together
with another AIDE she verifies their identity then she
whispers the info into Duby’s ear

Hanna is the friendly one Duby is protective and suspicious

We close in on Norman He is only 4 or 5 people away from
meeting Eshel and he is suddenly very nervous about what
might happen

DUBY (08
Pastor Kermit Little founder of
Christians Assembly for Israel

ESHEL (0S
Pastor I’m honored you are here
We’ll be seeing each other tomorrow
night right
Norman catches Hanna’s glance

She smiles at him but it doesn’t seem like she has any idea
who he is

She looks down at her lists Turns a few pages Nothing

Duby’s suspicious intimidating eyes also fall on Norman for
a brief second

Norman fixes his NAME TAG so that it is in clear view

Philip looks over at Norman Norman is doing his best to
project ease But Philip senses his distress

PHILIP
Everything okay

NORMAN
Yes Fine I might be reacting to
something in the room But I’m
okay

The aide standing next to Hanna is going through her lists as
well finally finding what she was looking for

Norman sees her whisper something into Hanna’s ear who
whispers something into Duby’s ear who looks up directly at
Norman

On the sound-track - background ambiance disappears

Norman is as helpless and pale as a condemned man about to
hear his verdict Then he hears--

( )

DUBY
Norman Oppenheimer from New
York

Eshel turns to face Norman

A beat

There is definite favorable recognition Eshel’s face breaks

into a huge and warm smile
Sound-track back to normal

ESHEL

Norman My friend Where have you

been I’ve been trying to reach
you

Norman finally can breathe again allowing Eshel to pull him

in for a warm and meaningful embrace

Secret service agents aides photographers all seem to
close in on Norman but not in a threatening way - they are

all smiling at him

Including Jo Wilf who is watching Norman with a curious look

on his face

All but Duby - who is not smiling and still seems very

suspicious of Norman

ESHEL (CONTD)
(to Duby and Hanna)
You know Norman right

They all shake hands

ESHEL (CONTD)
Naomi Come meet Norman
Oppenheimer Norman this is my
ife Naomi

They shake hands

ESHEL (CONTD)
Norman is going to be my special
honorary ambassador to New York
Jewry My personal special

advisor
DUBY
He is
NORMAN
I am
ESHEL

Yes Of course Look around you
Look around

( )

46

We look around - THE ROOM HAS ENERGY HUNDREDS OF FACES NAME-
TAGS BUSINESS CARDS CHANGING HANDS MEN AND WOMEN IN
VIBRANT LOUD PRESSING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS

ESHEL (CONT’D
There are over five hundred
organizations represented in this
room It is a tremendous force of
nature Tremendous Unprecedented
in our history We need to
understand how this incredible
force unites around the issues that
are important for the Jewish
people and the world

Duby can relax Another empty meaningless promise
But it is enough to impress Philip And confuse Norman

FLASH Their picture is taken against the backdrop of the two
flags

The next people in line are ushered up to Eshel and Norman
is prepared to move aside but Eshel won’t let go of Norman’s
arm

DUBY
Congressman Bob Love from Georgia

ESHEL
Tom good to see you Do you know
Norman Oppenheimer

BOB LOVE
No I don’t Nice to meet you
Norman This is my wife Joyce

Norman finally shakes off his initial daze

NORMAN
Nice to meet you Congressman Mrs
Love

Philip leans in reminding Norman of his presence

NORMAN (CONTD)
This is my nephew Philip Cohen I
think he is the youngest partner at
Frankle Zell Gould and Rudoff in
New York Right

PHILIP
Very nice to meet you One of the
youngest

NORMAN
(pulling him in closer)

I’m sorry st didn’t introduce

ESHEL

NORMAN
Toby is married to a Solomon Beth
She is Charlie Solomons
daughter

DUBY
More importantly Sir Gavin
Solomon’s granddaughter I
mentioned him to you the other day

ESHEL
(to Bob Love)
This Toby you heard of Smile Bars
The candy bars Amazing story

AS THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES-- Our camera gradually moves
up and away from the commotion around Eshel Norman is in the
center of it shaking hands laughing talking accepting
business cards

From a high angle it all appears like a busy BEEHIVE
Hundreds of people buzzing around the room maneuvering
toward the center

The camera stops high above the room with this intricate
dynamic human pattern filling our entire frame illustrating
the elaborate network that is being formed in front of our
eyes --FREEZE

WITHIN THE FREEZE

On Norman looking around him - he sees a forest of human
encounters frozen in time

Just as great composers create perfect harmonies in their
mind as world-class chess players can plan 50 moves ahead -
so Norman’s genius comes into play in this room at this
moment He sees how it all connects

Norman examines the different frozen interactions

--He sees Arthur (nuclear submarine) Taub He examines his
cocky face without any spite or resentment only a satisfied
smile that says - I have arrived

He also sees Arthur’s (still smiling) assistant

--Then he looks over at BILL KAVISH standing next to JO
WILF Bill has a strained smile and drops of sweat on his
forehead

( )

--Then Norman sees Rabbi Blumenthal trying to push his way

into a cluster of people but seems to be bloc

aggressive socialites

ed out by more

--And Philip right behind Norman next to Eshel in his
element mid-conversation radiant with charisma

Norman pulls out of his pocket his BUSINESS CARDS HOLDER

He extracts one and feels it with his fingers like one feels

quality silk

INT EXT TAXI - NIGHT

with a big smile on his face on his way to Union Station We

BRUCE PARISH
(candidly)

If the goal is achieved by
speaking privately well
speak privately N Not
everything has to be public
Is ere not a certain
humility or restraint the
Jewish leaders should
exercise when real lives hang
in the balance

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Without a building without

comedy set in Israel

PHILIP
That Rabbi you spoke with
Blumenthal is he friendly

wit Nicole’s conversion

BARBARA KLEIN
Start Up State doesn’t have an
address That is the point It’s in
people’s minds It’s abstract

And together with Barbara Klein everyone in the room joins

in-

EVERYONE

Here take my card Call me

Norman takes itall in He is drunk but not from alcohol

He has never felt this safe

or at home in his life

The last image in this series of FLASHES from Norman’s POV
is a shot of Eshel being escorted out of the room by a dense

herd of aides and security

Eshel turns his head and gives Norman one last look

There is longing in Norman’s eyes as he watches Eshel

disappear

INT TAXI - NIGHT

Back in the cab The NIGERIAN DRIVER looks back at Norman

with a friendly smile

Norman is going over the tens of BUSINESS CARDS he collected

over the evening

EXT UNION STATION WASHINGTON DC- NIGHT 50

Norman’s cab stops my the main entrance Norman gets out of

the cab and enters the

station

INT TRAIN - NIGHT

ALEXANDRA (ALEX) GREEN (30s) is entering the train car still
at the platform of Union Station She takes off her coat as

she finds a seat by the aisle

There is an AIPAC NAME TAG still hanging around her neck

under her coat

Once she sits down we notice Norman entering the car He
sees her name tag and smiles at her sitting across the aisle

from her

NORMAN
Norman Oppenheimer Nice to meet
you
(reading off her name tag)
Alex Green

ALEX
Nice to meet you too I guess we
can take these off now

They both remove their name tags Alex pulls out her iPad

but before she can turn it on--

NORMAN

organizations

NORMAN

Alex shakes her head no she does not know him

NORMAN (CONTD)

Alex shakes her head Norman senses her coldness so he lets
go

As passengers continue to enter the train walking through
the isle between them--

NORMAN (CONTD)
Wait Green Any connection to
Julian Green From Basel

Alex shakes her head again

The last PASSENGER has entered the car He stops right
between them and indicates to Alex that he would like the
seat next to her

Alex gets up to allow him to get in

NORMAN (CONTD)
(moving over in his seat)
You are welcome to sit here If
youre busy I won’t bother you
Don’t worry

Alex looks up at the seat situation in the car The last
travelers are finding their seats filling up most of the
car She doesn’t really have a civil way to refuse so she
collects her stuff and sits next to Norman

ALEX
Thank you

As she turns on her iPad--
NORMAN

HOUSE - NIGHT 52

Hanna Naomi and other AIDES AND STAFF together
egular GROUP OF SECRET SERVICE MEN enter one of
drawing rooms still swarming with JOURNALISTS

EMBASSY STAFF AND OTHER GUESTS

The offici

alceremonial part of the day is over and Eshel is

in a playful jet-lagged mood

Eshel lift

ESHEL
Everybody Go home Go to sleep
Leave me alone The historical bond
between the United States and
Israel has never been stronger you
can all relax At least til
tomorrow morning Right Duby

DUBY
(smiling)
The “special relationship” is
intact
ESHEL

That’s right The “special
relationship” And

s his hand as if he is conducting a choir
ESHEL DUBY AND EVERYBODY ELSE

The “unwavering commitment to
Israel’s security”

ESHEL
Yafe The unwavering commitment
Now please leave me alone Get

some sleep If I have to shake one
more hand tonight my fingers will
fall off

( )

52

Eshel allows himself to fall into one of the sofas in the
room He loosens his tie and kicks off his SHOES

With Hanna’s encouragement most of the people exit the room

But there is one tall slim MAN in his 60s waiting patiently
in the corner of the room who is not leaving His name is
BRUCE SCHWARTZ

DUBY
(to Eshel)
One more hand to shake I’m afraid
Youve met Bruce Schwartz before
havent you Special Middle East
Coordina

Bruce comes over and sits in one of the chairs opposite
Eshel

BRUCE
Just over the phone Good to
finally meet in person prime
minister We don’t have to shake
hands

ESHEL
That is very considerate of you

They shake hands anyway

ESHEL (CONTD)
You’re not going to make me put on
my shoes are you

BRUCE
No This is as informal as could
be

ESHEL

Good The formal me needs a rest

DUBY
Bruce would like to go over some
points before tomorrows meeting
with the president

Bruce leans in Duby and Hanna lean in too to Bruce’s
surprise

BRUCE
It is less about your meeting with
the president and more about the
statements you will deliver
elsewhere in town As somebody who
occupies a fairly tough job
himself the president is always
sympathetic to foreign leaders
dealing with complicated internal
politics

( )

52 52

ESHEL
Let me stop you Excuse me Ani lo
tzarich et hahartzaah hazot

Duby on instinct is about to interfere but Eshel signals
him to remain out of it

ESHEL (CONTD)
Please tell the president that I am
here to say ‘yes’ to peace I’m
sorry - “state of peace” as we
agreed to call it I fully accept
his vision I understand it and I
believe in it No internal politics
will change my commitment to the
Wye document

Duby Hanna and Bruce are all surprised by how firm Eshel
sounds Surprised and relieved

Eshel gets up to grab a handful of CHOCOLATE COVERED NUTS out
of a bowl on one of the tables --

ESHEL (CONTD)
This evening I had to Duby how
do you say mas sefataim

DUBY
To pay lip service

ESHEL
I had to pay lip service to a few
organizations on a few minor
issues but I promise you it has no
substance

BRUCE
I’m sure the president will

ESHEL
(cutting Bruce off
sitting across from him)

You know what I’ve found out in the
last couple of weeks since I was
elected It is very strange
because it is the opposite of what
I thought I would feel Maybe the
president can identify with me
For the first time in my
professional life I have no
olitical worries This is true I
on’t care if I’m reelected

Somehow God put me in this job It
is not that I didn’t work very hard
to get here I did but hundreds of
other potential leaders worked and
campaigned just as hard as I did
and for some reason I’m the one
sitting in this chair today The
top spot I’ve reached the top of
the ladder

( )

52 52

Eshel picks up a SMALL FLAG that was placed on the table
gets up for more chocolate

ESHEL (CONTD)
Why me And not someone else Who
knows Believe me I’m as surprised
as everyone else But this is the
interesting thing - instead of
feeling the burden of that great
responsibility I’m feeling
Duby iech omrim goral

DUBY
Fate

ESHEL
I feel Fate which weighs
nothing at all If God put me here
he must have had a good reason I’m
not free to run away from this job
but to be honest - no single human
being can really claim to be big
enough for this job either

Hanna and Duby exchange a glance

DUBY
(to Bruce)
I would be happy to go over our
itinerary with you so that we can
discuss the sensitivities of each
group

ESHEL
(to Bruce cutting Duby)
What is it that really worries the
president Tell me I want to know
What doesn’t he want me to say

BRUCE
Well you have been saying
différent things in different
forums I think we are trying to
get abetter understanding of the
singular message you wish to
deliver

ESHEL
You were there tonight right
Hanna how many completely opposing
organization leaders came up to me
and said - we’re behind you You
have our support to stand your
ground How many 50 100 Each
with a completely different agenda
There is no such thing as a
faite vo message And anyone who
tel you he has a singular message
is probably teaching at a
university or writing a blog

( )

BRUCE
I didn’t mean it that way I’m
sorry if

ESHEL
(cutting Bruce)

I’1l tell you what my singular
message is I’m going to end this
conflict How I’m going to sa
‘yes’ to compromise to EVERYBODY
Because the opposite of compromise
is not idealism The opposite of
compromise is not integrity The
opposite of compromise is
fanaticism and death LIFE is
compromise I not only believe in
that That is who I am That is why
I’m here in this position If it
works I will go down in history as
the leader who ended this epic
conflict If I’m wrong and BY
compromise leads to another bloody
war - I will blame God for giving
me a role I was incapable of
performing

Eshel’s confused monologue (only a notch below Dr
Strangelove level) is a result of extreme fatigue and the

high level

of adrenaline his body has been releasing all

night But now he is done Eshel pops the last chocolate
covered nut into his mouth picks up his SHOES and walks

out

Bruce Duby and Hanna have gone from pleasant surprise in the
beginning of his monologue to complete shock at the end

INT TRAIN

- NIGHT 53

Back to Norman and Alex The train is in motion The lights
have been dimmed

NORMAN
So can I ask you what kind of
stuff do you deal with

ALEX
(covering her iPad)
There is what’s called a mutual
legal assistance treaty between
Israel and the United States We
have our hands full

NORMAN
I can imagine Like what kind of
things Commerce agreements

ALEX
No that is a different de artment
We are an arm of the Israeli
justice ministry in the United
States

(MORE )

( )

ALEX (CONTD)
We coordinate criminal
investigations judicial procedure
extradition

NORMAN
So if an Israeli criminal flees to
America you’ re in charge of
bringing him back

ALEX
We would be involved in that yes

NORMAN
Or if an American criminal tries to
hide out in Israel

ALEX
Yes that too

NORMAN
Wow So do you have any interesting
stories for me Like with all those
Russian oligarchs who are wanted
allover the world and ask for
asylum in Israel Tell me how that
works from the inside

Alex shakes her head Her lips are sealed

ALEX
Sorry

NORMAN
Do you know Carol Raskin If I’m
not mistaken she wrote some of
these international treaties She’s
a good friend of mine Do you know
Carol

ALEX
Not personally no but I know who
she is

NORMAN
Id be happy to introduce you

ALEX
That’s not necessary I wouldn’t
want to bother her But thank you

She is a solid brick wall leaving Norman no entrance point

Alex looks at her watch Then at Norman who has no reading
material

and doesn’t seem like he plans on sleeping

She pulls out a pair of EARPHONES from her bag As she
inserts one into her ear - Norman catches a quick glimpse at
a SIMPLE GOLD WEDDING BAND on Alex’s finger

NORMAN
Family Kids

( )

53

She pulls out the earphone

ALEX
I’m sorry What
NO
Do you have a family Kids
ALEX
A partner
NORMAN

Youre a lesbian

Alex laughs Finally

ALEX
Yes I am
NORMAN
Good for you That’s terrific
ALEX
What is
NORMAN

I like it when people know what
they want It’s a good thing To be
focused You know I have a close
friend a fascinating man named
rabbi professor Nathaniel Lewis
he teaches at JTS He has a
daughter who started a Jewish
lesbian organization Abigail
Lewis Do you know her

Alex shakes her head

NORMAN (CONTD)
You should meet her You’1ll love
her I can get you two together

ALEX
That is the third time in five
minutes that you offered to
introduce me to someone Why are
you trying to get me to meet
people Do I look lonely

Norman looks at her for a long moment

NORMAN
What do you mean

ALEX
Why do you feel that I need these
introductions Have I given you
that impression That I’m looking
for connections

Norman shakes his head

( )

53 53

NORMAN
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to offend
you I just thought it made sense
And maybe it is good for Abigail
too to meet someone at the Israeli
consulate But maybe I’m wrong

He turns away to face the window

ALEX
I didn’t mean that as criticism I
apologize if it came out that way

NORMAN
Then what are you saying I don’t
understand

ALEX
Never mind I appreciate you trying
to help connect me it is just that
I don’t need connections right now

NORMAN
So what do you need

ALEX
What do I need

NORMAN
Yeah I’m sitting next to you on
the train we were both at the
convention together how can I help
you Im offering my assistance
I’m a good person to know Take
advantage of that What do you
need I’1l help you get it

Alex sincerely thinks this over for a moment but comes up
with --

ALEX
I don’t need anything

NORMAN
Impossible Everybody needs
something Even tough lesbian
lawyers

ALEX
I need many things but not
necessarily things you can help
with

NORMAN
Try me

ALEX

I need the satisfaction of knowing
that Im doing good in the world

( )

NORMAN
(scratching his ear)
That’s a big one

They both smile
NORMAN (CONTD)
Your parents - they’re proud of
you

ALEX
I think so I hope so

NORMAN
They should be

Alex sees that Norman means it and accepts his complement

ALEX
What about you Family Kids

ORMAN
A daughter just finished graduate
schoo Her mother died when she
was three

ALEX

sorry to hear that You raised your
t

daughter alone

NORMAN
I did my best yes

ALEX
That must have been difficult

NORMAN
Youknow whatthey say - small
children small problems

ALEX

And why were you at the convention

I noticed you were speaking with
the prime minister You know him
well

Norman hesitates for a brief moment before he

NORMAN
Yes I do Micah is a close friend
ALE

How did you meet him

NORMAN
I bought him a pair of shoes

ALEX
You bought him a pair of shoes

responds Then--

( )

NORMAN
(in a sweet folkie melody)
You never know You never know
You never know

Miraculously Alex is now completely captivated by Norman

ALEX
What do you mean you bought him a
pair of shoes

NORMAN
You never know A pair of shoes
The most expensive shoes in all of
New York but the best investment I
made in my life

Norman pauses From here on the scene is shot in extreme
close-ups accentuating every tiny careful move they make
like bomb disposal experts picking a path through a

minefield

ALEX
May I ask what you do for a living

NORMAN
I’m a businessman

ALEX
What sort of business

NORMAN
Consulting Mostly

ALEX
You work in a consulting firm

NORMAN
Firm No It is basically only me
these days

ALEX
Who do you consult

NORMAN
Businesses Organizations
Individuals It varies Sometimes I
consult other consultants

Norman smiles So does Alex

ALEX
Do you have a specific area of
expertise Can you explain to me
how your business works If it is
not too complicated I’m curious

Norman examines her face Maybe there is something she
“needs” after all

EXT TRAIN - NIGHT 54

A wide shot of our train zooming by in the night en route to
Manhattan

OVER VARIOUS IMAGES OF THE TRAIN IN MOVEMENT Norman’s and
Alexs faces are SUPERIMPOSED

SUPERIMPOSED MONTAGE TRAIN - NIGHT 55

We don’t hear their dialogue but we SEE a heightened version
of their conversation

--Norman is explaining something to Alex At first subtly
with a modesty in his facial expressions then with more and
more enthusiasm

--Alex is nodding her head smiling raising her eyebrows
with surprise

--Norman drawing a diagram on a piece of paper with NAMES and
NUMBERS and ARROWS connecting the different names as he did
in the first scene with Philip For this part Alex has put
on her READING GLASSES

EXT TRAIN - PENN STATION - NIGHT 56

The superimposed faces fade out leaving us with an image of
the train entering the final tunnel leading into Penn
Station stopping only an inch from the BUFFER STOP at the
end of the track

INT EXT PENN STATION - NIGHT 57

Norman and Alex exit the train onto the platform We sense
the three hour ride has created a bond between them

Norman takes a BUSINESS CARD out of his wallet and hands it
to Alex It is his last

NORMAN
I know you don’t need anything and
I’m not offering anything I
definitely won’t introduce you to
anyone But take this card
please take it You never know
You never know

Alex accepts Norman’s business card

ALEX
(looking at the card)
Thank you Norman Our ride
together was very interesting

NORMAN
That’s it Come here

( )

57

He pulls her in for a HUG It makes Alex laugh She doesn’t
reciprocate but she doesn’t resist him either

NORMAN (CONT’D)
Take care Alex Good luck

She smiles and takes off toward one of the escalators

As she disappears up the escalator she waves his business
card indicating that she will be in touch

Norman alone on the platform waves back to her satisfied

CUT TO ALEXS FACE Once out of Norman’s sight her smile
disappears She places Norman’s card in her purse and takes a
deep troubled breath

INT PENN STATION DUNKIN DONUTS - NIGHT 58

Alex is sitting by a table alone in the only shop that is
open at this hour She is looking at her YELLOW LEGAL PAD on
which Norman scribbled the messy diagram with names and
arrows specifying next to each name what he or she “NEEDS”
or “CAN GIVE”

Alex is copying down the names to a new sheet of paper

Then she looks up From her POV we see

INT PENN STATION - NIGHT - SAME TIME 59

On the other side of the station entering the closed-off
waiting area Norman is wandering through the empty seats
finally sitting down He takes off his shoes He pulls out of
his pocket a box of MIKE AND IKES chewing on them 3 at a
time

Alex is watching him from a distance She picks up his
business card and decides to dial his number

We see Norman look at his phone and answer the call

NORMAN
Hello

ALEX
Hi It’s Alex From the train
Just now

NORMAN
Alex I’m so glad you called I’m
just getting into a cab Should I
pick you up Where are you

ALEX
I’m still at Penn Station

( )

59

We see Norman look around wondering if he is caught He
can’t see Alex through the glass barriers and across the
hall but Alex is not hiding from him It feels as if she
actually wants him to see her

NORMAN
On the street

ALEX
No I’m still inside

Norman is silent for a second

ALEX (CONTD)
Is everything okay Norman

NORMAN
Yes of course Everything is
perfect Couldn’t be better This
whole evening it’s like I’m
floating on a cloud What about you
- are you okay Why did you call

Alex looks down at the diagram on her pad Then--

ALEX
I realized just now that I didn’t
give you my number and I wanted you
to have it You never know

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE FOUR MONTHS LATER

INT STAIRWELL 60

We are looking down from the third floor of a creak
stairwell in Rabbi Blumenthal’s synagogue WE HEAR HEAVY
FOOTSTEPS CLIMBING UP THE STEPS A PHONE RINGS

NORMAN (0C)
(out-of-breath trying to
whisper )

Philip I’m in a meeting can I

call you back in about twenty
minutes --Yes I’1l call you Bye -

No Not yet I need to find the
right moment Trust me okay

Please don’t say that I as ed you

minutes Bye --Yes Bye Thank

INT STAIRWELL THIRD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 61

Norman gradually ascends step after heavy step revealing
himself to us

( )

61

He doesn’t look like everything is perfect He is fatigued
from the walk-up carrying his coat scarf gloves hat
umbrella and PHONE in his hands

Norman looks at his phone for a moment deliberating whether
or not to make a cal Finally he decides to press CALL

INT HANNA’S OFFICE - EVENING - ISRAEL 62

Hanna is by her desk in the prime minister’s office in
Jerusalem Her phone is RINGING but she is letting it ring

There is a TREMENDOUS BOUQUET OF ROSES on her desk

Hanna looks tired and upset holding her head looking down
at a CARD We close in on the card It reads IM SO SORRY
PLEASE PLEASE FORGIVE ME NORMAN OPPENHEIMER

INT STAIRWELL THIRD FLOOR - AT THE SAME TIME 63

With dilated nostrils Norman inhales and exhales twice
before he gives up and hangs up

Norman closes his eyes as if to restart his mood

When he opens his eyes he has resolved himself for whatever
lies ahead He exits the frame

INT BANQUET HALL - DAY 64

This is a medium size hall on the third floor of the
synagogue

A group of 9 MEN and 3 WOMEN are convened around a table in
the center of this elegant but outdated room conducting what
we will soon find out is a synagogue board meeting Norman
appears at the entrance to this hall

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Look who showed up Our savior
has finally arrived

NORMAN
Sorry I’m late

Norman walks in and sees that the table is scattered with
little paper plates with different NUTS- almonds walnuts
pistachios and peanuts

NORMAN (CONTD)
(moving a plate of nuts)
But that’s no reason to kill me
Can you get rid of the nuts please

INT BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS 65
The nuts are gone

While we focus on Normans face his breathing his eyes
moving around the room as he sits by this table we hear
Rabbi Blumenthal -

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

The situation is very simple The
National Council has decided to
sell the building They are
willing to try their best to keep
our lease as part of whatever
agreement they sign with the new
owners but as we all understand
they can’t Puarantes anything To
be practica we need to raise

ap roximately fourteen million
dollars to save us from the
wrecking ball and insure our future

ere

We see Rabbi Blumenthal’s lips move but we no longer hear
him

Instead we focus on Norman’s agitated face
This takes us into the following FRENETIC FAST MOVING

sequence recapping the events that lead to this board
meeting

INT JO WILF’S OFFICE - SHARED WITH - INT STAPLES STORE
DAY

On one side of the frame we see JO WILF in his GRAND MIDTOWN
OFFICE

On the other side of the frame we see NORMAN in a STAPLES
STORE speaking on his cell phone

JO WILF
Norman Philip tells me you can
help me

NORMAN
You will have my best effort yes

JO WILF
Here talk to Bill

Jo puts the call on SPEAKER - Bill Kavish steps up to the
phone

NORMAN

We see Jo signal to Bill to say no

BILL
Jo had tostep out

(disappointed he has to
deal with Bill)
I’m all yours Go ahead

BILL

We have a colleague who could use a
friendly introduction at the State
Department

NORMAN
The state department

BILL

Yes You do that for us open the
door for him at the state
department get him in a room with
Douglas Gordon - that thing Philip
discussed with Jo - we’ll see what

Jo Wilf looks over at the GROUP OF PEOPLE in his office with
an expression that says - “it’s worth a try”

Norman passes a PEN TESTING PAD He writes down- DOUGLAS

GORDON and takes the page with him

Then - Jo Wilf’s side of the frame is replaced with the
interior of a BULLET PROOF LIMOUSINE in Israel

INTEXT - LIMO IN ISRAEL - SHARED WITH - INT STAPLES STORB7

Hanna and Duby are in the back seat of a limo that is part of
Eshel’s motorcade passing through the streets of Jerusalem

Norman is still in the Staples store looking over a variety
of ENVELOPES on display

NORMAN
Hanna please Just ive me a
minute with him on the phone One
minute Less than a minute This is
something he wants to hear

Hanna looks at Duby who is shaking his head decisively -
Absolutely not

HANNA
I’m really sorry Norman The prime
minister is not available to speak
right now

( )

NORMAN
Then can I speak with Duby Put
Duby on the phone
(whisperin
It has to do with a special request
the prime minister asked me to look
in to

Hanna looks at Duby - Duby is shaking his head - no

HANNA
I’m afraid Duby is also
unavailable I’m sorry Norman
These are busy days for us
Unfortunately I can’t be more
specific but I’m sure you
understand

Norman is visibly distressed by this By now he has walked
over to the OFFICE FURNITURE SECTION He sits down on one of
the office chairs behind one of the desks on display as if
this were his natural work area

Iunderstand Of course Alright
Please let the prime minister know
that I have an answer for him and
if he has a free moment at any
hour day or night it would be
great if we can have a ver very
Short phone conversation a out a
certain individual on the board of

HANNA
(checking with Duby)
I will Norman Thanks for calling

Duby is signaling with his hand to ask who the “certain
individual” is

HANNA (CONTD)
Can you tell me who this person is

ORMAN
«-- I’ll tell the prime minister
all about him when we speak

Duby smiles shaking his head He knows how Norman functions

HANNA
Okay Norman Thank you

NORMAN
No - thank you Hanna Go back to
doing your important work I’m
sorry for interrupting You’re
doing a great job and I know the
prime minister appreciates it
Just don’t forget me Hanna okay

But Hanna has already hung up

INT LIMO - AT THE SAME TIME - ISRAEL 68

HANNA

(to Duby in Hebrew)
What do I do with him That’s the
fifth time I’ve blown him off

DUBY

Don’t say it as if youve done
something wrong That’s your job
Keeping the Normans away

HANNA

Do you know what the prime minister
wanted from him Isn’t David
applying to Harvard

DUBY

I don’t care

Norman does not get passed you No
matter what he says

If he becomes obsessive you can
take a call from him once every few
days so that he doesnt get
paranoid and to keep the
connection alive but never never
put him through Understood Never

Hanna accepts this but she doesn’t like it

DUBY (CONTD)

Don’t worry about Norman Getting
you on the phone is enough for him
More than enough In his head he
just had a conversion with the
prime minister of Israel

INT STAPLES STORE - DAY 69

Norman is by the cashier paying for a package of ENVELOPES
and a CARTRIDGE OF BLACK PRINTER INK He is paying with a few
crumpled single dollar bills and a handful of quarters dimes

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
why don’t youanswer your phone
I’ve been calling all morning

NORMAN
I’m answering now Do you want to
hear what I have to say

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
You spoke to him What did he say

NORMAN
I don’t have a final answer yet
but it looks good I’11 be at the
board meeting with all the details
but let’s just say - get ready for
a surprise

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
What kind of surprise are we
talking about How many zeros does
this surprise have Can you tell me
that at least

NORMAN
(hailing a taxi)
If I tell you where’s the
surprise It’s a considerable
surprise Believe me I gotta go
Rabbi I’1l see you tomorrow

Blumenthal’s study apparently also serves as a CLEANING
SUPPLIES storage place The Rabbi picks up a WINDOW CLEANING
SPRAY because he needs to wrap his fist round something

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Norman you realize how important
this is right They are going to
kick us out of here You need to
give us a firm answer No games
Norman -- Norman

Norman has hung up

Rabbi Blumenthal faces the sweet couple waiting for him
doing his best to erase the anxiety on his face

He is then replaced with Jo Wilf and his team in Wilf’s
office And Norman is now sitting in a bus-stop

his main man Duby I think it will
be okay

71
NORMAN (CONTD)

He was very practical about it

said he would take care of it he

just needs the exact information

Can you send me an e-mail with your

colleagues name

Jo Wilf shakes his head toward Bill Kavish

BILL
No e-mails Norman
His name is Matthias Kone he is an
official in the treasury department
in the Ivory Coast Eshel’s office
will need to reach out to him
Were not involved It has to come
from them Maybe he can join their
delegation in Davos

On Norman’s face The Ivory Coast - that doesn’t sound good
to him

Jo Wilf’s office is replaced with Hanna and Duby now part of
the prime minister’s entourage at an HONORARY DOCTORATE
CEREMONY in an unidentified University

When they see his father’s name on

brought to the dean’s attention

that the son of the prime minister

asking you for hel He doesn’t
have the grades Philip He won’t
get in without serious pressure and
your personal intervention

Philip takes a deep breath He doesn’t like this
Norman has arrived at the 2nd floor Women’s shoes

It is beautiful and colorful and glamorous buzzing with
assertive women shopping for shoes

Norman finds a relatively quiet spot

Philip and Norman each in their separate surroundings are
scratching their heads nervously

NORMAN (CONT’D)
Philip it’s just a call

PHILIP
How is this connected to the rabbi
again Norman Remind me Why am
I doing this

NORMAN
You are doing this because he is
the prime minster of Israel and he
is asking you for a favor

( )

75 75

PHILIP
No He is asking YOU for a favor
Correct me if I’m wrong - you’re
getting the credit for this favor
Not me

NORMAN
What are you talking about -
credit What does this have to do
with credit

PHILIP
I’m going to hang up on you

NORMAN
We are sharing the credit Philip
He knows you are my contact

PHILIP
Does he

NORMAN
He will I’11 make sure of it

PHILIP

Why do I have a feeling he is going
to think Jo Wilf is the magician
who got his son into Harvard

NORMAN

Why are you giving me a hard time
Do you want Rabbi Blumenthal to
perform this wedding or not All
you have to do is pick up the phone
and talk to one of your buddies at
Harvard on behalf of the prime
minister of Israel Is that really
so difficult for you

SILENCE We sense it is extremely difficult for Philip

PHILIP
Ill make the call I can’t promise
anything though

NORMAN
Thank you

PHILIP
Don’t belittle what I’m doing In
the world of Harvard admissions
this is the biggest no no in the
book It’s like incest It’s taboo

NORMAN
That’s funny because Rabbi
Blumenthal is going to think the
exact same thing when he finds out
I’m asking him to marry a Cohen and
a convert who hasn’t even
officially converted

has any idea what Norman is talking about

One of the ASSISTANTS is even going through today’s Times
looking for clues but can’t seem to find anything of special
interest

I’m not following you Did you
speak to him or not

Here let me read to you the last
message I received from Hanna

BILL
Who’s Hanna

NORMAN
Hanna is Duby’s assistant

Who the hell is Duby

NORMAN
That is whatI’m trying to explain
to you Eshel and Duby are sitting
with the national security
committee as we speak There is no
way for me to get through to them
right now but Hanna who is on the
other side of that closed door
said

Jo is losing his patience he picks up the phone

JO
Norman cut the bullshit When you
get Eshel on the phone and he says
yes to you call me back Until
that happens don’t waste anymore
of my time

NORMAN
But Jo this is time sensitive If
I can’t tell Rabbi Blumenthal that
you are putting up the money
someone else is going to buy the
building He needs an answer

alone in her bed

it continues buzzing in Eshel’s closet

We close in on Normans face He is exhausted consumed by
frustration It leads us back to--

INT BANQUET HALL - DAY 86
Back in the hall Rabbi Blumenthal is still speaking

( )

86

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Or we leave here and start
looking for a new location
wandering from one temporary
arrangement to another Which in my
humble opinion would mean the end
of this community

There is a collective sigh and groan around the table

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT’D)
Yeah But let’s not despair -
this is where our friend Norman
Oppenheimer comes in Norman

All eyes shift to Norman

Norman looks up takes a sip from his plastic cup of orange
juice wipes his mouth with a napkin and -

NORMAN
I might have a donor who will match
your pledges up to seven million
In other words if ye raise half
the amount the building is yours
Ours I mean

BOARD MEMBER 1
Who’s the donor

NORMAN
Can’t say He will remain
anonymous

BOARD MEMBER 2
Who donates seven million dollars
and wants to stay anonymous That
doesn’t make sense

BOARD MEMBER 3 BOARD MEMBER 1
What do you care He’s a It’s a legitimate question
modest man As long as he’s It’s a lot of money we
good for it should know who he is

BOARD MEMBER 2
Do we know this person Is he or
she a member of the community
Is he sitting here in the room
right now

We cut to see the members of the board around the table
looking at each other then back at Norman

BOARD MEMBER 2 (CONTD)

What Maybe this is a money
laundering scheme Does he want
anything in return this anonymous
donor

Norman is shaking his head with a polite smile on his face
His lips are seale

FEMALE BOARD MEMBER BOARD MEMBER 1

I have a feeling I know who Are we playing a guessing

we are talking about Does game now

his last name start with an

BOARD MEMBER 2
If he can say goodb e to seven
million why wont he just pay for
the whole thing
It’s just a number for these
people it’s not real money

Our view moves down Normans body following his arm to his
hands to his fingers SCRATCHING his SWOLLEN AND INFLAMED
CALF It is an obsessive scratch that leaves BLOOD STAINS on
Norman’s fingernails when we see him bring his hand back up
to the table

BOARD MEMBER 1
Seven million is real When you get
into the hundreds of millions
that’s another story

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

Let’s not get greedy This is a
very generous gift And it should
motivate our entire community to
become involved

(placing his hand on

Norman’s shoulder)
Thanks to Norman we are only seven
million dollars away from finally
owning our home

We close in on Norman with the rabbi’s hand weighing on his
shoulder

BOARD MEMBER 2 (0S)
But we need some kind of letter
How do we know he even exits With
all due respect

FEMALE BOARD MEMBER (0S BOARD MEMBER 1 (0S)
A letter of intent You nee Some kind of written
a letter commitment

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
You can give us a letter right A
formal letter

Norman notices his blood-stained fingernails and immediately
conceals them in his fist

BOARD MEMBER 2 (0S) FEMALE BOARD MEMBER (0S)
Notarized It should be Legally binding
notarized

Just as the picture FADES OUT we see Norman’s face reveal
the slightest sign of discomfort

FADE OUT

INT MAIN SANCTUARY - LATER 87

Norman is sitting alone on one of the benches He has his
swollen leg up resting on the seat next to him

He is looking at the MEMORIAL PLAQUE - hundreds of names
engraved in bronze sheets on the wall

Cutting to a new angle we realize we are seeing Norman from
the POV of Rabbi Blumenthal who is standing by the door

Feeling his presence Norman puts his leg down They exchange
a smile

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
It’s worth saving Whoever your
guy is he is doing a great thing
Thank you

Norman accepts the acknowledgment with a nod Just as R
Blumenthal is about to leave --

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT’D)
You sure you can’t tell me who it
is I probably should know I’d
like to thank him Just between
you and me Is it Arthur Taub

NORMAN
He was very clear about staying
anonymous

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Maybe just Can you tell me why
he is doing this

Norman thinks about this for a moment

NORMAN
He can afford it He knows me I
told him about the community and
the history of the building and he
said sure why not It is money he
gives away anyway If not to us
then to some other charity

The rabbi accepts that answer although we sense there is a
trace of skepticism still there

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

And why does he insist on remaining
anonymous

( )

87

There is a fraction of a second before Norman responds that
indicates he might not have a good answer But then he is
back on the ball --

NORMAN

Because if peo le find out he did
this kind o ing there will be
hundreds of other requests It is
not his usual type of charity He
is doing this as a favor to me And
I promised him I won’t reveal his
name

The rabbi is nodding his head examining Norman’s face

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

Well It is a good thing That’s
all I can say Please thank him on
behalf of all of us
Not that raising the other half is
going to be easy But the
challenge - It’s good It’s good
We should all open up our hearts
and wallets God knows there are
some big wallets in this community
(he pauses)
If there is any way you think it
would be appropriate to honer this
myst terious man or woman some kind

dedication Or if there is
something you would like me to

O

Norman has been waiting for this opening from the beginning
of the scene

NORMAN
Now that you mention it the person
who introduced me to Mr Anonymous
is my nephew a very successful
young lawyer maybe I mentioned him
o you - Philip ohen He Just got
engaged to a very sweet girl

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Mazaltov

NORMAN
-from a Korean background
He could use some help with her
conversion and officiating the
wedding

R Blumenthal is nodding his head understanding that he is
cornered

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Philip Cohen

NORMAN
If it was simple he wouldn’t need
your help

( )

87

A beat Then

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Have him give me a call I’1l see
what I can do

A transaction has been made

NORMAN
Thank you Rabbi

R Blumenthal places his hat on his head takes a moment to
himself then he exits the building

Once alone in the sanctuary after he hears the main doors
shut Norman lifts his swollen leg back up

He pulls at the cuff of his pants enough to reveal the
BLEEDING HIVES on his calf and around the swollen ankle -
But Norman doesnt want to look at it so he immediately
covers it back up

He takes out his phone We see his screen He goes to
CONTACTS He scrolls through the names on his screen -
hundreds of names zoom by

They mesh with The MEMORIAL PLAQUES on the wall - the names
fill the frame - Zoltans and Sigmunds and Isadoras and
Miklos Weinbergers Mandelbaums Rolats and Lefkowitzs -
dissolving into each other creating a blurry collage of
contacts on Norman’s phone and the dead sounding Jewish names
on the wall

We hear Norman on the phone

You’re all set Call Rabbi
Blumenthal He’s expecting your
call

There are 2 SECRET SERVICE MEN standing near them but Duby
and Eshel are speaking as if they were alone

I don’t like this It smells like
something Maor would do

DUBY
We can learn a thing or two from
Maor Sometimes you have to hold
your nose and smile politely

A89

DUBY (CONTD
It is all a question of balance
The Russians need to see that you
are aware of their interests

ESHEL
Just so that we both understand
what we are talking about A
Russian gas company is jeopardizing
our peace talks and getting between
us and the Turks because
reconciliation in this area is a
threat to their monopoly in Europe

Duby nods his head Eshel doesn’t like this

DUBY
Even if it seems dirty to you it
is important and necessary The
Americans are backing our talks for
the exact same reason - to break
the Russian monopoly in the
European gas market No difference
For us it is just a question of
keeping the right balance between
all these interests

ESHEL
So now we are calling it ‘balance’

DUBY
I like the word balance more than I
like compromise

Dub opens the door and with a slight touch on Eshel’s lower

bac

e pushes him into the reception

We hear cameras clicking from the other side of the door

INT RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT A89

Eshel has a frozen smile on his face as a DELEGATION OF
RUSSIAN BUSINESSMEN is being introduced to him in procession

Duby is standing next to him both impressed and a bit

worried by Eshe

mingling with Russian delegation members in a way that is
much too friendly

The fake smile on Eshel’s face goes sour right before the cut
to

Eshel in his underwear is pacing the room

ESH
Something doesn’ t feel right I
don’t know what it is But there is
a lump in my chest when there
shouldn’t be My intentions are
pure They are I’m pretty sure
they are

He pauses as if to check within himself for any
contaminating intentions

ESHEL (CONTD)
A decent moral good human being
can’t function in these circles of
ower money national pride It’s
impossible

He enters his walk-in closet and is drawn to look in the box
containing his old private CELL PHONE

He picks up the phone and his charging cable

ESHEL (CONTD)
The internal moral compass that a
private person navigates with is
completely useless for a leader of
a country Right

( )

We now see that all this time he has been talking to Naomi
his wife who is lying in bed with a book in her hand half
listening to him without losing her place on the page

Eshel plugs his phone cable into an outlet
Eshel smiles

ESHEL (CONTD)

Look at that my private life still

has a signal

NAOMI

I meant to ask you - do you want
me to continue paying the bill for
that phone It’s costing us about

four hundred shekel a month
ESHEL
(going through missed

calls

Yeah lets keep it But we should
try to get on a better plan They
must have a cheaper plan than that

Why is it four hundred shekel I

haven’t used it in months Do they

know it’s mine

NAOMI
I’1l1 call customer service
tomorrow

It comes to life

From his POV we see his screen as he scrolls passed the

missed calls from Norman

ESHEL

Norman Oppenheimer was looking for

me I should call him He has

always helped that lump in my chest

disappear

NAOMT
And I never understood why
If anything he should make that
lump feel worse

ESHEL
Why do you say that He’s a good
friend I’ve never met anyone as
generous as he is

Eshel climbs into bed
NAOMI
Generous is a strange way to
describe him

ESHEL

He is He has a tremendous heart

She puts her book down

( )

NAOMI
Okay without saying anything
negative about Norman Oppenheimer
he’s not your “friend” He’s
someone that you take advantage of
when it’s convenient for you

ESHEL
I doubt he feels that way
That’s actually pretty insulting

NAOMI
No it’s not It’s just the reality
When you needed him in New York you
allowed him to enter you life now
that you don’t need him anymore
you completely ignore him But I’m
not complaining about that because
I think he’s an embarrassing human
being and he shouldn’t have been in
your life in the first place

ESHEL
(placing his hand over his
chest)
Now you’re making that lump feel
worse You really think I deceived
him in some way

NAOMI
Ma Maybe not consciously And I
ieve you that you consider him a
friends But I think the right thing
to do at least at this point is
not to take anymore favors from
im

Eshel thinks about this for a second He seems to agree with
what Naomi is saying He puts his phone down and looks over
at Naomi

Then Switching tone

ESHEL
I don’t remember you protesting
when Norman offered to help connect
us to that Harvard guy for
Davidy

NAOMT
No but I didn’t feel comfortable
with it and it still bothers me

ESHEL
But you went along with it We
took the favor

NAOMI
Honestly - what went through my
mind was that Norman probably can’t
deliver on this anyway that it’s
jest another empty promise so I
idn’t see the point in making a
fuss over it

( )

89

ESHEL
And you also really want Davidy to
get into Harvard so you figured
youll let this one go If it
doesn’t help it wont’ hurt
either Right

NAOMI
No In fact if you must know - I
did think it might hurt Davidy The
last person in the world he wants a
referral from especially at
Harvard is Norman Oppenheimer But
I didn’t want to hurt Norman’s
feelings and since I didn’t think
anything would come of it anyway
yes I let it go

They remain in silence for a beat

ESHEL
I’m glad you didn’t hurt his
feelings That was very nice of
you

NAOMI
(turning around and
shutting off the light
You’re in no position to judge me

“Unnamed New York businessman is central figure in an
investigation into payments made to Israels prime minister”

With a picture of Eshel and Duby on the edge of the frame
whispering something in the prime minister’s ear

INTEXT STARBUCKS - DAY 93

The Starbucks is extremely crowded Norman is by the window
bar with his PAPER

To his left and right people and their elaborate coffees and
muffins are pushing against him while he reads

( )

93

“Israeli prosecutors asked a Jerusalem court on Tuesday for
permission to take testimony from a foreign man”

Norman’s brain is working

Out the window across the street we notice a MAN who looks
as if he just stepped out of an East European Shtetl looking
directly at Norman

INT ESHEL’S RESIDENCE - MORNING - ISRAEL 94

Eshel by his breakfast table eating a croissant with jam
together with his 2 BODY GUARDS ooking at the front page
of an Israeli paper where this mysterious investigation is
the big story of the day with a bold headline that reads “IT
STINKS”

And a caricature of Eshel as a PROUD PEACOCK on top of a pile
of rotten EGGS
INT BRUCE SCHWARTZ’S OFFICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY 95

Bruce is on the phone while he scans the newspaper on his
desk

We see another piece of the item (or hear Bruce read it)

“Speculation about Eshel’s future has weakened him
politically even as he undertakes delicate negotiations with
Israel’s neighbors”

BRUCE
Is this serious Do we need to be
worried
INT DUBY’S OFFICE - DAY - ISRAEL 96

Duby is on the other side of the line looking down at a pile
of Israeli newspapers all with variations of the word
CORRUPTION in their headlines

DUBY
(clearly very worried)
I don’t know yet

BRUCE
Can we help

DUBY
Maybe I don’t know who this
businessman is yet but if he is an
American citizen he can’t testify
without your justice department
being part of the procedure

BRUCE
Let me look into this

INTEXT STARBUCKS - DAY 97
Norman looks down at his phone scrolling down his contacts
stroking his face scratching his ear He dials - PHILIP
COHEN

INT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY - AT THE SAME TIME 98

Philip is getting out of an elevator waving good mornings to
his co-workers as he makes his way to his office and speaks
to Norman

PHILIP
Doesn’t look good for your guy Do
ou know who he is the New York
usinessman

NORMAN
If I did is there any way we can
help Eshel

PHILIP
Careful Don’t put your nose into
this if you don’t have to This
kind of investigation brings the
worst out of everyone

As Norman speaks he looks out the window

From Normans POV we see the SHTETL MAN pacing the sidewalk
right outside the Starbucks unapologetically ooking at
Norman as if he is waiting for him

ORMAN
But what do you think Does it
sound serious

Philip enters a room full of people waiting for him

PHILIP
Oh it’s serious Bribery is
tricky Especially in Israel where
you have the Mideastern mentality
of giving baksheesh and cutting
corners and a legal system run by
tight-assed German yekkes If they
can prove he accepted a gift he’s
done He could end up in jail
Gotta go

He hangs up

INT EXT STARBUCKS - AT THE SAME TIME 99

So does Norman He is confused Outside we still see the
Shtetl man

Norman is contemplating something He looks at the contact
list on his phone

100 INT CAROL RASKIN’S OFFICE - DAY 100

We are in the United States Attorney’s office in lower
Manhattan

There are 5 LAWYERS in this room one of them the berson in
charge is CAROL RASKIN who is speaking directly to--

Alex Green sitting across her desk

Carol is holding a copy of the New York Times in her hand as
she disciplines Alex

CAROL

You have the president of the
United States inquiring about an
investigation that I don’t even
know about This is not the Middle
East Ms Green In this part of
the world there are rules There
are regulations There are
agreements between countries on how
to obtain evidence in a criminal
case Especially if it has to do
with a leader of a foreign country
How could I not know this
investigation was going on

ALEX
Because it’s not going on Yet It
is a newspaper headline not an
investigation

CAROL
So where are they getting this
from Is the Israeli police
questioning an American citizen or
no

ALEX
As far as I understand theyre
still figuring out if they a
enough information to make a proper
request The witness doesn’t even
know he is a witness at this point

CAROL
(confused)
Wait You didn’t speak to this guy

yet
Alex hesitates before she answers

CAROL (CONTD)
It’s a simple question Did you
speak to him

ALEX
I did On a train A casual
conversation that lead me to make
some inquiries and file a report
That is all it is right now
(MORE )

( )

ALEX (CONTD)

A report The Israeli prosecution

is still considering whether or not

to submit a request for legal

assistance But someone there

leaked this to the Israeli press

before I even had a chance to speak

to the witness

CAROL
Who is he What’s his name Your
witness

ALEX
He claims he is a friend of yours
Do you still want to know his name

CAROL
I’1l find out sooner or later
Who is he

ALEX
His name in Norman Oppenheimer

EXT OUTSIDE THE STARBUCKS - DAY 101

Norman is exiting the Starbucks with his paper under his arm
and his coffee in his hand

But then he stops in his steps He thinks for a moment He
has an idea

INT CAROL

RASKIN’S OFFICE - DAY 102

CAROL
Norman Oppenheimer

Alex nods her head

Carol places the newspaper on her desk leans back in her
chair and smiles

CAROL (CONT’D)
Norman Oppenheimer

ALEX
Yes

CAROL
Are you kidding me

Alex shakes her head Carol loses her smile

CAROL (CONTD)
Unbelievable
(takes a moment)

(MORE)

( )

CAROL (CONTD

You’re going to topple down a
democratically elected acting
prime minister and jeopardize
America’s long term foreign policy
because of something Norman
Oppenheimer told you on a train

Alex remains silent

INT STARBUCKS - DAY

Norman is back in the Starbucks waiting for the restroom As
he waits he is restless He seems excited about something
Perhaps he is rehearsing a conversation in his head

INT CAROL RASKIN’S OFFICE - DAY

CAROL

(deep breath
Alright I’m glad we had this
meeting No harm done m going to
call Bruce Schwartz and tel him
there is no investigation involving
an American citizen going on End
of story False alarm We can all
relax

Carol looks up at Alex to see if she is understanding her

But Alex’s expression is anything but relaxing

CAROL (CONT’D)

Don’t give me that look Norman
Oppenheimer is not a friend of
mine I know him like I know four
million other people I don’t even
remember what the connection is He
knows a cousin of mine He sends
me e-mails I don’t think I’ve
ever responded to him If he turns
out to be a crook I couldn’t care
less But trust me- Norman
Oppenheimer might be a royal nudge
but he is not to villain He’s a
poor lonely shmo trying to
survive And he is a pathological
liar in case you didn’t notice

ALEX
I dont think he is a villain
either but over the past three
years he has been unusually
generous toward the prime minister
of Israel and has Sf peop an
intricate network of cop le who
benefit from the access e provides
for them In my part of the world -
that kind of behavior warrants an
investigation Especially if he is
a pathological liar

( )

104

Carol takes her point but before she has a chance to
respond Alexs phone RINGS

ALEX (CONT’D
Sorry Ill shut it of

As she reaches to shut off her phone she sees the name on
the screen NORMAN OPPENHEIMER

She shows the screen to Carol as it continues to ring

CAROL
Why is he calling you

ALEX
I don’t know
CAROL
I thought you said he doesn’t know
about this
ALEX
He doesn’t Not from me
INT STARBUCKS RESTROOM - AT THE SAME TIME 105

Norman is now in the restroom anxiously waiting for Alex to
pick up He has balanced his coffee on the rim of the sink

INT CAROL RASKIN’S OFFICE - AT THE SAME TIME 106
CAROL
Go ahead Take the call Put him on
speaker

Alex places her phone on the desk and puts Norman on speaker

ALEX
Hello

WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE RESTROOM AND CAROL’S OFFICE

NORMAN
Alex Green This is Norman from
the train Norman Qppenheimer - I’ve
been meaning to call How are
you How have you been

ALEX
(her eyes locked on
Carols)
I’m fine Norman How are you

NORMAN
Fine Fine Can’t complain I just
got in from Chicago actually
(MORE )

( )

106
NORMAN (CONTD)
Listen do you have a minute You
probably know why I’m calling

ALEX
I can guess yes

NORMAN
Don’t worry I know how discrete
ou are so if Im imposing feel
ree to tell me it’s none of my
business I’m not going to ask you
for the guy’s name either
Unless you can tell me
Can you

Alex looks at Carol for guidance She seems just as clueless

NORMAN (CONT’D
Forget it Forget it I didnt ask
I respect your professionalism But
just tell me one thing You’re
the one dealing with this
investigation right This is your
department isn’t it

ALEX
Norman

Carol is signaling with her hand to Alex to let Norman go on

NORMAN ALEX (CONTD)
Yes I’m sorry Please continue

NORMAN
I’1l tell you why I’m calling I
hope it’s okay I know this is
delicate but I feel it is my duty
I think I can help you out

A pause for quizzical looks between Alex and Carol

Norman who is hyper inadvertently knocks his coffee over
It is on his pants the floor everywhere

There is an INDUSTRIAL MOP in the room Norman tries to
detach the mop from the BUCKET AND WRINGER as he speaks but
it is stuck--

NORMAN (CONTD)
It is no secret that I’m on Eshel’s
team I support him I love him I
think he is doing amazing things
but I was just thinking - whoever
this person is this unnamed
businessman I probably know him
Right Maybe I can shed some light
on whatever it is that happened and
help you make sense of it Another
point of view for you to consider
that’s all I’m offering here If it
helps Eshel too it is the least I
can do

( )

106

Carol is completely bewildered by Norman’s tactics
Alex seems too shocked to say anything

And Norman in the restroom has finally detached the mop
splashing soap-water all over himself and the room and
toppling over the bucket

NORMAN (CONTD)
What do you say Alex Meet me for
coffee There is a reason why we
met on that train You never
know Right You never know

Alex looks up at Carol for her verdict Reluctantly Carol
nods her head with approval

ALEX
How is today at four Come to my
office in the consulate

Norman smiles at his reflection in the restroom mirror He
did it He got his foot in

NORMAN
Perfect

As he grabs a bunch of paper towels out of the dispenser

INT STARBUCKS - CONTINUOUS 107
Norman wet and disheveled with his wet newspaper still
under his arm casually exits the restroom eng his over the
puddle that has formed around the door noddin is head
apologetically to the 3 ANNOYED CUSTOMERS waiting outside

We catch a glimpse of SHTETL MAN now standing on line for
coffee But Norman is too preoccupied to notice him

Norman is on his phone as he exits the Starbucks

INT PHILIP’S OFFICE - DAY 108

PHILIP
Did you find out who it is

NORMAN
Better I’m meeting the
investigator who is in charge of
the whole thing Come downstairs
Give me five minutes

PHILIP
Norman I can’t

But Norman has hung up

EXT ENTRANCE TO PHILIP’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 110
Madison Ave - busy crowded mid-town sidewalks and Norman
waiting anxiously by the entrance to Philip’s office

building
Norman sees Philip rushing out

NORMAN
Thanks for coming down

PHILIP
What are you doing You’re acting
like a maniac Look at you
Why are you getting involved This
thing is bad for Israel bad for
America bad for Jews bad for
everybody Step away

It is bad for ev everybody that’s why
I want to help

PHILIP
How can you help It’s a political
war going on seven thousand miles
from here Eshel’s rivals found
this cockamamie story and they’re
going to use it to take him down
There is nothing you can do about
it Don’t get involved It is too
1g

Philip looks at Norman to see if his reasoning is entering
his head It isn’t--

NORMAN
Just tell me one thing
Hypothetically if this guy this
businessman came to you for
advice If he wanted you to
represent him What would you tell
im

( )

110
PHILIP
why You want to approach him It’s
ad idea
NORMAN

Maybe if we give him an option that
isn’t so harmful to Eshel

Philip looks at Norman trying to figure out what his real
interest here is Norman is looking back at him waiting for
an answer

PHILIP
Id throw him out of my office
That’s what I’d do I wouldn’t want
anything to do with him He is a
threat to an acting prime minister
Even if it doesn’t end up having
any criminal implication
apparently his dealings with Eshel
are embarrassing enough so that his
olitical rivals think they can use
im to hurt Eshel Eshel’s people
can’t ignore that They have too
much to lose They’re going to
strike back Dig up everything they
can find on this guy The FBI will
et involved No matter how you
ook at it this guy is fucked
And you want to avoid him like the
plague

NORMAN
What if you knew him and he was
asking you for help

Philip takes this in Suddenly it dawns on him - Norman may
be the unnamed businessman He carefully considers his next
words

PHILIP
Are you saying something I don’t
want to hear What are you saying

NORMAN
I’m not saying anything I’m just
asking

PHILIP

Norman listen to me Whoever this
unnamed businessman is he is in
very serious trouble And he needs
e very careful about what he
says now and who he speaks to

Norman thinks this over for a moment
NORMAN
I’m only asking if there is a legal

way to defuse this
(MORE )

( )

NORMAN (CONTD)
If I’m meeting the investigator
and I find out who this man is I
want to be able to offer him
something Let’s think creatively

Philip can’t conceal his panic He takes a step back

PHILIP
I’m not sure I can offer him
anything This man needs a very
good criminal lawyer Don’t be
creative And don’t meet this
investigator

They look at each other

PHILIP (CONTD)
Can you do that

Norman seems confused But he nods his head

Philip backs away verifying with his eyes that Norman has
internalized his instructions He disappears into the

building

Norman is pacing the street with his phone in his hand It is
bigger than him And he can’t resist it

Across the street we see THE SHTETL MAN but Norman doesn’t
notice him

delivered with much pathos by

We focus on Eshels face on Duby’s face on Hanna’s face as
they are forced to hear sentences like

RON MAOR

Weve seen politicians with no
backbone gain power before - that
is not new We’ve seen political
opportunists who grossly distort
the will of the citizens ome voted
them into office only t

shamefully gain favor in “the eyes
of foreign rulers in service o
interests that are not our own -
that is not new either But never
in our nation’s history has a man

spiritually empty

unapologetically hedonistic
selfish I dare say - been ina
position to do so much damage to
our people and our nation as the
man Im pointing to right now

Hanna’s phone is blinking She looks at her screen
NORMAN

It is

She shows it to Duby whois standing next to her by the side

door to the parliament hall

Duby shakes his head

DUBY
No Not today I can’t deal with
Norman

HANNA

But if I don’t answer he will drive
me crazy all day He’1ll call every

answer

information as I can but if Duby
wants to brief me before this
meeting that might make the
meeting more productive

Hanna doesn’t know what to say

HANNA
Norman I don’t think it is such a
good idea for you

NORMAN

Will you give them this message
Tell them I’m meeting with Alex
Green today They can use me
however they want I’m like a

Norman stops by the CHOCOLATIER where he saw Eshel in the
beginning of the film while he waits We see his POV looking
into the shop beautiful colorful chocolate treats

Rich chocolate and direct access to power - his heart is
palpitating with excitement Finally

Shut up and listen to what I’m

saying to you I don’t want you

meeting anybody on our behalf

Creating the impression that in
someway you are connected to our

crime Do you understand me

glass

DUBY (CONTD)

I want to make sure I am clear
about this Stop using the prime
minister’s name Just stop Don’t
do it anymore He is not your
friend and you do not have an
relationship with him I forbid you
to meet with this woman

Do you understand what I’m saying
Answer me

Norman’s eyes are focused on a tray with beautiful NUT COATED
TRUFFLES

Then the focus changes - reflected in the shop window Norman
notices the THE SHTETL MAN standing across the street He
realizes that this man has been following him around since he
first saw him through the Starbucks window

After a pause

NORMAN
Yes I understand

DUBY
Good Goodbye Norman

Duby hangs up exits the smoking area and hands the phone
back to Hanna as if the phone itself is contaminated

DUBY (CONT’D)

Enough Don’t answer his calls
anymore He is cut off No more
Just the thought of him talking to
an investigator makes me want to
vomit And find out who Alex Green
is

Something is bothering Hanna

DUBY (CONTD)
What is it

HANNA
I’m not sure it was such a good
idea to insult Norman that way

( )

115 115

DUBY
That’s the problem with these
Normans —- they’re a double edged
sword - if you keep them in the
loop you become more and more
dependant on them until they
gradually own you - if you cut them
off they blackmail you for the
rest of your life

HANNA
i prbink he is just trying to help
you would have told him nicely
tha he would be helping us if he
didn’t speak to anyone I think
that would have been more
effective

DUBY
I don’t want to talk about Norman
anymore Lets find out who this
businessman is I need a name Ina
day every newspaper in the world
ill want to know who this man is
and we need to be prepared

He walks back into the parliament hall

How will we explain this tragic
historical accident to our children
and grandchildren How I ask you
BY preventing it By voting against
this dangerous agreement
Masquerading as a peace treaty

Eshel receives the note He opens it
It reads “WHO IS HE”

Eshel looks over at Duby signaling with his hands and
sincere eyes - “I have no idea”

skeletons in his closet sex
offenses tax fraud money

dare put him on the witness stand

Hanna is confused

HANNA
You know who he is Who is he

DUBY
Just do what I said And make it
sound as if you are telling this to
him in confidence behind my back
Make him swear not to repeat what
he just heard

Hanna gets it

HANNA
You think he’ll repeat it all to
the investigator

DUBY
He’1l be trying to prove to her
that he knows what’s going on And
not only to her He’1ll spread the
word all over the place and he’11
probably exaggerate it so that it
sounds even worse Call him Make
him believe there is nothing to
worry about His beloved prime
minister is perfectly fine
Go Make the call

meet with that investigator You
told him not to

businessman --I can’t tell you

how relieved I am to hear you say
this Thank you Hanna Please tell
Duby that I understand his
situation completely And if there
is anything he needs me to do he
knows I’m here for him and for the
rime minister -- That’s what I
ike to hear The prime minister is
a very lucky man to have you on his
side Hanna You know that right
Really this kind of loyalty is so
rare It’s sacred I hope you know

that --Of course Say no more
My lips are sealed Good luck
Hanna

By now Norman has stepped off the escalator and pulled out
his METRO CARD But instead of going through the turnstile
he stops in his steps

Invigorated with a new sense of purpose Norman changes his
mind about taking the subway He turns back to get on the
escalator going back up to street level

As he heads up he sees the Shtetl man on the downward
escalator THEIR EYES MEET as they pass each other

The Shtetl man immediately turns around and heads up against
the direction of the escalator so not to lose Norman

At this point Norman understands that he is being followed
He quickly cuts through the crowd towards the exit

OMITTED 119-121

Norman exits Grand Central into the busy street startled

We see Norman’s POV - New Yorkers of all ages color class

SRUL KATZ

NORMAN

Don’t believe what you hear

SRUL KATZ
You obviously know more than me
but whoever it is one thing is for
sure It’s a conspiracy They found
a way to assassinate Eshel without
actually killing him

Norman thinks about this for a second

NORMAN
Don’t bury Eshel yet Trust me
He’s not going anywhere

SRUL KATZ
Why what do you know

NORMAN
I can’t go into details but let’s
just say this unnamed businessman
is He’s a nobody » a parasite
trying to extort the prime
minister He is the lowest of the
low He made up a story The
whole thing is made up Eshel
doesn’t even know the man

his breathing Srul notices Norman’s stress and waits
patiently for Norman to recompose

A LOUD BUZZER IS HEARD UNLOCKING THE DOOR

126 INT CONSULATE SECURITY BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 126

This is a two door system The second door won’t open until
the first door is closed But Norman is afraid to have both
doors closed at the same time so he keeps his foot in the
first door

The walls of this small isolated security booth are all
dark one-way mirrors

SECURITY GUARD VOICE
Mr Oppenheimer you need to close
the first door for the second door
to open

Before he removes his foot from the door - Norman looks back
outside -

The glare of daylight is strong and blinding but Norman is
pretty sure Srul Katz is still standing there smiling

We sense that Norman is recognizing something in Srul’s face -
as if he has seen this smile before

But the door closes And locks Before Norman can put his
finger on why and where Srul is familiar to him

Norman presses his face against the one-way mirror to try 4 and
see what is behind it but all he sees is his own distorted
reflection Norman panics and tries to reopen the door

NORMAN
(to the one-way mirror)

And now finally we see Alex in her office in sync speaking
directly to Norman

Over her head on the office walls we see FRAMED PICTURES
with images of the Israeli Tourism Ministry’s version of
Middle Eastern bliss

--THE FISH --THE DEAD SEA -- THE FARMERS -- THE CAMEL-
they are all framed pictures hanging on the wall behind Alex
Our focus changes to Alex’s face

ALEX
Because I think the kind of
relationship youve established
with the prime minister of Israel
is illegal I think it is corrupt

INT MEN’S CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - DAY A133

A shot of Eshel reflected in the mirrors of the fitting room
from the scene in the beginning of the film as he tries on

Norman is smiling but by now we know him well enough to
sense a nervousness in his eyes and the itch around his neck

WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A MOVING TRAIN taking us to

INT EXT TRAIN - NIGHT 133

We flash back to the scene on the train from Washington to

ALEX
Do you have a specific area of
expertise Can you explain to me
how your business works If it is

not too complicated I’m curious
NORMAN

Have you ever played rummikub
ALEX

Sure
NORMAN

My mother used tohate playing with
me because I would mess up the
board break up existing sets and
try to create new ones with
whatever lousy pieces I had on my
rack Sometimes I’d mess it up so
bad there was no way to put
everything back My mother would go
crazy She’d say if you don’t have
a specific simple move just pick
up a tile and let the game continue
tothe next player But usually
all I needed to finish my turn is
one little Joker That’s all you
need If you have the Joker you
can afford to take some risks
Somehow with a Joker in your hand
all the tiles fall into place

ALEX
I’m sorry I still don’t
understand

NORMAN
That’s what I do I’m the Joker As
soon as you put me in the game
things work out Here let me show
you

had drawn for her It takes us bac

This does not come naturally for Alex but she reaches out
and touches Norman’s trembling hand Norman needs this
gesture He allows her to keep her fingers over his hand for
a few seconds By now his face his eyes are EXTREMELY
AGITATED

NORMAN
I have to leave now I’m sorry

ALEX
You need to hear what I have to
say We are arranging an early

Alex has an ENVELOPE in her free hand She places it on the

There is an ITCH that Norman feels around his collar bone he
scratches it violently without any awareness that he is
doing this

NORMAN
But what will Eshel do to me

ALEX
They will try to convince the court
and the public that you are an
unreliable witness That will most
likely be their defense
Norman nods his head Alex hands him the NOTICE

Norman hesitates for a brief moment then he takes the
envelope Right before he exits the room--

On Eshel’s shocked face

The camera pulls back to reveal Duby whispering into Eshel’s
ear while Eshel is sitting at the center of a room waiting
for a cabinet meeting to begin

We see Hanna standing near by holding her phone in her fist

Eshel wants to say something but in this setting he can’t
say a word He looks over at Duby Duby steps back out of
the light A SHADOW falls over Duby’ s face

BECAME SCENE A127 136

A SERIES OF SKETCHES - SUPERIMPOSED 137

Cartoons caricatures - of Norman in relation to the prime
minister under the sound of Duby’s voice

DUBY (VO)
Right now very few people know who
Norman Oppenheimer is but in a few
days everyone will want to We have
an opportunity to brand him

First caricature Norman is a rich uncle offering a lollipop
to an innocent child-like prime minister on a street corner

DUBY (VO)
To introduce him to the world in
a way that will disqualify him as
witness and at the same time paint
the prime minister as an innocent
victim

Second caricature Norman as a stray mutt latching onto the
prime minister’s leg as he tries to shake him off with an
olive branch on his way up to receiving the Nobel peace
prize

DUBY (VO)
If our leader is a victim We are
all victims

Third Caricature Norman is the sore toe on the foot of an
aching prime minister portrayed as Atlas with a globe
weighing heavily on his shoulders

ESHEL
How am I victim We are too
powerful to be victims

DUBY (VO)
Never say that It is not true

Fourth caricature A Cinderella-like situation Norman with
a devious smirk on his face trying to fit a shoe on Eshel’s
foot Eshel appearing as a delicate beautiful princess

INT PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE - NIGHT - ISRAEL 138
On Eshel’s face sitting behind his desk He looks devastated

DUBY
You are Mr Peace right now The
press will be on your side - Nobody
wants to see our peace efforts go
down the drain because of the
fantasies of some Jewish macher We
need to portray him as a delusional
name-dropper who has been sucking
your blood for years

138
DUBY (CONTD)
You need to Say this in a clear
way not only because it is
necessary but because it is true

Eshel exchanges a look with Hanna

ESHEL
There must be another way Norman
is a friend A very generous
friend I can’t hurt him

DUBY
It is not about you and him It is
much bigger than whatever personal
feelings you might have right now
And bigger than the pain it brings
on any one person

Eshel is shaking his head he needs more

DUBY (CONT’D)

Norman Oppenheimer is a threat to
our national interests

Youneed to treat him like you
would any other threat This is not
your choice It is your duty

It sinks in

SLOW DISSOLVE FROM ESHEL’S FACE TO NORMAN STANDING AT

EXT PARK AVE - NIGHT 139

Norman is standing on the median of Park Ave waiting for
the LIGHT to change He takes a deep breath

He sees A MAN ON A BIKE in the middle of the street
balancing himself on his bike with both feet on the pedals as
he waits for the light to change

The biker is in his 40s wearing a business suit tie anda
helmet on his head He is determined to stay on his bike for
the duration of the light without putting his feet down

with different sports celebrities and politicians is a
PICTURE OF ESHEL PHILIP and NORMAN taken at the Aipac
convention Finally--

PHILIP

Another beat of silence

PHILIP (CONT’D)

Norman’s eyes are fixed on the BIKER as he skillfully
maneuvers his body on the bike to keep from falling without
advancing into the busy intersection

NORMAN

reacting to something I ate I’11l

EXT SYNAGOGUE ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Norman walks around the building into the narrow alley where
there is a decorative window into the main sanctuary

Norman climbs on a garbage can and peeks through

The sight of the dimly lit empty sanctuary is comforting for
a

Norman so he just stands there with his
the window Then

MAN’S VOICE

Norman turns around It is Rabbi Blumenthal

NORMAN

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

Norman still standing on the garbage can says nothing
Rabbi Blumenthal understands what Norman’s silence means

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT’D)

He kicks the garbage can Norman falls to the ground

Rabbi Blumenthal kicks one of the garbage bags right into

Normans face

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT’D)
I should have known I should have
known not to trust you I should
have known It’s my fault What do
I do now

( )

142

Norman on the ground covered in garbage just looks at him
with nothing to say

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONTD)
Was there a donor At any point
Ever Or did you just make him up
NORMAN
I thought I had someone And I
might still have him But it is not
a sure thing

They look at each other When Norman finally tells the truth
there is something disarming about his demeanor

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Then why did you tell us you had a
donor Why would you do that

NORMAN
I don’t know

The rabbi shakes his head in despair and walks away

Norman sits himself up and leans against the wall removing
pieces of PICKLED HERRING from his coat and face

Then-- HIS PHONE RINGS

Norman locates his phone and looks at his screen ESHEL

ESHEL (CONTD)
And I am speaking to you now as
Micha Eshe not as the prime
minister of Israel
(he pauses )

I’m sorry I’m sorry for what is
about to happen to you In the next
couple of days you are going to
hear me saying things that I don’t
really believe Things about you
And it will hurt It will hurt both
of us But the only reason I will
be saying these things is because
there are hundreds of thousands of
lives at stake The enemies of
peace have decided to step all over
ou on their way to behead me It
is a terrible price to pay but
Norman I can’t let them win We
can’t let them win

SILENCE

ESHEL (CONTD)
Do you accept my apology Norman
Do you forgive me

Norman looks up to the sliver of sky that can be seen
through the two buildings on either side of the narrow alley

ESHEL (CONTD)
History is full of anonymous heroes
who helped bring civilization to
its greatest achievements While I
Micha Eshel am askin ou for
forgiveness from the Bottom of my
heart the prime minister of Israel
is eternally grateful to you for
being one of those heroes The day
I walk up to that podiumto sign
the peace treaty you will see a
very specific expression on my
face Know that I will be thinking
of you Norman Oppenheimer

There is a tense silence on both sides of the line Finally

NORMAN
I will never betray you

ESHEL
I love you Norman Thank you

Eshel hangs up
He turns to face--

DUBY who has been standing on the other side of the garden
all along

They exchange a look that says - “It’s done”

Norman nods his head But before any sentimentality settles

in-—-

BILL (CONT’D)
What have you got

NORMAN
If you knew with one hundred
percent certainty that the witness
who is threatening to topple down
rime minister Eshel will never
estify would you know how to
make money with that information

Bill is intrigued

BILL
De Spends where and how I got the
ormation and if I can verify
it You realize that you are not
a very reliable source right

NORMAN
Put me in a room with Jo Wilf Ill
