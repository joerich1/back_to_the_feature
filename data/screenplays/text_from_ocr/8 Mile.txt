BABBIT ANGSTROK

John Updike “Rabitt Run

Run it under a harsh green fluorescent light

CLOSE ON AN ANGRY BLONDE PUNK his head flying in and out of
frame Hard against SOME GIRLs face Banging against a
dirty mirror Sweating Moaning

GIRL
Jim Jim Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy oh god
Puck me Rabbit Rabbit yes oh yes
Jimmy Rabbit Fuck Fuck Fuck

Hes fucking her om top of a nasty sink Fast And furious
Her short skirt hiked up high around her waist

A wool cap pulled down tight over his face This is Jin
James B Bunny Rabbit B-Rabbit and Jimmy Smith Jr

To us hes just plain JIMMY

GIRL
Oh Rabbit fuck yes oh yes

Theyre in a desolate bathroom Wet Full of noise
Heats thumping through the walls Fists banging on the door
The girl moan-moaning Its all so fucking loud

CLOSE ON JIMMY catching sight of himself bouncing up and down
in the mirror Ignoring the girl hes somewhere else
Gone Always movine We hear her coming Jimmy stops
Stares The harsh light crowns his head a burning halo

He doesnt look so good cold sweat

JIMMY
- I gotta run

She jumps off the sink yanks down her skirt

GIRL
(pissed)

JIMMY
(pulls up his pants
dist racted)
- What Wasnt it good for you

GIRL

Before Jimmy can answer a queer look crosses his face--
He rushes for a dirty stall and
we hear him puking his fucking brains out

Jimny leaving the bathroom Still a little green

Wo sign of the girl A line of guys waiting outside

They scream shout Jimmy just laughs and gives ‘em all the
finger Heads down the corridor alone into the darkness

An underground hip-hop club THE SHELTER A basement cave
You can see the noise and the heat Wall-to-wall kids all
that sex Mashing to the beat Mostly black Some white
Whatever Jinmy wipes his mouth slips on headphones
getting back into character We hear his misic the song
being pumped into his head Angry Dsfiant Beautiful

He makes his way through cue crowd a hip-hop gladiator
Walking tall All attitude Everybody around him dancing to
a different beat Were sampling Tony Manero strutting down
the block from the opening of SATURDAY NIGHT PEVER

Jimmy (Tony) checks out the girls smiles their way heading
backstage But this aint no fucking disco

Before he gets far some BIG BAD DUDE stops him--

Shines a flashlight in his face Hollas some shit at him
Jimmy tears off his headphones The song cuts out--

SLAM TO
MAIN TITLE

fight
music

We still hear the scratching which leads us into our title
song the song we first heard playing in Jimmys headphones

Te

Poor Detroit Jimtuy runs through the diseased streets of his
life past all the crack whores and dead ends Holding onto
his garbage bag full of clothes headphones back on his head
His breath visible in the night air He and it the only
white around We still hear our title song

Jimmy runs Runs through a busy intersection right on by
the entrance of a ratty trailer park running down a side
street Running up te a big vacant field down at the end
Urban blight Dying grass A graveyard for shopping carts
broken appliances used needles « other shit

Jimmy stops
And screams out at the top of his lungs
Loud and long

Then he runs to a chain link fence at the edge of the field
looks both ways making sure no one sees him and hops over it

Jimmy makes his way through the maze of trailers Up to a
drab double-wide mobile home A beat-to-shit big-ass 79
Lincoln abandoned in front Down And out

3

Jimmy lets himself in Drops the garbage bag Hes cold
blowing on his hands trying to warm himself up The place is
a dump All white trash
The title song still blaring in his headphones and on our
soundtrack

JIMMY
Mom

He heads for his moms bedroom As he gets closer we hear
Bome noise Moans And grunts A breathless scream

We hear sex Raw And loud

Not Jimmy All he hears is music

JIMMY
Mom

He slides open the flimsy vinyl bedroom door and sees his mom
fucking some guy On top Riding away--
Jinmy pulls off his headphones The title song ends

CIMMY
(in shock)
Mom
STEPHANIE
Rabbit

Later Jimmys eating cereal in the lousy kitchen dry no
milk A small TV beer bottles and comic books Litter the
countertops A rusty electric space heater vibrates heat
Its almost quiet far the first time in the movie

His mother STEPHANIE slinks in wearing an oversized
Osborne High sweatshirt and little else Her hairs a sex
mess she slurs her words a little maybe a little drunk
Shes a young 40 small and sexy in that bleached blonde
trailer trash sorta way

STEPHANTE

A thick lame white dude GREG MINOR stumbles into the
Kitchen on one good leg like he owns the place Just a few
yeurs older than Jimmy all Gregs got on is a two-day beard
pair of Osborne High sweatpants and a shit-eatin’ grin

GREG
slaps Jimmy on the
back of His head)
Rabbit - what the fuck you doin

Jimuy doesnt react Too tired to fight Its clear that
Greg makes him uncomfortable Makes him feel like hes back
in high scheol Jimmy seems to shrink when hes around

JIMMY

Janeane an I broke up -

STEPHANIE

Without skipping a beat Jimmy grabs a beer bottle and fires it
at Gregs head It just misses smashing against the wall--
Greg bolts up cigarette still stuck in his mouth--

Jimmy instinctively takes a step back

Violence about to break

Stephanie jumps in the middle--

STEPHANIE
screams at Jimmy)

dust then a sleepy little angel appears in the doorway of the
kitchen six-year-old LILY Jimmys little half-sister

A mountain of stuffed animals on her bed As he puts her

Jimmy on the bus looking out the window Poverty Hard
times and pain He slips on his headphones pulls out a pen
and starts writing on his dirty hand

CLOSE ON JIMMYS HAND letters

Words

Rhymes

CLOSE ON JIMMYS FACE closing his eyes

And we hear the opening lines to the song a cappella
And then a beat kicks in the bass line and a groove
And as the words and music come together in a song
Jimmys set free He opens hig eyes

The bus the poor Detroit its all ANIMATED By and Crumb
Aud Jimmy hes a Superman Costume muscles the whole desl
SUPERIJIMMY Hes rapping the song for all to hear Jumps up
and burats through the window of the bus flying away for good
Escaping his earthly bonds « dull reality

SuperJimmy flying and rapping over the animated bad streets of
Detroit heading up toward the sun leaving the earth behind
flying Icarue high He flies up up around and around the globe
faster and faster A blur Going BACK IN TIME to last night

LAST NIGHT SuperJimmy flies onstage in the Shelter grabs
the mic from LIL TIc with one hand and with the other squeeres
Tics animated head right off Blood gushing everywhere as
SuperJimgy just freestyles cool to the crowd

The rhymes and the blood flowing fast The audience applauds
ecreaming - going crazy - loving all of SuperdJimmy and his

music He finishes and waves goodbye flying off BACK INTO THE
FUTURE heading for the suburbs and the nice part of town

TODAY The nice part of town Superdimmy flies over a five-
star hotel Up-scale grand Still singing his sang

He darts down toward the back of the botel and heads through
a big open window flying into a locker room in the basement

He dives at a locker changing super fast out of his costume
And into his uniform
Shirt Tie Veat

Becoming JIMMY THE HELLMAN BACK TO REALITY (film)
He takes off his headphones glancing at his reflection in a
locker room mirror the song cutting out--

And we hear a more upbeat jazzy version of our opening title
song

Jimmy and Alex walking in the rain sharing an umbrella
Heading for a crowded bus stop Bright headlights
intermittently cut the darkness

Jimmys lost in his own world

We still hear the song

A car drives by and splashes a puddle all over Jimny

We hear the sonq

They make their way down the street jumping and kicking water
back and forth at each other

And Jimmy starts singin in the rain just singin’ in the
rain Showing off for Alex Trying to impress her
Singing along to the song

Splashing in puddles Playing with the umbrella

Headphones on White out You cant see any trash

Its almost beautiful Otherworldly And SILENT

All we hear is Love Reign G‘er Me in Jimmys head

Jimmy closes his eyes and screams
But we dont hear it only the song
He screams loud and long

Screams his fucking heart out

He opens his eyes and
sees a giant shape emerge from the fog

Its a HORSE

A big brown horse
Jimmy cant believe its real

The horse looks at him and then begins to graze in the field
Another horse appears from the fog

And then another

And another One of them has a blue blanket on DETROIT
MOUNTED POLICE

Jimmy stands there With the horses sporting and pulling up
dead grass in the fog

Jimmy takes off his headphones SOURD comes rushing in
The song fades away He hears police sirens off in the
distance Jimmy walks up te the big brown horse

It looks back up at him

Jimmys now face to face with the horse The horse goes back
to grazing Jimmy rubs its head The police sirens getting
closer Darkness closing in

Jimmy just keeps patting the horses head
The songs playing
The sirens wailing
BE

Jimmy says goodbye to the Future and takes off running down
the street On his own

Away from his friends

Away from the crowd

Away from the club

Running by himself down the dirty streets of Detroit
Heading in the opposite direction of everybody else
Sweet wind licks his face Cold breath slips his mouth
We hear our closing credit song

and the scene beings to ANIMATE
But this time he isnt a superhero flying up in the sky
This time hes just plain Jimmy Running

A little smile comes to Jimmys face
He runs feet solid on the ground
Faster

Lighter

Free

He runs Jimmy runs
