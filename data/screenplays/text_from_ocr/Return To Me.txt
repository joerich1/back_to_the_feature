A WHITE SCREEN
We sense this is someones POV The WHITE
slowly disperses as hints of BLUE SKY peek
through We are DESCENDING through the CLOUDS
as the evening sunset weaves a blanket of
orange and red hues over a LARGE CITY which
slowly comes INTO FOCUS
Floating HIGH ABOVE the peaks and valleys of
CHICAGOS SKYLINE as if being mysteriously
moved to a letter on a Ouija Board WE ARE
DRAWN to an unfinished STEEL-FRAMED
SKYSCRAPER The hum of the construction work
below fills our ears Gradually WE CLOSE IN
on a small yellow dot that dances on one of
the exposed beams CLOSER STILL Just as
the detailed creases of a yellow hard hat
become evident it tilts OUT OF FRAME as the
face of the MAN wearing it looks up into the
sky
BOB

roofs on em
This is Bob BOB RUELAND late thirties a
confident handsome man with a magnetic
personality He walks along the high beams
with ease as he makes his way to the service

in

INT PRIMATE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
A dark cavernous building painted to look
like a jungle The excitement of the

Bob lets the door close behind him shutting
the sunlight out as he slowly enters this
very familiar territory He walks over to the
enclosed
GORILLA HABITAT
SYDNEY is sitting in the corner facing the
wall ignoring everyone
Displayed at the front of the exhibit are
small PHOTOGRAPHS and a brief history of each
gorilla Bob looks over the different photos
stopping at the one on Sydney
Sydneys bio reads SYDNEY FIFTEEN YEARS

Bob looks up observing the CHILDREN trying to
say hello to Sydney He brushes his fingers
over Katherines name on the display turns
and leaves
Just as Bob reaches for the door it is pulled
open by Megan ushering the kids in The
sunlight temporarily blinds Bob who quickly
averts his eyes As he reaches for his
sunglasses
Grace and Tommy enter passing Bob as he puts
on his sunglasses Bob and Grace are so
close
Bob slightly brushes against Graces arm as he
passes her Grace sighs and lightly touches
her heart She squeezes a little tighter onto
Tommys hand

TOMMY

EXT LINCOLN PARK ZOO - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER
The rain has stopped Bob lost in thought
leans on the stone railing that lines the
gleaming wet path on the bridge eating his
ravioli out of the styrofoam container with a
plastic fork He taps his breast pocket for
the letter still there He slowly takes it
half way out then puts it back He finishes
eating Stops breathes in the night air
Leaning on the rail he looks out over the
river and up at the Chicago sky line
He feels the letter in his chest pocket
reaches into the jacket and pulls out the worn
pale pink envelope
He carefully opens it
CLOSE-UP BOB
As he reads his face reflects the emotional
content of the letter
OVER BOBS SHOULDER
we see the feminine hand writing

DISSOLVE

CLOSE-UP OF GRACES HAND
as she writes
I hope this letter will bring some
comfort
PULL BACK revealing Grace in her hospital
bed just weeks after the transplant She is
sitting up thoughtfully composing the letter
on her bedside table as little Bridgette lies
beside her coloring Megan is busy adding
water to the flowers on the nightstand
The door opens and a NURSE enters the room
Grace immediately pulls the blanket over to
hide Bridgette who continues to color beneath
the blanket as the nurse takes Graces blood
pressure The nurse finishes and exits
Bridgette pops out from under the blanket
Grace continues writing
CLOSE-UP OF GRACES HAND
as she writes the following
your thoughtfulness in a moment of such
deep sorrow
BACK ON BOB
I awake each day feeling the gentle rhythm
of the heart that beats inside me
Bob flips the letter over to look on the back
no signature Looking up at the stars he
slowly folds the letter as we

Now Robert this is none of
my business I know what
has happened is
overwhelming and you need
time to sort it all out
But in your

sorting just know that
when I prayed and prayed
for Grace to get

another chance at life I
knew that if God blessed
us the heart would

have to be from someone
very special if its to be
at home in

who are now

Bobs shoulderstands to leave

with you always

thoughts
As Bob looks up at the habitat Sydney is
sitting in the Oak tree staring at him Bob
does the sign for Hi Sydney signs
something back Bobs not sure what Sydney
repeats the sign Bob gets up and goes to a
DISPLAY illustrating the proper sign for
each LETTER OF THE ALPHABET
He looks up at Sydney who impatiently signs
the same message Bob looks to the board and

matches the first letter G He looks to
Sydney who hits his chest and signs again
Bob glances down to the board O
