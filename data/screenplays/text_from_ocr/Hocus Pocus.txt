FADE IN
EXT SALEM VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

The CAMERA LOOKS DOWN ON the village nestled in the
valley below Simple wood- framed houses Smoking
chimneys Lighted windows The night is chilly thick
spooky The DOGS of the village are heard BARKING and
HOWLING upset by something that they understand even
if we dont

LETTERS READ Salem Massachusetts 1692

Under a full moon a spooky-looking high-eaved little
house glowers down at the village from the top of a hill
‘Smoke rises up out of its chimney twisting and turning
in a very unnatural fashion This is no ordinary smoke

and this is no ordinary house

The CAMERA FINDS something moving through the bushes just
below the house and FOLLOWS the source of the motion
Suddenly the shivering bushes part and two heads
appear They belong to a pair of local farm children
THACKERY and ELIJAH BINX Thackery thirteen is the
older Elijah his brother is ten Both wear homespun
simple clothing They peer up at the house frightened

THACKERY
They conjure Look

He points at the chimney smoke in which the shapes of
little demons and beasts can be seen forming and unform-
ing in the vapors Elijah is really scared Thackery
starts crawling toward the house

ELIJAH
Thackery

But he follows him

CAMERA FOLLOWS the two children as they crawl through

the bramble-filled yard toward the lighted windows of the
spooky-looking house They reach the window and peer in

THEIR POV

The main room of the house is lit only by the fire in the
broad hearth and by candles placed in a circle around the
room The CAULDRON BOILS on the fire as the three
Sanderson sisters WINIFRED MARY and SARAH stand around
it Very old and dressed in the heavy black woolen
clothing of the era they look like exactly what they
are witches

Winifred is the eldest and by far the most powerful

O)

Once beautiful her beauty has been corrupted by evil
(her fingers have grown talons her teeth have
sharpened) but she is still vain and she hates
children for their youth and prettiness

Winifred has a nasty temper when she gets really angry
her -hair stands on end and she possesses an ability to
discharge jolts of electrical energy Winifred has great
skill with potions and spells She is a very dangerous
witch

Mary the middle sister is obese and gluttonous
Obsessed with food she possesses the outward manner of a
Sweet as sugar kindly aunt Mary loves little children
She loves them because she loves to eat them Marys
sense of smell is incredibly keen she can follow the
scent of a child like a bloodhound

Sarah the youngest is the idiot sister Shes also
beautiful and sexy She likes to torture things small
animals children bugs you name it Any suggestion of
cruelty (to somebody else) sends her into a fit of idiotic
cackling laughter while any fear for herself sends her
into a fit of terrified screaming Shes a mess

The children watch as Winifred reads from the recipe in
her ancient spell book

WINIFRED
(reading)
Oil of boil
(puts in a drop)
And a dead mans toe

Drops one in Suddenly Sarahs nose catches a whiff of
Something She sniffs

SARAH
I smell
(licks her lips)
Children

BACK TO SCENE

Thackery and Elijah duck for cover as Sarah Winifred
and Mary step up to the window and gaze out

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE

Thackery and Elijah hide right below them motionless
as Sarah sniffs and Winifreds evil eyes scan the

darkness for their favorite prey children

C) Suddenly a ghostly white form can be seen approaching
Ne through the darkness

WINIFRED
Sisters our guest is here

The witches share an evil laugh of pleasure and move back
into the room The kids are terrified as the white form
approaches and becomes identifiable as a LITTLE GIRL
dressed in a long white night shirt
ELIJAH
(in a whisper)
Tis our sister Emily

The Little Girls eyes are closed She is walking in her
sleep

THACKERY
(in a whisper)
Emily Emily
But she walks right past them and into the house

ELIJAH
x She is bewitched

THACKERY

Run to town Fetch the elders
ELIJAH

But --
THACKERY

Go Elijah Run like the wind
Elijah crawls away then gets to his feet and sprints
off down the hill toward the village
BACK IN HOUSE - MOMENT LATER

Emily sits on a stool next to the bubbling cauldron
Winifred continues reading from her spell book

WINIFRED
Finally when tis nearly done
Add a bit of thy own tongue

CLOSE ON WINIFRED

as she bites her own tongue then spits into the
cauldron

CLOSE ON CAULDRON

as it bubbles up changing to a dark sickly purple color
and giving off a menacing curl of vapor

WINIFRED
Tis ready for tasting

Mary is about to take a taste but Winifred gives her a
painful backhand knocking her away from it She dips a

Spoon into the potion then holds the steaming spoon out

to Emily

WINIFRED
One drop of this and her life
will be mine

The witches cackle The entranced little girl opens her
mouth wide as Winifred leans in with the spoon But
suddenly the door to the house flies open and Thackery
races in

SARAH
A boy

Thackery flings a stool at Winifred she jumps clear
flicking the contents of the spoon on Mary whom it
SIZZLES Thackery grabs a long iron pot hook off the
wall He swings it at the witches who recoil from
him Winifred snatches up her spell book and holds it
protectively

- WINIFRED
Get him you fools

MARY
Get him you fool

Mary shoves Sarah at Thackery and Thackery gives her a

good bopon the head

As Winifred getting furious starts gathering power for
a major electrical discharge Thackery hooks the edge of
the cauldron with the pot hook and dumps it over The
BUBBLING GOO spills all over the dirt floor

ON WINIFRED

as she shrieks in rage at the sight of her ruined potion

Her hair is now standing out straight in the air

Thackery bolts for the door but Winifred nails him with
a massive jolt of electricity and he goes down
THACKERYS POV - FROM FLOOR - MOMENT LATER

() as he comes to and sees the witches three ugly faces
staring DOWN AT him

BACK TO SCENE
Thackery tries to struggle but theyve tied him up

MARY
See how bravely he struggles

They cackle

WINIFRED
What shall we do with him
sisters

MARY
Roast him with potatoes

SARAH
Put hornets in his ears

WINIFRED
No no hes such a brave little
boy -his punishment must be more
o inventive Lets find
something in my book

She pets the book

SARAH
The book The book

Sarah and Mary cackle with glee as Winifred lovingly
opens and peruses her spell book

WINIFRED
Let me see Warts Itching
Crib death --

MARY
(gleefully)

WINIFRED
(smacks her)
I have it His punishment will
not be to die ‘but to live
forever

- MARY
WO (cackling)

As what Winnie

Crib death crib “death

SARAH
As what As what

Winifred reads from the book
WINIFRED
Twist the bones and bend the back
Trim him of his baby fat
Give him fur as black as black
And pointy claws with which to spat

Winifred hisses at him

THACKERYS POV OF WITCHES

DROPS TO the floor The witches poke cruelly AT CAMERA

with their broomsticks The door flies open
fills the house

EXT SALEM VILLAGE - NIGHT

The witches are set to be hanged over a pyre
Elijah stand with their FATHER

FATHER BINX
Confess your crimes Where be the
boy Thackery Binx

MARY
We are innocent

SARAH
Victims we are Let this madness
stop No last meal

FATHER BINX

WINIFRED
Mortal ignorant fools Hang us
burn us what ye will But our
spirits abide here in this hill
that one Hallowd Eve when the
moon is round a virgin will
summon us from the ground

The townspeople toss torches to pyre Flames leap at the

CAMERA PANS UP TO AND HOLDS ON the full moon as the
WITCHES SHRIEK WITH LAUGHTER But their shrieking is
suddenly cut short as we hear the PLANK TUMBLE to
the ground

DISSOLVE TO

ANOTHER ANGLE
Nearby something small and sad watches from the bushes

Watery marble eyes blink slowly When they open theyre
looking up at

WILLIAMSON (15 prettiest girl in town) and BEN and ALAN

MISS OLIN
Could anyone explain for us how
the cultural significance of
Halloween and our own local
history might perhaps share some
common ground

A tarantula secretly crawls among the feet of the

about it so Alan diverts the class

MISS OLIN

most improperly dumped-on witch
hunters swore theyd come back
to avenge themselves on Salems
children that would be us

There are those to this day Mr
Corwin and myself included who
believe that every Halloween night
a black cat still guards the old
Sanderson house warning off any
who might bring the witches back
from the grave

ALLISON

ALLISON
My friends and me used to sneak

we were little and play Ouija
board and stuff but it was
never like this its weird now

The displays are cobwebbed Rainwater catch-buckets
Velvet ropes form a guided tour past display signs
potions strange devices dried animals and the
cauldron The gang screams

ALLISON
Oh my God I forgot about those

Wax witch effigies wearing talisman necklaces Theyre
huddled oer the cauldron Max ventures forward Dani
clings to his arm -- he wrenches free

MAX
The spellbook of Winifred
Sanderson Given to her by the
Devil himself Bound in human
skin it contains the recipes for
spells of destruction and life
-Human ‘skin right

ALLISON
Unless you believe in this stuff
it seems goofy

Max feels his oats here he aint afraid of nothin

MAX
Definitely Check this out

The black candle display A box of old matches nearby

MAX
The Candle of the Black Flame
Made from the tallow of a still
born calf -- gross -- and the fat
of a hanged man -- no way -- This
candle was used by --

The mini-mag dies he strikes a wooden match

MAX

-- the sisters to illuminate the

pages of the spellbook while they
conjured Legend has it that it

will also raise the dead when lit
by a virgin on Halloween night

(beat macho)
Guess Im out then
( )

ALLISON
Oh right

DANI
Thats what she meant

Meant who what

ALLISON
Before they hanged her Winifred
Sanderson cast one last spell One
Halloween night when the moon is
‘round a virgin will summon us from
the ground’

In the bg through the window the clouds drift away
revealing the full round moon The room is suddenly
illuminated with moonlight Its very spooky Allison
and Dani are afraid

MAX
Cool Lets light the thing and
meet the hags
(offering Alison his
lighter)
Would you like to do the honors

ALLISON
We shouldnt be fooling around
with this

DANI
No kidding

MAX

What are you afraid of Its all
just a bunch of hocus pocus

Suddenly with a PANTHER-LIKE YOWL the BLACK CAT leaps
out of the darkness and lands on Maxs back For a moment
it hangs on clawing him viciously

MAX
(freaked)
Get him off Get him off me
Ahhhhh

As suddenly as it attacked the cat drops off of Max and
disappears into the shadows Allison nervously laughs at
Maxs freaked out state Max embarrassed picks up a
piece of firewood and brandishes it like a weapon

MAX

Stupid cat
( )

C) Sneezes From the shadows a very HUMAN-LIKE CAT YOWLING
ed can be heard

ALLISON
He says thats what you get for
hitting him with a rock -- Oh my
God I can hear him now too

MAX
What

ALLISON
He talks

DANI
I told you

More YOWLING from the shadows

ALLISON
He says if we dont get out of
here right now well never get
out

MAX
So why cant I hear him
More YOWLING

DANI
Only those who believe in magic
can hear him speak

MAX
You guys are overreacting

ALLISON

- DANI
Great idea

They start for the window

MAX
Wait a second wheres your candy

DANI
Who cares

a Forget it Max Lets go

MAX

Allison helps him look The CAT MEOWS at them
menacingly

MAX
Shut up Morris

Sneezes The moon slips behind the clouds again
darkening the room Max flicks his lighter lit

ALLISON
I cant see a thing Lets just
‘ split

Max looks at the black flame candle Without thinking
he lights it Dani sees him

DANI
Max No

The CAT YOWLS in horror But its too late

CLOSE ON CANDLE

as Maxs lighter ignites the flame but instead of giving

off light the flame literally sucks in the light around
it like a black hole

ON MAXS REACTION
as he realizes hes just made the blunder of his life

MAX
Uh-oh

But its too late With a sudden IMPLOSIONEXPLOSION
all the light in the room is sucked into the candle
while at» the same time a strange HOWLING WIND emanates
out of the flame and blows around the room Hellish
LAUGHTER and SCREAMING are heard as the WIND GUSTS
blowing around dust and objects

CAT
Oh no

of the witches in streams up through the floorboards

lighting them from the inside out Melting the wax

CAT
No no no

The EFFIGIES MOAN like the undead Wax drops off them in
luminous thick lugies The PLASTER EXPLODES from the
mannequins Waxy plaster dust fills the room Moonlight
filtered in the trillion particles clears slowly The
kids duck behind the spellbook display They stare and
shudder at what has impossibly manifest before them

SANDERSON SISTERS

skinny fat and ugly Unchanged and pissed They are
slow to realize their good fortune As they pinch
themselves to verify their freshliness

WINIFRED

WINIFRED
But who brought us back

The witches scan the room and see the three witch
effigies Winifred approaches them

C WINIFRED

She puts her hand on one and it falls over Winifred
examines them puzzled Suddenly Sarahs nose starts
twitching

MARY

Winifred whacks Mary with the back of her hand sending
her slamming into a rack of potions Winifred turns on
the charm

WINIFRED
“s Come out my dears We will not
a harm you

We love children

Winifred suddenly flips over the table revealing Dani
who is petrified Dressed as a witch she thinks fast
and pretends to be one

DANI

WINIFRED
Greetings little one

DANI
It was I who brought you back

WINIFRED

The three witches gather closely around her pawing and
poking her with their sharp fingers

SARAH

The witches howl with evil laughter and seize Dani with

their talon-like hands

pieces when a voice shouts

VOICE (0S)
Hey

They are about to tear her to

The witches turn and see Max holding one of the
buckets of rainwater He hurls the water scoring a
direct hit on Winifred and soaking her thoroughly
Everything stops as everyone looks at Winifred to see
what happens

CLOSE ON WINIFRED

as she gets so mad that the WATER literally SIZZLES off
her face

MAX
(sheepishly)
It worked in i

Back to Winifred as her rage increases her electricity
charges up her hair stands straight on end Suddenly
she throws out her hands and zaps Max with a stream of
CRACKLING ELECTRICAL ENERGY

Mary and Sarah cackle with delight as Max is literally
lifted off the ground writhing in the electrical field

SARAH
Burn him to a cinder

MARY
Roast him Winnie

Now Dani gets mad

DANI
Youleave my brother alone

She picks up a small pot and beans Winifred with it The
electrical charge is broken Max slumps to the ground
and Winifred goes down to the floor momentarily stunned

‘but in an instant she has regained her’ senses She

snatches up Dani with both hands and lifts her off the
ground-

When Allison attacks her but Winifred easily knocks her
aside with a blow from her hand Winifred is about to
wring Danis neck

When suddenly there is a ferocious YOWL and the black
CAT leaps out from its hiding place high on a shelf and
lands on Winifreds head scratching and clawing her
savagely Winifred releases Dani and all hell breaks
loose

Mary tries to grab Allison who punches her in the nose
Winifred tears the cat off her and throws it against the
wall Max comes to his senses sees whats happening
then spots the sprinkler system on the ceiling Mary
cackles like an idiot

MARY
Here kitty kitty kitty

Dani finds her candy bag Winifred is about to grab her
again when Max suddenly leaps up on the table

MAX
Hey

He clicks the lighter which flames That catches the
witches’ attention

MAX
You have messed with the Great and
Powerful Max and must now suffer
the consequences I summon the
Burning Rain of Death

Max (who has positioned himself perfectly) lifts his hand
and holds the flame under an old sprinkler head on the
ceiling

For a beat nothing happens and then an old FIRE ALARM
BELL starts SOUNDING and all the SPRINKLER HEADS on the
ceiling start gushing water

The witches scream in horror as they imagine they are
about to die an agonizing death

SARAH
The Burning Rain of Death

Screams While the kids scramble to escape the black
cat who is of course Thackery Binx leaps up onto Maxs
shoulder putting his face right upto Maxs Three
hundred years have turned Binx into a tough very worldly
cat

BINX

Max instinctively reaches to pry the cat off -- Binx
bites his hand
MAX
Oh God youtalk

after he was strung up The
witches stole his body from the
gallows and brought him back to
life to raise a little hell if
ya knowwhat I mean To keep
their secrets they cut out his
tongue and sewed his mouth shut
with a dull needle

The kids react -- hands to lips Stark silence

INT SANDERSON HOUSE - NIGHT

The place

is wrecked Winifred whistles -- a classic

twig broom flies to her Sarah whistles -- a modern-
type nylon-bristle angle broom skitters over to her

(NOTE When she flies then her broom is always out of
alignment -- she flies at an angle) Mary whistles --
a 30-year-old chrome-railed Electrolux vacuum chugs out
of the closet to her and

« unceremoniously slaps her in the forehead with its
chrome handle With an impressive flurry of cape
Winifred mounts her broom

EXT SKY ABOVE SLAEM - WITCHES AIRBORNE - NIGHT

The witches fly across the full moon They consider

Salem Village far below The city lights seem like

pyres

WINIFRED
Salem Village is a changed world
Many witches burning regular now

BACK AT GRAVEYARD - FEW MOMENTS LATER

Dani and Allison listen intently as Binx tells his tale
Max is still feeling peeved

DANI
Do you like being a cat a lot

BINX
At first I enjoyed myself Being
a cat was a highly sensuous
experience I slept all day
prowled around at night My
family took me in I slept by the
fire and everybody petted me
But then the years started to
pass I watched my parents grow
old and die and my brothers and
sisters And their children
and their children But I was
always left behind

The kids are stunned and saddened

MAX

Why didnt you kill yourself
BINX

Dont you think I tried
(MORE )

ao

ALL nod

BINX (CONTD)

But I always survived I feel
into deep despair I couldnt die
but I had no reason to live Then
one day I realized Immortality
was a curse but it gave me a
purpose The Sanderson sisters
had vowed to return from the grave
but Id always be here to stop
them Theyd never harm another
child as long as I was here So
for three centuries Ive guarded
that house especially on Halloween
night

(pointedly at Max)
When I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle

ALLISON
Whatre we gonna do
BINX
Make sure the hags dont get the
spellbook
MAX
This
BINX

Yes that The devils spellbook

It contains all of witch Winifreds

most powerful and heinous spells
(to Max)

Dont let it out of your sight

and remember this all of you it

is evil and only evil can come of

it Is that clear

BINX
Good

DANI
They did magic at their house how
come they need it

BINX
Good point As near as I can
figure they have minor magic
at their beck and call Ya

Suddenly an electric cord drops dangles from the sky in
front of Max Binx looks skyward
BINX
Bad
WINIFRED
Book be mine
The spellbook leaps
BINX
Get it
Max intercepts Allison and Danitake cover -- hide

ALLISON
If they get it back what would
they do with it

BINX
I only saw them conjure with it
once Theyd cooked a potion that
as near as I could ever figure
out they planned to give to the
children of Salem Village

For what

BINX -
I dont know

MAX
Well were just talking about
three old ladies versus the 20th
century right I mean how bad
could it be

‘their -eyes Binx leaps to the tombstone

BINX
This is hallowed ground Whisk
off wretched hags

WINIFRED
Thackery Binx My my still

Electrolux zooms inches above

Winifred and her sister air-huddle

BINX

BINX
‘They’ cannot

ALLISON
Whadda you mean they

Winifred unpockets the black flame candle
ready

WINIFRED

Souls at peace remain at rest
Tortured spirit join our quest
Smell with nose see with eye
Twist your fingers toward the sky
Push aside your earthen sheet
Stand upon your good dead feet
Life is sweet be not shy-sleeping
slave arise Arise (

Holds it

Winifred snaps her craggy fingers and lights the candle
Binx is thrown off William Butchers tombstone -- the
gravemarker rolls Rotted coffin planks erupt from the
grave Then

- BILLY THE BUTCHER climbs out A zombie His mouth
Sewn shut He blinks the dirt from his eyes -- which are
somehow miraculously intact Nothing else about him is
though Dani Allison and Max are struck dumb and
frozen stiff Binx leaps onto Maxs chest once more

BINX
Hey
(slap-slap)
Ever see ight
Dead

(as Max nods)
Well its all true Zombies eat
people Were gone like the wind
Follow me

WINIFRED

After the children

Billy moves onAllison and Dani who run after Binx making
tracks out of the graveyard

MAX
But you said we cant leave the
cemetery

BINX
Fine fine You stay here then

Billy growls Max splits Billy runs into a low branch
-- knocks his head off -- fumbles around for his noggin
Finds it Sets it back Chases on The kids sprint for
the cemetery wall Billy closes Suddenly the witches —
appear -- hovering right in front of them

WINIFRED
Peek-a-boo we see you Give me
the book

Binx barrels headlong toward the witches

BINX
This way

With total trust Dani and Allison run after Binx Max
slows a bit -- skeptical Mary hovers lowest hands out
ready to catch Binx

( )

O

MARY
Here kitty kitty

Binx leaps right into Marys waiting hands No He
soars over her and disappears into a bramble patch
along the wall Dani and Allison follow him -- sliding
under Mary whos looked after Binx -- into the bushes
and vanish as well

Max sees the escape -- runs faster Suddenly Sarah is
hovering in front of him -- he looks back -- Billys
right on top of him As Billys bony phalanges reach
for him Max screams dashes forward and

SARAH
Come to momma you fresh young
thing

rips a momentous slide under Sarah and vanishes
into the bush patch Billy plows full-body into Sarah
knocking her into a dizzying series of crazy aerial
loops

Billy recovers and tears away bushes He rips at them
so hard his arm comes flying off on the back-rip He
runs to get it revealing that hes uncovered a large

hole in the ground

WINIFRED
Damnable child Damn Thackery
Binx Damn him to the dogs for
eternity

SARAH
It was your idea to turn him into
a cat Winnie

WINIFRED
Sister puncture thyself and let
the air out of thy brain
(to Billy)
Down the hole After them rotting
beast Bring them to me dead or
dead

Billy crawls down the hole
Mary air-tumbles back to her sisters -- shes dizzy and

disheveled Just as she takes a deep breath -- her
nose tears her off in some direction

MARY
Sisters I have a bearing This
