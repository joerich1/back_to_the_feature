BURIED

Zippo

Written by

Chris Sparling

FADE IN
INT UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT

Darkness Silence After a long beat we hear movement
confined and contained

We then hear the sound of a man PAUL CONROY groaning
making confused attempts at words We hear his movement
short abrupt shifting ending almost immediately with the
sound of his body banging against wood

He screams though its clear from the sound that his mouth
is covered by something

After attempting to sit up he immediately bangs his head
against something Its terribly warm and his breaths are
labored

He attempts to move to his left and right only to find that
he is confined on those sides as well He frantically
shifts about only to discover by touch that he is encased
in something

Something is very wrong and he doesnt need to see to know
that

Finally we see him lit by the flame of the Zippo he holds
in his hands which are bound together in front of him with
rope A rolled-up dirty rag is tied tightly around his
head stretched across his mouth Dried blood stains his
hair and forehead

We see that he is lying in an old fashioned wooden coffin
Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed
together Realizing the same Paul is struck by an
overwhelming instant panic

With great difficulty and while still holding the lit

Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth

PAUL
What What is this
His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about
though fear is understood in his every utterance
the

American

He screams aloud but his voice is captured by the coffin
walls

PAUL
Oh my God Help me Help me
He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of

coffin all to no avail His violent movements cause small
grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the
sides and top of the coffin as well as a small gap that
exists between one of the coffins broken wooden planks
Sweat cascades down the side of his neck dripping from his
dampened brow The heat inside the extremely close confines
of the coffin is stifling

PAUL (CONTD)
Somebody help me Please
Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of
the coffin The sides the top the bottom -- all are too
thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the
coffin Sand It becomes clear to him that he is buried
He tries his best to calm himself though he has trouble
catching his breath It takes him some time but he
eventually achieves some semblance of calm
Getting a good look at him for the first time we see that
Paul is somewhere around 37 years old Unshaven and
physically unremarkable he embodies the blue-collar

everyman
He coughs The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes
it hard for him to breathe

His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed rusty nail He
tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old
frayed ropes that bind his hands Doing so is no easy task
The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly
impossible
After a lengthy struggle the rope snaps Paul quickly frees
his hands A small victory Very small

The heat is unbearable Paul takes off his button-down
shirt leaving him in a T-shirt His body battles against
the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he
makes
He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet His
undershirt is drenched through with sweat

Still trying to calm himself but having little success in
doing so Paul looks around the coffin His feet though

feet

theres

softened

only his body-length away seem miles from him

He looks at the top of the coffin and then back at his

With great difficulty he shifts his body so that his feet
are pressed against the top of the coffin He attempts to
use his leg strength to push the top off of him but it
doesnt move even a millimeter

After several failed attempts and with his legs exhausted
Paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin He lay for a
moment in silence followed by an outburst of crying

Close to his head on the corner of the floor we see

another broken plank A small hole
He closes his cigarette lighter extinguishing the flame In
total darkness he continues to cry

PAUL (CONTD)
What is this
With his sobbing slowly subsiding the coffin soon grows
eerily silent
The sound of Pauls labored breaths are all we hear

under the blanket of absolute darkness

After a beat the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing
sound The muted sight of strange blueish light flickers in
the coffin by Pauls feet He is extremely startled

The buzzing continues as does the minimal splashing of
light Its coming from underneath his discarded button-down
shirt down near his feet

He lights the Zippo to get a better look

Pulling the shirt away he realizes that what he is hearing
and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an
older model cell phone

He frantically reaches for it though the coffin is far too
small for him to reposition himself so easily

To his dismay the phone stops ringing But his efforts to
reach it continue He uses his feet to search for the phone
After some trouble finding it he eventually locates it
Clamping the phone together between his clasped feet Paul
then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet
with his hands and grab it

He is soon able to reach it Immediately thereafter he
words

against

for

flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him

We see that there is a Text Message waiting for Paul on the
phone However Paul barely notices

The time on the phone reads 612pm While the numbers and
display screen icons are familiar to Americans all the

re in Arabic

hat he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of
ignal strength Worse yet there is only half of the

attery life remaining

e tries to remember the Safe Number he was given With the
hone open and ready to be dialed Paul struggles to recall
he information

toOrtONns

PAUL (CONTD)
Come on come on What was it

Getting only two digits into dialing the number he cannot
remember much more and closes the phone
He wedges the lit Zippo into sand which is compacted

a small hole in the wall of the coffin
Paul reaches into his pants pocket frantically searching

something He hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and
a small metal flask Both are not what he was looking for
He then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet
Its empty His license his credit cards his cash and
most importantly at that very moment a piece of paper with
the Safe Number written on it are all missing

PAUL (CONTD)
No Where the hell is it Son of
aCome on

He screams aloud again hoping greatly that someone can hear
him His frenzied maneuvering puts out the flame of the
Zippo

PAUL (CONTD)
Help me Please Somebody help
me
His words barely make it pass the coffin walls
With the cell phone still in hand and laboring to reclaim
the breath he just expended Paul turns to desperation He
dials the international code of 001 and then dials 911
A FEMALE 911 OPERATOR answers almost immediately

FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
911 please hold
The Female 911 Operator places Paul on hold

PAUL
No Wait
Paul accidentally bangs the cap of the Zippo against the
coffin wall putting out the flame
She quickly returns

FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
911 What is your emergency

PAUL

FEMALE 911 OPERATOR

(GIVING UP)
forget it
Realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless
Paul ends the call He checks the battery life on the phone
It still holds steady at two bars

He immediately dials another number one that he can recall
with ease
He again enters the 001 international code before making the
call
Paul then dials his home phone It rings several times so
far unanswered

PAUL
Come on come on Pick up
Please
After sitting through the agony of a few more rings Paul is
met with the answering machine

The voice of his young son SHANE is heard on the answering
machine greeting

SHANE
Thanks for calling the Conroys
Were not home right now Please
leave a message at the beep
Thanks
At the sound of the Beep Paul leaves a frenzied rambling
message

PAUL
Linda honey its me Listen I

Guard right away Or the Pentagon
Tell them we were attacked in the
Diyala Provence in Baqubah

(MORE)

PAUL (CONTD)
They have to find me Please help

Paul hangs up He dials his wifes cell phone right away
After several rings her cell phone voice mail picks up We
hear the sound of Linda Pauls wife on her outgoing
message

LINDA
Hi this is Linda Please leave a
message Thanks and have a great
day
The Beep sounds and Paul immediately tears into his voice
message

PAUL

Linda its Paul I need you to

call me right away This is an

absolute emergency Call the

number that comes up on your phone

Call me at that number If I dont
answer call the Pentagon or the

FBI I dont know what the hell

is going on but Im buried ina

box
Hearing himself say those last words gives him pause The
gravity of the situation fully takes hold

PAUL (CONTD)
I cant breathe in here Make
sure you call me right away
Please baby please call me

Paul ends the call He nervously looks at the amount of
battery life remaining on the phone Still holding strong at
two bars

He notices the flickering light of the Zippo It too
appears to be using up small amounts of oxygen He closes
the lid extinguishing the flame

Total darkness Silence save for Pauls increasingly heavy
breaths

He begins to hyperventilate He knows that preserving oxygen
is paramount so he does his best to calm himself The
healthy swig he takes from his flask helps

He flips open the cell phone The light of the display
screen partially illuminates his face and some of the coffin
with a blueish hue Paul again enters the overseas dialing
code this time dialing 411 information

The 411 OPERATOR answers

411 OPERATOR

PAUL

Paul reaches for his button-down shirt Fishes for pens
stashed in his lapel pocket while keeping the phone pressed
to his ear with his shoulder

PAUL
I dont care any city Just

digits followed by the word FBI

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

DOWN)
Paul Conroy
(back on the phone)
Okay Paul explain to me whats
going on

Paul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately
tell his story

PAUL
Alright Me and a convoy of other
drivers were delivering kitchen
parts to a community center As we
got closer a bunch of kids started
throwing rocks at our trucks Then
an IED went off up ahead and blew
up one of the other trucks These
guys came out from behind the
houses with guns and started
shooting everybody right there on
the street

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
Were you shot at

PAUL
I dont know
(after a breath calmer)
I dont know I was way in the
back of the convoy I must have got
hit in the head with one of the
rocks and got knocked out Thats
the last thing I remember But now
I just woke up and I was tied up
and buried in a coffin

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
Who put you there

PAUL
I guess whoever ambushed us

Special Agent Harris sounds slightly skeptical of Pauls
claims

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
A bunch of kids

PAUL
No youre not listening The kids
threw the rocks at us but then
some Iraqi guys -- maybe
insurgents I dont fucking know --
popped out of nowhere and started
shooting at us
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
I thought you said they didnt
shoot at you

PAUL
They didnt I dont know But
they shot them

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
Sir youre going to have to stop
shouting if --

PAUL
Im shouting because youre not

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
Hmmm
Paul takes a moment to center himself

PAUL

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

PAUL
I have no idea They didnt

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

PAUL

middle of the fucking desert Who

citizen Just send someone to find

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Do you know where youre
loifdy
The cell phone starts breaking up

PAUL
Hello What I cant hear you

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
Betunnear

Suddenly Special Agent Harris is not heard at all

PAUL
Hello Hello
Paul checks the phones display where he sees that the call
has been lost

PAUL (CONTD)
Shit
Cell phone service temporarily goes down Paul lights the
Zippo to help him see the cell phone screen He tries to
make a call but nothing happens
He shakes the phone moves it around the coffin all in
desperate hope that he will get a signal He soon does

He looks at the number for the FBI that he has written on
the wall thinking about calling them back He then checks
the battery life on his phone which remains at two bars
Paul then decides to make a different call this time to a
phone number he has committed to memory his employer back

the US Crestin Roland and Thomas (CRT)
He closes the lid of the Zippo extinguishing the flame
After a few rings a CRT OPERATOR answers

CRT OPERATOR

CRT OPERATOR

PAUL
Personnel No I need to talk --
Paul is placed on hold Synthesized soft rock plays in the
background of the phone maddening Paul further Over the
music a CRT SPOKESMAN is heard speaking a recorded
testimonial during the on-hold message

CRT SPOKESMAN

provide effective and sustainable
solutions to the challenges they

through to someone in human resources but leaves a message
nevertheless

Paul notices that his phone has again lost signal
PAUL (CONTD)

(EXASPERATED)
breaths

fuck
Paul drops the phone to his side the screen still emitting
its glow
He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear He screams and
flails his feet and hands wildly banging them against the
walls of the coffin His animalistic outburst causes the
phone to close
The coffin returns to pitch black
After a long beat Paul lights the Zippo which remains
wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the
wall of the coffin

Paul takes a few moments to catch his breath He looks again
at the cell phone Remembers receiving a Text Message

The icon on the phones display indicates that he does in
fact have an unread Text Message waiting for him

Paul quickly scrolls through the phones menu which is all
written in Arabic until he reaches what appears to be the
Text Message option Opening it he sees a series of ten
numbers
Using his click-up pencil he scribbles the numbers onto the
top of the coffin Next to the number he writes the word
HELP Noticing that his phone has again picked-up a
signal he dials the number

It rings once but then the reception begins to falter
After only two rings the call is ended Pauls frustration
mounts He is barely able to fight off another fit of
hysterics He dials the number again

It rings once A second ring In the middle of the third

ring someone answers -- but they do not say anything
PAUL

Hello Hello Is anyone there

Hello

After a beat Paul hears breathing on the other end of the
phone He also hears a discordance of background sound the
din of a room filled with Arabic-speaking men

PAUL (CONTD)
Hello Who are you Please you
have to help me
Still Pauls words are only met with slow measured

PAUL (CONTD)
Who is this Hello
The person on the other end eventually speaks An Iraqi man
JABIR talks forcefully and aggressively in broken English

JABIR
Breathe no breathe American Ah
Breathe no breathe

PAUL
What I dont know what youre
saying Who is this

JABIR
American can breathe no breathe

PAUL
No I cant breathe Please get me

PAUL
No not for Blackwater Im not a

JABIR

PAUL
Yes

JABIR
Then you are soldier
Despair falls upon Paul It becomes clear that Jabir is
responsible for all of this As such Paul crosses out the
word HELP Closes the lid of the Zippo leaving only the
cell phone display screen to illuminate his face

PAUL
No Im not Im here unarmed
But you still shot at us

JABIR
In head and in throat so you tell
no more lies

PAUL

JABIR

PAUL

dollars If they did I wouldnt

JABIR

PAUL
I dont know yes the Embassy will
pay you If you let me go theyll
pay you the money
Silence on the other end of the phone

JABIR
(after a long beat)

Nine PM five million money

Jabir hangs up the phone forcing Paul to instantly come to
grips with the fact that he is being held hostage

He lays back in the coffin shell-shocked Physically spent
the cell phone falls from his hands and onto the floor The
display screen casts a dim light throughout the coffin

FADE TO
INT COFFIN - MOMENTS LATER

The Zippo lights Paul holds it in his hand using it to

illuminate the inside of the coffin He attempts to push it

into its now customary resting place but the sand has

loosened making it difficult for the Zippo to stay in
place

It almost falls to the floor

Looking around Paul sees there is a crack between two
planks located on the opposite wall of the coffin He
wedges the lit Zippo into the crack

With his hands now free Paul haphazardly positions himself
so that his back is facing the top of the coffin
His every move is arduous the claustrophobic nature of the
coffin bearing down on him

Paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest with his
shins and feet pressed against the bottom of the coffin
Using the strength of his legs he attempts to lift the top
off the coffin with his back

Trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin
sprinkling against the wooden base

He fails only to immediately try again And again And
again Exhaustion sets in

Staring ahead the phone sits in front of him He notices
that the battery life bars are still at one solid and one
blinking

He grabs the cell phone staring at it trying to think of
someone else to call

The battery life is limited Every call has to count

He tries to remember some phone numbers but has trouble
recalling the information

PAUL

(TO HIMSELF)
Come on whats her number

He cannot remember the number hes thinking of He notices
that the flame of the Zippo flickers indicating its use of
his much-needed oxygen Paul closes the lid extinguishing
the flame

A second later we see him lit by the cell phone display
screen He dials the international code for the United
States followed by 411 information

A MALE 411 OPERATOR answers

PAUL

The phone rings some more Paul checks the battery life --
still at one and a half bars
DONNA eventually answers

DONNA

ear

PAUL

(EXPLODING)

Get me the number get me the
number
Donna hangs up on him Realizing this Paul bangs his fists
and claws at the top of the coffin bloodying some of his
fingers and knuckles in the process
He violently tosses and turns and screams at the top of his
lungs like an animal trapped in a cage Tears spray from
his eyes as spit shakes free from his mouth by the force of
his shudder

He eventually calms quite a bit Sniffing away tears and
taking notice of the damage hes done to his hands Paul
slows his breathing as best he can

He lies there motionless

The silence is almost comforting Paul closes his eyes
regretfully accepting what appears will be his inescapable
fate

After a beat he calls Donna back Knowing it is Paul
calling she answers right away attitude at the ready

DONNA
What
It takes every ounce of Pauls being to keep himself from
going off the deep end He takes a beat to compose himself
and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate
response

PAUL
Donna Im very sorry I yelled
But Im only going to ask you once
more to get me this number If you
dont get me this number Im going
to die

DONNA

PAUL

sound of keys being pressed on a computer keyboard

man others He writes the initials SD next to it

DONNA

now

REBECCA
(after a beat)
We received a call froma
representative at CRT You left
him a message

PAUL
Yeah

REBECCA
He contacted us right away

PAUL
Well since you know what the hell
is going on what have you done to
get me out of here

REBECCA
Theres little we can do from
Washington

PAUL
So thats it Im just supposed

Even faced with Pauls sarcasm Rebecca remains stolid
Professional

REBECCA
Well do everything we can

PAUL
So youll pay them

REBECCA

(BEAT)
No That we cant do

PAUL
Waitwhat

REBECCA
Its the policy of the United
States government to not negotiate
with terrorists

PAUL
To hell with that Its easy for
you to worry about policy youre
sitting in an air conditioned
office somewhere probably
finishing up your sandwich from
lunch Youre not the one stuck in
a coffin buried in the God damn
desert

REBECCA
I understand your frustration --

PAUL
Frustration Lady Im going to
fucking die in here Understand
that
Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone Paul
wonders if she is still there The idea of being alone again
scares him terribly

PAUL (CONTD)
Hello
Worried Paul lights the Zippo The reflection of the flame
dances on his frightened eyes

REBECCA
Im here

Momentary relief After a beat

PAUL
Well then say something Tell me
how youre going to get me out of
here

REBECCA
Whats the number on the phone
youre calling from

PAUL
I dont know Did it come up on
your end

REBECCA
No Its listed as unavailable
Do this -- take down this number

Paul takes out his pen

PAUL
Go ahead

REBECCA

410-195-5453
Paul writes the number onto the top of the coffin
PAUL
Whos that

REBECCA
Dan Brenner Hes the commander of
the Hostage Working Group over in
Iraq

Paul writes D BRENNER next to Dans phone number

PAUL
Hostage Working Group

REBECCA
We formed it in 2004 to deal with
situations such as yours
Paul shakes his head in disgust

PAUL
Situations I love how you keep
calling it that

REBECCA
Did you write down the number

PAUL
Yeah

REBECCA
Good Hold on Ill connect you
with him now He should be
expecting you

PAUL
What about the news Im going to
call them

REBECCA

No Do not I repeat do not
contact the news

PAUL
Why
REBECCA
It will only complicate things
further and threaten your chances
of rescue
Paul doesnt buy it

PAUL
Thats bullshit Youre just
covering your ass

REBECCA
No Im covering yours Everyone
who needs to know about this does

PAUL
You dont go looking for something
if you dont know its missing

REBECCA
Thats why you need to contact Dan
Brenner right away
Paul still contemplates contacting the news but soon
acquiesces to Rebeccas pleas for him not to

PAUL
Fine

REBECCA
Im transferring you now

Rebeccas gone Paul waits Several beeps sound as hes
being transferred

Paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him outside the
coffin While the beeps continue to sound he lights the
Zippo circumspectly looking behind him He doesnt see
anything

With the Zippo still lit Paul takes a deep centering
breath followed by another

A few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard After two
rings DAN BRENNER answers

DAN
Brenner
PAUL
Dan Brenner

Dan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling
him

DAN
Is this Paul Conroy

PAUL

(EXCITED)
Yes yes its me Its Paul

DAN
Paul I was informed of whats
going on I want you to know that
were already working on trying to
get you out of there

Paul is relieved His first glint of hope has appeared
Tears of joy instantly escape his eyes

PAUL
Oh thank you God

DAN
I was told that we have until 9pm
Is that right

PAUL
Thats what he said

DAN
Alright That doesnt give us a
whole lot of time And just so I
have this right the kidnappers
buried you in the ground

PAUL
Yeah in an old wooden coffin

DAN
Okay My guess is that since
youre able to get a cell signal
youre no more than a few feet
underground

PAUL
I dont know Maybe

DAN
What about battery life How much
does the phone have left
Paul looks at the display to find out

PAUL
Less than half

DAN
Okay You have to conserve that
battery Our best bet of finding
you is by tracking your cell
signal Is the ringer set on a
sound or vibrate

PAUL
Vibrate

DAN
Press and hold down the asterisk
key to change it to a ring tone
It will use less power

PAUL
What about my Zippo

DAN
You have a lighter

PAUL
Yeah
DAN
Use it to look around for markings
a logo -- whatever you can find
PAUL

Wont it use up oxygen
DAN
Not much Dont worry about that
now Try to find --

PAUL
Its really dark in here without
it

DAN

I understand Paul Try to find
anything in there that might
indicate where that coffin was
made

PAUL
You guys have to hurry

DAN
Were working as fast as we can
Paul

PAUL

Do you know if there were any other
survivors

DAN
From your convoy

PAUL
Yeah

DAN
Thats still unclear at this point

PAUL
I just wanted to do right by my
family Thats all

(MORE)

PAUL (CONTD)
I didnt know it was going to be
like this over here

DAN
I dont think any of us did
While on the phone with Brenner Paul gets another call
coming in He checks the display and reads the number
Matching it against a number he wrote on the top of the
coffin he sees that is Jabir calling

PAUL
Its him Hes calling

DAN
The kidnapper

PAUL
Yeah What do I do

DAN
You know his number

PAUL
Yeah

DAN
Give it to me

PAUL

What about the call

DAN
Give me the number first
The phone has rung several times Paul fears that Jabir may
hang up

PAUL
Hes going to hang up

DAN
Take the call

PAUL
BUT --
DAN
Take the call Now
Paul complies with Dans demand and switches to the other

line

PAUL
Hello

JABIR
Two hour six minute
Paul looks at his watch Indeed he has but two hours and
six minutes until the time reaches 9pm

PAUL
You have to give me more time

JABIR
You talk to embassy They give
money

PAUL

Yes No I talked tosomeone
Government They said that they
wont pay the money

JABIR
No pay

PAUL
No They said that they dont
negotiate with terrorists

JABIR
Terrorists I am terrorist

PAUL
Yes You are terrorist you son of
a bitch

JABIR
You are terrified so I am
terrorist

PAUL

What did I ever do to you

JABIR
Ever do

PAUL
Yeah Im here because its a job
to make money Thats it

JABIR
I have job until you come Now my
family have nothing

PAUL
Thats not my fault
Jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to Pauls

JABIR
Nine one one was not my fault
but still you are here Saddam was
not my fault but still you are
here

PAUL
I told you Im only here to work
To help rebuild

JABIR
Rebuild what you destroyed

Paul cannot handle his stress any longer He begins to
crumble under the pressure

PAUL

Stop Just please stop Im just

a guy Im just a truck driver

Okay Im nobody that makes

decisions about anything I just

want to go home

Silence from the other end of the phone for an extended
period of time

JABIR
You make video ransom video
This surprisingly comes as good news to Paul

PAUL
Yes Please Get me out of here
and Ill make the video

JABIR
No You make video now

PAUL
What How
JABIR
You use video on phone
Pauls hopes are dashed His sanguine head falls back onto
the coffin floor

JABIR (CONTD)
Near foot You read note near foot
in box
Paul shines the flame of his Zippo lighter toward his feet
He doesnt see anything

PAUL
Where I dont see --

JABIR
Near foot Read note inside box
Paul repositions his legs as best he can He can vaguely see
the corner of a small metal box partially sticking out of a
broken plank on the bottom of the coffin

PAUL
The videoif I make it will you
let me go

JABIR
Only if we get money

PAUL
Nobodys going to pay five million
dollars for me

JABIR
We take less One million money

PAUL
If they pay it will you let me go

JABIR
(after a beat)
One million money
Jabir hangs up ending the call
Paul sits motionless for a moment soaking in all that Jabir
has just told him
that

coffin

He again looks down toward his feet He can see the
protruding corner of the metal box but its positioned in
such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach
it

Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet but after
several unsuccessful attempts he realizes that a new
strategy is necessary

He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin so

his head and feet will ultimately switch places He
struggles inch by troubled inch to make this maneuver
Sweat pours down the side of his face The extremely tight
quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly
impossible

After expending a great deal of energy doing so Paul
eventually completes the turn of his body He examines the
small rusted metal box On it is a cartoon picture of a
small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball
Skeptical at first Paul carefully examines the box and
shakes it gently Items are heard rummaging inside

He carefully opens it A fluorescent green light shines from
inside
Paul looks inside and finds a lit green glow stick
fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the

He closes the lid of the Zippo Removes the stick

Looking into the small box again he finds several other
items a small disused flashlight a second unlit glow
stick a jackknife and lastly a folded piece of paper

He slowly unfolds the piece of paper We see that his ransom
message is written in an unintelligible mix of English and
Arabic

Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust He
crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to
his side He covers his face with his hands his labored
breaths echoing in his palms

Under the low-light of the green glow stick Paul picks up
the phone and dials his home

Per usual he gets the answering machine His son Shane is
heard on outgoing message

SHANE
Thanks for calling the Conroys
Were not home right now Please
leave a message at the beep

Thanks

Pauls eyes well up with tears He smiles at the sound of
his sons voice The Beep is heard Paul hangs up without
leaving a message

He looks at the time Its 702pm Battery life is holding
steady at one and a half bars He remembers something

PAUL
Shit
Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone
that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone
The glow stick begins to slowly fade
Paul dials Dan Brenner
After a few rings Dan answers

DAN
Paul

PAUL
Heres his number

Paul presses the green key bringing up the last numbers
dialed and received

DAN
Hold on Alright go ahead

PAUL
Its 07902-24-921
Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him
and then returns his attention to Paul

DAN
This is huge Unless theyre using
a cloned line we should be able to
find where this is coming from in
minutes

PAUL
What about me Can you track my
cell signal
DAN
Were having a lot of trouble with
yours Seems to be an EDS line
probably through one of the
Egyptian carriers

PAUL
What does that mean

DAN
Thatits not going to be easy

PAUL
He wants me to make a ransom video

DAN
No Hold off for as long as you
can

PAUL

If its going to get me out of
here Im making it

DAN
The last thing we want is for this
to end up all over Al Jazeera

PAUL
We
Paul becomes angry again sensing that more emphasis is
being
placed on containing the situation than rescuing him

DAN
This cant turn into an
international incident

PAUL
Thats all you people care about
But what about me Dont you care
about me

DAN
We do Thats why were --
PAUL
No you dont You people dont
care about any of us Ive had
eight friends killed out here six
of them today We dont have any
guns any armor Nothing

DAN
Youre not soldiers

PAUL
Tell that to the people who put me
in this box Tell that to the
people who shot my friends

DAN
Were doing the best we can

PAUL
No youre not All you people
understand are your secret plans
and your back room politics

(MORE)

PAUL (CONTD)
If I were some diplomat or
something maybe even a hostage
working group leader -- or whatever
your fancy title is Id be out of
here by now Wouldnt I But Im
not so Im just supposed to keep
my mouth shut and die

DAN
I need you to stay focused Paul

PAUL
Fuck you
Dans heard enough

DAN
Paul listen to me finding you is
our primary concern Bottom line
And were searching just as hard as
we would be for a four-star
general so dont literally waste
your breath suggesting otherwise
Paul does not respond at first Dans retort clearly has an
effect on him

PAUL
Who are they The people who put
me here

DAN
Theyre just that -- people No
different from you and me

PAUL
Im no terrorist

DAN
Neither are they

PAUL
How do you know that

DAN
If you were homeless
starvingactually I take that
back If your family was homeless
and starving what would you do for
them

PAUL
I wouldnt kill someone

DAN
How can you be sure

PAUL

(GETTING FRUSTRATED)
What difference does it make

DAN
Theyre criminals desperate ones
at that They dont care about
anything other than getting the
money

PAUL
So pay them then

DAN
Trust me if it was an option I
would do that in a heartbeat

PAUL
How many others have there been

DAN
Since I got here Hundreds
Journalists contractors
soldiershundreds have been
taken Its one of the only
functioning businesses out here

PAUL
How many have you rescued
Dan is reluctant to answer the question

PAUL (CONTD)
How many

DAN

(BEAT)
Not many

PAUL
Tell me their names

DAN
Who

PAUL
Any of them Make me know they

really do matter to you

DAN
Mark White

PAUL
Who was Mark White

DAN
A kid from New Hampshire Twenty-
six years old Med student Came
over here to help out local
doctors

PAUL
What happened to him

DAN
Insurgents grabbed him

PAUL
When

DAN
About three weeks ago
Paul writes MARK WHITE on the top of the coffin
list of phone numbers He circles the name

PAUL
You remember his name

DAN
I remember all their names

PAUL
(afraid to ask)
Did he Is he
The glow stick begins to fade

DAN
Yeah Yeah Paul hes alive

Hearing this affords Paul some semblance of relief

below the

Paul shakes the glow stick returning it to its full

strength
PAUL
Where is he
DAN
Home Probably happy to be back at
school
PAUL

I want to get out of here

DAN
We found him well find you too

PAUL
How

DAN

We already have a solid lead on the
number you gave us

PAUL
You do

DAN
A units on its way over there
now

This news calms Pauls nerves

PAUL
Thatsthats good

DAN
Yeah

PAUL
What should I do in the meantime

DAN
I know its hard but try to relax
The more worked up you are the
more air youre going to use

PAUL
I cant help it Im always
anxious I take pills for it

DAN
Do you have them with you

Paul checks his pants pockets He removes a small

pill bottle

PAUL
Yeah

DAN

orange
again

Take them You need to preserve
your oxygen level any way you can

PAUL
Okay

DAN
Is your Zippo still lit

PAUL
Not now

DAN
Good

PAUL

I feel nauseous

DAN
You have to calm down

PAUL
Im trying

DAN
And you need to save that battery
Were expecting some intel in about
ten minutes Call me back then

PAUL
Okay

DAN
Just hang in there Paul
The glow stick begins to slowly fade Paul shakes it
causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming

PAUL
Yeah Im trying
Dan ends the call Paul lets out a deep breath finding it
difficult to lay claim to its replacement
He looks at his watch Its now 718pm The ticking sound
of the second hand turning is inordinately loud due to the
extreme silence of the coffin

Just then the cell phone rings Checking the number on the
display Paul sees that it is Jabir

Paul answers

PAUL
What

JABIR
Did you make video

PAUL
No
Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we
hear in the background
Collectively they do not sound pleased Slightly panicked
in fact though it is difficult to tell for sure

JABIR

(TO PAUL)
You make video

PAUL
Let me out and Ill make it

JABIR
No You make video now In box

PAUL
I cant I cant read the paper

JABIR
Make video now

PAUL

I cant I dont know what you

want me to say I cant read the

paper

Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the
background Although they speak in Arabic it is clear from
their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly
hostile

Jabir returns his attention back to Paul
JABIR

You make video now

Jabir ends the call Paul closes the phone to help conserve
battery life

He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu
options Everything is written in Arabic He eventually
comes across an icon with a movie camera -- the video
function He turns it on Looks at himself though the
viewfinder
After a beat he closes the phone clearly frustrated and
growing more panicked His breaths grow heavy and rapid
utilizing a great deal of oxygen

PAUL

Im never getting out of here

Paul begins to freak out restlessly squirming inside the
coffin and pressing against the sides and top
The glow stick fades out almost completely offering very
little light Paul shakes it but with no change to its
brightness Moments later it dies Paul tries the
flashlight Click-click Click-click Nothing
He bangs it a few times with his hand The white light turns
on but quickly turns back off He twists the top which
causes the flashlight to switch bulbs A red beam emits
momentarily Paul twists the top again and gives the
flashlight a few good whacks

It turns on White light shines dimly on his face

He takes a breath

In efforts to calm himself he once again removes the orange
pill bottle from his pocket He pours two into his hand He
then removes his small metal alcohol flask from his back
pocket and takes a large swig swallowing the two pills in
the process
Still Pauls heavy labored breathing continues He drops
four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet
another generous pull from the flask

He sits and waits Nothing is happening except that his
extremely limited time keeps passing

After a moment Paul picks up the cell phone He holds it in
front of him hesitant to make a call After some
consideration he dials
After a few rings a NURSING HOME NURSE answers

NURSING HOME NURSE
Mountain View Nursing Home

PAUL
I was hoping I could speak with
Maryanne Conroy please

NURSING HOME NURSE

Umokay Ahlet me bring the
cordless phone to her room Hold
on a moment please

We hear the Nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor

soon reaches Pauls mothers room

NURSING HOME NURSE (CONTD)

Misses Conroy you have a telephone

phone

Pauls mother MARYANNE answers Her voice is pleasant but

She

confused Its clear that she suffers from advanced stages

of Alzheimers Disease

MARYANNE

LOVE --

MARYANNE
Yes dear Your father and I have

been playing gin rummy every night

PAUL
(after a beat)
Okay Mom Tell Pop I said hi

to vibrate mode

He lays there sobbing relentlessly
After a long beat the cell phone rings
than his past reactions to an incoming call Paul seems
hopelessly disinterested The ring is maddening

He mindlessly presses the shortcut button resetting the

Paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart

Decidedly different

He eventually picks up the phone but there is not anyone on
the other end Its then that he sees that it was not a call
that came in but instead was a picture message

Pressing what appears to be the Accept button the incoming
picture begins to download

Several seconds later the picture downloads and an image
appears on the display of Pauls cell phone Its of a woman
-- bound and gagged a gun pressed against the side of her
head

PAUL
Oh no No no no
Paul frantically dials the number to reach Jabir As soon as
the phone connects Paul begins his desperate plea

JABIR
Video make
PAUL
Let her go Please Please dont

hurt her
The Woman is heard in the background of Jabirs phone
crying
muffled words through her muzzled mouth

JABIR
We shoot her if you no make video

PAUL
No No please no shoot No shoot

JABIR

You get money American million

PAUL

JABIR

PAUL

Okay Okay Ill make the video

Just please dont shoot

Jabir does not fire his gun Paul attempts to catch his
breath

PAUL (CONTD)
I need to hang up to make the
video Okay Is that okay

JABIR
You have three minute to send
video

Jabir hangs up ending the call

Paul reaches for the balled-up piece of paper that has the
ransom script written on it It takes some trouble for him
to grab it but he is soon able to

Placing the flashlight next to the paper Paul is again
reminded of the incoherent nature of the script

PAUL

(re the script)

Fuck
He drops the paper to his side and opens the phone setting
it to the video record function He places the flashlight
close to his face so as to make his image more visible on

the

small phone display screen

He presses the record button

PAUL

(speaking at the phone)

My name is Paul Conroy Im an

American citizen from Hastings

Michigan Im a civilian truck

driver for Crestin Roland and

Thomas Ive been taken hostage

somewhere in Iraqand I need one

million dollars by nine oclock

tonight Baghdad time or else Ill

be left to die in this coffin Im

buried in Ive been told that

if
The flashlight goes out Paul continues speaking in the
darkness After a few quick smacks the flashlight turns
back on

PAUL (CONTD)

the money is paid I will be let

go If its not I will die in

here These threats are real and

will be followed through on
Trying to think of more to say Paul soon opts for not

saying

anything further He saves the message and then sends it to
Jabir
We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video
has been sent
Paul places the phone on his chest Still rubbing his
temples his eyes begin to flutter a bit He tries to
control his breathing and remain calm
move

toward

He opens the phone and displays the photo of the Woman He
stares admiringly at her hoping dearly that she will not be
harmed

The effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect his
eyes soon close and he drifts off to sleep

FADE TO
INT COFFIN - LATER

Darkness once again We hear the sound of Paul slowly
awaking followed the sight of Zippo sparks

It doesnt catch The second glow stick is snapped
illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue

Paul starts to move but suddenly freezes His eyes widen
His pupils dilate Something is clearly very wrong though
we cannot see what

His eyes slowly shift downward as if watching something

down his body Beads of sweat form across his brow His
measured breaths are held for as long as they can be
Moving excruciatingly slow Paul lowers the glow stick

what he is looking at

A shape moves across his stomach underneath his T-shirt
Pauls eyes are fixed on whatever it may be He cautiously
slowly moves the glow stick even closer

The shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick
shines on whatever it may be Still Paul does not dare make
any sudden move

Pauls pant leg moves slightly starting at the top slowly
undulating toward his cuff

Paul leans the glow stick in further And further
Carefully Moving a millimeter at a time He shifts the
position of his head slightly charily to see next to his
feet

He leans in even closer with the glow stick But then --
-- his wary movement comes to immediate stop

Its a snake A two-foot saw-scaled viper It has
positioned itself in the corner of the coffin inches from
Pauls feet

itself

it

down

His terror evident Paul very slowly pulls his feet back
toward his upper body away from the snake The confined
space offers little room for safety
The snake turns its muscled neck to face Paul Their eyes
meet for the first time The snake hisses poised to strike
at any moment Paul raises his foot Steels himself
Prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp

A more sensible plan soon prevails After lowering his foot
Paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket Slowly
unscrews the top Splashes a small amount of alcohol on the
floor close to the snake

The snake recoils slightly but then menacingly twists

into a new posture ready to attack Paul lowers the Zippo
to the small puddle of alcohol After a few sparks --

-- it lights A flash-fire The snake flails and hisses
wildly at the other side of a small fire wall

The flame soon goes out Paul moves fast Throws more
alcohol this time some of it lands on the snake itself He
places the already lit Zippo against the puddle of alcohol
near the snake

Another flash-fire this time burning the snake It hisses
loudly Threateningly It swings back and forth
challenging the small wall of fire

The fire soon extinguishes The snake burrows into the hole
from where it likely entered the coffin disappearing into

with haste
Paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button-

shirt He then pours a small amount of alcohol over the
shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground but does
not screw the cap on securely He then wedges the lit Zippo
between a small space between two wooden planks

With the snake situation handled Paul finally lets out a
sigh of relief Rubs his eyes Tries to regain his
faculties Looks over the list of phone numbers written
above him
Suddenly the cell phone vibrates Paul frenziedly searches
for it but he cannot find it He then notices it has fallen
into the small hole near his feet out of his reach

He makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet
but he is unable to do so It continues to ring

His next efforts involve repositioning himself in the coffin
so that he completely turns to face the opposite end

dim

Struggling through each move Paul painstakingly begins to
turn himself While turning however he inadvertently kicks

the Zippo from the side of the coffin -- landing it on the
floor up against the glow stick -- and knocks over the
flask

We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plastic
glow stick causing it to dim slightly

Worst still and completely unbeknownst to Paul a stream of
alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the
flame of the lighter threatening to set the coffin ablaze
Inch by inch the flammable spirit gets closer

Still in the midst of his repositioning Paul looks back and
sees the alcohol nearing the flame In a panic he attempts
to reach and grab the Zippo But he finds himself stuck in
the middle of the coffin He cant budge either way

PAUL
No no no
Desperately straining every muscle in his body he extends
his arm backward toward the Zippo hoping to move it away
from the spilled alcohol He still cant reach it yet he
tries with all his might
The phone stops ringing He has missed the call
He tries blowing at the flame but his head is too far away
and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than
cause it to flicker
With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame Paul
reaches for his shoe His odd positioning makes reaching his
foot almost impossible He struggles to undo the laces and
remove it from his foot
With his face beet red from the force of his strain Paul
finally removes his shoe The mere inch of leg room this
creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him
The trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact with
the flame --
-- but Paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to
awkwardly kick the Zippo out of the way and close the lid
Paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the

light of the damaged glow stick He notices another hole in
the coffin As a precaution he stuffs it with the cloth
that had previously been used to gag him

readable

his

Just as he is about to grab the phone he hears what appears
to be the faint sound of a Muslim call to prayer being
announced over the citywide PA system The sound barely
makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that
envelop the coffin

A sign of hope as well as a point of reference for his
location -- albeit a very vague one

He listens further as the call to prayer continues The
light of the glow stick dims further

Paul then opens his phone Sees that he missed Jabirs call
He starts to call Jabir back but stops He instead
navigates through the various display menus He soon reaches
what appears to be the Tools Menu though its difficult to
tell because everything is written in Arabic He becomes
frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for

On the verge of mental surrender he sees something that
gives him pause A smile crosses his face

PAUL
(re the phone screen)
There you are
We see on the display of the phone that Paul has found a
listing of languages He scrolls past many -- FRANCAIS
DETSCHE ESPANOL -- stopping at ENGLISH Presses the
button instantly making all the text on the screen

He quickly navigates to the Tools menu Scrolls down
Locates the number of the cell phone he is using

He scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin Then a
second pass making it bolder than the others

Paul then dials his wifes cell phone After only a few
rings he is met by her voice mail

LINDA (VO)
Hi this is Linda Please leave a

message Thanks and have a great

day

The beep sounds and Paul frantically proceeds right into

message

PAUL
Linda heres the number for the
phone I just found it out Its

international calling code first

kind

PAUL (CONTD)
Please call me as soon as you get
this I love youI love you
Call me right away Please
Paul hangs up He looks at the battery life left on the
phone One bar He then checks his watch Its 819pm
Both are not good signs and he knows it

PAUL (CONTD)

Oh shit

He begins to panic Grabbing the pocket knife that was left
inside the metal box he slides the blade in the space
between the sides of the coffin and the top

Paul grabs the glow stick But because it was partially
melted to the floor the stick snaps in two Liquid oozes
out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the
floor

PAUL
Son of a
Paul grabs the flashlight Turns it on It works for a
second but then goes out Shaking it only produces
intermittent beams of light
He turns the top switching to the red bulb It works The
coffin fills with a reddish hue but then it too goes out
Growing incensed Paul switches back to the white bulb It
works
He returns his attention to the coffin His efforts to use
the knife as a fulcrum are futile Still he tries Bending
the blade well past its design it nearly breaks off its
handle
The flashlight turns off After a good shaking it turns
back on emitting white light
With oxygen levels extremely diminished efforts of this

are all too much for Paul to take He has to stop and try to
catch his breath

As he endeavors to get his wind back the cell phone rings
Not a call this time but instead a video message It has
been sent by Jabir

Pauls trepidation is evident He fears what the incoming
video may show

After a beat he presses the Accept button and the video
downloads Within seconds the video plays on his phone
display screen We see in the video the American Woman
that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent
through

rounds

bottom

vomit-

to Paul She is still bound at her wrists but her gag has
been lowered

She sits on her knees Standing behind her are three men
all with their faces shielded by Arab headdresses They each
hold AK-47 assault weapons

Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks

her tears into the camera

WOMAN

My name is Pamela Gorham Ima

food service worker at FOB

Anaconda employed by Crestin

Roland and Thomas My captors

requests for ransom have gone

unanswered and --
The Woman Pamela looks off-screen to her right Someone is
fast approaching her She cowers protectively holding her
bound hands in front of her face as she screams

WOMAN (CONTD)
(to the person)
Nowait Please -- no
Another Iraqi man steps into the cameras line of site a
handgun already brandished
Without as much as a moments hesitation he fires two

directly into Pamelas head killing her

The video message ends immediately thereafter Paul is in
complete shock
He screams aloud slamming his closed fist against the

of the coffin

PAUL
No No no no
Still in the throes of emotional torment Paul vomits on
himself He doubles over only to vomit once again
His body taxed almost to the point of complete physical
breakdown gradually slows and levels itself With his

smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the
coffin Paul stares into nothingness

blade

to

After a beat his eye catches a glimmer of light -- the

of the knife reflecting off the beam of the flashlight
Paul reaches for the knife Lying on his back still
suffering enormous mental strain he places the cutting edge
of the blade against his neck His jugular vein

His hand shakes his lips tremble

The hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the
handle It too shakes

Paul closes his eyes

A small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his
neck where the blade of the knife rests ready to open his
veln

After a great deal of consideration Paul throws the knife

the foot of the coffin

He cant do it

The flashlight falls from Pauls chest It turns off upon
landing on the floor of the coffin

Paul sits in darkness His breaths echo off the coffin
walls

After a beat he turns on the flashlight It turns off after
less than two seconds This time however he does not shake
it nor does he hit it

A moment later we hear a click followed by the sight of a
red light beam emitting from the flashlight It holds
steady

Paul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on
the top of the coffin He stops at MARK WHITE

After a beat he lowers the flashlight to his side

He picks up the phone and dials Brenner After one ring
Brenner answers Hes clearly not pleased Paul however
is surprisingly calm Detached Almost disturbingly so

DAN
Why the hell did you make that
video

PAUL

Its all a bunch of lies

DAN
What is What are you talking
about

PAUL
All of it

DAN
All of what

PAUL

Nobody gives a shit about any of
us Were nothing to you people

DAN
Were going to find you

PAUL
By looking the other way

DAN
You cant start breaking on me now
Paul You have to stay strong

PAUL
You let her die
DAN
(after a beat)
No I didnt
PAUL

They shot herand you didnt do
anything

DAN
We didnt even know she had been
taken hostage

PAUL
She sent three videos

DAN
Thats what they told her to say

PAUL
Why

DAN
I dont know
PAUL
What do you know

DAN
That your ransom video already has
47000 hits on YouTube And all
the major networks are playing it
including Al Jazeera So now your
captors have no choice but to
follow through

PAUL
I found out the number to this
phone

DAN
How

PAUL
I found a way to change the display
language I figured that out and
you didnt Why

DAN
Because I didnt Just like you
and every other person on this
planet there are some things I
know and some things I dont

PAUL
Then how are you ever going to find
me

DAN
Their signal was cloned like we
figured But were close Real
close

PAUL
What about mine

DAN
Were working on that too

PAUL
Im near a Mosque I could hear
the call to prayer over the PA

DAN
Good That means that were in the
right area

PAUL
Youre nearby

DAN
I spoke with soldiers from the
third ID who were escorting your
convoy

PAUL
Theyre alive
After a beat

DAN
Not all of them Both Bradley
tanks were hit with IEDs The rest
got caught in small arms fire

(BEAT)
What the hell happened out there
Paul

Paul doesnt answer at first

DAN (CONTD)
Paul
After a beat

PAUL
We had just left Anaconda
everything seemed okay We knew
that a bunch of our CB radios had
been stolen and that the Iraqis
were listening in so we made sure
to switch from our usual channels
Pam was riding with Jeff Breer the
convoy commander She wanted to
ride with me like she usually did
when she hitched a ride from base
but it seemed safer for her to be
with the CC As we headed down
the road all these kids came
running into the street Dozens of
them It almost seemed like they
were expecting us except we got
there faster than they thought we
would So they run on up in front
of me and I slam on my brakes
The rest of the drivers were
already further up ahead so they
kept going Next thing I know one
of the lead trucks got hit by an
IED I hear Tommy Wilkes on the
radio saying Sandmans hit
Sandmans hit Heshes
everywhere

(MORE)

PAUL (CONTD)
Thats when the Iraqis came out of
their mud huts from the side of the
road and started shooting
everybody I couldnt believe what
was happening It seemed like slow-
motion like I was watching it on
TV People -- my friends -- were
getting killed and all I could do
is watch I didnt even notice
that the kids were throwing bricks
and rocks at me until one split my
windshield Sort of snapped me out
of my trance But then I guess I
got hit in the head with a rock
cause blacked out

DAN

Do you happen to rememmo

nea

The cell phone service begins to cut out Suddenly the
coffin begins to vibrate slightly dropping sand granules
through the crack and onto the wood bottom followed by the
faint sound of an explosion
Within seconds the explosions grow louder and more
proximate The vibration becomes so intense that it
violently shakes Paul around the coffin

The sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above
flying by as the massive explosions continue

Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of
the coffin as it shakes Paul does his best to brace
through

body

himself but the bombardment is far too powerful

A large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin
spanning almost its entire length Sand immediately pours
through the concave shaped crack seeping in onto Paul like
an hourglass

Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the
immense pressure from the sand above Paul positions himself
underneath it and presses with all his might He grunts and
screams loudly using what little strength he has left to
keep the top from caving

The shaking soon stops though the steady flow of sand
continues

In efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any
faster Paul removes the button-down shirt from the hole and
stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest
volume He removes the balled-up cloth from the other hole
and does the same with it Both offer very little help

The flashlight falls to the floor The red light beam turns
off Darkness The sound of sand steadily pouring down

PAUL

(EXHAUSTED)
Oh nono
Paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting White
light shines but then goes out He shakes the flashlight
and it stays on shining its normal white beam

He assesses his situation noticing that the coffin is
already filled with a small layer of sand a situation that
is only going to get worse with time

PAUL
This cant be happening
We see that Dan Brenner is no longer on the phone and that
the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line

it -- No Service Available
Once he feels it is secure enough Paul slowly moves his

away from the crack Although slightly caved it does not
show any more signs of possible collapse
Sweat drenches his face His eyes affixed in utter
disbelief on the sand as it spills into the coffin filling
in around him inch-by-inch

He grabs the cell phone only to see that he does not have a
signal

PAUL (CONTD)
No Come on Please work
He shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin
hoping that it may somehow help His efforts are futile
The flashlight goes dead He hits it shakes it It turns
back on The brightness is diminished
Still the sand continues to fall drowning him deeper and
deeper in a pool of granules
Then very surprisingly the cell phone rings Paul answers
right away

PAUL

(FRANTICALLY)
Hello Hello Whos there
Alan Davenport answers calmly from the other end

ALAN DAVENPORT
Is this Paul Conroy

PAUL
Yes Yes this is Paul Who are

PAUL
The hostage takers Dan Brenner
from the hostage working group --

ALAN DAVENPORT

Okay Paul Im with you How

about the media I know your

ransom video leaked but have you

spoken directly to anyone about

whats going on

The flashlight goes out Paul hits it a few times and it
turns back on

PAUL
No

ALAN DAVENPORT
Thats good It needs to stay that
way Its important that we keep
this situation as contained as
possible
Paul finds Alans obvious concern with doing damage control
to be infuriating

PAUL

About three inches to my right
theres a wall Three inches to my
left theres another wall And
about four inches above my head
theres a roof thats about to
collapse and drown me in sand I
think this situation is pretty
contained

ALAN DAVENPORT

PAUL

going to do to help me

ALAN DAVENPORT
I know youre upset And from
what Ive been told steps are
being taken to get you out of
there So hopefully it wont be
much longer

PAUL
Thank God

ALAN DAVENPORT
Yes thank God

(BEAT)

Im going to switch on a recorder

right now Just a second

Pauls visage expresses his confusion
A click is heard in the bg of Alans phone followed by a
low steady hum
Alans speech becomes very laconic His questions are
clearly being read from a Human Resources handbook of some
kind

ALAN DAVENPORT (CONTD)

his is Alan Davenport Personnel
irector for Crestin Roland and
homas Incorporated The date is
ctober 23 2006 I am speaking
ith Paul Conroy Mister Conroy
re you aware that Im recording
his conversation

toe FOHUH

PAUL

What
ALAN DAVENPORT
Please answer the question
The flashlight goes out again

PAUL
Shit
Paul hits it but it does not catch He sits in darkness

ALAN DAVENPORT
Mister Conroy

PAUL
Yes Yes

ALAN DAVENPORT
And do I have your permission to do
so

PAUL
Why do you need my permission
What is all this

ALAN DAVENPORT
I need you to answer yes or no
please

PAUL
Yes Alright Yes
Paul hits the flashlight It turns back on

ALAN DAVENPORT
Thank you Now Mister Conroy
when were you hired by CRT

PAUL
About nine months ago Around
January of 2005 Why are you
wasting time with this

ALAN DAVENPORT
I have your official date of hire
as January 4th 2005 Is that
correct

PAUL
Who cares This is fucking crazy --

ALAN DAVENPORT
January 4th 2005 Is that
correct

PAUL
Yes

ALAN DAVENPORT
And during your initial training
before being sent to Iraq were you
made aware of the dangers inherent
to the position for which you were
hired

PAUL

You mean when I came down there to

Dallas and you guys said that all

of the trucks would be armored and

have bulletproof glass

The flashlight dims Paul angrily shakes it returning it to
full strength

PAUL (CONTD)
You mean when you told us that
things were safer than ever over
here Is that when I was made
aware

ALAN DAVENPORT
I need you to answer yes or no
please

PAUL

(BEAT)
Yes
The flashlight begins to slowly dim

ALAN DAVENPORT
During that time did you also
receive and sign an employment
contract with CRT which thoroughly
explained company policy as it
pertained to your specific terms of
employment

PAUL
Yeah I signed a bunch of things

ALAN DAVENPORT
Yes or no

PAUL
Yes I signed the contract Yes

ALAN DAVENPORT
Its our understanding that you
were taken hostage in Iraq two
hours ago is that also correct

PAUL
Yes Thats completely correct
What is the point of all this

Alan breaks from the HR handbook script though his tone
remains just as matter-of-fact The flashlight continues its
steady slow dim

ALAN DAVENPORT
Our legal department requires that
we obtain a sworn affidavit from
employees confirming that they
understand the reasons for their
forced separation from the company
As of this morning your employment
with CRT was officially terminated

PAUL
Wait wait wait --
The flashlight dims even more

ALAN DAVENPORT
It was brought to our attention
that you were engaging in relations
with a fellow CRT employee --
Pamela Gorham

PAUL
No Wait --

ALAN DAVENPORT
Stipulated in your contract was a
fraternization clause in which it
was stated quite clearly that any
relationship be it romantic or
sexual in nature deemed
inappropriate by CRT senior
officials is grounds for immediate
termination

PAUL
Wewe were just friends

ALAN DAVENPORT
Our records indicate differently

PAUL
This is bullshit

ALAN DAVENPORT
Were also legally required to
inform you that because you were
technically no longer under the
employ of CRT at the time of your
abduction we cannot be held
accountable for any injury that may
befall upon you after your official
date and time of termination
Therefore in your case that
includes this incident or any
consequences that may result from
it
Paul sees where Alan is going with this Hes thunderstruck

PAUL
What about my insurance money My
family will need that money

ALAN DAVENPORT
Given that you were alive up until
the time of your termination --

PAUL
You son of a bitch You cant do
this

ALAN DAVENPORT
Do you understand everything --

PAUL
You cant do this
Alan takes a second before trying again

ALAN DAVENPORT
Do you understand everything
youve been told Mister Conroy
Paul does not answer

ALAN DAVENPORT (CONTD)
Mister Conroy

After a long beat

PAUL
Go to hell

ALAN DAVENPORT
That concludes our interview with
Paul Conroy I am now turning off
the recorder

A click is heard The humming ceases

PAUL
You people cant just wash your
hands of this You bastards put me
here

ALAN DAVENPORT
Im sorry

Alan ends the call
Paul looks at the phone -- it is still holding a steady
signal Battery life however is running quite low All
that remains is one blinking bar indicating that Paul has
very little battery life left
He shakes his hand free of the pile of sand that now covers
it and looks at his watch Its 831pm
The flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely Only
tries

the

his

take

the light of the cell phone display lights the coffin

PAUL
Come on

Wasting little time Paul dials Jabir The phone rings and
rings but Jabir does not answer Checking to make sure the
he dialed the correct number Paul matches it against the
phone number he wrote onto the wall of the coffin

Seeing that he did in fact dial correctly Paul again

to call Jabir While he waits through the many rings he
tries relighting the Zippo Sparksparkit catches
No one answers Pauls disquietude is evident in his
increasingly erratic behavior

PAUL
Answer the phone
Paul tries Jabir once again but still he does not answer

phone

PAUL

(desperate exhausted)

Why wont you answer
Its then that something occurs to Paul He stares at the
crack in the top of the coffin and the sand that pours in at
an alarmingly fast rate
The crack has split Jabirs written phone number in half
The aerial bombing He wonders how it may have affected
Jabir and consequently his own chances of survival He
places his hand under the point from where the sand pours in
most allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through

fingers

The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of
oxygen

Paul attempts to control his breathing realizing full well
that there are not many more breaths he will be able to

He then calls Dan Brenner After a few rings Brenner
answers

Paul is surprisingly serene

DAN
Paul is that you

PAUL
Theyre dead

DAN
How do you know that

PAUL
I just do

DAN
Three F-16s levelled parts of the
city a few minutes ago

PAUL
I know I felt it Did they know
I was here
The Zippo flame flutters Weakens

DAN
(after a beat)
Yeah

PAUL

Did they care
Dan does not answer

PAUL (CONTD)
These people that took me -- if
theyre dead they cant tell you
where I am

DAN
We can still try to track down your
signal

PAUL
You tried that already

DAN
We can try again
Paul appreciates Dans effort but he knows there is little
hope left for him

PAUL (CONTD)
Its over isnt it
After a long beat

DAN
No
Paul doesnt say a word He knows that Dan is lying After
a beat Dan comes clean

DAN (CONTD)
Yeah

The flame of the Zippo becomes smaller It clearly has
little life left

PAUL
What should I do

DAN
I dont know
PAUL
Thats right -- just like everyone

else on the planet there are some
things you know and some things you

dont

DAN
I wish this could have gone
differently
PAUL

Yeahme too
After a long beat Paul ends the call He forces a smile to
his lachrymose face
Utterly hopeless he opens the phone and turns on the video
feature He turns the phone to face himself projecting his
image on the display
He presses Record

PAUL (CONTD)
This is Paul Steven Conroy Social
Security number 048-32-1198 date

testament To my wife Linda

Maybe I never said that
enoughmaybe I did I dont even

didnt

(BEAT)
Im sorry Linda I should have
listened to you
Paul ends the video and closes the phone He carefully
places the phone into his pocket where it may hopefully be
found if he ever is

He lays back staring at the almost completely extinguished
Zippo flame as the sand continues to rain on him

Down and down it pours the sands of time passing might and
main through the cracks

The Zippo flame goes out Paul sits in the darkness
resigned to what apparently will be his fate

Hold on black for several secondsuntil --

-- suddenly from inside Pauls pocket he hears a faint
vibration Its the cell phone He looks at the number of
who is calling him Shines the light of the cell phone on
the list of numbers written on the top of the coffin He
cant believe what hes seeing

Paul answers immediately

PAUL
Youre not dead
Jabir is heard speaking frantically in Arabic to the several
other people in the room with him

PAUL (CONTD)
Hello Hello
Jabir turns his attention to Paul

JABIR
Where is money

PAUL
I dont know

JABIR
What dont know

PAUL
I dont know where the money is

JABIR
Liar

PAUL
Im not lying I swear

JABIR
Swear

PAUL
Im telling the truth

Sounding panicked Jabir again speaks in Arabic to the other
people in the room with him They respond accordingly

Paul tries to turn on the flashlight It doesnt work

Jabir returns his scornful attention to Paul

JABIR
From Embassy you get money now
PAUL
I cant

JABIR
You will

PAUL
I need more time Please
Paul shakes and hits the flashlight It still does not work

JABIR
No more time

PAUL

Theres sand pouring in here I

cantits everywhere Please

let me out of here and I will get

you the money

Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next to
him seemingly asking a question and getting an answer from
the same individual

Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight Switches the
positioning of the batteries Screws the cap back on Hits
the switch

Nothing

Jabir returns to the phone

JABIR (CONTD)
You show blood

PAUL
What
Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again Removes the
batteries Bites down on them a few times Blows hard
inside the flashlight tube

JABIR
You show blood they give money

PAUL
No

JABIR
You cut off thumb finger send
video
PAUL

JABIR
Yes
Paul puts the batteries back inside the flashlight Begins
screwing on the cap

PAUL
No

JABIR
No

PAUL

Thats right no You let me out

of here and Ill cut off my whole

God damn hand if you want

Jabir again says something to someone in the room with him
returning to Paul after a brief moment

Paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight

JABIR
You have wife
Click The flashlight turns on

Paul considers Jabirs question to be a potential sign of
compassion

PAUL
Yes I do And a son A young
son I want to go hometo see

JABIR

PAUL

Even this basic knowledge is enough to make Jabirs threats
that much more real

PAUL
You looked at a map Thats all

JABIR

You show blood or they show blood

Send video by five minutes

Jabir ends the call Realizing that Jabir is gone Paul
quickly dials his wifes cell phone
After several rings her voice mail picks up

LINDA (VO)

Hi this is Linda Please leave a
message Thanks and have a great
day

PAUL

(FRANTICALLY)
Linda listen to me you and Shane
have to go somewhere anywhere
bound

(MORE)

PAUL (CONTD)
Dont stay at the house whatever
you do do not stay at the house
The guythe kidnapper he knows
our address He stole my license
and now he knows where we live Go
to the Sheriffs station if you
have to just dont go home
Paul hangs up He takes a moment to look around noticing
that the coffin is almost halfway filled with sand

PAUL (CONTD)
(re the sand)
Holy God
Paul then dials Dan Brenner After only one ring the call
goes directly to voice mail

The flashlight starts to dim Paul shakes it causing it to
regain its strength

DAN
This is Daniel Brenner Please
leave a message at the tone
The beep sounds Paul delivers a frenzied message

PAUL

Brenner where are you Hes

alive He just called me Call me

right away The fucking guy is

still alive

Paul hangs up the phone
Unsure what to do next Pauls heartbeat races He fidgets
nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone
He questions the validity of Jabirs threats toward his
family

PAUL

(TO HIMSELF)
They cant find them
Theycant Theres no way
Paul opens the phone and brings up the photo of Pamela

and gagged The image causes Paul to second guess himself
The flashlight goes out The cell phones display
illuminates Pauls face
shot

spreading

it

taken

He then replays the video in which Pamela is seen being

Reliving the experience is extremely painful though his
concern is more on his own family at this point However
the video is enough to convince Paul of Jabir and his
cohorts convictions

Paul tries the Zippo Nothing Only sparks He tosses it
aside

His breathing grows erratic and labored His eyes dart from
side-to-side his throat groans involuntary noises of fear
Paul then looks at the knife and then at his watch He has
less than two minutes to send the video to Jabir

Fearing for the safety of his family he must meet Jabirs
demands

He hits the flashlight a few times Click It turns on

Paul opens the phone and sets it to take video He places it
flat onto the surface of the sand which by this point is
already filling the coffin halfway He then reaches for the
nife

PAUL (CONTD)
Oh my God Oh my God
He places his hands against the side of the coffin

his fingers He stares intently at his thumb
With the extremely sharp knife in hand Paul slowly lowers

just above his thumb He inhales and exhales deep breaths
almost hyperventilating

PAUL (CONTD)
Holy shit
Paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired
glow sticks He shakes the sand off of it and places it
across his mouth biting into it hard
His heart races his breaths are the deepest hes ever

After placing the flashlight on the ground to ensure that
the camera picks up the image he presses the record button
on the cell phone

Grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a
primordial scream Paul closes his eyes and chops down with
the knife

We see through the display screen of the phone Paul sever
his thumb with a swift chop of the blade
stuffed

soaks

of

A small spray of blood spatters onto his face as he screams
out in unfathomable pain

He falls to his side still screaming and writhing He
reaches for his discarded outer-shirt which is still

in the crack to help slow the influx of sand Removing the
shirt from the crack instantly causes the sand to fall into
the coffin more rapidly

Paul wraps the shirt around his hand The blood quickly

right through it
He is fading fast His blood loss is great Shock sets in
He musters up the strength to send the video to Jabir

To secure his shirt over the wound Paul removes his belt
from his waist and pulls it tight over his wrap

Growing increasingly more pale Paul teeters on the verge of
consciousness Everything becomes blurry to him
The phone falls from his hand He shivers His lips turn a
light shade of purple and his face ash white Everything
becomes more and more blurry He fights with every last
ounce of strength to remain conscious
While laying against the side of the coffin the phone
vibrates once again To Paul the vibration against the wood
seems so distant so foreign The vibration grows louder and
louder in his mind sounding more and more like the sound of
rotating helicopter blades

He then hears what sounds like VOICES yelling from on top

the coffin

VOICE 1
Hes down here

VOICE 2
Get him out Keep digging

VOICE 3

Paul were here
The cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in Pauls
head each overlapping the other in distant echoes Shovels
digging deep into the ground are heard banging against the
top of the coffin
The top of the coffin is torn open sending a brilliant ray
of white light onto Paul He stares into the light crying
eking out a tortured smile

Suddenly Paul is back in the same predicament The voices

the shovels the light -- it was all a hallucination
brought

upon by his loss of blood

Hes still alone Hes still in the coffin which continues

to fill up with sand He is too exhausted to display his

disappointment

The phone continues to vibrate It soon stops Paul is in

too poor condition to show any concern

After a beat the phone begins vibrating once again After

several rings Paul languidly picks it up He barely

recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision

Hes so weak hes barely able to formulate words He spits

out stray particles of sand from his mouth

PAUL
Yeah

DAN
Paul its Brenner
Paul doesnt have the strength to answer

DAN (CONTD)
Paul Are you there Paul

PAUL
Imhere

DAN
Were coming for you now You hear
me We know where you are

This news serves as somewhat of an adrenaline rush for Paul
who musters up even the modicum of strength he seemingly did
not have left in him

PAUL
Youre coming

DAN
We are Paul Were almost there
now
PAUL
How do you know

DAN
Coalition forces picked up a Shiite
insurgent just outside of Baghdad

(MORE)

DAN (CONTD)
Said he knew where an American was
buried alive He agreed to show us
where if we let him go

PAUL
Youre coming for me

DAN
Were practically there already
An impossible smile fights its way to Pauls lips His
momentary joy is just that however for the sand has almost
completely filled the coffin by this point

PAUL
You have to hurry

DAN
We are

PAUL
Noyou have to hurry The
sandits filling up fast

DAN
Just hang in there for three more
minutes This will all be over
soon I promise
Paul is very hopeful that Dan is correct in his assumption

PAUL
Okay I believe you Thank you

A beep is heard Paul has another call coming in Hes
visibly elated upon seeing who it is

DAN
Three minutes Try to --
PAUL
I have to go

DAN
Paul no --

PAUL
Call me right back

DAN
Paul

PAUL
Call me right back
Paul switches to the other call despite the fact that he

has

a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is filled
with sand from top-to-bottom
He holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pile
allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area
remains

PAUL

Linda is in hysterics which is evident in her speech

LINDA

The flashlight continues to flicker almost like a
stroboscopic light from this point forward

PAUL

Linda breaks down in joyous tears

LINDA

LINDA

PAUL

Paul clicks over to the other line where Dan Brenner waits
to speak with him
We hear Dan yelling to people who are with him A great deal
of commotion and action is heard through the phone

DAN
Move Move Lets go

PAUL

DAN

PAUL

Dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him

DAN (CONTD)

Dan gets back on the phone with Paul

DAN (CONTD)
He brought us right to you

DAN (CONTD)
(to the soldiers)
Start digging Lets go lets go
The flashlight fades Paul hits it momentarily returning it
coffin

to full strength

Meanwhile the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the
very top It continues to pour in from the crack seemingly
faster than ever

Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand giving him
only a few inches between his face and the top of the

PAUL
You have to hurry Its almost
full

DAN

Just hang in there

PAUL
Hurry Please

DAN
(to the soldiers)
Dig Dig Dig
Paul fights to keep his head above the sand The flashlight
dims

PAUL

DAN

(MORE)

DAN (CONTD)

(TO PAUL)

The level of sand grows even higher Paul spits away falling
sand that threatens to suffocate him

PAUL
I cant hear you Where are you

DAN

A SOLDIER is heard OFF-SCREEN in the bg of Dans phone

SOLDIER (0S)

DAN
(to the soldiers)

Paul coughs out sand He has a mere inch left above his
head

PAUL

The Soldier is again heard OFF-SCREEN in the bg Of Dans
phone

SOLDIER

DAN
(to the soldier)

Nondescript noise is heard through the phone until it comes
to an abrupt stop

DAN

(SHOCKED)
Oh my God

PAUL

DAN

PAUL

DAN

letters on the top of the coffin

PAUL

DAN

(OVERLAPPING)
-I know Im sorry

PAUL
No

DAN
Im so sorry

PAUL

No No NO

The battery life on Pauls phone runs out causing it to
power down The filament of the flashlight bulb burns out
As it does the sand finally consumes the coffin filling it
completely

We hear Pauls muffled screams emanate through the sand
until we no longer hear them at all
FADE OUT
OVER BLACK

DAN
Im sorry Paul Im so sorry

THE END
