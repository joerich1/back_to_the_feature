INT OFFICE — DAY

A mass of non descript cubicles In the distance we hear a
VOICE Someone chanting to himself nervous

VOICE
Ive been with this company two
years I’ve ‘been with this

The CAMERA pushes through the maze of tiny cubicles trying to
find the disembodied voice past WORKERS routinely going
through their daily grind We finally find the man behind
the voice

STEVE BARKER

A pleasant looking guy in his early 30s who’s been
overlooked his entire life But not anymore Not today
Steve drums his fingers nervously takes a deep breath then
gets up from his cubicle

He walks down a series of hallways leading to a large
formidable looking office He knocks on the door and walks
inside

sitting at his desk He glances coldly up at Steve when he
finally notices him
