EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - MORNING

The morning sun beats down on a high school football stadium
It has a small town feel Enclosed by a track court it has
metal bleachers on either side It is morning but the sun is

already hot and blistering
A large man 40s can he seen walking along the - -empty field
He drinks from a bottle of water This is COACH WILLIS A

hard man Difficult He stops to fuss with a water
sprinkler head He jiggles it tugs on it He cant seem to-

get it to work
COACH WILLIS
Goddammit
He pullson it some more when something takes his attention

Something in the brittle grass He reaches for it curious
knocking over his bottle water in the process

“COACH WILLIS ‘fecns1d)--

A moment as Zeke watches him Closely Suddenly a NOISE
from the other side of the locker

PACEY (contd)

They move down the row of lockers not seeing the SHADOW
agaisnt the wall It is Marybeths SHADOW But not for
long The shadow changes shape It goes from the femimine
figure of a young woman to the hideous grotesque creature in

Pacey tries to quiet his TERRIFIED BREATHING

A SHADOW bounces across Paceys face He jumps up and moves

ON PACEY

Pacey listens He starts out when he sees the Creatures
shadow move against a locker He falls to his knees trying
to hide Waiting He watches in silent horror as the
Creatures neck elongates and its head rises up and over the
entire row of lackers

The Thing knows hes there its eyes pierce him Pacey looks
up sees it then hols shooting for the locker room door

Pacey moves down a row of lockers He sees Zekes body

slumped in a heap on the floor He goes to him Spots the

Bic pen and grabs it when he hears an ENORMOUS MONSTEROUS
WAIL ECHO through the locker room Pacey stops in his

tracks leaning against the equipment cage Suddenly

something grabs him from behind

Its Stokely still trapped in the cage

STOKELY
Hes over here

Pacey tears through the locker room door and into

INT GYM - NIGHT - SAME

Pacey comes-bolting out of the locker room door he doesnt
look back when the locker room door bursts Apart at the
Creatures touch

Pacey bolts moving across the basketball court He turns
to see the Thing slithering across the floor One of-its
tentacles SLINGS forward wrapping itself around Paceys leg
reeling him in Pacey slides across the floor KICKING and
SCREAMING He loses the Bic pen as it drops to the floor
His hands flail about as he tries to recover it His body
squirms like a hooked fish until the Creature stands over

Pacey lies directly underneath the Creature its four legs
on every side of him caging him in The Creatures head

appears on its snake-like neck twisting under and moving
close to Paceys face

The Creature is face to face with Pacey Its slimy feelers
slap about grazing his cheeks Its mouth opens as two long
worm-like tongues spit out

Pacey eyes the Creatures torsoits belly where the skin
is so translucent you can see through it Thousands of
small slugs swim aboutsome breaking the surface of the
skin then diving back under like dolphins in the ocean

Several fall onto Pacey They disappear inside his clothing

Pacey finds the Bic pen he brings it up to the Creatures
eye but the Creature dodges Pacey misses The slugs are
invading Paceys body He can feel them He starts —
SCREAMING and WRITHING about Pacey rolls away from the
Creature

Pacey stands upright and runs picking at the slugs imbedding
in his skin The Creature charges for Pacey tearing at

hin

Pacey eyes the bleachers He goes for them diving under
themhitting the electric lever on the wall as he goes

KABOOM

The electric bleachers begin to closerecoiling up within

each other

UNDER THE BLEACHERS

Pacey races through the maze of metal that comprises the
underlining of the bleachers

He sprints dodging the steel braces as they snap flat around

‘him He looks behind him to see

THE CREATURE
right behind hin trafficking the folding bleachers as well

Pacey runs the length of them trying to get to the other
side before they close completely

The bleachers are almost completely gone Space is tight
Pacey LEAPS in one final jolt of adrenaline He makes it

flyingSMASHING into the gym wal

( )

Lose

He turns to see the Thing just as the last bleacher snaps
closed SMASHING THE CREATURE FLAT Only its head escapes
stretching forth coming at Pacey who meets it dead center
with the Bic pen imbedding it with warrior force right in
the Creatures middle eye

The Creature goes mad its head convulsing and shaking An
unfathomed SCREAM erupting from ITS mouth

A long moment as the Creature finally comes to a
stilldead Pacey looks down the slugs on his body fall

away Dead too

Pacey stares a long hard moment until hes completely
satisfied the Creature is dead

Then he rises ta his feet He goes racing toward the locker
room

INT LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Pacey moves to the equipment cage He looks down to see
Stokely lying on the floor unconscious A dead slug lay at

her nostril
Pacey unlocks it moves inside touches her

PACEY

Stokely stirs Shes alive

STOKELY
Jesus Pacey--is it over

PACEY
Yeah Are you okay

STOKELY

When theyre in you--you cant feel them
You dont know theyre there
Stokely hugs Pacey He helps her up when
A BODY COMES CRASHING AGAINST THE CAGE

Pacey and Stokely SCREAM in terror They look up to see
Zeke in pain clutching his wounds

Pacey smiles happy to see hin They all share a moment
looking at each other
