A NIGHT SKY

Ominous black clouds roll across the heavens THUNDER begins
to RUMBLE within the clouds An unsettling feeling of
approaching danger

Deep shadowed woods A quiet breeze rustles some dry leaves
NOISY CRICKETS Some unseen creature runs through the bush

to build We PRESS IN on Tommy HEARING his horrid memories

gloves from his jacket Putting them on he then attempts to
remove the spear He cant get proper leverage So Tommy
jumps down into Jasons grave
