FOR EDUGATIONA
- DURPOSES ON

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

A cold windy evening in New England Bare looming trees

line the sides of the desolate road Suddenly the

darkness

is broken by fast approaching LIGHTS We see a speeding Land

Rover round a bend
INT LAND ROVER - NIGHT

We pull in from the rear revealing a mess of books

and

clothing including a distinctive BLACK PARKA Driving the
car is a cute curly-haired twenty year-old MICHELLE
MANCINI She listens attentively to a “Lovelines” style talk

show on the radio

SASHA (0S)
Youre listening to After Dark with Sasha
on WVOP the Voice of Pendelton
University Caller you’re on the air

JANE (0S)

SASHA
(sarcastic)

roommate

SASHA

JANE
No I don’t think so But honestly

and smell the coffee over at Ellens
house because you are way confused Head
immediately to the lesbian student lobby

come to terms see if roomie wouldn’t be
up for a little Sapphic soul searching
Thank you next caller

Michelle laughs then pops a tape into the stereo Bonnie
Tyler’s 80s power ballad “Total Eclipse of the Heart”
starts BLASTING Michelle sings along not too convincingly

MICHELLE
Turn aroundevery now and then I get a
little bit terrified and then I see the
look in your eyes

The sunroof is open and the moon softly illuminates Michelle
She’s too entertained to notice a FLASHING LIGHT on the
consolethe low fuel gauge She speeds past a large Shell
station

INT LAND ROVER - NIGHT

The car begins sputtering She turns the radio down and
notices the light and accompanying BEEPING

MICHELLE
(panicked
Oh no

Through the windshield she sees a rundown gas station in the
distance

MICHELLE (contd)
Pleaseplease make it

The car is on its last fume It sputters into the station
and dies Michelle breathes a sigh of relief A creepy
disheveled ATTENDANT steps out of his office and walks to the
car Michelle opens the window just a crack

ATTENDANT
(stuttering)
R-r-ran out of g-g-g-gas

MICHELLE (cont’d)
Yeah Fill it up please

She slips her credit card through the crack He stares at
her nods and walks away

MICHELLE (cont’d)
(to herself)
Freak show
EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT
The gas hose is in the tank filling up

She grabs mace spray and sticks it in her coat pocket
INT OFFICE - NIGHT

It’s dark and dingy the only light a dim flickering
fluorescent bulb Michelle steps inside and the attendant

immediately closes the door behind her locking it with a
key

MICHELLE
So where’s the phone
ATTENDANT
(nervously)
M-m-m-issT-t-t-here-
MICHELLE’S POV

On the desk sits the phoneunplugged from the wall She
slowly begins to walk backwards towards the door

ATTENDANT (cont’d)

He goes to grab her shoulders

MICHELLE

She reaches the doorit’s locked He grabs her shoulders
firmly and turns her to face him

She grabs the mace and fidgets around trying to remove the
protective lock

ATTENDANT (contd)

She unlocks the mace shoves it in front of his eyes and
sprays

ATTENDANT (contd)
AAAAAHHHH

The attendant keels over

MICHELLE tries in vain to unlock the door She turns around
and sees

THE ATTENDANT writhing in pain on the floor

ON THE DESK she spots the unplugged phone and grabs it

il 6

She SMASHES the door window until there’s an opening big
enough for her to fit through Her gloves and coat protect
her from the glass
EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT 7
Shes halfway out
INT OFFICE - NIGHT 8
The attendant gets up Her legs are dangling inside He
grabs them She SCREAMS and starts kicking hitting him in
the groin
ATTENDANT (cont ’‘d)

OHHH
EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT 9

Michelle falls out and runs to her car She’s fumbling
around with her keys when

THE ATTENDANT opens the office door He’s approaching She
can’t find the right key He’s almost there Finally she
gets the key and leaps inside

INT LAND ROVER - NIGHT 10

She starts the engine and looks around He’s nowhere in
sight when --

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT ll

HE JUMPS in front of the car shining menacingly in the
headlights

ATTENDANT

INT LAND ROVER - NIGHT 12

Michelle hits the accelerator SMASHING into the attendant
He’s clinging onto the hood

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT 13
The gas hose flies out of the tank spilling gasoline all over

the ground Michelle makes a sharp turn into the road and
the attendant falls off

13

He gets up and hobbles to the road trying to chase after the
car It’s useless He yells out and finally his words
come out without a stutter

ATTENDANT
THERES SOMEONE IN THE BACKSEAT

INT LAND ROVER - NIGHT 14

She’s already too far to hear his warning As she sobs
hysterically she doesnt notice

BEHIND HER
the black parka wed seen earlier begin to move slightly
CLOSE ON STEREO
She presses “Play” on the tape player “Total Eclipse of the
Heart” again She sings along trying to make herself feel
better
MICHELLE

Turn around bright eyesevery now and

then I fall apartTurn around bright
BEHIND HER
The FIGURE in the black parka rises His face obscured by a
furry hood He raises an ax and begins to inch towards
Michelle
CLOSE ON REARVIEW MIRROR
Hanging from it is a blue and gold TASSEL with “96” pinned to
it Michelle looks in the mirror It’s completely black
She adjusts it and catches the reflection of the fur-trimmed
parka hood She turns around
HES RIGHT BEHIND HER

Her eyes widen The SONG is reaching its crescendo “Turn
aroundevery now and then I fall apart”

MICHELLE
NOOO000000

CLOSE ON THE AX

The killer swings With a squishy THUD her head is sliced
and flies straight out the sunroof

EXT ROAD - NIGHT 15

The head rolls over the top of the car mouth agape eyes
widened in terror and rolls RIGHT TOWARDS US until its mouth
fills the entire screen

SLAM CUT TO
A MOUTH yawning

EXT PENDELTON CAMPUS - NIGHT 16

Pull back to reveal NATALIE SIMON a dark-haired good
looking twenty year-old staring straight ahead

Natalie’s a serious type-A personality whod probably feel
more comfortable in a Donna Karan power suit than the green
goose down jacket she’s currently donning She knows exactly
what she wants out of life and has no time to wasteher Day
Runner is her bible

NATALIE
I won’t encourage this

HER POV

A Gothic stone building Its windows boarded with wood and
its front door locked with a heavy chain The molding abov
the front door clearly reads “Stanley Hall”

Next to her stands her friend BRENDA She’s tall and
athletic and blonde Her carefree demeanor the antithesis to
Natalie

BRENDA
Cut me a little slack I just
transferred here this year Now do I say
Bloody Mary five or six times before I
hear the spirits

NATALIE
Brenda give it up Youre not exactly
the midget lady from “Poltergeist”

BRENDA
Are you scared Natalie

Natalie laughs
NATALIE

(sarcastic)
Right

16

Brenda grabs Natalie by the arm and pulls her towards the
dorm

NATALIE (contd)
Here we go

Brenda stops in front of a window and peers in through a
crack

BRENDA
Bloody Mary -

Natalie rolls her eyes

BRENDA (cont’‘d)
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary Bloody Mary

Brenda looks at Natalie Takes a deep breath and
NATALIE
(okay Im over this)
Bloody Mary
Suddenly we hear what sound like far-off tortured SCREAMS
Brenda and Natalie look at one another They’re nervous
The SCREAMS are getting louder and louder

NATALIE
Come on

They start to back away when

A FIGURE appears behind them holding a light under his face
They turn around and SCREAM

DAMON
BUAAAAAA

He LAUGHS hysterically It’s Damon goateed frat brother and
campus practical joker

DAMON (cont’‘d)
You called

NATALIE
She was trying to summon the dead Damon
not frat boys with badly grown facial
hair

Damon instinctively touches his goatee

(

16 16
DAMON
What do you mean It took me a month to
get this

Natalie smirks He smiles at her flirtatiously

DAMON (cont’d)
Anywayit‘ll still tickle you in all
the right spots

NATALIE
Keep dreaming man-boy

BRENDA
(angry)
So is this what you do with your free
time Hang out in the rain by yourself
waiting to scare people like a total
freak

DAMON
Nah Only when I see some idiot standing
in front of the dorm trying to summon the
dead

He points to the frat house behind them
DAMON (cont’d)
I can see you through my window Night
girls See ya in class tomorrow

BRENDA
Unfortunately

NATALIE
See ya

He walks away Natalie puts her arm around Brenda
NATALIE (cont‘d)
Don’t tell me tomorrow were breaking
out the Ouija board and getting fashion
tips from Versace
Brenda shrugs her shoulders

BRENDA
Not a bad idea

They look at each other and laugh

INT PENDELTON COLLEGE RADIO BOOTH - NIGHT 17

Small and cramped with posters of obscure college rock bands
hanging on the walls A window looks onto the engineering
room where the ENGINEER sits slouching over the controls

We see a heavily made up perfectly accessorized college girl
standing with a wireless mike headset This is SASHA whose
voice we heard earlier She commands the airwaves like a hip
and sexy Dr Ruth and becomes very animated as she speaks

BIJOU (0S)
(overmodu lated)
HELLO

Sasha turns around snaps her finger at the engineer and
motions with her hand for him to lower the levels He
quickly obliges

SASHA
Yes Im here

BIJOU
(nervously)
Um Wellit’s kinda um embarrassing

SASHA
Spit it out Bijou

BIJOU
That’s the problem I didn’t

SASHA
Oh Getting a little extra protein in
your diet huh

BIJOU
(breaking up)
My stomach’s been killing me ever since
Sasha I think I can feel them swimming
around in there Do I need to get my
stomach pumped

SASHA

Bijou I think the only thing you need
pumped is the air out of your head
Swallowing is a major safe sex no-no
Now sounds to me like there’s nothing
wrong with your stomach that a shot of
Pepto wouldnt cure Don’t stress and
next time make sure to climb off that
volcano before it erupts Next caller

INT JAVA JOINT - NIGHT 18

The campus coffee shop Over the radio Sasha’s radio show
is PLAYING Natalie and Brenda sit in couches next to a
CRACKLING fireplace along with two guys PARKER and PAUL
Notepads and textbooks fill the table in front of them

Natalie turns to PARKER older than the others and wearing a
Sigma Epsilon sweatshirt Parker has been at Pendelton for
seven years and has no intention on graduating just yet Why
bother dealing with real responsibility when youre the best
known party guy on campus

NATALIE
Parker how exactly does Sasha come up
with this stuff

PARKER
She devours every issue of Cosmo Calls
it her bible

BRENDA (contd)
(anxious)
So finish the story

PARKER
Anyway he was a professor on campus
Maybe twenty-five thirty years ago

BRENDA
What did he teach

PARKER
I dont knowbiology or something

PAUL the sexy and soft-spoken journalist sits next to
Brenda He’s quiet and listens intently The kind of guy
who seems to be able to read you with one glance

PAUL
It was actually abnormal psychology from
what I understand

PARKER
Not the point of the story but fine
abnormal psych it is Anyway he flipped
out one night Went completely berserk
Grabbed his hunting knife and headed into
Stanley Hall Banged on every door And
every student that answered he took that
knife and slit their throats Ear to
ear

He demonstrates it with a butter knife

Again

PARKER (contd)
Did away with an entire floor before
stabbing himself straight through the
heart

he demonstrates with the butter knife

PARKER (cont’d)
UGGHthus the annual Sigma Epsilon
bash

BRENDA
You have a frat party to commemorate a
massacre

NATALIE
(sarcastic)
Any excuse to get plastered

PARKER
(grinning broadly)
You betcha

PAUL
So Parker when this happened you were
what a sophomore here

The group laughs

PARKER
You can laugh but like I’ve said before
I really see no point in graduating
before thirty

PAUL
What do you think Natalie You buy it

NATALIE
A massacre Of course not It’sa
bullshit story you hear on every campus
in the Northeast Show me the proof

PARKER

Well that’s the thing Pendelton knew
enrollment would suffer permanently so
in cahoots with the national news media
and various other powerful
organizationsthey’ve done their best
to eliminate any information relating to
it 18

NATALIE
Yeah I‘m so sure
Suddenly there’s loud BEEPING Paul checks his pager

PAUL
Just a sec

He stands up and brushes against Brenda She eyes him
longingly Brenda turns to Natalie as he walks away

BRENDA
Did you see how he brushed against my
leg

NATALIE
How

BRENDA

Slowly Like a seduction

NATALIE
I say he’s into it

BRENDA
I don’t know He’s good-looking smart
Straight Not the type that usually goes
for me

NATALIE
Brenda stop being so down on yourself
The leg brushit’s a sign

BRENDA
Should I ask him out

NATALIE
Let him come to you

PARKER
Yo Don’t mind including me in some of
your chick banter

Paul walks back

PAUL
Something’s come up I gotta get to the
newsroom

NATALIE

Another e-coli crisis in the cafeteria 18

PAUL

student Pulitzer

He winks at her smiles and exits

BRENDA

NATALIE
Okay guys Ive got a scary story too
The group of lazy college kids who
flunked out and ended up making blizzards
at Dairy Queen

She opens up her book Parker and Brenda GROAN in unison

EXT RESIDENCE HALL - NIGHT 19
Natalie is fumbling with her keys Suddenly the door swings
open taking Natalie aback Holding the door is a wrinkled
gray-haired JANITOR with a friendly demeanor

JANITOR

INT DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT 20
Natalie walks in

NATALIE

JANITOR
(smiling)

SHUT OFF THE FUCKING LIGHT

Sheturns to find TOSH her gothic manic-depressive roommate
in bed with a guy

We see the room Natalie’s half is neat and clean The
walls of Tosh’s half are painted black and Marilyn Manson
posters hang from the wall It’s a sty

NATALIE

She turns off the light
INT NATALIES ROOM - NIGHT 22

Natalie lies in bed looking away as Tosh and the guy MOAN in
ecstasy She grabs her pillow and covers her ears

CUT TO
INT LECTURE HALL - MORNING 23

A large auditorium style room On the chalkboard it reads
“Intro to American Folklore” The class is restlessno
sign of the instructor In the middle of the classroom sit
Natalie and Brenda Behind them Parker and Damon Parkers
eating a bagel and a brown PAPER BAG sits on his desk Damon
is staring at the overhead clock It reads 909

DAMON
I’m telling you it’s ten minutes

PARKER
Bud I’ve been here six years If the
professor has tenure which Wexler does
you wait twenty minutes If not ten’s
the max

DAMON
(looking at clock)
5-4-3-2-1outta here

He stands up Just as he does the door swings open
PROFESSOR WEXLER middle-aged and wearing an obvious toupee
walks in He sees Damon

PROF WEXLER
Going somewhere Damon

23

DAMON
Me No Just stretching

He stretches his arms exaggeratedly and sits back down

PROF WEXLER
Good Lights please

The eager TEACHER’S ASSISTANT hits the lights and turns on
the slide machine

PROF WEXLER (contd)
Last week we discussed folklore as a
gauge for the values and concerns of the
society that created them Today we get
more specific

The slide machine CLICKS to a spooky drawing of a darkened
living room In the background a man in shadow is walking
down a staircase while a frightened and oblivious teenage
girl sits on a couch phone up to her ear

PROF WEXLER (cont’d)
A baby-sitter receives menacing phone
calls and upon tracing them realizes
they’re originating from the upstairs
room The room where shes left the
children under her care to sleep Whos
heard this before

Most of the class raises their hands

BRENDA
That really happened to a girl in my old
town so

PROF WEXLER

(sarcastic)
Yes I’m sure it did I’m sure most of
you think this happened to girls in all
of your hometowns But it didn’t The
baby-sitter and the man upstairs is an
urban legend contemporary folklore
passed on as a true story There are
variations of this tale dating back to
the 60’s All of them containing the
same cultural admonition young women
mind your children or harm will come your
way

Damon leans over and whispers in Natalie’s ear 23
DAMON
What’s the chance that a better head rug
will come his way
Natalie LAUGHS Wexler turns around and sees her
PROF WEXLER
Something funny you’d like to share with

us Natalie

NATALIE
No Mr Wexler

He stares at her hard
PROF WEXLER
Well then why don’t you come down here
and volunteer for my experiment

NATALIE
Experiment

PROF WEXLER
Don’t worry Youll probably survive

Natalie takes a deep breath and stands up She looks back to
find Damon and Parker trying to conceal their laughter

FRONT OF THE CLASS
Wexler hands Natalie a packet of Pop Rocks

PROF WEXLER
Had these before

NATALIE

Pop Rocks Sure They crackle in your
mouth

PROF WEXLER
Eat some

She pours the candy into her mouth It’s POPPING

PROF WEXLER (contd)
Thirsty

Wexler holds out a can of Coke Natalie instinctively spits
out

WEXLER
Is there something you might have heard
about mixing pop rocks and coke 23

NATALIE
Well supposedly your stomach
intestines everythingbursts

WEXLER
Really Anyone you know died this way

NATALIE
Mikey From the Life cereal commercial
You know “Give it to Mikey Hell eat
anything”

The slide machine CLICKS A still of Mikey from the
commercial appears

WEXLER
You mean him

NATALIE
Yeah

Another CLICK A picture of a smiling middle-aged man
appears on screen

WEXLER (cont’‘d)
What if I told you this is Mikey today
Alive and well and working as an ad
executive in New York Would you eat it
then
Natalie looks around the class All eyes on her

NATALIE
I think I‘ll pass

Wexler looks disappointed Suddenly Damon stands up

DAMON
Ill do it

Damon walks down and grabs the Pop Rocks He swallows it
down with a swig of Coke Hes fine

WEXLER
Again nothing more than an urban legend

Suddenly Damon falls to the floor The class GASPS He’s
spasming uncontrollably as pop rocks drool down the side of
his mouth

Parker jumps up from his seat 23

PARKER
HE’S GONNA EXPLODE

Brenda SCREAMS and runs out of the room BOOM It sounds
like somethings burst The entire class stands and stares
at Damon who suddenly jumps up and laughs hysterically He
pulls out the paper bag he was hiding under his coat

The class bursts into LAUGHTER Wexler shakes his head and
rolls his eyes

PROF WEXLER (contd)
All right children shall we move on

EXT CAMPUS QUAD - DAY 24

Natalie and Brenda step out from the classroom building

NATALIE
You actually thought Damon was going to
explode

BRENDA

Well I didn’t want to take the chance of
getting intestinal splatter on my outfit

They turn a corner and stop dead in their tracks
THEIR POV

A couple of police cars are parked in front of the student
union Over by the newsstand a crowd has gathered

BRENDA (contd)
Whats going on

Natalie shrugs her shoulders As they walk towards the
crowd a passing GIRL drops a copy of the Pendelton Daily
newspaper Natalie picks it up On the front page is a
huge New York Post style headline that reads “IS THERE A
LUNATIC ON CAMPUS There’s a big picture of Michelle
Mancini in the middle

NATALIE stares at the paper shocked
BRENDA (cont‘d)
(freaking ‘out)
You’ve gotta be kidding me I knew I
shouldve gone to NYU

PAUL (0S)
(proud)
Can you believe the trouble I’m causing

24

They turn around and find Paul behind them

BRENDA
Hi Paul

He smiles at her for a second before something catches his
eye over her shoulder

HIS POV

The patrician middle-aged college dean ROGER ADAMS is
standing on the steps of the student union clutching a copy
of the newspaper Next to him is a young black woman in a
security uniform This is REESE campus head of security
She has a determined intense look in her eyes

The Dean turns to a couple of young INTERNS and whispers to
them They immediately walk down and through the crowd and
begin confiscating the papers from the newstand

PAUL
Hey

He runs over to the interns

PAUL (cont’d)
What the hell are you doing

They ignore him He looks at the Dean and runs over to him

PAUL (cont‘d
You can’t just seize every copy here

The Dean stares at him harshly

DEAN ADAMS
You‘re the one that wrote this
misconstrued sensationalistic piece of
rubbish didn’t you

PAUL
Sure did

DEAN ADAMS
Let me tell you something young man as
far as I’m concerned the only lunatic on
this campus is you

PAUL
I’m flattered

He takes out his tape recorder 24

PAUL (cont‘d)
May I quote you on that

The Dean rolls his eyes and walks away Reese steps up to
the recorder

REESE
I have a comment US News and World
Report named Pendelton the safest
university in the country I call it the
safest university in the Western
Hemisphere and I intend to keep it that
way with or without your help

She turns around and follows the Dean

PAUL
Thank you Reese

He turns to Natalie and Brenda

PAUL (contd)
Well I guess I’m on the administration
hit list again

NATALIE
(to Brenda)
Let‘s get out of here

Paul turns to Natalie and Brenda and holds up his recorder

PAUL
Wait how about some interviews
Students reacts to tragedy on campus

packet up from the bottom of the closet On it is a very
80s looking picture of a heavily made up girl being
attacked and holding up “The Shrieker” screaming device
She takes the device out of the box and sticks it in her
pocket

dumbfounded It’s furious now Like he’s trying to scratch
his way inside the car She jumps up and again tries the

We see bare feet furiously scratching the roof Then as we
go up further we realize it’s Damon He’s hung by a rope He
keeps himself from being choked by holding onto his neck He
can barely get his words out

DAMON
(breathlessly)
Don’t start the car Don’t start the
car

INT DAMON’S CAR - NIGHT 34
Natalie is still feverishly attempting to get the car

Presses her face against the glass attempting to see what is
happening on the roof when suddenly

THE KILLER’S HEAD pops down from over the car right in front
of her

scanning Suddenly we hear distinct FOOTSTEPS Natalie
stops in her tracks and looks around The air is heavy with
dust

other We hear the THUD of a book drop It could be
anywhere

book she’s been searching for “Encyclopedia of Urban
Legends” It’s a heavy volume She grabs it with both hands

She tries typing “help” on the computer screen The killer
hits a button and shuts off the computer Before it goes

rolls Tosh in her desk chair over to her bed She tries to

Now Natalie I know youre dealing with a
lot right now Suicide --

NATALIE
Tosh was murdered

He closes his eyes and tenses up for a second then looks up
and smiles

DEAN ADAMS
Why do you two insist on creating an
unnecessary atmosphere of paranoia in my
school Hmm

PAUL
Tell us about Stanley Hall Dean

Reese’s ears prick up
DEAN ADAMS
Its awhat do you call it An urban
legend You hear that on every college
campus

NATALIE
But it had to originate somewhere

PAUL
Was Wexler involved

The Dean is silent
DEAN ADAMS
Natalie maybe youd care to shed a
little light on something I noticed on
your file

NATALIE
What is that

DEAN ADAMS
Your probation for reckless endangerment

No response from Natalie Paul looks at her eyebrow raised

(

NATALIE
That was in high school

DEAN ADAMS
I know Happened after you’d already
been accepted to Pendelton Youre
lucky The admissions office might have
not looked upon a criminal record very
favorably otherwise Would you care to
elaborate

Natalie looks at Paul then at the Dean

NATALIE
No I wouldnt That has nothing to do
with what‘s happening

DEAN ADAMS
Natalie there is nothing happening except
two completely unrelated tragedies
Now I want to be as supportive as
possible but you’re skating on thin ice
right now So I’m requesting you take an
academic leave of absence through the end
of the semester Itll do you some good
to deal with what’s happening back home
with your family

NATALIE
So that’s it that’s how you’re going to
handle this By sending me away

The Dean is silent Paul stands up

PAUL
Let’s get out of here

DEAN ADAMS
I’m not through yet You’re off the
paper Paul This institutions had
enough of your inflammatory articles

PAUL
What You can’t do this There’s
something in the constitution called
freedom of speech

DEAN ADAMS
The constitution doesn’t protect someone
who wrongfully yells “fire” in a crowded
theater And Paul youve yelled fire
one too many times on this campus

(MORE) 78
DEAN ADAMS (contd)
(a pause)
Enjoy your weekend

No response from Natalie

PAUL (contd)
Natalie I just lost a lot in there
following your lead So maybe I have a
right to know a little about your past

NATALIE
It‘s not something I wanna discuss

PAUL
You don’t wanna discuss it Okay Do
you want to discuss my career options
without a body of writing samples
Because FYI Natalie theyre kind of
limited

NATALIE
Paul whatever happened it doesn’t
change the fact that someone on this
campus is killing people

PAUL
It doesn’t I don’t know if I buy it
anymore Honestly Natalie I don’t know
if I ever bought it

NATALIE

hospital operating room tray with medical equipment
including a large SCALPEL The Killer in the parka appears
Takes off the hood It’s Brenda She smiles at Natalie

BRENDA
Gotcha

Natalie looks at her in disbelief

BRENDA (contd)
I must say youve proved your friendship
to me Natalie Coming to my rescue
without even a little pepper spray to
defend yourself Very endearing

Natalie tries to talk through the gag

clipping appears The headline “Teenager Killed in Apparent
Gang Initiation”

BRENDA
You werent driving But it was your car
Natalie And you were there Didn’t you
tell me something about not being able to
forgive yourself Well I thought as a
friend I could help you out in that
area

Brenda stares at the picture There’s a trace of sadness in

But just for a second She turns back to Natalie

BRENDA (cont’d)
The reporters immediately jumped on the
gang story because it was so much more
interesting than a couple of ditzy
cheerleaders playing a practical joke

NATALIE
They made the correction the next day

BRENDA
Too late The urban legend had already
spread You two never even spent a night
in jail for what you did Payback’s a
bitch isn’t it Natalie

NATALIE
Please Brenda you need to get help

BRENDA
I told you I already tried therapy
Obviously did me no good I must say I
kinda enjoyed all of this Playing with
your head You used an urban legend to
kill my boyfriend and now

Brenda laughs She walks to the tray and grabs the scalpel

NATALIE
What are you gonna do

BRENDA
Just my fave UL The kidney heist You

BRENDA
Of course I will I’ve got the perfect
murderer in the trunk of Paul’s
carWexler

NATALIE

BRENDA
This was his room you know He probably
slept in that same bed when that crazy
professor came and tried to kill him
Twenty-five years ago this weekend It’s
a pattern Tonight he does away with
students and kills himselfin the same
manner as the course he teaches It’s so
clean isn’t it The symmetry of it all
Well enough chat

to Natalie’s side

BRENDA (contd)
Unfortunately I have no anesthesia
Sorry Youll just have to bite real
hard on the gag and hopefully go into
shock soon enough

NATALIE
Please don’t do this

BRENDA
Don’t you want to become an urban legend
Natalie All your friends are now

Brenda lifts up Natalies shirt

and traces over Natalie’s skin Blood is coming out of the
cut Through the gag Natalie is SCREAMING in terror
