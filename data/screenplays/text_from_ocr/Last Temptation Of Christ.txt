EXT NAZARETH - MORNING

From above Flying close over a thick grove of olive trees
MUSIC fades into the sound of wings beating through the air
We hear (OVER) the voice of a young man thoughtful but
strong

JESUS (VO)
The feeling begins Its a light
tingling at first Right on the top
of my head Very tender Like a
caress Soft wings carrying me to
Paradise Then the pain starts

Now we see JESUS the son of Mary 28 years-old sleeping
under an olive tree The mid-morning sun (OVER-EXPOSED) shines
on his stubby face He is dreaming

JESUS (VO)

It feels like the bird has grabbed
me from behind Just above the neck
Talons slip underneath the skin and
work and claw their way up the back
of my neck Then the real pain begins
Each claw digs into the soft matter
behind my brain and then across the
top of my head toward my eyes Just
before they reach my eyes they dig
down

Jesus wakens He looks around

JESUS (VO)
And I remember I have to make a
cross

While he is still speaking he reaches up to touch the back
of his head where the pain started He pulls his fingers
away There is blood on them

CUT TO

INT CARPENTERS WORKSHOP - DAY

Jesus shapes a long piece of timber with an adze His patched
tunic rests on the workbench Walls are hung with tools

A nail-studded belt hangs from a hook above his head The
belt is speckled with dried blood Two drops of fresh blood
drip off the belt onto the ground

JESUS (VO)
At first I fasted for three months
Then I whipped myself before sleeping
At first it worked then the headaches
returned I know its God Or the
devil Who can tell them apart They
exchange faces God sometimes becomes
all darkness the devil all light
and they become confused in my mind

Outside there are NOISES of a crowd gathering nearby
Undistracted he finishes off the piece of timber which has
become the crossbar of a cross He places the crossbar between
two brackets on the wall then puts himself halfway between
them and stretches out his arms gauging the proper
proportion

CUT TO
EXT NAZARETH STREET - DAY

Narrow and crowded with citizens on their way to a
crucifixion A ROMAN SOLDIER watches them with professional
disinterest His armour is non-existent his uniform is
certainly not splendid He looks like a sloppy traffic cop
PEOPLE come from behind him and walk in front

Over the soldiers left shoulder appears a man with blazing
red hair and beard moving with the crowd He walks close
behind the soldier for just a moment Very professionally
he cuts his throat The soldier falls to the ground The man
keeps walking calmly and the camera follows as in the
background people start to notice that a soldier has been
stabbed

A WOMAN screams Two other MEMBERS of the crowd grab her and
silence her while SEVERAL OTHERS drag the body off into a
hut
The red-haired man keeps walking This is JUDAS

CUT TO

EXT NAZARETH CARPENTERS WORKSHOP - DAY

Jesus looks toward the door almost as if he has felt the
murder
JESUS (VO)
Who is it Who are you Why are you
following me

Judas enters sees Jesus working on the cross

JUDAS
Are you ready

Jesus doesnt answer

JUDAS
I said are you ready

He grabs him Jesus still doesnt answer He keeps working

JUDAS
Youre a disgrace

Jesus smiles at him

JESUS
Im the disgrace Judas I see the
blood on your knife

Judas lets go of him He takes the knife from inside his
cloak and removes it from its scabbard He wipes the blood
off the blade with a rag

JUDAS
Come with us Help us

JESUS
Leave me alone

JUDAS
No This time you wont finish

He grabs Jesus hands and holds them

JUDAS
Listen Everythings ready Were
going to save the Zealot He could
be the one weve been waiting for
You cant just pray for the Messiah
Youve got to help him You cant
expect God to do everything He needs
our help too
JESUS
Hell have to do it without me

JUDAS
You might be killing the Messiah
This Zealot today is not like all
the others I feel it Hes different
Dont finish the cross Come with
us Dont you want to be part of it
You want the Romans to be here
forever

JESUS
The Messiah has nothing to do with
the Romans

JUDAS
Yes he does How else do you expect
to be free If this Zealot is the
Messiah and we dont save him then
hell die and well never know But
if we save him the miracle might
happen

JESUS
What miracle

JUDAS
The sign the signal The royal crown
of David will shine on his head

JESUS
It cant be much of a miracle if we
have to help

JUDAS
Youre not even ashamed

JESUS
No

JUDAS
Romans cant find carpenters to make
crosses Except for you You throw
yourself into it like a madman
Everybody thinks youre crazy But
not me I can see through this act
of yours Fainting hearing voices
having visions Everyone thinks youre
a madman But I know what your are
Youre an enemy Youre worse than

the Romans Youre a Jew whos killing
Jews And youre not ashamed You
dont even have any pride

JESUS
No I dont have any pride I dont
go to Synagogue I disobey the
commandments I work on the Sabbath
Your Messiahs You find them Ill
crucify them

Judas hits Jesus across the mouth

JUDAS
Youre lucky youre a Jew

JESUS
Why

JUDAS
Anyone else would have been dead by
now You think Zealots are murderers
Were pathfinders were patriots
and youre in the way

JESUS
Then get me out of the way

Judas and Jesus stare each other down

JUDAS
I will In my time Not yours When
Im told

JESUS
When did you ever need permission to
kill anybody

JUDAS
To kill a Roman never To killa
Jew we all have to agree We have
more respect for Jews than you do
The next time I see you youre dead

EXT CARPENTERS WORKSHOP — DAY
A CENTURION pushes his way through a small crowd

Jesus stands ready outside the workshop the crossbar resting
against a wall The crowd is taunting him with cries of
Crossmaker Traitor Cooperator Collaborator but
he ignores them

Someone throws something A MAN in the crowd deliberately
jostles him roughly trying to start a fight The Centurion
breaks things up

CENTURION

Leave him alone You ready
(as Jesus nods)

Come on

Jesus buckles the nail-studded belt around his waist The
Centurion helps Jesus heft the cross-beam to his shoulders
The Centurion leads Jesus through a gauntlet the crowd has
formed from the village to the crucifixion site on the edge
of Nazareth Ahead six Roman soldiers lead the protesting
ZEALOT Two mounted soldiers flank the group The Zealots
hands are tied behind him His clothes are torn and bloody
his long hair and grey beard matted with blood and sweat

ZEALOT
Youre the people of Israel God is
with us Hes judging us now Fight

The soldiers push him along

MAN IN CROWD
How long do we have to wait for the
Messiah

ANOTHER MAN
Until you die Because hes not
coming

WOMAN IN CROWD
He forgot about us He doesnt want

us

YOUNG MAN
Listen to the Zealot God is strength

MAN
Give us strength now

A Roman soldier slams the Man against the wall then shoves
the crowd back as the Zealot passes The crowd cools down a
little

Now the villagers heap abuse on Jesus MARY 56 mother of
Jesus pushes her way through the crowd A MAN is about to
throw a stone at Jesus She grabs his arm tries to pry the
stone from his fingers

MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
Dont touch him Get away from him

She starts pushing people away in angry desperation

WOMAN IN CROWD
You defend him

MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
Yes Hes my son He doesnt know
what hes doing

The crowd now starts pushing Mary She resists A Centurion
breaks up the melee Jesus continues on his way

The Zealot has reached the crucifixion site a rocky flint
covered mound The soldiers wait for the cross

Children throw pebbles at Jesus as he approaches the Zealot
The Roman guards brace themselves for violence

Jesus sets the cross down beside the Zealot who is held by
guards

Mary comes through the crowd takes her son by the arm

MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
Alright Come away now

Jesus pulls away from her She goes after him but a guard
yanks her back into the crowd The Centurion gathers some
pieces of parchment together as the Zealots voice rings
out

ZEALOT
Listen Dont be afraid God is
strong Rome is smoke God will blow
it away Remember the Maccabees
remember how they threw out the
Greeks Well throw out the Romans
the same way Theres only one God
of Hosts and hes our God

CENTURION
(hes heard it all
before)

Finished

Without waiting for an answer the Centurion begins to read
the charges against the Zealot

CENTURION
This man naked before you now is
condemned for sedition for lifting
his hand against Rome Even as a boy
he pulled the Imperial Eagle from
walls He ran to the mountains and
rallied the people to Revolution He
promised a Messiah would come from
among the people to rise up and
destroy Rome

He starts paging through the parchment his interest
wandering

CENTURION
murder betrayal so on
‘looting and so on ‘and

therefore he is condemned to die
Rome condemns him All the Gods of
Rome condemn him And I condemn
him Start

The Zealot has been stripped naked and laid down on the cross-
bar The guards prepare to drive the nails into his wrists
A hush comes over the crowd

The spike is placed in the Zealots wrist The hammer drives
it home The Zealots scream (almost ecstatic) is echoed by
the crowd

Blood spurts from his wounds a drop splatters on Jesus
lips

JESUS
Because he loves me And I dont

streets are crowded with camels donkeys Mongols on
horseback Afghans laden with rugs and blankets Nubian slaves
following their Greek and Roman masters A Berber woman

He pushes his way through the crowd until he reaches the
home of Mary Magdalene On her door there is a painting of
two intertwined snakes one black one white and above the

stretched out as if crucified A row of camels horses and

Besides the young Indian nobleman (with three gold bands
around his ankles) there are three Bedounin three old men
with painted eyelashes and nails two young men with black
beards and moustaches and two rich black merchants An old
lady is off to one side crouched on the ground with a small
cage containing some crabs A small fire is beside her on
which she is cooking food There is no door to Magdalenes
room where she does business only a wispy half torn curtain
floating in the infrequent breeze This affords her waiting
clients a half-darkened view of the proceedings An Arab
makes love to her She is nude and good at her work

The young Indian nobleman lowers his eyelids begins swaying
his upper body back and forth and moves his lips as if in
prayer Jesus and the others glance at him One of the black
merchants pushes him with his knee and smiles
BLACK MERCHANT
Prince of India what does your God
have to say about all this

INDIAN NOBLEMAN
(opening his eyes)

INDIAN NOBLEMAN
That everything is a dream

One of the old men using prayer beads turns to them

her breasts

MAGDALENE

pitiful I hate you Heres my body

Jesus angry lunges for her and hits her hand away very
hard She pulls back on the couch and they stare at each
other When Magdalene speaks again she is calmer but even
sadder

man You never had the courage to be
one If you werent hanging onto

tree together I watched you Later
I wanted you to come to me but not
before you suffered

Magdalene is coming on to him He is her lifetime love No

it is with some tenderness

JESUS

Jeroboam shouts a prayer over the howling wind but we cannot
hear it

God and nothing else Thats all he
wants from me Im sure of it

JEROBOAM
Shame is also a temptation

JESUS
God hunts me He drives his nails
into my heart He wants to push me
over

Jesus hand sweeps out We follow He is gesturing toward
the steep precipice only a few yards away

JESUS
He wants me to speak But he didnt
touch my lips with burning coals
How can I speak I sinned

Not my sins What does He want from
me Cant he see whats inside me

JESUS
No Im a liar A hypocrite Im
afraid of everything I never tell

When I see a woman I blush and look
away But inside I have lust For
God I smother the lust and that
satisfies my pride But my pride
destroys Magdalene I never steal or
fight or kill not because I dont
want to but because Im afraid I
want to rebel against everything

The crowd in a festive mood hurl insults and spit at her

JUDAS
Its Magdalene She deserves it

Jesus steps into the center of the pit as the crowd starts
to throw stones One of them hits Jesus on the chest He
looks over at the man who threw the stone We have never
seen Jesus like this before neither has anyone in the crowd

Two little KIDS take one look giggle nervously and run
away Judas is riveted On the other side of the small crowd
PHILIP PETER ANDREW and JOHN watch this unexpected
confrontation with fascination

MAN IN CROWD
Get out of here This isnt your
business You want to get hurt

More stones are thrown Jesus doesnt move Magdalene has
grabbed his leg for reassurance

ZEBADEE pushes his way through the crowd

ZEBEDEE
You heard what he said idiot Move

JESUS
No I dont want this

ZEBEDEE
Oh listen to this He doesnt want
this Well we want it

JESUS
Why

ZEBEDEE
(livid)
We dont have to tell you why

Peter in the crowd interrupts angrily

PETER
Bad enough we live in a whorehouse
But does it have to be a Roman
whorehouse Our women cant even
look in a mirror on the Sabbath and
this one goes with Romans on the
Sabbath She broke Moses law So
she dies
Jesus picks up two stones from the ground

JESUS
Whos never sinned Which one of you
has never sinned Whichever one of
yous never sinned should come up
here and throw these

Zebedee steps forward immediately carrying his own small
stone

ZEBEDEE
Ive got nothing to hide

JESUS
Good Take one of these Theyre
bigger Youre not going to do much
damage with the small one

Zebedee hesitates

JESUS
Be careful Zebedee There is a God
Hes seen you cheat your workers
Hes seen you with that widow whats
her name

WOMAN IN THE CROWD
Judith

JESUS
dudith Arent you afraid God
will paralyze you if your lift that
stone That your hand will wither
and hang at your side

Zebedee drops the rock and moves back Several MEN start
toward Jesus but Judas steps between them braced for action
They stop

Jesus helps Mary to her feet Judas calls to the crowd
JUDAS
Follow us follow the Rabbi He wants

to talk to you

Judas Jesus and Magdalene walk away from the pit A large
segment of the crowd follows
WOMAN IN CROWD
Who is he

MAN
Its Jesus From Nazareth

SECOND MAN
Nothing good can come out of Nazareth
Even the scriptures say it

They start back away from the crowd toward the town
CUT TO
EXT HILLSIDE IN MAGDALA - DAY

The nearby summit of the hill which was the site of some
ancient pagan temple probably Mesopotamian Fragments of
several carved capitals of columns lay on the ground along
with pieces of pagan Gods (winged lions with womens heads
etc)

Magdalene sits near Jesus feet Judas stands in the
background The crowd waits to hear what Jesus has to say
Jesus looks out over the poverty-stricken villagers the
peaceful country-side

JESUS (VO)
This is what Ive always been afraid
of Theres so much to say God has
so many miracles

A pause The words start to come

JESUS
Come closer everybody My brothers
My sisters Im calling you that
because were all a family A little
closer My voice isnt very strong
and Ive got something to tell you

The crowd gets closer still more curious than anything else

JESUS
Im sorry if I have to tell you
stories But is seems to be the only
way I can tell you what I have to
(pause)
A farmer was planting in his field
Some seed fell on the ground and the
birds ate it Some seed fell on rocks
and dried up But some seed fell on
rich soil grew into wheat and fed a
lot of people

Long silence No one has any idea what the hell hes talking
about

JESUS
Didnt you hear me Are you people
deaf

ZEBEDEE

(indignant)
We can hear fine Its not us Cant
you be more clear

Jesus thinks for a moment He is also hiding annoyance

JESUS
Im the farmer The farmers me

ZEBEDEE
Wait a minute I get it Dont tell
me We must be the stones Were the
ground is that it Thats just fine
And two and two makes four

(to crowd )
Another lunatic

JOHN Zebedees youngest son who has an air of perpetual
abstraction leaves his father and approaches Jesus

JOHN
Rabbi tell me If youre the farmer
and were the stones what is the
seed

Jesus is baffled

JOHN
Whats the seed

JESUS
(surprised)

Love one another Love one another

This is too much for the crowd to take
ANDREW
Alright lets say we accept that
Maybe thats even good advice But
for some other world Not here were
starving Feed us first then talk

While the crowd makes noise Judas steps near to Jesus and
talks to him so the others cant hear

JUDAS
What are you talking about love
This is your message We should all
love the Romans Thats like putting
our neck on the knife

Jesus takes a step forward going with the momentum of his
strong feelings

JESUS
Listen I used to think God was angry
too But not any more He used to
jump on me like a wild bird and dig
his claws into my head But then one
morning he came to me He blew over
me like a cool breeze and said Stand
up And here I am

ZEBEDEE
Go to hell

MAN IN CROWD
These are all stories for children
They cant help us

Jesus starts into the crowd confronting them directly

JESUS
What are you hungry for And you
youre thirsty What are you thirsty
for For justice Justice

ANDREW
And bread

JESUS
Bread too bread too Im telling
you whoevers hungry for justice
whoevers thirsty for justice
theyre the ones wholl be blessed
Theyll be filled with bread Theyll
never be thirsty again

Jesus works his way through the crowd really winning them
over He points at somebody else

JESUS
And you Youre in mourning But
mourners will be blessed Youll
have Gods comfort you wont need
it from men

Now he addresses the crowd at large

JESUS
And the meek theyre the ones
wholl be blessed And the
suffering theyll be blessed too
and the merciful and the peacemakers
And the poor and the sick and the
outcasts you will all be blessed
Because Heaven is yours

Now the crowd is really with him

JESUS
But believe me The ones who are
laughing now

He indicates a couple of skeptics in the crowd

JESUS
-will be crying later The ones
who are fed now will be hungry soon
And the rich will be poor forever

The crowd agitated and excited starts to run off

FIRST VOICE
Lets kill the rich

SECOND VOICE
Why bother with the rich Kill the
Romans

JESUS
(protests)
I didnt say death I said love I
said love

ZEBEDEE
(motions to his son)
Lets go

JOHN
No Go on without me

JAMES looks as if he wants to stay too but Zebedee pulls
him by the arm and stalks off John and Andrew stay behind
with Peter Philip and Judas

Mary Magdalene stands next to Jesus now

MAGDALENE

No Stay here Tell people about me

He kneels and wipes her bloody feet with his tunic

dogs bring up the rear They approach Zebedee who works
with James Nathaniel and two other fishermen

ZEBEDEE

(to John)

John steps over to his brother James and starts pulling him
away

JOHN

Zebedee grabs James other arm
ZEBEDEE

He swats both John and James on the ear The other disciples

JUDAS

(Laughing)
Watch it Zebedee youll lose another

JESUS

Zebedee do you really need them
You can hire other men They wont
be your sons so youll have to pay
them

ZEBEDEE
Pay them I cant afford to pay them
I cant afford to pay anybody Look
my nets have been empty for weeks

JESUS
Look at them now

The nets are teeming with fish

ZEBEDEE
Howd you do that

JESUS
Maybe the current changed

CUT TO
EXT GALILEE - NIGHT

The disciples sleep in an olive grove Jesus awake sits on
a nearby knoll looking into the night
Judas walks over and sits next to him

JUDAS
Rabbi can I talk to you

He sits next to him

JUDAS

Im not like these other men I mean
theyre good enough But theyre
weak How are they going to fight
for you They couldnt even fight
for themselves Whered you find
them Ones worse than the other
This is no army

JESUS
I dont need soldiers

JUDAS
You wanted me And if I love somebody
Id die for them If I hate somebody
Ill kill them I can even kill
somebody I love if he does the wrong
thing Do you understand

JESUS
I understand

JUDAS
The other day when you said turn the
other cheek to the man that hit you
I didnt like that Only an angel
could do that only an angel ora
dog Im a free man I dont turn my
cheek to anyone You do need soldiers

JESUS
Will soldiers make me free

JUDAS
You want freedom for Israel

JESUS
I want freedom for the soul

JUDAS
First you free the body then the
soul You know that The Romans come
first

JESUS
The soul is first If you dont change
what the soul needs youll only
replace Roman domination with another
domination and nothingll ever change
First you have to change man inside
Then man can change whats around
him Its wanting wealth and power
that makes the soul want to dominate
others Thats the wanting we have
to change we have to free the soul
first With love

JUDAS
We all want that eventually But
right now the only way is to start
from the bottom You build a house
from the foundation up

(he turns)
Whos there

Andrew sleepy-eyed walks over concerned

ANDREW
Its me Andrew Is everything

JESUS

(interrupting)
Go back to sleep Judas and I are
talking

Andrew turns and leaves Judas waits then speaks

JUDAS
I still dont know who you are

JESUS
Neither do I

JUDAS
You cant look to the others for
answers All they can do is follow
you Its between you and me When I
went to kill you in the monastery
God took my strength away Thats
what made me think even if I didnt
want to thats what made me think
you might be the one The Messiah
Maybe you are maybe you arent
maybe you dont even know yourself
if you are Thats why I said to
myself be patient for once in your
life See what he does see what he
says and if hes not the Messiah
theres plenty of time to kill him

JESUS
How can I be the Messiah First of
all I wanted to kill those people
when I saw them torturing Magdalene
Then when I opened my mouth out
came the word love Why How can
we tell

JUDAS
Alright You say God talks through
you and right now I believe you
Theres another one he talks through

JESUS
The Baptist

JUDAS
Well go to see him He stands out
there every day preaching He is
coming he is coming As soon as he
sees you hell know who you are

Behold I will raise up evil against

eyes and give them to your neighbor
and he shall lie with your wives in
the sight of this sun

been or are about to be Baptized are naked

CUT TO

EXTINT BAPTISTS CAVE - DAY

Jesus and Judas approach They enter a small cave like an
antechamber in which the light has a slight greenish tint

In the larger cave the BAPTIST is preaching Jesus gasps
when he first sees him a wild man unkempt unwashed (hair
like a Rastafarian) He shouts in the wind

THE BAPTIST
Roll on the ground bite the dust
howl The Lord of Hosts says On
this day I will command the sun to
set at noon I will crush the horns
of the new moon and spill darkness
over the earth I will reverse your
laughter turn it into tears and
your songs I will turn into
lamentations I will blow and all

your finery -- hands feet noses
ears hairs -- will fall to the
ground

Hes awesome Even Judas is taken back He grabs Jesus

JUDAS
God He sounds like the Messiah

JESUS
No the Messiah wont have an ax in
his hand

Judas pushes Jesus forward

JUDAS
Well see Go in front Let him see
you

Jesus walks slowly toward the Baptist his eyes fixed on the
prophet The crowd flails and shouts one half-naked woman
slashes herself with sharp stones (throws herself on the
ground etc)
JESUS (VO)
Even from behind I knew I had seen
him before Where When Was it a
dream Yes it was But in the dream
he was all dressed in white

Jesus steps behind the Baptist John suddenly turns at him

THE BAPTIST
Who are you

JESUS
(his voice anxious)
Do you recognize me

JESUS
Have you read Isaiah Do you know
the prophets What does Isaiah say

THE BAPTIST
He says Prepare the way of the
Lord Are you telling me thats

Tell me

The Baptist looks around the crowd wails in SILENT MOTION
A sudden calmness We see them from Judas POV Judas
strains to hear but cant The Baptist knows Jesus

THE BAPTIST
Why are you here

JESUS
To be baptized

THE BAPTIST
I dont dare If you are the Master
you should baptize me

JESUS
Baptize me
Jesus kneels at Johns feet throws off his robe (his
nakedness partially hidden by people in the foreground)
Judas looks on

CUT TO
EXT RIVER OF JORDAN - NIGHT

Jesus and the Baptist sit in the cave by a fire built near
the baptismal pool An eerie blue-green light falls on the
walls of the cave their faces are reflected in the pool
water A group of pilgrims camp in the back of the cave
Music is heard

Jesus and the Baptist are weary from hours of debate

JESUS
Isnt love enough

THE BAPTIST
No The tree is rotten You have to
take the ax and cut it down

JESUS
If I was a woodcutter Id cut If I
was fire Id burn But Im a heart
and I love

THE BAPTIST
Im a heart also but I cant love
whats unjust I cant love evil
What I cant love I attack God
demands it God demands anger

JESUS
Anger Arent we all brothers

THE BAPTIST

You think love is Gods only way Go
to the Dead Sea Look in the bottom
youll see the two whores Sodom and
Gomorrah God was angry He threw
fire at them turned over the dry
land and the sea swallowed them up
Thats Gods way On the day of the
Lord blood will flow from wood the
stones of the houses will come alive
and kill their owners That day is
here He gave me the ax now I give
it to you

Jesus frightened turns away

JESUS
Thats not the answer

THE BAPTIST
(aggravated)
No Then what is the answer

JESUS
I dont know I think its love

THE BAPTIST
Well I know And if you wont listen
to me who will you listen to To
God The God of Israels a god of
the desert If you want to speak to
him then you go to the desert

sweet voices and death

The Baptist walks over to Jesus

JESUS

landscape shimmers with heat under a huge white sun (SPECIAL
EFFECT) The image is tinted warm red

Jesus wanders through the wild uninhabited terrain The
sun like a blast furnace blows sand into his face

He starts to draw a large circle

JESUS (VO)

No hums No thunder No headaches
Just talk to me in human words
Whatever path you want Ill take
Love or the ax or anything else Or
if you want me to stay here and die
Ill do that too But you have to
tell me

He sits in the center of the circle

He sees the sun looming huge in the sky seeming to be
unnaturally close to him (SPECIAL EFFECT)

He sees in the far distance birds flying across a great
plain

He sees on the flat desert the plain of Sodom a herd of
gazelles

He continues to watch as we

FADE OUT
EXT DESERT - NIGHT
FADE IN Days have past The hunger and deprivation are
beginning to show on Jesus face His clothes are the color

of soil

JESUS
I dont want I dont want to be
alone

He puts his head down but hears sounds and looks into the
moonlit night SOUNDS of water bracelets laughing Then a
large SERPENT coils at the edge of the circle speaking ina
half-human half-animal voice

SERPENT
I felt sorry for you You were lonely
You cried so I came

JESUS
I didnt call you Who are you

SERPENT
Your soul

JESUS
My soul

SERPENT
Youre afraid of being alone Just
like Adam He called me and I reached
into his ribs and gave him a wife

JESUS
Youre here to trick me

SERPENT
Trick you To love and care for a
woman To have a family -- this is a

trick Why are you trying to save

the world Arent your own sins enough
for you What arrogance to think

its your duty to save the world

The world doesnt have to be saved
Find love

JESUS
I have love

SERPENT
Look into my eyes look at my
breasts

The Serpents voice dissolves into the soft comforting voice
of Mary Magdalene
SERPENT
DO you recognize them Say the
word Nod your head and well be in
my bed together

Jesus looks up eyes glaring

SERPENT
(compassionately)
Oh Jesus

The Serpent suddenly explodes leaving no trace Jesus places
his head between his legs and begins to sob as if he has
lost a loved one

CUT TO
EXT DESERT - NIGHT

FADE IN Another week has passed Jesus clothes are torn
and tattered by the desert winds He awakens

JESUS (VO)
After ten days the hunger went away

He hears a sound A LION stands at the edge of the circle

LION
Welcome Jesus Congratulations
Youve overcome the small temptations
of a woman a family Were both
bigger than that A womans not
enough we need the whole world

JESUS
Who are you

LION
Im you Im your heart Your heart
is so hungry It pretends to be humble
but it secretly wants to conquer the
world I will set my four feet down
one in Babylon one in Jerusalem
one in Alexandria the last in Rome

JESUS
Ive never wanted a kingdom on earth
The Kingdom of Heavens good enough
for me
The Lions voice transforms into Judas

LION
Youre a liar Youve always wanted
power When you were making crosses
for the Romans in Nazareth your
head was exploding with dreams of
power You said it was God but you
really wanted to rule others Now
you will Any country you want All
countries You will rule Babylon
You will rule Jerusalem You will
rule Alexandria You will even rule
Rome

Jesus shaking reaches out toward the Lion

JESUS

pull out your tongue

The Lion steps into the circle and as he does disappears

FADE OUT
EXT DESERT - NIGHT

FADE IN Jesus lies sleeping Another week has past Hes a
wasted skeleton

An ARCHANGEL stands at the circles edge The Angel appears
as a normal ten-year-old boy speaking in the voice of a young
girl Jesus strains to see through his swollen eyelids

JESUS
Archangel go farther back Youre
blinding me

ARCHANGEL
Im the one youve been waiting for
Remember when you were a child you
cried Make me a God God make me
a God

JESUS
But I was just a child then
ARCHANGEL
Adonai You are God The Baptist

salute you Son only Son of God
Join me in power We will rule
together over the living and the
dead Youll give life and take life
Youll sit on the throne and Ill
sit at your hand Imagine how strong
we could be together

Jesus suddenly realizes who hes talking to

JESUS
Satan

The ripe tree from Jesus dream appears behind the Archangel
The Angel offers an apple

Jesus bites into the apple it turns into blood in his mouth
The blood splashes down his chest

ANGEL
(smiling)
Well see each other again

The Archangel turns and leaves Jesus picks up a stick at
his feet The stick is an ax

We see from over Jesus shoulder John the Baptist crouches
down into the frame puts his hand on Jesus shoulder and
speaks

THE BAPTIST
Dont be afraid You are the One I
was the one who came before you My
work is finished Now I can die The
Lord wants me to tell you to stand
up his day is here Take the ax
Run and carry the message to men

Jesus rises and strikes at the root of the tree with an ax
Entire scene turns red

Jesus is standing at the edge of the pool He reaches into

his chest and rips out his own heart

He offers it at arms

length to the disciples Blood drips from the ventricles

JESUS

This is my heart Take it I lead

the way to the Kingdom of God

walks at Jesus right Peter at his left Women and children
follow them

They come upon pits dug into the ground The soil is colored
a strong green Suddenly bare arms come up out of some of
the pits Heads pop up from others Then seven deranged men
and women their naked bodies colored green from the soil
crawl out of the pits and run toward Jesus They flail at
him some fall at his feet Some beg in jibberish

Judas and Peter try to ward them off Jesus is angry -- not
at the men but at the evil spirits that possess them

He slaps one man kicks another he grabs one by the head
and pushes on him causing him to fall

JESUS
Satan Leave them Get out

Judas and Peter hold Jesus as he touches each of the insane
people They are in the thick of what looks like a brawl At
one point Jesus almost faints but is carried forward by the
two apostles Jesus shouts as he touches the possessed After
they have been confronted by Jesus they grow suddenly calm
Some are confused some praise Jesus Jesus is held by the
apostles partially for protection and partially for strength

EXT NAZARETH — DAY

Sabbath The faithful fresh from synagogue mill about under
the date palms in the manner of churchmen over the centuries

These are not common people On the contrary they represent
the Jewish hierarchy the severely moral Pharisess Saducees
in collusion with the Romans and the landowners and
shopkeepers who supported the synagogue

Jesus calls out

Judas and Peter elicit the help of two others and lean their

The stone moves a hideous stench gusts from the tomb Some
disciples turn their faces others put handkerchiefs to their
noses

Jesus stands at the entrance of the tomb and yells His voice
echoes a wild strange cry like something from another
world

JESUS
Lazarus In the name of the prophets
in the name of Jeremiah and my Father
in the name of most Holy God I demand
that you rise and come out

At first nothing Then we begin to hear a soft rustling
inside the tomb Jesus is apprehensive He stares at the
tombs entrance Suddenly a decomposed skeletal human hand
reaches out The crowd gasps Jesus startled jumps Slowly
Jesus reaches out moves a bit closer and clasps the corpses
hand He is terrified Suddenly the corpse pulls back as if
to yank Jesus into the tomb Jesus is more frightened He
stands his ground Then Jesus decides to pull and the corpse
comes out The disciples and the crowd are stunned The
desicated figure Lazarus is covered head to toe in white
burial cloth His free hand slowly unwraps the cloth from

his face Strips of rotting flesh hang loose Lazarus embraces
Jesus

EXT TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM - EARLY MORNING SUNRISE

Jesus and his companions are walking along the ruins
(Excavations in Jerusalem) The city wall is behind them

Then from above (St Stevens Gate) they enter the Roman
ruins An arch towers above them a pool below them some
inhabitants of the ruins watch

They enter the temple plaza

Jesus enters the temple grounds with his central core of
disciples They have come to worship

But they are stopped cold by the sight that greets them
Arranged all around the stairs that lead to the temple are
money-changers merchants beggars and whores A tall shiny
bronze statue of Tiberius towers over the plaza floor which
is stained with the blood of sacrificial animals Jesus turns
to Peter

JESUS
We came here to pray What is this

PETER
The money-changers Its for the
temple tax for the feast

Jesus calmly addresses a money-changer

JESUS
Hows the exchange today Making a
good profit

MONE Y-CHANGER
Fair Can I help you

Jesus stares for a moment and then with one violent blow
sends the counter filled with coins sailing into the money-
changers face

Jesus now enraged strides past the booths overturning the
tables Scales weights and coins from all over the world
scatter in every direction The vendors rush to retrieve
their money
Other vendors and customers turn on Jesus Judas Peter and
the others forcibly fight them off Jesus calls out

JESUS
This is my Fathers house Its a
place for worship not a bank ora
market

The disciples circle Jesus for his protection The RABBI
surrounded by SADDUCESS steps out of the temple

RABBI
Nazarene what are you doing

JESUS
God doesnt need a grand house He
doesnt need cyprus and bloody
animals He doesnt need shekels

RABBI
You expect people to pay the tax in
Roman coins They have images of
false gods on them You want pagan
gods in the temple All foreign coins
have to be changed to shekels That
the law

JESUS
I abolish the law I give a new law
and a new hope

RABBI
What did God change his mind about
the old law

JESUS

(exasperated)
No no He just thinks our hearts
are ready now to hold more

RABBI

(not listening)
This chaos is your new law How can
you presume

JESUS
How can I presume Because I am the
fulfillment of the old law and the
beginning of the new
SADDUCEE
(shocked)

Watch what youre saying

Peter becoming concerned with the drift of this argument
whispers to Jesus

PETER
Maybe we should go

Jesus pushes him away

JESUS
When I say I Rabbi I am saying
God

RABBI

Thats blasphemy

JESUS
Didnt you hear Im the Saint of
Blasphemy Dont make any mistakes
I havent come to bring peace Ive
come to bring a sword

SADDUCEE
Talking like that will get you killed

JESUS
Im sick of all of you This temple
will be destroyed in three days One
stone wont be left standing on
another You think God belongs only
to you He doesnt Gods an immortal
spirit and belongs to everybody --
to the whole world Youre not
special God is not an Israelite

Even the disciples are shocked by this heresy They escort
Jesus out of the temple grounds for his own safety

As they reach the bottom of the temple steps they are mobbed
The beggars press on Jesus pulling at his arms and legs

MOB MEMBER 1
Magician Heal me
MOB MEMBER 2
Cure us Make us rich

MOB MEMBER 3
Heal me Do a miracle You want me
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven
crippled like this

JESUS

(pushes them away)
Get away You sicken me Youre
selfish Youre full of hate God
wont help you

MOB MEMBER 1
Cure us or you wont leave this city
alive

JESUS
You dont demand from God

The disciples intervene and pull Jesus away The mob follows
Suddenly four Roman Calvary men stampede into the mob
whipping beggars and everyone else Jesus and the disciples
break loose from the fray

ROMAN OFFICER
You all of you stop Which one of
you is Jesus of Nazareth

The disciples groan

JESUS
I am

ROMAN OFFICER
Come with us The Procurator wants
to see you

The calvarymen lead Jesus away leaving the disciples behind

As they watch him go SAUL a Zealot comes up behind Judas
and draws him aside

SAUL
We need you What are you doing with
this magician First you were supposed
to kill him Now he acts like a
prophet and you follow him
JUDAS
What are you saying Didnt you just
hear him

SAUL
I heard him He talks about a new
law he talks about using a sword
But we took an oath to use the sword
against Rome I dont see anything
against Rome here All I see here is
Jew against Jew

Judas walks away from him

The Roman soldiers escort Jesus into the open theatre

Pilate confers with two soldiers at a table near the stage

He

watches a play in rehearsal (See Director Production

Designer and Costumer for details of play)

Pilate is informed of Jesus presence and turns to him

PILATE

PILATE
Good Keep it there They tell me

or bad magic Can you do a trick for
us

JESUS

to see something

JESUS
The prophet Daniel had a vision A
huge statue had a gold head and
silver shoulders

PILATE

(interrupts)
Dont tell me stories Im not a
dumb Jew

JESUS

Listen Learn

PILATE
(daring him)
Go ahead Teach me something

JESUS
The stomach was bronze the legs
were iron the feet were clay A
stone was thrown The clay feet broke
and the statue collapsed

PILATE

JESUS
God is the thrower Im the stone
Rome is the statue

PILATE
Clearly But thats how youre going
to bring down the Roman Empire One
stone Only you

Jesus starts to speak then stops
JESUS (VO)
God give me the answer I dont
know what to say

PILATE
No answer

JESUS (VO)
Please speak to me I need words

A pain suddenly surges through the back of Jesus neck His
knees buckle For a moment he seems crippled

PILATE
Youre not a stone Youre excrement
Get him out of here

Jesus is confused humiliated and in pain Soldiers start
to lead him out

PILATE

should see you now

Pilate turns back to the play

your power Zealots say youre paid
by the Romans to tell the people

Yes It make everything clearer

JUDAS

Zealots want a revolution but now

JUDAS

depend on me

JESUS
You know why I came to Jerusalem

JUDAS
This is where were going to fight
This is where the revolutions going
to happen

Jesus nods

JESUS
Last night Isaiah came to me

JUDAS
(eager)
What did he say

JESUS
He opened his book and I read in
giant letters He has borne our
faults he was wounded for our
transgressions He was afflicted
yet he opened not his mouth Despised
and rejected by all he went forward
without resisting like a lamb led

to the slaughter

JUDAS

(pause)
So What does that have to do with
you

JESUS

Judas Im the lamb Im the one who
is going to die

JUDAS
What do you mean die Die Did you
change your mind again

JESUS
No

Judas jumps up

JUDAS
Then what are you talking about
That cant be If youre the Messiah
why do you have to die

JESUS
Dont shout Youll understand soon
At first I didnt understand myself

JUDAS
Every day you have a different plan
I cant believe it First its love
then its the ax now you have to
die What good could that do We
need you alive

JESUS
I cant help it God only talks to
me a little at a time He only shows
me as much as I have to know Now I
finally understand All my life All
my life Ive been followed By
footsteps By voices By headaches
By shadows And you know what the
shadow is Its the cross I have to
die on the cross And I have to die
willingly We need courage Judas
We need faith Im the fulfillment
of the prophecy The cross is the
way I have to take

Judas is dumbfounded and his anger is mounting

JESUS
So we go to Jerusalem We go back to
the temple Whatever happens there
will put me on the cross

JUDAS

(barely controlling

his anger)
And after you die on the cross What
happens then

JESUS
Ill come back to judge the living
and the dead

through The excavations around Jerusalem The city wall is
behind them More people begin to join the ranks

They enter St Stephens Gate (the arch over a pool of
water) The mob grows around them Some have palm branches

They are now in the Underground City Jesus is riding a
donkey Women and children wave palm branches throw flowers
lay down palms and shawls in Jesus path They cheer Rosanna
Rosanna

A new chant -- abetted by Judas and his followers -- goes
up Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews

The procession reaches the temple plaza Jesus dismounts and
looks around

Outside the temple walls stalls occupy every nook and cranny
Hundreds of people are selling buying bargaining hawking
their wares merchants money-changers innkeepers
prostitutes

Jesus full of rage followed by the disciples sweeps down
on the wine stands and workshops overturning the tables
striking the tradesmen with his goad (determined crane -
MS)

JESUS
Get out Away

Jesus mounts the temple steps Smoke seems to be coming from
his body This is his moment

Behind him everyone loots stalls and routs merchants with
great enthusiasm as if Jesus solitary act of anger last
time in the temple had now become an example for mob action
On the top of the temple steps Jesus pauses momentarily
JESUS (VO)

Lord I hope this is what you want

Please let it happen quickly while

I have the strength

Now he turns to face the mob

JESUS
I am here to set fire to the world
In the desert The Baptist said
Repent Repent The day of the Lord
is coming but Im saying its too
late to repent The Day of the Lords
already here I am the Day of the
Lord I come with the baptism of
fire

The poor in the mob yell Fire Fire -- burn it all down

The TEMPLE GUARDS (usually Levites) grab their lances and
swords Judas cohorts draw their weapons

Suddenly there is a blast of trumpets ROMAN SENTRIES
heavily armed appear on top of the temple walls There are
dozens of them and they are ready to fight

The people look up Jesus stops Peter is still rallying the
crowd lighted torch in his hand

PETER
Lets go Nows the time

The crowd looks from the Romans to Jesus For the moment
the crowd is still with him Judas whispers urgently to Jesus

JUDAS
Theyre all with you Theyre waiting
for your signal Give it

Peter looks over at Jesus

PETER
Come on Now

Jesus looks from the Romans on the wall to the ground

JESUS (VO)
Please Im waiting too Put the ax
in my hands Not the cross Let me
die like this

JOHN
If you dont give the sign now were
finished Well be killed for what
we did today

PHILIP
We came here to fight not to die
Jesus remains still

JUDAS
Master we knew they would be strong
We knew it would be like this

The Roman Soldiers swarm off the walls and start down into
the temple

Jesus looks at his hands blood oozes from his palms He
closes his fists to hide the stigmata and raises his eyes to
Judas

JESUS
Judas Come beside me

Judas puts his arm around Jesus The crowd confused and
furious starts to scatter Some of them throw things at the
disciples as they all scramble to avoid the violence of the
Roman soldiers

JESUS
(to Judas)
Stay by my side

The other disciples swarm around Jesus and Judas and form a
wedge As the Roman soldiers disperse through the temple
courtyard Jesus and the disciples are swept by the frantic
crowd into a side street leading to the Underground City
below the temple

Passover preparations are underway At twilight we see the
excavations in Jerusalem Over a hundred people in black
move across them Large candles cover the entire site

We see now elderly Jews cleansing themselves at the ritual
baths The steam rises to the sky

The Underground City is teeming with men women children
(animals) preparing for the celebration They wear black and
white shawls and are bathed in candlelight Psalms music
and voices are heard
Jesus and Judas are walking and watching carefully
stop at a selected spot between two trees

JUDAS
Theres got to be something else you
can do

JESUS
I wish there was At the temple I
prayed I prayed to die But its
not Gods will I have to die on the
cross I prayed out of weakness and
Im weakening even more Youve got
to give me strength

JUDAS
I wont let you die

JESUS
Youve got to Theres no other way
The world around us is Satans world
It will be destroyed The world of
God will come But only by my dying
By my sacrifice on the cross Forget
everything else Understand that

JUDAS
No I cant Im not strong enough

JESUS
You are Youre the strongest Youre
part of Gods plan too You once
made me a promise You said if I
ever strayed if I ever shied away

job to be crucified

Three seven-branched candelabra illuminate the lamb wine
and unleavened bread

The disciples are seated on cushions on the ground Food is
brought in from an adjacent room

Mary Martha and Magdalene have all come to Jerusalem to
celebrate the festival with Jesus and his disciples and
prepare the ritual meal

Jesus fills the disciples cups from a pitcher of salt water

JESUS
Our ancestors in Egypt celebrated
Passover before they escaped to the
freedom of the desert On this
Passover we come out of another kind
of slavery and enter another kind of
freedom

PHILIP
Oh please Were hiding here like
criminals we cant go out the door
and even if we could we wouldnt
want to because weve been so
humiliated wed like to respect
you

JOHN
Respect him We love him

PHILIP
yes alright yes we love him
that goes without saying but at
least he could

JESUS
(interrupting)
First first first we drink

salt water to remember the tears and
pain our ancestors suffered in the
land of Israel

Jesus swallows his drink in a single gulp Judas is the first
to do likewise Mary brings a tray of bitter herbs As the
disciples eat Jesus watches

JESUS
Tonight we go further This passover
celebrates the passage from death to
eternal life Ill lead the way you
will follow John you know the
prophets Isaiah says He had neither
beauty nor luster that we should
turn our eyes to him He was despised
and rejected by men

JOHN

(continues)
But he took on himself all our
pains He was wounded for our
transgressions he was bruised for
our inequities and with his stripes
we are healed

JESUS

(interrupting)
He was scourged and he was
afflicted Yet like a lamb led to
the slaughter he opened not his
mouth

(a beat)
My dear wonderful friends I am the
lamb And I wont open my mouth
Theyve been leading me to the
slaughter ever since I was born

The disciples exchange fearful glances

PETER
If you die Ill die first Because
Ill be at your side

JESUS
Be quiet What did you have before I
found you All of you Nothing

(no answer)
Now you have Gods love -- and eternal
life Dont worry You wont die
yet Theres still a lot of work to
do We havent come to rule but to
serve In three days Ill rise from
the dead to lead you

The disciples stare in shocked silence Jesus has either
gone completely mad -- or he is the Messiah

Jesus breaks the bread loaves and passes them around He
pours wine for the others

JESUS
Eat this is my body Drink this is
my blood I will be in you always

As they do the bread and the wine transubstantiate into
flesh and blood in their mouths They blanch and cough some
blood falls on the table Peter removes the substance from
his mouth with his hand and examines it it has the
consistency of blood and flesh This is literally hard for
all the disciples to swallow But they all persevere and
finally they all manage to do it As they wipe their bloody

mouths John starts to weep Jesus turns and looks at Judas

Judas exits Peter shouts angrily after him
PETER
Judas where are you going
(to Jesus)

Wheres he going

JESUS
Dont get in the way Tonight well
go to Gethsemane to pray

CUT TO
EXT GETHSEMANE - NIGHT

As they climb the steep hills of Gethsemane Jesus leaves
most of his group behind and proceeds with Peter James and
John Passing through thick gnarled olive groves they reach
a clearing marked by three boulders (looks like a Henry
Moore sculpture) The leaves glisten on the trees all around
them

JESUS
Wait for me here

Jesus walks alone until he finds a secluded spot Pulling
his tunic around him he kneels beneath an ancient tree

JESUS
Father Father in heaven Father on
earth The world you created that we
can see is beautiful But the world
you created that we cant see is
beautiful too I dont know -- forgive
me -- Father I dont know which is
the more beautiful

Jesus scoops up a handful of soil and smells it What
perfume he thinks Then as he rubs the soil on his cheeks
neck and lips he speaks

JESUS
This is my body too Together we
will die

Jesus body weakens He starts to sweat
JESUS
Abba Father weve been together a
long time I never asked to be chosen
but I always obeyed Youve done
many miracles for others You opened
the Red Sea for Moses You saved
Noah You took Elijah directly to
heaven in a fiery chariot Now you
ask me to be crucified Can I ask
you one last time Do I have to die
Is there any other way Do I have to
drink from this cup Cant you take
it away from me

Jesus waits for an answer that doesnt come The wind blows
through the olive trees

Jesus looks over sees Peter James and John asleep
Now in front of him a GUARDIAN ANGEL in the form of one of
the sleeping disciples appears and sets a clay cup before

Jesus

JESUS
Is this your answer

The Angel drinks from the cup then hands it to Jesus
Jesus reaches for the cup but the Angel no longer holds it
His hand is empty Then slowly the Angels hand reaches
forward and lightly caresses the top of Jesus head to comfort
him
JESUS

Your will be done I only ask for

strength
Jesus wipes the sweat and tears from his face and leaves

just an hour

Peter is the first to awake

PETER

Jesus hears the sound of soldiers in the distance

JESUS
It doesnt matter Its too late

Jesus hears the evening nightingale overheard A feeling of
peace sweeps over him He smiles at James and John as they
awaken (moving camera here to end of scene)

Judas and a band of Romans and armed Temple Guards carrying
long torches burst into the clearing Peter pulls his dagger
Jesus pushes him back Judas greets his master

JUDAS
Welcome Rabbi

Judas kisses him fiercely on the mouth Jesus gratefully
embraces his faithful disciple Tears stream down Judas
cheek

Peter attacks and slices off one of the Temple Guards ears

Jesus pushes Judas unwillingly away He turns to Peter
touches the knife simply (36 fps)

JESUS
No You live by this you die by it

The knife falls to the ground (36 fps) Two guards grab
Peter but he wrestles them off and runs away Jesus picks up
the severed ear (36 fps) and miraculously restores it to
the Levite (36 fps)

JESUS
Welcome Youre the messengers of
God Lets go
CUT TO

INT ANTONIA - DAY
Jesus again stands before Pilate He is bloody beaten
exhausted from lack of sleep A clique of Temple Guards
Pharisees and Sadducess stand in one corner of the hall

PILATE
Youre back

(pause)
Hello

(pause)

So now youre a king Is that right
Jesus stares at the sky

PILATE
Dont look in the air Look at me
Answer me I can crucify you You
know that Now are you a king

JESUS
Some say so

PILATE
Ah yes Well last time you took that
line with me you fooled me I dont
like to be fooled What you did in
the temple makes it very clear Youre
just another of these religious
revolutionaries making difficulties
You take the people into the desert
you talk about God love mercy and
the new kingdom but youre just the
same as the Zealots You all promise
glory and bring death Theres a new
Messiah every week and a new one
dies every week and Rome continues

JESUS
Remember the statue And the stone
And the clay feet

PILATE
How could I forget Still think your

kingdom will replace Rome

JESUS
No My kingdom is not on earth

PILATE
No it wouldnt be Youre a little
smarter than the others After all
whats a revolution on earth compared
to a revolution in peoples hearts

JESUS
Its a revolution that will come
with love not by the sword

PILATE
Either way its dangerous Its
against Rome Its against the way
the world is And either way I dont
care Sword or love its all the
same I dont care how you want to
change things We dont want them
changed So you know what has to
happen We have a small space for
you up on Golgotha Right next to
the bones of your predecessors Three
thousand skulls there very likely
more by now Maybe you people should
go out and count them sometime Maybe
then youd learn your lesson But
probably not

Pilate looks over at the Pharisees and Sadducees

PILATE
Do you gentlemen have anything to
add

SADDUCEE

We cant condone the killing of any
Jew But everything this man does
and everything he says could lead to
revolution We dont want revolution
Action against a power like Rome is
hopeless It invites reprisals that
would mean the extinction of the
Jewish people Its the death of one
man against the death of millions
Theres no alternative for us

PHARISEE
Many of our own people believe this
man is being paid by Rome anyway

PILATE
Fine Its agreed
(to Jesus)
But just so people appreciate your
rank well write it all out for
them King of the Jews

tied to it naked (obscured nudity) He is scourged

CUT TO

Weakened bloody naked (obscured nudity) Jesus is being
swung by the arm like a rag doll into a solid wall (pan)
Closer we see his face as it hits the wall smashing his
nose

Close of a crown of thorns (rather a skullcap of them)
being hit onto his head with the broad edge of a sword

CUT TO
EXT ANTONIA - LATER

In the distance Roman soldiers lead Jesus onto the balcony
overlooking the temple plaza and present him to the awaiting
mob His tunic is drenched with blood

The crowd watching this ceremony is literally divided against
itself Half is cheering and carousing a real lynch mob
The other half is angry and shouting to stop the crucifixion
Soldiers manage to contain these little pockets of action

PETER stands watching with his back pressed against a wall
A BEGGAR turns to him

BEGGAR
Ive seen you Youre one of his
followers
PETER
No It must be somebody else

BEGGAR
No its you

PETER
You dont know what youre talking
about
Peter turns quickly and disappears into the crowd

runs into Philip also fleeing

They dont even speak After a fleeting recognition they
sprint in opposite directions

CUT TO

EXT JERUSALEM (THE EXCAVATIONS IN JERUSALEM AND AVDAT) -
DAY

Roman soldiers lead Jesus through the peasant streets outside
Golgtha The blood has dried on his tunic He still wears
his thorny crown

The cross-bar Jesus carries scrapes alongside the walls of
the houses because the paths are extremely narrow (high
angle looking down on these open roofed dwellings and the
narrow passageways) They are jammed with people (36-48
fps) Men women children (animals) in the windows and
open doorways try to get a glimpse of Jesus The atmosphere
has changed Now its just another show A multiple
crucifixion Laughter Ridicule Figs for sale Jesus weakens
Hes knees buckle the weight of the cross-bar throws him

off balance and he falls A Roman soldier pulls him back up

by a rope around his neck

We see close shots of people their faces Their eyes (36-
48 fps) Some turn away Some cry Some are mocking One
woman in a window her head covered with a shawl turns away
(moving 36-48 fps)

CUT TO
EXT GOLGOTHA (ADVAT) - DAY

Golgotha the hill of the skull The rocks are bleached white
There are many crosses most of them with no cross-bars

Some are simply trees with no branches (see DeMassina) One
or two crosses bear half-eaten decomposed corpses On the
ground we see human skulls and bones skeletal arms and
hands mixed with the rocks

A curious crowd has already assembled at the crucifixion
site Toward the rear afraid to approach Magdalene Mary
Martha and Jesus Mother stand in a tight group

The Romans bring Jesus to the peak of the hill and strip
him Two other criminals are prepared for crucifixion

Jesus looks at the rough-hewn cross laid before him (POV
move in) He searches the crowd

JESUS (VO)
Mother Magdalene Where are you

He sees his Mother and tries to gesture to her
JESUS (VO)
(continuing)
Forgive me for being a bad son

TWO SOLDIERS grab Jesus by the arms

FIRST SOLDIER
Alright You Majesty on your throne

They stretch Jesus out on the cross while slave laborers
finish preparing the post hole for the cross

JESUS (VO)
Dont dessert me here Dont leave
me

The Soldiers place the crude spikes against Jesus wrists
The sound of METAL AGAINST METAL rings out as the hammer

comes down (see nail driven through from behind wood)

A bloody mist sprays on Jesus face He grimaces but does
not cry out

Martha and the three Marys hide their faces Near Jesus the
other criminals are being impaled (trees see DeMassina)

The Romans fasten ropes around Jesus arms The spikes alone
will not support his weight

It takes three soldiers to hoist Jesus cross upright Now
suddenly he is above the masses All of Jerusalem is within
view

His body jars in to place The pain is excruciating His
fellow criminals howl in agony

Jesus surveys the mob a sea of hostile faces He finds
Magdalene Mary Martha and his Mother standing together

The Sadducees are satisfied the Romans are complacent Groups
of townspeople and schoolboys point out the sufferings of
the condemned men

JESUS (VO)

(continuing)

Father forgive them

The sky changes color A fierce wind blows across the rocky
hill

Writhing on the cross Jesus looks to heaven and screams

JESUS
Eli Eli

CUT TO
EXT GOLGOTHA - DAY
The sky turns a pleasant pale blue Jesus looks up at the

thick white cumulous clouds floating on the horizon Birds
sing in the distance

He thinks Am I dead No the crowd is still there SILENT
On either side of Jesus his fellow criminals writhe in silent
agony

An old man appears before him standing

JESUS
Who are you

The man does not answer
JESUS
Are you my father

ANGEL
No but I was sent by him Im the
angel who guards you

He is now closer to Jesus

ANGEL
Your father is the God of Mercy not
punishment He saw you and said
Arent you his Guardian Angel Well
go down and save him Hes suffered
enough Remember when he told Abraham
to sacrifice his son Just as Abraham
lifted his knife God saved Isaac
If he saved Abrahams son dont you
think hed want to save his own He
tested you and hes pleased He
doesnt want your blood He said
Let him die in a dream But let him
have his life Come with me

JESUS
All this pain is a dream

ANGEL
Just a dream

In three separate shots the Angel takes out the nails in
Jesus body

First the Angel extracts the nail in the feet then kisses
the wound stopping the flow of blood

Then the Angel does the same to the left hand

Then the same is done on the right hand

In a moment Jesus and the Guardian Angel are standing at the
foot of the cross They pass through the silent crowd
unnoticed Jesus looks over his shoulder his cross is empty

He begins to understand

JESUS
I dont have to be sacrificed
ANGEL
No No you dont

Jesus smiles This is finally the answer hes been waiting
for He is free of God

JESUS
Im not the Messiah

ANGEL
No No youre not

JESUS
Thank God

They start to walk away from the cross down the hill We
still see the crucifixion site in the background

JESUS
What about all the others

ANGEL
Dont look behind God gave you the
gift of life Look ahead

JESUS
But what about the people What will
happen

ANGEL
They can see you crucified Or theyll
see you dead Or they can see you
any way they want

JESUS
What happens later if they see me
alive

ANGEL
Theyll see any one you want them to

see Even you If you want

JESUS
Where are the disciples

Oh they were frightened and ran
away

JESUS
Why has it changed so much

ANGEL
It hasnt changed you have Now

between the earth and the heart

did the soil in Gethsemane

JESUS
Yes

Jesus continues kissing her body
The Guardian Angel steps into the darkened room stands over

blessing

A shadow of a hand falls down across her face and bosom onto
her belly

over She dies as if shes gone to sleep

Where are you going

Jesus doesnt answer but starts to walk -- determined The
Guardian Angel calls after him

ANGEL
Who are you going to kill Jesus

Jesus keeps walking

ANGEL
God Are you going to kill God

Jesus stops and looks back

ANGEL
It was God who killed her

The Guardian Angel holds him in his arms and caresses his
hair and shoulders as he leads him away

ANGEL
God took her at the height of her
happiness Now shes immortal She
wont see her love fade or her flesh
rot away Can she be happier I was
there the whole time he was killing
her and I saw what happened

They sit on a bench near the house

JESUS
But it wasnt right it wasnt
right for him to kill her

ANGEL
You didnt question God when he let
you live You cant question why he
let her die Be patient Trust in
Gods way Listen only one woman
exists in the world one woman with
many faces This one falls the next
one gets up Mary Magdalene died

Two girls play with straw dolls in the dirt beside her

The two youngest children boys race toward Mary One
snatches a doll from one of the girls as they race off again
Mary scolds them as they go

From the distance we hear the SOUND of someone preaching in
the townsquare The voice attracts Jesus attention He calls
to his eldest son

JESUS

CUT TO
EXT TOWNSQUARE —- DAY

Paul -- who we recognize as the Zealot Saul who killed Lazarus --
preaches to a handful of villagers Standing straight

radiating confidence he speaks with the evangelistic fervor

of a born-again Christian

PAUL
I used to be a sinner The worst
sinner I did everything Whored
drank murdered I killed anyone who
violated the Law of Moses Then I
was struck by a burning light anda
voice called to me Saul why are
you persecuting me Why are you
against me Who are you I said
Jesus the voice said and he gave
me my Sight I opened my eyes and I
was baptized and became Paul I bring
the good news to every country

Jesus comes closer the Angel by his side

PAUL
I bring this news About Jesus of
Nazareth He wasnt the son of Mary
he was the son of God His mother
was a virgin The angel Gabriel came
to earth and put Gods seed in her
womb Thats how he was born He
took on our sins he was tortured
crucified -- but three days later he
rose again and was taken up to heaven
Death was conquered praise God
Death was conquered sins were
forgiven and the Kingdom of Heavens
now open to everyone

Jesus can restrain himself no longer He calls out

JESUS
Did you ever see this resurrected
Jesus of Nazareth I mean with your
own eyes

PAUL
No But I saw a blinding flash of
light and I heard his voice

JESUS
Youre a liar

PAUL
His disciples saw him They were
hiding in an attic with the doors
locked when suddenly he appeared
Only one Thomas wasnt convinced
but he put his fingers in his wounds
and gave Jesus some fish which he
ate

JESUS
Liar

(to people around him)
Hes a liar

Disgusted Jesus turns and walks away His angel follows

In the background Paul comes after him
Jesus feels Pauls footsteps drawing closer Hes about to
explode Suddenly he turns on his heel grabs Paul by the
shoulders and shakes him violently

JESUS

(continuing)
Youre a liar Im Jesus of Nazareth
I was never crucified I never came
back from the dead Im a man like
everyone else Why are you spreading
these lies

ANGEL
Quiet

PAUL
What are you talking about

JESUS
Im the son of Mary and Joseph who
preached in Galilee James and John
the sons of Zebedee were my
disciples We marched on Jerusalem
they brought me before Pilate but
God saved me

Jesus Angel doesnt like this conversation he tugs violently
at his sleeve Jesus shoves him aside Paul takes Jesus around
a corner where they wont be seen

PAUL
No he didnt

JESUS
Now I live like a man I have a
family I eat work have children
Do you understand what Im saying
Dont go around the world spreading
these lies about me

(shouts)
Because Ill tell everyone the truth

Now its Pauls turn to explode

PAUL
Look around you Look at these people
Do you see the suffering and
unhappiness in this world Their
only hope is the Resurrected Jesus
I dont care whether youre Jesus or
not The Resurrected Jesus will save
the world -- thats what matters

JESUS
The world cant be saved by lies

PAUL
I created the truth I make it out
of longing and faith I dont struggle
to find truth -- I build it If its
necessary to crucify you to save the
world then Ill crucify you And
Ill resurrect you too whether you
like it or not

JESUS
I wont let you Ill tell everyone
the truth

PAUL
Shout all you want Wholl believe
you You started all this now it
cant be stopped The faithful will
grab you and call you a blasphemer
and throw you in a fire

JESUS
No that wouldnt happen

PAUL

How do you know You dont know how
much people need God You dont know
what a joy it is to hold the cross
to put hope in the hearts of men to
suffer to be killed -- all for the
sake of Christ Jesus Christ Jesus
of Nazareth Son of God Messiah

Jesus is listening intently now

PAUL

(continuing)
Not you Not for your sake

(pause)
Im glad I met you Now I can forget
you My Jesus is much more powerful

Paul returns to the townsquare to preach Jesus exhausted
dazed starts back toward his house The Guardian Angel
faithfully follows

soon

JESUS

Why Are you leaving me

ANGEL
Yes We have to go on Youve grown
old Youve done well Weve both

The Angel looks at Jesus who has suddenly aged to his 80s
Jesus does not react to this transformation
Now SOUNDS of yelling and screaming come from the street A
womans WAIL pierces the air Jesus and the Angel turn to
look

Mary and Martha aged similarly rush from the house Jesus
and the Angel stand

JESUS
What is it

MARTHA
Theyre burning Jerusalem The city
is destroyed

MARY
The Romans are killing everyone

Jesus takes them by their arms

JESUS
Lets go inside

They go inside but Jesus peers out the entrance We see
people running away CAMERA tilts up to the sky which is
red from the flames of Jerusalem (SPECIAL EFFECT)

CUT TO
INT MARY AND MARTHAS - NIGHT

Jesus lies dying He is facing the entrance in which we can
see glimmers of the still-burning sky

Mary and Martha stand close around him Jesus is in no pain
He seems to be at peace

Suddenly looming in the entranceway silhouetted against the
red sky is the figure of an old man He starts down the few
stone steps into the room where Jesus lies He is followed

by two other men The Guardian Angel recognizes them instantly
and starts toward them

PETER
Let us through Were sent by God
(to Jesus)
He told us you would show yourself
to us He said you were dying
JESUS
Is that Peter I cant tell That is
Peter What happened to you

PETER

JESUS

This one I know No matter how old
you get I know This is Philip You
were the best of all shepherds
because you had no sheep They were
all in your head

PHILIP
Have I changed so little in all this
time

JESUS

Only for the better I hope

Jesus points to the mutilated man standing next to Peter
The mans face is a mask of injury he is missing his nose
and one eye and one ear

JESUS
And you They cut out your eye your
ear Your face who are you
JOHN
(bows)
Rabbi
JESUS

JOHN

The Romans tortured me and cut away

PHILIP

Judas is silhouetted in the entranceway

JESUS

Now Judas advances slowly

PETER
He hears you Hes just not going to
say anything

JOHN

Judas

The other disciples stand up

PETER

(reprimanding)
Judas the Master is speaking to

JUDAS
Traitor

Everyone freezes

JUDAS
Traitor Your place was on the cross
Thats where God put you But when
death got too close you ran away
you got scared and ran away and hid
yourself in the life of some man
We did what we were supposed to do
You didnt Youre a coward

PETER
Dont you have any respect

JUDAS
For him He was supposed to save
man But all he did is save himself

JESUS
No You just dont understand

JUDAS
Understand Rabbi you broke my heart
Sometimes I curse the day I ever met
you We held the world in our hands
Remember what you said to me You
took me in your arms do you remember
And you begged me Betray me betray
me I have to be crucified I have
to be resurrected to save the world

The wounds in Jesus hands and feet begin to bleed

JUDAS

(continuing)
T am the lamb you said Death is

door And I loved you so much I
went and betrayed you But you

business do you have here With women
with children whats good for a
man isnt good enough for God Why

Judas is crying

PETER
Look at his wounds Judas Hes
bleeding Youre hurting him thats

JUDAS
He was going to be the New Covenant
Now theres no more Israel
JESUS
But my Guardian Angel

JUDAS
Your Guradian Angel Look at him

All their eyes turn to the Guardian Angel As they watch he
transforms into a death figure in a black monks habit

JUDAS
Satan

Judas looks back at Jesus

JUDAS
If you die this way you die like a
man If you die like that you deny
God Your Father Then theres no
sacrifice Then theres no salvation

Jesus looks over at Mary and Martha then back at the
disciples They have disappeared

He looks again and for the last time at Mary and Martha
Now they are gone too

He is left alone in the room with the death figure

DEATH FIGURE
I told you we would meet again

Jesus starts to try to pull himself up off the floor The
death figure stands in front of him

DEATH FIGURE
Theres nothing you can do You lived
this life You accepted it Its
over now Just finish it and die
like a man

But Jesus starts to crawl across the floor

He crawls past the death figure who watches turning to see
Jesus leave through the entranceway

CUT TO

EXT MARY AND MARTHAS - NIGHT
Jesus crawls into the deserted street The village is still
There is a red glow in the distance Jerusalem is burning

He surveys the empty street Blood still stains his hands
and feet

The old man gets on his hands and knees in the middle of the
road He lifts his head toward heaven

JESUS
Abba father will you still listen
to me Are you still there Will you
listen to a selfish unfaithful son
I fought you when you called I
resisted I thought I knew more I
didnt want to be your son Can you
forgive me I didnt fight hard
enough I want to take your hand I
want to save my fellow men Father
take me back Make a feast Welcome
me home I want to be your son I
want to pay the price I want to be
crucified and rise again I want to
be the Messiah

CUT TO
EXT GOLGOTHA - DAY

Jesus is back on the cross 37 years before The CAMERA tracks
rapidly up his side stopping on his face

He has regained his 33 year-old Nazarene form

All that we have seen since he last cried out in pain has
taken place inside a second He finished his cry

JESUS
lama sabachthani

Jesus looks around realizes where he is The past thirty-
seven years have been a dream He has resisted the last
temptation He looks to heaven and says

JESUS
It is finished
