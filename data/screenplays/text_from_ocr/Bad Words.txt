INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - MORNING

KIDS and FAMILY mill about in front of an elevated stage
bedecked with rows of folding chairs

A giant banner reads

“SOUTHLAND DISTRICT’S 15TH ANNUAL REGIONAL SPELLING BEE
NEXT STOP WASHINGTON DC”

At the snack table GUY DUNCAN disheveled 30s shoves donuts
into the worn pockets of his shitty blazer

CRISPLY DRESSED DAD (0S)
You must be so proud I know I am

Guy looks up to see a CRISPLY DRESSED DAD

CRISPLY DRESSED DAD (CONT’D)
Aren’t kids amazing Which one’s
yours

Guy tears into a donut An avalanche of powdered sugar falls
down his blazer

GUY
(full mouth)
Are you fucking kidding me

Guy shambles away leaving the Dad confused

INT GYMNASIUM STAGE

A PAUNCHY WOMAN in a SALMON COLORED PANTSUIT steps behind the
microphone and dartles a smile out into the gymnasium

SALMON PANTSUIT
OOOOKAY everyone The Spelling Bee
is about to begin so will all of
our noble competitors please take
their seats up on stage

Parents take their seats down below as the students make
their way up on stage

Guy sits between two students up on the stage in the back
row

He looks at the OVERWEIGHT BOY 12 sitting on his left
GUY
Christ Would it kill you to lose
some weight I barely have any
room here

The overweight boy self-consciously looks away
In front Salmon Pantsuit notices Guy sitting up on stage

SALMON PANTSUIT
I’m sorry Sir

Guy morosely looks up

SALMON PANTSUIT (CONT’D)
(precious tone)
These seats are for the
competitors only so if you can
just-

GUY
I am a competitor

Salmon Pantsuit chuckles just for a moment But Guy doesn’t

CUT TO

EXT GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Guy stands outside with Salmon Pantsuit and the TWO OTHER
JUDGES- a SMALL BALD MAN 70s with huge eye GLASSES and a
WOMAN 50s proudly wearing a BEDAZZLED DENIM VEST

Guys sucks on his teeth as all three scrutinize a shitty
tattered PIECE OF PAPER

The Bald Judge puts his huge glasses on making his eyes as
big as planets which startles Guy

BALD GLASSES
(old man forcefulness)
Mr Duncan I’m not going to allow
it You are not eligible In any
fashion way shape or manner

The Bald Judge pulls his huge glasses off

GUY
NO your Honor YOURE OUT OF

ORDER
(MORE)
GUY (CONTD)

Page thirty nine of the Scribbs
National Spelling Bee rule book
Rule Twenty Four Sub point B
Quote “The speller must not have
passed beyond the eighth grade on
or before February 1 2011” That
Sir is a rule made by YOUR
INSTITUTE NOT MINE

(re shitty tattered

paper )
Youre looking at my transcript
Try not to wrinkle it any more than
it is okay As you can see I
havent passed beyond the eighth
grade Not on or before February
1 2011 Not ever

BALD GLASSES
That may be but-

GUY
-Page sixty nine of the Scribbs
Institute National Spelling Bee
rule book Rule Fifty One Sub
Point A “The speller must not have
earned a high school diploma or the
legal equivalent of a high school
diploma” Guess what chicken
butts I haven’t A total of 83
paragraphs five hundred and eighty
one lines of rules in your rule
book and I am complying with every
stupid one of them

BEDAZZLED JUDGE
The Spelling Bee is meant for kids
Not adults who couldn’t even
graduate the 8th Grade

GUY
“Couldnt” “Couldnt” So now
youre saying you won’t let me
participate because you think I’m
stupid Did you just call me
fucking retarded

BEDAZZLED JUDGE
(flustered)
That’s not what I meant at all
SALMON PANTSUIT
There’s no need for such salty
language Mr Duncan

SALMON PANTSUIT (CONT’D)
You don’t have a sponsor present
Every speller must be sponsored by
a nationally published newspaper

JENNY WIDGEON 30s approaches

JENNY
Guy There you are
(to Judges)
Jenny Widgeon Daily Probe- Guy’s
sponsor Sorry I’m late

BALD GLASSES
The Daily Pro- HA That’s not a
newspaper

JENNY
Well let’s not argue over
semantics shall we

GUY
They don’t want to let me
participate

JENNY
(feigning shock gasps)
They don’t want to let you
participate

GUY
And they called me a retarded

Jenny pulls out her cellphone Dials Waits

JENNY
(into cellphone)
You were right Ok Thanks

Jenny slams her cell off

SALMON PANTSUIT
What was that Who did you just
talk to

JENNY
Lead council of The Daily Probe’s
legal team
GUY
They’re more like Piranhas with
scorpion tails for dicks than
actual lawyers

JENNY
As you can guess the Daily Probe
is involved in its fare share of
legal suits and boy do these guys
know how to gum up the works So
in about a half hour you will
receive a Temporary Restraining
Order and Preliminary Injunction
prohibiting the continuation of
this competition until we clear
this whole legal matter up

Jenny cringes whispers

JENNY (CONTD)
Sorry

BEDAZZLED JUDGE
Legal matter This isn’t a legal
matter

GUY
It is now We’re suing the three
of you personally as well as The
Scribbs Institute for
discrimination and fraud for the
amount of ten million dollars

All the color drains out of the Judges’ faces

BALD GLASSES
How dare you try to hijack this
spelling bee You can’t do that

JENNY
Hmm Maybe Maybe not Again

Semantics But getting down to the

bottom of that will take weeks
Months

GUY
Until then no spelling bee Hey
can I at least stay to watch you
tell that entire gymnasium full of
kids and parents that they won’t
get their shot at the Nationals

Salmon Pantsuit nervously looks at the other

judges
She has no choice it seems

SALMON PANTSUIT
(resigned)
The rules are the rules I guess

Salmon Pantsuit eyeballs Jenny’s phone

SALMON PANTSUIT (CONT’D)
So can you just

JENNY
Oh right Yes Certainly

Jenny speed dials her cellphone

JENNY (CONTD)
Yep Yep Yeeep Okay

Jenny hangs up the phone

JENNY (CONTD)
Well okay Looks like we have a
spelling bee to get to

Salmon Pantsuit looks like she swallowed a wasp

INT GYMNASIUM JUDGES TABLE
A crowd of concerned parents has bloomed around the table

SALMON PANTSUIT
There’s nothing we can do about the
loophole he found He’s clearly an
alcoholic or a drug tweaker I
think the least unpleasant option
is to just humor his derangement a
bit let him participate and when
he loses his pathetic reality of a
life will sink in The best child
will win I assure you Social
justice will prevail Don’t you
all believe in your kids I do

The parents nod
SALMON PANTSUIT (CONT’D)
Then let’s be the bigger people in

this situation mkay

Bedazzled Vest sadly hits a crude buzzer The parents in the
audience “AWWWs” but applauds with appreciation for the
attempt

Guy’s laughter erupts over it all

Mole lowers his head Charlie Brown style and walks off the
stage

The applause dies down and everyone sits uncomfortably as
Guy’s laughter continues to ring through the gymnasium

Back in the seats Jenny shakes her head from Guy’s
obnoxiousness

Finally Guy finishes dabs his eyes

GUY
Oh so pathetic Hoo

Guy notices everyone’s waiting for him

(Horrified Surprised)
That’s- That’s correct

Nobody applauds Just silent shock

Back at his seat an evil smile creeps across Guy’s face as
he addresses the kids sitting around him

GUY
I hope all of your pillow cases are
waterproof because tonight they’re
gonna be soaked with lots of nerdy
little snot tears Boo hoo hoo

TITLE BAD WORDS

EXT GYMNASIUM PARKING LOT - LATER

GUY RUNS OUT WITH THE GIANT FIRST-PLACE TROPHY TUCKED UNDER
HIS ARM

An ANGRY MOB of parents burst out after him throwing coffee
cups and donuts

Jenny screeches her car to a stop in Guy’s path
JENNY
(half reluctant)
GET IN IF YOU WANT TO LIVE
Guy quickly piles in and slams down the lock

A HOME BAKED MOM hawks an angry LOOGI on the window right
level with Guy’s face

As the loogi drips down the window the Crisply Dressed Dad
rushes the car and screams

CRISPLY DRESSED DAD

The car peels out of the parking lot just as Crisply Dressed

Guy walks up the aisle to the lavatory as FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
rush past him to the screaming boy

CUT TO
ESPN INTRO
Sweeping music rises as
A Camera pans across an empty mid-western school auditorium

A COLLAGE of children’s voices start spelling random letters
but all at once

NARRATOR
Can you hear the buzz of the bee

Various shots of spellers in moments of victory and defeat

NARRATOR (CONTD)
The buzz that started long ago We
all have our memories of when we
first heard it

Various shots of chairs with numbers Of dictionary pages
flipping

NARRATOR (CONTD)
An old school-time competition is
about to capture your imagination

The music starts to swell

NARRATOR (CONTD)
We all have our hometown heroes
But the genius of these competitors
is spellbinding

Images of victorious kids pop up one after another

NARRATOR (CONTD)
And like bees to honey our lust
for competition leads us hungrily
to the epicenter of this quest for
greatness

Images of one teen after another taking the giant check from
SCRIBBS COO BILL BOWMAN 60s- executively handsome for his
age

NARRATOR (CONTD)
The prize is just a word away and
those who compete want to take that
check from the Legendary Scribbs
COO Bill Bowman Theyve dreamed
of it all their lives

Images of teens holding up the spelling bee trophy

NARRATOR (CONTD)
And thats why its the drama of
“The Bee So can you hear the
buzz Well can you

The images suddenly turn to MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL type
graphics as the faint sound of bee buzzing morphs into the
robotic WHUP WHUP WHUP of military helicopters as

TWO ROBOT WARRIOR BEES FLY IN FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE
SCREEN AND COLLIDE WITH A VIOLENT MECHANICAL EXPLOSION TO
BLARING ELECTRIC GUITARS

Suddenly TWO YUCKITY YUCK ANNOUNCERS appear in the ballroom
auditorium in front of the stage

CHUCK
Welcome everyone to the 85th annual
Scribbs Institute National Spelling
Bee I’m Chuck Wilde coming at you
live from the Historic State Plaza
Hotel here in the heart of our
country’s only capital Washington
DC

PETE
And I’m Peter Yates Chuck over
the years the popularity of the
National Spelling Bee has grown to
sick proportions and this year
viewership promises to rival that
of any championship sporting event

CHUCK
You don’t have to spell that out
for me Pete What can we say
The world loves a good showdown and
what A Showdown It will be
Let’s get to know some of this
year’s most noteworthy alphabet
gladiators

From here on out all broadcast graphics of names will be
produced by these violent mechanical bees blowing things up
and shooting lasers with their stingers

Thunderous music plays over montages of pre-filmed in-studio
shots of competitors standing awkwardly for the camera

The insane graphics and production go totally against the
grain of how nerdy they all actually are

JOYCE SACKS 14 years-old with pigtails acne and a crooked
grin

PETE (VO)
Joyce Sacks A fourteen year old
spelling assassin hailing from
Plymouth Minnesota Came in 8th
last year but this year retreat is
not an option Word has it that
she’s been working with three
different coaches- one for English
one for Greek and one for Latin-
and she’s ready to declare “All
your bases are belong to us”
Next BAXTER FLOURNEY 9 BRACES and a BOWL HAIRCUT
complimented by uncomfortable glances at the camera

CHUCK (VO)
That kid with braces stealing your
soul with his death stare Oh
nothing just nine year-old mind
killer Baxter Flourney from
Worcester Massachusetts His Dad
crushed the National Spelling Bee
in 1980 at the age of 9 Last
year his older brother Benjamin
beheaded first place at the age of
9 And what does this mean The
Bee runs thick in his blood and
he’s about spill some of his
competition’s

Next Chaitanya the boy from the airplane

PETE (VO)
Some say that twelve year-old
Chaitanya Chopra from Olathe
Kansas has ice for blood Others
say that if you opened up his skull
youd find Stephen Hawking AND
Albert Einstein in a mixed martial
arts fight Whatever the truth is
Chaitanya has placed third for the
last two years and he isn’t going
to take it anymore He’s focused
He wants it And word on the
street is he’s gonna spine-rip
anyone who gets in his way

The graphics explode to reveal ERIC TAI 14- weird is an
understatement

CHUCK (VO)
Don’t let his virgin exterior fool
you Eric Tai from San Diego
California is an absolute spelling
bee Mongoose Two years ago he
placed second Last year he lost
by a syllable to Benjamin Flourney
One syllable Now Eric wants to
proverbially pop out of the Mekong
Delta with a knife in his mouth and
disembowel the final round

Next we see a montage of rough video footage of Guy
constantly walking away from the camera and flipping the
bird

PETE (VO)

And finally in what has been the
strangest turn of events in Bee
history we have contestant Guy
Duncan from St Louis Missouri
Oh did we forget to mention
Guy’s thirty four years-old This
man has made huge waves in the
competitive spelling world by
exposing and capitalizing on a
loophole in the competition’s
rules and OH MAMA Have things
been topsy-turvy But he’s here
and the only way we’re gonna get
rid of him is if he loses

Finally we see quick footage cuts of Scribbs COO Bill Bowman
all around the world Spoon feeding a hungry African child
skydiving Ostrich racing climbing to the top of a human
tower in Sardinia

CHUCK (VO)
And all of this spelling bee action
is constantly promoted lauded and
endorsed by one of America’s most
charismatic COOs Scribbs
Institute’s own Bill Bowman

We cut to a LIVE SATELLITE FEED of Bowman donning an X-Games
helmet being harnessed to a zipline that stretches beyond
the fiery lip of a volcano

CHUCK (VO) (CONTD)
We have Mr Bowman joining us on a
live feed right now to share a few
words

BOWMAN
Thanks Chuck Pete I’m sorry I’m
not in town yet I’m at the mouth
of the Kilauea Volcano on the
island of Kauai as I zipline
across all the major volcanos of
the world in my ongoing attempt to
raise awareness about the literacy
epidemic in America You know
it’s a lot more dangerous than it
looks- and I’m talking about our
literacy rate not the ziplining
But never fear I’1ll make it to
Washington in time to hand out
first prize to our next National
Spelling Bee champion Who will be

the next champion I don’t know
(MORE )

BOWMAN (CONTD)
But I’1l tell you this you can’t
be a Bee champion unless youve
shown honor sportsmanship and
integrity It’s just impossible
As always I can’t wait to meet all
of our noble competitors Well
most of them I’11 be arriving
with high hopes as well as that
much loved giant check

Bowman turns away from the camera gives the people around
him a thumbs-up and ZIPLINES OVER THE VOLCANO

Director Deagan pulls out a competitor number from her desk

DIRECTOR DEAGAN (CONT’D)

She moves around the table and hangs it around Guy’s neck

DIRECTOR DEAGAN (CONT’D)
You think you’re smart because you
found a loophole- and youre taking
advantage of it B-R-A-V-O But I

the poorest speller in this
competition So may this number
serve as the noose you hang
yourself by

GUY

other thing I personally arranged
your hotel accommodations for you

CHAITANYA (CONTD)

Toys are fun to have when you can’t
play with other kids What was
your favorite toy as a kid

GUY

I had a toy car once It was this
shitty little matchbox police car
It never left my pocket But one
night as we were ditching this one
apartment it fell out of my pocket

when you’re always studying

GUY

GUY
So tell me Chaiwala you got a
girlfriend I was just joking I

CHAITANYA

feel up has nipples

GUY

CHAITANYA

nipples No

America’s disappointment Guy only
suffered minor injuries and will be

that Director Deagan has been
removed from her position and that
he himself will oversee the final
round today And we are fortunate
enough to have Mr Bowman with us
in Washington DC right now

Bowman steps into frame

BOWMAN
Thank you Chuck I would like to
take the opportunity to address
this unique situation to everyone
watching out there I regret the
alleged actions of former Director
Bernice Deagan As you know I
myself am a former bee champ
Before I became one of the most
influential and powerful executives
in America I learned first hand
that the bee is about
sportsmanship not assault and
battery I look forward to moving
past this ugly incident and am very
excited to personally crown our
next National Spelling Bee Champ
whoever that may be

CHUCK
From your lips to God’s ears
Pete take it away
