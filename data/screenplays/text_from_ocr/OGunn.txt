EXT SCOTLAND NIGHT
GRAPHIC SCOTLAND

BAGPIPES sound for a brief introductory moment We see FOG
The fog lefts to reveal a RUINED CASTLE We PAN TO a HILL
over-looking the ruined castle Finally we ZOOM IN on a
CAMPFIRE in the center of the hill As we get closer we see
who’s around the campfire A GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN and PIVE
WEE LADS

GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN
Gather ‘round me wee lads and feast
yer ears on a tale like none ye’ve
ever heard before ‘Tis the story
of Charlie O’Gunn Not just the
greatest cop in ali Scotlandbut
the greatest cop in the fucking
universe

WEE LAD 1
Is it true he cannot be killed

GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN
Aye Charlie O’Gunnimmortal he
is

WEE LAD 2
But I heard his mother was of
mortal flesh

GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN
Nay The good lass that raised
O’‘Gunn as if he was her own was not
his birth mother O’Gunn had no
birth mother

WEE LAD 3
Bollocks

GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN
Tis true young one Tis true
There are numerous accounts of how
Charlie O’Gunn came into this
world but I know his true origin
There was a fair kind-hearted
lass a bawdy barmaid in Glasgow
She was dreadfully in love with a
seaman who had joined the Royal
Navy and had committed himself to a
life at sea This seaman had sent
her letters which she cherished
and held close to her ample chest

(MORE)
She longed for the day in which her
seaman would return But alas over
time the letters stopped and there
was no seaman to be had Driven a
wee bit mad by the heartache this
fair lass took to witchcraft in
hopes of conjuring her seaman back -
to her

GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN (cont qd)

GRIZZLED OLD MAN leans into the WEE LADS we see the campfire
reflected in his eyes

‘ GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN (CONTD)
So it was that one day she placed
the three things this seaman
cherished most in a dank corner of
‘ the pub A bottle of 18 year-old
Macallan scotch a raw slab of
‘ steak and a fully loaded hand-gun
F The fair lass would never touch
these itemsand years passed and
these items remained untouched The
fair lass soon crossed over from
this life to the nextand her
y younger sister took over as the
barkeep One day a baby’s cry was
heard from this dank corner of the
pub

WEE LAD 45 (0S)
It wasn’t

i GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN
AYE It was the infant Charlie 0’
Gunn He was born of scotch steak
and gun

WEE LAD 5 (0S)

Holy shite

GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN
Holy shite Nay It was divine
shite This is why O’Gunn walks the
walk of the Gods This is why
O’Gunn struts the strut of Divine
Machismo

A GUN RISES from the flames

a fucking madman

GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN (V0)
O’Gunn

Again we hear a DISSONANT HORN BLAST

We keep CUTTING back and forth between CLOSE-UPS of the gun
and O’GUNN The rate between CUTS increases as does the
GRIZZLED OLD SCOTSMAN’s voice and DISSONANT HORN BLASTS
“Gun OGUNN Gun OGUNN” The effect should be maddening
and hypnotic

Finally this stops ‘

We PULL BACK to reveal O’GUNN siting at the airport bar
staring at the gun Albert King’s “Born Under A Bad Sign”
piays in the background O’GUNN is dressed like a police
detective A grey suit with a disheveled collar Above 0’GUNN
on a television is a news report

We ZOOM IN on the TV and see a NEWS REPORTER outside an
observatory lined in police-tape

NEWS REPORTER

Sources say the LAPD are puzzled by
last night’s theft of the Lance
Bixby telescope The motive behind
such a crime remains unclear
although a chief suspect has been
named Evidence found at the scene
points to international terrorist
GODFREE LOVEJOY The first
indication that Lovejoy was
involved in the theft was a half-
smoked clove cigarette whose filter
was embroidered in azure ink with
the initials “GL”

(beat)
The second piece of evidence lies
in this security cam footage

Grainy footage appears on the screen It shows a man in his
early thirties He has shaggy hair He is thin and his
motions are vaguely feminine This is GODFREE LOVEJOY (30s)
The Brit hipster terrorist Hes dressed in tight-fitting
black corduroy pants a green turtleneck sweater a tweed
walking hat and a long orange and black scarf wrapped around
his neck

GODFREE LOVEJOY takes a defiant drag of his clove cigarette
and flicks the butt at the camera

CUT TO

O’GUNN snarling at the TV and then turning back to his gun on
the bar

ASSHOLE (0S)

OGUNN places the gun into his holster and turns around We
now see the ASSHOLE (30s) that’s addressing him Hes a big
guy with a shaved head and muscular arms These arms are
covered with tatoos

ASSHOLE
Yeah The world-famous copfrom
Scotland right

O‘GUNN nods with resignation and turns away

ASSHOLE

I know all about your exploits
Stopping Al-Qaeda at the Running of
the Bulls Dismantling that dirty
bomb in Big Ben I heard it all

(tilts his head cockily)
They say youre the toughest cop on
the planet They say you can’t be
killed They say youve got two
extra testicles in place of a
brain

O’GUNN looks down at the pint of Guinness before him and nods
somberly

ASSHOLE (CONT’D)

But I don’t see it bro Sounds
like a bunch of fantasy bullshit
Like the Loch Ness monster and
Leprechauns

0’ GUNN
(not looking up)
What kind of man doesn’t believe in
the little people

ASSHOLE

fake O’Gunn That’s right I went

ASSHOLE is taken aback

ASSHOLE
Wow Thanks That’s really cool of
you man

The BARTENDER hands O’‘GUNN a bottle reading “Fredwin 75 The
Universe’s Only 120 Proof Single Malt”

O’GUNN turns to the ASSHOLE who has a friendly look of
approval

And then 0GUNN smashes the bottle over the ASSHOLEs head

hair and dresses like a police detective A tan suit with a
badge He has a nervous and frustrated demeanor BULLETT
holds up a sign that reads “CHARLIE O’GUNN” When BULLETT
Speaks he speaks in a thick over-affected Spanish accent

the background

BULLETT is crashed into by several people BULLETT quickly
looks around and sees that he’s entered a full-scale airport
bar brawl

A punch lands in BULLETT’s face and he reflexively punches
back

In a blur BULLETT is caught up in the bar brawl and in an
even quicker blur we see that O’GUNN and BULLETT are fighting
back-to-back

O’GUNN

bottle to give this ASSHOLE the mother of all smashes

BULLETT smiles

But then O’GUNN takes the cap off the bottle and drains it
all in mid-brawl

The running ASSHOLE slams smack into BULLETT and tackles him
to the ground Then the rest of the ASSHOLES pile on BULLETT

O’GUNN makes his way to the bar and grabs a pint of ale

through the parking lot They are in mid-conversation

0‘ GUNN
Well a bastard like Lovejoy isn’t

Haley Joel’s comet now is he lad
It‘ll be for something rotten I
wager

BULLETT
Exactamundo And our department is
ill-equipped to deal with
rottenness from an international
terrorist
(beat)
You understand what we’re asking

CUT TO

EXT CAFE BY THE ROAD A HILLY AREA OF LOS ANGELES - LATER

On the side of the road is a nice little cafe An OLD MAN
speaks to a MAN AND WOMAN (his grandchildren in their 30s)
They all seam very prim and proper There’s a cake in front
of the OLD MAN with a candle shaped like the number “80” The
OLD MAN blows it out and lets out a deep sigh

OLD MAN

When I was your age my grandfather
told me the Bradford family secret
When my 80th birthday came he told
me I should in turn tell that
secret to my own grandchildren And
theyyouwould use it to live
the happiest of all possible lives
and to invest and save for
generations of Bradfords to come
So promise me you will honor his
word

(leaning towards them

intensely)
Swear to me

YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN
We swear

OLD MAN
Very well

The YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN lean in hanging on the revelation

OLD MAN (CONT’D)

The official story is that your
great great great grandfather
made his fortune in tobacco This
is untrue He made his money in
gold He was an explorer and an
archaeologist In the Summer of
1799 he went to Mexico He was not
an honest man but he was clever
and devious He returned to America
with over five hundred holy relics
cast entirely in solid gold This
is what enabled the Bradford family
to weather whatever storms God and
the economy throw our way By
today’s reckoning those relics are
worth over a billion dollarsand
this treasure is buried not twenty
miles from where we sit There’s an
old ridge with a secret access
tunnel in it right next to--

YOUNG WOMAN
Where

YOUNG MEN
Please tell us

OLD MAN
The Bradford family’s gold can be
found in--

Just then BULLETT’s CAR flies over a hill and goes crashing
through the cafe at an incredible amount of speed The OLD
MAN is picked off as the car barrels through The MAN AND
WOMAN gawk in horror Their grandfather and his secret gone
forever

both hands

0’ GUNN

BULLETT
(terrified pointing at
the steering wheel)

O’Gunn

O’GUNN turns to the steering wheel he isn’t steering

O’GUNN

(leaning back smiling)

Oh don’t worry about the steering
wheel It’s more of a suggestion

The CAR goes crashing into a newsstand and takes a violent
swerve It catches on a curb and then goes FLYING AND
TWIRLING IN THE FUCKING AIR

O’GUNN
(unfazed by the spinning)

Our first course of action should

be tracking down any known contacts

of Lovejoy here in Los Angeles We

find one of them and we can shake
‘em down for information give ‘em

the whole bad copworse cop routine-

BULLETT
(terrified)
Were gonna die were gonna die

0’ GUNN
Are you listening to me Bullett
Pull it together man Be a
professional

) The car SLAMS down and O’GUNN steps on the gas Theyre off
again

But before BULLETT can collect himself OGUNN furrows his
brow makes a violent sharp turn and drives right smack into
aconvenience store Glass shatters shelves and items topple
over etc

BULLETT
(baffled as all fuck)
This is the madness you are the

madness

0’ GUNN
I’m just a cop And a damn good
one

(thrusts his finger ahead)
Point your peepers at one o’ clock
laddie

BULLETT follows O’GUNN’s finger and sees that a robbery is in
the process However the two YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN ROBBERS
(both in gang-related attire) are in frozen gun extended
shock They stare at the crashed police car halfway in the
convenience store The KOREAN STORE OWNER is likewise frozen
with arms up

BULLETT
Buthow did you know

O’ GUNN
(squinting as if
suffering from a minor
headache)

Crime makes my balls tingle

O’GUNN gets out of the car He holds up his gun in surrender
as he addresses the two YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN ROBBERS

O’ GUNN
I come in peace ghetto youth Just
need to drain the lizard and grab a
bag of Fritos

YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN ROBBER 1

quickly rolls onto the floor snatches up the lst ROBBER’s
gun In three rapid movements O’GUNN kicks ROBBER 1 down to

hand ROBBER 2 screams drops the gun and O’GUNN throws the
gun he was using at ROBBER 2’s face O’GUNN then leaps over
ROBBER 1 reclaims his own gun and then points it at ROBBER

beats him even more Savagely than before

BULLETT pulls O’GUNN off THE CHIEF again

BULLETT

being an albino

BULLETT
You can’t keep assaulting the
Chief It’s because of him that
you’re here

0‘ GUNN

BULLETT
No It was Chief Angstrom that
requested your help

O’ GUNN
So this is all part of an elaborate
albino trap

Again THE CHIEF gets up straightens himself out and
addresses O’GUNN

Make it known that godfree is culprit

CHIEF ANGSTROM

No O’Gunn This is about Godfree

Lovejoy His reign of terror is
reaching an epoch of terror And
this epoch involves the recently
stolen Lance Bixby telescope The
concentration of his agents in the
Los Angeles area confirms this We

is an astronomical plot afoot

What is this crackin’

O’ GUNN

O‘GUNN closes his eyes having a flashback as he drives
recklessly

DISSOLVE TO

EXT EURO DISNEYWORLD-LIKE THEME PARK - THE PAST

Through a haze (because this is the past) we see a figure
standing atop a stalled roller coaster It’s a younger
GODFREE LOVEJOY He’s wearing a modish suit that looks like
something Paul McCartney would have worn circa mid 1960s He
also has a tommy gun extended into the air A STRAY CAT
crawls up next to LOVEJOY The STRAY CAT begins licking its
paws LOVEJOY scans below Fires are burning throughout the
park At the bottom of the coaster is a bloody O’GUNN He is
surrounded by the bloody and burned corpses of men women and

children

O’GUNN
(staring up weakly)
Why Lovejoy What twisted maggot
in your brain compels you to such
savagery

GODFREE LOVEJOY

Things bore me O’Gunn
Institutions buildings people
cats

(kicks the cat off the

roller coaster)
I think you bore me the most A
myopic cop that must always get the
bloody job done Look around What
do you see You probably see
destruction and lawlessness Well
I see a paradise for all us brave
souls that detest monotony and wish
to fight back

O’GUNN
Stick a cock in it College Boy
You’re a bad guy and I’m a good guy
and we both know how this is going
to end

GODFREE LOVEJOY
Hold that thought good guy
(unzips his fly)
This bad guy is going to pour you a
libation

LOVEJOY cackles as he pisses a long STREAM OF PISS onto
O’GUNN

GODFREE LOVEJOY
Cheers Chuckles

O’GUNN’s face twists in impotent rage and despair

O’GUNN grimaces at his reflection in the driver’s side window
and takes another swig of scotch

BULLETT
He killed a cat and pissed on you

O’GUNN
Yeah
(looks down and sighs)
Not the brightest day in O’Gunn
Land

BULLETT regards O’GUNN with a bit of sympathy
O’GUNN suddenly looks up and smiles

O’GUNN
Oh We’re here

BULLETT looks up and screams as they crash into a brick wall

CUT TO

INT LOVEJOYS BASE CONSERVATORY THAT DAY

This is not the typical bad-guy stronghold It looks more
like the penthouse of a wealthy gay man featured in
Architectural Digest It’s furnished lavishly with long
drapes throw pillows and gold chenille is everywhere In the
center of a conservatory is the LANCE BIXBY TELESCOPE It is
pointing out of a hole in the roof Several SCARF THUG
TECHNICIANS are working on it

GODFREE LOVEJOY witnesses all of this with a pleased yet
somewhat bored expression He’s in his turtle-neck scarf and
walking hat He smokes a clove cigarette and leans on a cane
with an owl head

Standing next to LOVEJOY is a sexy woman in a tight grey
business suit This is NATALYA NIKOLAEVNA (20s) an Eastern
European power lesbian She holds a chain leash in her hand
At the end of the leash is an attractively nerdy girl She is
dirty and looks miserable This is EMMA (late teens early
20s)

GODFREE LOVEJOY

Byron)
“Ye stars Which are the poetry of
heaven”

Natalya darling Which cane looks
better with this terrorist plot

much yes

with simplicity That’s the way to
put this garish ugly world on red
alert

Oh I never asked who your new
bitch was Thoughtless of me I

Now stay focused

BULLETT tries desperately to control himself as he looks
around

BULLETT
Are you sure this is the place

O‘GUNN
Id bet my ball brains on it The
intel I got says that Dagger Nails
owns this place He’s been
supplying Lovejoy with weapons of
limited mass destruction since the
late 90s All we have to do is go
inside find Dagger beat the
living fuck out of him and then get
a nice steak Medium rare
Preferably cooked over several
different kinds of wood It drives
me fucking mental when a steak is
cooked with gas

BULLETT
How is that going to be help to us

(incredulous)
It’s a steak lad Medium rare
It’ll put hair on your chest and
give you boners from here to
eternity

BULLETT
Don‘t you think instead of just
beating up this Dagger Nails and
getting a steak we should try to
find out if he’s shipped any arms
recently Couldn’t that maybe lead
us to Lovejoy

O’GUNN
That’s the most brilliant idea I’ve
ever heard in all my years of
police workHow do you know such
things
(whispering)
Are you from the Future

BULLETT groans and opens the door to the Pet Store

CUT To

INT PET STORE - CONTINUOUS
BULLETT and O’GUNN enter the pet store

We see all manner of cages Inside these cages are animals
(dogs cats chimpanzees ferrets a star-nosed mole etc)
These animals are dressed in BONDAGE GEAR

BULLETT
(aghast)
Holy mother of shit

O’ GUNN
Avoid the beasts’ eyes Bullett
That’s how the savage harlots
seduce you

They walk through the aisles and eventually come across the
register Behind this register is a seedyyet-geeky white
dude in his early 20s He is smoking a pipe that looks like a
SKULL He also wears a headset with a microphone This is
DAGGER NAILS Next to the register is a computer DAGGER
plays “World of Warcraft”

DAGGER NAILS
(into headset)
Yeah Yeah Thaz right niggah I
just pwned yo shit aggro style

ANGLE ON Computer monitor

We see a graphic representation of DAGGER NAILS in full armor
with a large glowing sword standing over a vanquished digital
village

ANGLE ON DAGGER’s crazed face

DAGGER NAILS
“Dagger my niggah What is best in
life” To crush mothafuckas To see
mothafuckas driven before you And
to hear the lamentations of the
mothafuckas’ women

ANGLE ON Computer monitor

We see that DAGGER’s character has bent over a female
villager and is fucking her from behind

DAGGER NAILS
Tha’s right Dagger Nails puttin’
the “rape” back in “rape and
pillage”

O’GUNN and BULLETT approach the register

BULLETT
Excuse me

DAGGER furiously rips off his headset and turns to the two
cops

DAGGER NAILS
Fuck you want niggah

0’ GUNN
(chuckling)
Youve got it all wrong laddie
(gesturing to BULLETT)
He’s not a niggah He’s a filthy
spic

BULLETT
(ignoring 0’GUNN)
We’re here to ask you a few
questions

DAGGER NAILS
Wha About my dick This is so

DAGGER NAILS

0’ GUNN

OGUNN spits in BULLET’s face

BULLET
What the--

O’GUNN grabs BULLETT by the collar violently

O’GUNN
It’s hoity-toity bitches like
yourself that give homosexuals a
bad name I have half a mind to
beat your brains out all over this
spectacular human being

O’GUNN gestures to a confused DAGGER

BULLETT
O’Gunn What the fuck are you
doing

O’GUNN

POLICE WORK

OGUNN spins from BULLETT and whips his gun out With his
other hand he grabs DAGGER by the back of the head and slams
his skull down on the desk As soon as DAGGER’s head bounces
i off the desk and it looks as if he’s about to fall over
backwards from the recoil O‘GUNN shoves the gun in DAGGER’s
mouth-it’s as if he’s keeping him from falling backwards by
having the gun in DAGGER’s mouth

0’ GUNN
Ah ah ah Stay upright

BULLETT
(still fucked-up)
Crazy Scottish motherfucker What
were you--

O’GUNN
Mind on the job Bullett We’1l
talk about your choice of
obstetrician later Now start
grilling him Make him sing like
Thin Lizzy

BULLETT hesitates You have to understand in O’Gunn’s
presence Bullett is always on the verge of a complete nervous
breakdown

BULLETT
(gathering strength)
Okay Mister Nails What can you
tell us about Godfree Lovejoy

DAGGER NAILS
(defiantly gun still in
mouth mumbled)

Goah ugh ersehl

O’ GUNN
What‘d he say Bullett My “Gun-In-
Mouthish” is kind of rusty

BULLETT
He said “Go fuck yourself”

0’ GUNN
Hmm Okay Well you go over there
and masturbate and I’ll see if I
have any better luck

O’GUNN takes the gun out of DAGGER’s mouth but keeps the
barrel pointed at him O’GUNN reaches into his jacket and
takes out the bottle of scotch

O’ GUNN
You gonna tell Uncle Charlie
everything he wants to know about
Godfree Lovejoy

DAGGER NAILS
I tell you what I told him Go fuck
yourself

0’ GUNN

Not gonna happen Charlie O’Gunn
doesn’t fuck himself Charlie
O’Gunn fucks Mrs O’Gunn She’s a
woman I also fuck other women

(looks around cautiously

and then turns back to

DAGGER )
But that’s on the DL Anyway watch
this

In an unbelievable display of drinking prowess O’GUNN drains
the entire bottle of scotch in several gulps BULLETT and
DAGGER stare in wide-eyed amazement

O’ GUNN

(wiping mouth)
The thing about draining a whole
bottle like that is that it makes
you have to take a wicked piss

(to BULLETT)
Get a rag We’re gonna waterboard
the son of a bitch

O’GUNN unzips his pants

BULLETT
Wait Wait For just once could
you not go all crazy apeshit
There’s other ways to find out what
we need for Christ’s sake

O‘GUNN
Wellif it’s for Christ’s sake
I‘ll listen I like Christ Good
kid
(beat)
Bit of a hippie though

BULLETT goes behind the desk and fiddles with DAGGER’s
computer

DAGGER NAILS
What are you doing You can’t do
that You need a warrant

ANGLE ON Computer Monitor
We see DAGGER’s inbox and a message marked “From Lovejoy32”

BULLETT clicks on it and it brings up a video email We see
© GODFREE LOVEJOY himself

GODFREE LOVEJOY

Mister Nails Just wanted to say
thanks for that last shipment Many
are those in this sad world who
continually disappoint Consider
yourself amongst the elected few
that over-deliver whilst others
over-promise

(beat)
Cheers Mister Nails

BULLETT (0S)
Well that didn’t tell us anything
we--

GODFREE LOVEJOY
Oh and you might also like to know
that the plot is going smashingly
The Earth will never be the same a
fortnight from today

BULLETT
A fortnight What is “a fortnight”

O’GUNN

I take it you’re not a member of
the Jane Austin Book Club A
fortnight is a unit of time equal
to two weeks that is 14 days or
literally 14 nights Nancy boys
like the term

(ponders)
That bastard’s up to something all
right Something downright
catastrophic I wager

BULLETT
(grabbing DAGGER NAILS)
Where is he Where is Lovejoy
now Tell me or I will Jack Bauer
your ass

O’GUNN
You better tell him Nails
Bullett’s got one of those hot-—
blooded Latino erections And from
where I’m standing it’s a rager

DAGGER NAILS
Alright Alright I’1l talk

BULLETT slowly lets go of DAGGER

DAGGER NAILS
PSYCHE

DAGGER rolls to the floor in a blur
O’GUNN

Ha Ha He psyched you out

Bullett You suck
DAGGER pushes a button underneath the desk
We then go into QUICK CUTS inside every cage where every
animal is being injected by a metal arm with a syringe marked
“Mind Control Methamphetamine”

All the cages then OPEN UP sending a menagerie of crazed
drugged up animals into the store

DAGGER NAILS
Kill them my critters

The BONDAGE GEAR ANIMALS charge towards O’GUNN and BULLETT as
DAGGER makes a break for it

O’GUNN
Bullett Give me your gun

BULLETT hands it over without thinking
The BONDAGE GEAR ANIMALS come closer

O’GUNN (CONT’D)
The one in your ankle holster too

BULLETT hands over the small 38 Revolver
The BONDAGE GEAR ANIMALS come even closer

O’GUNN (CONTD)
Great You take care of these furry
little fuckers Im going after
Nails

O’GUNN runs off after DAGGER NAILS

BULLETT
Hey Come back My guns I need
them Without them I am weaponless

Too late O’GUNN is O’Gone BULLETT turns back to the BONDAGE
GEAR ANIMALS and is confronted by a SILVERBACK GORILLA
dressed up like The Gimp in Pulp Fiction

BULLETT
It is like I‘m in a PETA
revenge fantasyand yet I’m a
vegetarian and do not wear the
cosmetics

The SILVERBACK swings at BULLETT and sends him flying into
empty cages

CUT TO

EXT LOS ANGELES STREETS - CONTINUOUS

DAGGER runs hard O’GUNN is about thirty yards behind him
DAGGER stops turns around produces a gun and fires three
shots ALL OF THE SHOTS HIT O’GUNN but he keeps on running

O’GUNN
(laughing his ass off)
I cannot die MacLeod

DAGGER starts running again

They turn corners overturn carts etc DAGGER turns and
shoots again hitting O’GUNN in the arm

O’ GUNN
(looking at arm)
Hmm That one kind of stung

DAGGER runs again so does O’GUNN As they turn another
corner O’GUNN sprains his ankle

O’ GUNN
HOLY HELLFIRE

O’GUNN falls to the sidewalk He is in agonizing pain

DAGGER hears the cry and stops running A smile crosses his
face He has O’GUNN where he wants him

O’GUNN stands up but has to hobble on one leg

O’GUNN
(to ankle)
Work damn you

O’GUNN points the barrel of his gun at his ankle

O’GUNN (CONT ’D)
Work or I swear to God I’ll shoot
you right now

A bullet hits right next to O’GUNN’s head DAGGER is
approaching and emptying his gun

After a bit O’GUNN seeks shelter in a high rise and gets
inside an elevator

DAGGER gives up the chase when he hears police sirens

CUT TO

INT HIGH RISE BUILDING HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The elevator opens and we see O’GUNN holding his leg up his
ankle right at his face

O’ GUNN
(to ankle)
You ever pull a stunt like that
again and I‘1l ship you to
Australia Understood
(beat)
Good

He puts his leg down and we can tell that he’s walking just
fine again

O° GUNN
(looking around)
Now where the fuck am I

O’GUNN looks up and down the office and sees signs that read
“Lou-Anne Markey For Senate” Young men and women bustle back
and forth through the hallway occasionally darting in and
out of glass-paneled offices

Peering into one of the offices O’GUNN sees a very buxom and
attractive YOUNG LATINO WOMAN (20s) She’s addressing a
middle-aged woman in a smart suit While addressing the woman
she points at a chalkboard that has “Foreign Policy Concerns”
written on it The YOUNG LATINO WOMAN concludes her address
shakes hands and then leaves the office O’GUNN follows the
YOUNG LATINO WOMAN to a small alcove where she pours herself
a cup of coffee

O’ GUNN
Youre goddamn hot I1l give you
five hundred dollars for the entire
package

YOUNG LATINO WOMAN
What

O’GUNN
Sorry I follow the doctrine of pre-
emptive whore

YOUNG LATINO WOMAN
(more shocked than
offended)
INo one has ever talked to me in
such a way

O’GUNN sizes her up in blatantly lecherous appraisal We see
shots (OGUNN’s P0V) of her body snug hotly into a little
business suit High-heels leading up to shapely hips in a
brown skirt a tight waist leading up to jawdropping cleavage
in a burgundy blouse and brown jacket and raven hair flowing
over her shoulders O’GUNN nods This chick has his name on
her

O’GUNN
And no one will ever love you like
Charlie O’Gunn will love That‘s
right I used the word “love”
Twice if youre into the counting
game Know why I’m so loose with
that word around you ma’am

(MORE)

O’GUNN (contd)
I’1l tell ya
(leaning in with a gruff
seductive whisper)
Cause I love you

YOUNG LATINO WOMAN
(not knowing quite how to
respond)
You’reyou’re insane

O‘GUNN

Is it insane to see that you’re the
most alluring and erotically etched
creature to ever grace this coarse
landscape of Mortal Man I don’t
call that “insane” love I call
that having body parts And these
“body parts” of mine desire nothing
more than to dance with your body
parts

YOUNG LATINO WOMAN
Does thatverbiage usually work
Well
(places arms defiantly
akimbo)
It didnt work on this alluring and
erotically etched creature Mister

O’Gunn

O’ GUNN
Oh really

YOUNG LATINO WOMAN
Really

O’ GUNN
May I investigate
YOUNG LATINO WOMAN

(with a perplexed look)
Sure But I don’t--

O’GUNN swoops his hand up her skirt and thrusts his arm
upward

O’GUNN
What do we have here

The YOUNG LATINO WOMAN closes her eyes and emits one fuck of
a Moan

O’GUNN (CONTD)
Seems that when it rains it pours
my Morton Salt Girl

YOUNG LATINO WOMAN
(in Spanish English
subtitles)
Like cats and dogs my romantic
scoundrel

Led Zeppelin’s cock rock epic “The Rover” starts blaring

O’GUNN grabs the YOUNG LATINO WOMAN’s hair with his free hand
and pulls her lips in for a violent kiss They start necking
hot and heavy Necking soon turns into groping Groping
shortly turns into 0’GUNN taking her right there in the
crowded office building He slides up her skirt she wraps
her legs around him bracing herself against anything she
can But the only thing to hold onto is O’GUNN Finally
O’GUNN throws her on top of a desk

CUT TO

EXT BUNGALOW WEST HOLLYWOOD - THE NEXT MORNING

BULLETT pulls up to a little bungalow in West Hollywood He
gets out of his car and goes to the front door

In a few seconds the door opens and we see none other than
the YOUNG LATINO WOMAN from the previous scene She’s now in
a robe

YOUNG LATINO WOMAN
Buenos dias brother
(gives BULLETT a peck on
the cheek)
To what do I owe the intrusion

BULLETT

It’sit’s this Scottish cop Ive
been working with He took my guns
and left me to die with the sex
animals And now he’s disappeared
These last couple days have been
the big time ass pain

TRACK the glass as it is lifted up and tilted We focus on
the girlish lips behind the glass LOVEJOY’s LIPS

It tastes like a forgotten
bookstore on an overcast day or the
air after your lover says goodbye
(tilting the glass)
A fine year

We PULL BACK to see LOVEJOY in a large opulent solarium In
the center of the solarium is a marble fountain In the
center of the fountain is a statue of a LITTLE BOY A sheet
of water pours from the boys’ eyes to give the impression of
superhuman crying

Stationed around the solarium are NINJAS standing perfectly
still

LOVEJOY walks slowly around NATALYA and EMMA at his side

GODFREE LOVEJOY

From inside his jacket he pulls out an albino peacock
feather He lightly touches the feather to the water and an
image shimmers in the water We see it is DAGGER NAILS

high in the Hollywood Hills It looks like the Playboy
Mansion if the Playboy Mansion was the Hustler Mansion

Digital cameras and lighting sets are littered throughout the
grounds

O‘GUNN crashes BULLETT’s new state-issue Taurus into the side
of the Porn-O-Porium as Van Halens “Unchained” plays

O’GUNN gets out slamming the car door hard BULLETT gets out
with an irked expression Then his eyes bug out as he sees
the following On the front lawn of the mansion are several
big breasted beautiful blonde pornstars They‘re all naked
And they’re all cowering against a 13 year old boy (ARTHUR
FRANKEL) ARTHUR has shaggy hair wears a satin smoking
jacket and puffs on a pipe Adjacent to this spectacle is
police tapethe bomb squad media (the cameramen getting more
pictures of the girls than the mansion that’s taped off due
to a bomb being inside)

smirk

Goddamn my moral compass I can’t
fingerfuck the nasties here while

Mrs O’Gunn would have my ass
handed to me with 57 sauce if I did
otherwise

You are right O’Gunn I shall go

shouldnt be left behind Not one

titted lasses need help too You
defuse the bomb here and then nail
as many of these sperm-toilets as
humanly possible Ill defuse the
kid bomb perhaps nail a sexy 20

jumps back into BULLETT’s car He then pulls out of the

then turns back to the lawn He straightens himself and walks

They run on top of four BOYS’ backs and use them as a spring
board They fly fiercely towards O’GUNN He pivots and swats
three of them away but is SLICED ON THE CHEEK by the fourth

O’GUNN raises his hand to his face sees the blood then looks
down One of the little bastards took his gun and is pointing
it at him

Without thinking O’GUNN rears back and kicks the child in his
child balls The kid goes flying like a goddamn football and
crashes into more children

A NINJA leaps and rolls and throws a ninja-star at O’GUNN
O’GUNN gets out of the way but sees that the star is going to
hit a child in the face Fuck They may be terrorist tots
but they’re under mind control They don’t deserve to die
O’GUNN shoots his hand out and the star buries deep into it
The CHILD is saved but O’GUNN is down one hand

NATALYA sees this and gets an idea
NATALYA
Change of plan ninjas Aim for the
children

ALL CHILDREN
What the fuck11

The NINJAS unleash a hail of stars O’GUNN must run leap and
tumble towards the stars so they don’t hit their marks He
shoots some of the stars out of mid-air in unbelievable
hardboiled marksmanship The stars that he cannot stop he
lets bury into his body

O’GUNN can’t keep this up forever He needs to get rid of
these mind-controlled terrors now before he dies saving them

As O’GUNN continues to stop stars from hitting children he
also grabs each saved child by the hair and with enormous
hardboiled cop strength tosses them out one of the gym’s high
windows We CUT OUTSIDE to follow each child thrown and see
that they land on either a discarded mattress a cart of
grapes or a bale of hay etc

When the last of the CHILDREN are thrown from harm’s way
O’GUNN must now contend with the NINJAS He groans takes a
deep breath and then starts running absurdly in a ridiculous
pattern that makes no sense

The NINJAS all meander about trying to get a bead on O’GUNN
so they can throw more stars at him

NATALYA observes O’GUNN’s ridiculous running and laughs
NATALYA
What are you doing cop Are you
drunk
O’GUNN stops running on a dime and turns around
We ZOOM IN on his sweaty blood-flecked face

O’ GUNN
I’m drunk all right

We ZOOM OUT to see all the NINJAS lined up in a row This was
OGUNN’s plan all along

O’GUNN draws his gun and fires a single shot

We FOLLOW the bullet as it blasts through every NINJA’s head
in a straight line The NINJAS all drop dead like ninja-
garbed dominos

O’ GUNN
(smirking turning to

NATALYA)
Drunk on ninja murder

O’GUNN then does a double-take NATALYA is gone

O’GUNN scowls He then looks down at his multiple and very
bloody ninja-star wounds He waves them off with a dismissive
hand gesture

EXT ARTHUR’S PORN-O-PORIUM - MINUTES LATER

terrible experiment involving gorillas and whiskey Blood and
clumps of ape hair are everywhere ARTHUR and some pornstars
are huddled in a corner BULLETT looks like beat up shit On
the ground the SILVERBACK is bloodied and unconscious The
bomb is still on his chest and BULLETT is trying to defuse
it He’s surrounded by police and members of the bomb squad
They’re all looking at BULLETT with hanging expressions The
bomb is counting down and we can see by the digital numbers
that there’s only 20 seconds to ka-boom

BULLETT starts sweating profusely as he hovers a tiny pair of
pliers over a green wireor is it the red wire BULLETT
grits his teeth in tension-filled anguish Only 15 seconds
how

BULLETT sighs the sigh of a man that is about to explode It
looks like he’s about to go with the red wire but then he
hovers the pliers over the green wire again 10 seconds left
Which wire should BULLETT clip 5 seconds Which fucking

etc) LOVEJOY hands a nearby ninja his bags

The ninja exits as NATALYA enters She places her coat on a

You did not specify Had I known I
would have distracted the Gunn for

O’GUNN and BULLETT sit across from one another at MARGARITAs
kitchen table BULLETT appears to be bottling up much anger
as MARGARITA serves O’GUNN breakfast like a king The
breakfast she serves is of a spicy Mexican variety O’GUNN is
also alternating between drinking a black coffee a bottle of
tequila and a Corona as a chaser As always O’GUNN eats like
an uncultured animal He starts laughing violently Food and
drink flies out of his mouth and he pounds the table with his
fist as he laughs

OGUNN
(to BULLETT collecting
himself)
My apologies Bullett I just
thought of you with a big clown bow-
tie

BULLETT
What

O‘GUNN
A big clown bow-tie You know the
kind with the polka-dots It was a
funny mental picture You with the

me The other tip can be for you
Let it never be said that Charlie
O’Gunn isn’t a fair and balanced
mofo

BULLETT

Stop stop stop

(stops walking and runs

his fingers manically

through his hair)
These “hot tips” of yoursthey
drive me the batshit You hear me

O’ GUNN
Oh Look who went and grew himself

four balls Bullett And you know
what they say Six balls are a
crowd

BULLETT
No more of your insanity No more
of the Madness I’m filing an
official complaint O’Gunn I’m
serious

0’ GUNN

I know you are laddie I’m serious
too Serious about stopping an
international terrorist before he
spills the blood of any more
innocents

(sighs and looks away

soberly as if envisioning

the blood of innocents

being spilt)
There might be madness to my
methods but it’s only because I’m
up against a madman like Lovejoy
You have to trust me Bullett My
heart is in the right place And so
are my guts And my guts are
telling me these latest hot tips
are legit Hopefully you’re also
legit

(turns to BULLETT with

fire in his eyes)
Too legit to quit

O’GUNN makes a fist and extends his knuckles to BULLETT
After a moment of hesitation BULLETT punches it in

BULLETT
(in Spanish English

O GUNN

I don’t speak peasant Bullett
(chuckles)

Which is funny ‘cause every time I
make your kid sister cum she yells
out in her native tongue Fucked if
I know whats she saying

WIPE TO

INT BULLETT’S CAR — MINUTES LATER

As always O’GUNN behind the wheel BULLETT in the passenger
seat

O’GUNN

Hope you like spontaneous under-
cover work Bullett These two hot
tips require that we infiltrate the
underbellies of society I‘m not
gonna lie to you It ain‘t easy
Mrs O’Gunn hates it when I have to
go deep undercover There she is
my good lass of a wife keeping up
the homestead tending to the
livestock baking the Shepard’s
Piesshe’s not the most handsome
of women She’s quite plain if you
must know But without her Charlie
O’Gunn would have no place to call
“home”

(begins to tear up)
I think I’m gonna cry now Bullett
Oh yes Here comes those world
weary waterworks It’s okay to cry
sometimes Really You should try
it

(looks at BULLETT with a

cold murderous face)
I mean it Cry or I‘11 shoot you in
your “big tough guy that won’t cry”
face

BULLETT
Ummm
(shifts uncomfortably in

Championship of Cockfighting
Dagger’s looking to bag some cocks
for his Literally Cock Hungry

(glares ahead at the road)
Little does Dagger know his goose
will be cooked before his cock is
bought

BULLETT
And the other underbelly

O’GUNN

It’ll be your job pilgrim to pump

O’ GUNN

(rubs chin as he muses)
I never masqueraded as a Mexican
before Should be fun

(turns to BULLETT)
How’s your Scottish

BULLETT
Don‘t you think it should be the
other way around

O’ GUNN
(truly perplexed)
What do you ever mean

BULLETT
Don’t you think I should be the
Mexican and you should be the
Scotsman Your way doesn’t make any
sense

O’GUNN
Logic doesn’t have to make sense
That’s a science fact

O‘GUNN leans over and opens up the glove compartment

OGUNN (CONTD)
(pointing to items inside
the compartment)
There you go laddie A couple
items to help you blend in at the
ceremony

BULLETT removes a bottle of scotch and a kilt

BULLETT
(looking down at the kilt)

O’GUNN
Thats not to wear It’s for you to
throw up on

O’GUNN throws up on the kilt

INT UNDERGROUND COCKFIGHTING ARENA - LATER THAT DAY

O’GUNN walks down a long dark hallway His disguise is a
sombrero and a I HEART TIJUANA T-shirt On the walls of this
hallway are framed pictures of ROOSTERS A little plaque
beneath each picture lists the rooster’s name as well as date
of birth and date of death We see names like Razor Beak”
and “Terror Talon”

At the end of the hallway is a small door The door opens to
reveal a GIGANTIC CIRCULAR ARENA We see scores of Mexican
men clutching fistfuls of dollars and bottles of Corona
There are several small fighting areas in the arena

We see roosters with razors attached to their claws and we
also see that these roosters have TRAINERS They rub down the
roosters apply end-swell and pour water over them We CUT to
one rooster with a swollen eye EL DIABLO being worked over
by his cornermen

TRAINER
(Spanish English
subtitles)
Go out there and murder ‘em And
remember Carlos loves ya

O’GUNN scans the crowd There is no sign of DAGGER NAILS

O’GUNN
(suspicion creeping in)
Waitaminute Why would my hot tip
send me to a place full of cocks
and no pussy

We see a corner of the arena where DAGGER NAILS grins evilly

0’ GUNN
It’s a trap

DAGGER nods to a couple of STRONG-ARM MEXICANS who charge
O‘GUNN

Los Lobos‘ “Mas Y Mas” starts rocking

O‘GUNN leaps over the STRONG-ARM MEXICANS and into one of the
fighting areas Two ROOSTERS leap at O’GUNN He somersault
backwards and as the ROOSTERS are about to land he violently
swings his fists upward impaling the ROOSTER’s on his hands
HOLYFUCKINGSHIT O GUNN just fisted two roosters and now hes
wearing them like gloves The ROOSTERS are in excruciating
pain and they kick their razored feet at highspeed

O‘ GUNN
(screaming to the heavens)
I‘VE GOT COCK HANDS 1

Like some kind of drunken Wolverine or ambidextrous Freddy
Krueger O’GUNN whirls through the STRONG-ARM MEXICANS
slicing and dicing O‘GUNN fucks them up and then scans the
crowd

and spots DAGGER NAILS running out of the ARENA

Thunderbird convertible He PEELS off in a fury of smoke and
speed

are torn and he is splattered with blood He still has the
ROOSTERS on

OGUNN sees DAGGER driving away in the distance He then sees

trucks that brings lunch to work sites) O’GUNN flings the
roosters off his hands and the sombrero off his head

We see DAGGER speed past the church

A moment later we see O’GUNN speed past the church

We linger on the church

We then hear an engine It grows louder and louder and louder
until we see O’GUNN driving in reverse at highspeed and
plowing through the front door of the church

slaughterhouse DEAD MEN IN KILTS lie on the floor machine—
guns strapped to their chest Along with the MEN IN KILTS are
also DEAD ASIAN GANGSTERS Bullet holes are everywhere A
small fire burns in a corner O’GUNN turns to the altar

At the altar we see a priest holding a bible We also see a
BEAUTIFUL REDHEAD SCOTSWOMAN She holds the arm of BULLETT
BULLETT is beat-up and bloody His clothes are ripped In one
hand he holds his gun smoke drifts upwards from the barrel
In the other hand is a bottle of scotch BULLETT is drunk

BULLETT

The lunch truck finally gets right behind the Thunderbird
DAGGER flips off O’GUNN and jumps off the Thunderbird and
onto another car O’GUNN frowns and jumps onto the
Thunderbird’s roof where the timebomb is

The drawbridge goes higher and higher BULLETT crashes into
the car DAGGER NAILS has jumped onto This causes DAGGER to
fall off the car and then bridge Then all the cars except
the Thunderbird start sliding backward down the opening
drawbridge

The runaway Thunderbird going faster than the other cars
has managed to defy gravity and races to the top of the
drawbridge While this is happening O’GUNN tries desperately
to defuse the timebomb strapped to its roof He pulls out
wires haphazardly punches the timebomb slaps it barks at
the bomb with a stream of obscenities then shoots a few
rounds at it but nothing works

Right as the Thunderbird overleaps the open part of the
drawbridge O’GUNN picks up the timebomb and tosses it into
the river

Oh Ill restrain myself

O’GUNN lifts up THE CHIEF’s desk and throws it across the
room with a savage battle cry There’s an awkward moment of
silence as O’GUNN BULLETT and CHIEF ANGSTROM look at the
thrown desk Finally O’GUNN reluctantly walks over and picks
up the desk He slowly puts it back in front of THE CHIEF He
even gathers up all the objects that were on top of the desk
and puts them carefully back in place He spends a few
seconds positioning a paperweight O’GUNN then nods with a
workmans pride Then he lifts the desk and throws it across

CUE ”O’GUNN GOES TO A DARK PLACE” MONTAGE

Laura Nyro’s “Captain For Dark Mornings” plays (a moody piano
ballad) as we see the following

1) Various DISSOLVES of O’GUNN walking up a dark lonely
street in a bad part of town When O’GUNN reaches the
foreground he looks around with a “what a fucking shithole”
expression

2) O’GUNN in a motel room at night with a flashing red light
out the window (we see part of a red neon sign revealing
only the word “SIN”) O’GUNN sits on a ratty looking
mattress He has a gun in one hand and an open Bible in the
other We see him mouthing words as he intensely reads from
the Bible

3) A MEDIUM-SHOT of a crazy-eyed O’GUNN with swirling white
lights around him

4) O’GUNN sitting on a seesaw at night in a deserted park
he drinks from a bottle in a brown bag and looks like Jethro
Tull’s Aqualung

5) O’GUNN with TWO CALL GIRLS on his arms exiting a ritzy
looking hotel barricaded with police tape O’GUNN smirks with
wrongdoing

6) O‘GUNN insanely happy in red light laughing
diabolically

7) O’GUNN a total wreck in blue light sobbing
uncontrollably

8) We see a YOUNG ATTRACTIVE REDHEAD lying naked back down
on OGUNN’s ratty motel mattress She has a devilish grin on
her face The CAMERA PANS OVER to O’GUNN and a SMALL MEXICAN
MAN standing before the bed The SMALL MEXICAN MAN is
struggling with a small THRESHER SHARK he’s cradling O’GUNN
points from the SHARK to the REDHEAD and then nods

9) TWO NUNS walk down a street Suddenly a STREAM OF PISS
hits them They both look up in distress and anger We see
that O’GUNN is standing on top of a cathedral naked and
laughing wickedly He then does a mad little dance next to a
gargoyle grotesque

10) O’GUNN in his motel room at night with a flashing blue
light out the window (we see part of a blue neon sign
revealing only the word “SAVE”) He’s staring out the window
and we see his cold blank face in the reflection with the
neon sign

obvious Charlie O’Gunn

O’ GUNN

Who said that

O’GUNN (V0)
Don‘t you recognize your own voice

O’ GUNN
I recognize nothing

O’GUNN rips out his two guns and starts firing away at
nothing

The OGUNN voice in his head laughs manically

O’GUNN (V0)
You can’t shoot your demons

O‘GUNN looks down at his guns then at THE IGUANA and then up
at the sun Finally he nods with a look of some kind of
understanding

Get it together Charlie Get it

O’GUNN slaps himself again harder than before This seems to
have done the trick He looks at his reflection and likes
what he sees He smiles and cracks his neck

O’‘GUNN
Well thank Christ that’s over

We hear a KNOCKING at the door

O’GUNN with a renew hop in his step walks over to the door

and opens it to BULLETT He looks more rough-—around-the-edges
than before

BULLETT
Are you done with the dark place

O’GUNN and BULLETT staked out by some crates BULLETT is
looking through binoculars and is dressed in a black jumpsuit

old fashioned pipe

BULLETT
There is something nefarious going
on But
(presses eyes closer to
binoculars)
Still no Lovejoy

O’GUNN
Hmm

OGUNN seems to daze off lost in his own world After a few
seconds he looks at the vigilant BULLETT and opens his mouth
as if to say something He looks away Then O’GUNN faces
BULLETT again

O’GUNN (CONT’D)
I’ve got to tell you something

O‘ GUNN

I can’t count past two It’s one

BULLETT
How long have you had this problem

O’ GUNN
Two years

BULLETT looks like he’s about to say “What” again but then a
giant shadow falls on them O’GUNN and BULLETT look up and
see a TALL ALBINO HENCHMAN looming down on them with a cold
evil look

BULLETT goes for his gun but O’GUNN gestures for him not to

O‘GUNN

(politely to THE ALBINO

HENCHMAN )
Hello albino My name is Charlie
O’Gunn And I‘ve done a lot of
growing in the past few days For
example I now recognize that not
all albinos are evil That’s right
Your freakish kind are not unlike
human-beings in many ways Hell
you stand upright on two legs

that doesn’t evoke kinship I don’t

BULLETT begins weeping The water rises higher and higher

O’GUNN

But maybe O’Gunn can

O‘GUNN grabs a length of chain in his hands

O’GUNN wrangles the chains banging them against the wall of
the crate He punches the chains He bites the chains

O’GUNN (CONTD)

Again we see O’GUNN go apeshit on the chains

O’GUNN (CONT’D)
No one makes Bullett cry but me

The water is up to their necks

With a superhuman display of hardboiled cop strength 0GUNN
breaks the padlock on the chains and punches loose the top of
the crate

BULLETT’s face goes from despair to elation He goes to push
open the crate but then he sees that O’GUNN isn’t moving
anymore

BULLETT
Come on

No Bullett A captain goes down
with his ship

BULLETT

“What” indeed laddie “What”

The water rises above O’GUNN head

BULLETT busts out of the crate into the ocean He turns back
and reaches for O’GUNN in the crate But O’GUNN refuses his
hand BULLETT tries again O‘GUNN again refuses Finally the
crate sinks into the murky depths We see the haunting image
of a blue—faced OGUNN going down in his watery casket

EXT CEMETARY SOMETIME LATER

We look directly down from some height upon a burial service
The CAMERA rotates slowly in a clockwise fashion as we come
down on the coffin The Scottish flag is draped over it We
hear a PRIEST as the CAMERA PANS AROUND to the mourners

PRIEST “And oh the devil did come to our
Lord and saviour and offer unto him
all the pleasures of the material
world And the lamb of God he did
say unto the Prince Of Darkness
‘Don’t You Fucking Look At Me’ And
oh how the devil did tremble and
shit himself”

The mourners are largely comprised of HARDBOILED COPS from
all over the world Lot’s of Tommy Lee Jones looking hard-
faced motherfuckers There’s a HARDBOILED HONG KONG COP (very
Chow Yun Fat-ish) with sunglasses and a toothpick Theres a
HARDBOILED LATINO COP with a moustache pock marks and a
scowl There’s one cop dressed like Popeye Doyle with the
porkpie hat There’s another cop dressed like Stallone’s
Cobra with the leather jacket sunglasses and tooth pick
(Note The world has probably never seen so many toothpicks
in one location) There’s also a HARDBOILED POLICE DOG And
DAVID CARUSO is there He looks pretty pissed off too

Finally the CAMERA focuses on a mourning BULLETT (CHIEF
ANGSTROM and MARGARITA on either side of him)

We CUT TO the PRIEST standing by the coffin

PRIEST
“and lo did the devil get fucked
the fuck up” Amen

MOURNERS
Amen

PRIEST
And now the chairman of the
Federation of Hard-Boiled Police
Officers would like to say a few
words

A Harvey Keitel Bad Lieutenant type with a butterscotch
leather jacket takes the PRIEST’s place by the coffin This
is the chairman of the Federation of Hard-Boiled Police
Officers (F0HBPO)

F0OHBPO CHAIRMAN
Charlie O’Gunnhe was the best of
us The friggin’ best As hard-
boiled cops we gotta put up with a -
bunch of shit and so we have to
break the rules I know that half
of you had your badges taken away
recently

© Numerous HARDBOILED COPS nod and mummer in agreement

FOHBPO CHAIRMAN (CONT’D)
-eAnd the other half just recently
got their badges back

Numerous HARDBOILED COPS nod and mummer in agreement

F0HBPO CHAIRMAN (‘CONT’D)
But I don’t think there was a hard-
boiled cop that got his badge taken
away and returned to him more times
than Charlie O’Gunn He did more
than break the rules He raped the
rules He cornered the rules ina
dark alley and said “Hey rules
I’m totally gonna fuck you against
your will” And the rules shouted
Im sorry I don’t think I’d like
that” And he yelled back “Put
down that fucking whistle or I’11
give you something to be sorry
about”

The F0HBPO CHAIRMAN’s voice fades to the background as
BULLETT notices a HOT YOUNG WOMAN (20s) making her way
through the opposite side of mourners She’s a Lindsay Lohan

“party girl” type decked out in high-heels hot pants a
cheetah tank top and large gaudy sunglasses She’s got a
pink cell-phone pressed to her ear as she reaches the front
row of mourners

BULLETT

ANGSTROM)

Whos that

CHIEF ANGSTROM

BULLETT
Who’s wife

CHIEF ANGSTROM

MRS OGUNN

husband Charlie Yeah He died It
sucks The sex was un-fucking-—
believable

One of the HARDBOILED COPS tells her to “Shhh” MRS O’GUNN
flashes him a “whatever” look and flips him the bird

FOHBPO CHAIRMAN
»and then the rules wind up
having to spend thousands of
dollars on psychiatric counseling
and wake up in the middle of every
night in a cold sweat and have some
serious issues ever trusting
another man again Maybe the rules
become a lesbian or something
Whatever Fuck the rules The point
is Charlie O’Gunn always got the
job done

O’GUNN scans this realm of whiteness He soon spots a BLACK
SHAPE in the distance O’GUNN squints his eyes at this
indiscernible dark smudge We do several JUMP-CUTS between
O’GUNN and the BLACK SHAPE With each JUMP-CUT the BLACK
SHAPE gets closer and closer until we see that it’s none
other than DEATH (the Grim Reaper version with the hood
sickle etc)

O’GUNN frowns pulis out his two guns and starts shooting at
DEATH

DEATH is unaffected by the shots

DEATH
(in a calm cerebral
voice)
Play

DEATH waves his skeletal hand
Suddenly there’s a CHESSBOARD and two chairs between them

O’‘GUNN nods puts away his two guns and takes a seat at the
CHESSBOARD

DEATH takes his seat and after some deathly contemplation
moves a pawn

O’GUNN studies the position of Death’s pawn O’GUNN rubs his
chin as he muses He lifts a hand over one of his pawns but
then retracts it He rubs his chin again He lifts his hand
over a different pawn but again retracts it He shifts in his
seat He taps a finger on the board He cracks his neck
Finally he raises his hand again and it looks like he’s
gonna move a pawn

But OGUNN quickly grabs DEATH and delivers an across the
chessboard headbutt to the dark spectre DEATH falls back

O’GUNN is smashed in the head by a high-heeled boot

O’ GUNN
Argh My balls

He backhands the attacker the boot flies into the air
spinning he catches the boot as it falls and whips it at an
attacking stripper As she falls in front of him he grabs
her bra yanks it off and in one smooth motion wraps it
around the eyes of an attacking FAT LESBIAN He kicks a leg
up over her back and rides her like a horse holding onto the
bra like a reign The FAT LESBIAN runs about wildly crashing
into other attackers

BULLETT dodges a lesbian attacking him but as she rolls
across his back he grabs her arms and then spins around
using her as a weapon against other attackers

O’GUNN’s FAT LESBIAN begins to buck like a horse
BULLETT stops spinning and then stares dead ahead of him

We PAN to a corner of the strip club to see a dozen hard-—
bodied women wielding nunchucks and katanas They wear black
masks over their faces

GRAPHIC Five Minutes forty-three seconds and a half-bottle
of scotch later

O’GUNN and BULLETT walk out of the club Their clothes are
torn and O’GUNN picks ninja stars out of his hide BULLETT
seems elated and full of life

BULLETT
You know something Charlie I have
to tell you this There was
something very liberating about
kicking all of that woman ass in
there You know Just hauling off
and slapping them and knowing that
you can get away with it because
they were mind-controlled I
feelI feel alive

O’ GUNN
(glaring at BULLETT)
No one likes a misogynist Bullett

BULLETT
But But you were doing the hitting
too

0’ GUNN
Yes But I was crying on the

O’GUNN and BULLETT swing their heads to see EMMA She’s now
got NATALYA on a leash EMMA beams triumphantly O’GUNN and
BULLETT smile

O’GUNN
(walking cockily over to
NATALYA)
Looks like it’s time to question
your brains out Miss Natalya
Nikolyaviech

NATALYA spits on O’GUNN’s face

NATALYA

(glaring at O’GUNN)
You think you will pump my Grade A
thighs for information O’Gunn but

O‘GUNN
(eyes not leaving NATALYA)

EMMA yanks NATALYA over and gives her a steamy as fuck kiss

O’ GUNN
Good girl Now give Uncle Charlie a
kiss

EMMA plants an equally steamy as all fuck kiss on O’GUNN
BULLETT’s jaw drops open

seductive whisper)

INT LAMBOURGHINI — NEXT DAY

O’GUNN and BULLETT drive in silence O’GUNN has a slight
smile on his face BULLETT is in the passenger seat He is
broody and miserable They drive in silence Long BEAT

O’GUNN looks in the rearview mirror at his face

O’GUNN
Handkerchief

BULLETT sullenly reaches into his jacket and hands OGUNN the
cloth O’GUNN dabs at the side of his face while looking in
the mirror and hands the handkerchief back to BULLETT

O’GUNN
Had some lipstick on my face

BULLETT
YOU SON OF A BITCH

0’ GUNN
Goddammit What’s pissing in your
sangria now Your silence hasn‘t
shut up this entire drive Out with
it

BULLETT
I tell you what is pissing in my
sangria Last night Last night
with the two ladies You had them
both I had nothing

O’GUNN
Where are you going with this
Bullett

BULLETT

There were two of them

0’ GUNN
genuinely perplexed)
But there was only one of me
laddie

BULLETT
You had the chance They would have
done anything you said You could
have given me something

0’ GUNN
Now let’s be fair I did give you
that Maxim magazine with Eva
Longoria on the cover and told you
to wait in the bathroom

BULLETT
I can‘t believe you would do that
to me You don’t know what it’s
like O’Gunn

O’ GUNN
What “what’s like

BULLETT
I am greatly hard-up I haven’t had
the sex in two years

O‘GUNN stares at BULLETT as if he has a toaster for a head
And then turns his attention back to the road

O’GUNN
You‘re right I have no idea what
that’s like

BULLETT
And you just let me sit in there
with that magazine while you were
out there groaning and moaning in a
sea of lady skin And I turned the
pages andmy dick it looks at me
with contempt and fear Like a dog
beaten one too many times It
stares up at me and trembles I
fear I have masturbated so much
that it has made my brain slow and
sluggish

0‘ GUNN
Ha You’re a masturbatard

BULLETT begins to weep Angrily weeps He weeps with anger

O’GUNN (CONT’D)
And you’re taking business
personally Last night might have
been a oncein-a-lifetime moment of
outrageous sexual ecstasy the likes
of which no human being will ever
experience againbut it was all
to get this

O’GUNN pulls out a Map Quest printout with directions It
reads “To Lovejoy’s Hideout”

O’GUNN
(chipper)
Oh Here we arel
(turns to BULLETT)
Bullett Crack open your door a
bit

BULLETT reluctantly pulls the door handle and cracks open the
door a bit

OGUNN then turns in his seat and violently kicks BULLETT out
of the car

Then O’GUNN leaps out of the car himself

CUT TO

EXT LAMBOURGHINI - CONTINUOUS

The Lamborghini speeds ahead driver-less hits a Campbells
soup can and then the car is sent flying and spinning into
the air It lands in a body of water sinks and then
explodes

CUT TO

EXT UNSPECIFIED LAND BY UNSPECIFIED WATER -— CONTINUOUS
O’GUNN and BULLETT step out of a mass of smoke and mist

We PAN around behind our two heroes to reveal the large body
of water the car has sunk in There is a dock with a boat
tied to it In the center of this body of water we see
LOVEJOY’s HIDEOUT it is a rocky island dominated by a large
castlechateau that appears as if it could be owned by the
French Sun King Louie The Crazy

BULLETT doesn’t even have the energy to yell at O’GUNN for
kicking him out of the car He’s too pissed to even protest

O’GUNN steps up to the water and surveys the Island A smile
crosses his face he’s about to get his man

Just then we hear the whirling blades of a helicopter O’GUNN
looks up and sees that a black and neon-green helicopter is
making a descent on a helipad located next to the chateau

Just as the helicopter touches down with keen hardboiled cop
eyes O’GUNN sees a group of ninjas forcibly remove MRS
O’GUNN from the vehicle Her hands and feet are bound but she
still chats away on a bluetooth earpiece

We see anxiety and uncertainty cross O’GUNN’s face for the
first time He looks at the WATER and then he looks at the
BOAT and furrows his brow He looks one way down the
shoreline and sees a jet-ski His eyes light up until he sees
an “out-of-order” sign posted on it He frowns and looks down
the other way He sees a small stand offering HELICOPTER
rides for 25 and his eyes light up Then he sees a sign that
says “out to lunch”

O’GUNN’s vision pans wildly around but the only mode of
transportation seems to be the small BOAT

O’GUNN
A boat Why did it have to be a
boat

cUT TO

EXT BODY OF WATER - MOMENTS LATER

O’GUNN and BULLETT speed across the water BULLETT mans the
controls and glares ahead as waterspray dots his face O’GUNN
is hunched on the floor sitting cross-legged His arms
tightly wrapped around himself rage in his eyes

0’ GUNN
Someones going to die for this

WIPE TO

EXT LOVEJOY’S ISLAND - MINUTES LATER

The BOAT comes ashore O’GUNN and BULLETT step out They make
their way inland to the grounds of LOVEJOY’s chateau Placed
all around the grounds are marble statues of greek gods and
goddesses These statues have been painted in bright
psychedelic colors

O’GUNN and BULLETT carefully navigate their way up to the
chateau and go unnoticed by NINJA GUARDS stationed outside
They eventually come upon a back door with a sign reading
EXIT ONLY

O’ GUNN
Damnit Exit only What do we do
now

BULLETT

We ignore the sign

O’GUNN
Ohyeah
BULLETT -
(eyeing O’GUNN
skeptically)
You seem uncharacteristically
wary

0’ GUNN

It’s just that
fidgets a bit)

What if I’m not good enough
Bullett What if I’m not good
enough to stop Lovejoy and save the
world The last time I went mano-a-
mano with Lovejoy it resulted ina
theme park full of corpses and
catastrophe

BULLETT
I would like to give you a rousing
speech O’Gunn that rekindles your
warrior soul But I’m still pissed
over you Bogarting those two girls
last night
(shrugs)
Sorry

0’ GUNN

(after a sigh of

resignation)
Oh well I suppose I’1ll just have
to tap into my own inner strength
or something Waitaminute Hold
on

(squints his face like

he’s passing a kidney

stone and then smiles

broadly)
There we go I believe in myself
again I’m gonna bring the ruckus
to Lovejoy I’m gonna fuck his shit
up so hard he wont be able to
drink a milkshake let alone destroy
the sun

BULLETT
(contemptuously dry)
Yay

O‘GUNN opens the back door and then turns to BULLETT

O’GUNN -
You save my wife Bullett Ir’11

LOVEJOY stands in the middle of a very large room with a hole
in the ceiling Below this hole is the LANCE BIXBY TELESCOPE
looking all sci-fi and threatening after being weaponized
There is a digital countdown clock attached to the telescope
It reads “10 Minutes”

Around LOVEJOY and the telescope are assembled some weird-ass
looking fucks Much like O’GUNN has contemporaries in the
Fraternal Order Of Hardboiled Police Officers LOVEJOY also
has contemporaries in the community of outlandish terrorists
These terrorists are from every race and walk of life We see
a demonic Fu-Man-Chu looking dude We see a diabolic Indian
gay with a ruby studded turban Etc These terrorists all
stare at LOVEJOY with admiration as they eat and drink

The NINJAS that we’ve seen before are dressed like high-class
waiters in tuxedos They serve hor’douerves on silver trays
The ALBINO HENCHMAN is at a large grand piano playing an
instrumental version of “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me”

LOVEJOY stands proudly by his weapon of sun-destruction

Suddenly everyone’s attention is drawn to a corner of the
room

O‘GUNN strides purposefully into the room Evil-ass scumbags
part for him without quite knowing why O’GUNN makes his way
to LOVEJOY

O’ GUNN
Surprised to see this grizzled mug
Lovejoy

GODFREE LOVEJOY
To tell you the truth O’Gunn I’m
not the slightest bit surprised you
survived

little number that reveals her more-than-ample cleavage

MRS O’GUNN

bit too hard last night when I was
plowing her on your bed

BULLETT

O’GUNN
Oh don’t worry Bullett I made
sure to stain the sheets so you’d
have something to remember the
night by

want to tell you this ButI vi

Mrs O’Gunn I fucked her three
times I know you can’t count that
high but that’s how many times I
did it And I fucked her hard
Charlie I fucked her so very very
hard I thought her eyes were going
to explode with all the fucking I
put in her I did her frontways and
backways and upways and you-won’t-
fucking-believeways And she loved
it She loved every second of it
Charlie So there So there

is a tense silent moment Then O’GUNN turns to BULLETT with
a grin
