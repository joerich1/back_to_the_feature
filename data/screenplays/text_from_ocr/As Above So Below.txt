INT IRANIAN BUS - AFTERNOON
Camera powers up jostles around until it settles on --

The floor of a third world bus Middle Eastern legs
traditional Arabian dresses to the floor homemade bags
animals everywhere A chaotic scene with men women children
all shouting in Farsi Brief glimpses of a mountainous
landscape through the shaky windows This bus could really
use some new shocks and a better muffler

The camera rises turns around revealing its operator a
WOMAN wearing a hajib (a traditional Arabian headdress) She
slumps low in her seat for privacy looks around cautiously
and carefully lowers her veil revealing --

SCARLETT DURANG mid 20s an adventurous British
archaeologist The kind of cat that gets killed by curiosity
Her off-the-charts intellect and multiple post-grad degrees
are barely concealed by her striking good looks and punk rock
inclinations

Judging from the cloth that edges frame she is obviously
shooting with a small camera attached to her hajib

She whispers to the camera - alert but not scared

SCARLETT
I’m approximately 20 miles inside
the Iranian border en route to the
Habala region where they have
ordered the destruction of a
network of caves at sundown
tonight I believe these caves
might contain a critical missing
piece of our history A piece I
can’t let them destroy

She turns the camera back around then pauses and goes back
to her face

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Oh and if I’m found dead please
know I entered the country of my
own free will fully knowing the
penalty for trespassing here is
burial up to your neck in sand and
having a rock wall pushed on top of
you Which you know seems
perfectly appropriate

She grins mischievously
SCARLETT (CONTD)
But they’ll have to catch me first

EXT HABALA PROVINCE - SUNSET

Sun is almost touching the horizon

The camera shakes as Scarlett crosses through a sparsely
populated marketplace as megaphones in the background demand
everyone clear the area

Scarlett is careful to keep pace with REZA a mousy Persian
with a neatly trimmed moustache and a weathered knockoff
Tommy Hilfiger T-shirt He leads her to a small rock hut of
a home

REZA
Hurry Come

INT POOR IRANIAN HOME - SUNSET
The camera follows Reza into a shanty
REZA
If they catch you here it would be

very bad for you

SCARLETT
Yeah I know

Reza nods to his WIFE in traditional garb She nods back and
slides some sooty wooden shelves aside revealing --

A PERSON-SIZED HOLE IN THE FLOOR THAT QUICKLY FADES TO
DARKNESS

Scarlett smiles

She shines her mini flashlight into the hole the ground is
about 10 feet down

She gets ready to climb in

REZA
Wait You’1l need this

Reza grabs a homemade rope ladder that’s tied to the base of
the stove and drops it into the hole
INT HABALA CAVES - SUNSET
Scarlett climbs into the dark cavern

As the camera crosses the threshold it moves into near total
darkness Background sound from the streets above become
faint echoes

Reza drops down right behind her

A grinding sound as Reza’s wife slides the bookshelves back
into place obliterating the light above

Once Scarlett gets her footing she shines her flashlight
down the cave corridor Its long and dark Its about 4 feet
tall forcing Scarlett and Reza into a crouched scamper

REZA
We don’t have much time They have
already cleared the area

They race deeper and deeper into the cave

A MEGAPHONE SQUALL THEY JUMP SOMEONE SPEAKS FARSI INTO A
MEGAPHONE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER -- COMING TOWARD THEM

They race back and take cover behind a rock Scarlett grabs a
rock off the floor in case she needs to use it as a weapon

An ARMED GUARD passes calling instructions out into the
megaphone If he just looks over his shoulder he’1ll see
them But he doesn’t

REZA (CONTD)
We need to leave We’re too late

SCARLETT
They’re not blowing the caves until
sundown right

Scarlett checks her watch

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Should give us a few more minutes

REZA
It’s too risky

SCARLETT
Which way is it I’1ll go without
you

REZA

No
SCARLETT
I’m not leaving

Reza can see she’s not bluffing And she’s not He
reluctantly continues

REZA
Hurry

They race through one last corridor then arrive at their
destination --

REZA (CONTD)
There

Scarlett races to it - a wall full of ancient Coptic
Christian inscriptions

SCARLETT
(whispers)
It’s even more beautiful than the
pictures

She runs her fingers through the grooves as if she’s reading
braille She quietly reads aloud in an ancient tongue

REZA
We must hurry Please

The camera seems to drift down and she resets it a couple
times until--

SCARLETT
How can anyone think straight with
these head covers falling all
over

She anxiously whips the veil off her head and throws it down
on the floor beside her RE-FRAMING THE CAVE IN AN AWKWARD
ANGLE CAPTURING SHE REZA AND THE WALL SIDEWAYS

She continues reading the inscriptions

SCARLETT (CONTD)
There’s more

She looks around frantically grabs a rock off the floor

REZA
We have to go

She hacks away at the inscriptions with the rock chiseling
off chunks of stone with each hit
REZA (CONTD)
What are you doing

SCARLETT
They’re going to blow it up anyway

REZA
They’1ll hear you Stop

A whistle blows in the distance Someone shouts in Farsi

REZA (CONTD)
They’re going to blow it

SCARLETT
I just need a minute

REZA
We don’t have a minute

She analyzes the stone wall Picks a specific spot marked by
an inscribed rose Takes one more hit and THE WHOLE WALL
COLLAPSES TO THE GROUND revealing --

A GIANT STONE STATUE OF A BULL HOLDING A SNAKE IN ITS MOUTH
IT’S FACE IS FIERCE OMINOUS CREEPY AND IT’S COVERED WITH
INSCRIPTIONS
One glance at it and Scarlett knows what it is
SCARLETT
Oh my God Do you know what this

is

It takes her a moment to snap to Reza grabs her and
physically tries to escort her away

REZA
We must go Now

She pushes her way free
SCARLETT
I have been searching for this all

my life Go I’1l catch up

REZA
I’m sorry I have a family

REZA RUNS OFF LEAVING HER ALONE IN THE CAVE

Scarlett whips out a small piece of equipment the size of
remote control from a small satchel hidden under her robes
We hear faint voices on megaphones from down the tunnels
The small scanner hums to life as it emits a solid line of
green light Scarlett begins to methodically blanket the
statue with the laser scanning it for future study

SCARLETT
Come on

The light creates eerie shadows of the statue on vaulted
ceilings of the chamber

She’s painfully slow making sure to get every detail of this
ancient relic The voices from the megaphones are getting
louder and more foreboding

The voice in the megaphone seems to be doing a countdown but
in the foreign language it’s hard to tell which number it’s
down to

Scarlett knows how close she’s cutting this but she won’t
lose this piece of history She continues swiping the green
laser line from the scanner over every side of the bull
She’s done

She grabs her headdress and runs like hell

BOOM

A BLACK DUST CLOUD RUSHES PAST SCARLETT LEAVING HER IN THE
DARK IN THE CAVE SHE COUGHS A COUPLE TIMES BUT CONTINUES

BOOM
ANOTHER BLAST
BOOM

Scarlett keeps racing forward hoping the sounds of
collapsing rock won’t catch her

She slams into something

SCARLETT (CONTD)
REZA REZA

Something moves Sunlight cracks through the dust The rope
ladder drops

Scarlett climbs into the light
INT POOR IRANIAN HOME - SUNDOWN

And back into Reza’s house

She collapses on the ground coughing furiously
She holds up the scanner

SCARLETT
I got it I got it

She keeps coughing as Reza shakes his head

REZA
You remind me so much of your
father But you must be more
careful His quest was a path to
madness

CUT OUT

Note The following Kickstarter video will be more “produced”
than the rest of the film - full of B-Roll even music
glossy - a real presentational video

INT SCARLETT’S OFFICE - UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON

Scarlett now in her “street clothes” has a punk-rock hip
that’s hard to deny She looks directly into the camera and
talks

SCARLETT
Hello Kickstarter My name is
Scarlett Durang and I may have
just discovered the key to immortal
life

INT SCARLETT’S OFFICE - DAY

BENJI DONAGHAN late 20s a friendly slightly heavy red
Irishman The devilish glint in his eyes reminds us of that
rascally friend we all like to drink with when we need a
laugh

BENJI
I’m Benji Donaghan For those of
you who’ve seen my previous
documentaries like LONER or BROTHER
IN ARMS you know I am fascinated
with obsessive personality types

CUT TO
SCARLETT TALKS TO CAMERA

SCARLETT

I’m a professor of archaeology at
University College London I have a
PhD in Egyptology A masters in
chemistry and another PhD in
linguistics I am fluent in four
spoken languages and two dead
ones

(she smiles)
And I’m a blackbelt in Krav Maga

BENJI TALKS TO CAMERA

BENJI
I have yet to see her do anything
Literally anything at all that
isn’t driven by her all-consuming
quest to find the lost knowledge of
the alchemists

BACK TO SCARLETT

SCARLETT
What is alchemy

She smiles This is a big question

A montage of imagery Alchemists arcane symbols
representations of the Philosopher’s Stone and the processes
used to create it play over the following

SCARLETT (VO) (CONTD)
Alchemy was an early form of
science in which the practitioners
attempted to create a mythical
substance known as the
Philosophers Stone which could
turn base metals to gold cure
disease and provide the key to
eternal life

EXT RUE NICOLAS FLAMEL —- DAY
Scarlett points to the house behind her

SCARLETT
600 years ago the greatest of the
alchemists Nicolas Flamel lived
in this house in Paris

(MORE)
SCARLETT (CONTD)
He was widely believed to have
succeeded in developing the
Philosopher’s Stone which would
have given him all the wealth he
could dream of as well as eternal
life

IE MONTAGE
Imagery of Flamel’s life done in the old style of woodcuts

SCARLETT
Though we don’t have definitive
proof of this we do know that he
was a middle class book dealer who
suddenly became one of the
wealthiest men in Paris

Present day footage of buildings his money built

SCARLETT (CONTD)
-donating orphanages and
hospitals all over the city many
of which still stand today

EXT RUE NICOLAS FLAMEL - DAY
Back to Scarlett

SCARLETT
In fact he was so generous with
this money that 600 years later
this street in Paris is still named
after him

The camera pans off her to the sign “Rue Nicolas Flamel”
beside her

EXT FONTAINE DES INNOCENTS - DAY

Scarlett now stands near the Fontaine des Innocents - the
last remnant of Paris’ original cemetery

SCARLETT
We also know that when grave
robbers hoping to get their hands
on the Philosopher’s Stone tried
to dig his body up out of a
cemetery that used to surround this
spot here they found his casket
empty As well as his wife’s

INT MUSEUM - DAY

Scarlett stands in front of an archaeological exhibit ina
Parisian museum

SCARLETT

And we know that 400 years later
an archeologist working for King
Louis XV met an old man in Turkey
who knew things he believed only
Nicolas Flamel could have known He
was convinced to his dying day that
this man had been Flamel himself

INT SCARLETT’S OFFICE - DAY

Again Scarlett sits in her office talking to camera though
she seems uncomfortable with the question asked of her

SCARLETT
I came from a studious
household I guess When I was 7
my mother died suddenly and we
took it really hard My dad dropped
everything to search for the key to
everlasting life And I went with
him Everywhere

CUT TO
Benji speaks to camera

BENJI
Her father was a Nobel Laureate
When he dropped out and went
searching for Nicolas Flamel’s
discovery it was the scandal of
academia Everyone chalked it off
to madness

CUT TO

Scarlett talks

SCARLETT
No he wasn’t crazy He just
believed that some things in this
universe aren’t wired together as
simply as modern science might
suggest

CUT TO

Benji speaks

BENJI
After spending 20 years chasing
clues her father took his own
life

INT MUSEE DE CLUNY - DAY

Scarlett stands in front of a glass case holding a GRAVESTONE
COVERED IN SYMBOLS at the Musee de Cluny

SCARLETT
This was Flamel’s gravestone which
he designed and carved himself

The camera zooms in on it

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Many believe that the clues to the
location of the Philosopher’s Stone
is encoded in these arcane symbols
but its meaning has remained a
mystery until this

She holds up a photograph of the statue she scanned in Iran

SCARLETT (CONTD)
The fabled “Rose Key” a kind of
Rosetta Stone deciphering
alchemical symbols into Aramaic

INT SCARLETT’S OFFICE

BENJI
We are seeking money to both
finance the expedition to find this
mythical stone and for me to shoot
a documentary chronicling
Scarlett’s journey

SCARLETT
Let us conquer death together

CUT TO

INT SCARLETT’S OFFICE - EVENING

Note from this point forward everything will be shown in a
“raw footage” style

The camera powers on settling on Scarlett at the computer
This lacks all the polish displayed in the promo video This
is the beginning of the documentary footage

Scarlett sits at her computer

BENJI (0C)
Hit refresh

She does The camera turns to reveal of 30000 they’re
trying to raise to make their documentary they are 29975
of the way there

SCARLETT
Almost there

BENJI (0C)
Hit it again

SCARLETT
Give it a moment

She can’t wait She hits it

BENJI (0C)
Some moment
29990
SCARLETT
So close
BENJI (0C)

Hit it again Hit it again

SCARLETT
You

He hits it “FUNDED”
Scarlett pops a bottle of champagne pours them each a glass

SCARLETT (CONT’D)
Get on camera

He does They clink glasses

BENJI
How do you feel

SCARLETT
Like it’s time to get to work

She motions to her statue of the Rose Key

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Now all we need is someone who can
read Aramaic
(She smiles wryly)
Good thing I know a guy

EXT RUE DES JARDINS - DAY

Scarlett sees a small crowd gathered on a street watching
GEORGE late 20s handsomely enthusiastic in a bookish way
One look and you know he’s the kind of warm-hearted guy you
could always depend on in a pinch

GEORGE
This is what I love about Paris
You can literally step up to any
corner and there are layers and
layers of history going back
thousands of years Someone name
an era

A couple hands go up George points at one

STUDENT
French Revolution

GEORGE
Oh there’s a good one for that
Look at this street right here In
1795 royalist sympathizers stormed
the streets threatening the
deputies of the National
Convention

Benji walks the camera closer as George talks

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Napoleon Bonaparte recently made
Commander of the Army of the
Interior was asked to stop them
So what does he do He fires
cannons into the crowd Cannons
loaded with pellets so they would
literally decimate hundreds of
people So what do you think the
government did when they found out
You think they reprimanded him Put
him in jail Anything No They
promoted him You do not want to
piss off the French

He looks around at the crowd

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Okay who wants to pick another
era

SCARLETT
The era of Nicolas Flamel

George knows that voice He looks like he’s just been hit by
a 2x4 as he spots Scarlett there listening to him

GEORGE
(to the class)
Give me a moment please

George walks to Scarlett

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Whatever it is I want no part of
it

SCARLETT

You haven’t even heard

GEORGE
I’1l save you the time No

George looks to the camera guy

GEORGE (CONTD)
Who’s this guy

(looks to Benji)
Who are you

SCARLETT
He’s making a film about my search
for
BENJI (0C)
I’m Benji
GEORGE
(to Benji)

Word to the wise walk don’t run
from this one

SCARLETT
You mean run don’t walk

GEORGE
Yeah Shut up
(to Benji)
Did she tell you last time I saw
her I literally wound up ina
Turkish prison

SCARLETT
It was more like a jail than a
prison

George looks at the camera guy and points at her You getting
a load of this

GEORGE
It was jail In Turkey Think she
was there waiting for me when I got
out

SCARLETT
(sheepish)
I couldn’t let the lead go dead

GEORGE
God forbid Well go on chase your
lead See how far that gets you I
have a class to teach

He turns to walk away

SCARLETT
I found the Rose Key

This stops him in his tracks

GEORGE
You did

SCARLETT
Yeah

GEORGE

It was in Iran wasn’t it
(catches himself)

Forget I asked I don’t care
(stops)

It was though wasn’t it

SCARLETT
Yes
GEORGE
I knew it Ha I knew it
SCARLETT
I need your help translating the
Aramaic
GEORGE

Wait Did you go to Iran

SCARLETT
It doesn’t matter who went

GEORGE
You did didn’t you By yourself

SCARLETT
It doesn’t matter who

GEORGE
You are such a lunatic
(to the camera)
She is a total lunatic Be careful
(to Scarlett)
I’1l help translate But that’s it

SCARLETT
Okay

He smiles excited despite himself
GEORGE
(before going)
I knew it would be in Iran
INT GEORGE’S ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORKSHOP - EVENING
George and Scarlett look over a small model replica of the
statue she found in Iran and a large photo printing of

Flamel’s tombstone

Scarlett waits anxiously as George analyzes the symbols
writes as he goes

The room is full of artifacts mud microscopes All bones
and clay and dirt All function no form Completely lacking
a woman’s touch

SCARLETT
Almost done

GEORGE
Shh

She paces She’s been waiting for this moment all her life
George puts his pen down

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Okay

SCARLETT
What does it say
GEORGE
(oh my God”)
It says the Philosopher’s Stone is
in the Champs Elysee’s Starbucks
bathroom

SCARLETT
Seriously

GEORGE
Okay let me read I think it’s in
couplets so let me try to get the
rhythm right

SCARLETT
Just tell me what
GEORGE
Let me do this right

(reads )
“Winged vulture leads your way
with brightest light in darkest
day

Scarlett sits not sure what this means

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Underneath the heavens reign what
is lost shall be regained when
halfway twixt the darkest gate and
this tablet laid atop this paired

fate

SCARLETT
Parrot

GEORGE
Pair’ed

SCARLETT

Pair’ed You mean paired

GEORGE
Yes But paired doesn’t rhyme

SCARLETT
And it has to rhyme

GEORGE
It rhymed in Aramaic I’m trying to
do justice to the translation

SCARLETT
This tablet You’re sure it said
this tablet

GEORGE
Of course I’m sure

SCARLETT
This tablet The headstone is a
marker

GEORGE
Where it was in a cemetery that no
longer exists

SCARLETT
Yeah “Underneath the heavens
reign what is lost shall be
regained”

GEORGE
“What is lost shall be regained”

SCARLETT
That’s got to be the Philosophers
Stone

GEORGE
Maybe

SCARLETT
“Underneath heaven’s reign”
could be under the night sky

GEORGE
Or under this tombstone It’s got a
night sky right on it

SCARLETT
Yeah

GEORGE
“darkest gate”

SCARLETT
Hell “Darkest gate” The gates of
hell

GEORGE
Okay But that gives us nothing
Halfway between his grave and the
gates of hell

SCARLETT
Wait wait wait

Scarlett rushes to a SMALL NOTEBOOK FULL OF ALCHEMICAL
SYMBOLS AND TEXT It looks like something written by a
madman

GEORGE
What’s that

SCARLETT
My dad’s notebook He left it to
me There was something

She rifles through it finds a page She slams the book down
on the table

George looks at it as the camera looks on It’s a replica of
an arcane drawing of the heavenly bodies above the earth the
ground and hell within But the thing that makes this
interesting the distances are noted

GEORGE
It has the distances they believed
between heaven and earth and hell

SCARLETT
According to the alchemists the
number of the Devil was 741 Makes
sense they would believe hell to be
741 feet beneath the surface of the
earth

GEORGE
So halfway twixt this tablet and

SCARLETT
3705 feet directly beneath his
tombstone is where we’ll find the
Philosopher’s Stone

GEORGE
Feet were a bit shorter back then
More like 108 inches per foot
Won’t be hard to

SCARLETT
How are we going to get 370 feet
into the earth

GEORGE
Scarlett you’re in Paris

She gets his meaning

SCARLETT
The catacombs

BENJI (0C)
What are “the catacombs”

GEORGE
It’s a network of tunnels under the
streets of Paris that spans over
200 miles No nothing

He sees Benji really doesn’t know anything about it so he
goes on

GEORGE (CONTD)
In the 1700s the Cemetaire des
Innocents

SCARLETT
Where the Flamel and his wife were
supposedly buried

GEORGE
Was so full of hundreds of years of
dead bodies that the entire city
stank and people were getting
sick It was disgusting So they
took all the lime quarries under
the city and used them to house the
remains of some 6 million bodies

He lets that sink in

BENJI (0C)
Six million

GEORGE
It’s by far the world’s largest
crypt

SCARLETT
So we might be able to just walk
right on down there

GEORGE
And get your Philosopher’s Stone
Which for the record I don’t
really actually believe in

SCARLETT
You will

EXT FONTAINE DES INNOCENTS - DAY
Scarlett George and Benji stand on a street corner near
where the Flamels were allegedly buried Scarlett refers to
her father’s notebook
SCARLETT

According to Sir Isaac Newton who

was a legendary alchemist Flamel’s

grave was twenty seven paces due

north from the fountain

GEORGE
Let’s walk it out

She paces her steps counting as she goes She waves to
traffic as she walks right through the busy Paris
intersection George shakes his head looks to Benji

She stops Calls back to them

SCARLETT
Right

HOOONNNKK

The camera spins as A CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP RIGHT BESIDE
SCARLETT AND THE CAMERA scaring the shit out of them both

They get out of the street Scarlett takes a breath trying
to play off the adrenalin surging through her veins

SCARLETT (CONTD)
3705 feet below that point
INT ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORKSHOP - NIGHT
Scarlett marks a large map of Paris with a red x

SCARLETT
This is where Flamel’s grave was

George lifts a map of the catacombs printed on transparency
and pins it over the map of Paris

FLAMEL’S GRAVE FALLS IN AN AREA WITHOUT TUNNELS UNDER IT

GEORGE
Shit

SCARLETT
Shit

BENJI
What is it

GEORGE
The catacombs don’t go under
Flamel’s grave

Scarlett takes a step back Thinking

SCARLETT
So what do we do

GEORGE
We There’s no we here I’m helping
with translation That’s it

Scarlett chooses to ignore him

SCARLETT
Maybe we could burrow in through
this tunnel

GEORGE
Burrow in You know how thick these
walls are They’re made of solid
granite and they’ve all been
reinforced since

Something occurs to George
GEORGE (CONT’D)
parts of the city collapsed
into it

George looks like he’s just been struck by lightning

He feverishly grabs a small handful of pins races to the
map

GEORGE (CONT’D)
In 1774 about 100 feet of Avenue
Denfert-Rochereau

He places a pin in the map
GEORGE (CONTD)
Was literally swallowed up into the
ground falling 100 feet into the
earth

He places another pin

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Another collapse happened a few
years later at Barriére dEnfer
Followed by a collapse here at
Avenue des Fontaines

He places a pin right next to the “x” marking Flamel’s grave
Scarlett gets where he’s going with this
SCARLETT
Why would the street collapse if
it’s nothing but solid ground

underneath it

GEORGE
Exactly

SCARLETT
There must be a hidden chamber

GEORGE
It would appear so

SCARLETT
We have to get down there

GEORGE
Again there’s no “we” here
EXT PARIS CATACOMBS OFFICIAL TOUR AREA - DAY
George and Scarlett approach the entrance to the official
tourist area of the catacombs where other tourists wait in
line

Scarlett buys tickets

SCARLETT
Three tickets please

GEORGE
Oh no I’m not going in Just two
tickets

Scarlett shoots George a strange look

SCARLETT
Three

Scarlett buys three tickets despite George’s reservations
GEORGE
I’m serious I’m not going in
there

SCARLETT
Don’t tell me you’re scared of a
little cave

GEORGE
I have a thing

SCARLETT
What kind of thing

GEORGE
I don’t go underground

SCARLETT
You’re an archaeologist

GEORGE
I know But I never go underground

SCARLETT
That’s kind of sad It’s like being
a deaf composer or something

GEORGE

Regardless you’re not getting me
down there

INT PARIS CATACOMBS OFFICIAL TOUR AREA - DAY

Benji films Scarlett following the official tour of THE
CATACOMBS Bones and plaques neatly arranged in a morbid but

antiseptic display

A French tour guide tours the group of Americans and Brits

TOUR GUIDE
By the 1700s residents from all
over Paris were complaining about
the horrible smell of the bodies in
the overcrowded cemetery Something
had to be done Louis the 15th
officially ordered the cemeteries
within city limits closed

Another shot

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
and the remains be brought down
here in the old quarries that had
been used to build the city

BENJI (0C)
This place is creeping me out I
don’t like being in a tomb

Scarlett sees a plaque “Cemetaire des Innocents”
She turns and talks to the camera
SCARLETT
These remains are from the same
cemetery as the Flamels’ graves
Scarlett references her map
SCARLETT (CONTD)
So we’re looking to go about half

a mile right through this wall

As the tour guide continues Scarlett cases the structure
like an inmate looking for weak links in a prison

Scarlett finds a small gap between the walls She looks
around The tour is making a little distance

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I can squeeze through this Wait
for me

She climbs through the gap in the walls and disappears into
the darkness

BENJI
Jesus You kidding me

SCARLETT
(loud whisper)
Shine the light in here

Benji shines a light into the crevasse Nothing

BENJI (0C)
Scarlett

He turns the camera back to the tour still barely out of
sight but coming back

BENJI (0C) (CONT’D)
Scarlett
Nothing

BENJI (0C) (CONTD)
Shit

He leans the camera in closer to get a better look
completely getting unnerved by this whole thing

SCARLETT LUNGES OUT A THE CAMERA

SCARLETT
BAAAH

BENJI JUMPS BACK AWAY FROM THE HOLE DROPPING THE CAMERA

Scarlett finds herself pretty funny

BENJI
You’re going to make me break the
damned camera

SCARLETT
Sorry

TOUR GUIDE

You are not allowed back there
Please get back into the group

INT CATACOMBS TOUR ENTRANCE AREA - DAY

On the way out the TICKET TAKER looks punk rock cool He

smiles to Scarlett She approaches him

SCARLETT
(quietly)
Do you know any way to get into the
private areas of the catacombs

The Ticket Taker looks around sheepishly

TICKET TAKER
No

SCARLETT
Thanks anyway

She notes his Die Antwoord t-shirt
SCARLETT (CONTD)

I saw them in Berlin last April
One of the best nights of my life

EXT CATACOMBS ENTRANCE AREA - DAY
George waits outside

SCARLETT
You missed a nice tour

GEORGE
Good

SCARLETT
I didn’t see anything that could
have

The Ticket Taker hustles to Scarlett He hands her a club
flyer for Club Silencio

TICKET TAKER
Ask for Papillon

SCARLETT
Thanks

She nods to him He nods back and leaves
She holds it up for George to see
SCARLETT (CONTD)
Let’s go find Papillon
EXT CLUB SILENCIO - NIGHT
Scarlett George and Benji get out of a cab

GEORGE
You sure this is the place

SCARLETT
That’s what it says

Nothing from the street would indicate this was a club Just
an average-sized MAN sipping a vodka in front of a
nondescript door

Scarlett leads George to the door The Man stops them Points
to a list

SCARLETT (CONTD)
We’re not on the list

He shrugs his shoulders Not happening

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Were looking for Papillon

MAN
Ah Papillon

Why didnt you say so He opens the door and shows them
inside
INT CLUB SILENCIO - NIGHT

Scarlett George and Benji enter a bizarre Parisian nightclub
that resembles a beautifully designed bunker

The Man points to the back of the room

MAN
Papillon la

SCARLETT
Merci

She leads George and Benji through dancers and lounge-lizards
to some tables in the back

She finds PAPILLON sipping a red drink talking excitedly
with friends

Had he been born half a century ago Papillon surely would
have been a leader of the French Resistance but in these
times must amuse himself with less constructive forms of
rebellion

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Papillon

PAPILLON
Qui 6tes-vous

SCARLETT
I need to get into the catacombs
I’m told you could take me
He laughs

PAPILLON
Do I look like a tour guide to you

SCARLETT
Do I look like a tourist

He smiles Takes a sip of his drink

PAPILLON
Why would I want to bring you down
there

She takes a map of the catacombs out of her pocket and slaps
it onto the table in front of him

SCARLETT
Because we’ve found a secret
passage that nobody knows about

Papillon looks at the markings Shakes his head

PAPILLON
We would have found it if it was
there

SCARLETT

No you wouldn’t have It was
designed to not be seen

PAPILLON
Why would that be
SCARLETT
Because I believe it’s full of

treasure
Papillon laughs Looks to George

PAPILLON
Is she serious

George nods

PAPILLON (CONTD)
Me and my friends can take half
this treasure

SCARLETT
You can have it all That’s not
what we’re looking for

GEORGE
Half is probably fine

PAPILLON
You are a strange girl aren’t you

SCARLETT
You don’t know the half of it

INT PAPILLON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Papillon throws a couple pairs of rubber waders and helmets
to George and Scarlett

PAPILLON
Try these

GEORGE
Oh I’m not going in I’m just here
for support

SCARLETT
He’s coming George I need your
help

GEORGE
This guy seems to know what he’s
doing

SCARLETT
But who knows what we’1ll come
across down there I can’t decipher
it all without you Come on we
were a good team remember

GEORGE
Text it to me and Ill

PAPILLON
No cell phones down there Ground
is too dense

GEORGE
So there’s no way to call for help
if something goes wrong

PAPILLON

GEORGE
Then I’m definitely not going

A knock at the door

PAPILLON
(shouts)
Entrez
(to Scarlett)
My team

In walks ZED a quiet squirrely Frenchman of 25 with large
calves and strong hands A perfectly designed climbing
machine

He’s trailed by SOUXIE a motherly Goth girl She’s the den
mother of the cataphiles
PAPILLON (CONTD)
This is Zed the last letter in

climbing And Souxie The banshee

She sees all the waders and helmets and everything all over
the place

SOUXIE
Ah what a mess Papillon

PAPILLON
She also manages our supplies

Souxie sorts through the supplies

INT PAPILLON’S APARTMENT - LATER
The group stands around a map of the catacombs
PAPILLON

Well enter through the park That
will make it easier to find La

Taupe
SCARLETT
La Taupe
PAPILLON
“The Mole”
SOUXIE
He lives down there
GEORGE
He lives down there
SOUXIE
Oui
GEORGE
Weird

Papillon points to a spot on the map

PAPILLON
He is usually around

SCARLETT
But that’s the wrong direction

PAPILLON
Sometimes going the wrong direction
is the quickest way

SCARLETT
Do we really need this guy We have
maps and

PAPILLON
Oui We need this guy

INT PAPILLON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Souxie counts out all the flashlights clothes etc She
tests each flashlight herself She notices the camera and
talks

SOUXIE
It is dangerous underground If you
run out of batteries and no
flashlight you will die If you
run out of water If you get
hurt

ZED
There are also dangers of cave ins
police rats bats claustrophobia
drowning bugs

SOUXIE
Many things can go wrong down

there We need to plan for them
all There is no room for mistakes

Papillon checks food and water
PAPILLON
And we always bring enough food and

water for a week

GEORGE
A week

Papillon shrugs his shoulders

EXT WOODED AREA - NIGHT

Scarlett and George follow Souxie Papillon and Zed into a
dark wooded area in a park in Paris

Papillon stops them about 50 feet shy of a dirt mound with a
hole in it surrounded by concrete and graffiti The hole
looks more like something a raccoon would live in

He and Zed scan the area for police

PAPILLON
The police hate me here

All clear

EXT CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

They approach the hole A tight fit dropping into darkness
Not something you’d ever want to climb into

GEORGE
Youre going in that Seriously

BENJI
Let’s turn on the cameras

Benji comes around beside Scarlett He turns on the GoPro
attached to her headlamp He makes a dipshit face into the
camera

BENJI (CONTD)
B camera good check

He approaches Zed who also has one on his headlamp Benji
flips it on Makes a dipshit face into camera

BENJI (CONTD)
C camera good check

Benji nods to Papillon Ready

Scarlett hands George a ruck sack

SCARLETT

Here
He looks at it

GEORGE
What’s this

SCARLETT
Your bag

GEORGE

You have some serious listening
skill issues

PAPILLON
Zed Allez

Zed drops through the hole

INT CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Zed climbs swiftly through a jagged shaft of rock to the
floor of the catacombs

ZED
Clear

EXT CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

George and Scarlett continue their discussion

SCARLETT
I need you on this

GEORGE
Scarlett I’m sorry

PAPILLON
Souxie Allez

Souxie disappears through the hole

PAPILLON (CONTD)
(to George)
I don’t care what you do but make

up your mind now

GEORGE
I’m not coming

SCARLETT
He’s coming

BOOM

OUT OF NOWHERE PAPILLON IS TAKEN DOWN RIGHT THROUGH THE
CAMERA FROM AN OPEN FIELD TACKLE BY A PARISIAN POLICEMAN

A whistle blows The camera spins to find a second policeman
running toward them

PAPILLON
Allez Allez Allez

SCARLETT
Sorry George

She jumps through the hole and disappears

George stands there looking at his bag At the hole At the
oncoming policeman

GEORGE
Shit Shit Shit

PAPILLON
Allez Allez

Benji jumps through the hole with the camera followed
closely by George

INT CATACOMBS ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Benji makes his way down though the jagged rocks as Zed
points out the safe places to steps

George appears with ruck sack

GEORGE
You fuckers Shit

Scarlett looks around the catacombs This is much rougher
than the official tourist area but in its way much more
beautiful Paintings and graffiti on the walls give it an
urban cool vibe

SCARLETT
This is beautiful

George looks a bit shell shocked to be down here Scarlett
greets him

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I knew you’d come with us

GEORGE
Yeah thanks

Papillon appears above dropping like a bat into hell He
hits every wall on the way down

PAPILLON
Allez Allez Allez

Papillon digs furiously in his pockets as they race through
the tunnels fleeing from the police

POLICEMAN (0C)
Arret Arret

Papillon lights up a smoke bomb drops it The effect of the
gathering smoke is eerie unsettling

PAPILLON
Careful

Papillon leaps over a two foot hole in the floor Followed by
Scarlett and the rest

He motions into an alcove where they wait for the smoke to
clear

SOUXIE
The catacombs make the police
nervous They don’t like to go very
deep in here

GEORGE
I don’t blame them

As the smoke clears they see

INT ARTIST ALCOVE - NIGHT

They are in a kind of artists’ gallery The walls are all
painted beautiful

The police are nowhere to be found

PAPILLON
Ha ha Police will never catch
Papillon

An ARTIST creeps out of the shadows and curses Papillon out
for bringing the authorities there He hates the smoke bombs
and despises the tourists that Papillon brought with him

ARTIST
Cessez de réduire la police ici

PAPILLON
Détendez Je les ai évités avant
que nous soyons arrivés ici

ARTIST

Et cette fumée ruine ma peinture
PAPILLON

Bonne chose que votre peinture est

terrible

Scarlett approaches the Artist’s work It really is
beautiful
SCARLETT
Cest trés beau

The Artist appreciates this very much

ARTIST
Merci

PAPILLON
Avez-vous vu la Taupe

ARTIST
Non Il na pas 6té par ici

PAPILLON
La Taupe has not been here We must
look for him

GEORGE
There are over 200 miles of
tunnels You suggesting we wander
them aimlessly until we find this
weirdo

PAPILLON
Je ne sais pas

Papillon leads them on

INT CATACOMBS CORRIDOR

Papillon leads them through a corridor as Scarlett looks

her map

PAPILLON
(calling out)
La Taupe C’est moi Papillon

SCARLETT
Wait We’re going in the wrong
direction We need to be going that
way

PAPILLON
We haven’t found La Taupe

SCARLETT
Is it possible that he’s not down
here

PAPILLON
The artist said he just saw La
Taupe a couple hours ago

over

SCARLETT
No he didn’t I speak French
That’s not what he said

PAPILLON
La Taupe knows every cave

Scarlett holds up her map

SCARLETT
So do I

PAPILLON
You think because you see something
in a book you know it

Papillon smacks the map as he talks

Going the

PAPILLON (CONTD)
This is not the catacombs This
will not tell you anything Which
ones are filled with water Which
ones are too full of bones to pass
Which ones have collapsed If you
want to follow this map go ahead
I’m going to find La Taupe because
these caves are dangerous and you
need to know where you’re going

SCARLETT
I’m going Who’s with me

GEORGE
Scarlett He’s right

SCARLETT
Why are we wasting our time with

GEORGE
You know I don’t want to spend an
extra minute down here than I have
to But if this guy says he needs
La Taupe I’m inclined to trust
him

SCARLETT
He doesn’t even know that the guy
is down here Or where he is

slow way is very much against Scarlett’s nature

GEORGE
If the stone is down here it’s
been here for six hundred years
(MORE)

GEORGE (CONTD)
Itll keep for a couple extra
hours

She reluctantly relents

SCARLETT
Okay

George turns to Papillon

GEORGE
Now don’t make me look like an
asshole

As they cross through another room strange electronic music
plays

PAPILLON
Come

INT CATACOMBS CINEMA

Papillon leads them through a slightly larger space On one
side half a dozen cataphiles sit in what look like stone
bleachers cut into the wall

On the other side a movie -- the old silent version of
“Phantom of the Opera” with Lon Chaney The image has been
“remixed” to Aphex Twin creating an interesting blend of old
and new The movie shows the Phantom descending under the
Parisian Opera house into the catacombs

PAPILLON
Our cinema

George looks at the relaxed Parisians watching a movie down
here

GEORGE
You guys are freaks
INT CATACOMBS CORRIDOR
As they cross through a corridor Papillon points out a small
replica of the Bocca della Verita in Rome (A giant disk of a

carved face with an open mouth)

He nudges George points at it

PAPILLON
According to legend this statue
will bite off your hand if you tell
a lie

George is loosening up a bit

GEORGE
Let’s give it a shot

He reaches his hand toward it thinks for a moment
GEORGE (CONTD)
You might not believe this but my
nipples are perfectly shaped like
little Elvis heads Early Elvis
George slides his hand into the carved mouth

SENDING BATS SHOOTING OUT FROM THE STATUE

GEORGE (CONTD)
Aaah Shit I hate this place

Papillon has a good laugh at George

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Yeah thanks guy

As they cross to the far end of the corridor they hear
something --

A kind of industrial dance music The beats build as they get
closer

Papillon looks to the others does a little rave-y dance
smiles and runs toward the music

George and Scarlett look to each other This fucking guy

The music gets louder as they get closer As they turn a
bend they see

INT CATAPHILE RAVE

AN underground rave lit in flashing reds and pulsing techno
music People shuffle and dance like the possessed

At a glance it looks like people might be having sex in the
dark corners Others are scantily clad in underwear or less
People wearing masks and horns and animal headdresses The
kind of underground party we all know probably happens
somewhere but would never get invited to ourselves

Papillon pushes his way through the crowd trying to ask
people - through the noise - if they’ve seen La Taupe
A SKINHEAD grabs Scarlett pulls her into the crowd starts
grinding on her He’s wearing nothing but combat boots and

his underwear revealing a swastika on his chest

Scarlett pushes away but he’s aggressive

George jumps forward hitting the Skinhead across the face
slamming him back through the crowd and onto his back

Other Ravers jump to the Skinhead’s aid striking George in
the mouth Scarlett tries to intervene on George’s behalf
but no words can be heard over the pulsing music

People very tough very scary people corner George One
takes a swing but George blocks it George gets ready for a
real fight He’s amped up

Scarlett inserts herself between George and the crowd

Papillon pushes his way through and holds the ravers off
George

Scarlett and George push their way through the crowd and back
out of the room

INT CATACOMBS CORRIDOR

As they clear the room the flashlights overpower the
strobes They can hear again

George touches the back of his hand to his mouth and sees the
blood

GEORGE
(to Scarlett)
You’re welcome

SCARLETT
I didn’t thank you

GEORGE
That guy was all over you

SCARLETT
I could’ve handled it myself

GEORGE
Yeah really

PAPILLON
Those people are crazy people
Dangerous people

Papillon makes a crazy sign with his hands

PAPILLON (CONT’D)
You overreact

GEORGE
I literally punched a Nazi How am
I suddenly the asshole

SCARLETT
I’m not some damsel in distress I
don’t need your help

George looks around At himself In the catacombs

GEORGE
Yeah Since when

SCARLETT
(playful)
Don’t kid yourself You wouldn’t
want to go toe-to-toe with me I’m
pretty tough

GEORGE
You That’s ridiculous

She draws a line in the sand on the floor Stands on George’s

side of it
SCARLETT
Try to move me across this line
I’1l show you

Papillon laughs and claps

GEORGE

I’m not going to push a girl
SCARLETT

Because you’re scared of her
GEORGE

I’m not this is so stupid What

you have some self-defense-class-
karate-move you learned in case
somebody tries to grab you That’s
all well and good unless somebody
pushes you

He rushes at her

GEORGE (CONTD)
LIKE THIS

Scarlett steps toward him nails him in the solar plexus
knocking the wind out of George

GEORGE (CONTD)
Oh

SCARLETT
I might know a little more than a
self-defense-class-karate-move

Papillon laughs raises her hand up in victory

PAPILLON
The champion

GEORGE

I think he just called you a
mushroom

INT CATACOMBS MUSHROOM ALLEY

They enter an alcove with bright fluorescent paint on the
walls a lot of it of mushrooms or other hallucinogenic-
inspired motifs

Papillon calls down a tunnel

PAPILLON
La Taupe

They are all looking a bit tired They’ve covered a lot of
ground already

A voice calls out from the darkness

LA TAUPE (0S)
Chantez-le

Papillon stops does a weird little jig

PAPILLON
(sings)
La Taupe La Taupe La Taupe C’est
moi c’est moi c’est moi Papi
Papi Papi ion ion ion

From the darkness a voice sings

LA TAUPE
Papi papi papi ion ion ion
C’est moi c’est moi aussi La
Taupe est le garcon

La Taupe rushes out of the shadows and gives Papillon a bear
hug his face obscured in shadows under his hooded
sweatshirt

PAPILLON
Mon ami étrange

LA TAUPE
Mon ami puant

La Taupe looks at Scarlett and George suspiciously

LA TAUPE (CONTD)
Qui sont-elles

PAPILLON
Ils sont ok Vous ne vous inquiétez
pas

LA TAUPE
Pourquoi ont-ils des appareils-
photo

PAPILLON
Ils font un documentaire environ

LA TAUPE
Non

La Taupe covers his face with his hand
LA TAUPE (CONTD)
(to the camera)
You cannot film me I do not permit
to you filming me

Benji drops the camera low

LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
Go Get out of these place

He takes a beer bottle and throws it at them almost hitting
George

GEORGE
Whoa

Papillon holds up a hand Give me a sec He walks off with La
Taupe
GEORGE (CONTD)
This doesn’t bode well

George and the gang watch Papillon and La Taupe exchange
terse words After a discussion Papillon returns

PAPILLON
He will join us

SCARLETT
Great

GEORGE

If we still want him Guy threw a
bottle at my head

PAPILLON
He just threw it It wasn’t at your
head

GEORGE
It skimmed my head I felt it on my
hair

PAPILLON
But first he sleeps

GEORGE
Sleeps Did you say “first he
sleeps

PAPILLON

He has eaten the how you say

Papillon looks around points to a graffiti image of a
mushroom

PAPILLON (CONT’D)

These
GEORGE
Mushrooms
PAPILLON
Oui Mushrooms
GEORGE
He’s on mushrooms
PAPILLON
Yes
GEORGE

How long ago did he eat them

PAPILLON
Two hours

GEORGE
So he’s going to be high for like
another six

Scarlett looks at him George shrugs his shoulders I know
whats up

PAPILLON
We stay here for the night

GEORGE
For the night

PAPILLON
Yes We sleep

GEORGE
No Fuck this I’m out I gotta get
out of this place I’m packing my
shit up and leaving

SCARLETT
How will you find your way back
out

GEORGE

It’s that way

The camera pans off to show the long dark corridor George
points at

PAPILLON
Go ahead Try We’ll send a search
party for you in a couple days

GEORGE
You know I’m getting real sick of
your tone

PAPILLON
I’m sure the skinhead party would
love to see you again without me to
save you

GEORGE
You didn’t save me

SCARLETT
Why don’t you just try to relax

GEORGE
Because I’m trapped under the
ground In a rat filled tunnel that
was dug in the 1500s Our tour
guide is high as a kite and so far
weve been walking in the wrong
direction What could possibly stop
me from relaxing

Papillon lights up a joint Offers some to George
GEORGE (CONTD)
Perfect solution Let’s everyone
get high I’m sure nothing bad
could happen then

Papillon turns to walk away

GEORGE (CONTD)
Wait Give me that

George has a hit off the joint

PAPILLON
It’s good yes

GEORGE
We have better in America

Papillon smiles George does too Maybe this won’t be so bad

INT CATACOMBS MUSHROOM ALLEY

Glow sticks light the space to save flashlights

La Taupe now wearing a kind of industrial mole mask that
he’1l continue to wear spins little flaming balls on strings

to music It’s kind of beautiful

Souxie takes something out of a small kit She crosses out of
the room into the darkness of a tunnel by herself

Papillon drinks beer and talks with Scarlett and La Taupe as
Zed practices throwing rocks into a bucket

PAPILLON
You don’t seem like a treasure
hunter

SCARLETT

I’m not really

PAPILLON
Then why search for this stone

LA TAUPE
It doesn’t make any sense A rock
that can turn other rocks to gold
and - AND - can also make you live
forever Doesn’t make sense

SCARLETT
Science was different back then
Alchemists were looking for a
connection between what was inside
them and what they were observing
in the outside world They were
trying to perfect themselves make
themselves pure as gold while
working in metals They respected
inner truth more than outside
facts

She turns back to Papillon

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I guess I’m not searching for
treasure so much as I’m searching
for proof of the miraculous
Because if even one alchemist
succeeded if one perfected himself
and his own mind and talents and
knowledge to the point that he
could bend the laws of physics
then we all could Every one of us

Papillon shrugs Maybe

PAPILLON
Gold is good too

Scarlett grabs a couple beers and crosses the room toward
George

The camera turns to George anxiously sitting alone
Scarlett approaches George with a beer

SCARLETT
You okay

George shrugs a bit

GEORGE
Not my favorite place

SCARLETT
So I gathered
She offers George a beer He takes it

SCARLETT (CONTD)
When’s the last time we had a beer

together
GEORGE
It’s been awhile hasn’t it
SCARLETT
You never returned my calls After
Turkey
GEORGE
I know
SCARLETT
I’m sorry I left you there
GEORGE
I know
SCARLETT
I’m glad you’re here
GEORGE
(reluctant)

Yeah Me too If you’re right this
could be the greatest
archaeological find ever As big
as finding the Holy Grail

SCARLETT
I know

George looks around the space

GEORGE
I used to love exploring caves with
my brother as a kid He was so
daring and cool and older

He remembers it all so vividly

GEORGE (CONTD)
A rock I was standing on dislodged
and rolled onto his leg pinning
him We tried and tried but
couldn’t get him out I went to get
help but I got lost trying to find
my way back

This pains George terribly

GEORGE (CONTD)
By the time we found him the tide
had come in and he was gone

SCARLETT
That’s awful I’m sorry

GEORGE
Yeah It was

He shrugs

GEORGE (CONT’D)
It wasn’t because you left me
there

SCARLETT
What’s that

GEORGE
Why I didn’t call you back It
wasn’t because you left me

SCARLETT
It wasn’t

He looks at her seriously

GEORGE
I was afraid I was falling in love
with someone so obsessed with the
dead there’s no room left over to
love the living

She takes this in for a moment Not one to take criticism
easily
SCARLETT
And I never thought I’d fall for
the kind of guy who runs the second
things get complicated
She turns and goes back to the fire with the others

GEORGE
Shit

Camera powers off

INT CATACOMBS MUSHROOM ALLEY

Darkness Snores Sleeping people rustling around Someone
moves in the space

BA-BA-BA-BA-BA-BA-BA

Suddenly the opening chords of the White Stripes “I Think I
Smell a Rat” rip through the darkness

Everyone frantically searches for a light

George is first to get his hands on a flashlight which he
flips on and looks for the source of the music

It’s La Taupe in his industrial mole mask blaring a stereo
at them “Say Anything” style

He dances to the music and laughs at their startled
reactions

He turns off the music

LA TAUPE
We go

La Taupe turns and leaves down a corridor expecting them to
catch up

GEORGE
(under his breath)
Asshole
The bleary-eyed explorers hustle to pack up and follow
SCARLETT
(to Papillon)
This “Mole” guy always so annoying

Papillon shakes his head
PAPILLON
He gets worse
INT CATACOMBS CORRIDOR - LATER

La Taupe winds them through corridor after corridor He knows
his way around here like his own neighborhood

George tries to talk with him

GEORGE
Papillon told me you pretty much
live down here

LA TAUPE
Down here there is no rules No
law Here I do whatever I want when
I want it

GEORGE
You do a lot of drugs don’t you
LA TAUPE
Yes
George looks around
GEORGE

I can’t imagine a place Id less
want to eat mushrooms
(thinks )
Maybe jail It’s a toss up
INT BONE TUNNEL - LATER

La Taupe stops in front of a corridor filled with human
bones

LA TAUPE
Stay on top Parce que rats

PAPILLON
Careful there are

GEORGE
Yeah we get it

La Taupe scrambles over the bones effortlessly

George goes next followed by Scarlett each crawling behind
the next

LA TAUPE
(to George)
Come closer Get close

George crawls over the bones getting closer behind La Taupe
not sure why Taupe is asking him to do so

La Taupe rips a fart right into George’s face and laughs

George looks back to Scarlett

GEORGE
Not sure why the French have such a
reputation for being rude I’ve
always found them so pleasant

The camera moves with Scarlett as she climbs across the
bones She is anxious as the bones creak underneath her A
swarm of rats make noise underneath

The tunnel gets tighter and tighter as they go to the point
that Scarlett is barely thin enough to fit through

Benji gets caught

BENJI
I’m stuck

LA TAUPE
Fat tourist

PAPILLON
(to La Taupe)
Arret

BENJI
I can’t move

Scarlett struggles to turn back to Benji

SCARLETT
Can you take off your pack

BENJI
I already did

Benji struggles more and more against the space

SCARLETT
You’re making it worse Stop
struggling Take a breathe

BENJI
Ah The rats are nipping at me Go
Just go I need to get out of here

SCARLETT
Benji stop Stop You need to back
up a bit You’re lodged and

BENJI
Fuck I hate this

SCARLETT
Move back Just inch back

BENJI
No No Just

SCARLETT
Benji The only way forward is
backward INCH BACK INCH BACK

BENJI
Okay okay

He inches back

BENJI (CONTD)
There are people behind me too I
just need to get out of here I
don’t like this

SCARLETT
Move your right shoulder down and
inch back

Benji moves

SCARLETT (CONTD)
No no no I’m sorry Your left

shoulder

BENJI
I’m freaking out I need to get
out

SCARLETT

Keep breathing Just take a deep
breath with me

BENJI
No I need

SCARLETT
Take a deep breath

Scarlett takes a deep breath and exhales
SCARLETT (CONTD)
Your body expands when your blood
pressure rises You need to calm
yourself Come on

She does it again He joins her this time

BENJI
It’s not helping
SCARLETT
You’re going to be okay Move your
right shoulder down an inch

BENJI
Like this

SCARLETT
That’s right Now see if you can
adjust the bones underneath you
Flatten them out line them up

BENJI
I

SCARLETT
Just do it

BENJI
Okay

His shaking hands arrange the bones

BENJI (CONTD)
Ow A rat just bit me Ah Fuck

SCARLETT
It’s okay It’s okay Benji You’re
going to be fine Just follow me

Benji pulls against the cave It rumbles slightly

BENJI
It’s gonna collapse

SCARLETT
Just push Push through it

He does And finally breaks free

INT BONE CHAMBER - LATER
They all file out of the bone tunnel
LA TAUPE
This is why we don’t bring fat

Irish tourist to the catacombs

La Taupe jabs his finger into Benji’s gut

LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
This guy this fat guy he do not
belong here Fat guy you should
have taken fat man hall

La Taupe points to another hallway that leads to this same
end point They didn’t have to do this to Benji

SCARLETT
We didn’t even have to go through
there Why are you making this
harder than it has to be

LA TAUPE
It’s more interesting this way

Scarlett snaps She pushes him up against the wall
SCARLETT
I don’t care who you think you are
but the next time you take a chance

with my people I’1l hurt you
Seriously

La Taupe’s mouth showing under his mole mask smiles

LA TAUPE
English girl has fire

He nods that he understands amused by Scarlett’s spunk
The ceiling dusts them all a bit

SOUXIE
We shouldn’t stay very long

GEORGE
Was that bad

They look to see a stone pillar that should be holding up the
ceiling has fallen

PAPILLON
That is bad

SCARLETT
Were still not deep enough We’re
only two hundred feet below ground
We need to go down another hundred

The ceiling dusts them again

GEORGE
I think we should move out of this
area It seems suspect to me

SCARLETT
(to La Taupe)
We need to go deeper

He reluctantly nods

LA TAUPE
Come

INT CORRIDOR

La Taupe leads them into the next corridor He shines his
light around until he finds some planks of wood on the
ground He pries them up revealing a hole in the floor that
goes very deep

George looks at it

GEORGE
This is a bad idea Scarlett

SCARLETT
Papillon could you take George and
anyone else back who wants to go
I’m going deeper

PAPILLON
And let you keep all the treasure
No I’m going with you
GEORGE
(to Scarlett)
At what point will you stop

SCARLETT
When I find it

GEORGE
And if there is no stone

SCARLETT
There is And it’s down there

She nods to La Taupe

LA TAUPE
Allez
INT CHIMNEY CHUTE
One after another
catacombs They’re
underground

George looks up to

they descend deeper and deeper into the

all feeling the tension of going this deep

the vast distance above him

GEORGE

(to La Taupe)
How do you know we’1ll all be able
to get back up there

LA TAUPE

If we can’t we die So we will

GEORGE

Not really the answer I was hoping

for

INT WET HALLWAY -

LATER

They all wade through the muck 300 feet underground Spirits

are sagging

BENJI

How long have we been walking

George looks at his watch

GEORGE

About 6 hours

BENJI

Can we stop to eat soon

LA TAUPE

Hungry fat Irish

BENJI

Jesus give it a rest At least I
live in the real world

This kind of animosity is settling over all of them

GEORGE

(sings)
Just sit right back and youll hear
a tale A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this tropic port
Aboard this tiny ship

Scarlett smiles Joins in

GEORGE AND SCARLETT
The mate was a mighty sailing man
The skipper brave and sure Five
passengers set sail that day
For a three hour tour

Benji jumps in too

GEORGE SCARLETT AND BENJI
a three hour tour

Papillon wont be outdone He jumps in on the next stanza in
French trying to out-sing them with the French version of
the song

GEORGE SOPHIE AND BEN PAPILLON
The weather started getting Devenir commencée par temps
rough rugueuse Le bateau minuscule
The tiny ship was tossed a 6té jeté en lair Sinon
If not for the courage of the pour le courage de 1équipage
fearless crew courageux que le Vairon
The Minnow would be lost the serait détruit le Vairon
Minnow would be lost soyez détruit

The other French speakers jump in too everyone now singing
at the top of their lungs for language domination

GEORGE SOPHIE AND BEN PAPILLON TAUPE SOUXIE ZED
(CONT’D) La terre réglée de bateau sur
The ship set ground on the le rivage de cette ile
shore of this uncharted inexplorée de désert avec
desert isle Gilligan
With Gilligan Le capitaine aussi
The Skipper too Le millionnaire et son
The millionaire and his wife épouse
The movie star La star de cinéma le
The professor and Mary Ann professeur et Mary Ann ici
Here on Gilligans Isle sur lile de Gilligans
They all get so loud they miss La Taupe shouting to them

LA TAUPE
Arret Arret

They all stop They have reached the end of the tunnel
Nothing but a wall in front of them
Scarlett references her map

SCARLETT

Should be another ten feet that
way

LA TAUPE
There is no more

Scarlett picks up a stone and taps on the wall Solid
She looks around thinking

SCARLETT
There must be another way to get
there

La Taupe consults his own personal map of the system of
caves He shakes his head

LA TAUPE
There is no more C’est fini

They all look for any sign of anything But there is nothing
there

PAPILLON
Does this mean no treasure

SCARLETT
I don’t know

PAPILLON
(bummed)
Dommage I was excited to be rich

Scarlett scans the surface for a sign an inscription
anything

She thinks and thinks She looks at her map Mutters to
herself thinking through everything that’s led them here
getting more and more frustrated

SCARLETT
There’s nothing

GEORGE
Sorry Scarlett

SCARLETT
I really thought we had it right

GEORGE
I know

He sees how sad she is
GEORGE (CONTD)

For what it’s worth I thought we
had it right too

PAPILLON
Are we ready to go the other
direction

GEORGE
Scarlett

SCARLETT
Yeah

Scarlett looks down at the compass on her wrist A flash of
insight

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Wait Wait Direction Magnetic
north

GEORGE
What

SCARLETT
Magnetic north True north remains
fixed but magnetic north shifts
about 25 degrees per hundred

years

GEORGE
Which by now would have produced
a

SCARLETT

Variation of about 15 degrees Not
here There

A second small tunnel leading off the one they’re in They
race into it
INT SMALL TUNNEL

Scarlett throws her pack down and scans the walls with her
fingers

She digs into the stone Sees something

GEORGE
Oh my God There’s something there

SCARLETT
I know

She digs and digs

GEORGE
Don’t wreck it
SCARLETT
Look
GEORGE
What is it
LA TAUPE
La Taupe does not like the

vultures

La Taupe is right on the wall is a SMALL INSCRIPTION OF A
VULTURE

SCARLETT
Winged vulture

She looks to George

SCARLETT (CONTD)
What was it “Winged vulture leads

your way”

GEORGE
“with brightest light in
darkest day”

She looks at the vulture up close

SCARLETT
“Winged vulture leads your way”

She follows the angle of the vulture’s beak across the wall
until it hits a second wall

She digs around at the joint of the two walls Sure enough
there’s a crease

SCARLETT (CONTD)
There’s something here

George is there in a flash

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I think it’s a Ptolemaic hinge

It looks like a scarab embedded in the stone She kneels down
and finds another one

GEORGE
Really I’ve never seen one
before
PAPILLON
What’s a Ptolemaic hinge

SCARLETT
It’s how they sealed pharaohs
tombs in ancient Egypt The hinges
formed a kind of riddle almost like
an ancient padlock There are a
series of moves you must get
precisely correct

PAPILLON
Or what

SCARLETT
Or it’1l fall on you and crush you
Or the ceiling would collapse or
something else awful that would
probably kill you

GEORGE
Jesus

She gets ready to give it a shot The cataphiles
back away just in case

GEORGE (CONTD)
Wait What are you doing Giving
it the old college try

SCARLETT
You have a better idea

GEORGE
Yeah Go home Not get crushed and
die
She smiles at him
SCARLETT
Okay you do that but I’m going to
take a shot
He hesitates for a moment
GEORGE
Against my better judgement may I
ask what your plan is

She opens her notebook

SCARLETT
What was the on the tomb

cautiously
GEORGE
“Underneath heaven’s reign”

SCARLETT
Heaven’s reign The celestial
spheres 8 planets Except Uranus
wasn’t discovered yet 7 planets

She gets ready to pull the door

GEORGE
Wait Was this built before or
after Copernicus

SCARLETT
Good point Before

GEORGE
So they still believed everything
rotated around the Earth

SCARLETT
Which means the Earth was not
counted as a planet

GEORGE

But the moon was As was the sun
SCARLETT

So eight
GEORGE

That’s my count

She slides the stone out to the seventh line
rumbles as the weight resettles

They look at it Seems okay

GEORGE (CONT’D)
What’s next

SCARLETT
Now we twist

GEORGE
How far

Scarlett remembers the inscription out loud

SCARLETT
- “atop this pair’ed fate”

The

ceiling

GEORGE
Pair twins

SCARLETT
Twins Of course Gemini According
to the Egyptian calendar Gemini
would fall at three o’clock ona
dial Ready

George nods nervously Papillon backs up
She twists the stone and it spirals outward as it moves

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Okay okay Gemini

She stops The ceiling rumbles a bit again Sand pours from
beside the stone as the rumbling intensifies

GEORGE
I don’t like this game

The stone slides toward them

SCARLETT
Back up

La Taupe runs for the door

GEORGE
What’s happening

SCARLETT
I don’t know

The stone drops out of place and lands on the floor with a
thud revealing

A SMALL TUNNEL ABOUT 30 FEET LONG BARELY WIDE ENOUGH FOR A
PERSON TO SQUEEZE THROUGH La Taupe quickly crowds in to
look

Scarlett shines a light into it but it doesn’t reveal much
beyond a single rat scurrying out of sight

GEORGE
No way I’m crawling through that

BENJI
Ditto

SCARLETT
This is probably the first time
someone has shined a light in that
space in over 500 years

LA TAUPE
A new tunnel

PAPILLON
The treasure

SCARLETT
Give me a boost

Papillon places his knee so she can use it to climb through
Scarlett climbs into the hole

She barely squeezes through but keeps going and going and
going Her breathing gets labored as she pulls her way

through

From the door side of the hole we see her clear the other
end She turns back to face the others

SCARLETT (CONT’D)
George You gotta see this

George thinks it over

GEORGE
What is it

SCARLETT
George Seriously Come here

George really doesn’t want to do this

GEORGE
Shit

He climbs into the hole and struggles through it to join
Scarlett

INT ROSE CHAMBER

George comes out the other side and rolls out of the hole
He stands to find

A tomb atop which is laid A CORPSE CLEARLY SEVERAL
CENTURIES OLD PERFECTLY PRESERVED

GEORGE
Hello

SCARLETT
He’s dead

GEORGE

How is he not rotting

SCARLETT
I don’t know

The headstone is marked “CR Of RC”

GEORGE
CR Of RC

SCARLETT
Christian Rosenkreuz of the Rosy
Cross

GEORGE

No The founder of the
Rosecrucians Holy shit

(catches his language

apologizes to the corpse)
Sorry

(to Scarlett)
His tomb was found by Rosicrucians
in the 1600s Along with the
secrets of

SCARLETT
-alchemy which reignited its
interest for the next 200 years

George notes another inscription

GEORGE
“VITRIOL” What’s that

SCARLETT
The motto of alchemy It stands
for “Visita Interiora Terrae
Rectificando Invenies Occultum
Lapidem”

GEORGE
(translates)
“Visit the Interior Parts of the
Earth by Rectification Thou Shalt
Find the Hidden Stone”

The others have been filing in

PAPILLON
Is he dead

GEORGE
Yes For 700 years

PAPILLON
Creepy

The middle of the chamber is filled with water making it
echo creepily in the space

SCARLETT
There’s more “Visit the interior
parts of the earth” He’s saying to
go deeper

GEORGE
Were kind of interior already
don’t you think

SCARLETT
What was the “Winged vulture
leads your way In brightest light
in darkest day”

Scarlett sees something in the water Looks closer
She turns off her flashlight

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Turn off your flashlights
Everyone

BENJI
With a dead body in here No way

SCARLETT
Just do it

They all do so Benji having the hardest time submitting to
darkness

But as Benji clicks off the onboard light submerging the
group in total darkness we see what Scarlett saw traces of
light deep in the water

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Where’s that light coming from if
that’s a wall

Papillon flips his flashlight on pokes at the wall Scarlett
drops herself down into the water

The camera travels with Scarlett under the water as her hand
pokes at the stone deep in the water
She rises back up now soaking wet
SCARLETT (CONTD)
There’s a loose stone Someone help
me
Papillon jumps in with her The two drop into the water
Again the camera drops in with them as they pull against a
large stone They dislodge it and pull it away from the wall

revealing more light

Scarlett just comes up long enough to take a breath and rip
her backpack off

She then dives back down into the murky brown water pushes
herself through the opening and swims into a brighter light

She clears the wall and pulls herself up on the other side

INT ALCHEMIST CHAMBER -— CONTINUOUS

As she rises up it is obvious that THIS IS THE PLACE THEYVE
BEEN SEARCHING FOR

SCARLETT
Oh

There are lit torches on the walls Gold all around them

The floors walls and ceiling are lined in alchemical symbols
and ancient Egyptian symbology Eerie and magical at the same
time

Scarlett laughs still not believing her eyes

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I found it Dad You were right

George comes up out of the water He sees what she does

GEORGE
Oh my God

SCARLETT
Yeah

She can’t help but get choked up

GEORGE
It’s real

SCARLETT
It’s real
George takes a seat
GEORGE
I think we’re gonna need a bigger
bag
La Taupe rises out of the water

LA TAUPE
Mon dieu

He takes a gold coin Shoves it in his pocket And another
and another

PAPILLON
I’m quitting my job

There is a big pile of coins that seem wedged between the
floor and ceiling La Taupe pulls at them trying to dislodge
them

Souxie and Zed appear and also pocket coins

GEORGE
How are these torches lit

SCARLETT
The Philosopher’s Stone can fuel a
lamp for eternity

GEORGE
So where is it The stone
SCARLETT
“The brightest light in darkest
day”
GEORGE
The sun

She smiles

She points at an ancient-Egyptian-inspired painting of a male
god stretched across the floor of the chamber

SCARLETT
In ancient Egypt the earth god and
the sky goddess

She points to the ceiling where a goddess lined with stars
hangs

SCARLETT (CONTD)
- were madly in love But when
they had they first child the sun
he became so jealous of their
affections that he pushed them
apart from each other leaving them
only able to touch by the palms of
their hands and the soles of their
feet

She points now to a winged stone painted between the two
gods

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Every morning the sky gives birth
to the sun and every evening she
swallows him back up

She takes out a knife and makes her way to the winged stone

With all the opulence surrounding them this one chalky
purple stone would hardly be worth noting

GEORGE
That’s it It looks so ordinary

Scarlett smiles

SCARLETT
What better place to hide the most
valuable stone ever known than
beside riches you could never miss

Papillon and La Taupe furiously bag piles of coins and other
treasures

Scarlett uses her knife to edge the stone out of its place
and carefully places it in a cloth satchel she brought
specifically for this

SCARLETT (CONTD)
You wouldn’t believe the trouble I
went through to find you

She tucks the stone into a waterproof pocket

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Okay let’s get out of here

They turn around La Taupe and Papillon pull furiously at a
mound of coins wedged so tightly between floor and ceiling
it takes two of them to pull the coins free

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Wait Is that

She looks at the ceiling

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Load bearing

As the coins break free THE CEILING CRACKS Chunks drop all
around them

LA TAUPE
Run

They all struggle get up and run like mad as THE CEILING
CRUMBLES OVER THEM

BOOM

A huge echoing crash as THE CEILING DROPS They race away
from it barely escaping being crushed under its weight

Brown dust completely envelops them blotting out all the
light in the room Nothing but darkness It’s suddenly very
quiet still Some coughing and struggling Someone is
crying in pain

Scarlett’s voice is the first to pierce the darkness

SCARLETT (0C)
Is everyone okay

GEORGE (0C)
Yeah I think I’m okay

ZED (0C)
Oui
LA TAUPE (0C)
I am
Pause
SCARLETT
Papillon Souxie
Nothing

GEORGE
Papillon Souxie

As the dust begins to settle traces of their head lamps poke
through the darkness

The sounds of whimpering muffled

GEORGE (CONT’D)
I hear someone

The air clears a bit more A hand sticks out of the rubble
George is on it in a second pulling stones off and tossing
them aside

Souxie breaks through the rubble Coughing In pain

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Are you okay

SOUXIE
Papillon

George pulls her out of the rubble She’s banged up and
bruised has a nasty cut on her arm but she’s okay

SCARLETT

Papillon if you’re goofing
around

Nothing
Scarlett sifts back into the rubble No sign of Papillon
Zed drops under the water and looks Nothing

GEORGE
Jesus Papillon

Nothing
George turns on La Taupe

GEORGE (CONT’D)
You asshole You could have killed
us all

George goes after Taupe but Scarlett and Zed intervene

SCARLETT
Stop We shouldn’t disrupt the
space any more than we already
have

SOUXIE
Is Papillon dead

LA TAUPE
We’re all dead That was the only
way out

He’s right They are all enclosed in a small room with no

exit

SOUXIE
Ay

Souxie’s arm is hurting her
GEORGE
Where’s the first aid kit We need
to clean up that cut
They all look around

LA TAUPE
The packs are buried

GEORGE
Water Food

They all look at each other Nothing

SCARLETT
Spare batteries

Nope

LA TAUPE
Once the headlamps go out

GEORGE
Let’s start conserving

George turns his off dropping the light of the space down

considerably Benji does the same

George pokes around at the rubble looking for a way out

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Maybe we could dig our way out

LA TAUPE
With what Your hands

SCARLETT
He’s right This chamber was
created by master builders If they
wanted to trap the unworthy we’re
trapped

GEORGE
So what we just sit here and wait
for the air to run out

(MORE)

GEORGE (CONTD)
We’re all just cool hanging out
waiting to die

George looks around the room They’re all trying to wrap
their heads around the situation Terrified

Scarlett looks closer at the structure around them

SCARLETT
Those lamps are Freemason by
design

GEORGE
So

SCARLETT

Freemasons never built something
like this without a back door just
in case it collapsed on them

She keeps inspecting their surroundings She takes a rock and
taps on the walls listening for something that sounds
hollow Nothing

The floor and the ceiling seem to be painted and inscribed
the same exact way almost as if there were a mirror running
the length of the floor

SCARLETT (CONTD)
“Rs above so below” That phrase
is the key to all magic

She continues to search for something that doesn’t fit while
continuing her thought

SCARLETT (CONTD)
It means basically what is within
me is outside of me What is on
earth is in heaven As I am so are
my cells so are my atoms
Basically what I believe the world
to be so it is

She sees something

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Look

She points to a rectangle inscribed on the ceiling that’s
covered in alchemical symbols

GEORGE
What is it

SCARLETT
The Porta Alchemica The door to
the mystical

GEORGE
So it’s a door

George grabs a rock and gets ready to chisel at it

SCARLETT
No Look That symbol of the door
on the ceiling is the only thing
not replicated on the floor

Scarlett shines the light from the rectangle on the ceiling
down to the floor directly beneath it

GEORGE
So
SCARLETT
“As above so below”
GEORGE
So if
SCARLETT
If they painted a door on the
ceiling
GEORGE

Then there would be a door on the
floor too

LA TAUPE
There is nothing below us This is
the bottom of the Catacombs

Scarlett takes the rock from George She kneels down in the
water in the gutter at the bottom of the chamber She hits it
with the rock Hits it again And again

CRACK She looks around at the others as the water drains out
of the bottom

GEORGE
(to La Taupe)
That water must be going somewhere

Scarlett doubles her efforts hitting the shit out of the
rock until

CRACK

The floor of the gutter beneath her gives She rushes away
from it as the stones beneath her feet give way and disappear
off into nothingness

LA TAUPE
This isn’t catacombs Look at the
edges This wasn’t made by man Who
knows where this could lead

SCARLETT
Whatever it is it’s a possible way
out

GEORGE

Oh going deeper

Scarlett picks a rope and lowers herself down into the chute
The descent is eerie dark

They watch as she goes And goes And goes

Scarlett stops She takes a flashlight and shines it around
looking at what’s in front of her

SCARLETT
There’s a passage down here
INT THE GATES - CONTINUOUS
Scarlett places her feet on the ground and looks up to find

A very small opening with a large stone arch over it It
looks ancient Very very ancient

The others file in behind her
Something about this space makes them all feel uneasy
Scarlett notes the ancient inscriptions on the arch
SCARLETT
Can you read that What does it
say

George dusts it off to get a better look Reads it quietly to
himself thinking through the meaning

GEORGE
“Bbandon all hope ye who enter
here”

Scarlett understands

SCARLETT
Oh

LA TAUPE
What

SCARLETT

According to mythology that’s the
inscription over the gates of hell

LA TAUPE
I’m not going in there

SCARLETT
(to La Taupe)
I thought you didn’t believe in any
of this

LA TAUPE
I don’t

La Taupe is deeply unnerved by the idea of crossing this
threshold but there truly is no other choice

The entrance is so small so low to the ground that they’1l
have to slide through it one at a time

Scarlett notes it
SCARLETT
“And they shall be made to crawl on
their bellies into the kingdom of
darkness”

GEORGE
Yeah That occurred to me too

LA TAUPE
I don’t like this

They prepare themselves to cross through

Scarlett goes for it She slides her pack through and follows
closely behind it

INT ALCHEMIST CHAMBER 2

Scarlett stands up in the next room to find

IT’S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ALCHEMIST CHAMBER THAT COLLAPSED

ON THEM Same artwork on the ceiling Same gold Same missing
Philosophers Stone Though this room is still intact

It sounds a bit different this side of the threshold Like a
faint throbbing drone in the background

George stands up behind Scarlett looks around

GEORGE
Whoa
She looks at him
SCARLETT
Yeah
LA TAUPE

It’s exactly the same
Scarlett points at one of the painted gods on the wall
SCARLETT
Not exactly They’re facing the

other direction

She’s right This room looks like THE MIRROR IMAGE of the
earlier Alchemist Chamber that collapsed on them

La Taupe turns back considering his options He drops to his
knees and digs around furiously looking for something They
follow his eyes to find what’s freaking him out - THE SMALL
ENTRANCE THEY CRAWLED THROUGH SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED

LA TAUPE
What happened to the entrance

THE SMALL ENTRANCE IS GONE There is no retreat
La Taupe stands and looks at them very seriously

LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
Are we dead

They all contemplate this for a moment

SCARLETT
No

Scarlett sees the fear rising in her group

SCARLETT (CONTD)
We should keep moving

She takes a deep breath and lunges underwater pushing her
way under the rock to the other side

INT ROSE CHAMBER 2
Scarlett comes up on the other side A mirror image of the
rose chamber The same tomb THIS TIME WITH A ROTTEN CORPSE
ATOP IT
Scarlett looks around nervously
The others join her one at a time
George looks past Scarlett
GEORGE
(calling out)
Hello

She spins to find

A FIGURE STANDING AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM In the dark
it’s hard to see more than a faint shape

George’s voice echoes through the long chamber
No reaction Nothing
They all look at each other not sure what to do

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Can you hear me

Nothing

The figure moves a little muttering quietly to himself -
like a man possessed

LA TAUPE
(quiet)
Maybe he knows a way out
(calling out)
Do you know a way out

Nothing The figure just keeps muttering to himself
Scarlett takes a step toward him And another

GEORGE
What are you doing

SCARLETT
We have to pass him

She’s right The hole that leads beyond is just behind the
figure

They inch forward

FIGURE
WRRRGAAAAHHH

They all freeze as the figure moves repetitious erratic
like someone with severe mental illness

The figure takes another step forward stepping into the
light

REVEALING PAPILLON

SOUXIE
Papillon

Nothing No reaction

Souxie moves to the front of the pack Old friends with
Papillon

SOUXIE (CONTD)
Papillon Et-tu bien

No reaction

GEORGE
How’d you get here

Nothing
Souxie moves closer They all follow her

SCARLETT
Careful Souxie

Souxie gets closer

SOUXIE
Et-tu bien Papillon

As they get closer they can hear pieces of what he’s
muttering

He doesn’t seem to see any of them

SOUXIE (CONTD)
Papillon

She inches closer and closer She reaches out to touch his
shoulder

SOUXIE (CONT’D)
Pap

BOOM

IN A FLASH PAPILLON VICIOUSLY ATTACKS SOUXIE CRASHING HER
RIGHT THROUGH THE CAMERA (which falls into the water framing
the rest of the incident from an odd angle) AND SLAMMING HER
HEAD AGAINST THE FLOOR OVER AND OVER SCREECHING
FEROCIOUSLY

EVERYONE RUSHES TO SOUXIE’S DEFENSE fighting to rip Papillon
off her

PAPILLON FALLS AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS

Benji picks the camera up off the floor and spins it to try
to cast light on Papillon

GEORGE
Over there

Nothing

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Where’d he go

BENJI (0C)
What the fuck

Scarlett tends to Souxie who is unconscious and bleeding
from the face and mouth

SCARLETT
We need to get her out of here We
need to get her help

LA TAUPE
Papillon

Everyone is shaken up

SCARLETT
Grab her legs

GEORGE
Okay Okay

La Taupe lost his mask in the struggle revealing TERRIBLE
BURN SCARS ON HALF HIS FACE He helps George and Scarlett
lift Souxie

They rush her to the small opening at the end of the chamber
exactly the same as the one behind the Ptolemaic hinged door

SCARLETT
Give me the rope

Zed grabs the rope and hands it to Scarlett
SCARLETT (CONTD)
Tie her feet and lift her into the
hole once I get through

Scarlett squeezes through nothing but her feet visible to
the others

INT SMALL TUNNEL 2

It’s tight in the tunnel with Scarlett Her breathing labored
and nervous

As she nears the end she hears something in the next room
She stops Listens What is it Someone’s voice She’s
scared but this isn’t the place to stop She climbs forward

She approaches the end of the hole very slowly worried about
what she might find in the next room

She suddenly pushes her way out

INT WET HALLWAY 2

Splash

She falls out the other side into the water She jumps to her
feet and scans the room looking for anyone who might be in

there She doesn’t see anyone

She looks at her arms Blood She dips her hand in the water
looks at it Dark red

She looks around the room again

SCARLETT
Okay Send Souxie

GEORGE
I’m coming first So I can help
pull

George climbs through He drops into the water beside
Scarlett

He too notes the “water”

GEORGE (CONTD)
Is this blood

SCARLETT
I don’t know
George tastes the liquid off his fingers

GEORGE
It tastes like blood I think

SCARLETT
(very serious)
Let’s just keep going

GEORGE
Yeah

George and Scarlett pull Souxie through the tunnel while
keeping an eye behind themselves just in case
INT WET HALLWAY 2 - SOON AFTER
They all rush onward sticking close together on edge
They arrive at a hole in the ground Much like the one they
descended earlier
INT CHIMNEY CHUTE TOP 2
GEORGE
Great Everything is the mirror
image of what we’ve already done

but somehow it keeps going deeper

BENJI
How deep will this take us

Zed finishes lowering his rope He does the math in his head

ZED
Another 100 meters

GEORGE
Making it 1000 feet beneath the
earth’s surface That’s pretty

deep

ZED
Deeper than the Eiffel Tower is
high

GEORGE

Yeah I get it

INT CHIMNEY CHUTE BOTTOM 2

Scarlett and George get to the bottom Look left to find the
bone chamber

Scarlett steps back into the chimney and helps spot the
lowering of Souxie

Only Benji remains above

FAINT VOICE (0C)
Scarlett

SCARLETT
Do you hear that

GEORGE
What

FAINT VOICE (0C)
Scarlett

GEORGE
Is that Benji

SCARLETT
(shaken)
I don’t think so
Scarlett steps into the chimney Calls to Benji
SCARLETT (CONTD)
You okay up there Benji
INT CHIMNEY CHUTE TOP 2
Benji kneels alone up top tense lowering Souxie down The
camera sits on the ground beside him cropping him strangely
Is something moving in the shadows behind him
He hears a faint cry A baby
He uses the camera’s onboard light to look around Nothing
He lowers Souxie down a little further Scarlett calls up to

him

SCARLETT (0C)
You okay

He hears something Is someone lurking in the shadows

BENJI
Is someone up here

Nothing

SCARLETT (0C)
Benji You okay

He hears else Looks Nothing He calls down to Scarlett

BENJI
Yeah

He hears something directly behind him and spins to find

A WOMAN IN A BLOODY NIGHTGOWN HOLDING A DEAD INFANT HER FACE
IS CONTORTED SAVAGE INSANE

BENJI (CONTD)
Aah

Benji jumps away from her dropping the line and slipping on
the edge of the chute

INT CHIMNEY CHUTE BOTTOM 2

Souxie drops the last ten feet landing with a thud

SCARLETT
Oh Benji you just

BOOM

They all spin to find BENJI BEHIND THEM DEAD FROM A FALL
DOWN THE CHIMNEY CHUTE

They look up the chimney chute Is someone looking down at
them

George checks Benji’s vitals Shakes his head Dead

GEORGE
What just happened

SCARLETT
I don’t know

Scarlett bends down and strokes Benji’s hair tenderly

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I’m so sorry Benji

ZED
We should keep moving

George snaps to

GEORGE
Hand me the camera We might need
the onboard light

Zed grabs it hands it to George

INT BONE CHAMBER 2

They shuffle over the bones in the chamber as fast as they
can each struggling against the fear of getting trapped
here

George sees something under the bones He shines a light into
it to get a better look

Underneath the bones is a gutter full of water in which a
YOUNG MAN struggles to get to the surface of the water to
breathe

GEORGE
Danny Danny

The Young Man pushes against the bones but George’s weight
on top of them makes it impossible for the Young Man to
breathe

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Get off the bones He’s drowning
down there Everyone get off the
bones

The Young Man seems to keep pace with George as he
desperately tries to get out of the way

GEORGE (CONTD)
NO NO

This is tapping a deep nerve in George

He gets to the end of the bone chamber and checks back to
find the Young Man gone

George covers his mouth and takes a few beats Scarlett
approaches him

GEORGE (CONT’D)
It was so real

SCARLETT
You okay

GEORGE
Why Why would he be here

SCARLETT
It’s not him I think this place
knows our pain and is using it
against us

In the distance SOMEONE SCREAMS MERCILESSLY - and not the
kind of scream you hear in movies the kind you hear in an ER
at 4 in the morning

They all move very close together getting more and more
unnerved
INT CORRIDOR 2

The screams become more and more present as the gang
approaches Seems like it’s coming from mushroom alley

The light in the corridor looks different too As if lit by
firelight

They turn the corner to find

INT MUSHROOM ALLEY 2

A CAR IN FLAMES IN THE MIDDLE OF MUSHROOM ALLEY A SMALL
FAMILY INSIDE THE CAR SCREAMING MERCILESSLY REACHING FOR LA
TAUPE

LA TAUPE
NO NO

La Taupe obviously knows what this is
LA TAUPE (CONTD)
No CE NETAIT PAS MON DEFAUT CE
NETAIT PAS MON DEFAUT

La Taupe races to the car trying to help the people
Scarlett and George try to pull him away

BOOM
IN A FLASH the BURNING MAN catches hold of one of La Taupe’s

legs La Taupe struggles against the man losing his shoes
socks pants in the struggle

LA TAUPE (CONT’D)
Help me Help me

George and Scarlett grab La Taupe’s arms and try to pull him
free but it’s no use

CRACK The ground beneath the car seems to be cracking

THE BURNING CAR COLLAPSES INTO THE GROUND AS THE BURNING MAN
GRABS LA TAUPE BY THE HAIR

The ground swallows up the burning car and La Taupe but the
ground closes at La Taupe’s knees leaving La Taupe’s lower
legs sticking out of the ground flailing in pain as the
sounds of his singeing flesh and agonized screams below

Everyone rushes to his side trying in vain to pull him back
out of the ground His flesh burns them to the touch

George nudges Scarlett points A figure hovers in the
shadows at the edge of the corridor they came from

They hurry through the room to the next hallway
Scarlett hears something

SCARLETT
Music

Sure enough They hear music in the next room Similar to the
electronic music the ravers played earlier

ZED
They might know a way out

Scarlett leads George and Zed (who still carry Souxie) into
the music to find

INT CATAPHILE RAVE 2

The cataphile party but it’s very different now Through the
strobing lights the ravers seem to scream inaudibly
writhing in pain while BRUTALLY DEVOURING EACH OTHER

The music is different too It’s full of cattle screams
grinding cacophonous noises awful

Our gang turns off all lights and hustles through the hellish
sight as fast as they can

Suddenly THE ONBOARD LIGHT ON THE CAMERA FLIPS ON
ILLUMINATING THE RAVERS AND THEY ARE ALL FUCKED UP EYES
BLEEDING MOUTHS SCREAMING Horrific

The camera shakes George spins around to find a raver
desperately trying to take refuge behind him George pushes
away from the raver as another one grabs him

George hits him with the lens of the camera but the ravers
keep coming

In the struggle George loses his grip on Souxie

THE RAVERS SUDDENLY SWARM SOUXIE RIPPING HER TO PIECES IN
SECONDS DEVOURING HER RAVENOUSLY

George jumps back from the mayhem but loses his footing

A Raver drops onto George trying viciously to rip into him
George fights like mad to keep the Raver at bay and even
gets back to his feet as

ANOTHER RAVER RIPS A HUGE BITE OUT OF GEORGE’S NECK shooting
blood into the air George drops to his knees bleeding
uncontrollably

Scarlett and Zed grab George’s arms and pull him into the
next room In the confusion Benji’s camera strap has twisted

around George’s arm The camera slides with them as he’s
pulled into the next room

INT CATACOMBS CINEMA 2

The cinema’s screen now shows a “remixed” version of the 1922
silent film “Haxan - Witchcraft Through the Ages” It’s
bizarre upsetting creepy

Scarlett tries desperately to stop George’s bleeding neck

SCARLETT
No No

Nothing is working

SCARLETT (CONTD)

(to Zed)
Come here Put your hand here Keep
pressure

She rips into her bag Pulls out the Philosopher’s Stone
She crumbles some of it off rubs it into his wound
Watches

Nothing

SCARLETT (CONTD)
It doesnt work

George mutters something
SCARLETT (CONTD)
What What was that

GEORGE
(barely audible)
“VITRIOL”
SCARLETT
VITRIOL
She gets it

SCARLETT (CONTD)
“Visit the Interior Parts of the
Earth by Rectification Thou Shalt
Find the Hidden Stone”

She looks at George

SCARLETT (CONTD)
This isn’t the right stone I have
to rectify the taking of it Only
through putting it back will I find
the real hidden stone

She stands looks around the dark creepy chamber

SCARLETT (CONTD)
Oh fuck

She contemplates it

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I’m going back

Zed thinks he’s surely not understanding this right

ZED
We must keep moving forward

SCARLETT
We’re more than half a mile
underground By the time you and I
lift him out of here he’1l be
dead

She looks over her gear preparing herself
SCARLETT (CONTD)
And I’m not going to let that
happen

She runs back toward the rave room

Note The following sequence of Scarlett on her own will be
filmed only by the GoPro camera on her head We will see her
arms and legs hear her vocal and breathing reactions but
won’t see her face Instead we’ll experience the following
as she does

INT CATAPHILE RAVE 2

Scarlett rushes into the room The same music the same
lights But this time there’s only one person there dancing
alone amongst all the devoured flesh Wearing a bull mask
The bull mask moves but doesn’t seem to be looking directly
at her She races to the next room

INT MUSHROOM ALLEY 2

Scarlett races through Mushroom Alley nothing left but a
small smouldering hole where La Taupe was swallowed up

INT CORRIDOR 2

A FIGURE at the other end of the corridor stops Scarlett in
her tracks Doesn’t look like Papillon Older heavier

A VOICE behind her

VOICE
Scarlett

She spins around to find

HER FATHER RIGHT BEHIND HER But something’s wrong with him
His legs are like tree trunks grown into the floor His arms
like brittle twigs with blood dripping off them

She jumps away from the sight

SCARLETT
Dad

And bumps into something behind her She spins to find
HER FATHER THERE TOO

Her bumping him has broken off one of his twigs causing him
to howl in pain

SCARLETT’S FATHER
No What have you done

SCARLETT
What do you

She backs away from the sight again bumping into something
behind her Her father is there too

SCARLETT’S FATHER
You look just like my daughter

SCARLETT
It is me dad

SCARLETT’S FATHER
No You’re not her She would never
come here

Scarlett bumps something else turns her father is there
too

SCARLETT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
She would know If she ever came
here there would be no way out
She’d be trapped here Forever

She runs from the room choking back sobs

INT BONE CHAMBER 2

As she crosses the threshold into the next room she bumps
into her father here too

SCARLETT’S FATHER
Forever Forever Forever Forever

His voice takes on a shrill screeching quality Like a bad
dream in which a loved one suddenly seems possessed

She keeps moving but this place is really taking a toll on
her

Scarlett shuttles over the bones in the bone tunnel

Again she sees her Father in this room too The multiple
voices of her Father doubling tripling into a cacophony of
agony

SCARLETT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
Ever Ever Ever

She clears the bones and rushes into the next alcove near
the chimney chute SOBBING AS SHE GOES This is the loneliest
moment of her life

INT CHIMNEY CHUTE 2

Her father continues to squall in the background as she makes
her way to the chimney chute She can’t reach the opening
well enough to get footing

She kicks off her shoes to get better traction takes a
running start jumps up and grabs hold of the rock wall She
struggles to make her way up the first couple feet

As she gets some height in the chimney chute without ropes to
protect her one false move would send her plummeting to her
death

Her foot slips and she almost drops She takes a couple deep
breaths

SCARLETT

You can do this Don’t think Just

keep going
INT CHIMNEY CHUTE 2 - LATER
Scarlett gets to the top of the chimney chute but getting
out of the circular hole isn’t easy She has to carefully
position herself as she inches herself to solid ground beside
the hole
INT WET HALLWAY 2

She rushes through the bloody water as fast as she can
trying to make up for lost time in the chimney chute

AN ARM REACHES UP FROM UNDER THE WATER AND GRABS HER LEG

She jumps at the feeling and pulls against it Another arm
Another Arms reach up and grab her from every direction
pulling her under the bloody water

INT BLOODY POOL

Scarlett fights against the arms pulling her every which way
She plants a foot on a stone ledge and pushes with all her
might

INT WET HALLWAY 2

Scarlett breaks through now covered head to toe in blood

She rips her way free of the grabbing arms

She catches her breath overwhelmed freaked out

INT SMALL TUNNEL 2

Scarlett rushes through the small tight tunnel leading to the
Rose Chamber

INT ROSE CHAMBER 2

Scarlett lands in the Rose Tunnel looks around all safe
She hurries through

SCARLETT
Ow

She looks down at her feet illuminating

HEADS BURIED UP TO THEIR NOSES IN STONE THEIR EYES
HORRIFIED WATCHING HER

Other heads have nothing but their mouths showing and they
try to bite anything passing

She does her best to avoid the faces but sustains a series
of bites on the way drawing blood

She dives into the water at the end to swim back into the
alchemy chamber

INT ALCHEMIST CHAMBER 2

Scarlett enters the Alchemist Chamber What once looked so
opulent and breathtaking in its beauty now looks evil
depressing lonely

SCARLETT
“By Rectification Thou Shalt Find
the Hidden Stone”

She pulls the rock out as she scours the Egyptian images
looking for the eye of Ra she originally took the stone from

She finds the eye Lifts the stone Too high She slides a
rock into place and stands on it She lifts the stone toward
the eye of Ra

It clicks right into place A perfect fit
SCARLETT (CONTD)

Okay I’ve rectified Now
where’s

The stone in its place she drops her eyes to find a mirror
right in front of her face

SCARLETT (CONTD)
the hidden stone

Thoughts play across her face She understands something she
hadnt before
INT CATACOMBS CINEMA 2
George and Zed in the cinema
A GROUP OF 5 FIGURES ENTER FROM THE FAR END OF THE ROOM Zed
quickly flips the camera’s onboard light off dropping the
room into near darkness except for the projected images from
the silent movie
THE FIGURES MOVE AS IF IN SLOW MOTION IRREGULAR SILENT
THEY FLOW LIKE WAVES TOGETHER IN IRREGULAR BURSTS AS IF ONE
ORGANISM IN 5 BODIES

ZED

(quiet)
Shhh

George desperately tries to keep quiet despite his neck
wound
INT ROSE CHAMBER 2
Scarlett races through the rose chamber where the rotting
corpse’s body has been restored to it’s un-decayed state
INT CATACOMBS CINEMA 2
George and Zed hide
The Figures seem not to have noticed them
The camera lies right behind Zed and George just catching a
piece of the passing Figures which makes the anticipation

almost unbearable

The Figures stop as they get close One of them slowly turns
his head LOOKS RIGHT AT ZED AND GEORGE

INT CHIMNEY CHUTE 2

Scarlett plants her feet and descends the Chimney Chute as
fast as she can She is focused driven

She hits the ground at the bottom and runs for the bone
chamber

INT CATACOMBS CINEMA

The Figures move closer and closer - still in their bizarre
slow motion - to George and Zed

GEORGE
(quiet to Zed)
Go

Zed thinks about it for a moment

ZED
No

Right as the figures are about to grab onto them Zed grabs
George under the arms and pulls him furiously toward the next
room

The Figures stop One turns his head to look at them They
pivot and keep following in slightly quicker motion The
Figures move slowly but consistently toward Zed and George

Zed pulls George as fast and vigorously as he can but these
Figures are gaining on him

Scarlett sprints right around the Figures as Zed pulls George
into the adjacent corridor As Scarlett passes them one of
the Figures reaches out in fast motion trying to grab her
but she dodges him just in time

INT CORRIDOR 2

Scarlett grabs George’s other arm and helps Zed create a
little distance from the Figures

INT CATACOMBS CINEMA 2

Scarlett races to George’s side He’s unconscious In bad
shape

ZED
Did you find the stone

SCARLETT
Yes

Scarlett stops in the middle of the corridor Zed drops the
camera to the ground beside them flips the light on so
Scarlett can see The scene is framed irregularly Scarlett
and George’s heads cropped strangely

SHE PLACES HER HANDS OVER GEORGE’S WOUNDS KISSES HIM DEEPLY

He comes to coughs up blood She moves her hands away from
his wound to find his wounds gone

ZED
How did you do that

SCARLETT
I am the stone As are you As we
all are As above so below

The Figures are getting closer and closer

ZED
Scarlett

She looks sees them coming nearer and nearer George regains
consciousness He touches his wounds to find himself healed

Scarlett and Zed help George to his feet The three of them
run from the room as the Figures approach

INT ARTIST ALCOVE 2

They race into the Artist Alcove

The camera’s onboard light (their last remaining light)
fritzes out then comes back on

They look around the room to find it a dead end There is
however a large hole in the middle of the floor

GEORGE
Dead end

SCARLETT
No

Zed looks to the hole He takes a rock and drops it into the
hole It goes and goes and goes seemingly never hitting the
ground

ZED
We’1ll never be able to climb down
that

The onboard camera light goes out

SCARLETT
No No We’re so close

GEORGE
There were paintings on the wall
Did you see them

SCARLETT
No I was looking for an exit

ZED
I have matches

SCARLETT
You do

Zed digs through his pockets Counts them

ZED
Three

SCARLETT
Light one

Zed lights one It flashes and goes out revealing the FIGURES
NOW IN THE ROOM APPROACHING

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I couldn’t see it Light another
one

GEORGE
Don’t let it go out so fast

Zed lights another match Scarlett scans the room for
anything that could give a clue The Figures are getting
closer She sees Egyptian hieroglyphic paintings on one wall
as the match goes out

The match goes out

SCARLETT
I found something I didn’t have a
chance to really see it though
Light the next one Hurry

ZED
This is the last one

SCARLETT
I know Go

He lights the match This time she gets a quick look at the
painting

The painting shows the Ancient Egyptian demon AMMUT - part
lion hippopotamus and crocodile - the “soul eater” Behind
him looks like one part of a scale with a feather on it A
painted beam from that scale rises up to the ceiling and
across above them and seems to end right over the hole

The match goes out

SCARLETT (CONTD)

(very quickly)
The “soul eater” In Egyptian
mythology after you died you went
to the underworld where your heart
was weighed against a feather If
your heart weighted more than a
feather the soul eater would eat
your heart and you were condemned
to nothingness

The camera flickers for a moment She uses the light to make
her way to the hole

SCARLETT (CONTD)
We need to make our souls lighter
than a feather And then we jump

GEORGE
We what

The camera flickers the Figures are now very close
SCARLETT
What is the thing that weighs your
soul down The thing you’ve never
told anyone
She goes first
SCARLETT (CONTD)
The night my dad killed himself He

called me and I didn’t answer

The pain of this taps a real nerve in her

SCARLETT (CONTD)
I wasn’t doing anything important
I just didn’t feel like talking to
him When I think of what he must
have been feeling

George takes her hand
GEORGE
When I went to get help for my
brother I panicked and forgot to
remember how to get back to him
And he died because of it
Scarlett nods gently to him They look to Zed
ZED
I was in a car that ran a man over
I never reported it

Scarlett takes Zed’s hand too

The camera light flickers THE FIGURES ARE RIGHT THERE
SECONDS AWAY

SCARLETT
On three

GEORGE
This isn’t going to work

SCARLETT
You don’t have to believe in it
George But if you take the jump
it’ll work
He nods The three of them join hands

SCARLETT (CONT’D)
One two THREE

They step into the abyss together and fall

INT ABYSS - CONTINUOUS

The camera rattles around banging off the walls as they
fall screaming through the nothingness

It just seems to go on and on Falling and falling

INT CATACOMBS ENTRANCE AREA
BOOM
They hit a rock wall and fall to the ground beside the hole

They look around to find paintings and graffiti like that
found near the surface

George smiles

GEORGE
We’re not dead

ZED
It worked

There above them is a ladder leading up to a manhole cover
on the surface

They scurry up the ladder excited by the idea of getting out
of this place open the manhole cover slowly to find

EXT PARISIAN STREET - NIGHT

Paris

Scarlett and George and Zed step out onto the Parisian city
street surrounded by cafes and revelers partying and

celebrating life

SCARLETT
It worked

The three of them embrace

GEORGE
See ya around Zed

Zed watches on as George and Scarlett walk off into the
Parisian night holding each other close surrounded by
Parisians blissfully unaware of the hell that lies beneath
their feet

FADE OUT
