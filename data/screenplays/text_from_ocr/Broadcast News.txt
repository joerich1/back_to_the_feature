INT HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

AARON ALTMAN looking almost preposterously young in his

graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory He is a
rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent
AARON

and finally to the teachers of
Whitman High School I dont have the
words to express my gratitude which
may have more to say about the quality
of the English Department here than
my own limitations

He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
discomfort

AARON
-that was of course not meant to
be taken seriously A personal note
I am frequently asked what the special
difficulties are in being graduated
from High School two months shy of my
fifteenth birthday I sometimes
think it was the difficulties
themselves which enabled me to do it
If Id been appreciated or even tolerated
I wouldnt have been in such a hurry to
graduate I hope the next student who
comes along and is able to excel isnt
made to feel so much an outcast But
Im looking forward to college this is
the happiest day Ive had in a long
time I thank you and I forgive you

This is very little applause
ANGLE ON TEACHERS

MALE TEACHER
Im always so confused by Aaron
Is he brave and earnest or just
a conceited little dick-head

BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER
ANGLE ON STAGE

As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
semi-literate high school graduates

YOUTH 1
Later Aaron

EXT SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
cuff Aaron around

CLOSER IN

Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
covered with bloodas he gets to his feet He is livid --
something primal triggered by this brutality

AARON
Go ahead Stephen -- take your
last licks
(points at his
face)
But this will heal -- what Im

going to say to you will scar you
forever Ready Here it is

He dodges as they come after him They catch him by the hair
and hurl him to the ground As he gets up he hurls his
devastating verbal blow

AARON
Youll never make more than
nineteen thousand dollars a year
Ha ha ha

They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
concrete

AARON
Okay take this Youll never
leave South Boston and Im going
to see the whole damn world Youll
never know the pleasure of writing
a graceful sentence or having an
original thought Think about it

Hes punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground As the
Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
conversation

YOUTH TOUGH
Nineteen thousand dollars
Not bad

INT SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

JANE CRAIG ten years old is in her room typing Above the
desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
pictures tacked to each one Her desk has several file racks
which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side Jane types
very well in the glare of her desk lamp

JANE

(voice over as

she types)
Dear Felatzia its truly amazing
to me that we live a world apart
and yet have the same favorite music
I loved the picture you sent and
have it up on my bulletin board
Youre growing so much faster than
I am that I

OTHER ANGLE
SHOWING Janes FATHER standing near the door

JANE
(voice over)
Â»am starting to get jealous
I read in the newspapers about
the Italian strike and riots in
Milan I hope you werent

FATHER
(softly)
Honey

Jane SCREAMS and grabs her heart breathing heavily babbles
nervously at her Dad

JANE
Oh God -- Daddy -- dontdont
dont ever scare me like that --
please
We SUPER FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER

Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction
Falling back towards the door

FATHER
Jane -- For Gods sake
(recovering)
Look its time for you to go
to sleep

JANE
I just have two more pen pals and
then Im done

FATHER
You dont have to finish tonight

JANE
(he doesnt get in)
Nooo This way the rotation stays
the same

FATHER
Finish quickly I dont want you
getting obsessive about these
things Good night

We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
troubled

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
mid-60s -- Hunter Thompson the New Journalism the slim

Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room

JANE

Dad you want me to choose my words
so carefully and then you just throw
a word like obsessive at me Now
unless Im wrong and

(enunciating)
-please correct me if I am obsession
is practically a psychiatric term
concerning people who dont have anything
else but the object of their obsession --
who cant stop and do anything else Well
Here I am stopping to tell you this Okay
So would you please try and be a little
more precise instead of calling a person
something like obsessive

She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out
even with two additional pen pal letters to get off she had
enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from
the room She exits the room INTO BLACK
Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES

OVER EXT SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind

of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours The
Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
news assignment the sort of treasure you love about all else
yet never mention She stops running as she feeds quarters into
the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
different papers before moving on

INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY

As she enters from the bathroom having showered and dressed
The sun is jus now rising She sits next to her phone

INSERT JANES ROOM

The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
hand-fashioned tool of Janes trade She flicks at a page --
takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
room number of her crew and reporter

ON JANE
As she dials one room number

JANE
(into phone)

new condo with Maria they gonna

JANE
A half hour in the lobby

AARON
(Austrian accent)
Okay Ill see you in the lobbies sic

She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
bed for a moments solitude She sits stiffly palms on top of
her legs It looks like someone with unusually good posture
waiting for something and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
redden and she begins to cry Now she sobs -- then miraculously
shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom This crying
episode is clearly part of her morning routine

INT BUS STATION - DAY

Jane in the distant bg on the phone Aaron and crew shooting

INT JANES ROOM - NIGHT

Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit

AARON
Wheres where I asked him about
being scared
(then)
You should work on your speech

JANE
No It makes me nervous to think
about it Lets do this

She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot

AARON
(on tape)
All this business of war -- do you
get scared

JD
(on tape he smiles)
Uh-uh
(then)
Im a little freaked right now about

He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away

JANE
I love that turn away

INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled On
the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
Local Television News Broadcasters

JANE
(in darkness)
Theres a point Im trying to make
about these pieces coming up

A WOMANS OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED

WOMAN
(os angrily)
I dont think any client of mine
makes less than fifty thousand dollars
a year which means they can afford the
best and youre damn right I feel good
that that includes me
CUT TO

ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
in blackness her VOICE DISGUISED

WOMAN TWO
(os)

No Youd be surprised at who a
working girl meets Ive been a
working girl for what -- over a year
anyway and that must be a thousand
men and I dont think theres an age
or type that hasnt been in there

INTERVIEWERS VOICE
(voice over)
Policemen -- Doctor -- Lawyer

WOMAN TWO
(os)
Oh sure Television reporters

A laugh from the audience There is a
CUT TO

ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
A WOMAN in blackness

WOMAN THREE
(os)
Im seventeen now and Ive been
working the streets for two years
and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
thinking of it as temporary

The lights come up on the room The two screens go black
there is general APPLAUSE Jane blinks nervously

JANE
Please dont applaud

ON AUDIENCE

Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country
remarkably similar in comparisona great looking woman good
looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
or Hispanic They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
sincerity of Janes plea which she presses with more urgency

JANE
Please Dont
(she yells)
I gathered these pieces as an
example of whats WRONG with local
television news

The applause stops

JANE
The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
SERIES on prostitution were
SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
stations in one city during sweeps
week By what bend of either or
suspension of duty is that broadcast

news
She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none
she continues An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
gesundheit simultaneously -- they laugh

JANE
The legacy of Edward R Murrow
Eric Sevareid William Shirer
David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
is being squandered in a desperate
popularity contest Our profession
is in danger

TRACKING SHOT

As Jane continues REVEALING that the news team now have even
more in common They do not like Jane

JANE
Yesterdays compliment has somehow
managed to become todays kiss of
death To be considered a serious
journalist is no longer flattering
It presents the risk of being labeled
ponderous or worse yet elitest
right

SHOT CONTINUES

Women playing with their hair young man boredone
middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie

ON JANE
Briefly departing from text

JANE
All of you know what Im talking about
Were all trying to act together than
we are But we care So were all
secretly terrified arent we

Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit her voice
begins to rasp

JANE
We are being increasingly influenced
by the star system The network
anchormen are so powerful they
compromise our last best hope The
current group is clearly qualified
tied still to our best traditions but
who follows these men

TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

Seated with other members of his news team a young blonde
woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg a good looking
Hispanic Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
a speaker she seems a savior

TOM
Wow

His female colleague looks at him
FEMALE COLLEAGUE
Oh Ive known so many women like
that They dont like their looks

so theyre angry

BACK TO JANE

Fumbling with her cards sunk but game -- gamer than she would
wish
JANE
I was going to talk about other
trends but
(mumbling)

the magazine shows news at

profit influence of

Entertainment Tonight the danger the
hope the dream the questionOh I

that was carried by all networks on the
same night -- the same night -- not one

ON MONITORS

Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
networks in the Spring of 1985 It is quite spectacular -- the
dominoes falling into one another provoking waves crossing tiny
bridges setting off little fireworks JANES AUDIENCE applauds
loudly and squeals with delight

ON SCENE

Jane between the two monitors She begins to speak loudly OVER
the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval

JANE

(loudly)
I know its good film I know its
fun I like fun Its just not news

(as they continue

to applaud)
Well youre lucky you love it --
youre going to get a lot more just

STRAY VOICE - SHOUT GOOD
OTHER ANGLE

Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia by the event
Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart She takes
some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return

WIDER

Tom the last person remaining in the room He approaches her --
she is totally unaware of his presence even when he casually
mounts the stage with an athletic leap It takes courage for
Tom to fully intrude himself which he now does

TOM
Hello
She looks up at him
ANGLE ON TOM
Earnest nervous -- handsomeJust when she needed a mirage
there it is
JANE
Hi
TOM

I just wanted to tell youâ how great
you were My names Tom Grunick

JANE
(dumbly)
Thank you
(then)
They hated me I dont hate them

TOM
Well they say if you can reach
even one person it means something
And you did that

Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then
JANE
Would you like to have dinner
with me

INT HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Jane arrives at the maitre d stand She has attempted to dress
up to the extent that packing for a short-day trip allows She
looks for Tom Tom rises from a table and is immediately at

her side

JANE
Hi I was worried I was early

TOM
I was a lot earlier

They are lead to a table and sit down

TOM
I kept thinking what a great break
it was for me to get to see you
tonight More than a great break
maybe just what I neededjust when
I needed itAngel of mercy --
godsendlifesaverwhat

JANE
(picking one)
I like godsend

TOM
I havent been in news that long
Ive just been looking for the
right person to talk to I have
about two thousand questions for you

He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
continues to rest He looks at her a beat

TOM
Its possible nows not the right
time
She lifts her head
JANE

If we could just eat first

TOM
Totally understood Totally
wrong of me to talk shop after
the day youve had Totally
sorry

JANE
Nooo If I could just have a
roll Id be okay

She takes a roll from the roll plate He smiles at her She
takes a bite

JANE
Thank you

EXT CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously
Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is a little
adrift and temporarily free of obligations She is open to
making a memorable mistake

JANE
Another thing I cant stand --
Is this dull

Tom shakes his head almost violently

TOM
No no no no
Jane looks at him curiously -- then
JANE
(broadly)

Another thing I cant stand is
when White House reporters
bullshit with each other after

a briefing and then one of them
has a theory and the other quotes
it in his story as White House
sources Say

TOM
That actually goes on

JANE
Yes My room is down here --
Im not tired Do you want to
keep talking

TOM
Yes sure

INT JANES ROOM - NIGHT

A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
evidencethe quality briefcasethe reams of well organized
notesthe thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --

Tom not far away in the rooms only chair One lamp is on
and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
enormously flattering light MUSIC comes from her miniature
portable STEREO system
JANE
Come onEven Im not that
hard on myself

TOM
No I really got this job ona
fluke and wait till you hear where
it ends up

Jane smiles a calming smile

JANE
I was doing sports at the station
The newspaper ran this untrue story
that I was leaving and they got all
these tons of protest mail So they
made me anchor

JANE
So great -- right

TOM
Except Im no good at what Im being
a success at

JANE
How are you at back rubs

Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom He is
immobilized by the sudden turn Jane waits just a bit longer
than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection She moves
briskly past the moment -- grabbing a good night chocolate

from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda

JANE
Its sort of normal -- the way you
feel In graduate school everyone
thought the only mistake the
admission committee made was letting
them in

He moves to the bed

TOM

Listen to me You keep on thinking
Im somebody ho lacksconfidence
Thats not it I know I can talk well
enough and Im not bad at making contact
with people but I dont like the
feeling that Im pretending to be a
reporter

(contd)
And half the time I dont really get
the news Im talking about It isnt
that Im down on myself Trust me
I stink
JANE
(levelly)
I trust you

TOM
I didnt even have the chance to get
really good at sports I wasnt bad
I thought I was starting to do
interesting features but hockey is
big at the station and

JANE
(interrupting)
What about the obvious remedy
Reversing things Maybe getting a
job on a newspaper

TOM
I dont write

Jane laughs or more accurately scoffs as Tom Continues

TOM
But that didnt stop me from
sending out audition tapes to
bigger stations and the networks

JANE
Well come on -- it is your life
Nobody is tying you to the fast
track Did you go to college

TOM
One yearalmost one year

JANE
So youre not well educated and
you have almost no experience and
you cant write

He nods agreement

TOM
And Im making a fortune

Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
her hands Hes making her feel a little crazy She gets off
the bed

JANE

Its hard for me to advise you
since you personify something that
I truly think is dangerous

TOM
Uh-huh
JANE

(holding it in)
I agree with you -- youre not qualified

(letting it out)
So get qualified You can insist on
being better prepared You dont have
to just leave it as

(mimicking him)
I dont write Im not schooled
I dont understand the news Im reading
But at least Im upset about it folks

A beat then he mumbles softly to himself

TOM
Whoa this was a mistake

JANE
Just what do you want from me anyway
Permission to be a fake Stop whining
and do something about it

He gets up to leave She follows him

JANE
Well you dont have to start right now

He turns to her

TOM
I hated the way you talked to me just
nowand it wasnt just because you
were right

He exits
INT JANES HOTEL - NIGHT
She is on the phone

JANE
(into phone)
No It wasnt just the speech --
the same thing happened with this
guy I have passed some line some
place I am beginning to repel people
Im trying to seduce

INT AARONS APARTMENT - NIGHT
As he talks with Jane
AARON

(agreeably)
He must have been great-looking right
JANE
Why do you say that

AARON
Because nobody invites a bad-
looking idiot to their bedroom

She smiles

AARON
Okay Lets do me

JANE
Sure

AARON
Okay I feel like Im slipping but
do people who are actually slipping
feel that way or is it always the
really good people who are moving up
who invariably think theyre slipping
because their standards are so high

JANE
This conversation is not worthy of you

AARON
Id give anything if that were true

JANE
(laughing)
Good night
AARON

Wouldnt this be a great world if
insecurity and desperation made us
more attractive If needy were a
turn-on

JANE
Call if you get weird

INT JANES HOTEL - NIGHT

She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
on the other half are papers schedules -- tapes She doesnt
clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work
The PHONE RINGS

JANE
(answering)
I was just thinking it was the
shortest phone conversation we
ever had

EXT PHONE BOOTH
A deserted well-lit area Tom on the phone

ERNIE
Any particular area you feel

TOM
To be honest I was best at anchor

Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding

ERNIE
Why dont you take a few days observing
the system Then well put you on

EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room Jane goes over her
timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
monitors BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
Janes bidding On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece

which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline The

PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
which continuing to edit The pressure is palpable to begin
with but builds and builds almost like a family fight getting
out of hand and threatening to bend lives Through it all Jane
remains remarkable calm Her focus is amazing her command sexy

JANE
(consulting notes)
Go back to 316 Bobbie The sound
bite in the cab -- it starts I
dont know how Ill feel

BOBBIE
We could

JANE
(interrupting)
Please Bobbie were pushing

As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape Toms face appears in

the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
Janes eyes click to him briefly She makes not a move to
welcome him He pauses but is committed and tries to find

a piece for himself against the wall

TOM
They said I should observe the

Jane is distracted by the noise Tom leaning over towards her

TOM
They said it would be okay if

JANE
(incredulous)
Were working here You can stand
over in the uh uh uh

She momentarily cant think of the word corner Then back
to Bobbie

JANE
Play back the last line

BOBBIE
He said something about

JANE
(sharply)
Let me hear it

Bobbie taking the sharp commands with ever increasing
yet still repressed resentment

The Assistant Director BLAIR LITTON enters the editing room
She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure

BLAIR
Well need it in ten minutes Were
putting it directly into

Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time

JANE
(into phone)
Craig just a second --
(to Bobbie)
Let me hear it

Through much of this chaos we focus on
TOM

Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear His eyes
dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can
always returning with wonder to focus on Jane

MERCENARY
(voice over)
Its been a long time since Ive seen
my folks and all butI dont expect
any big-deal homecoming

JANE
Stop there
(into phone shes
been holding)
I want to shoot a picture from
a book I have in the office

BLAIR
You dont have time Not a chance
JANE
(into phone)
Ill be right down Its right tight

She crosses out

BLAIR
Ive got to tell Erniebecause
there isnt enough time

JANE
Yes there is

Blair leaves as Jane gathers up her notes She charges out
leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie

TOM
Im Tom Grunick I started on
General Assignment today

Bobbie stops the machine turns in his chair and shakes hands
Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence

BOBBIE
I dont think shes going to make it

Tom exits

Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off

VARIOUS SHOTS
Our chase scene as Blair soars through the newsroom leaping a
chair smoothly smashing her leg against a table in full flight
the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it jumps
nervously during the ride and now in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT barrels
down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
arrives slamming the tape into a technicians hand even as it is
introduced on the air

mercenarys actual homecoming which matches the portrait The
irony works nicely The network anchorman comes up for his close

He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a
journalistic king

She exits
EXT CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

As Aaron Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
in their own conversation Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work

AARON
I didnt sleep Theyre giving me less
and less air time They dont think

JANE
If we dont get to their camp soon

AARON
Last time Paul was sick they gave
Connie the weekend news instead of me

JANE
You spend too much time -- much too
much worrying about that crap
(suddenly reacting)
Oh good

They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped
the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
inside

ANGLE ON

A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot A pair of new boots
sit alongside him Janes Cameraman prepares to shoot saying in
Spanish then English

CAMERAMAN
Put on the boot

Jane rushes into the scene incensed
JANE
Stop We are not here to stage the news
Wait and see what he does
Then to the totally confused soldier
JANE (contd)
Sir you do whatever you want Its

your choice

By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
the news team staring at the guerrilla who is at loss as to
what is expected He looks to Jane who can offer no help
save her own determination not to interfere Finally he puts
on the boot

JANE
(to Cameraman)
Okay

He shoots the scene

to cover his first story He laughs out loud loving his lot

EXT CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

Jane in the fg with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
to the GUERRILLA LEADERS

AARON (in Spanish)
Are you guys kidding or do you really

first time it felt that way and its
going to happen I mean how bad
can it be Are you nervous

to ten -- that were going to be in
a war within the next few hours

He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
talking with calling after him with an added thought
AARON

Thanks you speak English very well
too

(to Jane)
Great news He says theyve been
engaging the Sandinistas pretty
regularly and that hed be really
surprised if we didnt take fire
tonight

Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration Aaron is amazed at her
attitude

AARON
Look at her
(to Jane)
If anything happens to me tell every
woman Ive ever dated I was talking
about them at the end That way theyll
have to reevaluate me

Jane laughs out loud attracting the Guerrillas attention
Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish The Guerrillas laugh

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas They HEAR A SHOT
The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men Aaron
grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left As they run --
more SHOTS Jane in work mode As soon as they settle

JANE
Lets tape

CAMERAMAN
(Spanish accent)
Much too dark Black

JANE
Thats okay

ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
the nearly gunfire

AARON
The first shots were fired not thirty
seconds ago The Contras feel they
must be outnumbered this is so small
a unit thats a given Still they
hold their ground despite the fact
that their weapons have been acting
up -- misfiring or jamming A new
shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
all they got today were the shoes
There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE

JANE
(to Cameraman)
Okay
(to Aaron)
Great line at the end

AARON
Did you shoot their boots

JANE
Of course

AARON
We can cut back at the end

JANE
To the pan of the supplies boxes --

AARON

life for a network that tests my face
with focus groups

(to Reporter)

written in big color highlighted letters As he looks down

to study them everyone else moves suddenly off

TOMS POV
The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions
Will you dispatch troops after the Ambassador theyve been
awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
movement of the vehicle

ON TOM

Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back

CAMERAMAN
(observing Tom)
Whats wrong

TOM

Dont worry its okay I got
a piece of his face

EXT GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

in bg -- a drowsy morning-after feeling
JANE

Are you all packed and ready

CAMERAMAN
The stuff in the dark is not good
Nobody wants news lit like that

JANE
Will you just get packed

She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away holding
a knapsack in her hand She takes off a brush and runs it
through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel

toothbrush brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
from her canteen She puts everything back in place then looks
about sobs for several beats One of the Guerrillas hears her
sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
away Jane finishes notices him makes a face by way of
explanation and exits the scene feeling measurably better

picks up the phone at his anchor desk during the commercial
break

BLAIR
Jane Bill Rorish wants to speak
to you at the break
(as she hands it to her)
I never heard of him handing over
compliments in the middle of the

There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor

ON MONITOR

We see Rorish over the monitor He hangs up

We see on the monitor that this is not so Its a very eggy moment
Aaron Tom breaks the silence

TOM
(to the rescue)
Okay if I watch you tape that interview
downstairs

AARON
Yeah

As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER

AARON
Please laugh so they think Im not
dying inside but have so much style
I just said something funny

Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement
but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated
Blair wants desperately to be inside Aarons joke

BLAIR
What did he say

JANE
(as if still amused)

Ill never tell

ask a question

BUDDY
Could I see how I photograph

CAMERAWOMAN
Huh Sorry

BUDDY
Cause for the interview theyre
going to use a screen and disguise
me to protect my anonymity so could
I see myself before that

CAMERAWOMAN
Sure

The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddys image
comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor Hes not
happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it Aaron enters

Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily

But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush Buddys
internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up
fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
thoughts

Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes

AARON
Its Mr Buddy Felton

BUDDY
Yes

No I think anyone who puckers their
lips and presses it against his boss

JENNIFER

We dont have to settle this
definitively right now

Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane unsteadied
by the dose of self-revelation moves towards Aarons circle
and scratches his back in friendship Tom approaches an she
moves off -- not wanting to deal with him She takes a few
breaths as she keeps walking We HEAR snatches of PARTY
CONVERSATIONS ie

GEORGE WELN
Tell me one person who ever left
television news to work on a
newspaper

She moves on Tom still following

ERNIES WIFE
(holding Pauls arm)
I felt so proud when he turned
down News Vice President so we
could stay here Suddenly after
all these years we have a life

Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
feet away

JANE
(badly)
Hi Tom

She stands there genuinely frightened She must deal with him
now He crosses to her

TOM
Its the firs time Ive seen
you dressed like this You look
so clean and pretty

JANE
What do you mean clean

TOM
At work theres always this
sort of film over you

JANE
Well thumps like me leave appearance
to guys like you

TOM
Youre great at taking the edge
off a good time

Jane starts twitching She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
his arm to steady herself

TOM
You okay

JANE
Yes Just dont say anything mean
for a while Thanks

She meets his gaze for an instant -- and in that instant loses
control for the first time in her memory She looks strange as
she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval

JANE
Ive got to find someone Its
important Excuse me
She walks away
ON AARON AND ERNIE
ERNIE

I had the strangest thing happen
yesterday Anne and I have been
married what -- Thirty-six years
Everything fine -- two days after the
promotion came through I was checking
myself in the mirror and she was
making a face at me behind my back

So yesterday I looked in the mirror
and she was doing it again

AARON
You didnt say anything to her

He shakes his head

ERNIE
My instincts tell me not to
Annie comes up

ANNE
The office is phoning honey

He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go

ANNE
I hope he moves that fast when
its me on the line

ON JANE

As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
picks it up and wraps it around herself a bit chilled She
sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling ina
too loud anxiety-ridden voice as she goes

JANE
Jennifer Hey Jennifer

ON STAIRCASE
Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs

JANE
Forget what I said -- you do
whatever you want to with him

She pushes at Jennifer a little

JENNIFER
Well theres nothing Im going
to do right this second

Jane pushes her again

JENNIFER
But its a party right

Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
down the steps and crosses to Tom

FULL SCENE

Aaron takes in Jane who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
and huddles briefly with Paul The News President is intent
The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer We PICK UP just

a few words

ERNIE
This would be a good time to tap
that source of yours He could
have an angle or something
AARONS POV

Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes Paul and Ernie
now move toward Jane a whole flow of movement creating a new
energy in the area Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
them

ERNIE
(to Jane)
We want you to exec produce a
Special Report

JANE

Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR

ERNIE
A Libyan plane shot up one of our
bases in Egypt Its all still

AARON

JANE
Ernie as much as I like you I

of obscenely stupid

ERNIE
Jane if you want to go ahead I
dont disagree with you
Jane moves quickly off awed at the prospect of taking on the
big boss

ON JANE

As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone eventually
catching up with Paul In the bg Tom has just HEARD the
BEEP of an ANSWERING MACHINE

TOM
Hello Buddy Its 135 -- and
this is Tom You can reach me
at the office Its important
I can use a little help

Jane because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
intensity

JANE
Tom isnt ready for the job
youre about to hand him Not
near ready Not by the longest
shot Aarons spent six weeks
in Tripoli hes interviewed
Gaddafi -- he reported on the
Eight-one story I think hes
essential to do the job were
capable of and I think its my
responsibility to tell you that

PAUL
Okay thats your opinion I
dont agree

JANE
Its not opinion

PAUL
Youre just absolutely right
and Im absolutely wrong

She nods

PAUL
It must be nice to always believe
you know better To think youre
always the smartest person in the
room

JANE
(from her depths)
No its awful Oh my its awful

JANE
(turning to leave)
Wed better get moving
As they move out Jane goes to Aaron He moves with her
towards the door

AARON
What happened
JANE
Ill tell you later -- where

AARON
Watch --

JANE
Ill come by your place right

She runs out the door Aaron turns mean and mocks Janes
last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque

AARON
Yeah love you too

EXT DRIVEWAY - DAY

As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room Tom opens
the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in It moves off

INT TOMS CAR - DAY

As it moves off

JANE
Nervous
TOM
Excited
Jane looks over at him -- theres no question hes just told
the truth

INT TOMS OFFICE - DAY

In the bg we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
activity Tom closes the door He sits down behind his desk
and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there

He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside He picks
one He reaches for a package of new red suspenders He takes
off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
of an expert craftsman By the time he finishes he looks like
the authority figure we know hes now

INT BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

Jane is NOT hyper She is purposeful -- organized -- even
calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
the arm to still her colleagues hysterical demons

JANE
Tell George and Jessica to try
and cover everything without
Tom having to ask additional
questions

BLAIR
And Bobbie says

JANE
Did you hear what I just said --
do you have that Take a breath

BLAIR
(a breath then)
Yes

In the bg Tom has exited his office and looks about --
waiting for some indication as to what to do next

JANE
And the most important thing
make sure his earpiece works
have back-ups ready Thats
never been more vital He
must be able to hear me at
every second and clearly

Jane sees him She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
arm
JANE
We have twenty minutes -- you can

wait in the studio

Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen froma
nearby desk clips it into his inside pocket and walks off

GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
Mirage Fighter

JANE
Put in the radar plane that spotted
them to begin with

GRAPHIC ARTIST
We have no pictures on file

JANE
I cant draw -- but this is a
rough idea
She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane Her work is
stunning

INT AARONS APARTMENT - DAY

He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play He picks
a French song -- looks at some of his books He might even

read He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one
He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French

INT STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up Buddy
is being stopped at the other end of the hallway

ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

GUARD
I have to check first

BUDDY
(a bit frantic)
Well then check -- but hurry --
There he is

Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Toms aide despite Toms
gestures to slow down

BUDDY
Is everything all right

TOM
Yes You didnt have to come here
Its just that Im going to anchor
this special report on this Libyan

thing
BUDDY
(delighted)
Anchor
TOM
(amused despite
situation)

Yes stop I wondered if you could
find out anything about whats

(on Buddys reaction)
Whats wrong

BUDDY
I broke up with my roommate --
He was really the magnet for

everyone who knew anything

TOM
Oh

BUDDY
Look I can start up with him again
if you really

TOM
No Im doing fineLook

Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle

BUDDY
Good Hes on the worlds longest
ego trip let him take it alone

TOM
Hey okay Look Buddy -- Ive

BUDDY
(to Tom)
Â»good-bye then

TOM
Ill speak to you

BUDDY
Well who knows Just let m tell
you what my favorite teacher ever
told me -- Dont be afraid to be
wonderful

He leans forward gives Tom a quick embrace a small kiss on
the cheek Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on

INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
two news execs Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
wall and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
table occupied by Blair Now she slips into the large well
paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE

Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon State
and the White House In front of her the bank of monitors the
Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
Anchor a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy

ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

As she looks at Jane poised to control the complicated apparatus
of minds and machines comprising the big time network news
And Jane Craig is at the helm Blair experiences a flash of
emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it

BLAIR
(sotto to Jane)
Executive Producer -- wow

Jane looks at her and in a moment of atypical merriment does

a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
graphic reading SPECIAL REPORT We HEAR an ANNOUNCERS VOICE
say This is a Special Report from

INSERT JANES CONTROL PANEL
Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect

her to Tom and the Field Reporters She presses the button
marked Tom

JANE
You hear me Tom Tom Tom
Damn itHe cant hear me
(to Blair)

I told you if there was one thing
Toms VOICE on speakers

TOM
(voice over relaxed)
I can hear you I was just teasing

Gulping the air in relief she slumps nonetheless impressed by
the macho cool as

Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
Announcers last words clear

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
(voice over)
in Washington Tom Grunick

He begins his report He seems authoritative compelling even
in a low key way We trust him

TOM
Good afternoon A Libyan fighter
plane attacked a United States
Military Installation early this
morning and was itself shot down
by American F-14 Interceptors

Another monitor shows the Graphic running In the bg two
men approaches Paul They look out of place decidedly
non-business like

MAN ONE
Mr Moore Im Marvin Usher and this
is my brother Stuart

PAUL
Not now
(gesturing)
Look
TOM

The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
Warehouse which just thirty minutes
earlier had been crowded with
servicemen No one was injured

INT AARONS APARTMENT - DAY

Aaron is seated feet up drinking listening to MUSIC -- reading
a book two remote controls are on the cushion next to him He
SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point

providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC

AARON
(SINGING LOUDLY)
And I can read while I sing

He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
television on the SOUND OFF

ON TV

We SEE the graphic of the Libyan planes flight route its
missile firing -- the US planes taking off and the shooting
down of the Mirage jet At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom

TOMS VOICE
(voice over)
The heat seeking missile virtually
disintegrated the plane on
Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC
INT BOOTH
Janes hand flicks at the button marked PENTAGON

JANE
George youre ready

ON PENTAGON MONITOR
We SEE George and HEAR him through Janes voice box

GEORGE
(voice over)
Should I cover everything or should
I save something for Tom to ask about
JANE
Cover everything

George nods

JANE
(hitting Toms button)
Were going to George Say the
Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
George Weln at the Pentagon

ON TOM
TOM
George Weln is at the Pentagon where
the attack launched by the lone
Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
movement of military might
INT AARONS APARTMENT - DAY
Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND

AARON
A lot of alliteration from anxious
anchors placed in powerful posts
He picks up the phone
INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

As Blair hands it to Jane

BLAIR
Its Aaron

JANE
Yes

AARON

I think the pilot that shot down the
Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
here Maybe you could get him --

and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
is one of the hardest planes to fly
Theyre nicknamed Tomcats

JANE

Thanks

(to Tom)

The F-14 is one of the most difficult
planes to master

(remembering)

Oh you call them Tomcats and in
the 70s the first crop had a number
of crashes

TOM
George isnt the F-14 Tomcat one of
the most difficult machines for a
pilot to master

GEORGE
I think youre right -- its certainly

one of our hottest planes

INT AARONS ROOM - DAY

AARON
I say it here -- it comes out there
He giggles
TOM

(voice over)
There was trouble with them in the
early days -- back in the 70s

Aaron dials again As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
White House

AARON

(into phone)
Me again Hi Listen Gaddafi doesnt
foam at the mouth or anything When
you speak to him hes not at all nuts
He seems like a leader -- very
impressive self-controlthats
whats so strange

ON JANE
JANE
Right and we have the 81
pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
will have him
AARON

(voice over)
Youre welcome Sow how does it
feel toI know you gotta go --
Me too Were very busy here

He hangs up -- LONG SHOT Aaron with his remote controls
The picture switches back to Tom He turns UP the VOLUME

TOM
(voice over)
Â»-outlaw nation but strangely those
who have interviewed Gaddafi find
him in a phrase we like to use in
this country very presidential

AARON
Nice Jane

INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Jane is on the phone The atmosphere buckling with strain

JANE
(into phone)
Just a minute

Her finger hits the Tom button

JANE
(to Tom)
To State for the message from Libya
then youll have the carrier pilot
from the Sidra in time to
(a sudden shriek)
What No

ON TOM

Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing

BACK TO JANE

As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume she
is over-the-top livid her face red neck cords popping

JANE
We only have ten minutes left --
how can you talk to me about parking
problems No not youll tryyoull
do it -- do it or Ill fry your fat
ass Estelle Good-bye

As she BANGS the PHONE down Paul comments sotto to Ernie

PAUL
(sotto)
I had no idea she was this good

JANE
(hitting Toms button)
Fill for a second

TOM

(fluidly)
The latest message seems to indicate
that the Libyan pilot was acting on
his own without authority from anyone
else

(into camera directly)
In other words I think were okay

INT STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER
MOVING CAMERA FROM Toms left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE
TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages

even as Tom talks on camera the monitor through which he sees
the subject of his interview at the Pentagon the clusters of a
assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him
beginning to SEE the Control Room in the bg and as we MOVE IN
TOWARDS HIS EAR the white ear piece firmly in place we BEGIN
TO HEAR the barely audible crackle of Janes VOICE as she tells
him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it

TOM
So Commander it must have been
a bit tougher today -- shooting down

the French-made Mirage Jet The one
you got was a SU-22etc

And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHORS EARS the ear piece
and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond almost an abstract
vision

INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

TOMS VOICE
Â»Once again The Libyan Government
has disavowed any prior knowledge of
the flight This has been Tom Grunick
reporting from Washington

The special report ended Jane breathes a breath -- she and
Blair momentarily grasp hands The first talk concerns Tom

PAUL
He was brilliant Ive never been
as proud of one of my decisions

ERNIE
(calls back to Jane)
Great work Jane really -- You know
Really

She nods totally depleted

JANE
Well there were no major gaffs anyway

Ernie scoffs in her direction

JANE
Thanks everybody

She exits the scene

PAUL
(to the Usher brothers)
This was important for Tom -- theres
that bonding thing that happens with
the public and an anchorman during a
crisis Its not the conventions
anymore its this kind of moment

Tom enters He is exuberant

PAUL
(to Tom)
What a baptismal Congratulations

TOM
Thanks With all the help you get
its sure easier than local

Paul and Ernie exchange a glance

TOM (contd)
Wheres Jane Im still juiced

Ernie points off as Tom exits The Usher brothers hover

ERNIE
(to the Usher brothers)
Can I help you

MARVIN

ERNIE
New theme You dont need me for this

PAUL
Stay Why should I be the only one
to feel silly

MAN ONE
We need a synthesizer -- but this
will give you an idea

PAUL
Go ahead
(to Ernie)
Wasnt he great

ERNIE
It worked

Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
news theme a suite meant to have majesty and drive a towering
composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard

INT NEWSROOM - DAY
As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in He

enters Janes cubby flushed with the electricity of the win
the most noteworthy moment of his working life
INT JANES CUBBY - DAY

TOM
Youre an amazing woman What a feeling
having you inside my head

JANE
(a bit thrown)
Yeah It was an unusual place to be

TOM
Indescribable -- you knew just when to
feed me the next thing just a split
second before I needed it There was a
rhythm we got into like great sex

Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
truthfulness

TOM
You have to celebrate with me dont
you Everybodys going to that bar
on the corner Caps

JANE
Im going over to Aarons Maybe Ill
hoop up with all of you later How
long do you think youll be there

Tom indicates that its an impossible question to answer They
enters the elevator

EXT NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

As several people cross the street towards the bar Tom has
been holding back on one question

TOM
Its tempting to ask you how you think
I did
(she starts to reply)
No Im enjoying myself Take it easy
He starts across the street
JANE
(trying to be casual)
Maybe Ill see you over there

Indicates Bar

TOM
Youll never show up

He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her

TOM
Jane

JANE
Yeah

TOM
Ill wait for you till seven

JANE
(shouting back)
Okay
Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant bg

pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction Jane
moving quickly along

SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
through

EXT AARONS APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
stoop outside

ON AARON

Happy to see her rising fairly soberly to his feet He APPLAUDS
as she comes toward him

JANE
Really It was good

He nods and APPLAUDS some more

JANE
Your calling in that information --
youre the classiest guy I know

He waves her off And sits down on the stoop

AARON
It was strange to watch him Whats
the next step Lip synching

She sits a step or two above him waiting to gauge his mood

AARON
Ive been doing some of the most
important thinking of my life I
wonder if this is the right time to
tell you about it

She steals a glance at her watch

JANE
Well whatever you think
AARON
I figured out exactly why it is Im so
hung up on getting a chance at weekend
anchorIts because if I do that well
theyll pay me more treat me great and
my life will be better Thats why

JANE
Sounds like you may be on to something

AARON
Which means Im at their mercy and who
wants thatIm not going to tell
you where this thought led me
Anyway well why not tell you --
its a happy thing In the middle of
all this I start to think about something
that does nothing but make me feel good
and makes immediate sense and thats you
-And Ill stop here but Jane Id give
anything if you were two people so I could
call up the one whos my friend and tell
her about the one Im in II dont think
I should go any further Come on --
Ill walk you to the corner

He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner

JANE
You know youve had a strange day
Id sleep on all these things youve
been thinking

AARON
AbsolutelyYou go have a good time
You have some place to go

JANE
Yes
AARON
Good
He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his

hands and kisses her full on the lips

AARON
Well I felt something

He leaves her on the corner and walks back
ON JANE

As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE
Jane moving quickly hailing a cab

INT CAB - EVENING
JANE

Seventeenth and Vermont
Connecticut is clear on Sunday

As the cab pulls up Jane gets out and pays him

DRIVER

JANE

DRIVER

JANE

As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer
As they confront each other

TOM
I didnt think youd make it

JANE
Well I thought Id check if all

TOM
Theres no gang in there -- We

JANE
Well Ill go in and have a bite

exit
TOM

JENNIFER

(as they move off)
I sure know that feeling Terrific

JANE

(too jock-like)
Right back to you

TOM

Thanks for getting me through

He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
camaraderie She awkwardly disengages waves and steps
inside the door to the restaurant standing there between
the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away

ON TOM AND JENNIFER

As they walk to his car first exchanging a look of reflection
over Jane then bumping accidentally then bumping back a
look then kissing with passion wrapped around each other

INT JENNIFERS APT - NIGHT

As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace shedding
clothes even as they enter

She laughs

JENNIFER

TOM
(stopping her)
It would never occur to me to worry
at all about you

Jennifer is touched

JENNIFER
You know something Im deeply
complimented Isnt it strange to

be deeply complimented because the
man youre with doesnt think you
have a venereal disease

Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
one outstretched hand reaching for his ass a free -- even lusty

sort of motion punctuated by her comment

JENNIFER
Give me some of that

He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action a stupid
grin on his face

TOM
Wheres the bathroom

JENNIFER
Through the closet

He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet

INT CLOSET - NIGHT

It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
shoes extraordinarily well organized Tom stands there agape
Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
luggage
She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
her

JENNIFER

I converted a bedroom -- this
stuff builds up Wait till
youve been doing this sixteen
years

TOM
Im not knocking it Its a
great solution Not only the
storage but you can see everything

you have
Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline

JENNIFER
Do you do bunny rabbits

Tom is enjoying himself immensely

TOM
Isnt this a great date

We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we
INT JANES EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
and SCRATCHING her arm She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
STATESMEN move across the small screen She sighs and without
realizing implores the heavens to help cure a malady shes yet
to recognize in herself

JANE
(to herself)
God help me

People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the bg

AARON
Jesus Jane How long have you
been here

JANE
A long time I was restless
Will you crack my neck

He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings she lets it
ring for a beat as Aaron works on her As she picks up the
receiver we HEAR a CRACK She reacts to it at the same time
she utters a greeting

JANE
Aaah --
(into phone)
-- ello You sure they said the
management meeting
(hangs up then
to Aaron)
They want me to be at the

Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernies desk

TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance As Paul
discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
division Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
her first moment at the seat of power She has the blues

PAUL
Anyway they seem to be very serious

Im doing everything I can Its too
early to make up a death list but I
just wanted you to be aware of the
situation Were also going to cover
the Alaskan serial killer trial ona
continuing basis Id like it done out

Jennifer

The men look at her curiously She repeats herself more
rationally

INT TOMS OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane

Italian embassy

TOM

this kind of buzz around you

TOM
Do I have to stand here in the middle

a little)

He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her Tom is
stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side
TOM

Hi AaronWhats doing
AARON

A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand

TOM
You want to go out there --
(indicating balcony)
get out of this for a second

AARON
Why dont you lead Ill just
follow the flurry you cause

Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him

TOM
What did I do to you

AARON
Youve made my dreams silly

Tom decides not to deal with the remark Hes jolted by the
hostility He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
terrace where Aaron joins him closes the door and the two men
stare at the party

TOM
(gesturing at the
party)
Heavy hitters
Aaron nods
They look inside
AARON

(several beats then)
How you doing

TOM

real life exceeds your dreams

AARON
Keep it to yourself

TOM
You know the other day I really wanted
your reaction to how we did with the
Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
I guess I feel a little intimidated with
you
AARON
Oh stop it

On Toms reaction

AARON
You cant talk about feeling
intimidated when youre on top of
the world Its unseemly

TOM
Im not buying into any of that I
have a load to learn Im not going
to act as if

AARON
(finishing for him)
You have the job you have

The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but its moving too
fast for him

TOM
Shut up a second

AARON
(amiably)
Okay Pretty petty party isnt
it pal
TOM

(picking his words)
I made one rule for myself when this
started and I realized I was going
to take a lot from you people because
of being from sports

AARON
And the rule was

TOM
Never to pretend to know more than
I did

AARON
Can you name all the members of the
Cabinet

TOM

(flustered)

Okay lets drop it I didnt mean

out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor Her
face impossible to read as she studies the screen

ON MONITOR

UNIFORMED COP

aman in and he says they uh had
sex and she says he raped her and
then you find out theyve been out

you prove a crime

NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
of Glass Menagerie

YOUNG WOMAN
It will be a year next month since it
happenedI never thought Id talk
about it outside of counseling

ON NEWSROOM
As Aaron enters the scene

AARON
Hi

He is shushed by every woman in the room accepts this and takes
up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them
ON MONITOR

ON MONITOR

As the news piece cut to Toms face -- he turns clearing a tear
from his eyes

ON NEWSROOM

These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted Aaron

YOUNG WOMAN

Wed gone out twice and I hadnt
enjoyed myself that much but it gets
to a point -- I dont know if you can
appreciate this but where you dont
want to sit home or be with your
girlfriends and people had always been
telling me that I was too picky
Im not Its just you want to meet
a nice guySo anyways it was that
âgive-him-a-chance thing No it
wasnt I was lonely So we went
to a movie and when he brought me home
he said could he just come up and have
one beer and then hed go How do you
say no to that So first it was
this wrestling match which was awful
enough because it got to be really
a fightbecause Im a modest person
then he ripped my clothes and he
forced me tomake love He stayed in
my apartment and forced me more times
-- he didnt leave until

(she has started to cry)
I promised myself I wouldnt cry
Its just hard not to --

(ruefully)
You sure have a sympathetic face

(she cries a bit more)
I was so sure I wouldnt do this --
but the whole thing messed me up --
maybe more than it should

is aghast Aaron approaches the set

AARON
Can I turn on the news for a second
Â»Oh wait a minute Sex -- Tears --

This must be the news

Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the

monitor

ON MONITOR

PUBLIC OFFICIAL
I dont think you can overestimate it --
on any given Saturday night tens of
thousands of women are being attacked
and there isnt much they or we can do
about it

TOM

(on monitor)
The victims often remain too terrified
to talk -- the police powerless and all
the social welfare groups can finally do
is monitor this epidemic of crime without
punishment This is Tom Grunick in
Annandale Virginia

As his piece concludes

Tom continues to glare at Aaron

AARON
Im in a pissy mood Im sorry

TOM

Blair moans with displeasure Aaron exits scene Others start

to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the bg on the

We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps

of people watching them work

Probing her own ambivalence -- or to be more accurate
towards a positive stance

JANE

Nice work

Ive got to get a crew off the clock

She starts off -- Tom stopping her
ON TOM AND JANE
Now off a bit by themselves

cut to yourself when you tear up -- and

that might not have been my choicebut

lot of the time Im too conservative about

AARON
Wait Bullshit me a littleIm

ERNIE
Im no suggesting the worst will
happenbut someone with your
brilliance gets nibbles about other

INT SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT
Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
his hand An unmanned camera is pointing at him Tom

is standing a few feet further back studying him

AARON
This is uncomfortable for me --
because well I dont mean it as
a knock but we approach this
differently

TOM
We sure do I dont mean it as a
knock either
(he smiles)
Go ahead Ill just say what I think
and you can disregard it if you want

AARON
It just might not work for me because
of our different approaches

Tom nods and gestures that he proceed Aaron begins reading
the news Barely a sentence in he is interrupted

TOM
Wait
AARON
What
TOM
Your coat jacket is rising up in
back
Aaron ignores the tip
TOM
When you sit down -- sit on your
jacket a little -- that gives you

a good line Look at yourself in
the monitor

Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news
Tom not about to be ignored when he knows its important moves
behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down

AARON
(very uncomfortable)
I dont like being handled

TOM
Sit on it Now look

AARON
Just dont physically
(he sees himself in the
monitor and is suddenly
enthusiastic)
Fantastic tip -- fantastic

He starts to read again
TOM
No Thats not going to tell us

TOM

Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him clearly taken with the
genuine camaraderie the unmistakable joy Tom derives from
helping out Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in
tow

TOM
I got copy I got Ellen to heat up
the camera and I got Master Control

He puts the roll of copy in the prompter

AARON

Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode Punching the

pads clipped to her bra-straps She is obviously running a little
late Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that

it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
gown the kind good girls wear on special nights The DOORBELL
RINGS She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace
Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
of neckties

AARON

puts it on and ties the tie She reaches into a white paper bag
full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
the mist ON Aarons reaction

JANE

ON AARON

Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN She starts
off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge Both of
them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands

FLOOR MANAGER
Ten seconds

AARON
How many

FLOOR MANAGER
Ten

AARON
Okay
He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens
resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
been denying him for years We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE

in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Managers earphones
with Aaron Altman

AARON

(on TV)
Good EveningIn mood and language
better suited to an espionage novel
than the delicate world of the Western
Alliance the British Foreign Secretary
today pounced on what he termed The
nest of profession spies and amateur
traitors who were turning NATO
Headquarters into an instrument whose
only true function is folly We begin
our coverage with Edward Towne in London

Aaron looks up -- takes a breath Hes done well -- hes
punched his words and his one thought for the story His gaze
has been steady his voice firm but he has begun to perspire

He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip He
beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms

MAKEUP WOMAN
Gee whiz

FLOOR MANAGER

She scurries away Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
box and missing it A graphic illustrating his next scripted
section appears behind him

located in five countries

And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
as they look at a large monitor

AARON

And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat The Makeup
Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself
Aarons eyes dart angrily in her direction

AARON
We well as Great BritainOur own
State Department was rocked not only
by the revelation but from the highly
unusual persistence from the State

the ruckus at Foggy Bottom

Half-beat until hes sure that hes off -- his shirt now
showing distinct sweat stains

better of it

abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
night in our capitol He is still holding her hand -- and
now he notes this

TOM
(loudly to himself)
Why cant I let go of this woman

JANE
Well

He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
air And then he does something hes thought about many times
before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
to look at her

JANE
At least kiss me when you do
that

TOM
(a grin)
You just cant stop editing me
Huh

JANE
This is hysterical

She laughs a little -- then kisses him They break --
surprised and aroused and look at each other

JANE
I was half hoping I wouldnt
have a good time tonight You
know why

TOM
Because youre nuts

JANE
Right right -- Isnt she fun to

tease

He leans forward and speaks softly and truly

TOM
More and more lately when Ive
watched you in action -- seen all

your energy -- Ive been
wondering what it would be like
to be inside all that energy

She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
on her own cheek Then turns to him

JANE
Right back at you

Several beats

TOM
I dont remember saying anything
like that -- exactlyI dont

know why I just did

JANE
(immediately at work)
Oh lets see -- wait a minute well

ThreeI just thought of a third
If you talk about it you dont have
to do it

TOM

You know intimacy

She elbows him Tom takes in the choices -- then

JANE
(suddenly)
Oh shit Im a creep

She moves off the concrete wall

JANE
I forgot all about Aaron I
promised to stop by and see
how he did
TOM

She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command the first time any

of his actions has been tinged with fury

TOM
JANE

Thrown she stops and turns He walks to her

JANE
What happened

TOM
Dont run off -- like everythings

mind

JANE
He might be weird -- he can talk more
freely if I go alone -- whys that so

hard to understand

TOM

to give me a minute to catch up

JANE
Okay

Sorry
(another beat)

of your shoulder pads -- how was

one aware of it
AARON
People phoned in

JANE
Stop kidding I want to know

AARON
Im not kidding

JANE
There were complaining phone calls
because you were sweating

AARON
No nice ones worried that I was
having a heart attack

JANE
If all that happened how come youre
so chipper

AARON
I dont know At a certain point
it was so off the chart bad --
it got funny My central nervous
system was telling me something

Jane -- sweat running down my face --
makeup falling into my eyes -- people
turning this fusillade of blow dryers
on me -- all so I could read

introductions to other people who
were covering stories which is
what I like to do anyway And Im
chipper because you finally showed
up I thought Id cook for us
Tequila and eggs sound good

JANE
I have to be somewhere

He looks at a clock reading 115 in the morning
JANE

I told whats his name -- Tom --
that Id meet him

AARON
Call him -- I mean it can wait
right

JANE

(now the plunge)
I dont know I may be in love
with him

AARON
(as if he just burned
his hand)

She starts for the door

AARON
Dont go

JANE
This is important to me

AARON
Yeah WellI think it is
important for you too Sit down

She sits He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly Silence
JANE
What
AARON

(looking at her)
Let me think a second Its
tough

A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders she takes stock
it is evident that he is straining to get it right reaching
into himself

AARON

AaachJane

(glancing at note)
Lets take the part that has
nothing to do with me Lets let
me be your most trusted friend
the one that gets to say awful
things to you You know

JANE
(testy and wary
but fair)
Yes I guess Yes

AARON
You cant end up with Tom because
it goes totally against everything

JANE
Yeah -- being a basket case

AARON
I know you care about him Ive
never seen you like this about

ll get a job where

he influences a great God-fearing

nation and he wil

l never do an evil

thinghe will just bit by little bit
lower standards where they are important
Just coax along flash over substance
Just a tiny bit And he will talk about
all of us really being salesmen

(seeing hes not

reaching her)
And hell get all the great women

She is getting pissed

JANE
I think youre the Devil

AARON

No You know that Im not
JANE

How
AARON

Because we have the kind of
relationship where if I were the
Devil youd be the only one I
told

Shes briefly impressed He has a point

JANE
You were quick enough to get
Toms help when

AARON
Yes yes I know Right And
if it had gone well for me tonight
maybe Id be keeping quiet about all
thisI grant you everything but
give me thishe does personify
everything youve been fighting
againstAnd Im in love with you
(realizing)

How do you like that -- I buried
the lead
He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
nose
AARON
(an aside)
Ive got to not say that aloud
it takes too much out of me
JANE
(thawing)
Sit down stop
Aaron slumps down -- its been a long round
AARON

Ive never fought for anyone before
Does anybody win one of these things

provoking

Paul arriving with Bill Rorish The first time we have seen
the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh He has the grace
and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
grace and dignity
He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
muted and ominous

BILL
Just when do you start telling people

PAUL
Almost immediately

BILL
Id like to take everyone out after

But I think its extraordinary of
you to come down here for this

BILL
If were not here for each other
during the tough time were not a
news organization

Blair ENTERS scene The smallest flicker of interest from Bill
but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
outfit

BLAIR
Welcome back to Washington

BILL
Thanks

A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and shes gone

BILL
Ive forgotten Was she on the list

Paul nods yes

BILL
This is a brutal layoffAnd all
because they couldnt program Wednesdays

PAUL
(cant resist)
You can make it a little less brutal
by knocking a million dollars or so off
your salary

AS Bill turns

PAUL
Just a bad joke Im sorry Awful
Its a miserable day and that was
some kind of totally sick-joke
defense mechanism which does not
indicate any of my feelings -- not
one -- but just shows the kind of
stress this represents for all of us

walks to Tom

BILL

stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
of resolution to their confrontation is palpable

may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old

TOM
when they told me Bill had decided
to retire and offered me the Evening
News I thought it was the same kind
of joke we used to pull back at the
station -- turning off somebodys
prompter in the middle of a show

Some good-natured laughter

TOM (contd)
And then when they heard my reaction --
they thought I was kidding I told them
Id be their anchor but I didnt want
to be the Managing Editor -- that there
were people better qualified than I to
control the content and if there
werent we were all in trouble

The audience really enjoys this
