GONE IN 60 SECONDS

IT wonder Toad said to himself presently I wonder
if this sort of car starts easily

Next moment hardly knowing how it came about he
found that he had hold of the handle and was turning
it As the familiar sound broke forth the old
passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him
body and soul He increased his pace and as the
car devoured the street he was only conscious
that he was Toad once more Toad at his best and
highest And he sped he knew not whither fulfilling
his instincts living his hour reckless of what
might come to him

All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty
hood

-- Bruce Springsteen THUNDER ROAD

FADE IN
EXT LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT

The streets are empty Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray

stew

of a sky Its slightly fuzzy slightly surreal The vast Port
of Los

Angeles is visible in the bg No cars parked here No
cars

except â€”-

A 67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500
Silver with deep grill its sculptured side panels ending in

air

scoops All cock and balls it stands alone in the lonely
cool

before dawn An old-school totem to speed and style And
then

SOMEONE approaches

Through the mists of morning In leather coat and jack boots

Hes early 30s with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a
shimmer

that refuses to fade

This is RANDALL RAINES whom they call MEMPHIS - though know

ones
quite sure why But they do know hes the auto-boost in
Southern
California
Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe Like a
desert
crash survivor coming upon an oasis He walks around it
Admiring it Adoring it
But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him Its driver -
ATLEY JACKSON early 30s handsome jocular leans out for
ATLEY JACKSON
You gonna steal her or kneel down to
her and pray --
Memphis looks at him still enthralled
ATLEY JACKSON (contd)
I know I know Its Eleanor
Just take her slick - -
And Atley drives off slowly Memphis looks this way and that
No one about He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in
his
coat He slims the door panel Pops the button opens
the
door

Watch him work Quick as shit A SCREWDRIVER appears another
pocket He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

A RATCHET appears He strips the mechanism Now a GIZMO -
asmall
socket-like device - is pressed into the

ignition A twist of the wrist And the 320-bhp 289 V8
rumbles

like a jackhammer The whole thing took 20 seconds

He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket Slaps it into
the

deck Bruce Springsteens Ramrod wails from the coaxials

And Memphis floors it And off they tear

The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction A
grand

re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers A speed
Jones

fixed and fumy

He slots in behind Atley Jacksons Firebird And slotting in
behind Memphis in a Z-28 is DONNY ASTRICKY mid-30s

On they go The fore and aft car providing escort

Except that from seemingly out of nowhere --

A POLICE CAR

appears behind them

And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic He races

through a STOP SIGN And the cruisers bubbles flash on
And

Donny is pulled-over Atley and Memphis drive on in their
respective vehicles

The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car goes to Donny

DONNY
Problem Officer

POLICEMAN
Yes Youre under arrest --

DONNY
For running a stop sign

POLICEMAN
For Grand Theft Auto -

And off of Donnys look --
We go to Memphis in the Shelby As FOUR CRUISERS comes

speeding
toward him sirens wailing
QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early
morning

harbor town streets Sirens peel Memphis turns up the

music
Pins the gas The chase is on

Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb Memphis

gutterballing the car skating the shoulder the cops in heavy

pursuit

And now hes picked up another CRUISER He passes Atley
Jackson

heading in the opposite direction Atley has picked-up a pair
of

cruisers himself

Memphis on a straightaway now speeds up feels the boost But
up

ahead a ROADBLOCK has formed Howd they get that deployed
so

fast And behind him the unmarks blaze

Guns his bitch Straight at the roadblock Three CRUISERS
and

a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE Memphis pins her ZOOOO0OM
Dead-on

to the roadblock

And at the last moment as the COPS dive out of the way
Memphis
bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --
And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin
And
Memphis takes the HARD LEFT

And hes managed to outrun them Finding himself above Lower
Grand Looking down
He can see the secondary pursuit down below Atley being

chased IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE
SHOULDER
the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert

Landing with a sickening thud on its back Memphis is
horrified

EXT LOWER GRAND - LATER

Rescue team presence Atley being hauled out of the wreck
His

leg is a torn mess Hes barely conscious A cuffed Donny
Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser
A POLICE CAR pulls up And out steps
DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK

Castlebeck

is mid-50s black saturnine - But dont let the tacit
nobility

Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS

HAWKINGS
Astricky And Jackson No sign of
Raines

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
Well then its all for naught
aint it Hawkings

Castlebeck looks out over the mess And then looks up
Because further down Lower Grand a car is parked It is the

Shelby With Memphis leaning against its hood

Castlebeck looks around him but no ones noticed So he walks
toward it hand on hip

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I know you --

MEMPHIS
You know my back -

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
You want to come along quiet

MEMPHIS
Hows Atley --

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
Legs all banged-up He made a

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

And they stare at each other as Castlebeck considers

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (contd)
I do this And I see you again Ill
come after you with everything I got
you wont be able to steal a glance
at a blind man without me by your side

MEMPHIS
You have my word

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
Get out of here then Now

And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
Leave the car Randall

Memphis nods Takes one last look at the Shelby Sorry to
leave it behind And he runs off into the mists of Lower
Grand

Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
Arright let lim go Cite him for
rolling the stop And cite old
Atley for driving to endanger

HAWKINGS
What are you talking about Rollie Were
springing em Just like that

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
Just like that Quit your bellyaching
Hawkings And lets wrap this up

And off of Donnys surprised look as Springsteen wails to
crescendo and we

INT CALITRIS WORKSHOP

Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors He looks at

Atley

ATLEY JACKSON
Car-jacker Neglected to clean up after
himself

MEMPHIS
Jesus

ATLEY JACKSON
The business has changed

Calitri is back wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag

CALITRI
Now Where were we Oh yes Kip

MEMPHIS
I dont want him hurt

Calitri looks at him then waves a hand around the shop

CALITRI
Im proud of this work The bird
feeder The wagon wheel planter
The dollhouse The drop-leaf movable
server

He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork

gestures to the yard

CALITRI (contd)
Metal Steel Its cold Ugly Wood
is warm Clean Provided by nature
To see a piece of furniture take shape
Its like watching a child grow

Memphis glances to Atley Atley shrugs

MEMPHIS

Then
Im sure youre working your way to
the point Ill wait right here

Calitri blinks Smiles Nods

CALITRI
My point Yes Simple really I require
the best I insist on the best I only
engage the best Your brother His
friends They came to me They wanted my
paper He was your brother You were the
best Now Theyve brought so much
goddamn heat down I may not be able to
fill this order Which would be very bad
for me Which in turn is very bad for
them

MEMPHIS
I could kill you That occurred to me
When I first heard about this That I
would kill you

CALITRI
Grow up You dont kill people like me
People like me die in their sleep at
87 Do you know why Because if
you did kill me and everyone knew it
was you - for the next ten years theyd
be finding pieces of those you love
scattered all over California

Memphis nods notes a PISTOL resting on a shelf nearby

CALITRI (contd)
No no You dont kill me because
you cant You dont take your brother
and run because wed find him You
dont go to the-police because we have
friends there too You do nothing
except deal with me

Memphis eyes him

MEMPHIS
I can come up with the front money
Pay you back

CALITRI
Were it only that easy I have
obligations The order needs to be
filled
Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk Hands it to
Memphis who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside

CALITRI (contd)
On that list youll find fifty cars
Fifty Five-zero They range in
age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird
to the 1999 Toyota Camry and in
expense from the 1993 Volkswagen
Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini
Countach Fifty cars Five-zero

Memphis scans the list Looks up at Calitri

CALITRI (contd)
There is a container ship in Long
Beach Harbor Pier 14 Ready to be
loaded with 4-car-per shipping
containers false-walled and
customsprofiled as motor oil
designated The ship leaves in four
days for South America and the
men whove tendered me this contract

MEMPHIS
They gave you only four days

CALITRI
They gave me two weeks I wasted most of it
with your brother and his crew who not
only lost what pitiful few they managed
to boost but also alerted the heat as to our
endeavor making this even more difficult
to achieve

Memphis scans the list

CALITRI (contd)
Four days 50 cars Im paying 200
thousand dollars

Now Memphis looks up

MEMPHIS
Im not interested --

CALITRI
I knew youd say that

MEMPHIS
Im just here about my brother
CALITRI
I knew youd say that too --

Calitri smiles Memphis looks at him

the trap

MEMPHIS
Sound it out for me

CALITRI
Your brother has four days Fifty
cars Five-zero For that he gets
200 large

MEMPHIS
And if he doesnt make it --

Calitri goes to one corner of the shop

CALITRI

Memphis waits knowing where this is going --

MEMPHIS

Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut

for a mellow olive -

And they nibble on them Kip bites into one And the juice
stings his cracked lip But he disguises his grimace as an
appreciative nod

And for a moment they nibble olives and drop pits into an
ashtray Then

through

Am I dying Are all the angels of my life
returning to bid a final farewell

Hello Memphis -

OTTO
Whatever do you mean

cars The rolled-back odometers The
part bins

OTTO

What happened Old-age happened I tired of
illing them I woke up one morning and thought
I am no longer a destroyer I am a means of
resurrection Now We restore We revive

There are so few things in this life we can
prevent from decay Most must die These dont
have to

hope Kips jerk-circus didnt undo
Castlebecks linkage so much so
that hes setting up surveillance
teams on every city block And
then get yourself a crew

The hard part

OTTO
A people is a detour of nature to
get 6 or 7 great men - Yes and then
to get around them Nietzsche said
that

Is he still working here

OTTO
The old crew Go find them I cant
help you with that Since Ive cleaned

Otto has finished the Camaro He looks at Memphis --

OTTO
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal
worst car ever built Value job
Everything broke and I-fixed it
A coma car - built to German specs
Plastic gas line 3 speedometer head
On a quiet night you could hear it
rusting in the garage But when that
car was gone I missed it If it came
driving back in here right now
thered be tears and laughter

A SHOT GLASS slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK Ina
mariner saloon Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES
Sawdust on the floor Broken beer mirrors A rough joint

DRUNK

The BARTENDER comes over She is a dark-haired heavily
tattooed GIRL 26 with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy

Orbison
song Her name is Sara Wayland And she goes by SWAY She

collects the Drunks empty glass

SWAY

DRUNK

Gimme another --
SWAY

a head-start on waking up in a pool
of your own vomit

DRUNK
Listen you little cooze--

And the Drunk reaches out across the bar to grab a bottle And

Sway grabs his hand twists it The Drunk groans in agony
And Sway still clutching his hand hops over the bar And
drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front Cries of
Attagirl Sway pepper the air
EXT THE NAUTICAL MILE - NIGHT
Sway tosses him The Drunk hitting the pavement

SWAY

Come back when youve learned how to
drink Billy --

And she freezes Because standing there is Memphis She
looks at him Shocked is a good place to start

into

his

and

And Memphis is on him They go rolling about in grunts and
groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table

drowning out the sounds of combat
Calitri is on top grabbing an AWL from the floor bringing the
lethal point down to Memphis face Memphis holds Calitris

wrist straining the point inches from his eye

ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis head With a last
gasp Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET -

small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies as they
akimbo
Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts
out inside of them Calitri is up and hes found the gun

He crawls over to Memphis climbing on him sitting down hard

the younger mans chest But then Memphis grabs him by the
and tosses Calitri off him Memphis POUNDS Calitris head
the floor

Once twice Three times Calitri is out Memphis gets to

feet nose bloody He catches his breath Only the door opens
And Atley is there

ATLEY JACKSON

Jesus man Whatd you do

MEMPHIS
My version of take this job and shove
it

ATLEY JACKSON
Are you crazy You throw down with The
Carpenter You got a grudge against
your life

But before Memphis can respond there are APPROACHING ENGINE
SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives Memphis

Atley look at the wall-clock 805 A glance to the unconscious
Calitri
ATLEY JACKSON (contd)
Now you done it And with you
gone - wholl save Kip the next
time

MEMPHIS
This is all about there not being
a next time Atley --

And the two men hold the look And the van doors slam as
Digger

and Butz Calitris grave-diggers get out Atley goes to
the

unconscious Calitri And he picks him up straining under
the

dead weight Dragging the don over to

THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops

Calitri into the casket Slamming the swell top lid of the
coffin He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger
and
Butz are there -
ATLEY JACKSON
Hello boys --
DIGGER
Hey What happened Did they make it
ATLEY JACKSON

DIGGER

ATLEY JACKSON

Atley gestures to the coffin And they pick it up move it to
the
van
DIGGER

And they are gone And Atley turns to Memphis

ATLEY JACKSON

MIRROR MAN

Poor Toby man
A few beats of silence as they remember then shockingly

THE SPHINX
If his premature demise has in some way
enlightened the rest of you as to the
grim finish below the glossy veneer of
criminal life and inspired you to change
your ways then his death carries with it
an inherent nobility And a supreme
glory We should all be so fortunate
You can say Poor Toby I say Poor us

They all stare at him stunned

FREB
You spoke

The Sphinx shrugs

TUMBLER
Say something else man

But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence Nibbles a donut
Sips coffee Memphis smiles He takes a stack of
bills
from the briefcase To Kip
