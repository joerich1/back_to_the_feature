Soldiers in battle dress with subd-machine guns are
posted by its doors and stand in groups about the
tarmac On the edges of the field anti-aircrait gms

of a KLM 707 which has just landed

Ac the foot of the gangway two more soldiers with
sten gims watch the passengers 2s they descend the
steps and the Europeans blink back at them with
some uneasiness The faint menacing tempo of
Indonesian gamelan music drifcs through he heavy
night air

GUY BAMILTON moves down the gangway a tape recorder
slung over his shoulder Unlike most of his fellow
passengers he is clearly not intimidated by the guards
Most of the passengers head for the tremsit lounge
