Oxford Book Of Mystical Verse

FADE IN
THE MOON So fat and full in the night sky you can reach out
and touch it

HICKS W 0

This is whats known There has always

been manand there have always been

vampires

BLACK SHAPES swoop past the moonscape vicious looking

things

Much shrieking and wailing

Atop a STONE ZIGGURAT -- We see a GROUP OF MEN -- AZTEC

WARRIORS readying themselves with PRIMITIVE WEAPONS --

SLINGS BOWS SPEARS Tonight they know they will die

HICKS (CONTD)

Since the beginning -- the two have been

locked forever in combat The vampires

were quicker stronger and had the gift

of flight

Quick glimpses of a bloody brutal battle Men screaming

Talons ripping FIERY ARROWS launched against an unseen
enemy

WHOOSH

With a HOWL we see A MAN plucked off the ground his body

disappearing in the night THE IMAGE DISSOLVES as -- the sky

turns bright the moon becoming a familiar ball of yellow
gas

HICKS (CONTD)
metal

WASP

But man had the sun
THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find another GROUP OF MEN -- more
sophisticated than the first Makeshift weapons made of

and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight
They stand before AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE looks like a GIANT

NEST Unsheathing their weapons they step grimly inside
We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel

HXCKS (V0) (CONTD)

And so it went like this over many years

As man and vampire both evolved -- the

wars became bloodier

From afar we see GIANT STACKS OF CORPSES as hydraulic
machines stack the black bodies into pyres as big as
buildings smoke rising to the sky in twisting columns

A LONE MAN

Stands at the base of one of the mammoth pyres Even from
this angle we sens e his quiet dignity

HICKS (V0) (CONTD)

Then came THE PRIESTS --

The Man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large
CROSS TATTOO cutting across his eyes and down the center

HICKS (V0) (CONTD)

-- Specially trained warriors in the art

of vampire combat They single-handedly

turned the tide for the humans
Quick glimpses of a GROUP OF PRIESTS battling a FURY OF
VAMPIRES (we still do not get a good look at them) Their
technique is otherworldy -- combining the brutality of a
Maori Warrior with the grace of a Samurai

The--combat-is intense Glorious An explosion of blood and
sbmil

HICKS (V0) (CONTD)

Over time the vampire threat faded The
once fierce race now fatally diminished
A shadow of what they once were
Through heavy smoke we see a pile of VAMPIRE CORPSES a
ragged collection of fangs and claws

HICKS (V0) (CONTD)

The remaining vampires were put Into

camps and -- by decree of the High

Clergy the Priests disbanded The

former warriors to be integrated as

members of regular society

We see a WAX SEAL pressed onto an ancient parchment The
document carefully rolled and stored in an ORNATE CHAMBER

HICKS (V0) (CONTD)

The human race thrived in relative
quiet The vampire menace quickly
forgotten for other more modern
threats

(BEAT)
And the few surviving Priests faded Into
quiet obscurity
The chamber is closed We see an encrusted key turning ina
heavy set lock and we --

FADE TO BLACK

S
Our story begins with the rusty SCRAPE of a windmill

FADE IN
EXT THE WASTELAND - DAY

Dust swirls in nasty tangles

A LONE MALE FIGURE moves across the plain long and lean in

overalls AARON PACE Shadows flicker across his sunburned

face the windmill looming above him

in his hands is an ELECTRONIC DEVICE he plunges it into the

earth It makes a series of CLICKING SOUNDS reading the
soil

Aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a WOMAN standing in

the doorway of his CABIN

He smiles waving to her His wife

INT OUTPOST 10 (NURSERY) - DUSK
from

hes

A pioneers wood cabin

Aaron sits surrounded a lattice work of vines covering the
walls and floors in beautiful patterns Not a trace of soil
anywhere in the room everything hydroponically grown

SHANNON (0S)
Suppers on
He smiles studying a stunning RUBY RED FLOWER separate

the others His crown jewel He closes the door and enters -

THE KITCHEN
SHANNON PACE carries a bowl filled with a steaming green
broth placing it on the dinner table moving aside a tiny
FIGURINE OF JESUS The surrounding furniture cluttered with
religious knickknacks

SHANNON (CONTD)
You been spending an awful lot of time
behind that door Makes a woman
suspicious

AARON
Special project Its taking a little
more time than I thought

SHANNON
Nothing special about milkweed Unless
you like a thorn in the finger

I AARON
Its not Milkweed Not this year

SHANNON
What is it
AARON
Youll see
His eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss -- but
INTERRUPTED BY

LUCY (0S)

Yuck Pershing-stew again

Their DAUGHTER Already a heartbreaker This girl is
too young too pretty to be out here in the badlands

LUCY (CONTD)
I cant do it anymore This outpost

AARON
Honeywe know this hasnt been easy for

the soil and thisll be their outpost
But for right now -- this is my job

LUCY

I dont know what its like to have a
best friend To have any friends I
want to have a crush I want secrets

(SIMPLY)
I want a life
Shannon looks at her husband She knew this day would come

SHANNON
Aaron Shes thirteen -- She should be
with children her own age
Aaron lets out a breath

AARON
Okay Next year well figure out a way
to get you to a school close by In

LUCY

BUT
AARON

for you to have a crush
Lucy deflates knowing this is as good as its going to get
for awhile Aaron takes her hand

AARON (CONTD)
Tomorrow Im heading in town to file

(BEAT)
Now cmon stews getting cold Bow your

The family clasps hands Whatever their differences theres
a bond here

LUCY
Dear Lord we thank you for what we are
about to receive Blessing us with your
gifts
Shespeaks with her eyes clenched shut words spoken
sincerely nothing perfunctory about it Shes a believer

LUCY (CONTD)
We thank you for the earth and the sky and
for your bounty through Christ our Lord --
Shestops opening her eyes -- staring at the plates and
glasses on the table
Theyre RATTLING

LU C Y (CONTD)
Daddy

AA RON
Shh
He cocks his ear heading a low rumble
Although hes never heard the sound beforehe knows it

can

only mean one thing

Trying to remain calm Aaron goes to the window

OUT THE WINDOW

Framed by a BLOOD MOON hanging over the horizon a DOZEN
BLACK

MOTORCYCLES race across the plain ENGINES thundering

The Jesus figurine falls off the table SHATTERING to the
floor

Aaron looks at Shannon an expression on his face she hasnt
seen before -

AARON (CONTD)
Get the boards)

LUCY

(ALARMED )
Whats going on
Aaron doesnt answer Shannon helping him position pre-cut
planks across every window and door Each with an iron-cross
strut for support

EXT OUTPOST 10 - SAME
The CYCLES circle the house kicking up dust in sheets
INT OUTPOST 10 - SAME

The ROAR of the engines fills the house as Aaron pulls a
POWERFUL LOOKING GUN from the drawer He drops it obviously
not familiar with firearms

AARON
Get by me
Shannon-and Lucy crouch at his feet

EXT OUTPOST 10 - SAME

The cycles cut their engines headlights centered on the
house A blistering spotlight
Its quiet
The RIDERS step from their machines We dont get a look at
their faces as one by one they LEAP onto the house and
windmill SKITTERING across the walls and roof like spiders
The blades of the windmill slowly come to a stop
11U OUTPOST 10 r- SAME
The power goes out everything going black

fade

We hear the Riders crawling over the outside of the house
Snarling howling making terrifying sounds

Then the worst sound of all Wood being torn apart

BLAM BLAN Aaron SHOOTS like crazy the white light MUZZLE
FLASHES providing glimpses of SHAPES moving inside the

BLACK BODIES blown back Shrieking Everything happening
lightening fast

Finally the gun clicks empty and were plunged back into
darkness

THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON
Aaron is still standing the house in shambles around him
Hes alone

AARON

SHANNON
From outside we hear the cycles revving
Aaron runs to the door Rips off the board in time to see --

EXT OUTPOST 10 - SAME

The motorcycles racing away a cloud of dust in their wake
Aaron runs after but TRIPS on --

SHANNON
Her body lying in the dirt head lurching at an obscene
angle He brushes back her hair --
ere g UNCTURE MABKS in hem neck
Crying he cradles his wife Feverishly looking around for

AARON

Lucy
He keeps screaming but its no use -- as the-motorcycles

in the night he knows --

Theyve taken her

The CAMERA TILTS to the MOON hanging above the plain it
turns BLACK as we now find ourselves peering into --

EXT CITY FIVEDISTRICT TWELVE - DUSK

The lip of an ENORMOUS SMOKESTACK One of hundreds A
seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with
soot and ash while below miles of FACTORIES stretch and
stretch

A STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS
Quitting time Hundreds of WORKERS trail listlessly from a
massive brick and stone COMPLEX Grey faces betraying

another days toll

A TATTOOED FIGURE
moves through the crowd people stepping out of his way
They do this not out of respect but fear

We dont get a good look at him Just FLASHES --

Shaved head

Eyes like nail guns
Tendons clenching over muscle

As he walkspeople whisper He hears all of it

He heads into the streets CITIZENS hurry by some with
surgical masks over their mouths Theres a pale sickliness
to them Malignant
The Figure suddenly stops He cocks his bald head --
Somethings caught his attention

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

We move through trash and shadow finding --
A gang of FACTORY WORKERS uniformed surrounding a GIRL Their LEADER holds her close BUTCHER KNIFE at her
throat Mouth at her ear

LEADER
Go ahead scream

(SMILES)
Scream for daddy
He hears a noise looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE standing at
the head of the alley
LEADER (CONTD)
Looks like daddys already here
(points the knife)
Well then Come on daddymake it
better
The Figure steps into a pool of white light giving us our
first good look at him --
A LAL RGE AK CROSS TATTOO shadows most of his-- a e Across
the eyes and down the center
The Mark Of The Priest

LEADER (CONTD)

(LAUGHS)
A Priest Well lookie here We got us
a real life war-hero boysl Heard you
guys were real baddasses
The Workers all pull out large knives

LEADER (CONTD)

Guess well find out

They move in on Priest chemicals burning in their blood
mouths leering

Priest folds his hands into the prayer position

The Workers look at each other Laugh

WORKER 1-
Whats he gonna do BLESS us to death
VOOMI -- Theres a whirling SNARL of sound -- the sonic

equivalent of a back flip and --

Pries is holding their knives

Before they can react he throws the knives into their feet
They HOWL pinned to the concrete

Scared the leader clutches the girl pressing against the
brick wall as Priest moves towards him

LEADER
This aint the war no more You got no
right meddlin

(BEAT)
You dont belong here -- You aint one of
from

us

And with that he RAISES the blade to the girls throat --

Cc
WHOOSHI A sudden RUSH OF AIR The leader looks at the
girls neck his blades gone
So is his hand
Priest holds the severed limb its fingers still clutching
the blade The Leader collapses a Holy Shitl expression
frozen on his face

THE GIRL
Gawks at Priest possibly more frightened of him than the
workers
He turns to her wanting to comfort her but not knowing how

She flinches and runs away disappearing into the street
A BEAT as Priest pries the butcher blade from the hand
wiping it off Tucks it in his waistband

He moves on

EXT CHURCH (ESTABLISHING) - NIGHT

Gone to seed The once proud house of God now a sad
collection of moldering stone and cracked stained glass

INT CHURCH

PUSH past row after row of empty pews
We stop on the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH -- a foot sticking out

the door --

INSIDE THE BOOTH

FATHER KOEPPEN body skinny and ravaged The old man pours
himself a drink and downs it Coughing

The confessional door opens someone steps inside the other
booth We cant see who it is

FIGURE
Bless me Father for I have
sinnedagain
The voice is like gravel from the bottom of a deep well
Quietly commanding Koeppen knows it well

KOEPPEN
I caught the ambulance picking up what
was left of the factory boysfigured it
was your handywork
The Shape leans forward we see it is Priest

PRIEST
This time there was a little girl

KOEPPEN
if this keeps occurring itll be
impossible to keep it from the Clergy
Youll get us both excommunicated
Priest gazes into the vestibule his voice almost a whisper

PRIEST
I want to see the other Priests

KOEPPEN
You know you cant The Clergy forbids it

PRIEST
Why

KOEPPEN
They have their reasons
Priest flicks his eyes over Koeppen as if he could see
through the vestibule but his expression doesnt change

PRIEST
And their reasons for building more and
more factories The sky is turning black

KOEPPEN
Since when is industriousness a sin Did
Jesus not teach us to be productive

(BEAT)
As your appointed counselor take my
advice Relax -- Take up a hobby pick a
vice Make friends

PRIEST
Youre my friend

KOEPPEN
Im a wicked old man whod sell his
parish for a pint of whiskey
Priest seems to deflate his hard shell cracking

PRIEST
I dont know whats happening to me (7
Questions Doubts Im not sure what it
is
Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to
face

KOEPPEN
The devil comes in many shapes
Do yourself a favor keep your head
down Be smart And most of all
remember your oath
He hands Priest a set of ROSARY BEADS

KOEPPEN (CONTD)
To go against the Church is to go
against God
This statement has always been the boilerplate of Priests
existence -- but tonight it Just sounds like empty dogma
He
squeezes his eyes shut clutching therosary as we CUT TO

INT LOBBY OF TENAMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Garbage litters the floor The sound of water dripping
Priest stands waiting for the lift to arrive

A BOY AND HIS MOTHER wait too The boy stares at Priest
fascinated his mother doing her best to pretend not to
notice him

The elevator arrives and they step inside
tattoo

INT LIFT - MOMENTS LATER

As it rises a single bulb flickers above Buzzing
The boy continues to stare at Priest bewitched by the

BOY

(TO PRIEST)
Did it hurt
The lift grinds to a stop The mother quickly pulls her son
out as the door rolls open glaring at Priest disappearing
down a dark corridor
And only now does Priest answer

PRIEST

(SOFTLY)
Yes
The lift door clatters shut

CUT TO
INT PRIESTS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sparse containing only whats needed

Priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old
battle scars -- Punctures Scratches Bite marks His skin
showing the early signs of aging

He goes to the lone decoration in his apartment --

A FADED PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY

He takes the picture off the wall studying it The image
bringing him peace

From the streets below the sound of a GUNSHOT

He looks at the rosary beads still in his hand

He turns out the light

Cut TO

Priest takes the card the man writing up a receipt

INT PRIESTS APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Priest goes to a WOODEN BOX feeding the punch card into it

A Rube Goldberg-like device of PULLEYS and WINCHES squeaks

His hand curls into a fist

At the Cities center a municipal of baroque BASILICAS AND
»CHURCHES -- all safely walled off from the rest of the
metropolis

INT CLERGY CHAMBER - NIGHT

Giant shafts of moonlight hit a marbled floor

Priest and Father Koeppen are led by FOUR OFFICERS before A
TRIBUNAL OF MONSIGNORS (all at least in their 70s) They
sit behind a giant table cloaked in the florid robes of

religion Men of scripture creed and doctrine
Priest kneels bowing his head

PRIEST
Thank you for meeting with me on such
short notice Monsignors
Even the Monsignors are uneasyaround Priest Their leader
ORELAS leans forward addressing him

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
Father Koeppen notified us of the
situation Our prayers are with your
family

PRIEST
I come before you because I would like my
authority to be reinstated

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
On what grounds
Priest is taken aback

PRIEST
Shes my blood Monsignor

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
The proper authorities are handling the
situation Im sure theylldo a fine job

PRIEST
The proper authorities
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
All occurrences of vampire disobedience
and felonies are strictly a Federal
matter now

(BEAT)
You Priests did too good a job The
vampire population is classified as
endangered Theyre protected

PRIEST
But Monsignorthey are the enemy

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
Werethe enemy The war ended a long
time ago

PRIEST
Not so long that we should forget what
they are capable of

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
You would do well to remember the words
of our Savior Turn the other cheek
Embrace your enemies

(BEAT)
It is not our place to interfere --- or
yours
Priest looks up obviously in great turmoil

PRIEST-
I can be ofgreat service to the
investigation I -can

0 The tribunal shifts uncomfortably intimidated by Priest
Orelas stands

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
You forget yourself Priest
It has been brought to our attention that
you have engaged in a number of
transgressions Tell medo you feel
yourself to be above God

PRIEST
No Monsignor

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
Engaging in any kind of practice is
sacrilege -- You bring shame upon our
house
Priest turns the full force of his gaze on him

PRIEST
Let your light shine before men that
they may see your good works and glorify
your Father which is in Heaven --

MATTHEW 516

Ae¢
The Monsignor POUNDS the table

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
You dare quote scripture to met
Questioning the authority of the Clergy
is forbiddenl If you engage in another
transgressionyou will be stripped from
the Order and excommunicated immediately
Do I make myself clear

PRIEST
Yes sir

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
I said do I make myself clear Father

PRIEST
Yes Monsignor

MONSIGNOR ORELAS
Youre a soldier Gods soldier-- Act
like one

Remember your vow To go against the
Church is to go against God

The officers start to lead Priest and Koeppen out the

EXT SOUP KITCHEN - ESTABLISHING

HOMELESS stand single file wrapped around the corner black
flakes of ash drifting down as they await tonights supper

INT SOUP KITCHEN - NIGHT

Priest sits alone rosary beads clutched in his hands He
looks up to find Koeppen the old man staggering as he downs
an EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY three sheets to the wind

KOEPPEN
I knew Id find you here
He sits pouring himself another drink toasting the poor
souls at the surrounding tables

KOEPPEN (CONTD)

How many nights in this very spot You

with your endless questions on the nature

of suffering-Me with none of the

answers

Priest doesnt even acknowledge him lost in his thoughts

KOEPPEN (CONTD)
Well now Im the one with a question
This ones a riddle

(BEAT)
What is greater than God-but more evil
than the Devil The poor have it the
rich need it -- and if you eat
ityoull die
Priest looks up his eyes cold

PRIEST
Why wont they listen to me
A beat Koeppen takes another drink
body

KOEPPEN
Okay Im going togive you one more
riddle and if you listen close - you might
just hear an answer to your question
(clears his throat)

(MORE )

KOEPPEN (CONTD)
How can a man who spent his whole life
searching for devils miss the ones
staring him in the face
From behind a CLICKING sound
Priest turns to find an OFFICER standing LASER-GUIDED
SHOTGUN pointed at him The soup kitchen suddenly deathly
quiet

KOEPPEN (CONTD)
The Church feels its better to keep you
under its careat least until this
trouble with your niece blows over

PRIEST
You know I cant do that

KOEPPEN
Thats what I figured

TEN TROOPERS IN FULL RIOT GEAR STORM IN
Jackboots CLACKING they form a circle around Priest and
Koeppen Guns SNAP into place laser points dotting his

Priest looks at Koeppen -- betrayed
PRIEST

Why

against God

Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle
at the surrounding tables terrified

Theres only one thing left for him to do

PRIEST
Then I go against God
In an eyeblink --
Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer CRACKING it
against the troopers head his attack graceful and precise

a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES
When its over eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing
Everything goes quiet

ANGLE ON A LITTLE BOY

He breaks from his father

knee slowly moving towards

window drawn by a FLICKERING SHADOW
His mouth drops open as --

WHAM -- TWENTY MORE TROOPERS
PUNCH through the windows in unison showering everybody

glass BULLETS whistle through the air everyone SCREAMING
as they scramble for cover The father diving for his son

PRIEST
Folds his hands into the prayer position
VOONI Theres a POP OF AIR and ---

SILENCE
The troopers look around confused -- their guns have
disappeared

ON A NEARBY TABLE
A neat pile of shotguns sit every FIRED BULLET collected
harmlessly in a clean circle around them as if picked out

AARON
After the war was over we figured youd

about you
Uncomfortable with the conversation Priest pulls out a map
unrolling it onto the wooden table He moves his finger
across the paper

PRIEST

AARON

Hundreds of bullets all orderly lined on a table top

Were unable to see what hes doing Aaron picks up a
bullet twirling it in the light

AARON
Maybe if I knew how to use these shed

PRIEST
Sometimes things just happen Faults

AARON
Funny Im the one who used to say that
You were the one who always said

Eyeing Priest Aaron lets the Sheriff in shutting the door
behind him as he leaves The vibe in the room is
uncomfortable -- Priest not even acknowledging Hicks

Five points glowing brightly in the candlelight

HICKS (CONTD)

HICKS
Were the only chance shes got
Priest picks a bullet from the table a carefully notched
CROSS now in its tip (this is what hes been doing) He
SNAPS it in the air

PHHHHTTI
Hicks knife FLIES across the room PINNING the bullet to

wall A thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing
spilling to the floor The kids fast
PRIEST
How you with a gun

HICKS

Nothing more needing to be said Hicks turns to walk out

Hicks nods realizing Priest was ahead of him the whole

time

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Moonlight streams through an open window

Priest places his bible on the nightstand and crouches
beside

thebed closing his eyes Hands clasped

PRIEST
Our Father who art in Heaven hallowed be
thy name Thy Kingdom come Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven
As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and
into the night moving across HALBRIDGE

PRIEST (0S) (CONTD)

Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those that trespass against us and lead
us not into temptation but deliver us
ona

as

nothing

from evil
We see the TOWNSPEOPLE lock their doors bolting the
shutters tucking their children in safely for the night

PRIEST (0S) (CONTD)

For thine is the kingdom and the power and

the glory forever and ever Amen

And now the camera stops on a LARGE SHADOWY FIGURE perched

nearby roofline

The only thing we can see of it is a DUSTER illuminated by
the SOFT GLOW OF A LIT CHEROOTthe Figure watches Priest

he finishes his prayer and blows out a candle
Silently the Figure takes off Flying into the night

But then Lucy was born and as soon as I
saw her I knew I Just knew -iz- Theres

Priest nods his brothers eyes burning into him Hearing

They turn off their bikes and dismout Hicks stepping

The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one

He goes to a shelf its been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE

rwging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes yellowed

He pulls out a GLASS JAR containing SOMETHING MISSHAPEN

stops along the route I think
He draws several Xs along the line His hand coming to a

Like a snake a finger of the claw emerges from the folds of

As if on command the finger retreats back into the jacket

EXT BEGGARS PASS CAMP - LATE NIGHT

Theyve set up camp for the night on the lip of a ridge
Hicks and the Priestess sit by a fire dunking their feet in

nearby stream the wear and tear of their journey evident on
the sheriffs face
Priest lies close by asleep
HICKS
If we push it hard well gain two days on
em Should be enough to get us a jump

PRIESTESS
Weneed more than a jump We need a
miracle

HICKS

Thats the funny thing about time --
He dips his hand in the water and raises it letting the
liquid leak from between his fingers

HICKS (CONTD)
Its always runin right through my
fingers

PRIESTESS
You should try harder sheriff
She cups her hand in the water bringing it to her lips for

drink Hicks smiles leaning forward something on his mind

HICKS
You ever regret it Bein a Priest

PRIESTESS
No

HICKS
What about a husband childrenA
family

PRIESTESS
Ive had a family -- just not the kind
youre familiar with

Hicks glances at Priest

HICKS
What You mean Mr Laffs over there
PRIESTESS
Hes not so bad once you get to know him
A beat Hicks expression becoming serious

HICKS
Hes going to kill her isnt he If
shes turned

PRIESTESS
Yes

HICKS
Theres things that can be done She
doesnt have to die

PRIESTESS
Shes his bloodline and hes a Priest
Its the only way
Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire troubled
but he knows theres no point in discussing it any
further for now

HICKS
And how many of you Priests are left now
A long moment before she speaks

Hicks doesnt know what to Say-

A GROUP OF PRIESTS (OUR TWO amongst them) move silently
through a DEEP TRENCH moist earthen walls rising around
them the air putrid with stink mud clinging to their feet
Last in the line is a particularly FEARSOME PRIEST

the others hes smiling enjoying the action

As a cohesive unit the Priests climb up from the trench
scaling through the muck They find themselves at the base
of the hive looking around at a chilling sight --

THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS
stretching endlessly rising high above in a cone THOUSANDS

OF SLEEPING VAMPIRES

OUR PRIEST motions with his hand to the others giving
precise instructions their movements well coordinated
He stops Hearing a sounda faint but incr

A BEAT as the Priestess looks at the others

PRIESTESS
They know were here
From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP grabbing onto a
Priests leg pulling him down Suddenly DOZENS OF VAMPIRES
emerge seemingly birthed from the soil The warriors fight
valiantly Fiercely But its too much Most are quickly
cut down

PRIEST
Retreat

FEARSOME PRIEST
Battles like a tiger grappling with TWo VAMPIRES their

at his throat fangs inches from his face A couple of quick
moves and - before you realize how - the vanires lay dead
He quickly joins the surviving Priests as they run through

hive a dizzying maze of MUDDY TUNNELS AND TRENCHES

FEARSOME SUDDENLY STOPS
A BLACK TOP HAT lying on the ground catching his eye must

the last remanent of a dandy gentleman He picks it up
admiring the souvenir Puts it on his head

The Priestess races by shooting him a we dont have time
for this look He STOPS her grabbing her shoulder

FEARSOME PRIEST

(WINKS)
What do you think -- Am I a Dapper Dan
She glares running ahead to join the group Fearsome just
smiles taking off the hat

FEARSOME PRIEST (CONTD)

Guess not

From within the hive comes a MIGHTY SHRIEK -- and now
Fearsome starts to run trying to catch the others as they
scramble for daylight The exit just in sight

At the last second --
Hes pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS The
hat still gripped tightly in his hand as hes dragged away
our two Priests reach for him but its too late He
disappears into the darkness as we CUT BACK TO

EXT BEGGARS PASS CAMP - NIGHT

Priest WAKING UP breath catching in his throat

He looks over to find the Priestess working on her cycle
unable to sleep Theres a tension in the air the sense of
something about to break as he joins her

PRIESTESS
Why would the Clergy forbid us from
seeing each other

PRIEST
Maybe they were scared of what we could
do

PRIESTESS

Or what we would do

(PAUSE)
We both know theres something inside the
Order thats off Even if we dont know
what it is

PRIEST
With or without the Clergywere still
Priests And were the only ones who can
stop that train

PRIESTESS
If we survive this we need to expose them
for what they are

PRIEST
(PAUSE)
We won t survive this

She puts down her tools staring fixedly at him

PRIESTESS
You scared to die

PRIEST
No

PRIESTESS
I believed in Heaven my whole life
Believed everything we were taught -- And
nowwhen its finally my timeno more

faith They took it away from me
Priest gazes at her trying his best to be comforting

PRIEST
Whatever happens Wherever it is we go
Well go together
At thatexact moment something inside Priest shifts just a
little bit a door opens -- never to be shut again

PRIEST (CONTD)
What in greater than God but more evil
than the Devil The poor have it the
rich need it -- and if you eat
ityoulldie

PRIESTESS
What

PRIEST
Its a riddle

The Priestess thinks about it

PRIESTESS
Nothing Thats the answer

(BEAT)
Nothing is greater than God Nothing is
more evil than the devil The poor have
nothing the rich need nothing And if
you eat nothing youll die
Its said that warriors can become close friends only when

they
see each others hearts -- Priest now knows this to be true

-PRIEST
What you said beforeabout those nights
when you were dreaming of me --
PRIESTESS
The good nights
PRIEST
Yes The good nights Do you think
maybe tonight
PRIESTESS
Could be one of those nights
She smiles
And then Priest does the most amazing thing he smiles
back
Things happen fast -- He finds himself planting his mouth on
hers the years of conditioning all the ritual and

tradition falling away in a flash
And it is here together in this place where they feel like
they finally truly belong
The last two

A blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze Morning
has come

A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
As our trio forges onward and upward the trail more
treacherous with every twisty ridge the overhangs looming
ominously as they head deeper into the mountain

EXT BEGGARS PASS - LATER

The final climb
Yawning crevices the wind moaning as it whistles between

the

canyon walls

Carefully they ride across DEVILS BRIDGE a finger of
stone

just wide enough for the cycles on either side a straight

drop to oblivion The peak of the mountain Just ahead

The Priestess is in front leading the charge closely

followed by Hicks Priest brings up the rear he stops just

past the bridge looks around

Somethings wrong

HICKS

I- ee itl

Hicks points reaching the top of the mountain

IN THE DISTANCE

A long black line snakes along the rail puffs of heavy
smoke

lining its path The Night Train

Theyre ahead of it Barely

In his excitement Hicks thunders ahead starting the
descent

down the other side The Priestess turns to shout back to

Priest

But hes gone

Off her reaction we CUT TO

EXT CREVASSE - DAY

Tall rock walls flank Priest on either side the
surrounding

mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps Slowly he walks
through the canyon senses fully attuned Its quiet

PRIEST
I know youre there
A slight sound the mist whipping into a pool as if

just moved through it Priest quickly turns but theres
nothing there

A GROUP OF ROCKS
Tumble down the cliff Again Priest abruptly turns
butstill nothing there

This isnt the time to settle old scores

RUNE (0 S )

I disagree This is the perfer time

WOOSH Like lightning the claw LASHES out appearing from
nowhere Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he
was standing He lands on top of the chain backflipping as
it retracts back Gearing up for another attack

RUNE (0s) (CONTD)

Youve lost a step PriestI never came

this close before

PRIEST
Im older now

We can almost bear Rune smile

RUNE Not me

And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction WRAPPING
around Priest like a snake the metal cutting into his body
snapping a ribt

Yelling Priest GRABS the chain PULLING with everything

got Rune flies from the mist dragged by Priest crashing
at his feet The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the
coils grabbing Rune by the jacket picking him up

Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priests
stomach the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh
tearing the muscle Priest SCREAMS a hot rush of blood
staining the desert floor

Rune leaps away landing ontop a boulder

RUNE (CONTD)
You cant outrun the past Priest the
things you did

PRIEST
It was a war Rune

RUNE
It still is
He launches at Priest duster fluttering like wings The two
grapple Runes fangs brushing Priests neck
Its a savage battle Priests muscles and laser-like focus
the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across
the canyon landing against the rock wall likea spider
Hunched ready to strike BUT --

THE PRIESTESS
Appears from within the mist already in mid-leap she lands
beside Priest The two together a formidable presence
But Runes a tough customer he readies himself for another
attack
ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound
Rune looks over sees --
HICKS
Six-shooter pointed right at him

A beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff The
air between them vibrating with energy Crackling Rune
considering his options

(HISSING)
Another time Priest
He skitters up the rock face disappearing into the mist

HAM

Hicks fires a single shot the echo ringing through the
canyon

RUNES BODY
Drops from the fog hitting the ground with a thud Dead
And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest
Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise

HICKS
Tell me you wont kill her
Priest doesnt reply

HICKS (CONTD)
Tell meor Ill shoot you where you

PRIEST
Finally showing your true colors

HICKS
And what is that Some special Priest
code of honor You dont get it Your

PRIEST
Shoot me and it wont matter if you find
Lucy You wont stop that train -- and

The Priestess steps between them looks at Hicks

PRIESTESS
Hes right We need to be together on

Hicks thinks about it knows shes right A tense beat then

HICKS
This aint done
He lowers his gun and walks away

A BEAT as everyone holds their breath wondering whats
to emerge --

VRO000000000MI
SIX BLACK MOTORCYCLES (the same ones who kidnapped Lucy) fly
out from within the car Vampires covered in rider leather
protected from the sun heads obscured by BLAST HELMETS
Priest turns to the other two

PRIEST
Make sure you get on that train

(BEAT)
Ill catch up
Before they can respond he banks his cycle to the left

THE VAMPIRE RIDERS

Take the bait going for Priest They gun their cycles
enginesWHINING as they rev forward their LEADER unleashing
a chain swirling it above his head

With a SNAP he lashes it at Priest the chain catching in

wheel the sound of metal grinding as

PRIEST
is thrown His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in
wild arcs He hits the earth with a painful skid using the
momentum to roll back onto his feet
He checks his stomach the wounds of enina tg xnorA

his shirt bright red No time for first aid as he turns just
in time to see

TWO RIDERS
Throwing a STEEL CHAIN to the other pulling the line taut
ready to take him out Approaching fast

PRIEST

At the last second DUCKS grabbing onto the chain

himself around in a graceful arc and KICKING his legs into a

colossus

split WHAM his feet SLAM the two cyclists off their bikes
and into the dirt

He lands back on the ground in a crouch the steel chain
tight in his grip -- Ready for battle

And he gets it

THE OTHER FOUR RIDERS
Circle Priest surrounding him the ROAR of their engines
like massive power drills

PRIEST
Snaps the chain above his head bullwhip style LASHING out
The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider 1s

tangled mess
With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest These
vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe Stronger
quicker Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs

A BRUTAL FIGHT

Spinning twisting kicking gnashing Bodies locked in deep
combat as Priest fends off the ferocious attackers War

Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers With a
SCREECH their faces burn bodies instantly SLACKENING in

Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs knocking the creature
off his bike In a flash he FLINGSa helmet into the

LEAPS onto the back of the train

Before he does
Hicks nods knowing thisll probably be the last time he

And with that she throttles forward disappearing
Alone Hicks takes a deep breath looks at --

Who knows what horrors lie behind it He pops a WAD OF
ATOMIC CRAW in his mouth and pulls his six shooters

HICKS
Mytuxn now Priest
BAMI He kicks the door in

INT VAMPIRE TRAIN CAR - SAME

Sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber but only reaching
4 so far as if the sun itself were scared to enter

Hicks rolls in guns at the ready It takes a moment for his
eyes to adjust but when they do he finds a series of OLD
WOODEN COFFINS stacked atop one another like cargo

He quickly moves through the car careful not to disturb
anything We FOLLOW with him as he exits entering --

INT BLACK STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS
Designed so one can move between the cars without exposure

the sun making the train a world of eternal midnight
Carefully Hicks opens the next compartments door

Its pitch black
inside

The only thing we can make out is a LARGE CAGE whats

impossible to see in the darkness just a GIANT HULKING C
SHADOW Its steady hefty breathing letting us know whatever
it is its asleep

Hicks covers his nose from the bestial smell the cage

up so much room he is forced to press himself against the
bars his body just inches from the thing inside

THE TWITCH OF BLACK LEATHER WINGS
Makes Hicks stop in his tracks silently praying to

listening

A long momentand then the steady breathing begins again
Whew Hicks continues through the cabin finally making it
to the door as --

EXT VAMPIRE TRAIN - DAY

The Priestess engine at full boil makes her way up the
train eyes on the engine up ahead

ACROSS THE BODY OF THE TRAIN

A long line of tiny SLATS open up RIFLE BARRELS quickly
emerging snapping into place with a click BLAM BLAMI
BLAM The guns FIRE AWAY bullets blasting all around the
Priestess missing her by millimeters

She flicks down a TOGGLE SWITCH theres a mighty roar a
massive surge of power and WHOOSH she ROCKETS forward The
bullets chewing up the dirt behind her

Seemingly from out of nowhere motors up to the train car
riding the vampire cycle He grabs onto a gun barrel and
SWINGS into an arc lifting himself off the bike and -

Lands on the roof of the train Hard

EXT BELOW THE TRAIN - SAME TIME

The cycle quickly ripped apart as it falls under the
juggernaut getting crushed sparks flying off the rails

EXT TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME

Priest collapses against the metal the strain beginning to
wear he blinks up at the sky close to passing out
Suddenly a FIGURE steps in front of him blotting out the
sun Priest squints unable to trust his eyes he must be

HALLUCINATING --
ITS BLACK HAT He looks down at Priest bowing with a
slight flourish

BLACK HAT
And the third day He shall rise again
Priest cant believe it seeing his long dead comrade his
face etched with shock all he can do is ask --

PRIEST
- How
Black Hat smiles baring hi fangs

BLACK HAT
Oh ye of little faith
The understanding hits Priest immediately crashing over him
like a wave

PRIEST
-They turned you

BLACK HAT
No PriestI turned them
He smiles wider as we CROSSCUT TO

INT VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME

Hicks still hunting for Lucy making his way to the next
car
He slides open the door stepping carefully inside
candlelight softly illuminating the space

Hes greeted by a sight that makes his blood freeze

DOZENS OF OPEN COFFINS FILL THE CAR
Long black boxes lined in orderly rows flickering light
bouncing warmly off their mahogany casings -- The sound of

DEEP TORTURED BREATHING lets us know the OCCUPANTS are
asleep

HICKS

(under his breath)
Shit

Gritting his teeth he walks between the rows quiet as
possible The interiors of the coffins are dark hard to see
whats lying inside just that horrible breathing sound

As Hicks moves past his body brushes the wood the space so
very tight

WHAM The train CATCHES the rail and the car shakes
KNOCKING HIM INTO A COFFIN Jarring it

He stops Holding his breathbut

Nothing happens

A quick Hail Mary (the man becoming more of a convert with
every step) and he continues on

He doesnt notice as behind hi a PX rises from one of

the coffins

CROSSCUT TO
EXT TRAIN ROOF -SAME TIME

Priest and Black Hat eye each other landscape whipping past
at a furious rate the train blasting along the tracks

BLACK HAT

Lost souls abandoned by divinity No
belief no voice to guide them through
the wilderness Sound familiar

Priest doesnt reply warily eyeing him

Lack of faith Thats what I found in my
new brethren And so it was I

discovered my true calling -- To teach
To lead

Something in the distance catches Priests eye a BLACK SPEC
on the horizon -- Its The Cities His jaw tightens he

knows there isnt much time

PRIEST
So this is how you go about it One by
one killing every last remaining Priest

BLACK HAT
It was the only way The Cities are
defenseless nowno one left to stop us
from entering our Eden But I was kind --
I gave every last one the choice I never
had

Now its your turn
Almost imperceptibly the two make a shift in their postures
the tension between the two warming up Two warriors
steeling for a fight

its better to be with your enemies than
to be alone Priest Humanity had its
chance

Its time to make way for new blood
Priest lowers his head when he raises it his reply comes
easy and without hesitation

PRIEST
Yours

WE HEAR A HUM
Molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits the roar
of the train gently subsiding as if the universe itself

to leave these two room to battle
And before anyone knows it theyre already mid-fight The
SLAM and COLLISION of bodies giving way to the graceful

and echo of Priest combat

Then as combustibly fast as it started -- the tableau drops
They stand wind whipping around them in lethal currents
Black Hat having to shout to be heard

BLACK HAT
They taught us God created man in His
image but they lied Man created God
in a image -- And so like man God is
weak Corrupt Merciless
He wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek

BLACK HAT (CONTD)

Who do you fight for Priest The
Orders collapsed The Church nothing
but a line of decrepit ruined old men

Charlatans

Your faith has failed you Priest

(BEAT)
Join me Join me and have the best of
both worlds --Walk in the sun Stalk in

can BE one

With ferocious instinct he launches forward feet digging
into the metal
The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact Rolling across the
roof bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the
next car
The warriors rise locked in a furious coilas WHOOSHI train
car after train car passes beneath them Each leaping at
j ust the right moment to land onto the next
But Priest is outmatched
As they hit the final car Priest flies across the roof
catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over

body dangling over the side Exhausted and bloodied

Black Hat calmly approaches his foot dangerously close to
Priests hand The landscape below-whipping past at an
incredible speed

BLACK HAT
Your problem is you keep looking to God
for-your power -- But I know the real
truth

(BEAT)
Youve been praying to an empty sky
And now he SWIPES his foot across the roof knocking off
Priests hand as one would swat a bug Priest falls below
getting caught under the train and quickly dragged under

BLASTS OF STEAM vent whi te hot from between the wheels

She reaches into her pack and lugs out a CROWBAR pulling up

to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons

hoping to jam up the works

The machine chews it up like candy

CROSSCUT TO

Hicks is almost at the door hand reaching for the handle
He hears a RUSTLING sound and turns to look behind him
But theres nothing just the open coffins

Turning back Hicks catches his breath

A VAMPIRE hangs upside down from the ceiling blocking the
door Its red eyes snap in anticipation a shiny BLACK
PROBOSCIS darting from its mouth

Hicks SPITS a wad of ATOMIC CRAW at the creature It
RIEKSI dropping to the floor writhing The sick smell of
cooked flesh filling the car

HICKS LOOKS BEHIND HIM
DOZENS OF VAMPIRES ARE NOW AWAKE Sitting up in their
coffins the foul creatures all blood-eyeing Hicks like the
coffins

dinner he most surely is

HICKS
Shit
With a WAIL the vampires quickly scramble from their

sharp talons scratching at the wood snapping the planks
Desperate he wrenches open the door darting into --

INT STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS

and manages to SLAM the door behind him just in time as the
hungry beings CRASH against itl

A

He wedges a knife in the door-handle bashing it with his
revolver jamming the door trapped shut

He turns to head to the next car but theres a THICK CHAIN
AND PADLOCK wrapped around the door aWILD-EYED FAMILIAR
peering out from inside the door window Hicks SHOOTS the
padlock but no luck it doesnt break

Hes trapped

THE DOOR BEHIND HICKS BUCKLES ON ITS HINGES
Itll hold but not for long

EXT UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - SAME TIME

Priest is still alive Barely

He hangs in tatters desperately clinging to the
undercarriage face and body punched with bruises and blood

Jaw set he begins to move through the undercarriage hand
over hand every movement sheer agony

Hicks stares at the door as it starts to BREAK from its
hinges He trains his gun on it a feeble gesture --- but

all hes got left
Then theres a horrible SCREECH
having

HICKS TURNS
The WILD-EYED FAMILIAR charges attacking from behind

unlocked the chain and opened the door He SCREAMS sinking
a KNIFE in Hicks side

Hicks spins slamming his attacker in the nose with a palm
heel strike knocking the Familiar out instantly

Hicks pulls the knife out blood flowering across his shirt
as the vampires continue to PUMMEL the door behind him

He trips over the chain and staggers into --

INT ASSEMBLY CAR - CONTINUOUS
Collapsing to the floor he presses his body against the
to close it

HIS EYES SEARCH THE CAR

Its bare Absolutely nothing in here A single candle
burns on the floor dimly illuminating the room

Weakly he crosses the space and goes to the next door This
ones got a THICK PADLOCK too

HICKS
Dam
He site on the floor breathing hard knowing this is as far
as he goes
Gradually another sound becomes audible Hicks listens
nervous He holds his breath straining to hear
Its someone elses BREATHING

IN THE CORNER

A HUNCHED FIGURE sitsits back to him Hiddenin shadow
Hicks levels his gun slowly moving towards the shape the
candlelight giving him a glimpse of its face

He can hardly believe it

She looks up ahead

Smudged like a greasestain looms large across the horizon
right in the trains path

She squints up to the sky analyzing the sun making a quick

Then she looks at the train Smiles

She flicks the Nitros Toggle one last time Her bike ROCKETS
past the train engine speeding into a curtain of dust
Disappearing

Hicks crouches beside Lucy his gun trained on her
She site listlessly her skin pale eyes lost on the wall in
front of her

No response She seems almost catatonic He reaches into
his pocket pulling out her photograph showing it to her

HICKS (CONTD)
Im here with your uncle
That gets her attention she looks at Hicks -- And she looks
scared
WHAP1

The car door outside finally starts to give freely metal
breaking open The sound of SQUEALING vampires

Hicks runs tothe car door in one quick motion SCOOPING up
the chain and WRAPPING it around the handle TYING IT TIGHT
just as --

A TALON

Reaches through the opening long bony fingers swiping at
Hicks like switchblades as he falls backwards pain shooting
up his body

ANOTHER ARM breaks through the small window clawing at the
air the door BANGING REPEATEDLY against the chain

Hicks places himself between Lucy and the door not noticing
as she eyes the blood soaking through his shirt

HICKS (CONTD)
Stay behind me Ill hold ‘em off as
long as I can
BLAMI BLAM Hicks FIRES bullets peppering the creatures as
they HOWL -- but they keep at it the thick chain stretched
tight ready to snap

ONE VAMPIRE
Manages to scramble through it charges at Hicks fangs
glistening BAMI With a twitch it collapses in a heap a
well placed bullet between the eyes

EXT-THE CITIES - SAME TIME
A MASSIVE GATE not opened for decades slowly GRINDS open

complex series of CHAINS and WINCHES scraping to life The
Cities now open to the approaching vampire train

EXT TRAIN SAME TIME
The SCREAM of the whistle like victory as the locomotive

approaches the city limits sending up a giant plume of
billowing steam

The sky above already starting to cloud black as --
again

hands

INT ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME TIME

Hicks continues to FIRE the vampires seconds from entering
the car
He turns to look back at Lucy But shes gone

HICKS

Lucy

WHAM A WOODEN PLANK slams him over the head knocking the
gun from his hand Woozy he spins around to find Lucy
standing over him holding the plank above her head

He scoots back just as WHAM the plank comes back down

splintering apart across the floor

HICKS (CONTD)
Lucy wait
She doesnt jabbing at him with the broken plank he dodges
it barely but she keeps coming

HICKS (CONTD)

Lucy dont do this
The girls just too fast She keeps pushing him backwards
until hes dangerously close to the vampires clawing

Hicks closes his eyes knowing this is it

A FIST

PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor (the one
through which Lucy escaped before) wood splintering into
tiny shards

Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy
nocking her unconscious

He dives for his gun scooping it up and leveling it at the
hole ready to fire at whatevers coming through

ITS PRIEST
He sticks his head through the opening having been drawn by
the sound of gunfire Hicks cant believe it

PRIEST
(reaching for Lucy)
Give her to me Hurry
caught

Hicks thinks about it unsure

PRIEST (CONTD)
-- They1llget through the door any
second Give her to mei
Screeching ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening
Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot
He picks Lucy up handing her to Priest
Priest disappears with her Hicks climbing down behind just
as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with
screeching vampires
Hicks BLASTS away but theres too many of them they kee
coming He drops into the hole --

e)

EXT UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

Landing in the undercarriage Coming face to face with the
speeding track everything shaking like an earthquake

A VAMPIRE
Jabs its head through the hole teeth chattering-- but the
creature cant go any further the sunlight already making
its skin smoke
On his back Hicks worms his way down following Priestas
they climb up a LADDER attached to the side of the train

EXT TRAIN CONTINUOUS

They work their way up the side making it to the roof
exhausted Priest carrying the still unconscious Lucy

HICKS
We should jump

PRIEST
Not until we stop the trains
But now Hicks isnt even looking at him his attention
up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them

HICKS

(SWALLOWS)
Too late

THE CITYSCAPE
of

them

Lucy

his

the

t Towers above as the train approaches so close the smell

sulphur and carbon clogs their noses

But thats when something catches Hicks eyeup ahead on
the tracks --

Someone stands awaiting the train

ITS THE PRIESTESS -- Standing defiant as the train barrels
towards her An ant in front of a battleship

She sees Hicks and Priest-on top of the train Lucy with

Taking one last look at Priest -- she smiles
And spreads her arms open

ON PRIEST
Horrified realizing what shes going to doand powerless
to stop her

PRIEST
What happens next happens fast
Priest GRABS Hicks folding his body around both he and

hands coming together in prayer feet leaving the train as -

E ERYTH ggas BLACK

The sound of a heartbeatA threshold A zone of transition
A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the
Priestess The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND
HER as if smashing into a building

She doesnt move

A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each
other the cars JUMPING the rails

MMMM gQES BLACK

A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air

body shielding Hicks and Lucy train care skipping across

earth careening through the air
through

And WHAM we FUSE back into real time as train cars CRASH
down sheets of dust clouding the sky in a roiling storm of
debris and shrapnel until finallyit all comes to a stop
Its quiet

We move through the swirling sand until we find --

PRIEST
He stands bruised and bloody staring at the sky Watching
A dazed Hicks beside him Lucy in his arms as she comes to
A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air
Led by the Purebloods HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from
within the broken cars taking to the sky in a massive black
swarm tangling together in flowing shapes Beautiful
Terrifying
Then in one horrible instant --
They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand flying towards the
Cities Sensing the blood that awaits

HICKS

(HORRIFIED)
Theyre gonna make it
The creatures arctowards the metropolisthe city within

THEIR REACH
Priest studies the sky and all at oncehe knows

PRIEST
No theyre not

THE SUN
PUNCHES through the teeming mass
A few rays at first but then more and more -cracking

the black tide like shattered glass

Hicks eyes widen witnessing an amazing eight as the
vampires bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm
withering quickly becoming nothing more than husks
Floating black kites

Hicks and Priest stand surrounded by the epic destruction
fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze
the

HICKS
You knew they wouldnt make it
A long time before Priest answers

PRIEST
She knew
He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN
as if smashed by the very hand of God

THE PRIESTESS

Lies before it Somehow not a scratch on herBut
somethings wrong -- something inside her broken something
elemental She doesnt have much time

Priest kneels beside her taking her hand Trying to be
strong for her

PRIEST (CONTD)
Do you want me to

PRIESTESS

(e)
Priest lowers his head The following having been spoken by
him all too often

PRIEST
You shall wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow Glory be to the Father
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit
The words are heavy each harder than the next

PRIEST (CONTD)
-- As it was in the beginning is now and
ever shall be World without end

(BEAT)
Amen

IN THE DISTANCE
A FIGURE escapes through the dust lurching towards the
Cities-- Its Black Hat

PRIEST
sees him but chooses to stay with the Priestess brushing

hair from her face
Priest

of

PRIESTESS
I wish we couldve had more time

PRIEST
-Me too
She reaches up placing her hand on his chest

PRIESTESS
Wherever it is we go -- we go together
right
She smiles weakly but Priest can see shes scared

He gives her one last kiss cradling her body sand circling
them as she draws her final breath

CUT TO
EXT THE WASTELAND - DUSK

The sun setting on the horizon
A nearby PYRE consumes the last of the Priestess body as

saddles up on a vampire bike the flames rising behind him
Hicks approaches Lucy huddled in a blanket shivering

The two men exchange a look the snap and flash of the fire
reflecting in their eyes

HICKS
When youre finished -- You know where to
find me
A tense beat then
Priest GUNS the engine Hicks and Lucy watching as he blazes
towards the Cities the sky above the color of hellfire

CUT TO
EXT THE CITIES NIGHT

The sound of a CHOIR
The soaring ethereal tones carrying us through the forest

BRICK SMOKESTACKS-- finally coming to rest on A GIANT CROSS
atop a mosaic BASILLICA the colored tiles black with ash
Were back in CLERGY CITY

INT CLERGY CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Evening mass The place is packed every pew filled with
WORSHIPERS

CROSSCUT TO

INT CLERGY CHAMBER - SAME

Shadows and light
A cabal of MONSIGNORS stand shrouded in white robes

awaiting
to be anointed by ORELAS A private ceremony
CROSSCUT TO
INT CATHEDRAL - SAME
A LINE OF CHILDREN kneel before the altar the MONSIGNOR
raising the Host offering communion
He suddenly stops his expression dropping as
PRIEST
Slowly makes his way down the aisle bruised and bloodied
his very presence a direct affront to this place A woman
GASPS somebody faints
CROSSCUT TO
INT CHAMBER - SAME
Orelas dips his hand in water touching a Monsignors
forehead
ORELAS
Ecces Agnes Dei ecces qui tollit peccata

THERES A LOUD CRASH
Everyone turns to see the massive chamber doors BURSTING
inwards THE BODIES OF TWO GUARDS skidding across the marble
igniting

floor

PRIEST ENTERS THE CHAMBER
A true force of nature now coming like the Fourth Horseman
Grief and betrayal stoking his anger higher a blaze

behind his eyes

BLACK HAT

Steps from the shadows Deep wounds line his face the cross
tattoo now gouged and distorted with blood -- He smiles
BLACK HAT

Im afraid youre too late Priest

THE MONSIGNORS
Shed their robes revealing fresh BITE MARKS on their necks
Orelas new-found fangs glint in the candlelight

ORELAS
And why shouldnt we live forever

(HISSES)
Were Gods very voice His vessel

PRIEST
Stands shell shocked the level of betrayal staggering

BLACK HAT ATTACKS

SLAMMINGinto him the two warriors going at it in a brutal
battle the vampire raking his claws across Priests face
drawing blood

PRIEST
Sends him sailing through the air Black Hat crashing into a
collection of CANDLE HOLDERS an ancient TAPESTRY catching
fire flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The
chamber erupting in an orange blaze

THE MONSIGNORS SHRIEK
Bodies contorting in grotesque shapes as they BECOME
Black Hat stands triumphant flames rising behind him
SQUEEZING

BLACK HAT
With them I can start anew You cant
stop it --

(SMILES)
Must be Gods will
He flies across the room BARRELING into Priest with
everything hes got DIGGING a hand into Priests wound

BLACK HAT (CONTD)
IT looked and beheld a pale horse and His
name that sat on him was Death --

Priest coughs up blood Black Hat smiles wrapping a hand
around Priests throat LIFTING him off the floor

the life from him

And all hell followed with him

He raises his head back ready to sink his teeth Priest too
exhausted to fight back This is it

THE GIANT GOLD CROSS

Breaks from the wall with a GROAN PLUMMETING towards them
Black Hat stops his eyes snapping upward

At the last second --

PRIEST
WRENCHES himself fromBlack Hats grip tumbling across the
floor
WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat pulverizing hi

Ae¢
Chunks of glass and stone rain down around Priest the
chamber starting to COLLAPSE Diving he barely makes it
out the rotunda CRASHING down behind him
The Monsignors lunge but Priest manages to jam the doors
shut locking them in They BASH against the door SHRIEKING
horribly the chamber now an oven

Priest presses against the door it SPLINTERS all around

the terrible sound RISING until finally
it stops

PRIEST

(WHISPERS)
Forgive me
He collapses making the sign of the cross

CUT TO
EXT CLERGY CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER

Complete chaos

PEOPLE stream out of the massive doorway stampeding down

stairs the giant structure enveloped in smoke and flame
Priest looks up to find FATHER KOEPPEN The old man staring
-at him A lost soul

KOEPPEN
Am I next
Priest approaches -- Koeppen closing his eyes ready for the
blow he knows is to come
But Priest only lifts the mans head studying his neck
Hes clean
And without a single word -- Priest just walks away
When Koeppen opens his eyes hes a new man -- a man

With renewed energy he looks to the crowd around him And
for the first moment in a long time He believes

KOEPPEN (CONTD)

(CALLING OUT)
People dont run God is here for youl
He wants you to STOPI Stop and ask
yourself a question
And the people DO stop looking to him the panic leaving
their eyes

KOEPPEN (CONTD)
Ask yourselves -- Where am I going

At this Priest turns the question catching him as well
And its only now he realizes --

He has no answer

CUT TO
EXT OUTPOST 10 - DAWN

The windmill

Its rusty blades scrape along the metal catching the first
rays of the day

AARON PACE is already up working on rebuilding his house
He stops gazing off in the distance

ON THE HORIZON
A cycle Two black specs riding it Hicks and Lucy
Dropping his tools he runs to meet it

CUT TO
INT OUTPOST 10 - SEVERAL DAYS LATER - NIGHT

Time has passed The moon shines through an open doorway

Lucy lies in bed Aaron spoon feeding her a warm broth He
smiles Lucy reluctant to smile back still uncomfortable

with her teeth

But eventually -- for her fathershe manages it

HICKS
Leans against the backwall watching Lucy glances his
way then shyly looks away

AARON
I cant thank you enough for what youve
done sheriff

TI
HICKS

Just make sure she keeps on the tea
Its a special brew -- lessens the
bloodthirstsomething my granddad
taught me
Aaron nods hopefully squeezing his daughters hand

CUT TO
EXT OUTPOST 10 - LATER
A full moon
Hicks stands on the porch enjoying the breeze as he pops a
wad of chaw in his mouth
A MOVEMENT out in the darkness catches his attention

IN THE DISTANCE

A FIGURE
Stands astride a motorcycle shadowed in the moonlight

Hicks approaches the wind kicking up whistling through the
emptiness Even though he cant see him -- Hicks knows who
it is

HICKS

t doesnt have to be like this

Priest just stands staring

Hicks hand curls around the revolver

Priest looks to the cabin the challenge hanging in the air

THEN

He steps from the bike advancing towards Hicks
Hicks pulls his gun leveling it

Priest keeps coming the wind blowing harder as he
approaches A feeling of inevitability

Hicks stands his ground cocking his gun

HICKS (CONTD)
D I t- -make dQ this

PRIEST
Stares into his eyes and --
Something passes between them something so strong and
personal it transcends emotion

Hicks FIRES

But Priest is pone

Hicks looks around --

Theres no sign of him not even the bike

HICKS (CONTD)
(REALIZING)

SHIT
He RACES back to the cabin

INT OUTPOST 10 - SAME
Hicks BURSTS through the doorway finding

LUCY AND AARON

Sitting peacefully on the bed together just as he left
them

Aaron holds up the cup turning it over

AARON
All done

(BEAT)
We heard you fire your gun is
everything OK
A beat -- then Hicks nods

HICKS
Nothing to worry about just a coyote
Aaron smiles happy enough to be with Lucy

AARON
Well were all Gods creatures
Hicks turns ready to leave but something on the table
catches his eye

THE DESERT RAT S HOMEMADE CROSS
He picks it up turning it in his hand the colored stones
0 catching the moonlightHow the hell did it get there
wings

AARON (CONTD)
Dont forget your cross -- Its
beautiful
A flicker of a smile crosses Hicks face realizing

HICKS
ACTUALLY --

(BEAT)
I think its for youand Lucy

CUT TO
EXT WASTELAND - NIGHT

Alone in the darkness Priest sits on his cycle his hand
clutching the WELL-WORN PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY

His eyes shift gazing into the distance at the outpost a
warm glow emanating from within the cabin

He places the photo in his pocket The wind making a high
lonely sound

VRROOOOOMI

Priest streaks into the night bathed in moonlight
desolation opening around him

He disappears into the emptiness

CUT TO
EXT WASTELAND - NIGHT

The vampire train
A car lies half-buried in the sand mangled cage within

A BLACK CLAW

Emerges from inside clamping onto metal something dragging
itself out into the moonlight

Its a PUREBLOOD

With a SCREECH it takes to the night sky massive black

fluttering arcing towards the twinkling metropolis

FADE OUT
