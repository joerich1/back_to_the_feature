TOMORROW NEVER DIES
(BOND 18)
Screenplay by Bruce Feirstein

(for educational purposes only)

FADE IN ON
EXT DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN
Super THE KHYBER PASS AFGHANISTAN

Were looking down at what used to be called The End of the
Known
World A landscape that is both beautiful and forbidding

In the center of this vista there is a deep ravine

Pushing in on the ravine there appears to be a giant icicle
hanging
over a cliff

AN ICE FALL A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid

Pushing in still closer there is a tiny black dot inching its
way up
the ice A human figure This is

JAMES BOND BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT 007

Bond is sweating and straining four hundred feet in the air He
has

an ice-pick tethered to each hand ice-cleats on his boots A
black

backpack As he climbs spider-like pulling himself up he goes
to

JAM A CLEAT into the ice but -

CRACK A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off CRASHING onto the
rocks

below Regaining his foothold Bond looks down Certain death
He

looks up So very very far to go Bond shakes his head

BOND
There has to be an easier way to earn
a living
SHOCK

Still Bond climbs Huffing sweating he goes up and up until

ANOTHER ANGLE -

Hes 25 feet from the top He drives a first ice pick in Gets a
toehold But when he slams the second pick in -

THE ICE WALL SHATTERS FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM IN THE

BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -

And 007 is now dangling 575 feet in the air staring at a

torrent of

water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist

attached

to the first ice-pick still embedded in the wall

Bond pauses Thinks And coolly begins to swing himself back and
forth in widening arcs like a clocks pendulum

At the high point of his swing Bond reaches back to smash his

other

pick into the ice - BUT MISSES He looks up at

THE FIRST ICE PICK STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

Beginning to work its way out The tether fraying

RETURN ON BOND -

Cautiously 007 begins to swing a second time Once Twice And
on

the third arc he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES
AGAIN

ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

Now jutting downward barely holding The tether is almost
totally

frayed through

RETURN ON BOND -

One last chance Bond swings Once Twice He reaches back
hurls

himself at the wall lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO
THE

ICE Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one Still
hes all but home He reaches over grabs the first pick (barely
holding in the ice) jabs it in and continues upward
EXT THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -
Exhausted Bond reaches up over the edge He drives a pick down

through the ice into the hard flat ground beneath the
waterbed

As he pulls himself up (his full weight on the first ice-pick )
h
° smashes a second pick through the ice into the waterbed and -
THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -
Breaking off with a groan tumbling onto the rocks below

IN THE WATERBED -

A torrent of water crashes over 007 Fighting the oncoming

deluge
he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland

NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL INLAND)

Bond stands walks out of the riverbed He looks back at the
cliff

BONDS POV - THE WATER FALL -

On either side of the water there are two small RADAR DISHES
angled

down scanning every inch of the area save for the waterfall
itself

In other words This was the only way in

RETURN ON BOND -
007 shrugs From his backpack he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED

BLACK

CANISTERS and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX He presses a button on
the

side of the box and - fwap fwap fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold

He presses buttons on the canisters TELESCOPIC SKI POLES Bond
slaps on the skis and takes off through the snow

EXT SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -
EXT MOUNTAIN CLIFF -

Bond hurtles over the side going airborne landing 100 feet
below
amidst boulders In perfect Olympic form he skis out and down
EXT MOUNTAINSIDE -

Bond slaloms down in and out of trees to avoid detection At

the

bottom where the snow thins he comes to

A ROCK OUTCROPPING

Hiding behind the rock Bond takes off his skis knapsack He

unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE Puts ona

HEADSET He creeps up on the rock and looks out on

A SECRET MILITARY BASEAIR STRIP (BONDS POV)

50 feet down 200 yards away 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a
dozen

MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on
the

ground (one partially obscured by a truck) plus FLATBEDS
carrying

HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES

Near a QUONSET HUT a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area
with

INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side

BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

Props his rife on the boulder and peers through the GUN SIGHT

THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -

He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men
bargaining

over weapons and forklifts loadingunloading crates of
munitions

EXT MI-6 LONDON - DAY
The DB-5 drives past the guard
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Debriefing Bond M and several others listen as NATO COLONEL

DOMINIQUE EVERHART (early 30s Belgian) refers to video clips
from

the Khyber Pass sequence

COL DOMINIQUE EVERHART
To sum up After analyzing the tire
inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6
video tape NATO believes the red
box contains approximately eighty
kilograms of U235 weapons grade
uranium - an incredibly hard
incredibly heavy incredibly lethal
substance

M
And thats enough enriched uranium to
produce how many nuclear devices

COL DQMINIQUE EVERHART
Depending on the builders sophistication
- one crude bomb that could devastate
London Paris New York Berlin - or all
four if they have the latest technology

Theres a pregnant pause in the room

M
And the participants

COL DOMINIQUE EVERHART
(pointing at the screen)

Kim Dae Yung Moscow-trained North
Korean nuclear weapons specialist
apparently fell out of favor with the
current North Korean regime after a
botched attempt to steal fissionable
material from a British light-water
reactor in South Africa - an accident
that left him entirely hairless

Another face appears on the screen

COL DOMINIQUE EVERHART (contd)

And Rendera Sikrahm also known as
Richard Stamper Freelance mercenary
Laos and Cambodia His father was
from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con-
scripted by the British government to
fight in China during World War II -
after which the family settled in
Hong Kong where the young Stamper
was undoubtedly treated like a second
class citizen by both the Hong Kong
Chinese and local British

(beat aside)
Weve all read about the signs at the
British swimming pools in Hong Kong
that said No Ghurkas allowed

BOND
Nothing like a little imperialism to
promote loyalty among the faithful

COL DOMINIQUE EVERHART
(stifles a smile then)

In conclusion Both these men have a
vendetta against the world They are
nuclear armed and dangerous And
having failed to get the UZ35 through
the old opium route - the Khyber Pass
- its NATOs belief that their next
attempt will be through Bulgaria -
where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force
will be there to stop them

M

Thank you Colonel Everhart

(stands turns to)

007 Id like to see you in my office
Why dont you and the Colonel exchange
numbers if you need more information

BOND
Yes M

M exits Bond approaches Dominique She smiles warmly Theres
a

mutual attraction - but theres something else going on
unspoken

BOND
Interesting presentation

DOMINIQUE
Interesting video tape

BOND
They point I shoot

DOMINIQUE
(feels her pockets)
Do you have a pen I just got promoted
and dont have my new cards yet

BOND
Of course

Bond hands her a PEN She regards it cautiously

DOMINIQUE

With a Sphinx-like smile she watches Bond leave
INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Where Bond encounters MONEYPENNY also walking to Ms office

BOND
Moneypenny Weve got to stop meeting
like this They may be on to us

MONEYPENNY
Hello James Enjoy your meeting

BOND
In the darkest moments its what I
live for Especially since Ive
heard how much you like to watch
On the hidden camera

Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and in the background sees
Dominique
leave the conference room and walk down the hall away from

them
MONEYPENNY
By the way James Ordinarily I would
never ask but Werent you and

that Colonel once stranded on a raft
for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea

BOND
Moneypenny How indiscreet Have
you ever known me to kiss and tell

Theyve come to a security door She punches in a code -

MONEYPENNY
Actually Ive never known you to do
either But -

BOND

- We all want what we cant have

MONEYPENNY
Not all of us 007

The door opens They go into
INT MS ANTEROOM (MONEYPENNYS AREA) - CONTINUOUS

BOND
What - no lust for adventure

MONEYPENNY
No 007 Its just that Ive learned
from personal experience - that when
we get what we want -
(beat)
Somehow the reality is never as
Satisfying as the fantasy

Bond scowls Moneypenny smiles wryly points to the inner door

MONEYPENNY
Dont keep M waiting

INT MS OFFICE - DAY

M is behind her desk MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a
high-

handed Teflon-coated politician with the survival instincts of

plutonium Theyve been arguing

M
Come in 007 You know the Minister

BOND
Of course
(nods to)
Minister Johnstone

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

He

Bond sits in an armchair M presses a button and a videobio of
ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her Mid-50s regal

M
Tell me 007 what do you know about
Elliot Harmsway

BOND

(quipping)
Only what I read in the newspapers

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
(disdainfully)
His newspapers

BOND

(glancing sideways)
Occasionally yes

(directly to M)
British media mogul Born in Hong Kong
controls newspapers TV radio cable
satellites books magazines movies
computer software Theme parks

M
(holding up a copy of)
- Along with Tomorrow - the first
world-wide newspaper Circulation 27
million Daily -

BOND
Able to topple governments with a single
story - as he says in his press
JOHNSTONE
(hurrumph)

Exactly
Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically Then a very tight-lipped M
senses hes about to enter a minefield

BOND
Whats Harmsway done

M
It seems 007 weve received a tip

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
A rumor - from an anonymous source -

M
- that Sir Elliot may be involved
with Stamper and Yung and the
missing Uranium

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
Hearsay Idle chatter from a source
you cant identify - who insists on
talking only to 007 Nothing but
loose talk and innuendo

M
That may be the case at present
Minister Johnstone But our own

sources suspect that Mr Harmsway
used his considerable Russian media

- holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky
President of the Ukraine - in trade
for the uranium

(M has punched a button and Valentins video bio has appeared)

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
More scurrilous unsubstantiated gossip

BOND
Perhaps But it does explain how an
ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms
dealer is suddenly portrayed as a
long-time friend of the people
(beat)
If you believe what you read in the papers

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
(annoyed)

Need I remind the two of you that
Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway
- is directly descended from the Earl
of Aberdeen That his Scottish
ancestors practically invented Hong
Kong - and out of sheer gratitude
Queen Victoria herself named the port
Aberdeen Harbor in their honor

M
(long pause then)

No more than I need remind you
Minister that merely being a member
of the lucky sperm club - does not
preclude one from a life of criminal
activity

Johnstone is reeling M continues to Bond with aplomb
M
The reason I invited the Minister
here 007 was to reassure him that
this investigation will be handled
with the utmost discretion

BOND
Of course

M
Which is also why Ive withheld this
information from NATO and our allies

BOND
(nods then recalling)
Didnt we once investigate Harmsway

M
Yes 1988 He was furious at the
British plan to return Hong Kong and
supposedly started his own negotiations
with the Chinese Government The inquiry
went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a
rather powerful enemy -

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
Not to mention the chaos it caused at
Whitehall when his newspapers began
screaming for the recall of the
sitting government

M
(a beat then)
Im sending you to Venice 007
Youre to check out the source
determine whether Elliot Harmsway is
involved with the enriched uranium
and if so stop him

BOND
How will I meet the informant

She hands Bond a CARNIVAL MASK

M
Youre to wear this mask at the Venice
Carnival and wait to be contacted

BOND
I understand
And he exits M frowning

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
(standing to leave)
There is one last thing 007 Elliot
Harmsway is vital to the economic
interests of this nation Hes also
a major contributor to the party I

expect him to be given every consideration

BOND
Political considerations

MINISTER JOHNSTONE
To the best of my recollection Mr
Bond I suggested no such thing
(beat at the door)
In fact I was never here

M
Would you send in the new man from
equipment branch

MONEYPENNY (0S)
Right away

BOND
I hate to ask but Did you
ever think youd miss Communism

M
We serve the interests of the British
people 007 No matter who we may be
foolish enough to elect

hits a button on her intercom

Bond is silent chastised M looks away then looks back

M
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved
with that uranium I want him
prosecuted to the ends of the earth

BOND
Hopefully it wont get that far

M looks up MALCOLM SAUNDERS Qs successor limps in

like a

looking

mummy - plaster casts on his left leg left arm neck-brace

crutch

M
Come in Saunders
SAUNDERS
M 007

BOND
Okay Saunders What is it this
time Rocket in the leg Machine
pistol in the arm

SAUNDERS
Qs retirement party Id just put
the knife into the cake and -

BOND
Come on I know better than that -

Bond thwacks the crutch against the leg Saunders GRIMACES IN
PAIN

BOND
It must do something

SAUNDERS
Well If you insist

Saunders flexes his broken arm ARMORED SPIKES pop out of the
it

BOND
The die is cast

Saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with M He takes off the
cast

and neck-brace and places a BRIEFCASE on Ms desk

SAUNDERS

time to demonstrate your new Q toys

BOND

Saunders has opened the briefcase Bond tries to look inside

but
Saunders repositions it Saunders continues
SAUNDERS
In the meantime perhaps this will
spark your interest
(takes out a disposable lighter)
Cigarette lighter Thumb here press here -
A small flame appears Bond unimpressed reaches for it -
BOND
Saunders Ive lit cigarettes -
SAUNDERS
Not from forty feet
Saunders flips the lighter sideways and - WHOOSH A burst of
flame

shoots across the room

SAUNDERS
The disposable lighter also contains
a small self-detonation charge
(beat)
Depending on who - or what - you
wish to dispose of

Bond takes the lighter begins to play with it

SAUNDERS
Stop fidgeting 007 Next -

He takes out a pair of SHOELACES

BOND
Shoelaces

SAUNDERS
Plastique explosive shoelaces
(holding them out at length)
Cut them to regulate the size of the
blast totally harmless until you
attach the detonator hidden in the
heel of your shoe

BOND
(examining them curiously)
Perfect way to tie up a Knotty

problem

SAUNDERS

(frowns)
Moving along -

(he produces )
A typical plastic security card
Name here magnetic information
stripe here -

(pointing to)
And a code breaking microprocessor
here Swipe it through any card
reader - anywhere - youre in

BOND
Does it work on cash machines

Saunders is suddenly stricken Flustered He blurts out

SAUNDERS
It was an authorized test I returned the money

BOND
(amused)
I see

SAUNDERS
(ignoring this)
Finally your new watch Blue laser
here for signaling or burning
through locks press this button the
sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter

BOND
(needling him)
If you cant do the time dont do
the crime

SAUNDERS
(smirks at Bond pauses then)
Oh I almost forgot There is one last
thing Before Q retired he asked that
I give you one other protective device

He hands Bond a WEDDING BAND
BOND
A wedding band What am I supposed
to be able to do with this

SAUNDERS
I believe Qs exact words were
(imitating Q emphatically)
Hopefully nothing

Bond turns from Saunders devious grin to an amused M Smiles

BOND
Ill give you a ring from Venice

M
Good luck on your mission 007

He snaps the ring down on her desk

BOND
Till death do us part

CUT TO

EXT VENICE HARBORGRAND CANAL - NIGHT

A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters and a

huge

tarped hold - dominates the harbor (Harmsways SEA DOLPHIN II)

Tonight however we find a GONDOLA gliding through the
water

Arriving at a festively-lit dock crowded with gaily costumed

partygoers and musicians in medieval garb

Wearing the mask from Ms office (and a bright blue cape) Bond

alights the gondola and plunges into the crowd

EXT PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT

A swirl of colors noise and music Pushing his way into the
chaotic

celebration Bond scans the crowd looking for a face

NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS White Yellow Red Blue

Caught up in the tumult he turns left he strains to turn
right

anxiously looking for the contact Who is it

THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond They curtsy and
giggle

WOMAN
Buona sera signore -
Hes spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle

MAN
Vino

Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction by a
group of celebrants carrying a long banner

Suddenly the CROWD SURGES FORWARD A PROCESSION carrying the
EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square

Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd Bond struggles to look
forward - left right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from

behind

save

ranks

and

He can only crane his neck to seehear -
MASKED WOMAN
I may have been followed Meet me at
the Church in five minutes
With an effort Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing
the wisp of a satin costume disappearing as the crowd closes
behind him

SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT

Five minutes later Almost deserted A few stray couples The
MASKED WOMAN appears walking tentatively between the shadows

the moonlight looking for Bond Suddenly -
Whomp - an arm reaches out and yanks her into an alcove

BOND
Looking for someone

Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank) the woman - PARIS
removes her mask She shines a sexy 1000-watt smile at 007

PARIS
Hello James

Bond reacts He is not happy to see her

BOND
Paris What are you doing here

PARIS
Is that any way to say hello
BOND
I thought your specialty was good-bye

Paris smiles coyly She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair -

PARIS
Oh James Ive missed you -

BOND
(grabbing her by the wrist)
Is this another one of your games

PARIS
Stop it Youre hurting me Cant
you just be nice

BOND
Ive got half the British government
breathing down my neck I dont have
time for your nonsense

Shes surprised - and hurt - by his coldness

PARIS
Dont you even miss me Didnt I
mean anything to you

BOND
Nothing

She turns away from him fighting back tears Bond doesnt care

BOND
What about Elliot Harmsway Or is
this just another one of your stunts

PARIS

(anguished)
No Hes crazy - hes insane He
hates everybody Hes got these
plans -
(facing Bond becoming hysterical)
Youve got to help me James Im
sorry Im sorry for everything I
now I was wrong - but youve got to
protect me I know you still love -

BOND SLAPS HER Shes stunned He waits Shes angered

PARIS
Do you feel better now

BOND
(not giving an inch)
Do you

She turns away Bond feels remorse for hitting her Softens

BOND
What about the uranium

PARIS
Its on the boat Hes holding a
press conference tomorrow

Bond reaches out to touch her She falls into his arms burying
her
face in his shoulder

PARIS
Im so sorry James I promise Ill
never leave you again

BOND
(patting her head)
Shhhhh

PARIS
Just hold me

Bond thinks for a moment then gently pushes her away a foot
backwards to look in her eyes

BOND
How do you know Harmsway

Paris eyes flicker at something over Bonds shoulder She
swoons

PARIS
Kiss me

She pulls Bond to her kissing him - then HAULS OFF BELTING him
across the mouth

PARIS
Bastard Leave me alone

She shoves him off darts away Bond is bleeding from his mouth
and not altogether surprised at her behavior He turns to see -

ANOTHER ANGLE - SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - (BONDS POV) -
Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats

enveloped from head-to-foot in BLACK CAPES Their faces are

completely concealed behind flat bone-white masks covering all
but

their chins They look like messengers of death

CLOSER ON PARIS AND THE MEN -

The leader is STAMPER the others are locals THUG 1 2 3
(THUG

1 is built like a bank vault) Stamper looks steadily at Bond

STAMPER
Who is he

PARIS
Nobody Just some drunk Leave him
alone -

STAMPER
(to Thug 3)
Take her to the boat

RETURN ON BOND -

He sees STAMPER and the TWO HENCHMEN approaching He turns and
walks
quickly toward -

EXT RIALTO BRIDGE - FIRST (UP) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Pushing past carnival-goers Bond rushes up the central
staircase of

the bridge At the top looking onto the main span he sees -

THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION approaching like a tidal
wave

BOND throws a look over his shoulder and SEES THE THREE MEN
rushing
up the stairs knocking people out of the way like bowling pins

completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top

BOND turns to face the men And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP

dramatically like Batman - blocking their view of the
procession

STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -

And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY just as the PROCESSION
SURGES
PAST HIM and spills down the stairs overwhelming Stamper and Co
BOND
(to himself flexing the cape)
So thats how he does it

Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd

Stamper and Thug 2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase -

but

Thug 1 bulls his way up shouldering through the crowd

RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase he looks back up

THUG 1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine
tossing

carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls Spotting Bond he charges -

But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER He goes

right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare
hands

pulling the men down after him

BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT

Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade He
sees

A GROUP OF TOURISTS posing for a photo by the bridge -

and just beyond this -

A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART

BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera offering to take
the

picture for him

BOND
Prego prego Permissio
TOURIST
Grazie

Bond takes the camera The tourists pose And with perfect
timing

Bond turns and - POP - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG 1s
face

just as he comes around the corner
Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -

BOND
Grazie -

And heads for the PUSHCART Wheeling it around he SHOVES IT at

the

thug who is still stumbling blinded by the flashbulb

The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN knocking him on his back The cart

stops on top of him pinning him down

BOND takes off threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET

Meanwhile THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart It
ERUPTS

in the air as Thug 1 jumps to his feet Hes getting really
pissed

off He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him
as -

007 disappears down the sidestreet

Thug 1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked
by TWO

MOTORCYCLISTS chatting away Barely stopping Thug 1 lifts one
of

the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS
IT

INTO THE CANAL

RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -

Stamper and Thug 2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see
Thug

1 disappear onto the side Street

Stamper motions for Thug 2 to come with him on a parallel
course

along the canals toward -

THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT

Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street Sticking
close

to the buildings he ducks into an alleyway
ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -
Shrinking back into the shadows Bond peers out into the Plaza

BONDS POV - THE PLAZA
Stamper and Thug 2 charge in Bond watches as they split up and
start looking for him

RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -

Suddenly a huge hand grabs 007s shoulder spinning him around
THUG 1 has Bond in his grasp with murder his eyes In one fast
move Bond side-steps ducks and twists out of the cloak

throwing
it over the Thugs head And as the Thug struggles to get out

from

under it Bond slams him head-first into a wall knocking him
out

(Hes left sitting upright slumped against the wall)

NEW ANGLE -

Bond heads off down the alleyway away from the Plaza toward
the

courtyard of Il Bovolo

RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -

Thug 2 enters spots the figure in Bonds cloak Very quietly
he

pulls out his gun kneels And as he brings the gun up to the

cloaked figures head chambering a round -

The cloak erupts with Thug 1 viciously biting Thug 2s gun-
hand

hurling him against the opposite wall

With a frustrated fury Thug 1 rips off the cloak and stands

THUG 2
Marco - I didnt know -
THUG 1
After him

They charge off

IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Bond enters from the alley scans the courtyard Three walls No

way out Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the
FOURTH

FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY overlooking the courtyard

THE SPIRAL STAIRS -
Bond takes the marble steps two at a time
RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -

The two Thugs enter the square Motioning for quiet they HEAR
BONDS FOOTFALLS on the steps and race up after him

THE BALCONY -

Coming off the staircase Bond tries the doors to the interior
of the

building Locked Too heavy to burst in He glances down at the

courtyard and HEARS THE THUGS FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs

Bond glances up to the roof just above his head The only
escape

Pocketing his mask Bond hops on the BANISTER REACHES for the
GUTTER He pulls himself up throws a leg over - onto the roof

and

disappears from sight

Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase

FIRST ROOFTOP -

Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof There
are

SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story
drop

to an adjoining building Bond jumps
SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

007 lands on another steeply pitched roof unable to get a
foothold

on the tiles he slides down rolling to the edge He looks
down

The adjoining building is one story lower with a skylight roof

As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -

RETURN ON THE BALCONY -

Thug 1 holsters his gun and climbs on the banister Hes too
heavy

to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug 2 shoves him from

below

FIRST ROOFTOP -
Thug 1 searches for Bond He HEARS BOND moving below him on

the

next building He makes a running leap

SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug 1 lands They

grapple The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the

roof then loses his balance and slides down after Bond

AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF Bond is about to slide off onto the

skylight below but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment

007 is now hanging fifteen feet above a glass skylight As
Thug 1

tumbles off the edge of the roof and saves himself by GRABBING
ONTO

BONDS LEGS

They sway in the air for a second The GUTTER bends breaks and
the

two of them fall -

CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT INTO -

VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT

They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the

Great Hall Bond is winded Thug 1 unfazed He grabs Bond by
the

collar hauling him up on his feet

Thug 1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bonds chin forcing
007 up
on his toes Snarling he thrusts his face menacingly close to

Bond
THUG 1
I owe you some pain
With lightning speed Bond 1) Grasps the Thugs elbow and yanks
ns gun arm forward as 2) Bond pitches his head back Bonds chin
just

clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING

The flash momentarily blinds Thug 1 Bond snatches a
CANDELABRA
and smashes it against the Thugs arm knocking the gun away

As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER the Thug grabs Bonds wrist and
brutally
(yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007s hand ONTO THE

FLOOR

With a sick smile the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the
room

Hes having fun

AS BOND STAGGERS PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -

THUG 1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond

BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug 1 - who bats it
out

of the way like a gnat

Concerned this might be getting serious BOND grabs an OAK LEG
from

the shattered table He wields it like a bat to ward off the
Thug

Unimpressed the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY
TABLE

and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed King Arthur type
sword

With one roundhouse blow THUG 1 SLICES BONDS TABLE LEG IN
TWO

The Thug swings the Claymore a second time forcing Bond back
to

A DISPLAY WALL -

filled with pole weapons Bond snatches a lethal-looking
HALBERD

(Ax fluke and spike on a staff) Thug 1 stops in his tracks

Drops the Claymore Grabs a pole-ax

THE TWO MEN face off in a short furious battle which ends with
Thug

1 shattering Bonds Halberd with the pole-ax

NEW ANGLE -

Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands Thug 1 forces
Bond

backward to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN

(Something like a hinged sarcophagus lined with spikes)

Thug 1 tries to push 007 into the case but Bond side-steps at
the

last minute Thug 1 lurches forward and is only stopped from
killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron

maiden

(A

the

FROM

THE

floor

TO

As Thug 1 steps back Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall
studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)

Bond swings the Morning-Star down SNAPPING THUG 1S POLE-AX IN
TWO But loses the weapon in the process

Now Thug 1 lunges for Bonds throat Grappling they slam into
wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE
THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright -

In a near death-grip Bond manages to pushkicksmash Thug 1
backwards down onto the floor

AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -

THUG 1 LUNGES FOR BONDS GUN ON THE FLOOR

BOND CANT GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL HE TURNS TO SEE

THUG 1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM

And at the very last second BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX SLASHES
IRON MAIDENS LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -

NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDENS POV -

The iron maiden falls forward impaling Thug 1 on the wooden

RETURN TO SCENE -

The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug 1 except for his arm still
clutching Bonds gun Bond bends down and retrieves it

BOND

He fought hard
(holstering the gun)
But the case was terminal

And on this note we -

DISSOLVE

EXT VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY -
Under a beautiful blue sky the gleaming white SEA DOLPHIN II

sits at

onboard

At the same time however 500 feet away

INT DOCKSIDE CAFE -

Bond meets with Signore DiGIACOMO a middle-aged Italian
Intelligence

official in shirtsleeves Two underlings hover in the
background

BOND
Youve confirmed all the legal
details with M

DiGIACOMO
Si Bueno Shes very
Competent For a woman
BOND

Lets go over this one more time

DiGIACOMO
You will investigate the boat
Youll signal us if you find the

He looks at a WOMAN who has appeared with a baby in her arms

ITALIAN WOMAN WBABY

DiGIACOMO
(teasing re the baby)
Both of you
ITALIAN WOMAN WBABY

DiGIACOMO
Grazie grazie Ciao

She leaves He turns back Bond

DiGIACOMO
So Youll signal us if you find the
uranium -

BOND
And youll wait until after the press
conference - and everyone is gone -
before you board the boat and arrest
him

DiGIACOMO
Perfecto Then we turn him over to you
and the English government puts him on a
military transport back to London

Bond nods looks over at the Sea Dolphin II

DiGIACOMO
Do not worry my friend I only want
what is best For both of us

Bond stands to leave DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if hes
savoring some private secret He snaps his fingers to an
underling

DiGIACOMO
Rocco Un Cappuccino

THE SEA DOLPHIN II -
As Bond makes his way up the gangplank -

ELLIOT HARMSWAY is holding a press conference near the bow
surround-

ed by dignitaries He is a man with an EVIL EUPHORIA - showing
off

all the charm and charisma thats made him one of the worlds
most

powerful media tycoons

HARMSWAY

And so its somewhat fitting that
we are here today To christen this
environmental research boat in Venice -
- Venezia - the port where Marco
Polo sailed forth to explore the
worlds great uncharted oceans

(beat)
That 23 of the earths surface where
the sharks are not working members of
the press
Laughter Bond studies the man Harmsway continues pointing to
LARGE DRILLBORING OBJECT the size of a jet engine attached to
long flexible hosetube

HARMSWAY
With our six custom designed sea-bed
coring drills we will probe the
long-term effects of pollution our
sonars radars and research labs
will study the wind the water and
the sea life that so dearly feeds us

Bond moves through the crowd He spots a bulkhead with a door

HARMSWAY
And so in the spirit of international
cooperation - thanking my good friend
Valentin Zukofsky - the newly elected
President of the Ukraine for all his
assistance -

He motions to Zukofsky who nods to the audience

HARMSWAY
I give this boat to mankind - selflessly
- in pure charity asking nothing for
myself But the cable TV rights

Big laugh from the assemblage Harmsway turns to a BEAUTY QUEEN

HARMSWAY
Miss Venice If youll do the honors -

SMASH She cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow
CHEERS

HARMSWAY
Now Ill take some questions from the
press - even the few of you who
arent on my payroll

Laughter Harmsway points to a reporter

REPORTER 1
Mr Harmsway Why did you name this
boat the Sea Dolphin II

HARMSWAY
Actually my first choice was No
Comment So if someone asked where
I was I could truthfully respond No
Comment

(laughter he points)
Over there

REPORTER 2
Sir Elliot Is it true youre in
negotiations to move your offices
from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur

HARMSWAY
(impishly)
No comment
Amidst more laughter Bond disappears into the bulkhead door
INT SEA DOLPHIN II - BELOW DECKS -
Bond moves cautiously down a STAIRCASE
And peers along a CORRIDOR He sees a GUARD checking doors

making
sure theyre locked Bond withdraws for a moment looks back

The
guard is at the far end of the hall He lifts a WALKIE-TALKIE
GUARD
Level one secure
The guard exits down another staircase Bond moves stealthily
down
the corridor glancing at signs on various doors FISH HATCHERY
WEATHER STATION CREWS MESS etc Until he comes to
METALLURGY LAB Theres a CARD READER by the door Bond slips
out
his Q-toy swipes it Click He goes inside
INT METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - CONTINUOUS
Bond clocks the lab Power tools test benches a SECOND ENTRY
DOOR And in the middle of the room -
THE RED BOX
Quickly (as the echoes of Harmsways press conference can be
heard

through the portholes) Bond examines the edges of the box
looking
for tamper-proof seals Finds none Gingerly he opens it

URANIUM SLUGS They look like black tennis ball canisters
BOND presses a button on his watch THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS
WILDLY

Bond pauses Wants to make sure He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER
on

a bench he moves its probe over the uranium slugs Same result

Bond closes the box He decides to check out the rest of the
room —
examining gadgets tools chemicals HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -

And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS WITH ELONGATED
TEETH

(They look almost like a series of sharks jaws - one oval set
inside

another )

Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight He wonders

what it
is used for Just then -

THERES A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR Bond quickly replaces the
cutting saw moves to the first door -

And as the SECOND DOOR OPENS Bond slips out the first into the
CORRIDOR down the hall heading for the stairs

BACK IN THE METALLURGY LAB -

YUNG enters his hairless head shining under the lights He
looks

around sensing something is wrong Glances Not the red box
Not

the Geiger counter But then he notices it

THE DRAWER is sticking out maybe a sixteenth of an inch
Yung picks up a telephone
SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

Bond emerges from the bulkhead door The press conference
wrapping
up As Bond makes his way to the RAIL looking out on the cafe -

HARMSWAY
The maiden voyage begins tonight I
have some business in London - but
the ship will sail down the Nile
across the South China Sea stopping
in Australia winding up in San
Francisco
Bond stands at the rail AIMS HIS WATCH at the cafe -

HARMSWAY (contd)
But having said that - lets get to
the real business - the only thing
that attracts newsmen faster than a
breaking story the free food and
beverage

INT CAFE -
DiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER Motions his men to action
RETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars trying to
remain
ac inconspicuous as possible A hand clasps his shoulder

VALENTINS VOICE
Mr James Bond

Bond spins to see Valentin surrounded by the usual assortment
of
cheaply dressed goons

BOND
Valentin What an unpleasant surprise

VALENTIN
What is it that brings you to
Venezia Mr Bond Business -
(sly glance to the thugs)
Or somebody elses business

The goons chortle Bond isnt happy with this attention He
clocks

a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS scanning the
deck

A WOMANS SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin
She
is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos

SOFIA
Dimitri You promised I could go
shopping

VALENTIN

(sotto to Bond)
New mistress
(to her impatiently)
So Go

SOFIA
I need money

Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF
CASH

VALENTIN
Here Take an inch

Shaking his head Valentin turns back to Bond

VALENTIN

Come Let me buy you a drink Its
free

With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera they move
several steps to the bar

VALENTIN
(to the bartender)
Two vodka martinis Shaken Not stirred
(to Bond)
And you

Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his
regular behavior might arouse suspicion

BOND
One

As the bartender pours

BOND
I must say Valentin capitalism
seems to be treating you well

VALENTIN
(belting one back)
I used to sell weapons now I buy votes
(then)
Off the record

BOND
Of course If you cant beat the
government you might as well own it

Valentin spots someone off-camera

VALENTIN
Wait - I want you to meet a friend of
mine

(calling out)
Elliot Elliot Come here

Harmsway appears Ebullient as ever

VALENTIN
Elliot Harmsway I want to introduce
you to an old friend -

BOND
(putting out a hand to shake)
The name is Bond James Bond

Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile Yet his words are
ambiguous

HARMSWAY
Always nice to meet one of her
Majestys fellow subjects
(a nod to Valentin)
Especially one with such
distinguished friends

BOND
You might say Ive always been one of
Mr Valentins biggest followers

VALENTIN
(chortling)
Biggest followers Hes

He laughs Bond decides to pull Harmsways chain

BOND
Its a beautiful boat Sir Elliot
Practically glows in the dark

HARMSWAY

(smiles)
I can tell youre a man with an eye
for exquisite possessions Mr Bond

(signaling off camera)
Darling Come here

(beat)
I want you to meet my wife

A woman appears in frame her face obscured by a large sun hat
As

she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond -
HARMSWAY
Paris Harmsway allow me to introduce
you to James Bond

There is a terrified look on her face Harmsway continues
beaming
his most insinuating smile

HARMSWAY
But then I believe you two have

already met

There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks

Then -

POLICE WHISTLES BLOW SIRENS SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A
HALT

The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the

gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform trailed by
UZI-

TOTING CARBINIERI along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS

DiGIACOMO

of the Italian government I Franco
DiGiacomo -

POP A flash goes off)

Seize the boat

A set of frozen glances goes from Bond to Paris to Harmsway

VALENTIN
I think I suddenly remembered an
urgent meeting in Moscow

To everyones surprise Harmsway guffaws

HARMSWAY
My friends theres been a terrible mistake
(putting his arm around DiGiacomo)
Come Let me show you

And he leads the procession off through the bulkhead door Bond
is
left with Paris She is white with fear Bond moves to console
her

BOND
Paris -

PARIS

BOND
Why didnt you tell me Why wasnt

(beat)
Youve got to protect me

Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway He pulls out a
key

BOND

Paris looks up at him like a hurt child She wants some contact
she
wants to hear him say I love you

PARIS
Just - say it Say it just once

He opens the red box Hoists out a canister

HARMSWAY
Is it uranium Absolutely But watch -
(runs the Geiger counter over it)
Its depleted uranium Completely
safe A child could sleep on it

Bond cant believe what hes seeing DiGiacomo is mortified

HARMSWAY

I received it from the Russian
government - a by-product of their
nuclear arms program - in the hopes
that I could create tools for
oceanographic research

to move that gold Otherwise any

At least we know where the gold is
When are the recovery ships due

I expect to have that gold recovered
in 36 hours Until then Im
imposing my own electronic silence
For the sake of the economy not a

seems to be such an expert on these

He has great faith in Hong Kong As did
my ancestors With obvious results

Nervous chuckles around the table but the General is reserved

Were back in Bond-land A high-tech control room with lots of
monitors and white-suited TECHNICIANS Bond and Wade are pushed
through the-door followed by Taro and the two goons

TARO
Here they are Captain

The Captain turns from a monitor ITS SIDNEY

SIDNEY
Just give me one goad reason - Mister
Bond from Lloyds of London - why I
shouldnt kill both of you burn your
boat and use your bodies for shark bait

BOND
(to Wade)

You have to excuse Miss Winch She

thinks shes on a seduce and

destroy mission through life
(pauses)

-But she wont kill us

SIDNEY
No

BOND
No First because I dont think
its in your nature And second
because theres no gold down there

SIDNEY
So charming So suave
(beat)
Dont insult me Im not one of your
little London girls who falls for
the lies

WADE
So it was commitment

SIDNEY
Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong
knows whats on that boat and Im
claiming it One-third of that gold is
mine

BOND
Thats fine but - even a little
London girl knows that one third of
nothing is still nothing

Theres a flicker of doubt in her eyes She turns to Taro

SIDNEY
Was he carrying anything

Taro holds up the BONDS DIVING BELT indicating nothing
Angrily

SIDNEY
Search him

The men look at Bond - wearing only swim trunks Nobody moves

SIDNEY
Do I have to do everything around here

BOND
I hope so

Frowning Sidney moves to Bond As she REACHES INTO HIS TRUNKS
we
cut to THEIR FACES THEIR EYES ARE LOCKED ON EACH OTHER

BOND
I hope youll be gentle

SIDNEY
Think about mom
BOND WINCES Shes goosed him

BOND
Unusual technique

Returning to the WIDE SHOT she opens the sack SHOWS THE GOLD

SIDNEY
And what do you call this

BOND
- The family jewels

She scowls takes out the URANIUM TOOTH Looks at it blankly
and
holds it out to a TECHNICIAN who examines it

SIDNEY
What is this

TECHNICIAN
-I dont know Im not sure -

Just then a CREWMAN BURSTS IN

CREWMAN
Boss We got company - comin up off
the starboard bow

SIDNEY
(exiting to Taro)
Bring them

Taro motions with his Uzi for Bond and Wade to follow

But BOND hesitates LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the
URANIUM

007 wants to get it but Taro nudges him out with the gun
muzzle

Its only a warning shot but -

EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK Except for Bond and
Wade who might as well be having tea Bond looks down at Taro

CAPTAIN MORTON
(snidely)
Thanks for your message

BOND

CAPTAIN MORTON
Guard Arrest these men Escort

Bond and Wade are stunned The Marines move in Bond struggles -

BOND
Wait a minute -

CAPTAIN MORTON
Get them out of here If he says one
word shoot him

As TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across
the
folding bridge -

SIDNEY
(demanding)
Whats your name

CAPTAIN MORTON
Captain Morton

Pause She expects him to ask And yours but he doesnt

SIDNEY
My name is Sidney Winch and -
CAPTAIN MORTON
Good for you Miss Winch You now
have exactly 30 seconds to get this
rust bucket out of here

SIDNEY
(furiously)

I know my rights These are
international waters The British
Navy abandoned that boat and Im
claiming it Under international
law I have the right to salvage
whats on that wrec

CAPTAIN MORTON
Fifteen seconds Perhaps you should
consider hiring an attorney

SIDNEY
I was an attorney

CAPTAIN MORTON
Hmmm I suppose this is a step above
that profession
(beat)
Ten seconds Are you leaving

SIDNEY
No

CAPTAIN MORTON
You leave me no alternative

CAPTAIN MORTON
(upholstering a walkie-talkie)
Cut her anchor

As Sidney yells NO - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life
One
short bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN

SIDNEY
You wont get away with this

CAPTAIN MORTON
(stepping onto the bridge)
Good-day Miss Winch I advise you
to get some steam up - before you run
aground

As she floats away Sidney calls out to the Captain Bond and
Wade
SIDNEY
You bastards Believe me - you
havent heard the last of me

EXT DECK - THE CUTTER - DAY -
Bond Wade and the Captain

WADE
- Nice trick with the arrest Very convincing

CAPTAIN MORTON
Its no trick Mr Wade Ive got
half a mind to throw both of you in
the brig

BOND
Dont you think youre overreacting

CAPTAIN MORTON

(with great sarcasm)
Yes The famous James Bond Ive heard
all about you sir You were under
direct orders to act as an observer -
and yet you had to go off on your own
like some half-assed CIA cowboy -

(Wade reacts)
Endangering the gold attracting that
lunatic woman and then putting ina
distress call for us to save your
bloody hide

BOND
(Calmly)
-Thats all well and good Captain
save for one thing
(beat)
Theres no gold down there

CAPTAIN MORTON
What are you talking about We went
through all this and the ship isnt
even down there

BOND
Yes the ship is down there But the
gold is gone

CAPTAIN MORTON
Thats absurd It took two squads of
forty men fifteen days to load that
gold

BOND
I know what I saw -

CAPTAIN
I dont care what you think you saw
Youre a damned amateur
(beat)
Just get off my ship Go back to
your trench-coats and your code names
- and leave the job to professionals

BOND
(exchanges a glance with Wade then)
Aye-aye Captain

INT PRESSROOM BALCONY -
The NOISE FROM THE PRINTING PRESSES is deafening Bond and the

INT DRESSING ALCOVE - OFF THE PRESSROOM -

Harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads
from
the press room to an elevator Theres a SINK in the room

HARMSWAY
Its funny Mr Bond Of all the
things I own nothing gives me as
much enjoyment as my newspapers

He moves to the sink to wash his hands Turns on the faucets

HARMSWAY (contd)
Ironic isnt it In the age of TV I
still cant get the ink out of my veins

Bond SMILES WRYLY looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink

BOND
Yes A man with ink in his veins
and blood on his hands

Harmsway smiles to himself acknowledging the jibe But
decides to
ignore it He turns off the faucet dries his hands -

HARMSWAY
We print 31 newspapers here another
two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite
plants around the world

He pulls on his £2000 Saville Row suit-jacket
BOND
And how many of those newspapers

carried Paris Harmsways obituary

HARMSWAY
All of them Mister Bond
(motioning inside)
After you

INT ELEVATOR -

The doors close Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling
Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm

HARMSWAY
Before I became involved with Paris
she was always involved with the most
inappropriate men

(beat)

Playboys Thrill seekers Middle
aged Peter Pans who only brought out
the worst in her

BOND
I see

HARMSWAY
I tried to save her But she remained a
manic depressive Fits inappropriate
behavior Delusions of grandeur

BOND
I wonder if it runs in the family

HARMSWAY
(bursts out in a laugh)
The only difference between a
psychopath and a genius Mr Bond is
the degree of success

He looks up at the digital readout going from 40 to 50

HARMSWAY
Still I do miss her I only wish
she could have lived to see all this

BOND
I can feel your pain

The doors open

HARMSWAY
By the way - what is it that brings
you to Kuala Lumpur Mister Bond

ancestors

Double doors at both ends (People passing through) As they
walk -

HARMSWAY
I call this the Rogues gallery

BOND
Yes I can see Youve hung the
rest of your relatives

HARMSWAY

(pointing to the first portrait)
My third great Uncle - the Earl of
Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of
Hong Kong from the Chinese

(moving to)
His son-in-law - George Harmsway -
made the first family fortune
running opium into Shanghai

(moving to)
His son Thomas who lost it smoking
the opium
And my grandfather Henry who opened the
first telegraph station and published
the colonys first English newspaper

(pausing wistfully)
It was a city of unlimited possibility

BOND
So why did you leave

HARMSWAY

Because its a dying city Since the
Chinese take-over who knows what can
happen tomorrow

(moving to the last two portraits)
In any case this is my father Charles A
royal bastard who started the first radio
and television stations Said Id never
amount to anything but

(passing his own portrait)
I turned it into this

He pushes through a door into
INT HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON -

A cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity At the
center

is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK (where a news broadcast is in
progress )

surrounded by scores of reporters desks a la CNN

Around the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking
out

on Kuala Lumpur All are broadcasting A Larry King-type chat
show

MTV SPORTS a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something
flambeed

With its walls of monitors equipment and control rooms the
effect
is overwhelming Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter

HARMSWAY

Welcome to the new world order Mr Bond

(starting to walk)
Churchill had his armies Caesar had his
legions I have my divisions

And these are my foot soldiers

(a wave of his hand)
2000 people working on 14 floors to feed
300 newspapers 4 cable news networks 87
magazines and 29 different cable TV
channels - in 35 languages

BOND
And still not a thing to watch

He glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM with a NASA-type WORLD

BOND
-Although it must be fun to have
all those satellites

HARMSWAY
Theyre merely tools to disseminate
information

BOND
(wryly)
Or disinformation If you wanted to
say beam down a signal to send a ship
off course Maybe one degree a minute
HARMSWAY

(guffaws)
Fantastic idea Mr Bond Perhaps I
should buy it for a book Its
totally preposterous but -

(off Bonds reaction)
You amuse me And now perhaps I
can amuse you

He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL Begins to type

HARMSWAY
Lets see First we have this
James Bond I believe hes a field

adjuster for Lloyds of London
INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BONDS MI-6 COVER -

Or perhaps youd prefer this James Bond -

HARMSWAY
Who I believe they call 007

Bond is not amused Harmsway is enjoying himself

HARMSWAY
You see Mr Bond you and I are both
men of action But your era is passing
Words are the new weapons satellites the
new artillery And make no mistake about
it In the right hands they can be as
deadly as your Walther PPK

BOND
Words to live by

HARMSWAY
Your choice
(glancing at his watch)
Look at the time Come Theres
someone I want you meet - about a
story Im thinking of publishing

As they leave Bond is frustrated by Harmsways I dont care
what

you think you know - I can crush you attitude And now
Harmsway

plans (and the operative word here is plans) to use Bond to
tie off

the one other loose thread in his perfect crime

INT HARMSWAYS OFFICE -

The DOOR opens and Harmsway enters followed by Bond He calls
to
someone we dont see

HARMSWAY
Hello dear Im sorry I took so long -

REVEAL SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk

SIDNEY
Thats okay Uncle Ell -

She freezes in mid-sentence seeing Bond Bond is equally
surprised

SIDNEY
What is HE doing here

HARMSWAY
I see you two have met

BOND
Briefly

HARMSWAY

(crossing to his desk)
Dont pout Sidney I invited him
here hoping he might shed some light
on your story Hes from Lloyds of
London

(sly glance to Bond)
Arent you Mr Bond

SIDNEY
Hes not going to tell the truth He
was diving for the gold
Harmsway sits and addresses Bond matter-of-factly

HARMSWAY
It seems - Mr Bond - that Miss Winch
has told me the most incredible story A
sunken British warship filled with gold
a British cutter firing on her billions
of dollars in bullion lying on the
bottom of the Strait

Bond isnt enjoying this charade

HARMSWAY
Obviously the British government
denies all of this -

SIDNEY
- I told you He was there -

HARMSWAY
- But as Ive explained to Sidney
without proof theres just no story
Dont you agree Mr Bond

Before Bond can answer -

SIDNEY
But I have proof You ran out of here
so fast I didnt get to show you

Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns
Harmsway

wasnt expecting her to have proof Bond knows that if she shows
him

the gold (or worse the uranium tooth) Harmsway will probably
kill

both of them to destroy the evidence and witnesses

HARMSWAY
(forcing a smile)

And whats that my dear

BOND
Sidney perhaps we should leave this to -

Sidney cuts Bond off DROPPING THE GOLD BAR on Harmsways desk

SIDNEY
He brought that up from the wreck

HARMSWAY
IT see
Alarmed Bond wants to stop Sidney from reaching into her bag

again -
BOND
Sidney I wouldnt -
Too late She drops the uranium tooth on his desk
SIDNEY
And what about this Any idea what this is
Silence Harmsway and Bond exchange a sober look Then
HARMSWAY
I believe its a depleted uranium
drill bit my dear
HE PRESSES AN ALARM UNDER HIS DESK Bond reaches for the DRILL
TOOTH

BOND
Why dont we just take these -

SIDNEY
(blocking him)
No I want Sir Elliot to keep them

Harmsway stands comes around the desk

HARMSWAY
Well I do believe this requires
further investigation

SIDNEY
Thank you Uncle Elliot

HARMSWAY

No matter what the British government
says I wont kill this story

(his secretary appears in the doorway)
Miss Oxford will show both of you to
the elevator And one of my people
will definitely be in touch sooner
than later

BOND
Im sure they will

HARMSWAY
Good-bye Mister Bond
He reaches to kiss Sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too
long

HARMSWAY
Good-bye darling

Watching them exit his smile turns hard and bitter

BOND
(yanking it down)
You heard me A gun
(disabling it)
I left mine in the car

SIDNEY
Thats funny you struck me as the kind
of man who always carries protection

BOND
Listen to me Im a British secret
service agent And we have about two
minutes before Harmsway kills both of us

He glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car

SIDNEY
Has anyone ever suggested that youre
a paranoid psychotic

Bond ignores the insult explaining as he moves under the panel

BOND
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the
gold Its on the Sea Dolphin II

And thanks to your little show and tell -
(straining to open the panel)
- giving him the evidence -
popping it open)

BOND AND SIDNEY (INT KITCHEN) -

SIDNEY
What the hell does that do

BOND
Cleans dirt Lets go

INT HALLWAY -

Bond and Sidney BREAK for the STAIRCASE DOOR (Where the first

Guards

go

were shooting at them from) TWISTING AROUND Bond lets a BURST

in Stampers direction as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead
guards MAC-10s

INSERT - BONDS BULLETS RIP UP THE JUG OF CLEANER
BOND AND SIDNEY ESCAPE FROM THE HALLWAY -
STAMPER -
Cowers waiting for the jug to blow up Then realizes
STAMPER
Its a trick After him
(into his radio on the run)

Theyre in the south stairwell

HARMSWAY IN THE SECURITY CENTER -
HARMSWAY
Get more men up there

INT STAIRWELL - LANDING -

SIDNEY
Down

Bond leans over the railing Sees GUARDS coming UP SHOOTS

BOND
Up

They go up about three stairs and Sidney sees GUARDS
descending

SIDNEY
Down
BOND
(shoots then)
Up

Bond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a METAL DOOR just

as -
INT HALLWAY -
Stamper and the Guard bound down the hallway heading for the
door
INT SECURITY CENTER -
Harmsway smiles watching Bond on a monitor
HARMSWAY
And so much for that
(into radio)
Theyre on the 72nd floor set-back
(explains to the guards)
Nowhere to go
EXT 72ND FLOOR - TERRACE SETBACK - TWILIGHT -
Its magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback
Bond

sees a WINDOW WASHERS RIG And although Sidney asks -

SIDNEY
Now what
Bonds first concern is to make sure Stamper cant get them
Amidst

a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN
He

grabs it and -

BANG BANG BANG He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the
frame

BOND
That should buy us some time

Now Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHERS RIG - a two-man bucket-
like

scaffold ON TRACKS with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside
and a

LARGE CABLE SPOOLMOTOR that stays on the roof

Approaching it Bond looks over the side
BONDS POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR -

Twenty stories below is the sky bridge 50 stories below that
the
ground Its a long long way down

RETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHERS RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK -

BOND
Help me move this

INT STAIRWELL -

Darting up the few steps Stamper and Guards arrive at the door
He
tries to open it Wont budge

GUARD
Ill call for a battering ram -

STAMPER
No Get the fire ax

One of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET He hands
the

AX to Stamper who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR

RETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

Bond is positioning the window washer rig He explains

BOND
Well go down close to the sky bridge
We may be able to swing over and use it
for cover

As Bond climbs into the bucket Sidney peers over the side

SIDNEY
No way I sail I do not fly

BANG Behind them Stampers AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR
BOND
Sometimes you just have to take

the plunge

Bond yanks her in flips switches on the control pod and starts
down as fast as they can go

EXT HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL -

Bond and Sidney descend Tiny specs against the sunset

INT STAIRCASE -

Stamper gives the last few chops to the door He kicks it open
EXT TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR -

Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge

BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR -

Bond looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their

progress

SIDNEY
All I know is one thing If we get
out of here alive that gold is mine
(beat)
Ive earned it

Looking upward Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail BOND
BOND
One thing at a time
EXT TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT -
Stamper jumps back from the ledge enraged Ax in hand he moves

the WINDOW WASHING RIGS MACHINERY -
And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but
instead of

cutting it the ax BOUNCES OFF and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS
TRACKS

THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) -

Swings Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out Bond grabs her

They

are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE swaying like a
giant

pendulum - although still descending

RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

Having failed at the cable Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding
it

He swings Swings again With each blow the pulley shaft
weakens

BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHERS RIG) -

Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn
bucket

STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX -

Finally the pulley shaft SHATTERS THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT
BOND AND SIDNEY -

are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge

SIDNEY
(panicked anxious fast)
What now And dont give me some
movie cliché like trust me

BOND
(what the hell)
Trust me

And with this he turns and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW

BOND
Lets go -

But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS THE CABLE
SUDDENLY
DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER BELOW THE WINDOW
loose

THE TERRACE SET-BACK -
Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum Its coming
from its moorings

BOND AND SIDNEY -

look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing

what

(she thinks) is certain death

SIDNEY
Were going to bounce off that thing

Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before
Stamper

cuts the cable HE GRABS HER

BOND
Hold on

TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum With a GREAT
CLAT-

TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS smashes into the
wall

and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING

THE WINDOW WASHERS RIG -

Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way They start to free-
fall

BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky
bridge

THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS -

BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH INTO -

INT 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE -

Landing on the deck of the bridge Bond rolls to his feet as -

Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck Bond

yanks Sidney to the side of the building just as THE CABLE
DRUM

PULLEY AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY

72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK -
Looking down Stamper flips open his radio

STAMPER
(over radio)
Theyre on the bridge Seal off the
50th floor

INT SECURITY CENTER -

HARMSWAY
(looking at the monitors)
I should have hired this man
(to his guards)
Get somebody up there

INT SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -
Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris

SIDNEY
What about the elevators

He steps to the side of the bridge and looks at the railings
Four
inch pipe Bond begins to work feverishly

BOND
We tried that already Remember

Bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses

SIDNEY
You know this is as much your fault
as it is mine

Bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe One loop

BOND
Sidney we dont have time for this -

He pulls on the loop to test it Good enough Makes a second
loop

SIDNEY
Sure Just when I want to talk -
(beat)
Not that I would have believed you -

Bond tests the second loop Hes satisfied Turns to her

BOND
Put your back to the railing Sit up
on it

SIDNEY
(doing it)
Are you listening to me

BOND
Put your arms around my neck Lock
your legs around my waist

SIDNEY
We have time for that

Just then GUARDS APPEAR OUT OF FAR ELEVATOR DOOR Running THEY

SHOOT BOND FIRES A BURST BACK as - A NEW ROUND OF BULLET HITS
BEGINS TO RAIN DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE

BOND LOOKS UP Stamper has commandeered a second window washers
rig and is descending FIRING AT THEM

Bond looks at Sidney -

BOND
Sometimes you just have to -

SIDNEY
Dont say it

She locks her arms and legs around him he snaps the leather

harness

the

around her waist and they roll over the railing Amidst gunfire
EXT HARMSWAY TOWERS - TWILIGHT

Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up

They go down

And down

And down -

RETURN ON THE RAILING - (INT SKY BRIDGE) -

The cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent

PAINT ON THE RAILING IS BURNING OFF and the STEEL itself is

STARTING

TO SMOKE from the friction

BOND AND SIDNEY - DROPPING -
Dropping -
And Dropping

Looking to the ground Bond sees the PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION
BALCONY

coming up fast from below It looks like theyre going to get

splattered on the tile floor when -

RETURN ON THE RAILING - SKY BRIDGE -

The cable comes to the end of its run It DRAGS THE SPOOL THE
BUCKET and all the other MECHANICS to the side of the bridge
SMASHING AGAINST THE WALL JAMMING AGAINST THE RAILING

EXT THE PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY - TWILIGHT -

Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt Theyre swinging about five feet
from the balcony Theres a pause

SIDNEY
s this - like - a normal day for you

BOND
ts a lousy job but -
(reaching for the balcony)
The only reason I stay is for the
health benefits

fq

Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY
INT SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

Stamper lands on bridge He unbuckles his harness runs to
railing

looks down and sees SIDNEY AND BOND climbing out onto the
balcony

going for the PRESS ROOM DOOR

STAMPER
(into his radio)
Theyre heading for the press room
Stop them

INT PRESS ROOM -
Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came
down

earlier to meet Harmsway

The Presses are running full blast the noise is deafening
At the start end of the presses - where the paper is fed in -
Bond
sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE about to be loaded

Directly beyond this is the door to the elevatorwash-up room
where
Bond and Harmsway exited earlier -

Coming out of that DOOR Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway
Blazers
carrying guns

BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL

It CRASHES TO THE GROUND rolling backwards on the guards As
they

start scrambling around it -

Bond and Sidney race down the stairs turning in the opposite
direc-—

tion (toward the finishing end of the press near the garage)

They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN with an oversized
crowbar

Bond and the Pressman square off Bond tries to get around him

The

man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it Bond tries to block
the

descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in
half

Bond and the Pressman engage in a short furious fight -
throwing
each other against the side of the press

Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second
and

pushes the man back into a pile of INK DRUMS Momentarily
stunned

Bond forces the mans head into an OPEN INK DRUM -

And as he comes up COVERED WITH INK gasping for air Sidney
bops
him on the head with the crowbar

Now Bond and Sidney take off toward the garageexit -
But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint)

darts out
from between the banks of the printing press tripping Bond
Bond stumbles face down - then spins over kicking up at the

Guard

as he comes to finish Bond off

The Guard stumbles backward -

Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE (A large machine
that

wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for
delivery)

Rushing the man Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP

the

BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up The only problem is
that

as Bond turns -

The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold hes aiming a gun at
Bond

Seemingly at once Sidney bites the Guards forearm Bond

ducks the Guard shoots wildly the gun drops and -

Bond rushes the man KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING
PRESS

pulling Sidney away at the last moment

The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers and

The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT
RED

BOND
He was bad news

Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase Bond grabs
Sidney
and the gun and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE

BOND
Down there

They jump into it sliding down and around an ALUMINUM CHUTE
into

INT GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS
Bond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers

Hearts pounding - having left the pressrooms deafening noise -
theyre ready for almost anything except what they HEAR
The SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING A polite almost bored
clapping

HARMSWAY (0S)
Vert very good Mr Bond Outstanding
performance

Harmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS shoulder to shoulder ina
straight line all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond

HARMSWAY (continuing)
Im the certain the British taxpayers
would be impressed by your efforts
Dont you agree

BOND
I think theyd rather know who stole
their gold

Harmsway cant help his ego

HARMSWAY
(chuckles)
Why I did of course Its on the
Sea Dolphin II twenty miles outside

of Hong Kong Not that it will do
either of you any good to know
(beat)

Now both of you Stand up And toss
the gun out Mr Bond

Bond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him And THROWS A
LOOK

TO HIS CAR noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH

Bond begins to scheme

SIDNEY
Uncle Elliot How could you do this
to me

Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket

HARMSWAY
Oh please Sidney Theres a
hundred billion dollars at stake
(beat)
Besides I never really liked your
father that much He cheated at cards

Bond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL He palms it
BOND
Are your guards really going to kill
a helpless girl

HARMSWAY
My guards are from South Africa Mr
Bond This is their chance to get even
with the formerly Great Britain
(beat)
Now both of you Put your hands on
your heads and step forward

Holding the remote control Bond puts his hands on his head
Hes
manipulating the control into the right position to use it

BOND
(trying to buy time)
What did you do Harmsway Make some
deal with the Chinese government for
the gold Was the radioactive
uranium I found in Venice part of it

He finally has the remote control in the right position

HARMSWAY
Questions questions Mr Bond
Which Im afraid Ive neither the
time nor the inclination to answer
(to the guards)
Take them out to the jungle and -

Suddenly BONDS CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR The GUARDS TURN
in

shock TOWARDS THE CAR as

BOND retrieves the gun he slid out and pulls Sidney behind the
newspaper trolley while -

THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE sending the guards scrambling
BOND takes his position with Sidney
BOND
I forgot to mention The job comes
with a car

007 begins shooting as -

HARMSWAY
Kill it Shoot the damn thing -
THE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR They manage to
shoot
out the headlights while -

BOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the
same

time As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them -

BOND
Here You shoot Ill drive

SIDNEY
You know thats another reason
youre probably not in a successful
relationship

BOND
Another reason Did I miss something

SIDNEY
(taking the gun)
You insist on calling all the shots
(beat)
And by the way I am not a helpless girl

Bond eyes her for one split second Points at the guards

BOND
Aim that way

Sidney starts to shoot as -

THE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car But

THE WINDOWS DONT SHATTER

THE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS

THE TIRES DONT GO FLAT

Theres chaos a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND
STEERS

(to Stamper checking
Bonds pulse)
Are they alive

STAMPER
Yes Shall we kill them

HARMSWAY

No I have a better idea In fact
Mr Bond may have actually improved
my original plan

Make sure he has nothing else up his
sleeve

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING -
It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where

floating
restaurant rise out of the fog where an old Chinese man wearing

an
LA Lakers jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient
junk
where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks computer
boxes
and women dressed in Chanel 1996 and Beijing 1256 While the
captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones
At the end of the harbor dominating this scene the CAMERA
FINDS
THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
Panning down this massive dockside facility the image changes
to

THE SAME SCENE ON A 5 PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR -

With one important difference Theres an HNN logo in lower
corner

NEW ANGLE (EXT POWER PLANT FRONT ENTRANCE WATERSIDE) -
Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER
interviewing a

the

over the shoulder news angle hes WEARING A HAT

(Theres also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground anda
seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier)

ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (contd)
- Interviewing Mr David Chin senior
engineer in charge of security

Tell me Mr Chin How safe is this
plant from a terrorist attack

He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin

CHIN
Totally secure Without codes youd
need a missile to blast through the
front door you normally cant even get
this close (to the plant) without a full
security clearance

ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER
Could you say that a little closer
to the microphone

He pushes the microphone closer to Chins face

CHIN
Of course Youd need -

Suddenly A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE
And
CHIN COLLAPSES The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT ITS YUNG

YUNG
(to the guards)
Now

At once the two cameramen turn One AIMS his shoulder-mounted

DOOR

BOOM ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses destroying both

YUNG
Lets go
As Yung and the cameramen rush forward -
ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT -

Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a

box
of equipment He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on
deck
HARMSWAY
Get the machine in the water
They begin using a hoist to lift one of the worms from a hold
(This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo with an antenna on
top
and no flexible tubing attached)
INT HALLWAYRECEPTION - POWER PLANT -

A Guard enters carrying a pile of Bonds clothing with his shoes

STAMPER
Put on your clothes
(to the guard)

Cuff him

The guard cuffs Bonds hands (in the front) and we cut back to

INT POWER PLANT CONTROL ROOM -

Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room Lots of con-
soles with a window overlooking the REACTOR CORE and its
surrounding blue COOLING POOL

YUNG
(to the half-dozen engineers)
Im sorry to interrupt again But we
need one more picture for the story

The engineers ad-lib replies Sure Okay Yung smiles
YUNG (CONTD)
Why dont you line up against the

The engineers line up against a wall The cameramen take
positions

for a massacre And at the first sound of gunfire we cut to

EXT ENTRANCEWAY -

Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in
handcuffs

BOND
Sleep well

Bond gives her a look
RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -
Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a

portable
version of the worm controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II
YUNG
The drill is in the water
approaching the intake tunnel

HARMSWAY
Excellent

Harmsway looks up hearing

BOND
I see youre in your natural element
Harmsway A room filled with lethal
power
(beat)
With a toxic core at its center

Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney who have entered
(handcuffed at
gun point) with Stamper and a guard Harmsway is charming as

ever
HARMSWAY
Do come in Mr Bond Sidney
Youre just in time for a nuclear
meltdown
Coming closer Sidney struggles against her cuffs swinging at
him —

SIDNEY
You bastard -

Stamper restrains her while Bond scans the room for an
advantage
He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console

HARMSWAY
Please Sidney Id like to remember
you fondly

YUNG

(calling from the console)
Approaching the first gate

HARMSWAY
Start the grinders

UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL -

The worm is nearing an iron sluice gate the eye closes the
grinders rev and it starts to eat through the bars
try

Young calls out again

RETURN ON CONTROL ROOM -

BOND
So thats what the weapons grade
uranium was for

HARMSWAY
Precisely Mr Bond In a matter of
minutes the boring device will

arrive at the core of the reactor

(beat)
And when the radioactive blades cut
into the plutonium -

BOND
- Instant melt-down

HARMSWAY

Chernobyl will look like a campfire

rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun

YUNG
Were through the first gate
Approaching the second -

BOND
(demanding)
Why Harmsway Wasnt stealing the
gold enough

HARMSWAY

(to Yung)
Bore through

(to Bond chuckling)
They used to say living well was
the best revenge Mr Bond

(beat)
Theyre wrong

(beat)
Revenge is the best revenge

YUNG
Entering the main tunnel - ten
minutes to target -

BOND
(fiercely)
What could you possibly have to be

vengeful for Harmsway Still trying

with a hint of urgency Bond decides to

unnoticed
to prove yourself to daddy
This infuriates Harmsway Bond moves closer to the gun

HARMSWAY
Hong Kong Mr Bond

YUNG
You have to leave -

HARMSWAY

(enraged ignoring Yung)
A hundred and fifty years ago my
ancestors took this island - a
barren lifeless rock - and turned it
into the greatest city known to
modern civilization

(beat)
And now that Im being forced to give
it back I intend to return it in
exactly the same condition A
barren lifeless rock

(beat)
The gold is merely reparations -
payment from the spineless British
government who wouldnt listen

BOND
(to Sidney glancing at the gun)
I think Uncle Elliot is having
his own melt-down

YUNG
Approaching the third gate -

HARMSWAY

Smash through it

(then)

Laugh all youd like Mr Bond - but
you fit perfectly in to my plans
(he reaches for a newspaper)
Here This just in Newsflash

Read all about it

He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond holding the top half
out as
Bond reads THE HEADLINES sourly

BOND

calls for British government to resign
Harmsway smiles at Bond

HARMSWAY
As the advertising says Tomorrow
never lies

BOND
What about the gold

YUNG
You must go Now Otherwise the
boat wont be out of range -

Stamper and the guard appear nervous itching to leave -

HARMSWAY

Thirty seconds

(then to Bond)
Thats the most brilliant part of the
plan Mr Bond To save the economy
Tll let the new British government -
my British government - announce that
the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong
- where no one will be able to touch
it for a hundred years

(beat)
And just by coincidence

He turns the paper over and readsreveals a smaller headline

HARMSWAY
Gold mine opens in Vietnam
(turns to Stamper)
Lets go Put them in the airlock

Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney Bond edges closer to the
BOND
Youll never get away with it

Harmsway Too many people know

Bond tenses ready to spring -

HARMSWAY
Who Mr Bond The kooks - the
crazies - the conspiracy theorists

The Oliver Stones of the world
(pausing then with great scorn)
Ill publish their books Ill make
off -

could

their movies Ill put them on my TV

shows
(beat)
Theyre my bellboys They carry my
luggage
Bond moves but - the guard picks up the gun Bond frowns

HARMSWAY
Now Get them in the airlock

Fortunately Bond has a back-up plan As Stamper hustles them
BOND
One problem Harmsway The girl And
the handcuffs Theyll give it away

Harmsway considers this for a second Sidney takes Bonds arm

SIDNEY
No I want to stay with him

Bond looks at her Hes surprised In the blink of an eye he
realizes hes developed feelings for her He knows that if he

hold her hed kiss her and whisper Youre a hell of a

girl

hes

But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows
running out of time against the worm and is better off alone

HARMSWAY
(breaking the moment cynically)
How sweet

SIDNEY
(satto to Bond)
My timing always was lousy

BOND
(cold and hard)
Id rather die alone

HARMSWAY
Take the girl Leave the handcuffs
Well drown her at sea

SIDNEY
(to Bond sarcastically)
Enjoy the rest of your life
As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock he hears

HARMSWAY
Ill meet you on the boat south of

As Bond grabs the gun bringing it up to shoot Yung dives on
top of

him They struggle and the gun skitters across the floor
towards

the window overlooking the blue cooling pool

Breaking free Bond moves around a console for the gun Yung
takes a

shortcut - leaping on and then over the console as -

THE WORM (UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL) -

Chews through the last of the iron bars and glides through the
hole

toward THE SILVERY REACTOR CORE 35 feet ahead

BOND AND YUNG -

have squared off in a short brutal MARTIAL ARTS battle
(The fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the
reactor core window the gun lies on the ground between them)

They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his
own

Yung is every bit his equal

Backing off Bond spins into a crescent kick -

But Yung catches Bonds foot and shoves Bond backwards
crashing

against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER

Meanwhile all through this

THE WORM IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE CORE

RETURN ON BOND AND YUNG -

As Yung reaches down for the gun Bond grabs the fire
extinguisher

from the wall He rushes Yung blasting him with COo2

In the white smoke Yung drops the gun Then CHARGES at Bond

BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW

THE WINDOW SHATTERS Bond is winded And as he struggles to stop
himself from falling backwards into the reactor room

Yung does a FLYING FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -

But at the last second BOND DUCKS reaches up and uses Yungs
momentum to send him flying over Bonds head into -

He sails through the air heading for the cooling pool 20

EXT PASSAGEWAY -

With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him Bond is stealthily
moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship

(Bond has two goals in mind at this point First to neutralize
any
threats and second to save Sidney if shes still alive)

Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR Bond checks both directions down
the
passageway then pokes his head inside -

And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY
thrown
against a railing

Bond looks up

STAMPER stands with a smile on his face One arm is raised above
his

head grasping the WORM on the swinging boom The worm is
attached

to the boom by a thin metal cable

STAMPER
Youre mine now

Bond rushes at Stamper slamming into him The man doesnt
flinch

With his free hand he grabs Bond by his shirt and throws him

against a steel wall Bond crashes to the deck

As Bond recovers Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON

Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm
Bond tries to stand but Stamper flings him back down pinning
Bond

against the wall with his free hand as he -

Im going to do this slowly -
Bond executes a scissor kick to Stampers ankles Stamper

tumbles

and is

sideways Bond rolls away from the worm -
But by the time Bond gets to his feet Stamper has recovered
rushing at Bond full force with the worm

Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once Bond ducks The worm

chews

into the wall

Pulling the device back Stamper thrusts a second time - (same

action) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond

Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS and -

With the water cascading over the camera (as if we were riding
inside an ocean wave) the worm heads for a tank marked FUEL

Harmsway looks up at him Blinks in disbelief
BOND

I never believe what I read in the

newspapers
Harmsway slowly brings up the gun

HARMSWAY
Pity youll miss your obituary

Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt Moves closer

(moving in on him)
Where is she Harmsway —
He grabs Harmsway by the lapels and throws him against the
wall crashing onto the instrument panel head first
Harmsway laughs maniacally face down on the gauges
HARMSWAY
What is it Bond You havent the
guts
Boom Theres another explosion in the background The front of

Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder -

BOND
You spineless paper tiger -

And yanks him off the instrument panel flinging him backwards
against the rear wall of the bridge

BOND
Where is she Harmsway Or did you
kill her like Paris
Suddenly THE BOAT GROANS The BRIDGE RISES OUT OF THE WATER
BOND loses his balance FALLING ONTO HARMSWAY -

We all go down together
Harmsway lunges for Bonds throat -
AND THE BRIDGE SLIPS UNDERWATER -
Where Bond breaks Harmsways grasp in a violent struggle - then
punches him Air bubbles break from Harmsways mouth He
frantically tries to break free for the surface -

But Bond pulls him back down and holds him down pushing down

Bond in a haze of bubbles

Then falls still

With his lungs aching bursting with fire Bond rockets up -

through the bridge windows up to -

THE SURFACE

He breaks through the water gasping for air And then almost
instantly dives down again

UNDERWATER - (BONDBOAT) -

Bond dives for the boat - down and down chasing it as if he
just grab it and stop it from sinking

He goes deeper and deeper as it sinks further and further
just beyond his reach

And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold
breath a second longer -

A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM

Bond turns in disbelief Stares into the mask ITS SIDNEY She
puts her regulator in Bonds mouth

And they share the air as they rise from the depths

They break through the water Sidney yanks off her mask Teases

SIDNEY
What do you mean youd rather die

SIDNEY
Before we go any further here Mr
Bond from Lloyds of London I just
want to get two things straight

BOND
Yes

SIDNEY
First that boat is in international
waters Im claiming it for salvage
One-third of that gold is mine

BOND
And number two

SIDNEY

If you think were going to have some
kind of life affirming romance here
just because we cheated death let me
be clear

Were going to have it where I want
and when I want

And when might that be
