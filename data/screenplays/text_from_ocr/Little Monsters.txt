on an old alarm clock TICKING the bells gone the little hand
missing the big hand indicating twenty-after-something It is
bound with black electrical tape time-bomb fashion to a

INT STEVENSON HOME - ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

A huge poster shows the history of train engines A stairway is
cut into the floor No curtains on the window A just-past-—
half moon shines in the night sky

Brian pulls on a pair of thick wool socks He skates past a
cluttered worktable across the hardwood floor to the stairs

INT HALLWAY

Brian moves quietly past a closed door on it a plaque reads
Erics Room above a picture of an antique car

Farther down is another closed door Brian pauses listening to
the sounds of Mom and Dad arguing no words can be made out
only the tones the rise fall sharpness of voices

Brian looks away from the door Prepares for his assault on the
stairs He reaches his foot down--and the step CREAKS loudly
Brian freezes He moves his foot to the left puts his weight
on it Silence He goes right for two more skips the next
stair altogether making his way to the bottom of the minefield
of possible creaks and groans

INT KITCHEN

Brian whips up a balogna-mustard-onion sandwich He glances at
the clock--1227--working under a deadline

INT LIVING ROOM

Brian--silently--pushes an armchair up to the television He
turns the volume knob down holds the remote control an inch

from the set thumbs it Brian adjusts the volume so its
barely audible-- just in time for the opening of Late Night
With David Letterman

He sits back Unseen by Brian a quick subtle movement-- just
a shadow really--heads for the stairs

Brian takes a bite of the sandwich--
--and then there is a SCREAM that could wake the dead

Brian shoves the chair back remotes the set off on the run
tosses the control on the couch and races for the stairs

EXT STEVENSON HOME - NIGHT

A rambling two-story midwestern house with screened-in front
porch stands dark on a large wooded lot The SCREAMING
continues going hoarse A second-story bedroom light comes on

INT STEVENSON HOME - STAIRWELL

Brian is only halfway up the stairs when his escape route is cut
off light from his parents room spills into the hall Brian
melts back into the shadows HOLLY and GLEN STEVENSON hurry to
the already open door of Erics room

INT ERICS BEDROOM

No curtains in here either ERIC STEVENSON nine years old
with light brown hair and fine features sits huddled in bed
breathing hard blinking in the sudden glare of the overhead
light

ERIC
Mom There was a monster

Holly relaxes smiles She is a dark-eyed woman on the other
side of thirty pretty giving way to elegant She gestures to

Eric

HOLLY
Skootch over

Holly sits down on the bed beside Eric She hugs him

HOLLY
It was just a bad dream
ERIC
But I wasnt sleeping

HOLLY
Sometimes you dream youre awake
but youre not

Glen slightly older than Holly bearded stands slumped against
the door frame He is a polished man but worn the veteran of
too many such late night disturbances

GLEN
It was probably just the house
settling Youre not used to it
yet

ERIC
It wasnt the house--there was a
monster It zoomed in from the
hall and went under my bed

Holly and Glen exchange a look

GLEN
Ericwhen you dream its just
your brains way of sorting out
things you learned during the day
So if you found out something--

ERIC
I found out theres a monster
under my bed It ran in from the
hall--it grabbed my ankle

HOLLY
Theres no monster under your bed
Here

She gets down on one knee and--

ERIC
No Mom Dont

--sticks her arm into the under-the-bed She sweeps it back and
forth pulls it out It is rather dusty

HOLLY
See No monsters
(notices the dust
brushes it off)
All the dust bunnies scare ‘em
away

ERIC
(a new threat)
bunnies

INT HALLWAY

Brian rolls his eyes He sneaks toward the attic stairs

INT ERICS BEDROOM

GLEN
There are no bunnies and no
monsters Theres nothing under
your bed

HOLLY
Maybe we should get the
flashlight

Eric crosses his arms and gives Glen a grave nod
GLEN
Holly if we humor him--

(off her look)
All right

INT HALLWAY
Brian commando-rolls into the bathroom disappearing just before
Glen steps into the hall
INT ERICS BEDROOM
Holly pulls the covers up to Erics chin tucking him in
HOLLY
You want to know a secret The
monsters are more afraid of you

than you are of them

Eric looks very doubtful He inches the covers down to free his
arms
HOLLY
Once you realize they dont exist
theyre gone Thats a lot of
power I wish I could do that to
the heating bill

She pulls the covers back up to Erics chin Glen returns
presents the flashlight to Eric

GLEN
Easy on the batteries kid

Eric takes the flashlight grips it tightly
HOLLY
Well leave the hall light on and

the door open

HOLLYGLEN

ERIC
Gnight

Glen turns off the room light

INT HALLWAY
The pair move toward their bedroom door speaking softly

GLEN
Do you think he heard us

HOLLY
Of course he heard What do you
think scared him He was--

The clicking shut of the bedroom door cuts her off

INT ERICS BEDROOM

Eric lies on his side back to the door eyes wide He hears
something He cant look Then he jumps arms flailing a
scream on its way--cut off by a hand clamping over his mouth
He trains the flashlight on his ankle--

--a hand is wrapped around it the beam runs past the wrist up
the arm to Brians face grinning out of the darkness His
attitude is that of a friendly co-conspirator a helpful ally in
the kids vs parents cold war

BRIAN
They were lying

Eric stares at him his mouth still covered

BRIAN
There is a monster

Eric shakes his head no emphatically

BRIAN
It went for your ankle right It
got mine Where do you think I
got this

Brian takes his hands away Sticks out one leg pulls up his
pajamas cuff revealing the old ugly scar on his ankle Eric
stares at it a little panicked

ERIC
You got that when your foot got
caught in the spokes When you
were little

Brian looks at him and smiles pityingly

BRIAN
Thats what
(jerks his head towards
their parents room)
they want you to think

Eric eyes widening turns to look in the direction Brian jerked
his head Brians smile gets bigger as he backs toward the
door

BRIAN
Theyre supposed to be comforting--
theyre parents Im your
brother
(reaches for the knob)
Here--Ill close thisyou really
ought to keep the lights down

ERIC
(a whisper)
Why
BRIAN
(matter-of-fact)
Because monsters are just like
mothstheyre attracted to
light

Brian smiles helpfully and pulls the door shut

The flashlight beam cuts across the dark room Eric turns it up
to look into it his worried face now lit from below He
glances quickly around the room All is silent Screwing up
his courage he snaps off the light and the room goes BLACK

Erics soft worried back-of-the-throat whimper floats out of
the darkness

INT ATTIC ROOM - MORNING - CLOSE ON

a gold pocketwatch The face is unique a disc with a wedge cut
out is set into a numbered ring The wedge turns revealing an
old-fashioned drawing of a benign sun for daylight hours a
malevolent man-in-the-moon in a starry sky for the nighttime

Brian sits at a worktable covered with disassembled mechanical
items He pores over the dismantled watch cleaning the pieces
with Dust-off

HOLLY (0OS)

Brian reluctantly sets the watch onto its stand

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Holly fits one last dish into the dishwasher Glen finishes his
coffee and grapefruit

Eric head down intently eats his cereal Brian breezes into
the room--then slows sensing tension Brian eases down next to
Eric

GLEN
I hope whatever you watched last

night was worth your allowance

BRIAN

Holly turns on the dishwasher

HOLLY
We found the sandwich

BRIAN
(beat)
What sandwich

Eric winces--he knows the shit has just hit the fan

HOLLY
Brian you are the only person in
this house who eats bologna and
onions Every time you get
caught you think you can lie your
way out of it

GLEN
You want to end up a politician

BRIAN
»Nno

Water pipes visible through a hole above the sink start to
knock Holly expecting this turns on and off the hot water
The knocking subsides

ERIC
Gotta catch the bus

HOLLY
This conversation is not over

ERIC
Its not fair you get mad at me
every time you get mad at Brian

The pipes start knocking again Holly takes a deep breath
gestures that Eric can go He grabs his lunch bag and leaves

Holly repeats the hot water ploy it doesnt work She tries it
once more again nothing She shuts down the dishwasher the
knocking stops for good

HOLLY
Damn Damn damn
Glen goes to her Brian is torn between escape--and his lunch
He edges toward it Glen puts an arm around Hollys shoulder
tries to cheer her

GLEN
The plumberll be out next week

HOLLY
Great Can I leave him the
dishes

GLEN

Just keep saying to yourself
Its our dream house

HOLLY
I never dreamed of seventeen
hundred dollars in plumbing
problems

Glen leans against the cupboard a strange look crosses his
face He turns melted strawberry ice cream stains his shirt
and drips out of the cupboard He pulls open the door--a soupy
half gallon of Carnation sits on a stack of dishes

Brian looks incredulously at the gooey mess snags his lunch
and beelines for the door--

GLEN
Youre a deadman

BRIAN
I didnt do it

HOLLY
Just like the sandwich

Glen disgusted plucks the carton out of the cupboard

BRIAN
Okay it was my sandwich-- but
I didnt have any ice cream You
always blame me for everything--

HOLLY
Somebody puts scuff marks on the
doors kicking them open And
somebody sticks gum under the
table--

BRIAN
Not me

Glen throws an ice cream-bloated sponge into the sink
GLEN
Well let this go as an accident
But Im laying down the law No
more intentionally disobeying the
rules You know the difference
between right and wrong Start
acting like it

BRIAN
(downcast)
yes sir

INT STAIRWELL

Brian sits on the stairs bookpack between his knees Glen tie
over his shoulder buttoning a fresh shirt hurries past He
kisses Holly goodbye and goes out the front door

Holly turns regards her glum son Sits down beside him

HOLLY
Brian your Dad and I are worried
You and Eric have been at the new
school the same amount of time
Erics already made some friends--

BRIAN
Grandpa was my friend

HOLLY

Yes I know I know you miss
Grandpa We all do

(beat)
But you should get out more Find
somebody to play with

(remembering)
The lawyer who handled the estate--
Mr Coleman He had a son about
your age

BRIAN
(stating a fact)
Ronnie Coleman is a toad

HOLLY
He seemed like a nice kid

BRIAN
We can have him over for milk and
dead flies
Holly reacts with a small smile despite herself--then they hear
a LONG SCRAPING CRUMPLING METAL SOUND from outside

EXT STEVENSON HOME - DRIVEWAY

Glen sternly guides Brian out through the garage Holly follows
as far as the garage door

GLEN

begins to move--but then it slows to a stop for a late-arrival
Brian He swings into his seat as the bus lurches forward

ERIC
Why arent you riding your bike

BRIAN
Dad ran over my bike because you
put it in the driveway

ERIC
No way Your bike

The bus slows for its next stop

serious)

Brian and Eric look at Todd who nods his head all-knowing

ERIC

Brian sighs rubs his eyes in a long-suffering gesture

BRIAN

RONNIE COLEMAN a sixth grade version of Pete Rose comes up the
aisle carrying Erics battered lunch Bag Ronnie wears a
football jersey with COLEMAN on the back A batting glove hangs
out of the back pocket of his jeans

RONNIE
Whos the Eric that threw his
lunch at me

Todds horror-stricken look throws a spotlight on Eric Ronnie
grape juice staining his jersey zeros in on him

ERIC

Eric points at Brians back

ERIC
My brother

RONNIE

RONNIE
(pointedly)
You got enough problems
A few laughs at this Eric throws in an oooooh burned Eric
cautiously takes the lunch Ronnie grins victoriously at Brian
who fumes Ronnie raises an eyebrow daring Brian to make

something of it

Brian holds his temper slumps down into his seat Ronnie
shakes his head in disgust swaggers down the aisle

A KID grins at Brian from the seat in front of him

You could take a bunch of pictures

and make it like a movie

CLOSE ON the flip-book of photos Brian riffles through it
The plant blooms

disappointed look Eric has an inspiration He hurries back up

laundry basket Eric holds his own covers in his arms

ERIC
You have to stay the whole night
And you gotta sleep with your leg
sticking out of the covers And
with the door closed

significantly Brian grimaces shakes his head

BRIAN

GLEN
Well if you run across them put
them back where they belong

Eric nods and takes off Brian turns back to the watch Glen
steps forward watches over Brians shoulder

CLOSE ON THE WATCH as Brian using a jewelers screwdriver
tightens a mechanism He releases a tiny lever Minute gears

spin ticking can be heard distinct from the soft whirring

GLEN
You got it running

Brian grins as Glen picks up the watch examines it

GLEN
Grandpad be happy You have his
mechanical touch It must skip a
generation

Brians smile turns a little sad Glen hands the watch back
Brian places it on the table in the watch stand

but pleased Todds shoes thunder on the stairs

Eric surveys the disassembled stuff on Brians worktable He
reaches for an electric train--

Brian steps forward takes the train sets it back down

BRIAN

walk from the bed to the door and

manage)

Slowly smoothly as if with a mind of its own the foot slips
back into the safety of the covers

INT ERICS BEDROOM - LATER

The waxing moon shines brightly Brian comes awake with a
start He tilts his head listening--muffled indistinct sounds
of laughter can be heard fading quickly to silence

Puzzled frowning Brian starts to swing a leg out of bed He
stops--thinks--then pushes the covers away from him until they
touch the floor covering the space beneath the bed

A long step and Brian is safely in the middle of the room He
goes to the door keeping an eye on the bed unable to see
beneath it--the covers block his view

Brian sidles out of the door listens--he hears a muffled voice
and moves silently toward it to the vent in the wall by the
attic stairs The voice becomes clearer as he nears

go by then ten

(Brian reaches the vent)
So the girls waiting for her
roommate to get back and shes
getting real scared

The vent is flush to the floor Todd is in his mummy bag only
his face visible sitting across from Eric The Tensor lamp is
the campfire between the two the gooseneck bent down so that
the lip of the shade nearly touches the floor

(low and scary-like)
--oh yeah the rooms on the
second floor--so shes waiting
and suddenly from outside she
hears thump-THUMPthump-THUMP
So she gets real brave and she
sneaks over to the door and she
hears it again thump-
THUMPthump-THUMP

INT HALLWAY

Brian raises one eyebrow listening

INT ATTIC ROOM

And so she opens the door and she
screams cause she sees her
roommate coming up the stairs--
only the ax-man cut off all her
arms and legs and shes draggin
herself up by her chin thump-

Todd in his mummy bag writhes on the floor impressively
depicting the predicament of the limbless roommate

ERIC

---WOW

Brian thinks He hits the riser in front of him with the palm
of his hand thump-THUMPthump- THUMP All sound from
upstairs ceases Brian grins darkly
INT ERICS BEDROOM

Brian comes through the door--and stops dead in his tracks
The bedcovers have been thrown all the way back away from the
floor onto the mattress--they lie in a long pile against the
wall Brian stares

The black inkiness of the under-the-bed gapes at him

Brian lowers himself into a half-stoop half-crouch peering
into the darkness Is there something there

Brian throws a look at the desk--the stand is empty his
pocketwatch is gone Brians eyes go wide He looks-- and sees
it under the bed just on the edge of the shadow

Brian reaches his hand up along the door frame to the light
switch He flips the switch--

and A MONSTROUS HORRIFIC CHILLING HOWL comes from right behind
him Brian spins in the still-dark room A blue glow flickers
behind the door

INT ATTIC ROOM
Todd jumps back from the stairs bumping into Eric

ERIC
(stepping back)
(panicked a hiss)
What was that

TODD
(another step back)
I dunno
(futilely optimistic
that Eric will do it)
Go find out

Eric considers this
ERIC

No

INT ERICS BEDROOM
Brian forces himself toward the blue glow and noise He reaches
for the knob yanks the door back stares into--

--the familys 25 diagonal television set sitting on its side
plugged into the switched socket tuned to an SCTV rerun
featuring Count Floyd

Brian snaps off the light switch (shutting off the set) and
whirls ducking to look under-the-bed

The watch chain becomes taut--the watch is pulled smoothly out
of view into the deep shadows under the bed

CLOSE ON Brian a cold sweat on his forehead all doubt drained
from his face Eric was right

INT HALLWAY

Brian darts his head out a light shines from beneath his
parents door Brians eyes go wide with anticipatory dread--
and then the light goes out Brian slumps relieved then snaps
a look back over his shoulder into the room--

springs until the castors are against the ground

BRIAN
(singing softly)
Roadrunnerthe coyotes after
you

H Brians hand squeezes the brake handle He snaps a rubber
band around it and doubles it The handle stays squeezed
Brian pulls out the books The bed stays up

BRIAN

youre through

INT ERICS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Brian lies in bed in the dark room awake waiting The door
opens It is Holly Her work shirt is speckled with paint--so
is her hair and her hands

HOLLY
Brian Are you awake

BRIAN
Yeah

HOLLY
Eric asked me to give this to you

She holds out the flashlight Brian takes it from her

HOLLY
(slightly questioning)
He said that tonight he wanted
you to have it

Brian lets this go by Holly smiles goes to the door

BRIAN
Mom

She turns

BRIAN
(like hes saying
goodbye)
I love you

HOLLY
(puzzled but pleased)
I love you too

She pulls the door shut Her footfalls recede the hall light
goes out There is the sound of a door closing

PREPARING THE BEDROOM - SERIES OF SHOTS

A The bedcovers are thrown back in a dramatic swoop by Brian
Revealed beneath is his Monster-Hunting Gear a pocketknife the
alarm clock a spool of 150 lb test fishing line a hockey stick
and a big bag of Doritos (Nacho Cheese)

B Brian strains to be quiet as he slides the dresser across
the floor in front of the walk-in-closet door

C Brian crisscrosses the fishing line around the room He
ties one end to the hammer-guard of the alarm clock

D At the door he disassembles and removes the inside knob
leaving the hall-facing knob and bolt in place

E He wedges a two-by-four against a piece of plywood that
covers the heating vent

F Brian lays down the hockey stick knife and flashlight
beside him on the wall side He adjusts their positions He
makes a few practice grabs quick He is ready

INT THE BEDROOM - LATER

Moonlight filters through the window Brian waits munching
Doritos as quietly as possible He has an inspiration He
scatters Doritos around the perimeter of the bed

Experimentally he leans down and makes a little man with his
hand and walks it toward the chips His finger steps on a chip
results in a crunching sound Brian smiles

INT THE BEDROOM - MUCH LATER

Brian isnt going to make it The alarm clock ticks away
hypnotically Brian is right on the edge of sleep

Crunch Brian pulls the blankets tighter CRUNCH Crunch
Brians eyes open but he does not move

More crunches Brian turns his head s-l-o-w-l-y looking as far
out of the corners of his eyes as possible The crunching
pauses then turns into the unmistakable sound of chomping
Whatever is out there it sure likes Doritos (Nacho Cheese)

Brian stealthily reaches one hand down to his knife He
positions the handbrake waiting He doesnt breath

The alarm clock is triggered it RINGS Brian cuts the rubber
band The brake pads open The rope releases Sprockets spin
Springs snap The trap works the bed collapses slamming to
the floor Brian spins the flashlight in his hand and on--

The beam catches something rushing straight towards Brian
straight for the under-the-bed a brief impression of yellow
eyes--then it is gone back into the dark

Brian snaps the light across the room almost catching something
in the peripheral of the beam

The alarm ringing shrilly throughout begins to whir down
Brian makes long sweeping arcs with the flashlight
systematically covering the room Nothing

The alarm is spent Silence

Brian peers into the dark A shape rises up behind him Brian
becomes aware of it just as an arm slaps across his chest--
Brian shouts and an instinctive jerk becomes a passable judo
throw propelling the shape over his shoulder to the floor

Snapping the flashlight around in a two-handed pistol-grip
Brian pins the shape in the beam--

And the room light goes on Brian looks over Glen is standing
in the doorway

BRIAN
Dad The monst--

The word stops as Brian looks back at what is in his beam an

innocuous pile of clothes T-shirts jeans and sweaters all

slightly yellowish in tint--and one ratty red bathrobeand a
Washington Senators baseball cap

Brians eyes go wide

BRIAN
—-er

CLOSE ON Glen as his eyes track from one corner of the room to
another his expression going from tired annoyance to shock to
disbelief to wide-awake anger He focuses on

Brian on the collapsed bed flashlight out in front of him one
foot on the floor Brian shifts his weight slightly a chip
crunches

GLEN
Christ Brian--I was counting on
you
(beat)
I give up

Brian intimidated by Glens forcefulness starts to feel bad
but then remembers

BRIAN
Wait a minute Ithere is--

GLEN
A monster Its a pile of
clothes for Chrissakes

He kicks the clothes Unseen by Glen two folds in the clothes
open like eyelids and stare up hatefully Brians eyes widen

GLEN
The next time you leave your room
will be the first time you vote

Brian is speechless He rubs his eyes looks at the clothes
They look normal

BRIAN
But--

Glen snaps off the light and reaches for the door knob it comes
off in his hand He gives Brian one more glare then pulls the
door shut

Brian swallows keeps the light unsteadily on the clothes He
stretches for the hockey stick Cautiously he jabs the stick
into the clothes barely Nothing happens

He gives the clothes a good poke That does it The sleeve
snaps the hockey stick out of his hands across the room

Brian half-leaps half-sprawls back he loses the flashlight
The clothes gather in on themselves start to change--

Brian slams the laundry basket over the clothes pile throws his
body on top of it The basket forces itself up off the floor
Brian is pitched hard heels-over-head to the ground

The basket continues to rise Brian gapes as the thing becomes
visible long flat feet with extraordinarily long toes A
yellowish hand curls out from under the lip of the basket and
throws it off
The Monster From Under the Bed glowers at Brian eyes aglow with
malevolent intelligence The ratty old red bathrobe still
exists the monster wears it with a certain panache He grins
face splitting in half revealing jagged rows of teeth His
name is MAURICE

MAURICE
Boo

Brian stifles a scream He grabs the rug and pulls hard The
monsters feet go out from under him he lands on his back

Brian scrambles away onto the bed pulls in his ankles as a
claw-like hand slashes down making four ragged tears in the
mattress Brian leaps over the monster runs for the door

The knob has been removed the door wont open Brian looks
despairingly at his own handiwork lunges for the window

Halfway across the room fishing line wraps around Brians
ankle the still-attached alarm clock acting as weight for the
makeshift bolo The monster grinning reels Brian in

Brian reaches desperately trying to extricate his leg Working
frantically inches out of reach Brian gets loose from the
line He rolls away grabbing up the hockey stick

The monster looks down at the clock dangling at the end of the
line The minute hand is nearly straight up Brian sees the
monster throw a look at the window Dawn washes the sky

The monster drops the clock and rushes for the bed Brian
thinking fast leaps between the monster and the bed
brandishing the stick The monster pulls up short The two
gauge each other For all its ugliness the monster is not much
taller than Brian It raises its claws

BRIAN
Ill scream

MAURICE
Thats good--lets both scream
Lets get your dad back in here

The monster takes a deep breath--then lets it out in a gasp as
Brian slugs him in the stomach

BRIAN
(a hiss)
Shaddup
The monster raises a hand takes some time to recover

MAURICE
(gasping)
Whoa time out

Brian pausesthen sees that the monster is furtively edging
toward the bed Brian glances out the window He sees the
lighting sky smiles He steps in front of the bed

BRIAN
Yeah Why dont we just wait

The monster recovers amazingly fast growls and feints ramming
Brian out of the way with a shoulder He makes it to the bed--
just as the sun edges over the horizon

The monster slips his fingers in under the bed frame and pulls
up His fingers pass through the box-spring and mattress--his
hands have become two-dimensional intangible

Brian jumps onto the mattress The monster panics Brian
levers the stick between the bed and the monster pries him
away The monster tries to move but his now-intangible feet
have no purchase He falls hands inches from the bed

A gradient effect beginning at the monsters fingertips turns
him from yellow to gray to black transforming him into his own
shadow Brian stares as the arms and legs flatten

BRIAN
Whats happening

MAURICE
What dyou think

BRIAN
Youre dying The sunlight--
youre a vampire

MAURICE
(gasping)
Puh-leez No such thingas
vampiresGotta get back under
the bed

BRIAN
No way You wrecked my bike You
stole my watch You been pulling
stuff trying to get me in
trouble

MAURICE
(hurt defensive)
Thats my job

Brian sucks on his lower lip thinking He looks toward the
window The sun has almost cleared the horizon

MAURICE
What you never did anything just
for a laugh

Maurices eyes wide and pleading lock with Brians The two
gaze at each other until finally the monsters eyelids drop
closed

BRIAN
Damn

Brian sighs at his victory turned hollow With both hands he
raises a corner of the bed watching the monster not at all
sure if it will do any good

Maurices eyes open slightly His gaze flickers to the bed he
tries to move but cant Straining to hold the bed up Brian
puts his arm around Maurices still-solid torso and pushes him
into the shadow

Brian lets the bed drop He collapses to the floor

Suddenly the bed lifts raising away from the floor like a
trapdoor Brian jumps back The monster fully recovered and
quite pleased holds the bed easily above his head with one arm
He looks like he is standing waist deep in an inky pool

His gaze flickers to the window--just as the sun clears the
horizon he grins a yellow grin at Brian

MAURICE
(confidentially)
Brian--
(beat)
Catch ya later

He disappears the bed dropping to the floor

INT STEVENSON HOME - HALLWAY - DAY
In the master bedroom Glen sits at a desk covered with bills
a printing calculator and the check book Holly holds an
invoice The tone of the argument is not harsh-- just hard

GLEN
Its certainly the liberal
solution to a problem Throw
money at it

HOLLY
Well since I seem to be
responsible for getting this place
fixed up--

GLEN
When we made the decision to live
here we knew it meant a lot of
work

HOLLY
For both of us

GLEN
Im commuting four hours a day
Do you think I enjoy that

HOLLY
You dont seem to enjoy much of
anything nowadays

GLEN
(moving to shut the
door)
Maybe theres not that much to
enjoy

Down the hall Brian steps out of Erics room with the laundry
basket Glen spots him

GLEN
Where do you think youre going

BRIAN
I finished cleaning I was going
back up to my room

GLEN
Well get there and stay there
Glen shuts the door A beat Brian turns to the stairs

INT ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Brian lies on his back wide awake staring up into the
darkness Suddenly another one of Erics screams pierces the
silence Brian starts then frowns a little scared A pause

MAURICE (0OS)
(from under the bed)
Brianhey Brian

Brians eyes go a little wider He doesnt move

MAURICE (0OS)

Yo Brian Im back Whyd you

whiffleball You know he sucks

(beat)
Cmon I know youre up there I
can hear you holding your breath

Brian begins breathing again

MAURICE (0OS)
Okay fine Here--I brought you
something

A thing lands on Brians chest He squirms out from under it

MAURICE (0OS)
Catch ya later

A clatter from below and then silence Brian gingerly picks up
Maurices gift holds it up into a spill of moonlight his
grandfathers pocketwatch Surprised he looks down over the
side of the bed Nothing

EXT SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - KICKBALL DIAMOND - DAY

A kickball game in progress Ronnie is on second base Brian is
the catcher

A lanky red-headed girl kicks a grounder Ronnie rounds third
and heads for home Brian in the baseline waits for the
throw Ronnie accelerates lowers his shoulder and slams into
Brian sending him sprawling in the dirt
Ronnie stands up grins at Brian turns toward his dugout

The throw from first rolls in Brian picks it up With deadly
aim he hurls the ball as hard as he can nailing Ronnie in the
back of the head Ronnie stumbles recovers spins

BRIAN
You didnt hit the plate Youre
outta-—

Ronnie has already launched himself at Brian and the two go
down into the dust amid shouts of Fight Fight

EXT STEVENSON HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Brian gets out of the car walks toward the house the condemned
man escorted to the chair--by Glen and Holly

GLEN
I want to know why you threw the
ball at him in the first place

BRIAN
To get him out

HOLLY
No mouth Brian The principal
said the game was over and then
you threw it

GLEN

Christ A new school and more
fighting Do you have any idea
how disappointed we are in you

(he opens the front

door)
Youre never going to get out of
your room

A look of pure anger crosses Brians face as he goes inside

INT ATTIC ROOM - DAY

Brian trudges up the stairs to his desk He digs into his
pocket pulls out the pocketwatch flips it open--

--pieces of shattered crystal rain down Brian is shocked the
crystal is gone the casing dentedthe hands still The
benign Sun is frozen peeking out of the wedge

Brian grips the watch fists going white-knuckled--he spins to
throw it against the wall stops A deep breath He sits down
starts to take the watch apart blinking back tears

INT ATTIC ROOM - LATER

Brian is asleep his head on the desk Just the desk lamp is
on Suddenly the bulb SHATTERS throwing the room into
darkness snapping Brian awake He whirls--

Maurice stands silhouetted in moonlight twirling a slingshot by
the elastic He hitches his Senators cap back on his head

MAURICE
The names Maurice but back home
they call me Dead-eye

Brian scrabbles for the light switch he has rigged to a bunch of
extension cords--he flips it--

LIGHT FLOODS THE ROOM two shadeless floor lamps super-8 movie
lamp mechanics light the overhead light extension cords
criss-cross the floor a string of miniature Christmas lights
circle the room blinking casting colored shadows

Maurice disappears The slingshot clatters onto the floor
beside the same pile of clothes from before

BRIAN
Its like when your eyeballs get
bigger when it gets darker If
the lights go on you turn into
clothes Right

MAURICE
(like his mouth is
filled with cotton)
Oh cmon--we did the man-versus-
monster thing to death all ready

BRIAN
Go away Dont bother me anymore
or Eric I got enough problems
without you sneaking around
(beat it registers)

MAURICE

Brian considers He flips the switch the lights go off
Maurice re-forms into his bipedal self He pockets his
slingshot spies the watch

Brian frowns then leans toward Maurice

MAURICE

Whoa there Thunder--no lights

The forbidden

Brian flicks on the light angles it toward him menacingly

MAURICE
Hey Bring that along why

BRIAN

MAURICE

Brian hesitates then grins tightly every late-night Charles
Bronson film of the last five years replaying in his mind

BRIAN
Lets nail that toad to the wall

MAURICE
Yknowyoure my kinda guy

Maurice lifts the bed

MAURICE
After you

Brian kneels Looks at Maurice dubious He extends his hand
into the darkness It does not go through the solid floor

MAURICE
Oh yeah thats right We gotta
go together Dull people cant do
it

Using one hand to support the bed Maurice grabs Brians arm
helps him in Brian tentative expecting to contact floor is
startled to find none He loses his balance plunges straight
through the shadow from below comes a THUD

MAURICE
(calling to Brian)
Good
(a sinister smile)
Real good

He disappears into the shadow The bed THWOMPS to the floor

INT UNDER-THE-BED - ATTIC STAIRS

Brian picks himself up off the ground He is next to a closed
door at the bottom of a narrow steep staircase that leads up
to the rectangle shadow of the bed Maurice skitters down the
staircase to him
Brian panics searches the floor beside him

MAURICE
Lose something

Maurice dangles the flashlight from one finger Brian grabs it
Maurice pulls open the door steps out into

INT UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY

Brian peers down the hall--the ends if any are lost in the

distance Doors are scattered along the walls some reach high
with low-set knobs others are short there are Dutch doors and
French doors and doors that hang crooked but still shut tight

The walls loom seemingly on the verge of collapsing in on
themselves The dark mahogany wainscotting and dark red
wallpaper swallow the light from the tiny flickering gas lamps
near the ceiling

Brian steps into this His jaw is slack A frayed red runner
cuts a swath down the polished black floor

Maurice is already moving down the stairway He realizes Brian
isnt with him stops

MAURICE
Yo Brian Lets move em out
Were burning nightlight pard

Brian starts slowly then hurries to catch up to Maurice

INT UNDER-THE-BED - STATRWELL

Brian gasps The hallway has ended they are at the bottom of
a huge well Archways lead to other hallways above there are
tiers of landings running around the circumference and more
hallways Further up the landings droop and twist whole
sections torn away until there is just black

In the center of the well is a massive staircase spiralling up
offshoots connecting the landings It continues far up finally
standing alone dilapidated too impossibly high to support its
own weight--but it does And there at a dizzying height it
ends at a small landing at a pair of tall doors seemingly
suspended in the darkness
Brian grabs Maurices robe

BRIAN
(a croak)
Where are we

MAURICE
Hm Ohwe go one flight up and
its the third door on the left

He heads up the stairs Brian hangs onto the robe eyes wide
letting Maurice lead him on

INT STAIRWELL - RONNIES STAIRS

A wrought-iron circular stairway disappears into the bed-shaped
black area

MAURICE
Here we are

BRIAN
But--but Ronnie lives clear over
by Lake Skopski How

MAURICE
(a little smug)
Magic

Maurice climbs the stairs into the shadow disappearing from the
shoulders up Brian follows bumps his head unable to go
through Maurice reaches down and pulls him up by the collar

INT RONNIES ROOM - NIGHT

Maurice and Brian look for all the world like two decapitated
heads sitting on the floor under a bed They whisper

BRIAN

Movement from above startles Brian an ankle flops down hangs
in front of his face A beat and he reaches for it--but

coughs)

cigarettes in his bookbag

BRIAN

Maurice shoves his cap back cocks an eyebrowthen grins

INT RONNIES ROOM - LATER
Ronnie snurfles awake Groggily he stretches and sits up--

--and the sheet yanks tight slamming Ronnie back onto the
mattress pinning his arms He struggles mightily trying to
get up--the sheet snaps taut and he is pinned again

Maurice and Brian grin like madmen at each other across the
bedshadow as they strain to keep Ronnie pinned

RONNIE
Mom Dad Help

Brian almost lets go of his side--but Maurice puts a hand out in
a not yet gesture

MAURICE
(his most horrible
voice)
Screaming will only make it
worse

Ronnie squirms half-heartedly The fear is numbing

RONNIE
I gotta get up

Maurice nudges Brian indicating its his turn Brian shakes
his head no Maurice eggs him on

BRIAN
(screechy old-type
voice)
If he gets up I get his toes
You can eat the rest

Maurice looks at Brian Thats disgusting Brian shrugs it
was just a first attempt

Above Ronnie gives up the struggle he grimaces in humiliation
A tear squeezes out of one eye rolls down his cheek--

--the door opens the light goes on Ronnies dad a solid man
with an iron-grey brush cut steps into the empty room

MR COLEMAN

Off screen a door slams with a BANG

INT UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY - NEAR THE ATTIC STAIRS

A door swings all the way open flat against the wall Maurice
comes through holding a TV remote-control The door swings
back-- revealing an entry way that wasnt there previously
Brian comes through with an arm load of socks

Maurice tosses the remote-control onto a heaping pile of remote-
controls He pulls another from a pocket tosses it pulls
another tosses etc about a dozen in all Over this

MAURICE
Did you get ‘em

BRIAN
Yeah

MAURICE
They dont match

BRIAN
Of course not
(rubs the mismatched
socks on his cheek
Still dryer-soft too

To one side is a pulley-system clothesline with socks hanging
from it Brian pins a sock pulls the line pins another the
sock line goes off into infinityand comes back from same

Two monsters pass by each lugging one end of a grandfather
clock Maurice grabs Brian by the shirt and hauls him away
scattering the arm load of socks

MAURICE
A ballgame Cmon

INT UNDER-THE-BED - MAIN CHAMBER

As Maurice hauls Brian past the clock-carrying monsters (who
wrestle it up upright) There is the unmistakable CRACK of a
bat Brian dives away from Maurice--

--as a baseball smashes into the grandfather clock starts it
BONGING

MAURICE
Yo Brian Little help

Brian stares at the ball in front of his face He picks up the
ball rises and sees

ANOTHER ANGLE - MAIN STATRWELL

currently in-use as the playing field for a game of indoor
Monster Baseball There are monster fielders Mary Jane
crouches on an endtable punches her glove chatters (Cmon
batter cmon batter SWING) a fat one is in right PORSCHE
sunglasses on a boom-box blaring rave-up rocknroll

All over the playing field are various breakable objects--
lamps vases aquariums television sets Baccarat crystal
objects dart etc Home plate is a china serving dish

Maurice swings two bats--smashing a lamp behind him in the
process He tosses one bat away--another crash off screen

Striding toward Brian is SPIKE a stocky monster in a black
chest protector and protective mask He flips the mask up

SPIKE
Give me that and git No
spectators on the field

Spike jerks his thumb toward the stairs where a raucous group
of fans throw beer cans and popcorn boxes at him

SPIKE
All right Imaginary runners on
second and third Still two out
no score top of the third

Brian watches the game as he wanders around past the fans

Spike passes the mound tosses the ball to the pitcher a
monster wearing OVERALLS who winds up Spike still on his way
to the plate drops to the ground--the ball whizzes past where
his head was Maurice line-drives it into a stack stereo
system toppling it From his prone position

SPIKE
Thats a triple Two runs score

The BLEACHER BUMS think its a homer and let him know Maurice
taps his bat lightly on home plate shattering it Spike steps
up brushes the fragments away with a whisk broom puts down
another plate

Out on the field two groundskeeper monsters hurriedly drag away
the stereo replacing it with a place glass window

Brian smiles but shakes his head not that interested He

looks up the stairs up to the door far above He puts a hand
on the bannister

INT UNDER-THE-BED - MAIN STAIRWAY

High above the baseball game Brian looks down then up at the
door keeps climbing

A line drive rips toward Maurice He raises a sterling silver
tray into its path The ball PWHANGS into the tray denting it
the ball drops Maurice catches it with his cap

MAURICE

He bows with a flourish Turns proudly toward the stands
searches but cant find Brian

SPIKE (0OS)
Okay batter up Cmon we gotta

get this stuff upside in an hour

Maurice finally spots Brians figure climbing up near the
ruined section of landings

MAURICE
Oh shit

He dashes for the stairs ignoring the protests behind him
INT UNDER-THE-BED - MAIN STAIRCASE - LANDING

Brian picks his way up the ruined steps The shadows here are
deeper more enveloping He pulls the flashlight out of his
back pocket turns it on He puts a foot on the next step--

A huge yellowish arm muscles bunching on top of muscles snaps
down over his shoulder tears the flashlight out of Brians
hand The light clicks off

From the shadows comes a voice like razor-sharp icicles

VOICE
Bye-bye Sunshine

A shape looms a huge hand grabs Brian by the head and lifts
him out over the banister the endless drop below him

Brian grabs the thick wrist with both hands His feet scramble
for purchase but find none

MAURICE (0OS)
Hes with me Snik

And Maurice is there defiant and wary SNIK one menacing
yellow eye much larger than the other light glinting crazily
off them both glares down at the smaller monster

Snik holds Brian without strain--or a whole lot of concern for
Brians life He has the teeth of a shark he is hunched over
from the weight of his muscled back and shoulders

MAURICE
Hes the new guy

Snik looks at Brian His brow furrows He looks at Maurice

SNIK
(indicates the stairs)
Rules broken
(indicates Brian)
Neck broken

Maurice hops onto the banister keeps his voice low so Brian
(trying to swing a leg over Sniks arm) wont hear

MAURICE
Headless people have limited
potential Snik Hes with me
(Snik no comprende)

The boss okayed it Remember

Bri-an Ste-ven-son

Sniks eyes widen a little his gaze flickers towards the upper
doors Understanding floods his face

SNIK
Ahthis is the one

Maurice gives Snik a dirty look snaps a finger to his lips
Snik lifts Brian back over the banister--but doesnt set him
down Sniks thumb and forefinger cover Brians ears

SNIK
Too much for you Maurice Need
some help I think

MAURICE
No Snik Ill take care of him

SNIK
Youd better

Snik drops Brian to the floor Maurice helps him to his feet
then practically pushes him down the stairs Snik clears his
throat for attention Maurice and Brian give it to him

Snik holds up the flashlight He unscrews the end drops the
batteries into his hand He grins not straining as he crushes
the batteries the acid dripping down his arm He throws the
flashlight and endcap at Brian who picks them up

SNIK
Dont bring it again Brian
(displays the batteries)
Or head be next--Brian

Maurice shoves Brian around downstairs watching Snik Snik is
pleased with himself

BRIAN

MAURICE
You dont want to be what Go

You didnt want me to be your
friend You just wanted me to
turn into a monster

MAURICE
(not liking the
accusation cause its
pretty accurate)
Cant make somebody do something

Maurice grabs Brian by the arm Brian pulls away He grabs the
light switch Maurice leaps for his arm--Brian snaps on the
lights and Maurice transforms into clothes

Brian catches his breath He reaches into the clothes ignoring
the slapping sleeves Brians hand emerges from the pocket of
the robe with Maurices matches The sleeves freeze drop

Brian tears a match from the packet He holds it to the
striking surface

BRIAN
Leave me alone Dont come bac
here Do you understand
(no answer)
Do you understand

Silence Brian strikes the match The clothes shrink back
BRIAN
Dont make me do this Just
promise to leave me alone

MAURICE
(a long pause) (muffled)

BRIAN

He shuts off the lights The match illumines his face Maurice
re-forms and moves toward Brian

MAURICE
(with a sneer)

You trusted me

BRIAN
Yes

Maurice about to mock him pulls up short
MAURICE
(shakes his head sadly)
Its not that easy
Ducking his head he dives past Brian into the under-the-bed
The match burns down Brian drops it the room goes black

thinking She stands up suddenly heads out of the room

Todd takes the bookpack warily He looks inside He near-
reverently takes out a pair of old sneakers

attaches the wires to the battery tightens the wing-nuts He
screws the 5600-K bulb in He flips it on

Brian pins the transformed monster in the beam of the second
flashlight sets it on the floor The monster is pinned

Todd stares at the clothes He reaches up to turn on his
helmet It doesnt go on A tad panicked he slaps the side of
the helmet The bubble light and the miners lamp go on--

--and Brian is caught in the beam Something catches Kierstens
eye--she leans closer to Brian staring at his arm The skin
looks like cloth She shines her own flashlight on it--the
transformation quickens Brian yanks his arm out of the lights
Kiersten fixes him with a stare

KIERSTEN
Youre one of them

He steps toward her She gestures threateningly with her
flashlight Todd is still staring frozen in place

He points toward a hallway starts for it--

--and Billy rounds a corner pushing a wheelbarrow full of
buttons He stops when he sees them they stare back Billy
spins lets go of the wheelbarrow--buttons scatter-- he runs--

--and suddenly a beam of light cuts across the hall The Billy-
clothes continue their momentum sailing through the air
landing rolling into a ball in the corner

pins it with another

INT UNDER-THE-BED - LOWER LANDING

Our heroes race through an archway and come to a dead halt--
They are at the main stairwell higher up near a dilapidated

section of the stairs on a balcony--which is a dead-end the

The threesome exchange glances--then turn this is where they
will make their stand They snap out flashlights From down
the hall come the sounds of their pursuers

BRIAN

Brian surprised gives her a sideways look smiles--

He snaps on his light--Brian grabs his wrist knocking the
flashlight down

It is Maurice

Brian appraises him surprised suspicious

MAURICE
Cmon No time
TODD

Maurices face relaxes--the boy he once was can almost be seen
Out of the dark comes the sound of approaching monsters

MAURICE
So hide already

The three duck into an alcove

MAURICE
HEY DOWN HERE HERE THEY ARE

In front of the tall doors are two SENTINEL MONSTERS
Todd and Kiersten lean close Brian rubs his jaw Todds

helmet bumps against Kierstens head She gives it a look--then
looks at it again Smiles

INT UNDER-THE-BED - UPPERMOST LANDING

The sentinel monsters bored at their posts Unseen by them a
hand sets Todds helmet on the floor Gives it a push It
slides across the landing to in front of the monsters The
monsters look at it Exchange a puzzled glance One takes a
tentative step closer to the helmet--
--one of Todds sneakers thrown hard hits the side of the
helmet The revolving light goes on the monsters are caught
changing back and forth between monster and clothes

The trio spring onto the landing Todd and Kiersten go about
pinning the monsters Brian steps past them eyes fixed on the
doors Immensely tall and impossibly narrow polished black
wood covered with intricate runes Nightmare doors

Brian readies the Sun-Gun Kiersten and Todd look on as Brian
forces himself to touch the knob He turns it He pushes

INT UNDER-THE-BED - MASTER BEDROOM

The doors part Brian peers through He steps in Todd and
Kiersten close behind they gape at the room--

Toys of all eras fill the room on tall standing shelves Train
tracks and race-car tracks criss-cross the floor All is
covered with dust and cobwebs--an attic filled with forgotten
worn-out treasures now rotting and hiding rats

Hanging from the ceiling are model airplanes of all sizes and
types

At the far end of the room is a fireplace a chair to one side
A silhouetted figure rises from the chair

BRIAN
(over his shoulder)
Watch the stairs

Brian steps forward peering through shadow-mottled room at the
shape He brings the light up thumb on the ON switch

Backlit by the flames the figure seems bent over with age a
twisted shape Then it steps into the light--it is a young boy
Brians age possibly younger A boy who has stopped
growingbut hasnt stopped aging

In one hand he holds a marionette its strings hopelessly
tangled He wears a Victorian nightshirt and velvet dressing
gown When he speaks it is the voice of a boy-- but with the
rhythms and control of an adult He gazes directly at Brian

BOY

Brian Such a pleasure to meet
you

BRIAN
I want my brother

BOY
And you brought friends How
nice

Brian brandishes the Sun-Gun no fooling around

BRIAN
I want Eric

A heavy arm shoves Brian to the ground--Brian hits hard bounces
up snapping on the Sun-Gun--

--Sniks foot slams down on the cord it is torn away from the
battery in a shower of sparks Snik reaches menacingly for
Brian but a sharp gesture and a dark look from the boy cows
him Kiersten has been searching her pack she is out of
flashlights She looks resignedly at Brian

BOY
Now Brian--what sort of greeting
is that After all we are so
much alike

BRIAN
No were not

BOY
Yes we are Brian Youre like
all of us down here Youre
already one of us-- under the
skin

He nonchalantly tries to untangle the marionettes strings

BOY
When Maurice told me how you
scared Eric--Monsters are like
moths Sheer genius You belong
here You know you do

BRIAN
I do not

The boys efforts at the strings get more frantic less
effective

BOY
Stay here with us Brian You
have friends here

BRIAN
Maurice only pretended to be my
friend-- to lure me down here--
(beat grim)
Wheres my brother

Suddenly the boy smashes the marionette onto a table top
Splintered pieces scatter The boy looks at the crushed puppet
briefly then drops it

BOY
Snik Show him Eric

Grinning Snik creaks open a toychest He pulls Eric up by the
hair He is a poor Jack-in-the-box one eye blackened mouth
bloody

TODD
Eric

Erics eyes track finally focus in on Todd Todd starts toward
him--but Snik pulls Eric out of the chest a huge forearm across
Erics throat Kiersten grabs Todds arm

SNIK
Cmon This puny neck-- break
easy
BOY
(to Brian)

If you stay youll be the one in
charge of yourself Youll be the
one with power Not your parents
Not your teachers You

(beat)
Isnt that what you want

Sounds from outside the doors Kiersten looks that way

KIERSTEN
Brian More monsters--

TODD
(looking out)
--lots more monsters

Brian looks at Todd Kiersten They watch him waiting for his
decision Brian focuses on the boy

BRIAN
I want Eric

Dramatically Brian pulls a flashlight out of his pocket
brandishes it--looks down at it
It is the penlight Snik looks at the puny light chuckles
Brian grits his teeth aims it at the boy flips it on--
--the boy flinches away blocking his face with his arms
Brian whirls closes on Snik aims the light at Sniks head

Sniks head--just his head--transforms into an army boot and a
pair of sweat socks His arm is still at Erics throat

Brian lowers the light--Snik bellows as his head re-forms and
his arm becomes a pant leg Eric struggles out of Sniks grip
Todd and Kiersten grab Eric and they scramble away

Snik grabs Brian with his untransformed arm Brian aims the
light below Sniks waist turning the monsters legs into a
shirt and jacket Snik bellows again as his still-formed torso
collapses on top of the clothes

Brian heads for his friends by the door

Snik recovers struggles to his feet ready to give chase The
boy lays a restraining hand on his arm

BOY
Dont worry Snik Theyve lost

EXT UNDER-THE-BED - UPPERMOST LANDING

Brian Kiersten Todd and Eric look down Monsters crowd up the
stairway

KIERSTEN

BRIAN
We can make it

Brian leads the others straight toward the oncoming monsters--
just before they meet he turns down a side landing

It dead-ends short of the uppermost level of the stairwell
Brian leaps across his friends follow Monsters scatter
taking alternate routes to get at them

Brian opens a door at random climbs a stairway to beneath a bed-
shadow He is all set to move smoothly through the shadow--but
slams full-tilt into it his head hitting hard
Brian holds his skull stares unbelievingly at the shadow

TODD
Whats wrong

BRIAN
I dont know

Brian tries to push his hand through it stops at the shadow
KIERSTEN
(an idea hits her)
Ohmigod--What time is it
Brian pulls out his pocketwatch The watch reads 523 the

benign sun-face peeks out through the wedge the malevolent man-
in-the moon almost gone

BRIAN
Weve still got almost half an
hour

KIERSTEN

(gestures to the watch)
Are you sure its right

Brian looks from the shadowway to the watch His face falls

BRIAN
I didnt fix it Its still
broken

TODD

You mean were trapped

A laugh sounds from below The four look down at the Boss who
grins triumphantly

BOY
Brian Im so glad you decided to
stay

Brian turns back to the shadow pushes--then slams his fists at
the shadow in frustration in anger

BOY (OS)
Truthfully Im surprised you even
came down Imagine a selfish
little bugger who cares for no one
trying to do a good deed--

(his taunts lash at

Brian)
Of course it did only serve to
deliver your friends unto me So
I guess that ultimately all this
misfortune is your fault But
then you already knew that
didnt you

Brian can take no more With a roar he rushes down the stairs
past the others at the boy--who steps back Brian sprawls

INT UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY

Snik comes at Brian Brian lashes out with his foot nailing
Snik in the shin Snik howls Brian kicks viciously at Sniks
other leg Snik howls again and Brian scrambles to his feet
He brings his leg up with all his might as hard as he can--

--and Snik catches it inches from his crotch He wags one
finger of his free hand at Brian Brian eyes widen in dread
Snik tumbles him backwards to the floor

Brian tries to struggle up--a huge fist smashes into the side of
his head stunning him

INT UNDER-THE-BED - STATRWELL

where the others watch the fight--Kiersten winces as another
haymaker pounds Brian--who stops moving Snik stands over him
bellows triumphantly The boy looks up at them

BOY
Allie-Allie-otsen-free
(beat harsher)
Were waiting

Kiersten Todd and Eric exchange glances all hope gone
Kiersten drops her head--then starts down Todd follows
INT UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY

Monsters grab Kiersten Todd and Eric Spike strips off Brians
pack--the movement causes Brian to revive He groans sitting
up

BOY
You see Brian You cannot
challenge my power down here If
I say you stay then you stay If
I say the shadows are closed then
the shadows are closed

MAURICE (0OS)
Aa put a sock in it

He steps out of the shadows Looks at Brian Tsks once at
his condition

MAURICE
Theres still time to get out

BOY
The shadow is closed

MAURICE
To Brian its closed He came
down here to rescue his brother
Not your typical monster behavior
is it

Kierstens eyes widen She struggles out of the grasp of the
monster holding her grabs up the penlight off the floor She
shines it--on Brians arm

Brian does not change A monster wrestles the light from
Kiersten Brian snaps his gaze to the Boss

BRIAN
You tricked me

BOY
All part of the game Brian Oh
dont look so surprised Only
monsters can move in shadows You
gave up any claim to that
privilege when you chose to rescue
your brother

This surprises some of the monsters
SPIKE
You told me once you start to

BOY
Did you really want to go back
Spike looks down maybe he did at one time but not any more

BOY
(to Maurice)
As for you--Ive put up with your
behavior long enough

MAURICE
Im just a natural-born rebel
Shoot me

The boy stares at him

BOY
Snik
(indicating Brian)
Break his neck

MAURICE
(steps toward Snik)
No

Snik drops Brian unceremoniously and gestures to Maurice

SNIK
More medicine eh Cure you--of
life
Maurice hesitates
BOY

Your move Maurice
Maurice looks at the towering Snik--then spins and runs

Brian from the floor stares after Maurice drops his head

INT UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY

Maurice a bat out of hell zooms toward a particular door--

INT UNDER-THE-BED - ALAINES STAIRWAY

--though the door up a flight of stairs--

INT ALAINES BEDROOM - MORNING
as Maurice zooms from under the bed waking Alaine who screams
he races across the room and jumps out the window crashing
through the screen to--

EXT ROOF

--where he leaps across to the next house--he dashes along the
eaves silhouetted against the pre-dawn sky he dives in through
a window--

INT DEFENSIVE NINE-YEAR-OLDS BEDROOM - MORNING

The kid comes awake as Maurice crashes in hits the floor ina
shower of glass rolls shoots down under the bed--

INT UNDER-THE-BED - STAIRWAY

--Maurice drops out of a shadowway dives down the stairs--—

INT UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY

--Maurice bursts out of the doorway directly behind Snik
catching him by surprise He slams him face forward into the
floor-- Maurice rolls clear--

Brian commando-rolls to his backpack grabbing it from Spike
and dives for the Sun-Gun on the floor--

--with his teeth he strips one of the wires--
--Maurice helps Kiersten Eric and Todd free themselves--
--Brian twists down the wing nuts on the battery--

BOY
Stop them

MAURICE
Dont listen to him Whats he
ever done for you
Monsters starting forward pause to think

--Brian brings the lamp up--

--the boys eyes widen--

--Maurices eyes widen--

--Brian thumbs the switch--

BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT cuts across the room slams into the Boss
slams him up into the lattice--he flattens into a silhouette--
the light slices through him--the lattice gives way--the Boss is
blasted up and away into oblivion

The bulb EXPLODES--

POV BRIAN--

--as his eyes re-adjust to the darkness revealing

The hallway Some of the monsters have been turned into
Hiroshima shadows on the walls Some are partial shadows Snik
is a mess part monster part clothes part wavering between
solid and shadow

Brian drops the lamp He looks around wildly

BRIAN
Maurice Maurice

A doorway opens Maurice peers out warily He surveys the room

MAURICE
(shaky)
Now thats what I call rock n
roll

Brian sighs Maurice steps out
MAURICE

Shouldnt you folks be toddling
along

INT UNDER-THE-BED - ATTIC STAIRS
Eric and Todd are on the stairs

TODD
Well we were right huh

Eric smiles slaps him five as Maurice followed by Brian
hurries past them to the top of the stairs

KIERSTEN
(as Maurice goes by)
You might not be able to get
through now--now that you helped
us--

BRIAN
Yeah--monsters dont help friends--

Maurice slides his hand through with no problem He looks at
it half-through and then looks down sadly at Brian

MAURICE
Face it Bri--some of us got it

He grabs Kierstens shoulder hustles her out--then Eric and
Todd Maurice looks at Brian who doesnt move

MAURICE
Get out of here you toothfairy

Brian gives him a long look climbs through the hole

INT STEVENSON HOME - ATTIC ROOM - MORNING

Brian slides out from under the bed He glances at the window--
the sun is up but it hasnt cleared the horizon yet He turns
and looks at Maurice still in the shadow

MAURICE
Well I promised you excitement

BRIAN
Those other monsters are going to
kill you

MAURICE

Brian spots the penlight in Kierstens hand He takes it He
cocks an eyebrow at Maurice Maurice arches both eyebrows a
smile spreading on his face Brian hands the penlight to him

BRIAN

MAURICE
(sagely)
In the land of the blind the one-
eyed man is king

He loses his wise composure and grins

BRIAN

MAURICE
Not if I catch you first

He slips back into the shadow and is gone Brian pulls out his

watch the sweep second hand ticks to the twelve-- Brian looks

up and the sun clears the horizon Brian puts his hand to the

shadow trying to reach through it trying to reach Maurice

is only a shadow

Brian turns away from the bed away from the others

Brian looks up at her

BRIAN
