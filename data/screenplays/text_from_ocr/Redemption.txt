never shoot at anything but a
cardboard target

DETECTIVE RISON So

INT ROOM -- DAY

Stewart looks across the table at TYLER BARRETT
Early thirties Hair short as a man’s sculpted
eyebrows a bare minimum of make-up An
attractiveness that sits in the grey area between
wholesome and severe

STEWART
Three years

TYLER
Uh huh

Stewart drums his fingers on the table

STEWART
I just thought Bern would find
me someone with a little more
experience I’m in some serious
trouble here

Stewart studies her

STEWART
How many murder cases have
you had

TYLER
Two

STEWART

How many did you win

other was murdered in jail
during the trial

STEWART
Does that count as a win or
a loss

She folds her hands says nothing
No of
murde
fine

fense This is first degree
r here I’m sure you’d do
on something else

TYLER

My specialty is jaywalking

TYLER

You know what Forget it

STEWART

Forget it Why

Well
meat

TYLER

You owned the murder

weapon you were at the scene

with

enough DNA evidence on you

to convict thirty men you had
motive and you have no alibi
And secondly if I had to defend

you

you Hours and hours And

after two minutes with you I
already have a rash on my neck

PROSECUTOR
e was found at the crime
covered in her blood

PROSECUTOR

We think he is a flight risk

and

request that he be held

Stewart stares after her

without bail until his trial
Tyler rises

TYLER
The reason Stewart Mailer was
found at the crime scene was
that he called the police
himself to report the murder o
his wife There is no proof
whatsoever that Stewart Mailer
pulled the trigger No powder
his hands No fingerprints on
the gun Mr Mailer has never
been in trouble with the law a
is not a flight risk There is
no reason to spend taxpayer’s
money keeping this man in jail

of the store when I was
digging around for the receipt

before in her life And my own
father-in-law won’t return my
calls

STEWART

Everyone loved her

TYLER
Maybe someone wanted to get
back at you Do you have any
enemies

STEWART

for his daughter A decent man

Tyler nods Waits in the silence

TYLER
Did you ever cheat on her

He gives her a look

TYLER
I have to ask

STEWA

RT (finally)
Once Before we were married I
was just scared of commitment

myself I thought one day I’m
gonna pay for that Maybe I’m
paying for it now

Tyler sets down her soup spoon rests her chin on
her hands

TYLER
You had a son who died

Stewart looks up

plate

STEWART
He wasn’t even a year old He

He’s choking up now Battling for composure

STEWART
He drowned in our pool okay
That’s what happened

EXT SIDEWALK - A LITTLE LATER

trying to get his balance

KEITH

Are you taking me shooting
STEWART

No
KEITH

My house was on the news last
night And my neighbors’
houses And yours

Keith takes a breath

KEITH “It’s a
quiet neighborhood near the
outskirts of this city an
American dream of safety and
even routine But one day in
early March this sleepy little
enclave became the scene of a
nightmare”

Keith puts his hands in the air and begins to turn
again slowly

KEITH
Turn with me

Stewart lines up next to Keith begins to turn

KEITH
Faster

They turn faster together
KEITH
Faster

They whirl around and around The trees are a blur So
are the flowering bushes that line the fence Stewart
and Keith fall down in the grass

KEITH
Look at the clouds

Stewart looks up White clouds spin crazily around
the sky Stewart blinks tries to focus

Waits until the clouds calm down into a leisurely
pace like the circling of buzzards

STEWART

Can I ask you a question
KEITH

Yes
STEWART

What do you remember about
the night Kathy was killed

Keith is silent for a moment

KEITH
The police came and their lights
were red and blue and their
license plate was 4CVU806 and they
pushed you in the back of their
car and you said Kathy Kathy Kathy
Kathy OH GOD Kathy--

Stewart holds up his hand shushing him

that Mercedes you saw parked in
the driveway four times

KEITH
Dark windows License

memory Sometimes it takes a
long time

STEWART
How long

on toward the church

Stewart picks himself up His shirt is dirty He turns
slowly back to his car is walking toward it when he
sees Wellington’s BLACK MERCEDES pull up and park
Wellington exits in a charcoal suit

Stewart’s body language indicates an internal battle
Get in the car Or kill him

Wellington spies Stewart They stare at each other a
long minute

Stewart takes his sunglasses off so Wellington can see
his red eyes clearly So there can be no mistake just
how much he hates him

EXT STEWART’S OLD HOUSES - NIGHT

over every space

He pulls out drawers in the master bedroom spilling
there contents

Finally he enters the master bathroom
Trains his flashlight around the little room hunting

bottom of the tub

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Stewart and Kathy lounge naked in the water Jacob
sits between them looking from one to the other

KATHY

He strokes Jacob’s wet tuft of hair

STEWART
You know he looks a lot like
your father

KATHY
Really Do you think so

CLOSE-UP on the baby’s EYES Calm wise knowing

STEWART
I do

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT - END OF FLASHBACK

Stewart pulls the bathroom curtain back over the
memory He starts going through drawers in the
bathroom cabinet They are all empty Frustrated he
bends down and pulls the last one out hard

Something FALLS inside the cabinet His eyebrows go
up He pulls the drawer all the way out and sets it
on the floor

Reaches in all the way gropes around
pulls out something
Holds it flat in his hand

It’s an EPT WAND
INT OFFICE - MORNING

Tyler stares at the EPT wand on her desk

She sighs

TYLER

Where did you find this
STEWART

In our bathroom cabinet
TYLER

You broke into your house
STEWART

It’s my house
STEWART

Look I went to the store and
figured out how to read it
It says she’s pregnant

TYLER
Those tests aren’t absolute

STEWART
It’s good enough for me You’ve
got to call the police right now

TYLER
And tell them what That you’re
an idiot This can never be
entered into evidence

STEWART
Why not

TYLER
Because the police didn’t find it
You did Illegally

STEWART
It’s my house

Tyler rubs her temples

Her voice

TYLER
The tests from her autopsy will
come back soon We’1l1l know if
she was pregnant STEWART

softens

TYLER
If she was was ityours

STEWART
No

TYLER
Are you --

STEWART

If she was it was Wellington’s

TYLER
He says he was attending a speech
on prolotherapy at UCLA the night
of the murder And he claims that
he had a working relationship
with KATHY nothing more

STEWART
Liar The cops need to go back
and question him again

TYLER
Stewart they don’t care Why
should they when you make such
a lovely suspect

STEWART
The rose I told you about the
rose I know I had it with me I
was in the bathroom The killer
came back in the house or he
never left Why didn’t he kill

me too
TYLER

Maybe he was making a statement
STEWART

About what
TYLER

Jealousy maybe Sexual ownership

STEWART
So it would make sense that it
was Wellington Can’t you get
some kind of court order for DNA
testing Prove that was his baby
Or how about some fingerprints
The cops found a fingerprint in
the bathroom that wasn’t mine and
wasn’t Kathy’s

TYLER
We can’t get his DNA or his
fingerprints Not without

cause

I’1l find some cause

STEWART
No it’s for luck My mother

COURTROOM - A LITTLE LATER

The courtroom is silent as JACK BLAIR the lean tan
prosecutor rises to begin his opening statement

JUDGE BAXTER presides He’s old but his eyes
blaze Don’t mess with him

BLAIR
Stewart Mailer had a dark side
Something that lay hidden inside
him that began to spill out He
attacked a noted surgeon ina
restaurant unprovoked He
stalked his wife Kathy

He holds up a large photo of Kathy The people in the
courtroom take in her doomed face

The beautiful jawline The delicate brow the
long lashes the blue eyes

BLAIR
Kathy and Stewart had a terrible
argument on the day of March 2
2012 Two nights later March
3rd Stewart shot her with one of
his own guns

Stewart stares at Kathy’s picture transfixed His
eyes register fierce pain

BLAIR
In the coming days we will show
he had the means and the way We
will show you DNA evidence We
will show you the time-line and
the witnesses You see we have
something better than all the
tricks of persuasion his defense
can come up with

He stops lets it sink in

BLAIR
We have the truth

He returns to his seat The jury glances at Stewart
who shifts uncomfortably

Tyler rises
TYLER
Stewart Mailer is a victim of
circumstance a husband who
was truly sorrowful for his
actions and truly still felt
he could win his wife back If
the prosecutors have the
truth as they claim we can
all leave now Because the
truth is Stewart Mailer did
not murder his wife Stewart
Mailer is innocent

That was an accident

Tyler gives him a warning look

BLAIR
Was your sister afraid of Mr
