At the end is a signal On RED Waiting at it is the
same Airborne Express van Hall pulls up behind it
looks at his watch Yawns

In front of him the light changes to GREEN But the van

Breath hissing as he sprints back across the tracks

of HEADLIGHTS Getting closer

Hall claws his way up a muddy embankment Desperately
flags down the oncoming vehicle a minivan

The minivan stops Behind the wheel is an attractive
brunette SOCCER MOM No passengers Hall HAMMERS on her
window It lowers Hall gestures urgently behind him

HALL
Please there’re people

Hall’s voice dries up The Soccer Mom raising a SILENCED

CLAY

Kitson reaches for her prescription pad

( )

DR KITSON
I’m a GP not a psychiatrist but
I think I can offer a diagnosis
It’s called life Clay Or
rather mid-life

CLAY
That sounds serious

DR KITSON
It is Very

She likes this guy Not that he’d ever notice She
tears the prescription off Gives it to him

DR KITSON (CONTD)
This should deal with the
anxiety One pill no more than
twice a day And this should
do the rest of it

She writes him a second prescription Clay looks at it

CLAY
Sex

DR KITSON
With Nancy I mean
(feels herself blush)
Seriously It’s aerobic it’s
fun and it helps you sleep

But no more than twice a day

Still in his seat tension melting into relief

EXT CLAY’S BACK YARD - DAY

A SCREAMING MELEE of sugared-out KIDS and frayed PARENTS
amid balloons streamers and a jolly jumper Behind a
modest three-bedroom house the roof patched with tarps

The adults are a mixed bunch -- West Coast suburban plus
a hippie-ish element of which NANCY WESTON -- Clay’s
wife -- is a part Dusty blonde hair an intelligent
easy-going sexiness She’s trying to placate their 12-
year old son SAGE

SAGE
I just don’t see why I had to
share my party with a bunch of
first graders

NANCY
Otherwise wed have to have a
party for you one week then a
party for your sister a week
later

She breaks off to scoop up her sobbing 6-year old BOOT
SAGE
See she’s not having a good time

either

He slouches back to his friends Nancy sighs

ACROSS THE YARD

JEFF FRANKLIN -- a rangy humorous jock -- casually snaps
photos chats with Clay and a few other guys

JEFF
Well I guess we did it Clay
Weve stood true to that vow we
made in our dorm room with my
brother’s lousy weed Remember
Never we pledged never would we
surrender to bourgeois values

Laughter from the others Clay interjects

CLAY
Hey I’m here because you made me
stay Remember I wanted to go
back to Australia

JEFF
Did I say you couldnt I
thought staying had rather more
to do with the cute hippie chick
you met sneaking a cheeseburger
after her Peace Now meeting

CLAY
So bag on Nancy about being
bourgeois Look at her She’s
gone way more native than me

JEFF
Shes way sexier too so I’ll
forgive her

More laughter PHIL -- a flashy guy in Dockers and a TAG
watch -- announces

PHIL
You know I once knew the lyrics
to every song by Black Flag

JEFF
Bullshit

PHIL
It’s true

CLAY

(to Jeff)
Anyway the only thing you’ve
done different from me is not get
married

JEFF

CLAY
Okay and make a ton of money
doing whatever the hell it is you

NANCY
Come on it’s present time

CLAY
Uh-oh

SAGE OPENS A PACKAGE

Watched by everyone Around him are his other presents --
all military in nature The wrapping comes off A cell
phone Sage tries to hide his disappointment

SAGE
It’s great Dad thanks

An awkward beat Which Nancy breaks with another gift
NANCY
And this is your main gift --

from me and Dad

Clay looks as surprised as Sage who knows exactly what
it is Eagerly rips it open A paintball gun set

SAGE
I didn’t You two are the best

He hugs them both at once Clay raises an eyebrow at
Nancy She silences him with a look A PHONE starts
ringing in the house Nancy goes to pick up

Jeff surveys Sage’s war-themed gifts Looks to Clay

CLAY
Hey Hitler was a vegetarian

Nancy is back with the phone for Clay

NANCY

They share a look

CLAY ON THE PHONE

CLAY
It’s great Kelly he loves it

He looks at a neglected box containing a toy car then
at Sage who’s showing off his paintball gun

CLAY (CONTD)
I’m afraid he just took off with
his friends

So how are things with the house
Think the plumbing’1l survive

She sees Clay finish up the call

NANCY

Talking of which Phil may have
the answer to our roof problem
( )

CLAY

beat Turns his head back

Starts to walk slowly along the hallway Stops
BLOOD smeared on the walls and floor
Noises coming from behind a half-open DOOR

unsteady as he reaches out

BURSTS THROUGH the door behind him pipe swinging

Clay ducks Takes a glancing blow to the shoulder
Fluidly catches the pipe on the follow-through Twists
it free re-directing the force downward

Pipe SHATTERS the tweaker’s knee Howl of pain stumbles

askew in the ground in front of them ELIJAH

Clipped to the photograph a handwritten list of names
