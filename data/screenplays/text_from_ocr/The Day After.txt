with your hurt feelings and Moms

OAKES

All I asked was why you chose Boston

the problen

They resume walking away from PANNING CAMERA

Moynihan-type DIPLOMAT gives his views on the current

DIPLOMAT 2 (ON TV)

NATO since our insistence on
positioning medium-range Pershing

prompted Great Britain to reconsider
its own nuclear commitment scrub
it altogether if the Labour Party
has its way

TV HOST
Where does that leave the West
Germans
DIPLOMAT

Well They dont want their country
to be a battleground for the
superpowers anymore than the British
do but theyre opting for nuclear
independence like the French rather
than withdrawing as the English are
considering That is why Bonn has
just given its three-month notice of
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty They want
their own weapons

TV HOST
But the West Germans already have
access to our weapons through NATO

Ellen passes through living room with laudry

DIPLOMAT
Conditionally yes With the blessing
of the Supreme Allied Commander in
NATO who is of course an American
And thats their great fear that
when the chips are down and the red
lights are blinking the United
States wont really be willing to
sacrifice Chicago for Hamburg as the
saying goes

In the kitchen Kenny and Sarah are quarreling over
the hot cookie sheet It flips over hurling hot
cookies all over the floor Kenny starts crying
loudly Ellen rushes in to make peace starts pick-
ing up the cookies Sarah shoos the dog away

DIPLOMAT

So the Germans feel they have no
alternative but to build their
own something the Soviets have
dreaded since the end of the Second
World War
