EXT ROCKY LANDSCAPE —- DAY

1A

SUPER TITLES as we move across a black rocky landscape
Canyons and crevices pitted and gnarled — alien

Panning up off the rocks — not an alien world but the
jagged volcanic rocks of Auckland’s North Shore - to
reveal RANGITOTO ISLAND on the other side of the water
Dark and sinister

EXT RANGITOTO BEACH - DAY

The prow of a small boat bumps against jagged black
rocks Tight shots as two young men help one another out
of the boat onto the rocks hand clasping hand

Struggling to balance on jagged volcanic rock they
steady each other at last finding their footing JOHAN
and LENART — IDENTICAL TWINS with COPPER HAIR dressed in
coarse 19th century clothing

Ahead of them a man stands with his back to us looking
up at the dark cone of Rangitoto He turns to them — this
is MR JONES grey weathered ageless

MR JONES
When we get to the crater use your twin-
ness Throw the stones as one

JOHAN
I think we can

MR JONES
You have to believe it

Mr Jones looks to Lenart less certain than his brother

LENART
But what if they come
MR JONES
They’re dormant We’1l take them by

surprise

The three of them head for the tree line

EXT RANGITOTO BUSH — DAY

Figures push through the thick island scrub — Johan and
Lenart lead followed by Mr Jones Lenart strides ahead
pushing through the undergrowth

MR JONES
Stay together

Noises rattle through the trees around them
The twins spin pulling two round STONES from their
pockets and brandishing them like weapons A warm fiery

glow spills from between their fingers

Shapes dart in the trees all around them A chorus of
horrible otherworldly BARKS rings out

A DARK SHAPE seems to lash out of the shadows — Johan
falls — his stone skitters across the ground —

LENART
Johan

Johan looks up at his brother stricken —

He reaches for his fallen stone —

But is YANKED suddenly into the shadows with a SHRIEK
Lenart looks to Mr Jones desperately —

LENART (CONT’D)
Help us Mr Jones

Mr Jones stumbles back deciding what he must do —
He looks down to see Johan’s stone lying at his feet
CUT TO
EXT RANGITOTO ISLAND —- DAY
The perfect volcanic cone black against the sky

LENART (0S)
Please

EXT COUNTRY TOWN - DAY

Dense bush rolls over rugged hills Black clouds boil in
the sky

A straight road leads out of a small COUNTRY VILLAGE
through fenced paddocks A SCHOOLBAG tumbles over a
fence

A teenage girl wearing a schoolbag RACHEL climbs the
fence and looks back She grins holds out a hand

RACHEL
Need help

A teen boy THEO appears and clambers up the fence

THEO
No

As he gets to the top his foot slips on the wire
Instinctively he throws out a hand Rachel meets it with
her own steadying him on the fence

The pair are about 14 and have the same COPPER HAIR and
green eyes they’re unmistakably TWINS

They both jump down Rachel grabs Theo’s bag and runs
off Theo in pursuit They run together up the road —
matched for speed Rachel just ahead
EXT FARMHOUSE GATE - DAY
At a wide gate they cross the road Rachel swings the bag
around flinging it under a hedge She starts down the
long driveway as Theo runs for his bag

beaten house ahead

The Policeman looks up his compassionate expression
chilling

Bursting into the KITCHEN Rachel runs to her father She
searches his face for an answer to the question she’s
afraid to ask He nods tears streaming down his face

Rachel trembles with shock —

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY

Theo stops in his tracks trembling as Rachel is —
FEELING WHAT SHE’S FEELING

Theo approaches the house with trepidation He climbs the
porch pulls open the door

INT FARMHOUSEVARIOUS - DAY
Theo heads down the hallway fearful
IN THE KITCHEN Rachel looks up — face wracked with
grief
In the hall Theo reels back against the wall feeling
her pain frozen —
IN THE KITCHEN Rachel looks towards the door that
separates them
RACHEL (VO)
Theo
IN THE HALLWAY Theo shakes his head unable to bear it
We hear her voice in his mind again desperate
RACHEL (VO)
Theo I need you
Something seems to snap Theo scrambles back up the hall
slams through the screen door and stumbles out onto the
lawn
RACHEL (VO)
Theo I —
The screen door BANGS behind him — her voice cutting off
in his mind as though a door between them has SLAMMED
SHUT
We push in towards the screen door watching him then

PULL FOCUS to the mesh shutting out everything beyond

EXT COUNTRY CHURCHYARD — DAY 16

A dark hole in the ground a GRAVE Gathered around it
are two dozen MOURNERS in dark clothing and an Anglican
Reverend REVEREND BLATTY

REVEREND BLATTY
I am the resurrection and the life saith
the Lord he that believeth in me though
he were dead yet shall he live and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die

Standing on either side of the grave is Theo and Rachel
the hole in the ground a dark chasm between them Theo
looks to the head of the grave where their father kneels
over the edge of the hole sobbing

Rachel steps forward scattering a handful of rose petals
into the grave

Theo clutches a handful of petals his expression
impassive

Rachel searches Theo’s face looking for some way in
Tears roll down her cheeks He meets her eyes for a
moment then looks away His petals are clenched in his
fist knuckles white

We CUT WIDE a cluster of dark figures small in the
landscape The dark sky boils overhead

elbow smacks the door —

CLEMENTINE
Ow

RICKY

A CELL PHONE RINGS

RICKY bolts upright bangs his head grimaces

secluded park

Rachel pulls back the curtains to reveal —

A spectacular view of the lake Houses walkways and
parks encircle its shore

Under gathering clouds the water seems black

EXT AUNT and UNCLE’S DECK - DAY

Theo looks out at the lake at the end of the garden

Houses ring the shimmering water It’s darkly beautiful

Only when they erupt But there hasn’t

UNDER THE MOUNTAIN © 2008 Redhead Films 12

EXT AUNT and UNCLE’S BACK GARDEN - DAY 29

Theo walks down the lawn to the lake’s edge He stops and
sniffs recoiling at a smell

He looks out across the lake scanning the houses around
the shore

His eyes fall on one He steps forward to see better
Across an inlet is a two-story wooden house its
weatherboards flaky and peeling More than 100 years old
the craggy verandahs and dark windows make the house feel
like a dark sentinel watching the lake

RACHEL (0S)
What’s that smell

Rachel is behind him Theo doesn’t look up

THEO
I dunno

RACHEL
Like rotten cabbages Is it the water

Theo looks back across the lake to the house

THEO
I can’t smell anything

He turns and walks up the lawn Rachel watches him go
frustrated

She steps out to the edge of the water and looks out at

the old house Spooky place

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S LIVING ROOM - DUSK 30

stuff

Rachel goes pale at talk of funeral parlours and bodies

RACHEL
Shut up Theo

THEO
He might embalm you if he catches you —

RACHEL
Shut up

A LOW RUMBLE The house SHAKES around them — an
EARTHQUAKE Theo looks around wide-eyed as the
furniture and knick-knacks shift and rattle

Quickly the tremor subsides They exchange glances
scared — thrilled — then everyone talks as once

KAY
God another one

CLIFF
Don’t everybody get under the table at
once

RICKY

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 31

Rachel emerges from the bathroom in her pyjamas heads
down the hall

MURMURS come from inside Ricky’s room Rachel pauses in
the doorway eavesdropping

THROUGH THE GAP we can see Ricky lying on his bed
talking quietly on his phone

The tall figure of a MAN stands in the shadows under the
rusting verandah He seems to be looking back at Rachel

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT 34B

Rachel stares back a little spooked

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S HOUSEKITCHEN - MORNING 35
A note on the bench reads GONE TO WORK - EAT REAL FOOD

A large kitchen with expensive fittings A small TV
switched on the sound muted On the bench is a selection
of cereal boxes Theo scans them trying to decide

MOMENTS LATER Theo serves himself a bowl of ice cream
and starts eating

On TV a smiling TV NEWS READER talks against a backdrop
image of CENTRAL AUCKLAND and the heading Auckland
Shaken Theo grabs the REMOTE and switches on the sound —

NEWS READER
Aucklanders ducked for cover last night
as the latest in a series of small
earthquakes rattled the region The
shallow jolt measured 37 on the Richter
Scale and was centred on Rangitoto
Island The Seismic Research Institute
said today that the quake is unlikely to
be an indication of volcanic activity
and Aucklanders have no cause for alarm

(beat )

The meat industry is breathing a sigh of
relief today after lamb exports were
given the all clear following an
unexplained incident at a lower North
Island sheep station

THEO
(to himself)
Bleeding skies
Theo sits in a soft couch with his back to the lake He’s
reading a hardback book — VOLCANOES OF AUCKLAND circa
the 1980s He flips through the pages

A MAP OF AUCKLAND shows the VOLCANOES marked in red

EXT AUNT and UNCLE’S HOUSE - DAY 37
Rachel in a bright life jacket drags a kayak down the
grass to the water’s edge She climbs in and pushes off
EXT LAKE PUPUKE —- DAY 38

Rachel cuts across the black water paddling carefully
but confidently

She peers down into the darkness spooked — it’s deep
down there

Rachel looks up to find she’s nearing the Wilberforce
house Dead trees frame the house skeletal fingers
reaching out across the water

Seen from the lake through leafless branches and tangled
vines the Wilberforce house is dark and tumbledown
weatherboards thick with moss roof rotten and sunken-in
windows dark No signs of life

CREEAAK The back door opens just a crack Something
moves in the darkness beyond

Rachels eyes widen then she squeals as a branch

snags her hair

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 39
Theo jerks reaches to his head

He looks out to where Rachel and the kayak bob in the
shadow of the dead trees

EXT LAKE PUPUKE —- DAY 40

With a last glance at the old house she turns and
paddles for shore
EXT LAKESHORE - DAY 41

Rachel drags the kayak out of the water into the reeds at
the lakes edge She looks back at the Wilberforce house

A figure picks its way down from his house towards the
lakeshore

Rachel ducks behind the reeds watching

EXT WILBERFORCE HOUSE - DAY 42
Under the shadow of the house the man moves as if slowed
and bent by age but his frame is monumental His lined
face seems roughly hewn from stone eyes black holes

under heavy brows

MR WILBERFORCE reaches into the dead tree He takes
something from its branches opens his hand to reveal —

Rachels hair tie Mr Wilberforce slowly raises his hand
to his face and seems to SNIFF at the hair
EXT LAKESHORE - DAY 43

Rachel watches horrified

EXT WILBERFORCE HOUSE - DAY 44
Mr Wilberforce closes a club-like fist around her hair

tie and crunches back up the path to his house

EXT LAKESHORE - DAY 45
Rachel shrinks chilled She looks around the lawn
suddenly feeling vulnerable

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 46
In the living room Theo turns to the next page More

images — another volcano — a grassy cone with a view out
over the city

UNDER THE MOUNTAIN © 2008 Redhead Films 19

EXTINT MT EDEN ROADRICKY’S CAR - DAY 47

Ricky’s car drives through the centre of Mt Eden towards
the grassy cone of the volcano towering above

A sign reads MT EDEN SUMMIT

Ricky’s car follows the road up towards Mt Eden Ricky
drives the twins crammed into the car with him

Craggy trees line the road like a tunnel of gnarled
talons sunlight filtering through in eerie shafts

Rachel’s eyes widen —

A DARK FIGURE can be glimpsed between the trunks still
as a statue as if watching the car

Rachel looks back — the figure is gone hidden by the
trees

EXT MT EDEN CRATERVIEWING PLATFORM - DAY 48

A huge grassed bowl — the crater of this not-long-dead
volcano Rachel Theo and Ricky stand on the platform
dwarfed by the scale of it Beyond over city and water
is Rangitoto

RICKY
(pointing)
That’s One Tree Hill Mt Krakatoa over
there Mt Vesuvius Mt Etna That’s

North Head and Rangitoto

Rachel shivers against the cold

RACHEL
I thought Auckland was supposed to be
warm

I’m gonna find some volcanic rock
Theo jumps down off the stone wall and heads around the
crater
EXT MT EDEN CRATER RIM —- DAY 49
Theo marches around the edge putting all his being into

walking hard making himself feel nothing else A cold
wind whips at him the sky is grey

( )

He stops and looks down into the deep hole the people
the bottom tiny

EXT MT EDEN CRATERVIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

Rachel looks out across the city Ricky leans on the
fence texting

Beyond Theo strides around the crater rim
Ricky looks up from his phone watches Theo

RICKY
Is he okay

RACHEL
I can’t get through to him It’s like
he’s on another planet

EXT MT EDEN CRATER RIM - DAY

Theo looks up to the crest of the hill above him A
figure sits silhouetted on the edge facing Rangitoto

Mr Jones is barely older than when we last saw him but
he seems a shadow of his former self beaten the fire
has died in his eyes He stares across at the black
island opposite

A warm glow of FIRELIGHT dances on his face emanating
from his hands

Theo approaches the old man from behind A flicker of
FLAME in his hands Theo peers closer intrigued

As Theo steps up Jones closes his hands the fire
disappears He stuffs whatever made the fire into the
pockets of his jacket

He turns to Theo his eyes blazing with momentary
interest He looks up at Theo’s copper hair

Theo raises a hand to his hair involuntarily The man
seems to stare into him read him as if looking for an
answer from him

Theo turns and hurries on around the crater As he goes
the light in the old man’s eyes dies — as if he was
searching for something and realised with
disappointment it wasn’t to be found with Theo

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 53

Theo reads the volcano book open on his lap Rachel
talks on the phone trying to shield the mouthpiece from
the argument in the kitchen

RACHEL
(into the phone)
Nothing got broken but the whole house
was shaking

KAY (0S)
You have to start taking some
responsibility Richard

CLIFF (0S)

A “commitment” is where you actually have
to do whatever it is you said you’d do

RICKY
Like I need reminding

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 55
Ricky stomps past as Rachel holds the phone out to Theo
THEO
(without looking up)
I’m reading

RACHEL
It’s just voicemail

She’s still holding out the phone He sighs takes it
then waits At last she gets his drift and leaves the
room

As soon as she’s gone Theo switches off the phone and
puts it aside

He picks up the book In a sepia-toned photograph a

group of settlers picnics on the shore of Lake Pupuke A
man stands apart looking towards the camera MR JONES

Theo frowns There’s something familiar about the old man
in the photo

EXT AUNT and UNCLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 56

The house glows pale like boxes of reflected moonlight
on the dark shore

Rachel looks out the window in the direction of the
Wilberforce house — then pulls the curtains across

In the darkness a sickly SNIFFING sound like some
guttural animal following a scent

SHAPES melt out of the darkness — one three five more
dark sentinels push forward from the shadows In the
darkness we can make out several MEN IN DARK SUITS

They stare up at the house watching waiting

EXT AUNT and UNCLE’S HOUSE - DAY 57

Ricky comes out of the house followed by Theo and
Rachel They join Uncle Cliff who glares down at the
lawn his expression dark

CLIFF
(to Ricky)
You lot know anything about this

Dead patches of grass blot the lawn Trails of brown lead
back to the edge of the lake

RICKY
Nope

CLIFF
Well I haven’t been out here

RICKY
Why is everything my fault It’s outside
their room anyway

The trail of footprints does indeed lead towards Rachel
and Theo’s window

Rachel and Theo follow the trail to below their window
RACHEL

(quietly to Theo)
Someone’s spying on us

Theo’s eyes alight with excitement

THEO
Yeah

She meets his gaze spooked then turns to look back
across at the Wilberforce house

EXT HAURAKI GULF - DAY 58

Rangitoto — as seen from the surface of the sea a black
pyramid filling the horizon

Uncle Cliff stands on the deck of a bobbing boat — THE
SEA LADY — expertly playing and casting a large fishing
rod Ricky sits behind wearing a lifejacket and holding
his phone in the air trying to get a signal

A snorkel surfaces from the black water in a puff of
spray Theo follows it coming up for air He turns
towards the mountain treading water

Theo jerks under —

— then comes up spluttering Rachel surfaces behind him
and laughs

THEO
Dick

Theo swims back towards the boat Rachel looks up at the
looming black peak and frowns as though remembering
something once said to her

RACHEL
Bleeding skies

She GASPS suddenly catching a glimpse of —

A FIGURE lurking in the trees above the rocks at the
water’s edge A Wilberforce DRONE

Chilled Rachel swims strongly to the boat and hauls
herself on board She looks back towards the island —
there’s no sign of the Drone now —

Suddenly Cliff’s fishing rod SCREAMS as the reel
unwinds He grabs the handle reels furiously The rod
bends alarmingly He shouts —

— and heaves a flapping fish over the side of the boat
The others jump back as he lowers it to the deck

Well dont just stand there
EXT NORTH SHORE BOAT RAMP - DAY

The glassy-eyed fish hits a sheet of newspaper laid out
on the asphalt

A concrete boat ramp leads down to a sandy North Shore

Theo wrinkles his nose and looks around frowns as
something further around the road catches his eye

EXT CAR PARK - DAY

Theo holds his hand over his nose and mouth as he

approaches the Wilberforces’ hearse parked under trees

Rachel scampers to catch up with him

RACHEL
It’s a hearse Must be them — the
Wilberforces

She stops her hand going to her nose Theo gags

THEO
It stinks

RACHEL
The same as at the lake

The twins reach the hearse The back doors are closed
Something viscous drips from them onto the ground

Theo cups his hand against the back window to peer in
His breath fogs the glass Something coats the inside
obscuring the view He reaches for the door handle

RACHEL (CONTD)
Maybe we shouldnt

Theo pulls the doors open It opens with a SCHLUK like
wound being pulled open Stringy slime clings to the
edges

The twins grimace in disgust as they see —

The hearse interior is warped and gnarled crusted with
glistening layers of organic matter

Theo reaches out to touch the fleshy interior then jerks
his hand back

RACHEL (CONTD)
What is it hot

THEO
Its cold

RACHEL
I wonder what they’re doing here

Rachel turns looks out to sea Rangitoto lurks on the
horizon beyond the dark water

Theo bursts into Ricky’s dark bedroom binoculars and a
torch in his hand

RICKY
Theo

Theo goes to the window

THEO
Keep the light off that’s good

He peers through the binoculars

There is a thump and rustle from behind him Theo lowers
the binoculars and turns around

Ricky glowers at Theo as Clementine sitting on the edge
of the bed pulls her T-shirt on over her bra

Theo stares open mouthed Clementine glares back at him

CLEMENTINE
Enjoying the view

She pushes past Theo and goes to the window She pushes

She throws a leg over the sill and jumps out the window

Theo watches her go and then looks back to Ricky
THEO
Whoa
RICKY

Thanks a lot Theo

THEO
Is she your girlfriend Have you

Ricky collapses on his bed pulls his pillow over his
head and MOANS

RICKY
No

Theo watches him for a minute Ricky plays dead Theo
goes back to the window training the binoculars on the
Wilberforce house

THEO
You think they’re home

RICKY
(muffled under covers )
It’s just a creepy old house

THEO

Then let’s go check it out

Ricky wrenches his pillow from his face

RICKY
Cause it’s a creepy old house

house

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT 62

Rachel lies on the bed reading The sound of a door
opening offscreen She gets up and goes to the window

She sees movement —
OUTSIDE Theo steps out of Ricky’s glass doors into the
back garden
EXT AUNT and UNCLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 63
Ricky leans out of the doors
RICKY

Don’t blame me if Mr Wilberforce keeps a

shotgun under his bed or something
He slams the door shut
Theo turns on the torch and heads around the lakeshore
towards the Wilberforce house
EXT WILBERFORCE HOUSE - NIGHT 64
The torch beam picks out the craggy trees — pale claws of
wood dance in the darkness Theo picks his way through
skeletal bushes
His torch picks out an OLD SIGN lying tangled in dead
creepers and branches Theo clears them away to reveal
the faded words beneath WILBERFORCE FUNERAL SERVICES
He clicks off the light and watches breathing quietly

The house is silent the door closed

Slipping from his hiding place Theo darts up the bare
ground to the house

He tries to peer through the boards on the windows then
steps up on the porch — wooden boards creak The front
door seems to be locked Theo pushes on it
experimentally — it opens a crack —

FOOTSTEPS crunch toward him from the darkness He
plasters himself against the wall — pinned exposed —

Rachel shields her eyes from the sudden glare

RACHEL (CONTD)
Dont go in there

THEO
I can do what I want

He turns off the torch and heads back into the house

INT WILBERFORCE HOUSE - NIGHT 65
Rachel appears behind Theo and they stare open mouthed

What may have once been rooms furniture or stairs have
decayed into an open cavernous space

Everything grows with twisted organic matter — as if the
house itself has formed out of gnarled scar tissue

The twins creep forward to look taking it in with
horror Theo swings the torch slowly around Vague
remnants of wooden beams and doorways poke from the awful
fleshiness

A sudden JOLT as though someone just picked the house up
and shook it — then a CLATTER as an EARTHQUAKE rolls
through the house its ancient weatherboards shifting and
groaning Dust sifts down from above

Silence The twins look around wide-eyed

MR WILBERFORCE (0S)
The gargantua

DRONE (0OS)
They shake the earth

The twins jump at the sound of the voices coming from
the door to outside They duck into the shadow of a
hallway Theo fumbles to kill the torch

Theo turns off the light just as two tall figures step
into the room - MR WILBERFORCE and a WILBERFORCE DRONE

MR WILBERFORCE
Soon they are free

Mr Wilberforce looks suddenly towards Rachel and Theo and
SNIFFS

Rachel and Theo pull back into the shadows holding their
breath

DRONE
What

MR WILBERFORCE
Twins — on the lake I smell them

DRONE
Does the fire-raiser know

MR WILBERFORCE
The fire-raiser is old No warm in its
bones

DRONE
If the twins find the fire-raiser

MR WILBERFORCE
Then we make them dead

The twins exchange horrified glances

A SUCKING SOUND Theo peers around broken boards and old
joists trying to see into the hallway A glimpse of the
Drone disappearing into the hole in the floor with
another weird SLURP

Rachel and Theo wait a moment then step hesitantly out
of the shadows

RACHEL
(whispers )
Are they gone

THEO
Yeah — down that hole

RACHEL
I was trying to tell you — they can smell
us just like we can smell them

Theo heads across the room torch raised

We have to go Come on

Theo arrives at the edge of the hole and peers down The
torch beam picks out details of another fleshy space —
even more organic than that above it A sealed membrane
BARRP The membrane undulates draws back — revealing a
rippling tunnel Rachel and Theo recoil — Theo drops the
torch — it tumbles into the darkness
The twins freeze eyes on the hole in the floor Silence
then a horrible clattering BARK rings out from far
below

The twins break for the door

EXT WILBERFORCE HOUSE - NIGHT 66
The twins run down the back steps and into the dead

bushes at the lake’s edge

EXT LAKESIDE - NIGHT 67
The twins pick their way through the bushes

Behind them Mr Wilberforce appears on the porch

RACHEL
Look

The twins duck down and watch as Mr Wilberforce scans the
lakeshore He holds THEO’S TORCH in his hand

The twins cringe as another hideous BARK rings out

INT AUNT and UNCLE’S GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT 68

reverberate around them as their fingers almost connect

Whispers swirl as Rachel’s voice resonates in Theo’s
mind

Youre mistaken

Youre the fire-raiser

Mr Jones frowns surprised

MR JONES
No — my name is Jones

Mr Jones hands Theo back the book

MR JONES
I don’t know anyone by that name And I
don’t know you

He turns and walks away

his gaze

A GANGLY FIGURE stands silhouetted on the far side of the

stepping out of the shadows onto the porch of his house

He looks straight at her

She ducks back from the window

Silence

Rachel stares at the door breathless The wood around
the door handle begins to fester and decay A spreading
patch becomes the sickly dead flesh of the Wilberforces’
house

The lock sloughs away the door slams open BANGING on

the end of the chain The Policeman’s hand and the door
are melded together his fingers disappearing into the

rotting surface of the door

Now fingers push out of the surface of the door —
becoming an arm — part flesh part wood part uniformed
sleeve — that reaches up for the chain

The fingers claw the latch of the chain and gouge it out

The door bursts open and the Policeman steps in His face
has lost its shape hanging loose and wet His uniform
seems to be running into his flesh detail blurring

ill-formed a fleshy club

turns and scrambles up them The Policeman strides up
after her

Rachel runs along the mezzanine around the corner to the
bedrooms

The Policeman strides forward menacingly confident now
He pauses at the corner steps powerfully into the
bedroom —

And finds empty room and closet doors He sniffs
And homes in on a door He snatches it open —

A GOLF BAG falls out clubs tumbling The Policeman
twitches peers into the closet —

Rachel EXPLODES out swinging a GOLF CLUB She smashes at
the Policeman — he recoils barely — and snarls

His face shudders skin blisters what looks like
wormlike tentacles ripple beneath the surface of his
flesh as the Policeman becomes MR WILBERFORCE

Rachel gasps She throws the club at Wilberforce he
smashes it to the left she ducks past on the right

She gets to the balcony of the mezzanine clambers over
jumps —

As Wilberforce reaches out and grabs her arm arresting
her fall jerking her horribly

Rachel screams in pain and terror Wilberforce’s hand
STRETCHES from his body his wrist and dark suited sleeve
a fibrous melange Strands like tiny tentacles whip
around Rachel’s arm binding her to him

The fabric of Rachel’s top becomes one with Wilberforce’s
flesh growing into it like a festering wound

grey of Mr Wilberforce’s touch

McMansions that seem determined to encroach upon its

The crackle seems to build to a rushing point Behind the
neighbours a hot light flares — and the twins and Mr
Jones materialise in front of the cottage

Jones collapses to his knees coughing and hacking Both
twins are soaked with sweat They look around stunned
to have found themselves somewhere else

The ones you call the Wilberforces were a
predatory race They were merciless
cunning greedy Their hunger for power
was great All they lacked was the
strength to conquer then they found
the gargantua

THEO
“Gargantua”

MR JONES
Creatures with the power to lay waste to
entire worlds The Wilberforces tamed
them They evolved together over
countless generations They learned to
travel through space To make whole
worlds their own And they did it again

emanating

Yeah

Pick it up

Theo picks up the stone Faint WHISPERS swirl around
them

Theo stares into his stone The whispers grow louder
Ripples of fire shimmer across its surface

Open your mind to the stone Feel its
power let it feel yours

The stone pulses hypnotic

An image emerges

EXT NORTH HEAD BEACH —- DAY 100

A North Shore beach but untouched pristine A tiny boat
is beached just above the waterline

A tree at the edge of the beach has a CRUDE CIRCLE drawn
on its trunk

Johan one of the young men we saw earlier steps into
frame one of the stones clenched in his hand He looks
across —

To his twin Lenart also holding his own stone They
hold out their fists eyes narrowing in concentrated
thought —

The stones glow —

WHOMP A nimbus of fire encircles each fist then arcs
out from the stone SCORCHING the tree right where the
target is drawn

They beam triumphant

Rachel reaches for the stone It lies grey and cold in
her hand then starts to glow whispering

Jones’s eyes alight Rachel smiles

The glow intensifies white-hot The whispers rise to a
cacophony of screams Smoke rises from between her
clenched fingers

Rachel screams and drops the stone

The stone lands on the table Its surface fades to cool
grey once again

gets up and runs outside

Mr Wilberforce circles away from the stone Theo comes
around the other way The stone flares brighter

Mr Wilberforce steps suddenly across to block the front
door cutting off their escape He advances on them
menacingly

Rachel and Theo stumble back through the sagging arch of
a decaying doorway They’re pushed back into a dark
hallway thick with the Wilberforces’ rot

The way behind them is blocked —

But beside them is a twisted staircase Theo pushes
Rachel up then turns back towards Mr Wilberforce He
holds up a shaking hand glowing with fire

Wilberforce steps towards him down the passage a tall
shadow in the darkness his movements deliberate
relentless

Theo backs up the stairs breathing hard

FINGERS wrap around her MOUTH — she’s pulled back into

Theo wheels around on the stairs holding up the stone
trying to see —

He races up the last few steps

Upstairs the ruined house is less decayed — though
patches of the Wilberforces’ fleshy rot seep up the walls
into the faded wallpaper

climbs the stairs

Ahead of Theo a DRONE holds the struggling Rachel

smile It shakes its head

stone Theo’s eyes widen in surprise

The Drone SQUEALS and drops Rachel backing into a dark
room Theo rushes to her and helps her up

RACHEL
How did you do that

THEO
I don’t know

The twins run down the hallway to a closed door ahead
Theo turns the handle — it’s locked

Mr Wilberforce reaches the top of the stairs and advances
down the hallway his tall frame filling the passage

Though he still looks human his skin and clothes seem to
run with slime and ichor — his form breaking down He
breathes wetly and steps forward

Theo holds up his glowing stone

THEO (CONT’D)
Stop

MR WILBERFORCE
Why do you resist because the fire-
raiser tells you

THEO
Cause we’re not gonna let you have our
planet

They back away down the hall as Wilberforce advances
trailing slime His form seems to be losing cohesion his
proportions exaggerated by the shifting shadows

The Drone stands behind him joined now by a SECOND
DRONE reaching the top of the stairs In the shifting
shadows the cramped hallway seems crowded with ghastly
Wilberforces

Mr Wilberforce’s arms seem distended his hands the

sleeves of his jacket split into tentacles that writhe
and flick

their way into the floor The wood bubbles and blisters

RACHEL (CONT’D)
out

A vast shadowy cavern It stretches into the distance
lit by an eerie glow The huge space — a football field
in length — is gnarled with putrescent Wilberforce
growth

The twins have fallen from the tunnel onto a raised rib
that cuts through a sea of slime to another tunnel
opening in the far wall of the chamber

But dominating the space is a CREATURE The kids’ mouths
fall open as they take in a vast supertanker of flesh — a
horrible wall of skin and scales a writhing suggestion
of mighty tentacles

A massive slug-like creature wallows in the mire Its
form rises and falls in time with the rumble of its
breathing

Rachel and Theo stare dwarfed by its scale

The beast unfolds a great tentacle and shifts its almost
unimaginable bulk Great waves of flesh seem to roll past
as it turns

The chamber shakes churning up great waves of scum The
twins recoil falling to their feet

The beast opens a ghastly maw and expels a roar of septic
air The twins cover their noses and mouths

THEO

back up into it

The black altar of Rangitoto island The night we saw in
the opening scene

Familiar SCREAMS resonate — the sound of Johan and Lenart
being attacked by the Wilberforces

EXT RANGITOTO BUSH - DAY 148

A flurry of action — we’ve seen this scene before
Knocked off balance Johan falls — his stone hits the
ground —

LENART
Johan

Johan reaches for his fallen stone only to be dragged
into the shadows by the Wilberforces This time we
glimpse the tentacled horror lurking in the trees as it
snatches him away

Lenart looks to Mr Jones desperately

LENART (CONT’D)
Help us Mr Jones

Mr Jones stumbles back deciding what he must do

LENART (CONT’D)
Please

Mr Jones shakes his head sadly almost imperceptibly

A horrible SCREAM rings through the bush as though Johan
is being torn apart Shadows close in on Lenart and Mr
Jones

LENART (CONT’D)
Please Mr Jones

Shaking Mr Jones turns away As he closes his eyes
tight a single tear runs down his cheek Fire rolls
across him and WHOMP He’s gone

Lenart stands alone lost and afraid He looks up in
terror as the Wilberforces loom —

Theo circles Mr Jones furious

THEO
You just left them there

MR JONES
They were weak —

THEO
Expendable you mean

MR JONES

(roars)

I HAD NO CHOICE

The fire dims to a flicker

MR JONES (CONT’D)
They had Johan — Lenart alone was useless
to me If I’d risked myself to save them
who would’ve been left to find more twins

THEO
You don’t need twins I can make the fire
— enough for both of us

Mr Jones looks up his eyes piercing Theo

MR JONES
Rachel believes in your twin-ness It’s
her belief that gives you power

THEO
But at the beach —

MR JONES
You were weak

Theo leaps to his feet

THEO
No they were afraid of me

MR JONES
(roars)
Only because she believes

Theo stares at him trembling with a fury that masks his
own fear

THEO
You’re wrong I’1ll prove it

INT NORTH HEAD TUNNELS - NIGHT 150

Rachel runs down a long passage the light of Mr Jones’s
flame far behind her

RACHEL
Theo Come back

Her voice echoes met with stony silence She stops — as
far into the gloom as she dares go

RACHEL (CONT’D)
I know you’re afraid But we can do this
I know we can

She stares into the darkness straining to see searching
for him She closes her eyes searching now for his mind

RACHEL (VO) (CONT’D)
Theo please

Silence At last she opens her eyes tears welling

RACHEL (CONT’D)
(whispers )
I need you

Rachel sighs alone in the dark She turns and trudges
back up the tunnel towards the firelight

Nothing stirs in the darkness then a ripple of FIRE
like gasoline igniting courses out from the stone in
Theo’s hand revealing him right there watching her go

Wordlessly he turns and heads down the tunnel determined
and alone

Rachel kneels beside him

RACHEL
Mr Jones

He opens his eyes
RACHEL (CONT’D)
He’s gone on ahead We have to get to the

He leans heavily on her as they get to their feetFrom
deep in the tunnels a distant BARK rings out Rachel and

Mr Jones look around alarmed

Ricky and Clementine straining together heave the boat
to the back of the car and hook up the trailer

Inside Ricky starts the car He revs the engine trying
to pull away He cringes at the loud whine of his little
car and yet the boat doesn’t move He looks
sheepishly to Clementine

He revs again The car seems horribly loud in the night
as Slowly the car and boat start to move He heads up
the drive his car straining

EXT TAKAPUNA STREET - NIGHT 157A

The car reaches the top of the driveway Ricky looks
back checking the boat —

Clementine yelps in fright

Uncle Cliff fully dressed stands in front of the car
Ricky slams on the brakes and slumps against the wheel

CLIFF
Where are you going

Ricky winds the window down a couple of inches

RICKY
Would you believe night fishing

CLIFF
Get out of the car

RICKY
Dad I know this doesn’t look good But
this time I’m asking you just to —

CLIFF
Get out of the car

RICKY
Dad you’re just gonna have to trust me
if I say I’ve gotta do something
important it’s important

Ricky looks him up and down to see his father’s hand

stretching and distorting into a tangle of fibrous
tentacles His face drops —

As the creature swings its arm like a club —

CRASHING through the passenger window Fine tentacles
whip around Ricky’s face the seat the ceiling of the
car —

Clementine screams recoils in horror

Ricky slams down on the accelerator —

The car pulls away dragging the CLIFFWILBERFORCE along
Ricky is pulled hard against the door by the tentacles
He shakes to get his head free The tentacles wrap
themselves around the steering wheel the door —

The creature hanging from the door shudders and convulses
as it changes from Uncle Cliff into a Wilberforce Drone

Wilberforce hearse roars after him

At the door the Drone BARKS grotesquely its face savage
as it bounces around dragging on the road

The Drone flails hitting the road in a tumble of

tentacles — right in the path of the oncoming hearse The
hearse screeches to a halt

The car roars down the boat ramp Ricky tries to reverse
the trailer into the water going the wrong way
correcting at last getting it right Ricky and

Clementine scramble out

The ominous clatter of the approaching hearse lights
on the horizon

The SEA LADY slips free of the trailer Ricky clambers
aboard pulling Clementine up after him —

A sudden ROAR — Ricky and Clementine look up —

The hearse speeds off the boat ramp and soars overhead
crashing into the water

Bubbles on the surface dark shapes surface near the
hearse and begin to give chase

Ricky tries to start the boat as the Wilberforces
approach It coughs once — twice — and catches The boat
motors away from the boat ramp leaving the Drones
behind

They start down the tunnel — a clatter of Wilberforce
BARKS from ahead of them or perhaps behind Rachel
and Mr Jones pause disoriented

ELSEWHERE IN THE TUNNELS

A Wilberforce Drone steps into the light searching for
the twins In human form starting to fray a little at
the edges Two more Drones emerge from the darkness
behind it

The Drone sniffs — chooses a tunnel and starts down it —

WHOMP A burst of flame momentarily drives them back
coming from —

Mr Jones hiding in wait with Rachel

They hurry back into the dark as the Wilberforces recover
and stalk up the tunnel behind them

of the boat and onto the rocks He stops for a moment

looks back at the older teens

Ricky looks anxiously back towards the city

Across the water a burst of fire glows on North Head
Ricky frowns

They wheel around their backs to the sea

DARK SHAPES seem to melt out of the cliff and fan out
around Mr Jones and Rachel advancing slowly

Jones pushes Rachel behind him clumsily as they back
away He raises shaking gnarled fists

RACHEL (CONTD)
Can you stop them

MR JONES
Not for long

The central Wilberforce steps forward His skin glistens
with slime his crude features beginning to dissolve The
creature allows itself a cruel smile

Rachel looks around the rocks and grins

RACHEL
We don’t need long

Jones looks and then sweeps a wall of flame in front
of them The Wilberforces rear back shrieking

EXT RANGITOTO TRACK - NIGHT 166

Theo climbs panting with effort He stops gets his
bearings

The bush around him rustles and cracks He ducks low
looking around His stone throbs with a pulsing glow

The distant BARK of a Wilberforce then an answering
BARK from just metres away Theo freezes —

The dark shape of a Wilberforce looms in the moonlight
It SNIFFS deeply picking up his scentTheo cowers

and is suddenly YANKED violently from the ground sinewy
tendrils whipping around his body from behind

Theo flails — his stone FALLS — its light dims

CRUNCH Theo arrests his passage on the thin trunk of a
bush with one hand He scrambles for the stone with the
other The tentacle tightens around him

From around him more vicious BARKS sound DARK SHAPES
melt out of the darkness to surround him Barely seen
the Wilberforces have abandoned human form They writhe
with predatory power

Theo winces in pain as he reaches for the stone
reaches —

The Wilberforces close in —

Theo’s hand closes around the stone

Theo swings around and — BLAM — sends cords of fire
lashing out into the dark The tentacles around him whip
away The creatures shriek and bark tentacles flail
Theo scrambles to his feet He shoots forth another jet
clearing a path ahead of him and clambers on up the
mountain

made it if you’d stayed If you’d helped
them instead of saving yourself

painful

But I don’t get a choice — I’1l die

shudders

He’s here

Mr Jones shakes his head Rachel looks up —

A dark shape looms in the moonlight Mr Wilberforce

Mr Jones rises shakily to his feet between them He lifts
his hands Tiny licks of fire spark at his finger tips

Wilberforce regards the old man with disdain

Mr Jones holds out Rachel’s stone Fearful she meets his
gaze He nods

MR JONES
Take it

Wilberforce advances on them black eyes burning with
hatred

Rachel closes her fingers around the stone breathing
deeply She flinches

grits her teeth riding the pain SMOKE begins to hiss
from between her fingers a CRACKLING as her flesh

Mr Joness eyes blaze watching as Rachel shudders tears
streaming down her face her hand glowing white-hot
around the stone

Mr Jones clamps his own hands around hers wrapping them
in healing flame

Hold on for Theo

He releases her hands She trembles her fist shaking
around the burning stone

up the track towards the summit

determined then falters He falls to one knee fading
fast He looks up

MR JONES
If they have to die let them die
together

Wilberforce almost smiles

MR WILBERFORCE
I will make sure of it

He clamps his hand on Mr Jones’s face His hand sinks
into Jones’s flesh as the old man buckles

Rachel screams as the two cosmic forces meet —
Wilberforce seems to absorb Jones from the head down
the old man seems to incinerate from the inside out

A fire burns brightly then dies a wraith of ash
falling to the ground

Wilberforce looks to Rachel

She gasps backing away — her fist clenched at her chest
With a terrifyingly fast movement his arm lashes out —
over the five metres between them — and grabs her throat
with a tangle of tentacles

Rachel beats at the tendrils wrapping around her neck
with her closed fist as Wilberforce lifts her from the
ground by her throat She gags fighting for breath

Theo crests a rise to see the crater in front of him

Mr Wilberforce stands at the far end of the platform He
holds Rachel by her neck — his arm melding horribly with
her own flesh She hangs limply — the awful decay
spreading across her body

Theo gasps in horror He runs to the platform his stone
balled inside his fist Theo raises his hand

THEO
Put her down

Wilberforce looks up with contempt

Rachel’s eyes GLAZE OVER

The glow of FIRE flickers from Theo’s stone then
DIES Theo looks down at the stone incredulous he
shakes it nothing happens

Mr Wilberforce drops Rachel in a heap his arm a mass of
writhing tendrils Her eyes are glazed open her mouth
hanging limp

The sight hits Theo like a sledgehammer

THEO (CONT’D)
No

Mr Wilberforce smiles cruelly at Theo

A huge EARTHQUAKE rocks the mountain Theo is thrown to
the ground Wilberforce rides the tremor unperturbed

CRACKS ripple across the crater edge —

The viewing platform sags the planks rippling like piano
keys Rachel’s limp body slides towards the edge

From the beneath the ground the MASSIVE ROAR of the
gargantua sounds like some titan echo

see the Drones ringed behind him They advance

Theo holds up the lifeless stone ineffectually as the
Wilberforces close in on him

THEO (CONT’D)
No no

MR WILBERFORCE
Its sister dies How does it feel

And now finally Theo FEELS it all the loss of his
mother the loss of his sister

THEO

THEO (CONT’D)

Desperate now he calls again not out loud but WITH HIS
MIND

THEO (VO) (CONT’D)

ECU on Rachel’s EYES fixed on him She blinks —

A rush of WHISPERS — growing to a ROAR —

And in a furious flurry of images —

Their mother’s face their father feeding as babies
in a pen together toys teddy bears books a cat
a house spoon feeding drinking laughing crawling
walking running outside fishing horses swimming
school friends birthday cakes Christmas trees
milking a cow dinners laughter tears lost teeth
ice creams holidays pocket money beaches hide and
seek eye to eye the two connected through twin-ness —
WHISPERS form as if from out of the distance

RACHEL’S FINGERS uncurl slowly blistered flesh
cracking revealing her STONE It glows warmly now Her
fist closes around it

Mr Wilberforce looms over Theo

A fiery halo circles Theo’s hands spreads across his
body He looks up — the look of anguish from moments
before has been replaced by one of power stronger than
ever before

Wilberforce stops — taken aback as behind him FIRE
glows —

Rachel rises wrapped in a halo of rolling FLAME Her
eyes blaze with power Theo gets to his feet his eyes
burning with the same power

The Drones SQUEAL and shrink back

Mr Wilberforce’s skin blisters sloughs away to reveal a
writhing mess of worms that shrivel and twist His mass
contorts into tentacles limbs and claws fighting at the
fierce heat

Rachel steps up to meet Theo He holds out his hand As
she takes it her fire rolls to engulf him These two
human torches turn and face the crater AS ONE they reach
back and THROW their stones —

As the stones leave their hands they seem to draw the
fire out of the twins arcing high across the crater
leaving a burning trail of light The two points meet at
the apex —

A column of FIRE rockets DOWN into the crater

A wave of scorching heat ripples outwards Mr Wilberforce
falls to the ground a mess of flesh and fibre
disintegrating Behind them the Drones HOWL as they are
blown apart

CRACKS appear in the crater belching flame —

The ground shakes —

From below the gargantua ROARS in its death throes

From the point above the crater six fingers of flame arc
out —

The twins duck as the fiery trails roar overhead
shooting out across the harbour —
