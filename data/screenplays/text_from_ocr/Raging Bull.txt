WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA

THEN CUT TO
INT BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT JAKE LAMOTTA wearing a tux is shadow-boxing

We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
shadows At 42 hes overweight and out of shape but the
balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
bursts of light He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue

JAKE
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Its a thrill to be standing here
talking to you wonderful people In
fact its a thrill to be standing
I havent seen so many people since
my last fight at Madison Square
Garden After that fight a
reporter asked me Jake where do
you go from here I said To a
hospital I fought one hundred and
six professional fights and still
none of them bums figured out how
to fight me -- they kept hitting me
in the head And thats why Im
here tonight

(starts to sing)

When the fighters not engaged in
his employment his employment
although he was Champ and quite the
rage he must go somewhere else to
seek employment seek employment
But a fighters life is not a bowl
of cherries still Id rather have
an egg than a fist upon my face
Thats Entertainment

INT CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT Bam JIMMY REEVES a fast black middleweight jabs LAMOTTA
19 years old in the face JAKE staggers forward No matter
how hard LAMOTTA is hit no matter how often he always
staggers forward -- like a bull The bell sounds

Battered JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner

Its September 1941 Europe and Asia are already at war
Young SOLDIERS freshly recruited dot the hostile audience --
each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring

Suddenly words are exchanged a GIRL screams and a SOLDIER
and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging

AND IN THE RING JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits
blood into the bucket his younger brother JOEY holds for
him TONY his trainer works the cuts

JOEY
You didnt have to come to
Cleveland to get beat by a moulan
yan Jake

TONY
Hes got you Jake Youre
outpointed Youre coming up for
the tenth You gotta knock him out

The bell sounds for the tenth JAKE pulls himself up and
charges at REEVES

REEVES slides away jabbing punching piling up points
In JAKEs corner JOEY stands and yells at JAKE

JOEY
A grand apiece We got a grand
apiece on this Jake A fucking
grand

JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate wild
alley-fighting attack One ferocious punch after another
The SPECTATORS go wild everyones up for the kill
REEVES staggers then falls to the canvas
The REFEREE counts

REFEREE
One two three four

The GAMBLERS call out new odds ten to one for REEVES the
underdog JOEY excited sees that time is running out and
steps in front of the bell He swings his arms pretending
not to realize he literally holds back the TIMERs arm for a
few seconds This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but
not enough JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the
count of nine ending the match

Boos and cheers The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to
get their money

JAKE dances around the ring kissing his gloves and thrusting
them toward the CROWD JOEY rushes out and hugs him

The ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen the winner
under the rules of the Cleveland
Boxing Commission after ten
rounds by a decision -- Jimmy
Reeves

The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES arm as his corner tries to
lift him off the canvas -- still out cold TWO ATTENDANTS
bring in a stretcher

JAKE is stunned He still prances around now trying to
figure out what happened He raises his arms in victory and
the FANS go crazy cheering ripping chairs out fighting
with the COPS throwing bottles and junk into the ring
PEOPLE go into the ring

JOEY

(to Jake)
Dont get out of the ring You won
the fight -- let him go out first

CUT TO

REEVES being placed on the stretcher
A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to
play the Star Spangled Banner REEVES is carried out

Only then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring

SPARRING PARTNER

INT ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY (FEB 1943)

JAKE wearing pleated dress slacks sits on the edge of the
bed examining his muscle tone

He studies his small fists Squeezes each knuckle Twists his
wrists Clenches Unclenches

VICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and
panties

VICKIE
Are you sure we should be doing
this

JAKE

Come over here

VICKIE
You said never to touch you before
a fight

JAKE
(lovingly)

If you let me do it Ill murder

VICKIE
You said I couldnt Youve been
good for two weeks

JAKE
Come here

JAKE watches VICKIE approach him He respects her as he would
a shrine he slowly removes her sheer nightie

His round hands caress her smooth skin He glides his bruised
knuckles across her shoulders pride on his face

She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously then his bruised
face

JAKE (CONTD)
Take off my pants

VICKIE
Jake

JAKE
Do what I say

He touches her breasts as she removes his trousers

JAKE (CONTD)
Now take the rest off

VICKIE

get you excited
JAKE

She pulls off his shorts VICKIE is now getting excited She
kisses his chest and licks it

VICKIE

JAKE

She does

JAKE (CONTD)
Now touch me
(takes her hand)
here

VICKIE
Oh Jake

She caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his
erection

JAKEs lips are trembling He quickly turns his back on
VICKIE goes into the bathroom and gets a full glass of cold
water

VICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold
water She is shocked and surprised

JAKE
I cant do it I cant fool around
This Robinson I gotta beat him
again I cant fool around Dont
come near me

JAKE grabs her again and kisses her Then gently but firmly
he turns her around and pushes her out (Its starting again
and he must stop it) He goes back the bathroom and closes
the door

knocks him with a hard right then a series of rights and
lefts JAKE is punched all the way across the ring but stays
in there
THE SEVENTH ROUND JAKE coming on strong forces SUGAR RAY
into his own corner then lands a left hook to his chin
SUGAR RAY drops and takes a nine count This time however
the blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY

The old Garden is packed The EX-CHAMPS the PRESS the
OFFICIALS the MOB GUYS the FANS -- theyre all here

The FIGHTERS are announced BILLY FOX and JAKE touch gloves
and return to their corners

FOX is taller and has a longer reach than JAKE

The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS come out FOX goes to the
head JAKE goes to the body

FOX lands a solid blow to JAKEs jaw but LAMOTTA is unfazed
FOX is surprised In the past his opponents have gone down
when he connected

In the audience COMO SALVY and some other BOYS watch with
interest

JAKE moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows
All of a sudden FOX is wobbly JAKE goes for the head then
cuts his punch short FOX is about to go down

JAKE throws his arms around FOX to make sure he doesnt fall

JAKE
(to Fox)
Stand up What the fuck are you

doin

The REFEREE breaks them apart and FOX remounts his attack
JAKE bicycles into a corner and lets FOX work him over

FOX connects once twice three times JAKE barely defends
himself -- but he doesnt go down either

The CROWD starts to smell a fix There are calls from the
AUDIENCE
CROWD
Got your swimming trunks on Jake
I hope theyre paying you enough
Fake fake

TIME CUT

JAKEs corner JAKE is acting stunned TONY not aware of
whats going on is slapping JAKE

TONY

TIME CUT

The sign reads Round Four JAKE is in the center of the
ring taking a relentless pasting from FOX JAKEs arms hang
at waist level FOX lands one blow after another The stink
of a fix permeates the arena

JAKE is furious that FOX cant deck him He curses through
his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow)

JAKE
Hit me Hit me Whats the matter
with you you motherfucker Hit me

Boos and catcalls echo through the Garden This is not even a
fight The REFEREE realizing this steps in between FOX and
LAMOTTA waves his arms and signals that FOX is the winner by
a technical knockout

As he does JAKE spits his mouthpiece in disgust at FOX and
struts back to his corner

JAKE JOEY and TONY are already on their way out of the
arena as the REFEREE declares FOX the winner

COMO and the OTHERS satisfied get up to leave
INT JAKES DRESSING ROOM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

As a REPORTER and a PHOTOGRAPHER come through the door WE
SEE and hear a commotion in the hall behind them They rush
in look and stop by the door There is silence -- except
for JAKES uncontrollable sobbing The atmosphere is like
that of funeral

JAKE is seated behind the rubbing table He is still in his
leopard-skin robe His head hangs low as he sobs
The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture The HANDLER motions to him
to stop and then goes and sits near the door The REPORTER
still stands near the doorway seeming quite stunned by the
scene he is witnessing but nevertheless continuing to
scribble away on his pad

JOEY standing near JAKE has his back to everyone his
shoulders are shaking his lips are tightly drawn He cries
soundlessly TONY is pacing nearby

TONY
Dont fight anymore
(pause)
Its a free country dont fight
anymore

JAKE
(between sobs)
Why did they have to stop it Why
did they have to stop it

The REPORTER leans over to the HANDLER and whispers

REPORTER
What happened

HANDLER
(quietly)
He mustve been really hurt in the
2nd He didnt answer me when I
tried to tell him something in the
corner

JAKE still buried in his robe becomes aware of the hum of
voices and shouts out

JAKE
Get everyone out of here

The REPORTER and the PHOTOGRAPHER leave JAKE continues to
sob

Good evening ladies and gentlemen

hospital

About HALF THE PATRONS are listening of them HALF are
laughing SOME a little too loud

I fought one hundred and six
professional fights and none of
them bums figured out how to fight

head
(calls to the bar)
Will somebody at the bar -- Linda
- get me a drink I figure if Im

Thanks honey -- Shes terrific
The kinda girl you wanta take home
to meet your father Especially if
your old mans a degenerate --
Heres a toast To your health
You only live once But if you play
it right once is enough I
shouldnt be drinkin like this
cause Im tryin to lose weight
Im on this terrific diet -- Im
allowed to eat anything I want As
long as I dont swallow it Well I
never had much luck with my weight
In fact -- I never had much luck
with anything -- until about a few
years ago when this happened --

He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause
of which there is some

JAKE (CONTD)

thanks Im glad to see you
remember For those of you that
dont thats me takin the title
from Cerdan
You know the tough thing about
winnin the title the next thing
you gotta do is have a rematch
just to show it wasnt no fluke So
what happens Marcel Cerdan a
really great champ after I beat
him he gets himself killed in
that airplane crash a pretty
rotten break for him Thats why I
dont like to fly People say to
me Look Jake when your time is
up your time is up And I say
Yeah but suppose Im on the plane
and the pilots time is up As
good as Cerdan was I couldve

taken him again But I never got
the chance to prove it wasnt no
fluke He got killed but he got to
be what they call a legend I dont
know whats worse -- bein a fluke
or bein a legend -- Thats the
kinda luck I got Thats why I quit
the ring and moved down here from
New York My wife said You gotta
get outa this town Jake Come to
think of it the boxing
commission said the same thing But
I dont miss New York Give me
Miami any day

The AUDIENCE applauds

JAKE (CONTD)
Miamis a great place I get along
with everybody in this town even
the police force They got the
best cops here money can buy --
Only kiddin By the way me and
my wife Vickies gettin ready to
celibrate our eleventh wedding
anniversary

More applause

JAKE (CONTD)
We get along real great We fight a
little but I never really belted
her on purpose Once in a while
Im standin there doin little
shadow-boxin and she happens to
walk right into the shadow I
cant help that
She says Whataya hittin me for
I says Its nothin Its only a
love tap She says Its a good
thing youre not crazy about me --
I am crazy about her I heard her
talkin to a friend on the phone
and she was sayin After eleven
years Im still in love with the
same guy -- If I ever find out
who the bum is Ill kill him
Women You cant live with em you
cant live without em

Then suddenly falling into character he quotes
speech in Othello
JAKE (CONTD)
Oh beware my lord of jealousy
It is the green-eyed monster which
doth mock the meat it feeds on
That cuckold lives in bliss who
certain of his fate loves not his
woronger But O what damned
minutes tells he oer who dotes
yet doubts -- suspects yet fondly
loves -- Thats from somethin
called Othello --

OR ALTERNATE SPEECH

JAKE (CONTD)
Is whispering nothing Is leaning
cheek to cheek Is meeting noses
Kissing with inside lip Stopping
the career of laughter with a sign
-- A note infallible of breaking
honesty -- horsing foot on foot
Skulking in corners Wishing clocks
more swift Hours minutes Noon
midnight and all eyes blind with
the pin and web but theirs theirs
only that would unseen be wicked
Is this nothing Why then the
world and all thats int is
nothing The covering sky is
nothing Bohemia nothing My wife
is nothing nor nothing have these
nothings if this be nothing --
Thats from something called The
Winters Tale -- Shakespeare You
all remember Shakespeare
He wrote all them famous plays one
after the other then he went into
a big slump and he aint done
anything good in years That speech
is about jealousy -- jealousys a
bad thing Jealousy bothers a lot
of guys take me I almost
illed my brother I love him
hes my family I mean theres
nothin he wouldnt do for me And
thats the way we been goin thru
life -- doin nothin for each
other Anytime he got in trouble
when we was kids I got him out of
it You know he used to steal
little things when we was growin

up But he was particular only
stole things that begin with an
-- a watch a car a suit a
ring But I was wrong I
shoulda never hit my brother
Afterwards I was sorry Now every
time I need somethin I gotta go
shoppin for it A psychiatrist
once told me When you hit your
brother youre really hittin your
mother but you cant admit it to
yourself Hes really crazy I
woulda never hit my mother I mean
only in self-defense

JAKE (CONTD)
Why why why me You took it away
from me They took everything away
What do they want from me What the
fuck do they want from me I aint
bad I aint bad Im not that guy
Im not that guy Im not a
monster Im not an animal

JAKE breaks his knuckles the pain and blood are unbearable

JAKE collapses to the concrete floor His hands are smashed
He cries then sobs

JAKE (CONTD)
Im not like that Please Im not
like that Please Please Please

Then silence
We begin to hear JAKE doing a monologue
JAKE (CONTD)
And so as Shakespeare said Ive

been down so low theres nowhere
else to go
INT METROPOLE - NIGHT The Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square

JAKE LAMOTTA 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit
continues his monologue

JAKE
Except here gentlemen with you

exclusive now they got bouncers
outside to throw the drunks in My
first night here I said to the
boss Wheres the toilet -- He
said Youre in it By the way
this engagement is just a stepping
stone for me If I do good here

business

The CROWD starts to shout Get the fuck off the stage

JAKE (CONTD)
OK OK I know what youre waitin
for -- and from the looks of you
you been waitin for it for a long
time I had my own joint in Miami

Beach once it was too high-class
for you guys we had a 50-cent
minimum charge just to keep out the
viff-raff

The CROWD continues to shout as before also shouting
Bring out the girls

JAKE (CONTD)

JAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48s goes into her
dance He goes over to the bar and gets a drink SEVERAL
OLDER MEN in T-shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at
the bar

EXT METROPOLE - NIGHT

The Club is closing JAKE and EMMA the stripper come out
and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot

JAKE sees his brother JOEY enter the delicatessen

JAKE
Look sweetie be a good girl

EMMA

JAKE

JAKE goes to the parking lot entrance as EMMA gets into a
cab

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Its about twenty minutes later

DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot
He looks at the delicatessen

JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag Not noticing
JAKE he walks right past him to his car which is parked near
the rear of the outdoor lot

JAKE
Hey Joey --

JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched

JOEY looks at JAKE Silence JOEY turns his back and starts
to get into his car

JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder

JAKE (CONTD)
No Joey no Look wait a minute
please --

JOEY looks at JAKE like hes shit throws JAKEs hand off his
shoulder and starts to get into his car again

JAKE (CONTD)
Aw Joey --

JAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car He puts his hand
on JOEYs shoulder again

JAKE (CONTD)
Youre right Youre perfectly
right You got every right in the
world to hate my guts

JOEY pulls away from JAKEs hand and tries to put the paper
bag into the front seat of the car

JAKE (CONTD)
No please I know I was a
cocksucker Youre right I shoulda
never raised my hands to you

JOEY half pushes JAKE away and begins to get into his car
again

JAKE pulls JOEY by the arm

JAKE (CONTD)
No Joey listen to me --

JAKE pulls too hard causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to
his feet The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break
open and splatter JOEYs pants legs

JOEY stares down at his pants then up at JAKE Suddenly he
belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw JAKE is taken
by surprise and backs off to get his own hands up

JOEY keeps pouring it on JAKE drops his hands and takes it

JAKE (CONTD)

Go ahead

(gets punched)
Hit me again

(gets punched)
I deserve it

(gets punched)
Pay me back

(gets punched)
More
(gets punched)

JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE He cant figure
it out

JAKE nods and tries to smile but starts to cry instead

JAKE (CONTD)
More Go ahead Joey I deserve it

JOEY pauses then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKEs
shoulder

He leaves his hand there -- then uncurls his fist -- and
finally puts his hand around JAKEs neck as tears start to
fill his eyes

JOEY hugs JAKE close to him crying

They hug each other both crying They dont say anything
EXT BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT The theater lights are flashing

A shadow goes by the frame its a STAGEHAND

STAGEHAND (0S)
Hey Jake how you doing

The shadow exits

JAKE
How long do I have

The shadow pops in again

STAGEHAND (0S)
About five minutes
The shadow exits

JAKE
OK

JAKE pauses then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room
His breath comes in quick gasps His feet pop up and down
like they were on canvas His tiny fists jerk forward with

short bursts of light

Still alive Still a contender A 42-year-old man fighting
for his shot

The CAMERA DOLLIES into a FULL SHOT of his fists as they hit
the empty air -- in and out of the frame

This quote appears (Music in)
Verily verily I say unto thee

Except a man be born again
He can not enter into the kingdom of heaven

John 3-3
The CAMERA goes into DARKNESS

The END CREDITS roll up

THE END
