Black fade in a giant stage enormous with black cur-
tains--open The entire stage is filled with a wall of fire

200 feet high Within the fire are thousands of souls screaming
out silently only the roaring of the fire

FADE OUT

There is a dark land where mysteries and confusions abound where
fear and terror fly together in troubled cities of absurdities

Black clouds race by over a soot-covered city where it is dark-
est night Only a few tiny yellow squares of light in the old
buildings and factories Everything is so dark Very little
life is noticed except the tiny dark yellow squares There are
no cars seen from this high angle looking down over the city--no
people out this night

A closer look at some of the buildings reveals a thirties style
architecture although quite plain and very massive Office
buildings with heavy industrial factories A smoke stack pours
tons of heavy black smoke slowly and silently into the dark night
sky Hundreds of heavy electrical wires crisscross through

the sky and electricity hums come from giant boxes on the poles
The headlights and then a car--it moves slowly below down a
street then turns out of signt An old neon sign over a diner
says City Diner A large old hospital and the front steps
Inside a nurse goes by wheeling a patient on a rolling bed

The corridor is now empty Moving slowing through the empty
corridor An open steel door

Down now two flights of cement stairs and along a dark and moist
corridor off of which sit decaying subterranean hospital rooms
We hear the heavy machinery that keeps the massive building ope-
rating Pipes leak rusted festering water into puddles on the
cold floor

Entering one of these small decaying rooms we see an old hospital
bed A dim name tag on the end of the bed bears the name RONALD
DE ARTE

In the bed under the white sheets lays RONALD DE ARTE who
because of some strange unnamed happening is now here quite dis-
figured There is no human form to him really except he does

have arms and legs but theyre under the sheets The chest

and head area are very strangely shaped but there is a hole

for a mouth and a nose In the mouth there are teeth and a tongue
which moves There are two eyes above the nose hole The eyes
dart back and forth

Suddenly and quite mysteriously there is a detective now standing
in this room He wears black pants and shoes a white shirt

a black jacket which is now hanging on a rack over against the
cement wall Over his shirt he wears leather straps and a
shoulder holster which supports a 38 pistol under his arm

He is standing looking at the hospital bed Ronald De Arte

is now making some sounds--very high pitched whines and is
attempting to reach a piece of paper which lies on a moveable
steel tale next to his bed The Detective moves in closer and
hands the paper to Ronald who contorts in order to get his arm
over to it More high pitched whines and a knocking of his hand
on the table near a pencil which leaps with every hit lets the
Detective know that Ronald now requires a pencil with which to
write Ronald very shakily scribbles out the following symbols
and all the while he makes very long high pitched whines

O02 -
(SS

The Detective takes the paper to a small lamp across thd room
and looks the symbols over He folds the paper and continues

to hold it as he turns toward Ronald again He comes up closer
to Ronald Ronald makes some more noises The Detective now

is very close to Ronald looking into his eyes Very faintly

the big close up of Ronald stays double exposed as the Detective
turns gets his coat and goes quickly out of the room Putting
on his coat he looks suspiciously left and right down the dark-
corridor--no one--he goes down the hall and disappears around
the corner No one is on the street as he crosses it to a large
building where he stops and turns back to see if anyone is follow-

ing him He looks carefully all around him Satisfied with

the situation as it is he turns back again and goes down the
street into the darkness Ronalds CU fades

Now the Detective is in a train station Several people are
boarding a black steel train in a dimly lit passenger loading
area The Detective climbs aboard and finds a seat Even with
the lights on it is still so dimly lit The cigar and cigarette
smoke is very thick People talk but not too audibly because

the train and station sounds are so loud It is a dull crowd

of very poor working-class people The train begins to move

and rumbles through the night At the first station nearly every-
one lets off An arcing of electricity and on again to the next
station which appears to be the last because everyone gets off
except the Detective The people hurry through the underground
station than all is deserted The train continues to make sounds
but doesnt move A conductor appears and finds the Detective
still aboard

CONDUCTOR
(speaking loudly)
Off the train

DETECTIVE
I want to go deeper into the city Im
a detective

CONDUCTOR
You a detective

DETECTIVE
Yes

CONDUCTOR
Train doesnt go far into the city
can only go one maybe two more stations
Closed up beyond that no
one You want to go but only one maybe
two stations

DETECTIVE
Can I get another train to go further

CONDUCTOR
No more trains ever beyond here
never go now three people

(looks up with a now this is curious expression)

At this two strange looking people slowly enter the train car
from the other end and begin coming toward the Detective and
the Conductor

CONDUCTOR CONT
Board
The Conductor leaves the car and the other two sit down and look
at the Detective then at each other then down at the floor
then up at the Detective

Outside the Conductor yells something which echoes in the back-
ground then someone way far away yells The Conductor yells
again and the train begins to move very slowly ahead with much
grinding metal sounds Streaking along the train moves into
even heavier darkness Occasionally a light can be seen outside
the windows but mostly all is black The lights in the train
dim down lower as a humming sound comes from above the trains
The train slows and enters a station This station is empty

and very old It looks completely un-used Papers and dirt

are blown through-out windows are broken and most of the lights
are out The outside is suddenly lit up considerably by a huge
electrical arcing of the wiring on the train It stops and the
lights inside come up slightly The Conductor walks quickly
into the car and as he goes by the three of them

CONDUCTOR
Bad repair electrical sparks

Outside the electricity arcs again and the train jumps forward
It moves along slowly and the giant humming sound is now con-
tant The train goes through darkness then comes to an area
where there are some lightbulbs strung on wires and then the
train slows to a grinding halt The two across from the Detec-
tive leave the train as the Conductor walks in

CONDUCTOR
End of the line

DETECTIVE
Is this the station

CONDUCTOR
No one uses the station all thats
left We have train trouble now a

bad place Get off the train now
this is the end of the line From
here on youre on your own Bub

The Detective steps off the train and the train begins backing
up out of sight The Detective stands near a bulb Moths fly
against the bulb over and over again they hit at it try-
inz to get at the light The Detective watches the moths

There are noises the Detective turns He is surrounded by snarl-
ing black dogs circling him--moving closer The Detective freezes
with fear Now out of the darkness comes a group of men wearing
black woolen overcoats black hats gloves and boots They stamp
their feet up and down as they slowly surround and move in closer
to the Detective They join with the dogs and become like the
moths around the light bulb Suddenly like animals they attack
and quickly beat the Detective to the ground One of the men
zaps the Detective with a huge electrical jolt from an elect-
rical hand gun which is shaped like a cattle prod The Detective
doesnt move They continue to circle They zap him again

and the ground begins to smoke Now laughing they storm off

into the night with the dogs The Detective strains to open

his eyes and maintain consciousness

DETECTIVE (outloud to himself
What has happened to this place

Now out of the darkness comes an old man TERRY In fact one

of the two people that travelled on the train with the Detective
He is an older man--rather mean looking and wears one pant leg
rolled up exposing a gauze bandage He carries a fly swatter

with him and from time swats his sore leg at the bandage When
the sore is particularly acting up Terry turns the swatter around
and digs under the bandage with the wire handle

Now Terry circles the Detective slowly--eyeing him

TERRY
Get up Get up here outa the light

this confusion gets stronger as you get
close to him ie Hank Bartells which
youve got to do but you cant do so
if you did though you wouldnt even remem-
bear your own name see

DETECTIVE
If I lose consciousness I die

TERRY
Hey Its the same with everybody

picture forming on the old Litmus paper
(points to his head)

DETECTIVE
Not really Terry

TERRY

to study a map of the city) this
heres the inner city where Hank is

(he walks over next to Knitter 2 and

holds the top of her head)
You know whats inside here If
you had a power drill youd burn the
damn thing out before you drilled even
one half inch into this head This is
rock man solid rock Hell
yes its safe to talk here

Terry comes back to the map and the detective

TERRY (cont)
Whats on your mind

DETECTIVE
How do we get into the inner city and
find Hank Bartells and stop him

TERRY
Well the inner citys locked up
pretty tight like I told you but more
and more its well more people
is coming out of it a lotta the
electric trucks are coming out the
trucks pipe out the bad electricity

- see sos and like the donut

DETECTIVE

The donut men

TERRY
Yeah and those men with those
black coats you know the
ones that zap you so if they
are coming out theres got to be a way
in Bill knows one of the gates
he knows Hank supposedly Its
bad Ill tell ya One way though
is the dangerous way but its its
goin backwards

DETECTIVE

Backwards

TERRY
Yeah memory lane stuff scary
dangerous stuff

DETECTIVE

Whatya mean Memory Lane

TERRY
You know starting with his parents
and working our way back and some-
where back there is that gate to the
old inner city

DETECTIVE
Oh yeah oe

TERRY
Yeah So you think you can handle

this kinda job Boy-o

DETECTIVE
I can stand on one leg

TERRY
Bull

DETECTIVE
I can stand on one leg and give you the

Detectives Motto

TERRY
This I gotta see

The Detective stands up and then raises one foot so he can hold
it with one of his hands Across the room one of the knitters
looks over

KNITTER 1
My God look at that Hes standing
on one leg imagine

DETECTIVE

The detectives motto
Stay alert
Concentrate
Stay clean

TERRY (amazed)

People here cant hardly stand up anymore
let alone go for a period on one leg
believe me We do stand on one leg for

a moment when we walk As one foot swings

TERRY (contd)
forward on the stride the other remains
on the ground and for that moment we
are technically speaking on one foot
However we are in motion not station-
ary The balance is there but are we
sure Because in the next moment the
other foot will be on the ground to save
us from falling Its not the same thing
with you You can maintain balance for
possibly even minutes let alone seconds
and this is remarkable Its unbelievable
in this part of the city Or really
in any part of the city Of course Ive
seen people stand on one foot while hold-
ing on to something with their hands

MAIN CITY - NIGHT

Meanwhile at the hospital two men DR DAN PINK and DR BOB
PLATINUM sneak down to the hospital basement and look into each
room searching When they find Ronalds room they enter They
move toward Ronald and he starts a high scream They muffle

him with their gloved hands unhook his electrical apparatus
scoop him up and steal him away from the hospital

They carry Ronald in an old sedan through dark streets to an

old building They go to a service elevator and travel to one
of the top floors to a laboratory which the two of them maintain
It is equipped with black massive electrical appliances and
gadgets The walls are a yellow-green and all is lit by blue
glowing fluorescent lights giving the place a scientific eeri-
ness

They sit Ronald in a very special electrical chair which has
several tiers behind the back of the place Ronald sits Each
tier has new dials and cords and antennae and symbols
take a blood test and spin the blood in a special jar
his tongue and eyes
things to themselves as they work
something begins to smoke on one of the levels of the
chair and Ronald begins to bounce up and down
the fluorescent lights waiver

Suddenly

dering noise

small poof explosion and Ronalds head droops down

They throw levers

They
They check

turn dials and mumble
They work very quickly

There is a shud-

Quickly

Arte

finest projects

There is a knocking at the door The Doctors turn as the door
opens In comes DEBORAH very small very finely dressed and

heavily made-up woman
been expecting her

The doctors obviously know her and have

BOB AND DAN (in unison)

DEBORAH (excited)

by the arm then referring back to Bob)
Come Bobby

They exit after Bob struggles into his coat (His lining of
his coat was torn and his hand stuck in it)

Upstairs Deborahs apartment is extremely elegant She has

a big poodle dog and big vases of flowers The poodle spends
the entire time laying on its back under the dinner table pant-
ng Deborah has an older women in a uniform serving the dinner
e dish this evening is a strange looking vegetable with clusters
f leaves on it They begin eating by breaking the leaves off
nd floating them in a bowl of water which sits in front of them
ith special spoons they spoon in small round balls which dis-
olve and make the water thicker They then cut off parts of

e remaining vegetable and dip it into the thickened water bowl
nd eat it It has a spicy hot taste and they all breathe funny
fter eating each mouth full

oo tn SM OHFE-

The conversation during dinner is dominated by Deborah and the
older uniformed lady listens to all of it from behind the kitchen
door

DEBORAH
» A little tickle you know where

neck

The poodle continues panting under the table

DEBORAH (contd)
This is done over and over and
now I breathe all around this is
why I am breathing because it
makes a softness the hair stands
and the skin gets funny you know
» The whole thing is so pretty like

Behind the kitchen door the uniformed lady presses herself harder
to the door to hear better

DEBORAH (contd)
The rubbing is something that I do because

times my little fingers rub rub rub
so softly so tenderly Bobby

BOB

But he stayed last night

DEBORAH
You will stay tomorrow night Sweet
I promise

Downstairs Ronald sits in his chair in the laboratory He looks
lonely in this strange green room many electrical sounds humming
Moving closer to Ronald De Arte at night in the labora-

tory His eyes confused staring

BACK IN THE DEEP CITY
Terry is still talking The Detective is still standing on one
leg The knitters are knitting

TERRY
there have been stories of people
standing on their hands but both of their
hands never only one Theres
a man around the corner who supports
himself on one hand and one leg
maybe youll see him when we go get some-
thing to eat because hes usually out
front of the diner I knew a man once
who could get out of bed without using
his hands but then hed usually fall
over or get sick ya know Nowadays with
Hank reversing the electricity most people
like to sit down or lie down A lot

of people have diseases now you
now diseases physical
disorders Even if they are feelin

good sometimes after the trucks come
around they act funny from then on
In other words they get permanently

changed you know but you bein
able to stand on one foot is damned near
unbelievable damn good

MAIN CITY - BOB AND DANS LABORATORY - DAY

It is foggy outside the Lab windows Distant factory sounds
are heard

e doctors have opened Ronald up and are putting electrical
omponents inside of him After closing him they leave a tube
rough the skin onto which they hook an electrical device that
onald will always have to wear on his chest Out of the device
omes another tube and at the end of it there is a rubber bag
nd a small needle which is again inserted back into Ronalds

in and taped over with adhesive tape

onvawDtan

ey use electricity in several foreign manners to carve Ronalds
ace and graft on new features Unfortunately these doctors
rent the artist they think they are Their hearts are in the
ight place and they have tremendous energy but the results

re far and away from handsome The doctors are very serious

ile they work They concentrate very hard and their faces
ontort in funny ways Its now break time and Bob is bringing
e malteds over to where Dan is by Ronald As they drink their
malteds they discuss their work

taeeMR MH

BOB
What are you thinking

DAN
Im thinking that the ears will have
to be really done well this time Bob

BOB (sensing something)
I agree with that

DAN (carefully)
Theyre complicated And always before
we seem to hurry through the ears

BOB
You want to divide up the work as usual
Ill take the ears and you do the nose
or something

DAN (going around the bush)
Maybe (he reaches over slowly and
turns a dial and Ronald moves some and
opens his mouth Inside the mouth the
tongue starts flapping He turns the
dial down some) That mouth is going
to be a problem

BOB
Well do you want to talk it through
Shall we start on it

DAN
Theres something else that we havent
thought about Bob And that is hair

BOB
I was going to say yes I know
hair that is something to think about

DAN
Hair (he downs the rest of his
malted and stands up pauses--moves close
to Ronald) Id like to do the ears
Bob

BOB
Youve been leading up to this I knew
it I know they werent quite right

last time You want the ears Well

I want the ears too (he stands up)

I grafted them high last time but
this isnt the point Im the ear spec-
jalist youve got no right taking
the ears Youve only done one ear

I want the ears (hes trembling) Youve
been trying to think of a way to get

the ears I know you Youve been lying
awake nights thinking of how you could
manipulate me into giving you the ears

» and on THIS project Ive seen

you planning I knew you were trying
to get them from me I knew it

Bob strikes cut and smashes Dan in the face A short fist fight
follows and then

DAN
All right You keep the damn ears
BOB
(bleeding and panting)
No You take the ears Its not

worth it Ill work on something else
Maybe the hair or something

DAN

(panting)
No Im sorry Bob Well both
work on everything That way itll be
perfect You take an ear and Ill take
an ear We just have to keep good mea-
surements WEVE GOT TO KEEP GOOD
MEASUREMENTS (He buckles over and
slams his fist into his hand for emphasis

The laboratory is now lit for precision work and the chart of
The Average Handsome Man has been moved in closer to the
doctors work area They are each working an Ronalds head
The process involves a light foam over the skin and electrical
instruments hooked here and there Small electrical tools are
used by the doctors to reform Ronalds skin The foam hides
most of the work Dan is now putting the nose into place

Bob is assisting Dan lifts the nose off the table (where he
has been fashioning it) The area for the nose has now been
cleared Dan is just starting to place the nose

BOB
That looks good

DAN
If I can place it now lets have the
opening

BOB

All right (He pulls some skin apart)

DAN
(placing the nose)

DEBORAH
Here let me wipe your hand and face
Sweet (she begins to wipe Bobs face
with a damp cloth she has been carrying
She wipes his face over and over again
and then she cleans his hands carefully)

BOB
I guess I better go wake Dan

DEBORAH
All right my Sweet Cabini fly
away Remember to try and sit up
straight Youre getting round shoulder-
ed (she curves her hands over his
shoulders) Take these sweets for you

gets some very fancy large candies and
gives them to Bob He has to hold them
with both hands)

BOB

DEBORAH
Goodbye for now Sweet

BOB
Goodbye maybe I should have cleaned
my hands better these candies
DEBORAH
Theyre fine Bobby Your hands are
clean Now go wake up Dan Goodbye

BOB
(calling back as he goes downstairs)
Goodbye Ill clean them again anyway
soon for work were putting on the
ears today

Its hard for Bob to open the door to the laboratory while his
hands are full of candies but he finally manages

Meanwhile Dan hears Bob coming in however hes in a tickleish
spot and has to hold several things in place including a cord
in his mouth He cant hide the fact that hes been working

on Ronald without Bob

Bob enters and sees Dan At first he smiles then he sees the
ears

DAN
Now you wait just a damn minute tI
cant figure out how these ears got on

here

In a rage Bob flies across the room He wads the candies in
his fists and he hits Dan over and over again

DAN
I cant figure it

Later the two of them are working very silently Both are beaten
looking Dan has mussed candies stuck in his hair As he rubs
his eyes

DAN
What was that My eyes are still burning
BOB

Your eyes deserved to be burned

Suddenly Bob moves a lot of the foam away with an air instrument
and forgetting his anger yells out

BOB
Dan look Hes looking good

They push more foam away to get a look Theyre both excited

All the features on Ronald are well formed but they do not work
well together One ear is quite a bit larger than the other
And there is no hair at all Several areas are not yet healed
either

DAN
» weve got the touch Bob Weve
got the touch Lets come up to 15000
on the device Maybe we can speed that
healing up

BOB
Thats a good idea (turns some dials)

DAN
All the fluid there is just left over
you know

BOB
I know

Bob crouches down and surveys the ears on Ronald
BOB

The ears may be slightly off (he
looks at Dan Dan dives him a look back)

Bob removes more foam revealing the new Ronnie

BOB
I mean what can you say Look at the
quality the workmanship
Theey slap each other on the bank
DAN
Im a little worried about the
hair
BOB
Hes got to have hair
DAN

Well weve got to do it then What

BOB
Weve got a bunch of brown ones left

DAN
All right by God lets use them

LATER The top of Ronalds scalp Dan and Bob have put in
several hairs The hairs are long and wirey and they have many
more to place before Ronald will even begin to look like he has
hair He looks quite strange now with these few wirey hairs
sticking out

BOB
You keep going Im going to get us
a malted This hair is getting to me

DAN
All right me too

Bob goes over and scrubs his hands and gets going on a couple
of malted milks Dan remains sticking in more hairs--one at

a time Bob brings the malted milks over and Dan stops working
and takes a drink

BOB
My hands came clean
DAN
They look clean Im going to suggest

DAN

BOB

He has on his new red wig of high wavy pompadore style hair

DAN

DEBORAH
It is perfect Sweets Is he finished

DAN
Almost but we have to start him You

BOB
All set

DAN
Pull three light

DEBORAH

Oh

Bob and Dan each have several controls They begin turning dials
and pulling levers The chair begins to vibrate some and Ronald
begins to come to but very slowly From time to time he opens
his mouth and emits strange sounds and also from time to time

he blacks out altogether Even when hes out he twitches and
bounces When he begins to fade Bob and Dad pour on the juice
and the lights dim way down and there is an eerie glow Deborah
looks beautiful in the glow as she watches the spectacle Slowly
Ronald begins to come to again He looks very awake and his

eyes roll about He begins to move and he begins to scream

He starts to stand as he screams and vibrates violently when

all the lights blow out POW All at once Ronald falls

back in his chair and is still however he looks awake now

The moonlight is illuminating the room slightly

DAN
Scapels

BOB
(looking down out the window)
I think we blew out the whole building

Ronald moans and his eyes start rolling

DAN
I hope hes all right

DEBORAH
How will you fix the electricity

DAN
Theyll be on it soon but last time
it took hours Im afraid this is it
for a while
Ronald stops moaning and looks peaceful

DEBORAH
He looks peaceful now in the dark-
ness Is he all right honeys

DAN
I think hes all right we brought
him around

A CU of Ronald reveals open eyes and a dazed peaceful look

Bob Dan and Deborah move to a window and look out on the city
Deborah turns to Bob and then to Dan She gives Dan a slow tender
kiss on the lips and then she gives Bob the same The three

of them stand close together looking out the window Ronald

sits looking around the room still tied to many wires and sitting
low in the chair

Some clouds go by slowly and Bob and Dan and Deborah hugging
now watch the city and the sky

Suddenly the power comes back on Ronald screams bloody murder
and is shot out of his chair twenty feet through the air The
wires stuck to him keep him from going any further The lights
in the room blink on and off and the equipment goes crazy with
sounds and sparks Dan and Bob rush to turn things off

BOB
What happened

DAN
You forgot to turn the damn machines
off thats what happened

BOB
I forgot

DAN
Well what does it look like

DEBORAH
Sweets stop

BOB
I forgot What about you

Bob shoves Dan and he trips over Ronalds wires Bob hits Dan
hard in the nose The fight goes on all around Ronald who is
also on the floor In and amongst the wires Dan and Bob beat
each other while Deborah is screaming for them to stop Ronald
sits up the lights flutter several times dim and then

go out This stops the fight and all is dark and quiet except
for heavy breathing

DAN
There must have been 10000 volts through
him

BOB
I think we may have some trouble there

DEBORAH
Youre bad youre bad bad bad

DAN
Did you see him fly across the room
Like a rocket

Sounds come up slowly

BOB
Ronnie the Rocket

DEBORAH
Ronnie Rocket

Up close on Ronald In the moonlight laboratory he says

The other three turn to him in amazement

INT Bob and Dans Laboratory - Day

Ronnie is now fitted with a small black suit with a nice white
shirt Bob and Dan now have the shirt open and they are in the
last stages of fitting Ronnie with his electrical chest appli-
ance This is a life sustaining device which Ronnie will have
to wear continually It fits to his chest with little shoulder
straps and one strap which goes around his torso A series of
electrical wires come off this device and go surgically into
Ronnies body One fat cord comes out of the appliance and it
ends ina plug

DAN
Dont tighten that strap too tight Bob

BOB
Im not

DAN
See Ronnie See the plug You
have to learn to plug yourself in every
fifteen minutes When you hear the
little warning signal otherwise

otherwise you will feel funny
RONNIE

on the floor at one end of the lab This is planned as a learning
device in order to teach Ronnie to walk

it on the next painted footstep
See Watch me walk then you do
it OK Watch me first

Ronnie watching Bob as he picks one foot up very high and carries
it to the next painted footstep Ronnie watches this strange
walking then he mimics it perfectly The only problem is Ronnie
doesnt ever smooth out his walk He learns the high step
and the high step is what he does from then on

BOB
No Ronnie you dont have to lift your
feet so high I was just doing that
in order to very carefully show you the
various phases of walking Now
you can stop this high step which I showed
you and walk NORMALLY walk NORMALLY

RONNIE

MALLY

BOB
Yes Now lets walk around NORMALLY

They begin walking again but Ronnie maintains this very meticu-
lous high long stride Dan enters the lab carrying a box of
electrical apparatus

Even though he sees this strange sight of Bob and Ronnie he
smiles proudly their son is walking

ment
DEBORAH

DEBORAH

Come Ronnie let me show you around

Deborah takes Ronnies hand and begins to lead him but her poodle
dog stands up and begins to growl Ronnie makes a small noise
and leaps back He shakes with fear

DEBORAH
I think hes afraid of the dog
I will have it removed I will have

it removed Ronnie

Slowly so that Ronnie can see everything the three of them take
him through the living room and dining room His little eyes
darting here and there In the kitchen Ronnie high steps around
looking at all the different shapes and textures He spots the
toaster He goes to it and looks at his reflection in the shiny
metal

BOB
Its a toaster look

He puts a piece of bread into the toaster and pushes the toaster
on As the toaster heats up a strange electrical disturbance
starts in Ronnies chest and soon he is emitting through his
mouth a high pitched electrical scream The toast blows out
of the toaster scorched black and burning Deborah screams
Smoke begins filling the room Bob and Dan rush Ronnie into
the living room His little eyes are rolled back Bob and Dan
begin looking at various components of the chest-appliances

DAN
Its the RZ factor again

BOB
I think he really got too much the other
night

DAN
Yeah what can we do Maybe we

should run him through again

BOB
Hell The work

DAN
Yeah but the shieldings all gone to

DEBORAH (worried)
Will he be all right

DAN
Sure he will we just have to keep
an eye on him (Dan looks around)

turn something else on turn the
radio on

Deborah goes over to a big floor model radio and turns it on

She turns the dial trying to find a station She passes a station
where a woman is singing a song Ronnie almost leaps to the
radio

DEBORAH
Do you like that Do you like
that song

She tunes in the music A beautiful melody is being sung by

a women with a high clear voice Dan stands Ronnie by the radio
There is a slight static sound He adjusts a dial on the chest
appliance The static disappears and he stands back away from
Ronnie Ronnie suddenly opens his mouth and begins to mimic

the womans voice on the radio He actually sings some very
beautiful notes Deborah looks amazed and she happily turns

to Bob and Dan who also begin to smile

BOB
What a voice

DEBORAH
A singer

Suddenly though the electricity goes funny again Ronnies voice
causes tremendous static to build The electrical complication
causes a wild distortion in the womans voice and before Dan

or Bob can get to Ronnie the radio speaker is blown out with

an explosion The radio having been destroyed sits smoking
silently Ronnie begins to cry Deborah is horrified and rushes
to his side joining Bob and Dan

DEBORAH
Its all right Ronnie What can

DAN (worried)
Well shield him good so unless hes
near lots of power hell be OK

HALLS DAY

wire reinforced glass so

Ronnie is seated in a desk
An extension

Dan and Deborah have been allowed to watch but

They can just

RECEPTIONIST (to Ronnie)
This is not a party this is not a rowdy
night on the town This is a TEST This is a
three part test multiple choice true or
false and essay I will be watching you young
man so no funny business You have one half
hour I might add that this test has been
devised by Dr Herbert Smythe of Freeport Univer-
sity

RONNIE
Funny business

The stern Receptionist turns and leaves the room but she remains for
awhile at the glass until she sees Ronnie start filling in squares on the
multiple choice part of the test

DAN (quietly to Deborah and Bob)
I told him just color in the blocks where he
wanted to well leave it up to fate

BOB
I told him too Deborah

SUDDENLY Ronnie starts flipping pennies and going crouching down looking
then going back and marking his paper Deborah looks at Bob and Dan

DAN (to Deborah)
Hes on the true or false section now

Just then the Receptionist appears again She is shocked by what she sees
Roonie doing She enters the testing room in a rage

RECEPTIONIST
All right young man What is the meaning
of this Dont think youll put on over on me
» or Dr Smythe You cannot fool Dr Smythe

The bell rings Ronnies head flies back and the Receptionist grabs
the test from him and marches off Bob Dan and Deborah look worried

Later in the prinicpals office they all wait as the Receptionist
brings in the results of the entrance exam

Murodugh looks at the exam and then at Ronnie

MR MURDCUGH
You like mathematics

MR MURDOUGH (contd)
Are you interested in mathematics

speaks to the rest) He shows a definite
gift in higher mathematics quite a
gift The rest of the exam is mediocre
but as far as Im concerned he is
eligible for our school

Bob Dan and Deborah share an incredulous look

MR MURDOUGH (contd)
Hes a puzzling bcy Does he have
brothers and sisters

DAN
No hes an only child

MR MURDOUGH
I see an only child huh Ronnie

Ronnie says nothing

MR MUROCUGH (contd)
(looking at Ronnie)

Hes got the blemishes they all seem
to get at this age (he chuckles over
this and tries to get them to chuckle
along) I had the blemishes bad when
I was a youngster Coal cities is where
I grew up The black coal dust clouds
would blow all day and all into the
night it got the coal dust in my teeth
and hair and all in the pores of my
skin All the kids had it bad Its

MR MURDOUGH (contd)

matician is he (all nod up and down)
Ronnie Rocket

RONNIE

MR MURDOUGH
Yes well you can start school on Monday
Ronnie

At this Ronnies warning signal starts up on his chest appliance
and he gets a queer expression on his face He bends over

slowly and walks to an outlet and plugs himself in The principal
watches this Ronnies face is forlorn a far away look in

his eyes Deborah Dan and Bob all look at Ronnie and then

at each other and Mr Murdough then back to Ronnie who has

found several dead flies by the window He is gathering them
together in his hand

Terry and the Detective go along a filthy city street walking
People going by wear a glazed dazed totally spaced out look

TERRY
Things have gotten bad here I
can tell you these people are

in bad shape

In a pastry shop across the street two shop owners stand behind
the counter A man stands in the middle of the square store
and looks at the pastries

MAN
Well I guess Ill get some of them

The clerk is about to get the pastry for the man

MAN (contd)
No I changed my mind Ill take
some of them

The clerk moves to the new pastry

MAN (contd)
No Ill get some of them

The clerk moves again The man looks up at the ceiling

MAN (contd)
How much ya want for the light up there

EXT STREET DEEP IN CITY - DARK CLOUDY DAY
Terry and the Detective continue walking toward the diner
The Detective stops to look at a man balancing on one hand and
one foot

TERRY

Hey lets go in the diner get
something to eat Hey (sees
the Detective looking at the man balanc-
ing) Thats the guy I was telling

you about (goes to the man balanc-
ing) He (referring to Detective) can
stand on one foot

At this the man incapable of receiving such shattering informa-
tion cries out in agony

TERRY (contd)
(to Detective)
Come on

They enter the diner and sit at the counter The place is fairly
full mostly vacant eyes low class people eating dull looking
food The counter has now become crowded as more people come

in to the diner It is steamy and hot inside The grill is
sizzling The coffee machine is steaming The man next to

the Detective on his left is having a large bowl of soup

TERRY
(to waitress)
Gimme some bacon and eggs will ya and
a cuppa coffee (turning now to Detective
- smiles slyly) Do you know the symbolic
meaning of an egg

DETECTIVE
Terry (He frowns at Terry but
the waitress is waiting) Cheese sandwich

and a cuppa coffee

Coffees are brought immediately As he drinks his coffee the
Detective watches the people eating he watches the food
being prepared Everything here at least seems to be fairly
normal Terrys bacon and eggs arrive and he begins eating
hungrrily The knitters have followed the Detective and Terry

to the diner They and some of their friends stand around
outside talking about the Detective If only I was younger
» laugh laugh and he can stand on one foot

Inside the diner the Detective watches the man to his left slurp-
ing his hot soup Now the Detectives sandwich is being pre-
pared He sees the cheese being placed on the white bread and

mayonnaise being spread on the top piece of bread The sandwich
is put together and sliced in half with a big kitchen knife

On a plate it goes and the waitress sets it down in front of

the Detective He picks up one half and takes a big bite

He chews

TERRY
Hows the sandwich
DETECTIVE
Pretty good
TERRY
Yeah you like that cheese huh
DETECTIVE
Yeah
TERRY

Cheese is made from milk

Outside on the street suddenly people are running and
acting crazy Slobbering unable to stand spinning
falling walking into posts or walls dogs whimper and press

themselves to the pavement The knitters begin to walk back-
wards A massive black truck with an enormous antennae is round-
ing the corner The antennae issues forth tremendous electrical
sparks and there is a loud humming and buzzing in the air

People are getting very confused

Inside the Diner

TERRY
AOH OH hold on buddy Here
comes the truck I was teelinguablaotingki

The electricity gets very loud Suddenly the diner goes crazy
The man to the left of the Detective immediately puts his elbows
in his soup The Detective is suddenly off his stool with his
chin pressed into the center of his cheese sandwich on the
counter Terrys hand wants to go down Terrys throat and Terrys
teeth want to bite his hand The waitress must be standing

on her head because only her legs and feet rise up above the
counter Each person in the diner is having his own personal
seizure from bloody noses to head pounding to tongue swallowing
The Detectives eyes are rolling and his chin is flattening

his cheese sandwich to the thickness of fine paper

The door to the diner flies open and in comes a large fat man
with a wild smiling face His eyes bug out with each smile
In his arms he holds a box of powdered sugar donuts In his
hand is a nice donut which he eats all at once As he chews
he happen surveys the pandemonium

Behind him a large gang of black coated men pour crazily into
the diner They begin zapping people with electricity

The Donut Man goes over to the Detective and leans down--looking
him in the eyes The Detective tries to focus on the Donut

Man

The Donut Man holds up a donut right in front of the Detectives
face

DONUT MAN
Life is a donut

The Donut Man laughs uproariously

Outside in the streets there are fires burning and electrical
sparks in the air Men women and children and animals are
running wild Some are on fire

Inside the diner a black coated man wades through a pile of
bodies and stands in front of the man eating the soup The
black coat zaps the soup man and the soup mans arm flies back
hitting the Detective in the eye

DETECTIVE
Owww

The Black coat moves quickly to zap some more people The Detec-
tives eye is watering and puffing up but he sees a strange
sight across the diner Someone yells at the donut man that

the donut mans shoes are untied The donut man does not have

a normal reaction to this He screams bloody murder and runs
wildly out of the diner Just then a black coat turns and zaps
the Detective right in the head with an electrical cattle prod
gun The Detective flips off his chair and lands next to Terry
on the floor The black coats leave as quickly as arrived

TERRY

Organ playing - very faint very scratchy She starts to sway

with the music--her head her shoulders She looks to the
Detective He is swinging too She stands up and bares her
breasts to the Detective

CELIA

The father is mounting the stairs He comes down the hall and
listens at his daughters door

Inside the Detective is kissing Celia who has now removed her

The Detective tries once more to kiss Celia but she stops him

CELIA

The Detective is now holding her up as she is leaning way over

He starts feeling her breasts with his right hand while he holds

She hurries the Detective up the back stairs As he climbs the
stairs he can still hear the father yelling and Celia yelling
back

CELIA

The Detective enters a small room A nurse stands next to a
bed where an old man lies The nurse turns and studies the Detec-
tive

DETECTIVE
She said youd let me out the back door

NURSE (very calmly)
Youll have to get a saw and some lumber
and make one then because there sure

DETECTIVE (looking around frantically)

Oh yeah
OLD MAN

She shows the Detective one of her breasts

DETECTIVE (as he studies it)
» but IT really have to go
really

NURSE
All right then

She puts her breast away

OLD MAN
Hey let me see let me see
» Oh my God

The Detective crawls out the window and looks around He sees
another building within jumping distance He hurries across
the roof and leaps to a small balcony of the neighboring build-
ing He crosses the balcony and goes through a very dark room
to an interior hallway high in the old building Suddenly a
policeman appears climbing a staircase The policeman grabs
the Detective and pulls him along the corridor

POLICEMAN
Almost you almost got away
but how would he like to remember this

The policeman shoves the Detectives head into a room where a
small boy is hit in the back of the head with a rock

POLICEMAN
Or this

He shoves the Detective into another room where a bird with a
broken neck is doing backward sommersaults

POLICEMAN
Or this
He shows the Detective the next room In it he sees a stairway
as if coming down from above Slowly someone is descending the
stairs but all he sees are the feet coming down--closer

frightenly close

POLICEMAN
Or this

He shows the Detective the next room In it the Detective can
see the shape of a woman He looks closer He sees two breasts
as screams are heard echoing horribly in the distance

Suddenly there is a spark shooting out of a wall socket in the
corridor The Detective notices then looks up The policeman

is gone Then above the Detective hears a loud screeching sound
as the light is drained from the overhead bulb The Detective
moves slowly to the end of the corridor and starts climbing some
stairs

He climbs higher and higher Each flight of stairs looks the
same Finally he stops to rest Just as he does he hears
something A moaning distant wind Then suddenly some music
Reminds me of you A door opens above and a beautiful girl
appears The Detective cautiously goes to her

GIRL
Hello
DETECTIVE
Hello
GIRL

DETECTIVE
Im a Detective Who are

GIRL

DETECTIVE

DIANA
Do you want to come in

DETECTIVE
Yes sure if its all right

DIANA
Come in

She takes the Detective inside He sits in an easy chair while
she sits at her make-up table and starts getting ready to go
out

Suddenly the wall begins to shake very quietly It begins
to strain the light on Dianas make-up table strains and dims

the light explodes as two sections of the wall blow out

» electric wires bend into the room and begin to jump and
flip like hissing snakes shooting out electrical sparks The
room darkens to a haunting feeling Diana rubs a long line of
lipstick up her face-up her nose eye forehead and into her
hair before she flips backwards out of her chair onto the floor
next to the Detectives chair The Detective is pushing a pin
cushion into his neck and blood is forming in little dots Both
their eyes are wild The Detective strains and pushes a knitting
needle into Dianas leg Her eyes focus on she reaches out for
him The electrical violence reaches a fever pitch then begins
to subside The ceiling light glows a bit brighter Diana and
the Detective slowly come out of their fits and find they are
looking into each others eyes As she looks dreamily at the
Detective

DIANA
You put a knitting needle into my leg
They kiss

DETECTIVE

Yes

DETECTIVE
When I kissed you I saw fire (we

now see what he talks about--a wall of
fire) and I saw that three of my fingers
were on fire (we see three burning
fingers) and I saw three explosions of
light in the sky and streamers falling
down (we see this) and I saw three people
who couldnt walk (we see them)

DIANA
You did

Suddenly a friendly large woman THE AUNT enters hurriedly

THE AUNT

DIANA (with her very messy face
she turns to the Detective)
Would you take me to the dance tonight

DETECTIVE
Yes absolutely yes

DIANA
Do you think its safe

DETECTIVE
I have a feeling we can do anything
as long as were together
Outside Bill is standing in some bushes looking up at Dianas
house

The Detective and Diana walk arm in arm down the sidewalk along
with Dianas uncles and aunts and friends--a group of at least
fifteen very dashingly and beautifully dressed people They
arrive at a striking entrance to the circle club It isa
gigantic white neon circle glowing against the black night sky
Underneath it is a smaller glowing circle and passing through
it one enters the circle club The Detective and Diana look
up at the big circle The Detective is struck by the power of
the image and tries to figure something out inside his head

He shrugs off the thoughts and happily enters the club with all
the others

Inside the night club which is very elegant in a 30s sort of
way a maitre d seats the large party at a big round table near
the center of the vast room The place is crowded with fancy
People The Detective and Diana are so in love I think weve
discovered a pair of love birds dont you someone says I
think they make a darling couple Its a perfect match

INT DEBORAHS APT - NIGHT

This is a cozy setting Bob Dan Deborah and Ronnie are all
sitting happily together in Deborahs livingroom

DEBORAH
Ronnie you are such a love and
how hard you study on your homework

Ronnies page however is blank except for tiny scribbles of
the symbols he showed the Detective in the hospital We move
into a CU of Ronnie

INT NIGHT CLUB - DEEP CITY - NIGHT
DETECTIVE

Im wild about love

DIANA
Me Too

DETECTIVE
How can life be so dreamy

DIANA
I know
Drinks are served--large bottles of champagne All sorts of
little hors doeuvres are brought out The party is getting
happier and happier An old gentleman proposes a toast

OLD GENTLEMAN
to love

Everyone to love They drink The Detective asks Diana if

she would like to dance The music is by a large orchestra play-
ing a 30s style waltz Very beautiful The Detective and the
girl hold each other tightly as they sway to the music

A large group of people enter the Club They are all smiling
as they look around at all the other happy smiling people

MAN IN CROWD (smiling)
Gee this is a happy place

As they dance the Detective notices that the light coming from
one of the table lamps is decreasing in intensity He holds
Diana tighter He tries not to think about it but it worries
him

At the table the old Gentleman who gave the toast is reminiscing
A few people are half listening to him as they watch the dancing

OLD GENTLEMEN (smiling in his reverie)

I had a girl like her once I was
in love her lips were red like
this ones are her eyes were bright

I wanted to touch her and kiss her all
the time My love was so intense

No one could love that way so
strongly

The Detective looks over to the bad lamp It is now flickering

and getting darker He hears the light being sucked out of it

It goes out The Detective looks quickly around All the other
lights are still going

Back at the table the talk of the old gentleman changes

OLD GENTLEMAN

However in this world love like
that doesnt last it withers like
the vine it vanishes like the snow
It drys up like the leaves it
changes
The Detective notices another light flickering and another

A low ominous wind comes now along with the beautiful music
The old Gentleman is now getting a bit upset with his memory
of love There is some growing anger and tension at the table

OLD GENTLEMEN
The love almost rots it
becomes rancid sour foul smelling
it putriefies the atmosphere

It degenerates into loathing I
hated that girl let me tell you
she was a whore of the first order
a filthy whore unclean

The Detective sees six more small lights flickering They screech
as they go out Others begin to notice Theres a growing
uneasiness in the room

At the table the old gentleman is enraged with his memory He
is almost foaming at the mouth with hatred and anger

OLD GENTLEMEN

I despised everything she ever
thought or said or did She was
like a plague festering and bubbling
coughing up foul horror and sickness
the kind that makes a man plead to die

just to end the trial just to

be left alone to be rid of every-
thing longing for unconsciousness

The Detective is dancing very close with Diana His eyes are
closed He opens them and moves to look into her eyes They
are in love but there is trouble in this circle club She sees

him looking about worrying

DIANA
What is it
DETECTIVE
I dont know somethings wrong
here
He suddenly sees Bill entering
DETECTIVE
Oh no Bill I think something
is definitely wrong I think the

trucks are coming
DIANA
Oh no

Light slowly starts to drain from the big light above the dance
floor There is a slow screeching sucking sound with the
decreasing light

Now the kitchen doors fly open The cook stands trembling and
screaming

COOK
All my animals Bleeding from the mouth
» All my animals going wild

My PIG

Suddenly a small screaming pig rushes into the club zig-zagging
all around crazily The cook screaming and running after it
Everyone in the club is now tense standing looking around
worried The orchestra plays but musicians are missing notes

and not following the score The Detective and Diana cling to
each other The bleeding pig races past them

OLD WOMAN
Oh my A pig is loose Oh my

OLD GENTLEMAN
Its bleeding from the mouth Look at
e blood

ca

Out in the street two giant trucks are coming toward the circle
club Each truck shooting electrical sparks high into the air
The sound is deafening

Inside the club the pig races into another crowd More screams
Then a loud gunshot

MAN 1
I shot a pig I shot a pig Why did
I do that

The lights are all flickering now giving the place a strange
nervous feeling Sucking and screeching sounds getting louder
and more frequent Musicians playing horribly--erratic--ner-
vous
The cook rushes up to the man who shot his pig

COOK
My God You shot my Pig

He tries to kill the pigshooter with his bare hands People
hold him back

Suddenly a tall man with a beard a pipe and a black and red
checkered lumber jacket pushes his way through the crowd to the
dead pig With a booming voice he speaks

LUMBER MAN
I can throw that pig

COOK
Dont throw my pig

PIG SHOOTER
Its dead whatdyou care

COOK
Dont throw it

LUMBER MAN
I can throw that pig farther than anyone
can By God I know I can

MAN IN CROWD
Ill bet you cant throw that pig clear
across the room

LUMBER MAN
Watch me MOVE BACK (calling out
very loud) Watch out IM GOING

TO THROW A PIG OVER THERE

People begin frantically clearing away from the line of flight

COOK (holding his head between his
hands)
Leave it alone That was a damn good
pig too now look at it

The Lumber Man grabs the pig by the hind legs and like a chain

ball he starts twirling himself and the pig faster and
faster People scream and move back The Lumber Man twirls
faster Everyone is watching him now

Bill moves closer to the Detective The Detective has been watch-
ing the pig but has kept an eye on Bill too Bill is smiling
in an evil way The Detective holds Diana closer

Outside the big trucks round the corner People are screaming -
sparks shoot crazily Some people burst into flames Others
bounce or gyrate

Inside the Lumber Man twirls violently with the pig one more
revolution then with tremendous force releases it The pig flys
wildly through the air across the night club and crashes into
the far wall bounces back with a squeak onto a table crushing
it to the floor The sounds of the truck are now heard inside
the Club All begin to go wild

LUMBER MAN
I KNEW I could I told you all

DETECTIVE (to Diana)
Take these here it comes

He jabs a knitting needle into each of her legs then he does

the same to himself He puts a pin cushion inside his collar
and forces the pins into his skin The big light screeches like
hell then blows all over the room Other lights pulsate vio-
lently A horse and two cows all bleeding heavily from the
mouth come out of the kitchen The horse whinnies horribly
Their eyes are wild

The horrible sound of buzzing hissing humming electricity

is heard Wall sockets spurt electrical sparks As the room
gets darker and the people start to get confused Absurdity

runs rampant People try to eat their hands or feet They crawl
on or under the tables Their tongues get tied and they cant
speak Some more small table lamps begin to blow out

Tll bet you I can spit says one man Out comes his tongue
but no spit The Lumber Mans pipe starts spewing smoke in huge
clouds Lets jump off a table yells someone in a rage

The Donut Man appears on the stage The Detective is trying

to turn himself in a circle while he is standing on his head

His girl Diana is in a fetal position as if she is trying despe-
rately to propell herself through water Her tongue is cut and
pressed against her cheek People are running furiously for
unknown destinations The orchestra is totally confused and

is playing very abstract sound arrangements Some musicians

even destroying their instruments in the process The drummer

is playing very complicated jazz timings and the audience is
beginning to shake and gyrate in robot like movements The music
becomes more and more abstract sounding like a syncopated barnyard
button factory All the while its getting darker and darker
Then the Black Coats enter They begin to violently zap people
while the Donut Man stands in front of the orchestra smiling
and eating donuts His eyes bug out with sadistic happiness

The black coats try to zap the Detective and Diana but they are
clinging to each other and it is at this point that they realize
that their love is protecting them They yell at the Black Coats

DIANA
You cant hurt us because we love each
other so much

DETECTTVE
Shes right

BLACK COATS
But we can separate you

They grab Diana and pull her away from the Detective

BLACK COAT (contd)
(to Detective)
Can you say separate

The Detective watches in horror as they drag her away She is
screaming desperately

DETECTIVE (hardly able to talk)
Come back

Their eyes watch each other until Diana disappears in the dark-
ness SPARKS All is death bodies barely move Bill
stands against a far wall staring at the Detective The orchestra
is almost silent--only the barest most abstract arrangement now--
very low--very strange Suddenly in this darkness a man enters
The Detective is so far gone he cannot see him clearly The man
walks silently through the bodies but with his back to the Detec-
tive The man extends his arms toward the far wall Bolts of
dark electricity issue from his finger tips and shoot into the
dead pig Now a horrible thing the dead pig comes to life
and stands up like a human Its hind legs growing longer the
pigs stands in the darkness in front of the unknown man and

along with the very low strange music The pigs says Life

is a donut Then issues a horrifying laugh The man and the

pig both laugh then The unknown man moves his hand up and down
The pig speaks again

PIG
(slowly and strangely)
I know a man who is afraid of dogs

The donut man laughs Bill laughs The Detective watches in
horror his mind trying straining to cling to consciousness
Outside the trucks have just passed The streets are quiet
The circle club sign is barely lit but it is visible Terry
runs quickly down the street toward the circle club

INT HIGH SCHOOL - MAIN CITY - DAY

CU Ronnie He is sitting in a classroom in high school The
room is very dirty and drab Soot clouds go by and smoke stacks
blow out smoke and everything is dingy The blackboard is filthy
with coal dust and the white chalk looks dark grey The teacher
is an old man with wild hair and glasses With a long pointer

in his hand he is pointing to a detailed drawing of a dog with
stars and swirling lines around it as if it may be some constel-
lation in space

TEACHER
Can anyone show us the equation for the
time involved here

No one raises his hand Ronnie is sitting in a desk by the wall
His acne has gotten even worse and together with his red hair

he is quite a sight He is still wearing his chest apparatus
and still needs a plug-in every fifteen minutes The little
warning sound is going and he is just rising to go with his plug
to the wall when the teacher spots him

TEACHER (contd)
All right Ronnie step to the blackboard
and write out the equation (Ronnie
doesnt move) Step to the board and
write out the equation

Ronnie goes to the board and stands there Finally the teacher
goes and puts a piece of chalk in his hand Ronnie puts his
nose right next to the blackboard and very carefully draws a
very small symbol like the ones in the hospital

STUDENT
Not again

Even before Ronnie finishes the second symbol the teacher is
asking for another student
TEACHER
Can anyone write out the proper equation
Jane

JANE
All right

Jane is a very beautiful girl who is stacked She is dressed
in a tight white sweater and a black tight skirt She has blonde
bee-hived hair She goes to the board and begins to write out
her answers Meanwhile Ronnie is still working on his symbols
Some guys and the teacher are looking at Janes beautiful body
Suddenly the bell rings and Ronnies head flies back violently
and his mouth opens wide School is over for the day All the
students leave the room bumping into Ronnie who is going to
his desk to get his books On the way out he and the teacher
stare at each other Ronnie is in sort of a trance running
low on electricity

TEACHER
Schools out for the day Ronnie

Ronnie leaves the room The hall is practically empty The
clock says 330 Ronnie grabs hold of his plug and as he walks
down the hall he looks from side to side for an outlet There
are none in the hall He comes to come steps leading down to

the basement and he follows them down--looking for an outlet
Finding no outlets on the steps he pushes the basement doors
open and enters a large room where a rock and roll band is setting
up to rehearse They are getting equipment together and tuning
up as Ronnie enters The musicians are factory greaser types
dressed in black suits The band is not big time but they do
have managers The main manager is a fat man who is mean and
powerful His name is MR BARKO and his associate is MR GREEN
Ronnie goes to the opposite end of the room and plugs in minding
his own business There are a few other kids in the room waiting
to hear the band play

MR BARKO

(to the band)
You guys are late setting up for
rehearsals again Im SICK of this
Were not going to win any record deal
tomorrow night if you guys dont get
to work Ill pull my money out quick
Ill break a few arms too we
dont want to manage a bunch of losers

MR GREEN
(under his breath to Barko)

We may not want to but I think we are

MR BARKO
Hey Johnny lets go

JOHNNY
Sorry Mr Barko but we got a lot of
equipment to set up Were almost ready

Johnny plugs in some big amplifiers and microphones All the
equipment has a very foreign look to it It is equipment that

is very strange looking the microphones are very large the
amps and speakers and equipment are all jet black and very
strangely designed like a cross between 1920s electrical and

a gloss black Porche speedster The band is ready and they warm
up by playing about fifteen seconds of very cool music then
Johnny stops and takes a long cord and finding no other place

to plug it in goes over to where Ronnie is sitting to use his
outlet He and Ronnie look at each other as Johnny plugs in

his cord right above Ronnies Johnny is carrying his electric
guitar and in order to test the new change he turns his guitar

on and begins to play SUDDENLY out of Ronnies mouth comes

a very strange loud musical sound The sound scares Johnny
Ronnie then lets out another strange sound a musical scream

and one of the bands speakers begins to vibrate and it blows
out Ronnie begins to make some new strange sounds sounds he
has never made before and he begins to twitch in a rhythm and

for a short while something begins to happen but Ronnie pulls

his cord out and stops The entire Band is staring at Ronnie

Outside Dan and Bob pull up to the high school and wait for
Ronnie

Back inside Johnny is still staring in disbelief at Ronnie

MR BARKO
What happened Lets get to work
leave that kid alone Whats going on
here

JOHNNY
Wait a minute we could use this
kid Ive never seen or heard anything
like him We could use this kid Mr
Barko

MR BARKO
(Thinking then looking at Mr Green

eyebrows go up then turning to Ronnie
squinting at him) Whats your name

Ronnie is silent

MR BARKO (contd)
Hey kid whats your name
They walk towards him Ronnie remains silent

MR BARKO (contd)
Johnny take him over and see what he
can do

JOHNNY
Come here kid

Johnny takes Ronnie over to the rest of the band up on the stage
and puts him in front of a microphone When everyone is set

he puts Ronnie in Instantly he screams but he and the music
cause the scream to be beautiful and then he twitches and moves
in rhythm with the drummer Ronnie begins to make strange sounds
which work together with the music Some more students hurry
into the room drawn by the music The managers hurry into the
room drawn by the music The managers notice this The kids
are staring in disbelief at Ronnie Johnny signs a few lines
and Rennie mimicks him in a very strangely cool way Ronnie
starts to vibrate and he turns around and all the instruments
change together going way up then down Ronnie looks great in
front of ihe microphone and this rock and roll is totally crazy
and heavy and the students who are witnessing it are spellbound
The band is really going

the microphone As the applause dies down someone yells out
Whats your name The others begin to ask As the applause
is almost gone there is a short space of silence coming up into
which Ronnie inserts

RONNIE
Ronnie Rocket

The song ends the people break into applause Ronnie is gripping

People begin to say his name out loud as they burst into applause

again Ronnie tries to pull his plug but Johnny has to help
him When Ronnie finally gets unplugged he starts walking back-
wards in a circle and finally falls down and sort of collapses
There are a few screams by some girls and lots of murmurings
Mr Barko and Mr Green hold the kids back as they try to get
up close to Ronnie to see if he is all right Just then Dan
and Bob enter and look around They are about to turn and go
when they hear someone mention Ronnie Rocket They go into the
room Finally they see him and rush to him

DAN
What happened Ronnie (to others around)
What happened to him
JOHNNY
He was playing some music with us and
guess it got him tired or something

MR BARKO
Are you the kids father or what

DAN
Yeah come on Bob lets get him home

Dan picks up Ronnie and carries him out of the room

MR BARKO
(to the band)
You guys keep rehearsing well be right
back (he winks at them)

JOHNNY
Get that kid

Mr Barko and Mr Green catch up to Dan Bob and Ronnie by their
car The Doctors Dan and Bob stare at Mr Barko and Mr Green

MR BARKO
Were very interested in your boy there

DAN
Why what did he do

BOB
(he and Dan defensive)
What is it

MR BARKO

(chewing a cigar)
Hey wait a minute he didnt do anything
except make great music Your kids

big I mean your kids got something
We want to make a deal together we can
make more money than you ever dreamed
of Are you his father

DAN
(looks quickly at Bob)
Yeah Bobs my partner Whats the deal

Ronnie is feeling much better and during Mr Barkos talk he

has wandered out onto the ground in front of the school As

the deal is being made Ronnie wanders around He looks up to

a window in the school and sees a boy and a girl They are talk-
ing then she pushes him he pushes her Then we see Mr Barko
and Mr Green from a distance talking with Dan and Bob Then
Ronnies acne covered face looking up at the window The boy

and girl come together in a long tender kiss Ronnie watches
them Then Ronnie turns and sees Mr Barko and Mr Green shaking
hands with Dan and Bob

Then from a distance we see Ronnie standing alone turning in
a small circle

Later at Deborahs apartment Ronnie is sitting at the dinner
table with Deborah Dan and Bob but he is at the other end
by himself while the others talk

BOB
Yes and he starts tomorrow night
Theres some contest we should have
enough money to get all new equipment

her hand and kisses up her arm passionately Ronnie sits at

the other end of the table watching

DAN
Well never leave you Deborah

BOB

She begins to rub her breasts in front of Bob while Dan removes

her stockings

Ronnie is in the livingroom He is staring off into the ceiling
He eyes are following some unseen object around and around and

around

Friday night Outside the factories blow howling smoke At
the school dance the room is crowded Deborah Dan and Bob

are in the audience

strange looking teenagers all around The

high school principal is there and Ronnies teacher even the
stern little lady receptionist

Behind stage the band is almost ready to go Mr Barko is off
stage chewing a big cigar Johnny is setting Ronnie up by the

microphone

JOHNNY

(to Ronnie)
You okay (no answer) Youre
okay Just stand there and then when

the curtain up here (he points) when
it opens Ill plug you in and well

RONNIE

JOHNNY
Thats right kid Well really go

Johnny looks to the other members of the band to see if theyre
ready the nod that they are Johnny signals Mr Barko Mr
Barko goes to the Master of Ceremonies

MR BARKO

(to MC)
Okay theyre ready now and remember
introduce them as Ronnie Rocket

MC
All right fine Mr Barko

From behind the curtain Ronnie hears the MC

M C (contd )
Ladies and gentlemen the last band
to perform tonight in the contest is
now ready Ladies and gentlemen
RONNIE ROCKET

As the curtains open there is applause but it soon stops Ronnie
isnt on the stage and the rest of the band stands embarrassed

in the uncomfortable silence The curtain closes Backstage

Mr Barko is furious He sees Bob walking Ronnie by the hand
towards him and the stage

BOB
Can I help it if he had to do to the
bathroom
MR BARKO

Hurry up and get him back on that stage

Ronnie now high steps across the stage The MC can be heard
re-introducing Ronnie Rocket Johnny turns up all the power

he can There is a loud hissing sound coming from all the
speakers The curtain opens just as Ronnie high steps into place
in front of the microphone

The curtains open very slowly Ronnie locks himself in front

of the microphone hands gripping it and knees bent
ready to go Johnny plugs Ronnie in He begins to vibrate like
crazy He screams out and the music begins The music is pound-
ing and powerful The audience is loving it Ronnie falls to
one knee and Dan and Bob look at each other with worry in their
eyes Suddenly sparks come from Ronnies mouth and the music
gets wilder Ronnie shakes violently Ronnie starts to gag

and the lights go way low He shakes in rhythm with the drummer
When Johnny sings Ronnie tries to mimick him His eyes bug

but The kids are watching Ronnie dumbfounded The ones
that started to dance have stopped and are watching Ronnie

gags more sparks then whines The guitar starts to whine the
organ whines Ronnie falls to the floor gagging and jerking

Dan holds Bob back from helping him because he wants to see if
Ronnie can make it through alone Ronnie starts mimicking
Johnnys echo reverbing rock and roll voice then starts to scream
out This causes some electrical disturbances Electricity
seems to go through the air between Ronnie and the instruments
The sounds jump accordingly Finally sounds are at a fever pitch
and Johnny decides that he should end the song Ronnie is gagging
pretty badly and is on the floor Johnny pulls Ronnies plug

RONNIE
(yelling)
Ronnie Rocket

Just after the music stops and the lights come up the applause

is thunderous and Ronnie passes out The curtain closes Johnny
and Fred (the bass player) pick Ronnie up and carry him back-
stage Dan and Bob and Deborah are very upset

DAN
(to Bob)
Go get your bag and Ill meet you back-
stage (to Deborah) Come with me

BOB
Ill go fast (to himself) as he goes
through the crowd) Ill go fast

Dan and Deborah run backstage where things are in somewhat of
a turmoil Dan spots Mr Green

DAN
(excited)
Wheres Ronnie

MR GREEN

Mr Green points to a door marked Private down a hallway

Dan and Deborah hurry to the door and both of them begin knocking
on it No one answers but they hear moans and sounds within

The door is locked

DAN
OPEN UP OPEN UP (to Deborah)
Go get Mr Green or Mr Barko to open
this door

DEBORAH

She goes hurrying off back down the hall Bob comes running

in the other way and Deborah points toward Dan Bob hurries
down to join Dan in front of the locked door Bobs shoulders
are going way up and down as he breathes heavily

BOB
(out of breath)

DAN
The doors locked Ronnies in there

Just then the door opens Its a nurse answering the knock

NURSE

DAN

He and Bob go through the door

NURSE
Wait a minute

BOB
You wait a minute

In the next room they see a doctor with Ronnie The doctor is
fooling around with Ronnies appliance and Ronnie is jumping
and sparking and the doctor is getting electrical shocks every
few seconds and yelling out Dan and Bob move the nurse aside
and rush toward Ronnie The doctor looks up and suddenly Bob
and Dan freeze just as they were about to enter the room They
recognize this doctor and he recognizes them

DOCTOR

NURSE

(hurrying forward)

The doctor gasps as he realizes why Ronnie is the way he is
he looks aghast at Ronnie then up to Bob and Dan Then his
astonishment turns to anger

DOCTOR

till Mr Barko hears about this

Bob and Dan look at each other

DAN

Bob begins chasing the nurse and Dan leaps on the doctor hitting
him hard

Meanwhile Deborah has found Mr Barko talking with the MC

When they open the door and enter Deborah screams The nurse
is taped up to a filing cabinet just inside the door Her eyes
are wild her mouth is taped shut Bob is administering drugs
etc to Ronnie on the cot in the next room Dan has the doctor
held in his lap with his belt running-through the doctors mouth
causing the doctors head to bend back at a very uncomfortable
angle The doctor begins to make gurgling sounds when he sees
Mr Barko The doctors eyes are also wild Deborah covers

her mouth with both her hands
MR BARKO
What the hell is this

DAN
(still pulling the belt)

Fred the bass player realizes that the nurse is still tied

up he removes the tape from her mouth A cooing moaning sigh
escapes through her sore but full and beautiful lips The doctor
sees Fred to do this All eyes go to the doctor as he yells

DOCTOR
Dont you touch her

And he rushes to his nurse

REHEARSAL HALL Dan and Bob and Deborah look at each other
worried because Ronnie has been talking to himself in the micro-
phone saying frantic little half sentences word fragments
Johnny is trying to work on a song and find out new sounds Ronnie

in order to protect themselves from the electricity Johnny
plugs Ronnie in Ronnies eyes bug out and he starts to shimmy
across the stage The drummer AL is going with Ronnie Fred
and Johnny start experimenting They move levers and walk closer
to Ronnie stand at different angles to him etc Their sounds
starts going up and down or louder or softer Sometimes speakers
begin to screech and Ronnie himself is twirling crawling
jumping gagging mimicking Johnnys voice or lying out flat

on the floor twitching Electricity is flying all around

After the rehearsal Dan and Bob attend to Ronnie A close up

of Ronnie reveals bad eyes and a dopey look Also a small amount
of blood in the ears They are very concerned for his health
Bob is checking out Ronnies electrical device because he is

DRUM BEAT

Ronnie jerks and says No

Another beat

Then the bass and guitar begin to play and Ronnie begins to
vibrate on the floor He gags out some sparks and then whines
from real low to real high and gets up only to drop again Quiet
a heavy beat Ronnie howls a weird electrical sound and his

eyes strain in the control booth two engineers scramble for

a smoking box which is shooting sparks The bass begins again
Ronnie jitters to his feet gets a shock from the microphone
Makes some series of noises into the microphone and the organ
guitar and bass and drums start to really go Johnnys echo
begins to sing and Ronnie begins to mimick Hes really moving
to the beat Theyve got him in a great little black suit and
it looks good with-his pompadore red hair wig After a long
whine at the end Johnny pulls the plug Ronnie collapses and
crawls around on the floor

Up stairs the engineers have a fire extinguisher out and theyre
spraying a whole smoking area of equipment The room is cloudy
with smoke and there is an ominous electrical hum going signaling
some sort of malfunction

white t-shirt and black pants and shoes He has black greasy
hair

RILEY

RILEY

The presence of Riley as so accurately predicted by Bill makes
the Detective nervous Bill smiles at the Detective

BILL
What did I tell ya (now to Riley) turn
the set on Riley lets see Science
World

Riley goes to the set Eleane sits down on the couch across

the room with two of her children They are like animals bounc-
ing on the couch laughing jeering little laughs and hitting
Eleane in he face over and over She never does anything to

stop them They are totally out of control

Science world comes on with at first some very strange music
Then we see three men two of them in white lab coats the third
in a baggy tweed suit

The lab coated scientists (1 and 2) are assembling a metal
box with electrical equipment inside The other man is watching
them 1 is having trouble putting in a screw on the back panel

2 wants to help but is not because he wants to let his partner
do it alone The man on the other hand thinks he can put the
screw in better himself so he is trying to get close and do

it but 2 is pressing very hard against the man to keep him

away from his partner The man is pressing very hard too but

it is a stand off basically every now and again one inches
the other back but each is holding his own Meanwhile 1 keeps
turning the screw but it keeps getting a bad start and keeps
popping out onto the floor

The Detective looks over at Bill who is standing up
DETECTIVE
Where are you going Sit down

BILL
Just to the table there for some smokes

DETECTIVE
All right but Im watching you

He watches Bill move further away from him into the shadowy dining
room Terry and Riley give each other nervous ‘looks The Detec-
tive almost catches this He looks at each of them then back

up to Bill who is far away now wearing a big smile and disappear-
ing into the darkness on the far side of the dining room He

is gone Riley looks very nervous and so does Terry Suddenly
from directly behind the Detective chairs Bill pops up He
knocks the gun from the Detectives hand It flies to the floor
Bill gets the Detective in a hammerlock hold

BILL
Terry Pick up the gun

As Terry goes for the gun

DETECTIVE (to Terry)
I thought you were my friend

TERRY

Think again

Terry hands the gun to Bill as Bill comes around to face the
Detective

BILL
Wheres your gun Bud Why its
right here pointin a bullet right through
your nose and remember behind

that nose is that delicate little sack
of brains What a mess that is when
its blowed open so you want to
meet Hank Bartells Is that it

DETECTIVE
Yeah Ive been telling Terry here
that since I met im I sure do

BILL
Well I knew you were stupid but I didnt
know how stupid till now OK
Im takin you in as soon as I get
the go ahead from Hank Ill talk to
him later until then come here
I gotta nice little room next to mine
where I want you to stay

The Detective is sitting on a low single bed the only piece
of furniture in the small room with one window Bill stands
at the door

BILL
My wife and I are sleeping right outside
your door Dont try to leave rem-
ember I have the gun

Bill shuts the door and the Detective is alone He lays down
props his head up with the filthy feather pillow and crosses
his feet Outside the window dust and smoke are blowing silently

DETECTIVE (to himself)
Why are they going to let me in the inner
city so easily I think thats
the only place they can kill me
What a world

DISSOLVE

Later the Detective hears the door open slowly and he waits in
fear to see who will enter It is Eleane Bills wife She
comes into the room in her robe and closes the door behind her
in the grey half light she moves closer to the Detective She
opens her robe and shows the Detective her breasts as she moves
her tongue around her lips The Detective stares at her Sud-
denly there is a crack and she instantly covers herself and
freezes They realize it was only a floor board or something
but the magic sexual moment has been destroyed She whimpers

ELEANE
The boy Riley wants to see you in the
living room Be very quiet Bills a
very light sleeper

The Detective gets up and Eleane guides him past Bill sleeping
down a hallway and lets him go alone into the living room while
she stands guard Riley nods to the Detective The Detective
looks at Riley curiously Riley shows the Detective a small
black box

RILEY
I made it watch

He plugs the box into a wall socket and turns on the television
He clips another cord from the black box onto the aerial on top
of the TV He starts turning a dial A hum starts and it gets
lower and lower until on the television they start to see an
image It is Ronnie The Detective is amazed He gets closer
to the set He looks at Riley Riley smiles The Detective
smiles back then they watch Ronnie He is being attended by

Bob and Dan Deborah is in the background

DETECTIVE
I recognize them

RILEY
Doctors Ive been watching them
Theyre good people trying to help
Ronald Hes getting too much electricity
though you gotta hurry Ive
been taking readings

DETECTIVE
Who knows about this

RILEY
You and me you gotta get to Hank
Bartells fast

DETECTIVE
Yeah I know Ive been trying

Just then there is a scream Eleane comes flying into the living-
room and falls face down all bloody Riley shuts the image
off instantly Bill stands smiling but enraged

BILL (yelling)

TERRY TERRY WERE GOIN NOW GET
UP (then he speaks to the Detective
and Riley) Were going on a trip

» you too Riley my little science friend
itll be just the little trip youve
always dreamed of

Terry comes out in a daze Hes still pulling up his pants and
hooking his belt

TERRY
WHERE WE GOIN

BILL (smiling)
The inner city

Eleane moans in her painful state of unconsciousness

EXT DARK FIELD - GATE HOUSE - NIGHT

The Detective and Riley are led through the darkness by Bill

who holds the gun on them Terry follows They approach a small
gate house by a huge old corroded chain link fence Above the
gate there is a dirty neon white circle of light A crowd of
knitters have gathered and are following the detective Isnt
he a honey oh I could just eat him up they say Bill

is furious with the knitters

BILL
Damn knitters (yelling at them)
Get the hell out of here

TERRY (to Detective)

See the circle

DETECTIVE
Shut up Terry Nobodys talking
to you any more

TERRY
Watch out around here

BILL
Shut up you two Now stop right
there at the gate (Knitters move in
closer) GET AWAY FILTHY KNITTERS
» GET OUT

Bill goes into the gatehouse furious The Detective watches

him talking to two men in uniform Riley shares a nervous look
with the Detective Terry paces and as he paces he paces up

near the Gate house The Detective watches him curiously Terry
moves near the window of the gatehouse He stands looking
inside The buzz of the neon circle is loud Now the two guards
are coming out with Bill The knitters hvae now moved very far
away in the darkness

GUARD 1
» this I gotta see Hey which
one of you can stand on one leg
(the Detective steps forward) You
DETECTIVE

Yes
GUARD 2
Lets see you do it and while youre
at it we heard you could speak as you
do it so do that too

The Detective raises his foot once again and holds it up with
his hand As he stands on the one foot he speaks

DETECTIVE
The Detectives Motto stay alert
» concentrate stay clean
Far away the knitters all ooh and aah so impressed with
the Detective
GUARD 1

Ill be damned and hes close to
the line too

BILL
By the way tell the Detective what
that ole line is

The Guard points to a point beyond the gate then to the
Detective who remains on one foot

GUARD 1
See out there around that rock
Thats about forty feet inside
Thats where the power will hit and
you sure as hell wont be able to stand
on one foot out there Youll feel
ground dip way down and as you go
in there youll feel it come over
and the closer you get to
station the worse it gets

The Detective comes back to a two-legged stand

DETECTIVE
Are there people in there
other than Hank Bartells

GUARD 2
Sure theres people theyre all
over the place (Riley looks
at the Detective)
GUARD 1
Youll love ‘em

GUARD 2
Take em in Bill

BILL
OK-you guys lets go come on
lets show this Detective what hes
missing come on Go

He makes the Detective and Riley go first and hurries to
follow In the distance the knitters all call care-
full

GUARD 1
So long

He and the other guard laugh

GUARD 2
Its been good to know ya

The darkness seems to swallow them up as they go through the
gate They are getting closer and closer to the rock and the
forty foot mark The Detective looks back but the guard house
is so dark he can barely see it and it seems at least a hundred
feet away Now he looks at Bill and Terry Bill is smiling
such an evil smile Terry is looking nervously about Riley

is now looking at him and nodding at the marker rock which they
just passed The ground begins sloping rapidly downwards The
Detective looks out ahead Darkness old pipes Oily black
ground Old wires An electrical hum is heard slightly Then
suddenly the hum is thunderous The buzzing is deafening They
all (except Bill) begin to walk funny They have trouble keeping
their balance Now the Detective looks back The gatehouse

is gone Bill is laughing but the other sounds drown it out
The Detective holds his head He feels so strangely ill Riley
is unable to walk correctly Terry is struggling The sounds
now begin to decrease but the effect of the electricity remains
Suddenly Terry yells out

TERRY
Now

He leaps on Bills back knocking the pistol away The pistol
flips up out and into a small oil sludge pool and it disappears

TERRY
Get the gun (the voice is very strange)

DETECTIVE
(smiling up at Terry then quickly
running to find the gun only to realize
that its sunk beyond retrieving) Its
gone (strange garbled voice)

Terry is riding Bill around as if he was a horse He tries to
bring him down but Bill is too strong

TERRY
We got to kill him hurry Find
something to kill him with quick I
cant hold him

Riley and the Detective race and wobble around in the darkness
trying to find some sort of a weapon as Terry rides the screaming
madman Bill around in a wild circle Finally Riley finds a
piece of iron pipe and yells out then gives it to the Detective
The Detective weighs it in his hands then goes after Bill He
swings He hits Terry in the back

TERRY
OWW Not me

DETECTIVE
« SORRY

He swings again and this time hits Bill real hard in the head
Some blood shoots out but Bill remains VERY strong Bill screams
out He tries to kick the Detective The Detective swings again
and smashes Bills nose Blood gushes He swings again The
swing misses Riley finds a rock and waits for a good shot He
throws and hits Terry square in the head

TERRY
Ahh

RILEY
Sorry Terry sorry

Riley goes to find another rock The Detective swings again
This time the pipe lands on top of Bill s head There is a loud
cracking sound and more blood but Bill keeps going even wilder
than before The Detective hits again and again striking severe
blows Terry wrenches Bills neck this way and that trying to
bring him down Riley finds a brick and finally finds a shot
The brick hits Bill in the forehead He staggers The Detective
connects four more times with solid blows with the pipe Bills
smile and his screams disappear A dazed wild look takes their
place He falls to his knees The Detective raises the pipe

as high as he can and gives Bill the final blow Bill collapses
face first into a small mound of sludge The three of them share
a look of relief as they catch their breath
DETECTIVE
Thank God youre on our side Terry

TERRY
Did you ever have an doubt sucker

DETECTIVE
You know I did

Terry smiles then Riley and the Detective follow

Suddenly

Riley produces from his pocket a black electrical box and several

feet of cord

RILEY
(laughing bouncing up and down)
Look what I smuggled in

They all laugh happily then Terrys smile fades as he stands

up

TERRY
I dont know why were laughing

ing) What are we gonna do

DISSOLVE TO

EXT INNER CITY - NIGHT (Note All inner city scenes will have
distorted walking and talking)

The Detective Terry and Riley all have knitting needles pin
cushions and various pain devices tied all over them They all
look like Van Gogh bandaged after he cut off his ear Still
they walk and talk strangely When they feel real strange they
pierce themselves with another needle or pin They are ina
very brutal area of the inner City They are just now entering

a dark street of row houses They are creeping along in the
black shadows In the distance a GIGANTIC BLACK ELECTRIC FACTORY
CAN BE SEEN SPEWING TONS OF BLACK SMOKE OUT THROUGH ONE HUNDRED
BLACK STACKS GIANT ELECTRICAL HUMS AND ARCINGS PERMEATE THE
AIR The small street lights rattle and pulsate violently

It is as if a thousand subway trains were just below

TERRY
Weve got to get off the street Theres
all those black coats out to kill us
» we should find a place to stay
inside quick

DETECTIVE
All right lets find a house

They sneak up to the closest window and peer in Inside they
see a very dirty fat man in a t-shirt tying a knot in a big
rose His face has many warts

They creep to another window Inside is a fairly nice looking
dark-haired woman with just a few warts on her face Her house
looks dark except for back in the kitchen area where she is
pouring herself something to drink They stay crouched down
outside the window--playing it safe

RILEY
Oh oh here come some more black
coats

A gang of men in dark overcoats come walking quickly down the
street They each look with fear as the gang approaches

TERRY
Stay down and shut up

a long drum roll then Johnny plugs Ronnie in He starts vibrat-
ing and sparking Electra Cute comes tap dancing in from the
side She tap dances up to Ronnie and touches him and suddenly
shes all aglow She starts shrieking out a hllgh pitched song
Her act is that she sings and moves as if shes being electra-
cuted by high voltage She sings two songs After the first
song she dances over to Ronnie to get a new charge from him
She really gets going Ronnie gets going too but pretty much
ends up banging his head against the floor over and over again
and occasionally shoots out some sparks Electra Cute gets lots
of applause when she finishes then she leaves Johnny

helps Ronnie back up to the microphone He mumbles a few things
and the audience applauds thunderously Then Ronnie falls over
Johnny signals to Fred and he pushes one of the levers on the

new black box There is a loud humming sound and the lights

dim Ronnie starts flipping Johnny helps him up again This
time the band starts right in Fred gives another jab to the
lever Ronnie mimicks out one of Johnnys songs The crowd

is loving every minute of it Just at the one song ends the
music seques into another tune the lighting changes and a back
curtain opens Out come one hundred heavy-duty saxophone players
rocking together with Ronnie Rocket Ronnie is flipping and jump-
ing sparking and smoking and finally moaning bug-eyed on the
floor after his wig blows off sometime during the number His
bald head with some fat brown hairs is sweating and when Johnny
Pulls the plug Ronnie collapses and writhes in a bad fit on

the stage floor They close the curtains The audience stamps
and yells for more Ronnie Rocket Dan and Bob rush out and carry
Ronnie to his room They give him a shot Ronnie is in real

bad shape Deborah sits at his side holding his little hand
Upon checking the electrical chest device Bob notices that the
rubber bag is filled with green fluid

into the laboratory and face Dan and Bob Ronnie is still sitting
in his chair in a deep sleep

MR BARKO
(quite loud)
End their lives

Mr Green raises his gun

DAN
RUN

Bob and Dan start running around the laboratory trying to get
to a safe place behind the big machinery Mr Green fires a
shot It strikes machinery and some sparks fly The needles
on some dials move and a humming sound is heard Ronnie starts
coming to

Mr Green moves and sees Bob He fires but misses again Ronnie
starts to moan
BOB
(fear in his voice)
Get out of here Barko and leave us alone

MR BARKO
(calmly)
Youll be alone in a minute

Mr Green fires again He hits a bunch of dials and controls
Needles jump and Ronnies head goes back He sits up some and
starts meaning louder The humming sound continues and other

electrical sounds begin

DAN
(from his hiding place)

BOB
(yells backs)

Dan picks up an old wrench and throws it at Mr Green It misses

Mr Green moves slowly up between the machinery He spots Bob
He fires just as Bob sees him Bob is dead a bullet in
the chest

Bob You okay Bob
Mr Green turns to pursue Dan

Dan comes rushing out suddenly from behind the machines He
rushes toward Mr Green Green fires at him and blows Dan back

BOB

Ronnies still screaming and the machines are loud As Dan pulls
himself up he comes face to face with the screaming Ronnie

Mr Green has reloaded his gun Mr Barko smiles Dan turns
and Mr Green shoots him in the head

Mr Green then goes around pulling out all the plugs The machi-
nery begins to whine down and finally the machines and Ronnie
are quiet But there is still a scream and a pounding

on the closet door Mr Green fires a shot through the door
the scream stops and there is a thud

Deborah is gone also

MR BARKO

Mr Green undoes Ronnie from the wires and picks him up Ronnie
is moaning

RONNIE
(moans)
You wrecked us

Mr Green carries Ronnie out of the laboratory Mr Barko turns
the lights off and follows him The door slams shut One small
light remains on It illuminates Dans arm and head and Ronnies
special chair The image turns into a wall of fire

INNER CITY - DARK HAIRED WOMANS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Suddenly the door to the basement opens and a young girl sixteen
years old comes into the kitchen Her face is hideously covered
with warts Her teeth are broken and brown with bleeding gums
She eyes the three suspiciously and goes to the refrigerator

She opens the door Inside she grabs some filthy piece of food-
stuff out from amongst several decaying black cartons and cans
and foul wrappings She smiles the bloody broken toothed mouth
at the Detective and goes back into the basement The Detective
can see the old piece of meat she retrieved from the refrige-
rator It is covered in a black and white smeared mould After
she disappears into the basement the three of them hear something

in the livingroom Voices Mens voices
DETECTIVE
Riley take a look
TERRY
Oh my God

Riley goes to the kitchen door and opens it a crack In the
livingroom he sees a roomful of black coats Smiling milling
around One is coming toward him to the kitchen

RILEY
Black coats

Now the woman snaps awake She has a hideous murderous grin
on her face She laughs and their skin crawls

They fly down the basement stairs Thunder above Now they

are in the dark basement filled with slow dancers Suddenly

a girl slow dancer turns and comes running at them--arms out-
stretched in front of her Her mouth open with blood all over
her face Slow dancers tearing at them trying to bite them
They race into the bathroom and slam the door behind them Fists
knock loudly now on the other side The Detective spots a small
window up to street level

DETECTIVE
Riley up you go

Terry and the Detective hoist Riley up to open the window Sud-
denly the Detective feels a knife at his throat He turns
Terry turns--still holding Riley aloft

A girl named GERSTEIN dressed in a pretty chiffon desk is holding
the knife

GERSTEIN (to Detective)
Stop where are you going so fast
DETECTIVE
Were trying to leave here Please let
us go

GERSTEIN
Turn around slow

The Detective turns around He sees Gerstein She would be
very pretty except her face is covered with warts He can barely
see it is so dark

GERSTEIN

Dance with me
DETECTIVE

Please let me leave I have to leave
GERSTEIN

Dance with me or Ill stab you and kill

you

The Detective begins to dance with her She holds him very close
and puts the blade of the knife right on the skin of his neck

GERSTEIN
This is nice

They dance for a while the Detective can feel the blade
on his neck

GERSTEIN (contd)
Play with my hair

The Detective does as she says He puts his fingers in her hair
and gently rubs her hair and neck

GERSTEIN (contd)
Now kiss me

Riley and Terry watch silently holding VERY still

The Detective feels her slide her wart covered faced over his
cheek until their lips meet in quite a passionate kiss The girl
reaches up and pulls her shoulder straps down and pulls her dress

and bra away from her breasts

GERSTEIN
Feel me

There in more knocking at the door The music is still loud
GERSTEIN (contd)

(angry)
WHAT
STEVE
Gerstein its Steve get

GERSTEIN
In a minute (now to the Detective)
Feel me quick doit

The Detective feels her breasts and her head goes back in ectasy

GERSTEIN (contd
(coming forward)
Get out the window

STEVE
Hey come on get out here (he tries
the door) Come out here

Electric sparks shoot through the window knocking Riley and
Terry down The Detective looks at his hand Three of his

fingers are on fire Flames coming out of the ends of them
When Gerstein sees this she yells

GERSTEIN
Im coming now

She bolts through the door and Terry is able to pull it shut
and lock it again while the Detective stares at his burning
fingers Riley climbs back to the window and yanks it open

RILEY
Its open lets go

TERRY
(referring to fingers)
What is it

DETECTIVE
(as the flames go out)
Its a dream Lets get out of

here

They all scramble out to street level They run down the deserted
dark desolate street to hide in a corner factory building

In a nearby filthy oil field a group of black coats are running
around crazily They are catching dogs and throwing the dogs

up about 100 feet through the air to the top of a building

The dogs land and yelp and bark and down below the men laugh

and laugh They run around and catch another dog and throw it

up
DETECTIVE
Damn dogs are everywhere

TERRY
Dogs black coats donut men - Hank
Bartells Hey were in trouble

The Detectives eye is caught by a light on the right side of
the field high in the night sky Then another light and
another The lights flare up and then fall to the ground in
a streamer

DETECTIVE
(very excited)
Its happening

RILEY-TERRY
Whats that

DETECTIVE
Come on Its those friends of
Ronalds hurry Its Bob and
Dan and Deborah
TERRY

It is Who are they

They run across the field and in the darkness beyond three figures
emerge coming toward them They can barely walk the electricity

is so bad The Detective and Riley reach them first and Terry
wobbles in last The three stare at the three

DETECTIVE
Youre Bob and Dan and Deborah

Yes they say

DAN
Everythings on fire this is the
only place thats left

TERRY
Things are really comin apart

DETECTIVE
I am a Detective this is Terry
and Riley my friends we are all
friends of Ronalds but were the
only friends in this area of the city
» Youre in the inner city now
» thats Hank Bartells electrical power
station right over there

BOB
We were shot
TERRY
Yeah but yeah but
DETECTIVE
Look just dont lose conscious-
ness Terry you better give em

some pins or something

DAN
Theres a lot of electricity around here

RILEY
You said it
DEBORAH
Where is Ronnie
DETECTIVE
Well hes around
BOB
Whats that (referring to Rileys black
box)
RILEY
Its a deflector I built single
phase cuts through anything

» you wanta see it

BOB AND DAN
Yes

They begin studying the black box and asking Riley questions

DEBORAH
(crying)
What is happening

DAN
(to Riley)
It looks like everything is reversed
» we thought this but say
Bob I think we were right

theres a different kind of electricity

BOB
Snag that line up there and check the
polarities will ya Riley let me
see a reading

RILEY
Sure

TERRY
(to Detective)
You better show Bob and Dan those
symbols

The Detective gets out the piece of paper with the symbols
As Riley gives Bob and Dart the reading they asked for they all
study Donalds little drawings

DAN
I must have seen him draw these a hundred
times but never gave it a second thought

BOB
Me neither

DEBORAH
He was trying to tell us something
This is the most unfortunate thing that
parents sometimes do not listen to the
small words of their children

DAN
I think there has to be some strong inter-
ference here

DETECTIVE
There is His name is Hank Bartells
hes somewhere here possibly

in that power station

RILEY
All my readings indicate hes there

DETECTIVE
This symbol is a circle and it is followed
by this configuration We want this
» the broken circle so we
need this configuration

DAN
The triangle needs reversing Ive heard
of triangulation and I suppose it too
has contrasting possibilities

BOB
You mean You mean Hey
theres a triangulator in there and its
backwards

DAN
Right Bob and the circles are
getting smaller

DEBORAH
Oh can you make it right

TERRY
Theres one helluva great big problem
here cause the closer anyone gets
to that power station the harder it is
to think Theres rumors that a
person forgets his own name in there
» (to Detective) Can you still
stand on one leg try it (to
Everyone) try to stand on one leg

Everyone tries No one except the Detective can and he is very
wobbly

TERRY
Hes the only one who has a chance
confronting Hank Wed be useless
up close Is there anyway that
you could make that power reverse from
out here

DAN
I dont think so theres a tri-
angular set in there and someone has
to get to it and turn it around 180

CUT TO
MAIN CITY - NIGHT

Mr Barkos smiling face big cigar as he watches the tail
end of a performance of Ronnie Rocket The music is pounding
away

MR BARKO
(to Mr Green)
See the kids doing fine

They continue to watch Ronnie Ronnie gets weaker and weaker

MR BARKO (contd)
(yelling to the band)
Give him more juice

He hand signals more juice and Fred pushes gingerly on the
lever When Ronnie doesnt show much improvement Fred inches
the lever forward more and more Ronnie starts sparking and smok-
ing and vibrating on the floor but luckily

for him the song

is over When Johnny unplugs him Ronnie falls over and lays

still

Backstage the doctor and the band are laying Ronnie on the cot
Ronnie is having a strange fit His eyes are rolled back and

his back is arched and hes biting his tongue Mr Barko is there
watching Ronnie although hes the only one who really isnt aware

of Ronnies deteriorating condition

MR BARKO

Whatdya mean Whatdya mean-

DOCTOR

I told you I didnt know how Pink and
Platinum did this Hes dying Im telling
you I cant figure out what they did

MR BARKO
I told you to watch them

DOCTOR

Ill try to do something for him but

I dont know how

Ronnie is convulsing pretty bad

DOCTOR (contd)

As the band leaves the Doctor begins to check various areas

of Ronnie Mr Barko watches him
MR BARKO

DOCTOR

MR BARKO

Ronnie is writhing around now and the bag on the chest device
is dripping out green smoking fluid Ronnie is gasping for more
air and hes sweating

INNER CITY NIGHT

BOB
Dan
DAN
Yeah Bob
BOB
If we use Rileys box there and

tie into these lines using the negative
of our RZ patterns

DAN
Well interrupt the power every 15 minutes

BOB
This is what I meant

DEBORAH
Bobby What does it mean

DAN
It means that if the Detective can get
in there and find that triangulator we
can cut Hanks power by fifty percent
every fifteen minutes It may mean that
he will be clear enough to think and
act during that time

TERRY (excited)
I can use that time to try and untie
Hanks shoes

DAN
Whats that

DETECTIVE
Its a long story but if his shoes are
untied and if he knows it he might get
real mad and if he does itll cut his
power even more

BOB
Thats good

DAN
All right then Bob

Deborah and

I--along with Riley will try to get this

power interrupted for you

Terry

will try to untie Hanks shoes And
you find the triangulator and possibly
confront Hank When the power lowers
you will reverse the triangular

DEBORAH
And then what

RILEY

Itll be a whole new ball game if we

get that far

DETECTIVE

Lets go

DAN

Well get as close as possible to tap

in

TERRY

The Detective and I will go it alone

from there

BOB
Good luck to you

DETECTIVE

Good luck to us all

TERRY

ALL
OK

At night Ronnie is resting in his cot

OK

He has pillows stacked

up behind him and hes in a sitting position Hes dozing and
then waking then dozing The band members are getting dressed
up to go out They are wearing fancy black suits and fancy

shoes The room is all smakey from their cigarettes When Ronnie

wakes he calls out for Dan and Bob

RONNIE
Bob Dan

The rest of the band pays no attention

They continue to dress

When theyre finished they begin gathering at the door by
Ronnies bed Fred gets an idea and goes to his bass which is
leaning against the wall plugs it in then plugs Ronnie in
Ronnie is dozing again Suddenly Fred turns the controls on

his bass up full and hits it against the wall Ronnie bolts for-
ward and lets out a horrified painfilled scream Everyone
laughs Ronnie starts swallowing in a funny way

JOHNNY
Hey lets get outta here anyway I
cant breathe in here

AL
I cant breathe in here either Lets
go

They all file out They dont say goodbye or anything to
Ronnie Ronnie is left alone and he has been hurt by Freds
trick Hes trying to keep from vomiting and hes scared look-
ing he keeps swallowing and holding his throat Soon
though he vomits up a little blood His eyes tear up and he
cries

RONNIE
(crying softly)
Bob Dan

He tries to wipe off the blood from his bed He leans back con-
tinuing to cry softly alone in the room

Mr Barkos face close up Hes speaking on the telephone
His cigar is going up and down in his mouth Behind his sweaty
heavy face are venetian blinds

MR BARKO
Weve had a little trouble but hell

if it kills him Everyone thinks hes
slacked off Well just wait Hell

be there with bells on Ronnie Rocket

bastard will be there with bells on

The doctor is in with Ronnie Ronnie is asleep The doctor

lifts an eyelid and peers into the eye with a little light

The doctor then gives Ronnie a shot and then leaves the room
Ronnies warning signals goes off and he pulls himself to a
sitting position He gets his plug and spotting the nearest
outlet begins to crawl over to it He is just barely there when
four groupie girls sneak into his room Ronnie turns They
begin ooohing and ahhing as they circle him Ronnie lies helpless
by the wall The girls come in closer They begin to touch him
They keep saying his name RONNIE ROCKET over and over
again One of them gets bold enough to kiss him then the others
yell and giggle out let me let me Pretty soon they are
all pressed in on him kissing him and feeling him and showing
him their breasts

Just then the CLEANING LADY comes in to sweep and mop She spots
the girls all over Ronnie

CLEANING LADY
Get away from him get on out of
here OUT oOUT

She swings her mop at them and the girls go running out scream-—
ing The screams die off Ronnie again tries to plug himself
in but the cleaning lady is on him

CLEANING LADY

NIGHT - A marquee above the concert hall saying

RONNIE ROCKET
ELECTRA-CUTE

BIG SAX BAND
and BILL X

Inside the audience is loud and gets louder when the MC comes
out on stage

Backstage Mr Barko grabs Fred before he gets into position
with his bass

MR BARKO
I want him hot tonight dont be afraid
to goose him real good I mean it I

FRED
All right Mr Barko I will

He joins the band on stage The MC is just saying and now

Ronnie Rocket The curtain opens The audience screams
when they see Ronnie Johnny plugs him in Fred has the lever
set at five Johnny hits his guitar and Ronnie shoots a scream
spark forty feet into the audience The band begins to go
Ronnie twitches to the beat and makes his sounds When he begins
to falter his eyes-roll back and his head bounces up and down
and he falls down Fred knows to up the lever to a higher
number It now goes up to six Ronnies face shows pain We
get closer and closer to his pain-filled face

INNER CITY - NIGHT

The group of six Bob Dan Deborah Riley Terry and the Detec-
tive approach Hank Bartells Power Station which looms absolutely
gigantic in front of them Bloody knitting needles and pins
stick out all over each of them Surrounding the entrance to

the power station are hundreds of black coats donut men and

thin sick dogs The dogs are either gagging horribly or snarling
with teeth sticking out The closer the group gets the harder

it is for them to walk or talk

DETECTIVE
You guys better stop here and tap in-
or youll never be able to remember what
to do

BOB
Huh

TERRY
Beats me
DETECTIVE
Oh oh

The Detective reaches to each of them and jabs the needles in
deeper and harder He sees their glazed eyes focus once again

DETECTIVE
Tap in here you guys

DAN
OK

Dan Bob Deborah and Riley start to leave the group but the
black coats drive them back

DETECTIVE
Oh no

TERRY
Looks like Hank wants us all inside

BOB
We shoulda stayed back where we were

DETECTIVE
Too late now just keep those needles
killing ya with pain when we get in
» Same plan OK
ALL

OK

They enter the power station Tremendous electrical arcings
and humming sounds The light is very dim The groups starts
down a huge metal corridor and with each step the evil power

of Hank Bartells increases Soon only Terry and the Detective
can walk The rest of the group is zapped by the black coats
and carried through a small doorway off the corridor Donut
men appear laughing wildly with huge grins They follow behind
Terry and the Detective Soon Terry drops and hes carried off
by the donut men after they zap him with the electrical guns
Now the corridor is completely empty The lights are dimming
rapidly The Detective walks ahead slowly Fear is building
inside the Detective He senses a presence at the end of the
corridor Sweat begins to break out on his forehead As he
reaches the end a figure slowly emerges Hank Bartells

HANK
The Detective Ive been waiting
for you this is the night Ronald
dies

DETECTIVE
Well Ive been wallingeet ubol

MAIN CITY The concert continues

On the stage Electra-Cute is tap dancing and singing while

she glows Her glow begins to diminish so she tap dances over-
to Ronnie who is holding the microphone and screaming and gets
another jolt of electricity from him She lights up very bright
and the power of the jolt causes her to scream also and tap dance
very fast Ronnies box which Fred has is now up to seven

INNER CITY The Detective is facing Hank Bartells He struggles
to speak but cannot He turns suddenly and behind him is a
gigantic theater filled to capacity with thousands of men who
look like Hank Bartells They all wear black rimmed plastic
thick lensed glasses like Hanks Some carry circle banners
Behind them on the back wall is a giant symbol of a circle in
white neon light

Suddenly the Detective is on a stage in front of the vast audience
of Hank look-a-likes Black coats deposit Riley Bob Dan
Deborah and Terry on the floor of the stage The audience goes
wild No one including the Detective can stand up All writhe
spasmodically on the floor Dan and Bob try to work with Rileys
black box but all they can really do is drool and slobber on

it Now Hank Bartells enters the stage The audience applauds

and cheers until the sound thunders The Detective digs his
knitting needles in deeper but it does no good He can barely
focus his eyes Hank Bartells walks around the Detective

HANK
(loud to audience)
He can stand on one leg WATCH (to
Detective) Stand on one leg and Ill
bring the triangulator out to show you

The Detective writhes wildly on the floor He tries desperately
to stand on two legs let alone one but he cant The audience
again is wild

MAIN CITY The concert continues

The audience is wild Ronnie on the floor bleeding and scream-
ing

INNER CITY
Park turns to his audience of thousands of Hanks

HANK
(to audience)
He is a Detective He can give the Detec-
tives motto LISTEN (to Detective)
Say the Detectives motto and I will
let you turn the triangular Here is
the triangulator now

Suddenly moving across the stage is small stand on wheels

On top of the stand sits the triangulator It is a beautiful
device Actually it is made up of two triangles forming a dia-
mond shape At the points at either end two cords come out and
one at each end is plugged into the stand A big fat cord runs
off behind stage The triangulator is all that stands in the
way of success now but the evil power of Hank is overwhelming

HANK
(smiling to the Detective)
Can you turn it (he laughs)

The entire audience laughs hysterically as the Detective struggles
to say the motto

HANK
(to Detective)
Come stand on one leg say
the motto

The Detective is upside down standing on his head His legs
bend in a multitude of impossible positions His arms flip and
twist into knots He cannot speak Only garble comes out

Hank now motions to an orchestra in the pit below the stage
This orchestra is the same one from the circle club They begin
to play a strange rhythmic dining music in time with the Detec-
tive garble and physical spasms like a modern dance in hell

The audience of Hanks laughs hysterically

HANK
(to Detective)
Look

Hank raises his hands and he shoots lightening bolts with a
thunder clap sound which rocks the stage The back curtains

open revealing a wall of fire two hundred feet high Inside

the fire thousands of souls scream silently for help The Detec-
tive tries to focus on this horror He tries to scream Across
the stage the fire causes Deborah to flip over onto Bob Their
lips meet Bobs eyes focus
BOB
Where are we

DEBORAH
I dont know I thought I was dead
BOB
Your kiss your love it saved
me Kiss Dan we have to hurry

Deborahs flies over and kisses the gyrating Dan

DAN
What Oh What Oh Wheres the
box

BOB
Stay right with us Deborah Kiss
Riley

She kisses Riley and he awakes at least as awake as they are
which isnt much considering Hanks continuing horror power
Riley fishes the black box out from under his shirt Bob finds
a section of the fat wire coming off the triangulator and taps
in Dan Bob Deborah and Riley all cling to each other
Deborah kisses each of them constantly to keep them conscious
Dan adjusts the black box for the negative RZ pattern They
watch the Detective and wait

MAIN CITY Concert

On the stage now Fred is putting the needle up to eight because
there is some movement at eight Mr Barko cant stand watching
anymore and comes out on stage--behind the equipment catches
Freds attention and Fred gives him the box Mr Barko immedia-
tely shoves the levers to the highest at ten Ronnie starts
vibrating and bleeding and screaming then gets up but just holds
on to the microphone screaming

INNER CITY

Terry is struggling to focus on the shoes of Hank Bartells

He sees to his horror that not only are Hanks shoes tied but
they are double tied He crawls about under Hanks nose trying
to untie the laces of at least one of the shoes Hank laughs
at Terrys antics He thinks Terry is trying to stop him from
tormenting his friend the Detective

HANK
You are trying to keep me from your friend

here you are a nuisance so
I will kill you both (then more
strange laughter) Watch the floor

At this the floor begins to slide steadily toward the wall of
fire and the screaming burning multitudes beyond

HANK

(to Detective)
Hurry Soon the floor will move you
to the fire where you will die the death
For you I will make you into a
dog bone and my dogs will feed on you
for 100 years See yourself as a dog
bone

The Detective looks up Now the wall of flames becomes trans-
parent--barely perceptible Behind the flames he now sees him-
self Gigantic White Bone Parts of him are chewn away
Forty or fifty small sickening little dogs chew feverishly on
his dog bone body

MAIN CITY Concert

Mr Barko runs the lever down a bit then back up Ronnie is
still screaming The music is intense Ronnie falls over as
Mr Barko brings the lever down then he goes up when the lever
goes up ElectraCute is running a little low now and she dances
over to get another shock from Ronnie Fred looks at the lever
at ten then at Electra-Cute but yells at her too late She
touches Ronnie and the power blows her across the stage and she
turns into a black burnt cinder in a dress The music seems

to get louder then and the crowd roars

INNER CITY

The audience is applauding and now stamping their feet The
fire has returned It burns even hotter The souls tormented
crying is now audible The moving floor has now brought the
Detective and his friends closer to the end of the stage and
their final fall into the sea of fire

Terrys sore is bleeding profusely where he is jabbing at it
The pain intensifies and his eyes focus His fingers dart out
around Hanks feet--busily untying Hanks shoelaces Hank takes
delight in stamping on Terrys fingers but the pain it causes
only helps Terry After one very hard stamp (probably snapping
some delicate finger bones in Terrys hands) the audience laughs
uproariously

TERRY
(under his breath)
Thank you Hank between you stamping

and my bleeding sore I am able to do
my work HA HA

Bob Dan Deborah and Riley are still clinging to each other

BOB
Any minute now there should be a notice-
able decrease in Hanks power

DAN
Itll only last a second or two the
Detective has to be ready to take advant-—
age of it

RILEY

Look Terry has got one lace untied
DEBORAH

Its getting hotter my darlings Will

we be in time Remember I love

you boys with all my heart

This is the way I believe--Love is the
most beautiful thing

MAIN CITY - NIGHT CONCERT

The Big Sax Band plays heavy music Ronnies head bangs up and
down on the floor bleeding

INNER CITY

Hank Bartells jumps toward the Detective and now he makes his
head change into the head of a dog He growls and moans With
the audience cheering Hank raises his fingers and blows open
the Detectives chest with electric power

DEBORAH
No No

THE DETECTIVE IS SO DISTORTED NOW HE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE RONNIE
LOOKED IN THE HOSPITAL BASEMENT Inside the Detectives chest

his heart is pounding Smoke billows out the souls in the fire
scream now very loud The floor is moving the Detective danger-
ously close to the fire The Detectives eye roll about desper-
ately trying to focus His lungs are wheezing His veins and
arteries pounding along with his swollen smoking heart Sweat

is pouring off his brow Hank changes back to Hank and smiles
close to the Detectives face The Detective struggles to turn
away His eyes focus on something deep within the oncoming fire
He struggles to see and then it finally becomes clear He sees
Diana within the fire She sees him He screams He head turns
in anger to Hank Bartells His eyes roll to Terry His brain
perceives that Hanks shoelaces are untied He swings his ever
so heavy head and he sees the black box all tapped in Bob Dan
Deborah and Riley waiting in a huddle for the right time He
sees the fire looming close He hears the power of the elect-—

ricity the screams of Ronnie The screams and soundings of the
audience The swelling sound of the twisted music from the ulti-
mate discordant orchestra He sees DIANA He sees RONNIE

Now instantly the power drops Hank turns--stunned The Detec-
tive tries to remember what to do Terry waits Bob Dan Deborah
and Riley wait

Suddenly

DETECTIVE
HEY HANK I YOUR SHOE LACES ARE UNTIED

Hank looks down He sees As his head comes up the loudest
yell imaginable rushes forth from his mouth Also fire shoots
out with this yell The fire burns outward cutting a swath
through the audience of Hanks (killing many of them) and ending
by blowing a huge hole in the circumference of the giant glowing
circle symbol in the back of the theatre

The Detective lurches forward and grabs the triangulator He
grasps it firmly His friends watch with profound relief as
he turns the triangular perfectly so that all the electricity
in the city is reversed There is a nice solid click as the
new position locks

There is silence A pause Then Hanks head falls off
Then he collapses A wind blows all the Hank audience away to
darkness and moaning

The fire turns to white light Light radiates The souls begin
to float

The orchestra music becomes perfection The music is beautiful
and powerful
In a powerful rhythm lights begin to pop on outside destroying
the darkness and destroying the donut men and the black coats
They burst into flame and become part of the new light

The Detective (now looking very good and normal) Terry Bob
Dan Deborah and Riley all stand Smile Diana floats out of
the light toward the Detective a happy smile of love

The city lights up with a golden morning light from a gigantic
new sun

Ronnie glows white hot on the stage and floats up The crowd
chants Ronnie Rocket - some yell hes floating hes
hes

The Band and all around him disappears in golden white light

Ronnie floats up golden in space

The Detective Terry Bob Dan Deborah Diana Riley all float
and merge inside of Ronnie

The whole city is golden inside of Ronnie

Ronnie sings his love song

Roniiie is a golden egg

The egg appears in a room now The room has an ocean for a
floor In the room many tiny golden eggs float A small girl
sits on her fathers lap We see the strangely beautiful girl
but the fathers back is to us

LITTLE GIRL
Father when will all the new uni-
verses be born

FATHER
Soon and when they are Im going
to get you a great big chocolate to cele-
brate
LITTLE GIRL
Oh Father really

She hugs him And as they get up to leave
We love with one little golden egg across the room to a blue
lady with four arms who is doing a strange dance on a lilly pad
One arm stops dancing and reaches out A finger touches the
one little golden egg The woman smiles and laughs

BLUE WOMAN
Ronnie Rocket

THE END
