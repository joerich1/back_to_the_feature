trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas

DANNY

The weasel continues to gnaw

POOH-BEAR
He dont believe you Big Bill

BIG BILL

Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half
an
inch

THE WEASEL bolts for the opening gnashing its teeth trying to squirm
through

POOH-BEAR
You got something to tell Captain
Steubing youd better do it now
The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas

Danny uses the diversion He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own
jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILLS JACKET between
the coat and the lining

No one notices

Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more The weasel is able to get
his
head through the hole He bares his filthy teeth

DANNY

shorting Pooh-Bear settin up his
own stuff on the side

Thats a pack of discharge

Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear who listens intently

DANNY
Its true Jimmy saw him flashing a
pimp role at a bar the other night
said he was dissin your ass in front
of one of your customers

Pooh-Bear rises slowly Approaches the triumvirate
Danny keeps one eye on
the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening
POOH-BEAR
Manll say a lot of thing when hes
sporting weasel food for a pecker

LITTLE BILL
Damn straight
POOH-BEAR

Pooh-Bear limply aims the 45 at Little Bill

POOH-BEAR (contd)
Big Bill

Big Bill pats Little Bill down
LITTLE BILL
(holding up his arms)
Go ahead I got nothing to hide
Big Bill checks all of Little Bills pockets coming up empty

The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole

DANNY
Can I pull my dick out

Danny panicked eyes the hole in the pea coat

BIG BILL
Hes clean

Danny cant believe it But when Little Bill lowers his arms a big
roll of cash protrudes from the hole

Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately

LITTLE BILL
What

He follows their gaze to the cash

DANNY

conveniently forget that it was drug
dealers who killed my daughter

She is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall She
clings tightly to the curtains her hands shaking violently

start to head out the front door when

one of the curtain rings breaks with a METALLIC TING
ON DANNY - freaking His eyes shooting back to Liz
SILENCE
Listening

Then the CREAKING FOOTSTEPS of Intruder One approaching It takes an
eternity

Liz cant possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is
staring directly at him her body rigid with fear
Danny grabs the wrench again Tries to get to his feet but slips back
down either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared His
hand is shaking violently

He looks through the hole again

Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me
DANNY starts chuckling Looks up at Tanner
DANNY
It doesnt matter

Danny looks down at the syringe again Tanner sees it too

TANNER
Too late to be a hero

Danny picks up the syringe
Tanner pulls the trigger

INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs
forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK

THE GUN IS EMPTY
DANNY

Ten it is

Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNERS THROAT all the way down to the
plunger dosing him with the meth

Tanner goes down blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe
His eyes roll back as he convulses from the drugs

Danny struggles to his feet

Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in
the throws of a holy possession

Danny pulls the syringe from Tanners throat A LONG WET WEEZE
ESCAPES
Suddenly A NOISE BEHIND DANNY

Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny rocking slightly
back and forth a bullet hole in his cheekbone He looks brain dead

Danny doesnt move TANNER STILL WHEEZING

Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun but cant He keeps
looking down at his hand trying to get it to obey

Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti

Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood He
looks down at his hand

He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with

Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny TANNERS WHEEZING
CONTINUES

DANNY
(softly)
Youre dead

Garcetti nods slightly He goes to a kneeling position then curls up
on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies

Danny goes over to the couch and sits down
Danny with his head in his hands emotionally and physically
exhausted

TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER

CLOSE ON DANNYS FACE Blank Devoid of anything He stuffs
Garcettis gun into his own mouth hand shaking

He takes the gun out

Stuffs it back in again shoving it way down almost gagging on it
The barrel clatters against his teeth He takes it out again THE
WHEEZING CONTINUES

Danny starts crying Lifts the gun halfway again then drops it

He jumps up Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his
clip into him When the clip is spent Danny keeps pulling the
trigger

over and over again

He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and
again

FADE OUT
FADE IN

INT RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny dressed in his Tom clothes He limps over to the bed and picks
up the trumpet case Carries it over to the mirror

Danny staring at his reflection He lights a cigarette

He shoots Danny in the stomach Danny slumps to the floor His
cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed

Colette freaks

COLETTE

forming on his blanched face He looks at Colette with a wry smile

DANNY

Danny looks down at his bloody stomach

COLETTE

Danny stares at her not sure what to believe He looks over at
Quincey

DANNY

taken

DANNY

UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES The fire spreads quickly

QUINCEY

Quincey grabs her arm

head
QUINCEY

DANNY

COLETTE

DANNY
Your daughter needs you Go

The fire continues to spread Colette kisses Danny on the lips
Quincey pulls her away

Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door
cutting off any escape

Danny breathing hard He gets up Staggers over to the mirror where
his trumpet is

He opens the case and takes the trumpet out

He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES He stops for a second
a smile on his lips

He starts to play SAETA
DISSOLVE TO
INT BURNING ROOM - NIGHT

Back to the opening scene The whole room ablaze Danny lying on the
bed playing the horn

DANNY (VO)
So what is it Who am I after its
all said and done

Pieces of the roof start falling in

DANNY (contd)
Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne
(beat)
Avenging angel or plain old Judas

He stops playing
DANNY (contd)

(weakly)
You decide friend You decide
He closes his eyes

DANNY (contd)
Im too tired so you decide

He drops his trumpet and lays his head back
CuT TO
BLACK SCREEN
THEN BLURRY VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames
CLOSE ON DANNYS HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room

DANNY (VO)
Oh shit What is this

Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway
Dannys eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float

DANNY (contd)
Am I dead

A linoleum floor rushes underneath

DANNY (contd)
Linoleum This must be hell

Danny head sags finds himself staring at
A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF The tattoo smiles and speaks
TATTO
(warped distorted)
Hang in there buddy
Stairs rush by underneath Then another hallway

DANNYS POV - a bright white light at the end of the hall

DANNY (contd)
Oh no What a fucking cliché

On Dannys face floating through the hall His eyes fluttering
MOVING TOWARDS the light Closer Closer

Dannys eyes close his head droops
FADE TO
WHITE

CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open
DANNYS POV - an image slowly coming into focus
JIMMY staring down at him with concern
Danny blinks his eyes again Looks up at
A PARAMEDIC working on him
Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy

Jimmy just sits there nodding his head a big shit-eating grin on his
face

The paramedic continues to work on Danny His eyes slowly close

FADE OUT
FADE IN

EXT THE CITY - DAY

Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop He looks like a
new
man

DANNY (V0O)

Well Ive had some time to think
about it and its pretty simple after
all I guess its like the man said -
Man is the measure of all things
I should know I ran the gamut
Avenging Angel Judas loving
husband prodigal son prince of
Denmark I was all of those things

(beat)
Tom Van Allen got his revenge
Good for Tom And Danny Flynne He
got gut-shot for being the low-life
rat that he was Sucks for him

(beat)
But as far as Im concerned theyre both dead

Danny looks through the window of the shop
Colette inside working the counter pouring coffee

DANNY (contd)
But what about this guy Who is he
Danny enters the shop

DANNY (contd)
To tell you the truth I dont know yet

INT COFFE SHOP - SAME
Danny takes a seat at the counter Colette turns and sees him

DANNY (contd)
But I like his chances

They stare at one another for a beat then smile Colette pours him
some coffee

DANNY (contd)
I really like his chances

They strike up a conversation as we
FADE OUT

THE END
