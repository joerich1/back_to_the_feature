FADE IN

INT RESIDENTIAL HOME - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

Two attractive TEENAGERS are on a living room couch A
blanket is over the teen boy’s lap -- the girl’s hand is
underneath thrusting away

The boy’s eyes are closed with contentment while the girl’s
eyes are nonchalantly on the TV A Cooking Show is on

GIRL
Gross

BOY
Hmmm

GIRL

I totally wouldn’t put that in my mouth

The boy’s breathing REALLY heavily now BEAMS HIT LIVING ROOM

Girl tries to remove her hand but the boy won’t let her

GIRL

BOY
Don’t make me think about dudes now

GIRL
I want my hand back

FOOTSTEPS are making their way to the front door

GIRL
Oh my god they’re coming

BOY

The boy is now closing in on ecstacy -- he definitely won’t
let her remove her hand now

CLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR KNOB AS IT TURNS --
Girl’s eyes GO WIDE FREEZE FRAME ON OUR GIRL -- CHLOE

CHLOE (VO)
Well what would you do --

SMASH CUT TO
INT AIRPLANE - FLYING IN AIR - DAY

Chloe’s alone on a plane staring out the window in deep
thought --

me Mom ships me off to Siberia AKA The
Midwest -- like Dad and his child bride

Feeling eyes on her Chloe is startled to find a LITTLE GIRL
with glasses staring from the seat ahead She’s looking at
Chloe with an intense disapproving gaze

CHLOE
You’re creepy

Little girl starts to bawl Her mother comforts her and
passengers look disapprovingly at Chloe

CHLOE (VO)
Well she was

CUT TO
INT FIRST UNITY CHURCH MIDDLE AMERICA - SUNDAY MORNING

Church is filling up with shiny happy (and white) people
Service is about to begin

ANGLE ON best-friends HEATHER (wholesome light brown hair
16) and GRACE (blond knock-out sexy and pure - a walking
dichotomy)

Girls eyes are on SOMEONE a few rows ahead --

HEATHER
(sotto)
- She has that “I don’t give a flying
fig” sorta look I’d kill for that look

GRACE
Heather
HEATHER
Well she does Boys probably like that
huh

(off Grace’s look)
Not like I’d care or anything

GRACE
I think she’s pretty I love new people
I hope she likes us

HEATHER
Me too

ANGLE ON CHLOE reading the book “I Don’t Want to Talk About

It” Feeling eyes on her she turns back to see cheerful
Heather and Grace eagerly waving Chloe blanches
CHLOE

This place is waay creepy

Her father RANDY (fifty-something large man with kind
eyes) is at her side --

RANDY
Is there anything you like Chloe

CHLOE
I like LA I want to go home

TRISTA (AKA “child-bride” - actually late 20s) cheerfully
pops into scene (sitting on Randy’s other side)

TRISTA
This is your home now

CHLOE
Goody

Trista retreats Randy frowns put off by his daughter

RANDY
Be nice She means well

Chloe goes back to her book mumbling --

CHLOE
What does she care She’s not even
related to me

RANDY
Give her a chance Give “us” a chance
(locking gaze with Chloe)
Cmon let’s have us a good day
TRISTA
I think you’re really going to love
Pastor James Chloe he’s waay cool

Chloe smiles sweetly -- a bit too sweetly though Trista
doesn’t “get it” but Randy does and looks concerned

CUT TO
INT SAME - MOMENTS LATER

PASTOR JAMES (50s) running up the middle aisle towards the
altar slapping hands along the way He’s got a manic energy
about him as he addresses his congregation --

PASTOR JAMES
Maaaaan Don’t you just love the
atmosphere in here Atmosphere That’s
where it’s at And what makes the
atmosphere in here so different from the
atmosphere out there Is it the love in
the room or the love in our hearts
Think about that for a moment

And the congregation does dutifully closing their eyes
Chloe is like WTF

PASTOR JAMES
- don’t you know that YOU become the
atmosphere YOU are in You hang out with
the wrong sorta folk you ARE the wrong
sorta folk Here at First Unity we’re
all about atmosphere The right kind of
atmosphere

Amens and applause from the excitable congregation

PASTOR JAMES
Speaking of which -- how excited are we
for this Saturday’s brunch And how
proud -- proud that our teen girls here
want to take a stand A stand for
PURITY

Heather and Grace beam WE PAN over to see the GIRLS PARENTS
grinning with pride

PASTOR JAMES
By making the ultimate pledge to their
Daddy’s -- that our little girls will
abstain from sex until marriage -- we at
First Unity can clearly say our children
have the right kind of atmosphere

The TEEN GIRLS excitedly jump up to applause Chloe is the
only girl who remains seated Seated and stunned
CHLOE
(to Randy)
What is he talking about

RANDY
Um the Purity Ball

TRISTA

You know what a Purity Ball is don’t

you It’s so much fun You get to get
all dressed up and you even get jewelry --
a ring of faith from your Daddy I can’t
believe you’ve never heard about them
they’re all the rage

CHLOE
Where

TRISTA
Here

Chloe stares at her father in horror
CHLOE
Don’t even --
(‘think about it’)
Randy exchanges a worried glance with Trista

INT CHURCH LOBBY - LATER

It’s post service and refreshments are being served Chloe
grabs a handful of Mother’s Cookies --

MAN’S VOICE
So you’re the new girl

Chloe turns around taking a hard swallow as her eyes fall on
a TOTAL HOT GUY (early to mid 20s)

CHLOE
Oh wow I mean hi Yeah I’m uh
‘new girl’

HOT GUY
Well welcome

Chloe holds onto his very cute grin --

ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM Randy and Pastor James
mid-conversation --

RANDY
« you don’t know my daughter Pastor
She’s got the will of a tiger and the
bite of a Tyrannosaurus
PASTOR JAMES
So you’re scared of her

RANDY
Yes Very And I also love her

PASTOR JAMES
You know what your job is then

BACK TO Chloe and Hot Guy Chloe is on full flirt-alert --
twirling hair giggling unnaturally loud etc

ANGLE ON Pastor James and Randy eyeing Chloe --
PASTOR JAMES
Youve got to get her to attend the ball
Before it’s too late
Randy frowns
BACK TO CHLOE AND HOT GUY
CHLOE
» don’t tell me you buy into this whole
chastity belt thing
HOT GUY

Well between you and me I do have some
differences with it

CHLOE
Yeah hello it’s called a ‘woman’s
choice’

HOT GUY

(twinkle in gaze)
And how old are you

CHLOE
Old enough

He laughs Chloe frowns Randy and Pastor James approach
(with Trista) --

PASTOR JAMES
I see Chloe you’ve met our Youth Pastor

CHLOE
Who
(realizinghorrified)
Him

Hot Guy (who will now be referred to as HOT PRIEST) nods --
CHLOE
Oh my god You should totally warn
people -- where’s your outfit

HOT PRIEST

The clerical collar I thought I’d go
cauz today

CHLOE
Jesus

RANDY
Chloe

TRISTA

She meant Jiminy Christmas

CHLOE
No I meant Jesus Christ If you can’t
say that in Church then what’s the
freakin’ point

ANGLE ACROSS THE ROOM Grace and Heather are staring over at
Chloe in shock --

GRACE
Did she just take the Lord’s name in
vain

HEATHER
I can’t believe she’s flirting with Hot
Priest

GRACE
She’s got a lot of nerve

HEATHER
I know I heard they sent her here
because of some boy She
(jerking motion with hand)

- him
GRACE
(furrowing brow)
Huh
HEATHER

You know
Heather continues the jerking motions
GRACE

What does milking a cow have to do with
some boy
HEATHER
SHE WAS JERKING SOME BOY OFF

Everyone in the room stops and stares including Chloe

Heather and Grace’s faces are white with mortification A
beat then --

HEATHER
(intentionally loud)
-- and that’s why my parents don’t let
me watch cable

Heather gives a weak grin as Chloe’s gaze angrily zeros in on
them

INT CHLOE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Chloe’s on her bed yacking on the phone (Note the room
looks sad and sparse Chloe’s bags are still packed)

CHLOE
- I’m telling you he’s TOTALLY into
me

WE SEE Randy hovering at the door listening in
CHLOE
(continuing to phone)
How many points d’ya think I get for a
man of the cloth

Chloe cackles That’s it Randy enters upset -

RANDY
I need to talk to you
CHLOE
(eye roll)

I’m on the phone

RANDY
Now

INT KITCHEN - A BEAT LATER

Chloe’s staring impatiently at Randy who’s taking his anger
out on a crunchy bowl of cereal

CHLOE
(finally)
What

Randy stubbornly remains silent Trista takes over --
TRISTA
Your father wants you to go to the ball

CHLOE
The purity ball You’ve got to be
kidding me I’d rather stick needles in
my eye-balls I’d rather get my period
for an entire month and be forced to wear
white shorts I’d rather watch “Hannah
Montana” SOBER

Randy takes another frustrated bite of cereal

TRISTA
You don’t have to pledge Just go with
your father You might have a good time

CHLOE
What are you his lawyer

Chloe eyes her father whose response is yet another loud
bite

CHLOE
This is totally ridiculous I’m like
the last person in the world who should
be going to this thing I’d be a total
hypocrite I’m so never gonna do it
yknow

Trista stares at Randy with real concern
CHLOE
Unless there’s some kind of incentive

program

This makes Randy put down his spoon Father and daughter
finally connect

SMASH CUT TO
EXT HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT- MORNING
EDGY ALT MUSIC BLASTING -- Chloe drives up to school in a
brand new Mini-Cooper She’s got the coolest (and newest)

car in school

Heather and Grace are being dropped off by their respective
parents and eye Chloe jealously --

HEATHERGRACE
Luckyyy

INT HIGH SCHOOL - ENTRANCE - MORNING

Chloe walks up to the front entrance but is blocked by a
GROUP OF KIDS (nerdy boys) chanting --

GROUP
Trent Taylor sucks Trent Taylor sucks

They angrily hurl a few CD’s onto the ground

CLOSE ON THE CD PHOTO of a sexy and smoldering TRENT TAYLOR
(17 blond boy-band good looks) Titled “Today is Our Day”

GROUP LEADER
Is that it for the CD’s

The group nods staring nervously at one another’s iPods
With a reluctant sigh one boy tosses his in and the rest
follow stomping and destroying their expensive iPods

GROUP

Trent Taylor sucks Trent Taylor sucks
CHLOE

Why are you all going ape-shit over Trent

Taylor

GROUP LEADER
His is the devil’s music

CHLOE
Jump-back

The group stares at her oddly

CHLOE
Footnoting “Footloose” here You should
check it out it was on cable last week
It’s like your life story

ANOTHER KID
This situation is highly personal for us
Trent’s from here and we used to be proud
of him But this --
(re sexy CD cover)
-- it’s just not right He should be a
better influence

CHLOE
Yeah like you guys

Chloe leaves making the kids think for a beat before they go
back to stomping on their iPods

ANGLE ON GRACE AND HEATHER a few yards away watching Chloe

GRACE
I bet she’s allowed to listen to Trent
Taylor

HEATHER

Shes practically fornicated I’m sure
she’s allowed to listen to Trent Taylor

GRACE
You don’t think she’s actually done “it”
do you

HEATHER

You heard Pastor James it’s all about
hanging with the right sort

GRACE
Speaking of which

Grace eyes a very clean-cut teen boy RICHARD approaching
Richard and Heather lock gazes Grace rolls her eyes --

GRACE
Go ahead

Richard slowly leans in Heather feels his hot sweet breath
on her cheek Heaven Then --

He kisses her forehead Ewww Heather looks a bit crushed

RICHARD
What are you guys doing Stalking the
new girl Thinking about dragging her
off to your gala

GRACE
Maybe she’11 come willingly

RICHARD
Why would anyone want to do that

HEATHER
Richard
(to Grace embarrassed)
He’s just playing Richard’s totally
supportive of me pledging right baby

RICHARD
I’m supportive of you

GRACE
How sweet

HEATHER

He is he’s the sweetest boyfriend

The intensity between the couple grows just as THE BELL

HEATHER
I’1ll catch up with you Gracie

Grace a bit reluctantly goes Richard then grabs Heather’s
hand and pulls her --

INT HIGH-SCHOOL - HALLWAY - BEAT LATER

hands all over her -- this is a whole new Heather

CUT TO
INT SAME - BEAT LATER

Class schedule in hand Chloe is wandering the hallways She
opens a door assuming it’s her classroom and is assaulted
by a COUPLE MACKING in a supply closet

A freaked out Chloe screams as a frightened Richard quickly
removes his hand from Heather’s blouse and SPLITS

CHLOE
My eyes my eyes Eww to like the 35th
degree You guys were practically doing
it

HEATHER
D-Doing what -- me N-n-no way

Heather tries to button her blouse and escape but drops her
books in the process --

CHLOE
Yeah waay Wait a minute You’re that
holier-than-thou girl from church

HEATHER
(near tears)
Don’t tell Grace

CHLOE
The pretty blond

Heather nods Chloe sighs helping her gather the books

HEATHER
She’s my best friend She’s really got
the pure thing down I doubt she’s even
kissed a boy Doing the right thing
comes easy for her
CHLOE
What about for you

Heather can’t answer The LAST BELL RINGS

HEATHER
I gotta go I’m late for class

Heather runs off

CHLOE

respectively are nearby proudly beaming

JANET
Well go on now try them on

The girls excitedly head into their dressing rooms

JANET

Those gowns are gonna set us back a small

fortune

MARY-ANNE

Look at it this way hopefully it’ll be a

replacement for the prom

JANET
If all goes well

MARY-ANNE
Still worried about the boyfriend

Janet gives a nervous nod

Our Moms

MARY-ANNE

Mary-Anne suppresses a grin

MARY-ANNE

They sigh remembering the wild days of their youth
ANGLE ON Grace and Heather exiting the dressing room in
their tight-fittingcleavage enhancing white gowns They
look like slutty virgins

HEATHER
I love your dress

GRACE
I love yours

They’re practically identical
INT SAME - FRONT ENTRANCE AREA - SAME TIME
Trista enters the boutique dragging Chloe behind

CHLOE
This looks like a bridal shoppe

TRISTA
It is But it’s also the place to get
your purity gown
(pulling a frilly pink dress)
What about this one

Chloe blanches Her gaze goes to the back of the boutique
where Heather and Grace are admiring themselves in front of a
full length mirror

CHLOE
That girl is a total slut

TRISTA
(following Chloe’s gaze)
Who Heather Davis Chloe it’s not
nice to say such things especially when
they’re untrue

CHLOE
I get it This town ain’t big enough for
two sluts

TRISTA
(hurting for her)
Chloe
CHLOE

Cmon that’s how everyone sees me

Trista stops and makes Chloe look in a mirror Chloe looks
like your normal 16 year old girl

TRISTA
I see Chloe Chloe Miller And
that’s what I want everyone else to see

CHLOE
And you think the only way people are
gonna ‘see me’ is if I make some stupid
pledge that I’m gonna stop having ‘sexual
relations’

TRISTA
The pledge is about waiting -- waiting
until it’s right

CHLOE
Did you and my Dad wait

Trista pauses

TRISTA
I’m almost thirty

CHLOE
Yeah I’m almost twenty 112 in dog
years Want me to do your math

TRISTA
No
(serious)
(MORE)

TRISTA (CONTD)
And if you really must know We did
wait

CHLOE
Yeah until my parent’s divorce papers
were finalized
This hurts Trista and for a beat Chloe actually feels bad
ANGLE ON Janet and Mary-Anne curious eyes across the way --
MARY-ANNE
There’s Trista with her new step-child
I heard she’s a hand-full What do you
think they’re doing here

JANET
Looks like someone’s going to the ball

Overhearing last part Grace beams --

GRACE
New girl cCOOL

Grace grabs Heather’s hand dragging her over to Chloe
(While Trista walks over to the Moms)

GRACE
Hi I’m Grace

Nudging Heather who stares at the floor and mumbles --

HEATHER
Heather

CHLOE
Hey Heather y’know you totally look
familiar

Heather’s face turns bright red

GRACE
That’s cause we’ve been stalking you
We’ve wanted so much to introduce
ourselves but we kept on losing our
nerve Right Heath

Heather gives a small nod trying to avoid Chloe’s
threatening stare Grace eyes the gown Chloe’s holding

GRACE
Is that your dress PREETTY It’s so
awesome that you’re pledging with us

CHLOE
Whoa I’m just in for the rubbery
chicken Nothing in the deal memo says
anything about me having to pledge

GRACE
But that’s the whole point

CHLOE
My point’s to get a car

Chloe proudly gazes outside at her shiny new Mini-Cooper

CHLOE
The one good thing out of this whole
nightmare Back in LA I was grounded
for like an eternity and my Mom said I
was never gonna get a car Proved her
wrong

HEATHER
(envious)
Lucky

GRACE
(appalled)
Heather She’s doing all this for a car
Enter total wrong reason

CHLOE
What’s more All Americana than a little
blackmail

GRACE

It’s not in your heart
Chloe rolls her eyes

GRACE
Don’t roll your eyes at me

CHLOE

You want me to control my eye-balls talk
about control issues This whole town is
CREE-PY

(off Grace’s shocked look)
I’m just being honest here

(eyeing Heather)
In fact I bet I’m the most honest person
for like miles

GRACE
(beyond flustered)
Oh my gosh you are SOOOO Oh my GOSH
(to Heather)
(MORE)

GRACE (CONTD)
Say one of your snappy retorts my mind
is spacing

HEATHER
Um uh well Huh

CHLOE
I hope to god you’re not on the Debate
Team

GRACE

And I hope GOD forgives YOU
Grace grins feeling pretty good about her comeback

CHLOE
And I hope God forgives Heather

GRACE
(stunned)
Why would Heather need to be forgiven

Chloe shrugs with a grin Grace looks at Heather who is in
great inner turmoil here An excited Trista approaches --

TRISTA
Youll never guess what just happened

CHLOE
Space invaders came down and wiped out
Trent Taylor’s My Space page

TRISTA
Heather and Grace’s mom’s just put ina
call and got you invited to Samantha
Garrison’s purity ball pre-party tomorrow

OFF the three girls with the same pain-filled expression --
INT CHLOE’S HOME - RANDY’S STUDY - FRIDAY AFTERNOON

Randy’s at his desk and catches Chloe running down the stairs
toward the front door

RANDY
(calling to her)
You look very nice

Chloe double-backs entering her father’s study Despite
being dressed in a conservative sweater-set the essence of
Chloe still manages to shine through

CHLOE
Think I’ll fit in I hear Samantha
Garrison is super critical

RANDY
You’1l do just fine

Chloe eyes her father as he returns to the computer

CHLOE
So I’ve been doing a little research
about purity balls and guess what I found
out

A delighted Randy is all ears

CHLOE
Turns out it’s not just a one-sided
deal Dads also have to pledge that they
will be honorable to their family by
leading a “pure life” ie no
pornography

This is definitely news to Randy and he abruptly shuts his
laptop Chloe smirks

INT CRAIG’S CAR - DRIVING - AFTERNOON
CRAIG (40s) is at the wheel driving his daughter Heather

HEATHER
(on cell leaving message)
Hey it’s me I’m on my way to the pre-
party and uh just wanted to say “hey”
Hey Um Okay -- bye
(clicking off

CRAIG
What’s up with Robby

HEATHER
Dad that joke is so old

CRAIG
(fatherly grin)
How’s Richard

HEATHER
He’s okay I guess

CRAIG
(eyeing a worried Heather)
Listen if Ricky’s a keeper he won’t let
a little thing like your pledge get in
the way of you two

HEATHER
(eyes opening with horror)
You think that’s why he’s not calling me
back Because of the pledge

CRAIG
Uh no of course not Honey just focus
on tomorrow and how proud your Daddy’s
gonna be
Craig tries to muster a smile out of his worried daughter
INT CHLOE’S CAR - DRIVING - AFTERNOON

Stopped at a light Chloe sheds her good-girl sweater to
reveal a sexy tank top

The fathers beam with pride
EXT SAMANTHA GARRISON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Overhearing Chloe makes a face as she gets out of her car
and approaches the duo --

CHLOE
Princesses huh Y’know the Queen of
England must’ve been a princess once and
she looks like my Great Aunt Becky who’s
got this crazy-ass mole on her chin --
come to think of it it’s the same shape
as the UK -- anyway Great Aunt Becky
lives with her “best friend” Florence if
you get my drift

GRACE
We don’t ever want to get your drift and
we definitely don’t want to look like the
Queen of England

HEATHER
Yeah

GRACE
We want to look like a um a

HEATHER
(suddenly )
- a Disney cartoon

GRACE

HEATHER

GRACEHEATHER
(like Chloe’s an idiot)
So
They’re all now at the entrance of the house Chloe’s face
clouds as she takes in the sea of pink (ie TEEN GIRLS) who
are loudly gossiping and giggling

CHLOE
I hope someone in this house drinks

WE HEAR A LOUD WHISTLE BLOW --

GO TO
EXT SAMANTHA GARRISON’S BACKYARD - LATER
16-year old SAMANTHA GARRISON as she finishes blowing her

whistle She’s standing before a DOZEN TEEN GIRLS
(including Grace and Heather) Chloe is noticeably absent

The girls are all lined up FEET AND HANDS BOUND TOGETHER
looking like an out-take from “Saw VII”

SAMANTHA
--okay everyone LISTEN UP This next
purity game totally rocks It’s called
“WEDDING NIGHT” and it’s pretty simple
Whoever manages to get to bed first WINS

About twenty yards away high atop a platform is a lush
ultra romantic PRINCESS CANOPY BED

The girls eye it excitedly

Samantha BLOWS THE WHISTLE and THE GIRLS ARE OFF Hopping
their way towards the bed They try to get around an
OBSTACLE COURSE where LARGE BARRICADES are set-up each with
signs that read “PURITY FREEDOM” “WAIT FOR MR RIGHT NOT
MR RIGHT NOW” “BRISTOL PALIN IS NOT YOUR FUTURE”

Grace takes the lead and knocks down the last barricade which
reads “WORTH THE WAIT” Grinning she hops onto the
platform nearing the bed WHERE TO HER SURPRISE --

A geeky pimply-faced 12 YEAR OLD BOY (JEREMY) is lying on
top - awaiting and shirtless

Grace pales losing her balance --
Jeremy “romantically” catches her and won’t let go --

JEREMY
(near her rosy lips)
I‘1l wait for you Grace

GRACE
(horrified)
Please don’t

The competing girls all sigh as they catch up

SAMANTHA
Down Jeremy Sorry Grace that’s my
kid brother I wanted to get my cousin
who’s older and way hot but my mother
thought it’d be weird

CHLOE
(strolling up)
Yeah that’d be weird

Grace gives Chloe a slow burn

SAMANTHA
AND our winner -- GRACIE
(gifting with jelly bean jar)
Congratulations

CHLOE
Yeah congratulations ‘cause the next
time youll be in bed with a guy won’t be
for a lonnnnnnnng time

That’s it Grace gets upset and flustered --

GRACE
You are S-SUCH a a

Chloe is immensely enjoying Grace’s melt-down

GRACE
Why are you even here

CHLOE
Cause sixteen-years ago my father put his
Ding-a-Ling into my mother’s Cha Cha
which I believe is the point of this
little game here

Jeremy thinks this is hysterical while the delicate girls
react with horrified ewwws

CHLOE
Hey this is fun why are YOU here

GRACE
Why am I here Why am I HERE Because
my mother and my father fell in love got
married and had ME Oh yeah and they’re
still together I have a nice NORMAL

before the big pledge

GRACE
They can’t go they need they’re beauty
sleep

GIRL AT PARTY
Yeah so we can look like princesses

GRACE
Not to mention I hardly think a “hook-
up” is appropriate the night before one’s
purity ball

Grace stares down the girls

CHLOE
Ladies may I speak frankly How long
are you really going to wait Look at
those chicks on “Sex and The City” --
they’re like fifty now There’s a reason
they didn’t wait

HEATHER
They didn’t wait because they’re on
cable

CHLOE

That’s right I forgot you have a problem
with fiction and reality

(back to girls)
You guys deserve to see how the other
side -- ie the normal side -- lives
So let’s live it up and party hearty
Now who’s in

Another beat of hesitation then --

GIRLS
I am Iam I want to go

CHLOE
I can’t take all of you that’s too much
competition and I am only human

Grace looks crushed and defeated Heather turns to the
girls imploringly --

HEATHER
Guys you’re totally letting your
hormones get in the way

CHLOE
Now this she knows about

Heather throws Chloe a glare before continuing --

HEATHER
Think about our parents who have faith in
us And does going off with Chloe going
to some strange new club downtown with
loud music and hot older guys really
sound like that much fun

The girls look at one another -- um hell yeah

GRACE

I think you’re losing your audience

(to girls suddenly -- )
Remember what Pastor James told us It’s
all about the RIGHT KIND of environment
And believe me when I tell you all this --
Chloe Miller is the WRONG KIND of
environment

Even Grace is surprised by her sudden force

MATURE WOMAN’S VOICE
Here here

The girls look over to MRS GARRISON (tres conservative)
walking in She casts a disapproving glare at Chloe

MRS GARRISON
I knew I shouldn’t have let myself been
talked into this In my heart I knew a
leopard couldn’t change her spots much
less a City Girl change her wild-lusting
ways

CHLOE
Ya talkin’ to me

Mrs Garrison raises a serious eye-brow raise

CHLOE
(tucking away iPhone)
Listen I’m not making anyone do anything
they don’t want to do Um it’s all
good really

MRS GARRISON
I think I can speak for the mothers of
these fine innocent young girls when I
say that it is definitely NOT all good
We will not let our children listen to
this filth

CHLOE
Fine We won’t go to the club wait
what Huh

Mrs Garrison thrusts an ORANGE NEON FLYER under Chloe’s
nose Samantha grabs it --

SAMANTHA
It’s a flyer for Trent Taylor He’s in
town for a video shoot and there’s a
party at his crib
(to Mrs Garrison)
That means mansion

The girls excitedly whisper to one another Mrs Garrison
shoots them a severe look and they simmer down

CHLOE
Believe me Mrs Garrison if you knew
the music I was into you’d wish I
listened to this dweeb

MRS GARRISON
Youre saying this is not your flyer I
found it by the girl’s coats so
naturally

CHLOE
You thought it was mine Listen Mrs
Garrison like I said I

Chloe’s attention suddenly goes to Katie who’s looking rather
guilt ridden

CHLOE
-- I um love Trent Taylor I’m really
into guys who sing power ballads
Yknow non-threatening and sorta light
on his feet Yup that’s my kind of guy -
basically a girl

A very relieved Katie sends thankful looks to Chloe

CHLOE
Mrs Garrison it’s been real And it’s
even been sorta been fun But one thing
it definitely hasn’t been is --

HEATHER
-- real fun

Heather and Chloe connect Surprisingly Chloe leaves and
Heather shoots a guilty look at Grace

EXT SAMANTHA’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chloe is in her car slabbing on lip-gloss WHEN Grace and
Heather suddenly hop in --

CHLOE
Wh-what the --

GRACE
Just drive

CHLOE

Oh no You fools are not coming with
Talk about being a cooler

HEATHER
You need two hot girls and we were the
cutest girls at the party

She has a point

CHLOE
You guys are gonna go clubbing and be up
for anything

GRACE HEATHER
Um sure (a bit more eager)
Sure

CHLOE
Why

GRACE
We see potential in you
(off Chloe’s look)
That was a nice thing you did for Katie

CHLOE
Hyena-girl Shoot that was nothing

HEATHER
It was something
(a beat of connection)
You said you wanted us to see your world
well maybe you should see what we’re all
about Maybe we’re not that bad

GRACE
And maybe by the end of the night
youll want to pledge tomorrow

Grace is filled with genuine hope here

CHLOE
And maybe just maybe by the end of the
night you’ll both be having second
thoughts about pledging your life away

Chloe locks eyes with Heather who turns crimson Grace sees
this and looks concerned which only makes Chloe’s smirk grow

Chloe starts the ignition and THEY’RE OFF

CUT TO

INT CHLOE’S CAR - DRIVING - LATER

Chloe eyes Heather who’s next to her texting Richard

CHLOE
Listen don’t tell the guys you have a
boyfriend

HEATHER

Of course I’m going to tell “the guys” I
have a boyfriend

CHLOE
Well at least don’t bring up you’re
virgins

GRACE

(popping up from the back)
Of course we’re gonna tell them we’re
virgins

CHLOE
- and whatever you do don’t mention
the purity ball

GRACE
Of course we’re going to mention the
purity ball it’s tomorrow
(nudging Heather)

HEATHER
Yeah If it comes up --

An exasperated Chloe hands over a gigantic make-up bag

GRACE
What’s this
CHLOE
Make-up Smear it on cake it on

Just do something

Grace and Heather exchange “can you believe” looks as they
gingerly put on pink very shiny lip-gloss

GRACE
We’re not going to misrepresent ourselves
yknow -- Ooh this tastes like
strawberry shortcake

HEATHER
Mine tastes like vanilla cupcakes

Chloe rolls eyes reaching deep into her bag --

CHLOE
Put on black eye-liner or something You
guys look sixteen

GRACE
We are sixteen

CHLOE
These are college boys Do you want to
look like their kid sister

GRACE
I dunno maybe What if she were
really sweet and --

HEATHER
-- spent the summer in Africa helping
starving children

GRACE
I totally want to do that but do you
think they have starving children
somewhere less hot I burn easily

Chloe stares at the wholesome girls --
CHLOE
This is so not gonna work
(enter ideahitting wheel)

I know

Grace and Heather exchange nervous glances
CUT TO

EXT CHLOE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Chloe’s car is parked on a quiet residential street Grace
and Heather are alone in the car --

GRACE
I am not gonna change into one of her
slutty outfits
HEATHER
(busy texting)
Me either Unless it’s super cute

GRACE
I can’t believe I fibbed to Daddy I
never do that Maybe Mrs Garrisons
right -- a leopard can’t change her
spots

HEATHER
If you’re born with spots maybe that’s
the way you should be

GRACE
That’s so not the point of what we’re
trying to do here
(upset glance)
Oh my gosh stop texting Richard

HEATHER
I can’t help it He hasn’t contacted me
all day Don’t be mad but I care more
about saving my relationship than saving
Chloe

GRACE
What are you talking about

HEATHER
I need to see him before tomorrow and
Chloe’s the only one we know with a

car

GRACE
So that’s why we’re doing this -- for
Richard

HEATHER

For me Will you help me Gracie

The girls jump eyes landing on Chloe at the window --

CHLOE

Girls give each other “no way” looks

CHLOE

acceptable

INT CHLOE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Chloe is helping Grace and Heather climb in through the
second story window Grace eyes the room’s sparseness --

GRACE
This is your room
CHLOE
Yup -- lucky me huh It was the pilates

Chloe goes to her still packed suitcase holding out a skimpy
outfit --

HEATHER

size

Snap With that Chloe leaves the girls --

Heather has squeezed into the tube dress and looks
ridiculous

GRACE
I wonder what it’s like moving away
from all your friends your Mom and
having a new stepmother A cute new
stepmother Weird

HEATHER
Speaking of weird I wonder if Chloe’s
parents are into “weird” things

GRACE

Heather shrugs WHEN suddenly they hear TWO VOICES --

into the hallway and PEERS DOWNSTAIRS to DISCOVER --

Randy and Trista falling asleep watching Tyler Florence (a la
“The Food Network”) and a housewife on TV Hands deep in
ground chuck They’re making meatloaf dinner

Chloe rolls her eyes and returns to her room --
CHLOE

Heather and Grace in line The place is packed Heather
jerks her neck trying to see the counter

GRACE
-- I don’t understand why you’re
worried It’s not like you guys haven’t
talked about ‘it’

Heather is noticeably silent
GRACE

Heather You haven’t talked to Richard
about your pledge

HEATHER

I think he was hoping I’d change my mind
GRACE

He should know you better than that
HEATHER

Maybe he knows a different side of me
GRACE

There’s no different side of you Trust

me

Heather pauses Seeing a break in the crowd she pushes her
way forward

GRACE
I guess I’ll leave you guys alone

Heather doesn’t look back Grace leaves a bit forlorn
INT MARKET - CHECK-OUT COUNTER - SAME TIME

Chloe’s in line at the market A stack of familiar orange
neon flyers catch her eye She picks one up --

CLOSE FLYER -- “ARE U HOT and FUN JOIN US AT TRENT TAYLOR’S
CRIB AND BE AN EXTRA ON HIS NEW MUSIC VIDEO”

An ELDERLY LADY in line shudders --
ELDERLY WOMAN
That Trent Taylor used to be such a sweet
kid Every Sunday I’d hear him in the
Church Choir and that voice he sounded
like heaven
An obviously GAY YOUNG MAN in line speaks up --

GAY YOUNG MAN
And now he just looks like heaven

The elderly lady gives a not so subtle glare and goes
GAY YOUNG MAN
Like she wouldn’t have tapped some of
that back in the day
Chloe gives a weak smile

INT ICE CREAM JOINT - SAME TIME

Heathers finally near the front of the line She spots a
boy heading for the back room --

The kid turns around -- it’s not Richard Heather frowns
She turns to the girl at the counter (CLAIRE)

Heather gives a worried nod as Claire leans in --

INT MARKET - MAGAZINE SECTION - FEW MINUTES LATER

Grace is in the market hovering by the MAGAZINE RACK noting
that Chloe is safely off in the distance

ANGLE ON COUNTER

Alone Chloe eyes the pimply YOUNG MALE CLERK and places a
bottle of Peppermint Schnapps down with a suggestive grin
Clerk is stony faced

BACK TO MAGAZINE RACK

Grace is eyeing an ELLE MAGAZINE about to turn the cover
WHEN --—

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Hey

Grace jumps a good ten feet before her eyes rest on Heather

HEATHER
What’s wrong with you

GRACE
(avoiding eye contact)
Nothing What’d Richard have to say for

himself

HEATHER
He wasn’t there Apparently he took the
night off

GRACE

That’s weird He tells you everything
Now Heather’s avoiding Grace’s stare

GRACE
What’s wrong

HEATHER
Oh Grace you’re not gonna like this but
I’m totally gonna need your help
ANGLE ON COUNTER

Leaning in Chloe shows off her cleavage to the Clerk and
finally gets her grin

BACK TO MAGAZINE RACK

Grace has taken in what Heather just told her She doesn’t
look too happy

GRACE
That’s asking a lot Heather If my
parents found out they’d totally freak

HEATHER
I know I just have to see him before
tomorrow I’m so confused
(distracted by Elle cover)
Oh is that Gisele I love her

Heather moves to the magazine --

GRACE
Wait -- DON’T

Too late Heather opens the magazine to reveal another mag
hidden inside entitled “BALLS” A gorgeous half-naked man
is on the cover It’s obviously a gay men’s magazine --
obvious to everyone but our girls

HEATHER
Oh my gosh Grace

GRACE
I know I’m such a sinner but you have
a crazy thing you want to do before our
pledge I need something and and
(whispering)
I’ve never seen ‘it’

She indicates “Balls” with a shame-filled glance
GRACE

it On the count of three

TOGETHER

their eyes land on HOT PRIEST (in street clothes)

ANGLE ON COUNTER

Meanwhile Chloe plops another bottle of booze down Clerk
shakes his head No-dice Chloe gives a disappointed frown

BACK TO MAGAZINE RACK
Heather and Grace attempt to hide “BALLS” behind their backs

HOT PRIEST

HEATHER
(to Grace sotto)
It’s just like what they said it would
be

GRACE
(to Hot Priest)

Chloe reaches over and nonchalantly grabs one of Heathers
breasts

CHLOE
See Means nothing

HEATHER
It does too

Heather grabs one of Chloe’s boobs Grace joins in and soon
they’re all in an unusual cat-fight Make that BOOB-FIGHT

A CLEARING OF THE THROAT makes them stop HOT PRIEST is
standing before them having just exited a nearby store

HOT PRIEST

HEATHER
Ugh were fine We’re just worried
about woman-kind Aren’t we Grace

GRACE

good mean pinch

HEATHER

(to Chloe)
I hope we’ll be seeing you again

Heather and Grace crack up Chloe shoots them a glare

CHLOE

HOT PRIEST
As the Assistant Pastor I’m everywhere

Chloe eyes him pocketing a familiar orange flyer Her eyes
open wide --

CHLOE
Including Trent Taylor’s music video

GRACE
Of course he’s not going Trent Taylor
is hardly the right sort Right
Reverend

HOT PRIEST

He gives a mysterious grin to the girls
HOT PRIEST
But if I do go I’11 tell Richard you all
said ‘hello’ I imagine assisting on a

big music video will look pretty good on
his film school application eh

Heather gives an embarrassed nod
HOT PRIEST

night sleep Tomorrow’s a big day

With that Hot Priest gets in his car and goes Chloe zeros
in on Heather seeing the picture a bit more clearly now

Chloe’s cell phone suddenly rings She looks down --

Chloe hesitates and lets it go to voice-mail

HEATHER

He turns back to the girls wiping his mouth and grins --

Richard is helping the camera department pulling cable when
he’s approached by a very cute teen girl BECKY

BECKY

RICHARD

RICHARD
Except the Director And Trent

They share a laugh

RICHARD
Have I thanked you for recommending me

BECKY

helps Richard pull the cable and somehow makes this a very
sexy act Richard more than notices

EXT TRENT’S CRIB - BACKYARD - NIGHT

DIRECTOR
Playback ACTION

Dressed in a way cool suit and tie Trent is standing in the
middle of the SWIMMING POOL He sings to us looking like
he’s literally dancing on water (there’s planks below)

Ashley and Shelly are at his side singing back-up and
gyrating along with other sexy dancers

TRENT
Tell me how you like it
Guide my hand and let your sweetness take
me there
Thats how you like it
Show me girl and take me where you
wouldnt dare
You know you like it
Dont say maybe cause I aint playin’
girl
You know I want it
‘Cause Im the one whose meant to shine
your pearl

ON THIS we HEAR A SQUEAKY GATE OPEN and a very awkward Grace
enters followed by Chloe Heather and Drunk Kid

Annoyed at the distraction the Director yells --

DIRECTOR
CUT

He glares at Grace who’s locking eyes WITH --
TRENT TAYLOR

And suddenly Grace’s background (Chloe Heather and Drunk
Kid) LOSE FOCUS and so does Trent’s background (his dancers)

The only thing IN FOCUS is GRACE AND TRENT Mesmerized
Trent moves towards Grace He looks like he’s walking on
water

Grace is overcome And so is Trent It’s SO romantic And
yes wind is blowing in their perfectly moose’d hair

They’re very close Major eye-lock action going on here --

GRACE
s you’re not thinking I’m someone else

TRENT
(dancing eyes)
I know you’re not

GRACE
Or that we’ve met before
TRENT
I would have remembered What’s your
name
GRACE
Grace
He smiles
TRENT
‘For it is by grace you have been
saved’
GRACE

‘ through faith and this not from
yourselves’

TRENT
‘ it is the gift of God not by
works’

GRACE
‘ so that no one can boast’

They lock eyes then --

GRACETRENT
Ephesians 28-9

Trent moves to touch Grace’s sweet face She allows him for
a tender beat Then --

GRACE
(pulling away)
Youre making fun

TRENT
(stung)
I’m not like that Grace

GRACE
Youre Trent Taylor

And as soon as she says his name THE SPELL IS BROKEN A
blush of red heat strikes Grace’s face --

GRACE
Oh my gosh youre TRENT TAYLOR You ARE
like that

TRENT

Like what What do you mean
REALITY HITS AND EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO FOCUS SHARPLY

Chloe and Drunk Kid are standing with open mouths Heather
is pulling Grace away --

HEATHER
Oh my gosh Grace WHAT ARE YOU DOING

CHLOE
Yeah it looked like a bad outtake from
“High School Musical”

GRACE
More like “West Side Story”

TRENT
Exactly

They grin Okay they get one another A burly BODYGUARD
approaches --

BODYGUARD
Everything okay pal

TRENT
Everything’s great

Trent loses himself in Grace’s smile
HEATHER
Why are you flirting with the Anti-
Christ
TRENT
(offended)
Hey

BODYGUARD

A surprised Richard approaches
RICHARD

CHLOE
Searching for new expressions for

CUT TO

INT RANDY’S SUV - DRIVING - NIGHT

Randy’s behind the wheel driving Craig (Heather’s dad)
Vernon (Grace’s dad) who are noticeably quiet

RANDY
Listen I -- When we find our girls --
Chloe’s going to be grounded I assure
both of you that

VERNON
‘Grounded’ Well I should hope so
It’s almost nine o’clock I should be
tucking my Gracie into bed

CRAIG
You still tuck Grace in

VERNON
You know what I mean The last thing I
thought my daughter would be doing was
carousing around with the town --

Craig gives Vernon a warning look
RANDY
(eyes narrowing)
The town what

CRAIG
Um the town new kid

and

RANDY
That’s not a phrase

VERNON
I’ll give you a phrase

The men glare at each other

CRAIG
Guys this is not helping We’re all
upset Our little girls have lied to us
A bit out of character but they’re still
our girls

(a calming beat then - )

Perhaps Randy can advise us here since
he’s no doubt had more experience with
this sort of thing

Snap Randy’s grip tightens on the wheel
EXT TRENT’S CRIB - BACKYARD - NIGHT

The partyvideo-shoot has moved back inside the house
Heather and Richard are alone in the backyard

Look at you Hanging with new girl and
letting her make you over

Richard goes in for a kiss but Heather pulls back --

HEATHER
You totally lied to me

Richard groans

HEATHER
Richard

RICHARD
I’m sorry but I knew you wouldn’t
approve Not only will the gig look
great on my college transcripts but it’s
also excellent money

HEATHER
Why do you need money
(eyes light up)
The spring formal We’re getting a limo

RICHARD
Uh okay

HEATHER
(crushed)
Why do you need money then

RICHARD
Why do you always have to be the one with
the questions Why when I have

questions about important things -- like
us -- that I can never seem to get any
answers

Heather takes this in

HEATHER
What do you want to know
RICHARD
Are you really going through with it
What about --
HEATHER
(softly)
Yes
RICHARD
-- us
They lock eyes
RICHARD

So you’ve decided

Heather nods her head sadly Richard’s face goes dark

RICHARD
Thanks for letting your boyfriend know

Richard walks off Heather’s crestfallen

HEATHER

INT TRENT’S CRIB - NIGHT

Trent is being taught some new dance moves by his very SEXY
CHOREOGRAPHER though his eyes are planted ACROSS THE WAY --

ON a blushing GRACE Sitting on the stairs with Chloe

CHLOE

He’s totally into you It’s like a real
honest to goodness miracle
Grace

it’s so wrong and he’s so famous

CHLOE
Add it up together and it’s so right
GRACE
I couldn’t I just couldn’t And
besides -- why would he be into me

pauses expectantly In the history of sisterhood
all heard this familiar cue

CHLOE
Um uh well there’s No not
that Huh

sighs disgruntled Chloe finally relents --

CHLOE
Maybe the guy actually has good taste
There You totally owe me now

grins and the two have a sincere friendship moment

CHLOE
It’s like a once in a lifetime opp --
when you’re like sixty living ina
senior citizen home with no teeth --

GRACE
I won’t have teeth

CHLOE
Okay I’ll give you teeth The point is
youll look back and totally regret it
(off Grace pondering)
You totally should go for Trent Taylor

On this Heather approaches eyes blasting at Chloe --

HEATHER
What are you doing Don’t tell my
Gracie to go for Trent Taylor He’s
totally done in this town TOTALLY

The crowd of teen extras roar as Trent busts a sexy move

CHLOE
Yeah I can see that

HEATHER
I don’t know why we’re here in the first

place
(MORE)

HEATHER (CONTD)
(to Grace)
Let’s go

CHLOE
I take it your chat with Richard didn’t
go too well

HEATHER
There’s nothing to talk about I’m
pledging and Richard has nothing to do
with anything

CHLOE
Okay

HEATHER
- and don’t act like us coming here
tonight has ANYTHING to do with me You
wanted to see Hot Priest and he’s not
even here

CHLOE
I know Bummer I wonder where he is

HEATHER
Like you even have a chance with him
He’s like twenty-four and even if you
were the same age I’m sure the girls he
goes out with hold out for at least a
dinner

Ouch Grace feels for Chloe --
GRACE
That wasn’t very nice I’m sure Chloe
holds out for at least a meal right
Chloe grimaces We suddenly hear a LOUD FLIRTY LAUGH --
ANGLE ON Becky “working” alongside Richard
BACK TO SCENE Chloe’s wearing a smirk
CHLOE
Now I get why Richie-Boy didn’t tell you
about tonight
HEATHER
He didn’t tell me because he knows I
don’t approve of Trent Taylor
CHLOE
You sound more like Richard’s mother than
his girlfriend I bet Becky doesn’t
sound like his mother

Ouch part 2 Heather retreats stung

CHLOE
Hey I’m just saying what we’re all
thinking For instance --

Chloe glances at Grace who’s back dreamily staring at Trent

CHLOE
(a la thought bubble)
‘I wonder what he looks like without his
shirt’

ANGLE ON the director (rehearsing) CUING TRENT who suddenly
RIPS OPEN HIS SHIRT The crowd roars also on cue

BACK TO SCENE Grace sits up with a volt of energy

CHLOE
Oh my god this is so great Okay um
‘I wonder what he looks like without his
underw--’

HEATHER
ENOUGH Jesus Christ

GRACE
(snapping back)
Oh my GOD Heather

CHLOE
What happened to “Jiminy Cricket” and the
always popular “Oh my gosh”

HEATHER
You make us like insane

Heather gets up just as Drunk Kid staggers over clutching a
flask

DRUNK KID
(to Heather)
Hey where you goin’

HEATHER
And you -- you need to stop drinking
You seem like a nice boy and all but all
you do is drink and barf Drink and
barf Drink and barf What’s so fun
about that

CHLOE
It’s sorta fun to say ‘drink and barf’
‘drink and’

Heather shoots her a glare and storms off just as Trent
appears casting a very warm smile to Grace

TRENT
Hey I’m finally on a break Wanna take
a walk or something

Grace’s gaze is focused on Trent’s bare chest She’s
fighting something deep inside (um hormones)

INT MINI-MALL ICE CREAM JOINT - NIGHT

The place is closing up Randy and Vernon are seated alone
Randy is finishing up his ice-cream eyeing Vernon’s --

RANDY
You gonna eat that

VERNON
(pulling dessert close)
Maybe

Randy frowns as Craig approaches

CRAIG
Richard’s not working tonight
VERNON
Why wouldn’t the girls just call home
RANDY
Maybe Grace is seeing one of Richards
buddies
VERNON
Grace is not allowed to date
RANDY
Until when
VERNON

Ever
Randy laughs thinking he’s kidding He’s not

VERNON
Not much point in dating that’s what
tomorrow’s all about When Gracie’s
ready there’s marriage

RANDY
Jump-back

The guys stare at him

RANDY
Referencing “FootLoose” something my
daughter taught me The same daughter
who’s allowed to date and enjoy life

CRAIG
Maybe a little too much
(off Randy’s look)
I’m just saying

RANDY
You’re the one with the daughter who has
a boyfriend

CRAIG
Let’s not start The important thing is
finding our girls and bringing them home
(looking up to server)
Ill take some water please

The server Claire nods We recognize her as Richard’s
co-worker She’s overheard everything

CUT TO
EXT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
Trent and Grace are alone strolling around the corner from
the “crib” Though they’re not holding hands it’s still

sweet And a bit uncomfortable The perfect teen combo
Trent’s replaced his torn shirt with a simple plaid shirt

TRENT
So

GRACE
So

TRENT

So what do you do for fun Grace

GRACE
I dunno Not much There’s my Church
Theatre Group and Kids For Christ and of
course Singing for Jesus -- Spring
Recital is just around the corner -- so I
keep my Mondays sorta light Tuesday’s
are a different story I have to wake up
at 4am to feed the homeless but most of
them are asleep so it’s pretty painless
and then

Trent gives a small chuckle

GRACE
I know Lame huh

TRENT
Not at all You’re making me realize how
much I miss this town

GRACE
Well you won’t have to miss us You just
bought that fancy house

TRENT
Grace that’s not really my house that’s
a set My life’s one big movie set You
know what I need

GRACE
What

They’re now standing very close

TRENT
Some reality

He locks eyes and suddenly Grace reaches in and gives hima
passionate kiss Trent’s totally surprised but Grace isn’t

GRACE
I’m not going to apologize for that

TRENT
(delighted)
I’m not asking you to

GRACE
I know you’re not

She takes a brief glance at the heavens -- nothing happens
no lightning bolts Grace smiles and goes in for another
heavenly kiss

INT TRENT’S CRIB - SAME TIME

Richard approaches Heather who’s alone He’s wearing Trent’s
torn shirt and looking really hot

HEATHER
What happened to your shirt

RICHARD
Trent’s borrowing it He wanted to be a
real person on his walk with Grace

HEATHER
What walk with Grace

Richard hesitates eyeing Chloe approaching who overhearing
attempts to turn back --

HEATHER
You told me Gracie was in the restroom
praying for Trent’s soul

CHLOE
I said she’s doing something really
heavenly or uh along those lines

RICHARD
C’mon he seems like a good guy

HEATHER
He’s Trent Taylor Gracie’s father would
have a cardiac if he knew what his little
girl was up to

RICHARD
Sometimes in life you have to go with
what’s right for you not your family

HEATHER
Oh spare me your double meaning

Richard retreats stung Heather spots Becky approaching and
grabs Richard’s arm --

HEATHER
We need to talk

Heather drags Richard off

Chloe gives one final looksie at the party and frowns -- no
Hot Priest But there is Drunk Kid chugging from a plastic
cup She stares at him Then --

CHLOE
(grabbing him)
Flirt with me

INT TRENT’S CRIB - STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Dragging him UPSTAIRS they’re blocked by a bunch of partying
kids --

DRUNK KID
Maybe we should head back

CHLOE
I wanna make-out don’t you

DRUNK KID
Thing is -- my cup’s gettin’ sorta low

CHLOE
I hope that’s a metaphor

She eyes him as he literally licks the last drop from his
cup Chloe sighs And suddenly she hears a familiar loud
HORSEY LAUGH Chloe stops

DRUNK KID
Egads what’s that

Chloe looks DOWNSTAIRS --

Spotting a CLUSTER OF TEEN BOYS Horsey laugh is coming from
inside the circle

INT DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
Chloe rushes over breaking apart the boys to discover --

Yup Katie (red-head from pre-party) Flirting like mad
center of attention having a grand ol’ time

CHLOE
What the hell

KATIE
Oh my gosh Chloe What are you doing
here

CHLOE
Me I’m not the one whose career is her
virginity
The boys pick up on this and look confused --
KATIE
Shush

(pulling Chloe aside)
Please don’t ruin this for me

CHLOE
Ruin what

KATIE
I want to make-out with someone --
anyone

CHLOE

Talk about attainable goals

KATIE
Chloe you totally inspired me tonight
You inspired me to sneak out of my house
steal the keys to my grandmother’s car
and totally lie to everyone who loves and
cares about me

CHLOE
Really Little ol’ me
KATIE
I want to be like you -- at least for one

night

CHLOE
Sounds like a bad Celine Dion song

KATIE
Are there any good ones

Chloe cracks a grin and they share a bonding cackle

CHLOE
I like you kid

KATIE
For tonight we’re twins

At this moment HOT PRIEST walks through the front door
carrying a large pastry box

HOT PRIEST
(to kids)
Who wants snacks
Chloe’s eyes twinkle with interest

INT SAME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Hot Priest is behind a table filled with yummy looking
treats The kids are lining up

HOT PRIEST
Okay here’s the deal One bear-claw in
exchange for an illegal substance

A TEEN KID hands over a cigarette Hot Priest gives an eye-
brow raise and the kid sighs handing over the whole pack

HOT PRIEST
There you go

Hot Priest gives him a donut and a glass of milk Chloe
walks up

HOT PRIEST
Chloe What are you doing here

Chloe gives a flirty shrug

HOT PRIEST
Do your parents know you’re here

CHLOE
Do your parents know you’re here

HOT PRIEST
Unfortunately they don’t check in like
they used to

Chloe laughs a little too loudly and twirls her hair

CHLOE
Youre funny Say it’s really loud in
here wanna go for a drive or something
I have a really cool stereo

Hot Priest pauses realizing Chloe’s apparent crush

HOT PRIEST
That is really adorable

CHLOE
What

HOT PRIEST
You know what I think I think you
should go home and get a good night’s
rest tomorrow’s gonna be a big day

CHLOE
What are you my Dad

HOT PRIEST
More like hip young Uncle

Chloe frowns starting to get it Drunk Kid stumbles up
eyeing Chloe --

DRUNK KID
Hey what happened to making out
HOT PRIEST
I hope that’s a new show on Bravo
CHLOE
(edgy )
It’s not

Hot Priest gives a concerned gaze On this Gina (Trent’s
Mom) enters and Chloe’s face falls

GINA
I just put on a pot of coffee
(noticing Chloe)
Hi I’m Gina

CHLOE
And I’m going

She tugs on Drunk Kid

HOT PRIEST
Where are you going Chloe

CHLOE
Oh pleeze don’t act like you care
People act in this town like they know

you or something but it’s crap -- no
one knows anyone and no one cares about
anyone

DRUNK KID
Deep

HOT PRIEST

Sad And not true

CHLOE
Nice meeting you Gina

Chloe spits this out and leaves with a bewildered Drunk Kid

GINA
Someone’s a little jealous

HOT PRIEST
Someone’s hurting Big time

OFF Hot Priest’s concern --

chest through the torn shirt He notices and grins Then --

HEATHER

RICHARD

HEATHER
Not funny

He steps around the bed and pulls her to him --

RICHARD
I don’t love anyone but

She smiles

RICHARD

She teasingly slugs him and “attempts” to get away as he
takes her in his arms

HEATHER
Don’t talk about your mother at a time

RICHARD

Heather hesitates
HEATHER

Grabbing her clunky handbag she opens it and Richards eyes
GO WIDE as he peers inside --

INT TRENT’S CRIB - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Entering the party the Dads appalled eyes take in the kids

After bewildered looks the Dads follow the Director
INT TRENT’S CRIB - ENTRANCE - BEAT LATER

mind

Heather hesitates WHEN the door swings open The Assistant
Director pops in barely registering the situation

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

We need you on the set so um wrap up

A mortified Heather covers herself
INT TRENT’S CRIB - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Heading downstairs the Assistant Director tosses Trent’s
shirt to him Trent beseechingly turns to Grace --

TRENT

GRACE
Your torn shirt isn’t just an act It’s
there It’s real

TRENT
I’m not a torn shirt You gotta believe
me Grace

GRACE
I believe you but

Grace hesitates catching her reflection in the mirror She
looks like a sweet innocent All-American kid She frowns

GRACE
I don’t know if I can compete

TRENT
I don’t want you to that’s part of what
I like about you

GRACE
(sudden smile)
You like me

As they lock eyes a DRUNK GIRL staggers into scene --

DRUNK GIRL
DUH

-- and throws up into a large planter definitely destroying
the moment

EXT TRENT’S CRIB - BACKYARD - NIGHT

The Dads are sitting on director chairs outside the pool
cabana A bunch of 20-something sexy girls are swimming in
the pool Vernon looks away seemingly offended

CRAIG
Doesn’t hurt to look

VERNON
What about our end of the bargain

CRAIG
It’s hardly pornography they’re in their
bathing suits

We hear SQUEALS The Dads look over and yup the girls are
now topless This time Vernon can’t pry his eyes away

RANDY
(re Vernon)
Yup you’re going to hell

CRAIG
Geez Vernon get a grip

VERNON
(snapping out of it edgy)
I want to get out of here Our girls are
clearly not here -- thank goodness -- so

approaches --

helluva job

Cabana Now
INT TRENT’S CRIB - ANOTHER UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Half-a dozen young couples making-out in a dark room
upstairs Among them is Katie and a VERY CUTE TEEN BOY

CUTE BOY
(coming up for air)
Youre amazing Kathy I’m totally gonna
call you

KATIE
Really Thank you so much

PAN OVER TO the only couple not making-out -- Chloe and Drunk
Kid Chloe is carefully watching Katie

CHLOE
(blanching)
“Thank you” Did she just thank a boy
for maybe calling her

CUTE BOY
(in between kissing)
Kathy Kathy you’re SO awesome
CHLOE

Her name’s KATIE

KATIE
(coming up for air to Chloe)
He can call me Kathy
(turning back to Cute Boy)
I don’t mind Really

CUTE BOY
Thanks Kathy’s my ex I miss her

KATIE
Awwww

Chloe makes a disgusted face as the couple gets back to it
Chloe eyes Drunk Kid who’s busy devouring a sloppy chili-
burger

CHLOE
I can’t believe you’d rather make out
with that burger than with a cute girl

Frustrated she grabs Drunk Kid’s flask taking a swig --

CHLOE
Eeck What is this

DRUNK KID
Apple juice I actually don’t like the
taste of alcohol

CHLOE
What do you mean you’ve been drinking
all night You totally hurled before --

DRUNK KID
Bad sushi I eat a lot Growing boy

CHLOE
You’re not a drunk

DRUNK KID
And you’re not a slut

CHLOE
I never said I was a slut

DRUNK KID
I never said I was a drunk

CHLOE
You were acting like a drunk

DRUNK KID
And you were acting like a slut

CHLOE
(pausing then -- )
Why were you acting

DRUNK KID
I guess for the same reasons you are

CHLOE
Your parents got divorced and your Dad
ups and marries his perfect little
Pilates instructor who drags him to her
perfect little hometown And the
pathetic thing is he didn’t even tell me
about Trista or the move He said he
thought my Mom did Doesn’t even matter
because the fact is you can totally get
replaced in someone’s heart So you
gotta fill it first y’know

DRUNK KID
I’m really sorry

A beat of connection Then --
DRUNK KID
that your Dad does Pilates That’s
totally gay

CHLOE
You should see him in spandex

They share a laugh and a beat of connection

ANGLE ON Cute Boy’s hand is now working its way up Katie’s
shirt

CHLOE
(to Drunk Kid concerned)
Christ This is getting out of hand
Literally We gotta do something

DRUNK KID

Why
CHLOE

Cause I feel I feel

Chloe pokes her head back in She can barely breath but she
braves it and goes in --

CUT TO
INT TRENT’S CRIB - POOL SIDE CABANA - NIGHT
The cabana is dressed up like a Moroccan restaurant on

steroids The Dads are with other middle-aged Extras
sitting on big pillows

Craig think

ASHLEY
-So I had my little girl when I was

CHLOE
Her name’s KATIE and both of you guys --

She drags the boys out and locks the door --

A grinning Katie meets Chloe’s shocked-to-the-core gaze

You sure this is the way to the pool

DOOR OPENS and Shelly and Ashley walk in Dressed in
bikinis

SHELLY
Oh lookie it’s a prom
ASHLEY
I never went to prom
SHELLY
Pregnant
ASHLEY

No hung over Oh yeah I was also
pregnant -- kidding Actually I was
just drunk OFF MY ASS

Everyone’s hearing this and are justifiably appalled

SHELLY
(spotting Vernon)
Oh my gosh there’s that cute Extra
Yoohoo Vernon --

Mary-Anne hurls a disgusted glare at pasty-faced Vernon
Mrs Garrison is delighted at the spectacle

GRACE
(to Vernon)
There’s no such thing as Princes or
Princesses and this proves it

An overwhelmed Grace goes running for the EXIT JUST AS --

A MAGICAL FIGURE comes dashing in He’s dressed in Medieval
gear -- we’re talking tights a black cloak a red cape mask
and yes a sword Oh and he’s TRENT TAYLOR

JEREMY
(awestruck)
It’s VENGER PRINCE OF DARKNESS
(off blank stares)
Hello “Dungeons and Dragons” -- this dude
is a total bad-ass
ANGLE ON GRACE AND TRENT

GRACE
(delighted)
Prince
TRENT
It was the only thing they had
GRACE
I can’t believe you’re here
TRENT
I was going to call but I I didn’t

have the nerve

GRACE
The nerve for what

TRENT
For everything I totally want the
opportunity to get to know everything
about you Grace

GRACE
I’m just a silly girl from a silly little
town

TRENT

So am I Well not the girl part We’re
more alike than you think And I want
you to get to know that side of me

ANGLE ON TEEN GIRLS and Samantha whispering to one another --

GIRL 1
That guy is totally hot --

GIRL 2
-- check out his bulging --

SAMANTHA
-- biceps I know Wait a second Oh my
god it’s TRENT TAYLOR

Girls SCREAM in recognition and RACE OVER nearly trampling
poor Grace as they beg Trent for autographs Trent looks for
an okay from Grace who nods her head laughing --

Meanwhile Richard has snuck into the ballroom Heather is
overjoyed but his eyes are solely on her parents --

RICHARD
Mr and Mrs Davis I’m sorry about
everything -- last night -- and and

for us getting birth control pills
The sound of these words bring the room to a STANDSTILL

RICHARD
(loudly to Everyone)
Yes they were ours not Chloe’s

And there’s Chloe who with Hot Priest has just entered the
room

Randy’s gaze connects with his daughter There’s
understanding and relief there

RICHARD
(to Craig and Janet)
Heather didn’t want to lose me
(to Heather)
I’m sorry But know this -- you have me
I’m here No matter what

Heather smiles relieved and overjoyed
RICHARD
Oh and I don’t want to marry you
(to Chloe Hot Priest)
I thought it over
Heather shoots Chloe a bewildered look Chloe shrugs
RICHARD
But maybe probably someday When we’re
old

Heather brightens again Richard addresses everyone --

RICHARD
Oh and another thing Heather Davis is
most definitely still -- a VIRGIN

And no one is more thrilled than --

GRACE

Grace runs up to Heather enveloping her in a humongous hug

GRACE
Thank goodness I was so scared you were
a skank

HEATHER

And I was scared he was a skank
(eyeing Trent)
But he’s not

GRACE
We’re both skankless
They jump up and down like the BFF’s they are A TEEN GIRL
interrupts --

TEEN GIRL
You guys maybe but

She eyes Chloe who’s noticeably outside the circle Katie
runs up to them --

KATIE
That’s hurtful

HEATHER
Chloe’s not a skank

GRACE
Not even

CHLOE
‘Appreciate the character reference and
all but what if I have ‘done it’ What
then

Silence Then --

KATIE
You’re a good person

HEATHER
And a good friend

GRACE
And even if you’ve ‘done it’ it doesn’t
change that

The girls all connect Then --
CHLOE
Well for what it’s worth --
(loudly to EVERYONE)
I HAVENT
HEATHER
(floored)
Really You’re still one of us
Chloe nods Grace is overjoyed

GRACE
Oh I knew it I could always tell

The girls giggle and bond some more The guys approach --

TRENT
Chloe helped me find you Grace
RICHARD
(to Heather)
And covered for us She is good people

RANDY
(approaching)
That’s my girl

Randy brings Chloe in for a big fatherly hug Chloe doesn’t
resist Across the way her eyes connect with a very pleased
and proud Hot Priest

CUT TO
INT SAME - LATER

Just like a wedding Trent and Grace stand before Pastor
James Chloe and Heather are nearby supportive but clearly
not pledging Katie is with the girls who have already
pledged all holding white roses and looking virginal

TRENT
and I Trent Taylor promise to
remain pure in body mind and soul until
my wedded day

GRACE
Ditto

Vernon plants a sweet kiss on his daughter’s cheek and gives
her the promise ring He then shakes Trent’s hand clearly
approving of him and goes over and shakes Gina’s (Trent’s
mother) hand who has just arrived Shelly and Ashley dab
their misty eyes

INT SAME - LATER
MUSIC IS PLAYING

The mood’s much lighter festive Heather and Richard are on
the dance-floor while Trent is showing Pastor James how to
bust some moves Grace looks on having fun Chloe is off
to the side taking it all in

CHLOE (V0O)
Okay so maybe the town is not all that
bad And at the end of the day -- dont
you love when adults say this like
theres even a choice Its called night
-- Anyway ‘at the end of the day’ us
girls got to make our own choice and even
though I didnt pledge I got to keep my
car -- YAH() -- I also realized that
you can just hang with boys and not turn
it into something else Something that
Katie figured out a little too quickly --
ANGLE ON KATIE -- flirting with the pledged girls who are
clueless of the subtext Grandma looks on approvingly

CHLOE (VO)
-- so like I was saying time is on my
side and I guess I still have a lot to
figure out Make that weve got a lot to
figure out --

ANGEL ON HEATHER AND GRACE posing for a professional photo
They halt the process looking for someone --

-- yup Chloe who joins in flashing the Devil Rocker sign
and sticking out her tongue just as the photo is taken
Randy laughs getting a kick out of his daughter

CHLOE (VO)

forward to figuring it all out with my
new friends -- my gulp girlfriends --
