entering graveyard

Jacks Lament
Performed by Danny Elfman

There are few whod deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night

I excel without ever even trying

With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek

With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan

I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year its the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I Jack the Pumpkin King

Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh somewhere deep inside of these bones

An emptiness began to grow

Theres something out there far from my home
A longing that Ive never known

Im the master of fright and a demon of light
And Ill scare you right out of your pants

To a guy in Kentucky Im Mister Unlucky

And Im known throughout England and France

And since I am dead I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations

No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand

That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown if they only understood
Hed give it all up if he only could

Oh theres an empty place in my bones

That calls out for something unknown

The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears

leaving graveyard and entering forest

SALLY
Jack I know how you feel

Sally gathers herbs
back at Dr Finkelsteins castle

DR FINKELSTEIN

DR FINKELSTEIN

Performed by Danny Elfman
Whats this Whats this
Theres color everywhere

Theres white things in the air
Whats this
I cant believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up Jack this isnt fair
Whats this
Whats this Whats this
Theres something very wrong
Whats this
Theres people singing songs
Whats this
The streets are lined with

Little creatures laughing

turkey tree
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this

Whats this

Theres children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads

Theyre busy building toys

And absolutely no ones dead

eres frost on every window

I cant believe my eyes

nd in my bones I feel the warmth
ats coming from inside

HpoH

Look

ats this

eyre hanging mistletoe they kiss

y that looks so unique inspired

eyre gathering around to hear a story
oasting chestnuts on a fire

ats this

SWDHSaHaO

ats this

n here theyve got a little tree how queer
nd who would ever think

nd why

PPH Ss

eyre covering it with tiny little things
eyve got electric lights on strings

nd theres a smile on everyone

O now correct me if Im wrong

is looks like fun

is looks like fun

could it be I got my wish

ats this

SQxXHuUrPHH

Oh my what now

The children are asleep

But look theres nothing underneath

No ghouls no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them only little cozy things

Secure inside their dreamland

Whats this

The monsters are all missing

And the nightmares cant be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights the sounds
Theyre everywhere and all around
Ive never felt so good before
I simply cannot get enough

I want it oh I want it

Oh I want it for my own

Ive got to know

Ive got to know

What is this place that I have found
What is this
Christmas Town

Clown
giggles as he hits Sally

JACK
Listen everyone I want to tell you about Christmastown

Town Meeting Song
Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

JACK

There are objects so peculiar

They were not to be believed

All around things to tantalize my brain
Its a world unlike anything Ive ever seen
And as hard as I try

I cant seem to describe

Like a most improbable dream

But you must believe when I tell you this
Its as real as my skull and it does exist
Here let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

DEVIL
A box
is it steel

WEREWOLF
Are there locks

HARLEOUIN DEMON
Is it filled with a pox

DEVIL WEREWOLF HARLEQUIN DEMON
A pox
How delightful a pox

JACK

If you please

Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole things topped with a bow

WITCHES

A bow

But why

How ugly
Whats in it
Whats in it

JACK
Thats the point of the thing not to know

CLOWN
Its a bat
Will it bend

CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
Its a rat
Will it break

UNDERSEA GAL
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake

JACK
Listen now you dont understand
Thats not the point of Christmas land

Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock

And hang it like this on the wall

MR HYDE
Oh yes Does it still have a foot

MEDIUM MR HYDE
Let me see let me look

SMALL MR HYDE
Is it rotted and covered with gook

JACK
Um let me explain
Theres no foot inside but theres candy
Or sometimes its filled with small toys

MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
Small toys

WINGED DEMON
Do they bite

MUMMY
Do they snap

WINGED DEMON
Or explode in a sack

CORPSE KID
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

MAYOR

What a splendid idea

This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it

Lets try it at once

JACK

Everyone please now not so fast

Theres something here that you dont quite grasp

Well I may as well give them what they want

And the best I must confess I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land

Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice

Least thats what Ive come to understand

And Ive also heard it told

That hes something to behold

Like a lobster huge and red

When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is so Ive heard it said

And on a dark cold night
Under full moonlight

He flies into a fog

Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well at least theyre excited

But they dont understand

That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh well

Jacks house

JACK
Theres got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing
Dr Finkelsteins castle

DR FINKELSTEIN
Youve poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl

locks Sally away

DR FINKELSTEIN
Oh my headthe door is open

JACK
Hel-lo

SALLY

JACK

JACK

Sallys room

after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket

DR FINKELSTEIN
You can come out now if you promise to behave Sally
again

Sally

Oooh

Jacks house

Sally gives Jack his basket and sneaks off and picks a flower which
catches on fire

Jacks Obsession
Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN

Somethings up with Jack

Somethings up with Jack

Dont know if were ever going to get him back

Hes all alone up there
Locked away inside

Never says a word

Hope he hasnt died
Somethings up with Jack
Somethings up with Jack

JACK

ristmas time is buzzing in my skull

ill it let me be I cannot tell

eres so many things I cannot grasp

en I think Ive got it and then at last
rough my bony fingers it does slip

ike a snowflake in a fiery grip

PHeaH2zQ

Something here Im not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting

Like a memory long since past

Here in an instant gone in a flash
What does it mean

What does it mean

In these little bric-a-brac

A secrets waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all I love it though

Simple objects nothing more

But somethings hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Somethings there I cannot see

What does it mean

What does it mean

What does it mean

Hmm

Ive read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes

I know the Christmas carols all by heart

My skulls so full its tearing me apart

As often as Ive read them somethings wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on
Or perhaps its really not as deep

As Ive been led to think

Am I trying much too hard

Of course Ive been too close to see
The answers right in front of me
Right in front of me

Its simple really very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible but everywhere

Just because I cannot see it
Doesnt mean I cant believe it

You know I think this Christmas thing
Its not as tricky as it seems

And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone in fact but me

Why I could make a Christmas tree
And theres no reason I can find

I couldnt handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And thats exactly what Ill do
Hee hee hee

JACK
Eureka This year Christmas will be ours

MAYOR

Patience everyone Jack has a special Job for each of us Dr
Finkelstein your Xmas assignment is ready Dr Finkelstein to the front

Sallys Song
Performed by Catherine OHara

I sense theres something in the wind
That feels like tragedys at hand
And though Id like to stand by him
Cant shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend

And does he notice my feelings for him
And will he see how much he means to me
I think its not to be

What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then
Although Id like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud

Try as I may it doesnt last

And will we ever end up together

No I think not its never to become
For I am not the one
