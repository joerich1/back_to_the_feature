FADE IN ON

INT TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT

START ON THE FACE of A GOLDEN CAT STATUE This is the cat-
god BAST lithe noble beautiful CAMERA MOVES to reveal
the statue is 50 feet tall dominating this space Other

images of CATS -- hieroglyphics ceramics -- abound as do --
REAL CATS hundreds of them slinking in the shadows on ramps
cut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple

At Basts feet EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi-
circle around a flaming BRAZIER Some of the women WEEP
others PRAY or stare stoically ahead From outside we now
hear DISTANT SCREAMS the sounds of MARAUDERS Theres a
RHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS

EXT TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT

THE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered
columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a
hilltop VILLAGE in FLAMES under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY

SUPERIMPOSE 496 BC

WHAM THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into
the ornate DOORS of the temple PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the
brutal siege engine SLAM the doors again and again

INT TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT

The HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that
mostly conceals her face She moves from one ACOLYTE to the
next pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into
golden goblets then pours one for herself She raises her

goblet toward BAST as do the others -- they drink in unison

HIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN
SLUMP to the ground dead PULL BACK -- were watching

this from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim
elegant dark-spotted gray and black fur a SCARAB MARK on

its head

THE MAU lets out a CRY which prompts an eerie growing
CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS

THE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse leaping from
niches converging on the bodies The MAU leads the way

moves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers

ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open
THE SOLDIERS bearing TORCHES and SWORDS storm inside They
grab anything of value SMASH and DEFACE everything else

At the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES but theres no sign of
the women who wore them SOLDIERS slash the robes with their
swords anyway then snatch up the goblets for booty

An unearthly CRY -- half-human half-feline -- from somewhere
high above the rampaging soldiers They freeze looking

around frantically More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls

from all directions The SOLDIERS raise their weapons

clustering defensively From out of the shadows above them
DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility
STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST peering down impassively The
torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the

statues golden surface FLAILING SWORDS the swift
SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of
the soldiers clearly outmatched in this mortal combat

MOVE TO THE CATS perched above the fray looking downward as
they pace the temples ledges and ramps excitedly THE MAU
takes a final look at its handiwork then leaps up slinks

through a crevice at the roof and emerges on --

CUT TO

A ROOFTOP

We hear the modern SOUNDS of passing AUTO TRAFFIC CAMERA
ROTATES to reveal --

EXT EDNAS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

THE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH looking down ona
present-day suburban street a busy main drag MARSHLAND and
WATER are visible not far away light RAIN FALLS

SUPERIMPOSE 2500 YEARS LATER

The MAU watches as ACROSS THE STREET a BUS pulls away from
the curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO
-- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast

The HOOD is thrown back revealing PATIENCE PRICE 25-35
attractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her
face baggy clothes under her poncho Shes cautious eager
to please to do whats expected of her

-- a bit of a doormat

Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of
paper and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as

if shed sensed its presence She smiles

THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat then slinks out of sight

EXT EDNAS HOME - DAY

An eccentric ramshackle home amongst neat well-kept houses
PATIENCE moves to the front door RINGS As she waits she
notes the lawn GRASS grown high CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on
the shingles A SIGN by the door FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY
EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain Shes 50-70 a former
academic intelligent charming but quite intimidating

EDNA

PATIENCE

EDNA

Oh yes do come inside
EDNA undoes the chain opens the door for her

INT EDNAS HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
PATIENCE out of her poncho fills out a questionnaire on a
clipboard Numerous CATS roam the premises Feline artwork

and curios scratching posts furry toys cat paradise

PATIENCE

Maam
EDNA is putting out DRY CAT FOOD in numerous BOWLS

EDNA
You may call me Edna
PATIENCE

Edna Some of these questions are kind of
personal Do you really need to know how many um
partners Ive had in the past year

EDNA

Im not interested in your love life But do
want to know what sort of home environment youre
offering your degree of commitment

PATIENCE

Guess wouldnt need the cat if

Patience forces a laugh fills in a ZERO and passes the
clipboard to EDNA The woman puts down the cat food slips
on the reading glasses she wears ona chain around her neck

EDNA

The application is mostly a formality have a
sense about people

PATIENCE

Well Ive always liked animals

(not enough)

Cats specifically mean love them worship

them even

EDNA seems satisfied returns to reading Patiences answers
THE MAU meanwhile comes around a corner into the room
peering curiously at Patience -- who dangles her hand
invitingly He rubs his face against her hand

PATIENCE smiles coos at the cat -- which grabs her hand hard
in his CLAWS PATIENCE stifles a yelp yanks her hand back

PATIENCE

Son of a --

EDNA

Excuse me

PATIENCE

Nothing handsome cat Ive never seen one like
him

THE MAU jumps into Patiences lap settling in Edna
surprised and almost suspicious eyes the cat

EDNA

Her Thats Midnight an Egyptian Mau Normally
she doesnt trust people --

EDNA reaches a hand toward MIDNIGHT -- the cats fur stands
up she HISSES and SWIPES at Edna

EDNA

See Even cant get near her Very strange

(glancing at the
application)
So You left out your parents’ address
PATIENCE

Well theyre both dead

EDNA

No hereditary illnesses hope

PATIENCE

Private plane crash was eleven Actually the

last thing they gave me was a kitten Fatso
EDNA sucks her breath in at this insulting name

PATIENCE

He was very round -- not from overfeeding or
anything just -- really he didnt mind Anyway
he was with me a long time till early this year
He didnt come at the sound of the can-opener
which kind of freaked me out found him just
curled up there in his little bed

PATIENCE is getting a bit emotional EDNA reaches across and
squeezes her hand with genuine sympathy MIDNIGHT snuggles
into Patiences lap PURRING as she strokes the cat

EDNA

Its very hard dear know you must be in so

much pain

Midnight digs her long NAILS into Patiences thigh kneading
PATIENCE winces tries to dislodge cats claws from her leg
-- Midnight playfully attacks her hand Stifling a gasp
PATIENCE

Mm-hmm

EDNA

Funny how cats get under our skin They do exactly

as they please they dont care what anyone thinks

about them theyre the ultimate predators So
self-contained so independent so wild

sometimes wonder why do they even put up with

us

PATIENCE

The free food

EDNA

(putting the papers

aside)

Well congratulations It seems youve been
chosen

PATIENCE

So you think you might have a kitten for me

EDNA

Kitten No that wouldnt be appropriate
Midnight has chosen you
PATIENCE looks a little unnerved at this MIDNIGHT rolling
on her back seems to be baring her fangs at Patience

EDNA
Its a great honor Maus are a very rare breed
descended from the sacred cats of ancient Egypt

They were believed to have magical gifts

MIDNIGHT has wrapped herself around Patiences arm kicking
and biting playfully

PATIENCE
Im not sure she likes me --
EDNA

Nonsense she perceives something very special in
you

PATIENCE
Theres nothing special about me
EDNA

Cats see things we dont Our secret selves -- our
souls
PATIENCE
Mm Do you have any Band-Aids

YOUNG PATIENCE theres a picture of a LITTLE GIRL between

TWO SMILING PARENTS on a ROLLER COASTER Mostly though

with a seductive pout She purses her lips in a kiss

REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE watches with a curled lip on the
couch in a T-shirt and shorts EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM
directly from a pint carton a dark smear around her mouth
Suddenly MIDNIGHT POUNCES at the SPOON OF ICE CREAM
Patience jerks back startled raises the spoon out of reach

PATIENCE

No -- this is mine

MIDNIGHT doesnt back off jumping repeatedly at the spoon
climbing over Patience getting a rear PAW in the open pint

PATIENCE

Oh gross you -- just take it
Patience offers the cat the half-empty pint As MIDNIGHT
digs in happily burying his head in the container --

LIGHTS COME ON in the apartment across the way

PATIENCE hesitates only an instant sticks the spoon in her

mouth CLICKS OFF the TV and flips off a LAMP by the sofa

THROUGH THE WINDOW A HANDSOME MAN -- his name is TOM LONE --
crosses past

PATIENCE sighs in the dark moving for a better view This

voyeurism is a guilty habit

LONE checks his mail loosens his tie unbuttons his shirt
PATIENCE

Welcome home sweetie How was work today

(male voice)

Same old same old All wanna do is get out of

this shirt and give you a big old hug

LONE is distracted reading his mail shirt still on

MIDNIGHT meanwhile pulls her head out of the ice cream and
leaps onto the windowsill -- she looks first at Lone then at
Patience who looks around her

PATIENCE

Down in front Come on you off with the shirt
Instead LONE is moving out of view PATIENCE moves in the
same direction into her BATHROOM

INT PATIENCES APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

unbutton his shirt glances casually out the window --

PATIENCE immediately ducks out of sight A moment later she
rises slowly to peek out again --

THE WINDOW is DARK LONE has turned off THE LIGHT

PATIENCE flips ON THE LIGHT studies her face in the mirror

PATIENCE

Lame lame lame

She wipes a bit of chocolate from the corner of her mouth
She tries a seductive pout a la Laurel gives her hair a
seductive toss -- it winds up in her eyes and mouth

ON PATIENCES WINDOW -- from across the alley we see

PATIENCE seems bored by the drone work -- then she cocks her
head at something on the screen leans closer She double-
checks DATA in the print-outs Something doesnt tally

ON SCREEN -- among a long list of figures we see YP-3
highlighted followed by a series of numbers

PATIENCE gets up quickly with the printouts she spills a few
drops of COFFEE on her white blouse She dabs at these
distractedly as she moves through the bullpen toward a
glassed-in office She knocks on the open door where we see
the name D BERGER - ACCOUNTING

well-meaning but a bit dim and victimized

LAUREL

She throws her arms around Georges to give him a kiss but he

pushes her away turns aside to SNEEZE

LAUREL
Are you all right
GEORGES

a surplus --

BERGER

BERGER

And very expensive Funding seems to have been
siphoned out of the employee pension plan --

GEORGES

Impossible this has to be an error Are you
responsible for this data

BERGER

Well actually Patience Price brought the matter to
my

attention --

A YOUNG COUPLE making out an ELDERLY COUPLE holding hands
Her eyes drift to an AD for AVENAL BEAUTY overhead -- LAUREL
and GEORGES AVENAL arms around each other Patience sighs

and stares out the window

EXT PATIENCES BUILDING - NIGHT

PATIENCE walks toward her building the bus kiosk behind her
the BUS MOVING AWAY The street is deserted at this hour
Patience feels very alone until she looks up to see --

-- MIDNIGHT perched in her window awaiting her arrival

A smile appears on Patiences face She quickens her step
crossing the empty street almost to the sidewalk when --

-- AN ENGINE ROARS behind her Patience spins just as --

-- THE MERCEDES LIGHTS OFF barrels out of the darkness and

WHAM Hits her full-on

MIDNIGHT at the WINDOW -- the cat lets out a HOWL

from nearby approaching LIGHTS of the CITY further away

CAMERA FINDS a nylon-encased FOOT PAN OVER a womans
CORPSE her clothes TORN SOAKED and MUDDY strewn with RIVER
WEEDS The body bobs amidst REEDS by this soggy shoreline

We reach the womans FACE -- unnaturally pale eyes fixed

its PATIENCE PRICE Dead

THE HOWLING is CLOSE now THE CATS have gathered here
parting for MIDNIGHT a feline VIP The Mau steps

tentatively out onto Patiences corpse careful not to get

too wet She crouches on her chest and --

CLOSE BREATHES audibly into her parted lips A brief

barely visible GLOW flickers at Patiences mouth

THE CAT shudders then moves aside BLINKS as if drugged

EXT MARSHLAND - NIGHT (PRESENT)

-- PATIENCE sits up INTO FRAME with a SCREAM

She thrashes in the shallows of the marsh gasping for air
disoriented reborn Theres no sign of the cats

PATIENCE crawls onto shore amidst the reeds slightly clumsy
at first almost like a newborn kitten Her ragged wet

clothes cling to her body

TIGHT on her terrified expression She has no idea what

shes doing here -- or who or what she is She opens her
mouth to speak -- all that comes out is a strangled CAT CRY
She works her jaw but cant produce human speech She darts
her head seems disoriented and overwhelmed

HER POV -- SOUNDS AMPLIFIED IMAGE perhaps SOLARIZED the
darkness BRIGHTENED objects of interest HIGHLIGHTED as she
takes in the marshland The EYES of any creature in sight
GLOW Well call this CATVISION

WHIP PAN TO a nearby CRICKET perched on a blade of grass --
then UP TO an OWL in the distance soaring over the park

WHIP DOWN TO its prey a SCURRYING MOUSE THE OWL swoops
with a SCREECH nailing the MOUSE we hear its SQUEAL
PATIENCE frightened at first becomes increasingly delighted

by her heightened senses She spots --

MIDNIGHT in the tall grass The cat turns looks over her

shoulder once -- her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW Patience
is clearly meant to follow

PATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours tenuously at first
But as she proceeds her shoulders and hips roll in

distinctly feline fashion Her body seems slimmer more
muscular She rises on two legs moving in a slinky crouch
MIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on the bark of a gnarled
old TREE PATIENCE follows Midnights lead leans forward
against the trunk arms straight out head arched back She
stretches her neck her back -- her every movement is
graceful sensual the awkwardness gone

She tries to pull her hands from the tree -- but cant for a
moment finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark (like a
cat at a scratching post)

A DOG BARKS -- without thinking about it PATIENCE scrambles
up the side of the tree like a streak

HER POV FROM TREE -- A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNERS leash
some distance away The dog walker yanks the dog onward
PATIENCE takes this in hears a MEOW --

MIDNIGHT is perched above her very Cheshire Cat-like
PATIENCE looks around self-conscious for a moment -- what is
she doing up a tree Bad idea to think She loses her

balance clutching at branches tumbles out of the tree --

IN MIDAIR for an instant she flails spastically letting out

a SHRIEK -- then her body instinctively TWISTS and --

PATIENCE LANDS on all fours one leg kicked out haunches
low MIDNIGHT lands beside her nods approvingly at her
landing Then the cat darts away again Patience pursues

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

MIDNIGHT leaps to the top of a FENCE staring down at
Patience -- come on Patience hesitates then crouches and
SPRINGS UP (with more than human ability) lands triumphantly
on the fence -- then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side
MIDNIGHT looks disappointed Patience jumps up again
quickly as if pretending this never happened this time
managing to hold her balance

MIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward At first shes
like a tightrope walker careful of falling but her steps
become more confident Soon shes moving as quickly and
smoothly as the cat

MIDNIGHT leaps off the fence and darts across a road
PATIENCE follows

EXT PUBLIC GARDENZOO - NIGHT

A tall wrought-iron FENCE surrounds greenery and distant
cages in an urban area A SIGN ARBORETUM - ZOO
MIDNIGHT squeezes through a gap between the uprights
PATIENCE hesitates -- this is too narrow for a normal human
MIDNIGHT waits impatiently on the other side tail twitching
PATIENCE makes a dubious SOUND but manages to slip a foot --
then a leg -- into the opening twisting and contorting
Amazingly shes succeeding her torso ripples and contracts

as she insinuates herself between the bars Finally only her
head is on the wrong side With a final TUG shes through
MIDNIGHT crouches low stalking PATIENCE copies the
behavior MIDNIGHT slowly approaches --

A MOTH fluttering near a FLOWER in this botanical garden
MIDNIGHT sneaks up close then POUNCES but the MOTH flies
out of the cats grasp

PATIENCE GIGGLES MIDNIGHT turns on her and HISSES The
woman and the cat roll together in this neat BOTANICAL
GARDEN playing and batting at each other CAMERA MOVES TO a
small sign nearby which labels this planting as CATNIP
MIDNIGHT HURTLES a CONCRETE MOAT PATIENCE follows still
high giggly She suddenly finds herself face to face with

A BENGAL TIGER He lets out a small ROAR

PATIENCE blinks crouches -- and ROARS back unafraid The
tiger springs forward and LICKS HER She wrestles with
him playfully hes just a bigger version of Midnight

breaks DISPLAY CASES with a wrapped hammer snatches up the
contents -- necklaces rings etc -- stuffing them into a

BAG

As he moves a SHADOWY FIGURE -- CATWOMAN -- moves with him
looking over his shoulder close enough to touch but unseen

Each time he turns his head she has just slinked out of his

view -- her timing is impeccable

THIEF 2 with a SHOTGUN stands guard over a blindfolded
bound-and-gagged NIGHT WATCHMAN CATWOMAN appears on the
periphery of his vision but when he turns his head shes
disappeared behind a case -- she emerges on the other side

just before he turns back

THIEF 3 is at work on a LOCKED STEEL CASE of DRAWERS
with a BLOWTORCH and TOOLS CATWOMAN STEPS LIGHTLY across
the CASE above him he looks up -- but theres nobody there

He returns to his work gets the CASE open and pulls out a
DRAWER revealing a RACK full of glittering DIAMONDS

CATWOMAN (0S)

Oooh pretty
THE THREE THIEVES spin looking around --

THIEF 1
Up there

THIEF 2 aims his SHOTGUN at --

CATWOMAN perched on a narrow LEDGE at the ceiling moulding
She VAULTS down just as he FIRES a SPRAY OF PLASTER

THIEF 2 pumps his shotgun looking around frantically

THIEF 2

What the hell was that

CATWOMAN springs out from behind a DISPLAY CASE gives Thief
2 a roundhouse KICK in the head that sends the man into a

wall knocking him cold

THIEF 1 pulls a HANDGUN but the END OF THE WHIP wraps
around it ina flash yanks it from his hand
CATWOMAN SNAPS HER WHIP at Thief 1 and Thief 3 backing
them into a corner As she passes the tied-up GUARD she
uses her claws to SLASH his ropes In time with WHIP CRACKS

CATWOMAN

You boys -- thought you could just barge -- in here

and take -- all these beautiful things -- that

dont belong to you

The guard quickly tears off his GAG and BLINDFOLD untying

his own feet then picks up the fallen handgun and trains it

on the thieves We hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING
CATWOMAN meanwhile swiftly gathers up fallen jewels sweeping
them into the swag bag She pauses for a moment thoughtful

CATWOMAN

(to herself)
What a lovely idea

With lightning speed she vanishes out the back with the bag
THE GUARD totally focused on the thieves doesnt even
register shes gone THIEF 3 points --

up and realizes -- she was sleeping against the belly of the
BENGAL TIGER lying on his side in his sunken ENCLOSURE
CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet terrified yanks OFF
HER MASK With the daylight shes back to being plain old
PATIENCE She looks down in shock at her revealing outfit

Shes awakened the TIGER Patience lets out another
frightened CRY as he eyes her no longer recognizing her as a
friend The tiger GROWLS gets to his feet menacingly

starts moving in for the kill

PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR which she
frantically wrestles to open getting through and SLAMMING IT

pins hold the outfit together but it looks good on her
EDNA is pulling out teacups a TEAKETTLE on the burner

EDNA

You were afraid -- you became its prey The tiger
shredded your clothes

PATIENCE
No did that myself mean remember doing
it but it wasnt really -- you know -- me God
dont understand whats happening

EDNA

Im not sure how to put this -- it may be hard for
you to accept -- but Im something of an expert in

these matters --

PATIENCE

What matters

EDNA

Vampirism lycanthropy feligyny
PATIENCE

(lost)
Um

EDNA

Feles Latin for cat Gynos Greek for female

Im a professor of folklore and mythology -- that
is used to be until was denied tenure They
said my work was frivolous but it was an all-male
department and -- well its a long sordid story

PATIENCE

EDNA

Oh yes The other night think you may
have had an accident A very serious accident
Fatal

(as if to a child)
But -- Im not dead

Excuse me Cicero
ON PAPERS -- a DRAWING of the TEMPLE OF BAST

EDNA

The temple of the Catgod Bast A Persian army
destroyed it in the fifth century BC
EDNAs tone is sad as if this memory were fresh and painful

EDNA

Legend has it that the priestesses became the first
catwomen The cats theyd worshipped -- Midnights
ancestors -- each gave up one of its nine lives to

bring them back from the dead

ON A BOOK images of MEDIEVAL WITCHES with their cats

EDNA
In the middle ages cats and catwomen were regarded

as evil Nonsense of course witches were just

single independent women who broke societys

rules

EDNA passes Patience --

A BLACK AND WHITE print-out of a blurry SURVEILLANCE SHOT of
SELENA KYLE as seen in Batman Returns

EDNA

There were reports of a catwoman a while back on
the East Coast -- like many she turned to a life

of crime -- but apparently shes disappeared or

died

PATIENCE studies the photo

PATIENCE

How many have there been

EDNA

No one can be sure Ive found references
scattered through history but catwomen tend to
lead solitary secretive lives Hard to blame
them it seems most were murder victims

PATIENCE has heard enough She rises freaked out

PATIENCE
was murdered Why would anybody kill me No
never did anything to dont want to break the
rules

She moves out of the room Edna follows

INT EDNAS HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

PATIENCE

Shes like some demon possessing me in the night
but -- but can keep it under control during the
day --

EDNA

Well cats do sleep most of the day --

PATIENCE

When she takes over -- its like she just does

whatever she feels like she doesnt care what
people think --

EDNA

Is that so bad

PATIENCE

You dont understand -- Im afraid shes going to
hurt someone -- or get me killed Again

PATIENCE is near tears EDNA puts her arms around her

PATIENCE

Theres got to be a way to make it stop Some kind
of dont know garlic or wolfsbane or
something

EDNA

(thinking)

A domestic cat can return to its natural state
effortlessly But once a cats gone feral it can
never be tamed

PATIENCE

Okay that isnt helping
EDNA pulls back looks Patience in the eye

EDNA

Relax a little learn to live with your inner cat
Even love her -- she has many admirable qualities
-- integrate her into your life If you accept the
darker impulses try to channel them -- maybe
shell come to be domesticated --

PATIENCE

No Im going to fight her Im stronger than she
is --
EDNA
But youre only fighting yourself --
PATIENCE

-- and Im going to win

She quickly grabs some clothing darts toward the bathroom
At the last moment she spots the CAT MASK on the floor and --
-- KICKS it UNDER THE COUCH as she moves into the bathroom
LONE steps inside can see his apartment across the way He
calls through the half-open door as she changes

LONE

LONE seems a little taken aback at her vehemence Just then

a JAPANESE WAITER places a HUGE TRAY OF SUSHI between them
PATIENCE

Guess went a little crazy ordering

LONE

Its refreshing A lot of women wont let a man
see them eat

PATIENCE
Right then we go home and binge on Haagan-Dazs

During the following Lone meticulously mixes soy sauce and
wasabi uses chopsticks etc Patience simply peels the fish
off the rice and pops it in her mouth as if eating potato
chips then licking her fingers like a cat licking its paw

LONE
You do hide things dont you You may seem all
sweet and shy but youve got a secret wild side

PATIENCE

(watching her

reaction)

belt

LONE

LONE studies her for a few seconds He seems on the verge of
saying something important But instead

LONE
You want that toro

LONE is already reaching for another piece of sushi -- with
lightning reflexes PATIENCE grabs his hand to stop him -- he
looks up at her surprised She backs off with a smile

LONE
Individuals who feel compelled to act out through

an animal alter-ego -- bats birds bugs there

have been a number of cases in other cities -- they

catch themselves Take too many risks think they

can play with the cops See they like to be

watched

Hes staring right at her now Patience looks away

PATIENCE spins on him a glint in her eye

PATIENCE

So stop talking

So saying she throws her arm around his neck the other
around his back pulls him close for a KISS Lone takes only
a moment to respond -- its a good one -- until --

CLOSE ON LONES BACK as her CLAWS involuntarily emerge
tearing right through his shirt and an inch down his

back --

LONE jerks away looking back over his shoulder --
LONE

PATIENCE clutches her hands to her face horrified at what
shes done starts backing away --

on the opposite side of the hall DRINA is rising heading

out the door

CATWOMAN climbs up the CURTAINS around the box levering
herself upward to the elaborate FRIEZE that wraps around the
top of the hall -- GREEK GODS in various dramatic poses

WIDER FROM BELOW as CATWOMAN climbs and creeps near the
ceiling moving over the PROSCENIUM ARCH above the stage
heading toward GEORGES

A POLICEMAN at ground level spots her -- he lifts a radio to

his lips calling for backup

The BALLET below is reaching a crescendo COPS are filing in
from the back of the theatre trying to be discreet

WITH GEORGES still absorbed in the ballet Suddenly
CATWOMAN lands in the empty seat beside him staring at the
stage herself A whisper

CATWOMAN

love this part

GEORGES spins startled -- and she SLASHES HIM across his
cheek The MUSIC is so loud no one hears his CRY OF PAIN
GEORGES rushes for the exit -- but CATWOMAN gets there first
shoves a CHAIR under the doors

CATWOMAN

Lets not be interrupted

She advances on him BLOOD drips from the SLASHES on his
cheek staining his tuxedo shirt

CATWOMAN

Reds a good color on you

At that she grabs Georges and slams him against the wall of
the box behind a curtain partly concealed from view The
DOOR RATTLES increasingly hard

CLOSE as CATWOMAN wraps a hand around Georges throat the
CLAW TIPS digging into his skin He gasps

GEORGES

No -- please --

CATWOMAN

could rip out your throat

GEORGES

Why -- why kill me

CATWOMAN

Because you deserve it And because can

delivering the deathblow

up with tears his expression pleading desperate Suddenly

CATWOMAN releases him throws him GASPING to the floor

FLATS from a GRAVEYARD SCENE bowling over costumed DANCERS

ROPES as the BAGS drop scrambling higher onto the GRID --

grid He trains a gun on her -- CATWOMAN freezes She

stares at him breathing hard taking a moment to come to
grips with this adversary LONE advances on her stepping

gingerly
LONE

Youre under arrest --
He steps on a flimsy support which starts to give way
Catwoman is alarmed

CATWOMAN

Watch out

LONE sways losing his balance she springs and grabs his gun
arm saving him A beat as they look at each other then --

-- she SNATCHES the gun out of his hand tosses it aside
then grabs his tie and pulls his face to her to LICK his

cheek

CATWOMAN

Tag youre it

She bounds away comfortable on the narrow railings Lone

pursues moving more carefully now Accompanied by the

ballet music the two perform their private dance high above

the TOMBSTONES and GRAVES

CATWOMAN winds up in a corner on a MESH PLATFORM no way out
from here but for a 25-foot drop to --

THE FLOOR where POLICE await pointing upward

LONE advances he has her trapped He pulls HANDCUFFS

CATWOMAN

Handcuffs Yummy
He lunges at her -- she dodges kicks a leg out from under
him No slouch at fighting Lone recovers plants a kick in
her mid-section She gasps surprised

CATWOMAN
You play rough
LONE

This isnt a game

He charges at her but she parries a blow lands a SLASH
across his shoulder As he comes at her again she jumps and
grabs an overhead ELECTRICAL cable swinging away --

Lone has too much momentum he loses balance about to go
over the edge -- CATWOMAN swings back like a pendulum
wrapping her legs around his neck saving him from falling
She swings him back over the platform tries to kick him off
but he grabs her legs pulling her and SNAPPING THE CABLE --
STAGE LIGHTS go out ELECTRICAL SPARKS fly as they hit the
platform together she lands straddling him catching the
SPARKING CABLE just before it strikes the mesh

LONE
Be careful That thing hits the metal were both

fried
CATWOMAN leans close whispers
CATWOMAN

knew there was a spark between us

She turns and flings the cable away it dangles free of the

mesh floor still spitting SPARKS A second later CLICK --

LONE has slapped a handcuff on her wrist CLICKS the other
cuff over his own CATWOMAN spins back on him looking hurt
He reaches to pull off her mask She slaps his hand

CATWOMAN

Please its our first date wouldnt want the

mystery to go out of our relationship

LONE struggles to push her off but she keeps her thighs
locked around him He finally rolls on top of her

LONE

We dont have a relationship

CATWOMAN

(mock sadness)

You men love the chase but once you catch us you
always lose interest

As she speaks CLOSE on her cuffed hand -- her fingers
squeeze together her hand slithers out of the cuff like a

cats paw

LONE rises tries to pull Catwoman to her feet -- but he
comes up with an empty dangling HANDCUFF

From the ground CATWOMAN plants a kick in his back from
behind he falls forward and SLAMS his FACE HARD into a LIGHT
RIG Catwoman winces sounding a lot like Patience

CATWOMAN

Sorry
Shes on her feet ready to scamper off but --
MORE COPS have made it to the grid blocking every way down -

ANGLE DOWN COPS have covered every exit below
LONE glares up at her

LONE
Its over
CATWOMAN

And here thought we were hitting it off

With that she leaps and grabs the dangling POWER LINE which
TEARS LOOSE from the ceiling --

She DROPS to the floor still holding the CABLE COPS

surround her moving in quickly guns drawn --

She backs toward the wall near a CIRCUIT BREAKER PANEL

CATWOMAN

Show of hands -- who can see in the dark
She lifts her own hand daintily then violently SWINGS THE
POWER CABLE into the CIRCUIT BREAKERS --

A FLASH a BANG a SHOWER OF SPARKS -- then --

PITCH DARKNESS We hear SHOUTS from the theatre people
PANICKING and a series of GRUNTS and OOFS as Catwoman takes
out the nearest adversaries --

herself for something looking toward the Avenal building

A WINDOW WASHER RIG hangs halfway down the building but its
quite a distance from this roof edge

Shes addressing MIDNIGHT who non-commitally licks a paw
CATWOMAN moves to the far end of the roof and sprints toward
the edge leaps for all shes worth --

CATWOMAN sails through the air in a perfect arc toward the
window-washer rig but shes going to fall short and plunge
twenty stories At the last second she pulls out her whip

and snaps it out around --

turn PINK then RED BLOTCHES appear Abruptly the petals
BLACKEN WITHER and ULCERATE The flower is a shriveled mess

XAVIER carefully removes the nozzle nodding appreciatively
at the canisters

XAVIER

altogether -- chemical weapons are a growth

industry

THE MERCS with slightly nervous looks begin carefully
moving the canisters out of the penthouse up the stairs to

They dont lower their guns Catwoman narrows her eyes
speaks around the cigar

CATWOMAN

She jerks one of the cases -- the latch has been loosened it
POPS OPEN and CASH GOES FLYING into the wind --
DRIFTING from the rooftop to the city streets below
LAUREL reacts in agony

LAUREL

No please-- dont do that again
CATWOMAN drops the emptied case and pulls the cigar from her
mouth with a distasteful expression Eying Laurel

CATWOMAN
Dont you hate it when somebody shows up at a party
wearing the same dress

LAUREL advances on Catwoman

LAUREL
Lets face it -- were alike you and me
Catwoman ignores her shouts to XAVIER and his men

CATWOMAN

You guys gotta be careful with this YP-3 stuff

Its a living thing you know a bacteria If it

gets too hot -- it dies

XAVIER looks from Catwoman to the FUEL pooling on the
helipad putting two and two together He jerks his head at
his mercs -- they start backing away toward the stairs
LAUREL is still focused on the money

LAUREL

Lets split the rest of the money -- and theres
more where that came from --

CATWOMAN

Tempting offer We would make a pretty good team

Beyond the law fighting the yoke of male

oppression sisters under the skin

LAUREL nods hopefully CATWOMAN looks thoughtfully at the

cigar in her hand

CATWOMAN

Nah still have to live with myself

So saying she flicks the LIT CIGAR to the helipad --

IGNITING the spreading pool of gasoline --

PATIENCECATWOMAN

So you upped production and sold the stuff to an

LAUREL

Life hands you lemons you make lemonade

A FLAMING BEAM gives way blocking the STAIRWELL part of the

out from under PATIENCECATWOMAN But instead of going for
the gun she runs straight for the make-up mirror

PATIENCECATWOMAN runs to Lones side pulling him away from
the spreading flames toward the ELEVATOR She SLASHES the

tape that binds his wrists

revealing numerous LATEX MASKS She begins to apply a new
