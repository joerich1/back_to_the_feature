Screenplay by
George Lucas

Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck

RADIO

On a dark screen an immense amber light appears and an
electric humming begins The eerie light glows brighter

illuminates a single huge number--11 We hear static
large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across
screen

Pulling back slowly we watch the glowing band traverse
and forth over the amber light and past more numbers
70 90 110 130 And we begin to hear voices--
songs fading conversations and snatches of music

with static

Pulling back further we realize it is a car radio

the screen and radio stations were hearing until the
indicator stops Theres a pauseand suddenly we are

by a blasting-out-of-the-past Rocking and Rolling
the-volume pounding Intro to a Vintage 1962 Golden
Radio Show--back when things were simpler and the music
better

And now a wolf howl shatters through time as the
Wolfman Jack hits the airwaves his gravel voice

and growling while the music pumps and grinds

WOLFMAN

The Wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as Rock
Clock blasts forth

MELS DRIVE-IN--DUSK

A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast

as the sun drops behind a distant hill A large neon
buzzes in the foreground MELS DRIVE-IN while in
background Rock Around The Clock blares from the

a beautiful decked and channeled white with red trim
and-rolled 58 Chevy Impala that glides into the drive-
Main titles appear over action Steve Bolander stops
elegant machine and gets out He looks around then
the front of the car and leans against the flame-
hood Steve is eighteen good-looking ina
button-down short-sleeved shirt Most likely to
president of his graduating class He looks around the
drive-in then hears a funny little horn

A Vespa scooter bumps into the lot A young kid waves
and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter
topples Terry Fields (The Toad) maneuvers the

next to Steves Chevy but misjudges and ricochets off
trash can before stopping Terry grins sheepishly Hes
seventeen short but plenty loud both vocally and
sartorically in his pink and black shirt levis and
bucks He looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks

projecting an air of supercool
primp
He

Steve

moustache and

envelope

out

Steve watches Terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and
his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead
unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his
look tough

Terry walks over and leans against the flamed car
Steve who pays him no mind In the background we hear
Wolfman howling with the music The record ends and a
of humor begins from Wolfman Jack The Wolfman is an
companion to all the kids Witty and knowledgeable
trivia that counts hes their best friend confidant
guardian angel

Now a grey insect-like Citroen deux-chevaux putters
the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot
and Terry watch Curt Henderson get out

Curt stands by his little car Hes seventeen a curly
bespectacled scraggly kid with a summer-grown

a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts Curt thinks of
himself as the town cynic In reality hes a hopeless
romantic He starts over to his buddies

TERRY
Hey whadaya say Curt Last night
in town you guys gonna have a little
bash before you leave

STEVE
The Moose have been lookin for you
all day man
Steve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an
without saying anything Curt opens it slowly and pulls

a check

CURT
(sarcastic)
Oh great

TERRY
Whadaya got whadaya got Wow--two

thousand dollars Two thousand doll--

Steve looks at Curt suspiciously Curt seems somehow

guilty
STEVE
Mr Jenning couldnt find you so he
gave it to me to give to you He
said hes sorry its so late but

Lodge has given out Oh yeah he
says theyre all very proud of you
Curt hands the envelope back to Steve

Well ah why dont you hold

STEVE

CURT
Steve Ah I think wed better

Suddenly a horn honks and they all turn Laurie
Henderson

driving

the familys 58 Edsel

STEVE

Laurie honks the horn a couple of times Steve ignores

her
There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable

STEVE

STEVE

town and now you want to crawl back
into your cell--look I gotta talk

(he hands the check

back to Curt)
Now take it Were leaving in the
morning Okay

Suddenly theres an ear-splitting roar and they all
turn as

a yellow 32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped lowered and
sporting

a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot The low slung classic
rumbles

and parks at the rear of the drive in

Big John Milner twenty-two sits in his Ford tough
and

indifferent puffing on a Camel He wears a white T-
shirt

and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a
ducktail A

cowboy in a deuce coupe--simple sentimental and
cocksure of

himself

As the radio blares Sixteen Candles
darkness Burger City has come alive A continual line
rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked
then returns to the maindrag Carhops glide by on
skates Curt and John are fooling around in front of
deuce coupe A horn honks and they turn as a 60 Ford
three girls in it slows by them A girl leans out the

and smiles

GIRL
Hi John
The girls in the car all screech and giggle as they

JOHN
Not too good huh

CURT
Why is it every girl that comes around

Where is the dazzling beauty Ive
been searching for all my life

John watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling

JOHN
I know what you mean The pickins

strip is shrinking Ah you know I

you a couple of hours and a tank
full of gas just to make one circuit

It was really somethin

from an incredible high-performance engine The entire

Suddenly

JOHN

Across the swarming parking lot Steve sits in the

front
leans

where

Steve

with

the

too

her

with

seat of his chevy with Laurie Budda Macrae a car hop
down to attach a tray to Steves window showing off
tight blouse

BUDDA

A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate
mountain Anything else you want
Steve

(Steve shakes his

head)
If there is you let me know now
Just honk and Im yours

She tucks in her blouse a little tighter gives hima
look and goes to get the other tray Budda takes the
tray around the car almost shoves it in the window
Laurie is sitting

BUDDA
One fries--grab it before I drop it

She gives Laurie an antagonistic look and goes off
laughs Laurie smiles Shes seventeen very pretty
big doe-eyes and a short bobbed hairdo She pushes up
sleeves on Steves letterman sweater which is sizes
large for her His class ring glints on a chain around
neck Laurie is sweet the image of vulnerability but
a practical and self-preserving mind beneath

STEVE
Where was I

LAURIE
Um how you thought high school
romances were goofy and we started
going together just because you
thought I was kinda cute and funny
but then you suddenly realized you
were in love with me it was
serious and ah oh you were
leadin up to somethin kinda big
STEVE
You make it sound like Im giving
dictation Well seriously what I
meant was that ah since we do
care for each other so much and
since we should really consider
ourselves as adults Now I ah
could I have a couple of those fries

Through the windshield of the Chevy they see Terry run
by

in front of them chasing Budda Macrae whos
outdistancing

him on her roller skates

TERRY
Come on Budda Come on

Steve watches them go by then looks back at Laurie

STEVE
Ah where was I

LAURIE
consider ourselves adults

Laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries
but is
obviously expecting something big

STEVE
Right right anyway I thought
maybe before I leave we could ah
agree that that seeing other people
while Im away cant possibly hurt
you know

Laurie hasnt looked up but her mood has changed like a
mask

LAURIE
You mean dating other people

STEVE
I think it would strengthen our
relationship Then wed know for
sure that were really in love Not
that theres any doubt

Steve smiles and then looks to her He stops smiling
They
struggles
turns

and

and

intro
drive-in

she

listen to the radio for an awkward moment Laurie

to hold back her tears With obvious difficulty she
to him and smiles Hes expected something different
doesnt know what to do so he smiles back

LAURIE
I think youre right I mean were
not kids anymore and its silly to
think that when were three thousand
miles apart we shouldnt be able to
see other people and go out

Laurie takes his ring on the chain from around her neck
puts it in her purse

STEVE
Laurie now listen I didnt ask
for that back I think that

LAURIE
I know I just sort of think its
juvenile now Ill keep it at home
Its less conspicuous there

STEVE
You dont want to wear it

LAURIE
I didnt say that I understand and
Im not upset I mean I cant expect
you to be a monk or something while
youre away

Steve just looks at her and nods The Wolfman howls an
to Gee by the Crows Outside skooting around the
after Budda Terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as
delivers a tray to a car

TERRY
and I have a really sharp record
collection I even have Pledging My
Love by Johnny Ace Anyway how can
you love Nelson when hes going out
with Marilyn Gator Since he dumped
on you maybe we could--
BUDDA
He didnt dump on me you little
dip Hi Steve

Her tone changes immediately Terry looks sour and

turns
around to Steve whos getting out of the chevy Budda
leaves
wiggling her butt for Steve
TERRY
Shes a little conceited--just playing
hard to get
STEVE
Listen I came over here to talk to
you about--
TERRY
Any time buddy Im your man Nothing
I like better than chewing the rug
with a pal You talk Ill listen
Im all ears Shoot
STEVE
Shut up
TERRY
Sure
STEVE
Terry Im going to let you take
care of my car while were away--at
least until Christmas Im afraid if
I leave it with my--
Steve notices Terry isnt with him any more and turns
Terry
is standing frozen to a spot
STEVE
Whats wrong
Terry tries to talk much like a shell-shocked war
veteran
His mouth moves but only a gurgle comes out
Curt is standing by the Chevy talking with his sister
Laurie

Shes still upset by what Steve said to her
about

shell be
Steve
them
wipes

face

CURT
Hey sis--whats wrong

LAURIE
Nothing

Meanwhile they watch Terry as Steve explains to him
the car

STEVE
Now listen only 30 weight Castrol-
R Ive written the tire pressure
and stuff on a pad in the glove
compartment Are you listening

The others are watching now as Terry shakes his head
mechanically

CURT
Whats wrong hes crying

There is indeed a tear rolling down Terrys cheek

TERRY

I cant believe it

(He starts toward the

car and gently

caresses its paint)
I dont know what to say Ill
love and protect this car until death
do us part

(He circles the car)
This is a superfine machine This
may even be better than Daryl
Starbirds superfleck moonbird It
is better than Daryl Starbirds

Laurie watches Terry realizing that like the car

left behind as a fond memory She turns and looks at

whos been watching her Theres a moment between

Budda comes by with an empty tray Terry sees her and

his eyes He walks up to her a strange look on his
TERRY

Budda how would you like to go to
the drive-in movies with me
The idea is so preposterous that even Budda is

speechless
She looks around at others
BUDDA
Youve got to be kidding
TERRY
Would I kid you about a thing like
that I want you to know that
something has happened to me tonight
that is going to change everything
Ive got a new
John walks up quietly and casually pulls down hard on
the
back pockets of Terrys low riding levis There is
general

hysteria as Terry quickly pulls up his pants

TERRY
Car All right whos the wise--
(He turns and sees
John and changes his
tune)
Oh John--verrry funny
(He tries to laugh
with the others)

JOHN
Hey did she do that to you

STEVE

spent most of our lives in this
parking lot

TERRY

watch him go off

MAIN STREET MODESTO-NIGHT

During the day G street is a line of used car lots
shops tacky department stores and greasy spoons At
it is transformed into an endless parade of kids in
lowered and customed machines who rumble down the one
street through the seemingly adultless heat-drugged
town

Police cars glide ominously with the flow of traffic
parked cars couples neck between flashing headlights
looking cool in a 56 Chevy sit in the slouched

the true Low Rider--and over it all the music and the
can be heard Just now its Runaway by Del Shannon
John travels with the flow of traffic watching some
guys shooting squirt guns from a moving car John

deuce coupe effortlessly He looks over at a car pacing
alongside of his own

JOHN

A sweaty looking guy turns and nods from the window

him Terry accounts the slight to jealousy Then he
it and enjoys driving the beautiful Chevy again

pulls alongside of him as he cruises along slowly

GIRL
Hey kid

Terry looks over at the car cruising next to him In
back seat a guy has dropped his trousers and is
bare buttocks against the side window--a classic BA
with pressed ham Terry looks away wondering why this
still happening to him even in his new car
TRAVELING G STREET-LAURIES 58 EDSEL
Curt is in the back seat gazing out the window at the

They
are bored by his romantic visions
CURT
That means nothing to you people
You have no romance no soul She--

CRUISING G STREET-STEVES 58 CHEVY

Terry continues to cruise the main drag slouched low
looking cool in his newly acquired machine He adjusts
waterfall curl as the Wolfman dedicates a list of
passes a group of guys bullshitting around the raised
of a souped-up parked car

Terry cruises alongside two girls in a Ford He revs
engine to get their attention and once he has it he

to roll down their window They flip him the bird

and he lets them pass

floors the gas pedal and goes crashing backwards into a
Buick Terry is stunned for a moment then realizes he

A distinguished looking man comes up to his window

BOYS LAVATORY

We move down a row of sinks at which guys are working

as
intently on their coiffures as the girls Ducktails
being
smoothed glassy waterfalls being primped the fronts
of
crew cuts being waxed to stand stiff

of water down the pipes Suddenly theres a rumbling
noise

as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor
Panic

Everybody crashes for the doors laughing and shoving
each

HIGH SCHOOL GYM

The guys tumble out the lavatory door and abruptly cool
it

as a dumb-looking paunchy teacher stops and looks them
over

rocking on his heels They escape quietly Steve and
Eddie

Theyre watching the dancers as Hervie and his band
moan

through a slow number--Shes So Fine

Curt leans down to the window and is about to say
something

CRUISING MAIN STREET--32 DEUCE COUPE

CRUISING MAIN STREET--STEVES 58 CHEVY
Terry is looking and feeling like hes got it made He

downshifts and slows for a red light A very mean-
looking
next
girlfriend

Chevy

which
SuperChief

feeling

girlfriends’

him

black 55 Chevy--blown scooped and slicked--pulls up
to him The driver Bob Falfa has a gum-chewing
sitting almost on top of him Terry challenges the 55
by revving his engine

Bob Falfa doesnt even look over He revs his engine--
sounds like a cross between a Boeing 707 and a

Terry cant believe it He quits revving his engine--
deflated

Terry looks over at the snotty grin on Falfas

face

GIRLFRIEND
Aint he neat

Terry doesnt say anything and Bob Falfa glares over at

FALFA
Hey you know a guy around here with
a piss yellow deuce coupe--supposed
to be hot stuff

Falfa nods slowly

TERRY
Hey nobody can beat him man Hes

FALFA
Hey you see this Milner you tell
him Im lookin for him huh Tell

the road
GIRLFRIEND
(giving another snotty
smile)
Aint he neat

Terry doesnt say anything Theres another incredible
scream

as Falfa roars off leaving Terry to stare through his
smoke

Terry accelerates the 58 Chevy--at a prudent speed

As the radio blares Almost Grown Terry glides past
the

lighted stores slowly taking in everything with wide
eyes

from his beautiful new car

Terry passes a steaming rear-end collision at an
intersection

where two guys and two girls are all yelling

Then suddenly he spots a girl--walking--alone His
mouth

drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl Debbie

nineteen with blonde hair wearing a blue and white
spaghetti-

strap dress strolls along the sidewalk

Terry rolls the powerful engine but she ignores him
As he

passes her he speeds up

TERRY
What a babe what a bitchin babe
And Wolfman Baby shes all mine

Terry tears around the corner and starts his approach
once

more He quickly whips out his comb touches up his
hair and

settles down into a comfortable slouch

TERRY
Okay honey here I come--James Dean
lives

He hits the clutch roars the engine a couple more
times and

then--disaster Debbie passes behind some rough looking
dudes

on motorcycles parked along the curb One especially
vicious
biker turns and looks at Terry as he passes
Terry roars off around the block

TERRY
Stay cool honey--dont let those
creeps bug you Wolfman please dont
let those creeps bug her please

As Debbie passes the bikers they hoot holler and
make

barnyard noises From the cat calls and Debbies
manner it

seems obvious that Debbie is a girl a lot of boys have

known

She has walked clear of the bikers as Terry screeches
around

the corner again He pulls up alongside her and again
slows

to a crawl The pass each other for awhile but she
doesnt

look over

TERRY

Hi

(lowering his voice)
Hello buenos noches Need a lift
Nice night for a walk Do you know
John Milner Curt Henderson Sure

This stops her and she turns--Terry hits the brakes and
the
car bounces

TERRY
You do I mean it Just like Connie
Stevens I met her once

DEBBIE

slams

DEBBIE

Terry nods checks his clutch revs the engine to a
high-
pitched whine and theyre off--
The tires smoke scream the car shots off fish-
tailing
nearly hitting a parked car straightening out and
disappears down Main Street
HIGH SCHOOL GYM--THE HOP
On stage the band is taking five Theyre looking

making

announcements at the mike

blue

spotlight floats over the dance floor and then lands on
Steve

and Laurie who are in the midst of their argument

STEVE

Laurie squints into the spotlight and realizes
everybodys
watching them

LAURIE
Oh God come on

STEVE
Come on what

LAURIE
(pulling him toward
the floor)
Oh Steven--please everybodys
watching Smile or something

Steve gives a sick smile as she drags him out onto the

floor

A record needle scratches and Smoke Gets in Your Eyes
blares

out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of
the

floor The crowd quiets getting a little misty about
this

soon-to-be separated teenage couple For their part
Steve
and Laurie are arguing whispering in each others

ears
LAURIE
You think I care if you go off You
think Im going to crack up or
something Are you conceited
STEVE
Quit--quit pinching--I dont know
why I ever started taking you out in
the first place
He takes her hand from the tucked-under-the-chin
position

and puts it around him in a bear-hug

LAURIE
You take me out When we first met
you didnt have enough sense to take
the garbage out I asked you out
remember

STEVE
What do you mean you asked me out

LAURIE
Backwards Day--remember If I had
waited for you to ask me--even after
that you didnt call me for two weeks

STEVE
I was busy

LAURIE
You were scared Dave Oboler told
me Then when you did ask me out you
didnt kiss me for three dates

STEVE
Well--I was--

LAURIE
Scared--Jim Kaylor told me I even
asked my father why you hadnt kissed
me

STEVE
Your father--great

LAURIE
He said he thought you were bright
hating

her

alone

Gets

looking

He moans

and youd probably think of kissing
me after a while

LAURIE
You didnt of course I had to
Remember that picnic

STEVE
Out at the canyon

LAURIE
Oh boy You cant remember anything--
the first one up at the lake That
was the first time you kissed me--I
practically had to throw myself at
you

STEVE
(quietly)
I remember

They continue to dance slowly Laurie starts to cry

herself for it Steve loosens a minute and looks at

STEVE
Whats wrong

LAURIE
Go to hell

He holds her tighter and they circle the floor all

the crowd watching quietly the gym echoing with Smoke

in Your Eyes

THE GYM PARKING LOT

up at the stars and listening to the music floating out

the gym

WENDY

pokes Steve in the side
MR KROOT

He gives them a disgusted look and starts off

THE CANAL BANK

Steves Chevy sits near the canal The door is open and
radio blares while Terry and Debbie are off somewhere
the weeds making out

Suddenly a beam from a flashlight plays across the
Feet approach the car as the light beam moves across

interior and stops on the vacated shoes on the front

The light beam continues past the empty bourbon bottle
starts int he direction of the field where Terry and
are lost in the throes of passionate love As we follow
light into the field we hear footsteps

As the darkened figure approaches the couple we see
light go out and catch a gleam of silver in the

a switchblade springs open

Terry reacts to the sound

DEBBIE
Whats wrong

TERRY
I thought I heard something

She kisses him and he forgets about the noise The
retreats back to the Chevy where another indistinct

waits
VOICE (0S)
Theyre porking in the weeds No
sweat

Terry and Debbie are resting in the field listening to

the
radio in the distance A car engine is heard starting
up and
disappearing down the canal bank
The countryside is very quiet Only crickets and frogs
are
heard as Terry begins to drop off asleep He suddenly
jumps
with a start
TERRY
Wait a minute
DEBBIE
What
TERRY
The radio is gone That means--the
car is gone
He scrambles to the spot where the Chevy once stood
TERRY
Oh no OH NO
Debbie comes up and watches Terry look heavenward
TERRY
Oh God--Im sorry But why the car
You could have struck us with
lightning or something--anything---
but not the car
THE CANAL BANK--LAURIES 58 EDSEL
Cars are seen here and there in the moonlight along the
irrigation canal outside of town In the cars radios
are
playing To the Aisle laughter can be heard in some
whispering in others
Lauries Edsel is parked by the slow-moving water In
the

front seat of the car Steve and Laurie are making out
Laurie
look

around

leans back against Steve his arms around her

out the window at the stars

LAURIE
You know it doesnt make sense to
leave home to look for a home to
give up a life to find a new life
to say goodbye to friends you love
just to find new friends

STEVE
What Say that again I didnt--

LAURIE
Thats what Curt said

STEVE
Oh figures
(smiling)
You mustve talked his ear off trying
to get him to stay

LAURIE
Thats not true I didnt say
anything Curt just said at dinner
tonight he realized there was no big
hurry He thought he should take it
easy for a while go to JC and try
to figure out what he wants to do
with his life

STEVE
That sounds logical

Lauries expression changes

LAURIE
You think so

STEVE
Sure I think Curts probably right
for Curt Not for me though Laurie
look at me Now you know what I want
out of life And its just not in
this town

LAURIE

and they

Im not going to the airport tomorrow

She looks sullen and he smiles a little He tur

ns her
and gently kisses here They begin to make out Laurie
seeming

a little desperate Steve pushes her slowly down on the
seat

He moves on top of here and his hand begins to wander

LAURIE
Steve Dont

STEVE
(quietly)
Its our last night together for
three months come on

LAURIE
Weve been through this before

STEVE
Im going to miss you so much I
need something to remember you by
You dont want me to forget you

She closes her eyes trying not to cry

LAURIE
(softly)
No

He starts to move on top of her kissing her neck She

struggles for a few moments then goes limp not
responding

He pulls away angrily

STEVE
Whats wrong Youre just lying there

LAURIE
Well go ahead you want to

STEVE
Not like that

LAURIE
If youre not going to remember me
for anything else why dont you go
ahead

STEVE
You want it and you know it Dont
be so damn self-righteous with me
After those things you told me about

She reaches past him and pulls the door handle

swings open and she shoves Steve out Then she

engine and drives away leaving Steve standing

The

starts

there in

darkness In the distance he hears the laughter of

couples and the drifting music from their radios

THE CANAL ROAD

Terry and Debbie walk slowly along the dark canal

takes a large slug of his bourbon and coke

DEBBIE
Anyway the Goat Killer--

TERRY
Lets talk about something else

DEBBIE
--Whenever he strikes he leaves a
bloody goats head near the victim
Isnt that creepy

Terry thinks about it and indeed it is He looks around

the darkness and then takes Debbies hand

DEBBIE
They thought he went up to Stockton
but two nights ago they found Carlie
Johnson and Don White right here by
the canal all hacked to pieces and--

TERRY

Who do you thinkll take the regionals

DEBBIE
--not only were there bloody goats
heads but he had switched all the
parts of their bodies around You

legs on--

Terry is slowing and he stops her He motions for her

to
shut up and they listen The wind whines across the
flat
valley Ahead there is only darkness then footsteps
TERRY
Wait a second Did you hear
DEBBIE
You think its the Goat Killer
TERRY
(whispering)
No I mean no Listen Ill go for
help you stay here
Terry has turned and is starting off when she grabs him
by
his shirt-tail
DEBBIE
Come on well hide in the field
She takes Terrys hand and they go off behind some
bushes

away from the black water
Debbie looks through the bushes squinting

DEBBIE
Maybe if its the Goat Killer hell

thing

Terry stands with his eyes closed

TERRY
I dont want to see the whole thing
Especially if its us he--oh why

your legs and a goats head and--

DEBBIE

She edges off to get a better view
TERRY
Well as long as hes not--Debbie

Debbie

Shes gone Terry starts off taking one step turns

takes
another turns takes another Suddenly Terry hears
something
behind him He turns very slowly and looks
A figure is standing right behind him silhouetted by
the
moon its face obscured Terry jumps about three feet
and
yells
STEVE (0S)

Terry stops yelling seeing that its Steve

area Everything is dark and quiet as the adult
sleeps through the night John pulls the coupe to the
and turns off the engine He turns out the lights
Inside the car theres silence Only the clock

his

mind A door opens and Budda Macrae comes in She
watches

Steve looks up as she comes over on her roller skates

BUDDA

back out to cruise Only the car hops who have

late-hour harried look suggest its nearly closing

The Pharoahs arrive The Mercury swings imperiously
lot The radio can be heard as the rumbling engine
Clovers are singing Love Potion 9

Curt jumps out of the Mercury elated The Pharoahs all
out and circle him punching him playfully Joe holds
while Carlos tickles him and they all laugh

chariot

little

Citroen

WOLFMAN (VO)
My my my You only got five minutes

sees the white Thunderbird gliding by He sits up

quickly

and tries to start the Citroen--but the machine barely
turns

over He keeps trying desperately but the engine wont
catch

CRUISING G STREET--58 EDSEL

Laurie drives slowly alone in the Edsel On the radio
the

Skyliners are lamenting the sad state of things--Since

music

A horn honks She looks over to see Bob Falfas car

off
Laurie thinks a while pouting She pulls alongside

and he turns Laurie motions him to pull over
Falfa looks surprised The light changes and he
to the curb Laurie takes a deep breath and with a
look gets out and walks back to his car She gets in
closes the door They start off He looks over and
FALFA
Hey Hey Hey baby what do you say
LAURIE

Falfa is puzzled by the frigidity in the air He

her then back at the road wondering about this strange

RESIDENTIAL STREET--DEUCE COUPE
The coupe slows in front of a modest California ranch-
home John stops the car and turns off the engine He

over at Carol who seems lost in thought

JOHN

CAROL

She jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the
house

He watches her stop at the screen door and turn She
gives

him a little wave then goes inside
and is

beside

John looks over at the empty seat next to him and seems

little sad He starts the engine and drives off slowly

WOLFMAN (VO)

I havent cried so much And the

tears and everything man

I leaned

down towards the microphone and I

almost shorted myself out

ALLEY BEHIND THE COME ON INN BAR

A half dozen people are standing around in the parking

behind the bar Debbie is sitting on the hood of a car
swinging her legs and chewing gum The people all seem

watching something on the ground behind the car
heard then gagging and the unmistakable sounds of

being sick
At the back door of the bar even the cooks are looking
and

pointing We hear more coughing and vomiting A guy
slides

up on the hood next to Debbie

GUY
I never seen a guy lose so much He
mustnt have been used to drinking

DEBBIE
Oh no he really likes to drink He

An old man looks at his watch and then up at the stars

OLD MAN
Gettin late I knew a man once

More groaning and gaggin is heard An old woman moves

to the old man and he puts an arm around her
sentimentally

OLD WOMAN

He looks like a dog doesnt he

OLD MAN

The people drift off leaving Debbie sitting alone on
the

car Now Terry slowly emerges pulling himself up the
hood

of the car His face is white He lies across the hood
trying

to catch his breath

TERRY
Ohh rats I feel like--

nearby and pushes
himself up)

ALLEY BEHIND THE COME ON INN BAR--STEVES 58 CHEVY
Terry is fiddling around under the dashboard trying to
wire the Chevy As the wires connect the radio comes

life and the Wolfman growls

WOLFMAN (VO)
Who is this on the Wolfman telephone

Theres the sound of a phone ringing then the
voice of the Big Bopper answering

BIG BOPPER (V0O)
Hellooo baaaby--

Just then Terry looks up and sees one large badass
at him Terry gets up slowly and sees another big guy
nearby The first badass reaches in and grabs Terry by

shirt He pulls him from the car Terry is smiling

TERRY
Ah hi--this is my car What I mean

The first badass shoves Terry toward the other badass

TERRY

pummel Terry Then she sees the yellow deuce coupe

John glances out his window and notices the fight

Come On Inn He punches it and wheels into a fast U-

The hoods have quit playing with Terry and are punching
Terrys still on his feet mostly because hes drunk
staggering away from a lot of the blows also Debbie
screaming and pelting the assailants with her purse
DEBBIE

Stop it stop it stop it Help

John jumps out of the coupe and runs into the parking
He grabs one of the punks and turns him--smashing him
face The punk lands on his ass John starts circling

other

TERRY

DEBBIE
Hit him

A good fighter John lands a couple of blows to the gut

Terry manages to raise his head

TERRY
Youre talking to the woman I love

His head falls back again

JOHN
What happened man

Terry opens his mouth to start to explain but its too

hard

He can only moan

MELS DRIVE-IN

The drive-in is emptying out finally as the midnight
hour

approaches and passes The die-hards and the hard-ups
are

still wheeling through Mels looking for remains of any

action

Steve sits inside in a booth Two gossipy looking girls
come

in smiling and slide into the booth across from him

STEVE
Hi Karen Judy

JUDY

The name registers with Steve

Terry and Debbie pull into the drive-in and park
Terry his
face swelling groans as he leans toward the intercom

TERRY
Help I mean I want two cherry
cokes with lots of ice Never mind

The intercom repeats his order in a foreign language
and
suddenly Steve arrives and opens the door

STEVE

Terry gets out and Debbie gets out her side Steve gets
in

Terry shrugs standing in the empty stall the carhop
the trays and Debbie watching Theres a low rumbling
and the girls turn as Johns deuce coupe glides into

stall next to them Terry shuffles toward Johns car a
defeated man

Terry leans against Johns car and John looks out the

at him

And the radio plays Cryin in the Chapel

John smiles and gets out of the car He goes and opens
his

hood making a last-minute check on something Terry
sits

down gently on a curb by John Debbie has been talking
with

some other boys Eventually she wanders up slowly and
looks

at Terry He looks up at her then away disgraced and

embarrassed She sits down by him and theyre silent

She smiles walks off swinging her purse She looks
over
her shoulder and smiles He smiles back
OUTSIDE RADIO STATION--CITROEN
The little Citroen bumps along a lonely dirt road
winding
its way through dark peach orchards and wizened grape
vineyards Curt watches the deserted landscape when
suddenly
the radio increases in volume and he turns it down
Then it

begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes
more
powerful Then Curt sees it

He stops the car and gets out He stands looking at an
isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight

Curt

looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward
the

stars its black wires humming in the stillness

Curt starts up the gravel walk to the door Under the
glare

of a naked spotlight he sees a small intercom which
plays

soft Rock and Roll He hesitates then pushes a buzzer
He

pushes it again and finally a voice comes over the
intercom

VOICE (VO)
Yeah who is it

CURT
Its--I want to talk to the Wolfman

VOICE
The Wolfman aint here

CURT

Wolfman would be upset if he knew a
friend couldnt get in touch with--

A buzzer interrupts him and the door opens an inch
pushes it open slowly--no one is there A little

goes inside and closes the door

INSIDE RADIO STATION

Curt walks slowly down a dark eerie corridor passing
strangely lit rooms with electronic generators humming
dynamos and glassed-off booths filled with flashing
apparatus

Curt goes through this other-worldly maze until he

a small dimly lit control booth A figure inside is
visible through the reflections in the double glass

The figure turns and walks up to the window Curt backs

a bit A face stares at him--long hair greased in a

a short chinbeard Then he speaks his voice filtering
strangely through a hidden speaker

MANAGER
What do you want

Through the window Curt can be seen but no sound is
MANAGER
Pull the red switch

CURT
Im looking for a girl

MANAGER

Curt walks around through a few more glass doors and

in the booth with the manager

The manager sits down and leans back turning a fan to
he

stands

He

and

tape

on his large chest Hes a large friendly looking man

awkwardly

CURT
No Thanks Listen ah

MANAGER

CURT

MANAGER

The manager leans forward and picks up a spool of tape
holds it up as a magician would for audience

then puts it on a machine A record is about to end As
does the manager punches some buttons and the record
into a Wolfman howl and then the distinctive Wolfman
takes over The manager adjusts the monitor volume down
sucks his popsicle

WOLFMAN (VO)
Who is this on the Wolfmans

Curt goes out the door He starts back out through the
of windows and electronic machines Echoing throughout
rooms the Wolfmans raucous voice follows Curt The
howls and Curt turns

Through the maze of glass shifting like prisms he
station manager sitting by the mike--howling Then he
and howls again starting to sing a song called

on My Dingaling pounding out the rhythm on the

CURT
Wolfman
He backs away leaving the Wolfman whos on his feet
screaming out the end of the song dancing by himself
little glass room from which his voice radiates out
the night and around the world
MELS DRIVE-IN

Chevy drives into the parking lot The radio is now

Heart and Soul Terry moves over toward Johns car

doesnt look up although he is quite aware of Falfas

entrance

Falfa slows down in front of Johns car and revs his

again John looks up--Laurie is in the car with Falfa

in

Onions

Terry

and

for the night Curt stops next to the lighted phone
and sits in his car listening to the Wolfman

WOLFMAN (VO)

The Wolfman howls and Curt smiles leaning his chin on

hand looking around the dark drive-in wondering about
tomorrow

PARADISE ROAD--DAWN

Johns 32 yellow deuce coupe and Falfas black 55

are waiting side by side on a long straight country
their front wheels resting on a weather-beaten starting

The sky is getting lighter as the radio plays Green

There are about six to eight other cars parked off the
to watch the race Everything is quiet now only the
ignoring the solemnity of the scene and still singing
jumps out of Johns car John hands him the flashlight
he takes up a position in front of the two cars

John looks over at Falfa whos arguing with Laurie

JOHN
Hey--Laurie what in the hell are

LAURIE
Mind your own business John

FALFA
Yeah shes with me You worry about

TERRY
Everybody ready

John settles back in the drivers seat and positions
hand on the gear-shift which we see is wrapped with
because of the missing knob

Both drivers start revvin their engines the tension
Terry looks nervous the engines start to scream and
his hands shaking on the flashlight manages to flash
Both cars roar off the starting line tires smoking and
screaming Terry has his hands over his head and is

in a cloud of smoke as they pass John beats Falfa off
line

Out on the road as they hit third gear the cars are
neck and neck Inside Falfas car Laurie looks scared
death Falfa looks insane as he tromps it

John hits fourth at about eighty-five Falfa does

but starts to fish-tail Laurie closes her eyes almost
Falfa regains control nervously

Falfas engine is winding out incredibly and he begins
get the edge on John The cars rocket through the dawn
along the flashing white line until suddenly Falfas

blows a tire his front wheel slips off and the car
begins

smo ke--

halt
tailing it

bullet

Steve who

same

up

John

manages to
at the
crouching

motions

state

is

off into a tomato field hits an irrigation ditch and

flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and

John sees the Chevy leaving the road and screams to a
swimming through an unbelievable U-turn and high
back to the crash site He is out of the car like a
running across the dirty cloddy field The crash car is
beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is
panicked
Meanwhile the spectators have arrived including
jumps from his car and is running across the field
Steve and John arrive at the fire at approximately the
time They stop the flames are getting higher burning
into the trees now Steve looks around wildly--he sees
and goes at him
STEVE

You stupid sonofabitch she was in

that car Why did you have--
He takes a couple of swings at John who finally
tackle him around the waist They both get up looking
flaming wreckage Then John moves around the side
trying to see past the flames--suddenly he stands and
to Steve to come over They both circle the wreck
Around behind the flaming car Falfa is standing in a
of shock watching the car go up in smoke while Laurie
circling him screaming and beating him with her purse

LAURIE
I said I didnt--you lousy greasy

jerk You coulda killed me--whats
wrong with you You clubfoot
She beats at him crying hysterically Steve runs over
and

grabs her pulling her away She fights at Steve too
not

knowing whats going on

LAURIE
No no no Please dont come near
me No please I think Im gonna be
sick Oh Steven

STEVE

Standing in the early light Steve holds her She
throws her
arms around him as the crowd develops along the

irrigation
ditch to watch the flaming car
LAURIE
Oh Steven Oh Steven please dont
leave me Dont leave me Steven
STEVE

LAURIE

STEVE

LAURIE

STEVE

John looks at Falfa whos shaking his head watching
the car
dissolve
JOHN
Come on before she blows
He pulls him off by the neck of the shirt and when
theyre a
few yards off Falfas 55 Chevy does blow--exploding
like a

small A-bomb blowing it into Modesto history
Back on the road John is heading toward his car its

engine
still running its door open Terry runs up trotting
alongside John like a puppy
TERRY
Jeez did you show him Hell probably

JOHN
He was faster
TERRY

John stops by the open door of the deuce coupe Terry
stares

at him and squints against the rising sun

He climbs in too and the deuce coupe drives off slowly
as
the sun rises over the ploughed fields and on the radio
we
hear Only You
MELS DRIVE-IN-DAWN-CITROEN
Curt sleeps in the little car as the sky grows lighter
over
the empty parking lot The phone is ringing in the
booth It
continues to ring Finally Curt becomes aware of it and
opens
his eyes It takes him a moment to remember Then
panicked
he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth

He walks toward the plane and they all wave He looks
around
as he goes up the steps carrying a small bag and a
portable
radio The stewardess smiles as he passes her Above
the
door of the plane it reads RADAR EQUIPPED Curt looks
back
again then goes inside The plane takes off down the
runway

and then climbs up into the sky
INSIDE THE PLANE

Curt listens to the radio as the plane takes off Its

playing

Goodnight Sweetheart As the plane climbs and banks
over

the valley the music fades and the station drifts
between

static and other stationsand then its gone Curt
turns

off the radio and looks out the window

As the plane banks through the window Curt sees the
white

Thunderbird crossing beneath on the small grey ribbon
of

highway Curt watches it Then the planes shadow
ripples

over the car and it too is gone

THE BLUE SKY

As the plane flies off against the blue sky we see
cameos of

Curt and his friends

in
