Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels

By Guy Ritchie

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT

This whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes cards
tapping fingers and mouths We open on a bright pair of eyes One is
bruised and slightly swollen but this does not detract from their
clarity

EDDY

Three card brag is a simple form of poker you are dealt only three
cards and these you cant change If you dont look at your cards
youre a “blind man and you only put in half the stake Three of any
kind is the highest you can get the odds are four hundred and twenty-
five to one Then its a running flush - you know all the same suit
running in order then a straight then a flush then a pair and
finally whatever the highest card you are holding There are some
tell-

tale signs that are valuable I am not going to tell you them because
it took me long enough to learn them but these can only help a
player

not make one So you want to play

DISSOLVE TO BLACK THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN
FADE IN

What have you got

We cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are
turned

over three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed Thats a
good

hand A flush beats my pair What about you

Cut from completed film

Another pair of excited eyes widen to the question We see more cards
a run is revealed

And heres me trying to explain the game to you Hustlers youre all
hustlers

We cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up OK You
got some real money

DISSOLVE TO BLACK MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN
FADE IN
Ed scoops up a large pile of money
Odds chaps you gotta remember the odds

There a loud slam of a door We cut to a wide shot of a policeman
who has just entered It is then revealed that two of the three
players

are also policemen They stand to attention red faced with
embarrassment

SERG
I hope I am not interrupting Comfortable Edward

EDDY
I havent slept for forty-eight hours got a dozen broken ribs can
feel a case of the flu coming on and

SERG

(interrupts)

All right all right dont think I wouldnt like to get rid of you
but before do I need to know whats going on son

EDDY
If you think youre in the dark I am in a black hole blindfolded

DISSOLVE TO BLACK THE MUSIC STARTS

We pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in
the inside of a shotgun The barrels recede further then “boom LOCK
STOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters We
wait for a while as the barrels reappear through the smoke We then
see one smoking barrel boom the other is let off AND TWO SMOKING
BARRELS joins the sentence

EXT STREET (FLASHBACK - DAY

We open on a smart casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery
on a street corner A crowd has gathered attracted by the alarming
volume at which he is advertising his wares

BACON

See these goods they never seen daylight moonlight Israelite
Fanny-

by-the-gas-light If you cant see value here today youre not up here
shopping youre up here shoplifting Take a bag take a bag I tooka
bag I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten
pounds I can tell ya Tell me if I am going too cheap Not ninety not
eighty not forty half that and half that again thats right ten
pounds Dont think cos its sealed up its an empty box The only
man

who sells empty boxes is the undertaker and by the look of some of
you

here today I would make more money with me measuring tape

A well-dressed zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd
waving money It seems he cant wait to get rid of it

EDDY
Bargain thats a bloody bargain if I ever heard one Ten pounds you
say Ill have five

Certainly sir Ill just wrap
Changing his attention

BACON
Excuse me misses sorry sir ladies first and all that

A tourist spectator rather than a buyer has been put on the spot
She fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of
the crowd of which she is now the focus She passes her money like
its contaminated Others follow suit

Buy em you better buy em theyre not stolen they just never been

paid for

This really stokes the fire The money cant come fast enough Just as
business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first
enthusiastic punter who seems to be rather more familiar than he
first

pretended

EDDY
Bacon

Bacons expression changes dramatically A series of crash zooms
between Eds Bacons and a third partys eyes (the police) reveal
there is a problem Theyre off EDDY and BACON run like they have
done

this before They go down an ally Ed jumps some stairs we freeze

BACON

(voice-over)

Ed can run fast talk fast eat fast and play cards fast but hes
fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz

EDDY

(voice-over)

The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the
police station that people thought he was one of them But he is a big
boy now and it is time to move on
We cut to a shot of Ed as he lands He has made good distance
INT GROCERS SHOP - MORNING

the Greek

TOM

INT RESTAURANT KITCHEN -AFTERNOON

is obviously a smart and serious establishment They stop in front of
the man whose uniform is covered in blood he appears to be the head
chef Meet Soap

TOM

SOAP

surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route Never mind
that what about the money

SOAP
Get your fingers out of my soup

SLOW MOTION
Soap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting

TOM

(voice-over)

unlawful behaviour He is proud of his job and even more proud that
its legal

doesnt know it Cut from completed film

(voice-over)

When the old bastard is not playing cards hes chasing a thousand

stone cold heart

HATCHET

A glossy Christies brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique
hammer-lock shotguns is shoved in Barrys face

It seems Lord Appleton Smythe has run out of money and these little
beauties are up for auction but I am not paying quarter of a million
quid for em if you know what I mean Barry One of my associates has
given me an address and the location of these lovelies Make sure we
get everything from inside the gun cabinet I dont want to know who

INT TORTURE ROOM - DAY

Meet the Dog Dog is horrible He is large and intimidating
Administering pain is Dogs forte He is also the Guy we cut from the
last scene ‘slap to the teeing of a golf ball Wallop Dog pulls a
sadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face

DOG
Its a dog eat dog world lads and I got bigger teeth than you

We see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but
otherwise naked An orange is stuck in the mans mouth Dog is
standing

on another mans chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from
where

Dog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure The tied-up man
is Gordon The other is Slick Gordon nods his head erratically
implying that he has reached a decision

(to Plank)
I think your man is trying to say something

Pause
Perhaps not maybe I should have another swing just to make sure

Agonised muffled screaming from Gordon Slick (who has a tee in his
mouth) shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into Gordon

Yes Gordon is there something you would like to tell us
The orange is removed from Gordons mouth

GORDON
(rushing to get the words out)
In the kitchen under the floor

SLICK
(interrupts)
Shut it you idiot

Dog swings the golf club round Slicks jaw knocking him unconscious

DOG
You were saying

GORDON

gods sake let me down

PLANK
Oh Dog I think you want to have a look at this

Plank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash Gordon starts
to

scream Dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it
across

the room Thunk Silence follows Plank grimaces

looking at his plate distastefully

BACON
Twenty-five from me Tom Soap and yourself a hundred grand to the
pound You dont need to count it
EDDY

TOM

(eating)

So a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and
twenty for twenty-five grand invested Thats going on previous
experiences

SOAP
Thats going on optimism

TOM
Whatever its going on its still enough to send you on a cooking
course

SOAP
Youre not funny Tom youre fat and look as though you should be
funny but youre not

Tom is definitely not overweight quite the opposite in fact He
examines himself to see if something has developed

TOM
Fat Who are you calling fat What are all these fat jokes about

The light switch above Toms head lets out a few sparks causing him to
cower in a sharp defensive action

Jesus Its good in here aint it Trains overhead walls exploding
Why the hell did you move in

EDDY
Because its cheap like a budgie

BACON
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to
a bit anti-social you know

BACON beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall

TOM
What do you mean

EDDY
He means theyre thieving dogs

BACON
I mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop theyre ripping
off unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs

noise from next door immediately gets louder

pulled over only half his face A sexy thigh grip is replicating an
artificial frilly moustache not giving the desired menacing look A
big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top

DEAN
Cant you pull that stocking down further Kenny

At that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun
cartridge The ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance He is
holding an equally ancient pair of hammer-lock guns (the ones from the
catalogue) which he has obviously got little control of The recoil
knocks the butler clear off his feet The second shot hits the ceiling
covering the old boy in plaster

We cut to a POV of the butler on his back We see Dean looking down

You want to be more careful old fella You very nearly took my mans
head clean off with that You all right Kenny

We cut to a shaking shell-shocked Gary mouth agape The gun shot has
torn through the centre of Garys bouffant hairdo leaving him with a
pair of smoking Mickey Mouse ears Shock prevents him from answering
Kenny

BOXING GYM - NIGHT

Stakes have increased dramatically There is a pause as Frazer looks
at
his cards

EDDY

HATCHET

BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT
Barry who is trying as hard as he can to see Eds cards frustratedly

zooms in and out eventually Ed raises them just
enough Barry jibs hey bingo he sees Eds cards
Eds got nothing but a pair of sixes Barry excitedly starts tapping
away

INT BOXING GYM - MGHT

EDDY
One hundred grand

FRAZER
Hold on fellas I know

HATCHER (interrupts j
I know youre not in which means nobody cares what you know Two
hundred and fifty

Hatchet and EDDY minutely study each others hairlines waiting for a
nervous droplet to appear Sweat breaks a drop on Eds forehead
fills

frame Slowly we follow a droplets journey coursing down Eddys brow
Eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye at this point the
pause is broken

EDDY
That is quite a raise one hundred and fifty on my hundred

HATCHET
Yes and is there something else you want to say EDDY

As you know this puts us in an awkward position I dont have enough
to continue

Pause

CROUPIER
We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to
continue Its a loan or we see both your cards

Silence follows A lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary
dirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining
company

It doesnt look
HATCHET
(interrupts)

I will

EDDY
You will what
HATCHET
I will loan you the money

Silence The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Eds chin trembles for
a

second then unattaches itself Very slowly it falls We follow its
long silent journey Eventually it is greeted by the back of Eds
cards It explodes dramatically in sound and vision symbolizing this
worrying news

EDDY
I think I would rather just turn them over

HATCHET

I am not interested in what you would rather I want to keep going I
am also offering you the money so we dont have to turn them over
because you can borrow

EDDY
I need two hundred and fifty grand

HATCHET
No you need five hundred grand to see me

Eds face is now awash busily blistering with sweat

EDDY
Thats if I want to see you

HATCHET
Well youre going to have a problem carrying on aintcha

The pause is painful

CRUOPIER
You can still fold

EDDY doesnt like the sound of this There is sympathy in her voice
Harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier the
croupier

pleads with Eddy

EDDY
Ill see ya

HATCHET
For half a million

EDDY
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid

HATCHET

And still got a sense of humour Thats not monkey nuts son you can
still fold

(Pause)

OK before I loan you this I expect if you lose of course my money
back within a week Crystal Thats Sunday OK

These last few words echo in the distance of Eds mind (and ours) He
is committed but has now left the world of the conscious Hatchet
turns over the first card its a seven EDDY

ushers him on another seven it looks as though he will have three
then the third its a four There is an anti-climatic silence After
a

loud pause

CROUPIER
Is that it

Cut from completed film

FRAZER
He was bluffing

Hatchet looks content and rather nonchalant

HATCHET
Lets see your fucking cards

Nobody is impressed by Hatchets cards all eyes fall on EDDY
expectantly We crash in to Eds pupils with a loud swoosh They
contract to the size of pinheads His world has changed for ever

FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY

EDDY

(voice-over)

I knew he was bluffing but somehow the worst card player round the
table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens A
series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted
with a grin compared to this Ten minutes earlier I was two hundred
thousand pounds richer now I owed half a million

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY
Harry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear

HATCHET
I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash so Ill
give

you all a week to find it After that Ill take a finger off each of
you and your friends hands for each day that passes without payment
and when you have all run out of digits then who knows what

Ed gets up We stumble with him in slow motion He is hardly able to
stand He wobbles over to the door Harry continues to talk over the
top

Business is business and I am good at making mine work I like your
dads bar JDs so dont get clever or lethargic If you cant pay in
a week a few fingers and a bar for starters

Ed stumbles out of the door doubles up and vomits all over the f
door

INT SAMOAN JOS - NIGHT

Ed has made his way into the bar All his friends have fallen asleep
One of Bacons eyes opens to see Ed cleaning himself up

BACON
This doesnt look good

The others wake on this statement We cut between the lads and their
frozen reaction

FREEZE SHOT OF LADS IN SHOCK

EDDY

(voice-over)

I then explained the unfortunate position we were in Harry was going
to start sizing up all our fingers in a week cause he knew there was
no way I could raise that kind of money on my own Harry saw it as
their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table I
hate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that If
I

said I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF LADS

EDDY
Listen I wish he would let me settle it on my own

Tom drops his drink and rushes Eddy

TOM
Ill kill him
BACON

Stop fucking around Tom and think What are we going to do

INT HATCHET HARRYS OFFICE - NIGHT

BACON

(voice-over)

Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry Once there was this geezer called
Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry It was rumoured that he was on
the take Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation Smithy didnt
do a very good job Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached
for the nearest thing at hand which happened to be a fifteen-inch
black rubber cock He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death
with this that was seen as a pleasant way to go Hence Hatchet
Harry is a man you pay if you owe

EDDY
Ill think of something dont worry

EXT STREET - DAY

Ed who looks like he is close to suicide has developed a two-day
stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets He stumbles
along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket He

of “how you doing way to everyone and goes to take a seat At the

notes

BACON
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days its hit him
hard

SOAP

BACON
Yeah but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar

Tom who has not really been listening suddenly interrupts

TOM
Listen to this one then you open a company called the Arse Ticklers
Faggot Fan Club You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag
advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos sell it a bit with
er
I dunno ‘does what no other dildo can do until now latest and
greatest in sexual technology Guaranteed results or money back all
that bollocks These dills cost twenty-five each a snip for all the
pleasure they are going to give the recipients They send a cheque to
the company name nothing offensive er Bobbies Bits or something
for twenty-five You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them
clear Now this is the clever bit Then you send back the cheques for
twenty-five pounds from the real company name Arse Ticklers Faggot
Fan Club saying sorry we couldnt get the supply from America they
have sold out Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques

not a single soul because who wants his bank manager to know he
tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques

There is a long pause while BACON considers this

BACON
So how long do you have to wait till you see a return

TOM
Probably no longer than four weeks

BACON

(voice-over)

What do you know about Chris eh You put Big Chris on a job and he
will make sure it gets done no matter whats in his way His dad used
to collect debts and his dad before that and that monster of a boy
will after he has gone It seems that the Almighty himself requested
them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old
Nicks door himself if he was behind on his payment But he has never
nicked a picker in his life Straight as an arrow and as strong as the
bow that fired it If you dropped your tenner he would search till he
found ya the only problem is he isnt stable has a temper like
a

runaway train and he hits twice as hard Heaven protect anyone who
touches that boy not that the boy needs protecting

We see Big Chris walking up the stairs He reaches the top and knocks
on the door

Harry leans the gun against the side of the desk and takes a seat
does

a breast-stroke movement to clear his desk of all the sexual debris
takes a big breath of air and begins

HATCHET

I want you to forget about any other debts at the moment there are
fresher fish to fry

Barry pulls a kind of mock-scared face and clutches his heart

HATCHET
Oh careful JD youll give Barry a heart-attack

We crash-zoom again into Harrys eyes to see the pupils contract Its
time to look mean

Ill put that down to shock but only once only once can or will I

second sentence

INT DOGS HDUSE - DAY

There is no such thing as easy in my experience and if you think this
is going to be easy youre a dick It may be easier than most but
its

not going to be easy

INT ED AND BACONS HOUSE - DAY

BACON has a kettle next to where he is sitting It steams away quite
happily but a worrying noise starts to come from the plug socket
BACON

prepares himself- BOOM He disappears into black

INT DOGS HOUSE - DAY

They react to the BOOM Dog looks at the wall with suspicion misses a
beat then continues

DOG

Whats that idiot doing next door

(Points at Paul)

We use your van Its up some stairs this place so well stick out
like balls on a bulldog Plank is going up first There is a cage but
it is never locked is it Plank

PLANK

And it better bloody not be Once he is firmly in place he gets the
rest of us in Well get nasty with a couple of them shit em up

good

place to hide next door When it sounds like the right time we jack
in

the box look nasty and stuff cocoon them in gaffer tape then we
nick

their van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back
here

As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly its the last
thing theyll expect If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them
around a bit I am sure it wont do any harm A bit of pain never hurt
any one (thinking about it) if you know what I mean Also I
think

knives are a good idea you know big fuck-off shiny knives the ones
that look like they could skin a crocodile Knives are good because
they dont make any noise and the less noise the more were likely to
use them Thatll shit em up and make us look like pros

There is a pause as they look at Soap with suspicion

What are you doing Plank

PLANK

J has found it all too much and has passed out with fear collapsing
on

the floor in an awkward contorted position Plank is desperately
trying

to find the right key Things are not going as well as planned Dog
in

the meantime has decided its time to start the show

EXT SLOANES STAIRS - DAY

DOG
Go Go Go Fucking run you two

They all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into
Plank The keys go flying out of Planks hands and through the cage
Plank cries with frustration reaching out with his hand to retrieve
them Dog finding the gate locked is none too happy They are also
still exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space
between

the outside door and the inside cage

the pressure being applied

PLANK
(trying to convince himself as much as Dog)

DOG

The gun with which Plank has been entrusted is pointing straight at
Dogs groin
Point your gun in there dick not at me

Mick has unwrapped his gun from his case Dog turns and looks amazed
at
the size of the weapon

What the fuck is that

MICK

DOG

You could have brought something a bit more fucking practical

PLANK
(trying to salvage some credibility)
Dont you stags move or Ill kill the lot of ya

DOG
(amazed by this stupidity)
Who are you going to kill Plank Theres no one there

We hear another pop and Plank gets shot in the neck This
understarulably sends him into a real panic thinking this is
curtains

PLANK
(gurgle)
They shot me

Panic unashamedly exposing itself Trickles of blood start flowing
from
in-between Planks fingers

DOG
(unimpressed)

Well shoot them

Plank shoots at everything and nothing Smoke fills the corridor
leaving them in a cloud A bit of coughing goes on then silence

JOHN

Jesus Plank you could have got smokeless cartridges I cant see a
bloody thing

Pop Another pellet is fired hitting John in the chest

Ah Jesus shit Ive been shot
DOG
I dont fucking believe this Could everybody stop getting shot Sit
down John you cock patch yourself up its only a fucking air rifle

Dog is interrupted by an enormously loud blast of machine-gun fire
Dog

and the boys panic cover their ears and hit the floor After this
outburst Dog looks up at Mick and sees he is the culprit Mick looks
down at Dog expecting a congratulatory nod from Dog he doesnt get
it

What the fuck was that

MICK
That was the bren gun

94 95

DOG
If you use that again youre a dead man do you understand

He speaks softly but he is quite shaken He then raises his voice he
has had enough of all this mincing

Right fellas

He shouts to the Sloanes while dragging the semi-conscious body of J

up
to use as a shield

Before I go any further I am going to shoot your mates toes off

No sooner said than done his toes go The smoke problem repeats
itself
and J faints again but an unfazed Dog continues

Now if you want us to be gone in two minutes open the fucking gate

Dutch courage hacks straight
off and William loses a

as he tries to push the barrel to the side He starts screaming

uncontrollably

DOG
(to Plank)
Give us your knife

Dog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to
its source William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog

and

slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck holding a bleeding hand

(the point of the blade resting on Williams throat)

Enough Mick how you doing
MICK
How do you think I am doing He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off

Dogs attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash neatly
packed and stacked

TRAFFIC WARDEN

PAUL

Thats the last bag

DOG
(Turning to Mick)
How about you All right

MICK
Ill be fine when have dealt with this little shit Mick grabs the
machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun

DOG
Do it quietly

Gloria who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and
troop has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising
the gravity of the situation She is kick-started into action by the
sure demise of Willie The machine gun has been placed not too far
away
from her She picks it up and fires it into the already wounded body
of Mick who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat
Gloria who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself
knew existed destroys everything she points at Bodies jump for cover
and Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best
Eventually the gun which seems to have a limitless supply of lead
goes quiet We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes
cautiously Looks of relief come from everyone not least the Sloanes
Dog who is closest stands walks straight up to her and punches her
on the jaw Gloria is knocked out

What was that Where did she come from Thats fucking it Tie her up
We are getting out of here

miss the end of the game so calm as a coma he stands and picks up a
fire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are
ready for action then he plonks it outside the entrance He then

switches back to his footer “Thats fucking it says the man Rory
gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty he flicks a flaming match

INT HATCHET HARRYS OFFICE - DAY

We cut to a time Lapse Hatchet puts down the phone while resting his
bum on the front of his desk He is ecstatic with the guns He loads
and plays with them aiming at imaginary moving birds

The door is suddenly kicked wide open and lo and behold there is a
Scouser standing in the door Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying
through his troubled mind most of which are based an regretting the
decision to kick this door in “shit what the hell is that and why
is
he holding a shotgun Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the
doorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver
holding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail The pair
are blissfully unaware that employee has met employer Hatchet Harry
has effectively contracted his own demise The pause is eventually
shattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual
triggers

There is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective
targets Both barrels are emptied into Deans chest The Scourer is
airborne by the sheer power of the cartridges One of Deans
bulletsfinds its way into Harrys shoulder Gary can do nothing to
stop this atrocity He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past
him

Overtaken by emotion or fear Gary charges in gun blazing and
proceeds to perforate Hatchet who is now unarmed Hatchet flies over
his desk Gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one
last
bullet into Hatchet who is lying on the chair side of his desk It is
then revealed that Barry is sitting in his chair behind the door The
Scourer cant see Barry and Barry cant see Garys face Barry throws
the hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butchers block It hits
Gary in the back Gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet
in

Barrys stomach It is then clear to them both that this has all been
a

terrible mistake

BARRY GARY
What are you doing here

Then both collapse into dead lumps on the floor

Big Chris starts his car up looks across to make sure that Little
Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road He gets
faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife
Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle
BANG Dog goes flying forward hitting the windscreen

Dont think I wouldnt like to get rid of you but before I do I need
to know whats going on Edward

EDDY
If you think youre in the dark I am in a black hole blindfolded

The camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a
policeman There is a long pause far consideration Eventually he
shakes his head

TRAFFIC WARDEN
No thats not one of them

The policeman then knocks on the door
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

The SERG looks round to see the policeman They exit and Ed is left on
his own After a short pause the door bursts open

INT JDS BAR - NIGHT

All the lads are sitting in the bar Ed is talking to Tom who is
interested in whatever he has to say

EDDY

The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot
so

that put us sort of in the clear They got no case against us because
there is no evidence against us

BACON
Apart from those shotguns

EDDY
And Tom took care of them

Pause while Tom looks embarrassed about something

SOAP
You did take care of the guns didnt you Tom

Ed looks at Tom who looks even more embarrassed
TOM
I wanted to talk to you about that

BACON
Well talk

TOM

Well not exactly no I got em sitting in the car actually I
thought

we might sell them back to the Greek but I am having a bit of a
problem getting hold of him

BACON

You dippy bastard

EDDY
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car
which is sitting outside

TOM

We paid seven hundred quid for those guns They could hardly trace
them

to you could they

SOAP
I dont think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid

EDDY
Tom go and throw those guns off a bridge

BIG CHRIS
I have got something for ya Well for your boy actually

JD
Well I suggest you speak to him then

They all look rather shocked He is carrying their bag and he places
it
on the table which increases the shock factor

BIG CHRIS
It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have
cost him I am not going to make the same mistake am I I have

decided to bring your bag back
Pause The words you are looking for start with thank you

EDDY
Thank you

BIG CHRIS

Now you have presented me with a problem I dont have an employer any
more So I have taken care of myself and my son and if you think that
is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit but you better be
waving the white flag high and clear otherwise it will be the last
little visit you lot ever make Thats all I had to say Its
been

emotional

Big Chris turns to walk out The lads stare at the bag and then at
each
other

EXT JDS BAR - NIGHT

INT JDS BAR - NIGHT

Ed goes forward to open the case The rest are still in shock Ed
opens
the bag

EDDY
Theres nothing in it

SOAP
What do you mean

EDDY
I mean its fucking empty

BACON lunges forward and stares in He sticks his hand in and
extracts

an A4 envelope They look puzzled Ed feels the package and starts to
tear the top off As this is done it creates a split screen

On the other side of the picture Tom is on a London bridge with the
car boot open He looks at the guns with regret and give them one last
polish Then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a
handrail

Simultaneously Ed extracts a Sotherbys brochure on shotguns They
still look confused They turn the brochure upside down and recognize
the shotguns Slowly they start to turn the pages

Torn pushes the shotguns over the top rail they fall He starts
walking but stops for some reason He retreads his steps and peers
over the guns had just fallen on to a shelf

Ed sees the price of the guns a series of alarming zooms cut between
eyes and prices They panic and reach for their mobile phones

Tom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail
with
one arm

Ed starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and
asks them to put their phones down
Tom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail His mobile phone
starts to ring in his top pocket he has either to drop the guns or
let

go of the rail to answer the phone

The shot freezes
