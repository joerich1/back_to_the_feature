HANK

Widen to see HANK DEERFIELD cradling the phone sitting on
the edge of his bed You dont have to ask if Hank has seen
war he speaks with the confidence of someone who has been
to hell and mapped the terrain He keeps himself in shape
and is not a man who is often caught off guard which makes
his confusion that much more troubling

EXT DEERFIELD HOME -- MORNING

Theirs is a modest two bedroom home lying a front-yards
distance off the highway An ancient but well maintained
dump truck sits at the back of a long gravel drive front
end jacked up The truck door reads Deerfield Hauling

Hank slides out from under the truck with a tie rod and wrench
in his hand He drops the rod into the box of his 1989 Ford
F150 pickup puts his wrench in the tool chest and pulls off
his coveralls

( )

As the pickup pulls out of the drive we widen to see the
rows of identical houses lining the highway most of them
proudly displaying American flags Welcome to the town of
Munroe Tennessee

INT TRUCK PARTS STORE -- MORNING
Hank waits the busted tie rod on the counter A TV in the

corner plays a press conference about the state of the war
STU the 60ish salesman returns with a new rod

STU
There you go
HANK
Youre sure this one will fit
STU
You gotta trust somebody sometime
Hank
(re TV)

Bet Mike will have some stories to
tell wont he Course now they can
see at night and shoot through
concrete walls almost makes you
sorry for the ragheads Big
difference from our day

HANK
What day was that

HANK
Stu unless Im mistaken the only
action you saw was Kent State Shot

STU

Hank takes the tie rod and leaves
EXT STREETS OF MUNROE TENNESSEE -- MORNING
Hank steps out of the PARTS STORE and gets into his pickup

receptionist The flag is clearly visible from the window

HANK

LENORE
Lenore

HANK

Lenore Have you looked out your

LENORE
This window right here

HANK
This window right here Do you see
anything odd The flag
(nothing)

LENORE
Oh gosh I didnt notice that Oh
dear Well dont you worry I will
have that put right first thing in
the morning

( )

HANK
It is the morning

LENORE
We just get so busy here

HANK
Lenore do you happen to know what
it means a flag flying upside down

LENORE
That someones died

HANK
No--

LENORE
--See I always get that wrong

HANK
--Thats flying at half mast

LENORE
Could mean that the person putting
it up wasnt paying a lot of
attention

She laughs at her own joke as she often does

HANK
Yeah it could But it doesnt
Who raises the flag every morning
the principal

LENORE
Oh good gosh no he comes running
in about one minute before nine no
its Juan our janitor

HANK

by the second)
The janitor raises the flag Who
takes it down at night

Detective Hodge grins as he returns from his tete-a-tete
with the MPs In the background the two MPs stretch the
measuring tape from the center of the road into the field

LT BURKE
Tell me good news Hodge

DETECTIVE HODGE
Looks as if the victim was killed by

The burn site is well past that mark

Hank rounds the corridor with Lt Kirklander who tries one
last time

LT KIRKLANDER
Sgt Deerfield this isnt necessary
and its not the way you want to
remember your son

HANK
Maybe not but its the way he left
this earth so I dont see as I have
a choice

Kirklander sees Hank wont be dissuaded An Army MEDICAL
EXAMINER in a lab coat approaches Kirklander nods to him

INT POLICE STATION -- DAY

Sanders hovers in the doorway of a small cubicle where the
police photographers printer spits out the evenings crime
scene photos

Sanders is drawn into the cubicle mesmerized by the gruesome
color pictures We intercut Sanders watching these images
come out of the printer with the following scene

INT FT RUDD - HOSPITAL - ARMY MES LAB -- DAY
Hank and Kirklander stand on one side of a large stainless

steel table the Army Medical Examiner on the other Between
them lie the charred remains Kirklander watches Hank under

( )

MEDICAL EXAMINER

Working backwards the carbon patterns
show that the body was dismembered
before it was burnt It appears a
knife or similar tool was used but
the blade was dull many of the joints
are shattered rather than severed
The burn patterns tell us the
dismembered parts were stacked and
doused with an accelerant in an
attempt to incinerate the body
ridiculous because you need an oven
to approach an effective temperature
Which means most of the tissue would
have been left intact so the damage
is largely a result of scavengers
stripping the bones

(we see the teeth marks)
Cause of death is going to take more
time to determine but theres
evidence of multiple stab wounds

HANK
How many

MEDICAL EXAMINER
Im sorry

HANK
How many wounds

MEDICAL EXAMINER
With most of the flesh missing we
can only count the blows that made
impact with a bone

HANK
How many of those are there

Only now does the medical examiner begin to understand the
obvious that hes telling all this to the corpses father
He checks his pad looks up

MEDICAL EXAMINER
Forty-two

HANK
(beat )
One knife or several

MEDICAL EXAMINER
-One

INT POLICE STATION -- DAY

The police photographer returns to his cubicle not
particularly surprised to see Sanders standing there

LT KIRKLANDER
If its all right Id like to give
you a call tomorrow before you go
home I have a few questions that--

HANK
Ask them now

LT KIRKLANDER
Â»I can check with records and answer
some of these things -- I take it
your son didnt own a green car

HANK
Mike doesnt own a car

LT KIRKLANDER
A motorist reported seeing a green
sedan parked on the shoulder near
the field Saturday night One theory
is that this was a car-jacking or
robbery gone wrong Theres been a
real uptick in gang activity lately

HANK
Id like to see where he died

LT KIRKLANDER
Im sorry its still an active crime
scene Ill let you know as soon as
you can

( )

HANK
Okay
(silence)
What else you want to ask

LT KIRKLANDER
A lot of the deaths weve seen like
this have been drug related

HANK
(walks off)
Are you asking if Mike was a drug
dealer or just an addict

LT KIRKLANDER
I dont want to be asking anything

HANK
You know the Army does regular drug
tests

LT KIRKLANDER

Not while theyre in Iraq

(produces a small hash

pipe in an plastic bag)
We found this under your sons
mattress It wont go on my report
but why I asklast month we arrested
three soldiers trying to smuggle
heroin in from Kuwait Theyd
arranged to sell it to a local Mexican
gang I understand Mike spoke some
Spanish

HANK
You think my son could have been a
drug mule because he spoke Spanish

LT KIRKLANDER
No because somebody cut off his
hands and his head

Hank turns and walks off Kirklander watches sizing him
up

INT POLICE STATION -- EVENING

Sanders pulls on her jacket and heads out Turning into the
hall she spots Hank on the long wooden bench

SANDERS
I am so sorry about your son

( )

HANK
Show me

SANDERS
Im sorry

HANK
I need to see where he died

SANDERS
Its not our case the murder occurred
on military property

HANK
But you know where it is

SANDERS
There is nothing to see

HANK
Then there shouldnt be a problem
with me seeing it

Sanders sees how hard Hank is trying to hide his pain
EXT MESA LUNA ROAD - KILLING FIELD -- NIGHT

Sanders leans against her blue Ford Taurus in the sickly
yellow wash of the streetlight her car parked the wrong way
on the gravel shoulder high beams failing to illuminate
much of the field where Hank stands Finally

HANK
You people sure as hell know how to
trample a crime scene Ill give you
that

Hank squats where the body was burned and pivots shining
his flashlight at the tumbleweeds and scrub brush

HANK (CONTD)

Suppose you figured it was a good
idea to have everyone you ever met
park on this shoulder

(beat )
If your crime scene boys had known
where to dig theyd have found traces
of blood in the gravel here Its
where he was killed

SANDERS

So you dont see blood but you
know its there

( )

HANK
Yes miss Just like I see how his
body was dragged from here to there

SANDERS
Thats remarkable That ground is
rock hard but you see drag marks

HANK
You go to all the trouble of burning
a body you dont think youd try
and cover your path

Hank hands her the flashlight and walks off across the road
toward the parking lot and the gun store on the far side

HANK (CONTD)
Going to use the restroom

Curious now Sanders takes her flashlight and steps into the
field Hank struts across the road Without looking back

HANK (CONTD)
You might find it easier to drive
around the field You couldnt do
more damage

She throws a look then shines her flashlight on the ground
finally spots a broken base of a tumbleweed -- lifts it and
places it aside She takes another step toward the fire
site and finds another broken weed and puts it aside

EXT D and G GUNS - PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

Hank crosses the parking lot and opens the front door

EXT MESA LUNA ROAD - FIELD -- NIGHT

Sanders lifts a last tumbleweed out of the way and stops at
the fire site She turns and sees the clear trampled path
of where the body was dragged

INT D and G GUNS -- NIGHT

Hank waits JO ANNE steps up to the counter Shes dressed
like shes looking for a man to take her away from here

HANK
Hi I suppose the MPs have been in
asking you questions about what
happened over in that field

( )

JO ANNE
Yes they have Terrible thing

HANK
Im checking it out for the family
You mind if I ask you if you saw
anything going on over there

Her jealous husband RANDY approaches to check out Hank

JO ANNE
Wished we had we wouldve liked to
help We didnt even know what it
was when we smelled it did we honey

Hank doesnt show that his heart just stopped beating

HANK
-Hows that

JO ANNE
That Sunday morning when we drove
into the parking lot We just thought
somebodyd been barbecuing

RANDY
(agreeing)
Smelled like burned meat

HANK
Thanks Mind if I use your restroom

JO ANNE
Through that door Show him honey

INT D and G GUNS - MENS ROOM -- NIGHT

Hank squats on the floor beside the toilet and lets the horror
of his sons body being burned overwhelm him

EXT MESA LUNA ROAD -- NIGHT

Returning to the shoulder Sanders turns and spots a dog in
the field chewing on something Her stomach tells her what
that something is She curses silently as she throws a look
across the road sees Hank coming from the parking lot

Sanders picks up a hand full of pebbles and tosses them toward
the dog who balks but quickly returns She throws a look

in Hanks direction gauges that he hasnt noticed and tosses
another handful in the dogs direction It barely even looks
up this time Hank arrives and steps to the Taurus

( )

HANK
You can tell your MP friends they
should be looking for a blue car

not a green one

SANDERS
Whys that

HANK
Because a blue car under a yellow
light looks green doesnt it
Hank gets in and Sanders looks at her car -- which looks
green in this light Almost angry at herself for not seeing
the obvious she opens her door and gets in

She does a U-TURN and DRIVES OFF HANK watches the dog in
the field

EXT IMPERIAL MOTEL -- NIGHT
Sanders drops him off

HANK
Thanks

SANDERS
It was the least I could do

HANK
Id say thats accurate

And he walks away leaving her wondering why she even tried
to be nice

Lieutenant Burke stands with Detectives Hodge and Wayne all
three pretending not to laugh or look in her direction
Sanders finishes reading the report stands

Hodge and Wayne choke back their laughter

employee arrested for torturing
chickens

MILLARD

Shut up

MILLARD

My boss just doesnt want me humping
his daughter

You see the way you can draw
information out of people People
just like you Emily Thats how
you got promoted from traffic to the
detective squad am I right

SANDERS
Im sorry

LT BURKE
Oh dont be If Wayne and Hodge
could have fucked their way into the
squad they would have too

DETECTIVE HODGE
Wayne would have One of us needs
to know what theyre doing

SANDERS
Ah See thats what concerns me
Having fucked my way into this job
I may not be qualified to piece
together this complex of a crime I
mean take the murder site I would
have never come to the conclusion
that that soldier had been killed on
Army property I would have been
fooled by the signs of struggle on
the shoulder of the road And that
trail of broken brush leading from
there to where he was burned would
have made me think he was killed in
our jurisdiction and moved because

with your fellow detectives Feel
the need to show them up that it

SANDERS
No sir

CHIEF BUCHWALD
So its the Military Police You
think theyre a bunch of boobs and
are gonna bungle the investigation

SANDERS
No sir But lets not pretend we
dont know the Armys real motives
for wanting this case

CHIEF BUCHWALD
When did you discover you had these
psychic powers Detective

SANDERS
So you dont believe the Armys
primary concern will be how this
incident reflects on the Army

CHIEF BUCHWALD
And you see this as a career move
is that it

SANDERS
I dont have a career sir I have a
job I take care of my son and I do
what I am told But this boy died
in a ditch beside one of our streets

SANDERS (CONTD)
Someone burned him like a cord of
wood leaving the animals to chew on
his remains With respect if that
was your son just back from Iraq I
think you wouldnt be quite as happy
about chucking the case off onto
someone else so you would look better
come election time

CHIEF BUCHWALD
That was with respect

SANDERS
That was my intent sir

CHIEF BUCHWALD
Fine I11l think about it and let
you know

SANDERS
Sir every moment we lose in this
investigation is--

CHIEF BUCHWALD
Didnt you just say you would do
whatever you were told

SANDERS
I sometimes exaggerate for effect

CHIEF BUCHWALD
-Hows David

SANDERS
Im sorry

CHIEF BUCHWALD
Your son

SANDERS
Hes doing fine thank you for asking

CHIEF BUCHWALD
That deadbeat ex of yours ever show
up for any of his games

as few people witnessing it as
possible

way Close your eyes

(beat )

Can you feel it

David touches his cheek
HANK (CONTD)
Open your eyes Look at your house
(David turns to face it)
Close your eyes again Which way is
the wind coming from now

David touches the back of his neck

HANK (CONTD)
There you go

( )

He pulls the handkerchief down over the boys eyes spins
him around forwards and backwards much more than the first

time

HANK (CONTD)
Okay Find your way home

David slowly turns until he can feel the slight breeze on
his neck then starts walking directly toward the house
Hank stays squatted watching

INT SANDERS HOME - DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

for the platter to serve

HANK

SANDERS
Please
INT SANDERS HOME - KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Hank scrapes his plate David fills up the sink to wash the
dishes Sanders steps in

SANDERS

INT DAVIDS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

As viewed from the kitchen through the open door David is
in bed Hank sits on the edge silently reading The Chronicles
of Narnia

DAVID
Youre supposed to read it to me

HANK
I cant understand a word of it

DAVID
Do you know any stories

HANK
Im not much of a storyteller

DAVID
Then read the book

Hank considers thinks of something

HANK
You know where your name comes from

DAVID
My mother

HANK
Before that Youre named after
King David Your mother never tell
you that
(David shakes his head)
Yeah that figures

SANDERS

listening from the kitchen reacts but chooses not to
interrupt

IN DAVIDS BEDROOM

HANK (CONTD)
There were two armies assembled the
Israelites and the Philistines they
were both on hills with the Valley
of Elah between them Thats a place
in Palestine You know where that
is

( )

David shakes his head

HANK (CONTD)
It doesnt matter Anyway the
Philistines had a champion a giant
named Goliath

DAVID
Theres a robot named Goliath

HANK
This wasnt him Anyway every day
for 40 days Goliath strode out into
the field and challenged somebody
from the other side to fight him
and nobody would The strongest and
bravest warriors that the king had
were all too scared

DAVID
Why didnt they just shoot him

HANK
They didnt have guns
(beat )

They had arrows but there are rules
to combat You dont shoot somebody
who is challenging you to fight with
a sword So this kid not much
older than you he comes delivering
bread And he says to the king
Ill fight Goliath

DAVID
No way

HANK
True story So the king dressed
David in his own armor but it was
much too big and heavy So David
takes it off He looks around and
finds five smooth stones about yay
big He steps into the field with
his slingshot in his hand And
Goliath comes running yelling this
horrible scream And David lets fly
the stone And hits him in the
forehead Cracks his skull And
Goliath falls down dead

DAVID
So he shot him

( )

HANK

With a rock thats not the same
thing You know how he was able to

beat him
David shakes his head enthralled

HANK (CONTD)
First thing David had to fight

was

his own fear He beat that he beat
Goliath Cause when Goliath charged
David just planted his feet took

aim and waited You know how

much

nerve that took A few more steps

and Goliath would have crushed

him

And then he threw the rock Thats

how you fight monsters Lure

â€˜em

close to you look em in the eye

and smack em down

DAVID
You fight a lot of monsters

HANK
Sure

DAVID
-You win

HANK
If I didnt I would have been
crushed right

David sees the logic Nods

HANK (CONTD)
Okay then You go to sleep

He turns off the light and leaves closing the door behind

him casting the room into darkness
IN THE KITCHEN AND HALL

SANDERS

He likes to sleep with that door

open

HANK

Hank continues on into the dining room

LONG

No maam

( )

SANDERS
So why didnt you say this when you
were questioned

INT USACID OFFICE - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT

BONNER
Because we didnt think Mike would
want his parents to know

SANDERS
-You didnt want his father to
know he got a blow job

BONNER
And was buying drugs I wouldnt
want somebody telling my parents

SANDERS
So what was the fight about

BONNER
Mike was in some dark mood I dont
know why Then he started saying
nasty things to that stripper

SANDERS
Like what

BONNER
Just stuff Im not going to repeat
The womans a stripper not something
on your shoe

SANDERS
Out in the parking lot Penning said
Mike came at you swinging

BONNER
Might have dont recall We thought
finding him some sort of sex would
calm him down But not Mike

SANDERS
You didnt like him much did you
You got in a lot of fights

BONNER
There were people I liked better

( )

SANDERS
So what was different about that
night Was it just that you had a
knife

BONNER

a knife maam

SANDERS

different Someone makes you mad

BONNER
You lost me

SANDERS

power

BONNER
Youve obviously never been in the
Army

8x10 photo out -- black and white a frame from a surveillance

Hank searches for his pickup in the parking lot but cant
seem to recall where he left it The camera rises to reveal
Hank lost in a sea of cars

INT POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE BUREAU -- DAY

Sanders sits studying the files that Kirklander gave her
finding nothing She looks up and sees Hank sitting quietly
in the waiting area Gone is his earlier arrogance he
appears almost broken She stands and approaches

SANDERS
You want to come in

He stands and follows her to her desk where they sit

SANDERS (CONTD)
You were right they couldnt have
done it They were with Mike at the
chicken shack at one

She hands him the folded page that Kirklander gave her

SANDERS (CONTD)
Bonner Penning and Long arrived
back at base twenty minutes later

He looks at the page a black and white frame from a security
camera at the Ft Rudd guard gate -- Penning Long and Bonner
in a car returning to the base The time stamp reads 0126

SANDERS (CONTD)
The field where we found Mikes
remains is a half hour away They
couldnt have even driven there in
time never mind anything else

HANK
They left him there alone at the
chicken shack

SANDERS
--They say Mike wanted to buy drugs

HANK
Thats why they lied

SANDERS

And they say they were with a
prostitute earlier Mike included

( )

HANK
They didnt think Id seen soldiers
using prostitutes
(Sanders shrugs)
They have no idea where Mike went
when they left him who he met

SANDERS
No
(re files on her desk)
I have statements from every other
man in his squad

HANK

She hands them over he leafs through them

SANDERS
If theyre to be believed no one
else saw him after dinner time

Nugent approaches with two evidence bags stuffed full of
clothes

DETECTIVE NUGENT
Lab says no traces of blood on the
clothes or their belongings

SANDERS
Did you look at those clothes One
of the shirts still has crease marks
where it came off the shelf

HANK
(still reading reports)
Clothes are cheap on the base First
thing you do when you get back is
toss every stitch you took with you
There are nine men in an infantry
squad

Sanders tries to comprehend the apparent non-sequitur

SANDERS
--Yes

HANK
They lost one man in Iraq there
should still be seven statements
There are only six

He hands the files to Nugent

( )

DETECTIVE NUGENT
So one of them is on leave

Nugent assumes backup position at his vehicle Sanders takes
the side door She notes Ortiezs blue Chevy in the covered
carpark Nunez and his partner creep up the front steps
WITH HANK - A BLOCK AWAY

His pickup cruises up in time to see

NUNEZ AND HIS PARTNER

-- bang on the front door

DETECTIVE NUNEZ
Police Department open the door

They take the door down with a ram Nunez rushes past Cholos
smoking dope as his partner holds them at gunpoint

HANK
-- is the first to see
ORTIEZ ON THE ROOF

-- bursting out from a trap door and running along the ridge
toward the attached garage

AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

Sanders hears feet clattering on the roof spots Ortiez just
as he jumps off into the alley and disappears Sanders bolts
for the back yard clambering over junk and climbing the

back fence

Nunez slams open the back door and gives chase

FROM A BLOCK AWAY

Hank watches the game unfold sees Nugent run back to his
vehicle wills him to do the smart thing

HANK
Take the street take the street --

Nugent wheels into the alley

HANK (CONTD)
Christ

Hank drops the truck into gear and rolls down the street
turning the corner and paralleling the alley

IN THE BACK ALLEY

We can see why catching Ortiez isnt easy -- this kid runs
and climbs fences like a goat on steroids He bounds a fence
and jumps into a backyard

Sanders scrambles after him but stays in the alley

Nugent swerves through the twisting dirt alley swerving
right before breaking hard at a dead end

Nunez comes around the corner Sanders screams that hes
in the yards Nunez jumps the fence and pursues as

Ortiez leaps from one yard to the next
Nunez tries a fence and misses slamming back onto his ass

Sanders keeps runningbut she can see Ortiez is getting
away

OUT ON THE STREET

Hank cruises scanning the houses and side yards until he
glimpses Ortiez Hank sees where Ortiez is going to cut
into the open He stomps on the accelerator Ortiez bursts
out onto the street Hank catches up to him and swings open
his drivers door slamming Ortiez to the pavement

( )

Hank grabs his metal truckers flashlight and leaps out before
Ortiez can scramble to his feet Ortiezs knife appears out
of nowhere but Hank catches him with a kick to the gut that
puts him back down Still reeling Ortiez lunges but Hank
catches him square in the jaw with the flashlight Ortiez
hits the pavement and Hank pummels him viciously

HANK
Fucking wetbacks its always knives
isnt it You enjoy cutting him up
Did you

Sanders arrives and tries to pull him off Reacting
instinctively Hank elbows her in the face breaking her
nose and sending her sprawling He doesnt even glance back
he just keeps releasing his fury on Ortiezs bloody face
Nunez arrives a heartbeat later aiming his weapon

DETECTIVE NUNEZ
Let him go Stop

But he doesnt Nugent runs up and pulls Hank off rolling
him to the ground Hank struggles with Nugent trying to get
back at Ortiez

DETECTIVE NUGENT
Hey HEY What the hell are you
doing

Hank comes to his senses and stops struggling Sanders
struggles to her feet holding her spurting nose

INT POLICE STATION - HOLDING AREA -- EVENING

Hank opens his eyes He sits cuffed to a wooden bench He
looks down at his hands cut and swollen

He glances through the open door and sees Ortiez being
released from a holding cell into the custody of two burly
MPs They head for the exit meaning theyre going to have
to pass Hank Hank tugs on the chain that binds him as they
near

HANK
What was it You wanted him to carry
drugs for you and he wouldnt do it
You afraid he was going to tell on
you That it Chico

That did it Ortiez jerks to a stop face to face with Hank
leans in close to his ear and whispers

( )

ORTIEZ
Wouldnt it be funny if the devil
looked just like you

The MPs get him moving again Hank calls after him

HANK
Come back here you wetback prick
Ill show you what the devil looks
like

ORTIEZ
(laughs him off)
Fuck you man

Ortiez disappears around the corner with his guards He
turns and sees Sanders approaching her nose swollen a band-
aid over the cut

HANK
I see you cracked him wide open

SANDERS
Hold out your hands

HANK
I didnt mean to hit you

SANDERS
That what passes for an apology in
your world

HANK
Im sorry

SANDERS

HANK

from a home that lies at the eye of the storm

As she walks toward it she notices a muscular man in his

PENNING
So he wasnt lying

Penning has to laugh Hank smiles for the first time in
many days Then his thoughts drift back to his dead son

PENNING

And then a thought strikes Hank and he looks at Penning
It is clear from his expression that Hank now knows something
we dont something terrible

Hank downloads a video and plays it Black punctuated by the
occasional flash of an image the audio comes in and out
Someone is whimpering pleading in Arabic We see a flash

of his face a bound IRAQI PRISONER with a bag over his head
lying on the floor of the moving High Back Humvee between

the feet of the men in Mikes squad Mike is just off screen

But she cant seem to stand She looks around the room
then at her brimming out basket Something makes her
reconsider a document in there She slides out the credit
card statement and flips through it wondering what bothered
her about it

She stops at the chicken receipt and then looks back at the
tube sock and other receipts -- the signature for the chicken
is different than the others

starts needling him Saying shit

SANDERS
Like what

PENNING
I dont know like what a good driver
Mike is stuff that makes no sense
Bonner has enough and pulls over and
they go at each other again Long
is yelling for them to cut it out so
we can go home and Mike starts cursing
him too and I look down and Im
stabbing him

SANDERS
You are

She throws a look to Kirklander who cant hold her glance

PENNING
Yeah I mean he always had to push
things too far you know Whats
making me madder is that he is just
standing there not fighting back
like some sort of weird macho thing

SANDERS

Your friends didnt try and stop
you

( )

PENNING

I think they were sort of stunned
Theyre yelling And then Mike falls
down And hes dead And Long says
Christ what do we do now It was
Bonners idea to chop him up He
used to work in a butcher shop knew
how to work the knife around the
joints made it easier

(beat )
We were going to bury the parts but
it was getting late And we hadnt
eaten

SANDERS
You were hungry

PENNING
Starving So we stopped at the
chicken shack

Sanders tries not to react

PENNING (CONTD)

You ask me why I dont know I
liked Mike we all did

(beat )
But on another night That could
have been Mike with the knife and me
in the field I think Mike was the
smart one I think he could see

Penning starts to be overcome by his emotions To Hank

PENNING (CONTD)
I am truly sorry sir Im sorry
for your loss

Hank fights the urge to leap across the table and strangle

him

HANK
I saw a video Mike shot him in the
back of a Humvee It looked like he
was torturing a prisoner

PENNING
(has to smile)
We arrested some hajji hes wounded
Were riding along and Mike pretends
hes a medic sticks his hand in the
guys wound asks Does that hurt
(MORE )

( )

PENNING (CONTD)

to cope We all did stupid things

EXT FT RUDD - PARKING LOT -- DAY
Hank opens his drivers door and throws the duffel in before
him slides in and starts the engine before he closes the
truck door He stares out through the windshield and sees

BAGHDAD STREET - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF A MOVING HUMVEE

A kid runs into the middle of the street between vehicles
picks up a soccer ball and turns to look toward the camera

INSIDE THE MOVING HIGH BACK HUMVEE

Mike panics Bonner urges him to speed up Mike steps on the
accelerator

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The Humvee hits the boy with the ball The only sound we
hear is the thud and then the body tumbling under the
vehicles undercarriage

INSIDE THE HIGH BACK HUMVEE

Mike drives on a moment betraying no emotion Then brakes

ANGLE ON THE STREET

Mike steps out and walks back toward the small body that
lies on the side of the road Bonner gets out and yells at
him Mike stops He sees people running toward the body
from a nearby house

Ortiez parts the tarp and peers out from the back

Mike lifts his phone composes the shot and takes a picture
of the body

Mike turns and walks back Bonner hesitates obviously
unnerved by the sight of the body They return to the
vehicle step in and tugs closed the door
BACK WITH HANK
The images are too much to bear He pulls his door closed
