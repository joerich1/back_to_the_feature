OVER BLACK

An anguished wind HOWLS Its lonely ballad building in pitch
Whipping against --

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

A dark ocean of evergreens that extends far beyond our field
of vision Its thicket impenetrable its interwoven foliage
harboring hidden secrets

We DRIFT down from its verdant heights to

A rural HIGHWAY that ventures deep into its darkness

The road bordered by an open GATE Unmarked and
inconspicuous Its metal frame RATTLING in the wind

An ominous introduction to the place beyond its gape

The wind’s tortured wails escalating in pace and ferocity
PRE-LAPPING the roar of its artificial counterpart

INT BREAK ROOM K-MART - NIGHT

A large industrial AIR CONDITIONER

DRONING against streaks of tissue paper attached to its
grills

Creating an eerily frigid environment for an employees’
lounge in disarray

Grease-laden plates adorn its tables Unwashed coffee mugs
litter its counters A miserable vending machine rests
against its fraying wall

This is the dismal mundane behind the scenes of the American
box store

INT THE SHOPPING GROUNDS K-MART - NIGHT

A mundane we experience in full as we navigate aisle after
aisle of its dreary interior --

The over-stuffed shelves that extend far beyond the reach of
consumers

The monster shopping carts that counter notions of “less is
more”
The flickering LED’s that cast everything edible ina
nauseating light

And that one overweight shopper that puts on a down jacket in
preparation for spending ten minutes in the frozen section

For some this is heaven For others purgatory

As we PUSH towards the --

CHECKOUT LINE

Where we greet our nametagged heroine --

AVA MOORE 26 and dejected Sporting her red K-Mart apron
like an affliction Tired eyes worn from the monotony of her
small town life

The same eyes that now look past the empty interior around
her Past the vibrant price tags that boast of “never before
seen” deals seen every week

And towards an industrial-sized CLOCK that hangs from the
store’s upper echelons Its second-hand painfully ticking
past ten

Her steady gaze burdened by the boredom of the graveyard
shift

EXT PARKING LOT K-MART - LATER

Empty Dark

Its orange lamps flickering Shopping carts dispersed without
any direction

An exasperated Ava navigates the fray to her beat up Toyota
Camry Parked alone at the far corner of the lot

Walking alone towards it

Eager fingers fumble with the car keys as she unlocks the
vehicle

Ripping off her apron in haste Tossing it to the passenger
seat before --
INT AVA’S CAMRY PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Sitting down behind the wheel
She stops for a second Breathing deeply Eyes glazing over
Staring off into the empty space before her The numbing
dullness of her day having taken its toll

She lets out an exasperated SIGH before she inserts her key
into the ignition

And starts her sputtering engine The radio coming alive with
something electronic and moody like FKA Twigs
INT AVA’S CAMRY RURAL HIGHWAY - LATER

She navigates the dark road before her HEADLIGHTS peering
into the night

MUSIC blaring Quiet fingers drumming on the wheel to its
ambient chorus

Unconscious of the harrowed wilderness around her
While her vehicle approaches a lone STOPLIGHT
Its red bulb flickering above

An abandoned Texeco station dwells on her left Depressed and
dreary

Not a single car in sight

She comes to a gradual stop flicking her blinker to the
right Its CLICK CLICK CLICK joining her radio’s undulating
mood

Before turning down an even darker country road

Devoid of all street lights The blackness before us baleful
and foreboding

As she ventures deeper into its aura

Eyes escaping through her windshield

Into its abyss

Merely a few feet illuminated before her at a time
Two white hashmarks

Disappearing and reappearing with each passing second
PULLING us back --

Into the front seat with Ava
Engrossed in the ambience of her music
As we now DRIFT past her

Past the clutch

And into the back seat

Where we join a HOODED FIGURE

Riding along without her knowledge Facial characteristics
obscured in the night

Clutching a SYRINGE in his fist

That he suddenly JERKS forward-- and PLUNGES into her neck
Her blackout instantaneous

The car LOSING CONTROL--

AS WE SMASH TO
BLACK

Over the sound of her vehicle LURCHING to the left VEERING
off the road and SLAMMING into a tree

As we unveil our haunting title

PARIVINS CAME

Prompting a FADE into
TWO EYES

Lids closed

Lashes rustling
Easing awake

Slowly parting to view what appears to be an --
INT BEDROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

The clarity of our PERSPECTIVE improves as the familiar voice
of Carole King beckons our return to reality

Where we find ourselves staring at a new pair of EYES

A DEER’S

But there’s something bizarre about them Something lifeless
As we PULL back to the rest of its figure

Taking in its stillness Its matted fur Its severed head--

And the PLAQUE that rests behind it

Our fears momentarily subside as we realize the nature of its
existence -- a taxidermy trophy

But now that we have a full purview we notice that it’s
surrounded by similar relics other woodland creatures that
have been killed gutted and stuffed for decoration

In fact the whole room is overburdened by them

As a now fully conscious AVA comes to in a bedroom
reminiscent of a most idyllic hunting lodge

Wood paneling Nostalgic amenities Taxidermy galore
A stone bathroom on her left
Quilted blankets before her

Carole King’s “It’s Too Late” rising from an antiquated alarm
clock on her bedside table

All of this unfamiliarity triggering panicked questions of
“where am I “How did I get here”

While the room’s pine door opens for

MRS PALFREY Late 60’searly 70s Radiant with two sides of
cheerful A temperament that ranges from nice to too nice

Entering with fresh towels and a welcoming smile

MRS PALFREY
Rise and shine Sleeping Beauty

She sets the towels on the bedside table Turning off Carole
MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
How’d you sleep

Her eyes gauge Ava’s startled confusion the crippling
anxiety of waking up somewhere unknown

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
(slow and reassuring)
Don’t you worry hun- I know my
face and this place- they ain’t
familiar But trust me you’re in
good hands here

She carefully reaches out to our heroine’s arm who recoils
at her touch

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
(kind)
Sweetheart I’m not tryna hurt you
I just need to adjust your IV

Sure enough Ava notices the needle sticking into her arm
Its clear tubing leading up to an improvised IV resting on
the bed’s headboard

Driving Ava’s mind towards darker answers to her earlier
questions Struggling to sift through her uncooperative
memory for clues figments anything

As she allows her visitor to gently remove its tip from her
vein while the old woman explains

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
I know how this all looks But it
ain’t bad hun It ain’t bad at
all We took good care of you
Sure head might feel a little
jumbled Memory hazy Stitches a
bit sore But John used to run the
oncology wing at Mass General And
he knows what’s he’s doing

At the mere mention of the word “stitches” Ava’s attention
drifts down to her body

Roughly pulling back the covers to reveal

A grisly web of BLACK STITCHES Running across a GASH on her
inner thigh

The sight taking her breath away Confirming that something
terrible--
AVA
(trembling)
What the hell happened to me

Her visitor smiles running a reassuring hand through Ava’s
hair

MRS PALFREY
Nothing too serious hun You was
just in an accident

AVA
(breathless)
An accident

MRS PALFREY
Nasty little wreck But you’re
okay And youre alive

AVA
(processing)
So you found me all crashed up
and all and brought me here

MRS PALFREY
Sure thing hun Patched you right
up too Funny thing ‘bout living
off that beaten path though- when
that path beats you ain’t no
hospital to go runnin’ to that’s
for sure

She pauses wrapping the used IV in one of her towels

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
But don’t worry There ain’t no
debts to be paid- no lives owed or
nothin’ We’re all about
hospitality here Stay as long as
you want as long as you need

Ava smiles politely panicked thoughts still circulating

AVA
Where exactly is here

MRS PALFREY
(smiles )
You’re at the Lodge hun

AVA
I’m sorry
MRS PALFREY
The Lodge- a sunny little BandB my
husband and I have ran together
since we retired Unfortunately we
don’t get many guests up here- nor
do we have many that stay that
long so we’re more than delighted
to have you with us as long as you
need Ava

Ava stops at the sound of her name Heart dropping for a

second

AVA
How- how do you know my name

But her host just smiles --

And gestures to Ava’s wallet resting on the bedside table

MRS PALFREY
Them three beautiful letters be on
that ID sweetheart Hope you don’t
mind we pulled it straight from
the wreckage

She pauses remembering

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)

Oh and speaking of that wreckage
our local mechanic- that good ol’
Lewis boy down on Old Wind Road- he
has your car We’re friends of the
family so trust us when we say
it’s good people all around

(smiles )
I’m sure he’ll have her fixed up in
no time Maybe even by tomorrow if
youre lucky

AVA
(slow reaction)
Sorry- I’m just like- still
processing This is a lot to take
in-

MRS PALFREY
No no worries at all I know
everything’s still a bit hazy But
if you need anything just holler
for Judy That’s me And if you
can’t get me that way try the bell
at the front desk

(MORE)
MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
But really don’t hesitate to make
yourself feel at home here
alright At the Lodge what’s ours
is yours too

She gathers the towels with a smile and heads towards the
door stopping momentarily at its threshold

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
We’re really glad to have you
‘round here Ava We’ve been hoping
to have a guest like you for a real
long time

And with that she leaves our heroine alone in her new
surroundings

Surroundings Ava can now observe in full Eyes scanning
across her immaculate interior Taking in the taxidermy
animals that eerily stare right back

Weird would be an understatement

She throws the covers off herself her hands reaching to the
bedside table for her wallet

Now slowly getting out of bed Wincing Clearly burdened by
her wound

Gathering her belongings

And making her way out the open door into the --

HALLWAY
Peering curiously at its strange aesthetic

Hollowed cavernous and symmetrical Bred from the darkest
Stephen King nightmare

Identical doors housing identical rooms Their pine frames
numbered ONE through EIGHT in dripping black paint

The severed heads of BUCKS mount the walls Their antlers
sharp and threatening

Hanging glass lanterns illuminate the fray Casting the
forest green wallpaper in a harsh flickering ambiance

At its far end a MIRROR rests above a small dresser A
sacrificial Navajo BLADE decorating its countertop Yes you
read that right a sacrificial Navajo BLADE

Ava ventures deeper into its hall
Pacing down its dark corridor warily

Past the watchful eyes of the bucks The lanterns An air
conditioning vent by the floor

Stopping before the mirror to take a look at herself

A sickly bruise colors her forehead Her eyes weary and
strained from her concussion

But she looks otherwise refreshed Sleep having rejuvenated
her No longer the visibly dejected K-Mart cashier we first
met

She even smiles until her eyes peer down the dark deep
hallway behind her Her smile disappearing at its sight

She looks down at the Navajo blade Curiously bringing her
hands around its hilt Examining its cold steel Weighing it
in her grip

Before setting it back atop the dresser

And heading down the Lodge’s grand staircase --

LOBBY

Its decadent pine steps leading to an entrance
“ostentatious” doesn’t even begin to describe Its alluring
presentation leaving Ava in awe

A stone fireplace of hyperbolic proportions anchors the room
Bordered by a concierge’s desk of dark oak A golden bell
holds court atop its polished surface

Decorative veneers crawl up wooden walls adorned with
paintings of nature’s most serene moments Antique firearms
and fraying snow shoes join their ranks

Panoramic windows look out at the great outdoors beyond their
panes Shafts of SUNLIGHT seeping through --

Showcasing the room’s most indulgent amenity

A triumphant full-sized LION perched atop a decorative cliff
of black rock Jaws open Teeth extended Mane groomed

The most prized collection of a hunter A proud taxidermy
boast purposefully positioned in the lobby for all to see

As Ava reaches the stairwell’s final step her eyes scan
across the captivating interior

Until they settle on two gargantuan wooden DOORS at the
front of the Lodge

She pushes them aside as she steps out onto the --

EXT FRONT PORCH THE LODGE - AFTERNOON

A large oak awning shades a company of wooden deck chairs
All overlooking an unkept meadow that bleeds into the front
lines of an evergreen forest

A breath-taking sight that Ava takes in full

WOMAN’S VOICE
Beautiful ain’t it

Ava turns to the source of the voice

A WOMAN lounging on a deck chair to Ava’s right Sunglasses
on Eyes craned forward at our natural setting

WOMAN
A few hours here and I never want
to leave

Ava nods her agreement
AVA
(hesitant)
It’s really something

The woman smiles taking off her glasses for a closer look at
her guest As we meet for the first time

ATHENA FERREIRA Early 30s A professional demeanor that
rivals the strength drive and intrigue of Cersei Lannister
A presence in a room without uttering a word

ATHENA
You just get in

AVA
Something like that

Athena looks up at her quizzically

AVA (CONTD)
(explaining)
Got in a little fender bender
nearby Guess I spent a while
sleeping it off
ATHENA
(smiles )
Looks like that makes two of us

AVA
You got in a wreck too

ATHENA
Yup and I guess by the makes of
it we probably hit each other

Ava laughs But we know otherwise

AVA
I’m Ava

ATHENA
Athena

They make each other’s acquaintance

ATHENA (CONTD)
You got any idea where we are

Her attention drifts to the triumphant meadow before them

AVA
Can’t say I’ve seen any of this
before

ATHENA

Me neither

AVA
You try geolocating

ATHENA
Haven’t been able to find my phone
since waking up Got yours

Ava feels down into her pockets realizing --

AVA
Nope

ATHENA
Guess that’s supposed to be the
point of a place like this Getting
off the grid

AVA
off the grid with running water
fresh towels and a California King
mattress

Athena cracks a smile

ATHENA
Hey we can all enjoy nature in our
own way
AVA
(smirking)

If you can call that nature

SMASH INTO

INT STERILE HALLWAY UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY
Too bright Too pristine
LEDs hum with electricity Generators roar with tenacity

(NOTE In this unknown location we will never see faces
Just their bodies cut below the head

A housekeeping CART rolls into frame Burdened by cleaning
supplies fresh towels new sheets etc

Pushed by an unknown FIGURE clad in an archaic maid get-up
Its lace freshly ironed Its white bow neatly tied

The sound of a key waging war with its lock PRE-LAPS --

INT HOTEL ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - LATER

Our cart’s arrival in a five-star bedroom Neutral in color
Modern chic in design

Glass and silver amenities Top shelf electronics And
notably no windows

Once inside our MAID goes to work Quickly commencing a
rash frenetic MONTAGE of

Replacing the sheets Making the bed Dusting the counters

Before setting a delectable gift BASKET on the bedside table

Chocolate truffles fresh caviar and fine whiskey among its
ranks A proud “WELCOME” penned on its front

CUT TO
CLOSE UP A threatening WOLF

Teeth bared and menacing Eyes yellow and sinister Deadly
still in its taxidermy state

ATHENA (0S)
The Palfreys said some Lewis boy’11l
have my car back here tomorrow-

INT LOBBY THE LODGE - AFTERNOON

We rejoin Athena and Ava Now inside and heading to the
concierge’s desk

A muffled WHISPER on her right catches Ava’s attention as she
peers across the lobby’s threshold into the LIVING ROOM
where two rugged-looking GUESTS (one African-American one
Asian both men) quietly converse

Feeling her stare they both make sudden eye contact with
her contact she quickly breaks courtesy of

ATHENA
Then I’1l have to bid this place
adieu

AVA

(turns back to her)
Youre headed somewhere

ATHENA

(nods jokingly sarcastic)
Toronto Was actually en route when
I crashed They got like the Super
Bowl of insurance conventions up
there Just instead of half time
Beyoncé it’s the salesman of the
year award And replacing the
fireworks post-game’s got sweaty
drunk married men playing grab ass
with anything under thirty-five
hell of a time if you ask me

Ava chuckles as they reach the concierge’s desk Athena
inching towards its golden bell

ATHENA (CONTD)
Just need to call the boss and let
him know of the hold up

She presses it Its RING shrill and high-pitched

The two wait there patiently the bell surprisingly having
inspired no new movements No rapidly approaching Palfreys

ATHENA (CONTD)

Weird You’d think those two would
jump the gun the second they felt
needed

She tries again this time after a moment’s wait ushering
in a frazzled Mrs Palfrey who emerges from the MANAGERS
OFFICE directly behind the desk

MRS PALFREY
(catching her breath)
I’m so sorry hun We’re a bit
tangled up at the moment What can
I get ya

ATHENA
Just looking to use the phone real
quick Can’t seem to find mine and
kinda want the boss to know where
I’m at

Her host shakes her head

MRS PALFREY
I’m sorry Miss Ferreira But
that’s just not possible

ATHENA
(confused)
Come again

MRS PALFREY
It seems that we’ve been having
trouble with the phone lines today
Bastards just don’t want to
cooperate

ATHENA
How about the Internet- you guys
got Wi-Fi E-mail Anything

Judy shakes her head again this time regretfully

MRS PALFREY
John and I are a bit on the old-
fashioned side of things
She pauses before suggesting
MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
Try checking with us tomorrow
Maybe that phone’1l be doing
exactly what it’s supposed to by
then
Athena smiles cordially but is clearly peeved

ATHENA
Thanks Judy Youve been a great
help

While they exchange more pleasantries Ava’s attention slowly
drifts away from them instead escaping upwards to the

STAIRWELL

Where she notices a Native American TEEN quietly descending
Anonymous and mysterious Clad in a white fraying blouse
that has never seen the inside of a Whirpool washing machine

The two making long eerie eye contact as we --

SMASH TO

INT STERILE HALLWAY UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY
MOVEMENT

FIVE confident bodies powering forward our FOCUS crispening
to find --

Ten Hugo Boss DRESS SHOES CLACKING on the cold floor their
assertive steps echoing in our cavernous interior

Dress shirts ironed slacks leather briefcases carbon
copies of the models who grace the catalogues of Emporio
Armani

The posse veers left down a carpeted hallway its grey sleek
surface absorbing their expensive footsteps

Each pair branches off individually bee-lining to their
rooms

As we follow one in particular -- black laced and polished

Reaching their door Key enters lock prompting its frame to
part revealing --

HOTEL ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - CONTINUOUS

The maid’s dedicated work having rendered the chic interior
spotless

Our suit takes in his elegant lodgings Specifically the gift
basket that awaits him

He peels back its plastic wrapping to get to the whiskey and
the roller glass that accompanies it

Pours himself a generous finger
Downs it
And sets his briefcase on the carefully made bed

ATHENA (0S)
Tell me you’ve had time to explore
this place

CUT TO

INT DARK HALLWAY THE LODGE - AFTERNOON

Dark wood Hazy lighting Black and white hunting portraits
bordered by the taxidermy heads of more defeated prey

All welcoming Athena as she branches off from the lobby
leading a curious Ava into the fray

AVA
Nah I told you- just got up

ATHENA
Damn you’ve been missing out then

She turns towards Ava jokingly miming the macabre
fascination of a haunted house tour guide

ATHENA (CONTD)
Place may be gorgeous on the
outside but it’s the inside that’s
something else It’s massive- like
way bigger than it looks
Definitely giving off some low-key
creepy vibes The stuffed animal
carcasses all over

(MORE)

ATHENA (CONTD)
Makes the whole place feel like a
Republican version of the Shining

She leads Ava past the closed doors of unknown rooms Past
another line of taxidermy victims as they venture deeper down
the hall’s length

ATHENA (CONTD)

(joking)
The Palfreys may be nice but
living in a house full of posed
dead animals Certifiable psychos
mark my words

Athena chuckles opening the door at its end its frame
CREAKING to reveal the --

INT DINING ROOM THE LODGE - CONTINUOUS

Dark intricate paneling Low-lighting Mounted birds of prey
surrounding an exquisite dining table No other
entrancesexits visible

Athena quickly plops down at its head while a curious Ava
peruses the new strange room

AVA
What about the other guests

ATHENA
What about them

AVA
I mean- are there other guests I
saw a girl on the stairs And two
dudes in the living room

ATHENA
There’s a handful Five or six
maybe Real quiet bunch from what
I’ve seen

Ava pauses eyes engrossed in the looming form of a taxidermy
hawk astuffed mouse helplessly trapped in its talons

AVA
Have you tried talking to them

ATHENA
Yeah I tried But everyone seems
to want to keep to themselves
(beat then)
(MORE )

ATHENA (CONTD)
Then again I’m pretty loud and

forward

AVA
Isn’t that what most people call
friendly

ATHENA
off-putting is another popular
choice

AVA
Trust me there are definitely way
more--

WHAM The WALL in front of Ava SUDDENLY SLIDES OPEN-- AN
UNKNOWN MAN EMERGING--

AND CRASHES into her--

The TRAY of WINE GLASSES he carries SPILLING down her blouse
Its GLASS SHATTERING on the floor a CARVING KNIFE CLATTERING
down with it

The action so sudden even Athena takes a moment to recover

MAN
Oh my god I’m so sorry

He reaches forward to assist her

Upon further inspection the man is nowhere near as
terrifying as his entry just old

Blessed with astute eyes and a dignified face Both now
craning down at Ava’s wine-drenched front

AVA
(shaken)
It’s totally fine

MAN
No it’s not Here let me help you
with that

He starts to wipe her down with the tray’s white napkin It’s
weirdly intimate so she stops him

AVA
Really it’s okay

MAN
I just don’t want it to stain

He makes one last ditch effort before giving up

MAN (CONT’D)
Guess I should probably introduce
myself after getting you all wet

He extends a hand

MR PALFREY
John Palfrey Serial glass breaker

She smiles

AVA
Ava Just Ava

They shake

ATHENA
(confused)
Where the hell did you even come
from

MR PALFREY
Kitchen actually This here’s just
a little passageway a short cut of
sorts House’s is full of ‘em Kind
of like a labyrinth when you see
the whole thing drawn out

Avas eyes drift to the large carving knife on the floor
which he notices

MR PALFREY (CONTD)

(re blade)
That knife’s really something huh
Got that bad boy right there
hunting panthers in the jungles
outside Calcutta Real tough
bastards Quick on the jump and
quick to the jugular

AVA
(hesitant)
Yeah it’s something alright
Could’ve cut through my hand if we
bumped a little differently

MR PALFREY
Youd be surprised what it can cut
through
(an uneasy beat then)
It’s perfect for venison Which we
actually got for y’all tonight
(MORE )

MR PALFREY (CONTD)
Judys knock-out recipe A most
tender rack Definitely worth
looking forward to-

His excitement is beyond apparent

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
Anyway now that I have you both
captive I wanted to extend a warm
welcome to you Although- a little
wine shower and a close call with a
carving knife is as warm a
welcoming as you can possibly hope
for ‘round here

AVA
(smiling politely)

Sounds like it

MR PALFREY
Again my apologies for the spill
I suggest you go get cleaned up
before dinner comes around We eat
early here

He bends over and starts to gather the broken glass with his
hands

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
Early

But as we and Ava watch him we start to notice the growing
presence of BLOOD the shards cutting his skin

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
-and often

Yet he continues unperturbed

OFF Ava and Athena sharing an uneasy look while the sound of
RUNNING WATER rushes us into

INT SHOWER AVA’S ROOM - LATER

Ava steps gingerly inside

Running her hair under its spout Eyes closed Letting its
water cascade down her body

Its almost peaceful

Her calm state of mind unfortunately

Interrupted--

When her eyes catch something peculiar in the shower’s grout
work

With the dining room’s passageway still on her mind she
can’t help but think that its side wall looks like

The outline to a door
No way she thinks as she shrugs off her fears as paranoia

But while she reaches for the shampoo we catch a glimpse of
something else that startles us

A black SPECK high up in its tiling

Barely noticeable but large enough to demand our attention

An attention that grows suspicious after we witness the SPECK
dilate a clear ZOOM that undoubtedly belongs to

A CAMERA LENS

Giving us the distinct feeling that she’s being watched as
we hear --

INT BATHROOM HOTEL ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY
Our UNKNOWN SUIT inhale a perfect line of cocaine Breathing
deeply Letting the drug enter his bloodstream with full
force

Satisfied he turns on his shower to full hot

We watch his muscular back endure a perfect set of push-ups
Until he enters the shower’s steamed interior Letting the
scalding water dribble down his chiseled frame

INT BEDROOM AVA’S ROOM - LATER

Towel wrapped around her body Ava frowns at the wine-stained
clothes lying on her bed Peering curiously around her room
for other options

Eying a wooden dresser on the room’s right

Approaches

Rifles through its drawers Finding an unflattering flannel
and jeans

She stares at them shrugging her shoulders Itll do

INT BEDROOM HOTEL ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY
Picking up a sterling silver razor the UNKNOWN FIGURE shaves
above us His hands steady even after a single drop of blood
dribbles down the white walls of our porcelain sink

Upon drying off he climbs into a neatly-pressed undershirt
His suit process continues with pleated black slacks A form-
fitting black shirt A sleek Armani jacket And a thin

black tie expertly wound into a Windsor

The Hugo Boss shoes return Joined now by a unique pair of
dress socks -- shark-covered to be exact

He slips on a silver Rolex Adjusts his cuff-links
Walks through a cloud of cologne

And is now officially ready for whatever the night brings

INT BATHROOM AVA’S ROOM - LATER

Now dressed Ava finishes drying her hair eyes peering into
the mirror at her reflection when she hears --

The sound of a BELL Loud and pronounced
Coming from outside her room

Curious she prods forward Opening her door to the --

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Where she stops dead

Staring at a peculiar exodus of GUESTS

The others that Athena spoke of including both men and the
Native American teen All walking quietly down the hall as if

stuck in some anti-social trance

Her mind races with a flurry of alarming questions that can
be best summarized as what the fucking fuck

She watches the procession that seems completely oblivious to
her presence

Until she notices Athena among them

Who thankfully turns to our hero and smiles

ATHENA
You coming

AVA
(confused)
Coming where

ATHENA
To dinner apparently

AVA
Is that what this is

ATHENA
Yeah some kind of dinner bell

AVA
Makes so much more sense I thought-

But she stops herself Never mind what she thought Instead
AVA (CONTD)
Yeah hold on a sec I’1l1 be right
down

She darts back to her room to gather her belongings as we --

DRIFT TO

INT DINING ROOM THE LODGE - LATER

Our CAMERA becomes mobile as it navigates the room’s now
transformed interior Darker and more macabre in the early
evening

A candle-lit chandelier casts eerie shadows against the birds
of prey that mount its walls Flickering in and out of
darkness

Illuminating a dining table now lined with old-fashioned
serving plates Silver utensils draped on lace napkins
Decorative amenities basking under its ambient glow

The Palfreys lounge at its head Looking over their guests
with decorum As we visually meet the others

IZABELLA 20’s Indian elite and alluring An urban
sophisticate of the highest breed

JAX Late 20’s British cold and rebellious Your run of
the mill punk rock burnout

MARTINA 17 Hispanic mellow and beat Years of
homelessness having taken their spiritual toll

Our two men --

BRAYDEN 30’s Asian brooding and mysterious A sleeve of
menacing tattoos mirroring his hardened demeanor

CARTER 40’s African-American stoic and haunted A war
veteran that fits the part

Both sit across from Ava and Athena The latter positioned
next to our Native American TEEN as well --

MIKAYLA 19 Quiet observant and reactive An edge to her
that lives beneath the surface

As Mr Palfrey stands before his congregation Wine glass in
hand Clearing his throat His sensual gaze catching his
wife’s knowing eyes

MR PALFREY
Thank you for joining us tonight
It’s wonderful to have eight new
souls to share this intimate
evening with

He gestures to his guests while he talks

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
You know- back when we first
started the Lodge we did it for
the people- the thrill of welcoming
each new group of guests that
passed through our gates Sure
youre unrelated Many of you live
very different lives Come from
different sectors different
cities different backgrounds But
tonight you all have one thing in
common Your paths have all crossed
here sitting at our table with
us

His eyes almost twinkle

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
Each meal Judy are I are blessed to
share with you is an opportunity to
bask in the warmth of new people
So join my wife and I in a toast
for the eight new bodies that grace
us with their presence tonight

(MORE )

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
You are the reason we pursued this
venture and the reason we continue
to do it each and every day
He raises his glass

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
And for that we thank you

EVERYONE
(in unison)
Cheers
They all take a polite drink

He now looks across the table to his wife

MR PALFREY
Judy will you do the honors

Her eyes intimately lock with her husband’s as she nods

MRS PALFREY
Course

Her fingers reach for a single platter at the table’s center
Gripping its silver handle carefully

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)

Now be warned The smell takes a

little getting used to
Mr Palfrey chuckles as Ava’s eyes drift warily to the dish
Suddenly becoming suspicious of what lurks beneath its
serving cover
The very cover that Mrs Palfrey now holds in her hands
Our hero watches attentively
As her host ever so slowly

REMOVES its top--

Revealing a beautiful venison roast Nothing more

Mrs Palfrey takes a deep inhale of its aroma as Ava’s breath
returns

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
There’s just something about
rosemary that always makes for the
sweetest smelling marinades

She smiles as she PLUNGES a huge carving knife into its meat

MRS PALFREY (CONTD)
Now who prefers rare

A Bach SONATA drives our escape into --

INT RECEPTION ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Its mellow chords rise from an antiquated gramophone setting
the pace for a formal gathering best described as opulent

Champagne flutes flow in a wood-paneled space decorated with
a tasteful spectrum of art history

Silver trays boast a delectable array of hors d’oeuvres The
waiting STAFF that carries them tux-clad

Our group of five loiters near a Neoclassical bust Three of
them sip Old-Fashioneds The fourth a Manhattan The fifth
straight scotch

Their body movements are animated Laughing at an unheard
joke Enjoying their upscale party

ATHENA (0S)
I have to ask- what’s with the
taxidermy

CUT TO

INT DINING ROOM THE LODGE - LATER

The forks and knives stop clattering against china plates
Athena’s question breaking a conversational lull

Mr Palfrey chuckles in response

MR PALFREY
Do you find them unsettling Miss
Ferreira

ATHENA
It’s just- there’s a lot

He smiles

MR PALFREY
Guess the obvious answer would
be Judy and I well we love to
hunt

His eyes gauge his audience’s reaction

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
How long have we been at it hun

MRS PALFREY
God Id have to say forty or fifty
years

MR PALFREY
Forty or fifty years of playing
predator and prey Everything weve
ever shot everything we’ve ever
stuffed we have here with us

ATHENA
You stuff them personally

MRS PALFREY
Very much so John is quite the
taxidermist

MR PALFREY
What can I say I have a surgeon’s
hands

His comment inspires uneasy laughter

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
Truth be told weve traveled far
and wide for our collection even
before we started this place
Always game for a new species we
haven’t tracked before A new
member to join our ark

He pauses letting his words marinate

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
You know- it’s always hard for me
to describe it to someone that
don’t see it like I do but for
me there’s something about the
hunt that’s just so fulfilling
Each and every one of us no matter
what species what gender what
build- we all react so differently
when forced into life’s most basic
interaction- to kill or be killed
For it’s only in that life or death
situation that you can learn
something so basic so human about
yourself

(MORE)

MR PALFREY (CONTD)
About the animal inside of you
About your place in nature’s
violent hierarchy

His loving eyes look up at his wife
MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
Id have to say some of our best
memories together are from out on
that carnal trail

He pauses silently recollecting with a smile

MR PALFREY (CONTD)
So our dream once we retired
beyond meeting new wonderful people
like yourselves was to find a home
for all our conquests- some kind of
physical monument for everything
we’ve been through together

There’s something about their eye contact that’s almost
touching

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)

And that I can proudly say is
something we’ve achieved

Mrs Palfrey returns his smile
MRS PALFREY
Something we’re so proud to share

with you

The guests purr The Palfrey’s sentimentality almost heart-
warming as we --

DRIFT TO

INT RECEPTION ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY

We rejoin the party amidst a toast Its words drowned out by
the pleasant notes of Bach The heads of all its listeners
still cut off by our frame

Our group of five takes a cordial sip at its conclusion
before resuming their unheard conversation

After another round of laughter one of them catches a
passing waiter

They have an unheard exchange before our suit hands him his
Blackberry

He gathers the group together for a quick photo A snapshot
that preserves the moment for eternity

A moment that quickly passes into the next as conversation
picks up where it left off

CUT TO
CLOSE UP A ferocious BEAR

Towering in stature Claws elevated and extended Dark eyes
blending in with the flickering darkness of our interior

as long as you want-

INT LOBBY THE LODGE - NIGHT

Clutching hearty glasses of wine the dining party ventures
through our ostentatious entrance

Laughing Joking Comparably more amicable after enjoying a
meal together

MR PALFREY (0S)
-but Judy and I well-

All heading into the --

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A room that breathes of comfort A vintage fireplace Plaid
couches The softest animal furs draped on its floor A
record player hums with yet again Carole King’s “It’s Too
Late”

In 1971 this would’ve been the spot And even today it’s
quite welcoming in a nostalgic sort of way

While each of the guests find a cozy place to sit Mr
Palfrey continues to address them while standing with his
wife at its threshold

MR PALFREY
-we’re part of that “early to bed
early to rise” camp So
regretfully we’re gonna have to
call it an night

He looks out at the eight a friendly smile on his face

MR PALFREY (CONTD)
But the fire’s going the wine’s
flowing and the music’s nice So
don’t let our absence stop you from
having a hell of an evening

He pauses genuinely

MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
It’s probably the last night you’ll
spend together Might as well make
it a great one

And with that he and his wife disappear from the living
room into the LOBBY and up the STAIRS his smile turning
all the more unsettling with each step he takes

The two of them leaving behind a silent now awkward
environment

Eyes scanning the room avoiding contact An ice settling
that a slightly buzzed Athena yet again has to break --

ATHENA
Ever thought it possible for
someone to be too nice

People chuckle slowly getting comfortable again

ATHENA (CONTD)
Like I totally get the first
impression “I gotta be nice so they
don’t think I’m an asshole” thing
But after a while it just feels a
little aggressive

She pauses

ATHENA (CONTD)
But hey- can’t complain Good food
bottomless wine free lodging- I’1l
take it

She eyes the smirking circle around her
ATHENA (CONTD)
Just curious are any of you

actually paying guests

To her and Ava’s surprise everyone slowly shakes their head
no
IZABELLA
Even offered but as soon as I got
out the Amex they told me to put
it away

ATHENA
You up here on vacation

IZABELLA
No course not
(chuckles)
Car broke down

ATHENA
(thoughts churning)
Weird

Her eyes curiously pan to the other six guests

ATHENA (CONTD)
And the rest of you Same kind
of deal

BRAYDEN
(abrupt)
Yeah- car wreck

ATHENA
(gestures to Ava)
Us too recent
He nods
ATHENA (CONTD)
(to Martina)
How ‘bout you
Martina awkwardly stares at her feet
MARTINA
(mutters )
Picked me up begging
Mikayla speaks up

MIKAYLA
Got me hitchhiking

Carter concurs
CARTER

(cold)
Veterans’ counseling group

ATHENA
(to Jax)
And what about you Kurt Cobain

Jax smirks smugly

JAX
Them old folks found me in the
woods High as a kite Pupils the
size of Jupiter Apparently
muttering sweet nothing’s about the
Devil walking the Earth again

Silence

ATHENA
(jokes)
Guess they were right when saying
were from all sects of life

A few of them laugh
ATHENA (CONTD)
And sure- maybe I can’t help but
feel that it’s a little bit odd
that we’re all here because the
Palfreys actively sought us out
Her concern now dissipates into a smile
ATHENA (CONTD)
But hey- maybe there are just
genuinely good people left in this
world And maybe too nice is simply
a welcoming change from everything
but So with that in mind-

As we now join

INT STERILE HALLWAY UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY
The five SUITS strutting down the corridor again

An excitable rush to their movements as they near the sleek
metallic doors of an ELEVATOR

ATHENA (0S)
-let’s have our own toast

She raises her wine glass into the air

-and their surprising kindness

in response

ATHENA
May we forever live in their

(in unison)
The Palfreys

As the sound of HEAVY DOORS parting--

INT STERILE HALLWAY UNKNOWN LOCATION - CONTINUOUS
Preludes the elevator opening The five filing inside

The same gloved HAND reaches forward and presses one of two
BUTTONS on its panel --

Sending the elevator upwards towards the only other floor on
its shaft

FADE TO AN
UNEASY BLACK

As we COME TO

LATER

The night darker More mysterious

The space before us having grown increasingly ominous as we --
FLY through the Lodge’s interior

DRIFTING down its harrowed corridors

Past the shadows flickering against its walls

The mounted animal heads
The numbered doors
Arriving at our mirror HOLDING there

Noticing that the Navajo blade that once decorated its wooden
cabinet is now--

MISSING

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM THE LODGE - NIGHT

Embers dance in the fireplace while “It’s Too Late”
continues to emanate from the record player

The room is almost vacant now Only Athena and Ava are left
lounging on its couches twirling glasses of Merlot

ATHENA
(prodding)
So Ava what do you do

AVA
Wow Pulling out the cocktail ice
breakers now

ATHENA
(smirking)
I’m just curious is all Told you
what I do It’s only fair you
return the favor

AVA
Fine
(beat)
Guess I’m kinda between jobs at the
moment

ATHENA
That an honest answer

Ava smiles found out

AVA
Not exactly
ATHENA
There’s no shame I’m a fucking
insurance salesman for Christ’s
sake The scum of the Earth by most
people’s standards

AVA
Can’t be much worse than working at
a box store

ATHENA
Like a Walmart

AVA
Exactly like a Walmart

ATHENA
Could be worse

AVA
Not much trust me

She pauses for a second mulling over her next words
carefully

AVA (CONTD)
You know I think what scares me
a little bit about working there
and all- is that it makes me feel
so stuck already like I’m twenty-
six but I go to work every night
feeling like someone two years from
retirement Dealing with the same
shit every day every hour- knowing
that the best news I can hear all
night is “clean-up on aisle three”
because at least then I actually
get to do something

The strain in her voice is apparent

AVA (CONTD)
Guess I’m kinda just waiting for
something anything to jolt me out
of this coma And it’s not like I
want to wait either- like what I
really want is to do something
about it But I’ve just been lulled
into this state that I just can’t
get out of

Athena nods understanding that feeling all too well

ATHENA
Then maybe being stranded here
is just the jolt you need to change
things up Let the real you take
the wheel again

AVA
(smiles )
Thatd be nice
They chuckle warmly enjoying another sip of wine in the
otherwise content silence Perfectly relaxed as the somber
lyrics of “It’s Too Late” pick up in pitch driving us into

INT MASTER BEDROOM THE LODGE - NIGHT

Quaint Wood-furnished Framed photos of the Palfrey’s
resting on bedside tables

An empty master bed comes into view Its sheets neatly tucked
beneath its comforter Its pillows undisturbed

INT LOBBY THE LODGE - NIGHT

Too still Too silent

But as we peer through its dark windows

We notice

STEEL WINDOW COVERS cranking down Slowly Covertly Unheard
in the night

As they securely take their place across the frames

Thwarting any light from entering Barricading the glass

INT LIVING ROOM THE LODGE - LATER

Comfortable in a thoughtful silence Athena finishes the last
of her wine before slowly getting up from her coach perch

ATHENA
(gesturing upstairs)
You making moves

AVA
Nah I think I’m gonna stay up a
bit longer Enjoy the ambiance

Athena nods Heading towards the threshold

ATHENA
Want me to leave the record on

AVA
Has it been playing that same song
since we got here

ATHENA
(smirks )
I think so

AVA
Yeah then just leave it

ATHENA
Alright- then I’1l see you
tomorrow

AVA
(smiles )
Sure thing Good night

ATHENA
Night

She slinks out of the room leaving a pensive Ava by herself
Carefully pouring herself another glass from a nearby bottle
while

INT NEW ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Our limited purview reveals a sleek and spotless interior
with a distinct metallic character

Where our five SUITS shake the wrinkled HAND of a SIXTH MAN
The latter making his way around their circle Murmured
pleasantries exchanged between all

NOTE their heads are still beyond our frame

After finishing his round he cordially excuses himself

Heading over to the triumphant silver doors of an ELEVATOR
Extending his finger towards the black SENSOR on their right

The system immediately recognizes his touch A panel below
the sensor slides away revealing the elevator’s controls

He presses “DOWN”

Waits for just a second before its doors part Revealing
another FIGURE inside this one convincingly feminine

Our man walks in joining the waiting party at the back of
the elevator
And as its doors begin to close
We PAN UP for the first time
Revealing the identity of the two inside its car

MR AND MRS PALFREY

Leaving the suits behind in the unknown room as they descend
down to the STERILE HALLWAY below as we--

RETURN TO

INT LIVING ROOM THE LODGE - NIGHT

Ava slowly sips from her wine glass mulling over her
percolating thoughts Miles away from her present A deaf ear
turned to the record player

When--

THE LIGHTS SUDDENLY GO OUT

No rhyme No reason Just darkness
Ava abruptly sits up Mind aghast with “what the hell”

She pans her surrounding cautiously A few dying embers in
the fireplace her only source of illumination

Her eyes slowly become accustomed to her new environment as
she carefully sets her glass down on the wooden coffee table

And ever so cautiously gets up from the couch

Her hesitant steps prodding towards the --

LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Finding it shrouded in utter darkness All light non-
existent All candles expunged

Bizarre
She feels through blackness before her
Stepping into its abyss

Feet locating an unseen stairwell

Fingers gripping the railing
As she inches forward

Step

By excruciating step

Up its circumventing flight

The once ostentatious entry shrouded by an impenetrable
shadow

Her environment invisible
Her surroundings unknown

Burdened by the terrifying reality that anything could be
lurking within its shroud

As she reaches the --

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Its depths blanketed by the pitch black before her
She feels along its walls carefully

Passing over the head of a--

BUCK--

Startling herself as she feels for its snout Running her
fingers through its fur

Before coming into contact with our mirror

She takes a second to stabilize herself against its cabinet
Letting loose a harrowed breath

Before venturing down its dark hallway

Her timid steps

Slinking across the rugged floor

Eyes now getting more and more accustomed
Discerning more and more in the darkness before her
When she catches the sudden sound of FOOTSTEPS

Loud and definitive

Forcing her to stop

Heart thumping Petrified in fright

Anxious ears perking up Cold sweat trickling down her spine
But the sound is unmistakable

Their pace quick And perpetual

Storming towards an unknown destination

Seemingly emanating from

WITHIN THE HALLWAYS WALLS

A trembling Ava carefully gets on her hands and knees
Following the disturbance

Tracing it to the air conditioning VENT just visible on her
right Its metallic guarder slightly above the ground

The FOOTSTEPS ringing louder and clearer here
Echoing beyond its grill

Coming CLOSER

And CLOSER to us

Her eyes peering deeper and deeper inside Her face getting
closer and closer--

UNTIL a DRESS SHOE CROSSES the VENT

RIGHT before our eyes So close we can see its laces Hear
the BREATHING of its owner

Ava stifles an unsettled GASP--
As the shoe now disappears from view
Into the dark unknown beyond our walls

Our heroine deeply confused in the darkness of the hallowed
hallway

Oblivious to a subtle synchronised CLICK from the doors to
rooms ONE through FOUR

Their DEAD BOLTS sliding securely shut

LOCKING their guests inside

SMASH TO

INT ROOM ONE THE LODGE - NIGHT
A still and silent bedroom
The form of Jax just visible beneath the covers

Head draped atop his pillows A tuft of hair blowing back and
forth at the guidance of his steady slumbered breathing

Breathing that’s crudely and immediately VIOLATED

WHEN A BLADE DRIVES THROUGH HIS CHEST

STAINING his sheets with a mid-sleep SLAUGHTER

INT ROOM TWO - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Izabella tosses and turns restlessly Unable to sleep

Frustration slowly building

Her anxious eyes peering at the bedside clock --
1106

Sighs

Stares at the ceiling Pre-dreams circulating--

When she hears something

A slight disturbance

Somewhere within her room

Weird

She sits up Becoming incredibly still No falling asleep
now

Ears perked up seeking confirmation of--
There it is again
Barely audible

But definitely there
Something solid coming into careful contact with the
bathroom’s tile floor

We take Izabella’s POV

As she peers out into the darkness before her
Unable to see anything

But she hears it again The same hesitant sound
Izabella sinks deeper into her covers

There is undeniably something in her room

The sound returns louder now Less careful
Unmistakably a FOOTSTEP

It is not a something in her room But a someone
Izabella pulls tightly on her sheets now

Feeling increasingly vulnerable in bed

Nowhere to go

Nowhere to hide

A new STEP rings out in the darkness Closer now
Her body petrified

Cant move

Can’t scream

The darkness before her overwhelming
Impenetrable

Distinguishing anything impossible

She fearfully closes her eyes now

Robbing us of our PERSPECTIVE

Putting us in an even darker darkness

As another STEP emanates beyond her eyelids Louder and

closer

Followed by another

And another

Sensing a body now Most definitely a body
There it is again

This time the final step

Stopping before us Lurking above

We feel them Hear them breathing

But cant see them

Her body trembles

Her hesitant eyes slowly opening

Looking up at--

DARKNESS

But something is up there

Standing above us

Our eyes grow accustomed to its pitch
Peering out into its abyss

Suddenly recognizing the GLINT of SILVER

And the AX SWINGING DOWN TOWARDS HER--

SKEWERING her in bed A Pollock SPLATTER on white sheets
Her attacker visible for merely a millisecond
The fur-laden MASK of a DEER emerging from the darkness

Before disappearing back into its shroud

INT ROOM THREE - SIMULTANEOUSLY
Dark Silent

A restless Martina stuck in an insomniac’s perpetual staring
contest with the ceiling

She loses Breaking her gaze Brushing aside her comforter

Climbing out of bed en route to the bathroom

Glazed eyes Tired pace
Prodding forward Feet now on tile

Feeling carefully before her Blind hands navigating the
darkened fray

When she stops Sensing something

A presence

On her right By the shower

Invisible to her Yet definitely there

She peers forward Squinting now

Nervous eyes sifting through the dark until they discover
The HEAD of a BEAR

Yes we see it too

Seemingly suspended in mid-air above us Surrounded by a
blanket of darkness

Too still Too silent
Its spatial placement too bizarre for taxidermy decoration
Martina’s mind racing with a hundred “what the fucks”

Taking a careful step backwards Unsure eyes craning up at
the animal before her

MARTINA
(trying)
Hello
There’s no response
No movement

The grizzly’s head as still as can be

Martina’s confusion sets in Compounded with a building sense
of paranoia

Paranoia that finds itself confirmed when--
The bear TILTS its head SIDEWAYS

Its black gaze now locking onto her human form

Predator assessing prey

As the figure takes a firm step forward

Emerging from the darkness in full force--

Black Armani suit Black dress shirt Black Windsor knot

Its MASK tailored from the fur of a previously hunted BEAR
Its fashion choices oddly complementing

The glinting silver AX in its gloved hand

An AX that comes SWINGING at Martina with FULL FEROCITY--
SLICING through the air with the intent to KILL--

An intent stymied by a DIVING Martina-- PLUMMETING to the
bedroom floor--

Quick on her feet now-- PULLING herself up--

SPRINTING towards her bedroom door-- GRABBING at its handle--
Desperate hands FINDING it--

LOCKED

Her eyes fear defeat as the sound of confident FOOTSTEPS
behind her announce her attacker’s casual approach

Dress shoes CLACKING loudly against the tile Her fate
growing all the more dire by the second

So she does the only sensible thing she can do
She lets loose a guttural SCREAM--

BANGING on the bedroom door with desperate fists

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Fists heard on the other side by a startled Ava

Jolting her up from the floor by the air vent Spurring her
SPRINT down the dark passageway

Reaching the door of ROOM THREE The BANGING and SCREAMING
louder Confirming its source

Ava jerks down on its handle

Finding it LOCKED

ROOM THREE - CONTINUOUS

The handle jerking down seen by a crying Martina Giving her
a last drop of hope

MARTINA
(terrified)
Help- help me

As the CLACKING SHOES behind her only get closer

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
A panicking Ava wages war with the handle
But it’s futile

Desperate eyes scan the dark interior for something anything
to pry the door open

Options running thin
Time running out
AVA
(mind racing)
Fuck- fuck- I- I don’t know
ROOM THREE - CONTINUOUS
The CLACKING nearly on top of her now

An adamant Martina unwilling to look back Tears cascading
down her cheeks

MARTINA
(a desperate whisper)
Hurry just- hurry

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ava trying to Fingers still roughly wrestling with the door
handle

But to no avail As we suddenly
Hear it
The blood-curdling sound of an AX--

DRIVING THROUGH FLESH

--AGAIN
--AND AGAIN
-AND AGAIN

Martina’s cries having died down now Suddenly and violently
stopped forever

We hear her defeated body SLIDE down the door frame Blood
audibly smearing against its wood Undeniably the darkest
slip n’ slide in cinematic history

As now all Ava can discern from beyond its frame is the --

HARROWED BREATHING of her masked attacker A murderer that
she never sees

Standing against the door Aware of her presence on the other
side

There’s something almost intimate about it

As he regains his composure Each breath slightly muffled by
his restrictive mask But growing more and more euphoric

Prompting Ava’s blood to run cold

Her wary eyes turning towards the seven other doors in the
hallway Her fear palpable

AS WE SMASH TO

INT ROOM FOUR - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The SCREAMS having jerked awake a sleeping Athena Bolting
upright in bed Startled Alarmed

Staring bewilderingly into the night directly before her
Cold sweat beginning to drip drip drip WHEN--

AN AX COMES SWINGING AT HER HEAD-- an unknown ASSAILANT
EMERGING from the darkness--

Athena DIVES out of its way--

Its VILE EDGE SPEARING through her pillows-- DRIVING a flurry
of FEATHERS airborne-- CRASHING into the wooden bed frame--

ATHENA

quick on the draw ROLLS to the other side of the bed
PROPPING herself up while--

HER ASSAILANT
struggles to DISLODGE his ax from the frame--

As her desperate hands now RIFLE through the bedside
cabinets fingers coming into contact with a small MATCHBOOK--

Now STRIKING the first match--

Its light illuminating

Nothing

Her bed now abandoned Its sheets ruffled

Her pillows nothing but cotton carnage Their feathers still
drifting down Past the ghastly AX WOUND in the bed frame

Definitive proof that the previous horrors occurred
Horrors still very much alive

As she PANS across her interior

Peering into its darkness

The limited light of her match illuminating merely a few feet
in front of her at a time

Its flame burning down to its wooden end as her PAN nears its
close

Its last flicker revealing

A MASKED COUGAR CHARGING RIGHT AT HER--

Black Armani suit Silver glinting ax

EMERGING from her RIGHT-- SWINGING his blade just as her
match GOES OUT

Throwing us into a terrifying DARK UNKNOWN
Hearing the carnal battle without seeing it

AX hits WOOD Bodies struggle A LAMP falls Glass SHATTERS
A match STRIKES--

Returning light to a space in disarray
A dresser HACKED A lamp BROKEN Clothes STREWN everywhere

A trembling Athena clutches the match Eying the Cougar
getting up a few dangerous yards away

Her gaze drifts to the broken lamp on the floor before her
The glass of its light bulb scattered across the rug

Her eyes crane back up at the now approaching Cougar A
desperate idea coming to the surface

As she makes a last-ditch GRAB at the LAMP
RIPPING off its SHADE-- GRIPPING its shaft--

And LUNGING with the SHARP REMAINS of its BULB geared forward
like a weapon--

PLUNGING its SHARDED TIP through the Cougars NECK--

BLOOD SPUTTERS-- SPLURTING-- DRIBBLING down his black suit as
he DROPS his ax-- his defeated body PLUMMETING to the floor
for the final time

An exasperated Athena breathes heavily her match going out
yet again

She strikes another one Thankfully finding the Cougar’s
defeated corpse still there Still dead

She bends over examining his body Checks his pulse to
confirm his fate

Now staring at his head curiously as she elects to ever so
carefully unmask him

Finding

A handsome MAN of elite pedigree Clean shaven but
unfamiliar

What the fuck she thinks as she picks up his ax Using
another match to find a way out of the bedroom

Tries her door first But finds it locked

HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The TWITCH of its handle drawing Ava towards it while--

ROOM FOUR - CONTINUOUS
Athena lights another match Prodding towards the bathroom

Stops before the shower Mouth suddenly agape as we join her
perspective

Its back wall if we can call it that

Is SLID OPEN revealing a secret passageway housed within the
Lodge’s walls

A passageway she now enters Hands firmly gripping the ax
Match leading the way into the darkness

Nowhere else to go but down

JUST AS

HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Desperation brimming Ava’s eyes catch those of a taxidermy
BUCK majestically mounted on the opposite wall An idea
crosses her mind

She approaches the still animal Feeling the sharp thin
points of its antlers

And with one quick jerk of her fist BREAKS one off the
beast

Returning to the door of ROOM FOUR Attention drifting to its
bronze hinges

Positions the antler directly below the top HINGE PIN

And with her fist as a makeshift hammer DRIVES it out The
pin CLATTERING to the dark floor

Now making quick work of its bottom one the door teetering
off its hinges

Falling parting to reveal the interior carnage of --

ROOM FOUR - CONTINUOUS

The bed in disarray Pillows slaughtered Visually
reminiscent of the carnal fight that unfolded here

Our unmasked Cougar’s body disturbingly still Blood still
wet pooling on the decorative rug

A trembling Ava inches forward Venturing into the fray
Terrified eyes craned at the corpse before her

Slinking through the disheveled bedroom Into its bathroom
Finding it

Empty Pristine Its SHOWER WALL closed

She turns her back Oblivious to the reality we know

Her grimace grows Deeply unsure about Athena’s whereabouts
And profoundly rattled by it

SMASH INTO
A frenetic quick MONTAGE
Sharp Biting Unrelenting
The committed ANTLER DRIVING through PIN
AFTER PIN
AFTER PIN
Door after door parting for Ava even the ones unlocked
The bloody remains of Jax in ONE Izabella’s mangled form in
TWO A restless Carter in FIVE A frightened Mikayla in SIX

An unnerved Brayden in SEVEN Her own empty room in EIGHT

Leaving us in the

With our group of four An unsettling confusion sinking in
among them Terror finding new hosts

As rising from its robotic depths

Is a PLATFORM Retrofitted with a

Reaching a MOLD in a metallic ceiling A perfect fit Its

As we now PULL up through this “ceiling”

And into the --

INT HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Finding our trap concealed by an ornamental rug The Lodge’s
sinister undercarriage hidden from view

A considerable distance down the dark corridor our oblivious
four are just where we left them -- terrified and confused

CARTER
I’m sorry I just can’t wrap my
head around-
(swallows hard)
Four bodies a fifth missing and
you say you saw no one come in or
out

AVA
It’s not like it makes much sense
to me either the doors were
locked from the inside

Brayden gestures to the disheveled interior of Room Four
BRAYDEN
And the dead dude in the suit
Never seen him before
AVA
No and I have no idea where he

came from or where Athena went

Carter shakes his head in disbelief

CARTER
So you’re telling me four of us
were locked inside- and slaughtered
like uh penned up animals or
some shit

AVA
I know it’s hard to believe-

CARTER
It’s not that hard when we have
their bodies right there

BRAYDEN
What worries me was that ours were
kept purposefully unlocked

CARTER
Which means they kept us alive

BRAYDEN
But why

Avas eyes harbor her growing fear but she suppresses it

AVA
Look it doesn’t fucking matter
what’s going on or what goddamn

nightmare we just woke up in We
need to get out of here And we
need to do it fast

Everyone nods the sentiment shared Except for Mikayla who
has suddenly stopped body going rigidly still--

MIKAYLA

She holds her hand up to silence the group

The rest of them now come to an abrupt halt

Joining her stillness Staring at her curiously while their

And with the hallway now eerily quiet they all begin to
notice

The subtle return of our FOOTSTEPS

Echoing in our cavernous interior More of them this time
Dark and purposeful CLACKING without remorse

BRAYDEN
(whispering)
What the hell

MIKAYLA
(whispering manic)
It makes no sense there’s no one
out here
AVA

Exactly
They all turn to her as she realizes--

AVA (CONTD)
I think they’re coming from the
walls

Their eyes glance fearfully at the dark barriers between
themselves and whatever lurks within them

The FOOTSTEPS closer now Becoming all-encompassing
Suffocating

MIKAYLA
(whispering)
What the fuck is going on man

AVA
(whispering)
I don’t know
She pauses fearfully
AVA (CONTD)
(whispering)
I really don’t know
As they begin to quickly trek down the hallway unknowingly
approaching the trap hidden beneath its floor
INT SECRET PASSAGEWAY THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Athena ventures deeper and deeper into the fray ax extended
before her Lighting match after match to illuminate her way

Until she reaches the main thoroughfare

A dark concrete tunnel lit by hazy LED’s The power very
much in operation here

Her ears pick up on the same FOOTSTEPS emanating from deep
down the tunnel’s depths

She gulps pocketing the matches And takes a committed step
into its realm
INT HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Our group very much mobile now Racing forward through the
darkness Desperate to escape

The sound of FOOTSTEPS all around them Driving them forward
Setting the frenetic pace of their beating hearts

Brayden leads the pack Survivalist instincts kicking in
Fear and adrenaline powering his movements

We watch his FEET rip across the rug Relentless and
committed

Paced steps blending into the next

Momentum taking the wheel A mere gear away from an all-out
sprint

Feet Rug Feet Rug

Each step covering new ground Coming into contact with new
space

Until they reach what we fear awaits them--
One second a foot is airborne
The next it comes down on the deceptive slab of rug--

The BEAR TRAP SPRINGING UP and DEVOURING his LEG

His body PLUMMETS to the ground A SCREAM of agony ERUPTING
from his LUNGS--

Our group watches in terror as he goes down in front of them
Quickly coming to his assistance Staring at

BLOOD Everywhere

Its metallic teeth have breached his ankle Their clench
breaking through the bone Severed flesh and tendons in their
bite

BRAYDEN
(trembling)
Oh God- oh fuck-

AVA
(uneasy)
Jesus alright just- stay calm
We’ll- well get you out of here
okay man

She seeks Carter’s gaze for confirmation the veteran
crouching down gauging the strength of the trap’s grip on
Brayden’s ankle Feeling for weaknesses in its design

Finding none

Carter stops defeated eyes craned to Ava The FOOTSTEPS
around them growing louder by the second

Closer now Circling their prey Leaving our trio with a
terrible decision to make

Brayden’s fearful eyes glancing down at his horrific wound
The walls around them Realizing the gravity of his fate The
same dire fate he’s imposing on the others

BRAYDEN
(clenched teeth)
Just go
AVA
What No
BRAYDEN

Yes-— just do it

AVA
No we can’t leave you

The FOOTSTEPS grow even more deafening

BRAYDEN
You have to

AVA
We cant

BRAYDEN
(stern decisive)
You fucking have to

He grabs her arm and stares into her eyes His message clear
and unrelenting The FOOTSTEPS nearly on top of them now

MIKAYLA
They’re gonna be here any second

CARTER
It’s either now or never
sweetheart
AVA
(still staring at Brayden)
Okay
(beat)
Okay I’m coming

Eyes never leaving the fallen Brayden she follows the other
two down the hallway heading towards the STAIRS

Leaving Brayden bleeding out onto the rug

Breath slowing Fear growing Withering in pain

Hearing the terrifying FOOTSTEPS get closer and closer
Waiting to die

A wait he only has to endure for a few painful seconds

Before the WALL behind us parts for an unknown FIGURE in an
all-black suit

His dark form blending in with the equally dark hallway

The back of his head covered by the auburn fur of a FOX MASK
His pace confident and calculated

Bearing down on a cowering Brayden

Brandishing our missing Navajo blade

Flanked by the accompanying domineering figures of BEAR and
DEER

CUT TO

INT SECRET PASSAGEWAY THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Athena continues to venture deeper down its path Passing
lanterns BUZZING with electricity

The FOOTSTEPS growing louder and louder Closer and closer to
her
She clutches her ax tighter and tighter
Until she makes out MUFFLED VOICES heading her way

Her eyes grow panicked Scanning her perimeter for somewhere
anywhere to hide

The VOICES getting louder as her pace picks up
Desperation building now

Two FIGURES nearly coming into view--

When she spots a THRESHOLD on the right of the tunnel
Quickly filing through Hiding behind its wall

Eyes geared out at the passageway Praying that they don’t
make the same turn

The VOICES and FOOTSTEPS becoming excruciatingly loud
Any minute now

Deep breath Athena Deep breath

Palms sweaty

Knuckles whitening

Ax trembling

WHEN BEAR AND DEER RACE PAST

Axes glinting Suits black and impeccable
Blowing right past her without sensing her presence
But notably

DRAGGING an unconscious BRAYDEN in their wake

She lets out a horrified breath as they pass Her tension far
from subsiding

Tension that finds itself exacerbated as soon as she turns
around and sees the room within which she chose to hide --

An ARMORY

Weapons of all shapes and sizes From all centuries of
warfare All empires All continents
Hunting knives Crossbows Daggers Medieval torture
instruments Contemporary power tools Blades the word

“sinister” doesn’t even begin to describe

Athena gulps taking in the threatening sight before her And
the death it’s capable of

The Lodge she thought she knew most certainly a lie

INT STAIRWELL THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY
A lie slowly realized by our trio as they race down its
ostentatious steps two at a time Ava notably limping Their
paced movements inflaming her stitched wound
AVA
(mid-stride)
We shouldn’t have left him

CARTER
We had no choice

They reach the bottom step crossing into the --

LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Wasting no time in their approach to its magnificent front
doors

AVA
(sotto)
Please-
She forces down the doors’ golden handle

Meeting immediate resistance Its frame cruelly LOCKED

CARTER
Goddamn bastards

AVA
Try the windows

Mikayla peers through their frames at the steel window covers
staring right back

MIKAYLA
Fortified

CARTER
All of them

Mikayla cranes her neck in the direction of the LIVING ROOM
Its glinting windows likewise shrouded by steel

MIKAYLA
(nods)
Jesus

CARTER
Fuckin’ eh they’re trapping us in

AVA
(realizing)
They’re doing more than that

She shakes her head slowly comprehending the vile nature of
their predicament

AVA (CONTD)
First rule of hunting always
contain the grounds

CARTER
(surprised)
You hunt

AVA
(shakes her head)
Nah but my Dad did Even tried to
take me out a couple times I never
did fire that gun but I heard his
goddamn rules at least a hundred
times

MIKAYLA
(desperation mounting)
So you’re saying

She swallows hard barely able to bring herself to muster--

MIKAYLA (CONTD)

(terrified)
-you’re saying there’s no way
out
AVA

(nods solemnly)
Not here But doesn’t mean there
isn’t one

Her thoughts circulate before she remembers--

AVA (CONTD)

There’s an old-school passageway
kinda back by the dining room We
found it earlier No idea where it
leads but I think it’s our best
shot-

She scans their dark interior eying the concierge’s desk and
the dismal MANAGER’S OFFICE behind it Gesturing towards
them
AVA (CONTD)
But let’s at least try and finda
light or a working phone while
were here yeah

The other two nod their uneasy agreement as she leads them in
that direction

While we slowly DRIFT past them

UP the daunting flight of stairs to its top step
Now peering through the darkness at

A TAXIDERMY WOLF HEAD

Resting on top of a standing black suit A 270 millimeter
GYUTO BLADE glinting in his gloved fist

Observing our trio from a distance Shrouded in the safety of
the shadows

Knowing that he is capable of cornering his prey whenever he
pleases

But the hunt is just too damn exhilarating

INT ARMORY SECRET PASSAGEWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Athena sets down her ax perusing her vile and violent
options A katana A chainsaw Even a fucking Shiv

She settles on a hefty-bladed hunting knife Efficient Would
do the trick if push came to stab

She feels the weapon in her hand uneasily Running her
fingers over its hilt

Gathers herself Her belongings

And inches out into the tunnel Alert eyes scanning its
depths for company The coast clear

Veering in the opposite direction in which the Deer and Bear
were headed

CUT TO

INT MANAGER’S OFFICE THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Disheveled and dreary Large industrial file cabinets
Archaic electronics A desk littered with papers Even a Big
Mouth Billy Bass adorns its walls

The room welcomes our trio who quickly scan its perimeter in
a desperate search for the instruments they need

Rifling through its drawers for a flashlight

Carter’s gaze darting towards a red landline Rotary dial and
all

He picks up its phone only to hear the obnoxious DRONE that
confirms its useless state

CARTER
(bummed)
Disconnected

Ava pulls back a manila folder in a desk drawer to find

A black tactical FLASHLIGHT A welcoming sight in all this
hell

She waves it to the other two

AVA
Not so futile after all

She turns on its bulb light returning to our dim space Its
beam dancing across the interior

She illuminates a pair of framed photographs on the desk One
of which features Mr and Mrs Palfrey holding an upside down
tiger between the two of them

Astute eyes will notice that the former grips a large hunting
knife reminiscent of the very blade Athena now carries

CARTER
Smug old bastards

He shakes his head frustrated

CARTER (CONTD)

What kind of fucking shit did they

get us into
A question that lingers on all our minds as we HOLD on their
smiling photographed faces
INT SECRET PASSAGEWAY THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY
Athena prods through its dark Blade at the ready LED
lanterns flickering all around her Their collective glow

illuminating the tunnel’s end now looming before her

A wood-paneled WALL equipped with a sterling silver handle A
stark deviation from the tunnel’s dark facade

She grips its metallic body Cold to the touch
Takes a deep breath
Before pulling down Sliding its frame

Finding herself miraculously in the --

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Standing to the left of the record player The wall before
her having parted for her entrance

The passageway behind her covertly traversing the entire
Lodge Our interior labyrinth a sinister mechanism of travel
for the terrors that lurk within its walls

She stares out at the darkness before her the full gravity
of her location setting in

This is definitively a hunting ground

One that she is utterly stuck in it

INT HALLWAY THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The flashlight’s beam dances across the dark interior before
them Our trio slinking down its length carefully

Eerie enough during the day at night this trek is
excruciating

Our eyes jerk warily to the walls our knowledge of the
passageway beyond it triggering a perpetual sense of
paranoia

While an uneasy Ava leads the duo into the --

DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Its table long since cleared The birds of prey on its walls
watching the entering party with still dead eyes

While Carter meets their gaze with a look of disgust Ava
approaches its back wall -- the same wall from which Mr
Palfrey crashed into her earlier

She feels along its wooden frame its paneling slightly
disconnected from the wall around it

So she gives its body a gentle push Its hinges slowly
WHINING as it parts--

Revealing a SECOND darker HALLWAY
A hallway the other two guests stare down with confused eyes

MIKAYLA
How’d you know ‘bout that

AVA
Long story Very boring

She directs their beam into the foreboding darkness before
them

And takes a careful step into its ominous fray

LOBBY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Athena creaks through the shadowed interior
Step

By trembling step

Her blade and flickering matches leading the way

Oblivious to the WOLF observing from the top step above

HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY
Too dark Too silent

Hunting pictures of smiling Palfreys and slaughtered animals
accentuating the vile mood

A timid Mikayla scans her new surroundings fearfully An
unsettled Carter prods behind

Ava still leads pacing along its right wall as she ventures
deeper down the passageway until--

Reaching a DOOR on their right Gracing down its handle to
open up on the --

THE TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Expansive beyond belief Possibly the largest room in the
Lodge Its ceiling towering Ava’s flashlight illuminating

mere glimpses of the oddity it houses

Row after row of TAXIDERMY ANIMALS covered by white sheets

Hundreds of them if not a thousand Full specimens standing
upright or on all fours

Aisle after aisle of sheeted beast after sheeted beast
Regimented and organized like a hunter’s rendition of the
Terracotta Soldiers

By the looks of it a room full of ghosts

Her face a combination of shock and awe Ava approaches the
nearest specimen

Yanking off its cover to reveal
A FEARSOME TIGER Orange and black fur triumphant and

pristine Its yellow eyes still but piercing Its ferocious
snarl preserved for eternity

CARTER
What even is this place

As all three have no answer to his quandary while--

DINING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Athena gingerly enters the fray Eying the open passageway at
the far side of the room warily

Clutching her knife tighter Her mind wrought with thoughts
of the unspeakable terrors that await her

MIKAYLA (0S)
It’s fucking creepy that’s what it
is

THE TROPHY ROOM - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The trio peruses their environment carefully Taking off the
occasional white sheet when their curiosity gets the better
of them

MIKAYLA
What’s this supposed to be anyway
The reject room for every dead
animal that didn’t make the lobby

The three of them pace down the same central aisle Eying
the hooded beasts that surround them

CARTER
I think them old timers got
themselves a pretty serious hunting
addiction

Avas gaze continues to follow the beam of her light Pacing
down the ominous aisle before her

AVA
There’s gotta be an exit here
somewhere

MIKAYLA
Ain’t no windows This place is too
damn dusty for light

She pulls off the sheet of a grazing ANTELOPE Its majestic
horns preserved in death

CARTER
Kinda makes you wonder what else is
hidden if a room this big was down
a secret passageway

He removes one off a dignified ZEBRA Its posture perfected
in its stuffed state

While Ava’s sweeping beam momentarily crosses--

THE DEER Standing in the darkness at the far end of the
room STARTLING her--

She quickly doubles back but he’s disappeared her beam
catching nothing in its return to his spot The room’s eerie
stillness convincingly lifeless again

She shrugs it off resuming her search for an exit as if
nothing had happened But we can tell from her shaking beam
that she’s deeply rattled

MIKAYLA
Or what kind of creepy ass place
has so much shit hidden in the
first place

She unveils a black PANTHER Its dark form surprisingly
uncanny

AVA
Or what sick joke of a hunting
lodge actually has its own guests
hunted

He disrobes a LEOPARD Its spotted hide a clash of colors
even under our shroud of darkness

AVA (CONTD)
(on second thought)
Or if it’s really even a hunting
lodge at all

Mikayla cranes her eyes towards a peculiar looking specimen
now directly before her

Standing upright on two legs under its white sheet Tall and
menacing Sparking her curiosity

MIKAYLA
Yo Ava Shine that shit over here
one sec This one’s shape’s kinda
wonky
Without thinking Ava quickly directs her beam at the sheeted
beast that Mikayla has already begun to reveal-- illuminating
the SHEET’s removal for just a split second BEFORE--

This happens so fast we barely have time to comprehend the
action

BEAR HEAD-- BLACK SUIT-- AX CRASHING-- MIKAYLA’S HEAD-- BLOOD
EVERYWHERE

Ava and Carter unable to even process the horrific turn of
events

Mouths agape Eyes huge Staring bewilderingly at --
THE BEAR

Stepping down from his perch atop a decorative stand of black
rock

Removing a white handkerchief from inside his suit pocket

Wiping the blood off his glinting silver AX

Directing his gaze down to the grisly body of Mikayla The
blood splatter having soiled the white sheet of the animal
directly across from him

He shrugs brushing her corpse aside

As he begins to pace down the aisle of sheeted animals to the
still shocked forms of Carter and Ava

The latter now directing her flashlight into the eyes of
their approaching killer

BLUE And very much human underneath his bear fagade
But our duo are weaponless Helpless Hopeless
Slowly retreating backwards to the room’s far wall
As the beast gets closer

--closer

--and CLOSER

Twisting his ax in his hands gleefully
Relishing in the prospect of more killing
WHEN--—

He suddenly speaks the act alone startling us like a jump
scare

THE BEAR
You have no idea what kind of sport
you just stepped into do you

Our two are too terrified to respond Precipitating a smile
from our killer that we never see

As he grips his ax joyously preparing to strike--

WHEN A BLADE BURSTS THROUGH HIS STOMACH

Sudden Abrasive And primal

Blood soaking through his impeccable suit Wound ghastly and
dire

He falls to his knees His strength fleeting

Collapsing to the floor in a defeated heap

Revealing ATHENA standing behind him Hunting knife extended
and bloodied

Staring at our duo with a mixture of horror and relief

ATHENA
I thought-
(tears welling)
I thought you guys were all dead

A rattled Ava shakes her head running over and embracing her
friend Who turns around and hugs an approaching Carter as
well

These three strangers united in the horrific circumstances in
which they find themselves Finding solace in that fact
alone

Too grateful for each other to notice the sound of a WALL
closing shut as our DEER escapes back into the Lodge’s
passageway

Leaving our new trio in the dark interior surrounded by rows
and rows of dead animals

Joined by the bleeding body of Mikayla Still and dead on the
trophy room floor

Now finished with their pleasant exchange a stern Athena
turns to the two of them with a serious look in her eyes

ATHENA (CONTD)
Come on I need to show you
something

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM THE LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

Flashlight before them our trio cranes their eyes down the
dark passageway

The wall parted and open Faint LED lights flickering along a
path slithering towards a vanishing point of impenetrable
darkness

AVA
(terrified)
And you say this connects to our
bedrooms

ATHENA
My guess would be the entire house

She grimaces at the thought

ATHENA (CONTD)
It’s how they get around so
seamlessly Popping in and out
unnoticed Catching us when we’re
most vulnerable

CARTER
They being those-

ATHENA
Animal heads Yeah Don’t let the
suits fool you Those killing fucks
are the farthest things from
classy

She gestures to Ava’s flashlight

ATHENA (CONTD)
Which is why you need to turn that
off Draws too much attention

Ava nods Flicking its switch

AVA
So you’re saying this is our best
chance at an exit

ATHENA
Bastards had to have gotten in
somewhere And that somewhere can
be our way out

CARTER
And if you’re wrong

ATHENA
(resigned)
There’s only one way to find out

He nods accepting the hopeless reality of their predicament
Directing his attention forward

CARTER
Shall we

He extends a leading hand down into the tunnel’s depths

Athena nods taking an intrusive step into its interior
Followed now by the others All three disappearing into the
passageway

Oblivious to the FIGURE that lurks in the living room behind
them
A figure watching from under the cover of the room’s curtain
barely visible through its translucent fabric Only the shape
of his mask giving away his identity
THE FOX
Emerging now from his hiding spot Clutching his Navajo blade
close to his chest Visually tracking his helpless victims’
venture into the perilous unknown

A sight now visible to us on a

SURVEILLANCE SCREEN

Situated within --

INT CONTROL ROOM UNKNOWN LOCATION - SIMULTANEOUSLY

As we slowly PULL back getting more and more of its
unsettling interior

A mosaic of SCREENS suspended up on its wall Twenty Thirty
Forty Possibly even a hundred

Covering every nook and cranny of the Lodge Every square
foot accounted for Every space visualized

This is the hub of the Lodge

The GLOVED hands of its observer dancing across its electric
control board Sifting through its colorful pastiche of
buttons

Changing perspectives on the screens Following our unknowing
trio as they continue their trek down the secret passageway

Our CAMERA now giving us a purview of the observers
identity

PULLING back to reveal the masked extent of his facial
region His elegant black suit His perfect Windsor tie

THE WOLF
Terrifyingly focused on the task at hand The green eyes
beneath his mask scanning the screens before him with the

upmost diligence

His sinister smile shrouded by his masks snout

INT SECRET PASSAGEWAY - LATER

Athena in front the trio continues to trek deeper into the
shadowy fray the LED lanterns lighting their way

ATHENA
Watch your left

Their eyes pick up the entrance to a room emerging on the
side of the tunnel Their pace coming to a gradual halt as
they approach it

Upon arriving they veer left through its threshold into what
we recognize as the ARMORY

Our group stares out at the emporium of weaponry before them
A grim expression crossing Carter’s face as he takes in the
wide variety of killing instruments at their disposal

CARTER
Jesus

She starts to rifle through the inventory Whipping through
an assortment of blades Pocketing a cluster of DYNAMITE

ATHENA
Grab whatever you can

Carter equips himself with a slew of tactical weapons
Gripping the steel edge of a contemporary crossbow

While Ava picks up an obsidian BOWIE KNIFE Weighing it in
her palm Staring at it hesitantly

AVA
Are we really gonna-

She can’t even bring herself to finish
ATHENA
Ava you want to get out of here
alive
Ava nods slowly
ATHENA (CONTD)
Then think of this as trying to

ensure that

She shrugs her shoulders

ATHENA (CONTD)
The rest is just not thinking

CUT TO

INT SECRET PASSAGEWAY - LATER

Our trio slinks deeper into the fray passing series after
series of tributary tunnels branching off the main flow Each
of them leading to unknown corners of our Lodge

A close cluster of eight now comes into view Contextually
we gather that they’re connected to the guest bedrooms

CARTER
(sick to his stomach)
Damn bastards had such easy
access Kept us locked in
Vulnerable Easy to pick off one-by-
one

Carter’s somber eyes drift to his feet

CARTER (CONTD)
This place man- it’s just a
fuckin’ slaughterhouse

ATHENA
(dark)
I know

She pauses Mulling over her next thought carefully

ATHENA (CONTD)
But like the thing about
slaughterhouses is- in every
single one of ‘em someone does the
slaughter Usually it’s some poor
soul hacking away for 1050 an
hour and health insurance

The tunnel before them nears a large illuminated opening an
unknown ROOM at its end

ATHENA (CONTD)
But here Here we have no idea who
that someone is And that’s even
more terrifying because were
the ones being led to slaughter

MEANWHILE

INT LIVING ROOM THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The FOX and DEER take their first steps into the passageway
Brushing past its open wall Tailing their unknowing victims
with pace

INT LOCKER ROOM SECRET PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Victims that have now ventured up the last few feet of the
tunnel crossing the threshold and into the mysterious

room

A space we immediately recognize from its metallic elevator
fingerprint sensor and luxurious amenities --

Our UNKNOWN LOCATION fully realized

Visually think an elevated Equinox locker room -- pristine
and lustrous with a brutalist flair A country club aesthetic
meets the sleek interior of Patrick Bateman’s boxing gym

Open steel lockers showcase designer sport coats hung from
wooden hangers Unused fur masks line their upper echelons
their shelves otherwise spotless

An aluminum bench splits our rows of lockers The fresh
towels that adorn its reflective surface are all folded and
pressed

Dark tiled showers lurk in an elegant bathroom beyond our
back wall Its delectable interior certainly inviting

But despite this immaculate appearance Ava’s attention
instead drifts to something else entirely Something that
actively demands our entire trio’s gaze

For suspended up by the ceiling near the room’s back wall is
A FLAT SCREEN TELEVISION

Motion sensitive TRIGGERED ON by their entry

On which we WATCH

The beginnings of a short video that almost makes us forget
our horror genre

Its opening punctuated by alluring shots of the majestic
American landscape Snow blanketing an evergreen forest wind
whipping across amber waves of grain a purple sun setting on
the Appalachians etc

All before we FADE IN on

MR PALFREY

Standing before these beautiful images in another rendition
of seductive corporate advertising If youre having a hard
time picturing this think of the transcendent imagery of a
Malick film but repurposed as an ad for Goldman Sachs

FADE TO BLACK

Returning us to our

LOCKER ROOM

Where our three stare up at the screen Fear of the unknown
now replaced by a boiling anger Understanding the full
horror of their situation and its depraved implications

Avas eyes even catch a white board on the room’s far wall
that reads

A WARM WELCOME TO THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF WELLINGTON CAPITAL

Her heart sinks Anchored down by a growing rage

Athena stands fuming next her Carter shaking his head in
disgust

CARTER
Those rich fucks

He spits for emphasis as a silence builds amongst the three

Prompting a rattled Ava to prod forward past the lockers and
into the --

CONTROL ROOM

Hearing a livid Athena mouth off to her as she follows Ava
inside both of them staring up at the mosaic of screens
before them

ATHENA
So what We were just gathered
here as prey

Ava silently feels across its control panel The array of
buttons before her warm from recent use

ATHENA (CONTD)
Nothing here was ever about
hospitality or having “interesting
souls” around a goddamn dinner
table It was all an outright lie

AVA
I know

Ava brings her attention to a red one on its upper right

ATHENA
Half of us were homeless for
Christ’s sake

And ever so carefully PRESSES it

ATHENA (CONTD)
(shaking her head)
To be killed by the rich for a
fucking price

Watching the FLOOR disappear in a dark HALLWAY on a
surveillance screen to her left Its gape revealing a spiked
snare trap below Its sharpened ends capable of skewering
anyone or anything that falls in its path

ATHENA (CONTD)

Just a pretty penny for some lazy
weekend leisure killing right
Wrong- it’s more than that This is
killing two birds with one stone
Entertainment that simultaneously
wipes out those that don’t
matter

Ava grimaces as the visual reality of the house’s hunting
ground sinks in

ATHENA (CONTD)
the socially inferior

She carefully withdraws her hand from the control panel

ATHENA (CONTD)
the financially forgotten

Now seeing the FOX and DEER race up the secret passageway
towards them

ATHENA (CONTD)
Never to be heard from again

Disappearing and reappearing from one surveillance screen to
the next

ATHENA (CONTD)
No one to come looking No one to
care

Both of their axes visible from our feed

ATHENA (CONTD)
This is not just murder This is
Social Darwinism in its most
capitalist form

Threatening even in this voyeuristic light

ATHENA (CONTD)
And we are its victims We were
selected against

Ava senses Carter enter the control room behind them A look
of deep disgust ingrained on his face A disgust that grows
deeper and deeper as he peers up at the screens before him

AVA
(without turning around)
You guys see that

She gestures towards the approaching duo

CARTER
Yeah I do

AVA
You thinking what I’m thinking

CARTER
If that involves a lot of senseless
violence then yes

He pauses a stern seriousness crossing his face

CARTER (CONTD)
But first you need to see this

CUT TO

INT BATHROOM LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Our trio stands before a sight so sickening even the power
lifter in the back of the theatre vomits in his bag of cheat
day popcorn

A makeshift operating table has been jammed up against the
shower wall Brayden’s violated corpse positioned on top its
metallic frame

Deep surgical cuts riddle his exposed torso No rhyme or
reason to the incisions Their sheer number excessive and
unmedical If anything they seem merely exploratory

A small assisting table provides clues of the vile actions
that unfolded a scalpel a bone saw and a power drill rest
among other terrifying instruments of torture

Our black shower walls host the operation’s splash zone a
dripping splatter work Its floor comparatively less
artistic flesh blood and excess tissue soiling its tile

That disturbing knot you feel in your stomach while you read
this well it’s a thousand times worse for our trio

ATHENA
I can’t fucking look at that

She redirects her gaze away We notice Ava’s eyes geared at
her feet Even Carter can’t stomach its sight

CARTER
You know- I’ve seen shit in my
life Men women children- all
slaughtered Bodies blown to pieces
by IED’s Parts of the human body
that the skin hides for good
reason But that- that was war

He pauses swallowing painfully

CARTER (CONTD)
This This is something else
Something worse A sick fucked up
sport that these rich assholes play
because they can

He angrily turns his back on the carnage Heading back out of
the bathroom

CARTER (CONTD)
So fuck that And fuck this This
is war- a war we have no choice but
to fight Because if we don’t
well just end up like Asian muscle
boy over there Some sick perv’s
dirty fuckin’ entertainment

He crosses into the --

LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Followed by Ava and Athena Now gesturing towards the
elevator on the opposite wall

CARTER
That the exit

Ava nods

He moves towards it forcibly inserting his hands between its
frames Desperately trying to pry them apart

But to no avail

Athena even tries the fingerprint sensor Its red light
flashing BEEPING -- access denied

ATHENA
Guess not for us Which means our
only way out-

AVA
(breaking her silence)
-is through Thing One and Thing
Two

Athena and Carter turn towards her acknowledging the stern
resolution on her face

ATHENA
(nods)
Alright

CARTER
Alright is right
(beat)
Time to kill these mother fuckers

While they quickly gather their weapons our attention drifts
to something beyond them
A slight disturbance
Unnoticed by our trio but noticed by us

A supply closet on the room’s perimeter Its door slightly
ajar --

Slowly CREAKING OPEN under our gaze
Merely a centimeter at a time But moving nonetheless

Confirming the presence of someone or something hidden beyond
its frame

In the same room as our unsuspecting trio

CUT TO

INT SECRET PASSAGEWAY - MINUTES LATER
FOOTSTEPS Two sets DRESS SHOES Hugo Boss

Echoing from deep behind us as we PUSH through our tunnel
towards the LOCKER ROOM

Finding two eyes--

Peering out from behind the room’s threshold Looking deep
into the dark passageway Monitoring its interior

Both belonging to Ava Her body pressed against its wall the
rooms FIRE EXTINGUISHER cordoning her hidden position

The FOOTSTEPS continue Their pace relentless
Getting closer and closer by the second
AVA
(whispering)

So when they walk through

She directs her nervous attention back behind her to Athena
and Carter -- both standing armed and ready

CARTER
(whispering)
Knife to the throat Don’t think
Just stab We got Thing Two

He gestures to his crossbow -- a proverbial “we”

AVA
(whispering)
Roger that

She takes a deep breath gaze returning to the tunnel
Listening to the CLACKING of DRESS SHOES on cement floor

A daunting two-step building in pitch

Louder and louder the closer they get

The wall’s LED’s now catching two SHADOWS Larger-than-life
forms dancing across the tunnel interior

Tall Lengthy Terrifying
The outline of their masks animalistic permitting their
silhouettes to live for just a brief second as mutants a
shadow hybrid between man and beast
CARTER
(whispering)

Get ready

The three begin to brace for combat Their tension palpable
Their gaze stern

But just as the two shadows near their purview we notice
THE WOLF

Slinking behind our preoccupied trio His steps unheard His
approach covert

Our closet dweller out in the open Inching towards an
unsuspecting Carter

Gyuto blade extended Glinting Ready to kill While--
AVA

stares down into the passage’s depths The shadows getting
smaller and smaller until

The FOX and DEER come into view

Their forms haunting in the tunnel’s darkness Their masks
deeply sinister Blood-curdling even

Both prompting Ava to turn around quickly to warn the
others

Only to see the WOLF--

AVA
Carter Watch out

DRIVE HIS GYUTO THROUGH CARTERS NECK

The action so sudden So abrasive So precise

The carotid artery severed Our final two WATCHING in utter
horror as--

Blood CASCADES from the wound SPLATTERING down his chest
SOAKING his clothes

If the National Park Service hired Tarantino to reboot
Niagara Falls it would look like this

While we watch Carter’s body crumple in an ocean of carnage
the Wolf stands up behind him

Wiping his Gyuto on his black slacks

Turning to his prey with a fresh blade Lavishing in the
tense moment as he approaches

A moment that only lasts
A few painful seconds
WHEN-—

THWACK

Athena CLATTERS the FIRE EXTINGUISHER against his SKULL

Our heroine having unhinged the device from the wall while we
trembled over Carter’s remains Delivering an immediate but
brief blackout

ATHENA
We need to get out of here right
now

She quickly reaches for the Wolf’s arm and along with Ava
drags his unconscious body in the direction of the elevator

Promptly using his finger to press the door’s sensor

The system recognizing his touch The panel sliding away
Athena presses its “DOWN” button

Waiting with Ava for the doors to part Both their eyes

craned towards the tunnel where the Fox and Deer SPRINT
towards the threshold towards them

Come on come on

The Wolf even begins to stir on the ground

Any minute now

Finally the elevator DINGS

Its door opening to reveal its sleek metallic interior

As they both file inside Hearing the CLACKING of the Fox and
Deer’s shoes against the Locker Room floor

Fuck-- theyve made it

Athena desperately reaching for the “Close Doors” button A
panicking Ava deciding between the two buttoned floors

ATHENA (CONTD)
Just press the DOWN one

Ava does precisely that the doors now CLOSING WAY too
slowly

ATHENA (CONTD)
(muttering)
Youve gotta be kidding me

The Wolf slowly rising to his feet before them Consciousness
returning Grabbing at his blade

ATHENA (CONTD)
(to the doors)
Go you fuckers Gol
Inches away from shutting

Centimeters now

WHEN AN AX CLAWS into the RIGHT DOOR-- VIOLENTLY RESISTING
its force--

The Fox and Deer emerging PULLING the DOORS apart with all
their mite

And for a second they just might do it The girls’ lives
hanging in the balance

But the door’s momentum is just too strong
Speeding SHUT with a salvaging CLANG

Deep breaths emanating from both Ava and Athena as the
elevator immediately kicks to life

Descending down into the depths of God knows where leaving
the three masked horrors behind

AVA
Whew

ATHENA
You can say that again

They sit there in an exhausted silence until the elevator
comes to a gentle stop Reaching its destination one floor
below

A mellow DING announcing its parting DOORS --

INT STERILE HALLWAY BENEATH THE LODGE - CONTINUOUS

A spotless future-chic wall stares back at a newly arrived
Ava and Athena No decor No personality No nothing

Growing exceedingly wary the two of them carefully step out
into the fray Taking in the bizarre interior with nervous
eyes --

White metallic and immaculate our UNKNOWN HALLWAY from
before fully realized

To their left and right the over-lit passageway seemingly
extends into oblivion Low-hanging LED’s blur its edges
creating a mirage of spatial perpetuity

Not a single sign of life is present within its aseptic
depths Visibly the complete antithesis of the wooded
taxidermy-abundant interior of the Lodge a floor above

ATHENA
The fuck

They both take a moment to digest its peculiar appearance

ATHENA (CONTD)
So this shit was just sitting under
us the entire time

Avas desperate eyes peer down its endless halls searching
for their needed exit

AVA
How are we supposed to get out of
here

Her question becomes all the more pressing when the elevator
doors suddenly close behind them

Followed by its abrupt SURGE UP as it begins its venture back
to the LOCKER ROOM

AVA (CONTD)
Shit They must’ve-

ATHENA
-quick

She grabs Ava’s shoulder as they immediately bee-line down
the left hall

Sprinting with an unforgivable pace White walls blurring in
their wake

Their CLACKING footsteps becoming a chorus with the hallway’s
HUMMING generators

ATHENA (CONTD)
We need something Anything

As they now reach a series of grey industrial doors
Breaking off separately Trying their sensors desperately
Their fingerprints denied

AVA
We’re locked in

She tries another door to no avail Slamming her fist against
its frame

AVA (CONTD)
Goddamnit

They continue to race forward adrenaline in the drivers
seat

Past the carpeted hallway from earlier The slew of hotel
rooms visible for just a second as our duo sprints on

Nervous eyes perpetually craning back towards the elevators
Panic brimming up inside

Their fate on the wire Precious seconds ticking away as they
RUN

INT LOCKER ROOM - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The elevator arrives with a triumphant DING Its DOORS
parting for our terrible trio while --

INT STERILE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ava’s frustrated fingers unsuccessfully try another sensor
Its door labeled “PARKING GARAGE”

AVA
They even got a lot down here

ATHENA

Probably full of rich ass cars we

can’t escape in

Her nervous eyes crane back to the elevator far behind them
ATHENA (CONTD)
(manic)

Oh God were so fucking fucked
AVA

There’s gotta be another way out of

here

And just as she says it we see it

An unattended LAUNDRY CART on their left The duo quickly
nearing its steel hull

Now both noticing what we see directly above its hamper is
the opening to a laundry chute

The beginning of a glinting silver vent system Its path a
steady incline from the cart traveling up its wall before
disappearing into the ceiling to the Lodge above

A hopeful Ava quickly turns to Athena an idea coming to the
surface

INT STERILE HALLWAY THE LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

Still and empty

The metallic doors to our elevator shaft static prior to
its

Echoing DING

Announcing the arrival of our fearsome trio Its parting
doors revealing --

The FOX DEER and WOLF

All three now armed with HUNTING RIFLES

Slinking out of the elevator and down our immaculate
corridor No sign of Ava or Athena anywhere
They quietly file forward

Silently communicating to each other with military-esque
signals

Each of their steps punctuated by the bone-chilling sound of
their DRESS SHOES on industrial ground

Their black suits matching our white walls delectably

Their movements down the corridor’s depths simultaneously
both cautious and excitable

Growing closer and closer to the vents with each passing
second

Vents we now PUSH towards

Their glinting silver walls inauspicious Their gradual
incline as still as can be

But as we DRIFT near its frame

We notice a slight crack in its body

A crack through which

An EYE stares

Right back at us Its dark pupil dilated in fear
Fear we get CLOSER and CLOSER to

Until we join it within the --

INT VENTS STERILE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Claustrophobic Metallic Suffocating
Our eye belonging to a trembling Athena as she and Ava slowly
inch up the vent’s shaft Careful not to make a sound
Knowing their very lives depend on it
AVA
(mouths )

They’re here

Athena nods

ATHENA
(mouths )
And armed
Ava does the universal “come again” face
ATHENA (CONTD)
(mouths )
Guns
Terror joins Ava’s perplexed expression
AVA
(mouths )
Whered they get

Athena shrugs abandoning her lookout to crawl a mere foot up
the shaft Ava following suit

Still both wary of avoiding noise Powering forward
nonetheless But even the least keen eyes will notice

Theres a newfound desperation to their movements

INT STERILE HALLWAY THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The terrible trio having ventured deeper into its fray
Guns trained before them Nearing the front line of doors
The macabre chorus of their FOOTSTEPS continuous

The DEER clocks the first sensor on his right Understanding
its implicit obstacle

Turning to his fellow hunters nodding Their prey cant be
far--

INT VENTS STERILE HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The very same prey continue to race against the clock
Pulling their bodies forward up the incline Clothes scraping
against its metallic floor Desperate eyes craned forward

ATHENA
(whispering)
Just- keep- going

INT STERILE HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The hunters slink past their hotel rooms without a moment’s
hesitation The laundry cart now approaching on their left

Their FOOTSTEPS slow as their RIFLES turn to its hull

Each of them growing visibly still Surrounding what they
believe to be their prey’s only hiding spot

The FOX runs point Approaching the cart with prodding steps

Peering over its edges at the mass of white towels kept
within its frame

His gloved fingers reach forward abruptly PEELING back its
first cotton layer--

Finding no cowering bodies

Instead just more towels

He now roughly rifles deeper into its mound Finding no prey
buried beneath the fluff

As he turns around frustrated the slightest sound of
movement catches his attention

He turns back still and silent Listening carefully for
There it is again 100

A body Moving Coming from DEEP within the--

INT VENTS STERILE HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The sound of his BREATHING now echoing within the shaft
Both our heroes hearing this

Suddenly stopping

Terror creeping across their faces as they realize the source
of the disturbance And the sudden danger they find

themselves in

ATHENA
Jesus fuck GO

They POWER forward CRAWLING for their lives JUST AS--

BANG

A BULLET SMASHES through the VENT WALL-- BURSTING through its
METAL-- COLLIDING into its opposite wall--

BANG

A SECOND SOARS above Athena’s trailing FEET--
BANG

A THIRD nearly SPLATTERS Ava’s SKULL--

BANG

A FOURTH RICOCHETS past Athena’s extended HAND--

Athena PULLING herself through the top a vent straightaway
on the Lodge’s first floor Ava mere centimeters behind her
About to join WHEN--

BANG

The Wolf’s final BULLET BLASTS through the VENT’S WALL--

GRAZING her trailing CALF-- PIERCING SKIN-- BLOOD SHOOTING
from its entry-- SPLATTERING on its metallic walls--

Ava lets loose a painful SCREAM as Athena PULLS her up to the
straightaway

Eyes quickly directed to her wound

ATHENA
You okay

Ava brings her fingers to her bloody calf Feeling around its
vindicated skin Wincing but realizing its lack of depth

AVA
(exasperated)
Don’t think it entered
ATHENA
Good because even it did we still
gotta get the fuck out of here
Wasting no time she crawls forward Ava ignoring the pain
and following A small trail of blood in her wake While--
INT STERILE HALLWAY BENEATH THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY
Indiscernible SHOUTING echoes in our cavernous corridor
The three hunters sprinting back to the elevator Gloved
hands desperately JAMMING its “UP” button
INT MANAGER’S OFFICE THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

A laundry shaft just above its floor comes CLATTERING open as
Athena forces her way through

Pulling up Ava behind her Both staring into the room’s
dreary darkness

ATHENA
You okay to run

AVA
I’‘1l be in a world of pain ten
times worse if I’m not

Athena silently concurs as they bolt forward out of the room

While the elevator DOOR parts for the three savages

Ava and Athena now racing past the triumphant taxidermy
lion The former powering through her wound as they come to a
stop before the front door

AVA
What are we doing It’s locked

Which is why I grabbed this

She removes the cluster of DYNAMITE from inside her blouse
Taken earlier from the armory

Oh God really

Greeting the trio POWERING down its steps with a resounding--
-- THWA-BOOM --

The air seemingly combusts

Our world disintegrating in an ABRASIVE FLASH A hurricane of
FIRE touching ground as

The doors DETONATE-- EXPLODING in a vibrant vortex of wood
and metal-- an ORCHESTRA of FLAMES-- a SYMPHONY of
DESTRUCTION crescendoing in a deafening cacophony

Our vision momentarily lost in a FORMIDABLE BLACK SMOKE
Yet we hear COUGHING coming from deep within it

Now joined by the sound of SPRINTING FOOTSTEPS

The smoke slowly parting for us to witness

Ava and Athena DARTING through the BURNING CARNAGE

Racing out onto the --

EXT FRONT PORCH THE LODGE - CONTINUOUS
Climbing down its steps two at a time
Running out into the vast MEADOW before them

Its overgrown grass WHIPPING past their knees as they scurry
forward

A FULL MOON overlooking the carnal pursuit

Ava bearing her bleeding CALF

Bent on reaching the thicket of FOREST beyond the field
Too determined to look back at the porch behind them

A porch that demands their attention WHEN--

BANG

A BULLET WHIZZES OVERHEARD FLYING past them

BANG

A SECOND FALLS SHORT

The hunters FIRING from the front porch Having crossed the
burning wreckage of the door Bent on stopping their prey
OUR WOMEN
powering forward Undeterred Relentless
THE HUNTERS

storming down its steps SHOOTING as they run into the
meadow

ATHENA
Ava Start zigzagging

BULLETS WHISTLE through the air Disappearing amongst the
lengthy blades of grass

A perpetual chorus of BANG’s reverberate across our otherwise
Walden-esque environment

The chase vilely disrupting its serenity
OUR WOMEN

whisking through the meadow Their routes circular and
calculated Dodging bullets left and right

THE HUNTERS

gaining on them FIRING recklessly Missing them over and
over again

OUR WOMEN

now BURSTING into the woods Their sprint continuous Never
looking back

THE HUNTERS

firing their final rounds into the dark thicket before
coming to a halt before its treeline

Gathering themselves Reloading their weapons Whispering
quietly

Before beginning a gentle stroll into its wooded depths

Their lack of urgency indicative of something sinister beyond
our knowledge

Something that makes them unworried about their prey escaping
tonight

INT FOREST - SIMULTANEOUSLY

Something that comes to full realization just minutes later
Our two SPRINTING past blurred evergreens

Navigating its labyrinth of foliage

SPLASHING across a shallow creek bed

Hurdling fallen timbers

Before reaching a second CLEARING that reveals all

The grass here having long since died out Its sight dreary
and uninviting This natural ecosystem vanquished by the

daunting barrier standing tall before them

An ELECTRICAL FENCE that runs along the Lodges perimeter

A yellow sign warns of “HIGH VOLTAGE” A warning unrealized
by the dead illiterate birds that litter the ground near its
base

Both panting the two stand there hands on their knees
Momentarily defeated Definitively trapped within the
property’s contained hell

Avas leg even trembles from the run Blood dribbling
uninhibited from her wound

ATHENA
They don’t give us much choice now
do they

Ava lets loose a harrowed breath before standing back up
Slowly regaining her composure Eyes gradually coming alive
with a newfound ferocity

AVA
We didn’t get much choice to begin
with

Nodding to each other they both turn their backs on the
electrical fence Resigned to their primal fate

Hands now disappearing into back pockets Each of them
procuring their blades This is their only option

ATHENA
You ready

AVA
Don’t make no difference either
way

They take a determined step back into the woods bent on
facing their horrors in the flesh

DISSOLVE TO

INT FOREST - LATER

The FULL MOON peeks through the interwoven foliage at our
eerie battleground Its fray too still Its branches too
silent All its wildlife long since deceased

FOOTSTEPS approach Our hunters prodding across the forest
floor Rifles extended before them Spreading out to cover
more ground Ears perked up scanning for their prey

A CREEK BED is just visible in the distance before them

The very same bed we PUSH towards now where we find --
ATHENA

crouching underneath the overhanging cover of an evergreen’s
roots The mossy terrain’s decline into the creek creating a

makeshift hiding place for her -- a rooted canopy of sorts

Clutching her blade in her fist she sits facing the creek
her back to the approaching hunting party

Their near silent trek the only sound discernible in our
eerily quiet environment

Careful FOOTSTEPS resonate

A progression of dress shoes pressing into damp dirt
A perpetual pitter-patter

Crunching leaves

Breaking twigs

Inching closer and closer by each painful second
Quiet step after quiet step

We dont see them but boy do we feel them

Now nearing our vicinity

Getting so close we can hear their harrowed breathing
The tension is excruciating

Athena now signaling in the direction of a CLOVER FIELD on
her left under which --

AVA
lurks nearly invisible beneath its three-leafed cover Lying
on the soil Still as death Gripping her blade like the

security precaution that it is

Suddenly hearing a single pair of SHOES brush past the
field’s front lines

A BODY now slinking forward through the clover at the field’s
far end

Eager steps navigating the fray

Moving in her direction

Ava unable to see its source beneath the leaf-line
But senses its ever-approaching presence

Cold sweat dripping down the small of her back

As she mentally prepares herself while--

ATHENA

now hears a pair of FOOTSTEPS behind her

Less cautious in their approach

But nonetheless approaching her tree

Coming to a sudden stop before the terrain’s decline into the
creek bed

Resting behind her evergreen
The sound of his MASKED BREATHING emanates
Harrowed and anxious

So LOUD it’s almost as if she feels his breath tickling her
neck

She becomes agonizingly still

Muscles taut

Growing tenser

Bracing for his sudden emergence
But it doesn’t come

At least not yet

Instead he slowly creeps down the terrain decline on her
right

Oblivious to her presence

His black slacks dragging through the dirt The tufts of
orange in his mask revealing his identity -- the FOX

As he nears the creek itself
His RIFLE leading the way
His back vulnerably turned towards the armed Athena

Who clutches her knife all the more tightly in preparation
for her moment while--

AVA

still lies pressed against the soil Staring out at the
labyrinth of clover stems before her

Still hearing the sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS Still
hidden from her hunter’s eyes

When she suddenly notices--

Two DRESS SHOES Three arm lengths away

Now two and closing as--

ATHENA

silently rises to her feet Careful not to make a sound
She takes a quiet step out from underneath her root canopy

Gauging the distance between her and the Fox Roughly ten
yards

Two steps later we’re down to seven

The Fox oblivious to her approach as he gingerly puts a dress
shoe into the creek

Now five yards

The Fox dipping the second shoe into the water JUST AS--
Athena makes a break for it A FULL OUT SPRINT--

Desperately PLUNGING her HUNTING KNIFE into his BACK

Shocking him to his very core as his strength suddenly leaves
his BODY-- unable to continue standing--

Now CRUMPLING to the creek bed in a defeated heap-- BLOOD
staining its brackish water a vile crimson as he dies in its
pool while--

AVA

watches the two shoes before her come to a STOP A response
to the sound of a far-off COMMOTION

A response triggering a sudden--
BANG

The GUNSHOT ringing out in the dark stillness of the forest
Prompting --

ATHENA

to stare down at her chest Noticing a large red WOUND
pooling under her blouse

The pain suddenly reaching her brain Immediately
comprehending her horrific reality

Shes been SHOT

Its entry point becomes excruciating Desperate fingers
prodding down at the wound Trying to stop its outflow

She falls to her knees Letting loose a WHIMPER of agony A
whimper heard by --

AVA

who immediately recognizes Athena’s voice Her pain The
GUNSHOT fired above her oh God

The owner of the SHOES just KILLED her friend
Rattling her to her very core Her eyes betraying her anger
Adrenaline taking the wheel Driving her to do the

unthinkable--

RISING up from her clover hiding place her clothes muddy--
the assailant’s BACK to her-- belonging to the DEER

As she JUMPS ONTO his back-- wrapping her arms around his
neck-- giving him no time to react as she--

CLAWS her fingernails into his masks eye sockets-- driving a
guttural scream from his lungs as she pierces his sclera--

It’s carnal brutal and bloody

Ava HOLDING on for dear life as he wildly STRUGGLES--
desperate to throw her off-- her other hand gripping her
blade tightly before--

THRUSTING it into his NECK-- AGAIN

AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN

BLOOD CASCADES from his wound-- the bloodshed otherworldly--
the masks taxidermy fur now being painted a vile crimson
while he collapses--

Ava landing in an exasperated heap on top of his defeated
frame

Silence returns to our eerie forest exterior

As Ava breathes deeply regaining her composure Shocking
even herself at the line she just crossed WHEN--

A sudden outburst of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS quickly reverberates
across the woods Abrupt and desperate Pace fervent and
animalistic

Ava craning her neck up from the bloodied clover field to
see

A BLACK SUIT darting through the trees Gun flailing at his
side as the WOLF flees for his life Abandoning his two
fallen partners shamelessly

The latter whom Ava now sees as she directs her attention to
the creek bed on her right

Taking in both the Fox and Athena lying in its dark red
water defeated Beyond dead

A stream of tears begins to trickle down her cheeks Mind
racing Somber thoughts meeting those of anger These
monsters did this to us To her To Athena

Avas eyes leave her fallen comrade for the final time
unable to look any longer

Drifting instead to the body of the Deer before her while she
cries

Taking in the splatter on his Armani suit The mud on his
Hugo Boss shoes His Rolex watch still spotless and pristine

Even his now abandoned HUNTING RIFLE reeks of class Its
barrel polished Its stock carved from beautiful oak

So Ava now turns towards the fleeing Wolf Huffing and
puffing as he runs

But there’s something new in her eyes Something vengeful
As she COCKS back the rifle’s hammer

Dark thoughts percolating as she notices just thirty yards
before her --

A single-lane COUNTRY ROAD

Leading through the forest in the direction of the Lodge An
access point to the property

And presumably the only means of escape

Her knowing eyes returning to the dead DEER before her an
idea slowly coming to the surface

EXT FRONT PORCH THE LODGE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

While the Wolf races up the steps inside the sound of an
ENGINE STARTING --

SMASHES US INTO

EXT FIELD BEHIND THE LODGE - LATER

A GRASS MOUND on the field’s outskirts OPENS mechanically
revealing a garage door in camouflage Its mouth positioned
at the beginning of the Lodge’s back road

Its frame parting for the sleek body of an AUDI R8 In
midnight black of course

Lurking behind the wheel is the WOLF Maskless Coiffed hair
Sharp features Clean shaven A true Wolf of Wall Street

His foot SLAMS down on the accelerator as the sports car
ROCKETS to life --

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Headlights peering into the darkness before it the R8 TEARS
through the forest

INT AUDI R8 COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

The elusive voice of Frank Sinatra rises from his radio as
the illustrious vehicle WHIPS past the endless rows of trees

Its foliage blurring in the Wolf’s peripheral The towering
FRONT GATES of the Lodge’s electrical perimeter getting
closer by the second

His gloved hands grip the wheel tightly Bent on escaping the
premises Desperate to flee this growing nightmare

A nightmare that
SUDDENLY and ABRUPTLY RETURNS on the ROAD BEFORE HIM

A DEER visible in his headlights Its fur head craned towards
his rapidly approaching vehicle--

Our hunter SLAMS on his BRAKES two seconds too late--
TIRES SCREECHING-- IMPACT IMMINENT--

The Wolf’s HEADLIGHTS giving him a momentary glance at his
ROAD KILL

And the BLACK ARMANI SUIT it wears

As he realizes exactly which DEER awaits his weapon-on-
wheels

A second before his R8 SLAUGHTERS through his friends body--
CARNAGE SPLATTERING on his wind-shield--

The vehicle blindly PLOWING through the Lodge’s ELECTRIC
GATES-- RIPPING them OFF their hinges in a flurry of SPARKS--

As the Audi VEERS off-road--

And SMASHES into a TREE

The excruciating sound of CRUNCHING METAL and ROARING AIRBAGS
violating our eardrums before we meet --

SILENCE

SMOKE slowly billows from the wreckage The interior of the
car now shrouded in a thick cloud The obnoxious DING of a
seat belt sensor audible

We hear COUGHING from within joined now by the sound of the
door opening The exposure to the outside air giving us
visibility

As the Wolf painfully brings himself out of his --

EXT AUDI R8 - CONTINUOUS

Barely mustering the strength to stand up Wobbling His
balance failing him Clearly concussed from the accident

So concussed that it takes him an extra second to comprehend
the RIFLE now PRESSED into his forehead AVA having emerged
from the treeline for this moment

AVA
Hunt’s over bitch-

Without hesitation she FIRES Point blank Into the WOLFs
FACE

Body crumpling instantly A blood ocean pooling from the
wound

And as his body lies there in still death we notice for the
first time the all too familiar chic shark patterns on his
dress socks

As now still gripping the gun Ava prods beyond the
mechanical carnage of the R8

Past the physical carnage of the Wolf

And now joins the main road Walking in the direction of
super fucking far from here

longer a mystery

Its frame continues to rattle battered by an errant wind as
an armed Ava approaches

She slips through its opening into the night joining the two-
lane rural HIGHWAY beyond it

And as we look up at her ash-ridden face we notice that

A smile finally breaks After a night of unspeakable horrors
she has made it out alive

EXT FRONT PORCH THE LODGE - CONTINUOUS

Mr Palfrey nods solemnly

MR PALFREY
Measures have already been taken

MRS PALFREY
Backup team on call

MR PALFREY
(shakes his head)
Won’t be necessary

He graces a reassuring hand on her shoulder
MR PALFREY (CONT’D)
Relax hun It’s been fifteen years
without fault Fifteen flawless
years

He clinks his glass with her’s

MR PALFREY (CONTD)
Here’s to fifteen more

They share tender eye contact while--

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY WILDERNESS - NIGHT

Ava treks deeper into the night A stray eye on her evergreen
surroundings -- lifeless still and eerie

She continues to march onwards Gun draped over her shoulder

When the sound of an APPROACHING VEHICLE beckons her
attention behind her

Paired now with a blinding pair of HEADLIGHTS Brights on
shining like a ghastly spotlight

She turns around shielding her eyes from its glare Unable
to see the vehicle itself until it comes to a halt right next
to her revealing

A rust-burdened TOW TRUCK

Strong and sturdy in stature A front grill of intimidating
steel Its ENGINE bellowing a masculine ROAR

Avas eyes drift down to its passenger door reading “LEWIS and
SONS TOWING” in chipped black paint

She looks up into the dark interior of the vehicle The
drivers figure shrouded in shadow

DRIVER
(rough voice)
You look like you could use a ride

The sound of a CAR DOOR SLAMMING pre-laps --

INT TOW TRUCK RURAL HIGHWAY - SECONDS LATER

Now seated in the passenger seat Ava peers at the driver
his face still blanketed by darkness

The only light in its interior comes from the burning embers
of his cigarette and the neon glow of the radio

DRIVER
Where to hun

Avas eyes drift out the windshield

AVA
(distant)
Far far from here
The driver nods in the darkness understanding the sentiment
He gradually presses the accelerator the truck lurching
forward with a start

DRIVER
Mind if I play some music

AVA
Sure thing

His GLOVED HAND reaches into the radio’s neon light turning
up its volume

The voice of Carole King picking up with another round of
“Its Too Late”

While our blood curdles at its familiarity her lyrics
trigger something else in Ava’s memory

Something that RATTLES her to her very core--

INT BEDROOM THE LODGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Mrs Palfrey staring down at her lounging body
MRS PALFREY
--local mechanic- that good ol’
Lewis boy down on Old Wind Road
INT LOBBY THE LODGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Athena leans on the concierge’s desk
ATHENA
--some Lewis boy’1l have my car
back here tomorrow
EXT TOW TRUCK RURAL HIGHWAY - SECONDS BEFORE (FLASHBACK)

TIGHT on “LEWIS and SONS TOWING” painted on its door As we--

SMASH BACK INTO

INT TOW TRUCK - PRESENT

Ava peering back into the darkness at her driver A look of
terror growing on her face FINGERS slowly gripping the
hammer of her gun

As we PULL BACK through the vehicle’s rear window --

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Watching the truck make its way down the empty road as we
continue to DRIFT higher and higher up

Its blinding HEADLIGHTS peering deeper and deeper into the
darkness before it

The fates of its passengers hanging cruelly in the balance
As we finally gently

FADE to BLACK
