close enough to press thumbs together

JACK
Friends

But the aura of the quarrel is still there -- they
drop their hands and dont know what to do next
Jack looks over the sari tries for a grin

JACK
(continuing)

You know you do look pretty
sexy in that thing

Vicky grins then in a comical but sexy way she
hands him an end of the sari and they dance around
each other as he unwraps it while they hum some
torchy song Then they go into each others arms

They kiss begin to touch each other run their hands
over each other Jacks hand reaches Vickys buttocks

DR ROLLINS is a small compact woman Shes business-
like and yet gentle as

C

( )

cy)

DR ROLLINS
Over half the people in this
country weigh more than they
should And they spend 10
billion dollars every year on
fad diets gadgets pills
books clinics All they
really need is to eat fewer
calories

VICKY
But sometimes isnt it
something the body is doing
wrong

DR ROLLINS
Very very few cases are due to
body irregularity

VICKY
But my tests didnt they show
anything

DR ROLLINS

Your blood pressure is 130 over
95 it could be lower but its
normal Your sugar level is 120
100 is better but its normal
But if you gain more weight
those figures could change --
drastically

VICKY
What about my glands

DR ROLLINS
Sorry The only thing you can

blame is your fatty cells

VICKY
(a reprieve she
thinks)
Yeah

DR ROLLINS
Were all born with a certain
amount of fatty cells There
are two times in our lives when
they multiply If were fat as
toddlers or in our late teens

(

Cc)

c)

20
VICKY
(sinks)
Guilty
DR ROLLINS
Once theyre there they stay
there
She shows Vicky the chart -- two sketches of fatty
cells -- the sketch of the empty cells is small the

one with the filled cells is large but both contain
the same number of cells

DR ROLLINS
(continuing)
You see if you keep them empty
they stay small and you stay
slim But if you fill them up

She shrugs

VICKY
(really shaken now)
What can I do

DR ROLLINS
Take care of yourself

VICKY
Im too busy taking care of
everyone else

DR ROLLINS
(takes a diet sheet
from drawer the same
one Dr Haymer gave
Vicky)
You have time to go on a thousand
calorie diet And do aerobic
exercises -- jog swim bike
jump rope That will change
‘your metabolism and burn the
calories off faster But most
important Vicky Get at the
source Why

VICKY
(this is the nitty
gritty shes upset)
I dont know why

F

c)

c) 20

DR ROLLINS
Find out Im no psychologist
but I know people usually overeat
for emotional reasons Because
theyre unhappy or to make up
for something else theyre lacking

VICKY
Or maybe its just a vice like
drinking or drugs only it
shows more

DR ROLLINS

Then get rid of it Try a group
Weight Watchers or Overeaters
Anonymous or Calorie Counters

Vicky looks more and more overwhelmed

INT THE MATTHEWS DINING ROOM - DAY 21

She closes the door and leans on it thinking Then
she smiles accepts what shes done and likes it

searches in it
