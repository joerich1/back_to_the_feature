FRANK (V0O)
Thursday started out with a bang a
gunshot to the chest on a drug deal
gone bad Heat humidity moonlight--
all the elements in place for a long
weekend I was good at my job there
were periods when my hands moved
with a speed and skill beyond me and
my mind worked with a cool authority
I had never known But in the last
year I had started to lose that
control Things had turned bad I
hadnt saved anyone for months I
just needed a few slow nights a
week without tragedy followed by a
couple of days off

The radio continues Zebra 132 524 East 17--

LARRY
(on radio)
Were there

The ambulance breaks to a halt in front of a row of vintage
walk-ups Frank and Larry jump out Frank lugs the EKG monitor
and airway bag Larry the drug box yellow oxygen

pack slung over his shoulder Neighbors crowd around

OLD WOMAN
Which apartment Which apartment

FRANK
Move back Wheres the stairs 5A

OLD WOMAN
Oh Jesus its Mr Burke

The front door opens a young boy holding it

Authors note in emergency situations either on the street
or in the hospital it is assumed there is continual
background noise--voices sirens cries questions etc

CUT TO

INT TENEMENT STAIRWELL--NIGHT
Four flights up Frank and Larry climbing rotting steps
gray-yellow painted walls red doors with three locks each
Larry out of breath his stomach rolling around like a
bowling ball in a bag

CUT TO
INT BURKE APARTMENT--NIGHT

They enter 5A MRS BURKE 55 her eyes run dry standing in
the center of the room surrounded by neighbors Someone
leads them to the BEDROOM where Mr Burke 60 lies unmoving
stretched on the bed A young woman MARY BURKE 24 kneels
over the old man pressing her lips to his flaccid mouth

JOHN BURKE 30 grabs Franks arm

JOHN
We were just watching TV and Dad
yelled out and started punching his
chest next thing he locked himself
in the bathroom I said we were gonna
call you guys and he said not to
He was crying I never heard him
crying before then he sorta stopped
We pulled him out and put him on the
bed

Frank and Larry moving the body to the floor

FRANK
How long ago did he stop breathing

JOHN
Maybe ten minutes Woman on the phone
tried to tell us how to do CPR
Please you gotta do something

FRANK
Well do all we can

Larry ripping open Mr Burkes shirt prepping electrode
patches hooking wires Frank opening Burkes mouth feeling
a puff of gas escape Larry calling for backup Burkes EKG
rhythm on the monitor a flat green line

Franks training takes over he injects the long steel
laryngoscope down Burkes throat he finds a vein injects
epinephrine followed by atrophine followed by another epi
no response on the monitor Larry pulls out the paddles

FRANK (CONTD)
Clear Clear

Larry activates defibrillator shock--Burkes body heaves
Sweat drips from Larrys nose onto Burkes chest
MARY
No more please dont

They shock him again This time the body moves less Frank
glances up Mr and Mrs Burkes wedding photo sits on the
nightstand Other pictures a day at the beach a young
serviceman happy parents Franks mind drifts

FRANK (VO)
In the last year I had come to believe
in such things as spirits leaving
the body and not wanting to be put
back spirits angry at the awkward
places death had left them I
understood how crazy it was to think
this way but I was convinced if I
turned around Id see Old Man Burke
standing at the window watching
waiting for us to finish

Frank feels Burkes heart beneath cracked ribs The EEG
remains flat Hes dead Its time to quit

FRANK (CONTD)
(to Larry)
Ill take over Call ER and ask for
an eighty-three
(to Mrs Burke)
Sorry

Larry stands breathing heavy looks for a phone Frank turns
to notice relatives and neighbors standing around

FRANK (CONTD)
Do you have any music

MARY
What

FRANK
Music I think it helps if you play
something he liked

MARY
John play the Sinatra

John enters crying Mary repeats softly

MARY
Play the Sinatra

John exits Frank notices Mary for the first time blond
hair dyed black cut short loose fitting tank dress black
makeup running down her cheeks He notices her prom picture
glances back to Mary it seems she hasnt smiled since that
day eight years before Something special about her that
something that hits you right away
September of My Years plays from the other room Frank
continues massaging Mr Burkes chest (now to Sinatra beat)
even though its hopeless Larry returns

LARRY
Its OK Frank We can call it Eighty-
three

Frank feels something strange looks into Burkes pupils
checks his neck pulse wrist pulse His eyes go to Larry

FRANK
No we cant Hes got a pulse

LARRY
No shit

Larry checks the monitor the green line up and down Mary
senses a change in status

MARY
Is he going to be alright

FRANK
(not encouraging)
His hearts beating

A distant siren signals the arrival of backup Frank turns
to Larry

FRANK (CONTD)
Have ‘em bring up a stretcher

He looks from Mary back to Mr Burke--breathing but comatose
CUT TO
INT AMBULANCE--NIGHT

Larry climbing through the back doors sitting in the jumpseat
at the stretchers head as Frank hangs IV bags replugs EKG
wires that have come loose

Frank looks up sees Mary entering he takes her arm turns
her toward the rear doors

FRANK
Help your family Ride with your
mother and brother

Help yourself

Mary steps out stands in the red flashing light as Larry
closes the door Frank climbs in the drivers seat
CUT TO
EXT SECOND AVENUE--NIGHT

The EMS bus cruises up Second Frank checks the side mirror
John Mary and Mrs Burke pull behind in a black Ford Seeing
their faces Frank flips the lights and siren on Its too
late to help Mr Burke but its important to the family

that it look urgent Frank watches passing lights cars
faces

FRANK (VO)
I needed to concentrate because my
mind tended to wander on these short
trips It was the neighborhood I
grew up in and where I had worked
most as a paramedic and it held
more ghosts per square foot than any
other

CUT TO
EXT OUR LADY OF MERCY--NIGHT

Larry and Franks 13 Zebra ambulance lined up beside two
others outside a blazing Emergency sign on the crowded

with trauma violence and suffering it picks up the sobriquet
Knife and Gun Club On Manhattans Lower East Side its

our Lady Of Mercy aka Our Lady of Misery

ER a white-lit cement box painted yellow and decorated with
old framed Playbills Four rows of six plastic chairs face a
TV bolted and chained to the ceiling The seats are filled
with backed-up drunks assault victims and regulars
bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor
getting up to ask their status or going out to throw up and
have a smoke

Larry and Frank wheeling Burke in two IV lines each
connected to an elbow tangled in EKG cables Two LACERATED
RUSSIANS scramble out of their way as they approach GRISS
the large black sunglassed security guard He looks up from
his television guide

GRISS
Hey partner Your man does not look
well Theyre not gonna appreciate
you inside
(pumping Ambu-bag)
Griss let us in

GRISS
Things are backing up

Griss pushes a button activating the automatic door striking
the bandaged leg of a man lying down on a stretcher in the
hall Larry and Frank wheel Burke inside A pleading family
tries to follow Griss stretches out his hand

GRISS (CONTD)
You cant go in there folks

Mary John and Mrs Burke rush in from the street hoping
some miracle has occurred during the drive to the hospital
approach the sign-in desk

Frank and Larry pass four stretchers lined against the wall--
a passage nicknamed Skid Row leading past triage NURSE
CONSTANCEs station

NURSE CONSTANCE
Just keep moving Dont even slow
down

Nurse Constance turns back to the nervous man seated beside
her

NURSE CONSTANCE (CONTD)
Sir you say youve been snorting
cocaine for three days and now you
feel your heart is beating too fast
and you would like us to help you
To tell the truth I dont see why I
should If Im mistaken correct me
Did we sell you the cocaine Did we
push it up your nose

Larry and Frank slow at the last Skid Row stretchers On
one NOEL a young dark-skinned man with chaotic mess of
dreadlocks pulls feverishly at his restraints

NOEL
For Gods sake give me some water

From the next stretcher a man with feet swollen purple like
prize eggplants replies

BIG FEET
Shut up Goddamn civilians

NOEL
Give me some water

NURSE CRUPP stops Frank and Larry as they approach the
Critical care room inside the staff appears as if under
siege by a battalion of shriveled men and women lying on a
field of white sheets

NURSE CRUPP

diversion Cant accept any more
patients Your dispatcher should
have told you

FRANK

NURSE CRUPP

FRANK
He wanted to come here Said the
nurses at Misery were the best

NURSE CRUPP
(acquiesces)

Larry unravels himself from the IV lines as nurse walks over
takes Burkes pulse

NOEL
(to Frank)

not refuse a poor sick dying helpless
man a small cup of water

Back at SECURITY the Burkes confront Griss

GRISS

In CRITICAL CARE Larry wheels Burke into unit three as
Hazmat turns Frank to face the room explaining

As the staff crowds around Burke pulling the paddles from

untie Noel

NOEL

BIG FEET

Frank heads down Skid Row pushing the stretcher passing
Nurse Constance speaking with a man with a gash over his
eye

NURSE CONSTANCE
SO you get drunk every day and
you fall down Tell me why we should
help you when youre going to get
drunk tomorrow and fall down again

Frank pushes the automatic door button--and is suddenly hit
from behind by Noel The stretcher spins sideways Noel

dives out the doors for the water fountain snorting up water
like a bull Mary Burke standing with her family looks at
Frank

FRANK

a grateful Noel

FRANK

The doctor seems to think hes
suffering from some rare disorder

MARY
Its not so rare He grew up on our
street Hes had a rough life and
hes a little crazy from it but

someone a lousy cup of water

Mary starts to cry Frank fumbles in his pocket finds a
tissue gives it to her

drinking from a glass of whiskey looking across the gray
cityscape of high rises and water tanks winding down from
the nights work

FRANK (VO)

couldnt feel the earth Everything

I touched became light Horns played
in my shoes flowers fell from my
pockets

FRANK

Frank watches night tableaus (police cars flashing lovers
kissing woman crying hysterically drunken slugfest) as his

mind wanders

FRANK (VO)
The street is so much more
unpredictable than the ER and to
prepare for the unexpected I was
taught to act without thinking like
an army private who can take apart
and reassemble a gun blindfolded

Frank notices another EMS bus Tom Walls wheeling a stretcher--
Noel face bloodied lies restrained as Walls partner opens
the rear doors

FRANK (VO) (CONTD)
I realized that my training was useful
in less than ten percent of the calls
and saving someones life was rarer
than that As the years went by I
grew to understand that my role was
less about saving lives than about
bearing witness I was a grief mop
and much of my job was to remove if
even for a short time the grief
starter or the grief product It was
enough I simply showed up

Marcus continues as if uninterrupted

MARCUS
look at her Leaves you no idea
whats underneath not even a
suggestion Could be a skeleton for
all you know

They pass a working girl in a rain slicker who pulls off her
hood to look at them a familiar face

MARCUS (CONTD)
Nice though pulling back her hood
as we drive by Theres a mystery to
it then she shows you

FRANK
Shes no whore Marcus
