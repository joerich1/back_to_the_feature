wouldn’t consider wearing them

JULIE
It’s going to be a special night

Austin nods and kisses her romantically Sam sees Kayla
looking over and responds by grinding on Chad whos
surprised

SAM
So do you think you’re more of a
Gale or a Peeta to my Katniss

CHAD
I have no idea what you’re saying
right now

Sam keeps grinding but with a little less interest Kayla
tries to mimic Sam’s moves Dex is into it but is distracted
by the 50 YEAR OLD DJ who looks terminally bored

DEX
I wish I had my tables I would
totally battle DJ Fossil right
now I’m not feeling this guy’s
beats at all

Kayla grinds hard Dex takes notice

DEX (CONTD)
You are so slammin

Kayla raises a brow Dex looks at his palm and sees smudged
ink on it

DEX (CONTD)
-Something with a “K”

KAYLA
Kayla

DEX
Riiiiight

KAYLA

We don’t have to talk so much

Kayla smiles Dex nods appreciatively
EXT STREET - NIGHT

The guys continue driving to the prom Pete takes a hard

turn Eli slides across the back seat into Hunter Eli
shuffles back to his spot He looks at Hunter for a moment

ELI
Hey can you see any reason you can
see why Julie won’t give me the
time of day

HUNTER
Where should I start

ELI
I mean I know I’m not very macho
Id ask my dad but he left a while
back

Hunter feels bad He wasn’t expecting that response

Eli nods

HUNTER
Maybe I could give you some tips

ELI
You’d do that

HUNTER
Why not You kinda remind me of the
dorks I used to beat up in school

ELI
Cool I’m a romantic so I’m good
there But if it wasn’t for porn
Id know nothing about sex

HUNTER
Here’s something don’t try to kill
yourself in a girl’s house For
most of them complete turnoff

HUNTER (CONTD)
Maybe you just need to relax a bit
Be a kid cut loose Do something
unexpected Chicks like bad boys

ELI
Bad boys huh

Hunter nods Eli loosens his tie undoes his top button
turns to Hunter

and

HUNTER
Well baby steps

EXT COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

An elegant facility lit with stunning landscape lighting
Pete’s car flies like a bucking bronco over a speed bump

The car SCREECHES to a halt and the guys hurry to the door
LOUD HIP-HOP MUSIC PUMPS from inside

ELI
Sounds like it’s popping off

INT GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

The ballroom is ALMOST EMPTY - a handful of LESS ATTRACTIVE
PROM-GOERS and a pair of HANDSY CHAPERONES remain

The Chaperones make out while kids watch Some STRAGGLER KIDS
dance others including a BOY WITH HORRIBLE ACNE and a KID IN
A WHEELCHAIR sit alone at tables no doubt debating the
merits of suicide The guys meet at the front doors

PETE
Anything

MITCHELL
No all the bathrooms are empty

ELI
Shit

HUNTER
Wow Is this the prom for some kind
of special school

ELI
No we’re in the right place The
cool kids are gone The only people
left are the drama fags and the
regular fags

MITCHELL
(heartfelt)
Poor bastards where to next

PETE
Austin’s house

ELI
5721 Haverford Drive
PETE
That’s where the kids were going
after the prom

PETE
It gets better

The Boy With Horrible Acne gives Pete a thumbs up

EXT 11 - NIGHT
Seth talks with Austin Dex and Chad outside the limo

SETH
Hundred bucks should do it

DEX
(getting in Seth’s face)
For a case of Bud I’11 rip your
head off-

Austin puts out a hand calming Dex

AUSTIN
(pleading with Seth)
We’re in high school We don’t have
that kind of cash Come on Seth

SETH
Don’t “come on” me

The guys laugh Seth is embarrassed but brushes it off

SETH (CONTD)
Look I’ve got two strikes I could
get life for making this purchase
So if you want those Buds daddy’s
gonna need a hundy

Dex looks like he wants to strangle Seth

SETH (CONTD)
Do you wanna keep this party
rolling or not Because if not
maybe I should be dropping these
fine young ladies off at home

Austin Dex and Chad share a look then reach into their
wallets

INT CAR - LATER
The guys fly down a residential street

MITCHELL
Its a left here Pete
(as they pass the turn)
Left

PETE
Meadow Lane is faster

MITCHELL
No it’s slower with all of the
stop signs You just cost us five
minutes

ELI
Do you have any idea how many times
a teenage boy can ejaculate in five
minutes

Pete blows a stop sign and a SIREN wails

HUNTER
Nice work Pete

MITCHELL
I knew we shouldn’t have gone this
way Did I call it Did I

ELI
You called it

MITCHELL
Totally called it

Pete pulls over

MITCHELL (CONTD)
We’re drunk And we are totally

screwed

PETE
I’m not drunk I had a couple of
beers

HUNTER

Tell them you’ve had nothing Zero
beers Deny deny deny

PETE
I’m not gonna lie I’m fine

ELI

I have some gum Mr H
MITCHELL

I do too
PETE

I don’t need it

HUNTER
Act casually and breathe through
your noses

Mitchell grabs his and Eli’s gum and shoves it in Pete’s
mouth A young Hispanic cop OFFICER HERNANDEZ shines his
flashlight into the car and leans in

HERNANDEZ
Good evening gentlemen

Pete works hard to chew a GIANT WAD OF GUM

PETE
(mouth full)
Officer

The guys all nod hello Pete hands him his license and
registration Hernandez looks at the documents then into the
car and sees Mitchell and Eli conspicuously tight-lipped

HERNANDEZ
Have you gentlemen been drinking
tonight

PETE

(mouth still full)
I had a couple beers earlier But
as you can see I’m perfectly fine
now So if you don’t mind just
write me a ticket and we’ll be on
our way We’re in a hurry

HERNANDEZ
Oh is that right

Pete nods and continues chewing Hernandez looks at his fat
veteran partner OFFICER DONOHUE who shakes his head in
disgust Hernandez gives Pete a hard look

HERNANDEZ (CONTD)
Who’s the kid

PETE
Just a friend

ELI
It’s okay officer This isn’t a
Sandusky situation

That did not allay Hernandez’s concerns

HERNANDEZ
Sir I’m going to ask you to step
out of the car

PETE
Why

Hernandez stares at Pete for a moment and puts his hand on
his holster

HERNANDEZ
Because I fucking said so

Hernandez looks at Donohue who gives him a thumbs up Pete
looks at the guys worried He spits out the gum and gets out
of the car

EXT ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

Hunter Mitchell and Eli are all looking out the window of
the car as Pete is being given a Breathalyzer test

HERNANDEZ
Blow blow blow keep blowing

Hernandez looks at the test Pete blows a 06 below the
legal limit Donohue who has a snarling GERMAN SHEPHERD at
his side looks disappointed

PETE
(to the guys)
Point oh six

The guys celebrate in the car - high fives all around The
Cops don’t look pleased

PETE (CONTD)

Alright thank you officers
Sincerely You know I thought
about being a cop myself but then

words come out)
-got into college

Donohue turns to Hernandez They both look pissed

DONOHUE
Oh wow College boy huh Color us

PETE

No that came out wrong I just-

DONOHUE
You know I haven’t calibrated the
Breathalyzer recently We better

HERNANDEZ
Nah let’s just take him in Get a
blood test just to be safe

PETE
Let’s do the field sobriety test

DONOHUE
How about some running in place

HERNANDEZ

The Cops share a smirk Grizzly barks at Pete as he runs in
place
INT PETE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Mitchell Hunter and Eli sit in the car
HUNTER
What the fuck is going on out
there
REVEAL Pete doing squat thrusts
MITCHELL
We’re losing valuable time while
Pete’s blasting his quads
ELI
This is like a horror movie It’s

the Prom Night Hymen Massacre

Eli checks his cell phone then yells out the window

ELI (CONTD)
Not for nothing Mr Harrington
but Austin’s house has five
bedrooms I Zillowed it

ON PETE who shakes his head in frustration and stops the
squat thrusts

PETE
Alright guys I think we’re done
here I’m sober and pretty sweaty

Suddenly Donohue takes a defensive stance and quickly moves
his right hip away from Pete

DONOHUE
Whoa hey buddy Stay back

PETE
What

Pete hasn’t moved and looks confused

DONOHUE
(to Hernandez)
You see this guy just make a move
for my sidearm

HERNANDEZ
(catching on)
Oh yeah Totally saw that Your
sidearm He made a move

DONOHUE
College boy’s going to matriculate
downtown I’11 load Grizzly You
cuff his ass

Hernandez grabs Pete as Donohue walks the dog to the Cruiser
After a beat of hesitation Pete SHOVES HERNANDEZ TO THE
GROUND and sprints to his car

HERNANDEZ
We’ve got a runner

SCREECH Donohue turns to see that Pete has peeled out

DONOHUE
Holy fuck

Hernandez gets up He and Donohue look dazed not knowing how
to respond After a beat they hop in the Cruiser and take
off after the guys

INT PETE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
The guys are STUNNED as Pete flies down the road

MITCHELL
What the hell are you doing

PETE
We were going to be there all

find the girls

HUNTER
He’s right they were fucking with
him I’ve never done the running
man during a sobriety check

MITCHELL
They have your license We’re all
going to jail

PETE
I know but what choice did I have

Pete spots the Cruiser in his rear view lights flashing and
sirens blaring Pete cranks the wheel hard and turns

MITCHELL
Pull over Marcie’s never gonna let
me hang out with you guys again

ELI
If anyone survives tell Julie I
loved her and I will live in her
room when I’m a ghost

Pete makes another sharp turn

PETE
I’m not pulling over If any of you
want out I’1ll slow down and you
can jump

HUNTER
Then I don’t get to bang Debbie and
the dream dies Fuck that

Hunter starts pounding the ceiling of the car with his hand

ELI
Yeah keep hope alive

Eli starts banging the ceiling too Mitchell somewhat more
reluctantly joins in Pete makes a series of hard turns
then pulls into a random driveway and kills the lights

PETE
Get down

Everyone ducks in the car and a moment later the police
cruiser flies by down the street

INT POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER

The Cops look down each street as they drive by

HERNANDEZ
Goddammit

Donohue punches the steering wheel
DONOHUE
Where the fuck do they think

Donohue holds Pete’s driver’s license Hernandez shrugs
DONOHUE (CONT’D)
You know I expect stupid shit like

that from my son but those were
grown ass men

INT PETE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Pete and the guys sit up in the car

ELI
Wow

The guys laugh nervously surprised they’ve gotten away

and heads the other way

EXT AUSTIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

MITCHELL
I don’t hear a party going on

PETE

The guys hurry up to the house Eli runs to a bay window and

looks in

Pete Mitchell and Hunter run over and looks in Inside they
see a GUY in a tuxedo plowing a GIRL with a RED PROM DRESS

hiked up Her legs are in the air
PETE
Were too late

HUNTER

(to Mitchell)
Alright Julie’s cherry is busted

but Sam and Kayla could still be
intact
ELI
Wait Austin’s not balding
The MAN now leans back and the guys can see it’s not Austin
It’s RON 45 boning his WIFE

PETE
Oh thank god It’s just Austin’s

parents
Ron continues pumping until he makes a hideous o-face The

guys recoil in horror

MITCHELL
He was looking at me when he

finished

HUNTER
Shit you know what that means

his load is in your soul

Eli looks at Hunter are you serious Hunter shakes his head
nah Eli smiles and fist bumps Hunter Pete bangs on the door

and a winded Ron opens it

RON
Hey fellas What’s up

PETE
Where are the girls Ron

RON
Come in

The guys step inside Ron’s Wife covers herself Hunter nods
a hello at her She smiles shyly and quickly heads upstairs

RON (CONT’D)
Alright you got me Guilty as
charged The kids aren’t here

The guys are stunned

PETE
What the hell’s going on here

RON
Just a little prom night role play
Keeping the spark alive You guys
made it an exciting ending
(to Mitchell)
Especially you When we locked eyes
as I climaxed Intense right

Mitchell looks sick

HUNTER
That’s fucking gross Ron

PETE
Where are the girls

RON
Who wants a glass of pinot

Eli raises a hand

PETE
You lied about throwing a post-prom
party You called me to go over the
snack list to make sure it was okay
with Julie’s allergies

RON
Hey had to sell it right

PETE
You were so specific Teriyaki-
glazed beef jerky

RON
Look the kids just wanted to have
some harmless fun without parents

bother them okay

ELI
One of you guys is gonna hit him
right
HUNTER

here
PETE
(to Ron)

Pete shakes his head and turns to leave with the guys in tow

RON (CONT’D)
Pete hold up

Pete turns as the guys walk out

RON (CONTD)
What are you so worried about
Austin is a good kid You know
that And there is no way that
Austin is having sex with Julie
tonight

Long beat

RON (CONTD)
» without a condom I told him
how important it is to wear one

Pete heads for the door and spots something on the table
It’s a CONDOM Pete picks it up and shows Ron

RON (CONTD)
(remembering)
You know I did mention how much
better it feels without one That’s
my bad

Pete storms out

RON (CONTD)
(shouting)
There’s no disputing that

EXT LIMO - NIGHT

The limo is parked at the side of the busy highway Passing
cars HONK as the boys laugh while they piss on some bushes

INT LIMO - CONTINUOUS
Julie Kayla and Sam sip beer in the back of the limo

SAM
At first I didn’t like beer But
with each sip it gets less gross

She takes another big sip

SAM (CONTD)
(wincing)
So good

KAYLA
I can’t get enough of the stuff

She takes a long swig clearly hating it Sam takes a long
chug Kayla matches it

SAM
Want some Julie It’s the best
thing I’ve ever tasted

JULIE
No beer tastes awful

KAYLA
Totally wrong

Sam nods They each swig again

SAM
I can’t wait to get with Chad I’m

KAYLA

trying to saw it off

Julie shakes her head disgusted
INT PETE’S CAR - NIGHT
Pete drives into town no one saying a word
HUNTER

What’s the plan Pete We can’t
just drive around aimlessly all

night

ELI
Should we check the hospitals and
morgues

MITCHELL

Oh my god they could be dead

PETE
They’re not dead

ELI
Youre right I’m sorry

Mitchell takes a deep breath

ELI (CONTD)

Can we make a quick stop at Mickey
Dees I think the fumes are
affecting me

PETE
We’re on a mission here Eli We
don’t have time-

HUNTER
Just hit the drive-through Pete
We have no plan and the kid needs
sugar

Pete sighs and turns into the McDonald’s drive-through

ELI
We’re all frustrated Let’s just
crush a McFlurry and get our heads
right

HUNTER
What’s that

ELI
It’s vanilla ice cream mixed with
Oreos Julie turned me onto them
They’re terrific

HUNTER
(to Eli)
Order me up one of those bad boys
too Extra large playa

Eli nods Fist bump then Eli zips his window down

ELI
Do you want me to ask if they’re
hiring Mr Forde

MITCHELL
Fuck you very much Eli

HUNTER
He’s only trying to help

MITCHELL
Youre right Sorry Eli Ask if
they offer dental

Eli nods

MCDONALDS EMPLOYEE (0S)
Welcome to McDonald’s Can I take
your order

ELI
Yes thanks We’d like-

Through the glass Pete spots Julie hanging out of the limo
at the drive-through pick-up window

PETE
Holy shit it’s Julie There they
are

The guys see Julie grabbing the food (including a McFlurry)
and disappearing back into the limo

ELI
Told you she loves the McFlurry

MITCHELL
Get over there Pete

Pete nails the gas then slams the brakes -- there’s a car
two feet in front of them He puts it in reverse but there’s
a car right behind them There’s nowhere to go

PETE
We’re trapped

The girls’ limo leaves the McDonald’s

MITCHELL
They’re getting away

ELI
Austin will probably use the
McFlurry to stimulate her nipples

Hunter nods definitely Pete fumes and turns the wheel hard

PETE
Hang on

He punches the gas and the car climbs up the curb and tears
into the bushes lining the drive-through

ELI
Fuck yeah Mr H

Bush debris flies all over the crowded parking lot and
CUSTOMERS dive out of the way of the car Finally free of the
line Pete fishtails onto the road

MITCHELL
They were headed toward Atlantic

Pete makes another sharp turn Mitchell spots the limo

MITCHELL (CONTD)
There That’s them

Pete floors it The shitty car shakes like a bastard as he
weaves in and out of traffic

ELI
(re the car)
Christ this thing’s a pile of
shit Time for a new car dude

MITCHELL
(sensitively)
You do spend an awful lot of time
repairing it

PETE
This was Jessica’s car

HUNTER
We know man We understand

Pete nods

HUNTER (CONT’D)
But you’ve gotta move on If you
worked that widower angle properly
you could be blowing your bag all
over town

PETE
Can we discuss this later

Pete finally catches up to the limo Its windows are tinted
completely black The guys can’t see in

PETE (CONTD)
You’re sure that’s them

MITCHELL
I’m positive I remember the
license plate

HUNTER
Pull up next to it

Pete pulls up beside the limo Hunter yells out the window

HUNTER (CONTD)
Pull the fucking limo over NOW

Pete honks the horn The limo accelerates

HUNTER (CONTD)
What’s this driver doing

PETE
I had a bad feeling about him when
he fleeced me for an extra ten
bucks

MITCHELL
He took me for fifty

HUNTER
You fell for that shit

The limo cranks a hard turn desperate to lose the guys

PETE
What the hell

ELI
He’s taking evasive maneuvers

Pete follows gaining on the limo The limo suddenly takes an
impossible right turn but can’t make it

It clips the curb at a high rate of speed and flips on its
side scraping along the street shooting sparks for 50
feet

The limo heads toward a BOWLING ALLEY where a sign
displaying TEN BOWLING PINS sit atop two posts The limo

slides between the posts taking out eight of the pins but
leaving the dreaded 7-10 split

The guys look on in HORROR

PETE
JULIE

Mitchell is frozen in the car Pete Eli and Hunter hop out
and race to the limo

PETE (CONTD)
Please be okay

Pete and Hunter climb up the car and reach the door which is
badly dented They struggle to open the door Finally a
BRIDE and GROOM pop out of the sunroof
PETE (CONTD)
It’s okay It’s not the girls It’s
just some newlyweds
IN PETE’S CAR
Mitchell exhales relieved
AT THE LIMO
The guys help the couple out
PETE (CONTD)
(to the couple)

Congratulations

ELI
Great dress

ON HUNTER
- who helps the Limo Driver out
HUNTER
(to the Limo Driver)

Why didn’t you just pull over
man

LIMO DRIVER
Would you pull over when a bunch of
aggro assholes in a hoopdie are
screaming and waving at you

Hunter nods good point He hurries back to Pete and Eli who
talk to the couple but are backing up toward Pete’s car

HUNTER
Let’s roll

GROOM
(to Pete and Eli)
Some bumps and bruises but we’re
okay God must have been looking
over us because-

PETE
We get the idea Sorry

The guys hustle into the car and SCREECH they take off The
couple eats exhaust

BRIDE
Do you think your mother had
something to do with this

GROOM
Don’t be ridiculous

The Bride looks unconvinced

EXT STREET - NIGHT

At the scene of the limo a few POLICEMEN and PARAMEDICS
surround the area The Cops look at the totaled limo

HERNANDEZ
Lucky they walked away from this
one

DONOHUE

Yeah they’ve got a big night of
boning ahead of them

Hernandez nods excitedly Donohue turns serious

DONOHUE (CONTD)
That’s off the record

HERNANDEZ
Of course
DONOHUE
Did you catch the description
Sounds like our skells

HERNANDEZ
Yeah exactly

DONOHUE
You believe the size of the scrotes
on these guys

HERNANDEZ

Felony evading reckless driving

Gigantic scrotes

DONOHUE

HERNANDEZ

Itd be nice not to have to pick up
dog shit at work

Donohue nods They climb back into their cruiser

EXT GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Pete gasses up the car The guys stand around

HUNTER
(glaring at Mitchell)
“Definitely their limo”

MITCHELL
There was definitely a six in the
license plate

PETE
This really sucks

MITCHELL
Hey at least your girls are with
decent kids Kayla’s date has VD
written all over him

HUNTER
Yeah I wouldn’t be surprised if
that kid has the hiv

MITCHELL
Oh my god you’re right I didn’t
even think of that

(MORE)

MITCHELL (CONTD)
Kayla’s gonna get AIDS And not
Magic Johnson AIDS The bad kind

ELI
Hey I have an idea

Eli whips out his phone and goes online He navigates to
SILVER BACK’S home page

ELI (CONTD)
Check it out

CLOSE ON the web page Two HUGE GORILLAS growl angrily at
each other then one mounts the other and they bang
aggressively to a techno track

HUNTER
That’s disturbing

MITCHELL
Why would you show us that I am
not into it

ELI
No look The girls aren’t
answering their cells right
He points to the bottom of the page which reads “To book
call Silver Back’s cell directly” The guys exchange looks
then Mitchell quickly dials

MITCHELL
It’s ringing

PETE
Put it on speaker

Mitchell hits the speaker button

The guys can’t believe it Eli turns to Pete and Hunter
ELI
One of you guys is gonna hit him
right
INT PETE’S CAR - LATER

Pete drives around aimlessly Everyone is silent worried

ELI
(to Hunter)
I had a beautiful evening planned
for Julie’s first time

PETE
Here we go

ELI
There’s a cozy little inn at the
end of Dune Road in Montauk It’s
off the beaten path beyond the
glitz and shallowness of the
Hamptons It’s nearly a hundred
years old It has a wrap-around
porch overlooking the Atlantic
Julie and I would stay there on the
night we agreed that our love for
one another was eternal We’d walk
along the beach after a romantic
dinner then back in our room I’d
light a dozen candles and que up
Michael Buble’s “Come Fly With Me” -
- disc one of course

HUNTER
Gotta go disc one

ELI
Then wed kiss passionately for a
while as we bathed in the claw-foot
tub then climb into bed and once
again proclaim our love only this
time allowing our genitals to do
the talking

PETE
More than enough Thank you Eli

ELI
Indulge me Mr H The fantasy is
all that remains Following a few
hours of love-making we’d sit out
on the balcony overlooking the
lighthouse Julie would rehydrate
with a Gatorade as I massaged her
feet We’d sit there in silence
content and listen to the waves
crashing on the beach And perhaps
should it be the right time of
year wed be serenaded by the
migrating whales singing not far
off shore
MITCHELL
That sounds nice

HUNTER
It really does

Eli nods and wipes away a tear

ELI
A little later round two Maybe
reverse cowgirl That looks fun

HUNTER
It’s fantastic

PETE
Look Eli we’re running out of
time You know how these kids
think Where could they be

ELI
I wouldn’t know I’m not cool

HUNTER
Don’t sell yourself short You’ve
got potential And you’re our best
shot at finding them

Eli thinks about it

ELI
Maybe Tina would know

HUNTER
(of course)
Tina right
(then)
Who’s Tina

PETE
Seriously Hunter She was one of
Julie’s and Sam’s best friends

Hunter shrugs

PETE (CONTD)
She’s a really nice girl They were
always together until
(glancing at Mitchell)
« recently

MITCHELL
What
Eli nods

PETE
Nothing It’s just that she used to
come around a lot more I got the
idea that Kayla didn’t like Tina
anymore then I noticed that Tina
stopped coming around

MITCHELL
So

PETE
So I think Kayla’s a bad
influence

MITCHELL
Kayla is

PETE
Yeah don’t look so surprised I
mean I’m sure this pact was all
her idea

MITCHELL
Kayla’s idea How the hell would
you know that They all signed it

PETE
It was Kayla’s handwriting And you
saw what she was wearing tonight

MITCHELL
What’s wrong with her dress

PETE
Dress I thought it was a belt

HUNTER
He’s got a point Mitchell Kayla
seems way more sexually advanced
than Julie or Sam

MITCHELL
Oh right like Sam wouldn’t know
anything about sex You should have
a turnstile on your bedroom door

HUNTER
Hate the game bro

MITCHELL
I’1l have you know that Kayla was a
girl scout

PETE
She was a girl scout so she
couldn’t be promiscuous

MITCHELL
Well she’s a virgin isn’t she

PETE
I know That’s the most shocking
part of this whole fucking night

Mitchell shoots a death glare at Pete

HUNTER
(to Eli)
Girl scouts are usually pretty
easy I finger blasted so many girl
scouts when I was a kid that my
pinky still smells like thin mints

Eli’s jaw drops

MITCHELL
Just drive Pete

INT LIMO - NIGHT

Austin makes out with Julie Sam a bit tipsy looks over at
Kayla then rubs Chad’s thigh Chad’s eyes among other
things grow huge He laughs nervously

Kayla also tipsy leans over and rubs Dex’s leg He slides
forward which moves her hand on his crotch She quickly
removes her hand and he laughs

EXT TINA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is dark Not a single light is on Pete’s car pulls
up in front of the house

MITCHELL
Looks like they’re asleep

PETE

MITCHELL
Fuck off Pete

Before the guys can get out of the car Eli is out and
climbing a tree in the front yard Pete gets out and hurries
over to him

EXT TINA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Pete looks up at Eli

PETE

HUNTER
Too bad he won’t do anything about

ELI

What should he do

HUNTER
She’s throwing off serious signals
Now’s the time to break the spacial
barrier Touch her Gently but in
a firm way Something that says
“Tm here for you I care deeply
My cock is here with us too”

ELI
He’s not doing any of that

HUNTER
No there’s no room in his life for
anyone but Julie

ON PETE AND MAYA as the other guys and the other Undercover

PETE
I’d really like-

UNDERCOVER COP
Apologies for the beat down but
this area is full of scumbags just
waiting to get their filthy hands
on young naive girls so they can
get them hooked on drugs and turn
‘em out Next thing you know these
poor girls are so strung out on
crank they can’t keep track of
which veins still work or whose

MITCHELL
Eli some guys will have sex with
any woman who comes along Others

Mitchell offers no rebuttal

I’m sorry I found the pact guys I
shouldn’t have been snooping in
Julie’s room in the first place

PETE
None of this is your fault Eli
This is on us Tonight is about our
failings as fathers

MITCHELL
Yeah Kayla’s acting out because
she’s embarrassed of me She
probably did instigate this whole
thing

PETE
No Mitchell I’m sorry about
saying that

MITCHELL
No it’s probably true I want my
kids to respect me but I can’t
even find a job I’m not worthy of
their respect

HUNTER
Well I didn’t even know Sam was
being excluded I’m so wrapped up
in my own shit that I had no idea
about the pain she must be feeling
I don’t know anything about her

Hunter is choked up The guys look at him - they’ve never
seen him like this

HUNTER (CONTD)
The truth is I’m terrified of her
I expected to have a boy What do I
have in common with a 15 year old
girl So I just I don’t even
try I’m a terrible father

Pete puts his arm on Hunter’s shoulder

PETE
There’s plenty of blame to go
around When I lost Jessica I
tried so hard to be Julie’s friend
that I smothered her She was
desperate to prove her
independence I drove her to this

Beat Eli realizes he’s the only one kicking

around Eli

SETH
Oh right I’d love to help you out

(rubbing fingers together
looking for a bribe)
You understand

MITCHELL
I gave you fifty bucks earlier
tonight

SETH

I’m back to funerals until next
summer man Do you have any idea
how poorly grieving people take
hints

Out of cash the guys look defeated Suddenly a fist
connects with Seth’s jaw knocking him down The guys look
over at Eli who rubs his hand

HUNTER
Nice

ELI
I knew none of you would hit him

PETE
(to Seth)
Where are they

SETH
(struggles to get it out)
