THE UTAH MURDER PROJECT

SUPERIMPOSE
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

In total darkness we hear the almost deafening sounds of a
HEART SLOWLY BEATING The loud sound is up close and in our
ears It continues as we slowly --

FADE IN

ECU OF A HAND GRIPPING A 45 CALIBER AUTOMATIC The heart
beating continues as we TILT UP to reveal the face of
undercover narcotics detective CHARLIE DESANTIS (30s) He is
unkempt with wild long hair goatee and beard

The gruff and scruffy cop is leaning his back against a car
door hiding He is nervous and shaking -- panting and
sweating like a thirsty animal Obviously scared for his
life

In the bg we barely make out the sounds of RANDOM GUNSHOTS
ECHOING THROUGH THE AIR With each shot DeSantis flinches
just a bit These gunshots are faint though Dimmed out by
the deep pulsating sound of the detective’s HEART BEAT

EXT STREET CURB - EAST LOS ANGELES - DAY (SLOW MOTION
SEQUENCE )

Hiding next to DeSantis is his partner JEFF SPEARS (30s) --
scruffy and unkempt Spears looks to have had a few more
years on the force In his eyes we see that he is also
visibly frightened

The two men are undercover and have just closed in on a
suspect It appears that a deal has just gone bad Very
bad The constant barrage of gunfire SHATTERS THE WINDOWS OF
THE PARKED CAR Shards of glass attack the two men as they
cover themselves from harm

JEFP

In a slow and steady movementthe detective stands and
rests his hands on the roof of the unmarked squad car --
aiming his weapon down the street and in the direction of
their suspect RAMON VASQUEZ (30s) also hiding safely behind a
row of parked cars

VASQUEZ

instantly returning the cops fire with shots from a large
automatic machine gun Like an uzi only more high-tech and
deadly

JEFF

quickly ducks down dodging the gunfire and hitting the
ground with his partner

DESANTIS

continues to sit in a state of shock unable to move due to a
gunshot wound to the leg He peeks from the corner of his
eye and turns his head slightly --

HIS POV

He notices a young boy trapped under his bicycle He is
crying and covering his ears -- muffling the deafening
gunfire

BACK TO SCENE

DESANTIS

wants desperately to help the child but cannot move

JEFF

turns and notices his partner’s catatonia He abruptly grabs
him by the collar and mouths the words “Get the boy”

DESANTIS

simply cannot move an inch

JEFF

recklessly runs into the line of fire to cover the young
child He instantly catches some stray fire in the back and
falls wounded As he struggles to get up he manages to
pull the boy from his bicycle -- almost out of harm’s way
Unfortunately the detective cannot dodge the constant blaze
of sporadic gunfire

DESANTIS

watches as his partner is hit with several more shots as he
and the boy struggle to take cover behind the vehicle

(23

JEFF
falls to the ground dying
THE BOY

lay still on the ground frozen and unable to move

DESANTIS

desperately reaches out to the boy -- who is crying heavily
THE BOY

reaches his arm to DeSantis -- who successfully pulls him

from the line of fire
DESANTIS

holds the scared child in his arms as BULLETS CONTINUE TO
SPRAY THE VEHICLE they’re hiding behind The detective turns
and notices --

JEFF

desperately reaching his hand out to him begging for help
He is blood-soaked dying He mouths the words “Help me”
Before DeSantis can react we quickly

cuT TO

INT DESANTIS’ HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

DESANTIS jumping up and awaking from the nightmare He is
completely drenched in sweat and cannot catch his breath He
slowly manages to compose himself The detective is a very
different looking man than in his dream Short hair no
beard Just some five o’clock shadow

He lays on a beaten old couch in the middle of his living
room The coffee table before him is completely covered with
EMPTY LIQUOR AND BEER BOTTLES Not five or six but forty or
fifty bottles The floor surrounding him is also covered
with empty bottles and other trash

DeSantis calms himself -- looks down at his pants and notices
that he’s urinated A few moments pass before he stands and
continues toward the bathroom to get cleaned up As he
passes through the filthy home he kicks and muddles his way
through the trash and debris
INT BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS

DeSantis enters and flicks on the light Without hesitation
he removes his pants and tosses the urine scaked sweat pants
into the bathtub -- which is filled with ten or more other
pairs of urine stained sweats and boxers We stay on the
bathtub a few moments taking it all in This is a sad
deeply haunted and disturbed man

CUT TO

EXT MOTEL - DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A small dusty motel in the middle of nowhere A NEON
VACANCY SIGN FLICKERS on and off A total of three cars sit
parked in the dusty lot The night is suspiciously quiet
with only a slight wind in the air

SUPERIMPOSE

BRYERSON UTAH
APRIL 13 2004
1149 PM

The long stretch of road in front of the motel is empty It
seems to stretch into eternity with no sign of a vehicle in
sight ThensuddenlyTWO BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS are seen in
the distance A CAR coming up the road

The LIGHTS become BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER as the car draws
nearer As it becomes visible we see that it’s a Grey DODGE
PICK-UP with a DIRT BIKE mounted in the cab The truck draws
nearer to the motel turns into the barren lot

EXT MOTEL — CONTINUOUS

The truck parks in an empty spot From the truck steps an
unseen MAN from the waist down We’ll call him “The
Cowboy” Dressed in typical cowboy apparel Blue jeans
boots He steps to the rear of the vehicle and pulls a long
AREA RUG from the truck’s cab He begins toward the room

INT MOTEL ROOM
The cowboy enters leaving the door wide open We see a pair

of HANDS in RUBBER GLOVES as he unrolls the rug in front of
the bathroom door

SERIES OF SHOTS

A PINK BLOUSE and pair of BLUE JEANS lay on the un-made bed
The man grabs the clothing and stuffs it into a large garbage
bag

A PICTURE appears to be missing on the motel room wall
There is a hook where a picture used to hang We TILT DOWN
to reveal several shards of BROKEN GLASS AND A SHATTERED
PICTURE AND FRAME on the carpet

SuddenlyA HAND reaches down and grabs the picture from the
floor He tosses the broken picture frame into the garbage
bag

BATHROOM

The cowboy grabs the white shower curtain and pulls it from
its rings As the shower curtain is removed we are shocked
to see A BLOODY HANDPRINT on the shower wall The print is
small and delicate The print of a young woman We then
quickly

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT MEN’S LOCKER ROOM - LAPD - DAY

DeSantis opens up his locker and packs a few personal
belongings into a small gym bag This includes a nickel-
plated 22 CALIBER HANDGUN His backup weapon Taped to the
inside of his locker door is a PHOTO of a young woman (20s) --
blonde and beautiful DeSantis spots the photo out of the
corner of his eye He takes a moment and gazes at the young
woman He peels it from the locker door and tosses it into
his bag

INT OFFICE OF CAPTAIN EDDIE GRUBER - NARCOTICS DIVISION
CAPT GRUBER POV

From behind his desk We stay on the front door as we notice
DESANTIS approaching it from the other side

We hear the VOICE OF CAPTAIN GRUBER on the telephone as
DeSantis peers through the glass

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S)
Yeah I just got off the phone
with IA five minutes ago and got an
earful

DeSantis gives a quick knock before entering

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S)
I got trouble knocking on my door
right now 1I’11 call you later

DeSantis shuts the door behind him and stands respectively
with his hands crossed and rested on his lap We hear
Captain Gruber HANGING UP A PHONE

CAPTAIN GRUBER I hear you’ve officially requested
a stress leave Ninety days

DESANTIS
That’s right

The sound of Captain Gruber shifting in his chair sighing
uncomfortably

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S)
Well that’s pretty damn irregular
considering the present
circumstances don’t you think
DeSantis

The detective doesn’t respond His eyes remain locked on the
Captain He doesn’t even blink

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S
Put yourself in my shoes Charlie
It’s only been two weeks since IA
cleared you on assault charges and
now you’re asking for a three month
leave

DESANTIS
I know how it must look

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S)
Good Cos it looks real fuckin’
bad I went to bat for you with
Internal Affairs to convince them
you weren’t losing it

(MORE)

Pay
hod

CAPTAIN GRUBER (contd)

Now you’re going on a psycho leave
and giving them every excuse to re-
open the investigation

DESANTIS
I need to figure some things out
About this place About where I
stand

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S)
So you’re thinking about a
transfer

DESANTIS
Like I saidI need some time
That’s all I can really tell you
right now

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S)
All right You listen and listen
good

We slowly close on DeSantis’ face

CAPTAIN GRUBER (0S)
As far as I’m concerned if you
wanna run off for three months and
ruin your record that’s fine with
me But let me make one thing
erystal clear to you I don’t want
you in this building I don’t want
to see you I don’t wanna hear
about you harassing Vasquez The
best advice I can give youget
the hell as far away from here as
possible Cos Internal Affairs
will be watching and so will I

A slight grin on DeSantis as the Captain approves his three
month leave

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY —- UTAH — DUSK

cuT TO

The camera travels quickly down a two lane desert road An
ORANGE SUN AND SKY illuminate the RED DESERT TERRAIN It’s

beautiful

Nothing bad could ever happen here
INT DESANTIS’ CAR

The detective cruises down the long desert highways of Utah
He passes the time by anxiously flipping through the channels
on his stereo -- not picking up much

EXT DOWNTOWN BRYERSON - DAY

DeSantis slowly passes through the downtown avenues of
Bryerson Utah Population 3459 It’s an old fashioned
burg that hasn’t seen a touch of remodeling since the
Eisenhower years

The streets consist mostly of small family owned businesses
and shops An old movie palace five and dime stores An
ice cream parlor etc It’s very quaint in a dull and dreary
kind of way

INT DESANTIS’ CAR

He peeks out his window and spots the Sheriff’s office in the
hear distance He slows to a halt approaching the front
door of the office A SIGN ON THE WINDOW reads “Closed for
Sunday dinner”

DeSantis grins at the sign -- shaking his head in amusement
He continues down the street headed for Sunday dinner

EXT HOME OF SHERIFF DAN PATTERSON

DeSantis pulls up to the front of the home A real down home
southern cottage with a giant front yard and picket fence
Children are running about the yard playing tag wresting
rough-housing

The detective attempts to park but there are cars up and down
both sides of the street -- as far as the eye can see

DeSantis stares in amusement at the very basic innocence of
this town

DESANTIS
Can Opey come out and play
EXT BACKYARD

The backyard is where the party is A barbecue is going
Music is playing And rows of townspeople sit at picnic
tables eating socializing Enjoying the simple life It’s
a regular Sunday afternoon event for the people of Bryerson

DeSantis and SHERIFF DAN PATTERSON (50s) stone faced and
rugged -- sit at a corner table away from most of the crowd
Also sitting with them is DEPUTY BILLY BRACKEN (20s) a short
and thin but fierce looking young man with a menacing stare
and something to prove DeSantis hands The Sheriff a manila
folder

DESANTIS
This is a missing person’s report
filed by The Gold’s in November of
1996 After week four and no
contact was made Darcy was
presumed dead A little under two
weeks latershe shows up back at
home

The Sheriff turns his attention from the paperwork to
DeSantis He squints in confusion

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
Turns out she was staying with a
girlfriend and her brother at his
place Some secluded cabin in the
woods 40 miles up state At the
time of her disappearance her
parents were in the middle of an
ugly divorce Darcy admitted to me
that she used this as a ploy to
keep her parents together

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Why didn’t the Golds mention any of
this before

DESANTIS
They probably don’t want the past
drudged up any more than I do
Being that Mr and Mrs Gold were
still contract players for NBC the
whole incident became a huge media
case Sheriff what I’m asking is
this I was hopingfor nowwe
could keep this incident quiet

The Sheriff stares over at Deputy Bracken who watches with
equal suspicion

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
You know if word of this leaks
your town is flooded with
reporters If her kidnapper is
continuing to make contact with
you odds are he’s still here I
think a media presence would only
scare this guy off But I know you
already know that Sheriff
Otherwise you would’ve called the
state police and FBI the moment
Darcy was picked up

The Sheriff cracks a smile -- SMIRKS at the young detective
He’s blown away by his up front in-your-face directness
DeSantis is a force to be reckoned with Whether the Sheriff
likes it or not

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Anything else Detective

Deputy Bracken lets out a SMIRK as he devours another slice
of the pie

DeSantis pays the Deputy no mind and stays focused on the
Sheriff’s eyes

DESANTIS
I‘d like permission to stick
around Review your case files
Talk to any witnesses you may have
questioned You have a sketch of
this man I’‘d like to help show
his picture around See if we can
pinpoint who this man is I’d like
to make myself useful Sheriff

Sheriff Patterson sighs in frustration He sits staring at
DeSantis with uncertainty
EXT SIDEWALK

Sheriff Patterson and DeSantis take a stroll down a sidewalk
in front of his home Children are still running about

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Since your friend disappeared I’ve
been flooded with phone calls
(MORE)

ll

SHERIFF PATTERSON (contd)
People are coming in off the street
asking questions about a kidnapping
I don’t have any answers to Like
you said the only good lead we
have is the fact this man’s
maintained contact Until we get
something better I don’t wanna
draw any more attention than I have
to

DESANTIS
I understand

SHERIFF PATTERSON
That includes flashing an LA badge
and making everyone even more
nervous Next thing you knowthe
whole town’s calling Asking
questions Wanting to know if
there’s some crazy bastard out
there abducting girls Darcy’s
friends The Golds they don’t
wanna believe she’s gone

Sheriff Patterson stops in his tracks -- faces DeSantis

SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
Maybe they think you’1ll tell them
something different Something
they’d rather hear You say you
wanna help

DESANTIS
Whatever I can

SHERIFF PATTERSON
You keep them calm and out of my
hair so me and my men can do our
jobs

INT CASEY AND LEANNE’S MOTEL ROOM

At a corner table DeSantis sits across from CASEY BRENNER
(20s) dark hair as beautiful as Darcy

Sitting on the edge of a nearby bed is Darcy’s other friend
LEANNE BOWMAN (20s) red hair cute

Sheriff Patterson leans his back comfortably against the

wall listening in on the conversation He remains silent
and passive despite his obvious disgust with DeSantis

CASEY
He called twice Yesterday and
today

DESANTIS
At what time did you get the first
call

CASEY

Real early I’d say around five in

the morning or so Maybe Five
thirty

DESANTIS
What did he have to say

CASEY
He just wanted to let us know what
a great time he and Darcy were
having Then he said whatever you
do don’t leave your room for the

next few days Either him or Darcy

would be calling back

DESANTIS
Did you ask to speak with Darcy

CASEY
He said she couldn’t come to the
phone She was in the shower
Getting cleaned up from their long
hot night He was disgusting

DESANTIS
And what about this second call

CASEY
He didn’t call again until
todaya little bit after two
o’clock This time Sheriff
Patterson was here

DeSantis notices Sheriff Patterson leaning on the wall The

two men exchange stares

CASEY (CONTD)
He didn’t say anything about Darcy
He just asked if I spoke with the
police He said he had a message
for them

ay
oi

DESANTIS
A message

CASEY
When I told him The Sheriff was
here and wanted to talk he hung
up- I guess he panicked That’s
when I called you Darcy said to
call you if I ever needed help

DESANTIS
You did good Casey
(to Sheriff)
Sheriff You think I could have a
few minutes with the girls

Sheriff Patterson gives DeSantis an angry stare but
maintains his cool composure

SHERIFF PATTERSON
I’m gonna check on The Golds

He continues out

Leanne visibly grows suspicious of the detective’s

DESANTIS
Casey -- when we spoke the other
day you mentioned that Darcy was
drinking a lot the night she
disappeared

CASEY
Yes she was We all were So
what

DESANTIS
Do you know if Darcy’s been in any
kind of trouble lately Like with
her drugs Has she been depressed
at all

questioning As does Casey

CASEY
What‘re you saying

DESANTIS
Before The Sheriff and I can
continue any further we need to
establish Darcy’s mind set at the
time of her abduction

33

Casey seems to be growing impatient with the detective’s line
of questioning

LEANNE
What the hell does her mood have to
do with anything She was picked
up in broad daylight in front of
two witnesses What’s your
problem

DESANTIS
I know you’re both scared of the
publicity Darcy would get if this
thing went public We all know
this isn’t the first time she’s
disappeared

LEANNE
That’s bullshit That was eight
years ago She was just a kid I
can’t even believe you’re bringing
that up now
(to Casey)
Please tell him he’s crazy

Casey is awkwardly silent -- refusing to take sides with
Leanne She’s already contemplated this

LEANNE (CONT’D)
Casey

Leanne awaits an answer and doesn’t get one She sits ina
state of total dismay and utter disgust folding her arms and
looking away in protest

DESANTIS
She jumped in a strange car
although the two of you strongly
advised against it When the Feds
get wind of this they’re gonna
find this behavior a little
suspicious Especially with her
history of running away

Leanne sighs completely disgusted She buries her face
unable to even look at the detective

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
The reality is if we can’t get her
back soon this will go public
That means FBI A statewide APB
(MORE)

4
DESANTIS (CONT D)
Her face all over the news and on
every paper and tabloid that can’t
wait to use this incident to dig up
her past and use it against her

LEANNE
But she didn’t run away She was
kidnapped

DESANTIS
I know she was But in order for
me to find out exactly what
happened to Darcy I’m gonna need
all the facts I need to know if
she was back on her pills If she
was drinking again If she was
having problems at work or with her
love life Anything and
everything

CUT TO

EXT SIDEWALK - RESIDENTIAL STREET - MORNING

It is a typical beautiful sunny day in California as DARCY
GOLD (20s) blonde hair drop dead gorgeous jogs down a
sidewalk in her quiet up scale neighborhood She moves with
the grace and confidence of a born star

SUPERIMPOSE

SANTA MONICA CA
TWO WEEKS AGO

Darcy finishes her jog and continues into her apartment
building

INT DARCY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Darcy enters and continues into the kitchen She grabs a
bottled water from the refrigerator and begins chugging it
down like a mad woman

MINUTES LATER

Darcy is sprawled out on the living room floor stretching
her legs out after a long hard jog She is in a full split
The PHONE RINGS behind her Darcey attempts to grab the phone
from the table but her hand cannot reach She quickly sits
up answers

DARCY
Hello

INT OFFICE OF ALICIA NEWMAN - KBS STUDIOS

Darcy sits across from her boss ALICIA NEWMAN (50s) a very

attractive but somewhat frigid woman

She is the creator and

executive producer of “Beverly Manor” One of the top rated
dramas of the last ten years She is a very important woman

and she knows it

MS NEWMAN

I’m sorry to call you in here like
this It’s been a long week

a stressful one at that

DARCY

What is it you wanna talk about

MS NEWMAN

We’ve been making provisions to re-
write Jennifer’s character back
into the show We’re gonna be
bringing her back for next season

DARCY

I don’t understand Didn’t we kill

her off

MS NEWMAN

Yeah but the fans miss her

miss her a lot

DARCY

I know It takes time for any show
when they lose a cast member to --

MS NEWMAN
(interrupting)

No I’m afraid our problem runs a

bit deeper than that
(abruptly changing the
subject)

How rude of me Would you like a

drink Darcy

Darcy sits awkwardly silent -- anxious and uncertain

DARCY
Umm Sure

Ms Newman gives Darcy an unsure grin and briskly walks to a
corner liquor cabinet She pours herself and Darcy a shot of
scotch She gives Darcy an extra generous belt of the
liquor

Darcy notices this and becomes visibly worried

MS NEWMAN
We’ve had a thirty percent drop in
ratings since last season The
network feels it’s because of
Jennifer’s absence Quite frankly
they don’t feel we can last another
season without her The
competition is just too stiff

Ms Newman hands Darcy her drink and has a seat on the edge
of her desk

DARCY
Did she say something to you about
coming back

MS NEWMAN
No But I don’t think that will be
a problem Her new program hasn’t
taken off the way we expected
There’s already talks of a mid
season replacement She can easily
make the transition back to Beverly
Manor Make a surprise appearance
on the season finaleand our
ratings will go through the roof

DARCY
A surprise appearance But we
already wrapped for this season

MS NEWMAN
We’re gonna be re-shooting this
season’s last two episodes It’s
the majority opinion that in order
to get us back in the race our
last episode should be more of a
cliff hanger Something that will
wet the viewer’s appetite Make
them wanna tune in for another
season The producers feel with
focusing the story line on
Jennifer it could be our best year
ever

(23

DARCY
I see

MS NEWMAN
It seems the only logical way of
bringing Jennifer back this season
is if she exacts her much-awaited
revenge on Kristen Unfortunately
that would mean --

DARCY
(interrupting)
That would mean killing me off

MS NEWMAN
It’s a ratings war Darcy And
we’re losing fast In the end it
all comes down to the numbers

INT STAIRWAY - DARCY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Darcy begins up a flight of stairs with a large bag of
groceries looking completely disgusted Her annoying
neighbor MICHAEL (20s) boyishly handsome but a bit cocky
looks over a railing and notices her coming up the stairs

MICHAEL
Darcy

Darcy SIGHS in frustration -- continuing up the steps toward
her neighbor Michael meets her half-way His cocky smile
ear to ear

MICHAEL
Funny running into you like this
You coming up the steps just as I’m
leaving

DARCY
And how did I know I’d be running
into you today

MICHAEL
So you’ve been thinking about me

Darcy fights back a smile and looks away in embarrassment

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
You’re blushing

DARCY
I don’t blush

33

MICHAEL
You’re red as a beet

DARCY
I’m having a hot flash Now excuse
me I have ice cream melting

MICHAEL
I won’t keep you I was just
wondering if you’d had time to re-
think my offer for dinner

DARCY
I have

MICHAEL
So what did you decide

DARCY
I haven’t

Darcy passes Michael and continues up

MICHAEL
Okay I can see I got you at a had
time If you change your mind --
DARCY

I know where you live

Darcy disappears around a corner out of sight

INT DARCY’S APARTMENT -— DUSK

The BRIGHT SUN peaks itself through Darcy’s blinds and into
her living room

Darcy is sprawled out on the couch asleep On the table in
front of her sits a GIN AND TONIC and a half-empty bottle
Her PHONE RINGS This startles Darcy causing her to jump
She lets the phone ring eventually letting the answering
machine pick it up

MRS GOLD (0S)

MRS GOLD Oh So are you still coming

DARCY

about it before dinner

INT DINING ROOM - HOME OF HENRY AND SHARON GOLD

Darcy definitely enjoyed

Darcy and her two parents HENRY GOLD (50s) and SHARON GOLD
(50s) sit at the dinner table devouring a large home-cooked

meal Fried chicken mashed potatoes

MR GOLD

So what’s the big deal I thought

you liked Jennifer

DARCY
I do I guess

MR GOLD

So what’s the problem I think
it’ll be good for the show if she
came back Especially for your

character

MRS GOLD

I think Darcy’s concerned there
might not be room for both of them

on the show

MR GOLD

Hey Darcy You’ve got no reason
to be upset about this She’s been
on that program for seven years
It’s only your first season You
can’t just expect to win over her
fans just like that You’1ll have
to give them time to develop your

character

corn on the cob etc

Darcy puts down her fork and nervously folds her arms She
can’t even look her father in the eye let alone tell him the
real truth

MR GOLD (CONT’D)
But all that doesn’t matter What
matters is your mother and I are
proud of you You’ve accomplished
a lot this year I know we haven‘t
exactly been supportive But you
surprised the hell out of a lot of
people by staying sober the way you
have You should be proud of
yourself Just like we are

Darcy looks anything but proud

MRS GOLD
He’s right Darcy

Mrs Gold notices Darcy’s strange demeanor

MRS GOLD (CONT’D)
Honey Is there something you’re
not telling us You don’t look so
hot

Darcy pauses -- contemplates telling her parents she was let
go from the show but eventually backs down

DARCY
No I guess I’m just not that
hungry

MR GOLD

Listen to your father Don’t let
Jennifer Conway get you down
You’re a winner It’s in your
blood You’re just gonna have to
get used to it

Darcy sports a fake smile and scoops herself some mashed
potatoes

No Not then I didn’t hear about
that until later But I knew she
had a bad day You could tell she
just wanted to get the hell out of

suggested we go to her parent’s

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - UTAH -— DUSK

Darcy’s SUV barrels down the empty highway Surrounded by
BRIGHT RED LANDSCAPE In the bg we hear LOUD MUSIC
PLAYING from the interior of the truck

INT SUV

Darcy is behind the wheel with Casey up front and Leanne in
the back

LEANNE
So Darcy I hear you’re living
across the hall from Hannibal
Lector

Darcy doesn’t respond She simply stares over at Casey with
disgust

CASEY
Sorry I had to tell her

LEANNE
So what’s his problem anyway Is
he like leaving dead flowers on
your doorstep and writing you poems
in his own blood

DARCY
It’s not like that He’s harmless
He’s an actor and he’s new in the
building He’s just a little star
struck

(MORE)

DARCY (contd)
Once he finds out I’m out of a job
he’ll get over it Believe me

LEANNE
Casey said that you said he was
stalking you or something

CASEY
Was stalking her Not anymore
(to Darcy)
Isn’t that right Darcy

Darcy smacks Casey on the arm Leanne’s jaw drops as she
slowly figures it out

LEANNE
You slept with him You little
skank

DARCY
It was a mistake
(to Casey)
Why did you even do that

LEANNE
Oh I see You could tell her you
porked some weird stalker guy you
barely even know but you can’t
tell me

DARCY
Maybe it’s because I know you’d
freak out and call me pretty names
like ho-bag and skank

LEANNE
Well I’m sorry Darcy but I’m not
the one who’s constantly breaking
our pact

CASEY
A pact There’s a pact

LEANNE
Darcy and I decided that the next
relationship we were in we were
gonna hold out on our man for at
least three months The idea being
that any man that can last three
months is in it for more than sex

DARCY
Or he’s really lame and desperate

ay
oi

LEANNE
Oh So now I go with desperate
guys Is that it That the only
guy who could possibly be
interested in Leanne’s saggin’ tits
is some reject who hasn’t been laid
in five years Please Darcy
Don’t feel the need to spare my
feelings or anything Just come
out with it

CASEY
(to Leanne)
Oh yeah While we’re on the
subject Who’s pregnancy test did
I find in your waste basket last
week

DARCY
Busted Now who’s the skank

LEANNE
Okay First of all that wasn’t
mine

CASEY
It wasn’t mine I know it wasn’t
Darcy’s so who else could it be

LEANNE
If you’d shut up a second I could
tell you Casey

CASEY
Okay fine Tell us We’re all
ears

Darcy breaks out in hysterics

LEANNE (CONT’D)
I had a friend over She lives
with her folks She was too afraid
to do it at home so she used our
place

CASEY
Yeah right Leanne You’re so
busted

Darcy continues laughing uncontrollably

LEANNE

(to both)
What’re you guyslike a tag team
oer something

(to Casey)
I’m trying to talk to Darcy for a
second I’m trying to make a point
and you’re like re-directing
everything at me Getting all in
my face

DARCY
And how many times exactly did you
and Roger go out before he climbed
the great peaks of Mount Leanne

CASEY
Yeah really It couldn’t have
been more than twice

LEANNE
Yeah but it was over a span of
three months so that doesn’t
count

Darcy and Casey continue laughing at Leanne

LEANNE (CONTD)
It doesn’t count

EXT GAS STATION —- CONVENIENCE STORE

They approach an old worn down gas station and turn in --
parking in front of one of the pumps Out steps Darcy and
the two girls Darcy continues into the store

CASEY
Great going Leanne I should’ve
known better than to tell you
anything

LEANNE
What I’m bored Nobody said
anything for like two hours I
was just trying to liven things up
a bit

29

CASEY
Well you did Why’d you have to
say anything about her neighbor
Darcy’s never gonna tell me
anything again

LEANNE
Hey I’m sorry but I tell you guys
everything and

Leanne stops mid-sentence when she notices a suspicious MAN
(30s) blocking Darcy from entering the convenience store He
is being very flirtatious forcing himself on her He is a
typical red-neck cowboy with a full beard tank-top dark
shades and cowboy hat

CASEY
What is it

LEANNE
That cowboy won’t let Darcy inside

Casey also turns her attention to the door The cowboy
stands blocking Darcy from the doorway

Casey begins filling Darcy’s tank all the while watching the
greasy cowboy as he continues to taunt Darcy

CASEY
(to herself)
Just kick him in the balls Darcy

The cowboy finally gives up and lets Darcy pass He
continues to his truckA GREY DODGE PICK-UP sitting at the
far end of the lot

Casey watches the mysterious man as he returns her stare He
grins and points his finger at her all the while holding a
bottle of beer in the same hand He flicks his thumb as if
he’s pulling an imaginary trigger

Casey is visibly frightened by this

The cowboy crawls in his truck cranks up the engine He
sits waiting staring back at the girls in his rearview
mirror

Darcy coming out of the store

Casey hangs up the pump as she and Leanne get back in the
truck Darcy follows behind

INT SUV

Casey and Leanne stare into Darcy’s rearview mirror gazing
at the dirty pick-up in the distance

The girls pull out of the small lot and back onto the

highway They continue down the road a piece -- the grey

INT BAR - NIGHT

The three girls sit bellied up at the local bar doing shots
of tequila

Darcy is the ring leader setting the other two up with
another shot

DARCY
Raise your glasses

The three girls prepare for a toast
DARCY (CONT’D)
Here’s to Jennifer For her
triumphant but all too soon return
to Beverly Manor

CASEY
Here here I guess

The three girls tap glasses -- about to throw down another
shot until --

LEANNE
Wait

Casey and Darcy stare over at Leanne waiting

LEANNE (CONT’D)

The other day didn’t you say you
wanted to claw this chick’s eyes
out and smash her face with a
brick

Casey checks with Darcy

DARCY

So maybe it isn’t the most sincere
of toasts I’m just trying to be a
good sport

(changing the subject)
Okay For real this time All
joking aside Here’s to my mother
and father Henry and Sharon Gold
May their love only grow stronger
in these very difficult days that
lay ahead

Leanne looks over at Casey who returns her stare

They are

both suspicious of Darcy’s strange rhetoric The three girls

tap glasses throw back another shot

CASEY
(to Darcy)
Why don’t you ease up a bit Don’t
you think you’re hitting the booze
a little hard

DARCY
Yes I do On that note I think
I’1ll have another

Darcy pours herself another shot of Cuervo

DARCY (CONTD)

Are you gonna have one with me or
you gonna be a pain in my ass this
whole trip

Casey gives up and holds out her glass to Darcy who quickly

fills it

Leanne turns her attention to the front door and notices THE
COWBOY from earlier He struts over to the bar and bellies

up The bartender takes his order

(23

LEANNE
Oh great Don’t look now

Casey and Darcy notice him sitting down just a few feet away
They watch as he whispers something to the bartender

The bartender smiles and approaches the girls

BARTENDER
Excuse me ladies The gentleman at
the end of the bar will be taking
care of your tab this evening

CASEY
Tell him no thanks
DARCY
Tell him we appreciate it
CASEY
Darcy
DARCY

Let him pay Who cares

CASEY
I don’t want him hassling us again

DARCY
He didn’t hassle you he hassled
me If I wanna be hassled that’s
my problem

CASEY

You’re drinking too much
DARCY

No You’re just drinking too

SOME TIME LATER

Darcy and the cowboy are dancing Darcy is absolutely
obliterated Out of her mind drunk She is hanging all over
the cowboy and making a fool of herself

Casey and Leanne sit at a corner table way passed ready to
leave

LEANNE
Do you think we should say
something to her

LEANNE (contd)
I mean if she’s not careful she’s
gonna throw up all over his shirt
Just like at that club last month

Casey squints a bit confused

CASEY
Darcy said that was you

LEANNE
Whatever Can we just go get her
and leave

Casey reluctantly takes the job and walks over to Darcy and
her dance partner

CASEY
Excuse me We have to go

DARCY
Oh do we have to

Casey grabs her friend by the arm and pulls her away from the
cowboy They continue out of the bar as Leanne follows
behind

DARCY
(to cowboy)
Bye bye

Darcy is puking her guts up in the toilet as Leanne holds her
hair back

Casey walks in with a few cans of ginger ale She pours one
into a small cup of ice and rests it on a nearby sink

CASEY
How’s she doing

LEANNE
You wanna turn down her bed I’m
gonna try to move her

Casey steps out -- back into the bedroom Darcy tosses a few
more chunks into the commode Leanne takes a peek inside

LEANNE (CONT’D)
God What is that

Casey turns down the sheets on one of the two beds She

looks up and notices A MAN -- WEARING A DARK SKI MASK AND
BLACK COWBOY HAT -- staring into the window between the

drapes and into their room

INT SHERIFF PATTERSON’S CAR - DAY

Sheriff Patterson and DeSantis cruise down a dusty piece of
highway side by side
DESANTIS
I hear this isn’t the first time a
woman’s been abducted in Bryerson

Sheriff Patterson smiles at DeSantis’s coy persistence

SHERIFF PATTERSON
So you heard about that did you

DESANTIS
You wanna tell me about Janet
Cooney

SHERIFF PATTERSON

Not much to tell She was this
hooker Drifted in to town some
years back She was out there on
the highway sellin’ her ass for
about two years One night some
john picks her up beats her damn
near to death then drops her in
the desert right where he found
her

DESANTIS
No leads

SHERIFF PATTERSON
No She’s got no known family We
couldn’t get anyone to claim the
body After the autopsy we had
her cremated Outside her
occupation no one seems to know
much about her

DESANTIS
So what’s your take on what
happened

Sheriff Patterson stares suspiciously over at DeSantis
Reluctant to answer

SHERIFF PATTERSON
We found a switchblade in the dirt
near Cooney’s body covered in
blood Her right thumb and finger
were sliced up real good
Examiner said she cut herself with
the blade So I’m thinking he
starts getting rough with her so
she pulls the knife

DeSantis going over the case in his head and comparing his
theories with the Sheriff

SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
He tries to knock the knife out of
her hand and she cuts herself
(MORE)

(23
SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
Then he starts in on beating her
Only he don’t stop When he’s
done he drags her into the desert
and off he goes into the sweet bye
and bye

DESANTIS
What about the possibility this
guy’s local

SHERIFF PATTERSON
I don’t think so Her house was
only a quarter mile up the road
from where we found her That’s
where she usually took her johns
I think this guy wanted a quickie
for the road Besides A local
knows about a thousand better
hiding places for that body than on
the side of the highway in plain
view No This guy was ina
panic

DESANTIS
That would be true Unless he
wanted you to find her body

Sheriff Patterson turns and gives DeSantis a discerning
stare

SHERIFF PATTERSON
I know what you’re getting at Now
just in case you’re thinking
there’s a connection between the
Cooney murder and your girl getting
snatched you can hold it right
there

DESANTIS
I didn’t say that

SHERIFF PATTERSON
No but you’re hinting at it I’m
not as slow as you think DeSantis

DESANTIS
You got a small town Sheriff I
wouldn’t think this type of thing
happens every day

SHERIFF PATTERSON
No it doesn’t

33

DESANTIS
And you don’t think there’s a
possibility of a connection

SHERIFF PATTERSON
I watched that girl for years
peddling her ass on that highway
It was a matter of time before some
nut job passing through town broke
her neck or cut her throat The
last thing I wanna do is scream
serial killer and get everyone in
town into an uproar They’ll be
burning up my phone line every time
little Susie’s late getting home
from cheerleading

DeSantis visibly grows weary of Sheriff Patterson’s uncaring
lazy attitude

SHERIFF PATTERSON
This isn’t LA It’s peaceful here
For the last twenty years these
people have been looking to me to
keep it that way If word gets out
I’m losing control then all hell
breaks loose

INT MOTEL ROOM - CRIME SCENE

The sound of a door being unlocked Enter DeSantis and
Sheriff Patterson The first thing DeSantis notices are the
MINUTE DROPS OF BLOOD on the carpet leading into the
bathroom

HIS POV
DeSantis looks into the bathroom and instantly notices the
BLOODY HANDPRINT on the interior wall of the shower (No
shower curtain)
BACK TO SCENE
The two men continue further into the room DeSantis takes
notice of the barren hook on the wall where a picture once
hung

SHERIFF PATTERSON

I figured they started fighting
right about here

44

Sheriff Patterson stands near the center of the room where
the picture fell from the wall

DeSantis notices small pieces of broken glass and a BLOODY
RIGHT HANDPRINT The small print of a young woman

SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
Looks like they started fighting
he throws her into the wall
knocking the picture down and
shattering the frame That’s
probably where she cut herself
She falls right about here and
bleeds out

DeSantis turns his attention from the bloody spot to yet
another BLOOD STAIN about ten feet away A good foot from
that stain are TWO MORE BLOODY HANDPRINTS The prints are
small and delicate

He approaches the blood evidence kneels down to take a
closer look

In the corner of the room sits a small round table There is
a small BLOOD SMEAR on the edge of the table

DeSantis then motions toward the BLOOD STAIN and HANDPRINTS
on the carpet -- connecting all the dots in his head

He stands and motions toward the bed The blankets are
turned down on only half of the bed as if only one person
has slept in it

DESANTIS
You get the lab results from
forensics

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Yeah They pulled a blonde hair
from the bed sheets and crossed it
with a sample from Darcy’s hair
brush No match
DeSantis stays focused on the crime scene completely
ignoring Sheriff Patterson

INT BATHROOM

MOMENTS LATER

DeSantis kneels over the bathtub takes a peek Sheriff
Patterson hovers behind him DeSantis notices the prints of
THREE BLOODY FINGERTIPS on the edge of the tub

SHERIFF PATTERSON

You notice anything missing

DESANTIS

The shower curtain

SHERIFF PATTERSON

He used it to wrap the body

DESANTIS

There’s three print smears on the
edge of the tub plus the
handprint But the rest of the
shower’s immaculate It’s like he
cleaned around it

SHERIFF PATTERSON

Looks like she regained
consciousness and tried to get out

DESANTIS

What’s wrong with this picture

SHERIFF PATTERSON

The handprint It’s too high up
the wall If your girl were flat
on her back there’s no way she’d
reach

DESANTIS

Very good Sheriff but what does
it mean

INT SHERIFF PATTERSON’S HOME - OFFICE - NIGHT

DeSantis sifts
both the Janet
was assaulted
feet kicked up

through a stack of CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from

Cooney murder and the motel room where Darcy
Sheriff Patterson sits comfortably with his

on a desk waiting for DeSantis to finish

SHERIFF PATTERSON

I don’t know what you think you’re
gonna find but we’ve been over
every inch of those things a
thousand times

DESANTIS
It never hurts to have a fresh pair
of eyes

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Look If I don’t get to bed my
wife’s gonna come looking for me

DeSantis picks up a large PHOTO OF JANET COONEY’S BODY from
the desk It is a FULL SHOT of her body laying idle in the
desert Her LEFT ARM lay fully extended and exposed Her
RIGHT ARM is carefully place behind her back

He lays the picture down and reviews the next a CLOSE UP of
the deceaseds LEFT HAND There are severe cuts on the
woman’s thumb and index finger Self-inflicted wounds caused
by a switchblade

DESANTIS
Wait a minute

SHERIFF PATTERSON
What

DeSantis picks up another CRIME SCENE PHOTO from the desk
the BLOODY HANDPRINT of Darcy’s LEFT HAND on the shower wall

He lays the photo down and picks up another a shot of
another BLOODY HANDPRINT on the motel room’s carpet Darcy’s
wounded RIGHT HAND after she is violently tossed to the
floor

DESANTIS
There’s only one print on the
carpet

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Yeah

DESANTIS
If Darcy cut both her hands on the
glass then why is there only a
right hand print on the carpet

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Simple Her left hand never
touched the floor

DESANTIS

Maybe Or someone else cut it for
her

(23

SHERIFF PATTERSON
What’re you saying

DeSantis tosses down a photo and picks up another This one
is a CLOSE UP of Cooney’s RIGHT ARM placed carefully behind
her back

DESANTIS
Cooney’s arm was found behind her
back I don’t think this was
coincidence This is how your guy
restrained her She didn’t die in
that car Your guy walked her into
the desert first

The wheels begin to turn in Sheriff Patterson’s eyes

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
Then he wraps her arm around her
back and listens to her scream in
pain as she begs for her life You
know what else I think he did the
same thing to Darcy

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Now hold on Don’t you think
you’re getting a little ahead of
yourself All this could be
coincidence

DESANTIS
That’s why the left hand print He
pulls Darey’s arm around her back
Just like he did to Cooney That’s
when he cut her He cuts her left
hand and plants her print on the
shower wall

DeSantis picks up the photo of Cooney’s LEFT HAND severely
wounded from a knife

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
Darcy’s left hand print That’s
what he wanted us to find That’s
the connection

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Find what And what connection

trying to tell you now Sheriff

INT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

DeSantis Sheriff Patterson and The Golds sit at a large
conference table discussing the investigation

The Golds appear very weary They look as if they’ve been
erying non-stop for days

DESANTIS
Has Darcy mentioned anything to you
about getting strange phone calls
or if someone might be following
her

MR GOLD
If there were someone like that
she wouldn’t tell us

MRS GOLD
She doesn’t like to worry us
We’ve always been very protective
with Darcy When her drugs started
getting out of control we put her
in a hospital When she got out
we insisted she come stay with us
for awhile She didn’t want any
part of it But the network
insisted she stayed under strict
supervision those first few months
out of the program She’s barely
spoken with us since

DeSantis is locked into every word A look of intense
concentration consumes his face

MR GOLD
She was hell bent on jumping right
back into her career No matter
how much we were against it

DeSantis looks to be in deep thought pondering what The
Golds have told him He snaps out of it and turns his
attention back to The Golds

DESANTIS
Thank you

EXT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT — DAY

Mr Gold takes his dog for a short walk across the parking
lot leash in hand Sharon stands in front of the office
puffs away at a cigarette taking one nervous drag after the
next as DeSantis exits the building He spots her quietly
having a seat on an outside bench

MRS GOLD
It really is beautiful country
isn’t it

DeSantis stares off into the mountains as if for the first
time

DESANTIS
Yes it certainly is I guess I
never stopped to notice

MRS GOLD
I forgot how much I missed it here
It’s so quiet Sometimes I wonder
if Darcy were better off being
raised in a small town Someplace
where people don’t walk all over
you or spit on you so much as look
at you

Sharon nervously reaching for another smoke sparking it up
DeSantis noticing her slowly growing angry almost breaking
out into tears

MRS GOLD (CONT’D)
But we were the typical Hollywood
family Darcy spent most of her
childhood either listening to Henry
and I argue or watching us drink
Our whole world revolved around the
next audition or getting picked up
by some stupid pilot And it was
always a competition We thought
our lives would change if we had a
baby and stopped thinking about
ourselves But it didn’t Nothing
ever changed

Sharon’s eyes remain locked on Henry now tossing a tennis
ball with his dog

MRS GOLD (CONT’D)
Except now instead of two angry
people in the house there were
three I remember when things got
too hot between Henry and me at the
dinner tableDarcy would ask if
the three of us could go get ice
cream We would always give in
Every time It seems like every
other night after dinner we were
sitting down at Scoops Watching
each other eat ice cream None of
us saying a damn thing But it
always put a smile on Darcy’s face
Henry and I would just look at each
other smiling at what a little con
artist she was She was funny that
way

Sharon turns smiling at DeSantis who politely returns her
grin

MRS GOLD (CONT’D)

I guess she had to have a sense of
humor living with the two of us
Imagine our shock when Darcy
announced she wanted to be an
actress like her mommy I guess
in a way she’d been performing her
whole life That’s all she ever
knew how to do

DeSantis slowly drifts off into a daydream contemplating
what Sharon has told him

Looks like he siphoned the gas out
of Darcy’s truck the night before
And so the game continues

DESANTIS
You get a lead on the owner

SHERIFF PATTERSON
No tags no registration and not
one visible VIN on the entire car

DESANTIS
Anything else

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Take a look for yourself

Sheriff Patterson begins toward the driver’s side of the
vehicle

DeSantis follows behind

Sheriff Patterson motions toward bright RED BLOOD on the
outside of the driver’s door

SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)
Red paint It’s all over the
interior

DeSantis peeks his head inside taking in the carefully
staged crime scene Fake blood is carefully spattered on the

steering wheel headrest dashboard and windshield

DESANTIS
So what do you make of this

SHERIFF PATTERSON
To the untrained eye like Darcy
this might look a helluva lot like
a gunshot wound to the head close
range

DeSantis pulls his head from the window and faces The

Sheriff

SHERIFF PATTERSON (CONT’D)

And just when she figures him for
dead she opens the door to check
his ID and off he goes

DESANTIS
ID

Sheriff Patterson hands DeSantis a black wallet

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Found it in the backseat along with
a mess of stolen credit cards no
cash The cards were scattered
everywhere and the wallet was
empty Your girl probably spotted
it in the backseat and got in to
get a closer look

DESANTIS
It’s a set-up He makes it so he
got shot by some drifter who
snagged his cash

SHERIFF PATTERSON
This guy sure went through a lot of
trouble to snatch your girlfriend
DeSantis

DESANTIS
Yeah Looks that way

DeSantis brushes off the Sheriff Sheriff Patterson’s eyes

never leave the detective

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
If he dumped her she can’t he far

SHERIFF PATTERSON
The dogs are on their way It’1l
be sun-up in about an hour

been happy for awhile you know

DESANTIS
Do her parents know about us

CASEY

INT MR AND MRS GOLD’S MOTEL ROOM

Henry and Sharon lay awake in bed Sharon in Henry’s arms
searching for some comfort at this very difficult time
Thoughts of their daughter’s safety consume their every
second

over and answers

MR GOLD
Hello
No one
MR GOLD (CONT’D)
Hello

Who is this

Sharon quickly sits up putting her ear to the phone and
listening for a voice on the other line

STRANGE MAN (0S)
I’m watching you

A stunned Sharon covers her mouth to keep from screaming
Suddenlythere is a LOUD KNOCK at the door The Golds
almost jump off the bed in a panic as Sharon lets out a
horrible shriek

MR GOLD
Stay here

Mr Gold reluctantly heads for the front door He opens and
walks outside --

INTEXT MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mr Gold looks into the distance and notices the strange
COWBOY -- black cowboy hat and face mask -- on a DIRT BIKE
sitting at the edge of the motel parking lot He is revving
his engine and staring back at Mr Gold

Mr Gold simply stands in shock unsure of his next move He
only returns the man’s stare He is helpless

Mrs Gold runs to the doorway and notices something taped on
the door itself It is a polaroid of Darcy streaked in
blood Her throat has apparently been slit Her lifeless
eyes staring back at us Mrs Gold instantly turning away
from the photo covering her mouth She vomits slightly in
between her fingers stumbling to the floor in shock

The cowboy speeds off down the dark highway kicking up a
mound of dirt and dust into the air

Mrs Gold SCREAMS out in horror Mr Gold runs back into the
room noticing the picture He also SCREAMS out in agony at
this gruesome sight He grabs his wife and holds her tight
as they grieve for their daughter together Then the PHONE
RINGS again Mr Gold rushes over to answer

MR GOLD
Hello

THE COWBOY (V0)
This must be daddy

MR GOLD
Yes This is Henry Gold

THE COWBOY (V0)
Good Pay close attention Henry
Now you know I’m watching you
That means I see things When you
take your next piss before you
fuck one more inch of that wife of
yours I’‘1ll know about it Tell me
you understand

MR GOLD
Yeah I get it

Mrs Gold hovers over the toilet dry heaving She is in
complete shock sick beyond description

Mr Gold rushes over to her getting her attention She
stares up at him

MRS GOLD
Oh my God Henry

Mr Gold shuts his eyes unable to bear the scene before him
He quickly turns away from his wife trying to focus

THE COWBOY (V0)
Now understand this Henry If you
involve one more cop or step one
foot outside this city without my
permissionI let the whore die
Now’s the part where you ask me
what I want

MR GOLD
What do you want

THE COWBOY (V0)
Good boy I want five hundred
thousand cash not a penny less

MR GOLD
II don’t know I don’t have
that kind of money Be reasonable
I can get you some money but

THE COWBOY (V0)
(interrupting)

Now come on Henry Your
daughter’s worth it I know who
she is There’s a lot of people
who wanna see her live You’re in
charge of seeing she does

The cowboy hangs up

INT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

DeSantis The Golds Casey and Leanne gather around the
table as Sheriff Patterson stands at the helm

SHERIFF PATTERSON

This was only a warning of what
he’1ll do to her if we don’t meet
his demands He’s asking for half
a million cash

(to The Golds
I assume you and your wife don’t
have that kind of money laying
around

MR GOLD
No We’ve got about 100000 in
savings a few bonds Nothing
close

MRS GOLD
Maybe if we made a good faith
payment it could buy us some more
time

SHERIFF PATTERSON
It won’t work It’s got to be
500000 Not a dime less or he
kills Darcy Now it’s obvious this
man knows who she is and what kind
of cash she’s capable of raising
He’s not looking to settle

MRS GOLD
But Darcy’s just getting started
She doesn’t have that kind of
money

DESANTIS
But she knows people who do
People who would want to help her
Our guy knows that

MR GOLD
What’re you saying

DESANTIS

The only option we have is going to
KBS I think our guy’s counting on

that

LEANNE
The network

DESANTIS

If this goes public and the press
finds out they refused to put up
Darcy’s ransom they’1ll have a
field day with it After just
letting Darcy out of her contract
I’m sure they won’t want any more
bad publicity

MRS GOLD
I don’t understand Darcy’s
missing possibly dead and you’re
talking about publicity

DESANTIS

As twisted as it may sound putting

up Darcy’s ransom is a ratings
booster Once we get her back a
lot of people are gonna want to
hear her story If they’re smart

the execs at KBS will want her back

alive as soon as possible

Casey looks to be in deep thought -- contemplating something
She finally breaks her silence --

CASEY
What if we can’t get the money in
time You can’t be sure KBS will
just hand over this kind of cash
with no questions asked

59
(23

SHERIFF PATTERSON
I’m gonna have to agree with
DeSantis on this one If they know
they’re Darcy’s only hope they’1l
cooperate They have a lot more to
gain by getting her back

CASEY
It just seems like too big a risk

MRS GOLD
No This won’t work There’s got
to be an easier way of getting this
money Maybe from the police or
the FBI Don’t they prepare for
situations like this

SHERIFF PATTERSON
He said if we involve the police or
FBI he’s gone and Darcy’s as good
as dead

MRS GOLD
You don’t know that

DESANTIS
You already know he’s been watching
our every move I guarantee you
he’‘ll be watching this one

MR GOLD
Time’s already running out How do
you know for certain that these
people at the network will
cooperate

you were me Just days after you
let Darcey out of her contract her
ex fiance shows up asking for
500000 in ransom money You
wouldn’t think that the least

I don’t know I guess it would
depend on my personal relationship

don’t have a lot of time here --

DESANTIS

It sounds suspicious I know But
believe me this couldn’t be more —-

MS NEWMAN
Why haven’t I heard anything about
this until now Why haven’t you
alerted the police or the FBI about
Darcy’s disappearance

DESANTIS
If you’d just listen one second --

MS NEWMAN
I wonder what your Captain would
feel about all this I’m sure
you’ve alerted him of Darcy’s
abduction Maybe I should give him
a call and we can straighten this
out right now

Ms Newman picks up her phone DeSantis quickly grabs it and
slams it down on the receiver

they’ll take your head off If I
don’t do it first

DESANTIS
You hear anything

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Oh we’re just getting flooded with
phone calls here DeSantis If you
bothered putting a hole in that
cowboy I guess we could be checking
the local hospitals for gunshot
wounds

DeSantis hangs his head low -- in shame Yet he remains
focused and continues droning on about the case

DESANTIS
I’m guessing he ditched the bike
and had a back up car waiting
somewhere close by

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Is that right You know you’re
always one step ahead of us good
ole’ boys aren’t you Or maybe
you’re just covering for the fact
that you just plain fucked up out

spend four days a week at the

contempt

nerve for him to charge me the way
he did It’s like he knew I
wouldn’t take the shot

That’s real interesting DeSantis
Why the hell would he think that

Because he knows I’ve figured out
who he is

You’ve figured it all out Well
tell me DeSantis -- Who is he If
you don’t mind letting the rest of
us simple minds in on your little
secret

Somebody close to Darcy A friend
A boyfriend maybe

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Darcy’s boyfriend They’re all in
cahoots together now Is that it

It’s the only explanation I can
come up with

Sheriff Patterson lowers his head and shakes it in

shaking his head in

frustration He picks up a PHOTOGRAPH from his desk hands

it to DeSantis -- who inspects it
INSERT - PHOTO OF JANET COONEY
Her dead body is bruised and badly beaten

SHERIFF PATTERSON
That look familiar to you Billy
found that in the pick-up under
the driver’s seat Now unless
Darcy’s boyfriend drove into town
to beat Cooney to death I’d say

this new little theory of yours is

one big fuckin’ steaming pile of
horse shit

DeSantis shuts his eyes in embarrassment He hands the photo

to Deputy Bracken who is smiling from ear to ear

admit this was a situation you

That would make too big of a mess

let him have it

MR GOLD (CONT’D)

You wanna help us now Sheriff
You tell the FBI everything You
tell them how you insisted on
keeping them from my daughter’s
investigation to cover your ass
Then maybe you can tell them how
you let a Los Angeles detective a

you kept it quiet

DeSantis doesn’t respond He only smiles and changes

subject

DeSantis passes Casey and exits the room

DESANTIS
You know what I think Casey

CASEY
No

DESANTIS
I think the best thing for all of
us now is to walk away

CASEY
You didn’t help her Charlie You
only made things worse by not
calling the police You have to
tell The Sheriff about this

EXT DESERT - CRIME SCENE - DAY

We CLOSE ON the skeletal decomposed remains of DARCY GOLD on
the red desert sand

SUPERIMPOSE

BRYERSON UTAH
THREE WEEKS LATER

Standing hovered over the body is Sheriff Patterson and
Deputy Bracken

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Where was she buried

DEPUTY BRACKEN
We found a shallow hole and white
shower curtain about a hundred
yards from here It was chewed up
pretty good Looks like the damn
coyotes got to her

SHERIFF PATTERSON
What about The Golds

DEPUTY BRACKEN
Haven’t called them yet I was
waiting on you

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Call the coroner I wanna get her
out of here before I start making
the calls

DEPUTY BRACKEN
You got it

Deputy Bracken begins off as Sheriff Patterson stares at the
wretched decomposed body with disgust

We PULL AWAY and GO WIDER AND WIDER to reveal Sheriff
Patterson standing a good hundred yards from a SHALLOW GRAVE

As we stare into the grave we notice a large AREA RUG
inside The remains of a WHITE SHOWER CURTAIN lay some ten
to fifteen feet from the grave

INT CITY MORGUE - DAY

Sheriff Patterson stands hovered over Darcy’s remains which
lay on an examination table Also standing over the body is
a young FORENSIC EXAMINER who is discussing the condition of
the body with The Sheriff

FORENSIC EXAMINER
There is one visible entry wound on
the victim’s chest It was caused
by a small thin blade
approximately 3 inches in length
and 1 inch in diameter Probably a
pocket knife of some sort

DeSantis enters the room -- grabbing the attention of a not
30 thrilled Sheriff Patterson

He tosses DeSantis a dirty stare as the young detective
approaches the examination table

FORENSIC BXAMINER (CONT’D)
The victim also suffered a
fractured skull and jaw Although
she was stabbed she died of
extreme hemorrhaging in the brain
as a result of trauma to the head

DeSantis focuses on the hody closely

FORENSIC BXAMINER (CONT’D)
Upon first examination we find
Maggot mass aggregation in the
pelvic and genital regions of the
body and also in the skull and
nasal cavities It was the
particularly small size of the
larvae that I found interesting
The fact that these maggots
remained stabilized and didn’t
continue their growth cycle
suggests the body remained in a
cooler climate I also found empty
puparium on the underside of the
body and on the remains of the
shower curtain

SHERIFF PATTERSON
What does that mean

FORENSIC EXAMINER
It means that the victim had
remained under ground for a
duration of no less than twenty
days Which places time of death
at the latest one to two days
maybe even hours after her
abduction

(23

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Is there anything else about the
body we should know about

FORENSIC EXAMINER
There’s no signs of sexual assault

DeSantis shuts his eyes -- sighing in relief

SHERIFF PATTERSON
Anything else

FORENSIC EXAMINER
There is one thing

DeSantis quickly opens his eyes and turns his attention back
to the examiner

FORENSIC EXAMINER (CONT’D)
The size of the maggots in the
victim’s nasal cavity is of a
particularly large size Almost
three times the normal size to be
precise This strongly suggests
years of repeated cocaine abuse

SHERIFF PATTERSON
She was a coke addict

DESANTIS
I don’t see the importance of that
now

FORENSIC EXAMINER
As you know Detective I’m legally
obligated to record any forms of
substance abuse in my report It’s
for identification purposes

DESANTIS
I can appreciate that But as far
as this girl’s parents are
concerned she never had a coke
problem and has been drug free and
sober for eight months When the
press gets a hold of this she‘’1ll
be all over the front page

FORENSIC EXAMINER
What is it exactly you’re asking me
to do detective

(MORE)

FORENSIC EXAMINER (contd)
To falsify my findings in order to
ease the grieving process of this
girl’s parents

DESANTIS
Sheriff Would you excuse us a
moment

Sheriff Patterson reluctantly steps out of the office
DeSantis gives the examiner the evil eye The examiner
simply returns his stare The two men stand silent staring
each other down We then very slowly

FADE OUT

INT HALLWAY - CITY MORGUE

The Golds Casey and Leanne await in a hallway outside the
examination room The Golds sit on a bench grasping each
others hands tight as Casey and Leanne pace back and forth on
the cold hard floor

Sheriff Patterson and DeSantis exit the exam room catching
everyone’s attention

Mr Gold quickly stands and approaches The Sheriff

SHERIFF PATTERSON
I’m very sorry

Mr Gold loses control -- SCREAMING out in despair and
crumbling to his knees Sheriff Patterson grabs him but is
pulled down by his weight The two men both fall to their
knees He slowly puts his arms around Mr Gold comforting
him

Mrs Gold pulls her husband away from The Sheriff and holds
him tight

Casey and Leanne also weep for their friend They walk over
to The Golds and place their arms around them They all hug
and mourn together

Sheriff Patterson shuts his eyes unable to witness the
unbearable scene before him

DeSantis is taken over by guilt He turns and walks off

Sheriff Patterson turns and notices that DeSantis has
suspiciously left

VERY WIDE SHOT of the worn old station From a distance we
see DeSantis’ car pull into the station and park in front of

INT POLICE STATION - LAPD — INTERNAL AFFAIRS — DAY

TWO MEN enter the division of Internal Affairs The first
man through the door is LT WOLF (40s) Following behind is
DETECTIVE AARONSON (30s) a very youthful appearance Sitting
at his desk behind a computer is DETECTIVE HARRIS (40s)

LT WOLF
Harris Wake up

Det Harris spins around in his chair facing Lt Wolf

DET HARRIS
Yeah

LT WOLF
I want you to meet Detective Kyle
Aaronson

The two men shake

DET AARONSON
Hey there

LT WOLF
It’s his first official day with
I-AD I’m putting him with you on
the DeSantis case

DET HARRIS
Have you already been briefed

DET AARONSON
No not yet

DET HARRIS
Take a seat

Det Aaronson has a seat across from Harris while Lt Wolf

stands hovered over the men

stack of thick files on DeSantis

DET HARRIS (CONT’D)
Detective Charlie DeSantis
harcotics division A degenerate
gambler wife beater and all around
bad guy We just got word from one
of our CI’s that he’s into Artie
Vittero for 75 grand Coming out
of vice I’m sure you’re aware of
Mr Vittero’s activities

DET AARONSON
(nodding in agreement)
oh yes

DET HARRIS
This CI says that DeSantis has
less than three weeks to square his
debt or he’s a dead man Now it
just so happens that DeSantis
requests a stress leave and
mysteriously leaves Los Angeles

DET AARONSON
He’s on the run

LT WOLF
Exactly The word from his Captain
is DeSantis needed some personal
time to deal with his partner’s
recent death He’s been cracking
up ever since he saw him killed

DET HARRIS
According to this CI DeSantis
has been bringing a lot of heat
down on himself by putting
thousands of dollars in counterfeit
cash onto the streets

LT WOLF
Supposedly there may even be a
price on his head He said the
word is he’s been making a lot of
drug buys Generating some names

Det Harris hands Aaronson a

(23

DET HARRIS
We think he’s been trying to get
closer to a Ramon Vasquez an east
side cholo piece a shit who shot
his partner six months ago

DET AARONSON
They never caught this guy

LT WOLF
By the time they found Vasquez
DeSantis had already beaten him
within an inch of his life
Vasquez’s lawyer saw to it that all
charges against his client were
dropped Ever since DeSantis has
been trying to put him away He’s
obsessed

MATCH CUT TO

INT DESANTIS HOME

DeSantis sits at the kitchen table with the SILVER BRIEFCASE
opened He stares into the case at the money

DET AARONSON (V0)
So where did all this money come
from

He grabs a hand full of the cash and stuffs it into a manila
envelope

DET HARRIS (V0)
We have reason to believe DeSantis
stole over 2 million in counterfeit
cash from a drug bust he says went
sour

He wraps a rubber band around the envelope
LT WOLF (V0)
Narcotics sends him in with the
funny money to make the deal
Fifty kis

He walks to his bedroom grabs a long coat from his closet

LT WOLF (V0)
According to DeSantis they put a
gun to his head and made out with
the coke and the cash

DET HARRIS (V0)
He says somebody on the inside blew
his cover Somebody told them he
was a cop all right It was
DeSantis

DeSantis stuffs the envelope into his coat pocket

DET AARONSON (V0)
And he keeps the phoney cash handy
to support his gambling habit

DET HARRIS (V0)
And pay off his debts

DeSantis walks to the kitchen and shuts the SILVER BRIEFCASE

full of cash

LT WOLF (V0)
I just got off the phone with
Captain Gruber in narcotics He
says he just got a call from
Bryerson Utah Sheriff’s office
The Sheriff there says DeSantis has
been there for weeks investigating
the kidnapping of an old
girlfriend Darcy Gold He says
he thought we should know

DeSantis walks to the center of his living room and pulls
open an ATTIC DOOR He unfolds a small ladder from the attic

and begins up the small steps

DET HARRIS (V0)
She’s an actress here in LA The
word is DeSantis went to Darcy’s
producer at KBS an Alicia Newman
and requested the 500000 in
ransom money

THE ATTIC

DeSantis places the silver briefcase in a dark corner out of

sight

(23

DET HARRIS (V0)
He told her whoever snatched Darcy
contacted him and said if he didn’t
get the money within 48 hours he’d
kill her

He begins back down the ladder and into the living room

DET AARONSON (V0)
And they actually gave him the
money

DeSantis folds up the ladder and shuts the attic door

DET AARONSON (V0)
So what happened

EXT DESANTIS HOME —- DUSK

DeSantis exits his home -- walks to his car and gets in He
pulls out of the driveway as we watch him begin down the
street

LT WOLF (V0)
A couple days ago the Bryerson
Sheriff’s office found a body in
the desert The coroner officially
identified the body as one Darcy
Gold

DET HARRIS (V0)
Meanwhile Darcy’s killer has
mysteriously disappeared into thin
air and no one has the first clue
who he is or where to find him

EXT HOME OF HENRY AND SHARON GOLD - DUSK
Mr Gold exits -- makes his way toward the mail box
LT WOLF (V0)
Bottom line we think DeSantis is

working with someone

DET AARONSON (V0
Who

LT WOLF (CONT’D)(VO)
The same person who kidnapped and
murdered Darcy Gold Who that is
we don’t know yet

DET AARONSON (V0)
What does this Utah Sheriff have to
say about it

LT WOLF (V0O)
He’s obviously suspicious of
DeSantis But he doesn’t have all
the facts And that’s how we’re
gonna keep it DeSantis is a smart
cop

Mr Gold approaches the mail box and opens it -- pulling out
the day’s mail

LT WOLF (V0)
He’11 smell trouble a mile away
The smartest thing we can do now is
wait

DET AARONSON (VO)
Wait for what

Mr Gold sifts through the mail and notices an envelope with
the logo WESTLAKE INSURANCE at the top left corner

DET HARRIS (V0)
Wait for him to relax and think he
got away with it

Mr Gold opens the envelope and pulls out a check in the
amount of 15 MILLION DOLLARS

DET HARRIS (V0)
Hopefully he’1ll slip up and get
careless And that’s when we’1l
nail him
A look of pure shock consumes Mr Gold’s face

INT HOME OF HENRY AND SHARON GOLD - KITCHEN —- NIGHT

Mrs Gold is busy putting away leftover fried chicken and
mashed potatoes into tupperware containers She is cleaning
up the kitchen after a large family supper She peaks
through the kitchen window and spots her husband and Darcy on
a porch swing outside

Darcy’s head is rested in her father’s lap as she finishes a
bowl of ice cream He lovingly strokes her hair back as they
continue to swing back and forth

Mrs Gold smiles at the loving scene Darcy’s like a kid
again

She begins wiping her father’s nose He snatches the tissue
from her hand as he begins coughing like crazy

DARCY (CONT’D)
Are you okay

MR GOLD

He continues to cough

Mrs Gold stares at her husband through the kitchen window
with a look of concern on her face

MRS GOLD (CONT’D)
Oh well We can’t turn back time

Darcy notices her mother’s obvious gloom

DARCY
Mom Has Daddy been doing okay
He doesn’t look so hot

MRS GOLD
He’s been sick on and off for a few
weeks now

DARCY
Has he been to a doctor

MRS GOLD
You know your father He’d be
bleeding from the eyes before he
stepped into a hospital

Darcy stares at her mother with suspicion She continues out
of the kitchen Mrs Gold turns and notices that Darcy has
left the room She sighs in relief

INT BATHROOM

Darcy walks in and over to the sink -- begins filling the
drinking glass with the cold water

She can’t help but notice a stack of magazines sitting to the
left of the faucet On top sits a special medical magazine
entitled WHAT EVERY PATIENT NEEDS TO KNOW

She picks up the magazine and begins flipping through it
She spots a page marked SECTION 1 PREPARING FOR YOUR
TRANSPLANT She flips through a few more pages and spots a
page marked SECTION 2 THE TRANSPLANT PROCESS

Darcy sets the magazine back where she found it She looks
up and stares at herself in a side mirror She opens the
side cabinet and spots A PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE She pulls the
bottle from the cabinet and reads the label It is marked
PROPRANOLOL She also notices a large liquid glass
container A medical label reads LACTULOSE

She puts the medication back in the cabinet as a look of pure
fear covers her face

Darcy sits at home at her computer doing research She is
on the website DOGPILECOM She types in the words
PROPRANOLOL and LACTULOSE into the search box and hits fetch

A medical webpage pops up

INSERT - PARAGRAPH

“Some patients who have had bleeding from ruptured varicose
veins in the lower oesophagus may be put onto a drug called
Propranolol which reduces the pressure in those veins and
lowers the chances of them bleeding again Finally liver
transplantation may be considered in patients with end-stage
cirrhosis”

driver’s side door opens and out steps MICHAEL (Darcy’s
neighbor) He is carrying the BLACK MONEY BAG He turns the
bag upside down and dumps several heavy books onto the
ground

MICHAEL
That’s real good thinking
detective Something tells me you
don’t exactly trust me

DESANTIS
Stop where I can see you

DeSantis pulls his gun out and points it at Michael -- who
quickly drops the black bag and places his hands in the air

MICHAEL
Take it easy If I wanted to kill
you I would’ve done it back in
that alley
DESANTIS
Turn and face the car and put your
hands on the hood
Michael laughs -- shakes his head in disgust

MICHAEL
I don’t believe this

Michael reluctantly turns and places his palms on the hood of
the car DeSantis quickly pats him down for weapons

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
I don’t have a gun anymore
remember

DESANTIS
Shut up

DeSantis walks to the trunk of his car and opens it He
pulls out another large BLACK BAG and begins back to Michael
He places the bag on the roof of Michael’s car and unzips it
He pulls out his share of the money and tosses it in front of
Michael -- who is still palms down on the hood

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
It’s all there

Michael reaches down and grabs a hand full of the cash
DESANTIS (CONT’D)
You know what you have to do to get

the rest

Michael backs away from the hood with the money in hand

MICHAEL
I’ve been doing some thinking about
that

DESANTIS
Oh yeah What’ve you been thinking
about

MICHAEL
I was thinking if and when I were
to do this how do I know you’11
keep your word and pay me my money

DESANTIS
You don’t

MICHAEL
Then what if I were to tell you to
go to hell

DESANTIS
Then I let Darcy look at that long
rap sheet of yours And when she
finds out what a piece of shit
drug dealing pervert you really
are she won’t want anything more
to do with you

Michael’s demeanor suddenly changes knowing that DeSantis
has his number

DESANTIS
Don’t think for one second you’re
smarter than me

Michael laughs and shakes his head in disbelief

MICHAEL
Darcy told me to watch out for you
She said you were tricky I guess
this means we’re partners again

DeSantis slowly walks over to Michael He gets in his face
Michael is seemingly intimidated by this

DESANTIS
I want it done tonight I don’t
care how you do it But she
doesn’t leave this town alive

MICHAEL
Whatever you say detective

DeSantis returns to his car and gets in He drives off
kicking up the desert sand behind him

Michael watches as DeSantis continues down the desert road
He stands watching -- as the car becomes invisible

Michael sits silent -- knowing where DeSantis is taking this

DeSantis sits silent -- gazing intimidatingly

MICHAEL (contd)
Then she tells me about how you
just show up at her place at odd
hours asking her questions about
who she’s been talking to The
only thing that’s keeping her from
going to the cops is the fact she’s
scared shitless of you

DESANTIS
Okay Michael I want you to
listen carefully If IA shows up
on my doorstep asking a bunch of
questions about stolen money I’m
gonna assume either you or Darcy
talked I’m also gonna assume you
lied to me You know the rest

DeSantis lays down a manila envelope on the table and stands
to leave

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
There’s another ten grand if you
decide there’s something else I
should know about I hope you do
the right thing A lot of innocent
lives may depend on your decision
I’‘ll see you around

It is filled with loose bills about 10000

Michael

DESANTIS
Don’t shoot I’m allergic

Michael continues to point his weapon at DeSantis

DESANTIS
I figured out a way to help Darcy’s
old man But I’m gonna need your
help Yours and Darcy’s

MICHAEL
Why the hell would I do that

DESANTIS
Because you’re in love with her
If there’s anything I can do
Darcy Isn’t that what you told
her right before she cried herself
to sleep in your arms

A sore subject for Michael He puts the hammer back on his
weapon and places it back in his coat He continues into the
kitchen and begins emptying his groceries

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
I know you wanna help her Michael
Well I’m giving you the chance
Might be your only chance of
getting her back You can either
take it or you can continue to be a
miserable sack of shit

Michael stops in his tracks -- completely taken by surprise

DESANTIS
What did I tell you about thinking
you’re smarter than me Michael
You and I both knew there was only
one thing that could come from you
taking me to see Darcy’s body
Either you kill me or I kill you

Michael is frozen with fear He can’t take his eyes off of
DeSantis’ gun

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
You played it cool in Utah when I
gave you that fifty grand in funny
money But you played it off You
did the right thing and kept your
mouth shut You wanted to wait
until my guard was down to come
take my money So let me see if I
can get this straight

Michael turns his attention from the gun to DeSantis
DESANTIS (CONT’D)
---You never killed Darcy And not

that cunt were gonna run off with
my money together

DeSantis points his gun at Michael

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
Where is she

MICHAEL
If I tell you you’1l kill me

DeSantis cocks the weapon and points it at Michael’s
genitals

MICHAEL
I can take you to her I can still
do it I can kill her if you want

DeSantis slowly lowers his gun

DESANTIS
Good Very good Michael You

chance

Michael lets out a huge sigh of relief -- giggles nervously
MICHAEL

hand

DeSantis drives the knife into Michael’s gut -- retracts
then once more as Michael drops to the floor He spits up
blood onto the cold hard tile and grabs his gut in pain

DeSantis yanks a hand towel from a nearby rack and tosses it
to Michael

DESANTIS
Put some pressure on the wound

four hours when I broke the news to
her She blamed me for what

selfish But she always was a
spoiled little bitch

DeSantis kicks Michael in his wounded stomach He SCREAMS
out in agony

The detective reaches down and runs his hand through
Michael’s pockets He pulls out a MOTEL ROOM KEY

DESANTIS (CONT’D)
(staring at the key)
What’s this Michael Room 101

are hiding

Michael once again SCREAMS out in agony

tried to fuck me didn’t I Now

A real life living piece of shit
dies next to my toilet The irony

MICHAEL

upstanding citizen Tell you what

the slide -- cocking the weapon He ejects the clip and
rests the gun on the bathroom sink

In case the pain’s a little too

serious is it

Several doctors enter and wheel Mr Gold’s bed out of the

A tear falls down Mrs Gold’s face as she watches them wheel
her husband to surgery

The Golds sit on their couch holding hands Across from
them sits Darcy -- who is anxiously awaiting an answer

MR GOLD
Your mother and I noticed something
was wrong a few months ago There
was some changes in my behavior I
started feeling tired Real tired
Then we noticed some yellow
discoloration on my skin She
thought I might have jaundice so I
went for a physical The doc said
my liver was abnormally large so he
did a biopsy He discovered that I
have fibrosis

DARCY
Cirrhosis

MR GOLD
Right I keep forgetting you play
a nurse on TV The doc says I’ve
got some scar tissue that’s
blocking the normal flow of blood
through my liver It’s caused a
lot of complications I have what’s
called coagulopathy

(MORE)

MR GOLD (contd)
It’s a type of hypertension that’s
causing my blood to clot They’ve
put me on Vitamin K and a few other
meds to try and un-clot the blood

DARCY
That’s why the nose bleeds

MR GOLD
Right

DARCY
And you’re gonna need a liver
transplant

MR GOLD (V0)
I didn’t want to tell you like
this butI’m afraid thatI’m
currently not eligible for the
transplant

MRS GOLD (V0)
What

MR GOLD (V0)
Our HMO is refusing to cover the
costs of the transplant They’re
saying with my history of drinking
I’m too big a risk for the
operation

DARCY (V0)
I don’t understand You’ve been
sober for five months

MR GOLD (V0
The pre-operation costs alone are
240000 That’s just to make me
eligible for the operation That’s
not counting the actual transplant
and the post-op care All
together this will cost around
750000

DARCY (VO)
Dad you’re kidding right Please
tell me this is one big joke

Mr Gold sifts through the mail an discovers a letter from
