enthusiastic audience applauds

HUTCH DAVIS
I’m Hutch Davis and we’re live from
Hollywood just moments away from
crowning our season champion We’ve
just seen the last dances from our
first two finalists NFL
Quarterback Tom Brady

night This season’s feisty
underdog

ANGLE ON - TOP OF THE STAGE STAIRS
Where JULES BAXTER (30s fit pretty intense) and her
partner EVAN WEBB (clearly younger than her smoldering but
doesn’t take himself seriously) wait for their introduction

She anxiously looks down at her lime green costume

JULES
I look like Mardi Gras on acid

EVAN
And I’m wearing a mesh shirt
It’s all part of the competition

JULES
Why did I let them spray-tan me
I look nuclear Like I could power
a small city

EVAN
You look beautiful And only a tiny
bit orange

Jules smiles calms down a little Then -

JULES
OK Let’s win this thing

He nods gives her a squeeze as —

HUTCH DAVIS
--So here she is in her final
dance everyone’s favorite tough-
love trainer from the weight loss
show ‘Lose It And Weep’ Jules
Baxter and her partner Evan Webb

LIGHTS GO UP MUSIC BLASTS And Jules pulls it together as
she and Evan launch into their free-style DANCE

They run down the stairs and jump onto the stage

Evan spins Jules to him Their chemistry is undeniable
Transcending the bad spray tans and ridiculous costumes

They tear through their moves - doing a little Cha-cha
shaking and shimmying their hips rolling together as -
INT STARTER APARTMENT - EVENING

We PULL OUT FROM A TV where THREE GIRLS (MOLLY COURTNEY and
ROSIE all 22) watch from a shitty post-grad apartment

COURTNEY
No way That’s just a rumor

MOLLY
How dare you question the sage
insights of US Weekly

Molly frisbees an US WEEKLY at Courtney It features a
SNAPSHOT of Jules and Evan holding coffee cups with the
headline - “SECRET COUPLE OFF THE DANCE FLOOR”

Rosie buttons her CHEF JACKET grabs her bag as she watches
Evan and Jules dancing on TV -

little audience participation

They playfully sit on the laps of a couple in the front row -

step into the living room -

NATE

HOLLY

VOLUME to torture Nate as he walks away And we -

DISSOLVE BACK TO THE STUDIO

Where Evan spins Jules in a final harrowing lift then drops
her into a split as the music ends with a dramatic punch

THE AUDIENCE JUMPS UP a STANDING OVATION Jules and Evan
hug soaking up the love

HUTCH DAVIS
Whoa Even I need a cold shower
after that one I dunno folks did
Tom Brady just get sacked Let’s
see what our judges have to say

Hutch turns Jules and Evan to the JUDGE’S TABLE where a trio
DANCE EXPERTS weigh in
ANDRE (30s a hyperbolic queen who can barely stay in his
seat) starts off -

JUDGE ANDRE
Jules darling When you started
this season you had the heart of a
competitor but the feet of a
school girl in need of corrective
shoes I never expected to see you
in the finals But you stubborn
little minx you You fought for
it and tonight you were a vixen
making a meal out of your man out
there This place needs a new roof -
because you two just blew it off
Two words Dance Gasm

Everyone cheers as the next judge KELLY (30s) nods

JUDGE KELLY

Exactly Jules on your show you
inspire people to lose weight and
change their lives But it’s just
as inspiring to see you challenge
yourself And it doesn’t hurt that
you met your match in Evan there

(Jules and Evan smile)
You two are peaking at just the
right moment

More cheers as the final judge DALTON (60s stuffy) shrugs

JUDGE DALTON
Frankly I found the whole thing to
be a bit vulgar It’s like I was
practically in the bedroom with you
two

The audience BOOS Jules and Evan share a quick glance

HUTCH DAVIS
OK Judges let’s see those scores -

JUDGE ANDRE
(holds up his score card)
TEN

JUDGE KELLY

arguing with Jules - (close to 7 months now) - as the crew
and the remaining 6 contestants all watch whispering

EVAN
Jules just let me have this OK
6000 years of tradition my
cultural identity Why is this such
a big deal to you

JULES
Because I don’t think it’s right
And I don’t care if it sounds
crazy I’m his mother

EVAN
And I’m his father Parenthood is
about compromise

JULES
So compromise Evan

EVAN
I have I’m the one who moved into
your house And I loved my condo

JULES
What about me I’m sacrificing my
entire body for this

EVAN
So that means you just get to win
every argument We’ll “discuss it”
means Jules just gets her way

(she smiles - sure)

No I’m not that guy And we’re not
going to parent like that We’re in
this together

JULES
Look Evan In every relationship

lays eyes on her target

JULES (CONTD)
You Drop the Taco

Someone turns and it’s Colin who jumps when he sees Jules

COLIN
Aargh Jules Hi I uh -

Colin realizes he’s being filmed Jules takes his lunch and
starts inspecting it -

JULES
OK Mr Cooper let’s see what we
have here High fat high carbs

Colin Colin Colin Don’t you
remember this guy

Jules holds up a PHOTO of the old FAT COLIN from when he was
a contestant on ‘Lose It And Weep’ He’s unrecognizable in
his fat-dude goatee Colin shudders

JULES (CONT’D)
You don’t want to go back to that

do you

COLIN
No Jules this is just a one-time
thing

JULES

Really Because we’ve been doing
some recon for a little while now
Colin -

Jules shows him surveillance photos of him secretly hitting
the food trucks Colin starts to get a little defensive -

COLIN
- I’m just My wife is pregnant
and as you probably know Jules
it is very common for male partners
to put a little weight on too It’s
actually called “Couvade Syndrome”
or “Sympathetic Pregnancy” The
term couvade is borrowed from the
French verb “couver” to brood or
to hatch -

JULES
- Colin shut up That’s a crutch
(a beat)
What’s the real issue Colin
Because you have to deal with that
today not a hundred pounds from
now

Colin nods starting to get a little emotional

COLIN
I know It’s just I didn’t
expect pregnancy would bring up all
my childhood issues

JULES
I know it’s like suddenly
because you have this belly
everyone gets to have an opinion
about your baby and before you
know it this blessed miracle that
you didn’t even think could happen
is reduced to one big penis joke
And hey - I like penis jokes as
much as the next girl but someone -
anyone - just ask me a about the
name and what I’m craving

Colin just stares at her Jules stops Then -

JULES (CONT’D)
Right And so we’re gonna deal with
this in a healthy way right
Colin
(Colin slowly nods)
Say ‘I’m worth it’

COLIN
I’m worth it

JULES
Say ‘I can do this’

COLIN
I CAN DO THIS

JULES
There you go Now let’s do a few
lunges right now you and me

Colin nods and starts lunging Jules lunges but now she’s so
pregnant she goes down and can’t get back up -

JULES (CONTD)
OK I’m gonna need a little help

The crew rushes in to help Jules up But she suddenly winces
in fierce pain

JULES (CONTD)
Don’t touch me

COLIN
We need a doctor

Skyler in a cute pregnancy bikini hangs with her FRIENDS
near the pool all getting pedicures She waves Trish over

Trish brightens - she could use a foot massage - and waddles
over with her TUMS

Trish plops in a chair sticks her feet out They are hugely
fat compared to Skyler’s little feet

Ramsey watches Trish then smiles playfully to Colin -

RAMSEY
You sure Trish isn’t having twins
(off Colins look)
Whoa hey Just kidding

Ramsey walks off to entertain Colin looks down at a platter
of cupcakes going by He almost takes one but walks over to
Margaritaville instead -

RAMSEY’S FRIENDS (50-something retired guys who also favor
the Tommy Bahama look) crowd around the bar

RAMSEY’S FRIEND

RAMSEY
- I won He couldn’t take it

COLIN
He cheated He started telling me I
had a bad tire waving for me to
pull over Then when I slowed down
he sped past me

RAMSEY
Just a little lesson in
gamesmanship

(Colin quietly seethes)
It’s like I told you your whole
life Col The old man’s always
gonna be numero uno But hey
numero dos ain’t bad either

COLIN
No Dad You haven’t told me that
my whole life Because you weren’t
there You just show up and throw
money around But Mom did the work

Colin gets up starts walking off leaving his drink

RAMSEY
What are you doing Son You don’t
walk away from a fresh margarita

COLIN
I’m not supposed to drink my
calories And I need some air

As Colin crosses the party he sees Trish on the other side
of the pool eyes closed in bliss as she gets a foot massage

Colin keeps walking exiting the backyard to the golf course
and some peace He looks at Ramsey’s parked golf carts

BACK WITH RAMSEY

He shakes his head letting Colin go Then turns to find
himself face-to-face with Skyler who’s had enough

SKYLER
Ramsey Cooper you put your drink
down and get your ass out there and
fix what needs fixing Now

RAMSEY
Aw c’mon Tater Tot -
