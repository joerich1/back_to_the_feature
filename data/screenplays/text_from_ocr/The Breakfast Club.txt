There are six tables in two rows of three
Claire is sitting at the front table Brian comes in
and sits at the table behind her

Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
at the front table She shrugs and he sits there

In walks Bender he touches everything on the checkout
desk and takes a few things in the process

He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
the table on the opposite side of the Library Brian
reluctantly gets up and moves

Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
feet up

Allison walks in She walks all the way around the
library and sits in the back corner table just behind
Brian

Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker
Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away
Enter RICHARD VERNON a teacher He holds a stack

of papers in his left hand He addresses the group with
such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
job

VERNON
Wellwell Here we are I want
to congradulate you for being on
time

Claire raises her hand

CLAIRE
Excuse me sir I think theres
been a mistake I know its
detention butumI dont think
I belong in here

Vernon doesnt care He just continues to talk

VERNON
It is now seven-oh-six You have
exactly eight hours and fifty-four
minutes to think about why youre
here To ponder the error of your
ways

Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
mouth again

Claire looks like she is going to gag

VERNON
and you may not talk You will
not move from these seats

He glances up at Bender and points at him

VERNON
»and you

Vernon pulls the chair out from under Benders feet

VERNON
-will not sleep Alright people
were gonna try something a little
different today We are going to
write an essay--of no less than a
thousand words--describing to me
who you think you are

BENDER
Is this a test

Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
of Bender

VERNON
And when I say essayI mean essay

a thousand times Is that clear Mr
Bender

Bender looks up

BENDER

VERNON

something about yourself Maybe

Vernon leaves

BENDER

Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
snapping sound Brian turns and looks and it is
Allison biting her nails

Benders eyes widen as he turns to look Everyone is
looking now Allison notices them looking at her

BENDER
You keep eating your hand and youre
not gonna be hungry for lunch

Allison spits part of her nail at Bender

BENDER

We see Vernon look out from his office
We see Brian playing with his pen

BRIAN
(quietly to himself)
Who do I think I am Who are you
Who are you

He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
under his upper lip

BRIAN
I am a walrus

Bender looks at him in utter confusion Brian notices
this laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
embarrassed

Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
same time They both notice this Brian stops removing
his jacket

Bender takes his all the way off Brian rubs his hands
together and pretends to be cold He pulls his jacket
back on He turns and looks at Bender who is still
staring at him

BRIAN

Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
laugh

Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper He
throws it at Claire It misses and goes over Claires

head

Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore

Bender

Bender starts loudly singing the musical part of a

song “Nah nah nah nah nah nahnah nah

mouthyou unload all these
tremendous lies all over me

ANDREW

any less bizarre

ANDREW

pretty bizarre Some of us are just
better at hiding it thats all

CLAIRE
(to Andrew)
How are you bizarre

Allison decides to field that question

ANDREW
Well then you know how hairy he is
right Well when they pulled the
tape off most of his hair came off

And the bizarre thing is is that
I did it for my old manI
tortured this poor kid because I
wanted him to think that I was cool
Hes always going off about you

the wild things he used to do And
I got the feeling that he was
disappointed that I never cut loose
on anyone rightSo ImIm
sitting in the locker room and Im
taping up my knee And Larrys
undressing a couple lockers down
from me Yeahhes kinda
hes kinda skinny weak And I
started thinking about my father
and his attitude about weakness
And the next thing I knew I uh I
jumped on top of him and started
wailing on himAnd my friends
they just laughed and cheered me on
And afterwards when I was sittin
in Vernons office all I could
think about was Larrys father And
Larry havin to go home andand
explain what happened to him And
the humiliationfucking
humiliation he mustuv felt It
mustuv been unrealI mean

(hes crying)
I mean how do you apologize for
something like that Theres no
wayits all because of me and

No

BRIAN
So so on Mondaywhat happens

CLAIRE
Are we still friends you mean
If were friends now that is

BRIAN

CLAIRE
Do you want the truth

BRIAN
Yeah I want the truth

CLAIRE
I dont think so

ALLISON
Well do you mean all of us or just
John

CLAIRE

With all of you

ANDREW
Thats a real nice attitude Claire
CLAIRE
Oh be honest Andyif Brian came
walking up to you in the hall on
Monday what would you do I mean
picture this youre there with all
the sports I know exactly what
youd do youd say hi to him and
when he left youd cut him all up
so your friends wouldnt think you
really liked him

ANDREW
No way

ALLISON
Kay what if I came up to you

CLAIRE
Same exact thing

BENDER
(furious and screaming at Claire)
You are a bitch

CLAIRE
Why Cause Im telling the truth
that makes me a bitch

BENDER
No Cause you know how shitty that
is to do to someone And you dont
got the balls to stand up to your
friends and tell em that youre
gonna like who you wanna like

CLAIRE
Okay what about you you hypocrite
Why dont you take Allison to one of
your heavy metal vomit parties Or
take Brian out to the parking lot at
lunch to get high What about Andy
for that matter what about me
What would your friends say if we
were walking down the hall together
Theyd laugh their asses off and
youd probably tell them you were
doing it with me so theyd forgive
you for being seen with me

BENDER
(furious once again)
Dont you ever talk about my
friends You dont know any of my
friends you dont look at any of my
friends and you certainly wouldnt
condescend to speak to any of my
friends so you just stick to the
things you know shopping nail
polish your fathers BMW and your
poor--rich--drunk mother in the

Carribean
CLAIRE
(furious and sobbing)
Shut up
BENDER

And as far as being concerned about
whats gonna happen when you and I
walk down the hallways at school

you can forget it ‘Cause its never
gonna happen Just bury your head

in the sandand wait for your
fuckin prom

CLAIRE
