their intertwined destinies and the
world will be cleansed as a result

round Mike’s feet covering the floor

SALT
Either way It doesn’t matter to me

ZYKOV
Doesn’t it

love to murder those who do not

cheek with the back of his hand

ZYKOV (CONTD)

is mine a possession for all time

The water at Mike’s waist

ZYKOV (CONTD)
Do you think you ever had her You
were merely a plaything A surrogate
for her loneliness

Zykov truly a nasty sinister piece of work He runs his
hand casually down her body

ZYKOV (CONTD)
She has always been mine Her mouth
Her tongue I taught her to use
them I taught her to love What you
felt was me

As Zykov leans in to kiss Salt’s throat it gives Mike a
chance to glance up above then back at her The water at
his chest

ZYKOV (CONTD)
She is the monster I created

As Zykov drills Mike with a look Salt has a moment to glance
above where Mike tried to direct her

WHAT SHE SEES

Caught in a flash of light a SPIDER sitting in a LARGE WEB

SALT

Looks back down at

MIKE

The water up just under his chin The slightest flare in his
eyes He’s trying to tell her something

SALT

Neutral At least she appears so as Zykov watches her We
don’t know if the message has been passed or not

CATWALK

The waters creeps up Mike’s cheeks He tilts his head back
but still keeps his eyes on her

Salt stares back One last moment before the water swallows
him up

At a nod from Zykov the gangster pulls the handle shutting
off the water Just a few inches above Mike’s upturned face

A frozen beat before bubbles erupt from Mike’s mouth and nose
in sudden tortured bursts

And Salt witnesses every moment A beholder And Zykov
watches her as

Mike’s hands break the surface as he flails Finally a last
silent scream his mouth dark and wide Until Death claims
him And his body settles away into the murk below

Salt turns looks frankly to Zykov Then kisses Zykov on
the mouth Even Basayev raises an eyebrow Salt pulls back

The President flips through a set of SATELLITE THERMAL
IMAGING as Miller points out

MILLER
These are temperature-drops in mobile
missile units across the Kaliningrad
Oblast and in southern Baikal

PRESIDENT
What exactly does that mean

SEC DEF CHALMERS
It means Barisovsky has the Russians
fueling their rockets We assume you
don’t gas up unless you’re getting
ready to go

As it settles on the President a beat the First Lady steps
up She’s very aware she’s interrupting something heavy

FIRST LADY
I’m going to the screening room for a
movie Okay

He squeezes her hand nods A beat between them and she goes

PRESIDENT
So what do we do

MILLER
Even if they’re posturing the only
meaningful response will be our own
ICBM’s being fueled The Russians
will read it and notice will be
served

SEC DEF CHALMERS
We should put some planes in the air
surface move a submarine or two and
open some silo doors That and go
from Defcon 4 to Defcon 3 At least
at our forward bases

BLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires three shots in about a second
At Winter Who just stands there a foot from the glass

He looks at three slugs that should have slammed through his
head but are now embedded in the very bullet-proof glass
As he looks back to her

SALT
You told Zykov didn’t you About

to be tested

Winter taps the glass by the bullets with his finger

PEABODY
Cigarette

He offers from a pack She takes one As he lights it

PEABODY (CONT’D)
Someone stopped the missile launch
The president was unconscious That
means it was either you or Winter
And the President says Winter started
it So

She doesn’t answer

PEABODY (CONT’D)
Did you save the world Salt

She still doesn’t answer

PEABODY (CONT’D)
If so who did you save it from

SALT
Them

PEABODY
Define ‘them’

She doesn’t answer finally

SALT
Me

She looks up at some fixed spot above and past him Looks
about as sad as can be

PEABODY
Listen Salt Winter we can figure
out He led a life he left a trail
We’ll trace it back We will fucking
dissect him if we have to But
Zykov’s still out there We may have
a chance to get him before he leaves
the country

She’s CRYING now Finally really crying even though she’s
from Grozny As she looks at whatever she’s focused on

Peabody looks back over his shoulder

High up the CHICKEN WIRE GLASS was struck at some point in
the past A roundish “SPIDER-WEBBED” crack radiates out

SALT
(still looking)
They killed my husband And I
watched and I did nothing Because
of that goddamn vow I took

PEABODY
What Some KGB vow

SALT
CIA Remember Country duty and
the greater fucking good
(a painful beat)
I guess I’m wired that way

PEABODY
Where’d they do it Where’d they
kill Mike Tell me so I can go after
Zykov

SALT
You know why Mike liked spiders It
was the webs He knew everything
about webs He even memorized this
poem And taught it to me
(finally looks at him)
You want to hear it

PEABODY
(humoring her)
Sure

Salt wipes her eyes starts so softly

SALT
The spider dropping down from twig
unfolds a plan of her devising a
thin premeditated rig to use in
rising And all that journey down
through space in cool descent and
loyal hearted she spins a ladder to
the place from where she started
Thus I gone forth as spiders do in
spiders web a truth discerning
attach one silken thread to you for
my returning

And despite all his stoic professionalism Peabody’s heart
breaks a little for Salt

She squeezes her eyes shut mourning body wracked but no
sound coming out As she gets control again

SALT (CONTD)
It’s a love poem you see He told me
that every time I saw a spider web
every time I should remember how
much he loved me

Now we know what Mike told her before he died

She points back at the spider-webbed glass

SALT (CONTD)
Once you stop looking for them you
see them everywhere

PEABODY
I’m sorry about him Salt

She accepts it with a nod doesn’t say anything

PEABODY (CONT’D)
But Zykov Give me something

SALT
His name’s not really Zykov That’s
just what he called himself

PEABODY
Then what is it Help me

Silence Absolute dead silence And suddenly Salt’s jaw
tenses As she grits her teeth and we hear a CRACK

As Peabody reacts she smiles
SALT
They gave us all these teeth That’s
why I killed Winter So he couldn’t
do it himself
(shrugs)
Cyanide

And Salt’s eyes ROLL BACK WHITE in her head And her body is
WRACKED IN SEIZURE

PEABODY
Shit

His chair falling over as he jumps up
CUT TO
INT HALLWAY

Salt being raced down a hallway on a gurney body straining
in convulsions against the strap Peabody alongside her

As a DOCTOR joins them from an INTERSECTING HALLWAY

PEABODY
Goddamn Cyanide

CUT TO
INT OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
In she comes met by a team

DOCTOR
Hydroxocobalamin

A NURSE hands him a SYRINGE As he’s about to inject her
Salt grabs his wrist bends it back sending him howling
She faked it
Peabody stepping forward as she pulls loose the chest strap
She catches him with a knee as she rolls off the gurney
Catches him in a headlock up under his windpipe
SALT
You really care about me
(straining)
I’m touched

And she rams his head into the wall knocking him unconscious

And then she’s through the doors further into the hospital
leaving the uproar in the OR behind her

And as we PAN UP into the BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS overhead
leaving the sound to fade away we

DISSOLVE TO
THE SUN
White and unyielding PAN DOWN TO
EXT FSB HEADQUARTERS - THE KREMLIN MOSCOW - DAY
Formerly the KGB but what’s in a name
CUT TO
INT FSB HEADQUARTERS - MOSCOW RUSSIA - DAY

A wall papered with a faded floor-to-ceiling TROPICAL SCENE
A beach with a coconut palm growing out over the water

Sitting at his large pointless desk is Zykov As he sips a
cup of tea a RAP at the door

ZYKOV
Enter

The door opens An UNDERLING sticks his head in
UNDERLING

We have a walk-in Female Chinese
She asked to speak to you

ZYKOV
To me Does she speak Russian
As the underling shrugs

UNDERLING
Tolerably

CUT TO
INT HALLWAY - - DREARY GOVERNMENT OFFICE - DAY
Carrying his tea Zykov stops at the door looks through a
little window set in it A WOMAN sits at the familiar little
table head bowed black hair in a tight bun

Zykov enters sets down his teacup and sits across from her

ZYKOV
How can I help you

No answer Zykov frowns Suddenly doesn’t like being in
here with whoever this is He subtly reaches under the desk

ANGLE UNDERNEATH

As he presses a BUTTON under there He can’t see that the
wires have been torn out

ROOM
The Chinese woman finally speaks

HER VOICE
Its been disabled

She looks up Chinese though perhaps on the Eurasian side
Of course Zykov recognizes EVELYN SALT when he sees her

A nervous beat then

ZYKOV
Have you come to kiss the ring

She shakes her head No she hasn’t Something ferocious
about her Something vibrant

SALT
I’ve come to tell you that I’m free

But he looks weary and past it And as Zykov suddenly moves
to stand

Salt leaps the table a WAR CRY on her lips as

TIME SLOWS DOWN

Zykov falling back Salt in midair Her hands like talons
reaching for his throat just inches away

Moving forward in increments

We hear the sound of a jet plane landing A Boeing 707
BOAC in fact The guitar starts

It’s Back in the USSR by the Beatles and this day is not
going to end well for Comrade Zykov

PAUL MCCARTNEY
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC didn’t
get to bed last night On the way
the paper bag was on my knee man I
had a dreadful flight -- Im back in
the USSR

And just as her hands reach his throat
FADE OUT

The End
