EXT PARTY - LOCAL RANCH - NIGHT

A big party is in progress Joan and Lizzie are the center of
attention dancing up a storm Lizzie dances with Pablo while
Joan dances with his two friends They are having the time of
their lives

LIZZIE
(To Joan)
I never knew I could have so much fun
without William

Lizzies wig slips a little as she bounces to the beat Joan
reaches over straightening it

JOAN
Wonders never cease

EXT PARTY - LATER ON

Blindfolded Lizzie swings at a pinata that hangs from a tree
Everyone laughs as she misses and lands on her ass

INT TRUCK - LATER THAT NIGHT

(CONTTNUED )

The truck bounces along a lonely dirt road the only light is
that of the moon Lizzie Joan and Pablo sing Guantanamera
Pablos arm is around Lizzies shoulder She seems to be
enjoying it

There is a BIG BANG The truck BACKFIRES and SHAKES Pablo
swears

EXT LONELY DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

The truck is pulled over to the side of the road The two women
watch as Pablo heads off with a gas can ANIMAL NOISES are HEARD
in the distance They share a look

INT CAB OF TRUCK - LATER ON

Lizzie looks at her watch then out into the darkness worried

LIZZIE
What if he gets lost

JOAN
He wont

A shiver runs through Lizzie as a wolf HOWLS in the distance

LIZZIE
Was that a wolf

JOAN
Dont think about it

LIZZIE
It sure is dark in here

Joan rummages around in her bag She pulls out a flashlight and
sets it on the dash

JOAN
Im earthquake trained

OS Of another long howl Lizzie motions to Joans handbag

LIZZIE
Dont suppose you have a radio in there
or any other source of entertainment

Joan shakes her head no looking away After a moment she gets
an idea She picks up the flashlight and waves it around the
cab HUMMING the introduction to a circus act followed by

JOAN
(Like a radio announcer)
Live from the outback of Acapulco The
Dirt Road Saloon presents The Joan
Diamond Show

(CONTTNUED )

Lizzie claps as Joan bows She holds her hand in front of the
beam making different shadow animal images on the seat next to
Lizzie

She moves it around the cab of the truck until A RABBIT plays
on top of Lizzies shoulder Lizzie laughs

Joan looks at Lizzie a long moment then

JOAN (contd)
Once upon a time there was this ugly
little rabbit who lived in a trailer
park

We see a rabbit hopping along the back of the seat behind
Lizzies head The rabbits ears go cock-eyed

JOAN (contd)
(continuing)
She worked day and night to beautify and
educate herself in order that she might
some day attract a Rabbit Prince

Joan puts the flashlight on the dash so she can make two rabbits
with each of her hands On the other side of Lizzie we now see
another rabbit The Prince Both rabbits do a flirtatious
dance until finally they kiss

JOAN (contd)
She did and fell deeply in love

JOAN (contd)
(continuing)
When it came time to marry the Prince
informed her that he needed a real
Princess to rule his kingdom not her

Lizzies smile fades The rabbits stop kissing One rabbit puts
her head down distraught and slowly hops away

JOAN (contd)
(continuing)
She tried and tried to no avail to let
go of the Prince

The rabbit stops and hops back to the other rabbit then leaves
and hops back etc

JOAN (contd)
(continuing)
She even talked herself into believing
that she was happy living this way that
marriage wasnt for her She convinced
herself of this for years

The rabbit stops

(CONTTNUED )

JOAN (contd)
But the truth be known she longed to
marry Each and every promise gave her
hope that marriage was to come her way
(naked)
But it never did

Joan puts her hands down Lizzies eyes search Joans After a
moment she makes her decision

LIZZIE
-Well I once knew this Princess rabbit
who grew up in a big mansion being the
focus and envy of everybody

Joan watches her solemnly

LIZZIE (contd)
(continuing)
The Princess had this powerful father
who told her she would never be able to
satisfy a rabbit like himself because
she like her mother wasnt beautiful
enough

Joan listens

LIZZIE (contd)

(continuing)
You see her father had numerous
mistresses while married to her mother
And knowing of her mothers pain she
vowed this would never happen to her She
would find a man of honor a man that she
alone would fulfill

Joans face fills with guilt

LIZZIE (contd)

(Continuing)
So she searched far and wide and one day
a Prince suddenly appeared He courted
her they fell in love married and were
very happy

(beat)
At times paranoia swept through her
making her wonder if she was good enough
But she never acted on it out of respect
for her marriage and kids After all she
was truly in love He was married to her
And most important she had broken her
fathers prophecy

Lizzie turns to Joan whose face teams with sorrow Their hearts
breaking for each other Silence They hold one another

After a moment OS of FOOTSTEPS Joan shuts off the flashlight
as Pablo opens the door

(CONTTNUED )
