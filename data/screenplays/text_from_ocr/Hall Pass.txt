Im just saying maybe a little
freedom would be good for them And
for you

(BEAT)
Have you ever considered giving
them a hall pass

GRACE
A what

DR LUCY

A hall pass A week off from
marriage

Grace and Maggie stop chewing

MAGGIE
Wait a minute Are you saying let
them go out and cheat

DR LUCY
Im saying give them a week off
from marriage

(BEAT)
Look most married men have foggy
memories of their single days and
they somehow get under the
impression that if not for you
theyd be able to be with ail those
women who entice them

GRACE

Thats Fred He thinks because he
sees big tits everywhere and then
still comes home for dinner that I
should be welcoming him at the door
like some conquering hero

Dr Lucy smiles

DR LUCY

Well maybe its time to let them
go out there and find out what its
really like

MAGGIE
Wow Youre talking about the
nuclear option
Maggie ponders the idea

GRACE
And remind me again what good
could possibly come from this

DR LUCY

Theres a wonderful principle in
psychology called reactance
theory It basically states that
if youre constantly told you cant
do something you want to do it
more than ever And conversely if
you remove the taboo you remove
the obsession

Grace makes a t sound

GRACE

(SARCASTIC)
I got an idea Doc Why dont you
try a hall pass out on your husband
and let us know how it works out

DR LUCY
Oh I have
Grace and Maggie REACT to this

MAGGIE
Youre telling us you let Charlie
sleep with another woman
Dr Lucy takes a moment before answering

DR LUCY

I am not telling you that I am
telling you that I gave him the
freedom to choose for himself

GRACE
And
DR LUCY
All I know isour marriage is

better than ever
Grace and Maggie think about this

GRACE

I dont know Theres a reason that
men evolved and apes didnt Its
because women demanded more
Without a wife Einstein wouldve
been humping a maple tree all day
As the women LAUGH we

EXT ED and KIMMY LONGS ESTATE - DAY

There are several flashy cars out front of this huge
McMansion As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of
Freds mini-van Ed Long comes out of the house to greet
them (Eds 5-YEAR-OLD SON is beside him wearing khakis and
Polo shirt just like his father)

GRACE
There he is The lord of the manor

ED
Come on everyone in the shack The
grand tours about to begin

INT STUDY - AFTERNOON

Ed and his wife KIMMY (late-30s high-maintenance) lead
Rick Fred Maggie Grace and SEVERAL OTHER GUESTS into a
large wood-paneled study (The Longs 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
sticks to her mothers side WEARING A MATCHING DRESS)

ED
I call it headquarters
LARRY BOHAC mid-40s and his blonde bombshell of a wife
MANDY (who wears A TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT) look around in awe

MANDY
Un-believable

ED
Thats sweet of you to say Mandy

LARRY
Its epic Ed
Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR

ED

(RE HUMIDOR)
And this over here--this is the war
room The temperature in there
never goes above fifty-four
degrees never below fifty-three I
even threw in a back-up generator
in case we lose power and the main
generator doesnt kick in Now who

trip to Havana

KIMMY

opulence Grace and Maggie cant help but be impressed

hundred and forty large it better
be paradise
Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently POUNDS IT Just
then Grace NOTICES that Fred has disappeared

GRACE

INT ANOTHER PART OF THE UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Rick walks down a hall and finds Fred in a guest room
watching a baseball game on TV

RICK

FRED

(DEFENSIVE)
I thought youd want to watch a
movie in a mini-van You never got

WALL BEHIND THEM

MAGGIE

KIMMY

I think having a safe room is a bit
over the top but Ed feels with our
two little ones you can never be
too cautious

GRACE
Aw youre such a good daddy

MAGGIE
(aside to Grace)
Rick cant even set up the baby
monitors right
Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred ENTER the

the master bathroom doorway and look in

RICK (ON MONITOR)

INT RICK and MAGGIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while Maggie
stands across from him rubbing her temples It looks like
the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her
little boy for sneaking a frog into the house

MAGGIE
You know what really troubles me
The thing that youre all so
obsessed with is meaningless to
you Its really just about numbers
with you guys
Rick looks up confused

MAGGIE (CONTD)

Rick you cant even tel me the

month you lost your virginity I

can tell you the exact day and hour
that I lost mine

Rick seems a little embarrassed by this

RICK
Well virginity is different for
guys

MAGGIE

The point is obviously I like sex
too--it means something to me--but
I dont walk around gawking at
every guy I see
RICK
All right so I occasionally notice
other women Im sorry

MAGGIE
Occasionally
Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come
clean

RICK
Okay you want the truth You
really want me to pull back the
curtain here From the moment I
leave the house in the morning til
the moment I get home I pretty
much notice every woman in my path
Maggie turns to face him

RICK (CONTD)
But its not how you think it is
Mags Its like its like a
curse I dont want to notice but
I cant help it Its always been
like that I figured that when I
c jot married that would be it but
it wasnt--the thingdoesnt give
two shits about marriage

MAGGIE

(HURT)
So what are you saying--youre not
happy with our sex life
Rick reaches up and takes her hand

RICK
No Of course Im happy honey--our
sex life is great--not that I
wouldnt mind a little more but--
look one thing has nothing to do
with the other I think about sex a
lot--all guys do--thats just the

Maggie sits down beside him clearly at the end of her rope
No one speaks for a few moments Then

MAGGIE

Grace nods

MAGGIE (CONTD)
That night when we got home Rick

tucked the kids in and I started
wondering who he would be thinking
about during sex Would it be the
girl he checked out on the way into
the party Or would it be Missy
Frankenfield--because I noticed him
gawking at her Or how about one of
the waitresses or maybe somebody
he saw at work that day Then when
he came into the room I did
something Id never done before I
pretended to be asleep

FRED

days in and the only woman Ive
spoken to was our waitress at
Outback And she never even made
eye-contact

RICK
I dont really care if some
waitress makes eye-contact I want
to go home--I miss my wife and

FRED
Let me explain something to you If
Grace and Maggie find out we cant
get laid on our own theyll start
thinking we need them to get laid
Do you know what thatll do to the
balance of power in our homes
Itll destroy it
Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed

RICK
Well what if we just tell them
that we did hook up

FRED
We cant Gracell know She always
knows when Im lying
RICK
Hey what about a massage parlor

FRED
No Thats giving up
Fred glares at him

FRED (CONTD)
You dont get it do you A hall
pass aint all about sex Its
about being man enough to pick up a
woman even though you may not be
what--in the traditional sense--is
considered
(makes quotes with

FINGERS)
-good-looking or
(finger quotes again)
-appealing
Rick seems stung by this news

FRED (CONTD)
Look if we cant show that
something positive can come from
having a hall pass then the whole
concept is dead Not just for
usbut for all mankind
Rick thinks about this for a moment then stands up with a

RENEWED SENSE OF PURPOSE

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

Fred glances back at the Old Korean Lady then WHISPERS in
the Young Korean Womans ear She nods and looks at him

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONTD)
Okay but must see ID first
Fred SIGHS and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill

FRED
How about a C-note so I dont have
to fill out any forms or show any
IDs
The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment then
SLIDES OPEN THE ACCORDION WALL behind her REVEALING
THE DRY CLEANERS NEXT DOOR - the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady
looks back at him along with Kimmy Long her daughter and

ALL THE OTHER WOMEN IN LINE

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

Gentleman want a rub-and-tug with

taking a breather

RICK COLEMAN

Maggie shrugs modestly

MAGGIE
Thanks I was a dance major in
college

RICK COLEMAN
Really I always wondered--what do
you do with a degree in dance

MAGGIE
Well as it turned out nothing

(BLUSHING)
I guess the original plan was to go
to New York and try to hook-up with
one of the big dance companies but
then I got married and your
priorities change
She looks away maybe a little embarrassed

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Anyway that was fun I havent
danced this much in a long time

RICK COLEMAN
Why not
MAGGIE
I dont know you get busy kids
school theres so much going on

RICK COLEMAN
Well you gotta make time for the
stuff you love or youll forget who
you are
Maggie appreciates the sentiment She makes strong eye-
contact with Rick for a moment but catches herself and

looks
away
MAGGIE
You know my husbands name is
Rick

Rick smiles at this

RICK COLEMAN
Well that makes me the perfect guy
to have an affair with--youd never
have to worry about screaming out
the wrong name during sex
Maggie smiles at this but she seems a nick uncomfortable

RICK COLEMAN (CONTD)

RICK COLEMAN

and get something to eat Im
starving
As they head back to the party we

CUT TO
INT RICKS TOYOTA AVALON - LATE AFTERNOON

Rick is parked across the street from FITNESS FIRM HEALTH
CLUB Hes reading the newspaper and glancing at the

entrance for Leigh Suddenly theres a LOUD TAP on the

window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at
Ricks

poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin Rick

rolls down the window

FLATS

Rick REACTS to this

FLATS (CONTD)

(BIG SMILE)
So whats the deal--you getting
laid

RICK

(DEFENSIVE)
What No

RICK (CONTD)
I dont know where youre getting
your information Flats but a hall
pass isnt just about getting laid
its about getting a week off from
marriage to do as you please--
whether that be fishing or
watching TV whatever it is that
relaxes you

FLATS

(DUBIOUS)
Oh I didnt know that
Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes)
walking down the sidewalk toward the gym

RICK
Uh Flatsy I gotta run Im late
for my work-out appointment
When Rick hops out of his car we see that hes wearing gym
shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt He hesitates then
grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS
WAIST Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh

RICK (CONTD)

Hey girl

LEIGH

(SMILING)
All right You decided to go for
it

As Rick follows Leigh into the gym a smiling Flats CALLS
OUT

FLATS

As Flats begins to LAUGH a sheepish Rick scurries into the
building

JELLY

he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS
BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS The guys continue their conversation
unfazed Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS

As Rick dries his hands he cant contain himself

RICK
Whats that about--you swimming the
English Channel
The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look

METROSEXUAL
Nah Just not into looking like the
knuckle-dragging guy on the
evolution-of-man chart
Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered
body we go

INT HOT TUB ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Rick ENTERS the empty hot tub room takes off his towel and
eases into the STEAMING WATER He hits a button and the jets
kick on FULL BLAST turning the hot tub into a BUBBLY

CAULDRON

RICK
Ohyes

He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head then
settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES

DISSOLVE TO
SAME SCENE - LATER
Rick is in a DEEP SLEEP His mouth is wide open but his head
is BARELY ABOVE WATER as he SNORES LOUDLY He dips beneath
the surface and as he begins to CHOKE and COUGH he wakes
Rick takes a moment to get his bearings then STRUGGLES to
get out of the hot tub But his MUSCLES HAVE TURNED TO

RICK
(WEAKLY)
Little help
When none comes a life-and-death STRUGGLE ensues as the
flabby middle-aged dad tries to climb to safety

RICK (CONTD)
Help me
Just as Rick starts to go under the two young naked
metrosexuals hear his MOANS and come to his rescue They
jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore As Rick GASPS for
air one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts Ricks
head onto his NAKED LAP

NAKED METROSEXUAL 1

They finally get Rick to his feet As the naked men help him
across the room we

ANGLE ON - two TANNED HAIRLESS METROSEXUAL ASSES flanking

marriage in America
Fred eats a big scoop of ice cream

FRED (CONTD)

(WITH MOUTH-FULL)
I envisioned a national holiday

holidaythat saved the institution
of marriage

RICK

Rick REACTS to this

RICK
He was talking about it at a
barbecue

PAIGE
Oh he wasnt saying it in a bad
way

PAIGE (CONTD)

classy of you to be staying at the
Holiday Inn Express instead of
bringing girls back to your home
with all the kids pictures and
schoolwork taped up everywhere
Rick forces a smile

RICK
Thank you
A male BARTENDER 25 finally appears in front of Rick

the champagne Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally
pays Then hes left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love-
with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage

LEARY

Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION

LEARY (CONTD)

and being able to do what you want
to do when you want to do it

RICK
Havent gotten laid yet huh

BOSHANE

(DISPIRITED)
Its a lot tougher than we thought
it would be

Tv

COAKLEY (CONTD)
Man that Barney Fife still kills

He looks back to Rick

COAKLEY (CONTD)
Hey I was thinking about this hall-
pass business Its really ironic
isnt it
Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned
RICK
Hows that

COAKLEY

Well think about it Theres two
inds of guys who cheat on their
wives The guy who does it behind
her back and a guy like you who
has his wifes permission

RICK
Well its not really cheating if I
have permission

COAKLEY
Yeah whatever The point is if
you asked a hundred people who the
better CJuy is ninety-nine of em
would pick you because youre
being honest--theres no deceit
involved
Rick is growing uncomfortable

COAKLEY (CONTD)
But the funny thing is the other
guy the cheater the bad guy he
has to live with all that guilt and
anxiety while his wifes running
around happy as a clam because she
doesnt know anything And you the
good guy youve got no guilt at
all because you just laid it all on
your wifes shoulders

RICK
Well I didnt really think of it

left a puddle of drool And it
didnt bother me It actually felt
good Thats when I knew I was

would just lay there and stare up
at me It was where we first got to
know each other

So Im sorry Leigh but as amazing
as I think you areI gotta go

Rick shrugs apologetically

LEIGH
Well I think you have a screw
