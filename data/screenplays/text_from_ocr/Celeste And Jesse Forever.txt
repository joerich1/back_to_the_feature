a bowl of oatmeal a bowl of berries a cup of coffee 4
neatly stacked newspapers her laptop and the television
tuned to CNN She methodically eats sips her coffee reads
the paper watches TV and surfs the internet She is

a culture vulture Jesse walks by outside his studio and

the C and J sign to Celeste She does it back
instinctively Is it weird that we hang out so much She
shakes it off and titters Shes being ridiculous its

9 INT COFFEE BEAN- MORNING 9

Celeste walks in dressed impeccably Again in all black
She is in a rush on her Blackberry bombarded with a hefty
pre-work crowd People are in some semblance of a line
waiting to order

Celeste spots a man in a business suit taking advantage of
the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of
the line He orders

BUSINESS MAN
Large coffee please

CELESTE
Excuse me sir

The business man pretends to not hear her

CELESTE (CONTD) (CONTD)
Sir You

She taps him on the arm He turns around

CELESTE (CONTD) (CONTD)
You do realize that you just cut in
front of a lot of people

BUSINESS MAN

Other people in line are now paying attention Celeste wants
to let it go but she cant

BUSINESS MAN
Well she was looking at the
pastries I didnt think she was
ready to order

CELESTE
Well its not just her Its
everyone behind her too So if you
want to ask all these people if
its okay to cut in front of them

more important than everyone
elses

The business man gets his coffee

BUSINESS MAN

CELESTE

10 INT POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-MORNING 10

Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future No walls just
large glass slabs separate the offices from each other

Celeste is on camera in the middle of conducting a live
satellite interview for MSNBC
CELESTE
American culture is dying We have
an unrelenting appetite for
processed junk food talentless pop
stars like Riley Banks and recycled
movie franchises like Transformers
The more we consume crap the more
we want crap

cut To

11 INT MSNBC STUDIOS 11
Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio

RACHEL MADDOW
Sounds utterly hopeless Is there
an upshot

CELESTE
I think there will be a groundswell
movement towards simplicity
People will start to listen to
their most rudimentary needs-- they
will crave mental spiritual and
physical nourishment Its back to
basics

RACHEL MADDOW
Wow a lot to chew on Well thanks
for being with us today Youre
great come back any time For more
on this gloomy but interesting
subject look out for trend
forecaster Celeste Martins new

just trashed her on Rachel Maddow
Great

SCOTT
Yeah thats why I wanted you to
come in Its a huge account

CELESTE

Audi because the economy is tanking
and youre afraid youll lose your
job soon You bought a Samsung cell
phone because you think it makes
you seem more business-oriented
unlike the iPhone which is for
teenage girls You go to yoga
because you went to a sub Ivy

years working long weeks and
drinking all weekend and you feel
like its time to do something

CELESTE (CONTD) (CONTD)

But the truth is I would go

tradition Every Sunday come rain

meet me and Jesse at the Bishop

the champagne of beers and we
would meet to talk about what was
important in the world you know
Heideggers influence on hip-hop
Or the feminist duality on Melrose
Place Lifes big questions Beth
and Tucker were just friends then
but there was always something
to

there Just an ease they had with
each other Jesse and I spent years
trying to get them together
unsuccessfully

(MORE)

CELESTE (CONTD) (CONTD)

But we all remained friends and
watched as Tucker dated the most
slutty vacuous and vile girls on
the planet For five long years

Tucker flinches

CELESTE (CONTD) (CONTD)

Finally he removed his head from
his ass and saw what was in front
of him And that was beautiful
Beth And none of us could be
happier about it they were
perfect At last Love wins

Wedding guests clap They think its over Its not
Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd Veronica is next to
