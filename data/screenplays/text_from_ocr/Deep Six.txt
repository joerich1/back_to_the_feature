SCREEN FLICKERS and TURNS ON IT’S A CAMCORDER LENS focuses

INT DARK APARTMENTBEDROOM - NIGHT

GRIFFIN BLACK (20’s) sits on the edge of a thrift store
futon Black mop of hair Youthful face The piercing eyes of
an old soul and a slightly manic disposition from thoughts
moving much faster than words can be formed

And he is a hot mess

Shirtless and sweating like a rockstar on a coke bender His
body is covered with ELECTRODES hooked to wires

He checks the CAMCORDER to make sure it’s recording Tries to
breath Tries to relax --

GRIFFIN

(twitchy)
Uh Hi

(rolls his eyes)
Hi What the hell is that Jesus
Starting over

(composes himself)
My name is Griffin Black It is

(looks at watch)
April 11 1225 am I am at my
apartment Lower East Side
Manhattan

He hits some keys on his LAPTOP A strange looking MACHINE
next to his bed LIGHTS UP It has THREE LONG TUBES full of
colored LIQUID He looks back into the camera lens

GRIFFIN
Tonight I’m going to die

He raises the camcorder up on the tripod and points it down
at the bed Lies down Takes a long deep breath

GRIFFIN
And I’m going to get it all on
tape

Typing laptop keys More MACHINES fire up One is a HEART
MONITOR sounding out his fast RABBIT BEATS

GRIFFIN
When my heart stops my brain can
survive for six minutes without
oxygen Then it will begin to die

Takes a beat Heart rate slows down a bit Composes himself

GRIFFIN
Doctors call this the deep six
(punches some keys)
In that time my laptop will record
everything Video vital functions
brainwave activity

Stops for a moment Takes in the gravity of what he’s saying

GRIFFIN
Time to say goodbye

Presses a KEY The strange MACHINE hisses and the first tube
EMPTIES --

GRIFFIN
I have just activated my drug
delivery mechanism

He starts to shiver uncontrollably His lips turn blue

GRIFFIN
It’s starting First drug
induces hypothermia To stop

my

His eyes roll back in his head He starts convulsing His arm
hits the laptop Knocks it to the floor THE LAPTOP SHATTERS

His jerking foot kicks the camera tripod Camera falls on its
side and picture GLITCHES going in and out of STATIC

As it captures a few blurry seconds of his feet dangling over
the edge of the bed the heart monitor --

FLATLINES

His feet go limp Picture turns to STATIC and we --
CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN

EXT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - MORNING

Ugly gray day Threatening sky The sound of another HEART
MONITOR FLATLINING is heard

OVER PICTURE “48 HOURS EARLIER”
INT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Griffin dressed in his ORDERLY UNIFORM watches from the
doorway as DOCTORS and NURSES surround an ELDERLY WOMAN
coding in her last moments of life

Doctors eventually give up and she is finally still The
doctor SWITCHES OFF the heart monitor

Griffin looks up at the ceiling above the woman for a long
beat then steps out

INT MOUNT SINAI HOSPICE CENTERPATIENT ROOM - DAY

RAYMOND TODD is staring at a CHESS BOARD Griffin walks
in and sits across from him

RAYMOND
Morning dummy

GRIFFIN
What’s up Ray

RAYMOND
Not my pecker I can tell you that
Who croaked Wilson

GRIFFIN
Nah He’s getting a haircut

RAYMOND
That uppity bitch from Queens

GRIFFIN
Her name is Katherine

Raymond looks out the window His anger softens to despair

RAYMOND
Lucky girl

He lights a joint and takes a monster hit
GRIFFIN
There’s no smoking in here You

know that Ray

RAYMOND
What do I care I’m a dead man

anyway

Griffin opens the window
GRIFFIN
The other patients don’t like it

RAYMOND
To hell with ‘em

GRIFFIN
Plus your oxygen line could
explode and blow your face off

RAYMOND
(smiles)
Now we’re talking Have to go with
a closed casket but screw it
right

Griffin allows him to take one more hit which he holds until
he’s blue in the face then Griffin puts the joint out
Raymond blows the smoke in Griffin’s face

GRIFFIN
Bishop to King 7 Check mate

Raymond looks at the chess board in disbelief Sees that it’s
legit Picks up his queen and throws it against the wall

RAYMOND
Youre a real bastard kid
Most people would let the feeble
old man dying of terminal brain
cancer win Not YOU

Griffin smiles

RAYMOND
Guess that’s why I like you dummy

Griffin sees a few TEARS running down Raymond’s face

GRIFFIN
Bad day

RAYMOND
The worst Feels like the devil
stuck a red hot poker up my ass and
shoved it into my skull

GRIFFIN
Brought you something

Griffin pulls out a sandwich baggy full of cookies
RAYMOND
What are you Betty friggin’
Crocker

GRIFFIN

Betty Crocker never baked with THC
clarified butter and Demerol laced
chocolate chips

Raymond smiles His eyes brighten in appreciation

RAYMOND
When I see Jesus I’m gonna tell
him he’s got some serious
competition

They laugh Griffin hands him a cookie and he eats it
quickly Griffin pockets the baggy and hangs out Ray starts
to relax as the drugs do their work

RAYMOND
I’m scared man

GRIFFIN
I know

RAYMOND

What the hell’s gonna happen to me
When I bite the big one

GRIFFIN
Good things You’ll see

RAYMOND
How the hell would you know You’ve
never even been laid

Griffin laughs

GRIFFIN
Trust me Think you can do that

Ray takes a deep breath and smiles as the buzz kicks in

RAYMOND
Sure Why not
(he takes Griffin’s hand)
Thanks kid You’re the only one
around here gives a shit

He starts to drift off Griffin gets up to leave Ray grabs
his hand harder
RAYMOND
Don’t leave me kid Don’t

He’s out Griffin makes sure his vitals are good then covers
him with more blankets and puts Raymond’s Queen back where it
was on the chess board when he first came in

INT BURNING HOUSE - NIGHT
FIRE EVERYWHERE CHOKING SMOKE SIRENS IN THE DISTANCE
YOUNG GIRL (0S)

HELP SOMEONE HELP ME
She is COUGHING violently
UNKNOWN POV--
Crawling on the floor desperately trying to get to the girl
There is an EXPLOSION She SCREAMS this time IN PAIN A MAN
SCREAMS with her

CUT TO

GRIFFIN--

The SCREAMS are his He is IN BED having a NIGHTMARE He
wakes up his face still filled with panic

He looks at the clock on his night stand 135 AM Next to
the clock is a FRAMED PHOTO of GRIFFIN’S FAMILY

YOUNG GRIFFIN stands with them smiling in front of
their big beautiful Cape Cod style HOME

Griffin rubs his eyes shakes out the cobwebs Sits up on the
edge of the bed --

His BACK is covered with BURN SCARS

CUT TO

INT MORGUE - NIGHT

Griffin is eating a SANDWICH on a stool while SAL GARCIA
(40s) removes the BRAIN from the open skull of a corpse
Griffin takes a closer look at the brain on the scale
SAL
I been doing this 20 years and I
can’t even think of eating in here
How the hell do you do it Griff

GRIFFIN
The smell of formaldehyde really
brings out the flavor of cold cuts

SAL
You’re loco Most people who can’t
sleep take an Ambien or something

GRIFFIN
Sleep is overrated Never was a
fan Too much to do

SAL
Like watching autopsies

GRIFFIN
I told you medicine fascinates me

SAL
So go to medical school

GRIFFIN
Already did

SAL
Reading the entire Harvard syllabus
doesn’t count

GRIFFIN
Actually it was Pathophysiology
and Clinical Diagnostics for
Dummies

Griffin throws on a pair of gloves Picks up the brain

SAL
Yo don’t be messing with that

GRIFFIN
Want to know your cause of death

SAL
I’d love it I can get home in time
for morning sex

GRIFFIN
Thanks That visual will be stuck
in my head for days
Griffin gently pulls back one of the lobes revealing a small
black spot that looks like a blood blister

GRIFFIN
Intracerebral hemorrhage Distended
vessel pushed into the brainstem
Click Out like a light Most 3rd
year residents wouldn’t have caught
that

SAL
Son you need to rotate out of this
shit orderly gig and use that brain
of yours for something better than
mopping up piss and blood

GRIFFIN
What’s the point

SAL
Here we go again
(quoting Griffin)
“Everything is meaningless anyway”

GRIFFIN
Right Besides there aren’t enough
people willing to mop

SAL
Better get yours because the
bullshit’s starting to pile up

They laugh

SAL
You need to get off this bummer
trip kid Life is beautiful

Sal goes back to his office Griffin’s smile disappears and
he stares at the corpse for a long beat

GRIFFIN
Then you die

SAL’S OFFICE--
Sal is doing some paperwork Yells out to Griffin --

SAL
Go out with my cousin Theresa
She’s your age Pretty hot But you
best mind your manners or I’1l kick
your ass You want her number
Griffin examines the corpse’s HEART Looks at Sal smiles
cynically He hasn’t even considered dating FOR A LONG TIME

GRIFFIN
Oh No thanks Not really into
dating Usually something that
complicated comes with a manual

SAL
Then how are you ever going to find
the one

Griffins thinks about it

GRIFFIN
Divine intervention Either that or
we’ll be the last two on earth
after the zombie apocalypse

DISSOLVE TO

EXT GRIFFIN’S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAWN

We see the outside for the first time-- Run down brownstone
in a very sketchy neighborhood

INT GRIFFIN’S APARTMENTLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Looks like Griffin is MOVING FURNITURE is stacked and lined
up along the wall And the FURNITURE seems out of place Too
expensive and conservative for such a bohemian apartment

Griffin is ASLEEP in front of his laptop his head resting on
his huge ornately carved DESK

MEDICAL BOOKS -- pages flagged and marked up -- are spread
out everywhere

Griffin’s door buzzer BUZZES He startles BUZZER goes again

GRIFFIN
Shit OK Who is it for Chrissakes

Pissed he whips the front door open

BEATRICE CONRAD(20’s) is standing in the doorway Gorgeous in
a hipster way Big smile

BEATRICE
I’m here for the sale
(she looks down at his)
Uh bad time

Griffin just now remembers that he is NAKED

GRIFFIN
Clothes

Runs back inside Beatrice waits peeks in then steps
inside She looks around with the expert eye of a junk
hunter drooling at Griffin’s stuff Picks up a vase

GRIFFIN
Excuse me Please don’t touch that
What are you doing in my apartment

BEATRICE
You left the door open so

GRIFFIN
So you just came in

BEATRICE

I know Weird right It was kind of
an impulsive move Actually I’m
pretty surprised by it myself

(beat)
I sound like a moron Shouldnt
have done that Let’s start over
Beatrice Nice to meet you

She holds out her hand Griffin reluctantly shakes it and
only now realizes just how beautiful she is They hold the
handshake a beat too long Beatrice gives him the “and your
name is” look

GRIFFIN
Sorry My name’s Griffin And the
yard sale isn’t until tomorrow

BEATRICE
I know I like to get a jump on the
sales You know what they say the
early bird gets the Roseville vase
(Griffin doesn’t get it)
Antique geek humor I work at a
vintage furniture shop

GRIFFIN
You know I’m actually kind of
busy
BEATRICE
(smiling)

Oh are you always naked when
youre busy

GRIFFIN
When I need to think Clothes can
be a distraction Like your
perfume It’s making me nauseous

BEATRICE
I don’t wear perfume

GRIFFIN
Must be on your handbag Probably
vintage right Some old lady’s bag
from the 50’s or something Very
flowery scent with a half life of
100 years give or take

BEATRICE
That’s right Oddly impressive

She puts her bag down by the window Looks at the furniture

BEATRICE
Wow Amazing stuff Are you a
millionaire recluse or closet
Martha Stewart

GRIFFIN
Neither It’s all from my parents’
vacation home in Cape Cod

BEATRICE

(snooty caricature)
Fabulous darling Make me a Bloody
Mary and some cucumber sandwiches

(off his look--)
Sorry my impressions suck I

drunk smurf

They laugh He likes her Again he stares a beat too long
She shifts uncomfortably He snaps out of it

GRIFFIN
So do you see anything you like

BEATRICE
Um yeah Definitely Your parents

GRIFFIN

BEATRICE
Excuse me
GRIFFIN
They’re dead

BEATRICE
Oh I’m sorry

GRIFFIN
Me too

Griffin drifts off for a beat

BEATRICE
Are you okay

GRIFFIN
Yeah I mean it’s just weird
finally getting rid of all of this
stuff Lots of memories

He walks over to a leather chair

GRIFFIN
Said my first word when my dad was
reading to me in this chair
“Pancreas” apparently

BEATRICE
That’s the best first word ever

Griffin smiles NO GIRL ever thought that was cool

GRIFFIN
He was a doctor I used to love
looking at his medical books so
hed read them to me Most kids ask
for Green Eggs and Ham I asked for
Gray’s Anatomy

She raises an eyebrow Smiles He shows her a curio case

GRIFFIN
My mom used to fill this with me
and my sister’s artwork instead of
fancy ceramic crap She loved to
see her society friends wrinkle
their noses at it

BEATRICE
That’s sweet Where does sis live

GRIFFIN
Um she died too

She looks at him Realizes now there was some tragedy

BEATRICE
Sorry Sorry I keep saying sorry

GRIFFIN
It’s okay It’s hard to know what
to say when someone tells you their
whole family was wiped out

He notices she’s a bit choked up and wipes a TEAR off her
cheek She smiles Awkward moment After a beat --

BEATRICE
So why give all this stuff away
then If it has so much meaning

GRIFFIN
I’m going away For awhile

BEATRICE
Cool Where are you going

GRIFFIN
(thinks about it)
Not exactly sure yet You want some
coffee

BEATRICE
Love some

While Griffin makes coffee Beatrice walks around then noses
up to his bedroom door and peaks inside --

On a table next to his bed she sees the strange DEEP SIX
MACHINE from the opening scene --

Suddenly Beatrice’s playful demeanor changes She stands
there stock still turning pale

Griffin comes up behind her closes his bedroom door

GRIFFIN
There’s nothing in there for sale
(sees her face)
Are you all right

BEATRICE
(she’s not all right)
Was that a Kevorkian machine

GRIFFIN
(nervous laugh)
No But now I’m impressed How
would you know what

BEATRICE
I saw that movie about him With Al
Pacino Freaked me out

GRIFFIN
Yeah I love Al Pacino It’s
actually a water purification
prototype I’m kind of an amateur
inventor in my spare time

BEATRICE
(not buying it)
No shit Can I see it

GRIFFIN
Not just yet Trade secrets and
all I could show you but then I’d
have to kill you

He laughs Courtesy laugh from her Another awkward moment
broken by -- The SMOKE ALARM going off in the kitchen

GRIFFIN
Shit Coffee

He runs to the kitchen Comes back with coffee

GRIFFIN
So how much

BEATRICE
How much for what

GRIFFIN
All my dusty old memories

BEATRICE
Oh I’d have to talk to my boss

GRIFFIN
Just tell him to take it and he can
pay me whatever he wants

BEATRICE
You’re kidding right There has to
be 15-20 grand in furniture
alone You need to have a proper
estate sale or

GRIFFIN
I want you to take it Really I’d
feel better if it was you I’m not
worried about the money

Dual emotions for her She’s touched by the sentiment but her
anxiety is back She looks at the door to his room like
she’s about to say something He quickly checks his watch
GRIFFIN

Damn I have to go So sorry Can

you just send a truck over later I

can meet the driver this afternoon
He scribbles down his number Hands it to her

BEATRICE
Are you sure

GRIFFIN
Absolutely

He gently shuffles her out the door while she still holds his
coffee cup He sees the cup and blushes a bit

GRIFFIN
I’m being rude huh

BEATRICE
It’s okay I understand Here

She hands him the coffee mug

GRIFFIN
No Keep it Finish your coffee

She looks at him strangely as they exit the apartment

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

They walk out of the building Neither one of them really
wants to leave or knows what to say He offers his hand

GRIFFIN
Well it was nice to

Out of nowhere she KISSES him on the cheek This catches him
by surprise They look at each other for a beat He smiles

GRIFFIN
Nice to meet you Beatrice

He starts to walk away

BEATRICE
Hey

He turns She wants to say something so bad but can’t

BEATRICE
Um nice to meet you too

He smiles and jogs to the Subway entrance

BEATRICE
(to herself pissed)
Nice to meet you too Really

She watches Griffin disappear down the steps

CUT TO

EXT GRIFFIN’S APARTMENT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A MOVING TRUCK is double parked Griffin watches a couple
guys load in the last of the furniture He hands them a
healthy tip As they drive away his cell phone rings

EXT WILLIAMSBURG BROOKLYN - EVENING

Hipster paradise The MOVING TRUCK pulls up to a VINTAGE
FURNITURE STORE called “PAST TENSE”

INT PAST TENSE - CONTINUOUS

Beatrice is working behind the counter She watches worried
as they unload Griffin’s things Bea’s CO-WORKER walks up --

SABINE (late 20s) Everything about her is JET BLACK-- short
hair clothes boots She has a tattoo of a hand wrapped
around her NECK nails digging into the skin drawing blood

SABINE
Heard you hit the jackpot this
morning on that Craigslist sale
Boss man hasn’t been this happy
since that model got beat up on TV

BEATRICE
Yeah it’s weird though The guy
was really nice but something was
off Felt like he’s out on the
ledge you know

SABINE
Why because he gave you a good
deal

BEATRICE

A good deal Terry wrote him a
check for 750

SABINE
Bullshit Seriously There’s gotta
be 20K in that haul

BEATRICE
Maybe I should go over there Take
the check myself I don’t feel
right about this I think this guy
might be thinking about

SABINE
What Offing himself He probably
needs the money for drugs Was he
all gloom and doom depressed

BEATRICE
No Actually he was pretty amped

SABINE
Gack freak Those dudes would sell
their mother for the next bump

Beatrice shakes her head She isn’t convinced Sabine
switches gears --

SABINE
Hey I have a show at Burial Friday
night You should come for once

Sabine is into Beatrice Her tough facade melts as she tries
to gently persuade Bea to come see her show

BEATRICE
Yeah maybe Sounds cool

Sabine rolls her eyes at this stock answer Bea is still pre-
occupied watching the guys bringing in Griffin’s stuff

SABINE
Holy shit You’re actually into

about

CUT TO

INT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Griffin is sitting with Raymond Raymond’s eyes are closed
Griffin is staring out the window while he talks

GRIFFIN
I met this pretty girl today You
would have liked her Sort of a
nerdy hipster Wearing grandma’s
goodwill sweater but you can tell
she’s you know Hot and all

He looks at Raymond then back at the window

GRIFFIN
Thought you would approve Since
youre always calling me a nancy-
boy and a poofter whatever the

Griffin smiles A nurse walks in

After Griffin leaves we realize that Raymond has died The
nurse gently pulls the sheet over his face

INT PAST TENSE - NIGHT

Beatrice turns out the lights and locks up the shop She
stares at Griffin’s FATHER’S CHAIR for a long beat Sits in
it and thinks Then she grabs her coat and leaves quickly
INT GRIFFIN’S APARTMENTBEDROOM - NIGHT

BACK TO THE SCENE FROM THE BEGINNING--

Griffin is shirtless glistening in sweat He starts getting
wired up Tapes ELECTRODES and METAL DEFIB DISCS to his

chest Everything is connected to his laptop

He rips open a STERILE PACK with a MULTI PORT IV CATHETER
Inserts the needle in his arm and turns on the VIDEO CAMERA

GRIFFIN

(twitchy)

CUT TO

INT SUBWAY - NIGHT

Beatrice is jammed in with other commuters When she reaches
her STOP she shoves her way through in a hurry to get out

BACK TO

GRIFFIN--

Final tube empties He fights it Knocks over the Laptop and
the camera Heart rate monitor FLATLINES

He goes limp on the bed -- DEAD
GRIFFIN’S POV--

Blurry distorted view Griffin is looking at his ceiling The
image blurs darkens then --

BLACK SCREEN ALL SOUND CEASES

NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE POV--

In the blackness the sound of the flatline heart monitor
FADES UP PICTURE FADES IN We are FLOATING on the ceiling
looking down at Griffin

Then a loud BUZZING sound FADES UP Camera starts to move
ERRATICALLY The room turns to a BLUR and we begin MOVING
FORWARD at high speed through a --

TUNNEL--

Images pass by like bullet train landscapes The BUZZING
sound becomes a symphony of VOICES

A pinhole of LIGHT breaks through the darkness in the
distance It gets brighter and brighter until we are in the
middle of a SPHERE OF LIGHT

A beautiful technicolor dream image maps itself to the entire
sphere until we are fully immersed in a 3-DIMENSIONAL MOVING
IMAGE ENVIRONMENT

The images are THE STORY OF GRIFFIN’S LIFE--
We experience his BIRTH See the love from his new parents

Then as he grows older we see rapid FLASHES from his past--
Christmases baseball games birthday parties girlfriends

We see his FAMILY -- His little sister OLIVIA and how he
adores her

Then we see the FIRE -- and the horrific deaths of Olivia and
Griffin’s parents After that Griffin’s life becomes dark
and lonely -- foster homes dead end jobs He immerses
himself in studying NDE and building his DEEP SIX equipment

Then the images SLOW DOWN and we see Griffin’s DEATH as he
flatlines in his apartment Finally the entire image sphere
EVAPORATES and we DISSOLVE TO --

EXT CAPE COD BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON GRIFFIN-- His eyes are closed A small rush of water
splashes into his face and he opens his eyes

PULL BACK TO REVEAL-- He is lying on a BEACH right on the
edge of the water The surf is moving in and out around him
He stands and looks around shielding his eyes from the sun

CUT TO

LADY walks up and opens the door Beatrice follows her in

INT GRIFFIN’S APARTMENTCOMMON HALLWAY - SAME
Beatrice walks up to Griffin’s door and KNOCKS No answer

BEATRICE
(smiling)
Griffin You in there It’s

Still no reply The window to the FIRE ESCAPE is open She
sticks her head out trying to see if the lights are on in
Griffin’s apartment One window is LIT UP

EXT FIRE ESCAPE - CONTINUOUS

Beatrice climbs out and walks carefully along the fire
escape She gets to Griffin’s window and KNOCKS GENTLY

BEATRICE
(to herself)
This is stupid You’re obsessing

Still no reply The sustained TONE of the heart monitor is
droning from inside

BEATRICE
What the hell is that

She peaks into Griffin’s bedroom window through a small
opening in the drapes and freezes momentarily paralyzed by
the horrific image --

THROUGH GRIFFIN’S WINDOW--

Griffin is DEAD on the bed HEART MONITOR is on FLATLINE The
DEEP SIX MACHINE is empty except for the last tube

BEATRICE
Oh my God Help Someone help

She starts KICKING the window until it finally SHATTERS

BACK TO

GRIFFIN’S NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE--

Griffin walks along the empty beach He sees a GIRL playing
in the sand off in the distance As he gets closer he sees
that the girl is OLIVIA his deceased sister She smiles
jumps to her feet and runs to him

OLIVIA
Griffin

She JUMPS into his arms He let’s out years of buried emotion
as he hugs her Crying Laughing Pure joy

OLIVIA
I missed you

He looks at her but he’s crying too hard to get any words
out He kisses her cheek Composes himself

GRIFFIN
I missed you too Liv Mom and dad
Are they here

OLIVIA
Of course silly They’re at the
house

GRIFFIN
Where

She points to a wooden walkway between grass covered dunes
OLIVIA
That way duh We’ve only come here
every summer since forever
He takes her hand but she doesn’t move
OLIVIA
I didn’t think you’d be here yet
Did you come early

He squeezes her hand

GRIFFIN
No I’m right on time

OLIVIA
Yay

As they walk they see Griffin’s old SUMMER HOME His PARENTS
are outside Olivia runs to them Griffin is overwhelmed

He runs to his parents and they embrace His mother kisses
him then looks at him with concern

GRIFFIN’S MOTHER
You shouldn’t be here

GRIFFIN
I can’t believe this is happening
There’s so much I want to tell you
I’m so sorry

All of a sudden he JERKS VIOLENTLY Grabs his chest Drops
to his knees and lets out a LONG HISSING lung full of air

CUT TO

INT GRIFFIN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Beatrice is straddling Griffin giving him CPR

BEATRICE
You CANNOT die Come on

Finally his chest arcs up He takes a huge breath and OPENS
HIS EYES

BEATRICE
Griffin

He starts coughing She slides off him and collapses on the
floor in exhaustion Griffin sits up totally disoriented

GRIFFIN
What happened

BEATRICE
You tried to kill yourself you
coward

GRIFFIN
What No I

She picks up Griffin’s DEEP SIX MACHINE and throws it

GRIFFIN
What are you doing

He jumps out of bed to stop her but his weak legs buckle He
collapses and splits his brow Blood gushes out

GRIFFIN
Ah Jesus

Beatrice’s anger turns to fear when she sees the blood She
pulls him up off the floor back onto the bed

BEATRICE
Don’t move

She runs to the bathroom brings him a towel Props him up on
pillows and jams the towel into his cut He winces in pain
Uncertain what to do Beatrice HUGS him and cries

BEATRICE
How could you

GRIFFIN
I wasn’t trying to kill myself I
mean I was but not permanently

She angrily slides off her leather wristbands and bracelets
Shows him the LONG SCARS on her WRISTS

BEATRICE
Look at this and throw me that line
of bullshit again

GRIFFIN
Oh my God

BEATRICE
You going to be real with me now

GRIFFIN
Yes I’m just not sure how to
explain this

BEATRICE
Try I think I can relate

GRIFFIN
I did this to see my family again
(she looks confused)
Okay when you tried to

BEATRICE
Kill myself You can say it

GRIFFIN
What happened

BEATRICE
I passed out and woke up in the ER

GRIFFIN
Is that all you remember I mean
after you passed out What did you
see

She pauses and tries to hold back tears from coming again

BEATRICE
I saw myself like I was on the
ceiling looking down It was
bizarre

FLASHBACK-- Beatrice’s LIFELESS BODY (late teens) is in a
bathtub full of RED WATER

GRIFFIN
Then what happened

BEATRICE
I was in a tunnel moving fast
Toward a white light It Felt

GRIFFIN
»like you were falling but you
weren’t going down

BEATRICE
(shocked)
Yes

GRIFFIN
And you could hear a million voices
in your head like a buzzing sound

BEATRICE
How did you

He grabs her hands

GRIFFIN
Because I was just there I was in
the Near Death Experience

BEATRICE
Oh my God

GRIFFIN
Didn’t see Him Probably a good
thing I doubt He’d appreciate me
gaming the system

BEATRICE
Did you see your family

He nods tears streaming down his smiling face She puts her
hand on his arm caught up in this moment Then she remembers
why she was pissed off to begin with --

BEATRICE
That’s moving It is But you
seemed to skip past the part where
your death somehow wasn’t going to
be “permanent” It was looking
pretty permanent when I found you

GRIFFIN

At the six minute mark my system
was timed to deliver enough
adrenaline and defib juice to bring
back Seabiscuit Added too much
hypothermic solution when I first
went under and had a seizure

(nods to the broken

laptop)
Lost my parachute so to speak

BEATRICE
So you’re saying If I hadn’t shown
up you really would be

He kisses her unexpectedly then pulls away and grins

GRIFFIN
Dead

He walks over to the fridge Pulls out a BOTTLE OF CRISTAL
GRIFFIN
Celebrate with me
EXT CITY ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Griffin and Beatrice are on a rooftop with a spectacular view
of the CHRYSLER BUILDING He pops the champagne pours it

GRIFFIN
To new beginnings

BEATRICE
New beginnings

They clink glasses He downs his She’s DOESN’T drink hers
Smiles apologetically --

BEATRICE
I’m sorry I don’t really drink

GRIFFIN
Oh Why

This question makes her slightly uncomfortable

BEATRICE
It doesn’t really agree with me

GRIFFIN
Me neither

He throws her glass over his shoulder She laughs They look
out across the city Griffin is lost in thought euphoric
She watches him for a long beat studies his face until --

GRIFFIN
Do you know how long I’ve been
waiting for this moment I have
literally put my life on hold to
find a way to see my family again
I figured my chances of survival
were about 50 at best

BEATRICE
What you did I can’t believe I’m
saying this What you did was
incredibly brave Outrageously
stupid but damn You’re kind of
like an astronaut or something

GRIFFIN
It’s like I pulled back the curtain
and I’ve seen something that
that changes EVERYTHING

BEATRICE
How do you feel

He considers this

GRIFFIN
Fearless Seeing my family that
they’re okay it’s like a weight
has been lifted And just knowing
that there is SOMETHING after we
die is such a relief

He sips champagne and they gaze at the city

BEATRICE
Do you mind if I ask how they died

Griffin looks at her and is silent for a long beat

CUT TO

FLASHBACK-- Griffin is fighting his way down the BURNING
hallway He can hear his sister SCREAMING Right before he
gets to her the ceiling COLLAPSES on him and we CUT TO --

FLOATING POV-- looking down on the smoldering house while
BODIES are being wheeled out on GURNEYS

GRIFFIN (VO)
They died in a house fire We all
did I was dead for forty seven
minutes

Griffin is on the final gurney The EMT’s are trying to
revive him As we float over his body we realize this was the
POV from his actual OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE

GRIFFIN
I became fascinated with the Near
Death Experience

While he looks away she stares at him for a long beat The
attraction between them is palpable When he turns back she
quickly turns away pretending she wasn’t looking

BEATRICE
Do you feel a sense of closure now

GRIFFIN
Closure doesn’t seem like the right
word I mean I feel like I just
opened up something I know now
that my family is still out there
and they’re okay

He starts breaking up Beatrice takes his hand
BEATRICE
I know we just met but do you think

you could do me a favor

GRIFFIN
What’s that

BEATRICE
Please don’t do it again

He looks at the SCARS on her wrist then smiles and casually
holds her hand

GRIFFIN
I’m glad you’re here

BEATRICE
Me too

She blushes slightly at the way Griffin is looking at her
BEATRICE
Youre just lucky I’m a pushy

antique nerd

GRIFFIN
I know Thank you

BEATRICE
In some cultures if you save

someone’s life they are forever in
your debt

GRIFFIN
Forever huh We just met You think
you want me around that long

She looks at him for a long steady moment Then answers him
with a soft kiss

BEATRICE
(smiling)
I don’t know It would be tough but
I think I can handle it

She smiles and looks out over the city Griffin never takes
his eyes off of her After a beat --

GRIFFIN
To life after death

She smiles tears well up

BEATRICE
To life after death

He pulls her into him and they kiss passionately

EXT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Beatrice and Sabine have coffee Sabine is chain smoking

SABINE
So did you sleep with him

BEATRICE
After everything I’ve told you
that’s all you have to say

SABINE
Just watching your back sister
You’re in recovery Sex with
strangers is ill-advised even
under extreme circumstances

BEATRICE
He’s not a stranger More like a
sexy genius

She desperately wants Sabine to be “one of the girls” right
now but Sabine won’t play along

BEATRICE
I mean I brought him back to life
And then we talked until the sun
came up Honestly I think it was
the most intimate night of my life
That has to be good right

Sabine grimaces and blows out a lung full of smoke

SABINE
When you asked me to sponsor you I
told you my deal I don’t have a
sugarcoat setting I tell it like
it is And this isn’t the time for
you to be jumping into anything
serious with anyone Especially not
some whack job

BEATRICE
He’s not a

SABINE
Did he or did he not off himself
just to see if he could have a
little chat with his dead family

Bea looks away Sabine has a point

SABINE
I’m looking out for you girl
That’s my job You know this

BEATRICE
I havent felt this way in a long
time Maybe ever And he’s a good
person I know it I don’t care if
the timing isn’t right

(MORE )

BEATRICE (CONTD)
(sarcastic smile)
Life’s too short

Sabine takes her last sip of coffee goes in for the kill --

SABINE
You tell him you’re a recovering
junkie yet

Stake in the heart Bea starts welling up Looks away

SABINE
That’s what I thought Tell him He
sticks around after that I’1l bake
him some cookies and we can be
BFF’s

She gets up puts on her coat Drops a flyer on the table

SABINE
I go on at 11 if you give a shit

Bea sits in silence as Sabine walks away

INT MORGUE - DAY
Sal and Griffin are drinking scotch in the exam room

SAL
You are one crazy son of a bitch
And of course you gotta kill
yourself to meet a girl

GRIFFIN
(smiling)
Can’t wait for our kids to ask
about our first date

Griffin starts thinking about Bea drifts off

SAL
Wow Hook line and sinker huh

GRIFFIN
Honestly man I’ve never believed
in fate Until now

SAL
You must have friends in high
places
GRIFFIN
All I know is I’ve never felt this
way about anyone before Like it
could be permanent

SAL
That mean you’re done playing
chicken with the Grim Reaper

GRIFFIN
Probably But I got to do something
with my data I just confirmed my
theory about Omega waves This is
huge man Game changing

Griffin pulls the sheet off a corpse Young woman

GRIFFIN
Conventional science treats the
brain like it’s a car battery As
soon as it can’t power the vehicle
we consider it “dead” but there’s
still electricity Not much but
it’s there Omega brainwaves can
cycle for days postmortem I’m
thinking the Omega is the near
death experience

Griffin has an idea

GRIFFIN
Maybe it’s even part of your soul

Griffin gets up and heads for the door

SAL
Where you going

GRIFFIN
Be right back

INT MORGUE - LATER

There is now an ELECTRODE NET on the dead woman’s head
connected to an EEG-- the screen is showing a FLATLINE
Griffin has the back panel open exposing the CIRCUITRY

GRIFFIN
These things are blunt instruments
They’re only calibrated to register
life sustaining brain waves But if
you just

He’s clipping and twisting wires

GRIFFIN
-hot wire it a little Expand
it’s range just enough

He looks at the EEG SCREEN-- The flatline now has a very
slight ARC cycling across the screen Griffin taps it

GRIFFIN
Hello
(looks at the TOE TAG)
Mrs Walker

Griffin prints the EEG and the very subtle waves are there
It’s unmistakable

Sal’s mind just got blown --

SAL
And I thought my job was creepy
before

Griffin studies the Omega waves

GRIFFIN
They’re so odd looking though I
mean check this out

Griffin puts the electrodes on his own head and takes a
reading Pulls the paper full of brainwave scribbles

GRIFFIN
See how normal brainwaves are
shaped They’re sharper and they
spike But the Omegas are smooth
and perfectly consistent Reminds
me of FM and AM radio waves FM
waves are a bunch of small choppy
lines AM are like smooth rolling
hills like one edge of infinity

He draws a second wave intersecting the first making a
perfectly repeating INFINITY SYMBOL across the page

Her smile

GRIFFIN
Compliments to the chef

BEATRICE
Thanks

GRIFFIN

I was joking Is this from that
bodega down the street

BEATRICE
Not everyone lives out of a take
out box I actually made this with
my own hands Crazy right

GRIFFIN
Wow It’s really good

BEATRICE
Damn right You should try playing
with something other than a
soldering iron once in awhile

GRIFFIN
Let’s not get carried away Thank
you for this I can taste the love

BEATRICE
Bea’s Pizza “You can taste the
love” Not bad

GRIFFIN
I’m not a complete nerd

BEATRICE
No More like a mad scientist

GRIFFIN
And youre a renaissance girl with
a dark past

fades a bit

GRIFFIN
Sorry Shouldn’t joke about that

BEATRICE
It’s okay My past is what it is I
just wish I could forget it

GRIFFIN
I know Me too What sucks is you
never know when you’re going to get
blind-sided by it you know

BEATRICE
One minute you’re on top of the
world the next it’s on top of you

GRIFFIN
I’m just glad it didn’t crush you

She gives him a long intimate look

GRIFFIN
What

BEATRICE
Thank you for not asking the
question I know you want to ask

GRIFFIN
I didn’t ask because it wouldn’t
change anything between us

BEATRICE
Sure about that You don’t even
know the answer

GRIFFIN
I think I do

BEATRICE
Okay you tell me why such a nice
girl would try to do such ugly
things to herself

GRIFFIN
The scars on your wrists aren’t the
only ones I saw

She is gut punched but also amazed

BEATRICE
You ARE perceptive

GRIFFIN
And you aren’t the only one trying
to kill the pain I know what it’s
like to want to just check out

She kisses him

BEATRICE
But you planned to come back I
didn’t That’s what bothers me the
most you know Not my horrible
family life or even the drugs
(MORE )

BEATRICE (CONTD)
Those were things that I couldn’t
control The decision to die That
I could control And I made an
awful awful choice

She fights the tears He squeezes her hand
GRIFFIN
Yeah but the choice you made the
other night blows all of that away

He kisses her

BEATRICE
I chose you

They start passionately kissing Stumble towards the --

Things start to move quickly but then out of nowhere --
BEATRICE STOPS

GRIFFIN
What’s the matter

BEATRICE
Nothing I um

GRIFFIN
Hey if you don’t want to do this
yet that’s okay

BEATRICE
Wait here

She walks into her bedroom and shuts the door After a beat
she comes back out

BEATRICE
Shut your eyes

GRIFFIN
What

BEATRICE
Just shut them

He does and she leads him into the

BEDROOM-—-

GRIFFIN
I don’t care if your room is a
mess

BEATRICE
Okay open

He opens his eyes
HIS FATHER’S CHAIR IS SITTING IN HER ROOM WITH A BOW ON IT
Griffin is stunned He looks at her his eyes welling

GRIFFIN
You my dad’s chair

BEATRICE
It was such a big part of your
past I want it to be a part of our
future Sorry that’s kind of
corny

He kisses her deeply and within minutes they are in bed
making love It’s physical and passionate and both of them
are completely taken in by the moment

GRIFFIN
Please tell me you’re in the tub
Im feeling pretty dirty

He walks up to the bathroom door gently knocks

GRIFFIN
Can I come in

He tentatively pushes the door open and his smile turns
immediately to fear and panic

GRIFFIN
No Beatrice

ON TUB--

Beatrice is in the tub naked The water is red from her
blood Her skin is more pale than the porcelain Her face
eyes open is eerily peaceful almost smiling

Griffin pulls her out of the water and checks her pulse

INT BEATRICE’S APARTMENTLIVING ROOM - LATER

PATROL OFFICERS tape off the entry A crime scene TECH is
standing in the doorway of the BATHROOM photographing the
scene A MEDICAL EXAMINER is examining the body

Griffin sits in stunned silence on the couch Total wreck He
watches blankly as a TECH carries some EVIDENCE BAGS past him
toward the --

FRONT DOOR--

DETECTIVE MICHAEL CHARON walks in He’s wiry with a
quiet intensity And the kind of respect he’s given says this
guy is known for something major But we’ll never know what

Charon stops the tech and takes a quick look at the evidence
bags No reaction Tech continues out

Charon’s partner DETECTIVE GIBBS steps in African
American Built like a brick shit-house Wears a tight suit
in case there’s any doubt Nobody fucks with Gibbs

Charon nods to the couch

CHARON
He the one that found her

GIBBS
Yep The boyfriend Usual drill
Refuses to accept the obvious

They walk over to Griffin He stands up

GRIFFIN
You’re detectives right Does that
mean this is a probable homicide
Cause there’s no way she killed
herself I was just with her last
night

CHARON
Take it easy What’s your name

GRIFFIN
Griffin Black sir

CHARON
Okay Griffin Here’s how this
works Your only job right now is
to go down to the station and give
a statement okay This needs to
happen right away

GRIFFIN
Can’t I just give you my

Gibbs calmly holds up his hand Griffin stops talking

CHARON
My job is to look at what we have
here I’ve already spoken to the
Medical Examiner and it appears to
be suicide Cut and dry

(MORE)

CHARON (CONTD)
(Griffin starts to
interrupt)
But All sudden deaths are treated
as suspicious until cleared so no
assumptions are being made

GRIFFIN
I hope not Because she would never
do this No way

Gibbs hands Charon his NOTE PAD Charon reads the notes

CHARON
She’s had a previous suicide
attempt

GIBBS

And she’s a former addict

GRIFFIN
It was a couple years ago But
she’s not the same person

GIBBS
Statistically speaking this is not
uncommon given the history

GRIFFIN
She didn’t do this

CHARON
Listen it’s a hard truth to
accept But right now there is not
a shred of evidence to suggest this
is anything other than a suicide

GRIFFIN
(breaking up)

She didn’t leave a note People
leave a note They don’t just
(looks toward the door)

She didn’t

CHARON
I’m sorry kid I am I just need
to get your statement and you can
go home

Griffin looks back at the bathroom as Gibbs leads him away

His printer spits out a page He puts it down in front of
Griffin Hands him a pen He signs Looks up pissed --

GRIFFIN
If you guys are just going to
rubber stamp this a suicide then
why does it take a week to clear
Gibbs gives him a hard look then eases off --

GIBBS
Gotta do an autopsy

This gets Griffin’s attention He’s thinking about something
Has that look when his brain is on overdrive

Yo man You okay

Griffin still deep in thought stands and walks away

Thank you

Oh man
(gently nudges Griffin)
Hey buddy

(Griffin wakes up)
I got your message I don’t know
what to say man How you doing

GRIFFIN
Is she here

Sal looks extremely uncomfortable

SAL
I don’t know yet Come on I’1l
make some coffee

MORGUE--

They walk in Sal grabs a CLIPBOARD reads it looks at
Griffin Griffin immediately turns to the MORGUE DRAWERS

GRIFFIN
Which one is it

Sal quickly walks over gets between Griffin and the drawers

SAL
Buddy I feel for you I really do
But there is NO WAY I am letting
you anywhere near that body This
is still technically an open
investigation until the autopsy
clears it as suicide

GRIFFIN
I need to see her Sal

SAL
That’s what funerals are for
brother Now get in my office

SAL’S OFFICE--
They sit and Sal pours them some coffee

GRIFFIN
She’s still in there you know

SAL
Maybe so But there is some shit
you do not come back from And
Beatrice is not coming back okay

GRIFFIN
I don’t think she’s coming back
I think she hasn’t left yet
(MORE)

GRIFFIN (CONTD)
(Sal gives him a look)
I already proved to you that Omegas
are still firing That’s
electricity a data signal

SAL
So what It’s HER brain You can’t
see what she’s seeing

GRIFFIN
It’s theoretically possible Our
brains would just have to be on the
exact same wavelength
(thinking - to himself)
Which means I’d have to be dead
too So no problem there

SAL
No problem there You’re seriously
losing it man

GRIFFIN
I just need to create some kind of
switching device -- like a router

that syncs us once I hit flatline

SAL
Did I mention I’m not letting you
anywhere near the body

Griffin snaps back to reality

GRIFFIN
The cops don’t give a shit about
her They’re going to rule it a
suicide And I won’t harm the body

SAL
I have mouths to feed Griff I
cannot lose this job And you just
might lose your life So forget it

Griffin looks defeated

GRIFFIN
When’s the autopsy

SAL
Things are a little backed up

Sal turns to look at the clipboard again Griffin snags his
KEY CARD while he’s turned away

SAL
At least 48 hours which puts us
into Sunday Looks like first thing
Monday morning
(turns back)
Why

GRIFFIN
(lying)
I want to make the funeral
arrangements She doesn’t have
anyone else

SAL
Now you’re talking like a real
person I’ll help any way I can

Griffin tears up tries to shake an image from his head

GRIFFIN
Every time I close my eyes I see
her Sal She was the one

Sal opens a drawer pulls out a bottle of Scotch and pours
some in both of their coffee cups

SAL
Try and relax There’s no easy way
through this You know that better
than anyone

GRIFFIN

I just If I could just see her
Talk to her one more time I guess
what I really want is to say
goodbye

(takes a drink)
But that’s what funerals are for
right Sal

(puts the glass down)
Thanks for the drink

SAL
No problem kid

Griffin leaves It’s painful for Sal to see him like this
MORGUE--
As Griffin walks out Sal comes out of his office

SAL
Hey Griff Come here for a minute

Griffin turns Sal grabs EXAM GLOVES and a SURGICAL GOWN

SAL
Put these on

GRIFFIN
What are we doing

SAL
You wanted to say goodbye right
(Griffin nods)
Let’s do this before my better
judgement takes over

They suit up and walk to the BODY DRAWERS Sal unlocks one of
the drawers slides it out Black body bag Griffin tenses

SAL
You sure you can handle this

GRIFFIN
Yeah I’m sure

Sal unzips the body bag and slowly reveals Beatrice’s FACE
Her eyes are closed and her skin is ghostly pale Seeing her
lifeless nearly frozen corpse takes Griffin’s breath away

SAL
This is a bad idea

GRIFFIN
No No I need this
(stares at her)
Can I be alone with her

SAL
Five minutes DO NOT touch her
even with the gloves Understood

Griffin nods Sal pats him on the back and walks away

Griffin stares at Bea for a long time and his face changes
from crippling grief to RESOLVE

GRIFFIN
I know you didn’t do this And I’m
going to prove it
(touches her hand)
But I need you to wait for me

He takes a small AEROSOL CAN out of his pocket sprays it
into the LOCK of the body drawer and waits watching for Sal

RED FOAM bubbles out of the lock and HARDENS After a beat he
carefully pulls out a perfect KEY FORM from the lock Quickly
pockets it Sal walks back

GRIFFIN
Thank you This really helped

SAL
No problem brother

Sal carefully closes the zipper on the body bag and slides
Beatrice back into the drawer

The JANITOR CARL (50s) is buffing the floor down the hall
Griffin starts to turn around but the guy sees him and waves

CARL
Griff You on graveyard man

Griffin looks down at the gurney Some WIRES are falling out
from under the sheet Carl’s interest is a bit too peaked

GRIFFIN
Hey Carl No just doing Sal a
favor He’s slammed

Homeless intake

Carl’s morbid curiosity kicks in He reaches for the sheet

Oh Better not Wife thinks I smell
bad enough as it is

They have a laugh

the county morgue in Manhattan I
have created a technology that if
successful will allow me to
contact and communicate with the
dead In this case Beatrice

(beat - gathers himself)
She died twenty-two hours ago

He PANS the camera to show BEATRICE on the GURNEY After a
beat he pans over to an odd looking HOMEMADE DEVICE about the
size of a CAR BATTERY LCD monitors have been hard wired to
the guts and fastened to the base unit with zip ties

GRIFFIN (0S)

I’ve taken hardware from a stock
Electroencephalogram and integrated
it with a double stage amplifier
I’m calling it BASIL --
Brainwave Amplifier and SIgnal
Locator

(he looks at Bea touches

her hair)
I know you’re still in there and
I’m going to find you

He picks up one of two EEG RECORDING NETS a helmet-shaped
web of electrodes attached to the unit by a braided cable

GRIFFIN
My theory is based on my discovery
of deep-brain electrical activity
that continues for several days
postmortem It will be phasing in
the rare Omega frequency

Looks at Beatrice for a long beat

GRIFFIN

Once BASIL identifies the signal
it will be synchronized with a
secondary signal -- a sort of
passenger signal Mine

(looks into the camera)
Put simply I am going to attempt
to joyride on someone else’s death
experience

Griffin gently puts the ELECTRODE NET on Bea’s head and we
CUT OUT of the CAMCORDER POV --

He puts on the other electrode net Takes his shirt off and
tapes various wires to his chest

He inserts the multi-port IV coming from the DEEP SIX MACHINE
in his arm Starts typing

TWO EEG SIGNALS appear Griffin’s brainwaves are strong and
active Bea’s are flatlined except for a line labelled OMEGA--
It has a small but very distinct PATTERN repeating

Opens a new window -- “REVIVE TIMER” Keys in “6 MINUTES”
Lays down on the table Takes a deep breath

progress bar Then-- “SYNCHRONIZATION COMPLETE” and their
individual signals becoming ONE DATA STREAM

SOUND CEASES

GRIFFIN’S DEEP SIX--

We are FLOATING on the ceiling looking down at Griffin and
Beatrice

The room dims We see SMALL DARK FIGURES in silhouette
surrounding the periphery They are swaying in an odd rhythm
just at the edge of the light They look like CHILDREN

We hear their VOICES but can’t hear what they are saying
Their voices are child-like and SOOTHING --

“Come with us” “Don’t be afraid” Then we hear --
BEATRICE
(faint distant)
Griffin Griffin

The figures move and we move with them their small hands and
voices beckoning We move further into DARKNESS

Strange lights flash sporadically temporarily illuminating
the LANDSCAPE which appears to be a CITY with no lights

Dark pools of water are everywhere We see FLASHES of PEOPLE
in the street It looks like skid row with gaunt hollow
eyed JUNKIES and VAGRANTS twitching with psychosis

The child-like figures keep beckoning and reassuring --

“Come with us” “Don’t be afraid”

We slow down reluctant and they slow down surrounding us
again - beckoning - this time more INSISTENT

They move and we follow but we ARE AFRAID The junkies and
vagrants are now ROTTING CORPSES teeming with maggots

We slow down but the dark figures come closer Their
demeanor becomes AGGRESSIVE

“Don’t stop” “You’ll die here” “You need us”

Then the light flashes reveal their FACES They are small
like children but have empty eye sockets and sinister GRINS

They come after us Grabbing and scratching We hear distant
SCREAMS Our screams We can’t get away More are coming

Then we hear Beatrice’s voice

BEATRICE
Griffin

We blast through the attackers and move quickly through the
darkness leaving our attackers behind We see --

BEATRICE at the end of the street

She is looking for us can’t find us She disappears down a
street searching

We run after her Round the corner and see her APARTMENT
BUILDING The light in her apartment is the only light we
see We sprint into the building

INT BEATRICE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

incredibly ACUTE Every sound is an EXPLOSION Every flash of

the flash of a nuclear bomb blinding and dizzying

ON GRIFFIN-- seeing Bea face to face for the first time
since she died He can barely speak Finally --

GRIFFIN
Bea

She doesn’t react He steps toward her reaches for her and
then he is hit by another FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT

His eyes adjust and he watches Bea walk into the bathroom He
follows her in

BATHROOM-—

GRIFFIN
Beatrice

No response She starts a bath The water sounds like a huge
wave crashing He finally understands --

GRIFFIN
It’s a memory

Realizes that he is watching the FINAL MOMENTS OF HER LIFE

She lights candles This simple action is now LOUD and
MESMERIZING -- a crackling inferno Then we hear --

THE SOFT KNOCK ON THE DOOR

BEATRICE
Hopefully somebody called in
sick

She checks herself in the MIRROR but now the IMAGE GLITCHES
switching from her face to GRIFFIN’S and back again She
smiles walks out We follow her and notice a --

DARK FIGURE

A woman maybe standing in the shadows of the bedroom
watching Waiting Griffin walks toward the bedroom curious
but stops when Bea gets to the --

FRONT DOOR--

She doesn’t check the peephole Thinks it’s Griffin

BEATRICE
Forget something big boy

She UNLOCKS the door and everything SLOWS DOWN She turns the
knob The door cracks open and we’re in SUPER SLOW-MOTION --

We see a strange MAN Eyes filled with RAGE And we --
SPEEDRAMP TO FULL SPEED--

HE RUSHES into the apartment Bea STUMBLES BACKWARD onto a
chair She is TERRIFIED

This is TRAVIS DARROW SHAVED HEAD sharp beard and NECK
TATS Gaunt but muscular and powerful His hands are covered
with JAILHOUSE INK He just stands there smiling at her

TRAVIS
Did you miss me BB

BEATRICE
Travis What are you

He gets right into her face and we SEE HIM FROM HER POV
TRAVIS
(mocking)
Travis I’m so happy to see you I
missed you SO MUCH
SMASH CUT TO

KITCHEN--
FAST CUT MONTAGE
LIGHTER - SPOON - POWDER TURNS TO LIQUID - SYRINGE

SMASH CUT TO

BEA’S FACE--

She is staring at the SYRINGE between Travis’ gray TEETH He
sits next to her and ties the surgical tubing around her arm

She is shaking with fear paralyzed

GRIFFIN
RUN RUN

But his voice is distant and trails off to nothing

Travis puts the SYRINGE in Bea’s hand closes her fingers
around it holds his hand over hers The tattoo on the back
of his hand is some kind of DEMON that moves on his hand

TRAVIS
I love you Travis I can never love
anyone else but you Without you I
would die

He starts KISSING her hard almost violently Helps her move
the needle to her arm while he sticks his tongue down her
throat Starts to unbutton her blouse as he presses the
needle against her skin

When she hesitates he slides his hand down her cheek in a
caress and then circles her throat with it He doesn’t choke
her but his hand on her windpipe is message enough

ON BEA-- Her eyes well up All hope is gone and --

SHE DEPRESSES THE PLUNGER ON THE SYRINGE

GRIFFIN
NO

BEA CLOSES HER EYES as the heroin hits her blood SLOWS
EVERYTHING DOWN The whole world feels like it is UNDERWATER
and then BLACKNESS
DISSOLVE TO
BATHROOM--—
Bea is sitting on the floor her back against the tub She is
in a drug induced daze her eyes fluttering Travis wakes her
up by splashing water on her face
TRAVIS
I’m going to enjoy killing your new

boyfriend Maybe you can watch

He moves her mouth and speaks for her

TRAVIS
Yes Please My Love

He laughs at this and lights a cigarette She closes her eyes
and the memory becomes increasingly FRAGMENTED and GLITCHY

UNKNOWN VOICE (0S)
GRIFFIN

A MAN’S VOICE distant but audible When he calls Griffin’s
name we are briefly RIPPED from the scene in Bea’s apartment
and into a --

SPHERE OF BLINDING LIGHT-- More VOICES are screaming

UNKNOWN VOICES (0S)
GRIFFIN COME ON BREATH

IN RAPID FIRE CUTS--

We are IN AND OUT of Beatrice’s bathroom We see BITS AND
PIECES of her with Travis Despite her half conscious
condition he is holding her up against the wall kissing and
groping her She tries to fight him but is powerless

On our FINAL CUT BACK to her from the BLINDING LIGHT we see
her laying DEAD in the tub the water filled with her BLOOD

Time has passed Travis is GONE and the CANDLES HAVE BURNED
DOWN TO POOLS OF WAX Then from behind --

BEATRICE (0S)
Griffin

ON GRIFFIN-- He turns around and Bea is standing there She
looks confused scared

BEATRICE
Thank god I found you I was lost
I’ve been looking

They embrace She closes her eyes as she hugs him Griffins
emotions come pouring out --

GRIFFIN
I love you

BEATRICE
I love you too
What’s wrong

Then she sees HERSELF behind him in the tub The image takes
her breath away

BEATRICE
Oh my god Griffin What’s
happening

GRIFFIN
Bea you

He realizes she has no idea where she is or what’s going on
He turns her away from the image

GRIFFIN
Look at me What’s the last thing
you remember

She thinks Shakes her head trying to remember Then --

SAL (0S)
GRIFFIN

Rapid FLASHES of THE MORGUE intercut with BEATRICE like a
strobe light

Sal’s VOICE and the VOICES OF OTHERS can be heard shouting
Then the strobing STOPS and we are seeing --

GRIFFIN’S POV-- Back in the MORGUE Sal and several EMTs
hover over him

SAL
Griff Stay with me

BLACKNESS AGAIN
Then Griffin is back with Beatrice She knows now --
BEATRICE
(breathless panic)

Oh my God Oh my God

He tries to touch her but the entire scene is MOVING AWAY
RAPIDLY

BEATRICE

He reaches for her but she’s too far away now

GRIFFIN (0S)
Beatrice Beatrice

She reaches for him but the BLINDING LIGHT ENGULFS US

CUT TO

INT MORGUE - CONTINUOUS
Sal and the EMT’s stand over Griffin They’ve given up

SAL
You idiot

He grabs an EPI syringe and injects Griffin Throws the empty
on the floor with the others The EMT touches his shoulder

EMT
He’s gone Better call the cops

Sal nods tries wiping away the tears that keep coming
OVERHEAD SHOT--

Sal stands in shock between their bodies Beatrice lying in
her half open drawer is still connected by wires and
electrodes to Griffin dead on the gurney

DISSOLVE TO

INT MORGUE - LATER

Griffin is now lying in an open BODY BAG on the gurney An
ASSISTANT is filling out a TOE TAG while Detective Gibbs
pokes around Griffin’s gear amazed

GIBBS
I’ve seen some crazy shit but this
here is next level

The assistant nods zips the bag shut Behind him we can see
Charon interviewing Sal in the office

SAL’S OFFICE--
Sal is behind his desk looks like shit warmed over

CHARON
You say you knew him pretty well
yet you have no idea whatsoever
what he was up to Or that this was
his girlfriend

SAL
(lying)
No Like I said this is how I
found him That’s all I know
Youre the detective you tell me
what this is all about
Charon looks out at the crime scene for a beat then --

CHARON
Okay Way I see it Romeo over
there finally came to terms with
the fact that Juliet swallowed the
hemlock of her own accord Then
decides he wants to check out
too Only Romeo happens to be a
twisted geek genius so his version
of dying with his lover is let’s
just say elaborate

Gibbs walks in points out to the BODY DRAWERS

GIBBS
He had a key to that drawer Doc
Any idea where he got it

SAL
How would I know He had access so
anything is possible
(getting pissed)
He didn’t get it from me if that’s
what your asking And even implying
as much could cost me my job

CHARON
Your job is the least of your
concerns right now You better hope
he didn’t murder that girl first
then come to play out the rest of
his twisted jerk-off scenario
here on your watch

GIBBS
Kind of hard to believe he could
just get all that shit in here
unnoticed

SAL
Yeah well he did And I don’t set
the security protocols at this

CHARON

Relax Right now the only crime is
BandE and desecration And the perp’s
dead so As long as the autopsy
confirms the girl committed suicide
it’s clean Bizarre as all hell
but clean In the mean time his
stuff

(points to Griffin’s gear)

RE)

CHARON (CONTD)
does not leave this ice box or
my problem becomes your problem We
clear

SAL
Crystal

Charon and Gibbs leave

INT MORGUE - CONTINUOUS

Sal walks out of his office starts loading Griffins
EQUIPMENT in an empty STORAGE LOCKER locks it and sits
down exhausted After a quiet beat

BEHIND SAL--

A FINGER pokes through the top of the BODY BAG zipper and
slowly PULLS THE ZIPPER DOWN Sal hears the sound of the
zipper opening and looks up slowly turns around

GRIFFIN SITS UP

Sal JUMPS out of his chair cracks his head on a cabinet and
crashes down on a metal tray Tools go flying Sal smacks

down on the linoleum out cold

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN TO--

Sal’s POV Griffin is sitting over him slaps him lightly
pours some water on him

ON SAL-- Coming to Groggy

SAL
Am I dead
GRIFFIN
No
SAL

What about you

GRIFFIN
Not anymore

Sal sits up disoriented Griffin helps him into the chair
which is when they both realize Griffin is still NAKED with a
TAG on his toe Sal points to Griffin’s clothes sealed in
oversized ZIPLOCK BAGS

GRIFFIN
Oh Right

Griffin gets dressed Sal punches his arm

GRIFFIN
Ow Shit

SAL
Just making sure you’re real I
don’t get it man We tried
everything I hit you with enough
adrenaline to start a Mac truck

Griffin starts getting dressed Thinks about it --

GRIFFIN
Delayed response Epi trapped in my
fatty tissues leaked out when my
cells started breaking down

SAL
(considers this)
That wouldve taken a lot longer
than six minutes buddy You’re
brain should be oatmeal

GRIFFIN
That’s just the safe average There
are cases where people have come
back hours after death was called
Some sort of genetic predisposition
for survival is my theory Rare
but it happens

SAL
Well SOMETHING happened anyway You
remember anything

GRIFFIN
EVERYTHING She was murdered

SAL
Wait what

GRIFFIN
(excited)
I made contact

SAL
Or you experienced a hypoxic
event and were dreaming about the
woman you love

GRIFFIN
When you perform the autopsy
youll find heroin on the tox
screen He dosed her Then killed
her when she couldn’t defend
herself Slit wrists are just good
theater Cops see those and stop
looking

Griffin holds his head in his hands miserable with grief

SAL
But the report said she was a
former addict How is the heroin
going to

GRIFFIN
(can barely say it)
Test for DNA He also

Cant finish Sal pats him on the back

GRIFFIN
Just keep her brain intact as long
as you can Promise me

SAL
I promise she won’t get bumped up
but the autopsy is set for Monday
9am Nothing I can do about that

Griffin nods turns to leave

SAL
Where are you going You need to
get checked out

GRIFFIN
No I need to find Beatrice’s
killer and make sure he pays for
what he did

SAL
You need to tell the cops If
you’re right I’1ll find the
evidence Let them do their job

GRIFFIN
There’s no time An investigation
will take weeks She’s gone forever
in two days
(looks at her drawer)
I need to see her again

He walks to the door stops --

GRIFFIN
I’m sorry I dragged you into this
I wouldn’t have done what I did if
I wasn’t sure

SAL
Yeah Okay Just don’t get yourself
killed Again

He drinks some water

GRIFFIN
I mean I know the difference

And then there’s this

A spiderweb of BLUE VEINS snakes across his chest

SAL
Dios mio You look like a corpse

GRIFFIN
Feel my skin

Sal touches it

SAL
It’s cold as ice

GRIFFIN
Might be a side effect of the

evidence-- Griffin’s equipment notebooks diagrams of his
deep six machine etc

Charon sees the photo of Griffin’s FAMILY on the night stand
Opens some drawers Throws his clothes out of the closet

Finds a MILITARY FOOTLOCKER Picks the lock Opens it
Griffin’s JOURNALS are stacked neatly inside

Gibbs walks over

GIBBS
Just got a call from patrol at
Darrow’s apartment He’s dead GSW
to the head

CHARON
So Black must have gotten to him
Simple revenge if he thought Darrow
killed the girl

(thinks for a beat)

Doesn’t explain the morgue though
Or Black’s resurrection Where are
we with Sal Garcia

GIBBS
Wife said he was at a sports bar
Sent a car He’s in the wind

CHARON
He’s in this with Black Whatever
this is

GIBBS

Let’s just get’em and we’ll sort it
out under the hot lights

(beat - frustrated)
Can we just talk about the elephant
for a second I mean Black was
dead As a doornail We saw it with
our own eyes You can’t fake that
shit Then he shows up How

CHARON
I don’t know Something we’re not
seeing

(MORE)

CHARON (CONTD)
(holds up the Journals)
Maybe these’1l shed some light

INT BMW - LATER

Griffin and Sal are sitting in the PARKING GARAGE Sal looks
like he’s going to throw up Griffin looks half dead

SAL
We should turn ourselves in

GRIFFIN
We will After I find her killer
She’s gone in one day Sal One
more day That’s all I ask

SAL
No Absolutely not This is your
obsession Not mine This ends now

GRIFFIN
Then we go to jail Both of us The
cops will pin Travis on me for
sure Maybe even Bea And you’re in
it almost as deep I have to catch
her killer That is the only sure
way out of this Am I right

Sal’s eyes dart around as he runs through the options Then
he starts POUNDING the steering wheel in a mini-rage Barking
out OBSCENITIES in Spanish-- “Puta” this and “Chinga” that
Finally stops Breaths Calms down a little

GRIFFIN
Ill take that as a yes

While Griffin thinks Sal broods Then his PHONE RINGS

GRIFFIN
Do not answer that

Sal lets it go to voicemail Then checks it on speaker --

SAL’S WIFE (VOICEMAIL)
(crying)
Salvador You need to come home
right now The police are here
Please come home

Sal hangs up looks at Griffin The rage is back
SAL
Tell me you have a plan

GRIFFIN
I do Hear me out Travis is
murdered an hour after fifty people
witnessed me almost kill him
Hardly a coincidence I’m being set
up But why Who would do that

Sal considers this

SAL
Someone who wants you to stop what
your doing Someone that thinks
you’re a threat

GRIFFIN

Exactly Beatrice’s killer They
convince the cops it’s suicide but
not me I start pulling at that
thread so I need to be dealt with
Whoever killed Bea killed Travis

(gives him a look)
And Sal only one person knows for
sure who killed Travis and
that’s Travis

At first Sal isn’t sure what Griffin means then --

SAL
No way ENOUGH with the Dr
Frankenstein shit First off I
can’t get to Travis’ body Second
that cracker was shot in the head

GRIFFIN
It was small caliber and there was
no exit wound Good chance his
brain it’s still viable Only one
way to find out

SAL
Back to the first point I can’t
get to the body

Griffin starts the car and backs out

GRIFFIN
I think I can

Takes out a new pre-paid CELL Opens the package dials

EXT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - LATER

Charon walks toward the entrance past a couple unmarked
CROWN VICS double parked Shakes his head pissed Gibbs is
out front waiting for him

CHARON
DEA Have they taken the body yet

GIBBS
Not yet But they’re about to It
checks out too Darrow is
definitely theirs They sprung him
early to snitch some big case

CHARON
So he’s their snitch Big deal

a center piece in a double murder
investigation We need that body

INT MORGUE - CONTINUOUS

AGENTS wearing DEA jackets watch while an attendant preps
Travis’ corpse Charon and Gibbs walk in Charon addresses
AGENT PHILLIPS (40s)

CHARON

You Phillips

(Phillips nods)
So your boys let loose a violent
offender in my town without
informing me and inside of a week
he ends up the victim of one
homicide and a suspect in another
A heads up would have been nice
agent

AGENT PHILLIPS
Sorry detective but my hands were
tied until he bought it last night
Travis Darrow is no ordinary CI --
He happens to be a cog in a very
important wheel Afraid the body
has to come with us

Charon thinks for a beat then --

CHARON
Alright Then I’m going to
accompany the body to DC -- I’m

not waiting three weeks for the
autopsy results to be released

They stare at each other for a long beat Phillips gives in

AGENT PHILLIPS
Suit yourself We’re on the 345
American out of Laguardia

They follow the agents wheeling the body out
HALLWAY -—

CARL the janitor is waiting patiently with his mop and
bucket The morgue doors open and the agents and detectives
wheel the body onto the elevator An agent nods to Carl --

AGENT
Thanks It’s all yours

MORGUE--

Carl walks in looks around Empty He grabs the AUTOPSY
MICROPHONE hanging down from the ceiling

ON MIC-- The small red recording light is ON
Carl switches it off and walks into --

He sits down and hits REWIND on the DIGITAL RECORDING DECK
Waits a beat Presses play We hear the last part of Charon
and Phillip’s conversation with the flight times

Okay Thanks Carl
(hangs up)
Shit DEA just confiscated Travis’
body They’re flying it to DC

SAL
Well that’s that I guess

Griffin thinks for a long beat Looks at Sal eyes wide --

GRIFFIN
We’re going do it on the plane

Sal laughs Sees Griffin isn’t laughing

SAL
Youre out of your mind

GRIFFIN
No This is genius First of all
they’1ll never expect it And we
have access YOU have access

Sal looks confused for a split second then --

SAL
What My cousin Cesar The guy’s
just a baggage handler

GRIFFIN
Exactly Cargo security is the
weakest link in the chain Times
did a piece on it Everyone’s
trying to stop a shoe bomb or
exploding shampoo bottle when you
could load 50 lbs of C4 into the
cargo bay with a couple C-notes and
a twelve pack

Griffin shuts the trunk tosses Sal the phone
GRIFFIN

TARMAC-——

The BAGGAGE VEHICLE guarded by agents and cops rolls slowly
out to the awaiting AMERICAN AIRLINES AIRCRAFT

They load the caskets into the plane’s CARGO HOLD and drive
the baggage vehicle away

Then the CARGO flatbed rolls up and starts loading some CARGO
CRATES onto the plane

INT CARGO HOLD - MOMENTS LATER

The top of a CARGO CONTAINER opens and Griffin gets out Sal
gets out of another CONTAINER They quickly unload the gear
trying to maintain their balance as the plane ascends

While Griffin struggles to get everything set up Sal is
trying to pry the lock off TRAVIS’ COLD TRANSPORT CASKET
Both of them are FREEZING COLD their breath visible

SAL
My hands are numb

He finally gets it open Griffin takes off his shirt and
starts prepping himself

GRIFFIN
(shivering)
At least it’s already cold in
this bitch

Sal puts the ELECTRODE NET on Travis’ head Griffin fires up
his laptop and plugs everything in

And no deep six machine only a ROW OF SYRINGES taped to the
crate Griffin points at the first one --

GRIFFIN
Left to right just like a fancy
dinner Ever been to a fancy
dinner

SAL

Of course not I’ve only stared
longingly through the window
while I was gg gardening

Griffin smiles puts on his ELECTRODE NET and lies back
GRIFFIN
Remember six minutes after I

SMASH CUT TO

GRIFFIN’S DEEP SIX POV--

In the blackness the sound of the flatline heart monitor and
AIRPLANE FADE UP PICTURE FADES IN and we are FLOATING on the
ceiling of the cargo hold

Then THOUSANDS OF FILTHY BLOODY HANDS emerge from the
blackness TEARING AT US pulling us down into an OILY OCEAN
OF THICK BLACK LIQUID LIKE A TAR PIT

Millions of ANGRY VOICES accompany the hands furiously
screaming venomous threats and curses We FIGHT but they are
overpowering and we sink into the PIT gurgling and drowning
Suddenly we emerge and find ourselves moving down a --
HOUSING PROJECT HALLWAY--

The walls are covered with horrific graffiti and the carpet
is soaked in blood We walk fast through the hallway
stepping over EMACIATED DYING JUNKIES

The junkies have the same huge dark eyes that the demon
children had in Bea’s death experience We can see TRAVIS’
REFLECTION in their eyes as he -- WE -- push past

BACK TO

TRAVIS’ DEATH EXPERIENCE--

Griffin is back in the BURIAL BAR It’s pitch black A
constant RED STROBE flashes revealing the scene --

Everyone is DANCING but it’s more of a MOSH PIT -- very
violent with people smashing into walls and tables

He walks through the bar trying to take in as much as he can
about this Travis memory Find it’s meaning

Finally something gets his attention --

He’s looking at a WOMAN watching her DANCE She is covered
in TATTOOS that also seem to MOVE on her skin One of the
tattoos is a GUN and it SHIMMERS as if it’s real

CUT BACK TO

INT CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS

CUT BACK TO

TRAVIS’ DEATH EXPERIENCE--

GLITCHY FRAGMENTED IMAGES of BURIAL BAR cut with images of
Travis’ apartment We are back in --

TRAVIS’ POV--

The woman is dancing at the bar but Travis is having sex
with her in his apartment Her back is to him

Both scenes become very violent In the bar the dancing
woman is getting spattered with blood from all angles

At the climax of both scenes she whips her head around and
looks at us Looks at Travis --

IT’S SABINE

She has the empty demon eyes smiling and licking blood from
her lips We hear a guttural SCREAM as the reflection in her
eyes changes between Travis and Griffin screaming

Then we only see the BARREL of the GUN and the BLAST explodes
in our eyes and the scene is blown out WHITE

How was your flight

INT POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
Griffin handcuffed to a chair sits across from Charon

Griffin’s skin is ASHEN GRAY His face is drawn and he can
barely keep his head up There are small bloody cracks on his
hands and hairline

Charon has some of Griffin’s journals open on the table

CHARON
I want to help you But none of
what you’re saying is admissable in
court The world of the dead might
as was well be the land of Oz Or
more likely a figment of your
imagination You need to consider
that

Griffin lets out a long sigh of frustration

GRIFFIN
Youve probably been doing this
what Twenty years People must

lie to you all day long right

CHARON
Every time they open their mouths

GRIFFIN
So you’re an expert on the subject
(leans forward)
Look at me and tell me I’m lying

Griffin is shivering Charon pours him a cup of coffee
Slides it over

CHARON
It doesn’t matter how much you
believe the lies kid it still
doesn’t make them the truth

GRIFFIN
Well the truth is all I have for
you Sabine murdered Bea And when
she realized I was going to be a
large problem she set me up And I
handed her the perfect opportunity

He takes a drink

GRIFFIN
And she knew it I just about
killed Travis but I didn’t so she
did it for me You want evidence
DNA She had sex with him right
before she shot him You need to
bring her in detective

Charon picks up one of the journals

CHARON
And you know this because you saw
it in Travis Darrow’s
(reading)
Residual memory -- accessed via
synchronization with the deceased’s
postmortem residual brain waves

GRIFFIN
That’s exactly right

Griffin perks up feels a ray of hope Charon looks at him
for a long beat closes the journal --

CHARON
You know what I think I think if
you could pull off half the shit in
these journals you’d be sitting in
a chair across from Charlie Rose
talking about the Nobel Prize you
just won But you’re not in that
chair are you You’re cuffed to
this one looking at a pair of
murder ones

GRIFFIN
You know what I’m done Get my
lawyer please

CHARON
Have you seen yourself in the
mirror You look like death warmed
over Fact is I think you’re
probably a decent person but your
experiments have taken their toll
(MORE)

CHARON (CONTD)
Blurred reality Could easily drive
a man to kill Maybe if you just
get it off your chest

GRIFFIN
Lawyer NOW

CHARON
Have it your way
(stands up)
Oh yeah about Sabine We don’t
need to bring her in She came in
all by herself

GRIFFIN
She’s here Now

CHARON
Not really the move you make when
you have something to hide is it

Charon walks out Griffin closes his eyes briefly When he
does he sees SABINE’S DEMONIC FACE laughing into his
Griffin opens his eyes fights against the cuffs

Gibbs comes in finds Griffin on the floor his chair turned
over Helps him back up

GIBBS
Lawyer’s going to be a while Can I
get you anything

Griffin shakes his head Gibbs leaves him alone

OBSERVATION ROOM-- Charon is watching quietly Looks
conflicted His instinct says Griffin is being truthful He
just can’t accept what that means --

INT INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

Griffin sits across from his COURT APPOINTED DEFENSE
ATTORNEY A fresh legal pad and pencil sit untouched

GRIFFIN
What about bail

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
You haven’t been charged with
anything yet They’re passing on
the stowaway and evidence tampering
charges for now because you’d make
bail and they want you here

(MORE)
DEFENSE ATTORNEY (CONTD)
So they’re holding you on suspicion
of murder which gives them 36
hours to build a case And as of
now they don’t have much of one No
murder weapon for Darrow and
unless the Conrad autopsy tomorrow
morning contradicts

Griffin slams his hand down on the desk

GRIFFIN
You need to get me out of here
Tonight Right now There has to be
a way if they aren’t charging me

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
There isn’t Look we’ll go in
front of a judge on Tuesday and

GRIFFIN
Tuesday is too late

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
I’m sorry but it is what it is

Griffin sits back down defeated After a beat he starts
writing in the LEGAL PAD on the desk

GRIFFIN
Sal Garcia Has he been charged

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
Actually Mr Garcia has made a
deal with the District Attorney
He’s been released all major
charges dropped in exchange for
his testimony against you

GRIFFIN
(keeps writing)
Good That’s good Id like you to
deliver this to him immediately

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
What is it

GRIFFIN
An apology

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
What I strongly advise against
this It’s my obligation to

Griffin finishes the letter and hands it to him

fall within the law Correct

hold the stare for a long tense beat

ON SABINE-- She has a look of deep SATISFACTION on her face

CHARON
Where’d it turn up

GIBBS
Tweaker from Darrow’s squat tried
to sell it to an undercover cop
this morning Had some of Darrow’s
other stuff on him too

Charon looks at him knowingly

CHARON

And his swab came up negative for
powder residue Cause he didn’t
kill him

(Gibbs nods)
Probably heard the shot Found the
gun with the body and scavenged it
So now we think Darrow offd
himself

GIBBS
Looks that way Powder burns on his
hand and skull are consistent And
the kid was right about him having
sex just prior

(MORE)

GIBBS (CONTD)
The girl even admitted it says he
was distraught when she left but
swears she didn’t kill him

CHARON
And now it turns out neither did
Black In fact I don’t think he
was even there

into blackness The lights are dim and flickering

Griffin almost looks like a mirage His image is glitchy and
transparent He turns --

Beatrice is sitting in the bath crying A SYRINGE is on the
floor next to the tub along with several BEER BOTTLES

GRIFFIN
Bea

The heroin is still strong in her system Her eyelids are
heavy She tries to sit up straighter and slips down

She grabs her phone and tries to focus long enough to send a
text After struggling with it she throws the phone against
the wall smashing it

MEMORY FLASHES-—

Griffin sees what she is seeing - FLASHES of Travis drinking
kissing her and groping her while she is half paralyzed by

the drugs He is laughing There is one flash of her POV with
him directly over her his face red and smiling sadistically

END FLASHES
She is covering her eyes and shaking her head trying to

shake the memories Griffin can hear Travis’ voice in her
head

TRAVIS (VO)
I’m going to enjoy killing your new
boyfriend Maybe you can watch

Without consideration she grabs a beer bottle off the edge
of the tub and smashes it against the porcelain She takes
one of the glass shards and angrily plunges it into her arm
where the needle spike was

Then her mind clicks in as to what she just did and she
suddenly becomes very calm Instead of pulling the glass out
she starts to SLICE down her arm toward her wrist

ON GRIFFIN-- He looks gut punched Devastated His expression
changes as he thinks back Realizes he was WRONG

About everything --

Travis

Sabine

EVERYTHING

He COVERS HIS FACE UNABLE TO WATCH ANYMORE
Then from behind --

BEATRICE (0S)
I’m so sorry Griffin

He turns around She’s standing there She looks different
Like she did when he met her Bright eyed No longer afraid
He is torn with grief fighting back violent sobs

GRIFFIN
Beatrice No This isn’t happening
How could you How We had
something So much promise Our
future

She is crying now too

BEATRICE
I thought I was free From him
From my old life But I was wrong
Ive never felt so much shame
Griffin Somehow I allowed him to
destroy me And I was terrified he
would do the same to you

GRIFFIN
But we could have handled it
together

I tried to call you

GRIFFIN
I know I’m sorry So sorry I
should never have left you that
night I should have stayed

You are not responsible for this
Only I am And I wish I could take
it back but I can’t

GRIFFIN
It’s just not fair For the
first time in my life I wanted to
live Had a reason to live

BEATRICE
And you still do You have so much
life left in you I can feel it

GRIFFIN
I want to be with you I’m going to
be with you I don’t care about
anything else

She touches his face He touches her hand For a brief
moment this touch brings him more into view makes him less
transparent and glitchy

BEATRICE
You have to go back You don’t
belong here You have to go

GRIFFIN
No

BEATRICE
I’m always with you Always My
love is in your heart And not even
death can take that away

He squeezes her hand won’t let go Then from out of the
darkness they see a figure approaching --

The DARK FIGURE that Griffin saw watching Beatrice The
female figure he thought was Sabine

We see her face for the first time as she moves effortlessly
into the light A beautiful OLDER WOMAN

BEATRICE
Mom

BEATRICE’S MOTHER
Sweetheart

Beatrice weeps Her mother moves closer but doesn’t touch
her She waits patiently for her daughter

BEATRICE’S MOTHER
Come home with me

She holds out her hand Beatrice looks at Griffin

GRIFFIN
Wait

BEATRICE
Don’t worry
(whispers in his ear)
Every time you close your eyes
Ill be there

He closes his eyes and she softly kisses him for the last
time She tries to pull away but Griffin holds her tightly

GRIFFIN
I’m not letting you go Never
again
Beatrice starts to speak but Griffin pulls her close and
KISSES her with everything he has This is the kiss to end
all kisses --

All of his passion All of his desire Everything he’s done
in her name is focused into this one amazing moment

And it’s so intense that their images start to MELD TOGETHER

Beatrice’s mother slowly recedes into the darkness until she
is gone completely Then all of a sudden --

Griffin and Bea start to FALL into an ENDLESS ABYSS
Griffin holds Bea tight They are trying to speak to each
other yelling but their voices are drowned out by a

deafening roar of NOISE

They fall so fast they start to BLUR their bodies and
clothes becoming long vertical streaks of color

They go FASTER and DEEPER until all image light and sound
are absorbed into BLACKNESS

BACK TO

INT MORGUE - NIGHT

Sal is trying to revive Griffin He is working with the defib
paddles and epi shots

Everything is moving in SLOW MOTION Sal is saying something
to Griffin but we can’t hear him

ON HEART MONITOR--

Still in FLATLINE The sound of the flatline tone gets
LOUDER

Sal gives up

Throws his chair against the wall Punches the wall until his
fists are bloody

Grabs Griffin’s collar Holds his face SCREAMS --

SAL
WAKE UP

Heart monitor CHIRPS GRIFFIN OPENS HIS EYES

Sal lets out a huge sigh of relief Griffin gets his
bearings

SAL
Son of a bitch That’s the last
time I can’t take it anymore

GRIFFIN
(weak)

Told you Id be back You’re not

going to get rid of me that easy
SAL

Yeah well you might get rid of me

if you keep

Sal goes very pale all of the sudden

GRIFFIN
Sal Are you okay

Sal shakes his head NO Then motions to something he’s
looking at next to Griffin Griffin turns to see

BEATRICE’S EYES ARE OPEN

She is looking right at him

Griffin flinches startled out of his mind He slowly waves
his hand in front of her face --

HER EYES FOLLOW IT

GRIFFIN
I was right I can’t believe it

Sal is in a state of shock Griffin touches Bea’s hand
HER FINGERS CLOSE AROUND IT
FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT MIDTOWN NORTH PRECINCTLOCK UP - MOMENTS LATER
SURVEILLANCE ROOM--

CHARON and GIBBS step in Officer Sharp shakes their hands
The screen is now frozen on the moment when the guard
discovers Griffin dead

OFFICER SHARP
(to guard)
Back it up please

The Guard at the controls REWINDS the footage and you see
Griffins suicide IN REVERSE

OFFICER SHARP
This is the suicide

CHARON
(annoyed)
Okay Pretty much what we thought
happened

OFFICER SHARP
That’s not what I wanted you to
see
(to guard)
Run it back to my time code stamp

Guard SPEED REWINDS and FREEZES on a spot where Griffin is
sitting on his cot staring into space

OFFICER SHARP
Right there Okay run it

ON VIDEO SCREEN-- It starts playing at normal speed There
audio and we hear the “lights out in five” call Griffin
climbs up on the bunk --

AND LOOKS RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA

He starts to speak evenly but not loud his voice barely
cutting through the sounds of the other prisoners

GRIFFIN
(voice shaking)
Detective Charon By now you’ve
read the rest of my journals and
you know about the Omegas

Loud TAUNTING from the other inmates on the block

GRIFFIN
QUIET

His voice is so LOUD and MENACING that it actually does
elicit some quiet from the other inmates

He looks back at the camera --

GRIFFIN
I want you to know that I was wrong
about Omegas They’re not residual
brainwaves They are of unknown

origin And very powerful -- like
pure energy that can never be
destroyed

(beat)
And I believe we may be able to
give them to each other Like

sharing a breath
He looks away Thinks for a beat then --

GRIFFIN

This may be the last time you see
me alive so I’m entrusting my
journals to you You have no idea
how important they are

(beat)
But I have a feeling you’re about
to find out

Charon and Gibbs look at each other Griffin steps off the
bed Back into the DARKNESS of his cell

FADE TO BLACK

THE END

is
