Chasing Amy

Written by Kevin Smith

INT COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY
A pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad

others

CHRONIC

The most prominent one is called BLUNTMAN AND
A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame

HOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his
head BANKY looks over his shoulder

BANKY
Felt Like this fucking day would never
come Issue two - on the shelf
HOLDEN
Yippee
BANKY

Dont start alright This is a cool
moment and Id appreciate you not
trying to ruin it How often does
a guy get the opportunity to purchase
something with his name on it

(points to name on cover)
Banky Edwards- right

(points to the other)
Holden McNeil

HOLDEN
I know my name
BANKY

Cmon sour puss We got the rest of
our lives to be artists But its
supply and demand And right now
the unwashed masses demand this

HOLDEN
(off comic)
This is easy alright And right now
it pays the bills Just dont forget
that were better than this
BANKY
Ill tell you who were better than
these two fags right here

They approach the counter where STEVE-DAVE the store

manager

and WALT the Fan-boy play a card game

BANKY
(lays books on the counter)
Alright Old-Maids - take a break from
the Crazy-8s marathon and ring us up
STEVE-DAVE
(not looking up)

Well wellwell Walt Did you see who
it is The local celebrities Quick -
get them to autograph one of their
books so we can sell it for triple
its value
WALT
Im not that in need of fifteen cents
right now
They snicker and high-five one another Holden rolls his
eyes
BANKY
You guys operate the smallest ladies
bridge circle Ive ever seen

WALT
For your information were playing
Crimson Mystical Mages - an

overpower card game Not that either
of you would give a shit about
something as advanced as this -
there are no dick or poopie jokes
involved

BANKY

(to Holden)

I dont think theyre fans

WALT
No were not Youre both a couple
of fucking no talents that got lucky

STEVE-DAVE
And obviously your handlers or hangers-
on convinced you that your first comic
was good which it was not it was
thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky
bits of dialogue And when you get
your foot in the door of the business
what do you do You turn out a piece
of shit like Bluntman and Chronic

WALT
Tell him Steve-Dave

STEVE-DAVE

(off comic)
Bluntman and Chronic Pah

What was that thing the little stoner
pulled on the villain in the last

issue
WALT

The Stinky-palm
STEVE-DAVE

Stinky-palm You give comics a bad
name I tell all my customers not to
buy it to spend their money on a real
comic book

WALT
Fucking one hit wonder dime-store
Frank Millers
STEVE-DAVE
This is the reality at Comic-Toast -
youre not going to get your ass
kissed here because both me and Walt
think you suck
WALT
And me
STEVE-DAVE
I said that
Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers then
goes back to playing his game with Walt Holden and
Banky stare shocked Banky nudges Holden and they both
exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to
playing
WALT
Ive got a dragon card - forty power-
ups and twelve life points Ha I
get your elf card
STEVE-DAVE
Youre such a bitch But thankfully
Ive saved a dark forces Shaman card
for just such an occasion
WALT
You suck Eighty six life-power
points to my twenty two
STEVE-DAVE
I schooled their asses now Im
schooling yours
Suddenly A trash can crashes through the front window
Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches covering
one another They look up slowly Steve-Dave leaps to
his feet and looks at the shattered mess He pulls
something off the garbage can and reads it
WALT
You know it was those two fucks
Lets call the cops and have them
busted I know where their studio is
Or better yet lets sue You can sue
them Steve-Dave
STEVE-DAVE
(still reading note)
That wont be necessary

WALT
What Why the hell not
STEVE-DAVE

(holds up check)
Because this is a check for three
times what that window cost
(reading note)
Dear critics - thanks for the
insight But like my grandmother

always said - Fuck em if they cant
take a joke and break their window
Kiss it Banky the Hack
PS - Your card game blows

WALT

He said Kiss it
CREDITS
INT COMIC BOOK CONVENTION SIGNING BOOTH - DAY
A physically large FAN - sweaty brow tote bag bursting

with comics - leans forward smiling
FAN

fan

Holden sits at a table Across from the barely-managing-
to-stand Fan He offers him a patronizingly kind half-
smile in return
HOLDEN
You bet
Were at a Comic Book show specifically at a book-
signing Behind Holden hangs a large banner heralding
HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS -
CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC Beside it is a large
mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner
super-heroes who bear a
striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly
neighborhood drug
dealers Holden hands the book back to the Fan
FAN
I love this book man This shits
awesome I wish I was like these guys
- getting stoned talking all raw
about chicks and fighting
supervillains I love these guys

BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR
COLLECTOR

(signing the comic)
I ink it and Im also the colorist
The guy next to me draws it But we
both came up with the characters
Banky freezes
signing

COLLECTOR
Whats that mean - you ink it
BANKY
Well It means that Holden draws the
pictures in pencil and then he gives
it to me to go over in ink
COLLECTOR
So you just trace
up He composes himself and continues

BANKY
Its not tracing I add depth and
shading to give the image mere
definition Only then does the drawing
really take shape
COLLECTOR
You go over what he draws with a pen -
thats tracing
BANKY
(hands book back to
Collector)
Not really
(calling out)

Next

A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers

COLLECTOR
Hey man If somebody draws something
and then you draw the same thing right
on top of it not going out-side the
designated original art what do call
that

LITTLE KID
(shrugs)
I dont know Tracing
COLLECTOR
(to Banky)

BANKY

COLLECTOR
Oh but it is
BANKY

(to Little Kid)

Do you want Lour book signed or what

COLLECTOR
Hey - dont get all testy with him
just because you have a problem with
your station in life

BANKY

COLLECTOR
Then say it - youre a tracer
BANKY
(grabbing Little Kids book)
How should I sign this
LITTLE KID
(grabs book back)
I dont want you to sign it I want
the guy that draws Bluntman and
Chronic to sign it Youre just a
tracer
COLLECTOR
Tell him Little Shaver
Holden accepts a comic from another Fan
HOLDEN
(off comic)
Who do I sign it to
Before Holden can finish a loud crash is heard He
looks to his left and freaks
Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table
The Collector attempts to fight him off SECURITY GUARDS
pull them apart Holden grabs Banky

COLLECTOR
Jesus All I did was call hima

BANKY

them then we have no audience
BANKY
He started it Fucking cock-knocker
Hes lucky I didnt put my pen through
his thorax
HOLDEN
Need I remind you
(holds up watch)
Curtains in ten minutes

INT COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY
HOOPER fills the frame He comes off like a typical pro-
blackanti-white homeboy
HOOPER
For years in this industry whenever an
African-American character - hero or
villain - was introduced usually by
white artists and writers - they got
slapped with racist names that singled
them out as negroes Black Panther
Black Lightning Black Goliath Black
Mantra Black Talon Black Spider
Black Hand Black Falcon Black Cat
VOICE FROM CROWD
Shes white
HOOPER
She is
(beat)
Well bust this - regardless
Were at a panel discussion The room is full Five
creators sit at a long table their names on placards in
front of them

(One of them is a very striking Girl) The banner behind
them reads WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS
HOOPER

(holds up comic)
Now my book White-Hating Coon
doesnt have any of that bullshit The
heros name is Maleekwa and hes a
descendant of the black tribe that
established the first society on the
planet while all you European mother
fuckers were still hiding in caves and
shit all terrified of the sun Hes a
strong role model that a young black
reader can look up to Cause Im here
to tell you - the chickens are comin
home to roost yall the black mans
no longer gonna play the minstrel in
the medium of comics and Sci-
FiFantasy Were keeping it real
and were gonna get respect -
by any means necessary
During the speech Holden and Banky enter and sit up
front
HOLDEN
(calling out)
Bullshit Lando Calrissian was a
black man and he got to fly the
Millennium Falcon
Hooper whips his head around looking for the source of
the comment

HOOPER
Who said that

HOLDEN

(standing)

I did Lando Calrissian is a positive
black role model in the realm of
Science FictionFantasy

HOOPER
Fuck Lando Calrissian Uncle Tom
nigger Always some white boy gotta
invoke the holy trilogy Bust this -
those movies are about how the white
man keeps the brother man down - even
in a galaxy far far away Check
this shit You got cracker farm-boy
Luke Skywalker Nazi poster boy -
blond hair blue eyes
And then youve got Darth
Vader the blackest brother in the
galaxy Nubian God
BANKY
Whats a Nubian
HOOPER
Shut the fuck up Now Vader hes a
spiritual brother with the force and
all that shit Then this cracker
Skywalker gets his hands on a light-
saber and the boy decides hes
g
a
t
t

onna run the fucking universe - gets
whole Klan of whites together and
heyre gonna bust up Vaders hood
he Death Star Now what the fuck do
you call that

BANKY
Intergalactic Civil War

HOOPER
Gentrification Theyre gonna drive
our the black element to make the
galaxy quote unquote safe for white
folks

HOLDEN
But Vader turns out to be Lukes
father And in Jedi they become
friends

HOOPER
Dont make me bust a cap in your ass
yo Jedis the most insulting
installment because Vaders
beautiful black visage is
sullied when he pulls off his mask to
reveal a feeble crusty white man
Theyre trying to tell us that deep
inside we all want to be white
BANKY
Well isnt that true
Hooper explodes He pulls a nine millimeter from his
belt draws on Banky and fires Banky goes down falling
forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to
scatter Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists
in the air
HOOPER
BLACK RAGE BLACK RAGE ILL KILL
ANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER
FUCKIN EYES ON
The crowd-is gone Holden sits in his chair laughing
Hooper steps off the stage and picks Bankys head up off
the floor
HOOPER
(breaking character)
Whats a Nubian Bitch you almost
made me laugh
Hooper sounds different Actually he sounds gay
Actually - he is Banky smiles
BANKY
Well what about you You didnt tell
me you were going to scream Black
Rage I nearly pissed myself
HOLDEN
How do you manage to get away with
this all the time Shouldnt cops be
busting your head open right about

now
BANKY
Wrong coast
HOOPER
(off gun)

Well this right here - she full of
blanks okay And Opiate gets all
sorts of legal clearances before I go

on

HOLDEN
Your publisher condones these
theatrics

HOOPER

Condones Honey they insist I need
to sell the image to sell the book
Would the audience still buy the
Black Rage angle if they found out
the book was written by a a
BANKY
Faggot
HOOPER
When you say if it sounds so sexy
(he kisses Banky full on the
lips)
BANKY
(wipes his lips)
Hey hey Ill play your victim but
not your catcher
VOICE
How is it that you sound like Minister
Farakhan when youre on stage
They turn to see
A beautiful blonde ruffled-haired angel swinging her
purse in a circle Her name is ALYSSA Shes the
striking Girl from the panel who didnt get to say much

ALYSSA
and the King of Pop when youre
nor

HOOPER
Look out boys - this kitten has a
whip

ALYSSA

(shoves and slaps him)

Always before I get to speak I swear
- the next con I attend and they ask
me to be on the minority panel if I
see your name anywhere near the List
Im passing

HOOPER

(defending himself)
Holden Banky - this pile of PMS
is Alyssa Jones She does that book
Idiosyncratic Routine This is the

fourth panel weve been on together
and even though she knows my publisher
sets this up and pays for the event
She still gets mad when it ends with
my act
ALYSSA
I just wish I was the one who gets to
shoot you
HOOPER
Thats what my father said when I came
- nay - leapt out of the closet
(off guys)
These boys do Bluntman and Chronic’
which outsells both of our books put

together hence theyre never ona

panel with the likes of us They

slumming right now

BANKY

Ive read your book Its cute

Chick stuff but cute
Holden hits him

BANKY
What
HOLDEN
(shoots him a look to
Alyssa)
Sorry about him Hes dealing with
being an inker
ALYSSA
(to Banky)
Oh You trace
Banky seethes
HOLDEN
(shaking her hand)
really enjoy your book Im surprised
weve never met at any other Cons
before
ALYSSA
Lose the dick or change your skin tone
and we can get to know each other on
panel after panel while the Pink Black
Panther here plays Chuck D for the
fanboys
HOOPER

Hey jealousy

(to the Boys)
I told Alyssa Id buy her a post-rave
drink Do the Garden-Staters have to
sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel or can
you stay for a round in the big scary

city
BANKY

Were gonna take off soon
HOLDEN

Well go

Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance Then he nods to
Hooper
BANKY
Well go
INT BAR - NIGHT
Holden Banky Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table
drinking talking and smoking
BANKY
Archie alright Archie and the
Riverdale gang were a pure and fun-
lovin bunch You cant find
dysfunction in those comics because
they were just flat out wholesome
HOOPER
Archie and Jughead were lovers
(sips his drink)
BANKY
Shut the fuck up
HOOPER
Its true Archie was the bitch and
Jughead was the butch - thats why
Jughead wears that crown-looking hat
all the time he the king of queen
Archies world
BANKY
Man I feel a hate-crime coming on
HOLDEN
Hes got a point Archie never did
settle on Betty or Veronica
BANKY
Because he wanted them both at the
same time you assholes He never
chose one because he was trying to get
both of them into a three-way
HOOPER
(pulls out a dollar and hands
it to Banky)

Here I want you to go down to the
corner store and buy yourself a clue
Go on

BANKY
Eat it Urkel

HOOPER

I told you to watch it with that Urkel
shit Face it girl - Archies a
sister

BANKY

(getting up to Hooper)

Thats it You

HOOPER
Moi

BANKY
You are marching back across the
street with me and were going to
pick up a shit load of Archie books I
am going to prove to you - beyond the
shadow of a doubt that Archie was all
about pussy Come on

HOOPER

(sliding out of booth)
This boy is conflicted I shall play
mother-therapist for him You two sit
tight We shall return promptly
Banky and Hooper exit leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at
the table

ALYSSA
Is he always Like that

HOLDEN
For years now Started back in third
grade - a nun was teaching us about
the Blessed Trinity Shes going on
Alyssa laughs

AT THE

A dart
board

Alyssa
always

about the three persons in one God
thing - Father Son Holy Spirit - and
he just goes ballistic I guess it
was too big for him to grasp They
got into this huge fight

ALYSSA
Please How bad could it have been

HOLDEN
You ever seen a nun call a small child
a fucking cunt-rag Wasnt pretty
Shit like thats bound to happen when
you make a kid wear a matching tie and
slacks everyday

ALYSSA
And your parochial school
misadventures

HOLDEN
Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass
Turned me into a grade school
alcoholic altar boy I couldnt tell
you how many mornings after serous
benders Id wake up next
to strange priests

ALYSSA
Arent you the sharp wit

HOLDEN
Sharp No Im just a fan of clergy-
molestation humor Probably why the
extended family quit inviting me to
First Communion parties

Holden smiles
ALYSSA
(looking OC)

You play darts

HOLDEN
Not professionally You know - only
in bars

DART BOARD

hits the board then one hits the wall beside

winds up with another dart Holden watches

hit

His never do

ALYSSA
So your new book seems to be selling
like mad

the

Hers
HOLDEN
It goes back to something my
grandmother told me when I was a kid
Holden she said The big bucks are
in dick and fart jokes She was a
church-goer

ALYSSA

Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a
real artist trapped in commercial hell
- pitying his good fortune Im sure
you can dry your eyes on all those fat
checks you rake in

HOLDEN
Im sorry - did I detect a note of
bitter envy in there

ALYSSA
Nope Im happy my stuff gets read at
all Theres very little market for
hearts and flowers in this spandex-
clad big pecs big tits big guns
field If I sell two issues I feel
like John Grisham

HOLDEN
(looking out window)
Its all about marketing Over- or
underweight guys who dont get laid -
theyre our bread and butter People
like those two outside should be
yours

Through the window we see a COUPLE making out on the

hood of a car

HOLDEN

And sadly there are more of our core
audience out there than yours

(smiles)
Look at that though - kind of gives
you a little charge to see two people
in love And all over Bankys car no
less That cars seeing more action
right now than its seen in years

ALYSSA
Bubbly guy like that its hard to
figure out why

HOLDEN
(still looking at OC Couple)
Youve gotta respect that kind of
display of affection Its crazy
rude self-absorbed - but its love

ALYSSA
Thats not love

HOLDEN
Says you

ALYSSA
That out there Thats fleeting

HOLDEN
Fleeting

ALYSSA
Uh-huh You wanna hear about love
Oh Ill tell you about love

HOLDEN
A story

ALYSSA
The story The original love story

HOLDEN
Doctor Zhivago

ALYSSA
Nope My mothers uncle He was a
millionaire

HOLDEN
Get out

ALYSSA
I kid you not

HOLDEN
Explain

ALYSSA

All through high school he dated this
one girl They were inseparable

And when they graduated she went off
to Carnegie Mellon

HOLDEN
In Pittsburgh
ALYSSA
Im impressed So he stays in the
home town and they begin their long-
distance relationship The plan is
on the third Sunday of every month
hell train out spend a week then
train back They do this for four
years

HOLDEN
That is love

ALYSSA
Not nearly finished Two months
before shes going to graduate hes
got this job digging graves and he
comes across

HOLDEN
A stiff

ALYSSA
A steamer trunk containing silver
ingots

HOLDEN
Get out of here

ALYSSA
Many many silver ingots Now my
mothers uncle being quite the
ingenious chap - he buries the trunk
again and heads up to the main office
where he proceeds to purchase a
cemetery plot Guess which one

HOLDEN
Clever

ALYSSA
So now he owns the plot and all of its
contents Two days later my
mothers uncle is worth three million

HOLDEN
At which time he marries the high
school sweetheart and lives happily
ever after

ALYSSA
Not even close Inside the steamer
trunk stenciled into the wood or
something like that is a curse

HOLDEN
Someone wrote Fuck inside his new
steamer trunk

ALYSSA
Not that kind of curse A cryptic
curse Great fortune means great loss
it said

HOLDEN
What kind of asshole writes that
inside a steamer trunk

ALYSSA
The same kind of asshole that buries
silver ingots The day my mothers

uncle is heading out to see the girl
he stops at his accountants to grab
some cash and winds up missing his
train So he has to take the next one
- which he does - and he gets there an
hour later than his usual time of
arrival whereupon he sees lights

HOLDEN
A heros welcome for the new
millionaire

ALYSSA

It seems that while she was standing
on the platform waiting that extra
hour for my mothers uncle to show up
the girl was dragged into the bushes
by an unknown assailant raped and
gutted

Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink

ALYSSA
The assailant was never apprehended

HOLDEN
(beat)
Thats a love story

ALYSSA
Yes and heres why my mothers uncle
rode that train every day for the rest
of his life One day up the next day
back Did that till the day he died
He donated the fortune hed acquired
to the train station in Pittsburgh to
have a well-lit terminal built

The train line let him ride for free
after that

HOLDEN
should hope so Jesus thats the
saddest tale Ive ever heard

ALYSSA
Thats my love story

fq

Alyssa tosses her last dart Holden seems a bit dazed
He looks out the window

HOLDEN
Those two arent on the hood of
Bankys car anymore

fq

ALYSSA

told you It wasnt love

(grabs her purse)
gotta split It was really nice
meeting you wish you the best of
luck with your book
(shakes his hand)
Tell Hooper Ill call him later And
tell your friend to calm down

Alyssa exits to the night Holden stares after her Two
beats later Hooper and Banky enter holding an
Everythings Archie comic between them

BANKY
Youre insane Archie is not fucking

HOOPER
Deny deny deny
(to Holden)

Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper

HOOPER

HOLDEN

HOOPER

HOLDEN
Shes alright

HOOPER
As long as thats all
(finishes drink)
Maybe you can convince that partner of
yours to drop me off downtown before
you scurry out the tunnel

HOLDEN
(beat)
Mister Weatherbee wasnt really trying
to fuck Archie was he
They begin exiting

HOOPER
Hell no Weatherbee was Reggies
bitch
INT STUDIO - DAY

rented loft-style place with high ceilings wood floors
and sparse furnishings There are posters on the walls

huge comfy couch and two drawing boards with adjacent
desks (littered with pencils pens coloring pencils
paints erasers etc) - at which sit Holden and Banky

Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch-
nemesis - the Giggler Holden erases a line and re-
draws

CU OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder we see Banky
outlining a pre-penciled page He traces Bluntman
swinging from a street light

The two work in silence Then

The Sand stops playing People clap

ALYSSA
Coulda been worse - we could have not
met at all

Holden looks at her

OC SINGER
Thank you Thanks

The SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone

SINGER
A long time ago we used to have this
bass player who took off one day to
draw funny books or something Maybe
youve seen her stuff - its called
Idiosyncratic Routine

The crowd applauds Alyssa shakes her head smiling
Holden pokes her

SINGER
But what a lot of people dont know is
that she used to harbor these
delusions that she could sing And
she used to subject us to these
throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson
tunes and shit insisting that we let
her front on a few numbers Well we
didnt and she quit and then she got
famous the bitch

(crowd laughs)
But shes here tonight and I think if
we all begged or maybe offered her
some X shed get up here and treat us
to some of her vocal stylings

(crowd applauds)
What do you say Alyssa

Alyssa shakes her head no The crowd urges her Holden
pushes her forward

SINGER
Shes shy
(yelling)
GET UP HERE AND SING BITCH

The crowd thunders Alyssa offers the Singer an
embarrassed half-smile She looks at Holden who claps
along with the others and nods toward the stage Alyssa
shakes her head and relents heading through the crowd

Banky and Hooper stand at the bar

BANKY
This is so queer
(he exits)

HOOPER
(beat)
You dont know the half of it

Alyssa jumps on stage hugging the Singer She takes the
mic shaking her head The crowd is applauding

ALYSSA
She is such a twat

The crowd cheers Alyssa laughs She turns to the band
and says something which they nod She turns back to the
crowd

ALYSSA
Alright I should dedicate this
right
(thinks)
This is for that special someone our
there
Holden smiles Banky joins him Holden glances at him
Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile

The band starts playing Cross cutting begins

Alyssa launches into a torchy tune The song is
extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic making
direct eye contact with

Holden Or does she Holden is smiling being seduced
Banky rolls his eyes Beside Holden stands a pretty
GIRL with a short haircut whos also riveted by Alyssas
performance

Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out
there

The song seems to be aimed at whoever shes looking at
Its more than obvious theres a seduction going on bur
of whom At the end of the song the crowd goes wild but
Alyssas preoccupied She points to someone in the
crowd and curls her finger back in a cmere fashion
urging whoever it is to join her She jumps off the
stage

Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward aw-
shucks style At that moment the Girl beside him leaps
forward Bankys eyes widen Holden looks up and is
suddenly taken aback

Alyssa and the Girl race into each others arms and fall
into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss

Holdens eyes bug Banky allows a smile to creep across
his face The crowd applauds Banky looks around and
for the first time we get the distinct impression that
this is a lesbian bar

There are a lot of chicks in this place Gay chicks
Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back

BANKY
Now that my friend is a
(brings his fingers together
mimicing Holden)
Shared moment

Holden continues to stare - mouth agape

Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss
INT HER-STERECTOMY - LATER

Banky Holden Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor
sit around a table Alyssa and the Girl continue to make
out Holden and Banky casually watch wide-eyed Banky
stares a little harder Holden hits him

BANKY
What

HOLDEN
(under his breath)
Thats rude

BANKY
Man when are we ever going to get a
chance to see this kind of shit live
without paying for it

Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss

ALYSSA
Uh-oh - better knock it off were
getting a man excited

HOLDEN
Sorry Its just new to him

BANKY
Oh and youre an old hand at this

ALYSSA
No I should apologize I dont
usually get all mushy in public But
its been awhile since Ive seen Kim
here

KIM
(formerly the Girl)
Tell me you didnt set that gross
display up with the band just so you
could nail me

ALYSSA
Like Id have to go through that much
effort

KIM
You know what I want to dance

ALYSSA
Go ahead Ill watch from here
KIM
(tugging at her arm)
No I want to dance with you

ALYSSA
Dont be such a rag I have to sit
here and work up the desire to fuck
you later

KIM
Please

Kim exits Banky is smiling ear-to-ear Alyssa looks at
him

ALYSSA
Yes
BANKY
You said fuck To that girl You

said youd fuck her

ALYSSA
And

BANKY
How can a girl fuck another girl
Were you talking about strap-ons or
something

HOLDEN
(hits him)
Would you shut up

BANKY
What Its a valid question You
know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse
Letters section is written by guys -
this is our chance to get the inside
scoop

HOLDEN
(to Alyssa)
I dont know how many times I can
apologize for him

ALYSSA
Its okay Secretly all I really
want is to be the center of attention
(to Banky)
Ive never used a snap-on
BANKY
Then whats with saying fuck
Shouldnt you say eat her out or at
least modify the term fuck with
something like fist

ALYSSA
Let me ask you a question - can men
fuck each other

BANKY
Ask Hooper

ALYSSA
In your estimation

BANKY
Sure

ALYSSA
So for you to fuck means to
penetrate Youre used to the more
traditional definition - you inside
some girl youve duped jack-hammering
away not noticing that bored look in
her eyes

BANKY
Hey - I always notice the bored look
in their eyes

ALYSSA

(laughs)
Fucking is nor limited to
penetration Banky For me it
describes any sex when its not
totally about love I dont love Kim
but Ill fuck her Im sure you dont
love every girl you sleep with

BANKY
Some of them I downright loathe

ALYSSA
But Ill bet its different with the
ones you love Ill bet you go the
full nine when its not just a quick
fix - like you go down on them longer
or something

HOLDEN
Here we go

BANKY
I dont do that

ALYSSA
What

BANKY
I stopped dropping It got to be too
frustrating

HOLDEN
As stupid as you usually come off
during this diatribe of yours youre
going to come off ten times as stupid
on this occasion

BANKY
What I lost my tolerance for the
bullshit baggage that comes with
eating girls out Whats the big
deal

ALYSSA
If you say the smell so help me Ill
slug you

BANKY
Not the smell - the smell is good
Im talking about not being able to do
it property And my mother brought me
up to believe that if I cant do
something
right I shouldnt do it at all Of
course my father told me she gave
lousy head but thats beside the
point

ALYSSA
At least you blame yourself for your
sexual inadequacies

BANKY
No I blame them Chicks never help
you out They never tell you what to
do And most of them are self-
conscious about that smell factor and
so most of the time they just lay
there frozen like a deer in the
headlights right Not for nothing
but when a chick goes down on me I
let her know where to go and what the
status is You gotta handle it like
CNN and the Weather Channel - constant
updates

HOLDEN
Youre such an idiot

ALYSSA
No hes got a point Thats how I
was in high school - I was nervous
and inhibited about being eaten out
But by the time I got to college that
all changed I loosened up Not only
did I learn to communicate - I learned
to be bossy
I was like one of those guys at the
airport with those big flash lights -
waving them this way directing them
that way telling them when to stop

BANKY
And thats all Im saying itd be
different if chicks helped out -
pointed a guy in the right direction
Then thered be no bullshit no wasted
time and no chance for permanent
injuries

ALYSSA
Permanent injuries

BANKY

Sure You wanna see something
permanent

(pulls our front tooth)

I got this from Nina Rollins
sophomore year Im going down on
her and out of nowhere her cat jumps
on her stomach She does this big ol
pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in
half sends it down my throat I had
to get a crown for the stub

ALYSSA

(to Holden)
I got that beat

(to Banky)
I got that beat

(half-turns and lifts chin)
Sophomore year Im going down on
Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after
we went club-hopping Im totally
drunk and in the middle of it I fall
asleep - right there in her lap She
got so mad she digs her heel into my
back right there

(points to scar)
Thats permanent

BANKY

You see this

(moves neck slightly right)
Thats the farthest I can move my neck
to the right Sophomore year Im going
out with Maria Bennert and for six
months Im going down on her and not
a damn things happening
Then one night I change a position
or vary my lapping-speed and suddenly
its a whole new world Shes moving
around convulsing breathing heavy
And her legs are pressing against my
ears so tightly that I dont hear her
father come into the room He grabs
my hair

(grabs his own hair and pulls

back)
and he pulls me way back hard

ALYSSA

(throws up her leg and rolls

up pants)
Senior year Spring Formal Im
eating our Missy Kurt in her brothers
car Shes laying across the bac
seat and Im half-hanging out of the
car my knees on the ground Shes
flailing around and she knocks the
parking brake off The car starts
rolling down the hill and my right
knee is cut up all to shit like a
kiddys scissor class cut it up for
paper dolls

Banky and Alyssa laugh Holden looks at a small scar on
his arm and thinks better about mentioning it Then Kim
re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssas neck

HOLDEN
(off Bankys watch)
Holy shit is that the time Weve
gotta beat traffic
BANKY
What traffic - its one thirty in the

morning
HOLDEN

(getting up)
And rush hour starts in six hours
Lets go

(to Alyssa)
Thanks for inviting us out It was
educational

Alyssa waves at him as he exits Banky slides out of the
booth

BANKY
(to Kim)
Since you like chicks right
do you just look at yourself in the
mirror all the time

Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out Alyssa watches
them go then turns and kisses Kim

INT M-TV EXECS OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY

Chronic cartoons The age of Beavis

Even more retarded and juvenile to
sate the voracious intellectually-
challenged miscreants that make up
your key demographic

The Execs laugh hard Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and
gives the thumbs up

EXEC 1
(composes himself)
So what do you say Are we in
business

Banky leans back into the couch wearing a thoughtful

face He looks to Holden then to Sloss Sloss nods in
understanding
SLOSS

minutes

HOLDEN
Is this how you want to be remembered
As the guy who created Bluntman and
Chronic

Banky sits at the Execs desk and starts rifling through
the guys stuff

BANKY
No Id like to be remembered as the
filthy rich guy who created Bluntman
and Chronic
HOLDEN
But itll be all glossy and main-
stream Well lose any artistic
credibility we ever had

SLOSS
(to Banky)
Is it me I dont see the problem

BANKY
(to Sloss)
He just has to get over this crush of
his

SLOSS
Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again

naked woman)
Look at this - Mrs M-TV Exec has a
string of pearls hanging our of her

ass
SLOSS
Would you leave his stuff alone
(to Holden)

You can break her resolve killer
All it takes is one good man But if
it takes two good men dont hesitate
to call me That being said in
regards to the more pressing issue I
suggest you leave art to the museums
and grab on with both hands to the
big fat check

HOLDEN
Ill give it some thought

BANKY

(holding up Polaroid)
Im taking this as a precaution - just
in case they give us any shit about
pussys decision delay

(glaring at Holden)
Youll give it some thought Youre
so retarded

HOLDEN
Im retarded This from the guy who
only forty five minutes ago paid fifty
bucks for whats supposed to be a boot-
leg of March of the Wooden Soldiers
with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel
wearing a French Tickler

SLOSS
Howd you fall for that

BANKY

The guy who sold it to me had an
honest face

INT STUDIO - DAY
There is a door Theres a knock at the door Holden
opens it and Alyssa is standing there

ALYSSA
Somebody told me that they make comic
books here and Ive got an idea for
this story about a guy who comes to a
club and high-tails it when he finds
out this girl is pay Any interest in
a story like that

Holden smiles

EXT RIVERFRONT PARK - DAY
Alyssa and Holden walk through the park eating hot dogs

ALYSSA

HOLDEN
Twelve episodes

ALYSSA
Thats great isnt it

HOLDEN
Banky seems to think so

ALYSSA
But you dont

They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings

HOLDEN
I dont know if thats the perception
I want people to have of our stuff I
know this sounds pretentious as hell
but I like to think of us as artists
And Id like to get back to doing
something more personal - like our
first book

ALYSSA
Well when are you going to do that

HOLDEN
(beat)
As soon as we have something personal
to say
ALYSSA
Do you know how pretty you are

HOLDEN
What

ALYSSA
Youre a pretty man

HOLDEN
Uh thanks

ALYSSA
Oh I get it Im into girls so I
have to find all men repulsive or
something

HOLDEN
I didnt say anything

ALYSSA
Arent there some men that you find
attractive Granted not enough to
sleep with but still - just handsome
or something

HOLDEN
Sure Harrison Ford And our mail-
man

ALYSSA

Well its the same thing I look at
you and just find you really handsome
And you know it has very little to do
with your look per-se Your look is
fine dont get me wrong But its
more your outlook The things you
say the way you see things Its
I dont know attractive

Holden looks away embarrassed

ALYSSA
I weirded you our the other night

HOLDEN
Huh No not really

ALYSSA
Come on
HOLDEN
(beat)
Its just that weve I mean Ive
never seen that kind of thing up close
and personal It just took awhile to
process longer than usual

ALYSSA
Do you want to talk about it

HOLDEN
Um If you want to

ALYSSA
I like you I havent liked a man in
a long time And Im not a man-hater
or something Its just been some
time since Ive been exposed to a man
that didnt immediately live-into a
stereotype of some sort And I want
you to feel comfortable with me
because I want us to be friends So
if there are things youd like to
know its okay to ask me

HOLDEN
(beat)
Why girls
ALYSSA
(beat)
Why men
HOLDEN

Because thats the standard

ALYSSA
If thats the only reason youre
attracted to women - because its the
standard

HOLDEN
Its more than that

ALYSSA
So youve never been curious about
men

HOLDEN
Curious about men Well I always
wondered why my father watched Hee-
Haw
ALYSSA
You know what I mean

HOLDEN
No

ALYSSA
Why not

HOLDEN
No interest

ALYSSA
Because

HOLDEN

Girls feel right

ALYSSA
And thats how I feel Ive never
really been attracted to men Im
more comfortable with the idea of
girls

HOLDEN
Wait wait wait - youre stilla
virgin

ALYSSA
No

HOLDEN
But youve only been with girls

ALYSSA
Youre saying a persons a virgin
until theyve had intercourse with a
member of the opposite sex

HOLDEN
Isnt that the standard definition

ALYSSA
Again with the standards I think
virginity is lost when you make love
for the first time

HOLDEN
With a member of the opposite sex

ALYSSA
Why Why only then

HOLDEN
Because thats the standard

ALYSSA
So if a virgin is raped then shes
still a virgin

HOLDEN
Of course not

ALYSSA
But rape is not the standard So
shes had sex but not the standard
idea of sex Hence according to
your definition shed still be a
virgin

HOLDEN
Okay Ill revise Virginity is lost
when the hymen is broken

ALYSSA
Then I lost my virginity at ten
because I fell on a fence post when I
was ten and it broke my hymen Now I
have to tell people that I lost it to
a wooden post Id known my whole young
life

HOLDEN
Second revision - virginity is lost
through penetration

ALYSSA
Physical penetration or emotional

HOLDEN
Emotional

ALYSSA
Well I fell in love hard with Caitlin
Bree when we were in high school

HOLDEN
Physical penetration

ALYSSA
We had sex

HOLDEN
Yeah but not real sex

ALYSSA
I move to have that remark stricken
from the record On account of it
makes you come off as completely naive
and infantile

HOLDEN
Well wheres the penetration in
lesbian sex

Alyssa holds up her hand

HOLDEN
A finger Come on Ive had my
finger in my ass but I wouldnt say
Ive had anal sex

ALYSSA
Did I hold up a finger
(waves her hand)

HOLDEN
(beat then he gets it)
Youre kidding
(she nods)

ALYSSA
Our bodies are built to pass a child
for Christs sake

HOLDEN
But doesnt it hurt

ALYSSA
Sure But in a good way And its
only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved
for really special occasions

HOLDEN
What about not-so-special occasions

ALYSSA
Tongue only

HOLDEN
But how can that be enough I mean
lets be real - how big can a tongue
even get
Alyssa swallows what shes chewing and releases her
tongue which is just huge Holden is transfixed
Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles standing

ALYSSA
Lets go

She exits Holden remains in the swing Alyssa comes
back in

ALYSSA
Come on
HOLDEN
Justuh just give me a moment

INT AIRPORT - DAY

Varietys the spice of life I likea
wide selection Sometimes Im in the
mood for nasty close-ups sometimes I
like them arty and air-brushed Some
times its a spread brown-eye kind of
night sometimes its girl-on-girl

time Sometimes a steamy letter will
do it sometimes - not often but
sometimes - I like the idea of a chick

with a horse

A beeping sound is heard Holden checks his beeper

HOLDEN

like a stud and straight-jacket her
back from the land of the lost And
the sad truth is that youll
accomplish none of that and wind up as
either an even more bitter misogynist
or a reverse fag-hag

Holdens at a loss Alyssa slips past the Woman
carrying an overnight bag

ALYSSA
Dont mind her Thats just her way a
saying hello

WOMAN
Actually its just my way of saying
Give it up

ALYSSA
(to Woman)
Youre such an asshole

WOMAN
When you file the date-rape charges
dont say I didnt warn you

HOLDEN
(holding out hand)
Im Holden by the way
WOMAN
Im the voice of reason that Miss
Bitch is having such a hard time
listening to

HOLDEN
Look were just friends

WOMAN
Thats what every guy says before he
tries purring your hand on his dick

HOLDEN
And how do you know men so well

WOMAN
Because I lapdance for a living dick-
head

She slams the door Holden looks to Alyssa

ALYSSA
Ohhh - you look so cute

She heads down the stairs

HOLDEN
Who was that

ALYSSA
Just an occasional friend

HOLDEN
Why would you want to hang our with
someone bitter as that

ALYSSA
(stops)
Remember this
(sticks out huge tongue)
Hers is even bigger than that

She smiles and continues on Holden looks back up at the

door He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his
fingers

EXT TURNPIKE - DAY

The car sits in traffic
INT CAR - DAY

Holden sighs

Alyssa plays with the radio

ALYSSA
You were raised Catholic right

HOLDEN
Yeah You

ALYSSA
Baptist

HOLDEN

Really Did you have a strict
upbringing

ALYSSA
Please There was no time to be bad -
we were too busy saying Jesus

HOLDEN
You think your upbringing had
something to do with your lifestyle
choice

ALYSSA

Somewhere along the line Its a
gradual transition to make - from
doing what the majority does to taking
a leap of faith and doing what feels
more natural Everything helps - from
the way you were handled as a kid to
the way the boys acted in third grade
to the shoes you wore at your freshman
prom

HOLDEN
Shoes

ALYSSA
Well they were really tight

HANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS

With the requisite music over which we hear a
conversation between Holden and Alyssa
1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating Holdens
talking The Waitress walks past and drops her pad She
bends over to pick it up hiking her mini-skirt up in
the process Alyssa stares at her ass Holden stops
talking and stares at her Alyssa looks over at him and
offers a caught smile

2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE
throwing various things into the basket Alyssa comes up
with a box of Tampons and throws them in Holden glances
at them a bit flushed Alyssa catches him picks up the
box and pulls one out She proceeds to demonstrate
their usage throwing one leg on the can and miming
insertion Holden puts up his hands in the I know I
know fashion

3) In the Studio Holden displays some of his artwork to
Alyssa during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes
to light it Its a child-proof lighter so shes having
trouble Holden grows a little frustrated Finally he
grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with
his teeth Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback
Holden spits the tab out and lights Alyssas smoke He
then continues with his display

4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE Steve-Dave
and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously Alyssa pays for a
comic Steve-Dave glowers at Holden He gives Alyssa
her change and they exit Steve-Dave goes back to his
card game with the Fan-Boy Suddenly a garbage can
comes crashing through their window Steve-Dave rips a
check off the garbage can and punches the counter The
Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly

5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT talking
She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder
Holden smiles to himself

HOLDEN VO
Let me ask you something - we get
along right

ALYSSA VO
Famously

HOLDEN VO
We have a definite chemistry

ALYSSA VO
So it would seem

HOLDEN VO
But were both into girls

ALYSSA VO
Im into women

HOLDEN VO
But you werent always gay

ALYSSA VO
When I was nine I had a crush on Scott
Baio

HOLDEN VO

So If wed met a long time ago say in
high school

ALYSSA VO
-Id still be muff-diving yes

HOLDEN VO
Thought so

INT STUDIO - DAY

Holden and Banky play EA Sports Hockey on Sega Theres
a knock at the door

HOLDEN
Come in

Alyssa enters and stands besides them smiling at their
game

ALYSSA
I read somewhere that guys who play
hockey are merely making up for penile
deficiencies by carrying big sticks

BANKY
I thought you lived in the city This
is like the umpteenth time Ive seen
you here Isnt that grounds enough
for the little pink mafia to throw you
out of their club

HOLDEN
(hits Banky to Alyssa)
Ill be ready in a second
I just have to school this mouthy
second-stringer
BANKY
Bitch youre schooling no one

They play Cut back and forth between the game and
Banky Holden and Alyssa

HOLDEN
(off game)
What Do something

BANKY
(off game)
You fucking cock-teaser Ill knock
your fucking teeth out and pass all
over your ass

HOLDEN
Look at how slow you are Christ you
move like a geriatric

BANKY
(screaming at screen)
Fuck You Fucking cock-sucker man
These faggots wont do what I tell
them to

HOLDEN
Oh Its the controller right Its
always the controller

BANKY
No its these fucking queers on
blades that cant accept a fucking
pass to save their lives What period
is this

HOLDEN
Final sixty of the third

BANKY
Fuck Look at your fucking guys
they FUCK
(whips controller)
FUCKING COCK SUCKER MAN I SWEAR TO
GoD

Banky storms away Alyssa looks at Holden
HOLDEN

Imagine if Id only beaten him by one
instead of thirty
INT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY

Holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine
Alyssa looks on

ALYSSA
Explain this again

HOLDEN
How could you have grown up down the
shore and never played skee-ball
What did you do with your youth

They head toward the skee-ball runs

ALYSSA
Stayed out late smoked pot screwed
around

HOLDEN

Not your grade school years your high
school years

ALYSSA
(off skee-ball run)
This looks complicated

HOLDEN

(Inserts coin and pulls

lever)
The premise is very basic - you roll
the ball up the ramp at varying
speeds in an effort to pop it into
the score circles The higher the
score the more prize tickets you get

ALYSSA
What do you do with the prize tickets

HOLDEN
Trade them in for prizes that arent
worth nearly as much as you paid to
play the game

ALYSSA
Then whats the point

HOLDEN
Its fun
ALYSSA
And you question my lifestyle

HOLDEN
Observe

Holden rolls the ball It pops into a twenty point
circle

HOLDEN
See Its just that simple

ALYSSA
Why not just walk up there and put it
in the fifty every time

HOLDEN
Wheres the skill in that

ALYSSA
Oh this is a skill Im sorry I had
no idea

HOLDEN

Just toss one

Alyssa picks up a ball squints to aim and whips it
overhand It pops off one of the circles and shoots back
at them missing them as they duck An OC knock and an
OW is heard Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs

HOLDEN
(to OC guy)
Im sorry man Shes new at this

Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head
He gets up

HOLDEN
(to OC)
Thank you
(hands Alyssa another ball)
Underhand Throw it underhand

ALYSSA
This is where you take straight chicks
on dates

HOLDEN
Its like Spanish Fly Thisll
probably be the first time I dont
score afterwards

ALYSSA
I dont know Im starting to get a
tingle in my bottom
(tosses a ball)
Ten

HOLDEN
(grabs a ball)
So whatd you do last night
(prepares to throw)

ALYSSA
Got laid

Holden whips the ball in surprise It ricochets off the
ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine
Alyssa laughs Holden looks around nervously

ALYSSA
Some more of that skill you were
telling me about

HOLDEN
Maybe we should just leave before
somebody gets hurt

ALYSSA
No way I want a cheap prize
(throws a ball)
So your friends quite the homophobe

HOLDEN
He just feels left out I think

ALYSSA

Im not talking about his infantile
hang-up with me Im talking about
when you two were playing that game
Everytime he swore - when his players
messed up he called them cocksuckers
he referred to the players as queers
he called you a cock-teaser

HOLDEN
I thought he was talking to you

ALYSSA
I know you think it means nothing and
it may in fact be unintentional but
its ugly all the same
HOLDEN
He was just pissed he was losing

ALYSSA
So he slams the gay community

HOLDEN
Cmon Dont get all pc on me

ALYSSA
Im not But what is that saying

HOLDEN
It says he gets too easily frustrated

ALYSSA
Its passiveagressive gay-bashing

HOLDEN
How do you figure

ALYSSA
How casually did it roll off his
tongue And thats how he expresses
his anger By calling people faggots

HOLDEN
I think youre reading too much into
it

ALYSSA

I think youre just so used to it that
it rolls off your back Ive heard
the two of you play your little rank
out game where one insists the other
is gay

(as the boys)
Youre a faggot No youre a
faggot Its cute and all to watch
you go at it like grade-schooler but
its also offensive - labeling and
ducking the label of being gay as if
it were the scarlet fucking letter

HOLDEN
Youre blowing this way out of
proportion We live in a more

tolerant age now You refer to
yourself as a dyke Hooper calls
himself a faggot all the time
ALYSSA
Yeah but thats whats known as
empowermentdisempowerment I call
myself a dyke so its not too
devastating when some throwback
screams it at me as Im leaving a bar
at night
Same for Hooper - by calling himself a
faggot he steals the thunder away
from the mouthy jerks of this world
whod like to beat him to it But the
difference between us having it and
your friend saying it is miles wide
We say it to mask the pain - you say
it for lack of a better expression at
any given moment No Holden we do
not live in a more tolerant age And
if you think thats the case then
youve been in the suburbs way too
long to be resuscitated

Holden kind of sulks Alyssa notices

ALYSSA
But you know what
(picks up his face)
I have more faith in you than that
(rips her tickets off)
Come on - I want my cheap prize

INT STUDIO - NIGHT

Holden enters Bankys still playing Sega Holden sits
next to him

HOLDEN
(off screen)
How bad do you suck

BANKY
How was your pseudo-date

HOLDEN
Leave it alone

BANKY
That chick bugs me

fq

HOLDEN
(rubs his head in baby-talk)
Aww Everyone bugs you

BANKY
Get off
(off game)
Fucking faggot Did you see that
Your dyke courting ass just got me
scored on

HOLDEN

(beat)
You know you should watch that If
youre going to get all bent out of
shape while playing the game so much
so that you need to curse the tv
try not to gay-bash it alright
Youre nor that kind of guy

(gets up)
And dont call her a dyke alright
Shes a lesbian

Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat
Banky sits there shocked He puts the controller down
and crosses to the drawing table

BANKY
What the fuck is going on here

HOLDEN
(pulling out pencil)
Im starting a new page

BANKY
(smacking pencil away)
Not with this shit With you What
the fuck is going on with you and that
girl

HOLDEN
Were friends

BANKY
Shes programming you

HOLDEN
I beg your pardon Programming

BANKY
Yeah And apparently you dont even
realize it What does it matter if I
refer to her as a dyke or if I call
the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the
privacy of my own office far from the
sensitive ears of the rest of the
world

HOLDEN
Its passiveaggressive gay-bashing
and I know youre not really
prejudiced at heart You should just
find some other way to express your
anger is all Im saying

Holden starts drawing Banky stares at him Then he
grabs the pencil out of Holdens hand and shoves him to
the side He starts drawing something

HOLDEN
What the fuck are you doing

BANKY
Bear with me here I just want to put
you through this little exercise
(drawing feverishly)
Okay now see this This is a four
way road okay

Banky draws a four-way stop He illustrates according to
his voice-over

BANKY VO
And dead in the center is a crisp
new hundred dollar bill Now at the
end of each of the streets are four
people okay You following Up
here we got a male-affectionate easy-
to-get-along-with no political agenda
lesbian Okay Now down here we
have a man-hating angry-as-fuck
agenda-of-rage bitter dyke To this
side we got Santa Claus right And
over to this side - the Easter Bunny

Banky finishes drawing Holdens shaking his head

BANKY
Which ones going to get to the
hundred dollar bill first

HOLDEN
What is this supposed to prove

BANKY
Im serious This is a serious
Holden storms

exercise Its like an SAT
question Which ones going to get to
the hundred dollar bill first - the
male-friendly lesbian the man-hating
dyke Santa Claus or the Easter
Bunny

HOLDEN
(beat then pissed)
The man-hating dyke

BANKY
Good Why

HOLDEN
I dont know

BANKY

(wildly crossing out the

other three)
BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE ARE FIGMENTS
OF YOUR FUCKING IMAGINATION

away Banky follows

HOLDEN
I dont need this Im going home

BANKY
Shes fucking with your mind man
She knows youve got this schoolboy
crush and shes using it to sway your
way of thinking

HOLDEN
And why would she need to do that
What is she Mata fucking Hari What
does she gain

BANKY
Maybe she thinks youll get her comic
picked up by Contender Or maybe she
thinks youll change the content of
our book to something more political
and message oriented Or gee - I
dont know - maybe because thats just
what dykes like to do fuck around
with straight guys heads just so she
can go back to her little rug-muncher
club and have a good laugh with all
her man-hating harpy cronies about how
fucking stupid and easily duped men
are

HOLDEN
Youre so out of line right now

BANKY
You dont even know this girl Big
deal shes from Middletown and she
went to North All the girls at North
were bitches and sluts anyway And
this ones got them beat by a mile
because shes a bitchslutdyke

HOLDEN
Watch your fucking mouth is all Im
going to tell you

BANKY
Oh why Do you get my back when she
bashes me Because I know she does
And do you know why she does Because
I wont play her fucking game

HOLDEN
Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious
bullshit is amusing Sometimes its
just fucking annoying as piss

BANKY
What is it about this girl You know
you have no shot at getting her into
bed Why do you bother wasting time
with her Because youre Holden
fucking McNeil - most persistent
traveller on the road thats not the
path of least resistance
Everythings gotta be a fucking
challenge for you and this little
relationship with that bitch is a
prime example of your fucking
condition Well I dont needa
fucking magic eight ball to look into
your future you want a forecast
Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa
(shakes and looks at
imaginary ball)
What a shock - Not fucking likely
This relationship of yours is
affecting you our work and our
friendship and the times going to
come when I throw down the gauntlet
and say its me or her And then

whatre you going to say

HOLDEN
(beat)
I think you should let this one go

BANKY
No what would you say Would you
trash twenty years of friendship
because youve got some idiotic notion
that this chick would even let you
sniff her panties let alone fuck
her

HOLDEN
Let it go

BANKY
What the fuck WHAT THE FUCK MAKES
THIS BITCH ALL THAT IMPORTANT
Holden looks at Banky for a long beat

HOLDEN
Im in love with her man

Banky stares at him Holden stares back Banky looks
into Holdens eyes Suddenly he softens a bit He
drops his head

BANKY
Fuck

Banky walks away Holden watches him go and exits

INT DINER - NIGHT

Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth Alyssa picks through
her food Holden looks at the check and pulls money from
his wallet

HOLDEN
I wish you were the one being pursued
by M-TV

ALYSSA
Oh really

HOLDEN

Sure Then you could sell our and
maybe pick up the check once in
awhile

ALYSSA
(drops her fork and wipes her
hands)
Were leaving
HOLDEN
Well its not like this is a bed and
breakfast
ALYSSA

Ive got a little business to conduct

She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth Holden
watches her then follows

A23 Alyssa slides up to the cashiers desk as does
Holden who offers a puzzled shrug Alyssa offers the
just wait finger The CASHIER turns to her

ALYSSA
Are you an authorized deal-maker in
this establishment Do you have the
power to negotiate

CASHIER
You wanna haggle over the price of
your French Dip

ALYSSA
I want to haggle over the price of
fine art

CASHIER
What do you mean

ALYSSA
(pointing OC)
There By the kitchen That
painting

CASHIER
What about it

ALYSSA
The price tag says seventy five

CASHIER
So

HOLDEN

NIGHT

INT CAR -

(to Alyssa)
Tell me youre kidding

ALYSSA
Ill give you fifty

CASHIER

(to OC)
Manuel Bring me the Dyksiezski off
the wall

(to Alyssa)
All my years in the diner business
Ive waited for this day - the day
when someone wanted to buy one of the
pictures

ALYSSA
(holds out hand)
Alyssa Jones Pleased to meet you
CASHIER

You say you want to haggle but you
dont know rule one about haggling
which you just broke you never give
your name The name is power and to
give the opponent that piece of you is
to give away victory

ALYSSA
Im only trying to conduct a
transaction Were not opponents

CASHIER
(accepting painting from
BUSBOY)
Oh but we are - if you think Im
letting this beautiful piece go for
fifty

ALYSSA
Ah-ha
(to Holden)
Now were haggling

Its drizzling outside Holden drives Alyssa hugs her
painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield

making footprints
Holden stares

HOLDEN
Ive always wondered what kind of
people buy those things I cant
believe you talked him down to twenty
five

ALYSSA
It was looking shakey when he told me
the artist was a blind cripple witha
hump-back but I held my ground
Theres no room for sympathy in the
buyers market

HOLDEN
Where are you going to hang it

ALYSSA
Im not You are

HOLDEN
You want me to hang it for you You
better hope it doesnt get out to the
girl-nation that you needed a man to
help you hang a picture

ALYSSA
Youre going to hang it in your house
I bought it for you

HOLDEN
(laughs)
Yeah right

ALYSSA
(looks at him)
Im serious

at her

HOLDEN
Why

ALYSSA
Because its captured the moment
Itll be a constant reminder - not
just of tonight but of our
introduction the building of our
friendship everything Make no
mistake about it my Friend - its a
gift to you from me so youll always
remember us
Holden stares ahead

right

EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

The car pulls to the side of the road
heavier now

INT CAR

- NIGHT

Holden throws the car into park

ALYSSA
Why are we stopping

HOLDEN
Because I cant take it

ALYSSA
Cant take what

HOLDEN
I love you
ALYSSA
(beat)
You love me
HOLDEN

I love you And not ina friendly
way although I think were great
friends And not in a misplaced
affection puppy-dog way although Im
sure thats what youll call it And
its not because youre unattainable
I love you Very simple very truly
Youre the epitome of every attribute
and quality Ive ever looked for in
another person I know you think of
me as just a friend and crossing that
line is the furthest thing from an
option youd ever consider But I
cant do this any longer I cant
stand next to you without wanting to
hold you I cant look into your eyes
without feeling that longing you only
read about in trashy romance novels

Then he swerves the wheel to the

The rain is a bit
I cant talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you
are I know this will probably queer
our friendship - no pun intended - but
I had to say it because Ive never
felt this before and I like who I am
because of it And if bringing it to
light means we cant hang out anymore
then that hurts me But I couldnt
allow another day to go by without
getting it out there regardless of
the outcome which by the look on your
face is to be the inevitable shoot-
down And Ill accept that But I know
some part of you is hesitating for a
moment and if there is a moment of
hesitation that means you feel
something too All I ask is that you
not suppress that - at least for ten
minutes - and try to dwell in it
before you dismiss it

There isnt another soul on this
fucking planet whos ever made me the
person I am when Im with you and I
would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau
Because its there between you and me
You cant deny that And even if we
never speak again after tonight
please know that Im forever changed
because of you and what youve meant
to me which - while I do appreciate
it - Id never need a painting of
birds bought at a diner to remind me
of

Holden stares at Alyssa She stares back Then she gets
out of the car

HOLDEN
Was it something I said

EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

Holden gets out of the car Its raining pretty hard
now Alyssas hitching up the road Holden reaches her

HOLDEN
What are you doing
ALYSSA
Get back in the car and get out of
here

HOLDEN
Youre going to hitch to New York

ALYSSA
Yep

HOLDEN
Arent you at least going to comment

ALYSSA
Heres my comment fuck you

HOLDEN
Why

ALYSSA
That was so unfair You know how
unfair that was

HOLDEN
Its unfair that Im in love with you

ALYSSA
No its unfortunate that youre in
love with me Its unfair that you
felt the fucking need to unburden your
soul about it Do you remember for a
fucking second who I am

HOLDEN
So People change

ALYSSA
Oh its that simple You fall in
love with me and want a romantic
relationship nothing changes for you
with the exception of feeling hunky-
dorey all the time But what about-
me Its not that simple is it I
cant just get into a relationship
with you without throwing my whole
fucking world into upheaval

HOLDEN
But thats every relationship
Theres always going to be a period of
adjustment
ALYSSA

Period of adjustment

(hitting him)
THERES NO PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT
HOLDEN IM FUCKING GAY THATS WHO
I AM AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT
AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOUVE GOT A
CRUSH

HOLDEN
If this is a crush then I dont
know if I could take the real thing if
it ever happens

She looks at him rain drenching the pair She shakes
her head ruefully

ALYSSA
Go home Holden

She walks away Holden stands there at a loss Then he
turns and heads back to his car

As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her
Alyssa pounces on him grabs his face and locks lips with
him big time He drops his keys and embraces her

And there they stand by the side of the road drenched
kissing

EXT STUDIO - DAY

Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys
with the other He jams them into the lock opening the
door He picks up the mail on the floor

INT STUDIO - DAY

He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the
kitchenette passing by the blanket-covered slumbering
forms of Holden and Alyssa who are out cold in each
others arms The place looks a mess - Like a couple of
people were engaged in some tremendous fucking Banky is
oblivious He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls
out a chocolate milk He opens it sticks a straw into
the top and begins sipping and sifting through the mail
He comes to mail thats Holdens and tosses it onto the
couch near Holdens head He looks down at the sleeping
couple then back at the mail for a couple of beats

Then he freezes He looks down again and drops his jaw
and his carton of choco It hits the floor with a pop
Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up eyes struggling to
focus They look at one another then at the
flabbergasted Banky Banky blinks Then he shuffles
toward the door again and lets himself out

ALYSSA
(off Holdens reaction)
I take it thats not good

HOLDEN
(getting up)
Stay here
(he kisses her and exits)

EXT STREET - DAY

Banky sits on a curb staring into the distance Holden
saunters up and sits beside him He follows Bankys
gaze

BANKY
Catholic school girls

Across the street the Catholic High School is letting
out Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters
smoke frolic wait for their bus

BANKY
The uniform is what does it for me I
wish Id have went with more Catholic
school girls when I was a kid As it
stands I have no and then she
unzipped her jumper stories

HOLDEN
You looked weirded out back there

BANKY
Thats my couch you were fucking on

HOLDEN
Sorry

BANKY
I wanted to watch some TV Hard to do
when your best friends wrapped around
a naked rug-muncher on your couch
HOLDEN
She had boxers on

Banky shoots him a glare He goes back to staring at the
oc girls

BANKY
This is all going to end badly

HOLDEN
You dont know that

BANKY
I know you Youre way too
conservative for that girl Shes
been around and seen things weve only
read about in books

HOLDEN
But we have read about them So were
prepared

BANKY

Theres no we here Youre going to
have to go through this alone And
its one thing to read about shit and
something different when youre forced
to deal with it on a regular basis
When you guys are walking in the mall
and both your heads turn at a really
nice looking chick its going to eat
you up inside Youll spend most of
your time wondering when the other
shoes going to drop Because for
you this isnt about cool weird sex
stuff its about love

HOLDEN
Maybe it is for her as well

BANKY
Somehow I doubt it

HOLDEN
Everyones not out to get someone in
life Bank

BANKY
Everybody has an agenda Everyone

HOLDEN
Yourself
BANKY
My agenda is to watch your back

HOLDEN
To what end

BANKY
To insure that all this time weve
spent together building something
wasnt wasted

HOLDEN
Shes not going to ruin the comic

BANKY
I wasnt talking about the comic
(gets up)
Im going to gel a bagel Clean off
my fucking couch so I can watch TV

Banky walks away Holden shakes his head

TORY

Another one bites the dust

INT HOLDENS BEDROOM -NIGHT

Holden and Alyssa lie in each others arms moonlight
bathing them She smokes

HOLDEN
Can I ask you something

ALYSSA
Dont even tell me you want to do it
again

HOLDEN

Why me - you know Why now

ALYSSA
Because you were giving me that look
and I got wet

HOLDEN
You know what Im talking about

ALYSSA
Why not You

HOLDEN
ma guy Youre attracted to girls

ALYSSA
see youve been taking notes
Historically yes thats true

HOLDEN
Then why this

ALYSSA

ve given that a lot of thought you
now I mean now that Im being
ostracized by my friends Ive had a
lot of time to think about all of
this And what Ive come up with is
really simple I came to this on my
terms I didnt just heed what I was
taught you know Men and women

should be together its the natural
way - that kind of thing Im not
with you because of what family
society life tried to instill in me
from day one The way the world is -
how seldom you meet that one person
who gets you its so rare My
parents didnt really have it There
was no example set for me in the world
of malefemale relation ships And to
cut oneself off from finding that
person - to immediately half your

options by eliminating the possibility
of finding that one person within your
own gender that just seemed stupid
So I didnt And by leaving my
options open I was branded gay
which to me was no big deal - labels
are labels you know They define
what you do not who you are I guess
But then you come along You -
the one least likely I mean you were
a guy

HOLDEN
Still am

ALYSSA

And while I was falling for you I put
a ceiling on that because you were a
guy

Until I remembered why I opened the
door to women in the first place - to
not limit the likelihood of finding
that one person whod compliment me so
completely And so here we are I was
thorough when I looked for you and I
feel justified lying in your arms -
because I got here on my terms and
have no question that there was
someplace I didnt look And that
makes all the difference

HOLDEN
(beat)
Shit
ALYSSA
What
HOLDEN

Well you took the luster our of it
She snuggles into him and closes her eyes

ALYSSA
What luster

HOLDEN
(joking - in case you didnt
get it)
Of how I brought you back from the
other side How all you needed was
the right man to turn you around

ALYSSA
Youre not the right man
(kisses him)
Youre just the one

Holden stares

at the ceiling

HOLDEN
Can I at least cell people that all
you needed was some serious deep-
dicking

She hits him with her pillow

FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS

In Holdens Apartment - Alyssa waves in various

shaking her head accordingly Then she puts
Cut to Holden hanging the

lyssa gave him

a severely crooked angle
es his head no

He looks back to

Banky
Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL
pointing at things
She presses the reset button over and
look

ll

s her tongue at him

At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon

An old WOMAN stares at her

lf He goes to show if to Alyssa whos
back of Anything But Dick an allchick
Holden nods to the

old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssas hands

putting it back on the shelf

He ushers her away The

old Woman waits until theyre gone and then picks up the
tape herself
4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the
park her crotch against the back of his neck Hes
talking She taps him and he stops and looks up She
begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face
He pulls her off and put her down Shes laughing Hes
flushed with embarrassment The same Old Woman from the
Video store passes by with her husband Holden shrugs

5) In Holdens Apartment again - Alyssa again with the

waving then putting up her hands to stop Cut to Holden
again this time with the painting hung completely upside
down He looks at it then offers her a bewildered gaze

6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table There
are penciled pages on it with a note that says Hanging
out with Alyssa today Holden Banky crumples it up
and throws it across the room

7) In Holdens Apartment - Alyssa waves this way then
that way then puts up her hands frantically to stop
She settles back against the wall a satisfied smile
crawling across her face and closes her eyes We pull
back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her
eating her out (no we dont see anything)

INT OFFICE - DAY

Holden draws A book is thrown in front of him He
looks up Banky stands there

BANKY
Check out page forty eight

Holden looks down at that book Its the Nineteen Eighty
Eight yearbook from Middletown North He shakes his head
at Banky and flips it open

On the page is Alyssas Senior year photo Under her
name is another name in quotes that says Finger Cuffs

HOLDEN
(looking up)
So

BANKY
Did you see the nickname

HOLDEN
Finger Cuffs
BANKY
And

HOLDEN
And she had a weird nick-name
Whats your point

BANKY
Do you know why its Finger Cuffs

HOLDEN
I suppose you do

BANKY
I do
(takes a seat)
You remember Cohee Lundin Left
Hudson and went to North our senior
year

HOLDEN
Yeah

BANKY
Well I ran into him at Food City the
other day and we got to talking and
I mentioned that you were dating
Alyssa and he said

CUT TO COHEE LUNDON In the PARKING LOT of FOOD CITY
addressing the camera

COHEE
Alyssa Jones Shit I know Alyssa
Jones I mean I know Alyssa Jones

you know what Im saying

Me and Rick Derris used to hang our
with her for awhile right Just
hanging around her house after school
cuz her parents were like never home
and shit And one day Rick just
whips it out and starts rubbing it on
her leg and shit chasing her around
the living room - I was dying But
you know what the crazy bitch did

She fucking drops to her knees and
just starts sucking him off right in
front of me Like I wasnt even there
man I almost died But thats not
the fucked up part - the fucked up
part was Rick man - right in the
middle of it he turns to me and hes
pointing at her and he says Cohee
Just like that - Cohee So Im like
Ill give it a shot And I start
pulling her pants down all slow cuz
I figure any second shes gonna turn
around and belt me in the mouth
right But yo check this shit out -
shes all into it man She dont try
to stop me or nothing Shes

all wet and shit and I just went to
work know what Im saying Me and
Rick are going to town on this crazy
bitch and shes just loving it all
moaning and shit It was fucked up
So Ricks the one that came up with
the nickname - cuz that day she had
us locked in tight from both sides -
like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger
cuffs

BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky

HOLDEN
Hes full of shit

BANKY
Cohees a lot of things but an
exxagerator hes not The dudes
Catholic

HOLDEN
Shes never even been with a guy

BANKY

hats what she says But I say her
n her hands and knees getting filled
ut like an application constitutes
being with a guy

-008H

HOLDEN

Hes pulling your chain And the fact
that you even bought it for a second
makes you look like an idiot

BANKY
Im getting your back asshole
People dont forget shit like Finger
Cuffs And if it got out that shes
queer as well how do you think its
going to make you look
HOLDEN
I give a shit what people think

BANKY
Alright forget about that what if
shes carrying a disease That was
just one story - what if theres more

HOLDEN
(grabs his coat)
Youre such a fucking asshole

BANKY
What Oh its not possible that
shes all crudded up Cohee I can
vouch for as clean - the dude never
got laid in high school But Derris
is an arch fucking bush-man Name me
one chick in our senior class that
Rick Derris didnt nail for Christs

sake

HOLDEN
Would you let this go Im telling
you -— shes never even been with a

guy let alone those two zeroes

BANKY
And Im telling you the bitch could
be a bigger fucking germ farm than
that monkey in Outbreak

Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall

HOLDEN
Give it a rest Do you hear me Im
tired of this shit Shes my goddamn
girlfriend do you understand Show
her a little fucking respect
And if you ever even so much as
mention that Alyssa looks a little
peaked from now on Ill put your
fucking teeth down your throat

He releases Banky Banky brushes himself off

BANKY
Maybe Ill put your fucking teeth down
your throat

HOLDEN
(walking out)
Not bloody Likely
Banky runs to the open door

BANKY
(calling after him)
Ive been working out you know
(no response)
You better be ready to make that M-TV
deal

The downstairs door slams Banky makes a muscle then
feels it

INT TOWER RECORDS - DAY

Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs

HOOPER
Wheres that bitch partner of yours
been

HOLDEN

Sulking Hes having a real problem
with this Alyssa thing

HOOPER

I think its more like Bankys having
a problem with all things not hetero
right about now And Im just another
paradigm of said aberration

HOLDEN
Banky does not hate gays you know
that

HOOPER

But I do think he is a bit homophobic
And this latest episode between you
and Ms Thing has tapped into that

In his warped perception he lost you
to the dark side - which is she

HOLDEN
You make it sound like me and him were
dating

HOOPER

Dont kid yourself - that boy loves
you in a way that hes not ready to
deal with

HOLDEN
(beat)
Hes been digging up dirt on Alyssa

HOOPER
And just what has Mister Angela
Lansbury uncovered about your lady
fair

HOLDEN
He heard some bullshit story that she
took on two guys

HOOPER

Really Well then hes barking up the
wrong we if he wants to split you up
isnt he Hes not going to make you
see the error of your ways by pointing
out how truly gay shes not

(holds up a disc)
This one

HOLDEN
Have it
(beat)
Actually its kind of gotten to me

HOOPER
How so

HOLDEN
Bankys not known for believing
misinformation Hes got a pretty
good bullshit detector

HOOPER
So what if it is true Would that
bother you

HOLDEN
Sex with multiple partners

Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek

HOLDEN
At the same time

Again even louder hands slapped against his cheeks

HOLDEN
Thanks for being so comforting

HOOPER
So what do you care

HOLDEN
Well thats the thing isnt it I
shouldnt but it gets to me

HOOPER
Kind of gal Alyssa is you dont think
shes been in the middle of an all -
girl group-grope

HOLDEN
You see - that doesnt bother me But
the thought of her and guys Uh
HOOPER

Oh Holden I beg you - please dont
drop fifty stories in my opinion of
you by falling prey to that latest of
trendy beasts

HOLDEN
Which is

HOOPER
Lesbian chic Its oh-so acceptable
to be a gay girl nowadays People
think its cute because theyve got
this fool picture in their heads about
lipstick lesbians - like they all
resemble Alyssa - while most of them
look more like you

HOLDEN
Do I detect a little inter-subculture
cattiness

HOOPER
Gay or straight - uglys still ugly
And most of those boys are scary

HOLDEN
I thought fags were all supposed to be
super-supportive of one another

HOOPER
Screw that all for one shit I
gotta deal with being the minority in
the minority of the minority and
A young BLACK
book

nobodys supporting my ass While the
whole of society is fawning over girls-
on-girls here I sit - a reviled gay
man and to top that off Ima gay
black man - notoriously the most

swishy of the bunch

HOLDEN
Three strikes

HOOPER
Hey hey Theres a line

KID approaches Hooper holding a comic

KID
Are you Hooper X

HOOPER
(in militant mode)
A-salaam Alaikum little brother

KID
Could you sign my comic

HOOPER

(signing comic nods to

Holden)
See that guy there Hes the devil
you understand Never take your eye
off the Man Our people took their
eyes off him one time and he had us
in chains in two shakes of his snakes
tail

The Kid offers Holden an angry look Hooper gives him
back his comic

HOOPER
Fight the power little G

KID
Word is bond

The Kid leaves Hooper slips back into his real voice

HOOPER
Look at what I have to resort to for
professional respect What is it
about gay men that terrifies the rest
of the world
(shakes his head)
As for this hang-up with Alyssas
past maybe whats really bothering
you is that your fragile fantasy might
not be true

HOLDEN
What do you mean

HOOPER
Holden - dont even try to come off
like you dont know what Im saying
Men need to believe that theyre Marco
fucking Polo when it comes to sex -
like theyre the only ones whove ever
explored new territory And its hard
not to let them believe it I let my
boys run with it for awhile - feed
them some of that Ive never done
this before bullshit and let em
labor under the delusion that they
rockin my world until I cant stand
them anymore Then I hit em with the
truth Its a sick game The world
would be a better place if people
would just accept that theres nothing
new under the sun and everything you
can do with a person has probably been
done long before you got there

HOLDEN
I can accept that

HOOPER

Honey that almost sounded convincing
Do yourself a favor - just ask her
about her past point blank Get it
out of the way before it gets too big
for both yall to move

(spotting something OC)
Oooh Myra Breckinridge

Hooper trots off Holden glances at the disc in his

hands Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks

barely

clad making out The title is Men Suck and so do
Girls - All XXX Action

INT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT

On the ice

two teams clash chasing the puck up and
back checking galore

In the bleachers amidst a slew of fans Alyssa watches
the game with a large degree of enjoyment Sitting
beside her Holden doesnt seem to share her enthusiasm

ALYSSA
Since most of these people are rooting
for the home team Im going to cheer
for the visitors Im a big visitors
fan - especially the kind that make
coffee for you in the morning before

they go
(smiles at Holden no
response)
That was a joke A little wacky
wordplay
HOLDEN
What do you mean visitors
ALYSSA
Was I being too obscure The kind
that - until recently - had no dicks

and would spend the night

HOLDEN
So that was until recently

ALYSSA
Oh yeah
(shouting to ice)
Hey - foul Foul He was traveling
or something

HOLDEN
So nobody bur me has stayed the night
at your place since we got together

ALYSSA
(beat)
Something on your mind Holden

HOLDEN
No I was just wondering

ALYSSA
If Ive been faithful or something

HOLDEN

ON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS
One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off
The other Player gives chase

Alyssas very into the game Holden shakes his head

HOLDEN
Thatd make Banky half right

ALYSSA
About what

HOLDEN
He said all the girls from North were
bitches and sluts

ALYSSA

Really Im sorry - you two left high
school behind how many years ago

his cheek)

HOLDEN
(under his breath)

ALYSSA

Whered you see a North yearbook

HOLDEN
Do you know Rick Derris

ICE - The Players skid into the corner where
One checks Player Two into the boards hard
Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his

The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild

ALYSSA
Rick Sure We used to hang out in
high school
(to ice)
PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK NUMBER

HOLDEN

HOLDEN

ALYSSA

HOLDEN
Cohee

ALYSSA
Yeah Cohee Lundin God I havent
thought about that name in years

ON THE ICE - The Players square off Player Two pulls
Player Ones helmet off and punches him in the face

Holden looks as if hed Like to do the same to his
companion Alyssas into the game

ALYSSA
I remember those guysd come over
almost everyday after school Theyd
bug my sisters look for porno tapes
in my dads closet raid our fridge
They really took advantage of my
parents never being home

ON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player Ones jersey and
gut punches him Alyssa seems oblivious to Holdens
anger so enthralled with the action is she

ALYSSA
(starts laughing)
This one day Rick pulled out his

dick and chased me around the house
with it Right in front of Cohee I
couldnt believe it Guys are weird -
I thought the whole size hang-up made
you all terrified to show your dicks
to each other

ON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit then quickly
rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two landing a
barrage of his own punches Blood sprays across the ice

Holdens face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking Alyssas
still in the game

HOLDEN
Rick pulled his dick out Really
Whatd you do

ALYSSA
(looks him dead in the eye)
I blew him while Cohee fucked me
ON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot slamming
his fist into Player Twos nose The blood shoots out
like a geyser and Two goes down hard

Holden stares at Alyssa flabbergasted The crowd around
them stares not at the fight on the ice but the fight in
their midst shocked Alyssa fumes

HOLDEN
Excuse me

ALYSSA

Thats what you wanted to hear isnt
it Isnt that what this little cross-
examination of yours is about Well
try not to be so obvious about it next
time there are subtler ways of
badgering a witness

(to Bystander)
Am I right

BYSTANDER
(to Holden)
Jeez even I knew what you were
getting at
ALYSSA

(gathering her stuff)
If you wanted some background
information on me all you had to do
was ask - Id have gladly volunteered
it You didnt have to play Hercules
fucking Poirot

She storms away Holden chases after her The Bystander
watches them go

BYSTANDER
(to companion)
I told you these were good seats

INT RINK LOBBY EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Alyssa marches quickly pulling on her coat Holden
catches up to her We track with them our into the
parking lot

HOLDEN
So its true
ALYSSA
Yes Holden In fact everything you
heard or dug up on me was probably
true Yeah I took on two guys at
once You want to hear some gems you
might not have unearthed - I took a
twenty six year old guy to my senior
prom and then left halfway through to
have sex with him and Gwen Turner in
the back of a limo And the girl who
got caught in the shower with Miss
Moffit the gym teacher That was me
Or how about in college when I let
Shannon Hamilton videotape us having
sex - only to find out the next day
that he broadcast it on the campus
cable station Theyre all true -
those and so many more Didnt you
know Im the queen of urban legend

HOLDEN
How the hell could you do those
things

ALYSSA
Easily Some of it I did out of
stupidity some of it I did out of
what I thought was love but - good or
bad - they were my choices and Im
not making apologies for them now -
not to you or anyone And how dare
you try to lay a guilt trip on me
about it - in public no less Who
the fuck do you think you are you
judgemental prick

HOLDEN
How am I supposed to feel about all of
this

ALYSSA
How are you supposed to feel about it
Feel what ever the fuck you want about
it The only thing that really
matters is how you feel about me

HOLDEN
I dont know how I feel about you now

ALYSSA
Why Because I had some sex
HOLDEN
Some sex

ALYSSA
Yes Holden - thats all it was some
sex Most of it stupid high school
sex for Christs sake Like you
never had sex in high school

HOLDEN
Theres a world of fucking difference
between typical high school sex and
two guys at once They fucking used
you

ALYSSA

I used them You dont think I
wouldve let it happen if I hadnt
wanted it to do you I was an
experimental girl for Christs sake
Maybe you knew early on that your
track was from point a to b - but
unlike you I wasnt given a fucking
map at birth so I tried it all That
is until we - thats you and I - got
together and suddenly I was sated
Cant you take some fucking comfort in
that You turned out to be all I was
ever looking for - the missing piece
in the big fucking puzzle

(tries to calm down)
Look Im sorry I let you believe that
you were the only guy Id ever been
with I shouldve been more honest
But it seemed to make you feel special
in a way that me telling you over and
over again how incredible you are
would never get across

She touches his face He pulls back She stares at him
hurt and pissed

ALYSSA
Do you mean to tell me that - while
you have zero problem with me sleeping
with half the women in New York City -
you have some sort of half-assed
mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent
antics that took place almost ten
years ago What the fuck is your
problem
Holdens eyes are downcast Alyssa waits for a response

HOLDEN
I want us to be something that we
cant

ALYSSA

And whats that

HOLDEN
(beat)
A normal couple

Holden skulks off Alyssa stares after him and then
starts kicking and punching a car beside her finally
slumping to the ground She cries

INT STUDIO - DUSK

Holden sits on the couch alone in the dark The door
opens and Banky enters He stands there sizing up
Holdens mood

BANKY

Holden nods Banky nods back He stands there for a
beat Then he sits beside Holden He opens his arms
Holden shifts into his friends embrace and begins crying
on his shoulder Banky pats his back Pull back on a
man in pain and the comfort of a friend

something Why dont I remember this

BOB
What you dont know about me I can
just about squeeze into the Grand
fucking Canyon Did you know I always
wanted to be a dancer in Vegas

Jay and Holden look at him Silent Bob busts a move with
his hands

BOB
Hunhh Bet you didnt know that

JAY
Just cell your fucking story so we can
get out of here and smoke this

BOB
(to Holden)
So theres me an Amy and were all
inseparable right Just big time in
love And then about four months in
I ask about the ex-boyfriend Dumb
move I know but you know how it is -
you dont really want to know but you
just have to stupid guy bullshit
Anyway she starts telling me all about
him - how they dated for years lived
together her mother likes me better
blah blah blah - and Im okay But
then she tells me that a couple times
he brought other people to bed with
them - menage a tois I believe its
called Now this just blows my mind
I mean Im not used to that sort of
thing right I was raised Catholic

JAY
Saint Shithead

Silent Bob backhands him Jay raises his fist as if to
strike

BOB
Do something
(to Holden)
So I get weirded out and just start
blasting her right This is the only
way I can deal with it - by calling
her a slut and telling her that she
was used - I mean Im out for blood I
want to hurt her - because I dont
know how to deal with what Im
feeling And Im like What the fuck
is wrong with you and shes telling
me that it was that time in that
place and she didnt do anything
wrong so shes not gonna apologize
So I tell her its over and I walk

JAY
Fucking a

BOB
No idiot It was a mistake I
wasnt disgusted with her I was
afraid At that moment I felt small -
like Id lacked experience like Id
never be on her level or never be
enough for her or something
And what I didnt get was that she
didnt care She wasnt looking for
that guy anymore She was looking for
me But by the time I realized this
it was too late you know Shed
moved on and all I had to show for it
was some foolish pride which then
gave way to regret She was the girl
I know that now But I pushed her
away

Everyones silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette

BOB
So Ive spent every day since then
chasing Amy
(takes a drag from his smoke)
So to speak

They sit there for a beat Jay pockets the rest of his
dime-bag

Jedi-bitch

Exit Jay and Silent Bob Holden remains in the booth
thinking

MONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE

1) Holden sits at his drawing table tapping his pencil
up and down

2)Alyssa sits in a club getting talked at by some women
Shes not present in the conversation

3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes
the contracts at him and Banky makes the I know I
know face

4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him

5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone She hangs up
angrily

6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked
through Hes staring at Alyssas yearbook picture He
closes the book and sighs Then an idea hits him He
jumps up and dashes out of the park

INT STUDIO - NIGHT

Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch Holden paces in front
of them

HOLDEN
I know youre wondering why I asked
you both here tonight at the same
time knowing that we have shit to
settle between us separately

BANKY
I just figured you wanted to kill two
birds with one stone by telling her to
fuck off with me here so you didnt
have to go through the story again
later on

ALYSSA
Fuck you

BANKY
Not even if you let me videotape it

HOLDEN

Enough

(they both look at him)
Ive been going through things over
and over And I dissected it all and
looked at it a thousand different
ways Banky - theres friction
between us for the first time in our
lives You hate me dating Alyssa and
you want me to sign off on this M-TV
thing

BANKY
How perceptive

HOLDEN
Alyssa - you and I hit a wall because
I dont know how to deal with your
past I guess

BANKY

Thats a nice way of putting it Id
have said the whole double-stuff
thing

HOLDEN

(right in his face)
Im only going to say it once shut
up

(back to pacing)
Now - I know Im to blame one way or
the other on both accounts With you
Alyssa - its my fault because I feel
inadequate Because youve had so
much experience had such a big life
and my lifes been pretty small in
comparison

ALYSSA
That doesnt matter to me

HOLDEN

Please I have to get through this

(beat)
And with you Banky - I know why youre
having such a hard time with Alyssa
and its something thats been obvious
forever but I guess I just didnt
acknowledge it

(takes a deep breath)
Youre in love with me

BANKY
(makes a face beat)
What

HOLDEN
Youre attracted to me Just as ina
way Im attracted to you I mean it
makes sense - weve been together so
long we have so much in common

BANKY
(getting up)
Well Ive got to get home and catch
the last few minutes of Babylon 5
so Ill be

Holden grabs him kisses him full on the lips and pushes

him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts
and speechless - looks away

HOLDEN

Banky - wide-eyed

Its something youre going to have to
deal with Bank You may very well
be gay which explains your homophobia
and why youre so jealous of Alyssa
and your sense of humor as well

BANKY
Just cause a guys got a predilection
coward dick jokes

HOLDEN
Bank Stop Deal with it Youll
feel much better

He grabs a chair from the side of the room

HOLDEN
Now - at this point you may be asking
yourself the question that Ive been
going over and over in my head for the
last few days what does one have to
do with the other

Alyssas face drops She subtly shakes her head

ALYSSA
(under her breath)

Dont

HOLDEN
And when I did some serious soul-
searching it came at me from out of
nowhere and suddenly it all made
sense - a calm came over me I know
what we have to do And then you -
Bank you Alyssa and I - all of us
can finally be alright

ALYSSA
(again under her breath)
Please dont say it

HOLDEN
(sits in the chair takes a
long beat)

Weve all got to have sex together

The room is silent Holden Lights a cigarette Bankys
eyes nearly bug Alyssas head drops

HOLDEN
Dont you see That would take care
of everything Alyssa - I wouldnt
feel inadequate or too conservative
anymore Ill have done something on
par with all the experience youve
had And itll be with you whichll
make it that much more powerful And
Banky - you can cake that leap that
everyone else but you sees that you
should take And itll be okay
because itll be with me - your best
friend for years Weve been
everything to each other but
intimates And now well have been
through that together too And it
wont have to be a total leap for you
because a woman will be involved And
when its over all that aggression
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone
Because youll have shared in
something beautiful with the woman I
love Itll be cathartic A true
communion We have to do this For

me for both of you for all of our
sakes This will keep us together
(beat)

What do you say

Banky stares forward wide-eyed He leans back into the
couch and lets out a huge sigh Then shrugs

BANKY
Sure

Holden smiles at his friend Then he looks at Alyssa

HOLDEN
You know I need this You know itll
help
Alyssa looks at him sadly
ALYSSA

No

Holden reacts shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief

HOLDEN
No I I thought youd be into
this

ALYSSA

You did What does that say about me
HOLDEN

But youve youve done stuff
like this This should be no big deal
for you

ALYSSA

You dont want this
(lights her cigarette)
You really dont want this Trust me

HOLDEN
I need this This has to happen Why
cant you see that And how can you
not What does that say about me
You can take it from two guys whose
names you can barely remember but I
ask you to share an experience like it
- where its about intimacy - and you
say no

ALYSSA
(inhales from her cigarette
takes a beat)
I cant

Holden moves to her side of the couch

HOLDEN
You can Ill be there And when
its over well be the strongest
weve ever been because we got through
some nasty shit together And well
finally be on the same level together
And then therell be nothing we cant
accomplish

A tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him sadly and
touches his face

ALYSSA

Oh Holden

(trying to compose herself)
That time is over for me Ive been
there Ive done it And I didnt
find what I was looking for in any of
it I found that in you - in us
Doing this wont help you forget about
the things youre hung up on Itll
create more

points to it and gives a thumbs up

Banky looks in another direction OC He looks at Holden
and points to it Holden looks in the same direction
and then looks back at Banky and nods

oc FAN

Banky looks at Holden for a beat Then he brings his
pointer fingers together mimicing Holdens shared
moment gesture

Holden shrugs slightly then crosses his fingers - as if
to say ‘hopefully’
oc FAN
You were just carrying that guy
anyway

Banky sort of smiles at the OC Holden Then he offers
his own thumbs up - as to say good luck

BANKY
