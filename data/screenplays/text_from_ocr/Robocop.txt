AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE

The OLD MAN (a corporate king benevolent now because
hes unapproachable) and Dick Jones confer quietly

OLD MAN
Well that gives us some time
What about this police thing What
seems to be the problem

JONES ee
The Union’s been bitching ever since
we took over Now they have a media
issue and they’re throwing their
weight around you know the usual
crap I’m confident we‘ll turn things
around in the next phase of the
takeover

OLD MAN ee
Mmmm Good Very good
(to the room)
OK let‘’s get started I’ve had a
dream for more than a decade now
and I’ve asked you all to share it
with me In six months we begin
construction of Delta City
(he waves toward
the model)
where Old Detroit now stands I grew
up in Qld Detroit as a child I
Played in its streets Those same
streets have become a breeding ground

REV 8486

for crime and social decay Before we
employ the 2 million workers that will
breathe life into this city again we
must pacify Old Detroit

(pauses for effect)
Although shifts in the tax structure
have created an economy ideal for
corperate growth community services
in this case Law Enforcement have
suffered I think it’s time we gave
something back Dick

SS JONES
As he stands the monitors above him roll a slick ete
montage

JONES

Take a close look at the track
record of this company and youl)
see that we have gambled in markets
traditionally regarded as “non—
profit”hospitalsprisons
space exploration

(he turns on the charisma)
I say good business is where you
find it As you know weve entered
into a contract with the city to run
local law enforcement But at
Security Concepts we believe an effi-
cient police force is only part of
the solution

The information on the monitors above him suggest a
corporation with the scope and influence of an emerging
Western nation Jones is putting on a good show

JONES
»2-NO we need something more We
need a twenty-four a day police
officer A cop who doesn’t need
to eat or sleep A cop with superior
firepower and the reflexes to use it
