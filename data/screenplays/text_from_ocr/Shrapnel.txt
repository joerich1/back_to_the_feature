INT ARCHIVES - DAY

A small door SLIDES OPEN like a priest’s confessional
revealing the face of OSTERMAN late 40’s bald clean
shaven in a bargain-brand suit He’s gaunt pale run a bit
ragged The only hint of vitality of strength comes from
those deep-set focused EYES Wells of memory

Osterman slides a small piece of paper to an UNSEEN PERSON on
the other side of the wall After a moment the Unseen
Person slides a stack of books and other documents back
through the small door to Osterman

AT A RESEARCH TABLE

Now it’s clear This is not a church this is some sort
of library or government building Harsh angular
claustrophobic all painted an unpleasant gray-green
Fluorescent lights hang above

There will be no title card indicating the year But the
wardrobe the hair the general design will all indicate that
this is the mid-1970s

Osterman coldly studiously pours over the documents All of
the text is IN GERMAN After some searching one PARTICULAR
DOCUMENT catches his eye

IN THE COPY ROOM

Osterman feeds a few German pfennigs into a massive copy
machine He sets the document down presses COPY

CUT TO
The title over black

SHRAPNEL

EXT BRAMBLE PATCH —- DAY

A tuft of BROWN WOOL snagged on a thorn blowing in the
wind RACK FOCUS to FORD bearded mid-50’s with a few
extra pounds slapped onto a strong frame He carries a large
pack on his back

Ford eyes the wool for a moment then carefully plucks it
rubs it between his fingers
EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

CREDITS ROLL AS Ford moves through the breathtaking Rocky
Mountain wilderness A world away from those cramped spaces
in Germany Still the mid-1970s

We follow Ford as he--

-- runs his fingers over a smooth patch of bark worn down by
antlers or horns --

-- finds a bedding area a patch of flat grass where some
sort of large animal has been sleeping --

-- spots a break in the foliage where old trees and young
trees meet He looks to the ground spots a faint trail
which leads all the way up to a--

ROCKY SLOPE

Ford looks out across a yawning gap sees a gang of majestic
BIGHORN SHEEP with massive spiralling horns frolicking on
the mountainside More like small deer than sheep They
exercise complete control over the dangerous terrain
bouncing from rock to rock prancing along tiny ledges and
bounding over gaps as big as twenty feet

Ford also witnesses one of the legendary bighorn sheep HEAD
BUTTING CONTESTS Two males stare each other down Stomp
their hooves Smash into each other Again and again

After several head butts one of the RAMS is clearly
defeated He scurries off the hillside in shame

Ford hops to his feet follows the animal

EXT MOUNTAIN STREAM - DAY

Ford runs alongside the water a faint limp in his gait but
still surprisingly fast and agile for a man his age

But then Ford’s face TWISTS IN PAIN
He awkwardly stumbles to the ground reaches for his THIGH
wincing He takes slow deep breaths massages the muscles

in his thigh

After a moment the pain subsides Ford gets back to his
feet hobbles off
EXT WATERING HOLE —- DAY

Ford scans the bank spots a whole zoo’s worth of ANIMAL
TRACKS in the mud

He pulls a heavily worn BOOK out of his pack It’s a 1944
ARMY FIELD MANUAL He flips through the book finds
instructions on how to build a makeshift sniper blind or in
this case a HUNTING BLIND Ford gathers branches and bark
constructs his blind near the water’s edge

LATER The blind is complete Ford waits inside with a
clear view of the spot where the stream meets the pond

The perfect ambush point

It’s not long before the BIGHORN RAM marches out of the trees
and up to the water’s edge

Ford studies the creature The thick bristling coat The
muscles beneath the flesh The wild eyes

Then Ford reaches into his pack pulls out--
--a CAMERA with a long TELEPHOTO LENS attached to it

Ford snaps several shots of the bighorn sheep And something
like a SMILE infiltrates Ford’s face as he captures the wild
beauty of the animal forever on film

Then the SOUND of Ford’s automatic CAMERA REWIND spooks the
ram The creature scurries off AS CREDITS END

EXT FORD’S CABIN —- LATER THAT DAY

You could call it a cabin I guess But it wasn’t built by
the pioneers and it’s certainly not more than ten years old
It’s set in a small clearing embraced by the forest on all
sides A dirt road winds past the front door

Ford trudges out of the surrounding woods past his gleaming
yellow 1974 RANGE ROVER and into--

INT FORD’S CABIN

Inside ain’t too shabby either Electricity gas running
water -- all luxuries in this neck of the woods It has a
faux-rustic feel though Several mounted animal heads and
horns hang on the wall along with a number of nature-themed
photographs all of a similar style
One PHOTOGRAPH stands out A black-and-white Ansel Adams-
esque shot of a distinctive MOUNTAIN PEAK The sharp tip is
completely barren Treeless Smaller PHOTOS of this peak
taken from different angles also hang on the wall

Ford sets his backpack and his camera down onto the dinner
table He switches on a small radio--

REPORTER
(over radio)
--Marines died in an offensive
south of Pleiku yesterday
Official reports indicate that 43
Viet Cong combatants were killed--

IN A MAKESHIFT DARKROOM

Bathed in red light Ford painstakingly develops his
photographs of the bighorn sheep

REPORTER
(over radio)
--place the total American dead at
36802 A postscript the war in
Vietnam now surpasses the Korean
War in total American lives lost--

IN THE BATHROOM

Ford turns off the water steps out of the shower wraps a
towel around his waist But beneath the towel the bottom
half of a LARGE SCAR is visible

COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER
(over radio)
How many licks does it take to get
to the Tootsie Roll center of a
Tootsie Pop The world may never--

Ford switches off the radio Then he winces a bit regards
the scar on his thigh This is the same injury that brought
him to the ground while tracking the bighorn sheep

He grabs a BOTTLE OF ASPIRIN pops the top but it’s EMPTY

FORD
Shit
IE FORD’S RANGE ROVER - DAY
A LIGHT RAIN falls as Ford hops into his car starts it up
VOOM-- VOOM-- VOOM-- Engine won’t start

FORD
Aw come on

EXT FORDS RANGE ROVER - MOMENTS LATER

Ford lifts the hood scrutinizes the inscrutable European
innards of his Range Rover He checks a few of the basic
fluids Everything seems to be in order He probes deeper
feeling around for the problem

OSTERMAN (0S)
(German accent)
Engine trouble

Ford peeks out from under the hood sees OSTERMAN standing
out in the dirt road Osterman wears rustic hiking garb
clean and pressed He carries a heavy backpack and holds a
large walking stick

The fact that Osterman is a complete stranger isn’t of much
concern to Ford -- hikers and hunters amble past his cabin
all the time But Osterman’s faint GERMAN ACCENT is enough
to give Ford at least a momentary pause

FORD
Long way from home

OSTERMAN
That is the whole idea On
sabbatical For my health

FORD
Mountain air and all that

Osterman nods Ford goes back to his engine hoping the
conversation is over

OSTERMAN
(re the car)
Do you mind if I take a look

FORD
I’ve got it covered thanks
OSTERMAN
It is no trouble

FORD
Just hafta tow it to one of the
import places in the city

OSTERMAN
Please British automobiles are a
hobby of mine

FORD
(with force)
Really don’t need your help

Osterman stops

FORD
(regaining some composure)
Thanks for the offer

Osterman smiles politely then turns to walk away Ford goes
back to his engine but after a moment

FORD
Hey

Osterman stops turns back

Ford shows the aspirin bottle to Osterman He shakes the
bottle indicating that it’s empty

FORD
There’s this shooting pain In my
thigh Comes and goes Shrapnel
trying to fight its way out
Always puts me in a bad mood

LATER

Raining a bit harder now Ford sits in the driver’s seat
Osterman has his face buried in the guts of the car He uses
a wrench to make some adjustments then pulls his head out

looks to Ford

OSTERMAN
Try it

VOOM-- VOOM-- VOOM--

FORD
Goddammit
OSTERMAN
Patience patience

Osterman dives back under the hood probing around He
sticks his hand deep into the machinery PULLS SOMETHING OUT
He gives Ford a nod Ford turns the key

VOOM-- VOOM-- VOOM-- VROOOOOOOOOOM

FORD
Ha You’re a miracle worker

Osterman shows Ford a small CHUNK OF RUBBER

OSTERMAN
(impersonating a priest)
The body of Christ

Osterman uses the chunk to draw the sign of the cross He
presents the rubber shard like a Communion wafer to Ford

FORD
Broken gasket

OSTERMAN
Wedged in the flywheel These are
not like your American cars Very
finicky You must be extremely
vigilant about maintenance Always
listening for any sign of--

FORD
(gruff but good-natured)
Starting to get that shooting pain
again

OSTERMAN

Ah yes yes that is the end of
my lecture

The rain is COMING DOWN HARD now Osterman is drenched
FORD
I should head into town ‘fore dark

Appreciate the help mister

OSTERMAN
Felix Osterman

FORD
Benjamin-- Ben Ford

Osterman and Ford exchange a brief weak handshake
FORD
Take it easy

Osterman nods as Ford rolls up the window drives off

IE FORD’S RANGE ROVER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

Ford pulls away from his cabin bumping along the now muddy
road But THUNDER claps LIGHTNING flashes RAIN floods
the windshield

He peeks into the sideview mirror sees Osterman pathetically
slogging and stumbling his way through the driving rain

Just when Osterman starts to fade into the murky gray of the
storm Ford HITS THE BRAKES

EXT BACK DOWN THE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
Ford pulls up next to Osterman barely cracks his window

FORD
Sure you’re alright out here

OSTERMAN
(in good spirits)
I’m “roughing it”

FORD
Look it’s probably too dangerous
to be driving anyway I’m gonna go
inside ride it out

OSTERMAN
I would hate to be a burden

Lightning flashes Thunder booms

FORD
Look I could lie to you say it’s
the Christian in me wants you to
come inside Truth is if
something bad happens to you out
here it’s gonna come back and bite
me in the ass

(trying to remember )

Hippies had a word for that

OSTERMAN
Yes I believe it’s “karma”
INT FORD’S CABIN - DAY

On a STEAMING PILE OF MEAT roasting in the oven Ford
checks on the status of his shepherd’s pie takes a bite
sees if it needs more cooking time

Rain and thunder still echo outside the cabin walls

OSTERMAN (0S)
Your work

Osterman also stands in the cabin drying his wet hair with a
towel and admiring the photographs of the MOUNTAIN PEAK

FORD
Yep ‘Bout ten miles into the
valley Called Sky--

OSTERMAN
SKY GOD PEAK I’ve read about it

Osterman’s eyes drift to a GERMAN LUGER PISTOL mounted in a
frame behind a plate of glass over the fireplace
Throughout his time in the cabin Osterman’s eyes will

frequently return to that pistol

For now he looks away from the pistol finds a high-tech
COMPOUND HUNTING BOW leaning against the wall Hanging
beside the bow is Ford’s HUNTING SATCHEL containing
everything he needs on the hunt his quiver of arrows
matches walkie-talkies extra bowstring even his old 1944
Army field manual

OSTERMAN
You are a hunter

Ford closes the oven door

FORD
(re food)
Few more minutes
(back to Osterman)
What Hunt Every now and again

Ford sits down at the table takes a load off

OSTERMAN
I must confess I did not come
halfway round the world only for
the mountain air
(they lock eyes)
I came for a trophy

FORD
Elk

OSTERMAN
Bighorn

FORD

They gave you a tag Lucky dog
D’you pull some strings with Fish
and Wildlife

OSTERMAN
Just patience I applied 18 months
ago for one male five to nine

years old

(eyes lighting up)
Perhaps we should go together
Tomorrow After the storm the air
will be very clear You can add
another head to your collection

Ford grabs his compound hunting bow off the wall eyes it

FORD
(dodging the question)
So what’re you using

Osterman reaches into his pack pulls out a huge unstrung
WOODEN LONGBOW

FORD
Jesus Christ buddy Fighting the
Indian Wars

Osterman quickly efficiently strings his longbow

OSTERMAN
The only kind I have ever used
Since I was a small boy Strong
clean draw Not jerky like yours

FORD
(re his compound bow)
Well this won’t snap

OSTERMAN
Any bow can snap

FORD
This ain’t wood

Ford taps his compound bow on the table Then Osterman
reaches across gently takes the compound bow from Ford

OSTERMAN
(softly)
I worked in a munitions plant
before the War

War First time it’s been mentioned explicitly Ford can’t
help but react at least microscopically to the word

OSTERMAN

Tiny air bubbles find their way
into the mold during the
manufacturing process Each time
the string is drawn back the
fiberglass is weakened bit by bit

(into Ford’s eyes)
Then one day after tracking your
quarry over grass and mud and
rock through the snow and rain
and hot sun just when you have
that prize ram in your sites--

BAM Osterman SLAMS HIS FIST down onto the table The
noise startles Ford Then an AWKWARD SILENCE

DING The oven

FORD
Youre a weird duck

OSTERMAN
(German quack)
Meck-meck

INT FORD’S CABIN - LATER THAT NIGHT
The sun has set But the storm still rages outside

Ford slaps a steaming pile of shepherd’s pie onto his own
plate He spoons another helping onto a plate for Osterman

OSTERMAN
No no please I’m fine

FORD
Just try it alright I got way
more than I need and it doesn’t
keep real well
(beat)
Or don’t It’s a free country

OSTERMAN
If you insist

Osterman takes a bite cracks a smile He likes it

FORD
Good right I told you

Osterman nods goes for a few more bites And then

OSTERMAN
You know I envy you Benjamin--
Ben

FORD
(chuckling a bit)
Uh oh

OSTERMAN
You seem to be a real
(struggling for the word)
American Like those mountain
men I used to read about as a boy
Tough Uncomplicated Immune to
the troubles of the world

FORD
(focusing on his meal)
I don’t know about all that

OSTERMAN
Come now you probably killed our
dinner yourself
(a sudden thought)
Oh it almost slipped my mind
Something to return the favor--

Osterman bends down searches through his backpack

OSTERMAN
Just a moment

-- and pulls out a big bottle of Jagermeister

OSTERMAN
For the true hunters

Osterman stands grabs two coffee cups from the

FORD
Little bit late for me

OSTERMAN
Don’t tell me the mountain man has
a drinking problem

cupboard

Osterman pours a cup for himself and a cup for Ford He
glugs his own drink down looks across the table to Ford

OSTERMAN
Always drink with a friend I have
many rules Most I break Never
that one
(pours another)
AnstoBen

Osterman swigs another

And the peer pressure gets the best of Ford He tosses the
bitter stuff down his throat slams the cup down

CUT TO
Less booze in the bottle now Redder faces
OSTERMAN
See that is the difference between
you and I You drink to forget the
past I drink to remember
FORD
Yeah well I don’t remember
much
(grabs the Jagermeister)
But this this I remember
(he pours)
More booze than blood over there
and there was a lot of blood
At the mention of war -- of bloodshed -- Ford’s eyes turn

deadly serious

Osterman’s eyes on the other hand start to glimmer ever so
slightly

OSTERMAN

(toasting)
To the War

Ford stares Osterman down doesn’t raise his glass

OSTERMAN
You don’t miss anything about it

FORD
Only a nut misses it

OSTERMAN
But the War was good for you no
FORD
You don’t know anything about how
the War was for me buddy

OSTERMAN
I was unclear Good for America
The War left a dozen countries in
ruin and America America rose
from the ashes They say your
Founding Fathers are Washington
Jefferson I say Eisenhower
Patton and who Audie Murphy
These are the mythic heroes who
created America

FORD
S’there something wrong with
that

Osterman turns back to the photograph of Sky God Peak

OSTERMAN
(making a show of changing
the subject)
You know I do a bit of photography
myself

FORD
No no go on I’m listening

OSTERMAN

Do not misunderstand me -- the Nazi
war machine the doctrine of Aryan
supremacy -- you may say that these
were rotten things And you may be
correct to say this But the truth
is that America had no business
fighting a war in Europe England
and France hoodwinked you into
doing their dirty work for them
Fresh meat for the grinder What
did they ever do for you that they
would deserve this Of course it
all worked out well for you in the
end You have become the mightiest
nation in the history of mankind
But is this really such a blessing

(a moment)
“Der Kopf liigt schwer dass eine
Krone tragt”

(translating)
“Heavy hangs the head that wears a
crown”

Ford and Osterman remain silent
A tense moment
FORD
(breaking the tension)
Hey
Ford grabs the bottle of Jagermeister
FORD
Few more of these we’ll forget we
even had this conversation
And pours himself another

CUT TO

The bottle is almost empty now and outside the rain seems
to have let up a bit

The party has moved over to the FIREPLACE Ford and Osterman
are plastered Ford more than Osterman They sing an old
war song Lili Marlene -- each trying to out-sing the other
The photograph of Sky God Peak hangs behind them

FORD OSTERMAN
You wait where that lantern Wenn sich die spdten Nebel
softly gleams drehn
Your sweet face seems Werd ich bei der Laterne
To haunt my dreams stehn
My Lilly of the Lamplight Wie einst Lili Marleen
My own Lilly Marlene Wie einst Lili Marleen

The song ends with a ludicrously loud and off-key final note
Ford and Osterman laugh till their eyes water

As the laughter dies down Osterman reaches for the bottle of
Jagermeister But he doesn’t pour He brings the label to
his eyes and squints--

OSTERMAN
(reading off the label)
Das ist des Jaégers Ehrenschild daB
er beschiitzt und hegt sein Wild
weidmannisch jagt wie sich’s
gehért den Schdpfer im Geschdpfe

ehrt
(a moment)

Ist gedicht A poem
(translating)

(MORE)

OSTERMAN (contd)
“It is the hunter’s honor that he
protects and preserves his game
hunts sportsmanlike and honors the
Creator in his creatures”

Osterman points to a mounted ELK HEAD hanging on the wall

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
Did you honor the Creator in him

After a moment

FORD
I didn’t kill him
(a pause)
Haven’t killed anything in thirty
years

Ford really shouldn’t start telling secrets to a complete
stranger but they’ve been building up for so long--

FORD (CONTD)
My kid’s in college A senior
Studying engineering last I heard
His dad tears buildings down he
wants to build them back up again
All evens out I guess Might see
him at Graduation in Spring If my
wife-- my ex-wife brings the new
guy more likely I won’t He’s
more of a father to him anyway
Don’t want to confuse things

Ford picks his camera up off the table cradles it

FORD (CONTD)
This is all bullshit actually
Bullshit house car Bullshit 300
dollar fiberglass bow Bullshit
heads on the wall They were here
when I bought the place

OSTERMAN
(with a smile)
Some mountain man you are

Without aiming the camera at anything in particular Ford
hits the EXPOSURE button SNAP -- SNAP -- SNAP -- SNAP --

FORD
Used to spend summers in a place
like this though Not as fancy
But mountains Aspen trees Pine
Hunting with my dad

(MORE )
FORD(contd)
I got this spread-- I thought I’d
be able to find something I lost
a long time ago

OSTERMAN
Something you lost

Once again Osterman’s eyes wander to the LUGER PISTOL
mounted above the fireplace Hold on it for a moment
Osterman turns back to Ford

OSTERMAN
Tell me about your father I never
knew mine

FORD
It’s boring stuff

OSTERMAN
Perfect for old men like us to
calm our nerves

FORD
The guy you think I am tough
uncomplicated that was my
father

OSTERMAN

He taught you to use a bow

Then

For the first time Ford smiles broadly unapologetically

FORD

I remember him waking me up early
to beat the sun and hating him
for it Just hating him

(fondly)
But then once you get out there
On the mountain It all changes
Just sitting ‘round not saying a
word sometimes you don’t take a
shot all day but that’s the good
stuff you know That’s what it’s
all about

OSTERMAN
Why did you stop

A tough question Ford doesn’t know how to answer it

OSTERMAN
(after a moment)
You loved it once didn’t you
(they lock eyes)
(MORE )

OSTERMAN (contd)
The hunt The rush that comes
right before a kill And
sometimes you miss that feeling

A long pause

FORD
Yeah maybe

Osterman lets that sink in for a moment before--

OSTERMAN
Then come with me tomorrow We can
relive old times

Total silence Even the rain has stopped

FORD
(breaking the tension)
Sly bastard
(cracking a grin)
You just want a spotter to help bag
that big ram of yours

Osterman stands shrugs smiles He collects his things

OSTERMAN
I had to try
FORD
Shit Gettin’ me all teary-eyed
embarrassing
OSTERMAN
No nothing to be ashamed of

Osterman checks to make sure that the rain has stopped
OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
The west fork At dawn You are
more than welcome to join me
(looks back)
Ill even give you the first shot
Osterman slips out the door leaving Ford alone in his chair

Ford pours himself another swig of Jagermeister gulps it

Then he turns and grabs his hunting bow He slowly pulls
the drawstring back and releases

And as the string snaps back into place--

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY MOUNTAINS - DAWN

Ford and Osterman move swiftly and silently through the
forest as the sun begins to crest over the snow-capped
mountains Ford carries his newfangled compound bow
Osterman holds his time-tested longbow

They are venturing DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS

EXT THICK PINES —- LATER THAT DAY

Ford and Osterman come to the edge of the trees peek into a

clearing where a wide swath of TALL GRASS and SKUNKWEED
PLANTS cut right through the middle of the forest

Ford nods pulls a walkie-talkie from his belt and tosses
to Osterman

FORD
Channel three

Osterman makes the adjustment They split up Ford heads
a nearby tree as Osterman disappears into the tall grass

FORD (0S)
(overlap)
So this old Italian guy he asks
the local padre to hear his
confession He’s getting on in
years and he wants to make peace
with God

EXT TREE BRANCH —- LATER

Perched up in a tree Ford TELLS A JOKE into his walkie-
talkie as he watches the tall grass below Osterman must
hidden somewhere in the underbrush on the forest floor

FORD (CONTD)
So he slides open the little door
in the confessional says “Father
back during World War II this
beautiful woman knocked on my door
asked me to protect her from the
enemy So I hid her up in the
attic”

Ford’s BOW rests nearby and his HUNTING SATCHEL is
strapped across his back

it

for

be
FORD (CONTD)
The priest says “That’s a
wonderful thing you did my son
There’s no need to confess” “But
it’s worse Father” the old guy
says “this girl she started to
repay me with sexual favors you
know like blowjobs”

Ford takes his finger off the walkie-talkie button seeing if

he can get a rise out of Osterman

SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH Just the static on the walkie-talkie

Osterman must not be amused or maybe he’s just too focused
on the hunt to respond Either way we won’t see him

He’s hidden in the forest

FORD (CONT’D)
So the priest thinks for a sec
then he says “You were both in
great danger and war makes sinners
of us all You are forgiven my
son” “Thank you Father that’s a
great load off my mind but I got
one more question--”

But before Ford can deliver the punchline--
OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)

You see him

Ford looks below sees a BIGHORN RAM in the tall

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Do you have a shot
FORD
Yeah yeah I’ll try

Ford clips his walkie-talkie to his belt

He nocks a grisly-looking BROADHEAD ARROW draws
back aims at the ram--

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Take him

But Ford freezes

grass

the string

OSTERMAN

(goading through walkie-

talkie)
He’s nothing but a bag of meat
and flesh and tendon Put him
out of his misery

(beat)
It’s the easiest thing in the
world

Ford holds the bowstring tight keeps his eyes fixed on the
ram below

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Take the shot

But Ford sets his bow back down on the tree branch speaks
into his walkie-talkie

FORD
Sorry

SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH Static on the walkie-talkie

FORD (CONT’D)
You want him He’s yours

Another bit of silence before

OSTERMAN
(quietly through walkie-
talkie)
I know

A high-pitched SQUELCH SIGNAL screeches out of Ford’s walkie-
talkie The ram scurries off

FORD
What the hell was that

SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH

FORD
You spooked him

And then--

OSTERMAN
(softly through walkie-
talkie)
Corporal Ford you have changed

Ford can sense from the sound of Osterman’s voice that
something is wrong

FORD
Osterman

--CHIK-- the walkie-talkie activates
OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)

Das ist des Jaégers Ehrenschild

Ford listens as Osterman recites the poem from the
Jagermeister bottle

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
(through walkie-talkie)
-daB er beschiitzt und hegt sein
Wild weidmdénnisch jagt wie sich’s
gehért den Schdpfer im Geschdpfe
ehrt
The walkie-talkie goes silent again
Ford can’t just sit there
So he inches his fingers towards his hunting bow
Closer and closer
And the woods are quiet
Until
A distant TWANG And the SNAP of breaking leaves
AN ARROW FLIES
Right at Ford
Barely enough time to react
Ford ducks
Arrow misses
Ford grabs at his bow but fumbles knocks it off the branch--

Falling--

And CRACK The fiberglass bow breaks

FORD
Fuck

Twang Snap Arrow

It misses But throws Ford off balance He teeters a
moment before falling off the branch

Ford awkwardly hits the ground No serious damage but he’s
shaken up

His BOW IS BROKEN

But he still has his HUNTING SATCHEL strapped across his
back It holds his arrow quiver matches extra bowstring
and most importantly his Army field manual It’s better
than nothing

Twang Snap Another arrow

Over Ford’s head

Ford drops assesses his situation back into the pine
trees or forward into the tall grass

More cover up ahead Ford army-crawls into the--

TALL GRASS

Ford crawls at least twenty yards deep into the grass He
hops off his belly into a squat He spins his head scanning
all 360 degrees

Just the sound of wind now

And the tall grass rustling in the breeze

Ford pops his head up Scanning Very quick Back down
again Didn’t see anything

He pops up down again Still sees nothing Osterman must
also be hiding in the tall grass

--CHIK-- the walkie-talkie activates
OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)

Don’t worry Corporal

Ford turns the volume down on his walkie-talkie very low

OSTERMAN (CONT ’D)
(through walkie-talkie)
If you can’t see me I can’t see
you

Ford tries to control his breathing remain silent

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Check your left jacket pocket
Corporal Ford

Ford looks over his shoulder then reaches into his jacket
pocket pulls out a series of PHOTOGRAPHS As he flips
through them confusion and fear fill his face

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
(through walkie-talkie)
See I have been bitten by the
Photography bug myself

The photographs are all shots of Ford in and around his
cabin They are hidden camera shots clearly taken by
Osterman from the woods surrounding Ford’s cabin

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
(through walkie-talkie)
As you can tell I prefer candid
photography I find landscapes a
bit dull

Photos of Ford hanging his clothes out to dry washing his
car fixing his roof There are even photos of Ford inside
his cabin in the shower eating reading All shot through
the windows using a telephoto lens

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
(through walkie-talkie)
The pathetic Ansel Adams imitations
on your wall for instance they
do nothing for me

FORD
(putting it together)
You fucked my engine up

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Not permanently

FORD
What’s your plan huh What do you
want from me

A moment

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
To finish what we started

FORD
The fuck are you talking about

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
War is so complicated bogged
down in religion politics

FORD
(grasping at straws)
You think we’re out in the middle
of nowhere Rangers come through
here all the time hikers hunters
If I scream there’s a good chance
someone’1l hear me

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Then scream

Osterman has called Ford’s bluff

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Two men Alone in the wilderness
Not another living soul in sight
(a moment)
War distilled

Ford’s sweating now Osterman could be anywhere hiding in
the tall grass

FORD
This isn’t a fair fight

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
You of all people should know
(beat)
-- war is not fair

Another bit of tense silence before--
A twang--

And the rapid-fire THWIT-THWIT-THWIT-THWIT of an arrow
cutting through the tall grass

The arrow shoots past Ford He drops to his belly

He listens--

Starts to stand again--

THWIT-THWIT-THWIT-THWIT--

Another arrow whizzes past Ford drops back to the ground

He looks around frantically can’t see a damn thing grass is
too thick

THWIT-THWIT-THWIT-THWIT--
Another arrow This one lower Just over his head

Ford’s had enough He leaps to his feet breaks into a run--

PINEY WOODS

Ford sprints into the forest Plenty of open space here
easy for Osterman to get a clean shot

As Ford runs he looks to the right spots a huge BLOWDOWN
AREA in the distance -- where a recent snow or rainstorm has
knocked acres and acres of pine trees to the ground

Better cover there Ford veers right

But out of the corner of his eye Ford spots Osterman running
out of the tall grass chasing him

IN THE BLOWDOWN

A mass of fallen trees Tangled branches

No order No clear line of sight

Ford fights his way into the confusion

Awkwardly pulls himself over rotten logs

Beneath fallen trees

Osterman reaches the blowdown area runs in after Ford

And the chase is on Not a fast chase though A slow

grinding stilted chase Ford and Osterman are like human
machetes hacking their way through an evergreen jungle

Osterman finds a clear patch He stops nocks an arrow
fires at Ford

But the arrow RICOCHETS off the fallen trees
Ford picks up the pace Almost out of the blowdown
Osterman lines up another shot fires

Again the arrow ricochets to the ground

IN THE TALL PINES
Ford breaks out of the blowdown back into the forest
Osterman is still stuck back in the morass

Ford runs hard trying to separate himself from Osterman

BACK IN THE BLOWDOWN

Osterman strings another arrow coolly draws the string back
Tough shot -- blocked by fallen trees and logs

If he can just thread the needle

TWANG The arrow flies

IN THE TALL PINES
Ford sprints away--
--but the arrow CONNECTS

FORD

Ford drops to the forest floor
Hyperventilating he opens his eyes looks down and sees--
--an arrow pierced right through the MUSCLES of his calf

FORD
Jesus

It didn’t hit the Achilles tendon Ford can at least be
thankful for that

Ford has dropped below the edge of a small draw
He looks back can’t see Osterman
And Osterman can’t see him

Osterman is still stuck back in the blowdown a good distance
away Ford has a bit of a head start

Ford struggles to his feet limps down the hillside But his
injured leg causes him to trip roll down the hill and into--
A MOUNTAIN GRAVEYARD

--where he slams into a stone

Ford looks around sees that he’s in a small clearing filled
with large rocks

But these rocks have been carved shaped laid out in an
organized pattern

It’s a small CEMETERY No more than twenty graves in all
probably part of a long-dead mining town

The cemetery has been reclaimed by the forest A century of
brutal Rocky Mountain winters has left nothing but the
faintest traces of the names on the headstones

Ford glances back up the hill -- no sign of Osterman yet

He looks down to his WOUNDED LEG The arrow is stuck halfway
through his ankle Half poking out one side half poking out
the other Thankfully it’s a thin-tipped arrow otherwise
it would have caused a lot more damage

Ford stifles the small bit of vomit that often comes at the
mere sight of such a wound

And then
Ford grabs the arrow closes his eyes grits his teeth
He’s got no choice
But to PULL THE ARROW out of his leg
FORD

(quietly)
Urgghhh

This may be the WORST PAIN that Ford has ever experienced
but he can’t be too loud risk giving away his position

Just as Ford extracts the arrow--
THWIK
An arrow shoots into the dirt right next to Ford

Ford spins back sees Osterman on the hilltop taking aim
with a second arrow

Ford leaps behind one of the large gravestones for cover
Another arrow flies hits the dirt even closer to Ford
Ford gets small making sure no part of his body is exposed

But another arrow zings past hits the ground just inches
away from Ford’s hand

Too close for comfort

Ford looks downhill spots a low STONE WALL overgrown with
vines Good cover

But he has to expose himself to get there
Ford takes a deep breath

And leaps out from behind the gravestone--
TWING

An arrow sails past barely misses him

BEHIND THE STONE WALL
Ford dives behind the wall makes sure he hasn’t been hit

He gets to his feet runslimps along the length of the wall

BACK IN THE MOUNTAIN GRAVEYARD

Osterman runs down out of the trees and into graveyard He
creeps slowly towards the edge of the stone wall Ford
could be waiting for him there

He pokes his head around the corner but Ford is gone

Osterman makes his way along the stone wall tracking Ford

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE STONE WALL - LATER
Osterman stops senses something
And then

WELL REVEAL Ford perched high up in the branches of a pine
tree Almost directly over Osterman’s head

Ford is well-hidden by the darkness and by the thick branches
of the pine tree But he’s not completely invisible

Osterman looks left looks right looks to the ground

And then he LOOKS UP

Right into the branches of the pine tree

Right at Ford

And Ford looks back at him

Each holds his stare for a few moments

But Osterman must not be able to see Ford because--
Osterman breaks away continues down the path

Ford waits for the footsteps to fade into silence before
quietly crawling out of the tree

EXT MOUNTAIN GHOST TOWN - LATER

Ford shuffles out of the forest and into--

--the crumbling remains of an old mining community set ina
small clearing surrounded by and interspersed with thick
pine trees This must be the same community that built the
nearby stone wall and cemetery

Five or six structures houses a small church a barn with a
small corral attached to it Only one of the cabins is
completely intact The rest are in various stages of
decomposition walls toppled over roofs caved in

Ford limps through the village Carefully Quietly

Osterman could be waiting around any corner

Ford tiptoes towards the only cabin that hasn’t collapsed--

OUTSIDE THE LOG CABIN

Ford comes to the front door peeks through the crack and
into the musty darkness

Looks empty

Ford opens the door--

INSIDE THE LOG CABIN

--and steps into the darkness scanning for anything he can
use as a weapon old fork shovel piece of scrap metal

He finds nothing
Ford makes for the door--
--but a SOUND echoes outside the cabin

Ford presses his face against the wall peeks through the
small gaps between the logs where the chinking has dissolved

He sees nothing

Ford moves to another wall finds a peephole and sees--
Osterman creeping through the ghost town

Bow and arrow in hand

Ford has nowhere to run He heads towards the back of the
cabin looking for another way out--

He finds a small PANTRY DOOR on the back wall of the cabin
He grabs the handle tries to pull it open

But rust has sealed the door shut
Ford pulls harder

But when the door flies open--

A whole cloud of bats fly out of the pantry swarming around
the darkness of the cabin

OUTSIDE THE LOG CABIN

Osterman hears the screeching and the flapping of wings He
snaps his head back towards the cabin--

And sees the bats flying out of the chimney

He creeps towards the cabin

INSIDE THE LOG CABIN
Ford has to do something
But he can’t go out the front door

And there’s no back door

OUTSIDE THE LOG CABIN

Osterman slowly opens the front door--

INSIDE THE LOG CABIN

--and steps into the darkness

It seems empty and silent now

Then Osterman spots the HALF-OPENED PANTRY DOOR
He slowly glides towards the pantry

And peeks inside

Empty

OUTSIDE THE LOG CABIN

Osterman steps back outside He looks ahead spots SOMETHING
WHITE laying on the ground

He steps towards the object and picks it up It’s one of the
PHOTOS that Osterman took of Ford Ford must have
accidentally dropped it

As Osterman crumples the photograph in his hands

WELL REVEAL

Ford laying motionless on the roof of the cabin above and
behind Osterman’s head

Osterman stops Senses that something is wrong

Ford takes this opportunity to silently roll over towards the
other side of the roof out of sight--

--just as Osterman turns back towards the cabin

Again Osterman sees nothing unusual He turns walks away
from the cabin

BEHIND THE LOG CABIN

Ford rolls off the edge of the roof drops to the ground
without making a noise limps into--

THE WOODS

Ford hobbles deep into the forest wincing every time he puts
weight on his wounded leg

Finally he feels as if he has some breathing room He
stops leans his head against a tree catches his breath

WHAP
An arrow hits the tree

Ford turns back sees Osterman approaching slowly nocking
another arrow

OSTERMAN
(with a smile)
I told you I wanted a trophy

Ford is way too exhausted and in far too much pain to run

FORD
(muttering)
Goddam chickenshit

Osterman inches closer keeps his bow trained on Ford

OSTERMAN
You are calling me a coward

FORD
Called you a chickenshit That’s a
couple rungs down

Osterman chuckles

FORD
What’s so funny

OSTERMAN
I find it amusing that you would
question my manhood given what I
know about you

This silences Ford for a moment until

FORD
You don’t know shit about me
OSTERMAN
I know you did something very
naughty
FORD

Fuck you Pissed about something I
did during the War I killed your
friend You killed my friend

I’ve made peace with my sins It’s
over

OSTERMAN
The War will never be over

Osterman pulls a pair of plasticuffs from his pocket tosses
them to Ford

OSTERMAN
Behind your back

Ford grudgingly cuffs his hands behind his back

FORD
You wanted to kill me Why didn’t
you do it last night Fuck this
running and hiding bullshit

OSTERMAN
But that is the only way to kill an
American these days

As Osterman speaks he performs the action pretending to
hide behind a tree pop out fire hide again

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
Hide where the American cannot see
you And when the time is right
pop out from behind your tree fire
off a few cheap shots and disappear
again

Osterman looks to the wound just above Ford’s heel

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
Der Kopf liigt schwer dass eine
Krone tragt

Osterman pulls a coiled rope from his arm tosses it up and
over a high tree branch

FORD
Gonna hang me

OSTERMAN
Would you like me to

Osterman flashes a smile

OSTERMAN
(bad American accent)
I don’t want to kill you buddy I
just want to shoot the shit

FORD
So let’s shoot the shit

OSTERMAN
(back to his normal voice)
But I want your undivided
attention

Osterman tosses the end of the rope to Ford

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
So please tie that through the
hole in your leg

FORD
Fuck you Kraut

OSTERMAN
(eyes lighting up)
There he is The man I have been
looking for

Osterman brings the tip of the arrow closer to Ford’s skull

OSTERMAN
Tie it Please

Ford doesn’t have much of a choice He finds the end of the
rope grits his teeth

And threads the rope THROUGH THE FRESH WOUND in his leg

Ford strings the rope all the way through

OSTERMAN
Make it tight Go on

Ford ties the knot around his ankle
The pain is beyond severe now
Ford must be very nearly in shock

OSTERMAN
Yah yah Good

Osterman grabs the other end of the rope
And starts to pull down
As he pulls Ford is STRUNG UP by his ankle

FORD

Osterman pulls Ford all the way off the ground
Ford is too weak to fight back He just hangs there

OSTERMAN
Now you will be the old Italian
man and I will be the priest
(looks around)
And the forest will be our
confessional

Ford is in too much pain to respond
Osterman puts a hand in front of his face He slides his

hand out of the way as if it were the small door ona
confessional window

OSTERMAN
What are your sins my son
(Ford doesn’t answer)
And you say “Bless me Father for
I have sinned It has been so-and-
so many days since my last

confession” You know what it
means to confess no Of course
you do--

(impersonating Ford with

mock tears)
“My wife left me” “My son calls
another man father” “I miss my
dear old daddy” that sort of
thing

(back to normal)
I confess every week More if I
find the time But I reject the
absolution I carry my sins with
me wherever I go I bathe in them

Osterman turns his back on Ford for a moment rests his bow
against a nearby tree

OSTERMAN
You really believed that you could
retreat to the mountains Forget
the War Forget the past

Ford is too busy trying to squeeze his hands out of their
bindings to answer

OSTERMAN
(theatrically)
War is a hunter Once he has your
scent you cannot shake him No
matter how fast you run he is
always at your tail No matter

where you hide -- even here in the
bosom of the earth -- he will find
you

(a moment)
And do you know what happens
then

Osterman turns back towards Ford holding a frightening
German COMBAT KNIFE

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
He will spill your guts

With his finger Osterman pokes at Ford’s belly strangely
almost playfully

OSTERMAN
This is an American idiom no To
spill one’s guts To share one’s
most intimate secrets

Osterman pulls Ford’s shirt down a bit revealing the bare
stomach

OSTERMAN
So spill your guts or I will
spill them for you

Osterman takes a quick swipe at Ford’s belly He’s MISSING
INTENTIONALLY but at any moment he could decide to slice
open Ford’s stomach FOR REAL

FORD
Stop -- stop --

Ford swipes again And again

FORD
I don’t know what you want from me

Another swipe

OSTERMAN
It won’t take much you know Not
a lot of muscle here One good cut
and it will all come tumbling out
onto the ground

Another

FORD
Please Stop

OSTERMAN
Not too painful though You will
be alive for a long time Which is
good Because I want you to see
all the little creatures who scurry
out of the forest to nibble on your
insides

Osterman scrunches up his face like a squirrel or rabbit
twitches his nose

FORD
Wait -- wait -- you want a war --
cut me down -- we can have a war --

OSTERMAN
Too late for that

Osterman takes a few more knife swipes
Quicker

Closer

Ford has to do something

FORD

Ford HEAD BUTTS Osterman
Osterman stumbles back onto the ground nose bloody
The knife falls to the ground right beneath Ford

Ford flexes pulls his hands free of their bindings He
reaches down tries to grab the knife

Just out of reach
Osterman shakes his head wipes the blood from his face

Ford extends his arm grabs the knife He twists his body
tries to cut the rope He takes a few swipes misses

Osterman starts to come to his senses
Ford slices the rope drops to the ground
Osterman grabs at his bow and arrow

But Ford tackles him

Osterman knocks the knife from Ford’s hand It lands nearby
They each try to grab at it

Ford and Osterman grapple on their knees amidst the dirt and
dying leaves on the forest floor

Punches Elbows Chokeholds

Ford gets some weight behind a kick to Osterman’s chest
knocks him back Ford dives grabs the knife

He leaps on top of Osterman tries to bring the knife down
onto Osterman’s already bloody face

Osterman puts his hands up blocking the knife

Ford looks down and sees--
A TATTOO
On the underside of Osterman’s arm It’s a single letter--
Le)
We may not know what it means but it looks like Ford does

Ford doesn’t have much time to think about it because
Osterman delivers a kick to the gut steals back his knife

They roll across the forest floor
And the game is reversed

Osterman is on top now knife in hand The blade dances
above Ford’s face flirting with his eyes his jugular

A knee to Osterman’s groin

The knife flies away Osterman and Ford explode apart Ford
dives for the knife Osterman goes for his bow and arrow

Ford GRABS THE KNIFE spins back ready to attack--

But Osterman’s already back on his feet bow in hand nocking
another arrow

Ford has to run He charges off leaps down a nearby hill
Osterman fires his arrow
Misses

Ford slides down a muddy slope towards--

A WIDE RIVER

Ford rolls to the river bank and without a second thought
leaps into the water

The current carries him downstream
As Ford floats away he looks up to the hilltop overlooking
the river sees the small form of Osterman receding in the

distance Into nothing

DISSOLVE TO

EXT RIVER BANK —- LATER THAT DAY

Ford pulls himself onto the beach shivering struggling to
breathe Close to hypothermia Not only that there’s still
a piece of rope looped through the wound on his ankle

He still holds Osterman’s GERMAN COMBAT KNIFE in his hand

He slips it into his hunting satchel hobbles into the woods
IN A SMALL CAVE

Ford scrambles under a low rock overhang just barely a cave
He takes the hunting satchel off his back Then he slips
off his shirt and pants tries to wipe the excess water from
his skin

IN THE SURROUNDING FOREST

Ford in bare feet and boxer shorts frantically collects
kindling and firewood shivering the whole time

IN A SMALL CAVE

Ford teeth chattering stacks the wood over a pile of
kindling He pulls a dry matchbox out of his hunting

satchel Only a few matches inside

He lights several matches but they all fail to ignite the
kindling

Finally the kindling CATCHES FIRE Ford gently blows on the
flames giving them life

LATER

Ford’s clothes hang on a spit drying As he warms his body
he pulls his trusty ARMY FIELD MANUAL out of his hunting
satchel start to flip through the wet pages

ON THE FOREST FLOOR

Back in his dry clothes Ford crawls on his hands and knees
getting a close-up view of the plants on the ground

He finds what he’s looking for -- a small patch of wild
onions He checks them against a drawing in his field
manual then gathers up a whole bunch

UNDER A PINE TREE

Ford plucks fresh pine needles off the branch

IN A SMALL CAVE - THAT NIGHT

Next to the roaring fire Ford lays the Army field manual out
in front of him following the instructions

He places an old rusted coffee can filled with water next to
the flames He drops the pine needles into the water

LATER he tears small strips off of his undershirt
presumably to be used as bandages

LATER the water boils He carefully takes the pine needle
tea off the flames He lets it cool for a moment before
chugging it all in a single gulp

His face relaxes a bit

Then Ford places a stick between his teeth And PULLS THE
ROPE out of his wound He punches the rock floor in pain

After a moment he calms down uses one of his bandages to
wipe the blood from his wound

He double-checks his Army field manual stands up and
awkwardly sticks his leg out in front of him He unzips his
pants and URINATES on his ankle sterilizing the wound

Next he chews up a bit of the wild onion smears the
poultice onto both the entry and the exit wounds He takes
another bandage strip wraps it tight around his leg But
just as he finishes wrapping--

--the RED CALL LIGHT on his walkie-talkie flashes

Ford ties his bandage up grabs the walkie-talkie thinks for
a moment before TURNING UP the volume knob

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
-Wenn wir bei der Laterne stehn
Wie einst Lili Marleen
Wie einst Lili Marleen

Ford listens as Osterman sings an eerily quiet almost
guttural version of Lili Marlene The walkie-talkie’s signal
is VERY WEAK dominated by static

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Schon rief der Posten
Sie blasen Zapfenstreich--

Almost impulsively Ford clicks the TALK BUTTON

FORD
I saw your tattoo

Silence

FORD
What Now you have nothing to say

A bit more silence before--

OSTERMAN
(through walkie-talkie)
Shooting pains keeping you up
again

FORD
I’m more concerned about the Nazi
psychopath trying to hunt me down
and kill me

EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE FOREST - NIGHT —- INTERCUT

CLOSE ON Osterman walking through the moonlit woods We
won’t know exactly where he is could be on the other side
of the valley could be right over Ford’s shoulder

OSTERMAN
Eh the signal is very weak I
am probably miles away I would
not be too concerned

Ford doesn’t respond

So Osterman starts to philosophize either because he
likes the sound of his own voice or because he wants to
trick Ford into speaking through the walkie-talkie thus
helping to give away his location

OSTERMAN
I have a question for you
(beat)
Does God exist

FORD
Who gives a shit

OSTERMAN

I know he exists

(a moment)
When I was six my father was dead
in the trenches two brothers and
three uncles also I asked my
mother if there truly was a God
how could He allow such things to
happen

(another moment)
But now after all I have seen
I realize that these terrible
things they do not prove the
absence of God They prove his
existence Men alone are not
capable of such magnificent evil

Ford listens not necessarily paying attention to any of
Osterman’s ramblings He’s LISTENING TO THE SIGNAL And
unfortunately it seems to be GETTING STRONGER

OSTERMAN

(quoting the Bible)
“When the Lord your God brings you
into the land you are entering to
possess and drives before you many
nations -- the Hittites
Girgashites Amorites Canaanites
Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites
seven nations larger and stronger
than you -- then you must destroy
them totally Make no treaty with
them and show them no mercy”

(beat)
Do you see My god is a great
troll in the sky

The signal is very clear now

OSTERMAN

There I have spilled my guts
Your turn

(no response)
Can’t we be two honest men Alone
In the wilderness Then we will
have balance

(still nothing)
Coming in very clear now eh

Then the hint of a SOUND in the woods Ford looks out into
the night He turns down the volume on his walkie-talkie
covers up his fire limps out of the cave and into the--

MOONLIT FOREST

Ford tiptoes through the trees looking for any sign of
Osterman But the woods are silent Ford is alone

Ford brings the walkie-talkie back to his mouth--
FORD
You want your war Come and get
it

Before Osterman can respond Ford flings his walkie-talkie at
a nearby tree It smashes into pieces

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE

The morning sun melts a few more drops off of the snow caps

AT THE RIVER BANK

Osterman makes his way along the water’s edge finds the spot
where Ford came ashore

He follows Ford’s trail into the forest

UP IN AN ASPEN TREE

Ford wounded leg and all shimmies his way up the trunk
carrying Osterman’s combat knife in his teeth

He cuts a large branch loose

IN A SMALL CAVE

Osterman bends down over the remnants of Ford’s fire He
feels the residual warmth

IN THE SHOOTING GROVE

With his Army field manual open in front of him Ford
finishes stripping the bark off of the aspen branch

He pulls a spool of spare BOWSTRING from his hunting satchel
strings it up on his MAKESHIFT BOW

IN THE FOREST

Osterman finds the shattered pieces of Ford’s walkie-talkie

IN THE SHOOTING GROVE
Ford strings one of the arrows from his quiver onto his
makeshift bow He draws the string back carefully aims at a
nearby tree fires
The arrow MISSES THE TARGET
But it FLIES CLEAN

Another miss

Another miss

Another miss

Finally Ford HITS THE TARGET

BY A MOUNTAIN STREAM

Ford runs along the bank If we’re particularly keen
viewers well recognize this stream from Ford’s first
bighorn sheep tracking

IN THE SHOOTING GROVE

Osterman finds Ford’s target tree He runs his fingers over
the holes in the bark

AT THE WATERING HOLE

Ford follows the widening stream all the way to its mouth
the same quiet mountain pond where he first snapped the
photographs of the bighorn sheep

He looks to the ground sees animal tracks in the mud

Then he sees the broken remnants of his makeshift blind

Ford sets to work rebuilding his hunting blind He props up
the walls lays out branches for the roof

BY A MOUNTAIN STREAM

Osterman follows Ford’s footprints in the banks of the
mountain stream He looks up ahead and sees--

--the mountain pond in the distance

AT THE WATERING HOLE

Ford finishes rebuilding his deer blind adds extra clumps of
moss and dirt to camouflage it

Then he crawls inside gets the lay of the land He has a
full view of the pond Most importantly he has a CLEAR SHOT
at the area where the stream meets the pond

The perfect ambush point

OVERLOOKING THE WATERING HOLE

Osterman lays out on a hill overlooking the pond He peers
through his binoculars

He FOCUSES IN on the area where the stream meets the pond

Osterman is a smart guy He also realizes that this would be
a perfect ambush point

And he’s not going to fall for the trap

He scans the water’s edge and the surrounding trees until
he spots a SLIGHT IRREGULARITY in the terrain

It’s Ford’s hunting blind

This means that Osterman is at Ford’s rear

IN THE HUNTING BLIND

Ford waits inside looking out at the pond

BEHIND THE HUNTING BLIND

Osterman sneaks up quietly behind Ford’s blind

IN THE HUNTING BLIND

But Ford CRAWLS BACK OUT of his deer blind shirtless and
shoeless wearing only his pants He sneaks along the
water’s edge careful not to leave any footprints

BEHIND THE DEER BLIND

Osterman stops in his tracks This is too easy

He drops to the ground hides in the underbrush reassesses
the situation

AT THE WATERING HOLE

Ford digs a hole in the sand near the edge of the pond
First with his knife then with a large piece of wood
BEHIND THE DEER BLIND

Osterman peers through the underbrush He knows Ford has
laid a SECOND TRAP

Now Osterman has to find it

IN THE FOXHOLE

The hole is four feet deep now Ford hops inside Just
enough space for him to crouch

Ford nocks an arrow checks to make sure that he has enough
room to fully draw and release

He does

BEHIND THE DEER BLIND

Osterman spots a patch of ground that looks almost completely
normal to the untrained eye But Osterman is a hunter He
notices the slightly darker color of the leaves and the fact
that they are packed a bit too tightly

Osterman looks for a way to attack the trap

He spots a TREE on the other side of the foxhole

IN THE FOXHOLE

Ford places large branches and leaves on the roof of the
hole concealing himself

UP IN A TREE

Osterman climbs onto a branch quietly as possible

Down below in the distance he sees the ROOF of Ford’s
foxhole

Osterman nocks his arrow draws it back

And fires RIGHT INTO THE FOXHOLE

EXT OUTSIDE THE FOXHOLE - MOMENTS LATER

Osterman slowly creeps up to the edge of the hole peers down
inside but SEES NOTHING in the darkness

And then
Behind Osterman
Ripples in the pond

Ford’s head silently breaks the surface of the water His
face and body are covered with a layer of mud and grime

He rises smoothly without a sound

Comes to his feet

Draws his arrow back

Osterman only has time to turn his head around before--
--Ford fires an arrow

We won’t see the arrow connect with its target just Ford’s
reaction emotionless at first then slight disgust
followed by a hint of morbid curiosity

Also the sound of Osterman’s guttural pained moans

Ford drops his bow to his side walks out of the water

And then we’ll see Osterman

It ain’t pretty

Ford’s arrow has hit Osterman’s face But Osterman is still
very much alive because the arrow has gone in through
Osterman’s right cheek and out his left

Not only that The arrowhead is stuck in a tree Osterman’s
bleeding face is pinned right up against the bark

Osterman is clearly in shock Awkwardly groaning Shaking
slightly Trying hard not to move

Ford steps to Osterman analyzes the wounds up close

FORD
It’s okay it’s okay

Osterman can’t talk He moves his eyes making eye contact
with Ford

FORD
Just hold still

Although it seems like Ford is helping Osterman there’s
something ominous -- or at least odd -- about the matter-of-
fact way that Ford examines Osterman’s wounds

Ford looks into Osterman’s mouth

FORD
You’re okay You’1ll survive
Didn’t hit the teeth Let me see
your tongue

Ford peeks deeper into Osterman’s mouth

FORD
There it is I see it Looks
okay You’1ll be able to talk
That’s good

Ford grabs hold of the arrow Osterman lets out a faint
squeal of pain

FORD
I know it hurts but it’s not
bad pretty superficial

Ford pulls the combat knife from his belt starts to saw
through the arrow

He tries to do it carefully but the vibration of the sawing
is clearly amplifying Osterman’s pain

And then Osterman’s eyes roll back in his head

FORD
Whoa

Ford catches Osterman before he falls to the ground With
his free hand Ford awkwardly makes a few last cuts on the
arrow freeing Osterman from the tree

He pockets his knife slings Osterman’s unconscious body over
his shoulder

DISSOLVE TO

INT FORD’S CABIN - NIGHT
On Osterman’s eyes Flickering back to life

Out to his face The arrow has been removed leaving two
fresh wounds on his cheeks

Osterman lays belly up on some sort of flat surface

Then TWO HANDS enter frame use a bottle of hydrogen
peroxide and gauze to finish cleaning the wounds on
Osterman’s cheeks

FORD (0S)
Didn’t have it removed Risky

Ford runs his fingers over the tiny “0” tattoo on the
underside of Osterman’s arm

FORD (0S)
That mean you’re proud of what you
did

Osterman looks up sees Ford towering over him Ford is
still SHIRTLESS The mud that covered him has now hardened
into a cracked brown SHELL that covers his body and arms
Only his face and hands are clean

FORD (CONTD)
Or maybe you don’t want to forget
(beat)
You bathe yourself in your sins
right

Osterman strains looks down at the rest of his body Only
now does he see that he is TIED DOWN to Ford’s table
The same table where he and Ford shar
nights before

ed a meal just a few

FORD
This time you be the old Italian
guy and I’1l be the priest
(beat)

What’s your name

Osterman makes a few weak attempts at
bindings But they’re too tight He

FORD
You don’t want to tell me

OSTERMAN
Fel--

Osterman winces It hurts to talk

OSTERMAN
Felix Osterman

FORD
Your real name

OSTERMAN
I do not-- understand--

FORD

wriggling out of his
can barely move

Come on spill your guts Osterman

Ford pokes Osterman in the belly

FORD
Spill ‘em

He pokes harder

FORD
Spill those guts

But Osterman STARTS TO LAUGH

FORD
Stop

Osterman keeps laughing Ford stops

FORD
Stop it

poking

OSTERMAN
I am ticklish

Frustration fills Ford’s face He’s trying to be as
threatening as possible but all Osterman can do is giggle

Ford steps away from the table

Soon after Osterman hears commotion at the kitchen counter
behind him He cranes his neck back and sees Ford grabbing
pitcher and a bag of sugar out of the cupboard

Then Ford dumps a dozen FRESH LEMONS out onto the counter

FORD
When life gives you lemons right

Ford cuts several of the lemons in half starts to extract

the juice using a manual JUICER He sticks the juicer right
into the heart of the fruit

And twists
The fresh lemon juice drips into the pitcher

As Ford squeezes Osterman’s eyes find the framed photograph
of Sky God Peak

FORD
(pained )
Damn

Ford massages his thigh It’s that shooting pain again
He recovers grabs an old strainer

FORD
Like the pulp

Osterman doesn’t answer Ford nods puts the strainer back

FORD
Yeah me too More natural that
way

Ford grabs the bag of sugar starts to pour it into the
pitcher but only a few granules flow out Empty

FORD
Damn
(beat)
Well just substitute

Ford reaches for a SALT CANISTER pours a liberal dose of
salt into the lemonade pitcher He slowly stirs the
concoction with a wooden spoon

Osterman knows what’s coming

And he smiles

OSTERMAN
You think a little bit of pain will
get me to break eh

FORD
I sure don’t know

OSTERMAN
What if I like pain

Osterman may be a masochist but he may also be bluffing We
won’t quite be able to tell

FORD
This might be your lucky day

Ford grabs two glasses out of the cupboard pours two
servings of lemonade into them He takes a sip from one of
the glasses quickly spits it back out

FORD
(grossed out)
Whew

Ford brings the glasses to Osterman

FORD
(re the tattoo)
“Oo” it’s a blood type

Ford displays the lemonade glasses to Osterman

FORD
What’s your real name

OSTERMAN
(smiling)
I am Felix Osterman

Ford tries to serve the lemonade to Osterman Osterman
closes his mouth

Ford grabs Osterman’s face awkwardly pries open his mouth
pours the lemonade in

Osterman’s eyes go red He tries to spit it out but Ford
covers his nose and mouth Osterman gulps it down

FORD
You want another

OSTERMAN
Yes please

Ford pours the other glass over Osterman’s face

Osterman unleashes a roar of pain which transforms into
roar of laughter

When the laughter dies down--

OSTERMAN
Now that I have seen this side of
you I feel that we are kindred
spirits
(a moment)

I will tell you my name
Ford leans down

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
But you did not break me yes

Ford grudgingly nods

OSTERMAN
You must say it

FORD
Okay

OSTERMAN
Say you did not break me

FORD
I didn’t break you

And then

OSTERMAN
Vogel Ernst Vogel

FORD
Rank

OSTERMAN

Haupsturmfiihrer Ernst Leopold
Vogel SS-Division Totenkopf

FORD

Haupsturmfiihrer Ach tu Lieber I
bet a lot of people would kill to
have that information

(beat)
Poles Russians

(beat)
The Mossad

Osterman shows no fear just a realization that these are not
empty threats

FORD
Totenkopf
(trying to remember )
That mean you were stationed at the
camps

OSTERMAN
I fought for two years on the
front When I was wounded they
transferred me to Arbeitsdorf then
Belzec
(a moment)
- and Dachau

Ford reacts slightly at the mention of Dachau

FORD
What did you do there In the
camps

OSTERMAN

I was an extractor Of
information

(into Ford’s eyes)
You would have been good at it

FORD
(feigning a morbid
curiosity)
You think so Tell me about it

Osterman doesn’t know where to start

FORD
D’you put a rope through their
ankle string them up from a tree
I hear that works

OSTERMAN
The sight of a gun is enough to get
most people talking
FORD
And if it doesn’t
OSTERMAN
Dogs
FORD

Come on I want the sick stuff
The grisly details The guns and
dogs don’t work then what

OSTERMAN
(after a moment)
Wasserfultermethode

FORD
That sounds fun what does it
mean

OSTERMAN

Water torture

FORD
Yeah yeah how does that work

OSTERMAN
The prisoner is restrained A
piece of cloth is shoved into his

mouth
FORD
Nice nice
OSTERMAN

Water is poured onto the prisoner’s
face Into his mouth Until he

breaks
FORD
Beautiful
OSTERMAN
Leaves no trace No bruises or
scars
FORD

How many people you do that to
Osterman doesn’t want to answer

FORD
How many

OSTERMAN
I don’t know hundreds
FORD

Anyone ever do it to you
Osterman laughs quietly
But in the midst of the pained laughter Ford cuts Osterman’s
ropes violently drags him into--
THE BATHROOM

Ford tosses Osterman into the bathtub face up He turns on
the cold water

FORD
How’m I doing so far

Ford reaches back grabs a washcloth stuffs it into
Osterman’s mouth

FORD
Like this

Ford forces Osterman’s face under the water

FORD
How long I keep you under

Osterman starts to cough and sputter

FORD
Five seconds

Osterman gags flails his arms tries to break free

FORD
Ten

Osterman can’t take much more of this

FORD
Should we try fifteen

Then Ford pulls Osterman back out from under the faucet
pulls out the washcloth

FORD
Why did you come here huh

Osterman is still coughing
FORD
What do you want from me

Osterman spits up water gets his breath back
OSTERMAN

(breathless)
You already know--

FORD
I don’t know Tell me
OSTERMAN
--would defeat-- the whole purpose--
FORD
What purpose
OSTERMAN
--very painful-- to open up old
wounds -- you are afraid-- I

understand--

Ford starts to push Osterman’s under the faucet but--

OSTERMAN
You cannot break me -- understand
(wild-eyed)
My will is strong -- tempered in

the fires of hell --

FORD
I’ve been to hell too

Ford moves Osterman back under the water again

OSTERMAN
Hell

Osterman spits up a bit of water And then he SMILES

If

he had less water in his lungs he might even laugh a bit

He’s still breathless but he can speak more easily now

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
Two years on the front lines in
Europe Then back to your fat wife
and bouncing baby boy Back to
your mountain hideaway

(catching his breath)

Spend a month on the Stalin line
then we may talk about hell

FORD
I sacrificed everything for that
fucking War

OSTERMAN
You sacrificed nothing

Those words
Echo for a moment
And then

They unleash a sort of primal rage in Ford He grabs
Osterman’s shoulders presses him under the water

Osterman fights against Ford’s weight flopping around in the
bathtub like a fish on dry land He pops up a few times
steals quicks breaths

But Ford’s grip is very strong

Osterman may enjoy pain but he doesn’t want to die

From under the water Osterman spots Ford’s RADIO sitting
close to the bathtub

As Ford holds him down Osterman grabs at the radio
Ford is too enraged to even see Osterman reaching
Osterman extends his arm
Stretches his fingers
Grabs the radio
Throws it into the water
Osterman and Ford both go STIFF start to convulse
The light bulb in the bathroom begins to dim and pulse
Ford tries to break free from Osterman
But the electrical current keeps them locked together
POP

The fuse breaks The light bulb goes dark

EXT FORD’S CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

All of the interior and exterior lights on the house go dark
leaving nothing but the moonlight as illumination

INT FORD’S CABIN - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

The connection between Ford and Osterman is broken Osterman
splashes back into the tub floating

Motionless

Ford tumbles backwards bangs his head on the sink He
crumples to the floor

Also motionless

DISSOLVE TO

INT FORD’S CABIN - BATHROOM - DUSK
Ford and Osterman remain motionless

aS a rat scurries out from under the sink across the
bathroom floor

The rat stops sniffs Ford’s body then skitters off again

DISSOLVE TO

INT FORD’S CABIN - BATHROOM - THAT MORNING
Sunlight starts to peek through the window
It hits Ford’s face His eyes crack open a bit

He’s still sprawled out on the floor his back against the
sink Blood drips from a wound on his head

Ford tries to move but it’s VERY DIFFICULT The electric
shock has wreaked havoc on his body It will take a while to
fully recover

He strains just to turn his head and see--

Osterman still dead or unconscious floating in the bathtub

Ford tries to get to his feet be HE CAN’T DO IT He must be
operating at about 10 of his usual strength

Then Ford looks up to the sink above him sees--
Osterman’s ARMY KNIFE resting on the counter

Ford struggles with all his might to lift his arm but when
he tries to grab the knife--

--it DROPS to the floor

The NOISE echoes off the wet tile walls and stirs Osterman
from his unconscious state He’s alive but too dazed to
understand what’s happening at first

After a moment Osterman comes to his senses He tries to
stand but like Ford Osterman is very weak also working on

about 10 of his normal strength

Osterman summons all his power awkwardly pulls himself out
of the bathtub

He plops out onto the tile floor with a splash

Osterman can’t get to his feet He’ll have to crawl
slithering like a worm across the wet tiles

Meanwhile Ford tries to grab the nearby army knife--
--but his fingers AREN’T STRONG ENOUGH to hold their grip

Ford tries again and again to grip the knife but he just
can’t hold it tight

By this time Osterman has slithered past Ford starting to
wind his way into the MAIN ROOM

But Ford grabs Osterman’s leg

Osterman kicks at Ford shakes his leg free He drags
himself out of the bathroom and into the--

MAIN ROOM

Osterman crawls very slowly across the floor

He looks ahead eyes the MOUNTED LUGER PISTOL above the
mantle over the fireplace

Ford drags himself out of the bathroom into the main room
pursuing Osterman

He still can’t grip the army knife but he uses his arms and
his body to slide the knife along the floor in front of him

It’s a race between snails each moving very slowly each
leaving a wet trail behind

Osterman reaches the fireplace He looks around trying to
find something to prop himself up with

He grabs a fire poker uses it to help get to his feet
Ford crawls closer

Osterman grabs the mantle ledge pulls his weakened body up
into a standing position

SMASHES the glass--

And grabs the Luger pistol But he doesn’t aim it at Ford
He points it up in the air and pulls the trigger

CLICK CLICK CLICK
It’s empty Osterman slips it into his belt

Osterman has a little more strength in him now He hobbles
back towards the dinner table pulls the ROPE off

He limps over to Ford tries to tie him up

This turn of events gives Ford a sudden burst of energy He
pulls Osterman to the ground

What follows is an incredibly slow awkward fistfight
wrestling match between Ford and Osterman Their movements
never reach more than 14 speed

Weak slaps Wild kicks Flailing punches

Almost all of the shots miss their targets

Ford finally manages to get a grip on the combat knife takes
a few manic swipes at Osterman

But Osterman knocks the knife from his hands
Finally Osterman pins Ford down in a sort of half-chokehold
He binds Ford’s hands behind his back holds the rest of the

rope in his hands like a leash

Osterman picks his knife up off the floor sticks it into his
belt Then he drags the weakened Ford through the cabin--

EXT FORD’S CABIN - DAY
--and out the front door

Osterman looks left and right making sure there are no
errant hikers or campers around

FORD
Help Somebody help

Ford tries to shout but his voice is as weak as the rest of
his body

OSTERMAN
Quiet

Osterman spins back PISTOL-WHIPS Ford in the jaw
FORD
(weaker quieter)

Help help fire

Osterman spots a greasy old wash towel hanging on a chair
outside the cabin

He grabs the towel ties it around Ford’s mouth gagging him

Osterman opens the back of Ford’s Range Rover He heaves
Ford into one of the back seats ties him down to the seat

Ford’s cries for help are MUFFLED by his gag

IE FORD’S RANGE ROVER - PARKED
Osterman slips into the front seat still very weak himself

He flips down the sun visor looks in the small mirror
studies the wounds in his cheeks

Still fresh

Osterman pops open the glove compartment rummages around
doesn’t find what he’s looking for

Then he slides open a drawer beneath the passenger seat
grabs a small FIRST AID KIT He opens it up and pulls out a
roll of Ace bandages

While looking in the mirror he carefully wraps the bandage
around the bottom half of his face leaving a space for his
mouth He ties the bandage off

When he’s finished wrapping he looks something like a cross
between an OLD WEST BANDIT with a bandana wrapped around his
mouth and an EGYPTIAN MUMMY

Osterman finds the keys starts the car up
VOOM-- VOOM-- VOOM--

The engine isn’t turning over Osterman doesn’t seem too
phased He takes a breath calmly turns the key again

VOOM-- VOOM-- VOOM-- VRROOOOOMMMMM

Osterman hits the accelerator drives up the road

EXT DIRT ROAD

The Range Rover winds deep into the woods high into the
mountains far away from civilization

IE FORDS RANGE ROVER - DRIVING - LATER

Ford tries to fight out of his bindings He lets out a LOUD
MUFFLED GROAN and a final BURST OF STRENGTH but he cannot
break free

His body goes limp giving up

OSTERMAN
Can’t move eh

Still driving Osterman barely glances back If he makes any
eye contact with Ford it’s through the rearview mirror

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)

I know how you feel Three years
Innsbruk Hospital Paralyzed
from the neck down I could barely
talk And you know how much I love
to talk

(smiling)
There was a beautiful nurse
Rebekka always dressed in white
Always with a smile on her face

(his smile fades)
Her job

(he can barely get these

words out)
Her job was to collect the piss and
the shit from a pan under my bed

Ford’s tired eyes focus in on the back of Osterman head
On what looks like a BULLETHOLE SCAR at the base of his neck
OSTERMAN

But the feeling came back Slowly
I began to teach myself to

eat to write to speak to
walk like a man and not a cripple
I had no father or mother no
wife or child to help me

(a moment)

Do you know what kept me going
Ford couldn’t answer even if he wanted to

OSTERMAN
Hate

Ford stares at that scar on Osterman’s neck

And it looks like it might mean something to him

EXT BASE OF SKY GOD PEAK - LATER THAT DAY

Osterman stops the car at a spot where the dirt road narrows
into nothing more than a cattle run He gathers several
items including the first aid kit into a small pack

He steps out of the car opens the back pulls Ford out

OSTERMAN
We walk from here

Osterman unties the gag from Ford’s mouth

FORD
Where are we going

OSTERMAN
To the top

Ford looks up and sees--

A PEAK rising into the sky Sharp and conical The same one
captured in Ford’s framed photograph

SKY GOD PEAK

FORD

OSTERMAN
Take off your shoes

Ford doesn’t

Osterman pulls the Luger pistol out of his pocket
This doesn’t impress Ford It’s empty

But then

Osterman pulls a LUGER MAGAZINE from his pocket sticks it
into his pistol

FORD
Bullshit

Osterman aims at a nearby tree fires
BANG Bark splinters off the tree

It’s the first gunshot we’ve heard And we’ll realize just
how loud violent and destructive the sound is

All the noises of nature are instantly muted

Ford listens as the gunshot echoes and reverberates into
silence -- it’s been a long time since he’s heard that sound

FORD
You had ‘em the whole time

Osterman doesn’t answer instead he turns his pistol on Ford

OSTERMAN
Shoes

Ford grudgingly kicks off his shoes
Osterman uses his pistol to gesture towards the trail

OSTERMAN
Move

Ford hesitates But he doesn’t have much of a choice

He starts up the trail into the thick pines Osterman walks
just behind him gun in hand

EXT ROCKY TRAIL —- LATER THAT DAY

Ford limps along the path trying his best to avoid the more
jagged rocks

If all that wasn’t enough it looks like THAT PAIN in Ford’s
thigh is starting to flare up

Osterman walks a few paces back As he walks he looks
through Ford’s hunting satchel

OSTERMAN
Lookee what I found

Ford stops turns back
Osterman pulls a BOTTLE OF ASPIRIN out of the first aid kit
He shakes the bottle like a baby rattle -- full of pills
OSTERMAN
The irony is killing me
(a moment)

Oh how rude Would you like one

I’m afraid I don’t have anything to

wash it down with though

Osterman snickers drops the aspirin bottle back into the
hunting satchel but SOMETHING ELSE catches his eye

OSTERMAN
Was ist dieses

Osterman pulls out Ford’s Army field manual Osterman reads
the cover ARMY FIELD MANUAL - 1944

OSTERMAN
Keep moving We can walk and talk

Ford turns back keeps walking up the trail

Osterman flips through the book

OSTERMAN
Let’s see
(flips)
Edible plants
(flips)
Lice removal
(flips)

Prophylactics

Osterman looks to Ford

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
God this is a useful little book
you have here

Osterman flips through the pages until--

OSTERMAN

Ah

(reading)
“Prisoners of war in the sense of
the present Convention are persons
belonging to et cetera et
cetera

(skipping ahead)
» members of the armed forces of
a Party to the conflict as well as
members of militias or volunteer
corps forming part of such armed
forces

(skipping further)
- in a language which they
understand No physical or moral
coercion shall be exercised against
protected persons et cetera et
cetera et cetera

Feigning boredom Osterman closes the field manual
OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
Why a bunch of clockmakers and
chocolatiers get to decide the
rules of war is really quite a
mystery to me

Osterman pockets the manual sees that they’ve come to a
small overlook

OSTERMAN
Stop here

Ford limps to a rock sits down catches his breath

Osterman holds the other end of the rope as he steps to the
edge of the overhang looks out on a SMALL VISTA below

The sun is hitting the landscape perfectly
It’s beautiful

Osterman breathes in that fresh mountain air

OSTERMAN

You would never find a view like
this in Germany Every square foot
is carved into farms
factories great castles

(a moment)
There is beauty in Germany But
there is an invisible layer of
blood caked over everything The
tourists they cannot see it But
I have special eyes Everywhere I
look I see red

But then Osterman squints looks to the horizon sees--

A single RADIO TOWER in the distance It’s almost invisible
but it does diminish the beauty of the landscape

Osterman turns back to Ford

OSTERMAN
I do not think you understand what
I am trying to do

FORD
Torture and kill me

Osterman ignores that last comment runs back to the edge of
the overlook gestures towards the magnificent view

OSTERMAN
Look

Ford does but the natural beauty doesn’t seem to have much
of an effect on him

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
God You have such a chance here
Unspoiled land As far as the eye
can see

As Osterman rambles with his BACK TURNED Ford takes the
opportunity to start rubbing his hand bindings against a
sharp rock in front of him

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
But you let it slip away

(a moment)
This is what happens -- don’t you
see -- this is what happens when

you forget the past Those who
forget it are doomed to repeat it
That is what they say isn’t it

He gestures back to the vista

OSTERMAN
What do you see

Osterman turns back--
--Ford stops his rubbing
OSTERMAN
Do you know what I see
(a moment)
I see the New World growing old
Osterman says it quietly oddly almost to himself

He keeps his eyes FIXED on the valley below for a moment

Ford has severed about half of the fibers in the rope He
tries to cut through the rest before--

OSTERMAN
Stand up

Osterman turns back Ford stands up his hands STILL BOUND
OSTERMAN
Walk
EXT STEEP TRAIL - LATER

Ford and Osterman are getting closer to the top The tip of
Sky God Peak looms a bit larger in the sky

Ford shuffles along the trail exhausted dehydrated
Osterman walks a few paces behind him

Ford looks down to the partially severed rope binding his
hands He subtly tries to pull his hands apart to break the
last few fibers

But he doesn’t have the strength

He trips falls to the ground

OSTERMAN
Get up

Ford doesn’t

OSTERMAN
Get up

Osterman kicks a cloud of dust and rocks into Ford’s face

OSTERMAN
Stehen Sie oben

Ford writhes a moment before--

FORD
(under his breath)
I get it

Osterman steps closer to Ford looking for an explanation

FORD (CONTD)
I get it alright I get what
youre trying to do

Ford looks up to Osterman

FORD (CONT’D)
You want me to say I shot you
That I put that hole in the back of
your neck

Osterman waits for more

FORD (CONTD)

Yeah maybe I did
(beat)

But I don’t remember doing it I
killed a lot of Krauts You’re
shit to me Less than shit I
don’t remember every shit I ever
took You wanted a confession
there it is So let me go Or
kill me

For a moment Osterman’s face softens but then

OSTERMAN
Keep moving

Ford thought his halfhearted confession might work
It didn’t

OSTERMAN
We are making good time

Ford doesn’t move Osterman aims his pistol at Ford’s head
Ford grudgingly gets to his feet takes a few more steps

FORD
Ahhh

Ford clutches his THIGH drops down onto a nearby rock
FORD
(pained )

Just wait wait

Ford massages his leg He unbuttons his pants pulls them
down a bit so that he can massage the SCAR directly

OSTERMAN
That shooting pain eh

Suddenly--

Osterman brings his knee down onto Ford’s chest pins him to
the ground Ford struggles to break free

OSTERMAN
Shrapnel

Osterman pulls his knife

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
Trying to fight its way out

And then--
Osterman CUTS OPEN the scar on Ford’s thigh
FORD
OSTERMAN
(mock scream)
Osterman’s fake scream blends into the first words of--
OSTERMAN
(singing)
Unsere beide Schatten

Sahn wie einer aus

It’s a shouty almost grotesque rendition of Lili Marlene

OSTERMAN
(singing)
DaB wir so lieb uns hatten
Das sah man gleich daraus

Ford clearly can’t move of his own accord

So Osterman tightens his leash and starts to DRAG Ford
further up the steep trail

OSTERMAN
(singing)
Und alle Leute solln es sehn
Wenn wir bei der Laterne stehn
Wie einst Lili Marleen
Wie einst Lili Marleen

EXT MOUNTAINS - THAT AFTERNOON

Clouds roll into the valley hovering around the tips of the
mountains stifling the sunlight

OSTERMAN (0S)
(overlap singing)
Deine Schritte kennt sie
Deinen zieren Gang
Alle Abend brennt sie
Doch mich vergaB sie lang
Und sollte mir ein Leids geschehn
Wer wird bei der Laterne stehen
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Mit dir Lili Marleen

EXT FURTHER UP THE TRAIL —- LATER

We follow a trail of blood in the dirt until we catch up
with Ford still being dragged up the trail by Osterman

Ford doesn’t look good Pale Dust in his face and mouth
Flirting with unconsciousness

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
(singing)
Aus dem stillen Raume
Aus der Erde Grund

Osterman continues to sing as he drags Ford up the trail It
looks like hard work too

OSTERMAN
(singing)
Hebt much wie im Traume
Dein verliebter Mund

As he’s dragged Ford looks down at his bleeding leg--
Another few hundred yards like this and he’1ll be dead

OSTERMAN (CONT’D)
(singing)
Wenn sich die spdten Nebel drehn
Werd ich bei der Laterne stehn--

FORD
Wait

Osterman keeps walking singing

OSTERMAN
(singing)
Wie einst Lili--

FORD
I need to wrap it

Osterman stops singing looks back

FORD
You want me-- to get to the top
alive I need-- to stop the
bleeding--

Osterman isn’t sure about this He thinks a moment then--
OSTERMAN
(exaggerated mommy voice)

Anything for little Benny

FORD
Bandages

Osterman nods goes to his knees starts to rifle through the
hunting satchel and the first aid kit looking for bandages

Ford waits--
OSTERMAN
Poor little Benny has a cut on his
leg Does he need mommy to clean
it up for him

--until Osterman TURNS HIS BACK

With his front two hands still tied together Ford sticks his
fingers INTO THE FRESH WOUND on his thigh

It hurts like hell but Ford can’t make a sound He clenches
his teeth to stifle the pain

And just as Osterman turns back around--
Ford pulls the NEEDLE OF SHRAPNEL out of his flesh
FORD
Ford swings his arm plunges the needle into the side of
Osterman’s chest

OSTERMAN

Osterman drops to his knees

The Luger falls lands halfway between Ford and Osterman
Both have a chance to grab it

But Ford and Osterman are still reeling from those quick
bursts of pain They writhe on the ground punch the dirt
waiting for the extreme pain to subside

Ford and Osterman both reach for the pistol

But Osterman grabs it--

Raises his arm--

And fires

But the shot is wild

Ford is already stumbling off the trail into the thick pine
trees using them as cover

Osterman gets off a few more random shots Then he
struggles to his feet

He feels around on his chest finds the needle of shrapnel
stuck there With a grunt he pulls the needle out

Osterman quickly examines the wound -- must not have hit the
lung or he’d be in a lot worse shape

He chases after Ford

EXT BURNED FOREST

Ford walks fast not quite running into a huge wasteland
filled with black skeletal leafless trees The remnants of
a massive forest fire

He checks back over his shoulder--

No sign of Osterman yet

Ford stops leans against a tree He takes a moment to
assess the wound on his thigh

It’s bleeding but the artery isn’t severed
A small bit of good news

Ford tears a strip of fabric from the bottom of his shirt
ties it around the wound

BANG BANG

Splinters of bark fly off the tree

Ford looks back sees--

Osterman in the distance gun in hand Like Ford his injury
prevents him from all-out running but he’s limping pretty
damn fast

Ford runs off

BANG BANG BANG

Osterman takes a few more shots misses them all Then he
dumps the empty magazine loads a fresh one

EXT HILLSIDE MINE

Ford runs out of the trees and into a man-made clearing He
looks up and sees--

A large metal structure comprised of several interconnected
buildings All built into the hillside

It’s an OLD MINE rusty falling apart collapsing in places
Must be at least fifty years since it was in operation

A large SLIDE of discolored rocks flow out of the main
entrance and down the hillside -- the scars left behind after
decades of mining
Ford starts to scramble up the rock slide
The rocks shift beneath his hands and feet
Very slow going

Down below Osterman pops out of the woods sees Ford
climbing up to the mine

Osterman lines up a shot fires--
Misses

Ford scrambles up the last few yards runs to the mine
out of Osterman’s range now

Osterman pockets his Luger starts climbing up the rock
after Ford

OUTSIDE THE MINE
Ford runs to the thick metal door tries to shut it

But it’s stuck

ON THE ROCK SLIDE

Osterman reaches the top sees Ford trying to shut the door

He draws his Luger--

INSIDE THE MINE

Ford slams his body against the door again and again trying

to force it shut

Osterman fires the Luger--

Just as Ford slams the door shut--

PING PING PING

The bullets ricochet off the thick metal door
PING PING

Ford grabs a large pipe braces it across the door

OUTSIDE THE MINE

Osterman runs up to the door tries to open it He bangs on
the door a few times but it won’t budge

INSIDE THE MINE

Ford peeks out through a small crack in the wall sees
Osterman outside

Osterman eyes the door for a few moments studying it trying
to find a way to break through Then he turns disappears
down the hill

DISSOLVE TO

INT MINE - VARIOUS ROOMS - LATER THAT DAY

Ford roams through the assorted chambers tunnels and rooms
of this dark wet labyrinth

He finds a piece of machinery with a sharp edge on it uses
it to cut his bonds
EXT FOREST NEXT TO THE MINE

With the mine behind his back in the distance Osterman
wanders through an area of FALLEN LOGS

After a bit of searching he finds a SMALL LOG that’s to his
liking He snaps off the branches
INT MINE - SUPPLY CLOSET

Ford kicks open the door steps into a room that seems to be
filled with nothing but cobwebs and dusty old apple crates

He rummages through the crates until he finds--
An old broom

Well it’s a start

He pours through more junk before finding--

A small pile of DEER ANTLERS

EXT MINE - DOOR

Osterman cradles the SMALL LOG in his arms

He winds up bashes the log into the metal door
BOOM

It’s a miniature battering ram

INT MINE - VARIOUS ROOMS
--BOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM-— —

The sound echoes through the mine

INT MINE - SUPPLY CLOSET

--BOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM- —

It echoes as Ford strips the few remaining pieces of straw
from the old broom

EXT MINE - DOOR

Osterman winds up smashes the door again

INT MINE - DOOR
--BOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM-— —

It echoes as the metal pipe brace starts to bend

INT MINE - SUPPLY CLOSET
--BOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM-— —

It echoes as Ford lashes several of the sharp-tipped antlers
to the tip of his broomstick

He’s creating an ANTLER CLUB

EXT MINE —- DOOR

Osterman bashes the door again

INT MINE - DOOR

--BOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM- —

It echoes as the metal pipe BENDS SEVERELY A few more hits
like that and the door will be knocked open

INT MINE - EQUIPMENT ROOM

--BOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM- —

It echoes as Ford runs his fingers along an ancient piece of
MINING EQUIPMENT Thick black grease rubs off on his hand

Ford uses the grease to cover his body and face

Camouflaging himself

EXT MINE - DAY

Osterman’s getting tired But he musters his strength
smashes the door again

INT MINE - DARK CORNER

--BOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM-—-—

It echoes as Ford now covered in black steps back into an
area of darkness

Completely invisible

EXT MINE —- DOOR

Osterman puts all his strength into this last swing--

INT MINE - DOOR
--and the door flies open
Osterman peeks inside before gliding into the darkness

The deeper he goes the less light there is The sound of
his heavy breathing echoes off the wet walls

After a few more careful steps
FORD (0S)
“When the Lord your God brings you
into the land you are entering to
possess and drives before you many
nations”

Ford’s distorted voice echoes through the darkness
doesn’t really sound like Ford at all

Osterman looks into the darkness doesn’t see Ford
He creeps deeper into the mine
FORD (CONTD)
“ the Hittites Girgashites
Amorites Canaanites Perizzites
Hivites and Jebusites seven
nations larger and stronger than
you”

Osterman listens for the source of the sound But it
to be directionless

Coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time
FORD (CONT’D)
“then you must destroy them
totally Make no treaty and show
them no mercy”
As Osterman creeps forward he STARTS TO SMILE
Ford is playing Osterman’s game
And Osterman loves it
He takes another step but hears FOOTSTEPS--

Whips his head--

Sees a FIGURE disappearing around the corner

AT A STAIRWELL

It

seems

Osterman rounds the corner comes to the top of a narrow

rickety set of steps
He looks down into the darkness

Sees nothing

OSTERMAN
Obergefreites Benjamin Ford

Osterman reverting to the role of an SS Haupsturmfiihrer
barks orders into the blackness

SOMEWHERE IN THE DARKNESS

We’re not exactly sure where Ford is

But he’s waiting quietly listening

AT A STAIRWELL
Osterman starts down the steps

OSTERMAN
Wir wissen daB Sie sind hierin

He tiptoes down step by step gun gripped tightly

LOWER LEVEL TUNNEL
Osterman steps into a dark corridor with a low ceiling
OSTERMAN
Treten Sie ab und Sie werden nicht
geschddigt sein

Osterman looks to the end of the tunnel sees a door

The door is cracked open slightly revealing just a sliver
a ROOM on the other side

Osterman moves towards the door
OSTERMAN
Kommen Sie heraus mit ihren Handen
auf ihrem Kopf

Osterman reaches the door

OSTERMAN
Zeigen Sie sich

of

Osterman kicks open the door looks into the room The floor

is covered with a thick layer of SAWDUST

Thin beams of sunlight shine through small holes in the roof

But Ford isn’t in the room
He’s in THE DARKNESS behind Osterman

FORD

Ford charges into the light swinging his antler club
The antlers connect with Osterman’s back

OSTERMAN

Osterman stumbles forward falls into--

THE SAWDUST ROOM
Osterman lands kicks up clouds of dust

The gun falls out of his hands disappears beneath the thick
layer of sawdust

Ford charges wildly into the room tries to smash his antler
club down onto Osterman

Osterman rolls out of the way
Ford takes another manic swing misses Osterman

Osterman gets his hand on a piece of RUSTY PIPE leaning
against the wall

Ford swipes his antler club
Osterman deflects the blow with his pipe

Ford and Osterman take wild swings at each other But
there’s nothing beautiful or skillful about this combat

It’s all brute force
Very ugly

As punches and kicks are thrown more and more sawdust is
kicked up off the ground

The dust particles float in the air obscuring the view

The more they fight the more dust rises into the air
the cloudier the room becomes

Osterman connects with a punch

Ford falls to the ground

But when he lands he feels something beneath the sawdust
Ford emerges with the gun

Osterman slaps it out of his hand

The gun disappears back into the sawdust

Instead of attacking each other Ford and Osterman begin
frantically sifting through the sawdust each trying to get
the gun first

They can hardly see a foot in front of themselves now
Sawdust particles are everywhere

In their mouths

In their eyes

And then--

Osterman finds the gun brings it up fires

But through all the dust and the darkness he can’t see Ford
BANG BANG

The muzzle blasts strobe illuminating the dark room for
split seconds

Still no sign of Ford

BANG BANG BANG

But these last few BLASTS--

--they REVEAL FORD--

--standing behind Osterman--

--with the rusty pipe in his hand--

Ford swings the pipe connects with Osterman’s head

CUT TO

EXT TIP OF SKY GOD PEAK - SUNSET
Osterman’s eyes slowly crack open
The world is white He can’t make out any details

As his eyes begin to adjust Osterman realizes that he’s at
the tip of Sky God Peak surrounded on all sides by a large
patch of snow that hasn’t yet melted in the Spring sun

FORD
April like this right

Ford stands behind Osterman Luger in hand

Osterman gets a good look at his situation He’s basically
hog-tied His hands and legs are bound together behind his
back He kneels awkwardly on the snow

He tries to wriggle a bit but he’s tied tight
No chance for escape
Paralyzed

Ford presses the barrel of the Luger against the back of
Osterman’s neck

Right against THE BULLETHOLE SCAR

FORD

Near the end of the War The
liberation of Dachau

(a moment)
First thing we noticed was the
smell That’s what got our
attention

(another )
Like my father’s taxidermy shed

For the first time Osterman is at a loss for words
Just listening
FORD (CONTD)
When we got to the camp saw
boxcars sitting out on the tracks
Looked like they were filled with
old clothes

Ford’s hand starts to quiver almost microscopically

FORD (CONT’D)
Got a little closer you could make
out the bony hands and legs Some
faces Not faces Just skin
stretched over skulls Eyeballs
popping out

The sun starts to dip below the horizon

FORD (CONT’D)

Id been shooting at Germans for
two years They’d been shooting at
me But I didn’t hate them The
idea of hating them never entered
my brain until I saw Dachau

(back to the story)
A dozen SS guards surrendered
They were gonna be shipped back to
a POW camp for a few weeks Then
after the war they’d all go home

(a moment)
Sergeant decided we oughta do
something So he volunteered us
to transport the prisoners back to
the rear for processing

By this time Ford has let the gun drift to his side

FORD (CONTD)
Stripped them down took off their
shoes burned their uniforms
marched them up a hill in the
middle of nowhere

Ford looks around a hint of recognition in his face--

Sky God Peak must bear more than a passing resemblance to
that hill back in Germany

FORD (CONTD)
When we made it to the top we
lined them up on their knees
facing away from us This young
guy never saw his face he was
mine

Osterman reacts subtly

FORD (CONTD)
And I was ready to do it too But
I started hearing the shots down
the line bodies going limp one
right after the other

(MORE )

FORD(contd)
Like a factory you know an
assembly line And I couldn’t I
just-- I couldn’t--
(a moment)
I didn’t kill you I wasn’t trying
to kill you Understand

Osterman doesn’t

FORD (CONTD)
My rifle The Springfield You
can use it to fire grenades But
to do that you gotta replace the
live rounds with blanks

Osterman’s face changes

He looks weaker softer more vulnerable than weve ever seen
him before

FORD (CONT’D)
If I didn’t do it someone else
would So when I caught the
Sergeant looking the other way I
loaded the blanks When he turned
back I had the barrel against the
back of your neck

Ford brings his pistol back up
Wraps his finger back around the trigger

FORD (CONT’D)

And I pulled the trigger I
thought it’d just knock you out
But the muzzle blast must’ve
damaged your spine

(beat)
I’m not gonna apologize but I
didn’t mean for that to happen

Osterman keeps his eyes fixed on the horizon
Silence until his emotions start to bubble to the surface--
OSTERMAN
(softly)
You should have killed me
FORD

I can’t kill like that You can
I can’t

OSTERMAN
(with growing intensity)
Yes yes you can if I can then
you can I know you can anyone
can
(almost to himself)
Can’t they

Tears start to well up in Osterman’s eyes

OSTERMAN
Oh God please Just pull the
trigger You have to You should
have done it then Now you can
finish it

Ford tightens his grip on the pistol
OSTERMAN
Don’t you know the things I have

done Don’t I deserve to die

Ford presses the barrel back against Osterman’s neck

OSTERMAN
He’s nothing but meat and
flesh and tendon Put him out

of his misery

Osterman’s making a pretty good case -- Ford wraps his finger
against the trigger

OSTERMAN
Please God PULL THE TRIGGER

The gunshot echoes
»-mountain to mountain
--e-hill to hill
-ethrough the valley
And Osterman is still alive
BANG BANG

Osterman twists his head around sees Ford unloading the
remaining bullets into the snow

BANG CLICK -- CLICK -- CLICK --

Ford tosses the empty Luger away He pulls a knife from his
belt and CUTS the main rope restraining Osterman

Osterman waits there for a bit composing himself Then he
shuffles over to a nearby rock sits down starts to slowly
remove the rest of the bindings from his hands and feet

His eyes remained fixed on the ground
Ford steps to another rock sits down
Neither of the men say a word
Until

FORD

(exhausted)
So this old Italian guy goes to
the village priest He hasn’t
confessed in years and he wants to
get right with God He says
“Father back during the War this
beautiful woman came to my door and
asked me to protect her from the
enemy So I hid her up in the
attic”

By now Osterman has loosened about half of his bindings

And on the nearby rock Ford starts to wipe off the
camouflage grease that still covers his body and face

FORD (CONTD)
The priest says “That’s a
wonderful thing you did no need to
confess” “But it’s worse
Father” the old guy says “the
girl started to repay me with
sexual favors like blowjobs shit
like that”

Ford continues to clean his face Osterman continues to
loosen his bindings

FORD (CONT’D)
“Well you were both in great
danger” the priest says “and war
makes sinners of us all You are

forgiven my son” “Thank you
Father” the old man says “but I
have one more question” “And what

is that my son”

Ford has removed the grease from his face Osterman has
freed himself from his bindings

FORD (CONTD)
(finally delivering the
punchline)
“Should I tell her the war’s over”

Either because the punchline is lost in translation or
because it isn’t exactly the world’s funniest joke it
takes Osterman a few moments to react
But then--
Osterman cracks a half-smile starts to chuckle

Ford also begins to laugh

But they’re not laughing in amusement or joy They’re
laughing because there is literally nothing else they can do

They can only laugh

These men hate each other For good reason No question
about it But we’ll sense that beyond that hatred is a
recognition deep down that they may be the only two people
who can truly understand one another

After a moment

The laughter dies down leaving Ford and Osterman alone with
nothing but the mountains the trees and the wind as company

FADE TO BLACK
