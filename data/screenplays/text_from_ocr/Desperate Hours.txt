OVER BLACK

The sound of HOWLING WIND builds with MUSIC growing louder
and louder as the following words appear

AUTUMN 1918

The deadliest year in American history is drawing to a close
At home more than 675000 people have died from Spanish
Influenza a devastating plague that will ultimately claim
more than 50 million lives around the world

These words fade Replaced by

In Europe soldiers fighting in the brutal trenches of World
War I have perished at a rate unrivaled in modern warfare
Those fortunate enough to see Armistice Day have started to
come homeonly to discover their communities in ruin
These words fade Replaced by

The nation is in mourning more people have died in the past
twelve months than in all American wars combined In many
parts of the country schools and churches remain closed and
public gatherings even funerals are strictly prohibited
These words fade Replaced by

It is a dark terrible timefor everyone

The wind and music continue to build Finally they crescendo
together like the cries of ghosts in agony--

CUT TO

EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- DAWN

And then -- suddenly -- everything is quiet and peaceful

The sun rises over a distant ridge revealing a lonely RANCH
nestled in the valley far below

This place feels safe and remote a tiny island in an ocean
of green far away from the horrors of the world

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

FRANK SULLIVAN wakes up and slowly climbs out of bed He
struggles at first stiff and sore Once a rugged cowboy
Frank is now approaching middle-age in the 20th century a
man used up and no longer relevant

But there is power in him yet A lifetime of farming has
left his body in better shape than most men half his age

Frank makes his way through the quiet house sad and lonely--

PICTURES of his FAMILY (wife daughter and son) decorate every
room and line every hallway But they are nowhere to be seen

Frank Sullivan is all alone

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MORNING

Frank brews a pot of coffee and fixes some breakfast
listening to the silence as it weighs heavy all around

In a nearby window a GOLD STAR BANNER shines brightly in the
morning sun a timeless symbol of sacrifice and loss

In addition two BLACK SILK CREPES hang over the front door
letting us know death has visited this house recently

And on more than one occasion

EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- LATE MORNING

Frank is hard at work repairing a broken fence Each hammer
strike echoes and fades the only sound for miles

Frank suddenly hears a distant rumbling He slowly looks up--

A MODEL-T FORD appears over the hill bouncing along at ten
miles an hour Frank squints recognizing the driver--

FRANK
For Gods sake

The car pulls over and comes to a stop TOM DONOVAN (40s)
climbs out wearing a sheriff’s uniform--

TOM
Heya Frank

FRANK
Finally bought one huh

TOM
Nah belongs to the city Being
mayor has its perks You should
come into town more often They
outnumber horses now

FRANK
That’s not something I care to see
(Then noticing)
What’s with the uniform

Tom glances at his shirt as he pops the trunk of his car
TOM
Oh yeahguess you wouldn’t have
heard I took over for Bill Stevens
after he passed

FRANK
You’re the sheriff now

TOM
Just until they find a replacement

FRANK
I didn’t realize it was legal to
hold two public offices

TOM
It probably isn’t

Tom bends over and lifts out a large BIRTHDAY PRESENT--

FRANK
What the hell is that

TOM
Think I’d forget

FRANK
Think I need a reminder

TOM
You know a simple ‘thank you’
would do This isn’t the easiest
place to get to

Frank nods and reluctantly takes the package--

FRANK
It’s heavy

TOM
Yeah it’s a nice gift Frank

Tom shuts the trunk and turns to face his friend BEAT

FRANK
You drove all the way up here just
to give me this

TOM
Seemed like a good time to stop by
see how you’re doing

FRANK
And how am I doing
TOM
I don’t know You tell me

Frank hesitates not sure what to say
FRANK
You wanna cup of coffee before
heading back
TOM
(a moment then)

Sure that’d be great

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank sets the birthday present down on the kitchen counter
and starts to brew another pot of COFFEE

Tom stands nearby his eyes quietly roaming--

He sees the GOLD STAR BANNER hanging in the window And two
black SILK CREPES draped across the front door

And then Tom notices a MILITARY SWORD mounted in a glass
case sheathed and locked awayfrom an era long ago--

TOM
‘Get that in Cuba

Frank looks up as he pours some coffee Finally he nods--

TOM (CONT’D)
‘Thought so You ever hear from any
of the old guys

Frank shakes his head as he walks across the room

TOM (CONT’D)
Me neither Too bad I hear
Roosevelt’s not doing well
(Takes the coffee)
Thanks

Tom takes a sip and nearly spits it out--

TOM (CONT’D)
God that’s awful

FRANK
I know I don’t make it as good as
Emily used to

Tom hesitates then takes another sipthis time without
complaint He nods at the birthday present--
TOM
C’mon open it

Frank takes a deep breath and tears away the wrapping paper
revealing a brand new VICTROLA PHONOGRAPH--

TOM (CONT’D)
You seen these things Everyone’s
got ‘em Here let me show you

Tom places a RECORD on the wheel and lowers the needle
Softly suddenly-- MUSIC FILLS THE HOUSE

It floats down empty hallways and creeps into vacant rooms
hanging gently in the air beside pictures and portraits of
people who have left never to return

Frank’s eyes well with emotion--

FRANK
Emily and I used to dance to this

TOM
I know Thought you’d like it
Got ya some others too

Tom hands over a collection of RECORDS Frank shuffles
through the titles stopping at one in particular--

AFTER YOUVE GONE by Marion Harris

Frank stares at the record suddenly overwhelmed He looks up
at his friend and finally says--

FRANK
Thank you Tom

Tom slowly nods as the song comes to an end He carefully
lifts the needle and silence fills the room

FRANK (CONTD)
What’s new in town

TOM
You mean besides the horseless
carriage A lot actually Most of
the construction that was going on
before the flu hit started up
again Think the car’s impressive
You should see some of these
buildings that are going up The
world’s changing before our very
eyes I still can’t believe it
FRANK
‘Quarantine lifted

TOM
Yeah couple months ago Stores are
back in business Church is in
session Even re-opened the school
(Off Frank’s look)
Rosaleigh’s teaching class until
they find a replacement

FRANK
It’s always amazing to see how
quickly people move on

TOM
Nobody’s forgotten Emily Frank
The kids tell Rosaleigh everyday
how much they miss her

Frank slowly nods then finds the courage to ask--

FRANK
How’s the rest of your family

TOM

(Hesitates)
Theyre fine Everyones fine I
was about scared to death when
Rosaleigh got sick butshe
pulled through ‘Seems to be
getting stronger everyday And
Edward’s due in on Sunday

FRANK
(a moment then)
That’s great Tom Really

TOM
Eh we got lucky I’m just glad the
troubles are over

FRANK
It’s what we were all praying for

TOM
Yeah

Tom glances at the GOLD STAR BANNER hanging in the window
And the SILK CREPES draped across the front door

TOM (CONTD)
it’s just too bad it couldn’t
have happened a little sooner
EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- LATER

Frank walks Tom back to his Model-T Ford A cold wind blows
through the valley Tom winces Frank does not

TOM
You knowwe’re having a little
celebration tonight Dancing
Fireworks Should be a good time
No flu masks allowed
(Beat)
You should come

Frank glances up at the cloud-riddled sky--

FRANK
You may be in for some rough
weather

TOM

Yeah wellrain or shine folks
would still love to see ya

(Off Frank’s look)
C’mon no one should be alone on
their birthday

FRANK
I’m not much good around people
these days Tom

TOM
(Disappointed)
Alright It’s an open invitation
in case you change your mind

Frank watches his friend climb back into his car
FRANK
Tell Rosaleigh I said thank you for
the thoughtful gift
TOM
Tell her yourself She’ll be there
tonight Just think about it okay

Frank hesitates then finally nods Tom starts the engine
puts his car in gearand slowly drives away

EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- LATER

The wind blows rattling branches like skeleton bones

Frank is back at work torquing a hammer to remove a set of
rusty nailsthe hammers shaft suddenly snaps
Frank falls to the ground with a dull thud He sits up dusts
himself offand stares down at his broken tool

EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- STABLE -- LATER

Frank pulls open the door and steps inside A torrent of
excited rustling erupts in the stall up ahead

Frank grabs a SADDLE and walks over to his HORSE its tail
swishes back and forth in hopeful anticipation

FRANK
Hey Fella

Frank strokes the animal’s mane wondering aloud--
FRANK (CONTD)
What do you say Should we go see
what’s new in town

The horse’s dark milky eyes give him the answer--

EXT OPEN RANGE -- LATER

Frank soars across the empty landscape an expert rider
comfortable being a spec in God’s country

But then suddenly he brings his horse to a stop--

The wind blows carrying sounds of a modern town just beyond
the ridge Frank hesitates intimidated

He slowly rides over the hill revealing--

EXT MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

A world transformed by asphalt and steel Buildings are
reaching skyward automobiles outnumber horses

Frank takes it all in as he makes his way into town His
horse sidesteps awkwardly weaving between cars

INT SALOON -- CONTINUOUS

PATRONS fill a modern bar wearing faded jeans and cotton
shirts as well as a few lingering FLU MASKS

CHARLIE FOSTER and BEN SANDERFORD (40s both “regulars”) look
up as Frank passes by their window

CHARLIE
You see that

Ben shrugs dumbfounded Couldnt becould it
EXT TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

ELI PETERSON (60s) sits at his desk quietly working
Something outside suddenly catches his eye

Eli sets down his pen and goes to the window His eyes fill
with stoic pain as he watches Frank ride into town

INT SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- CONTINUOUS

ROSALEIGH DONOVAN (40s Toms wife) stands before THIRTY
STUDENTS writing a lesson on the CHALKBOARD

From the corner of her eye Rosaliegh sees Frank’s reflection
in the window The chalk in her hands suddenly breaks

STUDENT
Mrs Donovan Are you alright

Rosaleigh walks across the room as if floating on eggshells
She peers quietly out the window And then--

STUDENT (CONTD)
Look It’s Mrs Sullivan’s husband

The entire class rushes to the window--

EXT SHERIFF’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

NATHAN MILLER (18 town deputy) comes walking down the street
with a brand new BOOK tucked under his arm

PATRICK BONNER (32 town deputy) waits outside the sheriff’s
office He sees his partner approaching and nods--

PATRICK
What ya got there

Nathan smiles and holds up the FRONT COVER-- ATTACK OF THE
RED BARON THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES

PATRICK (CONTD)
God not another one How many of
those stupid things ya gonna buy

NATHAN
I dunno I was too young for the
draft Sounds pretty exciting

Nathan starts flipping through the pages Suddenly Patrick
gives him an urgent nudge The young deputy looks up--

Frank Sullivan rides by on his horse The two deputies stare
dumbfounded Then suddenly they hear a voice from behind--

TOM (0OS)
What the hell’s going on out here

Patrick and Nathan both turn to face Tom Donovan BEAT

NATHAN
Hey Sheriffor do you still want
us to call you ‘Mr Mayor’

TOM

Hell Nathan I don’t know You ask
me that every day Just call me
Boss alright

(Confused)

What’s everyone looking at

(Then seeing Frank)

Well shit That didn’t take long

INT LEONARD DUSCHENE’S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME

LEONARD DUSCHENE stands in the gloomy shadows of his
tiny bedroom a haunted man living in exile--

He watches Frank stop just outside the SUNDRY STORE

EXT SUNDRY STORE -- SAME TIME

Frank glances briefly at a SILK CREPE hanging in the window
then opens the door and steps cautiously inside--

INT SUNDRY STORE -- MOMENTS LATER

PROPAGANDA POSTERS still hang on the wall looming above
stacks of RED BARON NOVELS trumpeting the glory of war

Frank ignores them as he heads down the aisle He grabs a new
HAMMER off the shelf and walks over to the counter

KAY ANDERSON (40s store owner) watches Frank approach She
smiles sadly through warm gentle eyes--

KAY
Will that be everything Frank

FRANK
Hello Kaygot a newspaper that’s
current

Kay nods and slides one across the counter Frank glances at
the BOLD HEADLINE-- ARMISTICE DECLARED PEACE AT LAST

KAY
‘Guess I don’t have to ask if you
want to buy war bonds huh

Frank slowly shakes his head Kay rings up his total--

KAY (CONT’D)
That’1ll be sixty-seven cents

Frank hands her a DOLLAR BILL and waits for change

FRANK
You running the store now

KAY
Yeah since Daniel passed It’s
been hard But Spencer’s coming
home soon So at least I have that
to look forward to
(Then changing subjects)
‘Coming to the celebration tonight

FRANK
Nodon’t think so

KAY
Oh that’s a shame
(As she bags his things)
May be best though They’re saying
a big storm’s heading our way

Frank smiles politely and reaches for the bag Kay suddenly
tightens her grip refusing to let go--

KAY (CONTD)
I’m sorry about your boy Your wife
and daughter too It just ain’t
fairwhat happened to you

Frank slowly nods then backs away and reaches for the door
He glances out the window and suddenly stops--

SUE FOWLER is outside walking down the street

EXT MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

She’s a vision of grace and loveliness greeting everyone
with a smile as she makes her way through town

Sue Fowler has no idea that she’s being followed

Twenty yards back across the street Frank Sullivan walks --
his footsteps in line with hers -- watching her every move

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- LATER

Sue Fowler now dressed in a WHITE DOCTOR’S COAT comes out
of the examination room with REVEREND MORGAN FARLEY (50s)--

SUE
I wouldn’t worry about it Morgan
Should clear up in a week or two

REVEREND FARLEY
Thanks Sue I can always count on
you to put my mind at ease

SUE
It’s not the flu

REVEREND FARLEY
God what a relief

They turn a corner and suddenly stop dead in their tracks
shocked to see Frank Sullivan standing near the door--

SUE
FrankI didn’t hear you come in
Have you been here long

FRANK
Not really
(To Reverend Farley)
How are you Morgan

REVEREND FARLEY
I’m well Frank And you

Frank hesitates then shrugs Farley steps closer--

REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
I don’t believe we’ve seen each
other since your wife and daughter
passed FrankI am so sorry If
there’s anything I can do--

FRANK
There isn’tbut thank you

Reverend Farley hesitates then turns back to Sue--

REVEREND FARLEY
I’1ll see you on Sunday then

SUE
(Nods )
Bye Morgan

Reverend Farley tips his hat and leaves The door closes
softly behind him Frank and Sue are alone BEAT

SUE (CONT’D)
What are you doing here

FRANK
I was in town Thought I’d stop by
SUE
(a moment then)

It’s good to see you

EXT MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

Reverend Farley comes outside and walks down the street He
sees Tom Donovan up ahead and goes over to meet him--

REVEREND FARLEY
You’re never gonna believe who I
just saw in Sue Fowler’s office

TOM
Frank Sullivan
(Off Farley’s look)
‘Saw him ride in

REVEREND FARLEY
I can’t even imagine
(Looks up at Sue’s window)
--he lost everyone

Tom slowly nods then glances down the street where a LARGE
BANNER is being hung above the TOWN’S ENTRANCE

REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
How’s the new job treating you

TOM
Eh fair enough I just hope things
stay quiet

REVEREND FARLEY
I’m sure they will Tom After
everything we’ve been through
(Beat)
What could possibly happen now

Tom turns and gives Farley a look don’t tempt fate

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- EXAMINATION ROOM -- LATER

Frank sits on a table with his shirt unbuttoned Sue warms
her STETHOSCOPE and places it over his chest

This office like everything else in town reflects a world
in transition the old giving way to the new

X-RAYS and MICROSCOPES VACCINES and ASPIRIN BOTTLESall
mingle with crude instruments from an earlier time

SUE
Take a deep breath
(Frank inhalesexhales)
How have you been feeling

FRANK
Fine I guess

SUE
Any symptoms I should be worried
about Fever Headaches

Frank slowly shakes his head as Sue listens to his heartbeat
their faces just inches apart Sue suddenly pulls away--

SUE (CONT’D)
Roll up your sleeve please

Frank tugs at the arm of his shirt Sue wraps a BLOOD
PRESSURE CUFF around his bicep

FRANK
‘Hear your nephew’s coming home

SUE
My sister tell you that

FRANK
Yeah just saw her

Sue squeezes the pump tightening around Frank’s arm

SUE

You know I was pretty heartbroken
when George and I realized we
couldn’t have children But
watching all those mothers send
their boys off to warI don’t
knowmade me feel like maybe it
was a blessing in disguise

(Then off Frank’s look)
I’m happy for her She could use a
little joy We all could

Sue checks the redial and unfastens the cuff--

SUE (CONTD)
Congratulations you’re in better
shape than most teenagers

FRANK
I bet you say that to all your
patients

Sue smiles and begins to put her things away

SUE
Are you worried about anything in
particular Frank

Frank shrugs something clearly on his mind Sue glances at
the WEDDING BAND on his right ring finger--

SUE (CONTD)
How long has it been

FRANK
(a moment then)
Almost a year

Sue steps forward choosing her words carefully--

SUE
I know it’s natural to worry when
people you’ve lived with get sick
but if you’re not showing any
symptoms by now then

FRANK
I’m in the clear

SUE
In a manner of speaking

Frank slowly nods BEAT

FRANK
Have there been any recent cases

SUE
Not for awhile Things are getting
back to normal Sore throats
Broken bones That sort of thing

FRANK
Think you’ll stay on

SUE
I honestly don’t know We’ll see
what happens when the boys come
home It’s one thing for a nurse to
take over when all the male doctors
have been drafted Or killed But
making it permanent is something
else entirely

Frank glances across the room where a portrait of the town’s
late PHYSICIAN (60s) still hangs on the wall BEAT

FRANK
You should stay People know you
trust youyou’re good at it

SUE
Thank you Frank

They sit together in silence and the tension quickly returns
Suddenly the sound of distant SINGING fills the air

Frank and Sue stand up and go to the window--

A group of CIVIL WAR VETERANS (all 70s) are standing outside
singing WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME

Written by a different generation fighting a different war
the lyrics seem as timely as ever These dying veterans --
their voices old but resolute -- bear witness to the most
universal of truths Dwell on the past and youll lose an
eye Forget the past and youll lose both

SUE (CONT’D)
I remember when you left with
President Roosevelt all those years
ago We sang the same song then
Weve really been through a lot
haven’t we An epidemic and a war
--all in the same year

FRANK
It’s the way it’s always been

Frank stares out the window and sees Eli Peterson on the
street Once again we sense the two men have history

FRANK (CONTD)
When I was in the Philippines we
lost six men to measles for every
one we lost in combat Soldiers
sleep in close quarters They board
trains They travel all over the
world If you want to spread a
diseaseall you need is a war

Frank notices the LARGE BANNER being hung at the edge of
town Then he shifts his glance to a familiar building--

FRANK (CONTD)
How’s Leonard doing

SUE
He stays in his room most days And
that seems to suit people just
fine They’re still pretty angry

FRANK
It wasn’t his fault

SUE
I know But it’s always easier when
there’s someone to blame I feel
sorry for himhe’s got nobody

Frank glances at Sue then stares back out the window BEAT

SUE (CONTD)
Is it lonesome living all by
yourself I don’t mean to pry it’s
justI imagine the solitude would
be pretty hard to bear

FRANK
It’s not so badonce you get used
to the feeling

SUE
You don’t live so far away I could
cook you a meal sometime if you’re
inclined to accept an invitation

FRANK
George okay with that

SUE
(Hesitates)
He’d love to have you

Frank smiles knowing that’s not true He glances out the
window once more then cautiously steps back--

FRANK
I should go

SUE
It was good to see you Don’t wait
so long next time

Frank smiles then steps forward and gives Sue a gentle hug
goodbye She suddenly winces in pain

Frank hesitates then pulls at her necklinerevealing a
mottling grey bruise just beneath her shoulder blade

FRANK
Goddamnit

SUE
Frank please

FRANK
I thought he quit that

Sue pulls away and covers herself

SUE
He didn’t know he was hurting me
alright He started drinking again
when his brother died
(then off Frank’s look)
You’re not the only one who’s lost
someone you know

FRANK
Sue

SUE
Frank it’s none of your business
Just let it be
She steps back folds her armsand finally looks at him

SUE (CONTD)
Will there be anything else

FRANK
No I guess not

Frank slowly turns and heads for the door Sue watches him
wishing he wouldn’t leave like this--

SUE
Frank

Frank stops and looks back at her Sue hesitates then says--

SUE (CONTD)
Happy Birthday

Frank smiles softly Then turnsand leaves

EXT MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank climbs back on his horse just as the LARGE BANNER is
unfurled above the town’s entrance--

Its a triumphant declaration heralding the end of war as
well as the heroic return of the towns soldier sons

Frank stares at it for a moment And then suddenly he
realizes everyone is watching him

Frank takes a final look at the singing veterans Then Eli
Peterson And then finally his friend Tom Donovan

Frank kicks his horse swiftly and gallops away passing
beneath the banner as he rides out of town

EXT CEMETERY -- LATER

Frank comes to a beautiful clearing and tethers his horse to
a nearby tree The wind blows cold and ominous--

Frank takes a deep breath summoning his courage He places a
handkerchief over his faceand enters the town cemetery--

And now we get a glimpse of the true horror of influenza
freshly dug GRAVES and unburied CASKETS stacked row upon row

HEADSTONES mark the remains of young and old rich and poor
all dying in the dreaded plague year of 1918

Frank makes his way through this awful place finally
stopping at the graves of his wife and daughter

He stares at his family -- helpless and alone

EXT MEADOW -- EVENING

Dozens of MODEL-T FORDS park along the meadow’s edge their
bright headlights piercing the dusty haze of twilight

TOWNSPEOPLE welcome each other as the BAND starts to play and
MUSIC fills the air Everyone claps and cheers

It’s going to be an eventful evening

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- SAME TIME

Frank sits in the dark shadows of his lonely house listening
to Marion Harris sing AFTER YOUVE GONE on the phonograph--

Now wont you listen honey while I say How could you tell
me that youre going away Dont say that we must part
Dont break your babys heart

As the song continues Frank takes a pair of SCISSORS and
clips the front page of the newspaper he bought earlier

The flickering light of a nearby candle dances in his eyes
Frank stares at a headline that seems to taunt him--

ARMISTICE DECLARED PEACE AT LAST
Frank glances at the GOLD STAR And the song continues--
After youve goneand left me crying After youve gone

theres no denying Youll feel blue youll feel sad
Youll miss the dearest pal youve ever had--

Overwhelmed Frank lifts the needle and the song abruptly
stops The house grows deathly quiet But then--

A crack of THUNDER suddenly rumbles overhead And the autumn
wind carries the faint sound of distant celebration

Frank Sullivan stands up and goes to the window BEAT

EXT MEADOW -- EVENING

The party is in full swing The band plays to the sunset as
rows of dancing couples welcome the night--

Nearby a group of men prepare some FIREWORKS waiting for
darkness so they can rocket them into the sky

As the music pools with laughter and joy a few TOWNSPEOPLE
notice the approaching sound of GALLOPING HORSE HOOVES

Heads turn as they draw near Then suddenly--

Frank Sullivan appears over the ridge riding towards them
his reluctance visible even from a distance

TOWNSPEOPLE gasp a few nudge each other and point

Frank tethers his horse to a tree at the end of a long line
of MODEL-T FORDS The animal snorts with disgust--

FRANK
Don’t worry I won’t be long

Frank turns and approaches the crowd TOWNSPEOPLE come over
to say ‘hello’ Frank smiles shaking everybody’s hand

Sue Fowler watches from a distance--

She’s dressed for the occasion and looks even lovelier than
before A little makeup has put a spotlight on her face

Frank Sullivan notices her right away

Sues breathing grows heavy as he approaches her body
language a curious mixture of excitement and fear

She waits for him to reach herand then finally says--

SUE
I’m glad you came

FRANK
Yeah well
(Looks around)
It is my birthday after all

Sue smiles as the world celebrates around them The last
vestiges of twilight fade and the sky grows very dark

But neither Sue nor Frank notice They’re lost in each other
ACROSS THE MEADOW
Rosaleigh grabs Tom by the arm nodding at Frank and Sue--

ROSALEIGH
Would you look at that
(Tom follows her gaze)
I wonder how much shorter George’s
leash will get now that Emily
Sullivan is dead and buried

Tom glances at his wife with mild disappoval And then
Rosaleigh shifts her glanceand suddenly freezes--

Leonard Duschene is walking along the meadows edge
ROSALEIGH (CONT’D)
I don’t see how he can even show
his faceafter all the misery he
brought on this town Aren’t they
supposed to hang traitors
Tom stares at Leonardand slowly nods
ACROSS THE MEADOW

Frank and Sue continue to talk--

FRANK
That’s quite a dress

SUE
Oh I’ve had it for years

FRANK
Looks brand new

SUE
I don’t get to wear it that often
-do you like it

FRANK
(a moment then)
Very much

Frank glances at the dancing couples then looks back at Sue
We can see in his eyes what he’d like to ask her

And we can tell by hers that she’s dying to say yes

But Frank is torn both by loyalty and concern over what
people might think He fidgets nervously with the wedding
ring on his fingerand hesitates a moment too long--

GEORGE (0S)
Well look who it is

GEORGE FOWLER steps forward holding a beer in his hand
Frank’s eyes slant to stab wounds Sue tenses on edge

GEORGE (CONT’D)
How are ya Frank

FRANK
Fine George Yourself

GEORGE
Pretty good

Frank clenches his fist and glances at Sue She stares at
him begging with her eyes Not here Not now

FRANK
‘Sorry about Dave

GEORGE
Yeah he deserved better Hell I
suppose we all did
(Glances up at the sky)
Wonder how much longer the
weather’s gonna hold

FRANK
Hopefully they’1ll be able to get
the fireworks off in time

George slowly nods then turns to Sue--

GEORGE
C’monlet’s go over and say ‘hi’
to the Ludlows
(As they leave)
See ya around Frank

Frank watches George and Sue head back into the crowd then
he slowly turnsand sees Tom Donovan standing nearby--

FRANK
That new job of yours come with any
deputies

TOM

Yeah two of ‘em ‘Only men left in
this town under the age of forty

FRANK
You need to take ‘em out and pay
George Fowler a visit
(Off Tom’s look)
He’s drinking again

TOM
Last I checked that’s not against
the law Not yet anyway His
brother died Cut him a break

FRANK
‘Problem is when George Fowler
drinks he gets violent
(Off Tom’s look)
Sue’s got bruises around her
shoulder and collar bone

TOM
Who told you that

FRANK
Saw it with my own eyes

Tom glances across the meadow letting out a deep sigh--

TOM
Shit I was worried about that
There have been rumors

FRANK
Why hasn’t anything been done

TOM
What am I supposed to do

FRANK
I don’t know Sheriff You tell me

TOM
Hey take it easy I’1l look into
it alright

Frank stares at Tom as THUNDER erupts overhead
TOM (CONTD)
Don’t look at me like that I told
you I hate this goddamn job

Tom suddenly turns and disappears back into the crowd Frank
watches him go then heads the other way

As he walks Frank overhears PARENTS asking each other when
their children are coming home from the war

Frank looks away saddened He glances across the meadow
and sees Leonard Duschene standing all by himself--

The two men stare at each other for a momentand then the
sound of MICROPHONE FEEDBACK causes everyone to look up

Tom Donovan and Reverend Farley are standing at the PODIUM--

TOM (CONT’D)
Ladies and Gentlemencould I have
everyone’s attention please

The music and dancing stop All eyes turn to Tom--

TOM (CONTD)
As most of you probably know by
now I’m no good at making
speeches But I wanted to welcome
you all out tonightand just say
thank you for coming

(Applause then)
This is a time for celebration But
we would be remiss if we did not
pause to remember those we’ve lost
this past year So on that note
Id like to turn it over to
Reverend Farley Morgan

Reverend Farley steps forward The mood turns grim--

REVEREND FARLEY
In memory of the fallen I ask that
we observe a moment of silence

Suddenly CHILDREN and TEENAGERS begin roaming through the
crowd holding trays filled with SMALL CANDLES

REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
Members of our Sunday school will
be passing by with candles Please
take one for every family member
you lost this year whether it was
from sicknessor war

TOWNSPEOPLE start taking candles as the children pass by
Every FAMILY takes at least one some even take two

A soft orange glow slowly spreads through the meadow

Frank Sullivan looks up at a YOUNG GIRL standing before him
He takes a deep breath and picks up a candle

Then with his other hand he picks up two more

IN THE CROWD

Eli Peterson watches Frank struggle to hold three candles on
his own With trembling hands Eli sets his candle down

AT THE PODIUM
Reverend Farley lifts a single flame high above his head

The entire town follows his lead Hundreds of flames rise in
the darkness whispering gently in the faint autumn air

Leonard stares at all the candles haunted and guilt-ridden

Everyone observes a moment of silence And then Reverend
Farley takes a deep breathand blows out his flame

Everyone else does likewise The meadow suddenly goes dark

A devastating stillness hangs in the airand then the sound
of SHRIEKING ROCKETS causes everyone to look up--

FIREWORKS explode overhead TOWNSPEOPLE gasp and applaud
their faces fading up and down with the flickering light

Then softly and suddenly--

Distant GUNSHOTS pop in the faraway woods

They reverberate for a moment and quickly die away absorbed
by the loud explosions booming overhead

Frank is the only one who notices He turns and looks out at
the thick dark trees wondering if he heard right

CUT TO

EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- SAME TIME

Frank Sullivan’s ranch sits peacefully in the night

A gust of wind shakes the trees like a torrent of darkness
followed by rumbling thunder and flashes of lightning

The storm warnings subside and the silence returns A calm
soothing moment hangs in the airand then--

A YOUNG WOMAN (20s) stumbles out of the woods her clothes
soaking wet her body drenched in blood

The sight of her should take our breath away She appears
suddenly out of nowhere like a ghost in the darkness

She limps towards Frank Sullivans house

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

The young woman breaks a window and comes inside leaving a
thick trail of blood with every painful step

She searches frantically for medicine and supplies but the
house is very dark And her life is fading fast

She collapses on the floor with a sickening thud unconscious
and near death her blood pooling around her

Outside a violent crack of thunder promises heavy rain

EXT MEADOW -- SAME TIME

Just as the fireworks conclude the DOWNPOUR begins

Everybody runs to their cars but the Model-Ts are trapped
Engines start and wheels spin Nobody is able to get away

except for Frank who walks calmly towards his horse --
kicking and snorting beneath an onslaught of rain

Frank climbs into the saddle and gallops away passing scores
of cars as they fishtail in vain

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

Frank comes inside and takes off his wet coat He lights a
candle and makes his way through the dark house

Suddenly Frank stops He can hear the storm outside louder
than ever He sees the broken window first

-and then he steps in something wet

Frank kneels holding the candle close to the floor His eyes
suddenly widen -- he’s standing in a pool of blood

A burst of LIGHTNING reveals the young girl on the floor
Frank springs to action reacting on pure instinct--

He picks the girl up and sets her down on the kitchen table
knocking everything to the ground in order to make room

He tears off her clothes and finds three bullet wounds two
in the arm one in the thigh Blood pours out of her body

Frank wraps a tourniquet above each wound then finds the
girl’s pulseso faint it’s barely even there

Frank stares at her overwhelmed This is as far as his
knowledge will take him He needs help He needsa doctor

EXT MEADOW -- LATER

Frank gallops through the pouring rain weaving between
trapped cars and foggy headlight beams--

He knocks on windows and waits for them to crack Then he
peers inside hoping to find Sue Fowler

Finally Frank reaches the right car He knocks loudly and
waits The window opensGeorge Fowler peers out--

GEORGE
Frank What the hell

Frank rides around to the other side of the car He knocks on
the windowit immediately rolls down--

SUE
What’s wrong
FRANK
I need your helpa woman’s hurt
SUE
What How
FRANK

Shot Pretty bad C’mon I’1l
explain on the wayplease

Sue nods and opens her door stepping out into the rain

GEORGE
Sue What the hell are you doing

Frank pulls her up onto his horse and they gallop away

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

Frank and Sue come inside both soaking wet

FRANK
I don’t know where she came from
She was here when I got homecan
you help her

Sue rushes to the girl’s side and quickly goes to work--

SUE
She’s lost a lot of blood
(then horrified)
God her pulse is racingit has
to be in the 140s at least Is
there any alcohol in the house
(MORE )

SUE (CONTD)
(Off his look)
I need a disinfectant

FRANK
What kind

SUE
Whatever’s strongest And I need a
knifelike a scalpel

Frank leaves to gather the items Sue grabs a nearby candle
and moves it closer It lights up the girl’s face

Frank comes back just in time for her to say--

SUE (CONTD)
She looks like Kathryn

Frank hesitates then sets two bottles of WHISKEY and a SMALL
KNIFE down on the table--

FRANK
Anything else

SUE
We need to make a splint for her
arm And I need a hemostat

FRANK
A what

SUE
A pair of pliers

Frank glances around the room -- thinking fast He turns a
TABLE on its side and breaks off one of the LEGS

FRANK
Will this work

SUE
(Looks up)
Yes thank you

Sue fashions a splint and wraps the girl’s arm Frank leaves
the room and returns with a pair of PLIERS--

SUE (CONT’D)
Thank you

Sue soaks a towel and cleans the girl’s wounds

SUE (CONT’D)
Do you know your blood type

FRANK

SUE
Hopefully someone in town does

Sue picks up the pliers and douses them with whiskey--

FRANK
Is that clean enough

SUE
It’s gonna have to be

Sue digs into the girl’s thigh Frank watches with steely
resolve as the pliers go deeperand deeper--

FRANK
(Re Bullet)
Can you get it
SUE
It’s up against the femoral artery
If that gets severed she’ll bleed
to death

FRANK
She’s doing that already

Sue nodsand pushes the pliers in just that much deeper
She pulls out a thick BLACK SLUG mangled and disgusting

Frank grabs his rifle and stands guard near the window
after all the killers may still be out there

CUT TO

EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- MORNING

The rain has stopped The sun begins to rise revealing a
beautiful landscape and a majestic morning

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank sits in a chair holding his rifle in his arms He
hears approaching footstepsand slowly looks up

Sue Fowler comes into the room wiping her hands on a bloody
towel She stares at Frank exhausted Then quietly says--

SUE
She’s alive

Frank slowly nods and gets to his feet

SUE (CONT’D)
Her clothes are ruined though Do
you have anythingshe could use

FRANK
(Hesitates)
Emily’s things are still upstairs
Second bedroom closet

SUE
Okay What should I take

FRANK
(a moment then)
Doesn’t matter
Sue slowly nods then hands him a LIST--
SUE (CONT ’D)
Think you could go into town I
need some things from my clinic

Frank nods pocketing the list He holds up his rifle--

FRANK
You know how to use this

Sue hesitates then nods Frank hands her the gun--
FRANK (CONTD)
Safety’s off All you gotta do is
aimand pull the trigger

SUE
Please hurry

Frank turns and charges out the door
CUT TO

EXT MAIN STREET -- LATER

Frank Sullivan gallops into town heading for Sue’s clinic
TOWNSPEOPLE watch alarmed by his urgent pace

CUT TO

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM CLOSET -- SAME TIME

Sue Fowler stands in the quiet room staring respectfully at
clothes that once belonged to Emily Sullivan

She goes through the dresses one at a timefinally
selecting one that seems safe and appropriate

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME

Frank fills a BLACK MEDICAL BAG with supplies

He hears a pair of boots come thunking up the stairs
followed by Tom Donovan’s voice at the door--

TOM
Saw your horse outside You know
for a guy who supposedly doesn’t
like coming into town you sure are
doing it a lot lately

Frank glances at Tom then continues filling the bag

TOM (CONTD)
You aimin’ to rob the place

FRANK
Taking some things out to Sue

TOM
Where is she

FRANK
My ranch

TOM
Oh good That oughta make for some
nice Sunday gossip

FRANK
There was a shooting last night
Tom

TOM

FRANK
Not sure A girl showed up on my
doorstep covered in blood

TOM
You’re serious

FRANK
You think I’d make this up

TOM
Is she from around here

FRANK
Don’t think so

TOM
But she’s alive

FRANK
Last I checked
(Then urgently)
I need you to come with me Now

TOM
Alright let me get my horse

FRANK
Do it quickly

Tom nods and leaves the room Frank grabs the last few things
on Sue’s listand follows close behind

EXT SHERIFF’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Patrick and Nathan come outside and watch Tom climb onto his
horse He rides over to meet them--

PATRICK
What’s going on Boss

TOM
I need you boys to start gathering
a search party

NATHAN
This early It’s Saturday

TOM
You get twelve able-bodied men as
fast as you can and head out to the
Sullivan Ranch You hear
Nathan looks dumbfounded Patrick slowly nods--

PATRICK
Yes sir

Tom kicks his horse and meets Frank in the middle of the
street Together they gallop out of town

INT LEONARD DUSCHENE’S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Leonard watches Frank and Tom disappear over the ridge His
eyes narrow -- sensing trouble in the air

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

Sue lays a BLANKET over the girl’s trembling body She
suddenly hears faint horse hooves approaching fast

She grabs Frank’s rifle and heads for the door

EXT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Sue steps outside just as Frank and Tom appear over the
ridge They bring their horses to a sudden stop--

SUE
Did you get everything

Frank hands her the medical bag Sue opens it and checks--

FRANK
How is she

SUE
Not good

Sue snaps the bag shut and hurries back to the house

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Tom stares at the blood stained floor as Sue inflates a BLOOD
PRESSURE CUFF around the girl’s arm and checks the redial--

SUE
Jesus she’s 70 over 30

TOM
What does that mean

SUE
That she’s hanging by a thread
(Checks the girl’s pulse)
Her heart can’t keep beating like
this It’s gonna give out
(Then to Tom)
You don’t know your blood type by
any chance do you

TOM
There are different kinds
(Off her look)
What does it even matter

SUE

The wrong kind will kill her
That’s why it matters And since
she’s unconscious we have to find
someone who’s O-negative

(Off Tom’s look)
They’re called universal donors
They’re very rareand they can
give blood to anybody

TOM
I’1l ask around town but who would
even know such a thing

FRANK
Soldiers Anyone who’s met with a
draft board knows if they’re able
to transfuse blood

TOM
Transfuse blood We never did
anything like that in Cuba

FRANK
We did in the Philippines

TOM
(Grimly)
Yeah I bet
(Then stepping closer)
I can’t hardly believe it
somebody shot her

SUE
Twice in the arm Once in the leg
TOM
All on the same side too
(To Frank)

What does that tell you

FRANK
She wasn’t running away

TOM
Wasn’t facing ‘em either

Tom suddenly notices the mangled slug sitting on the table

TOM (CONT’D)
(To Frank)
That look like any bullet youve
ever seen

Frank hesitates then slowly shakes his head Tom turns and
crosses the room staring at the broken window--

TOM (CONT’D)
How’d she get all the way out here

FRANK
I don’t know Tom I didn’t have a
chance to ask her

Tom peers out the window and sees Patrick and Nathan in the
distance leading a SEARCH PARTY towards Frank’s property
DUFFY
(Dramatic Beat)

Let’s find out

EXT WOODS -- LATER

The search party charges through the woods TWELVE MEN on
HORSEBACK armed with GUNS and SCENT-SNIFFING DOGS

Frank and Tom lead the group The others are all MEN we might
recognize -- Patrick and Nathan the Civil War Vets etc

They keep pace with the dogs hot on the girl’s trail

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- SAME TIME

Sue kneels at the girl’s bedside attending to her wounds
She suddenly hears a knock at the front door

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Sue opens the door and finds her husband standing on the
porch She recoils slightly then manages to say--

SUE
Youre late The others left

GEORGE
That’s all you have to say to me
Do you have any idea how worried I
was last night I didn’t even know
what had happened until one of
Tom’s deputies knocked on our door
organizing a search party

SUE
(Exhausted)
Please Don’t start

Sue turns and heads back upstairs George quickly follows

EXT WOODS -- SAME TIME

Branches snap as the dogs carve through the trees The men
follow close behind hoping for some sign or clue

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- LATER

Sue resumes her place at the girl’s bedside George comes to
the doorway and watches quietly

GEORGE
So this is the mystery girl huh
Where’d she come from

SUE
We don’t know

GEORGE
Is she going to live

SUE
(a moment then)
Probably not

GEORGE
Yeah wellyou should be used to
that by now

Sue shudders quietly but doesn’t respond George suddenly
notices an empty WHISKEY BOTTLE sitting on the table--

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Any more of that in the house

SUE
(Hesitates)
I think we used it all

George slowly nods then turns and leaves the room

EXT LAKE -- SAME TIME

Frank and Tom emerge from the woods and find themselves at a
MAJESTIC LAKE stretching for miles in every direction

Tom watches their dog sniff along the shoreline--
TOM
Goddamnitit’s as if she just
fell out of the sky
Frank stares at the TALL CLIFFS towering above the lake

TOM (CONT’D)
Cmon let’s go

Tom turns to leave but Frank doesn’t budge--
TOM (CONT’D)
(Confused)

Frank She didn’t walk on water

FRANK
Maybe she came up out of it

Frank spurs his horse forward charging up the STEEP INCLINE
so severe they’re nearly vertical as they ascend

EXT SUMMIT -- CONTINUOUS

Frank and his horse reach the top and level out onto flat
terrain Frank dismounts and takes in his surroundings--

He hears the sound of a HORSE struggling to climb And then
Tom appears his face ashen from the harrowing ascent

TOM
Let’s not do that again

Frank nods up ahead where the road suddenly bends--
FRANK
If you were waiting to ambush
someone where would you be

Tom looks around for a moment then points--

TOM
There

Frank takes position in the grass He stares at the road and
shifts his weightsomething crunches beneath his feet--

Frank picks up ahandful of empty bullet shells

TOM (CONTD)
Jesus Christ

Frank walks over to the cliff’s edge He stares at the
ground looking for somethingand then he finds it--

Faint TIRE TRACKS like a decaying fossil nearly washed away
by the rain leading right over the edge of the cliff

Frank leans over and peers at the water below the sun dances
across the surface like a fortune of golden coins

Beneath the water oscillating between glimmers of sunlight
is a refracted image of a LARGE BLACK OBJECT

TOM (CONTD)
That what I think it is

Frank hesitates then slowly nods--

FRANK
Yeah

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

George sits at Frank’s desk opening drawers He searches
vigorously but doesn’t find what he’s looking for

Instead he discovers a file of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS--

The article Frank saved earlier is at the top of the pile
along with a hand written LETTER worn and well read--

“Dear Mr and Mrs Sullivan I deeply regret to inform you that
your son Private William Sullivan died this afternoon

George skims the letter then flips through the articles
each one detailing the horrors of the past year

George closes the file and puts it away He goes to shut the
drawer but stops when he sees something--

An old PHOTOGRAPH buried beneath a stack of papers

It shows TWENTY YOUNG SOLDIERS standing at the top of a DUSTY
HILL with an AMERICAN FLAG billowing overhead

A LEGENDARY FIGURE stands in the center--

His thick moustache and coke-bottle glasses identify him as
clearly as a caption would President Theodore Roosevelt

And then George sees two familiar faces in the back row
FRANK SULLIVAN and TOM DONOVAN each twenty years old

SUE (0S)
What are you doing

George looks up and finds his wife standing at the door--

SUE (CONTD)
You shouldn’t be going through
Frank’s things

George hands her the photograph--

GEORGE
If you had a picture of yourself
with the President would you hide
it away in a goddamn desk drawer

Sue stares at the picture suddenly overwhelmed

GEORGE (CONTD)
He left you for that war Least he
could do is put it on display
(MORE )

GEORGE (CONTD)
(Beat)
I wonder what else he’s hiding

George stands up and leaves the room as Sue quietly winces
from the pain of old wounds

CUT TO

INT WOODS -- LATE AFTERNOON

WORK HORSES lurch forward pulling tightly against long
CHAINS running beneath the surface of the lake

Frank Tom Nathan Patrick and the other SEARCHERS watch as
the horses move forward one laborous step at a time

Nathan seems excited the others concerned Whatever these
horses are pulling it appears to be quite heavy

And then suddenly--
A bullet-ridden MODEL-T FORD breaks through the surface

The men slowly gather around as the car comes to shore They
peer through the shattered windows recoiling in horror--

Two DEAD MEN are slumped in the front seat their bodies
destroyed by gunfire their faces unrecognizable

TOM
Nathan hand me their wallets

Nathan glances at Tom the excitement gone from his face Do
I really have to Toms dark eyes give him the answer

Nathan takes a deep breath and reaches inside the car His
hand reappears clutching two leather WALLETS

Tom steps forward and flips them both open Each wallet
carries a BADGE The dead men were federal agents

TOM (CONTD)
Shit

EXT MAIN STREET -- LATER

TOWNSPEOPLE stand outside watching with grave concern as two
PINEWOOD COFFINS get stacked outside the FUNERAL HOME

INT TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Eli Peterson looks up as the DOORBELL chimes Deputies
Patrick and Nathan step into the office--

ELI
Gentlemen

PATRICK
How are ya Eli

ELI
Oh just waiting for the telephone
man to get here so I can retire
(Glances out the window)
Youve had a busy day

Patrick nods and hands Eli a slip of paper--

PATRICK
We need to wire this information to
to Kansas City right away

ELI
What’s going on Folks are talking
about some kind of shooting out at
the Sullivan Ranch

PATRICK
We’re not sure but it needs to
stay quiet Let us know the instant
you get a response alright

Eli nods and watches the two deputies leave He looks down
and reads the wirehis eyes suddenly go wide

EXT TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Eli steps into the street completely dazed He watches the
two coffins disappear inside the funeral home

Then he turns and sees TOWNSPEOPLE standing outside
whispering pointingthe fear already taking hold

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- EVENING

Sue stands by the window staring at the photograph Frank’s
young face is enough to knock the wind out of her

EXT SULLIVAN RANCH -- SAME TIME

Frank and Tom sit beneath a jeweled sky their horses kicking
and snorting in the cold evening air

Frank stares at the wallets of the two dead men--
FRANK

(Reading their IDs)
Neither of ‘em made it to thirty

TOM
Too many young people dying these
days That’s for sure

Frank nods sadly and gives the wallets back to Tom BEAT

TOM (CONT’D)
I’1l come back tomorrow and help
you move the girl into town
(Off Frank’s look)
She can’t stay here This place is
the perfect spot for an ambush

Frank looks around for a moment then slowly nods

TOM (CONTD)
Edward will be with me so we can
get his help as well

FRANK
Don’t forget to ask about his blood
type alright

TOM

Sure And I‘1ll have Farley make an
announcement Maybe someone in town
knows Worth a shot

(Beat)
I could have my deputies stay here
tonight Incase whoever did this
decides to come back

Frank stares at the dark forest considering the offer--

FRANK
If someone was going to show up
they would’ve done it by now

TOM
Alright

Tom sees Sue Fowler standing in Frank’s window He nods--

TOM (CONTD)
You should’ve seen her during the
crisis It reminded me of you
quiet honestly Charging with
Roosevelt up San Juan Hill

(Beat)

People were dying all around her
One after another But she just
kept going Fearless

Frank looks up at Sue Tom stares at his friend--

TOM (CONTD)
You ever regret going to the
Philippinesafter Cuba

FRANK
I did what my country asked

TOM
If you had come home she might not
have married George

FRANK
I don’t regret the years I had with
my wife Tom

TOM
No one’s saying you do But you
deserve to be happy So does she
(Glances at Sue then)
Nobody’d hold it against you
Nobody who matters anyway

Tom kicks his horse and gallops away Frank watches his
friend disappear in the darkness

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER

George Fowler sits at the table nervously rubbing his hands
It’s been awhile since he’s had a drink

-and the shakes are starting to set in
FRANK (0S)
It’s getting pretty late You gonna
head home

George looks up at Frank with eyes darker than the room--

GEORGE
If my wife’s staying I’m staying

Frank stares at George His fist clenches again

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- SAME TIME

Sue leans against the wall deep in thought The sound of
faint moaning causes her to suddenly turn around

The young girl is awake Sue rushes to her bedside--

SUE
Hican you hear me What’s your
name Can you tell me It’s alright
if you don’t remember

The girl’s eyes flutter as she fights to stay conscious Her
heart is racing and her nerves are on fire

SUE (CONTD)
Here let me give you something for
the pain

Sue fills a SYRINGE with MORPHINE--

SUE (CONTD)
This is going to sting a little

She pierces the skin The girl suddenly screams and pulls
away causing the needle to break off in her arm

SUE (CONT’D)
Shit
(Yelling)
Frank George
(Top of her lungs)
I NEED HELP UP HERE

FOOTSTEPS come flying up the stairs and race down the hall
Frank bursts into the room with George close behind

SUE (CONT’D)
Hold her down

Frank steps forward and restrains the girl so that Sue can
dig the bloody needle out of her vein

YOUNG GIRL
Noshtfpfffnasthsplease
nough humphGod no

George stares at the girl trying to make sense of her words--

YOUNG GIRL (CONTD)
No pleasesomebodyhelp
(And then screaming)
Getaway You fuck Help me Shit
Motherfucker Goddamnit

The young girl suddenly grabs Frank by the hand bracing
herself against him holding on for dear life

Sue pulls the needle out of the girl’s arm Blood sprays
everywhere soaking the bed sheets The girl screams--

Sue fills another SYRINGE and sticks the exposed arm The
girl moans as narcotic burns through her veins

She slowly lets go of Frank’s handand falls asleep

GEORGE
Jesus where did she come from
(a moment then)
Been awhile since I heard screaming
like thatalmost forgot what it
sounded like

Frank looks down at his empty hand as Sue goes to the window
She suddenly steps back her face frozen in fear--

SUE
Frank There’s somebody outside

EXT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

A SILHOUETTED MAN stands on the front porch

Frank comes out the side door holding a rifle in his arms He
swings around about to pull the trigger--

FRANK
Don’t move

The man freezes then turns slightlyit’s Eli Peterson

FRANK (CONTD)
Jesus Eli

ELI
Didn’t mean to scare

Frank catches his breath and climbs the porch steps The look
on his face says it all What are you doing here

ELI (CONTD)
Folks in town are saying this girl
looks like my granddaughter
(Beat)
Can I see her

Frank stares at Eliand finally nods

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank stands with Eli at the girl’s bedside watching as the
old man stares down in quiet disbelief--

ELI
Quite something isn’t it
(Off Frank’s look)
I know you’re not a religious man
Frankbut it’s hard not see the
hand of providence in this

FRANK
If you say so Eli
(a moment then)
What are people saying in town

ELI
A lot of rumor andspeculation
Folks see pinewood coffins stacked
outside the funeral home and
(Chokes back emotion)
-old feelings rise up

Eli looks at Frank as the fire crackles behind them--

ELI (CONT’D)
I still haven’t forgiven you
(Off Frank’s look)
For not letting me see my daughter
before you put her in the ground

Frank glances at Sue standing quietly near the door BEAT

FRANK
It was all pretty sudden Eli
There wasn’t much time

ELI
It’s almost worse imagining it You
hear about people’s hair turning
white and falling out Their lungs
filling with fluid black like oil
Drowning in open air

FRANK
It’s better you remember them the
way they were I didn’t want you
seeing themlike that

ELI
(a moment then)
What kind of disease spares the
elderly and attacks the young

Frank stares at his father-in-law unable to answer Eli
looks right at Frank and points to the young girl--

ELI (CONT’D)
Franksave her

And with that Eli turns and leaves the room BEAT

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

Frank Sullivan slumps in a leather chair fast asleep

The house is dark and quiet except for the soft whisper of a
tiny candle flame dancing on a nearby table

Suddenly the candle goes outand a thin trail of smoke
floats to the ceiling as the room grows that much darker--

Frank Sullivan suddenly opens his eyes He sees a STRANGE
SHAPE lurking just across the room

A YOUNG WOMAN Standing by the window

Frank slowly gets up and walks towards her The girl lingers
for a moment then spins towards him

It’s his DAUGHTER She looks right at him through hollow
eyes her face rotting with MAGGOTS and WORMS--

KATHRYN SULLIVAN
Father

Frank Sullivan suddenly bolts awake He gasps and falls out
of his chair struggling to catch his breath

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Sue Fowler sleeps peacefully the fading light of a dying
fire dancing softly against her eyelids

Frank covers her with a blanket then crosses the room and
stokes the fire back to life

He glances up at a FAMILY PORTRAIT hanging on the wall then
looks down at the young girl fighting for her life

This is a line in the sand moment for Frank Sullivan--
He was powerless to save his wife and daughter He had no
control over what happened to his son But Frank can save

this girleven if it means risking his life

He takes a deep breath as the fire roars behind him We can
almost see Eli’s command taking hold in his mind Save her

INT CHURCH -- MORNING

Reverend Farley stands behind the PULPIT addressing his
CONGREGATION Less than half the pews are filled

REVEREND FARLEY
Before we begin I’ve been asked to
make an announcement As I’m sure
many of you have heardthere’s a
young girl out at the Sullivan
Ranch who’s been badly hurt

IN THE AUDIENCE

Tom sits beside Rosaleigh watching as many CONGREGANTS
glance at each other suspiciously

REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
She was viciously attacked Friday
nightand is in desperate need of
a blood transfusion Is anyone here
aware of their blood type

People slowly shake their heads Tom watches disappointed

INT TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- SAME TIME

Eli Peterson comes into the office and finds the telegraph
eerily quiet No messages have come through

Eli stares at empty tray clearly alarmed

EXT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

Frank Sullivan stands outside chopping firewood as the
morning sun breaks free of the horizon

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

George Fowler watches Frank from the window He nervously
rubs his hands which have started to tremble

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER

George walks to the girl’s bedroom and peers inside Sue is
swapping out her bandages George clears his throat--

GEORGE
‘Think I’m gonna head into town
You need anything

Sue glances at his trembling hands and shakes her head
George turns and leaves without saying another word

EXT CHURCH -- LATER

Tom and Rosaleigh come outside and overhear Reverend Farley
talking to a FARMER and his WIFE (Both 50s)--

REVEREND FARLEY
--maybe you could ask Joey when he
gets in next week

FARMER
Our Joey’s been through enough We
don’t want him mixed up in this

The farmer and his wife turn and walk away Farley watches
them go then glances at Tom and Rosaleigh--

REVEREND FARLEY
Seems to be the general feeling
I’m afraid

TOM
They’re just scared

REVEREND FARLEY
Bullet-ridden cars and bloody
corpsesnot all fear is
irrational you know
Rosaleigh glances at her husband BEAT

TOM
Yeah I know

A distant TRAIN WHISTLE suddenly shrieks and Rosaleigh pulls
Tom away Farley watches them race towards the station

INT LEONARD DUSCHENE’S ROOM -- THAT MOMENT

Leonard watches Tom and Rosaleigh charge down the street as
another TRAIN WHISTLE blows already getting closer

EXT MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Rosaleigh glances up at Leonard’s window as the train whistle
fades Her face darkens She turns to Tom--

ROSALEIGH
Farley has a point you know
(Nods at Leonard’s window)
A lot of people would still be
alive if we’d just shut our doors
and kept everyone out

Tom glances at his wife but doesn’t respond He sees Eli
Peterson up ahead waving for them to come over

ROSALEIGH (CONTD)
You better know what you’re doing
especially if you’re getting Edward
involved We’re the only family in
this town who hasn’t lost anyone

TOM
You think I’ve forgotten that

ROSALEIGH
Just make sure you don’t

Tom nods “alright” as Eli steps forward to meet them--

TOM
What is it We get a response

ELI

No that’s just it There’s been
nothing No word

(Then off Tom’s look)
We wired to say that we found two
dead federal agentsdon’t you
think that’s the sort of thing that
would get an answer right away

Tom glances at Rosaleigh as another train whistle shrieks--
TOM
I’m sure we’ll hear something soon
Keep me posted okay

Eli reluctantly nods as Tom and Rosaleigh walk away

EXT TRAIN YARD -- SAME TIME

A TRAIN pulls into the station and TWO DOUGHBOYS step onto
the platform A gathering CROWD bursts into APPLAUSE--

walks with a faint limp searching for his parents

TOM (0OS)

Tom and Rosaleigh are standing up ahead They throw their

INT SALOON -- SAME TIME

PATRONS stand at the window watching the celebration

George Fowler suddenly bursts into the saloon Everyone
watches as the BARTENDER (50s) pours his usual drink--

GEORGE
Thanks Sam Leave the bottle

Sam nods and steps aside Charlie Foster and Ben Sanderford
(the two ‘regulars’) stand up and approach--

CHARLIE
Heya George Didn’t see ya come in
yesterday We were getting worried

LAUGHTER ripples through the saloon as Charlie and Ben
surround George two bad angels perched on his shoulder--

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
‘Been out at the Sullivan Ranch
What’s the story

GEORGE
It’s nothing No big deal

BEN
No big deal I hear you guys pulled
a shot-up car out of the lake
(Leans closer)
Who’s in the coffins George

CHARLIE
To hell with the coffins who’s the
girl She sick

GEORGE
No she ain’t sick Just shot to
hell Sue’s taking care of her

George throws back his drink and pours himself another--

GEORGE (CONTD)
You know Frank’s got a picture of
himself with the president

BEN
You mean Roosevelt Sure Frank
charged up San Juan Hill He’s a
genuine piece of American history

CHARLIE
That’s nothing After Cuba most of
the Rough Riders came home But not
Frank He went to the Philippines
and fought the insurgency there

BEN
I guess one war against Spain
wasn’t enough

CHARLIE
Can you imagine Not even Hearsts
papers could spin that war I bet
Frank saw one or two things over
there Yes sir

BEN
It all worked out though Frank got
his war And George got Sue

CHARLIE
Except now Emily Sullivan is dead
And Sue is back at Frank’s house
George looks up at Charlie his eyes wounded and foggy
BEN
Hey Georgeyou gonna tell us

what we want to know or what

George hesitates then pours another drink as more footsteps
approach His eyes suddenly closeand surrender

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER

Sue comes downstairs and fills a PITCHER with water

She notices the PHONOGRAPH on the counter and starts flipping
through recordssuddenly stopping at one in particular--

AFTER YOUVE GONE by Marion Harris

The sound of an opening door causes Sue to look up Frank
comes inside his arms filled with FIREWOOD BEAT

FRANK
George left

SUE
Yeah he had to go into town
(Holds up the record)
I remember this one

Frank sets down the firewood and slowly approaches--

FRANK
Me too

SUE
They played it the night you left
I don’t think I’ve heard it since

Frank smiles then takes the record from her hands and places
it on the wheel He lowers the needle gently--

After a few bursts of static the song begins to play--

Frank finally finds the courage to look at Sue The lyrics
pull them together and they slowly start to dance

FRANK
If I tell you something will you
promise not to think less of me

SUE
Okay

FRANK
The other nightI wanted to dance
with you

(then off her silence)
Did you hear what I said Sue

They spin towards CAMERA Sue’s eyes are closed--
SUE
(Softly)
I heard you

The song winds down and comes to an end replaced once again
by the crisp static of the spinning wheel

Frank and Sue slowly lean in just about to kisswhen
they’re suddenly interrupted by a knock at the door

Frank forces himself to turn away and leave the room

Sue stares at the record spinning on the wheel She slowly
lifts the needleand the house plunges to silence

Sue takes a deep breath and goes to the window--
The Donovan family is standing outside

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

Frank stands with Tom Rosaleigh Edward and Sue a heavy
silence weighing between them

Edward stares at PICTURES hanging on the wall focusing on
Kathryn beautiful in black and white--

EDWARD
(To Frank)
I don’t know if you were ever
aware butI carried quite a
torch for your daughter when we
were in school
(MORE )

EDWARD (CONTD)
I used to tell William that when we
got back I was gonna call on her
He didn’t like that very much

Frank smiles but doesn’t respond Edward turns and limps
across the room Everyone watches Nobody says a word

Edward reaches the counter and opens his bag--

There’s newspaper lying on top of his things Edward takes it
out and sets it aside then reaches deeper into the bag--

He pulls out a WATCH and a few LETTERS then gives them to
Frank as if they meant everything in the world--

EDWARD (CONT’D)
These were his

Frank takes a deep breath clutching his son’s things

EDWARD (CONT’D)

He has a beautiful grave Just
outside of Fromelles It’s about
the nicest spot you could ask for

(a moment then)
He talked about you all the time
Bragged about how his dad got to
the top of San Juan Hill before
Roosevelt did

(Beat)
All he wanted was make you proud

FRANK
I was already proud of him He
didn’t have to go to war for that

Edward slowly nods Sue cautiously steps forward--

SUE
Edward you don’t know your blood
type by any chancedo you

EDWARD
Dad said you were looking for a
donorI’m AB-Positive Sorry

FRANK
(To Tom)
Morgan make the announcement

TOM
Yeah but nobody’s coming forward
And the next batch of soldiers
aren’t due in until next week

EDWARD
O-negative blood is pretty rare
There weren’t many guys in my
regiment who had it
Sue nods clearly disappointed Tom checks his watch--

TOM
We should probably get going

Frank glances at Sue then reluctantly nods

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- LATER

The young girl lies in bed her breathing weak and shallow
Sue Fowler stands nearby quietly packing her things

FRANK (0S)
Ready

Sue looks up and sees Frank standing at the door She nods
then turns and gives the girl another shot of MORPHINE

FRANK (CONTD)
How’s she doing

SUE
Blood pressure’s low Pulse is
high All we can do is keep her
sedatedand hope for the best

Frank stares at Sue reading between the lines--

FRANK
She’s not going to make it is she

SUE
(a moment then)
With the amount of blood she’s lost
and no donors coming forwardit’s
probably just a matter of time

Frank stares at the girl and finally nods BEAT
SUE (CONT’D)
If it’s any consolation I know how
you feel I was looking forward to
saving a patient for a change

Frank glances at the FAMILY PORTRAIT on the wall Suddenly
Sue realizes it’s more than just some patient for him

help That’s all

CHARLIE

Frank turns and walks out the door

EXT MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

SUE
There’s no cause for alarm

KAY

door Sue hesitates then turns and crosses the room

She discovers three BOYS (ages 12-14) standing in the
hallway armed with their fathers’ RIFLES

ELDEST BOY
Mrs Fowlerwe were wondering if
you could use any help tonight
(Off Sue’s confused look)
We could stand guard--

KAY
Oh no you could not

Kay charges forward to confront the startled children--

KAY (CONTD)
Jimmy Rogers Russell Thompson and
Mitchell Stevens What kind of
foolishness is this You all think
because you missed out on one war
you need to rush out for a second
Do your fathers even know their
rifles have gone missing

The boys look down at their shuffling feetguilty Kay
takes the youngest by the hand and turns to face Sue--

KAY (CONTD)

and carries it over to the girl’s bedside

Leonard stares at the young girl as he rolls up his sleeve

Sue wraps a RUBBER BAND around his arm then pierces his skin
with an 18-gauge needle Leonard flinches but stays quiet

BLOOD starts to flow turning the clear tubing red as it
falls into a COLLECTING BOTTLE resting on the floor

SUE (CONTD)
Tell me if you get dizzy

LEONARD

His blood continues to fill the bottle mixing with
COAGULANT rising every second-- 100cc200cc300cc

off the tubing and removes the needle from Leonard’s arm

Leonard slumps in the chair about to faint Patrick and
Nathan step forward and catch him--

Sue then inserts a NEEDLE into the young girl’s arm and
raises the container Blood flows into the girl’s body

Patrick Nathan and Leonard watch silently captivated

The bottle finally empties Sue removes the needle from the
girl’s arm as carefully as if she were defusing a bomb

are to hear that

TOM

REYNOLDS
Sheriff I’m afraid the less you
know the better For your own
safety As well as hers
(Then to Sue)
Is it safe for her to travel Could
she board a train

SUE
I don’t think that’s a good idea
Not for awhile at least

REYNOLDS
Why not I thought you said her
condition was improving

PARKER
You moved her here didn’t you

SUE
That was a few short miles at a
snail’s pace And even then she
had muscle spasms the whole way

Reynolds and Parker stare at Sue with guarded eyes

SUE (CONTD)
She’s dehydrated Her wounds are
still open The slightest exposure
could cause infection to set in
that could kill her

Reynolds checks his watch--

REYNOLDS
The next train’s at noonand she
needs to be on it

SUE
Sir please

REYNOLDS
Listen I understand your concern
but it’s a risk we have to take
This girl has enemies You’ve seen
what they can do As long as she’s
here this town isn’t safe
(To Tom)

sees TOWNSPEOPLE peering out of every window

FRANK

REYNOLDS

A distant TRAIN WHISTLE suddenly shrieks--

REYNOLDS
We should probably be going

Reynolds and Parker tip their hats and turn to leave
FRANK
Will you be taking the remains of
your dead colleagues as well
The agents suddenly stop and turn around BEAT
FRANK (CONTD)
They’re down at the funeral home

‘Better make it quick then

Reynolds scowls at Frank suddenly aggressive--
REYNOLDS
Suppose I told you the answer is
yes We do mind
FRANK
Youd be breaking the law But that
won’t matter much

REYNOLDS
And why’s that

FRANK
You’1l both be dead

Tom stares at Frank in total disbelief BEAT

REYNOLDS
Is that a fact

FRANK
Not yet

Reynolds glances at Parker then turns back to Frank--

REYNOLDS
Alright ID Here you go

Reynolds and Parker reach inside their jacketsand draw
their guns But Frank is ready And he’s lightning fast--

He puts a bullet in Parker’s head and fires two rounds into
Reynold’s chest Their bodies snap backwards and hit the
ground flooding the street with thick arterial spray

Frank glances back at Tom standing in a prison of shock and
fear his gun still resting firmly in its holster--

TOM
My God What have you done

Frank stares at his friend as TOWNSPEOPLE come outside
staring at the carnage in the middle of their street-—-

Then he glances at the school where Rosaleigh Donovan is
struggling to keep her students away from the window

A slight tremor of movement suddenly catches Franks eye--

“Agent Reynolds” is still alive He slithers along the ground
and reaches for his gun

But Frank’s boot comes down hard snapping his wrist--

Reynolds screams in agonizing pain Frank kicks the gun away
and pulls the dying man up by his collar

FRANK
Their names were William Arthurton
and Robert Church
(Beat)
And they were no friends of yours

REYNOLDS
You got me

Reynolds suddenly smiles dark and evil
REYNOLDS (CONTD)
You people have no fucking idea

what’s coming your way

Blood pours out of Reynold’s mouth as the life fades from his
eyes His head rolls back and his body grows still

Frank stares at the corpse for a moment then lets it fall
back into the sticky redness covering the earth

newspaper out of his jacket handing it to Tom--

FRANK

(Off Tom’s look)
Bottom right corner

Tom takes the newspaper and slowly reads--

TOM
Jesus Christ

Tom lets the paper fall to the floor He goes to the window
as Patrick and Nathan rush forward to pick it up--

PATRICK
This is who we’re up against No
wonder it took so long to respond

NATHAN
I don’t understand We wired the
federal authorities

TOM
Just because we sent a wire doesn’t
mean they got it

(Nodding at the newspaper)
People this powerful have
informants everywhere Someone got
our message and tipped ‘em off

We could wire back pretending to
be those men Say it was all a
mistake ‘Got the wrong girl

Get your horse saddled and meet me
outside You’re riding oughta town

PATRICK
Where to

TOM
Kansas City As fast as you can

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Patrick steps away from the window and glances at Nathan who
has a pale white look of envy spread across his face--

NATHAN
Maybe I should go instead My
horse is younger faster

PATRICK
Kansas City is more than a hundred
miles away You ever ridden that
far through the night
(Beat)
You wanted an adventure Looks like
youre going to get one

Patrick turns and walks out the door leaving Nathan to
glance down at the TIN STAR pinned sharply to his vest

CUT TO

EXT MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

Patrick kicks his HORSE and gallops out of town Everyone
watches him disappear over the ridge

--and then they hear a distant TRAIN WHISTLE

Frank and Tom walk towards the station passing scores of
TOWNSPEOPLE frozen where they stand

INT TRAIN STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank and Tom step onto the platform as a distant TRAIN chugs
towards them through blue-grey twilight

Tom slowly exhales His hands are trembling

FRANK
Cold

Tom slowly shakes his head then quietly says--

TOM

It isn’t fair

(Off Frank’s look)
I’ve done everything I was supposed
to do I didn’t ask to be sheriff
and I never went looking for
trouble When you stepped forward
and volunteered for the
Philippines I stood aside My
hands are clean

Frank hesitates then steps closer--

FRANK
Tomnobody from Kansas City is
going to be on this train

TOM
How do you know that

FRANK
(a moment then)
They’1l wait for it to get dark

Tom takes another deep breath steadying his nerves--
TOM
Let’s just hope the conductors

willing to help us

The train’s whistle shrieks as it nears the station Frank
and Tom step forward But then something terrible happens

The train doesnt stop It soars past them with devastating
speed each car a bullet in the air

Frank and Tom watch the train grow small in the distance
this is worse than they could’ve possibly imagined

INT CHURCH -- LATER

The TOWN has gathered for a meeting People scream and shout
fighting for seats Before long it’s standing room only--

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME

Sue Leonard and Nathan stare out the window -- watching as
the entire town shuffles into the church

Sue sees her sister in the crowd then Rosaleigh and Edward
Donovan And finally Eli Peterson not far behind

And then Sue’s eyes suddenly narrow--

George is stumbling down the street He glances up at Sue
briefly then disappears inside the church

NATHAN
I wonder if my wife’s over there
We have a little girl Just turned
six months old

SUE
You can leave if you want Nobody’s
forcing you to stay

NATHAN
(Hesitates)
No it’s my duty to protect you
and that’s what I’m going to do

The door suddenly opens and Frank enters with Tom their
shoulders sagging under a heavy burden--

SUE
No good

Frank shakes his head as Tom goes to the window--

TOM
What’s going on at the church

SUE
They called a town meeting

TOM
My family over there

SUE
Just saw ‘em go in
Tom turns and quickly leaves Frank glances at the girl--

FRANK
How’s she doing

SUE
Fine assuming she doesn’t get
handed over to a lynch mob

Frank looks up at Sue and she begs him with her eyes to go
over and face his critics He turns and leaves the room

INT CHURCH -- SAME TIME

The meeting is underway A RANCHER (30s) has the floor--

RANCHER
Could more of ‘em be coming

RANCHER 2
Oh they’re coming alright Just
as sure as God’s vengeance Frank
Sullivan killed two of their men
That’s not the sort of thing you
get to just walk away from

Ben Sanderford comes down the aisle distributing BLACK and
WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS to different people--

BEN
Went over to the Hall of Records
and got these pictures This is
what we’re up against

TOWNSPEOPLE gasp as they look at the pictures each one a
grisly crime scene with blood-soaked corpses--

BEN (CONT’D)
They have guns that fire thirty
rounds a second And they’re
capable of this

Ben holds up a particularly gruesome photograph Many
TOWNSPEOPLE turn away unable to stomach the macabre

BEN (CONTD)
Now we don’t know who this girl is
or what she’s done But one thing
is certainshe has a past It’s
dark and it’s ugly And it wants
her dead

The photographs get passed up to Reverend Farley He looks at
them quietly as Charlie Foster stands up to speak--

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I don’t like this folks Not one
bit Girl was supposed to testify
at some trial Okay She got
scared Fine I can understand
that Hell we all can But then
she runs away and makes her
problems our own And that’s not
okay I don’t like people who run
away from responsibility It never
ends good Look at Leonard
Duschene He deserted the army and
who paid the price We did Victims
of the plague he was carrying in
his veins Innocent people always
pay the price when cowards abandon
their duty It’s happened before
And it’s happening now

(Beat)

Earlier today I watched two men
die less than a hundred yards from
where my children go to school It
isn’t right It isn’t fair It’s
not our responsibility

TOWNSPEOPLE voice their agreement as Charlie sits down
IN A NEARBY PEW

George Fowler stares at one of the grisly photographs a
terrible rage building inside of him

BACK OF THE ROOM

The door softly opens and Tom Donovan comes inside He sits
down by his family as a WOMAN (40s) stands up to speak--

WOMAN
I don’t want my husband risking his
life for some stranger For all we
know this girl might even deserve
what’s coming to her We’ve already
lost so many people How much can
one town be expected to endure Our
soldiers have already been through
so much terror overseas The last
thing I want is for them to come
home orphans

The woman sits down as soft murmurs begin to ripple through
the church Reverend Farley suddenly looks up

Frank Sullivan is standing at the door
The room grows deathly quiet
Frank looks around about to speak when--

George Fowler suddenly stands up drunk and loud He stares
at Frank his eyes flickering with the promise of violence

Everyone waits anxiously for something to happen And then--
George Fowler turns and storms out of the church

EXT MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

George charges across the street each footstep angrier than
the last his hatred gathering momentum

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Sue Leonard and Nathan look up as the door bursts open
George Fowler comes inside his eyes dark and angry

GEORGE
Id like to speak to my wife

Nathan and Leonard look at Sue She nods it’s okay George
waits for them to leave then charges towards her

GEORGE (CONTD)
What the hell are you doing

SUE
What do you mean

GEORGE
Don’t play dumb with me You know
exactly what I mean

SUE
I’m a doctor This is my job

GEORGE
Your job She is not your patient
The folks out there are And you’re
about to get them all killed

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT

Leonard and Nathan stand in the lobby listening to the muted
sounds of George and Sue arguing upstairs

NATHAN
Should we go up

Leonard hesitates unsure The fighting grows louder

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

George leans closer getting right in Sue’s face--

GEORGE
Why are you doing this Tell me

SUE
Stay away from me

George grabs her by the arm and pulls her close
GEORGE
Tell me why Why are you putting

this town at risk For him

SUE
God you’re drunk

George slaps her face hard Sue screams--

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT

Leonard hears Sue’s cry and sprints up the stairs

Nathan remains frozen where he stands his face torn apart by
anguish and shame He suddenly looks down

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

George hits Sue again this time with a closed fist--
GEORGE
You want to help Frank save this
whore so that you can be his
That’s it isn’t it It’s been your
reason all along
George throws her to the ground about to stomp her

Leonard bursts into the room and grabs George from behind

George stumbles back then drives an elbow into Leonard’s
solar plexus and hurls him across the room

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT

Nathan hears a LOUD CRASH upstairs and suddenly looks away

There’s no such thing as bravery Only varying degrees of
fear And Deputy Nathan is crumbling

He slowly unfastens his TIN STAR and sets it down Then he
goes to the doorand disappears into the night

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

George tears through the room knocking everything to the
ground Sue gets to her feet and charges towards him--

SUE
Get out of here

George grabs her throat and slams her down on the desk--

GEORGE
Did you let his family die So you
and he could be together just like
you wanted To hell with this town
To hell with these people Just as
long Sue gets what she wanted

He hits her again and againeach punch a sickening thud
against her skull brutal and awful--

His knuckles split and start to bleed George grimaces as he
steps away letting his wife’s limp body fall to the floor

He shakes his hand for a moment and catches his breath Then
he steps forwardand approaches the young girl--

She continues to sleep calm and peaceful completely unaware
of the battle raging around her

George stares at her with murder in his eyes

And then as if suddenly realizing the barbarity of what he’s
done George Fowler backs away And quietly leaves the room

INT CHURCH -- SAME TIME

Frank Sullivan stands in a sea of hostility listening to
various TOWNSPEOPLE express their grievances--

MAN
I remember when our boys were
getting drafted you said the war
was wrong that it wasn’t our
fight But now you’re asking us to
risk our lives For someone we
don’t even know Have you lost your
mind She may look like your
daughter but that doesn’t mean
she’s worth saving

(Beat)
(MORE )

MAN (CONTD)
You owe us an explanation You’ve
wagered all our lives on this

Everyone shouts in agreement as the man sits back down Frank
takes a deep breath gathering his thoughts--

FRANK
I’m not sure what to say except
this is our home not some battle-
field halfway across the world

MAN
It’s a fight we didn’t ask for

FRANK
Maybe notbut it’s coming just
the same

MAN

(Emotional)
First it was the sickness Then
the war Now this It’s too much I
tell youtoo much

Frank stares at the man not sure what to say And then he
sees Kay Anderson standing across the room--

KAY

My husband died eight months ago
when the flu spread through town
Two days later I watched my only
son march off to war

(Gathering herself)
And every night since then I’ve
prayed for just one thing That my
boy would come back to mealive

(Beat)
He’s due in next Thursday

Kay stares at Frank for moment then--

KAY (CONTD)
You and my sister did right in
trying to help this girl Nobody
faults you for that It was
Christian charity fine and decent
(Beat)
But when you killed those men
today you invited the devil back
into our town It’s your mistake
not ours And we shouldn’t have to
pay for it I’m begging you
(Beat)
Let this cup pass from us
Kay slowly sits down Frank turns to face everyone--

FRANK

What would you have me do Wheel
her out into the street so we can
all close our windows and pretend
we don’t hear the gunfire

(Looks up at Farley)
Should we put the girl in God’s
hands and call it a day

REVEREND FARLEY
There are worse hands to be in
Frank Much worse

FRANK
That may be But it wasn’t so long
ago that you wouldn’t even set foot
in our cemetary to conduct a
funeral You remember Because I
do Sometimes God’s hands are no
match against fear

REVEREND FARLEY

You think I’m a coward Frank Is
that it You think we’re all
cowards Well maybe we are

(Beat)
But I will tell you this our
community has been through the
darkest of nights Look around you
Maybe you’1ll be struck as I am by
all the people who arent here

(Points to various people)
Ella-May lost her husband of fifty-
three years Mary Richardson lost
her new baby boy The Fuller’s son
died at Verdun the Cooper’s boy at
Belleau Wood The Stevensons
graciously adopted the three
Randall children after both their
parents were killed

(Beat)
There isn’t a single family here
who hasn’t been touched by the
tragedy of the past year And now
just when the sun is finally
starting to rise

(Holds up one of the

gruesome photographs )
You want us to head back into the
shadows and face something we don’t
understand It’s asking a lot

FRANK

I know but I’m not the one asking

(Turns to face everyone)
I didn’t ask for any of this Not
for my wife to perish or my
children to die Not for sickness
Not for war And certainly not for
this girl

(Beat)
But I can’t just sit back and let
harm come to her I’m surprised
anyone here canconsidering
everything we’ve been through

(Beat)
Don’t you understand If we turn
away from this nowwe’ll never
survive it

Frank stares at a sea of blank faces

FRANK (CONTD)
Isn’t there someone here who wants
to stand up and say no more When
did we become the sort of people
who peer out of windows and hide
behind locked doors That’s not us
That’s not who we are

(Beat)

Who will stand up with me

Frank glances around the roomand starts to call names--

FRANK (CONTD)
BobThomasRalphEarl

Each man reluctantly shakes his head

FRANK (CONTD)
CharlieBen

Both men shake their heads Frank turns to his father-in-law--

FRANK (CONTD)
Eli

Eli Peterson stares at Frank with blank eyes

FRANK (CONTD)
Were family

ELI
We were

Frank takes a deep breath turning to one last person--

FRANK
Tom
Tom glances at his wife and son then looks downashamed

FRANK (CONTD)
What if it was your daughter

Tom slowly shakes his head with tears in his eyes--

TOM
It’s not

Edward stares at his father Rosaleigh trembles in her seat

FRANK
What’s wrong with you All of you
This is basic right and wrong

Rosaleigh can’t take it anymore She suddenly erupts--

ROSALEIGH
Damnit Frank it’s easy for you to
saywe have something to live
for You don’t

The room plunges to silence It’s an awful thing saybut
Rosaleigh can’t take it back--

FRANK
Is that what you think
(Then to everyone)
Is that what all of you think

Nobody responds or even looks Frank in the eye They just
stare at their handsas if idly passing the time

Frank slowly puts on his hatand walks out of the church

EXT MAIN STREET -- LATER

Frank comes outside and stares at the empty street imagining
what will be like to face gunmen all by himself

A cold wind suddenly blows dark and ominous rattling the
window panes like a harbinger of doom

Frank walks towards Sue’s clinic

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank comes inside and heads for the stairs He sees Nathan’s
TIN STAR on the counterand reluctantly picks it up BEAT

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- LATER

Sue and Leonard move quietly through the dark room picking
up the pieces after George’s terrible rampage

The door softly opens and Frank Sullivan comes inside
SHATTERED GLASS crunches beneath his feet

Frank turns on the light--

The room is torn asunder books and equipment scattered on
the floor two wounded people standing in the shadows

Frank crosses the room and grabs Sue gently by the arm She
resists for a moment then finally turns around--

Her face is bruised and bloody Swollen eyes split lip
Frank has to bite his hand just to keep from screaming--

SUE
Frank please

FRANK
Where is he

SUE
I don’t know It doesn’t matter
It’s over he’s gone
Frank glances at the girl expecting the worst--
SUE (CONTD)
She’s fine He didn’t hurt her

Frank pleasedont

Sue collapses into his arms and starts to cry Frank
hesitates then gently strokes her hair--

FRANK
Alrightalright

Leonard turns and quietly leaves the room Frank waits for
the door to shut then guides Sue over to the couch

FRANK (CONTD)
Here sit down

INT CHURCH -- SAME TIME

TOWNSPEOPLE sit in stunned silence glancing at each other as
the weight of what happened starts to take hold--

A few people begin to stand upand head for the door

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank soaks a COTTON SWAB with ALCOHOL and begins to clean
Sue’s wounds She winces in pain--

FRANK
Sorry

SUE
It’s okay Just stings a little

Frank slowly nodsand continues with care

EXT CHURCH -- THAT MOMENT

TOWNSPEOPLE come outside into the cold grim night Some
linger for a moment others start to head home

CHARLIE
I don’t know about everyone else
but I could sure use a drink

A few TOWNSPEOPLE follow Charlie towards the saloon

Tom Rosaleigh and Edward stand nearby Edward watches the
departing citizens torn by everything he’s just seen

TOM
We should probably stay in the
office tonight
(Off their looks)
The walls are reinforced by steel

Rosaleigh stares at her husband then nodsterrified

INT SALOON -- MOMENTS LATER

The bartender turns on the lights and discovers George Fowler
sitting at the counter nervously rubbing his hands

The bartender hesitates then sets down a bottle of WHISKEY
George pulls the cork and pours himself a drink

BARTENDER
George Your hands are bleeding

George looks up as the door opens behind him Charlie Foster
and some other TOWNSPEOPLE begin to trickle inside

George grabs the bottle and flees into the back room

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME

Sue stares at Frank as he quietly treats her wounds

SUE
He wasn’t always like this Incase
you were wondering

FRANK
Wondering what

SUE
(a moment then)
Why I married him

A TRAIN WHISTLE suddenly shrieks far in the distance so
faint that Frank and Sue barely seem to notice

SUE (CONTD)
You and Emily ever fight

FRANK
On occasion

SUE
Did it ever getbad

Frank looks at herand suddenly grasps her meaning--

FRANK

No Never

(Beat)
It was always over little things
Should we get indoor plumbing Buy
a car Was Kathryn old enough to
date We argued about the future

(Then softly)
Guess it was pretty silly
considering we didn’t have one

Frank tapes a BANDAGE to Sue’s cheek They stare at each
other for a moment their faces just inches apart

SUE
Why did you leave me

Frank’s eyes flicker wounded and filled with regret--

FRANK
I don’t know how to answer that
Sue I really don’t

Sue takes out the Rough Rider photograph which she’s kept
all this time She slowly hands it to Frank--

SUE
Was it everything they said it was
going to be

(MORE)

SUE (CONTD)
Roosevelt and his legendary Rough
Ridersthe adventure of a
lifetime

Frank stares at the photograph ashamed

SUE (CONT’D)
I read stories about massacres
one newspaper called it genocide

FRANK
That’s one way of putting it

Frank stares at his past self thinking of his son--

FRANK (CONTD)
All men fight in wars for the same
reason Sue It’s a matter of luck
whether you get to be on the right
side of history or not

Sue points to the young man in the photograph--

SUE
You knowevery now and then I
think about the boy who left all
those years agoand what life
wouldve been like had he stayed
(Beat)
I imagine he would’ve been kind

The train whistle suddenly shrieks again close enough now
that Frank and Sue can hear its engine chugging forward

SUE (CONT’D)
Is there going to be more
bloodshed

Frank’s dark eyes give her the answer--

SUE (CONTD)
You’re certain

FRANK
As much as I am that the earth
turns

SUE

Is Tom going to help you
Frank hesitates then slowly shakes his head

SUE (CONT’D)
What about the others

Frank holds up the TIN STAR Nathan abandoned--

FRANK
I’m all alone on this

Frank sets the badge down and stares at it for a moment

FRANK (CONTD)
I never wondered why you married
him I always knew The only thing
I never understood waswhy you
didnt wait

SUE
Frank when you leftI was angry
I’m sorry

Frank reaches out and touches her bruised face Sue leans
into his hand as tears trickle down her cheek

Then in the depths of silence Frank hears something--

FRANK
Listen

SUE
What There’s nothing

FRANK
(Dramatic Beat)
I knowthe train stopped

EXT MAIN STREET -- THAT MOMENT

TOWNSPEOPLE stare at the distant station where thick tufts
of smoke float into the dark evening sky--

EXT TRAIN STATION -- THAT MOMENT

A LONG TRAIN sits on the tracks lurking ominously in the
night like a dark trojan horse Then suddenly--

A CAR DOOR bursts open

A MAN steps onto the platform All alone Dressed in a
beautiful suit wearing confidence like a bullet proof vest

He looks around the empty station smiling at the shadows
Then he slowly turnsand walks straight into town--

EXT MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

The man strolls down the street whistling a familiar tune
(Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling )

The melody floats through the air cheerful and creepy
TOWNSPEOPLE flee into buildings as the stranger approaches

INT SALOON -- THAT MOMENT

PATRONS take cover

INT SUNDRY STORE -- THAT MOMENT

Kay ducks out of view

INT TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

Eli Peterson sits at his desk quietly listening

INT SHERIFF’S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

Tom Rosaleigh and Edward exchange nervous glances

Farley watches a DARK FIGURE float past his window

INT LEONARD DUSCHENE’S ROOM -- THAT MOMENT

Leonard slowly turns and opens his bedroom closet He stares
at his WWI UNIFORMand then pulls out his RIFLE

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

The young girl squirms in fear as the whistling comes closer
Sue checks her pulse Frank goes to the window

EXT SALOON -- THAT MOMENT

The stranger looks up at the WWI BANNER and suddenly stops
whistling Then he smilesand enters the saloon

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

Frank steps away from the window and heads for the door Sue
watches him leave then glances back at the young girl

INT SALOON -- THAT MOMENT

The stranger smiles as PATRONS stand up from behind their
tablesand reluctantly sit back down--

STRANGER
You folks expecting a tornado or
something

Charlie glances at Ben from the corner of his eye Everyone
else looks away too frightened to answer

BARTENDER
What’1l it be Mister

STRANGER
Shot of rye if ya got it

The bartender nods and starts to pour The stranger glances
over his shoulder drawing strength from everyone’s fear--

STRANGER (CONTD)
Nice town ya got here

BARTENDER
Passing through

STRANGER
Something like that

The stranger picks up his drink and gulps it down--

EXT MAIN STREET -- THAT MOMENT

Frank Sullivan steps out into the empty street making his
way towards the saloon

INT SHERIFF’S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

Tom stares quietly out the window watching his friend charge
through the night towards the unknown

EDWARD

Tom glances at his son unsure BEAT

INT SALOON -- SAME TIME

The stranger sets down his empty glass

BARTENDER

The stranger nods why not The bartender pours

STRANGER
Got a doctor around these parts

PATRONS glance nervously at each other
STRANGER (CONTD)

Say you get shot for example
where would you go

BARTENDER
I really don’t know I’m the not
the person to talk to about that
sort of thing
The stranger stares at the bartender and smiles--

STRANGER
What do I owe for the rye

BARTENDER
Thirty cents

STRANGER
Tell you what

The stranger throws a wad of MONEY on the counter--
STRANGER (CONTD)
Ill make it a hundred dollarsif
you tell me who is the person to
talk to about that sort of thing

BARTENDER
I don’t understand

STRANGER
Oh I think you do

The bartender shakes his head as the stranger leans forward
focused unrelentingrefusing to take no for an answer

And then suddenly they hear a door open--

Frank Sullivan comes into the bar He stares at the stranger
for a moment then sits down at a nearby table

The stranger glances at the bartender “Him”
The bartender nodsand pockets the hundred dollars
ACROSS THE ROOM

Frank listens to the stranger’s approaching footsteps and
then looks up as a dark shadow falls across his face--

STRANGER (CONTD)
I’m wondering if you could help me

FRANK
You don’t look like the sort of man
who needs much help

The stranger smiles and sits down--

STRANGER
We all need a little help
especially in a strange town
(Beat)
I’m looking for a girl Medium
build Five and a half feet tall
Fair complexion Very beautiful
(Beat)
Sound like anybody you know

Frank shakes his head as the door opens again Tom Donovan
quietly enters followed by Reverend Farley

STRANGER (CONT’D)
I work for some people who are very
concerned about her We have reason
to believe she was in the area
Sent a couple men out looking for
her butthey seem to have
disappeared

FRANK
Maybe they ran off together Maybe
they don’t want to be found

STRANGER
Well if that’s the case it’s even
more important that we find them
The girl at least

FRANK
(Confused)
What about the men

STRANGER
As long as we find the girl wed
be willing to forget about them
Call it an even exchange
(Dramatic Beat)
Our menfor your deputy

The stranger sets a BLOOD-STAINED BADGE down on the table--

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Youll be happy to know he was very
brave Didn’t even scream Said to
tell his kids he loved ‘em

Frank glances at Tom frozen across the room

STRANGER (CONTD)
Is it a matter of money If not
then what is it I saw that
cemetery when I came in

(MORE )

STRANGER (CONTD)
Pretty crowded How many able-
bodied men could this town possibly
have left

Frank slowly looks up calm and defiant--

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Do you have any idea who you’re
dealing with Look what we did ina
few short hours You wired for the
feds Our men showed up instead
Your telegraph is cut Your train
station is off the map Don’t you
realize how alone you are

Frank stares at the strangerbut doesn’t respond BEAT

STRANGER (CONTD)

You knowI remember when the flu
spread last year the government
sent a dispatch to towns like this
You probably got it

(Quoting)
--”Round up your woodworkers and
set them to making coffins Then
round up your street laborersand
set them to digging graves

(Beat)
That was all the help you got then
And it’s all you’re getting now

The stranger suddenly reaches into his coat Everyone tenses
fearing he’s about to draw a gun

-but the stranger takes out a collection of PAPERS
instead He looks up at Frank smiling like the devil

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Do you know how easy it is to
intercept a telegraph A few snips
and a little cutand the signal
gets re-routed
(Holds up first page)
From the town of Sparks

Everyone leans forward as the stranger reads--

---Good luck stop

The stranger throws the papers down on the table--

STRANGER (CONTD)
You can read the rest for yourself
They all say the same thing
Nobody’s coming Why would they

Frank shuffles through the messages one at a time
stranger watches genuinely puzzled--

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Why are you doing this What’s in
it for you Do you even know who
youre risking your life for

Frank’s eyes flicker faintly with doubt--

STRANGER (CONT’D)

You think she’s worth saving A
damsel in distress in need of a
white knight You think by
defending her you’1l redeem this
town Maybe even yourself That
youve finally got a cause worth
fighting for Boyhave I got a
few surprises for you

(Raising his voice)
She’s a hooker Sorry to disappoint
you butthat’s what she is A
two-bit whore Pay her enough
she’ll do anything you want Fucked
the wrong guy heard the wrong
things And now she’s a nothing
witness in a nothing case

(Beat)
Youre telling me you’re gonna risk
your life and lives of all these
people to save someone like her
Have you thought this through
Trains and telegraphs are the least
we can do

The

STRANGER (CONTD)
Well wipe this town off the face
of the earth You’ll see We’re
just getting warmed up

The stranger looks around the room as his words take hold--

STRANGER (CONTD)
Now why don’t you do the sensible
thing and mind your own business
This girl has no friends No
family When she’s gone there will
be no newspaper headlines mourning
her death She won’t have a funeral
or even an obituary Because no one
will remember her long enough to
forget her It’ll be as though she
never existed All you have to do
is order another drink and try not
to worry about things that are
beyond your control Alright

Frank hesitates -- deep in thought And then--

George Fowler comes out of the back room and takes a seat at
the bar totally oblivious to what’s going on

FRANK
Excuse me

Frank stands up and charges across the room The stranger
watches confused by his sudden departure

AT THE COUNTER

Frank grabs Charlie’s empty BEER GLASS and hurls it right
into George’s face He looks up stunned--

Frank knocks two of his teeth out with the first blow The
second bruises a kidney and the third cracks a rib

TOWNSPEOPLE flee from the eye of the storm
ACROSS THE ROOM

The stranger watches the attack with a faint smile as if
suddenly recognizing a worthy opponent

NEAR THE DOOR
Tom steps forward trying to restore order--
TOM

Frank Frank That’s enough You’re
killing him

Frank slams George’s face into the counter shards of glass
splinter his skin George drops to the ground--
Frank bends over about to lift him to his feet
-when he suddenly hears the click of a gun--

TOM (CONTD)
Goddamnit Frank I said enough

Frank looks up and sees Tom pointing a SHOTGUN at him from
across the room His eyes fill with betrayaland rage

TOM (CONT’D)
Back away Now

Frank slowly approaches his friend--
FRANK
You’re gonna shoot me Tom Or just

arrest me

Tom peers over the shotgun as Frank takes a step closer both
barrels now just inches from his chest And then--

Frank snatches the gun out of Tom’s hands Everyone gasps as
he opens the boxlock letting the shells fall to the floor

FRANK (CONTD)
Youre not doing either today
(Quoting Tom from earlier)
Now why don’t you do what you’re
good at Sheriffand stand aside
Frank throws the gun down and charges back across the room

FRANK (CONTD)
Sam whiskey

The bartender sets a BOTTLE down Frank picks it up
AT THE END OF THE BAR

George pulls himself to his feet Blood pours down his face
blinding his vision He slowly turns around

Frank smashes his face with the whiskey bottle

Glass shatters the alcohol stinging like acid George
screamsand goes down for the count

But Frank is on top of him punching and wailing kicking and
tomping beating this man within an inch of his life

ACROSS THE ROOM

The stranger glances around the saloon assessing different
people’s reactions Some seem horrified Others inspired

AT THE BAR

Finally Frank stops Just short of murder He grabs George
by the collar and gets right in his face

FRANK (CONTD)
Look at methis is what happens
when you hurt women

Frank throws George back to the ground then slowly turns
around to face the lingering stranger--

FRANK (CONTD)
You were saying

The stranger smiles And picks up right where he left off--
STRANGER
There’s no need for you to go and
get the good people of this town
hurt All we want is the girl
Frank wipes the blood off his face then--

FRANK
You can’t have her

The stranger stares at Frank with a faint smile There it is
The dye is cast Frank Sullivan has crossed the Rubicon

The stranger glances at George writhing on the ground then
walks across the roomand disappears out the door

EXT SALOON -- CONTINUOUS

The stranger looks up once more at the WWI banner Then he
turns and walks down the streetwhistling the entire way

INT SALOON -- SAME TIME

Everyone stares at at Frank Sullivan--

He doesn’t ask for any help or offer any explanations He
just puts one foot in front of the other

and charges right out the front door BEAT

Tom watches the door shut then walks across the room and
picks up his deputy’s TIN STAR He wipes it with his thumb

the blood smears across the metal leaving Tom Donovan to
stare at his own reflection in the brass-colored tin

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Sue looks up as Frank comes into the room She sees the blood
on his shirt Her eyes suddenly go wide--

Frank grabs Sue by the arm and pulls her to the door
SUE
Frank wait a minute Frank
(Then screaming)
-take your hands off me

Frank suddenly lets go Sue looks at him softly--

SUE (CONT’D)
Sorry

Frank nods quietly then glances at the girl still asleep
completely unaware of what this man is about to do for her

SUE (CONT’D)
Are you sure about this

Frank hesitates then slowly shakes his head--

SUE (CONTD)
Then don’t Please justdon’t

FRANK
It’s too late I’m sorry

Frank turns and heads for the door Sue follows him
realizing she may never see him again--

SUE
I don’t understandwhy is this
your responsibility Frank stop

She grabs his arm desperate to make him stay--

SUE (CONT’D)
Tell me why Why do you have to go
out there and face this alone

Frank suddenly erupts frustrated and out of time--

FRANK
Goddamnit because I don’t have a
choice Because there’s a chance I
might be able to help someone
tonight And I have to go Do you
understand I have to go

Sue slowly lets go of his arm Frank stares at her for a
moment then nods at the young girl--

FRANK (CONTD)
Push her away from the window
before the fighting starts

And then he turns and walks down the hall

SUE
Frank
(He stops turns around)
When it’s all over I’1l be here
(Softly)

---waiting
Frank slowly nods then disappears down the stairs

EXT MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

beneath his boots as he walks down the empty street

TOM
What are you doing

EDWARD

the limp in my step

TOM
(Hesitates)
I hadnt noticed

EDWARD
Sure you did You both did You
just pretended not to

Tom steps forward scared to know the answer--

TOM
Edward I asked you a question
why are you loading that rifle

Edward slides a final round into the chamber and slams it
home He turns to face his father--

EDWARD
It was just outside Neuve Chapelle
I took a bullet in the thigh

TOM
You never mentioned it in your
letters

EDWARD

There were a lot of things I didn’t
mention in my letters

(Beat)
There was a french family who gave
me shelter If the Germans had
found me that family would’ve been
executed I was a stranger to them
just like this girl is a stranger
to you and yet they risked their
lives in order to save mine

Edward turns to leave having made his point

TOM
Where are you going

EDWARD
To do what I can

Tom pulls Edward back from the door--

TOM
No damnit you’re staying here
Your mother and I didn’t wait
through that blasted war just to
lose you in some street brawl

EDWARD
Let go of me I’m not a child--

TOM
Youre my child

Edward looks at his father suddenly calm--
EDWARD
I know you’re afraid
(Beat)
But I’m only alive because of
people like Frank Sullivan

Tom’s grip weakens and Edward pulls way He glances at his
mother one last time then opens the doorand leaves

(To Frank)

Hands in the air

Frank glances up at the ceiling taking notice of the hanging
CHANDELIER -- the rooms only light source

Frank raises his armsbut doesn’t drop his rifle
GANGSTER (CONT’D)
Hey Bright BoyI meant drop the
gun first
Frank suddenly pulls the trigger and the chandelier explodes
The room plunges to darkness as TOMMY GUNS erupt-—-

The brutal gunshots light up the room with ear-splitting
violence Anguished screams of dying men quickly follow--

Anything that moves gets shot at Bodies dance at the
bullets torn apart in the deadly crossfire

And then the guns fall with their owners hitting the blood-
soaked ground as powdered smoke fills the room

The stillness lingers for a momentand then suddenly
there’s movement A body shifting on the floor--

It’s Frank still alive Last man standing But he’s wounded
-bad enough that he’s unable to get back on his feet

So he crawls through fallen bodies and pools of blood Hand
over hand foot over foot reaching for the stairs

EXT MAIN STREET -- THAT MOMENT

The stranger stares at Sue’s clinic now quiet in the absence
of gunfire He walks across the street

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- UPSTAIRS -- THAT MOMENT

door open downstairs The stranger is inside the building

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT

The stranger lights a KEROSENE LAMP and stares at the bodies
on the floor He sees a blood trail leading up the stairs

And then the stranger hears Frank crawling

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Frank pushes the door open and crawls into the room as the
stranger’s footsteps start to thunk up the stairs

Frank looks around desperate to find something he can use to
block the door But there’s nothing He’s stuck

Frank turns and crawls over to the girl’s bedside

He reaches up with his good arm and pulls her down to the
floor Her limp body lands softly beside him

Frank leans her against the bed as the stranger’s footsteps
reach the top of the stairs and come down the hall

Thunkthunkthunk

Frank takes out his revolver and opens the cylinder He
slides the last few rounds into the chamber

Then suddenly--
Frank feels a tremor of movement beside him
He slowly turnsand sees--—

The young girl is awake staring right at him

The life in Frank’s eyes is fading fast And the strangers
boots have stopped just outside the door

With his last ounce of strength Frank puts the loaded gun
into the girl’s handsand pulls back the hammer

Frank stares at the girl for a dramatic moment then falls
into her lap as the door softly opens
The girl slowly looks up horrified--

The stranger enters the room each footstep slow and ominous
He holds up his lantern and looks right at her

The girl’s breathing quickens She clearly recognizes him

The stranger smiles and takes another step forward And then
he shifts his glance to Frank Sullivan lying on the floor

The girl’s eyes narrow with steely resolve No longer afraid
Sensing an opportunity She raises Frank’s revolver

-and pulls the trigger

The lantern shatters as the bullet explodes the stranger’s
skull A mesh of brains blood and teeth splatter the wall--

The stranger drops to his knees

And then his body falls forward like a giant tree hitting
the wooden floor with a dull sickening thud

The girl’s breathing grows calm She slowly lowers the
smoking gunand looks down at Frank Sullivan--

His eyes appear vacant and his chest rises and falls with the
shallowest of breaths We are watching him die

--but then the young girl’s hand dips into frame caressing
his neck She leans down and wraps her arms around him

And Frank seems to draw strength from her embrace

More HANDS suddenly appear The surviving TOWNSPEOPLE hoist
Frank into the air and carry him over to the table

Sue Fowler immediately goes to work

Tom and Edward help the girl walk across the room and sit
down in a chair She turns and looks out the window--

Bodies litter the street The girls eyes go wide

She glances back at Frank Sullivan lying on the table
surrounded by friends fighting to save his life

Frank Sullivan a man she’s never met but who risked
everything to save her For reasons she may never know

FADE TO BLACK

soft layer of white as far as the eye can see

Frank Sullivan lies in bed his body tattooed with bruises
and lacerations Suddenly he opens his eyes

»and sees someone across the room--

Sue Fowler gets out of her chair and slowly approaches She
kneels at his bedside smiling gently--

SUE
How are you feeling

Frank glances at his body then nods Not badconsidering

INT SULLIVAN HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS -- LATER

Frank and Sue come out into the hallway and limp towards the
stairs They start to tackle them one a time

Halfway down Frank Sullivan suddenly stops

His house is filled with PEOPLE-- The Donovans Kay Anderson
A few familiar faces from the saloon

Frank and Sue reach the main floor and everyone surrounds
them Frank smiles as he receives pats on the back

And then he senses another presence in the room--
The youn irl

She’s standing near the window wearing a brand new dress
looking vibrant beautifuland full of life

Frank’s breathing quickens as she stands before him looking
deep into the eyes of the man who saved her life

As tears begin to fall down her cheeks the girl throws her
arms around Frank and holds on for dear life

Everyone watches this tender scene unfold touched by Frank’s
journey Satisfied by his reward

Frank Sullivan was dealt the greatest of tragedies But in
this momenthe has an awful lot to live for
