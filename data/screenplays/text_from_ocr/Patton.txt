PATTON

(NOTE All scenes in which
Germans speak will be shot in
German with English subtitles)

FADE IN
EXT PLATFORM - MED VIEW - DAY

Our entire frame is filled with the image of an American
flag stretched tight We hear a jumble of conversation
in the bg3 then

VOICE

(083
At-ten-shun

Now we hear the click of hundreds of boots GENERAL
GEORGE S PATTON JR steps into our view more than
six feet tall he looms high against the bg of the
flag He glares down at us the audience

A MILITARY BAND plays THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER Patton
comes to a smart salute and we watch him for the dura-
tion of the entire anthem He is straight and husky and
as gaudy as a peacock His helmet is lacquered and
shines with four silver stars He wears a tailored tunic
with four stars on each shoulder thirty brightly hued
decorations on the left breast five horizontal and three
diagonal gold stripes on the sleeve Beneath the tunic
he wears a shirt with four stars on each lapel making a
total of twenty stars A vivid blue sash is draped

across his breast parallel to one of yellow A red
collar sash weighted by another medal hangs from his neck
The rest of his costume consists of a gold-buckled belt
with his ivory-handled pistols on either side riding
breeches boots and a riding crop Four stars on the
handle of his pistols brings the grand total to twenty-
eight stars On his fingers he wears four conspicuous
rings

SERIES OF CUTS

As the anthem continues we cut to a series of tight
shots featuring various aspects of Pattons uniform and
decorations -- emphasizing the clusters of stars on his
shoulders his shirt his pistols
C)

CLOSE SHOT - PATTON

The anthem concludes and he completes his salute Now
this twenty-eight-star general scans us carefully In

a vibrant voice
directly at us

and with a cold mean look he speaks

PATTON

At ease men I want you to remember
that no bastard ever won a war by
dying for his country He won it by

making

the other poor dumb bastard

die for his country Men the stuff
we heard about America not wanting

to fight wanting to stay out of the
war was a lot of horsedung Americans
traditionally love to fight All real
Americans love the sting of battle
When you were kids you all admired the
champion marble player the fastest

runner

the big league ballplayers the

toughest boxers Americans love a

winner

and do not tolerate a loser

Americans play to win all the time

I wouldnt give a hoot in hell for a
man who lost and laughed Thats why
Americans have never lost and will
never lose a war for the very thought
of losing is hateful to Americans

An army is a team It lives sleeps
eats fights as a team This individu-

ality s

tuff is a lot of crap The

bilious bastards who wrote that stuff
about individuality for the Saturday
Evening Post dont know any more about
real battle than they do about a sock
full of silt We have the finest
food equipment the best spirit and

men in

the world Why by God I

actually pity those poor bastards
were going against -- by God I do

We won

t just shoot the bastards

Were going to cut out their living
guts and use them to grease the

treads
murder
the bus

of our tanks Were going to
those lousy Hun bastards by
hel Many of you boys are

wondering whether youll chicken out
under fire Dont worry about it
I can assure you you will all do your

duty

The Nazis are the enemy Wade

into them and spill their blood
Shoot them in the belly When you
stick your hand into a bunch of Zoo
that a moment before was your best

friend’

S faceyoull know what to

PATTON (Cont )

do Theres another thing I want you
to remember I dont want to get any
messages saying We are holding our
position Were not holding anything
Let the Hun do that We are advancing
constantly and are not interested in
holding anything except onto the
enemy Were going to hold onto him
by the nose and kick him in the ass
Well kick the hell out of him all
the time Well go through them like
crap through a goose

pause)
Theres one thing you men will be able
to say when you get home You wIhay all
thank God for it Thirty years from
now when you are sitting around the
fireside with your grandson on your
knee and he asks what you did in the
great World War II you wont have to
say I shoveled shit in Louisiana

(pause)
All right -- now you sonsuvbitches
know how I feel I will be proud to °
lead you wonderful guys into battle
anytime anywhere

He stares sincerely almost wet-eyed at us for a moment

FEBRUARY 1943

We view the enormous sloping desert baking hot in the
midday sun Tanks half-tracks and self-propelled
artillery are spread about in the distance Scattered
over the hot sands are the bodies of dead Americans
Arab women and children dressed in brightly colored
costumes scavenge the uniforms boots and equipment
and pack them on heavily laden camels

a

MED SHOT - ARAB WOMEN

One woman an infant strapped to her back and a small
child helping her strips a soldier totally naked and
hurries the precious belongings to the camel pack The
women work quickly and silently there are no games no
joking no playing with the treasure

We hear the sound of motor vehicles approaching

battlefield grimly He is a tall lanky gentle-looking
man His face has great strength but his eyes reflect
wisdom and understanding

TWO SHOT - REAR OF COMMAND CAR

Beside Bradley is BRIGADIER GENERAL CARVER (Fictitious
character -- no subtitle) Since he participated in the
debacle he is diffident about commenting on it --
especially to a representative of General Eisenhower

CARVER
The Arabs need food and clothing
They strip our dead before we can
even bury them

BRADLEY
(studying the scene)
Looks like the reports were accurate

EXT PARADE GROUND AT MARRAKECH - MED CLOSE SHOT -
MOUNTED KETTLEDRUMMER - DAY

SUBTITLE MARRAKECH -- MOROCCO - 1943

The exotically caparisoned mounted Drummer filis the
screen as he beats his two huge instruments with a
flourish Visually as well as auditorially this is in
sharpest contrast to the preceding scene A military
band of about one hundred pieces is blaring out a
martial air

Camera pulls back to reveal the entire mounted band of

a Moroccan regiment of Chasseurs-a-Cheval with their
sheep mascot and bell-covered umbrella Lined up behind
the band is the regiment in scarlet uniforms white
capes and turbans

MED SHOT - REVIEWING STAND

The colorfully garbed SULTAN addresses General Patton
whose uniform and decorations are only slightly less
bizarre than those about him

SULTAN
My people salute you General --
for your brilliant amphibious
landing on the continent of Africa
-- and for your enlightened
administration of my country

PATTON
Ive enjoyed being here
Your Excellency But naturally Id
prefer to be up at the front in
Tunisia fighting Germans

The Sultan nods places the ribbon of a large disc-shaped
decoration around Pattons neck

EXT GERMAN POW ENCLOSURE - MED SHOT - DAY

Camera moves with barbed wire fence in fg along the
outside of the POW cage picking up the faces of the
American prisoners inside They are a grim bearded
dirty and dejected lot

Camera picks up an immaculate Africa Corps staff COLONEL
striding along outside the wire carrying a briefcase

We follow him as he crosses to a command car in which is
seated a German Field Marshal surrounded by aides and
staff officers

MED SHOT AT COMMAND CAR

ROMMEL goggles on chest is studying a map on which an
officer is pointing out dispositions

the Colonel a sharp glance

Cont

ROMMEL
I wouldnt be so sure after one
battle Their tanks were no match
for our guns

COLONEL
One could say the same sir for
their leadership

Rommel eyes the Colonel evenly Hes not that easily
flattered

ROMMEL
They were not under American command
at Kasserine They were under British
General Anderson -- did you know that

COLONEL
(undaunted he smiles)
British commanders and American
troops They had the worst of
everything

ROMMEL
I remind you that Montgomery is
a British commander And he has
driven us halfway across Africa

COLONEL
In any case we have met the
Americans for the first time and
defeated them Personally I
feel extremely optimistic

Rommel eyes him with dry disdain

ROMMEL
You can afford to be an optimist
I cant

EXT US II CORPS HEADQUARTERS DJEBEL KOUIF TOWN SQUARE
FULL SHOT - DAY

The jeep bearing Bradley Carver and Hansen drives up in
front of the headquarters Lounging dejectedly outside
is a group of unkempt GIs Bearded and unsoldierly they
straggle to their feet some managing a ragged salute

It is clearly a unit without discipline or morale a unit
thats suffered defeat

Bradley and Carver return the salutes as they step out
of the jeep Bradley studies the soldiers Closely as the
jeep pulls away and Hansen goes on inside
28 TWO SHOT - BRADLEY AND CARVER

BRADLEY
(quietly as he eyes
the soldiers)
These men fight at Kasserine

CARVER
(uneasily)
Yes sir

Bradley moves to go inside changes his mind turns to
Carver asking for franimess

BRADLEY
John General Eisenhower sent me down
here to make a report and Ive got
to lay it on the line What went
wrong

CARVER
Everything Second-rate ta --
bad intelligence -- green troops
So green some of the boys marked
our mine fields for their own
protection and forgot to take the
flags down

BRADLEY
(eyeing him shrewdly)
Green commanders too

CARVER
Yes sir

BRADLEY

For the American Army to take a
licking like that our first time
at bat against the Germans --

(he shakes his head)
Up against Rommel we need the best
tank man weve got Somebody tough
enough to pull this outfit together

CARVER

glance)
George Patton

BRADLEY

Possibly --

CARVER
God help us

9-A
EXT THE DESERT - EXTREME FULL VIEW - DAWN

We see the distant apparition of a chain of military
vehicles kicking up the dust as it speeds along the
desert silhouetted before a great rising rosy sun

A siren wails coming out of nowhere and growing louder
and louder until the half-track- with banners flying
and machine guns fore and aft comes at us as ostenta
tiously as a fire engine

MED SHOT

General Patton in a bulky trench coat stands upright
in the armored car his face grimacing into the wind
a Caesar in his chariot

EXT DJEBEL KOUIF TOWN SQUARE - FULL SHOT - DAY

The caravan roars into the decrepit square opposite the
schoolhouse that serves as II Corps Headquarters Arabs
scurry through the streets in the midst of a cackling
exodus of camels and chickens

ANOTHER ANGLE

The caravan comes to a halt before the schoolhouse where
a single SENTRY stands sloppily at his post Patton
steps over the side of his car followed by a Lieutenant
and a Captain

Patton regards the town square and the scruffy-looking
soldiers lounging in it his face frozen in the same
expression as when it was blown by the wind

PATTONS POV

Groups of unshaven GIs wearing sweaters and field jackets
yawning and indescribably slack pyll themselves to their
feet Most of them manage a ragged series of salutes
Others simply watch with mild curiosity

CLOSE SHOT - PATTON
His jaw tightens his eyes begin to flash
TWO SHOT - CAPTAIN AND LIEUTENANT

man STILLER in his mid-forties

SUBTITLE CAPTAIN RICHARD N JENSON

AIDES TO GENERAL PATTON

CLOSE SHOT - PATTON

Eyes flashing rage barely under control he drews him-
self up and snaps off an ultrasmart salute to the ragged
crew Turning on his heel he passes a crudely built

sign designating II Corps Headquarters on which a chicken
squats Nearby an Arab peddier leans unimpressed against
a pen of chickens

ANGLE AT ENTRANCE II CORPS HEADQUARTERS

The Sentry without tie and needing a shave pulls him-
self to attention as Patton approaches The man manages
a salute then stares at Patton with a slack-jawed and
not unfriendly smile

Pattons eyes widen Incapable of speech there issues
from within him a volcanic rumble that is almost a retch
Failing to return the mans salute he strides into the
building

JENSON
Sentry wheres the Duty Officer
SENTRY
Sir I dont rightly know
JENSON
Is he in the building
SENTRY
Sir Im under the impression he

is not

Visibly irritated Jenson goes on into the building
following Stiller

InT II CORPS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Jenson follows Stiller down the corridor which is quite
dark because the blackout curtains have not yet been
pulled open Patton can be seen down the corridor
opening doors glancing inside slamming them shut again
He opens a map room door and steps inside followed by
Stiller

the desk lights a cigar

PATTON
Tell me Brad -- what are you

BRADLEY
Apparently everything went wrong

new insignia An expression of doubt flashes across

work)
George if you were named Admiral
of the Turkish Navy Ill bet your
aides could dip into their haversacks
and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank

Anyway -- premature congratulations

Their ceremonial duties over Stiller goes out and Jensén
busies himself arranging a desk for himself Patton rises
and crosses to a mirror to inspect his-new rank Bradley
crosses to the window

PATTON
Those stars would look a lot better
on green shirt Did I ever tell
you I once designed a uniform for
tank crewmen It was green leather
with red stripes sort of a row of
brass buttons here and topped by a

This is a large room thats been converted into enlisted
mens quarters with rows of bunks combat gear etc As
Patton accompanied by Jenson sweeps through the empty
room his eye falls on a pinup tacked to the wall We get
a glimpse of a raw provocative pose of an enormously
bosomed girl Patton pauses his Puritan outrage
unmistakable

it down sternly Then he marches out

as he passes the first stall The soldier inside is hat-
less

second stall)
No helmet and no leggings --
twenty-five dollars

He crosses to the third stall where a very young and
sharply turned-out GI sits at attention a polished
helmet on his head He looks straight ahead but his
face wears a vacuous and slightly pained expression
appropriate to what hes doing

PATTON
Now that man looks like a soldier

EXT DJEBEL KOUIF TOWN SQUARE - MED SHOT - Day

Patton and Jenson cross the square to the building being
used for a hospital They are trailed by wide-eyed
urchins

PATTON

fatigue Once you concede its reality
you admit the reality of demoralization
And you cant win battles with demoralized
troops That sort of thing has to be stopped
or you get an uncontrollable infection
Like conscientious objection

busy ward where he is met by a MEDICAL OFFICER Nurses

Excuse me General --

Patton is distracted by his cigar which has gone dead
He puffs frantically but it is out Almost instantly
Codman appears in scene whips out a Zippo and lights
the Generals cigar Patton accepts the light without
noticing Codman His job with the Zippo done Codman
disappears from the scene Davenport resumes glancing
at paper in his hand

DAVENPORT
Sir this is interesting Weve
discovered that Rommel wasnt present
at El Guetter

PATTON

personal affront )
Who says so

They trying to tell me that when
we took on Tenth Panzer Rommel was
in Berlin with an earache

G-2 also reports that Hitler probably
retained Rommel in Berlin because
things were going badly for the Africa

Patton gets the cigar going notices Codman for the first
time

CARVER
General this is Lieutenant Colonel
Codman your new aide

PATTON
Oh yes

because I know your family

CODMAN
Im glad you did sir

PATTON
Codman that Kraut Rommel is the
best they have -- and I kicked hell
out of him Now my own G-2 section
is trying to tell me he wasnt even
there

CODMAN
(polite diplomatic
soothingly quiet)
But General he undoubtedly planned
the German battle

Patton glares at him frowning unsure of Codmans point

CODMAN
If you defeat Rommels plan youve
defeated Rommel Isnt that true sir

Somewhat mollified Patton takes a long pull on the cigar
as he studies his new aide finds more here than meets the
eye Obviously a man of taste and discretion

Patton rises a little flush-faced as the British ladies
applaud Codman leans over and whispers to him

CODMAN
Remember sir -- watch your language

Patton takes his place at the podium

PATTON

My dear ladies until today my only
experience in welcoming has been to
welcome Germans and Italians to the
infernal regions In this I have
been quite successful as the troops
whom I have had the honor to command
have killed or captured some 170000
of our enemies

With that the ladies go into another dainty round of
applause a few of them shouting in their meek little
voices Hear hear

tries to get Pattons attention

CODMAN

The Russians Dont forget the
Russians

Patton turns but cant hear what Codman is saying because
of the applause Scowling at Codman he turns back and
proceeds

PATTON
A club like this is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding
As soon as our soldiers meet and
know the English ladies and write
home and tell our women how truly
lovely you arethe sooner the
American ladies will get jealous
and force this war to a quick
termination And I will then get
a chance to go to the Pacific and
kill Japanese

final authority)

Yes sir -- goddammit

326 INT PATTONS COMMAND POST - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

Patton is fencing with a young BRITISH LIAISON OFFICER

(Perhaps saber would be more interesting and effective
than foils) Patton is more expert than the Englishman --
and much more aggressive He slashes away always on the
attack -- never parries Jilly is lying on the floor
watching the fencers Bell enters the room not at all
surprised at what is going on

very badly wounded

Patton stops fencing slowly lowers his saber After a
moment he growls
