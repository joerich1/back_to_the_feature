Second Draft
IN A SUNNY BACKYARD RIMMED WITH TALL SUCCULENTS AND
MANICURED BOULDERS LOOKING OUT AT AN ENDLESS DESERT

ROLL CREDITS as a group of LATINOS lay down some lush
green sod a carpet of grass like an oasis in the
surrounding desert A handsome man JEFF walks into
frame and surveys the scene happy then walks away

A new angle reveals the nearly finished yard A lone
LATINO steps out of the way for THE SPRINKLERS TO COME
ON It’s heaven

IN A FESTIVE MEXICAN RESTAURANT

MARIACHIS PLAY as a dinner party swings Half are
doctors half are married to them Half have a Margarita-
spirited argument about the incompetence of the
hospital’s nursing staff (ad lib) the other half tries
to change the subject when MERIDETH stands

MERIDETH
Okay enough nonsense

The party comes to attention as A LATINO WAIT STAFF
enters with a cart of entrees

MERIDETH (CONTD)
I want to talk about the man and woman
we’ve come here to honor tonight on their
fifteenth wedding anniversary That’s a
long time but as long as Ron and I’ve
known Jeff and Nealy they’ve always been
not just great friends but a model
They’ve really taught us what love is

Jeff and NEALY LANG beautiful share a sober look Jeff
is bouncing their two and a half year old boy LUKE on his
knee

MERIDETH (CONT’D)
They’ve taught us also about perseverance
though hard times They’re great parents
What else

As she looks to her husband RON to keep up the toast
CAMERA PUSHES to a claustrophobic frame of Jeff and Nealy and
Luke

RON
The way you’ve always supported each
other Jeff helping Nealy finally open
her store and emailing us all about it
repeatedly that we should come spend our
fortunes

(MORE)
RON (CONTD)

And Nealy supporting Jeff though med
school working nine to five--I know this
stuff has inspired all of us who know
you So happy anniversary we love you
and look forward to one day sharing the
same nursing home with you To Jeff and
Nealy

Everyone raises a glass and says TO JEFF AND NEALY They

all say CHEERS A moment later Luke raises his glass
too

LUKE
Cheers

Everyone laughs at this and adores Luke Nealy kisses
him
AT HOME IN THEIR BEDROOM

Jeff and Nealy get undressed and get into bed They
regard each other She kisses him a peck on the mouth

JEFF
I drank way too many Margaritas for a
Monday night

NEALY
And I ate way too much queso fundido
Happy anniversary

JEFF
Happy anniversary

She rolls over and turns off her light Tonight is
obviously not going to be a romantic night

NEALY
What do you think if Friday we have a
nice romantic dinner by ourselves

JEFF
That sounds great

Cut to black for the MAIN TITLE

THE DETAILS

THAT NIGHT IN THE BACKYARD

Some colorful plastic toys lay about and low voltage
lights artfully illuminate the landscaping
And then from out of a tree by the fence a FAMILY OF
THREE RACCOONS make their way down into the light and
descend upon the lawn sniffing the grass

AT DAWN THE FRENCH DOORS THAT LOOK OUT AT THE LAWN OPEN

Jeff steps out in his sweatpants to check the weather
dismayed to find His new sod has been flipped over in
multiple places and little holes have been dug in the
dirt Also a few stepping stones have been overturned

JEFF
Nealy Come look out here

Half dressed Nealy comes out behind him

NEALY
Whoa What did this

MOMENTS LATER JEFF IS ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES

He puts each piece of grass back into its rightful place
He’s very patient moving methodically After a few
moments of this the Lang’s Latina Nanny ALMA comes out
with Luke in her arms

JEFF
Morning Alma Hey Luke
LUKE
Oh hi dad
ALMA

(South American accent)
What happened out here

THE RACOONS

AT AN UPSCALE HAIR SALON
Nealy’s regular STYLIST puts a smock over her chest

NEALY
Can you make me look ten years younger

The two women smile at each other warmly

NEW HAIRCUT NEALY COMES TO THE STOREFRONT OF HER STORE

A bouquet of roses waits for her by the door She picks
it up and reads the card I lust for your hot body
No addressee no signature She laughs then grows sober
as she unlocks the door and removes a hand drawn sign
Store will reopen at 2pm

INSIDE HER CHIC STORE

She walks through her showroom of furniture mirrors
candlestick holders bowls made of abalone shell

SHE SITS AT HER DESK REGARDS THE ROSES WRITES AN EMAIL

Jeff Meet you at home before dinner tonight ) Nealy

THAT NIGHT IN THE YMCA GYMNASIUM JEFF PLAYS BASEKETBALL

An intense five on five game A 66” black man LINCOLN
with a terribly scarred arm indented as if missing some
muscle encourages Jeff after he misses a shot

LINCOLN
Yo Doc that’s a good shot--keep shooting
that

RETURN TO THE LANG HOME LATER THAT NIGHT

Jeff enters drenched with sweat HOME DEPOT bag with
him Nealy’s on the couch REALITY TV on nice shoes
discarded on the floor They say hi then

JEFF
I got some Mountain Lion urine to scare
off the raccoons

He pulls a plastic jug of it from his HOME DEPOT bag

NEALY
Didn’t you already try Mountain Lion
urine

JEFF

That was Coyote urine

NEALY
What’s the difference

JEFF
Mountain Lions are higher on the food
chain than Coyotes

Never noticing her haircut or nice clothes he goes
IN THE BEDROOM

He discards his wet clothes She appears in the door
Naked he smiles at her and then

HE ENTERS THE BATHROOM AND TURNS ON THE SHOWER

Nealy sits on the bed and looks at the jug of GRANULATED
MOUNTAIN LION URINE

NEALY
You didn’t happen to pick up any toilet
paper on your way home did you

JEFF (0C)
What I can’t hear you

She enters THE BATHROOM and says loudly this time

NEALY
You didn’t happen to pick up any toilet
paper on your way home did you

JEFF
(pulls back shower curtain)
No are we out

NEALY
Yah

JEFF
Sorry babe

NEALY

You know it’s Friday night don’t you
Her disappointment is palpable He looks at her dumbly
NEALY (CONTD)
Well I’m going to have to have a bowel
movement at some point so I guess I’11
go to the store
She leaves Ducking back into the shower he puzzles
over what important day today could possibly be
IN THE PERSONAL HYGIENE AISLE AT THE LOCAL DRUGSTORE

She comes to a stop before a shelf of toilet paper
A FEW MOMENTS LATER SHE WAITS IN LINE WITH THE TP

As she waits she noticesIn the adjacent queue an ODD
INDIAN MAN smiles at herabout the 12 pack of butt
wipes she hugs Realizing this she tries to ignore him

OUTSIDE THE DRUGSTORE SHE GETS BACK IN HER PRIUS

Puts the toilet paper in the passenger’s seat Regards
it eyes glazing over PRELAP

JEFF (VO)
Nealy I totally spaced out about our
plans tonight

RETURN TO THEIR HOUSE

As Nealy shuts the door and strides to their bedroom and
into bathroom to place the toilet paper Jeff follows

JEFF (CONTD)
I was doing an emergency C-section all
afternoon I went to the gym to unwind
and it just totally slipped my mind

She discards her clothes and gets into bed
NEALY
I had Alma lined up to baby sit and she
had to turn down a date to do it

JEFF
I’m really sorry

NEALY
Don’t be it’s just the way it is

She turns off her bedside lamp and rolls over He turns
off his bedside lamp andafter a moment scoots to her

He runs his hands over her back trying to get a rise
But from where he lays she seems to be playing dead

Her eyes are open however and she’s waiting to see how
hard he’s going to try to make up for his blunder

JEFF
Hey

He kisses her on the shoulder She cracks a faint smile
but stays still
He waits for her to roll over To acknowledge she wants
him to keep kissing her

But she does not She’s still waiting for more effort
from him

However he’s not willing to try as hard as she would
like and finally

He exhales a breath of defeat and faces away from her
getting comfortable with his pillow

Then she rolls over and faces his back Runs her hands
over hima little And now it is he who is playing dead

And now it is he who is upset Who waits for her effort
And then she gives up Rolls away Her eyes searching

He remains facing away from her eyes searching also He
then gets up and goes

IN THEIR SHARED HOME OFFICE HE LOCKS THE DOOR

He sits before the computer and navigates to the
erotic section of CRAIGSLISTCOM W4M Types ‘erotic
massage’ Scans the list of titles that pop up One
that reads EBONY HANDS MAKE PEARLS gets his attention

He then CLICKS on EBONY HANDS and a sexy picture of a
BLACK WOMAN WITH HER SHIRT OFF fills frame He clicks on
the email link His work email pops up He signs on with
his password Then he types

Dear Ebony Hands

He pauses to think what to write next Looks at himself
in a nearby mirror Unbuttons his shirt a notch Looks

back at the screen Begins to type the rest of his email

A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE’S JACKING OFF

NEXT MORNING JEFF LOOKS OUT ONTO HIS BACKYARD TO FIND

His sod is all flipped over again Crap

A BIT LATER AS HE EXITS HIS HOUSE

He has a cardboard tube tucked under his arm
As he strides through his front yard we see it’s
overgrown with flowering shrubs and plants but no sod--so
in perfect order

As he goes to his Prius parked by Nealy’s matching Prius
he sees

In an empty lot across the street by a weathered FOR
SALE sign overgrown with bramble TWO TEENAGE BOYS
practice archery on a big target semi-permanently placed
there Their dirt bikes are laid by a big old hedge

AS JEFF DRIVES AFTER PASSING THE ARCHERS

LILA his neighbor early 40s hair mussed up in her
robe and sandals walks a little teacup TERRIER and
carries a WHITE CAT Lila lights up with big smiles when
she sees Jeff and waves

LILA
Morning Doctor Lang

Polite Jeff waves at her as he drives by
THE PRIUS DRIVES OFF DOWN THEIR SPARSELY POPULATED STREET

A desert suburb marked by cacti and patches of lawn

AS NEALY UNLOCKS HER STORE THAT MORNING
A BOY with a UNICEF box walks up to her

BOY
Excuse me Maam

NEALY
Yes

BOY
I go to Phoenix Christian Middle School
and as part of our eighth grade civics
project everybody’s raising money for
their favorite charity and I picked
Unicef because every year nearly ten
million children who live in poverty in
other countries die from preventable
diseases

He hands her a UNICEF pamphlet with a smiling heart-
melting AFRICAN BOY on the cover
A MOMENT LATER IN HER STORE

She writes UNICEF a thousand dollar check and hands it to
the boy for his box He looks at it and is astonished
Looks up at Nealy who looks preternaturally emotional

A TECHNICALITY

AN UGLY MUNICIPAL BUILDING STANDS IN A SUBURB OF PHOENIX
INSIDE AT THE WINDOW OF PERMITS and PLANNING

PLANS INSPECTOR
So according to these drawings you want
to expand your house here towards your
neighbor’s property here

JEFF
Right And raise the roof here in front
for a 2nd story loft with a skylight

PLANS INSPECTOR
Why

JEFF
Why Okay because my wife and I are
thinking about a second child and this
tiny room would make a great nursery
if we could push it out a few more feet

PLANS INSPECTOR
You do know you need to leave a five foot
pathway for the fire department don’t you

JEFF
If you’1ll notice where my neighbor’s
house is--see here--even with the
expansion we leave eleven feet which is
more than five feet on either side

PLANS INSPECTOR
Did an architect draw these for you

JEFF
No I did them

PLANS INSPECTOR
If you want to proceed with your current
plans you’1l have to file for a variance
hearing
(searches file cabinet hands
him a paper)
Here’s the form

AT THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL JEFF PARKS HIS PRIUS

As he strides to the entrance he puts on his lab coat

IN THE NEO NATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

Jeff walks to a NEWBORN in an incubator As he checks
the baby’s heart rate and temperature he ad libs some
sweet talk then makes a note in the baby’s chart

IN THE BACKYARD AT DUSK JEFF COMES OUT THE FRENCH DOORS

He carries a box labeled HAV-A-HEART--a humane animal
trap--and a bag from Kentucky Fried Chicken

He opens the box and pulls out a big wire cage Sets it
somewhere strategic near the kitchen door and glances at
the instruction manual

SAME LOCATION HOURS LATER IN THE DARK

A Raccoon comes and looks at the trap door considers
going inside for a piece of KFC chicken set inside
The raccoon thinks a moment then walks away

SAME LOCATION AT DAWN

The chicken leg is still there Jeff reaches into the
trap and pulls the bait out Examines it It’s pristine

He HUFFS as he sits on his butt and looks at his lawn

It’s as if the raccoons were somehow antagonized by the
trap Worse than before Muddy paw prints are all over
the steps of the French doorswhere Nealy stands

NEALY
We should just get rid of the grass and
put down some flagstone or something

JEFF
I don’t want to put down flagstone

NEALY
Why not

JEFF
Why not okay How about because I spent
my childhood playing in my mom’s
stairwell and my dad’s parking lot and
I’d really like it if Luke grew up with
a beautiful green lawn to play on

NEALY
If Luke has to play on flagstone instead
of sod it’s not going to scar him for
life

MOMENTS LATER JEFF FIXES THE SOD

He goes slow cares deeply for each little piece to make
sure it’s tucked back in place properly

ON ANOTHER DAY THE SOD LOOKS EVEN WORSE AND

Jeff gets sloppy and muddy as he starts to work more
furiously his beard grown out Wipes mud on his brow
Luke follows him around in his pajamas

LUKE
What’re you doing dad

JEFF
Fixing the grass my love

SOMETIME LATER SAME LOCATION

The trees have dropped leaves and the cacti has flowered
Now Jeff sprinkles handfuls of red hot Indian pepper from
an industrial size satchel on a patch of dirt before he
replaces the area with a fresh square of sod Nealy
stands by watching him work with a beer

JEFF
This stuff’s so hot it’s burning my skin
just touching it I doubt a raccoon’s
going to come back after he snorts up a
nose-full

NEALY
Assuming the pepper doesn’t work what do
you think of the idea of doing a series of
pocket gardens with pathways like we have in
front The raccoons never mess around in
front

JEFF
Let’s just give this a chance okay
IN BED SOME TIME LATER

Jeff searches for “Raccoon Extermination” on his laptop
while Nealy reads WHAT TO EXPECT THE TODDLER YEARS

JEFF
Here’s a guy who said he bought a Pit
Bull and left him outside at night to get
rid of his raccoons

NEALY
This is getting beyond boring

JEFF
I know we live in a desert there’s not
supposed to be grass I know

NEALY
I don’t feel like arguing about this five
times a week

JEFF
We just have to keep the raccoons away
long enough to let it root Once it
roots they won’t be able to turn it
over

NEALY
It’ll never root if the raccoons keep
disturbing the new roots will it

JEFF
Three thousand square feet of sod anda
new irrigation system was expensive and
you don’t just throw it away

NEALY
Don’t use that tone of voice with me

JEFF
I didn’t use any tone of voice with you

NEALY
Don’t deny using a tone of voice when
you used a tone of voice I’m not crazy
I know what I heard

JEFF
I never called you crazy
NEALY
You implied it though didn’t you
As if I’m not sane enough to judge
a tone of voice

JEFF
Maybe you are crazy

NEALY
Right now the truth comes out But you
wanna know the truth you’re the crazy
one Jeff

JEFF
Right of course I am

NEALY
»with your God damn racoons

JEFF
Glad we finally got to the bottom of it

NEALY
You’re so full of shit

JEFF
Am I full of shit or crazy

NEALY
Keep your fucking voice down Jeff-

JEFF
My fucking voice is down

NEALY
(overlap)
Don’t you dare wake up Luke

JEFF
You’re the one who’s screaming

NEALY
I’m not screaming

JEFF
Fine just spewing venom and being a
royal bitch

NEALY
Don’t stop now Jeff get it all out

JEFF
That’s just what you want isn’t it

NEALY
(overlap)
Yah that’s what I want

JEFF

You want me to say all kinds of awful
things so you can remind me of all the
awful things I said to you when you try
to force me to apologize at the end of
all this like I’m the crazy one so you
can abdicate every ounce of
responsibility you have in this fight

NEALY
(overlap)
Go fuck one of your raccoons

JEFF
More likely than fucking you

NEALY
FUCK YOU

SHE SCREAMS as she DECKS him in the eye

NEALY (CONTD)
Oh God

He stumbles as he clutches his eye After a brief moment
of shock she races out of the room

Eye swelling badly he sits in a nearby chair
A few moments later Nealy reappears with a bag of ice

NEALY (CONTD)
Jeff I didn’t mean to do that

JEFF
You just slugged me in the eye

NEALY
I know I totally lost my mind
You can hit me back if you want to

JEFF
I’m not going to hit you back

NEALY
Go on hit me--I deserve it

JEFF
I’m not going to hit you Nealy

He goes to the bathroom and shuts the door leaving her
She goes to the door

NEALY
Maybe we should talk about why that just
happened

IN THE BATHROOM JEFF SITS ON THE RIM OF THE TUB STEWS

JEFF
We had a ridiculous fight about raccoons--
that’s why it happened

NEALY
I mean why it really happened

JEFF
It happened because you got totally out
of control
(perfunctorily)
And I got out of control too

NEALY
All right
(but clearly it’s not)

Jeffs eyes search the bathroom ceiling as he
contemplates the nature of what just happened

AT THE OFFICE OF PLANS AND PERMITS

Jeff--terrible BLACK EYE now--waits in line to talk to
the PLANS INSPECTOR when his cell rings He sees it’s
Nealy calling and answers

JEFF
Hey

SPLIT TO NEALY IN THE KITCHEN WITH LUKE EATING BREAKFAST

NEALY
When I got up this morning and looked for
you on the couch you were already gone

JEFF
I wasn’t trying to be dramatic leaving so
early I had to stop by city hall this
morning before rounds to see what’s going
on with our variance request

NEALY
Okay

JEFF
I was thinking we could have a family
dinner tonight Talk then

NEALY
Sounds good

They both linger there in a brief silence for a moment

AND NOW HE ENTERS HIS MEDICAL SUITE’S PRIVATE OFFICE

He sits and starts up his computer He’s framed by his
Arizona College of Medicine diploma Mexican yarn
paintings depicting women in labor and an award from The
Board of Natural Childbirth

He enters his computer’s password and a photo of Luke and
Nealy is displayed as the desktop image He studies this

A BIT LATER HE ENTERS THE SHARED SINGLE OFFICE BATHROOMS

He washes his face examines his eye then gets a cold
compress from a little refrigerator which has several
labeled cups of urine in it He sits on the closed toilet
and ices his eye Fishes his sports coat for his cell and
dials a number from his address book

SPLIT SCREEN TO AN UPSCALE PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE WHERE

A very attractive woman REBECCA MAZONNI checks the
screen of her vibrating cell then answers

REBECCA
Jeffery Lang--I thought you might have
abandoned me

JEFF
Not yet Hey Rebecca

REBECCA
You and Nealy never invite us over anymore

JEFF
Yah we’re not very social these days

REBECCA
Liar Nealy doesn’t like me very much

JEFF
We have a two year old remember

REBECCA
Yes I remember

JEFF
Hows Pete

REBECCA
The same You sound sad what’s going on

JEFF
Nealy and I had a huge fight last night

REBECCA
So what’s new

JEFF
Ha ha

REBECCA
(delicately)
Was it about your sex life again

JEFF
No well sort of I guess but this was
something else

REBECCA
What

JEFF
It ended with her punching me in the eye

REBECCA
Jesus Jeff
(after a beat)
Has this happened before

JEFF
No I’m not a battered husband if that’s
what you mean

REBECCA
God Jeff I’m sorry

JEFF
I don’t know what’s wrong with us--it’s a
mess--the bad’s outweighing the good
you know what I mean--it’s all fucked up

REBECCA
Tell me how it started

As he thinks where to begin we cut to

JEFF AND NEALY AND LUKE AT A SALAD BAR THAT NIGHT
As they pile up salad items Luke is in Nealy’s arms

NEALY
So I want you to know I thought about it
all day and I decided to start seeing a
therapist again

JEFF
You don’t have to do that

NEALY
I hit you I need to talk to somebody
about this

JEFF

Why not talk to your friends

NEALY
Aren’t there things you’re too ashamed
to talk about with your friends

JEFF
If you feel therapy would help don’t let
my opinion about it stand in your way
Anyway I know how awful I must’ve
sounded when I said the thing about sex
with you versus the raccoons--so I know
I have my share of blame in the fight

NEALY
Thanks for saying that but I think we
both know this is deeper than one fight

They continue piling on salad items Not knowing how to
have this conversation

JEFF
Look obviously there’re a lot of
pressures on both of us but I think the
best thing we could do at this point is
put a moratorium on raising our voices
you know especially when Luke’s around--
I don’t want him growing up in the kind
of chaos I had to grow up in

NEALY
Neither do I

He gives her a forgiving squeeze She’s partially
relieved but only partially
AS THEY WAIT IN LINE TO HAVE THEIR SALADS WEIGHED

JEFF
So it turns out The Judge wouldn’t even
consider our variance request Apparently
it’s a bright red line no building in
the five foot zone

NEALY
Does that mean all our planning is down
the toilet

JEFF
Not necessarily--we can just go ahead
without a permit We live at the end of a
cul du sac --inspectors aren’t likely to
drive by I’d think the only way we could
get in trouble is if our neighbor
complained

NEALY
Our crazy neighbor you mean

JEFF
Right

Luke grabs tofu off Jeffs plate and throws it

NEALY
Hey Luke no

JEFF
Food’s for your mouth not the floor

Demonstrating Jeff puts a tomato into his mouth

NEALY
I don’t know maybe we should put a pin
in the remodel plan for a while It’s
too expensive for us anyway isn’t it

JEFF
If we’re really going to have a second
baby we’re going to want that space

NEALY
I know

JEFF
So we should do it before you get
pregnant--we won’t want the stress of the
construction to compound with the stress
of your pregnancy

(MORE )

JEFF (CONTD)
We’ll want to enjoy that time not manage
a construction crisis--maybe go on a trip
somewhere with Luke and relax before the
new storm comes in--know what I mean

NEALY
Yeah So what’s the worst case scenario
if our neighbor complains

JEFF
The city could send a demo crew and put a
lien on us for the bill

NEALY
That doesn’t sound so good

JEFF
Yah but it’s extremely unlikely Theyd
only do it if we were building something
dangerous or if a neighbor called the city
about it repeatedly and wouldn’t drop it

NEALY
I’ve got to admit the neighbor thing
makes me pretty nervous

JEFF
Let me deal with her

NEALY
How are you going to deal with her

JEFF
I haven’t formulated a plan on that yet

As their salads are weighed by the CASHIER Nealy cracks
a devilish smile

NEALY
I have an idea

JEFF
What

She whispers something crude into his ear and he laughs
Luke laughs too The vestiges of tension from last
night’s fight being mended here a bit more
THEY SIT IN A BOOTH AND START TO EAT THEIR SALADS
Nealy raises her Diet Coke

NEALY

Well here’s to a wild Friday night at
Souplantation

Luke raises his sippy cup Jeff his Heinekin

JEFF
Cheers

NEALY
Cheers

LUKE
Cheers

AT AN OUTDOOR NURSERY THE NEXT DAY
Jeff and Nealy browse some flowering cacti in fancy pots

NEALY
This one’s nice but it’s kind of
expensive

JEFF
Maybe we should accidentally leave on
the price tag

They smile at each other conspiratorially

IN THE INDOOR SUPPLY CENTER

Jeff walks to a display of wind chimes considering
something Then he starts picking off a dozen of them

AT THE REGISTER A FEW MOMENTS LATER
As Jeff sets the cactus and chimes before the CASHIER

JEFF
Can I ask you a question about raccoons

CASHIER
It’s one of my specialties actually

Nealy approaches with a houseplant she’s picked

JEFF
I’ve tried trapping them but they won’t
go in I’ve tried predator urine but
that just smelled bad and I even tried
putting hot pepper under the sod but
that did nothing

CASHIER
Do you have an automatic sprinkler
system

JEFF
Sure

CASHIER
What time does it come on and for how
long

JEFF

Around 3am for ten minutes

CASHIER
Well that right there is the most common
mistake people make with raccoons
A You’re way over watering the lawn
making it very hospitable for worms

INSERT JEFF’S POV ON HIS HAND PULLING BACK A PATCH OF SOD
TO REVEAL A BUNCH OF WORMS IN THE WET SOIL BENEATH

CASHIER (VO)
B Raccoons love to eat worms but if they
can’t find any they’1ll stop coming
C Worms like to drink water so if you
stop watering theyll stop coming

AS JEFF and NEALY DRIVE DOWNTOWN ESTABLISHING THE AREA

CASHIER (VO)
Now I’m not saying you should let your
grass dry out and die I’m saying youve
got to change your watering cycle to more
like 7am and reduce the duration to say
three minutes That’1ll give the water’1l
get a chance to evaporate during the day
and in theory the worms’1l have to dive
deeper for their drink out of reach of
your pesty nocturnal friends But don’t
expect instant results --the worms may
stick around for a while while your soil
desaturates I know it sounds really
simple but things usually are

IN THE BACKYARD A BIT LATER SLOWLY PULL WIDE AS

Jeff stands on a ladder hanging the wind-chimes all over
the tree where the raccoons like to enter the yard

JEFF
The raccoons come in this tree every
night Now we’ll hear them coming

Nealy sits on the steps outside their bedroom watching
Luke play replacing the price tag on the cactus putting
it somewhere where it might have been easily forgotten
JEFF (CONTD)
And I can run outside and scare the
living s-h-i-t out of them upon arrival
Trying to be generous Nealy nods

NEALY
I guess I’1ll buy some earplugs

LILA

JEFF WITH THE CACTUS RINGS HIS NEIGHBOR’S BELL

When the door opens Lila very disheveled weirdly
attractive has her white PUSSY CAT in her arms

LILA
Oh hi Doctor Lang how are you

Her little TERRIER growls in the distance

JEFF
I’m fine I just wanted to stop by-

LILA
(to the Terrier)
QUIET STEVEN
(back to Jeff)
Sorry

JEFF
So the reason I stopped by is were
thinking of doing a little home
improvement and I wanted to apologize in
advance for any inconvenience it might
cause you and to give you this as a token
of our appreciation

LILA
Wow what a beautiful plant such a
lovely stem and the flower Is this an
Arizona native

JEFF
I think so probably

LILA
Wonderful I’1l put it right next to my
bed Or no they say you’re not supposed
to put a cactus in the bedroom don’t they

JEFF
Who’s they

LILA
It’s Feng Shui Cactus in the bedroom is
supposed to be bad for the love life but
on the other side they say a bright red
flower is a good thing

JEFF
It’s a conundrum

LILA
(admires him a moment)
So what happened to your eye

JEFF
My eye oh I was at a Sports bar and
this drunk guy just decided he didn’t
like me I guess

LILA
You poor man

JEFF
Anyway I really hope we won’t disturb
you with our little project I know we
had a few issues in the past

LILA
(overlap)
Oh I’m sure I blew it out of proportion

She smiles at him reassuringly Admires his features
AFTER HE’S GONE SHE PUTS SOME HAPPY MUSIC ON THE STEREO

And she takes her plant around the house looking for the
perfect spot She’s obviously very high on the
interaction she just had with Jeff

SHE PLACES THE PLANT IN HER BEDROOM AND SMILES ABOUT IT

Then she goes to her vanity mirror above her dresser and
looks herself over That’s when her high starts to dip
And her eyes shift to see her cat Matthew on the bed
She goes to the bed and cuddles up to the cat stroking
him lovingly Obviously lonely as hell

IN THE LANG’S TINY FRONT BEDROOM

A BEEFY LATINO in plastic goggles rips the cord of a
chain saw The saw REVS

IN THE LANG’S PRISTINE LIVING ROOM

That saw comes through the wall and cuts a swath through
the existing plaster between two sconces

SAME LOCATION DAYS LATER

A gaping hole in the wall where a door will go reveals a
construction site beyond A LATINO CREW re-frames
everything with heavy beams to support the soon to be 2nd
story The far exterior wall is missing A saw BUZZES

JOSE (the beefy Latino) and Jeff (dressed for basketball
black eye healed) stand by watching

JOSE
You had a lot of termites in the old
beams we took out I think we should
call an exterminator before we close up
the new wall

JEFF
Why don’t we deal with that after The
faster this’s done the less likely it is
an inspector will stumble by and stop us

JOSE
You’re the boss

A BIT LATER JEFF ENTERS THE YMCA GYMNASIUM

Only one other player Lincoln (the one with the
grotesquely scarred right arm) is on the court

LINCOLN
Doc

JEFF
Hey Lincoln

Importantly Lincoln also has a little white bandage
taped to his left arm today and he’s wearing an Office
Depot work shirt with the name LEONARD embroidered

JEFF (CONTD)
Where is everyone

LINCOLN
Don’t know No one showed up yet

At the opposite end of the court a LATINO YMCA EMPLOYEE
stands on a ladder and fixes a new net onto an old rim

JEFF
Mind if I shoot around with you

LINCOLN
Heck no Doc

Lincoln is incredibly affable He passes Jeff the ball
Jeff shoots and it CLANKS out

sINCOLN (CONT’D)
I see your jump shot’s as pretty as ever

JEFF
You’re a sweetheart

sINCOLN
Why don’t we play some one on one

JEFF
If you need affirmation that badly

LINCOLN
You can start Doc

After Jeff misses the first shot Lincoln gets the
rebound steps back and drains his first jump shot

LINCOLN (CONTD)
So how’s the baby business

JEFF
It’s good How are things with you
Still working at that nightclub

LINCOLN
No I quit that a while back too much

strife I got a new job at Office Depot
and that’s been cool

Lincoln hits another shot Jeff brings him back the ball

JEFF
I was going to ask about your shirt but
I figured it was just a new style

LINCOLN

Nope I just forgot my workout shirt
today
JEFF
How come it says Leonard

LINCOLN
Because that’s my real name

Lincoln swishes another shot right through the net

LINCOLN (CONT’D)
Lincoln’s just a nick name my teammates
in college gave to me

JEFF
Why’d they name you Lincoln

LINCOLN

At first they called me Link actually
because when I joined the team they said
they no longer had a weak link in their
lineup and later on that became Lincoln
because they said I led them out of the
slavery of being a third place team

(another shot another swish)
Five to Zero Doc

JEFF
I guess it shouldn’t surprise me
I’ve always thought you played well
enough to be a Pro

LINCOLN
Used to but it wasn’t in the cards

Lincoln indicates his wounded arm as the reason

JEFF
What did happen to your arm I always
wondered

He shoots another shot and again nothing but net

LINCOLN
Well I’1l tell you when I was a freshman
we had a real good team--real good--three
guys on our squad eventually played in
the NBA

JEFF
Would I have heard of any of them

LINCOLN
Nope they all ended up being scrubs
(seems to enjoy that fact)
Anyway wed just won a real big game
(MORE)

LINCOLN (CONTD)
clinched our conference and I was the
high scorer It was a thing of beauty
On National TV and everything

JEFF
Amazing

LINCOLN
Pro scouts were all over me afterwards
it was like a real dream So me and my
boys were out celebrating that night and
we got a little stupid Doc stupid
drunk And guess what We got into a car
wreck

JEFF
Shit

LINCOLN
I nearly lost my arm that night But as
you see God was kind and let me keep it

JEFF
And you couldn’t play competitively after
that

LINCOLN

It took a year just to learn how to use a
fork and truth be told it was just too
hard on me to even try to compete after
that you know On the glass full side
that turned out to be the very last time
I ever tipped back a drink

Lincoln backs up and takes a long arcing shot and finally
one CLANKS out Jeff doesn’t bother to get the rebound

JEFF
That’s the saddest story I think I’ve
ever heard Lincoln

LINCOLN
Shoot Doc you must’ve not heard a lot of
stories then

Lincoln smiles his big improbable toothless smile
Jeffs eyes linger there on his cracked teeth

JEFF
Lincoln how come every other time I see
you here you have a bandage on your arm

AS JEFF USES HIS ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AND NEALY FLOSSES

NEALY
That is a sad story you’re right

JEFF
It gets sadder He’s always got these
pieces of gauze taped to his arm Turns
out the poor guy has kidney failure

NEALY
Jesus

JEFF
It’s funny how you can know a guy ina
certain context for so long--I mean I’ve
played ball with him for probably six
years now--but never really know him

JEFF (CONTD)
He has these terrible cracked teeth
I was thinking maybe I should pay for him
to go to the dentist but I don’t know how
Id ever broach the subject

NEALY
Maybe you could do something more
important for him than that

JEFF
More important like what

NEALY
Well if his passion is basketball
maybe you could talk to Ron’s sister
about that school she runs--maybe they
have a coaching job open or something

JEFF
You know that’s not a bad idea at all

AS SEEN FROM ACROSS THE STREET OUTSIDE NEALY’S SHOP

Some
Nealy

LATINOS unload a TRUCK and cart furniture inside

directs traffic When everyone is inside

A WELI

L-DRESSED MAN EXITS HIS BMW AND CROSSES THE STREET

And he enters Nealy’s store

NEALY
Yes turn it a little

IN NEALY’S STORE A BELL RINGS AS THE DOOR SWINGS

LATINO WORKER
Here

NEALY
Yes right there is fine

She takes pause on the MAN now before her--middle aged
big nose effeminate--as he flashes a warm secure smile

MAN
Hello Nealy You look gorgeous as usual

He has a British accent

NEALY
Hi Chris

CHRIS (MAN)
I came straight from the airport--what’s
this very important thing you emailed me
about

NEALY
Come in back

SHE ENTERS HER SMALL OFFICE AND HE FOLLOWS

NEALY (CONTD)
Chris look

CHRIS
Wait before you say anything there’s
something I’ve got to show you

He sets down his briefcase and puts his hands all over
her and kisses her passionately--which she melts into for
a moment until she backs away After a beat

NEALY
This can’t keep happening
CHRIS
So how are things here at the store
NEALY
Fine
CHRIS

What if I told you I’m in love with you
and I don’t know how to go on without you

NEALY
I’d say I’m in love with my husband

CHRIS
Last I heard he was a raccoon crazy moron

NEALY
I’m ashamed I said that to you

Chris steps closer puts his hands on her again trying
hard to maintain eye-contact with her

CHRIS
Hey I understand why you’d be ashamed--
but you were just being honest

NEALY
No I was venting

He notices those roses she received a while back in her
vase--totally dry now

CHRIS
If this has to end so urgently
why haven’t you thrown those out

NEALY
(conflicted)
It was an oversight

A FEW MOMENTS LATER CHRIS EXITS THE STORE

She follows him to the window and watches him go as the
LATINOS bring a chest of drawers inside and ask her where
to put it

IN LABOR and DELIVERY JEFF SCRUBS UP WITH RON CO-HOST OF
HIS ANNIVERSARY PARTY

JEFF
Is your sister still a Principal of that
Catholic school in the city

RON
St Augustine’s yeah

JEFF
They have a basketball team don’t they

RON
I think so Why

JEFF
I play ball with this guy--black guy
would’ve gone Pro if he hadn’t hurt
himself in a car accident in college--
probably one of the nicest people I ever
met--sadly wasting away working at
The Office Depot

RON
Why is that so sad

JEFF
I just thought he might make a tremendous
assistant coach or something if he was
given an opportunity

RON
There’re reasons guys like that don’t
find jobs like that on their own Jeff
How well do you really know him

JEFF
I’ve been shooting hoops with him for
nearly a decade--I’m telling you he’s
a great guy

RON
Okay

As Ron goes off to wherever he’s going he says

RON (CONTD)
I’ll text you my sister’s number

JEFF
Great thanks

THERAPY

IN NEALY’S STORE

Nealy sits at the register reading VOGUE when the bell
RINGS and she looks up to see

NEALY
Mer--what are you doing here

MERIDETH
I just came to see how my lady was doing
and see if you want to grab lunch

NEALY
Lunch sounds nice Store’s dead anyway

As Nealy writes a be back soon note

Meredith notices the story Nealy’s been reading in VOGUE
TEN WAYS TO KNOW IF YOURE DEPRESSED

She looks up at Nealy’s eyes and sees something’s wrong

MERIDETH
Are you reading that for a reason

NEALY
You don’t have a therapist to recommend
do you because I’ve met two so far and
I hated them both

MERIDETH
I thought you had a woman a few years back

NEALY
I did but she moved away

MERIDETH
What’s wrong

Nealy pauses ashamed Merideth waits

NEALY
If I tell you you won’t be able to talk
about it with Ron

WAITING IN LINE AT A TACO STAND THEY SPEAK QUIETLY

MERIDETH
When did you cut it off

NEALY
Well I guess I decided to the day after
the big hit--I was just so shocked with
myself I thought I’d better do something
right But he travels for business so
I didn’t actually do it till yesterday

AS THEY EAT THEIR TACOS AT A TABLE

MERIDETH
So was it just a sex thing or was it more

NEALY
I think it was just a sex thing

MERIDETH
You think

NEALY
I guess also the way he made me feel
before and after

These two old friends share a level look--Merideth knows
exactly what she means

NEALY (CONTD)
By the way it’s the only time in our
marriage I ever did anything like this
Not that that makes it any better

MERIDETH
Are you planning to tell Jeff

NEALY

Honestly I’m afraid if I did it would
end our marriage He works so hard to
make everything perfect I don’t know if
he could tolerate me screwing it all up

(after a beat)
You know what I’m afraid of the most If
Luke ever found out what a fuck up I was
I’d be so sick

MERIDETH
We’re not talking about telling Luke
he’s two years old we’re talking about
telling Jeff

NEALY

What about when he’s thirteen and he asks
his dad why he left his mom and Jeff
decides he has to be honest about it or
worse is honest about it because he hates
me

(after a beat)
This kid came by the store the other day
collecting money for Unicef and I gave
him a thousand dollars

MERIDETH
What does that have to do with anything

NEALY
I don’t know--I guess my guilt
I really need to find a good therapist

MERIDETH
If you ask me I think you and Jeff
should go into therapy together

NEALY
Wanna hear something sad that I never
told anyone
(off her look)
About three years ago Jeff and I got
into a huge fight

AS JEFF PARKS OUTSIDE OFFICE DEPOT AND ENTERS THE STORE

NEALY (VO)
I can’t even remember about what Anyway
afterwards I asked him to go into
therapy with me--and then we got into
another fight about that because he
associates therapy with being weak

AS JEFF SEARCHES THE AISLES OF OFFICE DEPOT

NEALY (VO)
He thinks therapists are all just whack-
jobs with degrees Then after that fight
we had make-up sex Sometimes we joke
Luke is our make-up sex child

JEFF FINALLY FINDS
Lincoln puts price tags on a box of new items

JEFF
Hey Link

LINCOLN
Doc No way what’re you doing here

JEFF
Looking for you actually

LINCOLN
Seriously

JEFF
Seriously

LINCOLN
What’s up

JEFF

Look I hope you won’t be offended about
what I’m about to say

LINCOLN
I don’t know what’re you about to say

JEFF
I took the liberty of contacting a friend
of a friend who runs a middle school--a
good school with a serious athletic
program Turns out a Coach over there
needs an assistant and the PE department
could use another staffer and they’d love
to interview you if you’re interested

Lincoln reels Jeff suddenly looks worried Then

LINCOLN
Doc I’m touched you didn’t have to do
that

JEFF

Does that mean you’1ll do the interview

LINCOLN
I’d love to do the interview Thank you

JEFF

One question--I’m embarrassed to ask
LINCOLN

Shoot
JEFF

You don’t have any kind of criminal
record do you Link

LINCOLN
No the law never caught up with me on
anything yet Doc

JEFF
Great Here here’s the coaches’ name and
number He’s expecting your call

LINCOLN
Thank you
(after a beat)
Doc you need anything from Office Depot
I can get you a real good deal

JEFF
No I don’t need anything
THE CONSTRUCTION ON THE LANG HOUSE IS IN FULL SWING
Jeff passes his Prius and waves at Jose who straddles a

beam on the 2nd story framing shouting to another WORKER
in Spanish for more screws

As Jeff enters his house he does not noticeIN LILA’S
HOUSE she watches from a window wincing every time
someone fires a nail gun BAM BAM BAM

THAT NIGHT IN THE BACKYARD

Lit up by the low voltage lights THREE RACCOONS navigate
down the trunk through the obstacle course of chimes
making noise

JUST THEN JEFF FLIES OUTSIDE

HISSING like a mad cat he throws his basketball shoes
and the raccoons run back up the tree out of sight He
waits a moment to see if they’1ll return

Then he goes to retrieve his shoes--out of sight fallen
behind a shrub He looks through the shrub and sees

A stray RACCOON hides near his Nikes lit up by the low
volts Staring at Jeff not making a move

JEFF
(keeping his voice down)
Go away GO

The Raccoon doesn’t budge So Jeff goes and gets his
hose and turns it on full blast Then he marches back
toward the bushes spraying until

That Raccoon runs offwith one of his Nikes

Jeff can hardly believe his eyes

THE NEXT MORNING AS THE FRENCH DOORS OPEN AGAIN

Jeff finds his sod torn up like never before And the
basketball shoe the raccoon ran off with last night has
been returned shredded in anger and left in the middle
of the lawn as a gift for him He picks it up Regards
it

JEFF
Jesus

TEN MINUTES LATER JEFF IS ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES

His yard is beginning to look more like The Monster of
Dr Frankenstein than a lawn from Better Homes and Gardens
To make matters worse his sprinklers come on and soak him

JEFF (CONTD)
Shit FUCK FUUUUUCK

A BIT LATER AS JEFF WALKS TO HIS PRIUS HE NOTICES

Those two TEENAGE ARCHERS ride their BMXs through the lot
where their target is racing across the desert field
toward the next street over--about a quarter mile away

IN HIS PRIUS

Jeff STARTS the car then is shocked by a KNOCK on the
windowIt’s Lila and her precious white cat MATTHEW

LILA
(after he rolls down window)
Sorry to bother you Dr Lang but when
your guys were sandblasting yesterday
a bunch of dust got into my house

JEFF
I told them to put up plastic over your
windows like you asked

LILA
They did but it must’ve gotten in through
the vents and now there’s dust everywhere

JEFF
Jeeze I’m really sorry about that

LILA
I noticed you’re expanding your front
room a little bit towards our house

JEFF
Right that room was a little small so
were moving it out a couple feet to make
the new nursery

LILA
I looked it up on the PCHD website--
the code is you have to leave a five foot
passage for the Fire Department

JEFF
We talked about this didn’t we
Your house is set back eight feet so even
after we’re finished we’ll have well
over ten feet--so it’s really just a
technicality not an actual safety issue

LILA
I guess Anyway the dust from the
sandblasting was really terrible
it got all over my windowsills

IN LILA’S HOUSE SHE TAKES HIM AROUND ON A DUST-TOUR
She’s a pack-rat the place is a mess

LILA
You can’t see the dust on the windowsills
because I spent hours cleaning them with
Windex and rags But you can see how
there’s all this on the TV here

She shows him the dust on the screen--it looks like
normal household dust attracted to the static cling of
the old screen She draws a line in it with her finger

LILA (CONTD)
I don’t know if you know this but I have
a condition that makes me very sensitive
to toxins and this is just very hard on
me with all this dust floating around

She eyes the sunlight where “the dust” rides the rays

LILA (CONTD)
I mean it’s everywhere See it
(after a beat)
Youre a doctor you’ve heard of
environmental illnesses

JEFF
Sure

LILA
That’s why I keep this basil leaf pinned
to my lapel
(wafting scent towards her)
It helps purify the air My Naprapath
recommended it--it’s really been a life-
saver

JEFF
Makes sense to me
(off her smile)
Well look I’m very happy to pay for a
cleaning service if you need it

LILA
That’s nice yeah but I called around
and one company said they’d charge like
three hundred dollars to send a crew and
it just seems so expensive

JEFF
I don’t care about the money Just give
me the bill and I’1l write you a check

LILA
That’s very kind of you

JEFF
Not at all Well I’1ll see you later

As he heads to her front door

LILA
So how’s your wife doing

JEFF
She’s good

LILA
And hows your little boy

JEFF
He’s doing really well thanks

LILA
That’s good I wish I had a little one

JEFF
Alright I’ve got to get to work

Jeff is halfway gone when

LILA
By the way I heard you trying to scare
away your raccoons last night

JEFF
Sorry about that

LILA
It’s okay I don’t really sleep anyway

JEFF
You don’t sleep

LILA
A few times a week I get a little
But I’m basically a night creature

JEFF
I could prescribe you something for that

LILA
Really

JEFF
Sure I’1l drop a prescription in your
mailbox tomorrow if you like

LILA
Yes thank you

JEFF
Okay Bye

LILA
Jeff I was going to mention the
raccoons don’t bother me because I poured
cement in my back area

JEFF
Yah they can’t dig up cement can they

LILA
It’s nice too because it’s easy to clean

The worst I ever get is a few gopher holes
in the side yard by the vegetable garden

SOMETIME LATER IN HIS PRIUS HE MAKES HIS GET AWAY

And he calls Jose on his cell phone

INTERCUT JOSE’S APARTMENT AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE

His TWO GIRLS eat Cheerios and his wife MARIA reads a
Spanish language newspaper Jose checks his RINGING cell

JOSE
Hey Jefe como estas

JEFF
Bien listen the pinche raccoons weren’‘t
scared off by the wind chimes-

JOSE
Yah I didn’t think they would be
Has the watering thing done anything yet

JEFF
Nope nothing yet

At a red light Jeff stops Eyes wandering to

A BILLBOARD FOR A STRIP CLUB A TEMPTING BUSTY BLONDE

JEFF (CONTD)
--SO I may want to try some of that
poison you were telling me about

He fixates on the strip club sign and doesn’t notice the
light turn green The driver behind HONKS

JOSE
Okay you got it

Jose hangs up then says to his wife MARIA

JOSE (CONTD)
(in Spanish with SUBTITLES)
Were going to poison Dr Langs raccoons

MARIA
(in Spanish with SUBTITLES)
Why cant they just try to coexist with
them

IN THE HOSPITAL THAT NIGHT JEFF STRIDES THROUGH THE
HALLWAYS OF LABOR AND DELIVERY STILL ON HIS CELL

JEFF
So she’s finally ready to deliver but
it’s going to be a late night Nothing
serious the mother has some meconium
Okay Tell Luke I love him Thanks Bye

AS HE COMES HOME THAT NIGHT

He finds a bottle of blue fluid and a can of tuna on the
doorstep with a note from Jose

HE POPS IN THE BEDROOM TO FIND
Nealy is awake reading After they say their hellos

JEFF
(re the poison in his hands)
You know what this is

NEALY
No idea

JEFF
The raccoon final solution One little
taste of this and it’s lights out for our
furry adversaries

NEALY
Don’t you think that’s a little cruel

JEFF
You realize we won’t have to discuss this
anymore when they’re dead

NEALY
There’re probably a thousand raccoons in
our neighborhood--what’re you going to
do slaughter them all

JEFF
There are only three raccoons that come
to our yard--they’re territorial--take
care of them and by the time any others
discover our property the sod will have
rooted

NEALY
Okay fine Kill them

She goes back to her book Though her words have been
acquiescent her tone has not This is not lost of Jeff

JEFF
Look I’‘ll try to control myself for now
and give the sprinkler idea more
of a chance to work Okay

NEALY
Okay That’s okay too
IN THE KITCHEN LATER HE MAKES HIMSELF SOME MINT TEA

And he puts the bottle of blue poison in a child proof
drawer filled with random junk

HE TAKES THE TEA INTO THE OFFICE and TURNS ON THE COMPUTER
As the computer comes to life he notices on the desk a
few of Nealy’s furniture-trade magazines (like some weve
seen in her office at work) On the cover of one is a very
sexy picture of a SUPER MODEL straddling a sexy couch

MOMENTS LATER

He surfs CRAIGSLISTORG again Scrolls down A LIST Stops
on 22 YEAR OLD HOTTIE WITH GREAT HANDS CLICKS on this

In the window that pops up there’s an image of a 22 YEAR
OLD HOTTIE--’CLICK TO SEE ME IN ACTION’ Jeff CLICKS and

A VIDEO OF THE 22 YEAR OLD HOTTIE STREAMS

22 YEAR OLD HOTTIE
Hi I’m certified in topless massage
and I will cum to you whereever you are
Sorry I can’t host but I have roommates
One hour sessions are three hundred
roses Email me if you’re serious FYI
I’m 420 friendly and I prefer mature men
Hope to hear from you soon Honey

Jeff stares at the screen Turned on Then clicks on the
email link His work email pops up He types his password

Then he writes And as he does he whispers

JEFF
Hi I too am 420 friendly ( but I can’t
host either So what do you think of the
idea of meeting in a bar for a drink
then me receiving my massage from you in
the bathroom Sincerely Big Jeff

He pauses on his letter enjoying it And just then his
cell phone on the desk RINGS He checks the number He
doesn’t look pleased He has no choice but to answer
JEFF (CONTD)
Hey Roxanne what’s upUgh How many
centimeters is she Bleeding profusely
He gets up and leaves the office still on the phone

WALKING TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR GRABBING HIS KEYS

JEFF (CONTD)
How profusely Okay

He grabs his briefcase and leaves the house
JEFF (CONTD)
Tell them I’1l be there in 20 minutes
IN THE HOSPITAL LABOR and DELIVERY PREP AREA

Jeff scrubs his hands and puts on latex gloves PRELAP
his cell phone RINGING again

IN THE HOSPITAL HALL A LABOR and DELIVERY DOOR SWINGS OPEN

Jeff strides out on his cell blood on his latex gloves
A WOMAN inside SCREAMS through a contraction

JEFF
So what’s the emergency

ON THE FRONT STEPS OF THE LANG HOUSE AT DAWN INTERCUT

NEALY
(very calm)
When I woke up this morning to make
coffee and check my email I had a bit of
a shock I guess you forgot to close your
work account before you left “Big Jeff”

A DEAD MAN is carted past Jeff just at this very moment

JEFF
(after a beat)
Nealy I know how this looks but I need
you to believe me when I tell you that
I was just fooling around on line
I wasn’t actually planning to meet her

NEALY
Please don’t lie to me

JEFF
I’m not But I’m here at the hospital
delivering a baby so it’s the worst
possible time to talk about this

NEALY
Are you sure you’re not at a bar

JEFF
Look as soon as I wrap things up here at
the hospital I’1l be home

NEALY
Okay

JEFF
Just until then please I want you to know
I was just bored in front of the computer

NEALY
Alright bye

LATER THAT AFTERNOON NEALY LAYS ON BED STARING OUT THE
FRENCH DOORS BACK TO US

Opposite in the doorway is Jeff Watching

JEFF
I guess you didn’t hear me come in

NEALY
(turns)
No I did

JEFF
Where’s Luke

NEALY
I dropped him off at your mother’s house

JEFF
Nealy I swear This emailing thing with
this girl was just a fantasy

NEALY
So youre saying you didn’t actually plan
to meet her

JEFF
Yes that’s what I’m saying

NEALY
What about the other women you’ve been
emailing

JEFF

(momentarily speechless)
So you read all my email

NEALY
Yeah I did a search by the words massage
and pussy and found a virtual library
(can hardly stop from
laughing)

JEFF
Okay well then did you read my email
thoroughly

NEALY
Of course--I couldn’t take my eyes off it
JEFF
Then you never read any emails where the
woman said “It was great finally meeting
you” or anything like that right

NEALY
True

JEFF
It’s like porn to me that’s all

NEALY
I wouldn’t care if I found a bunch of porn
in your closet I like porn but this
seems a little more advanced than that

JEFF
It’s just like interactive porn
It’s pen-pal bull-shit I’m telling you

NEALY
Tell me how it works

JEFF
How it works

NEALY
Describe the process of this
pen-pal bull-shit I want to know

JEFF
What you mean the details

NEALY
Yes the details

JEFF
Well I’m ashamed to say I’d be bored
You’d be nowhere to be found or asleep
And I’m a man you know I get horny
So I’d sit down at the computer and start
writing emails to whores dot com and
pretty soon I’d have a hard on

NEALY
And then what you’d jack off

JEFF
Yes

NEALY
And you never went to see them

JEFF
No Email then bail--that’s all I ever did

NEALY
You wrote some very creative emails

JEFF
You seem very entertained about all this

NEALY
My favorite was to The Chinese girl about
The Grapes

JEFF
Jesus

NEALY
You want me to do that to you

JEFF
God no-

NEALY
(generic Asian accent)
You sure Big Jeff-san I have grapes in
frigerator
They laugh out the tension then it returns She goes

IN THE KITCHEN SHE POURS HERSELF SOME WINE

Jeff enters Pours himself a glass too

IN THEIR BACKYARD LATER AT DUSK
They drink Bottle between them Quiet for a moment then

NEALY
Maybe this is a good thing

JEFF
You think

NEALY
Maybe it’s a chance for us to be honest
Me included

JEFF
Okay

NEALY
I think about going out and having sex
with other people too you know
She reels

JEFF
Of course you do you’re human

NEALY
I mean I’m 37 years old and I’m still
semi-attractive

JEFF
Don’t put yourself down you’re gorgeous

NEALY
I’m not putting myself down I’m just
trying to talk

JEFF
Sorry go on

NEALY
I’ve been thinking a lot about why we’ve
been so disconnected The truth is a lot
of it is my fault Jeff

JEFF
Of course it is It’s both our faults
We haven’t been connecting--it takes two
to Tango--we’re lazy

NEALY
This is bigger than that That’s what
I’m trying to say

JEFF
It’s not like I had an affair or something

She takes a moment
NEALY
Maybe this isn’t working Jeff Maybe we
should get divorced

JEFF
We’‘re in the middle of building a nursery

NEALY
Maybe it’s a mistake

JEFF
Please don’t say that

NEALY
Why not

JEFF

Because we can work this out

NEALY
How

JEFF
We could try having sex again for a start

NEALY
You don’t seriously think it’s that simple

JEFF
Maybe it is

NEALY
That’s naive

She stands goes back inside
IN THE BATHROOM SHE STARES AT HER REFLECTION UNTIL
He steps up behind her Very serious look on his face

NEALY (CONTD)
What

He cups her breasts and kisses her on the neck

NEALY (CONTD)
This is how you try to save our marriage

JEFF
Maybe I just want to fuck you

He pulls her pants down Squeezes her ass

She rolls away from him but he rolls to her They get
caught in the shower curtain

He kisses the back of her neck Tries to hug her close
and she slips away from him again back to the mirror and
sink where she washes her face

He comes up behind her again and drops his pants

He reaches between her legs And this time she doesn’t
stop him

She starts to get into it Soon she reaches behind
herself and helps put him inside her

They’re looking at each other in the mirror for a moment
but then this eye contact gets too intense and they go
into their own worlds as they continue

AFTERWARDS THEY SEPARATE AND PUT THEIR CLOTHES BACK ON

Not talking about what just happened Hardly in the same
room together

OUTSIDE THE LANG HOUSE THAT NIGHT

Lila walks into frame in a brown nightgown and furry
slippers She looks a bit like a raccoon as she bends
over and injects an envelope into The Lang’s mail slot

THE NEXT DAY JEFF KNOCKS ON LILA’S DOOR

She opens up smiling brightly Put together much more
attractively than he’s ever seen her before

LILA
Hey Jeff Fancy meeting you here

JEFF
I got your receipt from the cleaning
crew I came with a check

He hands it to her as an old fashioned TIMER BUZZES

LILA
Well your timing’s impeccable

JEFF
What do you mean

LILA
I have a surprise for you come on in

JEFF
Oh no I’ve got to get to work

LILA
It’ll only take a minute I insist

As she continues toward the kitchen he stops just inside
the door He notices all of her thousands of things are
now each in their rightful place

LILA (CONTD)
I was so inspired by how nice the house
looked I decided to do some baking

As she turns the corner into the kitchen Jeff notices
that she seems to unbutton her blouse one notch

LILA (0C) (CONT’D)
There were these really great looking
blueberries at the Farmer’s Market

Jeff notices her Terrier sunbathing by the window
Lila returns with a pie for Jeff

LILA (CONTD)
And I baked you a pie

With her blouse one notch unbuttoned her cleavage is
prominent--more eye catching than the pie

JEFF
You didn’t have to do that

LILA
It was my pleasure Cooking for someone
makes me feel really good And these
blueberries they were so beautiful--
I had to do something with them
Did you know that they’re a Super-food

JEFF
No I had no idea

LILA
Lots of antioxidants Anyway I hope you
like it The crust is gluten free which
means I didn’t use flour I used spelt

She looks into his eyes longingly And then he ad libs
his thanks and goodbye and lets himself out

LILA (CONTD)
By the way I’m sleeping much better
thanks to your mothers’ little helpers

JEFF
Great good to hear

LINCOLN WALKS THROUGH A SCHOOL HALL TO A COACH’S OFFICE

He stops and looks through a glass window on an old COACH
at his desk Lincoln knocks and takes a step backwards
Waits for the Coach to come open the door and greet him
(ad lib their hellos nice to meet yous etcetera)

IN A DELIVERY ROOM

JEFF
Push that’s it

THE SOON TO BE MOTHER bangs on the side of the bed

ANGLE ON THE LANG HOUSE IN THE MORNING

And the construction has moved along a bit Jose and his
crew are working as Nealy comes out goes to her car
SAME LOCATION A FEW NIGHTS LATER

The framing is finished on the 2nd story addition

A window has been installed A raccoon scurries across
the edge of the roof as Jeff drives up in his Prius

JEFF PEERS INTO HIS BEDROOM TO FIND NEALY SPRAWLED IN
BED THE LIGHT ON

JEFF
You awake

NEALY
No

She sleepily reaches for the lamp and darkens the room
Just then he hears WIND CHIMES
OUT IN HIS BACKYARD MOMENTS LATER
He comes out the kitchen door with a flashlight and
surveys the damage The racoons have already departed--
leaving a wave of mutilation Same old story
JEFF

Dirty little fucks
IN THE KITCHEN LATER
He washes the mud off his hands Then he opens that can
of tuna Jose dropped off and mixes it up with the poison

THE NEXT MORNING THE LAWN IS IN PERFECT ORDER

And the can of tuna is empty

Jeff looks around for a dead raccoon Spots none

IN HIS OFFICE AT THE HOSPITAL SOMETIME LATER

He swivels Stares out his window at the desert
A coyote trots by as he hears a DING from his computer

He swivels again Looks at his screen Sees
A new email from Honey69Yahoo NEVER HEARD BACK FROM U
He pauses on this a moment Then CLICKS on it reads it

ADVICE

IN A DARK DIVE BAR AFTER WORK
Jeff sits and has a drink whena sexy woman enters

wearing sunglasses Taking the glasses off we realize
it’s Rebecca--Jeffs friend he called when Nealy hit him

JEFF
Hey Rebecca Thanks for meeting me

REBECCA
Of course sweetie

They hug
A FEW MOMENTS LATER AS THEY BOTH DRINK
REBECCA (CONT’D)
So you said in your email you were in

trouble again

JEFF
Yes

REBECCA
What’s the subject

JEFF
Fidelity

REBECCA
Fidelity Aren’t I the wrong person to
ask

JEFF

You’ve had a lot of experience with the
subject
REBECCA
True

JEFF
So how do you and Pete manage given

REBECCA
Given my little problem
(off his nod)
He tries to make me behave by being
bigger and better than the others

JEFF
What do you mean

REBECCA
He takes human growth hormone to look
ripped He thinks if he looks sexy
enough I’1ll love him again

JEFF
Creepy

REBECCA
Last month I found a penis pump in the
mailbox

JEFF
A penis pump

REBECCA
Strange but true So tell me what’s going
on

JEFF
I’ve been emailing with girls on the
internet

REBECCA
You have seen ‘To Catch a Predator’ with
Stone Phillips haven’t you

JEFF
I’m not talking about teenage girls I’m
talking about sensual massage therapists

REBECCA
Whores you mean

JEFF
Whores yah

REBECCA
Don’t screw with prostitutes Jeff you
don’t want to bring STDs into the picture

JEFF
Presumably I’d use a condom Anyway
I don’t do it--I just get off on flirting
with them--though truthfully sometimes
I do think about meeting them

REBECCA
When was the last time you and Nealy had
sex

JEFF

Well we had make-up sex after she caught
me flirting on line with one of my
internet girls--hey don’t laugh--

REBECCA
Why not it’s funny isn’t it

JEFF
To you maybe

REBECCA
Sorry go on

JEFF
Anyway the sex started out great but
then after it was kind of disturbing--we
just lay in bed in silence And now two
weeks’ve passed and it’s just been the
same old story

REBECCA

Well two weeks is a millisecond compared
to the last time Peter and I did it

OUTSIDE THE BAR THEY COME OUT LAUGHING ABOUT SOMETHING

Each has stolen a tumbler of Whiskey

JEFF
Cheers

REBECCA
Do you think the bartender is on to us

JEFF
(opening his car)
Maybe we should make a quick getaway
REBECCA
You’re too buzzed to drive let’s just
walk around a while It’s nice out

Jeff nods and they keep going sipping their drinks

REBECCA (CONTD)
So what about your raccoons--still
driving you crazy

JEFF
I decided to poison them Do you think
that’s cruel

REBECCA
Not at all they’d just as soon poison
you if they could

JEFF
I wonder if that’s ever happened
Man killed by raccoon

REBECCA
Maybe you’1l be the first

JEFF
I was thinking about buying a gun and
camping out on my roof to shoot them

REBECCA
Sounds like a blast Pete has gun if you
want to borrow it

JEFF
Are you serious he has a gun

REBECCA
Yah swear to God you could blow your
varmints to Smithereens with it

JEFF
I’1l1 drink to that

A BIT LATER THEY ENTER REBECCA AND PETER’S HOUSE
JEFF
(setting down empty tumbler)

He’s at work

REBECCA
Until 2am every night

Jeff regards a framed photo of PETER--Rebecca’s husband --
giving a speech at a podium a MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK
DRIVING banner behind him

JEFF
What’s this

REBECCA
That’s Peter’s redemption speech for the
kid he ran over when he was drunk

JEFF
So let’s see this gun of his

REBECCA
Come on through here

THEY ENTER THE GARAGE AND
Jeff is drawn to a mint condition mint colored Alfa

JEFF
Mind if I get inside

REBECCA
Just don’t tell Pete It’s his precious

JEFF
Of course it is

IN THE ALFA

Jeff sits Feels the leather Notices the keys are in
the ignition Turns the key so the battery comes on

As Rebecca opens a lock-box in front of the car Jeff
flashes her with the brights mischievously

He then turns on the radio to find a THIS AMERICAN LIFE
about MEGAN KERRY a devout Catholic who donated her
kidney to save the life of a friend of hers--now lobbying
congress to legalize officially sanctioned organ sales

Jeff finds himself fascinated by this program as Rebecca
returns with a shiny silver gun and gets in next to him

REBECCA
Here it is

JEFF
Is it loaded
REBECCA
No I double checked

She hands it to him--he feels the weight of it

JEFF
You know I never held a gun before

REBECCA

Sure you have We shot guns together when

we were kids

JEFF
You’re making this up

REBECCA

No I’m not summer camp seventh grade

We all went to some farmer’s ranch

JEFF
It’s foggy

REBECCA

Speaking of foggy you want to smoke a

joint for old times sake

JEFF

Life of a psychotherapist So lucky
REBECCA

Am I lucky
JEFF

If you get called into the office for an
emergency all you have to do is talk to
your patient I get called in I might

have to operate

REBECCA
You could do a Cesarean stoned

JEFF

With one hand tied behind my back sure

She’s got the joint out of her purse by now

REBECCA
Smell it

She hands it to him He smells it Hands it

Shows him

back She

lights it Has a drag Offers it back to him

JEFF
(after a moment)
Screw it I’m 420 friendly

REBECCA
420 friendly

JEFF
(takes the joint)
420’s the hip slang these days for smoking
pot I’m surprised you don’t know about it

REBECCA
No one’s accused me of being hip for well
over a decade

JEFF
Honey said she was 420 friendly in her ad

REBECCA
Honey’s the erotic massage therapist your
wife caught you flirting with

JEFF
Yah--when they say they’re 420 friendly--
that’s when they really break my heart

REBECCA
Yah

JEFF
When I was a young man I used to love
screwing while stoned--I found it to be
very freeing Never happens anymore

Rebecca studies him admiring his features

Jeffs attention floats back to the interview of Megan
Kerry on THIS AMERICAN LIFE

Megans currently talking about how any of us could
donate a kidney and save someones life and be a hero

JEFF (CONTD)
There’s this guy I play basketball with
who needs a kidney Maybe I should give
him one of mine

REBECCA
Don’t be weird

JEFF
I guess that is a pretty weird thought

REBECCA
So howcome you never smoke pot and screw
anymore

JEFF

It makes Nealy paranoid--she’s been that
way since college ended

REBECCA
Right--I think I knew that Oh I have
an idea
(off his look)
Why don’t you take this bag home

She gets a bag from her purse and puts it in his jacket

REBECCA (CONTD)
»smoke pot in the bathroom crawl into
bed and seduce her

JEFF
She doesn’t like the smell of it in the
house--just that can make her uptight

REBECCA
Smoke it outside don’t even tell her

JEFF
She’d smell it on my breath

REBECCA
Haven’t you ever heard of Listerene

JEFF
Smoking weed and drinking Listerene
before sneaking into bed I don’t know
It sounds a little childish

REBECCA
So does flirting with a 420 friendly
sensual masseuse on line

JEFF
Guess so

REBECCA
You know maybe you should go see this
masseuse shake things up a little--I
think sometimes we get stuck in patterns--
trying to make our marriages work but
they don’t And you want to know why--
because underneath our nylons and our
Sportscoats we’re animals who don’t want
to be trapped

JEFF
Sounds pretty hopeless

REBECCA
Not if you feed the beast

JEFF
Not sure I follow

REBECCA
Maybe if you fucked this 420 friendly
bimbo it’d put you back in touch with
your inner animal and therefore your
inner animal feelings for Nealy

JEFF
Think so

REBECCA
(joint dangling)
Or you could start seeing some other
420 friendly woman See how that feels
She spreads her legs and her skirt rides up He notices

JEFF
Don’t fuck with me

REBECCA
I’m not

He looks at her now realizing she’s serious She then
leans to and kisses him on the mouth

He gives in a minute It’s frenetic passionate His
jacket comes off And then he breaks free--

JEFF
Hang on no

And he gets out of the Alfa She follows him
She takes off her shirt to reveal her tits--she’s hot

JEFF (CONTD)
What is this

REBECCA
Raccoon bait

He laughs She edges closer to him

JEFF
I tried to kiss you in tenth grade and
you rejected me Why the sudden turn
around

REBECCA
It has nothing to do with any rational
process I just suddenly feel like it

And then he goes for it They hit the tool shelf
SOMETIME LATER

They’re fucking on the hood of the Alfa punctuated by the
segue music of THIS AMERICAN LIFE

MEANWHILE IN LILA’S HOUSE

Tears stream down Lila’s face as she pages through the
phone book for the ASPCA Her terrier Steven lays in her
lap idle She calls and gets a RECORDING

ASPCA VOICEMAIL

LILA
(quivering)
Hello my name is Lilith Wasserman and
I’m calling about my cat Matthew

Eye’s searching she takes a brief pause

OUTSIDE REBECCA’S HOUSE JEFF EMERGES HEAD SPINNING

REBECCA
You want me to walk you back to your car

JEFF
No I’1l1 manage--thanks

REBECCA
Are we okay

JEFF
Of course we’re okay it’s my marriage
that’s in trouble

REBECCA
Don’t tell her--whatever you do
What’s done is done you can’t make it
better by being honest you can only make
it better by being better

This strikes him There is a long pause
JEFF
Alright

(he starts away)

REBECCA
Jeff wait

She hugs him goodbye They share a level look Then he
strides away in his white button down

Walking back to his car he is deep in thought staring at
the cracks of the cement
IN HIS PRIUS HE HANGS HIS HEAD A MOMENT

He looks up at his GPS and hits the ENTER DESTINATION
button He types in H-E-L-L and hits ENTER

HELL

As the GPS searches for HELL Jeff’s cell rings

JEFF
Hello

SPLIT TO LINCOLN OUTSIDE OFFICE DEPOT DRINKING A SODA

LINCOLN
Hey Doc

JEFF
Hey Link how’s it going

LINCOLN
I just called to let you know I did the
interview yesterday and I think it went
great

JEFF
That’s good news Really great

IN THE SHOWER THAT NIGHT

Jeff lets the water wash off his stink

GETTING OUT OF THE SHOWER

He looks at himself in the foggy mirror then finds a
bottle of Listerene and gargles Prelap WIND CHIMES
HE OPENS HIS EYES AND HE GETS OUT OF BED

Nealy is asleep He looks out the French Doors

The backyard is quiet No raccoons Just some wind
THEN HE GOES TO THE BATHROOM AND OPENS THE DOOR TO FIND

Scores of RACCOONS are inside all turning to face him

One is bathing in the sink water and above in the
mirror Jeff sees HIS FACE IS TURNING INTO THE FACE OF A
RACCOON MID-METAMORPHOSIS

AS HE HEADS TO HIS PRIUS THE NEXT MORNING

He’s obviously still tripped out He gets in his car

IN HIS CAR AS HE STARTS AWAY HE HEARS

LILA (0S)
Dr Lang

He looks in his rearview mirror to see

Lila dressed in all black eye liner running
handkerchief in her hand trying to wave him down

He pretends he hasn’t seen her--keeps driving
LILA STANDS WATCHING THE PRIUS DRIVE AWAY A MOMENT

Then she circles back to her own car--a side scraped
Honda--and she gets in and follows him

HE PARKS HIS PRIUS IN THE HOSPITAL LOT AND STRIDES IN

As he enters Lila’s Honda parks and she follows him

SHE WALKS FAST TO THE ELEVATOR AS JEFF GETS IN IT

But she misses it She hits the UP button and waits
Wiping her tearful eyes she smears her mascara

UPSTAIRS AS JEFF WALKS TO HIS OFFICE HE SLOWS SEEING

PETER MAZZONI--heavy bags under his innocent big blue
eyes wearing an almost-convincing hairpiece stocky--
stands by the door to Jeffs office

Pete holds Jeffs jacket--the one that came off in
Peter’s Alfa The one Jeff forgot

PETE
I think you left this in my car

A horrible silence comes over them

PETE (CONTD)
I found a receipt inside
(shows him)

Behind Jeff the elevator down the hall opens again and
Lila comes out--walks towards him Jeff none the wiser

PETE (CONTD)
Your name on it

As he hands the jacket to Jeff Lila grows within earshot

PETE (CONTD)
I knew my wife was a slut I just didn’t
know with who

JEFF
(opens mouth nothing comes)

PETE
Don’t say anything And please don’t
bother to lie

A few random people come walking down the hall toward
Jeffs eye-line making him self conscious

JEFF
You want to go in my office and keep
talking about this

PETE
There is no this Fuck you

He shoves Jeff with great ferocity Lila GASPS

Jeff hears her gasp and sees her there from where he
lands

He’s way too shocked to know how to address her presence
PETE (CONTD)
(to Lila)
Sorry Ma’am
And with that Pete strides away to the elevators
Lila glances back at Jeff then mysteriously she follows
Peter They both catch the next elevator
IN THE ELEVATOR GOING DOWN
Lila and Peter ride in silence Both afraid to look at
the other The elevator is CROWDED
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL

Lila and Peter go their separate ways

BACK IN THE HOSPITAL HALLWAY

Jeff paces a moment He calls Rebecca but gets her
VOICEMAIL as a PREGNANT COUPLE comes down the hall
waving politely Jeff does his best not to alarm them
with his anxiety He leaves no message for Rebecca

HE THEN ENTERS HIS MEDICAL SUITE AND

He strides past PREGNANT PEOPLE in his waiting room

IN HIS LAB HE FINDS SOME SAMPLES OF VALIUM AND

He laps down the pills from the faucet like an animal

HE ENTERS AN EXAM ROOM AND LOCKS THE DOOR

He lays down on an exam table and thinks

OUTSIDE LILA’S HOUSE AT DUSK JEFF RINGS THE BELL

A few moments later she opens up now wearing a dark
robe eyes terribly bloodshot They say hello then

JEFF
So I’m sorry you had to see that at my
office today I’m not sure really what
you actually overheard
(off her look)
Anyway can I ask what were you doing
there

LILA
There’s something I need to show you

She turns on her heels and leads him

INSIDE HER HOUSE

He follows her to the kitchen her little Terrier
Steven trailing He notices the place is in disarray
worse than ever

IN THE KITCHEN SHE STOPS BY THE REFRIGERATOR

She looks like she’s having a nervous breakdown

JEFF
What is it

LILA
Just look

She opens the refrigerator and he approaches to see

Her white cat Matthew in a shoe box by her tofu Dead

Jeff looks to Lila--not sure of his role in this yet

LILA (CONTD)
I brought his poor little dead body into
the 24-hour Pet Hospital and they did all
kinds of tests to see how he’d died

The horror hangs in the air a minute Lila starts to cry
hysterically and walks out of the kitchen

LILA (CONTD)
Oh God

He follows her as she WEEPS her way into her bedroom

LILA (CONTD)
It’s just so unfair he was so sweet

IN HER BEDROOM
She continues to cry He stands watching her helpless

LILA (CONTD)
He had this glow around him--he’d bring
me things Catch little lizards and
snakes and share them with me

Jeffs eyes drift to the red flower on the cactus he gave
her now the centerpiece of the bedroom

LILA (CONTD)
He’d sleep in my bed at night and wed
cuddle He was my baby

By now she’s sitting on her bed

LILA (CONTD)
I feel like killing myself you have no
idea Oh God I could really use a hug

Jeff falters then forces his body to span the gulf Sits
next to her embraces her and she cries on his shoulder

LILA (CONTD)
(after some sobbing)
Do you know Sonya Fitzpatrick

JEFF
No

LILA

She’s a pet medium on TV but she has a
private practice too We’ve been in touch
on and off over the years When my first
Yorkie Max died she gave me a lot of
comfort So when I finally found
Matthew’s body wedged like some kind of
debris caught between the garbage can and
the recycle bin I called her and do you
know what she said

(he waits)
He suffered for hours before he died and
all the time wondered where I was
Twitching and vomiting in terrible pain
stomach cramping violently

JEFF
I feel horrible that this happened

LILA
Of course you do because you poisoned him
trying to kill your raccoons

She looks in his ashamed eyes His momentary pause is all
she needs to know his absolute guilt

LILA (CONTD)
It’s okay I know you weren’t trying to
hurt him You were just thinking of your
family trying to make it nice and pretty
for them in your backyard you’re a good
man I know so generous So

She runs her hands over his shoulders craving his
comforts

LILA (CONTD)
Can I tell you a secret

Jeff nods perfunctorily wishing like hell he hadnt
entered her house

She then leans to his ear and whispers something to him
He freezes in abject horror

Then she starts to unbutton his shirt He’s like a deer
caught in headlights

LILA (CONTD)
Mrs Lang must’ve been very upset about
her sod getting messed up she probably
put a lot of pressure on you to fix the
problem

His shirt half unbuttoned she takes his hand and moves
it inside her robe onto her breast

She leans back and sighs a mixture of rapture and grief

JEFF
Lila I’m very sorry for your loss
(stands and gets space)
But no No I’m your neighbor for God’s
sake

Her face darkens fingers digging into an ornamental
pillow with some odd truism stitched into it

JEFF (CONTD)
I’m married to a woman you live next door
to

LILA
You forgot to mention that I disgust you

JEFF
LILA
Don’t lie to me just say it

JEFF
That’s not it

LILA
YOURE A FUCKING LIAR AND A CHEATER

She says as she suddenly flails about the room with her
pillow and knocks over the cactus he gave her

LILA (CONTD)

HOW DARE YOU GET ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY ON
ME -- YOU’RE A DIRTY PHILANDERER AND
STUPID TOO LEAVING CLUES AROUND LIKE YOU
WANT TO GET CAUGHT CARELESS CARELESS
CARELESS DO YOU WANT TO GET CAUGHT
(takes it down a notch)

MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET CAUGHT MAYBE I
SHOULD JUST RUN INTO THE STREET AND
SCREAM IT OUT FOR ALL THE WORLD TO HEAR
ABOUT HOW YOU’RE A CHEATING CAT KILLING
LIAR

She bashes a few more things and then calms for a moment

LILA (CONTD)
You know it’s a crime to poison wildlife
in this state statute 13-2910 You could
go to jail for up to six months

(a moment passes)

I don’t know what to do here
I’m feeling very Swimmy
Swimmy with death and saw dust and power
hammers in the middle of the night

JEFF
Lila we haven’t been doing construction
at night

LILA

How would I know when you gave me those
fucking sleeping pills to dope me

She catches sight of her crazy face in the mirror and it
gives her pause

LILA (CONTD)
Excuse me

She goes He stays Then decides to leave her bedroom
IN THE LIVING ROOM
He finds her pouring herself some water from a pitcher

LILA (CONTD)
I’m so sorry Doctor Lang I didn’t mean
to shout at you back there
I think I’m just so upset about my
Matthew it’s really put me through the
ringer

JEFF
I completely understand

LILA
I’m just such a mess Do you think you
could ever forgive me

JEFF
Consider it done

LILA
You’re such a kind man I really don’t
deserve your kindness

JEFF
Everyone deserves some kindness

She turns and faces him

LILA

Jeff do you believe in past lives
JEFF

Not really
LILA

I don’t really either I mean it doesn’t
really make sense that somehow the soul
migrates from one time to another

JEFF
Right

LILA
But then again I had a funny dream a few
nights ago that you and I lived nearby
each other in the countryside in England--
there were no cars we rode horses around
everywhere Mine was a white Stallion
he loved to gallop

(MORE)

LILA (CONTD)
Anyway even though we were only
neighbors let’s just say our destines
were intertwined Funny thing is in
this dream I had you made me really
angry about something and I screamed at
you like I did just now But then the
way I made it up to you

She blushes By now she is very close to him again and he
is getting really nervous

LILA (CONTD)
That was really something

(off his look)
If you’d like me to show you what I did
you don’t even have to agree for me to do
it just don’t disagree and it’ll be
like you didn’t do anything at all I’‘1l
do everything and youll just be here

He’s so frightened to engender her anger again he
freezes as she slides her hands down his torso

LILA (CONTD)
I don’t want to get you in trouble

She then unbuckles his belt as she looks at his eyes
And then she starts to try to get him hard with her hand

She continues to look into his eyes but can not see just
how insanely uncomfortable he is

LILA (CONTD)
(overlap)
Come on come on

And then--despite the awkwardness of all this--he can’t
help himself--he starts to get hard

LILA (CONTD)
(smiles )
Yah here you are

And then she drops down onto her knees and begins to suck
his cock

Though his pleasure is mixed with revulsion his
revulsion is outweighed by what’s happening to his cock
It feels good Too good

And he lets loose a SIGH of pleasure

Hearing this she looks up at him and giggles like a
child

She then gets up and pushes him into a chair opens her
robe and gets on top of him Robe draped over his legs
she helps him inside her and

She starts fucking him with lots of EXCITED VOCALIZATIONS
After a bunch of intense thrusts Jeff loses control

JEFF
Lila hang on

LILA
No I want you inside me

JEFF
But I’m going to-

LILA
COME INSIDE ME DO IT (ad 1ib)

He has no choice save for throwing her off of him She
presses even harder Then HE COMES and she laughs crazily

Then she hops off of him and pulls her dress back down
He pulls up his pants and buckles his belt as

She finds some clove cigarettes and lights one

LILA (CONTD)
Want one they’re cloves

He takes one and lights it Smokes it with her ina
thick strangely intimate silence

WALKING BACK TO HIS HOUSE MOMENTS LATER IN THE DARK

He calls Rebecca again Gets her VOICE MAIL again as he
passes his Prius parked behind Nealy’s in the driveway

JEFF
Rebecca it’s Jeff trying again
Please call me back

AT HOME AS HE ENTERS HE PUTS ON A HAPPY FACE

He finds Nealy in the living room eating Chinese THE
WONDERPETS are on TV and Luke holds the remote

JEFF
Hey guys

LUKE
Oh hi dad

NEALY
Hey I heard you pull up then where did
you go

JEFF

Just dealing with our crazy neighbor--
she’s upset about the construction

NEALY
Did you calm her down

JEFF
Yes Oh I love this show

Jeff tickles Luke until he LAUGHS

JEFF (CONTD)
I love love love this show

Jeff then walks into the kitchen expression darkening as
Luke aims the remote to turn up the TV

IN THE KICTHEN

Jeff makes himself a plate of food Nealy comes in with
her dirty dish as the VOLUME OF THE WONDERPETS goes up

NEALY
Peter Mazzoni stopped by the house today

JEFF
He did

NEALY
Yah he said he’d like you to come by the
restaurant tomorrow to discuss some
business deal you two are working on

JEFF
Oh

NEALY
What was he talking about

JEFF
Right He’s trying to get me to invest in
his new restaurant but I don’t know

NEALY
Hmm He’s wildly successful at it--maybe
we should

The Wonderpets show is very loud now-

NEALY (CONTD)
LUKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE

THAT NIGHT JEFF COMES OUT OF HIS FRENCH DOORS
Alone in sweatpants and a t-shirt he shuts the French

doors on the darkened bedroom and sits on the steps that
look down on his patchwork of sod He broods

THE NEXT DAY JEFF ENTERS MAZZONI’S POPULAR RESTAURANT
HE FOLLOWS A HOSTESS TO THE BACK

--past all the well to do CUSTOMERS

THROUGH THE BUSY KITCHEN

--past all the LATINO COOKS AND DISHWASHERS

INTO PETE’S OFFICE

where Pete is on a phone call

HOSTESS
Friend of yours to see you

Pete nods and The Hostess leaves Pete indicates Jeff
should sit as he finishes his call He takes his time
with the call (ad lib) as if to draw out the tension for
Jeff Then he hangs up

PETE
Afternoon Jeffery

JEFF
So you stopped by my house last night

PETE
That’s right there’s no restraining
order on me yet is there

JEFF
No So what do you want

PETE
What do I want Well I want to fuck your
wife up the ass while your two year old
watches me hack you into little bits
but I’ve decided not to do it

JEFF
Very decent of you
PETE

Instead I’m going to offer you a choice
predicated on the fact that you’d prefer
me not to tell the world what you did so
as to preserve your reputation and your
marriage which I am told you do value

I want two hundred thousand dollars in
cash for my silence

Jeff lets slip an anxious laugh and rubs his face

JEFF
Youre rich--you don’t need my money

PETE
No but you do
LATER REBECCA OPENS HER OFFICE DOOR

She’s smoking a cigarette looking wrecked

JEFF
I’ve been calling and calling-
REBECCA
I’m sorry I’ve been here--I’m sorry--
(reentering)

I havent been answering

A BIT LATER INSIDE SHE POURS THEM BOTH A DRINK

JEFF
So what do you think

REBECCA
I think he’s a mean spirited Italian
who grew up in the projects in New Jersey
and he takes a lot of pride in backing up
his threats but if I were you I’d call
his bluff If he’s not bluffing your
wife finds out you cheated on her once
End of story

JEFF
She’d leave me if she knew what happened

REBECCA
If she leaves you over this then you
weren’t meant to be together

JEFF
I think I just figured out where my
aversion to therapists comes from

REBECCA
Well then maybe you should just get
divorced that way Peter won’t have any
leverage over you

JEFF
Don’t be so glib

REBECCA
Sorry

JEFF

Maybe you can’t understand this because
you and Pete decided not to have a child
together thank God but I don’t want to
only be allowed to see my son on weekends
and I sure as hell don’t want Luke to
wake up one morning when he’s sixteen to
realize he hardly even knows his father

REBECCA
You hardly knew your father because he
was a remote person who moved to another
city That’s not going to ever happen
between you and Luke because you’re not
going to let it

JEFF
Yes that’s right and that starts with
me not ruining my marriage with my wife
REBECCA
Okay so then you have all the answers and

you know what to do--pay him the money--
why come to see me

JEFF
For a cigarette I guess

She gives him one and they smoke together in silence

Until he gets frustrated and suddenly with his fist he
pounds the coffee table

CUT TO

JEFF TAKING A VIOLENT ELBOW IN THE FOREHEAD

WIDEN ON THE YMCA BASKETBALL COURT DURING A 5 ON 5 GAME

JEFF
Keep your damn elbows down would you

Lincoln and Jeff on the same team Jeff chases THE GUY
who just threw his elbow to play defense against him

As the shot comes off the rim Jeff gets boxed out hard
on a rebound by THE GUY who just threw his elbow Lincoln
gets the rebound

Jeff runs to the offensive end and tries to post up But
as he receives the ball from Link The Guy swats him
across the forearms Then Jeff snaps and pushes The Guy

JEFF (CONTD)
Try going for the fucking ball

The Guy pushes Jeff back

THE GUY
You don’t know me so don’t fuck with me

LINCOLN
Whoa cool out Both of you

Lincoln separates them

WALKING TO THE BENCH AFTER THE GAME

LINCOLN (CONTD)
Doc you can’t let a guy like that get
in your head That’s what he wants

JEFF
I don’t know what got into me

LINCOLN
There ain’t no sense in making basketball
a screaming match even if your life
makes you want to scream Basketball’s
supposed to be fun know what I’m saying

JEFF
You have a really good attitude
I really hope they give you the coaching
job--you’1l be a great coach

LINCOLN
Fingers crossed

Jeff looks at Lincoln his head-space altered a moment
then Lincoln’s digital watch BEEPS He turns it off

LINCOLN (CONTD)

Welp I gotta go get the blood filtered

(stands)

You have a good one
Lincoln offers Jeff a fist bump and Jeff gives him one
Jeff watches him walk off lost in Link’s world a moment
After he’s gone the anxiety of his own world rushes
back He sits there a few more moments Freaked out
IN HIS HOME OFFICE IN FRONT OF HIS COMPUTER
He enters the password for his ONLINE BANK He looks at
the total balance 18906341

LATER NEALY COOKS DINNER WHILE JEFF LEANS AGAINST THE
COUNTER DRINKING A BEER

Luke plays on the floor with some toys

NEALY
How was basketball tonight

JEFF
Fine

NEALY
Did you end up meeting with Peter today

JEFF
Yah

NEALY
Just yah

He looks at her in her eyes searching for courage

JEFF
Nealy

NEALY
What

He looks back at Luke Pauses

NEALY (CONTD)
Did you want to say something

JEFF
I was just thinking about how lucky we
are to have such a sweet natured child
together

NEALY
I know I think that every day

WALKING OUT OF HIS BANK JEFF MAKES A CELL PHONE CALL

JEFF
(carrying a briefcase)
Hi it’s Jeff I’ve got the money but
only a hundred grand I’1l explain when
I meet you Okay okay Where
Why there

ON A REMOTE SUSPENSION BRIDGE THAT SPANS OVER A RIVER

Jeff waits with his briefcase He checks his watch

A lone TRUCK drives by but otherwise there’s absolutely
no traffic out here on this two lane desert highway
His Prius is parked on the shoulder

Then he hears a WHISTLE behind him He turns sees

Pete walks into view at the end of the bridge--waving

Alone

Dark sunglasses In a black suit

Jeff waits for him to arrive Peter walks slowly as if
purposefully trying to draw out the tension

And finallyhe’s there

He’s sweating profusely He takes off his sunglasses and
we see he’s badly sunburned except where his glasses

were

This has made him look a bit like a raccoon

JEFF
Where’s your car

PETE
I walked

JEFF
You walked

PETE

Yah So

JEFF
So I’m sorry I couldn’t get it all--my
wife uses our bank account regularly but
she never pays any attention to our
investment portfolio so I liquidated
everything we had in that

PETE
It’s okay What you brought’1ll work

Jeff passes him the briefcase Pete opens it and looks
at all the hundreds-—-loose not in bundles

PETE (CONTD)
You ever see a beaver dam made of hundred
dollar bills

JEFF
I don’t know what you’re talking about

PETE
Or maybe an eddy of Benjamin Franklins
swirling by the shore

Pete observes Jeffs puzzled look and then shakes out
Jeffs briefcase over the bridge and--as Jeff gasps and
looks over the rail

All the money flutters down like a thousand green leafs
into the slow current below

JEFF
(after a beat)
What’d you do that for

Pete enjoys Jeff’s shock Hands back his empty briefcase

PETE
I did it to show you what kind of man
I am See unlike you I’m not the kind
of man who runs around fucking other
peoples’ wives and ruining their
marriages By the way Becca and I are
done and I’m taking everything she’s got
with our prenup I’m sure she’1l be
pretty desperate for a shoulder to cry on
so feel free to go take advantage and
poke around in that cum hole all you
want I don’t care anymore

Pete takes a step away full of rage trying to contain
himself Then
He shows him--wants to use it so badly

PETE (CONTD)
I gave you a choice Jeffrey--you coulda
just told your wife the truth instead of

meeting me here--you
guy but no you’re a
wife
fucking rat piece of
her I don’t deserve

coulda been a good
rat just like my

But you see Jeffery I’m nota

shit like you and
what I’ve been

dealt But you you deserve a lot worse
than losing some petty cash to the
Colorado river Truthfully a rat shit

like you deserves to

be shot full of

holes and dumped over the bridge with
your money I could do that I have a

gun

PETE (CONTD)
But that’s not what I’m going to do No

He chucks the gun over the bridge into the water

He starts away in the opposite direction he came from

Jeff stays exactly where he is paralyzed
He looks at the screen

RINGS

PETE (CONTD)

No I’m no murderer

I’m the kind of man

who makes a mistake and makes amends with

my past
into a drunk driving
killed a kid but did
lawyer to get me off
I was just under the
I went to Church and
forgiveness and pled

I’m the kind of man who got

accident and nearly
I hire a fancy
Scott-free because
legal limit No
prayed for

guilty and after the

Judge ordered me to pay the kid’s family

a million dollars in

damages and sent me

to prison for a month --did I stop there
No I started volunteering Philanthropy

Jeffery That’s the

kind of man I am

You wish you were that kind of man
But you’re not you’re just a home-

wrecker scum-bag

But don’t worry baby
I won’t wreck your home

No doubt you’1l

do that all on your own

JEFF
Hey babe

NEALY

Answers

You haven’t seen my keys around have you

Decides not to

Then his cell

SCREEN SPLITS TO NEALY MOVING ABOUT THEIR HOUSE
Looking under every pillow of the couch etc

JEFF
No I have no idea

She’s frantic lifting up a rug as if they could have
made it under there somehow

NEALY
Shit I don’t know what I’m going to do

JEFF
Have you looked in the diaper bag

As he talks with her totally shell-shocked he looks
downstream at the river gorge below

The money floats away far away down below in the river
gorge irretrievable

NEALY
Of course I looked in the diaper bag
Are you sure you didn’t take them

JEFF
Yes What about Luke’s toy box remember
when he hid the remote in there

NEALY
Good idea Hang on
(beat)
No not here

JEFF
Wish I could help you babe

NEALY
It’s alright I’1l keep looking

She hangs up and
HER SIDE OF THE SPLIT GOES AWAY AND

He stands there alone on the bridge for a few more
moments His ears still ringing with Peter’s words

He hits himself in the head multiple times Looks back
out at the expansive river twisting into the distance

THAT NIGHT WHILE NEALY GIVES LUKE A BATH
Jeff stands in the doorway and watches very emotional

Nealy turns and looks at him unsure what he’s doing

ALSO THAT NIGHT IN THE DARKENED BEDROOM

Jeff sits in a chair near the bed wide awake as Nealy
sleeps It’s 312 am

He regards Nealy--she looks peaceful in the dim light

THE NEXT DAY JEFF IS SITTING IN HIS TORN UP BACKYARD

His eyes are bloodshot with worry when his phone RINGS
He checks to see who’s calling RESTRICTED He answers

JEFF
Hello

SPLIT TO LINCOLN IS HOOKED TO A DIALYSIS MACHINE
He’s calling Jeff from a house phone in the hospital

LINCOLN
Doc it’s Link

JEFF
Hey Lincoln

LINCOLN
What’re you up to

JEFF
I have the day off I was just kind of
sitting around

LINCOLN
So guess what

JEFF
What

LINCOLN
I got the job

JEFF
No kidding that’s wonderful

LINCOLN
Youre telling me We need to celebrate

Something starts BEEPING loudly on the dialysis machine

JEFF
What’s that

LINCOLN
Oh I’m all tied up to my dialysis
machine for the next couple hours
Damn thing just starts beeping for no
reason sometimes

JEFF
What hospital are you at

LINCOLN
Phoenix Memorial why

JEFF PARKS IN THE VISITOR LOT OF PHOENIX MEMORIAL
INSIDE HE ENTERS THE DIALYSIS TREATMENT WING

And he spots Lincoln is down the hall one of about
TWENTY PATIENTS of varying degrees of health getting
their treatments across from one another

JEFF
(as he approaches)
Hey

LINCOLN
Doc pull up a chair

Jeff sits by his side Lincoln mutes the small TV
attached to his dialysis machine

LINCOLN (CONT’D)
Thanks for visiting I never get
visitors here and that old man across the
way ain’t very entertaining

ON A DIALYSIS MACHINE ACROSS THE WAY

A BLACK MAN about his own age but sick as could be--skin
and bones--sends up a middle finger with a wry smile

LINCOLN (CONTD)
He knows I’m just playing Jeff meet
Horace My basketball buddy my dialysis
buddy

Jeff goes and shakes HORACE’S hand

HORACE
Pleased to meet you

JEFF
Nice meeting you too

Jeff sits back down and looks at Lincoln--at all the
tubes going in and out of his veins

JEFF (CONTD)
So who’s your doctor here

LINCOLN

William Budge ever hear of him
JEFF

No
LINCOLN

Seems like a good enough guy

JEFF
What does he say in terms of how long
before your kidneys fail

LINCOLN
I’ve been in end stage renal disease for
over four years and the fact is average
life expectancy of a forty year old black
man once he has ESRD is about six years
But the way I see it if God could create
the earth in seven days why can’t I get
lucky and find me a kidney in two years

Jeff thinks it over

LINCOLN (CONT’D)

Hey Doc I hope I didn’t just depress the
hell out of you with that This is a
good day you know

JEFF
I know

To Lincoln Jeff looks overly effected by all the
suffering here by Horace across the way

LINCOLN
Anyway I believe the old saying it’s
always darkest before the dawn
(MORE)

LINCOLN (CONTD)
It’s a saying because it turns out to be
true all the time and that’s why it gets
said so much you know what I mean Ah
come on now Doc Your eyes are all
glassy like you’re gonna cry on me
Don’t you dare cry on me

THE KIND OF MAN WHO MAKES A MISTAKE AND MAKES AMENDS

STARING AT HIS COMPUTER SCREEN AT WORK

Jeffs eyes continue to glaze over with water as he
fixates on a cheery web-site about kidney donation

IN A THERAPISTS WAITING ROOM

Nealy sits reading GLAMOR magazine A story titled TEN
WAYS TO FIX A BROKEN MARRIAGE 1 PLAN A FANTASY
VACATION TOGETHER 2 DO SOMETHING IDEALISTIC TOGETHER

She looks up as another FEMALE PATIENT emerges from the
inner office and walks out the front door

IN A THERAPISTS OFFICE A BIT LATER
Nealy sits opposite a middle aged woman REGINE ROSSEAU

NEALY
In the Glamor magazine in your waiting
room there’s a story about how to fix a
broken marriage--one of the ideas was for
the couple to do something idealistic
together Is that crazy

REGINE

Not crazy at all I suggest doing things
like that to my patients in marital
crises all the time Doing good external
things can lead to internal changes
there’s no doubt about it But you need
to be clear about what you desire those
internal changes to be

NEALY
What do you mean

REGINE

I mean you and your husband probably need
to address the internal-emotional
frustrations that brought you to the
point you’re at now or else in all
probability the cycle you’re in will just
go on and on

(after a beat)
Can you tell me what you love about your
husband

She searches herself for her thoughts

REGINE (CONTD)
Or maybe it’s easier to tell me why you
fell in love with him in the first place

NEALY
We met in college I’d seen him around
for about a year before we ever spoke
I always thought he was incredibly cute
and then we finally met at a party
We talked for about an hour about
everything under the sun and the next
night we went on a date--we saw a movie--
he picked--a chick flick to make me
happy I’m sure--and anyway afterwards
it was late and we were hungry and the
only place that was open was Denny’s
But when we sat down and looked at the
pictures on the menu we lost our appetite
and we decided we didn’t really want to
eat there But the waitress had already
brought us ice water So he left her a
two dollar tip just for that He didn’t
have to and I don’t know maybe he was
just trying to impress me with staged
generosity but still I just fell in
love with him on the spot hook line and
sinker

IN LINCOLN’S BEDROOM ONE MORNING A FEW DAYS LATER
Link puts on his new St Augustine Athletics shirt

Looks in the mirror Proud His big wife ANGELA then
steps up behind and wraps her arms around him

ANGELA
I want to take a picture of you

She goes and gets her camera He turns and faces her
folds his arms in front of him and smiles big CLICK

THAT WEEKEND JEFF AND NEALY GO FOR A HIKE IN THE DESERT
Luke is in a backpack looking at the birds

JEFF
This was a really good idea
Thanks for getting me out to do it

NEALY

It’s funny we live so close to all this
beauty and we never see it

(after a beat)
So I got an email about a big peace march
in the city coming up I was thinking
maybe we should walk in it together--
might be good for our souls--what do you
think

JEFF
Sure I’d love to
(after a beat)
Hey I almost forgot to tell you we’ve
been invited to go to dinner at Lincoln’s
house next Saturday night to celebrate
him getting the coaching job

NEALY
He got the job

JEFF
Yah isn’t that fantastic

NEALY
Yah

AT DINNER IN LINCOLN’S SMALL APARTMENT

Angela serves Jeff and Nealy Angela’s two boys COREY
and CALVIN 6 and 8 quietly wait for their share

NEALY
This is really nice of you thank you for
cooking

ANGELA

It’s the least we could do after all what
your husband’s done for us

LINCOLN
(raises water glass)
Here’s to Doc A saint

JEFF
Not a saint

LINCOLN
In my book you are Not only that
one heck of a basketball player

NEALY
Is he really a good basketball player or
are you just being nice to make him feel
good about himself

LINCOLN
I’m telling you Mrs Lang if Jeff were
69” understood how to play defense and
had a better jump shot he’d be killin’
‘em right now in the NBA

They all laugh Lincoln’s boys especially

Jeff looks at Lincoln’s boys and admires them they seem
like great happy kids

LINCOLN (CONT’D)
Anyone mind if I say a prayer

JEFF
Of course not

LINCOLN
Dear All Mighty Heavenly Father above
we thank you for the blessings you have
bestowed upon us

Jeff looks at Nealy gives him an approving smile
LINCOLN (CONTD)
Thank you for the love you have blessed
this family with and the peacefulness of
our household

Lincoln opens his eyes and his two boys say AMEN

LINCOLN (CONT’D)
Alright Ya’all can eat now

Nealy is disarmed and charmed by Lincoln They all eat
NEALY
Yum these potatoes are delicious

What’s the secret

ANGELA
Lots of butter

JEFF
Do you know I’ve known you all this time
and I never realized you had kids

LINCOLN
I never mentioned my boys

JEFF
I don’t think so How old are you guys

COREY
I’m eight and Calvin’s six

As the dinner continues in a warm silence cut away to

LILA WALKS THROUGH THE AISLES OF A LOCAL DRUGSTORE

Passing lots of feminine hygiene products on the way
she comes to a stop to regard EARLY PREGNANCY TEST KITS
She selects one and reads the back of the box

AFTER DINNER AS LINCOLN and JEFF DO THE DISHES

JEFF
So you haven’t told me how the team is
yet--are they any good

LINCOLN
Man these girls hustle like you wouldn’t
believe I’m telling you Doc

JEFF
That’s great

LINCOLN
But I’ve got to say the best thing about
all of it is the fact that my boys can be
proud of what their daddy does you know

Jeff looks at Lincoln admiring him

AS THEY EXIT LINCOLNS LOW RISE BUILDING

JEFF
That was nice wasn’t it

NEALY
Yeah it was

THEY GET INTO THEIR PRIUS AND DRIVE AWAY

JEFF
I’m really glad you came

She puts her hand on the back of his neck He basks in
her warm gesture for a moment Then

JEFF (CONTD)
Nealy you know that radio show
This American Life

NEALY
Of course

JEFF

Well I was listening to it a while back
and this woman they interviewed--her
story is she donated her kidney to a
friend and saved her friends life

(after a beat)
Anyway when I first heard the interview
the idea of donating my kidney to save
Lincoln popped into my head but it seemed
absurd at the time But then as I’ve
gotten to know him more I mean I’ve
realized he could really die and now I
see he’s got those two sweet boys who
depend on him and I thought maybe
I should

NEALY
You mean donate your kidney to him

He looks at her and nods Her expression is hard to read

NEALY (CONTD)
(after a beat)
Don’t you need your kidney Jeff

JEFF
People have two kidneys but they only
need one And when people get kidney
failure it effects both kidneys--so it’s
not like one is a backup for the other
Plus it’s a very safe operation for a
man in my condition and Id be up on my
feet in a week or less Here Ive been
doing some research

He grabs his briefcase from the backseat and gives her
some printouts on ORGAN DONATION

JEFF (CONTD)

He’s way down the waiting list--he could
die before his number’s ever called--and
he’s waiting for a kidney from a dead
person Medically speaking it’s much
better to get tissue from a living donor
Plus the longer he goes without getting
a new kidney the more damage will be
done to the rest of his body and
eventually he’1ll deteriorate and die

NEALY
Why doesn’t his wife donate to him

JEFF
According to Lincoln she had herself
tested and she wasn’t the best match in
terms of blood type which by itself
wouldn’t be a big problem with the new
kinds of anti-rejection meds we have on
the market today but unfortunately when
you’re as overweight as she is
the operation poses a fairly serious
health risk So they decided against it

NEALY
Why do you want to do this

JEFF
I just feel like doing something right
for a change Make myself a better person
I guess Do you think that’s stupid

She looks at him In actuality she feels the same way
about herself--though for vastly different reasons

NEALY
You’re a doctor when I look at you
I think you do the right thing every day
I’m the one selling overpriced
candlesticks to rich people

JEFF
Well then fine support me in this--it’s
a chance for us to both do some good

NEALY
(after a beat)
I have to think about it some more but
honestlyI think it might be a great idea

He looks at her incredibly surprised

NEALY (CONT’D)
I guess you were expecting me to put up a
big fight

JEFF
Yes actually

NEALY
No It’s a wonderful thought
To do something really selfless

JEFF
Well it’s not really selfless if my aim
is to make myself a better person
But no matter how I feel about myself
afterwards it will save Lincolns life
and I think that’s the point

NEALY
(after a beat)
What would you have to do to determine
if you’d be able to do this

JEFF
I’d have to show a staff psychologist at
Lincoln’s hospital I’m mentally stable
and have thought through the decision
Other than that get tested cross my
fingers and hope I’m a suitable donor

THE NEXT DAY AT HER STORE

Nealy sits by the register reading the research papers
Jeff gave her on kidney donation as a COUPLE in the store
discuss which coffee table they like (ad lib) Nealy
looks up from her computer and studies the continuing
coffee table discussion--inane compared to what she’s
contemplating

THEN ENTER A MIDDLE SCHOOL GYMNASIUM TO FIND

Lincoln drills the EIGHTH GRADE GIRLS TEAM One of the
GIRLS blows a jump shot and looks upset about it

LINCOLN
That’s good form Megan--don’t worry if it
doesn’t go in for now

Lincoln catches Jeffs eye blows his WHISTLE and then
instructs his players to keep doing the drill (ad lib)
Then he jogs over to meet Jeff by the gym entrance

LINCOLN (CONTD)
Doc what’re you doing here

JEFF
I come bearing some good news

LINCOLN
I like good news

JEFF
After having dinner at your house
my wife and I decided on something and
I gave your doctor a call Nice guy
(off his puzzled look)
I had myself tested to see if my kidney
might be compatible with you

Lincoln is stunned The girls keep doing the drill
LINCOLN
I’m sorry Doc are you saying what

I think you’re saying

Jeff nods The two men stand there looking into one
another’s eyes for a moment

JEFF
I’m a match Link

LINCOLN
I don’t know what to say I mean
Is this for real

JEFF
It’s for real

LINCOLN
Do things like this really happen

JEFF
I guess they do

LINCOLN
Am I looking at an angel or a man

IN A HOSPITAL SURGICAL PREP CENTER

Surrounded by drapes and the sounds of various TVs and
CHATTER a NURSE carefully shaves Jeffs side in the area
of his upcoming surgery Nealy sits by him watching
She reaches out and takes his hand They look at each
other warmly as the nurse finishes her business

IN SURGERY JEFFS EYES FLUTTER CLOSED AND THEN

His surgeon--DR BUDGE--removes a drape from Jeffs lower
back shaven and dotted where the incision will occur

The Surgeon then begins to cut him open and his skin
separates like the petals of a Magnolia to reveal an
incredibly graphic image of his innards

GLOVED HANDS PLACE A KIDNEY ON ICE IN A MEDICAL COOLER

LATER IN THE POST OP RECOVERY ROOM

Jeff awakens to find Nealy and Luke with flowers

JEFF
Hey baby

NEALY
Hey

JEFF

Hey little man

LUKE

Hey Dada

THE NEXT MORNING LILA WATERS PLANTS IN FRONT HER HOUSE
And a NEWSPAPER BOY rides his BMX up the driveway and

tosses a paper onto her porch She turns off her hose
and picks up the paper Sits on her stoop and opens it

LATER ROLL INTO A PRIVATE RECOVERY ROOM WHERE

Lincoln watches TV eating pudding turning to find

LINCOLN
Hey Doc

Jeff has been pushed into his room by a Nurse

JEFF
I can take it from here thanks

She nods and leaves The two men regard each other

JEFF (CONTD)
How do you feel

LINCOLN
My heart is warm I have so much love for
you right now Give me your hand

Jeff rolls closer Lincoln takes Jeffs hand and he
kisses it Lincoln does not let go anytime soon neither
does Jeff want him to

THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN TO REVEAL

Lila with a small potted basil plant

IN JEFFS PRIVATE RECOVERY ROOM MOMENTS LATER

Jeff lays reading Sports Illustrated when there’s a knock
on the door and it opens and he sees Lila with her basil

LILA
I brought you this basil plant These
hospitals are so toxic--so many germs

She sets the plant on the bedside table

JEFF
How did you know to find me here

LILA
You were in the paper didn’t you know

JEFF
No

She fishes the paper from her bag folded to the
headline SAVING A LIFE with a smiling color photo of
Lincoln prominently displayed It’s the photo Angela
took of him before his first day of work Arms folded in
front of him his forearm scar prominent

LILA
What a wonderful thing you did for him
saving his life getting him the job
everything I almost cried when I read
the part about how he hurt his arm
No doubt you’1ll be reaping the positive
Karma of this for a long time

JEFF
I hope so

LILA
Speaking of Karma there’s something
I need to tell you that I think may slam
the Karmic wheel of fate down on me hard

JEFF
(afraid to ask)
What

LILA
Well I know I shouldn’t’ve done it
but after I found out Matthew was
poisoned I was seeing red and I called
the city about your construction before I
ever even spoke with you about it

She gets another paper from the city from her bag

LILA (CONTD)
-and anyway they finally stopped by
yesterday and put this stop-work notice
on your door

Jeff regards this paper form the city Scrawled in pencil
in the notes area is STOP ALL WORK AND OBTAIN PERMITS

LILA (CONTD)
I’m really sorry Jeffery I should’ve
told you sooner

JEFF
It’s okay I probably would’ve done the
same thing if you’d killed my cat

She smiles at him appreciatively then her eyes shift
away and she starts to look nervous

LILA
There’s something else I have to tell
you

JEFF
Okay

She’s flustered can’t look in Jeffs eyes

LILA
Oh well here it goes
(searches for courage)
I’m pregnant With your baby

She looks him in the eye He looks as if he just found
out he’s going to die Pause

JEFF
(opens mouth but no words)

LILA
I know what you’re thinking But it’s
perfect if you think about it We’re
neighbors you can just come by and
visit like an uncle or something
No one has to know the whole truth

JEFF
(after a beat)
That wouldn’t work out Lila

LILA
(after a beat)
You want me to kill it don’t you

JEFF
(after a beat)
I wouldnt say kill it

Her eyes well up with tears and she slaps him in the face
as hard as she can As she strides out she turns and

SHRIEKS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS

And then she goes A long awful moment passes then a
NURSE runs into the room

NURSE
Dr Lang

JEFF
I’m okay

NURSE

What happened

JEFF
Private matter You can go Please

She nods and leaves Jeff then does whatever a man as
distressed as he is right now would do in these moments

OUTSIDE PHOENIX MEMORIAL HOSPITAL THE NEXT MORNING

A NURSE wheels Jeff to the curb where Nealy and the Prius
wait Nealy has a hand carved wooden cane with a bow on
it

NEALY
A present to help you walk

JEFF
Thank you

NEALY
Ready

He nods and then Nealy and the Nurse help get Jeff get up
onto his feet and into the passenger seat--which is
painful (ad lib any dialog)

IN THE PRIUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY

NEALY
I had a funny thought--now that you’re
missing one of your kidneys your other
organs have more elbow room now

JEFF
That is a funny thought

She sees something’s wrong but decides not to pursue it

NEALY
So Doctor Budge told me he was planning
to present you some kind of Humanitarian
Award at some upcoming Arizona Medical
Association banquet

JEFF
Yah he mentioned that to me too

NEALY
That’s pretty flattering isn’t it

JEFF
Do you really think it’s such a good idea
to make such a big deal about all this

NEALY
I think you did something pretty out of
the ordinary and if people want to hold
you up as an example that’s great

JEFF
Why’s it so great

NEALY
Because people seeing you honored for
what you’ve done could inspire more
people to do what you did and that would
make it all the more important

AS NEALY HELPS JEFF WALK UP THE STEPS OF THEIR HOUSE

They find a note from Lila pinned to the door
Jeff- We need to talk ASAP -Lila

NEALY
What’s that about

JEFF
About the construction again I guess

JEFF HOBBLES OUT OF HIS FRENCH DOORS TO SURVEY THE BACK
It’s ten times worse than ever Nealy steps beside him

NEALY
I thought about fixing it myself
but it just didn’t seem worth it

He nods and turns back inside walking with his cane

AT A LOCAL STARBUCKS

Walking fairly well with his cane Jeff finds Lila with a
coffee wearing dark sunglasses

LILA
Thanks for meeting me

JEFF
Sure

He eyes the coffee swirl on her foamy drink

LILA
Don’t worry it’s Decaf I wouldn’t
poison our baby with a double shot of
real Espresso They say that can cause
Autism but you’re the baby doctor

JEFF
So what did you want to talk about

LILA
I just wanted to talk you know
I don’t want to go through this alone

JEFF
Understandable

LILA
I want you to know I don’t expect child
support or something I just want our
baby to grow up knowing his father Nealy
never has to find out as long as we have
an understanding

He tamps down the hatred seething inside him enough to
fake a pleasant expression

PEACENIKS (VO)
What do we want PEACE

ON A STREET A CROWD HAS GATHERED TO CHEER ON
A parade of PEACENIKS march with anti-war signs chanting

PEACENIKS
When do we want it NOW

Jeff and Nealy march in very different head spaces Jeff
walks semi-normally now but still with his cane Some of
the FRIENDS from the anniversary party march with them

NEALY and JEFF and PEACENIKS
What do we want PEACE

THE ARCHER

LINCOLN and JEFF SIT IN THE RAFTERS OF THE MIDDLE SCHOOL
GYM ALONE QUIET A MOMENT AS SOME HEAVINESS SETS IN

LINCOLN
Dang Doc that’s a real tight spot this
woman’s put you in

JEFF
I’m sorry to lay it all on you--all my
friends are friends with my wife and
I feel like it would be really shitty of
me to make them keep secrets from her

LINCOLN
Makes sense to me

JEFF
There’s a psychiatrist at my hospital--I
could talk to him I guess--but he knows a
lot of people I know and I guess I don’t
really trust him with these facts

LINCOLN
Loose lips sink ships

JEFF
Exactly And just because it says
psychiatrist on his door doesn’t mean he
has any self control not to gossip

Jeff quiets as an 8th grade GIRL passes through from the
Locker Room to the exit all the way across the gym

LINCOLN
(blows his WHISTLE)
Good going today Molly

MOLLY smiles and waves and exits

LINCOLN (CONTD)
Doc my mother used to say “It’s
impossible to reason with an unreasonable
person” I think that’s what you’re
dealing with with this woman here

JEFF
I know this is sick but I keep wishing
she would meet an untimely end

LINCOLN
It’s understandable

JEFF
You wouldn’t believe how many ways I’ve
imagined her getting done in--some are
pretty funny actually

LINCOLN
Like what

JEFF
I’ll tell you my favorite There’re these
neighborhood kids two brothers who
practice archery in the empty lot across
the street from us I was imagining her
walking her little rat terrier one day
when one of their arrows flies off target
and just splits her head wide open

LINCOLN
Ouch

JEFF
Pretty sick ha

LINCOLN
Yeah but you know she’s threatening to
ruin your life

JEFF
Yah
(a long beat passes)
Well thanks again for listening I’ve been
wanting to confess to someone for so long
but you know we don’t go to church

LINCOLN
Shoot Doc Ill be your priest and your
soldier Whatever you need I’m yours

Jeff and Lincoln share a level look

LINCOLN (CONTD)
You know Leviticus teaches us that
adulteresses should be put to death
so if an arrow were to go off course
it would kind of be like God’s work
Of course according to Leviticus
the adulterer should be put to death too
so that’s no good for you Doc

JEFF
No it isn’t is it
(after a beat)
So howre you healing up

LINCOLN
I feel good You

JEFF
I don’t know I can walk normally now
but afterwards I still get sore I think
the stress of this thing with my neighbor
is making me heal slower or something

Lincoln looks upset to hear this A quiet moment passes

LATER IN THE BOY’S LOCKER ROOM LINCOLN TAKES A SHOWER

On his back is an old crude tattoo of two guns crossing

one another and the letters WEST SIDE CC intertangled--
an unsettling detail to make us realize we might not know
Lincoln like we think we do THE SCORE DARKENS as CAMERA

ZOOMS to this image

MEANWHILE JEFF IS IN HIS OWN SHOWER AT HOME WHEN

The curtain opens to reveal Nealy just home from work

NEALY
Why didn’t you tell me about Peter and
Rebecca

JEFF

Tell you what

NEALY
Merideth just called me and said they
filed for divorce She said you knew

JEFF
She did

NEALY
She told me Peter told you all about it

JEFF
Well I knew they were having problems--
I guess Pete told me that much last time
I saw him

By now Nealy’s at the sink taking off her make-up

NEALY
Well everyone knew they were having
problems I mean they hated each other
but still somehow it’s shocking

JEFF
Why’s it so shocking

NEALY
When two people hate each other as much
as they do but somehow manage to stay
married for as long as they have I guess
you just assume it’s going to last
forever

IN BED THAT NIGHT LINCOLN LOOKS PREOCCUPIED

ANGELA
You seem worried about something

LINCOLN
Do I look worried I’m sorry

ANGELA
Allow me to unworry you

She kisses him on the chest He rolls on top He grabs a
hold of her big tits and she smiles

AT HIS OFFICE JEFF EXITS AN EXAM ROOM TAKING NOTES WHEN
A NURSE PASSES
Dr Lang you have a new patient in room
six when you’re ready
JEFF PULLS THE NEW PATIENT’S CHART OUT OF THE INBOX OF 6
He enters opening the chart

AND THEN IN EXAM ROOM 6

Before his eyes leave the page his face goes still He
looks up at Lila in a paper gown on the exam table

LILA
I don’t have medical insurance so I
thought maybe you could help me out

JUMP TO A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Jeff puts on gloves and lubricates a metal wand attached
to an electronic box with a speaker on it

JEFF
This might be a little cold

He tells her as he inserts the wand into her pelvis

LILA
You wouldn’t put anything up there
to hurt the baby would you

JEFF
Id be thrown in jail if I was caught
doing something like that wouldn’t I

She accepts this and thenhe finds THE HEARTBEAT
broadcast from the blue box THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP

LILA
Does that mean

JEFF
It’s alive

SOMETIME LATER LINCOLN DRIVES HIS NOVA
Listening to some RandB on the radio smoking a Menthol

HIS NOVA GOES ACROSS THE STATE LINE INTO NEVADA

IN JEFF’S OFFICE LATER

Jeff is in terrible anxiety Eyes bloodshot he looks to
the ceiling as if looking for help from above

AT A GIGANTIC SPORTING AND HUNTING STORE LINCOLN PARKS
IN A DRESSING ROOM A BIT LATER

Lincoln tries on some oversized Army fatigues and looks
at himself in the mirror

IN THE AISLES OF THE STORE A BIT LATER

Army fatigues in his cart Lincoln rolls up to a few
standard archery bows in a glass case

AT A CONVENIENCE STORE

Link buys a bag of Jerky and a King Cobra Malt Liquor

AS SEEN THROUGH THE LEAVES OF SOME THICKET AT DUSK

Lila walks down her driveway with Steven At first she
walks in the opposite direction of her voyeur of

LINCOLN SQUATS BEHIND THE THICKET

He’s wearing a black cap a short sleeve camouflage shirt
and he clutches a cross-bow that looks like it was made
by the production designer of Star Trek for a Klingon
laser eye-scope power assist crank trigger release

LILA
Come on Steven this way

Lila turns her dog around and starts walking back toward
the empty lot with the archery target toward

Lincoln pulls his black hat down so it’s a ski-mask
readies his bow and looks through the scope With the
ski mask on Lincoln looks a bit like a raccoon

As Lila walks toward him a little red laser beam crawls
across the cement and starts dancing around her chest
her neck and her forehead Just then Steven catches the
scent of a treat and yanks at his leash

LILA (CONTD)
Steven

And now Steven is chewing up a piece of Beef Jerky

ILA (CONTD)
Oh Steven you shouldn’t eat that

Then Steven gets the scent of an entire bag of Beef Jerky
--the one Lincoln bought--spilled on the dirt in front of
the archery target Steven yanks Lila towards it

ILA (CONTD)
Oh yuk Steven no

Lila picks up the bag of Jerky to keep it away from her
dog who begs like crazy Just then she hears a CRACKLE OF
BRUSH and she’s startled to see

A large black man with a bow stands from the thicket and
takes a step towards her Black ski mask

Lila gasps terrified Red dot landing on her forehead

LILA (CONTD)
What do you want

Lincoln takes a step forward and readies himself

Lila takes a step backward Steven eats Jerky

LILA (CONTD)
Please don’t hurt me

Lincolns eyes look terribly ambivalent

LILA (CONTD)
Please I have a baby in my belly

And his arm is beginning to shake

LILA (CONTD)
Please you’re scaring me badly

She takes another step backward

LINCOLN
Stop

He takes another step forward jabs the bow forward
She covers her face tears streaming out

LILA
No no no oh God no

When she has the courage to look again she can see

Lincolns eyes visible between his ski mask are glazed
over with tears too

Their eyes are locked for a long moment and then

He can’t He lowers the bow She gasps in relief
He looks at the ground ashamed of himself

Then she notices

From where she stands she can see the scar on his arm

LILA (CONTD)
Youre the-
(decides to stay quiet)
Lincoln looks up Catches her eyes hanging on his arm

He looks at his own arm realizing she has noted an
identifying detail

She knows her eye-line has betrayed her and now terror
returns

LINCOLN
I’m the what

Lincoln raises the bow again

LILA
No

LINCOLN
I’m the what

She suddenly turns to run and

He squeezes the trigger release on the bow and
THWACK the arrow shoots right through her back and she
drops to the dirt twitching and bleeding And now

Steven still tethered to the leash which Lila continues
to clutch in her hand starts barking

Lincoln looks Lila over a moment satisfied because
there’s so much blood loss and so little movement then
he breaks into a run picking up a leather bag by the
bramble he was hidden in

Pulling off his ski mask putting his bow into the
leather bag he cuts across the desert field between
Jeffs cul du sac and the next street over

En route he falls over a rock picks himself back up
then continues “casually” to a rental car

IN THEIR BATHROOM THAT NIGHT

Jeff uses his electric toothbrush Studies Nealy in the
mirror as she takes off her makeup with a cotton pad

ACROSS THE STREET THE NEXT MORNING LILA IS CLEARLY DEAD

Steven lays by her side The Lang house frames the scene
Jeff and Nealy emerge from their house together Alma
follows with Luke in her arms so he can wave goodbye
After everyone says their good-byes Jeff and Nealy get
into their respective Priuses and drive away never
noticing the dead woman in the brush

As the Priuses drive past those two NERDY TEENAGE
ARCHERS emerge from their house with their backpacks and
get on their dirt-bikes to pedal back up the street
toward the deserted lot they like to cut through on their
way to schoolbut now they stop short

AND THEY TAKE PAUSE ON LILA AND HER TERRIER

They look at each other in abject horror A phone RINGS

IN HIS PRIUS DRIVING TO WORK JEFF PICKS UP HIS PHONE
JEFF
Hey Lincoln
SPLIT TO LINCOLN DRIVING IN HIS NOVA OPPOSITE DIRECTION
Lincoln’s dressed for work in his St Augustine’s shirt

LINCOLN
Hey Doc

JEFF
What’s going on

sINCOLN
You hear anything

JEFF
Anything about what

sINCOLN

Your neighbor

JEFF
No she’s been leaving me alone lately
Maybe it’1l stick

LINCOLN
Okay I got to go

Lincoln hangs up Jeff looks confused

IN JEFFS OFFICE HE EATS SUSHI WHEN HIS CELL RINGS AGAIN

JEFF
Hey Honey

SPLIT SCREEN TO NEALY STANDING OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE
As a Police INVESTIGATION goes on across the street

NEALY
I came home for lunch and something
awful happened

JEFF
Something awful

NEALY
Our neighbor Lila was shot with an arrow
and she’s dead

JEFF
I’m sorry--did you just say she was shot
with an arrow

NEALY
Across the street sometime last night

JEFF
You mean where those teenagers do target
practice

NEALY

It wasn’t them They were at a birthday
party when it happened

JEFF
Jesus do the Police have any idea who
did it

NEALY

I don’t know They asked me if she had
any enemies

JEFF
And you said

NEALY
I said no Why did she

JEFF
How would I know

NEALY
They asked you to come to the station
when you can to do an interview

JEFF
Why

NEALY
They said they were interviewing all the
neighbors
(after a beat)
Kind of puts a damper on tonight ha

MID CONVERSATION NEALY’S SIDE IS REPLACED BY LINCOLN

As he answers his cell in his Nova driving He now
wears an ill-fitting second hand suit

LINCOLN
Hey Doc

JEFFS SIDE OF THE SPLIT SCREEN JUMPS TO HIM IN HIS PRIUS
Jeff now wears a fancy suit on his cell

JEFF
I’m not sure what to say to you

LINCOLN
I guess you heard
(silence for a beat)
She can’t hurt you no more Doc
You’re home free mission accomplished
JEFF
You realize I didn’t actually want you
to shoot her with an arrow You realize
I was just venting

LINCOLN
You may have been venting but you wanted

JEFF
I sometimes have rape fantasies too
but I don’t go out and do it
(after a beat)
The woman was carrying my baby Lincoln
My own flesh and blood

LINCOLN
You told me you wished she would just get
an abortion

JEFF
I didn’t mean for you to perform it
(after a beat)
What if they do a DNA test on the fetus

LINCOLN
I’m guessing you don’t have any DNA
samples in the national crime lab’s
database

JEFF
What if the Police ask me for a sample

LINCOLN
Why would they

JEFF
What if she kept a diary Lincoln
Did you ever consider that

LINCOLN
No

JEFF
Yah well maybe I’1l get lucky and she
didn’t Jesus

LINCOLN
If you want me to turn myself in Doc
Iwill I’11 tell them just how it
happened and that you didn’t actually
mean for me to do it

it

JEFF
I don’t know Lincoln I can hardly form
a thought right now much less make a
decision like that

LINCOLN
I‘1l just go along with whatever you decide
(beat)
Are you still on your way to the thing

JEFF
Yah I’ll see you soon I guess

And with that Jeff hangs up Eyes red with worry

LINCOLNS SIDE OF THE SPLIT IS CANCELLED BY NEALY

She waits outside her store for Jeff to pick her up
She’s wearing a fancy dress She waves as

JEFFS SIDE OF THE SPLIT DRIVES UP BESIDE HER
And Nealy gets inside the car

NEW ANGLE ON THE WINDSHIELD A TWO SHOT AS
They pull forward in silence for a moment

Then SUDDEN APPLAUSE

IN A HOTEL BALLROOM

Jeff and Nealy sit at a table in the center of a dinner
organized in their honor Their friends Merideth and Ron
sit beside them Lincoln is there too in his ill-
fitting suit A STANDING OVATION now begins for Jeff
Jeff looks to be barely buttoning down a panic attack

DR BUDGE
(amplified)
Come on come on up

Dr Budge is on stage where a banner reads AMERICAN
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ARIZONA He waves Jeff up

Jeff resists standing for far too long which makes Nealy
nervous and then he finally gets up and walks to the
stage and Dr Budge gives him a gold placard

The APPLAUSE doesn’t end anytime soon Jeff looks like
he might collapse under the weight of his hypocrisy
Fights back the urge to cry

CONFESSION

IN HIS PRIUS DRIVING HOME

NEALY
Really weird day ha

JEFF
You can say that again

NEALY
(re the gold placard)
Well on the upside this will look really
great in your office It’1ll make your
patients feel like they’ve got a really
great doctor

JEFF
Yah really pull the wool over their eyes

NEALY
Why would you say that Jeff

He doesn’t say anything he’s sweating spontaneously his
panic attack unbuttoned now

NEALY (CONTD)
What’s going on Jeff--you’re shaking
THE PRIUS PULLS OVER ON A TWO LANE WOODED ROAD

It’s very dark save for the Prius’ head-lamps

INSIDE THE IDLING CAR

She stares at him as he stares at the road ahead
gripping the wheel too tightly unnecessarily

JEFF
I never told you this before because
I was too ashamed but I cheated my way
through medical school

NEALY
You did what

JEFF
Cheat sheets Very elaborate written on
little pieces of paper in every pocket
Tiny writing And I’ve cheated on every
medical board exam I ever had to take

She doesn’t know what to make of this or what to say

JEFF (CONTD)
When I was a kid I had this doctor who
misdiagnosed my Chickenpox as Dermatitis
I came down with a 106 degree fever and
I almost died Did I ever tell you that

NEALY
No

JEFF
When I was in the hospital recovering
my Mother and Grandmother were sitting
around and I overheard my Grandmother
say “Well I guess not all Doctors made
As” That always stuck with me Turns
out I became one of those doctors a Ct
doctor

NEALY
Why are you telling me this now Jeff

The tension mounts as they sit there in silence Then
something catches Jeffs eye

JEFF
(whispers )
Nealy look

In the head lamps in front of them a HUGE RACCOON
wanders into the road to feed on some debris

The car sits idly for a moment as they both regard the
animal before them Then

Jeff suddenly guns the Prius and Nealy SCREAMS in protest-
As the animal stands looking into the light--

NEALY
OH GOD JEFF WHAT ARE YOU-

THUD--

The Prius runs the raccoon over

And then Jeff backs up-- Nealy now mortified and silent--
--and The Prius runs over the animal again--THUD--
Nealy and Jeff then regard

The raccoon twitches in front of them in the head lamps
JEFF
(after a long beat)
I don’t want to lose our marriage
I believe in our marriage I believe that
we can have a good life together
but it has to start now No more lies
no more omissions

She’s petrified

JEFF (CONTD)
I guess I just have to hope maybe
Maybe there’s a chance that even the most
dismal problems can be overcome Somehow

NEALY
What are we talking about here Jeff

JEFF
The reason Peter Mazzoni and Rebecca are
getting divorced is because he found out
I had sex with her He called a meeting
with me and extorted a hundred thousand
dollars from me as my punishment

A long nightmarish beat passes

NEALY
Peter Mazzoni extorted you for a hundred
thousand dollars because you fucked
Rebecca

JEFF
Yes Only once I mean obviously
he only extorted me once What I mean is
I only had sex with Rebecca once I’m
sorry for not coming clean while it was
happening but I didn’t think it would be
very helpful to burden you with it

NEALY
Wow

JEFF

It gets worse

(off her look)
A lot worse

(beat)
The thing is I was joking around with
Lincoln about how I wished our crazy
neighbor Lila would die and

He doesn’t know how to continue the story

NEALY
You mean

JEFF
I didn’t think he was taking me literally
Nealy I swear but

NEALY
You’re telling me Lincoln killed Lila
with a bow and arrow

Jeff nods

NEALY (CONTD)
Why Why would he do that

JEFF
Well this is the kicker
(long pause)
She was pregnant With my child

NEALY
You fucked Lila too

JEFF
Yes to stop her from telling you about
my thing with Rebecca She was so
volitile--I was afraid and then

Nealy leans back shocked trying hard to process this

NEALY
How in the world did Lila know about you
having sex with Rebecca

JEFF

Because I accidentally poisoned her cat
And so she followed me to work one day to
confront me about it and there was Peter
shoving me in the hallway And then she
came on to me and when I tried to resist
she went absolutely ballistic--practicaly
apoplectic--and threatened to tell you
what I’d done She’s obviously mentally
ill or bipolar or who knowsanyway
I know it’s a terrible excuse

(after a moment)
The chances she would get pregnant from
that one time it’s so fucking slim but
it really happened didn’t it and now

His eyes search

NEALY
What about Honey the erotic massage
therapist

JEFF
What about her

NEALY
Now that you’re baring all did you fuck
her too

JEFF

Believe it or not that actually happened
just the way I told you originally

A few moments pass and then Nealy laughs

NEALY
I don’t know why I’m laughing I’m sorry

She gets out of the Prius
Jeff watches from inside as She paces the shoulder

Then suddenly runs to the car and pounds on the hood
three times screaming

NEALY (CONT’D)
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST

Then she turns away and grows very still in the lights
HE GETS OUT OF THE CAR AND WALKS AROUND TO SEE HER FACE

She looks at him She’s ghost white She returns to the
car Gets back in

LIT BY THE GLOW OF THE DASH

She looks up to see

Jeff staring back at her in the bright white light
She rolls down the window looks at the empty road
He then gets back in the car in the driver’s seat

They sit in silence a moment--he in the suspense of what
her final reaction to all this is going to be

NEALY (CONTD)
As long as we’re coming clean before
that big fight we had when I hit you
(MORE)

NEALY (CONTD)
Id been having an affair for over a
year I never loved him it’s just
in a nutshell I think after Luke was
born I missed feeling attractive so badly
and he gave that back to me

JEFF
Do I know the guy

NEALY
No I met him when he came into the store
looking for a new couch

JEFF
How did it start

NEALY
He didn’t see anything he liked so he
asked me to help him design an original
We picked out some blue corduroy fabric
Then he had me measure the length from
his waist to his knee so we could get the
exact right depth for the seat cushions
and when I put the tape on him we had a
little moment and it went on from there

After a long beat Jeff gets out of the car again
HE STEPS INTO THE HEAD LAMPS AND SQUATS BY THE ANIMAL
It’s hurt badly and its breaths are labored One of its
legs has been completely flattened and is bleeding Its
fur on its back has been partially torn away

Nealy walks into the light to see the carnage up-close

too Jeff then picks up a stick and pokes at the animal
and suddenly

The raccoon pushes itself up on three legs and gets into
a broken defensive pose

Jeff and Nealy take a step back as

The Raccoon looks right into Jeff’s eyes Then right
into Nealy’s Everyone shares a look of pure agony

The Raccoon then drags its body off the road into the
dark woods and vanishes

JEFF
Nealy I know in the past I’ve resisted
going into therapy with you but now
(he starts laughing)
--if you’1l still have me

And now she cracks up too They both start laughing
hysterically It’s belly splitting madness They laugh
until the laughter ends of its own volition

They regard each other for a long moment then

NEALY

You know what I didn’t really get to it
before when I said I had my affair to
feel attractive again There’s more too
it I think

(beat)
When we first got to know each other we
used to really talk about things you
know we used to be idealistic we used
to look forward to all the things we’d do
together didn’t we

JEFF
Sure yes

NEALY
I feel like now now we both have totally
separate lives aside from when we lay in
bed together with Luke I feel connected
with you then But I don’t know I just
feel really alone in the world lately
and I think to be totally honest that’s
the real reason I had an affair with
Chris

JEFF
Okay I get it

NEALY
(after a beat)
Is there anything more you want to say to
me

JEFF
What do you want to know

NEALY
I want to know what you think of our
marriage I want to know why you think we
should stay married--I mean other than
for Luke’s sake I want to know if you
love me

JEFF
Okay Just a second
(gathers his thoughts)
The short answer is yes I think we
should stay married
(MORE)

JEFF (CONTD)
But why we should that’s I guess a long
answer and
And I guess I agree with you we’ve been
disconnected for a long time living in
separate universes for a long time
Honestly I think about it a lot--all the
time really And if you’re asking me to
be brutally honest

NEALY
I am

JEFF
Sometimes I’ve thought we made a mistake
getting married--we got married so young
When we fight sometimes I think it’s
obvious Are you sure you want to do
this

She nods

JEFF (CONTD)
The truth is sometimes I don’t think
I love you anymore Nealy I’m not even
sure that love exists and I think it’s
just some kind of neurotic projection of
my ego that I want but can never really
have Like we’re just stuck in some kind
of weird gum being chewed up by
circumstance and we don’t know how to get
out But then that moment of hell and
uncertainty always seems to pass And
every now and again it gets replaced by
something so much better than that--
something light and nice and familiar--
like when we laugh together--something
that reminds me of the way I used to feel
when I was a kid before the whole
shitstorm happened between my parents
that blew them apart and made me a God
damn cynic

AS THEY DRIVE HOME TOGETHER TOGETHER WE CONT’ TO HEAR

JEFF (VO)
But when I feel that way I mean when
I feel light and happy with you it
always seems to outweigh the other stuff
It dwarfs it--as if the other stuff isn’t
even really real Like it’s resentment
and anger that’s the illusion not love
And even if that feeling lasts for only
(MORE)

JEFF (VO) (CONTD)
a couple moments somehow it feels like
that’s the real way I feel all the time--
as if I had just forgotten or something
And I weigh the pluses and minuses of all
that you know like a scientist a C
scientist maybe but the solution to the
equation I always seem to come to is that
I do love you and I do know what love
is and I never want to lose you no
matter how fucked or ambivalent I feel

AS JEFF AND NEALY RETURN HOME AND WALK INSIDE TOGETHER

JEFF (V0)
And that’s the solution that I always
remind myself of in the hard times when
I get silent and don’t want to talk after
a big fight--I mean after I cool down--
I replay all the pluses and minuses in my
head and I always come to the same
conclusion we should stay married as
complicated as it is

IN BED THAT NIGHT THEY LAY TOGETHER FACING EACH OTHER
JEFF
(after a long beat)

What will we do about Lincoln

NEALY
You mean should we turn him in

He nods She goes inward

JEFF
We have to don’t we

NEALY
He’s not going to come murder us to cover
his tracks is he

JEFF
I don’t think so Nealy

NEALY
Then what threat is he to us

JEFF
None

NEALY
And is he a threat to anyone else--his
family his friends the girls he
coaches

JEFF
I wouldn’t have thought so two days ago
But I wouldn’t have thought he would kill
a pregnant woman with a bow and arrow
either Anyway why are you asking this

NEALY
Because if he’s not a threat to anyone
why should he go to prison

JEFF
Well I think to be really simple about
it because what he did is
unconscionable

NEALY
This has nothing to do with anyone’s
conscience--this is the real world

She pauses thinks He waits for her to complete her
thought

NEALY (CONTD)
If we turn him in his two boys grow up
without a father His wife gets to be
a single mother On top of that the
press would run like crazy with the story
and at best Luke would grow up with a
cloud of murder and weirdness hovering
over his head All so a man trying to
pay you back for saving his life can be
punished for a lonely woman’s death who
tricked you into getting her pregnant

They both contemplate the scenario

JEFF
Nealy

She faces him He touches her tenderly

JEFF (CONTD)
I don’t want that for us but

They look into each other’s eyes Bonded intimately by
this bizarre problem

She scoots closer Then he scoots closer to her They
kiss on the mouth for the first time in years

Even when they were fucking in the mirror it was not
close to this intimate They look into one anothers
eyes

JEFF (CONTD)
I want to do the right thing Nealy

NEALY
For who

AT A LOCAL POLICE STATION THE NEXT DAY

A DETECTIVE sits at his desk across from Jeff as the rest
of the station bustles around

DETECTIVE
Did you ever see her entertaining any
men dating whatnot

JEFF
No she kept to herself I don’t think
she even had a job

DETECTIVE
Her elderly parents supported her

JEFF
I see I never saw them visit

DETECTIVE
They live in a retirement home
She visited them sometimes

JEFF

Did she stand to inherit their money
DETECTIVE

Yes why
JEFF

Maybe she had a jealous brother or sister

DETECTIVE
No she was an only child So you never
saw any men coming and going from her
house

JEFF
DETECTIVE

Did she ever mention any past boyfriends
to you or your wife

JEFF
No not that I remember But I guess
you’re asking that because she was
pregnant

The Detective looks at him curiously

DETECTIVE
Yah how did you know

JEFF
I know because she came to me to be her
obstetrician Maybe you knew that already
from an appointment book she kept or
something

DETECTIVE
No it’s news to me

JEFF
Right well anyway I asked her who the
father was when she first came in but she
didn’t want to say for some reason
It was kind of strange to tell the truth
I never had a patient do that before

The Detective appears to take Jeff at face value Writes
some notes on his pad

AT THE YMCA IN THE GYMNASIUM

A five on five basketball game is going on with some
intensity framing Jeff sitting on the bench with some
OTHER MEN waiting to play SLOWLY PUSH to Jeff and then
Lincoln shows up and sits next to him

LINCOLN
I think I’m getting an ulcer Doc

JEFF
I can prescribe you something for that

Lincoln wears a tank top today and as he leans forward
Jeff notices his gang tattoo for the first time ever

Regarding the worried look on Link’s face Jeff takes
stock of his moral inventory for a moment Then

JEFF (CONTD)
The Police still haven’t contacted you

LINCOLN
No

THE FLOWERING GARDEN

AS A PHONE RINGS SLOWLY PUSH TO THE LANG HOUSE

The 2nd story construction remains unfinished In the
living room window we see Jeff pick up a cordless phone

JEFF
Hello

INTERCUT JOSE IN HIS TRUCK EATING LUNCH AS NEEDED

JOSE
Jefe it’s Jose did you file the new
plans yet

JEFF

Yes so all we can do is cross our
fingers and hope the city approves them

JOSE

I’m sure it’s going to work out
JEFF

Hope so
JOSE

Listen on not exactly the same note but
similar I think I have a better idea
than the flagstone for the backyard

JEFF
I’m listening

JOSE
Well it’s so obvious but in the front
of your house where you have no sod but
you have a lot of flowers and shrubs
the raccoons never mess around out there
do they

By now this front garden is prominent in frame beneath
the window And Jeff stands looking out at it

JEFF
No they leave it alone Are you going to
tell me we should do something out back
like we have in front

LATER LATINOS REMOVE THE SOD IN THE BACK PIECE BY PIECE

JOSE (VO)
I’m thinking the reason the garden alone
in front is because without the sod
moisture isn’t trapped in the topsoil
So no worms or grubs or racoons

IN BED AT NIGHT JEFF AND NEALY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT

(a jump back in time to conclude previous bedroom scene)

JEFF
Nealy
NEALY
Yah
JEFF
What do you think’s going to happen to
us

There is a pause in the conversation but

AFTER THE SOD HAS BEEN STRIPPED IN THE BACKYARD

We hear Nealy’s answer as LATINOS replant the backyard
with scores of colorful shrubs flowering trees etc

NEALY (VO)
I think we’re going to stay up all night
thinking about how monstrous it is to
agree to make the decision we’re making
I think we’re going to talk about it
night after night until one day we decide
not to and for a long time we’1l
probably worry that somehow you’1ll get
implicated and the truth will be exposed

A bit later Jose places a new beautiful stone fountain
down It’s a glorious sunny day Lots of work being done

NEALY (VO) (CONT’D)
That anxiety will stay with us for a long
time Maybe we won’t make it Maybe
we‘ll implode with guilt I don’t know
Maybe that’s what should happen to us--or
something worse Or maybe we’1l make it
through

(MORE)

NEALY (VO) (CONTD)
Obviously not exactly how we pictured it
when we went on our first date but who
says we need to be punished for this--
what did either of us really do that was
so wrong beyond betraying each other
which is obviously awful but

JUMP CUT TO THE NEARLY FINISHED PRODUCT

Stone pathways have now been laid surrounded by a jungle
of plant-life No sod for the raccoons to flip over The
fountain now springs water A few plants are still in
their black plastic pots a few holes have yet to be
filled a few Latinos are still hard at work

NEALY (VO)
You didn’t ask Lincoln to do what he did
He just misunderstood you and

JUMP TO A SHOT OF THE BACKYARD BUT AT NIGHT

A bunch of new low voltage lights artfully illuminate all
the new plants

NEALY (VO)
Nothing like this will ever happen again
That’s the main thing

As Nealy completes her thought we PUSH to the tree where
the wind-chimes once were No raccoon comes tonight

SOMETIME LATER OUTSIDE LILA’S HOUSE

A REALTOR plants a FOR SALE sign in the front yard and
the construction on the Lang house is complete Inside
the living room window we see what appears to be a very
pregnant Nealy cross by

IN THE NOW WILD OVERGROWN FLOWERING GARDEN

Luke Jeff and Nealy belly protruding with their second
child eat lunch on a flagstone patio in the middle of
all the plant life Bees and hummingbirds buzz around
them The garden is so colorful and bright it’s surreal
Beside Jeff is a new vegetable garden As we PUSH TO the
family a gopher pops up from the vegetable garden and
looks at the tomatoes above Sensing something Jeff
turns toward the gopher and it ducks out of sight Jeff
then continues to eat his sandwich

THE END
