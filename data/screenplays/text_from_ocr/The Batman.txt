The quiet hum of CITY TRAFFIC and DISTANT SIRENS

Gradually we make out something unnerving right beside

us SOMEONE BREATHING A MASSIVE RED TITLE FADES UP
“T HE BoA T M A N”

HOLD then SMASH OUT OF THE BLACKNESS TO REVEAL --

ANOUT OF FOCUS BINOCULAR POV - DUSK

We FOCUS SEARCHING THE FACADE OF AN OPULENT TOWNHOUSE
The BREATHING SUDDENLY QUIETS as a SHAPE APPEARS IN A

WINDOW -- a LITTLE RED NINJA gazes out clutching a small
sword The ninja spins brandishing the sword as TWO
SHAPES enter behind him -- a WOMAN late 30s dressed as

a WITCH -- and a MAN late 50s in a WELL-CUT SUIT

The little ninja rushes in “stabbing” the Man who
collapses melodramatically The Woman smiles -- speaks to
the ninja and he grabs a PUMPKIN CANDY BUCKET as they
start to exit The Man sits up yells after them the
ninja runs back for a hug Finally the ninja and Woman
exit LEAVING THE MAN ALONE He grows SOBER As the Man
pulls himself up the BREATHING BESIDE US RESUMES

INT OPULENT TOWNHOUSE - DIMLY-LIGHTED STUDY - NIGHT

In the light of the flickering TV we see now the Man is
handsome distinguished He stands sipping scotch
watching THE NEWS a CHYRON reads “GOTHAM MAYORAL RACE”

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
Just-released polls have incumbent
mayor Don Mitchell Jr and
twenty-eight year old grassroots
challenger Bella Real in a dead
heat Things certainly got hot
last night in their final debate
before next Tuesday’s election

As the Man anxiously watches the DEBATE CLIP we realize
heis MAYOR MITCHELL his female challenger BELLA REAL
young intelligent a force of nature shares the stage --

MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)
Now my young opponent here wants
to gut the Gotham Renewal Program
established by the great Thomas
Wayne cutting the funds for vital
projects like our sea wall and
the safety net for those in need--

( )
020920 (White February Shooting Script) 2

BELLA REAL (ON TV)
-- the Renewal Program is broken
The city’s been “renewing” for
twenty years look where it’s

gotten us Crime has skyrocketed

MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV) BELLA REAL (ON TV)
Now wait a minute -- hold Murder and drug use are at
on -- historic highs We have a

masked vigilante running
the streets

MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)
-- under my administration the
Gotham PD dealt major blows
against organized crime and drug
trafficking The Salvatore Maroni

case was the biggest druq bust in
city history --

BELLA REAL (ON TV) MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)
-- but drops and other I’m not saying there isn’t
drugs are still rampant work to do — but listen --
It’s gotten worse I have a beautiful wife and

young son ok I will not
rest until this city is
safe for them -- and all
our citizens

Mitchell turns startled as a PHONE RINGS As he EXITS
FRAME to answer we STAY on a DARK HALL BEHIND THE STUDY
-- on the wall by the doorway we see a framed headline
“MARONI DRUG BUST MAYOR’S STING OPERATION HISTORIC”

As the TV brightens we SEE for the first time SOMEONE
Is IN THE HALL Barely visible the Figure wears a DARK

OLIVE GREEN HOOD -- a homemade executioner’s mask with

PRESCRIPTION AVIATOR GLASSES bizarrely outside the hood

MAYOR MITCHELL (0S)
Hey Yeah I’m watching GCl

As Mitchell PACES IN AND OUT OF FRAME the Figure’s
hooded head ominously tracks him

MAYOR MITCHELL (0S)
Why is she still tied -- I thought
we were getting a bump in the new
Post poll Ok you know what I
can’t I can’t watch this anymore
-- call me in the morning --

We HEAR the phone hang up and Mitchell RE-ENTERS FRAME
agitated as he SHUTS OFF THE TV the HALL BEHIND HIM
SUDDENLY GOES DARK the FIGURE NO LONGER IN SIGHT

020920 (White February Shooting Script) Jo

Mitchell stands there drink in hand starts to sip as --
THE FIGURE LURCHES OUT THE DARK -- FRANTICALLY CLUBBING

HIM OVER AND OVER -- suddenly the WEAPON SLIPS LOOSE --
it SKITTERS right at us and STOPS A GLEAMING METAL TOOL

Whatever it is it’s WET with blood The Figure turns
PANTING rises off the motionless victim trudges over to

us A GLOVED HAND retrieves the strange weapon
The Figure walks back regarding the victim for a long
creepy moment then stretches its arms as far as they

will go LOUDLY UNSPOOLING a LONG PIECE OF SILVER DUCT
TAPE And with a LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER we SLAM INTO --

BLACKNESS AGAIN

We HEAR PATTERING RAIN as a HYPNOTIC VOICE OVER begins

what he assumes is just another Halloween costume --

THE LEADER
The hell are you supposed to be

Batman stands there for a long scary beat eyes veiled

THE BATMAN

The unsettling effect of this response has barely an
instant to register before BATMAN stalks for THE LEADER --

Holy shit -- it’s him --

THE LEADER raises his hands ready to fight -- but totally
unprepared for this fight -- because -- BATMANS

below it “ACTING MAYOR TOMLIN TO RUN IN HIS PLACE”

GCl NEWSCASTER
-this certainly isn’t the first
time Gotham has been rocked by the
murder of a political figure In
fact in an eerie coincidence it
was twenty years ago this month
that celebrated billionaire
philanthropist Dr Thomas Wayne
and his wife Martha were slain
during Wayne’s own mayoral
campaign in a shocking crime that
remains unsolved to this day --

Bruce’s eyes go to the TV when from the FREIGHT ELEVATOR
steps ALFRED 50s muscular waistcoat and shirtsleeves --
he walks on an elegant CANE SCAR on his face eyes on

to Bruce -- an unspoken tension Bruce avoids his gaze --

Youre becoming quite a celebrity

BRUCE

It’s getting serious Bruce If
this continues it won’t be long
before you’ve nothing left --

BRUCE
I don’t care about that Any of
that

ALFRED

--you don’t care about your
family’s legacy

BRUCE
What I’m doing is my family’s
legacy -- and if I can’t change

things here if I can’t have an
effect then I don’t care what

aTHICK CHAIN coiled crudely through the handles a

PADLOCK sealing us off from whatever is beyond -- Bruce
Moves past down stairs wet hair pulling on a t-shirt --

muscular but underweight like a rock star -- a street
fighter’s scars and bruises -- MOVE with him through the
apartment’s hotel-like scale -- and neglect that has left
dirt and disrepair over former grandeur -- he ENTERS --

THE DINING ROOM

-- to find Alfred at the table immersed in what looks
like a crossword -- without looking up Alfred points --

ALFRED
Some fresh berries there

Bruce squints unaccustomed to morning grabbing berries
he pulls out sunglasses -- when he sees Alfred’s working
on the CIPHER Alfred‘s interest breaks the ice --

BRUCE
-what’re you doing

ALFRED
Just reminiscing about my days in
the Circus This is actually
quite elusive

BRUCE
Where’d you get the Os

ALFRED
“He lies still” is only a partial
key It only gives us H E L I
and S -- so I’m looking for any
double symbols to start trying
letters see where it leads

BRUCE
Interesting

ELDERLY MAID

ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES
I’m afraid we’re at a critical
point here --

shifts distractedly to Alfred’s newspaper on the table --

ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES
At the very least we’ll need your
signature to cover these losses

Bruce reaches for the newspaper opens it -- the execs
glance at each other thrown Alfred smiles apologetic --

Bruce stares at the SEA OF LETTERS wheels turning --

And as Bruce signs -- we PRELAP

ALFRED
What do you mean

102519 (October Shooting Draft) 18

BRUCE
What if it’s the whole key Ignore
the symbols we don’t have letters
for use only the letters from “he
lies still” and leave the rest -—-

ALFRED

-- blank yes -- I understand --

(deleting letters)
-- but that will leave most of the
cipher unsolved I don’t see how
that -- oh

(suddenly impressed)
Well

They gaze at THE LAPTOP most of the cipher is now blank

but the remaining letters line up like connect-the-dots
to form A SINGLE HUGE WORD across the page “D RI VE”

No This is very personal He
feels these people have all
wronged him Probably goes way
back Unhealed wounds stolen

Why’s he writing to me

UNSEEN PRISONER’S VOICE

got a grudge against you too

Maybe youre the main course Any

own hypothesis

THE RAT’S MAZE that was on COMMISSIONER SAVAGE’S head --

ALFRED
I’m afraid his Spanish is less

certain it translates to “You are

BRUCE
“Rata alada” rat with wings

ALFRED
It’s slang for pigeon -- make any
sense to you

BRUCE ALFRED
Yeah astool pigeon -- -- where are your
cufflinks

Annoyed Bruce relents letting Alfred slip one on -- he
sees a MONOGRAMMED W on the link -- gives Alfred a look --
BRUCE

Your father gave them to me

That catches Bruce off guard -- he looks at him thrown --

AN EERIE VOICE BEHIND(OS )
What good’s a safety net doesn’t
catch anybody

Bruce turns -- to see A BITTER NOBODY in a hooded work
jacket angry eyes on the VIPS as they file past --

BITTER NOBODY

needed it -- I can tell you that
Guy was just another rich
scumsucker He got what he

BELLA REAL
Will you wait for me I wanna go
pay my respects -- my God what a

THE DINING ROOM FLOOR IS NOW A MASSIVE EVIDENCE BOARD --

them -- he closes one -- fumbling for another -- when a
huge stack BEGINS TO TOPPLE -- he LURCHES to save it --
KNOCKING OVER MORE -- thousands of pages spilling --
Bruce watches helpless as they scatter everywhere --

He stands there watching it all settle FINALLY HE
SNAPS -- HURLING OVER the other stacks -- PAPER EXPLODING
EVERYWHERE -- BRUCE’S PENT-UP FURY UNLEASHED -- SMASHING

UP THE ROOM DESTROYING EVERYTHING -- FURNITURE -- ART --
HIS RAGE IS TERRIFYING -- even as he begins to EXHAUST
HIMSELF -- running out of things to smash -- but not
sated searching for more -- when he sees SOMETHING

understand why he looked at me the

way he did Then one night my
mother told me who he was

SELINA
When I was seven my mother was

murdered Someone strangled her

some creep from the club Anyway

me away he didn’t say a thing
Couldn’t even look at me

(looks up at him)

He owes me that money

BATMAN

BRUCE
My father hated everything you

FALCONE
(smiles)

want anything to do with me
(darkens bitter)
»--til you need me Right

A beat as they look at each other

FALCONE
Your father was in trouble ok
This reporter had some dirt some
very personal stuff about your
mother her family history you
know everybody’s got their dirty
laundry that’s how it is But he
didn’t want none of that coming
out not right before the
election Your father trieda pay
this guy off but he wasn’t goin’
for it So he came to me I never
seen him like that He said I
want you to put the fear of God in
this guy

Bruce stares unnerved

FALCONE
And when fear isn’t enough you
take it to the next level Your
father wanted me to handle it
(a shark’s eyes)
So I did I handled it

Bruce is truly unmoored Falcone enjoying his pain

was a lowlife he was on Maroni’s
payroll -- he got what was comin’

BRUCE
-Maroni

FALCONE

Oh yeah Maroni could never stand
your father and I had history And
after what happened with this
reporter I think he was worried

forever He woulda done anything
to keep him from becoming mayor

(a pointed beat)
Ya understand

Bruce shakes his head reeling resisting the notion

FALCONE
--Sure ya do

BRUCE
Are you saying Salvatore

staring at the CHAINED and PADLOCKED SET OF DOORS

INT BRUCE’S PARENTS’ DARKENED BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 125

Untouched in twenty years a frozen moment covered in
dust Bruce enters taking in the unbearable stillness
In the early light he sees a man’s suit jacket draped on
a chair a pair of glasses rest on an old newspaper
He turns seeing a STAINED TEACUP askew in its saucer on
a womans dressing table behind it on the mirror are
yellowed CHILDREN’S CRAYON DRAWINGS his One’s a stick-

A quiet HEART MONITOR BEEPING begins as Bruce stares

rumpled Bruces smiles sadly finally speaking pained

BRUCE
-you lied to me My whole life

I spoke to Carmine Falcone

Pain and shock fill Alfred’s eyes he blinks away then
back Finally he struggles for voice hoarse

ALFRED
--whatd he say

BRUCE
-he told me what he did
for my father and about
Salvatore Maroni

Alfred’s eyes burn trying to understand
ALFRED
-he told you Salvatore
Maroni

BRUCE

BRUCE (CONTD)
I spent all these years fighting

for him believing he was a good

man -—-
ALFRED

-- he was a good man --

Bruce shakes his head -- but Alfred grows more fierce -—-

ALFRED

-- listen to me your father

was a good man -- he made a

mistake --
BRUCE

A mistake He had a man killed --
why -- to protect the family image

-- his political aspirations --

ALFRED
-- it wasn’t to protect the family
image -- and he DIDN’T have anyone

killed
The forcefulness of that makes Bruce stop — he looks at
Alfred who continues simply emotional

ALFRED
He was protecting your mother He
didn’t care about his image the
campaign any of that He cared
about her And you These
secrets about your mother’s
family they haunted her she‘d
battled them every single day We
all have our scars Bruce And
your father knew if everything
came out it’d be too much for
her It would destroy her He
just he loved her so much And
in a moment of weakness he turned
to Falcone Buthe never thought
Falcone would kill that man Your
father should have known that
Falcone would do anything to
finally have something on him he
could use to own him That’s
who Falcone is And that was your
father’s mistake
(then)
But when Falcone told him what
he’d done your father was
distraught -- he told Falcone he
was going to the police that’d
he’d confess everything
(MORE )

102519 (October Shooting Draft) 90

ALFRED (CONTD)
And that night your father and
your mother were killed

Bruce is stunned

BRUCE
it was Falcone

Alfred looks at him sadly so wanting to give Bruce the
answer he needs the answer he’s wanted his whole life

ALFRED
I wish I knew for sure
Yes maybe Or maybe it was
some random thug on the street who
needed money who got scared and
pulled the trigger too fast If
you don’t think I’ve spent every

day searching for that answer
(truly distraught)
It was my job to protect them --
do you understand I know you
always blamed yourself You were
only a boy Bruce I could see the
fear in your eyes But I didn’t
know how to help I could teach
you to fight -- but I wasn’t
prepared to take care of you You
needed a father But all you
had was me I’m sorry

Alfred averts his eyes red with heartbreak and regret
Bruce stares at him deeply affected

BRUCE
-no Alfred don’t be sorry
(then quiet struck)
God I never thought I’d feel
fear like that again I thought
I‘d mastered all that I mean I’m
not afraid to die

His unflinching gaze meets Alfred’s who nods solem
then Bruce’s eyes shift away again processing

BRUCE
But I realize now there’s
something I never got past The
fear of ever going through any
of that again
(looking at Alfred)
of losing someone I care about

Alfred looks back moved -- he smiles tears in his eyes

020920 (White February Shooting Script) 91 126

ALFRED
Well I’m afraid you won’t be
rid of me just yet

Bruce smiles sadly back then gazes off

BRUCE
I went into their room last night

Alfred is quietly struck

BRUCE
It all seemed so much smaller

Alfred watches Bruce a fleeting glimpse of the man as a
boy He reaches out a hand Bruce stares surprised
then lifts his own clasping Alfred’s tightly Then
Bruce darkens noticing something outside the window

stare -- Gordon approaches Batman hands him the ledger --

finally I UNDERSTOOD My whole
life has been PREPARING me for
this The moment when I would
learn the TRUTH when I could
finally strike back and EXPOSE
THEIR LIES”

grabs his attention he moves for it as Gordon goes on --

“Tf you want people to understand
REALLY understand you cant just
give them the answers You have to
CONFRONT them TORTURE THEM with

like they tortured ME I KNOW NOW

Riddler’s scrawl becoming illegible until it’s nothing
but ANGRY SCARS OF INK -- Gordon is shaken by the display
of insanity -- until the intense SCREECHING becomes TOO
MUCH -- he glances up seeing Batman by the cages --

GORDON
Jesus -- I don’t think that rat
likes you man -—-

This one’s not a rat

Gordon and the Surly Cop step closer to see inside the
cage is A RABID BAT It SNARLS BEARING ITS TEETH WINGS
BEATING -- beneath it is an ENVELOPE “TO THE BATMAN” --

attached to a strange BLOODY METAL TOOL --

BATMAN
-- it’s a murder weapon He killed
Mitchell with it

Batman opens the envelope -- another GREETING CARD says
“JUST FOR YOU” inside is SCRAWLED “MY CONFESSION”

confessing to He already told us
he killed Mitchell

Batman stares at the card with growing dread --

wall above to AN ENORMOUS COLLAGE -- a sea of DEFACED
PHOTOS -- scrawled over it “THE TRUTH ABOUT GOTHAM”

Batman steps forward gazing at IMAGES of city officials
police officers Riddler’s victims -- but most prominent
isan image of YOUNG BRUCE WAYNE beside his father at the
Orphanage ceremony -- their EYES ETCHED ANGRILY OUT

head -- looking at SOMETHING across the room --

RIDDLER’S LAPTOP SCREEN - SECONDS LATER
Batman enters the words “A REAL CHANGE” -- unlocking the
VIDEO Riddler in his hooded uniform -- his warm tone

weirdly incongruous with the ominous VOICE CHANGER

A MOVING SHOT - FOLLOWING A DARK FIGURE

Walking THE RAFTERS ABOVE GOTHAM SQUARE GARDEN pulling
on a Riddler-style execution hood rifle in hand

RIDDLER (VO)
---you’ll be there waiting

The Hooded Figure stares ominously below where panicked
commotion suggests news of the flooding is spreading --

when the Figure looks up SPOTTING

ANOTHER ARMED HOODED FIGURE staring back at him -- they
regard each other oddly then nod grimly -- when they

turn to see a THIRD Riddler Figure arriving and
behind him ANOTHER and ANOTHER It’s A SMALL ARMY

OF BITTER NOBODIES IN HOODED RIDDLER OUTFITS hidden
above the crowd all meeting here for the very first
time as they secretly prepare to strike

RIDDLER (VO)

RAMMING HIS FACE DOWN HARD AGAIN -- THE GUNMAN CRUMPLES --

Selina moves to Batman -- losing his grip fading -- no
time to lose she leans down grabs his arm -- braces her
heels on the railing -- levering him slowly up -- until
she collapses on the catwalk his body on top of hers

She rolls him onto his back gazing down face close to
his He looks up haunted as if he doesn’t see her as he

struggles to breathe -- when she notices HIS CHEST -- the
blast has torn his armor buckshot lodged in exposed skin
-- alot of blood -- it’s unclear how bad the wound is --
he tries to sit up -- she guides him back down -- growing
emotional -- cradling his face -- soothing --
SELINA
--it’s ok it’s done now

it’s over

Finally he submits -- his eyes now seeing hers -- holding
them -- then gently closing Eyes welling she leans
down to kiss his face his lips as she pulls back

on Selina -- as she rises looking at him grateful

surprised the depth of his feelings for her now exposed
Gordon reaches down pulling the Hood off the SHOOTER --

GORDON
Jesus who the hell are you

UNKNOWN MAN
(grins eerily)

Me I’m Vengeance

Batman turns struck by the sound of his own words in
this killer’s mouth -- WHEN -- A CRASH ECHOES BELOW --

Everyone spins -- EXCEPT BATMAN -- who continues to stare
atthe Man ROCKED -- HOLD ON HIM as the SOUNDS OF PANIC
AND CHAOS FADE AWAY -- when FLICKERING LIGHTS in the
arena pull him out of his trance -- Batman turns to the
others -- COMPLETE SILENCE as DOWN BELOW he SEES --

THE FOUR-STORY GLASS WALL BEHIND THE STAGE SMASHING OPEN

HACKS THE LINE -- SOUND COMES CRASHING BACK -- AS AN
ELECTRICAL BLAST SURGES THROUGH HIM -- JOLTING HIM LOOSE
-- HE DROPS TO THE WATER BELOW SPLASHING INTO IT SELINA
AND GORDON WATCH IN HORROR -- AS ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT --

FOR A MOMENT WE WONDER IS BATMAN DEAD WHEN -- HE
BREAKS THE SURFACE GASPING ALIVE Scans the darkness
around him pulling something from his belt it IGNITES
and we see it’s A FLARE -- THE SOLE SOURCE OF LIGHT NOW
ILLUMINATING THE THOUSANDS IN THE WATER ALL AROUND HIM --

He sees BELLA AND OTHERS trapped in twisted scaffolding
in the STILL-RISING WATER -- he starts quickly toward
them -- climbs the wreckage -- heaving a truss aside to
make an opening to let them all out -- but as he reaches
in Bella and the group hesitate intimidated by Batman’s
haunting wraith-like presence in the flare’s light --

all except a BOY MITCHELLS TEN YEAR OLD SON who
reaches his hand up unafraid Batman pulls him up He
turns to Bella offering a hand again she takes it As

she clings to him the others begin climbing out too --

his cell craning to see the story in complete anguish

UNSEEN PRISONER’S VOICE
Isnt that just terrible Him
raining on your parade like that
What is it they say One day
youre on top the next youre
a clown Well let me tell you
there are worse things to be

Riddler shrinks to the floor totally despondent Then

UNSEEN PRISONERS VOICE
Dont be sad you did so
well And you know Gotham loves
a comeback story

Riddler rises peering out of his cell but can’t see --

RIDDLER
-who who are you

Selina stands at a GRAVE “MARIA KYLE” After a moment
she turns tears in her eyes heading to her bike -- her
stray cats poke their heads out of leather saddle bags --

A VOICE (0S)
--you’re leaving

Selina turns startled to see A FIGURE IN THE SHADOWS --
BATMAN his motorcycle behind him She’s self-conscious

SELINA
Jesus don’t you ever just say
hello

He emerges a sense of unfinished business between them

BATMAN
-- where will you go

SELINA
I dunno upstate Bliidhaven
maybe
(then grins)
Why you asking me to stay

But Batman says nothing She darkens worry in her voice

SELINA
You know this place is never
gonna change With Carmine gone
it’s only gonna get worse for you
-- there’s gonna be a real power
grab -- it’ll be bloody --

BATMAN
I know but the city can change --

SELINA
-- it won’t --

BATMAN
-- I have to try --

SELINA
-- it’s gonna kill you eventually
you know that

SILENCE Then she tries to lighten things -- a smile at
an impossible thought --

102519 (October Shooting Draft) 129

SELINA
-listen why don’t you come with
me Get into some trouble We
could knock off some CEOs Trust-
fund types It’1ll be fun The Bat
and the Cat Got a nice ring

-- when she sees he’s not looking at her she follows his
gaze to the BAT SIGNAL in the clouds -- smiles rueful --

SELINA
Who am I kidding You’re already
spoken for

He looks back at her -- she nods at the sky --

SELINA
You should go --

And then she turns getting on her bike -- when --

BATMAN
Selina

She looks over -- a pregnant silence as they stare --
finally he speaks resigned to letting her go --

BATMAN
Take care of yourself

She nods a sad smile starts her bike heading off
Batman watches her go mounting his he revs the engine
accelerating after her -- and for a moment they chase
through the cemetery echoes of their motorcycle scene

early in the film until they split off opposite ways

ON BATMAN staring hard ahead finally HIS EYES MOVE
TO HIS SIDE MIRROR unable to resist one last look AS
SHE RECEDES His eyes lift again racing toward his
city a look of sheer determination -- we HOLD AS OUR
VIEW ANGRILY VIBRATES WITH HIS EVER INCREASING SPEED
FASTER AND FASTER until we
