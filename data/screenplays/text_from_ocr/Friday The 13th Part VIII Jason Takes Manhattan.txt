FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII JASON TAKES MANHATTAN

Written by Rob Hedden

FADE IN
EXT CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

A dark rumbling sky Haze clings to the lake as we float
across it clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into
view A few scattered streetlights Dilapidated cabins
An abandoned campsite CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

We continue to drift towards it hearing the faint sound
of seductive music and an occasional giggle A small
HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground its interior light
flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside

INT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

A teenage boy and girl JIM and SUZY are slow-dancing
Jims lips softly touch her lissome shoulders

JIM
Wellhow do you feel

SUZY
Ask me in about five minutes

She bites his ear giggles then kisses him fully

JIM
Im talking about graduation Being
totally free to do whatever we want
now

Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt He sighs

SUZY
It feels excellent

Her mouth finds his again After a long kiss he gently
pulls away from her with a teasing smile

JIM
Gotta throw the anchor over

He leaves the cabin She slips under the bed sheets

EXT HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT
as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard

TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE

as the weighty object splashes sinking into black

oblivion pulling its cable down with it

JIM

glances at the lake at their eerie surroundings He

feels a chill heading back inside

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom dropping a few
feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake

silt

INT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

as Jim returns with an uneasy expression He crawls on
top of the bed kissing her again but not with the same

enthusiasm as before

SUZY
Whats wrong

JIM
Nothing

He starts to pull off his shirt and join her
his anxiety

SUZY
Cmon Jimmy Somethings bothering
you

Jim pauses turning off the mood music

JIM
Its just that were right around that
old summer camp where all those
murders took place

The boat creaks Shes instantly nervous

SUZY
What murders

JIM
Never mind you dont want to know
about it

She senses
SUZY
Tell me

JIM
Theres nothing to worry about Suzy
The guys dead now somewhere at the
bottom of this lakeif you believe
the stories
(beat)
Lets drop it okay

He starts to kiss her again She stops him

SUZY
What stories

He doesnt want to go into it but Suzys face insists

JIM
There was this boy named Jason
Voorhees who drowned in Crystal
Lake

FLASHBACK

Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread
water flailing his arms like a marionette to get
attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water

YOUNG JASON
HhhhelpmeIm drowning

JIM (VO)
None of the counselors heard him

YOUNG JASON
Mmmmmmommy

And Jason finally slips under the surface for good
INT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
JIM
A bunch of years went by and everybody
forgot about it
(beat)
Thats when the murders started

FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

as our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted
teenagers just about to die their screams echoing over
each other We do not see the attacker As the
cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo CUT BACK TO

INT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
as the silence hits us hard again

SUZY
Jason did it

JIM
Thats what some people thought But
they were wrong

FLASHBACK (STOCK)

as MRS VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge
knife and a primal scream

INT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

JIM
His mother blamed the counselors for
his death and tried to kill them all
(dramatic pause)
She got her head chopped off by one of
them

We dont need to see this clipSuzys reaction is quite
sufficient

SUZY
So the murders stopped

He gives her a long penetrating look

JIM
No

FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

Were bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked
JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagersbrandishing
everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws Just as

Jason is about to stab us CUT BACK TO

INT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife
JIM
Legend has it that Jason came back to
avenge his mothers death vowing to
kill every teenager from the area
(beat)
And every now and then the murders
start up again

The boat lurches slightly tugging at the anchor cable
Shes scared hes frightened himself a little too

JIM
Forget about it Suzy Theyre just
stories

He brushes her hair back kissing her cheek gently
finding the nape of her neck again She closes her eyes
trying to dismiss what hes dredged up But she cant
Suzy begins to rationalize

SUZY
Were the last graduating class
right

Jims kissing her body putting Jason behind him

JIM
Right

SUZY
I mean Lakeview High just closed its
doors for good right

JIM
Right

SUZY
So theres no reason for him to come
back because there wont be any of us
aroundright

Jim stops looking her squarely in the eyes
JIM
Right Except that Jason isnt real
so none of it matters anyway

She starts to relax returning his kisses

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
as the anchor drifts along the lake floor tugging hard
on the power cable Camera TRACKS along the cable
coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT

INT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

as Jim slides on top of Suzy Thoughts of Jason are
starting to slip away along with their clothes

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the
tugging anchor Camera continues to TRACK againand we

find to our horror that the waterlogged fish-eaten body

of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS (NOTE Jasons

face is obscured)

INT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

Teenagers in love lost in not-so-innocent passion At
the same moment

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE
SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY chasing along the cable finding
the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN
ELECTRICITY

EXT HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)

as BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface
ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable sparking
across the hoist

EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER

as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly
extinguished plunging the campsite into darkness

INT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
as Suzys eyes flash open

SUZY
Did you hear that

JIM
Hear what

He pulls her back down
SUZY
Cmon Im serious

He knows the mood is broken

JIM
All right Ill check it out

He slips on his jeans exiting the cabin She pulls the
sheet up around her fearfully

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

as the cable smolders void of electricity now TRACK to
find the chains againbut theyre dangling loosely
JASON IS GONE

INT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now The black void
of night is all she sees out the cabin door which Jim

has left open An uncomfortable amount of time passes

SUZY
Jimmy

No answer Her heart starts to pound

SUZY
Jim

Again nothing She wraps herself in the sheet moving
towards the open door The ship creaks again

SUZYS POINT OF VIEW

as she grows closer to the doorway nothing but pitch-
black beyond it

SUZY
Stop screwing around Jim I mean
it
And just as she reaches the door

A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER

leaps out clutching a HUGE KNIFE Suzy barely has time
to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST

SUZY
stands there in speechless shock looking down at her
mortal wound But theres no blood

THE MONSTER

pulls the knife back out pushing the blade in and out
with his hand Its a retractable rubber knife JIM
pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin tossing it
aside

JIM
Gotcha good baby cakes

She doesnt know whether to hug him with relief or kick
him in the balls He pulls her back onto the bed
laughing

EXT HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK

sitting dormant on the deck where Jim tossed it A
SHADOW FALLS ACROSS ITfollowed by a SLIMY DECOMPOSING
HAND The hand grabs it like its an old friend pulling
it away

INT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed trying
unsuccessfully to kiss her

JIM
All right all right -- Ima major
ass

SUZY

And youll never do it again

JIM
And Ill never do it again Forgive
me

SUZY
No

Shes resisting only for effect Her legs curl around
him finally giving in

EXT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the
cabin JASONS HAND REMOVES IT
INT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each
other Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now

ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

Nothing there for a momentthen a pair of moss-covered
BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME

SUZY
closes her eyes with pleasure
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

and camera RISES from the mossy feet up the bloodless
legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked
face of our anti-hero JASON VOORHEES

SUZY

lets out a broad smile her eyelids fluttering They stay
open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway
She tries to choke out a warning to Jim whos just
collapsed himself

SUZY
JSTTFTTTIJason

He doesnt follow her glance smiling instead

JIM
Uh-huh You must really think Im an
ass

But she continues to stare in horror as

JASON

raises the spear taking aim

ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM

Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
curdling SCREAM A second later JASON FIRES THE SPEAR
PIERCING HER NECK PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD

Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend not able

to assimilate it quickly enough He spins around to see
the monster himself
JIM
Ohmygod

Jim springs off the bed looking around for anything to
defend himself with grabbing the bedside lamp He
SMASHES IT OVER JASONS HEAD which has little effect Jim
scrambles to get past him but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE
AIR SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS

EXT CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward The lone
silhouette of Jason emerges from within taking the helm
Hes back

FADE IN
EXT HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a
thick blanket of gray fog In the distance speckled
lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP
intermittently appear

EXT DOCKSIDE - DAY

Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH
clipboard in hand Hes just finished checking off a pair
of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS McCulloch is approaching fifty
wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes as well as the
disposition of a stern puritan

MCCULLOCH
Remember girls the shuffleboard
tournament will start at six pm
sharp A non-attendance will restrict
your time in port understood

They nod for his benefit exchanging derogatory whispers
as they head up the ramp Camera ADJUSTS to find a small
parking lot adjacent to the docks where several cars are
just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high
school seniors hugging them bon voyage

CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT

as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES
WOLFE Seans a tall nice looking somewhat serious guy
Miles is shorter athletic and more extroverted
MILES
Youre telling me this boat has a pool
with a three meter board

SEAN
Its a ship and thats right Plus a
disco gym game room and a lot more

MILES
I think Im gonna blow off New York
and just stay on this thing

MCCULLOCH
Youll do no such thing Mr Wolfe

Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch holding his list
checking off their names

MCCULLOCH
Your itinerary has been carefully
planned and make no mistake it will
be executed accordingly

MILES
(under his breath)
Of coursewouldnt want to risk
enjoying this trip

McCulloch gives him a frown Sean steps up to him
tentatively

SEAN
Which cabin is Rennie in Mr
McCulloch

MCCULLOCH

Rennies not coming
Hes devastated

SEAN
But I thought

MCCULLOCH
She changed her mind
(eyeing list)
Lets seeMr Wolfe is in stateroom
one-eleven and you Mr Robertson are
in two-twenty-five

A booming VOICE from above interrupts them
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (0S)

Sean -- where the hell have you been
Were already into early departure
protocol

ANOTHER ANGLE

Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense uniformed
Navy man ADMIRAL ROBERTSON The captain of the ship And
Seans father Seans sadness about Rennies absence is
immediately replaced with anxiety

SEAN
Be right up Dad

He and Miles head up the gangway both boys giving
McCulloch one last glare

INT 76 BMW 2002 - DAY

Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN thirties
attractive a progressive attitude RENNIE WICKHAM sits
next to her -- shes seventeen pretty slightly
withdrawn Rennies dog TOBY a border collie rides in
the back seat

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Im glad you decided to come after

all

RENNIE
Me too But Im not sure Uncle Charles
will be

MISS VAN DEUSEN
You let me worry about him okay
(pause)
Personal experiences are what fuel the
minds of great writers Rennie You
made the right decision

RENNIE
What about not-so-great writers

Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly Miss Van Deusen
grinning back But Rennies smiles are few and far
between this one disappearing as she glances out the
window

RENNIES POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)
as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread
out before her eery in the bog A small ROWBOAT grazes
across it occupied by two indistinguishable people

RETURN TO SHOT

Rennies eyes show a hidden terror She quickly turns
away shivering briefly Miss Van Deusen notices She
turns a corner heading into the parking lot

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Everything okay

RENNIE
Just felt a little chill

Rennie rubs her arms faking coldness

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Did you know that Im giving up
teaching

RENNIE

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Since the school is closing anyway

been threatening on everybody

RENNIE
Thats wonderful Miss Van
Deusenwhats it about

fq

She parks the car turning off the ignition

MISS VAN DEUSEN
A senior class cruise to Manhattan
laced with romance adventure and
murder

(beat)
Or a Gothic cook book I havent
decided which

Shes coaxed the smile out of Rennie again Miss Van
Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove
compartment handing it to Rennie who seems utterly
surprised

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Go on open it
Rennie pops off the lid revealing an antique ink-dip
pen

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Stephen King supposedly used it when
he was in high school

RENNIE
I dont know what to say

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Rennie youre the best student I ever
hadyou have a real gift If anybody
can make use of that pen its you

Rennie hugs her teacher Camera RISES above the cars
window finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short
distance away

CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES

A sexy money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel TAMARA
MASON She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of
SENIOR GIRLS walk by offering enthusiastic his and
hellos Shes obviously Miss Popular Tamara crosses to a
cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda
EVA WATANABE

TAMARA
Are you ready for drugs sex and rock
n roll or what girl

Eva gives her a warning glance nodding to her left
Evas MOTHER appears by the passenger door forcing a
smile at Tamara

MRS WATANABE
Hello Tamara

TAMARA
Hi Mrs Watanabe Just kidding

MRS WATANABE

Embarrassed Eva hurries to her Mom rushing a kiss

Before Mrs Watanabe can squeeze a word in her daughter

Tamara unzips her purse revealing a baggie filled with
fine white powder Eva looks very nervous

TAMARA
Its my graduation gift from Daddy It
cost over a thousand bucks but its
the best

EVA
He bought you that

TAMARA
More or less Its part of my college
fund

She grins coquettishly walking on Camera HOLDS on the
calm foggy harborwhere the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT
is aimlessly drifting into port

CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT
Sure enough its the same one we saw JASON on last
nightbut no one is behind the helm It seems to be a

ghost ship

EXT DOCKSIDE - DAY
as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch busy with another
pair of seniors

MCCULLOCH
You can stop right there Miss Mason

He motions the others onward Busted Tamara instantly
hands Eva her drug-filled purse paralyzing Eva

MCCULL40CH
Only graduating seniors are allowed on
this cruise

TAMARA
What are you talking about

TAMARA

(turning to Eva)
Congratulations on the 39 average

Eva smiles awkwardly reaching for her luggage stalling
to see what happens with Tamara

TAMARA
Look Mr McCulloch I got in a car
accident yesterday and missed our
appointment Its okay no big deal

today Its in my suitcase Really

He looks at her suitcase not buying a word of this
EVA
Shes telling the truth Mr
McCulloch I saw her pack it

Hes surprised to hear thisand so is Tamara

MCCULLOCH
All right But if it mysteriously
disappears en route Ill have you
sent back home the minute we dock
Understood

TAMARA
Perfectly

She grabs her purse back from Eva quickly moving on
before he changes his mind Their voices become whispers

TAMARA
A major prick

EVA
What are you going to do

TAMARA
Improvise of course

EXT DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME

as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered
dock pilings still around fifty yards from the cruise
ship

POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW

The window is splattered with blood but still clear
enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway
along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on
board

TIGHT ON HOUSEBOATS ANCHOR CABLE

--or rather the remnants of it Its a piece of frayed
woven metal charred by extreme electricity severed just
above water level Suddenly theres blurry movement
behind it camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a
glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE FLOATING TOWARDS
THE PILINGS

EXT DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME

as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again
Miss Van Deusen walks up to him

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Hello Charles Has everyone checked
in

MCCULLOCH
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never
showed up Im a little concerned

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Dont be They probably decided to
explore each other rather than New
York

He gives her a disdainful look starting up the ramp

MCCULLOCH
Lets go -- were running two minutes
late

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Charles theres someone else coming
along too

He stops following her glance His face tightens

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase her
dog Toby striding next to her She walks up to him
starts to say something then decides against it Rennie
heads up the gangway HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van
Deusen Hes livid

MCCULLOCH
You have no right

MISS VAN DEUSEN
And neither do you Its up to Rennie
to decide what she wants to do

MCCULLOCH
She doesnt know what she wants Shes
never had a stable life

MISS VAN DEUSEN
And she sure doesnt have one now
either She needs to live

MCCULLOCH
Im her legal guardian not you or
anybody else and I alone know whats
best for her End of discussion

MISS VAN DEUSEN
No I think its just the beginning

She walks past him
EXT RAMPSHIP - ON RENNIE

as she reaches the top of the gangway her heart
pounding Rennie pauses working up the courage to look
out at the lake again

RENNIES POINT OF VIEW

The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there even closer
now

RENNIES PUPILS

contract her blood pumping faster Then she hears a
FAINT VOICE BELOW HER

VOICE (0S)
Hhhhelp me

Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and
sees

AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY

floundering in the water It takes us only a moment to
recognize him -- ITS YOUNG JASON Hes gasping sucking
in huge amounts of liquid exactly like he did in the
prologue

YOUNG JASON
Hhhhelp meIm drowning

RENNIE
leans back in terror falling into Miss Van Deusen

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Whats wrong Rennie

Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge unable to
speak Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees

MISS VAN DEUSENS POINT OF VIEW
The water is calm No Young Jason
RETURN TO SHOT

as Rennie gets a hold of herself

RENNIE
I just got a little dizzy Im fine

She continues up the ramp HOLD on Miss Van Deusen
watching her go somewhat troubled by it RACK to
McCulloch below her also watching Extremely concerned

RENNIE

continues along the starboard side not risking another
glance overboard She passes an older very deranged DECK
HAND mopping the deck HOLD on him his bloodshot eyes
following her like a crazed raven

INT BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY

Sharp and rusty mounted on the wall amidst jagged
scaling knives shark jaws and other artifacts WIDEN to
reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the
cruise ships bridge Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF
ENGINEER are preparing for departure checking the OMEGA
satellite computer as well as the LORAN

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
(checking watch)
Lets take in the brow

CHIEF ENGINEER
Yes Sir
(into intercom phone)
Take in the gangway and single up all
lines

SEAN and MILES enter the room Sean gets a glance from
his Dad Miles is very impressed with the bridge

SEAN
Hello Dad

MILES
Hey Admiral Robertson Love your
ship

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Shes a beauty isnt she I shouldve
retired from the Navy ten years ago

MILES
Youve really been generous to give us
this cruise I know I speak for
everybody on board

Everybodywith the possible exception of Sean He
avoids eye contact with his father

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Hell theres just twenty or so of you
-- we only need a skeleton crew and
its a pleasure to sail her anyway
(beat)

By the way congratulations on winning
the intramural diving championships
Miles Im sure you made your old man
proud

Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance maybe Sean
should think about doing the same

CHIEF ENGINEER
Have you decided on your departure
protocol Admiral

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Actually I thought Id leave the
honors to my son

SEAN
Dad I dont think

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
(to Chief Engineer ignoring
Sean)
Relinquishing command of the Princess
Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson

Sean has no say in the matter Miles can feel his
friends nervousness as well

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
But before you take the helm take
this

He tosses Sean a wrapped box Sean opens it Inside is a
navigational computer the size of a calculator sitting
next to a rusty old sextant

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Something old and something new I
used the sextant when I was your age
but now they have these goddamn
computers to do all the work for you

CHIEF ENGINEER
(to Sean)
Have you decided on a plan of
departure Captain

Seans nervous He eyes the Omega quickly glancing at
the LORAN briefly referring to the navigational chart

SEAN
How about if we start up the forward
engines and come around 180
degrees

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Arent you forgetting something

Sean looks flustered Admiral Robertson storms to a
large button pressing it three times piercing the air
with three long blasts of the ships horn It
underscores his frustration

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Were in foggy weather Send out the
international maritime signal that a
vessel is backing down followed by a
security broadcast warning other
ships

He shoves the mike out at Sean but he doesnt grab it
leaving the bridge humiliated Theres an awkward moment
for Miles unable to find any appropriate words He exits
as well Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window
saddened and frustrated It wasnt supposed to go this
way

EXT DECK - ON SEAN

as he continues away his retreat blocked by the DECK
HAND The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at
Sean

DECK HAND
This voyage is doomed

SEAN
Yeah tell me about it

Sean sidesteps him moving on
EXT HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)

Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as
CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers
lining the upper deck happily waving back The ship
begins to slice through serene water The voyage has
begun

CLOSER ON HULL

The water begins to ripple as the ships speed increases
All seems normaluntil JASONS HANDS APPEAR CLINGING
TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER He
slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog
breezes past him

EXT DECK - DAY
as Sean continues along hands in pockets He turns a

corner and collides with RENNIE walking her dog His
eyes instantly brighten as do hers

SEAN
Rennie

RENNIE
Hi Sean

SEAN

I heard you werent coming

RENNIE

(glances at Toby)
We changed our minds

Sean pats her dog Theres an awkward pausethey are
obviously in the early stages-of a relationship

Sean reaches into his coat pocket bringing back a small
necklace-sized box

SEAN
I got you a present

RENNIE
But I didnt get you one

SEAN
Forget it Its a dumb little thing
anyway

Rennie opens it up exposing a petite silver necklace
with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it Shes touched

RENNIE
Seanits beautiful
Sean takes it from her snapping it around her neck

SEAN
I thought maybe we could hike to the
top of the Statue when we got there
if you felt like it Its supposed to
be 22 stories tall

RENNIE
Id love to

MCCULLOCH (0S)
Your father was looking for you Mr
Robertson

McCulloch appears behind them The mood has been broken

SEAN
I guess Ill see you later

Sean leaves McCulloch steps up to Rennie pointing out

to the

foggy sea Her respiration increases as she

psyches herself up to look

Rennie
away

MCCULLOCH
Theres a storm predicted tonight

looks at the ocean forcing herself not to turn

MCCULLOCH
Youre making a big mistake Rennie
Its not too late to put you back on
land

RENNIE
Im staying

MCCULLOCH
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you
were of

RENNIE
She didnt push me into coming

MCCULLOCH
Why are you doing this to yourself

RENNIE
I dont even know why Im afraid
Uncle Charles I cant even remember
when it started Dont you think its
time I found out and got over it
He takes a measured pause

MCCULLOCH
Facing your fear doesnt always
conquer it

RENNIE
Im staying

Hes not going to change her mind
POV - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B and WVIEWFINDER MATTE)

through a porthole windowand through the viewfinder

of a video camcorder McCulloch shakes his head turning
away from Rennie and walking away A sinister electric
guitar solo screeches out PAN with McCulloch as he
passes the window coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE
UP of JJ JARRETT fingering a sleek Gibson Flying V

JJ
(into camera)
Is this axe awesome or what

INT JJS STATEROOM - DAY

as JJ a female rocker in the vein of band Vixen
continues to wail on her guitar Shes wearing a black
leather corset with wildly teased deep red hair Holding
the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER MTV-acclimated wearing
the latest hip prescription glasses

WAYNE
Too cool JJ Your parents came
through

She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp

JJ
No lie I hear theres a big power
room down below where I can get
supreme concert hall echo Come down
and shoot a basement tape on me okay

WAYNE
Surebut I gotta shoot some
shockumentary footage first

He avoids eye contact when he says it She gives him a
look
Jd
Man dont tell me youre still trying
to scam on Tamara

His non-answer means yes JJ walks over to him
grabbing his cheeks shaking them like jello

JJ
How long have we known each other
Dont be a dweeb Wayne Shes not
interested in you only what you can
do for her Shes a user

WAYNE
Shes sexy

JJ

WAYNE

He exits She mumbles something under her breath coiling
up her amp cord

INT CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE

as he walks onward DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he
passes a DARK ALCOVEwhich happens to have SLIMY
FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it Camera FOLLOWS
the footprints RISING again and with dim recognition
our eyes fall on JASON Lurking in the shadows But not
for long

INT POWER ROOM - DAY

Massive very dark backlit steam seeping from a maze of
pipes overhead No windows A wall of circuit breakers
and voltage meters decorate one wall quietly humming
generators on the opposite side JJ appears with her
guitar amp and ghetto blaster appreciative of the
surroundings

JJ
This place is aching for a video

Wayne youre an asshole

She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment
JASONS POINT OF VIEW

Were peering at JJ predatorially through the steam
moving through it behind the generators

JJ

pops a cassette into her blaster jamming the play
button A loud rock n roll rhythm track blasts out

JASONS POINT OF VIEW

moving around the generators eyeing her sleek leather
pants as she bends over to plug in her axe

TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR

as JJ snaps the male end of the plug into the female
receptacle

JASONS FACE
appears for an instant through the vapor then vanishes
Jd

screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with
her playback The generators are causing a breeze which
makes her hair dance steam flowing between her legs
Shes lost in her music building to a crescendo bending
the high E string above the upper octave fret She
opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees

JASON
emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare
EXT UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

as JJs SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct WHIP PAN to
find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it
reacting with dread Hes the only one who has heard it

INT POWER ROOM - SAME TIME

as Jason tears the guitar off her body raising it in the
air like a hatchet The horrified girl flees down a
narrow maze of steel steps forced back against a
generator with nowhere to go PUSH IN on her face for one
last look at her before

JASON
swings the guitar downward and buries it in JJs skull
EXT UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick dull sound of
her demise followed by discordant feedback from her
guitarand eventual silence He reaches into his breast

MISS VAN DEUSEN
After your parents passed away

Rennie nods somberly

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Did you have an accident in the lake

RENNIE
No It was just a normal summer Ive
never been able to figure it out

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Only one young boy ever drowned in
that lake and that was before you
were even born His name was Jason
Voorhees

The name has triggered some deep memorybut the
recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncles
voice

The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune

curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out
onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR A flashing Star Wars
lighting system assaults her all directions along with
the music Shes all alone in here

terror She spots another door on a small stage rushing

to it Its locked

gone

backs away sliding along the edge of the dance floor
like shes on a building ledge Chaser lights and mirror
balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the
point where she last saw him But

illuminates only ten feet from her a crimson strobe
assaulting his hockey mask Shes on a collision course
with him

whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the
sight of him Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs
PUSHING IN on her face

of Jason materializing where she least expects to see
him And getting closer Finally at the point of
exhaustion

as McCulloch faces her angrily grabbing Rennies arms
shouting over the storm

MCCULLOCH
You had me worried to death

RENNIE
But Sean said

MCCULLOCH
Im the one you should be listening
to Do you think dropping an anchor in
the middle of a storm makes any sense
whatsoever

She tries to find some defense but McCulloch leads her
off before any wards come forth

been seeing

He avoids eye contact McCulloch takes her hand ushering
her across the threshold Shes standing inside her room

now hes in the hallway

MCCULLOCH

finally becoming crisp WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER --
the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier
Hes holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set
not a knife

WAYNE

slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his
throat

WAYNE
No

He raises his camcorder again hoping a second view will
reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man

WAYNES POINT OF VIEW (B and WVIEWFINDER MATTE)

He gets half his wish a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS
FRAMEbut Jason is far from dead Wayne catches a split-
second glimpse of Jasons fist coming towards him then
the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES
DARK AND BLURRY

screams blindly running as fast as he can He trips
picking himself up stumbling down the catwalk stairs
Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over

They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch
storms onto the bridge

Did you find Rennie

MCCULLOCH
Shes locked safe in her room no

Has he brought it back on course yet

Sean doesnt look at him still trying to assimilate the
wall of components

MISS VAN DEUSEN
Hes doing the best he can Charles

MCCULLOCH
Hes the son of the Captain for
Chrissakes Youd think hed be able
to operate this thing

Sean closes his eyes trying to keep from losing his mind
and temper A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of
Seans face motivating him to get his shit together He
checks the Omega and LORAN

MCCULLOCH
Well

Sean doesnt answer moving to the seat behind the helm

wheel watching the compass He studies a series of
buttons on the console

could possibly see it in this storm

Theres only one person who needs to
see it And Im going to find him

MISS VAN DEUSEN
What about the fire

MCCULLOCH
I doubt very much that one even

MISS VAN DEUSEN

fire alarm causes panicthe same
kind of panic caused by suggesting
Jason Voorhees is on board

Enough is enough

He marches out the door Sean finds the alarm kill

grabs a pair of rain jackets tossing one to Miss Van

than the last

Godplease no

But Jason keeps on coming

RENNIE
Somebody help us Hes going to kill
us

But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her
bustling onward Rennie and Sean have no choice but to
flee again

JASON

shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians
theyve certainly seen weirder characters than him here
He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some
rap from their ghetto blaster His foot obliterates

their stereo system with one stride They instantly pull
out switchblades and chains

STREET URCHIN
Youre dead meat slime bag

Jason stops turning around towering over the kids He
has blood and gore caked everywhere his skin charred
from the electrocution Jason starts to remove his mask
facing them squarely

out tossing it aside The Bikers face goes wan backing
away

strangers in a very strange land

another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE

the wrench as frightened as they are

I sure can and we dont have a minute
to waste

He begins quickly packing up his tools

out with the stuff on the 13th of
every month right at midnight

her fears

directly into it
