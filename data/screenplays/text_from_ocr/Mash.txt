EXT LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077th MASH — DAY

Our attention is concentrated on a sign reading THIS IS WHERE IT
IS — PARALLEL 38 Below these words arrows point to NORTH KOREA
in one direction SOUTH KOREA in opposite one Two Air Rescue
helicopters are coming in low from the north descending to a point
just outside the entrance to the hospital Admitting Ward
Transferring our attention to the helicopters our gaze goes from
the first sign to a second one on which all we can read at first
are the very large letters M-A-S-H Moving closer to the
helicopters as they hit the ground we can make out the rest of the
sign Above the four large letters it says 4077TH and then we
see there is the remainder of a word following each of the large
letters but in much smaller print so that M-A-S-H becomes
Mobile Army Surgical Hospital The helicopters land and enlisted
men of the US Army Medical Corps Carry two wounded soldiers from
each into the Admitting Ward

LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE a permanent member of the Medical
Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th watches grimly as the
wounded are borne from the helicopters into his hospital CORPORAL
RADAR OREILLY with a long thin neck large ears and a knack for
anticipating his Colonels wishes moves up close behind him

HENRY
(loudly)
OReilly

RADAR
(at his side)
Yes sir

HENRY
Dammit Radar wait till I call you Tell
Major Burns

RADAR
One of the surgeons from the day shift will
have to stay on duty tonight

HENRY
Yes dammit and

He interrupts himself frightened by the intense expression on
Radars face The Corporals head is turning back and forth like an
actual radar receiver monitoring the northern horizon where the
valley of a river meanders between mountainous ridges

HENRY
OReilly what is it
(appalled at the thought)
There arent more choppers coming

RADAR
Im afraid so Colonel
HENRY
Weve got too many wounded for us to handle
now Get on the phone right away and

RADAR
Yes sir Ill see if I can reach General
Hammond in Seoul for you You think hell
finally break down and give us two more
surgeons

The DISTANT SOUND of more HELICOPTERS becomes faintly audible to the
normal human ear and a moment later one appears over a ridge

TIME LAPSE

EXT MOTOR POOL AND RAILROAD DEPOT — 325TH EVACUATION HOSPITAL —
YONG-DONG-PA — DAY

Two officers come from opposite directions toward a Jeep each
carrying a Valpac and trailing a barracks bag Though they still
wear such later-to-be-discarded refinements as captains bars on
their caps and overcoats they are far from West Point standards in
dress and manner DUKE 29 is still solidly built like the fullback
he once was HAWKEYE 28 a former end is taller and rangier wears
glasses Their accents Georgia and Maine respectively are in sharp
contrast A MOTOR POOL SARGEANT who has driven the Jeep up climbs
out

MOTOR POOL DRIVER
You the guys going to the 4077th

DUKE
Im one of ‘em

HAWKEYE
(state of Maine
affirmative)
Ayuh Im the other then
As they stow their gear in the back of the Jeep

MOTOR POOL SARGEANT
Lots of luck

He leaves

HAWKEYE
My names Hawkeye Pierce

DUKE
Duke Forrest

Hawkeye takes the drivers seat Duke getting into the right-hand
side has no objection just a question

DUKE
You got directions
HAWKEYE
Ayuh only its early I need a drink to wake
me up

DUKE
I got some

He turns around and opens his barracks bag where he finds a pint
bottle conveniently located near the top

HAWKEYE
Make it yourself or is it real

DUKE
Georgia where I come from its real if you
make it yourself But I been buying from the
Yankee Government since they put me in this
soldier suit and give me a rate

HAWKEYE
Tax-free booze Its about all you can say
for army life

DUKE
(passing bottle)
Where you from with that crazy way of
talking

HAWKEYE
Crabapple Cove Maine

DUKE
Damn That must be about as far north as you
can get

HAWKEYE

Pretty near What do you know about the
outfit were going to

DUKE
cO is Colonel Blake Lieutenant Colonel
Henry Braymore Blake One of them regular
army clowns Push you around so its hard to
get any decent work done

HAWKEYE
We got to head them off right at the start
Push them around first

They have exchanged the bottle a couple of times In the act of
raising it to his mouth Hawkeye looks toward the hospital doorway

HAWKEYE
I think we already caught their eye

Two MPs have emerged from the hospital administration offices and
are heading toward them Hawkeye goes into action quickly starting
the Jeep engine
DUKE
Whats the initials MP stand for Hawkeye

HAWKEYE
Shore Patrol Duke Lets go

The Jeep starts off at its maximum takeoff speed and accelerates
dangerously as it careens out of the hospital grounds

TIME LAPSE

EXT ROAD NEAR OUIJONGBU — DAY

Hawkeye and Duke are driving the Jeep along the muddy road — they
come upon a sign which fills a large part of the screen Last
chance before Peking A short distance behind the sign it is now
revealed are three parked US Army trucks in front of which
parades a group of Korean prostitutes from fourteen to forty-five
Despite the autumn weather their costumes mixed American mail
order and Korean are chosen for seductive appeal rather than
warmth

HAWKEYE
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore —
(pronounced howah )
House You in the market Duke

DUKE
(in negation)
I done my shopping in Seoul last night

They now have a fairly clear view of a GI and a Korean female lying
in tight formation in the bed on one of the trucks their activity
only partially concealed by a blanket

DUKE
Curb service is right

TIME LAPSE

EXT APPROACH TO 4077TH MASH — DAY

Hawkeye stops the Jeep as they come to a place in the road where
they can get a downward look at their future home The river valley
in which the 4077th Mash is situated is almost surrounded by
mountains The components of the post are spread out in a rough
horseshoe with a large compound of level ground in the middle At
the closed end of the horseshoe is the main hospital building made
of wood with a tin roof marked by a large red cross everything else
is canvas To the left of the main building are strung out the
Admitting Ward Laboratory Dental Clinic Mess Hall PX Showers
Tent Barber Tent and the Enlisted Mens Tents On the right side
are the Postop Ward Officers Tents Nurses Tents Korean
Domestics Tents and finally the Officers Club In the fg from
Duke and Hawkeyes angle are four helicopters belonging to the 5th
Air Rescue Squadron and the signs we have already seen marking the
post and the 38th Parallel
HAWKEYE
Well there it is Jesus

DUKE
The spot we picked to spend the winter Maybe
we ought to look a little harder

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT MASH MESS HALL — DAY

As Hawkeye and Duke enter The large tent has two floor levels
separated by a railing into a section for officers and one for
enlisted men the two groups being much closer to numerical equality
here than in an ordinary military installation There is a further
voluntary piece of segregation within the officers section the men
— medical officers plus a couple of administrative officers and a
helicopter pilot — are at one long rectangular table the nurses
ranging in rank from second lieutentant to captain at another

Hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the officers
section but Duke calls his attention to the outstanding feature of
the nurses table LIEUTENTANT DISH 24 blonde and clearly even in
her winter fatigues the sexiest looking nurse in military history

DUKE
What do you think of that piece of scenery
Yankee boy

HAWKEYE
Finest kind Well sit where we can get the
best view

Accordingly they select seats close to the nurses and facing the
Lieutenant Some personnel are on duty in the hospital during this
lunch period but beside Dish two of the following three nurses
with whom we will become acquainted are present here

KNOCKO who is black a captain in her thirties solidly built very
strong and very competent in her job LESLIE also a captain not
more than thirty bright attractive cheerful the kind of girl
that brings out the latent male matrimonial instinct but who
strangely is treated as inviolate by the by the sex-starved men of
the post and LIEUTENANT SCORCH who cant match Dish or Leslie by
physical standards but has the asset of instant availability

A Korean boy not yet of military age in green fatigue pants and an
off-white coat appears promptly and heaps Duke and Hawkeyes plates
with food Duke is hungry enough to turn his whole attention to the
meal but Hawkeye is unable to keep his eyes off Lieutenant Dish
while eating Thus neither of them is aware of the attention they
are getting from the male officers group which includes HENRY a
couple of medical captains named MURRHARDT and BANDINI DAGO RED
(officially Father John Patrick Mulcahy red-haired Catholic
Chaplain of the area) and the PAINLESS POLE (Captain Walter
Zaldowski Dental Officer) both in their thirties and CAPTAIN UGLY
JOHN BLACK an Australian anesthesiologist
There is also curiousity about the newcomers from the unlisted mens
section where we see among others RADAR VOLLMER Henrys
overweight Sargeant Major CORPORAL JUDSON young black and fresh
from Mississippi PRIVATE BOONE who looks too young and nervous to
be in any mans army and PFC SEIDMAN whose first trip out of New
York has taken him halfway around the world

Henry who alone has reason to be personally affronted by Duke and
Hawkeyes unmilitary behavior gets up and crosses to where they are

sitting

HENRY
Im Colonel Blake You fellows just passing
through

HAWKEYE
Nope were assigned heah

With which reminder we will abandon all indications of the Maine

accent

Henry scans
part There

DUKE
Yall were short a couple cutters and were
what the Army sent

HENRY
Dont you know the first thing youre
supposed to do at a new post is present
yourself to the commanding officer with your
orders

DUKE
Reckon so but we been boozing all day and
you work up an appetite

HENRY
(taking out orders and
handing Duke a copy)
Youre welcome to one of these whatever they
are

DUKE
(finding his orders)
They give you copies to burn

both papers to find what he considers the most important
is a RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY in the distance

HENRY
Good Youve both been working close to the
front

DUKE
(listening to artillery)
Never this close
HENRY
Theyve hit us on Cherry Hill I just got
word We have our slack periods but when the
action starts youll have more work in
twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in

a week
HAWKEYE
Colonel Blake have no fear Hawkeye and Duke
are here
DUKE
(to Henry)

Thats right pal You just sit up front and
sign the mail and leave the cutting to us

HENRY
I may need you to go to work practically
immediately But meanwhile perhaps youd like
to meet some of your fellow officers

DUKE
Just one for a start

HAWKEYE
The blonde dish

HENRY
If you mean
(looking toward Lieutenant
Dish)
She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing
Corps Captain

HAWKEYE
Okay Lieutenant Dish I guess shes
already involved with somebody here

HENRY
Theyve all tried Nobodys got to first
base

He is interrupted by the fact that Dish and Knocko have risen from
their table and are passing right by them on their way to the door
The Lieutenant has just as nice a walk as you would hope for and
the mens eyes follow her till she is again out of hearing distance

HAWKEYE
Why bother with first base Id go right for
the home run

The Painless Pole and Dago Red have come over

DAGO RED
This the new talent Henry

HENRY
Captain Pierce Captain Forrest Father
Mulcahy the Catholic Chaplain of the area
and Captain Waldowski our Dental Officer
PAINLESS
Better known as Painless Pole

Murrhardt and Bandini come over and all ADLIB introductions — asking
each other their backgrounds etc

BANDINI
We all call him Dago Red

DUKE
Im Duke and hes Hawkeye

PAINLESS
Glad to know you Drop in at my clinic
anytime you feel like playing a little poker
or even if a tooth is bothering you

HAWKEYE
Poker sounds great When do you play

MURRHARDT
He said anytime Day and night seven days a
week The players change but the game never
stops

HENRY
(to Hawkeye and Duke)
Youll be living with Major Burns OReilly

Before his name is uttered Radar has already risen from the
enlisted mens group and is now at Henrys side

RADAR
Sir

HENRY
Dont do that Radar You make me nervous

RADAR
Sir

HENRY
Dont come so quickly when I call I want you
to take these officers

RADAR
To Major Burns tent Yes sir

HENRY
Stop that ORielly

RADAR
Sir

HENRY
Oh get out of here

RADAR
Yes Colonel
BRIEF TIME LAPSE

EXT INT THE SWAMP (PRESENTLY FRANKS TENT) — DAY

Hawkeye and Duke drag their bags from the Jeep which Radar drives
away They look over their new residence a standard army tent
square with peaked roof a wooden door attached to the canvas Then
as they approach it they become aware of a youthful Korean voice
reading in heavily accented English words that have no meaning for
the speaker

HO-JONS VOICE (0S)
‘Yea though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death

DUKE
Jesus Christ

HAWKEYE
One of his ancestors I think

HO-JONS VOICE (0S)
‘I shall fear no evil for Thou art with me

They open the door of the tent and go in There are three canvas
cots with sleeping bags on them a plank floor an oil stove
electric light a few crude shelves one table and one chair plus
assorted crates serving as same

MAJOR FRANK BURNS 35 from Wisconsin is sitting on one of the two
more favorably situated cots listening to HO-JON a Korean boy of
16 read from the Bible He corrects the word that has given Ho-Jon
the most trouble

FRANK
Thou For Thou art with me
(sees Duke and Hawkeye
jumps up)
Welcome welcome welcome

DUKE
What the hells going on here

FRANK
This is Ho-Jon my houseboy Our houseboy
Im teaching him English

DUKE
Wheres he gonna use that kind of talk The
valley of the shadow of death Wait a
minute Ho-Jon
(rummages in barracks bag)
I got something for you

He takes out sex magazine gives it to Ho-Jon in such a way that we
see the nude on the cover but Frank doesnt
DUKE

(to Frank)
Little light reading matter Just right for
his age
HAWKEYE
(to Duke)

Well southern boy I suppose you want the
sack thats convenient to the door

DUKE
And gets the wind every time it opens No
thanks Ill take that one

He indicates the unoccupied cot which like Franks is at the rear
of the tent with the stove between it and the front door Hawkeye
shrugs and reaches into his barracks bag

HAWKEYE
Lets choose for it
(finds baseball bat hands
it to Duke)
You toss

Duke tosses the bat vertically in the air As it comes down Hawkeye
grabs it expertly at the tape with his left hand Duke puts his left
hand above that and Duke is left with his right hand waving in the
air with nothing to grab

HAWKEYE
(to Ho-Jon)
Part of your education Always use your own
bat

He tosses Valpac onto the desired cot

TIME LAPSE

INT ADMITTING WARD — NIGHT

Its pretty full already and more wounded are being brought in by
corpsmen In contrast to the opening scene where the casualties
were a generalized fact seen at a distance in this scene they are
viewed individually and at close range and the effect both on the
eye and the ear is almost unbearable Hawkeye in a white gown as
are all the surgeons and nurses moves from a patient he has just
examined to one who is letting out a number of unintelligible SOUNDS
mixed in with such clear and frequently repeated words as Christ
Mother God damn and Please As Hawkeye approaches
Lieutentant Scorch removes enough of the bandaging done in the field
to display an abdomen with part of its contents on the outside

HAWKEYE
Two-man job How much blood has he had

LIEUTENANT SCORCH
Second pint
HAWKEYE
Duke

Duke has just examined a patient He takes a step towards Hawkeye

HAWKEYE
This kids ready but we wont know all the
damage till we get in and see whats
happened What have you got

DUKE
Nothing cant wait Shall we check it out
with the Major

He indicates a Major who is standing a short distance away looking
like a boss but not actually doing anything Also in Admitting Ward
are Murrhardt Lieutentant Dish PFC Seidman Corporal Judson

HAWKEYE
Naw I already found out The only thing he
doesnt like about being in charge is making
decisions

TIME LAPSE

INT OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

NOTE All principal cast should be available for all operating
scenes

There are three operations going on at once Here all personnel wear
white caps and masks and it is hard to identify individuals except
that at close range we can distinguish Hawkeye by his glasses and
Duke by his eyes and his build They are working together with great
efficiency and an instinctive collaboration that seems to require no
verbal exchange What we see them do without necessarily
recognizing the portion of anatomy involved is to cut out a section
of bowel damaged by a shell fragment and start sewing the divided
ends together

TIME LAPSE

INT OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

Hawkeye and Duke are working together on the last stages of a leg
amputation This time there is no doubt about the surgical process
we are watching we see the almost severed leg and the process of
controlling bleeding then the limb is actually separated from its
stump and handed by Duke to a corpsman Hawkeye speaks to the nurse
standing behind him

HAWKEYE
Hot pack

Watching her dip the pack into a warm solution and wring it out he
recognizes despite cap and mask that it is Lieutenant Dish His
eyes linger on hers for a brief moment
TIME LAPSE

EXT OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

Lieutenant Dish comes out of the Operating Room tears in her eyes
trying to control her sobs and moves just outside the circle of
light from the fixture over the entrance There no longer under
observation she lets herself cry Hawkeye comes out the door
registers surprise at the sight of her just as if he hadnt followed
her out He moves to her side and puts a comforting arm around her
She looks up just long enough to see who it is then buries her head
on his shoulder as his other arm goes around her

LIEUTENANT DISH
Isnt this ridiculous Doctor Six months
Ive been here and there are still times when
I cant stand it I just go to pieces

HAWKEYE
Theres nothing ridiculous about it
(turns her face up to his)
A kid like you

She doesnt move her head from the way he has arranged it and her
lips are very close to his He kisses her and it turns out from the
ardent way she responds thats what she wanted him to do

LIEUTENANT DISH
Thank you Captain Pierce
(her voice full of need)
Its been so long

HAWKEYE
No trouble at all
(then)
Hawkeye

LIEUTENANT DISH
How did you get called that

HAWKEYE
‘The Last of the Mohicans Only book my
father ever read

He kisses her again and again she clings to him

LIEUTENANT DISH
Youre getting a workout you and Captain
Forrest your first night

HAWKEYE
It isnt always this rough

LIEUTENANT DISH
Oh no We have dull stretches every week or
so thank God when theres nothing to do
after midnight
HAWKEYE
They dont have to be dull I mean if you and
me put our minds together

LIEUTENANT DISH
Our minds

HAWKEYE
For a start I just have a hunch well it
isnt entirely a hunch

LIEUTENANT DISH
Youre an attractive man

HAWKEYE
You have a certain modest charm yourself

LIEUTENANT DISH
(continuing her own
thoughts)
But Im married

HAWKEYE
Something else we have in common

LIEUTENANT DISH
Very happily married

HAWKEYE
Same here

LIEUTENANT DISH
And absolutely determined to be faithful to
my husband Do we have that in common
Captain

HAWKEYE
Its a matter of definition Faithful in
spirit yes

LIEUTENANT DISH
I dont make the distinction But the sex
urge is a powerful force In women just as
much as men

HAWKEYE
Ayuh

LIEUTENANT DISH
Youd think now with only six weeks before
they ship me back home it would be easier
But it isnt

HAWKEYE
Of course not

LIEUTENANT DISH
Its terribly hard Sometimes the temptation
is just too much
HAWKEYE
Then why not as long as it wouldnt hurt
anybody

LIEUTENANT DISH

(not hearing him just

continuing her own

thought)
But youve made me feel strong again
Captain Hawkeye

(smiling tears gone

ready to return to work)
You helped me pull together when I needed it

With a grateful look at him she goes back inside Hawkeye
contemplates the accomplishment she has credited him with and finds
it appalling

INT OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

Hawkeye and Duke are working across the table from each other again
this time inside a mans chest stopping a hemorrhage and debriding
the wound

DUKE
Now thats what I call real pretty We can
close up here and go into his belly

HAWKEYE
He cant take much more time on the table

DUKE
So we got to cut him fast I figure from the
X-ray it aint just the spleen We also got
to snatch his right kidney

EXT MASH COMPOUND — MORNING

Wearing fatigues now Hawkeye and Duke are making their weary way
from the hospital to their tent after a nights work There is an
announcement coming over the post-wide public address system but it
doesnt concern them

SARGEANT VOLLMERS VOICE
(over PA)
Captain Murrhardt please report to the
Colonels office at the earliest opportunity
Captain Murrhardt

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT THE SWAMP — MORNING

Ho-Jon throws a match into the oil stove but it doesnt work He
looks into it strikes another match and this time it lights up so
quickly he is almost singed by the flame Hawkeye and Duke open the
door and come in Ho-Jon straightens and bows
HO-JON
Good morning Captain Pierce and Captain
Forrest

HAWKEYE
You can cut the bow

HO-JON
I have not understood what you means

HAWKEYE
(demonstrating bow)
That Its out of the act

He and Duke remove their outer clothing during the ensuing

HO-JON
Because is not democrash All peoples created
equal

DUKE

Hey you been sneaking some reading outside
the frigging Bible

HO-JON
I have great interest for America his
peoples and his custom

DUKE
Good because we got a fine old American
custom we want to teach you You know what
these are

He gives Ho-Jon two bottles The boy looks at the labels

HO-JON
Gin I know yes
(reads other label)
Dry
(has trouble with the
word)
« vermouth

EXT MASH COMPOUND — MORNING

Frank walks toward the tent from the direction of the hospital

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT THE SWAMP — MORNING

Frank opens the door and is taken aback by the sight of the two
bottles on the table and Ho-Jon filling glasses held by Duke and
Hawkeye who have climbed into their sleeping bags He is so
disturbed he fails to shut the door

FRANK
Is that liquor
HAWKEYE
Finest kind Were training Ho-Jon to be a
bartender Join us

DUKE
But first will you please kindly shut the
goddam door

FRANK
I dont drink intoxicants

HAWKEYE
(to Duke)
Christ Almighty I think he means it

DUKE

FRANK
I dont believe its right for you to involve
a boy whos not seventeen years old yet

DUKE
The door Frank the door Where you from
anyhow Alaska

FRANK
(closing door)

DUKE
Same general idea

Frank proceeds to take off his outer clothing preparatory to
retiring

HO-JON
Officer all sleep now yes And I go wash
clothes

HAWKEYE

Right Ho-Jon See you later

FRANK
So long Ho-Jon

DUKE
You make a mean martini kid

Ho-Jon goes out Duke and Hawkeye settle back to enjoy their drinks
but they both come bolt upright when they see Frank drop to his
knees by his cot and begin to intone the Lords Prayer

FRANK
Our Father who art in Heaven Hallowd be Thy
name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done On
earth as it is in Heaven

Hawkeye and Duke find it hard to believe their eyes and ears They
never expected to see a grown man behaving as Frank is now
FRANK
Give us this day our daily

HAWKEYE
You ever caught this bread and forgive our
syndrome before Duke

FRANK
trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against

DUKE
Us Lead us not into

FRANK
No cases over the age of temptation but
deliver us eight from evil For Thine is the
kingdom the power and

HAWKEYE and DUKE
the glory forever Amen
(raising martini glasses)
Amen

DUKE
(singing)
Onward Christian soldiers

DUKE and HAWKEYE
(singing)
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus going on before
Christ our Royal Master leads against the
foe
Forward into battle

DUKE
(breaking off singing
points to Frank)
He aint finished

For a moment before Hawkeye speaks some of the words Frank is
mumbling come through

FRANK
And for our young men on the field of
battle that they may return home to their
dear ones

HAWKEYE
Come clean with us Frank Were you on this
religious kick back home or did you start to
crack up here on the post

FRANK
(ignoring him)
And for our Supreme Commander over here
and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington
DUKE
How long does the show go on Frank

Frank turns his head toward Duke while remaining in praying
position

FRANK
It gets longer all the time Now I have your
soul to pray for and Captain Pierces

HENRY
You dont aim to cause any trouble — But

DUKE

Or do you have some more extragavant gesture
of cooperation

DUKE
No Hawkeye just said it all

HAWKEYE
Except we forgot one other small thing

DUKE
Whats that

HAWKEYE
The chest-cutter

DUKE
Yeah thats right
(to Henry)
You better get us a chest-cutter before

HAWKEYE
This outfit needs somebody who can find his
way around the pulmonary anatomy when the
bases are loaded

DUKE
And its the ninth inning

HENRY
Forget it No Mash unit has a chest surgeon
and we arent about to get one Your housing
problem Ill give some thought to in the next
couple of weeks

Radar OReilly comes in with Emergency written all over his
expressive face He makes a hand gesture to Henry that could loosely
be construed as a salute

HENRY
Yes OReilly

DUKE
How you Radar
RADAR
Theyre running behind in the OR sir and
the Preop Ward is all jammed up Two choppers
and three ambulances full

This is the most serious kind of crisis for the outfit and Henrys
expression shows it

HENRY
(to Duke and Hawkeye)
You boys1l have to go to work early

DUKE
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve-hour
day The union aint gonna like it

HAWKEYE
You work those kind of hours you got to have

jabbering away on a direct line to heaven

HENRY
(crisply)
Major Burns will be out of your tent in
twenty-four hours
(to Radar)
Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest

Radar goes out Duke gets to his feet and Hawkeye makes a
preliminary move toward doing so

HAWKEYE
About that chest-cutter

than that

Hawkeye opens the door of the Officers Club looks in

HAWKEYE

He steps aside to let her precede him in There is nothing inside
except a pool table She hesitates He takes her in his arms again
this time pressing his hands against the seat of her fatigue pants

LIEUTENANT DISH

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

EXT THE SWAMP — DUSK

The wooden front of the tent has a new sign identifying it as THE
SWAMP

INT THE SWAMP — DUSK

First we see Hawkeye sitting on his cot looking across the tent at
the newcomer Attached to the canvas wall behind him is a photograph
of his wife and two sons aged four and two Next we turn our
attention to Duke on the adjoining cot (formerly Franks) He also
has a family picture on display his wife two-year-old daughter and
an infant Then we get our first glimpse of TRAPPER JOHN their new
tentmate about 30 tall and very thin his head pretty well hidden
inside the hood of a parka He is using cellophane tape to install
one of the popular nude photos of the day (such as the one of
Marilyn Monroe that circulated so widely in the early 1950s)
Completing the group is Ho-Jon who sits on the floor silently
taking in everything that is done or said

Finished with his decorating effort Trapper reaches into the depths
of his parka to produce a can of beer He digs into the other side
finds an opener and opens the beer Then his head goes back inside
the parka along with the can as he takes a swig from it

DUKE

(to Hawkeye)
Now I got you for a witness Im going to try
again So far all I dragged out of him is
hes from Bahston and hes only been in the
Army two months

(to Trapper)
Where were you when they drafted you

TRAPPER

DUKE
I mean what were you doing Were you a
resident or on a staff someplace

TRAPPER
Thats right

DUKE

Is there any reason why we shouldnt know the
name of it

TRAPPER
No
(a long swig of beer)
Or why you should

HAWKEYE
(to Duke)
I think Ive seen this nut somewhere
(to Trapper)
Havent I

TRAPPER
If you dont know what youve seen why
should I

Hawkeye is unsatisfied He keeps staring at Trapper sure hes seen
him before
DUKE
(to Trapper)
You ready to switch to a little tonic we
generally take us about this time Ho-Jon

Ho-Jon goes to the table and takes a few ice cubes from a hospital
ice-bag puts them into the pitcher along with gin and a dash of
vermouth

TRAPPER
Dont you use olives

DUKE
Where you think you are boy They probably
never seen a olive in this country

Ho-Jon pours three water-glasses full of martini and starts to
distribute them

HAWKEYE
(to Trapper)
Thats the front up the road a few miles We
have to get by without some of the comforts
of home

TRAPPER
I like an olive

He reaches into his parka comes up with a bottle of olives takes
one out and puts it into the martini Ho-Jon serves him Then as
Hawkeye and Duke gape at him he offers them the bottle

TIME LAPSE

INT OPERATING ROOM — DAY

There are two operations going on one of them being a simple
procedure requiring one surgeon and one nurse The other by contrast
is a very special event Trapper is operating assisted by another
surgeon a couple of nurses a corpsman and the anesthesiologist
UGLY JOHN BLACK Beside these actual participants almost all the
nurses and doctors from both shifts including Duke Hawkeye (with
Lieutenant Dish) Frank and Henry are in a circle around the
operating table as spectators

Trappers job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery or some
other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and involving a
large chest incision We see enough of the process to observe that
it is gory and deep inside a critical area but necessarily it is
the reactions of the people watching especially Duke and Hawkeye
that tell us how tricky an operation it is and how expertly Trapper
is handling it

The sequence is silent except for incidental operating room noises
Even Trappers occasional terse instructions to his assistants and
his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low for us to hear
There are four stages to the action
1 The beginning of the operation before an attentive audience
drawn by their interest in the new man and by the fact that this is
a surgical procedure they have never dared to attempt

2 Limited approval and professional respect for the assurance with
which Trapper plots his incision and starts working his way to his
destination

3 Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached The suspense
reaches its crest during the few moments when Trapper is doing the
actual mending job to which all the preliminaries have led The
faces of his colleagues express anxiety and hope that he can
accomplish what he set out to do and accomplish it quickly enough
to permit the patient to survive Henry not certain of his own
judgement looks to Duke for confirmation and Duke nods to indicate
he thinks Trapper has the situation under control

4 The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his
satisfaction and begins along with his assistant surgeon to close
up Henrys smile of relief is unsure and only tentative until he
catches Hawkeyes signal that the job has been done to perfection

TIME LAPSE

EXT MASH COMPOUND — DAY

Trapper Hawkeye and Duke emerge from the hospital in fatigues Some
enlisted men are tossing a football around One of them makes a wild
throw and the ball rolls to a stop at Trappers feet He stops to
look at it and the other two halt with him Then very slowly
Trapper leans over and picks up the ball waving Hawkeye downfield

Hawkeye complies unquestioningly and when he is about thirty yards
away Trapper whips a perfect pass into his arms Hawkeye just
stands where he is holding the ball oblivious of the enlisted men
who want it back as Trapper and Duke continue toward him
Revelation jolts him with apocalyptic force

HAWKEYE
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around Duke
did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by
intercepting a pass

DUKE
Sixteen times

HAWKEYE
We didnt have a chance little Androscoggin
College against the Big Green but there was
this blizzard and we held then nothing-
nothing till the last twenty seconds Then
this great passer of theirs let one go snow
and all

TRAPPER
Lucky you didnt have your mouth open or it
would have gone down your throat
HAWKEYE

Hes Trapper John Only man in history who
ever found fulfillment in the ladies can of
a Boston and Maine Railroad car When the
Conductor caught him in there with his Winter
Carnival date she screamed He trapped me
What have you been doing since those days
Trapper

DUKE
What does he have to do A score like that a
man could just live on his reputation

The enlisted men increasingly concerned about their football are
muttering mutinously to each other Hawkeye is too carried away
about Trappers identity to notice this till Trapper calls it to his
attention

TRAPPER
(to Hawkeye)
Ball

Hawkeye looks at the football and at the enlisted men and finally
getting the point throws it back to them

TRAPPER
(relieved to find another
subject)
What gives over there

They look across the compound to the Shower Tent behind which an
Army truck full of GIs has just pulled up While Hawkeye and Duke
explain whats going on to Trapper and the three of them move in
for a closer look we see the visiting GIs drop one by one from the
rear of the truck pay their admission fees and take their places in
the line leading up to the strategically placed peep hole in the
rear corner of the tent

DUKE
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent

HAWKEYE
(to Trapper)
You met him Walt Waldowski the Dental
Officer

DUKE
Nice guy for an enamel surgeon

TRAPPER
What are they peeking at Captain Waldowski
in the shower

HAWKEYE
Part of him Painless is the owner and
operator of the Pride of Hamtrack Thats
where he comes from Hamtrack Michigan
DUKE
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam
Army Care to have a look a man with your
background

HAWKEYE
Way we hear it the Pride is supposed to have
run up the highest lifetime batting average
ever recorded in Wayne County

speech is that of the rural southern black

JUDSON

TIME LAPSE

INT OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

Hawkeye and Duke are working on a patient about whose chances their
faces reveal extreme pessimism The nurse in attendance is Leslie
Hawkeye takes the patients blood pressure and frowns at the
reading

HAWKEYE
This kid looks like a loser Maybe we better
get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix

DUKE
(to Leslie)
Call Dago Red

TIME LAPSE

INT OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

Without interfering with the administration of blood and other
medical measures Dago Red is just finishing giving last rites to
the patient

present and future life open to thee the
gates of heaven and bring thee to
everlasting life
(makes the sign of the

Cross)
May Almighty God bless thee Father Son and
Holy Ghost

She wants him to feel it and he does reacting excitedly

DUKE
Slowing down

Hawkeye meanwhile is checking blood pressure again

HAWKEYE
Going up Nice work Red

TIME LAPSE

INT THE SWAMP — DAY

Dago Red is the cocktail guest of the three Swampmen Ho-Jon sits in
his usual place on the floor following everything thats said and
refilling martini glasses wherever needed

DAGO RED
Theres sort of a built-in prayer for the
sick man to get well but of course thats
not the basic intention

HAWKEYE
I dont care about the intention I just know
your Cross Action is a plus on our side Ive
seen it come through four times

DUKE
And youve had a natural four times in a row
in a crap game Right Does that mean

HAWKEYE
Not without lots of praying and kissing the
dice
(to Dago Red)
Its a different ritual but it works the
same

DUKE
What do you think Trapper

TRAPPER
Me I was raised a mackerel-snapper

Dago Red gives him a quick inent look which Hawkeye notes

TRAPPER
But I turned in my knee pads

HAWKEYE
Ho-Jon give the Father some more martini

DAGO RED
Just a taste Ho-Jon
(to the group)
Id better get to the point what I came
here for today
DUKE
You came because we asked you for a drink

HAWKEYE
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us
with your fixes

DAGO RED
Well sure but Im also worried about Walt
Waldowski — Painless His poker players got
in an argument and asked him for a ruling
and he said what difference did it make it
was just a card game

Its obvious from the shocked reactions of the Swampmen that the
priest couldnt have reported a more ominous symptom

HAWKEYE
I guess Im getting a tootheache I better
have looked at

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT DENTAL CLINIC — DAY

There is no activity around the dental chair but the nonstop poker
game is thriving as Hawkeye enters carrying a bottle in a paper
bag The players are evenly divided between officers (UGLY JOHN
MURRHARDT and a visiting HELICOPTER PILOT) and enlisted men
(VOLLMER RADAR and JUDSON)

UGLY JOHN
Take a seat Hawk We can use a fresh pigeon

HAWKEYE
Got to see the man about a tooth Where is
he

RADAR

(to Vollmer )
Call With a pair of kings
(to Hawkeye pointing to
smaller tent attached)

BRIEF TIME LAPSE
INT PAINLESS TENT — DAY

Painless is lying on his back on the cot staring blankly at the
ceiling Hawkeye has poured drinks from his bottle and is sipping
his but Painless remains untouched

PAINLESS
If a man isnt a man anymore whats he got
left to live for

HAWKEYE
Tell me the whole story Walt

PAINLESS
Theres this native braod works in the
laundry I dont know if youve noticed

HAWKEYE
Theres only one worth noticing

PAINLESS
You noticed I wasnt going to fool around
over here Ive got these three girls Im
engaged to back home

He indicates three photographs of young women displayed with equal
prominence Any one of them could make Miss America

PAINLESS
But I had this feeling I ought to make the
effort To test myself And I flunked

HAWKEYE
What did you have to test for Gods sake
the dental Don Juan of Detroit

PAINLESS
Don Juanism is just a cover Ive been
reading up on it
(emotionally overcome
turning away)
Im a fake Im a fraud Ive been living a
lie

Moved by the intensity of his self-denunciation Hawkeye bends down
close to Painless puts a comforting hand on his shoulder

HAWKEYE
Painless you mustnt talk that way Its a
lot of crap Cover for what

PAINLESS
Homosexuality

Hawkeye straightens abruptly his hand rising from Painless’
shoulder as from a hot stove
PAINLESS
Now I know thats been my problem since I was
a kid But it only caught up to me last
night

HAWKEYE
Youve been drawn to other males Since you
were a kid

PAINLESS
No never in the slightest

HAWKEYE
Just in dreams

PAINLESS
Or in dreams either I repressed it
completely Classic pattern of inhibition

HAWKEYE
Thats what youve been doing all these years
with every dame you could lay your hands on
Repressing your real self

PAINLESS
But its all over now and I cant face it
Imagine if you found out you were one you
wouldnt like breaking the news to your wife
Well I got the same problem multiplied

HAWKEYE
You dont have any problem Youve got thirty
good years ahead of you easy Maybe youll
have to cut down as you grow older get along
with just two fiancees but

PAINLESS
No one thing I finally know for sure I1l
never function with a woman again

TIME LAPSE

INT THE SWAMP — NIGHT

Hawkeye is reporting to Duke and Trapper Murrhardt and Bandini are
there as well as Ho-Jon

HAWKEYE
There ought to be a law against dentists
reading Matter of fact I thought there was
Anyway this is an obsession He cant be
persuaded out of it

HO-JON
(appearing in doorway)
Hes comin this-a-way The jaw-breaker

DUKE
Yall just act natural
HAWKEYE
Get out the scotch Ho-Jon
(to the others)
Dont mention the sex thing unless he brings
it up

A perfunctory knock on the door is immediately followed by the
entrance of Painless

DUKE
How you Walt We was just fixing to have a
nightcap

TRAPPER

(to Ho-Jon)
Pour one for Painless

Ho-Jon serves drinks all around There is a silence as each of the
hosts tries to think of a conversational opening

PAINLESS
I thought you guys ought to know Im going
to commit suicide

This leads to another silence broken by Trapper who doesnt go so
far as to stand up but leans way out from his sack to grasp the
dentist by the hand

TRAPPER
Miss you Walt

DUKE
He said it for us all Walt

BANDIDI
How about leaving me your record player

HAWKEYE
How do you figure to go Forty-five between
the eyes

DUKE
Powerful sloppy

MURRHARDT

consultation)
Well Im sure my colleagues will agree there

extinguishing the vital forces

TRAPPER

The priest is sitting at his desk reading his breviary when Hawkeye
and Trapper enter Trapper goes over to Reds beer supply opens it
and distributes three cans while Hawkeye greets their host

HAWKEYE
How they goin Losing Preacher What do you
hear from the Pope

DAGO RED
You talked to Walt

HAWKEYE
Hes parted his moorings

TRAPPER
Were throwing him a Last Supper We came to
invite you

HAWKEYE
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great
Divide tonight and we need your help to
straighten him out

DAGO RED
What do you want me to do

HAWKEYE
Put in one of your fixes Walt knows hes
loused himself with the Church but its part
of our plan to make him think he has the keys
to the kingdom Which he will think if you
grease the skids for him
DAGO RED
I dont think I can give absolution to a man
whos about to commit suicide Its a mortal
sin

HAWKEYE
What is Red the intention or the act

DAGO RED
(confused)
I believe it takes both Id have to look it
up
HAWKEYE

Just use common sense Your job is preventing
sin and the way to do that is give him your
best Cross Action

TRAPPER
Or you can let him knock himself out You
personallyd be sending him to his grave

HAWKEYE
An eternal damnation

DAGO RED
(feeling cornered)
I dont know Im not sure what the Military
Vicars office would think

TRAPPER
They sure as hell wont hear about it from
us

TIME LAPSE

INT DENTAL CLINIC — NIGHT

The poker table and dental chair have been removed to make room for
two long tables from the Mess Hall At these a sumptuous candle-
lit stag banquet is coming to an end The guests are doctors
administrative officers chopper pilots and enlisted men Duke is on
his feet raising a glass of champagne in a toast (All our male
cast except Henry and Frank)

DUKE
Yall come here to say a final goodbye to our
old friend Walt But maybe it aint so final
Maybe hes just going on ahead into the
Unknown to do a little recon job for us all

During this tribute the guests rise their eyes on the guest of
honor who sits with his food untouched a vacant expression on his
face When Duke has finished and everyone has drunk the toast they
applaud and sit down again Trapper raps for attention and indicates
Hawkeye who rises
HAWKEYE
I just got this one thing to say Nobody
ordered Walt to take on this mission He
volunteered for certain death Thats what
we award our highest medal for Thats what
being a soldier is all about

Except for Painless himself the gathering is deeply moved by this
thought some of them to the point of tears Again Trapper restores
order

TRAPPER
Only one man here can add anything to that

He looks to Dago Red who stands up dressed for the first time in
the priestly vestments he wears for Sunday Mass He walks to where
Painless sits and there begins the viaticum (holy communion for
those in danger of death)

DAGO RED
Receive my brother this food for your
journey

A coffin borne into the room by two enlisted men while Red is still
speaking is lined with blankets equipped with a pillow for
comfortable reclining prior to the onset of death and furnished
with momentos of Painless earthly career two fresh decks of cards
a box of poker chips a fifth of scotch some basic dental
instruments and the photographs of his three fiancees It is set
down on the floor next to Painless who regards it with the first
show of interest he has manifested during the proceedings

DAGO RED
(bestowing the sacred
host)
The body of our Lord Jesus Christ that
He may guard you from the wicked enemy and
lead you into everlasting life Amen

Red is making the sign of the Cross when Painless curiousity
asserts itself

PAINLESS
What the hells that

TRAPPER
Coffin Yours

PAINLESS
Im not even dead yet

HAWKEYE
Youre a pretty heavy guy to lug around Be a
hell of a lot more convenient for everybody
if you got into the box as soon as youve
taken the capsule

He produces and opens a small box inside which surrounded by pure
white cotton a black capsule is displayed like a rare jewel Dago
Red meanwhile preferring not to know what happens from here on
makes his way out

PAINLESS
(scrutinizing the capsule)
How do you take it

DUKE
(appearing at his side
with tumbler of whiskey)
With whiskey A good swallow first and a big
one afterwards Speeds it into the
bloodstream

Painless takes the tumbler from him with one hand the capsule with
the other He downs a good-sized swig of whiskey then with the
capsule in front of his face hesitates

PAINLESS
You guys sure thisll do the job

DUKE
We wouldnt give you nothing but the best

TRAPPER
We stand behind all our work

HAWKEYE
You want it straight Medical history records
no instance of anyone taking this particular
prescription and surviving

PAINLESS
Here goes nothing

He pops the capsule into his mouth and washes it down with a large
drink of whiskey Hawkeye gestures to the waiting coffin Painless
gets up and lowers himself into it

PAINLESS
How much time do I have

HAWKEYE
Just about enough to say goodbye to
everybody
(announcing)

Line up over here men if you want to pay
your last respects Keep moving and file on
out when youre through

PAINLESS
I wonder if Reds fix swings it for me
whats heaven really like

TRAPPER
Its a bedroom where a man is always at his
peak and doesnt have to take any time outs
HAWKEYE
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant
Dish

The Last Supper guests are filing by the coffin bending low to
shake Painless hand and murmur words of farewell

DUKE
Drink up Walt One for the glory road

He holds the glass to Painless lips helps him down the rest of the
whiskey

INT POSTOP WARD — NIGHT

Hawkeye finishes checking a patient looks to doorway and sees
lieutenant Dish standing there He crosses to join her

HAWKEYE
Thanks for coming Maria
(takes her arm and leads
her through exit)
Sorry it had to be so late

EXT MASH COMPOUND — NIGHT
Hawkeye and Lieutenant Dish walk from the Postop Ward

LIEUTENANT DISH
I couldnt have slept tonight anyhow

HAWKEYE
Youre leaving tomorrow

LIEUTENANT DISH
In less than twelve hours Ill be on my way

HAWKEYE
Thats when the real strain starts Three
weeks on a troopship
(embraces her)
Poor baby

LIEUTENANT DISH
(kissing him)
Dear sweet Hawkeye

HAWKEYE
Though I guess who itll really be rough on
is your husband

LIEUTENANT DISH
Youre on his side all of the sudden
HAWKEYE
A man would be more considerate He wouldnt
come home to his wife a nervous wreck

LIEUTENANT DISH
How would he avoid it as if I needed to
ask

HAWKEYE
It could be a purely impersonal thing What
matters is the therapeutic value of relieving
your tensions

LIEUTENANT DISH
You should have been a marriage counselor
(drawing his head closer
to hers)
But Ill show you whats wrong with your
theory

They kiss passionately Dish is shaken by it and that shows in her
voice when she continues making her point

LIEUTENANT DISH
Do you think anything between us could be
impersonal Or pure You better forget logic
because youre proving why I shouldnt go to
bed with you

HAWKEYE
(after a moment of massive
internal struggle)
I didnt mean with me

It takes a couple of seconds for what he has said to penetrate her
conciousness She looks at him incredulously

LIEUTENANT DISH
Youre asking for somebody else

HAWKEYE
It happens to be a matter of life and death

LIEUTENANT DISH
A man is going to die if he doesnt have my
fair young body

HAWKEYE
Precisely Maria Tonight you have the same
privilege that comes on rare occasions to the
chief executive of some state or nation
the privilege of restoring life by one
tender act of mercy to a doomed fellow
creature

While he is speaking a blue light goes on in a tent in the
background As they turn to see what is going on four men carrying
a heavy box approach the tent
EXT BLUE-LIT TENT — NIGHT (OFFICERS CLUB)

At closer range the box is revealed to be Painless coffin with the
departed dentist inside it The four men who carry it into the tent
are Radar Judson Boone and Seidman This tent doesnt have a
wooden door like the Swamp just a flap

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

EXT BLUE-LIT TENT — NIGHT

The four enlisted men carry the coffin empty out of the tent Then
Hawkeye and Dish appear moving slowly toward the tent as he
continues to break down her resistance

HAWKEYE
He should come to now for a while but hes
got so much dope in him by tomorrow he wont
know fact from fantasy

LIEUTENANT DISH
You think he wont

HAWKEYE
What do you care Youll be on your way to
Japan

LIEUTENANT DISH
Im fond of Painless and Id feel terrible
if anything happened to him

HAWKEYE
Its your decision Maria I dont want to
high-pressure you

LIEUTENANT DISH
Id be crazy to think my virtue such as it
is was more important than his life

HAWKEYE
In fact Id rather not try to influence you
at all
(opening tent flap)
Lets just go in and take a look and then
you think it through for yourself

INT BLUE-LIT TENT — NIGHT

The tent has been fixed up with all the resources at their disposal
— cushions parachute cloth mirrors and little touches of elegance
gathered from all over the post — to resemble a luxurious bedroom on
the home front Lying in bed (the pool table) between clean
inviting sheets is Painless The boys have undressed him as we can
see by his bare shoulders Hawkeye takes Dish by the hand and leads
her to the side of the bed
HAWKEYE
One last look at him
(raises sheet uncovering
Painless to the knees)
- Still alive
(slips raised sheet into
Dishs grasp)
the whole man

Dishs eyes pop at what she sees So astounded is she that she
doesnt notice Hawkeye has given her the sheet and made off

LIEUTENANT DISH
My God Hawkeye I never realized I never
even dreamed
(becoming aware hes no
longer at her side)
Hawkeye Hawk

She finds hes disappeared altogether She cant resist turning her
gaze back to the uncovered Painless Then she drops the sheet

EXT BLUE-LIT TENT — NIGHT

The tent flap drops into place continuing the movement of the
sheet Our attention is drawn up the front of the tent to its peak
which points firmly upwards

TIME LAPSE

EXT THE SWAMP — MORNING

There is the SOUND of a HELICOPTER overhead Hawkeye emerges from
the tent to look at it verifying that it is coming from the
peaceful south rather than the embattled north Then he sees
Lieutentant Dish coming out of her tent wearing her Army uniform
and followed by one of the enlisted men carrying her bags Hawkeye
waves goodbye but Dish doesnt see him Her face seen up close has
a serene faraway look neither happy nor unhappy but enriched by
experience

Hawkeye is not distressed by her failure to acknowledge him he
understands its a question of preoccupation and not a deliberate
snub He starts across the compound to the Mess Hall noting that
the helicopter is descending to land on the far side of the
hospital

EXT LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH — MORNING

There is a small welcoming party on hand headed by Henry himself
to greet the passenger arriving in the helicopter When it lands the
door is opened and HOT LIPS (as she will soon be known) gets out
smartly which is the way she does everything Her official name is
Major Margaret Houlihan and she is tallish willowish blondish
fortyish prettyish She and Henry exchange salutes and then shake
hands The others in the greeting party are out of the habit of
saluting and have to be reminded by a stern look from their
Commanding Officer

As Henry and Hot Lips followed by the others head for the hospital
entrance Lieutenant Dish appears with the enlisted man behind her
She gets into the helicopter and he lifts her bags in after her A
moment later the chopper is airborne again

INT MESS HALL — DAY

One of the first people Hawkeye sees in the officers section is
Painless who is eating an enormous breakfast with great gusto

HAWKEYE
Morning Painless How they goin

PAINLESS
Big day Two jaws to rebuild

INT POSTOP WARD — DAY

Frank is listening gravely to a wounded soldiers heartbeat through
a stethoscope Standing by awaiting orders is Private Boone Frank
has a disturbed reaction to the lack of vital signs from the
patient

FRANK
(to Boone)
Get me one cc of adrenalin and a cardiac
needle
BOONE

Whats a

FRANK
Never mind questions Get them

As Boone dashes off with no comprehension of the errand he is
supposed to perform Trapper a couple of beds away in the soiled
fatigues he wears on nonoperating room duty can see and hear what
is going on While he watches Frank checks the patient further and
establishes that he is dead With a disappointed sigh he drops the
mans lifeless arm and throws the bedcovers back over him up to his
neck

INT OPERATING ROOM — DAY

Henry is showing Hot Lips through the hospital and introducing her
to personnel At the moment he is presenting Knocko

HENRY
Captain Williams Major
(to Knocko)
Major Houlihan is our new Chief Nurse

Knocko holds out her hand in friendly greeting and is startled to
find Hot Lips expects a salute instead
INT POSTOP WARD — DAY

Trapper having observed Franks recognition of the fact his patient
is dead is unprepared for what the Major does when Boone comes
running back with a syringe a small vial and an ordinary hypodermic
needle

BOONE
(anxiously)
This what you wanted Major

FRANK
(looking at vial)
No you idiot I said adrenalin And a
cardiac needle

He turns back to the patient and goes all over again through the
same checking process he followed before

BOONE
(desperately)
Ill ask a nurse

FRANK
Its too late You killed him Boone

A ghastly look appears on Boones face He tries to say something
cant get it out and bursts into tears instead Then additionally
ashamed of himself for this weakness he runs out Frank deciding
not to discipline the boy for the display of unsoldierly conduct is
proceeding about his business when Trapper accosts him

TRAPPER
You got a moment Frank

He indicates the Utility Room which leads off the Operating Room
and the Postop Ward When Frank assents Trapper opens the door and
ushers him in

INT UTILITY ROOM — DAY

Its a small room containing among other items a table with a pot
of coffee and cups which are available to medical personnel at all
hours

TRAPPER
You all through work for the day

FRANK
Yes I am Why do you want to know

TRAPPER
Make sure you got time to sleep this off

He puts his whole hundred and thirty pounds behind a right uppercut
that lands squarely on Franks jaw At the same instant the door
from the Operating Room opens and Henry gallantly makes way for Hot
Lips to precede him
HENRY
This is the

Frank drops to the floor momentarily knocked out

HENRY
T-Trapper C-C-Captain McIntyre what
the hell

HOT LIPS
(staring at Trapper
incredulously)
Thats a captain

Frank is coming to and could probably get back into the fight by a
count of eight if he had any desire to

HENRY
(to Trapper)
Whats going on Who started this

TRAPPER
You mean who hit who

HENRY
Yes thats what I mean

TRAPPER
I did First and only blow So far

FRANK
(getting up)
He wouldnt have touched me if Id had my
guard up Let us settle this between
ourselves Colonel Alone

HENRY
What do you think Im running an English
boarding school McIntyre youre under
arrest Confine yourself to quarters pending
an investigation

TRAPPER

Henry is standing indignantly over Trapper who is sipping a beer in
his sleeping bag Duke Hawkeye and Ho-Jon are witnesses to the
encounter

HENRY

Whats wrong with you

TRAPPER
I dont know I must have lost my punch I
didnt think the son-of-a-bitch would get up

HAWKEYE
Stop acting like a colonel Henry You know
Trapper wouldnt sock him without a good
reason

HENRY
Theres no reason good enough for one medical
officer to strike another

DUKE
That there Frank Burns is a menace Whenever
a patient croaks on him its either Gods
will or somebody elses fault

HAWKEYE
This time he did it to a kid whos simple
enough to believe him Why dont you dump the
mother Henry He creates more work than he
gets done

HENRY
I should fire him because he got in the way
of Trappers fist No Ive put up with a lot
from you guys but now I finally have to take
disciplinary action

HAWKEYE
Christ All of a sudden its West Point

DUKE
What are you going to do with him

HENRY
Well
(to Trapper)
I was going to name you Chief Surgeon
(to Hawkeye)
To consult on both shifts yours and Franks

DUKE
Hey thats great Henry Good thinking

Honey nobody as pretty as you could ever
impose please sit down Coffee

He offers her some from the pot beside him and she holds out a cup
while he pours it

HOT LIPS
Captain Ive been observing the nurses on
your shift But naturally your own opinion is
more informed than mine

HAWKEYE
Im glad you feel that way Major because
you see its a team effort doctors
nurses enlisted men and I feel
responsible for my whole team and I want you
to know Im satisfied with them

HOT LIPS
All of them

HAWKEYE
Thats right We work well together

HOT LIPS
Major Burns is far from satisfied

HAWKEYE
That dont surprise me If youre a good
observer you must have observed by now that
Frank Burns is a jerk

HOT LIPS
On the contrary Ive observed hes not only
a good technical surgeon hes a good
military surgeon And that includes how a man
dresses and how he bears himself and his
sense of what it means to be an officer in
the United States Army
HAWKEYE
And his track record that dont count Look
honey when you watch the two shifts try to
notice which one does the most work with the
least fuss

HOT LIPS
Ive noticed that both nurses and enlisted
men address you as ‘Hawkeye’

HAWKEYE
Its my name Maybe that sounds silly to you
but

HOT LIPS

That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with
maximum efficiency in a military
organization

HAWKEYE

Okay Major honey

(pushes back his chair)
Im going to have a couple shots scotch and
go to bed Id normally ask you to join me
but obviously youre a female version of the
routine Regular Army clown And that turns me
off so just leave my outfit alone and well
get along fine

(stands up to go)
See you around the campus

HOT LIPS
(icily)
I wonder how a degenerated person like you
could have reached a position of
responsibility in the Army Medical Corps

HAWKEYE
Sister if I knew the answer to that I sure
as hell wouldnt be here

People are going in and out of the Mess Hall when an announcement
comes over the public address system

VOLLMERS VOICE

Attention everybody I have an announcement
‘Effective today Thirteen April Captain

(informally on his own)
Nice going Trapper
Ugly John and Captain Bandini shake Trappers hand in
congratulations The only two officers in the outfit who dont like
the news come out of the Mess Hall together Major Burns and
Houlihan

HOT LIPS
Theres no point appealing to Colonel Blake
Theyve got him bewitched

No The only thing to do is write General
Hammond

she has her own tent)

envelope

HOT LIPS

HOT LIPS
We think the same way

FRANK
Its supper time

it)
But youre not hungry are you

HOT LIPS
Ravenous What about you

FRANK
(trying to hide his
disappointment )
Well sure if you are Margaret
HOT LIPS
Anyway we want to get this letter off

He grabs her and kisses her and from her reaction we get a clear
picture of the kind of female she is She responds to the kiss
fervently pressing her lips and body against his but the moment
she decides to end it she switches right back to her businesslike
manner

HOT LIPS
The sooner it reaches him the sooner we can
turn this into a tight military outfit

HO-JON

MURRHARDT
Bear is the same thing as carry

HO-JON

HAWKEYE
(afraid of where this is
leading)
Never mind Forget it

DUKE
(simultaneously)
A native is someone who is born in a
particular place

HO-JON
And if I go to New York the natives there
will carry me I dont think so

Its that disrespect for you thats what I
cant forgive them

FRANK
Oh Im used to it What makes me sore is how
they behave towards you
(pulling her into a tight
embrace)
They ought to be grateful to have you
(kisses her his hand
vanishing beneath her
skirt)
I certainly am

HOT LIPS
(undoing one of his
buttons and sliding her
hand under his blouse)
And Im grateful for you Frank especially
with those boors around Weve grown very
close in a short time

He kisses her around the neck and bosom removing such of the
clothing as gets in the way

FRANK
It isnt just chance Im sure of that God
meant us to find each other

Instead of lingering on a scene that threatens to become
pornographic our attention is drawn down beneath Hot Lips cot
where a strange object is being inserted under the canvas wall of
the tent It is a microphone

to an inflammatory move on
his part)

Frank is on top of Hot Lips and though the details of their amorous
activity are hidden under the covers we can see enough to know it
is reaching a climax

HOT LIPS

Each word she speaks is instantly echoed on the speaker system so
that the word charge is still sounding after she has finished
saying it She suddenly realizes there is something wrong though
she doesnt immediately figure out what it is

The word please is repeated so distinctly outside that while
Frank in his critical condition remains unaware of it Hot Lips sits
bolt upright pushing him aside

Duke and Trapper continue on their way to their table in the
officers section Frank reacts angrily and is about to go after
Duke when Hot Lips touches his shoulder and speaks in a low tone

HOT LIPS
No leave all the rowdiness to them Calm
down drink your coffee

Hawkeye probably cant make out her exact words but his gaze
follows her as she goes out the open door The he looks at Frank
bending low across the table as if he too had something
confidential to say but actually speaking quite distinctly

HAWKEYE
Tell me Frank is that stuff youre tapping
any good

Frank reacts with such rage he cant speak for a moment

He keeps a wary eye on Frank while talking and thus is able to duck
the coffee pot Frank hurls at him From where Henry stands in the
doorway this act of unprovoked aggression is astonishing enough
for he can see Hawkeye innocently eating his cereal but the Colonel
is even more amazed when Frank follows it by springing across the
table onto Hawkeye and raining blows on him Hawkeye puts up no
resistance but simply covers his head and screams

It was really nice of you to take me along

HAWKEYE
I didnt have much choice

LIEUTENANT SCORCH
You really say the cutest things

HAWKEYE
Yeah

INT KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER — DAY

The locale is established by the presence of military personnel in
uniform and the fact that a KOREAN ARMY DOCTOR with the aid of one
assistant is examining in quick succession a long line of naked
young Korean boys Ho-Jons turn comes up and we see how perfunctory
the process is a brief overall scrutiny for visible defects a
blood pressure reading and the application of a stethescope to a
few key spots Ho-Jon looks healthy and the doctor is startled by
the unexpected reaction he gets on applying the stethscope to the
boys heart He turns to check the blood pressure figure which his
assistant is about to record on the form he has taken from Ho-Jon
Apparently the pressure is just as out-of-line as the heartbeat and
the doctor feels Ho-Jon is ineligible for military service

KOREAN DOCTOR

(to assistant in Korean)
We cant take this one His heartbeat is much
too fast and his blood pressure is
dangerously high

(to Ho-Jon)
Have you ever seen a doctor before

(abruptly to assistant)
Wait a minute What does it say there about
where hes been working

(takes Ho-Jons form and

reads the information for

himself then to

assistant)
Get the check on his urine sample right away

Youll have to wait around for a while young
man I need some more information before I
talk to you again

being addressed by a stranger whom he recognizes as the doctor that
examined Ho-Jon Ho-Jon is with him

KOREAN DOCTOR

(in English)
You please excuse

(as Hawkeye turns and sees

them)
I have been making examination of this young
man to find if he will be soldier in our
army

HAWKEYE
Yes I know Hi Ho-Jon How did it go

KOREAN DOCTOR
I dont liking it at all what I hear when I
listen to the heart And such a blood
pressure for so young a boys Is frightening

HAWKEYE
Im sorry to hear that You think hes unfit
for military service
KOREAN DOCTOR
At first is no doubt But then I am seeing on
his paper he work in American hospital And I
think there are so many drugs in such a
places he could take some by mistake

HAWKEYE
Why would he do that

KOREAN DOCTOR
Who is knowing But the drug I have find in
his urine is solving all mysteries By
tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high
blood pressure So I think maybe you will
like to tell him goodbye Okay

He gives Hawkeye a warm smile and leaves the two of them alone Its
clear from Hawkeyes expression that he has no choice but to admit
defeat

sharp But Im still going to start the ball
rolling for you to go to college in America

EXT OFFICERS LATRINE — DAY

Its a warm spring day in a climate much like the northeastern part
of the United States At first we see nothing but the latrine tent
which is identified by a sign A couple of small missiles propelled
with considerable force strike the canvas but it is only when they
roll back to the ground that we can identify them as golf balls A
closer look at the ground area reveals a dozen other balls scattered
around and then we see two Korean Houseboys appear from protected
places on the sides of the tent looking carefully to make sure
there are no more balls coming and proceed to gather up those on
the ground During this action there is the SOUND of a helicopter
landing near the hospital

EXT FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS LATRINE — DAY

The disrepubility in clothes and grooming that has been increasing
with each view of the Swampmen has reached an extreme stage in the
view we now get of Hawkeye and Trapper ALong with their soiled
fatigue pants Hawkeye wears a torn dirty T-shirt of some unlikely
color Trapper a sport shirt that looks as if he had picked it up in
Hawaii on the way over and worn it ever since Both are unshaven
Each has a well-equipped golf bag into which he now replaces the
iron club he has been using for the medium-range shots they have
been practicing Taking out drivers they set tees in the ground
and as the houseboys run up with the balls Trapper indicates they
will be shooting down the longest dimension of the field After
addressing the balls with a few practice swings they deliver expert
drives that are not only in the 250-yard range but fairly straight
in the intended direction

HAWKEYE
(pleased with himself)
I came within about ten yards of you You
know something Trapper the way we been
going if we ever got to see a real golf
course again I bet we could burn it up

TRAPPER
As far as the greens maybe I dont know if
my putting would come back or not without
some practice

The SOUND of the helicopter taking off again doesnt concern them
till they realize it is headed directly toward them It comes down
so close to them they step back to avoid the wind from the propeller
blades which the PILOT keeps going as he and Vollmer climb out

VOLLMER
(to pilot)
Thats him on the right

PILOT
Thats Captain McIntyre

VOLLMER
(to Trapper)
The Lieutenants flown up from Seoul just to
find you

PILOT
Youre Captain McIntyre

TRAPPER
Thats what the Army calls me Stick out your
tongue take off your shirt and tell me where
it hurts you

His face showing his bewilderment the Pilot silently hands Trapper
a long white envelope and a large brown one Trapper tears open the
white one glances at the top copy of the order it contains

TRAPPER
Proceed immediately to Kokura Japan
(to Pilot)
Do you know what this is about

PILOT
Theres a GI there whose fathers a
Congressman A grenade went off in training
and they think theres a piece of it in his
heart

Yes sir Apparently some big chest surgeon
in Boston told the Congressman the only man
to take care of his son was Captain John
McIntyre

(his doubt undiminished)

I suppose there could be more than one doctor
with that name

meanwhile has held the X-rays up to the sunlight and invited
to look at them at the same time

to Hawkeye)

routine she doesnt even look up from her magazine when Hawkeye puts
a question to her

HAWKEYE

But then she does glimpse enough of their costumes to take a full
look and her reaction indicates clearly that she is not prepared
for unkempt unmilitary-looking men carrying golf bags

Hold it If this soldier enforces her own
orders Im ready to take her on Anxious
Single combat

He moves toward the girl who holds her ground staunchly till they
are almost in contact Then she takes a step back and continues to
take one step backwards for each one of his in her direction When
they get close to the door her resistance collapses entirely and
she scurries back to her seat at the desk where she grabs the phone
as Trapper and Hawkeye march through the door

to crack that kids chest and get out to the
golf course before its dark So find the

in Hawkeyes direction and then by picking up his anesthesia chart
and writing in the space labeled First Assistant the name

Trapper and Hawkeye enter the door closing behind them and look
around It is a long time since they have seen surroundings like
these with Western upholstered furniture pictures on the walls
and high quality wall-to-wall carpeting It is this last feature
that attracts Hawkeyes attention He squats down to feel its
texture and with a look invites Trapper to do the same Trapper is
also impressed with the smoothness of the surface and without
having to exchange a word about it they each find a putter and a
golf ball and start lining up targets for their brief sorely
missed putting practice

Trapper has also taken his golf bag and the two of them walk out
serenely together The Colonel supports himself on his desk as he
makes his way to his chair and sits down to absorb the shock to
his system

Hawkeye has discovered a pair of knee-length argyle socks which
he exhibits to Trapper

HAWKEYE

very young not more than seventeen dressed in slacks They see
Trapper and Hawkeyes golf bags and start to sling them over their
shoulders

Trapper and Hawkeye dressed in kimonos are sitting Japanese style
on the floor with Me Lay around a low table Three girls serve them
attentively doing everything for them except actually feeding them
A girl named MICHIKO takes away a plate that Trapper has left
virtually untouched and puts a bowl of thick soup in front of him
The second girl serves soup to Hawkeye and Me Lay and the third
brings in a large bowl of rice

TRAPPER
Soup Rice What are we doing beginning all
over again
ME LAY
No we had a clear soup to start This is a
thick one and you ought to taste it Theres
nothing like it back home

TRAPPER
How can I taste it now Weve already had
like twelve courses

MICHIKO
You are not wishing to eat more I bring you
most special plum brandy

TRAPPER
I dont want it I dont want to eat I dont
want to drink
(reaches out and grabs
Michikos ankle)
All I want

There is a KNOCK on the door followed immediately by the entrance
of a Japanese nurse who indicates an urgent desire to speak to Me
Lay Me Lay gets up and listens to what she tells him in an
undertone Trapper meanwhile has succeeded in pulling Michiko off
her feet and makes clear the general direction of his intentions by
sprawling out on the floor with her in his embrace

ME LAY
(to Hawkeye and Trapper)
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid
for me

TRAPPER
Now

HAWKEYE
(to Me Lay)
Why cant you look at him

ME LAY
I have but well you know Ive been mainly
an anesthetist a long time now and well

Id like you guys to take a look at him

HAWKEYE
Whats the story

ME LAY
Well one of the girls got careless and two
days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound
American-Japanese male

HAWKEYE
Whats wrong with him

ME LAY
Every time we feed him it either comes right
back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a
hell of a time
TRAPPER
(releasing Michiko and
sitting up reluctantly)
We dont have to see him Call that half-
assed Army hospital and tell them to be ready
to put some lipiodol in this kids esophagus
and take X-rays

ME LAY
But its ten-thirty at night We cant get
military personnel out for a civilian A
foreign civilian

HAWKEYE
Dont give them any unnecessary details Just
say the pros from Dover are on their way with
an emergency And youd better get the OR
cranked up because I got a feeling youre
going to pass some gas while I help Trapper
close a little bastards tracheo-esophageal
fistula

INT 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

Three OR nurses are at work getting things on order when the
swinging doors open and Me Lay carrying the two-day-old baby
enters accompanied by Hawkeye and Trapper Nothing has led the
nurses to expect an infant patient and they are distinctly taken
aback

FIRST OR NURSE
Where did that baby come from Is that what
you got us up for

HAWKEYE

Yes ladies thats why we got you up Me
Lay put him down there

(indicating operating

table)
- and get ready to start giving him the
anesthetic

(to nurses)
We stumbled on this deal We didnt want it
but we dont see how we can walk away from
it no matter whose rules are broken This
baby has no legal right to be taken care of
in an Army hospital though his father was
probably an American soldier But hes going
to die if we dont fix him now tonight So
what about it

FIRST OR NURSE
Lets get going

Me Lay places the mask attached to his gas container on the babys
face ans starts to administer a carefully limited quantity

COLONEL MERRILL
This time I will not be intimidated
He has come into the OR while he is talking and he is so menacing
that all preparations are halted while he finishes his
pronouncement

COLONEL MERRILL
I command that this improper and illegal use
of Army facilities cease immediately Twice
you men have forced me into appeasing your
aggression by threatening me with what youll
say to a certain Congressman Well I dont
care what you tell him or anyone else I
dont care if it costs me my command and my
whole career in the Army On this point I
stand as a matter of principle as unshakable
as the Rock of Gibralter

HAWKEYE
Me Lay Trapper

Moving in concert Hawkeye and Trapper grab Colonel Merrill and drag
him over to Me Lays end of the operating table Me Lay takes the
anesthetic mask from the babys face and clamps it firmly on the
Colonels The Colonel struggles for a while but they manage to hold
him and pretty soon he is quiet

the last item of his clothing The Colonel opens his eyes but he is
still too drugged to have any idea where he is or how he got there

ME LAY
Okay Michiko

Michiko moves toward the bed removing the kimono which is her only
garment At the same time Hawkeye grabs a camera which is all ready
for use with a flashbulb attachment and starts to take a series of
shots of the Colonel and Michiko both naked in the bed The Colonel
reacts to the intermittent bursts of light

COLONEL MERRILL
What the hells going on

MICHIKO
Please you no worry sweetheart Just
keeping close

HAWKEYE
(after five or six shots)
All right thats plenty You can put your
clothes on Colonel

Michiko reaches for her kimono and puts it back on as she gets out
of bed The Colonel sits up still a bit dazed but becoming more
aware of whats happening all the time

COLONEL MERILL
Ive been framed

HAWKEYE
Thats what they all say But I have
photographic evidence here that youre a
lecherous old man and a disgrace to the
uniform However I wont even develop the
film if your people watch that baby we
operated on like he was the Congressmans
gradson Which for all we know he may be

wounded More cases are still being brought in from helicopters and
ambulances mainly on stretchers a few under their own power
assisted by a Medical Corpsman or two This is really the most
hideous face of war the mangled bodies and limbs and faces the
expressions alive with pain and dulled by shock are more terrible
than any number of quiescent corpses Trapper finishes examining a
man and speaks to Hot Lips

meanwhile checks his pulse and blood pressure

DUKE
Pulse slow very little pressure

TRAPPER
I dont know what else Youve been that

DUKE
Not enough to be a pro

He moves to another case Duke continues to examine the private with
particular attention to the right side of the head The more he
observes the more alarmed he becomes

(taking hammer and chisel
fortifying himself for the
act)
So here goes

He pounds the chisel into the privates skull and keeps at it till
he cracks his way through Blood flows out in a torrent Duke pulls
his tools away and just watches Very quickly he is rewarded by the
sight of a torrent diminishing to a dribble

he does you and me ought to be ready with a

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT ADMITTING WARD — DAY

Hawkeye is examining a young PRIVATE FIRST CLASS who is in shock
semiconscious and saturated with mud over his whole uniform hair
and skin There is a muddy bloody bandage around his neck

HAWKEYE
(to a corpsman)
Get that bandage off so I can see what the
hells underneath

He moves on to the next stretcher The corpsman undoes the bandage
and pulls it away The Private First Class turns his head to the
left and blood spurts two feet into the air from a hole in the
right side of his neck

PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
Mama Mama Oh Mama Im dying

The blood continues to gush as the people in the immediate vicinity
watch in fascination As it comes down again if falls on the PFCs
face and into his mouth He reacts by coughing spraying his
audience with blood Hawkeye runs back and sticks his index finger
down the hole blocking off the severed artery and stopping the flow
of blood

HAWKEYE

I cant take my finger out Somebody find
Ugly John and get his ass in there

finger on this or we lose him and I cant
get it clamped with my left hand

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT OPERATING ROOM — DAY

The PFC has been transferred to an operating table without Hawkeye
losing his finger pressure on the artery The clothes have been cut
off him and Ugly John has both blood and anesthetic going into him
the latter through an intratracheal tube Hawkeye has a scalpel in
his left hand and with it he enlarges the wound around his right
index finger Then he tries to slide a Kelly clamp down his finger
into the wound to clamp the artery but he cant manage it left-
handed He looks desperately around the OR only to observe that
every surgeon and nurse is fully engaged including Henry and Hot
Lips Ugly John is having a hard time fulfilling his dual function
as it is and cant possibly take on another Hawkeye tried again
with the clamp and fails and then to his great relief there
appears within in his peripheral vision as he concentrates his
attention on the PFCs neck a male figure gowned capped masked
and gloved It doesnt matter to Hawkeye which of his colleagues it
is he just tells him what assistance he needs from him

HAWKEYE
Grab this Kelly ride it down my fingers and
well have this mother under control

The newcomer though Hawkeye doesnt realize it is Dago Red
Following instructions he takes the clamp and inserts it in the
wound

DAGO RED
What do I do with it Hawk This is a little
out of my line

HAWKEYE
Didnt recognize you Red When you get the
clamp all the way down open it as wide as
you can and see if you can close it on the
artery

Dagor Red obeys these orders cautiously When he widens the clamp
and starts to close it again he has the satisfying sensation of
feeling something substantial and siezes it vigorously

DAGO RED
I got it I got it

But what he has grabbed with the clamp is Hawkeyes finger and
Hawkeye by reflex action pulls it out to where we can see it with
the clamp grasping it The blood starts to spurt again and Hawkeye
goes back into the wound but this time with his left index finger

HAWKEYE

You got my finger for Christs sake But
maybe I can do better with my right hand

(inserts a retractor into

wound puts the working

end of it in Dago Reds

hands taking back the

Kelly clamp)
Pull it toward you More Good

(rides clamp down his left

index finger and this time

he closes it on the right

place)

yellow and this time of year it gets even

lighter

HAWKEYE
I guess thats why you go for Hot Lips
Houlihan

DUKE

You know damn well I nearly puke when I look

HAWKEYE
How can you say a thing like that about an
officer in the United States Army

DUKE
I not only say it Ill back it up twenty
bucks worth

Youre a witness

TRAPPER
Okay Im a witness but how do you prove
whos right

DUKE
Theres only one way

EXT SHOWER TENT — NIGHT

Twelve hours later The shower tent is simply an ordinary Army tent
enclosing a row of showers supplied by a water tank on a high
platform in back of the tent Duke and Hawkeye are working under
cover of darkness to loosen each of the stakes that secures the tent
to the ground around it

TIME LAPSE

EXT THE SWAMP — DAY

The following afternnon Trapper and Hawkeye sit in chairs outside
their tent glasses in hand still on their tall hot-weather drink
kick Trapper looks at his watch

TRAPPER
Its five minutes into nurses shower hour
Where are they

HAWKEYE
Theyre coming

EXT MASH COMPOUND — DAY

The Swamp is at the end of the officers row nearest the nurses
tents so they have a good view of the women as they emerge from
their quarters dressed in bathrobes and carrying towels shower caps
and bars of soap The first two to appear are Knocko and Lieutenant
Scorch Next from her own private tent comes Hot Lips

HAWKEYE
Hey Knocko I got those pictures you
promised to look at of my kids You too
Wilma It wont take a minute
(to Hot Lips politely)
You can see them too if you want

HOT LIPS
No thank you Im not the slightest bit
interested
She continues on across the compound and enters the shower tent
Knocko and Lieutentant Scorch come over to the Swamp while Hawkeye
goes inside to find the pictures Then two more nurses emerge from a
tent and head for the showers Trapper gets up and saunters over to
intercept them

EXT SHOWER TENT — DAY

The door of the tent is closed behind Hot Lips and after a moment
there is the sound of water being turned on Then our attention is
drawn to the peak of the tent to which a thin scarcely visible
strand of wire has been attached The wire is drawn taut and runs
across the peak of the barbershop tent next door and down the far
side of it to where Duke sits on the ground operating a sort of
windlass upon which the wire is wound He turns the crank with a
quick burst of energy

Back at the shower tent the force of the wire pulls the canvas
tight the loosened stakes come out of the ground and the whole
tent is whisked right off its center pole revealing Hot Lips nude
under the shower

EXT BARBERSHOP TENT — DAY

Duke abandons his machine and moves to where he can get the crucial
view of Hot Lips The he calls across the compound to Hawkeye

DUKE
Okay Yankee know-it-all Pay up

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT HENRYS TENT — DAY

Hot Lips in her robe her hair still wet from the shower carrying
her towel and shower cap is expressing her wrath forcefully to
Henry ignoring the facts that he is in bed and that Leslie is in
bed with him which explains why we have never seen anybody make a
pass at her

HOT LIPS
This isnt a hospital its an insane asylum
And its your fault because you dont do
anything to discourage them

HENRY
What do you expect me to do

HOT LIPS
Put them under arrest See what a court-
martial thinks of their drunken hooliganism
It started with their calling me Hot Lips and
your letting them get away with it You let
them get away with everything And if you
dont turn them over to the MPs now Im
going to resign my commission and

EXT FRONT OF 4077TH MASH — NIGHT

Two days later An Army car bearing the single star of a brigadier
general drives up to the entrance The sergeant at the wheel jumps
out and open the rear door for General Hammond and his aide a

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT MESS HALL — NIGHT

Most of the officers of 4077th Mash are assembled to listen to
General Hammond Henry and Hot Lips are both in the front row but
separated by some distance and not looking at each other All the
Swampmen are on hand

GENERAL HAMMOND
These are very serious accusations and
without prejudging the charges against him I
am suspending Colonel Blake from all his

conduct myself I will also serve as your
Commanding Officer during that time I shall
be calling on a number of you for your
individual testimony on the points at issue
Thank you Carry on

INT DENTAL CLINIC — NIGHT

Hawkeye Duke and Painless are playing poker with a British a
Norwegian and an Australian officer It is close to two oclock the
same night General Hammond opens the door and looks in doesnt
like what he sees and steps inside All six players are immediately
aware of his presence but decide to act as if they werent

HAWKEYE
(to British Officer who
is dealing)
Gimme three

GENERAL HAMMOND
At ease Captain Pierce you have a seriously
wounded patient for whom you are responsible
Yet I find you in a poker game
HAWKEYE

attention Im a surgeon and I know

HAWKEYE
You betcher ass General

BRITISH OFFICER

PAINLESS

NORWEGIAN OFFICER

Hawkeye and the Australian throw in their hands

GENERAL HAMMOND
Are you going to take care of your patient or
are you going to play poker

BRITISH OFFICER
King-high flush

Painless and the Norwegian throw in their hands and the Englishman
pulls in the pot

HAWKEYE
(to the general)
Im going to play poker until three am or
until the patient is ready for surgery
However if youd like to operate on him
yourself right now be my guest I get the
same dough whether I work or not

GENERAL HAMMOND
I want to talk to you Pierce
HAWKEYE
Theres nothing to talk about General You
take the case yourself or join me at three
oclock Either way youre liable to learn
something

The General is far from pleased with the disrespect accorded him
but as the poker players start a new hand he decides against making
an issue on terms selected by Hawkeye Instead he turns around and
goes out

General Hammond joins Hawkeye at the scrub sink prepared to take
part in the coming operation

HAWKEYE
General at one-thirty when I checked him
last this guy had had less than a pint of
blood and hed lost two or three His pulse
then was 120 and his blood pressure was about
90 Now at three oclock hes had three
pints of blood His pulse is 80 and his
pressure 120 His collapsed lung has been
expanded and hes had a gram of terramycin
intravenously We can operate on him safely
and we should do it quickly but we dont
have to do it frantically or carelessly

TIME LAPSE

INT OPERATING ROOM — NIGHT

Hawkeye has been doing the repair work in the patients belly with
General Hammond functioning as a largely nonparticipating assistant
The incision is still open with sections of bowel on which repairs
have been done still exposed
HAWKEYE
Now General Im going to sandbag you Do
you think were ready to get out of this
belly

GENERAL HAMMOND
Obviously you dont think so and I dont
know why

HAWKEYE
Well Dad we havent found any holes in the
large bowel Theyve all been in the small
bowel but the smell is different I caught a
whiff of large bowel but it aint staring us
in the face right

GENERAL HAMMOND
Right

HAWKEYE
So if it aint staring us in the face its
got to be retroperitoneal And that along
with the look of the wounds makes me figure
hes got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we
wont find unless we look for it

He has been working all the time he has been talking and now after
a little more manipulation within the incision is able to indicate
the perforation he has hypothecated

HAWKEYE
And there it is

GENERAL HAMMOND
Im impressed Pierce Naturally the kind of
job I have I dont get much chance to keep
up with what goes on in the OR

HAWKEYE
Neither does Henry Blake But Ill tell you
what makes him the best CO youve got in

INT THE SWAMP — DAY

The following day General Hammond is having a drink with Hawkeye
Trapper and Duke Ho-Jon keeps the glasses full

TRAPPER
It certainly isnt Henrys fault Hot Lips
Houlihan doesnt like her name

DUKE
Or her figger
HAWKEYE
Shes so square shes even against our having
a football team

This stirs the Generals curiousity but Duke speaks before he has
chance to ask his question

DUKE
You dont think wed be speaking up for a
goddam Regular Army colonel do you if it
wasnt important Begging your pardon
General I forgot

GENERAL HAMMOND
(to Hawkeye)
Football

TRAPPER
Anybody you replaced Henry with couldnt
last We guarantee that

GENERAL HAMMOND
I didnt know you had a football team

HAWKEYE
Well its still pretty much in the talk
stage

GENERAL HAMMOND
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall I
coached the boys myself

HAWKEYE
I think I heard about that

GENERAL HAMMOND
Now were working out a schedule of the
outfits were going to play this year We all
chip into a pool and make bets

HAWKEYE
Must be fun But the point we want to make
about Henry

GENERAL HAMMOND
(rising)
Im sure we could find a date for your team
Why dont I take it up with Henry
(exiting)
Thanks for the drink boys

After the General has left the other two Swampmen look at Hawkeye
uncomprehendingly

DUKE
Where the hell we going to get us a football
team
HAWKEYE
All three of us played for our schools And
there are at least four other guys

TRAPPER
But hes got five times the man-power to draw
on

HAWKEYE
We can balance that by getting ourselves a
ringer Henry has to say he needs a
neurosurgeon and put in a specific request
for Dr Oliver Harmon Jones

DUKE
Never heard of him

HAWKEYE
Sure you have only as Spearchucker Jones

DUKE
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles

TRAPPER
He only lasted one season

HAWKEYE
On account he got caught in the doctor draft
He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro
ball weekends when the Eagles signed him

DUKE
How come nobody knows about him And you do

HAWKEYE
I worked with Spearchucker my first month
over here at the 72nd Evac in Taegu Most of
the colored guys know who he is but theyre
not talking because he asked them not to

TRAPPER
So what makes you think hell play for us

HAWKEYE
Well cut him in on the bets we make And
still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to
college

TRAPPER
Might make kind of a social issue not having
any other Negro officer

HAWKEYE
He can move in here with us

DUKE
Now wait a minute Hawkeye I come a long
way learning to put up with a couple of
crazy Yankees but
HAWKEYE
Dont tell me about your problems boy
Explain them to Ho-Jon

Henry nervous at what he thinks is going to be his showdown with
General Hammond is startled by the Generals unexpected proposal

GENERAL HAMMOND
If we had closer relations there wouldnt be
any misunderstandings Thats where a

HENRY
A football game

GENERAL HAMMOND
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it
They say its one of the main gimmicks we
have to keep the American way of life going
here in Asia

HENRY

TIME LAPSE

EXT LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH — DAY

It is September A helicopter descends to the ground in the familiar
location and as on earlier occasions Medical Corpsmen come from
the hospital to aid in unloading it But this time the cargo
instead of wounded men turns out to be boxes which the corpsmen rip
open and which contains football uniforms black shoes cardinal red
jerseys white helmets and white pants

TIME LAPSE

EXT FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS LATRINE — DAY

A day or two later Fifteen men are wearing uniforms from the
chopper load Practice at this point is confined to kicking and
passing the three footballs at their disposal and the uniforms
still look clean and new Trapper is a good passer Hawkeye is a
better-than-average receiver and Duke punts well but generally
speaking the balls are dropped more often than they are caught and
the overall effect is pretty ragged Among the other players are
Vollmer Ugly John Boone Painless and Judson On the sidelines
watching are Henry with a whistle tied to a piece of rubber
hospital tubing around his neck and in uniform SPEARCHUCKER a
very big broad-shouldered black man in his early thirties

SPEARCHUCKER
If I can make a suggestion Coach

HENRY
The way I run an organization any man in it
has the right to speak his mind

SPEARCHUCKER
In that case here are ten basic plays I
think thats about all this bunch can handle

He hands Henry ten sheets of paper on each of which a running or
pass play is diagrammed down to the finest detail

HENRY
Thank you Spearchucker Ill certainly take
a look at these Where the hell did you ever
get that name

SPEARCHUCKER
I used to throw the javelin

Hawkeye catches a pass from Trapper and runs with the ball right to
where Henry and Spearchucker are standing

HAWKEYE
Listen we look pretty lousy out there
right

SPEARCHUCKER

Well for college players that have been out
of training seven or eight years

HAWKEYE
Im thinking about how we can make more
money
(to Henry)

Suppose we bet only part of our dough and
keep this big animal out of the game the
whole first half and let them roll up some
points Then you could bet the rest of our
bundle between the halves and get the General
and his friends to give us some real odds

HENRY
Its a nice idea I mean it has style

HAWKEYE
Its the only way we can make enough to put
Ho-Jon through Androscoggin

EXT ATHLETIC FIELD 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL — DAY
It is November The Mash team in uniform comes out of the quonset

hut assigned to it as dressing quarters Already on the bench toward
which the players head are a few supporters including Dago Red
Knocko and Leslie Radar is also there serving as water boy
Spearchucker has a blanket wrapped over his head and held together
at the chin to eliminate the chance of his being recognized as he
looks over their opponents who now file out of their quonset hut
The first notable thing about them is that they number twenty-five
as opposed to a total of fifteen in uniform for the Mash team
Second is the even more discouraging fact that two of them one
black and one white are enormous bigger than Spearchucker The
uniforms are orange and black

SPEARCHUCKER
Those two big guys were tackles on the
Cleveland Browns and the redhead played
halfback with the Rams

HENRY
They cant do that to me

HAWKEYE
The bastards outconned us

SPEARCHUCKER
I think we could still have a chance

HAWKEYE
If you start the game instead of waiting you
mean

SPEARCHUCKER

No lets stick to that strategy till we see
whether you boys can do two things The first
is get that halfback out of the game He had
one year with the Rams before the Army got
him but he didnt play too often because
hes one of those hot dogs

DUKE
What

SPEARCHUCKER
When he sees a little running room he likes
to make a show you know stutter steps and
cross-overs and all that jazz Also he never
learned to button up when he gets hit so if
you two can get a good shot at him once you
can hurt him

HAWKEYE
But wed have to break his leg or something
to keep him out of the game for good

TRAPPER
Not necessarily

UGLY JOHN
As long as theres a pile-up we can do our
bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal
from the contest
TRAPPER
Its a technique Ugly John and I worked out
in case something like this came up

DUKE
(gazing across at
opposition tackles)
Look at the size of those two beasts

HAWKEYE
I dont think I could hurt one of them with a
sledgehammer

SPEARCHUCKER
You can make them run Theyve got the
occupational disease of oversized ex-
athletes Theyre carrying thirty pounds
extra apiece So we run everything wide
wide wide make them move more then they
want to on every play

EXT ATHLETIC FIELD 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL — DAY

The Mash team is lined up to kick off which is Dukes function
There is only one official a REFEREE dressed in conventional
white

HAWKEYE
The pro halback is playing safety Kick it to
anybody else

Duke accordingly kicks the ball about thirty yards and angled to his
left But the player who takes it on the thirty-yard line simply
runs to his left and back a little toward his own goal line in order
to hand it to the RAM HALFBACK as he charges downfield from his
safety position He sidesteps stright-arms or otherwise eludes all
eleven of the Mash players and runs unimpeded for a touchdown A few
moments later he kicks the ball over the bar for the point after
touchdown

HENRY
(screaming from sidelines)
Stop him Stop that man

DUKE
(as they line up to
receive)
Sure you just blindfold him first and tie
him to a stake

Duke is the one to receive the kickoff which he takes on the ten
He runs it back about twenty yards dodging several enemy tacklers
then sees the black tackle from Cleveland bearing down on him Duke
runs back and forth sideways a few times not gaining any ground but
making the other man move

DUKE
Hawkeye
He throws a lateral pass to Hawkeye toward whom both tackles from
Cleveland now run Hawkeye leads them almost from one side of the
field to the other then reverses direction keeping them on the
move till he sees a chance to throw a lateral to Trapper

SPEARCHUCKER
(from the bench)
Thats the stuff Run the hams off those big
hogs

Trapper returns the ball to Duke who manages to make a couple of
yards forward and a lot more sideways before the Ram halfback cuts
him down from the rear The Mash team goes into its first huddle

TRAPPER
(to huddle)
Okay dont give them a chance to get their
breath Hawkeye wide to the right

They are near the sideline to their left playing a winged T
formation Trapper takes the ball from Vollmer the center runs
back as if to pass but really gives it to Hawkeye at left half as
Hawkeye goes by him in a wide sweep that takes him all the way to
the right sideline with the two Cleveland tackles in pursuit
Hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to get by them but one of them
brings him down for a gain of no more than two yards

On the next play Trapper really goes back to pass but his blockers
are of no use against the pro tackles whome he sees descending on
him Trapper starts running straight back for a while then makes a
dash to the right followed by a dash to the left He is almost
tackled again and his only route of escape is back toward his own
goal line

SPEARCHUCKER
(from the sideline)
Throw it Throw it

Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards Trapper spots Hawkeye
in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the ball to him
Hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him and he goes
down almost immediately for no gain on the play Moving faster than
they have to in order not to give the opposition any rest the team
huddles

TRAPPER
(to huddle)
Wide to the left Duke youre the pace-
setter this time

They go into action again This time Trapper taking the ball from
Vollmer gives it to Duke who makes a feint at an off-tackle play
then turns back and into a wide end run instead Duke is still a
good ball carrier by college standards and he has little trouble
shaking off the amateurs who try to tackle him and is thus able to
make it a running duel with the professionals When they finally nab
him he is no more than two or three yards ahead of the scrimmage
line but the ex-tackles from Cleveland are visibly panting and
wishing they hadnt allowed all that extra poudage to accumulate On
the fourth down of course they have to punt Duke goes back to
receive the ball from Vollmer at center

HAWKEYE
Dont try to get it far down Kick it up high
so we can get there and surround that son-of-
a-bitch

DUKE
Yeah if I can

He does a good job of it The kick is high enough so there are
several red jerseys around the Ram halfback when he gets under it
He raises his right arm for a fair catch The would-be Mash
tacklers including Hawkeye and Trapper are frustrated They array
themselves defensively while their opponents have a huddle and line
up to take the offense

HAWKEYE
(to Duke and Trapper)
Lets get him this time I dont think
theyve got anyone else who can carry the
ball

As Hawkeye anticipated the opposing quarterback slips the ball to
the Ram halfback who starts to go wide of the tackle sees Hawkeye
untouched by blockers closing in from the outside and makes his
beautiful cross-over to cut back in At the same time he is hit at
the knees by Hawkeye and high by Duke And there are quite a few
other Mash players in the immediate vicinity Trapper and Ugly John
in the forefront so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the
flashy halfback

A close look at Ugly John reveals him to be reaching inside his
jersey and under a shoulder pad from which he extracts a hypodermic
needle With the skill of an expert anesthesiologist he pulls up the
sleeve of the tackled and stunned halfback and plunges the needle
into his arm

The Referee meanwhile is indignantly pulling at the Mash players on
top of the pile and orally expressing his disapproval

REFEREE
Get off the guy Hes tackled You dont all
need to jump on

The Mash players quickly remove themselves Duke and Hawkeye are the
last to get up Remaining on the ground is the former halfback for
the Rams still firmly clutching the ball but looking as if he
needed to get a lot of air into his lungs His captain the white
pro tackle takes one look at him and speaks to the Referee

325TH CAPTAIN
Time Time

The Referee blows his whistle to stop the clock The captain waves
for assistance from the sidelines and the trainer and water boy
come running in Radar also appears from the opposite sideline with
water for his team Ugly John takes advantage of his presence to
slip the hypodermic he has been concealing in his hand into Radars
pocket

Meanwhile there is agreement in the opposition camp that the Ram
halfback should go out of the game for a while to rest up A couple
of his teammates assist him to the bench The Mash players observe
this

TRAPPER
Well hes taken care of Scratch one hot
dog

DUKE

You really think we hurt him that bad

TRAPPER
Hell no all you did was knock the wind out
of him But he wont be playing any more
football today

It is between the halves and the Generals players are resting

looking groggy Henry sticks his head in the door

TIME LAPSE
EXT ATHLETIC FIELD 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL — DAY

The two teams have taken the field again Hawkeye has switched to
left end Spearchucker replacing him in the backfield This time
General Hammonds men are kicking off to Henrys Its a long kick
but it doesnt go toward the center of the goal line where
Spearchucker is waiting for it but to Duke who runs toward
Spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral

The two pro tackles from the Browns run down the field so as to
converge on Spearchucker around the Mash twenty-five But the other
Mash players divide themselves into equal units of five to do
nothing but take out the two tackles The other opposing players are
no problem for Spearchucker who runs around or right through them
and crosses their goal line for a touchdown The ball is brought out
for the extra point which Duke scores with a place kick Before the
teams reassamble for the next kickoff the captain of the 325th team
detours a few yards toward his bench and calls something to General
Hammond whose reaction is to stand up and shake his fist in Henrys
direction On the Mash bench Radar leans over to Henry

RADAR
General Hammond sir has just been informed
about the identity of Captain Jones His
ringers recognized our ringer

On the field Duke is preparing to kick off

HAWKEYE
(to Spearchucker)
Whats the matter

SPEARCHUCKER
We may be in trouble I cant catch my
breath Ive got the occupational disease of
oversized ex-athletes

TIME LAPSE

EXT ATHLETIC FIELD 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL — DAY

Spearchucker is trying to block or intercept a forward pass but the
two tackles from Cleveland still have enough strength left to put
him out of action with their combined efforts They block him so
forcibly in fact that he drops to the ground and has some trouble
getting up The pass is completed and the receiver tackled on the
Mash thirty-five yard line

SPEARCHUCKER
Timeout
(to Referee as latter
blows whistle)
How much left

REFEREE
Minute and twenty-five seconds And thats a

first down

Radar comes out to the Mash huddle with his water-bucket and towels
SPEARCHUCKER
We got to stop them right here

DUKE
And get ourselves another touchdown to win
(looking to opponents

huddle)
I wish to hell we knew what they were
plotting
HAWKEYE
(getting an idea)
Radar

RADAR

All you have to do is ask

(concentrates on the

huddle twelve yards away)
The quarterback is saying theyll run the old
Statue of Liberty Their left end will come
across and take the ball out of his hand and
try to get around our left end

SPEARCHUCKER
What else

RADAR
Everyones talking at once but now the
captain is telling them to shut up The
quarterback says if the Statue of Liberty
doesnt work theyll go into the double wing
with the left halfback taking the handoff
first and then slipping it to the right
halfback heading to the left

The Referee blows the whistle and the two teams line up to resume
action The 325th Evac quarterback drops back as if to pass his
left end starts to his right and the whole Mash eleven starts to
their left Only Ugly John finds himself temporarily buried under a
265-pound tackle The other ten men in red meet the enemy left end
after he takes the ball off the quarterbacks hand and they bring
him down for a loss The opposing team goes into another huddle but
their strategy remains as Radar overheard it When the left halfback
starts to his right the Mash players start to their right and
after the right halfback takes over possession and tries to turn in
he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered Spearchucker hits him first
with a tackle so fierce it throws him back five yards and induces
him to fumble the ball A pile of half a dozen MASH players pounces
on it causing some damage to each other

SPEARCHUCKER
(to Referee)
Time

He goes over to the Referee and exchanges a few words with him then
walks into his teams huddle
TRAPPER
(to Spearchucker)
You got to be the one Were all agreed on
that

SPEARCHUCKER
No its too far and were all too bushed I
just told the referee were going to try
something different We make the center
eligible by

VOLLMER
Me I cant catch a pass

SPEARCHUCKER

You dont have to We line up with everybody
to the right of center except Hawkeye who
drops back a yard just before the snap At
the same time Duke moves to the right side of
the line

(to Vollmer )
That makes you eligible but all you have to
do is take the ball right back from Trapper
between your legs and hide it under your
belly Trapper you make like you got the
ball fake to me and keep going One of the
big guys will hit you maybe both

TRAPPER
No I only got my GI insurance

SPEARCHUCKER
(to Vollmer )
As soon as that happens Sergeant you start
walking not running to their goal line
Remember that dont run Come on we just
got time

They break out of the huddle and line up as directed with all the
linemen except Hawkeye on Vollmers right Their opponents have
trouble adjusting to this and are even more confused when just as
Trapper bends down to take the ball from Vollmer Hawkeye steps back
into the backfield and Duke squeezes into the already crowded right
line Returning the ball to Vollmer Trapper turns his back fakes a
pitchout to Spearchucker who is racing toward the line and
continues backward holding himself as if he still had the ball and
were fading for a long pass So successfully does he create this
impression that the two tackles from Cleveland seeing clearly that
Spearchucker hasnt received the ball descend on Trapper with their
last burst of energy Two other orange-and-black linemen also fall
on top of him Meanwhile Vollmer holding his arms crossed under
his stomach to further hide the ball and looking as if her were
suffering from a painful blow beneath the belt starts walking down
the field at an angle toward his own sideline making the opposition
think he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injury
Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty looks back to
where Trappers tacklers are beginning to remove themselves but
also notes out of the corner of his eye that only the opposing
safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and that he isnt paying much
attention to him
From the bench a frantic Henry looks indignantly at the sight of his
center and Sergeant Major coming off the field

HENRY
Whats going on What the hell are you doing

He opens his arms enough for Henry to see the pigskin cradled there

HENRY
Then run for Gods sake Run

Vollmer begins to run straight toward the goal line which has the
unfortunate effect of alerting the safety man to what is happening
He races across the field to cut Vollmer off Spearchucker starts
into motion at the same instant and gets down there so fast that
just as the safety man is tackling Vollmer in a way that would throw
him out of bounds on the two-yard line Spearchucker hurls himself
against the safety man with a strong and well-aimed block that sends
both men across the goal line

General Hammond runs onto the field in vehement protest

GENERAL HAMMOND

The Referee looking at his watch and raising his Army 45 to signal
the end of the game goes over to meet the General and explain the
sad truth to him

INT MASH TEAMS DRESSING ROOM — DAY

exhausted to begin that process Trapper is stretched out on a
bench apparently unconscious Henry enters triumphantly waving a
thick stack of paper money

TIME LAPSE

EXT FRONT OF 4077TH MASH — EVENING

A covered Army truck pulls up with the victorious football team
breaking the normal rule for hospital zones by singing a boisterous
old drinking song Several of them have bottles in their hands as
they descend to the ground Hawkeye and Duke are among the first and
the noisiest until they notice Lapham (the new surgeon we saw the
first time during the deluge) standing under the light at the
hospital entrance There is something in his expression that makes
them break off their singing abruptly Trapper and Spearchucker
jumping down after them react the same way and their sudden
silence affects the others so that in a matter of seconds the
singing has died out entirely Hawkeye and Duke run toward the
hospital entrance Trapper and Spearchucker a little behind them

BRIEF TIME LAPSE

INT AT HO-JONS BEDSIDE — EVENING
Ho-Jon is unconscious Lapham holds an X-ray while Trapper scans it

TRAPPER
Its a massive one

The X-ray is passed on to Hawkeye Duke and Spearchucker in turn

SPEARCHUCKER
Isnt he awful young

TRAPPER
Thats the artery we sewed up last summer
Had to end up smaller that much easier for
the thrombosis to occur

Ho-Jon opens his eyes slowly reacting to the pressure of all the
doctors

HAWKEYE
Pain bad Ho-Jon

HO-JON
(with considerable effort)
I — wouldnt wish it on a man-
eating — shark

TRAPPER
(to Lapham)
More demerol

Lapham goes off to get the medication

HO-JON
You — must open — me up again

DUKE
No Ho-Jon were not going to open you up

Dukes words are intentionally ambiguous and when Ho-Jon looks from
one doctor to another to find the real meaning of them they all try
not to reveal it But he knows

TIME LAPSE

INT DENTAL CLINIC — DAY

Hawkeye and Trapper are in a stud poker game along with Painless
Vollmer Radar a helicopter pilot and the Norwegian Officer we saw
playing before There is an entrance to the hospital visible through
a window and an ambulance is parked outside it

VOLLMER
Pair of sevens1ll say a buck

The ambulance driver and another soldier come out of the hospital

bearing a shrouded corpse on a stretcher Hawkeye choosing not to
call the bet turns over his cards stands up restlessly and sees

the body on the stretcher Trapper who has a view out the window

from the seat also sees it and the effect on him is to take his

attention momentarily from the game

PAINLESS
Make it two

The helicopter pilot folds his hand and its Trappers turn to be
next Radar who is dealing waits a moment to see if he has to be
reminded

RADAR
Two dollars to you Trapper

Ho-Jons body is tossed into the back of the ambulance Trapper
checks his cards and turns them over

TRAPPER
Sorry Im out

barracks bags they arrived with more than a year before There is a
small group gathered to say goodbye including Dago Red Lapham and
Vollmer who is Regular Army but none of the others who were part
of the outfit when they first arrived When they are all ready to
take off Hawkeye and Duke go back inside the Swamp

drink Trapper is already holding

A couple of days later Hawkeye and Duke are inspecting the
troopship on which they will make the long voyage to Seattle They
have undergone a startling transformation they have had shaves and
haircuts and they have abandoned their fatigues for clean new-
looking uniforms with Eisenhower jackets adorned with their proper
insignia including a caduceus of the Medical Corps There is a lot
of activity on board the ship and on the dock where a MEDICAL CORPS
SERGEANT with a notebook accosts them

MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT

EXT HARBOR — DAY

The big troopship is making its way out of the harbor and heading
for open ocean

EXT TROOPSHIP — DAY

A SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT walks along the deck at the
officers end of the ship
SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
Captain Limburger Captain Camembert

All he gets in response are funny looks and laughter By the time he
comes near where Hawkeye and Duke are standing the Sergeant is
beginning to wonder if there is something peculiar about the names
he is calling For added protection Hawkeye and Duke have replaced
their Medical Corps insignia with the simple cross of the Chaplains
Corps

SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
Captain Camembert Captain Camembert

HAWKEYE
Excuse me Sergeant

SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
Yes Reverend

HAWKEYE
What do you want with those two medical
officers

SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT

inspection

DUKE

SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT

DUKE
The reason theyre being shipped home is
theyre the two biggest fairies in the Far
East Command

HAWKEYE

held

SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT

me off

Pierce do you

HAWKEYE
They missed the boat

SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT
(making a note)
Thanks

HAWKEYE
Glad to help
The Segeant goes off in one direction Duke and Hawkeye in another
Pretty soon they come across a dice game and stop to watch

DUKE
This a closed game or you take anybodys
dough

A couple of the DICE PLAYERS look up and react adversely to the
Chaplains Corps insignia

FIRST DICE PLAYER
Well almost anybodys

SECOND DICE PLAYER
(apologetically to Duke)
Kind of a rough game Reverend

DUKE
Hell man that dont matter Were loaded
We were big wheels in the black market in
Seoul

HAWKEYE
Plus running the opium concession for the
whole Eighth Army

These confessions arouse the interest of all the players One a
SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN looks at them intently then smiles

SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN
Theyre not chaplains at all Theyre doctors
from the 4077th Mash I had a piece of steel
dug out of my back there

The player who told them it was a rough game an infantry captain
extends his hand to greet them

SECOND DICE PLAYER
Pleasure to have you Lot of my men went
through your outfit

HAWKEYE
Glad to know you Listen were ducking
short-arm inspection but our cover isnt
going to last long How would you two boys
like to do us a favor Be Forrest and Pierce
of the Medical Corps between here and
Seattle

SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN
We wouldnt know how to go about it

HAWKEYE

Nothing to it You just turn a chair around
backwards and rest your chin on the top You
sit there with a big cigar in your mouth and
and every now and then just to show youre
looking you say ‘Dont wave it so close to
my cigar soldier Thats all you do You
cant go wrong
