INT ROBS APARTMENT - NIGHT
STEREO
Not a minisystem not a matching set but coveted
audiophile
clutter of McIntosh and Nakamichi each component from
a
different era bought piece by piece in various
nanoseconds
of being flush
ROB (VO)
What came first The music or the
misery People worry about kids
playing with guns and watching violent
videos were scared that some sort
of culture of violence is taking
them over
RECORDS
Big thin LPs Fields of them We move across them
slowly
they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books
but
then the CDs start and go on faster and faster
forever

then the singles then the tapes

ROB (VO)
But nobody worries about kids
listening to thousands -- literally
thousands -- of songs about broken

hearts and rejection and pain and
until
that

and

out
head
what he

time

immediately

moment
to

to

misery and loss
It seems the records tapes and CDs will never end
we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place a face
grows on you He sits in an oversized beanbag chair
addresses us the wall of music behind him

ROB

Did I listen to pop music because I

was miserable or was I miserable

because I listened to pop music
INT APARTMENT - NIGHT
Group of bags huddled next to the door Not the go-on-
vacation set but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving
variety Rob stares at them his face unreadable his

gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones We hear

is hearing something foreboding and upbeat at the same

LAURA Robs girlfriend enters the room and he

pulls the headphones off She clocks him for a moment
catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated

of nonpresence She begins to heft the bags Rob goes
her a little tardy for his big goodbye Laura begins
cry a bit

LAURA
I dont really know what Im doing

He smiles and she doesnt He adjusts

ROB
You dont have to go this second
You can stay until whenever

LAURA
Weve done the hard part now I
might as well you know
backs

physically

ROB
Well stay for tonight then

Laura shakes her head lifts the last small bag and
out the door A strap catches on a handle and the two
them wrestle with it a bit while trying to keep the
open until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and
door shuts behind Rob He stays right there staring at
shut door for a long moment listening to the fading

of Laura and her dragging bags

STEREO

Robs left hand cranks the volume knob while his right
switches the CD changer to something loud and adrenal

addresses us again

ROB
My desert-island all-time top five
most memorable break-ups in
chronological order are as follows
Alison Ashworth Penny Hardwick
Jackie Allen Charlie Nicholson
Sarah Kendrew

INT APARTMENT STAIRWELL

Laura drags her bags banging down the stairs --
INT ROBS APARTMENT
Rob moves around the apartment seeming to expand

looking for change as he continues

ROB

Those were the ones that really hurt
Can you see your name in that list
Laura Maybe youd sneak into the
top ten but theres no place for

you in the top five Sorry Those
places are reserved for the kind of
humiliations and heartbreaks that
youre just not capable of delivering

facing
emerge

across

CUT TO

make-

He adjusts the angle of the TV stuffs a creepy family
portrait into a drawer

ROB
That probably sounds crueler than
its meant to but the fact is were
too old to take each other miserable
Unhappiness used to mean something
Now its just a drag like a cold or
having no money

He moves through the living room to an open window
the street Looking down two stories he sees Laura
from the building and drag her bags toward her car
the street

ROB

If you really wanted to mess me up
you should have got to me earlier

EXT SUBURBAN PARK - DUSK -
Rob and Alison sit on the bench kissing awkwardly

ROB (VO)
Which brings us to number one Alison
Ashworth

PARK BENCH - DUSK
The same shot the next night new clothes same clumsy

out session

ROB (VO)
My relationship with Alison Ashworth
lasted six hours

PARK BENCH - DUSK

Next night

ROB (VO)
The two hours after school and before
The Rockford Files three days in a
row On the fourth afternoon
SAME PARK BENCH
And the fourth night

ROB (VO)
Kevin Bannister

Alison and another boy KEVIN BANNISTER Kissing In
the

background Rob approaches and stops He implodes with
self-

consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a
casual

gait as he mopes away

ROB (VO)
It would be nice to think that since
I was fourteen times have changed
relationships have become more
sophisticated females less cruel
skins thicker but there still seems
to be an element of that afternoon
in everything that has happened to
me since All my other romantic
stories seem to be a scrambled version
of that first one

INT ROBS APARTMENT

Rob sits in his chair a cord leading from the stereo
to

headphones draped around his neck Behind him is the
wall

of music

ROB
Number two Penny Hardwick Penny
was great-looking and her top five
recording artists were Carly Simon
Carole King James Taylor Cat
Stevens and Elton John

He lets the needle down on the turntable next to him

Nobody Does It Better by Carly Simon begins to play

and continues as SOUNDTRACK PENNY 16 is walking
the grass toward us Shes the clean sporty nice
girl-next-door She waves to off-camera friends
winning smile
ROB (VO)
Everybody liked her She was nice
Nice manners Nice grades Nice-
looking
INT PENNYS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Penny and Rob sit on the edge of the bed kissing Rob
his hand up toward the breast but the hand then seems
have a new idea and dives south to follow the thigh
Pennys skirt
ROB (VO)
She was so nice in fact that she
wouldnt let me put my hand
underneath or even on top of her
bra

when he contacts skin Penny rolls like a gymnast

and off of the bed out of frame Rob looks away

EXT STREET - NIGHT
Nobody Does It Better continues as Rob walks Penny to

front door She is smiling he seems distant

ROB (VO)
Penny was nice but I wasnt
interested in nice just breasts
and therefore she was no good to me
And so I was finished with her

She leans in to kiss him and he shrugs her off
ROB

Whats the point It never goes
anywhere
Without looking at her Rob turns and walks down the
street
getting smaller Penny watches for a while

CUT TO
INT EL TRAIN CAR - MORNING - PRESENT
Rob sways with the other commuters

ROB
She cried and I hated her for it
because she made me feel bad I
started dating a girl who everybody
said would put out and Penny went
with this asshole Chris Thompson who
told me that he had sex with her
after something like three dates
How had Penny gone from a girl who
wouldnt do anything to a girl who
would do everything

A BUSINESSMAN looks up from his paper at Rob then back
down

EXT CLARK STREET - DAY

An old Chicago block of local merchants on a busy
street

Rob makes his way down the street jangling a set of
keys
and talking to us

ROB
My stores right up here Its called
The Record Exchange Its carefully
placed to attract the bare minimum
of window shoppers

Rob arrives at a storefront and begins unlocking a
rusty
gate with two locks and then a beaten-down door

ROB
I get by because of the people who
make a special effort to shop here
on Saturday young men always young
men who spend a disproportionate
amount of their time looking for
deleted Smiths singles and original
windows
to

rug
you

to

people

causing
reverence
empty

church

and

admitting

INT RECORD STORE - DAY
In almost darkness More light might penetrate the
if there werent so many record-release posters taped
them A dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag
On the walls are bagged 45s you will never hear unless
commit your life to the losing proposition of listening
every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other
youve never heard of
But as Rob opens the door enters and flips a switch
the fluorescents to sputter we see in his eyes the
and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an
field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty
ROB

The fetish properties are not unlike

porn I would feel guilty taking

their money if I wasnt kind of

well one of them
As he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back
stops on a dime steps back and pulls a CD from the sea
replaces it almost the same position but not quite --
meticulousness and pride in this gesture
After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob
DICK a nervous forlorn but sweet and intelligent
with long greasy black hair a Sonic Youth T-shirt a
monstrous pair of headphones and a canvas record bag

emblazoned with a label logo

ROB
Morning Dick
DICK
Oh hi Hi Rob

ROB

DICK
Yeah OK I found the first Licorice
Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl The

DICK

ROB
(resigned)
Okay

INT RECORD STORE - LATER

Dick is behind the counter Rob in the aisles with a
clipboard
doing inventory

ROB
(re music)
Whats this
DICK
The new Belle and Sebastian Like
it

The door flies open and BARRY an acid-tongued post-

punk
rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to
conceptualize his own rebellion walks in His teeth
are
clenched in air-guitar concentration and hes
phonetically
cranking a Clash riff
BARRY
BAA BA BA DANG
Dick shrinks back from him instinctively He stops
mid-step
and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store
His
face adopts an exaggerated grimace
BARRY
Holy Shiite What the fucks this
DICK
Its the new --
ROB
Its the record weve been listening
to and enjoying Barry
Barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter and
Dick
gets out of his way
BARRY
Well thats problematic because it
sucks ass
He pops the CD out and frisbees it to Dick
BARRY
(re the CD)
Yours I assume
Barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in
How
to Kill a Radio Consultant by Public Enemy comes
through at

through the red levels
ROB
(over the blare)
TURN IT OFF BARRY

BARRY
IT WONT GO ANY LOUDER

Barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and
disappears

Rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape
Barrys
head pops out of the stockroom

BARRY
What are you doing

ROB
I dont want to hear Public Enemy
right now

BARRY
Public Enemy All Im trying to do

Barry bristles and moves slowly in on Dick

BARRY

DICK
Nothing

BARRY

No not nothing Whats wrong with
the Righteous Brothers

DICK
Nothing I just prefer the other

BARRY
Bullshit

ROB
How can it be bullshit to state a
preference

BARRY

Since when did this shop become a
fascist regime

ROB
Since you brought that bullshit tape
in
BARRY
(sarcastic)

Great Thats the fun of working in
a record store Playing crappy pap
you dont want to listen to I
thought this tape was going to be
you know a conversation stimulator
I was going to ask you for your top
five records to play on a Monday
morning and all that and you just
had to ruin it

ROB
Well do it next Monday

BARRY
Well whats the point in that

From outside HEAR THE SOUND OF SKATEBOARD WHEELS

CLACKING

AND SCRAPING GETTING LOUDER Rob Dick and Barry stop

fighting to listen then each moves purposefully to a
spot

in the store Dick to the register Barry to the back
Rob

next to the door as if bracing for a street fight

The SOUND gets closer then stops The door swings
open to

admit VINCE and JUSTIN two fifteen-year-old skate
punks

Vinces hair is post-apocolyptically hacked to
different

lengths Justins in uniformly shaven with leopard
spots

move

Dick counters from his perch getting another angle
Barry

cracks his knuckles threateningly Vince and Justin do

cup with piece of paper attached that says Please

onto the counter Dick begins counting it out

VINCE

DICK
Yes

VINCE
That sucks Get it

Dick cracks a sad smile for a second He bags the CD
Vince and Justin are off Rob walks back through the

room door

INT RECORD STORE - STOCK ROOM - LATER
Rob is on his knees opening boxes with a razor knife
talks to us as he works
ROB
Im sick of the sight of this place

Dick sticks his head in the door looks at Rob looks

Rob is looking (camera) and retreats back through the

Rob continues

ROB
Im afraid Ill go berserk rip the
Elvis Costello mobile from the
ceiling throw the Country Artists
Male A-K rack out onto the streets

He hears the bell on the front door RING and he stops
and
listens looks a bit worried

BARRY (0S)

Rob relaxes and goes back to work

CUSTOMER (0S)

Rob deflates shaking his head

Barry leans back elbows up on the counter behind him
talking

to the CUSTOMER a middle-aged graying man in a
raincoat

ROB

standing in the doorway of the stock room He feigns
applause

ROB
Nice Barry

BARRY
Rob Top five musical crimes
perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the
80s and 90s Subquestion -- is
it in fact unfair to criticize a
formerly great artist for his latter-
day sins Is it better to burn out
than to fade away

ROB
You just drove a fucking customer
away Barry

BARRY
We didnt even really have it I
happen to know for a fact that the
only Stevie Wonder single we have is
Dont Drive Drunk I was just
goofing on the straight and it never
cost you a penny
ROB
Not the point

BARRY
Oh so whats the point then

ROB
I dont want you talking to our
customers like that again

BARRY
Our customers You think that Mr
LL Bean out there is going to be a
regular

Robs face begins to redden with anger

ROB
Barry Im fucking broke I know we
used to fuck with anyone who asked
for anything we didnt like but
its gotta stop

BARRY
Bullshit The guy was going to buy
one record -- which we didnt even
have -- and leave and never come

back again anyway Why not have a
little fun Big fucking deal

ROB
What did he ever do to you

BARRY
He offended me with his terrible
taste

ROB

It wasnt even his terrible taste
It was his daughters

BARRY

Oh now youre defending that
motherfucker Youre going soft in
your old age Rob There was a time
when you would have chased him out
of the store and up the street Now
all of a sudden Im offending your
golf buddy

(sarcastic)
Youre right Rob I am so sorry
jerking

How are we ever going to make enough
money to get you and Laura into the
country club

Rob is red and seething

BARRY
And by the way I tell you this for
your own good Thats the worst
sweater Ive ever seen I have never
seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone

disgrace to the human race

Rob springs on Barry grabbing him by the lapels and

him up against the wall Rob is so mad he cant say

DICK
Hey guys Hey

Rob runs out of steam and drops Barry who backpedals

BARRY
(extremely shaken)
What are you some kind of fucking
maniac If this jackets torn youre
gonna pay big

Barry stomps out of the store Rob turns and goes back
the stockroom and sits on the stepladder Dick
the doorway terrified

DICK
Are you all right

ROB
Yeah Im sorry Look Dick Laura

we ever see Barry again maybe you
can tell him that

DICK
Course I will Rob No problem
No problem at all Ill tell him

Rob nods Dick sets out into the uncharted
conversational
territory of interpersonal relationships

DICK
Ive ah got some other stuff to
tell him anyway so its no problem
Tll just tell him about you know
Laura when I tell him the other
stuff

ROB
Fine

DICK

likes you Its just that --

ROB

DICK
Sure Course Rob look Do you

Number three in the top five break-
ups was Charlie Nicholson sophomore
year of college Some people never
got over Nam or the night their
band opened for Nirvana I guess I
never really got over Charlie

EXT COLLEGE QUAD - DAY - FLASHBACK
About twenty feet away we see a tall thin beauty

blonde hair cropped short in darling 80s new-wave

She is speaking animatedly to a PAMPHLETEER driving
points home with a forefinger

ROB (VO)
She looked different Dramatic
Exotic She talked a lot about
remarkably interesting things like
music books film and politics

INT CAFE - DAY
A younger Rob sits amongst a group of STUDENTS who are
in a heated conversation He is smiling mouth closed
happy to be there Charlie sitting next to him

Charlie gives Rob a quick kiss and keeps talking
EXT STREET - AFTERNOON

Rob and Charlie walk arm in arm Rob in cool clothes
sunglasses trying to look cool Charlie making a point
something

Rob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk
store window REFLECTION

ROB (VO)
We went out for two years and for
every single minute I felt as though
I was standing on a dangerously narrow
ledge I couldnt get comfortable
couldnt ever stretch out and relax
Why would a girl -- no a woman --
like Charlie go out with someone who
only a few years ago sewed a Foghat
patch on his jacket I felt like
all those people who suddenly shaved
their heads and said theyd always
been punks I felt like a fraud
And I was depressed by the lack of
flamboyance in my wardrobe

INT CHARLIES APARTMENT - DAY

The fabulous sophomore design students studio

White wood floor white walls overvarnished door
print on the wall futon on the floor Rob lies back
elbows watching Charlie in uncomfortable worried awe

stands her back to him wearing only her underwear and
pulling on a T-shirt -- a heartbreaking image to look

on

Il worried about my abilities as a
lover I was intimidated by the
ambivalence

She left me for one of them The
dreaded Marco
EXT CHARLIES APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is RAINING like crazy and Rob is shouting up at a
window maniacally gesturing The curtains part and
figure appears clad only in a sheet Next to her is a
built handsome man MARCO also in a sheet
Eventually he falls to his knees with a splash and
his head in his hands The light goes out
ROB (VO)
And I lost it I lost it all
Dignity faith fifteen pounds

INT SOME RECORD STORE - DAY
A younger and catatonic Rob listlessly sorts through a

ROB (VO)
I came to three months later and to
my surprise had flunked out of school
and started working in a record store

INT ROBS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob stands in front of his wall of music shifting LPs
between the shelves and piles
to
us

on the floor as he talks

ROB
What I really learned from the Charlie
Debacle is that you gotta punch your
weight Charlie was out of my Class
too pretty too smart too witty
too much What am I Average A
middleweight Not the smartest guy
in the world but certainly not the
dumbest Ive read books like The
Unbearable Lightness of Being
Angelas Ashes and Love in the Time
of Cholera and understood them I
think -- theyre about girls right --
just kidding -- but I dont like
them very much My all time top
five favorite books are Johnny Cashs
autobiography Snow Crash by Neil
Stevenson Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance The Trouser
Press Guides to Rock and I dont
know probably something by Kurt
Vonnegut I look through the New
Yorker when my neighbors done with
it and Im not averse to going down
to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles
films although on the whole I prefer
American films Top five being Blade
Runner Cool Hand Luke the first
two Godfathers which well count as
one Taxi Driver and The Shining
Im okay looking average height
not skinny not fat My genius if
I can call it that is to combine a
whole load of averageness into one
compact frame You might say there
were millions like me but there
arent really Alot of guys have
impeccable music taste but dont
read alot of guys read but are really
fat alot of guys are sympathetic to
women but have stupid beards alot
of guys have a Woody Allen sense of
humor but look like Woody Allen
Some drink too much some drive like
assholes some get into fights or
show off money or do drugs I dont
do any of these things really If
I do okay with women its not because

of the virtues I have but because
of the ugly flaws I dont have
So Charlie and I didnt match
After her I was determined to never
get out of my league again

INT ROBS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rob presses play on the answering machine A pleasant

older
female voice is heard Its JANET Lauras mother
JANET

little rough today and I thought
hed like to talk to you No big
deal I love you two Bye
Beep

Rob its Liz Just calling to see
well if youre okay Give me a
ring Im not taking sides Yet
Lots of love Bye
He pulls an LP from a shelf puts it on the turntable
and
sits back in his chair
EXT LAKE MICHIGAN WATERFRONT - MOS - THE PAST
The MUSIC becomes SOUNDTRACK to the following scenes
Rob
and SARAH a thin modestly attractive young woman
SARAH
walk and talk They seem to be emphatically
complaining

together

ROB (VO)

Charlie and I didnt match Marco
and Charlie matched Me and Sarah
number four on the all time break-
ups list matched She wore more or
less the same clothes as mine had
an acceptable working knowledge of
music and she had been dumped by
some asshole named Michael He was
her moment Charlie was mine Sarah
had sworn off men I had sworn off
women It made sense to pool our
loathing of the opposite sex swear
them off together and get to share
a bed with someone at the same time

INT SARAHS APARTMENT - MOS - NIGHT

Rob and SARAH sit up in bed staring at the
television

ROB (VO)
We were frightened of being left
alone for the rest of our lives
Only people of a certain disposition
are frightened of being alone for
the rest of their lives at twenty-
six We were of that disposition
Everything seemed much later than it
was

INT SARAHS KITCHEN - MOS - DAY ROBS POV
of Sarah sitting across the table mid-confession

ROB (VO)
When she told me that she met someone
else it made no sense Her meeting
someone else was contrary to the
whole spirit of our arrangement
All we really had in common was that
we were dumped by people and that
we were against dumping We were
violently anti-dump So how come I
got dumped

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

The MUSIC becomes PRESENCE again and Rob takes the
needle
off the record

ROB
You run the risk of losing anyone
who is worth spending time with
But I didnt know that at the time
All I saw was that Id moved down a
division and that it still hadnt
worked out and this seemed cause
for a great deal of misery and self-
pity And thats when Laura came
along
INT ROBS APARTMENT - NIGHT
Rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor
looks to camera

ROB
Im reorganizing my records tonight
Its something I do in times of
emotional distress When Laura was
here I had them in alphabetical order
before that chronologically
Tonight though Im trying to put
them in the order in which I bought
them That way I can write my own
autobiography without picking up a
pen Pull them all off the shelves
look for Revolver and go from there
Ill be able to see how I got from
Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty-
five moves What I really like about
my new system is that it makes me
more complicated than I am To find
anything you have to be me or at
the very least a doctor in Rob-ology
If you wanna find Landslide by
Fleetwood Mac you have to know that
I bought it for someone in the fall
of 1983 and then didnt give it to
them for personal reasons But you
dont know any of that do you You
would have to ask me to--

The phone rings again Rob picks it up

ROB
Yeah

MOM

Rob deflates a bit

ROB

Rob hangs up the phone He fills up his glass again
a swig and slumps into a chair If there was any wind
in Rob it just got knocked out After a moment he

EXT LOUNGE AX CLUB - LINCOLN AVE - NIGHT

Rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to
the club From inside he hears a GUITAR playing a
that becomes familiar not only to Rob but to us When
strong lilting female VOICE begins to sing we hear
is Baby I Love Your Way by Peter Frampton

Rob smiles at first but begins to darken as the verse
continues He steps out of line and leans against the

wall listening Is he beginning to cry Yes he

He looks around self-consciously and paces a bit
whether or not to stay He takes a deep breath and
in the door
INT LOUNGE AX - NIGHT
As Rob enters he looks to the stage where MARIE
standing alone with her acoustic guitar heading toward
songs finish Robs expression begins to shift from
melancholy to something else altogether Marie is

and Marie has touched his heart Rob navigates toward

though the small crowd as if pulled by something

addresses us over his shoulder

ROB
Sentimental music makes you nostalgic
and hopeful at the same time Maries
the hopeful part Lauras the
nostalgia part These things happen
They happen to men at any rate
This is why I shouldnt be listening
to pop music

As he gets closer to the stage --

DICK

Rob looks over to see Dick sitting with Barry a few
away He shakes it off and sits with them extending a
meaningful hand to Barry who takes it They turn back

to
the stage as Marie finishes the song
ROB
I always hated this song
DICK
Yeah
BARRY

ROB
But now I kind of like it
Dick and Barry nod then keep watching All three of
them
are in their own private fantasies with Marie
DICK

Dick and Barry wait nervously to buy a tape Rob just

ROB
Uh yes I like do Its simple
You make the tracks -- recording
studio -- deliver them to the pressing
plant where a master is cut the
master is then dubbed to submasters
which are the mothers as their
called for each press in the plant
You press the CDs or records put

in your cover art and thats it

But dont you remember

LAURA
I remember the song I just couldnt
remember who sang it

Rob shakes his head in disbelief

Silence

LAURA
I can see why you prefer Gaye to
Garfunkel I get it really But
there are so many other things to
worry about Theyre only records
and if one is better than the other
well who cares besides you and
Barry and Dick I mean really who
gives a flying fuck

ROB
You used to care more about things
like Marvin Gaye than you do now
When I first met you and I made you
that tape you loved it You said --
and I quote -- It was so good it
made you ashamed of your record
collection

LAURA
Well I liked you You were a deejay
and I thought you were hot and I
didnt have a boyfriend and I wanted

one

ROB
So you werent interested in music
at all

LAURA

Yeah sure More so then than I am

The car slows and Laura parks

ROB
But Laura thats me Thats all

She gets out of the car Rob turns to camera speaking
quietly and urgently

ROB
Okay Number two The stuff I told
her about being unhappy in the

me into saying it We were having
this state of the union type
conversation and she said quite
Laura

at

laundry

bag

matter-of-factly that we were pretty
unhappy at the moment and did I
agree and I said yes and she asked
whether I ever thought about meeting
someone else So I asked her if she
ever thought about it and she said
of course so I admitted that I
daydream about it from time to time
Now I see that what we were really
talking about was her and Ian and
she suckered me into absolving her
It was a sneaky lawyers trick and
I fell for it because shes much
smarter than me

the store this evening I feel
terrible Rob This is really hard
you know

ROB
Good
(beat)
So Is it my job

LAURA
What Gimme a fucking break Is
that what you think That your not
big enough a deal for me Jesus
gimme a little credit Rob

ROB
I dont know Its one of the things
I thought of

LAURA
What were the others

ROB
Just the obvious stuff

LAURA
Whats the obvious stuff

ROB
I dont know

She stands and walks toward the bathroom

LAURA
I guess its not that obvious then

ROB
No

As soon as she shuts the door behind her he turns to
camera

ROB
And number three The Pregnancy I
didnt know she was pregnant Of
course I didnt She hadnt told me
because I had told her I was sort
of seeing somebody else We
thought we were being very grown-up
but we were being preposterously
naive childish even to think that
one of us could fuck around and then
own up to it while we were living
together So -- I didnt find out
about it til way later We were
going through a good period and I
made a crack about having kids and
she burst into tears I made her
tell me what it was all about and
she did I felt guilty and so I got
angry She told me that at the time
I didnt look like a very good long-
term bet That it was a hard decision
and she didnt see any point in
consulting me about it When the
whole sorry tale comes out in a great
big --

We hear the bathroom door open

LAURA (0S)
What

ROB
(covering)
What what

Laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by
the
door

LAURA
Did you say something

ROB
No So Is it working out with
Tan

LAURA
Rob Dont be childish

ROB
Why is that childish Your living
with the guy Im just asking how
its going

LAURA
I am not living with him Ive just
been staying with him for a few days
until I work out what Im doing
Look this has nothing to do with
anyone else You know that dont
you I left because we werent
exactly getting along and we werent
talking about it And I suddenly
realized that I like my job and I
like what my life is could be turning
into and that Im getting to a point
where I want to get my shit together
and I cant really see that ever
happening with you and yeah yeah
I sort of get interested in someone
else and that went further than it
should have so it seemed like a
good time to go But I have no idea
what will happen with Ian in the
long run Probably nothing

ROB
Well then why dont you quit it while
you seem to not be ahead

Laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with
the
laundry bag Rob turns back to camera

ROB

-- When the whole sorry tale comes
out in a great big lump like that
even the most shortsighted jerk
even the most self-deluding and self
pitying of jilted wounded lovers
can see that there is some cause and
effect going on here that abortions
and Ian and money and affairs all
belong to all deserve each other
goes

topping

Laura reappears

to the book shelves next to the records

off the bag with books

LAURA
Look Maybe youll grow up and well
get it together you and me Maybe
Ill never see either of you again
I dont know All I know is that
its not a good time to be living
here

ROB
So what you havent definitely
decide to dump me Theres still a
chance well get back together

LAURA
I dont know

ROB
Well if you dont know theres a
chance right Its like if someone
was in the hospital and he was
seriously ill and the doctor said I
dont know if hes got a chance of
survival or not then that doesnt
mean the patients definitely going
to die now does it It means he
might live Even if its only a
remote possibility

LAURA
I suppose so

ROB
So we have a chance of getting back
together again

LAURA
Oh Rob shut up

ROB
Hey I just want to know where I
stand What chance --

LAURA
-- I dont fucking know what chance
you fucking have

her bag half-filled with clothes

and

She starts
She abandons her attempt at packing

ROB
Well if you could tell me roughly it
would help

LAURA

Okay okay we have a nine percent
chance of getting back together
Does that clarify the situation

ROB
Yeah Great

LAURA
(shaking her head)

Im too tired for this now I know
Im asking a lot but will you take
off for a while so I can get my stuff
packed up I need to be able to
think while I do it and I cant think
while youre here

ROB
No problem If I can ask one
question

LAURA
Fine One

ROB

It sounds stupid

LAURA
Nevermind

ROB
You wont like it

LAURA
Just ask it

ROB
Is it better

LAURA
Is what better Better than what

ROB
Well Sex I guess Is sex with
him better
LAURA
Jesus Christ Rob Is that really
whats bothering you

ROB
Of course it is

LAURA
You really think it would make a
difference either way

ROB
I dont know

LAURA
Well the answer is that I dont know
either We havent done it yet

ROB
Never

LAURA
I havent felt like it

ROB
But not even before when he was
living upstairs

LAURA
No I was living with you remember
Weve slept together but we havent
made love Not yet But Ill tell
you one thing The sleeping together
is better

ROB
(trying not to smile)
The sleeping together is better but
not the sex because you havent done
it was him yet

LAURA
Will you please just go

INT WEEDS BAR - NIGHT
Rob moves through the room still grinning a bit like a
proud
new father toward the table where Barry Dick Marie
and T-

Bone sit listening to a story T-Bone is telling
Marie turns to him

ROB
Hi Marie

MARIE

Rob glances at Barry who averts his gaze

ROB
She just wanted to pick up some stuff
No big thing A relief actually

MARIE

Rob glances at T-Bone his mind calculating the new

info
ROB
Is that why you came to Chicago in
the first place Because of you

collection and stuff
MARIE
Yup
Marie slides closer turning her back on the others
The
loop is closed
ROB
You share a place with T-Bone
MARIE
No way Id cramp his style And I
wouldnt want to listen to all that
stuff happening on the other side of
the bedroom wall Im way to
unattached for that
ROB
I understand completely
SERIES OF CUTS - ELAPSED TIME
Rob and Marie lean in to each other everyone else out
of

focus

ROB (VO)
Awhile back Dick and Barry and I
agreed that what really matters is
what you like not what you are
like

ROB AND MARIE - LATER

MARIE

ROB
What do you mean the Crumblers

ROB (VO)
References titles lyrics flew and

The evening goes with breathtaking
precision

INT MARIES APARTMENT - NIGHT
Rob and Marie are kissing standing up

MARIE

MARIE
Tops off two whiskeys and starts
into the other room where she sees
Rob standing and holding his jacket

ROB
Id better go I gotta get up early

MARIE
When I said before that I hoped it

She plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table

MARIE
Id like it if you could stay the
night
ROB
(as if it is dawning
on him)

Oh right Alright

MARIE
Jesus so much for delicacy I pegged
you for a master of understatement
beating around the bush and all that
buzz

ROB
I use it but I dont understand it
when other people use it

MARIE
So youll stay

ROB
Yeah

MARIE
Good

Marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the
bedroom

Rob just stands there and the LIGHTING CHANGES

ROB

(to camera)
Over nine million men in this country
have slept with ten or more women
And do they all look like Richard
Gere Are they all as rich as Bill
Gates Charming as Oscar Wilde
Hell no Nothing to do with any of
that Maybe fifty or so have one or
more of these attributes but that
still leaves well about nine
million give or take fifty And
theyre just men Regular guys
Were just guys because I even I
am a member of this exclusive nine
million member club In fact Marie
is my seventeenth lover How does
he do it you ask He wears bad
sweaters hes grumpy hes broke
he hangs out with the Musical Moron
Twins and he gets to go to bed with
a recording artist who looks like
Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan Whats
going on Listen up because I think
I can explain with all modesty aside
I ask questions Thats it Thats
my secret It works precisely because
that isnt how youre supposed to do
it if you listen to the collective
male wisdom There are still enough
old-style big-mouthed egomaniacs

running around to make someone like
me appear to be refreshingly
different If you cant hack this
simple strategy there are some women
out there of course who want to

get pushed around ignored and mowed
over but do you really want to be
with them anyway

he goes through a door into the bedroom Marie is
taking
off her earrings

ROB
Would you like me to turn the lights
out Or would you like them on

MARIE
God you ask a lot of questions

INT MARIES BEDROOM - MORNING

PENNY
Rob I was crazy about you I wanted
to sleep with you one day but not
when I was sixteen When you broke
up with me -- when you broke up with
me -- because I was to use your
charming expression tight I cried
and cried and I hated you And then
but

a bit

that little shitbag asked me out
and I was too tired to fight him
off and it wasnt rape because I
said okay but it wasnt far off
And I didnt have sex with anyone
else until after college because I
hated it so much And now you want
to have a chat about rejection
Well fuck you Rob

Penny stands and leaves Rob just sits

ROB

(cheerful)
So thats another one I dont have
to worry about I should have done

this years ago

looking
for
ROB
Well probably seemed like a good
idea at the time
She looks up again
SARAH
Probably I cant remember why

I havent got the heart for the
rejection conversation There are
no hard feelings here and I am glad
that she ditched me and not the
other way around

walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he
talks

ROB
I couldve ended up having sex back
there And what better way to
exorcize rejection demons than to
screw the person who rejected you
right But you wouldnt be sleeping
with a person Youd be sleeping
with a whole sad single-person
culture Itd be like sleeping with
Talia Shire in Rocky if you werent

She has come to assume such an

machine in the phone book I call
and hang up on her voice mail a couple
of times then I leave my name and

return your phone messages a decade
after she rejected you

IAN
Weve noticed and were glad But
you know how are we going to make

peace here We want to make things
easier for you What can we do
Obviously I know how special Laura

is and I know things cant be good

to see me anymore Id respect that
decision Do you see what Im saying

SERIES OF SHOTS OVER THE COURSE OF DINNER

Sexy version of a hip wine commercial a small mid-
crowd of successful beautiful people Rob sits at the
silently as the other guests talk and eat Robs
activities are working his way through maybe a few too
wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesnt get in
face His eyes occasionally dart around the table but

says nothing to anyone

INT CHARLIES LIVING ROOM - LATER

Rob is a little too settled into the couch somewhat

Everyone gone but the two of them Charlie plops down
chair across from Rob

ROB
Hey Charlie

CHARLIE
Hey Rob

ROB
Why did you break up with me for
Marco

CHARLIE
(on her feet)
Fuck I knew it Youre going
through one of those what-does-it-
all-mean things

ROB
Huh

CHARLIE
Theres been a rash of them recently
I find it a little unnerving In
fact Marco called a few months back
and he wanted to see me and rehash
the past as they say and I wasnt
really up for it Do all men go
through this

ROB
Cmon just answer the question
You can say what you like What the
hell

Charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling musters a
look
of contemplation

CHARLIE
Its all kind of lost in the in
the dense mists of time now It

wasnt that I really liked Marco
more In fact I thought you were
more shall we say attractive than
him It was just that he knew he

was good-looking and you didnt and
that made a difference somehow You
used to act as if I was weird for
wanting to spend time with you and
that got kind of beat if you know
what I mean Your self-image started

to rub off on me and I ended up
thinking that I was strange And I
knew that you were kind and
thoughtful you made me laugh and
I dug the way you got consumed by
things you loved and Marco seemed
a bit more I dont know glamorous
More sure of himself

(pause)
Less hard work because I felt like
I was dragging you around sort of

(pause)
A little sunnier Sparkier

(pause)
I dont know You know what people
are like at that age They make
very superficial judgements Do you
think thats superficial He was a
clown if its any consolation

ROB
Did you tell that to Marco when he
did his what-does-it-all-mean thing
with you

CHARLIE
Oh God no I didnt want to hurt
his feelings

CUT TO
ROB IN HIS CHAIR
Rob to camera

ROB
I wanted the works and I got it
None of Alison Ashworths fate none
of Sarahs rewriting of history and
no reminder that Id got all the
rejection stuff a little backward
like I did about Penny Just a
perfectly clear explanation of why
some people have it and some dont
All Ive learned from Charlie is
that maybe my one talent my genius
for being normal is a little
overrated

the browser racks over there

BARRY
How many tickets can I put you down

Yep I might have missed some stuff

here that I dont even notice them

ROB
Those look heavy Wheres Ian

LAURA
Hes at home Listen I cant believe

no right to do that and I told him

ROB
It was kind of funny

They smile

LAURA
Im sure

ROB
You still together Going all right

LAURA
I dont really want to talk about
it to be honest

ROB
That bad eh

LAURA
You know what I mean

Rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room

ROB
Its a dump isnt it

Laura sits down on the other side of the couch
LAURA
Fix it up Itll make you feel
better

ROB
Ill bet you cant remember what you
were doing here can you I mean
how much are you making now Sixty
Seventy And you were living in
this shitty place

LAURA
You know I didnt mind And its
not as if Rays place is any better

ROB

straight What is his fucking name
Ian or Ray What do you call him

LAURA
Ray I hate Ian

ROB
I hate him too So I just call him
Mavis Or Sissyboy Or Mavis
the Sissyboy

Laura starts laughing laying on the couch on her back
very

close to Rob Rob leans in sort of looking down into
her

eyes

ROB
This is where youre supposed to say
that you havent laughed this much
in ages and then you see the error
of your ways

LAURA
You make me laugh much more than Ray
does if thats what youre getting
at But I already knew you could
make me laugh Its everything else
I dont know about

ROB
You know Im a good person

LAURA
Mmm hmm

ROB
You know that I can cook my ass off
when I feel like it

LAURA
Oh ho so very infrequently

He moves a little closer

ROB
You know my favorite beverage is
your bath water

She laughs He moves in not really trying to kiss her
but

leaving the door open for her She almost goes for
it but

instead gets to her feet

LAURA
Time to go

She goes to her bags Rob points to a pile of CDs

ROB
Dont forget your CDs

LAURA
Those arent mine

ROB
Sure they are

LAURA

Theyre not really though are they
I know you bought them for me and
that was really sweet of you but
that was when you were trying to
turn me into you I cant take them
I know theyd just sit around staring
at me and Id feel embarrassed by
them and they dont fit in with
the rest of whats mine do you
understand That Sting record you
bought for me that was a present
for me I like Sting and you hate
him But the rest of this stuff

(bending down to the

pile)
Who the hell is Nick Lowe Or Gram
Parsons Or the Boredoms I dont
know these people I

ROB
Okay okay I get the picture

LAURA
Im sorry to go on about it But I
dont know theres a lesson here
somewhere and I want to make sure
you get it

ROB
I got it You like Sting but you
dont like Gram Parsons because
youve never heard of him

LAURA
Youre being deliberately obtuse

ROB
I guess I am

LAURA
Well think about it

She hefts the duffel bag opens the door and exits

ROB
Fuck
CUT TO
ROB IN HIS CHAIR
Rob to the camera
ROB

Whats the point in thinking about
it If I ever have another
relationship Ill buy her whoever
she is stuff that she oughta like
but doesnt know about -- thats

what new boyfriends are for And
hopefully I wont borrow money from
her or have an affair and she wont
need to have an abortion or run away
with the neighborhood and then there
wont be anything to think about
Laura didnt run off with Ian because
I bought her CDs she wasnt that
keen on and to pretend otherwise is
just just psychowank If she
thinks that then shes missing the
Brazilian rainforest for the twigs
If I cant buy the Plastic People of
the Universes first album for new
girlfriends then I might as well
give up because Im not sure I know
how to do anything else

He nods offstage and a muffled mechanical noise is

The coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath

A low baleful human HOWL is heard starting quietly
gaining in volume

ROB (VO)
I hear something in Lauras voice
her
through

him

furniture
but

Rob

but I know what it is and at that
moment I want to go to her and offer
to become a different person to
remove all trace of what is me as

LIZ
Maybe Ive been a little unfair
But is this really the time

ROB

So darkened by weather that it is almost night raining
torrents and big sheets Rob emerges from the front

Lauras parents house and begins walking down the
hands thrust into his pockets The rain almost

soaks him

EXT ANOTHER STREET

In the distance Rob runs toward us As he gets to us
move with him down the street He is drenched We
rain and his ragged breath Headlights appear behind
and backlight him getting brighter as the sound of an

gets louder Rob takes a look over his shoulder looks
desperately left and right and vaults himself over a

brick wall and into a flower bed landing on his back
black wet earth

The big drops of rain splash mud on his face and he
deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back panting
staring up at the sky Off-camera the car engine

up and a door opens and shuts He sighs and shuts his
eyes

He opens his eyes again to see Lauras face wet as

staring down at him It is difficult to distinguish
from tears
LAURA
Are you going to lie in that flower
bed all night

ROB
Uh No

But Rob keeps lying there Laura pulls herself to a

sitting
position on the wall just above him
LAURA
Youre soaking
ROB
Mmnn
LAURA
Youre also an idiot
Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the
wall

next to her

ROB
I can see why you say that Look
Im sorry I really am The last

thing I wanted was thats why I
left because I lost it and I
didnt want to blow my top in there
and look the reason I fucked

everything up was because I was
scared I just wanted you to know

thats all

LAURA
Thank you I appreciate it I cant
reciprocate

ROB

What do you mean

LAURA
I didnt mess things up because I
was scared I slept with Ray because
I was sick of you And I needed
something to snap me out of it

ROB
Sure I understand Look I dont
want to take up any more of your
time You get back and Ill wait
here for a bus

LAURA
I dont want to go back

ROB
What do you want to do

They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Lauras

INT LAURAS CAR - NIGHT

They drive sort of aimlessly through Lauras old
neighborhood

Laura sees something on her left and makes a sudden
turn up

a narrow road through some overgrown trees They come
toa

stop in a formerly paved clearing looking out ona
field

with an old abandoned school on the other side Laura
shuts

down the engine

ROB
When are you going back

LAURA
I dont know Sometime Later
Listen Rob would you have sex with
me

ROB

LAURA
I want to feel something else than
this Its either that or I go home
and put my hand in the fire Unless
you want to stub cigarettes out on
my arm

ROB
Ive only got a couple left Im
saving them for later
LAURA
Itll have to be sex then

She pulls herself over him staddling him in the
passenger

seat and kissing his neck She pauses and regards him
from

above

LAURA
Hello It doesnt seem so long ago
that I looked at you from here

ROB
Hi

LAURA
I knew there was a reason I wore a
skirt today

Laura reaches down and unzips his pants as they keep
kissing

ROB

LAURA
Oh Rob were not going to go through
that again

ROB
No no Its not are you still
on the pill

LAURA
Yes of course Theres nothing to
worry about

ROB
I didnt mean that I mean was

Laura looks at him motionless then begins to cry

ROB
Look we can do other things

LAURA
I lived with you You were my partner
just a few weeks ago and now youre
worried I might kill you and youre
entitled to worry Isnt that a
terrible thing Isnt that sad

She rolls off of him into her seat They sit there in
silence watching the rain run down the windshield

CuT TO
ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera

ROB
Later I wonder if I was really
worried about where Ian has been I
have no idea where hes been and
that gives me every right to insist
on protection But in truth it was
the power that interested me more
than the fear I wanted to hurt
her on this day of all days just
because its the first time since
shes left that Ive been able to

INT BAR - LATER

Rob and Laura lean back in a booth facing each other
We

get that feeling that not another word has been spoken
since

we last saw them

ROB

LAURA
Im too tired not to go out with
you
Rob leans forward
ROB

So if you had a bit more energy wed
stay split But things being how

(nodding)
Everythings too hard Maybe another
time I would have the guts to be on
my own but not now I dont
CUT TO

CUT TO

ROB
What about Ian

LAURA
Rays a disaster I dont know what
that was all about except that
sometimes you need someone to lob
into the middle of a bad relationship
like a hand grenade I guess and
blow it all apart

ROB
Mission accomplished

LAURA
I know its not very romantic but
there will be romance again at some
stage Im sure I just I need
you Rob Thats it And we know
each other and we care for each other

laugh

EXT LAKEFRONT - TWILIGHT
Rob and Laura walk the cement breakfront

LAURA
Like Mexico Or Jamaica Or
New York even

ROB
Hey great idea What Ill do is
tomorrow Ill get a hold of a box
full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on
the Sub label and Ill pay for it
that way

LAURA
Ill pay for you Even though you
owe me money We have to do something
with the money I earn I need to
I deserve it You can just think of
it as winning the lottery
ROB
Fantastic The Girlfriend Lottery

LAURA
Money does not matter I do not
care how much you earn Id just
like you to be a little happier in
your work but beyond that you can
do what you like

ROB
But it wasnt supposed to be like
this When I met you we were the
same people and now were not and

LAURA
How How were we the same people

ROB
Well you were the kind of person
who came to the Artful Dodger and I
was the kind of person who deejayed
at the Artful Dodger You wore jeans
and T-shirts and so did I And I
still do and you dont

LAURA
Because Im not allowed to I still
do after work So what Should
we just break up Is that what youre
saying Because if you are Im
going to run out of patience

ROB
No but

LAURA
But what

ROB

But why doesnt it matter that were
not the same people we used to be

LAURA
You havent changed so much as a
pair of socks in the years Ive known
you If weve grown apart then Im
the one whos done the growing and
all Ive done is change jobs

ROB
And hairstyles and clothes and
attitude and friends and

LAURA
I cant go to work with my hair dyed
pink And I can afford to go shopping
more now and Ive met a couple people
I like over the last year or so

ROB
Youre tougher

LAURA
More confident maybe

ROB
Harder

LAURA
Less neurotic Are you intending to
stay the same for the rest of your
life

ROB
Im alright

LAURA
Yeah youre alright But youre
certainly not happy So what happens
if you get happy And yes I know
thats the title of an Elvis Costello
album I use the reference
deliberately to catch your attention
Should we split up because Im used
to you being miserable What happens
if you I dont know start youre
own record label and its a success
Time for a new girlfriend

ROB
Youre being stupid

LAURA
How What would be the difference
between you having a record label
and me going from legal aid to private
practice

Rob is silent

Oh hi
LAURA

BARRY
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street

LAURA
What are you talking about

BARRY
Just that Rob seems to think it would
be wiser to start a record label by
putting out a record with business-—
crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters
than with someone he knows in his
bitter jealous heart is a musical
visionary Thats all

Laura puts it together and smiles She goes to the
back
and crack the door finding Rob sitting on a box
thinking
ROB

with Paul and Miranda -- with what
they have and the way they treat
each other and the way they make me
feel as if Im the new center of
their world I think theyre great

every week for the rest of my life
Only right at the end of the evening

trick

LAURA
I tricked you into meeting some people

it would be fun to introduce you to
someone with a Tina Turner album and
then see whether you still felt the
same way

She moves to Rob and wraps her arms around him They
look

deeply at each other She breaks away from him and
walks

LAURA
Just local of course

ROB
And the triumphant return of DJ Rob
Gordon Triumphant Return

LAURA
I had that idea when I was living

Sonic Death Monkey

BARRY

ROB
Barry youre over thirty years old
You owe it to yourself and your
friends and to your parents not to

Monkey

BARRY
I owe it to myself to go right to
the edge Rob and this group does
exactly that Over the edge in
fact

ROB

BARRY
Thats what we want Reaction And

CuT TO
INT ROB AND LAURAS APARTMENT - DAY

Rob and Laura

LAURA
Theyll go on early Nobody will
even be there yet and I told them
they cant play for more than a half
hour

ROB
Its no joke Im responsible for
what happens you know Embarrassment
aside theres a lot of money and
effort in this at least by my
standards I have to put down a
deposit for the room I have to pay
the pressing plant for the records
sleeve them sticker them --

LAURA
We took care of that

Robs brow furrows

LAURA
Barry and Dick and me Look in the
bedroom

Rob goes to the bedroom door and opens it Its sort
of

like Christmas hundreds of Kinky Wizards CD singles

painstakingly packaged and stacked on the bed

CUT TO

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera

ROB
I suddenly feel choked up Its not
the money its the way shes thought
of everything one morning I woke up
to find her going through my records
pulling out things that she remembered
me playing when I deejayed and putting
them into the little carrying cases
that I used to use and put away in a
closet somewhere years ago She

knew I needed a kick in the ass

She also knew how happy I was when I
used to deejay From which every
angle I examine it it still looks

as though shes done all of this
because she loves me

CUT BACK TO
INT ROB AND LAURAS APARTMENT

Rob turns from the bedroom and goes to Laura putting
his
arms around her

ROB
m sorry Ive been acting like a
jerk I do appreciate what youve
done for me and I know youve done
it for the best possible reasons
and I do love you even though I act
like I dont

LAURA
Thats okay You seem pissed off
all the time though

ROB
know I dont get it

CUT TO

ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera

ROB
But if I had to take a wild guess
Id say that Im pissed because I
know Im stuck with Laura bound to
her and I dont like it That dreamy
anticipation you have when youre
fifteen or twenty or thirty even
that the most perfect person in the
world might walk into your store or
office or friends party at any
moment Thats all gone I think
and thats enough to piss anybody
off Laura is who I am now and
its no good pretending otherwise

CuT TO
INT RECORD STORE - DAY

Rob is standing shelves A very pretty young woman
CAROLINE
comes through the door and looks around She sees Rob

CAROLINE
Excuse me

Rob looks up and takes her in like a dish in a window

ROB
May I help you

CAROLINE
Im looking for Deejay Rob Gordon

ROB
Uh Thats me

CAROLINE
Im Caroline Fortis from The Reader
I want to do a story on you

ROB
Right Why

CAROLINE
Well I used to go to the Dodger on
your nights and I saw youre doing
it again and that your putting out a
record and its sort of a then-and-
now story against the backdrop of
the Chicago music scene with the
emphasis on now

ROB
Oh Okay

CAROLINE
I thought I would ask you a few
questions if thats okay

ROB
Huh You used to come to the club
and

in

I shouldnt have let you in You
must have only been about sixteen

Rob realizes what he must be sounding like He blushes

retreats

Rob looks

the store

He winces

ROB
What I mean is I didnt mean you
look young You dont You dont
look old either You look just as
old as you are A bit younger maybe
but not a lot Not much Just right

CAROLINE
So Is now a good time

around there is absolutely nothing going on
He nods She pulls out a pad and pencil

CAROLINE
Right So You must have an enormous
record collection

ROB
Yeah I could show it to you if you
want to come over and see it

immediately

CAROLINE
Yeah well Lets see What are
youre all-time top five records

ROB
Pardon me

CAROLINE
Your desert island top-five

ROB
Oh boy In the club or at home

CAROLINE
Is there a difference

ROB
(a little too shrill)
OF COURSE Well yeah a bit Sin
City by the Flying Burrito Brothers
is an all-time top five but I
wouldnt play it at the club Its
a country-rock ballad Everybodyd

go home
CAROLINE

Nevermind Any five So four more
ROB

What do you mean four more

CAROLINE
Well if one of them is this Sin
City thing --

ROB
Can I go home and work this out and
let you know In a week or so

CAROLINE
Look if you cant think of anything
it doesnt matter Ill do one My
five favorite from the old days at
the Dodger

Rob is aghast humiliated quietly outraged

ROB
Oh Im sure I can manage something
Sin City New Rose by The Damned

Hit It and Quit It by Funkadelic
Shipbuilding Elvis Costello
Japanese import no horns or

different horns anyway um
Mystery Train by Elvis Presley
And Spaced Cowboy by Sly and

the Family Stone A bit
controversial I know but

CAROLINE
Fine Thats great

ROB
Is that it

CAROLINE
Well I wouldnt mind a quick chat
if you got the time

ROB
Sure but is that it for the list

CAROLINE
Thats five So Why did you decide
to deejay again

ROB
Well it was a friends idea really
and the record release party seemed
like a good place to do it So
(looking over her pad
at the list)
I should really put a James Brown in

there --

CAROLINE
Nice friend

ROB
Yeah

CAROLINE

Whats his name

ROB
Who Oh My friend My friend is
Laura A girl A friend whos a
girl

CAROLINE
Music for Old People What does
that mean

ROB
Look Im sorry about this but Id
like the Upsetter by Lee Scratch
Perry in there Instead of Sin
City

She scribbles and writes

CAROLINE
Okay Dance Music For Old People

ROB
Oh you know a lot of people arent
too old for clubs but theyre too
old for acid jazz and garage and
ambient and all that They want to
hear old funk and Stax and New Wave
and Old School Hip Hop and some new
stuff all together and theres nowhere
for them

CAROLINE
And the new label And the Kinky
Wizards

ROB
Oh well the Kinky Wizards are --
you know what Why dont I just
make you a tape

CAROLINE
Would you Really Wow I could
have deejay Rob Gordon play in my
own home

ROB
Haha Right Its no problem I
love making tapes

CUT TO
ROB IN HIS CHAIR
Rob to camera

ROB
A good compilation tape like breaking
up is hard to do and takes ages
longer than it might seem You gotta
kick off with a killer to hold the
attention Then you have to take it
up a notch but not blow your wad
so maybe cool it off a notch and
you cant put the same artist twice
on the tape except if some subtle
point or lesson or theme involved
and even then not the two of them in
a row and you cant woo somebody
with Joni Mitchells Big Yellow
Taxi and then bash their head off
with something like GBHs City Baby
Attacked by Rats and oh there
are a lot of rules Anyway I worked
hard at this one

INT ROB AND LAURAS APARTMENT - DAY

Rob sits Indian-style on the floor in front of the
stereo

He has a pad of paper with scrawled titles and cross-
outs
and is surrounded by piles of CDs and records

Laura turns and walks out of the room

INT RECORD STORE - DAY

you like to have a drink

CuT TO
ROB IN HIS CHAIR

Rob to camera

ROB
How are you not going to fall for
someone who wants to interview you
Now Caroline is all I can think about
And in the daydreams imagine every
detail the entire story of our future
relationship until suddenly I realize
that theres nothing left to actually
like happen Ive done it all
lived through it all in my head I
know the whole plot the ending and
the good parts Now Id have to
watch it all over again in real time
and wheres the fun in that And
fucking--when is it all going to
stop Am I going to jump from rock

to rock for the rest of my life until
there arent any rocks left Am I
going to bolt every time I get itchy
feet Because I get them about once
a quarter along with the stores
tax bill ve been thinking with
my guts since I was fourteen years
old and frankly speaking Ive come
to the conclusion that my guts have
shit for brains You know whats
wrong with Laura what my problem
is Whats wrong with Laura is that
Ill never see her for the first or
second or third time Thats all
Fuck it Ill probably mail the
tape Probably
