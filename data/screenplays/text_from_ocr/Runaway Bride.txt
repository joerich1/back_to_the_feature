RUNAWAY BRIDE

Screenplay by Sarah Parriott and Josann McGibbon

FADE IN
EXT AN IMPOSSIBLE EXPANSE OF MARYLAND FARMLAND - DAY

The wind rustles the endless field of corn blows over the
freshly mown meadow of soybeans and magically sways a copse of
trees

Its a Fall after-noon A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES

breaks the peace and A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows
of corn into the meadow They are running for their lives

CLOSE ON

The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a
disheveled wedding gown its train tattered and flying like a
knights banner out behind her This is MAGGIE CARPENTER

The horse is frothing and wild-eyed like the bride who turns
to look behind her in terror The horses labored breathing
mingles with Maggies panicked gasps

We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders
on Maggie clings to the reins She looks as though she is
running from the devil himself

Ike enters the bar The Woman drops the shirt she was holding
and walks off with her children The T-shirt Vendor goes back
to selling his shirts

INT NEW YORK BAR - LATE DAY

Ike sits at the bar speaking to an attractive Woman nearby a
MAN puts is USA Today on the bar and addresses the BARTENDER

MAN
I see photos of a lot of dead writers
on these walls Got any living ones

I have a story to tell that could win
one of them a Pulitzer

(then with enthusiasm)
Picture this if you will A small
town in Maryland a sleepy little
village within that a hardware store

The Man continues speaking as Ike and the woman continue their
conversation

WOMAN
So whats in store for us in tomorrows
column

IKE
I dont know yet Im kind of a last-
minute man Ideas dont flow until an
hour or two before deadline

The Woman gets up and begins throwing darts

WOMAN
(interrupting)
This is very interesting You get your
ideas for your column from life You
start up a conversation with a woman in
a bar attack her choice of reading
material try and get a rise out of her
while you contemplate whether or not
shes worth hitting on

IKE
No I cant hit on you until I get an
idea

She starts throwing darts

WOMAN
Thats flattering

IKE
No you dont understand

The Woman goes to her bar stool gathering her bag and leaves a
tip for the Bartender

WOMAN
I think I do understand So my not
responding to your baiting me will
inspire one of those potential bitter
diatribes you love to write about women
and all the things we do to drive men
crazy

IKE
(taken aback)
I dont write bitter diatribes about
women very often

She whacks him with a newspaper then shakes his hand

WOMAN
Only when the ideas arent flowing
huh Well it was very nice to meet
you one-minute man

The Woman leaves the bar

IKE
(as she exits)
Thats last minute man
(then louder)
And its the quality that counts

BARTENDER
You know for a good looking man you
strike out a lot

MAN
Ive seen much worse

The phone rings Te Bartender answers it as Ike sits back on
his bar stool Ike grabs the womans magazine that she left on
the bar and starts glancing at it The Man at the bar has heard
the whole thing

MAN (contd)
I said Ive seen much worse

Ike looks at the Man with reservation The Man is George
Swilling

IKE
Excuse me

MAN
The brush-off

Ike gets up and moves to the dart board He removes the darts

MAN (contd)
Ive witnessed far more treacherous and
nefarious exits than that At least
she castigated you in private

IKE
Not as private as I thought

Ike turns slightly giving the man his back

IKE (contd)
Kevin youve got some napkins

BARTENDER
Writing or wiping

IKE
Give me a pen

The Bartender gives him cocktail napkins and a pen Ike starts
making notes Ike looks up from his writing The Man gets up
and starts throwing darts

MAN
(throwing darts hard)
Ah come on They deserve it They
love you they hate you theyre hot
theyre cold theyre high theyre
low

IKE
Theyre up theyre down Its
really fun making this list with you
but Ive got a column to go write

BARTENDER
Ike

MAN
(undeterred)
But you dont have a really superb idea
Well theres a girl from my hometown

Ike moves to the Bartender and pays him

BARTENDER
(to Man)
Excuse me we dont need any new ideas

MAN
She likes to dump grooms right at the
altar They call her The Runaway
Bride

Both Ike and Bartender turn and stare

MAN
She performed the travesty seven or
eight times Right at the altar she
turns around and runs like hell
Bolts

Ike turns and heads for the door The Man calls after him
getting up from his stool without stopping his enthusiastic
story

MAN (contd)
Adios Plows down the aisle knocking
old ladies out of her way like the
running of the bulls at Pamplona And
guess what

IKE
I give up

MAN
She has the next victim all lined up
Shes twirling another body on the
spit

Ike stops in his tracks He turns back around in spite of
himself

Imagine if you will a small town in
Maryland

IKE

(reading)
Today is a day of profound
introspection I have been accused
of using this column to direct bitter
diatribes at the opposite sex This
uncomfortable accusation has plunged me
into at least fifteen minutes of
serious reflection from which I have
emerged with the conclusion that yes
-- I traffic in female stereotypes

EXT USA TODAY OFFICE - DAY
FISHER walks through the main office reading the paper

FISHER
But how can one blame me when every
time I step out my front door I meet
fresh proof that the female archetypes
are alive and well Te mother the
virgin the whore the crone theyre
elbowing you in the subway stealing
your cabs and overwhelming you with
perfume in elevators

To be fair the man-eater isnt
exactly new In Ancient Greece this
fearsome female was known as Erinys
the devouring death goddess In India
she is Kali who likes to devour her

yoni devour his -- dot dot dot never
mind In Indonesia the bloody-jawed
man-eater is called Ragma

MRS PRESSMAN
Holy moly

The older one Mrs Pressman listens with a pained expression
as the younger one Peggy continues to read the column aloud
Neither one can believe what theyre reading

PEGGY

(reads)
What is unusual about Miss Carpenter
is that she likes to dress her men up
as grooms before she devours them She
has already disemboweled six in a row
by leaving them at the altar I
cant ready anymore

MRS PRESSMAN

(takes paper from

her reads)
And her ritual feast continues as she
prepares to make a sacrifice out of the
seventh fiance So all bets are on and
we hope that this boomerang bride isnt
honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers
because many predict that this girl is

out of there before the race before

Maggie steps behind the front counter of the store and takes the
account book out Her voice trails off as she sees the dour
expression on the faces of her friends

MAGGIE (contd)

Peggy nervously mentions the newspaper

PEGGY
(delicate)
So -- Mag -- youve seen this huh

rips into it looking for her letter She finds it A smile on

aloud paying no mind to Bob who is sticking her arms through

it onto Maggies shoulders

looks at his brightly colored hair

rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving
it the finishing touches Then he sees his defaced newspaper
clipping and all becomes clear He picks up the article and
shows it to everyone Ike does a slow burn

A CRASH coming from the nearby back room we hear loud muttering
in Spanish then out stumbles GILL CHAVEZ 34 wearing a grease-
stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt He grins triumphantly
worshipfully cradling a CASSETTE TAPE in his hands

GILL
Hey -- I found it

Maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth

Jerry to let me sit in on Ripple

He pulls out the cassette from its case Its broken The tape
is dangling from the cassette

Listen Gill -- Theres this reporter

whos ben making my life a living hell
If he comes by here dont talk to

(crosses to Gill)
Dont show him that picture of me

Suddenly a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead

MAGGIE (contd)
What was that

Maggie stops Gill from playing She shoots her ex an angry glare
and moves a lever on the shop wall With a HUM the car descends

GILL
We went to San Francisco twice
Remember one time we had a flat tire
Which picture

As the hydraulic lift slows the car is lowered revealing Ike
sitting in the drivers seat He has been enjoying the
photograph hes holding

IKE
(feigning shock)
Imagine Maggie Carpenter topless ina
public arena
(checks photo again)
And I see there was a chill in the air

Maggie swipes for the photo but Ike is faster at pulling it away

MAGGIE
Give me that

IKE
But the most interesting thing here is
that I dont see the rose tattoo that
Ive heard about on your back

Gill takes off his guitar and sets it down
GILL
Ike bet me fifty bucks you dont still

Maggie loved that thing And I could
really use fifty bucks

Maggie is conspicuously silent

Maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt
revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin No
tattoo

MAGGIE (contd)
(turning back around)
Satisfied

Gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this

GILL

GILL
(dismayed)

MAGGIE
(admitting)

Ike laughs Maggie looks at him with rage Gill dramatically
pulls down the front of his t-shirt

GILL
Look

pained Gill shows it to Ike Ike looks at the tattoo He
shakes his head at Maggie

IKE
(sincerely)
Look look man I think the man is
heartbroken

MAGGIE
He is not

Maggie moves the lever on the wall again sending Ike back up to
the ceiling in the car She grabs the photo from Ike and exits

GILL
I think I am

Gill grabs his guitar and sits

GILL (contd)
Hey Ike what would Jerry do

The hydraulic lift stops moving Ike leans out

PEGGY
For what reason Some personal
satisfaction

MAGGIE
Thats what he says but if he thinks

Cory dives in for third and makes it The crowd goes wild
Peggy yells and jumps in

PEGGY (contd)
Good job honey

But Maggies whoop sails out above it all Cory waves But not
at Peggy He directs his delight at Maggie who jumps up and
down by the dugout

Ike looks between Cory Maggie and finally Peggy Peggy jerks
her waving hand back down to her side and sits down Ike
pretends not to have noticed The two watch as Maggie and Cory
smile at each other

IKE
Its nice that theyre still friends

PEGGY
(looking at Maggie

yard Cory scores greeted by Maggie Ike and Peggy watch as
Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in
celebration of Corys play No looks at Peggy Ike keeps an
empathetic silence seeing that Peggy is truly hurt

PEGGY (contd)

Suddenly Peggy stands pushes past him and runs down the steps
Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggys exit Ike pulls
his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it

Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look walks up to him in the
bleachers and sits next to him

MAGGIE
Youve been here for three minutes
What did you do to her

IKE
You can turn that finger around

Ike does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly
at Cory Now Maggie sees what hes getting at

MAGGIE
(defensive)
You misinterpret everything Weve all

a chair looking shell-shocked surrounded by the post-its she
stole from Ikes room We see as she reads them Father two-
fisted drinker Peggy best friend but Peggy doesnt totally
trust Maggie Bob -- doesnt love him Overwhelmed she
finishes reading the last note leans back puts her feet up on

the table deep in the mood of the melancholy music

The CAMERA MOVES on the last note on the floor next to her chair

EXT MAIN STREETBEAUTY PARLOR - NEXT DAY
Its early morning Mrs Pressman hands Peggy a cup of coffee
to go Peggy walks to the beauty parlor unlocks the front door
and goes in

INT BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY

Peggy enters and starts about her opening duties She turns on
the lights and turns and sees her friend Maggie

MAGGIE
Do you think I flirt with Cory

Peggy stops in her track Maggie is sitting curled up in a salon
chair She looks like she hasnt slept

PEGGY
Good morning to you too You look good

MAGGIE
Thank you Do you think I flirt with
Cory

PEGGY
Yes

Maggie looks miserable

MAGGIE
I dont mean it

Peggy moves to the salon mirror near Maggie with her cup of
coffee

PEGGY
I know I think sometimes you just
sort of spaz-out with random excess
flirtation energy and it just lands on
anything male that moves

MAGGIE
On anything male that moves As
opposed to anything male that doesnt
move

Peggy pours her coffee out of its Styrofoam cup into a ceramic mug

PEGGY
Like certain kinds of coral

Peggy sits in the salon chair next to Maggie

MAGGIE
Im going to kill myself

PEGGY
Why
MAGGIE
Because you think Im all like Hey

man check me out

PEGGY

(friendly)
No I dont think youre like Im
charming and mysterious in a way that
even I dont understand and something
about me is crying out for protection
from a big man like you Very hard
to compete with Especially to us
married women who have lost our mystery

MAGGIE
But you havent lost your mystery
Youre very mysterious

PEGGY
No Im weird Weird and mysterious
are two different things

MAGGIE
But Im weird

PEGGY
No Youre quirky Quirky and weird
are two different things

MAGGIE
Peggy theres distinct possibility
that I might be profoundly and
irreversibly screwed up Despite that
I love you and I can promise that I
will no longer flirt with Cory and I
beg your forgiveness

Maggie looks ready to cry

PEGGY
Im not worried about you and Cory or
Cory and me or even that youre
irreversibly screwed up But Maggie
youve been like this since we were
kids And I think now that you are
aware of it and that it hurts peoples
feelings maybe its time to move on
with your life and commit to someone of
your own like Bob if hes the one

MAGGIE
I think youre right
(then)
Is there anything I can do to make it
up to you

PEGGY
Something that brings warmth to my heart
(pause)
Duckbill platypus

MAGGIE
Its only funny at Camp Birchwood at
three in the morning at a tick hunt
Its not anymore

Maggie makes her funny face Peggy doesnt laugh

PEGGY
Youre right Its not funny now
Maybe we both grew up

MAGGIE
Thanks Will you fix my hair

about to throw off the covers when Maggies voice breaks the
silence

MAGGIE
Freeze Hold on to those covers -- I
didnt come here to see Ike Junior

Maggie smiles cheerfully at Ike from the foot of the bed He
narrows his eyes at her

IKE
I take it the desk clerk is one of your
many admirers
MAGGIE
(deadpan)
How do I do it Im not that beautiful

Ike notices Maggie is holding two coffees

IKE
Coffee Now

Maggie hands it to him

MAGGIE
Youre welcome Your notes made
interesting bedtime reading -- if you

like trashy fiction Your observations
are distorted ungrounded an incomplete
You must be very proud

IKE
Im not a boastful man Whats your
point

Ike puts a shirt on as Maggie speaks

MAGGIE
My point is that one again youre
getting it all wrong That wont
improve your reputation any and its
not very flattering to me either So
Im going to give you a chance to write
the truth

IKE
Really

Maggie turns away from him as he dresses

MAGGIE
Ive decided to cooperate and let you
interview me
(beat)
For a thousand bucks

Ike clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on

MAGGIE (contd)
I want a big wedding and a killer dress
and for a grand I will answer all your
questions and let you follow me around

Ike takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses
them on and crosses to the window

puts
IKE
My magazine doesnt pay because for
stories Its not what you call ethical

MAGGIE
Oh but making up the facts as you go
along is ethical Actually I meant
you You probably got severance or
expenses or both Ill take your check
No credit cards

IKE
(to Maggie)
Youve seen the post-its Ive already
got more juicy material than I need
Why should I pay you dollar one

MAGGIE
Because I think youre writing on spec
and with a first person interview you
might actually sell that thing

Ike knows shes right

IKE
Too much

MAGGIE
Seven-fifty

IKE
Five hundred

MAGGIE
Six-fifty

IKE
Done

Scowling he writes out the check and hands it to her Maggie

IKE

INT MAGGIES LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER THAT DAY
Maggies showing Ike engagement rings

MAGGIE
Thats Brians He took me ut canoeing
on the lake and gave me the ring in a
velvet box

Ike snores Maggie hits him
MAGGIE (contd)
(defensive)

It was classic

Maggie hands Ike another ring This one is in the shape of a
Grateful Dead rose

MAGGIE (contd)
Gill Of course He proposed at the
tie-dye t-shirt stand at a Dead concert
It was very sweet until he hallucinated
that the drum set was a blood-sucking
space alien

IKE
Always a mood killer

MAGGIE
Still sweet

Maggie hands Ike a third ring Its in the shape of a butterfly
and studded with multi-color gems

MAGGIE (contd)
George He proposed at a butterfly
farm in St Thomas The ring was
inside a cocoon

IKE
(grimacing)
Its a little Silence of the Lambs
for me I cant believe you waited for
the wedding to run

MAGGIE
Hes an entomologist I thought it was
very unique

Now Maggie shows Ike the ring on her hand Its a gold 1 with
a diamond set into the number

MAGGIE (contd)
And here we are at Bob He proposed
during the seventh inning stretch

Ike touches her hand to examine the ring more closely Her
surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her
sentence

MAGGIE (contd)
At an Orioles game

She takes her hand down Ike steps away

IKE
Wait Dont tell me The scoreboard
lit up with Mary me Maggie

Ike picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch

MAGGIE
It was one of the most wonderful
moments of my life Cal Ripken even
applauded

IKE

(stopping)
Highly suspect

MAGGIE
What do you mean It was incredibly
romantic

IKE
Maybe its just me but -- if you got

to dress it up it doesnt ring true
Ike moves back to the couch

IKE (contd)

I think the most anybody can honestly
say is Look

(sits on the arm

of the couch)
I guarantee that well have tough
times I guarantee that at some point
one or both of us will want to get out
of this thing But I also guarantee
that if I dont ask you to be mine
Ill regret it for the rest of my life
Because I know in my heart -- youre
the only one for me

Maggie stares at Ike for a beat His words have taken a little
bit of her breath away She covers

MAGGIE
I like it

She moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits

MAGGIE (contd)
Id like it better on a scoreboard
(lightly)
Is that how you proposed when you asked
your wife to marry you

Ike is taken aback
MAGGIE (contd)

Dont look so surprised youve got
divorce written all over you
IKE
Im a work in progress

MAGGIE
So Is that what you said to her

IKE
No I think I said something eloquent
like So uh -- maybe we should ya
know What do you think

MAGGIE
Now thats romantic A proposal like
that and you didnt find eternal bliss
What went wrong

Ike takes a swallow of cappuccino

IKE
I dont know

MAGGIE
You dont know

IKE
No

MAGGIE
Maybe you should ask her some time
Ever thought of that

Ike is restless He stands up

IKE
Call me crazy but I believe that check

questions for a while

Ike puts down his cup of coffee gets his tape recorder and sits
close to Maggie

moment

MAGGIE
Is this dress for sale

MRS WHITTENMEYER
It just seems like an awful lot of
money to spend on one of your dresses
Maggie You only wear them for about
ten minutes
Ike watches with regret as Maggies child-like enthusiasm
drains away her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of
the shop owner Hes starting to see that its no always easy
being Maggie Theres a tremor in her voice

MAGGIE
Yeah thats a good point
(then sitting)

father minded spending so much money on
booze that nobody drank

We hear Grandma as through the hotel doors we see Maggie exit

comes inside the hotel where she finds Ike talking to Grandma
who is having tea with her friend NETTA

MAGGIE
Ike Hi Grandma
IKE

Gram here was going to give me the
skinny on why you run from marital
bliss

GRANDMA JULIA

Right cover your ears Netta Its
not that shes afraid of the wedding

Innocent girls are terrified of the
one-eyed snake

(getting into it)
Why when I was a virgin bride I took
a knitting needle with me into the bed

Ike winces

MAGGIE
Actually Grandma I charmed the one-
eyed snake awhile ago

GRANDMA JULIA

mistresses He wanted me to be a

Maggie nods

IKE (contd)
My mother wanted me to become a
musician 0 for two But at least
Im a journalist and we all know
journalism is literature in a hurry

EXT IKES CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Ike and Maggie stare forward Both seem in melancholy moods
Theyre beginning to sense theyre in trouble here Suddenly
the car falters and jerks It shows to a stop on the shoulder of
the road The car backfires and smokes

EXT IKES CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
Ike and Maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment

MAGGIE
Your filters clogged This takes
unleaded

IKE
Can you fix it

MAGGIE
First I have to find some tools I
need a half and a nine-six-tenth

IKE

(removing his glasses)
Of what

MAGGIE
(in amazement)
Wrenches My dads gonna love that one

Maggie slams the food closed

IKE
Kind of isolated

MAGGIE
Yeah Its kind of nice

An uncomfortable silent pause Ike breaks the moment

IKE
Theres one thing we New Yorkers know
how to do is hail a cab If theres no
cab we walk
Ike stares off down the road Maggie indicates a building in
the distance then turns off the car lights

MAGGIE
I can get some tools over there and
save the battery Theres one thing

we country girls know how to do is cut
across a field Its quicker

Maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station
sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle

He smiles and follows her into the field

MAGGIE (contd)
Be careful of snakes

IKE
Snakes Are you serious I dont like
snakes Ive never even seen a snake

He steps carefully into the field then hops gingerly toward Maggie
MOMENTS LATER
Maggie leads Ike through a cornfield

MAGGIE
Do you think theres only one right
person for everybody

Ike chooses his words carefully

IKE
No But I think attraction is too
often mistaken for rightness
Attraction is very misleading And if
its mutual its well terribly
distracting

MAGGIE
Yes it is And it doesnt mean
anything

Ike nods as they come to a wooden fence She puts her hand on
his shoulder Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a
boost over the top We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross
Maggies face at the initial contact Neither of them moves --
forward or back but the electricity is obvious

ANGLE ON Ike His conflicted feelings are apparent With
difficulty Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove

their hands

MAGGIE (contd)
(lightly)
I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence

They look at each other for a moment then

MAGGIE AND IKE
(breaking the
moment jokingly)

She climbs over the fence on her own and Ike follows

an old guy LIONEL whittling on a porch

ready for work He is on the phone to Ike

FISHER

Negative attention is attention

attention

IKE (V0O)
This is about her negative attention
not mine Did you get the
reimbursement for the dress yet

FISHER
(into phone)

A BAND plays for two hula dancers The Trouts had decorated it
as a little slice of Hawaii There are tiki lights numerous
rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of Hawaiian
statuary Strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling

It looks like a Hawaiian high school gym on prom night

Maggies family Mrs Trout and people weve already met and
more are here milling around wit tropical drinks garnished
with umbrellas Plastic leis abound and most people have
managed to find their old Hawaiian shirts

As we come in the hula dancers finish their applause and Mrs

start of the wedding by knocking on the door

INT CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

Immediately Cory and Dennis open the doors for her entrance
All the guests stand as Maggie enter the chapel smiling

MAGGIES POV

The aisle stretches before her into infinity Faces goggle at
her from every direction The tiny figure of Ike stands like a
beacon a long way off

NEW ANGLE

She plunges forward with a sped-up hesitation step

ANGLE ON

Ike rocks imperceptibly urging her on Peggy and Cindy make
little come on motions It seems to be working Maggie

looks and noises of encouragement

Maggie closer -- loving her willing her on

face Her face

A sigh now rises from the GUESTS as Maggie closes in on Ike He
smiles at her She smiles at him She is almost there Shes
there smiling at Ike The Pastor gestures to the guests to sit
down They do

ANGLE ON

Ike sneezes She looks down and imagines she sees the carpet
splitting apart And she bolts like a bat out of hell Ina
flurry of white she is halfway down the aisle before Ike knows
what hits him

ANGLE ON

Ike stands there dazed For a second Then she springs into
action charging after her

IKE
(yelling out)
Block the doors

Like a general he points to Dennis and Cory in the back and
sends them into action The doors shut in Maggies face But
shes a wild animal cornered She moves to the side The
TOWNSPEOPLE stand so Ike can hurry through the pew Ike climbs
on the pews towards her as GUEST crowd the aisle blocking his
path Like a gazelle she leaps to the side aisle and scampers
down and away Fisher gets on his cell phone Ike charges from
one of the full pews crosses the aisle and leaps across the pews
near the staircase to cut her off He grabs her veil and it
comes off in his hands Maggie disappears down the steps of the
church basement Ike fumble with the veil and jumps over the
railing landing on Dennis toe He follows down the stairs
after her Mrs Pressman and Walter exchange bet money

She gathers her dress and jumps in as Ike yells from window
then quickly climbs out onto the lawn as the truck starts to
pull away

Maggie looks back once tearful and regretful and disappears
inside the truck The truck races off

The PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their cameras on Ike en masse He is
enveloped by a barrage of bright lights

steps are looking around as Ike turns around the corner and
past the church

So what are you doing here

MAGGIE
I wanted to talk to you about why I run
or ride away from things

Ike moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony
window listening

IKE
(after sitting)
Does it matter

MAGGIE
I think so When I was walking down
the aisle I was walking toward
somebody who didnt have any idea who I
really was And it was only half the
other persons fault because I had
done everything to convince him that I
was exactly what he wanted So it was
good that I didnt go through with it
because it would have been a lie but

you -- you knew the real me
IKE

Yes I did
MAGGIE

I didnt And you being the one at the
end of the aisle didnt just fix that

Ike takes this in Shes reaching him -- but then the defenses
go back up He turns to her

IKE
No I couldnt fix anything
(as he gets up)
But I still ended up chasing a truck

Ike moves out to the balcony After a moment Maggie follows him

embarrassing deviously plotting
potentially but not certifiably
psychotic state And if you liked me

then I mean now I cant imagine
(crosses to him)

then she gets down on one knee

eyes with his hand

the rest of my life Because I know in

Ike takes her hands affectionately

IKE

MAGGIE

Ike looks into Maggies shining face and pauses He gets up and
motions with his hand for her to stay seated He goes inside and
