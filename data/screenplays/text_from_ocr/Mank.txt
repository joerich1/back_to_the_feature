collaborator he wished

FADE IN

EXT wmOJAVE DESERT - DAY 1

From a lanyard hangs a rustic sign reading NOHTH VERDE
RANCH The only sound is a distant WHINE the only movement
a boil of dust on the horizon As the WHINE rises to a
ROAR the boil of dust grows until it becomes a car that
flashes past the sign and sets the lanyard swinging No
sooner does it settle back down than a second car
following the first siams by and starts it waggling again

EXT VICTONVILLE BUNGALOW - DAY 2

The cars stop in front of a small sun-bleached house

SUPERImPOSE THE
LEGEND

The occupants of both cars get out The driver of the first
is JOHN HOUSEWAN a swart officious young man already
verging on middle age His passenger is RITA ALEXANDER a
crisp young woman with an air of quiet competence She
fails in step behind him as they walk to the bungaiow The
driver of the second car a CHAUFFEUR joins a NURSE in
carefully removing from its back seat a FIGURE whose bottom
haif is encased in a huge plaster cast Taking his arms on
either side they siowly heip him to the waiting bungalow
The cast figure reassuring them and himself

FIGURE iN CAST

INT VICTORVILLE BUNGALOW - DAY 5

Efficient HOUSEMAN fusses feeling for dust KITA opens
windows and turns on a fan The door siams open the NURSE
and CHAUFFEUR staggering through the frame with the FIGURE
IN THE CAST putting him to bed

ANGLE FAVORING HOUSEMAN
Approaching the FIGURE in bed The NUKSE piumps his piilow

HOUSEWAN

(wiping dust off hands)
Weil Ive hag them set you up out

HOUSEWAN

The figure in the cast struggles to get out of bed The
ladies scramble to stop him its futile The CHAUFFEUR

(to Chauffeur)

He sets it then leaves Houseman crosses to it

HOUSEWAN (CONTD)

HOUSHWAN presses a button and a hidden door springs open
revealing a dazzling array of miniature liquor bottles
aligned in a row

HOUSEWAN (CONTD)
Weil naturally youll do your
damndest to get at it By the time

is to say ninety days you should
be a world-class sprinter

Houseman snaps shut the cabinet

Once a castle on a hili now a
memory of what once was alone
in his unfinished already
decaying pieasure palace aloof

We see an OLD wAN in a robe
smoking a pipe sitting alone by
his pool discarded pages
scattered at his feet Narrator
an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing
empirevainly attempting to
Sway as he once did the
destinies of a nation which had
long since ceased to listen to him
- No u-had ceased to trust him

We see through the trees as an
AIDE pushes this OLD wAN in a
wheelchair across neatly groomed

crusading Socialist as
Californias political savior
Certainly not FDR Am I right
Rex

TUGWELL
Off the record The president says
the man bears watching Especially
now that Repubiicans seem bent on

Come now wank - Upton Sinclair as
Thomas Jefferson

MANK
No youre right wR Jefferson

ban oil monopolies the railroad
trusts or cleaned up the

provocateur

MANK
Because he provokes thought

THALBERG
You always side with the writer
Mank Poor souis surviving a
depression on five grand a week

MAYER
Commies

THALBERG
LbS not wrong

MANK
Irving youre a literate man You
know the difference between
Communism and Socialism In
Socialism everyone snares the
wealth In Communism everyone
Shares the poverty

THALBERG

regularly repair whenever there seems to be danger of an
Opening that will enabie me to escape

He was 55
