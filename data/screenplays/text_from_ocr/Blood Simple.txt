LANDSCAPES

An opening voice-over plays against dissolving Texas
landscapes--broad bare and lifeless

VOICE-OVER
The world is full of complainers
But the fact is nothing comes with
a guarantee I dont care if youre
the Pope of Rome President of the
United States or even Man of the
Year--something can always go wrong
And go ahead complain tell your
problems to your neighbor ask for
help--watch him fly Now in Russia
they got it mapped out so that
everyone pulls for everyone else--
thats the theory anyway But what
I know about is Texas

ROAD NIGHT
We are rushing down a rain-swept country road
the rhythmic swish of tires on wet asphalt

VOICE-OVER
And down here youre on your own

INT CAR NIGHT

We are looking at the backs of two people in the front
aman driving and a woman next to him

Their conversation will be punctuated by the occasional

of oncoming headlights and the roar of the car rushing

The windshield wipers wave a soporific beat The

is halting awkward
WOMAN
He gave me a little pearl-handled
38 for out first anniversary

The car behind them waiting patiently Rain drifts
past its headlights

MOTEL ROOM

Pulling back from RAY and ABBY in bed making love
The only light is from cars passing along the highway
Each sweeping light-by ends in black

The pullback ends in a wide shot of the motel room The
following the last car lingers

A telephone rings

SAME WIDE SHOT MORNING

Ray and Abby are asleep On a nightstand next to the
the telephone is ringing

BAR BACK OFFICE NIGHT

We are tracking past a man seated behind a wooden desk
towards an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph that has

been slapped down on the desktop
The picture is of Abby and Ray in bed together in the
room
VOICE

I know a place you can get that

framed
The voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose
on life in Texas and the Soviet Union opened the movie
We cut to him
He is settling himself into a chair facing the desk He
LOREN VISSER a large unshaven man in a misshapen
leisure suit
He smiles at the man behind the desk
JULIAN MARTY
Sits staring down at the photograph Behind him a

opens on the bar proper Country-western music filters
from the bar
Marty is not pleased

MARTY
What did you take these for

VISSER
What do you mean

He removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket

and
nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette
VISSER
dust doin my job
MARTY
You called me I knew they were there
so what do I need these for
VISSER
Well I dont know Call it a fringe
benefit
MARTY
How long did you watch her
VISSER
Most of the night
He lights his cigarette then slaps his lighter onto
the

desktop

It is silver engraved on the top with a lariat
spelling out

Loren in script and on the side with a declaration
that

he is Elks Man of the Year

VISSER
Theyd just rest a few minutes
and then get started again Quite
something

Marty stares down at the photograph

MARTY
You know in Greece they cut off the
head of the messenger who brought
bad news
A smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen

VISSER
Now that dont make much sense

MARTY
No It just made them feel better

Marty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk
Visser laughs as he watches Marty
VISSER
Well first off Julian I dont know
what the story is in Greece but in
this state we got very definite laws

about that

Marty hunched over the standing safe behind his desk

tosses
in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope
VISSER
Second place I aint a messenger
Im a private investigator And third
place--and most important--it aint
such bad news I mean you thought he
was a colored
(he laughs)
Youre always assumin the worst
Visser blows another smoke ring pushes a fat finger
through
the middle of it and beams at Marty
VISSER
Anything else
MARTY
Yeah dont come by here any more
If I need you again I know which
rock to turn over
Marty scales the pay envelope across the desk It hits
Visser

in the chest and bounces to the floor

Visser looks stonily down at the envelope no
expression for
a beat Then he roars with laughter
rises

to

and

CUT TO

and

the

VISSER
Thats good which rock to turn
over thats very good
Sighing he leans forward to pick up the envelope He
straightens his cowboy hat and walks over to a screen
letting out on the bars back parking lot
VISSER
Well gimme a call whenever you wanna
cut off my head
He pauses at the door cocks his head then turns back
the desk and picks up his cigarette lighter Returning

the door

VISSER
I can crawl around without it

The door slams shut behind him
Marty scowls at the back door After a moment he rises

crosses the office to the window looking out on the

Over Martys shoulder we see the long bar leading up to
window in perpendicular The camera is tracking

past Marty to frame on the window

A black man is just now vaulting the near end of the
over onto the customer side

mirrored on this side

MEURICE the black bartender is muscular about 200
pounds

dressed in white pants and a sleeveless T-shirt He is

buildings

A Motown song drops We track behind Meurice as he
makes his

way back toward the bar When he reaches it he claps a
couple

of people on the shoulder who make way for him He
vaults
back over the top walks down the bar and stops in

from of
an attractive white woman sitting on a bar stool and
sipping
a brandy
MEURICE

MARTY
(glaring)

Marty loses his glare and his gaze drifts over to the
woman

After an awkward pause Meurice clears his throat

MEURICE
-Marty Id like you to meet an
old friend of mine Debra Debra

She is unselfconsciously returning Martys stare

Marty laughs

MARTY

Martys attention is caught by something down the bar
He
half-rises from his stool

Marty tosses a beer nut into his mouth

MARTY
Tell him you have a headache

EXT BACK OF MARTYS BAR

Marty is sitting on the stoop that descends from his
office to a graveled back parking lot he is framed in
open doorway of his brightly lit office He stares

at something offscreen

MARTYS POV

In the middle distance a huge incinerator operates full
Orange flames lick out the sides white smoke billows
the top Two figures in silhouette are chucking garbage
through a large gate

BACK TO MARTY

Behind him in the office we see the door from the bar

and Ray entering

Marty looks over his shoulder then back toward the
furnace
Ray descends the stoop and stands in front of him

RAY

at the furnace)

Ray tenses There is a pause

Marty still stares at the furnace

MARTY
Then whatd you come here for

RAY
(no more conciliation)
You owe me for two weeks

Marty shakes his head
MARTY
Nope Shes an expensive piece of

ass

He finally looks up at Ray
MARTY
-You get a refund though if you
tell me who else shes been sluicing

RAY
I want that money If you wanna tell
me something fine--

MARTY
Whatre you a fucking marriage
counselor

Ray breaks into a strained half-smile
Marty grins humorlessly back mimicking Rays smile

MARTY

Whatre you smiling at--Im a funny
guy right Im an asshole No no
thats not whats funny Whats funny
is her Whats funny is that I had
you two followed because if it isnt
you shes been sleeping with someone
else

He grabs a knee in each hand and leans forward still

looking
at Ray He is becoming only slightly more animated
MARTY
Whats really going to be funny
is when she gives you that innocent
look and says Whatre you talking
about Ray I havent done anything
funny
He leans back again
MARTY
But the funniest thing to me right
now is that you think she came back
here for you--thats whats funny
Ray moves forward and Martys eyes follow him as he
approaches Martys smile abruptly turns to a look of
apprehension Ray enters frame and brushes past Marty
as he
walks up the stoop and crosses the back office toward
the

bar
Marty relaxes and his gaze returns to the furnace

MARTY
-Come on this property again and
Ill be forced to shoot you

Ray opens the door to the bar and shuts it softly

behind
him

INT EMPTY APARTMENT NIGHT
The apartment is dark We are looking across a shadowy
towards a large window through which cold blue street
shines Through the window we can see the facade of the
building across the street we are three or four floors
We can hear the animated accented voice of an Hispanic
approaching the apartment from the hallway behind us
LANDLADY (0S)

A crack of light shoots across the floor as we hear the
apartment door open behind us A figure enters frame

crosses into the shaft of light we see that it is Abby
moves across the dark apartment in silhouette against
window

The Landlady laughs cheerfully

The old man is now sitting on the edge of the bed
smoking a

Landlady
snaps at him again in Spanish and is again cheerful as

turns back to address Abby
LANDLADY

Abby enters and sits into an empty chair next to
ABBY

Looks like the state legislature is

out of session
Meurice continues to stare intently off

MEURICE
I thought this is where they met

All of the heads at the bar start to swivel including
Meurices A couple of patrons hurriedly snatch their

off the bar

In the extreme foreground a stripper dances on the top
the bar into frame We crop her just above her white
heeled cowboy boots and her bare calves

The conversation continues with Abby looking at

Meurice and everyone else at the bar looking up at a

ABBY

body
he slides the picture of Abbys and Rays corpses from
under
the envelope into the safe then withdraws two packets
of

money
MARTY
Dont be absurd I wasnt about to
tell anyone

He shuts the safe and spins the dial

MARTY
This is an illicit romance--weve
got to trust each other to be
discreet

He walks across the room and throws the money and the
envelope
down on the desk

MARTY
For richer for poorer

Visser looks from the money down at his hands They are
sweating

VISSER
Dont say that Your marriages dont
work out so hot

He wipes his hands on his pants

VISSER

Marty sits and props his booted feet up on the desk

know about it the better

He smiles

MARTY

He starts nervously pacing around the room looking for

RAY
Anyway we got some time now But

ABBY
Ray--

RAY
Abby never point a gun at anyone
unless youre gonna shoot him And
when you shoot him you better make
sure hes dead

Rays pacing is more agitated as he looks distractedly
the apartment

RAY
because if hes not dead hes
gonna get up and try and kill you

He pauses seemingly at a total loss

Thats the only thing they told
us in the service that was worth a
goddamn--Where the hells my

ABBY
What the hell happened Ray

Ray is walking to the window Sunlight streams in

to

his feet and then remains still

bartender who for want of a more compelling character
served

as our storys hero fled the scene of the tales

Adams apple stands behind the Formica check-in
counter

the

you for

I need a room
Calling out from the divan

He needs a room Dusty

plus sales tax plus extra for the

Ever durned one

RAY
(gamely)
Okay Ill take the TV option
RHODES
Well see the thing about that is
were booked
Looking at this scene now years later it strikes us
revising it out of existence as we did constituted
much rewriting Indeed the more prosaic scene we
it with involving Ray stopped at a traffic light can
found in the finished script but not in the finished
It was shot but then deleted in order to more quickly

the carnage which was the pictures raison d‘’etre
