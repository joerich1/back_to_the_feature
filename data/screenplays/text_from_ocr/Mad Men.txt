You werent worried about waking

DON

MIDGE
No only my work
She turns and Don follows her shapely form into the
apartment
INT MIDGES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 6

The apartment has a huge glass view of Manhattan and is
decorated in Swedish modern chrome teak and white In the
center of the room under a large mobile is a queen-size bed
on a platform

Midge walks to her drafting table where she is working Don
sits on the edge of the bed

MIDGE
Well youre lucky Im still up
working And that Im alone

DON
Hows it going

MIDGE
They invented something called
Grandmothers Day It ought to

keep me busy drawing puppies for a
few months

She holds up a few of the greeting cards that she has been
working on

DON
Can I run a few ideas past you

Midge smiles and heads to the bar to fix a couple of drinks
MIDGE
Does that mean what I think it
means Because Im familiar with
most of your ideas

Don starts leafing through his pockets pulling out napkins

This is the same scare you had five

testimonials no more cough-free

nicotine filter-tipped nothing

crush-proof box and Four Out of
Five Dead People Smoked Your
Brand

Don drains his drink Midge puts on a record She sits
behind him on the bed starts rubbing his neck

MIDGE
Is this the part where I say Don
Draper is the greatest ad-man ever
and his big strong brain will find
a way to lead the sheep to the
slaughterhouse

Don grabs her hands over his shoulders pulls her over and
kisses her on the lips lightly

DON
I dont want to go to school

EXT TOWERING MANHATTAN SKYSCRAPER - MORNING 8

From the air we see an elegant modern glass building
Below the hats on the tops of mens heads swarm like ants
through revolving doors

INT ELEVATOR 9

A middle-aged black man mans the controls of the crowded
elevator Three young execs KEN DICK and HARRY in
apparently identical suits take off their hats and crowd to
the back of the elevator

DICK
Twenty-three

HARRY
Oh but not right away

An attractive YOUNG SECRETARY holding her purse to her
chest steps on the elevator and turns her back to them The
three men look her over and nod to each other approvingly

KEN
(to the operator)
Pal can you take the long way up

The secretary looks down The operator says nothing Dick
slouches against the back wall

as if to stop them

drawing of a stripper on it is written The Slipper Room

INT STERLING COOPER HALLWAY -- LATER

Walking down a wide corridor with open offices on either side
is JOAN mid-twenties an incredibly put together office

A half step behind her carrying a cardboard box
with supplies is PEGGY OLSON who at 20 seems far younger

manager

JOAN

Now this is the Executive floor
It should be organized but its
not so youll find Account
Executives and Creative
Executives all mixed together

(laughing)
Please dont ask me the difference

PEGGY
Great

JOAN
Hopefully if you follow my lead
you can avoid some of the mistakes
I made here

Ken and Dick pass in the hallway

DICK
(as he passes)
Hello Joan

JOAN
(to Peggy re Dick)
Like that one So how many trains
did it take you

PEGGY
Only one but I got up very early

JOAN
In a couple of years with the
right moves youll be in the city
with the rest of us Of course if
you really make the right moves
youll be out in the country and
you wont be going to work at all

They push through a couple of double doors to another set of

offices with secretarial desks in front of them

to an empty desk

Joan points

JOAN (CONTD)
Youll be there just across the
aisle from me Well both take
care of Mr Draper for the time
being

Peggy sits down and starts unloading her things Joan stands
in front of her very business-like

JOAN (CONTD)
I dont know what your goals are
but dont over-do it with the
perfume Keep a fifth of something
in your desk Mr Draper drinks
rye Also invest in some aspirin
some band-aids and a needle and
thread

Peggy whips out a steno-pad and starts writing

PEGGY
Rye is Canadian right

JOAN

You better find out He may act
like he wants a secretary but most
of the time theyre looking for
something between a mother and a
waitress The rest of the time
well --

(confidentially)
Go home take a paper bag cut
eyeholes out of it Put it over
your head get undressed and look
at yourself in the mirror Really
evaluate where your strengths and
weaknesses are And be honest

Peggy looks up at her a little stunned

PEGGY
I always try to be honest

JOAN
Good for you

As Peggy places her gleaming stapler on the desk she stares
at the two button intercom the rotary telephone and the
electric typewriter

JOAN (CONTD)
Now try not to be overwhelmed by
all this technology

JOAN (CONTD)
It looks complicated but the men
who designed it made it simple
enough for a woman to use

PEGGY
I sure hope so

JOAN
At lunch you need to pick up a box
of chocolates a dozen carnations
and some bath salts I1l explain
later

PEGGY
Thank you Miss Holloway Youre
really wonderful for looking out
for me this way

JOAN
It’s Joan

Joan starts to head away then turns back

JOAN (CONT ’D)
And listen were going to be
working together so dont take this
the wrong way but a girl like you
with those darling little ankles
Id find a way to make them sing
Also men love scarves

Down the hallway comes a slightly disheveled Don Draper
followed by ROGER STERLING an elegant WASP with an
incredible head of grey hair Roger is the Sterling in
Sterling Cooper Advertising

As they whisk by Joan straightens up and sticks her chest
out She motions for Peggy to stand up as well

JOAN (CONTD)
Good morning Mr Draper Oh And
Mr Sterling How are you

ROGER

As they enter Dons office Don automatically hands Joan his
hat and overcoat and then closes the door behind them

Long night Its not this tobacco

DON
It has been on my mind

ROGER
Well I should hope so Lee Garner
and his father and the whole ‘Lucky
Strike family will be here at

DON
Are you worried

Don opens a drawer revealing a stack of freshly identical
white shirts still wrapped from the laundry He takes one
out and changes into it while they talk

ROGER
No if I was worried Id ask you
what you have But Im not So
Im just going to assume that you
have something Which means you
should be worried

Don folds down his collar and starts tying his tie
DON
So you came by because you wanted
to watch me get dressed
ROGER

No I wanted make sure you were
here

Don drops a couple of Alka-Seltzer into a glass
DON
In body yes Give me about a half
an hour for the rest
Roger heads out but then stops remembering something
ROGER
Do we have anyhow do I put this

Have we ever hired any Jews

DON

DON
You want me to go down to the deli
and grab somebody

ROGER
(pointing to Dons shirt)
You missed a button
Roger exits Don buttons his shirt He is now perfectly
dressed He looks out at the spectacular view of Manhattan
and closes the venetian blinds Now in his dim office he
lays carefully on the couch He looks up at the ceiling and
stares a moment at the dark florescent fixture A fly
buzzes trapped inside He closes his eyes

Unfazed Don continues as they round a corner

DON
Advertising is a very small world

day you make it even smaller
Keep it up and even if you do get
my job youll never run this
place Youll die in that corner

hair who women go home with out of

pity

Theyve arrived at the big board room Don stops and

She sends her regards

DR EMERSON

scream to work with her

PEGGY
Yes

Its pretty terrific

DR EMERSON
Try to make yourself comfortable
and relax

Dr Emerson nods towards the stirrups Peggy leans back and
stares up at the acoustic tile Dr Emerson adjusts the
reflector on his forehead and begins to palpate Peggys
stomach

DR EMERSON (CONTD)
I see from your chart and your
finger youre not married

PEGGY
Thats right

DR EMERSON
And yet youre interested in the
contraceptive pills

PEGGY
Well I--

DR EMERSON
No reason to be nervous Joan sent
you to me because Im not here to
judge you Theres nothing wrong
with a woman being practical about
the possibility of sexual activity
Spread your knees

PEGGY
(trying to be casual)
Thats good to hear

DR EMERSON
Of course as a doctor one would
like to think that putting a woman
in this situation its not going
to turn her into some kind of
strumpet Slide your fanny towards
me Im not going to bite

Peggy winces as he inserts the speculum

DR EMERSON (CONTD)
Ill warn you now I will take you
off this medicine if you abuse it

Peggy looks towards him but is blinded by the light on his
forehead All she hears is his disembodied voice

DR EMERSON (CONTD)
Its really for your own good but
the fact is even in our modern
times easy women dont find
husbands

PEGGY
I understand Dr Emerson I
really am a very responsible
person

He turns off his light and goes to the other side of the
room He lights a cigarette

DR EMERSON

girl Now Joan

Peggy starts to awkwardly put her clothes on turning her
back to the Doctor

DR EMERSON (CONTD)
Im going to write you a
prescription for Enovid Theyre
eleven dollars a month But dont
think you have to go out and become
the town pump to get your moneys
worth Excuse my French

Peggy smiles politely and takes the prescription

INT STERLING COOPER BOARD ROOM - LATER 19

Rachel Mencken sits between David Cohen and Pete listening to
Don and Roger give their pitch-- Don standing by some mock-up
ads The table is lined with Shrimp Cocktails toast points
and a pitcher of Bloody Marys

ROGER
So what Dons saying is that
through a variety of media
including a spot during The Danny
Thomas Show if you can afford it
we can really boost awareness

DON
Then a ten-percent off coupon in
select ladies magazines will help
increase your first time visitors
(sits grabs a shrimp)
After weve got them in the store
its kind of up to you

RACHEL
Mr Draper our store is sixty
years old We share a wall with
Tiffanys Honestly a coupon

DON
Miss Mencken coupons work I
think your father would agree with
the strategy

RACHEL
He might But hes not here
because we just had our lowest
sales year Ever So I suppose
what I think matters most right
now

(CONTTNURFD )

Pilot Episode “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” Pink 42006 23

Rachel takes out a cigarette

PETE
Miss Mencken why did you come
here There are a dozen other
agencies better suited to your
needs

RACHEL
If I wanted some man who happened
to be from the same village as my
father to handle my account I
could have stayed where I was
Their research favors coupons too

ROGER
Miss Mencken its not just
research Housewives love coupons

RACHEL
Im not interested in housewives

DON
(frustrated)
So what kind of people do you
want

RACHEL
I want your kind of people Mr
Draper People who dont care
about coupons whether they can
afford it or not People who are
coming to the store because it is
expensive

DON
We obviously have very different
ideas

RACHEL
Yes like the customer is always
right Gentlemen I really
thought you could do better than
this Sterling Cooper has a
reputation for being innovative

DON
(raising his voice)
You are way out of line Miss

Roger takes hold of the situation

Pete lights it smiling

ROGER
Don please Lets not get
emotional here Theres no reason
we cant talk this out

DON
Talk out what Some silly idea
that people will go to some store
theyve never been to because its
more expensive

RACHEL
It works for Chanel

DON
(steely)
Mencken’s is not Chanel

RACHEL
Thats a vote of confidence

Now Pete tries to ease the tension

PETE
What Dons saying is that Chanel
is a very different kind of place
Its French Its continental

Its--
RACHEL
Not just another Jewish department
store
PETE
Exactly

Rachel stumps out her cigarette in the shrimp cocktail

RACHEL
You were right Roger this place
really runs on charm

DON
(standing up)
This is ridiculous

ROGER
Don--

DON
(to Rachel)
Im not going to let a woman talk
to me like this This meeting is
over Good luck Miss Mencken

the pitcher of Bloody Marys As Roger glares David

awkwardly stops caught

INT STERLING COOPER HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Don walks down the corridor at a brisk clip with Pete

trailing a step behind

PETE
Hey Don I dont blame you She
was way out of line
(catching up)
Adding money and education doesnt
take the rude edge out of people

DON
Well Rogers not going to be
happy So I guess thats good for
you

Pete grabs his arm stops him

PETE
Im not going to pretend that I
dont want your job But you were
right Im not great with people
and you are I mean not counting
that meeting we were just in So
Im kind of counting on you to help
me out Theres plenty of room at
the top

Don calms down

DON
Yeah Im sorry I was so hard on
you before Its this damn tobacco
thing

PETE
Youll think of something A man
like you I’d follow into combat
blindfolded And I wouldn’t be the
first Am I right buddy

Pete holds out his hand Don just looks at him
DON
Lets take this a little slower I

dont want to wake up pregnant

Joan stops in front of a door

JOAN (CONTD)

willing and cheerful co-operation
of a few skilled employees Never

INT DON DRAPERS OFFICE - AFTERNOON 23

Don leans back in his chair eyes closed for a moment then
slaps his face to alert himself He opens a desk drawer
pulling out a chest exerciser which is just a few springs and
some handles As he does a small black leather box drops to
the floor popping open He puts the exerciser on the desk
and returns the contents to the box-- we see it’s a US ARMY
purple heart medal He flips the lid closed “LIEUT DONALD
FRANCIS DRAPER” in gold on the outside He regards it a
moment and puts it back in the drawer He then taps a
cigarette out lights it and begins to exercise as he smokes

SALVATORE ROMANO transparently gay--although in 1960 no one
seems to know it--stands in the doorway with a hand on his
hip like Marlene Dietrich

SALVATORE
Aw look at you Gidget Still
trying to fill out that bikini

DON
Its worth a try

Salvatore puts a couple of trace paper sketches on the desk

SALVATORE
Without the medical claims all we
have is a white box with a red spot
on it

He shows Don a sketch of a shirtless man in a hammock
smoking The word above says Relax

SALVATORE (CONTD)
My neighbor posed for this
Believe me he always looks very
relaxed
(giggles a little)
Of course he doesnt smoke I had
him hold a pencil

DON
If I know these guys youre better
off with a little sex appeal Can
you give me a woman in a bathing
suit Put your guy next to her

SALVATORE
Oh a sexy girl I can do that

(CONTTNURFD )

Pilot Episode

DON
Give you a chance to get a real
model

SALVATORE

(too enthusiastic)
I love my work Speaking of sexy
girls are you going to Petes
bachelor party

DON
Im not really big on those things

SALVATORE
Oh tell me about it Its so
embarrassing If a girls going to
shake it in my face I want to be
alone so I can do something

Salvatore opens the desk drawer and takes out a bottle of
whiskey and two glasses

SALVATORE (CONTD)
Should we drink before the meeting
or after Or both

DON
So thats it huh Relax
thats all we have

SALVATORE
Dont be short with me Youre the

try

right down to her bun hairstyle and clipboard

Her eyes follow Peggy as she leaves

GRETA (CONTD)
I see you have another attractive
young plaything

DON
You can fight with Campbell over
her

Salvatore spits his drink back into his glass stifling a

laugh

GRETA
(amused)
You both seem more relaxed than I
expected Do you have some kind of
surprise for the tobacco people

DON
(re cigarette)
Im doing my own research

GRETA
If you are planning to continue
with medical testimony youll only
be inviting further government
interference We must police
ourselves

SALVATORE
Well theres your slogan

DON
(to Greta)
The medical thing is dead we all
understand that

GRETA

Yes dead An apt choice of words
Considering the public is convinced
that cigarettes are poisonous If
we cant insist that theyre not
I believe my most recent surveys
have provided a solution

(re report)
We can still suggest that
cigarettes are part of American
life or “Too good to give up”
and most appealing an assertion of
independence

DON
So basically if you love danger
youll love smoking

SALVATORE
We could put a skull and crossbones
on the label I love it

GRETA
Before the war when I studied with
Adler in Vienna we postulated that
what Freud called the Death Wish
is as powerful a drive as those for
sexual reproduction and physical
sustenance

DON
Freud you say-- which agency is he
with

SALVATORE
So were supposed to believe people
are living one way and secretly
thinking the exact opposite
Thats ridiculous

DON
Let me tell you something Miss
Guttman-—-

GRETA
Doctor

DON

Dr Guttman psychology is terrific
t a cocktail party but it happens
eople were buying cigarettes

efore Freud was born The issue
snt why should people smoke--
ts why should people smoke Lucky
trike Suggesting our customers
ave a what did you call it A
Death Wish Well I just dont
see that on a billboard

DMEF OO

SALVATORE

Its all a big scare anyway So
what if Readers Digest says
theyre dangerous They also said
Bambi was the book of the
century Theres no proof no
studies

GRETA
Theres conclusive proof that none
of these low-tar low-nicotine or
filtration systems have any effect
on the incidences of lung cancer

DON
This isnt Germany If you were
right the government would shut
down the tobacco companies not
just limit advertising Just give
me the damn report

GRETA
(hands it to him)
I think youll find it very
convincing

DON
Im sure I will You were the one
who dug up all our medical
testimonials to begin with

GRETA
Thats true Mr Draper but--

Greta gives what passes for a smile

DON
Has anyone else seen this
GRETA
No of course not Its your
account
DON

Good I dont want to hear about
it again Im sorry but I find
your whole approach perverse

GRETA
I understand Good luck at the

Im sure it will be a quick one

The large table in the board room is covered with ashtrays
LEE GARNER JUNIOR a forty-ish tobacco magnate and his
father LEE GARNER SENIOR sit flanked with other tobacco
executives Across the table Roger Don and Pete listen
patiently to LEE GARNER Srs lilting southern anger

LEE GARNER SENIOR
I just dont know what we have to
do to make these government
interlopers happy They tell us to
build a safer cigarette and we do
it Then suddenly thats not good
enough

LEE GARNER JUNIOR
We might as well be living in
Russia

He coughs Suddenly a round of spontaneous coughing begins
among all of the people in the board room It dies down

LEE GARNER SENIOR
Damn straight You know this
morning I got a call from my
competitors at Brown and Williamson
and theyre getting sued by the
federal government because of the
health claims they made

ROGER
Were aware of that Mr Garner
But you have to realize that
through manipulation of the mass
media the public is under the
impression that your cigarettes are
linked to certain fatal
diseases

LEE GARNER SENIOR
Manipulation of the media Thats
what I hired you for Our product
is fine I smoke them myself

LEE GARNER JUNIOR
My Granddad smoked them He died
at 95 years old He was hit by a
truck

ROGER
I understand but our hands are
tied We are no longer allowed to
advertise that Lucky Strikes are
safe

LEE GARNER SENIOR
So what the hell are we going to
do We already funded our own
tobacco research center to put this
whole rumor to rest

ROGER
And thats a great start But it
may not affect sales Don I think
thats your cue

Don opens up a folder its filled with blank pages He
pretends to shuffle the pages around stalling

DON
Well I Ive really thought
about this And hell you know Im
a Lucky Strike man from way
back

From Dons POV we see the anxious stares of all those at the
table In slow motion cigarettes are being lit and men are
exhaling A bead of sweat forms on Dons brow His heart is
pounding in his ears Suddenly the silence is broken by
Petes voice

PETE
I might have a solution

Don does not seem relieved as Pete takes the stage Roger
catches Dons eye but Don looks away

PETE (CONTD)
At Sterling Cooper weve been
pioneering the burgeoning the field
of research And our analysis
shows that the health risks
associated with your products is
not the end of the world

As the executives look at each other curiously Don sees Pete
is reading from Gretas report

what if cigarettes are dangerous

Youre a man The world is

dangerous Smoke your cigarette--

You still have to get where youre

going

LEE GARNER JUNIOR
Thats very interesting
(then)
I mean if cigarettes were
dangerous that would be
interesting

Roger looks around nervously to see if theyre going to bite

LEE GARNER SENIOR
Except they arent Is that your
slogan Youre going to die
anyway Die with us

PETE
Actually its a fairly well
established psychological principal
that society has a Death Wish
And if we could tap into that the
market potential--

LEE GARNER SENIOR

What the hell are you talking
about Why not just write cancer
on the package Are you insane
Im not selling rifles Im in the
tobacco business-- Im selling
America The Indians gave it to us
for shits sake

LEE GARNER JUNIOR
Come on Dad Lets get out of
here

They stand up
LEE GARNER JUNIOR (CONTD)

know that if we have this problem
everybody has this problem

Gentlemen before you leave can I
say something

ROGER
(pointed)
I dont know Can you Don

DON
The Federal Trade Commission and
Readers Digest have done you a
favor Theyve let you know that
any ad that brings up the concept
of health and cigarettes together
well it just makes people think of
cancer

LEE GARNER SENIOR
(sarcastic)
Yes and were grateful to them

DON
But what Lee Junior said is right
If you cant make health claims
neither can your competitors

LEE GARNER SENIOR
Great so we got a lot of people
not saying anything that sells
cigarettes

DON
Not exactly This is the greatest
advertising opportunity since the
invention of cereal We have six
identical companies with six
identical products We can say
anything we want

The men sit down interested Don walks over to a black
board

Don writes on the board Lucky Strike - Its Toasted

The men all look at it not sure how to react

LEE GARNER JUNIOR
But everybody elses tobacco is

toasted

DON
No Everybody elses tobacco is
poisonous Lucky Strike is
toasted

Rogers face lights with a slow smile of pride and awe

ROGER
Gentlemen I dont have to tell you
what youve just witnessed here

LEE GARNER JUNIOR
I think you do

Don gathers his thoughts and lowers his voice

DON
Advertising is based on one thing
happiness And you know what
happiness is

Don looks out the window into the setting sun almost lost

DON (CONTD)

Happiness is the smell of a new
car Its freedom from fear
Its a billboard on the side of the
road that screams with reassurance
that whatever youre doing is okay

(almost to himself)
You are okay

The tobacco people look at each other with understanding and

relief

really I mean actually hearing
all the things I always assumed
people were thinking

Im really not as bad as all that
I was under a lot of pressure
Another account It doesnt really
matter

RACHEL
No it doesnt

DON
So without making things worse can
I ask you a personal question

If I werent a woman I would be
allowed to ask you the same
question And I suppose if I
werent a woman I wouldnt have to
choose between putting on an apron
and the thrill of making my
fathers store what I always
thought it should be

DON
So thats it You wont get
married because you think business
is a thrill

RACHEL
(smiling)

That and I have never been in
love

DON
She wont get married because
shes never been in love I think
I wrote that It was to sell
nylons

RACHEL

For a lot of people love isnt
just a slogan

DON
Oh love You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart where
you cant eat cant work so you
run off and get married and make
babies

He looks at Rachel and smiles She doesnt smile back

DON (CONTD)
The reason you havent felt it is
because it doesnt exist What you
call love was invented by guys
like me to sell nylons

RACHEL
Is that right
