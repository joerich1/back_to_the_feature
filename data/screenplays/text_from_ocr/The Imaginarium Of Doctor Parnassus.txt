May 26th

LONDON 2007 NOW

EXT NIGHT URBAN TERRACE

A row of rundown terrace houses Some are boarded up Not
the street lights work Those that do cast shadows of par
vehicles glistening in the rain

A front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he

in a bin He hears something and looks up to see four big
horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of t
street The wagon is a gigantic windowless box The horse

are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver

Its a very weird sight DON unable to take his eyes off
this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from w
light from a TV flickers

DON

CAROL disgusted swats him on the head with the flat of her
hand and goes back inside
EXTINT NIGHT PARKED CAR IN STREET

A YOUNG COUPLE are snogging in the back of a parked car
Music is playing on the radio

They are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying
sight of the huge looming horse-drawn box as it trundles
past

EXT NIGHT THE TOWN HALL CLOCK

The clock shows and strikes 2am

EXT NIGHT A DINGY BACK STREET

The wagon has stopped The back begins to open top bottom
and sides like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals

Shadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise
the roof

While this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a
garishly lit club across the street

A group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club staggering
laughing shouting drinking breaking bottles and throwing
up The LADS grope the GIRLS Everyones having a great
time

They see the wagon and stop unsteadily in their tracks

MARTIN
What the

We now see what they see The wagon has been converted into a
stage Were looking at an old fashioned and very shabby
travelling theatre Electric footlights are powered by a
clanking generator The pediment above the stage carries the
words THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS

PERCY a dwarf dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as
a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man
(ANTON 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the
stage dressed as MERCURY the messenger of the gods with
wings on his helmet and sandals

4

ANTONMERCURY
Ladies and Gentlemen Step up
Step up I Mercury the
messenger of the gods invite
you tonight for one night
only at this very venue to
enter the mind the very great
mind of Doctor Parnassus

PERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind
ANTONMERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears
to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard chalk white
make up a large red circle on his bald head a crown of
yellow flowers strings of beads and partially covered in a
loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating
several feet above the stage (Hes sitting on a glass
plinth) DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance A bronze
tripod containing burning incense stands beside him

ANTONMERCURY (CONTD)
Doctor Parnassus as old as
time yes ladies and gentlemen
more than a thousand years old

he has the power to empower your
mind A secret learned in the
mystic East Let Doctor Parnassus
open your imagination Let him
guide and transport you to worlds
and possibilities you never dreamt

of If you dare But Beware
there are dangers You will have to
choose Will your soul fly Or

will it be dashed on the rocks of
darkness The choice is yours and
yours alone Transcend the heights
on Beautys wing

A young woman VALENTINA (wearing a wig of long blonde hair

and a white flowing costume which gives her prominent hips

and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length
mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a

forest This is Beauty She turns and steps forward

ANTON takes her hand They make a couple of dance steps
together They look enchanting and enchanted

ANTONMERCURY (CONTD)
(to the audience)
Or if you must

Now PERCY in demon costume leaps from behind the scenery 4

ANTONMERCURY (CONTD)
scour the squalid depths with
Putrids brother Stench

PERCY indicates a ticket dispenser attached to the front of
the stage

PERCY
Take a ticket and join the queue
Only five quid a go Theres no
greater bargain on planet earth
A beer bottle lands on the stage

The DRUNKEN YOUTHS cheer

ANTONMERCURY
You choose Fulfilment grace and
light or Waste filth and

darkness

(under his breath

watching the drunk

MARTIN with contempt)
No prizes for guessing what youll
do

MARTIN has begun with difficulty to clamber onto the stage
His MATES laugh and shout encouragement

ANTON
(not in character he
stutters)
No Sorry Thats n-not allowed
You have to t-take a t-ticket
first

ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage But
MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the “audience

MARTINS drunken MATES laugh and applaud

MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who
is still in a trance

PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the
stage PERCY lands on the ground with a crash

More laughter from the MOB

MARTIN
(drunkenly to PARNASSUS)
Hey youI wanna audition I
wan I wanna be a star I
wanna
MARTIN is on the verge of tweaking DOCTOR PARNASSUS nose or
pulling his beard when VALENTINA diverts him

VALENTINA
Stop Get off the stage

MARTIN turns his bleary focus to VALENTINA

MARTIN
Thas a nice pair of jugs

MARTINS mates roar their approval

VALENTINA
Get off the stage

MARTIN
No I wan you I wan you

MARTIN lunges at “Beauty who retreats up stage

MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues “Beauty who
stays just out of reach She takes cover behind a cut-out
tree

ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues
to chase Beauty VALENTINA evades him by ducking through
the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down
the middle) MARTIN crashes after her

ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks They look at DOCTOR
PARNASSUS Should they wake him from his trance They decide
not to but its a difficult decision

INTEXT MAGICAL FOREST

The stage set which was clearly only a few feet deep now
seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees

“Beauty weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as
MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical
forest Beautys costume has been transformed into something
wonderful (A rainbow studded with diamonds)

VALENTINA comes into view MARTIN is in hot pursuit

MARTIN
Come here you little sexpot

VALENTINA stops turns smiles sweetly and slams her fist
hard into MARTINS gut He doubles up VALENTINA pauses for a
moment contemplating doing some serious damage before
striding off

MARTIN staggers to his feet

MARTIN (CONTD)
Come back You bitch

He rushes after her but trips on a root (a real 3
dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground
Recovering he looks up Shock He is surrounded by a dark
terrible and very REAL forest “Beauty has vanished

EXT THE STAGE NIGHT

VALENTINA “Beauty slips back on stage through the mirror
Her costume has reverted to its original state She examines
her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin
ANTON looks at her She shrugs DR PARNASSUS is still ina
trance his lips moving soundlessly ANTON watches DOCTOR
PARNASSUS in awe “Beauty sighs Shes had enough

INTEXT MAGICAL FOREST

MARTIN is lost and terrified in the dark forest

MARTIN
MumMum

His voice echoes through the giant trees But his cries are
interrupted by another sounda Tarzan-like howl

MARTIN spins around Strange creatures are swinging on vines
through the giant trees They are all around him They look
like HANDS with little heads and arms where the wrists
should be They are all howling and jabbering

From behind a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by
the collar hoisting him high into the air

Clearing the trees MARTIN sees he is not alone There are
many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES
swinging on vines

7
But the vines are actually long slim tentacles
dangling from enormous luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float
through the dark frightening sky
From some of the tentacles bottles of booze dangle - just
out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a
drink
MARTIN (CONTD)

Please Ill never Never

again Honest From now on I

swear Not a drop
With a smile of satisfaction the HAND CREATURE stops
jabbering and lets go of MARTINS collar
Down he plummets The ground rushes up MATRTIN is as good
as dead But when he hits the ground rather than going
SPLAT he bounces high in the air turns a couple
somersaults and lands on his feet
He cant believe what has just happened and then he hears
music Beautiful ethereal music
In the distance a light is glowing Its the sun rising
above a majestic mountain pass Cut into the rock is a long
stairway winding up to the summit
The HAND CREATURE swings down gives MARTIN the thumbs up
and points encouragingly toward the stairway
Reformed and determined MARTIN heads for the stairs But on
reaching them he discovers that each one is 6 feet high The
stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult Letters are
carved into the first stairTHE 12X12 STEP PROGRAM GOOD

LUCK This is going to be tough

The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn Behind him
the sky is dark A roadside barnightclub with flashing neon
lights has appeared He hesitates He could use a drink
before the long climb He heads for the club

The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground
figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a
bowler hat and a red waistcoat

MR NICK
Hi there Cmon in Looks like you
could use a drink 7

MARTIN relieved and reassured by the welcome steps inside
The door closes followed by the sound from within of much
gaiety and laughter

THE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A
BALL OF FLAME

EXT DINGY BACK STREET 8

The sound of police sirens We are back outside in front of
the theatre

DR PARNASSUS rises unsteadily coming out of his arduous
trance “Beauty moves to support him as exhausted he
loses his balance and snaps out of his trance

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(holding his head)
Valentina

VALENTINA
(indignant)
He was chasing me

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(angry)

You dont go through the mirror

VALENTINA
I had to get away

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
You hit him

VALENTINA
Self defence

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Youre out of control Ever since
your mother died

VALENTINA
When I was three

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
I dont want to talk about it

VALENTINA

(indignant)
You brought it up

8

DOCTOR PARNASSUS turns on ANTON

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
We dont accept drunks

ANTON
We c-couldnt stop him

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
People must be in their right minds
when they make the choice

ANTON
I know Im s-sorry

DRUNKEN GIRL (VO)
Martin

The POLICE are dealing with a drunken mob of nightclub
REVELLERS making arrests

A distraught hysterical DRUNKEN GIRL is looking for MARTIN

DRUNKEN GIRL (CONTD)
Martin Martin
She sees “Beauty

DRUNKEN GIRL (CONTD)
He went with that cow Ill scratch
her eyes out

A POLICEWOMAN grabs the DRUNKEN GIRL and drags her
struggling into police van

MARTINS FRIENDS are searching for him around the stage

FRIEND OF MARTIN
Marty Marty where are you
(a POLICEMAN grabs him) )
Oi Leave offits themtheyve
got our mate back there

POLICEMAN
(to PARNASSUS)
You Gunga Din What do you think
youre playing at

DR PARNASSUS
Playing We dont ‘play What we
do is deadly serious 8

DR PARNASSUS pushes aside the mirror to reveal a door in the
back wall of the shallow stage It is swinging open

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Gone Will we miss him I dont
think so

The POLICEMAN looks and frowns

DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
(to the POLICEMAN
condescendingly)
Dont worry if you dont understand
it immediately

PERCY wisely decides to head off conflict He steers DOCTOR
PARNASSUS away from the POLICEMAN

PERCY

(to POLICEMAN)
Hes doing his bit to save the
human race He thinks its got a
future Quaint eh I keep telling
him to get a proper job

(shaking his empty

collection cup)
Check it out another night with
nothing in the kitty

POLICEMAN
I want you freaks out of here Now
If I ever see you in this parish
again Ill do you

DOCTOR PARNASSUS bows exaggeratedly with a hint of mockery

The POLICE OFFICER suspects that DOCTOR PARNASSUS is taking
the piss but decides not to press it Instead he knees
MARTINS struggling friend to the ground

EXT BACK STREETS DAWN 9

The sky is grey with the first light of dawn The wagon rolls
off down the dark street as a dustcart rumbles into view and
its CREW begin emptying bins and picking up rubbish

EXT A HOLIDAY FAIR NIGHT 10

Shooting galleries Music Loud aggressive rides PEOPLE
milling around

10

The wagon is parked at the edge of the fair The stage is
set ANTON dressed as Mercury is trying to attract an
audience without much success

ANTON
Step up Step up For one night
only The Imaginarium of Dr
Parnassus Not to be missed

On stage is DOCTOR PARNASSUS “levitating and in a trance
as before Incense smoke swirls around him

ANTON (CONTD)
Test your imagination Envisage the
sublime Let Doctor Parnassus be
your guide Discover the heights of
Wisdom

VALENTINA dances forward looking fabulous as ‘Wisdom

ANTON (CONTD)
Or if you will visit the
doldrums with all thats vile and
stinks

PERCY steps forward once again in his mediaeval demon
costume

PERCY
(indicating ticket
machine)
Take a ticket and wait your turn
Twenty quid a go reduced to five
for one night only

ANTON
The world is full of wonders
beauty enchantment for those with
eyes to see

He magically produces a bouquet of flowers Throws it into
the air it transforms into beautiful doves

This impressive trick is totally ignored by a group loudly
arguing just in front of the stage - THE FAMILY FROM HELL

LINDA
(aged 7)
Mum Mum I want to go on the
wall of death 10
Stop going on Linda Youre not
old enough

DAD
They wont let you darling

LINDA
But I want to I want to

MUM
LINDA

DR PARNASSUS stirs from his trance Hes had enough of this

DR PARNASSUS
Excuse me Excuse me Would you
mind

LINDA
Its not fair

UNCLE BOB
Its the fair but its not fair

UNCLE BOB laughs uproariously LINDA pushes him into AUNTY
FLO

AUNTY FLO
Ow Bloody hell

Diego - aged 9 and absorbed in his portable video game
wanders away from the family

MUM
LINDA BEEHAVE YOURSELF IM
WARNING YOU

DAD
Leave her alone

DR PARNASSUS
Please This is The Imaginarium It
requires respect concentration
Kindly go elsewhere and take your
detritus with you

MUM
Is he insulting us 10
DAD
(to the DR PARNASSUS
threateningly)

Oy
PARNASSUS ignores him and resumes his trance

Unnoticed by all DIEGO has somehow managed to climb onto the
stage and is peering at the mirror

MUM
(looking around)
Diego Wheres Diego

DAD
DIEGO

VALENTINA turns her head just in time to see DIEGO vanish
through the mirror

She starts to go after him then hesitates

VALENTINA
(trying to get ANTONS
attention)
Pssst

ANTON looks across the stage to her She mimes that a certain
someone has gone into the mirror ANTON considers waking
DOCTOR PARNASSUS but thinks better of it Instead he heads
off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of Diego
VALENTINA takes over the pitch

VALENTINA (CONTD)
Ladies and Gentlemen let Dr
Parnassus be your guide

INTEXT MAGICAL LANDSCAPE 11
ANTON moves through the cut -out trees and into a fantastic
brightly coloured landscape of Dr Seuss-like hills and

valleys The sky if full of cloud-sized soap bubbles

Diego is in the distant using his game controller to make the
bubbles bang into each othertrying to burst them

We can hear VALENTINA trying to continue the pitch in the
face of the family from hell Their baby has now started
wailing

Cracks in the ground begin to appear under ANTONS feet

11
VALENTINA (VO)
Beauty Truth Wisdom Justice
without imagination all are dead
MUM (VO)
DIEGO
DAD (VO)
DIEGO
LINDA (VO)
DEGSY
DR PARNASSUS (VO)
OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD SHUT UP
The landscape in response to DR PARNASSUS rage suddenly
rips apart fragmenting and spinning with ANTON inside it
DR PARNASSUS (V0O) (CONTD)
(enraged)
AAAHHHH DAMN AND BLAST
Things fly in all directions
INTEXT MAGICAL LANDSCAPE 12

ANTON recovering struggles out from between giant blocks of
stone The world has gone dark

He hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to
clamber over the shattered monoliths

Reaching the top ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant
rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms There are
what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on
either side of the pinnacle
CUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror Is he
lost inside a video game he cant control He presses the
buttons on his gaming device - to no avail

One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under
way all very video-game-like Thrilling aggressive music
blares forth

MR NICK appears still in red waist-coat and bowler hat but
this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a
bulls-eye on his chest

12

MR NICK
Come on laddy cross the bridge
Join up Be a man Kill the enemy
Impress your dad Unlimited ammo
Great fun Pow Pow Pow

As he speaks bullets fly Each time MRNICK gets shot and is
knocked flat he pops back up continuing his spiel

The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano
keys and looks very rickety and unsafe The piano key bridge
descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL
PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos all playing
the same tune - the tune DR PARNASSUS is humming but with
stern demanding PIANO TEACHERS in attendance

PIANO TEACHERS
No no start again Again From
the top Again Practice Practice
DIEGO doesnt know what to do
Behind him rises a strange Mongolfier balloon DR
PARNASSUSs face is repeated again and again around its
circumference ANTONS in the basket

DIEGO catches sight of ANTON

DIEGO
Help
(indicating gaming device)
It doesnt work Its broken

ANTON
What
DIEGO
The game
ANTON

What g-g-game

DIEGO
The game The video game The one
were in

ANTON
I d-d-dont know what youre t-t-
talking about

DIEGO
Help me

12 ANTON
(miserable )
I c-cant

DIEGO
What

ANTON
Im n-not supposed to be here

DIEGO
What am I going to do

ANTON
Thats the p-point Its up to you

DIEGO
(dismayed)
But Dont leave me Dont let me
die

But ANTON has gone
DIEGO terrified tests the bridge to the war games

MR NICK
Attaboy sonny Join the men
Nothing to it Hup two hup two

He hesitatesthe music from the pianos seems to have an
effect on him He comes to a decision He drops his gaming
device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly
piano keys

The CUT-OUT shooting target MR NICK isnt happy

MR NICK (CONTD)
No wait Thats the wrong choice
That bridge leads to failure and
despair Youll be dead before
youre thirty This is the one
This is the bridge to manhood

DIEGO looks uncertain unnerved For a moment we think he
might change his mind but he presses bravely on across the
piano bridge

EXT A HOLIDAY FAIR NIGHT 13

At last finally theres a bit of a crowd around the
theatre but drawn only by the FAMILY FROM HELL who are
making a lot of noise

MUM
(hysterical)
Hes been kidnapped Theyve taken
him Its that weirdo up there Do
something Dad do something

LINDA
I want my brother I want my little
brother

On stage DR PARNASSUS continues to hum in his trance-like
state INSPECTOR OF FAIRS rattles on

INSPECTOR
You cannot perform here without
appropriate authorization

Getting no response from DR PARNASSUS he pulls out his
mobile phone and dials

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
(with phone to ear)
Its me I need some support Weve
got trouble

ANTON steps out of the mirror He produces an inflated
balloon which he releases and which then flies zig-zagging
out over the audience

DR PARNASSUS wakes in time to see the balloon

DR PARNASSUS
(delighted with Antons

message)
Haha Success One little devil
out of the fire makes it all
worthwhile

He magically produces a Tarot Card from the startled
INSPECTORS ear

INSPECTOR
Where did you say youre from

13 13

DR PARNASSUS
I didnt

He lifts his arm with a flourish whereupon a gloriously
painted canvas sky unrolls from the top of the set disgorging
DIEGO as it reaches the stage

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
Hooplah

DIEGO rolls out tumbles across the stage and lands next to
the rest of his FAMILY Hes beaming laughing full of
wonder transformed by his experience

MUM
Diego Where have you been Ive
been worried sick

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(descending from his glass

plinth)
And so a glimmer of hope
Perhaps eternity has not been in

vain
DAD smacks DIEGO round the back of the head

DAD
And you can wipe that silly
expression off your face you
little poof

LINDA
(gleefully)
Youre in big trouble Youre in
big trouble

UNCLE BOB
Youve upset your mum

AUNTY FLO
Hes spoilt our evening

DAD
And wheres your gamer Hes lost
his bloody gamer Another fifty
quid down the drain Youre not
getting another one Bloody kids
Why do we bother

THE FAMILY FROM HELL moves off 13
DIEGO full of wonder and oblivious to his family looks back
at PARNASSUS and gives the old man the thumbs-up

PARNASSUS smiles and raises his thumb in response

The INSPECTOR OF FAIRS is joined by a POLICEMAN and

POLICEWOMAN

POLICEMAN
Whats the trouble

DR PARNASSUS
Ah the fuzz

POLICEMAN
What did you say

DR PARNASSUS
(charmingly)
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear Fuzzy Wuzzy
had no hair Fuzzy Wuzzy wasnt
fuzzy wuzzy

The POLICE and the INSPECTOR exchange dark looks Clearly
theyre dealing with a dangerous trouble-maker

INSPECTOR
(to Parnassus)
Next time I find you doing business
without a permit Ill impound your
wagon

POLICEMAN
(to Parnassus)
Ill be doing worse than
thatnow bugger off

DR PARNASSUS
With pleasure

He bows mock graciously

INT BACK STAGE DRESSING ROOM A MOMENT LATER 14

Valentina half-undressed is struggling out of her ‘Wisdom
costume while at the same time looking at pictures of
beautiful homes and gardens in a very battered copy of “Homes
and Gardens Without make-up and costume she appears much
younger

14

A movement of something reflected in the dressing-room mirror
catches her eye

In the mirror we see MR NICK not a CUT-OUT but the real
thing

VALENTINA
(startled guiltily hiding
“Homes and Gardens)
on

She turns holding her dress to cover her modesty Theres
nobody there

VALENTINA (CONTD)
Whos that Whos there

EXT EDGE OF FAIR THE WAGON CONTINUOUS 15
ANTON and PERCY are packing-up and closing the wagon

DR PARNASSUS out of his make-up and costume is smiling and
humming to himself as he removes the feed bag from one of the
horses

The horse lifts its head and DR PARNASSUS recoils in shock
and horror Standing directly behind the horse is MR NICK
a huge grin splitting his face

MR NICK
Hello Parnassus Its been a
while hasnt it

PERCY winding a rope onto a cleat hears distant laughter
and looks up

CUT TO PERCYS POV where we see some distance away and in
a relatively secluded spot MR NICK rocking with laughter
while DOCTOR PARNASSUS looks stricken He clutches at the
back of a park bench to steady himself

CUT TO PERCY who looks thoughtful and worried He heads off
to help DOCTOR PARNASSUS as the latter slumps onto the bench
MR NICK has vanished

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(distraught)
Hes come to collect

PERCY
I thought so

15

DR PARNASSUS
What can I do

PERCY
(grimly)
Nothing

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
There must be something

He looks over to where VALENTINA is helping close the
theatre PERCY follows his gaze

PERCY
Youre going to have to tell her

EXT CITY STREETS LATER 16
The wagon makes its way through city streets
PERCY is sitting on the roof driving ANTON is lying on the
roof looking up at the stars VALENTINA is sitting next to
him lost in thought

ANTON

Look at that moon
(no response from

Valentina)

PERCY holds his hand out palm up

PERCY
(sardonically)

16

VALENTINA

ANTON

VALENTINA
(ironic)
Ecstatic

ANTON produces an old beaten-up copy of “Beautiful Homes and
starts thumbing through it

VALENTINA (CONTD)
Hey Thats mine

She tries to snatch it from him He flutters it out of her
reach

VALENTINA (CONTD)
Give it me

She wrests it from him and hides it just as PERCY looks back
at them

ANTON

(sotto voce)
Would you really be happy in one of
those p-places N-not me

(suddenly urgent)

(gesturing to the passing city)
You know normal Ordinary
Youre so lucky

ANTON isnt sure how to take this
VALENTINA (CONTD)
(half apologetically)

You know what I mean

She gets up kisses ANTON on the top of his head and climbs
down into the hatch

Anton looks thoughtful bruised

PERCY glances back

VALENTINA (CONTD)
(popping her head back up)
Actually Im going to be sixteen
Shall I tell Parnassus I know I
think he knows I know Silly man
Sweet sixteen

She disappears down the hatch then quickly pops back up

VALENTINA (CONTD)
(mischievously)
The age of consent

INT DOCTOR PARNASSUS DEN THAT MOMENT

DOCTOR PARNASSUS cabin is tiny Its packed with books and
memorabilia EgyptianAssyrianGreeketc magic trick
paraphernalia and much else

A hanging lantern suspended from the ceiling throws moving
shadows

DR PARNASSUS is slumped despondently on a cramped bed A
plate of untouched food sits on a table in front of him

He has laid out tarot cards To the right - The Magus to
the left - The Devil The next card is The Maiden He places
it carefully beneath The Magus

17

He picks up an open bottle of spirits and takes a swig
Clearly hes already had a few drinks

VALENTINA 0S
(cross with him)
You havent eaten anything

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(startled)

Valentina

She comes in
VALENTINA
I go to all this trouble and you
leave it

DR PARNASSUS
Im not hungry

VALENTINA
Are you ill

DR PARNASSUS
(anguished)
Valentina my miraculous child
I have something to tell you

VALENTINA
Now what

She starts tidying up

DR PARNASSUS
(avoiding the question)
I should never have brought you
into this rotten bloody world

VALENTINA
(shes heard this before)
Oh for Gods sake

DR PARNASSUS
What was I thinking of

VALENTINA
Percy liked the soup

DR PARNASSUS

(agitated)
Why does everybody want to live
forever

17 17
VALENTINA

Thats normal isnt it

DR PARNASSUS
Immortalitys a curse Any fool can
tell you that

Valentina picks up Parnassus nearly empty bottle

VALENTINA
You know it doesnt agree with you

DR PARNASSUS
(in difficulty)
Valentina

VALENTINA
(losing patience)
And Ill be sixteen on Thursday so
lets not have any more tosh about
that

DR PARNASSUS
Listen to me

VALENTINA
You think youre so clever and that
everybody else is an idiot You
cant stop me growing up just by
lying about my birthday Its
ridiculous

DR PARNASSUS
Shut up Shut up and listen to me
Listen to me I need to tell you
something before its too late

DR PARNASSUS reaches up and plucks a glass paperweight out of
the air Its that kind that contains little models which are

engulfed in a snow storm when the paperweight is shaken

DR PARNASSUS shakes the paper-weight and watches the snow
swirl about

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)

One dark winters night Many
years ago
VALENTINA

Is this going to take long 17

DR PARNASSUS
QUIET

THE CAMERA closes in on and “enters the paperweight

DR PARNASSUS (VO) (CONTD)
Many centuries ago as a matter of
fact

EXT INSIDE THE PAPERWEIGHT NIGHT 18

A HOODED RIDER moves slowly through the snowstorm the horse
picking its way carefully across a field of virgin snow

DR PARNASSUS (VO)
I was visited by someone I
had hoped never to meet

In the distance rising like a dark mountain is a strange
monastery Dim light comes from a couple of windows

We can hear from far away the indistinct droning voice of
the story teller a younger DR PARNASSUS

THE CAMERA moves up over and way ahead of the HOODED RIDER
continuing through the snowstorm over fields forests
valleys rocks until it reaches the monastery high ona
rugged hill Here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery
windows taking us into a dining hall

INT MONASTERY DINING HALL NIGHT 19

Entering via a window and looking down into the monastery
dining hall we see DOZENS OF MONKS sitting at a long
refectory table They are eating their supper and listening
to a young DR PARNASSUS who is sitting on a dais at the far
end of the hall his eyes closed in a trance telling a
story

A log fire burns in a big fireplace

DR PARNASSUS
Having captured the wind and
tamed the storm the Chief
Steward laying down to take his
rest had a disturbing dream He

dreamt that a hooded rider was
approaching across the snow-swept
plain

(MORE)

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
A rider who would challenge the
very foundations of the world

The door to the refectory swings open with a crash
The MONKS look up

Standing on the thresh-hold is the hooded figure covered
with snow

He throws off his hood Its MR NICK

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
The Steward woke and remembered
his dream What manner of man had
he dreamt of and what did it
signify

INT MONASTERY DINING HALL LATER
DR PARNASSUS and MR NICK are sitting at the fire
Behind them in the hall MONKS come and go

On the dais a MONK continues with the story This monk is a
younger PERCY

PERCY
And as the waters rose the
peoples need for stories grew
Stories that would feed a great
hunger A hunger for more than just
understanding

PERCY continues telling the story in the background

MR NICK
What exactly do you do here

DR PARNASSUS

We tell the eternal story

MR NICK
Oh Whats that

DR PARNASSUS
The story that sustains the
universe The story without which
there is nothing

20

MR NICK
Nothing Really Are you telling me
that if you stop telling a story
(waving in the direction

of Percy)
This story something you made
up a fiction that the universe

ceases to exist

DR PARNASSUS
You make it sound so simple

MR NICK
And you believe it

DR PARNASSUS smiles

MR NICK (CONTD)
Incredible Its just incredible to
me that you can believe something
that can be so easily disproved

DR PARNASSUS
(complacently)
I dont think so

MR NICK turns and throws a spell at PERCY who goes rigid like
a statue - struck dumb The story stops

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
(alarmed)
No

Another MONK sitting at the table immediately continues the
story

SUBSTITUTE MONK
-having been brought to the limit
of his endurance
MR NICK freezes him too stopping him from speaking

A third monk continues

THIRD MONK
yet the forces of evil could not
prevail and

MRNICK renders him silent

DR PARNASSUS

Stop
( ) 20

MR NICK zaps DR PARNASSUS and all the other MONKS All
still None of them can speak

MR NICK
There you are You see The storys
stopped No more story And yet
were still here the fires still

burning
He pushes open a window
MR NICK (CONTD)
Its still snowing The winds

still blowing Nothings changed

DR PARNASSUS and the MONKS still struck dumb look
appalled

MR NICK (CONTD)
Cheer up Ive freed you from
this ridiculous nonsense

MR NICK undoes the spell

The MONKS moan DR PARNASSUS slumps down in despair

MR NICK smiles and lights a cigarette Hes enjoying this

MR NICK (CONTD)
Now you can use your powers to do
something else Have fun travel
learn a foreign language

Splat A gob of bird shit lands on MR NICKS head An eagle

circles overhead It swoops across the hall and exits through
a window

DR PARNASSUS leaps up laughing amazed revived

DR PARNASSUS
A sign A message That bird was a

messenger from distant places we
know not of
(triumphant)

Other places The point is youre
wrong And Im wrong It doesnt
have to be us here

(indicating monks)
Somewhere in the world at any
given time someone is telling a
story Sustaining the universe
Right now its happening

(MORE ) 20

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
Thats why were still here You
cant stop stories being told
somewhere You cant be everywhere

MR NICK is furious
MR NICK
(irritated)
A weak hypothesis
DR PARNASSUS
(smiling)
Yes

MR NICK stubs out his cigarette

MR NICK
I tell you what Youre probably

not a betting man but
MR NICK whispers into the DR PARNASSUSs ear

DR PARNASSUS (V0O)

And so I made a wager with the
devil

EXT ON THE ROAD (MIDDLE AGES) DAYNIGHT 21

DR PARNASSUS and PERCY are travelling the world with a
little theatre Giving performances Inviting AUDIENCE
MEMBERS onto the stage to participate

DR PARNASSUS (VO)
Whichever of us won ten converts
first would win the bet My
argument was the importance of the
story the power of the

imagination His the power of
material things the supremacy of
stuff Naturally I won

CUT TO another performance Now the 16TH CENTURY

DR PARNASSUS (VO (CONTD)
My prize
(a voice filled with
horror)
was ever-lasting life

Another shownow the 18TH CENTURY

21

DR PARNASSUS (VO) (CONTD)
Everlasting torment
Everlasting Everlasting Times
changed No one wanted our tales
any longer

EXT MODERN CITY STREET DAY 22
DR PARNASSUS and PERCY are performing on a street corner in
modern clothes As are all the PASSERSBY who pay them no
attention

They look exhausted like beggarsand very old

DR PARNASSUS (VO)
It seemed as though the Devil
after all had triumphed And
then one day

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (played by the same actress as Valentina
but older with different coloured hair) comes into view

DR PARNASSUS (VO) (CONTD)
From the very first moment I saw
her I was head-over-heels in love
She was beautiful enchanting
delightful young But I I was
several thousand years old How
could I woo her What could I do

23 EXT CLIFF TOP EVENING

CUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR
PARNASSUS trying to prevent him from throwing himself off
the cliff

PERCY
Dont be a fool You cant die
Youre immortal Youll just end up
broken in the eternity ward and
Ill be stuck looking after you
Forever

DR PARNASSUS breaks free stumbles backwards and pitches
out into space PERCY screams

DR PARNASSUS VO

At times like these the devil is
never far away

23 23

DR PARNASSUS is hanging by his coat snagged on a branch
angled out from the cliff face and held like a fishing rod
by MR NICK who has a great grin on his face

EXT RIVER DAY 24

CUT TO a much younger DR PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
in a row boat picnicking as they float down a river They
are in love very happy to be together

PERCY wearing a blazer flannels and straw boater is rowing
or punting

DR PARNASSUS (VO)
The devil granted me mortality
againand youth and great powers
I won my bride I was in love But
at what price

The boat bumps into a submerged log DR PARNASSUS tries to
push free Several cigarette butts float past Looking up
DR PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank fishing
smoking a cigarette Its MR NICK

There is a loud and ominous clap of thunder

INT PARNASSUS DEN NIGHT 25

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
at what price

DR PARNASSUS looks haggard He closes his eyes He sways and
drops the paper-weight

VALENTINA
Father

At that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear
frantic banging on the roof

DR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on

DR PARNASSUS
Weve stopped

VALENTINA
What do you mean ‘at what price

25

DR PARNASSUS
(turning back to his Tarot
cards)
Itll wait itll wait Another
time Somethings happened Youd
better go and see

VALENTINA
Typical You insist I listen to a
story and then you dont finish it

More banging from above

DR PARNASSUS
Go and see

VALENTINA turns and goes

PARNASSUS looks miserable but almost relieved He turns
over the next card

Its The Hanged Man It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet
surrounded by several arcane objects

PARNASSUS studies the card trying to wring some meaning from
it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the
others He takes a swig from the bottle

EXT WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS BRIDGE NIGHT 26

The wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriars bridge
Its pouring with rain

VALENTINA wearing some sort of covering against the rain
climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon

Here she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames

ANTON
Incredible I saw somebody d-
dancing in the air under the b-
bridge

VALENTINA looks doubtfully at PERCY who peers morosely out
from under his sou-wester and shakes his head

Its true
the water
flashed

ANTON (CONTD)
There was a sh-shadow on
when the lightning

Lightning flashes again

We see what ANTON and VALENTINA see A shadow on the water
of someone ‘dancing hung by his neck with a rope attached
to the underside of the bridge

ANTON (CONTD)

(triumphant)
You see The d-dancer

VALENTINA

(horrified)
Theres someone hanging there

ANTON

(smugly to Percy)
I t-told you

VALENTINA

A rope Get a rope

EXT SIDE OF BLACK FRIARS BRIDGE MOMENTS LATER 27

ANTON is ‘absailing over the side of the bridge

One end of

a rope is tied around his
bridge parapet A lantern

VALENTINA and PERCY watch

waist the other is attached to the

dangles from his

ANTONS perilous

Moments later there are two bodies hanging
the mysterious HANGING MANS and ANTONS

waist
descent

from the bridge

The MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck still jerking
in his dance of death His hands are tied behind his back

ANTON cant reach the MAN

ANTON
(shouting up)
I c-cant reach him

VALENTINA
Try again

PERCY
Swing in

VALENTINA
Hurry up

27

ANTON shoots PERCY and VALENTINA a jaundiced look and with
VALENTINAS help on her end of the rope begins to swing back
and forth

Eventually with a big enough swing he manages to hook his
foot around the HANGING MAN who has gone limp Dead

With extreme difficulty and great discomfort ANTON pulls the
MAN close to him takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the
MANS rope

ANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on
ANTONS rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half

ANTON
Arghhh

VALENTINA
Youve done it Brilliant

ANTON
Argggg

PERCY
Come on dont hang about Were
getting soaked up here

EXT PAVEMENT ON BLACK FRIARS BRIDGE A LITTLE LATER 28

VALENTINA ANTON and PERCY manhandle the MAN over the parapet
and onto the pavement

DR PARNASSUS has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon
Soaked Hes drunk and is swaying

DR PARNASSUS
Why are you fishing dead people out
of the river Hes dead Leave him
Lets go Before the police turn
up

He goes unsteadily back inside

VALENTINA and ANTON drag the MAN under the wagon out of the
rain

The MAN is dressed in an expensive Saville Row suit His
jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols
have been scrawled on his forehead Hes about 30 years old
and very handsome

The MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the
kiss of life

ANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the
kiss of life and he pulls her away

ANTON
No That wont work And anyway
you d-dont know where hes b-been
Let me

He brings both fists down hard on the centre of the MANS
chest

Boing The “dead MAN coughs sits bolt upright spits out a
little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of
the wagon knocking himself out
The little metal tube clatters over the asphalt

ANTON (CONTD)
Hes alive

VALENTINA
Thank God

PERCY
Well he was

ANTON picks up the little metal tube and examines it
ANTON
What on earth is this
29 EXT BLACK FRIARS BRIDGE REAR OF WAGON MOMENTS LATER

Put him in the big trunk

ANTON
B-but
VALENTINA

PERCY

The boss said leave him

29 29

VALENTINA
He thought he was dead
They start to bundle the MAN in one of the travelling trunks
attached to the back of the wagon With the body hanging
half in half out ANTON suddenly stops

ANTON
I d-dont like it Its none of our
b-business

VALENTINA
So what do you suggest we leave
him on the side of the road

ANTON doesnt want to answer that one
PERCY
(walking away)
Definitely
VALENTINA single-handedly hefts the MAN into the trunk and

carefully places a cushion under his head An action not
missed by ANTON

30 EXT DERELICT BUILDINGS DAWN 30

The wagon stands hidden among deserted derelict buildings
All is quiet

The lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens

The MAN struggles out His neck is sore his wrists ache and
his head is bruised He hasnt a clue where he is He tries
to make sense of the wagon the grazing horses the derelict

buildings

Some distance away a bizarre horned and tailed CREATURE is
involved in a strange contorted dance

Hoping to avoid the CREATURE the MAN starts to move away but
is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him

PERCY (V0O)
Hey you

The MAN turns around to find PERCY looking at him
PERCY (CONTD)
I suppose somebody saves your life
everyday of the week

him off and find the phone himself The phone is retrieved
but in the struggle to answer it its dropped

A WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN can be heard from the phone As

ANTON and the MAN dive for it the MAN ‘accidently steps on

ANTON and PERCY glare with deep suspicion at the MAN
DR PARNASSUS (0S)

details - a noose strangely marked shapes like bricks a
metal tube - to the objects found on the MAN

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
The hanged man

VALENTINA(OS)

CUT TO ANTON who is painting a long-stemmed wooden
flowerhe comes over to VALENTINA with it in his hand

VALENTINA
(looking away)
Dont talk to me

ANTON
P-pleaseIm sorry about last

VALENTINA

ANTON suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud
Then spins flips the flower high into the air and rolling
face down onto his stomach catches the stem with his
clenched buttocks VALENTINA bursts out laughing

ANTON
You must admit even idiots have
their qualities

CUT TO GEORGE who is peeling potatoes badly PARNASSUS and
PERCY come up behind him

DOCTOR PARNASSUS

PERCY produces a small contraption with wires from behind his
back and gives it to DR PARNASSUS

42 42

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Hold this piece of wire

PERCY
You wont feel a thing

GEORGE takes the end of the wire
DOCTOR PARNASSUS

DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
I want you to relax and try as far
as possible to think of nothing

GEORGE

DOCTOR PARNASSUS closes his eyes He seems to be making an
effort

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Hold your breath

GEORGE does so

DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
Very good very good Yes Yes I

DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes his hand from GEORGES head and gives
the contraption back to PERCY

The effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS He needs to sit

down

VALENTINA and ANTON begin to pay attention and gather around

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
And you used to do good works

Something to do with charity I
think

TONY
YesThats right Thats right
But how

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(dismissively)
Its an ancient technique of mental
divination but Im very rusty and
it doesnt always work
satisfactorily

TONY
But thats amazing Brilliant
(oddly concerned)
Was there anything else

DOCTOR PARNASSUS shakes his head no

PARNASSUS

TONY (CONTD)
(relieved)
Thats absolutely fantastic Thank
you Perhaps Ill remember other
things

smiles and bows slightly ironically

VALENTINA
Charity work I knew you were a
good person

PERCY
So what was he doing dangling under
a bridge from his neck

VALENTINA
Percy

PERCY
(sarcastic)
Oh dear was that a rude question
Have I put my foot in it

TONY

Thats so strange And horrible
its a complete blank But I do
remember I was involved in some
sort of charity trying to do
good to make the world a better
place you knowinspire people
give them hope

(self deprecatingly)
What an arrogant idiot

VALENTINA looks at him thinking ‘what a sympathetic person

The sound of a flutey whistle distracts him ANTON is blowing
a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge

TONY (CONTD)
Whats that

ANTON
(with a superior air)
Mozarts flute concerto in G

TONY
I mean the pipe Where did you get

it

ANTON looks at the metal pipe

ANTON

I found it
TONY

ANTON

Oh Youre a musician n-now

TONY

I have it Please

ANTON
(teasing)
Are you s-sure its yours

TONY
Positive

ANTON
Alright

ANTON appears to offer the pipe to TONY but palms it so that
when TONY reaches out to take it its gone

ANTON (CONTD)
Its g-gone

TONY
(getting shirty)
Dont fool around

ANTON
Ah there it is

TONY once more tries to take it Once more ANTON makes it
disappear

TONY
(angry)
Give it to me

ANTON
(derisively)
Oooooh
VALENTINA

Anton thats enough

She steps forward takes the pipe from ANTON and gives it to
TONY

TONY
Thank you

DR PARNASSUS whos been watching this exchange looks
thoughtful

EXT THE WAGON NIGHT 43
PARNASSUS and CO are preparing to move out and do a show

ANTON is working near PARNASSUS and PERCY who are unaware of
his presence

DR PARNASSUS
Whats eating Anton

ANTON pricks up his ears

PERCY
Hes in love with Valentina

DR PARNASSUS
(dumbfounded)

PERCY
It happens

DR PARNASSUS
The little snake Ill skin him

CUT TO ANTON who winces

PERCY
While youre at it dont forget

DR PARNASSUS looks at PERCY questioningly
PERCY (CONTD)

DR PARNASSUS
Quite another kettle of fish

PERCY

DOCTOR PARNASSUS

PERCY
(ironic)

souls

DR PARNASSUS
I think he might Valentina sees

PERCY
Shed be better off with Anton

CUT TO ANTON whos pleased

DR PARNASSUS

Perhaps I should offer her hand to
whoever helps most in winning the
next five souls

CUT TO ANTON who looks puzzled
PERCY

Thats even worse than the other
ideas youve had today

DR PARNASSUS
(sighs)
Youre not wrong Ah Percy what
would I do without you

PERCY
Get a midget

CUT TO ANTON as he moves thoughtfully away

EXT OUTSIDE PUB NIGHT 44
The theatre parked outside a pub is up and running
ANTON as Mercury is doing his pitch

ANTON
Sleep no more Procrastinate no
longer Embrace this once in a life-
time opportunity Let the mind of
Doctor Parnassus be the portal to
the infinite world of your

imagination

Behind the curtain PERCY is signalling VALENTINA to see if
DOCTOR PARNASSUS has been drinking She sniffs him

44

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
What are you doing Please
concentrate Weve got a tremendous
amount of work to do tonight A
great deal depends on it

A roll on the drums from PERCY The curtain rises DOCTOR
PARNASSUS floats above the stage on his glass plinth

ANTON
As old as the universe itself the
great Doctor versed in every
mystic practice known to man and
many more besides will guide you
to your destiny

However the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who
have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - arent much
interested in ANTON Instead they pay more attention to the
masked TONY who decked out in a stylish costume is working
the sparse crowd with his smooth charm

ANTON irritated glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is
worried about the lack of customers

TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN They laugh at one
of his jokes One pretty young woman SALLY in particular
seems to be smitten by the handsome ‘actor TONY smiles
seductively at her

The sight provokes ANTON He leaps off the stage grabs SALLY
by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage

PERCY keeps playing
SALLY
(laughing)
What Hey what you doing

ANTON
T-taking you to the heart of your
imagination

ANTON is trying to compete with TONY but just cant manage
the charm

SALLY
(good humoured)
Oh my god No way

ANTON
You wont regret it

44 44

FEMALE FRIEND
Go for it Sal

SALLY
(indicating friend)
Only if she comes with me

FEMALE FRIEND
(enthusiastic)
Now youre talking

A few ONLOOKERS cheer

ANTON
N-not at the same time

ANTON is still pulling SALLY onto the stage

SALLY
Im not going on my own

ANTON
Your imagination is a very special
place Doctor Parnassus will make
it flower

SALLY
I bet he will

More laughs

FEMALE FRIEND
Well do it together
More laughs

ANTON
(shakes his head)
No T-two c-competing imaginations
in the Imaginarium at the same
time its n-not advisable

FEMALE FRIEND
Eh

ANTON
The stronger imagination will
overcome the weaker and then
theres n-no knowing what might
happen

44 44

FEMALE FRIEND
Thats really stupid

fq

SALLY
Let go

ANTON
D-dont be afraid d-dear lady
Youll be safe with me

Anton sweeps her off her feet and carries her onto the stage

SALLY
Put me down

ANTON
Have no fear

FEMALE FRIEND
She doesnt want to do it on her
own

ANTON
Only b-because she d-doesnt

realize

FEMALE FRIEND
Let go of her you silly pillock

VALENTINA worried steps forward to try and restrain ANTON

VALENTINA
Anton

ANTON
Its alright Its alright

Staggering under the weight of the struggling SALLY ANTON
barges into DOCTOR PARNASSUS on his glass plinth

The plinth rocks and teeters VALENTINA tries to stop it
falling

ANTON unaware of what hes done disappears through the
mirror as DOCTOR PARNASSUS crashes head first onto the stage
Crack

From behind the mirror comes the sound of a womans
terrifying terrified screams 44

FEMALE FRIEND
SALLY Theyve got her in there
Thats her screaming SAL They
doing something to her SALLY
Help somebody Help Save her

Upstage VALENTINA tends the stunned DOCTOR He clutches his
head in pain

VALENTINA
Father Father
INTEXT THE MIND OF DR PARNASSUS THAT MOMENT 45

Terrified ANTON and the screaming SALLY are spun through a
black void clinging desperately to an asteroid as planets and

stars spin madly around them

Blood-red lightning bolts crackle and crash Chaos

EXT OUTSIDE PUB THAT MOMENT 46

Out front the CROWD larger now is reacting badly to the
dreadful screams Sallys friends try to storm the stage

TONY and PERCY try to hold them back
TONY
Please Everythings alright Its
okay Really I promise you

A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN hits him with her handbag

TONY and PERCY are in danger of being overwhelmed We can
still hear Sally screaming from somewhere within the stage

TONY (CONTD)
Ladies and gentlemen Ladies and

gentlemenplease

A DRUNK takes a swing at PERCY misses and connects with
TONY

TONY (CONTD)
Ugh

He falls off the stage and disappears into the angry CROWD
who begin pummelling and kicking him

46
PERCY desperate produces a pistol and fires a couple of
shots into the air

EVERYONE dives for cover

PERCY taking advantage of the temporary lull begins to race
around untying unhooking and pulling on ropes

The theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the

wagon clatters off down the street bits falling off as it
goes

VOICE IN CROWD
Somebody call the police

A battered TONY chased by the enraged crowd just manages to
clamber on board with the help of VALENTINA

The wagon narrowly succeeds in out-pacing the fastest of the
CROWD As it disappears down the street a figure is dumped
unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon

Its the terrified SALLY sent sprawling in the middle of the
road

A figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet
Its MR NICK in his bowler and red waistcoat

EXT RUBBISH TIP NIGHT 47

A police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the
corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt the
horses steaming sections of the theatre hanging loose
brokenan utter mess The siren fades into the distance

INTEXT THEATREWAGON NIGHT 48

Amongst collapsed scenery PARNASSUS lies in a heap The
others are struggling to their feet ANTON is desperately
trying to do something useful to help PARNASSUS but
VALENTINA pushes him out of the way

VALENTINA
What were you thinking Look what
youve done Get out of the way
(appealing to Tony)
Tony

TONY battered and bleeding helps her lift PARNASSUS and
manoeuvre him to his room

48

ANTON is mortified PERCY pats him on the back
PERCY
Better luck next time

49 INT PARNASSUS ROOM NIGHT
TONY helps VALENTINA get PARNASSUS comfortable

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(babbling)
This is my punishment All is lost

Impossible Valentina First to

Valentina We are doomed

VALENTINA
(very concerned)
Ssshhhh Thanks Tony Leave us

TONY nods leaves slowly Listening

50 EXT WAGON NIGHT

PERCY is angrily banging about trying to repair the damage
ANTON is trying to help but is just getting in the way

PERCY
Do me a favour Take a long walk
off a short pier

TONY arrives

TONY
Can I help

PERCY
Bugger off

TONY finds ANTON sitting despondently a short way from the
wagon swigging from a bottle He sits down next to him

ANTON
L-leave me alone

TONY
What were you doing to that girl
behind the mirror

ANTON
(incensed)
What are you suggesting

TONY
Oh cmonwe all heard her

ANTON

terrifying

TONY
Terrifying Why I dont

ANTON
(reluctantly)
No wellyou wouldnt Youve n-

mind control stuff is real

ANTON
You think its some k-kind of scam

ANTON

TONY

Hang on if he can really control
peoples minds why isnt he ruling
the world Why bother with this
crappy side show

ANTON

He d-doesnt want to rule the world
d-does he He wants the world to
rule itself

TONY
What a waste Tell me about the
mirror Whats the point of that
if not to razzle-dazzle the public 50
ANTON
(smiles sardonically)
Youre way off the mark
(taking a swig)
Its a b-bloody great mystery
wrapped in a b-brown p-paper b-bag
enemaor do I mean enigma
He pulls himself up and starts to stagger off
TONY
Er one more thingDoes first
to five mean anything to you
ANTON looks at TONY with loathing
ANTON
I thought you were the c-clever
one
He walks away into the darkness
TONY sits there busily thinking
EXT RUBBISH TIP DAWN 51

The morning light suffuses mountains of domestic refuse
Rubbish for as far as the eye can see Plastic sacks of
various colours many spilling open A few fires are burning

Flocks of scavenging sea gulls hover and dive screaming blue
murder

On one of the many pinnacles of garbage sits a lonely figure
Its ANTON depressed angry forlorn
The CAMERA SWINGS ROUND to show below ANTON in a valley of
waste material the wagon

52 EXT THE WAGON DAWN 52

PERCY has spread out the broken scenery assessing the damage
In the shadow of the wagon VALENTINA is changing TONYS

dressings
VALENTINA
Thank God its only cuts and
bruises I thought wed lost you

52 52
TONY
If you hadnt been there
He holds her hand Looks deep into her eyes
TONY (CONTD)
Valentina your father seems ina
terrible state Is it the police
The show Maybe I can help
VALENTINA
I dont know whats wrong with him
but if its about the showI
dont care Im tired of itlet
the police arrest us Im sick of
living like this
She looks miserable TONY puts his arms around her Holds

her tightly to him

TONY
Dont say that What youre doing
is important Really important
Its just maybe it should be
done in a different way

He is about to kiss her
DOCTOR PARNASSUS 0OS
What sort of different way do you
suggest

DR PARNASSUS grim faced head bandaged steps from behind
the wagon

TONY and VALENTINA quickly disengage

TONY
Oh hello good morning sir How
are you feeling That was a nasty
bump on the head you got

DOCTOR PARNASSUS 0OS
(beady eyed)
Different

TONY
Well sir Ive been thinking
Its clear the shows not
attracting many people Forgive me

but I see two ways of tackling
this problem
(MORE )
( )

52 52

TONY (CONTD)
Either the style of the show is at
fault or the type of audience I
would suggest changing both

PERCY has appeared dragging a damaged flat

PERCY
Change the show Who the fizzing

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Shhh
He sits down heavily
TONY
Im sorry but youre not modern

People want modern Look

He holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of
beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical

setting He thumbs through more pages of dreamy images

From behind the wagon ANTON watches forlornly

unnoticed

PARNASSUS

TONY (CONTD)

This is modern It works Trust me
I understand this world

(with a wink)
This kind of mind control Lets
try to meet the public halfway
the right public and in a better
part of town

by the others

PERCY
What about the filth

TONY
(puzzled)
What

PERCY
The filth The police

TONY
Therell be a better class of
police too

PERCY
Thatll be the day

TONY
The trick is not to hide Change
your colours Be bold Go where
they would least expect to find
you I think we have been brought
together for a reason I dont
believe in coincidence You saved
my life Now let me do something
in return

confers with PERCY

Alone and

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Our times nearly up This could
be what we need

TONY
(to Valentina)
This can be my birthday gift to
Valentina

VALENTINA smiles and nods to PARNASSUS

DR PARNASSUS
Well then
(with a burst of energy)
For Gods sake lets do it

PERCY
(sighs)
Yeah okay but what exactly do we
do
TONY
Well First of all I want you to

give me your money All of it
What PARNASSUS PERCY and VALENTINA look at each other
Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagonANTON
downcast heading off through the swirling plastic bags and

flying rubbish a battered suitcase in his hand

DR PARNASSUS
Anton Where are you going

No answer from ANTON

VALENTINA runs after him but he marches on silently 52

VALENTINA
What are you doing Didnt you do
enough damage last night
(pummmelling his back)
Anton Im the one who wants to

run away

(he slows)
Are you trying to wreck my
birthday or what

Anton stops still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops
his suitcase

VALENTINA (CONTD)
Please We need you

Moved ANTON turns to her She smiles sweetly

VALENTINA (CONTD)
How much money have you got

EXT BOND STREET EVENING 53

Close up on Parnassuss glass plinthnow open-topped and
sitting on the edge of the stage full of the troupes
savings A sign proclaims Please Take Generously

Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the
continent of Africa featured Sitting on top is Percy
playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one
handhis other is held out pathetically a beggar Hes
blacked up and dressed in rags He doesnt look happy He
sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money

The wagon newly painted in sleek and stylish black and
white stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable
street with expensive shops and art galleries RICH WOMEN
anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth
glide past

New signs proclaim “The Choice Is Yours “The Imaginarium -
More Exclusive than ever

The stage hung with softflowing gauzy fabric has been
chromatically divided in half - one side black the other
white

On the dark side a bloated sun-glassed woman consuming vast

quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge She is
in fact a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag

Center stage stands DR PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized
doctor with head reflector In his hand is a staff with an
elaborate sun on the top He is blindfolded

On the white side of the stage stands the mirror anda
stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples Under the
tree and reflected in the mirror sits VALENTINA as
Evenaked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty
She gracefully combs her hair

Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming The Naked Truth

DR PARNASSUS peeking under his blindfold is distinctly
uncomfortable by his daughters lack of attire

TONY in a beautifully cut white suit and wearing his
“romantic Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy
pose on the edge of the white side of the stage

Nobody speaks They pay no attention to the crowd

A few women stop curious One of them takes out some money
and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go

TONY
(retrieving the money)
Excuse me madam Im afraid we
cant accept this

The woman stops confused Tony hands her back her money

TONY (CONTD)

We are here to givenot take We
are here to help those in need If
its money you need then here it
is

(referring to the glass

plinth)
If its the flowering of the soul
you need then here we are but
unfortunately we are booked solid
at the moment But thank you I
can see you have a generous spirit

TONY returns to his pensive pose The women look at each
other

The women

WOMAN
Excuse me but how does this work
What does it cost

TONY
Cost Money is no good in the
Imaginarium This is a refuge for

hearts in need of truth A place
for souls to be purified

WOMAN 2
How long does that take Im
running late

TONY
Madam why should you care about
time What are your dreams worth in
minutes

grow pensive

TONY (CONTD)
There are hard choices to be made
in life

(he indicates the

tableaux)

What about the dreams of the less
fortunate in the world Do you
have time for their dreams Or are
you like I once wasdo you just
despair Despair at all that is
wrong in the world

(getting to his feet)
despair at your inability to do
anything to change it to make it
betterI despaired so much at the
powerlessness of my own existence
that I took the easy way outthe
cowards wayI committed suicide
Yes thats right I killed myself
Can you understand my despair But
I was savedsaved by a
miracleThe Imaginariumand

Doctor Parnassus He brought me
back from the dead He gave me a
new life A reason to live He has
given me power to dream again to
dream of a better world

During his speech more and more people have gathered Some
are actually weeping They are press forward putting money
in the plinth Tony tries to stop them but they insist
VALENTINA ANTON PERCY and DR PARNASSUS are astonished by
TONYS performance 53

VOICES IN CROWD
Stop pushingExcuse me can one
make a bookingAre you taking
bookingsStop pushing at the
backForm a queue

TONY
Please Im sorry but were booked
solid at the moment

A Louis Vuitton-dressed woman (60 years old)at the back of
the crowd shouts

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
Is that child up for adoption

She points at the blacked up PERCY

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONTD)
I want to adopt that unfortunate
black child It shouldnt be
working like this It should be in
school

PERCY is appalled

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONTD)
Whos in charge here

The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN looks around as a couple of POLICE
OFFICERS arrive on the scene

TONY spots them too and heads off the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN as
she makes towards them

TONY
Madam congratulations you have
been chosen

The other WOMEN gasp

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
What

TONY
Come forward and enter the
Imaginarium

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
But I havent paid 53

TONY
We dont want your money We want
your hopes and dreams You may make
a donation later if you wish

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
But

TONY
This is a rare moment Very few are
chosen Dont miss this once-in-a-
life-time opportunity This way
Please

He ushers the uneasy LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN onto the stage and
guides her upstage PARNASSUS goes into his trance

TONY (CONTD)
Believe me Madam youre the
luckiest woman in the world

The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN steps into the mirror TONY
hesitatesa moment of uncertainty VALENTINA encourages him

with a smile He steps through
Across the street a clock begins striking the hour

CUT TO the two POLICE OFFICERS who start to move the crowd
and show on

POLICEMAN
Alright I think its time to move
on folks

But on spotting the naked VALENTINA who winks at them they
agree between themselves to give the show a bit longer

INTEXT IMAGINARIUM 54

TONY and THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN are astonished to find
themselves in the romantic soft-focus pastel-colour setting
of a soothing sophisticated shampoo commercial

Soft fabrics waft cleansing waterfalls cascade rose-petals
float through the air beautiful girls swing from swings
attached to clouds - all in delicious slow motion

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
(overcome)
Oh how gorgeous

54

THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN takes TONYS hand and looks at him
meaningfully

TONY disorientated takes a moment to regain his composure
He smiles and with an effort puts his arm around THE LOUIS
VUITTON WOMANS wide waist He looks into her eyes Shes in
love

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONTD)
(moans softly)
Ohhh What bliss and I dont
even know your name

TONY
Tony

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
Tony How dashing

A bar or two of tango encourages them to take a couple of
intimate tango dance steps

Now gently wafting curtains part to reveal down a flower
strewn path and over a bridge a sleazy motel with a
shingle over the door reads The One Night Stand Motel In
the office window sits MR NICK

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONTD)
Oh goodness me

She bats her eyelashes at TONY and begins knowingly to pull
him towards the motel

TONY
(resisting)
If Im not wrong I fear you must
go alone

THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN pouts playfully pulling him onwards

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
Why would I want to go without you
darling

TONY
Its one of the rules One
imagination at a time free from
the influence of another

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN

(petulant)
Boring
( ) 54

They have reached the bridge Stairs descend to a stream

TONY
Ohlook another possibility

Below them a gondola rests in the stream as small flower
bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic

heroes who died young Keats Shelly Byron James Dean
Rudolph Valentino Marilyn Monroe Buddy Holly
Diana the stream continues off into the distance to a
dark towering Egyptian pyramid

TONY is as bemused as THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN

TONY (CONTD)
You must make a choiceand
actually to be honest Id
strongly recommend this one

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN

But Rudolph Valentino James
Dean Princess Di all these
people theyre dead

TONY

(thinking fast)
Exactly To be reborn first you
must die All of them have achieved
a kind of immortality And we love
them all the more for it They
wont get old or fat They wont
get sick or feeble They are beyond
fear They are forever young They
are gods And you can join them

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
(softening)
Youre such a wonderful speaker

Princess

The gondola awaitswith a beautiful male model at the

helm THE

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN smiles at him

TONY
Theres not a moment to lose

But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them TONY

looking past the WOMANS shoulder

sees the dark waters of

the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBRA

that towers menacingly over them

HAT and its angry

Its wearing a BOWLER

TONY (CONTD)
But your sacrifice must be pure
You have to let go of all these
worldly goods

He helps THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN remove her necklace
earrings bracelets rings broach in double quick time and
guides her onto the gondola blowing a kiss after her

TONY (CONTD)
Remember nothing is permanent
not even death

He turns back to see the GIGANTIC KING COBRA shrinking back
below the bridge transforming itself back into the waters of
the stream From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope
At its end a hangmans noose

TONY stares at it darkly disconcerted

EXT STAGE EVENING 55

TONY re-enters the stage through the mirror looking at DR
PARNASSUS who has just come out of his trance with
astonishment

TONY
(gobsmacked)
That was so I had no idea
Its just incredible

-And then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour
realizing that only a few moments have passed since he
entered the mirror

TONY (CONTD)
-how do you do this

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(ignoring him and with a
big theatrical gesture)
Hooplah

The LOUIS VUITTON woman reappears sitting on a cut-out cloud
descending from the ceiling of the stage She looks radiant

She is weeping completely overcome by her experience
PARNASSUS steps forward and helps her to her feet She kisses
his hands in gratitude

55

LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
Thank you thank you that was so
beautiful I feel so thank you so
much

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(graciously)
Thank YOU dear Lady you give me
strength to continue

Born again tearful but transcendent the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque

TONY is frozen confused The crowd is still stunned by
the LOUIS VUITTON WOMANs transformation as she deposits the
cheque her handbag her expensive coat in the glass box and
glides benignly through the crowd which parts in awe

Pause and then the other WOMEN rush the stage Mayhem is
narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into
a more-or-less orderly queue

Across the street standing in the doorway of a shop selling
luxury goods is MR NICK He watches events intrigued

as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror and a
third they descend ecstatic emptying the contents of their
handbags their pearls earrings and diamond rings into the
glass box

TONY pays off the cops who move on

TONY getting more and more flamboyant forgets to lower his
mask each time he re-enters the stage And now a fourth woman
descends Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS

DR PARNASSUS
(aside to Percy)
One more to go and were free

DOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street smiles
holds up four fingers

MR NICK gives a little “Im not impressed smirk and turns
away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the
shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN all laden
with luxury shopping walk past

One of the RUSSIANS stopslooking at the showat TONY whose
mask is sitting on top of his head The leading RUSSIAN
pulls him on 55

VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN) SUBTITLED
CmonWhat are you watching that
crap for

SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)
(pointing at TONY)
Its him

VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN)
Who are you talking about
(following SERGEs pointed
finger)
Impossible

SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)
Im sure

They start pushing through the crowd

TONY reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage
looks up and sees the RUSSIANS heading through the crowd

Panic He pulls the mask down and begins to back up

But its too late theyve definitely seen him

He spins around and rockets upstage past DR PARNASSUS who
is deep into his trance

TONY dives through the mirror much to the amazement of
VALENTINA ANTON PERCY

The RUSSIANS chase after him shoving the queuing WOMEN
aside smashing the scenery and knocking ANTON into the
wings

INTEXT SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE 56

The RUSSIANS charge through the shampoo-commercial landscape
No TONY Just slo-mo fashion models and soft wafting fabrics
and aromatic breezes

VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN)
Where did he go

PIOTR (IN RUSSIAN)
You tell me It cant be him
Hes dead We killed him

SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)
So why did he run

GREGOR (IN RUSSIAN)
There he is

In the distance TONY is hiding behind some billowing fabric
On being spotted he takes off up a hill

he RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a solid
all - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid stride
ooking off to their right they see Tony heading up another
ill But as they rush in that direction another wall rises

p blocking them Again it is painted with a hill and TONY
rozen in midstride A third and fourth wall rise up
urrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS

OMS THREH

There is a cell door in one wall Like crazy animals they
start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it
down It wont budge

While the others batter the door GREGOR who has been
somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world sits
quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers

Exhausted the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground

GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and
exhales As he does the door swings open The other RUSSIANS

gape at him then barrel out the door

Outside is a new beautiful landscape - the sky dotted with
white fluffy clouds Extending from the ground to each cloud
is an incredibly long ladder On each ladder is a person
climbing upwards

The RUSSIANS spot Tony He is already a hundred feet up a
ladder and climbing

Unfortunately their way is blocked by an over-bright hyper-
active wide-eyed sales girl

SALES-GIRL
Hi Hello Todays special Reach
for the clouds Discover your true
potential Gift certificates are
available at

The RUSSIANS roughly shove her aside As they rush past
GREGOR pauses hands her his flowers

GREGOR
Relaxsmell the flowers 56

Reaching the base of TONYS ladder the RUSSIANS start
climbing

Seeing the threat TONY kicks hard and breaks the rungs below
him setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking
downward towards the RUSSIANS Snap Crack Rungs break in
their grasp they fall

The RUSSIANS land in a tangled heap as the domino effect
continues down to the base of the ladder

Laughing down at them TONY turns to continue climbing - only
to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the

ladder towards him

THE LADDER COMPLETELY SEPARATES IN TWO

fq

Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages

to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung Then as
if he were on giant stilts starts to stride away

The RUSSIANS chase after him but his giant strides leave
them far behind Smugly TONY looks back just as one of the
legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log He loses his
balance and plunges hundreds of feet earthward

From nowhere ANTON (still dressed as a fat woman) appears
running to catch the plummeting TONY He does and Whomp
is flattened Knocked out cold TONY is unscathed his fall
broken by ANTONS padding

But the RUSSIANS arrive grab TONY start to beat him up
SERGE
You thieving scumbag We break

every bone in your body

They scrawl strange symbols on TONYS forehead

TONY
No Wait I can explain Give me a
chance

VLADIMIR

We want our money or you die again
This time for good

ANTON struggles to his feet

ANTON
Stop it L-leave him alone

The RUSSIANS turn and thinking ANTON is a fat bossy middl
aged woman hesitate

ANTON (CONTD)
Stand b-back Im warning you

Foolishly he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial
arts pose The RUSSIANS look at each other Then utterly
ignoring ANTON turn their attention back to beating TONY

e-

GREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode

GREGOR
(bending down and picking
a flower he offers it to
ANTON)
Relax Smell the flowers

Confused ANTON takes the flower sniffs and then GREGOR
floors him with a powerful punch on the nose

Meanwhile the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONYs neck and
have looped the rope over a tree branch TONY struggles to
pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck
He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when

the ground erupts and a giant London policemans helmet
rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves -
revealing DR PARNASSUS carved and painted face beneath

The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a
welcoming red carpet From inside the giant mouth a smiling
policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in

The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope

TONY drops to the ground and with a whistle the brass pipe
flies out of his mouth

Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurlsit reads
JOIN THE FUZZ WE LOVE VIOLENCE and a chorus line of
LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear -
high-kicking a snappy song and dance number

The astonished RUSSIANS dont know what the fuck is going on

Suddenly a friendly OLD WOMANS VOICE is heard shouting
something in Russian

Spinning around the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian
grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to
them A stunned pause Then pell-mell they rush to her 56

RUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN)
Mama Mama Help Save us
As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller She
lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath And
then BOOM a muffled explosion balloons the skirts
outward Smoke spews out from below

Straightening her skirt the BABOUSHKA looks up and pulls
off her head - revealing MRNICKs tiny head poking out of
the collar He smiles smugly

The giant POLICEMAN DR PARNASSUS registers disappointment
and like a balloon rapidly deflating spins off into the sky
sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything

The dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves ina
desolate empty landscape Nowhere Nothing

TONY
Did you see me I almost reached
the clouds I could haveit was
incredibleI was almost there

ANTON

Shut up

Over a distant rise the wagon appears pulled by the horses
ANTON drags Tony babbling and stumbling towards it

TONY
I made my choice and I climbed I
felt so much potential I could
have done anything I have to have
another chanceanother goI
need this

EXT SOMEWHERE DOWN RIVER - MUD FLATS EVENING 57

The wagon is parked on waste ground It looms out of nowhere
illuminated by a light leaking from within

We hear PERCYS angry voice

PERCY 0S
Maybe you were holding them upside
down

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
What

57
PERCY
That cards The bloody Tarot cards
DOCTOR PARNASSUS 0OS
(distraught and angry)
Enough Percy Enough
TONY 0S
I made a mistake A big mistake I
know that and Im sorry
INT THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS 58

The angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and
jumbled scenery TONY is on trial

DR PARNASSUS is sitting in a corner head in hands He seems
utterly destroyed

ANTON
Youre a l-liar Youve been lying
to us all along Who are you Who
were those thugs

TONY
I am not a liar

ANTON

TONY
No I just didnt divulge
everything I knew

PERCY
Comes to the same thing

TONY
Absolutely not Not in law

ANTON
You stole their money

TONY
No I didnt
ANTON
Thats what they said

58 58

TONY
Are you going to believe them
before you believe me

PERCY
Why not

TONY
Because theyre irredeemably bad
people and Im essentially good I
know that sounds terribly prim and
arrogant and self righteous but
Im trying to be honest Look the

truth is in order to get my
charity off the ground I needed
capital

ANTON looks askance

TONY (CONTD)

(in response to Anton)
Yes I know and youre right but
thats the way the grown-upthe
real world works You cant make
omelettes without soiling your
hands Or should that be the other
way round Anyway I - with
hindsight very foolishly - accepted
a loan from people who seemed to
me at the time to be very decent
and sincere There was absolutely
no way I could have known that they
were part of a ruthless organised
crime syndicate and that they
wanted to use my charity to launder
money I made a mistake And I have
to live with that Im sorry What
more can I say

VALENTINA

wants to believe TONY ANTON and PERCY dont

VALENTINA
(distressed but basically
sympathetic)
Oh Tony
TONY
But can we not talk about me for a
moment I want to thank the Doctor

for letting me experience the most
sublime inspiring 58

ANTON
So why were they trying to k-kill
you Again is what they said

TONY
What
ANTON
(answering his own
question)
The first time they hung you from
the b-bridge right B-because

you stole their money

TONY
Stop saying that I didnt steal
it I didnt have it Id had to
invest in infrastructure I needed
more time When you run a charity
you have to give lots of money
away You wouldnt believe the red
tape The Charity Commission are a
bunch of fascists Its incredible

I mean cmon give me a breakI
almost died today and I said Im
sorry and anyway this was

supposed to be a special dayits

Valentinas birthday

He pulls out the LOUIS VUITTON WOMANS beautiful necklace
from his pocket
TONY (CONTD)
Happy birthday For a beautiful
woman

He puts it around Valentinas neck VALENTINA smiles ANTON
glowers

ANTON

TONY

forehead Symbols Signs

TONY looks uncomfortable tries to rub his forehead clean

PERCY
You had some of those when we
rescued you

ANTON
Yes whats that about

But before he can say anything theres a knock on the door
which startles everyone They exchange looks

DR PARNASSUS is frightened but hides this from the others
The knock is repeated PERCY starts to get up
DR PARNASSUS
(sotto voce)
No Leave it
PERCY sits down

The knock comes again

VALENTINA

(sotto voce to the DR
PARNASSUS)
Who is it

DR PARNASSUS
(sotto voce)
Its too late for visitors

Once more someone knocks Everyone is edgy Particularly

PERCY
The knock comes again

PERCY

(sotto voce agitated)
Please can we answer the door I
cant stand not answering the door
or the telephone or whatever Its
not in my nature I wont sleep for
weeks if we dont answer the door
Sorry

DR PARNASSUS gets up goes to the door opens it and steps

outside closing the door behind him

VALENTINA ANTON PERCY and TONY exchange looks

PERCY (CONTD)
(embarrassed)
Sorry I just Ive got a thing

EXT OUTSIDE THE WAGON THAT MOMENT

DR PARNASSUS and MR NICK move away from the door and go

around to the front The stage is half-opened
The horses are standing steaming nearby

DR PARNASSUS

MR NICK
Four rotten Russkies

DR PARNASSUS
And the girlfrom the pub

MR NICK shakes his head

MR NICK
Sally doesnt count Do you gal

SALLY (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped
from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows puts her arms
around NICK

DR PARNASSUS
Youre joking toying with me
Like a cat with a mouse As is
your privilege

MR NICK
Sal didnt get to make a real
choice You were gaga Out for the

He smiles lights a cigarette takes a deep drag
MR NICK (CONTD)
Not quite

(checks his watch)
Ohoh look at the timeits 11

59
and he wanders off into the darkness with SALLY
Somewhere a clock strikes 11
DR PARNASSUS agitated watches him go

VALENTINA (VO)
Father

DR PARNASSUS looks round to find VALENTINA standing next to
him He starts to round up the horses

DOCTOR PARNASSUS

DOCTOR PARNASSUS

There are more important things at

VALENTINA

PARNASSUS sighs Stops He checks his watch

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Yes

VALENTINA
So tell me

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
What I told you was the truth

I have been immortal I have been
mortal And I have had many
dealings with the devil Too many

VALENTINA
(fearful)

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Remember the woman I was telling
you about the one I was so
desperately in love with so in
love that I made a deal with the
devil That was your mother
she was so beautiful so
enchantingso

Looking at VALENTINA DR PARNASSUS sees her morph into the
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing He almost swoons

DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
so young She was everything I
had ever dreamed of I made a
choice I bargained away my
immortality I regained my youth
and I won her I did I won her

The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN morphs back into VALENTINA

DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
but at a price

DR PARNASSUS looks haggard He closes his eyes He sways and
loses his balance

VALENTINA

VALENTINA 59

stops him from falling

VALENTINA
What price

DR PARNASSUS
(anguished)
Its too terrible

VALENTINA
Tell me

DR PARNASSUS

VALENTINA

on one of the newspapers Stops

EXT THE WAGON A LITTLE LATER 62
PARNASSUS a bottle in his hand is lurching around

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
You fool You monstrous fool You

He starts to violently bang his head against the side of the
wagon

Suddenly the stage begins to unfold PARNASSUS looks up
unable to see what or who is doing this He drunkenly
stumbles around the side to see TONY pulling ropes

DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONTD)

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(befuddled)

inability to go into a
trance)

Why not Whats wrong

mirror)

TONY leaps back to steady DR PARNASSUS who looked as though
he were about to topple off his pillar

TONY (CONTD)
Oh God Doctor We can save

PARNASSUS quiets down Starts mumbling

TONY rushes to the mirror Steps through He finds himself
standing amongst the stage scenery Nothing else

TONY (CONTD)

Bugger
He steps back out of the mirror Goes to PARNASSUS who is
weeping

DR PARNASSUS

TONY shakes him hard
TONY
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER Sir

PARNASSUS slowly goes into a sobbing kind of trance state

TONY confirms he is in a trance then rushes to the mirror
VALENTINA OS

huddles VALENTINA sobbing

VALENTINA
(sobbing)
Its useless Hopeless I

VALENTINA grateful clings to TONY

62 TONY (CONTD)

TONY
Cmon then

They turn to the mirror but an off-stage clearing of the
throat makes them look round to see ANTON watching them Hes
holding a torn and dirty piece of newspaper

ANTON
Ah there you are Tony Heres
something m-might interest you
(reading)
Missing D-disgraced head of

TONY
No

TONY tries to snatch the paper but ANTON steps back

ANTON

PARNASSUS is still in his trance but mumbling

arrested last week on charges of

TONY
(to Valentina)
Valentina Dont listen to that
Im innocent This is the work of
people who are trying to destroy
me Evil people Believe me Look

TONY pulls VALENTINA towards the mirror 62

ANTON tries to stop him but TONY pushes him back off the
stage He crashes to the ground

TONY (CONTD)
(grabbing VALENTINA)
Hurry

TONY and VALENTINA disappear through the mirror

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(sobbing in his trance)
Valentina Forgive me

INTEXT DR PARNASSUS DRUNKEN IMAGINATION

Mist and rain descend as TONY and VALENTINA run through the
darkened shapes of the shampoo-commercial landscape - now
tattered ragged and wind blown Darkness reigns

TONY
This isnt right This is all
wrong Which way

Soaked and cold they spy a welcome sight A uniformed valet
with an open umbrella stands by the door of a sleek limo

VALET
Your car is here MrTony

TONY
Ah Lester just in time

TONY ducks under the umbrella and helps VALENTINA into the
car ahead of himself

As she slides across the seat she notices the driver - bowler
hatted and smoking a cigarette

VALENTINA
No Tony dont get in Get away

She pushes TONY back and scrambles outdragging him back
out into the dark rain

The driver turns around Its MRNICK looking vexed

VALENTINA and TONY struggle through the rain Suddenly they

find themselves in deep water up to their chests They are
sinking Through the mist they see a boat It is the gondola
that transported the LOUIS VUITTON LADY

63

TONY
Help Over here

The boatman turns the boat in their direction TONY tries to
pull himself on board The boatman reaches down to help

BOATMAN
Give me your hand

Its MR NICK VALENTINA recoils drags TONY off the boat
TONY
Stop What are you doing Well
drown
VALENTINA

No we wont This is the way

She points to jumbled rocks just visible in the darkness
They drag themselves onto them The rocky monoliths appear
to be the same as the landscape ANTON climbed over when he
was searching for DIEGO the son of THE FAMILY FROM HELL

And like a repeat of that experience from behind the ridge
rises the Parnassus-faced Mongolfier balloon But now the
eyes stream tears and rain pours down In the basket is
ANTON

ANTON
Dont d-do it Dont g-go on Not
with him Hes all lies

VALENTINA
Just like my father Leave me
alone I dont care anymore I want
a new life

TONY
Valentina

He pulls her awaytowards a little tumble-down cottage Warm
candlelight glows in the windows smoke curls from the
chimney They run to the door TONY bangs on it Someone

can be heard unlatching the locks inside

A childs crying cuts through the wind
VALENTINA turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path

among flapping laundry She rushes to her tries to pick her
up but the little girl resists 63
VALENTINA
Tony help me shes heavy
The door has just opened and TONY is halfway through He

turns irritated

TONY
What is it now Cant we just go
inside and get dry

Behind him in the warmth stands the old BABOUSHKA

Seeing that VALENTINA is really struggling with the little
girl TONY reluctantly goes to help The little girl on
seeing TONY tries to break away but he holds on to her

TONY (CONTD)
(shouting angrily)
Ostanobuite bas menshi schit

The litle girl goes quiet VALENTINA looks at TONY with
surprise The BABOUSHKA looks angry Suddenly a light begins
to suffuse TONY and the little girl A small orchestra can
be heard playing garden party music

VALENTINA
You did it You made the right
choice

The light fills the screen and we find

TONY sleekly groomed and immaculately dressed holding
the smiling little girl She too has been cleaned and
buffed The sun shines He stands in

girl)

phrase

to fall apart literally

The floor around TONY falls away into an abyss leaving only a
narrow escape route He hurls ANTON aside and dashes away as

the GUESTS pursue him ANTON avoids being trampled but
loses his footing and falls over the edge

VALENTINA
Anton

VALENTINA fighting through the angry GUESTS rushes to the

edge of the abyss ANTON is struggling to hold on to a

broken floor joist that protrudes several feet down from the

side of the cliff face

ANTON
Valentinahelp me Please

His grip slips VALENTINA reaches for him grasps his hand

VALENTINA
Forgive me Anton I was wrong

ANTON
I know Im not a child

And ANTON REVERTS TO HIS NORMAL SIZEAND WEIGHT

ANTON (CONTD)
I love you Valentina

ANTON slips out of her grip plummeting into the abyss

VALENTINA
Noooo

Suddenly VALENTINA is jerked backwards by her hair

TONY
Whos behind this Eh You didnt

come up with this all on your own

(slapping her)
No Someones got at you Someones
paid you Who Tell me

DR PARNASSUS (0S)
Valentina My darling daughter
There you are 68

They turn to see PARNASSUS in the distance (where once the
ballroom stood) stumbling towards them drunk desperate As
he moves forward a new landscape is created behind him

TONY rushes towards PARNASSUS

TONY
You old bastard This is all your
doing
DR PARNASSUS
(drunkenly)
All my doing Im merely the

facilititatater dear boy

GUESTS (0S)
There he is Stop him Leave her
alone Get him

Throwing his arm around TONY PARNASSUS spins him around to
face the MOB rushing towards him

DR PARNASSUS
I create the opportunities Is it
my fault if your not up to it

Tony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken
DOCTOR right into the path of the frenzied MOB PARNASSUS is
trampled underfoot in their rush to catch TONY

VALENTINA
Father No

PARNASSUSS body lies broken on the ground Frantically

VALENTINA rushes to him throwing herself on her fathers
battered body sobbing hysterically

VALENTINA (CONTD)
NONO NO Please fatherits
all my fault What have I done

With siren wailing an AMBULANCE arrives screeching to a
halt PARAMEDICS pull VALENTINA away They check PARNASSUS
for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney
VALENTINA cant control herself and tries to throw herself
onto his body The PARAMEDICS struggle with her

PARAMEDIC
(with a severe stutter)
P-p-p-lease m-mis-s theres-s
n-n-othing y-y-y-you c-can d-d-o
he-he-hes d-d-dead 68

VALENTINA
NOOOOO

VALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an
animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC
can finish speaking

PARAMEDIC
d-dead drunk

A bottle falls from the DOCTORS hand and explodes in a
million fragments as it hits the ground

The shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror
corridor down which a multi-reflected VALENTINA runs -
sobbing like a madwoman - lashing out at her reflections
some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with TONY
irritated with ANTON angry with PARNASSUS

VALENTINA
(to her reflections)
You little fool Youre to blame
for everything I hate you

The multi-reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two
mirrors identical to the one used in the Imaginarium The one

to the left is marked His with a bowler hat the other to
the right Hers with a bonnet She hesitates

VALENTINA (CONTD)
(laughing madly)
So this is to be my choice

MR NICK appears out of the His mirror - a burst of flame
behind him

He makes a sweeping gesture inviting VALENTINA to enter the
mirror marked Hers

VALENTINA heads for the mirror marked His MR NICK blocks
her path

MR NICK
Now theres absolutely no need for
that Thats just plain
contrariness

VALENTINA tries to get around him 68

MR NICK (CONTD)
You think you deserve punishment
but youre a kid - you have no
ideatrust me

VALENTINA feints another direction MR NICK blocks her

VALENTINA
(a crazed look)
Wrong Im 16Im a woman now
She spins around himhe blocksa kind of dance between

them begins - confusingly reflected in the mirrors A tango
can be heard

VALENTINA (CONTD)
a selfish bitch everyone I love
diesIm

MR NICK

only fit for hell If only

He looks at Valentina with lascivious intent Hes tempted
briefly but resists it

MR NICK (CONTD)
No your pop would never speak to
me again And thatd be a shame
Lets dance

Reflected in the swirling mirror fragments they tango until
he spins her towards the right hand mirror She sails through
- and with a mad smile throws hima kiss

The mirror closes with a burst of flame The briefest flash
of DR PARNASSUS face is reflected in the mirror fragments

DOCTOR PARNASSUS 0S
MR NICK turns realizing he has been looking into a mirror

fragment reflecting the two mirrors The writing on the
Valentinas mirror reads His

MR NICK
Damn Ive won

EXT STRANGE MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE 69

DR PARNASSUS is sitting alone on a prominent bluff (the same
one he tried throwing himself off many years ago) Hes
distraught Tears run down this cheeks A distant bell tolls
midnight

MR NICK appears behind PARNASSUSsits down beside him

MR NICK
Funny how things work out isnt
it

He lights a cigarette

MR NICK (CONTD)
Its not what I had in mind
yknow this Valentina being
the fifth It doesnt seem
right Shes supposed to be the
prize the star prize not part
of the bloody score And you
lumbered with eternal life all over
again What a bummer eh

No response from PARNASSUS A Tarot cards drops from his
hand It is The Hanged Man

MR NICK points to the plain far below Across the harsh
ground TONY is running for his lifepursued by the MOB

MR NICK (CONTD)

I hope they get that bastard Tear
him limb from limb But they
wont He leads a charmed life
that one Ive been trying to
nail him for years I thought I
had him this time But theres
always some prat comes to his
rescue Talk about the luck of
the Devil

(he laughs)
Those weird markings you found on
him on his forehead Those
satanic-symbol so-called
things Whats all that about
Maybe they protect him in some
way Ive never been into that
black-magic stuff myself Cant
seem to get the hang of it I
know pathetic isnt it

69 69

PARNASSUS ignores him sunk even deeper into despondency

MR NICK (CONTD)
God I hate to see you like this
Look I tell you what If you can
get the lowdown on those satanic
markings or wait better
still if you can wipe that self-
righteous little creep off the face
of the universe Ill give you
Valentina back

A beat Slowly PARNASSUS looks up

MR NICK (CONTD)
How about it

EXT SOMEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN 70

TONY sweating panting for breath is running up the
mountain

Below the MOB is still in hot pursuit

TONY reaches the summit In front of him is his salvation -
an empty gibbet A noose hangs from the crossbeam

TONY
Thank God for that

TONY relaxes a little

We can hear the mob now struggling up the mountain
TONY digs into one of his pockets and pulls out the brass
tube that he has always kept close

TONY opens his mouth and is about to slip the tube down his
throat when he spots the Hanged Man Tarot card lying at his
feet A hand from behind him snatches the tube away

TONY startled turns to find himself looking up at DR
PARNASSUS

PARNASSUS is standing on a chair with the noose around his
neck He smiles and opens his hand The metal tube has
vanished

fq

TONY panics The MOB is getting closer

( )

70
With his other hand DR PARNASSUS produces the tube from

TONYS ear

TONY (CONTD)
(desperate)
Give me that
DR PARNASSUS gestures at the CROWD

DR PARNASSUS
Give us a moment please

The CROWD goes into very slow motionbut twice as angry
DR PARNASSUS teases TONY with magic

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
Heres your tube Heres mine
(producing a second tube)
But mines just a cheap
counterfeit Look it breaks
(he breaks it)
But heres another

TONY
Stop

DR PARNASSUS
Youre not amused

TONY

(desperate)
Youve been talking to the devil
havent you Let me guess what he

said If you manage to kill me
hell release Valentina Yes Am I
right I am arent I Its all

lies He cant release her And why
not Because he doesnt have her
He cant have her because shes the
prize

(gaining confidence)

He doesnt have five wins But if
you kill me he will wont he
Youll have lost Valentina forever

DR PARNASSUS does a double hand shuffle

DR PARNASSUS
Choose

70 70

TONY
This is ridiculous

DR PARNASSUS
Choose

TONY chooses

TONY
Youve got to believe me For all
our sakes

DR PARNASSUS
Are you sure you made the right
choice

TONY
Look

DR PARNASSUS
Lets find out

He slides the tube down his throat and kicks the chair away

He drops dangles from the ropethe noose tight around
his neck

At the same moment the MOB resumes normal speed and roars up
the mountain

Is PARNASSUS dead

Working very fast TONY hoists him over his shoulder and
wrestles the noose loose He drops PARNASSUS on the ground
Hes stunned but still alive

The MOB is closing in

TONY slaps DR PARNASSUS hard between the shoulder blades

The tube pops out of the DOCTORS gullet TONY catches it

TONY
Gotcha

TONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet
grabbing him beating him and then lifting him onto the
chair tightening the noose around his neck 70

Although battered TONY winks smugly at DR PARNASSUS but
his mood changes when he sees DR PARNASSUS spit out several
more fake tubes then gagging force the real one up and out
of his gullet

With a look of realization and horror TONY drops to his
death as the MOB kicks the chair away from under him

The MOB cheers Yes hes dead

DR PARNASSUS tosses the metal tube to MR NICK who steps
coolly out of the MOB cigarette in his mouth

DR PARNASSUS
(hoarsely)
There are three cardinal rules
One theres no black-magic only

cheap tricks And er I forget
the others Now wheres my
daughter

MR NICK
How should I know Youre her
father

(with needle)
Her loving father

DR PARNASSUS looks askance at MR NICK

MR NICK (CONTD)
Shes free isnt she

MR NICK smiles and blows smoke in PARNASSUSS face The smoke

fills the screen and becomes

EXT DESERT DAY 71
a dust storm The wind is howling The swirling dust

thins to reveal DRPARNASSUS alone exhausted trudging

across a vast desert

Hes tormented by his thoughts

DR PARNASSUS
What else could I do Valentina

What else could I have done What

other choice could I have made

Damn It was the right choice

Of course it was Of course

But where are you

(MORE)

71

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
Wheres my beautiful daughter
Wheres my darling How long must I
suffer

There is no proper road only endless sand but nevertheless
DR PARNASSUS reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct
paths

One leads to a tidy little suburban home the other up an
dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut
into the rock (the same one that MARTIN THE DRUNK chose not
to climb days earlier

DR PARNASSUS (CONTD)
No no no No more choices
please No more choices

Enraged he tries to push the sign over but is too feeble
Exhausted he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone

VOICE (VO)
(angry)
Hey
DR PARNASSUS alarmed rolls quickly off the stone

Now on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of
PERCYS head and face What hed thought was a stone was in
fact his old companion buried in the sand

DR PARNASSUS
Percy

DR PARNASSUS overjoyed begins to dig PERCY out

PERCY

About bloody time

DR PARNASSUS
Where have you been

PERCY
(irritated)
Here

DR PARNASSUS
How long have you been here

PERCY
How longs a piece of string Dont
ask daft questions 71

DR PARNASSUS
Thank God I found you I need your
advice
(indicating sign)
Ive got a problematical choice to
make

PERCY
Problematical my arse Come on I
know its against the grain

PERCY grabs DR PARNASSUSS cloak and begins to pull him
across the sand in the direction of the bungalow We can now
see the sign reads “Easy

DR PARNASSUS
(on his dignity)
No Suburban bungalows and all that
they evoke are anathema to me
Dammit Percy Stop Ive got my
pride

PERCY
Yeah it goes just before the fall

PERCY grabs DR PARNASSUSS cloak and begins to pull him
across the sand in the direction indicated by the sign which

we can now see reads Easy

PERCY (CONTD)

Come on I know its against the
grain
EXT SUBURBAN BUNGALOW 72

PERCY pulls the reluctant DR PARNASSUS up the drive of a
suburban bungalow past a perfect lawn and double garage to
the front door

PERCY rings the bell

DR PARNASSUS tries to make a run for it but PERCY holds him
fast

The door is opened by VALENTINA Shes older and is carrying
a BABY in her arms

Both DR PARNASSUS and VALENTINA are astonished Neither
knows what to say

72

DR PARNASSUS

Valentina
VALENTINA
Father
(recovering)
Where have you been All these
years I thought you were dead

DR PARNASSUS
So did I But you I

VALENTINA
Come in

VALENTINA steps back and ushers her father in

PERCY
(aside)
So far so good

PERCY is about to follow but VALENTINA focussing on her
father closes the door in his face

73 INT SUBURBAN BUNGALOW 73

VALENTINA shows DR PARNASSUS into the sitting-room He sits
on the sofa

KIDS VOICE (VO)
Mummy Can I have some ice-cream

A SMALL BOY enters from the kitchen

KID
Mummy

VALENTINA
Billy this is your grandad Say
hello to your grandad
(to Parnassus)
I think he looks a little like you

BILLY takes one look at DR PARNASSUS and runs back into the
kitchen

VALENTINA laughs
VALENTINA (CONTD)
Hes only five And hes very shy
Would you like some tea

73 73

DR PARNASSUS nods

VALENTINA (CONTD)
Okay you look after Imogen

She gives him the baby

VALENTINA (CONTD)
Shes eight months and so far
fortunately doesnt look in the
least like you

DR PARNASSUS is moved

VALENTINA (CONTD)

This is all I ever wanted I know
its not what you wanted for me
butwell there you go Im
happy
ANTON enters
ANTON

Hello Doctor
He puts his arm around VALENTINA

VALENTINA
Were both happy

DR PARNASSUS doesnt know what to say He sits there a
ragged old man with a baby on his knee tears streaming down
his face

EXT RAILWAY STATION CENTRAL LONDON

Little cut-out cardboard figures are performing in a toy
theatre

VOICE OF TOY CHARACTER (V0O)
Its your choice You can stay here
and look after mum and dad or come
with me and help fight the giant

SECOND TOY CHARACTER (VO)
Ill have to think about it

THE CAMERA pulls back to show PERCY manipulating the puppets
and giving them voices He and DR PARNASSUS are running a
stall selling toy theatres Business is good

The audience is made up of mainly KIDS with some ADULTS
COMMUTERS come and go

A COUPLE OF PARENTS purchase a theatre for their son DR
PARNASSUS takes the money and expertly wraps the theatre

DR PARNASSUS
Beautifully made Itll last for
years if properly looked after

NINE YEAR OLD SON
Does it come with a happy ending

DR PARNASSUS
Im afraid we cant guarantee that

THE CAMERA angles across the table

In a shadowy corner stands MR NICK smoking a cigarette

THE END
