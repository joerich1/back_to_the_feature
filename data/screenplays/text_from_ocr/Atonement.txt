INDIANAPOLIS INDIANA

INT BEDROOM OF MATTHEW CROSS - NIGHT

MATTHEW CROSS a handsome man in his early 20s is relaxing
on a sofa lounger in his bedroom talking on the phone to
his best friend DANIEL IRONS Matthew is the average young
adult caught in the transition between a teenager and an
adult

MATTHEW
I dont see why Im catching so
much hell for this I told Natalee
me and you were chillin tonight
like 3 days ago

DANIEL (VO)
Its like she expects you to spend
all your free time with her and
your friends get whats left
over as long as she
approvesand youre not having a
good time

MATTHEW
I know its bullshit She cant
understand that you were my best
friend like five years before I
even met her Shes so frustrating
sometimes Ugh I swear women
will be the destruction of mankind

DANIEL (VO)

Ha Ha I hear yah Thats why I
just keep six girls on the side
then just rotate them for each day
of the week

MATTHEW
What about the seventh day

DANIEL (VO)
Even a pimp needs a day of rest
MATTHEW
Yea ok lets get serious Well
let me call her and see what the
deal is Ill call you in a hot
minute I gotta eat first though

DANIEL (VO)
Aight late

MATTHEW
Late

Matthew Flips through a few channels before turning off the
TV and getting up He exits his room and heads downstairs

INT THE CROSSS HOME - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

Matthew descends the stairs looking towards the dining room
Already seated and the table are his mother DEBORAH father
THOMAS and 16 year old sister DIANE

DEBORAH
(jokingly)
So nice of you to grace us with
your presence Matthew Fix a plate
and come sit down Were going to
have dinner as a family

Matthew rolls his eyes but grins slightly He walks into
the kitchen and begins fixing a plate with his back to his
family

MATTHEW
I dont have a lot of time mom me
and Daniel are supposed to meet up
and talk about the apartment

DIANE (0S)
(Giggling)
Bout time

MATTHEW stares down at his food trying to think of a
comeback He lifts his head slowing as he notices an
absolute silence

MATTHEW turns as the camera stays focused on him His mouth
drops in shock His plate falls shattering on the floor
The camera swings behind him to show what he sees

DEBORAH THOMAS and DIANE are all floating several feet off
the ground in the same spots they were eating moments
earlier Their heads are tilted back with an almost
dumbfounded look frozen on their faces Their arms and legs
hang limp at their side
MATTHEW is frozen in place with is mouth open and a
terrified look on his face His families skin has an eerie
white glow to it that begins to intensify Soon only white
silhouettes can be seen Suddenly their bodies disappear
out of their clothing which fall to the ground landing on
the table chairs and the floor

MATTHEW looking absolutely horrified staggers back taking
in short gasps of air He slips on the fallen food and
slams his head into the refrigerator door cracking the
panelling He falls to the floor landing on his butt his
back rests against the refrigerator

MATTHEW wears a blank expression on his face as if the blow
knocked his emotions right out of him He slides sideways
and falls to his side

CLOSEUP ON MATTHEWS FACE

A tear rolls out of MATTS eye and down his face As MATT
loses consciousness we are left with Matts point of view
looking underneath the table where his families clothing
lies

The screen goes black the main credits roll to

INT MATTHEW CROSSS BEDROOM - DAY

MATTHEW stands at his dresser cleaning a six shot revolver
There is a mirror on the wall above the dresser MATTHEW
watches himself while he cleans

MATTHEW (VO)
Within a few days of the
disappearances it seemed as if the
entire world had gone crazy
Planes crashed boats ran ashore
car pileups on every major highway
Id say the insurance companies
have their work cut out for them
It was estimated anywhere from 15
to 35 million people had vanished
worldwide over night Vanished
without a trace The majority of
those taken were children There
were riots in the streets Looting
got so bad that eventually the
police only responded if someone
got seriously injured or killed A
few men tried to break into my
dads car last night I fired off
a few shots at them from the porch
I think I might have gotten one of
them No cops came this time Im
sure theyre busy I wonder how
long a million missing person
reports takes to sort through I
wonder when theyll get to my
family

As MATTHEW finishes talking he also finishes cleaning the
gun He loads the revolver cocks the gun and put the
barrel under his chin He looks into the mirror and
squeezes the trigger The hammer clicks but nothing
happens He cocks the gun again and pulls the trigger The
gun does not fire MATTHEW yells in frustration and takes a
step back He aims the gun at the mirror and pulls the
trigger The gun goes off shattering the glass

MATTHEW walks slowly over to his lounger and sits down

TIGHT SHOT OF MATTHEW

MATTHEW looks at the gun then the shattered mirror and back
at the gun again He cocks the gun again and puts it to his
temple He closes his eyes and breathes out of his nose
three times as he counts to himself On the third breathe
he opens his eyes and puts the gun in his pocket He walks
down the stairs and out the front door

EXT MATTHEWS HOUSE - DAY

Matthew sits down on his front steps and looks up into the
clear blue sky then down to the overgrown lawn Matt looks
straight ahead of him Across the street is a large
apartment complex It looks slightly run down Matt
faintly hears a muffled scream coming from one of the
apartments

YOUNG WOMAN (0S)
(muffled)
Somebody help me

Matt stares at the three story apartment complex towards the
second floor He stands up and listens but theres only
silence He turns back towards his house and starts to walk
back inside The camera looks over his shoulder while hes
facing his house A door quickly opens on one of the second
floor apartments A young woman gets halfway out the door
when two sets of hands reach out and grab her They pull
her back in Matt pauses as he reaches for his doornob He
turns around and looks back at the apartments but cannot
see anyone Right before he turns again a hand grabs the
doorway and the woman manages to get her head outside the
door She looks directly at Matt

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Please God help me

The womans head disappears back inside and the door slams
shut Looking like his adrenaline has just kick in eyes
wide Matt takes out the revolverand bolts across the
street and up the first flight of stairs to the apartments
second level He stops outside the closed door and pauses
for a moment

MATTHEW
What am I doin

He hears another muffled scream and movement from inside the
apartment He kicks the door in and thrusts the revolver
forward Ahead of him he sees a vile looking middle aged
man with his shirt off standing over a beautiful young
woman CALLISTA DAVENPORT on a beat-up couch CALLISTA
looks half Middle Eastern half American She has long dark
hair and gorgeous eyes The vile man has one hand tightly
gripping her shirt and the other hand raised to strike her
The MAN quickly turns his head to look at the doorway MATT
cocks the gun

MATTHEW (CONTD)
Dont

INT APARTMENT â€”- DAY

As MATT steps into the room the MANS eyes dart to the other
side of the door MATT just kicked in Before MATT can turn
to see what the MAN was looking at a second man younger
but still like a dirty thug rushes MATT and punches him in
the face MATT falls to the ground dropping the gun

The SECOND MAN gets on top of MATT and begins raining down
punches on him MATT is doing a semi-decent job at
blocking The first man standing over CALLISTA watches the
fight and smiles CALLISTA uses this opportunity to grab a
nearby glass ashtray and smashes it with tremendous force
into the mans face He falls to the ground clutching his
bloody face CALLISTA gets up kicks the man in the groin
and stomps on his head The man stops moving CALLISTA
rushes to where MATT and the SECOND MAN are fighting She
picks up the revolver The SECOND MAN is still on top of
MATT unaware of what has just happened to his friend

MATTS POINT OF VIEW - ATTACKER

The SECOND MAN has MATT by the throat with one hand and has
the other raised to strike Suddenly a portion of the
SECOND MANS right shoulder erupts and little bits of skin
and blood spray forward hitting Matt in the face as a bullet
tears through and goes into the floor right next to Matts
head

CALLISTAS POINT OF VIEW - ATTACKER
CALLISTA removes the barrel of the gun from the entry point
on the SECOND MANS right shoulder He falls on top of
Matthew Callista stands shaking looking down at the man
Suddenly he raises and turns grabbing towards Callistas
waist She pistol whips him upside his head He falls off
MATT onto the floor unconscious Matt stares wide eyed at
Callista from the floor CALLISTA bends down and offers a
trembling hand to MATT Matt stands up and takes a look
around the room

MATTHEW
Come on we gotta get out of here
CALLISTA
(in a daze)
What
MATTHEW
Lets go

Matt leads the way outside and across the street and into
his house When they get inside CALLISTA turns to Matt
looking puzzled

INT MATTHEW CROSSS LIVING ROOM

CALLISTA
You just happened to be across the
street with a loaded gun waiting to
save me

MATTHEW
Ugh Not exactly I was
justcleaning my gunthen I
walked outside and I heard you
screaming

CALLISTA
Lucky for me huh

MATTHEW
Yeah I suppose

Matt looks down at the floor embarrassed He walks into the
living room and put the gun in his coffee table drawer then
walks into the bathroom to clean himself off Callista
looks at pictures on the wall Matt Walks back in

MATTHEW (CONTD)
So anyway my names Matt

CALLISTA
Callista Thanks for what you did
back there Matt I mean it If you
hadnt come over there I really
might be dead right now

MATTHEW
Maybe it wasnt your time

CALLISTA
(smiling)
Maybe not I think we should call
the cops and let them know were
over here Let them know what
happened

MATTHEW
It doesnt matter they wont show
upthey never do anymore Hey I
gotta make a call real quick then
we can get out of here ok

MATTHEW picks up the phone and dials in a number While the
phone rings he looks over at CALLISTA

MATTHEW (CONTD)
Make yourself at home

FADE TO

INT HOME OF DANIEL IRONS

DANIEL sits in a dimly lit den at a cluttered desk immersed
in research of some type DANIEL is in his early 20s He
has dark hair and is clean shaven He has a a small scar
etched into the corner of his eyebrow He has a tattoo of a
cross on his left forearm Hes well dressed and has his
hair gelled even though he has nowhere important to be
DANIEL just likes to look nice On top of the desk is an
expensive computer an old bible a small TV turned to a
news station and stacks of newspapers DANIELS leans back
in his chair and looks over his shoulder and hollers to his
mother NANCY

DANIEL
MOM Call Matt again Hes gotta
be there

NANCY

Daniel Im worried about Matthew
Maybe you should just go over
there He doesnt need to be alone
so soon after losing

NANCY bursts into tears and walks out of the room to fetch
the phone DANIEL listens to the TV as he clicks at a link
on the computer

TV REPORTER (0S)

to make an official statement at
this time
DANIEL
(impersonating a SS
agent)
We seem to have lost the President
along with a couple million of our
citizens Dont worry theyll turn
up Fucking morons

DANIEL turns to watch the TV

ON TV SCREEN

TV REPORTER
Current poles are still leaning
strongly to terrorist involvement
yet religious groups still maintain
we are seeing biblical prophecy
playing out as we speak In the
studio today we have terrorist
expert and author of Terror Today
Tyrants Tomorrow Dr Gregory
Manning Dr Manning your
thoughts on the disappearances

MANNING
Thanks Erin I along with many of
my respected colleagues believe
that what were dealing with is the
actions of a Unified World
Terrorist Organization We need to
forget everything we thought we
knew about our countries supposed
war on terror The terrorists have
brought the war to us in a way we
didnt even know was possible

NANCY walks back in the room eyes still red but looking
hopeful

NANCY
(whispering)
Its Matthew

DANIEL mutes the TV and grabs the phone

DANIEL
Where the hell have you been You

weve been

MATTHEW (VO)

happened to me today

DANIEL

INT MATTHEWS FATHERS CAR - NIGHT

Matt and Cal are pulling out of Matts driveway
towards Daniels house

MATTHEW

CALLISTA

Callista grows silent and stares out the window
MATTHEW (CONTD)

Callista sighs She turns to face Matt

You didnt lose anyone

CALLISTA
All my family lives in Israel I

Callista grows silent again Wanting to avoid an awkward
silence Matt keeps the conversation going

MATTHEW
So what was the deal with those
guys today

CALLISTA
It was the first time I had dealt
with them They were really messed
up when I got there I guess they
werent used to being in a room
alone with a girl that had all her
teeth

MATTHEW
Ha ha yeah And you werent
related to them so that had to be
pretty confusing too

CALLISTA
Hahaha exactly

DISSOLVE TO

INT HOME OF DANIEL IRONS - NIGHT

Daniel sits on a couch by the door waiting for Matt In
addition to Daniel and his mother there are several people
all in their early to mid twenties both male and female
walking around eating watching tv etc

The doorbell rings Daniel bolts up and answers the door
DANIEL
Hey man you alright

Daniel pauses when he sees Callista

DANIEL
Uhh is this your guest

MATTHEW

Daniel leads them into the living room Matt looks around
the house at the different people

MATTHEW
Daniel who are all these people

DANIEL
Moms been letting people that lost
their parents come stay with us

Daniel turns to Callista and smiles

DANIEL (CONTD)
There should be some sleeping space
left in the bathtub

CALLISTA
I cant wait

DANIEL
The shower alarms a little
annoying though It doesnt matter
if you hit snooze cause youre
already wet

Callista giggles
Nancy enters the living room Her hair is tied back but
partially fallen down Shes mixing something in a bowl

while she talks on a phone held between her cheek and
shoulder

NANCY

MATTHEW
(blushing velvet)
Thanks Nancy By the way Im no

NANCY

MATTHEW
Nothing Nancy thank you

Nancy hurries back into the kitchen

CALLISTA
Why does she call you Matty

MATTHEW
When we were little she used to
call me Matty and Daniel Danny
Guess old habits die hard

Daniel fights hard to hold back laughter

DANIEL
Dont let him fool you He
specifically requests that she
calls him that

Callista giggle

CALLISTA
Is that right

DANIEL
It sure is

Daniel leads them into his living room

DANIEL (CONTD)
Ok Matty lets hear about your
day

MATTHEW
(under breath)
Douchebag

Matt and Cal sit on a couch against the wall while Dan sits
in a sofa couch across from them As they recount their
story several of the new guests come and sit down wherever
they can find space and listen There are two brothers NICK
and ADAM SYKES A young woman SARAH MILLER and another
young man RYAN TURNER As Matt finishes his story he turns
to Daniel
MATTHEW (CONTD)
--So here we are ready to hear
what you think is going on

Daniel slowly nods his head while biting his lip The
newfound company has made him slightly reluctant to speak
but he continues anyway

DANIEL

(addressing everyone)
Ive been doing a lot of research
and digging and from what Ive
gathered the disappearances are not
terrorist attacks or alien
abduction The missing people were
taken in the rapture God did this
and we are all the people left
behind

Immediately everyone begins talking at once some disagreeing
some supporting

RYAN
Yeah bullshit

SARAH
Its not bullshit look it up in the
Bible

RYAN
Yeah just go to biblebullshitcom
Its all there

SARAH
Youre an ass

DANIEL
Whoa geez Everybody slow it down
Listen the UN leaders are calling
for global peace and cooperation

MATTHEW
So what

DANIEL
Think about it Global
unityglobal currencyglobal
religionopen your eyes this is
the Tribulation Its all in the
Bible

CALLISTA
They havent asked for a global
currency or religion

DANIEL
No but they will
MATTHEW
I think its terrorists I was
listening to the news earlier
today Theyre talking about a
world terrorist organization that
could have been in existence for
centuries

DANIEL
Man fuck that

MATTHEW
Daniel if this is the tribulation
then why is your mom still here
Why are there a lot of people here
that shouldnt be

DANIEL
I dont know Maybe she should be
Maybe all those left behind should
have been The only relationship
with God I can criticize is my own

CALLISTA
What if some people were left
behind to help to show people the
way I mean there were a lot of
religious figures left behind

RYAN
They definitely deserved to stay
SARAH
(rudely)
So what do you think happened then
Ryan
RYAN
I dont know I guess either
terrorists or alienssomething

I dont know
Sarah rolls her eyes

SARAH
You just want it to be aliens so
you can get an anal probe

Several people chuckle

RYAN
Youll have to help me ease it in
though I know thats your
specialty and all Do you have any
lube left or have you used it all

DANIEL
Ok children lets try to get along
I think we can at least agree on
something Ryan youre kind of an
asshole

RYAN
(grinning)
Fair enough

DANIEL
Also we could all use some rest
Everybody just help yourself to a
sleeping bag in the hallway closet
If you cant find one Im sure my
mom would be happy to sow one for
you

Everyone makes preparations to sleep laying out bags on the
floor brushing teeth etc Matt picks a spot on a couch by
a window The moon is barely visible behind thick clouds
Cal climbs into a sleeping back on the floor beside the
couch

MATTHEW
Cal you sure you dont want the
couch

CALLISTA

No Im fine When the sun starts
shining through early in the
morning youll wish you were down
here with me

MATTHEW
Hmmm
CALLISTA
What
MATTHEW
I was just imaging Haha
CALLISTA
You know what I meant Goodnite

Matty

Matt pauses for a second He tries to respond with a
sarcastic tone but it ends up coming out sweetly

MATTHEW
Goodnight Cally

Matt stares at the sealing Neither sees the other
blushing

CALLISTA
Goodnight
Matts eyes soon grow heavy and close

CUT TO
SUPERIMPOSED MANY MILES AWAY

INT DOWNSTAIRS OF AN EXPENSIVE TWO STORY HOME - NIGHT

An older man in his 60s lays in a recliner in his den
watching the weather channel The man has grey hair but is
still in great shape The man watches the screen but
doesnt pay much attention

WEATHERMAN (0S)
series Of earthquakes have many
Carolinians scared and confused
The recent quakes have been part of
what appears to be a statewide
trend that has seismologists
scratching their heads So far the
damage has been minimal but

The old man rises from his chair Hanging from the wall are
many old looking photos of people shaking hands as well as
dusty looking awards Tucked away in the corner of the den
is a large desk littered with dusty looking books and
blueprints Above the desk is an old NASA poster The man
rubs his belly and grunts He looks towards his kitchen and
begins the shuffle towards it

KITCHEN

In the kitchen is a kind looking older woman who is the
mans wife Shes misting several hanging plants with a
spray bottle while humming softly

OLD MAN
Think Ill have a sandwich

The woman smiles and continues to hum and tend to the
plants The old man makes his way to the fridge The
camera angle is a side view of the man walking up to the
refrigerator The fridge door swings open towards the
screen The man has a sudden surprised look on his face
The look quickly changes to happiness as the man reaches in
the fridge and pulls out some delicious looking turkey meat

OLD MAN (CONTD)
I see you got the good stuff this
time

OLD WOMAN
You made such a fuss last time how
could I forget
The man continues to smile as he pulls out a head of
lettuce fresh tomato and condiments He reaches on the top
of the fridge and pulls down some wheat bread He lays out
all the items in a neat row on the counter He reaches
toward a knife rack and pulls out a long very sharp looking
knife He begins to slice the tomato and shred the lettuce
working quickly and almost without attention There are
several instances where it seems he will cut himself but he
does not He finishes putting the sandwich together and
closes his eyes as he puts the sandwich to his lips

OLD WOMAN (0S) (CONTD)

The mans eyes bolt open and he turns to see what the cause
of the scream is He looks to his wife who points towards
the entreway leading into the living room

OLD WOMAN (CONTD)
Snake

The man looks at the floor just in time to see a large
snakes tail moving out of view into the next room The
camera stays in a 3rd person view behind the old man The
man picks up the knife in his right hand and darts into the
living room searching wildly for the large snake He looks
towards the staircase against the wall He catches a brief
glimpse of the tail moving into the upstairs floor

OLD MAN
Jesus hes fast

OLD WOMAN (0S)
Im calling animal control

OLD MAN
Dont worry I got em

The old man runs up the stairs taking them two at a time
As he reaches the top he looks left then right seeing the
tail disappear into his bedroom The door is slightly open
and the lights are off

OLD MAN (CONTD)
Son of a bitch

The man charges forward knocking the door open with his
right shoulder and flicking the light on with his left hand
As the man flicks the light on the bulb blows lighting the
room up momentarily with bright light In that brief flash
the man sees the snakes tail disappear into his darkened
closet on the opposite side of the room The man doesnt
slow down for a minute as he charges towards the closet

As soon as the man enters the room the camera stays fixed
right outside in the hallway looking in
When the man reaches the closet he flicks the light on which
blows out immediately as well In the brief moment of light
we see the man scream and stumble backwards With the light
from the outside hall we see the man get suddenly jerked
forward into the dark closet His legs hang out into the
dimly lit room They thrash for a moment until we hear a
soft crunch and snap come from inside the closet The mans
legs go limp

The camera cuts to the bottom of the stares looking at the
old mans wife She stands at the bottom of the stairs
looking horrified and frightened Shes holding the phone
at her side

OPERATOR (VO)
Maammaam can you describe the
snake for me

The camera remains on the woman as she looks up the stairs
She lets out a terrifying scream and drops the phone She
turns and runs for the front door

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

The downstairs lights are on but the curtains are drawn

The womans silhouette can be seen running toward the front
door Her screams can be heard from out front The handle
turns and the door opens slightly outward when it suddenly
slams shut and the womans silhouette is ripped out of view
The camera begins to pan back from the house as the womans
screams are abruptly stopped

CUT TO

DANIELS HOUSE - MORNING
Matt wakes up to intense sunlight shining into his face

MATTHEW
Ughhdamn you Callista

Matt buries his face into his pillow He can hear voices
and laughter coming from the kitchen Matt takes the pillow
off his face and looks around the living room There are a
few people still asleep on the floor Matt groggily gets up
and slowly makes his way towards the kitchen Nick and Ryan
are both asleep on the floor between Matt and the kitchen
Matt does a quick hop over Nick but lands on the corner of
his sleeping bag and slips then stumbles stepping on Ryans
face

MATTHEW (CONTD)
Oopssorry man
Ryan grunts and makes a few whiny noises in a very sleepy
tone then rolls over and falls back asleep

As Matt enters the kitchen he sees Nancy cooking along with
a young boy just old enough to see over the counter helping
His name is Timothy Hes around 12 years old Hes skinny
and has messy dark hair and freckles on his face and arms
Cal Sarah and Daniel are sitting at the kitchen table
talking and laughing The girls laugh loudly as Daniel
finishes telling a funny story As Matt enters the kitchen
he gets a look from the girls making it seem he was somehow
involved

DANIEL
Howd you sleep there big guy

MATTHEW
Pretty good there little guy I
had a fantastic sunshine wake-up
call

Matt looks at Cal and smiles She gives him the I told you
so look He gives her the yeah yeah look

Daniel gets up and walks over to Matt

DANIEL
(talking quietly)
I never got to finish talking about
my disappearance theories last
night After we eat meet me on
the back porch I want to show you
the research Ive been collecting

MATTHEW
Ok

Matt sits down on a bench that has been pulled up to the
table to make room for the new company Daniel runs and
hops on the bench sliding down into Matt and almost knocking
Matt over Nancy swings around

NANCY
(in a stern tone)
Boys

Nancys tone sounds like one she used on a regular basis
when Matt and Daniel were younger

NANCY (CONTD)
Sorry Matthew you two arent boys
anymore

DANIEL
Just at heart mom

MATTHEW
Its ok Nancy I miss the old
times I miss that cooking too
whats going on with those eggs
over there

NANCY
(smiling)
You mean these scrambled cheese
eggs with toast covered in butter
and jelly Ohh I dont think youd
enjoy these at all

TIMOTHY
I helped

Daniel stares down at his food making a grossed out face
DANIEL

Whoa geez What part did you help

make

Timothy glares at Daniel

TIMOTHY
I added some floor spice to your
eggs
DANIEL
(laughing)
Floor spice huh I like your
style

Everyone in the kitchen laughs They finish up their
breakfast and the girls begin to help with dishes as Matt
and Daniel make their way to the back porch Behind Daniels
house is a beautiful wooded area Matt sits down on the
steps and takes in some deep breaths through his nose
Daniel sits beside Matt and pulls some folded pieces of
paper out of his pocket The pieces of paper are covered in
notes and Bible verses Daniel gets right to business

DANIEL
Alright first of all in second
Timothy chapter 3 verse 1-7 it
says But realize this that in the
last days difficult times will
come For men will be lovers of
self lovers of money disobedient
to their parents ungrateful
unholy unforgiving conceited
lovers of pleasure rather than
lovers of God always learning and
never able to come to the knowledge
of the truth

MATTHEW
That first part sounds like every
teenager in the world

DANIEL

(ignoring Matthews

sarcasm)
Well listen to this In Matthew
chapter 24 verse 3 Jesuss
disciples ask him what the signs of
his coming and the end of times
will be So in verse five through
eight Jesus says there will be wars
and rumors of wars nations and
kingdoms will rise against each
other and there will be famines
pestilences and earthquakes in
various places So I mean all that
war shit has been happening
especially in Iraq and the
terrorist attacks in the US and
overseas And Im sure youve seen
everything about the earthquakes on
the news But it says these are
just the beginning of sorrows

MATTHEW
What about the disappearances

DANIEL
Oh shit yeah hold on

Daniel flips back to the beginning of his notes

DANIEL (CONTD)
Ok in first Thessalonians
chapters 16 through 17 it says For
the Lord himself shall descend from
heaven with a shout with the voice
of the archangel and with the
trump of God and the dead in
Christ shall rise first Then we
which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the
air and so shall we ever be with
the Lord

MATTHEW
I dont know man this is all so
crazy I feel like I just need to
see something more before I can buy
into thislike Angels on TV or
something

DANIEL

Well Ill tell you what theres a
lot of crazy shit that goes down
during the tribulation so lets
just wait and see what happens The
first sign of end of the world and
Ill explain everything cool

MATTHEW
I can handle that

Callista and Sarah can be heard from inside Matt looks
over his shoulder towards the girls He gets a sad
thoughtful look on his face

DANIEL
You miss her dont you
MATTHEW
Who My mom
DANIEL
No Natalee She wouldve been

gone before you could have called
Its not your fault

MATTHEW
I just wish I could have told her I
loved her one last time I wish I
could have told all of them

Daniel hugs Matt around the shoulder

DANIEL
Come on dont stress so much about
it Im sure the answers will come

soon

Matt smiles weakly as the two get up and go back inside The
screen fades to

3 NIGHTS LATER

Matt lays down on the couch to go to bed Everyone is
already asleep in their usual spots on the floor Matt
closes his eyes and rolls over to face into the couch He
soon drifts off to sleep

FADE TO

MATTS DREAM SEQUENCE - INT DANIELS HOUSE - NIGHT

Matt wakes suddenly and looks around the room To his
horror everyone is gone All that remains is their clothes
in the exact spot where they went to sleep Matt jumps up
from the couch and begins to look around frantically He
runs his hands harshly through his hair

MATTHEW
Noplease

Matts attention is drawn towards the front door The walls
seem to vibrate slowly and rhythmically while the door stays
still The front door is outlined in an intense white
light Matt slowly creeps towards the door his breathing
is shallow and his body shakes slightly He places a hand
on the door and inches towards the peephole He closes his
left eye tightly and puts his right eye to the hole

Its daytime outside Theres nothing to be seen out of the
hole but a calm looking orchard and a single magnificent
looking tree in the center Matt breathes a sigh of relief
He turns around and suddenly is face to face with a deadly
viper snake its fangs bared Matt yells and stumbles back
into the door

MATTS POV - THE SNAKE

Callista is scantily dressed with the viper wrapped up
around her waist and right arm The snake almost looks like
and extension of her arm Both Callistas finger and the
snakes head point at the door towards the outside

CALLISTA
(in an eerie snakelike
voice)
Look again

Matt turns quickly and looks out the peephole again His
mom dad and sister are floating in a circle around the
tree bodies limp skin glowing a dim white Matt jerks the
door open and rushes outside

EXT ORCHARD - DAY

Daniels house stands out in the middle of an apple orchard
The orchard is deserted except for Matt and the single giant
apple tree Callista descends the front porch steps
gracefully When she gets to the last step she bends down
and puts her arm to the ground The snakes slithers off and
moves towards Matt and the tree

The branches of the tree are too far up for Matt to reach
except for a single branch A large apple weighs the branch
down to where its only 5 or 6 feet off the ground Matt
looks over his shoulder at Callista She nods towards the
apple The snake begins to slide up the trunk into a now
visible large hole in the tree The hole is eye level with
Matt He has a very curious look on his face as the snake
disappears inside the tree trunk He pulls the apple down
and the branch shoots into the air like an enormous weight
has just been freed from it

Matt holds the apple to his mouth but does not bite into it
yet He begins to walk towards the hole in the tree He
stops several inches in front of the opening Its pitch
black inside The moment he sinks his teeth into the apple
a gruesome face shoots out of the hole almost touching noses
with Matt Matt cries out and jumps back The face looks
like a human skull covered in snake skin with a enlarged
frontal lobe and massive black eyes We only see the face
for a moment as Matt quickly spins away towards the house

As he turns a large mans hand grips his shoulder and the
blade of a sword is plunged into his chest Matt cries out
in shock and pain He looks up to see the face of a
breathtaking angel The angel looks handsome and fierce
The angel is dressed in shimmering armor and has
outstretched dazzling white wings The angel puts his cheek
against Matts

DREAM ANGEL
Be watchful and strengthen the
things which remain that are ready
to die for I have not found thy
works perfect before God

Matthew stares ahead mouth open unable the move The
angel grips Matts shoulder tightly and extracts the blade
as swiftly as he bore it moments before

TIGHT SHOT OF MATTS FACE

Matts eyes burst open and his mouth drops The camera
zooms on his eyes A full moon is reflected in his pupils
As his retinas contract they form rings around the image of
the moon inside his eyes

CUT TO SHOT OF NIGHT SKY

A vibrant full moon can be seen with a massive cloud ring
around it

As the camera pans back Matt is now sitting upright on the
couch but still holds the same face from the dream Sweat
is pouring down the sides of his face His shirt is soaked
He pants heavily trying to catch his breath He looks
around to find everyone still sleeping soundly He
collapses back onto the couch

MATTHEW
(still panting)
Holy shit

The screen begins to fade

MATTHEW (VO) (CONTD)
Oh my God

The screen begins to fade out just becoming black when it
suddenly cuts back to an overhead shot of Matt asleep on the
couch Its morning and hes being shaken awake by Daniel
DANIEL
(excited and a little
scared)
Come on Outside Its happening

Daniel practically drags Matt off the couch and takes him
outside

OUTSIDE DANIELS HOUSE - DAY
The streets are filled with people looking up

CUT TO

SHOT OF THE SKY

A brilliant meteor shower can be seen even though its
daytime Tiny little fire trails shine all over the sky
The color of the sky seems slightly off The camera pans
over to the sun revealing the beginning of a solar eclipse

Sarah Nick and Adam are in the middle of the yard Sarah
looks over her shoulder at Matt and Daniel

SARAH
Isnt this amazing

Ryan Callista Nancy Timothy and the rest of the house
guests walk around from the back of the house Sarah looks
at Ryan

SARAH (CONTD)
Terrorists my ass

Ryan smirks and gives her the up yours look Nancy pops
him upside the head

Matt stares up into the sky

MATTHEW
This is amazing How long has this
been going on

DANIEL
It started about 45 minutes ago

MATTHEW
And youre just now waking me up
Thanks buddy

DANIEL
Sorry there guy Mom saw it first
then everyone just kind of jumped
up and came outside Better late
than never right
Matt continues to watch the sky

MATTHEW
(absentmindedly)
Yeah I guess

Daniel turns to face Matthew He puts one hand on his
shoulder and leans in close An image flashes of the angel
from Matts dream putting his hand on his shoulder and
leaning in close to speak Matt shudders and steps back

DANIEL
What Dont get any ideas there
stud I just want to tell you
somethingshit

MATTHEW
Sorry go ahead

DANIEL
I think some crazy stuff is about
to start happening Right before I
woke you up this morning I checked
the news The meteor showing is
happening everywhere all over the
worldat the same time Half way
through the report the satellite
feed cut out so I turned to
another station They lost their
satellite feed too Then the TV
satellite cut out altogether That
got me thinking so I checked my
satellite radio and got nick to try
to get online with his wireless
laptop

MATTHEW
And

DANIEL
None of that shit works But the
house phone still works I think
things running through cable lines
are all working for now Just the
satellites are a big negative

MATTHEW
You did all that before waking me
up Dickhead

DANIEL
Its your fuckin fault for not
waking up That doesnt matter
anyway Youre seeing it now
arent you Before the
disappearances there was news about
the signing of a treaty between
Israel and the Egyptians and

Syrians It says in the bible that
after the rapture Israel will sign
a treaty with her enemies If that
treaty was signed pretty soon the
Antichrist is going to come to
power

MATTHEW
And then

DANIEL
Were all fuckedoh yeah and one
more thing

A massive earthquake starts Glass everywhere shatters
Everyone falls to the ground People are screaming and
shouting Loud thunder begin to sound Matt looks up to
see thick clouds everywhere in the sky The thunder gets so
loud many people have to hold their ears The earthquake
abruptly stops

CALLISTA
(shouting)
I hear the thunder but wheres the

ligh

A single massive lightning bolt strikes a tall oak tree
about 30 yards away from Daniels house The tree splits
into two halves which fall to the ground burnt and smoking
Theres a brief pause where nobody says anything they all
just stare at the tree Suddenly another bolt fires from
the sky striking the exact same spot Several people cry
out The second bolt is intensely bright and stays visible
for several seconds creating a semi-blinding effect The
camera cuts to Matts first person view A blurry figure is
standing right between the two halves of the tree where the
lightning just struck His vision slowly comes into focus
until things are finally clear The figure is the angel
from Matts dream Hes wearing engraved angelic armor and
has long golden hair Two large white wings spread out from
behind his back Nancy and Sarah both faint Daniel falls
to his knees

MATTHEW
This cant be happening

The angel begins to speak His voice can be heard clearly
by everyone regardless of their distance from him

MICHAEL
I am Michael You both know me
and you know whence I am and I am
not come of myself but he that
sent me is true whom you know not
But I know him for I am from him
and he has sent me
Both Matthew and Daniel have dumbfounded looks on their
faces

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Nothing is secret that will not be
revealed nor anything hidden that
will not be known and come to
light Therefore take heed how you
hear For whoever hears more will
be given and whoever does not
even what he seems to have will be
taken from him

Thunder booms as a third lightning bolt strikes right where
the angel stands Ina flash he is gone The crowd stares
silently jaws dropped

addition we have experienced mass
hallucinations and the disruption
of all our satellite technology

The first step is unification I
have agreed to give my full

Some immediate changes can be
expected One of the hardest
challenges weve faced in the past
is cutting the massive funds these
terrorist groups has been
receiving There is a man within
the UN who I cannot name at this
time who has found a solution to
this financial dilemma A single
world currency This currency will
be known as the United Nations
Mark It will be a completely
digital currency only accepted by
countries within the UN The
terrorists hard currency will
become useless and any digital
funds they currently possess will
devalue so much it will be
virtually worthless In addition
all media outlets will now operate
under the jurisdiction of the UN

INT HASHANS HOME - DAY

Hashan a middle eastern looking man in his mid-50s walks
hurriedly down the hallway of his home towards the front
door He is wearing a djellaba and has a prayer matt tucked
under his arm He hurries past some photos on the wall

The camera zooms in on the first photo The picture shows a
family portrait of a beautiful American woman a younger
looking Hashan a teenage boy and two cute little girls

The camera begins to pan to the right revealing the other
pictures one at a time The next photo shows Hashan
throwing a baseball with the teenage boy The next picture
shows the two little girls wearing excessive makeup and

singing into hair brushes The camera stops on the fourth
picture It shows Hashan sitting on the couch with a
younger looking Callista Hashan is Callistas father

CUT TO

EXT HASHANS HOME - DAY

Hashan exits the front door There are thousands of people
in the streets bowed down in prayer The camera stays
focused on Hashan not showing any of the skyline Hashan
walks forward several feet then unravels his prayer matt and
gets down on his knees He puts his face to the ground and
stretches out his arms in front of him A chant sounds
throughout the masses They all raise up in unison The
camera stays focused on Hashans hands as they raise into
the air The sky becomes visible in the background then
comes into focus Thousands of tiny meteorites blaze
through the sky All the hands go down simultaneously while
the camera stays focused on the sky

The camera begins to focus closer on the meteorites It
moves to one in particular The meteorite begins to break
up as it enters the atmosphere Its reduced to the size of
a softball when it stops breaking up The camera begins to
swing around the meteorite so that its facing the surface
below The camera locks on a 3rd person view behind the
meteorite as is plummets to the ground Below a massive
crowd can be seen formed around a circle of bare earth 40
feet wide

In the center of the circle are two raggedly dressed men
The men are named Elikai and Uriah They look dirty and
underfed As the meteorite speeds closer to the crowd

Elikai can be seen raising an arm

A third man can be seen just inside the circle holding a
large knife The meteorite gets closer and closer until
finally Elikai lowers his hand just as the meteorite slams
into the back of the man holding the knife killing him
instantly

The camera cuts to Elikai and Uriahs POV A fourth man
runs forward holding a handgun Uriah raises his hand as
the attacker pulls the trigger The hammer clicks but the
gun does not fire Uriah lowers his hand as a tennis ball-
sized meteorite slams into the attackers head He falls
dead next to the other attacker Several people in the
crowd fall to their knees and begin to pray

ELIKAT
(loud booming voice)
Let all who may hear listen to
these things that will come to
pass
Elikais voice can be heard for many miles As he continues
to speak many others fall to their knees as well

URIAH
(loud booming voice)
The great deceiver will come to
power and he will deceive many He
will bring with him the mark which
no man should dare take

ELIKAI
Repent

URIAH
Repent For soon you will witness
the abomination of desolation

ELIKAI

Then there shall be great
tribulation such as was not since
the beginning of the world to this
time no nor shall ever be again

There shall arise false Christs
and false prophets and they will
show great signs and wonders and
if possible they will deceive even

Nancy leads the group outside Daniel shuts the door behind
them Matthew walks into the living room and sits down ina
chair next to a window overlooking the front lawn Daniel
and Callista can be heard rummaging around in the kitchen
Matt watches the group make their way down the street He
suddenly gets a very serious and thoughtful look on his
face Matt stares out into the cloudy sky looking sad
Gradually a loud chopping of air sound can be heard It
continues to get louder In the distance Matt can see a
fleet of helicopters approaching Theres at least 25 of

them Matt makes no movements he just sits and stares out
into the sky

Daniel and Callista poke their heads in the doorway

DANIEL
Yo man come check this shit out

Matt pays Daniel no attention He just continues to stare
out the window deep in thought

and Daniel)

EXT MATTHEW HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Matthew stands outside his front steps looking up into his
second story window He looks from side to side for any
signs of a break-in Everything seems normal and quiet
Matt walks up to the front door and unlocks the dead bolt

It makes a soft thud as it slides into the door Matt steps

inside and looks around Shadows are cast all over the
inside of his house He makes his way up the steps
silently in the dark The camera cuts to the darkened

kitchen area Matts broken plate and food still lie on the

floor The camera cuts to the dining room The table is
still set with 3 plates now containing moldy food on them
The clothing of Matts family is still strewn about the
table and floor The camera then cuts back to Matt walking
into his room and flicking on the lights

MATTS POV - MIRROR

The mirror is still shattered Cracked fragments still hang

along the border The camera pans down to the floor The
glass remains of the mirror lie in a neatly stacked pile
Matt looks towards his closet The door is slightly ajar
Without hesitating Matt turns and walks out of his room
downstairs and into his living room He opens the coffee
table drawer where he stashed his revolver the day he met
Callista He takes out the gun and marches back up the
steps and into his room Not pausing he continues over to
his closet and jerks the door open quickly holding the

revolver close to his body pointing forward The closet is
empty

He reaches in and grabs a bookbag He walks over to his
dresser and begins to fill the bookbag with clothes He
finishes and grabs a family photo off his dresser He exits
his room then walks across the hall into his parents room
Matt opens his dads top dresser drawer and removes a box of
bullets He empties out the bullets already in the gun onto
the top of the dresser He loads in six new bullets and
puts the box into his bookbag He casually turns towards
the doorway then stops suddenly in his tracks A horrifying
serpent creature is in the doorway Its concealed in
shadows but enough can be seen to tell its like the serpent
from Matts dream

Matt yells out in shock pointing the gun at the serpent He
fires off a shot as he turns to run The serpent advances
on Matt with incredible speed Right as it reaches Matt it
passes through beams of light cast by a streetlight outside
The serpent reaches out a large scaley hand and grabs Matt
by the shoulder He cries out in pain and drops the gun

CUT TO

WOODS BEHIND DANIELS HOUSE - NIGHT

Daniel makes his way through the trails behind his house
He turns on the flashlight The trails have a very ominous
feel to them The paths seems to narrow and the branches
seem to stick out to catch him in the face

This is so fuckin stupid Where
the hell are you

Movement can be heard in the woods behind Daniel He starts
to quicken his pace

CUT TO

INT MATTHEWS HOUSE - NIGHT

The camera faces toward the wall that Matts parents bed
rests against Above the bed is a painting of an old dog
asleep on an antique bed The picture has a piece of glass
covering it Suddenly Matt flies through air smashing into
the picture Glass shatters as Matt falls onto the bed
Matt rolls onto his back very dazed

OVERHEAD SHOT - MATT ON THE BED
The serpents hand reaches into the shot and grabs Matthew by
the ankle Matt quickly disappears from view as the

creature pulls him off the bed A thud can be heard as Matt
hits the floor

CUT TO

EXT WOODS BEHIND DANIELS HOUSE

Daniel continues to hurriedly make his way through the
woods Off in the distance he can see a faint light coming
from Matts house Suddenly two sets of hands reach out
from behind Daniel grabbing him by the back of his shirt

He spins around holding the flashlight like a club Its
Nick and Adam

DANIEL

Adam nods his head then turns and jogs off back towards
Daniels Daniel and Nick set off at a quick pace towards
Matts house All of a sudden several gunshots ring out
accompanied by several flashes of light coming from the
inside of Matts house

DANIEL
Fuck Come on

Daniel and Nick break out into a full sprint

CUT TO
INT MATTHEWS PARENTS ROOM

Matt thrashes wildly on the floor The serpent creature is
grabbing at his face and arms Matt manages to get the gun
aimed at the creatures torso He squeezes the trigger
firing a single shot into its chest The creature grabs
Matt by the wrist and slings him across the room He hits
the wall above his dads dresser and falls down on top of
it He continues to roll off onto the floor right next to
his bookbag Very disoriented Matt fires off the remaining
shots wildly missing the creature completely The creature
hunches over and spits up blood onto the floor Matt
fumbles through the bookbag trying to find the box of
bullets

He finds the box and snatches it out quickly but the box is
partially open and bullets sling out all over the bedroom
floor The serpent looks up and begins to awkwardly slide
across the floor towards Matt Matt manages to grab a
single bullet off the floor and load it before the creature
is upon him Matt extends his arm out pointing the gun
right at its head With lightning speed the serpent
snatches Matts wrist out of the air It lifts him up off
the ground by his hand Matt has a look of total
bewilderment on his face

Without warning the creature snaps Matts wrist As it
breaks he cries out in pain and drops the gun to the floor
The creature grabs Matt by the neck with its free hand
Without pausing it snaps his neck causing his arms and legs
to go limp It drops him to the floor He lays ina
pathetic pile his eyes staring off into nothing The
creature falls backwards onto the floor It begins to gasp
for air

CUT TO

another flash of light like that created when the gun went

FADE TO

EXT HASHANS HOME - DAY

Hashan rises from his prayer matt He begins to walk
towards sound of the two booming voices As he gets closer
the crowds of people become more tightly packed The crowd
is surging forward Hashan pauses and stares at the moving
bodies Its as if he is about to plunge into human rapids
He braces himself then rushes into the flow of people Hes
knocked back and forth and he forces his way through the
crowd People ahead of him are jumping and shouting
frantically Hashan suddenly gets shoved from behind
falling to his knees The crowd continues to surge forward
knocking him down on his stomach The crowd begins to walk
over him stepping on his back and hands and head He
desperately tries to get up but he keeps getting stepped on
and forced back down to the ground Hashan begins to army
crawl forward along the ground The shouting and commotion
increase the further he goes He continues to get trampled
as one man kicks him in the face It seems hes going to be
trampled to death He weakly picks up his head enough to
see along the ground ahead of him He sees bright flames
rolling across the ground The people ahead of him suddenly
switch directions and start to rush backwards tripping over
him

The camera rises off the ground above the crowd Hashan is
around 15 feet from the edge of the crowd surrounding the
two prophets Brilliant flames shoot from Elikais mouth
into the edge of the crowd There are 3 men with weapons
hat burst into flames The surrounding crowd is frightened
but unharmed by the flames The attackers smoldering
bodies collapse back onto people trying to move away

Several people behind the witnesses break through the crowd
running towards the two ragged men Elikai spins around and
shoots flames from his mouth onto the attacking men The
flames shoot up their bodies engulfing them in colorful
flames The men writhe on the ground for several seconds
before going still Uriah turns towards the spot in the
crowd where Hashan lies He walks forward followed by
Elikai The camera goes to an overhead shot The crowd
forms a ring around the two men As they walk forward the
ring moves with them as the people ahead move back to give
the men room and the ones behind get the courage to get a
little closer The ring of live people is eclipsed by the
ring of dead people burnt to death on the ground Uriah
walks right up to a pile of chard bodies He reaches down
through the ashes and grabs Hashan by the wrist He easily
drags him from under the pile and out into the center of the
circle Elikai walks the perimeter of the circle keeping
the crowd at bay Uriah kneels down beside Hashan

HASHAN
Lord Give me the strength to serve
you Please tell me what to do
Ill do it

Hashan turns his head to the side and spits up a little
blood His breathing is shallow and he acts on the verge of
losing consciousness Uriah places a hand of Hashans
chest He immediately starts breathing normally His eyes
open wider and he becomes more alert

URIAH
Do not despair you have been
chosen to serve the Lord I will
speak plainly so that you may
understand what is asked of you
The deceiver will strike soon
Everything God loves he hates He
would choose to kill all the
children of God all plants all
creatures all things He is known
to you now He is the new leader
of the ten nations

HASHAN
Sebastian Jareb Hes in all the
papers and on TV He speaks of
peace and unity
URIAH
He speaks lies He will only bring
death and darkness

HASHAN
What do you want me to do

URIAH

I am a beggar and servant of God

I want nothing of you It is Gods
will that has brought you here He
holds the keys and knows the paths
Listen carefully to my words for
this is the plan of the Lord

Uriah grabs Hashan by the shoulders and pulls him into a
sitting position He leans forward and begins to speak
softly into Hashans ear Hashan closes his eyes and
listens carefully In the background flames can be seen
pouring out of Elikais mouth into a group of men Uriah
leans back and looks into Hashans eyes

URIAH (CONTD)
Do not be afraid of what is to
come Only believe Have faith
without doubt You can accomplish
all things through Him Now go
prepare the time is close

Hashan stands to his feet and faces towards the direction of
his house Elikai walks up and stands beside Uriah The
two prophets raise a hand toward Hashans home The crowd
is suddenly forced apart making a path like Moses parting
the sea Hashan takes off running through the path The
crowd begins to close back together behind Hashan The two
witnesses lower their hands and walk back to the center of
the circle and begin to resume prophesying in their loud
booming voices

Daniel pauses as he hears movement coming from the woods
ahead of him He raises his head from his hands and wipes
his eyes A gentle breeze begins to blow cooling his face
and drying his eyes He hears a whispering sound Its as
if the wind were whispering to him

WIND-LIKE WHISPER
DanielDaniel

Daniel stands up looking around The sound continues
fading out into the woods Daniel descends down the steps
and walks into the entrance of the woods His figure
disappears into the shadows

Daniel feels his way awkwardly through the woods The moon
provides his only light The breeze continues to blow and
his name continues to be whispered on the wind The breeze
whirlwinds around him dragging leaves with it He turns
with the breeze as if to catch someone running around behind
him As hes almost facing forward again a bright light
suddenly appears and a loud voice sounds

MICHAEL

Daniel

Daniel yells in surprise and falls back to the ground The
camera pans up revealing the glowing body and face of the
angel Michael Daniel shield his eyes with his arm

DANIEL
Why are you here What do you want
from me

MICHAEL

I have come as a light into the
world and whoever believes in Him
should not abide in the darkness
I do not come to judge the world
but to save it

DANIEL
Save it from what Whats going to
happen

MICHAEL

Now is the judgement of this world
Now the ruler of this world will be
cast out A little while longer
the light is with you Walk while
you have the light lest the
darkness overtake you he who walks
in the darkness does not know where
he is going While you have the
light believe in it that you may
become the sons of light
DANIEL
I dont understand

MICHAEL
I still have many things to say to
you but you cannot bear them now

Michael reaches out a hand and places it right above Daniels
head

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Remember always the things which
are impossible with men are
possible with God

Daniel collapses to the ground unconscious As he falls the
screen fades to black

Sebastian sits at a large marble desk looking livid There
is a speaker phone in the middle of his desk

SEBASTIAN

SEBASTIAN

MANS VOICE (V0O)

gas isnt having any effect

SEBASTIAN
Why do they refuse to leave You

people like that running free

ALEK
Do you want me to handle it

SEBASTIAN
No I think I have it under control

end

Alek limps over to a chair in front of Sebastians desk and
sits down He lets out a sigh as if even the walk to the
desk took a lot out of him

ALEK
They are going well very well
actually The banks are preparing
funds to be transferred to the
mark All participating countries
are preparing their people for the
switch

SEBASTIAN
What about the people refusing to
use the mark

ALEK
Ive already taken care of that
Facilities will be set up where
lesser quality foods and goods will
be offered to those not accepting
the mark The prices will be
through the roof and the taxes will
go straight to us Its only a
matter of time before they realize
its pointless to fight the change

SEBASTIAN
Excellent I couldnt have gotten
this far without you Alek You are
a good friend

ALEK
I am no one just a man behind the
scenes You deserve the credit
You deserve the rewards

SEBASTIAN

EXT WOODS BEHIND DANIELS HOUSE - NIGHT
DANIELS POV - WOODS
Daniel wakes up to a dark and blurry image of the woods He

turns towards his house The image of his house is fuzzy
and moving back and forth The screen looks down to the
ground then zooms in on it suddenly as Daniel falls back
down The camera pulls back to show him struggling to get
back up He starts crawling along the ground towards his
house

CALLISTA (0S)
Oh my God Daniel

Callista runs down the steps and over to Daniel He
collapses and rolls onto his back Callista kneels down
beside him

CALLISTA (CONTD)
What happened Whats wrong

Daniel wraps his arms around her neck and pulls himself into
a sitting position He starts to fall backwards but
Callista catches him and holds him in her arms

DANIEL
Michaelhe spoke to me

CALLISTA
What are you talking about

DANIEL
The angel Michael spoke to me He
talked about the judgement of the
worldand the darkness and the
lightyou believe me right

CALLISTA
Of course I do but lets talk
about this inside You need to lie
down
Callista helps Daniel to his feet They make their way back
into the house and into the Daniels room Callista helps
him into his bed

CALLISTA (CONTD)
Get some rest we can talk about
things in the morning ok

DANIEL
No listen Somethings going on
Things arent adding up This
isnt God Cant you feel it I
see the angels I feel the awe I
can sense some kind of power but
nothing about this feels holy
Seeing Michael didnt bring tears
to my eyes I always thought
seeing an angel would bring tears
to my eyes I justI need to
think

CALLISTA
You need to sleep

DANIEL
I cant sleep my face hurts I
think I fell on a rock

Laughing Callista leans over and kisses Daniel on the
cheek

CALLISTA

DANIEL
(grinning)

CALLISTA
I dont know if i can fix squirrel

specialty I guess it wouldnt
hurt to try

DANIEL
I like your style

Callista leans down and kisses Daniel softly on the lips
then leans back

DANIEL (CONTD)
How about I take two and call you
in the morning

Callista giggles and gives Daniel another kiss She gets up
and walks to the doorway She shuts off the light and walks
into the living room where everyone else is already asleep
She quietly climbs into her sleeping bag She rolls onto
her side and looks at the empty couch that Matt used to
sleep on She gets a sad look on her face like shes about
to cry She rolls over onto her other side

EXT ABANDONED FLOWER SHOP - DAY

Hashan knocks on the door of an abandoned flower shop The
windows are boarded up and condemned signs hang on he door
and outside walls There is a peephole in the center of the
door Hashan hears movement from behind the door followed
by the sound of several dead bolts clicking and a doorbar
being removed A very large Arab man with a thick unibrow
and a sub-machine gun answer the door He points the gun at
Hashans head

HASHAN
Wait My names Hashan I was sent
by the two prophets Your names
Orestes They said you wouldnt
kill me

Orestes lowers his gun

ORESTES
What do you want

HASHAN
I need to speak to a man named
Zimri He has a mission for me

Orestes moves back and invites Hashan inside The inside of
the shop is full of dead dried up flowers It looks as if
an entire beautiful garden died all at once and was brought
here for safe keeping Orestes points towards a closed door
behind him

ORESTES
Zimris through there

Hashan walks to the door and looks over his shoulder at
Orestes before turning the door handle and walking through
Zimri sits at an old dirt stained wooden desk Zimri is an
elderly looking Arab He has deep lines in his face but
still has a full head of gray and black hair He also has a
full beard He looks up from his lap as Hashan enters
There are holes all in the ceiling and floor Hashan stands
in front of the desk looking down at Zimri There are no
chairs for him to sit in

HASHAN
My name is Hashan Uriah and
Elikai sent me here to see you
ZIMRI
Yes I know Uriah told me you
would come There isnt much time
so let me get right to the point

Zimri picks up a brief case from beside his chair and sets
it on top of the desk There is a thumb scan where the
combination lock usually would be He places his thumb on
the scan and several seconds later the case pops open

Zimri pulls out several documents They are watermarked and
have government stamping in the center There is a shiny
hologram sticker in the corner of the documents containing
the holy trinity symbol enclosed in a triangle Zimri looks
Hashan directly in the eyes and holds his gaze for a moment

ZIMRI (CONTD)
A lot of people died for these so I
want you to pay close attention
These credentials will get you
into Sebastians complex and within
killing distance of the target

HASHAN
You want me to kill Sebastian

ZIMRI
This task has been graciously given
to you by God himself Would you
be like Jonah and run from your
destiny

HASHAN
No I will not run I will do
anything the Lord asks of me How
will I even get close enough to
Sebastian

ZIMRI

Sebastian believes that tomorrow at
3 in the afternoon he has an
appointment with a reporter to
discuss the new details on the
digital currency known as the mark
While this interview will take

lace the man conducting the
interview has recently changed

HASHAN
Poor bastard

ZIMRI
Orestes made it quick You will
begin the interview tomorrow and
continue until Sebastian is relaxed
and off guard Then you will kill
him

HASHAN
With what The microphone

ZIMRI
With this

Zimri pulls out a black 7 inch blade from the brief case
Hashan looks at it and raises an eyebrow

ZIMRI (CONTD)
To avoid metal detection it has
been made entirely of plastic It
is also coated with a highly
flammable substance After killing
Sebastian you will set the knife
on fire and make your way to the
exit A car will be waiting for
you You are guaranteed a 10
minute window to escape starting
from the time you light the blade

HASHAN
Guaranteed by whom

ZIMRI
A man within Sebastians
organization Hes the only reason
any of this is possible You can
meet him when this is all over
Now go home and get some rest
Orestes will pick you up tomorrow
at 1 from your home

Zimri places the blade and the documents back into the brief
case and closes it He take a device resembling a palm
pilot from his pocket and hands it to Hashan

ZIMRI (CONTD)
Place your thumb in the center

Hashan does as he is told The screen lights up as he
presses his thumb into the center A few seconds later the
screen goes dim and Hashan removes his thumb There is a
digital thumbprint left on the screen He hands the device
back to Zimri

ZIMRI (CONTD)
By tomorrow this case will only
open for you

Hashan opens his mouth to speak but cant find the words
He turns and exits the room Orestes is standing by the
front door waiting for him He opens the door and ushers
Hashan outside

ORESTES
Go with God Hashan You will need
him tomorrow Oh and wear a suit
tomorrow Youll need to look like
a reporter

Hashan nods and starts to walk away from the shop Orestes
closes the door and walks back into Zimris office

ORESTES (CONTD)
Do you think we can trust him

ZIMRI

Hashan was sent by the prophets

He is driven by his faith He will
do what has been asked

ORESTES

I meant the other one The man on
the inside Are you sure we can
trust him

ZIMRI
I asked Uriah that very question

ORESTES
What did he say

ZIMRI
He told me it was not for me to
know the times or the seasons
which the Father has put in His own
power He said Let your heart not
be troubled neither let it be
afraid Then he said the way has
already been prepared that all I
needed now was faith

ORESTES
Faith is a powerful thing

ZIMRI
When our path is covered in
darkness faith will light the way

HASHANS HOME - DAY

Hashan stands in front of his bedroom mirror
a dark grey business suit with a light blue collared shirt

underneath and adjusting a navy blue tie

FADE TO

Hes wearing

His hair is

slicked over to the side like a little boys combover He
stands up straight and holds his head high
dignified but there is a great sadness in his eyes He
glances to the left at a clock on the wall

1252

his front door
to look at the family portrait

He looks

The time reads
He exits his room and walks down his hall towards
He stops at the row of pictures and turns
He touches a hand to the
picture and a tear runs down his cheek Outside he hears a
car horn sound Hashan stares at the photo for a few
moments

HASHAN
This is for you my babies

Hashan wipes the tear from his face and walks to the front
door He opens it and exits into the front yard The sky
is full of meteorites burning brightly overhead Orestes
is parked in a blue trailblazer Hashan gets in on the
passenger side

INT ORESTESS CAR

Before Hashans door is fully shut Orestes takes off down
the road kicking up dust

ORESTES
Sorry running a little behind
Did you sleep well

HASHAN
No not really

ORESTES
Good Good Now listen

Orestes reaches into the back seat and pulls out the brief
case He hands it to Hashan

ORESTES (CONTD)
The case has been adjusted to your
thumbprint Only you can open it
now Go ahead and take out the
knife

Hashan places his thumb on the scanner and several seconds
later the case pops open He pulls out the knife then holds
it out in front of him staring at it

ORESTES (CONTD)
Place the knife in your inside
jacket pocket

HASHAN
Wont they search me Why dont I
just keep it in the case

ORESTES
You have an appointment and
government credentials Unless the
metal detectors go off you will
not be searched And besides the
knife can still be seen through an
x-ray machine There is an ID pass
in the top of the case to wear on
the outside of your coat

Hashan places the blade inside his jacket then takes out the
press pass from the case and clips it to the outside of his
coat Hashan stares out the window watching the trees go
by They continue making their way into the center of the
city They soon arrive at a large 10 story building

HASHAN
Where are we

ORESTES
This is where Sebastians people
wanted to conduct the interview
Security reasons I suppose Are
you having doubts

HASHAN
No Im fine Where will I meet
you when its done

Orestes points across the street in the parking lot of a
bakery Orestes pulls up in front of the entrance ramp to
the building He puts the car in park then pops the trunk

ORESTES
Your interview equipment is in the
back Take a few moments to
familiarize yourself with it before
entering the building You dont
want to seem incompetent to
Sebastian

HASHAN
Ill be fine

ORESTES
Ok good luck

Hashan gets out with the briefcase in hand He walks to the
back of the trailblazer and pulls out a black dufflebag He
takes a deep breath and walks up the ramp and into the
building

INT 10 STORY BUILDING

The first floor is a long hallway with a security checkpoint
in the center and several elevators behind it Hashan looks
down at his ID tag It says the name Jacob Bale and has his
photo at the bottom as well as the holy trinity hologram
below it He boldly walks straight up to the check point
and lays his brief case and dufflebag on the x-ray conveyor
belt He turns to the closest guard

HASHAN
Jacob Bale here to see Mr Jareb
for a 3 oclock interview My
papers are in the brief case

GUARD
Step through the metal detector
please

Hashan takes a quick breathe and holds it while he walks
through the detectors No alarms sounds He breathes out
through his nose and strides over to his brief case
confidently and opens it with the thumbscan He hands the
stack of documents to the guard While the guard checks
them over Hashan stares around taking in his surroundings
He looks up noticing a surveillance camera pointed right at
him He smiles weakly then looks down at the floor

The camera cuts to the inside of a small security room

There is enough room for one man to sit comfortably at a
desk On top of the desk are a dozen surveillance monitors
and keyboard with a joystick built into it There is a
black polished barreta beside the keyboard The back of
the mans head is turned to the screen hiding his face On
all the TV monitors are a closeup view of Hashans face

The man has an open folder in his lap and is flipping
through several pages He pulls back on the joystick and
the camera zooms out showing Hashan and the guards

The camera cuts back to Hashan He looks over at the guard

HASHAN
I hate to sound rude but I dont
want to be late for this interview
Is it ok for me to go up

GUARD
Yeah go ahead

The camera cuts back inside the security office The man
picks up a phone on the far end of the desk and presses a
button on the side On the security monitor we see a phone
ring on the wall beside the guard He answers the phone

GUARD (V0O) (CONTD)
Yes sir

The camera swings around to the front of the man revealing
him to be Sebastians right hand man Alek

ALEK
Hold him

Alek hangs up the phone and tosses the papers in his lap
onto the desk He then stands up and picks the gun up off
the desk and puts it in a holster under his arm Alek
quickly leaves the room The camera stays in the room
looking at the desk It zooms in on the stack of papers
The top paper contains a photo of a young clean shaven white
man Under the photo is the name Jacob Bale

The camera cuts back to the security check point The guard
hangs up the phone and grabs Hashan by the arm

GUARD
Wait here a moment

HASHAN
Is something wrong

GUARD
Just wait please

Hashan stares down the hallways towards the elevators at the
far end A sign above the elevator door against the far
wall flashes indicating an incoming elevator

HASHAN
(sounding frustrate)
I dont understand the holdup Is
something wrong

The guard puts his hand on his sidearm

GUARD
Remain calm My supervisor would
simply like to have a word with
you

The elevator door opens Alek steps out and stares
suspiciously at Hashan He shuffles down the hall never
taking his eyes off him

ALEK
(smirking)
Mr Bale how are you today

HASHAN
Im fine whats the problem

ALEK
Nothing I hope

Alek walks right up to Hashan and starts to pat him down
He starts at his arms and then moves down his legs then
moves back up to his ribs then chest He pauses as he pats
over Hashans breast pocket He pats the knife several
times

ALEK (CONTD)
Hmmm Whats this

Alek reaches into Hashans left pocket instead and pulls out
a cheap plastic lighter
ALEK (CONTD)
I hope you dont plan on lighting a
cigarette for Mr Jareb with this

Alek pulls out a beautifully engraved zippo lighter
encrusted with three small diamonds He also takes out a
pack of cigarettes Hashan stares at the lighter

ALEK (CONTD)
Use this Lights every time

Alek places the lighter and cigarettes into Hashans left
pocket

ALEK (CONTD)
Dont forget to return that on your
way out Good luck with your
interview

Alek smiles then turns and walks back towards the elevators
Hashan puts the documents back in his case then grabs the
dufflebag and hurries after Alek When they reach the
elevators Alek points a hand towards an elevator to his
right

ALEK (CONTD)
This is you Seventh floor Room

Both elevators open simultaneously Both men step into
their corresponding elevators Both doors close in unison

CUT TO

7TH FLOOR

Hashan exits the elevator and makes his way down a winding
hallway until he gets to room 313 He closes his eyes and
mumbles a quick prayer He opens his eyes and knocks firmly
on the door

SEBASTIAN (0S)
Come in

Hashan enters the room It is plainly decorated with a
large conference table on the left Sebastian stands to the
right of the room staring out a large glass window He
turns towards Hashan

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Hello Jacob are you ready to
begin

HASHAN
Of course Please have a seat
while I set up It will just take
a moment

Hashan sets down the dufflebag on the table as Sebastian
takes two chairs and sets them in the middle of the room
around three feet apart Hashan sets up the camera by the
table and presses a few buttons to make it look like hes
turning it on He takes out a portable microphone and hands
it to Sebastian to clip onto his tie The two men sit down
in the chairs Sebastian stares at Hashan smiling for a
moment then raises an eyebrow curiously

SEBASTIAN
Are you ready

HASHAN
Oh yes lets begin First
question Ummm ok the UN Mark
If this is a completely digital
currency does that mean everyone
will be given a special credit
card orhow will you do that

SEBASTIAN
Thats a good question and Im glad
you asked it We have devised a
permanent electronic stamp of sorts
that will be placed on the top of
the right hand or for people who
dont have a right hand the most
convenient location

Sebastians eyes dart quickly to the camera then back to
Hashan

HASHAN
(curiously)
And what will this stamp look like

SEBASTIAN
Like this

Sebastian holds up his right hand with the top facing
Hashan There is a blue shimmering set of three connected
rings inside a triangle

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Pretty cool huh The best part is
people can pick whatever color they
want Now the three rings
represent the joining of countries
together Kind of like the symbol
of the Olympics The triangle is
used to symbolize the joined
countries forming a single
connected society People will
simply swipe their hand across a
special scanner and a purchase or
transaction will be made

Sebastians eyes dart toward the camera again then back to
Hashan Hashan notices this time and looks towards the
camera then back to Sebastian

HASHAN
Something wrong

SEBASTIAN
I dont seem to sound rude or
embarrass you but I dont think
your camera is turned on Isnt
there supposed to be some kind of
light turned on

Hashan freezes for a moment and stares at the camera He
quickly becomes alert again and starts to laugh He stands
up and walks over to the camera

HASHAN
Its on This old thing The
light sometimes cuts off I really
should look into a new one

Hashan turns his back to Sebastian He scans the camera and
finally finds the power switch He discretely turns the
camera on without Sebastian noticing He taps the side of
the video camera a couple times then moves out of the way so
Sebastian can see the light

SEBASTIAN
Ah there she goes

Hashan turns back towards the video camera He reaches
inside his jacket and pulls out the knife He stashes it up
his right sleeve He turns and walks back over to his chair
and sits down He offers a weak smile to Sebastian who
smiles warmly back

HASHAN
Can I offer you a cigarette

SEBASTIAN
Of course thank you

Hashan reaches into his left pocket with his left hand and
pulls out the pack of cigarettes He flicks his wrist
forwards causing one to stick out of the top Sebastian
takes the cigarette and places it between his lips With
his right arm down by his side Hashan slowly lets the blade
drop down into his right hand Hashan returns the pack and
takes out the lighter

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Thats a beautiful lighter Where
did you get it

HASHAN
From a friend

Sebastian leans forward so Hashan can light his cigarette
Hashan lights the zippo and holds it out towards Sebastian
Sebastian closes his eyes while he leans forward a little
more to light the cigarette Hashan stares at his exposed
neck He shakes slightly in anticipation He closes his
eyes and tries to mentally prepare himself

A closeup image of Matthew with his eyes closed flashes
momentarily on the screen

The camera INTERCUTS between Hashan and Matthew both slowly
opening their eyes

The camera cuts back to Matthews face His mouth is open
slightly and his face seems frozen in place His eyes dart
madly all around The camera zooms out just enough to
reveal Matthew lying on his back on a dark metal floor The
bones at Matts wrist and neck press out slightly stretching
the skin giving the appearance they are still very much
broken

The camera cuts back to Hashan and Sebastian They both
lean back in their chairs Hashan looks down shamefully at
the floor as Sebastian takes a long drag off his cigarette

The camera cuts back to Matthew His body remains
motionless and his eyes frantically scan the room Suddenly
a bright light flashes at the bottom of the screen below
Matts feet The camera pans up his body until it reaches
his upper half showing his torso outstretched arms and
head The light goes away and moments later an arm comes
into the screen with its hand directly above Matts chest
The hand glows faintly as Matts body raises up off the
ground into the air until it reaches the outstretched hand
Matthews body hangs limp in the air

The camera cuts back to Hashan and Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
Jacob are you all right

HASHAN
(whispering)
I cant do it
Sebastian turns his head to exhale

SEBASTIAN
Cant do what
INTERCUTTING

Suddenly Hashan lunges at Sebastian and drives the blade
into the side of his throat the hand glows bright white as
Matts body tenses up His arms legs and head contract
And the broken places on his neck and wrist glow slightly
brighter

Sebastian tumbles over the side of his chair onto the floor
A look of pain shock and fear are painted on his face He
clutches the side of his throat as he gasps for air

INTERCUTTING

Blood flows freely from Sebastians mouth and throat a
bright white liquid flows freely from Matts mouth and eyes

Hashan stumbles backwards and trips on his chair falling to
the floor He looks toward Sebastian Sebastians body is
hidden behind the chair but his legs can be seen thrashing

about Hashans eyes go wide as Sebastian places a bloody
hand on the side of his chair and starts to force himself to
his feet Sebastian stares directly into Hashans eyes then

turns towards the door He takes a few steps forward then

collapses to the ground Hashan stays frozen in place A

heavy dragging sound can be heard as Sebastian tries to drag
himself to the door Sebastian paws at the handle but
cant get a grip due to the blood all over his hands He
finally gets a grip and slowly starts to turn the handle
when his body finally shuts down and his arm falls to the
floor with a thump

Hashan slowly gets up and walks over to Sebastians body
His eyes are still open but hes clearly dead There is a
large pool of blood underneath him as well as blood all
down the front of his body Hashan bends down and taks a
hold of the blad of the knife

HASHAN
God forgive me

Hashan closes his eyes and pulls the blade out He holds it
in his hand watching the blood drip off onto the floor
below He walks over to the conference table and sets the
knife down He pulls the lighter from his pocket and flicks
the top open He pauses and turns towards the camera The
power light seems to shine brightly showing that its still
running and captured the entire event Hashan shudders and
turns the power off He takes out the tape and sets it on
top of the knife He lights the lighter The flame burns
brightly He slowly guides his hand toward the knife The
flame is only inches away from the tip of the blade when a
blinding light suddenly flashes from across the room The
flame of the lighter is instantly extinguished Hashan
staggers back and raises his arm to shield his eyes The
light begins to fade and he slowly lowers his arm

INTERCUTTING

Three ominous and menacing angels stand together hovering
several inches off the ground facing Hashan an angel stands
with its back turned to the screen its hand pressed to
Matts chest Matts body has become a silhouette of white
light

Hashan cries out and falls to his knees The angels look
down at Sebastians body then back toward Hashan

HASHAN
(yelling loudly)
Ive done whats been asked of me

MIDDLE ANGEL
And you have done it well
Therefore we will show unto you
the truth and the light so in
your final moments you might
understand

Time slows down as the three angels glide slowly and
effortlessly across the floor towards Hashan They
simultaneously place a hand in the center of their chest and
press something All three of the angels faces begin to
dissolve away followed by their entire bodies Their image
seems to flow into their chest

The camera cuts to the screaming face of Hashan

HASHAN
(screaming hysterically)
No No God no

The camera cuts back towards the oncoming angels Where the
angels once stood there are now three terrifying and
hideous serpent creatures They all have harness-like
electronic bands all over their bodies as if it were some
type of suit The two aliens on the left and right each
ball up their right fist A brilliant blue flame springs up
out of their right hands The middle angel stands still
The handle of a massive sword on his back can be seen
sticking out beside his head

Hashan turns and bolts for the door From offscreen two
balls of blue flame fly past Hashans head and slam into the
door Its immediately engulfed in the unnatural blue fire
Hashan turns towards the serpents and drops to his knees

He holds his arms out and bows his head signaling his
surrender From offscreen a vertical blue line around 5
feet tall flies through the air cutting off Hashans left
hand and slicing a line into the wall behind him Hashan
clutches his bloody stump and falls to the floor on his
side

The camera cuts back to the serpents The alien in the
middle is holding the gigantic blade It glows a
fluorescent blue that fades until the sword is the color of
steel again Suddenly the sword glows brightly again as the
serpent raises it over his head and brings it swiftly down
again A blue vertical shockwave shoots out from the blade
going offscreen towards where Hashan lays

The camera cuts to Hashan only showing him from the chest
up His eyes bulge and his body contracts briefly then his
face and arm fall limply to the floor

The middle alien turns toward Sebastian He takes a small
orb-like device out of the middle of his chest He holds
the sword in one hand and points the orb with the other at
Sebastians body A bright white light shoots out of the
orb and scans up and down Sebastians body After a moment
the light goes off and the alien puts the orb back into his
chest He presses a button on the orb and it begins to glow
brightly Different colored liquid-like substances pour out
of the orb and begin to cover the serpents body He glows
momentarily white then the light fades revealing the body of
Sebastian He turns towards the other aliens

ALIEN-SEBASTIAN
Get the blade and the tape
Theres much to be done

CUT TO

INT DARK ROOM

The camera cuts back to Matts floating body and the
concealed angel leaning over him The light fades from
Matts body and he starts to lower gently to the ground As
he lowers the camera swings around to reveal the angel to be
Michael As Matts body reaches the ground he suddenly
goes into convulsions then goes rigid As quickly as it
started it stops and his body becomes still Just then
lights come on revealing Matt is lying in a large pool of
blood Matts eyes slowly open and he rolls onto his side
seeing the blood He quickly sits upright and sees Michael
He yells in shock and scoots back against the wall Out of
the corner of his eye he notices a huddled mass to his
left He turns and looks Its the dead body of the
serpent that had attacked him in his parents bedroom Matt
cries out again and jumps up looking wildly around There
are strange electronic devices screens and sounds The
ceiling is made of a vibrant blue glass-like material The
walls seem almost alive as they vibrate slowly like the
walls in Matts dream

In a strange twist Hashan not only
taped the horrible murder but also
left the tape as evidence before
killing himself While many
questions remain unanswered
Sebastians chief of staff and
personal aid Alek Bardo had this
statement to make

The screen cuts to a red-eyed trembling Alek

reading a

prepared statement

ALEK
Sebastian was the most important
leader and political figure of our
time I dont know why anyone
would want to kill him I have
personally reviewed the tape and
while after the murder takes place
the quality of the tape rapidly
diminishes its still all the
proof we need This
administration has agreed that the
tape will be publicly broadcast one
time tonight and one time only We
do this in hopes that the world may

He begins
know the truth and not get half-
truths other sources In addition
we have several guards in custody
for questioning Hashan had to
have had someone on the inside
helping him

Alek breaks down into tears

ALEK (CONTD)

(sobbing)
Sebastian was a great man and a
true friend He spoke of peace and
unity I only pray I can pick up
where he left off I have no
further statements at this time
Thank you

Uriah and Elikai stand in the middle of a massive crowd
Elikai holds a young girl in his arms Both of the girls
legs are shriveled and twisted up Uriah places a hand on
each of the girls legs Uriahs hands begin to glow with
white light The light in his hands spreads into the young
girls legs She cries out as her legs are soon covered in
the intense white light An older woman stands at the edge
of the crowd holding a hand over her mouth trying to
suppress her own sobbing Moments later the light fades
from the girls legs and Uriahs hands The crowd gasps
The camera cuts to a shot of the girls legs They look
normal and healthy A loud cheer echoes through the mass of
people Elikai walks over to the woman and hands her the
child As the woman clutches the girl in her arms Elikai
glances up to see two helicopters in the distance
approaching fast The sky is full of cumulus clouds
Elikai takes several steps back toward the center of the
crowd

It all started with a lie In the
early 1940s your people began
producing nuclear energy on a
massive scale While you
government admitted there was
nuclear waste being produced they
failed to mention that once it is
created it cannot be destroyed or
contained Sealed barrels
containing nuclear waste were
buried miles underground only to
rupture and spread through the
soil killing entire communities

CUT TO

The land between the prophets and the helicopter is bare
ground with a few shrubs along the way The nearest town or
city is several miles away Elikai and Uriah both look to
the sky Two giant wings spread out from both Elikais and
Uriahs back Their hair begins to shimmer looking almost
golden Their ragged robes dissolve away revealing
beautifully engraved angelic armor A brightness
intensifies in their eyes Elikai throws out his hand
toward the crowd in the direction of the helicopters The
crowd forces apart clearing a path straight through He
and Uriah take off running down the dirt road

INT HELICOPTER
PILOTS POV - CROWD

There is a massive crowd of several hundred people bunched
together in a clearing A path suddenly splits through the
crowd Two winged figures can be seen running toward the
helicopters with incredible speed The camera moves back to
the fuselage There are two men dressed in tactical gear
loading large sniper rifles Both sides of the helicopter
are opened up The camera continues to move back exiting
the helicopter It moves into the second chopper and into
the fuselage There are two men in this one as well The
first man is also a sniper The second man is the alien
disguised as Sebastian He stares out the open side of
the Helicopter at the two prophets He clutches the hilt of
the sword he used to kill Hashan

CUT TO

INT TRANSPORT ROOM

MICHAEL
In 1958 your government created
NASA for the sole purpose of
developing rockets to launch the
nuclear waste into space All
other early missions mentioned to
the public were lies And so it
went mission after mission rocket
after rocket They fired the waste
into space never to be seen again

CUT TO

ISRAEL

The camera cuts back to Uriah and Elikai There is now only
a 30 yard gap between the men and the helicopters Uriah
balls up his right fist Blue flames spring up out of his
hand Suddenly he leaps into the air level with the
helicopters He opens his fist shooting out a large blue
fireball 5 feet in diameter It flies through the air with
a shimmering vapor trail behind it Moments before it
connects with the lead helicopter both aircraft bank hard
to the left Sebastians helicopter pulls up as the other
drops dangerously close to the ground The fireball misses
but the lead chopper ends up almost level on the ground with
the open side facing Elikai Elikai doesnt hesitate as he
opens his mouth and spews a stream of fire into the fuselage
of the chopper lighting both of the snipers on fire and
well as the aircraft itself Sebastians chopper swings
around behind the two prophets The sniper leans out the
side takes aim and fires Uriah spins around to face the
sniper just as a bullet rips through his left shoulder As
Uriah falls to the ground the image of his left wing and
arm dissolve away to show a bloody serpent arm underneath
The flaming chopper begins to pull up but suddenly explodes
and crashes into the ground 40 feet from the two prophets
Shrapnel flies through the air barely missing the two men
Sebastians chopper hovers 30 feet in the air with its side
facing Elikai and Uriah Uriah clutches his left arm to his
body as he balls his right fist tightly He has a look of
extreme anger on his face Tall blue flames flicker wildly
about his hand and arm as he gets to his feet The sniper
takes aim at Elikais head

My ancestors were explorers always
looking for a new species new
cultures and new ideas Like
yourselves we searched for a
meaning to our existence We were
sure the key was out there
somewhere waiting to be found We
never thought the answer could be
in our own hearts In our very
souls One day my people thought
they had found an answer There
was rumored to be a newly
discovered planet and species to
investigate They were known as
Humans and they had something my
people had never heard of They
had God A holy creator that
controlled the heavens and the
earth The creator of the universe
and everything in it Including
us

Uriah opens his hand releasing another fireball this time 7
feet in diameter It flies with great speed toward the
opening in the side of the helicopter Seconds before it
connects Sebastian still holding the sword rolls out the
other side of the chopper and begins to free-fall through
the air The massive fireball explodes inside the
helicopter ripping it into several pieces As Sebastian
falls toward the ground two wings dramatically spring out
of his back and he slows immediately floating gently to the
ground about 20 feet from the two prophets His clothes
dissolve away revealing similar angelic armor The pieces
of the chopper crash into the ground sending more debris
flying Uriah and Elikai stare at Sebastian with almost
unbelieving looks on their faces Sebastians sword begins
to glow brightly

MICHAEL
My people went looking for a new
planet for a new hope It was
shortly after entering your solar
system that they found the fated
rocket In their ignorance they
believed it to be some kind of
gift welcoming them to the place
where the soul lives forever So
they brought the rocket on board
their ship and opened it up
Immediately the crew became
infected their bodies reacting
terribly to the radiation It was
in that moment the virus was
created It spread through the
ship like a plague of locusts
devouring anyone it touched then
moving on always moving on The
virus could kill in hours or even
take up to days at a time

CUT TO
ISRAEL

Without warning Sebastian swings the blade vertically at
Elikai A vertical beam shoots out tearing through the
earth Elikai dives out of the way just in time to avoid
it Elikai rolls into a crouching position and opens his
mouth bearing his teeth and spewing flames at Sebastian
Sebastian jumps high into the air avoiding the fire Behind
him there are dark storm clouds Sebastian swings the
sword back and forth diagonally raining down deadly beams at
Uriah and Elikai They both dive through the air The
beams slam and cut into the earth kicking up a giant cloud
of dust

The camera cuts to behind Sebastian looking down into the
cloud of dust Sebastian begins to float his way slowly
back towards the ground Suddenly a massive blue flame ball
shoots up through the dust cloud at Sebastian He quickly
reacts bringing the sword down and sending a thin beam into
the fire The ball erupts 6 feet before reaching Sebastian
A small shock wave slams into him sending him tumbling
through the air into the thick cloud of smoke Faint
outlines of blue flames dance through the smoke Finally
Sebastian is thrown out the side of the cloud landing on his
back and dropping the sword Sebastian rolls onto his side
and spits out blood into the dirt He grits his bloody
teeth together as he tries to get up He reaches for the
sword Elikai appears out of the dust cloud already
breathing flames from his mouth A concentrated column
flows from his mouth and rolls up the side of Sebastians
arm The image of Sebastians human arm dissolves away and
he screams out in pain clutching his burnt arm to his chest
Uriah appears behind Elikai his fist is balled up and a
blue flame is growing in his hand

SEBASTIAN
Why do you fight me The fleet
approaches regardless You will
die for your treachery

ELIKAT
This world is not for you It is
special and unique There is soul
in this place There is a holy
secret locked in every living
thing We must embrace the soul of
the Earth

SEBASTIAN
I will rip out the soul of this
world and devour it whole I will
kill them all Every man woman
and child Even their God himself
I am the beginning and the end I
am the avenger of blood

URIAH
Avenger of ashes your bones will
burn

Uriah steps in front of Elikai He raises his hand toward
Sebastian

CUT TO

INT TRANSPORT ROOM

MICHAEL
And then the ships leader did
something even more foolish than
when he brought the rocket on
board He set a return course to
our home planet Then he died
There was no warning for those back
home No time to prepare When
the ship entered the atmosphere it
broke apart scattering the virus
to the wind It did not take long
after that We used to inhabit two
planets They were almost
identical in environment The
names of the planets would
translate into your words as
Brother and Sister Brother held
our main population which is where
the ship crashed They were able
to evacuate millions from Brother
but compared to three billion
deaths the evacuation was a
failure But the sorrow does not
end there

CUT TO

ISRAEL

Suddenly before Uriah can fire the dark clouds overhead
open up and heavy rain begins to pour down The fire in
Uriahs hand goes out Thick white smoke pours out of his
fist Elikai pulls Uriah back and opens his mouth to spit
flames onto Sebastian Only white smoke pours out of his
mouth He chokes and gasps for air falling to his knees
Sebastian lays on his back for a moment letting the rain hit
his face He begins to laugh maliciously He picks up his
sword and rises to his feet Because their appearances are
holograms all three men remain dry except for Uriahs and
Sebastians exposed arm

SEBASTIAN
How does it go The Lord works in
mysterious ways Fools
Sebastian swings the sword horizontally at the two prophets
Uriah manages to duck in time but Elikai remains standing
still As Uriah ducks the camera ducks down with him
showing only the lower half of Elikai As Uriah stands back
up he cries out and staggers back Elikais body is still
that of an angel but his head is reverted back to a
serpents A Mechanical device covers his mouth Small
amounts of white smokes still leak out of it Seconds
later Elikais head falls to the ground and his body
collapses Uriah is only a few feet from Sebastian He
lunges forward Sebastian swings the massive down towards
Uriahs collar bone

Several of the evacuees had been
infected so all of the ships were
forced to remain in orbit around
Sister until a solution could be
found Three years and several
thousand deaths later a group of
scientists created a vaccine that
could completely block all deadly
effects of the radiation to our
bodies

Michael takes several steps closer to Matthew Matt remains
silent and pressed against the wall

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Even to this day Brother is
useless All plant and animal life
were destroyed We have spent
years pumping the vaccine into the
atmosphere with hopes we can
someday return and live Brother
and Sister together again It is
like a fairy tale to our young

Michael pauses with a faint smile on his face as if
remembering the story when he was young His smile soon
fades and he stares coldly at Matt

MICHAEL (CONTD)
After the cure was found we
immediately began to plana
counterattack For all we knew
the rockets were just the
beginning A way to soften us up
If this were true then a full
attack might kill our entire race
We gave your people too much credit
and acted with caution If we had
not been so careful then you would
all be dead by now

CUT TO

ISRAEL

Uriah raises his left arm up in time to block the sword

The blade sinks deep into his skin all the way to the bone
With his free hand Uriah punches Sebastian in the center of
the chest with a fierce desperation The sword dislodges
from Uriahs arm as Sebastian flies back through the air
several feet He lands hard on his back Blood is now
pooling on the ground beneath Uriah

CUT TO

INT TRANSPORT ROOM

MICHAEL
It was decided we would send a
research team to study your planet
while an invasion fleet was being
built on Sister I am one of the
leaders of that research team I
was given my position because my
father played a key role in the
development of the cure for the
virus He even cured my mother of
the virus while she was pregnant
with me I have never told anyone
but because of the virus I was
born with a gift I have had
dreams and visions my entire life
I hear voices when no one is
around I used to think I was sick
until I came here and discovered
the truth God has been talking to
me using me and those like me to
accomplish his will

The camera fixes on Uriah as he sways and staggers around
He looks up to the sky and closes his eyes

URIAH
Lord look past the flesh and see
that my soul is yours Take me to
paradise
Uriahs head drops forward and his body begins to fall
Before his knees are even fully bent Sebastians sword
plunges deep into the center of his chest Uriah makes no
additional movement and hangs limply on the sword The
Image of the prophet slowly dissolves away leaving a dead
rain-soaked bloody serpents body Sebastian lays Uriah
down then slowly removes the blade from his chest The
rain begins to die out and light starts to shine through the
clouds Sebastian looks up and smirks A bright light
suddenly shines from behind him He turns quickly his
sword raised to strike Alek stands grinning

SEBASTIAN
(sternly)
I told you I could handle things
I did not need your help

ALEK
I know I merely took away their
advantage You did the rest my
king

Alek walks over to look at the two dead prophets He turns
back towards Sebastian still grinning

Sebastians resurrection I will
stay here and clean things up

light then disappears

We began to study everything about
you As we expected your people
had a large capacity for violence

began to intensify God would

Orestes pokes his large head through the opening in the
doorway He stares at Zimri for a moment then walks into
the room He has an overall look of depression about him
He has dark circles under his eyes and his shoulders are
hunched forward as if hes almost lost the will to stand
He remains in front of Zimris desk with his head drooped
down and his eyes fixed on the floor

ZIMRI (CONTD)
Orestes why are you so troubled
Have we not been over this several
times already Hashans death was
not your fault He died doing
Gods work He died honorably

Orestes begins to rub his eyes slowly His body trembles
slightly He looks up suddenly appearing very upset

ORESTES

Their bodies are missing There
are even rumors that Sebastian
walks as an angel You know what
this means

ZIMRI
Calm yourself we knew this da

coldly at his right hand The UN Mark shines bright red in
the sunlight JZimri fights back tears He pulls out a set
of black gloves from his pocket and quickly puts them on

ZIMRI
Forgive me Lord

He turns and walks towards the main cargo area The camera
follows him down a flight of stairs around several turns
and finally into a dimly lit holding area There are dozens
of cargo containers in this holding area Several dark
figures can be seen moving through the shadows around the

Orestes turns to a container behind him There is a digital
keypad on the door He punches in a series of combinations
A green light flashes on the keypad and the door begins to
automatically open Several fluorescent lights click on
There are hundreds of guns lining both walls and even the
ceiling of the container Crates of ammo line the perimeter
of the floor stacked three cases high There is a narrow
walkway leading to the back of the container In the back
pressed against the wall is a large metal crate with a
large blue cross painted on the front Orestes looks at
Zimris right hand as Zimri enters the container

Orestes follows Zimri into the container as the three armed
guards stand watch by the door
Zimri walks right up to the crate while Orestes stands
behind him looking over his shoulder

EXT WEMBLEY STADIUM - UNITED KINGDOM - DAY

A crowd of around eighty thousand pack Wembley Stadium

They all bear the UN Mark on their hands Sebastian stands
on a raised platform surrounded by camera and microphones
Sebastian appears to look like a normal man There are two
massive TV screens behind him displaying his image as he
speaks To the right of Sebastian there is a lower
platform On that platform there is an eight foot high wall
covered with a red velvet curtain Alek stands beside the
curtain holding a rope attached to the curtain He stares
affectionately up at Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
Behold As many of you have seen I
was murdered in cold blood but now
I stand before you resurrected by
God himself

A large cheer sounds throughout the crowd

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
God has breathed his holy breath
into me and created something new
a union of man and angel a
messenger of truth

As the crowd begins to cheer again Sebastians wings
dramatically spread out causing many to gasp and several to
bow down and pray A few in the crowd even faint

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Do no fear me I only wish to
bring peace love and light during
these dark times I know there are
many of you with questions There
are countless crimes committed
daily rampant natural disasters
strange murders and even people
vanishing before our very eyes
These are all signs that we need to
change We need to unify as a
single people under one God

As the crowd cheers the camera pans up slightly The
constant meteor shower in the sky seems to increase the
fire trails burning even brighter The camera pans back
down to Sebastian

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
God has showed me the way The
mark will help bring us all
together One governing body one
monetary system one holy symbol
taken by all to show their faith in
God and one another

Alek claps his hands with exaggerated enthusiasm and smiles
out on the crowd

ALEK
(clapping excitedly)
YesYes

Sebastian suddenly throws his hands out silencing the
crowd As he speaks the loudness of his voice intensifies

SEBASTIAN
But make no mistake This is a
holy war now There are those for
Godand those against him

Sebastian points down towards the covered wall Alek pulls
the long cord and the curtain parts Screams and gasps echo
through the crowd The two dead serpent bodies of Elikai
and Uriah hang from the wall by chains Elikais head has
been reattached held in place with surgical staples

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Do not fear They are dead slain
by my own hands Hell has opened
up and Satan has let these serpents
loose upon our world I see your
frightened faces but there is
still hope Take the mark of God
and you will be protected No one
with the mark can come to harm from
these creatures Deny the mark
and God will deny you his holy
protection The choice is yours
but a decision must be made This
very hour you must choose your
side

As Sebastian says the last words of his speech the camera
pans up to one of the large viewing screens behind him The
camera zooms in on the viewing screen until it takes up the
camera screen The camera then zooms out to reveal the view
screen to now be the screen of Daniels TV in his living
room

INT DANIELS HOUSE

The camera cuts to the faces of Daniel and all of his house
guests gathered around the TV Their jaws are literally
dropped Nobody makes a sound they just stare in shock at
the TV

DANIEL
What the fuck

NICK
Did that really just happen

RYAN
This is really some end of times
shit isnt it

DANIEL
What the fuck

RYAN
So hes saying if we dont get that
mark Satan is going to kill us

SARAH
This is too much

Everyone sits silently for a moment thinking to themselves
Suddenly there is a loud knocking at the door Everyone
turns to look at the door Daniel stands up

DANIEL
Ill get it

Daniel gets up and heads for the front door He looks
nervous as he reaches for the doornob He checks the
peephole but can only see a large shirt and tie taking up
the entire viewing area The persons head is too high up
to be seen He hears somebody walking up behind him and
turns to see Nick and Adam They dont say anything but
nod towards the door to show their support Daniel nods and
turns back to the door As Daniel opens the door he
immediately takes a step back Orestes stands in a business
suit and tie and a full thick beard He takes up the entire
doorway

DANIEL (CONTD)
Who the hell are you

ORESTES
Orestes Can we come in
DANIEL
We
Orestes takes a step backwards and turns sideways JZimri

can be seen walking up the steps looking professional and
cool Daniel glances past Zimri out into the street in
front of his house There is a flatbed trailer parked in
the road On top of the flatbed is the cargo container
carrying the weapons There is a black Suburban parked
behind the trailer The windows are tinted but the two men
up front look very similar to Orestes By the time Daniel
has taken all of these sights in Zimri reaches the top of
the stairs

ZIMRI
May we come in Weve traveled a
very long way to meet with you
Daniel I believe Orestes would
like to use the restroom as well

Daniel Nick and Adam all look at Orestes with raises
eyebrows

ORESTES
I only wish to pee

DANIEL
In that case come on in

Zimri chuckles and steps through the doorway

ORESTES
Why is that funny

Zimri walks into the living room and sits on the couch
Everyone in the house gathers around him

ZIMRI
As we speak hospitals and heath
centers even banks are being
outfitted with machines used to
implant the mark While we dont
know the full purpose of the mark
we do know that it is definitely
going to be more than an implanted
credit card

CUT TO

EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT
There is a long line of people coming out of the front
doors wrapping around the parking lot

CALLISTA (VO)
And you think people will really
accept the mark so easily

ZIMRI (VO)
Of course they will especially in
America When people are scared
they need others to make their
decisions for them

The camera cuts to inside the hospital The camera moves
around and through the massive line of people making its
way to a long hallway with many rooms The line branches
off into smaller lines each leading into a different room
along the hallway The camera flies by the first room only
giving a brief look inside A woman sits in a chair
holding her right hand underneath a machine that resembles a
large high tech microscope A blue laser is shooting out of
where the microscope lens would be onto the womans right
hand

The camera continues to the next room where a man sits ina
chair with his right hand underneath an identical machine
There is another man in the room standing on the other side
of the machine dressed like a doctor

DOCTOR
What color

FOOLISH MAN
Red please

The doctor presses several buttons on the side of the
machine causing it to power up A red laser shoots out of
the machines lens and begins to trace out the symbol of the
mark onto the mans right hand

DANIEL (VO)
What about the angels How do you
explain them Theyre real Weve
all seen them I even spoke to
one

ZIMRI (VO)
They are not angels You have all
been deceived The angels and the
serpents are one in the same They
are not from this planet

The camera pulls back to show the next man in line to
receive the mark Hes sweating profusely and looks
randomly all around him Suddenly he breaks off from the
line and starts to run through the halls towards the exit
The man receives many stares as he bumps into others in
line becoming more frantic to escape
SCARED MAN
(shouting)
This isnt right We shouldnt do
this

The scared man finally makes it out the front door and into
the parking lot There are two police officers standing by
the door helping direct the flow of people The policemen
have a very strange look to them They both have golden
blonde hair that shimmers even in the dark The whites of
their eyes are intensely bright

OFFICER 1
I see you did not get the mark sir
I suggest you go back inside it
really is for your own good

SCARED MAN
I wont Its my right not to

OFFICER 2
If you dont get it then we cannot
protect you

The second officers face quickly turns into a serpents for a
moment then returns to normal The Scared Man shouts in
panic then takes off running down a darkened alley beside
the hospital

The camera cuts to the two officers looking at each other

OFFICER 2 (CONTD)
Is it my turn

OFFICER 1
(grinning)
No mine

The camera cuts back to the Scared Man running down the dark
alley Several shadowy figures lay strewn about the ground
covered in darkness The man looks over his shoulder as he
continues to run He suddenly trips over something in front
of him He falls hard to the ground busting his lip on the
cement He looks down to his feet A dead woman lays
facing him with open eyes A look of fear is frozen on her
face The Scared Man cries out and scrambles across the
ground hiding behind an open dumpster His eyes begin to
adjust and he cries out again in horror as he looks around
There are four other dead bodies he can see laying all
around him Suddenly a bright light flashes near the alley
entrance The light momentarily illuminates the entire
alley There are dozens of dead bodies piled up further
down the alley The Scared Man screams and turns to run
back towards the hospital As he turns he comes face to
face with one of the alien serpents It grabs him by the
throat lifting him off the ground It slams him into the
wall

SCARED MAN
(sputtering)
Plplease

SERPENT
(sounding like Officer 1)
You should have taken the mark

The serpent snaps his neck with one hand then tosses him
into a nearby pile of bodies The serpent turns and
slithers offscreen There is another flash of light The
alley is temporarily illuminated again showing the piles of
dead bodies As the light fades the screen transitions back
to Daniels living room

ZIMRI
Sebastian will soon come to your
country promoting the precious
mark and performing cheap tricks to
amaze and deceive There are those
of their kind that wish to help us
Before the prophets died they told
me of a terrible battle to come
They told me to reach you by any
means necessary To give you their
holy weapons to use in the battle
Not only weapons but the aliens
disguises as well

DANIEL
Why us What can we do

ZIMRI
God has a purpose for all of us
weather we understand it or not

RYAN
God What are you talking about
You said these things are aliens

ZIMRI
Even though these creatures are not
from your planet they are still a
part of Gods plan Otherwise
there would not be those that
wished to help us Or maybe you
would believe it to all be a
coincidence

Zimri turns to Orestes

ZIMRI (CONTD)
Orestes please have the men bring
in the crate There is much to
explain We cannot stay long
though there are many preparations
left before the battle
DANIEL
When is this battle supposed to
take place

ZIMRI
In three days

The camera cuts to out front Zimris men unload the crate
and bring it in through the garage The camera stays
focused on a wide shot of the house as time begins to
elapse As the sun begins to rise time returns to normal
and Zimri and his men get in their vehicles and leave

INT DANIELS BEDROOM - MORNING

Daniel and Callista sit on Daniels bed messing with the
aliens holosuits Daniel looks at a clock on the wall

DANIEL
Damn its 6 in the morning We
should get some sleep

Callista ignores him and puts on the head section of the
suit It fits snugly around her neck and head She
switches it on A beautiful angel face seems to flow out of
the device covering her face Her hair becomes long and
golden flowing down her shoulders

DANIEL (CONTD)
Whoa geez

CALLISTA
(in a haunting angelic
voice)
What Ha-ha Listen to the way my
voice sounds This is crazy So

how do I look

DANIEL
Like an angel
CALLISTA
Smooth I like how you didnt go

for the obvious answer

DANIEL
Yeah well you know how I do

Callista leans close to Daniel
CALLISTA
(playfully)
So tell me have you ever kissed an
angel

DANIEL
Well there was one other time but
we were both really drunk and the
next day at church it was really
awkward and I was like

Callista leans forward and quickly kisses Daniel on the lips
cutting him off As they break apart Daniel looks deep
into the angel eyes and starts to laugh

DANIEL (CONTD)
This is a little strange

Daniel leans in and turns off the suit The angel face
dissolves away

DANIEL (CONTD)
Much better

Daniel puts his hand behind Callistas neck and starts to
kiss her passionately She suddenly tackles him backwards
onto his bed She kisses him up and down the right side of
his neck He closes his eyes and takes in a deep breath
through his nose Callista raises up into a straddling
position and takes off the head portion of the holosuit

She makes a face as if she just had an idea She leans over
the bed and grabs the shoulder and back section of the suit
It fits on similar to a bookbag She switches on the suit
and two large white wings spread out delicately

DANIEL (CONTD)
You look so fuckin hot

CALLISTA
(smiling)
Watch your language

They begin to kiss again The wings move and flex in rhythm
with Callistas body The wings slightly wrap around the
sides of the bed Daniel suddenly wraps his arms around
Callistas waist and rolls putting himself on top of her
He kisses her underneath her chin and down her neck He
lifts his lips barely off her skin and starts to make his
way toward her stomach

CALLISTA (CONTD)
What do you think youre doing

DANIEL
(grinning)
Just kissing

Daniel lifts her shirt up to right underneath her bra He
stares at her flat tan stomach for a moment then begins to
softly kiss and nibble at it Callista giggles slightly
then lets out a hushed moan Daniel kisses his way to the
side of her stomach then works his way down towards her hip
indentions He pauses and looks at Callistas face to see
if she has any objections Her head is tilted back and to
the side and her eyes are closed Daniel takes his pointer
finger and pulls the waistband of Callistas pants down a
couple inches exposing the soft skin of her hips Very
slowly and gently he licks along the indention in her left
hip Callistas ass bucks slightly into the air

CALLISTA
(whispering)
DanielI dont think I can take
much more of that

Daniel ignores her and licks along the other indention on
the right hip The angel wings go stiff as Callista bucks
her hips again As she lowers back to the bed the wings
relax

CALLISTA (CONTD)
What are you trying to do to me
Drive me crazy

DANIEL
Is it working

CALLISTA
(making a pout face)
No

Daniel smiles then looks at Callista seriously

DANIEL
Cal I think Im falling in love
with you I know the timing is

garbage and Im being selfish

Callista grabs Daniel by the shoulders and pulls him top of
her She kisses him strongly on the lips When they break
apart she has tears in her eyes

CALLISTA
I want to be in love with you too
Im just so scared I dont know
whats going to happen I dont
want to lose you

DANIEL
Youre not going to lose me I
promise Youre one of the few
things Im sure about anymore I
really am in love with you

CALLISTA
Even though Im crying and I look
bad

DANIEL
It makes me want you even more
You really havent looked bad one
time since I met you

CALLISTA
Yeah right Im

Daniel kisses her again cutting her off

DANIEL
Lets not talk about that sad stuff
right now

Daniel leans off the bed and grabs a glove-like portion of
the suit He slips it on and looks at Callista

DANIEL (CONTD)
(smiling)
We gotta stay positive if were
gonna save the world

Daniel switches on the suit His hand changes skin tones
and gets slightly larger He stares at his new hand in
disbelief wiggling his fingers

DANIEL (CONTD)
Holy shit

CALLISTA
Be careful with that JZimri told
you what it can do

DANIEL
He said the strength of their
weapons is controlled by emotional
response And here you are trying
to get me all hot and bothered

CALLISTA
Excuse me

DANIEL
Dont worry Im turning you on too

CALLISTA
Im gonna kick your ass

DANIEL
Lets get serious

Callista starts to tickle Daniels ribs

DANIEL (CONTD)
(laughing)
No wait stop Let me take it off
first
Callista ignores him and continues to tickle him

relentlessly Laughing hard Daniel balls up his fist not
thinking His fingers press a button in the middle of the
glove making a clicking noise The blue flames shoot up

from his hand Daniel and
glove

CALLIS1

DANIEL

Daniel opens his hand A small blue fire ball shoots from
the glove and flies into the wall As the ball connects it
explodes taking out a large 5 foot portion of the wall with
it Callista screams followed by Ryan and Sarah who were on

in the bathroom Ryan falls back

into the open toilet and Sarah dives into the running shower

Ryan has his shirt off but is

still wearing jeans and boxers which are now soaked with

What the fuck was that

Daniel bolts off the bed and steps through the new opening

Oh my God are you guys ok I

Daniel looks back and forth between Ryan and Sarah

DANIEL (CONTD)

RYAN

Sarah nods her head which is still buried in her hands As
everyone files out of the room Nick sticks his head back in
the doorway

NICK

Nick laughs and disappears down the hall He catches up
with Daniel

NICK

MATTHEW
I need to know what happened to my
family

MICHAEL
Matthew they are alive Everyone
taken is alive They are ona
ship larger than any ever made
It is called the Blessed Arc

MATTHEW
Why would your people agree to
build a ship for us

MICHAEL
The ship was not built by my
people There are others Their
planet circles a sun in the
constellation Ursa Major They are
the only ones with the wisdom
compassion and resources to
accomplish such a task You will
see your family when this is over
but only if Sebastian can be
defeated

MATTHEW
Why dont you just kill him

MICHAEL
I will act when the time is right
MATTHEW
When the hell is that

MICHAEL
When the Lord whispers in my ear to
strike

Michael walks over to the far wall in the room and waves his
hand over a long panel A compartment opens Michael
reaches in and takes out a holosuit He throws it by Matts
feet

MICHAEL (CONTD)

Put this on I have modified it
allowing me to assist your
movements for a short time If you
are to kill Sebastian you must be
quick He will not have his guard
down for long and the fleet has
almost arrived

MATTHEW
How do you know

MICHAEL
Because we are inside it

The camera cuts to outer space An asteroid around a
fourth of the size of Earths moon barrels past the planet
Saturn

CUT TO

INT DANIELS HOUSE - MORNING

Daniel runs around his house frantically trying to wake up
Callista Ryan Sarah Nick and Adam

DANIEL
Get up theyll be here any minute
Get your shit together Dont

Nancy enters the room wearing a bathrobe looking extremely
concerned

NANCY
Where are you going and why is it

DANIEL
Mom we already talked about this
Theres only six suits People
need to stay and look after the
house Besides Zimri said it

do some little task and his people
will handle the rest Were gonna
be fine I promise

A car horn sounds outside Daniel opens the front door and
sticks his head out There are four black suburbans parked
in the street Orestes sits in the drivers seat of the
lead suburban He rolls down the window and leans out

ORESTES
(shouting to Daniel)
Its time

Daniel looks back inside at everyone running around trying
to get dressed He leans back outside and gives Orestes the
wait finger Orestes does not look pleased

CUT TO

INT TRANSPORT ROOM

Matthew finishes putting on the suit Metallic straps run
across his chest arms legs and back He finises putting
on the head portion of the suit He closes his eyes and
switches it on He slowly and dramatically begins to
change His clothes are replaced with the angelic armor and
his face changes into a handsome angel

The camera cuts to a close-up of the angel face Matts
eyes suddenly open Michael reaches back into the
compartment on the wall and removes an angelic sword He
carefully hands it to Matt

MICHAEL
You will need this

Michael wealds the blade with ease but when he hands it to
Matthew Matt staggers forward and the tips of the blade
falls heavily to the ground Matt looks at Michael with
raised eyebrows

MICHAEL (CONTD)
It takes a little getting used to

Michaels right hand begins to glow He makes a slight
gesture with his hand Matt stands up straight lifting the
blade several inches off the ground The light leaves
Michaels hand and the blade drops back to the floor Matt
has a concerned look on his face

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Like I said before we must make it
quick

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
The four suburbans race down an open stretch of highway

The camera cuts to inside the lead suburban Orestes drives
while Zimri sits in the passenger seat Daniel Callista
Ryan Sarah Nick and Adam sit in the back seats

NICK
(towards Zimri)
Whos that behind us

ZIMRI
They are known as The Guard
Orestes used to command them in
battle many years ago They are
still very loyal

NICK
How many guys is it
ZIMRI
Twenty-five I wish there were

more but believe me they will make
their presence felt

CALLISTA
Where exactly are we going

ZIMRI
Ann Arbor Michigan

DANIEL
(towards Orestes)
So how long until we get there

Orestes turns and gives Daniel the wait finger

DANIEL (CONTD)
(quietly)
Real cute

CUT TO

EXT MICHIGAN STADIUM - DAY

The Michigan Stadium stands enormous seating around
100000 There are two raised platforms and two large TV
screens at one end of the field similar to those at the
Wembley Stadium Outside the stadium there are hundreds of
rows of cars parked with thousands of people filing into the
stadium Almost all of their hands bear the UN Mark The
few people without it look around nervously and receive
harsh stares from the others
The camera cuts to the four black suburbans entering the
parking area People jump out of the way as Orestes whips
the vehicle around the turns looking for a spot to park
Once they find a spot The Guard step out of the other
suburbans looking fierce and ready for battle They all
brandish duffle bags stuffed full of the weapons from the
cargo container Orestes and two other men have additional
longer duffle bags slung over their shoulders Daniel and
his friends all carry the holosuits in bookbags given to
them by Zimri Everyone begins to make their way to the
stadium entrance

DANIEL
(towards Zimri)
Shouldnt there be guards or
military or something

ZIMRI
Sebastian proclaims he has been
resurrected from the dead It
would not seem right to have guards
or show he might fear for his life

ORESTES
Im sure he will have plenty of
protection only we will not be
able to see it until he is in need

Orestes leads the way into the entrance The crowd lines
the entire stadium and two thirds of the field area
Sebastian and Alek stand on their corresponding platforms
Sebastian smiles with his arms outstretched He wears his
sword on his back Alek stands by the wall holding the rope
attached to the velvet curtains He holds out his other
arm smiling like Sebastian Orestes stops in the middle of
the field and stares coldly at the two platforms

ORESTES (CONTD)

Get ready

The Guard begin to push people out of the way forming a
ring around Zimri Orestes Daniel and his friends

ZIMRI
(looking and Daniel and
the others)
You too

Daniel and his friends crouch down and unzip their bookbags
They take out the holosuits and start to put them on
Orestes and two of his men unzip the three larger duffle
bags Orestes looks around at The Guard

ORESTES
Once we launch fire at will

NICK
Launch what
Orestes and the two other men pull out stinger missile
launchers and raise them to their shoulders The
surrounding crowd gasps

CUT TO

TRANSPORT ROOM

Michael walks over to a control panel and presses a button
bringing up a screen that shows an overhead view of the
stadium If the audience looks close enough they can see a
tiny circle in the crowd where The Guard have formed a
ring

MICHAEL
It is time

MATTHEW
But what do I do

MICHAEL
Kill Sebastian I will guide you

MATTHEW
Come with me

MICHAEL
I must stay and reprogram the
fleet Otherwise they will kill
all life on your planet

MATTHEW
Oh

MICHAEL
Remember God has an invisible
host standing near your elbow
ready to intervene on your behalf
Now Go

Michael presses another button on the console Matt raises
several inches off the ground and glows white Seconds
later the light fades and hes gone

CUT TO

OUTDOOR STADIUM

Orestes signals to the two men with rocket launchers then
points at Sebastian He points his own launcher towards
Alek

SEBASTIAN
--behold The creatures Satan has
let loose upon this world
The camera cuts to Alek pulling the rope The curtains
part showing the wall to be bare Elikai and Uriahs
bodies are gone Alek stares in shock at the wall then
turns to look at Sebastian Sebastian has a similar look of
shock but he is staring out into the crowd

The camera cuts to Orestes

ORESTES
This is for Hashan

Callista looks a

Orestes in surprise Orestes and his men
fire their rocke

t launchers

The camera cuts to Alek looking at Sebastian still
surprised Suddenly Sebastian crouches then jumps high
into the air as the rockets connect with the platforms
creating massive explosions and sending debris flying into
the crowd The people in the stadium begin to flee

The camera cuts to Orestes POV

Three exhaust trails lead from the rocket launchers towards
the platforms As the smoke clears Sebastian can be seen
hovering in the air His wings are outstretched and he
holds his sword in his right hand His left fist is balled
up and blue flames are rolling out of it Suddenly dozens
of angels begin to appear with flashes of light surrounding
Sebastian The also have on armor and fire rises up from
their right hands

Several people in the crowd stop to bow while the rest of
the rushing crowd trips over them

Orestes and his men pull out machines guns and open fire
Daniel Callista Ryan Sarah Nick and Adam switch on their
suits Their bodies dramatically transform into angels
clad in armor Sebastians angels continue appearing until
they number around 70 While The Guard continues to fire
the angels begin to rain down fireballs at them Everyone
in the circle breaks off into smaller groups As The Guards
spray a nearby angel with bullets His body twitches in
midair then reverts back to a serpent as it collapses on the
ground Seven members of The Guard get hit in the chest and
face with the blue fireballs They fly back several feet
through the air Their bodies land hard on the ground
bloody and on fire Daniel and his friends split off into
groups of two He and Callista Ryan and Sarah and Nick
and Adam Sebastians angels continue to rain down
fireballs into the crowd Many innocent people are killed
trying to flee Daniel and his friends return fire
catching several angels off guard

Sebastian lands on the ground at the back of the field and
begins to walk casually forward with the same malicious
smile on his face His sword begins to intensify with blue
light

The camera cuts to near the entrance to the stadium There
is a bright flash of light Matt appears wearing his
angelic armor and holding the warrior blade He stares out
on the exchange of bullets and fire Matts blade also
begins to intensify with blue light He takes off running
toward the fighting He half carries half drags the sword
along with him but never slows in pace

The camera cuts back to The Guard and Daniel and his friends
being pushed back by the advancing angels Nick and Adam
are pinned down but putting up a good fight Adam fires a
large flame ball that explodes into the face of an oncoming
angel Its headless body falls smoking to the ground

Ryan and Sarah are also pinned down but doing more dodging
than firing Between the two groups are Daniel and
Callista The Guard Zimri and Orestes are peppered
throughout the line

The camera cuts back to Matt charging towards the line As
he gets closer the sword begins to intensify in color but
also weighs down more dragging and cutting into the ground
Matt breaks through the line of his friends and continues
towards the main concentration of angels JZimri Orestes
and several others stare in amazement

CUT TO

TRANSPORT ROOM

Michael watches the fighting on the console screen He
closes his eyes and holds up his glowing hands towards the
screen He mutters incoherently to himself

CUT TO

OUTDOOR STADIUM

As Matt gets closer to Sebastian several angels leap at him
with their arms outstretched ready to crush his bones

Matt groans and strains as he swings the heavy sword out in
front of him throwing dirt through the air A seven foot
long blue energy wave shoots out from the blade The wave
slices through the legs of the closest angel the chest of
an angel to the left and decapitating an angel further back
to the left of him As the wave slices through their
bodies the holosuits shut down reverting the falling
pieces into their serpent like form Matt crouches and
leaps over another small group of angels As he takes a
second higher leap dozens of angels jump at the same time
30 or so angels hang in the air like a flock of menacing
birds Matt slings the sword horizontally a long energy
wave begins to spread out through the air

The camera cuts to a shot of the ground underneath Matt He
lands on the ground taking a knee Serpent body parts begin
to rain down in front of him Matt notices the sword
beginning to feel lighter He stares into the mass of
remaining angels The slightest grin forms on his face

The camera cuts to Daniel

DANIEL
Come on

Daniel and his friends and The Guard begin to push forward
sending out blue fireballs and spraying bullets As an
angel reaches for Zimri Orestes grabs it by the arms tugs
as hard as he can dislocating them from their sockets He
drops the limp arms and grabs it by its head twisting it
violently to the side

The camera cuts to Matthew swinging wildly into the crowd of
angels Shock waves tear through the serpents and rip up
the surrounding stadium

Sebastian finally starts to run then leaps landing close to
The Guard He throws out a large blue energy ball into a
group of four men that explodes sending their dead bodies
flying through the air He slings his blade cutting two
more of The Guard along with several fleeing people in half
Sebastian turns towards Nick and Adam and sends out another
energy ball Adam jumps in front of Nick and tries to send
out his own energy ball to intercept it The energy shots
connect but too close and the resulting explosion that sends
Adam flying backwards into the stadium seats and knocks Nick
and many other nearby humans to the ground

Callista Daniel Ryan and Sarah fire out energy blasts at
Sebastian They miss but Sebastian jumps back into a
thicket of people allowing Nick some time to get to his
brother Matt continues to dodging fireballs and slicing
his way closer to Sebastian

Nick kneels over his brother holding his head in his lap
and weeping bitterly After a moment he collects himself
He leans over Adam and removes the energy glove from his

hand He places it on his own left hand and turns towards
the approaching angels with Sebastian in the center Nick
balls both his hands into tight fists and begins to charge

the gloves The flames shoot up to the normal size but
continue to grow becoming massive Nicks arms are both
completely engulfed in the blue flames He raises his arms

and puts his fists together aiming them right into the
crowd of angels He screams in rage

The camera cuts to Matt As he nears Sebastian everything
in his line of vision lights up a fiery blue then a
deafening explosion goes off sending dozens of the serpents
bodies sailing through the air As Matts disorientation
wears off he notices Sebastian lying in the midst of many
dead aliens Their bodies have certain parts looking angelic
and others like a serpent Bruised and bloody with a broken

arm Sebastian picks up his sword with his other hand and
turns preparing to fire a shockwave at Nick

Matt raises his sword high over his head then brings it
crashing down into the ground A think precise vertical
wave rockets across the ground tearing through a few angels
then slicing through Sebastians arm holding the sword and
the tip of his slithering tail He screams out in shock and
pain He falls to the ground bleeding and looking up into
the sky As he stares he suddenly begins to laugh He
raises his broken hand to the sky and says something in his
alien language

The camera cuts to Matt looking up at the sky He notices
the constant meteor shower is gone Suddenly what looks
like the tip of a mountain breaks through the thick clouds
Its around the size of the entire stadium

The camera cuts to a panoramic view of the sky

What looks like an entire upsidedown mountain emerges
through the clouds Everyone in the stadium looks to the
sky The humans gasp

DANIEL (CONTD)
What

Matt looks back at Sebastian and hurriedly sends out another
shockwave to finish him off Right before the shockwave
reaches Sebastian a massive cylinder of light fires from
the mountain shooting towards Sebastian and slamming into
the ground around him His body floats a foot off the
ground then glows white Seconds later he disappears along
with the light beam

MATTHEW
No Goddamn you Michael why

Right then a massive explosion goes off behind Matt
knocking him to the ground Matt rolls on his side to see a
large pile of dead alien bodies with Nick laying in the
middle A single alien in the pile stirs He looks up and
makes eye contact with Matt It raises a flame glove and
fires out a single energy ball before collapsing

The camera follows the ball as it speeds along the ground
toward Matt At the last second he raises his sword out in
front of him The sword glows brightly as the ball slams
into it The sword absorbs the majority of the blast but a
small explosion results knocking the sword from Matts
hand and throwing his body across the ground and sliding to
a stop The angel face and part of the chest and left leg
armor dissolve away revealing Matts bloody face and chest
The wings twitch slightly

CUT TO
TRANSPORT ROOM

Sebastian lays on the transport pad in a pool of his own
blood His face is still that of an angel but the majority
of his body has reverted back to a serpents He looks
around in a daze Michael stands over him

MICHAEL
Let me help you

Sebastian has a grateful look on his face and lets Michael
help him up He slithers awkwardly over to the view screen
observing the stadium on Earth He presses a button

SEBASTIAN
(shouting loudly)
Kill them all

VIEW SCREEN

The remaining aliens advance on the remaining humans The
camera moves through the screen and transitions into an
overhead view of the real battle The camera zooms to Matt
laying on his back Two sets of hands grab him by the
shoulders followed by two more Daniel Callista Ryan and
Sarah drag Matt away from the angels toward the stadium
entrance

DANIEL
Oh my God Matt

Daniel and Callistas eyes water as they try to shake Matt
awake He doesnt seem to be responding

The camera cuts to a bloody Orestes with Zimri slung over
his shoulder unconscious He is closer to the entrance
than the others and continues out to the parking lot

CUT TO

TRANSPORT ROOM

Michael stands behind Sebastian looking at the back of his
angelic head

SEBASTIAN
Soon this world will be mine I
will be king For your loyalty you
will be made prince of the Earth
Your riches will know no bounds

The camera cuts to Michaels solemn face

MICHAEL
I serve the King Most High
Michael draws a sword from his back He takes a ste
forward Sebastian nods slightly thinking Michael is
referring to him

MICHAEL (CONTD)
The riches of Earth will turn to
dustand Whosoever shall exalt
himself will be abased and he that
humbles himself shall be exalted

Looking puzzled Sebastian turns towards Michael His eyes
widen

The camera cuts to Michael He looks very ominous and holy
Its as if he even has a divine aura around him The sword
glows vibrantly in his hands

SEBASTIAN
What are you doing

MICHAEL
No one can serve two masters

Michael swings the sword chopping Sebastians head off As
the head falls it turns back into the serpent form

Michael sets down the sword and steps over Sebastians body
looking at the viewscreen

CUT TO

OUTDOOR STADIUM

Daniel and Ryan continue dragging Matthew away from the
fighting Callista and Sarah try to give them cover fire
while avoiding attacks themselves

The camera cuts back to a view of the sky The mountainous
asteroid blocks out the sun as it slowly moves closer The
battlefield seems to turn from day to night Deep cracks
and fissures begin to tear through the asteroid All the
remaining angels stop fighting and look up to the sky
Lightning shoots through the clouds and the rock The
angels all glow white and disappear There is a total
silence Suddenly the asteroid surface begins to shake
violently even the air seems to vibrate The humans to
fall to the ground Matt finally wakes up staring up at the
asteroid

MATTS POV - THE ASTEROID

A deafening explosion sounds The outer surface of the
mountain shatters into millions of rocky chunks The pieces
stay suspended in midair around the concealed alien fleet
Hundreds of thousands of small ships begin to file out from
inside the broken up mountain of rock The design of the
ships resembles a locust From below it seems as if a
massive black river is flowing out through the air

The camera cuts to an overheard view of the fleet

The sun strikes
the top making i

the shiny metallic surface of the ships from
t look like a river of light

The camera cuts back to the ground As the ships continue
to pour out and spread out all the rocky chunks that made
up the asteroid shell begin to fall to the ground The
center of the asteroid is an enormous ship Enough of the
smaller black ships surrounding it are gone showing it to
be red and having two winglike structure coming out the
sides The ship resembles a dragon

The camera cuts to Matthew and his friends huddled together
They will not be able to make it out of the stadium before
being crushed to death by the falling rock

Moments before the falling chunks smash their bodies
another white cylinder of light fires from the front of the
red ship It seems to tear through the air as it makes its
way to Matt and his friends The beam is around 8 feet in
diameter It slams into the ground around them encasing
them Their bodies float several feet off the ground then
disappear The clothes they had on underneath the holosuits
fall to the ground as the beam disappears

The camera cuts to the sea of ships spreading out across the
horizon

CUT TO

TRANSPORT ROOM

Matthew lays on the transport pad in a pool of Sebastians
blood Matt is conscious but very disoriented Matts body
still appears as an angel but his face is his own He can
see a blurry outline of an angel in front of him He picks
up the bloody sword laid down by Michael and swings it ina
wide arc at his head Michael easily catches his arm Matt
spits blood onto the side of his face Michael turns his
other cheek toward Matt

MATTHEW
We didnt do anything We didnt
know

MICHAEL

The sins of the father shall be
visited upon the sons to the third
and fourth generation

At the sounds of Michaels voice Matts vision comes into
focus
MATTHEW
Michael Where are they

MICHAEL
Theyre fine
MATTHEW
So leave now Return the people
you took
MICHAEL
No that is not Gods plan
MATTHEW
God doesnt want this
MICHAEL
Do no pretend you know the will of
God
MATTHEW

And you do

MICHAEL
I have bathed in his presence and
love He has spoken to my soul and
acts through me to accomplish his
will

MATTHEW
I dont understand Whats the
fucking plan then What was the
point of the Mark

MICHAEL

Sebastian used your religion to get
your people to accept the Mark It
would serve as a means to track
your people once the fleet arrived
After the cities were destroyed it
would take no time at all to
activate the Marks and locate the
survivors

Michael pauses then begins to smile softly

MICHAEL (CONTD)
There is a new world that has been
prepared for you The world of
those that build the Blessed Arc
They have learned to live in
harmony with their planet They
have agreed to show you the way
We will stay here and fix the
damage you have done to your
planet Those not on the arc will
stay and help
MATTHEW
As slaves

MICHAEL
You are already slaves to
yourselves One day when you
people are ready they can return
and try to take back the Earth

MATTHEW
What do you mean try

MICHAEL
You have lost the right to live
here Through the grace of God you
have been given a second chance
But you must earn the right to
reclaim Earth You must fight for
it Maybe then you can truly
appreciate it

CUT TO

OUTER SPACE

There is a gigantic beautiful ship resembling a cruise ship
made of glass Stars and planets can be seen reflected off
the glass-like sides of the ship Millions of Humans in
white robes can be seen through the sides looking out in
amazement

The camera cuts to a wide shot of the Earth The remains of
the giant asteroid can be seen breaking up as thick black
lines of ships spread throughout the Earths atmosphere

SERIES OF SHOTS

The ships spreading out and positioning over cities and
superhighways all over the world

People standing outside their cars and homes staring up
into the sky

Nancy sitting by a window in her house holding Timothy in
her arms crying

CUT TO

TRANSPORT ROOM

MATTHEW
You dont have to do this Its
our fucking planet not yours
MICHAEL
You are all the children of God
You have grown too far from your
Father Your people are drowning
in sin Drugs sex and violence
have become your holy trinity You
have appointed yourselves your own
creators answering to no one You
worry only for yourselves while
disease starvation and senseless
death are ignored

The camera cuts to a closeup on one the small black ships
Two panels open up on the sides and two cannon like pieces
extend

MICHAEL (VO) (CONTD)
It is ironic that when faced with
impending death even an atheist
will call on God for help Know
your Father in the beginning not
the end

CUT TO

THE INVASION FLEET
The ships cannons glow blue then open fire

MICHAEL (VO)
Do you see these great buildings
Not one stone will be left upon
another that will not be thrown
down

SERIES OF SHOTS

Sky scrapers fall

Highways are ripped into pieces

Moments crumble to the ground

All the natural environment is left unharmed

The camera cuts to the stream of fighters closing in on
Daniels house Nancy clutches Timothy Her eyes are closed
and tears run down her face The camera cuts to a view of
the ships firing Seconds before the blasts hits the house
a white column of light fires from the red ship through the

roof of Daniels house As the light fades the house is
blown to pieces

CUT TO
TRANSPORT ROOM

Michael stands looking at the remains of Daniels house of
the viewscreen He turns to Matthew

MATTHEW
Thank youMichael

Matthew stares at the walls silently trying to process
everything he has heard He turns towards Michael and looks
at him curiously

MATTHEW

Take off your suit I want to see
the real you

Michael smiles and takes a step closer to Matt
MICHAEL
Cast away your worries and doubts

Trust in God and let forever be

Michael puts a glowing white hand to Matts forehead

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Amen

Matthews eyes roll back in his head He begins to collapse
to the ground Right before he hits the ground his body
freezes in air a few inches off the floor He body glows
white then disappears Still smiling Michael turns back to
the viewscreen He presses several buttons on the console
causing an image of the UN Mark to come up on the screen

He places his right hand over the symbol on the screen The
symbols lights up brightly

CUT TO

OUTDOOR STADIUM

Orestes and Zimri along with thousands of people travel
away from the demolished stadium The roads are destroyed
so they walk along the dirt path next to the chunks of
overturned cement Suddenly people begin to cry out as the
Mark on their hand begins to glow brightly The Mark begins
to project a holographic image of itself inches above the
peoples hands The three rings and three lines begin to
rearrange themselves turning the symbol into something
closely resembling the numbers 666 Zimri cries out
removing his glove and staring in horror at his hand In
the distance more alien ships can be seen entering the
atmosphere and landing Zimri holds his hand out towards
Orestes

ZIMRI
You know what to do

Orestes nods and removes a very large blade from his boot
He grips Zimri by the wrist with one hand and raises the
knife high in the air with his other hand

CUT TO

INT BLESSED ARC

Matt wakes up on his back looking up His eyes begin to
dart all around The camera pans back to reveal hundreds of
people standing around him There are many childrens faces
from many different races smiling at him Everyone is
dressed in white robes They help Matt to his feet He
takes a moment to look around The inside of the ship is
awe inspiring It seems to go on forever in every
direction Everywhere intricate glass like artwork can be
seen There are literally millions of people as far as Matt
can see

DANIEL (0S)
Its like another world in here

Matt turns to see Daniel He looks very happy Matt looks
over Daniels shoulder He can see Nancy Timothy Callista
and Daniels father approaching

DEBORAH (05S)
Matty

Matt is suddenly tackled from behind He looks over his
shoulder to see his mom and sister Standing behind them is
Matts father Tears of joy are pouring out of both
familiess eyes

CUT TO

EXT OUTDOOR STADIUM

The dragon like ship hovers above the destroyed stadium
Michael stands down below looking out on a massive army of
the serpent-like aliens Giant ships enter the atmosphere
and land to the right and left of the army unloading even
more aliens In the distance the serpents can be seen
rounding up and detaining the fleeing humans Overhead a
massive fleet of ships resembling oil tankers fly by As
they fly over the remains of destroyed highways and building
they spray out a chemical that looks like regular rainwater
It coats the broken up cement and metal

CLOSEUP - HIGHWAY REMAINS
The cement and steel and other makings of the highway begin
to dissolve They continue until it reaches the bare earth
The chemicals then soak into the soil and turn it to a rich
earthy color

The camera cuts to Michael As he looks out smiling he
presses a button in the center of his holosuit Before the
suit can melt away Michael begins to glow an intense white
so by the time the suit dissolves away only a white
silhouette can be seen Michael does not disappear but
instead stands where he is The white silhouette walks
towards the screen The camera zooms on his face Lines
resembling facial features can be seen

FADE TO

EXT BLESSED ARC

The Blessed Arc drifts through the depths of space In the
distance there is a beautiful planet full of color and much
larger than Earth The camera zooms on the side of the Arc
and onto the face of Matthew and his family and friends
looking out

MATTHEW (VO)
You know its true what they
sayyou dont know what youve
got until its gone I never
thought I could say that about my
fucking planet Maybe Michael was
right all along Maybe we had
taken everything for granted Wed
become so focused on ourselves that
the rest of the universe had become
one big blur One day things came
into focus and we tried to look up
but it was too late judgement was
already here Daniel says we tried
to used things like drugs sex and
material possessions to fill the
void left by our rejection of God
Had God finally rejected us As I
stare out into the infinite depths
of space my heart warms slightly
Maybe this Arc is Gods proof of
continued mercy We were sent away
to start over and we will
Michael told me if we wanted Earth
back wed have to fight for it
and well do that too Theres no
doubt about that I only hope that
when that battle takes place those
bastards can grasp the full force
of the human spirit and appreciate
itI dont know what the future
holds but I know who holds it

FADE OUT

THE END
