The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction
for war is a drug - Chris Hedges

The loud BUZZ of an electric engine and the CRUNCHING of
wheels traversing rough terrain Then SIRENS HORNS SHOUTS

As the din intensifies the quote recedes

FADE IN

EXT BAGHDAD STREET DAWN - ROBOT CAM POV

A grainy low-resolution view of a dusty dirt road Were
low just inches off the sun-washed ground and moving fast

ZOOMING down a street littered with the refuse of war spent
munitions rubber bits animal waste -- all of which from
this odd jarring perspective looks gigantic monstrous

We approach a crumpled COKE CAN the white ‘C’ growing
enormous on the screen filling the screen like a skyscraper
SMASH into the can and barrel ahead

A RAG flutters blocks our view then flies away as we pop

over a bump catching air and a flash of the horizon line

BRIGHT SUN then landing hard and continue zipping down the
dusty road

CUT TO

EXT BAGHDAD STREET - DAWN

A rushed disorderly evacuation Iraqi POLICE and SOLDIERS
herd civilians away from some unseen danger

INTERCUT

A remote controlled TALON ROBOT (about a quarter million
dollars of military-grade bomb squad electronics aka ‘the
bot’) whose SMALL VIDEO CAMERA we have been watching drives
down the side of the road on a pair of treads
Across the street an Iraqi BUTCHER wearing a bloody white
smock resists being moved from his outdoor stand which
consists of little more than goat carcasses hung on metal
hooks

From all sides American military arrive in armored TROOP
CARRIERS disgorging teams of US ARMY INFANTRY SOLDIERS who
shout “secure the area’ ‘watch your six’ ‘stop traffic’
etc

TITLE

BAGHDAD 2004

This is all taking place in a densely populated very noisy
section of Baghdad the SOUND of far off GUNSHOTS and CALL to

prayer magnify the turmoil of a metropolis in the midst of an
occupationinsurgencycivil war

EXT STREET DAWN

The BUTCHER furious with the way he’s being pushed around
is forcibly removed from his shop by several IRAQI SOLDIERS
EXT STREET DAWN - ROBOT CAM POV

Via the low-angle video camera we glimpse a herd of GOATS
scampering through frame BURKA-clad WOMEN and OLD MEN in
traditional garb flee the scene

Several more US INFANTRY SOLDIERS move a few straggler
PEDESTRIANS away from a trash pile and the TALON ROBOT

View momentarily blocked by STATIC INTERFERENCE

But when the screen clears we close in on one particular
TRASH PILE topped with a white plastic garbage bag

Whatever it is that has everyone so afraid lies inside this
bag

EXT MIDDLE EASTERN STREET - DAWN

The TALON ROBOT pokes around the bag and the trash pile with
its mechanical VISE GRIP
UPRANGE

Next to a parked Humvee THREE EOD (Explosive Ordnance
Disposal aka Bomb Squad) SOLDIERS crouch over a laptop
computer screen showing an image of the TRASH PILE

Working the joystick on the laptop is SERGEANT J T SANBORN
a type-A jock high school football star cocky outgoing
ready with a smile and quick with a joke or if you
prefer a jab to the chin Think Muhammad Ali with a rifle

SANBORN
I think we have touchdown
DOWNRANGE

The robot grinds the dirt edging closer to the bag

UPRANGE

Standing near Sanborn SERGEANT FIRST CLASS MATT THOMPSON
wipes the sweat on his brow Although he’s the team leader
every inch the professional soldier working a routine
mission Thompson’s normally rock-solid nerves are wavering
in the punishing desert heat

While nibbling on a SNICKERS candy bar Thompson glances over
his shoulder noting potential threats a WOMAN in a VEIL and
then TWO MALES in a window - all of whom are watching him
with inscrutable expressions

Thompson turns back to Sanborn and the task at hand

LAPTOP SCREEN
We glide across the pile Flies buzzing
Puffs of dust and fluttering plastic

Advancing slowly inch by inch to the edge for our first
glimpse inside the bag

A RUSTY ARTILLERY SHELL WITH A WIRE PROTRUDING FROM THE NOSE
CONE
UPRANGE

SANBORN
Hello mamma

Zoom in on the nose cone of the shell

THOMPSON
(re the robot’s camera)
Push it in

SANBORN
I can’t

THOMPSON
What do you mean - you can’t
Pretend it’s your dick

SANBORN
How about I pretend it’s your dick

THOMPSON
Youll never get it in if you do
that Let me try

A THIRD SOLDIER clearly enjoying the two men he’s with
leans in for a better look This is SPECIALIST OWEN ELDRIDGE
the youngest of the group impressionable vulnerable yet
quite capable of showing surprising backbone

SANBORN
Give me a second

THOMPSON
No Time is up My dick

They change places Thompson now on the controls They can
see protruding from the rusty shell the tell-tale wire of an
Improvised Explosive Device (IED)

THOMPSON
See that

SANBORN
Nice one-five-five

THOMPSON
Yeah That’s going to do some
damage
SANBORN
(calling over his
shoulder)
Hey Eldridge we’re going to need a
charge

Eldridge is already on it approaching with the four blocks
of C4 plastic explosive He’s done this enough to know what
they need

ELDRIDGE
Got it Figured four blocks gives
you about twenty pounds of bang
total Are we going to be far
enough away

Thompson takes stock of the situation We see the IED in the
distance -- far far away

THOMPSON
The blast is going to roll out
there (pointing) the shell will
probably kick out there (pointing)
and most of the shrapnel is going
to rain up in a beautiful umbrella
pattern Some smaller pieces and
shell fragments will come out this
way but we’ll be okay if we are
behind the Humvee Bring the bot
back and we will load up

SANBORN
No problem Bot is moving

CUT TO

DOWNRANGE NEAR PLASTIC BAG

The bot dutifully makes its return voyage back to the men

ACROSS THE STREET

A crowd of angry pedestrians is being held in place by a few
Iraqi soldiers but when one soldier turns aside to help an
old man the cantankerous BUTCHER slips past and dashes back
to his store
UPRANGE

Eldridge clips a make-shift wagon to a hitch on the rear of
the robot Inside the wagon he’s placed an array of C4
Sanborn asks “ready” Eldridge replies “good to go”

SANBORN
Alright Wagon is set Bot moves
The bot returns downrange towing the cart and a coil of

unspooling detonation wire which Eldridge is holding

When

the HERD of GOATS from earlier circles back and momentarily
impedes the robot

SANBORN
(laughing)
Goats Blow those bastards up

DOWNRANGE

The robot churns down the now empty street

UPRANGE

Thompson scans his surroundings finds a third IRAQI MALE
watching him from a nearby balcony

A flicker of concern flashes across his face

DOWNRANGE
The robot hits a bump and a rock jams in the wagon’s wheel

and breaks the lock nut popping the wheel and causing the
whole rig to grind to a halt

UPRANGE

Everyone cringes

DOWNRANGE

The wagon is stranded
UPRANGE
Sanborn wiggles the stick It’s not happening

SANBORN
Wagon is having a bad day

THOMPSON
(to Eldridge)
Did you build that

ELDRIDGE
No the US Army did

THOMPSON
It looks like I’m going down there

SANBORN
What you don’t like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood

Thompson ruefully tosses his helmet into the truck

THOMPSON
I love it

CUT TO

EXT HUMVEE MOMENTS LATER

Sanborn unpacks “THE SUIT” A state-of-the-art contraption
that looks like an astronaut suit and helmet crossed with the
Michelin Man Because of its weight and complexity it takes
two men to put it on - or one Sanborn

Sanborn kneels down and guides Thompson’s feet into the
suit’s black boots then lashes up a series of Velcro straps
to secure the armor like a squire working on a knight

Thompson twists to get his chest protector on Eyes tight
brow furrowed squints into the far distance Thats going
to be a mean motherfucker

THOMPSON
Okay I’m going to make my
approach This area looks okay No
power-lines Clean line of sight
If it looks alright when I get down
there I’m going to plug it in and
well just BIP it

(MORE)
THOMPSON (contd)
I want them to know if they’re
going to leave a bomb on the side
of the road we’re going to blow up
their little fucking road

SANBORN
Ready

THOMPSON
I’m craving a hamburger is that
strange

SANBORN

Not for you

Sanborn seals Thompson’s helmet with a glass plate while
Eldridge attaches a breathing hose

THOMPSON
(headset from inside the
helmet )
This is Blaster One

SANBORN
(into walkie)
Roger that Blaster One You’re
good to go

Thompson begins the lonely walk toward the bomb
Sanborn checks on the TWO IRAQI males in the balcony by
glassing them with his M4 scope

An excited blustering YOUNG IRAQI MALE having just exited a
nearby building approaches Sanborn with his hand extended in
greeting

YOUNG MAN

Sanborn shakes his head raises his rifle
The young man maintains a nervous grin

SANBORN
No

YOUNG MAN
California New York

Now they are standing close to each other

SANBORN
Get out of here man

YOUNG MAN
Where

SANBORN

This ain’t a fucking meet-and-
greet GET OUT OF HERE

Sanborn shoves the young man in the chest hard enough to
nearly knock him over

SANBORN
GO

The man skulks away offended and confused
Eldridge -- who is about thirty feet away and inspecting a
burned out car -- notices this interaction out of the corner

of his eye and keys his walkie to Sanborn

ELDRIDGE
Making friends again Sanborn

SANBORN
(smiling)
All day long

DOWNRANGE
Thompson walks on

The desert sun glints off a nearby car and momentarily
bleaches his mask bright white

A YOUNG GIRL with an INFANT BABY in her arms appears in a far
off doorway then withdraws out of sight

Eldridge and Sanborn are at the ready scanning the area and
watching Thompson

Good to go coming back

Thompson gets up looks around at the empty road under heavy
guard

The war has stopped for him and he knows it

Thompson begins to walk back uprange looking carefully at
the ground around him

THOMPSON

UPRANGE

Sanborn and Eldridge lower their rifles

DOWNRANGE NEAR PLASTIC BAG

Thompson carefully nudges a Coke can out of the way of his
boots

UPRANGE

Eldridge killing time turns to Sanborn as they both watch
Thompson

ELDRIDGE
Hey Sanborn you know what this
place needs

Looking around the war torn dirt street the mud colored
buildings and endless expanse of dust and sand Nothing but
brown on brown

SANBORN
I’m listening
ELDRIDGE
Grass
SANBORN
We gonna start our grass business
ELDRIDGE
That’s right I’m going to sell the
grass -- and you’re going to cut

Eldridge squints into the sun

Out of the corner of his eye he sees movement in the butcher
shop and raises his carbine

SCOPE POV

The BUTCHER is holding a cell phone

UPRANGE

ELDRIDGE
Hey Sanborn -- Butcher shop - two
oclock Dude has a phone

SANBORN
Make him put it down --

Eldridge runs toward the butcher shop

Sanborn raises his scope but Eldridge is blocking his line
fire and he can’t get a shot

ELDRIDGE
(shouting waving his gun)
Hey - put that down--

The BUTCHER nods and puts up his hand as if to say ‘give me

a minute’

DOWNRANGE
Thompson senses trouble
THOMPSON
(headset)
Why is Eldridge running Come on
guys talk to me
UPRANGE

Eldridge runs hard

ELDRIDGE
Drop the phone

Sanborn bolts sideways trying to maneuver around Eldridge

Thompson running full out now when

BOOM --

-- A giant billowing fireball bursts from the bomb
-- flattening Thompson

-- blood splatters the inside of his helmet Then
-- a secondary explosion erupts

-- spewing dust and a wave of particulate matter

-- enveloping Eldridge and Sanborn in a coarse cloud of
debris

-- we stay on the blast’s aftermath as the last dust roils
out in slow motion and

-- floats silently over Thompson’s slain body

INT CAMP VICTORY WAREHOUSE MORTUARY AFFAIRS - DAY

An officious young MORTUARY AFFAIRS SOLDIER opens the wooden
lid of a very white large box

Inside wrapped in plastic are the remains of a soldier’s
life a pair of boots a toothbrush a comb an American
flag

Sanborn stares Struggling to find meaning in the objects
Now we see that he’s standing in a large warehouse the
mortuary affairs office which is filled with rows and rows

of many other identical white boxes

MORTUARY SOLDIER
Anywhere is good

Sanborn gently places Thompson’s dog tags in the box

SOLDIER
Is that everything

SANBORN
Yeah

The white box closes Latches secure the lid
And that’s that The soldier walks away

Sanborn grips the box He does not let go

EXT CAMP VICTORY DAY

Sanborn trudges across a camp clearing which is bounded by
the barracks and rows of identical aluminum trailers

INT TRAILER

Inside a darkened standard-issue military trailer Ministry is
BLASTING rattling the walls

Sanborn knocks on the door hears “yeah it’s open come in”
and steps inside

He’s greeted by a MAN holding a roofing hammer in one hand
and a cigarette in the other This is SERGEANT FIRST CLASS
WILLIAM JAMES his new boss

Sanborn extends his hand and they shake

SANBORN
Sergeant James JT Sanborn my
man

JAMES

Call me Will

SANBORN
Welcome to Bravo Company and
welcome to Camp Victory

JAMES
Camp Victory I thought this was
Camp Liberty

SANBORN
No they changed the name about a
week ago ‘Victory’ sounds better

An awkward silence ensues allowing us to get a better look at
James Though a former US Army Ranger in his early
thirties fit and good-looking one of the lucky ones he
possesses an unusual demeanor In a world of outgoing young
men James seems markedly self-absorbed Sanborn notices this
trait instantly and is puzzled by it The truth is that after
so many years down range racking up kills and disarming
bombs James has lost some of the ability and most of the
need to connect to other people

Right now however James is doing his best to act like a
regular nice guy

JAMES
Alright Well I guess I’m in the
right place
(Beat)
As long as you are here could you
give me a hand with this

James jerks his head to a window covered with a board of
plywood He walks over to it and starts removing the wood
motioning for Sanborn to grab one end of the board

SANBORN
Maybe you shouldn’t take this down
We get a lot of mortars at night
here The plywood helps stop the
lateral frag from coming through
That’s why it’s up there

JAMES
It’s not going to stop a mortar
from coming through the roof -- you

know Besides I like the
sunshine (awkwardly) I’m sorry
about Thompson I heard he was a
good tech

SANBORN
Yeah he was and he was a great
team leader too

JAMES
I’m not trying to fill his shoes
I’m just going to do my best

SANBORN
Appreciate it

Although Sanborn is almost warming to his new Sergeant James
has reached his intimacy limit

He cranks the music grabs his still-burning cigarette and
flops down on the bed -- all in one surprisingly fluid
motion

Then announces cheerfully

JAMES
Home sweet home

CUT TO

INT HUMVEE CAMP VICTORY

Sanborn is behind the wheel James is in the passenger seat
Eldridge is in the back seat

Looking through the Humvee window we drive past a long line
of Ml Abrams battle tanks They’re neatly parked and
gathering sand on all horizontal surfaces

ELDRIDGE
Aren’t you glad the Army has all
these tanks parked here just in
case the Russians come and we have
to have a big tank battle

SANBORN
Id rather be on the side with the
tanks just in case

ELDRIDGE
But they don’t do anything here
Anybody comes alongside the Humvee
were dead Anybody even looks at
you funny we’re dead Pretty much
the bottom line is if youre in
Iraq you’re dead How’s a fucking
tank supposed to stop that

SANBORN
Shut the fuck up Owen

ELDRIDGE
(smiling)
Sorry Just trying to scare the
new guy
James shrugs this off

The Humvee edges close to a cluster of cars Eldridge moves
up to the gunner’s seat on top of the Humvee

EXT HUMVEE

Eldridge has a collection of half-empty water bottles that he
keeps in the gunner’s nest

He throws a water bottle at the car in front of him
It smashes into the car’s rear windshield

A passenger inside spins enraged He sees the Humvee
Settles for a one finger salute for the American

ELDRIDGE

EXT BAGHDAD STREET EARLY MORNING

The Humvee grinds to a stop in a ghetto overflowing with
trash with more mud dwellings that look as beaten down as
the people

James is first out lighting another cigarette

Sanborn comes up behind him Eldridge climbs out of the
turret

They are now completely out in the open feet on Iraqi
ground where anything can happen

Eldridge begins turning suspicious bits of plastic over with
the tip of his boots

JAMES
(looking around at the
empty street)
Where are the guys who called this
in

James walks on down the street

Sanborn and Eldridge exchange a glance ‘what the hell’ and
follow him

Meanwhile in the background Iraqi civilians go about their
daily life

James Sanborn and Eldridge continue their slow walk down the
street

Around a corner an empty Humvee comes into view

JAMES
We got a Humvee

On the other side of the street Sanborn rounds the corner
approaching the Humvee He shouts in case someone is inside

SANBORN
Friendly

But there is nobody to hear him The truck is empty
Eldridge looks inside the vehicle checking for blood

James sees a tiny American flag being waved in the window of
a nearby building and heads over to it

ELDRIDGE
(scared)
They abandoned their vehicle

SANBORN
(scared too)
We got an empty Humvee over here

JAMES
Got it

EXTINT BAGHDAD BUILDING DAY

James peers into a garden where a half dozen young SOLDIERS
are resting and trying not to look afraid and one SERGEANT
CARTER is trying not to look embarrassed

JAMES
Morning boys Don’t tell me the
bomb is in there with you

SERGEANT CARTER
Let’s step outside I’11l show you
what’s going on

He moves into the open and points down the block

SERGEANT CARTER
Down the block about 20 meters
this side of the mosque East side
of the street one of our
informants saw wires in a rubble
pile - possible IED I trust this
guy I know him You want to talk

to him

JAMES
I’1l handle it Keep your guys
back

(to Eldridge)

JAMES
Break out the suit

SANBORN
What about the bot

JAMES
I’1ll take care of it

SANBORN
What Don’t you want us to get the
bot down there to see what it looks
like

JAMES
I’1l handle it

SANBORN
It’s kind of tight down here
James

James grins Sanborn shoots Eldridge a look Is he a new guy
or what

EXT HUMVEE MOMENTS LATER

Sanborn and Eldridge kneel before James buckling on the
suit

SANBORN
You know you don’t have to go down
there man we already have the bot
half way out

JAMES
It will be alright

Sanborn puts the helmet on
SANBORN
First day I was thinking you might
want to take it easy

Now enclosed in the suit James is ready to go

JAMES
Let’s rock ‘n roll

James heads downrange a jaunty bounce to his step

In stark contrast to Thompson’s cautious lumbering gait he
seems eager almost happy to approach the bomb

The guys watch him go

ELDRIDGE
He’s a rowdy boy

SANBORN
He’s reckless
EXT BAGHDAD STREET

Without warning James tosses a round metal canister a smoke
grenade into the middle of the street

ECU canister jets explode propelling a billowing cloud of
gray smoke

EXT HUMVEE

Sanborn looks on in confusion as the dense smoke fills the
street obscuring his view of James

SANBORN

No answer James disappears into the smoke

SANBORN
(walkie)

No answer

SANBORN

of the road

No answer

Sanborn can no longer see James through the smoke

He climbs up on top of the Humvee to get a better look But
he gets only a partial view

SANBORN

(to Eldridge)
Get up on that wall Tell me what

Eldridge leaps onto a nearby narrow stone wall feet
precariously balanced

Hell I don’t know I’1l1 let you
know when I’m standing over it

We see the world from James’ point of view the city takes on
an intense dreamy hue as if somehow we’re in some sort of
fugue state

James walks on and the world returns to normal as he nears an
intersection guarded on either side by a HUMVEE and several
SOLDIERS when

Suddenly a red-and-white TAXI swerves past the SOLDIERS on
the left side of the intersection

The soldiers take cover and shout contradictory commands -
“Stop the car” “Get Down Don’t Move Back up Out of the
vehicle”

The TAXI BRAKES in front of James

EXT HUMVEE
Sanborn and Eldridge can hear the shouting but the lingering

smoke still obscures their sight

protrude from the mess

Moment of decision

Moving quickly James removes rubble and trash to expose the
wires and the artillery shells

He kneels down into the rubble pile Touches the bomb

Then with great care he removes the blasting cap from the
bomb making sure that it doesn’t make contact with the metal
edges of the artillery shell

He cuts one wire leading to the blasting cap

Then he flips the artillery round over and cuts the other
wire

We find a WIRE TERMINAL attached to the alley wall where on
a different day the battery would have been connected to
initiate the bomb

business suits flee the United Nations building
Parked beside the building is a blue sedan

The Humvee passes through a roadblock stops and James gets
out to talk to an IRAQI SERGEANT

Due to his current position in the parking lot James can’t
see the blue sedan that everyone is running from

TRAQI SERGEANT
It’s behind the wall

JAMES
Did you see any wires Any smoke

TRAQI SERGEANT
No I didn’t look

JAMES
So how do you know it’s a bomb

IRAQI SERGEANT
The car has been parked there
illegally and the suspension is
sagging so there’s definitely
something heavy in the trunk

JAMES
Why don’t you peek inside and tell
me what you see

IRAQI SERGEANT

You want me to go close to it In

stops

On a third-floor balcony unseen by the soldiers a INSURGENT
SNIPER takes aim

-- a SHOT rings out

-- bullet strikes the car

-- it bursts into flames

-- a plume of flame rushes out from the gas tank like a
blowtorch

-- we see the flames through James’ helmet

“It’s coming from over here” shout INFANTRY on the grounds
outside the building as they FIRE M4s at the sniper’s

Their bullets hit concrete missing the sniper A TEAM of

James backs away from the fire toward Sanborn who is now
running toward him with a fire extinguisher Eldridge follows
just behind Sanborn

It takes Sanborn an instant to process the insult top cover
in this case is the junior man’s job

Shaking his head Sanborn runs to the building

Eldridge positions himself at the top of a staircase
hunkered down behind a low concrete wall

James sprays the extinguisher into the roaring fire Flames
lick his suit

Sanborn pounds up a long flight of stairs

ridge-ravine complex where the mercenaries and soldiers have
taken cover

SNIPER POV

The wispy form of the two mercenaries lying on the ridge can
be faintly seen

INT BUILDING

The sniper’s muzzle FLASHES

RIDGE

The mercenary team leader hoists himself up into a low crawl
only to --

--take the bullet square in the chest
--spinning him off the ridge
-- face first into the ravine

-- his back a pulped and bloody mess from the exit wound

RAVINE

Jimmy jumps down from the ridge to check for a pulse

JIMMY
He’s dead

Now the men plummet into a full-bore panic and everyone
starts talking at once

Sanborn prepares to shoot at the men in the building

Sanborn squeezes the trigger only to hear
CLICK of an empty chamber

SANBORN
I’m out of ammo

JAMES
Huh

SANBORN
I’m out of ammo

JAMES
(shouting over his
shoulder)
Eldridge We need ammo

RAVINE

Eldridge frantically searches a few nearby backpacks

RIDGE
JAMES
I need that ammo man
RAVINE

ELDRIDGE
I’m looking Where is it

JAMES OS
Check the dead guy

Eldridge flips over the body of the slain contractor His
chest is pulped

Nestled in the gore are several 50 magazines Eldridge grabs
them with shaky hands and passes them up to James
RIDGE

James passes the ammo to Sanborn He slams it into the
receiver

JAMES
Same target

SANBORN
Got it

Sanborn pulls the trigger Click

ECU Hand cycling the weapon Finger pulling trigger Bolt
catching jammed

SANBORN
It’s jammed The blood is making it
jam

Sanborn removes the clip and hands it back to James who hands
it back down to Eldridge in the ravine instructing him

JAMES
Eldridge you got to clean the
blood off the bullets The blood is
making it jam

Eldridge takes the magazine and rubs the top bullet to no
good effect for the dust on his hands sticks to the blood
and the blood sticks to the bullet

He rubs harder only making it dirtier

James peers down and realizes that Eldridge is lost

JAMES
Spit and rub man Spit on them

Eldridge tries to spit on the bullets
His mouth is too dry to produce salvia
He tries again Nothing

James sees his escalating despair and slides down the ridge
coming next to Eldridge

JAMES
Use your camel (referring to the
Camelback water canteen)

James squeezes the nipple of Eldridge’s Camel and directs the
water to drip on the bullets It sort of works

Sitting side by side now they rub away the grime and polish
the bullets to a bright shine

JAMES
Youre doing good man You’re
okay I’m going to keep you safe

James takes the clean bullets and climbs back to the ridge
telling Eldridge

JAMES
Scan your sectors

RIDGE

Sanborn loads the clean bullets and fires

SCOPE POV

One figure on the roof is hit The other man crawls back and
out of sight

RIDGE

JAMES
Twenty meters to the right of the
building You got a target

SANBORN
I got him

JAMES
Fire when ready

SCOPE POV

Sanborn’s bullet strikes the ground a dozen feet in front of
the man kicking up a harmless puff of dust

The man gets up and runs towards the building while firing
his AK-47 back at Sanborn and James His carbine’s muzzle
flash ineffective at this great range sparkles in the
bright day

RIDGE
JAMES

He’s moving to the building Follow
him You got him

SANBORN
Got him

Sanborn pulls the trigger

SCOPE POV

Sanborn’s bullet strikes the fleeing man in the upper chest
blood spurting as the large round throws him dead to the
ground

RIDGE
JAMES

Thanks for playing
SCOPE POV

The sniper in the building appears in the window

BUILDING

The insurgent sniper team leans out the window and fires at
James and Sanborn

RIDGE

The bullet snaps near James and Sanborn

JAMES
Window Window

SANBORN
Got it

Sanborn fires

SCOPE POV

Miss Sanborn’s bullet strikes the building just below the
window and the insurgent team withdraws inside

JAMES
He’s still there

The insurgent having run to the other side of the building
now appears in the other window the left window James sees
his barrel

JAMES
Left window Left window Got him

SANBORN
Got him

Sanborn turns his head away from the gun and makes an audible
exhale to release tension the sniper breath control
technique Then he fires a hit the insurgent slumps in the
window

JAMES
He’s down
SCOPE POV

The roof of the tall building in the distance bobs in and out
of view the scope dances at this range

James scans the area Silence

DESERT WIDE

We mark the passage of time with dust devils spinning across
a horizon of lengthening shadows

EXTINT DEEP RAVINE HOURS LATER

The sun lower in the sky Around the pit the fallen TEAM
LEADER has been pushed to one side and the living are
hanging on to their sanity

Eldridge and the remaining contractors have exhausted their
water supply

Eldridge is in a sentry position facing east in the
direction of the railroad tracks The other two contractors
are in sentry positions facing south and north

Sanborn and James are in EXACTLY the same position as when we
left them exposed to the elements Desert heat and sand have
taken their toll on Sanborn especially
EXT SANBORN POV

The scope BLURS as Sanborn’s vision fails for a moment

RIDGE
James notices Sanborn’s fatigue
JAMES
Eldridge grab me the juice out of
an MRE

Eldridge digs around the dead TEAM LEADER’S backpack and
retrieves a packet of juice which he passes to James

James inserts the straw into the juice pack

He hesitates not sure if Sanborn will accept the gesture
after all the hostility that’s passed between them

James brings the straw to Sanborn’s lips
At first Sanborn keeps his attention on the rifle scope

JAMES
Drink

With some discomfort Sanborn opens his sun-scorched lips
sips

RAVINE

Eldridge scans the horizon--

--a small HERD of GOATS amble along the railroad tracks
He rubs his eyes looks again--

--Somewhere within the herd a flutter of fabric--
Eldridge stiffens

ELDRIDGE
Uh Will

JAMES
Yeah

and

ELDRIDGE
At your six o’clock Movement on
the tracks

JAMES

Deal with it

ELDRIDGE
Uh okay

Eldridge looks down his scope unsure James keeps his focus
forward on the building

ELDRIDGE
Should I fire

JAMES
Your call

Eldridge shifts his weight onto his rifle
Another flutter of movement at the edge of the tracks

Eldridge pulls the trigger Then he pulls it again And
again emptying his magazine at the distant target

The goats scatter revealing a lifeless BODY draped across
the tracks

Eldridge slumps let’s go of his rifle

TIME CUT TO

RAVINE SEVERAL HOURS LATER

Dusk Shadows fall over James and Sanborn both of whom
remain lying in the exact same sniping position although now
they are covered head to toe in sand

There’s no movement in the house No movement on the far
ridge No sign of life anywhere beyond their encampment

It’s just them and the sky and the desert

JAMES
I think we’re done

CUT TO

INT CAMP VICTORY JAMES’ TRAILER NIGHT

Play time James and Sanborn square off drunk swaying red-
faced fists clenched When Sanborn nods James punches him
in the stomach

James smiles he looks good The unleashed aggression is like
a vitamin to him

JAMES
That’s what you get for hitting
your team-leader motherfucker

With difficulty Sanborn straightens up and stumbles out of
the trailer

SANBORN
Be right back I gotta piss

James lurches towards Eldridge

JAMES
Owen another round That’s an
order
ELDRIDGE
(imitating a young
recruit)

Yes Sir Sergeant James Sir
Youre not very good with people
are you -- but you’re a natural
warrior

JAMES
You acquitted yourself well on the
field of battle today Specialist

They clink cups Eldridge gulps his whiskey
James collapses in his chair
Eldridge sits down carefully

ELDRIDGE
I was scared

JAMES
Everyone is a coward about
something
(beat)
You did good

As Sanborn loudly stumbles back into the room he notices by
the door something a little odd under James’ bed a box It’s
odd because there is nothing else in the barren room besides
Army-issue furniture lights and the whiskey they’ve been
drinking

Curious Sanborn retrieves the box out and sets it ona
makeshift coffee table to get a better look

SANBORN
Just what do we have here Will has
possessions I didn’t know you
owned anything Will

ELDRIDGE
Let’s see what you got

Sanborn pulls out a weathered snapshot of a baby boy

SANBORN
What’s that

JAMES
That’s my son He’s a real tough
little bastard Nothing like me

SANBORN
You’re married

JAMES

Well I had a girlfriend She got
pregnant and we got married and
then we divorced Or I thought we
divorced She’s still in the house
and she says we’re still together
So I don’t know What does that
make her

SANBORN
Dumb - for still being with your
ass
JAMES
(hotly)

She ain’t dumb She’s just loyal
that’s all (beat) What about you
guys - what have you got

SANBORN
My problem is the girl I like I
can’t stop from talking about
babies
JAMES
Give her your sperm stud Make
babies

SANBORN
Nah

JAMES

Go on you chickenshit Do it

SANBORN
No I know when I’m ready and I’m
not ready for that yet
(looking around the box
finds a circuit board)
And what do we have here

JAMES
(embarrassed)
Components Bomb parts Signatures

SANBORN
I see that But what are they doing
under your bed

James pulls out a circuit and gazes reverently at the
mechanical design

JAMES
This one is from the UN building
flaming car Dead man switch -
boom This guy was good I like
him This one was from our first
call together This box is full of
stuff that almost killed me

Eldridge rummages through the box and finds a gold ring
hanging from a cheap chain

He dangles the ring in front of James

ELDRIDGE
What’s this one from Will

JAMES
That’s my wedding ring Like I
said stuff that almost killed me
(beat)
I think it’s interesting to hold
something in your hands that could
have killed any one of us

SANBORN
(looking at the circuit
board)
It’s a piece of junk from Radio

Shack

Eldridge ever unsure allies with James

ELDRIDGE
It’s interesting
JAMES SANBORN
I agree I think it’s I think that punch was harder
interesting too than I hit you Therefore I
owe you a punch So get up
motherfucker

James leaps up pleased to end the conversation

Sanborn follows clapping his hands -- cruising for a
bruising

ELDRIDGE
Hold on we need some rules No
face shots
SANBORN
(laughing)
There’s gonna be a face shot

Eldridge picks up a magic marker and tells James to take off
his shirt

Then he draws a bulls-eye on James’ bared stomach

And as he does he notices knotty scar tissue

ELDRIDGE
What happened
JAMES
My mother dropped me at birth
ELDRIDGE SANBORN
Looks like frag scars Let it go Eldridge

James smiles raises his arms exposing his midsection to
Sanborn

Sanborn winds up for a powerful blow He leans back then
launches a gut punch that knocks James to the floor

James lies there in a heap laughing

When he gets up he’s laughing so hard that gleeful tears run
down his face

SANBORN
You like that

JAMES
That all you got

Now Sanborn raises his arms bracing for the blow

James feints a right cross fakes a jab then grabs Sanborn
by the neck and unleashes a brutal uppercut to the solar
plexus Sanborn collapses moaning in pain

JAMES
(laughing)
That’s got to hurt

ELDRIDGE
You alright

SANBORN
Yeah

JAMES
Get up bitch

James extends his hand to help Sanborn off the floor

But when Sanborn reaches for help James rushes him wildly
like a football tackle knocking him back to the floor and
in a sudden fit of aggression he then jumps on Sanborn’s
chest pins his arms with his knees and clasps his throat

JAMES

What have you got now
SANBORN

Get off me
JAMES

Come on what have you got

SANBORN
Get off of me you freak

Sanborn tries to buck James off but he can’t dislodge the
former Ranger

Sanborn redoubles his efforts throwing his weight this way
and that Still James remains on top -- his face twisted
with a macho snarl

JAMES
We got a wild one here

Sanborn bucks harder But instead of knocking James loose
his kicking and struggling to get free spurs James to even
deeper levels of male weirdness And as Sanborn kicks and
bucks underneath him James pumps his hand like a cowboy at a
rodeo crying out

JAMES
I’m riding him That’s right He’s
a wild one and I’m riding him
COME ON BITCH

Now Sanborn reaches for his boot knife
EcU knife blade snapping open

Sanborn jams the blade against James’ throat and their eyes
lock

James smiles like a child He pats Sanborn’s head and laughs

JAMES
I’m just kidding motherfucker
Shit

At last Sanborn is released James pats him on the chest

JAMES
Youre alright Sanborn
(to Eldridge)
Owen get this guy another drink

CUT TO

EXT CAMP VICTORY HOURS LATER

Sanborn too drunk to stand is being guided across the
barracks square by Eldridge and James When they come to
Eldridge’s trailer James shoulders Sanborn by himself and
Eldridge goes inside

ELDRIDGE
Later

It’s not easy for James to carry Sanborn alone and Sanborn
nearly slips to the ground

JAMES
You need to go on a diet

They walk a little farther to Sanborn’s trailer passing a
SOLDIER who looks at them curiously Drinking is not allowed
on US bases in Irag James brushes aside the officious look
saying “he hurt his knee” and guides Sanborn up a set of
stairs into Sanborn’s trailer

INT SANBORN’S TRAILER
James eases Sanborn onto a cot and heads for the door

JAMES
Get some rest

Sanborn mumbles drunkenly

SANBORN
Hey James do you think I have what
it takes to put on the suit

JAMES
(beat)
Hell no
(Beat)
Good night boy

INT JAMES’ TRAILER LATER THAT NIGHT

James stumbles inside flops on the bed and takes another
swig of whiskey

He lies there and stares at his bomb helmet which is sitting
on a desk adjacent to his cot

He looks at the helmet and reaches for it

Then he brings the helmet over his head and adjusts the
straps and unlocks the glass protective masks so that it
snaps down over his face and his entire head is sheathed in
the protective metal

A man encased in his armor

He leans back in the bed and we HEAR the rasp of James
BREATHING daydreamingas he re-experiences the feeling of
a bomb in his hands the morbid thrill

CUT TO

James shoots Eldridge a look Eldridge shrugs

JAMES

It’s a privilege

Nearby an OLD IRAQI MAN with a DONKEY drawn cart is
unloading new bricks to repair the building

Farther up the road a good distance from the building are
two parked Humvees Nearby James and his team are talking to
a small cluster of SOLDIERS

Eldridge gives Cambridge the drill

ELDRIDGE
This is a pretty standard mission
Were just here to pick up some
ordnance Sergeant James is going
to go see what the deal is
Hopefully we’re gone in a couple
of minutes

JAMES

Guys we got to gear up
SANBORN

For what
JAMES

Security hasn’t gone in Let’s just
go in quiet radios off

ELDRIDGE
Glad you came

CAMBRIDGE
Stay safe

INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING

James Sanborn and Eldridge enter a landing The floor is
very wet They cross it and come to a room that has been
severely damaged by a bomb with rubble everywhere and
exposed electrical wires dangling from the ceiling and
busted pipes gushing water A tea pot sits on a STOVE
steaming hot and a plate on the table has bread on it

WATER LOGGED ROOM

They gingerly investigate a large cavernous room with leaky
pipes dripping water onto an oil-slicked floor We HEAR their
breathing the water DROPLETS falling Moving tactically
covering all sides of their approach they press deeper into
the building down

CORRIDOR
A dark corridor which the insurgents have strewn with glass

as an early-warning system Advancing slowly glass CRUNCHING
underfoot they pass through this corridor into

CLASSROOM

A classroom lined with student’s desks and chairs beyond
which lies another room James and Sanborn spin quietly into
this room rifles raised while Eldridge hangs back to cover
the corridor

INSURGENT LIVING SPACE

They find themselves in a recently used living area A teapot
cooking on a bunsen burner hisses steam Mattresses and
bedding line the walls of the room The walls are decorated
with Jihadist slogans and a video camera for making
recruiting videos has pride of place on a tripod in the
center of the room

Sanborn checks under the mattresses for hidden explosives
finds none and exchanges a worried look with James

Moving as one unit they spin into the next room

EMPTY ROOM

It’s empty another forboding large space strewn with rubble
and garbage They pass through this area and push open a door
to --

BOMB FACTORY
Santa’s bomb making factory

In contrast to the spare spaces they’ve just passed through
this room is overflowing with the tools of a an insurgency
that uses bombs as its primary weapon electronics and
explosives of all kinds are everywhere artillery shells
boxes of batteries plastic explosives military manuals
rockets grenades stacks of dynamite tools magnifying
glasses and soldering guns

Though a few of these munitions bear the stamps of foreign
militaries most bear insignias in English It is
ironically a cache of armaments that formerly belonged to
the American military

The men weave through the piles of explosives slowly
checking every space where a human could possibly be hiding

At last they’re satisfied

SANBORN
Clear

Eldridge draws near to one desk where a cigarette burns in an
ashtray

ELDRIDGE
This cigarette is still smoking

SANBORN
This is all our shit Motherfucking
gold mine Watch out for trips

BACK OF ROOM

In the back half of the room a plastic curtain hangs over a
work table forming a make-shift sterile room

Smelling the copper odor of blood and death emanating from
behind that curtain James pushes the plastic to one side

He draws near to a table where he sees the DEAD BODY of a
YOUNG BOY wearing pants but no shirt Flies buzz over his
bloody bare chest

JAMES
I got something

Sanborn and Eldridge come beside him and approach the body
cautiously

The dead young man’s chest has been cut open An artillery
shell is shoved inside the cavity where the heart used to
beat Wires protrude from the shell

James shakes his head no as Sanborn moves closer to the body
and inspects the wiring in the chest

The boy’s FACE half in shadow is so disfigured by bruises
that it’s hard to identify But it might be someone familiar
to James

JAMES
I know this kid His name is
Beckham He sells DVDs

Sanborn ignores that and turns to Eldridge

SANBORN
You ever see a body bomb before

Eldridge shakes his head pulling his neck scarf up over his
nose

SANBORN
This is disgusting let’s get out
of here

JAMES

Eldridge grab all the C4 and det
cord you can get your hands on
Let’s get the rest of it out of
here and just blow it in place

SANBORN
Roger that

Sanborn and Eldridge leave James alone with the body

He stares at the boy

EXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING

Cambridge with limited Iraqi language skills is trying to
speak to a MAN piling rocks in the back of his donkey cart

CAMBRIDGE
What are you doing Moving the

The Iraqi peasant replies in Arabic motioning to the rocks
and his cart

CAMBRIDGE
That’s very nice It’s a little
unsafe today So maybe - I don’t

know - I’m thinking maybe we should
move

INT BODY BOMB

James steps away

EXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING
Sanborn and Eldridge meet up outside

SANBORN
You okay

EDLDRIDGE
Yeah You
INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING MOMENTS LATER
James turns away from the body Thinks

Eldridge arrives with the C4 The look on James’ face
concerns him

ELDRIDGE
You alright man

JAMES
Yeah no one in or out

Eldridge nods Makes a hasty exit

James pulls C4 blocks from his pack and arranges them around
the body He plugs a blasting cap into the C4 In doing so he
finds himself drawn to the dead boy’s eyes which seem
somehow to stare directly at him

James tries to keep his feelings in check and his mind on the
task by arranging the charges and preparing the detonation

But he can’t The war has finally reached him
JAMES
(into walkie)

Cancel the det

In one fluid motion James removes the charges and takes off
his helmet

He closes the boy’s eyes
And slams his fists on the table

CUT TO

INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING

James carefully checks the boy’s body for trip wires then
proceeds the snip the wires which were sown into the boy’s
stomach

One by one he cuts them

He inserts his hands into the boy’s abdomen and removes the
artillery shell bomb that had been diabolically placed there

He wipes his face smearing blood then covers the body in a
white cloth

JAMES
(into walkie)
I’m coming down

The boy’s blood seeps through the cloth and stains it red

INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING STAIRS

James carries the boy’s body down the narrow corridor The
head and feet bump the sides

EXT STREETBOMBED OUT BUILDING

James brings the body out carries it to a blue and white
pickup TRUCK emblazoned with the logo of the Iraqi National
Police pulls up to their position

A pair of POLICEMEN get out and after a few words with James
they load the body

EXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING

James watches the police truck drive away He then moves for
the Humvee motioning for Cambridge to load up

SANBORN
Very weird

CAMBRIDGE AT THE DONKEY CART

Cambridge losing patience with what is now a small crowd of
Iraqis motions with his M4

CAMBRIDGE
Please just move Please Ishmee
(pronouncing the Arabic
incorrectly)

The crowd slowly disperses amid grumbling and cursing
Cambridge waves patronizingly at them as they go saying
“thank you bye-bye” etc He doesn’t notice that one of the
older men has left on the ground a white rice bag

INT HUMVEE
Simultaneously the conversation in the Humvee continues

ELDRIDGE
But then Will’s pretty weird He
keeps bomb parts under his bed

SANBORN
I bet you he doesn’t keep any of
these parts under his bed

James cracks the door of the Humvee leans inside sees
Cambridge -

JAMES
(shouting to Cambridge)
Let’s go

Through the HUMVEE windshield Cambridge now pleased that
the crowd has gone waves good-bye to the entire
neighborhood and hearing James steps towards the Humvee
passing the white rice bag which suddenly --

--explodes in a A SICKENING BLAST

--obliterating Cambridge

--sending his head crashing into the HUMVEE along with a
could of debris which instantly blackens the windshield and
blots out the sun and our view of everything -

INTEXT HUMVEE

CRIES of “IED” “IED” as our three soldiers stumble out of

We follow Eldridge stunned as he walks into the aftermath
and finds a smoking helmet on the ground

He picks it up

Its nylon cover is burning the inside is charred

Eldridge looks down and sees body parts and bits of uniform
strewn on the ground

ELDRIDGE
Where’s Cambridge Cambridge Come

James turns to a nearby INFANTRY GUARD

JAMES
Excuse me soldier are you in

JAMES
That guy over there could be an
insurgent (referring to the DVD
merchant) How do we know he’s not

telling them where to drop mortars

GUARD
I think he’s just selling DVDs

JAMES
He’s a security risk You should
get rid of him

GUARD

an armed American would come to her house

James steps back Her cursing grows fiercer She raises her

KALIM
Be careful The gun can go off

Undaunted she throws the tray at James He twists to avoid

HEAD badly on the concrete archway as he runs out of the

EXT IRAQI HOUSESTREET

James is shaken He looks around and down the street He

navigates the busy Iraqi neighborhood at night running down
streets teeming with SHOPPERS who stare at him ominously
dodging traffic moving past OLD MEN smoking at a CAFE who
note his panic by a BUTCHER SHOP where an entire COW CARCASS
is being unloaded and on and on we stay with his eyes

EXT CAMP VICTORY GATE NIGHT

James hands held high over his head walks up to one of the
camp’s check-points shouting

JAMES
USA Friendly coming in

Powerful flood lights switch on blinding him Then the
screaming of hyped up guards

GUARDS GUARDS
Stop get the fuck down On Don’t fucking move
your knees

GUARDS GUARDS
Stop On your knees on your

knees

James sinks to his knees
GUARD

GUARD
Open your fucking jacket Cover

James unzips his sweatshirt and declares

JAMES
I have a weapon

A guard armed with a shotgun charges out of the glare and
kicks James to the ground pinning his knee into his back

GUARD
Searching
The guard finds James’ pistol He shouts
GUARD JAMES
Gun Weapon’s clear Like I said (beat) Do you
want to look at my ID

GUARD
What are you doing out here

JAMES

(gasping)
I was at a whore house

GUARD

CRACKLES to life

I repeat do you copy Do you have

your ears on James
JAMES

(into walkie)
Yeah this is James What’s up

INT HUMVEE MINUTES LATER

In a bustling parking lot aglow with headlights from Humvees
and troop carries we find James running towards one Humvee
which he jumps into Sanborn is at the wheel and not amused

SANBORN
We have a tanker explosion in the
Green Zone We have to do a post-
blast assessment see if it was a
suicide bomber and if so how he
pulled it off
(beat)
So where did you say you were
again

JAMES
I didn’t Sergeant Let’s go

SANBORN
What happened to your head James

James gives no reply He turns to Eldridge

JAMES
Ready Game face buddy

As the Humvee rolls out of the base

SANBORN PRELAP
USA Friendlies coming in

CUT TO

EXT BAGHDAD STREET LATE NIGHT

A helicopter spotlight illuminates a Hieronymus Bosch
nightmare of tangled limbs and body parts Then fires smoke
and the cries of wailing grievers and wounded carried on
stretchers ambulances police fire trucksthe ghastly
frantic aftermath of a major detonation

Their combat flashlights send piercing white beams into this
grim spectacle while in the distance a huge fire a GLOWING
RED INFERNO at the end of the block lights what we now see
is a blast radius that extends for a nearly a mile

Moving towards the glowing fire past ten foot high flames
and the remains of houses pulverized to concrete and glass
rubble piles past screaming women and more bloody wounded
being carried away by IRAQI POLICE

they pause to try and help Iragi police save a man pinned
under a car He’s dragged away like a rag doll

They press on towards the inferno and stop when they notice a
hunk of metal

JAMES
Oil tanker

SANBORN
Yup Pretty long flight

Moving ahead the men split up navigating different paths
through this hectic apocalypse

ELDRIDGE

A Bhurka-clad WOMAN appears out of the distant flames and
haze looking disoriented in apparent shock Behind her is a
blazing car

On the ground beside the car lies a single black loafer

Eldridge sees the lone shoe and is at a loss to process its
significance

Another mind-numbing soul-numbing casualty of war

SANBORN

At a gigantic rubble pile Sanborn reaches down to remove
chunks of stone covering a BODY

The stone slides away but another falls in its place

Sanborn looks down sees a second man or what’s left of a
man head and torso but no legs -- just stumps twitching

Around him GRIEVING FAMILIES pick through the dead and dying
with IRAQI MEDICS
JAMES

Drawing near to the inferno he moves past burning palm trees
which erupt into a fountain of embers

And comes at last to the burning steel carcase of

OIL TANKER
an OIL TANKER

From what’s left of the twisted metal sub-frame flames twenty
feet high scorch the night like the maw of hell on earth

James stares transfixed by the burningthe imprint of some
insurgent’s plan

His face hardens now in a way we haven’t seen before and as
the fire flickers on his features he seems lost in a private
war of his own

The insurgents are out there somewhere

Ahab and the Whale

SANBORN AND ELDRIDGE

Sanborn and Eldridge look helplessly at a girl who is trapped
on the landing of a half-destroyed building She cries for
her father

Behind them several platoons of US SOLDIERS and IRAQI
POLICE arrive to secure the boundaries of the blast zone

CUT TO

EDGE OF BLAST RADIUS

James approaches a LEMON GROVE which lies just beyond the
fire’s reach

As Sanborn and Eldridge walk up behind him James touches a
UNBLEMISHED LEMON nestled among the thorns

JAMES
This is the edge of the blast
radius

Sanborn comes into view James nods to him then stares into
the distance a man possessed

JAMES
So where’s our trigger man

SANBORN
Burnt up in the flames Suicide
bomber You’ll never find a body

JAMES

But what if there was no body What
if it was a remote det

(beat)
A really good bad guy hides out in
the dark right This is a perfect
vantage point outside the blast
radius to set back and watch us --

ELDRIDGE
You want to go out there

JAMES
Yes I do

ELDRIDGE
I could stand to get in some
trouble

Sanborn looks at James and looks at the bandage on his head

SANBORN
No man this is bullshit
You got --what-- three infantry

platoons here whose job it is to go
haji hunting That’s not our job

JAMES
You don’t say ‘No’ to me Sergeant
I say ‘No’ to you You know there
are guys watching us right now
(on the move)
We’re going

James glowers at Sanborn and Eldridge and moves deeper into
an unlit field behind the lemon grove

Eldridge shoots Sanborn a sympathetic glance and follows
James

Sanborn watches them recede into the darkness Then he runs
after his team
EXT FIELD

They move across the dark field three abreast into the
enveloping night

We gradually lose sight of them in BLACKNESS Seeing nothing
we HEAR however their BREATHING and gravel CRUNCHING
underfoot

After a long moment of no visibilitythey’re faintly
visible again in dim florescent light and we see
EXT PARKING LOT

A shadowy parking lot filled with marooned cars beyond which
lies a neighborhood of one-story homes and narrow alleys

Amid the cars the men come across the bullet-shaped hull of
an intact oil tanker They crouch beside it whispering

JAMES
We know where the oil tanker came
from

SANBORN

It’s the same kind

JAMES
We’re close These alleys are
probably set up in a grid We’re
going to split up to flush them
out Sanborn take the first alley
Eldridge take two I got three
Rally point at your intersection
Ready Move

SANBORN
Wait Rally point When

But James has already dashed into the third alley

ALLEY TWO

Eldridge walking slowly not sure he likes being alone

ALLEY THREE

James runs confidently sees a few kids in a doorway and
tells them to scoot

ALLEY ONE

Sanborn runs to make up for being the last to leave

ALLEY TWO

Eldridge peers into an abandoned house He thinks he hears
something

Spins

It’s nothing

ALLEY ONE
Sanborn slows Catches his breath when suddenly --

--BLAM BLAM BLAM - the staccato of GUNFIRE slaps off the
concrete--

Sanborn dashes full speed back to the alley’s opening

ALLEY THREE

James turns runs hard back into--

SANBORN AND JAMES
--the first intersection where he sees Sanborn and shouts

JAMES
You got contact

SANBORN
Who is it What’s going on

JAMES
What have you got

SANBORN
It’s Eldridge
ALLEY TWO

They come to Eldridge’s alley where they see that a body lies
on the ground They run to it

JAMES
Man down

SANBORN
Eldridge
As they draw close they see not Eldridge but the BODY of an
Iraqi insurgent dead from gunshot wounds

JAMES
It’s not him

SANBORN
He’s gone

A moment of decision
SANBORN
That way is towards the tanker
troops
They run down the alley into a maze of narrow streets and
dimly lit corridors

NARROW STREET

Turning a corner they catch a fleeting glimpse of Eldridge
being dragged away by TWO INSURGENTS

Before they can fire the men are gone

CORNER

They run to this corner and prepare to spin around it and
shoot

James hands Sanborn his flashlight
JAMES

Hit ‘em with both lights One two

three
DARK CORNER
They spin around the corner and flash light revealing NOTHING
but an empty street
NEXT ALLEY

They sprint to the next block and again see Eldridge being
dragged

JAMES
One two three
Again they aim and spin Sanborn shines the light - beams
Eldridge and the two insurgents -- and James FIRES two short
bursts from his M4

The two insurgents collapse

But Eldridge also goes down

Running up James and Sanborn see the insurgents are
motionless shot clean

One bullet however has gone astray into Eldridge’s leg and
he’s bleeding profusely

JAMES
Eldridge you okay

ELDRIDGE
I’m hit

As James and Sanborn apply first aide

SANBORN
You hit him in the leg
ELDRIDGE
(panting)
Am I dead
SANBORN

No youre alright

JAMES
You’re fine

Eldridge looks to Sanborn for confirmation that wound is
indeed not mortal

ELDRIDGE
Am I dead Am I dead Am I dead

As Sanborn and James yank Eldridge off the ground he screams
in pain

CUT TO

INT CAMP VICTORY SHOWER STALLS LATER THAT NIGHT

James trudges into an empty bathroom and looks at himself in
the mirror Sees the faraway expression of a man lost to the
war
His shirt is crimson with Eldridge’s blood

He steps inside a shower stall still dressed in full battle
rattle and turns on the hot faucet

The water streams over himand he lets go punching the
wall thrashing his arms then sinking down sobbing broken

as his uniform soaks through and the reddish pink water
swirls down the drain

EXT CAMP VICTORY HEAD SHED MORNING
Looking fine and wearing a fresh clean uniform James strides
purposely out of the head shed toward a waiting Humvee in the

parking lot

He sees on the other side of the parking lot none other
than Beckham who happily shouts to him

BECKHAM
Hey what’s up man Hey Boomala
Boomala wanna buys some DVDs play
some soccer
James stops He stares What can he say The boy is fine

His jihad was pointless Insane

Unable to face the kid and unwilling to explain James turns
away and stiffly gets into the Humvee

The Humvee roars to life and drives away
Beckham watches it go hurt confused

Prelap the ROTAR WASH of a helicopter preparing to fly

EXT CAMP VICTORY TARMAC MORNING

Two SOLDIERS load Eldridge strapped to a stretcher onto a
transport helicopter

Sanborn and James run across the helipad to wish him good-
bye

JAMES
How you doing Doc says youll be
okay
ELDRIDGE
My femur is shattered in nine
places He said I’1l be walking in
six months if I’m lucky

JAMES
Six ain’t bad

ELDRIDGE
Not bad It fucking sucks man

Eldridge is jostled as he gets put down he cries out in
pain

ELDRIDGE
(angrily)
You see that That’s what happens
when you shoot somebody you
motherfucker

JAMES
I’m sorry Sorry

ELDRIDGE
Youre sorry Fuck you Will
Really fuck you Thanks for saving
my life but we didn’t have to go
out looking for trouble so you
could get your adrenaline fix you
fucking war mongerer

James is crestfallen

A US MEDIVAC CREW MEMBER looks at Sanborn and gives a hand
signal to wrap it up time to go

ELDRIDGE
(to Sanborn)
Take care of yourself Owen

SANBORN
(grabbing Eldridge’s hand)

Get home safe See you on the other
side

As the helicopter door slams closed Eldridge shouts “lets
get out of this desert”

James and Sanborn step back from the rotor wash

James turns to say something to Sanborn But he’s already
walking away
SOLDIER PRELAP
(shouting)
Don’t move If you keep walking we
will shoot you

EXT BAGHDAD STREET CHECKPOINT LATE AFTERNOON

A young SERGEANT at a checkpoint raises his M4 and shouts
nervously at a bewildered Iraqi MAN in a BLACK SUIT The
man’s hands are raised He’s standing alone in the middle of
a square which has been cleared of all other pedestrians and
which is flanked by US ARMY soldiers and a TRANSLATOR
disguising his identity by wearing a black ski mask

SERGEANT
Don’t move Keep that translator
back

TRANSLATOR

But the bomb was forced on him
SERGEANT
Don’t move Stay still If you keep
walking we will shoot you
SHOUTING IN ARABIC as the translator conveys this command
TITLE
DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY’S ROTATION 2

James wearing his bomb suit approaches the scene while
Sanborn follows close behind him in the Humvee

SERGEANT
Keep that translator back

One of the soldiers grabs the translator while others
seeing James shout “give him room” “let him through” etc

TRANSLATOR
(to the soldier)
But the bomb was forced on him
Against his will He is not a bad
man

James and the Sergeant huddle
SERGEANT
He came walking up to our
checkpoint said he had a bomb
strapped to him He was sorry He
didn’t want it to go off Then he
started begging us to take it off
him

TRANSLATOR
(to James)
Help this man He’s not a bad man

SANBORN
Not a bad man He’s got a bomb
strapped to him
(to James)
This is a trap He wants to draw us
close

JAMES
(to translator)
Tell him to open his shirt slowly
I need to see what’s inside

The translator SHOUTS in Arabic

The MAN unbuttons his jacket revealing

Clamped to his chest is a metal cage locked with padlocks
and loaded with blocks of C4 wrapped in nails

JAMES
(to the soldier)
Id need a seventy five
perimeter
(to translator)

meter

Tell him to get on his knees and

touch the sky Get down

The translator SHOUTS The man in the BLACK SUIT gripped
with despair drops to his knees and raises his hands

SERGEANT
Can we just shoot him

As James considers that option when --

TRANSLATOR
NO Hes not a bad man

He has a

family The bomb was forced on him
He is asking for help Only help
JAMES
(to translator)
I want you to get back I got it

Sanborn pulls James aside for a private moment and pleads
with him to be careful

SANBORN
We’ve had our differences
Eldridge It happened That’s
water under the bridge But this --
this is suicide

James considers Sanborn’s right of course But he can’t
help himself Like a moth to a flame this is what he does

JAMES
That’s why it’s called a suicide
bomb right

Sanborn reluctantly seals James in the helmet

They bang fists

DOWNRANGE NEAR SUICIDE BOMBER

James grabs a nearby soldier’s walkie then starts the walk
downrange Soldiers moving back to their perimeter
PEDESTRIANS gathering for a look Soldiers scattering them
quickly

Black Suit smiles thinly as James nears James nods at him
The man nods frightened

BLACK SUIT
Inshalla Inshalla

JAMES
Put your hands up

TRANSLATOR
He says he has a family

James kneels down to get a closer look at the bomb strapped
to the man’s belly He takes out his 9mm and puts it on the
guy’s forehead Cocks the trigger

JAMES
Look it would be a lot easier for
me to disarm this if I just shoot
you Do you understand
BLACK SUIT replies in Arabic

JAMES
(into walkie)
What is he saying

UPRANGE FROM SUICIDE BOMBER

TRANSLATOR
(over walkie)
He says I don’t wish to die I
have a family Please take this off
me

DOWNRANGE NEAR SUICIDE BOMBER
James holds his walkie up for the man to hear the translator

JAMES
(headset)
Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will be very happy to
shoot him

Translator conveys this to BLACK SUIT in Arabic BLACK SUIT
starts yelling in Arabic Forehead wet with sweat

TRANSLATOR
(over walkie)
He says please hurry he has a
family

JAMES
(to translator)
Look it’s not what I said Tell
him to put his hands behind his
head or I will shoot him

James holds the walkie up to the man’s ear “listen” “do you
understand”

Now James sinks to his knees and examines the bomb all the
while keeping his pistol on the man’s head There is a
FOREST OF WIRES He pushes them aside revealing a cheap
Casio digital WATCH which is counting down from five
minutes

lot of wires I need a little help

JAMES
Hold on let me think We got this

Sanborn nods His hand is starting to shake

James goes behind the man and rips open the back of his
shirt revealing the back of the bomb

Here too it is a welded band but the metal looks thinner
James works it with the cutter

ECU Casio Watch 130
JAMES
We don’t have enough time Sanborn
We don’t have enough time I have
to get these bolts off

The soldiers turn and run

James strains to clip the metal bar of the lock putting all
of his weight into the effort Finally the blades slices

ECU broken lock falls to the ground

James sees that he has four more locks more to cut The time
is ticking down to 20 seconds

James brings himself face-to-face with the man he can’t save
JAMES
I can’t There’s too many locks I
can’t do it I can’t get it off
I’m sorry

James drops the bolt cutter kneels down in front of the man
and shakes his head That’s it

The man understands James’ gesture He reaches forward
grabbing James’ suit

BLACK SUIT

No No Please

James brushes his hand away

JAMES
I’m sorry

James turns his back to the man and runs for cover
--James running arms akimbo

--The Black Suit man stands up and cries out to ALLAH
BOOM

flying at 22000 feet per second straight at us

ground

--Sanborn diving to keep the translator behind a barrier is
grazed by shrapnel

Were walking with James down a wide polished aisle past
shelves of frozen treats glistening behind reflective glass
in the shiny and perfectly sterile cathedral to consumerism
otherwise known as a supermarket

James looks different here awkward less sure of himself
With his hair grown-in and his dreamy expression he could be
just another suburban softy pushing a shopping cart
He’s home but this is clearly not where he lives
A beautiful young WOMAN approaches him from the other end of
the aisle She too is pushing a shopping cart and in it is a
small BOY She smiles at James and says
YOUNG WOMAN
Honey will you grab some cereal
and I’1ll meet you at the checkout

CONNIE JAMES smiles again and pats her husband on the
shoulder As she walks away he mumbles

JAMES
Where’s the cereal

But she’s already out of ear shot

CEREAL AISLE

James stares at the rows and rows of cereal boxes a medley
of different brands all containing the same sugar and
coloring and starch

He looks this way and that

Thrown by the abundant choices after the starkness of
Baghdad he can’t decide which brand is his

He reaches for a box then pulls back still unsure of
himself

Giving up he picks a box at random and tosses it into the
cart

The boy giggles and reaches up

On the bed is a Jack-In-the-Box which James picks up and
winds He opens the toy for his son who squeals with delight
eyes wide with admiration for his daddy Daddy however
isn’t sure where to go with thisAn odd moment for the wild-
man of Baghdad playing the awkward dad to his adoring child

James looks into his son’s unconditionally loving eyes
Something he sees there prompts a confession

JAMES
You love playing with that don’t
you You love all your stuffed
animals You love your Mommy your
Daddy You love your pajamas You
love everything don’t you

James playfully spins the mobile The boy laughs at the
whirring color

JAMES
But you know what buddy as you get
older some of the things that you
love might not seem so special
anymore You know Like your Jack-

The boy touches the Jack-in-the-Box smiling beautifully

Maybe you’ll realize it’s just a
piece of tin and a stuffed animal
And the older you get the fewer
things you really love
