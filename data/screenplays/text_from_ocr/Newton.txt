EXT SMALL TOWN STREET- DAY 1
A red dusty road in a mining town

A POLITICIAN in a white shirt and pants who looks more
like a local hood travels on top of a Jeep which has been
designed to look like a mythological chariot The jeep moves
through the market place

His 40 supporters are on 15 motorcycles bearing bandannas and
flags in his party color yellow They ride slowly in front
of the chariot shouting slogans

CHORUS
Humara neta kaisa ho Mangal Netam
jaisa ho Mangal Netam Zindabad

A couple of his supporters climb on the Jeep and garland him
He is already laden with a dozen garlands- all yellow
marigolds

His supporters gesture at everyone to listen to him speak
He addresses the crowd on a microphone

POLITICIAN
(in mock anger)
Mangal Netam aapke beech vote
Maangne nahi aaya hai Mat do mujhe
vote Mat do

His supporters are silent

POLITICIAN (CONTD)
Woh log mujhe thekedar kehte hai
Mujhe

(calms down)
Mujhe iss kshetra ka vikaas
chahiye Mera sapna hai ki har
bacche ke daaye haath mein laptop
aur baayein haath mein mobile ho
Aur woh log aapke aur vikaas ke
beech ka kaanta hai

His supporters start cheering him to not give up

POLITICIAN (CONTD)

(thumps his chest)
Magar yeh dharti ka poot aapke liye
khada hai Agar woh laal hai toh
main kamaal hoon Agar woh teer hai
toh main top hoon Isiliye main
kehta hoon ki agar aap iss chetra
ka vikaas chahte ho toh aapko pata
hai ki aapko kya karna hai

around which a fly is hovering and hands it to Newton When
Newton takes a sip a film of cream sticks to his lips

He cleans it awkwardly
Newton looks at Lila who looks uncomfortable
