SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL

BLACK SCREEN

MUSIC STRINGS Deep and dark Distant voices

EXT TRAIN YARD

A young man is walking along the tracks A slow aimless
walk Lost and lonely A setting sun at his back Hes
handsome in a rugged dangerous way Denim and leather
A great sadness and confusion on his face His name is

KEITH NELSON

DRUMS OBLITERATE THE STRINGS and we RETURN TO BLACK and
TITLES BEGIN

FADE IN

INT BEDROOM - GIRL
Shes playing drums to the TRACK Hard serious With
great purpose and need Shes boyish and tough Her
prettiness is intentionally buried beneath acres of atti-
tude This is WATTS DRUMMER GIRL

FADE TO BLACK
TITLES CONTINUE
FADE IN
INT BEDROOM - CLOSE - BOY AND GIRL
Beautiful girl handsome boy Perfection meets perfection
Making-out against the yellow slatted light of a darkened
bedroom Shes AMANDA JONES Hes HARDY JENNS
FADE TO BLACK
TITLES CONTINUE TO END
EXT TRACKS - TRAIN
A freight train is thundering down the tracks A HORN BLASTS

The speeding bulk dominates the FRAME The SOUND of DIESEL
ENGINES and CHATTERING TRACK obliterates the MUSIC

EXT TRACKS

The boy we saw before Keith Nelson continues down the track
He looks up

HIS POV

The train is bearing down on him
EXT TRACKS - ANOTHER ANGLE

BEHIND Keith TO SEE that hes walking into the approaching
train The HORN BLASTS AGAIN

CLOSEUP - KEITH

Watching the train No reaction A collision with the train
will only give him what he wants Change

HIS POV

The train shudders and rocks on the track The HORN BLASTS
AND HOLDS

CLOSEUP - KEITH
Still no change in expression
EXT TRACKS - KEITH AND THE TRAIN

FROM BEHIND Keith The train FILLS THE FRAME Its nearly
on him He steps out off the tracks at the last moment

EXT TRACKS - SIDING

Keith heads down the embankment as the train hurtles past
No change in expression

EXT LOWER MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - LATE AFTERNOON

The homes of working people Squat bungalows clean but
modest A black Corvette is parked in the driveway of one
of the houses It stands out among the more utilitarian
vehicles on the street An incongruent luxury A front
door opens and the boy and the girl we saw making-out in
the TITLE SEQUENCE step out of the house Her blouse is
untucked her hairs mussed stocking feet Shes flushed
and floating Hes in a hurry Done with her on to other
things She holds him back and kisses him Theres no
tenderness on his part Its one-sided

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - ACROSS THE STREET

Keith is across the street leaning on a lamp post His
gritty hands wrapped around the pole Washed but never
clean A hint of anger a touch of resentment Hardy
doesnt belong in the neighborhood Certainly doesnt de-
serve the girl

HIS POV

Hardy gets in his car fires the engine and backs out of
the driveway Amanda waves goodbye from the porch Hardy
drops the Corvette in gear and squeals away An irresis-â€”
table show of disrespect for the neighborhood

CLOSEUP - KEITH

Theres something tragic about his look Hardy has every-
thing money can buy and is now stealing the things it cant

HIS POV

Amanda goes back in the house

CLOSEUP - KEITH

His observation was careful and considered He looks at
his greasy hands Too dirty to touch her He pushes off
the pole
EXT ANOTHER BLOCK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

Maybe a little nicer than Amandas neighborhood But not

much Keith cuts across the freshly mown lawn up the drive-
way and around the back of the house

A tired two story in a modest neighborhood Clean but simple

INT KITCHE

Keiths mother CAROL is at a small built-in desk beneath

a wall phone balancing her checkbook Shes wearing nurses
whites She works Dinner is on the fire A ten-year-old
girl CINDY is sitting at the kitchen table Shes cata-
loguing her Garbage Pail kids in a photo album Keith comes
in the back door Cindy strikes

CINDY
Its Semi-Conscious Keith

Keith ignores her and continues through the kitchen Carol
addresses him without looking up

CAROL
Hi honey How was work

He exits into the dining room
CAROL
You still havent told me when

youre going to cut your hair

CINDY
Mom Youre flapping your lips
in vain Keith vacated

Carol addresses Cindy without looking up

CAROL
Speak English please

INT FOYER

calls to him from the living room

Keith stops at the bottom of the stairs He sighs Caught
He swings around and steps into the living room

INT LIVING ROOM

Keiths father CLIFF is sitting on the couch Spread out
before him are university brochures

CLOSEUP - KEITH

CLOSEUP - CLIFF

He speaks without looking at Keith

CLIFF

He looks up at Keith
CLOSEUP - KEITH
Plays it flat
KEITH

Arent you a little too old for

college
A thin smile breaks through
CLOSEUP - CLIFF
An incredulous stare Incredulous that Keith can be so
cavalier about a subject that Cliff considers vital press-
ing and overwhelmingly serious Theres no humor to his

retort

CLIFF
If Id gone to college I wouldnt
be selling tires six days a week

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He doesnt like hearing Cliff run himself down
CLOSEUP - CLIFF

A word of warning

CLIFF

If you dont get with the program
youll be selling tires too

(pause lightens-

up)
You want to take a minute and look
at these brochures A whole bunch
of new ones came in the mail today

(sorts through

stack finds one

holds it up)
Take a look Some of these are
real nice Look at this coed
physical education

CLOSEUP - KEITH
The last thing he wants to do

KEITH
Can I do it later

CLOSEUP - CLIFF
Hes been put off before
CLIFF

Im not trying to break your
back I just want you to get
off the dime and think about
your future

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He nods Hes heard it before

CLOSEUP - CLIFF

One last thought Whats really at the heart of the college
issue

CLIFF
You got a shot to be the first
guy in this family who didnt
have to wash his hands after a
days work

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He knows All too well He shows his hands to Cliff
Dirty Motor dirt Like Cliff said He pushes off the
door arch and heads back into the foyer He heads up the
stairs side-stepping the debris piled on the stairs to
be carried up at anyones convenience

INT KEITHS BEDROOM
Keith opens the door and stops cold
HIS POV

Keiths sister LAURA is sitting on the floor going through
his records LPs are out of their sleeves Shes rudely
holding an LP looking at the label

Keiths room is a shrine to art Its a serious shelter
from the outside world One wall is covered every inch
with reproduction posters art show posters art postcards
reproductions torn from books and magazines A collage of
the history of art A second wall is devoted to his own
sketches A third wall is a trompe loeil of an endless
marble gallery The fourth wall is hung with his own can-
vases A stereo carefully put together out of discarded
pieces and parts His bed is a mattress on the floor A
chair direct from the dump A rug from off a curb during
spring trash pick-up day A desk made of an old door held
up by two oil drums The surface is covered with sketches
and india ink pens and brushes ink bottles Clay and plas-
ter models and studies Everywhere are found objects
things intended for future pieces and studies It is an
artists studio in a boys bedroom Theres no question
from his surroundings that hes serious about his talent

LAURA
Im looking for that song about
the guy that killed himself for
the girl that hated his guts
She looks up
CLOSEUP - KEITH

Hes furious at the intrusion

CLOSEUP - LAURA

Disregards his anger

LAURA

your ass out the window

LAURA

(outraged)

arm to Carol

LAURA

wanted to sit out I couldnt
wear a bathing suit

CINDY
Exposing your skin to sunlight
will make you old before your

time
CLIFF
(to Laura)
You stay out of his room
(to Keith)

You got a problem with her see
me before you rough her up

KEITH
What right does she have to break
into my room And I didnt rough
her up

LAURA
I have practically no feeling
left in the upper part of my arm

CLIFF
Drop it

LAURA
I wish just once you guys could
experience the humiliation of
having the weirdest guy ina
huge school be a blood relative

CAROL
Your father said drop it

LAURA
This whole family revolves around

Keith Im sick of it

Keith sets down his fork and napkin

CAROL
Thats not true and you know it

KEITH
(to Carol)
Ill be upstairs

CAROL

KEITH
Excuse me

Keith gets up and exists Cliff calls after him

CLIFF
What about these colleges Keith
(pause)
I expect an answer

LAURA
Do you know what a total waste
of money its going to be
letting him go to college
Hell have this expensive
education that hell never use
because all he wants to do is
make incredibly ugly art that
wont ever look good in anybodys
house

Cliff Carol and Cindy stare at her

LAURA

KEITH

my life to prove that Im worth
