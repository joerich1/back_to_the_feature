their semen around the school as

unlikely

Oh it happens I’m sure much more than
we know

Bernard have you ever done something
like this

meaning but ultimately
unsophisticated bureaucrats

WALT

please the school

You said you wrote the song you played

Why

WALT
I don’t know

MR WADDLES
Did you have a reason

WALT
I felt I could’ve written it

MR WADDLES
Okay But you didn’t It was written
by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd I
think you know that

WALT
Yes but I felt I could’ve so the fact
that it was already written was kind
of a technicality

MR WADDLES
I see
(pause)
I can imagine this is a little
uncomfortable for you to talk about

WALT
I guess It’s hard to explain

Silence

MR WADDLES
I wonder how you’re feeling right now

WALT
I don’t know

MR WADDLES
I‘d like to know more about you Why
don’t you tell me about something less
uncomfortable A nice memory maybe

WALT
Isnt that kind of a stock question
for a shrink

MR WADDLES
Yes that’s more or less how this
works

WALT
I can’t think of anything right now

MR WADDLES
Just think

WALT
Come on

MR WADDLES
Just something Meet me half way

A silence as Walt thinks

WALT
Ummlet’s seeokay when I was
around six my Mom and Ishe and I
ducked out of Julie Glynn’s birthday
party to watch “Robin Hood” together
on our TV

Walt stops

MR WADDLES
That sounds like a nice memory

WALT
I liked Errol Flynn

MR WADDLES
Errol Flynn That’s all

WALT
And I was glad she let me leave the
party early to watch the movie She
and I loved that movie Its likewe
were pals thenwe’d do things
together we’d look at the knight
armor at the Met The scary fish at
the Natural History Museum I was
always afraid of the squid and whale
fighting I can only look at it with
my hands in front of my face When
wed get home after my bath she’d go
through all the different things we saw
that day in the museum And then we‘d
get to the squid and whale and shed
describe it for me which was still
scary but less scary and it was fun
It was fun to hear about it

MR WADDLES
Did your Dad live at home back then

WALT
Yeah why

MR WADDLES
You didn’t mention him Where was he
during all of this

WALT
He wasI don’t know exactly
Downstairs maybe He didn’t ever come
to the museumThis wasIt was
before my brother was
bornbeforeit was earlier

for a moment choked up He looks at Waddles

with a surprised expression on his face Waddles gives him
a “Not bad eh” shrug

emotional

FRANK (CONTD)

EXT HUNAN PALACE - DUSK 125

Walt looks in the window His gaze goes from family to
family sharing plates kids trying to eat with chopsticks
He finds Sophie and her parents at a table in the back He
watches for a beat She suddenly looks up and spots him
He awkwardly ducks behind a menu that’s pasted to the
glass He waits a moment and peers back out She’s still
staring He stares back too Her parents turn and look at
him A moment Walt ducks back He waits He peeks back
out but they’ re not paying attention He walks away

EXT PROSPECT PARK - DUSK 126

It‘s getting darker Walt runs along the path He
suddenly darts into the brush pushing his way through the

trees

He emerges to a pond No one is around He walks toward
it and stops He stares out over the water

INT BERNARD’S PEUGEOTEXT JOANS HOUSE - DUSK 127

Bernard sits in his car which is double parked Starts it
up changes his mind and puts it in park He sees Walt
running up the block Walt whose head is soaking wet
doesn’t see Bernard watching

Bernard waits for Walt to go inside Joans gets out of the
car and approaches the house He wades through the front
garden and crouches down to the basement window Inside
Frank shirtless sits on his bed with a beer Bernard
taps on the window Frank looks up startled

INT JOANS LIVING ROOM - DUSK 128

Walt walks in his hair and face wet Joan enters from the
kitchen Her face lights up and she goes to hug him but
backs off just before reaching him afraid of scaring him
off

JOAN
Chicken what happened
WALT
I dunked my head in that pond in the

park

JOAN
The one near the zoo
(he nods)
Sweety that’s filthy I hope you
didn’t drink any of it

Joan retrieves a towel from the bathroom and hands it to
Walt

WALT
Some may have got in my mouth I
tried not to swallow
(pause)
I shouldn’t’ve broken up with Sophie

JOAN
Why did you

WALT
I thought I could do better

JOAN
Better how

Walt gives this some thought His answer comes as a
surprise to him

WALT
I don’t know

JOAN
That‘s good you miss her

WALT
Yeah but I don’t see myself as a
person who is in this situation I
just don’t
You know I thought this could‘ve been
a real thing A real love affair I
don’t see myself this way

JOAN
Well this is how it is

WALT
Did you ever love Dad Cause if you
didn’t why did you ever marry him
If you were going to leave him why
did you put us all through this

JOAN
It wasn’t planned When we first met
he was unlike anyone In Columbus

there was no one like your Dad We
were on the Ohio State campus and wed
take our saiiRdhes out to the green
and picnic together JOAN (CONTD)

He asked me who I preferred Antonioni
or Fellini I said Antonioni which was
the right answer I guess at the
time

WALT
Is it Fellini now

JOAN
I don’t know I think it’s whoever
you like better

They make eye contact for a second

JOAN CONTD)
I had had an affair with a man before
your father He worked in the college
bookstore We used to make love in
the stock room It got so that the
smell of text books made me think of
him

WALT
Mom I don’t want to hear about your
affairs please

JOAN
I’m sorry I think I don’t know what
I can say to you

WALT
You have a way of saying things
sometimes that are a way I don’t want
to hear them Children shouldn’t hear
these things from their Moms You
should particularly watch it around
Frank

JOAN
I know chicken it’s something I do
It’s a bad habit

WALT
Do youdo you remember when we
watched “Robin Hood”

A moment Joan jumps” Walt startled turns Frank and
Bernard stand in the doorway

FRANK
He knocked on my window

JOAN
Bernard what are you doing

BERNARD
Joan let me ask you something All
that work I did at the end of our
marriage making dinners cleaning up
being more attentive It never was
going to make a difference was it
You were leaving no matter what

JOAN
You never made a dinner

BERNARD
I made burgers the time you had
pneumonia

JOAN
Only after I insisted

BERNARD
Well if I had made more dinners would
thatve made a difference

JOAN
I was ready to leave a long time ago
I just didn’t know it then

BERNARD
(hesitates)
I’ve been giving it some thought I
mean you called my father at the last
minute You said something Whatever
you said he thought I could save the
marriage

Bernard and Walt quickly meet eyes

BERNARD (CONTD)
You felt I wasn’t aggressive enough
I’ll make more of an effort to do
stuff I’ve been cooking and doing
chores at my house I make veal
cutlets which the boys love

Frank looks at his father as if to say “What are you
talking about”

BERNARD (CONT’D)
Why don’t we all have dinner and talk
more about this

Joan starts to laugh It catches her off guard It’s
clearly out of her control She tries to stop she sucks
it in but it erupts to a hysterical level The two boys
and Bernard watch her as she continues to shake and laugh
Nobody says anything Finally it dies down She wipes the
tears from her eyes Coughs She’s exhausted

JOAN
I‘m sorry It’s
justburgersonce

Joan loses it again laughing but struggles to control
herself Bernard sighs saddened by this But as it sinks
in he just grows angry

BERNARD

I’1l1 sue you Joan You know I will
You had an affair for four years with
that fucking shrink that ruined our
marriage and I can get the kids I
talked to Eddie Goodman who works on
these cases all the time and I have an
open and shut case

(pause)
Frank Walt get in the car

A pause

JOAN
Sue me That’s soI can’t You
only wanted joint custody cause you
pay less child support that way
Because it was cheaper for you

Joan stops herself She pounds the top of the TV with her
fist upset she said what she did Walt looks at his Dad
“Is this true” Bernard goes to the front door and opens
it Street noise enters the house

Walt the curb They both kneel down and look under the
vehicle The cat mews from beneath it Bernard reaches
under and grabs its tail He and Walt meet eyes underneath

rolled inside

BERNARD (CONTD)

asheans under the Golodners stoop

They meet eyes briefly He gives a “Who would’ve thought”
kind of shrug She nods Ivan and Walt climb into the
back with Bernard and the door is shut

bit stunned his face smeared from crying

moment removes a pillow off a gurney and brings it back
into the room Bernard awkwardly lifts his head and Walt
jams the pillow under his Dads neck Bernard tries not to
look at his sons crying he presses the nurse button a few
times but doesn’t seem convinced it’s working He finally
looks at Walt moved himself Bernard’s voice cracks as he
says
