The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant
shadows on the sea

A little boy around 8 years old —- tanned from head to toe

SPRINTS ALONG THE CLIFFS SCRAMBLES FROM ONE ROCK TO

another with amazing agility

In one hand he carries a transparent plastic bag In the
other a net bag containing flippers mask pants and
sweater

The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit -—-

obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big He tugs on them as
he goes holding them up Until they slide again as
he leaps again and pulls them up

The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL

End credits

EXT GREEK ISLAND — SUNSET

JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove

He spits in his mask expertly spreads the spit with a
finger locks his feet into the flippers and dives

He surfaces a long way out adjusts his mask and swims
away from shore

IN OPEN SEA

The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -—- sucks it
in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid
breaths -- almost hyperventilating almost alarming if
weve never seen this before

His gaze is glued to the ocean floor Clear clear water
40 feet deep And intensely blue

Suddenly he catches his breath and dives -- into the blue
UNDERWATER

JACQUES touches bottom Clamps his legs around a rock to
hold himself down Unhurried thoroughly at home 40 feet
under he opens the plastic bag A huge speckled moray
eel appears in a hole in the rock slithers toward him

The carnivores jaws are bigger than the boys head

The boy smiles at him Pulls a piece of raw meat out of
his bag and holds it out The eel takes the morsel

delicately -- and slithers back into his hole
Gravely JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag

JACQUES intent on the coins glimmer quickly slips on
his fins prepares his mask He swims in the water like a
fish goes directly to the coin Scoops it up brings it
to the surface

He breaks water waves the coin looks for the priest and
sees he is no longer there

JACQUES

a Dolphin

DISSOLVE TO
ON JACQUES —- UNDERWATER

to be watching him The surprise is such that JACQUES is
in a panic leaps up to the surface

A BURLY MAN around fifty crosses the room in the shadows
and throws open the shutters with a bang Sunlight pours

in He walks over to JACQUES bed in the one room house

and runs his hand through his hair

blankets on the floor on the other side of the room He
gives the pile a kick

top of his lungs)

of soup for Jacques A fifty year old man pokes his head
out from under the pile of blankets Its UNCLE LOUIS
who is having a very hard time waking up

EXT HOUSE —- DAY

JACQUES bursts out of the house running Diving gear
under his arm A piece of buttered bread in his mouth

He catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS Theyre on
a path winding down to the port JACQUES slows down
abruptly Tries to imitate their stride The weather is
balmy and the sea lies before them peaceful and blue
EXT SEA — DAY

Their boat on the water The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES
off the cliffs A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -—- skim
the waves of its wake

EXT BOAT — DAY

On board JACQUES Father checks the antique air pump
JACQUES polishes the enormous copper divers helmet and
lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea divers
suit

At the foot of an old monastery another boat passes

The Priest is in it

takes the gold coin out of his pocket

The pope nods to JACQUES His father looks over at him
without understanding The child quickly puts the coin
back in his pocket

EXT BOAT -— DAY

the kid with little round glasses is fishing He turns
around to the boat JACQUES smiles and waves at him

ENZO waves back obviously disturbed in his fishing session

FATHER

JACQUES helps his father into the divers suit The burly
man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes He seems
sluggish and tired JACQUES watches worriedly He has a
weird feeling

JACQUES
You shouldnt dive everyday Papa

UNCLE LOUIS

Jacques

His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck

FATHER
(winks at him)
Dont worry When Im tired down
there the mermaids help me out

Father and son smile at each other Then his father puts
the helmet on JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump

The heavy divers suit disappears slowly underwater The
gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of
sight

JACQUES and LOUIS work the pump Regular steady motions
to maintain the flow of air

UNCLE LOUIS
(to Jacques)

Hey Have you ever seen a mermaid

JACQUES
No

They keep on pumping for a while then

UNCLE LOUIS
Ive seen them

UNCLE LOUIS goes on JACQUES doesnt budge

UNCLE LOUIS
Dont you want to know where

JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father

He doesnt answer

UNDERWATER - JACQUES FATHER

He moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit He
is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor He
sees a sponge hooks it puts it in a bag thats attached

to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist He
moves on

INT BOAT — JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING
They keep up the rhythm Sitting on a rock at a distance

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
ENZO watches them UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff

UNCLE LOUIS
Why dont you ask me

JACQUES
What
UNCLE LOUIS
Where I saw the mermaids Why

Im always the one asking the
question Were sitting here like
two stones and Im taking to myself
Ask me something Goddamnit

JACQUES calmly looks over at him slows down his pumping
and almost serenely asks him

JACQUES
(in a completely
flat tone)

Why did my mother leave
UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question A beat

UNCLE LOUIS
(ill at ease)
Come on now pump

UNDERWATER -— JACQUES FATHER

He is walking with difficulty at the bottom His bag is
full of sponges He seems to be having trouble breathing

EXT BOAT -— JACQUES AND LOUIS

JACQUES and LOUIS are pumping silently UNCLE LOUIS feels
obliged to answer JACQUES question

UNCLE LOUIS finally breaks the silence and explains

UNCLE LOUIS
Your mother didnt leave She
went back to America thats all
Its her home Shes allergic to
this Island She likes
refrigerators and machines that
clean the floor so one day she
left Woman are like that
unpredictable like the sea

They havent been paying attention to the bubbles gushing
at the surface The air hose is being pulled down in a
very worrisome way

JACQUES

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
(with a slight grin)
So where did you see mermaids

UNCLE LOUIS smiles

UNCLE LOUIS
In the bars in Athens

Very pleased with himself UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing
JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders The air hose is

suddenly yanked down JACQUES immediately sees all the
bubbles He is white as a sheet

JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling
down at his father He grabs the life line and starts
pulling at it hysterically The air hose snaps and starts
flying around like some crazy snake JACQUES tries to
jump overboard UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot at
the last second JACQUES is slapping the water with his
hands trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS wont let him
JACQUES is yelling desperately ENZO is now standing on
his rock watching the scene horrified

The sea now looks as if it were boiling

UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his arms
Standing on his rock ENZO is now crying desperately

ENZO
(screaming)
Jacques Jacques

The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface it
looks as if they will never stop

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ITALIAN VILLAGE STREET — DAY
The image is now in color

A rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which
fills the screen

SUPERIMPOSED 1987 SICILY

ALFREDO runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he
can go surprisingly fast

He runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he
enters We have time to read the sign carrying the

restaurants name LA MAMMA

INT RESTAURANT -— DAY

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
ALFREDO skips in He is panting covered in sweat His
panic is palpable The whole room watches him approach a
long table where a large family is having a birthday party
for a very old lady

He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can
get the words out Then leans over and whispers in the
ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull
wearing little round glasses

The man listens then stiffens
EXT HARBOR -— CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
A beat-up FIAT towing an equally beat-up trailer stops

ENZO unfolds out of the drivers seat like a circus clown
emerging from a toy car

The construction SUPERVISOR an American wearing a three
piece suit hurries over to him

ENZO has already started undressing ROBERTO unloads the
diving gear from the trailer

SUPERVISOR
(exhausted)
Signore Molinari

ROBERTO
(shaking his hand)
Yes

ENZO
(calmly undressing
expressionless)
How did it happen

SUPERVISOR
(upset)
The company asked me to extract
everything I could from the wreck
so the divers were trying to get

at the engine and then the boat
turned over in the current
and look I fucked up Can you
help

ENZO

How many are down there
ENZO goes back to the car
SUPERVISOR

Just one Were feeding him air
but hes not breathing regularly

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Youve got to get him out fast
ENZO glances at the map then at the accident site
ENZO

(a beat)
Ten thousand

SUPERVISOR
Lira

ENZO
Dollars

SUPERVISOR

Youre going to hold me up at a
time like this

ROBERTO
You do understand youre talking
to the champion diver of the world

SUPERVISOR
Yes but ten thousand dollars

ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack

He slams the trunk shut and stands looking at the American
straight in the eyes

ENZO
Okay You tell me How much would
you say the mans life is worth

Extremely uncomfortable the SUPERVISOR doesnt answer

ENZO
In my village we have a saying
when the wind blows the flags of
all nations flap in the same
direction

SUPERVISOR
(baffled)
What does that mean
ROBERTO
That you should get your checkbook
Damn quick
EXT UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO
Hes at the end of the pier his feet dangling in the muddy
water of the port A few feet away a pump sends air HISSING
through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below

ENZO inhales steadily his chest heaving like a bellow

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes dons
his flippers etc with his usual flair of suspense

Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers
watch expectantly ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the
bay a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the
pier

ENZO ignoring everyone grabs the ordinary tire jack flip-
flops over to the now taut cable the stone has hit bottom
He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay

UNDERWATER — WRECK
ENZO dives down a chimney of muck Picks his way over and

around every hazard until he reaches the diver trapped
under a huge piece of debris

He pats his shoulder to comfort him he then inserts the
tire jack under a piece of concrete And as if he were
changing a tire begins to pump the handle

Slowly in a swirl of mud and water the chunk of debris
rises off the divers leg

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE —- DAY
Everyone is staring at the water silently suspensefully
The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand but has completely
forgotten it intent upon whats going on underwater
ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder
ROBERTO

Since we have a little time what

do you say you write that check
UNDERWATER — WRECK
ENZO cuts the cables tangled around the divers torso
Then he takes off his flippers plants his bare feet on
the concrete grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls

him free

The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as
possible toward the surface

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

The diver surfaces gasping for breath A cheer goes up

from the crowd Several men hurry to pull him onto dry
land But there is no sign of ENZO Everyone waits
breathless

ROBERTO

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
(to the Supervisor)
Sign here

Suddenly ENZO appears burst out of the water holding
his flippers up in the air like a trophy The onlookers
cheer help him out of the water slapping him on the back

ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO

Impassive and silent he slips his arms into the prize
fighters robe that ROBERTO holds out for him walks
solemnly back to his car

ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car ENZO
bends down into the car and opens the roof

SUPERVISOR
(through the open
roof smiling)
Thanks thanks a lot I mean that
too You extortionist bastard

The car rushes off In the distance we see a police
(carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the
direction of the construction site

INSIDE FIAT —- DRIVING AWAY

ENZOS car drives past them ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of
the corner of his eye then suddenly explodes with joy

ENZO

Dollars Roberto We took him for

ten thousand dollars
ROBERTO whoops and whistles ENZO reaches over and leans
on the horn The little car races by and finally stops at
the top of the cliff facing the sea
EXT TOP OF CLIFF — DAY
The two brothers sit back relax

Stare out to sea

ROBERTO
(after a while)
Enzo what are you going to do
with the money

ENZO
Have the car painted

ROBERTO
Santini will do that for 25 dollars

ENZO

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Then tell him to wax it too

ROBERTO

ENZO
(thinking)

A rosary for Mama a dress for
ANGELICA SOMETHING WITH RHINE-

stones for whats her name and get yourself a suit that
fits But most important

ROBERTO
Yes

ENZO
Find the Frenchman Find me Mayol

EXT FLAKES OF SNOW —- MOUNTAINS - DAY

Mountain peaks stark and white A winter sky which is
strangely and disquietingly dark A landscape swept by
snow

SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN PERU — LAKE HUACRACOCHA — MAY 1987

A yellow light comes out of the storm —- advances toward
us The headlight of a train

A narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of
snow in front of it

INT TRAIN -— DAY

Sitting in the train leaning against the misty window
JOHANA CROSS 27 has clear quick charm and a sort of
romantic fragility She is dressed simply but warmly

She looks through the window all she sees is white

It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this
trip Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book
she calls upon an old Peruvian

JOHANA
(in Spanish)
Is this the Lago del Demonio
(Es bien aqui el
Lago del Demonio)
Huacracocha

The old man goes into a long rambling explanation
JOHANA nods without understanding a thing

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
JOHANA
Gracias

OLD MAN
You welcome

EXT TRAIN STATION — DAY

The train pulls in slowly pushing piles of snow in front
of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which
serves as the station

A man FRANK bundled in a parka comes out of a snowmobile
parked by the station and walks up to the train

JOHANA steps down carrying her suitcase and drops two
feet in the snow as she comes off the last step FRANK
walks over and leans down towards her

FRANK
(smiling)
Welcome to Peru

INT SNOWMOBILE - DAY

FRANK throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile
jumps in and turns the ignition on JOHANA takes her hat
scarf and gloves off FRANK glances over at her he is
both amused and charmed

JOHANA
Dont you have a heater

FRANK
(hitting at the
dashboard)
Yeah Sure Is this your first
trip to Peru

JOHANA
Does anybody live to make a second

FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system then leans over
to check it his eyes off the road

JOHANA
(a little worried)
Forget about the heater

EXT LAKE OF THE DEMON -— CAMP — DAY

The storm is at its peak The frozen snowmobile plows
along side the lake HUACRACOCHA and stops in front of a
cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow

FRANK gets the bags out of the back The suitcases are by

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
now frozen stiff JOHANA follows in his steps

A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt
to protect themselves from the storm

JOHANA is bewildered Shacks in the middle of the Andes
the lake of the Demon and now llama that have to be
pushed aside to enter ones home

As FRANK opens the door a man is leaving the hut The
man is JACQUES MAYOL JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other
in slow motion Everything seems suddenly suspended time
sound cold

JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her He is
now 34 still dark-haired with dark eyes He is wearing
a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles He looks

like some legendary creature one would dream about

Everything finally regains its formal speed The door
slams the man is gone She and FRANK are in the middle

of the entrance hall JOHANA hasnt yet gotten over the
vision she has just had but she regains composure and
enters the next room

INT QUONSET HUT

JOHANA happily takes her gloves off

FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room

Its a sort of laboratory filled with ultra modern
equipment

A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a
long wooden dock

Sitting in a corner an old Peruvian man is preparing hot
drinks JOHANA drops into a chair

FRAN
A drink to warm up
JOHANA
Yes thank you Intravenous if
possible
FRAN
(pulling out a flask)
Tea or whiskey
JOHANA
both Did I just see a man in

a red suit and goggles
FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
FRANK

(calling out)
Dr Lawrence The insurance man
uh The insurance person is here

LAWRENCE
Its about time

FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea She warms her
hands on the cup She asks blankly

JOHANA
Would it be out of place to ask
what hes doing

FRANK
Who

JOHANA
The guy in the Halloween suit

LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room
He walks straight over to the bay window

LAWRENCE
Did you have a nice trip We were
getting restless its been three
weeks since the accident

JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at
something in the distance

EXT DOCK -— ON JACQUES

At the end of the dock JACQUES who is sitting on the edge
of a hole which is cut in the ice is putting a pair of
gloves on He then grabs the handles of a strange machine
which emerges from the water and starts taking deep breaths
oblivious to the cold his mind completely elsewhere

BACK IN LAB
JOHANA watches JACQUES She just
cant believe her eyes

LAWRENCE is bent over one of his machines fiddling with
different switches

LAWRENCE
(to Johana)
You should get things moving you

JOHANA is finally able to speak

JOHANA

LAWRENCE
Mayol Jacques Mayol

JOHANA

guy into a frozen lake

LAWRENCE turns one last knob

LAWRENCE
The truck fell into a very
deep crevasse We werent able to
save the equipment

JOHANA
Ill have to talk to the driver

LAWRENCE
In the spring when he melts

JOHANA walks closer to the window She isnt hearing a
thing hes saying

JACQUES is putting on his flippers
JOHANA cant believe it

JACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice He is holding
onto the machine in the water He is waving a mask

JOHANA
(dumbfounded)

You really send him under the ice

He isnt a slave or a convict or anything

LAWRENCE
My dear science is a cruel
mistress
JOHANA
But how is he going to breathe
LAWRENCE

He isnt going to breathe
JACQUES takes a deep breath turns a handle and a weight
yanks him straight down into the water LAWRENCE sets his

stop watch off and flips a few switches

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
JOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about
it
LAWRENCE

Listen

He raises the volume we hear the mans heartbeat through
a small speaker

LAWRENCE
Thats his heartbeat
(excited)
Can you hear the speed at which
its slowing down its incredible

LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures
on it and hands it to JOHANA

JOHANA feels shes on the verge of crying and cant figure
it out

UNDERWATER -— JACQUES

JACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles

Hes deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake He swims
deliberately carefully into a large tube which is hinged
open He closes it around himself His heart is still

slowing down He pushes a button on the machine and a
flash of light bursts in the opaque night surrounding him

BACK IN LAB - ON VIDEO SCREEN

We see a moving X-ray image

LAWRENCE
Hes in the fluoroscope now Listen
to his heart Impressive huh

The flow of blood is concentrated
in the brain and doesnt even feed

the limbs anymore Its a phenomena
that has only been observed with
dolphins until now

JOHANA
How long can he stay down Without
breathing

LAWRENCE
It depends He should come up
soon

(smiling)

Unless hes decided to stay for
the night

JOHANA

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Why is he doing this

LAWRENCE
For one thing its his job as
for the rest of it I wish I knew

JOHANA sighs with relief as JACQUES appears at the surface
in one big breath

JOHANA
Shouldnt somebody take hima
blanket or something

LAWRENCE
(smiling at Frank)
Coffee might be nice

She heads towards the Old Peruvian and pours a cup of
coffee

JOHANA
(afterthought )
Will he understand Spanish

LAWRENCE
His mothers an American He spent
half of his life in the states
Id try English if I were you

EXT DOCK -—- JACQUES SURFACING

Hes groggy half hypnotized He looks up at the dock
sees JOHANA with a cup of coffee He stares at her She
hands him the coffee

JACQUES
(puzzled)
I recognize you

JOHANA
We saw each other a little while
ago
JACQUES
(serious)

In the lake

JOHANA
(wondering whether
he is joking or
not)
No in the hut

After a long beat

JACQUES
(with a beautiful

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
smile)
Then it was somebody that looked a
lot like you Thank you

JACQUES then turns around and walks toward the huts

JOHANA still hasnt moved as if petrified by her emotions
and the severe cold She then walks up to the hole in the
ice and peers into the dark water She shudders

INT CABIN — DAWN

JOHANA emerges from a down sleeping bag Shes wearing a
big sweater and a wool hat She is not sleeping

Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile she gets up and
walks over to the frozen window JACQUES and FRANK are
loading their luggage onto the snowmobile

Outside LAWRENCE is saying Goodbye to JACQUES Unseen
JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain JACQUES senses
something he turns around toward the cabin and smiles
waving his hand at JOHANA She hides behind the curtain
and shyly waves back

JACQUES gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the
frame We are left with an endless array of snow-caped
mountains

Beethoven was always a favorite of his

JACQUES very tipsy by now walks over a glass in each
hand He hands ENZO a glass then takes off his tennis
shoes and sits them neatly on the piano

ENZO
There is nothing like music It
speaks from the heart Can you

the dark the cold without ever
taking the time to breathe Huh
Can you tell me why we do it

JACQUES nods

ENZO

champagne bottles around

They are both quite drunk ENZO is philosophizing
JOHANA is looking for them

ENZO
- So between Mamma Roberto and
the sisters we yell and scream
all day long Except with Angelica
She just cries And then finally
we all end up kissing Can you
explain that to me

JACQUES cant answer

ENZO
Because thats what love is all
about Its a pain in the ass but

keeps us together
(then in a half
dreaming half
desperate tone)

A large and beautiful family

JOHANA walks over to them

JACQUES
The size of the lungs has nothing

ENZO is getting really angry The drinks have a lot to do
with it

JACQUES

JACQUES
Im sick of never feeling at home

JOHANA takes him in her arms He breaks down

INT YACHT - DOCTORS CABIN - DAY
A medic is bending over ENZO taking his blood pressure

ROBERTO pulls the tuxedo jacket down The doctor puts a
blood pressure band around ENZOS upper arm pumps it up

He listens with his stethoscope

DOCTOR
Mr Molinari Im terribly sorry
but I cannot allow you to dive in
such an advanced state of
exhaustion

ENZO jumps to his feet grabs the doctor by his lapels
lifts him in the air

ENZO

(outraged)
What do you know about the sea
Huh Nothing So you just put
your tubes and tin cans away The
sea is mine I know when she is
ready for me and when she isnt
And today she is ready
Understand

DOCTOR
You dive at your own risk Youre

ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder

ENZO
Brave

EXT YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM

Its a large float rigged to the stern of the Committee
Boat ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim

ladder to the platform Hes wearing a wet suit and fins

He flip-flops to the end of the platform

ROBERTO hands him his mask The goggles are filled with

polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible

Only two pinholes to see through The mask fits tightly
over his nose When ENZO puts it on he looks like an
astonished insect ENZO breathes faster and faster

ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving
apparatus ENZO crosses himself takes a last long gulp

of air

ROBERTO releases the weight It sinks and drags ENZO down
he quickly disappears into the dark water

BLACK AND WHITE
But this is JACQUES as he was a
child He swims along the bottom
finds and picks up a gold coin
We can see its ancient markings a
youth on a dolphin

JACQUES looks up In front of him is a dolphin floating
vertically still apparently just watching JACQUES isnt
scared anymore But every time he swims toward the dolphin
it moves further away It finally disappears

INT HOTEL ROOM — JACQUES - DAY

He sits bolt upright in bed awakened by his dream He
looks around the room trying to get his bearings

JOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room On the wall
behind her her last nights dress is drying on a hanger

Shes wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep

JACQUES finally awake from his dream sees JOHANA sleeping
He walks over to her touches her shoulder

She wakes up starts out of the chair She grabs the
blanket to cover herself and in doing so a book falls on
the floor Its one of his

JOHANA
You scared me

JACQUES picks up the book JOHANA smiles

JOHANA
Just checking up on your family
(then embarrassed)
I guess I was drunker than I thought

hotel in a wet dress Well

oversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater She seems quite
pleased with her new attire

JACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and
head toward the dolphin pool Its pretty crowded mostly
kids

The dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the
pool The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool
and getting absolutely no reaction

JACQUES
Whats the matter

TRAINER

JACQUES is staring at the female dolphin It looks like
the animal is trying to tell him something Suddenly the
dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the
pool

JACQUES hangs onto the dolphins muzzle Lets it pull

him along The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool
and pulls JACQUES to the bottom The other dolphins circle
above

EXT DOLPHIN POOL - DAY

JACQUES pops up As he does three dolphins leap in the
air behind him JOHANA walks closer to the pool She is
so excited by what JACQUES is doing she finally falls
into the pool

After a while JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps JOHANA
out

TRAINER
Did you ever think of trying the
public pool

JOHANA
Hes a dolphin specialist

TRAINER

new one Is she sick or not

JACQUES
(taking his time to
answer)
Not the way you mean

TRAINER

EXT SEA — DAY

The sun is rising on a rough sea The Committee Boat is
anchored in the open sea 600 feet above the sea bed

EXT COMMITTEE BOAT - BAY OF TAORMINA — DAY

JACQUES who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just
laid a towel down before him Hes suited up sitting in

THE LOTUS POSITION STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD CLEARLY SELF-

HYPNOTIZED

JOHANA NOVELLI and other officials are in the stern of
the boat watching last minute preparations

The scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and aqualungs
flop out onto the diving platform plunge into the water
disappear

JOHANA
What are they for

NOVELLI
Theyre paramedics They wait at
180 feet

JOHANA

(just checking)
If there was a problem they could

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
do something right

NOVELLI
Of course thats what theyre
for

JOHANA sees scuba divers with weird air tanks

JOHANA
(pointing)
And those

NOVELLI
Those are the divers who go down
300 to 330 feet They dive with a
Helium-oxygen mixture At that
depth compressed air is too
dangerous because it contains carbon
dioxide

JOHANA
Whats that little air bottle on
the machine

NOVELLI
That isnt for the divers actually
Its for the balloon It blows up
and pulls the diver up like an
elevator Without it with the
pressure at the bottom the diver
would just stay pinned to the sea

bed
JOHANA
(shocked)
But doesnt Jacques dive without
anything
NOVELLI
(smiling)
Yes Its magic

INT BOAT — DAY — LATER

On the boat NOVELLI checks his watch JACQUES comes out
of his room Hes dressed to dive He ignores everyone
as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform He
seems to be in another world All sounds coming to him
are drowned out

EXT DIVING PLATFORM —- DAY
JACQUES sits in the divers slot Opens his eyes slowly
and looks around He puts his flippers on an assistant

stands at his side

HIS POV

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
The figures on the platform are vague the VOICES are
GARBLED and incomprehensible Moving almost in slow motion
he raises three fingers

TECHNICIAN
Tre minuti

BACK TO SCENE
Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive

They disappear one by one into the blue

JACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask He puts
them in and now his view of the world is as distorted as
his hearing bodies deform sounds fade

Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his
system he moves into another reality altogether seems
to empty himself out

TECHNICIAN
Due minuti

JACQUES fills a small tube with water Pours it into his

nostrils tilts his head then lets it run out He
puts on his gloves all his movements are slow he seems
to be operating in a different time zone He seems unable

to take his eyes off the water
EXT END OF DIVING PLATFORM — DAY

TECHNICIAN
Uno minuto

JACQUES puts his nose clip on He puts his hand on the
gueuse Closes his eyes and inhales slowly Then he takes
a sudden last breath nods the technician releases the
gueuse and in one flashing movement he disappears

UNDERWATER
The gueuse slides down the cable
JACQUES hangs on like a ribbon in
the wind past a marker 90 feet
down

Above him the boat disappears from sight

He moves faster and faster through a sea that looks
like a cloudy sky The light fades rapidly around him

Below white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night

JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds Turns the
brakes brings his machine to a halt 180 feet down

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
The medics are waiting for him there They take his pulse
Check his eyes 15 seconds normal the bubbles from
there scuba tanks churn the water around them

JACQUES closes his eyes a tap on the shoulder he
releases the brake on the gueuse Plunges further this
time into pitch black

Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom He reaches
it and the dark diver moves to him JACQUES brakes his
machine Moving very slowly turns his body right side

up Like a sleep walker JACQUES starts to take the plaque
off the plumbline pauses in the middle of the gesture

The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES thumb and
forefinger touching fingers extended all clear JACQUES
does not respond The diver repeats the signal JACQUES
does not respond

The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder a beat and
then JACQUES responds thumb and forefinger touching okay

Slowly reluctantly he wraps his hand around the handle
of the balloon

The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him The
balloon inflates JACQUES hangs on lets it carry him

up

At the plague marking 210 feet JACQUES lets go of the the
balloon With a burst of speed it darts toward the

surface

JACQUES follows slowly undulating like a fish Hes
getting warm now He closes his eyes

Passes the medical control without stopping without

even seeing it like someone asleep

Hes moving faster now toward the warmth toward the air

JACQUES opens his eyes watches the lights grow brighter

The silhouette of the boat comes back into view 60 feet
to go

EXT DIVING PLATFORM —- DAY

In slow motion JACQUES hand holding the plaque breaks out
of the water followed by his arm in one continuous
movement his shoulders and head

He gasps for air

A trickle of blood comes from his nose

Flashbulbs flicker spectators cheer

EXT OPEN SEA —- A DOLPHIN

The dolphin the one rescued last night leaps into the
air in perfect harmony with JACQUES triumph

EXT DOLPHINARIUM

The dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the
exact same moment

The trainer doesnt understand whats going on
EXT DIVING PLATFORM —- DAY

JACQUES falls back into the water Two divers run over
and pull him up onto the dock

JACQUES seems completely dazed almost in a trance He
slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder

It is the scream of his body in need of the surface reality
and the feel of the land

JOHANA is terrified She can hardly breathe Everybody
applauds

EXT HOTEL DOCK —- DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA walk down the gangway NOVELLI has
lead the way and the news has been spread

JACQUES looks very weak and punchy
JOHANA holds him up

The spectators applaud as he goes by Intrigued JACQUES
looks at them all

JOHANA
(excited)
Jacques listen to the applause

He doesnt respond

JOHANA

the mouth JACQUES is a little stunned

EXT TERRACE -— SWIMMING POOL —- DAY

can tell he knows that JACQUES has beaten his record He

deliberately puts on a huge smile as he walks over to them

INT HOTEL ROOM — JACQUES -—- JOHANA — TWILIGHT

Theyre in bed making love in their fashion Moonlight
shines in the silver sea In the background are the lights
of the bay of TAORMINA

LATER
JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA
They are both asleep

Suddenly he sits up as he always does after his recurrent
dream

Hes wide awake looks over at her sleeping She sleeps
peacefully like a baby Quietly gently he eases out of
bed and walks to the open window

He stands on the balcony staring at the sea Then in the
distance in the moonlight a dolphin leaps out of the water
once twice a third time

JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down
next to JOHANA She is still sound asleep

EXT HOTEL — PIER -— NIGHT

JACQUES quickly gets into one of his diving suits He
puts on his flippers The dolphin is still jumping in and
out of the water JACQUES jumps off the pier and swims
over to her

INT JACQUES HOTEL ROOM — NIGHT

JOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep

JACQUES absence wakes her

JOHANA
Jacques

She gets up and walks over to the balcony She doesnt
see anything

EXT PIER — NIGHT

JOHANA walks down the pier and notices the little pile of
clothes JACQUES has left behind She looks around but
still cant see anything She decides to sit next to the
pile of clothes and waits her eyes riveted to the sea
EXT PIER — DAWN

The sky has just begun to light up again JOHANA is still

sitting next to the pile of clothes

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
She is wearing JACQUES sweater She looks sad yet serene
The look of a woman who has been thinking over the situation
and who has made up her mind

Tired JACQUES swims back to the pier It looks as if he
has come out of nowhere

He is exhausted He takes off his flippers and gets up
onto the pier in front of JOHANA He looks at her a little
surprised to find her there

JACQUES
(warm)
What are you doing here

She answers in a far away voice with the same serene
sadness

JOHANA
Im going to leave Jacques

Dripping with water he sits down next to her His face
is drawn from fatigue She continues

JOHANA
Im going back home

JACQUES
Why

JOHANA
Because one shouldnt fall in love
with creatures from the sea

JACQUES
Im not from the sea I dont
understand what youre talking
about

JOHANA
Yes you do You know exactly what

Im talking about Youre afraid
I want to hold onto you and I do
but youre not ready at least
not for me

JACQUES
But its not true I feel good

She looks at him for a moment then takes his face in her
hands and rests it on her bosom as if a small child

The diving capsule suspended by cables begins its descent
through a trap door in the deck It plunges into the sea

The three men in the capsule are JACQUES ENZO and the
tough looking CAPSULE COMMANDER NOIREUTER who is much too

professional for ENZOS tastes

ENZO watches through a porthole while the COMMANDER

concentrates on the control console He runs through a
checklist of systems JACQUES responds with a check as
he verifies each one ENZO is already bored and fed up by

the procedures
JACQUES is lost in thought they dont look cheerful

ENZO
(suddenly)
You still thinking about her

JACQUES doesnt answer ENZO goes on

ENZO
Dont think about her anymore
Let me tell you youre just making
yourself unhappy There are so
many women in the world

He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and
stares at NOIREUTER

ENZO
Plenty of women everywhere right

NOIREUTER
(coldly)
Smoking is absolutely forbidden

ENZO

Then NOIREUTER blows up
NOIREUTER
(in a panic)

(loosing his temper)
Hey Dyou have any other

there and you decide that you
will die for them Only then do

love you have for them If its

audience

NOVELLI
Now Im sure youve heard that

some people have suggested it is

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
too dangerous for us to continue
Dangerous because we dont know
how to measure the physiological
consequences of this type of dive
and also because the scuba divers
are not used to going down below
300 feet

While the attentive crowd listens to NOVELLI ENZO is
gesturing to ROBERTO explaining what appetizers he wants
from the cocktail trays

The crowd laughs

NOVELLI
But we polled the free divers and
they insist that the competition
continue

Theres wild applause ENZO lifts the trophy over his
head smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone

ENZO
(yelling)
Good luck to you all

ENZO smiles

The Tahitian comes out of the water in a semi-coma The
doctors carry him away Once hes sure that the diver is
out of danger ENZO smiles again

A whole team of Japanese walk over to the diving platform

The team consists of one diver and six assistants three

of them playing music to help the diver concentrate The
diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his
forehead He is concentrating very hard so much that

ENZO walks over to him to make sure hes okay The Japanese
diver concentrates with such strength that he faints

He rolls over and watches her sleep looking down at her
adoringly He slips off the chain with the gold coin

Slowly holding the chain he runs the coin gently over

her body stops at the level of her stomach and lets it
rest there She opens her eyes and looks at him wondering
if he senses something

JOHANA
(softly)
What are you doing

JACQUES
Im putting you on the coin
Your essence That way youll

always be with me when I dive

She smiles closes her eyes He swings the coin over her
face gently some kind of private ceremony She looks
just a little intimidated

The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth She
hesitates then opens her mouth JACQUES lets the coin slide
into it

just below the diver who swims over to him in a sea of
bubbles from his oxygen bottles He asks JACQUES if he is
alright JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before
swimming off downwards

The diver realizes and starts after him He grabs JACQUES
by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round platform

Below them a small boat passes In it are baskets filled
with sponges JACQUES stares at them for a long time

JOHANA
Do you ever sometimes just stop
and think how sweet life can be

A beat

JACQUES
Sure

JOHANA wants to say something

JOHANA
When you dive with that
machine What does it feel like
JACQUES
(after thinking
about it)
The feeling of slipping without
falling The hardest is once you

are at the bottom

JOHANA
Why

JACQUES
Because you have to find a good
reason to come back up again
And I always have a hard time
finding one
JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost

JACQUES doesnt notice

ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them starts to
play staring at the sea

JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him
ENZO
(smiling)
You should start playing the

refreshing it clears the sinuses

serious concentrating hard

LAWRENCES boat slides along the big Committee Boat and
the DOCTOR climbs onto it

NT COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE -— NOVELLI - OTHERS

LAWRENCES briefcase is open Theres a stack of graph
paper on a cabin table

LAWRENCE
When I analyzed the data from
Mayols last dive it became
apparent
(taps the graph
paper )
At the depths these men are
diving it is a physiological
impossibility that they can retain
enough oxygen in their blood to
make it back to the surface Its
a function of how long it takes to
get to the bottom orient themselves

and to return To attempt to
break Mayols record is simple
suicide

(to Novelli)
For the last time Im telling
you cancel the competition

NOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform
where ENZO is concentrating

MEDIC
Molinaris a seventeen time world
champion Do you want to tell him

(no response)
Enzo its important

ENZO opens one eye

ENZO

JACQUES
(quickly)
We cant dive anymore They want
to cancel the competition fora

while
ENZO looks at him coldly Takes another deep breath

JACQUES
(rushing on)
Its not safe they say The
doctors say it isnt possible to
go deeper and live Free diving
is over as a sport

ENZO
You say that because you have the
title
JACQUES
No I would never cheat you
ENZO

Well thats very nice of you

He takes a last breath signs himself and reaching for the
gueuse disappears into the water

LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving NOVELLI is balling
out his assistants

were a gaggle of geese He listens to the sound of the

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
gueuse playing out watches the depth indicator the
stopwatches He knows something is wrong

He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little oxygen
bottle which is there for security He takes a few breaths
of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives down
after ENZO

UNDERWATER — JACQUES
JACQUES pulls himself down the cable hand over hand

80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming toward
him carrying ENZOS unconscious body

JACQUES struggles with them pushes them away takes ENZO
in his arms and climbs toward the surface frantic
screaming silently at him desperate to get away from the
flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks the commotion
the memory of death

ENZO has a big serene smile on his face The MEDICS push
both divers toward the surface

As if they were on land JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to
wake him up He then slaps his face but ENZO remains
unconscious

They finally break the surface in each others arms

EXT ON DIVING PLATFORM

They pull ENZO out of the water The doctors open his
jacket ENZO motions to JACQUES to come close He still
has that long smile

ENZO
(faintly)
You were right

JACQUES

I was right about what
ENZO
(after a long silence)
It is much better down there
Its a better place
He tries to take a deep breath the effort is exhausting

Push me back in the water

JACQUES

JACQUES puts his head down on his friends chest and sobs

The doctors gently try to move him away but JACQUES

resists
LAWRENCE
Just give him five minutes What
does it matter now anyway Come

on just leave him alone
LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform

JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his
belt Before anybody can stop him JACQUES rolls ENZOS
body back into the water and dives after it

UNDERWATER -— JACQUES

He holds ENZO in his arms Lets the dead weight of the

body pull him down deeper and deeper The rope around
JACQUES waist runs out stops his descent with an abrupt
jerk When he feels it JACQUES lets go watches as
ENZOS body continues to drift by itself into the bottomless
blue

EXT DIVING PLATFORM

The doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that

JACQUES is attached to He is unconscious when they pull
him up They hold him up by his feet JACQUES throws up
gallons of water They put an oxygen mask on his face

S BREATHING LOUDLY AS IF TIRED OUT FROM HIS POV THE

room becomes very dark and blue The noise is unbearable

The ceiling turns into water

JACQUES eyes are wide open His face is sweating The
water level from the ceiling comes down to him until he
is swallowed by it

As he falls into the water we see a dolphin gulping air
at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue

The dolphin meets his group about ten of them 250 Kg of
muscles swimming at more than 40 kmH underwater They
all break through the surface to gulp air regularly

Suddenly one of them leaves the group He crosses the
blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds We see a sonar
picture Its an image in which the dolphin will appear a
few seconds later The dolphin comes up like a rocket
gulps air and goes back down

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
The sonar image appears again Finally the dolphin
locates a group of fish and starts hunting them exactly
like a war plane He manages to break the group in two
then in four and this way he isolates his victim

He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down He

goes full power The fish he is after are even more
divided There is only one left totally lost and ina
panic

The exhausted fish is swallowed

The dolphin slows down goes back up breaks the surface
in slow motion Images becomes pale and bright

He screams inhumanly

Image is white black silence

at the sea

JOHANA
(after a while)
I lied to keep you here
She kisses him
JOHANA

Promise me one thing

JACQUES
Anything

JOHANA
Promise you wont forget me

She pulls the line releasing the gueuse

JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse
disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by the ocean

UNDERWATER
JACQUES slides along the cable pulled by the weight of
the gueuse He has a beautiful smile on his face He is

in his element Night has closed in around him He turns

on the headlight of the gueuse it casts a dim light around
him

EXT DIVING PLATFORM — NIGHT

JOHANA has walked over to the edge of the platform She
is holding the cable to hear JACQUES descent

The counter shows that JACQUES is quickly passing the 300
feet mark

UNDERWATER

JACQUES keeps going down as serene as ever He has gained
a lot of speed

EXT DIVING PLATFORM — NIGHT

JOHANA holds her face in her hands The counter indicates
that JACQUES is going very fast

UNDERWATER

The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable JACQUES
turns his body right side up

EXT DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT
The counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet

JOHANA has felt the jolt of the cable She cries her tears
and looks down at the water

UNDERWATER

The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet
around JACQUES as if he were standing in a circle of light
He stays there patiently floating around and around his

cable as if he were waiting for something

A long form circles the border between the darkness and
the light

JACQUES holds out his hand A dolphin comes and presses
its body against it Two other dolphins come out of the

night JACQUES watches in amazement

A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES hand ready to lead
him off JACQUES hesitates

JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away

Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night

THE END
