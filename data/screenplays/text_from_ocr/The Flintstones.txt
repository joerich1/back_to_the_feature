FRED FLINTSTONE archetypical Everyman sits atop his
faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur cranking the winch
that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry
wall

wrist sundial And its magic time quittin time

Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle
bird and yanks its tail The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of
the workday --

FRED
YABBA DABBA DO --
Fred happily discards his hard hat leaps out of the
canvas-roofed cab on the dinos back slides down the
tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and
timber car He gets up to a running start with the only
motor (his feet) slows to allow a time clock dinosaur
to punch his stone timecard and then hes trotting back
up to speed and out of the gate MUSIC comes UP and

reading FLINTSTONE We WIDEN as Fred SKIDS to a halt
in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave A
moment later WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking
just like they should -- and get into the car A beat
behind them are the Flintstone pets Dino and the
saber-toothed cat
Fred pauses looks around HONKS his HORN BARNEY
BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house hop

DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - DUSK

Fred and company pull in He takes a giant sea shell
speaker off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his
car door He leans over puts his arm around Wilma
(In the back seat Dino pops his head up tearing through
the canvas top) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and
puts them on his head for a better view CAMERA ZOOMS IN

And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL we --

DISSOLVE TO
AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN

Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants Giant
DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro Bubbles rise from
a still pond and weird lungfish move onto the land
(The third one out carries a little suitcase)

CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore With a
DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING we DISCOVER a set of strange
hideous clawprints The CAMERA FOLLOWS these then
WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints A seven-
foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus

It looks around menacingly (Oddly its carrying a
canvas sack but we dont stress this)

Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs
over the Xenosaurus

NEW ANGLE 7

Dazed the Xenosaurus gets up As it does we realize
that we arent deep in some primeval forest but on the
shoulder of a gravel highway A stone road sign reads
BEDROCK 12 MILE ROCK VEGAS BABYLON and EDEN NEXT THREE
EXITS Now the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and
we see -- Bedrock

7
Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape the charming
protosuburbia gleams in the dawns early Spielberg light

The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills
out Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight

WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK 8

It reaches the crest of a hill where theres a WELCOME
TO BEDROCK billboard which bears greetings from the
Rotary Club the Chamber of Commerce and (of course)
The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes The garbage truck
guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and
trot over the rise coast down to the street below

The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops and
the rear guys hop off One of them waves to --

A MILKMAN 9
who returns the wave then takes a four-pack of stone
bottles out of his milk truck heads towards a doorway

As the milkman drops off the milk he passes a big

TORTOISE with trash cans on its back The Tortoise

nods familiarly to the milkman then it waddles down the
curb CAMERA FOLLOWING The garbage men take the cans

off the Tortoises back dump them into the truck

REAR OF TRUCK 10
-- revealing that the back of the truck is actually a
giant-jawed CREATURE strapped onto the chassis The

garbage men dump the cans into its maw it happily
swallows the works licks its lips BELCHES
BACK TO SCENE 11

The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise who

winces as they drive off
TORTOISE
(under his breath)
You can forget about a tip for
Christmas

It waddles back up the lawn passing by a wooden lawn
timer box which now pops open

Inside the box is a ROOSTERSAURUS which CROWS and flaps
its wings The motion of the wings knocks loose two

round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube
Goldberg

FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES 12
They reach the ends of their respective paths dislodging

a stick that releases a coiled rope which in turn

spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth As

it begins to spin around it squirts water out of its

snout

Elsewhere on the lawn other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat
this performance After a moment they gradually slow
their revolutions The one closest to the house
scrunches its trunk with a GROAN

LITTLE MAMMOTH
(sotto)
Oh my aching sinuses

INT FLINTSTONES BEDROOM - DAY 13

WIDEN FROM the windowsill where a little sea shell
hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO into the ear of a CLOCK RADIO
WOODPECKER The Woodpecker yawns gets out of bed
puts a timecard in a little clock Then it turns

and begins pecking on a BELL which RINGS PIERCINGLY

INT BEDROOM - NEW ANGLE 14
Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes One is a

great SNORING bulge the other is a svelte and lithe

shape As the BELL continues RINGING the larger bulge
GRUNTS MOANS pulls a pillow over its head and then
finally gropes under the bed for a slipper The slipper

is thrown without aiming --

THE WOODPECKER 15
ducks just in time It wipes its forehead nervously

RADIO WOODPECKER
(sotto)

I hate this job Theres not
even a health plan

He staggers back up to his perch and then notices for

the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not

to ALARM but to ALARM and RADIO The WOODPECKER SIGHS
looks over at the bed where SNORING is still emanating

Then the bird swings a little telescope around to point

out the window

WOODPECKERS TELESCOPE - IRIS SHOT 16

as the SCOPE PANS and FOCUSES finally SETTLING ON a
distant stone building marked RADIO STATION B-ROK

16
Perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey
and an octopus The monkey holds up cue cards which the
octopus reads and then waves nautical semaphore flags
BACK TO SCENE 17
Our WOODPECKER squints CLEARS his THROAT
RADIO WOODPECKER
(deeper on-air voice)
Good morning Bedrock This is
station B-R-O-K with the morning
weather and news
IN THE BED 18

The big bulge GRUNTS and MUTTERS a bit then one hand
gropes around finds the curvaceous form under the
neighboring covers feels it tentatively then
the fingers walk upwards
RADIO WOODPECKER (0S)

It will be fair and mild through

the weekend continuing for the

next eight hundred years followed

by cooling breezes and a protracted

ice age
Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the
covers now they pull them down revealing the owners
face the face of Fred his eyes at half-mast his
face covered in fashionable Bedrock Vice stubble

FRED
(with genuine charm)

Wil-ma Wil-ma How about a

great big good morning kiss for

your Freddy-weddy
And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO who is

immediately YI-YI-YI-YI-ING hopping all over the bed
and showering Fred with sloppy kisses
FRED
Dino Dino cut it out --

RADIO WOODPECKER (0S)
In the news Bedrock civic and
business leaders met yesterday to
discuss the growing kibble crisis
(MORE)

RADIO WOODPECKER (0S) (CONTD)
Ecological activist Ralph Naderock
warned that if new supplies of
kibble are not found our animal-
powered civilization itself may be
threatened

By now Dinos affection attack has knocked both master
and pet to the floor in a jumble of bedclothes asses
and elbows Dino begins to roll Fred across the room
like a seal playing with a ball

FRED
Dino thats enough -- here look
Daddy has a nice dino bone for
you just please stop it --

Fred has now backed up to a dresser where he grabs a
brightly-colored box labeled PURINROCK DINO TREATS

Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs eager for
the treat -- Fred shakes the box alas nothing comes
out

DINO YI-YIS again propelling Fred into the next room
INT FLINTSTONE KITCHEN - DAY
Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and
Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion
Wilma turns at the noise One look at her and we under-
stand Freds romantic turn

In other news Bedrock police

intruder was sighted in the

Bedrock Hills for the third time

WILMA
Fred stop playing with Dino and
sit down Your breakfasts
getting cold

Saying this Wilma puts a huge egg at Freds place
Meanwhile Fred manages to get to his feet holds out
one arm to keep Dino at bay Fred does a big take
looking out the window --

( )

19
FRED
(throwing open the
door)
Oooh Dino look -- theres a
nice big dino bone laying out on
the front lawn --
Pause Dino gives him a big look as if to say Oh

yeah
FRED
(trying again)
-- Gosh look at that adorable
little female dino --

yYT-YI-YI-YI DINO is out the door like a rocket Fred
cackles slams it shut then sits down at the table
FRED
-- That animals gonna kill me
with kindness Do you know were
out of dino treats
WILMA
So is everybody else in Bedrock
That kibble crisis is getting
worse every day
She puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster Two
claw-like devices hold the toast pulling it out of
sight
WILMA
Im afraid Dinos going to have to
manage on leftovers from Pebbles
and me

FRED
(sitting down)
And whats wrong with my leftovers

WILMA
Ill let you know when I see
some

RADIO WOODPECKER (0S)
(finishing up)
Scientists from BC
University report that the
footprints of the Xenosaurus match

PEBBLES
Mommy is the bad Ze-ze-zenosaurus
gonna get me and eat me up
WILMA
Of course not baby

FRED
Thats right sweetheart The
only thing thats gonna eat you
up is -- me

And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her
PEBBLES
(giggling calming)
Im still a little scared
FRED
Pebbles dont worry These
stories are very exaggerated
Like you know the boogyman
Theres no such thing as a huge
inhuman reptile that attacks
without warning --
WHAM Dino reappears bounding through the window
and knocking Fred onto the floor Once again Dino is
happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously
unresponsive owner Fred struggles to avoid the
slurping tongue pulls himself up to the window sill
looks out
FRED
-- Oh look everybody the mailman
is here --

yI-YI-YI-YI DINO buys it again runs to the door
lets himself out This time Fred puts a chair against
the door

Meanwhile Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER
POPPING UP We see that the claws we saw earlier were
the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit
who is tucked inside the toaster As Wilma takes the
toast the Lobster blows on his claws wincing then
looks TOWARDS the CAMERA
LOBSTER
Well it beats working ina
seafood restaurant

FRED
(taking the toast)
Thanks Wilma
Fred slaps jelly on the toast takes a big bite and then
something outside the window catches his eye

HIS POV - STREET

A paperboy on a wood-and-stone bicycle is coming rapidly
towards the house In the bikes basket is a stack of
dried rock-hard clay tablets

BACK TO SCENE

Fred leans out the window waving his hands

FRED
Arnold Arnold Dont aim at
the house -- please not at the

house --
WHAM Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams
into the window frame SMASHING a FLOWERPOT taking out
a chunk of wall and continuing diagonally through the
kitchen and out another window Fred follows this
action in time to see --
HIS DRIVEWAY - THROUGH THE OTHER WINDOW
The rock paper drops like a foul shot rips through the
canvas roof of Freds car and then bangs a huge dent
in the hood

BACK TO SCENE
Fred sighs turns back to his breakfast

WILMA
Lucky it wasnt the Sunday paper

FRED
(slight smile)

Yeah What else can go wrong

He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing
a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps knocking Fred
over as it takes off through the window

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FLINTSTONE DRIVEWAY - LATER 24
Fred -- now dressed for work -- is forlornly trying to
fix his car

In the neighboring driveway Wilma and Betty pile the
kids into Bettys car

BETTY
(wiping their mouths)
Come on kids Time for nursery
school

PEBBLES
Bye-bye Daddy

FRED
Bye little sweetheart
(as Wilma clears
her throat)
Bye big sweetheart

Fred kisses them both and they drive off Fred sighs
tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to
stitch Nearby Dino struggles to drag the stone news-
paper inside the house The twin headlines are of
course KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS
STRIKES AGAIN

Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge As its
mouth opens and closes it appears to be talking but
the voice is that of --

BARNEY

Nice morning huh Fred

FRED

Whats nice about it

BARNEY
Heh hey That Arnolds got a
real arm on him dont he

Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingos stiff

legs which he scissors making the birds beak trim the

hedge

FRED
This is the third ragtop this year
say shouldnt you be at work

BARNEY
Ah well that appliance store and
me we kinda had a little
adjustment --

FRED

BARNEY
Fred dont start on me again I

You invented fire
BARNEY

coal conglomerate ripped me off
The case is still in court but
meanwhile I got lotsa other
ideas --

FRED
Yeah but did any one of them
ever put bread on the table How
long are you and Betty gonna live
on those penny-ante royalties you
get

Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges

examines it with dismay

FRED
If you ask me pal youre just
blowing smoke up your own
volcano

BARNEY
Maybe Fred But first

He uses the flamingos jaws to snatch the car hood
from Freds surprised grasp
BARNEY
Let me try some of that smoke on
your car

INT BARNEYS GARAGEWORKSHOP - DAY 25
We can still see Freds car in the neighboring driveway

(We can also see Dino who drags the newspaper on a

bit more then collapses from exhaustion)

Barneys garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and

ends plus various inventions and scale models in

different stages of completion (Interestingly a

number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vincis work)

Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green
material

Fred watches skeptical as Barney presses the car hood
into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone
BARNEY
(as he works)
-- See the first step we make
a mold of the old car hood smooth
out the dent in the clay --
He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash
Then moving rapidly he starts heaving a variety of
ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood

BARNEY
-- Add some lava granules some
woca leaves juice from two

coo-coo berries

FRED
(impressed)
Two coo-coo berries You made of
money Barney

BARNEY

Anything for a pal Fred -- a

lump of coal bamboo sawdust

eucalyptus sap a touch of the

La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila
Barney dips a finger in this mess tastes it
satisfied he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock
weight slams down on the whole mess making Fred jump out
of his skin

NEW ANGLE 26

Fred is caked with dust He coughs and spits
FRED
Barney why dont you try inventing
a brain for yourself Look at what
you did to --
( )

26
He stops as Barney cranks up the weight on a ratchet
proudly lifts out a perfect (though greenish) duplicate
of the car hood As Fred examines it impressed despite
himself we
CUT TO

BETTYS CAR - TRAVELING 27
The two kids are in the back seat Somehow both of the
kids faces are messy again Working together with
beautiful precision they are carefully dismantling the
rear armrests and door handles
BETTY
(in mid-speech
driving)
Oh its not that Im complaining
Wilma I mean Barneys sweet but
well hes just not cut out to punch
a clock And hes such a dreamer
you think he ever once picked up a
hammer and chisel and tried to
balance a checkbook
They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little
nursery school MRS GRANITE a pleasant-looking 65 sees
them from the schoolyard waves while Wilma and Betty un-
load the kids
BETTY
No Barney just keeps looking for
that coo-coo berry pie in the sky
and I dont want to pop his balloon
by talking about the price of

mastodon ribs

She wipes off Bam-Bams mouth with a handkerchief Wilma
does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids
who immediately run into the schoolyard

MRS GRANITE
(approaching)
Mrs Rubble Mrs Flintstone I
wanted to thank you personally

BETTY
Youre welcome Mrs Granite But
we wipe their mouths every day

MRS GRANITE
No no I mean for all your wonderful
support the past few years Its
parents like you that make me think
twice about retiring

27
From the schoolyard comes the sudden sound of KIDS QUAR-
RELING and then a THUD and some CRYING

MRS GRANITE
On the other hand

Wilma and Betty laugh

WILMA
Were really going to miss you
too Mrs Granite

MRS GRANITE
Have you found another school for
the children

BETTY
Were still shopping around
WILMA
Fortunately were both --
Wilma and Betty straighten salute

WILMA and BETTY

routine before)
-- Professional shoppers

EXT BEDROCK STREET - TRAVELLING - DAY
Fred and Barney drive along (Behind them the same
houses and palms seem to be going by duplex palm

split level

Barney grins

He takes his

two palms duplex palm)
gestures towards the front of the car

BARNEY
Not bad eh After it cures for an
hour or so its solid as a rock

FRED
Okay you fixed a dented hood But

Barney looks

FRED

-- youre not a clock-punching guy
-- but face it Barney -- its time
to grow up and put your nose to the
grindstone batten down the hatches
and join the ratasaurus race with
the rest of us

(meaningfully)
Its time to retire those dreams
glum doesnt say anything Suddenly Fred

pulls over stops the car
FRED
Barney Look
WIDE SHOT 29
Theyre at the crest of a high wide hill

BARNEY
Hey Lava Lane

FRED
Remember the old days Barn We
used to race our go-carts here to
impress the girls

BARNEY
(wistful)
Yeah those were the days we
usta dream about coming back here
some day with a real car and goin
for the goldrock

A look from one to another and then down the hill
Fred gets a malicious grin on his face

29
BARNEY
Fred I thought you said it was
time to retire those old dreams
FRED
Hey Since when do I have to be
consistent

The two pals laugh and then with a whoop they begin

pedalling like mad They go over the top gravity takes

over and they are flying past that billboard with all the
Rotary Club welcomes on it But now we see a different

sort of welcome as a POLICE CAR ZOOMS out from behind it
POLICE CAR - CLOSER 30

Inside are SERGEANT FELDSPAR and his rookie partner
OFFICER GRAVEL Cackling with anticipation Feldspar
opens a box marked radar detector Out pops a little
bird in a police helmet It has a stopwatch (actually
stop-sundial) around its neck Feldspar points -- the
bird salutes -- takes off
FRED AND BARNEY 31
BARNEY
(spotting the cops)
Oh-oh Fred slow down --

Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying
alongside them It checks its stopwatch writes a note
to itself Fred is so preoccupied he doesnt notice

as --

THE POLICE CAR
cuts in front of Fred Fred SLAMS on the BRAKES sits
helplessly as Feldspar gets out walks over grinning

FELDSPAR
Well Flintstone looks like todays
the day

FRED
Sergeant Feldspar I I wasnt
speeding honest

Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks
ANGLE ON FLOORBOARD

Theres a box there marked RADAR BUSTER

FELDSPAR (0S)
Forget it Flintstone This time
I got you dead to rights --
Fred opens the box A scary-looking winged reptile
sticks out its head smacks its hungry lips

BACK TO SCENE

Confident Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird
turns to his rookie partner

FELDSPAR
Gravel Get me the radar reading
and Ill show you how we deal with
scofflaws

Gravel nods steps towards the bird The bird checks
its stopwatch and then it notices the flying lizard
which is hovering nearby licking its lips
RADAR BIRD
Whoa Wings do your stuff --

The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour
leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind
Feldspar catches the watch startled

FRED

Well Sergeant if you dont have

a radar reading I guess well --
(quickly)

A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away
FELDSPAR

to their legal spot a big limousine is parked in a no

space now drops a stone coin in a parking meter

Inside the window we see a LITTLE BIRD It bites the
coin to check it then turns over an egg timer

EXT QUARRY - MOVING SHOT 47
Fred and Barney cross the busy lot sidestepping workers

and animals Fred does a lot of backslapping waving
Barneys filling out the forms on the move Behind them

we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the
quarrys sides

Hearing a loud SMASH Fred looks up and sees --

FREDS POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR 48
A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN he grins in-
side his dino-topping cupola winds his winch handles and
then propels his wrecking ball towards the

QUARRY WALL - ABOVE 49
-- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts
balanced on a boulder
WIDER 50

Piltdowns compact buddy PYRITE cackles sweeps up the
walnuts Munching them he balances a new one in place
(It should be noted here that the relationship and physi-
cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors that of
our heroes theyre sort of an anti-Fred and Barney)

PYRITE
Way ta go Pilty baby Five bucks
says you cant hit one on the fly

PILTDOWN
(calling up)
Yer on Pyrite --
Pyrite tosses a walnut which bounces on the ledge The
wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall
BELOW 51

Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down
People grab for their construction helmets
FRED
Not again
Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to
the level of Piltdowns cab Barney hurries to follow

FRED
All right Piltdown thats enough
Youre endangering your fellow

workers
PILTDOWN
Yeah Sez who
FRED
Says me Fred Flintstone -- shop

steward of Amalgamated Neolithic
Workers 101

PILTDOWN
Yeah Well ANW one-oh-one gives
us workers a snack break So
(a nasty grin)
Im breakin some snacks

He swings the wrecking ball again

UP ABOVE 52
This time hes overdone it The wrecking ball flies past
the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks for cover -- and then the

wrecking ball whips over and around the handrail which
runs along here twisting as tightly as Indiana Jones
whip The handrail wobbles dangerously in its
foundation --

PILTDOWNS DINO 53
SNORTS backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin
to CREAK and GROAN with the strain --

WIDER 54
Workers scatter fearful of the imminent collapse Fred
runs to grab the dinos reins

FRED
Whoa whoa big fella --
He calms the beast by giving it a carrot As it munches
Fred quickly ties the reins to a post
FRED

(calling up to the cab)
Youre on report Piltdown If its
up to me youll be pushing a
wheelbarrow

PILTDOWN
(leaping down)
Youve been asking for this

Flintstone Im gonna kick your
fat butt --
FRED
Fat butt Hold me back Barney --
(sotto very sincere)

-- Barney hold me back --
Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred
Barney looks up and sees --
THE CRANE ON THE DINOS BACK 55

It is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down

BACK TO SCENE 56
BARNEY
Hey maybe you guys oughta fix
that first
PILTDOWN
Why should we

56

BARNEY
It looks dangerous Besides you
can kick Freds fat butt anytime
FRED
Yeah Thats right
(realizing a glare
at Barney)
I mean -- this aint over Piltdown
(turning shouting)
Come on guys Lets clean up the
mess
With much grumbling ropes and grappling hooks are
gathered and the crew hops to it

INT SLATES OFFICE - SAME TIME 57
Slate stands in a blubbering fury as Lava mops coffee up
from the model and Slates face
SLATE
Bankrupt Are you crazy

Lava holds up a clay tablet covered with figures
LAVA
Its all here in hack and slice
When you committed to this housing
development the price of dino kibble
was a few clams per ton Since then
its gone up a hundredfold
(indicating the model)

You cant build a project like this

without the heavy equipment dinos
and we cant afford to feed those
dinos

Slate glowers paces around the model
SLATE
Im two months behind schedule my
options running out on the land
and Donald Trumprock is just waiting
to jump in and steal the whole deal
meanwhile that damn unions on
my back hell theyll probably want
an eighty hour week or something
(frustrated)
Theres got to be an answer

A LOUD COMMOTION outside the window attracts everyones
attention

( )

SLATE
Whats that
LAVA
(worried)
Sounds like a workers comp claim
if I ever heard one
All rush to the window They look out and see --
THE QUARRY - WIDE
Supervised by Fred all the workers are straining on the
ropes to haul the rear legs of the crane back into their
sockets on the back of the big dino Only the last
critical rope is still dangling
FRED
Barney Grab that line Hurry

Barney scrambles up Freds back shoving a foot in Freds
face but finally snatching the rope He pulls on it
Fred throws his own weight into the effort

THE CRANE

THUDS into place on the dinos back -- the workers cheer --
THE WRECKING BALL

alas with its cable now twisted shorter its become an
immovable object and as the shortened CABLE SNAPS the
wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall

NEW ANGLE

Men and ANIMALS YELP and dive out of the way as the BALL
rolls downwards SMASHING everything in its path
EXT SLATES OFFICE WINDOW

The executives watch concerned as --
THE WRECKING BALL

tumbles down down knocking scaffolding and ladders
aside reaches the end of a ramp and drops through the
air right onto --

THE HOOD OF FREDS CAR

-- where astonishingly the HOOD sinks in resiliently
like a trampoline and then with a loud SPROING the
wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air
followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself
Both hurtle TOWARDS the CAMERA --

SLATE AND EXECUTIVES
react fearfully as they realize all this is coming
straight for them With a howl they all dive aside --

INT SLATES OFFICE - WIDER - DAY

The wrecking BALL flies through the window SLAMS onto
Slates desk crushing everything in its path and then
sails on SMASHING right into --

THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT

-- where all of the lined up HIGH RISES SMASH ASIDE with
a sound like falling pins
IN THE QUARRY

The workers pick themselves up and now their eyes follow
the path taken by the long-gone wrecking ball
FRED
Oh boy Goodbye pension fund --
They rush for the office building

INT SLATES OFFICE - DAY
Dust is still settling The staff rises from the mess
coughing Lava rummages in the debris finds a stiff

body
LAVA
Uncle Uncle speak to me --
But its only a statue of a golfer from one of Slates
trophies
SLATE
(sitting up)
Im over here you moron -- and
dont call me Uncle

Slates eyes fall on Freds car hood swinging from a
bookshelf He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays

put and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster
which reburies him At the same time the door slams

open and Fred Barney and the other workers tumble inside

THEIR POV - OFFICE
As they take in the destruction Barney notices the
wrecking ball amidst the model buildings As we watch
the last remaining little HIGH RISE FALLS

BARNEY
Hey nice going Fred You even
got the spare --

FRED
Barney shut up --

(turning)

Mr Slate -- Mr Slate -- are you
all right

Slate staggers to his feet seething with fury He
finally yanks the car hood free It bounces and VIBRATES
in his hands like a hand saw
SLATE
(eying the men)
For five years Slate Construction
has had the finest safety record
in Bedrock
(pacing angry)
Our workers are trained in first
aid our equipment is first rate
and our dinos are worm free And
then something like this happens
I want to know how
A cacophony of voices starts to answer
SLATE
Shut up
(in the sudden silence)

I want one person to answer me
(waving the car hood)
Whos responsible for this
PILTDOWN

nudges the wrecking ball off the edge of the table It
falls on Freds foot Fred starts to scream and Piltdown
shoves a pencil holder into his mouth

PILTDOWN
(quickly)
It was Flintstone Mr Slate

PYRITE
Thats right Mr Slate it was
Flintstone

BARNEY

Thats a lie Mr Slate

SLATE
Who are you

BARNEY

B Rubble White male personal

to say to you --
Fred cringes Piltdown and Pyrite smirk

SLATE

Congratulations

FRED PILTDOWN
Huh What

This stuff you had on your car is
the most incredible building
material Ive seen in thirty years
in the construction business

(testing it)
Its strong --

(twirling it)

-- Light --
(bending it)
-- Resilient --
It rebounds SPROINGING him on the chin He recovers

shakes it off

SLATE
Where on earth did you get it

FRED
Oh its ah just something I
whipped up in the old garage
workshop --
(quickly)
-- with a little help from my
buddy Barney right Barn

BARNEY
Well actually Fred it was the
other way ar--
Fred hisses between his teeth repeats the Slate and me
are just like this gesture he made earlier points at
Slate 71
BARNEY
(reluctant)
Sure Fred right right
Slate nods distracted his eyes and hands running over
the smooth lines of the car hood

SLATE
The rest of you men go back to work
want to talk to Flintstone and
the personal reference alone Come
on move move
They go out Piltdown looking furious

SLATE

Light as a Pterodactyl feather

costs in half in quarters in

Eighths --

-- Barney what do I call it
BARNEY

(Etc)
Slate takes the piece of material leans it on the table
so it catches the light Despite himself Lava comes
over examines the car hood cant help but marvel at
it as well Meanwhile Slate puts his arms around Fred
and Barney

SLATE
(to Lava)
You see this Lava All those

BARNEY
Gee thanks Mr Slate
Lava glowers Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with
genuine excitement

FRED
Just be thankful I was there to go
over the fine print

(full of himself)

Its like I told you this morning
-- Theres something noble about a
man digging in with his hands and
doing an honest days work Once
you file those dreams under old
business and put your nose to the
plow well the world is your
oyster And was I right

BARNEY
No Fred you werent I didnt
nose any grindstones and you didnt
shoulder a wheel We just hung out

and said go bowling right now

WILMA
Betty sometimes youre a little
too gullible --
BETTY

believe what I did today

WILMA

(indicating the forms)

Do you have any idea of what the
enrollment fee is And get this
its non-refundable --

BETTY

stand that womans attitude But
we had to find a new school anyway
and there we were the next thing
I knew I was in over my head
but why did you jump in too

WILMA
Oh she was getting to me too with
all that mastodon snort about her

BETTY

WILMA
And if a friend cant help you

Betty smiles touched Then reality intrudes again
BETTY
What do we tell the boys

WILMA
Whats wrong with the truth

We put ourselves in debt so the
kids can attend school with a

Attention fellow Water Buffaloes
INT WATER BUFFALO LODGE - NIGHT

The members are milling about the main room schmoozing
drinking kibitzing All wear the furry and horned
ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo

One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge
coat of arms (with the motto Ackus Ackus Adackus below)
a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various
bowling trophies balls and pins At the lectern the
HERDMASTER (a mustachioed inspirational type) bangs
again for order
HERDMASTER
Brothers your attention

It quiets a bit He clears his throat raises his chin
and gives a strange mournful bellow

The herd is now called to the

The entire Lodge dutifully imitates this gesture

Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies he
immediately leaps to his feet paws the ground and gives
an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmasters earlier
call to order

BACK TO SCENE 80
After the CRY ECHOES away

the poisoned water hole Fred moves towards the podium

as the noise dies down

Barney moves to the wall where he pulls a rolled up
tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant He tacks it
to the wall yanks a string It unrolls Its a big
VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE poster

Barney turns gives Fred a thumbs up and as he does
Barneys hand brushes against a folded parchment in his
pocket Barney pushes his way through the seats catches
up to Fred and hands him the document Fred takes it
continues up to the podium There the Herdmaster hands
Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler crossed over each
other like a Pharaohs badges of office

Fred does a Papal-like wave with these sets them down
and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him
FRED
(reading at first
wooden then
confident)
Brother Buffaloes honored
Herdmaster Junior Bucks and
Apprentice Antlers a great good
evening to you all Ahem As you

They both duck down behind the wheel A moment later
Feldspars patrol car comes barrelling by

Feldspar looks every which way doesnt spot them

106 MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

Now accompanied by heroic “industrial-type MUSIC we
see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation

This cannot be described now with appropriate justice
but it involves a series of animal-powered conveyor
belts Rube Goldberg-like funnels spouts and chutes
and all sorts of gadgets gizmos bells and whistles
to wit

106

At one end of the building dino-powered dumpsters and
lifters drop off all the ingredients these get stomped
chewedbashed and otherwise reduced to powder which is
then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with
water into a foam which bubbles through a long sawmill-
type trough and is held back by a gate

Meanwhile we see a sample item (in this case a stone
sofa) as it is placed before two goatasauruses which
butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of

a clay mold When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed
aside Barney appears and personally aims the foam
trough at a funnel in the top of the mold Pausing to
taste the mix he smiles then shouts --

BARNEY
Ready aim fibre
Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough Fibrefoam

pours into the mold
THE CLAY MOLD

gets winched unpwards by monkeys and then an alliga-
torsaurus whaps it with its tail

BELOW

Presto A Fibrerock copy of the stone sofa drops neatly
out of the mold bounces lightly on the conveyor belt
below It sparkles with the tell-tale celadon-green
shimmer of Fibrerock As it chugs along the process
repeats and soon a score of identical sofas is in view

END OF ASSEMBLY LINE

as a beaming Fred watches workers easily stack the
Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed) Nearby we see
Fibrerock window frames doors chairs etc

UP ANGLE - SLATES OFFICE BALCONY

Slate and Lava watch the progress dollar signs in their
eyes

DISSOLVE TO
LONG MATTE SHOT - SLATE QUARRY - LATE AFTERNOON

Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere stretching
away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kanes
warehouse

We see everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock
table lamps to Fibrerock toilets MUSIC OUT

CLOSER - QUARRY YARD 112
Fred and Barney weary approach each other shake hands
as they view the days incredible output Other weary
but proud workers gather around them Mr Slate is about
to address them from his office balcony

They cheer Slates remarks pat Fred on the back
114 BACK TO SCENE 114

SLATE

No longer will man and beast bend

under the backbreaking load of

stone and rock and timber

because Fibrerock is so light

that even a child can handle it

heavy equipment operators 15

shaft diggers and 22 laborers

INT SLATES OFFICE - DAY

Slate is practicing hitting golf balls into an automatic
putting cup Lava and some office workers are checking

a blueprint against a model of Slate City which is made
out of Fibrerock A ball shoots back at Slate who tees

up again

INSIDE THE PUTTING CUP
A little MOUSE in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch
the ball Stopping it with his little hockey stick the
Mouse gasps raises its hockey mask
MOUSE
Whew And its still pre-season
He whaps the ball to Slate again

BACK TO SCENE

Slate tees up the ball again Fred barges in banging
the door Startled Slate drives the ball instead of
putting it It sails across the room and SHATTERS a
PICTURE of Mrs Slate

SLATE

SLATE
Of course I can Fred I can lay
them off like --
(snapping fingers)

and-wing with the putter
SLATE

FRED
(bravura slipping)
Oh you can huh
LAVA
Of course he can Flintstone
Its his quarry
SLATE
(still calm warm)
Thats right Why --
(chuckling)
I could lock the front door and go
fishing if I wanted

Lava laughs along with the office staff and Slate Fred
chuckles a little to fit in

118 SLATE
(winking)
Why I could even fire Lava here
if I wanted
Lava quivers with mock surprise Everyone really laughs

now

SLATE
Or
(wiping away a tear)

FRED

(guffawing)
Me Ah ha thats rich Mr
Slate thats --
Suddenly Fred stops laughing

SLATE
Flintstone Lava here

of public relations to get
Fibrerock off to a good start
Im a member of that public
Flintstone and I have to say
this isnt a good start Im

Fibrerock A bad feeling about

FRED
Uh well gee I uh yeah

show Most importantly the routine includes the

following
A) Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop
( )

B) The kids tie down a jump rope and Dino does a wire
walk
C) And finally Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto

his back culminating in a big ta-da after they all

The room ECHOES with MOOSE-LIKE SNORTS

HERDMASTER
All for Flintstone bellow now

Fred snorts sounding like Herb Alperts lonely bull
Even under his furry fez we see him looking around
desperately hoping to hear one more snort
He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades
away finally as Fred squirms miserably there is one
more lonely snort
from Barney of course
HERDMASTER

Order furs

The fezzes come up
HERDMASTER

PILTDOWN
Thank you Brother Chairman

Fellow Buffaloes Im aman of few

he gets along without the heavy
equipment operators of Neolithic
101 Meeting adjourned

With angry grumbles and threats the meeting breaks up
Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are
slapped on The Buffalo run out

When the dust clears we see that only one member has
avoided the herding instinct Barney

Now he turns runs into --

Fred looks back and sees --

FELDSPAR AND GRAVEL

Coming up from rear Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he
pulls abreast of Fred

FELDSPAR
Flintstone Pull over
FRED
Oh no not now
Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder Fred smiles
nods

CLOSE ON FREDS FEET
He slams them down through the floorboard --

CUT TO
SLATE QUARRY - NIGHT

Led by Piltdown the workers have grabbed a big timber
which theyre using like a battering ram on the doors of
the assembly line building Suddenly with a crash the
doors go down Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the
angry workers rush past them
PILTDOWN
(loudly)
Now well show em whos boss
PYRITE
They cant push us around
Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody
juiced up and then when no one is looking
they slip out the back
REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT

Fred pulls into the lot slams his feet down to stop --
we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over slam right
through a storage area for crates and barrels which
collapse all around them

Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build-
ing knocking a hole in the wall
NEW ANGLE

Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust Neither one of
them sees what we see which is that visible in the hole
in the wall is the Slate Companys granite-doored safe

and right beside it is the Xenosaurus which now
jumps up startled dropping a crowbar and a big hand
drill

Recovering its composure the Xenosaurus grabs up the
tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away
vanishing just as our heroes stir

FRED

(peering through
the dust)

They rush into the plant
INT ASSEMBLY LINE - NIGHT 144

As the workers continue their rampage Piltdown and
Pyrite reappear
PYRITE
Darn that Flintstone and Rubble
theyre gonna screw everything

up

PILTDOWN
Not if we give em a nice long
vacation in the hospital

Saying this he grips tightly on a wrench Then some
rampaging workers rush by Piltdown gives them an encour-
aging cheer and then he and Pyrite lead them up some
stairs to the assembly line catwalk There Pyrite

begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club while
Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams
which he flings below

CLOSE - PYRITE 145
Winds up for another baseball-type swing -- but as he

follows through the ball-shaped light fixture jerks up

on its cable Unable to stop in time Pyrite spins

around falls on his ass

Barney drops down INTO VIEW hanging horizontally from
the rafters Hes holding the light fixture with his
free hand

BARNEY
Stee-rike one Heh-hey Ready
for a curve ball

Pyrite doesnt have a sense of humor club in hand
he jumps up starts chasing Barney through the rafters

PILTDOWN 146
Spits on his hand grabs another big beam He pulls down
on it but it doesnt snap it goes right up again
Puzzled he pulls down on it again theres another

see-saw motion
This time Piltdown goes with the flow pushes up and
peers under the beam

NEW ANGLE 147
Fred is hanging on the other end

FRED
Brother Piltdown can we talk
about this antler to antler

Piltdown roars begins slamming the girder up and down
FRED

Guess not
Fred inches down the shuddering beam jumps off Freed
of Freds weight the other end BOINGS down on
Piltdowns head He groans recovers in time to chase
after Fred
BARNEY AND PYRITE 148
Square off in the rafters

BARNEY

Give me your best shot
Pyrite swings Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW
pane Barney dodges again and the same thing happens
Getting cocky Barney does it one more time

but this time the window is hinged in the center and
the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back
and knocks him into Pyrites next blow

FRED 149
Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super-

structure of the assembly line Fred scrapes one foot in

an arc in front of him

FRED
Dare you to cross that line

Piltdown crosses it

FRED
That line

149
Piltdown crosses it Fred marks another one Piltdown
doesnt even wait for the challenge takes a giant step

Oops Bad idea The last line was at the edge of a

straight drop Piltdown yelps treads air in the best
cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of
Freds clothing Both men fall -- at the last minute

Piltdown catches a ladder
150 BELOW - ASSEMBLY LINE 150
Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to
form the Fibre products Worse the impact arouses the
goatasauruses out of their sleep Dutifully they rise
and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is
struggling to his feet Freds yell is muffled by the
clay

151 OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS 151
Aroused by the start up of the assembly line they do
their job Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough
The alligator crane picks up the mold shakes it

152 FRED 152
is flung to the conveyor belt stiffly caked in clay

153 THE FIBRE MOLD 153
shudders -- and shakes out a Fibre statue of Fred

154 BELOW 154

The real Fred moving stiffly like a robot is getting
to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the
mat again A moment later another Fred drops down
beside him

155 PILTDOWN 155
Has descended the ladder hopping mad Now he sees
Fred coming toward him Piltdown breaks a big lever off
the equipment swings -- reacts astonished as FRED
SHATTERS
156 FRED 156

Back down the line hes seen this His clay-caked
Adams apple gulps Quickly he turns and tries to

tip-toe away -- then with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the
clay and Fibre all over him solidifies Desperate he
tries to move cant

157 PILTDOWN 157

Watches confused as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug

towards him on the belt He shrugs smashes the next

one in line Another phoney He smashes the next one
CUT TO

158 UP ABOVE - BARNEY 158

Dodging Pyrites renewed attack Now Barney becomes

aware of the activated assembly line Getting an idea

he moves behind an inspection table grabs a big rubber
stamp

Pyrite comes around the corner Barneys head butts him

in the gut dodges under his legs Then as Pyrite

stumbles Barney stamps his ass with the word REJECT
Pyrite looks back sees this reddens raises his club
PYRITE

Reject huh Whaddya say we

reject your head
He raises the club when an alligator swings down and
grabs him by the seat of his pants Pyrite drops the
club howls --

WIDER
The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin
marked REJECTS -- and drops him

Howling Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and
defective Fibrerock goods

BARNEY

Chuckles to himself and then looks down reacts
CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet
another of the duplicate Freds

Worried Barney looks around sees that hes just above
the Fibrefoam chute Without another thought he jumps
into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the
Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --

BELOW

Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when
Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into
him and Fred All three of them roll across the floor
towards --

THE END OF THE BUILDING

where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a
dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel

FELDSPAR
All right Youre all under arr --

Wham Barney Fred and Piltdown roll right into the
cops who go flying like (what else) tenpins complete
with appropriate sound

BARNEY
(sitting up)
Whattya know Even got the spare

again

Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred whose head has
just fallen off
Pause Freds real head slowly pokes up out of the clay

and Fibre shoulders Before he can extricate himself
further Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of
the building

together as they do Lava sighs then jumps as Barney
comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder

Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of
Slate City Its even more grandiose than its
predecessor Now the housing development has two huge
office buildings beside it and then a convention center
beyond that

LAVA
As you can see the Fibrerock
is so light were using it for
construction for furnishings
for everything You cant stack
a two-bedroom cave this high
but the skys the limit with
Fibrerock

SLATE
Skys the limit skys the
limit why these two buildings
they they practically scrape

Slate scrapers

LAVA

convention center)

Slates so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly
listens to what Lavas saying just runs his stylus
through the wet clay of the statements meanwhile

framing the model city in his hands
LAVA
(heading for the
door)
Oh Mister Slate were going
to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent
Show in the uh Slate Needle
Good for public relations --
Lava breaks off Hes just looked out the window and
seen --

LAVAS POV - QUARRY BELOW WINDOW

A small figure appears behind some of the equipment
tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards
the assembly line

Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on
beard it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre
hermit or bum and then we realize hey this is
Barney

LAVA

Looks around spots Piltdown and Pyrite now resplendent
in security guard uniforms Lava whistles softly to get
their attention cant Then he sees one of Slates

golf trophies He shrugs throws it

BELOW - PILTDOWN

Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head then looks up
to see Lava gesticulating Piltdown nods grabs Pyrite
in tow

BARNEY

Looking around carefully Barney takes out a Thermos
bottle unscrews the top and quickly dunks it into the
Fibrerock foam Then he tiptoes 0S right into the
massive bulk of --

PILTDOWN
-- who looks down at him with a big smile Pyrite at his
side

PILTDOWN

BARNEY
(fake crotchety voice)

Ah yup yup young feller jest

drops and SHATTERS drag him 0S --

picketing workers of Neolithic 101
PILTDOWN

Emotionally Lava turns indicates a picture of Slate on
the wall

LAVA

The television crew has just finished nailing boards up
over the top of the fence Now the big potted plants
are dropped into place With each hammer stroke or thud

A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up Mr and

It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn

They head for the mastodon and pully-powered elevator

They break up laughing Fred chuckles looks at one of
the many old photographs strewn around

FRED

Boy those were the days Barney

Bedrock High winning all those

games and you and me right in

the middle of it

NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PHOTO 213
The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and

Barney in their cheerleading costumes Barney has a

sweater and megaphone Fred is in a Godzilla-like

mascot costume Hes holding the hideously-sculpted

head under his arm

BARNEY
Yeah Too bad we never made the
team

FRED
So what We made the team spirit
Thats just as important
whatever happened to those
cheerleader costumes

BARNEY
You know Betty She never throws
anything away

He hauls out an old footlocker opens it There they
are
FRED
(rummaging in it)
Boy Talk about memories

Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney who grins
pulls it on Fred also starts to get into his old
uniform but has to suck his gut in mightily Finally
he can zip it up stern to stem
FRED

Back then we thought a pop quiz

was a big problem We didnt

know how good we had it No

problems no worries

Saying this Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like
head He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail
behind his neck an even harder time swinging it down and
forward
BARNEY

Speaking of problems and worries

shouldnt we get on over to

Slates party
Fred has finally clinked the monster head down into
place Now when he talks the monsters mouth moves in
sync

FRED
(echo-y)
What for So him and all his
fancy friends can look down their
noses at us

Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit Fred
steps over to Barney stabs an angry claw in his
direction
FRED
(echo-y)
All theyve been doing is using us
Barney And meanwhile --

Now Fred reaches up to take the head off It sticks for
a moment Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge
where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood
FRED

(normal voice)
-- Meanwhile all the time they
were laughing at us

BARNEY

Yeah When did you notice that
FRED

About an hour ago
BARNEY

Boy theres no fooling you Fred
Suddenly with a GROWING CREAKING CRACKING and TINKLING
a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall
apart

Fred and Barney look at each other startled then rush
over to the model Its the interim version we saw
earlier

CLOSER - MODEL

The decomposition continues walls and supports turning
into sand and running down before our eyes In a Rube
Goldberg-like continuum the little houses go first
falling like dominoes
FRED
Wha whats happening

Barney tries to stop the process cant

214

BARNEY
I I dont know the Fibrerock
its its decomposing but
this shouldnt happen

FRED

Your old models are just fine
215 ANGLE 215
Indeed the older models from Barneys tinkering days
are rock solid

216 BACK TO SCENE 216

BARNEY
It should be Theres enough
coo-coo berry resin in there to
petrify a brontosaurus --
Suddenly Barney gets it He looks from the older models
to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing
awareness

BARNEY
(snapping his fingers)
-- The coo-coo berries Fred
thats it

FRED
Whats it

BARNEY
Remember I said the Fibrefoam
tasted funny It was the coo-coo
sap that was missing

FRED
But why would --

BARNEY
Why Because coo-coo berries are
as valuable as goldrock And
weve had tons of em delivered
to the plant since we started
somebody musta got greedy --

FRED
-- Not somebody -- Lava

BARNEY
(alarmed)
Fred that sap acts as a fixative
-- its the glue that holds the
whole formula together --

216

FRED
(with mounting concern)
Then whats happening here

BARNEY

(finishing it)
Is gonna happen for real in
the real Slate City

FRED
Oh no Barney Wilma and Betty
-- and the kids -- theyre all

there --
With a final WHIMPER the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN
and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES model story
by model story Finally the DISK on top of the needle
is all thats left wobbling around like a spun dinner

plate It finally falls EXPLODES
FRED
(worried)
-- B-barney what do we do

Barney runs to a locker grabs a big plunger-powered
flit gun begins filling it with a red liquid

BARNEY
Coo-coo berry sap Fred Its
our only chance -- their only

chance
Barney gives it a quick test squirt Fred nods and they
rush out of the room CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of

QUICK SHOTS - AUDIENCE 218
Their smiles become fixed (Up on the spotlights the

little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their

ears)

In the wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam DINO MOANS hides

his head under his paws

On the refreshment table GLASSES CRACK a cake falls
CLOSE ON LAVA 219

He surreptitiously checks his wrist watch
CUT TO

INT EMPTY FIBRERIDE - TIGHT ON ANOTHER WATCH - NIGHT 220

This one a pocket job (Like Lavas its really a

little sundial with a built-in burning match above it to

provide a shadow) We WIDEN and see that this watch

is held in a green scaley claw

ANOTHER ANGLE 221

Its the xenosaurus lurking behind the exhibits Now
the CREATURE GRUNTS confidently lights up a cigar
Then it picks up a canvas bag and a big toolbox and
tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the Fibre ride

CUT TO
INT FREDS CAR - TRAVELLING 222
Fred and Barney rush along Fred at the wheel
FRED
Whatll we do when we get there

BARNEY

We just tell Mister Slate that all
500 acres of his development are
going to crumble into dust any
minute

(holds up the

flit gun)
Then we zap the stairs and
corridors with some of this
coo-coo sap I just hope we have
enough to get everybody out --
whoops

Hes said this last because as he held up the flit gun
the handle whacked the back of Freds monster costume
and the head has flipped down with a solid clink

FRED
Barney --
(swerving all

over the road)
-- I cant see straight --

Barney gets up on his knees grabs the wheel with one
hand and the monster head with the other
BARNEY
Hang on hang on --

Oops He rotates the head completely around Fred
flails around Barney grabs the wheel with one hand
tries to help Fred with the other

EXT CAR - NIGHT

It careens around even more wildly now Theres several
near collisions

CUT TO
EXT ROCKDONALDS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Rockdonalds is of course complete with golden arches
of stone a drive-up window etc It even has the oblig-
atory cops on a break in this case Feldspar and
Gravel Theyre sitting in their patrol car eating from
little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonalds
Styrofoam (Of course the logo on the building behind
them proudly reads OVER 100 SOLD)
FELDSPAR
(mouth full bitching)
Speed traps again Face it
Gravel Im in a rut and
meanwhile the guys who went
through the academy with me
theyre all big shots now
Sam Slate Dirty Harock
Magma PI And you know why
Cause they got the breaks
thats why

Suddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING
TIRES and HONKING HORNS They look out their window
at --

FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST

both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume
head (By now their gyrations have put Barneys face
inside the jaws of the monster mask)

BACK TO SCENE 226
GRAVEL
S-sarge d-did you see that Some
sorta creature was attacking that
little guy --

FELDSPAR
Theres a lesson there Gravel

Besides --
(realizing)
-- Did you say creature

They do a big double-take at the now-vanishing car
FELDSPAR and GRAVEL
The xenosaurus

Excited Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a DISPATCH
PARAKEET in a police uniform pops INTO VIEW Feldspar
grabs it around the neck holds it like a microphone
FELDSPAR

This is a xenosaurus alert

Repeat a xenosaurus alert The

creature has been sighted on the

Slate City exit of the Venturock

Freeway It is driving a brown

late model sedan and eating a

white male Caucasian Car twelve

is in hot pursuit
He releases the bird which doesnt fly away right away
but gives him a look

FELDSPAR
(remembering)
Oh yeay over and out

The bird nods appeased flies off
DISPATCH PARAKEET
(as it goes)
Awwk Car Twelve is on the way
Car Twelve is on the way

FELDSPAR

(thrilled)
Gravel this could mean promotions
for both of us

(trotting up to

speed)
Load the shotgun and turn on the
siren

FREDS CAR - TRAVELLING 227
Barney is rocking Freds head back and forth finally

gives it one last mighty yank Something breaks

Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car

Fred drives with one hand raps the monster head

It rattles When Fred speaks again the monster mouth
no longer opens and closes in sync

FRED
(muffled shouting)
Ho gweat Hoo bwoke hit
Bahnee Hi khnat twalk hennymore
Suddenly both men (pardon man and xenosaurus) react to
an approaching SIREN They both look back at --

FELSPARS PATROL CAR

Closing in Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth
CAT and is cranking its tail As it WAILS away the
cops close in on our heroes

Fred pours on more speed They careen around a turn
CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign SLATE CITY--1 MI

SLATE CITY - REAR GATE

A fence surrounds the empty housing development in the
distance we can see the dark Slate Scrapers and past
them the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and

Slate Needle

We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup
Freds CAR as it whips around a turn two wheels off the
ground It crashes right into the gate knocking down a
sign reading SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE The fence
collapses all around the car

NEW ANGLE

Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck Barney
covered with debris rummages around and sighs with
relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is
still intact

BARNEY

(hearing a siren)

She steps aside as a spotlight picks out --

PEBBLES BAM-BAM and DINO 233
poised in the stances we recognize as the first

positions of the Dino Dance However whereas the

previous version of this was done impromptu and

a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw

hats alone this time the kids and Dino are fully

costumed with sequins batons and the like and the

dance is completely choreographed

KIDS
You can keep the twist
the frug and hop --

VARIOUS ANGLES 234
As the Dino dance begins FULL ORCHESTRATION OVER IT
The audience seems to really like it -- all except --

MRS SLATE

who glances over at the judges long enough to see that
they like this a lot better than the accordion act
Suddenly Mrs Slate jumps up barges on stage The
MUSIC DIES

HEADMISTRESS

Madame Slate what ees wrong --

MRS SLATE
Ill tell you whats wrong This
act is an absolute disgrace
This is supposed to be a talent
show And a pedestrian animal act
like this belongs in a circus

WILMA AND BETTY

React furious jump out of their seats

BETTY
A circus huh Well if our kids
belong in a circus with their act
then your little nephew belongs in
a zoo with his --

WILMA
Yeah -- a zoo where the animals
are dead -- because if they arent
they will be

MRS SLATE
Why how dare you Mrs
Flintstein Ill have you know
that my little Poindexter has been
trained by the finest tutors
Poindexter Show them Encore

The kid jumps up begins to play Immediately another
GLASS SHATTERS But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK
and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one
by one

MRS SLATE
(alarmed)
Ah Poindexter thats enough
Poindexter
The kids stops But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES

Then one of the tables collapses

Pause Every head in the room swivels around and stares
at Poindexter Nervous he tosses the accordion aside
But the destruction continues Another WINDOW PANEL
SHATTERS Then the entire building shakes

SLATE

Loses his balance grabs onto Lava for support ends up
pulling him down too Slate gets to his knees and looks
out the window and his jaw drops in astonishment
238 HIS POV - SLATE CITY 238

In the distance with a CRACKLING ROAR the little rows
of Fibrerock tract houses are falling like dominoes in

a wave that is rolling toward the Slate Needle
239 SLATE CITY DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT 239

A flashlight beam rakes the CAMERA Feldspar shotgun

in one hand light in the other looks around cautiously
(The shotgun has a slingshot mechanism the flashlight

is a mirror-backed candle)

Behind him FOOTSTEPS APPROACH Feldspar tenses but
its --
GRAVEL
No sign of the driver
FELDSPAR

of shinbones and a belch

Gravel drops down on one knee excited He shines his
light on Freds big clawprints

They aim their lights at the tracks begin to follow
them Suddenly they round a corner and come face to

240 NEW ANGLE - FRED 240

Hes stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with
the monster head again Now he freezes in twin flash-
light beams

FELDSPAR
Okay lizard reach for the sky
Fred hesitates then hearing a CREAK and GROAN he

looks at the HOUSE beside him The stucco-like exterior
of Fibrerock is beginning to crumble

O-one flick of his paw and
he knocked down a wall --
FRED

Nogh wate chum baggk --
As Fred roars and moves forward Feldspar and Gravel
scream panic and run
FRED

Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged
house It collapses totally falling in on itself
obscuring Fred Finally the last TIMBER DROPS Pause
Fred staggers out of the rubble realizes that the impact
has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its
hinges He rubs dust out of his eyes turns and looks

at the Slate Needle Hes much closer to it now

Quickly he runs toward it
CUT TO

Everyone is rocking back and forth with the escalating
vibrations of the swaying building The remaining table

The supporting pylons and cable anchors begin to slowly
decompose A FLIGHT of STAIRS CREAKS AND GROANS

Barney runs INTO the SHOT sees the steps about to go

of Fibredust Now he whirls as Fred runs up points --
FRED

Barney The elevator --

Barney runs toward it hits the button
OTHER SIDE OF WALL 246
REVEALING elevator mechanism The button pokes a mouse
which runs out of a box Seeing the mouse a nearby
mastadon becomes frightened begins running A heavy
cable tied to the mastadon runs over a pulley and into --
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT 247
-- where the elevator rises out of the sub-level and
INTO VIEW Fred and Barny start towards it when
suddenly the Fibrerock elevator begins to crumble
FRED
Quick Use your coo-coo gun --

Barney aims pulls back the plunger too late The
elevator is gone The cable swings back and forth
loosely “whapping the shaft walls as it shoots upwards
Fred dives for the cable misses As he stumbles Barney
leaps on Freds back catches the cable As Barney
starts to whizz upwards Fred garbs onto his ankles

ABOVE - FIBRESPHERE 248
Propelled upwards the would-be rescuers shoot OUT of

CUT TO
INT BEDROCK POLICE STATION - NIGHT 249

The POLICE CHIEF looks skeptically at Feldspar and
Gravel who are exhausted covered with dust uniforms
torn

( )

CHIEF
Feldspar if you ask me youve
seen too many Rockzilla movies In
all the Xenosaurus sightings weve
had reported not one has had this
kind of wholesale destruction --

FELDSPAR
Chief you -- you gotta believe me
-- just one swipe of its paw and
-- wham -- a whole house was

pre-history --

Suddenly one of those police DISPATCH PARAKEETS comes
flying excitedly through the window lands on a perch in
front of the Chief

DISPATCH PARAKEET
Calling all cars Calling all cars
Unconfirmed reports of destruction
and collapse at Slate City
Rescue vehicles are on the way
The xenosaurus has been spotted
in the area That is all That

is all
FELDSPAR

You see -- I told you --
CHIEF

All right Feldspar Im

convinced As of this moment

youre completely in charge of

operation

waited for all his life

CUT TO
INT FIBRESPHERE - NIGHT

Dust and little fragments of construction material are
still tinkling down around our heroes The elevator
cable sways from its uppermost pulley Slowly something
stirs in the pile of arms legs and scaly limbs

First to sit up is Barney who groans rubs his head
Next Fred sits up Damn The impact has knocked Freds
monster mask back on his head Fred mutters angrily
Barney starts to help and then they both notice that
theres another monstrous head in the middle of their
group Therere big takes all around and then the

xenosaurus leaps out of the tangle of bodies treads
air and runs away
BARNEY
(recovering)

Fred stop it It might know

the way inside
Fred gets up to speed and chases the xeno Barney
follows

NEW ANGLE

Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus --
all crash through a wall --
INT SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT

The panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall

collapses Dust and debris billow upwards The battered

monster mask breaks loose from Freds costume bounces

on the floor Slowly everyone gets up Fred Barney
and two halves of the xenosaurus

The bottom half is Piltdown the top-half is Pyrite

WILMA BETTY
Fred Barney
PEBBLES BAM-BAM
Daddy Pop
FRED BARNEY
Piltdown Pyrite
SLATE
What the devils going on here
FRED

Its real simple Mister Slate
Your boy Lava here has been
stealing the coo-coo berries from
the Fibrerock mix and fixing the
books to hide it

LAVA
Thats ridiculous Flintstone
Nobody could get that many coo-coo
berries off our premises

Suddenly the bottom of Piltdowns canvas sack rips

open Thousands and thousands of coo-coo berries tumble
out

LAVA

Slaps his hands over his face

THE SCENE

Suddenly the
the ceiling

BETTY
(dryly)
These sure look like coo-coo
berries to me --

LAVA
(smoothly)
Theyre convincing fakes Mrs
Rubble -- part of our exciting
display --
PYRITE
Fakes

(to Piltdown)
Gee Pilty I thought the real
ones were gonna be moved up here

for us ta steal -- whatta waste
a time --

PILTDOWN
Pyrite shaddup --

FRED

(snapping fingers)
Now I remember These guys were
pulling this xenosaurus act that
night at the plant Whats this
Lava Plan B
LAVA
Uncle Are you going to stand
there while aspersions are being
cast at the Slate family This
is absurd --

SLATE
Of course it is Why without
the coo-coo berry sap Fibrerock
would be completely --
(realizing)
-- unstable

entire building shudders Dust falls from
Everyone looks at Lava

LAVA

All right all right I admit it

I got in over my head in the stock

market took some big losses

I had these guys pull jobs for me

all over town disguised as a

monster but it still wasnt

enough and when I saw all those

coo-coo berries being delivered

every day I guess I just lost my

head I figured with the Woca

sap in the Fibremix the berry

juice as superfluous

SLATE

Ill tell you whats superfluous

Lava your liver So why dont

we remove it --
He leaps snarling on top of Lava Fred and Barney
pull them apart Then more falling dust and beams give
everyone more pressing problems --

CUT TO

EXT SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT 255
Rescue VEHICLES and police CARS ROAR up slam to a halt
CAT SIRENS WAILING The rescue workers jump out
Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched
to bamboo frames others go to the back of their trucks
and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to
raise the ladders
CLOSE ON A HOOK AND LADDER TRUCK 256

Its actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus
which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred-
ibly long neck The bony plates on the creatures back
make perfect stairs

However the creature is noticeably listless and
uncooperative

FIRE CHIEF
Come on come on whats the hold
up --

FIREFIGHTER

Its the kibble crisis sir --

the firesauruses have been on

half-rations for a month
Above them the BUILDING SHUDDERS again

257 IN THE SLATE NEEDLE 257
Now the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down When they
hit the floor the oil lamps inside spills and fire
spreads
WILMA
(pointing)
Fred Theres a fire hose --

Indeed its on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE
HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS Fred and Barney
take a step towards it but the fire quickly spreads and
cuts them off

Helpless they step back

With a THUNDEROUS ROAR the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible
through whats left of the picture window COLLAPSE Then
the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to
decompose It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture

in a storm finally for a split second it is well
life-sized and then the head of the statue snaps loose
CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here
rolls up to Slates feet

Pause Everyone looks at everyone else This is it
Titanic time Fred embraces Wilma Barney embraces
Betty Their kids are pulled into the clinch Even
Slate takes Mrs Slates hand Talk about grace under
pressure and speaking of --

258 GRACE

-- the star fashion model suddenly her Fibrethread
costume decomposes leaving her in her cute little
animal print undies

259 BETTY

In the middle of going down with the ship she turns
Bam-Bams face away from this display

BAM-BAM
D-dad are we gonna be okay
BARNEY
(pause false smile)
Sure pal We just gotta wait for
the fire department Right Fred

FRED
Y-yeah Everythings gonna be
just -- Whoa hoo-hah aggh --

Hes started yelping because hes realized his arm is
on fire and now he jumps up and the others begin beating
at the arm with anything in their hands and then Fred
suddenly pushes away from them stands there with a small
flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas stage
magician
FRED
-- Wait a minute -- I dont feel

anything at all --

With his other claw he slaps tentatively at the flames
and then confidentially snuffs it out

BARNEY
It must be the suit Fred -- old
Bedrock High built them things to

last --
Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the
guests from the fire hose As everyone gets the same
idea Dino rushes up the costume head in his mouth
All brighten

Barney helps Fred with the head twists it into place
BARNEY
(rapping on the head)
-- Okay
FRED
Hist hust fine
He lowers his head runs through the fire which licks
at him harmlessly Then with his claw he SMASHES the
amber GLASS --

IN THE BOX

A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside SNORING (Note
to herpetologists The pythonosaurus is not quite a
snake it has little vestigial forepaws the better to
emote with Right now the snoring head is in those

little paws)

The Pythonsaurus stirs looks at Fred sniffs the
smoke Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say
one moment Then the pythonsaurus turns his head
towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages slurps
loudly

We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away

IN THE MAIN ROOM 261
Everyone retreats from the fire Slate picks up the head
of the statue his only souvenir

WITH FRED

Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally
finishes drinking It wipes its mouth daintily with a
napkin slaps a little fire helmet on its head turns
and runs back into the other room (Behind him yards
and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart-
ment behind the box) Water shoots out of the creatures
mouth

WIDER

Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of
flame in the room All the guests cheer rush forward
and slap Fred on the back Pebbles jumps up on him and
kisses him

FRED
Hit fuzz nudding wheely
The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention
PYTHONSAURUS
Hey what am I chopped liver
BARNEY
Come on everybody -- well go

out the way we came
Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun solidifying
a route in the crumbling Fibrerock Then Barney and
Fred stand back nobly wave everyone on into the adjacent
Fibresphere

POINDEXTER
(pushing and shoving)
Outta the way -- outta the way --
women and children first -- I
mean ah children and women
first yeah yeah provided that
uh theres room for the women

Meanwhile the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his
costume) a big look up and down looks TOWARD the CAMERA

PYTHONSAURUS
Hey not bad Wonder if she lives
around here
Just then Fred tilts back the monster head The

pythonsaurus reacts

263
PYTHONSAURUS
Heartbreaker

Depressed the pythonsaurus follows the others Fred and
Barney cross over into the Fibresphere As the do Slate
Needle completely collapses

EXT FIBRESPHERE - LONG SHOT 264
The Slate Needle tumbles down taking a big chunk of the

heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake
both put their hands on the cable and then the whole
pulley mechanism falls right down between them and
through the hole A second later the entire remaining
structure collapses

BELOW 273
Everyone reacts in horror --
ABOVE 274

Dust and smoke clear When we can see again well its
not a pretty sight The entire fibresphere is gone All
thats left teetering on two spindly supports are two
tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of
rubble too small for a human to negotiate and all
thats holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the
ground

Amazingly they grab scraps of wood borrow fire

fighters helmets and begin to do a buck and wing

WILMA AND BETTY

You can keep the twist

BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO 281
MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on His eyes

fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly

bridge that leads to his master and friends

ANOTHER ANGLE 282

Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo duplicating his

steps in The Dino Dance He reaches the other island

Without a beat still keeping time he puts the two kids
on his shoulders just like in the dance Then he

presents his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to
Barney -- and then --
LONG SHOT 283

-- Dino slides down the long wire carrying everyone to
safety They all plow into the biggest rescue net as
Wilma and Betty wind up

WILMA AND BETTY
Yes I dont need to shimmy
I dont need to bop
Cause Im doin doin doin
THE IGNEOUS ROCK

FRED 284
rolls out of the net and away from the others Hes

slightly stunned still in the suit He sits up

suddenly lights snap on all around him Fred looks up

and sees --

HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS 285

All with weapons aimed right at him Spotlights on the
police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic
mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys

Feldspar is at the head of the group He cocks his
shotgun The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch
menacingly --

FELDSPAR
Its the xenosaurus -- stand back
men -- its a vicious killer --
Ready -- Aim --

FRED

(with desperate poignancy)

High ham noght a zenosore High

ham hay hooman beeng --
BAM WHAM KABAM Bullets and projectiles begin
slamming all around Fred He ducks behind a big fallen
chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets
and shells bounce off its resilient surface
CLOSE - FRED
Momentarily safe he tries desperately to remove that
stupid head -- bangs it against the wall tears at it
with his claws --
-- meanwhile the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him
decomposes Hes back in the line of fire
DINO

Flanked by Wilma Barney and the kids who are shouting
for the police to stop only Dino the wonder bronto has
the wits to act

YI-YI-YI-ING he races forward CAMERA FOLLOWING --
and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Freds
monster suit and -- de-pants him

Instantly Dino whirls Fred around points to the now
revealed striped undershorts

WIDER
Pause
( )

Then Officer Gravel takes a good look at that rear end

GRAVEL
Hey those are the biggest shorts
Ive ever seen
(realizing)

It it must be Mister
Flintstone Cease fire
(to Feldspar)
Gee Sarge now you dont have
to shoot him --

Now Fred confirms Gravels hunch as the costume head
finally pops off All the cops lower their guns
(Strangely though Feldspar still continues to raise

his gun -- even aims Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles
it away from his superior)
289 THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN 289

Safe they all emotionally embrace Fred even suffers
Dinos affection (In the bg a police car holding
Piltdown Pyrite and Lava drives past Poindexter Lava
is chasing the car)
POINDEXTER
(distant)

Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug
SLATE

poignancy)

HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION

Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see
As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City
collapse crushing a police car

BACK TO SCENE

SLATE
(casually)
Oh you never know

RESCUE DINOS

Several sniff at the air look curiously at a nearby
pile of crumbled Fibrerock One and then another
shuffles over tentatively tastes some grins and
digs in Seeing this the firesauruses crane out
their necks also begin chowing down on the pile of
Fibrerock crumbs

FRED BARNEY SLATE AND OTHERS
All turn at the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT

Now DINO YI-YI-YIS past this group and leaps into the
pile munching like crazy

Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower
down like rain from the feeding frenzy Catching some
pieces he nibbles on it a little

FRED

nutrients are all released

Disbelieving Fred moves over to the happily-munching
animals He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with
the pack He grabs some stuffs it in his mouth

restaurant A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS

A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over

Fred holds up one finger towards her She nods scampers
OS Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici-
pation and then the girl returns with a massive rack
of ribs on a car tray She hooks it on the edge of

the drivers door and the entire car tips over with a
crash

asleep on her shoulder Fred follows the saber-tooth
cat on his heels Fred stops in the doorway to put a
milk bottle on the doorstep and then puts the cat down
beside it He shuts the door

Quick as a flash the cat leaps through the side window
Pause The door opens and the cat puts Fred out then
slams the door Fred recovers from his shock tries the
door its locked
