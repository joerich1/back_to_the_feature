FADE IN
EXT SUBURBAN HOME - LE MESA SAN DIEGO - DUSK 1

SUPER “1981”

Two eager and anxious 10-year-olds make their way up the path
to the front steps Meet skinny CHARLIE KAGAN and his best
friend the portly STU KLAMINSRY

They each carry gifts Charlie’s present is meticulously
wrapped with bow and ribbon Stu’s is cobbled together with
newspaper and duct tape

STU
(excited)
Seven minutes in heaven What
could be better than seven minutes
in heaven

CHARLIE
Eight minutes in heaven
(off Stu’s look)
What

STU
Try not to embarrass me okay

CHARLIE
(grabs his friend’s arm)
Wait Stuey run it by me again
(cramming)
Second base is boob Inside or
outside the shirt

STU
Inside man And third base is
finger

CHARLIE
Finger

STU
Or thumb

CHARLIE
I should have written this down
(head spinning)
Boob finger thumb so what the
heck is first base
STU
Kissing

CHARLIE
So I’ve gone to first base with my
Mom

STU

Tonque kissing

CHARLIE
Oh okay got it And a home run
(Stu gives him a look)
Duh I know what a home run is
(then)
Anything else I need to know

sTU
An intentional walk is a kiss on
the cheek Rain delay is when
grown-ups interrupt you in the
middle of your game And an inside
the park home run is a blowjob

They arrive on the doorstep

CHARLIE
What’s a blowjob

STU
(without missing a beat as
he rings the bell)
I have no idea But I overheard my
dad saying that he gets one once a
year on his birthday so it must be
good

BRITTA COOKSEY a prepubescent peach opens the door

CHARLIE
Happy birthday Britta

BRITTA

(pleased)
Hi Charlie

(flat)
Stu

(sultry smile)
Cmon party’s downstairs in the
basement

She winks conspiratorially Off Charlie and Stu’s look
INT BASEMENT - A LITTLE LATER 2

OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN moans the lyrics to “Physical” as we go
CLOSE ON A SPINNING BOTTLE

PULL OUT as the bottle slows and comes to a stop pointing to
a little blonde pixie named JENNIFER Stu throws up his
hands in triumph The PARTY-GOERS shriek with glee

STU
You Me Closet Seven minutes
Heaven

Jennifer looks like she just received a death sentence As
she and Stu walk toward the closet we catch Charlie eyeing
the birthday girl in rhapsody

He awkwardly smiles at her We RACK-FOCUS to discover
another little girl catching the look She’s a GOTH GIRL
outcast and hasn’t taken her eyes off Charlie all evening
She just STARES while fingering a Wicca-style pentagram
necklace that hangs around her neck It’s a little creepy

A couple of the school-kids snicker and LOCK Stu and Jennifer
inside the closet

INT OVERSIZED CLOSET - CONTINUOUS 3

Stu starts to saunter over to Jennifer attempting his best
James Dean (but coming off more like Porky Pig)

JENNIFER
Stop
(opening the negotiation)
Okay I’1l tell everybody we kissed
if you stand on that side of the
closet and don’t touch me

STU
Deal If you say we did the nasty

JENNIFER
I’1l say you touched my breasts

sTU
Say I touched you “down there”

JENNIFER
I’ll say you touched me “down
there” but over my pants
STU
Deal Pleasure doing business with
you

They both sit on opposite sides of the closet and wait for
time to expire

INT BASEMENT - SIX AND A HALF MINUTES LATER 4
CLOSE ON A BOTTLE -- a little hand comes into frame and grabs
it

PULL BACK to REVEAL that it’s Charlie’s turn to spin He
looks around the circle zeroing in on Britta

STU
Wait

Stu pulls Charlie aside and whispers to him

STU (cont’d)
Who are you aiming for

CHARLIE
(swooning)
The birthday girl

STU
You take wind speed into account

Charlie glances up to see the spinning ceiling fan He nods

CHARLIE
Wind speed contour of the bottle
friction resistance
(then)
How did it go with Jennifer

sTU
Blowjob I’11 tell you about it
later

The boys head back to the circle and Charlie carefully SPINS
THE BOTTLE

It turns And turns And turns Slowing as it reaches
Britta Cooksey Yes Closer Closer

Nooooooooo It just misses her and spins past And
POINTS DIRECTLY at the GOTH GIRL Charlie smiles
uncomfortably She just STARES
INT CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER 5

We hear the terrifying CLICK of the DOOR LOCKING behind them
as Bauhaus’ “Bela Lugosi’s Dead” plays

The Goth Girl stares at Charlie

CHARLIE
Stop staring You’re freaking me
out

GOTH GIRL

I’m looking at you ‘cause I like
you Charlie It’s okay C’mon
You can do what you want

CHARLIE
That’s okay I’m kind of new at
this
(awkward shrug)
Rookie
(awkward beat)
That’s a baseball term

GOTH GIRL
(abrupt)
Let me see your penis
Charlie starts to stumble back as Goth Girl approaches
GOTH GIRL (cont’d)
What’s the matter Don’t you want

me

She PULLS OFF HER SHIRT revealing a LEATHER TRAINING BRA

CHARLIE
(loudly)
Oh my God
EXT CLOSET - CONTINUOUS 6

Outside the door the kids listen with amusement
STU
That was quick
INT CLOSET - CONTINUOUS 7

Goth Girl is all over him now Kissing him
CHARLIE
Wait I can’t breathe

He pushes her off BLACK LIPSTICK SMEARED ALL OVER HIS FACE

GOTH GIRL
I love you Charlie I‘ve loved
you since third grade

CHARLIE
You’re scaring me

Charlie stumbles back Pulling himself up on clothes hanging
in the closet

GOTH GIRL
So you like to play hard to get

She rips his shirt open

CHARLIE
Back off

GOTH GIRL
I read in my Mom’s Cosmo this is
supposed to increase pleasure

She pounces her FINGERNAILS scrape down his chest He
SCREAMS in pain trying to crawl from under her

GOTH GIRL (contd)
Don’t worry this is my first time
too

CHARLIE
First time what Killing

GOTH GIRL
No silly Making love Now

She awkwardly TWISTS HIS NIPPLES Charlie screams

CHARLIE
Ow You freak

He bucks her off him and RUNS at the closet door BREAKING
THROUGH THE SHUTTERED PANELS
EXT CLOSET - CONTINUOUS 8

Charlie falls to the ground surrounded by kids looking on in
shocked amusement

The Goth Girl steps out and angrily glares at him

GOTH GIRL
Charlie Kagan you are not my
boyfriend anymore

STU
We interrupt this news report to
bring you the following information
-- no duh

Goth Girl stands above Charlie who struggles to stand

GOTH GIRL
I hex you

CHARLIE
You what

GOTH GIRL
I hex you You will never be
happy

STU
Right on Turn him into a toad

The Goth Girl spins on Charlie possessed She spits a curse
at him

GOTH GIRL
(possessed)
Around you love will fall like
rain but you shant hold it - your
heart will pain Once the girl has
been with you to the next she will
be true

STU
Is that Phil Collins

Charlie is finally standing but Goth Girl PUSHES HIM BACK
INTO THE CLOSET AGAIN AND EXITS

STORAGE BOXES rain on top of Charlie Stu rushes into the
closet and looks down at the still-terrified Charlie
STU (cont’d)
What happened Did you thumb her

off Charlie’s scarred-for-life look we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SAN DIEGO BEACH - NIGHT 9

The ocean water shimmers in the moonlight Two lovers kiss
passionately by the shore

SUPER “Present”

REVEAL CHARLIE (now 30s) and CAROL his current girlfriend

Charlie has a boyish charm and an infectious grin He’s the
kind of friend who would donate his liver so you could have

another drink

Charlie pulls up for air

CHARLIE
Youre amazing

CAROL
(mischievous )
Now Charlie are you just trying
to get me into bed

CHARLIE
Forget bed I’m trying to get you
into sand
She leans back and pulls him down onto the wet beach
Clothes are torn off Both are completely naked It’s the
NC-17 version of “From Here to Eternity”

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Um this is a public beach

Carol disappears below frame Charlie moans

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Oh my God Carol

CAROL
I love you

Charlie is silent She repeats it in case he didn’t hear

CAROL (cont’d)
I love you
Charlie doesn’t respond Carol surfaces

CAROL (cont’d)
I love you Charlie

CHARLIE
That’s nice

CAROL
That’s “nice” I’m licking sand
off your balls and you say that’s
nice”

CHARLIE
No I said “Oh my God” about that
Believe me it was a very
enthusiastic “Oh my God”

Carol stands up and grabs her clothes

CHARLIE (contd)
I love that you love me

CAROL
That’s pathetic

Carol starts to walk away Charlie covers his groin with his
shirt and chases her down the beach

CHARLIE
Wait I feel very strongly for you

She keeps walking faster now He stumbles behind

CHARLIE (contd)
I’m sorry I just don’t think the
“L” word should be thrown around
casually that’s all

CAROL
The “L” word What are you eight

CHARLIE
“Love” Okay “love” It
shouldn’t be bandied about

CAROL
How about the “F” word And the
“U word

Without looking back she walks away down the beach

Defeated Charlie walks back to the spot where they
undressed

He looks for his pants -- but they have WASHED AWAY in the
waves
EXT BEACH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 10

A soaking wet Charlie still holding his shirt over himself
approaches his car in the empty parking lot

LOCKED Damn
As he plays with the door a SIREN WHIRS and LIGHTS FLASH A
police car stops in front of him A BUTCH FEMALE POLICE
OFFICER gets out of the car and calls to him over the
loudspeaker
POLICE OFFICER (LOUDSPEAKER)
Put your hands up where I can see
them

Charlie awkwardly starts to raise his hands (and the shirt
covering himself)

POLICE OFFICER (lOUDSPEAKER) (contd)
Down Put your hands back down
INT BUILDING LOBBY - DAY 11

Charlie and STU (now 30s) grab drinks from a coffee cart by
the pharmacy of Charlie’s building

Stu has become a plastic surgeon He was a nerd as a kid
and success has now made Stu a nerd with too much money

He has a little dried blood on his jacket

CHARLIE
You going to Katie’s wedding next
week

STU

Do bridesmaids give head in the
coat room Do you know how easy it
is to score at a wedding

CHARLIE
Have you ever scored at a wedding
sTU
(defensive)
I’m pacing myself
(then)
Hey is it weird that you were
dating Katie six months ago and now
she’s marrying a doctor

CHARLIE
T’ma doctor

sTU
He’s a heart surgeon you’re a
dentist It’s like saying General
Patton and Colonel Mustard are both
military men

CHARLIE
I’m thinking that this might be the
last conversation we ever have So
if there’s anything you want to
tell me now is definitely the
time

STU
Your mother sucks a mean cock
(without missing a beat)
You going to the wedding with
Carol

CHARLIE
Nah We broke up three weeks ago

sTU
Why didn’t you tell me

CHARLIE
I did Three times

STU
She was so into you man

CHARLIE
Yeah I just-- I don’t know what’s
wrong with me I want love I
want to fall in love but

STU
Chuck love is not a four letter
word

CHARLIE
Actually it is
(changing the subject re
Stu’s clothes)
Why are you always spackled in
blood

STU
Hey breast reconstruction is a
messy job

THEY STEP INTO THE ELEVATOR to head up to their offices

CHARLIE
(thoughtful)
Does seeing breasts every day
you know

STU
That’s disgusting I’11 have you
know that I’m a professional

A beat Then unable to hold it STU LAUGHS LOUDLY

The doors close on him laughing

INT HALLWAY - OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 12

They get out of the elevator and move to their separate
offices Stu’s sign reads ”DR STUART KLAMINSKY --
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY” Charlie’s reads “DR CHARLES
KAGAN DDS” The two best friends are literally across the
hallway from each other

A GIGANTICALLY BUXOM BLONDE approaches Stu’s office

BUXOM BLONDE
Hi Dr Stu

She disappears inside

STU
(sly whisper)
I’ve jerked off to her X-rays

CHARLIE
I hope you find the time to write
to me from Hell

Just then a LARGE BLACK WOMAN (imagine if Queen Latifah ate
Oprah) opens Charlie’s door from the inside This is REBA
his office managersecretary

REBA
Dr Charlie you’re five minutes
late You’ve got four fillings
three cleanings two crowns and a
canal You’ve got too many
patients and I’ve got too little
patience for you to be gabbing
gossip with Dr Boobjobs in the
hallway

STU
Hi Reba nice to see you

Reba doesn’t acknowledge him She starts back in but
suddenly spins on Stu

REBA
Were you just looking at my tits

STU
What No

REBA
Because I am more than happy with
what the Lord Almighty gave me
And if you don’t want me to squash
you like the bug that you are--

STU
(actually scared)
I promise I wasn’t looking at--

Reba holds up a finger silencing him Temporarily
satisfied she walks back in the office dragging Charlie
back inside with her

INT EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 13

Charlie washes his hands as his DENTAL INTERN hovers over a
beautiful patient TRACEY with the suction

CHARLIE
Hi I’m Charlie

Tracey gurgles a greeting Charlie rolls over in his chair
and gently adjusts his assistant’s technique

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Easy with the suction there We
want saliva not her spleen

Charlie smiles warmly down at Tracey and takes over

CHARLIE (cont’d)
So you lost a cap

TRACEY
Chewing ice
(boldly flirty)
My shrink says I have an oral
fixation

CHARLIE
(amiably evasive)
My shrink says I need to stop
dating my patients

TRACEY
Sounds like we both need to fire
our shrinks

off her suggestive smile we

CUT TO

INT TRACEY’S APARTMENT - MORNING 14

Charlie and Tracey are in the throws of a sweaty and

deafening love-making session She is yelling so loudly that
it’s becoming embarrassing Charlie tries to inconspicuously
cover his ears with his pillow A car alarm goes off outside

Finally the locomotive reaches the station and the two are
silent in bed for a few moments

CHARLIE
My ears are ringing
Beat
TRACEY
I’ve been dishonest with you
CHARLIE
You faked it
TRACEY
Yes but that’s not what I’m
talking about
Charlie sits up “Huh”

TRACEY (cont’d)
I sought you out Last week
(off his confused look)
(MORE)

TRACEY (cont‘d)
I work at the hospital and you
dated two of my friends Amy from
Radiology and Penny from Trauma

CHARLIE
I didn’t realize that they were
such big fans Well I hope we
last longer than I did with them

TRACEY
Yeah about that I’m afraid this

is it
Charlie takes this in He is genuinely hurt

CHARLIE
Wow I must really suck

TRACEY
No you were good Really

CHARLIE
Is that why you faked it

TRACEY
Sorry Force of habit Unlucky in
love I guess
(off his doe-eyed face)
You want to give it another shot

Charlie still taken aback offers up a dispirited shrug
She kisses and gently snuggles into him

CHARLIE
So how are the girls
TRACEY
Married
CHARLIE
Both of them
(she nods)

I dated Penny like last year

TRACEY
(nodding)
She met some Prince while
vacationing in Cabo

CHARLIE
Jeez feels like everybody is
getting married
(suddenly panicked)
(MORE)

CHARLIE (contd)
Youre still my date for the
wedding aren’t you I really
don’t want to show up at my old
girlfriend’s wedding flying solo

TRACEY
(playful nod)
But only because I broke your
heart

He smiles partially placated
CHARLIE
(trying to gain face)

I think it’s only fair to let you
know I faked it too

INT COUNTRY CLUB - A LITTLE LATER 15

The reception is in full swing Drinking dancing eating
An EIGHTY-YEAR-OLD WOMAN finishes off a gut-wrenchingly
horrific rendition of “Oops I Did it Again” before the
cheesy DJ cuts her off

DJ
Thank you Grandma Loretta Up
next we have Uncle Murray singing
“Darling Nikki”

Yes it is a KARAOKE WEDDING -- God help us all

In the far corner (furthest from the speakers) Stu hovers
next to Charlie

STU
Listen you’re my wing-man If the
blonde asks I’m a multi-
billionaire who invented ketchup
If it’s the redhead I wrote “We
Are the World” And if it’s that
cheerleader hottie my penis is in
the Guinness Book of World Records
Girth not length I want it to
sound believable

Charlie nods without listening He’s too busy watching
Tracey chat it up with the BEST MAN

A BEAUTY in a bridesmaid dress walks by Stu smiles

STU (cont‘d)
Batter up

He follows her off as the bride KATIE sidles up next to
Charlie She kisses him on the cheek as Uncle Murray grinds
the stage floor

CHARLIE
You look great

KATIE
So do you
(looking around)
Seeing anyone

Charlie points toward Tracey in the corner

CHARLIE
We’re getting serious

Katie looks over just as Tracey inhales the Best Man’s
tongue

CHARLIE (cont’d)
(backpedaling)
And at the same time we try to
give each other our space

Katie looks at Charlie sadly

KATIE
I worry about you sometimes Chuck
Always a bridesmaid never a bride

CHARLIE
It’s probably best White makes my
calves look thick

KATIE
(touching his hand)
Joke all you want “The door to

the human heart can only be opened
from the inside”

(off his look)
Dorky definitely But also true

CHARLIE
How about “It’s better to have
loved and lost than never to have
loved at all”

KATIE
I’1ll buy that when you can honestly
told me that you have loved

CHARLIE
(nods )
Touche’

KATIE
I just want to see you happy
Chuckles

ON STAGE -- Uncle Murray throws out his hip As he’s helped
off the stage the DJ amps up the crowd

DJ
Attention Hot Mamas If we could
have all the single ladies out on
the dance floor for the tossing of
the bride’s bouquet

Charlie watches on amused He notices that his Tracey is
still in the far corner flirting with the Best Man He
looks a little hurt

A DRUM-ROLL starts as Katie teases all the single ladies with
the bouquet

DJ (cont’d)
And the next lucky lady is

Katie throws the bouquet high in the air

A few of kids jump for them -- the flailing hands KNOCKING
THE FLOWERS BACK INTO THE AIR The bouquet flies up and hits
a revolving fan in the ceiling shooting the bundle DIRECTLY
INTO THE HANDS OF TRACEY Surprised she holds them up

INT COUNTRY CLUB - RECEPTION - A LITTLE LATER 16

The party has calmed and dinner is almost digested Charlie
sits at a table with several PRETTY SINGLE GIRLS A couple
of chairs are vacant -- including the one for his date who
is nowhere to be found

ON STAGE -- an eight-year-old FLOWER GIRL sings “Brick House”
in the key of “Q”

Charlie and one of the women are in mid-conversation

PRETTY GIRL 3
Id rather have a twelve-hour
colonoscopy than get my teeth
cleaned I hate dentists

Charlie attempts his best friendly smile At the other end
of the room (and not a minute too soon) there is a CLINK OF
GLASS -- all eyes look to the head table

Katie STANDS and addresses her friends and family

KATIE
I just want to thank everybody for
coming to share this day with us
(looking to her husband)
Hans you make my heart soar I
couldn’t imagine being happier than
I am right now

A GROOMSMAN calls out from the table

GROOMSMAN
Wait till tonight sweetheart

The crowd chuckles Katie raises her glass

KATIE
I know it’s a little unorthodox but
Id also like to propose a toast
To Charlie Kagan

Charlie is surprised to hear his name called Katie winks at
him

KATIE (cont’d)
Thank you Charlie for being my
lucky charm

There is a confused smattering of applause as everyone
drinks “To Charlie”

Charlie doesn’t drink trying to figure out what the hell
she’s talking about One of the girls at his table looks at
him with interest

PRETTY GIRL 2
Youre that Charlie

CHARLIE
What Charlie

PRETTY GIRL 2
(covering)
That Charlie that’s a dentist

Charlie gives her a “huh” look WE SEE Pretty Girl 2
whispering to 3 In response she CHORTLES out loud

PRETTY GIRL 3
Yeah right What-ever

Charlie gives them all a look -- something is weird

SUDDENLY directly behind Charlie A BUSBOY and A GUEST
collide CRASH A flying wine bottle almost decapitates
him

Charlie looks up to find CAMERON WEXLER -- perky cute anda
klutz in the most adorable sense She now wears a fair
amount of RED WINE on her WHITE JACKET

CAMERON
(without missing a beat)
Table five

Charlie nods and offers her his napkin to dry her jacket
Cameron embarrassingly mouths “thank you” and sits

CAMERON (cont’d)
(to Charlie touch of
irony)
So did I miss anything

As she hears the answer she busies herself by crossing out
the “ERON” on her table name card

CHARLIE
Let’s see to have and to hold
love respect I do I do you may
kiss the bride chicken or fish
the first dance to a rendition of
“I Will Always Love You” that was
just plain wrong white cake
raspberry filling champagne
and that’s about it

Cam turns and accidentally knocks her fork on the floor She
picks it up and blows on it dusting it off

The Karaoke kicks in again making it almost impossible to
hear the rest of the table But they don’t seem to mind

CAM
I’m Cam I went to college with
the bride

CHARLIE

Charlie Used to date the bride

CAM

Me too

(the table blanches)
Well it was a one-time only
experimental thing in college And
the experiment went horribly awry

(a sip of champagne)
We couldn’t stop giggling

Cam looks Charlie over

CAM (cont’d)
Youre not really her type

CHARLIE
I was thinking the same about you

CAM
Oh the lesbian thing didn’t take
Now I only giggle with boys
(then)
You gonna eat that

Charlie shakes his head and pushes his untouched piece of
wedding cake toward her

CHARLIE
So who are you here with

CAM
No one
(mock offense)
What are you trying to say

CHARLIE
Please my date went home with the
best man
(off her look)
What do you do

CAM
I run the penguin habitat at Sea
World

CHARLIE
Seriously

CAM
No I’m a serial killer and my
MO is that I kill people with my
kung-fu grip
(off Charlie’s smile)
What do you do

CHARLIE
Dentist Not quite as intriguing
as “serial killer”

He deftly slides her his card

CAM
(off the card)
Well at least you get these We
homicidal maniacs don’t usually
carry business cards

She finishes off the last bite of his cake then reaches for
Tracey’s uneaten slice As she leans over she accidentally
DUMPS a LARGE BOWL OF WATER FILLED WITH FLOATING CANDLES into
Charlie’s lap He JUMPS BACK in PAIN from the liquid wax

CHARLIE
(jumping around)
Ahhh Hot Cold Hot Cold

CAM
I am SO sorry

Thoroughly embarrassed Cam helps Charlie clean up the mess
They both sit down -- Charlie squishing into his chair

Awkward moment A little smile comes over Cam’s face

CAM (cont’‘d)

The way you just reacted to that
it totally reminded me of someone

(searching her mind)
I can’t place it It’s right there
on the tip of my tongue

(then)
Oh yeah now I remember

(off his skeptical look)
a six-year-old girl

Charlie nods a “thank you” taking the dig like aman Stu
walks right over to Cam cockily grinning from ear to ear

STU
Well here I am what are your
other two wishes

CHARLIE
(awkward aside)
Um If you hadn‘t noticed I was
in the middle of flirting with Ms
Wexler
STU

If you hadn’t noticed she dumped a
centerpiece in your lap Take the
hint

(turning to Cam)
Hi I’m Dr Stuart Klaminsky But
you can call me Dr Stu

(seeing her wine stain)
You know club soda and salt will
get that out

Charlie continues the introduction

CHARLIE
Cam Stu Stu Cam
(to Cam)
Stu knows about stains because he’s
always covered in blood

CAM
You a serial killer too

STU
Reconstructive surgeon
(false modesty)
If someone has an accident or was
born with a deformity I’m there to
help

CHARLIE
And by deformity he means “small
breasts”

STU
(to Cam)
He’s jealous because he cleans
plaque all day while I’m making the
world a better place

CHARLIE
Because God knows what this world
needs is another stripper with
boobs bigger than her head
(turning to Cam)
Would you like to dance

CAM
(teasing re Stu)
It looks like your dance card is
already full

CHARLIE
Maybe later

CAM
Sorry It was nice meeting you
both

Cam waves to a good-looking man at another table and makes a
quick exit Charlie turns on Stu with a “what the hell is
wrong with you” look But he ignores it looking up at the
other women at the table
STU
Hey are you ladies familiar with
the Guinness Book of World Records

The cheesy KARAOKE SONG being sung on stage cross-dissolves
into a cheesy elevator MUSAK rendition as we

CUT TO

INT DENTAL OFFICE LOBBY - THE NEXT DAY 17

Charlie strides into work As he ENTERS his lobby he sees a
dozen or so women waiting

UPON CLOSER INSPECTION he notices that two of them are from
his wedding table What the hell

PRETTY GIRL 1
Good morning Doctor I think I
have a cavity

Pretty Girl 2 shrugs “Me too”

As he walks slowly toward his office we see that many more

of the women are vaguely familiar -- most were guests at the
wedding
INT STU’S OFFICE - LATER 18

Charlie enters Stu’s waiting room and approaches the desk

CHARLIE
Hi Sharon I need to see Stu
right away

FROM THE BACK we hear Stu
STU (0S)

Yo Chuck Come back here for a
sec

Charlie heads toward the examination room As we follow him
we see a quick glimpse of MICKEY ROURKE in the waiting room

INT EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS 19

Charlie walks into a room with Stu and a TOPLESS BLONDE WITH
GIGANTIC FAKE BREASTS

Charlie starts to step out of the room

CHARLIE
I’m sorry I

sTU
Wait-wait We need you Charlie
this is Pleasure

Charlie tries to avert his eyes while shaking her hand

CHARLIE

Nice to meet you
PLEASURE

The pleasure’s all mine

(then)
Get it The “pleasure” is all
mine My name is Pleasure

CHARLIE
(lost for words)
It’s very clever

STU
We’re looking for a second opinion
What do you think Are they even

Embarrassed Charlie looks over at the mammoth mammaries
They are obscenely large but even
EXT STREET - LATER 20

Walk-and-talk through the streets of San Diego’s historic Gas
Light District Stu and Charlie munch on hot-dogs

CHARLIE
(confused)
So you knew they were even

STU
Of course they were even -- I did
‘em I just wanted you to see ‘em
without buying a lap dance

CHARLIE
How did you get a license to
practice medicine

STU
(playing along)
“License” What do you mean You
need a license

Charlie moves toward Stu conspiratorially
CHARLIE

Listen Have you noticed anything
different about me

STU
Other than your aversion to women’s
breasts

CHARLIE

I don’t have a No I just
women seem to be coming onto me
in an unusual way

STU
Well somebody’s had a full cup of
himself today

Stu looks over Charlie’s shoulder to see CAROL STANDING IN A
SHOP WEARING A WEDDING GOWN She sees the gawking twosome
and steps outside to greet them

She looks much happier than she did while she was ditching
Charlie on the beach

CAROL
Charlie Stuart

CHARLIE
Carol

STU

(re wedding dress)
Are those back in season again

Carol holds out her hand to display a MASSIVE ENGAGEMENT
RING Charlie stares at Carol confused

CHARLIE
Youre getting married
(she nods)
We broke up like a month ago

CAROL
His name is Renaldo We just
clicked What can I say
(she smiles at him)
I guess you are a lucky charm

We go CLOSE ON Charlie as he gets a look of confusion

INT CHARLIE’S PACIFIC BEACH HOUSE - EVENING 21

Charlie walks in the door from work throws his white coat
over a chair and walks to his answering machine

He presses the button

COMPUTER ANSWERING MACHINE
You have fourteen new messages

Message one

WOMAN’S VOICE (ON MACHINE)

Charlie hits PAUSE on the machine and sits stunned

INT PENGUIN HABITAT - NIGHT 22

CLOSE ON -- a bucket of fish Cam dressed in sweats and
water-proof boots dumps the bucket into a tank of swimming
PENGUINS There are literally hundreds of them playing
waddling skidding down a slide into the water

She picks up another pail and scatters it to the stragglers

CAM
(to a penguin)
Hey Grumpy Stop that Leave
Jester alone

She throws a dead fish for Jester in the back Cam reaches
for another bucket -- but there is none

CAM (cont’d)
(calling out)
Joe Shift it into high gear
will ya I want to go home

JOE appears carrying two buckets of fish Meet Cam’s
sullen lethargic little brother He looks to be moving in
slow motion A professional pothead Joe is always one topic
behind any conversation

He wears a T-shirt with WOODY HARRELSON on the front

CAM (cont’‘d)
Did you get lost back there

JOE
Sorry Smoke break

CAM
You know if they catch you with
weed you’re gonna get fired It
doesn’t matter that you’re my
brother

JOE
Re-lax How is anybody gonna know

CAM
Maybe the hemp pants Or the hemp
shirt Or the fact that you smell
like you showered in bong water

Joe holds out the buckets of herring for her
23 pt

JOE
(reminiscent)
When I was in college I made a
bong out of a dried blow-fish

CAM
You never went to college

JOE
Well I never enrolled But I sold
a ton of shit at Stanford

Cam playfully throws a fish at him and finishes dumping the
last bucket into the water As she turns she accidentally
trips on the SECOND BUCKET

Cam TUMBLES on the top of the PENGUIN SLIDE and starts to
SLIP DOWN the chute -- arms flapping holding fish She
saves herself at the last moment standing on the edge of the
ice Whew

JOE (cont‘d)
(chortling)
And you think I look wasted

At the top of the slide Cam looks up to see a Penguin eyeing
the fish in her hands Her smile fades

CAM
Wait Grumpy no

Too late -- Grumpy dives down the slide and BOWLING BALLS
into Cam Her feet flip out from under her and she does a
FACE PLANT against the rock and SINKS INTO THE WATER

The accident is half-tragichalf-hysterical Joe rushes (as
fast as a stoned stoner can rush) to the edge of the water

JOE
Whoa Murphy that was radical

Cam surfaces holding her mouth
CAM
I think I chipped a tooth
INT CHARLIE’S CLASSIC CONVERTIBLE T-BIRD - NIGHT 23 pt
The car door opens and a pretty young thing named NICOLE sits

down in the passenger seat demurely She dolls herself up as
Charlie walks around the car The TOP IS DOWN

The driver’s side door opens and Charlie SITS A beat

NICOLE
Do these seats go down

CHARLIE
Pardon

But she’s not waiting She pounces climbing over the stick
shift and on top of him Her butt accidentally JAMS INTO THE
HORN -- HOOOOONKKKKK

She starts to take off her top

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Wait Don’t you want to

NICOLE
(removing her bra)
What

CHARLIE
I don’t know have dinner first

NICOLE
Is that how it works

Charlie gently pulls away looking into her eyes

CHARLIE
How what works

NICOLE
You know the thing
(off Charlie’s blank look)
The thing the magic the charm
the spell

She immediately attacks him again The front seat is tiny
Her foot brushes the windshield wiper and FLUID SPRAYS OVER
THE WINDOW DOUSING THEM

OUTSIDE THE CAR -- we watch as the HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON
SEVERAL TIMES from the flailing body parts Suddenly the
car STARTS TO ROLL DOWN THE HILL AND ONTO A NEIGHBORS’ YARD

INSIDE THE CAR -- Charlie pulls up the emergency brake and
pulls off the girl

CHARLIE
Whoah whoah whoah slow down --
what the hell are you talking
about
A beat

NICOLE
(thinking he knows)
You’re a lucky charm You have sex
with somebody and then they find
their true love Isn’t that how it
works

CHARLIE
Has everybody completely lost their
minds That’s ridiculous That’s
absurd

NICOLE
Do you want top or bottom

CHARLIE
Wait I really don’t want to take
advantage of you

NICOLE

Look don’t take it so seriously
Im certainly not I’m doing this
on a lark

(then)
And you won’t be taking advantage
of me Do you know how many loser
boyfriends I’ve had Do you know
how many times I’ve given myself --
body mind and soul -- hoping that
this was the one this was it this
was my soulmate only to find that
he was just some jerk-off asshole
who was more interested in sleeping
with my best friend and ready to
dump me because he “can’t see
daylight between my thighs”

(then excited)
If there’s a chance even a point-
zero-zero-zero-zero-one percent
chance that you’re the key that
being with you might open the door
to something better -- well I
think I’d be taking advantage of
you

CHARLIE
Would you like to have sex before
or after dinner

NICOLE
Why don’t we work up an appetite

Boul-ya They start to kiss passionately when Charlie’s
phone RINGS

CHARLIE

She gets out of the car and leans in

Reba SITTING ON HIS COUCH in an overcoat

REBA
Hi Dr Kagan

Charlie is startled

CHARLIE
Reba What the hell

REBA
Sorry I didn’t mean to scare you
I used the key you left me in case
of emergencies

Charlie puts his coat down and turns on another light A
long beat Reba doesn’t move Finally

dumbfounded)
(MORE)

REBA (contd)
Somebody posted about you on my
internet dating site

CHARLIE
Wait a second This is totally out
of control It’s not true

REBA
That’s what I thought But then I
went to Urban-Legends—Dot-Com and
nobody has disproved it
(then random)
Did you know that Walt Disney was
cremated and not frozen

CHARLIE
Reba I’1l1 see you on Monday

REBA
(changing tact)
Dr Kagan you’ve always been there
for me

CHARLIE
(clarifying)
When you need a day off yes When
you need a lift to work yes

REBA
When Reggie died four years ago
you sent that beautiful card
Remember what you wrote
(recalling)
“If there’s anything I can do
please let me know”

CHARLIE
(flustered)
Yes but
REBA

(matter-of-factly)
Well I’m letting you know

Reba throws off her coat to REVEAL that she’s wearing LACY
GARTERS and a BUSTIER that could hold up a house She starts
to stalk him around the living room He backs away

CHARLIE
This is not what I had in mind

REBA
These panties are edible But I’d
avoid the tush area as I’ve been
sitting for about three hours

CHARLIE
Reba I’m not the guy for you

REBA
I’m not saying you are But the
next guy might be If we’re
together I’1l find my soul mate

CHARLIE
That’s ridiculous

Reba starts to cry This big strong woman is reduced to a
sobbing wreck within a matter of seconds

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Wait wait Please don’t cry

Charlie moves to comfort her but she uses the opportunity to
pounce on him It was all an act

CHARLIE (cont’d)
I can’t do this

REBA
Don’t worry I’ll do everything

She starts to remove his shirt Resistance is futile
REBA (contd)
Please Just close your eyes and

imagine somebody beautiful

This stops Charlie dead in his tracks He lifts Reba’s face
so that he looks into her eyes

CHARLIE
(gently)
I’ll imagine you No one but you

Kindly he kisses her lips

EXT DRIVING RANGE - DAY 33

Charlie and Stu practice Stu SWINGS and side-swipes the
ball It ricochets off the wood protective panelling and
shoots back almost decapitating him

STU
(surprised)
Reba You slept with Reba

CHARLIE
Shhhh Quiet down

Charlie hits a long straight perfect drive

STU
You’re telling me that you’ve got
the power to turn any hot chick
into a knob-gobbling lance waxing
fleshmonger and you’re ploughing
the back forty with Reba

Stu SLICES another ball -- It hits the fence 90 degrees to
the right Somebody ducks

CHARLIE
You don’t understand because you
weren’t there

STU
(pointing conspicuously)
Check it That is the kind of tail
you should be chasin’

The PASSING FEMALE GOLFER he refers to is GORGEOUS

STU (cont’d)
I’d suck a fart out of her ass and
hold it like a bong hit

Charlie hits a long straight perfect drive Stu hits
another ball that ricochets off his ball bucket and bounces
BEHIND HIM

CHARLIE
(re Stu’s swing)
Have you thought about wearing
protective gear

Charlie hits another ball Stu tries to bounce a ball on his
club like Tiger Woods He never makes contact

STU
Dude Let me get this straight
They all think you’re a lucky
charm Carol said it Katie said
it at the wedding
CHARLIE
That’s what they tell me

STU
So according to them every girl
youve ever bumped uglies with has
gotten married to the next guy she
dates after you

CHARLIE
It’s not true

STU

Who the hell cares if its true
Wake up man You got it made
What’s the only thing that all
women want

(Charlie doesn’t answer)
To get married Raise rug-rats

(then)
And apparently you hold the
ticket to the big show Do you
know what this means Trim
You’re gonna be seein’ trim like
Tommy Lee Like Colin Farrell
Like Ellen DeGeneres

CHARLIE
Have you considered the possibility
that the reason you haven’t had sex
in this decade has something to do
with your routine use of the word
“trim”

STU
(ignoring him)
Chicks 24 hours a day 7 days a
week 56 weeks a year Boul-ya

CHARLIE
You and I are different Okay
Besides me not being retarded I
don’t want to take advantage

STU
Was Martin Luther King Jr taking
advantage when he said that
thing at the place I don’t think
so Was Ghandi taking advantage
when he you know did his thing
Don‘t tell me Ghandi didn’t score
some sweet Native American trim

CHARLIE
Ghandi was Indian

STU
They don’t like to be called that
(he swings and misses a
ball entirely)
Seriously dude I thought you
wanted to find love

CHARLIE
I do

STU
Well stop dipping your foot in the
pool and dive the fuck in

Charlie looks up to see the gorgeous Female Golfer checking

him out

STU (cont’d)
And think about this you’d be
providing a much needed public
service You’d be helping women
find love

Charlie shakes his head and chuckles at Stu’s idiocy

STU (cont‘d)
Don’t bitch to me that you haven’t
found Miss Right if you’ve got
women lining up for the position
and you turning your back on them

Charlie nods his you know he might be right

STU (cont’d)
You know I’m right So go on
already
(re Female Golfer)
-take one for the team

Stu lines up his next shot

STU (cont’d)
Do you need a good pick-up line
Because I could help with that
Ask her if it hurt when she fell
from heaven Or tell her

Stu realizes Charlie is no longer there He looks around to
find him talking to the Female Golfer He smiles satisfied
then hits another ball SMASHING the snack bar window

CHARLIE
(playful)
I’m okay with that I’m really
just looking for a physical
relationship anyway

CAM
So I’ve heard

Cam follows the jab with a curt smile

CHARLIE
Wait That wasn’t serious That’s
not how I feel at all
(sinking ship)
You know what I’m sorry Really
no problem I get it I do

She smiles and walks into the elevator and out of his life

EXT SEA WORLD - DAY 49

Establishing Dolphins jump through hoops Children pick up
starfish Shamu splashes the folks in the front row

INT PENGUIN HABITAT - DAY 50

The observation room A long conveyer belt slowly motors
people along in front of a giant glass tank Penguins swim
and waddle on the other side

Cam stands in front of the conveyer with a microphone As
the people pass she gives an informative speech

CAM
During the Antarctic winter
temperatures average negative 76
degrees The winds howl at speeds
of up to 200 miles per hour

As she talks WE SEE Charlie rounding the bend munching on
popeorn

CAM (contd)
Emperor penguins are the only
species that can breed during these
winter conditions

Cam looks down to see Charlie on the conveyer belt He
smiles up at her She falters momentarily but continues

CAM (cont’‘d)

The female lays a single egg then
rolls it onto the feet of the male
The male stands and incubates the
egg until it hatches -- about 65
days Having built up a thick
layer of fat to sustain him through
the long winter he never leaves
the egg to hunt for food The
female who spends the entire
incubation period foraging in the
ocean returns before the chick
hatches

(finishing)
You can find out more about the
Emperor Penguin at one of the many
information kiosks If you have
any questions please feel free to
ask

She puts the microphone down and hops over the conveyer belt
moving toward Charlie As she goes she knocks the
microphone over -- it falls into the gear of the conveyor
belt and -- HORRIBLE SCREECH -- SNAPS the microphone cord
While trying to rescue the cable she snaps one heel off her
shoe

Charlie can’t help but laugh Cam tries to act like nothing
happened -- she hobbles over to him

CAM (cont‘d)
What are you doing here

CHARLIE
Learning about the Emperor Penguin
Having some popcorn

CAM
Seriously

CHARLIE

Seriously So the male Emperor
Penguin really lives off his own
fat for 65 days to protect the egg

(she nods)
Youd think the female could bring
him back a tuna-burger or
something

CAM
Why are you really here

CHARLIE
Okay I don’t buy the “I’m not
emotionally available” It’s weak

Are you dying Do you not want to
get involved because you don’t want
to hurt me when you die

CAM
I’m not dying

CHARLIE
Good Me neither Am I not your
type Because I can live with that

CAM
I think you should go

CHARLIE
(holding up his ticket)
I paid fifty-eight dollars to see
you today I’11 leave if you pay
me back

VOICE (0S)
(cutting her off)
Is this the dude

Cam spins to find her stoner brother Joe approaching
without a shirt on He saunters over and starts to eat some
of Charlie’s popcorn without asking

CAM
No thank you Joe this
isn’tCharlie this is my brother
Joe

CHARLIE
(suddenly excited)
What Have you been talking about
me
(to Joe)
Has she been talking about me

CAM JOE
No I haven’t Yup You the dentist

CHARLIE (cont’d)
So I am the dude

CAM
(to Charlie)
I mentioned you in passing I said
you were funny

JOE
And you said--

CAM
(cutting him off)
And I said you were charming and
good-looking and had a nice smile

CHARLIE
That explains why we’re not dating

CAM
(to Joe)
Why aren’t you wearing a shirt

JOE
What are you talking about

He looks down and realizes he’s topless This starts a
stoner-giggle that goes on longer than it should

A LITTLE GIRL approaches tugging on Cam’s pant leg

LITTLE GIRL
Excuse me Miss How come the
momma penguin doesn’t bring back
food for the poppa penguin

Cam bends down to the Little Girl

CAM
The male penguin doesn’t need food

CHARLIE
(helping)
He’d rather live off his own fat

The Little Girl seems appeased and wanders away

CHARLIE (cont’d)
I know this comes out of left
field but I was hoping to take you
to dinner

JOE
She’d love to

CAM
Joe say another word and I hide
your stash

CHARLIE
Tell you what -- you can eat and
Ill just sit and digest my own

lard

Careful not to say another word Joe offers Charlie a nod of
encouragement After fielding an evil look from Cam he
turns and heads through a door marked “EMPLOYEES ONLY”

CAM
Look you’re charming you’re
funny you’re successful and
cliché of clichés -- you help
underprivileged kids It’s just
that I know three girls that youve
gone out with I’m not into dating
as a sport

Cam walks away Charlie follows
CHARLIE

Wait you said if anybody had any
questions don’t hesitate to ask

CAM
No No no no I’m not going to
go out with you No Don’t ask

CHARLIE
That wasn’t my question
(then)
My question was
(random)
-what kind of penguin is that

Charlie points to a cute little PENGUIN behind the glass
speeds along in the water like a water ballerina

CAM

(pointedly)
It’s a Gentoo One of several
species of Penguin that is
completely monogamous

(double meaning)
I hope that answers your question

(then)
And interestingly enough penguins
are also unique in that mate
selection is up to the female

CHARLIE
Much like in our relationship

CAM
Why do you want to take me to
dinner so badly

CHARLIE
You look hungry

CAM
Really

CHARLIE

(a moment)
Because you kind of remind me of
these penguins

She waits for an explanation as Charlie watches a waddling
little penguin trip and do a face-plant into the ice

CHARLIE (cont’d)
On land outside they’re kind of
awkward and goofy

That was a compliment

It

CHARLIE (cont’d)
But in the water they’ve got this
incredible grace and speed
They’re like God’s perfect
creatures

Cam is touched She doesn’t quite know what to say Then

CAM
Okay

CHARLIE
Okay what

CAM
Okay dinner

CHARLIE
Really

CAM
Okay

Charlie gives a thumbs up to Joe who now watches intently
from behind the glass in the penguin tank (arms crossed
shivering in the intense cold) Even the penguins who are
flanking him look happy to hear the news

CAM (contd)
But only as friends If you have
to know I’m very serious about
someone else

CHARLIE
Youre dating someone
CAM
Well no We haven’t exactly

met yet

She steps over and pulls a book off the shelf from the gift
shop All the books on the shelf topple to the ground She
acts as if it didn’t happen turning the book over to show
Charlie the cover A picture of the writer HOWARD BLAINE

CAM (contd)
He’s the foremost expert on
penguins in the world I’1l be
meeting him at a conference later
this year

CHARLIE

And I do not want to interfere with
that

(a beat then)
Actually I really really want to
interfere But okay a date As
friends Just give me a chance
that’s all I’m asking for

She nods They face each other silently for a moment

CAM
What you said about “God’s perfect
creature” that was easily the
nicest thing anyone has ever said
to me

CHARLIE
(playful smile)
I was exaggerating a bit

Cam grins and heads back off to work

She moves to open the door but it is LOCKED ruining her
perfect exit Charlie hides his smile She totters off in
the other direction

INT STU’S OFFICE - LATER 51

Stu is closing up shop as Charlie follows him around like an
excited puppy dog

STU
“Perfectly imperfect” What the
hell does that mean

CHARLIE
(searching)
I don’t know Haven’t you ever
fallen for somebody’s flaws

STU
I’m a plastic surgeon I see a
flaw and I pour spackle over it

Charlie gets all warm thinking about her

CHARLIE
(goofy grin)
She’‘s not very nice to me
(then)
And she likes somebody else

STU
Score

Stu holds up a glass jar with some floating whitish-reddish
gunk in it

CHARLIE
What is that

STU
(big smile)
It’s what I’m gonna retire on my

friend

Stu opens a locked cabinet and places the jar on the shelf
next to two dozen other glass jars filled with different odd-
looking artifacts

STU (cont‘d)
I’m gonna sell all this shit on
Ebay for mad cash

Stu holds up a glass jar with two plastic implants in it

STU (cont’d)
Pamela Lee’s breast implants

CHARLIE
What Why aren’t they implanted in
her breasts

STU
She came in for a reduction These
are what I took out

CHARLIE
(incredulous)
You saved them

STU
You know how much some sick dude is
gonna pay for these

Holding up the bottle of whitish-reddish gunk

STU (cont’d)
Mira Sorvino’s thigh fat

CHARLIE
Get out of here
STU
I’m serious It’s the cellulite
from her left inner thigh

CHARLIE
That’s disgusting
(morbidly fascinated)
What else do you have

STU

(pointing to each one)
Jennifer Grey’s septum Michael
Douglas’ droopy eye-lid Burt
Reynolds’ neck skin Joan Rivers
Joan Rivers Joan Rivers Tori
Spelling’s nose shavings and the
coup de grace Jennifer Connelly’s
breast reduction

CHARLIE
It looks like Mira Sorvino’s inner
thigh

STU

Don’t be stupid That’s bona fide
Jennifer Connelly boob

Stu closes and locks up the cabinet with great care
brings the conversation back around again

STU (cont’d)
So Charlie’s got a crush

CHARLIE
It’s not a crush I can’t explain
it but she’s the one When I’m
with her I feel like the stars are
all lined up

STU
So since you’re out of play you
wont mind if I call up some of
your ex-girlfriends

CHARLIE
(irked)
Can I just say I’m an idiot for
taking your advice “Public
service” All I succeeded in doing

by being with all those women is to
push my soulmate further away

He

STU
Might I remind you that you also
got your axle greased a fair amount
in the process

CHARLIE
What’s sex without love

STU
(answering)
Sex It’s still sex Jesus
Christ I’ve never met anyone so
bummed to squirt out a little baby
gravy

Charlie shoots him a look -- “don’t talk like that”

STU (cont’d)
(dumbfounded)
Have you even kissed this girl yet
(Charlie shakes his head)
And you’re going cold turkey for
her

CHARLIE
If she wants me more like a Gentoo
then I’m going to be more like a
Gentoo

STU
You lost me

CHARLIE
A Gentoo is a monogamous penguin

STU
Did you go off your meds

Charlie EXITS Stu’s office and walks through the waiting room
filled with beautiful buxom women -- but Charlie doesn’t even
notice He just shrugs back to Stu with a goofy smile

As we follow him out (like in the earlier scene) we see a
quick glimpse of GARY BUSEY in the waiting room

EXT LA JOLLA COVE - LATER 52

Cam and Charlie walk down the moonlit beach focused more on
each other than the crashing waves and strolling lovers
around them
CAM
Do sharks get cavities

CHARLIE
No

CAM
You have no idea do you

Charlie shakes his head caught

CHARLIE
Isn‘t the point of 100 questions to
ask personal questions To learn
about the other person

CAM

I’ve learned that you don’t know
the average birth weight of an
African Dik-Dik I think that’s
just important as you knowing my
favorite food is soup

(then)
Okay your question

CHARLIE
Why penguins

CAM
Why teeth

CHARLIE
My question I asked first

CAM
Lots of reasons For one you
can’t help but smile when you see a
penguin

CHARLIE
Another trait they share with you

CAM
Their world Antarctica is
beautiful I go there once a year
for research Because of the
Earth’s axis there’s only one
sunrise and one sunset a year You
don’t know beauty until you’ve seen
a once-a-year sunset in Antarctica

CHARLIE
(taking her in)
I don’t know about that

She blushes a little A nice moment

CAM
And their rituals are fascinating

CHARLIE
Penguin rituals

Charlie’s cell phone RINGS He silences it immediately

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Sorry

CAM

(nodding)
Rituals Like when a male penguin
is sweet on a female he goes ona
long search across the beach to
find the perfect pebble to offer
her He hunts everywhere to find
it Finally he waddles over and
presents the stone by placing it at
her webbed feet If she accepts
his offer they will be life-long
mates

CHARLIE
Like an engagement ring

CAM
(nodding)
It’s unbelievable to watch

They quietly pass a couple of teenagers making out in the

sand

CHARLIE
I have a feeling that you’re a very
good kisser I mean Ive already
spent an hour and a half inside
your mouth so I should know

CAM
(playful)
What makes you think I’1l be
kissing you
(then)
(MORE)

CAM (contd)
Might I remind you that with
penguins mate selection is up to
the female

Cam who’s been looking at Charlie walks face first into a
wooden pier plank She falls back to the sand

CHARLIE
(falling to his knees)
You alright

CAM
Ow

He leans in He kisses her head Cheek They touch lips
Gentle Soft A perfect kiss He pulls away slowly and

CHARLIE
Yeah maybe I was wrong about the
“very good kisser” thing

She laughs loudly and tackles him into the sand She starts
to walk away in mock offense

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Hey I’m sorry Everybody has
something they’re good at I’m
sure we’ll find yours

He starts to chase her down as we
MONTAGE -- Through a number of dates

-- They stand against the rail watching the rippling wates3
as they snuggle aboard the Bahia Belle a Mississippi-style
stern wheeler that cruises Mission Bay

CAM
Okay so fess up about this charm

CHARLIE
You know about it
(she nods “of course”)
And what do you think

CAM
I think it’s a pretty creative way
to get laid

-- Holding hands while walking through the Prado area in 54
Balboa Park taking in the sublime Spanish Moor Architecture

-- Picnicking on the grass in front of the gigantic bouldesd5
torso of the BEAR SCULPTURE at UCSD

-- Dining at Bertand’s at Mister A’s and watching the 56
cityscape from it’s panoramic view She opens a beautifully
wrapped gift REVEAL that he’s bought her a “LO-JACK”

-- Finally we find our two STOMPING GRAPES and making win®7
at the Julian Grape Stomp Fest It’s only a matter of
seconds before it turns into a dunking contest where both are
losers This leads us to

EXT THE CITY OF JULIAN - NIGHT 58

Charlie and Cam share a CARRIAGE RIDE in the beautiful town
outside of San Diego that is nestled in the Cuyamaca
Mountains

But they aren’t seeing any of it making out like two school-
kids in the back of the carriage Charlie’s hands go for the
bra clasp He fumbles around for what seems like an
eternity

CAM
First time

Charlie is shivering almost imperceptibly It’s unclear if
the cause is the crisp air or the moment

CHARLIE
With you it almost feels like it

Her smile warms him

With a mischievous grin Cam takes her bra off under her
shirt She holds it out for him

CAM
I think you were looking for this

Charlie is speechless In the blink of an eye he’s Woody
Allen

CHARLIE
So you’re okay with us you
know getting a little more

CAM
(frisky)
Do I need to provide written
instructions

Charlie quickly turns to the driver of the carriage

CHARLIE
Um we’ll be getting off here

CAM
(sotto suggestively)
Yes you will

The two love-birds stumble out of the coach and immediately
disappear into the nearby Cuyamaca park already starting to
remove each other’s clothes

RING His cell phone goes off It’s a DIFFERENT SOUNDING
RING this time

CHARLIE
This is not happening
CAM
Turn it off
CHARLIE
It’s the emergency line I’m

sorry
(peeling her off of him)
I promise I’ll make it fast

Charlie roots through his pants and finds the ringing cell
phone He moves away to answer it

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Dr Kagan speaking

INTERCUT STU IN HIS APARTMENT

STU
Dude

One word and Charlie already knows who it is

CHARLIE
This better be an emergency

STU

Charlie looks over to Cam who is now stretched out on some
rocks Her hands aren’t waiting for Charlie to come back

She enjoys giving him a show

CHARLIE
I’m hanging up now

STU
Wait Have you boned her yet

CHARLIE
Goodbye

STU
Fine if you wanna lose Cam

CHARLIE
(taking the bait)
What are you talking about

sTU
That charm thing Turns out it’s a
curse I’m telling you you shake
the sheets with Cam she’s going to
marry the next person she dates

CHARLIE
We both know that’s bullshit

Twenty yards away Cam moans

CAM
(calling out writhing)
I hope there’s some left for you
when you get back

STU

Yeah Well I started calling your
exes to take the Hummer on a little
bush patrol if you know what I
mean

(then)
And they’re married Every single
one you closed the deal with

CHARLIE
Impossible

STU
Youd think so right But youd

school newsletter Kari Lizer

CHARLIE
What The girl I lost my virginity

sTU

Did you see who she wound up
marrying Bobby Romanus That
douchebag she dumped you for

Charlie is silent

TOTALLY NAKED and grinning ear to ear She gives a playful
wave

CHARLIE

I hate you I really really hate
you

dubious look)

door A hand UNLOCKS the door Cam enters and plops down on
the couch next to him looking disappointed

JOE
Forgot your keys again

She nods pulling her bra out of her pocket

CAM
Didn’t know you were here

JOE

How’‘d your date go

CAM
It could have gone better
(vexed)
He’s playing hard to get

JOE
How are you playing it

CAM
I dry-humped a hitching post in
front of him

Cam sinks further into her chair and grabs the bag of Bugles

JOE
So what’s the biggie I thought
you weren’t into this guy

CAM
Me either It’s just the way he
looks at me sometimes When I’m
around him I feel like we’re the
only ones there You know

Halfway through the scene we see Cam detach a VIDEO CAMERA
from its tripod and smile over to Charlie

CAM
I think we need a well-documented
historical record of this
monumental occasion How about
you

Charlie nods like a puppy dog Of course he’s game

-- Our couple takes turns with the camera as the scene
continues to be beautifully shot and scored Think “9 12
Weeks” meets “Red Shoe Diaries” Back-lit Primary colored
lights wash over their gorgeous bodies

As the MUSIC FADES we DISSOLVE to them in bed together
Snuggled in a stop-the-hands-of-time embrace

A poetic moment
Then both of them rise up quickly with excitement

CAM CHARLIE
I can’t wait any longer Put in the tape Put in the
tape

Cam quickly attaches a cable to the TV jumps back into bed
with the remote and presses PLAY

CLOSE ON THEIR FACES as they watch the screen They each
simultaneously tilt their heads to the side trying to
decipher the image

CAM (cont’‘d)
Is that my nipple

CHARLIE
(shaking his head slowly)
I think it’s a pimple on my back

After a moment they both get a look of HORROR on their faces
and RUSH TO TURN OFF THE TAPE

CHARLIE CAM
Turn it off good God turn We’ve made a terrible
it off mistake
INT CAM’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 75

Cam sleeps peacefully Charlie next to her gazing at her
perfect face Lit by the flicker of the television

A gentle moment Then
CAM
(without opening her eyes)
Stop looking at me Youre
freakin’ me out

Charlie smiles warmly and rolls over On the TV a LOCAL
NEWS PROGRAM is on The CHYRON reads “OBESITY IN AMERICA”

There are quick shots of FAT PEOPLE as a reporter talks to
the camera (the sound muted)

SUDDENLY Charlie’s face fills with panic He moves for the
TIVO remote and hits PAUSE

REVERSE BACK BACK BACK STOP

On the SCREEN -- a PAUSED IMAGE that is clearly ELEANOR
SKEPPLE --— KISSING A HEFTY MAN

CHARLIE
Oh my God
INT CAM’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 76
Charlie paces and whispers loudly into his phone

CHARLIE
Wake up Wake up Wake up

INTERCUT -- Stu picking up the phone in his bed

STU
(half-asleep)
Hello
CHARLIE
(controlling his panic)
“The deed is done” “The deed is

done”
STU
It’s five o’clock in the morning
What are you talking about

CHARLIE
The deed I’m talking about the
deed I thought you went out with
Eleanor Skepple

STU
Naw I just said that

CHARLIE

CAM’S VOICE (0S)
(from the other room)
Charlie Is everything okay

CHARLIE
(shielding phone)
Everything’s fine sweetie I’11l
be back in a minute
(into phone incredulous)
You just “said that”

STU
I didn’t want to risk it Marrying
her

CHARLIE
I saw you with her You asked her
out

STU
No I asked her what time it was
It was 352

CHARLIE
I can’t believe I trusted you You
are no longer my friend

STU
Can I still pretend to be you

CHARLIE
No You can’t be me I’mme I
never want to talk to you again
Ever Ever ever

STU
Youre really going to let a girl
come between us

CHARLIE
Not a girl The girl
(then definitively)
And now I’m going to lose her

Charlie slams down the phone as his words hang in the air

He takes a deep breath Shakes his head sadly and
contemplates for a beat The wheels start to turn in his
head Sadness turns to anger which turns to steely resolve
He starts to psych himself up

CHARLIE (cont’d)
(determined)
No I’m not going to lose her

PUSH INTO Charlie’s crazed eyes

INT CAM’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING 77

CLOSE ON Cam who is sleeping soundly A cup of coffee comes
into frame and is swirled about A smile comes over her

CAM
Mmmm breakfast in bed

Her eyes open as we PULL OUT to REVEAL that it is TRULY
BREAKFAST IN BED The entire bed is filled with food

It looks like she woke up in the middle of the Bellagio
buffet in Vegas Scrambled eggs omelettes fried eggs
bacon sausage biscuits toast muffins pancakes waffles
crepes every imaginable kind of juice etc

Cam is taken aback

CHARLIE
Good morning

CAM
Am I supposed to eat my way out

CHARLIE
I just thought you’d like a little
breakfast

CAM
(a little confused)
Thank you

She sits up (careful not to spill anything) and picks up a

piece of toast She looks over to Charlie who looks a
little tweaked

Cam nods

CAM (cont’‘d)
Are you okay

CHARLIE
Couldn’t be happier You okay

She studies him for a moment

CAM
You’re acting kind of strange

CHARLIE
I’m not acting strange

He sits down on the edge of the bed trying to look natural
Cam just looks at him “What the hell is going on”

Cam looks

CHARLIE (cont’d)
So what do you want to do today

CAM
Well I’ve got to go to work

CHARLIE
Right Of course Work Me too
(then)
How about Saturday night Or
Sunday Say Wednesday

CAM

EXT STREET - MORNING

Stu and Charlie brave the morning traffic to walk to work

Charlie dials his cell phone and waits for an answer

(MORE)

CHARLIE (INTO PHONE) (contd)

Charlie flips the phone off Stu looks over to him wanting
to say something but doesn’t

A beat later Charlie flips the phone open again and dials

Before Charlie finishes saying “Bye” again Stu rips the
phone out of his hand drops it on the floor and STOMPS ON
IT AGGRESSIVELY The phone shatters into a million pieces
After a beat Stu continues walking
STU
Youre welcome

INT CAM’S WORK - PENGUIN HABITAT - AFTERNOON 79

Cam opens the door to her office to find the room FILLED WITH
A ZILLION FLOWERS She wades through them to find a card
It reads “Miss you already Charlie”

A stoned Joe shuffles up behind her

JOE
(flat)
Is there something different in
here since lunch

Cam opens the closet to hang her jacket as HUNDREDS OF RED
HELIUM BALLOONS ESCAPE FROM THE LITTLE ROOM AND FLOAT TO THE
CEILING

Every single one of them is shaped like a HEART

CAM
(softly)
What the he--

There is a KNOCK ON THE DOOR Cam goes to it FOUR MEN IN
TUXES STAND AT THE DOOR

One of them blows on a tuning harmonica and then in perfect
harmony they sing a barbershop quartet version of Beyonce’s
Crazy in Love”

SINGING QUARTET

(singing)
I look and stare so deep in your
eyes I touch on you more and more
every time When you leave Im
beggin’ you not to go Call your
name two three times in a row

(they start lame

choreography )
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now
Your loves got me lookin’ so crazy

Joe and Cam just stare at the quartet in silence Then

JOE
Hey -- you guys do Free Bird
EXT PARKING LOT - SEA WORLD - LATER THAT DAY 80

Cam makes her way toward her car As she approaches she
slows a look of dismay materializing on her face

PIVOT to REVEAL Cam’s car Tin cans are tied to the back
bumper and there are hearts and written in soap all over the
car On the back window a big sign reading “ALMOST
MARRIED

EXT OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER 81

A ball of nerves Charlie bursts out of his office door (we
see that his name-plate is missing for some reason)

He walks across the hallway to Stu’s office As he opens the

door he stops momentarily to notice that his own name plate
has been duct-tapped on top of Stu’s Hmmmm

INT STU’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 82

Charlie comes barging into Stu’s office Stu is knee-deep
into some heavy-petting with a BLONDE

STU
(sweet talking)
If you were a hamburger at
McDonald’s I’d name you
McBeautiful

CHARLIE
Stu I need you It’s important

STU
(covering)
Hmmm My name is Dr Charlie
Kagan I don’t know who this Stu
is that you speak of

Charlie doesn’t want to waste any time He takes out his
wallet and shows his DRIVERS LICENSE to the blonde

She immediately SLAPS STU and storms out of the office

STU (cont’d)
(calling after her)
I’1l call you

Charlie closes the door and locks it

CHARLIE
I need your help

STU
With what

CHARLIE
I’ve been thinking Cam is going
to fall in love and get married to
the next guy that she dates
(MORE)

CHARLIE (contd)
(off Stu’s blank stare)
I’m going to be that guy

STU
You lost me at “hello”

CHARLIE
(explaining)
You’re a plastic surgeon You’re
going to completely change my face
to make me look like a different
person Then Ill be the next
person she falls in love with

STU
Charlie in the history of bad
ideas that falls somewhere in
between New Coke and JFK saying
“let’s take the convertible”

CHARLIE
So you’re not going to help me

STU
Yes by not rearranging your face
(sitting him down)
Get a grip man There’s got to be
another way

A long beat Then a look of enlightenment washes over
Charlie’s face

CHARLIE
Why hadn’t I thought of it before

STU
(facetiously)
What Time machine Clone her

CHARLIE
Ill just follow her around and
keep her from meeting another guy

Stu just stares at him Then

STU
The plastic surgery was a better
idea

CHARLIE
(unhinged)
I just have to buy myself some time
till I figure out how to reverse
the curse

EXT CAM’S APARTMENT - MORNING 83

A stake-out Charlie has a donut and coffee in his car He
sees Cam EXIT her apartment Charlie ducks in his seat
SPILLING his coffee on his lap Ouch

He watches as Cam gets into her car

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY 84

Cam driving down the highway at a healthy clip SUDDENLY
behind her a POLICE CAR flashes its lights

Cams car pulls over Behind them in the distance we see
Charlie pulling over as well

INT CHARLIE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 85

Charlie hovers down behind his steering wheel spying

CHARLIE’S POV -- we watch as a MUSCULAR POLICEMAN steps
out of his car
CHARLIE
(losing it)

Oh no This isn’t good

CHARLIE’S POV -- the strapping Officer strides toward
Cam’s car

CHARLIE (cont’d)
It’s over Game over Party’s
over
EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS 86

The Officer knocks on Cam’s window She rolls it down

OFFICER
License and registration please

CAM
Yes officer

Cam hands the policeman her information

SUDDENLY FROM BEHIND a car (Charlie’s car) COMES SCREAMING
PAST HONKING ITS HORN AND BREAKING THE SOUND BARRIER

CHARLIE
(screaming out the window)

Without missing a beat the Officer hands Cam back her
documents and rushes back to his car to take pursuit

Cam looks at the speeding car with concerned confusion

CAM
Charlie

CUT TO

INT COUNTY JAIL - LATER 87

Charlie sits in a cell with a few drunk-and-disorderlies A
guard approaches the cell

GUARD
Charles Kagan You made bail

EXT COUNTY JAIL - MOMENTS LATER 88

Charlie and Stu step out of the jail building and into the
POURING RAIN

STU
So how’s the plan working out for
you so far

CHARLIE
(dispirited)
Thanks for bailing me out
(then)
What are you up to tonight

STU
Masturbating
(then)
Oh and then I gotta go see my
cousin He found out last week
that he’s got an inoperable tumor

CHARLIE
That’s horrible

sTU
Yeah he’s got like one week to
live

CHARLIE
That’s perfect He’s perfect
for her

Stu stops in his tracks and stares at Charlie

STU
No No no no

CHARLIE
What’s the harm He gets laid
She falls in love He’s dead
inside a week I swoop in to
console her Bim bam boom
everybodys happy

Stu just shakes his head in disgust and starts to walk away

CHARLIE (cont’d)
What hospital is he at
(then)
What I just want to send
flowers

Stu turns on him

STU
Charlie snap out of it okay If
you love this girl go tell her
Live happily ever after Just
avoid going nuts while you do it

Charlie nods and mouths “Thank You” and starts away

STU (contd)
(calling after him)
I doubt she’s had time to file a
restraining order

INT PENGUIN HABITAT - LATER 89
Charlie walks in and starts looking for Cam He rides the
people-mover conveyer belt Two penguins bat a balloon back

and forth but Cam is nowhere to be found

Charlie sees Joe in the tank feeding the birds He moves to
the glass and knocks When Joe looks up Charlie waves

Joe approaches the window and points to a sign that reads
“Please don’t knock on glass” Joe goes back to work

Charlie glances into the gift shop Still no Cam He sees a
book on the shelf with Howard’s big smiling mug on it Ugh
From out of his pocket he pulls an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX He
glances inside -- yup just as we expected an engagement
ring Not good He fingers it for a moment and then re-
pockets the box

FINALLY he sees Cam enter the far end of the Penguin Tank
She’s wearing a DIVE SUIT

TRIUMPHANT LOVE MUSIC SWELLS as Charlie runs toward the
window -- he is about to bang on the glass (in a total “The
Graduate” moment) when he remembers the sign “Please Don’t
Knock on Glass”

BETTER IDEA

Charlie sees a woman applying lipstick next to him He takes
the lipstick out of her hand and jumps up on the PEOPLE-MOVER
HAND-RAIL Leaning against the glass he starts to write a
message in GIGANTIC LETTERS

He walks along the moving rail trying to keep his spot
avoiding stepping on passing patrons while he writes

“T LOVE U”

It’s a beautiful expression of love The way every movie
should end

FROM INSIDE THE TANK -- Joe and Cam look up at the crazy
lunatic

Reading it in reverse Charlie has written “UEVOLI” Joe
cocks his head confused

JOE
Is that plural for uvula

Charlie steps down from the rail expecting the romantic
climax of two lovers jumping into one another’s arms

Instead he gets TACKLED BY TWO PARK SECURITY GUARDS and
wrestled to the ground

Cam and Joe run out to them to stop things before they
escalate

CAM
Stop it Stop it

The Guards release Charlie who dusts himself off

CAM (contd) (CONT’D)
Charlie what the hell are you
doing

He’s speechless

SECURITY GUARD
Is this guy your friend

Cam gives an embarrassed (hardly perceptible) nod

CAM
(sotto)
Charlie why have you been acting
sO crazy

Charlie is about to defend himself but looks around to see
the crowd gathered and realizes his behavior has no defense

CHARLIE
All right yes I’ve been acting a
little crazy But I have a
reasonable explanation

CAM
Let me guess You’re a lucky charm
and youre afraid I might marry the
next person I date So you’re
acting like a nut-job trying to
keep me

Charlie balks too embarrassed to say “exactly” AN OLDER
WOMAN uses a moment of silence to approach

OLDER WOMAN
Hi I’m sorry I was eavesdropping
Are you really Charlie Kagan the
lucky charm Because I was
wondering

CHARLIE
I’m sorry I can’t
(sees Cam walking away)
Wait Cam please

Charlie catches up to Cam (with Guards in tow)
CAM

Listen I think we should take a
break

CHARLIE
“AR break” That’s code for you
don’t want to date me anymore

Cam doesn’t say anything An awkward moment
Then out of the blue

JOE
(looking at the glass)
Hey look the plural for uvula
spells “I love you” backwards

Charlie pulls away from the security guards and moves to Cam
earnest and pleading Here it is the speech of the movie

CHARLIE

Listen to me I love you I’ve
loved you since the first moment I
saw you

(then)
My entire life I’ve been nothing
more than a stepping stone for
every relationship I’ve ever been
in There’s always a “next guy”
whos better than me For once I
want to be that next guy For
once I want to get the girl And
I want that girl to be you

A long beat Then
CAM
I’m sorry Charlie You’re just
not who I thought you were
Cam turns and walks back into the Penguin Tank She puts on

her mask and jumps into the water disappearing from
Charlie’s life forever

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 90

It’s raining Pouring We see Reba exiting the building
brandishing an umbrella for protection

She passes a couple of bums on the street (one huddled on a
bus stop bench) She stops and turns back realizing

REBA
Dr Kagan

Charlie looks up from the bench He’s soaked and looking
miserable

CHARLIE
Hi Reba

REBA
I was calling you all day Where
have you been

CHARLIE
(flat)
I decided to take the day off
(then)
Hey Do you know if our office
building has roof access

REBA
Things can’t be that bad
(then)
You know I owe you a “thank you”
I met a guy He’s wonderful I

really think he’s the one

CHARLIE
(sincere)
That’s great Reba Really I’m
happy for you

REBA
Youve done a good thing You’ve
helped people find love

This doesn’t seem to lift Charlie’s spirits Reba puts her
umbrella over him and they sit in silence for a moment

In front of them a HOMELESS MAN wrapped in garbage bags
picks through a trash can looking for recyclables

REBA (contd)

Do you know how many women there
are out there Waiting For you
(pointing to the downpour)

One for every raindrop

The HOMELESS MAN drops a bottle Charlie looks down as the
BOTTLE SPINS ON THE WET ASPHALT The spinning takes on an
almost magical quality

It stops pointing across the street Charlie glances up to

see a GOTH-LOOKING GIRL standing at the bus stop (although a

different girl she looks strikingly similar to our Goth Girl
from the opening make-out party) The girl gazes directly at
Charlie Eerie

We realize that Reba has been talking the entire time About
what we don’t know

REBA (cont’d)
Dr Kagan Are you all right

CHARLIE
(in a daze)
-fall like rain I’m in pain
Reba it’s just like she said
it’s raining All around

Reba looks him like he’s lost his marbles

REBA
That’s why I’m holding an
umbrella over you

CHARLIE
(starting to focus)

No Not rain Love Raining
love But I’m in pain See
(searching for words)
“Once they’ve been with you
they’1l find true” Omigod

Seeing things clearly for the first time Charlie dashes off
in the rain Reba sits alone on the bench confused

INT CAM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 91

Cam brushes the feathers of a sickly looking penguin

CAM
(gently to the bird)
I’m so sorry little buddy

Joe enters and sits down next to them

JOE
What’s up with Jester

CAM
His girlfriend died
(gently brushing him)
He stopped grooming himself
(MORE)

CAM (contd)
(disheartened)
This is the hardest part of this
job Almost worst than losing one
He’1l probably never try to find
someone to replace her

Joe slides over and helps to pamper the poor little guy

CAM (cont‘d)
It’s heart-breaking isn’t it To
think that you can fit together
with someone so completely that
when they’re gone there’s no one
to fill the empty space

After a beat

JOE
You should call him

CAM
He’s changed He’s crazy

JOE
To quote Beyoncé “Your loves got
me lookin’ so crazy right now Got
me lookin’ so crazy right now
Your touchs got me lookin’ so
crazy right now” Have I made my
point

From the look on her face he has

INT STU’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER 92

93 INT CHARLIE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Charlie drives Stu navigates

STU
A hex She put a hex on you I
have no recollection of this event
whatsoever How old were we

CHARLIE
I don’t know Ten Eleven It
doesn’t matter What matters is
that I’m hexed

STU
(convinced Chuck is nuts)
Okay I think I should be driving

CHARLIE

(ignoring him excited)
Don’t you remember Black
lipstick Long fingernails Total
freak She wanted to see my penis
and I wouldn’t show it to her so
she pulled my nipples and put a hex
on me

STU
Dude did you forget to pay your
brain bill

CHARLIE
Only she can break the spell

Stu glances at the Mapquest print-out
sTU

This is the address Stop the car
Stop the car

Charlie pulls the car over He stares at the house

CHARLIE
How do you think I get her to break
the spell

STU
I don’t know She wanted to see
your penis
Charlie gets out of the car and starts toward the house
STU (cont‘d)

(suddenly worried)
Um that was a joke

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS 94

Charlie walks to the front door and KNOCKS
A LITTLE 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL ANSWERS

CHARLIE
Hi is your mother home

The little girl just stares at him

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Is your mother’s name Anisha

LITTLE GIRL
What’s with the fifty questions

A beat

CHARLIE
That was only two questions

LITTLE GIRL
It’s a hyperbole

From behind the little girl a woman comes to the door She
is dressed in a flower-print dress looking more like Laura
Ashley than Marilyn Manson Charlie is taken aback

CHARLIE
Oh hi I think I have the
wrong
(then turning)
Sorry to bother you

She shrugs and starts to close the door At the last moment
Charlie stops the door from closing

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Are you Anisha Carter

ANISHA
(the answer clearly “yes”)
Do I know you

CHARLIE
I’m Charlie Kagan

He looks at her for some sign of recognition None comes

CHARLIE (cont’d)
I know this is going to sound
crazy but when we were kids you
put a hex on me so that all my
girlfriends would fall in love with
somebody else And I need you to
reverse the spell Am I making any
sense

Without saying anything Anisha cautiously reaches up to a
shelf by her door and pulls down a can of mace

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Apparently not

Charlie looks down at the little girl She wears the
identical Wicca pentagram necklace originally worn by Anisha
as a little girl

CHARLIE (contd)
That was yours wasn’t it
(to the girl)
Is your mommy’s name Anisha

LITTLE GIRL
(emotionless)
You gonna mace him Mom

Charlie gives the girl a look Anisha head-motions to her
daughter who reluctantly heads back inside sShucks

CHARLIE
Okay see the problem is that
were at an impasse here I know
you know what I’m talking about but
you aren’t talking And I need to
know how to break the hex This is
my life we’‘re talking about

Anisha is still silent

CHARLIE (contd)
What can I do to convince you

AT THE CAR -- Stu watches the scene with bemused fascination
STUS POV -- SUDDENLY without warning Charlie DROPS HIS
PANTS

INT COUNTY JAIL CELL - LATER 95

Charlie is once again behind bars He sits next to RUPERT a
400 POUND SHAVED-BALD INMATE (with soft eyes) who hangs on
his every word

CHARLIE
(loudly)
This sucks That’s right I said
it Do you know why I’m in here
Do you know why

Rupert shrugs answering in an unusually feminine voice

RUPERT
(wild stab)
Aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon

CHARLIE
(shaking his head)
Love Love Rupert I’m here
because of love Everybody else is
finding love but what about me

RUPERT
You deserve love
CHARLIE
Yes I do And do I deserve to be

in here

(Rupert shakes his head)
Exactly Indecent exposure my
ass You tell me what could
possibly be indecent about trying
to hold onto the only love of your
life

RUPERT
Nothing That’s not indecent

CHARLIE

(on a roll)
Lucky Charm They call me a “lucky
charm” But I’m not lucky I’m so
incredibly UN-lucky Sure it’s
lucky for everybody else that if
you have sex with me you find true
love but I’m miserable

RUPERT
We all need love

CHARLIE
(getting emotional)
Am I holding on too tight Is that
the problem To happiness To
passion To love

RUPERT
My mother told me once if you love
something set it free

Charlie nods his head letting the words sink in

CHARLIE
Thank you Rupert Those are
lovely words Really lovely
words

A beat Then RUPERT leans in and provocatively says

RUPERT
Now how does this lucky charm
work exactly What do we have to
do

Charlie’s jaw drops He glances around the cell -- all eyes
on him Oh shit

PRISON OFFICER
Charles Kagan You made bail

EXT COUNTY JAIL - MOMENTS LATER 96

Charlie stands on the steps of the jailhouse In front of
him is the BUTCH FEMALE POLICE OFFICER from earlier

CHARLIE
Seriously thank you Five more
seconds andI don’t know how to
thank you

BUTCH POLICE OFFICER
You already did You helped me
find the love of my life

The Butch Officer grabs the hand of her FEMALE “PARTNER”
standing next to her Charlie smiles and joins Stu at the
bottom of the steps They walk toward Charlie’s car

STU

So what’s the plan now Let me
guess we time travel to 2097 and
track down Cam’s reincarnated soul
drag her back into our world and
hope she falls in love with you
Or is it something involving the
gravitational pull of the Earth

CHARLIE
Stu I saw things clearly for the
first time in that cell I
realized that my whole life has
been spent protecting myself
against love Closing off my
heart When I should have been
opening it

STU
What about Cam You opened it for
Cam

CHARLIE

(shaking his head)
No see I didn’t What was the
first thing I did when I realized
that I might lose her I went
Chicken Little I was so scared
about the future that I totally
ignored the present I was so
concerned about the next guy that I
completely ignored this guy I was
so worried about losing my soulmate
that I lost view of the fact that
if I lose Cam she isn’t my soul-
mate to begin with

(then)
If you love something set it free

STU
Are you done
(Charlie nods)
I’m going home
(MORE)

STU (contd)
Bailing you out of jail every
fifteen minutes has seriously eaten
into my masturbation time
But Stu’s disposition can’t dampen Charlie’s new resolve

DISSOLVE TO

INT CHARLIE’S HOUSE - LATER 97

SWELLLING MUSIC UP as Charlie picks up his phone and dials

We REVEAL that he holds a book on Penguins written by
HOWARD BLAINE

CHARLIE (INTO PHONE)
Hi I’m trying to find a Howard
Blaine
(beat)
Hi Howard We’ve um never met
But I have a friend that you need
to meet

EXT STARBUCKS - LATER 98
BITTERSWEET MUSIC CONTINUES as we watch Cam hustle down the
street toward a COFFEE SHOP She checks her watch and looks
around the place

She approaches someone sitting with his back toward her
When the man turns we REVEAL that it’s Howard who greets
her with a hug She sits with a warm smile

EXT PARK - CONTINUOUS 99

CLOSE ON CAM -- sitting on the lush grass She’s laughing
Having a nice time talking to Howard

They laugh some more

INT RESTAURANT - LATER 100

The MUSIC CONTINUES as Howard and Cam have dinner at a fancy
restaurant on the water More conversation More bonding

Howard knocks over his glass of water Cam bursts out
laughing These two are perfect for each other

INT PENGUIN HABITAT - LATER 101

Cam and Howard are in the Habitat tank Howard plays with
the penguins as Cam proudly shows off her flat-footed
friends video-taping their antics with her camera

AT THE FAR END OF THE HABITAT we see Charlie in the
distance coming around the bend on the PEOPLE MOVER

He sees Cam talking to Howard in the tank He nods his head
trying to be happy for her But that emotion is quickly
followed by dysphoria as he starts to walk backwards on the
mover -- hoping they won’t see him He walks against the
grain and toward the entrance again bumping into a RED-
HEADED WOMAN as he goes

The MUSIC FADES as he slowly turns and walks out of the
park

INT CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 102

The room is DARK AND GLOOMY Shutters closed It feels like
a morgue Charlie sits on the couch In a robe Eyes open
He could be dead

SUDDENLY light streams in the door as Stu bursts in He
starts talking immediately

STU
I’m getting married

Charlie doesn’t move

STU (cont’d)
I found my dream-girl dude and I
just proposed and it’s all because
of you
(calling outside)
Lara Come on in

A moment later the TREMENDOUSLY STACKED AND PACKED TANK-TOP
GIRL (the one who earlier wouldn’t take her top off for
Charlie) steps in the room

Charlie is obviously surprised to see her (and the huge rock
on her finger)

STU (cont’d)
Lara stepped out of heaven and into
my office to correct a “condition”
She’s got Polymastia

(MORE)

STU (contd)
(off Charlie’s blank look)
More than two boobs You wanna
see

CHARLIE
No no-no-no--

LARA
It’s okay I mean if you want
(a weight lifted)
I used to be embarrassed until Stu
made me realize how special I was

Without waiting for Charlie’s consent Lara lifts her shirt
Although we don’t see the boobs (unfortunately we see the
scene from behind her) we DO see Charlie’s reaction

STU
Is that or is that not the most
beautiful sight you’ve ever seen
It’s like seeing the Grand Canyon
for the first time like seeing
Earth from space like seeing the
Olsen Twins make out with each
other

Lara puts down her shirt and Stu baby-kisses her a couple of
times getting lovey-dovey Charlie smiles meekly

CHARLIE
I’m happy for you buddy

STU

But that’s not the reason we came

(then changing subjects)
You know it smells like cheese in
here Gouda maybe You might
want to open a window

(to Lara back on point)
Okay tell him baby

LARA
I’m friends with Katie and she told
me that Cam Wexler--

STU
--Cam Cameron your Cam--

CHARLIE
(nodding curt)
I know who she is

LARA
Anyway Katie said that Cam said
that she’s leaving for Antarctica
with some penguin guru

A beat as Charlie takes this in Calmly

CHARLIE
That’s good I’m happy for her

Stu stares at Charlie waiting for him to come to his senses
Over the course of 30 seconds we watch as Charlie goes
through all 7 stages of grief Then common sense finally
kicks in

CHARLIE (cont’d)
What the fuck am I doing

sTU
That’s what I’m saying to you

CHARLIE SPEEDILY STARTS GETTING DRESSED

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER 103

Charlie drives up to a stoplight cell phone to his ear On
the seat next to him is ENGAGEMENT RING BOX from earlier

CHARLIE (INTO PHONE)
Joe you’re not listening to me I
need to know where Cam is
(beat)
Your sister

The signal is taking too long -- Charlie hops out of the car
runs over to PRESS THE PEDESTRIAN SIGNAL to hurry the light
change up Still on the phone

CHARLIE (contd)

Joe I need you to focus for a
moment This is important

(then quickly)
What time What airline What
flight

(beat then annoyed)
Cam Your sister

The light still hasn’t changed There hasn’t been one car in
the road since he stopped Charlie YELLS in frustration He
hangs up the phone and looks both ways

Not a car in sight The light still red

Charlie GUNS IT across the street

Three seconds later a whirring light and siren behind him
He looks into the rearview -- a COP Shit He pulls over

OUT OF THE POLICE CAR steps the SAME POLICE OFFICER WHO
RECENTLY SENT HIM TO JAIL
EXT FREEWAY - A LITTLE WHILE LATER 104
Charlie is on the phone again speeding along the freeway
On the seat next to him is the engagement ring box AND A
NEWLY WRITTEN TRAFFIC TICKET
CHARLIE (INTO PHONE)

Behind him a siren and lights He pulls over

Charlie sinks in his seat

Charlie is speeding along the freeway AGAIN On the seat

SPEEDING TICKET to go along with the traffic ticket

SUDDENLY a siren and lights He pulls over AGAIN

OUT OF THE POLICE CAR steps the SAME OFFICER WHO WROTE HIM A
SPEEDING TICKET 8 lines ago

EXT FREEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 106
Charlie is driving SLOWLY and CAUTIOUSLY down the freeway
The POLICE CAR follows behind him waiting for any law-
breaking

Charlie sees an EXIT for the BEACH Using BOTH HIS BLINKER-

SIGNAL AND A HAND-SIGNAL TO TURN OFF the freeway he takes
the exit Where is he going What the hell

EXT BEACH ACCESS - CONTINUOUS 107

Charlie walks out to a rocky inlet of the ocean The water
breaks upon the rocks dramatically Charlie walks out into
the sand Double what the hell

EXT AIRPORT - A SHORT TIME LATER 108

Charlie PULLS UP to the terminal and darts toward the door
A TRAFFIC COP YELLS FOR HIM TO STOP but Charlie runs inside
the building

INT AIRPORT TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS 109
Charlie approaches the ticket counter

CHARLIE

AIR ATTENDANT

CHARLIE
Has the one with a passenger named
Cam Wexler boarded yet

AIR ATTENDANT

Charlie starts to move toward the gate

AIR ATTENDANT (cont’d)
Sir you won’t be able to go the
gate without a ticket

Charlie takes out his wallet

CHARLIE
Id like a ticket to Antarctica
Actually I’d like two tickets to
Antarctica One on each plane

AIR ATTENDANT

available sir

CHARLIE
(defeated)
Of course there are

The Air Attendant starts typing on the computer Charlie
looks on anxiously

He glances outside to see his CAR BEING TOWED AWAY
AIR ATTENDANT
Are you travelling with any
baggage

CHARLIE
No

AIR ATTENDANT
You do realize that it’s negative
sixty degrees

CHARLIE

She nods and prints out the tickets
AIR ATTENDANT

four hundred and twelve dollars
INT AIRPORT - SECURITY - MOMENTS LATER 110
Charlie passes through security They make him take off his
shoes His belt They scan him down with the hand-held wand
just to make it go a little slower

INT AIRPORT - GATE - MOMENTS LATER 111

Charlie makes his way onto the first plane just boarding

INT PLANE - CONTINUOUS 112

He walks through the plane side-stepping boarding passengers
wearing parkas and carrying heavy winter coats

CHARLIE

INT AIRPORT - GATE - CONTINUOUS 113

From the other side of the terminal Charlie sees Cam
boarding the other flight

He RUSHES OVER giving his second ticket to the STEWARDESS

INT THIRD PLANE - CONTINUOUS 114

Cam finds her seat She is about to put her carry-on into
the overhead compartment

CHARLIE’S VOICE
Here let me help you with that

CAM
Thank you

She turns surprised to see Charlie standing next to her

CAM (cont’d)
Charlie

CHARLIE

I’m sorry Don’t be mad

(to Howard sitting in the

center seat)
Antarctica You couldn’t just take
in a movie

(then)
Cam I know it seems a little crazy
that I’ve showed up here but I have
to tell you in all honesty that it
felt even crazier NOT to show up

(on a roll)
It’s just that when you find the
right person it feels wrong to
fight it

(shaking his head)
Oh God this was a bad idea
wasn’t it I mean you’re going
away with Howard

Charlie’s face drops giving in to the inevitable
CAM
Charlie have you met Howards
wife Marilyn

The red-headed MARILYN sits at the window She looks up and
smiles politely Charlie stands there shocked

WE SEE A FLASHBACK WIPE -- (a la “Sixth Sense” we get to see
the scenes as they REALLY were)

CAM AT THE PARK WITH HOWARD The camera PULLS back a littls
further than before to REVEAL that sitting next to them was
Marilyn enjoying the conversation

CAM AT THE RESTAURANT WITH HOWARD The camera DOLLIES OVHR 6a
little to REVEAL Marilyn was also there Howard spills his
drink again and they all laugh

CAM AND HOWARD IN THE PENGUIN TANK We see Charlie backing7
off the People Mover He BUMPS INTO the red-headed Marilyn
as he makes his way out of the park

BACK TO THE PRESENT -—- 118
Charlie realizes he’s made an awful awful mistake

CHARLIE
Oh wow I um I had to see you
I couldn’t let you go to Antarctica
without seeing you again

CAM
But I‘1l be back on Wednesday

A long beat A very long beat

CHARLIE
So maybe I’1l call you on
Thursday
(then)
Or Friday Better yet why don’t
you call me

Cam moves closer to him

CAM
Howard told me about your call

Charlie braces himself for the slap

CAM (contd)
That was the nicest thing anyone
has ever said about me

CHARLIE
So I embellished a little bit
(off her smile)
A lot I embellished a lot What
can I say you’re a tough sell

CAM
If you wanted me so badly why did
you work so hard to get Howard to
meet me

CHARLIE
Mate selection is up to the female
I thought I’d give the other birds
a chance
(then with a shrug)
I knew you wanted to meet him I
knew it would make you happy

She smiles and kisses him lightly on the cheek

CHARLIE (contd)
So you forgive me for acting
erazy

CAM
Not even a little bit
(then)
But I’m willing to wipe the slate
clean Start from square one
Before square one

CHARLIE
I’1ll pretend that I don’t know you
again

CAM

And Ill pretend that I don’t like
you again

Charlie looks over to Howard who is holding hands with his
wife

CHARLIE
He’s married
(she nods excited)
That makes it even better that I
called him

She smiles at his off-center sense of humor

CAM
Listen when I get back no more
flowers or balloons or telegrams
or monkey-grams

CHARLIE
I promise

CAM
And when I trip over myself I
expect you to still laugh at me

CHARLIE
Okay
(then)
I won’t just laugh I’11 point

CAM
(nodding)
So I’‘ll see you when I get back

A FEMALE PASSENGER sitting two rows back pipes up

FEMALE PASSENGER
Excuse me aren’t you Charlie Ka--

CAM
Can it He’s mine

And with that she gives him a kiss that literally changes
the cabin’s air pressure They pull apart Charlie is about
to leave but

CHARLIE
Oh I almost forgot

He hands her the ENGAGEMENT BOX She looks down at it
worried -- hes acting crazy again already

Without another word Charlie EXITS the plane
Slowly suspiciously Cam opens the box
INSIDE -- is a PEBBLE A tiny perfect stone

She smiles

INT CHILD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 119

(Ex-Goth Girl) Anisha Carter kisses her daughter good night
She walks toward her room as we hear the following in VO

CAM (VO)
I promise to sleep by your side to
warm your body and heart and to
nurture your soul I promise to
laugh with you when times are good
and suffer with you when they are
bad
(MORE)

CAM (VO) (contd)
and most of all I promise never to
make you live off your own fat

We follow Anisha into her bedroom She OPENS a SECRET ROOM
in the back of her closet to REVEAL (to our surprise) a vast
assortment of WITCHCRAFT PARAPHERNALIA We continue to hear
the vows

CHARLIE (0S)

I promise to be your Gentoo I
will wash your tears away with my
kisses and never let you stray too
far away from my soul I promise
to be your safe haven in this life
to never take you for granted but
to always give you your space
especially if you’re tripping or
walking into doors I love you

As the vows come to a close Anisha gently pulls an old
elementary school photograph of Charlie out of an alter-like
shrine (complete with a home-made heart with a pin through
it a cup with musty rain water and many “lucky” items such
as a horseshoe a rabbit’s foot a four-leaf clover etc)

With a satisfied smile she starts to disassemble the shrine

EXT SEA WORLD - NIGHT 120

We hear PARTY MUSIC as the CAMERA TRACKS into the DOLPHIN
TANK EXHIBIT As we round the corner we see hundreds of
penguins waddling around in little iced cubicles each
wearing their natural black-and-white tuxedos

TILT UP to see hundreds of WEDDING GUESTS

The Dolphin Tank has been covered over with a glass dance-
floor so that the exquisite animals swim underneath the
partying people It’s unbelievably beautiful

The gang is all here -- and just about everybody is with
someone they love Reba with her new guy Carol with hers
Stacey Katie Nicole Pleasure Howard with Marilyn Joe
(wearing a HEMP TUX) and even Eleanor Skepple (all with
their mates)

We finally come upon Stu his arm around Lara who sports a
modified bridesmaid dress (altered to make room for her third
boob) Stu looks with adoration at his new bride uttering
what is perhaps his only truly sincere line in the film

STU
Do you have any idea how much I
love you

LARA
(answering with a callback
of Stu’s earlier line)
Do bridesmaids give head in the
coat room

STU
I don’t know Do they

LARA
Why don’t we go find out

They make a quick exit toward the foyer passing Cam and
Charlie who are taking the floor for their “first dance”
Charlie spins Cam who trips on her train stumbling back
She grabs a hold of Charlie to keep herself from falling but
only manages to take him with her as they both FALL BACKWARDS
INTO THE MASSIVE FOUR-TIERED BEAUTIFULLY ORNATE WEDDING CARE

The couple clean themselves off as all the SINGLE WOMEN
gather at the edge of the dance floor for the throwing of the
bouquet

Cam HEAVES the flowers over her shoulder A more than able-
bodied throw We watch as the women surge back to grab the
flying floral arrangement

Back back and
INTO THE WATER BEHIND THEM As half the wedding party trips

and SPLASHES into the WHALE TANK Cam looks back to Charlie
embarrassed (OOPS) as we

FADE OUT
AS THE CREDITS ROLL WE
FADE BACK IN
SUPER “One Year Later”
EXT ANTARCTICA - SUNSET 121

A stunningly beautiful shot of Cam and Charlie enjoying the
once-in-a-year sunset together in the snows of Antarctica

INT CHARLIE AND CAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 122

Stu rifling through Charlie’s dresser drawer Lara is
sitting topless on the bed showing off the most perfect set
of three breasts imaginable They are mesmerizing -- as she
moves they bounce and sway (NOTE these aren’t “TOTAL
RECALL” cheesy-looking triple-nipples we’re talking ILM’s
finest)

LARA
What are you looking for

STU
Sex tapes Why bother house-
sitting if you can’t scope out some
good old-fashioned home-made porn

Suddenly -- Ah-haiii Stu pulls out an unmarked DV tape
safely tucked into an old tube sock

He puts the tape into the machine -- all smiles and presses
PLAY

ON THE SCREEN -- we see Cam and Charlie’s home-made sex tape

(SCREENWRITER’S NOTE I don’t know if you’ve ever videotaped
yourself having sex but let me tell you from experience it
isn’t pretty Most home-made tapes fall into the genre of
“Porn-Horror”)

As the credits continue to roll we see out-of-focus shots
and incredibly embarrassing moments from Cam and Charlies
“magical” night The beautifully shot “movie” version was
nothing close to what really happened Some of the moments
include

-- Having forgotten it was laundry day Cam realizes (too
late) that she is wearing her Granny panties”

-- At Cam’s urging Charlie tries to “talk nasty” but has a
hard time getting the hang of it (ie “Ooo yeah bounce your
boobs like a bouncy hippity hop Wait can I start
over again” )

-- “Whoah whoah whoah wrong hole”

-- Charlie trying to blame the “squeaky bed” for what was
unquestionably flatulence

-- While reaching for lubrication (which spills EVERYWHERE
and makes it difficult to hold the camera) Charlie discovers
Cams stash of a zillion sex toys

-- We see some CLOSE UP FOOTAGE of Cam and Charlie having sex
(we hear them groaning in the background) that could easily
be footage of INTESTINAL SURGERY on the Discovery Channel
When we CUTAWAY to see Lara and Stu watching they look to be
on the verge of getting sick

-- Back on the tape we see Charlie crying after the first
round of sex taken with emotion Sad and pathetic

-- Round two Charlie tries “talking nasty” again With
even less luck “Oh yeah do me like like a thing
that you do that you really like when you do it Uh-
huh Do me sort of like that Okay I give up”

-- For the final shot the camera is CLOSE on Charlie It’s
clear that Cam is on top of him and they are grinding
passionately We hear her orgasming and as she does she
DROPS THE CAMERA -- it SMACKS CHARLIE IN THE FACE Ouch
The image FUTZES OUT as we go

BLACK
