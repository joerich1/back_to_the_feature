FADE IN

ON COMPUTER SCREEN
so close it has no boundaries

A blinding cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light burning beneath
the derma of black-neon glass

A PHONE begins to RING we hear it as though we were
making the call The cursor continues to throb
relentlessly patient until --

MAN (VO)
Yeah

Data now slashes across the screen information flashing
faster then we can read Call trans opt received
2-19-98 132418 RECLog

WOMAN (VO)
Is everything in place

On screen Trace program running

We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
a third line The mans name is Cypher The woman
Trinity

TRINITY (WOMANVO )
I said is everything in place

The entire screen with racing columns of numbers
Shimmering like green-electric rivers they rush at a
10-digit phone number in the top corner

CYPHER (MANVO)
You werent supposed to relieve
me

TRINITY (VO)
I know but I felt like taking a
shift

The area code is identified The first three numbers
suddenly fixed leaving only seven flowing columns

CYPHER (VO)
You like him dont you You like
watching him

We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen CLOSING IN as each
digit is matched one by one snapping into place like
the wheels of a slot machine

( )

TRINITY (VO)
Dont be ridiculous

CYPHER (VO)
Were going to kill him Do you
understand that Hes going to
die just like the others

TRINITY (VO)
Morpheus believes he is the One

Only two thin digits left

CYPHER (VO)

Do you

TRINITY (VO)
I it doesnt matter what I
believe

CYPHER (VO)
You dont do you

TRINITY (VO)
If you have something to say I
suggest you say it to Morpheus

CYPHER (VO)

CYPHER (VO)

TRINITY (VO)

CYPHER (VO)

We MOVE STILL CLOSER the ELECTRIC HUM of the green
NUMBERS GROWING into an ominous ROAR

TRINITY (VO)
I better go

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 3 1

She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers entering the
nether world of the computer screen Suddenly a flash-
light cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in --

INT HEART O THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT 2

The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way
across the polyester carpeting destroying several rooms
as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving
patterns of permanent shadow

We FOLLOW four armed POLICE OFFICERS using flashlights as
they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
on either side of Room 303

The biggest of them violently kicks in the door The other
cops pour in behind him guns thrust before them

BIG COP
Police Freeze

The room is almost devoid of furniture There is a fold-
up table and chair with a phone a modem and a powerbook
computer The only light in the room is the glow of the
computer

Sitting there her hands still on the keyboard is
TRINITY a woman in black leather

BIG COP
Hands behind your head Now Do
it

She slowly puts her hands behind her head

EXT HEART O THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT 3

A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the
police cruisers AGENT SMITH AGENT BROWN and AGENT
JONES get out of the car

They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night They
are also always hardwired small Secret Service earphones
in one ear the cord coiling back into their shirt
collars

AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant

LIEUTENANT
Oh shit

( )
THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 4

AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant you were given
specific orders --

LIEUTENANT
Im just doing my job You gimme
that Juris-my dick-tion and you
can cram it up your ass

AGENT SMITH
The orders were for your
protection

The Lieutenant laughs

LIEUTENANT
I think we can handle one little
girl

Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
hotel

LIEUTENANT
I sent two units Theyre
bringing her down now

AGENT SMITH
No Lieutenant your men are
already dead

INT HEART O THE CITY HOTEL

The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs the other cops holding
a bead Theyve done this a hundred times they know
theyve got her until the Big Cop reaches with the cuffs
and Trinity moves --

It almost doesnt register so smooth and fast inhumanly
fast

The eye blinks and Trinitys palm snaps up and the nose
explodes blood erupting Her leg kicks with the force
of a wrecking ball and he flies back a two-hundred-fifty
pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into the cop
farthest from her

Trinity moves again BULLETS RAKING the walls
flashlights sweeping with panic as the remaining cops try
to stop a leather-clad ghost

A GUN still in the cops hand is snatched twisted and
FIRED There is a final violent exchange of GUNFIRE and
when its over Trinity is the only one standing

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 5

A flashlight rocks slowly to a stop

TRINITY
Shit

EXT HEART O THE CITY HOTEL

Agent Brown enters the hotel while Agent Smith heads for
the alley

INT HEART O THE CITY HOTEL

Trinity is on the phone pacing The other end is
answered

MAN (VO)
Operator

TRINITY
Morpheus The line was traced I
dont know how

MORPHEUS (MANVO)
I know They cut the hardline
This line is not a viable exit

TRINITY
Are there any Agents

MORPHEUS (VO)
Yes

TRINITY
Goddamnit

MORPHEUS (VO)
You have to focus There is a
phone Wells and Lake You can
make it
She takes a deep breath centering herself

TRINITY
All right --

MORPHEUS (VO)
Go

She drops the phone

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 6
INT HALL 7

She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the
hall leading another unit of police Trinity races to
the opposite end exiting through a broken window onto
the fire escape

EXT FIRE ESCAPE 8

In the alley below Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at
her She can only go up

EXT ROOF 9

On the roof Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over
the parapet leading the cops in pursuit

Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next her
movements so clean gliding in and out of each jump
contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops

Agent Brown however has the same unnatural grace

The roof falls away into a wide back alley The next
building is over 40 feet away but Trinitys face is
perfectly calm staring at some point beyond the other roof

COP
Thats it we got her now

The cops slow realizing they are about to see something
ugly as Trinity drives at the edge launching herself
into the air

From above the ground seems to flow beneath her as she
hangs in flight then hits somersaulting up still
running hard

COP
Jesus Christ -- thats impossible

They stare slack-jawed as Agent Brown duplicates the move
exactly landing rolling over a shoulder up onto one knee

It is a dizzying chase up and over the dark plateaued
landscape of rooftops and sheer cliffs of brick Ahead

she sees her only chance 50 feet beyond the point where

her path drops away into a paved chasm there is--

EXT WINDOW 10
A yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick building

Trinity zeros in on it running as hard as she can and --
( )

Al10

10

Hurtles herself into the empty night space her body
leveling into a dive She falls arms covering her head
as the whole world seems to spin on its axis --

INT BACK STAIRWELL A10

And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD then
falls onto a back stairwell tumbling bouncing down
stairs bleeding broken --

But still alive

She wheels on the smashed opening above her gun
instantly in her hand trained waiting for Agent Brown
but is met by only a slight WIND that HISSES against the
fanged maw of broken glass

Trinity tries to move Everything hurts
TRINITY
Get up Trinity Youre fine

Get up -- just get up

She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs

EXT STREET 11

Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and at the
end of the block in a pool of white street light she
sees it--

The telephone booth

Obviously hurt she starts down the concrete walk
focusing in completely her pace quickening as the PHONE
begins to RING

Across the street a garbage truck suddenly u-turns its
TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates Trinity sees the
headlights of the truck arcing at the telephone booth as
if taking aim

Gritting through the pain she races the truck slamming
into the booth the headlights blindingly bright bearing
down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

She answers the phone

There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking
mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 8

Barreling through the booth bulldozing it into a brick
wall SMASHING it to PLEXIGLAS PULP

After a moment a black loafer steps down from the cab of
the garbage truck Agent Smith inspects the wreckage
There is no body Trinity is gone

His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration
Agent Jones and Brown walk up behind him

AGENT JONES
She got out

AGENT SMITH
It doesnt matter

AGENT BROWN
The informant is real

Agent Smith almost smiles

AGENT SMITH
Yes

AGENT JONES
We have the name of their next target

AGENT BROWN
The name is Neo

The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground separated
in the crash like a severed limb

AGENT SMITH
Well need a search running

AGENT JONES
Its already begun

We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone CLOSER
and CLOSER until the smooth gray plastic spreads out
like a horizon and the small holes widen until we FALL
THROUGH one --

Swallowed by DARKNESS
The DARKNESS CRACKLES with phosphorescent energy the
word searching blazing in around us as we EMERGE FROM a

computer screen

The screen flickers with windowing data as a search
engine runs with a steady relentless rhythm

We DRIFT BACK FROM the screen and INTO --

INT NEOS APARTMENT 12

It is a studio apartment that seems overgrown with
technology

Weed-like cables coil everywhere duct-taped into
thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
desks Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment
that lay open like an autopsied corpse

At the center of this technological rat-nest is NEO a
man who knows more about living inside a computer than
outside one

He is asleep in front of his PC Behind him the
computer screen suddenly goes blank A prompt appears
Wake up Neo

Neos eye pries open He sits up one eye still closed
looking around unsure of where he is He notices the
screen

He types CTRL X but the letter T appears

NEO
What

He hits another and an H appears He keeps typing
pushing random functions and keys while the computer
types out a message as though it had a mind of its own

He stops and stares at the four words on the screen
The Matrix has you

NEO
What the hell

He hits the ESC button Another message appears
Follow the white rabbit

He hits it again and the message repeats He rubs his
eyes but when he opens them there is another message
Knock knock Neo

Someone KNOCKS on his door and he almost jumps out of his
chair He looks back at the computer but the screen is
now blank

Someone KNOCKS again Neo rises still unnerved

NEO
Who is it

CHOI (0S)
Its Choi

( )

12

Neo flips a series of locks and opens the door leaving
the chain on A young Chinese MAN stands there with
several of his friends

NEO
Youre two hours late

CHOI (MAN)
I know Its her fault

NEO
You got the money

CHOI
Two grand

He takes out an envelope and gives it to Neo through the
cracked door

NEO
Hold on

He closes the door On the floor near his bed is a book
Baudrillards Simulacra and Simulations The book has
been hollowed out and inside are several computer disks
He takes one sticks the money in the book and drops it
on the floor

Opening the door he hands the disk to Choi

CHOI
Hallelujah You are my Savior
man My own personal Jesus
Christ

NEO
If you get caught using that --

CHOI
I know I know This never
happened You dont exist

NEO
Right

Neo nods as the strange feeling of unrealness suddenly
returns

CHOI
Something wrong man You look a
little whiter than usual

NEO
I dont know My computer

( )

He looks back at Choi unable to explain what just
happened

NEO
You ever have the feeling that
youre not sure if youre awake or
still dreaming

CHOI
All the time Its called
mescaline and it is the only way
to fly

He smiles and slaps the hand of his nearest droog

CHOI
It sounds to me like you need to
unplug man A little RandR What
do you think Dujour should we
take him with us

DUJOUR

Definitely
NEO

I cant I have to work tomorrow
DUJOUR

Come on Itll be fun I

promise
He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins bands
symbols slogans military medals and --
A small white rabbit The ROOM TILTS
NEO
Yeah yeah Sure Ill go

INT APARTMENT

An older apartment a series of halls connects a chain of
small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements

Smoke hangs like a veil blurring the few lights there
are

Dressed predominately in black people are everywhere
gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
jungle cats around a tree

( )

13

Neo stands against a wall alone sipping from a bottle
of beer feeling completely out of place He is about to
leave when he notices a woman staring at him

The woman is Trinity She walks straight up to him

In the nearest room shadow-like figures grind against
each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC

TRINITY
Hello Neo

NEO
How do you know that name

TRINITY
I know a lot about you Ive been
wanting to meet you for some time

NEO
Who are you

TRINITY
My name is Trinity

NEO
Trinity The Trinity The
Trinity that cracked the IRS

D-Base

TRINITY
That was a long time ago

NEO
Gee-zus

TRINITY
What

NEO

I just thought you were a guy

TRINITY
Most guys do

Neo is a little embarrassed

NEO
Do you want to go somewhere and
talk

TRINITY

No Its safe here and I dont
have much time

( ) 13

The MUSIC is so LOUD they must stand very close talking
directly into each others ear

NEO
That was you on my computer

She nods

NEO
How did you do that

TRINITY
Right now all I can tell you is
that you are in danger I brought
you here to warn you

NEO
Of what
TRINITY
Theyre watching you Neo
NEO
Who is
TRINITY

Please Just listen I know why
youre here Neo I know what
youve been doing I know why you
hardly sleep why you live alone
and why night after night you
sit at your computer Youre
looking for him

Her body is against his her lips very close to his ear

TRINITY
I know because I was once looking
for the same thing but when he
found me he told me I wasnt
really looking for him I was
looking for an answer

There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
the words like a drug seeping into him

TRINITY
Its the question that drives us
the question that brought you
here You know the question just
as I did

NEO
What is the Matrix

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 32298 14

TRINITY
When I asked him he said that no
one could ever be told the answer
to that question They have to
see it to believe it

She leans close her lips almost touching his ear

TRINITY
The answer is out there Neo
Its looking for you and it will
find you if you want it to

She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
of bodies

A SOUND RISES steadily growing out of the MUSIC
pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

CUT TO
INT NEOS APARTMENT

The sound is an ALARM CLOCK slowly dragging Neo to
consciousness He strains to read the clock-face
915AM

EXT SKYSCRAPER

The downtown office of Meta CorTechs a software
development company

INT META CORTECHS OFFICE

The main offices are along each wall the windows
overlooking downtown RHINEHEART the ultimate company
man lectures Neo without looking at him typing at his
computer continuously

Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
outside dragging their rubber squeegees down the surface
of the glass

RHINEHEART
You have a problem with authority
Mr Anderson You believe that
you are special that somehow the
rules do not apply to you
Obviously you are mistaken

( )

16
His long bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard

RHINEHEART
This company is one of the top
software companies in the world
because every single employee
understands that they are a part
of a whole Thus if an employee
has a problem the company has a
problem

He turns again

RHINEHEART
The time has come to make a
choice Mr Anderson Either you
choose to be at your desk on time
from this day forth or you choose
to find yourself another job Do
I make myself clear

NEO
Yes Mr Rhineheart Perfectly
clear
INT NEOS CUBICLE 17

The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb with a
labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
elevators

VOICE (0OS)
Thomas Anderson

Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS GUY at his cubicle
door

NEO
Yeah Thats me

Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex Guy hands him
the softpak

FEDEX GUY
Have a nice day

He opens the bag Inside is a cellular PHONE It seems
the instant it is in his hand it RINGS Unnerved he
flips it open

NEO
Hello

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 16

MORPHEUS (VO)
Hello Neo Do you know who this
is

Neos knees give and he sinks into his chair

NEO
Morpheus

MORPHEUS (VO)
Ive been looking for you Neo I
dont know if youre ready to see
what I want to show you but

time Theyre coming for you
Neo And Im not sure what

NEO
Whos coming for me

MORPHEUS (VO)
Stand up and see for yourself

NEO
Right now

MORPHEUS (VO)
Yes Now

Neo starts to stand

MORPHEUS (VO)
Do it slowly The elevator

His head peeks up over the partition At the elevator

he sees Agent Smith Agent Brown and Agent Jones leading a
group of cops A female employee turns and points out
Neos cubicle

Neo ducks

NEO
Holy shit

MORPHEUS (VO)
Yes

One cop stays at the elevator the others follow the
Agents

NEO
What the hell do they want with
me

( ) 17
MORPHEUS (VO)
Im not sure but if you dont
want to find out you better get
out of there

NEO
How

MORPHEUS (VO)
I can guide you out but you have
to do exactly what I say
The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle
MORPHEUS (VO)
The cubicle across from you is

empty

NEO
But what if

MORPHEUS (VO)
Go Now

Neo lunges across the hall diving into the other cubicle
just as the Agents turn into his row

Neo crams himself into a dark corner clutching the phone
tightly to him
MORPHEUS (VO)

Stay here for a moment

The Agents enter Neos empty cubicle A cop is sent to
search the bathroom

Morpheus voice is a whisper in Neos ear

MORPHEUS (VO)
A little longer

Brown is talking to another employee
MORPHEUS (VO)
When I tell you go to the end of
the row to the first office on the
left stay as low as you can

Sweat trickles down his forehead

MORPHEUS (VO)
Now

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998

Neo rolls out of the cubicle his eyes popping as he
freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around

Staying crouched he sneaks away down the row shooting

across the opening to the first office on the

INT EMPTY OFFICE
The room is empty

MORPHEUS (VO)
Good Outside there is a scaffold

NEO
How do you know all this

Morpheus laughs quietly

MORPHEUS (VO)
The answer is coming Neo There
is a window in front of you Open
it

He opens the window The WIND HOWLS into the
MORPHEUS (VO)

You can use the scaffold to get to
the roof

NEO
No Its too far away

MORPHEUS (VO)
Theres a ledge Its a short
short climb You can make it

left

room

Neo looks down the buildings glass wall vertigos into a

concrete chasm

NEO
No way no way this is crazy

MORPHEUS (VO)
There are only two ways out of
this building One is that
scaffold The other is in their
custody You take a chance either
way I leave it to you

CLICK He hangs up Neo looks at the door
the scaffold

then back at

18

NEO
This is insane Why is this
happening to me What did I do
Im nobody I didnt do anything

He climbs up onto the window ledge Hanging onto the
frame he steps onto the small ledge The scaffold seems
even farther away

NEO
Im going to die

The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building
knocking Neo off balance Recoiling he clings harder to
the frame and the phone falls out of his hand

He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath
him

NEO
This is insane I cant do this
Forget it

He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
door

NEO
Shit

EXT SKYSCRAPER 19

The Agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
doors forcing his head down as they push him into the
dark sedan

Trinity watches in the rearview mirror of her motorcycle

TRINITY
Shit

INT INTERROGATION ROOM 20

CLOSE ON a camera monitor a wide angle view of a white
room where Neo is sitting at a table alone We MOVE INTO
the monitor entering the room as if the monitor was a
window

At the same moment the door opens and the Agents enter
Agent Smith sits down across from Neo A thick manila
envelope slaps down on the table The name on the file
Anderson ThomasA

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998

He opens the file
flips several pages

AGENT SMITH
As you can see weve had our eye
on you for some time now Mr
Anderson

the file or at him

The pages

Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit

He closes

AGENT SMITH
It seems that you have been living
two lives In one life you are
Thomas A Anderson program writer
for a respectable software
company You have a social
security number you pay your
taxes and you help your landlady
carry out her garbage

continue to turn

AGENT SMITH
The other life is lived in
computers where you go by the
hacker alias Neo and are guilty
of virtually every computer crime
we have a law for

AGENT SMITH
One of these lives has a future
One of them does not

the file

AGENT SMITH
Im going to be as forthcoming as
I can be Mr Anderson You are
here because we need your help

Paper rattle marks the silence as he
Neo cannot tell if he is looking at

He removes his sunglasses his eyes are an unnatural ice-

blue

AGENT SMITH
We know that you have been
contacted by a certain individual
A man who calls himself Morpheus
Whatever you think you know about
this man is irrelevant The fact
is that he is wanted for acts of
terrorism in more countries than
any other man in the world

(MORE )

( )

20 20

AGENT SMITH (CONTD)
He is considered by many
authorities to be the most
dangerous man alive

He leans closer

AGENT SMITH
My colleagues believe that I am
wasting my time with you but I
believe you want to do the right
thing It is obvious that you are
an intelligent man Mr Anderson
and that you are interested in the
future That is why I believe you
are ready to put your past
mistakes behind you and get on
with your life

Neo tries to match his stare

AGENT SMITH
We are willing to wipe the slate
clean to give you a fresh start
and all we are asking in return is
your cooperation in bringing a
known terrorist to justice

Neo nods to himself

NEO
Yeah Wow That sounds like a
real good deal But I think I
have a better one How about I
just give you the finger --

He does

NEO
And you give me my phone call

Agent Smith puts his glasses back on

AGENT SMITH
You disappoint me Mr Anderson

NEO
You cant scare me with this
Gestapo crap I know my rights
I want my phone call
Agent Smith smiles

( ) 20

AGENT SMITH
And tell me Mr Anderson what
good is a phone call if you are
unable to speak

The question unnerves Neo and strangely he begins to feel
the muscles in his jaw tighten The standing Agents
snicker watching Neos confusion grow into panic

Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
seal shut melding into each other until all traces of
his mouth are gone

Wild with fear he lunges for the door but the Agents
restrain him holding him in the chair

AGENT SMITH
You are going to help us Mr
Anderson whether you want to or
not

Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt Froma
case taken out of his suit coat Smith removes a long
fiber-optic wire tap

Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
his exposed abdomen Horrified he watches as the
electronic device animates becoming an organic creature
that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm

Thin whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
Neos navel He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

-- before it begins to burrow its tail thrashing as it
worms its way inside

INT NEOS APARTMENT - NIGHT 21
Screaming Neo bolts upright in bed

He realizes that he is home Was it a dream His mouth

is normal His stomach looks fine He starts to take a
deep everything-is-okay breath when --

The PHONE RINGS

It almost stops his heart It continues RINGING

building pressure in the room forcing him up out of bed
sucking him in with an almost gravitational force He

answers it saying nothing

MORPHEUS (VO)
This line is tapped so I must be
brief

NEO
The Agents --

MORPHEUS (VO)
They got to you first but theyve
underestimated how important you
are If they knew what I know
you would probably be dead

NEO
What are you talking about What
the hell is happening to me

MORPHEUS (VO)
Youre the One Neo You see you
may have spent the last few years
looking for me but Ive spent
most of my life looking for you

Neo feels sick

MORPHEUS (VO)
Do you still want to meet

NEO
-- Yes

MORPHEUS (VO)
Go to the Adams Street bridge

CLICK He closes his eyes unsure of what he has done

22 EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

It is just beyond the middle of the night that time when
it seems there are no rules and everything feels unsafe
Neos boots scrape against the concrete Every pair of
eyes he passes seems to follow him Rain pours from a
black sky

As he reaches the bridge headlights creep in behind him
He turns just as the car slides quickly to a stop beside
him The back door opens

TRINITY
Get in

INT CAR
A large man named APOC is driving Beside him is a

beautiful androgyne called SWITCH aiming a large gun at
Neo WINDOW WIPERS BEAT HEAVILY against the windshield

NEO
What the hell is this
TRINITY
Its necessary Neo For our
protection
NEO
From what
TRINITY

From you

She lifts a strange steel and glass device that looks
like a cross between a rib separator speculum and air
compressor

SWITCH
Take off your shirt

He looks at the strange device and the gun still trained
on him

NEO
What Why
SWITCH
Stop the car
Apoc does
SWITCH

Listen to me coppertop We dont
have time for twenty questions’
Right now there is only one rule
Our way or the highway

Neo please you have to trust me

NEO
Why

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 25

TRINITY
Because youve been down there
Neo You already know that road
You know exactly where it ends

Neo stares out into the sheets of rain railing against
the dark street beyond the open door

TRINITY
And I know thats not where you
want to be

He closes the door

EXT DARK STREET

A moment later the green street lights curve over the
cars tinted windshield as it rushes through the wet
underworld

INT CAR

Neo grudgingly strips off his T-shirt

TRINITY
Lie back

Trinity aims the device at Neo its glass snout forming a
seal over his navel Switch snaps a cable into the front
seat cigarette lighter

NEO
What is this thing
TRINITY
We think youre bugged Try to

relax

She turns a dial and the machine bears down on Neos
midsection the cylinder sucking hard at his stomach

Neo screams squinting in pain as Trinity watches the
needle on a pressure gauge climb steadily

TRINITY
Come on come on

On a small monitor that projects an ultrasound-like
image we see Neos insides begin to slither and churn
He gasps as something wiggles beneath his skin inside his
stomach

Its on the move
TRINITY
Shit
SWITCH

Youre gonna lose it

TRINITY
No Im not Clear

The foreboding word hangs in Neos ear for a moment when
Trinity squeezes a trigger Electric current hammers
into Neo and rigid convulsions take hold of him beneath
the flickering car lamp until --

Something finally rockets wetly out of Neos stomach
through the extractors coils

NEO
Jesus Christ Its real
That thing is real
Trinity lifts a glass cage at the end of the tubing
Inside the small fluke-like bug flips and squirms its
tendrils flapping against the clear walls

She unrolls the window and dumps it out

It hits the pavement with a metallic tink reverted back
into a common wire tap as the car disappears into the

rainy night

EXT HOTEL LAFAYETTE 26
The car stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten

hotel

INT HOTEL LAFAYETTE 27

It is a place of putrefying elegance a rotting host of
urban maggotry

thirteenth floor They stop outside room 1313

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 27

Neo can hear his own heart pounding

TRINITY
Let me give one piece of advice
Be honest He knows more than you
can possibly imagine

INT ROOM 1313

Across the room a DARK FIGURE stares out the tall
windows veiled with decaying lace He turns and his
smile lights up the room A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes
the old building

MORPHEUS
At last

He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
behind circular mirrored glasses He strides to Neo and
they shake hands

MORPHEUS
Welcome Neo As you no doubt
have guessed I am Morpheus

NEO
Its an honor

MORPHEUS
No the honor is mine Please
Come Sit

He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an
adjacent room They sit across from one another in
cracked burgundy-leather chairs

MORPHEUS
I imagine right now you must be
feeling a bit like Alice tumbling
down the rabbit hole

NEO
You could say that

MORPHEUS
I can see it in your eyes You
have the look of a man who accepts
what he sees because he is
expecting to wake up

A smile razor-thin curls the corner of his lips

( )

MORPHEUS
Ironically this is not far from
the truth But Im getting ahead
of myself Can you tell me Neo
why are you here

NEO
Youre Morpheus Youre a legend
Most hackers would die to meet
you

MORPHEUS
Yes Thank you But I think we
both know theres more to it than
that Do you believe in fate

Neo

NEO
No

MORPHEUS
Why not

NEO

Because I dont like the idea that
Im not in control of my life

MORPHEUS
I know exactly what you mean

Again that smile that could cut glass

MORPHEUS
Let me tell you why you are here
You have come because you know
something What you know you
cant explain but you feel it
Youve felt it your whole life
felt that something is wrong with
the world You dont know what
but its there like a splinter in
your mind driving you mad It is
this feeling that brought you to
me Do you know what Im talking
about

NEO
The Matrix

MORPHEUS
Do you want to know what it is

Neo swallows hard and nods

( ) 28

MORPHEUS
The Matrix is everywhere its all
around us here even in this room
You can see it out your window or
on your television You feel it
when you go to work or go to
church or pay your taxes It is
the world that has been pulled
over your eyes to blind you from
the truth

NEO
What truth

MORPHEUS
That you are a slave Neo Like
everyone else you were born into
bondage kept inside a prison that
you cannot smell taste or touch
A prison for your mind

The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back

MORPHEUS
Unfortunately no one can be told
what the Matrix is You have to
see it for yourself

Morpheus opens his hands In the right is a red pill
In the left a blue pill

The pills

MORPHEUS
This is your last chance After
this there is no going back You
take the blue pill and the story
ends You wake in your bed and
you believe whatever you want to
believe

in his open hands are reflected in the glasses

MORPHEUS
You take the red pill and you stay
in Wonderland and I show you how
deep the rabbit-hole goes

Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules the moisture
growing in his palms

MORPHEUS
Remember that all I am offering is
the truth Nothing more

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 30

Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill The
Cheshire smile returns

MORPHEUS
Follow me

INT OTHER ROOM

He leads Neo into the other room which is cramped with
high-tech equipment glowing ash-blue and electric green
from the racks of monitors Trinity Apoc Switch and
Cypher look up as they enter

MORPHEUS
Apoc are we on-line

APOC
Almost

He and Trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex
system of monitors modules and drives

MORPHEUS
Neo time is always against us
Will you take a seat there

Neo sits in a chair in the center of the room and Trinity
begins gently fixing white electrode disks to him Near

the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked
He whispers to Trinity

NEO
You did all this

She nods placing a set of headphones over his ears
They are wired to an old hotel phone

MORPHEUS
The pill you took is part of a
trace program Its designed to
disrupt your inputoutput carrier
signal so we can pinpoint your
location

NEO
What does that mean

CYPHER
It means buckle up Dorothy
cause Kansas is going bye-bye

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 31

Distantly through the ear phones he hears Apoc POUNDING
on a KEYBOARD Sweat beads his face His eyes blink and
twitch when he notices the mirror

Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself a
webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
mirror were becoming liquid

NEO
Did you

Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
data Trinity monitors Neos electric vital signs Neo
reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear
beneath the rippling surface

Quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored taffy
stuck to his fingertips

MORPHEUS
Have you ever had a dream Neo
that you were so sure was real

A flash of lightning flickers white hot against Neo

NEO
This cant be

MORPHEUS
Be what Be real

The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away
until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break

MORPHEUS
What if you were unable to wake
from that dream Neo How would
you know the difference between
the dreamworld and the real world

Neo looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored
icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running
like wax down his fingers spreading across his palm
where he sees his face reflected

NEO
Uh-oh

TRINITY
Its going into replication

MORPHEUS
Apoc

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 32

APOC
Still nothing

Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number
MORPHEUS
Tank were going to need the

signal soon

The mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up
his arms like hundreds of insects

The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic
tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
mirror trying to keep his mouth up

NEO
Its cold

TRINITY
I got fibrillation

MORPHEUS
Shit Apoc

Streams of mercury run from Neos nose

APOC
Targeting almost there

An ALARM on Trinitys monitor ERUPTS

TRINITY
Hes going into arrest

APOC
Lock I got him

MORPHEUS
Now Tank now

His eyes tear with mirror rolling up and closing as a
HIGH-PITCHED ELECTRIC SCREAM erupts in the HEADPHONES

It is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to

another computer --

Neos body arches in agony and we are PULLED like we were
pulled INTO the holes of the phone sucked into his scream
and swallowed by darkness

INT POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MANS BODY

floating in a magenta amnion

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 33

His body spasms fighting against the thick gelatin

Metal tubes surreal versions of hospital tubes obscure
his face Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
and cover his genitals

He is struggling desperately now Air bubbles into the
Jell-O but does not break the surface Pressing up the
surface distends stretching like a red rubber cocoon

Unable to breathe he fights wildly to stand clawing at
the thinning elastic shroud until it ruptures a hole
widening around his mouth as he sucks for air Tearing
himself free he emerges from the cell

It is Neo

He is bald and naked his body slick with gelatin
Dizzy nauseous he waits for his vision to focus

He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
with magenta gelatin the surface of which has solidified
like curdled milk The IVs in his arms are plugged into
outlets that appear to be grafted to his flesh

He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
plugged and locked into the base of his skull He tries
to pull it out but it would be easier to pull off a
finger

To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
magenta gelatin beneath the wax-like surface pale and
motionless he sees other human beings

Fanning out in a circle there are more All connected
to a center core each capsule like a red dimly-glowing
petal attached to a black metal stem

Above him level after level the stem rises seemingly
forever He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
out The image assaults his mind

Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
heights disappearing down into a dim murk like an
underwater abyss

His sight is blurred and warped exaggerating the
intensity of the vision The sound of the plant is like
the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
Leviathan

( ) 30

From above a machine drops directly in front of Neo He
swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him It is
almost insect-like in its design beautiful housings of
alloyed metal covering organic-like systems of hard and
soft polymers

The machine seizes hold of Neo paralyzing him as the
cable lock at the back of his neck spins and opens

The cable disengages itself A long clear plastic
needle and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of
Neos skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid The
other connective hoses snap free and snake away as the
machine lets Neo go

Suddenly the back of the unit opens and a tremendous
vacuum like an airplane door opening sucks the gelatin
and then Neo into a black hole

INT WASTE LINE 31

The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls
sliding with the clot of gelatin

Banking through pipe spirals and elbows flushing up
through grease traps clogged with oily clumps of
cellulite

INT SEWER MAIN 32

Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
flow of waste

The metallic cable then lifts pulling him up into the

belly of the futuristic flying machine hovering inside

the sewer main

INT HOVERCRAFT 33
The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo
onto the floor Human hands and arms help him up as he
finds himself looking straight at Morpheus

He smiles

MORPHEUS
Welcome to the real world Neo

Neo passes out

FADE TO BLACK

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 35
FADE IN
INT HOVERCRAFT 34
We have no sense of time We hear voices whispering
MORPHEUS (0S)
Weve done it Trinity We found
him

TRINITY (0S)
I hope youre right

MORPHEUS (0S)
I dont have to hope it I know
it

Neos eyes flutter open We see Morpheus face above us
angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick

NEO (0S)
am I dead
MORPHEUS
Far from it
FADE TO BLACK
INT HOVERCRAFT - INFIRMARY 35

He opens his eyes again something tingling through him
He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device

DOZER
He still needs a lot of work

DOZER and Morpheus are operating on Neo

NEO
What are you doing

MORPHEUS
Your muscles have atrophied
Were rebuilding them
Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright

NEO
Why do my eyes hurt

MORPHEUS
Youve never used them before

Morpheus closes Neos eyes and Neo lays back

( )

35
MORPHEUS
Rest Neo The answers are
coming
INT NEOS ROOM 36

Neo wakes up from a deep sleep feeling better He begins
to examine himself There is a futuristic IV plugged into
the jack in his forearm He pulls it out staring at the

grafted outlet

He runs his hand over the short hair now covering his
head His fingers find and explore the large outlet in
the base of his skull

Just as he starts to come unglued Morpheus opens the
door

NEO
Morpheus whats happened to me
What is this place

MORPHEUS

More important than what is when
NEO

When
MORPHEUS

You believe the year is 1997 when
in fact it is much closer to 2197
I cant say for certain what year
it is because we honestly do not
know

The wind is knocked from Neos chest

MORPHEUS
There is no reason for me to try
to explain it when I can simply
show it Come with me

INT HOVERCRAFT 37

Like a sleepwalker Neo follows Morpheus through the
ship

MORPHEUS
This is my ship the
Nebuchadnezzar Its a
hovercraft

MORPHEUS (CONTD)
Small like a submarine Its
cramped and cold But its home

They climb a ladder up to the main deck

INT MAIN DECK
Everyone is there

MORPHEUS
This is the main deck You know
most of my crew

Trinity smiles and nods

MORPHEUS
The ones you dont know Thats
Mouse Cypher and Switch Those
two guys are Tank and Dozer

The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo

MORPHEUS
And this this is the Core This
is where we broadcast our pirate
signal and hack into the Matrix

It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment Vines of
coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
battery slabs a black portable satellite dish and banks
of life systems and computer monitors

At the center of the web there are six ecto-skeleton
chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness
Near the circle of chairs is the control console and
operators station where the network is monitored

MORPHEUS
You want to know what the Matrix
is Neo The answer is right
here

He touches the back of Neos head

MORPHEUS
Help him Trinity

Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs
He feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at
the back of his neck The cable has the same kind of
cerebrum chip we saw inside the plant

( )

38

MORPHEUS
This will feel a little weird

There are several disturbing noises as he works the
needle in

We MOVE IN as Neos shoulders bunch and his face tightens
into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop
like when you equalize them underwater

He relaxes opening his eyes as we PULL BACK to a feeling
of weightlessness inside another place --

INT CONSTRUCT 39
Neo is standing in an empty blank-white space

MORPHEUS
This is the Construct

Startled Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the
room with him

MORPHEUS
It is our loading program We can
load anything from clothes to
weapons to training simulations
Anything we need

Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the
two leather chairs from the Hotel Lafayette set up in
front of a large screen television

MORPHEUS
Sit down

Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits

NEO
Right now were inside a computer
program
Morpheus smiles
MORPHEUS

Is it so hard to believe Your
clothes are different the plugs
in your arms and head are gone
Look at your hair you were bald a
moment ago

Neo touches his head

( )

MORPHEUS
Its what we call residual self
image The mental projection of
your electronic self Wild isnt
it

Neos hands run over the cracked leather

NEO
This -- This isnt real

MORPHEUS
What is real How do you define
real If youre talking about
what you feel taste smell or
see then real is simply
electrical signals interpreted by
your brain

He picks up a remote control and clicks on the
television On the television we see images of the
Twentieth Century city where Neo lived

MORPHEUS
This is the world you know The
world as it was at the end of the
Twentieth Century It exists now
only as part of a neural-
interactive simulation that we
call the Matrix

He changes the channel and we see a very different city
as we enter the television

MORPHEUS
You have been living inside a
dreamworld Neo As in
Baudrillards vision your whole
life has been spent inside the
map not the territory This is
the world as it exists today

In the distance we see the ruins of a future city
protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
a long-dead corpse

MORPHEUS
The desert of the real

Beneath us the water is gone

( ) 39

We TURN AND DESCEND SPIRALING DOWN TOWARD the lake bed
which is scorched and split like burnt flesh where we
FIND Morpheus and Neo Neo clings to the chair trying
to get his bearings

MORPHEUS
We have only bits and pieces of
information What we know for
certain is that at some point in
the early Twenty-first Century
all of mankind was united in
celebration Through the blinding
inebriation of hubris we marveled
at our magnificence as we gave
birth to AI

NEO
AI You mean artificial
intelligence

MORPHEUS

Yes A singular consciousness
that spawned an entire race of
machines I must say I find it
almost funny to imagine the world
slapping itself on the back
toasting the new age I say
almost funny

He looks up and his sunglasses reflect the obsidian
clouds roiling overhead

MORPHEUS
We dont know who struck first
Us or them But we do know it was
us that scorched the sky At the
time they were dependent on solar
power It was believed they would
be unable to survive without an
energy source as abundant as the
sun

As we DESCEND INTO the circular window of his glasses
there is a flash of lightning

MORPHEUS
Throughout human history we have
been dependent on machines to
survive Fate it seems is not
without a sense of irony

A40

EXT FETUS FIELDS 40

On the flash we PULL BACK from the darkness which
reveals itself to be the black eye of a fetus

MORPHEUS
The Machines discovered a new form
of fusion All they needed was a
small electrical charge to
initiate the reaction

The fetus is suspended in a placenta-like husk where its
malleable skull is already growing around the brain-jack

MORPHEUS
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt
battery and over 25000 BTUs
of body heat

The husk hanging from a stalk is plucked by a thresher-
like farm machine

MORPHEUS
There are fields endless fields
where human beings are no longer
born we are grown

We RISE UP the field stretching in every direction to
the horizon lightning tearing open the sky as a
harvester sweeps past us

INT POWER PLANT A40

From the yawning black of the waste port we begin to
PULL BACK as it snaps shut

Red amniotic gel flows into the pod below us pooling
around a tiny newborn that suckles its feed tube

MORPHEUS
For the longest time I wouldnt
believe it But then I saw the
fields with my own eyes watched
them liquefy the dead so they
could be fed intravenously to the
living and standing there facing
the efficiency the pure
horrifying precision I came to
realize the obviousness of the
truth

Still PULLING BACK we see the image of the power plant
now on the television as we return to the white space of
the construct

INT CONSTRUCT 41
Morpheus steps INTO VIEW as he clicks off the television

MORPHEUS
What is the Matrix Control

He opens the back of the television remote control

MORPHEUS
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dreamworld built to keep us under
control in order to change a human
being into this

He holds up a coppertop battery

NEO
No I dont believe it Its not
possible

MORPHEUS

I didnt say that it would be
easy Neo I just said that it
would be the truth

NEO
Stop Let me out I want out

INT MAIN DECK 42

His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair
trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck

NEO
Get this thing out of me

TRINITY
Easy Neo Easy

Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it Once its out
he tears away from them falling as he trips free of the
harness

NEO
Dont touch me Get away from me

On his hands and knees he reels as the world spins
Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
as if his brain had been put into a centrifuge

NEO
I dont believe it I dont
believe it

( )

42

CYPHER
Hes going to pop

Vomiting violently Neo pitches forward and blacks out

INT NEOS ROOM 43

He blinks regaining consciousness The room is dark
Neo is stretched out on his bed

NEO
I cant go back can I

Morpheus is sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
corner

MORPHEUS
No But if you could would you
really want to

Deep down Neo knows that answer

MORPHEUS
I feel that I owe you an apology
There is a rule that we do not
free a mind once it reaches a
certain age It is dangerous
They have trouble letting go
Their mind turns against them
Ive seen it happen Im sorry
I broke the rule because I had to

He stares into the darkness confessing as much to
himself as to Neo

MORPHEUS
When the Matrix was first built
there was a man born inside that
had the ability to change what he
wanted to remake the Matrix as he
saw fit It was this man that
freed the first of us and taught
us the truth as long as the
Matrix exists the human race will
never be free

He pauses

( )

44

43

MORPHEUS
When he died the Oracle
prophesied his return and
envisioned that his coming would
hail the destruction of the
Matrix an end to the war and
freedom for our people That is
why there are those of us that
have spent our entire lives
searching the Matrix looking for
him

Neo can feel his eyes on him
MORPHEUS
I did what I did because I believe
the search is over
He stands up
MORPHEUS
Get some rest Youre going to

need it

NEO
For what

MORPHEUS
Your training

INT HOVERCRAFT 44

There is no morning there is only darkness and then the
fluorescent light sticks flicker on

Tank doesnt have any jacks

warm You live long enough you
might even see it

Goddamn I got to tell you Im
fairly excited to see what you are
capable of I mean if Morpheus is
right and all Were not supposed
to talk about any of that but if
you are well then this is an
exciting time We got a lot to do
so lets get to it

Were supposed to load all these
operations programs first but
this is some major boring shit
Why dont we start with something
a little fun

Tank smiles as he plops into his operators chair He
begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
discs

TANK
How about some combat training

Neo reads the label on the disk

NEO
Jujitsu Im going to learn
jujitsu

Tank slides the disk into Neos supplement drive

NEO
No way

Smiling Tank punches the load code His body jumps
against the harness as his eyes clamp shut The monitors
kick wildly as his heart pounds adrenaline surges and
his brain sizzles An instant later his eyes snap open

NEO
Holy shit

TANK
Hey Mikey he likes it Ready
for more

NEO
Hell yes

Neos body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open breath
hissing from his lips He looks like he just orgasmed

NEO
This is incredible I know kung
fu

MORPHEUS
Show me

INT DOJO
They are standing in a very sparse Japanese-style dojo

MORPHEUS
This is a sparring program
similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix It has the same
basic rules Rules like gravity
What you must learn is that these
rules are no different than the
rules of a computer system Some
of them can be bent Others can
be broken Understand

Neo nods as Morpheus assumes a fighting stance

MORPHEUS
Then hit me if you can

Neo assumes a similar stance cautiously circling until
he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack

It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed fists and
feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
but each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed

INT MAIN DECK

While their minds battle in the programmed reality the
two bodies appear quite serene suspended in the drive
chairs

Tank monitors their Life Systems noticing that Neo is
wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
steady rhythm of Morpheus

MOUSE bursts into the room interrupting dinner

Morpheus is fighting Neo

All at once everyone bolts for the door

INT DOJO 51

Neos face is knotted teeth clenched as he hurls
himself at Morpheus

MORPHEUS
Good Adaptation Improvisation
But your weakness isnt your
technique

Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen
His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart For
every blow Neo blocks five more hit their marks until --

Neo falls

Panting on his hands and knees blood spits from his
mouth speckling the white floor of the dojo

MORPHEUS
How did I beat you
NEO
You -- Youre too fast
MORPHEUS

Do you think my being faster
stronger has anything to do with
my muscles in this place
Neo is frustrated still unable to catch his breath
MORPHEUS
Do you believe thats air you are
breathing now

Neo stands nodding slowly

MORPHEUS
Again

Their fists fly with pneumatic speed

Everyone is gathered behind Tank watching the fight
like watching a game of Mortal Kombat

slipping in several stinging slaps

waiting for Youre faster than

you are

Whack Morpheus cracks Neo again Neos face twists with
rage as the speed of the blows rises like a drum solo

head knocking off his glasses

rush up at them until they are standing on a rooftop ina
city skyline

MORPHEUS
Let it all go Neo Fear Doubt
Disbelief Free your mind

Morpheus spins running hard at the edge of the rooftop
And jumps He sails through the air his coat billowing
out behind him like a cape as he lands on the rooftop
across the street

Neo looks down at the street twenty floor below then at
Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away

NEO

No problem

He takes a deep breath And starts to run

whispers

EXT ROOFTOP 59

Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs Neo
launches himself into the air in a single maniacal
shriek--

-- but comes up drastically short

His eyes widen as he plummets Stories fly by the

ground rushing up at him but as he hits the ground gives
way stretching like a trapeze net He bounces and flips
slowly coming to a rest flat on his back

He laughs a bit unsure wiping the windblown tears from
his face Morpheus exits the building and helps him to
his feet

MORPHEUS
Do you know why you didnt make
it

NEO

Because I didnt think I would

Morpheus smiles and nods

She sees him passed out on the bed She sets the tray
down and pulls the blanket over him

She pauses her face close to his then inhales lightly
breathing in the scent of him before slowly pulling away

him to the Oracle She would
know

Morpheus will take him when hes
ready

She turns and he watches her walk away

EXT CITY STREET - TRAINING PROGRAM - DAY 63

Morpheus moves effortlessly through a crowded downtown

carpenters The minds of the very
people we are trying to save But
until we do these people are
still a part of the system and
that makes them our enemy

A cop writing a parking ticket stares at Neo from behind
his sunglasses

MORPHEUS
You have to understand that most
of these people are not ready to
be unplugged and many of them are
so inured so hopelessly dependent
on the system that they will fight
to protect it

A beautiful woman in a red dress smiles at Neo as she

passes by

MORPHEUS
Were you listening to me Neo Or
were you looking at the woman in
the red dress

NEO
I was

MORPHEUS
Look again

Neo turns just as Agent Smith levels a gun at his face

Neo screams

MORPHEUS
Freeze it

Everything except Morpheus and Neo freezes

NEO
This -- this isnt the Matrix

MORPHEUS
No its another training program
designed to teach you one thing
if you are not one of us youre
one of them

NEO
What are they

MORPHEUS
Sentient programs They can move
in and out of any software still
hardwired to their system That
means that anyone that we havent
unplugged is potentially an Agent
Inside the Matrix they are
everyone and they are no one

Neo stares at the Agent

MORPHEUS
Weve survived by hiding from
them running from them but they
are the gatekeepers theyre
guarding all the doors holding
all the keys which means that
sooner or later someone is going
to have to fight them

NEO
Someone

MORPHEUS
I wont lie to you Neo Every
single man or woman who has stood
their ground who has fought an
Agent has died But where they
failed you will succeed

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 55

NEO
Why

MORPHEUS
Ive seen an Agent punch through a
concrete wall Men have emptied
entire clips at them and hit
nothing but air Yet their
strength and their speed are still
based on a world that is built by
rules Because of that they will
never be as strong or as fast as
you can be

Neo scratches his head
NEO
What Are you trying to tell me
that I can dodge bullets
MORPHEUS
No Neo Im trying to tell you
that when youre ready you wont
have to

EXT SEWER MAIN

The Nebuchadnezzar blisters by trailing a swirling
supercharged electromagnetic wake

INT COCKPIT

Morpheus slides into the copilots chair next to Dozer

MORPHEUS
Did Zion send the warning

DOZER
No Another ship Big Brother I
think theyre running a parallel
pipeline
Morpheus scans the decayed landscape of the sewer main
that rolls by as Neo and Trinity squeeze into the cockpit
behind him An ALARM BEGINS TO SOUND

Tank works furiously at the operators station as the
ceaseless WHIR of the ships TURBINES GRIND TO a HALT
The main deck is plunged into dark silence The rest

TRINITY
An electromagnetic pulse It
disables any electrical system in

Dozer looks up

DOZER
Now we wait

THROUGH the cockpits windshield the vast cavern of the
sewer main yawns before them Strands of green haze curl
round mossy icicles that dangle into a pool of churning
frozen waste Neo begins to angle around Dozer but
Morpheus grabs him

MORPHEUS
Dont move Itll hear you

Neo freezes and they wait Without the Nebuchadnezzars
heating systems the temperature in the cockpit begins to
rapidly drop The crew members huddle together their
breath freezing into a uniform cloud as it gets colder
and colder

Dozer quietly reaches to brush away the frost on the
windshield and as his hand clears a swath --

They see it

In the darkness a shifting shadow of mechanized death
It is beautiful and terrifying Black alloy skin
flickers like sequins beneath sinewy coils and skeletal
appendages

Neo can feel the hairs on the back of his neck rise as it
silently glides over them with shark-like malevolence
until it disappears into the darkness

In the frozen little room everyone breathes a little
easier

The ship is quiet and dark Everyone is asleep

The core glows with monitor light Cypher is in the

CYPHER
Whoa Shit Neo you scared the

NEO
Sorry

CYPHER
No its all right

Neos eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
that seem alive with a constant flow of data

NEO
Is that

CYPHER
The Matrix Yeah

Neo stares at the endlessly shifting river of
information bizarre codes and equations flowing across
the face of the monitor

NEO
Do you always look at it encoded

CYPHER
Have to The image translators
sort of work for the construct
programs but theres way too much
information to decode the Matrix
You get used to it though Your
brain does the translating I
dont even see the code All I
see is blonde brunette and
redhead You want a drink

Neo nods and he pours a clear alcohol from a plastic jug

CYPHER
You know I know what youre
thinking cause right now Im
thinking the same thing
Actually to tell you the truth
Ive been thinking the same thing
ever since I got here

He raises the glass

( )

THE MATRIX - Rev 3998 59

CYPHER
Why oh why didnt I take that
blue pill

He throws the shot down his throat Neo does the same
and it almost kills him Smiling Cypher slaps him on
the back

CYPHER
Good shit eh Dozer makes it
Its good for two things
degreasing engines and killing
brain cells

Red-faced Neo finally stops coughing Cypher pours him
another

CYPHER
Can I ask you something Did he
happen to tell you why he did it

Neo looks up unsure

CYPHER
Why youre here
NEO
- Yeah
CYPHER

Gee-zus What a mindjob Youre
here to save the world You gotta
be shitting me What do you say
to something like that

Neo looks down at his drink

CYPHER
Im going to let you in ona
little secret here Now dont
tell him I told you this but this
aint the first time Morpheus
thought he found the One

NEO
Really

CYPHER
You bet your ass It keeps him

take on an Agent and I watched
each of them die Little piece of

off

Neo gulps down another shot

NEO
Thanks for the drink

CYPHER

Cypher nods as Neo heads for the ladder

CYPHER
Sweet dreams

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT A71

CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the
restaurant around us as we watch a serrated knife saw
through a thick gorgeous steak The meat is so perfect
charred on the outside oozing red juice from the inside
that it could be a dream

We hear a voice that we recognize immediately

AGENT SMITH
Do we have a deal Mr Reagan

A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the

face of Cypher

A71 A71

CYPHER
You know I know that this steak
doesnt exist I know when I put
it in my mouth the Matrix is
telling my brain that it is juicy
and delicious After nine years
do you know what Ive realized

He shoves it in eyes rolling up savoring the tender
beef melting in his mouth

CYPHER
Ignorance is bliss

Agent Smith watches him chew the steak loudly smacking
it between his teeth

CYPHER
Mmm so so goddamn good

AGENT SMITH
Then we have a deal

CYPHER
I dont want to remember nothing
Nothing You understand And I
want to be rich Someone
important Like an actor You
can do that right

AGENT SMITH
Whatever you want Mr Reagan

Cypher takes a deep drink of wine

CYPHER
All right You get my body back
in a power plant reinsert me into

CLOSE ON breakfast a substance with a consistency

somewhere between yogurt and cellulite

TANK
Here you go buddy Breakfast of

Tank slides it in front of Neo and takes a seat with the

other crew members enjoying breakfast

APOC
You mean the breakfast lunch and
dinner of champions

MOUSE
If you close your eyes it almost
feels like youre eating runny

eggs

APOC
Or a bowl of snot

MOUSE
But you know what it really
reminds me of Cream of Wheat
Did you ever eat Cream of Wheat

SWITCH
No but technically neither did
you

MOUSE

Exactly my point because you have
to wonder how do the machines
know what Cream of Wheat really
tasted like Maybe they got it
wrong maybe what I think Cream of
Wheat tasted like actually tasted
like oatmeal or tuna fish It
makes you wonder about a lot of
things Take chicken for example
Maybe they couldnt figure out
what to make chicken taste like
which is why chicken tastes like
everything And maybe --

APOC
Shut up Mouse

Neo scoops up a spoonful

So I understand youve run

MOUSE
So what did you think of her

NEO
Of who

MOUSE
The woman in the red dress I
designed her She doesnt talk
much but if youd like to you
know meet her I could arrange
a more personalized milieu

SWITCH
The digital pimp hard at work

Pay no attention to these

Neo steps back into the Matrix He squints at the sun
which seems unnaturally bright He is the only one

without sunglasses

Apoc and Switch remain at the door as the others enter
the alley

MORPHEUS
We should be back in an hour

Cypher opens the drivers door of an old car as Trinity
Morpheus and Neo cross to the car Cypher glances about
quickly then drops something inside a garbage can

It is a cellular phone and we see its blue display as the

INT CAR

Neo sits beside Trinity in the back He cannot stop
staring as the simple images of the urban street blur
past his window like an endless stream of data rushing

down a computer screen

MORPHEUS
Almost unbelievable isnt it

Neo nods as the car continues to wind through the crowded
city

TRINITY
What
NEO

I used to eat there Really good
noodles

He is speaking in a whisper almost as if talking to
himself

NEO
I have these memories from my
entire life but none of them
really happened

He turns to her

NEO
What does that mean

TRINITY
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are

NEO
But an Oracle can

TRINITY
Thats different

NEO
Obviously

He turns to the window for a moment and then turns back

NEO
Did you go to her

TRINITY
Yes

NEO

What did she tell you

TRINITY
She told me

She looks at him and suddenly she is unable to speak or
even breathe

( ) 74

NEO
What

The car suddenly jerks to a stop

Were here Neo come with me

Neo and Morpheus get out of the car Cypher looks into
the rearview mirror at Trinity

He smiles as she turns to the window

EXT BUILDING 75

Tenement-like and vast it is the kind of place where
people can disappear

Morpheus nods to a blind man who nods back An elevator
opens and Neo follows Morpheus inside

INT ELEVATOR 77

The idea of learning ones fate begins to weigh upon Neo
with a steadily growing unease

NEO
So is this the same oracle that
made the uh prophecy

MORPHEUS
Yes Shes very old Shes been
with us since the beginning

NEO
The beginning

MORPHEUS
Of the Resistance

NEO
And she knows what Everything

MORPHEUS
She would say she knows enough

NEO
And shes never wrong

MORPHEUS
Dont think of it in terms of
right and wrong She is a guide
Neo She can help you find the

path
NEO
She helped you
MORPHEUS
Yes
NEO

What did she tell you

MORPHEUS
That I would find the One

DING The ELEVATOR opens

INT HALL 78

The long dark hall beckons Neo follows Morpheus out of
the elevator and the DOORS RATTLE shut behind him With
every step a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in
around him

At the end of the hall Morpheus steps to the side of a
door

MORPHEUS
I told you that I can only show
you the door You have to step
through it

Neo blows out a breath His hand reaches but stops
hovering over the spherical handle He backs away

NEO
Morpheus I dont think this is a
good idea

MORPHEUS
Why

NEO
I told you I dont believe in this
stuff No matter what she says
Im not going to believe it so
whats the point

( )

MORPHEUS
What do you believe in

NEO
What do I believe in Are you
kidding me What do you think
The world I grew up in isnt real
My entire life was a lie I dont
believe in anything anymore

MORPHEUS
Thats why were here

NEO
Why So I can hear some old lady
tell me what That Im this guy
that everybodys been waiting for
That Im supposed to save the
world It sounds insane
Unbelievable And I dont care
who says it its still going to
sound insane and unbelievable

MORPHEUS
Faith is not a matter of
reasonability I do not believe
things with my mind I believe
them with my heart In my gut

NEO

And you believe Im the One
MORPHEUS

Yes I do
NEO

Yeah What about the other five
guys The five before me What
about them

Morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his
chest

NEO
Did you believe in them too

MORPHEUS
I believed what the Oracle told
me no I misunderstood what she
told me I believed that it was
all about me

This is difficult for Morpheus to admit

( ) 78

MORPHEUS
I believed that all I had to do
was point my finger and anoint
whoever I chose I was wrong
Neo Terribly wrong Not a day
or night passes that I do not
think of them After the fifth I
lost my way I doubted everything
the Oracle had said I doubted
myself

He looks up at Neo

MORPHEUS
And then I saw you Neo and my
world changed You can call it
an epiphany you can call it
whatever the hell you want
It doesnt matter Its not
about a word Its about this
So I cant explain it to you
All I can do is believe Neo
believe that one day you will
feel what I felt and know what
I know you are the sixth and
the last You are the One

His eyes blaze
MORPHEUS
Until that time all I am asking
from you is for you to hold on to
whatever respect you may have for
me and trust me

Neo feels a rush from Morpheuss intensity the
unadulterated confidence of a zealot

NEO
All right

He reaches for the handle which turns without him even
touching it A WOMAN wearing white opens the door

PRIESTESS (WOMAN)
Hello Neo Youre right on time
INT ORACLES APARTMENT 79
It seems particularly normal

PRIESTESS
Make yourself at home Morpheus

MORPHEUS
Thank you

PRIESTESS
Neo come with me

She leads Neo down another hall and into what appears to
be a family room

There is another woman in white sitting on a couch
watching a soap opera Scattered about the room are a
half dozen children Some of them are playing others are
deep in meditation All of them exude a kind of Zen calm

PRIESTESS
These are the other Potentials
You can wait here

Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
blocks Closer to him a SKINNY BOY with a shaved head
holds a spoon which sways like a blade of grass

In front of him is a pile of spoons bent and twisted into
knots Neo crosses to him and sits The boy smiles and
hands Neo the spoon which is now perfectly straight

SPOON BOY (SKINNY BOY)
Do not try to bend the spoon
That is impossible Instead only
try to realize the truth

NEO
What truth

SPOON BOY
That there is no spoon

Neo nods staring at the spoon

NEO
There is no spoon

SPOON BOY
Then you will see that it is not
the spoon that bends It is only
yourself

The entire room is reflected inside the spoon and as Neo
stares into it it slowly begins to bend until --

A hand touches his shoulder

PRIESTESS
The Oracle will see you now

Spoon Boy smiles

She gestures to a wooden plaque the kind every kitchen
has except that the words are in Latin

ORACLE
You know what that means Its
Latin Means Know Thyself
Im gonna let you in on a little
secret Being the One is just
like being in love Nobody can
tell you youre in love You just

Balls to bones

She puts her cigarette down
ORACLE
Well I better have a look at you
Open your mouth Say ‘ahh

She widens his eyes checks his ears then feels the
glands in his neck She nods then looks at his palms

( ) 80

ORACLE
Okay now Im supposed to say
‘Hmmm thats interesting but
Then you say --

NEO

But you already know what Im
going to tell you

NEO

Whats funny

NEO
Morpheus He almost had me
convinced

ORACLE
I know Poor Morpheus Without
him we are lost

NEO
What do you mean without him

The Oracle takes a long drag regarding Neo with the eyes
of a Sphinx

Neo nods

ORACLE
Are you sure you want to hear
this

( ) 80

ORACLE
Morpheus believes in you Neo and
no one not you or even me can
convince him otherwise He
believes it so blindly that hes
going to sacrifice his life to
save yours

NEO
What

ORACLE
Youre going to have to make a
choice In one hand you will
have Morpheuss life In the
other hand you will have your
own One of you is going to die
Which one will be up to you

Neo cant breathe

ORACLE
Im sorry kiddo I really am
You have a good soul and I hate
giving good people bad news But
dont worry as soon as you walk

beginning to fade

About to whirl back in he freezes as something seems to
seize hold of him The Cops body starts to spasm and
his M-16 falls to the ground long shadows springing up
from the mounted flashlight

INT WALL — DAY 115

Neo listens for a moment the gunfire quiet when he
hears FOOTSTEPS RISING FAST

Two arms suddenly smash through the wall punching Neo
back against the iron stack pipe fingers gouging into
his neck

CYPHER
Its an Agent

Just as Neos throat is about to collapse Morpheus
explodes through the tattered plaster and lath diving on
top of Agent Smith

The two men crash to the wet terrazzo floor

Before Agent Smith can find his weapon Morpheus is on
him pinning him in an iron grip

In the crawlspace Trinity tries to scramble up past
Cypher

TRINITY
Morpheus

Morpheus squeezes Agent Smiths throat
MORPHEUS
Trinity you must get Neo out Do
you understand He is all that
matters

Neo suddenly glimpses what is happening but is powerless
to stop it

NEO
No No Morpheus Dont

MORPHEUS
Trinity Go

Trinitys fists ball in frustration She yells down to
Apoc

TRINITY
Go

NEO
We cant leave him

TRINITY
We have to

She grabs his ankle and they begin almost falling using
the lath as a brake skidding down the inside of the
wall

INT BASEMENT - DAY 116

This part of the basement a dark concrete cavern was
the main mechanical room There are four enormous
boilers dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot
water like arteries

Soldiers blinding lights cut open the darkness as
Trinity Neo and the others crash through the ceiling
Around them they hear a chorus of short sharp coughs of
grenade launchers from gas-masked figures

Smoke blossoms from the green metal canisters Trinity
never stops moving Searching the floor she finds what
she needs the cover of the catch basin

Cypher watches her pry open the grate when a gas can
bounces near him

TRINITY
Come on

Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him

Trinity watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then

follow the others down the wet-black hole

INT ROOM 608 - DAY 117

Morpheus and Agent Smith remain on the ground locked in
each others death grip

AGENT SMITH
The great Morpheus We meet at
last

MORPHEUS
And you are

AGENT SMITH
Smith I am Agent Smith

( )

117

MORPHEUS
You all look the same to me

Agent Smith counters Morpheus and slowly begins to pry
his hands from his throat Striking like a viper
Morpheus drives a vicious head butt into Agent Smiths
face His nose and glasses shatter

Agent Smith unfazed smiles blood oozing from the
shattered bridge of his nose and returns Morpheuss head
butt with three of his own in pneumatic succession

Morpheus staggers back his body going slack when another
kick buries him deep into crunching plaster and lathe

Morpheus turns in time to see a wall of men in the
doorway

AGENT SMITH
Take him

The wall of cops rushes Morpheus filling the tiny
bathroom until he disappears under the tide

EXT GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY

A government highrise in the middle of downtown where a
military helicopter sets down on the roof

Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter flanked by
columns of Marines They open the roof access door and
enter the top floor maintenance level of the hotel

INT EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY

Agent Smith stands staring out the windows at the city
below shimmering with brilliant sunlight

( )

AGENT SMITH
Have you ever stood and stared at
it Morpheus Marveled at its
beauty Its genius Billions of
people just living out their
lives oblivious

Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair stripped to the waist
He is alternately shivering and sweating wired to
various monitors with white disk electrodes Beside him
Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial filling a
hypodermic needle

AGENT SMITH
Did you know that the first Matrix
was designed to be a perfect human
world Where none suffered where
everyone would be happy It was a
disaster No one would accept the
program Entire crops were lost

Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheuss shoulder and
plunges down

AGENT SMITH
Some believed we lacked the
programming language to describe
your perfect world But I believe
that as a species human beings
define their reality through
suffering and misery

Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
violently to the injection

AGENT SMITH
The perfect world was a dream that
your primitive cerebrum kept
trying to wake up from Which is
why the Matrix was redesigned to
this the peak of your
civilization

He turns from the window

AGENT SMITH
I say ‘your civilization because
as soon as we started thinking for
you it really became our
civilization which is of course
what this is all about

He sits down directly in front of Morpheus

AGENT SMITH
Evolution Morpheus Evolution

He lifts Morpheuss head

AGENT SMITH
Like the dinosaur Look out that
window You had your time

Morpheus stares hard at him trying not to show the pain
racking his mind

Theyre breaking into his mind
Its like hacking a computer All
it takes is time

NEO
How much time

TANK
Depends on the mind But
eventually it will crack and his
alpha pattern will change from
this to this

Tank punches several commands on Morpheuss personal
unit The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to
an ordered symmetrical one

TANK
When it does Morpheus will tell
them anything they want to know

NEO
What do they want

TANK
The leader of every ship is given
the codes to Zions mainframe
computer If an Agent had those
codes and got inside Zions
mainframe they could destroy us

He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly

TANK
We cant let that happen Trinity
Zion is more important than me
Or you or even Morpheus

Trinity sees Cyphers dead body Rage overtakes her and
she kicks him

Neo suddenly sees it perfectly clear fate rushing at him
like an oncoming train

tears slip free

Tank closes his eyes and takes hold of the plug

Neo is paralyzed his whole life is suddenly suspended by
the finality of this moment hurling at him with the speed
of a bullet

What choice

He makes his choice Turning he walks to his chair

TRINITY
What are you doing
NEO
Im going in

Morpheus sacrificed himself so we
could get you out Theres no way
youre going back in

he believed that Im something Im
not

NEO
Im not the One Trinity The
Oracle hit me with that too

Trinity is stunned

TRINITY
No you have to be
NEO

Im sorry Im not Im just
another guy Morpheus is the one
that matters

TRINITY
No Neo Thats not true It
cant be true

NEO
Why

TRINITY
Because

Uncertainty swallows her words and she is unable to tell
him what she wants to

TANK
Neo this is loco Theyve got
Morpheus in a military controlled
building Even if you somehow got
inside those are Agents holding
him Three of them I want
Morpheus back too but what you
are talking about is suicide

NEO
I know thats what it looks like
but its not I cant logically
explain to you why its not
Morpheus believed something and he
was ready to give his life for
what he believed I understand
that now Thats why I have to

go

Why
NEO

Because I believe in something
TRINITY

NEO

I believe I can bring him back

Trinity stares at him hovering on the edge that he just

jumped off Her jaw sets and she starts climbing into
the chair beside him

NEO
What are you doing
TRINITY
Im coming with you
NEO
No youre not
TRINITY

No Let me tell you what I
believe I believe Morpheus means
more to me than he does to you I
believe that if you are serious
about saving him then you are
going to need my help and since I
am the ranking officer on this
ship if you dont like it then I
believe that you can go to hell
because you arent going anywhere
else

There is nothing more to say except --

INT EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY 144

Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is
hunched over his body leaking and twitching

AGENT SMITH
Id like to share a revelation
that Ive had during my time here
It came to me when I tried to
classify your species Ive
realized that you are not actually
mammals

instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding
environment But you humans do
not

This prison This reality
whatever you want to call it I
cant stand it any longer Its
the smell if there is such a
thing I feel saturated by it I
can taste your stink and every
time I do I fear that Ive
somehow been infected by it

He wipes sweat from Morpheus forehead coating the tips
of his fingers holding them to Morpheus nose

AGENT SMITH
Repulsive isnt it

He lifts Morpheus head holding it tightly with both
hands

AGENT SMITH
I must get out of here I must get

Once Zion is destroyed there is
no need for me to be here Do you

A fourth guard dives for cover clutching his radio

He looks up as Trinity sets off the metal detector It is

the last thing he sees

The backup arrives A wave of soldiers blocking the
elevators The concrete cavern of the lobby becomes a
white noise ROAR of GUNFIRE

Slate walls and pillars pock crack and crater
under a hail storm of EXPLOSIVE-tipped BULLETS

They are met by the quivering spit of a SUB-HAND MACHINE
GUN and the RAZORED WHISTLE of throwing knives Weapons
like extensions of their bodies are used with the same
deadly precision as their feet and their fists

Bodies slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and

through the shaft as the elevator falls away beneath them

Across the roof the PILOT inside the army helicopter
watches the last of their ferocious onslaught

Suddenly his face his whole body dissolves consumed by
spreading locust-like swarm of static as Agent Jones
emerges

Just as she drops the final Marine Trinity sees whats
coming Neo sees her the fear in her face and he knows
what is behind him

Screaming he whirls guns filling his hands with

Fingers pumping shells ejecting dancing up and away we
look THROUGH the sights and gun smoke AT the Agent
blurred with motion --

Until the hammers click against the empty metal

Agent Jones charges

coming faster until Neo bent impossibly back one hand
on the ground as a spiraling gray ball shears open his
shoulder

He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
his thigh He has only time to look up to see Agent

click

Immediately he whirls around and turns straight into the
muzzle of Trinitys 45 --

And as Morpheus starts his dive for the window a bullet
buries itself in his leg knocking him off balance

He wont make it

Morpheus lunges out of control --

As Neo spins every move a whip crack snapping the other

attached to a machine

As their two bodies set in motion rushing at each other
on a seemingly magnetic course until they collide

Almost bouncing free of each other arms legs
scrambling hands searching in furious desperation
finding hold and clinging

Until the LINE ends SNAPPING taut cracking their

Neo and Morpheus drop safely rolling free as the rope
goes slack Neo gets to his feet trying to detach
himself but --

The helicopter is falling too fast arcing over the roof
like a setting sun --

The coils of slack snap taut yanking Neo off his feet
dragging him with ferocious speed towards the edge even as --

Trinity lunges for the back door her gun in one hand
grabbing for the rope with the other --

Neo flies like a skipping stone hurtling at the parapet
when his feet hit the rain gutter and he levers up just
as --

Trinity fires severing the cord from the helicopter
falling free of it as it SMASHES blades first into a
GLASS skyscraper

Holding on to the rope she swings connected to Neo who
stands on the buildings edge watching her arc beneath
him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --

She bounces against a shatterproof WINDOW that SPIDER-
CRACKS out while flames erupt behind her

INT SUBWAY STATION - DAY

An old man sits hunched in the far corner of the station
shadows gathered around him like blankets

Mumbling he nurses from a bottle of Thunderbird when --

A PHONE begins to RING

Neo leads Trinity and Morpheus bounding over a set of
turnstiles towards the ringing phone inside a graffiti-

covered booth

NEO
Lets go You first Morpheus

Morpheus gets in and answers the phone

Lost in the shadow the old man watches as Morpheus
disappears the phone dropping dangling by its cord
His eyes grow wide glowing white in the dark

EXT ROOFTOP - DAY 171

Agent Smith stares his face twisted with hate He will
never be free of the Matrix

He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
suddenly hears it his head whipping back around
staring--

INT SUBWAY - OLD MANS POV - DAY 172
Through the old mans eyes as the world begins to RUMBLE
Trinity hangs up the phone then turns to Neo

TRINITY
Neo I have to tell you something
I dont know what it means or even
if it matters but I feel I have to
say it

The RUMBLE GROWS the ground beginning to shake

TRINITY
Ive never told anyone this
before I think Ive been afraid
to

Behind her the PHONE begins to RING
TRINITY
When I went to the Oracle she
told me she told me that I was
going to fall in love But

The RUMBLE RISES drowning her voice Neo is drawn
towards her their lips close enough to kiss when a TRAIN
BLASTS into the station

For a moment they are frozen by the strobing lights of
the train until Neo whispers in her ear

NEO
Promise me youll tell me the
rest

She nods as he closes the booth The PHONE RINGS once
more before she lifts the receiver when In the darkness
of the far corner Neo sees the old man in the flashing
train-light as he becomes --

Agent Smith raising a fistful of black gun-metal

NEO
No

The GUN FIRES the BULLET flying at her BURSTING through
the PLASTIC WINDOW just as Trinity disappears

The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS
SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE

Slowly he turns back and in his eyes we see something
different something fixed and hard like a gunfighters

There is no past or future in these eyes There is only

what is

INT SUBWAY STATION - DAY 178

Neo whip-draws his gun with the flashpoint speed of
lightning as--

Smith OPENS FIRE

GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground both men
BLASTING moving at impossible speed

For a blinking moment we enter BULLET-TIME

Gun flash tongues curl from Neos gun bullets float
forward like a plane moving across the sky cartridges
cartwheel into space

An instant later they are nearly on top of each other
rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
reflection of the other --

Each jamming their gun tight to the others head

They freeze in a kind of embrace Neo sweating panting
Agent Smith machine-calm Agent Smith smiles

AGENT SMITH
Youre empty

Neo pulls the TRIGGER CLICK

NEO
So are you

The smile falls Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER
CLICK

Agent Smiths face warps with rage and he attacks fists
flying at furious speed blows and counters Neo
retreating as --

A knife-hand opens his forearm and a kick sends him
slamming back against a steel column Stunned he ducks
just under a punch that CRUNCHES into the BEAM STEEL
CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel

Behind him Neo leaps into the air delivering a neck-
snapping reverse round-house Agent Smiths glasses fly
off and he glares at Neo his eyes ice blue

AGENT SMITH
Im going to enjoy watching you
die Mr Anderson
Agent Smith attacks with unrelenting fury fists pounding
Neo like jackhammers

INT HOVERCRAFT 179

Trinity watches Neo as his body jerks mouth coughing
blood his life signs going wild

TRINITY
Jesus hes killing him

INT SUBWAY STATION - DAY 180
Agent Smith grabs hold of him lifting him into the air
hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel
where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail
The Agent is about to jump down and press his attack when
he hears something From deep in the tunnel like an
animal cry a BURST of HIGH-SPEED METAL GRINDING against
METAL
The sound of an ONCOMING TRAIN

( )
180

Neo tries to get up Agent Smith jumps down onto the
tracks and drop-kicks him in the face The world again
begins to shake RUMBLING as a TRAIN NEARS

AGENT SMITH
Do you hear that Mr Anderson

Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold forcing him to look
down the tracks the trains headlight burning a hole in
the darkness

AGENT SMITH
That is the sound of
inevitability

Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight

AGENT SMITH
It is the sound of your death

There is another METAL SCREECH much LOUDER CLOSER as
Agent Smith tightens his hold Neo is unable to breathe

AGENT SMITH
Good-bye Mr Anderson

The TRAIN ROARS at them swallowing Agents Smiths
words The veins bulge in Neos head as he grits
through the pain

He is not ready to die

NEO
My name is Neo

Impossibly he hurls himself straight up smashing Smith
against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel

They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
into the station Neo backflips up off the tracks just
as--

The train barrels over Agent Smith

Neo stands knees shaking when the TRAIN SLAMS on its
emergency brake With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
tortured RAILS the train slows part of it still in the
station

Neo turns limping starting to run racing for the
escalator--

As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
car open Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit his
glasses again intact

dealing into his cell phone when it disappears snatched
by Neo as he flashes by

of the hall the Agents wait for the elevator when Agent
Smith glances back He rips off his sunglasses looking
at Neo as if he were looking at a ghost

Neo gets to his feet all three Agents grabbing for their
guns As one they FIRE

NEO
No

Neo raises his hands and the BULLETS like a cloud of
obedient bees slow and come to a stop They hang frozen
in space fixed like stainless steel stars

The Agents are unable to absorb what they are seeing

Neo plucks one of the bullets from the air We see him
and the hall reflected in the bright casing We MOVE
CLOSER UNTIL the bullet fills our vision and the
distorted reflection morphs becoming the real image

He drops the bullet and the others fall to the floor
Neo looks out now able to see through the curtain of the

Matrix For a moment the walls the floor even the
Agents become a rushing stream of code

All three stare transfixed with awe as the scrolling code
accelerates faster and faster as if the machine

of Neo standing in the hall

Agent Smith screams his calm machine-like expression
shredding with pure rage

He rushes Neo His attack is ferocious but Neo blocks
each blow easily Then with one quick strike to the
chest he sends Agent Smith flying backwards

For the first time since their inception the Agents know
fear

Agent Smith gets up bracing himself as Neo charges him
and springs into a dive But the impact doesnt come

Neo sinks into Agent Smith disappearing his tie and coat
rippling as if he were a deep pool of water

Spinning around he looks to the others and feels
something like a tremor before a quake something deep
something that is going to change everything

Suddenly a SEARING SOUND stabs through his earpiece as
his chest begins to swell then balloon as--

Neo BURSTS up out of him And with a final death scream
Agent Smith EXPLODES like an empty husk in a brilliant
cacophony of light his shards spinning away absorbed by
the Matrix until--

Only Neo is left

the same idea striking simultaneously--

across the screen

hiding Whether Im done
fighting I suppose is up to you

We GLIDE IN TOWARDS the screen

I believe deep down we both want
this world to change I believe
that the Matrix can remain our
cage or it can become our
chrysalis thats what you helped
me to understand That to be
free you cannot change your cage
You have to change yourself

We DIVE THROUGH the numbers surging UP THROUGH the
darkness sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars

NEO (VO)
When I used to look out at this
world all I could see was its
edges its boundaries its rules
and controls its leaders and
laws But now I see another
world A different world where
all things are possible A world
of hope Of peace

We realize that the constellation is actually the holes
in the mouthpiece of a phone Seen from inside
