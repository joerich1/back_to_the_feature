yes I have I loved it when you
nuked Las Vegas A fine biblical
end for the place

But arent you going to call them
and explain what Joshuas doing

FALKEN
Listen children Once upon and time
a long time ago there lived a
magnificient race of animals who
dominated the world through age
after age

Falken gets up and goes to the projector turns it on

fought and they Flew until suddenly
quite a short time ago really they
disappeared just gave up

hiding in the rocks And when we go

give up David

makes them launch an 2 ita

be your fault

FALKEN
My fault The whole point was to
find a way to practice nuclear war
without actually destroying ourselves
Let the computers learn from mistakes

we couldnt afford to make But I

could never get Joshua to learn the
most important lesson

DAVID
Whats that

FALKEN
Futility That theres a time when
its useless to try anymore

JENNIFER
What kind of a lesson is that

FALKEN
Dont you see its like when a
child plays noughts and crosses -
tie-tac-tee At first he plays it
over and over then suddenly he
gives up You know why

JENNIFER
I dont know its boring Its
always a tie

FALKEN
Theres no way to win The
game itself is pointiess But
back at the war room they believe
you can win a nuclear war That
there can be acceptable losses

DAVID
So you gave up and decided to

play dead

FALKEN

For security reasons they
graciously arranged my death Did
you know that no land animal with
a body weight of over fifty pounds
gurvived that age Extinction is
