and curses at the birds in their cages

PASSERS BY wonder if he’s drunk or drugged Fai uses
pedestrians and lamp posts to keep his’ feet Finally he
settles down hard on the dirty damp curb

The sun has become relentlessly bright-- he shields his eyes
against it with a trembling hand Muttering

Fai looks back over his shoulder-- what he sees scares him
into rising He moves away from the onslaught of a seizing
brain and takes three blind steps backward into the street

A TRUCK wipes Fai off the face of the earth with a sudden
mechanical ease He is pulled half-way down the block in the
Suspension before the driver knows what happened

People gather round as blood pools out from his body Crowds
fill the street Dogs come to check out the carnage

checked the latest from the CDC--
the only things were Measles and
HIN1 It wasn’t that

EMHOFF
Then what was it

CONTAGION 11410 14

ER DOC
She was very sick We tried
everything we could-- she just
didn‘t respond

EMHOFFP
From what

ER DOC
We don’t always know Some people
get a disease and live - Some
become sicker and die My best
guess is that it was either
meningitis or encephalitis and with
encephalitis we’re in the dark 90
per cent of the time- if itwas
summer I might say a bug bite
West Nile Herpes can cause
encephalitis We can tell you how
but not always why Her blood work
indicated some sort of massive
infection-- thats how

EMHOFF
I don’t understand She didn’t
have herpes

ER DOC
If you want we can order an
autopsy-- but I can’t guarantee
it’ll be conclusive There are
also grief counselors who are very
helpful with this sort of passing
I find that is where most people
get some resolution

ACROSS THE FOYER
BUSINESS SUIT sits with Clark watching the game

BUSINESS SUIT

Using our models we believe there
are approximately 89000 cases at

naught of 32 here is where we

We are not prepared to connect the
Macau casino cases with the ones in
Kowloon at this point-- I think we
need to wait for analysis of the

CHEEVER
But my understanding is that there
is considerable traffic between the
two

CHINESE OFFICIAL
Yes But we should wait for the
science

LEOPOLD
We have an epidemiologist on the
ground in Hong Kong-- her work in
determining the origins of the
outbreak is crucial Once we know
where this thing came from we can
get about the business of solving i
it

We are cooperating fully

Dr Cheever-- perhaps you can
update us on the research

We believe it is a paramyxovirus
We know that it is transmitted
easily by respiration and believe
it also can live on surfaces for up

nobody has been able to grow the
virus in cells

AFRICAN REPRESENTATIVE
And why is that

Excuse me Dr Leopold but I don’t
see the point in arguing about who
gets the rights to a cure that
doesn’t even exist yet

Maybe it does exist That’s why we
need disclosure

There are stories on the internet
that in India and elsewhere
ribavirin has been shown to be
effective in the treatment of the
virus- but Homeland Security has
asked the CDC not to make any”
announcements until stockpiles of
the drug can be secured

CHEEVER
There are ongoing evaluations of a
‘number of drugs-- ribavirin is one
of them So far our best defense is
social distancing

COOPER
And do we have enough ribavirin for
everyone in America

CHEEVER
Right now there are ten million
doses But we don’t want to send
people out searching for something
that may not be effective

COOPER
If there are 200 million of us--
who gets it

CHEEVER
We are currently in the process of
prioritizing-- starting with first
responders health care providers
and other officials

Krumwiede listens through an ear piece

CONTAGION 11410 85

COOPER (0S)
On Twitter this morning you stated
the truth about the virus has ‘been
kept from the world by the WHO and
cdc to allow for the “friends of
the current administration to-
benefit from it both finanetally
and physically”

KRUMWIEDE
This is the result of government
being involved in health care
There are therapies that we know
are effective right now-- like
Forsythia-- and they do not even
appear on the CDC website Because
the friends of the administration
don’t control forsythia

COOPER
You also say that the World Health
Organization is in bed with the
pharmaceutical companies

KRUMWIEDE
Because they are Thats who stands
to gain from this

CHEEVER
The CDC has explored forsythia and
other alleged homeopathic
treatments there’s just no science
to back up these claims We are
ruling nothing out-- people are
sick and dying and we are doing
everything we can to stop it

KRUMWIEDE
Dr Cheever is being a bit
disingenuous here

CHEEVER
The WHO and the Chinese are working
very hard to figure out where this
virus came from and once we know
that it will be much easier to
treat it To get sick you need to
come in contact with a sick person
oer something they touched- to get
scared all you need to do is come
in contact with a rumor or a TV or
the internet Mr Krumwiede is
spreading misinformation even
faster than the virus

KRUMWIEDE
Really Thats funny Because if
you look on Twitter there is a
communique attributed to Dr
Cheever by Elizabeth Nygaardabout
the quarantine of Chicago hours
before it was announced to the
public So that’s why I say he is
disingenuous when he talks about
equal care for all

COOPER
These are some pretty wild
allegations here- can you tell us
what information appeared on
Twitter and when What is your
relationship to Elizabeth Nygaard

Cheever is stunned

CHEEVER
I’m not aware of anything
attributed to me-

KRUMWIEDE
It’s pretty clear that Homeland

their way into the long corrugated building and roost in the
