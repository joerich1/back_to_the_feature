TITLE THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE 3
EXT OCEANUNDERWATER -- DAY 4

Blue deep and featureless the twilight of five hundred
feet down PROPELLER SOUND Materializing out of the blue
limbo is the enormous but sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN
ballistic missile submarine

INT USS MONTANA -- DAY 5

In the attack center darkened to womb-red the crews faces
shine with sweat in the glow of their instruments The
SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around BARNES the sonarman

CAPTAIN
Sixty knots No way Barnes the
reds dont have anything that fast

BARNES
Checked it twice skipper Itsa
real unique signature No
cavitation no reactor noise
doesnt even sound like screws

He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack
room listens to the intruders acoustic signature a strange
THRUMMING The captain studies the electronic position
board a graphic representation of the contours of the steep-
walled canyon a symbol for the Montana and converging with
it an amorphous trace representing the bogey

CAPTAIN
What the hell is it

EXEC
Ill tell you what its not its
not one of ours

BARNES
Sir Contact changing heading to
two-one-four diving Speed eighty
knots Eighty knots

EXEC
Eighty knots
BARNES
Still diving depth nine hundred
feet Port clearance to cliff
wall one hundred fifty feet

FRANK
(simultaneously)
Still diving depth nine hundred
feet Port clearance to cliff
wall one hundred fifty feet

Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to
intercept the intruder The exec tensely watches the vector-
graphic readout for the side- scan sonar array The sub is
running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls

EXEC
(low to Captain)
Its getting tight in here

CAPTAIN
We can still give him a haircut
Helm come right to oh six niner
down five degrees

HELMSMAN
Coming right to oh six niner sir
Down five degrees

NAVIGATOR
Port side clearance one hundred
twenty feet narrowing to seventy-
five Sir we have a proximity
warning light

EXEC
Thats too damn close Weve gotta
back off

BARNES

Range to contact two hundred
Contact junked to bearing two six
oh and accelerated to one
hundred thirty knots sir

EXEC
(really freaked now)
Nothing goes one thirty

Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness

EXT USS MONTANA 6

We see only the effect not the source as a large diffuse
light passes rapidly under the subs hull Moments later a
shockwave like an underwater sonic boom impacts the sub
slamming it sideways

INT USS MONTANA 7

The bride crew are knocked off their feet as the ship is
buffeted

EXEC
Turbulence Were in its wake
SIRENS Everyone shouting at once The power flickers low
CAPTAIN

Helm all stop Full right rudder

HELMSMAN
All stop Full right rudder
Hydraulic failure Planes are not
responding sir

Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at
the side-scan display AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE
THEM

HELMSMAN (CONT’D)
Hydraulics restored sir

EXT USS MONTANA 8

The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the
port bow with nightmarish slow-motion The sub slams into
it with horrific force scraping along and bouncing off
One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw prangs
the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG

INT PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM 9
With the outer tube-doors torn off seawater slams in
busting the inner hatches Two-foot thick columns of water
like fire-hoses of the gods blast into the room

Everything vanishes instantly in white spray

INT CONTROL RMATTACK CENTER 10

Everyone is hurled off his feet The planesman flights to
recover control of the yoke
CAPTAIN
Collision alarm Collision alarm
Lighten her up Charlie

NAVIGATOR
The torpedo room is flooded sir

CAPTAIN
Blow all tanks Blow everything

HELMSMAN
Passing twelve hundred feet

EXEC
Blowing main tanks

HELMSMAN
Twelve hundred fifty feet

EXT MONTANA

The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its
flooded bow section its flanks rushing past us like a
freight train headed for Hell

INT MONTANA CONTROL ROOM

The command crew fights futility for control everyone
shouting and terrified

EXEC
Main forward tanks ruptured

HELMSMAN
Passing thirteen hundred feet

EXEC
Too deep to pump auxiliaries

CAPTAIN
All back full All back full

HELMSMAN
Answering all back full Passing
thirteen hundred fifty feet
fourteen hundred fourteen
fifty

The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din

CAPTAIN
Were losing her Launch the buoy

The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button
A red light comes on The Captains takes a deep breath

EXT MONTANA 13

A tiny transmitter is ejected from the subs hell and begins
its long ascent to the surface A second later the sub
slams down like a piledriver onto a ledge tearing open its
pressure hull

INT MONTANA 14
VARIOUS QUICK CUTS just flashes and impressions as
Seawater blasts down the corridors -- Explodes across the
control room hurling men like dolls -- Floods the cavernous
missile bay in seconds -- Bursts through hatches into the
reactor room -- Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second
EXT OCEANUNDERWATER 15

In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea
cliff its hull SCREECHING like the death agonies of some
marine dinosaur Descending in an avalanche of silt it
finally disappears into the blackness below a blackness
which continues almost straight down 20000 feet to the
bottom of the Cayman Trough The abyss

EXT OCEAN SURFACE -- DAY 16

Above in the world the Caribbean rolling gray under a
stormy sky The Montanas emergency buoy pops to the
surface transmitting

CUT TO
EXT OCEAN20 MILES AWAY -- DAY 17

LONG LENS SHOT three massive Navy Sea King helicopters
thundering straight at us FILLING FRAME

REVERSE as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian
ship an ugly but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling
support ship the BENTHIC EXPLORER It is a twin-hulled
monstrosity with a central opening in its deck around which
crouch enormous cranes winches and other arcane equipment

The first Sea King settles onto the helipad disgorging a
contingent of Naval officers technicians and a squad of
armed seamen A pantomime in the rotorwash we see the
Benthic Petroleum company man KIRKHILL greeting COMMODORE
DEMARCO the on-scene commander

INT BENTHIC EXPLORERBRIDGE -- DAY 18

The bridge is state-of-the-art with computers and
sophisticated navigation and communications gear looking
like mission control with its bank of video monitors The
Drilling Operations Supervisor LELAND MCBRIDE and BENDIX
the crew chief watch the invaders swarming the deck below

MCBRIDE
Does not look good at all

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working
in total blackness around some sort of installation on the
bottom of the ocean They move through the harsh
floodlights in dreamlike slow motion looking like space-
suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses

DEMARCO (VO)
No light from the surface How
deep are they

MCBRIDE (VO)
Seventeen hundred feet

WIDER showing the Navy contingent crowding the control
room DeMarco is hardcore military brusque and efficient
Kirkhill is a small man with pinched features wearing a
shirt and tie which on a drill ship means company man
andor dickhead

DEMARCO
I need them to go to over two
thousand

KIRKHILL

They can do it

framework connects two tri- modules consisting of three
cylinders each These contain living and work areas ina
pressurized environment An umbilical cable thick as a
mans thigh runs up from the oil rig into the darkness to
the Benthic Explorer at the surface In a bubble-like dome
port window we see the rig foreman or toolpusher BUD

Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor The
working heart of the rig THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR The
drill crew in hardhats and mud- plastered overalls tend

chamber The semi-automated system requires only five men
to operate The others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER DWIGHT PERRY
JAMMER WILLIS and TOMMY RAY DIETZ Bud hears his names
called above the din by Jammer a massive roughneckdiver
who stands a good head taller than the rest

INT CORRIDORCONTROL MODULE 25

The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of
a Winnebago packed with instrumentation At the end isa
small bay with multiple viewports Outside at a Christmas
tree pipe installation a lone diver can be seen welding
He is accompanied by a large submersible FLATBED and by a
Remotely Operated Vehicle or ROV call LITTLE GEEK Little
Geek is an underwater robot which operated on the end of a
cable-like control TETHER It has a single video eye in
front by which the operator pilots the little machine The
rigs ROV pilots is ALLEN HIPPY CARNES who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee His pet
white rat BEANY crawls contentedly around his shoulders
The door BANGS OPEN

Hippy jumps slops his coffee Bud strides in Not calm

BUD
Son of a bitch

He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a
switch marked DIVER RECALL A SIREN blasting through the
water from a big hydrophone loudspeaker

male environment by being one of the best submersible
drivers in the business She controls a hydraulic
manipulator arm assisting the diver ARLISS SONNY DAWSON
in his work Little Geek hovers around them like a tiny
helicopter One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and
hands him the pipe

Here you go hon

SONNY
Just in time sugar

They react to Buds recall looking toward him up in the

ONE NIGHT

Dammit we just got out here
SONNY

There was a time when I would have

asked why

One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator
claw which he narrowly avoids

CUT TO
EXT DEEPCOREUNDER SUB-BAY 27

Flatbed moves underneath the rig a few feet above the
seafloor with Sonny riding on its top deck It passes
under a lit opening and rises toward the surface of the
water in the chamber above Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog

INT SUB-BAYMOONPOOL 28

The opening is called the moonpool and Deepcores
submersibles are launched through it From inside the sub-
bay it looks just like a swimming pool Flatbed surfaces
nearly filling it The chamber also contains CAB ONE a
similar submersible Jammer Perry and some of the other
drill-room boys are helping the divers out of the water
The water at this depth is only about six degrees above
freezing and these folks are cold and prune- fingered
Finler pulls off his demand-helmet revealing a round
boyish face

FINLER
Whats goin on How come we got
recalled

SONNY
Hell is I know

One Night jumps ashore from Flatbeds broad deck and joins
them Catfish is unzipping his bulky dry-suit

CATFISH
Just follow standard procedure
will ya flog the dog till
somebody tells us whats happening

At 0922 local time this morning
an American nuclear submarine the
USS Montana with 156 men aboard
went down 22 miles from here
(MORE )

DEMARCO (CONTD)
There has been no contact with the
sub since then The cause of the
incident is not known

PAN AROUND the reactions of the various drill crew
members shocked hushed curious

DEMARCO (CONT’D)
Your company has authorized the
Navys use of this facility fora
rescue operation The code name is
Operation Salvor

ONE NIGHT
You want us to search for the sub

DEMARCO
No We know where it is But
shes in 2000 feet of water and we
cant reach her We need divers to
enter the sub and search for
survivors if any

Buds scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to
talk

BUD
Dont you guys have your own stuff
for this type of thing

DEMARCO
By the time we get our rescue
submersible here the storm front
will be right on us But you can
get your rig in under the storm and

be on- site in fifteen hours That
makes you our best option right
now

Hippy born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid
leans forward

HIPPY
Why should we risk our butts ona
job like this

KIRKHILL
I have been authorized to offer you
all special- duty bonuses
equivalent to three times normal
dive pay

CATFISH
Hell for triple time Id crawl
through razor blades and shower off
with lime juice

FINLER
Im here to tell ya you could set
me on fire and call me names

BUD
Look I dont know what kind of a
deal you guys worked out with the
company but my people are not
qualified for this theyre oil
workers

DEMARCO
A four-man SEAL team will transfer
down to you to supervise the
operation

BUD
You can send down whoever you like
but Im the toolpusher on this rig
and when it comes to the safety of
these people theres me then
theres God Understand If
things get dicey Im pulling the
plug

Meet LINDSEY Project Engineer for Deepcore Shes a pain
in the ass but youll like her Eventually Shes holding
on grimly sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear getting tossed around by the storm The SEALs are
dressed alike in black fatigues They are muscular finely-
tuned and extremely dangerous special-forces types The
leader of the SEAL team LIEUTENANT COFFEY makes his way
forward to the cockpit

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick trying to hold the
great beast of a helicopter in position Through the
windshield the deck of the Benthic Explorer can be seen
below pitching in a violent sea

PILOT
No way Im putting her down I
shouldnt even be flying in this

Just hold it over the deck

Coffey goes back to the crew deck moving easily in the
bucking craft He nods to the others SEALS MONK WILHITE
and SCHOENICK In the open side door Wilhite clips a 100
foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the coil
One by one the shoulder the gear-bags grab the rope and
step out Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door
watching the SEALs fast-roping to the deck One two

her shoes and purse in the bag and grips the bag in her
teeth Then grabs the rope and slides down

Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well sending up
geysers of spray Next to the launch-well crewman have
attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE eighteen feet of ugly
yellow submersible It slams violently in its steel cradle
as the drill-ship rolls Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear
bags in to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear
of the submersible

Lindsey approaches wearing a borrowed roustabouts
coverall

She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases
brought by the SEALs lying on the deck Stenciled on it
are the words FBSDEEP SUITMARK IV Coffey and
Schoenick push past her to pick it up

LINDSEY
Lets go gentlemen We either
launch now or we dont launch

Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of
Cab Three and grabs the lifting shackle circling her raised
hand to signal the crane man

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Take her up Byron

Cab Three with Lindsey riding its back is pulled up out
its cradle and starts to swing violently as Explorer
pitches The submersible is then swung out to the center of
the launch well It sways and gyrates above the furious
water below Lindsey drops into the upper hatch

Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside
locking levers of the hatch

LINDSEY

(to Coffey)
A little change of plan

The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable and
the SEALs jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space
are getting slammed into the walls Lindsey is calmly
flipping switches as she talks

alone for one moment in the chamber He raises his hand and
stares at it The fingertips are trembling the slightest

bumps into a large dark mass

out of the chair to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to
take over

Bud catches up with Lindsey in the corridor and through the
following keeps pace with here as she make here inspection

BUD
Then whyd you come down

She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe He almost slams
into her She moves on climbing down the ladder to the
lower level

LINDSEY
You need me Nobody knows the
systems on this rig better than I
do What is something was to go
wrong after the Explorer clears
off What would have you done

BUD
Wow youre right Us poor dumb
ol boys mightve had to think for
ourselves Coulda been a disaster

On the lower level landing Lindsey opens a hatch into one
of the machine rooms ROAR OF PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS

INT MACHINE ROOM 58
Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth

of pipes and roaring machinery Her eyes rove constantly
over fittings gauges circuit panels

BUD
(yelling)
You wanna know what I think

LINDSEY
Not particularly Jeez look where
this is set Morons

She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely

Lindseys

BUD
I think you were worried about me

LINDSEY
That must be it

on the move again and Bud scrambles through the

pipes to keep up

BUD
No I think you were Come on
admit it

LINDSEY

I was worried about the rig Ive
got over four years invested in

BUD
My bunks the only one I can
guarantee wont be occupied You
can grab a couple hours before we

Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room the only
private bunk on the rig Rank had its privileges His hand
on the door is just level with her eyes She notices his
wedding ring a massive band of pure titanium (something
your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from

MIT)
LINDSEY
What are you still wearing that
for
BUD

I dont know Divorce aint final
Forgot to take it off

Bud stays in the doorway Lindsey takes a heaps of Buds
cloths off the narrow bunk Start unconsciously
straightening the room

LINDSEY
I havent worn mine in months

BUD
Yeah whats-his-name wouldnt like
it The Suit

LINDSEY
Do you always have to call him
that The Suit It makes you sound
like such a hick His name is
Michael

Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks

Bud eyes her sounding too causal

BUD
So what about Michael then Mr
Brooks Brothers Mr BMW You

LINDSEY
No I havent seen him in a few
weeks

BUD

What happened

LINDSEY
Bud why are you doing this Its

woke up one day and realized the
guy never made you laugh

LINDSEY
Youre right Bud It was just
that simple Arent you clever
You should get your own show Ask
Dr Bud advice to the lovelorn
from three hundred fathoms

She closes the watertight door forcing him out Locks it
She turns and throws her shoe hard against the far wall

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
AAAARRRGGH

She flops down on the bed sitting staring at the wall
Her armor is gone She looks small and vulnerable A long
beat She reaches over to the tiny sink Amid the clutter
is a bottle of Buds aftershave She unscrews it and takes
a sniff Catches herself Tosses it

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Shit

Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring
finger He pulls the ring off roughly and throws it into
the toilet He reaches forward to flush Cant do it Now

Shut up and get your gear on

NEARBY Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the
worktable Hippy points to the heavy equipment case that
says FBS DEEP SUITMARK IV

HIPPY
Ive been meaning to ask you what
this thing is

Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving
suit what looks like a space helmet and a large backpack

MONK

got them We use it if we need to
go really deep

HIPPY
How deep

MONK
Deep
(shrugs )
Its classified you know
Anyway you breathe liquid so you
cant be compressed Pressure
doesnt get to you

Catfish is grappling with the concept

CATFISH
Youre saying you get liquid in
your lungs

MONK
Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion

Monk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf
and dumps them out He opens a valve on the backpack and
allows some of the fluid inside it to drain into the box
Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippys shoulder

HIPPY
Hey

MONK
Check this out

He drops Beany in the box and before Hippy can protest
closes the lid Beany is forced under the surface He
struggled for a second and bubbles come out of his mouth
Then he casually swims around in there completely
submerged breathing liquid Catfish and the others stare
into the box amazed

MONK (CONTD)
See Hes diggin it

Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few
seconds to drain his lungs Then hands him back to Hippy

sail big as a five-story building Far below her Flatbed
moves along the edge of the ledge which supports the vast
sub

Its lights and Lindseys strobes reveal the tremendous
damage to the forward section as they pass the sail The
torn and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down

Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is
almost torn away from the rest of the hull

with its rows of bunks The room is twisted and disheveled
with bedding hanging from the bunks like the lolling tongues

Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey Together they

wrench the door open on its squealing hinges It give way
suddenly flying open The suction pulls SOMETHING THROUGH
It slams Buds shoulder He turns A FACE RIGHT IN

FRONT OF HIM He jerks back gasping

Face to face with Barnes the sonarman The ensign seems
unmarked merely dismayed at his own mortality judging from
his wide eyes and mouth Coffey reaches past Bud and pushes
the ensigns body out of the way

COFFEY (CONT’D)
Alright lets keep moving We
knew we were going to see this

They enter the control room Their lights play over the
high-tech wreckage Floating debris and bodies make shifting
shadows on the walls as they swirl in the currents A
languid weightless waltz They move through the carnage
Their lights pick out tableaux the planesman still
strapped in his chair someone jammed into the ceiling
pipes hanging down Dead faces pale in the lights

Still We see only glimpses

Coffey locates the captains body and rolls it over

Removes the missile arming key which hangs on a chain around
the dead mans neck Moves on All business Bud turns
back to his guys Checking them He notices Jammer is
breathing so rapidly hes fogging his helmet Catfish
Finler and Sonny arent much better A wave a panic seems
imminent

binders the code books He also grabs handfuls of
classified documents and orders and a set of missile arming
keys all which he places in a pouch at his waist

INT CORRIDOR 80

Bud leads Jammer through a long claustrophobically narrow
corridor tapping on the walls and hatches periodically

After he taps he waits a few moments There are no
answering taps They open doors and shine their lights into
the rooms The are bodies but they seem anonymous

Crumpled shapes in khaki or blue They undog and open a
hatch Beyond it is the largest chamber of the sub the

The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and
twenty feet long and forty feet high with two rows of
vertical launch tubes 24 in all The chamber is divided
into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork

Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the mans face One
scuttles out of his gaping mouth

the far end of the missile compartment He goes down a
stairwell to the lower level A HUNDRED FEET AWAY Jammer
loses sight of Buds dive-lights He starts to get nervous
Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM flickering lower and
lower They become little orange candles the filament
barely glowing The darkness closes in

JAMMER
Bud BUD You readin me
BUD

BUD at the same moment is fiddling with the connector
cables on his helmet lights which are dimming and
flickering He hears nothing from his helmet transceiver

JAMMER smacks the side of his helmet Shakes the
transceiver on his belt Nothing just static Then even
the static dies Panic time

He grabs the safety line and pulls twice Hard It is
snagged on a sharp metal edge ten feet from him He pulls
twice more harder hauling the thing The line severs
Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward him His
eyes bug He looks all around in the darkness Cant see
Bud Cant decide what to do We can see hysteria revving
up inside him like a flywheel

Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over
the walls It is a cold and ethereal light unlike the warm-
white of their dive lights

It grows brighter He turns slowly toward it

The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck
sending shafts of cold light flickering upward hypnotically
coming toward him

JAMMER (CONT’D)
Bud Is that you

CU JAMMER shielding his eyes staring into the radiant
source

Guess what Jammer Its not Bud In the brightest center
of the glow SOMETHING is moving a figure casting strange
inhuman shadow across the walls Jammer blinks against the
glare his face registering total outright astonishment
melting into terror

The glare pulses subtly hypnotically The shifting shadow
falls across Jammer He finally snaps out of his fixity

Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing
hand over hand through the treacherous wreckage

His harness catches on a twisted pipe

He struggles totally out of control the big man reduced
to a blind panic

Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength

He tears free of the entangling debris Launches like a
torpedo slamming his backpack full force into the top
sill of the hatchway His tri-mix regulator takes the full
brunt of the impact

ON BUD swimming furiously back toward Jammers position
The strange radiance is gone His dive light flare back to
full brightness

BUD

He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in
place A seizure Bud grapples with him

Catfish Sonny and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment
later They leap into the fray

BUD (CONT’D)

They drag Jammers slack form into the corridor hauling
their way rapidly back along the lifeline

INTEXT CAB ONE and MONTANA SAIL 84

Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail maneuvering
to clear the horizontal diving plane Then her lights go
dim and her thrusters loose power

Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail
and SOMETHING appears right in front of her a glowing
object moving like a bat out of hell right at her It is
slightly smaller than submersible and we only get a glimpse
What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent
ovoid open at the front with a spinning vortex of light
inside like some hallucinatory jet engine And its
hauling ass

Lindsey jinks left The object jogs right She fights the
control as her sub slews around slamming broadside into the
sail K-BAM Her power comes back up Righting Can One
she spins to look through the aft viewport in time to see
the object racing away in a broad arc It pulls a high-G
turn and dives straight down

We see the object zip behind Flatbed One Night cant see
it

The thing spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run
drunk diving along the wall into the abyss until it is lost
to view

shaking Suddenly Buds voice blares out over the open

INT MAINTENANCE ROOM B -- LATER 142

Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead They
have a small port removed and are attaching waterproof leads
from an ELECTRONIC DETONATOR The black box Lindsey
glimpsed earlier As the two SEALS work like surgeons we
see past Coffeys shoulder to a hemispherical window behind
him which looks out into the perpetual blackness

Something appears a goofy shark face

Big Geek rises silently in front of the port It moves a
little trying to get a peek over Coffeys shoulder

brakes on her

LINDSEY
Look goddamnit if you wont do

BUD
Lindsey Wait a second--

She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room B Its
locked Before Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-
extinguisher off the wall and pounds on the steel door like
a big gong BOOM BOOM BOOM

Needless to say it opens She pushes past Schoenick see
the bomb lying there naked

LINDSEY

Coffey warning him with a look that is not to be messed

stance with one arm behind his back Suddenly theres a

ANGLE FROM BEHIND COFFEY as Buds group moves out of sight
up the corridor Hands behind his back In his hand
cocked finger on the trigger is the 45 He turns and
sets it on the table steadying himself as if in the wind
he seems to sag When he looks at Schoenick his eyes are
wounds A hunted animal Voice shaky

twisted reflection into the void Eternal night

the acrylic bubble beside him is one of those Garfields
suction cups on its paws Coffey stares out Behind his

INT QUARTERSMESS HALL 150

The lights are down Those who can are grabbing some sleep
Snoring comes from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes
In the mess hall Catfish and Bud are crashed out on the
tables wrapped in blankets The cold has gotten intense
Water drips The walls sweat with condensation Lindsey
can see her breath as she makes coffee She carries a cup
over to Monk who is a face in a pile of blankets A hand
comes out takes the coffee

MONK
Thanks

Lindsey sips hers staring Her thoughts are far away in
the bottomless pit She is leaning up against the table
where Bud is sleeping His soft snoring downshifts into a
loud rasp Lindsey touches him gently on the shoulder

LINDSEY
Virgil turn on your side

Bud grunts and turns without waking an automatic response
The snoring stops It is a quiet intimate moment a
reminder of the mileage these two have logged together

CUT TO
INT SONAR SHACK 151

Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens
Too comfortable Hes asleep chin on his chest

On the main passive-sonar screen an almost imperceptibly
faint trace appears A HUM which is by now familiar
becomes audible Sonny shifts in his seat Doesnt wake

INT SUB BAY 152

Hippy puts his tools away finished with the modifications
to Big Geek

HIPPY
All set big guy Hey I told you
to wipe that grin off your face

He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor
door Switches off the lights Goes out

Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool A beat Then

A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool
opening sending shadows shifting across the top of the
chamber The surface begins to pulsate

Suddenly the water itself rises forming itself into a
shifting shimmering pseudopod as big around as a mans
body The transparent form pulses an amoebic mass
shivering in the air

It stretches becoming a more refined form Like a blindly
probing glass python it elongates and weaves across the
room It extends and extends stretching out from the
moonpool a shimmering tentacle The head or tip a
featureless liquid bulb seems somehow to be scanning as it
moves forward as if it can see where its going

INT CORRIDOR 153

Hippy trudges along the dark corridor He reaches the mens
head and goes in As the door closes the tip of the liquid
pseudopod extends into the corridor BG It looks left
and right Then extends the length of the corridor holding
itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake

INT TRIMODULE BLADDERWELLBUNKROOMMESS HALL 154

LOOKING DOWN three levels through the central ladderwell
between the cylinders The pseudopod enters and undulates
upward

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM we see its tip extend
inside

Sonny and One Night are snoring oblivious Jammer is still
unconscious The pseudopod taking its time checks them
out and then moves on

IN THE MESS HALL its dark and quiet Lindsey has even
fallen asleep in her chair her head buried in her arms on
the table The shimmering tentacle enters the room in total
silence It sways gracefully in to air searching It
undulates across the room hanging about five feet in the
air surveying everything It moves past Lindsey Sensing
something she lifts her head turning sees the
apparition next to her

Her eyes go wide Amazement but not fear The tentacle is
moving on still searching Lindsey shakes Bud awake
clapping her hand over his mouth

Bud blinks twice then freezes When she lowers her hand
his mouth is hanging open like a total goon

Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish on the next table

Catfish cracks one eye open Turns away Turns right
back both eyes open now Sensing movement the thing
turn back toward them It seems to recognize Lindsey It
doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her
She holds her ground fascinated

The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face her
face It is water still clear and undulating but
definitely Lindsey She gasps in surprise The liquid-
Lindsey gasps soundlessly a perfect mimic of her
expression Lindsey laughs involuntarily It laughs
without sound Lindsey makes a face sticking out her
tongue testing it

The liquid-Lindsey does the same Bud has just had the rug
jerked out from under his sense of what is possible and what
isnt but hes taking it pretty will considering

BUD
(whispering)
I think it likes you

LINDSEY
Its trying to communicate

Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of
Buds

She reaches out her hand slowly Gingerly her fingers
touch the surface Ripples extend outward from the contact
across Buds features

Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface just
like shes dipping her hand into a bowl of water except
sideways She draws her wet fingers out and studies them
amazed Touches one fingertip to her tongue

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Seawater

The pseudopod pulls back from her It loops in the air
dramatically full circle and ties itself into a knot

As the knot tightens down it melts back into the body The
‘disappearing knot trick

Lindsey laughs grinning with the open wonder and delight of
a child at a magic show She is transported

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Show off

She looks at Bud He grins broadly Hes with her now

The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the
room Out to the corridor

INT SUB-BAY 155

Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way through the dive-
prep area They see the pseudopod arching from the moonpool
big as a treetrunk Coffeys mind is blown We can smell
the insulation burning He just stares

INT CORRIDORMAINTENANCE ROOM B 156

The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired
warhead It studies the device for a few seconds Bud and
Lindsey enter through a side door in time to see the
tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead They begin to lift it off its cart

INT SUB BAY 157

Coffey finally jump-starts his brain In a flash of
insight he runs to the big sliding door through which the
pseudopod stretches into the corridor He and Schoenick
heave on the door Like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it

VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS MESS HALL LADDERWELL
MAINTENANCE as the body of the pseudopod collapses
splashing on the floor It reverts to nothing more than a

long puddle of simple seawater As the tendrils dissolve
the warhead slams back down onto the cart unharmed ON
COFFEYS SIDE ON THE DOOR however the stump rears back
like a cobra It withdraws rapidly into the moonpool The
glow fades away

INT SONAR SHACK 158

Sonny wakes up with a start as the HUM revs up into a LOUD
WHINE and then fades away He scrambles to track it Too
late

INT CORRIDOR 159

Hippy emerges from the can and looks down puzzled at the
puddle running the length of the corridor He missed the
whole thing

INT MESS HALL 160

Light on Everybody there Lindsey is really strutting
high on life now that shes been proven right

LINDSEY
Okay raise your hand if you think
that was a Russian water-tentacle
Lieutenant No Well a
breakthrough

Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson
in The Shining Bud give her a warning look Dont poke
at the rattler

BUD
You done impressing yourself ace

ONE NIGHT
No way that could just be seawater

LINDSEY
They mustve learned how to control
water I mean at a molecular
level They can plasticize it
polymerize it whatever Put it
under intelligent control

BUD
Maybe their whole technology is
based on that Controlling water

Coffey is hunched over elbows on his knees His hands are
out of sight His arm is moving in a slow rhythm We cant
see what hes doing

HIPPY
That thing was probably their
version of Big Geek like an ROV

CATFISH
Just checking is out huh How
come

ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE showing what Coffey is doing He has
his K-BAR KNIFE gripped white-knuckle in one hand He is
drawing it slowly and repeatedly across the skin of the
other forearm Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to elbow

CU COFFEY -- He doesnt flinch His eyes are hard and
bright as diamond drills No one notices Hes keeping the
edge

LINDSEY
Theyre curious maybe We could
be the first people theyve seen up
close

SONNY
Hope they dont judge the whole
race offa us

CATFISH
Maybe I oughta shave

Coffey stands abruptly snags Schoenick with his eyes and
leaves walking through the group as if they were smoke
This cold behavior brings the mood down a notch

INT CORRIDORMAINTENANCE ROOM B 161

Outside the mess hall Coffey pauses listening to the
conversation resume Bright speculation a few jokes
Coffey is visible shaking Breathing hard Pupils dilated
Schoenick looks at him with concern

COFFEY
It went straight for the warhead
And they think its cute

SCHOENICK
You need to get some sleep

Coffey walks away without hearing him Schoenick catches
up

INT MAINTENANCE 162

The door opens in the dark room Coffey enters moving with
purpose He pulls his gear bag out from under the work
table Unzips it Pulls out a short-barreled CAR-15
assault rifle

COFFEY
We have no way of warning the
surface Do you know what that
means

Schoenick doesnt know He hopes Coffey knows Because
hes a fearless man whos discovering what it is to be
afraid Coffey inserts the magazine with a CLACK Snaps

INT CORRIDORSUB BAY 165

Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting
sound echoing from the sub-bay He edges forward slowly
trying to keep his feet silent on the steel floor Slides
up along the wall next to the door Inches his eye around
the doorframe Across the room Schoenick is working with a
chainfall lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead which is
still on its cart He begins to attach them together with a
sling of tie-down straps

Hippy lets his breath out slowly His expression is Holy
Shit

He slides back along the corridor wall silently Away from
the door Then turn turns quickly to go WHAM Coffey
slams him up against the wall 45 pressed to Hippys
temple Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the hammer

COFFEY
Sniff something did you rat boy

INT MESS HALL 166

The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy
is thrusted inside His hands are taped behind his back and
he stumbles onto his face Coffey steps through smoothly
straight-arming the 45 Schoenick flanks him with the
assault rifle aimed at the group

COFFEY
FREEZE Dont move Thats it
(to Monk)

Here hold this a second Were
going to phase three

He hands his gun to Monk with the assumption of absolute
loyalty from a team member Monks eyes move between Coffey
and the pistol We cant tell what hes thinking Coffey
grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair

HIPPY
Theyre using Big Geek to take the
bomb to the NTIs We set it up to
go right to them

Lindsey looks stricken Her plan is betraying them all

LINDSEY
Oh my God Oh no
(steps toward Coffey)
Please you cant Coffey think
about what youre doing for
Gods sake--

Coffey lets her approach him his eyes glittering
Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her
against the Coke machine pinning her there with one hand

Bud leaps forward

SCHOENICK
GET BACK

Bud freezes The rifles muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot

Coffey moves up close to Lindsey

COFFEY
This is something Ive wanted to do
since I first met you

His hand reaches down OUT OF FRAME We hear something RIP
His hand comes back up holding a piece of gaffers tape

He slaps it over her mouth Then pushes her down into a
chair

Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick

HIPPY
You boss is having a full-on
meltdown Guys fixing to pull the
pin on fifty kilotons and were all
ringside

crush this rig like a semi driving
over a beer can

Shut up SHUT UP Whats the
matter with you

knuckling his assault rifle looking from Monk to Coffey
to the group

under control
Coffey backs out quickly with Schoenick
INT CORRIDOR 167

Coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of
steel pipe into the mechanism so it cant be opened

COFFEY
Stay here

Schoenick take a position in front of the door Coffey
turns and runs through the corridor like demons are chasing
him

INT MESS HALL 168

Their only hope is to sway Schoenick But the SEALs fear
is making him the perfect machine totally dependent on
external orders And his orders are clear They can see
him through the tiny window in the door Lindsey rips the
tape painfully off her mouth

LINDSEY
Schoenick your Lieutenant is
about to make a real bad career

over the tiny window

a heap against the far wall moaning Jammer hands the
rifle to Hippy as he walks in Hippy turns to cover the
other SEAL Monk puts his hands up passively

MONK

Bud appraises Jammer who seems a little weak and dazed but
basically okay

to the sub-bay corridor Buds mind is racing He drops
down the ladder to Level One into about two feet of water
He reaches down and open the emergency lockout hatch Takes
off his boots

He drops into the water

fist becoming instantly paralyzing He starts kicking in
powerful strokes through the dark water maneuvering around
tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel Catfish is
behind him swimming like hell They reach hatch six
Together they spin the wheel and heave upward opening it

airspace with him They try the upper hatch Jammed
Theyre both panting with the exertion and intense cold

BUD

Bud looks at Catfish shivering and heaving wide-eyed

BUD
Okay Cat You head back

Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out
through the hatch

EXT DEEPCORE 174
Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and

conduit He sees the lit rectangle of the moonpool far
ahead

INT SUB BAY 175

In the moonpool Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside
the full of Flatbed His wracked breathing is masked by the
WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey uses the external controls to
extend Flatbeds big hydraulic arm locking the GeekMIRV in
its gripper

Bud strokes to a point where Coffey cant see him and heaves
up out of the water onto the deck of the pool He lies
gasping behind Cab Ones cradle His limbs are wooden and
unresponsive from the cold His fingers are completely
numb He hugs himself putting his hands under his armpits
Scans the situation He cant get to the door which is
across the room without Coffey seeing him

Lindsey watching the whole thing going down ON THE SCREEN
a high angle of the sub bay Bud moving up on Coffey

He cant get to the door I think
hes going to try and take him
himself

of a fight is arm-wrestling One

Moves forward crouched stalking Lindsey yells at the
screen in frustration

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
BUUUUUD

INT SUB BAY 177
Bud chucks a tool across the chamber creating a clattering
distraction then wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing
to the back of Coffeys knees taking him down Coffey
spins even as he falls catching Bud in a scissor kick that
topples him

Grappling they fall together into the freezing water

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold giving Bud time
to haul himself out hoping to make it to the door

Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs

He pulls himself up as Bud kick out Claws his way
viciously over Buds body until he has him pinned to the
deck Then he pulls out the 45

Put it unceremoniously to Buds forehead

Coffey pulls the trigger CLICK Bud flinches then opens

his eyes staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the 45
Coffey cocks it and tries again CLICK Nothing Really
pissed off beyond description Bud hurls the commando off
him with a powerful heave sending him clattering against a
rack of equipment They face off panting

The rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monks
voice

MONK
I tool the liberty of removing this
before I gave it back to him

Monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up
the magazine from the 45

INT SUB WAY 181
Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked Coffeys really
trying to put him out of business Its mostly duck and
dodges on Buds part Throw a few things When Coffey
connects Bud goes down hard Give him credit though He
manages to scramble back up

The fight wrecks the room scattering tools and gear
Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor
Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks
Slams the SEALs head in an equipment locker door

But the Navy man is just too massive Bud is hammered back
into a wall Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de

grace Spins around at the sound of a VOICE

CATFISH
Hey

Catfish is right behind him Dripping wet A trail of
water goes back to the moonpool a few feet away

CRACK Catfishs Hammer punch comes in so hard and so
fast Coffey is knocked right on his ass He doesnt get
up Just sort of flops around

Catfish helps Bud to his feet They advance on Coffey who
crab-scuttles sideways his eyes rabid

He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them As they
duck he sprints to Flatbed and drops through the hatch and
slams it down

BUD
(to Catfish)
Get the door

Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed The hatch is
already sealed He grapples with GeekMIRV trying to free
it from the steel claw

INT FLATBED 182

Coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilots
compartment He claws his way into the control seat and
starts rapidly flipping switches

INT CORRIDOR 183

Catfish pounds down the corridor like hes never run before
his beer gut doing a rumba He reaches the door tears out
the piece of pipe and spins the wheel Hippy pushes it open
so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach Hippy tears past
him running with the assault rifle John Wayne

INT SUB-BAY 184

Flatbed is submerging with only the hatch tower still above
the water Bud is being dragged down still trying to free
the ROV He gives up when he sees Hippy run in waving the
assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo

Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the
moonpool

Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey
visible inside his viewing bubble beneath the swirling
water Coffey looks up stares at the gun doesnt seem
to care

Safetys on On the side the

Hippy fumble with the selective-fire lever BLAM-BLAM-BLAM
He put three quick rounds into the ceiling

HIPPY
SHIT

CATFISH
Give me that

He grabs it out of Hippys hands and aims it at the sub He
racks the water with a long burst BENEATH THE SURFACE the
rounds nip nasty contrails through the water They barely
scar the front port

LINDSEY
Forget that go for Big Geek

Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts trying to
hit the shimmering shape of the ROV on its back UNDERWATER
we see the rounds arcing wild a few hitting the ROV but
causing little damage

Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor
ABOVE Catfish empties the weapon

Gimme a hand

They all turn Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a
madman The others rush over to help him

Catfish slams a backpack onto Buds shoulders grappling
with the straps and hose connections Hippy and Sonny (with
one hand) are clipping zipping and buckling all over him

two quick strides to the edge of the pool and just drops in

Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles He
looks around Through the lattice of conduit under the rig
he can see Flatbed moving forward from its exit point under
the stern Bud see a shortcut under the platform

He kicks along a lattice a pipes heaving himself along in
frantic hand-over- hand stokes He reaches for Flatbeds
stern as it passes

Misses the last hand-hold but just manages to seize a tie-
down trailing behind it He is jerked along behind the sub

Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake
of the powerful thrusters Flatbed gathers speed moving
out toward the edge of the abyssal wall The current slams
him spinning him like a fishing lure

He pulls himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern
rail of Flatbeds platform

LOW ANGLE look up the wall Flatbed appears over the edge
and stops Hovering

ON THE BACK OF FLATBED Bud has the break he needs He
scrambles up onto the deck and opens and equipment locker
Nothing in it but one of the yellow nylon safety lines The
big arm begins to unfold lifting GeekROV

INTEXT FLATBED 190

Coffey works intently His eyes are the cool ice of lethal
madness in a face streaked with blood He brings the ROV
into view with the boom arm

GEEKROV had a passenger Brigman The diver is holding
Geeks skid with one hand doing something with the other
He turns to look at Coffey

EXT FLATBEDDEEPCORE 191

Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at
Bud with the steel claw Bud dives The gripper hits his
helmet a glancing blow Bud kicks away rapidly letting
nylon rope pay out We see he has managed to tie one end to
Geeks skids Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV
sending an acoustic pulse to Geeks transponder The little
robot pregnant with its load of death turns nimbly around
and dives out and down toward the void

Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud Bud strokes
rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage He loops the rope
around a twisted pipe Big Geek is hauling ass away from
him The line snap taut an instant later The ROV strains
like a Rottweiler on a leash trying to go The rope is
slipping as Bud fights to make a knot

Flatbed slews around thrusters whining As it banks it
hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face

Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the
controls

The big arm extends menacingly The smaller from
manipulators open An enormous predatory instinct its
lights blaring

The big machine roars forward Straight at Bud

Bud gets his knot partly done See Flatbed looming

Glare-lit in its lights Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls
himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet

One manipulator slams into his backpack tumbling him and
the subs underside rakes across his legs as it passes over
Flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework K-CRUUUNCH

INT FLATBED 192

Coffey is slammed hard over the controls up into the front
dome port He gets back in the seat Strains to free his
machine

EXT DEEPCOREBIG GEEKFLATBED 193

Bud swims clear diving down at an angle along the wall
hoping to stay in Coffeys blind area Flatbed backs out of
the wreckage in a cloud of debris It pivots toward Bud
Moves after him

Nearby the ROV is whining mindlessly trying to please
Trying to GO DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage as Buds
knot begins to slip The nylon line starts to play through
the knot slowly

BUD has gotten himself into a bad position Along the bare
rock face of the cliff wall he is naked nailed in the
spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck Coffey puts
the hammer down thrust levers all the way forward Flatbed
surges forward multi-limbed and demonic Theres no cover
side to side up or down

Coffey has him head in his lights Suddenly a bright glare
blasts in blinding Coffey He looks up to see Cab One
rushing down upon him full throttle

At the last moment Lindsey slams the thrusters full-lock and
the submersible slews sideways slamming its heavy skidplate
into Flatbeds cab Coffey is smashed sideways by the
shock He fights to control his vehicle Lindsey looks up
to see Coffeys sub gun it up over the wall out of sight
She cruises up over Bud

LINDSEY (VO)
Get in

Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab
Ones belly

INTEXT CAB ONE 194

Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut He
ditches his helmet

Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall Through
the front port there is not sign of Coffey

LINDSEY
You owe me one Virgil

BUD
Can we negotiate later Theres
Big Geek

He points Through the front port they can see the ROV
still straining at its leash Lindsey dives toward it
simultaneously working the controls to open her own small
manipulator claws

EXT DEEPCOREWALL ETC 195
The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot

Big Geek happily surges forward It dives gracefully down
into the void trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail

ONE CAB ONE Bud and Lindsey through the front port

BUD
Go after it We gotta catch it

FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM dwarfing little Cab
One They are slammed viciously as Coffeys submersible
hammers into them She hits full throttle Coffey floors
it after Lindsey ramming her from behind with his more
powerful vehicle With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim

She arcs back toward the rig Flatbed slams her again for
the side She fights for control

INTEXT CAB ONE 196
Bud is tossed around ricocheting off the walls Lindsey
flies with her jaw set Fighting hard for control The A-
frame of the rig looms before her She shoots through at
full throttle

EXT DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN 197
Now the fight is really on The two subs are dodging
between the cylindrical modules at full throttle slamming

into each other and the steel pressure hulls

Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub jamming it sideways It
screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules

They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed roars along
behind her tearing up the bottom with its powerful
backwash Lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle
finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal
canyon Coffey is ramming hammering from behind then from
side to side

Lindsey snarls Hes pissing her off He shouldnt do
that

Ahead out of the blackness another outcropping
Lindsey rises cuts right

Smashes down into Coffeys craft Timing it just right He
skids catch in the rocks

Flatbed slews violently nosing down Crushing into the
rocky bottom Pressing the advantage Lindsey hammers into
Flatbed from behind

It smashes full force into a second spire spinning out of
control

Tangles together the subs slide down an embankment toward
the edge of the wall With her one remaining thruster she
jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds her crippled sub
Flatbed tumbles over the edge

ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls trailing a cloud of
sediment like a comets tail down into the unfathomable
blackness below

INT FLATBED 198
Inside the machine Coffey is fighting for control

He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad
plunge As the pressure intensifies the hull begins to
groan and steel fitting scream with the enormous load

A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front
bubble Grows Coffey gives up fighting Just stares wide
eyed at his death A damned soul dropping into the
bottomless pit

The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port

Suddenly a scythe-like curtain of seawater under tons of
pressure slashes into him A moment later the bubble
implodes and Coffey disappears in a bloody froth of
churning water air and glass shards

EXT CANYON WALL 199
Flatbed looks like a toy tumbling away down the wall

Soon its lights vanish

INT CAB ONE 200
Theyre both going to have a lot of bruises

Lindsey is surveying the damage Water is spraying down on
them like a shower and lights are flickering

LINDSEY
You did okay back there I was
fairly impressed

BUD
Not good enough We still gotta
catch Big Geek

LINDSEY
Not in this thing

Lindsey is flipping switches Nothing works

BUD
You totaled it huh

LINDSEY
Yeah So sue me

Bud looks down Theres already about a foot of water
sloshing around the floor at their feet

BUD
Its flooding like a son of the
bitch

LINDSEY

You noticed
She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone
LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Deepcore Deepcore this is Cab
One over

She waits No response

BUD
Try again

LINDSEY
Deepcore this is Cab One We need
assistance over Deepcore this--

With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light a power panel shorts
out and everything goes black

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Well thats that

BUD
Wonderful
(looking around)
Theres some light from
somewhere

A faint illumination dimmer than moonlight washes in
through the front port Lindsey scrunches up against the
acrylic and scans the darkness

LINDSEY
Over there Its the rig

A glow beyond a rock promontory like the lights of a
town just over the hill in the desert

BUD
Good hundred yards Id say

LINDSEY
Theyll come out after us

BUD
Yeah but its gonna take them a
while to find us We better get
this flooding stopped

He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light Using the
thing like a bulky flashlight The water is really pouring
in spraying them like a shower almost two feet deep
already

LINDSEY
You see where its coming in

BUD
Somewhere behind this panel Hold
this

She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld
which is blocked by a steel switch panel and a bunch of
conduit

BUD (CONT’D)
Cant get to it Have to pull this
panel off You go any tools

LINDSEY
I dont know look around

Bud scans the cramped interior feels around under the
water Its past his knees

BUD
Nothing Son of a bitch All I
needs a goddamn crescent wrench

He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it
trying to wrench it off the wall Heaves on it repeatedly
Finally stops panting Hes breathing hard now and its
not just effort

BUD (CONTD)
Son of a bitch

LINDSEY
Calm down Bud

A nervous edge in her voice now Buds turning all around
looking around for anything trying to think fast Water up

to their waists The sea closing in
BUD
Okay okay We gotta get you out
of here
LINDSEY
How
BUD

I dont know how

LINDSEY
Weve only got one suit

BUD
I know I know But we better
come up with something

LINDSEY
Aaargh Im freezing

She climbs up on the pilots seat scrunching right up
against the ceiling keeping as much of herself as possible
out of the frigid water Shes shaking all over with the
cold and getting drenched from above by water pouring in

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Okay look you swim to the rig and
come back with another suit

BUD
Seven eight minute swim each
way not enough time Look at

this
(the rate of flooding)
Time I get back youll be--

That stops the conversation for a second About two feet of
airspace left Bud cant believe what this is coming down
to They both stare at each other for a long moment

He makes a decision Starts pulling off his backpack

BUD (CONT’D)
Alright put this on

LINDSEY
What you growing gills all of a
sudden You got it on keep it on

BUD
Dont argue goddamnit just--

LINDSEY
No way Forget it Not an option

Bud has his pack off uncoupling it She keeps fighting his
hands stopping him hooking it back up The desperation of
the situation fuel the struggle

BUD
Lindsey just put the thing on and
shut up--
LINDSEY
NO Now be logical Bud youre--
BUD
FUCK LOGIC

Theyre both right up against the ceiling water up to their
chests Lindseys lips are blue and trembling from the cold

LINDSEY
Listen will you listen to me for
a second Youre for the suit on
and youre a better swimmer than
me Right So I got a plan

BUD
Whats the plan

LINDSEY
I drown you tow me back to the rig-

BUD
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT

Lindseys gut-scared shaking violently her eyes wide
But shes keeping it together Thinking it out Bud see
the bottomless pit opening to take her and he can barely
think

LINDSEY
Look this water is only a couple
degrees above freezing I drown
I go into deep hypothermia my
blood like icewater I can maybe
be revived after ten fifteen
minutes You got all the stuff to
do it on the rig

Bud stops moving and looks into her face inches from him
The water is up to their necks He knows that as always
infuriatingly Lindsey is right

BUD
It is insane
LINDSEY
Its the only way Bud Now trust

me

She takes a deep breath Before her nerve fails she busies
her hands on his suit rehooking everything

BUD
Jesus I dont believe this is
happening

She raise his helmet Water up to their chins They lock
eyes inches apart He can feel her breath on his face
maybe for the last time

BUD (CONT’D)
Oh God Lins I--

LINDSEY
Tell me later

He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his
They lock together in a fierce kiss fueled by passion and
terror the naked realization of love hanging over the
abyss of death

She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly
pulls his helmet over his head Seats is down over the neck
ring Lock the bail-out handle sealing it Even with her
head press up into the highest point of the ceiling
Lindseys mouth is barely above water She give a scared
little laugh

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
This is maybe not such a great
plan is it

She is half-paralyzed with the cold shaking pathetically
Puts her face to the glass of his helmet Seconds to go

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Hold me Hold me Bud Im so
scared

He cant hear her but he read her lips They clutch each
other desperately The embrace last while the water rises
over her mouth and nose She starts to choke Her hands
grip his shoulders like claws She bucks and thrashes Bud
holds her and a scream tears loose from him a pure agony
of the soul

BUD
NOOOOO

The freezing seawater races into her lungs Her finger go
slack and her hands float lifelessly

Bud stares transfixed as the last tiny bubble trickles out
of Lindseys open mouth He kicks himself into gear
fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of the lockout hatch

The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in He picks up
the CPR cart meant to roll on wheels and carries it out

past Hippy Catfish and One Night who are crowding in to
get the rest of the equipment They ransack the place in

about ten seconds grabbing everything they might need and
half of everything else

EXT DEEPCOREUNDER THE MOONPOOL 204

Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light towing Lindsey
to the diving platform Through the surface we can see the
others arrive at the edge looking down

INT SUB-BAY 205

Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen
kit dropping things making mistakes One Night is
teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a bottle of
adrenaline

SONNY
Here he comes

Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water waist deep on
the submerged diving platform Bud bursts to the surface
Together they haul Lindsey across the platform out of the
water and onto the deck Her skin is blue- white her
chest still

Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy like a man
possessed a man with a mission The others are galvanized
by his energy even though they all see Lindsey as dead a
corpse cold and inert Water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue her limbs completely limp
Hippy peels back one eyelid to find the pupil fixed and
dilated

But when Bud shouts for them to move they move

BUD
Turn her over

They flip his wifes body over He straddles her pushing
down with both hands in the middle of her back Seawater
gushes from her slack lips He does it again until the flow
stops then flips her onto her back

BUD (CONTD)
Come on hurry Gimme the de-
fib

One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart
equipment Theyve all been trained in CPR and use of the
gear but that was years ago and is a friend theyre working
on Theyre all thumbs Catfish drops the electrodes
picks them up quickly hands them to Bud

CATFISH
Here here here no you got to
have bare skin or it wont

Bud rips into her clothing opening her jumpsuit literally
tearing away her T-shirt revealing her bare chest bony
and still

BUD
Jesus Gimme those come on
Catfish move it man Come on
come on

He slaps the things into Lindseys bare skin one on the
sternum and one on the side of the rib cage

BUD (CONT’D)
Is that it Is this right

HIPPY
Yeah I mean I dont know it
looks right

BUD
All right Do it

One Night hits the switch and Lindseys body convulses It
is a pure muscle reflex and when it is over there is not a
hint of life Hippy pushes him back and puts a black rubber
oxygen mask over her mouth He opens the valve on the
cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag They start
packing electronic blankets around her to fight the intense
hypothermia

BUD (CONT’D)
Do it again One Night Zap her
again

The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches Bud

doesnt wait for a result hes in his own reality now
driven Hes doing it all at once somehow in a senseless
frenzy pumping on her chest with his hands squeezing the

oxygen bag placing the electrodes

BUD (CONT’D)
Aw Christ come on baby
Again Do it again

Lindseys back arches Her body relaxes inert

BUD (CONT’D)
Come on One Night what are you
waiting for

A hush seems to have fallen over the group They know
instinctively that its over But Bud cant accept it He
looks at them beseechingly like they are somehow
intentionally holding out on him One Night starts to cry
quietly

CATFISH

(gently)
Bud its over man Its over

There is a beat of silence Bud stares down into Lindseys
half-open motionless eyes

TIGHT ON LINDSEYS EYES moving in until the pupil FILLS
FRAME a black void

REVERSE HER POV SILENCE A distant distorted image we
see Bud One Night Jammer Hippy Catfish staring down
It is like the circular top of a dark well their faces

shimmering as if through the surface of water It is as if
we are in a well descending looking up at a circle of
faces growing smaller as we drop away smaller and

smaller receding until it becomes a point of light in the
void like the fading bright dot at the center of a turned-
off TV

TIGHT ON BUD rigid staring Catfish puts his hand gently
on Buds shoulder Suddenly Bud tears Catfishs hand away
and sets upon Lindsey like a madman renewing his efforts in
spades totally manic

BUD
No NO Shes not her heart is
strong she wants to live cant
you see that Come on Lins Come
on baby Zap her again Do it
DO IT

They do And Bud works feverishly He lock his lips over
hers and starts mouth-to-mouth It is frantic
passionate the kiss of life

BUD (CONT’D)
Come on breath Goddamn it you
bitch you never backed down from
anything in life now fight

He slaps her face hard Her head lolls He smacks her the
other way

BUD (CONT’D)
Fight Goddamnit

LINDSEYs POV from the bottom of the great well The
circles of faces and light rockets toward us in the
blackness as we soar upward from the pit We see Bud
yelling but his voice is distant windlike

BUD (CONTD)
FIGHT

TIGHT ON LINDSEY still Then something incredible happens
Something they will never forget as long as they live
Lindsey coughs once weakly and her hands clench ina
spasm

Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific
BUD (CONTD)
Come on Lins You can do it

fight your way back baby

The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back

She starts to cough weakly at first then more violently
as she draws air into her lungs Bud crouches over her
rubbing her limbs trying to re- establish circulation

It is like a difficult birth Lindsey comes hacking and
howling back into the world wet and naked and fighting for
breath

Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath
after agonized breath He pushes her wet hair back from her
face with his trembling hands and watches her breathe
Color is returning to her skin as she lies there gasping
weakly

the miracle of her rebirth

hyperventilating with an oxygen mask part of the procedure
for transitioning from air to fluid breathing Monk on his

wrapped in a blanket still looking wan and frail She
doesnt have the strength to resist Buds will but shes
trying

She looks around at the others Sees their eyes The fear
Has her answer He lowers the helmet over his head Catfish
clamps it down We see whats driving him his sense of

responsibility for these people for not being able to
prevent this situation

He touches her cheek one last time She sees his fingers
are trembling Then he puts on the gloves Catifsh is
strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Buds forearm Lindsey wants
to scream to stop this madness

making sound Itll feel a little
strange

The moment of truth huh

His breathing is shallow and tense He looks at Lindsey
The eyes of a condemned man She squeezes his hand He
takes a deep breath

BUD (CONTD)
Okay Lets rock and roll

Monk gently cracks a valve on the suits feed line The
breathing fluid (3M fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into
the helmet Bud reflexively raises his chin The liquid
fills toward his mouth

MONK
Relax now Bud Just keep
breathing as it fills dont

fight it Take it in Just let
yourself take it in

Suddenly theres nothing in there to breathe but liquid
His eyes go wide instant panic He starts to thrash
Chest heaving

Hold him Hold him This is
normal itll pass in a second
Youre gonna be okay We all
breathe liquid for nine months

Lindsey grabs Buds shoulders steadying him He finds her
eyes the look calming him Hes passed into a realm from
which she has already returned His spasms subside He
begins to breathe normally He gets a goofy look of
wonder on his face not really believing what hes
experiencing He is alive alert and quite completely
drowned inside the FBS helmet He grins Gives a big thumbs
up Lindsey picks up a microphone

the edge of the cliff and starts down It grows large
resolving into Bud free-falling down the wall

He gathers speed as Little Geeks vertical thruster drives
them down

Bud looks down Between his feet he can see a short way
down the wall in the glow of his single light and beyond
that an unfathomable blackness The wall unrolls upwards
out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery He
looks up The lights of Deepcore are gone He feels more
alone than he has ever felt He types out CANT SEE YOU

He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position

In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full
circle returned to the womb in which we all breathe the
water of life before we know the world of air and light
Still there is Lindseys voice faintly in his helmet

LINDSEY (VO)
You remember that time you were
pretty drunk you probably dont
remember the power went out at
the old apartment the one on
Orange Street and we were
staring at that one little candle
and I said something really dumb
like that candle is me like every
one of us is out there alone in the
dark in this life

INT CONTROL MODULE 224

TIGHT ON LINDSEY as she grips the microphone Her voice has
become a hoarse whisper Her eyes are intense focused on a
point far beyond the walls of the room

LINDSEY
and you lit another candle and

put it beside mine and said thats
me and we stared at the two
candles and then we well if
you remember any of it Im sure
you remember the next part Bud
there are two candles in the dark

(MORE )

LINDSEY (CONTD)
Im with you Ill always be with
you

EXT THE ABYSS 225

A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall
Bud falls on in dream-like solitude a candle in the dark

INT CONTROL MODULE 226

Catfish gently takes the microphone from Lindseys hands and
leans close

CATFISH
How you doin podner Still with
us come-back Talk to us Buddy
boy

They watch the screen expectantly

Nothing Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment
Lindsey tried unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here

LINDSEY

There is an agonizing pause then the letters appear slowly
SHAKING STOPED

What kind of light
LIGHT EVYWHER BEAWTIFULLL 228
MONK

Hes hallucinating badly
EXT THE ABYSS 229
Bud is no longer in pain His expression is rapt

LOOKING DOWN past his to a ghostly landscape His last
flare sputters out but there is light Bioluminescent
algae carpet the walls of the canyon below him And hes
right it is beautiful

The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Buds
tiny silhouetted figure to a vast landscape faintly
revealed in spectral pastels Barren as the moon but
exquisite serene Changeless

A place unseen by human eyes Like a firefly below the
lights of Big Geek are visible Bud descends toward the
ROV which has grounded on a narrow shelf Below the shelf
the wall slopes out suggesting we are near the bottom of
the canyon but cant see it

ONE BIG GEEKMIRV sitting there like a dumbshit Buds
feet thump into the sediment next to it stirring it
luminous particles Touchdown three and half miles of
water over his head Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm
of fireflies

Lindsey

MONK
Okay Bud well go step by step
Take the cover plate off the firing
box

A long pause Then PLATE OFF

MONK (CONT’D)
All right Bud you have to cut the
ground wire not the lead wire

EXT ABYSSAL LEDGE 231

Bud is peering into the detonator unit How bad is he We
cant tell

MONK (VO)
Its the blue wire with the white
stripe not I repeat NOT the
black wire with the yellow stripe

Bud is staring Blinking The two wire look big as sewer
pipes and theyre miles away way down there where his
hands are

The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK He pulls out
the little plastic tube Breaks and shakes It starts to
glow a tiny wand of green light He fumbles with his tool
pouch takes out a pair of side-cutters CUTING NNOW he
types to them He reaches into the detonator

DETAIL THE WIRES in the green Cyalume glow the look
identical The cutters go over on wire A long beat They
withdraw then go over the other wire

He cuts--

A cheer goes up Rebel yells

expression is enigmatic He looks around slowly at the
luminous canyon Starts to type

234 INT CONTROL MODULE 234

The message comes in NO THINK ILL STAY A WHILE
BEAUTIFUL HERE WORTH ADMISSION

LINDSEY
No You can make it You hear me
Drop your weights you can
breathe shallow you it could

Lindseys voice has twisted into a sob She begins to weep
quietly

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Oh God Virgil please
DONT CRY BABY 235
A pause Then the words

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING DB6
BUT YOU KNOW I

HAD TO COME 237
Lindsey sobs at the mike The others look away The signal
is weakening One Night boosts it and the screen clears
briefly

She stares at the printout

LINDSEY
Love you
There is no reply
CUT TO
EXT THE ABYSS 239

A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV an Indian
dying with his horse in the desert

Buds eyelids close His chest barely moving

A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open
He blinks Weakly he raises his head facing the source of
the radiance

BUDS POV A glowing figure hovers before him like a
vision It seems to be an angel Seen closer as it drifts
toward him we see that it is an extraterrestrial being
bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish Its body and limbs
are transparent and it resembles a figure made of blown
glass A delicate mantle or veil billows out around its
like a corona which pulsates gently propelling the being
with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer The head is
refined and strangely anthropomorphic with large eyes that
convey a cold dispassionate wisdom

It is stunningly beautiful

The creature settles toward him Unafraid Bud extends his
hand

Its slender blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove It
pulls him up from the benthic ooze and they glide together
down the slope deeper into the abyss

At the limits of visibility we see faint glowing forms
moving below They resolve into NTI ships Tiny ovoids
like the little scoutship that Lindsey nearly collided with
at the Montana wreck The larger manta-ships And others
strangely configured moving in the darkness below like
luminous fish

Suddenly the darkness explodes with light A vast
reticulated pattern of brightly glowing lines like some
enormous circuit diagram appears below them covering the
floor of the abyssal trench It sweeps outward from the
center as if the light were surging through channels The
NTIs are revealing their home to Bud The ships move among
the spires like air traffic over a major city

EXT NTI STRUCTURE 240

Bud and the creature descend until between the lines of
light we see a dark surface of inhuman design The shape
extends beyond the limits of visibility Towers hundreds of
feet high stretch upward from the curving surface It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it approaching
an opening that soon yawns like a vast mouth

They are picking up speed swept along by a powerful
current into the mouth- like opening

INT NTI STRUCTURE 241

Bud stares around in awe as smooth pearlescent walls blur
past him It is a curving three-dimensional maze of
tunnels like a vast circulatory system where controlled
currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional
space Tunnels divide narrow and reenter main-routes
hundreds of feet across as the pair race through ina
dizzying blur

INT FINAL CHAMBER 242

Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor and the
NTI moves back a few feet

A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical
curtain bisecting the chamber The seawater divides like
the Red Sea into two rippling walls They move apart
Leaving Bud standing in a short shimmering hallway

Weakly he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free Drops to
his knees Doubles over as spasms wrack him Breathing
fluid explodes from his lungs

He lies gasping and coughing on the floor dragging in deep
breaths of what he can only hope is air It is

Bud slowly recovers sitting up His head is clearing

This really is happening Beyond the shimmering vertical
surface of the water he sees the NTI being joined by others
move or less identical until a group of seven is gathered
watching him

BUD
Howdy Uuuh how you guys doin

His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber Soft
laps of water from the walls

In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears a series of
what appears to be circuit diagrams Bud staggers back from
this strange screen hanging in mid-air The image is
about twenty feet across

There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which
resolves into the face of Dan Rather doing the evening
news STATIC then another newscast And another
Fragments of the same story The world on the brink of war

BUD (CONTD)
You watch out TV That what youre
trying to say That you know
whats been going on up there

The NTIs are impassive Static then another newscast

This time were allowed to focus on the story An on-the-
scene interview outside a high-tech seismology lab There
is an air of hysteria about the scene technicians running
across the background of the shot people shouting the
reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist

REPORTER
» a Caltech scientist who is
among those reporting an
unprecedented disturbance in the
worlds oceans Dr Breg can you
give us a clearer explanation then
were getting

Berg is edgy and distracted People keeps handing him
pieces of paper computer hardcopy The biggest thing in
his life is happening

BERG
Theyre acoustic shockwaves like
tsunamis but with no seismological
source

(MORE )

BERG (CONTD)
The waves are propagating toward
the shorelines of every continent--

An assistant runs up face shiny with fear beckoning We
see that Berg is running scared The impossible bringing
the greatest terror to the rational mind

BERG (CONT’D)
Yeah Ill be right there I
have to go Look we dont know
what it is Okay Not the
slightest goddamn idea

The image dissolves into static fades out Bud turns to
the NTIs

BUD
Youre doing it Right Thats
what youre telling me Yeah you
can control water thats your
technology But why

Static again then a brilliant flash Grainy stock film of
a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific

The film repeats and then again faster and again until is
merges into an unbroken white glare Bud gets the message

BUD (CONT’D)
Hey you dont know theyre really
gonna do it Where do you get off
passing judgment on us when you
cant be sure How do you know

The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing
images stark moments from recent history

US soldiers fighting in Vietnam street warfare in Beirut a
car bomb in Belfast a suspect shot in the head in the
streets of Saigon burned and bleeding children grainy
footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at Auschwitz
Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review a 13-year-
old contra with an AK-47 Just glimpses strobing a
few frames of each But enough The images continue

HOLD ON BUD as the lights flicker on his face the ongoing
indictment of humanity

EXT BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN 273
A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred
yards off not swirling down like a whirlpool just dimpling
down
It gets wider Deeper Rapidly becomes a yawning pit

The ocean is OPENING

Now the surface is churned by turbulence Slow massive
roils of tremendous power boil up from the depths

McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better
The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across

The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the
maelstrom

SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING A massive
spire Smoothly curving and iridescent Off the starboard
beam a quarter mile away another spire rises Tons of
seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR the
energy of Niagara

Off the port bow another spire

And another beyond the destroyer Albany dwarfing it
Six towers plus one larger in the center Rising
One the Explorers deck a shadow engulfs them as the

nearest spire blocks out the sun The air the sea the

clunking massively to one side as it settles

off the back of the vast slightly curved hull The missile
cruiser rocks back and forth nearby high and dry its
