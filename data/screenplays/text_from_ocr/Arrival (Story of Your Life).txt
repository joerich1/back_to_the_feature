FADE IN

EXT STARFIELD IN SKY - NIGHT

A shimmering expanse of stars packed together
A clear night far from light pollution

LOUISE (VO)
Memory is a strange thing
EXT LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

A modern home built on the shore with a large deck
The skin of the lake is a cloudy mirror

LOUISE BANKS stares up at the sky leaning against the deck’s
railing Merlot glass in one hand

Louise has a clean timeless look about her the kind of
woman who ages gracefully Eyes that make people comment she
must have an “old soul” Short hair

LOUISE (V0O)
It doesn’t work like I thought it
did We are so bound by time by
its order
Closing on Louise’s face still stargazing

A MAN steps onto the deck Out of focus Approaches OC

LOUISE (VO)
Maybe there’s a higher order

Louise looks over at the Man who’s joined her Smiles

Their hands clasp together
His thumb traces her knuckles

LOUISE (V0O)
I used to think this was the
beginning of your story

MAN (0S)
Louise Do you want to make a
baby

Louise beams Her eyes get wet but she holds it in

It’s clear what her answer will be
INT HOSPITAL - MORNING
Louise cradles a NEWBORN GIRL in her arms Her name

Hannah reaches up
Crooks her tiny hand around Louise’s finger

LOUISE (V0O)
I remember moments in the middle
EXT BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
Four-year-old HANNAH dressed as a cowgirl
On a toy riding horse with wheels for hooves
Giggling like she can’t stop
She pulls both finger-guns aimed at us
HANNAH
Stick ‘em up
INT HANNAH’S ROOM - NIGHT

Eight-year-old Hannah is tucked in bed
Said to us as a prayer

HANNAH
I love you
INT LOUISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Twelve-year-old Hannah glowers at us

HANNAH
I hate you

--and storms into her room

INT HOSPITAL - MORNING

Fifteen-year-old daughter HANNAH lies eyes closed

HANNAH

Hannah is too pale to be alive Her head has been shaved in

the last month

LOUISE (V0O)
And this was the end

Louise holds her daughter’s hand in hers
Her thumb traces Hannah’s knuckles
A life monitor beeps as Hannah’s heart stops

Louise’s grip on her daughter tightens
Trembling Knuckles flaring white

A nurse hovers nearby shutting down monitors
LOUISE (V0O)
But now I’m not so sure I believe
in beginnings and endings There
are days that define your story
beyond your life
CUT TO BLACK
LOUISE (VO)
Like the day they arrived
EXT SKY - DAY
Storybook blue patched with cumulous clouds
Drifting down to find a tree line in motion
Looking into a car on a road
EXT LOUISE’S SEDAN - DAY

Louise drives Shadows slide over the windshield

She looks older here Hardened Maybe even haunted
Her hairstyle is different longer

File boxes full of books occupy the back seat of her sedan
No child seat No wedding band on her finger

EXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Louise pulls into a faculty lot and enters campus

Overhead a pair of F-18 fighters slice across the sky

EXT STUDENT CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

Louise crosses the campus center

A crowd of STUDENTS are huddled around the glass outside the
student center looking in at a large TV The crowd is too

dense for Louise to see what is on the TV

Louise frowns but keeps going
Overhead a second pair of fighter jets rocket past

Louise looks up at the sky Apprehensive

INT UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM - DAY

Louise enters a classroom nearly full with STUDENTS most
already buried in books or with their laptops open

LOUISE
Chapter five everybody Today we
learn why Portuguese sounds unlike
any other Romance language
The kids crack open textbooks as Louise settles at her desk

The course name is written on the blackboard behind Louise
“Advanced Linguistics” and “Dr Louise Banks”

Someone’s cell phone dings Text message
Louise scans the class
Another phone chimes with its text message
LOUISE (CONTD)
Did someone forget my cell phone

rule

FEMALE STUDENT
Sorry

But the Student is drawn back to her phone

More phones buzz and chirp A wave of alerts wash over the
classroom Like a room of clocks all going off at once

Louise frowns Stands up
Chatter among the students now looking to one another

MALE STUDENT
CNN has up-close footage in Japan

STUDENT WITH LAPTOP
Where do I find that

LOUISE
I’m close to making you all doa
report on the Luddites

Students are crowding around their closest neighbor with a
large laptop and wifi access The tension in the room
continues to escalate as more students witness footage

MALE STUDENT
Holy shit

STUDENT 3
It’s on all the feeds

LOUISE
What’s going on

STUDENT WITH LAPTOP
Turn on the TV Dr Banks

Louise grabs a TV remote off her desk and powers on a
flatscreen bolted to the wall in the classroom

LOUISE
What chan--

SEVERAL STUDENTS
(interrupting)
Any of them

The screen comes to life to reveal AERIAL NEWS COVERAGE of a
field in the wilderness

Center-stage in the field is a STRANGE SPHERICAL OBJECT a
perfect globe of metal It reflects sunlight like its surface
is water But reflections on its skin distort in odd ways
creating an unnerving optical illusion that it’s bringing the
trees of the forest up against it

But it’s not The tall grass and trees around the object have
been flattened as if pressed down from concussive force

Another helicopter edges into view overhead and suddenly the
scale of the object is clear

It’s at least ten stories tall

Bumper text at the bottom of the screen reads
“STRANGE CRAFT LANDS IN MONTANA”

Louise turns up the volume

ANCHORMAN (VO)
--and apparently touched down forty
minutes ago just north of I-94
were we’re waiting to hear if
this is perhaps an experimental
vessel or something else--
More footage closer to the ground The spherical ship is
immense And seemingly without creases or windows

ANCHORWOMAN (VO)
Actually correspondents on Twitter
are saying more objects like this
have landed in as many as eight
other locations around the world
We’re waiting for confirmation--
yes Can we-- Okay--

The footage changes to a live feed in Hokkaido Japan An
identical SPHERE is parked in a stadium parking lot

ANCHORWOMAN (VO)
This is from a site in Japan

Chatter in the classroom is reaching unmanageable levels
Everyone talking to everyone else Some on their phones

Louise mutes the TV and addresses them

LOUISE
Settle down Settle down

The kids obey halfway

MALE STUDENT
It’s aliens

STUDENT WITH LAPTOP
You don’t know that yet

MALE STUDENT
Come on Are you going to argue
this

More chatter now from the university halls Classes are
spilling out Louise’s attention keeps going back to the TV

ROTC STUDENT
This is like nine-eleven It’s
another attack

FEMALE STUDENT
Shut up No one’s been killed

ROTC STUDENT
Yet

Another FEMALE STUDENT gets up and hurries for the door
Hiding her face She’s crying
The unease and shock of this emerging event is spreading
through the whole class Louise sees it start to happen

LOUISE
Let’s just take a breath We don’t
know what this is yet But I
wouldn’t be surprised if it’s some
new aerospace project

STUDENT WITH LAPTOP
That is not a plane

LOUISE
Or whatever it is

Louise looks back at the TV Clearly mystified by it
The spherical object defies explanation

ROTC STUDENT
What if it’s really aliens

LOUISE
It’s not aliens I promise you all
get the week off if it is

Her focus returns to the muted TV screen She turns it off
and the black screen reflects her troubled face

The class bell RINGS--

INT LOUISE’S SEDAN - EVENING
Louise drives home Listening to the radio

PRESS SECRETARY (V0)
But for now we’re simply asking for
cooperation while authorities
assess the object Until further
notice the site is a no-fly zone

Outside on the street

- A car accident ahead A pickup has rear-ended a hybrid

- A WOMAN is on a cell phone in tears

- A YOUNG MAN paces on a front lawn with blood on his shirt

REPORTER (VO)
So you’re saying it’s not ours Do
you know if it’s even from Earth

Louise slows to a crawl avoiding the wreck on the street
PRESS SECRETARY (V0)
We’re still collecting information
coordinating with other nations
We’re not the only ones with one of
these in our back yard

A group of PEOPLE stand at the curb looking up at the sky
But nothing is there

REPORTER (VO)
If this is some sort of peaceful
first contact why send twelve
Why not just one

Louise turns off the radio

EXT LOUISE’S HOUSE - EVENING

Her sedan pulls up at the lake house from the opener

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER
Louise alone on the couch Half a bottle of wine left

The place is furnished nicely but there are telltale signs
of a single occupant in a larger space No family photos

A recliner by the couch has become a surrogate bookshelf
TV is on More coverage of the alien landing
ANCHORMAN (VO)
and at around eight hours after
landing there are still no signs
of what might be called ‘first

contact’

Changing channel Footage changes to a snowy tundra where
another UFO has landed and flattened a section of fence line

This is a foreign channel Louise gets international
stations The anchor speaks in Russian

Two different military forces rally around the sphere
Spotlights shine on its surface Armed men surround it

The cameraman is shoved away by soldiers
New channel Another SPHERE hovering over the ocean

Fleets from three different nations threaten each other for
possession of the massive UFO
BRIAN WILLIAMS (VO)
--none of whom can claim because
this ‘object’ as it’s being called
is actually hovering over
international waters One Iranian
cruiser has fired across the bow of
the Indian fleet--
Louise changes the channel
Finding The press room in the west wing of the White House
PRESS SECRETARY
We have to entertain the idea that
if it is a kind of vessel it may
be unmanned
The reporters clamor for answers shouting over each other
Louise lets out a tired breath turns off the TV and tosses
the remote She’s lost interest

INT LOUISE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Louise is asleep in bed The covers are a mess She’s
spooning extra pillows as if they were a bedfellow

She wakes with a start as if from a dream

EXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MORNING
Louise returns to work

The campus is empty Two students hurry between buildings

Louise passes the student center

It’s too quiet

INT UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM - MORNING
Louise enters her classroom Stops
No one has showed up

A note is scrawled on her blackboard
“ALIENS SEE YOU NEXT WEEK”

Louise sighs

INT LOUISE’S OFFICE - EVENING
A cramped office with a window looking out on the city
Sirens wail in the distance

Louise has barely decorated the place It’s the sign of
someone untethered from the world Closed off

Louise sits at her desk working on her syllabus
Streaming video news coverage plays on her computer

ANCHORMAN (VO)
Forty-eight hours later and still
no word from any nation on first
contact Borders are closed and
flights grounded STATIC--

Louise’s monitor winks off
She frowns at it Tries to reboot No luck

COLONEL WEBER (0S)
That was my fault

Louise turns to see the source of the voice at her office
door COLONEL WEBER (50s) wears civilian clothing but his
body language screams career military Callused hands sharp
eyes rigid posture

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
Precautionary measure as you’ll
soon find out It will reboot after
I leave

Behind Weber two large MEN stand guard in the hall

LOUISE
Who are you

Weber has his ID ready shows it to her

COLONEL WEBER
I’m Colonel Richard Weber You and
I never formally met but two years
ago you did some Farsi translation
for Army Intelligence

LOUISE
I remember Alan Boudreau hired me
COLONEL WEBER
Alan works for me You made quick
work of those insurgent videos

Louise crosses her arms He’s touched a nerve
LOUISE
You made quick work of those

insurgents

COLONEL WEBER
That’s what we do

LOUISE
Uh-huh

COLONEL WEBER
Point is you’re at the top of
everyone’s list when it comes to
translation and you have another
two years on your SSBI so you still
have top secret clearance And
that’s why I’m in your office and
not at Berkeley

LOUISE
Okay

COLONEL WEBER
I need you to translate something
for me

Colonel Weber places a pocket-sized digital recorder on
Louise’s desk

He hits PLAY
White noise shuffling Then murmured talk and
MAN’S VOICE
(on recorder )
Why are you here
In response A SERIES OF SOUNDS that have no Earthly
comparison An audio mixture of organic clicks rushing
water whispers and low-octave moaning
Beat
MANS VOICE (CONTD)

(on recorder )
Can you understand us

Almost immediately the SOUNDS return this time slightly
different The bass tone is lower The whispers raspy

Louise listens rapt As if she’s waking up from a long
sleep She leans in

Weber studies her face while she listens
MANS VOICE (CONTD)
(on recorder )

Do you come in peace

Before an answer is heard Weber stops playback and takes
back the recorder

COLONEL WEBER
Well What do you make of it

LOUISE
Is that

COLONEL WEBER
Yes

LOUISE
How many

COLONEL WEBER
How many what

LOUISE
How many of them were speaking

Weber raises an eyebrow at her but answers
COLONEL WEBER
Two Assume they were not speaking

at the same time

LOUISE
Are you sure Do they have mouths

COLONEL WEBER
Keep your focus on the sounds

Weber replays a portion of the recording The alien VOICE
sounds even stranger a second time

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
What would be your approach to
translating this Does any of it
sound like words to you Phrases
LOUISE
I don’t know

COLONEL WEBER
(said not as a question)
What can you tell me

LOUISE
I can tell you it’s impossible to
translate this from an audio file
To do this right I need to be
there I need to be in the room
interacting with them

Weber bristles at this

COLONEL WEBER
You didn’t need that for the Farsi
translations

LOUISE
It was Dari not Farsi and I
didn’t need it because I already
knew the language This--
(points at recorder)
This is a whole new ball game You
have to throw out the rule book

COLONEL WEBER
I know what you’re doing

LOUISE
Tell me what I’m doing

COLONEL WEBER
I’m not here to take you to
Montana It’s all I can do to keep
it from becoming a tourist site for
anyone with TS clearance Like it’s
goddamn Disneyworld

LOUISE
I’m not asking for a ticket to a
show Colonel I’m talking about
doing a job

COLONEL WEBER
We will set up a safe room at a
facility here in town where you can
observe video of the conversations
in real-time I’11 put you on the
line with our team at the site

LOUISE

COLONEL WEBER
(beat)
What do you mean ‘no’

LOUISE
It won’t work that way

COLONEL WEBER
You’11 make it work

Her patience wears thin

LOUISE
Colonel have they spoken to us in
English

COLONEL WEBER
No

LOUISE
Have they played back any of our
media or given you any indication
they understand us

Weber doesn’t have a reply for this His eyes shift

LOUISE (CONTD)
So in order for this to work I
have to teach them English The
basics Nouns verbs I can’t do
that remotely I have to be in the
room with them

Weber and Louise stare down

COLONEL WEBER
There is one opportunity here and
that is to study them remotely If
I leave here your chance is gone

Weber turns to leave
Not content to let that be the end of it

LOUISE
You going to ask Danvers next

Weber pauses at the door

COLONEL WEBER
Maybe why

She grins
LOUISE
Ask him the Sanskrit word for “war”
and its translation
Weber’s jaws clench
After the door shuts behind him Louise’s computer wakes up
again Louise keeps staring at the door Her grin fades

INT LOUISE’S BEDROOM - DAWN

Louise is asleep in her bed Again with the formation of
pillows around her

She wakes to a rhythmic thumping Low dull
Her hand goes to her heart It’s not her heart

The thumping gets louder A helicopter

INT LOUISE’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dressed in a bathrobe Louise crosses to the front windows
looking out on her wide flat front yard

A Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter has touched down on the
lawn The passenger door is open slid back to reveal someone
riding in the rear compartment

Her doorbell rings

Louise answers it

Weber stands at the door

COLONEL WEBER
Good morning

LOUISE
Colonel

COLONEL WEBER
Gavisti

LOUISE
That’s the word But what did
Danvers say it means in Sanskrit

COLONEL WEBER
He said it means an argument
What does it really mean

LOUISE
“RK desire for more cows”

COLONEL WEBER
Pack your bags

It hits Louise She got the job

LOUISE
All right Give me twenty minutes

COLONEL WEBER
You have ten

Louise glares at Weber for just a moment then dashes off to
her bedroom
INT BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER - MORNING

Louise (now dressed and carrying an overnight bag) hurries
for the passenger compartment

The rotor blades flatten the grass on her lawn and pull at
Louise’s coat

NEIGHBORS across the street have stepped out on their
driveways curious about the helicopter

Weber helps Louise inside and then shuts the door
The helicopter rises immediately

Beyond the lake house A small town Suburban
Farther out The city

Louise drops into a bench seat still holding her bag
As she buckles in

IAN (0S)
Language is the foundation of
civilization

Across from her IAN DONNELLY (late 30s) Oxford shirt wild
hair fierce eyes Ian holds a book He’s reading from it

LOUISE
Pardon

IAN
“It is the glue that holds a people
together and it is the first
weapon drawn in a conflict Without
language we are nothing”

COLONEL WEBER
Louise this is Ian Donnelly

Neither Louise nor Ian offer to shake hands They study one
another as they talk

LOUISE
That’s quite a greeting

IAN
You wrote it

LOUISE
It’s the kind of thing you write as
a preface Dazzle them with basics

IAN

It’s good Even if it’s wrong
LOUISE

Wrong
IAN

The cornerstone of civilization
isn’t language It’s science Man
doesn’t need to tell everyone how
to make fire He just has to burn
them with it

COLONEL WEBER
Ian is an astrophysicist on loan
from NASA He is the man with the
questions You will be reporting to
me but you’ll take direction from
him when you’re in the shell

LOUISE
The shell

IAN
That’s what they’re calling the UFO

LOUISE
So it is a ship then

Weber ignores that comment and plunges ahead
It sinks in with Louise

COLONEL WEBER
We need to get a basic grasp of
their language as soon as possible
with emphasis on science and math
concepts If you don’t understand
what Ian wants translated ask him
to clarify

LOUISE
What’s the rush

IAN
Japan and Russia already have teams
assembled at their landing sites

COLONEL WEBER
China and Sweden now too Time is
our enemy now

LOUISE
I don’t understand What progress
have the other teams made

COLONEL WEBER
We don’t know No one’s talking
anymore

LOUISE
Who stopped talking first

Weber looks at Ian Nods

IAN
Japan and Russia

COLONEL WEBER
Followed early this morning by
China and Sweden
(beat)
It’s a race

The other sites have learned

something Something they don’t want anyone else to know

EXT MONTANA LANDING SITE - DAY

Wide angle on approach A mile out

Roads and highways are crowded with traffic up against

impassable military blockades

In the distance The ALIEN SPHERE

It dwarfs the wilderness around it and stands out like a
pinball dropped in a tiny terrarium Its metal skin suggests
movement rotation or distortion Yet it remains immobile

At this distance a low DRONE starts to resonate in
everyone’s sternum

The Blackhawk lances over the treeline

EXT BASE CAMP - DAY
The spherical ship towers over the field where it landed Its
lack of front back up or down give it the appearance that
it could roll in any direction
In the flattened grass from its impact a series of tents
have been erected Up close the ship looks majestic ominous
INT BLACKHAWK - CONTINUOUS
Louise and Ian stare out the side window at the ship
COLONEL WEBER

Every thirteen hours a series of

circular portals line up and forma

tunnel to a chamber inside

(beat)
That’s where they meet us

A phone handset’s cradle lights up by Weber He answers it

LOUISE
When’s the next meeting

Ian shrugs -- he just got here
Weber hangs up

COLONEL WEBER
They’re waiting for us now

LOUISE
The aliens Are waiting for us
EXT HELIPAD - MOMENTS LATER

Colonel Weber Ian and Louise are escorted out of the
helicopter and into base camp

LT MARKS (barely 30 disciplined a man of rules) meets
Weber and updates him as they walk

LT MARKS
Fragment team called in with the
composite results

COLONEL WEBER
Tell me

LT MARKS
Three unknown elements plus trace
levels of Scandium and Gadolinium

COLONEL WEBER
We do anything with those

LT MARKS
One’s an alloy for aerospace
components the other used for MRI
machines

COLONEL WEBER
Take them to Kettler

LT MARKS
Yessir

COLONEL WEBER
(to Ian and Louise)
You will follow this man to
medical The procedure should take
just a few minutes

EXT TENT COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

Lt Marks leads them to a large tent emblazoned with a red
cross on the side

Nearby the sphere looms over them In this position it has
the optical illusion that it’s rolling toward them moments
away from crushing all in its path

A low constant thrum emanates from it At this proximity it
vibrates the fillings in your teeth

Louise looks up at it as they cross to the tent

INT MEDICAL TENT - MOMENTS LATER

A staff of military medical personnel are busy testing new
diagnostic equipment A portable CAT scanner is being
assembled in one corner Another team works with some device
attached to an exam table inside an oxygen tent

Lt Marks opens a flap into a room where we find a man in
scrubs with a tray of hypodermics This is DR KETTLER
professorial even-toned voice but a predator’s eyes

DR KETTLER
Louise Banks and Ian Donnelly

Louise nods Kettler gestures to two plastic chairs They
sit while he prepares a syringe with a vial attached

DR KETTLER (CONT’D)
When is the last time either of you
have eaten

LOUISE
Last night

IAN
Same

DR KETTLER
I’m going to get some blood from
you and give you an immunization
dose that covers a battery of
bacterial threats Roll up your
sleeves please

Ian begins rolling up his Oxford shirt sleeve
Louise notices Ian is complying then follows suit

Kettler moves his tray over and wraps a band around Louise’s
arm just above her elbow As he draws blood

DR KETTLER (CONT’D)
The booster is a kick to your
system so you might feel some side
effects Nausea Dizziness
Headaches A ringing in your ear
like you have Tinnitus

IAN
Oh joy
INT “CLEAN ROOM” - DAY

A miniature Silkwood Contained showers Dressing areas
Full HAZMAT suits hang on a wall

Lt Marks brings Ian and Louise in They each have cotton
swabs taped to their elbows now

LT MARKS
Climb into these I’1l help you
with the helmet seals

IAN
What kind of radiation exposure are
we walking into

LT MARKS
Nominal These are just for safety

LOUISE

Is there physical contact with the
the-- am I the only one who has
trouble saying “aliens”

IAN
No

LOUISE
Thank you

LT MARKS

There’s a wall Like a glass wall
You can’t get to them

LOUISE
What do they look like

A flashing light winks over the exit door
LT MARKS

You’re up
INT OPERATIONS TENT - MOMENTS LATER
Ian and Louise now wearing full moonsuit gear complete with
respirators enter this tent that serves as the nerve center
of base camp
Weber is waiting for them Already suited up like them

Behind him a large white board and rows of flat screen TVs

On the white board Twelve columns with labels of countries
CHINA JAPAN SWEDEN PERU RUSSIA etc

Information is written under the columns and spy satellite
plus location photos are peppered throughout It shows what
every country is doing at their separate ship sites

Studying the board is a MAN in a suit and tie Arms crossed
over his chest This is AGENT HALPERN We’1l see him again

COLONEL WEBER
Remember We need answers as soon
as possible Why they are here
What they want what they will give
us This is the priority

Ian frowns

IAN
What about teaching them our
numerical system so I can get into
conceptual physics

COLONEL WEBER
All the math in the world isn’t
going to help us if they’re
hostile

LOUISE
You think a hostile race would just
land and start talking to us

COLONEL WEBER
You’re the one who said language is
the first weapon drawn in conflict
So let’s not rule anything out

Ian and Louise exchange glances as Weber leads them out of
the ops tent

EXT SPACE SHIP - MOMENTS LATER

The craft is even more intimidating close-up Its surface on
the undercarriage portion seems to absorb light in a strange

way as if the entire ship were pulsing though it’s not

Louise and Ian join a small contingent of MILITARY PERSONNEL
also in HAZMAT suits

Louise notices the soldiers are all armed

She follows the others along a path marked by heavy
electronics cables

Ahead A round porthole eight feet in diameter is set into
the sphere a notch in the skin of the ship like a recessed
button No other door porthole or window is visible It’s a
smooth enigma of metal

LOUISE
Amazing There’s no front or back

IAN
No visible thrusters either

Suddenly the porthole slides open and it’s as if a thick
sheaf of papers with a hole-punch through its middle aligned
perfectly Hundreds of layers of concentric spheres lock into
position and create a tunnel leading up into the epicenter of
the ship

Louise and Ian pause unsure if they should advance

Weber and Lt Marks go in first with two more MEN carrying
equipment

Ian looks back at Louise smiles then ventures in

INT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

The smooth-bore structure invites vertigo Ten steps in and
it’s hard to tell up from down

Louise reaches out and runs a suit-gloved hand along the
ridges of the tunnel trying to fathom its construction

Behind them the porthole closes to a crescent-moon and then
seals up completely More follow the tunnel shifting behind
them as they advance toward the inner chamber

LOUISE
Colonel Weber It closed

COLONEL WEBER
It does that

IAN
How do we get out

COLONEL WEBER
The tunnel reforms in about forty-
five minutes That’s when we go

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS

The chamber has no hard corners or edges Vaguely
rectangular The floor and the ceiling are made of the same
material and seem to be symmetrical

The room is bisected by a transparent wall

The MEN with Weber and Marks quickly set up an arsenal of

video audio and other recording equipment to face this
glass-like partition Chemical sniffers

Infrared and UV cameras Barometers And most disturbingly
an old-tech detection tool among the high-tech A canary in a
cage

On the other side the room is empty save for a raised
platform the size of a table An identical platform descends
from the ceiling above it

It’s possible the entire ship could be operated if gravity
were reversed and the ceiling was suddenly the floor

Moments after the whole group is inside the room the last
door of the tunnel slides closed containing them

Louise and Ian are speechless
Colonel Weber steps up to them

LOUISE
What happens now

COLONEL WEBER
They arrive

LOUISE
Is this how you’ve met them before
In these suits

COLONEL WEBER
Yes

LOUISE
So they haven’t seen what we look
like normally

COLONEL WEBER
What are you getting at

LOUISE
Context

A sound from the other end of the room quiets them

A door opens like an iris on the far wall

TWO ALIEN FIGURES enter the room and cause a breathtaking
silence

The aliens are elegant lithe creatures bipedal but with
seven appendages along the torso that serve as arms The arms
are spread equally around their cylindrical bodies like
spokes of a wheel

Their heads have eyes and holes that might be mouths or
nostrils or both Their necks give their heads complete
rotational movement 360 degrees

Material that doesn’t seem organic to their bodies is draped
around their arms near the shoulders This is the closest
thing to clothes and a quick way to identify the two aliens
from each other

The lighting in the room and the transparency of the wall
between humans and aliens make it difficult to see details of
the aliens Everything is a bit dark and a bit blurred Their
forms undulate in ways that make them seem like deep-water
fish but it’s unclear whether or not the space on the other
side of the wall is air or something else There is no hint
of cavitation (bubbles) yet the aliens move in a way best
described as “swimming”

They approach the platform and settle behind it

Louise and Ian stare in awe of the creatures

Their lives have led them to here and now one of the few
people on Earth to speak with alien life

Beat

COLONEL WEBER
You’re up Doctor Banks

Louise snaps out of her trance
The aliens stand and stare back
One crooks its head at Louise
IAN
(sotto)
Seven Seven arms

Louise steps forward Hesitant Close to the boundary

LOUISE
Hello

Beat No reaction
Louise points to herself
LOUISE (CONTD)
Human

(repeats )
Human

She points at Ian

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Human

She points at one of the aliens

LOUISE (CONTD)
What are you

Beat The aliens turn their heads to glance at one another
Then back at Louise

LOUISE (CONTD)
(points again)
Human

One of the aliens makes a soft noise that strange waterfall-
whisper-flutter sound It spoke

IAN
What was that

LOUISE
Shh-shh

She points to herself and then the alien who just spoke

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Human You

Whisper-clicks

COLONEL WEBER
That’s it We’re getting somewhere

Beat Louise turns and moves for the closed portal She puts
a hand on it

LOUISE
How do you open this--

COLONEL WEBER
You can’t Not for another forty
minutes

Louise goes to the back of the chamber where Lt Marks
placed spare equipment and other tools in a set of large
moving boxes

She starts digging in the boxes

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
What are you doing

She pulls out a WHITEBOARD tucks it under an arm Grabs a
dry-erase marker

LOUISE
I need a visual aid

She walks briskly past Weber and back to her spot by Ian

IAN
I think they’re watching you

Louise begins writing on the whiteboard
The aliens study her

She shows the whiteboard to them pointing at a word she’s
written in large block letters “HUMAN”

LOUISE
Human
(slower)
Huumaann

She points to herself Then to others on her side of the
room including Weber

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Human

She points at one of the aliens

LOUISE (CONTD)
What are you

Beat
The aliens confer with each other

One uses two of its seven arms to control a console on its
side of the room The console is like an upright desk built
into the floor angled so that we can’t see what it’s writing
or controlling

A brilliant LOGOGRAM appears on the transparent wall before
Louise The writing is a gorgeous hybrid of calligraphy and
line-art symbol It lights up Louise’s face as if it were
written in phosphorescent ink

Py

It looks something like this - ’

The taller slimmer alien steps forward and points at itself
with one arm

It says something Click-flutter-tone

Louise smiles Nearly laughs Wants to cry
She just had her first real exchange with an alien

LOUISE (CONTD)
(sotto)
Are you getting this

Ian checks with a bank of monitors

IAN
Absolutely

EXT BASE CAMP - EVENING

Forty-five minutes later The team exits the ship

Louise still carries the whiteboard around like a talisman
New words have been scrawled on it “MAN WOMAN EARTH”
Ian takes notes on a laptop

Colonel Weber stops Louise before the team reaches the tent

COLONEL WEBER
I didn’t authorize you to teach
them how to read

The HAZMAT helmet-masks and gloves come off now
Louise fires back

LOUISE
Why would I need authorization

COLONEL WEBER
It’s a security risk Do I need to
explain to you what that means

LOUISE
It means if I play my cards right
they’1l take some Shakespeare home
with them

COLONEL WEBER
They may be sitting on a mountain
of data written in English Hell
they may have hacked into all our
websites All they need is to learn
how to read them
LOUISE
It’s the only way this will work

COLONEL WEBER
I doubt other governments are
training these things to read their
language Convince me

Gesturing at the whiteboard

LOUISE
Kangaroo

COLONEL WEBER
What

LOUISE
In 1770 Captain James Cook’s ship
ran aground on the coast of
Australia He led a party into the
country and met the aboriginal
people One of his sailors pointed
to the animals that hopped around
with their young in pouches and
asked what they were called The
aborigine replied “Kanguru”

COLONEL WEBER
What’s your point

LOUISE

It wasn’t until later that they
learned “Kanguru” means “I don’t
understand”

(re whiteboard)
I need this to make sure we don’t
misinterpret things in there
Otherwise this process will take
ten times as long

Time wasted is the key phrase to convince Weber

COLONEL WEBER
All right But submit your
vocabulary before the next session
(beat)
And remember what happened to the
aborigines A more advanced race
nearly wiped them out

Weber walks off with Lt Marks

Ian steps up next to Louise watching the men walk away

IAN
Don’t let him kill your buzz
You just spoke to an extra-
terrestrial

He grins at her She grins back

LOUISE
Not a bad day

IAN
I want to call everyone I know
right now Do you realize how many
arguments this settles Seriously
Who would you call and brag to

Louise’s smile vanishes

LOUISE
I don’t know

Ian gets he’s touched on something but he doesn’t know what

IAN
Oh

LOUISE
I guess what we just do it again
when they return in a few hours

Ian turns around and takes another look at the massive ship
Appraising it like a teenage boy seeing his first Ferrari

IAN
(to the ship)
It’s a date
Louise leaves Ian and approaches the main tent
A faint high-pitched RINGING fades in Louise winces--
INT LOUISE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Louise looks different in this sepia-tone memory Back when
she had short hair

She’s rocking a cocktail dress and pumps donning earrings in
front of a full-length mirror Getting ready for a date

Sound of a TV on elsewhere in the house

LOUISE

(calling out)
Ill be back late but Jennifer is
coming over She’1ll tuck you in
okay little-nose

HANNAH (0OS)
Okay

LOUISE

I don’t want any trouble That
means no pony rancher game after
eight you get too worked up

HANNAH (0S)
Mm-hmm

Louise narrows her eyes Something is amiss with Hannah

INT LOUISE’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Louise steps out to find her daughter HANNAH on the floor
four feet from the TV an animated movie playing on screen

Hannah colors a hand-drawn illustration
She’s the wagging-tongue-when-working-hard type

Same fierce eyes and gentle hair as her mother

LOUISE
Did you hear me babe

HANNAH
(not looking up)
No ponies after eight gotcha

LOUISE
What are you working on there

HANNAH

Mrs Garriott said to draw what my
Saturday morning cartoon would look
like if I had one

Louise is curious now Takes her heels off and crouches down
next to her daughter

LOUISE
Can I see Is that a rocket ship

THE DRAWING depicts a Man and Woman (stick-figures) inside a
flying ship drawn Buck Rogers style A smaller stick figure
sits in the cockpit The piece is colorful

LOUISE (CONTD)
Who are these two in back

HANNAH
You and Daddy The show is called
“Hannah and Mommy and Daddy Save
the World” I’m the captain

Louise’s smile sinks She looks pained
LOUISE
Well That sounds lovely
(beat)
You know it’s okay to be upset
that your daddy and I

Little Hannah breathes through her nose

HANNAH
I know I’m not

Louise brushes Hannah’s hair out of her eyes

LOUISE
We both love you very much
HANNAH
I know
(then)

It’s just a cartoon It’s not real
Louise bites her nails staring at the drawing The strange
RINGING creeps in again and--
EXT BASE CAMP - EVENING

Back to scene moments after the flashback began Louise
stands alone Ahead of her Ian enters the ops tent

She looks back at the ship Confused

EXT MONTANA WILDERNESS - EVENING

High above the tree line looking down at the land near the
landing site Dozens of vehicle headlights bounce and move
off-road approaching a growing cluster of trailers and
trucks parked near the trees

Hundreds of people are making a pilgrimage to the landing
site and amassing at the military barricade a mile out

EXT TREE LINE - THAT MOMENT

Weber emerges from the path back to base camp and surveys the
scene on the ground

Stadium lights on mobile cranes have been rigged and pointed
outward so the soldiers have a clear sight of the barricade
and the clearing

Arcing around Weber our first look at the civilian
encampment outside -- it stretches as far as we can see in
either direction and headlights beyond suggest more arriving
every minute

People crowd around the barricade which isn’t more than a
glorified portable fence with some structural reinforcements
every twenty feet and the occasional HMMV used as a makeshift
guard tower

Civilians line up at it like spectators at a parade The din
of voices is like that of an outdoor stadium during a game

COLONEL WEBER
Jesus

Weber steps up into an armored personnel carrier (APC) that
currently serves as the watch commander’s base

INT APC - CONTINUOUS

Ducking his head Weber enters the rear compartment which
resembles a military camper complete with built-in bench and
table and kitchenette

The watch commander a man named SERGEANT RUTHERFORD sips
from a mug of coffee and stares at a topographical map of the
area laid out on his table

SGT RUTHERFORD
Colonel

COLONEL WEBER
Sergeant That perimeter is too
close to the site

SGT RUTHERFORD
We’re a mile out All due respect
I don’t think anyone expected what
were seeing sir My men have
contained it best we could

COLONEL WEBER
Then we need a new plan

SGT RUTHERFORD
(re map)
We have about four square miles of
barricade to cover But you get me
two hundred more men I can patrol
the entire zone with enough for
three shifts and support staff

COLONEL WEBER
What about monitoring stations
instead-- set down motion
detectors low-light cameras

SGT RUTHERFORD
Not as good We could see a breach
in plenty of time but we won’t have
any boots at the incursion point to
choke it off Best bet youre
catching trespassers as they get to
base camp and that’s too late

COLONEL WEBER
What’s another plan

Rutherford taps the logistics info he’s scrawled on the paper
atop his map “200 MEN”

Weber shakes his head like a catcher denying a pitch signal

SGT RUTHERFORD
Sir Why not

COLONEL WEBER
Think it through sergeant You’re
asking to bring in a battalion of
troops and camp them in a place
where the only potential targets
are creatures from outer space or
their fellow Americans

(beat)

Do you see how that’s a problem

SGT RUTHERFORD
Yes sir Let me show you the bigger
problem

EXT APC - MOMENTS LATER

Rutherford leads Weber back out and points at the amassing
horde of civilians

SGT RUTHERFORD
It’s a couple thousand tonight It
will be twice that by tomorrow

COLONEL WEBER
How much longer can you hold it
here without more men

SGT RUTHERFORD
Three days tops Then either we
need to push out at them or
they’1l start pushing in at us

Weber lets out a deep breath frustrated

EXT STARFIELD IN SKY - NIGHT

A glimmering expanse overhead A shooting star arcs across
the sky with a long tail

EXT BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Two ARMY PRIVATES watch the sky from their guard duty outside
the large barracks tent

The shooting star puts them both on edge One grabs his
assault rifle and gently grips the trigger guard

PRIVATE COMBS
You see that

The other soldier (PRIVATE LASKY) just nods

Nothing happens The two men continue to hold their tension
alert and ready

DRIFTING away from the Soldiers FINDING Ian sitting on the
grass with a sketch pad staring at the spherical alien ship
Where the Private looked at it with dread and suspicion Ian
gazes at it with hope and fascination

IAN
(sotto)
How do you fly

The enormous ship dwarfs him
RICHARD RILEY (VO)

(pre-lap)
Look at that thing

INT TALK SHOW STUDIO SET - MORNING

A political talk show space with a large screen showing the
same Montana sphere Host RICHARD RILEY (a Glenn Beck type)
gestures at it Then gestures at the camera He speaks fast
and emphasizes words as he talks

RICHARD RILEY
This is aliens we’re talking about
The most important time in our
history as a people is right now
first contact with whoever is
inside this thing and who do we
have running the show The
government The same government
that ruined our health care and
bankrupted our military

An image of the cluster of tents around the Montana site
appears obviously shot with a long zoom lens

RICHARD RILEY (CONT’D)
Look at these people Most of them
don’t even have guns We could be
facing a full-scale invasion and
our president is ready to roll over
and let them take our country--

Transmission lines flicker over the scene-- we’re not in the
studio we’re watching it on a TV in

INT OPERATIONS TENT - MORNING

One of several flat screens plays Riley’s rant

Other screens show foreign military forces gathering near
alien spheres in other countries

There’s something unsettling about going from TV footage of
the ship to being right by the real thing

One news program shows riots somewhere Could be Prague
could be Detroit

Some SOLDIERS watch the news screens Among them PRIVATE
LASKY who pays close attention to Riley’s show Nodding
As if he might agree with some of it

Louise enters the tent to find Ian and Weber already here
with other team members Ian has a sketchbook he’s busy with
an art pencil

COLONEL WEBER
(to Ian)
Then we steer it that way and see
what we get

LOUISE
Steer what

COLONEL WEBER
This morning the Korean team
wheeled an exposed engine block and
a balance scale into their sphere
And Japan is using music somehow

LOUISE
Maybe they’re getting desperate and
playing show-and-tell without
learning the language

COLONEL WEBER
And maybe that will work for them
We need to gain ground today You
have your vocabulary list for me

LOUISE
I do It’s long and I don’t know
how long we’1l have in a session

LT MARKS

Around an hour After that they
leave for thirteen hours We
haven’t figured out how to keep
them longer

Weber looks over the list of words

COLONEL WEBER
Youre going to teach them your
name And Ians

IAN
I like it

COLONEL WEBER
I don’t

LOUISE
It’s so I can learn their names If
they have names Plus it will make
my job easier when I have to
introduce pronouns later
COLONEL WEBER

(re list)

These are all grade-school words
Walk Eat Tool We need to get

more specific

LOUISE
Do you know what a Pulaski is

COLONEL WEBER
(beat)
No

LOUISE
It’s a tool Used by firefighters
We can’t start specific

Weber makes a noncommittal noise and marks a check by some

words

Ian reveals to Louise his sketch of an ALIEN

IAN
Heptapod Seven arms
(re list)
Make sure the numbers one through
ten are on your list I want to ask
them some basic math problems

LOUISE
First things first

IAN
Yes That would be my numbers

Louise confronts Ian

LOUISE
Tell me how a math problem can ask
our heptapod friends what their
purpose is on Earth

Ian takes the bait
IAN
It would be a complex algebraic
proof but it’s feasible

LOUISE
Simple beats complex

Weber hands her the revised list

COLONEL WEBER
Here You can use everything on the
list but I’m adding one

Louise looks down at the page We don’t see what it is

LOUISE
That’s dangerous We could come off
as hostile

COLONEL WEBER
Then choose your demonstration
carefully

Lt Marks enters the tent

LT MARKS
They’re back

All eyes go to the bank of monitors showing the convex part
of the massive sphere where the circular portals align to
form the tunnel

Like a Spirogram of negative space the round holes line up
from different directions and light from deep within the
space craft spills out

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER - MORNING

Louise faces the transparent wall holding a dry-erase marker
in one hand Ian stands near the whiteboard Everyone is in
full HAZMAT suits again

Weber is suspiciously absent
The heptapods watch Louise with a strange curiosity
Louise points at herself

LOUISE
Louise

The whiteboard displays her name in large letters
Beat One heptapod speaks Whisper-flutter-click

On its side of the room beyond the glass the heptapod
approaches its console It draws something hidden from view
A beautiful LOGOGRAM appears on the glass

cr

IAN
Well that’s progress

LOUISE
No That’s the symbol for “human”
again But with a little curl at
the end of that leg Probably to
indicate a question

IAN
They’re getting confused

LOUISE
You know what-- I can’t do it like
this I just--

Louise takes her HAZMAT mask off

IAN
Whoa whoa hey--

Weber’s voice pipes in via intercom from the ops tent

COLONEL WEBER (VO)
You’re risking contamination

LOUISE
They need to see me

Louise shirks out of the rest of her suit She’s wearing her
civilian clothes underneath

The heptapods advance a step closer to the barrier Curious

Everyone holds their breath a beat Slowly Louise puts a
hand on her heart and repeats

LOUISE (CONTD)
My name is Louise

She takes the whiteboard and writes furiously

Flips it around and shows She’s drawn their symbol for
“human” next to the English word “HUMAN” and then a greater-
than symbol leading to her name

The two heptapods confer with one another

LOUISE (CONTD)
Ian introduce yourself

Ian erases Louise’s name on the board and writes his
He steps forward and shows it to them

IAN
Ian My name is Ian

He points at it when he says it

A magical thing happens next The two aliens work at their
console which is set at an angle preventing Louise from
seeing them write

The shorter rounder heptapod steps forward Click-tone A
small logogram appears on the boundary in front of him

Then the taller one ambles close Flutter-swallow A
different symbol appears in front of him

Louise grins

LOUISE
They have names

IAN
Yeah So what do we call them
Because if I try to make sounds
like them I will end up insulting
their mothers

LOUISE
How about Slim and Stout

IAN
I was thinking Abbott and Costello

Weber’s voice crackles in their ears

COLONEL WEBER (VO)
Forty minutes remaining

Louise cracks her knuckles with her thumb
LOUISE

All right Let’s learn some

heptapod
Ian noisily shirks off his HAZMAT suit to join Louise
SERIES OF SHOTS
1) Louise shows the word “WALK” and Ian demonstrates
2) Costello saunters along his side of the wall anda

heptapod logogram appears It’s simple yet complex like a
fractal in line art

scrawled on the board

4) Ian points to three apples on a table Louise writes the
numeral “3” next to the numeral “2” and the new words she’s
added between them “MORE THAN”

3) Ian eats an apple The words “APPLE” paired with “EAT” are

5) The numerals 3 2 shine on the transparent wall along
with its heptapod logogram
INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER - LATER

Lt Marks remains in the room in full HAZMAT suit monitoring
the equipment sidearm at his belt

LT MARKS
That’s time

LOUISE
I’m just halfway down my list

Abbott speaks Water-crashing-basstone
A logogram appears

IAN
What’s that Goodbye

LOUISE
(surprised)
No

Underneath the logogram the English word (copied in writing
style from Louise’s board) appears “MORE”

LOUISE (CONTD)
I think they want to keep going

HANNAH (VO)
(pre-lap)
Another one

That high pitch like Tinnitus bleeds into the sound and--

INT HANNAH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Six-year-old HANNAH sits up in bed in her pajamas
Louise sits next to her closing a story book

LOUISE
You are just insatiable

HANNAH
Yes I am What’s that mean

LOUISE
It means you’ll never get tired of
stories
HANNAH

Well duh then I would be boring
LOUISE

One more then bedtime
HANNAH

The Giving Tree
LOUISE

I read that one to you last night
HANNAH

Yeah yeah
LOUISE

Why hear it again
Little Hannah smiles sweetly up at Louise

HANNAH
It’s just as good the second time

Her words seem to have a profound impact on Louise

LOUISE
Yes It is isn’t it

The high pitch tone emerges as

IAN (VO)
Are we good

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER - EVENING

Back to scene
Louise looks abruptly distracted Confused

IAN
Colonel Weber got his word in
Let’s just move on to something
else now okay

Louise is holding a HUNTING KNIFE in her hands
On the transparent wall facing her the heptapods have

written a terse angular symbol and put the English
translation under it “WEAPON”

Louise consults her list getting back in the moment

LOUISE
Yeah Okay

COLONEL WEBER (VO)
(through speakers)
Get me answers Doctor Banks Stop
teaching and start asking

LOUISE
We first need to distinguish a
weapon from other kinds of devices
or else they’1l1 think everything is
a weapon

Costello whisper-clicks at Abbott then turns to leave A
doorway irises open on the far wall

Abbott wipes the console and the logogram vanishes

LT MARKS
They’re leaving

LOUISE
Wait Wait

She steps to the boundary and puts her hand on it
Abbott pauses

LOUISE (CONTD)
Why are you here

Abbott crooks his head

Louise desperate looks back at the printer attached to the
still camera capturing everything written by the heptapods

She riffles through the pages looking for the words

IAN
What can I do

Louise gives him two print-outs

LOUISE
Hold these up

Abbott looks back at the door where Costello left Then at
Louise and Ian

Louise finishes drawing Shows the board to Abbott Puts it
against the boundary She’s attempted freehand drawing their
gorgeous logograms and she’s actually done a great job

LOUISE (CONTD)
Why are the heptapods on Earth

It’s not quite the phrasing she hasn’t taught them “why” but
instead uses “heptapods purpose Earth” with a curl on the
logogram for Earth

Abbott stares a beat
And writes on the console

To reciprocate Louise’s choice of heptapod writing Abbott
answers in English with two words

“OFFER WEAPON”

Louise steps back from the boundary
The phrase sends a tense hush through the team

Abbott turns and exits

The unidentifiable light source in the interview chamber dims
and the transparent wall clouds until it’s fully opaque

Louise Ian Lt Marks and the other in-room Camera Techs
face each other as if they’ve just learned a terrible secret

INT OPERATIONS TENT - NIGHT

An eruption of sound and chaos joining in mid-debate with
several people talking at once

LT MARKS
But you saw what they wrote--

IAN
--using a word they don’t fully
understand

LOUISE
(to Weber)
And they could just as well be
asking us to give them a weapon as
a request--

COLONEL WEBER
That wasn’t a request

Weber steps up to the giant white board surrounded by flat
screens More data has been collected by spy satellite about
the other alien sites

A new label has appeared on two locations “BLACKOUT”
Nearby Halpern is on the phone

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
An hour ago a black cloud appeared
directly over the Russian site
followed by a similar anomaly in
Peru DARPA has something like it
so odds are it’s man-made to throw
a blanket over the whole site
Weve lost eyes and ears Last
transmission from our spy in Peru
said he heard gunfire

IAN
Who’s attacking whom

COLONEL WEBER
We don’t know But I’m not taking
any chances You’re both confined
to base until further notice

Those words trigger a reaction with Louise
The telltale pitch rises quickly and in a flash--

INT LOUISE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Hannah now age 11 is having a fit in front of Louise who
stands with her arms crossed

HANNAH
I’m grounded Are you kidding me
Are you kidding me

LOUISE
We had a deal You do your chores
or you don’t get to sleep over at
Rileys

HANNAH
I said I’d do it when I got home

LOUISE
Saying it doesn’t make it true

HANNAH
Mom seriously

LOUISE
I am serious young woman

HANNAH
I’m gonna miss the movie if I have
to stay and vacuum and the movie is
what bonds everyone the rest of the
night

(MORE)

HANNAH (CONTD)
Like they’1l be quoting from it and
I won’t know the context and
Stephanie will use it as a wedge to
separate me from the other girls

Louise can’t keep a straight face Hannah is just too
precocious Stifling a snicker

LOUISE
Miss the movie or miss the whole
night Your choice

HANNAH
Ugh I swear you had me just so
you could get free child labor
When do I get to live my own life
That’s all I ask

Hannah stomps off leaving Louise shaking her head

A door SLAMS which jolts Louise in surprise and--

INT OPERATIONS TENT - NIGHT
Present day Louise stumbles nearly falls Ian catches her

IAN
Whoa You okay

Louise holds onto the edge of a table recovering from a
sudden vertigo She focuses on Ian

LOUISE
I I don’t know
(beat)
I guess the work is getting to me

Ian helps her upright where she faces a suspicious Weber
COLONEL WEBER
When was your last check-up with
Kettler
Louise lets out a weary breath No two ways about this now
she’s being sent to the doctor
INT DR KETTLER’S TRAILER - LATER
Louise sits in a plastic chair This isn’t a tent but a

sturdier facility with actual walls She watches Private
Lasky across from her in another little plastic chair

Lasky has his head bowed his hands clasped together His
knee bounces nervously He whispers under his breath
The door to Kettler’s office opens and Dr Kettler steps out
Lasky sits up whip-fast

DR KETTLER
Louise come in

Louise looks back at Lasky as she goes Lasky glares at her
DR KETTLER (VO)
(pre-lap)
How do you feel
INT DR KETTLER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A pen light shines in Louise’s left eye

LOUISE
Overworked

Kettler tries to be casual but comes off awkward
DR KETTLER
That makes two of us I hear you

collapsed in the ops tent

LOUISE
Probably just lack of sleep

Kettler readies a syringe
DR KETTLER

Well you’re not getting radiation
poisoning We’ll see how your blood
tests look but for now I’m going
to give you another boost Try and
sleep this one off okay

He sinks the needle into her arm

Louise winces

EXT BASE CAMP - NIGHT

The compound has doubled in size

EXT CIVILIAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

The sprawl of RVs campers trailers and cars parked outside
the barricade rivals the biggest Burning Man gathering

People gather around campfires sharing dinner

Others huddle in front of portable TVs watching the news
Two photographers take long-lens photos from their roof
And then there is a small group of young MEN at a picnic
table talking in low tones dining on canned foods

Hunting rifles and two handguns rest on the table
One of the young men is the ROTC STUDENT from the opener
INT BARRACKS - NIGHT

Louise wakes up on a cot in this darkened tent lined with
bunks It takes her a moment to get her bearings

That same RINGING in her ears is back She rolls over to face
the other side Ian sleeps in the cot next to hers

He lies on his side his blanket bunched up in front of him

Louise notices It’s just like she does with pillows

He stirs Wakes They make eye contact Ian whispers to her

IAN
Feeling better

LOUISE
Yeah
(beat)
I don’t know

IAN
I must admit I’m starting to see
the value of language

LOUISE
That’s what talking with aliens
will do

IAN

No It’s your approach to it
That’s what impressed me You steer
us around communication traps I
didn’t know existed Which probably
explains why I’m single

LOUISE
Oh believe me you can be the best
communicator in the world and still
wind up single

IAN
I find that hard to believe

Louise studies Ian’s face to see if he’s being sarcastic
He’s not This is honesty

LOUISE
My father worked for a big energy
company They’d relocate him every
year to some new country and I
went with him He used to say
learning all those foreign tongues
would make me the center of every
party But you know what people say
when you’re sixteen and fluent in
seven languages “You’re smart”

IAN
Oh no “Smart” is bad

LOUISE
People are so afraid of smart

IAN
No they don’t like it

LOUISE
Right about now you’re usually
outside staring at the ship
What are you looking for

IAN

When I was six my parents bought
me a globe One of those big ones
on an iron floor stand This was
the same year I dressed up as a
wilderness explorer for Halloween
My room was papered with hand-drawn
maps of my neighborhood

(beat)
I studied every inch of that globe
and it was the saddest moment of my
childhood It had all been explored
already Claimed named and
labeled top to bottom My whole
purpose in life taken away

(beat)
Next Halloween I was an astronaut

LOUISE
“To boldly go where no one has gone
before”
IAN
And is that too much to ask
(sigh)

I’ve spent the last thirty years
staring at the sky Trying to find
a way out there Now it’s here and
I don’t know how I feel about it

LOUISE
Because you might finally get to
explore the galaxy

IAN
Because the heptapods may have
already explored it

Ian chuckles Louise smiles at him
It’s nearly a touching moment Then

A siren blares from somewhere outside Stadium lighting
claps on from beyond the barracks tent casting shadows
against the tent’s walls

Ian and Louise sit up

EXT BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Wearing coats over their pajamasnightgowns Ian and Louise
step out of their tent--

And hear a new sound underneath the siren A low constant
THRUM like a subwoofer emanating from the earth

Soldiers run past with assault rifles

Ian and Louise follow toward the clearing

To discover that the massive sphere is SPINNING in place ona
strange axis Bits of dirt grass and leaves show the speed
and angle of its rotation

The Soldiers stand at the ready not sure what to expect

Just as quickly as it began the spinning stops
The THRUM dies down

Someone cuts off the base camp’s siren and it’s suddenly
quiet save for the sound of the wind

LOUISE
What was that

IAN
--I don’t know

Pushing in slowly on the heptapod ship

AGENT HALPERN (VO)

(pre-lap)
Youve had plenty of time to figure
it out

INT HOTEL SUITE - MORNING

Colonel Weber stands with rigid posture at a small table in
the living space of this no-frills hotel room

Agent Halpern is seated around a breakfast spread with two
other men GENERAL STAHL (late 50s) and Chief of Staff ERNIE
BLACK (late 30s) Stahl is dressed in his stars and bars
Black wears civilian clothes

AGENT HALPERN
Weve been playing this your way
but all your civilian team has
managed so far is to teach the
aliens grade-school English

COLONEL WEBER
That’s right

GENERAL STAHL
You’re proud of that

COLONEL WEBER
It’s bridge building general It’s
the only way to get the answers
we’re all eager to hear

ERNIE BANKS
The President isn’t so sure He’s
concerned that we’re making our
sessions a classroom while other
countries have a trading post

COLONEL WEBER
You can’t trade without
establishing a dialogue first
GENERAL STAHL
Explorers did it You think any of
them took time to teach the Indians
Spanish

AGENT HALPERN
It’s also possible that the other
countries are benefitting from all
our hard work If these aliens are
networked at all we’re teaching
all of them English so they can
communicate easier with everyone

COLONEL WEBER
But even then we’re ahead of the
rest of the world because only we
know what we’ve taught the aliens

ERNIE BANKS
And it’s enough to start asking the
big questions The people in that
room shape the discussion You
brought in academics It’s time we
bring in the big boys

COLONEL WEBER
Who-- Halpern’s CIA spooks I was
guaranteed another week with Banks
and Donnelly

AGENT HALPERN
That was before we got this intel

Halpern drops a file folder on Weber’s end of the table

INT BARRACKS - MORNING
Louise wakes up in her cot
Across from her Ian’s cot is empty

PRIVATE COMBS (0S)
Doctor Banks

She’s startled and looks at the foot of her cot--
Where PRIVATE COMBS stands Sidearm at his hip

LOUISE
Yes

PRIVATE COMBS
Sorry for waking you ma’am I’ve
been assigned to escort you around
base camp and into the shell
Colonel Weber’s orders

LOUISE
Did something happen

PRIVATE COMBS
No ma’am It’s just to make sure
were ready when it does

LOUISE
If it does

PRIVATE COMBS
--Yes ma’am

LOUISE
Where is Ian

PRIVATE COMBS
Waiting for you outside the shell

EXT BASE CAMP - MORNING
Louise and Combs approach the ship The portal is open

At the entrance Ian waits with FOUR GREEN BERETS He seems
relieved to see her coming

A second SQUAD OF SOLDIERS is building a heavily-armored
bunker facing the ship a hundred feet away

Nestled in the field under the shadow of the tree line
THREE Ml ABRAMS TANKS sit quietly turrets pointed in the
general direction of the ship

Beyond The sound of helicopters And carried in the wind
distant car horns and a great rabble of voices far off

LOUISE
What is that noise

PRIVATE COMBS
People at the blockade Trying to
get in We had two sneak in last
night Patrol caught them half a
click from base camp

LOUISE
Reporters
PRIVATE COMBS
No ma’am

LOUISE
What happened to them

No answer Louise arrives and finds Lt Marks with Ian

LOUISE (CONTD)
What is going on

LT MARKS

Security measures Latest intel

from two other sites hints at an
escalation in the negotiations

IAN
Escalation What does that mean

LT MARKS
It means you get a security detail

LOUISE
Well this is a cute little allegory
for the Cold War isn’t it

LT MARKS
They’re going in with you

LOUISE
If they go in I stay out

LT MARKS
They aren’t here to start a fight

LOUISE

How will the heptapods know that
It could look like a hit squad to
them This is how wars start Do

you get that

Louise pushes past Lt Marks and heads for the door
Ian follows her

The four Green Berets glance at Lt Marks questioningly
follow inside Ian stops them with an open hand

IAN
Well call you if we need you

then

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS

Louise Ian and Lt Marks enter to find Abbott and Costello
waiting on the other side of the transparent wall

New to the heptapod side of the room FOUR TURRETS mounted on
the floor lined up just on the other side of the barrier
Seven snub-nosed barrels extend from a bulbous top
suggesting omnidirectional firing

Everyone sees them This doesn’t look good

LOUISE
Maybe they’re cameras

IAN
Exactly four Same as the number of
soldiers outside

Louise looks back at Lt Marks who studies the new turrets
with a cold calculating gaze

The portal remains open It doesn’t close behind them now

LOUISE
At least they’re leaving the door
open this time That’s a good sign
(beat)
Isn’t it

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER - MORNING

The four Green Berets stand inside the room Watchful
Lt Marks stands at the entry to the chamber like a bouncer

Louise’s whiteboard has been replaced with a large flatscreen
TV and attached digital drawing tablet

Ian has a screen of his own too and it displays the
Pythagorean theorem As well as an animation of an
equilateral triangle He’s been introducing math

Ian says into a camera

IAN
Session number eight Geometric
equations and the concept of
intent which will allow us to use
the word “why”

LT MARKS
Ask about the weapon

Ian glances at Louise

IAN
Right

Abbott and Costello approach the transparent boundary
MOMENTS LATER

The sentences on the flatscreen read “Why does Ian give
Louise an apple Because Louise is hungry”

The written logogram is displayed A gorgeous interwoven
circle of loops whorls and symbols

IAN (CONTD)
What is that

LOUISE
I think it’s what we wrote
(pointing)
Look This is the word for “apple”
but it’s conjoined with their
names I can’t tell where it
starts or ends

IAN
No front or back Like their
bodies And the ship

LOUISE
How do you begin to craft a complex
statement like this The relation
each symbol has to another

IAN
Maybe they’re cheating

Said more as a joke But it gives Louise an idea

LOUISE
We’ve never seen them write Only
the result Let’s see them in the
act of writing

Louise returns to the tablet Erases the sentence on her
screen And then instead of preparing words and displaying
the result she triggers the “live sketching” option that
shows her writing the letters and words in real-time

She writes the sentence “Louise writes so heptapods can see
her writing”

Abbott and Costello crook their heads
Costello adjusts something on his console

Then Abbott removes TWO DEVICES like glowing orbs and

approaches the transparent boundary

Lt Marks notices Tenses Snaps his fingers
The Green Berets step forward

LT MARKS
What does he have

LOUISE
Calm down Calm

LT MARKS

(into mic)
One of them is approaching the
boundary

Abbott reaches the boundary and holds up the orbs in two of
his seven hands He places them at two points on the

transparent wall and begins to draw

Abbott writes a heptapod sentence in real-time With two

hands simultaneously

It is poetry in motion A dance of light He begins the
sentence at opposite ends and then writes phrases and
symbols in a perfect pair of arcs so that they connect as a

circle at the end

LOUISE
Oh my god Nonlinear orthography

IAN
Wait what did you say

COLONEL WEBER (VO)
(over intercom)
Doctor Banks outside

She looks over at Ian Am I in trouble

Ian shrugs I don’t know

EXT SPACE SHIP - MORNING

Moving with Louise Weber and SERGEANT ENGEL (30s
They walk away from the sphere
Behind them the portal remains open

COLONEL WEBER
Explain What did they write

gruff)

LOUISE
It’s not what but how What we
just saw was a kind of magic trick

She shows him a photo of the circular heptapod phrasing

LOUISE (CONTD)

He starts at two opposite points
and completes the sentence by
joining them into a kind of loop
But to do this means he has to have
the whole thing in his head before
he begins Every detail The
spacing has to be right or else you
wind up with fragments a mess

(beat)
It’s more impressive than that He
wrote the mirror image of it It’s
reversed so we can read it

COLONEL WEBER
So They’re good at writing

LOUISE
That’s a result of the way they
think It’s like they know
everything they’re going to say
before they say it

Weber opens the file folder he got from Halpern

COLONEL WEBER
Do you know who this man is

He shows Louise a photo

THE PHOTO Grainy surveillance snapshot of a SLENDER ASIAN
MAN in a nice but slightly too-big business suit surrounded
by a throng of armed SOLDIERS escorted into a building

LOUISE
No Who is he

COLONEL WEBER
Yoshi Takamura Japan’s most
prominent engineer Invented a
seismic retrofit system that lets a
skyscraper withstand earthquakes
twice as big as 2011

LOUISE
And I take it he’s being escorted
onto the Hokkaido site So
COLONEL WEBER
You want to know why we don’t have
any engineers on our team yet

LOUISE
Why

COLONEL WEBER
Because we don’t have any goddamn
alien weapon to build

Louise gets it now

LOUISE
You think they got something from
the heptapods

COLONEL WEBER
I know they do Two hours after
this was taken they shipped in--

Snaps his fingers at Engel “Remind me--”

SGT ENGEL
Four trucks--

COLONEL WEBER
--four trucks of equipment from a
nearby industrial plant

SGT ENGEL
And a titanium housing from Kyoto

COLONEL WEBER
Were losing this race If you and
Ian don’t get me results in the
next 48 hours I’m bringing in
someone to replace you

LOUISE
There aren’t any shortcuts here
Colonel

COLONEL WEBER
Not with your methods no

Louise sees the worry in Weber’s eyes

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

Louise somberly walks back in

Ian stands near the boundary where Costello diagrams an
equilateral triangle with two hands in real-time

IAN
Yes very pretty Look at you go
But I asked you to solve it not
just copy my work

LOUISE
Weber gave us an ultimatum We get
whatever it is they’re here to give
us in two days or they’re going to
do something stupid

IAN
C’mere

Louise gets closer He puts an arm on her shoulder and
continues facing Abbott

IAN (CONTD)
(sotto)
Weber showed me a metal composite
two days ago asked me to calculate
the force required to break it

LOUISE
(sotto)
What kind of metal

IAN
(sotto)
My guess The ship’s hull
(off her look)
I didn’t help them

Louise looks woefully at the heptapods on the other side
LOUISE
(sotto)
No doubt they found someone who
did

With new resolve Louise grabs a keyboard synced to the large
flatscreen and types as she speaks

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Give weapon to us now

Costello goes to the console Draws
An intertwined looping series of logograms appears

Ian looks at it more closely

IAN
Is that the symbol for my name
Costello then draws some more
The same phrase appears underneath in (clunky) English
“LOUISE IAN NOT READY”

LOUISE
Not ready Ready how When

Realizing they still don’t comprehend each other’s spoken
language Louise begins drawing the question in the
heptapod’s written logograms

Ian watches her draw
IAN
You don’t use both hands but I must
say you’re really getting the hang
of their language

The result appears on their screen and Ian’s right It’s
almost as good as what Abbott or Costello draws

Beat
Abbott and Costello confer Whisper-gurgle-click

The transparent boundary clears itself of all its writing
Abbott approaches it with the two glowing pen-orbs Sets them
as far apart as he can reach then draws two lines that meet

in the middle to form one long contiguous line

Abbott then caps off the line with taller end-marks

Abbott gestures at the line chart and speaks Click-click
LOUISE
Humanity That’s their spoken word
for humans

IAN
How do you know

LOUISE
I remember how it sounds

Finally he places a dot at the far right end of the line

The result looks like o—

Above it a label that looks the same forward or backward a
terse little logogram with pluralization curls Symmetrical

IAN
I’ve seen that one before

LOUISE
Session four When I was trying to
describe the difference between
“now” and “later” They used that
to represent “now”

IAN
So we’re right there

LOUISE
At the end of our timeline

Costello then writes via the console and one English word
appears above it all “SOLVE”

IAN
Son of a bitch
(beat)
He’s giving us homework

Louise frowns

INT HANNAH’S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Hannah age 8 sits on her bed her arms crossed
Pouting Grumping

Louise peeks in on her way past

LOUISE
What’s with the grouch face

HANNAH
I learned a terrible new word
today

LOUISE
From your father

HANNAH
From my teacher

LOUISE

(wait what)
Oh Which word is that You can
tell me

HANNAH
(disgusted)
“Homework”

Louise laughs

HANNAH (CONTD)
It’s not funny School has most of
my day already That’s why they
call it school They can’t make
demands like this It’s illegal
Isn’t it

LOUISE
Sadly no

HANNAH
Well it should be

LOUISE
Oh honey I’m going to tell you
something

(getting close)
No one can make you do anything
But you have to think about the
consequences Okay If you show up
tomorrow and everyone else has done
their homework but you how do you
think they’1ll feel

Hannah sighs

EXT STARFIELD IN SKY - NIGHT

Time-lapse sequence The heavens move like a canopy

INT MESS TENT - NIGHT
Louise eats alone

Private Lasky eats his dinner two tables over The rest of
the dining area is empty

Louise steals a glance at the Private

Lasky is staring at her
She nods at him
PRIVATE LASKY

You’re the lady who talks to the
aliens

LOUISE
That’s me

PRIVATE LASKY
Let me ask you Are you scared

LOUISE
Scared of what

PRIVATE LASKY
That they’1l do something to
you Like they’re already doing
something

Louise is unsettled by his tone

LOUISE
They’re not the type

PRIVATE LASKY
I saw you in Doctor Kettler’s
office

LOUISE
That was for something else

Lasky shakes his head he doesn’t believe her
Ian enters looking worse for wear

He grabs a pre-made meal at the counter and joins Louise at
her table His eyes are bloodshot

LOUISE (CONTD)
I didn’t expect to see you out

IAN
I’m hiding from Weber He’s got me
working on that damn timeline every
waking minute

LOUISE
Any new ideas

IAN
It’s a timeline I don’t know what
they’re asking me to solve Bayes’
Theorem applied to global
population

LOUISE
Just a reminder I flunked
calculus I have no clue what
youre talking about

Ian grabs a salt shaker from the end of the table

IAN
Okay

He pours a dollop of salt on the table between them A few
quick shakes

IAN (CONTD)
The current world population is
hovering close to eight billion

He then starts another pile of salt a few inches from the
first one Shakes quite a lot here

IAN (CONTD)
This group here represents the
cumulative population of the whole
history of humanity Estimates put
this at just over 100 billion

Ian puts the shaker down and points at the small pile

IAN (CONTD)
What that means is About eight
percent of every human who ever
lived is alive right now

This sends a chill through Louise

LOUISE
That much Really

IAN
If we were cancer cells and the
Earth was a patient the doctor
would tell her she’s dead In fact
if you mapped this out in a graph
to predict when humanity would die
off you get this

Ian spreads out the salt like sand and runs his finger
through it in a line punctuating one end

The result looks like o—

LOUISE
They’re warning us We’re about to
die off

Ian leans close
This hits

IAN
But I can’t tell that to Weber
He’d see it as an alien threat

LOUISE
Doesn’t it scare you to lie to
command like that

IAN
What scares me is being remembered
as the guy responsible for getting
a bunch of people killed or worse

home with Louise

LOUISE
That’s a very real fear

IAN
The heptapods are asking for a
solve How do you solve this By
all counts we can last maybe
another fifty years on this planet
before we all die off

LOUISE
Youll find a way

She’s sincere

Ian smiles at her

Louise suddenly winces and rubs her temples

IAN
How are you holding up

LOUISE
Headaches

IAN
Stress

LOUISE
Maybe
(beat)
My brain is scrambled

IAN
What I like to do to reset my brain
is make some gourmet macaroni and
cheese pop open a bottle of beer
and watch “The Thin Man”

Louise looks at him differently now

LOUISE
You just read me like a book

IAN
If we ever get out of here Id
like to make you dinner

Louise brightens Can’t help but grin

Colonel Weber enters the mess tent and sets his sights on
Ian Calls out from the door

COLONEL WEBER
Ian You’re needed in operations

Ian keeps his focus on Louise

She reaches out to him and holds onto the back of his hand
For a moment they’d forgotten about the current situation
Now reality is crashing back in

IAN
I’1l see you back at housing
tonight

Ian gets up and leaves

When he’s gone Louise’s headache returns Her smile fades
That weird ringing starts in She mutters to herself

LOUISE
(sotto)
It’s all right It’s all right

INT LOUISE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Louise sits on the couch nursing a beer Watching TV Short
hair looking exhausted

On the TV William Powell and Myrna Loy playing Nick and
Nora Charles from THE THIN MAN

NICK CHARLES
(on TV)
It’s all right Joe It’s all
right It’s my dog And uh my
wife

NORA CHARLES
(on TV)
Well you might have mentioned me
first on the billing
Louise says the line as Myrna does
Hannah age 10 enters and assesses the situation

HANNAH
Oh no

LOUISE
Come join me

HANNAH
I make it a point not to attend
pity parties

LOUISE
This isn’t about me losing the
grant to Danvers

HANNAH
Mom I’m going to level with you

LOUISE
Oh here it comes

HANNAH

I’ve got you figured out Everyone
thinks you’re this ball-buster who
does nothing but work

LOUISE
Ha

HANNAH
I’ve seen people’s faces when you
introduce me as your daughter
“When did this woman make time to
have a kid”

LOUISE
I’m such a monster

HANNAH
That’s what you want them to think
The truth is your heart is too
big You love too much You want
the world to be a better place

LOUISE
Nice try kiddo

Hannah comes over and hugs Louise tightly

Louise hugs back surprised

HANNAH
We need more people like you mom

Hannah doesn’t let go
Beat The wall inside Louise breaks She starts to cry

Hannah keeps holding on

EXT BASE CAMP HOUSING PRE-FABS - NIGHT
Louise falters on her way back to the housing pre-fab
She notices tears in her eyes Wipes them

LOUISE
(sotto)
Ah hell

PRIVATE COMBS (0S)
Ma’ am

Louise is startled at the voice

Private Combs stands a few feet away rifle slung over his
shoulder Her escort

PRIVATE COMBS (CONT’D)
You okay

LOUISE
Yes I just What time is it

PRIVATE COMBS
Twenty-one hundred Need to get you
inside before curfew

LOUISE
Right
(then)
Curfew

PRIVATE COMBS
Because of the barricade Too many
civilians trying to get in

Louise looks out at the tree line Half a mile out stadium
lights illuminate the forest

PRIVATE COMBS (CONT’D)
Patrol caught another group two
nights ago

LOUISE
They want to see the aliens

PRIVATE COMBS
No ma’am They wanna kill them

LOUISE
Why

PRIVATE COMBS
Most believe this is end times

Louise doesn’t respond But it worries her

She approaches a small pre-fab structure This is where she’s
been moved Private Combs stands guard outside

INT HOUSING PRE-FAB - MOMENTS LATER

Inside it’s not much bigger than a studio apartment

Louise takes two steps into the combination living area and
bedroom and freezes

Dr Kettler sits at her small study desk with a book wearing
a pair of reading glasses

Colonel Weber stands in the middle of the room with his hands
behind his back

DR KETTLER
Good evening Louise

LOUISE
Dr Kettler Colonel What are you
two doing here

COLONEL WEBER
(gestures)
Why don’t you sit down

Louise cautiously approaches and sits on the small couch
opposite him

DR KETTLER
How are you feeling

LOUISE
I just need sleep I’m fine

Weber makes a noise Louise glances at him

COLONEL WEBER
Don’t be dismissive The doc is
just trying to help

LOUISE
Help me with what

DR KETTLER
The headaches One moment you’re
here the next you’re staring off

COLONEL WEBER
And the last two sessions you
haven’t referred to the heptapod
dictionary You’re reading it as
they write it

LOUISE
You’ve been monitoring me

DR KETTLER
I’m your doctor

LOUISE
Youre the military doctor

DR KETTLER
All this focus on alien language
It’s got to be affecting you

Louise lets out a breath

LOUISE
You heard of the Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis The idea is you
immerse yourself in a foreign
dialect enough you start to dream
in it It re-wires your brain

DR KETTLER
Fascinating
(then)
Are you dreaming in this language
He holds up a piece of paper
It says “GIVE WEAPON” in her handwriting

Louise blinks

The paper now has a heptapod LOGOGRAM It’s not in English
It never was in English

LOUISE
I I guess so Yes

COLONEL WEBER
All right Time to give you a
little break
Beat This throws Louise
LOUISE
I need to keep translating This

work is too important to stop

Kettler stands up taking Louise’s book with him
Weber starts for the door

COLONEL WEBER
Well call you if we need you

LOUISE
Who’s going to talk to them

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER - MORNING

Standing before Abbott and Costello is Ian Behind him stands

Lt Marks with his squad of GREEN BERETS
A new device has been rolled into the room A TRANSLATOR

It’s been programmed with all the information Louise has
learned from the heptapods

Ian glances over at where Louise normally stands He
reluctantly leans forward and speaks into a microphone

IAN
Hello again Ready to do some math

He looks over at the device which whirs

A second later the heptapod LOGOGRAMS for what Ian just
appears on the screen

Beyond the transparent wall Abbott and Costello stand
stoically Watchful Unmoving

LT MARKS
(into mic)
Give us the weapon

The heptapods crook their heads at Lt Marks

Ian looks back at Marks with a sudden dread

said

IAN
Let me handle this
LT MARKS
You have ten minutes Prove you can
work faster than Louise Banks
EXT BASE CAMP - MORNING
Louise marches for the sphere

As she approaches the portal two GREEN BERETS from Lt
Marks’s group stop her

LOUISE
Who’s in there now

GREEN BERET
Ma’ am-—

At that moment Ian steps out of the tunnel
Louise sees him

He makes eye contact with her

And her heart breaks A personal betrayal

IAN
Louise

LOUISE
You son of a bitch

She storms off for the operations tent
He jogs to try and catch up to her

IAN
This wasn’t my idea They built a
translator device from your work I
had to make sure they didn’t-- Hey

INT OPERATIONS TENT - MORNING

Louise pushes through the tent flap and zeroes in on Colonel
Weber standing by the massive white board with the columns
of other nations with alien sites

EVERY SINGLE TV SCREEN is filled with footage of violence
Gunfire at the grounds of another alien site Riots at
another Naval warfare on the Indian Ocean

On the white board seven of the eleven countries now have
the word “BLACKOUT” written next to them

In another corner of the Ops Tent a group of PHYSICISTS
gathered at a glass drawing board displaying the timeline

Surrounding the timeline in other colored markers are various
physics equations and properties

Ian comes in after Louise and sees her staring down Weber
LOUISE
You put a piece of tech in the room
instead of me
Weber hangs up his phone
IAN
It doesn’t really work I’1ll have
better luck with my table of props

explaining mass and volume

COLONEL WEBER
Why aren’t you in there now

LOUISE
I should be in there

Weber dismisses Ian with a gesture and focuses on Louise

COLONEL WEBER
I need you on another project now

LOUISE
What’s more important than working
with the heptapods

Weber picks up a remote and points it at a TV

COLONEL WEBER
You fluent in Mandarin

LOUISE
Yes why

He hands Louise a set of headphones and replays a video
Louise watches the screen headphones over her ears

ON SCREEN Footage of two CHINESE MEN meeting at a camp not
unlike the Montana site The camera capturing this footage is

hidden and far from the two men zoomed in

Muddled voices speak in Mandarin Louise translates
LOUISE (CONTD)

He’s saying each of the twelve is
offering advanced technology

(beat)
Their spies report none of the tech
appears to be the same

(beat)
Something about gaining an
advantage No one can be trusted

She meets Weber’s gaze at this last bit
The clip ends abruptly Weber takes the headphones back

COLONEL WEBER
Were getting a lot of activity at
a Sichuan site rumored to hold a
few nuclear warheads China may be
bringing a nuke to their alien
visitors To trade or to detonate
either way it’s bad news for us

LOUISE
What about their translators

COLONEL WEBER
We still have a few operatives on
the ground and far as we can tell
you’re the only one who’s cracked
the language Our foreign
counterparts have reverted to the
old days of bartering Or worse

Lt Marks enters riled up Steps up to Weber

LT MARKS
May I have a word Colonel

Weber nods to Louise Dismissed
LOUISE
We’re not done here I want back
in I’m fit
COLONEL WEBER
Get Doctor Kettler to sign off on
it and we’1l talk

LT MARKS
Sir

Weber and Marks turn their backs on her

She scowls and breaks off to see Ian

AT IANS STATION he idly puts physics toy models in a box as
he watches the team of Physicists who’ve taken over his job

LOUISE
You went in without me You let
them push me off the team

IAN
I didn’t have a choice And by the
way they did the same with me
(pointing)
Weber brought in a room full of
monkeys to try and crack the
timeline I’m off the job

The Physicists see him glaring at them One of them takes the
glass board and turns it so Ian and Louise are staring at the
backside all their writing is now backwards and harder to
read A sort of “screw you” gesture to Ian

Ian flips him off

LOUISE
I’m not going to just roll over
You don’t switch players this late
in the game It sends the wrong
signal

IAN
So it does

Louise follows his line of sight

Lt Marks and Weber are in the middle of a tense argument
We’re too far away to hear it

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
There’s gotta be a way for us to
get back in there

Louise’s attention drifts back to the glass drawing board
with the science team huddled at it

From her POV the timeline looks like this

—0

And the logogram over the dot that means ‘humanity’ looks the
same it’s an AMBIGRAM

Louise’s breath catches

LOUISE
Ian Look

He sees And stands up beside her Hit by epiphany

LOUISE (CONTD)
The word for ‘humanity’ is an
ambigram in their language It
reads the same front or back

IAN
That’s how the heptapods were
seeing it on their side To them
we are at the beginning of our
timeline

LOUISE
From their perspective humanity
has a long future ahead To us
were nearly done Which is it

IAN
It’s Schrodinger’s Cat It all
comes down to choice Louise --
weve solved it
He charges off toward Weber who’s overheard Ian

COLONEL WEBER
What kind of cat

Ian doesn’t go to Weber though He keeps striding right out
of the tent

LOUISE

Tan Ian wait--

EXT BASE CAMP - CONTINUOUS
Louise trails after Ian who’s headed right for the ship

The grassy field between the tent and the entry to the alien
ship is about a hundred yards

LOUISE
You aren’t going to tell Weber

IAN
Not yet Not until I confirm it
with Abbott and Costello
They’ve crossed maybe halfway to the portal

An army APC is parked near the ship PRIVATE LASKY unloads a
heavy bag Private Combs helps him carry it inside the ship

Louise frowns Noticing the two She’s becoming aware of her
surroundings as she talks with Ian

LOUISE
What do you mean about choice

Louise looks around for the Green Berets that usually guard
the tunnel entry

IAN
That’s what they’re saying The
human race is either about to die
off or we’re just getting warmed
up and it’s all about what choice
we make with the heptapods

The Green Berets are nowhere to be seen
Ian and Louise are now maybe ten yards from the ship
Private Combs exits the ship and marches right for them
LOUISE
(distracted)
What uh what choice do you
mean
IAN
(re Combs)
Who’s this guy

Private Combs gestures at the two of them Turn back

PRIVATE COMBS
The shell is off-limits

IAN
We need to see the aliens

PRIVATE COMBS
You just missed them

LOUISE
Well wait until they come back

PRIVATE COMBS
They aren’t coming back

Behind Combs Private Lasky runs out--
IN HIS HAND A remote detonator--

LOUISE
STOP HIM STOP--

A massive explosion rocks the scene and debris from inside
the interview chamber is blown outside like shrapnel--

Ian dives atop Louise as they go down covering her--
A loud RINGING in her ears--

Ian is shouting but we can’t hear him--

Private Combs gets up assault rifle in his hands--

Private Lasky joins him armed with an assault rifle of his
own just as the base camp SIREN starts wailing

WEBER and SERGEANT ENGEL burst out of the ops tent--
Louise starts to get up and out of Ian’s grasp--
Private Lasky raises his rifle to shoot at her--
Colonel Weber quick-draws and FIRES with his sidearm--

DROPPING Lasky a fraction of a second before getting a shot
at Louise his assault rifle firing wildly over her head--

Combs fires back at Weber and Engel--

Engel grabs Weber and the two hit the dirt while bullets
smack into the earth around them--

Combs retreats to the smoking portal of the ship--
Louise pursues Combs--

IAN
Louise

Louise reaches the entry and squints through the smoke--

SEEING a sudden glow from inside -- it silhouettes a stout
heptapod figure and a human one -- and as Combs raises his
rifle -- a great FLASH of light -- expanding like a tidal

wave in all directions --

The sound of a SCREAM just as -- the entry portal SEALS up
right before Louise can step inside Leaving her stumbling
back onto the lawn

Beat A sudden hush No one moving

Ian moves to Louise but stays down

The ear-ringing starts to fade and the sound of Weber barking
orders can be heard

COLONEL WEBER
Secure the area

IAN
Louise look at me Are you hurt

Louise shakes her head They start to get up
Then the alien ship begins to TURN Rotating at an oblique
angle yet remaining in place Like spinning a billiard ball

on its axis

The spherical craft reverses its hemispheres
Now it’s sitting upside-down from its previous position

Beat

A NEW PORTAL begins opening at ground level at the same
place as the previous portal It lines up perfectly with the
blackened grass from the explosion earlier

The space around the portal glows

Weber and Sgt Engel reach Ian and Louise grab them both
and pull them away from the ship As their sleeves go taut
from Weber and Engel pulling them--

INT “CLEAN ROOM” - MOMENTS LATER

--now the four are in the middle of a heated argument thirty
seconds later

LOUISE
We have to go in

COLONEL WEBER
That was an unprovoked attack--

LOUISE
By us Against the aliens

COLONEL WEBER
Even more reason not to walk in
there

IAN
Weber is right It’s too dangerous

LOUISE
You should be on my side

IAN
I am--

LOUISE
They opened another portal They’re
inviting us in because they want
answers The longer we wait-—-

COLONEL WEBER
Or they’re setting an ambush

LOUISE
That’s not like them

IAN
You don’t know Louise You don’t
have the data to support that
Examine this logically--

LOUISE
I’m not some equation for you to
solve and neither are they

IAN
I didn’t mean it like that--

But Louise storms out of the tent her emotions too raw right
now and too hurt by Ian’s perceived betrayal

Ian pursues with Weber behind them
COLONEL WEBER
Both of you get back here
EXT BASE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

Louise gets a dozen steps toward the new ship portal when Ian
catches her by the elbow

IAN
Louise-- wait

LOUISE
Don’t try and stop me

IAN
I wouldn’t dare But I’1l1 be damned
if you’re going in there alone

She sees he’s serious Not because he wants in But because
he wants to keep close to her

COLONEL WEBER
You don’t get to decide that I’m
responsible for you and I’m
telling you now you’re not going
inside without a formal invitation

Weber Louise and Ian are suddenly bathed in the glow of a
shimmering light

Their heads turn toward the ship to see
A SERIES OF LOGOGRAMS encircling the new portal

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
--What does that say

LOUISE
It’s my name And Ian’s And the
word for ‘enter’

She steps toward the ship Ian follows Weber doesn’t make a
move to stop them He just stares

INT NEW INTERVIEW CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

Louise and Ian step into this chamber that appears identical
to the previous one The floor and the ceiling are designed
as mirror images built to function in either direction

Costello stands at the console on his end
Louise and Ian have a similar console built in on their end

Costello draws on his and heptapod writing appears on the
transparent boundary between them

But this time an English voice speaks the translation for
them via some unseen broadcaster

MALE VOICE (VO)
Louise and Ian Answer question
Action with weapon against us
Question Why

Hearing a vocal version of English makes Louise gasp

LOUISE
That’s a simulation of your voice
Ian They have a spoken translator
working

Louise leans Ian against the console and then tries to figure
out how to use it

She finds the same glowing orbs she saw Abbott use in an
earlier session

A wide clean panel serves as a tablet surface
Louise begins to write

IAN
What are you going to tell him

LOUISE
That it wasn’t us

IAN
Pray he understands the concept of
terrorism

LOUISE
(sotto)
Actually I pray he doesn’t

As she draws the chamber’s translation voice works both
ways turning her words into whisper-clicks for Costello

She waits for Costello’s reaction

The transparent wall is cleared of the heptapod writing and
Costello begins drawing a new statement

MALE VOICE (VO)
Many weapons also tools make
purpose unclear

LOUISE
(as she writes)
Where is Abbott

Costello responds More heptapod writing appears
MALE VOICE (VO)
Abbott was in room Abbott was

waiting for Louise and Ian

Louise’s heart sinks Did the explosion kill one of the
heptapods Or is it wounded

IAN
You know maybe this was a bad
idea

LOUISE

Is Abbott dead
IAN
Wait you taught them about death
When did we cover that word

LOUISE
We didn’t Maybe someone else did
Eleven other countries are talking
to them

Costello writes more Louise watches the curved writing

appear on the wall

MALE VOICE (VO)
I am waiting for Louise and Ian
Solve

The timeline appears again
IAN
Choice Write what I told you That
both timelines are possible it all
depends upon what we choose to do
with their help
Louise nods
Her console panel goes dark
MALE VOICE (VO)
Write on here Write in our
language

Costello approaches the transparent boundary

Louise stares at the orbs in her hands
Looks up at Costello Thoughtful

IAN
What is it

LOUISE
It’s a complicated sentence I’m
trying to figure it out

IAN
You can do it

LOUISE
Shush

Louise approaches the boundary opposite Costello

She tentatively puts up two hands then lowers one

IAN
What

LOUISE
I can’t I can’t draw both ends at
the same time

She holds the orb in her right hand up against the glass

As she does Costello holds up one orb against the glass on
his end two feet to the left of her position

Louise regards him curiously
Costello speaks tone-gurgle

MALE VOICE (VO)
Solve

Weber enters back in his full HAZMAT suit with Sergeant
Engel carrying an advanced video camera with attachments

Engel points the camera at Louise and the heptapod

Louise takes a breath and begins to draw one end of this
elegant complicated circle of logograms

As she does Costello draws on his end Working in the
opposite arc toward Louise’s starting point

IAN
What is he doing

Louise’s eyes widen as she realizes

LOUISE
He’s being my other arm He’s
finishing my sentence

IAN
That’s impossible Not only would
he need to know what youre going
to write beforehand You would
have to know what he’s going to
write

The two co-authors finish simultaneously connecting the arcs
of their logograms into a circle

REVEAL an angle showing Costello’s hand perfectly aligned
with Louise’s only the transparent wall between them

QUICK POP Baby Hannah reaching up from her cradle her
little infant hand outstretched like Costello’s Louise
reaching down to let Hannah grip mom’s pointer finger

BACK TO SCENE Louise snaps out of that quick vision Shaken
She takes a step back

LOUISE
That’s That’s it

Looking at it head-on the logogram is complete

Now in the room Lt Marks as well

Costello backs away from the boundary

The writing disappears and the heptapod side of the chamber
grows dark

The boundary begins to glow

Then A tapestry of heptapod logograms begin flowing across
the entire transparent wall like wallpaper patterns

They flow downward a MATRIX screen of encrypted data too
much and coming too fast for Louise to decipher

Then mathematical information appears too Geometric data
It pours down the screen

COLONEL WEBER
What is that

LOUISE
I think it’s what they’ve been
waiting to give us
Closing in on the stream of information scrolling downward
like a waterfall
EXT STARFIELD IN SKY - NIGHT

Outside the canopy of stars above is staggering

Tilting down to find the Ops Tent

INT OPERATIONS TENT - NIGHT

Close in the data playing out on a large flatscreen

Ian Louise and the Physicists from earlier are parked at a
large table with small computer workspaces of their own each
working on a different section of the code

The new team members are still obviously nervous and excited
about being here DENNIS sits closest to Ian while
PETER and GREG compare notes opposite Louise

Ian orders around the guys who earlier today were brought
in to replace him

IAN
Weve got about eighty thousand
unique conjoined equations here
combined with the logograms Louise
is translating Tackle whatever you
can refer to me or Louise for
clarification We’ve been at this
for a few weeks

DENNIS
(raises hand)
Question

IAN
You don’t have to raise your hand
Dennis

DENNIS
Will we get to visit the aliens

IAN
Probably not

Weber steps in and answers that question

COLONEL WEBER
There’s no reason to talk to them
unless it’s to crack a piece of
this puzzle

LOUISE
I disagree
(off Weber’s look)
We should keep in regular contact
even if it’s just to say hello

COLONEL WEBER
This code is our priority

LOUISE
I want to keep talking to them

COLONEL WEBER
Keep up with your translation work
here and I’1l1 consider letting you
back in there
Weber turns and leaves discussion over

DENNIS
That guy sounds like my dad

IAN
He’s everybody’s dad

Louise rakes her fingers through her long hair
PETER (0S)
What’s this term here
INT LOUISE’S STUDY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Louise reads papers at her desk She runs her fingers through
her short hair like she just did

Her study is walled with books and her desk allows her a
view through the open door all the way down the hall

Hannah (age 10) steps to the threshold
Leans against the doorway

HANNAH
Mom

LOUISE
Sweetie

HANNAH

What’s the term for that thing
like a technical term where we
make like a deal and we both get
something out of it

LOUISE
A compromise

HANNAH
No

LOUISE

You remember what it sounds like

HANNAH
Like it’s a competition but both
sides end up happy

LOUISE
Like a win-win

HANNAH
More science-y than that

LOUISE
You want science call your father

Louise returns to her papers
Hannah frowns

HANNAH
You always do that You and Dad
both Put in just a little effort
and then kick me to the other
parent

LOUISE
Hannah that’s not fair

HANNAH
It really isn’t

She storms off down the hall
Louise watches her go Tries to think of what to say

IAN (V0O)
(pre-lap)
Louise--

INT OPERATIONS TENT - NIGHT

Louise snaps her head up having drifted off to sleep at her
work table surrounded by computers

IAN
Sorry

LOUISE
No I’m up
(then)
What day is it

IAN
I know right

LOUISE
I mean it I can’t remember when I
am anymore

IAN
I don’t know what day of the week
it is but it’s the day you see
what the heptapods have given us

He turns his monitor around to show her

A peculiar kind of JET ENGINE animation rendered 3D Particle
acceleration

IAN (CONTD)
Closest comparison would be cold
fusion

Louise doesn’t follow

IAN (CONTD)
What this process does it creates
a room-temperature nuclear reaction
in sexy little proportions through
a vacuum jacket and a skinny film
resistance heater pushing that
energy out the other end

LOUISE
What does that get us

IAN
Watch when I adjust the simulator
to run it at full power

Ian hits some keystrokes
The simulation seems to disappear in a flash of light

LOUISE
It went away

IAN
I thought the same thing Then I
ran the numbers again Best guess
it creates a cloaking field But
if I play with the numbers a bit I
think I can get us a new form of
air travel

LOUISE
Like how new

IAN
Like LA to New York in about nine
minutes

Louise catches her breath Ian brings her in close and hugs
her tightly Holds on

She melts and hugs back He’s breaking through to her

LOUISE
Do you know what this means It’s
not a weapon

IAN
Yeah

But then Ian’s face falls It could easily be turned into a
very dangerous weapon

IAN (CONTD)
Yeah

Dennis enters the tent and stops in his tracks
The two break off a bit embarrassed

LOUISE
(to Dennis)
Hey I just learned what you’ve
been designing

DENNIS
Yeah about that I’m at the tail
end of the code and Did you add
anything at the end

LOUISE
What do you mean

Dennis makes a few keystrokes on a monitor and brings up an
image on a large flat-screen

THE SCREEN shows a series of intertwined logograms Like a
Persian rug of alien data

Dennis magnifies one corner revealing
“1 12 -- followed by an elegant little symbol 4 bey
DENNIS

They used Arabic numerals
One twelfth

IAN
No One of twelve
(to Louise)
They’re telling us this is just
part of something bigger

LOUISE
They’re all meant to be combined

DENNIS
What’s that last symbol

LOUISE
-My name

INT “WAR ROOM” PRE-FAB BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Another structure built with the same materials as housing
only this is a much larger space It’s filled with glass-
walled conference rooms phone banks and more screens

Louise flanked by Ian and Dennis confronts Colonel Weber at
a conference table with Agent Halpern

Halpern is the Man in the suit and tie we’ve seen before the
main contributor to the giant white board of intel

She holds up the printout Dennis gave her

LOUISE
This is just one piece of it What
they’re telling us right here is
that ours is one of twelve We’re
part of a larger whole

AGENT HALPERN
Or we’re one of twelve contestants
for the prize

LOUISE
Who are you

COLONEL WEBER
Louise this is Special Agent Bill
Halpern of the CIA He’s been
overseeing the project

AGENT HALPERN
What Colonel Weber means is I’m the
one you should talk to from now on
if you want to stay on the team

This raises Louise’s hackles Still addressing Weber

LOUISE
We need to talk to the other sites
and help them with whatever they’ve
gotten from the other heptapods
Halpern shakes his head

He points
sites are

Nearby is
different

AGENT HALPERN

No can do Right now the only thing

that makes many of these nations

competitive is the alien technology

they’ve received

LOUISE
Who’s competing

COLONEL WEBER
Everyone All the time

LOUISE
This is telling us the pieces go
together

AGENT HALPERN
Does our power source work all on
its own

IAN
Technically yes

AGENT HALPERN
There you go

LOUISE
If I’ve learned anything from the
study of their language and their
way of thinking it’s that the
whole is far greater than the sum
of its parts

AGENT HALPERN
That’s a nice theory Let me give
you another one

to a digital map of the world where the landing

highlighted with glowing dots

that large whiteboard with all the intel from the

countries in control of their own sites

AGENT HALPERN (CONT’D)
Were all being given weapons To
fight among ourselves until only
one faction of humanity remains

LOUISE
That makes no sense
AGENT HALPERN
It does if you consider the
heptapods didn’t come here in
peace We are a world with no
single leader not even with a
global council It’s impossible to
deal with just one of us So they
let us fight until one is left

Halpern points at flat screen monitors

AGENT HALPERN (CONT’D)

Russia is rolling two tank
divisions to its borders and we
caught heat balloons in the engines
of eight nuclear subs in Polyanna

(pointing)
South American forces began
mobilizing last week in major
cities shutting down harbors

(another feed)
Japan and Korea are mobilizing
their long-range missiles

(at Louise)
We’re on the brink And our alien
friends just gave us all a shove

IAN
That’s not the way they think

AGENT HALPERN
It’s the way we think though And
that’s what matters

LOUISE

Look-- It’s easy to prove my
theory Have other teams look for
this symbol among the data they’ve
been given It will have their
translator’s name among these
logograms

AGENT HALPERN
That could simply be a receipt so
they know who accepted it

LOUISE
Not if these belong together

AGENT HALPERN
So what are you proposing We get
the data from one of the other
countries

LOUISE
And we offer our own in return

Halpern looks to Weber Is she serious
Weber nods

COLONEL WEBER
You were just saying how you wanna
see what the others are building
AGENT HALPERN
That’s the only way we’ll come to
the table A fair trade

IAN
So it’s a non-zero-sum game

Louise hears this and it dawns on her--

INT LOUISE’S STUDY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Hannah storms down the hall Picking up right where we left
her from the previous flashback

Louise sits forward with that same look of realization

LOUISE
A non-zero-sum game

Hannah stops Turns back around

HANNAH
That’s it Yes Thank you Mom

Hannah shuffles back into her room

Louise slowly touches her face an even deeper realization
now creeping into her conscious mind

What did I just do

COLONEL WEBER (VO)
(pre-lap)
What did you just do

Louise seems to hear the voice beside her and look--

INT “WAR ROOM” TENT - BACK TO SCENE

Weber stands at her side

LOUISE
I’m-- I’m sorry

COLONEL WEBER
What’s your angle in all this

LOUISE
In what

COLONEL WEBER
Getting everyone to share their
discoveries There must be some
gain for you with it

Louise is still a bit lost reeling from the effect she just
had on her own memory

LOUISE
Yes I get to go home

Louise turns and heads out passing Halpern who addresses
his team of agents with phones in their hands
AGENT HALPERN

Get London on the horn Then reach

out to the other ten however you

can Tell them we wanna make a

deal And use this as your calling

card See what it gets us

He shows them the same SYMBOL SET that contains Louise’s name
in the written heptapod language

Weber grabs a radio handset and triggers the base camp’s
speaker system

COLONEL WEBER
Media teams to the war room

EXT BASE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER
Louise makes stands outside and stares at the ship as
SOLDIERS and TECHNICIANS brush past her to the pre-fab
building
Reverse to reveal The portal tunnel slides open Inviting
No one seems to notice but Louise

She crosses the field to the shade of the massive ship

Louise takes one look around then steps inside

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

A new set of recording equipment has been brought in but the
chamber is otherwise empty

The heptapod side is vacant as well No Abbott or Costello

Louise goes to the console and lets her fingers trace the
edges of it This is starting to feel more like home

She looks back toward the tunnel out
It remains open She could leave now if she chose

Louise approaches the transparent boundary Tries to look
deeper into the alien ship She puts a hand on the wall

And the boundary dissipates Gone
Louise tests to see if it will return but it doesn’t

Cautious she ventures deeper into the room Now she’s on the
heptapod side

The only other door is the one the heptapods use to leave at
the end of each session No one has seen any more of the
ship Louise ventures to this doorway

She looks down the curved hallway beyond

More doors line the walls

Louise looks back at the human side of the room

And then steps out into the alien hall

INT CURVED HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Louise follows a subtle light trail down the corridor to
another door

LOUISE
Hello

As she nears the door it opens like an aperture

Louise steps inside

INT STASIS CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS

This room is circular with a kind of sensory-deprivation
tube in the center of the room Light emanates from the
central tube haloing a heptapod inside

Another heptapod steps into view Costello
Whisper-click it says

That same translator voice reverberates in this room as if
from the walls themselves

MALE VOICE (VO)
Hello Louise

LOUISE
Costello Is that you

Her words are converted into the hushed waterfall sounds and
organic clicks of the heptapod language in real time

Costello waves

LOUISE (CONTD)
What is this place

Costello speaks The translator speaks

MALE VOICE (VO)
Place for Abbott

Louise looks again at the tube

Abbott does not move He’s missing arms His body looks
wrong Darker in places Sunken in

LOUISE
Is Abbott okay

Gurgle-click-whisper

MALE VOICE (VO)
Abbott is dead

Louise is hit hard by this She forces herself to look away

LOUISE
I’m so sorry

Costello whispers

MALE VOICE (VO)
Abbott is a sign Abbott has
learned from Louise what all
heptapods must learn

LOUISE
I don’t understand

The lighting in the room shifts The circular walls now
reveal an elaborate series of logograms written densely in a
long chain all the way around the room

It’s like a giant ring with an inscription etched on the
inside

MALE VOICE (VO)

This is the story of our people
From origin to death A span of two
point nine billion human years

Louise marvels at it Steps closer

What she thought were solid lines creating the interconnected
logograms are actually SMALLER logograms themselves

LOUISE
It’s beautiful
(realizing)
How do you know the future

MALE VOICE (VO)

All of the moments in our life are
like memories We do not perceive
time as humans do

Louise follows the phrasing to the end

LOUISE
Where are you right now

Costello raises one of his arms and points
A sliver of light cuts vertically across the logogram--
Almost at the very end of the phrase

MALE VOICE (VO)

The end for heptapods is coming
This is why we are here To learn
from you And to help you

LOUISE
Learn from us Learn what

Costello turns and looks back at Abbott’s body

MALE VOICE (VO)

Power to choose Not to follow the
path of our story To break from
what we know is to come and choose
the unknown instead That is the
only way for us to survive now

LOUISE
Was Abbott supposed to die in the
explosion Was that his story

Costello stares at Abbott a beat As if in wonder
MALE VOICE (VO)
--No Abbott chose a different
path He broke his future And by
his death he has shown that all
heptapods are free
Costello turns his attention back to her Whisper-click
MALE VOICE (VO)
You are the key You choose life
Even knowing what the future holds
You light the way for us all
Louise tries to unpack that statement
Before she can the ship begins to rumble and vibrate

Costello waves at her Click-tone

MALE VOICE (VO)
Goodbye Louise

LOUISE
Wait Wait what are you doing

MALE VOICE (VO)
You must go
EXT BASE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER
The spherical ship powers up

The ground trembles

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS

Louise hurries past the consoles toward the exit--

INT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

--running full-tilt now as the series of ocular doors slide
shut behind her and the tunnel ahead of her begins to
constrict like eyelids closing--

EXT BASE CAMP - CONTINUOUS
Louise runs out of the ship

A heartbeat later the portal closes behind her sealing
completely

Louise stumbles on shaking ground and crashes to the grass
She turns back and looks up to see

More cables hooked to the ship SNAP as the sphere lifts

The ship RISES into the air Massive Majestic

The air beneath the sphere undulates like a mirage It rises
high into the clouds The cloud cover parts to give ita

clear path to the stars

The entire base camp is out now swarming the field and
looking up at the ship

A moment later the rising ship burns out of the atmosphere
and vaults into space at an angle like a shooting star

Two other shooting stars join it from other parts of the
world Then four more

Then all twelve are seen leaving
Louise stands up

COLONEL WEBER
What happened

LOUISE
They left

Beat Weber doesn’t exactly know what to say to this

COLONEL WEBER
Christ That’s it then

LOUISE
What

COLONEL WEBER
We got nine of the nations on the
line and they’re at each other’s
throats We’re minutes away from
global war

Everyone’s still looking up at the sky

IAN
We’re not dead yet

The word “dead” triggers something in Louise and--

INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A DOCTOR pulls the sheet over Hannah’s head

EXT CEMETERY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Louise stands at the grave

EXT BASE CAMP - BACK TO SCENE
Louise comes out of the flashes back in present day
Weber and others are making their way back to the War Room
Ian has hung back to be near Louise
IAN
You think we can do anything now
Or are we out of a job

Louise wobbles The flashbacks are affecting her physically

LOUISE
Hang onto me

He grabs her and keeps her from falling

IAN
Whoa now I got you

LOUISE
Promise--

And in a dull roaring sound Louise’s eyes roll back--

INT LOUISE’S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Louise stands at the refrigerator with her hand on the door

She stops whatever she was about to do-- whatever she wanted
to get from the fridge that task is abandoned

Louise reaches up and feels the length of her hair Looks at
her hands Notes her wedding ring-- she’s still wearing it

From the breakfast table behind her

HANNAH (0S)
Promise me Mommy

Louise finds HANNAH now age 7 seated at the table with
markers and a sketch pad

We hear an etherial pre-echo of Louise’s voice before she
speaks as if in a dream “Promise you--”

LOUISE
Promise you what sweetie

HANNAH
You won’t leave me like Daddy did

Louise goes to Hannah’s side and meets her eye-to-eye
LOUISE

Hannah honey your father didn’t
leave you You’ll see hima lot

HANNAH
He doesn’t look at me the same way
anymore

Louise touches Hannah’s hair She has so much love for her
daughter

LOUISE
That was my fault I told him
something he wasn’t ready to hear

HANNAH
What

LOUISE

Believe it or not I know something
that’s going to happen I can’t
explain how I know I just do When
I shared it with Daddy he got real
mad Said I made the wrong choice

HANNAH
Why What’s going to happen

LOUISE
It has to do with a very rare
disease And it can’t be stopped
(beat)
It doesn’t matter anymore What
matters is here and now Okay
What do I always say

HANNAH
“Live each moment”

She brings Hannah in close to hide the fact that she’s
trying not to cry

Louise breathes in the smell of Hannah’s hair
LOUISE
(to herself)
Hold onto this moment--
EXT BASE CAMP - BACK TO SCENE
Ian holds onto Louise
She realizes she’s back Sucks in a breath

Whatever she’s feeling she tucks it back inside
Two breaths later she’s back in control

IAN
What just happened to you

LOUISE
I remembered something

IAN
What was it

Louise looks into his eyes Considers not telling him

LOUISE
Why my husband left me

Ian didn’t expect that answer

IAN
You were married How long ago--

LOUISE
Come on We can’t let the CIA run
that war room

Ian watches her march for the war room

INT “WAR ROOM” TENT - MOMENTS LATER

A dozen screens line the walls of the main conference room
serving as video conference windows to the other nations who
have been interacting with their own landing site

Agent Halpern and Colonel Weber lean against the table at one
end a digital camera pointed at them

Halpern is in mid-conversation

AGENT HALPERN
And you can’t do that without
expecting escalation from all
sides Farak

Halpern addresses a SAUDI SHEIKH on one of the monitors
Other TALKING HEADS overlap and fight to make their points

COLONEL WEBER
This is getting out of hand

More screens show regional maps tracking air and naval fleet
movements The world has mobilized its militaries

Weber nods at the screens for Louise Under his breath

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
Right now forty-one thousand
nuclear warheads are armed and in
launch position Only six thousand
of them are ours

LOUISE
Who has the rest

COLONEL WEBER
(re talking heads)
Look around the room

SAUDI SHEIKH
We are merely responding to acts of
aggression--—

RUSSIAN REPRESENTATIVE
That is tantamount to war Farak

Louise attempts to interject

LOUISE
Please That’s not what this is
about

JAPANESE MINISTER
Who is this Colonel

COLONEL WEBER
Doctor Louise Banks She’s our
chief translator

LOUISE
Right now we are each holding a
piece to what the aliens left us
They are meant to be combined

BRITISH REPRESENTATIVE
What’s your evidence of this

LOUISE
It’s in the code It’s--
(to Weber)
--have you shown them the logogram

AGENT HALPERN
We’re not showing anything yet

LOUISE
At the end of every one of our data
streams there’s a marker “One of
twelve”

BRITISH REPRESENTATIVE
Are you saying you’re already
fluent in the alien writing

LOUISE
Aren’t we all

Weber sees the impending escalation just by the reactions on
the faces of the other representatives He leans in

COLONEL WEBER
Weve just been putting our focus
on that for some time--

JAPANESE MINISTER
Perhaps you will loan Doctor Banks
to the rest of us to expedite the
translation of some trickier
elements--—

AGENT HALPERN
We’re not giving her up

Now too many voices start overlapping all arguing
Louise looks to Ian What do we do
IAN
This is crazy It’s like something

out of a novel

The word ‘novel’ causes Louise to flinch another headache
Before she can respond--

INT LOUISE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Louise is asleep on the couch spooning a throw pillow She’s

napping in the middle of some long editorial project -- paper
and books are fanned out on the coffee table nearby

The doorbell rings and Louise stirs

HANNAH (0S)
I got it

Sounds of activity at the front door Hannah speaks to
someone on the front porch

HANNAH (0S) (CONTD)
I’1l sign for it

The door shuts A moment later Hannah (age 11) enters with a
package Louise rubs her neck

HANNAH (CONTD)
Delivery at the door can I open
it Please please
LOUISE
(smiles )
All right go ahead
Hannah tears into the package
It’s a HARD-BACK BOOK The back jacket A photo of Louise
HANNAH
It’s your new book But it’s not

coming out until next month

LOUISE
That’s an advance copy

Hannah opens it
INSERT The dedication page It reads simply

“To Hannah
For saving the world”

HANNAH
You dedicated it to me So awesome
(re-reading)
What does this mean

Louise stops pacing takes the book

LOUISE
I guess I was in a cryptic mood
As she re-reads it she becomes sad

LOUISE (CONTD)
It’s a sign

Louise looks up at her daughter then her gaze lands on
something on the opposite wall

A FRAMED PIECE OF ART
It’s Hannah’s drawing of her cartoon

Louise locks her attention on this picture Her vague
depression lifts with recognition

Handwritten on the art is the title of Hannah’s fictional
cartoon show
“Hannah and Mommy and Daddy Save the World”
And it’s a giant rocket ship
Louise pulls Hannah in close hugging her realizing
LOUISE (CONTD)
I wrote it because it’s true
Hannah You save the world
INT “WAR ROOM” TENT - BACK TO SCENE

Louise gasps as she returns to the moment

The argument has reached fever pitch and no one is listening
to anyone else anymore

The Russian screen winks off as they end their call
Another does the same

Louise rushes to the mic pushing Halpern and Weber out of
the way As loud as she can

LOUISE
I know what it is It’s a ship

The delegates grow quiet

BRITISH REPRESENTATIVE
What is a ship

LOUISE
What we have They’re components to
a Massive spacecraft

(MORE )

LOUISE (CONTD)
Britain You have the formula to
build a composite hull that is
impervious to cosmic radiation

The British rep balks but doesn’t correct her She continues
pointing at screens as she speaks

LOUISE (CONTD)

China You have a design that
revolutionizes life support

(then)
Peru You were given the key to
manipulating gravity

(and)
Japan You have a way of creating
pure water from air

SAUDI SHEIKH
Our data is not part of some space
ship Your theory is wrong

LOUISE
Sir you have what might be the
most important part You were given
a very small string of data that
offers celestial coordinates And
what you’1l find if you look there
is a planet with an atmosphere very
similar to Earth You have a map

JAPANESE MINISTER
What do you Americans have

LOUISE

The way there Our piece is a
propulsion system

(looking at Ian)
Our simulation seemed to disappear
Not because it’s invisible but
because at full speed it travels
faster than light

The look on Ian’s face Shock then a light-bulb moment
She’s right

LOUISE (CONTD)
We are at a critical moment right
here and now We’ve outgrown our
own planet and we need to colonize
if we want to give humanity a
legitimate future The decision we
make in this room decides the fate
of our race

(MORE )

LOUISE (CONTD)
We are either at the end of our
story or we’re at the very
beginning

IAN
The timeline

LOUISE
The test we were given For us the
heptapods showed a timeline

She trails off as she looks out at the dozen screens

The delegates are showing THE SAME TIMELINE on their screens
in different graphical versions They all got the same test

IAN
So you’re familiar with it

LOUISE
The choice we make now is the
choice of those two paths
(beat)
Who wants to go exploring

One at a time each delegate nods
In some screens a SCIENCE TEAM behind the delegate starts to
celebrate Men in LAB COATS Others in CIVILIAN CLOTHING
Ian clasps Louise on the shoulder
IAN
Don’t look now but I think you
just saved the world

She beams Then her smile fades

LOUISE
I need some air

Ian follows her outside

EXT BASE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

Louise steps out with Ian close behind
Weber follows and stops them both

The look on Weber’s face He’s awestruck Amazed
COLONEL WEBER

Louise You want to explain to me
what you just pulled back there
LOUISE
Sir

COLONEL WEBER

What you just did Closest thing
I’ve seen was a magic act in Vegas
this guy called out every card in
five different poker hands

(pointedly)
How did you know what everyone else
has You just pulled off what three
major intelligence agencies have
been trying to do for the past two
weeks How

Beat Louise shrugs
LOUISE
Best way to explain it would be
I remembered

Halpern steps out with one hand on the door

AGENT HALPERN
Colonel they’re asking for you

Weber smiles and shakes his head at Louise then turns
heads back inside

Before he disappears he looks back at Louise and Ian

COLONEL WEBER
I never went to Danvers

LOUISE
Excuse me

COLONEL WEBER
When I came to recruit you You
asked if I was going to Berkeley

(beat)
I never went I didn’t want anyone
but you
LOUISE

Then why tell me you were going to
see Danvers

COLONEL WEBER
If I had said you were the only
option would you have come

LOUISE
--Probably not

and
COLONEL WEBER
Now that we’re at the finish line
hopefully you understand why I
started with you like that
Weber walks off toward the war room Louise looks on

IAN
What now

Louise turns and walks toward the helipad

LOUISE
I’m going back home

Ian catches up with her and matches stride Smiling

IAN
Home I almost forgot what that
was

LOUISE

You should come over When you’re
in the neighborhood

IAN
Get me in the door I’m liable to
move in

LOUISE

Just don’t bring that orange couch
Ian stops in his tracks

IAN
How-- You are freaking me out now
I saw your lips moving when Weber
was talking to you a minute ago
You knew every word he was going to
say as he said it
(beat)
What’s happened to you up there

Tapping her temple lightly

LOUISE
Ian If you could suddenly see
your whole life clear as day all
your triumphs and your tragedies
would you change things even if it
meant losing the good with the bad

IAN
I’m more of a one-day-at-a-time
kind of man I don’t look back
I look forward

LOUISE
That’s a really good answer

Ian steps close to her

IAN
Louise I’ve been waiting for an
experience like this my entire
life I just never thought that
with all that’s happened the
highlight would be meeting someone
from the same planet as me

That’s all it takes for Louise She puts her arms around Ian
and kisses him on the mouth

As the kiss intensifies that high pitch returns triggering--

INT HANNAH’S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Louise hugs Hannah (age 4) goodnight
Hannah is in pajamas and under the covers

Louise goes to click off the light by Hannah’s bed

HANNAH
Mommy
LOUISE
Yes little-nose
HANNAH
Why is my name Hannah
LOUISE
Don’t you like it
HANNAH
I don’t know yet Where did it come
from
LOUISE

Oh so this is another episode of
your series “Why is it this way”

HANNAH
You make me curious about
everything

Louise smiles sweetly at her daughter She then gestures at a
wooden NAME PLAQUE spelling out HANNAH on the wall

LOUISE
Your name is special It’s a
palindrome That means you can read
it both forwards and backwards and
it’s still the same

Hannah gets it right away

HANNAH
I’ve decided I like my name

LOUISE
I love you Hannah

HANNAH
I love you Mommy

IAN (0S)
Well I love you both

Louise looks back at--

IAN standing in the doorway Smiling
Ian is Louise’s husband And Hannah’s father

HANNAH (0S)
I love you too Daddy

Ian steps in and scoops Hannah and Louise into a bear hug

A rush of noise again and--

EXT LAKE — DAY

Aerial shot following a black sedan as it pulls up to the
driveway of Louise’s house

LOUISE (VO)
So that is your story dear Hannah

Louise steps out It’s a military vehicle the driver leaves
her there

INT HAIR SALON - DAY

Louise chats with a STYLIST--

LOUISE
--have a big date tonight

STYLIST
We’1ll pull out all the stops

LOUISE (VO)
The heptapods gave us a choice and
we chose life We chose to keep the
human race going in spite of all
wed done to kill ourselves off

SERIES OF QUICK POPS

1) Staring at blueprints of a MASSIVE SPACE SHIP in a design
similar to the heptapod craft

2) Celestial photographs with a solar system circled in red

3) A sheet of composite metal unlike any seen before applied
to a larger structure by WELDERS

LOUISE (VO)
The story of our people continues
I can close my eyes and see moments
in the future as we build the ark

INT LOUISE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Louise stands before a full-length mirror holding up a dress
against her naked body Her hair wrapped in a towel

LOUISE (VO)
I’m about to make a choice too
One that I will have to live with
forever I could go either way

INT LOUISE’S FOYER - EVENING

The front door opens It’s IAN
Dressed up as nicely as he can be Bottle of wine in hand

Louise is dressed beautifully
Her new haircut is short Just like the flashbacks

IAN
Wow You look amazing
(re hair)
The change fits you well

She flashes him a devilish grin

EXT LAKE HOUSE BALCONY - NIGHT
Louise steps onto the balcony to see the sunset
Ian joins her Takes her hand
LOUISE (V0O)
In some ways this choice saves the
world but I’m not thinking about
that Hannah I never am
Ian smiles down at her
She smiles up at him

This is the same scene as the first Shot for shot

Every flashback we’ve seen hasn’t been from her past
Theyve been from her future

The new element Now we get to see it’s Ian on the deck with
her His thumb traces her knuckles

IAN
Louise Do you want to make a
baby

Beat The twinkle in her eye the thoughtful moment
It all breathes here

LOUISE (V0O)
I’m just thinking about you

Then

LOUISE
Yes

And now we stay here a moment longer than the opening scene
and see that while Louise is smiling a tear slips down her
cheek She is both the happiest and the saddest right now
Because she knows what happens next

FINAL SERIES OF SHOTS

1) Louise cradles NEWBORN HANNAH in her arms Hannah crooks
her tiny hand around Louise’s finger

2) Four-year-old HANNAH dressed as a cowgirl

HANNAH
Stick ‘em up

3) Hannah age 11 from when she’s grounded

HANNAH (CONTD)
When do I get to live my own life

hiding her face in her hands The Doctor reaches out and puts
a consoling hand on her shoulder Her body shifts from a sob

You choose life Even knowing what
is to come

Hold onto this moment

6) Louise at Hannah’s funeral

EXT TOWER APARTMENT BALCONY - NIGHT
Louise older now and no longer in the lake house leans on
the railing of her living room balcony Staring out at the
night sky
LOUISE (V0O)

It all happened just like I saw it

before you were born Your entire

story Sometimes I feel like I lost

you twice
On the horizon suddenly lighting up the darkness--

The launch of the first ark ship Plowing upward toward the
depths of space

LOUISE (VO)
But I can honestly say I wouldn’t
change a thing
Louise watches the ark leave atmosphere

Slowly she smiles

LOUISE (V0O)
Because I didn’t

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
