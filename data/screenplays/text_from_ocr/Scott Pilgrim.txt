So did you know that the original
name of Pac-man was Puck-man You
would think its because Pac-Man
kind of looks like a yellow hockey
puck but actually it comes from the
Japanese phrase paku-paku which
means to flap ones mouth open and
closed They changed it to Pac-Man
in North America because Puck-Man
wouldve been way too easy to
vandalize Like you know scratch
out the P and turn it into an F or
whatever

RAMONA
Ken has certain “attributes” that
Kyle doesn’t And Kyle is just a
really smart guy And I didn’t
exactly date them one after the
otherexactly

Suddenly another earth shaking BASS NOTE blows the snow off
of Scott and his amp He faces the Katamaris alone

The Katamari Twins play a futuristic robotic sounding song
Their wall of amplifiers TRANSFORMS into a giant AMPBOT

Wallace looks at Ramona realizing

WALLACE
Waitso youyou

RAMONA

WALLACE
(grins)
Decepticon

The Ampbot heads towards Scott and his tiny Lame Brand amp
marching in time with the Katamaris’ stomping Moog beat

RAMONA
But Scott doesn’t know that so
please keep it to yourself

WALLACE
Your Secret Safe Me

Wallace turns away and makes a face like hes trying to eat
the hottest chilli ever

The Ampbot spews a RAINBOW COLORED LASER BEAM from its
Mouth Scott DIVES AND ROLLS plays his bass harder trying
to repel the evil Ampbot with pure sound Another RAINBOW

KATAMARI TWINS
BOOOOOO

The Katamaris play their Moogs in perfect synch controlling
the Ampbot as it backs a defenseless Scott up against a wall

KATAMARI TWINS
We do not like your roll and rock

Wallace runs up to Scott and whispers something in his ear

scorTrT
Ramona said Kyle has a bigger cock

A DISSONANT NOTE sounds from the Ampbot as the Katamaris
fall out of sync for the first time

RAMONA
I did not say that

Kyle grins

KYLE KATAMARI
It is true

Ken SMASHES his keyboard over Kyles head The Ampbot
stumbles

KYLE KATAMARI (CONTD)
You dare strike the eldest brother

KEN KATAMARI
I truly regret we have same mother

Ken Katamari does a backflip and fires a Streetfighter 2
POWERBALL towards his brother destroying his Moog

Scott dives for his BASS slings it over his shoudler slaps
it hard and DESTROYS the weakened Ampbot

Ken and Kyle FIGHT EACH OTHER firing identical powerballs
They are quickly exhausted gasping for air

SCOTT
And now prepare to feel the wrath
of my slap bass eightfold path

Scott plays the MOST AMAZING BASS SOLO EVER The sound
overcomes the Katamaris Scott holds his bass in the air and
closes his eyes as THE THUMB OF GOD descends from the clouds
and slaps the strings The Katamaris EXPLODE into 20 dollars
worth of quarters and a GREEN SPOTTED MUSHROOM appears

SCOTT (CONTD)

Scott eats the Green Spotted Mushroom and gets an EXTRA MAN

Ramona nods

scoTrTr

Suddenly the sound of CLAPPING echoes across the lot GIDEON
glides across the snow Cheshire grin across his face

GIDEON
Hey Pilgrim Thanks for blowing up

GIDEON
No seriously thanks The only
thing better for indie cred than

GideonCredzilla FOLLOWS crushing everything in his path

GIDEON
I AM THE GOD OF COOL

108 EXT CN TOWER NIGHT 108

Scott and Knives Chau RUN UP THE SIDE OF THE CN TOWER at
supersonic speeds like Sonic the Hedgehog

¢ RAMONA

What’s the point of this building

scott
Although the CN Tower inspires a
sense of pride and inspiration for
Canadians and a sense of awe for
tourists its origins are firmly
rooted in practicality The
construction boom in Toronto in the
1960s transformed the skyline
characterized by relatively low
buildings into one dotted with
skyscrapers

KNIVES CHAU
These new buildings caused serious
communication problems The CN Tower
swiftly solved the communication
problems with room to spare so that
people living in the Toronto area
now enjoy some of the clearest
reception in North America

RAMONA
Fascinating

GideonCredzilla LOOMS over the CN Tower

GIDEON
Im bigger than the tallest
building in the world

Scott Knives and Ramona reach the top of the CN Tower
