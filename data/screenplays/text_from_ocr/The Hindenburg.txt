that theres a plot to sabotage the
LZ 129 on this flight

Angle widens to include Goebbels watching Kessler astutely
from behind his big desk

KESSLER
(returning letter)
Then obviously Dr Goebbels the
sane thing to do is cancel the
flight until the Gestapo uncovers
the plot

GOEBBELS
Sane perhaps but weak The prop-
aganda value of the LZ 129 is highly
important

KESSLER
Well from a military standpoint
shes a flying dinosaur

Colonel the LZ 129 is a world
symbol of Nazi power You should
be honored youve been chosen to a
guard her safety

air operations Its not espionage

GOEBBELS

s A Zeppelin ride should be a vacation
compared to Spain Youre being --
loaned shall we say to the LZ 129
as the officer in complete charge of
security for this trip Youll have
the power to arrest suspects or do
anything you think necessary But
quietly discreetly or it might
appear we have internal opposition
