INT BASEMENT - EVENING

A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE It dangles from the ceiling of a basement oo
LIGHT QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs

Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence She stands in the chilly basement

in an elegant summer dress that outlines her slender body Her gentle eyes move across

the empty room and come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall

She walks to the bortles Her fingertips slide over the labels She stops when she finds
just the right one A tiny smile as she slides it out

Anns tums to leave Stops She stares at the shadowy basement t’s an unsettling place
She stands very still and watches her breath form A TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR
Shes visibly uncomfortable

Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry Each step faster than the next She climbs
out of the basement in another burst of LIGHT QUICK FOOTSTEPS

WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH
THE LIGHTBULB DIES DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM
CUT TO

INT DINING ROOM - EVENING

Two place settings Two large plates of Chicken Francaise half eaten An empty botile of
white wine sits in the center of the table

“Anna arrives with the back up bore

MALCOLM CROWE sits in a stylish suit tie undone Malcolm is in his thirties with
thick wavy hair and striking intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study His
charming easy going smile spreads across his face He points

MALCOLM
Thats one fine frame How

Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up ons dinning room
chair It’s printed on aged parchment type paper The frame is a polished mahogany
Anna hands the back up bortle over to Malcolm

ANNA

(smiling)
Youre drunk I know cause
you start sounding like Dr
Seuss when youre drunk

Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glasses

MALCOLM
Im serious Serious I am

Anna giggles Shes clearly buzzed herself Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine
Her attention slowly moves to the framed certificate

ANNA
Mahogany Id say that cost
at Jeast a couple hundred
Maybe three

MALCOLM
Three We should hock it
Buy a CD rack for the
bedroom

ANNA
Do you know how imponant

Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat She Jeans forward from her seat and reads
the certificate out loud
ANNA

Anna’s expression is suddenly dead serious

ANNA
How can you ask me that
dont care how drunk you
are How could you even
wonder for a nanosecond
about that
MALCOLM
I wonder because if you
believe then

(beat)
I can believe

Anna gazes at her husband quietly

ANNA
You have a gift Not a gift
that allows you to hit a ball
over a fence Not a gift that
produces beautiful images on
a canvass Your gift teaches
children how to smile again
how to laugh and cherish life
Do you have any clue what
kind of miracle you are

(beat)
Yes I believe everything they
‘wrote about you And then
some

The effect on Malcolm is profound His eyes fill with emotion

MALCOLM
(whispers)
Thank you

Anna leans towards him They hold each other tight After a beat Anns Jeans back and
wipes her eyes

ANNA
There wasnt supposed to be
any crying at this celebration
Just a lot of drinking and sex

Malcolms charming easy going smile returns

MALCOLM
I would like some white wine
in a glass

Anna hands him his glass He stares at it
MALCOLM
I would not like it in a mug
would not like it in a jug

Malcolm Jooks at Anna surprised at what he said They crack up laughing THEIR
SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE

MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT

ANNA SCREAMS
Malcolm spins around His heart stops
Malcolm and Anna siare at the STRANGER seated on the edge of their bed

THE BEDROOM WINDOW IS SHATTERED THE WIND MOVES THROUGH THE
ROOM A lamp lays broken on the ground by the window

NO ONE MAKES A SOUND

The STRANGER seated on their bed is about nineteen Drugged out Pitch black eves
bulging His hands are folded on his lap He shakes ever so slightly as he sits

Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice Never takes his eyes off the stranger
MALCOLM

Anna barely nods her understanding
MALCOLM

Vincent closes his eyes and FIRES A VIOLENT EAR SHATTERING ECHO
Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll

Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head ANOTHER HORRIFIC BLAST
SPIKES THE AIR Vincent tips back on the bed as ifin slow motion

ANNAS CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME
DISSOLVE TO

EXT BENCH - AFTERNOON
The legend “Two Years Later” appears

A man flips open a wom file folder on his lap A passport sized photo of a ten year old
Vincent Gray sits clipped to the top of the papers Another picture sits loose in the folder
This one cut from a newspaper Its a picture of Vincent Gray at Nineteen

The man’s hand touches the pictures almost reverently

He glances through the decade old file Words and phrases are highlighted throughout the
file

Vincent Gray - Age 10”

Acute anxiety”

Socially isolated”

Possible mood disorder”

Parental status - Divorced”

Communication difficulty berween mother-child dyad”

a)

The man’s hands close the weathered file Slides a NEW FILE FOLDER on top Opens
it

A passpon sized picture of an eight year old child is clipped to the front This new boy
has dark hair and huge black eyes

As the mans fingers move through the pages of the file we again see words and phrases
highlighted throughout this new case history

“Cole Sear - Age 8”

“Acute anxiety”

“Socially isolated”

Possible mood disorder”

“Parental status - Divorced”

“Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad”

The hands close the file The hands are slightly shaking now
WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr Malcolm Crowe

Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street He
gazes blankly at the brownstones Beat

A door opens Malcolm is brought out of his trance

COLE SEAR steps out his front door Cole is a munchkin of a boy with large black eves
that seem to take in everything around him Cole carefully locks the door behind him

He moves to the botiom of the stairs and looks around nervously Anxiously

The eight year old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a pair of VERY LARGE
GLASSES They look comical on him

Malcolm rises to his feet He smoothes out his shirt Looks down and bumons his jacket
When he looks up Cole is gone

Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy Cole runs at full speed down the street and
turns the corner TINY SNEAKERS SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK

For a second Malcolm doesnt react The second passes He stuffs the files in his bag and
Starts running 100

CUT TO
EXT STREET - DAY

Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk He comes to a hard stop at a street intersection
Searches Spots Cole running into a parking lot

COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of building He has to use all

his strength to push open the highly ornate doors He slips inside

Malcolm jogs into the parking area His pace slows to a walk and then to stillness as he
gazes up at the building Its old stone and huge towers make it stand out from the modern
buildings all around it Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church quietly

A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE Malcolms hand goes to it quickly He waits
for it to pass before starting for the orate doors

CUT TO
INT CHURCH - DAY

Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews
Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what hes looking for in the last row of the
church

He moves down the center aisle towards the back

Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers Cole
makes the soldiers talk to each other

COLE
(soft)
ProFun Add

The words are unintelligible

Cole senses someone He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at him The boy
immediately goes white

MALCOLM
Its okay Cole Don’t be
frightened

Cole stays rigid Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen

MALCOLM
My name is Dr Malcolm
Crowe I was supposed to
meet you today Sorry
missed our appointment

Malcolm waits for a response None comes

MALCOLM
Do you mind if I sit down I
have this injury from a
couple years ago and it flares
up every once and a while
just so I wont forget it

Beat Cole slowly slides down the pew giving Malcolm most of the seat Malcolm sits

Cole fidgets with his soldiers Beat Malcolm looks over and stares at Coles glasses He
leans forward to inspect them more carefully

MALCOLM

Your eye frames They dont
seem to have any lenses in
them

COLE

(soft)
Theyre my dads The lenses
hurt my eyes

MALCOLM
I knew there was a sound
explanation

Malcolm returns to staring at his lap Beat

MALCOLM
What was that you were
saying before with your
soldiers Day pro fun

COLE
-De profundis clamo ad te
domine

Malcolm stares surprised

COLE
It’s called Latin Its a
language

Malcolm nods at the information
MALCOLM
All your soldiers speak
Latin

COLE
No just one

Malcolm smiles at Cole His eyes drift down to Coles arms Malcolms smile slowly
disappears

Coles arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES Some almost healed Some
fresh Malcolm looks around to gather himself Beat

MALCOLM
1 like churches too

(beat)
In olden times in Europe
people used to hide in
churches Claim sanctuary

Cole looks up

COLE
What were they hiding from

MALCOLM
Oh lots of things J suppose
Bad people for one People
who wanted to imprison
them Hurt them

COLE
Nothing bad can happen in a
church right
Malcolm studies Coles anxious face

MALCOLM
Right

Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other

COLE

Malcolm smiles

Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew

Cole thinks it over carefully

COLE

Cole and Malcolm just stare a1 each other
MALCOLM

And Cole next time J wont

COLE
Next time I wont be scared a”
of you
Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church Malcolm Joses himself in his thoughts

When Maicolm looks back he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and take a tiny STATUE
OF JESUS off the back table Cole pockets the statue and quietly leaves the church

Malcolm just sits and stares

CUT TO
INT MALCOLM’S HOME - EVENING
The house is dirnly lit Malcolm hes to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT

MALCOLM

He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table He stares at it blankly Almost
every envelope has “Over Due” or “Final Notice” stamped on it

INT DINING TABLE - EVENING
Malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place setting on the table
‘ CUT TO
INT BEDROOM - EVENING

Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom Only A READING LIGHT IS ON THE SOFT
LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS

Malcolm moves to her side The sight of her stops him
Re stares at his wife
She huddles under a blanket a wad of tissues in her hand He takes it in silently

His eyes move to her face One wisp of hair falls over her soft Jips OUTLINED IN
THE SOFT READING LIGHT Anna Crowe truly looks like an angel

Malcolm forms a tiny smile

CUT TO

INT HALL - NIGHT

Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hall He tries to open it IT STICKS
He yanks at it hard and opens it Malcolm disappears down a thin stairway

CUT TO
INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

The empty basement is no longer empty Jt’s piled with file cabinets and boxes of
psychology and medical books A desk sits in the corner next to the wine racks

The room still feels unsettling

Malcolm bunches over one of the boxes Rifles through s stack of dusty books Pulls out
2 thick text

The spine of the text reads “ The Meridian Latin Dictionary”
9 -

Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Coles file Handwritten on the first page are the
words
“De profundis clams ad te domine”

Malcolm starts working through the Latin text As he comes to each word he jots it down
underneath the Latin

Matcolm translates the last word
He stares quietly at the paper The new words read
“Out of the depths I ery to you Lord”
Beat
MALCOLM
(whispers)
- The mass for the dead
The words seem to hang in the air forever

of it Lynn Sear js an attractive and sweet looking young woman

Lynn shivers a little She moves to the thermostat and cranks up the heat She recurs to

shivering shoulders

Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps Lynns face appears in the
kitchen window

The two boys begin their walk down the street to school Tommy puts his arm around
Cole Lynn waves Cole waves back

When the two boys turn the comer and are out of Lynns sight Tommy rips his arm
away

TOMMY
Youre on your own freak

Tommy laughs and runs away

quiet walk down the sidewalk by himself

INT MR MARSCHALS LIVING ROOM - MORNING

This brownstone has been home to the Marschals for many many years Its filled with a
liferime of memories Memories shared by two people

Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that overlook the street A corner
table displays a fancy wooden chess set The game half-finished frozen in a layer of
dust An ease stands before a piano The incomplete water color painting of a smiling
elderly wornan sitting on the piano bench sits sadly on the faded yellow paper

Malcolm takes in the living room silently He stands near the open door

Cole walks through the room Tiny eves searching carefully He Jeans behind the sofa
looking for something Malcolm watches Cole with a crinkled brow

Cole peaks behind the old piano crammed against the wall
MR MARSCHAL
Maybe Jill will play for us
when she gets back

Cole turns to find Mr Marschal standing with a glass of lemonade Cole wakes it from his
shaking hands

COLE
Thank you

Mr Marschal shuffles over to the sofa Takes a seat

Cole begins surveying the room again Beat His eyes finally come to rest on a plant
seated in the corner He stares at it THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE
SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE

Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plans Cole kneels down and
starts to push the ported plant aside THE POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN
FLOOR

Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath

MALCOLM
Cole-

MR MARSCHAL
Whats going on there

Mr Marschal strains to see across the room

Cole doesn’t answer either of them Instead he continues to push the plant aside
revealing AN AIR VENT Cole gently reaches over and takes off the metal face It slips
right off

Cole’s hands disappear into the darkness of the vent They reernerge holding 2 STACK
OF NOTEBOOKS

Malcolm becomes very still

Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr Marschal Cole carefully
places them on his lap

MR MARSCHAL
Is this for me

Mr Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick glasses hanging from his
neck He places them on the tip of his nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his
face
MR MARSCHAL
Whats this Jill’s keeping a
diary
Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward

Mr Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks

- e meee we

MR MARSCHAL
Shes full of surprises

He gets to the last book His hands become still as he stares at the final page of writing
MR MARSCHAL
(whispers)
She hasnt written anything
for some time

Beat Mr Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks Looks up to Cole Cole just
stands quietly

Mr Marschals eyes slowly fill with tears of realization They gently spill down his
weathered face

MR MARSCHAL
Oh no

Cole takes a deep breath Trying hard not 10 cry himself The sight of Mr Marschal
weeping shakes Cole

Cole softly lays his hand on Mr Marschal’s silver hair Mr Marschal reaches up and
clutches his smal hand

They stay like that for a while Beat Mr Marschal lets go and brings the notebooks
tghter to his body

Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless He stares down at Cole in a daze
Cole turns his head crying
COLE
(softly)
Stop looking at me

Lynns eyes dan to an open guest room like she just saw something She stares in the
doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY

Her eves scan the darkness

Lynn doesn’t move She listens to the SILENCE Beat She starts back down the hall
picking up balled up boys sweat socks and diny T-shirts laying on the carpet When she
reaches the end of the hall she HITS A LIGHT SWITCH The hall LIGHTS UP
REVEALING A WALL OF PHOTOS Lynn forms a tiny smile

Snapshots of Cole and Lynns life hang before her eyes

Coles birthday panies Lynn and Cole st an amusement park Cole under the
Chrisunas tree Cole on Lynns shoulders in 8 pool Cole with a group of neighbors at
a barbecue

Lynn takes a step forward Lynns face betrays the fact that she notices something she
never noticed before She touches a photo of three year old Cole

WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO - COLES FACE SMILES AT US LYNNS FINGER
GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAK OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE

SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION

Lynn looks to the adjacent photo - the barbecue photo - Everyone stands with hot dogs
and sodas Lynn searches the picture Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF

picking clothes up around Coles room

This bedroom is an eerie place The shadows seem to make shapes and figures All the
furniture is wood - old fashioned The lamps the paintings on the wall - antiques as well

A small red camping tent sits in the comer A sign hangs over the entrance flap
“DO NOT TOUCH”
Lynn grabs the spiderman PJs that drape over the tent

A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow SEBASTIAN lifts his head sleepily and
peers at Lynn before returning to his slumber

Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under Coles pillow Slides
it out Its a FAMILY PHOTO Lynn and Cole and a man The man wears glasses and
smiles warmly at the camera The man looks in every way a larger version of Cole

The picture has a visible effect on Lynn She lets out a shaky breath before returning the
photo to its hiding place

Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll cover desk next to the bed

The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings Lynn’s eyes are drawn to
the papers

Her curious gaze turns serious Her mouth opens a tiny bit involuntarily

THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting Countless lines Thousands of
words Some horizontal some vertical The writing moves in arcs and flows in varies
sizes - written al great speed - every word connected by a single pen stroke - everything
written in one continuous motion

Lynn slowly spins the papers taking in sore of the phrases

Broken glass pray for help check the baby why didnt you come no one hears
walter rising no more pain

The words go on and on
Lynn removes her hands from the paper She pulls her headphones off slowly

out a heavy sigh

HIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM

moving through the inky darkness of the hail

pocket

On the girls desk is a large collection of video cassettes The labels read “Puppet Show

Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the closets He passes the bed

AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND
GRABS COLES ANKLE

stays very still Waits Nothing happens

He slowly bends down His hands touch the floor He tilts his head and looks under the
bed

wooden floor and stops just before Cole Cole and the sickly gir stare at each other
Neither of them say a word

The man’s face begins to crumble Beat He nods “yes” softly
Cole holds out the jewelry box It trembles with his hands
The father just stares at it Beat

The father becomes very still His eyes fill with a storm of confusion and pain After the
longest time the father reaches and gently takes the box out of Coles small hands

Cole begins to back away

goes to open the jewelry box His movements are slow and strained He lifts the latch

and opens the box

INT LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

People in the room start to turn as the TV comes on The mother’s attention is drawn
across the room as she watches her husband sitting before the television and VCR

THE STATIC SNOW ON THE SCREEN IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY AN IMAGE
TWO PUPPETS DANCE ON STAGE WE HEAR KARA’S VOICE SING FOR THE
PUPPETS AS THEY DANCE AROUND

Her fathers face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he watches the performance

The entire room has stopped what they were doing The girls mother notices as
everyones attention turns away from her

TVSCREEN

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS The puppets go limp The entire
stage gets lified up We see it carried away by Kara We can view the whole bedroom
now The camera is seated on her desk in the comer

Kara climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door opens Its Mrs Collins
She carries in a tray of soup and a sandwich

LIVING ROOM

The crowd watches in riveted silence The father never takes his eyes off of the screen
Mrs Collins rises from the couch

MOTHER
Jay

No one hears her All attention is riveted on the

TV SCREEN

The image of the mother prepares the meal She uncovers the fruit and the soup Places a
Straw into the drink

And then it happens

‘o

The image of the mother walks to a closet Opens it An assortment of household cleaners
and sponges are kept inside She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner Reads the label for the
ingredients Walks back to the food tray where she unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner

The mother pours the tiniest amount of the clear ammonia liquid into the childs soup
She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back in the closet

The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray She places the food on a
metallic rolling table and swings it over the bed

MRS COLLINS

Kara picks up the spoon and takes a sip Her face crinkles at the taste She looks up at her
mother

MOTHER

(video tape)
Don’t say it tastes funny You
know I don’t like to hear that

Kara slowly brings the spoon 10 her mouth and swallows another spoonful

The father SHUTS OFF THE TELEVISION with his trembling hands He presses his
hands to his eyes like they’re burning

The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT

Mrs Collins starts to move across the room towards her husband People move away
from her as she passes

The father looks up Their eyes meet The whole world stops

The mothers face begins to disintegrate under the glare of the father as he rises from his
seat Rage filling every cell of his body

MR COLLINS
You I can’t believe
(beat)
You were making her sick

Mr Collins rushes forward in an explosion of anger

MR COLLINS
What have you done

He gets restrained by family and friends around him The anger disappears as he’s held
tightly in the arms of his loved ones He collapses and begins to sob Mr Collins
dissolves in his grief

Mrs Collins stands still in the middle of the room She looks around at the horrified
faces

MRS COLLINS
I took care of her

Her words are met with ice cold stares She begins to shake Tears stream down her face
The pretty flowers of consolation in her hand tumble to the floor
