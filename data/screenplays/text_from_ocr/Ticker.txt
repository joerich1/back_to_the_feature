EXT METROPOLITAN CITY - DOWNTOWN - LATE NIGHT

Hot summer night The flesh district - hookers working
sidewalks stopping cars

MIKE REILLY 20s paces a corner restless looking for
action wet hair three-day beard trenchcoat

heat-seeking weary eyes He flashes a wad of bills in an
effort to get some attention no one notices

Across the street BILL RICE 50s a ragged transient
strolls over

RICE

ugly to get propositioned

REILLY
Look whos talking old man

RICE
Cmon its a quiet night

Rice starts away Reilly pauses then trudges after

EXT SIDESTREET - NIGHT

with their mouths full as they walk

They share a grin pass a BAG LADY who wears a pie-tin
crown
holding her hand out to a PIMP getting into a Cadillac

BAG LADY
A small gift sir for the Queen

The Pimp ignores her screeches off The Bag Lady pulls out
a pad adds his license number to a list glances up at Rice
and Reilly

BAG LADY (cont)

Rice fishes some change out of his pocket

RICE

BAG LADY

She pushes her shopping cart away Rice and Reilly look at
each other crack up surprised she knew he was a cop

REILLY

RICE

wish you had family

REILLY

No thanks I got close but it never woulda
worked

They stop beside a dirty beat-up Studebaker parked in

the
alley climb in Reilly behind the wheel
3 INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER

Cluttered with debris - clothes boxes personal items
Reilly jiggles the ignition - the engine coughs and
sputters

finally turns over

RICE

Why dont you just shoot it and put it out of
its misery

REILLY
What are you talking about its purring like
a kitty

RICE

rolls his

dead

windows

She didnt work out had to cut her loose

RICE
What was it this time

REILLY
She wanted to cook me breakfast

The White Van appears up ahead and turns into a
deserted buildings garage

Reilly and Rice exchange a glance as they wait to see
come on in the building They dont

Two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of
building briefly then disappear They hear a brief
argument that is cut short abruptly Then silence

REILLY (cont)
Cmon lets check it out

RICE
Were vice I didnt see no pimps or hookers
in that van But if youre so gung-ho wed
best call it in for some back-up

REILLY
Nah lets just take a look-see

Reilly jumps out and heads for the building Rice
eyes follows

INT BUILDING - NIGHT

A huge old battered machine shop Spooky darkness

quiet Moonlight filters in through dirt-smeared
The door CREAKS as Reilly and Rice slip in stop eyes

scan

Nothing Just rows of glistening machines

Rice gestures for Reilly to spread out They head in

footsteps echoing shadows washing over them

Still nothingdeeper deeper then glancing over
Reilly

sees a shape hiding behind a machine He steps towards
it

The shape whirls - a beautiful spitfire of a GIRL with

piercing blue eyes

She tries to bolt Reilly grabs her She struggles
pulls a

knife slashes his arm drawing blood through his
trenchcoat
111097 5

REILLY
Ow Son-of-a-bitch

He punches her full force in the face - she collapses
knocked out cold Rice rushes over

RICE
You okay

REILLY
Yeah just a nick

Then over Reillys shoulder Rice sees a dark SILHOUETTE
emerging from behind a machine Rice draws his pistol

RICE
Freeze Police

As Reilly whirls the Silhouette raises a Mac-1l

Rice shoves Reilly aside as the Silhouette OPENS FIRE
Diving for cover Reilly flings back his trenchcoat whips
out his 9mm and RETURNS FIRE at the Silhouette blowing the

shit out of windows behind sparks showering off machines

Silence for an instant Reilly looks for Rice and finds him
men

stealths

111097

Girl

bleeding to death on the floor nearby - he is completely
exposed to the line of fire

The Silhouette and another FIGURE OPEN FIRE on Reilly
SWAN 40s crazy-brilliant manic eyes and one of his
pale sweaty wearing an EARRING 30s continue the barrage

Swan fires ONE SHOT at a time at Rice deliberately aiming
not to kill him trying to flush Reilly out

Rice screams as BULLETS RIP into his legs Reilly tries to
reach him but cant shots forcing him back

A dark-eyed man with a BEARD appears in the bg and

towards Reilly from behind

Reilly face is in agony as Rice moans in pain He glances
urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them to The

lying next to him -- whats keeping them there Obviously
The Girl

She stirs Desperate Reilly grabs her by the hair shoves
his 9mm to her head Using her as a shield he drags her in
front of Rice to protect him

REILLY
(to gunmen)
Drop it

Swans eyes flare He steps out into the open gun aimed at
Rice eyes locked murderously on Reilly

SWAN
Let her go

Reilly cocks his hammer fingers trembling The Girl
stiffens terrified

Beard emerges behind Reilly Deadly silent he raises an
automatic trying to get a clear shot between machines

SWAN (cont)
No the girl
Reilly whirls sees Beard shrinks back to stay covered

EARRING
(to Swan)
We gotta get outta here

REILLY
(to Swan)
Tell them to drop it - now

A deadly stalemate Faraway SIRENS WAIL

111097 7

SWAN
You have no idea how sorry youre going to be
(to The Girl)
Dont worry

Beard smolders Earring sweats Keeping their guns up the
three men grab tool bags work their way to the alley door
and slip out

The moment theyre gone Reilly quickly handcuffs The Girl
to

a machine kneels cradles Rice

RICE

Turning a corner Reilly bumps into a bulldog of a cop

night before Glass searching intensely Reilly getting

and more uncomfortable

GLASS
So what were they doing here

REILLY
I dont know You tell me

GLASS
An abandoned machine shop nice place to
build devices Low rent too But you and
Rice ruined their perfect hideout

REILLY
You mentioned something called Redstone

GLASS
Redstones the army training center in Alabama
where they send the cream of the crop to learn
about tickers

REILLY
Cream of the crop huh You

GLASS
(nods)

Top of my class at West Point thank you very

much

Then off to Redstone First half of

the course we learned how to build devices
second half wed take them apart Everything
from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs

REILLY
Sounds like terrorist heaven

GLASS
There were a few guys in my class with names
like John Smith Bill Jones Id see them up
ahead in the hall call their name but they
wouldnt turn around CIA Funny thing
theyd always disappear after the first half
of the course

REILLY
Just how easy is it to build a device

GLASS
With a little training you could go into a
house and just from stuff in the bathroom and
kitchen make something thatd finish off that
alleged car of yours Heck didnt you ever
watch MacGyver

Reilly looks at Glass strangely until he realizes theyve
stopped where Rice died

GLASS (cont)
So this is where it happened

Reilly fights the memory eyes well up his hand trembles
ever so slightly as he points out

REILLY
Girl was here The guy in charge was over
there with one of his men the other one was
back there

Glass gets down on his hands and knees scans the floor
Reilly talks to distract himself

REILLY (cont)
Bombers what kettle of fish are
they

GLASS
Typical profile usually losers nobodies
thatre afraid to confront their victims
They like scaring people Thats why they
call in their threats Same mentality as
obscene phone callers

REILLY
Except theyll blow you up if you
dont play along

GLASS
No ninety-ninety percent of them are full of
baloney Theyre into the power trip not the
damage What scares me is that this guy is so
sophisticated he could blow up whatever he
wants then disappear The worst of the
bunch they love the challenge of creating the
wildest device ever and they love the
carnage

Glass lays out flat on his stomach and searches deep under a
machine picks up a half-smoked cigarette butt with

tweezers
