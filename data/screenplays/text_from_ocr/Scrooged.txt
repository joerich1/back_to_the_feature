EXT NORTH POLE - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT of Santas Workshop -- a quaint
gingerbread cottage nestled in a serene snow-covered
valley Smoke curls from the chimney MUSIC Silent
Night played on a celeste enhances the Christmas card
peace and beauty

WE MOVE CLOSER and isolate details
A candy-striped column marked NORTH POLE

Below the glistening icicle-trimmed eave silhouetted
on the shade of a frost-veiled window ELVES put the
final touches on some toys -- tapping an extra nail
adding that last dab of paint

REINDEER nervously paw the ground gently jangling their
sleighbells as they shake the snow from their antlers

Cheeks fat with acorns a CHIPMUNK scampers across the
yard to his home behind the woodpile

A rusty old weathervane CREAKS in the breeze All the
arrows are stamped Ss

In the sleigh sits a huge sack overflowing with gifts
which include toy drums bisque dolls teddybears

Backlit by the full moon a SNOWY OWL hoots softly and
shuts his eyes

The sky sparkles with stars but oneshines brighter than
the rest Is it a falling star No its a flaming
mortar shell that screams into the cottage and explodes
in a teeth-jarring fireball of MULTIPLE BLASTS

MUSIC changes to standard TV action fare as a
gritty-voiced ANNOUNCER cuts in

REVEAL that we have been watching a TV screen in an

on the wall A table is ringed with network EXECUTIVES
At one end of the table is the big TV monitor At the
other end sits FRANK CROSS president of IBC who
presides over the meeting

Frank is trim polished and good-looking At
thirty-eight he is young for the powerful position he
holds The press still calls him a TV wonderkind
Co-workers call him the “Smiling Viper

MRS GRACE COOLEY his attractive black secretary sits
near him taking notes

This is a power office -- bleak modern and immense It
is on the 22nd floor with huge grid windows that look
down on New York City Its designed to impress and
intimidate There is futuristic design furniture a wall
of TV monitors a private bathroom a small kitchen a
bar Above the ultra-modern desk hangs a Picasso from
his 1907-8 African-Negro” period The walls are
decorated with primitive masks the closest thing Frank
has to a hobby The massive desk is littered with
Scrooge miscellany -- drawings models posters
swatches etc

No one speaks waiting for Franks reaction There are
a few nervous coughs

Finally Frank leans forward in the chair

is a decayed corpse a Rick Baker nightmare with moss
growing on him and a mouse-hole in his forehead

LEW
Hi Frank Do you mind if I help
myself to a drink

Swinging a rusted putter Lew ambles across the room to
the bar and pours himself a Scotch His golf shoes click
on the parquet

Frank is not easily rattled He opens a drawer and pulis
out a revolver Holding the gun police-style with both
hands he empties it into Lews back Five shots hit him
with a dull thek kicking up a little dust Its like
shooting an old pillow The other shot shatters the
glass of Scotch

Lew turns around holding the broken glass

LEW
I dont mind if you hit me
Frank but take it easy on the
Dewars

He turns back to make himself a new drink
Frank drops the gun Now hes rattled
Lew raises his glass in a toast

LEW
To old times

- And downs it The Scotch cascades out the holes in
his throat and forms a puddle at his feet

Frank steps forward recognizing him

And from that day forward it
was always said of him that he
knew how to keep Christmas well
if anyone alive possessed the
knowledge He became as good a
friend as good a brother as
good a boss as good a father
as the good old city knew And
he worked to make the world a
happy place where children laugh
and men dream dreams of peace and
‘angels sing
