SERGEANT BURKE
The autopsy results indicate a
grill guard

ETHAN
How

( )

SERGEANT BURKE
(reluctant) Josh suffered a sharp
blow to the rib cage which
fractured several ribs and
unfortunately drove one into his
heart He died instantly no
pain

GRACE
How do you know

SERGEANT BURKE
(lies)
The medical officers assured me

ETHAN
You’re looking for a dark SUV with
a grill guard Anything more

SERGEANT BURKE
It helps us narrow the field
somewhat We’re still working on
the headlight glass and we’re
canvasing the area On Sunday we
intend to set up checkpoints at
the time of the accident
Question drivers who may have
passed

GRACE
But its been seven days now

ETHAN
He could be in Mexico by now

SERGEANT BURKE
These investigations can take
time

GRACE
If you catch him What will
happen to him

SERGEANT BURKE
He’1ll be prosecuted to the full
extent of the law

ETHAN
Which is what

SERGEANT BURKE
Depending on the circumstances he
could get ten years in prison

( )

ETHAN
What does depending on the
circumstances mean

SERGEANT BURKE
The state of Connecticut has a
variety of sentencing criteria
that have to be assessed

GRACE
I don’t understand he killed our
son

ETHAN
How many people get away with
this

SERGEANT BURKE
You know Mr Learner I don’t have
the exact figures but I’1l get
them for you Rest assured we

A Persian student RASHID is talking angrily

RASHID
The cable news channels and the
politicians have you Americans
deluded

ETHAN
How so Rashid

RASHID
They make you believe you are a
warrior nation with an invincible
army Your machinery is tough
but this country has grown soft

BRETT
(interrupts)
Bullshit There’s no army in the
world can defeat us it’s the
terrorists

ETHAN
Let him finish Brett

( )

RASHID
You come from Connecticut one of
the most affluent comfortable
safe places in the world My
people like most of the world
come from a place that knows pain
and suffering violence loss

AMERICAN GIRL

AMERICAN GIRL (CONT’D)
Are you saying that Persians or
Africans feel pain differently
from us

RASHID
No no it is the same I’m
saying they live with pain and
death every day You don’t you
have become soft

AFRICAN AMERICAN
Poor Americans Blacks Hispanics
aren’t soft

RASHID
Yes but most Americans are
insulated from death Look at
Vietnam Somalia Iraq

In the heat of the argument Rashid has forgotten the
circumstances The class becomes silently uncomfortable

RASHID (CONTD)
Americans fall apart at the sight
of coffins They loose their
resolve

Ethan is completely absorbed in what Rashid is saying
then he notices the class discomfort Rashid now
notices

I’m sorry Mr Learner I never
meant

ETHAN (CONTD)
Have you been here before

No no Why do you ask

ETHAN
I thought maybe you’d come to
familiarize yourself with the
case

waiting Look how beautiful it is
Here’s what I’d like to do I’d
like to offer a reward a big one
250000 a half a million
whatever I can borrow on the
house Get the press to come
here That would give me a chance
to make an appeal to ask this man
how he can live with himself How
he could do such a cowardly thing
as to drive away and leave a ten
year old boy dying in the dirt
Do you think that would work

DWIGHT
Yeah that might spark something

SOFTBALL GAME in
