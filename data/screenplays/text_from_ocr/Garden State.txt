(through crackly radio)

2-2 Heavy Pull upt Pull up

The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA SOPRANO
VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi
prayer

INT AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT

THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE

SLOW MOTION The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics
and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like
plastic pendulums The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer

ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE) 25 is the only passenger who
remains unfazed Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
reflections on his cheeks even as the young mother seated
next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God even
as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and
the beverage cart slides down the aisle Andrew Largeman

peacefully unaffected

He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
directly on him He looks up to
in

THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN

it BINGS as the light flashes on and off The BINGING
continues more and more frequently at first in rhythm with
the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an

ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE
DISSOLVE TO

INT BEDROOM -- MORNING

Whiteness Morning sun streams through a palatial picture
window THE PHONE continues to RING A ceiling fan spins
above stacks of scripts a cell phone charging bare walls
and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed

which he sleeps

HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
like theyre chasing each other in a game of tag

THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine Larges eyes
stop moving

VOICE ON MACHINE (0S)
Andrew This is your father
LARGES EYES slowly float open

VOICE

Im sorry Im so sorry But she

drowned in the bath

BEEP The machine cuts the voice off
LARGES EYES processing

They elide slowly left then back right as if scanning in
data He blinks He blinks again slowly His eyelids float
closed He falls back to sleep

FADE TO BLACK-

IN BLACK
The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink

INT BATHROOM -- MORNING

Large appears to stare directly at us Hes dazed His body
is there but his mind seems absent He reaches to the

of the frame almost at us and pulls open both doors of the
mirror hes been staring into

His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two
dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately
line the shelves of his medicine cabinet

He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself
MUSIC CUB (DONT PANIC BY COLDPLAY)
EXT CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER

Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break
He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries
to find an address while checking a piece of paper

He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-
stairs

After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a
lines

gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him
Large registers something he isnt going anywhere

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal hes been walking up on the
down side He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
down where he moves to the Up one and rises towards the
next level His expression never changes

INT CASTING OFFICE -- DAY

A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and
manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly Large
sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him
theyre even dressed alike

ASSISTANT
Casting please hold casting

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL they are sitting beneath an eight
foot photograph of Urkel wagging his finger at the camera
A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other
actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their

to themselves
The ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him

ACTOR

We hold on Large as he swings his gaze to the actor on his
other side aggressively running his lines to the air

INT LARGE S CAR -- DAY

Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405
freeway Large stares absently out the window as BLARING
SIRENS compete with the obnoxious ramblings of LA TALK

Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in
pain

EXT FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Large pulls his car into a parking spot throws The Club

his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the
restaurant But something catches his eye on the side of his
car

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a gasoline pump nozzle
sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped
off at the end He stares at it trying to remember the last
time he bought gas He looks both ways and covertly pulls

nozzle from his tank
He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws
the nozzle in an open dumpater

INT FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Large flings open the door and enters a long dark corridor
lined with stacked chairs He passes a WAITER in a black
TUNIC wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian

WAITER
Dick head Youve got thirty-four
and twenty-five seated and Taylor
booked a pilot so he quit You
picked a bad night to be late

Large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any
of the stress He rounds a corner to a time card machine and
swipes his card The machine BEEPS and displays the word
LATE in red He crosses to a locker and quickly changes
into a black tunic and pants
He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over
thirty people in white chopping frying sauteing YELLING
The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down

line Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER She walks with
him as he weaves his way through the kitchen
looking

it

FRENCH MANAGER

(FRENCH ACCENT)
Ten resumes just today They come
in everyday from Idaho or Florida
or Milwaukee and do you know what
they want even more than a guest
spot on Everybody Loves Raymond
They want your job This will not
happen again This will never
happen again You have two tables
You are thirty minutes late if I
ever say this again your job will

GO TO
She pulls off the top resume from the bunch shes grasping
revealing a headshot on the other side

FRENCH MANAGER (CONTD)

Todd Slauson from Duluth

Minnesota

During all this Large remains calm and unphased He takes a
stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints
his eyes to appear Asian (As do all the white good-

male waiters)
He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of
the tunic and turns it on He unwinds the ear piece pulls

through the back of his jacket out the neck and into his
ear Immediately we hear a VIETNAMESE MANS VOICE giving
orders over the ear piece

VIETNAMESE VOICE (0S)

(accented but monotone)

Waiter number fifteen your table

number twenty-three is ready

Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into

INT DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

A very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to
capacity with a Friday evening crowd The energy is
completely different from the other side of the door SOFT
ASIAN MUSIC plays the room is very dim and lit by
candlelight

THE BLARE OF A JET LINER TARING OFF dissolves into

INT AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY

THE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink
in a very long row He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his
eyes closed in pain for a brief second

A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line

sinks As he passes each sink he unknowingly activates

motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water
The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of
Once Twice Three Times A Lady with synthesizer
accompaniment

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin
Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking
woman in a wheelchair This is SARAH LARGEMAN

We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN the source of the music CLOSE ON
HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her
cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the
father

the

quite

tip of her chin and drips li

e a leaky faucet onto

HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words

ONCE and TWICE

The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew

prayers

Large squints through the mourners to see his

GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket

Behind him stands CYNTHIA DI

his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the

FASTER hands gripping each other a nose on a neck hands
gripping a waist

Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end

corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile

The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally

BLACKNESS

A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness Morning sun
streams through a window revealing Larges face full frame
eyes still closed Across his forehead in thick black marker
the word BALLS is written

His eyes open wide He has no idea where he is His eyeballs
swing left then right As Large site up

THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are

INT MARKS LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan White morning
sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to
highlight the duet in the air

A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large s eyes open He has no

where he is

Larges POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a
person walking around like a hunters amateur video of his
Bigfoot sighting

He can only make out pieces a sword boots then a cereal
box

Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view a medieval
night in full regalia They make eye contact for a second
and Large slams his eyes shut When he opens them again the
night is gone

Large site alone in a barren
staring at all the diplomas

DOCTOR
Mr Andrew Largeman

LARGE
Yes - hi

DOCTOR

Dont worry Sam well get to you
Large turns to Sam She looks away

INT NEUROLOGISTS OFFICE - DAY

office He pans around the room
His eyes follow them up from

the ceiling to reveal theres
The doctor enters

Theres absolutely nothing wrong

with you
Large stares

LARGE
What

DOCTOR

Im just kidding how would I know

that
LARGE
Yeah
They shape hands

DOCTOR
Im Doctor Cohen What can we do
for you today Andrew

LARGE
Ive been having these really
intense headaches They only last
for a split second and then theyre
gone Its like a lightning flash
almost like a surge of electricity
and then its gone
He looks at the chart

DOCTOR
Youre Gideons kid I didnt even
put the two together

LARGE
Yeah

DOCTOR
Im sorry about youre Mother

LARGE
Yeah Thank you

DOCTOR
I must have missed you at Shiva
last night

LARGE
Yeah

DOCTOR
So how long have these headaches

been going on

LARGE
Well I think Ive had them in some
form since I was a little kid But
theyve been getting more and more
frequent over the last year

DOCTOR
(looking at chart)
How long have you been on the
Lithium

LARGE
Oh uh Ive been on some form of it
since I was ten or so

DOCTOR
And what about Paxil Zoloft
Celexa Depakote did any of that
ever help you

LARGE
No I mean I dont know Its
recently occurred to me that I
might not even have a problem only
Id never know it because as far
back as I can remember Ive been
medicated I grew up on it I left
them in LA This is the first time
I havent had it in my body since I
can remember

DOCTOR
Well itll leave your body pretty
fast Ill write you a
prescription

LARGE
Actually I was thinking about
taking a little vacation

Re¢ 42

DOCTOR
Have you spoken to your
psychiatrist about that
LARGE
E)h well my psychiatrist is my Dad
So uh he I think hed prefer
me to stay on it He likes to think
it makes me happy And I let him
think that because hes sort of
consumed by the idea of making
everyone happy

DOCTOR
Well look Ill examine you and
give you a Catscan just so you
wont worry that its anything
serious But to be honest I think
the headaches are something else
Our bodies do very funny things
when theyre consumed with stress
and anxiety Things youd never
expect I found my ex-best friends
cuff links in my wifes puree and I
couldnt get an erection for a year
and a half

(BEAT)
For example

LARGE
But that doesnt really feel like
it I mean I dont feel stressed or
really anxious at all

DOCTOR
Well with all the Lithium hes had
you on its amazing you can even
hear me right now

LARGE
Oh right

DOCTOR
First of all I do think you need
to find a psychiatrist that isnt
your father That justs something
that should have been remedied
years ago He knows better
Secondly Im not in a position to
comment on whether or not you
should stay on the meds or not I
dont know your story But my
opinion since youre paying for
it is that those drugs may help as
bus

a means to an end But if youre
not In any sort of therapy sooner
or later whats ever going on in
your mind will find a way to peek
its little head out of the water
Just something to think about

(MORE)

But for now lets have a look at
you

Not to say fish deserve less than
other animals but moat people just
flush them and we just dont
believe in that I mean the idea of
flushing something that had life in

You gotta honor something a little
more than that like
Congratulations man you had
life Heres your trophy a little
spot in the ground to hang out in

(BEAT)
Anyway Im gonna put Jelly right
here next to Goliath the
Rotweiler Titembay backed over
during his driving exam
She kneels down and begins to dig with a small shovel left

Goodbye I hope that you liked me
Tears stream down her face as she shovels dirt onto the tiny
shoe box THE PATTER of the SOIL HITTING the BOX is the only
sound we hear as
THE CAMERA CRANES UP above them to a birds-eye perspective
settling on a final frame that looks down on the whole
backyard the above ground pool the pet cemetery and in the
bottom right corner Sam burying as Large watches

INT LARGEMAN MANSION LIVING ROOM - DAY

Once again Shiva is in full swing

Large passes through a doorway and begins to hear a
COMPUTERIZED SEEPING to the tune of the ShmaA° (A Jewish
prayer) He looks to his left to see an electronic Mazooza

the door frame it says The Sharper image on the bottom
He moves his head back and forth past its censor and each
time it begins the BEEPING of the Shma anew

THE LIVING ROOM
A tired looking man in his 50s eating a cookie

TIRED MAN
Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to
be musicals As in Broadway
musicals Can you believe that
Pauls kids theme was the Meta I
got to do the Elora with Mookie
Wilson Miriam and I were at one
last weekend at the Pierre whole
thing was like a winter
wonderland live penguins wearing
yalmulkas Now me I got to lay out
ten grand alone for some asshole to
build a barricade of French garbage
across the boccie lanes at my
tennis club
THE CAMERA PICKS UP LARGE holding a plate of food as he
approaches Cynthia She sits alone with a big photo album on
her lap
LARGE
I was just thinking-

(BEAT)
I was just thinking you spend
youre whole life lusting for
anything you dont have You stress
over money and your career you set
your clocks back you exercise you
wait in line you paint your house
get depressed feel better buy
things take your clothes to the
dry cleaner set your clocks
forward and spend your whole life
waiting for happiness to arrive in
the mail Then you die and people
are really sad they cry really
hard

(BEAT)
and then they go eat lunch
Hetakes a bite of his bagel

CYNTHIA
Oh please be a little more
interesting than that

(MORE )

Please dont be the brooding guy
Thats so unoriginal Id rather
hold onto who I imagined youd
become

LARGE
Miss me

CYNTHIA
No Me

LARGE

No
(BEAT)
She didnt like being alive She
got what she wanted This should be
a party Instead were supposed to
mope About what She never did
anything

CYNTHIA
She made you

LARGE
some trophy I do have to say Im
impressed with the turnout

CYNTHIA
What you didnt think people would
come

LARGE
Seems to me the only thing more
depressing than a funeral is a
funeral where no one shows up
Dont you ever think about wholl
show up to yours

CYNTHIA
No Right now Im alive so I think
about living

LARGE
Its one way to determine who your
friends are The people whod show
up at my funeral if it was held in
their state thats one level of
friend But my real friends the
people who really love me theyd
come if it was on the other side of
the country

CYNTHIA
So where do I fall into that

LARGE
Youd be there

CYNTHIA
Oh you think so

LARGE

I do I think youd show up because
the truth is that you really did
miss met you always thought of me
as the brother you never had But
youve got too much pride to let me
know that You want to pout cause
I dont return your calls

CYNTHIA
youre way more talkative than I
remember

LARGE
Today Ive been more talkative than
I remember

CYNTHIA
What about mine

LARGE
Funeral Honestly I probably
wouldnt travel for it- no But
dont worry Im sure youll have a
great turnout

CYNTHIA
Why do you say that

LARGE
Cause theres also the guy who
lives his life to insure a good
turnout I think thats how my Dad
lives his- like hes sort of
writing his own eulogy as he goes
and making life choices dependent
on how it will sound in a speech

CYNTHIA
Are you implying that thats why
Im going to med school or
something

LARGE
Im just saying a lot of people -
not necessarily you - a lot of
people try and accumulate accolades
that will somehow justify their
lives

CYNTHIA
Its said we spend ninety-five
percent of our lives trying to look
good

LARGE
Where do I sign up for not caring

CYNTHIA
How about sucking it up and really
having it out with your Dad That
would be a tremendous step towards
not needing to look good

LARGE
Wow that was so clever how you did
that Is he grooming you to be a
psychiatrist too Med schools one
thing but please dont become him

CYNTHIA
Hes one of the most caring people
Ive ever met

LARGE
well you would say that youre the
son and daughter he never had
Hell youre the family he never
had Has he got you on Lithium
yet Wait till he does youll love
him even more
He stands

CYNTHIA
I bet my Mom a dollar you were
coming home with a message I said
after nine years hes definitely
hands

steps

of

edges

coming home with a message
LARGE
i looked for a message I got bored
and became an actor

GIDEON
I knew that you would
Silence

GIDEON (CONTD)
Occasionally she would hum your
Mother Always the same tune and I
never knew what the song was I
dont even know if it was a song or
if she just made it up - Its funny
because it always struck me as so
out of character for her and every
time she did it I just always
liked it But I never told her I
could hear her because I knew if I
ever did she would stop

(BEAT)
She took a bath every night And
she was always very quiet

(MORE )

The only thing I would ever hear
when Im in the bedroom was a
little splashing of water when she
was moving around And every now
and then her humming

(BEAT)
so anyway then usually she would
call me when she was done so I
could come and help her out But
this time that night she never
called And I just figured she was
taking a longer bath or something
but when I called out to her she
didnt answer So then I uh When
I came in she was there

LARGE
So she didnt yell or

GIDEON
No I didnt hear anything The TV
was on pretty loud I always watch
the weather report before I go to
sleep

LARGE
Its just weird

GIDEON
What

LARGE
I dont know its just that youd
think if someone was really
drowning to death they would
scream I mean really scream from
the terror of it all you know
They would splash and scream I
would think I would have thought

GIDEON
I would have too but no Nothing
(off Larges look)
What

LARGE
Dont take this the wrong way

GIDEON
What

LARGE
Im not reading into this Im just
thinking out loud so dont get

UPSET-

GIDEON
What No

LARGE
What

GIDEON
Its not that

LARGE

Im just saying did they check I
mean has someone ruled that out

GIDEON
No Because they know she drowned
Andrew

LARGE
Im just saying the facts
GIDEON
No

LARGE
And I suppose it doesnt even
really matter But Id be curious
to know I would like to know if
thats what happened just for me
I mean would that surprise you

GIDEON
No Yee

LARGE
She made it very clear to everyone
she knew that nothing was ever
going to make her happy-

GIDEON
I know Do you think I dont know

LARGE
And cmon lets be honest she
tried it before

GIDEON
Shut-up lust shut your fucking
mouth
Large is taken aback

GIDEON (CONTD)

(FIGHTING TEARS)
If nothing else will you please
just leave her alone Shes gone
Thats it Thats all you get She
died We will never see her again
She tried very hard but she just
couldnt find it She could never
find it And I think - I know that
shes found it now I know that
And I know theres a certain amount
of guilt that you must feel for the
way things unfolded but its too
late now

(MORE )

So Im asking you for me not to

do that Dont come here and do
that

LARGE
I think I deserve to know the
truth

GIDEON

You want to make her crazy Why

Does that make it easier for you

Tears stream down Gideons face He sits down on the toilet
and cries

GIDEON (CONTD)
Its like you want to torture
yourself or something Why would
you want to think that That that
happened Why would you ever want
to think that
Large moves closer to his father who SOBS with his head in
his lap and his arms over his head It takes everything
Large
has to reach out his hand and almost touch his fathers
shoulder but he doesnt make it and his hand lands on the
sink next to him

GIDEON (CONTD)
I just want everyone to be happy
again

(BEAT)
I dreamt last night that I had
special powers If I squeezed my
eyes shut and clinched my fiats
closed tight enough wed all wake
up in paradise

freak thing it was I Say whole

life she was depressed for no

reason Look at this picture

He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing
chicken slippers out of his wallet

LARGE (CONTD)
Look at her face Thats how she
was every single day of her life
And one day I was nine years old
and I just really hated her for
that and I pushed her

(BEAT)
I mean it was innocent I was just
frustrated cause

SAM
You couldnt make her happy

LARGE
Yeah Fuck yeah And any other
time she would have just yelled at
me and sent me to my room but this
time in that moment the door of
the dishwasher was open The latch
on it was broken and it would just
randomly fall open That fucking
latch its funny how so much of my
life hasbeendetermined by a
quarterinchpiece of plastic So
she fellbackover the door and her
neck hitthekitchen counter
paralyzing her from the waist down
Sams eyes are wide in shock

SAM
Oh my God

LARGE
Still want to compare fucked up
families

JESSE
But your Mom was in the wheelchair
long before you left

LARGE
Well I was nine They sent me to
therapy and my Father put me on
these drugs that were supposed to
curb my anger And Ive been on
some form of them ever since My
Mother who was clinically depressed
before the accident sank even
lower to the point where she just
ignored everyone but our
housekeeper Janice and her
daughter Cynthia And when I was
sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came
around to the conclusion that it
might not be the healthiest
environment for me to be growing up
in So he sent me to boarding
school And I havent been home
since

SAM
Until now

MARK
For her funeral

LARGE
Until now for her funeral Im off
to a ripping start in this life
huh Next time through I think Ill
lay low out of the gate

LARGE (CONT D)

The thing is though when I think
about it I wasnt really
abnormally angry at all I mean it

prescribed all these drugs for
anxiety and depression and anger so

are

AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY

Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the

bottom They stand on the edge Rain clouds rapidly drift
overhead This glace is surreal

build his mall on some like
geological phenomenon

Mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down
alongside the abyss

EXT ICTERNIANS QUARRY -- LATER

Further down the path Sam looks to Large He uses an old
mop

handle hes found as a walking stick

As they continue along the path it begins to get continually
THIRTY

mid-

cluttered with rusty junk An old bedframe a porcelain tub
remnants of a Jungle-Gym dirty broken toys
Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a

FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that
sits right on the edge of the cliff Its windows glow warm
and welcoming

Mark stands in front of the boat This isnt what he
expected Rain begins to fall

MARK
I guess this is it

LARGE
So knock Knock and barter for
Dessert Storm Trading Cards

MARY
Please dont tease me about my
hobbies I dont tease you about
being an asshole
They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat Mark
steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull

After a moment ALBERT a very gentle looking man in his

thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears
on the deck He smiles warmly-

ALBERT
(in a whisper)
Mark

MARK
Yeah Are you Albert

ALBERT
(with a smile)
Yes Come on in out of the rain
Sam and Large look at each other then follow Mark up an A-
frame ladder that sits next to the hull

INT ALBERTS BOAT -- CONTINUOUS
They step inside and the door closes behind them Its very

cozy and warm GREAT MUSIC PLAYS A wood burning stove heats

the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING
ROOM

with deep cushy couches

ALBERT
You guys must be freezing Make
yourselves warm by the fire Im
just gonna go put her down Ill be

The three of them huddle by the fire They speak in quiet
whispers

SAM
I must say Ive been continually
impressed today with how each new
place you bring us manages to be
weirder and weirder

MARK
What do you mean this is nice

LARGE
ah nothing just hanging out in an
old boat at the bottom of a quarry
in Newark

MARK
Its hardly the bottom dude Did

Albert returns with FAYE an equally gentle and caring
looking woman in her early thirties

ALBERT

FAYE

private ark Unfortunately if
this is the apocalypse Im not
quite sure it still floats

FAYE
Would any of you like some tea

SAM
Id love some tea
Large and Mark look at her

LARGE
No thanks

MARX

Faye crosses to a small kitchen They all sit there politely
nodding at each other

LARGE
What is it that you do here What
is this place

ALBERT
Good question Were calling it
Kiernans Fault And no ones
really quite sure what it is
because they havent been able to
explore it Theyre locked ina
legal battle over who has the
rights to the land

So one of these days it will either
be a national park or a shopping
mall But while their locked in
litigation I was hired to make
sure no one comes inside

ALBERT
But we think its important

LARGE
Why What do you think youll find

ALBERT
I dont know Its exciting New
frontiers are hard to come by these
days I guess I just like the idea
of discovering something

(MORE )

Doing something completely unique
that no ones ever done before
Large looks to Sam

LARGE
Yeah Alberts Abyss

ALBERT
Who knows Maybe But I used to
think that was all that mattered
No matter what it was as long as I
could put my name on it Like it
would somehow justify the fact that
I lived that I was here I did
that Thats mine I got this plate
on my travels But you know what
Thats all ego none of that stuff
really matters If at the end of
the day I get to be with her if I
get to be with this person right
here and the baby we created then
thats all I need Just having

felt that If I die in an hour I
know Ive lived

Faye kisses his forehead

LARGE
You know my whole life Ive had
that same anxiety that if I didnt
discover something or save
something or

SAM
Save something from being
discovered

LARGE

Yeah That Ill have somehow wasted
my time here And that somewhere
whatever force created us would
resent me for it

ALBERT
Well I think that force would
rather remind you that breathings
all it takes to be a miracle
He takes a deep breath Large Sam and mark stare at Albert
TRANSFIXED Hes like a sage

GREAT MUSIC BEGINS

ALBERT
Well i suppose you want what you
came all the way down here for

MARX
Yeah that would be great
doorway

ALBERT
It took me awhile to track this
piece down But I owe Diego huge
He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to
Mark Mark looks inside and nods his head

MARK

Sarah Largeman drowned cross-legged facing each other

She finds a clear plastic cup

I think so I dont feel any more

SAM

SAM
This was a good idea Keep talking

LARGE
Its funny this thing reminds me
of this really random memory of my
mother Its so weird I havent
thought about this in so long but
this great memory I have where I
was a little kid and I was crying
for one reason or another and she
was kind of holding me and rocking
me back and forth And I could see
the little balls in this thing just
rolling back and forth And there
was just snot dripping down my
nose

(HE LAUGHS)
And she just handed me her sleeve
and told me to just blow my nose
into it And I remember thinking
even as a very little kid Wow
This is love

More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes

to stifle them with a LAUGH He cradles the pendant

LARGE (CONTD)
This is love And it just felt

He
so good to be there So safe

And I didnt feel safe very often

but at that moment

Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sams She
holds the plastic cup in her hand

SAM
oh Large Im never gonna be able
to get all these
They laugh She moves closer wrapping her legs around his
waist to hug him close She kisses his-wet cheeks

SAM (CONTD)
Im never gonna be able to get all
these am I

LARGE
Its so funny isnt it But I
think thats the single most
amazing moment I remember of my
Mother Cause she wasnt sad and
she wasnt being prodded to be
happy she was just there

SAM
To be your Mom

He node and tightens his lips trying to hold in the faucet
that his eyes have become a monumental release He almost
looks like a different person They stare directly into each
others eyes He turns away its too vulnerable a place for
Nim

SAM (CONTD)
Look at me

(BEAT)
Look at me

reading

LARGE
Ive been on a pretty crazy little
journey these last couple of days

GIDEON
Youve been avoiding me

LARGE
No I just maybe I have been

GIDEON
Im sure you can find plenty of
things in your life to be angry
about but what I dont understand
is why youre so angry at me All I
ever wanted was for everybody to be
happy again Andrew Thats all I
ever wanted

LARGE
But when were we ever all happy
Dad I mean you always say that
but when was that When was this
time that you have in your mind
that you wish we could all get back
to Cause I dont have it in my
memory Maybe if I did I could help
steer us back there But we
should

(BEAT)
You know you and I need to work
on being okay if thats not in the
cards for us

GIDEON
Well we might have a shot at it if
you could just forgive yourself for
what you did

LARGE
What I did What I did You know
what Dad Im gonna forgive myself
for what I did right now I was a
little boy and somebody made a
shitty latch Thats what I think
now And Im not gonna I mean
Im not gonna take all those drugs
anymore Because theyve left me
completely numb I have felt so
fucking numb to everything I have
experienced in my life And for
that Im here to forgive you
Gideon site up against the headboard

LARGE (CONTD)

Youve always said you wanted us to
have whatever it is we wanted

Well maybe what Mom wanted more
than anything was for it to all be
over And for me what I really
want more than anything is for it
to be okay with you for me to feel
something again even if its pain

GIDEON
Going against your doctors
recommendation thats a pretty
weighty experiment to take on dont
you think

LARGE
(with a chuckle)
This is my life Dad This is it
Ive spent twenty-six years waiting
for something else to start So no
I dont think its too much to take
on Because its everything there
is

(BEAT)
I see now its all there is

GIDEON
Perhaps the great tragedy of my
life will be that you both
deserved more than I knew how to
give

LARGE
We deserved nothing more than you
And you deserved nothing more than
us
Large puts his hand on the center of his fathers bare
chest
LARGE (CONTD)
You and I are gonna be okay You
