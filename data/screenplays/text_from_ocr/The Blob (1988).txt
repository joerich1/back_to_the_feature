Earth looms up slowly filling the screen The North
American continent reveals itself as we DISSOLVE CLOSER

The west coast of the United States rises toward us
Mountains rivers and major cities become distinct as we
DISSOLVE CLOSER through drifting clouds

EXT - MORGAN CITY - DAY

Morgan City is a small community a modest would-be ski town
in the off season nestled at the base of a mountain Its got
its own high school and a factory that is grimly hanging on
despite production slowdowns and lay-offs

VARIOUS ANGLES of the town make us uneasy The streets seem
deserteddesolate

oea hot restless breeze blows a tattered newspaper down
Main Streetleaves skitter across the pavementa wary cat
slinks under parked cars

-Dut there are no people Something seems to be terribly
wrong in Morgan City We soon begin to hear a DISTANT
ROARINGthe SOUND OF A CHEERING CROWD

CUT TO
EXT - HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

MEG PENNY leaps up into frame a blur of pom-poms and chestnut
hair as she leads the pep squad in a cheer The banner-waving
crowd is going wild

Most of the town has turned out for the game The Morgan High
Hawks are battling the Banning Raccoons in a grueling play-off

PLAYERS BENCH

PAUL TYLER and SCOTT JESKEY sit on the bench battered and
streaked with sweat and dirt waiting to go back in Paul is
clean-cut and unassuming a natural athlete Scott is small
and something of a smartass What he lacks as an athlete he
makes up for by being obnoxious

Scott takes a squeeze bottle of water from an ice che
rubs it across his forehead Paul is watching Meg int

Paul and Scott grab their helmets and rush out onto the field
ANOTHER ANGLE

The teams take their places at the scrimmage line They paw

at the ground glaring at one another tension mounting as the
Hawks’ QUARTERBACK takes his position

QUARTERBACK
Hut one Hut two

‘The ball is snapped Bodies slam against bodies as the quarter-
back falls back poised to throw looking for a clear man

reaks free from the pack running into the open

Throws long pass to Paul

THE BALL

It spirals through the air floating like a dream
PAUL

Runningrunningarms stretching up toward the ball He
leaps high into the air making a perfect catch in his
cradled arms Pure poetry

ANOTHER ANGLE

Out of nowhere five monstrous guys from the opposing team
slam into him like an express train driving him out of bounds
to crash onto a table on the sidelines Cheerleaders scatter
as the table collapses in an explosion of Gatorade
clipboards and towels

The five brutes in no particular hurry pick themselves off
of Paul and saunter back onto the field Paul is left lying in
the wreckage like road-kill Meg looks down at him horrified

PAUL
(wheezing his wind
knocked out
Say Megdo you have any plans
this evening

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - SAME TIME

BRIAN FLAGG eases back in the worn seat of his rebuilt 1958
Indian motorcycle listening to the DISTANT CHEERING OF THE
FOOTBALL CROWD Brian is 17 but has a dark quiet intensity
that makes him seem older than his years He wears a two-tone
40s thrift store jacket over his T-shirt worn blue jeans
crepe-soled rockabilly shoes and a tiny metal stud in one
ear Not your standard wardrobe in Morgan City USA

There is a Morgan High book bag strapped to the back of his
bike He pulls a beer from the bag pops the top and takes a
long sip contemplating the deep narrow gully before him

The dried-out riverbed was once spanned by a wooden bridge
but all that remains is a short section cof rotted timbers
extending out into mid-air

Brian starts the bike then proceeds in a lazy 1

ANGLE ON THE WOODS

A grizzled old man emerges from the woods dragging a plastic
garbage bag bulging with aluminum cans He is accompanied by
an equally grizzled old dog The CAN MAN pauses catching

sight of Brian

BRIAN

takes a last swig of beer and tosses the can aside Once
again a DISTANT CHEER rises up He comes to a decision and
guns his bike heading back across the field

ANOTHER ANGLE

Brian comes to a stop skidding around to face the ruin

THE CAN MAN

He grins toothlessly Sensing one hell of a floorshow he
scurries closer and makes himself comfortable on a log

BRIAN

Unaware of the old man concentration totally focused on the
jump He works the throttle revving the engine higher and
higher

INSERT FOOTBALL GAME CROWD

The CHEERLEADERS are leading the crowd in a “freight train
cheer accelerating the tempo

BRIAN

The CHEER CONTINUES BUILDING as he works himself up toward
the moment of truth Then

CLOSEUP ON his foot jamming the bike into gear

Lurching toward the remains of the bridge

INSERT - CROWD - TIGHTER

Chanting faster and faster

BRIAN

hits the brakes The bike skids kicking up dust as it veers
to the side He digs his heel into the ground fighting his

momentum as he reaches the lip of the gully

f0r an endless moment he just hangs teetering at the very
edge fighting for balance

then both bike and rider go over the side fallingsliding
down the incline to land in a crumpled heap at the bottom

INSERT - CROWD

EXPLODING INTO APPLAUSE as the “freight train climaxes

GULLY CLOSE ON BRIAN

CHEERING CONTINUES OVER Brian lies flat on his back in a thin
trickle of muddy water his battered motorcycle on top of him

He groans and begins to wriggle out from under the bike

He now hears a PAIR OF HANDS CLAPPING and looks up shielding
his eyes against the sun

BRIANS POV

The Can Man sits on the lip of the gully above wheezing
gleefully and applauding

ANOTHER ANGLE

Brian settles back sighing The old man rises and picks up
Brians discarded beer can polishing it with his sleeve as if
it were a great prize He puts it in the garbage bag with the
other cans then walks away

A mob of babbling kids crowd around the counter as she
finishes scribbling Herbs check tears it off and hands it
to him Without another word she turns to start taking
orders

EXT - MAIN STREET - DAY
An old pickup truck pulls to a stop near the diner Brian hops
out of the back of the truck and waves his thanks as it pulls
away He starts up the street but spots Herb exiting the
diner and getting into his police cruiser

Brian fades back into a storefront as Herb starts his car Its
clear Brian would prefer avoiding him

The cruiser approaches but instead of gliding past it comes
to a stop right in front of Brian Herb rolis the window down

HERB

on the lip of a flatbed snowmaker He tosses one to Brian

MOSS

MOSS

Brian quickly gathers up the ratchet set rolling it into its
cloth sleeve and pocketing it

BRIAN

EXT - FOREST CLEARING - DUSK
CLOSE ANGLE on a low tree stump A gnarled hand is placing
Brians discarded beer can in a careful grouping with three
others ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the Can Man studiously inspec-
ting this arrangement in the waning light His decrepit shack
stands nearby the mangy dog lying listlessly on the porch
The Can Man slowly raises his foot A large rusty iron ski

illet
is strapped to his boot like a Medieval snowshoe With a sudden
ery he stamps down on the stump flattening the cans

ifts his foot to study his handiwork He chuckles
ring softly to himself

CAN MAN
Good ‘un

He tosses the flattened cans into the large wire basket of an
old scale which is already half-filled with crushed cans As
he grabs two fresh cans and sets them on the stump he pauses
noticing his dog

THE DOG

rising to its feet staring at the sky growling softly

THE CAN MAN

starts to hear a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE GROWING LOUDER He
looks up

THE SKY

The first stars have appeared in the brilliant cobalt-blue
evening skybut one star seems to be growing steadily larger

THE CAN MAN

gazing up in wonder as light shines on his facegetting
brighter

LOW ANGLE WIDE

The WHINE BECOMES A ROAR and the old man hurls himself to the
ground as a flaming meteorite streaks directly over the cabin
There is a flash of light and a DEAFENING BLAST as it crashes
somewhere deep in the woods

The dog goes crazy and charges off into the forest in the
direction of the crash The Can Man scrambles to his feet
hobbling around with the skillet still strapped on

He wrestles the skillet off his foot and starts toward the
woodsbut pauses turning back He goes to the porch and
grabs a rusty hand-axe Now properly armed he sets out

Shaking his head Paul digs a five dollar bill out his pocket

PAUL

Scott grabs the money and hurries up the aisle leaving Paul
to browse the magazines

ANOTHER ANGLE

Scott steps up to the counter The PHARMACIST is a surly man
with a neatly trimmed moustache

SCOTT
Hey pal gimme a pack of Trojans
and a Binaca spray

The pharmacist considers it for a moment -- hed just as soon
kick Scott out as serve him He finally turns away to gather
the order Scott waits drumming his fingers on the countertop
Suddenly REVEREND MEEKER the loca Lutheran minister looms
upfrom behind and places a box of Contac on the counter
Meeker balding and cherubic gives Scott a pleasant smile

REV MEEKER

preacher hovering at his elbow

scott
Ribbed I guess Theyre not really

REV MEEKER

The pharmacist and the preacher peer down the aisle toward
Paul who is casually paging through a car magazine

PHARMACIST

PHARMACIST

As Scott hands over the money Paul hollers up the aisle

PAUL
(impatiently)
Cimon Whats the holdup I dont
Want to keep her waiting

Scott shrugs to the preacher and the pharmacist as if to say
see what I have to put up with

PHARMACIST
(muttering)
That boy doesn‘t need condoms He
needs a muzzle

CUT TO
EXT - FOREST - NIGHT

The Can Man slowly rises from the undergrowth his awed
features bathed in an eerie light

Before him a smouldering nine-foot crater casts an unearhtly
glow on the surrounding tangle of trees deep in the forest

Bluegreen flames dance along the craters rim like faerie
lights slowly dying out as brackish smoke funnels into the
night sky Shattered trees trunks and scorched earth mark the
objects descent

The Can Man gathers his courage and approaches the gaping
hole brandishing his axe His dog slinks along beside him

The old man pauses at the rim of the crater wavering between

cowardice and curiosity He finally kneels and gazes down into
the hole shying from the heat and swirling smoke

HIS POV

We sense movement a strange pulsing just beneath the molten
surface

THE DOG
cringes back whimperingthen runs off
THE CAN MAN

grabs a fallen branch and extends it down into the smoking
core of the crater giving it a tentative poke

There is a gentle tug on the stick like the nibble of a
trout

He slowly pulls the stick out Clinging to the end of it is a
weird gelatinous mass about the size of a fist Its
transparent surface steams and sparkles in the craters glow

Though the stick is pointed down the mass does not drip off
Instead it seems to flex and draw into itself

The old man steps back uttering a soft gasp of wonder He
turns the stick this way and that admiring his discovery
fascinated

CLOSEUP - HIS HAND

Suddenly the mass shoots up the length of the stick like a
striking cobra engulfing his hand to the wrist

He crouches down and opens Moss ratchet set He selects one
and starts working patiently trying to fit the drive chain
back into place by the light of the moon

Suddenly he hears a SOFT RUSTLING SOUND He jerks his head
around trying to identify the noise

But there is now only silence He must have imagined it He
goes back to work

More RUSTLING The CRACK OF A TWIG Brian stands up and peers
into the darkness holding his breath as he listens

He slips the ratchet into his back pocket clicks the

Still SCREAMING eyes rolling in agony --

revealing the thick oozing mass that is slowly eating his

As he feeds quarters into the machine he glances up the
hospital corridor

PAULS POV

There is a partially open door at the far end of the corridor
Through it Paul can see the Can Man lying unattended on the
gurney seemingly unconscious The doctor still hasnt gotten
around to him

Suddenly there is subtle movement beneath the blanket
covering the Can Man

pauses by an examination room glancing in The DOCTOR is

PAULS POV - THROUGH THE HALF-OPEN DOOR

The Can Man lies on the gurney his head turned away There

is now more pronounced movement under the blanket -- a heaving
motion

CLOSER

The old mans head lolls toward us revealing a corpse-like
face A bloody froth bubbles up from within his gaping mouth
with a gruesome GURGLING SOUND

PAUL

Reacts horrified He turns and charges into the examination
room The doctor looks up irritated by the intrusion

PAUL
Doctor you gotta come right away

DOCTOR
Im with a patient here

PAUL
Theres a man dying Please

Paul drags him into the hallway

Paul and the doctor enter The Can Man lies motionless There
is no sound no movement

DOCTOR
Is this the hand injury

Paul nods pale The doctor pulls back the blanket and --
‘CLOSER

The Can Man is dissolved from the chest down the bare bones
of his ribcage frame the soupy remains of internal organs his

exposed spine ends in a nondescript lump of bone that was once
his pelvis The rest is nothing but steaming grue

Paul and the doctor are aghast Paul staggers back his mind
reeling He can’t tear his eyes off the corpse

Paul hurries down the hall passing the nurse as she rushes to
join the doctor Paul is looking right and left still on

HIS POV

Paul enters cautiously looking around The room is sterile
and featureless The only illumination is a simple hanging

lamp which casts a pool of light onto the desk with the phone

The room seems empty Paul goes to the desk sits down and
starts dialing

shadowy glimpse of a large pulsing gelatinous mass slithering
silently up the wall disappearing from sight

The Blob contracts around its flailing prey as it drags him
across the room toward an open window

Paul desperately reaches out toward Meg with one arm that has
remained free of the writhing organism

She grabs his hand pulling for all shes worth getting
dragged across the room with him

Suddeniy the arm comes off -- Meg fails back slamming against
a wall The twitching arm lands at her feet

A pair of plastic-gloved hands yank him roughly from his
hiding place and whirl him around - he finds himself staring
into the faceplate of a hostile SOLDIER

SOLDIER
What do you think youre doing

TRIMBLE

turns toward the commotion

BRIAN

Struggling in the soldiers grip he glances at Trimble
TRIMBLE

glaring as his eyes lock with Brians

BRIAN

Whirls back cracking the soldiers faceplate wide open with
Moss ratchet The soldier staggers back SCREAMING as his

hands go to his bloodied face Brian takes off through the
bushes running for his life
TRIMBLE

TO ESCAPE STOP HIM AT ALL COSTS
BEFORE HE REACHES A POPULATED AREA
SHOOT TO KILL

Brian gazes longingly ahead at the road leading to freedom

He looks back toward town torn between going back and getting
away He finally makes his decision and churns the bike
around in a tight turn

A searchlight plays across the ground as a helicopter sweeps
overhead Brian guns the engine accelerating across the
field

SOLDIERS

Running from the trees letting loose their attack dogs The
animals take off after Brian in a barking frenzy

CHATTERING bursts of M-16 fire light up the night

BRIAN MOVING SHOT

He bounces over the rutted field as the ferocious dog pack
closes in from behind snarling and snapping He opens the
throttle leaving them in the dust

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Brian flies along the ridge of the riverbed jeeps appear
at the far end of the field cutting him off

He slams on his brakes and throws the bike into a wild turn
heading in the other direction -- but headlights are coming
from that side as well

Brian churns around in a wide circle Hes being surrounded
on all sides He comes to a stop

CLOSE ON BRIAN

He looks around frantic-- he has a few seconds left at most

forward

BRIAN MOVING SHOT

Flying across the open ground hair and jacket whipping in the

The dog pack swings in from behind snapping at his heels

BRIANS POV

Accelerating toward the bridge at hair-raising speed

BRIAN - MOVING SHOT

He throws the throttle wideand the engine sputters Just
as it did before The bike loses speed and the dogs gain a

precious few feet

Brian fiddles desperately with the fuel line pleading

BRIAN
Not now Please

SOLDIERS

Pouring from their vehicles One raises his M-16 and fires
off a BURST

BRIAN MOVING

A high-velocity Slug SPANGS through his rearview mirror
smashing it to splinters The dogs are now running alongside
snapping at his legs

The bike SPUTTERS again

BRIAN
CMON CMON

Enraged Brian gives it a tremendous kick

Suddenly the ENGINE SCREAMS and the bike rockets forward so
fast that all Brian can do is hang on for dear life

BRIAN (cont)
WHOOOQOAAAAA

The bike hits the ramp and flies inte space trailing ioose
timbers and debris The dogs jam up on the section of bridge
as they come to a hasty stop

BRIAN AND HIS BIKE

Soaring through the air like a bird highlighted in the glare
of the helicopters spotlight

ANOTHER ANGLE

He hits the ground on the other side of the gully with a
jarring CRUNCH but manages to maintain control of the bike
He roars off into the night flipping his middle finger over
his shoulder

The helicopter sweeps into frame overhead spotlight searching
the trees

EXT - AQUEDUCT - NIGHT

A concrete riverbed runs along the edge of town carrying
water run-off from the nearby mountains At this time of year
the water flow is a mere trickle

Brian and his bike bounce over the lip of the aqueduct and
race down the incline to the bottom slipping and sliding

He heads for the mouth of a large maintenance tunnel set into
the wall of the aqueduct like a dark cave

The helicopter cruises in the distance searchlight probing
tt banks into a steep turn heading this way Brian lays his
bike down into a marshy growth of reeds as the spotlight
sweeps dangerously near

CLOSER - BRIAN

Pressing himself into the ground as the craft swoops overhead
kicking up a hurricane It continues past still searching

Brian rises slowly watching it go Beat He turns to the
tunnel peering into pitch darkness

CUT TO

INT —- SEWERS - NIGHT
A larger chamber where tunnels intersect The floor of the
chamber is a lake of murky bilious water A concrete
spill-off ramp angles from the water at one end of the chamber
Meg Kevin and Eddie enter their eyes immediately drawn by a
shaft of light (from a streetlamp) spilling down through an
open storm drain above A series of cross-braced pipes thrust
from the water and run up the far wall to the storm drain
Meg points to the storm drain

MEG
Cmon Thats our way out

They wade into the rancid waist-deep water and start across
the chamber Meg hears a SOFT SQUEALING and peers through the
darkness around her

MEG
Ugh Watch out for that rat

CLOSE ON RAT

The paddling rat is suddenly yanked underwater
FAVORING KEVIN

He looks around uneasily trying to spot the rat

KEVIN

Meg looks back but the rat is gone She peers around
suspiciously growing more and more uneasy as they press on
A SOFT SQUEAL draws her attention

HER POV

Another rat drifts nearby clinging to a floating piece of
garbage Suddenly the rat is sucked under garbage-raft and
all

FAVORING MEG

She freezes realizing the Blob is near She turns to the
boys her voice rising in panic

MEG
Cmon Hurry

They struggle through the murky water the slippery bottom
slowing them down

An unnatural whirling suction now begins to churn the water up
behind them Something is beneath the surfaceslowly getting
closer

EDDIE
Whats happening

MEG
GO GO

They reach the far wall where the pipes lead up to the storm
drain Meg boosts Kevin up He frantically begins to climb the
slippery pipes

Meg grabs Eddie to send him up next but he’s suddenly ripped
from her grasp by an unseen presence beneath the water and
propelled SCREAMING back across the chamber

Eddie is sucked away Meg dives after him vanishing beneath
the surface

Frozen halfway up the pipes screaming in terror

Meg suddenly breaks the surface gasping for air and looking
around desperately

MEG

Meg backs up toward the pipes still searchingstill hoping
Nothing but silent rippling water around her But then --

Eddie bursts from the water directly in front of her popping
up like some hellish jack-in-the-box his face a twisted
nightmare image encased in slime She SCREAMS

Then he is jerked back under vanishing as suddenly as he
appeared

LOW ANGLE

Meg frantically splashes over to the pipes and begins climbing
up after Kevinas the water in the foreground begins to
swell up rolling off the glistening Blob as it slowly rises
from the muck

MEG AND KEVIN

Climbing frantically Kevin slips a few feet but Meg is there
to catch him

MEG
KEEP GOING

She looks back In the dim subterranean gloom she sees the
Blob slowly rising from the water like some primeval demigod
Even more of the creature is sliding into the water from a
tunnel at the rear of the chamber It has become immense

MEG

(softly)
Oh my God

oo

Hanging on with one hand she shoves Kevin up the last yard to
the storm drain

Kevin wriggles out onto the street to freedom and turns back
to heip her She tries to climb out after him - but doesnt
fit

THE BLOB

Sensing its prey aboverising uptendrils forming and
unwindingslime opening up like a gaping maw

MEG

Struggling desperately trying to squeeze herself through her
shoulders firmly wedged Kevin tugging on her arm with all his
might crying She screams in frustration

Drawn by her shouts the three soldiers rush into the chamber
from a tunnel directly in front of the Blob slogging through
water

Too late Slime erupts around him engulfing him from both
sides like a gigantic venus flytrap

MEG

She reaches the bottom and splashes through the muck toward
the spill-off ramp at the far side of the chamber

THE BLOB

Senses her and turns

MEG

scrambles up the steep ramp -- but slides back down the slimy
moss-covered concrete The Blob churns through the darkness

after her an unstoppable juggernaut

Whining with fear Meg struggles to get up the ramp As if in
a nightmare she continues to lose ground

We hear an engines ROAR growing louder
ANOTHER ANGLE

Like sudden thunder Brian bursts from a tunnel at the top of
the ramp on his motorcycle skidding sideways to a stop He
grabs Megs hand and hauls her onto the back of the bike as
the Blob lashes out missing her by inches He guns it and
roars off

‘INT TUNNEL - MOVING SHOT
Meg laughing and screaming holds onto Brian for dear life as
they rocket down a perfectly round tunnel headlight piercing

the dark He suddenly hits the brakes and comes to a
skittering stopjust inches from a wall

BRIAN

THEIR POV

The tunnel is silent and still No sign of pursuit

But then the Blob begins surging up through slotted vents on
the floor of the tunnel cutting them off It swells up
charging at them in a flailing rage

He churns the bike around pointing straight at the Blob He
revs the engine higher and higher making it SCREAM

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the last instant Brian guides the bike up the curved wall
of the tunnel like a carnival stunt cyclist They roar over
the Blob upside down defying gravity through sheer momentum
and centrifugal force and spiral down the other side of the
curved wall just past the pulsating horror

They keep right on going

CENTRAL CHAMBER

They burst out of the tunnel back into the central chamber and

take a spill - Brian and Meg flip over the handlebars of the
bike and hurtle through the air into the water

CLOSER

They come up gasping for airand find themselves tangled in
the half-dissolved corpse of the sergeant They SCREAM
fighting with it It bobs away sinking out of sight

They splash out of the water and keep running disappearing
into a tunnel Brian is now limping on an injured leg

ANOTHER ANGLE

swivels his gun back at Trimble

BRIGGS

Suddenly a tendril of slime shoots out of the manhole and
flails through the air

CLOSEUP - TRIMBLES FEET

The slime THWACKS around his ankles like a bullwhip and --
WIDER ANGLE

He is drawn into the manhole but gets stuck the M-16
wedged under his arms

The M-16s strap breaks and Trimble is sucked away in the
blink of an eye

their weapons down the manhole the ROAR OF GUNFIRE DEAFENING

Then the concrete beneath their feet begins to tremble
subtly at first then more violently Hargis looks around
bewildered

HARGIS (cont)

I think you pissed it off

Suddenly the Blob shoots straight up out of the manhole into
the night sky shattering the surrounding concrete sucking
soldiers up with it

Hargis and his men are snagged like flies on flypaper kicking
and screaming as they rise on the impossibly huge pillar of
slime

HARGIS
is sticking out of the Blob from the waist up M-16 blazing
screaming in rage as he rides the thing up into the air

Defiant to the end he rips pins from the grenades strapped
across his chest as he is sucked into the morass

Like a gigantic whale surfacing the Blob slams back down
buckling the concrete of the street tilting streetlamps at
crazy angles Some short out others flicker wildly

Hargis grenades go off inside the creature in rapid
succession lighting up the beast from withinto no effect

stumble to solid ground at the edge of the street

cab GROANS and buckles as the Blob begins to squeeze

EXT - STREET - MEG

She runs toward the fallen truck The cab is now totally
engulfed in the pulsating creature

Meg pauses by the wreckage of the tanker section her mind
racing The body of a fallen soldier is beside her dissolved
below the hips He still holds his M-16 in a death grip A
satchel charge is attached to his ammo belt

Meg hastily peels back the corpses fingers She grabs the
M-16 and slings the satchel charge over her shoulder

TOWN HALL

Moss Megs father and a few other brave souls kick the
remains of the barricade aside and run out

MR PENNY
MEG COME BACK

INT - CAB
Brian drops to the ceiling of the cab There is a SQUEAL OF
RENDING METAL and the cab buckles violently as if caught in a

car crusher Bare metal smacks against Brians head knocking
him unconscious The windshield spiderwebs with cracks

EXT - STREET

Meg runs out into the open with the M-16 SCREAMING WITH FEAR
AND RAGE as she pulls the trigger The weapon sprays wildly in
her arms almost knocking her over

THE BLOB

Bullets patter across its gelatinous surface

LOW ANGLE MEG

Standing her ground before the creature she screams at the
top of her lungs

MEG
COME ON YOU PILE OF SHIT

She lets loose another volley her entire body rattling from
the recoil

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Blob slowly shifts its massive bulk an inquisitive head
swiveling in Megs direction

She fires another BURST and leaps aside as the Blob lashes a
tendril at her She rolls to her feet beside the tanker and
scrambles up on it

MEG
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT CMON

She empties the rest of the clip at the beast from her
position on the tanker

THE BLOB
releases the cab and starts toward her
INT - TRUCK CAB

Brian still dazed and bleeding looks up through the cracked
windshield as the huge creature withdraws

EXT - MEG - ON THE TANKER
She tosses the M-16 aside then wedges the satchel charge
between the two massive tanks of liquid nitrogen She pauses
taking a last look at the charging monstrosity

MEG

(softly)
Come to Mama fucker

She pulis the ripcord and leaps from the tanker -

-- but her boot snags on a piece of twisted metal and she
flips upside down slamming back against the tankers hull

CLOSEUP - MEGS BOOT

A ragged strip of metal poking through the Material the heel
wedged firmly between two regulator valves

MEG

Dangling upside down desperately pulling at her trapped
boot--

MOSS AND MEGS FATHER
Running to help Meg -- but theyre too far away
MEG

straining to reach the ticking satchel chargeits just
beyond her grasp

THE BLOB

Looming up over the tanker like an angry mountain its bulk
glistening in the nightmarish flickering of the streetlamps

THE SATCHEL CHARGE

Tickingticking

MEG

Struggling Seconds to go Doomed

Brian bursts up throws his arms tightly around her and
lunges away -- her bleeding foot pops right out of the boot -
they hit the ground and scramble away as --

WIDER

-- the Blob rolls over the tanker Meg and Brian run legs
pumping as they cover precious yards --

a DEAFENING EXPLOSION Meg and Brian are hurled forward by
the ground-ripping blast of frost water and ice

MAIN STREET

An icy cloud blossoms rising into the air

EXT - TOWN HALL

Megs mother brother and the rest of the populace are
emerging from the building

REVERSE ANGLE

The Blob lies in the middle of Main Street now reduced to a
great pile of jagged sparkling erystals of ice

TOWNS PEOPLE

Everybody looks up in amazement as a beautiful gentle snow
begins to fall from the mist hanging over the street

FAVORING MEG

She and Brian lie motionless a short distance from each other
on the iced-over pavement bodies covered in frost

Meg slowly begins to stir

MEG
(dazed)
Brian

Moss and her father reach her helping her up

MEG (CONT )
BRIAN

Long beat Brian rolls over and sits up groaning He gazes up
at the remains of the Blob

BRIAN
(softly)
Whoa What a rush

Brian and Meg sweep into each others arms laughing and
crying at the same time

They share a long kiss then gaze up at the last of the
magically swirling snow caused by the explosion

MOSS
(to Brian)
Hey man Told you wed get snow
(beat)
You gotta have faith

Brian and Moss grin slowly at each other ANGLE BEGINS

WIDENING as Moss turns to inspect the wreckage of the truck
He kicks a tire

MOSS (cont)
(muttering)
I wonder if Im covered for this
sort of thing

ANGLES CONTINUES WIDENING as we CRANE UP SLOWLY for a FINAL
MASTER SHOT More and more people are gathering around Some
of the kids have already started pitching snowballs

FIREMAN
Awright people we got four hours
till the sun comes up Lets get a
bulldozer and a dump truck and get
this thing over to the icehouse

SLOW DISSOLVE TO
EXT FARM LANDS - DAY

CAMERA BOOMING UP over a vast windswept wheatfield in the
rural midwest A large patchwork tent stands near a dusty
crossroads trailing to the flat horizon A number of battered
pickup trucks and rundown cars are parked around the tent

CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY IN as we hear the impassioned rythmic
VOICE of a fire-and-brimstone revivalist preacher

VOICE (from tent)
The will of God is written in the
sky in fingers of flame Wormwood
falls from Heaven consuming sinner
and saint alike

INT - TENT - CLOSEUP ON PREACHER

The preacher is barely recognizable as Reverend Meeker Hes
no longer the cherubic little man who bumped into Scott Jeskey
in the Morgan City pharmacy His eyes have a manic gleam
his hair now long and scraggly is streaked with whitethe
side of his face and neck are runneled furrows of healed scar
tissue from his burn

Drenched in sweat spittle flying he screams and shouts his
sermon voice rising and falling in waves

REV MEEKER (cont )
Woe to the inhabitors of the Earth
and sea for the Final Days are
upon us By the Lords word the
Earth shall be cleansed the
disease burned out and the temples
of the false prophets shall falli

ANOTHER ANGLE

The tent is half-filled with rural folk blacks and whites who
all share one thing in common -- poverty and hard times They

listen to Meekers sermon with an eagerness bordering on joy

muttering “hallelujahs and “amens

REV MEEKER (cont)
Theres no more time for forgivin
No more time for salvation Who
among us shall be raised to Rapture
when Judgement Trump blows
(beat)

ONLY THE FAITHFUL BROTHERS AND
SISTERS ONLY THE FAITHFUL

Reverend Meeker -- now totally spent and near collapse --
turns on his heel and disappears through a canvas flap beside
the stage An overweight young black woman and a rail-thin old
man with an accordion start singing leading the crowd in
when That Day Arrives Sweet Jesus”

INT - INNER ROOM

SINGING CONTINUES 0S as Meeker stands at a small folding
table with his back to camera trembling as he tries to steady
himself On the table are books and other humble belongings A
surplus folding cot sits in the corner He pours a shot of
whiskey with a shaking hand and tosses it down

An ancient black WOMAN silently enters behind him Her
weathered face is a map of hard times her eyes filled with
tearsShe gathers her courage to speak

WOMAN
When Reverend When

Meeker doesnt turn around He takes a long time before
speaking
REV MEEKER
(softly)

intently at something
