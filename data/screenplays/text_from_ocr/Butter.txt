LAURA (VO CONT’D)
Our secret is simple We are the best
Bob carves butter better than anyone
Better than Ned Eaton better than Carol
Ann Stevenson and certainly better than
that girl

The conveyor belt STOPS The cow looks at us quizzically
A machine WHIRLS up and milk begins to flow through clear
tubes
LAURA (V0O CONT’D)
And it used to be that in this country the
best always won
ASSEMBLY LINE —

STICK after STICK of yellow BUTTER floats by on a conveyor
belt We move in on one sad deformed stick of butter

Another WORKER grabs the deformed stick of butter and
throws it in the TRASH

This is DESTINY age 12 She’s adorable

DESTINY (V0)

I saw Mrs Pickler I actually wished
she and Mr Pickler would take me in
The foster people had just put me
with a bunch of families and anyone had
to be better than them

INT MOORE HOME — SAME

Destiny sits at a long wooden table with sixteen identical
blonde kids They look like a cuit

dinosaur bones come from

Destiny scared bulges her eyes

EXT MRSCARMICHAEL’S CONDO — NIGHT

A POLICE OFFICER pushes June Carmichael into the back of a
cruiser while another Police Officer leads Destiny to the

came The Gundersons They were old and
they only took me in so someone would
be home just in case something happened

INT THE GUNDERSON HOME — LATER

Tons of DOILES everywhere MRS GUNDERSON 100 shows

hands Destiny a key

WOMAN
Your room’s still empty

DESTINY
Any word from my mom yet

The woman looks up to Destiny We know the answer and so
does Destiny

Destiny resigned walks down the nondescript hallway
DESTINYS ‘ROOM’ AT THE CENTER — LATER

INT PIONEER HALL — IOWA STATE FAIR — DAY

A grand hall PACKED with ONLOOKERS Thousands of them By
the way people are acting you’d think they’re at the Super
Bowl

A sign above reads
“MASTERY IN BUTTER COMPETTITION”

The hall is lined with several glass-fronted coolers each
housing a sculpture made of pure butter Elvis Presley a
milking cow Harry Potter’s broom Dale Earnhardt Jr
etc

LAURA PICKLER (VO)
As you know my husband Bob is a visionary
in the field of butter artistry Obviously
I’m aware the idea of butter sculpting can
cause people to sneer or snicker but did
you know that more people visited the butter
sculptures at the Iowa State Fair last year
than saw Celine Dion’s farewell tour in Las
Vegas or attended the World Series combined
Of course you didn’t How could you with the
liberal media as biased as it is

A huge CROWD has formed around one sculpture in particular
a life-sized replica of-

LAURA (VO CONT’D)
And yes Bob took home the blue ribbon
again like he had each year for the past
20 years

DA VINCI’S LAST SUPPER - From afar the sculpture looks
ridiculous But as we get closer we see the exquisite
detail of the CHALICE the ROBES that flow right before our
eyes the quiver of fear in Jesus and the slight cock of
Judas’ eyebrow It’s truly a masterpiece

LAURA (VO CONT’D)
The Des Moines Register even called him
‘The King Of Butter’

A FINGER presses the ‘play’ button on an old boom box The
theme from “Rocky” blares A fog machine ramps up A man

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
runs out to greet his public BOB PICKLER - rock star
natural and a god among men

CHEERS The crowd freaks out

LAURA (VO CONT’D)
Guess that kinda’ makes me the queen

AND THEN as the fog parts a woman emerges This is LAURA
PICKLER and her age is none of your business

LAURA (VO CONTD)
We had it all

FLASH BULBS NEWS CAMERAS The crowd is mesmerized by a
smiling Bob and a waving Laura They are Brad and Angelina
of butter

INT CHILDREN’S TRANSITIONAL HOME — SAME
Destiny is in the TV room

ON TV — a NEWSCAST from the Iowa State Fair A REPORTER
interviews Bob and Laura standing beside Bob’s Last Supper
sculpture

LAURA
(to reporter)
Of course the awards are wonderful but
what’s most satisfying to Bob and I
is the attention we bring to our charity
Camp Butter where we help children with
special needs

CLOSE ON Destiny as Laura mouths the words ‘special
needs’ She’s mesmerized as the happy couple laughs Laura
kisses Bob on the cheek Bob kisses her back They’re
amazing

The Clerk looks at her not knowing what to say
DESTINY
(sweetly)

Destiny races out hops on her bike and takes off

INT PIONEER HALL — IOWA STATE FAIR — LATER

Destiny stares at Bob’s Last Supper sculpture She runs her
hands along the glass in awe

She reaches into her white wicker basket and pulls out a
knife and her stick of butter (from 7-11)

And then she begins carving Slow at first Then faster
Then faster Then faster (we just see her face)

CLOSE ON her carved stick of butter It’s an exact
perfect replica of the CHALICE from Bob’s piece It’s
brilliant

LATER —

Bob is surrounded by adoring women He’s like a chubby
diabetic Zac Efron Laura leers at them

LAURA (V0O)
Being the wife of a celebrity I was
used to the way other women could get
around my Bob Less secure women might
get jealous but I never really felt
threatened I mean considering the
competition I didn’t really think I
had anything to worry about-

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
A chunky woman wearing a homemade “I’m a Bob-Head”
sweatshirt and nursing a Slurpee races up to Laura

LAURA
Carol Ann Stevenson Why you look
just amazing

Laura leans down and hugs the poor sad thing CAROL ANN
STEVENSON is star-struck in the presence of Laura

CAROL ANN
You really think so

LAURA
Oh yes I think it’s very brave of
you to wear stirrup pants with your
body type
Carol Ann looks down at her pants insecure

LAURA (VO)
Which brings me to Destiny—

LATER —
Another crowd has formed around Bob The guy is a people
magnet Bob leans down to Destiny and pats her on the head

He studies her tiny butter sculpture of the Chalice

BOB
This could be you up here next year

Destiny smiles

BOB
Quiet one aren’t ya’

Destiny shrugs

BOB
That’s okay John Wayne was quiet too

guy

BOB
I expect to see you here competing next
year Destiny

Bob stands up and pats her on the head She’s kinda’ over
the moon

LAURA (VO)
Destiny I think her parents were a little
presumptuous naming her that don’t you
Say what you will but at least those
people are creative with their names

Laura leers at Destiny arms folded

LAURA (V0O CONTD)

(forced)
Still I wish her the best

Bob leans down to hug Destiny It’s one of those true
heartfelt authentic hugs And maybe just for a second we
catch of glimpse of Laura looking over in dare it be said
awe She hasn’t had a hug like that in years

State Mastery in Butter Committee is on a make-shift stage
in front of a pull-down projection screen We catch him
mid-joke

ORVAL
and so Helen handed me the casserole

sorry but I can believe it’s not butter’

The crowd goes wild
ORVAL

waves apropos of nothing

meat-on-a-stick in his hand

A YOUNGER LAURA with bigger hair and shoulder pads spins
the video recorder around (she’s holding it) and records
herself She seems more lighthearted and less intense

YOUNGER LAURA
Hello posterity How do you like
my new dress

Younger Laura hands the camera to Bob and spins around
showing off her dress She and Bob both laugh

YOUNGER BOB
They better like it It cost me 15
dollars

Younger Laura looks to the camera

YOUNGER LAURA
I’m worth it

Laura smiles as Bob swoops into frame for a peck on the
cheek

- Another man NED EATON speaks to the camera while
carving a sculpture of his own

a Jedi And then he reveals his piece
Fricking Schindler’s List

made of butter shakes his finger at two shamed Nazis Bob
finishes tossing aside his carving tools like in a frenzy

BUTTER FAN WIFE

- Ned Eaton speaks again

NED EATON
- and carving butter is not easy I mean
some of these jokesters come in here with
an ‘I-can-do-that-too attitude’ and I
just shake my head Id say the average male-
the average North American male could carve
maybe a circle or a tree if they’re lucky
A lot of these guys these guys that carve
duck decoys or the ladies that enter their
pies- that’s kid’s stuff But butter
Butters hard because of the consistency
It’s not for lightweights

- Laura speaks She’s in her living room fresh flowers
behind her and the shot is filmed with a soft-focus
Vaseline lens

LAURA

we have from butter into politics I mean
don’t be shocked if you see us in the
governor’s mansion one day This is just
the beginning (BEAT) We help children with
special needs you know

- The Butter Fan speaks again

BUTTER FAN

BOB
Can’t we just-

LAURA
I guess dad was right when he warned me
against marrying someone whose biggest
dream was to be a middle-school principal

BOB
What’s that supposed to mean

LAURA
It means I should’ve taken his advice
and married Boyd Bolton At least he
inherited a successful Ford Dealership

Bob gets up and grabs his coat

BOB
I’m done

LAURA
I doubt Boyd would just give up Bolton
Ford at the drop of a hat

BOB

barring him from next years competition

think it’s best you keep your mouth
shut

success and every failure I watched
him turn 867 sticks of butter into

when two days before State the cooler
broke and half of Baby Jesus’ face
melted off And I am here now in his
darkest hour of need to lift him up and
continue our legacy

Well don’t get me wrong I’m not a
feminist or anything like that but
I just worry about what would happen if
the title and all the power that comes

ETHAN
Do you want me to go in with you

Ethan senses she’s having second thoughts

ETHAN
Don’t tell Jill because she always tells
me to think positive but what I like to
do is this think of all the bad things
that could possibly happen to you if you
enter this contest Like you could die of
a tragic butter overdose or maybe a rabid
grizzly bear is hiding inside the moose lodge
waiting to rip your face off Think of all
that and then ask yourself ‘what’s the worst
that could happen’

DESTINY
There could be a python inside

Or a mass murder who only kills little
girls

Or racist ninjas

to man to man always looking always
searching And one day after I was nearly
beaten to death by a customer who
incidentally I have reason to believe
was Muslim I stumbled into another house
a big welcoming house and met another man
(dramatic leaning into microphone)
And that man was Jesus Christ

The crowd nods especially the judges They’re touched
Brooke stares down Laura I told you it was on hussy

BROOKE
I think my work speaks for itself

Brooke moves aside revealing her crappy sculpture It
pretty much looks like a stick-drawing drawn on a hunk of
butter There are two eyes and a mouth and a giant “A”
drawn on the figure’s chest in red lipstick

BROOKE
I call it My Scarlet Letter and it’s
inspired by a movie starring Demi Moore
Thank you and God bless you
(shouting)
Butter saves

Cheers The crowd is moved Many people nod their heads
Brooke steps down Laura cannot believe people are buying
this shit

Brooke looks over to Bob and mouths the words 600 dollars
NANCY
Well thank you Brooke That was
very inspirational Destiny
Now Destiny takes the podium and pulls out a few rumpled

note cards She’s really shy and nervous but the crowd
sees that’s she’s only 12 and lets out a big adorable sigh

DESTINY
Hi

The crowd GUSHES Laura rolls her eyes

DESTINY

(poised)
My name is Destiny My last name
is either Washington or Wilson The
reason I’m not sure is because the
state of Iowa is not sure You see
I am and have been a foster child
I have been shuttled from home to
to home And while some of my experiences
have been negative most have been
overwhelmingly positive I have seen the
great people of Iowa from Des Moines to
Winnemucca County and I know this to be
true Iowans are the greatest people
ever to walk the face of the Earth

The crowd CHEERS Destiny puts down her note cards She’s
just getting warmed up

DESTINY (CONT’D)
So why then can a 12-year-old black
girl with no family history no money
and no connections stand before you and
dare to think she can win this competition
(BEAT leaning forward dramatic)
Because I dare to dream

The crowd is RAPT

DESTINY (CONT’D)
(increasingly more animated)
It is that same daring that drove the
Pilgrims across the vast dark oceans to
America Why did they risk it
(BEAT)
Because they dared to dream

Seriously people are hanging off every word Some people
have started to tear up

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

DESTINY (CONTD)
And it is the daring of a man named
Abraham Lincoln who moved from a
log house to the White House and
risked both houses to keep this great
nation together Why

(BEAT the crowd repeats with her)
Because he dared to dream

The crowd is on their feet standing in elation

DESTINY (CONTD)
(pointing to her sculpture)
And it was the gumption of a poor
black woman who risked life and
limb partnering with white and black
alike to bring my ancestors to freedom
on the underground railroad Why

DEATINY AND THE CROWD
Because she dared to dream

DESTINY
Why

CROWD
Because she dared to dream

DESTINY
I can’t hear you

CROWD
BECAUSE SHE DARED TO DREAM

DESTINY
And what are we gonna’ do from now
on Iowa We’re gonna’ —

DARE TO DREAM

Destiny smiles Her work here is done

APPLAUSE There’s no way they couldn’t Men are crying all

CLOSE ON LAURA — She’s toast and she knows it Laura is
shaken

NANCY
And last but certainly not least
Laura Pickler Laura come on up

Laura is caught off guard but stumbles up to the milk
crate It does not look good for her now

LAURA
(nervous and horrible)

Family When I think about butter I think
of family Why Because like the thread

of a grandmother’s quilt butter is the
centerpiece of the family dinner and family
in turn is the thread that holds our great
country together Without butter there is
no family and without family there is

no United states of America Thank you

A few polite claps Laura mortified walks back to her
spot

BOB
(whispering)
You did great

LAURA
I was terrible

Laura is fuming Nancy returns to the milk crate

NANCY
Thank you all four of you We have coffee
and donut holes in the back for everyone
while the judges deliberate Thank you

BOB
(whispering to Laura)
I’ve been through this before Just relax
It’s in someone else’s hands now

LAURA
(possessed)
It’s never in someone else’s hands

And then —

LAURA
(loud)
Excuse me —

Laura stands up before the panel of judges She knows this
is her last stand and Laura Pickler is not going down
without a fight She walks over to the milk crate

LAURA (CONTD)
Id like to say a few more words if I
may

The judges look to each other then give her the go-ahead

LAURA (CONT’D)
you know this really hard

And then she begins to cry We don’t quite know if its
heartfelt cry or an ‘I’m going to lose’ cry

LAURA (CONT’D)
Before you cast what may be the most
important vote of your lifetime I’d like
to remind you what this contest is about
It is about ‘excellence in butter’ And
from what I’ve seen in recent days my
faith in this panels commitment to
excellence has been challenged Unless
Im mistaken some people seem to think
this competition is about who is the most
disadvantaged who’s had the hardest life
Who’s had to overcome the most to get here

The judges and the crowd seem skeptical

LAURA (CONT’D))
You know this is exactly why I stopped
watching my American Idol Every year
the best singer gets up there and every
year she gets knocked down by some ghetto
queen with a baby and mug shot Well I’m
sorry that I was born white and tall and

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

LAURA (CONT’D)
pretty I’m sorry I don’t sit in front of
the TV all day inhaling pork rinds and
soiling myself

Laura glances over to Carol Ann who chows down on a bag of
Funyons

LAURA (CONTD)
And I am sorry that I didn’t spend 15
years of my life sucking every cock that
flew in front of my face only to throw on
a cheap church dress and claim to find God

Laura looks to Brooke The crowd is stunned

LAURA (CONT’D)
And Im sorry my ancestors weren’t running
around naked in a field of cotton singing
Amazing Grace

Laura looks to Destiny
LAURA (CONT’D)
And I guess I’m most sorry I spent all my
life working hard and doing the right thing
Because that’s what I thought this competition

was about And I just hope when you vote
you remember that

Laura steps down And guess what She’s got them back

A few people in the crowd are not having it but for the
most part folks are nodding their heads especially the
judges She looks to Brooke and Destiny now who’s on top

LATER —

The crowd mills about enjoying their donut holes and

Yes Some of the judges are of the
opinion that perhaps your work is
not entirely your own

LAURA
And you defended me right

NANCY
Well I — I’m impartial —

LAURA
I assume they showed you proof Where
is it I want to see it

NANCY
Well it was just a sense that some
of them-

LAURA

It was that Miss Dairy heifer wasn’t
it Or that Helen You know she has a
history of lying don’t you

NANCY
No I wasn’t aware of that

Laura moves closer to Nancy

LAURA

‘round Laura puts on her best fake-smile

NANCY (CONT’D)
(looking at a note card)
In fourth place we have Carol Ann
Stevenson

Polite claps but Carol Ann is over the moon

Don’t you think its weird that babies
can’t hold up their heads on their own
I mean think about how fucked up that is
Its like you shouldn’t be allowed to exist
or something if you cant hold up your own
head by yourself Whatever I think everyone
should be forced to have abortions anyways
I mean think about it Is a baby better off
dead or in the suburbs At least you feel
no pain when you’re vacuumed out of some
cooter but in the suburbs you’re forced to live
with some stupid family with stupid people
that call you fat when you are not fat at all
and then you have to deal with stupid boys
like Rob Ackerman who dont call you back
even though you blow them in the backseat of
their Kia’s (BEAT) God I hate people and I
can’t wait ‘til everyone dies from Global
Warming

Kaitlen takes another hit

kidding me right That was 20 years
ago And it’s me for crying out loud

JILL (CONTD)
not her And it’s a protest People
have a right to protest

Laura smiles calmly

LAURA
Well we just don’t know what kind
of thoughts you might be putting into
her head

ETHAN
This is ridiculous

LAURA
I mean she could be using her win
here at county to infiltrate state
with some sort of anti-butter protest

(to Martin Caswell)

And with the media there and everything
I’d say that’s a huge risk for the Land
QO’ Lakes brand

Martin nods Bob lowers his head he’s so embarrassed to be
a part of this Ethan and Jill are livid

MARTIN CASWELL
Obviously we at Land 0’ Lakes share
Ms Pickler’s concerns however we
will take you at your word that some-
thing like this won’t happen at State
You do reject your foster mother’s
actions Destiny don’t you

Destiny looks to Martin and then to Jill And then she
begins to CRY She gets up and runs out of the room

No

DESTINY
I heard Miss Jill By the garage

Did you know that Jill can’t have
babies

DESTINY
Why

ETHAN

Well that’s complicated

DESTINY
Her vagina’s broken

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

ETHAN
I guess you could say that But the
adoption people would ask as over and
over ‘are you sure you don’t want a baby
We can get you a baby You both have good
jobs you have a nice house we can get
you a baby And we made up this whole
thing in our heads that like we wanted
an older child because they always get
overlooked and wed be doing so much
to help the world and society and everything
but the truth is that we’re scared to have
a baby

DESTINY
Why

ETHAN
I don’t know

Destiny pats him on the shoulder

DESTINY
It’s okay to be scared I guess

Destiny stands up

MEETING ROOM-

Jill is about to blow up the whole thing is so retarded
Destiny and Ethan enter

MARTIN CASWELL
So Destiny Do you denounce your foster
mom’s actions

LAURA
(to Destiny)
Denounce means ‘reject’

I know what it means and no Sir I
wont I personally wouldn’t do something

can’t denounce her She can say and do

Boyd Bolton enters and removes his hat Everyone kind of
looks around what

LAURA
Boyd Tell everyone what you told

Boyd looks around He seems nervous

BOYD
On the evening of the 15 Mr Ethan
Emmit approached me and knowing I have
superior skills in the art of sculpting
butter asked if I could help his daughter
Destiny with her entry for the Johnson
County Mastery in Butter contest I said
no at first but then he offered me five
hundred dollars so I snuck in every night
and carved her sculpture for her It
was only after I saw how distraught the
innocent Laura Pickler was that I felt
the need to come forward I can no longer
bear to live with this horrible blight on
my conscience Thank you

Boyd looks up to Laura proud

Laura stands up

LAURA
May I make a suggestion

The judges give her the go ahead Jill and Ethan are about
to rip her head off

LAURA
As it’s clear that Destiny’s win is
in question I think the only fair
solution would be to have a rematch
Me vs Destiny This Saturday Right
here at the Moose lodge

Jill stands up

JILL
Absolutely not Destiny won on her own
fair and square What’s wrong with you
people I can’t believe you will let
this two-bit trophy wife-

This sets off a shouting match of accusations and anger
amidst everyone except Destiny As it escalates Destiny
quietly stands up

DESTINY
I’1l do it

The crowd quiets down

JILL
