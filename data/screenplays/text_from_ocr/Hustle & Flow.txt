The lighter ejects DJay lights a cigarette and speaks to
someone sitting shotgun in his parked car DJay is an
intense looking black man in his thirties

replacing it with his New Orleans herb

With a roll and a lick the two are ready to share a smoke -
the blunt is passed back and forth between DJay’s lips and
Skinny Black’s platinum grin

They laugh together from a separate room of the club
Skinny’s friends continue their party from a distant table

Skinny is now half way through a story that he can barely get
out - a mild case of the giggles

DJay bursts into the bathroom catching his reflection in
the mirror over the two sinks He focuses his eyes chasing
his buzz away

And then an echoed mumble from somewhere in the bathroom It
sounded like an attempt at language but came out as a garble
of slurs and vowels

DJay is cautious more than curious as he opens the only
stall in the bathroom He slowly pushes it open

Skinny Black is passed out on the floor in front of the
toilet with his pants around his knees He is mumbling
incoherently occasionally flinching like a dog having a
nightmare

Something catches DJay’s eye He lets go of Skinny Black
letting him fall to the floor - smack

DJay is stunned He cannot swallow he cannot blink he
cannot look away

He kneels before the toilet looking inside He slowly reaches
into the toilet to retrieve his demo tape

Dripping with piss and God knows what else DJay lifts the
tape out of the toilet The tape from inside the cassette has
been pulled out hanging like a long tangled braid

A rage builds in DJay as he lifts Skinny Black up against
the wall The rage turns to unbearable hurt

removes a silver 45 pistol With another punch from DJay
he drops the gun to the floor

DJay grabs it and pushes the muzzle up against Skinny
