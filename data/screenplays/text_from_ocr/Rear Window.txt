FADE IN
INT JEFFERIES APARTMENT - DAY - LONG SHOT

Although we do not see the foreground window frame we
see
the whole background of a Greenwich Village street

We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and
small

apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next
cross-town

street sharply etched by the morning sun

Some are two stories high others three some have

peaked

roofs others are flat There is a mixture of brick and
wood

and wrought iron in the construction

The apartment buildings have fire escapes the others
do

not

The neighborhood is not a prosperous one but neither
is it

poor It is a practical conventional dwelling place
for

people living on marginal incomes luck -- or hope and
careful

planning

The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat

It has opened windows wide pushed back curtains
blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into
sweltering intimacy Yet people born and bred to life
earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have

to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly

each other except on direct invitation

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of
man fills the screen It is so large that we do not see
features but merely the temple and side of the cheek
which a stream of sweat is running

THE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the
and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall
outside the window It registers 84

THE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open and brings nearer to
room with a large studio window We are able to see
this room A short balding man is standing near the
shaving using a small bowl of water and a portable
which he has set up on a shelf

To the right of him is a battered upright piano On top

the piano is a radio The music selection coming from

radio stops and the announcer is heard

ANNOUNCER
The time -- 715 AM WOR New York

Contented he returns to his shaving

THE CAMERA MOVES ON AND OVER to a far building It

over the face of this building until it comes to fire
It goes up and near enough to one which has become the
bedroom of a couple We are near enough to see an alarm
hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously
rises lazily to a sitting position He gropes to switch
alarm off

We see that his pajamas are stained with sweat In his
position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside
our surprise the head of this other person -- a woman
rises where his feet are They have been sleeping in

directions They sit limply looking at each other with
bedraggled and weary expressions which show they

very little sleep in the heat of the night

THE CAMERA NOW MOVES DOWN toward the left onto another

building It MOVES IN A LITTLE to a living room window
inside the windowsill a small fan is oscillating The

sits on the right side of the table and to the left of
is an automatic toaster

Behind the toaster stands a full-bodied young woman
apparently wearing only a pair of black panties Her

navel and the lower part of her chest are naked Just
her breasts the curtain partly drawn has thrown a
shadow which extends upward hiding her breasts

and head Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster

over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-

She picks up the coffee-maker and swings back to the
to sit down She does this so deftly that her breasts
never exposed but hidden by the fan as she sits down
fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee far
reveal that she wears no bra but not far enough to
the exciting promise of her lack of clothes

THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a distant street corner seen
two buildings The traffic is very light at this hour
Sanitation Department truck moves through the

spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and
the dust down Three little kids in bathing suits run
the truck playing in the water

THE CAMERA MOVES OFF and around to some buildings at
side As it skims this building we see a hand emerge
one of the windows and remove the cover from a

which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside In
cage are two lovebirds -- arguing

THE CAMERA NOW PULLS BACK SWIFTLY and retreats through
open window back into Jefferies apartment We now see
of the sleeping man THE CAMERA GOES IN far enough to

of eagerness in his expression
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT
While Jeff is continuing his phone conversation we see
object of his look Two pretty girls have appeared on
distant roof They are smiling and talking although we
hear their dialogue Each wears a terrycloth robe With
backs to the CAMERA they take off the robes slipping
down over their shoulders slowly Then seductively
turn -- revealing the full beauty of their tanned and
suited bodies It is almost as if they want to be
the center of neighborhood attention They at least
of Jeffs attention Then they spread the robes in
them and lie down on the roof and out of sight Jeff
a little disappointed

revealing leotard and ballet slippers has just turned

from a portable record player She begins the first

interpretive dance alternately munching the bread and

He is now looking at the windows of the apartments

is raising a window with some effort Having

this he turns back into the room and we now see him

a young man and woman who are standing just inside the
doorway He hands a key to the young man and then

brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor

them He gives them a studied but agreeable nod then
departs

We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil
ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit
boy who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old
dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat He takes off
hat and scales it over to a nearby chair Quickly they
in each others arms kissing passionately crushing
girls corsage and pushing her hat back a little They
the boy laughs nervously and takes a furtive glance
toward the corridor He looks back into the room and
her to come out She follows him wonderingly Fora

both are lost from sight When they reappear he is

her in his arms over the threshold He sets her down

shouldnt keep his shades down and

modern

detective He has a sense of humor He lowers the
glasses

and turns to Jeff

DOYLE
You didnt see the killing or the
body How do you know there was a
murder

JEFF
Because everything that mans done
has been suspicious Trips at night
in the rain saws knives trunks
with rope and a wife that isnt
there any more

DOYLE
Ill admit it all has a mysterious
sound -- but is could mean a number

of different things Murder is the
least likely

JEFF
Go ahead Doyle -- tell me hes an
unemployed magician -- amusing the

neighborhood with sleight-of-hand
Doyle paces a little

DOYLE
Its too stupid and obvious a way to
murder -- in full view of fifty
windows -- and then sit over there --
(He points)
-- smoking a cigar -- waiting for
the police to pick him up

JEFF
Well officer -- do your duty

DOYLE
Youve got a lot to lean about
homicide Jeff Morons have committed
murder so shrewdly that it took a
hundred trained police minds to catch
them That salesman wouldnt just
knock off his wife after dinner
toss her in a trunk and put her in
storage

JEFF
Ill bet its been done

DOYLE
Almost everythings been done --
under panic But this is a thousand
to one shot That mans still sitting
around his apartment he isnt
panicked

JEFF
(A pause)
You think I made all this up

DOYLE
I think you saw something -- that
probably has a very simple
explanation

JEFF
For instance

DOYLE

His wife took a trip

JEFF
She -- was -- an -- invalid

DOYLE
You told me

Ive got to run Jeff

JEFF
All right -- you dont believe me

way
Stops

on my own No point in you getting
any ridiculous publicity

if I can find out where

case at hand

tenants Flat statements -- no

hesitation And they all jibed to

for the railroad station

Now how could anybody guess that
They had perhaps signs on their
luggage Grand Central Or Bust

back He said Thorwald told him he
had just put his wife on the train
for the country

A very convenient guy -- this
superintendent Have you checked his
bank deposits lately

Jeff -- huh

JEFF

(Sharply)
Well -- what good is his
information Its a second-hand
version of an unsupported statement
by the murderer himself -- Thorwald
Anybody actually see the wife get on
the train

DOYLE
I hate to remind you -- but this all
started because you said she was
murdered Now did anyone including
you actually see her murdered
JEFF
Doyle -- are you interested in solving
a case or making me look foolish

DOYLE
If possible -- both

JEFF
Well then do a good job of it Get
over there and search Thorwalds
apartment It must be knee-deep in
evidence

DOYLE
I cant do that

JEFF
I mean when he goes out for a paper
or a drink or something What he
doesnt know wont hurt him

DOYLE
I cant do it even if hes gone

JEFF
(With sarcasm)
Whats the matter Does he have a
courtesy card from the police
department

DOYLE
Now dont get me mad Even a detective
cant walk in anybodys apartment
and search it If I were ever caught
in there Id lose my badge inside
of ten minutes

JEFF
Just make sure youre not caught If
you find something youve got a
murderer and nobody will care about
a couple of house rules If you find
nothing -- hes clear

DOYLE
At the risk of sounding stuffy Jeff --
Ill remind you of the Constitution
and the phrase search warrant issued
by a judge who knows the Bill of
Rights verbatim He must ask for
evidence

Give him evidence

She

seems quite animated moving gracefully her skirt and

All day long Ive tried to keep my
mind on work

JEFF
Thinking about Thorwald
LISA
(Nods yes)
And you and you friend Doyle --
(Stops to Jeff)
Did you hear from him again -- since
he left

JEFF
Not a word He was going to check on
the railroad station and the trunk
He must be still on it

As he talks she seems to be thinking something over to
herself He starts pacing trying to distill her

thoughts
We see that she has brought an oversized handbag with
her
which lies prominently on the table
Jeff watches her
JEFF
Something on your mind Lisa
LISA
It doesnt make sense to me
JEFF
What doesnt
LISA
Women arent that unpredictable
JEFF
(Losing a little
patience)
Lisa -- I cant guess what youre
thinking
THE CAMERA CLOSES IN Lisa stops faces him Her eyes
sparkle

and her body is tense with concentration

LISA
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it
always hangs on her bedpost where
she can get at it Then she takes a
trip and leaves it behind Why

JEFF
Because she didnt know she was going
on a trip -- and where she was going
she wouldnt need a handbag

THE CAMERA eases back

LISA
But only her husband would know that
(Starts to pace again)
And the jewelry Women dont keep
all their jewelry in a purse all
tangled getting scratched and twisted

up

JEFF
Do they hide it in their husbands
clothes

LISA

They do not And they dont leave it
behind them A woman going anywhere
but the hospital would always take
makeup perfume and jewelry

JEFF
Inside stuff

LISA
Basic equipment You dont leave it
behind in your husbands drawer in
your favorite handbag

JEFF

Thomas J Doyle has a pat answer for
that

That Mrs Thorwald left at six ayem

JEFF
Thats what the witnesses told him

Well I have a pat rebuttal for Mr
Doyle -- that couldnt be Mrs
Thorwald -- or I dont know women

Still -- those witnesses

Well agree they saw a woman -- but
she wasnt Mrs Thorwald -- That
is yet

She comes over to Jeff He reaches up takes her hand

He pulls her into his lap She puts her arms around
