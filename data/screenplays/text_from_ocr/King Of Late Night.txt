SYLVESTER “PAT” WEAVER 43 creator of the Today Show (and
The Tonight Show) powerful Executive Vice President of NBC
TV and modern programming genius is watching the show on the

Weaver stands behind the show’s director and his crew who sit
in front of a large bank of black and white monitors that
feature each of the different camera shots

TV DIRECTOR
Camera One

The “broadcast” monitor cuts to Garroway and Muggs at the
desk

GARROWAY
(To Fred)
That’s right Fred humans are

silly

(To the camera)
Well be right back after these
commercial messages

TODAY SHOW DIRECTOR
Roll commercial

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
We’re out Back in two minutes

As show goes to commercial the studio explodes into a frenzy
of activity from cameramen make-up people and lighting guys

PAT
Great job guys Somebody get the
monkey another banana Get Dave one
too

Pat walks out of the studio with two junior executives
following along through the halls studio and building

PAT (CONTD)
What were the latest ratings

JUNIOR EXEC 1
THE TODAY SHOW had a forty-five
percent share of the total morning
TV audience last week

JUNIOR EXEC 2
The show is sold out for the next
six months

PAT
Tell the sales team I want it sold
out for the next year

JUNIOR EXEC 2

You get to tell them yourself sir
General Sarnoff would like you to
have dinner with the advertising
sales team tonight

Off Weaver’s sigh

CUT TO

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Pat Weaver and three other men sit in a leather booth the
remains of dinner and lots of cocktails on the table
cigarettes burning in ashtrays and smoke filling the room

NBC AD MAN 1
All we really need Pat are two or
three more hours a day of prime
time so we can sell more ads

PAT
You guys have the easiest job in
the world The sponsors run and own
the shows on the prime time
schedule just like in radio

(MORE)
PAT (CONTD)
You just have to buy them dinner
drinks and get them laid

NBC AD MAN 2
Some of the sponsors are frustrated
Pat

NBC AD MAN 3
Every advertiser wants in on TV
They all think it is the next big
thing but if we don’t get them to
budget annually for a show any
show the money is just going to
get poured right back into radio

NBC AD MAN 2
Or LIFE magazine They just print
more pages when they sell more ads

NBC AD MAN 1
The radio guys are offering long
term discounts for sponsors Pat
Theyre telling them TV is a fad
and our growing pains prove it

PAT

There are only twenty four hours in
a day fellas What do you want me
to do about it

AD MAN 1

You created the TODAY SHOW We need
to know what are you going to do
next

Off Pat’s look of uncertainty

INT PAT’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It’s midnight when Pat comes home from dinner with the sales
team The bells of a grandfather clock sound the late hour

A brand new 1950 Zenith “Saratoga” a fancy mahogany floor
console television set sits in the living room

He turns on the TV and pours a cocktail as the screen warms
up When it’s fully lit the TV screen has a test pattern on
it

Pat squats in front of his TV turning the dial by hand from
station to station looking for something to watch but can’t
find anything but test patterns and static snow

PAT
Seven stations and there’s nothing
on
The glow from the black and white screen provides the only
light in the room as Pat goes over to his couch and sits
drinking and staring at the chosen test pattern when “THE BIG
IDEA” strikes him

Johnny drops a needle on a record and Benny Goodman type Big
Band music starts playing

The station General Manager BOB WILSON 58 pokes his head
into the broadcast booth and yells

BOB WILSON
Hey Carson When did I hire you as
a copywriter Read the ads

Then he pauses smiles at Johnny and speaks in a softer voice
no one else can hear

BOB
That was a funny bit Johnny keep
it up
Bob closes the door and walks away

Off Johnny’s relieved face

JOHNNY
I can’t take all the credit I owe
it all to FDR and the GI Bill

JODY
I told my folks we’d meet them at
the restaurant in an hour

JOHNNY
Perfect

The group is approached by a PROFESSOR 50
PROFESSOR
Pardon the interruption folks

congratulations Johnny

JOHNNY
Thank you Professor
PROFESSOR
You know I was reluctant to
approve your senior thesis topic at
first Comedy Writing on the Radio
isn’t the typical thesis subject
for an American Literature class
but yours was an amazing analysis
of the subject matter I was very
impressed with your thesis Johnny

JOHNNY
Whew That’s good news The deposit
on the graduation cap and gown is
non-refundable

PROFESSOR
Seriously Johnny this is a very
scholarly work Your breakdown of
joke construction and delivery
techniques are amazingly thorough
and I found your definitions and
analysis of ad-libbing very thought
provoking

JOHNNY
Most of the great comics have been
working so long they just remember
a line that fits their needs at the
time

PROFESSOR
With a little more work this is a
paper that could be published by
the University Press and be
received very well by the literary
community You should consider it
and a career in education as well
You would make a great teacher or
university professor

JOHNNY
Thank you sir but people will pay
more to be entertained than
educated

PROFESSOR
You may be right about that You’re
smart Johnny Good luck

The professor shakes Johnny’s hand and walks away

JODY
Maybe you should think about the
teaching job over the summer
JOHNNY
I was going to spend the summer
making a new demo tape and sending
out to radio stations for a job

JODY
You get a lot of free time teaching
college kids

MR CARSON
And a lot of vacation

Bob Wilson approaches the group and shakes Johnny’s hand

BOB WILSON
Congratulations Johnny

JOHNNY
Thanks Bob Thanks for coming

BOB WILSON
I wouldn’t miss it for the world
It’s time for your graduation
present

He hands Johnny an envelope

JOHNNY
Bob you didn’t have to do this

BOB
Just open it

JOHNNY
Okay

Johnny rips open the envelope and pulls out a street map of
Omaha Nebraska Johnny looks confused

BOB WILSON
You’re going to need that map
It’s time for you to start wasting
that degree in a real radio job
college boy A friend of mine runs
W-O-W up in Omaha He needs a full
time morning man I sent him a tape
of your show and the job is yours
if you want it

Johnny is stunned

BOB WILSON (CONTD)
It pays 35 a week and you might
have to sweep up a bit around the
station sometimes

JOHNNY
W-O-W in Omaha Really Thank you
I can’t believe this My own show
In Omaha

BOB WILSON
He needs you to start in two weeks
Can you do it

JOHNNY
Two weeks I could be there in two
days if they needed me

BOB WILSON
Good luck Johnny I’1l miss you
son

Bob walks away and Jody and Johnny parents circle him to
congratulate him

Jody looks a little nervous about this sudden development

MRS CARSON
This is all happening so fast
Graduating college and then moving
away again

MR CARSON
Your Mother is trying to tell you
it’s been nice having you back home
after your time overseas in the
Navy during the war and we both
hoped it might last a little
longer

JOHNNY
I did too

Johnny hugs his Mom

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Omaha is only a phone call away

Jody looks a little left out of the conversation
JOHNNY (CONTD)

Would you two mind waiting a minute
while I talk to Jody

Johnny takes Jody’s hand and walks about ten feet away for a
modicum of privacy in the large crowd

JODY
I understand if you want to break
up This is a great opportunity for
you

JOHNNY
Who said anything about breaking
up I want to be the next Jack
Benny but I want you there beside
me all the way too

Johnny pulls a ring box out of his pocket and opens it
JOHNNY (CONTD)
We should probably get married
before we move to Omaha but I’m
willing to try it the other way if
that’s what you really want
JODY
Oh my gosh (beat) I accept your
proposal I don’t think my parents
will settle for your other option
They hug and kiss each other

JODY (CONTD)
I love you Johnny Carson

JOHNNY
I love you too Today Omaha
tomorrow the world

They turn back to Johnny’s parents to share the good news

late-night network TV show Its
called BROADWAY TONIGHT or THE
TONIGHT SHOW I haven’t decided
yet”

CUT TO

INT PAT WEAVER’S OFFICE - DAY

There are two men sitting in Pat’s office facing Pat across
his desk

The man Pat is asking to be his host STEVE ALLEN 30 is
short with a crew cut and wearing black horn-rimmed
glasses

The man sitting next to him is Steves manager JULES GREEN

GREEN
Will there be anyone watching TV at
eleven PM at night Pat People have
to get up and go to work in the
morning

WEAVER
No one thought there were people
who would watch TV at seven AM but
there are if you give them
something good to watch Thats why
my TODAY SHOW is a hit TONIGHT is
going to do the same for late
night Music comedy skits and talk
Monday through Friday from eleven
PM to one AM

STEVE
I thought it was a hit because of
the monkey Why not do a late night
version of TODAY More news
oriented Are you sure you want a
varietycomedy show

WEAVER
People want to wake up and find out
what happened while they were
sleeping But they want to go to
bed relaxed and happy

JULES
That theory makes a lot of sense
Why are you so hot for the late
night show

WEAVER
The major stations have some pre-
war movies running late at night
but a lot of affiliates go off the
air as early as eleven o’clock

Allen and Green are clearly resisting the idea but Weaver
persists

WEAVER (CONTD)
I have national brands that cant
find airtime in prime time begging
to spend money with us This will
give them a national show they can
buy spot ads on No one sponsor
will control the show like they do
in prime time NBC will own the
show so the sponsors will stay off
your back

ALLEN
So instead of sponsors and a
network on my back all the time
like my radio show I’1l just have
a network on my back

WEAVER
The network will hold guest
approval but Steve I want a show
that can be funny one minute and
then feature an opera or orchestra
A show like this can bring quality
classic entertainment to the
masses Because if we don’t do it
Tv is going to become a wasteland
of quiz shows and soap operas like
radio is now

STEVE
What do you think Jules

JULES
I think Pat is offering you a
tremendous opportunity

Allen thinks for a few seconds before making his decision

ALLEN
Okay Pat If you can make stars out
of Garroway and his chimp you might
be right about late night TV too
But I don’t want you making a
monkey out of me I want to keep
this show smart and sophisticated
just like you said Agreed

Weaver stands and comes around his desk to shake Steve’s
hand

WEAVER
Agreed Welcome to the NBC family
Steve Allen

ALLEN
Glad to be here Pat Work out the
details with Jules

Everyone in television is
enthusiastic for a reason Radio is

Weaver is the smartest guy in the
business

forcing all those NBC actors on
him

WEAVER
We need to promote the prime time

Baruch from YOUR HIT PARADE and

handle the talent if you’re going
to keep my old job TONIGHT is
making a lot of money for the
network so keeping Steve Allen
happy is important

The elevator doors open and the men get on

FRANK
When does that change

WEAVER

Knowing that is the secret TV is
big and it’s going to get bigger so
the stars are going to get bigger
and more powerful We build them up
from nobody into big stars but you
can’t let them get too big or you
lose control

FRANK
I’1l remember that If he gets too
big for his britches do we get rid
of him

Carson

This stops everyone until they see it’s Johnny talking

CBS EXECUTIVE
Youre very funny Johnny and the
production team is trying to make

show was over You know what those
producers were doing to you

JOHNNY

into Milton Berle or Jackie
Gleason They wouldn’t let me be me
or even let me write as much of my
own material as I wanted

JODY
They wanted you to be someone
youre not But something else is
bothering you I can tell What is
it

JOHNNY
My agent dropped me yesterday I’m
scared CBS gave me a huge build up
and it didn’t work Now I’m
television’s biggest failure

JODY
You can always go back to radio or
if we need to we can always go back
to Nebraska

Johnny doesn’t see the look on her face but this is what
Jody really wants

JOHNNY
Going back home means my dream is
over I’m trying to think of this
as a temporary setback

JODY
So what do you want to do

Johnny puts the drink down on the table and lights another
cigarette

JOHNNY
I want to be able to do it my way
I want a new agent and producers
who understand me next time But
they aren’t exactly knocking down
our door right now

JODY
Al Bruno keeps calling you He
wants to manage you

JOHNNY
Al isn’t really an A-list manager
He’s no MCA

JODY
He restarted Jimmy Dean and Dave
Garroway’s careers Maybe he can
restart yours next If he believes
in you like I do then isn’t that
what matters

Johnny and Jody embrace and kiss

JOHNNY
It is I’1l call him and see if
he’s still interested Maybe he has
an answer to the sixty-four

available now

WEAVER
Really Jack Benny’s fair haired
boy He’s funny and a much better
interviewer than Steve ever was

Pat ponders the potential of Paar while all thoughts of
Johnny Carson are forgotten for now

It’s time to face facts Steve
Allen and the success of the
Tonight Show might have been a
thing of its time like catching
lightning in a bottle It might not
work with anyone else Offer Jack
Paar a twenty-four week contract
for TONIGHT

FRANK
Twenty-four weeks We never do
twenty-four week contracts

Pat points to a calendar on the wall

Colonel Parker won’t let him

got drafted we’re going to have to
wait until Uncle Sam is done with
him

ART
You two should go to lunch and get
to know each other You’1l be doing
a lot of promotion together You
guys are the anchors of ABC’s
afternoon programming block along
with the Mickey Mouse Club The
network has everything bet on
daytime since prime-time is a

No pressure huh

Easy for you to say If we fail you
get to blame Fabian

The men laugh

I’1l let you two get to work

Nice meeting you Dick Let’s have

What Oh you got the script for
the network censor

JOHNNY
The censor gets a different script

ART
Shh Not too loud

Art closes the door to his office

ART (CONT’D)
Youve been here less than a day so
I haven’t had the time to walk you
through the process of making the
show yet

JOHNNY
I told you the producers of my CBS
show just told me to “trust them”
and you see how that worked out So
I need to know how it all works and
be more involved this time

Art motions to a chair

ART
Sit down Okay The research staff
searches the city for interesting
people mostly at tourist spots
like Radio City Music Hall and the
Empire State Building

(MORE)

ART (CONTD)
Then they comb through newspapers
and magazines looking for people
with stories with a hook for our
show

Art hands Johnny files of potential guests

ART (CONTD)
When they find someone good they
call Mary Dodd our Associate
Producer She interviews them and
decides if they are quirky enough
to make the show Then she
interviews them and gets all the
good stuff out of them She turns
that over to the writing staff who
generate two scripts one for the
censors

Art reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a script on
blue paper and tosses it Johnny

ART (CONTD)
and a naughtier blue version for
you to “ad-lib” on air That way we
can get away with a lot more We
usually try to book guests three or
four days ahead of the live show

Johnny gets it and likes what he sees in the script

JOHNNY
And since we’re “live” anything can
happen right

ART
That’s right It’s easier to ask
for forgiveness than permission
from a TV network And this is ABC
as long as we get ratings they
don’t care what we do Anything
else

JOHNNY
I know I’m just a game show host
now but I’m going to need the
writing staff to report to me

Art looks concerned

ART
The writers know what they are
doing

JOHNNY
I can tell but I wrote all my own
stuff in radio and for my TV shows
in Omaha and Los Angeles even
before writing for Red If you want
me to be at my best I need them to
understand me but also respect me
as the guy who makes the call
because he is the one who has to
say it

Art thinks for a moment

ART
You are perfect for this format
Talking to regular people going
blue when you can and your “takes”
for the camera are great It’s
classic stuff We get a lot of heat
for being a copy of Groucho Marx’s
YOU BET YOUR LIFE but if anyone can
fill Groucho’s shoes it’s you
Carson Okay the writers report to
you but you guys better push the
envelope

JOHNNY
Art I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship

ART
Damn straight Johnny You’re going
to be a huge star and this show is
going to be a big hit Quite
frankly we both deserve one Do
you want to go get some lunch

JOHNNY
No thanks Art I brought mine I’m
going to eat lunch in my office and
work on the script okay

But a lunch with the new network
president

Jacks having fun with him but Frank doesn’t realize it

FRANK
Jack I need you to understand the
network’s position

JACK
He’s a past guest and I don’t think
there’s anything wrong with talking
about a man I’ve interviewed

FRANK
He’s not just a past guest Jack
He’s Fidel Castro and he’s a
fucking communist working with the
Russians And you’re taking his
side It’s un-American

Some other diners turn to look at the loud voice Frank is
using

JACK
Frank I thought McCarthy was dead
The point is I think Fidel is doing
some good things The “Tractors for
Freedom” program is one of them

FRANK
It looks bad It doesn’t matter if
he has a point you shouldn’t be
promoting it on-air

JACK
I think it does matter and I should
be allowed to say so since it is
my show after all

This sets Frank off

FRANK
That’s just it Jack it’s not
“your” show It’s not even my show
It’s the network’s show NBC owns
the show The network is bigger
than both of us You just work for
the network on the show they own
and you’re very well paid to do so
So if collecting your big paycheck
means not talking about what a
great fucking guy Fidel Castro is
and making NBC look like a network
of pinko sympathizers then I think
you can handle that right Jack

Jack puts his napkin on the table and stands up

JACK
At least I know where I stand

did it He’s the only producer that
ever got me Al He’s under contract

A large wood panel with a chalk outline of a cowboy on it is
brought out and placed about twelve feet away from Ames and
Johnny as a target

AMES
The secret is to control the
rotation of the tomahawk so it goes
around only once

Ames throws the tomahawk across the stage

The tomahawk hits the chalk outline right in the groin
sticking in the wood with the handle pointing upward in a

phallic image

There is a very long burst of laughter from the studio
audience

Ames is mortified by the accidental placement

Ames starts toward the target to retrieve the tomahawk but
Carson quickly and casually hooks his arm and stops him

Ames gets a quick look from Johnny that says “Relax it’s
okay follow my lead”

Johnny casually sharpens the blades of the two tomahawks on
each other as he patiently waits allowing the classic moment
to be milked for its full potential

Just as the audience laughter is dying down Johnny speaks

JOHNNY
Ed I didnt know you were Jewish

The audience roars with laughter again

Ames cracks up on the stage and Johnny looks straight into
the TV camera

JOHNNY (CONT’D)
Welcome to Frontier Bris

More laughter
Ames motions to the target and Johnny’s tomahawks

AMES
Would you like to try it

JOHNNY
Why not I cant hurt him any more
than you did

Off the audiences continuing laughter

JOHNNY
Where do we stand contractually
This is wrong They aren’t supposed
to rerun any show without the show

Oh yeah they are violating the
contract right now They are going
to have to pay you an arm and a leg
for this John

JOHNNY
That’s it They think they can just
piss on me and I have to take the
fee and cash the check

They’re a network John it’s always
about money at the end of the day

THOMAS
NBC has been running the program’s
reruns for over a week now

(MORE)

THOMAS (CONTD)

The license fees will have to be
paid along with any penalty but it
is our legal opinion that you could
move to void this contract and it
would be upheld by the court

AL
So we could renegotiate with NBC

THOMAS
That could be an option

JOHNNY
What if I wanted to do a new show
on another network

THOMAS
You would be free to do that also

AL
Do you want to leave the Tonight
Show Johnny

JOHNNY
It’s been five years Al I have the
itch to do something else Maybe
prime time or even movies

THOMAS
Gentlemen our legal opinion would
be that you do nothing and make no
decisions right now

AL
Why

THOMAS
If you are to consider
renegotiation as an option there is
some serious due diligence that
needs to be done on what the
Tonight Show is worth to NBC and
how much it makes every year from
the show

JOHNNY
Ha

AL
NBC keeps those numbers in Fort
Knox We’ve done everything we can
to find out

THOMAS
Give us two weeks and we’1ll find
out The network is officially in
breach of contract If the strike
ends Johnny don’t go back to work

staff probably hates me for taking
away their paychecks Even my boys
called me to tell me that the other
kids at school are teasing them
about this
THOMAS
One way or the other it will all be
over soon We’ve found out
everything we need to assess The
Tonight Show’s financial situation

JOHNNY
How Al could never find out
anything

THOMAS
NBC guards the numbers like Fort
Knox just like you said but our
firm does a lot of business with
the Madison Avenue advertising
companies too so I had our people
call around and find out how much
they all spend on your show

JOHNNY
Amazing

THOMAS
Looks likes NBC makes about twenty-
five million dollars a year from
the Tonight Show

JOHNNY
I’m making five hundred thousand
That’s tip money to them

THOMAS
If that It’s a big part of NBC’s
profits every year twenty-five to
thirty percent if our math is
right

JOHNNY
Holy crap

THOMAS
So now we know how much to ask for
if you want to keep doing the
Tonight Show

JOHNNY
How much should we ask

THOMAS
A lot However if you want a prime-
time show the market is very
receptive Every network wants you
and they will let you pick your
show

(MORE)

THOMAS (CONTD)
Late night prime time variety
comedy you name it Now you have
to ask yourself the big question

JOHNNY
Which is

people get leverage like this they
can use it once You need to ask
yourself down deep inside all
your life what is it you really
want
