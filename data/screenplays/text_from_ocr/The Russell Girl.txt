OPENING CREDITS ROLL AS WE FADE IN ON
EXT CHICAGO SKYLINE - SWEEPING AERIAL VIEW - DAY -

The city is gorgeous shimmering under the early summer sun Lake
Michigan sparkles Soldier Field lends a flash of color The Sears
Tower adds a touch of grandeur

As the CAMERA descends we see movement -- millions of people on
their lunch hour Finally on the steps of thé Art Museum we see
one cog in the machine who seems to be motionless deep in
thought

EXT ART MUSEUM - DAY

sitting next to one of the famous lions is SARAH RUSSELL -- 24
years-old and girl next door pretty With dark smudges of
fatigue under her eyes she resembles a delicate china doll up
past her bedtime

She seems to be concentrating on the traffic at this busy
intersection The remains of a half-eaten sack lunch are beside
her

SARAH (VO)
If I had to choose one word to
describe my life it would have to
be random Events dont happen in
a logical progression No rhyme No
reason

Sarah stands She walks down the last two steps throws her trash
away and strides down the street

EXT MARSHALL FIELDS - DAY

Sarah enters the imposing Art Deco building with tastefully-
arranged window displays

INT MARSHALL FIELDS

As she walks past various counters people smile and wave at her
Friendly but not too friendly

SARAH (V0)
In fact I thrive on the surprises
life seems determined to keep
throwing at me For instance though
I graduated from the University of
Chicago at the top of my class I
didnt make it into Harvard Med School
Two years later Im an assistant buyer
at Marshall Fields And I dont even
like to shop
She enters an office and takes a seat at one of the many
identically-functional desks She does paperwork as people begin
to trickle back from lunch

Sarah smiles as various employees greet her but no one engages
her in conversation

SARAH (V0)
I dont have any friends Well

not really
cur To
INT SARAHS APARTMENT - NIGHT
An open plan apartment with hardwood floors -- the living room

kitchen and dining room all share the same space

A too-hip woman with brilliant curly red hair plays a keyboard
The volume is way up Her name is CARLA

SARAH (V0O)
Even my roommate and I We have
more of a truce than a friendship

Sarah comes padding out of a room in her pajamas squinting and
rubbing her eyes

CARLA
Too loud

Though the words imply she may be sorry the tone implies she also
wouldnt mind starting a fight

SARAH
Getting some water

As Sarah fills a glass at the sink Carla turns the volume up a
notch Sarah glances at a clock on the wall Its 130 AM

SARAH (V0)
Carla wonders why I never say
anything Most people would kill
for a roommate like me I think
she assumes Im scolding her for
being too loud by being too quiet

Sarah pads back to her bedroom as Carla digs into a spectacular
solo

INT MARSHALL FIELDS - MARTINES OFFICE DAY

MARTINE Sarahs boss and the very picture of chic sits in a plush
chair watching six-foot-tall models come and go in forma dresses
Sarah sits beside Martine taking notes on her decisions

A Chilean designer named RODRIGO stands nearby giving the details
on each outfit An ASSISTANT runs up and whispers in Rodrigos
ear He is annoyed by the news

RODRIGO
(apologetically
to Martine)

My Mimi she has sickness

Rodrigo eyes Sarah speculatively So does Martine Sarah cringes
cut TO
ON THE MOCK STAGE

Sarah is dressed in a flippy faux-leopard skin coat cream
leggings and knee-high brown suede boots Other models wear fur
jackets wool coats and lycra ski-wear

SARAH (VO)
Martine does not realize how much
this humiliates me She thinks I
get a thrill from playing a poor
mans Cindy Crawford

But Sarah seems resigned to her newest job requirement At
Martines urging she adds a slight burlesque swing to her walk
Martine LAUGHS and applauds

SARAH (V0)
Fur coats in May Its a twisted
business

Getting into it Sarah twirls so the coat swings around Marlo
Thomas-style Suddenly without warning mid-twirl even Sarah
collapses to the stage Unconscious Martine runs up to her

MARTINE
Sarah

Martine dials 911 on her cell phone Rodrigo tsk tsks
RODRIGO

(disapproving)
So unprofessional
Y

Rodrigo comforts the other models who run to his protective arms
as if unconsciousness were contagious

OVER BLACKNESS

‘SARAH (VO)
My mother has an inexplicable fear
of doctors She has never been in
a serious accident or hospitalized
for anything except the birth of
her children Perhaps its the fear
of knowing whats wrong and having
to face it

(beat)
Whether its hereditary or psycho-
logical I have inherited this fear

INT CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - SARAHS ROOM - DAY

Sarah wakes up in a sterile gray room in a stiff white bed

surrounded by all that medical stuff

SARAH (V0)

And it doesnt matter that I want
to become one I still dont like
waking upin a hospital bed face-
to-face with--

DR GORDON
Im Dr Gordon

briefly from a chart when he hears her stir

Sarah struggles to sit up

Sarah is surprised at how cracked and weak her voice sounds

SARAH
(hoarse)
Can I go now

A slightly-balding doctor in his mid-40s DR GORDON looks up

Slipping into the role of able person to her helpless patient Dr

Gordon pours her a glass of water

DOCTOR GORDON
No Sarah Im afraid we need you
to stay while we run a few tests
SARAH (V0)
And run a few tubes up my nose and
stick an IV in my hand

Sarah looks down and sees the needle already in her hand

SARAH
(laughing to
herself)
Too late
(beat)
Look I got dizzy and passed out
Since when does that call for tests

DOCTOR GORDON
That doesnt Its the 14 hours you
spent unconscious afterwards

SARAH (V0)
Now this is news

DOCTOR GORDON

Its a sign the bodys dealing with

something If we can identify that

something perhaps we can help your

body deal with it
Sarah lies back dejectedly

CUT TO

A MONTAGE of evil-looking tests being run

- An extremely cold-looking CAT-Scan machine swallows Sarah
like a cat devouring a tasty bird

- More blood is taken from an already pale Sarah

- Probes are placed on and in every part of Sarahs defenseless
body Even though you dont know Sarah very well yet you
gotta sympathize

cur TO

INT SARAHS HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

Sarah sits up in her bed Physically she looks better but

judging from the shocked look on her face shes just gotten some

bad news

SARAH
Leukemia

Dr Gordon speaks seriously but soothingly
DR GORDON
(nodding)
Acute myeloginous
(quickly)
Its not as bad as it sounds Sarah

‘SARAH
(sarcastic)
I didnt mean to jumpto conclusions
Please tell me the positive side of
having cancer

DR GORDON
Sarah I know it all sounds pretty
grim but we have very effective
treatment programs Many people go
into remission and continue to live
full healthy lives

Dr Gordons voice drones on but Sarah isnt listening anymore
Her eyes stray to the clothes hanging in her closet The
ridiculous leopard-skin coat leggings and boots

SARAH (VO)
I want to go home

cuT TO
INT KANKAKEE - 7-11 PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

Sarah dressed in the leopard-skin coat tights and boots is
making a call Tourists in shorts and t-shirts stare at her
curiously as they buy their Snapple and Cheetoes Its 85°

SARAH
(into phone)
Just call me at home if anything
urgent comes up

Sarah moves to hang up then glances at the hospital bracelet
still encircling her wrist She tries to pull it off but it isnt
budging

SARAH
(cont )
Carla Yeah If a Doctor Gordon
calls you dont know where I am

Sarah hangs up After a moment she picks the phone back up drops
coins in dials another number and waits as the line RINGS and
RINGS Finally a machine picks up on the other end and the BEEP
is heard Sarah hesitates uncertain then finally speaks
SARAH
(faltering)
Mom dad its Sarah
long pause)
Im coming home for a visit I should
get in around 700 tomorrow morning

INT 11 - NIGHT

Sarah stands in line waiting to check out She bitesan incision
in the bracelet and finally tears it off

SARAH (V0)
Im not going home for the reasons
you might think love comfort
parental support I’ve always been
kind of self-sufficient

Sarah walks up to the counter and puts down a l-liter Mountain
Dew The teenage CLERK stares curiously at her outlandish outfit
and the ripped hospital bracelet as he rings up her purchase

cuT TO
INT SARAHS CAR - NIGHT

Sarah is obviously exhausted as she drives down the almost-
deserted highway She drinks her Mountain Dew and has Smashing
Pumpkins cranked as loud as her speakers will allow

SARAH (VO)

You might think the fact that I
happen to be one of the 25000
adults diagnosed with leukemia
annually would support my random
theory but for once it appears
cosmic justice has caught up with
me Because as it happens I
deserve to die

(beat)
But thats just not the kind of
message you leave on your parents’
answering machine

She passes a cop that has pulled someone over Instinctively she
taps the brakes

SARAH (V0)
Why do I slow down I dont know
Its not like the cop is going to
throw down his ticket pad and come
after me (MORE)
SARAH (VO CONT)
(beat)
Even if he did I now have the
perfect excuse Im dying and Ive
got to hurry up and do some shit

Pulsing beat or no Sarahs eyelids are drooping

ON FLASHING RED LIGHT MATCH cur TO
FLASHBACK - THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE A-TEAM ON A TV SCREEN

Two little boys -- JON and RICKY -- avidly watch Mr T and the
rest of his vigilante gang wreak havoc in the name of justice For
no particular reason Jon shoves Ricky Ricky shoves back Its a

INT KITCHEN

In the kitchen a gawky 12-year-old Sarah makes popcorn at the
stove An adorable one-year-old JENNIFER watches curiously from
her walker Jon and Ricky can be heard yelling at each other

SARAH
(yelling)
Guys Truce now or the tv goes off
and the pajamas go on

The sound of the two boys fighting in the living room grows to a
deafening pitch Sarah looks at Jennifer and raises her eyebrows

SARAH
Youre much too good to be related
to those two
Jennifer smiles in response As soon as the POPS issuing from the
covered pot subside Sarah turns off the burner and sets the pot
on the counter Jennifer cant take her eyes off the popcorn
Sarah pushes Jennifers walker into the living room

INT LIVING ROOM

Sarah has to step in and physically separate the brawling
brothers

SARAH
Okay whats the problem
JON
He started it

RICKY
You hit me jerkwad

unnoticed Jennifer starts to scoot back toward the kitchen

JON
your fat head was in my way

Jon tries to get at Ricky again but Sarah holds them apart

SARAH
Id hate to have to throw all that
popcorn away

Jon and Ricky eye each other pondering a truce borne out of
mutual hunger Suddenly Sarah looks around

SARAH
Wheres Jennifer

And then she hears a strange NOISE as of something THUMPING
against something else It builds and turns into a horrible
GRATING SOUND

CUT TO
INT SARAHS CAR - DAWN

The GRATING SOUND is Sarahs car SCRAPING against the guard rail
on the right side of the road She fell asleep

Waking and panicking she overcompensates and swerves left across
two lanes and onto the grassy median where she slams on her
brakes Luckily the road is deserted

Sarahs face is streaked with tears She buries her head in her
hands

Slowly she looks up and is taken aback by the subtle beauty of a
Midwest sunrise the palest lavenders pinks and grays streaked
with wispy clouds
How could anything be wrong on a day like this

EXT STANTON ILLINOIS - RAYS SUNOCO - EARLY MORNING

The sun is a little higher in the sky when Sarah pulls into this
filling station

BUDDY CARROLL a good-looking 21-year-old walks over and eyes the
scrape along the passenger side of the car

BUDDY
You know I could take care of
that--

He walks around the car and bends down to the drivers side window
as Sarah not looking opens the door The window frame CRACKS
against his head and he falls to the ground

SARAH
Ohmigod Im sorry
(helping him up)
Are you okay

Reeling like a punch-drunk fighter he blinks his eyes as he looks
up at her The sun is behind her and he only sees an angelic
silhouette

BUDDY
Sarah
SARAH
(incredulous)
Buddy
BUDDY

Its Henry now

He points to the namepatch on his chambray workshirt to prove it
Sure enough it says “Henry”

Sarah helps him up and seems amazed when he towers over her at
over six feet tall

SARAH
Youre so big
BUDDY
‘s been six years you know I

drink milk

Buddy cant believe he said that These two speak in the shorthand
of people who have known each other all their lives but the

undercurrent is strange almost embarrassed
SARAH
Im sorry Im so used to self-
serve
BUDDY

Ill get it
ll

Buddy and Sarah surreptitiously size each other up as he pumps
gas

INT RAYS SUNOCO
Buddy leads Sarah in He rings up the gas

BUDDY
Thatll be twelve even

Sarah hands him a credit card and he shakes his head
apologetically

BUDDY
Sorry Sarah Cash only

Buddy is staring at her bizarre coat Sarah notices but doesnt
offer an explanation

SARAH
Forget where I am
(smiles)
you know youre the only gas station
on earth that doesnt take credit
cards

BUDDY
Talk to my dad Progress marched on
and left him in the dust

SARAH
Hows he doin

Sarahs catches herself with a grimace Shes been home for ten

minutes and is already picking up the native drawl she worked so
hard to get rid of

BUDDY
Good good

Sarah hands him a twenty Buddy nods toward her car as he makes
change

BUDDY
I-I was saying before I can give
you a good deal on a little body
work

Sarah smiles at his words

SARAH
Now theres an offer I dont get
every day

Buddy shakes his head embarrassed

BUDDY

SARAH
Ohhh Thanks I11 think about it

Hows Daniel doing
SARAH

BUDDY
Oh Ive seen him home on breaks

busy
Sarah is walking out Buddy speaks up before he loses his nerve
BUDDY
Hey would you maybe want to go see

SARAH
I really dont think Im gonna be

There is an awkward beat as Sarah hesitates before leaving
SARAH
(cont )
It’s good to see you

BUDDY
Yeah Same here

Then shes gone Buddy watches her get in her car and head for
town He couldnt take his eyes off her if he tried

BUDDY
(to himself)
I drink milk Idiot

INT SARAHS CAR

Sarah drives through the almost-deserted Main Street then turns
onto a residential street

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET

Two WOMEN in their 50s dressed in hideous sweatsuits are
racewalking Their breathing is labored and they seem near
collapse They stop to watch Sarahs car pass

WOMAN 1
Wonder what could bring her home

WOMAN 2
Trouble most likely

The two women try to shrug it off but their curiosity is as
tangible as their fatigue

FURTHER DOWN THE STREET

Sarah pulls into the driveway of a red-brick house She gets out
andwalks inside through a side screen door

EXT MORRISEY HOUSE

Across the street a WOMAN watches Sarah enter the house

In her mid-40s LORRAINE MORRISEY is just starting to go gray

Though her eyes are cold a vague afterimage of the attractive

woman she once was persists

She stares at the door Sarah went through for a few moments Then

she picks up her clippers and goes back to pruning her spectacular

rose bushes fixating on the roses as she clips methodically
MATCH CUT TO FLASHBACK

The same roses bathed in the shadows of

Night Flashing lights Urgent but unintelligible VOICES The
CLANG of metal against metal

A BEVY OF EMTs TRAMPLE the rosebushes as they run past pulling a
stretcher

EXT MORRISEY HOUSE NIGHT

A younger Lorraine and her husband HOWARD arrive home to find an
ambulance and police car parked in front of the house

A few NEIGHBORS mill about the front yard speculating what the
trouble might be They stop whispering and turn to stare when they
see Lorraine approaching She eyes them back terrified

LORRAINE
(to crowd)
What are you looking at

A ghostly male voice OVERLAPS her own at this question
SMASH CUT TO

INT MORRISEY HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING - PRESENT

Lorraine is washing the dirt from her hands and staring in the
mirror above the sink mesmerized Her husband Howard watches
her for a moment before repeating his question He has kind eyes
and a patient smile

HOWARD
Lorraine what are you looking at

Lorraine snaps out of it with a start She seems surprised to find
herself in the bathroom but recovers quickly

LORRAINE
(isnt it obvious)
The mirror
She walks out leaving him staring after her from the doorway
INT MORRISEY HOUSE KITCHEN

Lorraine walks into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee Howard
follows sits at the table and glances at the newspaper

LORRAINE
The Russell girl is home

Howard looks up surprised and cautious He tries a light-hearted
tone

HOWARD
Which one

Lorraine sits down across from her husband and makes it clear
shes not amused

LORRAINE
The only one

HOWARD
So Sarahs home

He looks at her over the top of his paper She avoids his eyes and
drinks her coffee

INT RUSSELL HOUSE - MORNING

Sarah hears voices talking excitedly in the kitchen as she walks
in the doorway

SARAH
Hello

The voices abruptly stop Sarah pauses a little confused then
walks into

INT RUSSELL HOUSE - KITCHEN
Corn-fed PHIL and GAYLE RUSSELL are the definitive Midwest
parents Phil wears a mailmans uniform and Gayle wearsa Century
21 blazing yellow blazer
They stand by the kitchen table Both seem strangely tense as if
theyre suppressing something The only noise is THE TODAY SHOW
squawking from the small tv on the counter
SARAH
Hi

PHIL
Hi honey

Gayle exchanges a look with Phil
GAYLE
We just talked to Carla Apparently
you got an important call this
morning

Sarah cant believe her ears This is definitely not how she
wanted them to hear about her illness

SARAH
I can explain

GAYLE
you did it sweetheart

Sarah is completely confused by these words

PHIL
Harvard Med School You made the cut

Sarah is stunned Her parents run to her and envelop her in hugs

cuT TO

INT MORRISEY HOUSE - MORNING

Jon and Rick now in high school zip around the kitchen gathering
breakfast on the go Lorraine sorts laundry from a hamper She
looks at her box of detergent

LORRAINE
Howard I need some detergent
Could you pick it up

Now dressed in a suit Howard is walking out the door

HOWARD
Im in meetings ‘til 615 Jon

Jon is walking out the back door

JON
Baseball Dad

Rick doesnt wait to be asked as he follows Jon out the back door
smoothly picking up a set of car keys as he goes

RICK
Cant Dad Yearbook meeting

LORRAINE
Richard Come back here

Rick eases back into the house guiltily

LORRAINE
Your brothers driving

Rick turns to Howard He obviously knows its useless to argue
with Lorraine

RICK
Dad Ive got my permit How am
I supposed to learn if I never
drive

HOWARD
(quiet )
Jons driving Ill take you out to
Reservoir Road this weekend for a
few practice runs

RICK
Thanks Dad

Rick doesnt even address Lorraine as he runs out the door Howard
moves to leave Lorraine puts the last of the detergent in the
washer and lets the lid “accidentally” close with a BANG

HOWARD
(turning back)
Lorraine cant you just--

She cuts him off with a look Theres tension here that Howard
doesnt have the time or energy to deal with He gives in

HOWARD
(cont sighs)
Ill try and bring some home at
lunch

LORRAINE
Thank you

Howard gives her a quick awkward kiss on his way out the door

INT RUSSELL HOUSE - DAY

The house is quiet Everyone has left to live their lives

Sarah sits in front of the tv OPRAH is on but she seems to be
staring through the screen

Slowly she stands and approaches the bay window facing the
street Carefully remaining hidden behind the curtains she stares
at the Morrisey house

CUT TO
INT LORRAINES WORKSHOP - DAY
This screened-in workshop is an extension of the house just off
the kitchen Its cluttered with antique furniture in various
stages of restoration
Motes of dust dance in the sunlight slanting in the windows as
Lorraine sands the rough spots on a small wooden cedar chest Its
smaller than a hope chest but bigger than a jewelry box
Lorraine is completely caught up in her work

cUuT TO
INT RUSSELL HOUSE - DAY

Its difficult but Sarah pulls herself away from the window
Suddenly her attention is caught by Oprahs intro

OPRAH WINFREY

(on screen)
Todays topic is “Pregnant Teens Who
Try To Hide Their Condition From Their
Parents Are they solving the problem
by dealing with it themselves or avoiding
it by refusing to seek help and advice
Well find out in just a moment

CUT TO
INT RUSSELL HOUSE - GAYLES BEDROOM - EVENING

Gayle is sitting on her bed Papers are spread around her and she
sorts through them Sarah KNOCKS softly and enters

GAYLE
Hi

SARAH
Got a minute

Gayle is a little surprised This isnt like Sarah Gayle pats an
empty spot on the bedspread

GAYLE
Have a seat

Gayle pages through a pile of property listings obviously not
able to find what shes looking for

SARAH
You were probably wondering why I
came home like I did

GAYLE
(distracted)
Hmm
(beat)
Im sorry if Carla ruined your
surprise
SARAH

It wasnt about med school

When Gayle looks up she notices Sarahs disheveled hair She
starts to smooth it

GAYLE
Who cuts your hair You probably pay
good money

Sarah ducks her head away trying to avoid her mothers hand

SARAH
No mom its okay I only use my
bad money
Gayle is too preoccupied to catch Sarahs sarcasm or maybe she
just doesnt listen
GAYLE
What do you pay 30 35
SARAH
50
(turns)

Look mom forget about my hair

Gayle tries to forget about the hair but its difficult She
finally notices that Sarahs upset about something

GAYLE
Sarah if its the money dont
worry I already checked into a
student loan

SARAH
Its not that I just dont know if
this is the right thing for me to be
tackling right now--

Gayle is surprised by Sarahs reluctance but laughs it off

GAYLE
Oh come on This is the only thing
youve wanted to tackle since you
graduated
(beat)
Youre just nervous

Phil sticks his head in the door as he passes by
PHIL
Just talked to Daniel Hell be
home tomorrow afternoon
Sarah is surprised by the news
GAYLE
All my brilliant offspring under the
same roof What more could a mother
ask for

Gayle sees that something is still bothering Sarah

GAYLE
(cont )
I know this Harvard thing is weird
You just resigned yourself to not
going and now youre going so stop

worrying
Gayle reaches out and hugs Sarah From Sarahs expression we know
this is very uncharacteristic -- she doesnt quite know how to
react

Sarah looks at her mom and herself in the mirror Gayle is so
happy Sarah just doesnt know how to tell her the truth

CUT TO
INT RUSSELL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The next day we see Sarah sitting in the same spot deep in
thought She rubs the bridge of her nose as if trying to suppress
some pain

She tries to pull herself out of it by flipping through the
channels

SARAH (VO)
Why cant I just tell my mother
Maybe I just want to hold onto my
normal life a little bit longer
Well

(a little laugh)
My reasonable facsimile of a
normal life

OPRAH is on again Sarah doesnt want to watch it but something
draws her to it

OPRAH WINFREY
(on screen)
Okay were back with “Victims
Of Repressed Guilt And Anger Who
Manifest That Guilt In An Actual
Physical Illness My next guest
feels responsible--

Sarah CLICKS the tv off

Once again she stands and looks out the bay window at the
Morrisey house

Sarah makes what is probably the hardest decision of her life
and heads for the door before she can change her mind

INT LORRAINES WORKSHOP - DAY
Lorraine is again working on the cedar chest carefully replacing
pieces of mother-of-pearl in the intricate design on the boxs
lid She is in a world of her own
An insulated world that she is in complete control of
For now
Until the doorbell RINGS
Cur TO
EXT MORRISEY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR

Sarah stands waiting She suddenly realizes shes holding her
breath and lets it out

After several moments she decides to walk around the side of the
house

CUT TO
INT LORRAINE S WORKSHOP

Lorraine has ignored the doorbell She seems satisfied when it
isnt repeated All is blissfully silent again

But then a KNOCK sounds at the screen door that leads outside
Lorraine looks up with a start like a rabbit caught in
headlights

SARAH
(through screen door)
Hi

Lorraine recognizes Sarah instantly but remains silent as if
hoping she will just go away

EXT WORKSHOP

Sarah may have psyched herself up for this but now that shes
here her resolve wants to abandon her Shes never been so
nervous but she forces herself to try conversation

SARAH
(cont )
Well I just wanted to come over
and say “hi Can I come in

Lorraine still doesnt say anything Sarah hesitates but then
enters anyway

INT WORKSHOP

Sarah looks around curiously like a tenant interested in renting
the space Lorraine looks up surprised by Sarahs audacity

“awkward” doesnt begin to describe this meeting Its obvious
these two havent spoken in years

SARAH
I came by to--

Sarah stops abruptly How is she supposed to do this Blurt out
“Can you forgive me Lorraine looks up almost as if she heard
Sarahs thoughts

Sarah avoids Lorraines intense gaze and instead fingers various
half-finished treasures until she sees the beautiful mother-of-
pearl chest She tries to use it to jump start a conversation

SARAH
Thats beautiful

LORRAINE
Is that why you came over You want
something restored

Sarah is startled by Lorraines voice She grabs onto the lifeline
Lorraine has inadvertently tossed her

SARAH
Maybe

LORRAINE
Its pretty simple Either you do
or you dont

SARAH
Well I dont have a particular
piece in mind Does everyone bring
stuff to you

Lorraine realizes that shes going to have to converse

LORRAINE
Not always I have a partner who goes
around to estate sales and picks up
things I restore them and she sells
them

Lorraine grabs a business card off a nearby rolltop desk and hands
it to Sarah

LORRAINE
(cont )
Heres her number Tell her what kind
of piece you want and shell give you
an estimate if she can

Lorraine goes back to work Conversation over Sarahs still
looking around After a moment Lorraine looks up expectantly

SARAH
(hesitant)
I was hoping you could help me find
something

Sarahs so tense she cant keep a quaver out of her voice
Struggling to be casual Sarah leans against an ancient table
Unfortunately one leg is loose and it teeters precariously

Lorraine jumps up to steady it before it falls

LORRAINE
(curt)
No I dont do that
SARAH
Are you sure Maybe you could--
LORRAINE
(interrupting)

No is really the strongest negative

I like to use with potential customers
(motions to box)

Now I really need to get back to work

SARAH
Well thanks anyway

Sarah backs out the door hesitantly

EXT MORRISEY HOUSE

Sarah leans against the house for a moment out of Lorraines
sightline before heading back to her house Its obvious shes
regretting her move

INT LORRAINES WORKSHOP

Lorraine struggles to concentrate on what shes doing After a
moment she looks out the screen door and watches Sarahs
departing back with an intense curiosity she couldnt let herself
show before

EXT RUSSELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Sarahs 21-year-old brother DANIEL pulls up in front of their
house in his battered Ford Escort The car is loaded with luggage
and bags of dirty laundry

Rather than unload his car Daniel pulls a basketball out and
starts shooting baskets on their driveway He is tall and lanky
with an outgoing exuberance

SARAH (0C)
Hey Welcome home stranger

Daniel looks up to see Sarah returning from the Morrisey house
She runs up and gives him a hug

DANIEL
Welcome home yourself Whatre you
doing over there

He gestures to the Morrisey house

SARAH
Just saying “hi

DANTEL
And did you get a reply

SARAH
(shrugging it off)
Of course Does she ever leave

DANIEL
According to mom no
(in a creepy Vincent
Price voice)

She only comes out to trim her rose
bushes

At that moment Buddy drives up in a white pick-up truck He gets
out and approaches them

BUDDY
Hey

Daniel smiles strangely at Buddy then looks pointedly at Sarah

DANIEL
Seems like old times

Sarah ignores Daniel and goes to meet Buddy

SARAH
Hows your head

Buddy lifts his hair to show the bruised bump on his forehead

SARAH
Ooooh God I am so sorry I really
whacked you

BUDDY

I thought Id take a look at your
car the estimate
The phone starts RINGING inside the house

SARAH

Sarah runs into the house Daniel and Buddy eye each other Daniel
breaks the tense silence

DANIEL
Hows it going

BUDDY
Good How was year three

Daniel throws the basketball at Buddy hard Buddy catches it with
finesse and an instant game of one-on-one springs up

DANIEL
Over Thank God Advanced thermo

Buddy dribbles past Daniel and sinks a basket

BUDDY
My heart goes out to you

Daniel smiles faintly at his tone it implies some long-forgotten
ritual of friendship

You know I dont know

Then Daniel turns to look at Buddy who stands dribbling
DANIEL
(cont )
But I dont have to guess why

Buddy throws the ball at Daniel -- hard -- as Sarah walks out the
front door

BUDDY
Im just being friendly

Buddy gives Daniel a grin which isnt returned

EXT RUSSELL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY
Around the back of the house is a separate garage where Sarahs
car is parked Buddy examines the scrape on her car closely He
makes notes on a pre-printed form on his clipboard then stands up
BUDDY

I could fix it for about
(mentally figuring)

60

SARAH
Are you kidding

BUDDY
Thats just for materials well
the paint I wouldnt charge you
for labor

SARAH

Buddy thats a great price but
its no way to run a business

BUDDY
Sarah its Henry now And you forget
where you are Customer relations are
what matter in a small community

SARAH
Customer relations
(beat)
Okay Henry Do I even need to ask
what the catch is

BUDDY
Its a request

SARAH
Lemme guess a date

BUDDY
Whatever you want to call it

Sarah pauses to think about it The last thing she needs in her
Life is a complication Buddy is obviously itching to be one

SARAH
Bud--

I dont want you to take this the
wrong way

Buddy looks down at the ground humiliated Sarah relents
SARAH

INT LORRAINE’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Lorraine is putting a coat of varnish on the mother-of-pearl box

Sarah is sitting in a beautiful old rocker paging through a photo
album filled with pictures of Lorraines work

SARAH
Howd you get started doing this

Lorraine continues to work hoping the question will fade into the
woodwork But it just hangs in the air

LORRAINE
(finally)
My grandmother taught me

SARAH
Wow All I ever learned from my
grandma was how to swear in Italian
(off Lorraines look)
Hey its been useful

Lorraine smiles faintly and notices as Sarah rubs her eyes

SARAH
(cont )
But I dont remember you doing this
before Howd you start this business

Lorraine does not appreciate anything vaguely resembling the third
degree But Sarahs direct gaze Says shes going to keep trying
no matter what

LORRAINE
Someone saw the cradle I made for
Jennifer--

Lorraine hesitates on the name but then goes on deliberately as
if reciting a recipe to a friend

LORRAINE
--and told me I should go into
business One job led to another

Lorraine trails off and gestures to the workshop around her

Desperate to change the subject Sarah points to a beautiful
painted chest in the photo album

SARAH
What about one like this

Relieved Lorraine stands up and moves to look over Sarahs
shoulder

LORRAINE
Thats Czechoslavakian From the
late 19th Century
(thinks)
Maureen might be able to find something
similar But I‘1l warn you it wont
be cheap

SARAH
But you could do it

LORRAINE
Sure

Sarah jumps up and grabs her car keys
SARAH
Come with me to Malloys and well
see what he has

Lorraine sits back down to her varnishing

LORRAINE
That man wouldnt know an antique
from a lawn ornament

SARAH
Whens the last time you were up
there
(no answer)
Come on I need your expert eye

LORRAINE
Maureen gets back next week Ill
send her up there with you then
Lorraines tone dismisses the subject Sarah stands by the door

SARAH
Why wait

LORRAINE
Because thats how I do it

SARAH
(brief hesitation)
Is it because you dont want to leave
the house

Lorraine looks up from her work slowly Her eyes are flinty Anger
smolders there

LORRAINE
Why dont you just go home Sarah

Sarah wants to argue the point but knows now isnt the time

Phil and Gayle Russell sit at opposite ends of the dining table
Sarah and Daniel eat quietly

PHIL
So Sarah how long are you
home for
Sarah looks up from her barely-touched meal

SARAH
Oh um Its just a really quiet
time for Martine--

GAYLE
(interrupting
to Phil)
What kind of a question is that to
ask your daughter She may be off on
her own but this is still her home

Gayle turns to Sarah and speaks with the barest hint of reproach
GAYLE -
(cont )
She doesnt have to answer to us

Gayle and Phil both look to Sarah as if waiting for the answer she
doesnt have to give Silence

DANIEL
(to Sarah)
You going out with Buddy tonight

Though relieved by the interruption Sarah gives him a look that
could kill Phil and Gayle are successfully distracted and highly
amused by the subject

PHIL
Buddy Carroll Youre finally
giving him a chance

GAYLE
Now Phil Buddys turned into a
nice-looking young man

PHIL
Now that he weighs more than a
hundred pounds you mean

At that moment the doorbell RINGS

PHIL
Speaking of the devil

He jumps up from his seat and goes into the living room Gayle is
close behind

Sarah stares at Daniel across the table He is drinking his milk
when he notices the dagger-shooting look Busting into laughter
he almost snorts the milk through his nose

SARAH
(acid)
Thank you Thank you very much

Sarah reluctantly rises and follows her parents into the hall

INT RUSSELL HOUSE - FRONT DOOR
Phil and Gayle open the door

Buddy is standing outside dressed in a button-down and jeans He
holds something behind his back

PHIL
Hey there Buddy

Phil motions for him to enter

GAYLE
Hows your dad

Buddy walks in and Phil closes the door

BUDDY
(a bit overwhelmed)
Thanks hes better
(beat)

Sarah appears from the dining room and quickly grabs her jacket

SARAH
(to Buddy)
Hi
BUDDY
(relieved)
Hi

Sarah smiles at her parents and raises her eyebrows

SARAH
Bye

She takes a grateful Buddy by the arm and quickly pulls him out
the door

EXT RUSSELL HOUSE - NIGHT
Buddy walks Sarah to his truck
BUDDY
Is it my imagination or is this

prom night

Sarahs clearly a little uncomfortable but shes determined to be
nice

SARAH
Im sorry Theyve gotten kind of
flaky in their old age Stepford
parents with brief flashes of
lucidity

As Buddy holds the door of his truck for her he finally remembers
to give Sarah the small bouquet of daisies from behind his back

‘BUDDY -
Its not a corsage but

Sarah takes them and breathes in their fragrance

SARAH
Buddy Carroll the romantic mechanic
Who would have guessed

Buddy is a little hurt by the hint of sarcasm Sarah cant keep out
of her voice

BUDDY
Well thats why Im giving you this
once-in-a-lifetime chance to spend
quality time with me and please
call me Henry

Buddy smiles and slams the door He runs around the front of the

truck slips and disappears from view A moment later he jumps up
and raises his arms in the touchdown signal Sarah LAUGHS

INT WILLOUGHBYS - NIGAT

This is a honky-tonk It is not a subtle place The beer flows

freely many a delicate foot is stepped on by a clunky boot and
you might get scorched stepping between some of the smoldering

glances being exchanged Not Sarahs kind of place

Buddy and Sarah are sitting at a small table near the dance floor
nursing two draft beers Buddy taps his foot as he watches the
dancing Sarah stares into her beer

BUDDY
You wanna--
(turning to Sarah)
Sarah you okay

Sarahs mind is elsewhere She snaps herself out of it

SARAH
Hmmm

Buddy catches her glancing around apprehensively

BUDDY
I was gonna ask if you
(feeling lame)
wanted to dance

SARAH
Buddy I hate to tell you but line
dancing isnt really my thing

Buddy stares at her until she drops her eyes

BUDDY
Just like high school huh It
isnt cool so youll just sit in
the bleachers

SARAH
Buddy I never did figure out the
rules in high school Are you gonna
hold it against me that I was a senior
when you were a fresh--
(stops herself)
No Im not going to have this
a conversation I already hear myself

‘ defending something that I have no

reason to be defensive about

BUDDY
Sarah Sarah hold on

Buddy takes her hand and tries to pull her to the dance floor She
resists

BUDDY
I dont wanna talk

SARAH
Fine but I dont wanna dance

Buddy obviously wants to bridge the gulf between them and he seems
convinced that this is the way Sarah will take some convincing

BUDDY
Ill let you lead

He does a few casual steps and joins the line of dancing folk

SARAH
Buddy It‘s line dancing I dont
know how to do it I dont want to
know how to do it How can I lead

Sarah softens her words with a weak smile as she looks around for
her escape but Buddys hand pulls her into the line

Shes horrible It really doesnt look like any amount of practice
is going to help

Buddys truck pulls into the driveway

Lorraines hands carefully wrap the finished mother-of-pearl chest
in protective brown paper

She glances out the screen door and sees Buddy helping Sarah out
of the truck Lorraine gets up and approaches the door for a
better view She cant seem to look away

EXT RUSSELL HOUSE

Buddy walks Sarah to the front door The porchlight is on They
stand in uncomfortable silence for a moment

SARAH
Thanks I had fun
BUDDY
(quickly)
No you didnt but thanks for
humoring me
He turns to go
SARAH

Buddy Im not trying to be

She doesnt know how to verbalize what shes feeling Buddy turns
back reluctantly

BUDDY

You know what Keep calling me Buddy
It really helps put me in my place

(beat)
Look Im sorry if I made you
uncomfortable tonight Nobody saw us
out together if that’s what youre
worried about

SARAH
Oh no

Buddy turns away but stops short He cant face her and say what
he has to say

BUDDY
Sarah remember when I followed you
around all the time

SARAH
(quietly)
Yeah
BUDDY
Well I wasnt stupid
(beat)
I was just fourteen

He walks away Sarah watches him for a beat then runs down the
steps and catches him as hes reaching for the trucks handle

sarah takes his face in her hands and kisses him deeply Buddy is
completely taken aback

Without a word Sarah runs inside and closes the front door

ON BUDDY He seems paralyzed lips still slightly parted as if
waiting for an instant replay of that kiss

Lorraine enters the room and watches Howard His face is relaxed
in sleep and he almost looks as young and hopeful as Buddy

nerve to do it if he had been awake

diapers and lotions are still stacked on the changing table Tiny
dresses are visible hanging in the closet A mobile dangles from

forehead resting on a gleaming wooden cradle The movement of her
pody as she quietly SOBS makes the cradle rock gently

the front door and through a house bustling with grim energy But
everything is strangely silent

IN THE KITCHEN

12-year-old Sarah stands at the door to the basement crying A
POLICEWOMAN is taking Jon and Ricky upstairs to put them to bed
Lorraine glarices at the boys but we sense she wasnt worried
about them

Sarah runs up to Lorraine and tries to explain what happened but
Sarahs mouth works silently All we hear is the blood RUSHING in
Lorraines ears Lorraine pushes Sarah aside and goes down the
stairs

IN THE BASEMENT

EMTs huddle around a tiny body sprawled on the unfinished
concrete floor Jennifer Dead Her walker lies on its side a few
feet away like a wrecked roadster

Lorraine ignores the sympathetic faces as she bends down to pick
Jennifer up Someones hand reaches to stop her but then
withdraws

SARAHS POV AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

Sarah watches as Lorraine carries Jennifers body up the stairs
The babys Gerber pajamas are unmarked by blood Lorraines arm
automatically supports Jennifers broken neck The baby could be
sleeping

Lorraine looks up at Sarah The sorrow in Lorraines eyes is more
devastating than any anger could ever be

WOMAN in a navy pantsuit is standing by the front door Her hands
flutter to her mouth and then back to her side as she tries to
decide what to do Howard turns to look where shes looking

with her hair flying loose and her robe whipping in the wind a
wild-looking Lorraine is POUNDING the rosebushes to a fragrant
pulp with the baseball bat

She mutters under her breath as she swings with methodical care
first left then right then left

Howard gets out of the car

GLADYS

My nieces graduation party is

she edges toward the workshops screen door as Howard edges toward
Lorraine

Her muttering voice is barely audible as she swats half-heartedly

at the broken stems Shes like a wind-up toy nearing the end of
its run

(softly)
Honey Lorraine

She looks up suddenly and sees Howard she smiles sweetly -- like
a child and holds up one finger in a just a minute gesture

LORRAINE
Almost done

HOWARD

(smiling too)
Honey Ill finish that later Lets
go inside

He slowly reaches out takes the baseball bat from her hands and
starts to lead her to the house

HOWARD

(cont

there How about some tulips

LORRAINE
Tulips Mums

(laughing)
Mums the word

Gladys steps out of the workshop holding the finished box She
peeks under the protective brown paper as she walks rather quickly
to the car

GLADYS
I left the check on the desk
(uncomfortable)
Thank you Lorraine It looks just

lovely

Now standing on the stoop arm-in-arm Howard and Lorraine almost
look like a normal Norman Rockwell couple

Lorraine looks after Gladys strangely even managing a wave

Howard nods as he tries to lead Lorraine inside There is a small
crowd of curious neighbors watching from a discreet distance

But I think she wants more

Howards hands hold Lorraines arms with a firm but gentle grip

Lorraine YANKS herself out of Howards grip with a sudden
violence His eyes betray how much her rejection hurts before he
can hide it but his voice is full of patience

Like line dancing Sarah automatically resists

Buddy expertly baits a hook and hands the rod to her then goes to
work on his own

When I said all I have is time I

What did you mean Sarah

Sarah looks at the pole trying to remember how to cast she
smiles suddenly as she accepts the challenge

rod back

cast under control

at Lorraine even more Finally Lorraine opens her car door

cur TO

EXT STANTON - MAIN STREET SIDEWALK

Lorraine and sarah walk down the sidewalk Sarah casually

windowshops Lorraine resolutely stares straight ahead as if
taking a sobriety test struggling to stay oblivious to the
curious stares of passing people

As Lorraine continues on we see

- an older WOMAN in a clothing store jumping out of her chair and
craning her head for a better look

- A young BOY walking with his mother trying to figure out
whats so unusual about Lorraine that everyone is staring at

- The two racewalking women approach from the other direction and
are so startled they almost run into Lorraine

As Lorraine and Sarah disappear into “Malloys Antiques Woman 1
bends to Woman 2s ear

WOMAN 1
What on earth Hasnt she caused that
woman enough grief

WOMAN 2
I told you trouble

INT MALLOYS - DAY

This dusty old shop is full of piles of junk which the ancient
and clueless owner IRV MALLOY will insist are all gen-u-ine
coll-ectibles

He sits up from his rickety chair as Lorraine and Sarah enter the
shop His cigarette falls from his lips into the newspaper he was
reading and starts to smolder

Lorraine takes a deep breath of air and seems comforted by the
antiques surrounding her She notices Irvs smoking paper and
smiles

LORRAINE
Irv you really think you should
be starting a fire in a shop full
of hundred year old wood

Irv throws the paper to the floor and stamps on it
IRV

(under his breath)
Well I11 be damned

Lorraine nods a greeting which Irv returns in a typically non-
verbal Midwestern fashion

Sarah pulls Lorraine over to a box similar to the one she saw in
the book Lorraine inspects it carefully before giving her
whispered approval

LORRAINE
Youve got a good eye I think its
Rumanian Great lines solid

She eyes the carved and painted design on the wooden lid The
colors have all faded but the fine craftsmanship is self-evident

Lorraine eyes Irv out of the corner of her eye

LORRAINE
Irv will never know what hes got
unless I try to buy this

Sarah thinks for a moment then smiles

SARAH
loudly)
Well I dont care what you think
Im gonna buy it anyway

Lorraine stares at Sarah for a moment before catching on and
raising her voice so Irv can hear

LORRAINE
Its your money But dont expect me
to restore it Ive gotta have some-
thing to work with

Lorraine points to the boxs supposedly shoddy workmanship
LORRAINE -
(cont )
I cant perform miracles
Sarah grabs the box protectively and walks up to Irv
SARAH
(defiantly)
Then Ill leave it just the way it
is

Lorraine and Sarah walk in the screen door Sarah cant suppress a
satisfied smile as she sets the box down gently

SARAH
Thirty bucks

Lorraine walks around the box eyeing it from all angles Her mind
is already racing

LORRAINE

Sarah takes a seat on an old rocker and rocks excitedly

SARAH
Can I watch

Lorraine stares at Sarah for a long moment

LORRAINE
Well that‘s not really how I work

SARAH
Oh please Id really like to learn
how to do it

Sarah is pushing Lorraines limits

LORRAINE
Sarah Im doing this
(beat)
Why dont we just let it go at that

Lorraine voice is gentle but firm It brooks no argument Sarah
nods slowly The exertion of the day is starting to show in her
face

SARAH
Im sorry Youre right

Sarah stands to go and almost falls over Lorraine reaches out to
steady her

LORRAINE
You okay

SARAH
(nodding)
I got too much sun yesterday And
the rocker

Sarah trails off Lorraine smiles curiously -- since when has
three minutes on a rocker ever made anyone dizzy

LORRAINE
Yeah it rocks Theyre funny that way

As sarah heads for the screen door Lorraine relents

LORRAINE
Look Sarah the doors usually

Howard LAUGHS and reaches over to place the coffee cup on a
coaster

HOWARD
You have paint on your nose

Lorraine pauses to wipe it spreading more pale green paint on her
nose and even getting a smear on her cheek

LORRAINE
Hows that

HOWARD
Good Youre starting to look like
the Wicked Witch of the West

Lorraine looks at Howard for a moment wondering if thats a
veiled comment on her attitude But his smile is innocent enough

He takes a rag and very carefully wipes the paint off her face
They are very close and we see a brief hint of the chemistry that

brought these two together
Lorraine steps back awkwardly and the spell is broken

Thank you
Howard stares at the new box as he retrieves his coffee and sips

HOWARD
Whos this one for

Howard looks at her and narrows his eyebrows
HOWARD
Do you realize thats the first time
Tve heard you call her “Sarah” in
twelve years

Well it is the girls name

I thought you didnt want to have
anything to do with her

Sarah standing there

Hi Come on in

Sarah enters looking a bit worse for wear but smiling brightly
to cover it

SARAH
I was just on my way
(stops short)
nowhere so I thought Id drop by

Sarah admires the work Lorraine has already done on the box
LORRAINE

Sarah I told you to come by any
time you wanted

SARAH
I thought maybe you were just being
polite
LORRAINE

Well I think its been a while since
anyone has interpreted my behavior
as “polite”

Sarah starts walking around the workshop as Lorraine continues
Lorraines voice implies she doesnt care what people think but
Sarah cant help but wonder

LORRAINE
(cont )
Im sure most of the terms people
use around town are decidedly not
polite

Unwilling to comment Sarah examines an old quilt hanging on a
quilt-rack The beautiful antique is composed of thousands of tiny
triangles of every sort of material none larger than a paper
clip

SARAH
Did you make this

LORRAINE
No My great-great-great grandmother

started that in 1855 Everything is
hand-stitched

CLOSE ON THE QUILT Intricate curliques decorate the seams The

amount of work put into it is staggeringly obvious Its truly a
work of art

SARAH
(disbelieving)
yeah right Wouldnt it fall
apart or something

LORRAINE
Apparently not I still use it It
went to the 1904 Worlds Fair in St
Louis and would have taken the top
prize if my idiot Aunt Moria hadnt
machine stitched the border

SARAH
You shouldnt talk about her like
that

LORRAINE
Why not Just because she was born
a hundred years ago doesn’t mean
she had the wisdom of the ages
(beat)
Everyone makes mistakes

Sarah looks up quickly at that is it directed towards her
Lorraines face betrays nothing

S
Would you ever consider selling it

LORRAINE
Impossible Its been passed down
through the women in my family for
five generations--

Lorraine stops abruptly as she realizes that she has no daughter
to pass it on to Sarah realizes at the same time

cant suppress a smile as she watches Buddys efforts The goal is
definitely to impress Sarah

Granted it isnt lunch on the Seine

Buddy tries to uncork the wine but only manages to break the cork
halfway sealing the wine in the bottle forever

Ten points for trying

He pulls two cold beers out of the hamper Sarah LAUGHS as he
hands her one

important Why was I meeting you

her closer and kisses her softly Electricity is in the air Sarah

INT LORRAINES WORKSHOP - DAY

sarah sits next to a wooden chair diligently sanding one leg

Lorraine has given her a practice piece but she may be regretting
the impulse She looks over at Sarah and sighs

LORRAINE
Sarah youre making a gallant
effort but

SARAH
But what

Sarahs enthusiasm makes it difficult to criticize

LORRAINE
Lemme see that

Sarah grins as she steps back to let Lorraine see the chair

They both realize that the leg she has been sanding is now much
skinnier than the others Sarah is humiliated but Lorraine smiles
encouragingly

LORRAINE
Youve got the right idea Just dont
think about it so much

Sarah furrows her brow not quite getting it

LORRAINE
(cont )
Sanding is like sex Its all in
the rhythms

SARAH
Gee Those are two worlds I never
thought would collide

Lorraine smiles Sarah stands up holding the small of her back

LORRAINE
youre pretty young to have a bad
back

Sarah smiles and tries to cover the very real pain

SARAH
(light)
This is what a desk job does to you

Sarah goes to the closet where Lorraine keeps supplies for a fresh
piece of sandpaper Inside she finds the cradle hidden under a
pile of old blankets and bends down to examine it

SARAH
Hey whats-- Is this the famous
cradle that started the business

Lorraine NOTICES and the mood darkens

LORRAINE
Just let that be

Lorraines voice is sharper than she intended it to be Sarah
stands unsure what she did wrong

SARAH
Im- Im sorry

Lorraine doesnt say anything but Sarah notices that her hands
are shaking Sarah looks closely at the cradle and remembers whose
it was

SARAH
(gently)
you really shouldnt let that sit
unused

LORRAINE
Why You planning on having a baby

SARAH
(wincing)
No Im not going to have any

Lorraine eyes Sarah strangely perhaps picking up on something in
her voice that everyone else has been ignoring
But her building anger is overwhelming her concern

LORRAINE
Youre awfully young to be making
a statement like that

Lorraine goes back to the detailed painting but her hands are
still shaking She messes up

LORRAINE
Godammit Look at that

Sarah grabs the paint thinner She dabs some on the end of what
looks like a long q-tip

SARAH
Here

Sarah holds the swab out to Lorraine

But Lorraines shaking has increased Sarah looks at her
guessing whats really wrong but unable to fix it

Slowly Lorraine lowers her face into her hands and SOBS

After several moments Lorraine looks up at Sarah and examines her
face looking deep into her eyes

LORRAINE
(finally)
What are you doing here Sarah

SARAH
I youre making me--

she gestures to the box -- the self-evident answer
LORRAINE
I thought I could do this

When you walked in that door last
week I thought maybe youd finally
come to apologize for what happened

Howard pulls in the driveway He gets out of the car and walks in

Howard walks in and hears Lorraines voice raised in the workshop

INT LORRAINE S WORKSHOP

Lorraine has taken the swab and dabs at the mistake struggling to
remain calm Its a losing battle

LORRAINE
But youre just making it worse

Sarahs voice struggles to stay even

SARAH
Im sorry

Lorraine angrily throws the swab to the ground

LORRAINE
(voice cracking)

Is that supposed to help Why didnt
you just-- Why werent you there Why
didnt you stop her Her neck was
proken No one that little should
hurt like that She was a baby You

We left you in charge You were
responsible

Sorry You keep saying that like it

A harsh voice of reason interrupts Lorraines hysterics

Startled Lorraine and Sarah look up to see Howard who has
entered unnoticed

But shes got to tell me why

HOWARD
No Lorraine

LORRAINE
If I just understood why--

HOWARD
(interrupting)
What It would all be okay Youd
be a whole person Wed be a normal
family again

Howard rips his coat off and throws it over a chair There is an
ember of frustration thats been smoldering in Howard for years
Now its igniting

HOWARD

(cont )
you know Lorraine for twelve years
every look you gave me said Why
didnt you fix the latch on the
basement door like you promised you
would

(beat)
Every look you gave the boys said
“why did you fight and distract

This information is a revelation to Lorraine

LORRAINE
No I never

HOWARD

Dont you think Ive been hurting
or the boys We miss her every day

There are no answers for your whys

her own sorrow aside and see another point-of-view

I hurt the boys

HOWARD

They really liked her too

left unnoticed

EXT MORRISEY HOUSE - FRONT YARD

Sarah is running across the street towards her house Howard YELLS
after her

HOWARD

garah doesnt slow and Howard runs after her

EXT RUSSELL HOUSE - FRONT YARD

Howard reaches Sarah and stops her from entering her house When
she turns he sees that the dam has finally burst and she cant
stop crying

SARAH
I didnt go back over She came
to my door And I was-- she was
so happy that she came across the
street I didnt ask her-- I never
meant -

Sarah SOBS uncontrollably Howard hugs her to him and tries to
comfort her

HOWARD
Oh God Sarah I wasnt gonna yell
at you I know its not your fault

SARAH
(muffled into
his shirt)

But it is I have proof

He holds her face so she can see how serious he is

HOWARD
None of it is your fault Okay

Howard isnt satisfied until Sarah meets his eyes and nods almost
imperceptibly

Howard suddenly realizes the intimacy of their situation there on
the front yard He draws his hands back and laughs self-

consciously

HOWARD
she actually walked across the
street

Sarahs breath hitches in her throat as she struggles to regain
her usually-impregnable composure

SARAH
(nodding)
We went downtown too

Howards face fills with amazement

HOWARD
She didnt say a word to me
SARAH
I think shes still getting her

sea legs

Howard turns to walk back to his house but gets in one last
parting shot

HOWARD
Well if thats the fault of anyone
we know tell her “thank you

Sarah looks at Buddy’ and knows then and there he loves her and

its an impossible situation

She hands him a check with a polite little smile

Buddy hesitates unsure why she seems to be giving him the brush-
off

SARAH

Im sorry do you need that in cash

BUDDY
No this is fine

Why do I suddenly want you to call
me Buddy again

Sarah shrugs Her cold shoulder is hard to miss but Buddy tries
anyway

went from being a “romantic” to being
a “mess” And you just remembered this
someone now

SARAH
Buddy you and I had a couple
beers together Thats it

BUDDY
Yeah sure I was just--

Buddy doesnt know what he was just--

Angry and frustrated he turns to leave and remembers that he
drove Sarahs car over He was obviously going to ask her for a
ride home

BUDDY

best in you

look on Sarahs face The look that says Come back

screen door She sees Sarahs look and recognizes it Its the
look shes been hiding from her own husband for twelve years as
she’s pushed him farther and farther away

As Lorraine turns from the window she just catches the tail end
of a conversation in the kitchen

JON (0C)
Nah He graduated but their new

Try to save the major ass-kicking
for the later innings

Lorraine smiles and she can almost hear Jon smiling as he replies

JON (0C)
sorry I kick ass at will G ‘night

Jons face appears in the doorway He speaks tentatively unsure
of her mood He obviously knows better than to invite her to the
game

JON
Night mom

LORRAINE
Goodnight

Lorraine sits back down to work Sarahs box is almost done After
a moment Howard appears at the door watching her work

HOWARD
(softly)
Hi Im going to bed

Howard walks over to kiss her goodnight Lorraine hesitates then
turns the chaste kiss into a real one Howard breathes in the
scent of her freshly-washed hair and is surprised to find himself
aroused Lorraine rinses her paintbrush

LORRAINE
Ill go with you

Howard is a bit stunned to say the least He gestures to the box

HOWARD
Are you done with that
LORRAINE
For now Unless you want to stand
here hold hands and watch the paint
dry

Howard stares at his wife as if he doesnt quite recognize her

Slowly and very deliberately she takes his face in her hands and
kisses him thoroughly

He tentatively touches her back trailing his fingers along her
jawline as he kisses her

They‘re like teenagers discovering the magic of sexual attraction
for the first time She leads him inside the house and down the
hall to their bedroom

INT MORRISEY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

The bed is pleasantly rumpled Howard lies back and pulls Lorraine
to him tightly She fits perfectly in the crook of his arm

He stops himself abruptly

made love

HOWARD
No I remember I think Reagan was

They laugh and kiss lingeringly

crazy but you know I still love

A high school baseball game is in full swing Jon plays third base
for the Stanton Bulldogs

EXT HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT

Lorraine gets out of her car and follows the sound of bats
CRACKING against balls and the ROAR of spectators

EXT BASEBALL DIAMOND - BLEACHERS

Several spectators do doubletakes as Lorraine sits down on the
bleachers She smiles at them before turning her attention to the
game

ANGLE ON GAME

The game is heating up Theres a runner on second as Jon steps up
to bat for Stanton

He hits a long hard fly to center The fielder cant get to it

The runner makes it home as Jon is rounding third The crowd is
going wild Lorraine is standing and clapping with the rest of
them -

The ball flies back into the infield and the shortstop snags it

Jon is trapped between third and home He turns and seems to have
every intention of returning to third The COACH there claps his

encouragement

But then Jon fakes out the shortstop turning tail as soon as he
throws to third Jon pulls out all the stops and SLIDES into
home as the ball sails to the catcher Its close But the ump
rules SAFE The Stanton team members ROAR their approval along
with the home crowd

But Jon isnt basking in the adulation of his team From the dirt
at home base he spots Lorraine He stands up slowly his amazed
eyes locked with hers

Lorraine continues to CLAP Jon slowly smiles as he dusts off his
knees and gives her a tiny wave of acknowledgement She nods her
head

ANGLE ON LORRAINE

Lorraine slowly sits down energized by the game being outside
pleasing her son and just plain living again

VOICE
Hey lady Could you make room

Lorraine looks up to see Howard smiling down at her Rick is with
him

LORRAINE
sorry No room But maybe

Lorraine pats her lap invitingly Howard LAUGHS as he and Rick
squeeze onto the bleacher seat next to her

LORRAINE
Im afraid theres some bad news

Howards smile fades What now

HOWARD

Lorraine kisses Howard lightly He takes her hand

congratulate Jon They look back at Lorraine expectantly

Sarah SLAMS the book closed and covers it with her backpack as she
turns to see Lorraine standing behind her

SARAH
Hello

There is a new tension here Lorraine assumes its from their last
encounter She pulls one of the books out from under the bag

LORRAINE
Whatre you reading
(reading)
Coping With Cancer

SARAH
Research One of the essay questions
for my Harvard follow-up You know
whats my chosen area of expertise--
o-oo

Lorraine nods her head as Sarah stops abruptly nervously
realizing shes giving more information than she needs to

SARAH
(cont )
What are you doing here

Sarah is desperate to deflect attention anywhere else than on her

LORRAINE
Well its research for your box

Sarah starts piling her books together and glances at the door
Lorraine misinterprets Sarahs nervousness 4s hostility

LORRAINE
“(cont cool)
Im sorry I wasnt aware this was
your personal library

Lorraine catches herself and curbs her hostile response

LORRAINE
(cont )
Sarah the last thing I want to do
is fight with you

sarah fidgets increasingly uncomfortable She quickly gathers up
all of the books and stuffs them in her backpack

SARAH
I think you were right all along
This isnt a good idea
(beat)
I never wanted to make you feel bad
Ill just send Daniel over to get
the box when its done

Sarah voice trails off She zips her backpack closed and leaves
pefore Lorraine can even reply Lorraine stares after her
completely confused

INT WILLOUGHBYS - EVENING

Its still too early for this place to be crowded Buddy stands up
and motions Daniel over to his table

BUDDY
Hey thanks for coming

Daniel sits down across from Buddy They eye each other awkwardly

DANIEL
So whats up

BUDDY
gust thought we could catch up

Buddy motions to the WAITRESS

‘BUDDY -
can we get a pitcher of Bud

WAITRESS
can I see some ID

Buddy and Daniel pull drivers licenses out of their wallets

The waitress looks at the IDs As she walks away Daniel sees
Buddys old fake license in his wallet and LAUGHS

DANIEL
Ah ye olde fake license Why havent
you thrown this away or passed it on
to some deserving high schooler

BUDDY
(taking license)
Its a priceless symbol of my
adolescence

DANIEL
tts so bad I still cant figure out
how it worked so well all those years

BUDDY
How many times do I have to tell you
Using Morton as my first name always
got me sympathy and sympathy made me
less suspicious

Daniel nods wisely
DANIEL
As if the name Buddy doesnt get
you enough sympathy

BUDDY
Oooh Touché

DISSOLVE TO

A few pitchers later Its apparent these guys have gotten drunk
together many times over the years They pour ‘em and throw ‘em
back with practiced ease

BUDDY
go you seein anybody

DANIEL
I dated this one girl Heidi last
semester but then she joined a
sorority and went psycho on me
Buddy nods as if he knows what that means

DANIEL
What about you

BUDDY
(casual)
Nobody steady
Daniel stares at Buddy unflinchingly

BUDDY
okay fine Nobody at all

paniel bursts out LAUGHING Buddy joins hin

BUDDY
so thats pretty exciting about
Sarah

DANIEL

Buddy you find Sarahs right instep
exciting Youre gonna have to be
more specific

(realizes)
Oh you mean Harvard

BUDDY
No I meant her being engaged

Daniel spits out the swallow of beer he just downed and COUGHS

DANIEL
What are you talking about

BUDDY
You didnt know

Daniel is processing Sarahs strange behavior from the last couple
of days and her evasive answers to his questions Its all making
sense now Or at least it seems to

DANIEL
Of course I knew I just didn‘t
know you knew too (MORE)

DANIEL (CONT )
(defensive)
So what else do you want to know
about Sarah If you print up a
questionnaire I could take it home
and ask her to fill it out

Buddy stands up and almost falls over

“BUDDY
tr dont know what the hell your
problem is Youre the one who
stopped talking to me

Daniel attempts to stand up but weaves in mid-air and sits back
down heavily

DANIEL
r did not

seeing that paniel isnt rising to the challenge Buddy drops back
down to his own seat

BUDDY
you just love that you have Sarah
as an excuse to turn it around

DANIEL

Oh if Ive got Sarah youve got
your dad Youre the one who backed
out of school the day before we
were supposed to leave

(to himself)
Left me in a fucking empty dorm
room It was embarrassing

BUDDY
I told you I couldnt leave my dad
just then The man had a heart
attack

DANIEL
your dads fine You were just too
scared to leave

BUDDY
I was not He just asked me to wait

They stare at each other defiantly for a minute then realization
dawns on Daniels face

DANIEL
You mean you-

Buddy throws an envelope with the “university of Illinois logo on

the table

BUDDY
gust got word today
(beat)
My junior college credits are good
tm officially a sophomore in the
Fall

Daniel takes a minute to process this

DANIEL
So I guess youre gonna need
an experienced upperclassman to
show you around

BUDDY
well Id prefer you but -

Buddy raises his glass as if to toast

BUDDY
(tentatively)
Friends

Daniel hesitates but smiles reluctantly as he raises his glass
and CLINKS it with Buddys

DANIEL

(yes)
Never

Buddy smiles in response

INT GROCERY STORE - DAY

Daniel and Sarah are filling their cart with party platters cases
of soda bags of chips and assorted barbeque sundries

SARAH
Tell me again why were having a
Memorial Day barbeque

DANIEL
Beats me Mom invited all her clients
and I think dad just likes an excuse
to drink before five

SARAH
(sarcastic)

Well now Im giddy with anticipation

ce
DANIEL

(slyly)
So I hear youre engaged

Sarah is completely confused until she makes the mental
connections

SARAH
Ahh you and Buddy are friends
again

DANIEL

When were we not
She rolls her eyes at this

SARAH
Im glad

Sarah pushes the cart to the vegetable section and eyes the carrot

and celery selection

DANIEL
Your intense crudite scrutiny will
not deter me from the still-unanswered
question

SARAH
Glad to hear your rhetoric class
has paid off

Daniel gives Sarah some intense scrutiny of his own

DANIEL
(suspicions confirmed)
Youre not getting married Youre
just blowing my best friend off

SARAH
Im living my life Daniel If Buddy
isnt a part of it well are
you really that surprised

DANIEL
No If you actually let someone be a
part of it then Id be surprised

The truth of that comment stings Sarah

on INT DANIELS FORD - MOVING SHOT
The groceries are bagged in the back as they drive home
Sarah eyes the worn-out upholstery The engine noise is deafening
SARAH
I hate to say it but this car is
not gonna get you through four
years
DANIEL
Well thats the difference between
us Im an optimist
SARAH
Im an opti-- I can see the good
in things
Daniel is skeptical but he tries to nod encouragingly

DANIEL
Good Hold that thought

Daniel pulls into the driveway of their house and Sarah instantly
me understands what hes talking about

CUT TO
EXT RUSSELL HOUSE - DAY
A huge banner is draped across the front of the house
“CONGRATULATIONS SARAH -- OUR LOSS IS HARVARDS GAIN
People fill the front lawn drinking from paper cups and chatting
No one pays any attention as Daniel and Sarah start to get out of
the car but then Phil and Gayle walk out the door and notice

them

PHIL
Oh shit Hey everybody 1-2-3

The milling people notice Sarah and try to recover the element of

EVERYONE
Surprise

Sarah glares at obvious-accomplice Daniel and tries to smile
brightly

SARAH
Wow this is great

No it isnt
EXT RUSSELL HOUSE - DAY

As Daniel unloads the groceries Phil and Gayle lead sarah around
to say hi to everyone Sarah is doing a slow boil but hides it

SARAH

(aside to Gayle)
Mom we really should have talked
about this

GAYLE
Well that would have ruined the
surprise honey

PHIL
Come on Sarah Even you have to
appreciate the comedic irony of
grocery shopping for your own
surprise party

True enough The buffet tables are now covered with the party
platters and supplies that Daniel and Sarah bought

Gayle pulls Sarah aside to speak confidentially

GAYLE
Did you and Buddy have a fight I
had to practically drag him to the
party

SARAH
Mom you didnt

BUDDY (0C)
Hi Sarah

Sarah turns to face Buddy He hesitantly hands her a small gift-
wrapped package

SARAH
Hi
(taking package)
- you didnt have to--

BUDDY
Your mother was nice enough to
invite me

Read Im sorry This isnt my fault I couldnt get out of it

BUDDY
(cont
but Ive really got to get back
to the station

GAYLE
Oh Buddy you cant be serious You
just got here

’ BUDDY
No really A lot of boaters are
heading up to the lake for the
weekend
(beat to Sarah)
I gotta sell ‘em gas

Buddy obviously thinks his gas jockey status contributed to her
rejection of him

PHIL
Daniel tells me youre joining him
up at U of I in the Fall

BUDDY
Yeah I thought I might
Sarah is surprised by this and that Buddy didnt tell her
SARAH
Buddy thats great
BUDDY
Yeah well great

(awkward beat)
Goodbye Sarah

He makes a hasty retreat

DISSOLVE TO
Its later in the day Sarah is playing a game of jarts with
Daniel Susan and her husband JEFF She stops when she sees
Lorraine crossing the street with a determined stride

SARAH
Ill be back

Sarah runs to intercept Lorraine who looks like shes been up all
night Her gaze bores into Sarahs

LORRAINE
Youre sick arent you

Sarah looks around quickly to make sure no one can hear them

LORRAINE
(cont softer)
What is it Hodgkins

SARAH
(glibly)
Maybe Im just pregnant
‘LORRAINE
No youre not gonna have any kids
remember
SARAH

Im fine Just leave me alone

LORRAINE
Headaches backaches dizziness
Probably worse symptoms youre not
gonna tell me about

Sarah stays silent

LORRAINE
(realizing)
You havent told anyone have you

Sarah stares at the grass at her feet

SARAH
Its leukemia

Sarah seems relieved that someone else finally knows Lorraine
nods simultaneously satisfied and horrified that her suspicions
are confirmed

LORRAINE
Why on earth would you want to go
through something like this alone

Lorraines confusion turns into yet another realization

LORRAINE
(cont )
Sarah you cant think that you
deserve this

The compassion in Lorraines voice is too much Sarahs eyes are
welling up with tears But she cant let herself break down in
front of everyone

SARAH
(willing her to stop)
Lorraine I cant do this now

But Lorraine cant let it go

LORRAINE
(bare whisper)
you do think you deserve it dont
you

Sarahs eyes meet Lorraines Thats exactly what she thinks
The tension is broken when Phil TAPS a glass loudly

PHIL
Hey Can I have your attention for
a minute

The crowd quiets down AS Daniel walks over and pulls her towards
Phil Sarahs eyes swear Lorraine to secrecy

Phil drapes his arm around Sarah proudly

PHIL
First of all thanks to everyone for
coming by and helping us celebrate

Gayle steps out of the house with a plate of burgers for the
grill She quickly puts it down and joins Phil and Sarah

PHIL

(cont )
Since Sarahs mother and I believe
that nothing but the best will do
were sending her to Harvard There
will be sacrifices well be moving
into our son Daniels dorm and selling
our house so if anyone wants to make 4
bid today just talk to Gayle

The crowd LAUGHS on cue

PHIL
(cont )
okay we cant hide the fact that
were incredibly proud of our daughter
Shes not only the first Russell to
go to Harvard I believe shes also
the first Stanton resident to go

The crowd CHEERS loyally
PHIL

(cont )
so to Sarah

He and Gayle raise their glasses

GAYLE
Were sending Harvard our first and
our best
DANIEL

Hey

Everyone LAUGHS and drinks Sarah gives a weak smile
INT RUSSELL HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

door

INT KITCHEN

Gayle is hanging up the phone with a devastated expression on her
face as Lorraine walks in from the back door

LORRAINE
Gayle Phil wanted me to tell you
he needs more ice--

She stops when she sees the look on Gayles face

paniel and Sarah are still LAUGHING at the punchline to his joke
when they enter the kitchen from the other direction Gayle looks
at them with tears in her eyes

DANIEL
Mom what is it

Gayle is staring at Sarah who is conspicuously silent

GAYLE
Why dont you ask your sister

Daniel looks from Gayle to Sarah clueless Sarah glares at
Lorraine in disbelief

SARAH
(to Lorraine)
What gives you the right--

GAYLE
(interrupting)
Carla just called You got another
important phone call from a Dr
Gordon

The dam of Gayles grief and anger bursts

GAYLE
(loud)
What the hell kind of game are you
playing Sarah I mean what were you

gonna do just die in your room
Let me find out later that you were
sick

‘DANIEL

Mom she was just--
Gayle turns on Daniel angrily

GAYLE
Shes got leukemia Daniel and
I guess she just didnt feel like
telling us

Daniel turns to stare at Sarah hoping she will deny it

DANIEL
Sarah

Sarah wishes she could just disappear into the linoleum Finally

SARAH
(evenly)
It sounds like you got the full
report mom Id appreciate it if
you didnt announce it to the party
guests

Gayle stares at Sarah in shock amazed by her emotionless tone
Then more tumblers click into place as she looks at Lorraine and
realizes that she knew

GAYLE
(incredulous)
You couldnt tell your own mother
but you told her

LORRAINE
(softly)
I figured it out

Though it isnt there Gayle hears another accusation -- why
didn’t she pick up on the signs and figure it out

GAYLE
(to Sarah)
Are you trying to hurt me

Gayles tears start up again as she crosses the floor and hugs her
daughter tightly
GAYLE
(muffled)

Dont dont

Were not sure what Gayle is telling Sarah not to do Dont hurt
her Dont die Sarah pats her mothers back and locks eyes with
Lorraine This is why she didnt want to tell anyone

or his baseball cards He was generous
to a fault

But the way he said your name I
knew if he had ya hed never let you
go And the way hed treat ya youd

A wave of emotion washes over Buddys face Corny as the
expression of it may be every word his father says is true

Maybe I was readin a bit much into
the ramblins of an eleven year old

Sarah is speechless Ray suddenly realizes how much hes said

Tell him Im going away and Im--

RAY
Son I dont know what she told ya

packed open suitcase sitting on the floor Sarah begins rapidly
folding clothes and placing them in the suitcase

A KNOCK is heard at her door Sarah looks up a glimmer of hope in
her eyes

GAYLE (VO)
Sarah you okay

SARAHB
Im fine mom

Sarah starts throwing toiletries from her dresser into a smaller
duffel bag She pauses when she notices a small wrapped PACKAGE

Sarah realizes its the gift Buddy gave her at the party
Slowly she sinks to the bed and undoes the wrapping

A small velvet jewel box reveals its treasure a ring of solid
burnished pewter finely wrought with a simple scrollwork design

Sarah covers her mouth with her hand amazed by the beautiful
gift She notices a card’and opens it

The card reads Dear Sarah Congratulations Dont worry its
just a friendship ring This wasnt meant to be a last minute
‘Going Away To Med School gift and it wont be the kind of
wedding gift I wanted it to be Did I just write that Now I
definitely have to rip this card up Yours Buddy”

But he didnt rip the card up

BUDDY (0C)
It was my mothers

Startled Sarah looks up and sees Buddy standing in the doorway

SARAH
Your mothers friendship ring

BUDDY
(reluctant admission)
Her wedding ring Its passed down
through the women in my family but
» I dont have a sister

Buddy walks in and sits down on the bed next to Sarah

SARAH
So she trusted your judgment About
the woman to give it to

BUDDY
(nods)
Even then I was wise beyond my years

Encouraged by Sarahs words Buddy throws caution to the wind He
takes the ring out of the velvet box and moves to put it on
Sarahs finger

SARAH
Buddy I have to tell you something

BUDDY
(a questionplea)
Youre not getting married to this
guy from Chicago

Buddy trails off hoping against hope she‘s not going to destroy
him with a word

SARAH
No

Buddy smiles his relief and slips the ring on Sarahs finger His
gaze is direct and his voice is sure as he proposes

BUDDY
Then marry me

Sarah is shocked After a moment she realizes she wants to say

“yes but cant Still she needs him

Sarah has been repressing so many
feelings for so long she doesnt
know what she should be feeling now
Thats why she didnt want to tell
you about her illness She knew
youd respond with an outpouring of
emotion and she knew she wouldnt
be able to handle it

His VOICEOVER continues over the following
curT TO

INT ST MARYS HOSPITAL - SARAHS ROOM

Sarahs room is dark Shes asleep but tosses restlessly under
the thin hospital sheet

Gayle is slumped in a bedside chair more asleep than awake

DR VITALE (V0O)
Before the accident you said she
was a bright outgoing young girl
Afterwards she took refuge in her
guilt She was a loner in high school
Introverted in the extreme

Lorraine appears in the doorway of the dark room backlit by the
bright hallway fluorescents She gazes at Sarah‘s restless form
for a few minutes

DR VITALE (V0)
(cont )
Sarah has been turned off from her
emotions like a child whose brain is
disconnected from his nerve endings (MORE)
DR VITALE (V0 CONT)
Just like that child cant feel a
physical touch of any sort Sarah”
hasnt been able to feel an emotional
touch from anyone around her

Lorraine steps further into the room and we see that she is
carrying her heirloom quilt - the beautifully-stitched patchwork
one She gently drapes it over Sarah
DR VITALE (V0O)
(cont )

Her detachment isnt a personal attack

on you she just couldnt feel anyone

trying to get through until now
Lorraine places her cool hand on Sarahs forehead

Gayle wakes with a start as if the hand was pressed against her
own brow She sees Lorraine and the two lock eyes

Mother to mother
Seeing that Sarah is okay Gayle closes her eyes again

Sarahs restless movements slow and eventually stop but she
doesnt wake Lorraine watches a moment longer then leaves

INT BUDDYS TRUCK

Buddy drives as Sarah sits in the passenger seat wrapped in
Lorraines quilt

BUDDY
(gently)
You okay
Sarah doesnt reply
BUDDY

Come on Sarah The doctor said full
remission Thats great right

SARAH
(distant )
I guess I dont know Buddy Im
not a doctor
(bitter laugh)
And I suppose I never will be

She sounds like she couldnt care less Buddy sounds like he
couldnt care more It’s a frustrating combination
Buddy suddenly pulls to the side of the road and shuts off the
engine Sarah simply stares out the front windshield

BUDDY
Sarah Ive been trying to have the
patience of a saint for six weeks
I mean--
(frustrated)
You let me propose and you couldnt
even tell me you were sick

As he speaks Sarah gets a steely look in her eyes and removes the
pewter ring from her finger She‘s lost some weight and it slips
off too easily and falls onto the seat between them

BUDDY
(cont )
You know Id do anything Why didnt
you just tell--

SARAH
(angry)
Thats why I know youd do anything
I know it I also know Ive never
done anything to deserve that
kind of

Sarah cant finish the sentence Buddy retrieves the ring

BUDDY

Love Sarah Thats the word youre
looking for Its a funny thing It
doesnt matter if you dont feel you
deserve it People are gonna love
you and want to help you through this

(beat)
I want to

Sarah looks up at him Shes got a lot of questions but doesnt
seem to know how to put any of them into words Finally

SARAH
Buddy why would you ask me to marry
you Even if I wasnt sick As far as
you knew I was going to Harvard
Youre gonna be a goddamn undergrad
in the Fall

BUDDY
Those are just details

SARAH
Did I ever treat you well or give you
any indication You and Daniel used

to drive me insane You said it yourself
I lied to you About my illness about
my engagement Why would you--
Once again she stops herself before she can say “love me

Buddy wont let Sarah change the subject with the force of her
anger He makes her look him in the eye

BUDDY
Do you love me Sarah

Sarah looks away unable to hold his gaze
SARAH
It wouldnt matter if I did It
doesnt change anything
BUDDY
Forget changing things I could
die of an aneurysm tomorrow you
could live for another forty years
(beat)
Do you love me
After what seems like forever Sarah finds the voice to answer

SARAH
Yes

INT RUSSELL HOUSE - SARAHS ROOM

Phil sets Sarahs suitcase down and kisses her on the cheek as he
exits She smiles at him then sits on her bed

She pulls the quilt from around her shoulders and rubs it against
her cheek

cur TO
INT RUSSELL HOUSE - THE KITCHEN

Gayle watches anxiously as Sarah leaves the house clutching the
quilt

The yearning in her eyes is heart-wrenching Does her daughter
care more about the woman across the street than her own mother

INT MORRISEY HOUSE - DAY

The doorbell is RINGING A hand reaches into frame and opens the
door Sarah stands outside holding the heirloom quilt

ON SARAH

She is surprised to see Jon Morrisey They stare at each other for
a moment Hes grown about three feet since she saw him last

SARAH
Jon Or is it Rick

JON
(smiles)
Jon Hi

He motions for her to come in

SARAH
Thanks Is your mom here

JON
Yeah shes in her workshop

He motions for her to enter As she walks by him he stops her
with a tentative touch

JON
Are you okay

SARAH
(smiles)
I‘m great How are you doing

JON
(answering smile)
Better

Jon isnt sure if he needs to elaborate but Sarahs smile says
she knows exactly what he means

INT LORRAINES WORKSHOP

Sarah enters the workshop from the kitchen Lorraine is levelling
an old table with determined strokes Its pretty noisy

LORRAINE
(re table)
Hell of a warp but I think I can
save it

SARAH
Well its all in the rhythm
you know
Lorraine looks up and smiles
LORRAINE

Oh good you brought the quilt
(looks at watch)
Lets go

SARAE
Go where

CUT TO
EXT GRASSY FIELD NIGHT

A carnival is going full swing in the background but here there
are families sitting on blankets and pulling sodas out of coolers
Kids and dogs run around with equal abandon

Lorraine and Sarah are sitting on the quilt watching
FIREWORKS LIGHT UP THE NIGHT SKY

The “OOHs and AAHs of the crowd fill the quiet intervals
between bursts

SARAH
(laughing)
I cant believe I forgot it was the
Fourth of July I guess I just lost
track of time in the hospital

LORRAINE
Hows that going

SARAH
Well they say Im in remission

LORRAINE
Why do you say that like its a
dirty word

SARAH
Ive done my research You may go
into remission but you dont recover
from leukemia

LORRAINE
Well what do the people who already
went to medical school say You know (MORE)

LORRAINE (CONT )
oh what are they called the
doctors

Sarah smiles at Lorraines attempt at levity

SARAE
I rest up for a few weeks and then
we try a bone marrow transplant
I just wanted to say “thanks and
bring this back
(indicates quilt)
I found it on me one morning

LORRAINE
Keep it You can be my “honorary”
daughter

Sarah looks at Lorraine closely Though her tone is light the
words are sincere

CUT TO
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

Sarah has the folded quilt under her arm She and Lorraine walk
down their street

LORRAINE
Did you take my advice

Sarah is momentarily puzzled

LORRAINE
(softly)
About letting yourself off the hook
SARAH
I want to but its kind of tough

to let go of something thats been
keeping you going for so long

LORRAINE
Guilt isnt a lifeline Sarah I used
it to tie my family in knots and I
came awfully close to losing them
without even noticing

SARAH
Well except for Daniel I‘ve never
really been that close to my family

anyway

LORRAINE
Are you sure about that
(beat)
I think you and I are a lot alike
After Jennifer died we both shut
down I just got older but you--

Lorraine stops herself as the full impact of what Sarah must have

gone through begins to come clear
LORRAINE
(cont )

You were still growing up and
learning how to live

SARAH
(bitterly)
Or not learning

LORRAINE
I just mean you seemed to be enjoying
life before it happened Maybe
you need to remember how

SARAH
(defensively)
I am
LORRAINE
Im glad —
(beat)

Hes really cute you know
SARAH
On that note -- which I refuse to let
become a full-fledged conversation --
Im out of here
Sarah and Lorraine separate each walking to her own house

SARAH
Hey

Lorraine jumps slightly startled as she turns back

SARAH
Thanks You know for the quilt

Lorraines look says Youre welcome For everything

GAYLE (0C)
I remember when you went up to
that podium

Sarah is startled as she looks up and sees her mom standing over
her shoulder Gayle sits down next to Sarah

GAYLE
(cont )
You were so nervous Terrified We
didn‘t know if you were actually
going to be able to get any words
out

SARAH
I remember

GAYLE
But then you pulled it off with
such finesse You could always fool

us Sarah

(beat)
How was I supposed to know you were
hurting

Sarah is uncomfortable she and her mother do not discuss things
like this

SARAH
(coldly)
Is this line of questioning the
result of your meeting with Dr
Vitale

GAYLE
Dont be angry
(rethinks)
Or be angry if you want but just
dont hold it in

SARAH
Mom theres no reason for me to
be angry or for you to feel guilty

GAYLE
Sarah your father and I were wrong
to ignore what happened

Sarah stands anxious to end this conversation

SARAH
You werent You were just taking
your cue from me

GAYLE
And then I probably latched onto the
Harvard idea so strongly because it
was an easy fix - something I could
get excited about without having to
look too closely

SARAH
Please Dont try to analyze me or
us or this whole damn thing

GAYLE
Honey dont shut me out--

Sarah interrupts her softly but firmly she cant take much more
SARAH
(softly)
Can you just go now

Gayle stands up desperate to say the right thing but she doesnt
know what that is She goes

CUT TO
INT RUSSELL KITCHEN EVENING

Gayle is standing at the sink peeling potatoes staring out the
kitchen window into the back yard Tears glisten in her eyes

Silently Sarah enters the kitchen opens the refrigerator and
gets a Coke She heads back to her room but pauses in the
doorway

Sarah sets the Coke on the counter and wraps her arms around her
mothers waist resting her head on her back Gayle stops peeling
the potatoes and turns to hug her daughter
