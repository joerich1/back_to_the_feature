SIXTH DRAFT
INTERROGATION ROOM INT DAY

Dingy and smoke-filled Too hot Sweat beads up on the face of a
seated STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL He wipes his forehead and lets the
drops fall on an open dossier

He shakes his head over the dossier

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL
Unbelievable the mess you made

A stocky CIA OPERATIVE with a military haircut studies the file

CIA OP
Marital problems You say your
judgment was fucked because of
marital problems

The STATE DEPT OFFICIAL offers a cigarette pack across the wood table
to the man he interrogates

HARRISON CALLOWAY JR Mid-40s Boyishly handsome even as
disheveled and disoriented as he is now

HARRISON shakes his head

HARRISON
I dont smoke

CAPTAIN TORRES enters Clad in the dress uniform of Police Chief
blackened by smoke arm in a sling
He leans against the wall

CIA OP
Somebodys got a lot of clean-up
to do

All stare at the increasingly agitated HARRISON who reaches across the
table for the pack of cigarettes
Hands shaking he lights one up

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL
Start at the beginning How did
it happen

HARRISON looks an appeal to TORRES
HARRISON

You remember It was the day the
governor came to town
PUERTO MATANZAS EXT DAY

An ugly port town at the edge of a jungle

A trading town -- jumbled mismatched charmless but crawling with
energy At the harbor a STREET MARKET vibrates with people

ON A DOCK IN THE HARBOR EXT DAY

Even more activity than usual It is obvious by the CRUSH OF PEOPLE
by the MILITARY BAND tuning up in a bandshell by the banner that
reads BIENVENIDOS SENOR GOBERNADOR that someone important is
awaited

TORRES looks over this scene as he waits for the GOVERNOR

Behind him his men frisk onlookers as they move onto the dock and into
the bandstands

A SMALL SCUFFLE breaks out The POLICE have found a KNIFE hidden in a
SCRUFFY YOUNG MANs boot

They hustle him off the dock

TORRES nods to himself satisfied with the security measures

All is under control

He signals to another OFFICER who mans a WALKIE-TALKIE communicating
with the GOVERNORS LAUNCH out on the bay Its safe for the GOVERNOR

to land

The LAUNCH ceases circling the bay and heads for shore
The MILITARY BAND strikes up its welcoming song

BEHIND TORRES - A WHITE SHIP ON THE WATER

Makes its way into dock from the opposite direction

THE WHITE SHIP EXT DAY

An anxious but cheerful MAN studies a map and a handful of guidebooks
juggling them dropping them banging himself with the old PAN AM BAG
slung over his shoulder as he bends to pick them up A tourist a
gladhander a clumsy but nice guy VICTOR MORALES

Beside him a dark-haired clear-faced woman moves serenely into frame
preparing to disembark Imperturbable extraordinarily beautiful

ILSA MORALES VICTORs wife

With effortless efficiency she bends scoops up the fallen guidebooks
and disentangles VICTOR from his flight bag

She heads out of frame VICTOR happily follows
THE DOCK - A FEW MOMENTS LATER EXT DAY

TORRES moves forward to greet the GOVERNORS LAUNCH as it heads towards
the dock

BEHIND HIM

The PASSENGERS from the WHITE SHIP disembark

VICTORs attention is caught by the fuss on the other side

he pulls ILSAs arm and points ILSA smiles and moves on already
attracted by the sights of the town

VICTOR watches the GOVERNORS ARRIVAL with friendly interest until
a POLICEMAN asks him to move on

He gives a start and a smile apologises and hurries to catch up to
ILSA

AT ILSA AND VICTOR

He links his arm through hers affectionately and they turn a corner
toward the street market

THE STREET MARKET EXT DAY

ILSA looks at the stalls VICTOR continues to gaze with open interest
at everything that passes by

ILSA stops to finger some goods

The muted SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION a block or two away can be heard
VICTOR peers down an alley toward the street closest to the harbor
DOWN THE ALLEY

Billows of SMOKE can be seen A CROWD races down the street chased
by POLICEMEN who arrest everyone in sight

AT VICTOR AND ILSA

VICTOR turns to call ILSAs attention to this but as usual shes
moved ahead of him and inspects the wares of a FRUIT VENDOR

VICTOR hurries again to catch up and charmingly grabs up three
mangoes juggling them in the air to ILSAs obvious amusement

He tosses them back into the bin One two as hes about to lob
the third he hears the CLICK OF GUNS

He is surrounded by THREE POLICEMEN led by the same POLICEMAN who told
him on the dock to move along

Their GUNS ARE DRAWN

ILSA cries out as the POLICE march VICTOR away
THE US CONSULATE OF PUERTO MATANZAS EXT DAY

A second floor office in a dreary building ILSA stands in the first
floor doorway ringing the bell

No response

The LABEL over the doorbell says HARRISON CALLOWAY JR UNITED
STATES CONSULATE A notice lists hours the office phone number and
an EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER

ILSA pulls out a mobile phone and dials the number Worried and
distracted she looks around her Angle on --

AT THE OTHER END OF THE BLOCK - A BAR EXT DAY

A CAR is parked in front THREE BODYGUARDS wait inside

TWO MEN emerge from the bar HARRISON less harried-looking than weve
just seen him but still distracted And BUZZ PHELPS a stocky
connected American-businessman-abroad who downs the last of a beer

BUZZ

OF LOVEMAKING coming from Victor and Ilsas room

VICTOR
I killed a man in Oakland once Ran
over him with his own car A convertible
At night I had the top down Ran him
over sat and looked at the stars It
was a really special moment And I
thought -- those stars Theyre so far
away they could be dead a hundred
thousand years and Id still see em
Im looking at these lovely stars --
(takes final aim at HARRISON)
-- and theyre NOT EVEN THERE

BANG

VICTOR falls back shot tumbling over into a heap at the bottom
of the stairs

ILSA has shot him She lowers the gun staring at VICTOR

HARRISON jumps down the stairs kicks the gun from VICTORs hand
bends over him
VICTOR
(gasps)
Shes gone to the railway station
Shes gone to kill the governor

HARRISON whips around ILSA is gone HARRISON turns back to VICTOR
And with a strange smile of contentment VICTOR dies

TORRES and JAMESON burst in

JAMESON

TORRES

All look around The safe is open ILSA and the money are gone

HARRISON
The airport Shes gone to the airport

JAMESON rushes out TORRES shouts after follows him

TORRES

HARRISON stands dazed trying to make sense of things

handful of passports each made out in a different name each with a
different picture of ILSA

We see HARRISON get into BUZZS CAR and drive off

ON THE BED - THE PASSPORTS

All open to PICTURES OF ILSA
PUERTO MATANZAS RAILWAY STATION EXT DAY

ILSA walks serenely through a crowd She carries nothing but her
shoulder bag

AN ARMY BAND tunes up on a platform
A banner above the platform says ADIOS SENOR GOBERNADOR

ILSA walks past continues into the railway station

PUERTO MATANZAS RAILWAY STATION INT DAY
ILSA buys a ticket She continues to head up the platform
An attractive well-to-do BUSINESSMAN turns to watch her pass
She walks with great purpose toward her train
And HARRISON steps out of the crowd blocking her path
She looks at him calmly HER EYES ARE DEEP GREEN
A LUGGAGE TRUCK carrying a YELLOW CANOE passes by them
HARRISON
Let me go with you Ill do
anything you say

She looks at him enigmatically The TRAIN WHISTLE sounds She makes a
decision

ILSA
Wait for me Ill call you

She kisses him PASSIONATELY and runs for her train

HARRISON watches the train doors close behind her and the train pull
out

PUERTO MATANZAS RAILWAY STATION EXT DAY
HARRISON emerges A MOTORCADE arrives carrying the GOVERNOR

TORRES leans against his police car watching the crowd
HARRISON comes up

TORRES
Jameson is gone Morales is dead

(shakes his head)
I was worried we would make a mistake

HARRISON
Sometimes mistakes are what make up
your life
HARRISON shrugs The two men watch the CROWD The ARMY
BAND plays something that sounds like Soy Chicano
TORRES considers this

DOWN THE STREET - ON A BALCONY RAIL

VICTORS PAN AM BAG balances held up by a MESS OF DACHSUND-SHAPED
YELLOW BALLOONS

As HARRISON and TORRES watch the bag EXPLODES in a flash of light
THE MONEY EXPLODES FROM THE BAG AND STREAMS DOWN TO THE STREET BELOW

The CROWD bellows excitedly and rushes away from the platform toward
the SHOWERING MONEY

As the GOVERNOR climbs the platform even the ARMY BAND runs away after
the money

The GOVERNOR stands alone

HARRISON and TORRES look at each other with horror RACE TOWARD THE
GOVERNOR

KABOOM
THE PLATFORM EXPLODES IN A LARGE WHITE FLASH
DOWN THE STREET

The CROWD dances catches the MONEY

The TRAIN snakes through the landscape

ILSA sits dining with the handsome BUSINESSMAN from the station
She looks abstractedly out the window as he pours her a glass of
champagne

FEMALE VOICE

As the two look at each other we TRACK BACK

Watching KATHERINE and ILSA from behind a newspaper is KENDALL JAMESON

THE COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRAIN EXT DAY

passage sets up a LOUD CAWING

The TRAIN disappears into a TUNNEL
