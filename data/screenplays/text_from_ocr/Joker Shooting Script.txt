FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
ii

This story takes place in its own universe It has no
connection to any of the DC films that have come before it

We see it as a classic Warner Bros movie Gritty intimate
and oddly funny the characters live in the real world and
the stakes are personal

Although it is never mentioned in the film this story takes
place in the past

Lets call it 1981

Its a troubled time The crime rate in Gotham is at record
highs A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past
six weeks And the divide between the haves and the have-
nots is palpable Dreams are beyond reach slipping into
delusions

TPSS
OVER BLACK
HEAR LAUGHTER
The sound of a man totally cracking up

FADE IN

INT DEPT OF HEALTH OFFICE - MORNING

CLOSE ON ARTHUR (30s) tears in his eyes from laughing so
hard Hes trying to get it under control His greasy black
hair hanging down over his forehead Hes wearing an old
faded green cardigan sweater a threadbare gray scarf thin
from years of use hangs loosely around his neck

Hes sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50s)
African American Her office is cramped and run-down in a
cramped and run-down building Stacks of folders piled high
in front of her

She just sits behind her desk waiting for his laughing fit
to end shes been through this before Finally it subsides

Arthur takes a deep breath pauses to see if its over
Beat

ARTHUR
--is it just me or is it getting
crazier out there

Despite the laughter theres real pain in his eyes
Something broken in him Looks like he hasnt slept in days

SOCIAL WORKER

Its certainly tense People are
upset theyre struggling Looking
for work The garbage strike seems
like its been going on forever
These are tough times

(then)
How bout you Have you been
keeping up with your journal

ARTHUR
Everyday

SOCIAL WORKER
Great Did you bring it with you

Beat
ARTHUR
(dodging the subject)
Im sorry Did I bring what

SOCIAL WORKER
(impatient she doesnt
have time for this)
Arthur last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you For
these appointments Do you have it

ARTHUR
Yes maam

Beat

SOCIAL WORKER
Can I see it

He reluctantly reaches into the pocket of his jacket hanging
on the chair behind him Pulls out a weathered notebook
Slides it across to her--

ARTHUR
Ive been using it as a journal
but also a joke diary Funny
thoughts or or observations-- Did
I tell you Im pursuing a career in
stand-up comedy

Shes half-listening as she flips through his journal

SOCIAL WORKER
No You didnt

ARTHUR
I think I did

She doesnt respond keeps flipping through his journal--
PAGES AND PAGES OF NOTES neat angry-looking handwriting
Also cut out photos from hardcore pornographic magazines and
some crude handmade drawings
A flash of anger crosses Arthurs face--
ARTHUR
I didnt realize you wanted to read

it

The social worker gives him a look then reads something in
the pages that gives her pause--
SOCIAL WORKER
(reading out loud)
I just hope my death makes more
cents than my life

She looks up at Arthur He just stares back Lets it hang out
there for a beat

Then he laughs a little even though he doesnt think its
funny--

ARTHUR
Yeah I mean thats just--

SOCIAL WORKER
Does my reading it upset you

He leans in

ARTHUR
No I just-- some of its
personal You know

SOCIAL WORKER
I understand I just want to make
sure youre keeping up with it

She slides his journal back to him He holds it in his lap

SOCIAL WORKER
How does it feel to have to come
here Does it help having someone
to talk to

ARTHUR
I think I felt better when I was
locked up in the hospital

SOCIAL WORKER
And have you thought more about why
you were “locked up

ARTHUR
Well I suppose I was mentally ill

SOCIAL WORKER
How’s that

ARTHUR
Well my mother thought I was
mentally ill so she had me
committed
SOCIAL WORKER
Did you feel mentally ill

ARTHUR
They’ve been saying that since I
was little So who knows

Long pause

ARTHUR
I was wondering if you could ask
the doctor to increase my
medication

The social worker ruffles through some papers--

SOCIAL WORKER
Arthur you’re on seven different
medications Surely they must be
doing something

Beat

ARTHUR
I just don’t want to feel so bad
anymore

And we HEAR TEMPTATION RAG playing on a broken down piano--

EXT GOTHAM SQUARE MIDTOWN - AFTERNOON - DAYS LATER

face Wide red smile outlined in black around his mouth
Bulbous red nose Bald cap with two patches of frizzy green
hair sticking out over the ears little bowler hat Too-
tight buttoned jacket Baggy pants and oversized colored
shoes This is his job

PULLING OUT we see hes holding a sign in front of Kennys
Music Shop that reads EVERYTHING MUST GO A banner above
the store reads GOING OUT OF BUSINESS Behind him an OLD
MAN plays an old piano on the busy street garbage bags piled
everywhere

Arthurs doing a little Charlie Chaplin like performance to
the music twirling the sign bringing attention to the sale
Hes pretty good feeling the music in his bones light on
his feet Still most people walk right past ignoring him

ARTHUR SEES A GROUP OF BOYS pointing at him from down the
street laughing at him One of the boys throws an empty
Coke can at Arthur as they get close Arthur holds up the
sign like a shield Coke can bouncing off it--

The boys walk up on Arthur He tries ignoring them keeps
dancing to the old ragtime holding up the sign as they
surround him One of the kids knocks the sign out of

Arthurs hands--

The other kids crack up Arthur bends over to pick up his
sign and Kicks it Attempts to pick it up again and
Kicks it again Its a bit

Arthur bends over a third time to pick up the sign and

One of the boys kicks him right in the ass--

Arthur falls face first onto the sidewalk Oddly the old man
playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--

The kids crack up One of the boys grabs Arthurs sign and
takes off running across the street--

The other kids follow weaving through traffic-—-

Arthur gets up and gives chase He needs his sign back

He almost gets hit by a taxi spinning out of the way just in
time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
of hitting him

Arthur keeps running through traffic People stare A clown
barreling down the street has got to be a joke--

EXT CORNER ALLEY - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

The five boys are booking it down the busy street laughing
and whooping it up At the last second they take a sharp

right turn down an alley--

Arthur almost overshoots the corner slip-sliding in his
oversized shoes--

He rights himself and heads down after them--
Sees them running up ahead--

WHAP Out of nowhere Arthur gets hit in the face
He falls to the ground

One of the kids was hiding behind a dumpster and hit Arthur
with the EVERYTHING MUST GO sign splintering it in two--

The other kids turn back and walk up to Arthur down on the
ground
Arthur reaches out still trying to save the sign--

THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Arthur
Its brutal and vicious Nobody on the street stops to help

CLOSE ON ARTHURS CLOWN FACE down on the ground Sweat
running down his face smearing his make-up Doesnt even

INT CITY BUS (MOVING) - HEADING UPTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Arthur sitting in the back of a crowded bus looking out the
window at the city passing him by his make-ups washed
off still see some white grease-paint smudged on the sides
of his face

He feels somebody staring turns to see a sad-eyed THREE-YEAR-
OLD BOY face puffy from crying sitting on his knees looking
back at him His mothers facing forward but even from
behind you can tell shes angry

Arthur doesnt know where to look feeling self-conscious and
small He gets back into character smiling like a clown and
covers his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-
boo game with him

The boy stares back at him for a moment then giggles--

WOMAN ON BUS
(turns back to Arthur
already annoyed)
Can you please stop bothering my
kid

ARTHUR
I wasnt bothering him I was--

WOMAN ON BUS
(interrupts)
Just stop

AND SUDDENLY ARTHUR STARTS TO LAUGH LOUD He covers his
mouth trying to hide it-- Shakes his head laughter pausing
for a moment but then it comes on stronger His eyes are
sad It actually looks like the laughter causes him pain

People on the bus are staring The little boy looks like hes
going to cry again

WOMAN ON BUS
You think thats funny

Arthur shakes his head no but he cant stop laughing He
reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card Hands it to
the woman

CLOSE ON THE CARD it reads Forgive my laughter I have a
condition (more on back)

She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information
in small writing--

Its a medical condition causing sudden frequent uncontrollable laughter that
doesn’t match how you feel It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain

neurological conditions

She doesnt read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you
could) She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card
on the ground

Arthur laughs harder Tears running down his face

Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself he
covers his mouth with his threadbare scarf trying to muffle
the laughter--

EXT THE BRONX STREET - SUNSET
The bus pulls away sun almost gone

Arthur heads slowly limping down the litter-covered streets
Garbage is piled along the sidewalks the air thick with smog
creates a haze over everything

The streets are crowded with the poor the elderly and
disenfranchised Women with children in busted strollers
Homeless people sleeping on subway grates Stray dogs His is
one of the few white faces

Arthur makes his way into a run-down drug store behind him
two drunks fight on the corner beating the shit out of each
other Arthur and nobody else for that matter pays them any
attention

No one here gives a shit
EXT SIDE ALLEY TENEMENTS - EARLY DUSK

apartment buildings Holding a small white (prescription) bag

at Arthur giving him shit in Spanish

EXT STEEP STAIRWAY TENEMENTS - DUSK

INT HA-HAS TALENT BOOKING LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Arthur is putting on his make-up using the small mirror in
his locker Behind him a couple other clowns are eating their
lunch at a small table not paying Arthur any attention

Arthur pauses half-finished and stares at himself for a
beat Hooks the corners of his mouth down with his index
fingers turning his mouth into the tragedy mask frown--

And then he pulls his fingers up pulling them up wider and
wider stretching his smile into a grotesque parody of the
comedy mask trying to make himself look happy pulling his
mouth so wide tears come to his eyes--

the seat next to him green wig on his lap

Subway car near empty Arthurs sitting across from a lonely-
looking MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN theres also a YOUNG WOMAN (late
20s) reading a book at the far end

Arthur glances at the Middle-Aged Woman maybe trying to make
a connection but the woman doesnt even notice him as the
train comes to a stop her heads somewhere else--

The woman gets off the train and THREE WALL STREET GUYS get
on Theyre loud and obnoxious clearly drunk One of them is
eating some french fries out of a greasy McDonalds bag He
flops down on the bench across from the young woman and
checks her out The other two guys start getting into it with
each other--

number We should have just stayed

The train starts moving again
WALL STREET 2

He starts dancing a bit with himself mimicking what he
remembers Wall Street 2 takes a swig from the brown bag he
is carrying

Arthurs watching them closely impressed by their confidence
and easy-going camaraderie

attention He has his eyes set on the young woman sitting
across from him reading her book

He holds out his McDonalds bag and shakes it to get her
attention The other two share a look Arthur watches from
his seat

some fries

She looks up and shakes her head polite smile

YOUNG WOMAN
No thank you

The other two guys crack up at this apparent blow-off The
third Wall Street guy shakes his head embarrassed and
starts softly flinging fries at the young woman

WALL STREET 3

She just buries her face deeper in her book--

WALL STREET 2
Dont ignore him Hes being nice
to you

One of the french fries lands in her hair She looks down
toward Arthur looking to see if hes going to do something
or say something--

Arthur just sits there nervous Not sure what to do or even
if he wants to do anything at all

AND HE JUST BURSTS OUT LAUGHING He covers his mouth with his
wig as they continue to harass the woman

They all look over-- What the fuck is this clown laughing at

WALL STREET 1
Something funny asshole

With their attention diverted the young woman rushes out
through the door between subway cars glancing back at Arthur
before she goes--

WALL STREET 3
(shouts after her)
BITCH

He laughs even harder through his green wig The Wall Street
guys turn to him sitting by himself at the end of the car--

Arthur sees them staring Looks down at the ground hand
still covering his mouth face turning red Subway swaying
lights flickering on and off

One of the guys heads down the car toward Arthur starts
singing Send in the Clowns as he approaches--

an end One of the other guys sits down on the other side of
him Hes now sandwiched in between them--

WALL STREET 2

nose He tries to get up but his feet slip from under him
and he falls back down--

his bag and his wig his hands shaking from the adrenaline

The train is coming to a stop

slowly turn his right arm rising slowly above his head as
his right foot leads turning like something is awakening
inside of him--

CLOSE ON WAYNE FAMILY PHOTO Arthurs fingers ripping it out
of the paper--

EXT WAYNE MANOR FRONT LAWN - SUNSET

Arthur walks down a small hill alongside an intimidating
brick wall surrounding the estate like a prison From this
angle hes able to peer over the wall catching a glimpse of
an innocent looking TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY tracking him from behind
the trees hiding as he follows

Arthur comes to the front A giant wrought iron gate We see
a long driveway that leads to the big house surrounded by
beautiful trees and plush green grounds

Arthur stops

He sees the boy approach but not get too close

Arthur reaches into his pocket and pulls out a magic wand--
He holds it up for the boy to see

The boy steps up to get a closer look

Arthur looks over the wand pretending like hes trying to
figure out what it does He waves the wand over the front

gate lock to try and see if it will open-- It doesnt

The little boy tentatively walks toward the fence face like
an angel

Arthur waits until he gets closer and then reaches his hand
through the fence and hands the kid his magic wand so he can
try and figure out what it does--

The boy takes the wand and it goes limp in his hand before he
can wave it-- He looks at it confused He hands it back to
Arthur

Arthur straightens the wand back out and reaches in through
the fence again so the kid can give it another try

And again the wand droops in the boys hand Disappointed he
gives it back to Arthur--

Arthur examines the wand as if its broken stiffens it one
last time crouches down lower and

Ta-da A bouquet of flowers bursts out the end of the wand--
Arthur hands the boy the wand bouquet of flowers--

The little boy takes the flowers Keeps staring at Arthur
not sure what to do or say Not smiling

Arthur looks back at him for a moment

THEN REACHES BOTH HANDS THROUGH THE GATE and firmly takes the
little boys face in his hands--

Uses his thumbs to hook the corners of the boys mouth and
pulls them up into a smile into a comedy mask--

The boy is okay with it puts his hands on top of Arthurs
hands They look at each other for a beat

ALFRED (OS)
(shouting)
Bruce

Arthur lets go The boy is now smiling on his own--
ALFRED (OS)

Bruce What are you doing Get away
from that man

Little Bruce stops smiling steps back from the gate

Arthur looks up and sees a tired-looking ALFRED PENNYWORTH
(50s) bounding toward them

Arthur stands back up

ALFRED
(still shouting)
What are you doing Who are you

Bruce runs behind Alfred hiding behind his legs

ARTHUR
Im here to see Mr Wayne--

ALFRED
(interrupting)
You shouldnt be talking to his
son Why did you give him those

thumping beat--

CUT TO

INT MOMS BEDROOM APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Arthur applying his moms lipstick outlining his large clown
smile sitting at her vanity in front of the three-way
mirror White grease-paint covering his face

He glances at a mask hanging off the corner of the mirror
Hes trying to copy how it looks A copy of a copy of
himself

He hears someone knocking on the front door--

Arthur opens a small drawer rummaging around looking for
something Finds some old rusty scissors and pockets them
Before he closes the drawer he notices some old photographs
of his mother Sees one that makes him stop He pulls it out--

ANGLE ON BLACK and WHITE PHOTOGRAPH OF A YOUNG PENNY laughing
at something or someone out of frame She looks so young and
beautiful and happy Flipping over the photo sees a
handwritten note on the back Love your smile-- TW

ANGLE ON ARTHUR staring at the note on the back as he hears
LOUDER BANGING on the door He glances up at his three
reflections in the mirrors--

INT FRONT DOOR MOMS APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Arthur unlocks the locks keeping the security chain latched
and cracks open the door-- Sees Randall Looks down and
sees Gary next to him Undoes the chain and opens the door
for them--

hair still wet streaking white grease-paint smeared over his
face red lips half done--

AND ARTHUR STABS THE SCISSORS AS DEEP AS HE CAN into
Randalls neck Blood spurts Randall screams Gary stumbles
back in shock--

GARY
(screaming)
What the fuck what the fuck WHAT

Arthur pulls them out and jams them into Randalls eye before
he can react The sound is sickening Garys screaming in the
background--

Randall blindly fights back screaming in pain flailing his
arms his own blood blinding him--

Arthur grabs Randall by the head -- all of his pent up rage
and frustration pouring out of him -- AND SLAMS HIS HEAD
AGAINST THE WALL

AGAIN And AGAIN And AGAIN
Arthur lets go of Randalls head and Randall drops to the
ground Arthur leans back against the wall out of breath
kind of slides down the wall to the floor--
Sees Gary huddled in the corner trembling with fear--
ARTHUR
(catching his breath)
Do you watch the Murray Franklin
show Im gonna be on tonight

Gary doesnt answer Doesnt move--

ARTHUR
Its okay Gary You can go

Gary backs away toward the door Arthur sits there for a
moment breathing heavy wipes Randalls blood off his face--

GARY (OS)
Hey Art

Arthur turns sees Gary at the front door He points up high
to the chain-lock He cant reach it

Arthur just shakes his head to himself and gets up to unlock
the door
He walks past Gary whos still trembling almost too afraid to
look up at him Arthur leans over him and undoes the chain
opens the door Gary takes off Arthur closing the door
behind him--

ANGLE ON ARTHUR leaning his back against the wall Takes out
a cigarette lights it with his left hand and smokes

Exhales deeply

Spanish Flea on a

loop a cacophony of noise competing video of Joker shooting
Murray interspersed with footage of rioting and fires
Indian-Head Test Pattern the only constant Its enough to

drive anybody crazy--

CUT TO

INT GOTHAM SQUAD CAR (MOVING) GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

DEAD SILENCE JOKER GAZING OUT THE WINDOW at all the
violence and madness in the city We only see it in the
reflection of the glass the fires burning the mob
crowding the streets Jokers handcuffed in the back of the
squad car moving slowly through the rioting sirens wailing
red lights flashing blood still splattered on his face

AND HE STARTS TO LAUGH Its not his affliction he just
finds it all so hilarious

POLICE OFFICER 1 (OS)
Stop laughing you freak This
isnt funny

AND JOKER JUST LAUGHS HARDER--

POLICE OFFICER 2
(glancing at Joker in the
back seat)
Yeah the whole fucking citys on
fire cause of what you did

JOKER STOPS LAUGHING AND LEANS FORWARD FACE PRESSED AGAINST
THE GRATE--

JOKER
I know Isnt it beautiful

AND BEFORE THE OFFICERS CAN ANSWER THE SQUAD CAR GETS HIT BY
A SCREAMING AMBULANCE SPEEDING LIGHTS FLASHING DOWN A CROSS
STREET--

VIOLENTLY CRASHING INTO JOKERS SIDE Joker flying like a rag
doll crashing against the opposite door glass spraying--

BOTH COPS BANGING AGAINST THE DASHBOARD AND DOORS bones
breaking screaming in pain and terror--

THE SQUAD CAR GETS PUSHED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC A yellow cab
headed straight for it swerves right to avoid clipping the
front end of the squad car and flipping onto its side

THE SQUAD CAR COMES TO A STOP in the middle of all the chaos
ambulance lights still flashing fires burning--

Nobody inside the wreckage moves Glass and twisted metal
everywhere Through the broken window looks like TWO MEN IN
CLOWN MASKS getting out of the ambulance--

ANGLE ON JOKER head slumped to the side face and mouth cut
up and bleeding blood smearing his dyed green hair

He looks dead And we HEAR the soft and familiar opening to
FERRANTE and TEICHERsS piano version of Send in the Clowns

SUDDENLY HANDS REACH INTO THE BACK OF THE SQUAD CAR hands
grabbing Jokers body pulling him out--

CUT TO

EXT MOVIE THEATER STREET - UPTOWN - NIGHT

A LIMOUSINE ON FIRE SLOWLY ROLLS THROUGH FRAME as if in slow-
motion we pan with it to--

A WELL-HEELED CROWD LETTING OUT OF A MOVIE THEATER coming
upon the car on fire realizing the violence has reached
here the nice part of town Gangs of punks wearing clown
masks running past breaking car windows sirens wailing
Catch a glimpse of the lit up marquee listing the films
playing Blow Out and Zorro the Gay Blade Hear Send in
the Clowns still playing

FROM BEHIND SEE A SILHOUETTED COUPLE AND THEIR KID hurry down
the dark side of the street ducking into an alley to avoid
the chaos--

Catch a glimpse of a punk in a Joker mask following after
them pulling a gun--

EXT ALLEY MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

FROM BEHIND FAMILY IN THE SHADOWS see the guys eyes go wide
behind the mask pointing his gun music swelling--

PUNK
(shouting)
Hey Wayne You get what you fucking
deserve

And the punk shoots the man Reaches out and grabs something
off the womans neck before he shoots her as well Both fall

to the ground dead Revealing their young son standing behind
them--

CLOSE ON EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE closing his eyes as
blood sprays across his face He opens his eyes and looks up
scared at the man in the Joker mask who killed his parents
Thomas and Martha Wayne

CUT BACK TO

EXT SQUAD CAR (CRASHED) STREET - NIGHT

FROM ABOVE JOKER LAID OUT ON THE HOOD arms spread his
hands uncuffed a crowd has started to form around the
wreckage checking out his broken body--

ANGLE ON JOKER A CROOKED SMILE PLASTERED ON HIS FACE
laughing coughing up blood The crowd steps back in
surprise Joker stumbles to his feet standing up on the hood
of the car--

Looks out at the city burning all around him the crowd at
his feet stunned thats hes alive And over it all Joker
HEARS A STUDIO AUDIENCE APPLAUDING

He raises a hands above his head does a little dance move
and the CROWD GOES CRAZY--

CLOSE ON JOKER tears in his eyes from all the pain and
suffering still he keeps smiling as he wipes his bloody hand
from one cheek across his mouth to his other cheek smearing
a wide blood-soaked smile across his face so they can all see
how fucking happy he is--

He is the Joker
CUT TO BLACK
A long beat
HEAR LAUGHTER
The sound of a man totally cracking up

FADE IN

INT ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING

CLOSE ON JOKER tears in his eyes from laughing so hard
Still smiling His heads been shaved hes wearing white
institutional clothes He looks medicated or maybe even
lobotomized

Hes sitting across from an overworked HOSPITAL DOCTOR
(50s) African American woman Somehow its the exact same
room Joker imagined his mother was in some 30 years ago The
room and the doctor also look vaguely similar to the social
worker and her office in the opening scene

The doctor just sits there waiting for him to stop laughing
A weathered notebook is on the table in front of him
Finally Joker stops himself
HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Whats so funny

He takes a deep breath his eyes are glazed over
is scratchy like he doesnt use it much But the
leaves his crooked lips

JOKER
--just thinking of this joke

HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Do you want to tell it to me

Beat

JOKER
You wouldnt get it

The doctor writes something down in her notes

HOSPITAL DOCTOR
How are you feeling

JOKER
Good Everythings good now

HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Have you been keeping up with your
journal

Joker slowly nods

HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Great Have you been writing about
what happened About your episode

JOKER
How I remember it

HOSPITAL DOCTOR
(re the journal)
May I see

Joker slides his journal across to her She picks
flips through the pages--

His voice
smile never

it up and

ANGLE ON JOURNAL blank page after blank page theres

nothing inside of it
The doctor looks up at him confused

Beat

ANGLE ON JOKER his smile creeping wider across his face And
we HEAR the groovy organ opening to FRANK SINATRAs anthem
Thats Life

Beat

INT HALLWAY ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING

From behind see Joker shuffling down the long hallway past
all the other mental patients Sinatra starts singing

And Joker does a slide step to the music like he can hear it
too into a skip and another slide step into a spin
Dancing down the hallway into the sunset

IRIS OUT

Thats Life keeps playing over credits
