ROLFE WHITEHOUSES VOICE thirtiesh articulate speaks over
credit tableaus

ROLFE (VO)
This is the story of my older
brothers strange criminal behavior
and disappearance We who loved him
no longer speak of Wade Its as if
he never existed By telling his
story like this as his brother I
separate myself from his family and
those who loved him Everything of

importance -- that is everything
that gives rise to the telling of
this story -- occurred during a single

deer-hunting season in a small town
in upstate New Hampshire where Wade
was raised and so was I One night
something changed and my relation to
Wades story was different from what
it had been since childhood I mark
this change by Wades tone of voice
during a phone call two nights after
Halloween Something I had not heard
before Let us imagine that around
eight oclock on Halloween Eve
speeding past Tobys Route 29 comes
a pale green eight-year-old Ford
Fairlane with a police bubble on

top A square-faced man wearing a
troopers cap is driving the vehicle
Beside him sits a child a little
girl with a plastic tiger mask
covering her face The man is driving
fast --

-- Route 29 tableau dissolves to night A pale green police
Ford Fairlane drives past

or just plum contrary

A shiny black BMW approaches speeding passing traffic on
the shoulder A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front
two children in back Whitehouse waves for it to stop

The BMW accelerates through the intersection ignoring Wade
and the traffic It whizzes past spinning Wade and is
quickly up the road spewing ice and exhaust Wade slips to

Specialists

ROLFE
(agreeing)
They wouldnt deal with a guy like
Jack Who else benefits if Twombley
The truck

is suddenly dead

WADE
(swigs)
I dont know You tell me

ROLFE
Okay Its likely there are people
in the union who dont want Twombley
to testify They probably include
his son-in-law whos vice-president
and will probably be the next
president I read that in the papers
Whats his name Mel Gordon

WADE
Yeah the guy with the BMW I told
you about I did didnt I

ROLFE
Heres my theory Twombley unaware
of illegal union loans or whatever
starts nosing around cause of the
investigation and finds out Finds
out his son-in-law is involved

WADE
So Mel Gordon wouldnt want a
professional hit Thatd make the
feds dig deeper He wants an accident

ROLFE
A hunting accident is perfect

WADE

Shit around here you shoot somebody
in the woods you say it was an
accident you get fined fifty bucks
and your hunting license lifted
Jacks probably saying the guy shot
himself cause he aint got his deer
yet and dont want his license pulled

sputters stops Wade pulls the keys

WADE
Its too neat Things aint that
neat It makes me mad That somebody
can pay to kill somebody his own
father-in-law and not be punished
for it Dont that piss you off

ROLFE
Not particularly

WADE
Rights right goddamnit Dont you
care whats right

ROLFE
I care about what happened The truth
Im a student of history remember

The sun is down Wade tucks the keys in a knotted board

ROLFE
I was thinking about that story you
told me about Pop and chopping the
firewood out of the ice and after

WADE
Yeah

ROLFE
I hate to disappoint you but I dont
think it happened

WADE
Of course it happened Why would I
lie about it

ROLFE
It may have happened but not the
way you said

WADE
You think I wouldnt remember a thing
like that

ROLFE

It wasnt me I wasnt there but I
heard about it When I heard about
it it was about Elbourne

WADE
Wed have to go digging in Vietnam
to ask him

ROLFE
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the
doctor and told him you fell from
the hay loft

WADE
(laughs)
Well I never heard that one

ROLFE
I remember clearly cause when I heard
I became real careful around Pop I
was a careful child and I became a
careful adult but at least I wasnt
afflicted by that mans violence
WADE

WADE
I dont know you My goddamn father

and I dont know you
Wade walks from the glistening snow into the dark barn
CUT TO

INT BARN - DAY

Wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office
belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the
ground He gathers up his rifles

Suddenly A whiskey bottle SLAMS against the back of his
head He drops to his knees the guns scatter He looks up
with childs fear and guilt at his father

Glen Whitehouse hovers over him huge and ferocious a
colossus lifting the bottle like a jawbone
Wade cringes scrambles for the dropped rifle He grabs it

by the barrel and twisting around swings it in a slow motion
arc smashing the edge of the wood stock against his fathers
head A cold hard CRACK of bone

Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again no longer mythic -- flies
back like a stuffed dummy He collapses beside the empty
CC bottle

Wade bleeding from the head stands staggers off Pops
inert body aims his rifle at the old mans face

WADE
I know you now I love you too

Wade bolts the rifle flicks off the safety fires -- a loud
CLICK The guns empty

WADE
(smiles)
Joke You scared me

He kneels down lovingly touches the old mans face caresses
his lips cheeks nose brows smoothes back his stiff gray
hair

Pops eyes are clouded Blood suddenly drips from his ear to
the ground

Wade rests the rifle against the truck He bends over slips
his hands under his fathers body lifts him up He carries
Pop over to the workbench lays him out

Groping beneath the bench Wade finds the kerosene lamp He
unscrews it pours kerosene the length of Pops body

Wade takes out his cigarette lighter ignites it holds it
for a moment places it to Glen Whitehouse

Fire spreads the length of Pops body bursting like a shroud
of yellow flame The oil-stained bench crackles flames shoot
up the old weathered wall

Burning flesh and heat drive Wade backwards
CUT TO
EXT WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Wade stands in snow and sunlight The entire barn is engulfed
in flames Black smoke billows through the clear winter sky
Inside Glen Whitehouse a pyre burns

ROLFE (VO)
The historical facts are known by
everyone -- all of Lawford all of
New Hampshire some of Massachusetts
Facts do not make history Our
stories Wades and mine describe
the lives of boys and men for
thousands of years boys who were
beaten by their fathers whose
capacity for love and trust was
crippled almost at birth and whose
best hope if any for connection
with other human beings lay in an
elegiac detachment as if life were
over

CUT TO
EXT PARKER MOUNTAIN - DAY

Pops red truck is parked behind Jack Hewitts 4x4 on a snow-
banked road Wade hunting rifle pointed up traces Jacks
footsteps down the slope of the mountain

ROLFE (VO)
Its how we keep from destroying in
turn our own children and terrorizing
the women who have the misfortune to
love us how we absent ourselves
from the tradition of male violence
how we decline the seduction of
revenge

Wade spots Jack poised in a spruce grove watching for deer
Wade bolts his rifle releases the safety aims and FIRES

Jack hit in the chest falls bleeding between trees Blood
stains the snow

ROLFE (VO)
Jacks truck turned up three days
later in a shopping mall in Toronto
Even without the footprints the
bullet Wades utter disappearance
seemed evidence enough of his guilt

CUT TO
INT WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Camera glides from room to room glimpsing details fragments
of former times as if this were an historical site or
memorial The walls resonate lives were molded here

ROLFE (VO)
LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed
in business The Parker Mountain Ski
Resort is now advertised all across
the country Jimmy Dame tends bar at
the lodge Chub Merritt opened a
snowmobile dealership Nick Wickham
runs the new Burger King Margie

Fogg moved to Littleton nearer her
mother Lillian and Jill went with
Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle

Out a window workers gather charred timbers from the barn
throw them on a truck

ROLFE (VO)
We want to believe Wade died died
that same November froze to death
on a bench or a sidewalk You cannot
understand how a man a normal man
a man like you and me could do such
a terrible thing Unless the police
happen to arrest a vagrant who turns
out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe
he wont be a vagrant maybe he will
have turned himself into one of those
faceless fellows working at the video
store and lives in a town-house
apartment at the edge of town until
his mailman recognizes him from the
picture at the post office -- unless
that happens there will be no more
mention of him and his friend Jack
Hewitt and our father The story
will be over Except that I continue

THE END
