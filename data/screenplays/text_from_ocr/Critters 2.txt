CALL OF THE CRITTERS

EXT PRIMORDIAL PLANET - NIGHT 1

Three MOONS glowing in different pastel COLORS light the STEAMY
MIST that fills the air Though it is night the light source
from the three globes filters through the constant mist and the
choking otherworldly VEGETATION

It is swampy humid oppressive A VOLCANO can be made out in
the distance through the colored mist and weird plantlife

RESPIRATOR SOUNDS Heavy BOOTS tromp into CLOSEUP Two pair
synchronized as they move through the MUCK A THIRD PAIR
follows clumsily and out of step

BLASTER WEAPONS nose through the vegetation They are big
capable of serious damage And then discovery

REVEAL a TINY SPACESHIP hidden in the lushness It is compact
large enough for a single pilot of completely alien proportion
but somewhat smaller than a man The ship appears disabled

The OWNERS of the BOOTS move into formation around the ship
They are BOUNTY HUNTERS wearing suits and helmets that allow
them to breathe here Two of them are large self-assured the
third a fumbler The new man Steam obscures their faces

The Big Two move as one They see signs of their quarry mucky
SMEARS of purple gluck on the sticky ground At the same
moment the Fumbler spots shining tasty-looking space fruit
glittering through the fog He hungrily begins the pick the
Fruit unaware that his partners are disappearing into the
night

INTO THE VEGETATION

The Big Two follow the alien gunk into even more dangerous
terrain their huge boots sucking muck with every step

RESUME ALIEN SHIP

The Fumbler excitedly stuffs the fruit into the pockets of his
suit in the mist-deadened eerie silence of this bizarre world
He turns to show off his find and is shocked to find himself
utterly ALONE

Faster RESPIRATOR SOUNDS

Panicking he sets blindly into the thick growth tripping and
falling faceplate-down into the muck The fruit splatters some
of it rolling away He gropes for then

As he reaches for one of them he suddenly stops short
FUMBLER’S P0V

There is a puddle right before him In the reflection we can
see something MOVING directly overhead in the vines

With slow dread the bounty hunter LOOKS UP

Hanging under the umbrella-like FOLIAGE is the bounty hunters’
quarry the HEXAPOD It is hideously insectile a four-foot
tall nightmare with a breathing apparatus that won’t hide its
hideousness It rears its mandibles and six legs wide as it
DROPS from the trees and onto the Fumbler

INCLUDE FUMBLER

Panicked he slips and slides in the muck unable to even get to
his feet before the thing drops upon him in hungry attack

Just as the horrible BEAST is on him there is a sudden BLAST
from the mists taking the Hexapod by surprise and splattering
his sickening entrails all over the Fumbler

The Big Two bounty hunters emerge from the foliage holstering
their blasters

The muck- and guts-covered Fumbler tries to get to his feet and
a knife is unsheathed The HEAD of the Hexapod is lopped off

« and dropped unceremoniously into a well-used GUNNYSACK

Acknowledging a job well done the Big Two toss the head in the
leaking bag to the Fumbler lock forearms and head back The
Fumbler disgusted by the head in his hands and the gore on his
chest sees he is about to be left alone again and scrambles to
his shaking slipping and sliding feet

INT BOUNTY HUNTERS’ SPACESHIP - DAY 2

An AIRLOCK WHISPERS OPEN The Big Two ENTER followed by the
Fumbler It is well-used lived in a bit on the junky side
Outer space equivalent of a ‘72 Chevy

As the DOOR SHUTS behind them suits and helmets come off We
are surprised by the face of the first one he doesn’t have any
He has a white featureless plasticine cheesehead He is LEE

His partner UG is an alien who has taken on the face of an
Earth rock’n’roller

The Fumbler struggles to remove his headgear It finally comes
off revealing the all-too-human slightly goofy visage of
CHARLIE MCFADDEN

CHARLIE
(breathing hard)
Jesus Mary and Joseph I was
almost bug meat
(remembering head in
his hands)
Here you guys want to take this

EXT PRIMORDIAL PLANET - NIGHT 3
Down-firing rockets ignite turning the mists to steam The
bounty hunters’ spaceship lifts from the ground

EXT SPACE 4
and slings out of orbit

RESUME INT SPACESHIP 5

Ignoring Charlie from their control chairs Lee pilots as Ug
manipulates his well-worn communicator he takes from his belt

Working behind them Charlie gingerly sets the bag on the
counter It falls open and the disgusting head of the Hexapod
is staring at him

Squeamish Charlie closes its eyes and-- using a weird MARKING
PEN-- marks a blank tag with alien SYMBOLS and wires it to the
vicious-looking mandibles

Charlie opens a cold-storage LOCKER Inside is an assortment of
horrible-looking CREATURE HEADS all different each one tagged
many staring lifelessly from the fridge Trying not to look

at the nightmare faces Charlie clears a shelf and stores the
Hexapod head He slams it shut quickly

CHARLIE
(shivering)
God I hate that part
ANGLE WITH UG AND LEE AT CONTROLS
The SCREEN in front of Ug blinks an alien message he doesn’t
like He speaks in an accent we’ve never heard before
UG
No pay on Krite kill

Lee mouthless doesn’t speak He emits a strange electronic
SOUND of confusion Lee is confused Ug is pissed Ug slips a
communication device out of his belt and sticks it into the
control panel

With the THWEEPING of electronics the HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE of
ZANTI APPEARS

ZANTI
Ah bounty hunters Have you
captured my convict already
CHARLIE
He sees Zanti unimpressed goes back to cleaning space fruit
INCLUDE BIG TWO AND ZANTI

Ug is angry

UG
Hexapod dead Why no pay on Krite
kill

ZANTI
Our agreement was for their total
elimination

UG
Eight Krites escape eight Krites
killed

ZANTI
An independent G-sweep of the
planet indicates residual Krite
ife

UG
G-sweep wrong

WITH CHARLIE

To prove it Charlie opens the fridge closes his eyes points
at the heads (shoot from behind we don’t see them but Zanti
does) then closes door

ZANTI
Possibly But the Council is very
nervous when it comes to the
Krites

ZANTI (Cont’d)
They are a plague and their
existence on any but the garbage
planets cannot be tolerated
Payment is withheld until you
return to Earth to verify total
elimination of Krite life--
residual or otherwise

That gets Charlie’s interest
CHARLIE
Earth We goin’ back home

ZANTI
(to the Big Two)
There must be no doubt

EXT SPACE 6
The ship makes a drastic course-correction doing an about face
and slashing across the starfield with a ROAR leaving the MAIN
TITLE in its wake
EXT KANSAS COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 7
A MONTAGE of comfortable rural sights vast honey-tinted fields
grazing cattle grain elevators windmills combines All of
them leading into a dying town

The land is slowly being abandoned for the city hundreds of
miles away

FINISH CREDITS

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY 8

A Greyhound BUS APPEARS over the horizon passing a sign that
places the tiny town of Grovers Bend three miles ahead

INT GREYHOUND BUS - DAY 9

The bus is nearly empty Halfway back a dark-skinned woman in
her thirties is nursing a baby her carpet bag at her feet

The only other passenger is up in the front behind the DRIVER
BRAD a red-headed sixteen-year-old boy is staring out the
window trying to keep from looking at the nursing woman

DRIVER
What takes you to Grovers Bend

Brad finds the driver’s eyes in the rearview mirror

BRAD
My grandmother lives there

DRIVER

Brad shrugs turns back to the window

DRIVER
You know what the Bend’s famous

BRAD

DRIVER
Han’t your granny ever told you
‘pout them Critter things

BRAD
(feigned ignorance)
What Critters

Of course the Driver doesn’t believe a word of it but plays it
up like a major local ghost story

DRIVER

bugaboos with teeth like your Aunt

unidentified flyin’ UFO or some
such Nasty little sonsabitches

BRAD
With the two-headed sheep that

Presley

DRIVER

BRAD

Browns

ON BRAD’S DUFFEL BAG

We see the nametag on Brad’s bag Bradley Brown Brad’s hand
drops down unconsciously to cover it

RESUME BRAD AND DRIVER

DRIVER
Pullin’ into the bend in just a
couple minutes now

He checks the mirror again but Brad is staring out the window
a million miles away The driver gives up turns the radio up

EXT “POLAR ICE BURGER PLANT - DAY 10

It is a warehouse of frozen hamburgers for a large chain of
fast-food restaurants The Happy Cow on the sign proclaims
frozen fresh for the finest in fast foooocd

The Greyhound bus heads toward the center of town A speeding
4X4 comes up from town honking and blasting heavy metal MUSIC
almost running the Bus off the road The bus JERKS aside and
the 4X4 races past narrowly avoiding disaster The Driver
BLASTS the AIR HORN

EXT HIGHWAY NEAR BROWN FARM - DAY 11
With the 4X4 Wesley an 18-year-old would-be rock’n’roller in
a Whitesnake T-shirt flips off the bus as it fades in the
distance He drives like a maniac while MR

QUIGLEY a middle-aged balding man more at home playing
checkers off a cracker barrel hangs on nursing a plain-wrap
beer shouting to be heard

QUIGLEY
This had better be worth it
Wesley

WESLEY
Just keep your seat dry We’re
almost there

EXT BROWN’S BARN - DAY 12

The farm is abandoned paint blistered boarded over FOR SALE
sign creaking and swinging over the NO TRESPASSING warning
Otherwise silence

A tumbleweed blows through the FRAME no one’s lived here for
two years

And then telltale rock’n’roll coming from the distance and the
4X4 SCREECHES into CLOSEUP throwing gravel and almost sending
Quigley over the windshield

He tries to catch his breath but Wesley is already out and on
his way He drains the beer can and follows

INT BROWN’S BARN - DAY 13

The barn is dark inside the DOORS are thrown OPEN and Wesley’s
SILHOUETTE comes inside followed by a breathless Quigley

WESLEY
Come on man Buried treasure
right this way

They make their way through the cobwebs and shafts of dust-moted
sunlight through the cracks It is eerie a bit spooky

QUIGLEY
What exactly are we looking for

WESLEY
Collector’s items Nothin’ like
‘em Just like all the other
weird shit you’ve got in your
store

He leads him into the bowels of the creepy old barn then starts
throwing a pile of hay to the dirt floor

Wesley GRINS as he finds what he is looking for

EGGS

He pulls away a last handful of hay and reveals a pile of
extremely unusual EGG-LIKE things They have a leathery skin
and are mottled with strange color

They look like prehistoric Easter eggs

WESLEY AND QUIGLEY

Grinning Wesley proudly shows his find Quigley looks from the
eggs to the boy baffled

QUIGLEY
What are they

WESLEY
I don’t know They’re whatever
you tell people they are You
could ask ten bucks apiece Maybe
more now that it’s Easter What
do you say

QUIGLEY
These things ain’t worth dick

WESLEY
Okay fine I’11 take ’em out
to KC see what I can get from
one of them big antique stores
Quigley doesn’t react
WESLEY
‘Course a case of Lone Star would
save me a lot of trouble
Quigley considers a moment then

QUIGLEY
Let’s load ’em up

WESLEY
All right
EXTINT BROWN’S BARN - DAY 14

They finish hefting the last of the eggs into the back of the
4X4 hop in and peel away leaving the barn doors swinging

The CAMERA MOVES through their dust into the hay to find one

there is a telltale TRAIL of SLIME leading from it as if
something came out of it and crawled away

EXT GROVERS BEND - DAY - INTRODUCTORY MONTAGE 15

It is bucolic peaceful long in the tooth a throwback to a
more innocent time It’s a lazy one-stoplight town

EXT GROVERS BEND GAZETTE - DAY 16

A small-bed delivery truck gears down to a swift stop The
unseen driver considers a tight parking space in front of the
town newspaper office

The driver makes a sharp turn backing it fearlessly into the
spot and finds there isn’t enough room to open the door The
driver climbs butt-first through the window falling onto the
HOOD of the car next to her

It is MEGAN MORGAN 17-year-old heartthrob and daughter of the
newspaper’s owner

MEGAN
Plenty of room

As she climbs around to heft a stack of newspapers from the
truck 70-year-old NANA appears on her daily routine She is
JOGGING sweating through her teen-fashion brightly colored
LEOTARDS leading a group of PRE-SCHOOLERS down Main Street

CINDY MORGAN Megan’s five-year-old sister is among them The
group rushes past Megan surrounding her briefly buffeting her

about

office
17 ‘INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY 17

It is a small homey office for a small homey paper MR
MORGAN Megan’s dad works over a lighted layout table with
SAL now a jane-of-all-trades here at the paper hovering over
his shoulder The LAYOUT is reflected in his GLASSES

The little paper consists entirely of Morgan Megan and Sal

MORGAN
Let’s pull the photo one column
to the left That way we keep
the 4-H Club sidebar and we can
swap the sidewalk weeds issue with
the Easter egg hunt right here

Newspapers under her arm Megan DINGS through the door
MORGAN
(without looking up)
Hi honey
MEGAN
Hi Dad I’ve got last week’s
returns

MORGAN
Just drop them back by the
typeset will you

She DUMPS them in the corner then goes over to look over their
shoulder at the LAYOUT

SAL
So what do we do with the blue-
ribbon thirty-nine pound squash

MORGAN
Bury it somewhere on page four
I thought you said it was
twenty-nine pounds

SAL
No way Thirty-nine I checked
the scale on old Jumbo myself

MORGAN
Better move it up to page two

Sal MOVES to get some COFFEE and Megan moves in for a closer
look at the layout She starts putting columns in place and
her dad SLAPS her hand and moves them back

MORGAN
We’re still looking at empty space
here

MEGAN

What about my story on the cherry
pit spit contest

MORGAN
(sarcastic)
I wanted to save that for the
monthly supplement Don’t we have
something a little more

newsworthy

INCLUDE SAL AT WINDOW 18

We can SEE through the picture window into the town square She
turns to watch the GREYHOUND BUS pull up outside and BRAD BROWN
disembarks

INT GAZETTE - DAY 19

CAMERA

SAL

MORGAN

one to give a shit

SAL

But this is big news in Grovers
Bend

(dramatic)
What happened to the family
Where are they now Did the furry
guys follow them there Inquiring
minds want to know

MEGAN
(finishing the familiar
commercial)
Like mine

MORGAN

Cute That might have been news
two years ago Sal but not any
more Nobody believes that
malarkey Grovers Bend just wants
to forget about that night

(beat)
We’ll fill with Megan’s cherry
pits

The Church tower tolls the noon BELL Sal is disheartened

SAL
There’s the noon bell Can you

Sal heads out Megan teases her father
MEGAN
Ooh you’re so gruff Just like

Morgan swats her butt

EXT HARV’S AIRSTREAM TRAILER - DAY 20
Outskirts of town It is a tumble-down structure alone and
depressing SAL pulls up in her VW BEETLE with the PRESS CARD
in the window and rushes up to the door

When she knocks on it it eases open The doorhandle won’t
latch

AT DOOR 21

The door opens to reveal HARV sitting in his underwear watching
a game show on his beat-up black-and-white TV

He looks up annoyed and embarrassed to be seen this way
especially by a member of the opposite sex

Sal turns away and Harv throws a towel around himself and
thunders to the door
HARV
What the hell are you doing here
SAL
Important business Brad Brown
is back in town
Harv REACTS to the name but feigns indifference
HARV
Well on the Important Chart I’d
put that just above pineapple

quiche and just below a pimple
on the ass

SAL
I thought you’d want to talk with
him Sheriff you know about the
Critters and all

HARV
And why in hell would I want to
do that If I never talk to
nobody about them things-that-
shall-notbe-named-in-my-presence
again I’1l die a happy man
Sides I ain’t been sheriff for
two happy years

Sal is disappointed Harv throws a look over his shoulder

HARV
Now be a good girl and go on
home Sal They’re goin’ into
the bonus round

SAL
(crestfallen)
Sorry to bother you Harv

Harv closes the door on her and she heads out

EXT QUIGLEY’S CURIOS SHOP - DAY 22

It is a tumble-down shack with ancient gasoline pumps and other
junk that won’t fit inside the store out on what once was a
lawn Very peculiar place lots of very strange GEEGAWS inside
and out

Wesley and Quigley PULL UP in the 4X4 and start to unload the
strange EGGS from the back

Wesley approaches the gate first and suddenly CHILI-DOG
appears snapping and foaming at Wesley who leaps out of the
way without dropping any eggs

WESLEY
Quigley Get your goddamn dog
outta the way

QUIGLEY
Chili-dog Go out back You
heard me you miserable
sonofabitch Go on

The dog just keeps barking and snarling at Wesley and Quigley
has to yank the dog by the collar and hook him to the chain
keeping him just out of reach

QUIGLEY
It’s just a dog pussy

WESLEY
So’s Cujo

And they carry eggs inside

23 INT QUIGLEY’S CURIOS SHOP - DAY 23

Creepy Lots of strange things taxidermy machines junk on
every shelf and counter

WESLEY

Where do you want this shit
QUIGLEY

Just dump ’em in the corner over

there

And they stack them up

WESLEY
So what about the brewskis

Quigley gestures at the opposite corner where a stack of cases
reach floor to ceiling

Wesley goes over to grab a case off the top

WESLEY
This is all that plain-wrap piss
We agreed on Lone Star

QUIGLEY
Ain’t got no Lone Star

WESLEY
(pissed)
Then I’m taking two

Quigley shrugs and Wesley grabs the beer Then he spots some
other worthwhile bounty a stack of PLAYBOY MAGAZINES on the
counter

WESLEY
An’ a couple of these

Before Quigley has time to object Wesley stuffs the magazines
under his arm and EXITS

QUIGLEY
I hate teenagers

From the yard we HEAR Chili-dog BARK viciously (os) and
Wesley YELLS There is a crash and then we HEAR the 4X4 fire
up and pull away (0os)
Quigley smiles and looks at the pile of eggs
QUIGLEY

Now what the hell do I do with

you
EXT BRAD’S GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY 24
It is a cute midwestern gingerbread house There is a sign in
front Nana’s Day Care Center There are big CUTOUTS of
animals and cartoon characters sticking out of the lawn

Brad carrying his duffel bag heads up to the door

INT NANA’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 25

Lots of drawings by children adorn the walls And a framed
photo of Jane Fonda in workout togs

Nana is serving a handful of kids their carrot and celery sticks
and yogurt when the DOORBELL RINGS

The KIDS frown as they are served One LITTLE BOY dares to
object

LITTLE BOY
Don’t you have any Twinkies or
Ho-Hos

NANA

(shivers at the thought)
Fresh vegetables are high in
fiber and you need fiber for a
healthy bm You don’t want to
get constipated do you

And she rushes to the door and is thrilled to see Brad there

NANA
Bradley Come in come in

BRAD
Hi Nana

To his tremendous embarrassment she hugs and kisses him the
Kids are giggling behind her

NANA
Look at you You’re shootin’ up
like a stinkweed
(sniffing)
You been eating red meat

BRAD

(guilty)
Just the occasional hamburger

NANA
Worst thing you could do to that
body Come in and have a good
snack with the children
He closes the door behind himself then remembering something

BRAD
Wait I brought you something

And he hands her a bag She is delighted wondering what it
could be It is a bag full of STRING and nothing could excite
her more She holds it up to show it to the kids
NANA
Children look More string

And they go over to add it to the four-foot STRING BALL in the
corner

NANA

You’ve always been the thoughtful
one Brad

BRAD
(diplomatic)
It’s from all of us

DISSOLVE TO

INT NANA’S ATTIC - NIGHT 26

We can see the slice of moon in the clear Kansas sky through the
window The attic is crammed with STUFF much of it from the
old Brown farn

Brad is picking through everything then finds a BOX marked with
his name He picks through it it brings back memories even
though he’s outgrown the CHERRY BOMBS SLINGSHOTS COMIC BOOKS
and POSTERS

And then something strange a big black ELECTRONIC DEVICE
the communicator He’d almost forgotten about that

BRAD
(a whisper)
The Communicator

Then continuing his search of the past he finds something at
the bottom of the box A couple pieces of paper

One of them is a SNAPSHOT from happier times Brad and Charlie
standing in front of the Brown farm arm in arm SLINGSHOTS
proudly displayed

A torn piece of PAPER flutters to his feet He picks it up
looks at it It’s a newspaper clipping There’s a picture of
Charlie there with the headline LOCAL RESIDENT DISAPPEARS

Brad becomes sad wistful

BRAD
(whispering to himself)
I sure do miss you Charlie
Where did you go to

The CAMERA MOVES from Brad and the clipping through the attic

and up to the window framing the haunting night sky In the

DISTANCE we can see one of the STARS softly STREAKING ACROSS
e SKY

He starts to go out but it’s getting a bit chilly He shivers
then grabs an old windbreaker and throws it on before he EXITS

There is a BREEZE and it blows the WINDOW OPEN We see the
haphazard pile of remaining EGGS in a pile by the corner next to

There’s something we can’t see in his bowl

We can HEAR something EATING-- wetly-- from the bowl Chili-dog
starts BARKING A WET SOUND on the floor behind him The dog
WHIPS his head around and faces something we ‘cannot see

bunny are right underneath next to a floor HEATER REGISTER
blowing forced HEAT into the room making the tassels on the
bedspread vibrate gently

onto the carpet

see is the Carob Bunny half-melted distorted

We BREAK FREE of the Egg and look around Cindy’s HAND drops
into the frame dangling from above We MOVE TOWARD IT and
HEAR an 0os STOMACH RUMBLE

The hand pulls away and we scope the joint We SEE a MAD BALL
toy SLITHER over to it and take a bite out of it It is spit
out

Tension building as Cindy’s arm and leg drop over the side we
know it’s only a matter of time before it bites Low creepy
speedy MOVEMENT Sniffing at the melting chocolate bunny

We HEAR RUSTLING in the bed above and Cindy starts COUGHING
os

We LICK OUR CHOPS and move out from under the bed and look up
at the little girl from the floor

and move it into sight

CINDY is the first to spot it She rushes up and kneels down
to pick up the Egg She reaches for it and when she touches
it its COLOR BRIGHTENS Cindy pulls her hand away fascinated

appearance Go on inside Cindy

As the children REACT we HEAR a GRUMBLE of Critter gibberish
it sounds a lot like oh fuck

She watches the children go then faces Quigley angrily noting
for the first time that he is drunk

NANA
Shame on you Len Letting those
little children see you drunk
And on Easter Sunday no less
You should be ashamed of yourself

saw that the stone was rolled

affrighted

Suddenly a stained-glass window IMPLODES A collective GASP

Moving closer he sees half-a-dozen BABY CRITTERS feeding on the
stripped carcass It is our first sight of them and they are
nasty red-eyed monsters that are all hungry maw

They’re done with the dog now Quigley is fresh meat

With an anguished cry Quigley lurches for the door but a gang
of Critters blocks his escape

ANGLE ON FLOOR

A Baby Critter darts from the shadows sinking its fangs into
his foot through the leather of his shoe

Quigley screams trying in vain to kick it off

More Critters appear gnashing viciously at his feet
Terrified he scrambles up onto an old bar stool The monsters
are all over the place

Terrified he sees them gathering at the base of the stool He
reaches for the ceiling cross beam but it is out of reach

The STOOL starts to SHAKE and there is a GNAWING SOUND
Quigley looks down his face falling

The Critters are chewing off a stool leg

With a CRACK the stool buckles throwing Quigley to the floor
Before he can even stand the Critters are on him like a cheap
suit

And she THROWS the ON-SWITCH The HAIR-DRYER WHIRRS to life
and the dome rattles even more beneath Sal as the Critter is
tortured by the heat

eases off the dome Instantly it flips over scaring the

It’s hard for him to see anything out here surrounded by brush
He takes a few more cautious steps turns to give a final
warning to Cindy

rides like the wind from the half-dozen Critters in her wake

We CRANE UP impossibly high above the church to see her trike
cutting a long swath through the wild grass Brad running
frantically to her aid

We can see the whole church and some of the townspeople in the
distance returning toward the front of the church from the town
center unaware of the drama behind but preoccupied with
troubles of their own

Some of them are gathering in the town square

Terrified she pedals like mad toward us and the Critter Balls
are closing in and a furious Brad is closing in on then

He WHAPS them from behind as hard as he can one after the
other but they keep coming back for more He hits and whacks
and beans them but they are resilient

And then Cindy’s trike finds a HOLE and she TUMBLES to the
ground

Brad DIVES for her crawling through the grass and STANDS
GUARD whacking them away with all of his might But he won’t
last long

He crouches down takes her in his arms

But they can see the Critters are regrouping all moving in at
once Cindy SCREAMS buries her face into Brad’s chest

Brad stands up wanting to be the hero holding her in his arms
but they are all rushing toward him It appears all must be
lost Her face is buried in his chest even he can’t look

But just as they are almost on them the Critters are BLOWN AWAY

their only hope against the Critters

Ug slowly faces him featureless

CHARLIE
Come on just try it

141 INT CHURCH - NIGHT 141

For a moment Ug faces Charlie and something seems to happen A
faint BLUE CHARGE and he seems to take on some of his old
rocknroll star features But he cant hold them The CHARGE

dissipates and leaves Ug a cheesehead

Brad gets up stands in the doorway looking out across the town
Megan follows stands behind him gently lays her hand on his
shoulder making him jump

MEGAN
Sorry

It just embarrasses him He looks away from her back into the
town which we see twinkling in the distance over his shoulder

It is eerily calm quiet

BRAD

It sure is quiet

You think its the lull before

He tries to see into the darkness
Nothing in the expanse before then

MEGAN

Maybe they’re all dead

BRAD
I wish They’re probably all

outside waiting for the right
second to chow down

She SHIVERS He’s sorry he said anything

BRAD
It’s like they’re teasing us or
something
(frustrated impotent)
I just wish we knew where they
were

He steps outside with her

little nervous but their guard seems lowered in the calm

BRAD
You guys see anything

They just give him a look of disdain as if Brad were

responsible for all of this

BRAD
It’s not my fault

But he’s talking to their backs

One of them shakes his head

Brad and Megan walk away from the others and a strange SOUND

wafts gently through the distance
MEGAN
Did you hear that
BRAD

Uh huh

Goosebumps

MEGAN
What was it
BRAD
Sssshh

The others outside heard it too It is the FEEDING SOUND Far
off ominous creepy Trying to see something-- anything-- he
and Megan walk around to the corner of the church looking out
over the horizon Brad SPOTS something

Look
ANGLE - BRAD’S POV - TOWN 145
‘Way off in town we can make out a few balled-up CRITTERS
rolling out of the deserted streets They are coming from
different directions but are all rolling the same way out
through the town and into the surrounding rolling FIELDS
RESUME EXT CHURCH 146
Megan grabs his arn
MEGAN
Where are they going
BRAD
(whispering)
Quiet
And they look off into the direction the Critters are headed
Some of the others inside the church have heard the sounds and
are gathering outside to see
Charlie and Ug come up behind them Though his shoulders sag in
near catatonia Ug seems to react to the sound A trace of
COLOR flushes his white featureless face

CHARLIE
Ug heard it too

The Critters’ feeding sound seems to be growing undulating on
the breeze hypnotic and gentle

But suddenly a HORRIBLE SCREECH rends the air An animal cry
of death Ug SAGS as the color recedes from his face again
MEGAN
(chilled to the bone)
Brad what was that

He’s as scared as she is but tries not to show it He knows
exactly what it was
Cattle
And she looks where he is looking

147 EXT FIELD BORDERING TOWN - NIGHT 147
So distant we can hardly make it out in the BLUE LIGHT of the
MOON A few head of cattle have been grazing in their field
but now their corral seems to be carpeted in FUR

The CRITTERS have blanketed the area as a few stragglers ROLL
into the FEEDING CAMP We are SHOCKED by their apparent NUMBER

148 RESUME EXT CHURCH 148

Brad takes her hand and leads her back inside the church

149 INT CHURCH - NIGHT 149

Brad charges in disrupting the nervous silence inside as the
wounded and the worried look up

He is uncomfortable being the center of attention
BRAD
The Critters are out in the fields
across town They found the
cattle
The members of the crowd REACT
A burly FARMER stomps up to Brad with disgust He shoves a
sausage-sized finger in Brad’s chest
FARMER
What are you doin’ back in Grovers
Bend boy

BRAD
(defensive)
I came back to visit my
grandmother for Easter Any law
against that

FARMER
Just seems mighty queer to me
first time the critters come it’s
at the boy’s house Boy comes
back to town and the damned
things come back too

ME
(irate)
Don’t be stupid Brad didn’t
bring them here It’s just a
coincidence that’s all

FARMER
Funny-ass coincidence if you ask
me

MURMURS of agreement Some start to shout from the pews

FARMER’S WIFE
It’s the boy’s fault

SCARED MAN
It’s true Wherever he is them
Critters turn up

VOICE
He brought ’em back

The frightened crowd is turning ugly converging on little Brad
Back in the corner Harv is nonchalantly reloading his pistol

Mr Morgan sweating propping himself up as he holds his little
girl’s hand steps to the head of the crowd

MORGAN
Let’s not get hysterical here
The boy saved my daughter’s life
We’ve got to band together and
fight these things

But the threat is cut short by GUNFIRE and everybody BACKS AWAY
with a gasp

HARV
keeps his gun held high and the Farmer drops Brad to the floor

BRAD
Thanks Harv

HARV
What is this bullshit The
goddamn town’s run rotten with
them hungry little fuckers and
you’ve got to play hackeysack with
some punk kid Seems to me it’d
make a lot more sense to figure
out a way to save our asses Now
let’s get organized

It sinks in The townspeople back off get a little more
reasonable Brad stands up and Megan goes to his side

MEGAN
You okay
He nods embarrassed
VOICE
I say we call in the state
militia

How you gonna do that when the
phone lines are all down

VOICE 3
We’ve got to evacuate

WESLEY
The critters have blocked the road
out of town Can’t get past ‘em

HARV

eads make some kind of plan
We can’t run from ’em anymore

sonsabitches head on

Yeah but how The townspeople try to think of what they can
(

BRAD
We’ve got to trap ’em and blow
‘em up

HARV

Weve got us a serious problem
here boy let’s forget about your
adolescent preoccupation with
pyrotechnics for the moment

They look at Harv where’d he get those 64-dollar words

BRAD
(getting inspired)
No for real Charlie didn’t
you say they get together to eat
Like in groups and stuff

(nodding)
Yeah that’s what Ug said

You can look out in the fields
and see for yourselves So let’s-
put out the most outrageous
banquet in the world for them
We’ll lure them together for food
and then blow the shit out of

em

HARV
What do you got in mind an
invitation only barbecue

BRAD
Ice Burgers We get them into
the hamburger factory trap them
inside and blow it up

ANOTHER VOICE
What makes you think they’1ll want
hamburgers when they got a human
smorgasbord right here

BRAD
It’s the only chance we’ve got
Anyway you should have seen them
chowing down at the Happy Cow
Everybody is mulling it over The crabby Farmer calls out

- FARMER
So who’s gonna lead this suicide
mission

Silence as everybody looks around Of course the center of
attention is the boy with the brainstorm Brad steps forward

BRAD
It was my idea But I’m gonna
need help

The crowd QUIETS No one moves forward to join hin
MEGAN

I don’t believe it A
sixteen-year-old kid is the only

Hamburger Plant

At the EDGE of the encampment a JUMBO CRITTER twice the size
of the biggest one we’ve seen before pops up out of the grass

It STANDS at full attention and begins to emit the Critters’
familiar FEEDING SONG

It is louder deeper more seductive than we’ve heard before
and the SOUND seems to gain the attention of the mass of
Critters in the camp

One by one Critters POP UP from the grasses curious about the
Big Guy seduced by the song

The Critters are IMPRESSED by the size and leadership of the
Jumbo Critter They are getting excited restless and begin

pops up tall at e head of the group He stops in front of
them halting their progress and crescendos the hypnotic SOUND

The Critter Camp calms falls into sync with the sound allows
him to take control again

Miraculously Jumbo leads the camp back toward the Hamburger

But as he leads something strange happens a HUMAN-LOOKING —
EAR seems to sprout from the side of his head And has his gait
changed He reaches up trying to cover it

resumes his human form The Critters become aware of the
stranger in their midst and swarm over him devouring him as
he FIGHTS like a battallion

Brad watches in horror as Ug sacrifices himself and the last
of the straggling Critters pour into the hamburger plant for
