OK so here it is The entire script to Clueless
including important actions songs from the
soundtrack and my own personal comments

Just hit the little speaker next

to the characters name to hear the lines from the movie
(Theyre

not working yet) I hope you enjoy reading it as much as
I enjoyed

writing it Its amazing the things you pick up when
watching a scene 50

times One thing this is written by a hopelessly devoted
and loyal Alicia

Silverstone fan so some of the commentary may be biased
But I figure

if youre reading this then you must have some interest
her Enjoy

Any suggestions errors anything Please email
me pacey578rocketmailcom

SCENE IV - CLASSROOM DEBATE

MR HALL

Should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in America
Amber will take the con position Cher will be pro Cher
two minutes

CHER

So OK like right now for example the Haitians

need to come to America But some people are all What
about the strain

on our resources But its like when I had this garden
party for

my fathers birthday right I said RSVP because it
was a sit-down dinner

But people came that like did not RSVP so I was
like totally

buggin I had to haul ass to the kitchen redistribute
the food squish

in extra place settings but by the end of the day it was
like the more

the merrier And so if the government could just get to
the kitchen rearrang

some things we could certainly party with the Haitians
And in conclusion

may I please remind you that it does not say RSVP on
the Statue of

Liberty
(Class breaks into applause)

CHER

Thank you very much

MR HALL

Uh Amber Replying

out of nowhere

CHER VO

campaign to my congressman about violations of the clean
air act

But Mr Hall was totally rigid He said my debates

were unresearched unstructured and unconvincing AS IF

I felt impotent and out of control which I really
hate I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could
gather my thoughts

and regain my strength

SCENE VIII - THE MALL

DIONNE

Dude whats wrong Are you suffering from buyers

remorse or something

(Watch Cher flick her head)

CHER

God no Nothing like that Its just that weve

aptitude but

I was brutally rebuffed

DIONNE

Mr Hall sublimely happy

SCENE IX - SCHOOL

CHER VO
Heres the four-one-one on Mr Hall Hes single

What that man

needs is a good healthy boinkfest Unfortunately there
was a major babe

drought in our school The evil trolls from the math
department were actually

married oooh Snickers and in the grand tradition
of PE teachers

s Stoeger seemed to be same-sex oriented Of course
there was always

iss Giest Something told me not to discount Miss Giest
Well sure she

has runs in her stockings and her slip is always
showing and she always

has more lipstick on her teeth than her mouth God this
woman is screaming

for a make-over Im her only hope

(Cher is writing a note outside

Miss Giests pidgeon hole)

TRAVIS

This is so unexpected I uh I didnt even have a

speech prepared Uh but I would like to say this
Tardiness is not something

you can do all on your own Many many people contributed
to my tardiness

Uh Id like to thank my parents for never giving me a
ride to school

the LA city bus driver for taking a chance on an
unknown kid and uh

last but not least the wonderful crew at McDonalds for
spending hours

making those egg McMuffins without which I might never
be tardy

MR HALL
Well if Mr Berkenstock has no political messages

to include in his speech Ill go on Cher Horowitz two
tardies

CHER

I object Do you recall the dates of these alleged

tardies

(Cher in lawyer mode Legendary)

MR HALL

One was last Monday

CHER
Mr Hall I was surfing the crimson wave I had to

haul ass to the ladies’

MR HALL

school with any intelligence

hire a gardener

JOSH

You know maybe Marky Mark wants to use his popularity

for a good cause make a contribution In case you have
never heard of

that a contribution is the giving of

CHER

Excuse me but I have donated many expensive Italian

outfits to Lucy

JOSH
time funds

CHER

And as soon as I get my licence I fully intend to

brake for animals and I have contributed many hours
helping two lonely

teachers find romance

JOSH
