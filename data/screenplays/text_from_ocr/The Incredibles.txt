TITLE
THE INCREDIBLES

MUNICIBERG - STREETS - MOVING LATE AFTERNOON

SIRENS WAIL Lights FLASH We’re in the middle of a
Classic CAR CHASE A police car in HOT PURSUIT OF anothe
car driven by armed BANK ROBBERS

The robber riding shotgun primes his SUBMACHINE GUN and
unloads on the cop car which SWERVES into oncoming
traffic to avoid the hail of bullets

INSIDE ANOTHER CAR NOT FAR AWAY

BOB PARR a dashing golden-haired man in his late
twenties listens to his radio If he looks familiar it’
because he is the same man we saw earlier MR INCREDIBL
sans mask and Supersuit Suddenly the music is
interrupted by an ANNOUNCER--

RADIO
We interrupt for an important bulletin a
deadly high-speed pursuit between Police
and armed gunmen is underway traveling
northbound on San Pablo Boulevard

Bob presses a button The RADIO flips converting to a
screen filled with a moving aerial map of the city
streets He types in “ISOLATE PURSUIT” 2 RED DOTS
appear moving quickly over the map

He makes a hard right turn Looks at the screen A tiny
“i icon (Mr Incredible’s logo) closes in on the 2 red
dots He checks his WATCH--

BOB
Ive got time

-and presses another button “AUTODRIVE” and types in
“MERGE PURSUIT”

Bob takes his hands off the wheel and a rapid series of
automated actions begin the seat back drops FLAT the
passenger seat folds against the window as the drivers
seat slides to the center

Bob raises his arms as metal bands lock around his waist
then SEPARATE sliding apart toward his head and his
toes removing his clothes to REVEAL his slick brightly
colored MR INCREDIBLE SUPERSUIT underneath

He presses another button the car’s exterior CONVERTS
into the coolest retro-futuristic vehicle ever seen The
INCREDIBILE MR INCREDIBLE looks up

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

we see an OLD LADY waving us down

OLD LADY
Mr Incredible Oh-- MR INCREDIBLE

RESIDENTIAL STREET
Mr Incredible pulls up His window WHOOSHES open

MR INCREDIBLE
What is it Ma‘am

OLD LADY

(pointing to tree)
My cat Squeaker won’t come down

Incredible glances at his screen the pursuit is headed
his way He thinks making some quick calculations then--

MR INCREDIBLE
Certainly Ma‘am But I suggest you stand
clear there could be trouble

OLD LADY
Oh no he’s quite tame--

RESUME PURSUIT - SAME MOMENT

The COP CAR pulls back in behind the robbers’ car The
cops are firing now and closing in

INCREDIBLE and THE CAT TREE

Nervously checking the pursuit on his video screen
Incredible rips the tree out of the ground He tips it
leaning it across to the lady just as the CAR CHASE
squeals into view at the end of the block Incredible
sees this and hastily SHAKES the tree trying to dislodge
the cat

INTERCUT

The CAR CHASE The cars swerve into view now bordering

the park that Incredible is in Incredible SEES them and
shakes the cat harder Chase cars close in Incredible

Car chase The cat Chase Cat--

One final SHAKE Squeaker drops into the OLD LADY’S
hands Incredible raises the tree up and SLAMS it down on
the hood of the crooks’ car squashing it like a bug
LATER

Incredible TAMPS down the loose dirt at the base of the
freshly replanted tree and smiles at his admirers

COP 1
Thank you Mr Incredible youve done it
again

COP 2

Yeah you’re the best

MR INCREDIBLE
I’m just here to help

RADIO
Attention We have a tour bus robbery in
the vicinity of Paradise and Solano-

Incredible FROWNS and looks at his watch He makes a
calculation muttering to himself

MR INCREDIBLE
I’ve still got time
(giving each admirer a nod)
Officers Ma’am “Squeaker”

He jumps into the INCREDIBILE and is startled to find a
pudgy kid wearing a mask and a homemade Superhero costume
sitting in the passenger seat

MR INCREDIBLE (CONTD)
Who are you supposed to be

BOY
Well I’m INCREDIBOY

Mr Incredible stares warily at the awkwardly costumed
kid He’s starting to look familiar

BOB
No no Youre that kid from the fan
club B Bro-phy Bud BUDDY Buddy

BUDDY
(frowning)
My name is INCREDIBOY

BOB
Look I’ve been nice I’ve stood for
photos signed every scrap of paper
you’ve pushed at me but this is a bit--

BUDDY
You don’t hafta worry about training me
I know all your moves your crime-
fighting style favorite catchphrases
everything I’m your number one fan

The passenger door WHOOSHES open and “IncrediBoy” is
ejected from the car Incredible fires the afterburners
and peels off leaving Buddy standing alone

CITY ROOFTOPS - MINUTES LATER

A trail of stolen goods scattered across a rooftop leads
us to a THIEF He mutters to himself as he roots through
a stolen purse disregarding some items stuffing others
into his pockets A SHADOW looms on the wall behind him

MR INCREDIBLE (0S)
You know--

The snatcher LOOKS UP Incredible grins

MR INCREDIBLE (CONT’D)
--you can tell a lot about a woman by the
contents of her purse But maybe that’s
not what you had in mind

Incredible closes in on him The snatcher drops the
purse pulls a gun An ARM suddenly STRETCHES into frame
and delivers a right cross to the snatcher’s jaw--
knocking him OUT COLD

Incredible looks up and sees a dazzling MASKED WOMAN in
an equally dazzling suit She SMILES

MR INCREDIBLE (CONTD)
Elastigirl

ELASTIGIRL
Mr Incredible

Elastigirl moves to the snatcher begins to pick him up--

MR INCREDIBLE
Its alright I’ve got him

ELASTIGIRL
Sure you’ve got him I just took him out
for you

MR INCREDIBLE
Sure you took him out His attention was
on me

ELASTIGIRL
A fact I exploited in order to do my job

MR INCREDIBLE
My job you mean

ELASTIGIRL
A simple “thank you” will suffice

MR INCREDIBLE
Thanks but I don’t need any help

Elastigirl assesses him Slowly moves closer

ELASTIGIRL
What ever happened to “ladies first”

MR INCREDIBLE
What ever happened to “equal treatment”

CROOK
(regaining consciousness)
Hey look the lady got me first

Elastigirl coldcocks the crook with one stretched punch

ELASTIGIRG
We could share you know

MR INCREDIBLE
I work alone

Elastigirl smiles moves very close to Incredible

ELASTIGIRL
Well I think you need to be more--

In one fluid motion she LOOPS around his body suddenly
behind him and before he can turn-- back in front again

ELASTIGIRL (CONT’D)
--flexible

MR INCREDIBLE
(dazzled)
You doing anything later

ELASTIGIRL
I have a previous engagement

She makes a little stutter step to the edge of the roof
and jumps flips loops and STRETCHES across the rooftops
like a liquid cat disappearing into the setting sun
MR INCREDIBLE lets out a low whistle That Is a woman
MOMENTS LATER
Incredible handcuffs the purse-snatcher to a pipe
MR INCREDIBLE
Now you just stay right here They
usually pick up the garbage in an hour

FROZONE (0S)
Hey Incredible

Incredible turns A HELICOPTER sweeps past machine guns
blazing back towards its pursuer FROZONE swoops down
hot on its tail surfing a sheet of ice that materializes
in his path

( )

MR INCREDIBLE
Frozone

Frozone LEAPS grabbing on to one of the chopper’s skids

FROZONE
Shouldn’t you be getting ready

Incredible frowns glancing at his watch He yells at the
retreating copter

MR INCREDIBLE
Hey I’ve still got time

Offscreen a woman screams--

WOMAN (0S)
HE’S GOING TO JUMP

Incredible runs to the edge of the building and looks
down A large crowd is gathered on the streets below
incredible follows their upwards gaze to the roof of a
skyscraper where a man stands poised to jump--

-then DOES Incredible quickly gages distances and then
dives off the edge making a spectacular LEAP--

HIGH ABOVE THE STREET

-and TACKLES the jumper in mid-air They crash through
an enormous window on the far side

INSIDE BANK BUILDING — LOBBY AREA
--and tumble to the floor in a shower of glass Safe

JUMPER
My collarbone-- I think you broke it

MR INCREDIBLE
With counseling I think you’1l come to
forgive me
(senses something)
Wait a minute

Mr Incredible slides the jumper over to a desk and props
him up against it His acute senses turn his attention to
the hallway toward the elevators As he follows his ears
we become aware of a sound a tiny series of regular
BEEPS INCREDIBLE locates a spot on the wall and presses
one ear against it The BEEPS ACCELERATE Bob starts to
push away and--

BOOOCOOOM

The hallway is filled with smoke and debris A SILHOUETTE
emerges from the newly blown hole in the wall a tall
rangy man in a mime costume carrying two stuffed duffle
bags He surveys the scene with a wicked smile

A VAULT DOOR is embedded into the wall directly opposite
the hole It moves aside revealing Incredible behind it
dazed but unharmed He sees the mime and GROWLS

MR INCREDIBLE (CONT’D)
Bomb Voyage

BOMB VOYAGE
(in French subtitled)

VOICE
And-- INCREDIBOY

Both Mr Incredible and Voyage turn and stare in
disbelief at the kid who awkwardly flies over to them

You always ALWAYS tell people “Be true
to yourself” but you never say which
part of yourself to be true to Well
Ive finally figured out who I am and I’m
your ward IncrediBoy

BOB
And now you’ve officially carried it too
far Buddy

There is an ugly flash in Buddy’s eyes

BUDDY
It’s because I dont have powers isn’t

MR INCREDIBLE

BOMB VOYAGE

BUDDY

As Buddy jogs to the shattered window Incredible sees
that Voyage has clipped a SMALL BOMB onto Buddy’s cape

MR INCREDIBLE
Buddy- DON’ T--

BUDDY
ItIIl only take a second really

MR INCREDIBLE
(takes off after him)
No- STOP THERE’S A BOMB--

He grabs Buddys cape just as “INCREDIBOY” TAKES OFF
taking Incredible with him

ABOVE MUNICIBERG MOVING - NIGHT

INCREDIBLE and THE BOY rocket wildly out of control
spraying sparks in every direction Mr I grabbing at the
i cape desperately for the bomb

BUDDY
Let go Youre wrecking my flight
pattern Let go of my cape Youre gonna

INCREDIBLE finally grabs hold of the bomb and flings it
free Both he and the BOMB fall onto the elevated train
tracks below The bomb EXPLODES blowing away a large
section of track Incredible groggily LOOKS UP

A TRAIN is coming And heading straight for the section
of track that is NO LONGER THERE

( )

ii

T ) Incredible sets his jaw and starts running toward the
oncoming train leaping the chasm to intercept the train
before it gets there

He pulls up and plants himself The expression on his
face says it all this is going to hurt

The train HITS-- Mr Incredible taking the full impact
Rail ties break behind Incredible’s feet spraying in all
directions as Incredible -miraculously-- wrestles the
train to a stop

STREETS BELOW TRESTLE LATER

Police and Paramedics have arrived cordoning off the
accident scene and treating the injured Mr Incredible
hands Buddy over to the police

MR INCREDIBLE
Take this one home and make sure his mom
knows what he’s been doing

BUDDY
I could help you You’re making a mistake-

The cops shove Buddy into the backseat of their car

MR INCREDIBLE
The injured jumper-- you sent paramedics

COP
Theyve already picked him up

MR INCREDIBLE
The blast in that building was caused by
Bomb Voyage who I caught in the act of
robbing the vault We might be able to
nab him if we set up a perimeter--

COP
You mean he got away
MR INCREDIBLE BUDDY
Well yeah Skippy here IncrediBoy

MR INCREDIBLE
(climbing into the car)

He fires the afterburners The cops watch in dismay as
the Incredibile roars off

He moves Right THERE Right as I’m
sitting down I den’t know how he does it-

Kropp forwards and rewinds back and forth Though Dash’s
image does “pop” a bit he remains clearly in his seat

KROPP (CONT’D)
--but there’s no tack on my stool before

tack Coincidence I think NOT

the kitchen

Dash and Violet swap GLARES All resume eating Then--

DASH
She’d eat if we were having Tonyloaf

VIOLET
THAT’S IT—

Violet LUNGES across the table VANISHING (save for her
clothes) They wrestle Dash escapes racing around the
table in a BLUR SLAPPING at the back of Vi’s head before
erashing into a FORCE FIELD she throws in his path

DASH VIOLET
OW No force fields You started it

HELEN
Stop it Dash Violet

Helen’s arms STRETCH across the table as she struggles to
keep the KIDS apart Jack-Jack LAUGHS loving the chaos

INSIDE THE KITCHEN

Oblivious to the melee Bob gets a new plate from the
cupboard still perusing the newspaper The headline
reads “PALADINO MISSING” With it is a photo of a lean
striking man early forties sporting wraparound
sunglasses and a full head of blonde hair

BOB
(V0 READING)
Simon J Paladino long an outspoken
advocate of Superhero rights is missing
(mutters to himself)
Gazerbeam

HELEN (0S)
Bob Its time to engage Do something

Bob snaps out of it turns toward the dining room
RESUME DINING ROOM

Bob ENTERS-- startled to see the CHAOS

HELEN
Don’t just stand there I need you to
intervene

BOB

Okay- I’m intervening I’m INTERVENING

Bob hoists the dinner table and everyone with it over his
head Dash and Vi dangle from Helens tangled arms and
continue to scrap Jack-Jack shrieks happily

The DOORBELL rings Everyone FREEZES then quickly resume

their original “quiet dining” positions Dash answers the
door

( )

LUCIUS BEST (aka FROZONE) stands in the doorway looking
sharp in a leather jacket Like Helen he too has
weathered the post-Superhero years well

DASH
Hey Lucius

FROZONE
Hey Speedo hey Helen--

BOB
Ice of you to drop by

FROZONE
(sarcastic)
Hah Never heard that one before

DASH
(mouth full of water)
Hey Lucius

Lucius turns to see Dash spurt a mouthful of water into
the air Best’s hand flashes out the air CRACKS with a
sudden chill and the water FREEZES SOLID Lucius LEAPS
catches the ice before it hits the ground Dash sinks
back disappointed

DASH (CONTD)
Aww IT like it when it shatters

BOB
(grabs his coat bowling bag)
I’ll be back later

HELEN
Where are you two going
BOB
It’s Wednesday
HELEN
(remembering)
Bowling night
(resigned)

Say hello to Honey for me Lucius

FROZONE

Bob and Lucius EXIT closing the front door behind them
Helen turns to Dash

( )

HELEN
Don’t think that youve avoided talking
about your trip to the Principals
office young man Your father and I are
still going to discuss it

DASH
I’m not the only kid whos been sent to
the office yknow

HELEN
Other kids don’t have Superpowers Now
it’s perfectly normal for you to feel-

VIOLET
Normal What do you know about normal
What does anyone in our family know about
normal The only normal one is JackJack

HELEN
Now wait a minute young lady--

VIOLET
We ACT normal I want to BE normal The
only normal one is JackJack and hes
not even toilet-trained

Buoyed by hearing his name Jack-Jack gleefully spits a
mouthful of baby food onto his bib and cracks up

DASH
Lucky
(off Vis and Helen’s looks)
Uh I meant about being normal

INSIDE LUCIUSS CAR - CITY STREETS - MINUTES LATER

Bob and Lucius sit in Lucius’s large comfortable sedan
which is parked in a run-down city neighborhood A
portable POLICE SCANNER sits on the dashboard volume
low occasionally interrupting his story

FROZONE
»SO now I’m in deep trouble I mean one
more jolt of this death ray and I’m an
epitaph Somehow I manage to find cover
and what does Doctor Toxic do

BOB

(laughing)
He starts monologuing--

FROZONE
He STARTS MONOLOGUING He starts like
this prepared speech about how feeble I
am compared to him how inevitable my
defeat is how the world will soon be his
yadda yadda yadda-

BOB
yammerin’--

FROZONE
YAMMERIN’ I mean the guy has me ona
platter and he won’t shut up

SCANNER
Six one sam eight Municiberg
(police response)

Weatherford Way--

Bob turns up the volume suddenly intense

BOB
2356 What is that-- robbery

FROZONE
This is just sad

BOB
Yeah robbery Wanna catch a robber

FROZONE
Tell the truth Id rather go bowling
What if we actually did what our wives
think were doing for a change

EXT LUCIUS’S CAR

WIDEN to REVEAL the silhouette of a WOMAN watching Bob
and Lucius from the driver’s seat of a black sports car
discreetly parked in a dark alley She lowers her
binoculars and speaks into a headset

MIRAGE
He’s not alone The fat guy’s still with
him Theyre just talking

RESUME FROZONE and BOB

FROZONE
Whatre we doin’ here Bob

(

s

BOB
Were protecting people

FROZONE
Nobody asked us

BOB
You need an invitation

FROZONE
Id like one yes We keep sneaking out
to do this and--
(stops thinks)
remember Gazerbeam He had trouble
adjusting to civilian life too

BOB
Yeah there was something about him in
the paper When was the last time you saw
him

FROZONE
I don’t see anyone from the old days
Bob Just you We’re pushing our luck as
it is It was fun the first time but we
keep doin’ this and--

The scanner SQUAWKS suddenly-

SCANNER
We have a report of a fire at Fourth and
Elias

BOB

A fire Were close Yeah baby

Bob pulls a ski mask over his face Shaking his head at
his own complicity Lucius does likewise

FROZONE
-we‘re gonna get caught

He starts the car and U-turns toward the fire
CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Bob’s enthusiastic SHOUTS echo off the darkened buildings

as the sedan peels off followed a beat later by the
MYSTERIOUS BLONDE in the black sports car

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

A raging inferno Bob descends the burning steps stops
in the hallway Both he and Frozone carry several passed-
out apartment dwellers on their shoulders

LUCIUS
Is that everybody

BOB
Yeah that’s everyone

The building is beginning to COLLAPSE They’re trapped
with no way out Frozone tries to ice the burning walls
but his ray is weak and ineffective

BOB (CONT’‘D)
Can‘t you put this out

Lucius
I cant lay down a layer thick enough
It’s evaporating too fast

BOB
What What’s that mean

LUCIUS
Means it’s hot and I’m dehydrated Bob

BOB
Youre out of ICE You can’t run out of
ice I thought you could use the water in
the air

LUCIUS
There IS NO water in this air What’s
your excuse Run out of muscles

BOB
I can’t just go smashing through walls
The buildings getting weaker by the
second It’ll come down on top of us

LUCIUS
I wanted to go bowling

A large chunk of ceiling smashes to the floor in a
burning heap Bob looks around nervously then fixes his
gaze toward the door He shifts his stack of unconscious
victims to one shoulder and looks at Lucius

BOB
Alright Stay right on my tail this is
going to get hot

Bob begins a shout that gets louder as he runs into the
burning hallway Lucius a half-step behind him

TRAVELING WITH BOB and LUCIUS

as they race through the flames with their unconscious
loads Suddenly a BRICK WALL APPEARS Bob picks up speed
and lowers his free shoulder into it

The heroes and their rescued smash through the wall just
as the building behind them collapses Bob Frozone and
the pile of near-victims are saved An ALARM sounds Bob
and Frozone realize they’ re--

INSIDE A JEWELRY STORE

A ROOKIE COP spies the MASKED MEN and draws his pistol
Frozone spies a WATER COOLER He grabs a PAPER CUP

ROOKIE COP
FREEZE

LUCIUS
I’m thirsty

Lucius moves the cup under the tap The jittery ROOKIE
cocks his pistol’s hammer

ROOKIE COP
I said PREEZE

LUCIUS
I’m just getting a drink

His eyes fixed on the cop Lucius slooowwwly brings the
cup to his lips and drinks His face becomes serene

ROOKIE COP
Alright You’ve had your drink Now I
want you to--

LUCIUS
I know I know

Lucius drops the cup raising his hands in front of him

LUCIUS (CONT’D)
«»freeze”

( )

A frigid blast splits the air
ON THE STREET OUTSIDE

2 fire trucks and a police car screech having arrived in
front Hearing the alarm two VETERAN COPS bust into the--

INSIDE JEWELRY STORE - CONTINUOUS

Drawing their guns the COPS are stopped by a bewildering
sight

“ma recovering heap of rescued fire victims at the base
of an enormous hole in the wall Standing watch over them
is the ROOKIE stunned and blinking under a layer of ice

A BACK ALLEYWAY SAME TIME

Bob and Lucius jump into Lucius’s car pulling off their
ski masks

FROZONE
That was way too close We are not doing
that again

They drive out of frame REVEALING a BLACK SPORTS CAR
hidden in another alley behind At the wheel is a
beautiful mysterious WOMAN with platinum blonde hair
She watches them drive off

RADIO
Verify you want to switch targets Over

WOMAN
Trust me This is the one he’s been
looking for

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bob enters quietly through the kitchen pausing in the
kitchen long enough to nab the remaining hunk of
chocolate cake Humming pleasantly as he chews he moves
into the living room when a voice comes out of the dark--

HELENS VOICE
You said you’d be back by eleven

Bob FREEZES A light snaps ON A chair swivels around--
it’s Helen wearing her robe and a peeved expression

BOB
I said Id be back later

HELEN
I assumed you’d be back later If you
came back at all you’d be “back later”

BOB
Well I’m back Okay

Bob moves to go but Helen’s left arm STRETCHES and stops
him plucking a small dusty fragment of concrete off his
coat She crosses to him catching up with her hand

HELEN

Is this rubble
BOB

(defensive)

It was just a little workout just to
stay loose--

HELEN
You know how I feel about that Bob Darn
you We just got settled We cant blow
cover again

BOB
-the building was coming down anyway--

HELEN
Wha-- You KNOCKED DOWN A BUILDING

BOB
It was on fire Structurally unsound It
was coming down anyway

HELEN
Tell me it’s not the police scanner again-

BOB
I performed a public service You act
like that’s a bad thing

HELEN
It is a bad thing Bob Uprooting our
family again because you had to relive
the glory days is a very bad thing

BOB
Hey reliving the glory days is better
than acting like they didn’t happen

HELEN
Yes They happened But this our family
is what’s happening now Bob

(MORE ) ( )
34

HELEN (CONTD)
And you are missing this I can’t believe
you don’t want to go to your own sons
graduation

BOB
Its not a graduation He’s moving from
the fourth grade to the fifth grade

HELEN
It’s a ceremony

BOB
It’s psychotic They keep creating new
ways to celebrate mediocrity but if
someone is genuinely exceptional they
shut him down because they don’t want
everybody else to feel bad

HELEN
This is not about you Bob This is
about Dash

BOB

You wanna help Dash Let him actually
compete Let him go out for sports

HELEN
I will not be made the enemy here You
know why we can’t do that

BOB
BECAUSE HE’D BE GREAT

HELEN
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU

An abrupt BREEZE ripples the air ruffling some loose
papers on the coffee table

BOB
Alright Dash I know you’re listening
Come on out

HELEN
You too young lady

Dash moves out from behind a door Violet’s head
REMATERIALIZES from behind the couch she stands up
embarrassed Bob moves next to Helen becoming parental

BOB
It’s okay kids We’re just having a
discussion

(

VIOLET
Pretty loud discussion

BOB
But that’s okay Whats important is that
Mommy and I are always a team always
united against uh
(unsure where he’s going)
---the forces of--

HELEN
Pigheadedness

BOB
I was going to say evil or something

HELEN
(to kids)
Were sorry we woke you Everythings
okay Go back to bed it’s late In fact--
(pointedly to Bob)
-we should all be in bed

Bob frowns and turns away following the kids back toward
the bedrooms

INSURICARE - BOBS CUBICLE - FOLLOWING MORNING
Bob sits at his tiny desk One look at his bleary face

says it all he hasn’t slept all night His intercom
BEEPS Bob glares at it a beat then hits ANSWER

INTERCOM

Mr Huph wants you in his office
BOB

Now
INTERCOM

Now

Bob releases the intercom button SIGHS Mirage looks
around Bob’s cramped cubicle her gaze falling to the
open briefcase on Bob’s desk

INSIDE HUPH’S OFFICE
Marginally bigger than Bob’s office with a coveted
window to the outside world Painfully clean and joyless

Every pencil sharpened every paper perfectly stacked and
aligned to run parallel to the edge of the desktop

HUPH
Sit down Bob
(Bob sits)
I’m not happy Bob Not Happy Ask me
why

Huph rises from his desk and crosses to Bob

BOB
Okay Why

HUPH
Why what Be specific Bob

Bobs eyes are drawn to the window Outside across the
street a stocky man lingers suspiciously in an alleyway

BOB
(still watching man)
Why are you unhappy

HUPH
Your customers make me unhappy

BOB
(turns back to Huph)
You’ve gotten complaints

HUPH

Complaints I can handle What I can’t
handle is your customers’ inexplicable
knowledge of Insuricare’s inner workings
They’re experts Experts Bob Exploiting
every loophole dodging every obstacle-

(aghast)
--they’re penetrating the bureaucracy

BOB
Did I do something illegal

HUPH

(irked)

No

BOB
Are you saying we shouldn’t help our
customers

HUPH

The law requires that I answer no

BOB
Were supposed to help people

HUPH
Were supposed to help OUR people
Starting with our stockholders Bob
Whos helping them out huh

Huph draws a calming breath affects a statesmanlike air

HUPH (CONTD)
You know Bob a company is

BOB
Like an enormous clock

HUPH
like an enormous cl-- Yes Precisely
It only works if all the little cogs mesh
together

Bob’s attention returns to the window the stocky man is
accosting a smaller one Like an ATTACK DOG Bob is
suddenly ALERT every muscle tensed and ready-

HUPH (0S) (CONT’D)
Now a clock needs to be clean well-
lubricated wound tight The best clocks
have jewel movements cogs that fit that
cooperate by design I’m being
metaphorical Bob You know what I mean
by cooperative cogs Bob Bob

Huph follows Bobs gaze to the window On the street the
larger man clubs the smaller man with a mace He crumples
to the sidewalk Huph jerks Bob’s face back toward his-

HUPH (CONTD)
Look at me when I’m talking to you Parr

BOB
(pointing)
That man out there-- he needs help

HUPH
Do NOT change the subject Bob We’re
discussing your attitude

BOB
But he’s getting mugged

HUPH
Well let’s hope we don’t cover him

( )

BOB
(heading for the door)
Ill be right back

HUPH
Stop RIGHT NOW OR YOU’RE FIRED

Bob HESITATES his hand on the knob of the opened door
fighting back the very core of his being Huph narrows
his eyes speaking softly

HUPH (CONTD)
Close the door

Neck cords STRAINING Bob slowly shuts the door He
releases the knob which hes crumpled in rage

HUPH (CONTD)
Get over here now

Bob resumes his position in front of Huph but his gaze
inevitably returns to the scene outside the window

BOBS P0V

The MUGGER pockets his plunder and runs off leaving his
victim dazed and helpless on the sidewalk

BOB
(seething)
He got away

RUPH
Good thing too You were this close to
losing your j-

Huph SQUEAKS as Bob’s enormous right hand flashes out and
clamps around his neck--

OUTER HALLWAY

Huph’s body BURSTS THROUGH A WALL and into another
adjacent tumbling face down onto a copy machine It
begins to spit out multiple copies of his pressed face

Huph has in fact gone through several walls four in
total and three adjoining offices before skidding across
the floor of the newly visible hallway beyond

The occupants of adjacent offices lean into view gawking

in astonishment through their shattered walls first at
Huph’s sprawled form then one by one back at Bob

BOB
Uh oh

HOSPITAL - HALLWAY HOURS LATER

Through the window in the door we can glimpse Huph in a
full body cast Bob seated on a bench outside looks up
as RICK DICKER a haggard-faced man in a black suit and
tie quietly exits Huph’s room He stops looks at Bob
then turns away heading to the elevator Bob follows
after him

BOB
How is he

DICKER
He’1l live

BOB
I’m fired aren’t I

DICKER
You think

BOB

What can I say Rick

DICKER
Nothing you haven’t said before

BOB
Someone was in trouble

DICKER
Someone‘s always in trouble

BOB
I had to do something

DICKER
Yeah Every time you say those words it
means a month and a half of trouble for
me Bob Minimum It means hundreds of
thousands of taxpayer dollars

BOB
I know

DICKER
We gotta pay to keep the company quiet
We gotta pay damages erase memories
relocate your family Every time it gets
harder Money money money

(MORE)

DICKER (CONTD)
We cant keep doing this Bob We
appreciate what you did in the old days
but those days are over From now on
you’re on your own

The elevator doors OPEN Dicker steps inside Bob stares
at the floor beaten Dicker looks at him with pity Then-

DICKER (CONTD)
Listen Bob maybe I could relocate
you for old times’ sake

BOB
No I can’t do that to my family again
We just got settled It’ll be alright
I’1l make it work Thanks

Dicker stares at Bob a long moment A bittersweet smile--

DICKER
Take care of yourself

The elevator doors CLOSE Bob stares at them numb
EXT BOB’S DRIVEWAY -— DUSK

Bob climbs out of his car and is surprised to find
someone watching him--

-the KID on the Big Wheel waiting in exactly the same
spot as the night before

BOB
Whatre you waiting for

RID
I dunno Something amazing I guess

A rueful smile blooms and dies on Bob’s face

BOB
Me too kid Me too

INT BOB‘S DEN

A cramped windowless museum of MR INCREDIBLE arcana
Walls and shelves cluttered with mementos of his storied
past framed photos newspaper front pages magazines
and displayed on the wall under Plexiglas his MR
INCREDIBLE SUIT

Bob enters and closes the door He opens his briefcase
pulls out an INSURICARE EMPLOYEES MANUAL Bob growls and
rips it in half tossing it in the trashcan

(

On a roll now he begins to dump the entire contents of
his briefcase into the trash when-- CLUNK

Bob DOUBLE-TAKES startled by the HEAVY sound He peers
over the edge of the desk into the trash and SEES--

A LARGE MANILA ENVELOPE He picks it up and is surprised
its heavy He opens it and pulls out a FLAT PANEL about
a half-inch thick On it is printed “THIS END UP”

He turns the panel as instructed In the center is a
small circle with writing beneath it Bob SQUINTS unable
to read the tiny letters He brings it closer--

HIS POV

As the letters slowly come into focus
BOB
(reading)
HOLD STILL

Suddenly the panel projects a red GRID over Bob’s face
We hear a robotic female VOICE-

VOICE
Match Mr Incredible

Bob DROPS the panel in surprise It clatters to the desk
still functioning A small foot-long rod with a metal
ball at the top pops out from the panel The ball at the
tip makes a quick single revolution scanning the
surrounding room with a vertical beam

VOICE (CONTD)
Room is secure Commence message

The panel FLICKERS It’s a VIDEO SCREEN An IMAGE
appears the beautiful platinum blonde woman who visited
Bobs office earlier that day

WOMAN
Hello Mr Incredible My name is Mirage
Yes we know who you are Rest assured
your secret is safe with us Actually we
have something in common According to
the Government neither of us exist
Please pay attention as this message is
CLASSIFIED and will not be repeated

Bob moves closer mesmerized

MIRAGE
I represent a top-secret division of the
Government designing and testing
experimental technology and-- we have
need of your unique abilities

HELENS VOICE
Honey

Bob startles then strains to listen to the message

MIRAGE (CONT’D) BOB
Something has happened at What
our remote testing
facility

MIRAGE (CONTD) HELENS VOICE
A highly experimental Dinner’s ready

prototype robot has escaped
our control--

MIRAGE (CONTD) BOB
Although it is contained OKAY okay
within an isolated area--

Bob grabs a pen and a scrap of paper and starts to
scribble furiously only to find the pen dry Cursing he
rummages for a working pen finds one and begins to take
notes

MIRAGE
-it threatens to cause incalculable
damage to itself and to our facilities
jeopardizing hundreds of millions of
dollars’ worth of equipment and research
Only someone with--

HELENS VOICE MIRAGE (CONTD)
Is someone in there -your unique abilities can
contain the robot without
completely destroying it

BOB MIRAGE (CONTD)
The TV Im trying to Because of its highly
watch-- sensitive nature--
HELEN’S VOICE MIRAGE (CONTD)
Well stop trying it’s «this mission does not
time for dinner nor will it ever exist

(

BOB MIRAGE (CONT’D)
ONE MINUTE If you accept your payment
will be equivalent to your

current annual salary

Bob’s jaw goes slack He scribbles “BIG ”
MIRAGE (CONTD)

Call the number on the screen Voice
matching will be used to insure security
The Supers arent gone Mr Incredible
Youre still here You can still do qreat
things Or you can listen to Police
Scanners Your choice You have 24 hours
to respond Think about it

Bob finishes scribbling His mind is reeling HEROIC

MUSIC begins to stir A new light comes into Bob’s eyes

as they turn to the--

PICTURES ON THE WALL

of Mr Incredible’s gallant past The robotic voice
relays a last message-

VOICE
This message will self-destruct

Bob’s eyes fall to the panel Uh oh

HALLWAY OUTSIDE BOB’S DEN

We hear a muffled BOOM from inside After a long beat the
ceiling sprinklers come on followed by the family’s
SHOUTS from the dining room

The den door opens and Bob emerges in a cloud of smoke
SO preoccupied that hes slow to notice the downpour

INSIDE - LATER
Bob and Helen finish drying the inside of the house

HELEN
Youre one distracted guy

BOB
Amn Am I Don’t mean to be

Helen looks at Bob puts a tender arm around hin

( )

HELEN
I know you miss being a hero and your
job is frustrating and and I just want

you to know how much it means to me that
you stay at it anyway

BOB

Honey about the job
HELEN

What
BOB

I-I uh somethings happened-
Helen glares at him clearly expecting the worst

HELEN
Whaaat

BOB
The company’s sending me to a conference
out of town I’1l be gone for a few days

HELEN
A conference They‘ve never sent you to a
conference before

Helen gives Bob a questioning look Bob tenses Pause

HELEN (CONTD)
This is good isn’t it

BOB
Yes

HELEN
You see Theyre finally recognizing your
talents You’re moving up
(she hugs him then softly)
Its wonderful

BOB
Yes Yes it is

BOBS DEN - LATER

Bob is on the phone glancing at the MR INCREDIBLE SUIT
in his display case After a ring a female voice answers-

BOB (CONTD)
This is Mr Incredible I’m in

ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY
A sleek-looking MANTA JET slices the sky
INSIDE THE JET

Bob clad in his old (and now too-tight) Mr Incredible
suit MIRAGE IS ON BOARD SHE DEBRIEFS HIM

MIRAGE
The OMNIDROID 9000 is a top-secret
prototype battle robot Its artificial
intelligence enables it to solve any
problem it’s confronted with And
unfortunately--

MR INCREDIBLE
Let me guess It got smart enough to
wonder why it had to take orders

MIRAGE
(nodding)
--we lost control And now it’s loose in
the jungle threatening our facility
We’ve had to evacuate all personnel from
the island for their own safety They’re
waiting offshore for the all clear

MR INCREDIBLE
How am I going in

MIRAGE
The Omnidroid’s defenses have
necessitated an air drop from 5000 feet
Its cloaking device makes it difficult to
track although were pretty sure it’s
on the southern half of the island One
more thing obviously it represents a
significant investment-—-

MR INCREDIBLE
You want me to shut it down without
completely destroying it

MIRAGE
(smiles)
You are Mr Incredible

DROP POD BAY

After a few unsuccessful tries Mr Incredible manages to
squeeze his girth into the pod Mirage enters the pod
bay presses the pod’s speaker switch

MIRAGE
(through speaker)
Remember it’s a learning robot Every
moment you spend fighting it only
increases its knowledge of how to beat
you

BOB
(through speaker)
Shut it down Do it quickly Don’t
destroy it

MIRAGE
(through speaker)
And dont die

Bob shoots Mirage a wan smile

BOB
Great Thanks

The POD is blasted from the jet and disappears into
clouds above the island

SLOW DISSOLVE To
EXT NOMANISAN JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER

Bob groans as he tries to disengage his generous belly
from the tiny pod Finally with a frustrated yell he
RIPS the pod in half FREE He stretches does a few toe
touches and twists to shake out the kinks He’s ready

BOB
Showtime

He jogs off into the jungle to track the robot
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES

As an out-of-shape Bob jogs deeper and deeper into the
jungle growing more winded with each passing mile His
sides ache and he PAUSES now and then to catch his
breath but he shakes it off and resumes his pursuit

DISSOLVE TO
LATER

The forest is still now and Bob’s footfalls and heavy
breathing are the only sounds we hear Bob still scans
the jungle but he’s tiring and he pauses to lean against
a banyan tree to catch his breath

(

and notices LARGE SLASH MARKS in the side of the tree
He runs his hand over them they’re fresh In the dirt
near his feet is a giant X-SHAPED FOOTPRINT

BOB
Amn

With a loud CRACK the trees behind him split apart and
the OMNIDROID is upon him It SLASHES at him and he
dodges but not quickly enough and the bot’s claw catches
him in the shoulder drawing blood

Fire comes into Bob’s eyes and when the bot slashes again
he’s ready- leaping over the bot and landing on his feet
on the opposite side The bot is caught by surprise and
in the split second it takes for the bot to find Bob--

--BAMMMM Bob has thrown a mammoth punch that sends the
machine flying into the nearest tree

Bob lets out a happy snarl that says “You just got
schooled by MR INCREDIBLE baby” Deep within its metal
shell servos WHINE and the bot rights itself its EYE
LENS fixing on Bob

BOB (CONTD)
Uh oh

The bot CHARGES Once again Bob tries his patented leap--

TIME SLOWS as we cut to INSIDE THE BOT’S BRAIN A
VIEWSCREEN shows the arc of Bob’s leap being calculated
by the bot

RESUME WIDE SHOT

The bot swings- SWATTING Bob mid-jump Bob sails into a
banyan tree so hard that it splits the trunk Bob is
STUNNED the bot has quickly learned and countered The
bot CHARGES again

WITH BOB

-as he runs for his life the Omnidroid hot on his tail
Bob races through the jungle with surprising speed but
his added weight is slowing him down He CUTS hard to his
right and DIVES--

OFF A CLIFF

Bob tumbles and slides down the rocky near-vertical
face followed by the relentless machine It ROLLS past
him and lands in his path

48

Bob flings boulders at the machine but the bot is a fast
learner immediately incorporating Bobs moves into its
own attack

The Omnidroid leaps high in the air and nearly lands on
top of Bob who leaps clear and tumbles to the bottom of
the cliffs

LAVA FIELDS

Bob REELS and before he knows what’s happening the
Omnidroid is there driving him toward the bubbling-hot
pools of LAVA

Bob resists the bot with all his might but his feet
cant hold the rocky surface and as he is pushed ever
closer to the white-hot lava fear begins to grip his
mind

Bob and the Omnidroid grip each other like wildly
mismatched wrestlers with Bob at lava‘s edge now losing
ground Bob is STRAINING desperate then something in
him SNAPS He fills with rage and with a ROAR he—-

--jerks to one side and FLIPS the OMNIDROID into the
lava The machine hits the lava with a hissy SPLAT sinks
into the hot glow and disappears Bob is wild He laughs
pointing at the bot’s grave with a gesture of defiance
and--

SNAPi-- throws his back out Suddenly he can’t breathe

BOB
Agh My back-

The ground EXPLODES beneath him splitting the rock
Claws rise from the lava grip the rock and the dreaded
Omnidroid draws itself out of the lava dripping magma
its metal body glowing red as if it came from hell
itself

Bob looks down The ground is splitting into chunks
beneath his feet In pain barely able to move Bob makes
a desperate leap to a chunk of rock as it breaks free
and lands pathetically on top

The bot snatches him off and slams him into the ground
Then it lifts Bob up grabbing his feet with another claw
and begins to pull Bob apart Bob strains then-- POP

--his back realigns Bob is a new man With a laugh he
jackknifes-- ripping off one of the Omnidroid’s claws He
drops underneath the bot causing the bot to open a
second eye in its underbelly to find him

( )

Bob ROARS seizing the second eye ripping it off the
bot’s body and flinging it in the lava pool Before the
bot can react Bob has climbed inside the hole in the
belly The bot knows Bob is inside and begins to STAB
itself wildly to get at him puncturing itself again
and again and tearing itself apart

Until sparking and sputtering it staggers and shuts
down Bob punches a hole in the top whistling and
slapping its side The bot drunkenly ROUSES and makes a
final grab for Bob deep within its belly and rips out
its own metallic guts

»-and KEELS OVER a lifeless scrap pile Bob hops out
smiling Mr Incredible’s work is done

IN A NEARBY TREE

An exotic BIRD which looks strangely out of place cocks
its head to one side CAMERA PUSHES IN to one of its eyes
as a metal IRIS appears It’s a CAMERA LENS

stands with Mirage watching this all on a bank of VIDEO
SCREENS

SHADOWED FIGURE
Surprising We must bring him back Sound
the all clear
(he exits stops turns back)
And invite him to dinner

INT DINING HALL - OUTER CORRIDOR EARLY EVENING
A TRANSPOD arrives and Bob steps out dressed in a tux
INT DINING HALL

Bob opens the door peeks inside The hall is massive
with an open terrace that overlooks the tropical forest
In the center of the room is an enormous dining table
placed parallel to a fall of hot LAVA

Bob checks his watch realizes he’s early A sudden
RUMBLE makes him look up The LAVA FALL PARTS revealing
a SECRET PASSAGEWAY MIRAGE emerges

Bob instinctively pulls back leaving the door opened
just enough to watch A SILHOUETTED FIGURE follows after
Mirage gesturing animatedly They pause at the entrance
to the passageway their talk too distant to be heard

A sound causes MIRAGE to look in Bob’s direction
INT DINING HALL - OUTER CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Mirage suspicious pushes open the dining hall DOORS
Climbing out of the transpod Bob notices her and smiles

BOB
Am I overdressed

MIRAGE
Actually you look rather dashing

INT DINING HALL

Bob and Mirage are seated at an enormous table that runs
parallel to an equally large LAVA FALL

BOB
I take it our host is--

MIRAGE
Im sorry He’s not able to dine with us
tonight He hopes youll understand

BOB
Of course I usually make it a point to
know who I’m working for

MIRAGE
He prefers a certain amount of anonymity
Surely you of all people understand that

BOB
I was just wondering of all the places
to settle down why live--

MIRAGE
--with a volcano He’s attracted to
power So am I It’s a weakness we share

BOB
Seems a bit unstable

MIRAGE
I prefer to think of it as misunderstood

BOB
Arent we all

MIRAGE
Volcanic soil is among the most fertile
on earth Everything at the table was
grown right here How does it compare

BOB
Everythings delicious

Bob raises his glass Mirage smiles and does likewise
MONTAGE INCREDIBLE AGAIN

His self-esteem back Bob returns home with renewed
vigor He bonds with his kids gets frisky with Helen
and takes new pride in his appearance He buys a new
snazzy SPORTS CAR for himself and a new car for Helen
After he says goodbye to Helen several mornings clearly
pretending to go off to the job he no longer holds at
Insuricare we see how he’s actually spending his days
dropping weight and getting in shape

The Superheroic workouts do their job Bob is in the best
shape he’s been in many years

INT BOB’S BEDROOM - MORNING -— MONTHS LATER

Bob dressed in a more expensive and tailored version of

snaps it shut

EXT E’S HOUSE — DAY

Bobs new car pulls up to an imposing gate a futuristic
web of parallel laser beams He turns toward a video
screen and presses a button beneath it The VIDEO SCREEN
lights up revealing a BURLY GUARD

GUARD
Do you have an appointment

BOB
I’m an old friend I just wanted

GUARD
All visitors are required to make arr-

The GUARD suddenly flinches from something below camera
and is shooed offscreen by a strident husky female voice-

VOICE
Get back Rolf Go check the electric
fence or something

A pair of huge glasses fronting the top half of a head
rises into the bottom half of the screen out of focus
This is EDNA MODE known by her friends simply as “E”

E
What is it What do you want

Bob removes his sunglasses and grins at the camera

E (CONT’D)
My God youve gotten fat Come in Come

The gate opens and Bob drives up the long driveway that
winds up the hill to E‘s tastefully arty house

INT E’S HOUSE

BOB
A new suit Where the hell would I get--

INT PARR HOME - MASTER BEDROOM — EVENING
Helen plucks one of Bob’s enormous shirts from a stack of
freshly cleaned laundry and hangs it up in their closet
when something catches her eye
A long PLATINUM-BLONDE HAIR (Mirage’s) on Bob’s suit
jacket Helen plucks it off examining it The phone
RINGS She goes to answer it hesitating when she hears--

INT PARR GARAGE MORNING

Bob is seated in his new sports car its engine purring
He belts himself in Helen enters still in her robe

A storm of conflicting emotions play across Helens face
But she puts on a happy face and leans down through his
open window

HELEN

Have a nice trip
BOB

Thanks honey Call you when I land
HELEN

I love you so much

Something in her voice makes Bob hesitate He looks back
at her curious

BOB

He gives her a kiss then backs out of the driveway and
with a wave drives off

EXT ABOVE THE CLOUDS DAY

The sleek-looking MANTA JET slices the sky

prawn into some cocktail sauce and gazes around the
luxurious cabin He’s happy as a clam

His glass disappears into his armrest instantly replaced
by a full glass of mimosa

belts We’re beginning our descent

OVER THE ISLAND

As the jet begins its descent toward the island we begin
to see its spectacular aspects active volcano towering
snow-capped peak tumbling waterfalls futuristic
monorail etc a paradise on earth

Suddenly the engines cut off and the jet PLUNGES nose
down into the sea converting into a SUBMERSIBLE

BENEATH THE WATER’S SURFACE

The jetsub cruises through a fantastic seascape of exotic
otherworldly rock formations toward the base of the
island through vast curtains of bubbles created from a
field of cooling lava

A massive door OPENS revealing a huge underwater docking
bay The ship enters the entrance closing behind them

INSIDE THE DOCKING BAY

The water DRAINS The JETSUB settles to a landing A
giant DOCKING TUBE extends from a side wall and connects
to the side of the jetsub

Bob enters the monopod The doors shut and it takes off
EXT NOMANISAN JUNGLE TRAVELING WITH THE POD

The MONOPOD zooms along a track which rises from a tunnel
beneath the lagoon and sweeps through the jungle
Although this is his second time here Bob is seeing the
island with new eyes It is a WONDER

The monopod track disappears straight into a rushing
WATERFALL Suddenly the waterfall PARTS the water
separating like an enormously long chiffon curtain
revealing the intricately designed architecture hidden
underneath

WITH THE POD

as it enters a VERTICAL TUBE and ZOOMS upward into the
dark

INT NOMANISAN BASE - CONFERENCE ROOM A113

Bob opens the door No one is there He checks the wall
clock two o’clock He decides to enter and takes a seat
at the meeting table There are some strange low sounds

Then the far wall SLIDES OPEN revealing the outdoors and-
--a bigger badder OMNIDROID

Bob turns to run but the OMNIDROID is fast It grabs him
and flings him into the outside air

EXT BASE - JUNGLE CLEARING CONTINUOUS

Bob SAILS to the edge of the jungle landing with a thud
Before he can react the robot has him again and slams
him into the ground A VOICE comes over a loudspeaker

VOICE
It’s BIGGER It’s BADDER

The robot seizes Bob in one giant claw turning two
others into WHIRLING BLADES They close in on Bob’s neck-

--when a young chunky wild-haired man in a bright
Supersuit descends from the sky on jet-boots landing on
top of the enormous robot

WILD-HAIRED MAN
Its too much for Mr Incredible It’s
finally ready

The wild-haired man pokes a few buttons on one of his
wristbands The robot’s BLADES stop the bot stands down

WILD-HAIRED MAN (CONT’D)
T went through quite a few Supers to get
it worthy to fight you but man it
wasn’t good enough After you trashed the
last one I had to make some major
modifications Sure it was difficult but
you are worth it After all I’m your
biggest fan

A dark realization falls over Bob’s face

BOB
Buddy

BUDDY
My names not BUDDY

He presses a button on one of the thick platinum BANDS
around his wrists the OMNIDROID FLINGS Bob again

BUDDY (CONTD)
And it’s not “IncrediBoy” either That

you I only wanted to help And what did
you say to me

Still in his IncrediBoy costume but without the mask
Buddy glowers up at his bedroom wall a shrine to Mr

countries who want respect And they will
pay through the nose to get it How do

Now I have a weapon that only I can
defeat and when I unleash it I’1ll get-—-

Bob suddenly FLINGS the LOG at Buddy He DUCKS it and
presses a button on one of his WRISTBANDS a BEAM erupts
from his index finger and HITS Bob in his chest FREEZING
him mid-action Buddy CHUCKLES with admiration

BUDDY (CONTD)
You sly dog You got me monologuing

Buddy jerks his beam-arm to his right effortlessly
hurling Bob into a tree with tremendous force

BUDDY (CONTD)
Cool huh Zero-point energy I save the
best inventions for myself

Buddy immediately catches Bob in the IMMOBIRAY again
freezing him in space

I’m SYNDROME Your nemesis And

Syndrome realizes he’s lost Bob inadvertently flinging
him over the trees

SYNDROME
Brilliant

JUNGLE CLIFFS

Bobs body arcs over the treetops dropping into a deep

river that flows into a waterfall He pulls himself onto
a rock Syndrome becomes visible over the distant trees
He spies Bob and rockets toward him

Bob takes a running leap off the rock over the falls
and disappears into the mists below

UNDERWATER AT THE BASE OF THE FALLS

Bob hits the water in an explosion of bubbles

AT THE TOP OF THE FALLS

Syndrome lands on the rock Pulls a tiny electronic
DEVICE from his wristband He hits the primer The device
begins to BEEP

SYNDROME
Try one of these on for size big boy

He drops the device over the falls
UNDERWATER THE BASE OF THE FALLS

Bobs eyes widen when he sees the device entering the
water He turns and swims as fast as he can for the
nearest protection a hole in the rocks The device
EXPLODES——

-blowing BOB through the hole so fast that--
INT CAVE

He is BLOWN into the inside of a cave Bob COUGHS up some
water tries to catch his breath He looks up to see-

--a skeletal FACE He jumps back in surprise It is the
remains of a MAN his only clothes the ragged remnants of
shoulder pads boots and an odd-looking HELMET

Bob crawls over to rub some dirt from the emblem over the
eyes the emblem reads “G B”

BOB
Gazerbeam

The skeleton is still sitting up and Bob is compelled to
follow its gaze to the adjacent cave wall There
presumably in his dying moments Gazerbeam had burned a
word into the rock “KRONOS”

BOB (CONTD)
Kronos

Just then Bob hears a sound near the blowhole of the
cave A tiny flying PROBE rises from the hole A scanner
detects a body in the cave and the probe flies toward
it It pauses in front of the skeleton scans it then
retreats exiting

Bob slowly rises from behind the skeletal remains and
watches it go

JUNGLE - TOP OF THE FALLS
Syndrome’s PROBE emerges from the mist of the falls and

returns to Syndrome It BEEPS as it DOCKS with his
wristband

INSIDE E‘S HOUSE - DAY
E leads Helen downstairs toward her hidden lab

E
This project has completely confiscated
my life darling consumed me as only
hero work can My best work I must
admit Simple Elegant yet bold You
will die I did Robert’s suit and it
turned out so beautiful I just had to
continue

HELEN
E it’s great to see you but- I have no
idea what you’re talking about I just-

E
Yes words are useless Gobble gobble
gobble-- theres too much of it darling
too much That is why I show you my work
That is why you are here

She turns to the wall and rapidly executes an elaborate
series of security measures

punches a fifteen-digit code with her left hand while-

pressing her right hand against a panel It FLASHES as-
she exposes her eyes to a RETINAL SCAN which-

causes a MICROPHONE to extend from the wall to her lips--

E (CONT’D)
(into microphone)
Edna Mode

IN A FLASH a CEILING PANEL OPENS and out pops an
ENORMOUS GUN which trains its sights on Helen E sees
this turns back to the microphone adding hastily-

E (CONT‘D)
And “guest”

The gun retreats into the ceiling The wall in front of
them OPENS dramatically REVEALING

ES TESTING LAB

A large ultra-sophisticated work area dedicated to the
design fabrication and testing of SUPERHERO SUITS

E crosses to a large raised PLATFORM mounted to a track
running parallel to a glassed-in chamber and sits in one
of the two chairs facing it Between the chairs is a
small table with a fresh pot of coffee and assorted
cookies E motions Helen to join her--

E
Come sit Cream and sugar

Helen shakes her head feeling a little bewildered and
sits as E pours and hands her a cup of coffee

E (CONTD)
I started with the baby

HELEN
“Started”

E

Shh darling shh--

Inside the chamber a panel opens A small featureless
BABY MANNEQUIN in a tiny red SUIT (sporting the same “i”
insignia as Bob’s) mounted to a post emerges tracking
slowly from one end of the chamber to the other

E (CONT’D)
-I cut it a little roomy for the free
movement the fabric is comfortable for
sensitive skin--

The inside of the chamber ERUPTS in FLAMES Helen jumps
back as E continues talking--

E (CONT’D)
-and can also withstand a temperature of
over one thousand degrees--

The flames are suddenly replaced by a barrage of MACHINE
GUN FIRE as the suit is blasted by hundreds of bullets--

E (CONT’D)
--completely bulletproof--

The GUNFIRE stops

(

E (CONT’D)
-and machine-washable darling that’s a
new feature

HELEN
What in heaven’s name do you think the
baby will be doing

E
Well I’m sure I don’t know darling
Luck favors the prepared I didn’t know
the babys powers so I covered the basics-

HELEN
Jack-Jack doesn’t have any powers

E
No Well he’1l look fabulous anyway

As the Baby suit exits one end the panel REOPENS on the
other side Another MANNEQUIN Dashs size swings into the
smoky chamber its arms and legs slowly churning in a
“running” motion which gradually accelerates into a BLUR

E (CONT‘D)
Your boy’s suit I designed to withstand
enormous friction without heating up or
wearing out a useful feature

The Dash suit departs into the wall as a new suit enters

E (CONT’D)
Your daughter’s suit was tricky but I
finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does

Helen’s suit moves into view ROBOT ARMS enter from above
and below CLAMP to the sleeves of arms and pants and
begin to PULL them wide apart in various contortions--

E (CONTD)
Your suit can stretch as far as you can
without injuring yourself and still
retain its shape

Two small BOMBS appear on either side of the suit and
EXPLODE bending the

EZ (CONTD)
Virtually indestructible yet it breathes
like Egyptian cotton

(MORE)

( )

E (CONTD)
As an extra feature each suit contains a
Homing Device giving you the precise
global location of the wearer at the
touch of a button

The chamber goes dark the lights return to their less-
dramatic setting E swivels to face Helen a cocky smile
playing at the corners of her mouth

E (CONTD)
Well darling What do you think

HELEN
What do I think Bob is retired I’m
retired Our family is underground You
helped my husband resume secret hero work
behind my back

E
I assumed you knew darling Why would he
keep secrets from you

HELEN
(defensive)
He wouldnt He didn’t-- doesn’t

There is a heavy PAUSE E considers her
E

Men at Robert’s age are often unstable
Prone to weakness

Do you know where he is
HELEN
Of course
E

Do you KNOW where he is

track which curves around the coastline Bob crouches
and DIVES

hit a PALM TREE

The palm BENDS slowing Bob‘s drop before he expertly
releases it and drops inte another palm directly below
it

Bob leaps onto the reof of the pod quickly dispatching
the guards inside tossing them into the ocean Bob seats
himself at the controls as the pod races toward
Syndrome’s base and a security checkpoint

Two GUARDS look up as they hear the monopod approach A
sparking WHEEL CARRIAGE arrives at the gate its cab
completely torn off and missing

Suddenly alert the GUARDS cock their guns and aim into

Bob pulls up behind some trees There are several GUARDS
two at the vehicle entrance another at the balcony
above Bob thinks a bit looks down and finds a COCONUT

With expert precision he throws it at the balcony guard
BEANING HIM He falls off the balcony and hits the
ground

The other guards rush to help him leaving their post
Bob runs up to the vehicle entrance-- it’s locked tight
Bob sees shadows of guards approaching he’s out in the
open and about to be caught when--

it An AMBULANCE moves out of the open bay and as the
door moves closed behind it we see Bob drop into the

it Picks up large stone sculpture Readies to run into

set the massive sculpture back into place before Mirage

enters Bob rushes into the closing passage Jumps clear
just as passage CLOSES

A series of parallel floor lights click on Bob follows
them to an ELABORATE CHAIR in the center of the dark lit

Would you like to find out

INTERCUT

Bob enters the computer record of the development of the
OMNIDROID It squares off Superheroes on one half of the
screen with progressively more advanced versions of the
Omnidroid A “TERMINATED” band blots out the loser of
each encounter

Bob’s eyes fill with horror Syndrome has been using
Superheroes to beta-test his Omnidroid killing machines
starting with the weaker Superheroes and working his way
up as the robots became more deadly

Face after face of deceased Superheroes flash by

Bob turns away staggered

He types in the name ELASTIGIRL Under “whereabouts” the
computer answers “UNKNOWN” Bob heaves a sigh of relief

stares at it not sure she wants to know what it may tell
her

As the dot over the “i” on his chest-logo LIGHTS UP
beeping Bob looks down in surprise An alarm sounds as
the room is awash in bright light Unwittingly Helen has
exposed him

Bob races for the exit but is hit by sticky balls of goo
fired from guns lining the walls which INFLATE quickly
making it impossible to run

Bob falls to the floor swallowed up by the expanding
goo

HELEN
I expect you to trust me

AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER THE OCEAN

A BOAT gains into the frame skimming over the water at a
great speed Violet appears to be the only passenger

CLOSER

We see that the boat is actually HELEN who has contorted
herself into a reasonable facsimile of an inflatable
raft and Dash-- facing backwards his legs pounding the
water furiously-- is the outboard motor

Violet sits impassively her long hair streaming in the
wind and tries to find something interesting to look at

The Incredi-boat speeds away from us heading toward the
missile trails’ origins and the horizon

NOMANISAN BEACH - EARLY EVENING

It is just after sunset when Helen Dash and Violet
stagger onto the beach hungry and exhausted

Helen collapses in an ungainly slightly stretched out
heap spent Her body slowly reverting into her usual
shape She looks at Dash with a tired smile

HELEN
What a trooper I’m so proud of you

Panting Dash smiles and gives her a weak wave

DASH
Thanks Mom

INSIDE A CAVE A LITTLE LATER

Helen and the kids huddle around a fire silent and
somber Helen finally breaks the silence

HELEN
I think your father is in trouble

VIOLET
If you haven’t noticed Mom we’re not
doing so hot either

HELEN
I’m going to look for him That means
youre in charge until I get back

Violet
DASH

VIOLET
(to Dash)

You heard her

Helen reaches into the battered duffle and removes three
MASKS She puts one on hands the other two to her kids

HELEN
Put these on Your identity is your most
valuable possession Protect it If
anything goes wrong use your powers

VIOLET
But you said we should never--

HELEN
I KNOW WHAT I SAID

Helen regrets her outburst at once She takes a deep
breath composes herself looks at her kids

HELEN (CONT‘D)

Remember the bad guys on those shows you
used to watch on Saturday morning

(the kids NOD eagerly)
Well these guys are not like those guys

(the kids deflate)
They won’t exercise restraint because
you’re children They will kill you if
they get the chance Do NOT give them
that chance Vi I’m counting on you

( )

VIOLET
Mom I--

HELEN
(cuts her off firm)
Im counting on you Be strong

Dash if anything goes wrong I want you
to run as fast as you can

DASH
(excited by this)
As fast as I can

HELEN
As fast as you can Stay hidden Keep

Helen gives them a long hug then turns to exit the cave
Violet looking tortured runs after her stops her at
the entrance Tears well up in Violet‘’s eyes

VIOLET
(excruciating for her)
Mom what happened on the plane when
you asked me t- I I wanted to-- I’m
SOLry

Helen places a finger over Vi’s lips Meets her gaze and
speaks in a warm sure tone

HELEN
Shh It isn’t your fault It wasn’t fair
for me to suddenly ask so much of you
But things are different now And doubt
is a luxury we can’t afford anymore
sweetie You have more power than you
realize Don’t think And don’t worry If
the time comes you’1l know what to do
It’s in your blood

Helen gives Violet a firm nod and disappears into the
night Violet watches her mother get swallowed by the
darkness She looks down at the mask in her hands
--and carefully puts it on

LAUNCH OBSERVATION CENTER - SYNDROME’S BASE - NIGHT

Lost in thought Syndrome stares down at the massive
vocket in the center of the volcano poised to launch

MIRAGE
He’s not weak you know

Mirage is seated at one of the many consoles taking
notes her back to him Syndrome snaps out of his dream
and turns to Mirage the only other person in the room

SYNDROME
What

MIRAGE
Valuing life is not weakness

Syndrome crosses to her casually dismissive

SYNDROME
Hey if youre talking about what
happened in the containment unit I had
everything under control--

MIRAGE
And disregarding it is not strength

Syndrome sidles up behind her lifts her chin with a
gentle hand and draws her face toward his

SYNDROME
I called his bluff sweetheart that’s
all I knew he wouldn’t have it in him to
actually--

Mirage shoves his hand aside and rises to confront him

MIRAGE
Next time you gamble bet your own life

She EXITS leaving Syndrome befuddled and alone
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

Helen enters a clearing and looks up A monorail track
soars high above the jungle floor A monopod is coming
Helen throws her hands high stretching them up to the
pod passing overhead It yanks her offscreen

MOVING THROUGH THE TREES

Helen hangs suspended beneath the pod on long arms
alternating hands to swing around the support columns
Gaining momentum with each swing she throws her body
above the roof of the car landing expertly on top

ON TOP OF THE POD

Helen squints into the rushing wind sees the track
slicing through the dense jungle canopy and leading
directly into the base of the towering volcano

A familiar HUM causes her to hide and she slips down one
side of the pod out of view as TWO HOVERJETS buzz by
Helen watches the jets descend to a landing strip inside
the Volcano just as the pod plunges into a tunnel and--

INSIDE THE TUNNEL - MOVING WITH HELEN ON THE POD

Darkness Suddenly an opening in the tunnel rushes by
and Helen catches a glimpse of the ROCKET and WHOOSH--
the pod is back into a tunnel

Helen stretches her torso out like a sail It catches
wind and she releases from the pod reforms and drops to
the tracks with catlike grace

INSIDE THE BASE - TUNNEL ENTRANCE

Helen peeks out of the tunnel looks out at the heavily
guarded launch pad

HELEN
A rocket

Visible inside the open tip of the rocket sits a huge
metallic wing with an enormous circular hole EMPTY in its
center waiting to be filled with what

ANOTHER CORRIDOR - LATER

Two armed GUARDS march past CAMERA Unseen above them
Helen is stretched thin and hiding between a cluster of
pipes which run down the center of the corridor She
watches as the guards exit through a sliding door

She drops like a liquid cat to the floor and begins to
move down the corridor

As Helen passes a metal door she catches sight of her
reflection in its shiny surface She stops FROWNS It’s
been a while since her last Supersuit her butt is a bit
bigger than she remembered She wonders if she should
lose a few--

-when the WHOOSH of a door surprises her

A GUARD

comes through the door at the far end of the hall As he
enters another junction we see that Helen has contorted
herself arching perfectly around the door frame

The GUARD doesn’t see her He slides a CARD KEY through a
reader to enter a restricted corridor The doors WHOOSH
open Directly behind him Helen silently REFORMS and
begins to back through the doorway when the doors behind
her SLIDE SHUT-

--trapping HELEN’S LEG She winces tries in vain to pull
it free It’s stuck Leaving one hope--

--the CARD KEY on GUARD 1S belt

STRETCHING across the corridor Helen clambers after the
guard on the palms of her hands following him into the--

INNER CHAMBER

The guard stops at the ELEVATOR and presses the call
button his back to Helen Just behind him stretched far
and held upright on one hand Helen reaches with the
other for the card key She almost has it--

AT THE CORRIDOR

The DOOR suddenly closes on her stretched torso Her
upper third snaps back her middle third TRAPPED and now
stretched across-

HALLWAY -— CENTRAL CORE

TWO MORE GUARDS (2 and 3) are traveling in a transport
They are suddenly CLOTHESLINED by HELEN’S STRETCHED
TORSO

INNER CHAMBER

-knocking the wind out of HELEN Directly in front of
her at the far end of the hall the ELEVATOR opens for
GUARD 1 revealing GUARD 4 inside He SEES HELEN

GUARD 4
Hey

Helen’s arm stretches forward--

INNER CHAMBER - INSIDE ELEVATOR

IN A BLINK her fist CLOCKS GUARD 4 disarms GUARD 1
hitting him with the butt of his gun AS guard 4 drops
to the floor 1 hits the “CLOSE” button on the panel

The DOORS CLOSE on Helen’s ARM Guard 1 GRINS Helen’s
HAND FEELS AROUND finds GUARD 1 his chest chin

-PUNCHES his lights out He DROPS

RESUME MIDDLE CORRIDOR

The TORSO GUARDS (2 and 3) get to their feet and see
HELEN her ARM still stretched through the glass door
They level their guns at her At the same moment-—

BLUE CORRIDOR

ANOTHER GUARD comes upon Helen’s LEG in the closed
doors The sight is so odd he can only stare He decides
to poke the leg with the barrel of his machine gun
WITH HELEN

-as she REACTS to the poke She SCOWLS--

RESUME BLUE CORRIDOR

-her LEG cocks back and FISHTAIL-KICKS GUARD 5 He
flies backwards his weapon discharging into the card

SMASH the TORSO GUARDS (2 and 3) against the middle door
They slide down into a heap out cold

INSIDE ELEVATOR

Helens arm finds one of the guards’ CARD KEY slides it
into the door scanner The doors OPEN releasing her
torso

ACCESS CORRIDOR

Helen drags the last of the UNCONSCIOUS GUARDS over to an
open wall panel and stuffs him inside with the others
She throws her weight against the panel finally getting
it shut
CLOSE ON A FORCE FIELD

--glowing purple and fluttering around a campfire it
struggles to take form and finally does trapping the
fires smoke inside

INSIDE THE CAVE - NIGHT

Dash watches as Violet practices intently She releases
the force field sphere the dark smoke ball rises
upwards Vi throws another force field recapturing the
smoke at the roof of the cave

Dash gets to his feet grabs a burning branch from the
fire to use as a torch

DASH
Welp not that this isn’t fun but I’m
gonna go look around

VIOLET
What do you think is going on here You
think we’re on vacation or something Mom
and Dads lives could be in jeopardy Or
worse their marriage

DASH

rocket’s massive weight slowly lifts into the air

INSIDE THE CAVE - TUNNEL ENTRANCE

A low RUMBLE and a subtle push of warm wind emanate from
the depths of the tunnel which begins to GLOW Dash’s
smile drops as he realizes it’s an enormous FIREBALL
rocketing towards him He turns and RUNS

WITH VIOLET

vi is still practicing force fields when the depths of
the cave begin to rumble and glow She looks up

DASH’S VOICE
Vailll Vi vi Vi vi vill

VIOLET
(Vi sees cave brightening)
What did you DO

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Dash and Violet race out of the cave getting clear just
as an enormous wall of FLAMES erupts after them They

look down with a shudder at how close they came A roar
behind them causes them to turn-- a ROCKET emerges from
the center of the volcano and soars into the night sky

CONTROL ROOM - DETENTION BLOCK

Helen looks down from some vents in the ceiling Silently
she stretches her neck until her head dangles down behind
the guards

HER POV

Helen scans the detention grid and notices a
tremendous spike of power to restrain the prisoner in

Helen quickly pulls her head back up through the vent in
the ceiling and EXITS

Abruptly Vi VANISHES Dash looks around in surprise

VIOLETS VOICE
Dash RUNI

Suddenly understanding-- Dash BOLTS jumping from the
transport and vanishing into the jungle It happens FAST

The GUARD’S head snaps toward the sound of Vi’s VOICE He
swings his rifle-- we hear a heavy THUD as Violets
(invisible) body is knocked from the transport a cloud
of dust surrounds an impression in the dirt

GUARD 2
They’re SUPERS

LEAD GUARD
GET THE BOY

3 GUARDS take off after Dash on VELOCIPODS

LEAD GUARD (CONTD)
Show yourself

RACING THROUGH THE JUNGLE

Dash BLASTS through the foliage on foot unbelievably
FAST a manned VELOCIPOD hot on his tail But the terrain
is dense uneven and difficult and Dash is forced to
adhere to the thin TRAIL winding through the growth

UP AHEAD

a SWARM of flies fusses in the air Suddenly Dash bursts

into view rocketing RIGHT THROUGH the SWARM BUGS
splatter Dash’s face like an interstate windshield--

DASH
AGGCCHH 1

Dash STUMBLES careens end over end through the
undergrowth like an Indy 500 car crash and finally
tumbles to a stop Unharmed but thoroughly REPULSED
Dash wipes his bug-spattered face and teeth

DASH (CONTD)
Achpppt PtTHWAAAGH PTHPT

A Velocipod bursts out of the brush after him and he
TAKES OFF tearing through the jungle

Running fast Dash grabs a LONG VINE-- which sends him
out in a wide arc that surprises the trailing GUARD HE
SHOOTS PAST Dash and roars off into the undergrowth Dash
releases the vine tumbling roughly to his feet and
RUNS

A Velocipod bursts out of the brush and is on top of him
Impossibly Dash ACCELERATES staying just ahead of it
He sees ANOTHER VINE grabs it and is PROPELLED UPWARDS-

ABOVE THE TREES

Dash explodes out of the canopy flailing out of
control He looks down and sees--

--the treetops suddenly DROP AWAY Dash is FALLING OFF A
CLIFF SCREAMING his ten-year-old lungs out as he--

--LANDS ON A VELOCIPOD Fleetingly astonished by his
good luck DASH LOOKS UP as the startled GUARD whirls
around to face him The guard SWINGS Dash DUCKS and
reluctantly throws a PUNCH at the guard’s face It lands

Thrilled that his raw speed renders the guard powerless
to dodge or return his punches Dash LAUGHS and growing
more confident with each punch socks the GUARD again and
again blissfully unaware that NO ONE IS DRIVING

Dash LOOKS UP His jaw drops a ROCK WALL looms ahead

Dash POINTS at it The GUARD sees an opening and SOCKS
Dash in the face knocking him off just as-

--the velocipod slams into the cliff face vaporizing in
a FIREBALL

Dash FALLS making desperate flailing GRABS as he HITS
limb after limb of an enormous tree finally getting hold
of a branch and arresting his descent He pants heart
racing and looks down to see-

--his feet dangling about a yard off the jungle floor
Flated about his survival Dash drops to the ground and
lets out a loud WHOOP immediately alerting--

TWO GUARDS ON VELOCIPODS
nearby to his presence They turn their Vpods after him
WITH DASH

as he BOLTS again accelerating to breakneck speed He
smashes through an endless succession of FOLIAGE-- nearly
colliding with tree trunks and rocks and SUDDENLY--

A LAGOON lies in front of him Dash REACTS the VPODS
are on his tail he has nowhere to go so he takes a deep
breath and STEPS ON IT--

--and has enough velocity to RUN ACROSS THE WATER Amazed
and exhilarated Dash blasts across the waters surface
weaving like a speedboat around the large volcanic ROCKS
jutting out of the water

Velocipods OPEN FIRE strafing the water as Dash is
pursued into a CAVE

VELOCIPOD 2 pulls up short at the cave entrance and
chooses to go around

INSIDE THE CAVE

Dash runs Velocipod on his heels Weaves around rocks
manages to put some distance between himself and
Velocipod when he sees--

V-POD 2 coming straight at him Dash wheels around his

legs churning the water like an eggbeater He SEES VPOD

1 closing fast HE HAS NOWHERE TO GO and like a deer in
headlights Dash STOPS--

-suddenly dropping beneath the water’s surface as the
Velocipods COLLIDE-- BOOOM

SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - MOVING - SAME MOMENT

Bob and Helen run not tired but breathing hard--

( )

BOB
I shouldve told you I was fired I admit
it but I didn’t want you to worry-

HELEN
You didn’t want me to worry And now
were running for our lives through some
godforsaken jungle

BOB

You keep trying to pick a fight but I’m

still just happy you’re alive--
ANOTHER PART OF THE JUNGLE - VIOLET and THE GUARD
The remaining GUARD waits his machine gun at the ready
Suddenly the dirt MOVES The guard FIRES strafing the
ground just behind a SUCCESSION OF FOOTPRINTS that streak
toward the river moments before a SPLASH appears
THE RIVER - UNDER THE WATER’S SURFACE

We see a Violetshaped DISTORTION as BULLET TRAILS
furiously slice the surrounding water

WITH THE GUARD

--still firing He STOPS unnerved and adrenalized
Tensed and ready he nervously scans the river

GUARD 1

I know you’re there little Miss

Disappear You can’t hide from me
Training his gun where he last saw Violet the GUARD
grabs a handful of dirt from the riverbank and throws it
into the water He shoulders his RIFLE watching the dirt
turn into a brown CLOUD as it travels downstream
emaking visible a VIOLET-SHAPED POCKET

GUARD 1 (CONTD)
there you are

The guard TAKES AIM and--
DASH BLURS PAST--

DASH
HEY

(

--KNOCKING the guard’s gun barrel skyward as it FIRES
The guard swings around-- strafing the ground at DASH’S
heels as he plunges back into the jungle

A SPLASH explodes from the river as INVISIBLE VIOLET
makes a break for it THE GUARD sees this and swings the
gun toward her as-

DASH blasts out of the jungle and knocks the Guard’s legs
out from under him They TUMBLE and scrap Dash redeeming
his lack of size with lightning-fast punches and feints

DASH (CONT’‘D)
Stay away from my sister

Disoriented the guard swings and-

CONNECTS-- knocking Dash off his feet He tumbles
backward dazed The guard shoulders his rifle leveling
it at Dash Dash looks up sees he’s screwed The guard
GRINS wickedly and pulls the trigger-

Violet suddenly APPEARS in mid-air diving in front of
Dash as she THROWS A FORCE FIELD around them A hail of
bullets ricochet off the force field

INSIDE THE FORCE FIELD

Dash looks up sees Violet SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR in the
center of the ELECTRIC SPHERE

DASH
How are you doing that

VIOLET
I don’t know

DASH
Well whatever you do-- DON’T STOP

WIDER

as Dash starts to walk within the force field like a
gerbil on a wheel Violet spins ever faster in the
sphere’s hub as Dash accelerates into a run

The GUARDS empty their clips at the ROLLING SPHERE with
no effect It rumbles past them and straight into the
jungle

MOVING WITH THE ROLLING FORCE FIELD

as it carries Dash and Vi down a steep hillside into the
path of two speeding VELOCIPODS who FIRE at the sphere
Its clipped by one Velocipod- which then spirals into a
rock and EXPLODES

A JUNGLE CLEARING NOT FAR AWAY - SAME MOMENT

Bob and Helen hear the EXPLOSION’S echo and STOP
worried That’s when they hear the RUMBLE Before they
can get clear the ROLLING FORCE FIELD bursts out of the
brush-

INSIDE THE SPHERE

The children REACT as their surprised PARENTS flatten
against the force field like dough against a rolling pin
revolving in and out of view

VIOLET and DASH
Mom DADI

RESUME WIDE VIEW

Violet VANISHES the force field and the entire family
tumbles to the jungle floor

BOB and HELEN
KIDS

There is a frantic joyful exchange of hugs and kisses
unfortunately cut short when--

VELOCIPODS explode out of the foliage The INCREDIBLES
instantly jump to their feet

Helen throws a STRETCHED SCISSORS KICK which catches a
guard in the chest knocking him out of his V-pod Bob
CHOPS a second passing velocipod-- it PLOWS straight into
the soft jungle floor Before its PILOT can react--

--Helen’s arm is coiled around him She YANKS him from
the vehicle whiplashing him into another guard knocking
them both out cold Bob grabs the crashed V-pod and
Frisbees it into a V-pod emerging from the trees--
BOOOOM

And it’s OVER Bob and Helen had forgotten how good they
were They exchange lustful glances

( )

BOB and HELEN (CONTD)
(to each other)
I love you

Suddenly the jungle is filled with GUARDS and VELOCIPODS
And just as quickly the INCREDIBLES turn as one against
them a hurricane blur of SUPERPOWERS suddenly brought
to a CRASHING HALT-

--AS IMMOBI-RAYS strike the Incredibles SUSPENDING them
all motionless in MID-AIR

The Incredibles hang in mid-air defeated as a live
NEWSCAST covers the terrifying Omnidroid attack

BOB
I‘m sorry

The others look up in dull surprise at Bob’s confession

BOB (CONT’D)
This is my fault I’ve been a lousy
father Blind to what I have

Behind Bob Violet begins to rock back and forth
revealing that she’s suspended not in Syndrome’s Ray but
in the center of her own force field

BOR (CONTD)
So obsessed with being undervalued that IT
undervalued all of you

DASH

HELEN
Shi Don’t interrupt

BOB
So caught up in the past that I I--
(Bob hesitates sincere)
--you are my greatest adventure And I
almost missed it

Violet has gathered enough momentum to ROLL her sphere
out of the suspension beam and over to the control panel

BOB (CONTD)
I swear I’m gonna get us out of this if--

VIOLET
(interrupting)
Well I think Dad has made some excellent
progress today But it’s time to wind
down now--

Violet throws a switch releasing the Incredibles from

I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in
Straight ahead I think--—

Bob’s hands pry open the heavy metal doors crunching
them like foil The INCREDIBLES enter the huge HANGAR
unmolested

BOB
Where are all the guards
(to family)

Go go

Laughter drifts out of a large Winnebago crowned with
transmission arrays parked near the launchpad

INSIDE THE WINNEBAGO

The GUARDS watch live coverage of the OMNIDROID attack on
a video monitor Champagne is popped the cork is
unexpectedly CAUGHT by someone standing in the doorway-

--MR INCREDIBLE The guards fall SILENT

OUTSIDE THE MOBILE UNIT

The vehicle ROCKS as Bob quickly punches out the guards
within In moments Bob emerges whistles to his family
that the coast is clear

HELEN
This is the hangar but I don‘t see any
jets

BOB

A jet’s not fast enough

HELEN
Whats faster than a jet

DASH
How about a rocket

The other Incredibles follow Dash’s finger to an enormous
shield-shaped ROCKET identical to the one launched
earlier-- save for a perfect circular hole in the center

HELEN
Great I can’t fly a rocket

VIOLET
You don’t have to Use the coordinates
from the last Launch

Bob and Helen BEAM at their daughter’s cleverness Then
Bob‘s smile FADES

straining under the weight of it

carefully sets Violet down She looks at Dash and Vi

Stay here Okay

Helen turns away charging back toward the robot Vi and
Dash watch their fearless mother in amazement

WITH BOB AND THE OMNIDROID

as the bot pulls itself up the building to look for Bob
Bob charges the bot hitting it with enough force to
dislodge it from the building It FALLS crashing into
the street with an earth-shattering BOOM

Bob falls with it but rolls and lands on his feet The
familiar sound of cracking ice causes Bob to look up--

BOB
Frozone YEAH

A narrow sheet of ice streaks across the pavement and
FROZONE skates past joining the fight

FOLLOWING FROZONE

He moves to the Omnidroid expertly icing its joints as
it tries to get up The machine WHINES as its motors
strain against the ice

FURTHER DOWN THE STREET
Helen rushes up to Bob

HELEN
Bob-—

Just then Frozone sails into frame and crashes into the
roof of a parked car Bob turns angrily toward the robot--

BOB
HEY--

--and is immediately SMACKED by the robot Bob flies into
the side of a building and tumbles to the street

Frozone and Helen distract the robot heckling it and
spreading out It goes after them like an enraged beast

Dazed Bob looks up and sees a strange device on the
ground in front of him He examines it his eyes widening
when he realizes what it is He holds it up yelling
excitedly to the others--

BOB (CONTD)
SYNDROME ’S REMOTE

WHAM The bot comes down on Bob like a ton of bricks
lifting him high above the ground Miraculously Bob has
held on to the remote and he quickly stabs at the
buttons hoping to get lucky

With a BOOM one of the bot’s limbs RELEASES sending it—-
and Bob-- crashing to the ground

AROUND THE CORNER
Violet sees this She turns to Dash

VIOLET
The remote controls the robot

WITH BOB AND THE OMNIDROID

The Omnidroid knows this too and it fires laser blasts
at Bob to try to stop Bob from using the remote Bob
jumps clear then hears his son from down the street

DASH
Hey Dad Throw it Throw it

BOB
GO LONG

Bob gives the remote a MONSTER THROW flinging it high
into the air and across the river Dash pivots and takes
off after it The Omni sees Dash and starts firing after
him

WITH DASH

as he hits the water jetting across the water’s surface
as the Omni fires away The water EXPLODES around Dash
but he concentrates on the remote following it into his
hands like an NFL receiver

DASH
I Got iT

Dash crosses the river and hits the streets on the other
side seemingly home free But the Omni is still FIRING
and it hits some cars in Dash’s path igniting their gas
tanks Suddenly Dash is surrounded by a wall of FLAMES

WITH BOB

He runs toward Helen who is closer to the Omnidroid

BOB
HONEY TAKE OUT ITS GUNS
HELEN

hears him She grabs a heavy MANHOLE COVER winding her
elastic arm around a light pole to fling it-- like an
arrow-- at the OMNIDROID’S gun Bull’s-eye

ACROSS THE RIVER

What follows amounts to a game of hot potato between the
Supers and the robot over the remote

Frozone saves Dash from the circle of burning cars The
Robot sees this and goes after them With Dash on his
back Frozone races across the river freezing it in
front of him as he goes

The robot JUMPS-- almost on top of them creating a

MASSIVE WAVE and throwing Dash and Frozone high into the
air Thinking fast Frozone turns the wave into a wall of
SNOW It crashes over the streets cushioning their fall

IN THE STREET NEARBY

The remote clatters to the ground Bob sees it and runs
for it The bot sees Bob and fires a claw-- catching Bob
just as he was reaching for the remote The CLAW-- with
Bob inside-- tumbles end over end down the street With
Bob out of the way the bot heads for the remote

Frozone ices the robot’s path causing the bot’s metal
feet to slip and slide Helen runs ahead of the bot
stretching herself into a tripwire across the stumbling
robots path It CRASHES to the street

The bot LOOKS UP The remote lies on the street just in
front of it easily within its grasp The bot reaches out
with a claw to destroy the remote The remote magically
JUMPS CLEAR The bot tries again and again the remote
darts away Riled now the bot rears up and STABS wildly
at the remote with all of its arms We hear VIOLET
shriek as the remote repeatedly eludes the robot’s
grasp finally tangling its legs so badly that it topples
over

Vi REAPPEARS running back to rejoin the group in the
middle of the street

Violet begins to fiddle with the remote’s CLICK-WHEEL

ROCKETS FIRE underneath the robot’s clawed feet lifting
the enormous machine into the air

Everyone ducks as the robot rockets overhead crashing
into a building at the end of the street Like a woozy
prizefighter the Omnidroid gets back on its feet

street toward the approaching robot He JUMPS off an ice
ramp his skates CONVERTING into a circular ski-dise in
mid-air He lands throwing a massive ICE WALL in front

As he closes the claw into a massive arrowhead and starts
charging down the street

EVERYBODY DUCK

--and RELEASES IT The giant metal arrow roars overhead
and drills clean through the robot’s body coming out the
other side For a long moment nothing happens Then the
gargantuan machine KEELS OVER and EXPLODES It’s over

The family looks at each other stunned Frozone starts
to chuckle Bob smiles as he looks at his Super family
It feels like his best memories only better

The seemingly empty city begins to come to life as
people emerge from their hiding places converging in the
street People begin to spontaneously CHEER the heroes
welcoming the Supers’ return Two ELDERLY GENTLEMEN stand
together in the crowd One nudges the other

FRANK
See that That’s the way you do it
That‘s Old School

OLLIE
Yup No school like the Old School

ON A NEARBY ROOFTOP

SYNDROME comes to Looks over the edge to the streets
below to find the battle over and the masses cheering-
not for him but for the group of Supers He DARKENS

SYNDROME
No--

WITH FROZONE AND THE INCREDIBLES

They drink in the cheers as the adoring crowd gathers
around them

FROZONE
Just like old times

BOB
Just like old times

Bob slaps Frozone on the back a little too hard Frozone
shakes it off

FROZONE
Yeah Hurt then too

EXT CITY STREETS - MOVING - DUSK
A long black LIMO cruises down the street
INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Bob sits proudly with his family as Rick Dicker debriefs
them Everyone is enjoying the moment save for Helen
who has already clicked back into “mother-mode” and is
using the car phone to get messages

DICKER
Weve frozen all his assets If Syndrome
even sneezes we’ll be there with a hanky
and a pair of handcuffs The people of
this country are indebted to you Well

BOB
Does this mean we can come out of hiding

DICKER
Let the politicians figure that one out
But I’ve been asked to assure you that
well take care of everything else You

Dash plays with the electric windows as Helen retrieves
messages from the car phone Window up window down

KARI‘’S VOICE

to a stop in front of their home--

DICKER

KARIS VOICE
(through phone calmer)
Hi this is Kari Sorry for freaking out
But your baby has special needs Anyway

HELEN
(looks at Bob alarmed)
“Replacement” I didn’t call for a
replacement

Bob’s eyes widen He and Helen jump from the car
followed by the kids They cross the lawn and burst
through the front door to REVEAL--

SYNDROME

who SPINS hitting the family with his ZERO-POINT RAY
Cradling a sleeping Jack-Jack in his arms he grins

SYNDROME
Shh The baby’s sleeping

He CACKLES The Incredibles are frozen and helpless in
the grasp of the ZERO-POINT Only their eyes betray their
desperation

SYNDROME (CONTD)
You took away my future I’m simply
returning the favor Dont worry Ill be
a good mentor supportive encouraging
Everything you weren’t And in time who
knows He might make a good sidekick

Syndrome FLINGS the family into the bookcase He points
his power band toward the roof and blows a huge hole in
it revealing his MANTA JET hovering high above Syndrome
fires his jet-boots and TAKES OFF toward the jet

HELEN
Hes getting away Bob We have to do
something We have to do something now

ASCENDING WITH SYNDROME and JACK-JACK - DUSK

JACK-JACK awakens to the sight of his family and home
receding beneath him He CRIES reaching out for them

Syndrome nears the MANTA JET JACK-JACK’S crying turns
angry and suddenly he BURSTS INTO FLAMES Syndrome
shrieks Jack-Jack’s fire goes out revealing that the
baby has turned to METAL

Syndrome DROPS with the sudden weight His jetboots
compensate but Syndrome is struggling to stay aloft The
baby’s flesh reverts to normal but the baby begins to
VIBRATE fiercely Syndrome can barely keep hold of him
ON THE GROUND

Helen turns to Bob panicked

HELEN
Something’s happening Whats happening

RESUME SYNDROME and JACKJACK

The vibrating baby begins to REDDEN TRANSFORMING
abruptly into mini-MONSTER The Jack-Jack monster throws
a headlock around Syndrome laughing maniacally and
starts to RIP APART Syndrome’s Jet-boots

ON THE GROUND

Bob and Helen watch helplessly

HELEN
We have to stop him Throw something

BOB
Iocan’t I might hit Jack-Jack

HELEN
(realization softly)
Throw me

WITH SYNDROME AND JACK-JACK

Jack-Jack RIPS a valve from Syndrome’s jet-boots which
PROPELS him upward slamming his head into the jet’s
wing He loses hold of Jack-Jack who FALLS--

ON THE GROUND

Helen SEES THIS turns to Bob--

HELEN
Bob-- THROW ME

Helen leaps into Bob’s arms forming into a SPEAR shape
BOB takes aim and FLINGS HER toward the falling baby

IN THE SKY

HELEN SOARS-- and GRABS JACK-JACK She quickly BLOOMS
into a parachute

INTEXT MANTA JET

SYNDROME regains control He successfully docks with the
hovering Manta Jet He stands at the docking doors his
cape blowing dramatically upwards

SYNDROME
THIS ISNT THE END OF IT

ON THE GROUND

Bob looks around wildly for a way to get at Syndrome and
spies his sports car Regret flashes across his face--

EXT MANTA JET

SYNDROME
I WILL GET YOUR SON I’LL- oh no

Syndrome’s eyes go wide BOB‘S CAR is soaring toward him
tumbling end over end towards the MANTA JET Syndrome
jumps back as the crafts COLLIDE blowing him off his
feet and up over the wing toward the turbines

Clawing madly to find purchase he LOOKS over his

shoulder in time to see the end of his CAPE sucked into
the intake Syndrome SCREAMS as he’s YANKED OUT OF FRAME-
ON THE GROUND

BOB DASH and VI react as the MANTA JET EXPLODES

DESCENDING WITH HELEN AND JACK-JACK

Helen cradles Jack-Jack facing upwards his back toward
the ground He looks at her giggling and cooing

HELEN
Look at Mommy honey Don’t look down
Mommy’s got you Everything’s alright

But Jack-Jack sees burning wreckage coming toward them
and starts to SHRIEK pointing upwards Helen turns to
see it as--

WRECKAGE CRASHES ON TOP OF THEM DESTROYING THE PARR
HOME HELEN and JJ ARE SAVED VI AND HELEN EXCHANGE A
MEANINGFUL LOOK

HELEN (CONT’D)
That’s my girl

DASH
Does this mean we have to move again

Everyone chuckles at this The smoke begins to clear
REVEALING a lone witness to this cataclysmic event--

--the Big Wheel KID whose eyes are as big as dinner
plates

KID
Ooohh man THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED

FADE TO BLACK
EXT PARKER STADIUM - DAY - THREE MONTHS LATER

The stadium parking lot is about half full ona
beautiful cloudless day The marquee announces JUNIOR
HIGH TRACK FINALS

INSIDE THE STADIUM

Young runners loosen up at the starting line of the
hundred-yard dash Dash is among them He waves to the
stands

IN THE STANDS

Bob Helen and Jack-Jack wave back Coming down the steps
is none other than Violet’s crush TONY RYDINGER He
waves cooly at some friends and heads toward the
concession stand PAUSING when he sees Violet and a
friend talking nearby He approaches them

( )

TONY
(to Violet)
Hey

Violet silences Tony with a single finger on his lips
Tony stares at her in shock and wonder

VIOLET

TONY
Yeah Good A movie Okay Friday

VIOLET
(big smile)

ON THE FIELD

The starter pistol FIRES and the runners take off Dash
jogs well behind the pack in a confident easy trot

In the stands Bob Helen and Violet cheer Dash on

(

BOB HELEN and VIOLET
Gol Go Dash GO Run Run RUN
(etc)

Dash hears them and looks toward the stands

BOB and HELEN
GO DASH GO POUR IT ON SON HIT THE
GAS (etc)

Dash his eyes still on his family accelerates a little
and quickly moves toward the front of the pack

BOB and HELEN (CONT‘D)
—-BUT NOT TOO MUCHI PULL IT BACK PULL
IT BACK EASE UP Slow down a littlel

Dash clearly confused now furrows his brows as he again
drops back The family shouts LOUDER-

BOB and HELEN (CONT’D)
But dont give up Make it close--
SECOND GO FOR SECOND A CLOSE SECOND

Understanding Dash accelerates just enough to scare the
leader crossing the finish line inches behind him

IN THE STANDS

the Incredibles are ecstatic They cheer and laugh and
jostle each other as if Dash had won Olympic gold Dash
stands in the cluster of panting red-faced boys not
even winded and beams at his proud family

BOB (0S)
That’s my boy

STADIUM PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

The family crosses the parking lot Dash sitting atop
Bobs shoulders clutching his second-place trophy
Everyone is happy and together

HELEN
You were great out there honey Were so
proud of you

DASH

I saw you in the stands I didn’t know
what the heck you wanted me to do

The ground begins to QUAKE The INCREDIBLES stop as the
low RUMBLE grows louder On the far side of the lot cars
begin to be thrown into the air tossed about like toys

A GARGANTUAN DRILL spirals out of the ground throwing
dirt and chunks of asphalt in all directions People run
screaming as the enormcus metallic vehicle crests and
crashes to earth A door opens on top and a hulking
figure in dirty overalis emerges atop a rising platform

His ragged voice amplified through a loudspeaker the
UNDERMINER speaks-—

UNDERMINER
BEHOLD THE UNDERMINER I’M ALWAYS BENEATH
YOU BUT NOTHING IS BENEATH ME I HEREBY
DECLARE WAR ON PEACE AND HAPPINESS ALL
WILL TREMBLE BEFORE ME (etc)

CAMERA pans off Bob as he glances at his family They’ve
already donned their masks ready as theyll ever be
CAMERA returns to Bob revealing that he too has put on
his mask

He turns toward their new nemesis and SMILES RIPS his
shirt OPEN TO REVEAL the “i” insignia on the chest of his
Supersuit underneath the logo of-

--THE INCREDIBLES

THE END
