INT FRONT HALL
Jill reaches the front door Carefully quietly she
the bolt Then 0S she hears a creak She turns and

up the staircase At the top a door is opening

coming out A mumbling sound is heard on the sound

Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it It

but only an inch The chain is still across it She
frantically works to get the chain free After

seconds the chain falls clear and the door swings

Standing there on the other side of the door is a
Detective JOHN CLIFFORD (We have cut ahead in time
twenty or thirty minutes) Behind him on the street
patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb
domelights silently flashing

CLIFFORD
Are the parents here yet

COPS VOICE (0S)

CLIFFORD

COPS VOICE (0S)
They wanted to talk to someone I

Clifford sighs and steps into the front hall The door

is

closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been

speaking The cop is a man in his thirties His name is

CHARLES GARBER Garber and Clifford stand in the front
hall

and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move
around

them In the living room beyond can be seen several
other

POLICEMEN Dr Mandrakis and his wife

GARBER
We were only a block away when the

CLIFFORD

FADE

FADE IN
EXT STREET - LATER AFTERNOON
An upper-class neighborhood The CAMERA is facing down
street A car approaches the intersection at the end of
block turns and comes slowly up the street
Because it is not a new car or an expensive car and
it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole
occupant is looking for house numbers we can assume
the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood
The CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns
the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to
front door
A TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen

430 pm Thursday April 20 1978
As the TITLE FADES the driver shuts off the car engine

opens the door to get out

INT MANSION - DAY

face

is

goes to the door and opens it for the visitor It is
Clifford the detective from six years ago

He has aged noticeably over the years His hair is

his stance not so aggressive but his eyes still

with the accumulated frustration of having spent years
uncertain sometimes unsatisfying and frequently
occupation

No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford
the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs
keen in his observation of things Clifford quickly
this new atmosphere

The house is richly decorated but with an underlying
of melancholy There are no bright or cheerful

and the houseboy advances with guarded tread his face
and reverent

The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the
and raps lightly on it with his knuckles Without

for an answer he opens the door and steps aside for
to enter

Clifford pauses briefly then walks into what appears
an upstairs study

INT STUDY - DAY

A MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door
Presumably he is the master of the house Although his

is hidden in shadows we can see from his hands that he

engaged in writing something down
Clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat

in

front of it Then vaguely in keeping with the spirit
of the

house he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt
the

pervasive stillness

After a moment the master of the house lays down his
pen

and leans back in his chair Pause

MASTER
So youre in business for yourself
now

CLIFFORD
(quietly)
Yes sir for the past three anda
half years

MASTER
Thats good
(beat)
And youd heard about Curt Duncans
escape

CLIFFORD
Oh yes

MASTER
Do you think the police will find
him

Pause

CLIFFORD
I know they havent assigned anyone
to it specifically Its an old case

MASTER
(a tinge of bitterness)
An old case
(beat)
Can you find him

CLIFFORD
Yes Maybe not tomorrow maybe not
this week but Ill find him

MASTER
He could be anywhere by now
CLIFFORD
I dont think so because hes a
foreigner Hell come back to the
city After six years in confinement
its the only place thats familiar
to him Thats important

Pause

MASTER
A man murders two children in cold
blood A jury declares him insane
How could such a person not be

Clifford lowers his eyes doesnt answer

MASTER
He is sent to a state mental
institution where the security is
less than perfect And he escapes
It it isnt fair

The master of the house leans way forward over his

desk and
his face comes out of the shadows and into the light
It is
Dr Mandrakis
He seems much older His complexion is pallid His eyes
stare
out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding
ina
dark cave
MANDRAKIS
A thing like that should never be
allowed to happen again
CLIFFORD
I couldnt agree with you more
They look at each other for a long moment of
acknowledgment

Then Mandrakis stands up with a sigh

MANDRAKIS
Go ahead then My accountant will
contact you

Clifford stands and they shake hands
the

staircase

in her

Mandrakis

CUT TO

CLIFFORD
Thank you
(beat)
How is Mrs Mandrakis

MANDRAKIS
She is unable to have any more
children

CLIFFORD

Im sorry Please give her my best

MANDRAKIS
Of course

Clifford turns to go

INT MANSION - STAIRCASE and ENTRANCE HALL

As Clifford finds his own way down the stairs and out
front door

A WOMAN watches Clifford leave from the back of the
It is Mrs Mandrakis As with her husband the change
is remarkable She is now a brooding barren woman
OS the front door closes Clifford is gone Mrs

walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly
ascending them

The houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from

side door and watches her

INT A HALLWAY - MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY

A male PATIENT wearing green institutional pajamas and
slippers shuffles slowly up the hall His movement is
catatonic unfocused

Canned Musak faintly underscores the scene
MANS VOICE (0S)

Standing in the doorway of an office facing into the
watching the patient

We had him for six years under
continuous therapy some of it rather
forceful

ANGLE ON PATIENT

Moving past CAMERA He is really out of it It is a
depressing vaguely unnerving sight

ANGLE ON CLIFFORD

He turns and goes back into the office

INT OFFICE - DAY
We see now the MAN whos been talking -- the director
State Hospital DR MONK He is sitting comfortably
his desk his jacket off his tie loosened his feet up
the desk He is very matter-of-fact
DR MONK

Eventually anyone will respond to

the treatment here
Clifford sits down in front of the desk picks up a

and leafs through it

CLIFFORD
You gave him electric shock

DR MONK
Yeah we zapped him a few times
Its fairly standard

CLIFFORD
folder

takes
closes

and

his

folder

It says here thirty-eight thirty-
eight times

Monk shrugs then yawns expansively He neednt justify
himself to the layman

CLIFFORD
What will happen to him now without
the drugs he was on

DR MONKS SECRETARY enters the office and hands hima
Without interrupting the delivery of his lines Monk
the folder opens it initials something on the inside
the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns
leaves the office without uttering a word

DR MONK
Therell be some deterioration Thats
inevitable but we cant say how
much

Pause Clifford looks at the doctor as if questioning
casual assessment of some deterioration

CLIFFORD
During the time that you had him
here did you discover any particular
habits of his peculiarities quirks
anything that might help me find
him

DR MONK
(shrugging again)
Its all in the folder
CLIFFORD
Any letters from people back in
England Family

DR MONK
That too is in the folder

Clifford directs a bleak look back down at the open
then looks up again his eyes narrowing

CLIFFORD
Lets get something straight here
Doctor Ive been 33 years in the
business of tracking people down and
putting them away I spent almost a
year on Curt Duncan alone with the
trial the testimonies the background
investigations I didnt come here
today to look in your goddamn folders
In fact I wouldnt have come here

at all if youd done your job right

Pause

DR MONK
Mr Clifford this is a hospital
not a penitentiary Everything that
pertains to one of our patients is
meticulously recorded in that
patients folder whether you can
make sense of it or not

They glare at each other for several seconds Monk is
the
first one to look away

DR MONK

Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-
schizophrenic They see themselves
as victims and they always blame
other people for the way they are
When Duncan killed the Mandrakis
kids it wasnt an act of hostility
against the children but against
their parents He was getting back
at his own parents for traumas he
suffered in early childhood The
criminal side of Curt Duncan is one
of terrible symbolic vengeance

CLIFFORD
(looking up)
Assuming he isnt found right away
what will happen to him

Monk rises and walks to a window

DR MONK
I think youll find him Somebody
will find him He cant function out
there Hell make a mistake
(turning to face
Clifford)

This is where he belongs After six
years in here hes suddenly gone

Monk looks back out the window

EXT CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Not a terribly good section of town We are looking at
nondescript exterior of a bar across the street

INT BAR

This is not a slum bar but its close There are a few
and chairs and a pool table in the back The atmosphere
quiet almost depressed and the handful of REGULARS
are exercising their privacy without having to be

They include HANK the bartender also the owner who
absently polishes things with his cloth TRACY an
woman in her mid-forties who sits at the bar witha

and a cigarette and silently rummages through her

feelings -- none of them new or particularly hopeful a
COUPLE probably retired sitting at the same table

come to every afternoon at this time -- him for his
her for a glass of sweet white wine and BILL at the
table a young man lithe and powerful minding his own
business and playing his game of pool with a steady

aggressive concentration

Then the door opens to the outside and the yellow-
light of late afternoon floods into the bar The

turn to glimpse whos coming in They see the figure of
MAN silhouetted in the doorway He stands there for a
moment not coming in Finally even Bill interrupts his
to turn and look

HANK
Cmon in and shut the door

The intruder enters indecisively The door swings shut
him plunging the room back into darkness This man is
little weird and the regulars continue to stare at
until he makes his way to a table near the wall and
down Then everyone returns to his own thoughts
HANK
(after a moment)
What1ll it be

Hey Whatll it be

A bit startled a bit defensive toward the directness

harried He hasnt slept or shaved in at least a couple

days and is wearing regular clothing

He clears his throat to answer
CLIFFORD (0S)
What kind of clothes was he wearing
when he escaped

CUT TO
INT DR MONKS OFFICE -DAY
Clifford is looking through the folder again

DR MONK
Ordinary street clothes Not all of
our patients have to wear the green
Gucci gowns

CLIFFORD
Did he have any money with him

DR MONK
Probably But not more than say
fifty dollars Some of the patients
are given little jobs around the
ward for which they are paid Its
part of the rehabilitation

Looking down Clifford pauses over a page in the
folder

CLOSEUP - FACT SHEET IN FOLDER

A page of legibly organized facts and statistics about

Curt
Duncan One of the entries reads Guy du Marraux

CLIFFORD (0S)
(reading)
Whats Guy du Mar--

DR MONK (0S)
(pronouncing it
correctly)

Guy du Marraux syndrom

BACK TO SCENE

DR MONK
Its a psycho-motor dysfunction

CLIFFORD
Duncan had it
DR MONK
Only from time to time which is
unusual

CLIFFORD
What is it

DR MONK
It attacks the nervous system People
suffering from it are irresistibly
compelled to utter obscenities
sometimes one sometimes a whole
string of them They cant control
it

CLIFFORD
(somewhat taken aback)
Are you being serious

DR MONK
Yeah Here Ill give you an example

He opens a file cabinet drawer finds a reel of
quarter-inch

magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a
recorder on

his desk

DR MONK
Duncan never had the twitch that
sometimes goes with it And with
Duncan as I said the disease would
only manifest itself in periods of
extreme anxiety When he was really
flipping out in other words

There is a pause as Monk fiddles with the tape recorder
and
Clifford looks back down at the folder

CLIFFORD
Duncan was Catholic

DR MONK
Yeah
(beat)
So am I

CLIFFORD
(mildly surprised)
That makes three of us
DR MONK
Is that right So we all share the
same guilt

Clifford smiles Monk keeps fiddling

DR MONK
Here This is Curt Duncan shortly
after he was admitted here in 1972

Monk turns on the tape recorder as Clifford sits
forward in
his chair to listen

At first nothing can be heard Then there is a click
as if

the machine was turned on in the middle of a
conversation

DR MONK (0S)

-- to put the situation right The

hypodermic needles are only used to
give you medication that will calm
you down They make you feel good

relaxed All right

(no answer)

Were not putting anything in your
food either The food is just food

DUNCAN (0S)
(extremely agitated)
No I dont eat the food It doesnt
taste right

DR MONK
(to Clifford)
Thats Duncan

Clifford nods and keeps listening

DR MONK (0S)
Curt why are you fidgeting Cant
you get comfortable

DUNCAN (0S)
No Im not comfortable

DR MONK (0S)
Wait a -- Hey
(to someone else)
Hold him down there Grab him Never
mind the chair
There are scuffling noises underneath which can be
heard

heavy breathing and then getting louder and more
furious

Duncan falling into the throes of Guy du Marraux

DR MONK (0S)
(periodically
interjecting)
Pull him down Thats right
Just lay him out Lay him right
out Steady Pull out his knees

Finally Monk is heard no more and Duncan continues with
the

frightening verbal torrent of Guy du Marraux

INT BAR - LATE AFTERNOON - CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

Sitting at his table inside the bar He takes a long

noisy

drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks It
tastes

good being the first real drink hes had in over six
years

But Duncan cannot relax enough to enjoy it fully His
eyes

are ever restlessly suspiciously moving about

ANGLE ON BAR

As Bill walks up and stands next to Tracy Hank moves
off to

get Bill another beer

Tracy looks up at Bill and smiles As regulars at the
same

bar they are loose and comfortable with each other

Tracy at the bar

POV - DUNCAN

Looking at the back of Tracy She reaches into her

ON TRACY

She takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse She
out a cigarette taps it lightly on the bar puts it to
lips

OS we hear the sound of a match being struck

WIDER ANGLE

Duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match He

it forward at her It goes out
Duncan fumbles for another match as Tracy regards him
with
undisguised repulsion Duncan gets the second match lit
and
holds it out for her She accepts the favor and lights
her
cigarette
Duncan smiles Tracy nods and turns away Duncan is
still
holding the burning match for her to blow out As it
doesnt
look like shes going to he lets it drop still lit
to the
floor
REACTION SHOT - BARTENDER
He gives a look as if to say Jesus what a fuckin
weirdo
TWO SHOT - DUNCAN AND TRACY
Pause Duncan is still smiling at her
DUNCAN
Hi
No response
DUNCAN

TRACY
(looking at him)
My own business
(beat)
Thanks for the light Okay
The Englishman sits down beside her but doesnt look
at
her
Tracy looks away too determined to ignore him not to
let
him get into her space
Duncan coughs After a long moment he turns back to
her

DUNCAN
Next rounds on me
Tracy keeps her eyes straight ahead acknowledging
nothing

Pause

Duncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on
the
bar staring at her Tracy turns to him

TRACY
(annoyed)
Listen mister Ive got my own money
So if you dont mind

She looks away again Pause

DUNCAN
After what I been through I dont
mind anything

Longer pause

DUNCAN
See thats the whole point My
mind Your mind Where do they
fit in You know what I mean

Tracy abruptly picks up her purse and moves down the
bar
away from him one seat then another seat

ANGLE ON ELDERLY COUPLE

They are watching this little spectacle with growing
curiosity

DUNCAN

Looking up at Bill his eyes red his gaze unsteady

The bartender steps back deciding to mind his own
Tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even
down the bar
BILL
(to Duncan)
Go on beat it

They glare at each other The longer Duncan sits there
moving without saying anything the angrier Bill gets
REACTION SHOTS
As the tension builds
ANGLE ON BAR
Duncan looks away

BILL
Im not going to say it again mister

Duncan reaches for his drink but Bill reacts quicker
a swipe of his hand he knocks the glass off the bar
shatters on the floor behind the bar

Duncan sits there stunned not looking up After a
moment Duncan coughs Then he turns and looks at Bill
purses his lips It looks like a nervous facial

Then suddenly Duncan spits at Bill hitting him square

Before anyone can register whats happened Bill lunges
Duncan knocking him clean off the barstool and onto
floor

The fight is fast vicious and one-sided from the very

Pinned to the floor on his back Duncan flails his arms
ineffectually like a panicked insect as Bill holds him

place with a left-handed grip on the collar while his
right arm pumping up and down like a piston pounds

Duncans face time and time again

Duncans screams diminish into pathetic sickening

and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their
from this brutal spectacle

Hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is
a number He turns away from the fight to talk

Then as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan he
to his feet and turns to the bar He reaches over and
the phone from Hank slamming it down into the cradle

BILL
Whore you calling

Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes
face off He snaps his fingers and points to a row of
on a shelf behind the bar Hank quickly hands him a
Bill pours himself a shot and downs it fast He is
charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in

succession spilling the alcohol on the bar and on

As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again
stands up and quickly walks out of the bar slamming

the
door behind her
BILL
(calling after her)
Youre welcome baby
Then he throws down the cloth picks up the bottle
turns
and standing over Duncans inert form empties half
the
bottle onto him He sets the bottle back on the bar He
grabs
Duncan and half dragging hurries him out the back
door and
throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap
Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself
another
drink
BILL

Okay
Hank just looks at him doesnt answer At the wifes

Good riddance to bad rubbish eh

Bill doesnt answer and the couple quietly leave

A series of shots of Tracy walking home The CAMERA
consistently behind her or off to one side sometimes
with her behind a row of parked cars sometimes picking
her passing reflection in a darkened store window

The impression this gives is unmistakable Curt Duncan
following her We do not see him we do not hear him
know he is there Often we can sense that the very

from which we see Tracy is his POV

But Tracy is aware of nothing We know this when the

begins to move in front of her once more becoming an
impersonal observer of her walk homeward to safety

Tension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will
out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she

CLIFFORD

Hes escaped from the insane asylum
In 1972 he murdered two children
broke into a house and found them
asleep in bed It was a little boy
five an a half and a little three-
year-old girl After the coroners
investigation their bodies were
taken to the mortuary where the
undertaker took one look at them and
said he couldnt have their bodies
reconstructed for the funeral without
six days of steady work Then he
asked what had been the murder weapon
because looking at the mess in front
of him he couldnt imagine what had
been used The coroner told him there
had been no murder weapon The killer
had used only his hands

(beat)
The undertaker went to work and had
them done in four

to
the point of nausea

We go for a TIGHT SHOT of the boy on top of the bed

chit-chit noises grow steadily louder as the boys
apprehension turns to fear then to terror The boy

to whimper

Suddenly we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room The

The boy continues sobbing moving about in little
Duncan amazed at what he sees slowly crawls out from
wall on his hands and knees crawls toward the weeping
staring at it with a strange look on his face
Suddenly the boy stops crying and looks at Duncan
hesitantly They are less than a foot apart almost
face Together they form a kind of frozen tableau
close to sympathy crosses the killers expression and
boy likewise achieves a faint sense of recognition
Then just as suddenly the boy starts wailing again
runs off down the alleyway Duncan watches him

Then he slowly pulls himself to his feet
