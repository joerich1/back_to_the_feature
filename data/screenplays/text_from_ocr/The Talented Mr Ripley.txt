ridiculous his skin alabaster against the brown bodies

and dashes to the water where he luxuriates in the coolness
of it before wading out of the sea and walking straight up
to Dickie

crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
book and I was always going to this cafe
with Jean-Jacques and Dickie used to
play his saxophone outside and I would
see him and he would see me and he would
play My Funny Valentine It was only
later that I realised he only knows about
six songs

Theyve arrived at the Grocery Store Alessandra the woman
who owns the store greets them Silvana whos her daughter
is also there and less comfortable She waits for Marges
order

MARGE (contd)
(to Silvana in Italian)
Buono Sera Silvana Por favore arance e
pane e del prosciutto

Si Come sempre Grazie

Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread Marge frowns

Valentine and then all of a sudden he
just walks into the cafe right in front
of Jean-Jacques and grabs me Now I had
never spoken to him in my life - he said
Im going to Italy tomorrow and I want
you to come with me So I did

At the edge of the square theres A BOCCE AREA where men
throw metal balls along a track aiming to get closest to a
small cue Dickie is there playing intensely with Fausto and
two other guys one of whom weve seen before with Silvana

he can also look down into the cabin its porthole offering
him a restricted view He looks down and theres a flash of
flesh then nothing Then as the boat swings with the waves
he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair and then
Marges bare foot kicking out rhythmically the red-painted
toes straining Ripleys mesmerized aroused and absolutely
betrayed

EXT MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY LATE DAY
A WOMANS HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water

Its a statue of the Virgin Mary life size adorned with
flowers and a lace veil As she is revealed wooden
staring four men emerge lifting the statue on a palette
wading towards the shore the Madonna aloft on their
shoulders

The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
Festival of the Madonna del Mare either standing in their
fishing boats or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
altar boys and incense RIPLEY DICKIE and MARGE watch from
Dickies terrace There are hymns and as the statue is
carried to the shore the mens heads barely above the waves
the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
walking on water

Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water
about fifty yards from the statue Theres a scream from
among the crowd as someone notices the body Its SILVANA
One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse
Its Silvanas fiancee and in a second he has let go of the
palette CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE and - in absolute grief -
wades swims splashes towards the body

PANDEMONIUM in the crowd which breaks up with other people
splashing fully clothed into the water From the terrace
Ripley turns and looks at Dickie catching his eye

EXT DICKIES TERRACE LATE DAY

Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below

brother They are pulled apart Then the ambulance pulls

in bringing Dickie home Naturally I
hope the trip has afforded you some
pleasure despite the failure of its main
objective you need no longer consider

Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
reflection of the train window so that he can move his head

Took a boat out round the bay The first
place I liked I got it

The motor boat is ploughing the waves Dickie exhilarated by
the speed
RIPLEY
Dickie slow down come on

Ripley grips the oar his knuckles white Dickie cuts the
motor and the boat slows to a crawl miles from the shore

DICKIE
(ecstatic)
I love it here Gonna live here

Dickie takes off his jacket then drums against the edge of
the boat developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers
already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich

RIPLEY
I wanted to tell you my plan

DICKIE
So tell me

RIPLEY
I thought I might come back In the New
Year Under my own steam

DICKIE
(suddenly tight)
Really To Italy

RIPLEY
Of course Lets say for arguments
sake you were here - perhaps we could
split the rent on a house - Ill get a
job - or better still I could get a
place in Rome and when were there we
could be there and if were here we could
be here -

DICKIE
Oh God I dont think so

RIPLEY

problem you can just blame me

Ripley stares at him his eyes suddenly reptilian

RIPLEY

(volcanic)
The funny thing - Im not pretending to

played chess for instance it was
obvious -

DICKIE
(incredulous )
What evening

RIPLEY
Sure - I know thats too dangerous for
you fair enough hey were brothers

Marge fucking her on the boat while we
all have to listen which was
excruciating frankly plus you follow
your cock around like a - and now youre
getting married Im bewildered forgive
meyoure lying to Marge then getting
married to her youre knocking up
Silvana youve got to play sax youve
got to play drums which is it Dickie
what do you really play

Dickie furious gets up and lurches towards Ripley

DICKIE
(attacking him administering
tiny slaps as punctuation to
his tirade)
Who are you - some imposter some third
class mooch - who are you to tell me
anything Actually I really really
really dont want to be on this boat with
you I cant move without you moving
which is exactly how it feels and it
gives me the creeps

(he goes to rev up the engine)

I cant move without - Dickie Dickie

RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR DICKIE SLIPS
OFF THE WOODEN SEAT HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE

RIPLEY
Shut up Just shut up Just shut up

The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller Dickie looks
up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back

DICKIE
For Gods sake

Ripley shocked at himself goes to Dickie rocking the boat
catches him up then is horrified to see Dickies face
apparently unmarked SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN a line of blood and
then a peeling like a fruit bursting Ripleys appalled A
terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
Ripley

DICKIE (contd)
I1l1 kill you

Ripley finds himself pushing him away picking up the oar
kicking off Dickies hand around his ankle The boat is
rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
tiller Ripley almost loses his balance His glasses come
off They struggle locked together in a life or death
wrestle to get control of the oar Dickies blinded by his
own blood loses his grip

Ripley terrified hits Dickie again and again the oar like
a carpet-beater banging down flat blood on the blade blood
on Ripley until hes on his knees heaving for breath
letting his arm drop then realizing disgusted that hes
let it rest in a pool of blood He starts to sob sprawls
there sobbing next to Dickie horrified by what hes done

Nobodys in sight The boat rocks gently the sun sparkling
indifferently on the waves Ripley lies by Dickie in the
bottom of the boat in the embrace hes always wanted

The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully The sea
calms

EXT A COVE NEAR SAN REMO AFTERNOON

A deserted cove several miles along the coast Ripley
clambers onto a rock over the shore Hes watching the boat
slowly sinking Shuddering from the exertion the cold he
finds Dickies jacket puts it on and watches as the boat
disappears under the surface

RIPLEY
A few days ago

No Here is a pattern Two days ago
Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
apartment and is murdered Yesterday a
little boat is found in San Remo full of
rocks and the owner tells the Police it
was stolen on November 7th We look at
hotel records and we see oh Dickie
Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
our boatman remembers two Americans
taking a boat

Its not a pattern its a coincidence
There must be fifty hotels in San Remo
there must have been a hundred people
renting a boat on that day

Roverini nods mutters to Baggio who heads out

RIPLEY (contd)
Thank you

ROVERINI
(watching him)
May I askwhy would you speak to your
friend and not your fiance

some business for me nor does Mr Ripley
want to marry me Nor did he ask me
every day if I would marry him And when

ROVERINI
Do you have a photograph of Signor
Ripley

RIPLEY

Im not in the habit of carrying around
photographs of my male friends

ROVERINI

ROVERINI
Sorry No-one has seen Signor Ripley
since San -

RIPLEY
I have

ROVERINI
You have yes

RIPLEY

No I have and so has Miss Sherwood ask
her and if I could remember which hotel
he was staying at - the Goldoni - Tom

stairs

ROVERINI (0S)

wont count any more On you I wont
count on you any more Whatever it is

youve broken my heart Thats one thing
I know youre guilty of and I dont know

they ring out on the stone stairs The tapping sound resolves
into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter

Hes finished the letter signs it puts it in an envelope
marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano

as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf

during which Peter translates

VERRECCHIA

seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
noto non e riuscito a impedire il
verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
Greenleaf il quale era lunica persona
al momento passibile di incriminazione
del reato di omicidio del signor Miles

omosessuali

PETER

By the way officially there are no
Italian homosexuals Makes Leonardo
Michelangelo very inconvenient

RIPLEY
Tell him I have a fiance Dickie has a
fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a
string of them

PETER
(translating)
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata il
signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e

Mamma mia quante fidanzate

They all laugh

RIPLEY
What did he say

PETER
He says so many fiances

VERRECCHIA
(suddenly very tough)
Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
Dickie Greenleaf Vero

As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently

PETER
He wants to know if you killed Freddie
Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf

RIPLEY
(outraged)
No I did not I did not kill Freddie
Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf Is
he accusing me
(Peter clearly doesnt ask)
Ask him if hes accusing me

PETER
Hes already angry I dont think -

RIPLEY
(interrupting heated)
Just because he doesnt like Americans

already read this suicide note

Theres music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING Peter is an
opera repetiteur Ripley is sitting at Peters piano playing
from the score of Vivaldis Stabat Mater Peters made supper
Hes setting the table

PETER
Can you imagine if Dickie did kill
Freddie what must that be like To wake
up every morning how can you Just wake
up and be a person drink a coffee

RIPLEY
Whatever you do however terrible
however hurtful - it all makes sense
doesnt it inside your head You never
meet anybody who thinks theyre a bad
person or that theyre cruel

PETER
But youre still tormented you must be
youve killed somebody

RIPLEY
Dont you put the past in a room in the
cellar and lock the door and just never
go in there Because thats what I do

PETER
Probably In my case its probably a
whole building

RIPLEY
Then you meet someone special and all you
want to do is toss them the key say open
up step inside but you cant because
its dark and there are demons and if
anybody saw how ugly it was

Peters come over stands behind him over the piano

PETER
Thats the music talking Harder to be
bleak if youre playing Knees up Mother
Brown

He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripleys shoulder

RIPLEY
I keep wanting to do that - fling open

great friend to my son Everything is

INT RIPLEYS SITTING ROOM VENICE NIGHT

Marge is leaving coat on as Ripley comes out of the
bathroom

RIPLEY
Marge Where are you going

MARGE
(like a creature caught in
headlights)
I was looking for a needle and thread I
wasnt snooping I was looking for a
needle and thread to mend my bra

RIPLEY
The scent youre wearing I bought it for
you not Dickie The thing about Dickie
So many things The day he was late back
from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
was with another girl Im not talking
about Meredith another girl we met in a
bar He couldnt be faithful for five
minutes So when he makes a promise it
doesnt mean what it means when you make
a promise Or I do He has so many
realities Dickie and he believes them
all He lies He lies thats his half
the time he doesnt even realize

A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe As
he speaks the stain spreads He looks at it absently

RIPLEY (contd)
Today for the first time Ive even
wondered whether he might have killed
Freddie He would get so crazy if anybody
contradicted him - well you know that
Marge I loved you - you might as well
know - I loved you and because he knew I
loved you he let you think I loved him
Didnt you see couldnt you see I dont
know maybe its grotesque to say this
now so just write it on a piece of paper
or something and keep it in your purse
for a rainy day Tom loves me

MARGE
(as if shed heard nothing)
Why do you have Dickies rings

His hand goes to his pocket HES GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT

RIPLEY
I told you He gave them to me

MARGE
I dont believe a single word youve

said
Marge is shivering Ripley ominous advances she retreats

RIPLEY
Youre shivering Marge Can I hold you
Would you let me hold you

Marge panics backed up against the door She screams and
turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER whos come
back to visit Ripley and is unlocking the door

MARGE
(sobbing uncontrollably)
Oh Peter Get me out of here

Ripley storms off His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
IN BLOOD from the razor Peter notices appalled

PETER

INT HERBERT GREENLEAFS SUITE EUROPA REGINA DAY

Ripley knocks on the door Its opened by a face he doesnt
recognize A middle-aged heavy set man Its MacCARRON the
private investigator
RIPLEY
Is Mr Greenleaf here

MACCARRON
Mr Ripley Im Alvin MacCarron

MARGE (0S)
I dont know I dont know I just know
it

HERBERT GREENLEAF
(0S)
Marge theres female intuition and
then there are facts -

Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge her hair pulled back
as if newly-widowed THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
TABLE

HERBERT GREENLEAF
Tom

RIPLEY
Hello sir
(smiles thinly at Marge)
Marge you should have waited didnt
Peter tell you Id come by and pick you
up

HERBERT GREENLEAF
Marge has been telling us about the
rings

RIPLEY
You know I feel ridiculous I didnt
mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
ridiculous

HERBERT GREENLEAF
Perhaps you didnt mention them because
theres only one conclusion to be drawn

Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
heads into his bedroom

HERBERT GREENLEAF
(contd)
Im going to take Marge for a little
walk Tom Mr MacCarron wants to talk
with you

RIPLEY
(feeling caged in)
We could go down to the bar - no need for
you to -

HERBERT GREENLEAF
No he should talk to you alone

He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out RIPLEY IS
PARALYSED He waits for the door to shut Aimlessly he walks
out onto the terrace with its staggering beautiful and
indifferent view
EXT EUROPA REGINA THE GREENLEAF TERRACE DAY
Ripley stands steels himself for MacCarrons charges

RIPLEY
I could probably see my bedroom from
here I can see my house When you see
where you live from a distance its like
a dream isnt it

MACCARRON
(coming out)
I dont care for BS I dont care to
hear it I dont care to speak it

RIPLEY
Okay

MACCARRON
Why do you think Dickies father sent him
to Europe in the first place Did you
know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
killed a boy

Ripley turns shocked

MACCARRON

(contd)
At a party Over some girl He kicked the
kid several times in the head Put him in
the hospital The boy had a wire fixed in
his jaw The Rome Police didnt think to
ask Mr Greenleaf

MacCarron gets up

MACCARRON

(contd)
Nor did they think to check whether a
Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
Princeton University I turned up a Tom
Ripley whod been a piano tuner in the
music department

Ripleys head drops

MACCARRON

(contd)
See - in America were taught to check a
fact before it becomes a fact Were
taught to nose around when a girl drowns
herself find out if that girl was
pregnant find out if Dickie had an
embarrassment there

Ripley doesnt know where this barrage is going

MACCARRON

(contd)
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty
He really does Marge shes got a
hundred theories but there are a few
things she doesnt know We hope she
never knows

RIPLEY
I hope she never knows

MACCARRON
Three different people saw Dickie get
into Freddie Miles car A man who wont
identify himself because he was jumping
someone elses wife at the time saw
Dickie removing license plates from a red
sports car The Police know about this
man because he happens to be a Policeman

He walks out of the room returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
from Freddies car

MACCARRON

(contd)
I found these in the basement of Dickies
apartment They belonged to Freddies
car Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
them in the canal this evening

Ripley cant believe what hes hearing Its like a dream

MACCARRON

(contd)
Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
silent promise in Dickies letter to you
which he intends to honor He intends to
transfer a good part of Dickies income
from his trust into your name He doesnt
intend to give the Italian police any
information about Dickies past Hes
rather hoping youll feel the same

There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed
EXT EUROPA REGINA MOORING DAY

Ripley stands with Marge Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
waters edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling They shake hands and
then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch Herbert
Greenleaf carries the saxophone case

RIPLEY
(to Marge)
I feel I never should have said those
things to you the other evening I was
pretty flustered the rings and - and you
looked so I dont know

Marge shakes her head to silence him

RIPLEY (contd)
But I hope that note goes to New York in
your purse for a rainy day

MARGE
What are you going to do now Tom
RIPLEY
I dont know Peter has a concert in
Athens next month - and hes asked if I
want to go along help out He says
goodbye by the way - hes in rehearsal
otherwise -

MARGE
Why do I think theres never been a
Ripley rainy day

RIPLEY
What

MARGE
(lunging at him)
I know it was you - I know it was you
Tom I know it was you I know you killed
Dickie I know it was you

RIPLEY
Oh Marge

He puts his hand out to control her She pushes it away
STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM the frustration too much so that
Ripley has to cover his face MacCarron comes off the boat to
restrain her Ripley looks at him as if to say what can you
do shes hysterical MacCarron nods pulls her on to the
boat Greenleaf catches Ripleys eye guiltily Turns away
They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
towards open waters passing the little fleets of gondolas

THE END

Lullaby for Cain

From the silence
from the night
comes a distant lullabye

Cry remembering that first cry
Your brother standing by

and loved

both loved

beloved sons of mine
sing a lullabye
mother is close by
innocent eyes

such innocent eyes

Envy stole your brothers life
came home murdered peace of mind
left you nightmares on the pillow
sleep now

Soul surrendering your soul
the heart of you not whole
for love

but love

what toll

Cast into the dark
branded with the mark
of shame

of Cain

From the garden of Gods light
to a wilderness of light
sleep now

sleep now
