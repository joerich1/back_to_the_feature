IN THE BEGINNING 1

BLACK an infinite void but at the center a SINGULARITY a
particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains
all the potential matter and energy in the universe

THE BIG BANG

A blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes
particles expanding in all directions until they fill the
screen a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust

Then the particles start to attract one another to form
atoms the atoms elements the elements form molecules the
molecules compounds the compounds cells then a cell
twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts booming out a Dolby
heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms
Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by

a

much bigger fish and we rapidly rise from the depths and

pull back to reveal--

THE SEA 2

Vast blue rolling toward the shore brilliant sun rising
in

a cloudless azure sky

A WOMAN emerges from the sea like Aphrodite strongly
backlit

to obscure her nudity but we can see she is full-breasted
long-limbed toned and tanned-- perfection Then a MAN rises
up out of the water beside her and staggers clumsily in the
surf Even in silhouette we can see hes far from perfect--
short overweight They turn to each other and embrace

Its paradise-- for him
there

THE WOMAN
(looking deep in his eyes)
Im so hungry

THE MAN

(wanting her)

Yeah Me too

The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to
kiss her but she turns and walks away

WOMAN
What should we eat

THE MAN
Oh you actually meant you were
hungry I thought-- forget it

Official White

He follows her

They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach When they
reach the line of vegetation the woman MAYA kneels pulls
berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth

The man ZED grabs a handful of berries and they squat

noshing like Adam and Eve

THE WOMAN
Mmmm these are so good

THE MAN

Mmrrunm they really are

When she turns away he spits them out in disgust

Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his their lips
almost touching

MAYA
(very sexy)

thought you might be curious why we

the kind of man whos willing to
take a chance and start thinking
for himself but I guess I was

Ww

not Paradise anymore Then like every man that ever lived
and will ever live he caves
him

(contd)

(contd)

Official White

ZED

Okay Fine You want to try the

Good and Evil fruit you got it

He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands
her one They both stare at the fruit

MAYA

ZED
No way It was your idea You go
first

MAYA
We both bite at the same time
Zed considers for a long moment then decides

ZED
Okay Ready One-- two-- three
Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite but Maya fakes

out and stops before her teeth break the skin
ZED

(with his mouth full)

Got me Thats a good move Im

going to steal it

He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste
of Good and Evil Then his face contorts in disgust and he
spits it out

ZED

(gagging and spitting)

Yuchh Thats horrible Yecch

ptui Ughh

He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his
fingers trying to get the terrible taste out

MAYA
So youre saying its not good

ZED
(contd)

Yes Im saying its not good

He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp Then a
loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up

ZED

Oh no--

Official White
He runs for the bushes Mayas attention gets diverted

MAYA

(noticing something)
Ooh banana

CUT TO

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

CO

signs

A TRIBE OF PRIMITIVE CAUCASIANS Dozens of huts surround a
mmunal fire pit where WOMEN in loincloths roll flatbread

and cook it on heated rocks The drums start pounding out a
celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR
on a pole their faces marked with boars blood ritual

in honor of the kill

The lead hunter MARLAK is a hulking thug with a bony
Neanderthal forehead He cuts off the boars head and drops
it at Mayas feet

MARLAK
(blunt grunt)
For you

MAYA
(forces a grateful smile)
Thank you Marlak

ZEDS HUT

Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut
his guts still aching His best friend OH sits next to him
sewing skins together watching the hunters with envy
jealous of the attention theyre getting from the women

If Zed is over-confident and reckless Oh is his polar
opposite nervous and risk-averse the kind of guy who would
apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear He
may in fact be near-sighted and if glasses had been
invented hed be wearing them

OH

(GRUMBLING)

Look at them Hunters think
theyre so cool They dont think
gathering is dangerous There are
thorns-- bees-- those big stingy
ants I could hunt-- I just dont
want to And whats with the blood
on their faces They think thats
sanitary

Official White

ZED
(miserable with pain)
Do me a favor Just kill me

OH
Why did you eat that fruit Its
forbidden Everybody knows that

ZED

I couldnt help myself Maya was
just staring at me with those pouty
eyes-- and those perky breasts--
opposable thumbs And how about

the name The Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil You
dont think that sounds tempting
They shouldve just called it The
Tree with the Fruit that Tastes

Like Shit Then for sure nobody

would eat it

Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind
his dwelling

ZED
(contd)
(shouts testily)
Hey Squanto Give me a break
would ya You got the whole
forest
(to Oh)
Why does everyone have to crap
right behind my hut
OH
I think and I could be wrong that
all the poop makes the ground more
fertile which in turn gives the
leaves in the area a softer feel
Its a vicious circle
Oh notices a very pretty young woman EEMA standing near
the
communal fire with TWO HUNTERS His heart leaps
OH
(contd)
(calls out eagerly)
Hi Eema
Eema turns sees its him and gives him a perfunctory wave
then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh
that makes them laugh
Official White

OH
(contd)

She doesnt even know I exist

(LOVE-STRUCK)
I want to lay with her so badly

ZED
I dont see it I mean shes cute
but I dont think Id lay with her
OH

Of course not Shes your sister
Itd be like sleeping with your
mother

ZED

which was a big mistake I see

that now You think it wont be
awkward the next morning but--
trust me you just want to rip your
eyeballs out

(shakes off the memory)

Listen if you want to impress
Eema tonight at the feast do the
fertility dance with her then drag
her back to your hut

OH
My huts a mess And what if she
struggles

ZED
So you give her a little tap on the
head Women respond to that--

OH

(SIGHS)

No She only likes hunters-- not

gatherers

They look over at Eema who is now slowly stroking the shaft
of a hunters spear

ZED
I wouldnt read too much into that
She kisses then tongues the spear tip
ZED
(contd)
Okay that might mean something
The hunter Marlak walks by and stops Hes clearly half a
rung lower on the human evolutionary scale

Official White
MARLAK
You didnt hunt today

ZED

Yes Marlak Very observant I

was indisposed Got that

intestinal thing thats been going

around

Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on
the

walls of Zeds hut

MARLAK
(points at a drawing)
Whats that supposed to be

ZED
Its a bear

MARLAK
Thats not a bear Thats just
some lines on a skin

ZED

(SIGHS)

Its not a real bear Its a
representation of a bear You
know a picture

MARLAK
Thats stupid

ZED
Yeah Like youd know

MARLAK

And whats that

He picks up a skin with another of Zeds drawings on it
this

one of a big-breasted naked girl Zed quickly grabs it and

holds it upside down

ZED
That-- would be an antelope-- or a
deer-- a deerpalope

MARLAK
(trying to look at it
upside down)

It looks like Maya
Official White

ZED

(hides it away)

How could it be Maya Its just
some lines on a skin

MARLAK
Stay away from my woman

ZED

Your woman Im not sure dragging

her into the bushes kicking and

screaming means you have an actual

thing going

Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head

MARLAK
(walking off)
Stay away

ZED

(calls after him)

Hey Nice supra-orbital ridge
fartface

DISSOLVE TO

A ROARING FIRE
The DRUMS kick up another notch as the huge boar roasts on a
spit over a roaring fire

EXT VILLAGE - NIGHT

The tribe is gathered around the big fire pit The tribes
SHAMAN their medicine man and spirit leader dances around
the fire in a boars head mask accessorized with way too
many bones beads and feathers

Zed and Oh are sitting near the fire smoking something in a
long decorated pipe
ZED

Hey Oh Did it ever occur to you
that there may be more to life than
this

OH

(taking the pipe from Zed)
Okay I think somebodys had
enough

Official White

ZED
No

thisworld we hunt we gather we

ZED

Oh takes a big toke on the pipe chokes and starts coughing
uncontrollably

ZED

No Last night I couldnt sleep
so I just laid there looking up at
the sky counting the stars There
were over seventy Kinda makes you
think doesnt it

OH
(looks up at the sky)
No

ZED
Really Ive been thinking about
it ever since I ate that fruit

Dont you ever wonder whats on the
other side of the mountains

OH

Theres nothing on the other side
of the mountains Everybody knows
that The world just ends Youd
fall right off the edge

(makes a sharp gesture)

ZED

But what if it doesnt What if it
just goes on and on forever Or
what if its round

(he picks up a round

ROCK) )

And if you keep walking you

eventually come right back to where

you started

He traces the circumference with his finger

Official White

OH

(SCOFFS)
Oh yeah thats plausible
Zed flings the rock away

A VILLAGER (0C)
Oww

ZED

(tries to cheer him up

Will you stop with that crazy talk

Oh looks over at Eema Zed picks up on it

ZED
Do it man Go dance for her

OH

Jackal Dance I dont do that one
so well

ZED

Are you kidding Go Jackal

Dance

Oh summons his courage gets up and crosses to where the
girls are sitting
Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya waggles his eyebrows
and licks his lips She laughs and looks away
Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema subtly
jerking his pelvis trying to be cool
Eema just stares at him for a moment then goes back to
talking to her friends Oh looks over at Zed for help
Zed mimes clonking her on the head
Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin
However instead of submitting she gets really pissed
stands up and decks him with one punch

Official White

Eema glowers at Zed who feigns innocence

Cut TO

THE FIRE PIT - MINUTES LATER
A hunter is slicing off hunks of boar meat for the other
tribesmen Zed pushes through the small crowd waiting for
food and goes to the front

ZED
Excuse me hunter coming through

VILLAGERS
Hey Wait your turn Theres a
yee

it

line here buddy

ZED

For your information I was in line

and I just stepped out to chew some

food for an elderly lady

Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face stopping
him Its Marlak who towers over Zed His cohort
ENMEBARAGESI short and stout stands beside him

MARLAK
Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the
garden with Maya

ZED
Oh really And what if I called
Enmebaragesi a liar

ENMEBARAGESI
Id kill you

ZED
Calm down I said what

was a hypothetical
Marlak gets right in Zeds face

MARLAK

Enmebaragesi doesnt lie

Villagers gather around them Maya and Eema among them
Marlak puts his spear point to Zeds throat

MARLAK (contd)

The truth

Official White

MAYA
Zed just admit it Youre just
making it harder on yourself

ZED

(instantly annoyed)

No you just made it harder on
myself
(to Marlak)
Okay fine you got me
(gingerly moves the spear

POINT)

Maya and I lay together on

occasion Were consenting adults

and we have an adventurous sexual

relationship

Maya looks shocked and tries to signal Zed to shut up

MARLAK

(STUNNED)
You laid with my woman

ZED

Isnt that what were talking
about

Maya rolls her eyes

ENMEBARAGESI
No I saw you eat the Forbidden
Fruit

ZED

Oh that Yeah I did eat the

fruit I was just kidding about

humping Maya

Marlak knocks Zed to the ground The DRUMMING stops
Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed

OH

(FORCEFUL)
Hey Whats going on
Marlak growls at him
OH
(contd)
(quickly looks up at the

SKY)
Oooh shooting star
Official White

Zed gets to his feet
ZED
Look Marlak this is crazy
Youre two of me Im not gonna
fight you over a girl okay
Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD
HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it and it hits an
unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose
Zed
(contd)

(to Enmebaragesi)

And let that be a lesson to your

big friend-

Marlak grabs Zed lands two solid punches to Zeds mid-
section and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends
him sprawling to the ground

MARLAK

(standing over Zed)

Your father was a great hunter but
youre like-- a girl

The hunters laugh

ENMEBARAGESI
Good one Marlak

ANOTHER HUNTER
Zing

MARLAK

Now I kill you

Hes about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and
jumps between them The villagers step back as the Shaman
howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed

SHAMAN
(leaning close to Zed)
We need to talk

Cut TO

THE CAMPFIRE - MINUTES LATER 7
Zed and the Shaman sit side by side on a log talking
privately

Official White

The Shaman is covered in skins feathers bones beads
animal teeth antlers and horns his hair a mass of long
muddy dreadlocks his face painted his cheeks nose and
ears pierced by shards of bone But if not for his
outlandish getup zed could be talking to his pastor

SHAMAN
You really ate the fruit

ZED
One bite Whats the big deal

SHAMAN
(halfheartedly shakes a
chicken-foot rattle at

HIM)

You dont eat the fruit Thats
been the number one rule from the
beginning of time Since the Great
Turtle climbed from the sea with
the Earth on his back drank the
ocean pooped out the mountains and
the first man fell from the stars

ZED

Ive always had trouble with the
Great Turtle Theory-- too many
unexplained gaps

SHAMAN
Whatever Youre screwed now

ZED

Really How screwed Like I knew
it was a rule but Ima little
fuzzy on the exact details

SHAMAN

Youre cursed man and if you stay
here then well all be cursed You
have to leave

ZED
Where am I supposed to go
SHAMAN
Up to you From now on youre
completely on your own

ZED

(DEFIANT)
Oh really

(MORE )

Official White 17
ZED

(contd)
Am I detecting a little jealousy

here because I now have the

nowledge of good and evil and you

dont Well you know what I say

what I did was a good thing-- a

very very good thing-- and Im not

leaving What do you think of

that

A HUMAN SKULL comes flying in from off-camera and lands at
his feet

ZED

(contd)
Okay is that supposed to be funny
He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing
around them in a wide circle
Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide
shield
starting a rhythmical beat The other hunters join in
keeping the beat staring at Zed with lethal intent

SHAMAN
(to Zed re the hunters)
You should probably get going now
You better take this knife
He hands him a flint knife with a leather-wrapped handle
SHAMAN
(contd)
And some of the guys got together
and they want you to have this bow
He hands him a strong hunters bow

Zed

(contd)

ZED

I dont want to seem ungrateful or
anything but you wouldnt happen
to have any arrows would you

An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head

SHAMAN

(to Zed)

Youd better get moving

Zed looks around at his fellow villagers
what dignity he has left

ZED

(DEFIANT)

Okay but before I go I just want
to say something I know Im not
the greatest hunter--

Official White

VILLAGER (0S)
--Or gatherer--

ZED

Yes or gatherer-- but theres got
to be more to life than this--

(to Hunters)

Kinda hard to concentrate with that
rhythmic drumming fellas

trying to summon

The Hunters keep the insistent beat their gaze fixed on

ZED

(rolls his eyes these

guys are hopeless)

Anyways Im going away not
because youre forcing me to--
which you are-- but because I
choose to Yes I ate from the

Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
Evil-- major misunderstanding on my
part-- and believe me Im not
(contd)

(contd)

(contd)

recommending it unless youre

interested in a very powerful

laxative-- but it got me thinking

about some pretty heavy stuff --

life questions you know So Im

out of here and anyone who wants

to join me is welcome

He looks around the circle and sees Maya She sees Marlak
staring at her and averts her eyes

ZED

ANYONE--

Zed looks at oh who suddenly becomes very interested in an
imaginary piece of loincloth lint

ZED

(looks directly at Oh)

dont know where were going or
when were going to get there but
will lead the way--

(he picks up a burning

TORCH)

lighting up the darkness-- pointing

us in the right direction and

eeping us entertained with

humorous anecdotes from my

childhood Now whos with me

He enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air

Official White

Oh looks at Eema then at Zed and lowers his eyes
ZED

Okay then I guess Ill just have
to go it alone which is fine with

ME--

(to Oh)

--better in fact because having a

partner would just slow me down

Oh cant look at him

Zed shakes his head failing to notice that the torch hes
holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him

The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof
ZED
(contd)
Oops
They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof
ZED
(contd)
know theres a lesson in here
somewhere Any thoughts
The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts
ts chaos
MARLAK
(raises his spear to Zed)
Now you die
Marlak throws his spear and misses as Zed takes off running
into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the
whole village ablaze
CUT TO

EXT FOREST - NIGHT 8
Zed runs for his life through the dense forest
The hunters chase him shooting arrows at him on a dead run
Zed dodges as the arrows zip around him He veers left then
right then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment
The hunters stop at the top of the embankment Marlak
listens for sounds of movement in the forest below then
silently signals for the hunters to fan out
Official White

Marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment reaches the
bottom and sees something in the moonlight

Its Zed lying on the ground badly camouflaged with sticks
and leaves thinking he cant be seen but the shape of his
body is clearly discernible Marlak raises his spear

MARLAK
I see you

ZED

(long beat)
No you dont

MARLAK
Yes I do
ZED

How can you see me if Im not here

MARLAK
Youre trying to trick me

ZED
Okay then tell me this-- whos
standing right behind you

MARLAK

(nobodys fool)

You think Im going to turn around

and look but Im not

(pulls his knife)

Im going to gut you like a pig

He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is
struck from behind by a heavy tree branch He falls heavily
knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the
makeshift club

Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh

OH
I guess Im with you

ZED
Was it my speech

OH
No the fire I lost everything

Official White

ZED

But the speech was pretty good
right I mean even I was moved
and I was the one speaking

woods

ZED

ZED

(SCOFFS)

Yeah like its so hard to build a
new hut Its just a pile of
sticks and dung--

OH

(SCOWLS)
Youre a pile of sticks and dung

Suddenly Zed stops and stands perfectly still

ZED
(through clenched teeth)
Oh

OH

Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head Oh looks up

A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them
Oh freezes They talk like ventriloquists

ZED
Dont move a muscle

ZED

(without moving his lips)

I dont know Theres two

EXT A FIRE - DAYBREAK 10

Zed is holding a stick over the fire cooking what looks
like

a squirrel or a muskrat

Oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks
and branches One of Ohs sticks falls and as he carefully
reaches down to grab it the rest spill out on the ground
Oh sighs His body is covered with long claw marks

ZED

You really should put some maggots
on those scratches They look
pretty deep

OH

(BITTER)

not to move and you ran

ZED

Because I honestly thought hed go

OH

ZED

come
OH
Yes you did You looked right at
me-- twice

ZED

Yes thats a technique of public
speaking but I didnt ask you
specifically You chose to come
You gotta take some responsibility
for that And theres no point

whining about every little-- cougar
that attacks you

(pulls the cooked rodent

from the fire)

You want some or not

Official White

OH

(HUFFY)

it

He turns his back to Zed and starts sorting through the
pile

of sticks

ZED

forest now thinning to evergreens and mountain heather

Cut TO

THE MOUNTAINS - LATER 12

Zed and Oh climbing higher now Finally they reach the top
and look out at the vista

From their vantage point they can see a high plateau and
wooded land stretching far beyond it

ZED

(GLOATING)

I knew it Still think youre just
gonna fall off the edge of the
world

Official White

OH

(in amazement)

Incredible

He takes a step forward the rock shelf gives way beneath

feet and he falls a great distance screaming all the way
down bouncing painfully off the big boulders then a long
tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom

ZED

(WINCES)
Oooh

(then calls out)
Ill go around Wait for me
CUT TO

EXT FOREST - LATER 13

Zed is following a trail downhill through the forest on the
other side of the mountains Oh is limping along behind him
bitten clawed cut scraped and bruised

ZED

Say what you want but that was no
accident You dont see a pattern
here

OH

I see a pattern Every time
something terrible can happen to

ZED

You think Theres about a
thousand footprints here
Official White

He indicates the heavily trampled forest floor

They stopped here to poop Look

OH
No thank you

ZED
Four men maybe five And a child--

Okay

ZED

(poking at the evidence)

Looks like they had some nuts--—
dried fruit-- some kind of green
leafy vegetable--

OH
Okay Enough Can we just go
Maybe we can find where they peed

Then Zed sees light through the trees and creeps 14
stealthily to the tree line Oh creeps up beside him and
they peer through the bushes
THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture Beyond it well-
tended fields of growing grain
Zed snaps into stalking mode ducks down and silently
signals
Oh to be quiet and stay put

ZED

(WHISPERS)

This ones mine

He takes his bow pulls an arrow from his quiver and slowly
draws the bow taking deadly aim at one of the cows He
shoots

The blunt pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and
bounces off The cow looks up
Official White 27

(contd)

ZED

(to Oh)

Were gonna need some arrowheads

Zed draws his flint knife then suddenly bursts out of the
forest dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back

Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying
Lying on the ground Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED
YOUNG FARMERS dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring
at him

FIRST YOUNG FARMER

Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh
CAIN

Cain turns to Zed and Oh and furtively mimes an elaborate

sewing gesture ancient precursor to the modern lip-zipper

ADAM

Greetings strangers I am called
Adam and you are welcome to share
the fruits of our toil
ZED

Thanks but Im kind of staying

away from fruit for the time being

Zed gives Cain a subtle acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them

awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks

ADAM
I fear the worst for Abel I am
sorely vexed

ZED
Yeah thats got to be pretty
vexing

A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly

on his sorry circumstances

ADAM

For my sin the ground is cursed
Thorns and thistles does it sprout
for us and we are doomed to toil
all the days of our lives For as
the Lord has commanded by the
sweat of your brow shall you get
bread to eat until you return to
the ground from which you were
taken For dust you are and to
dust shall you return

She is without a husband and as
the Lord has said thou shalt be

ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy On it
is the PRINCESS INANNA a stunning young woman richly
dressed and bejeweled with exotic eyes and luscious red
lips A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big
ostrich plume fan

Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her

Princess Inanna glances his way and cant help but notice
hes the only person in the square still standing She gives
him a quizzical smile then turns away imperiously

As the litter passes her handmaiden continues to stare at
Zed He doesnt recognize her but we do Its Maya now
elaborately costumed and made-up

She walks off before he can answer

Zed shakes his head looks around the room then STARTS
walking past a row of LIVING STATUES semi-nude men and
women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint
frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful
bodies

Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude GODDESS then
furtively reaches out and fondles her breast The goddess
slaps his hand then resumes her pose

GODDESS

ZED
Hey Youre a real girl That is
so cool

Official White

He moves down the row of living sculptures mugging at them
mock humping and waving his hands in their faces trying to
make them move but they remain frozen

ZED

Amazing

He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take This one
is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like
someone waiting for a bus He is also painted gold but
unlike the others he has a little potbelly and round
shoulders and cant seem to hold still for very long

Gomorrah just over the hill

guy like me

Official white

INANNA

I dont know I just find you--
interesting They say its the
will of the gods that some men
should suffer while others rule--
that were all just victims of our
fate And I believed that until
this morning when I saw you
standing up alone in the square
And I said to myself finally
heres one man who refuses to bow
down to anything--

ZED

UH--

(considers explaining but
just lets it go)

Yeah Thats me

INANNA

Yes finally a man who has the
courage to question the order of
things--- a man chosen by the Gods
to do something great

ZED

(EXHILARATED)

Thats exactly what Ive been
thinking You wouldnt believe the
things that have been happening to
me lately I just didnt know why

EXT THE TEMPLE - NIGHT

We can see torchlight flickering inside the temple and TWO
FIGURES moving among the pillars

INT THE TEMPLE - SAME TIME 56

The High Priest is giving Oh a personal tour of the inner
sanctum Oh is scrubbed and dressed like a junior priest

HIGH PRIEST

My life is devoted to the service

of the Gods and the good of the

people I take nothing for myself

He has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every
finger and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and
emeralds

OH
Thats so-- unselfish of you

HIGH PRIEST

Yes it is Its just so-- lonely
Sometimes i hunger for the touch of
another human being

(COoY)

Heres a riddle what has two
thumbs and wants another oil rub
(pointing thumbs at

HIMSELF)
This-guy
Ohquickly changes the subject

OH
So where does that hall lead to

HIGH PRIEST

(his eyes light up)

Come Ill show you

He takes Ohs arm and leads him down the hail toward a set

of
incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing
and arcane religious symbols
HIGH PRIEST

(contd)

Behind those doors is the Holy of
Holies-- the earthly domain of the

(MORE )

Official White
HIGH PRIEST (contd)
Gods-- a place so ineffably sacred
so powerful that to enter is
instant death for any mortal

OH

Wow

(a long beat)

So who cleans it

HIGH PRIEST
it needs no cleaning

OH

No of course not

(cant let go of it)

Kind of makes you wonder though--
the guys who built it did they
just die the minute they finished
or did the Gods give them a second
to get out

HIGH PRIEST
(starting to get annoyed)
I assume they finished it then the
Gods descended

OH

Yeah thats probably it
(another long beat)

So youre saying we cant go in

HIGH PRIEST

I just told you To enter is
instant death Only I can go in
and only once a year after very
elaborate purification rituals and
days of special prayers and
offerings

OH

(QUICKLY)
Right right right

(BEAT)
What if we just open the doors and
stick our heads in

HIGH PRIEST

Fine Enough Im sorry I brought
it up Lets go

Yes Finally Now youre talking
Should I enter it right here or

Does the Holy of Holies like to be
entered from behind or--

INANNA

(POINTS)

Thats the Holy of Holies-- you
have to go in there and talk to the
Gods

ZED
The Gods are in there

INANNA

So they say but the only one who
ever goes in is the High Priest
They say its instant death for
anyone else to enter

ZED
Then why am I going in

INANNA

(IMPATIENT)

Because you were chosen If the
Gods wanted you dead they would
have killed you already

ZED

for To speak to the Gods and
plead with them not to destroy the
city Then come back out and tell

columns and hides in the shadows A beam of moonlight
reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead

Cut TO

OF HOLIES - CONTINUOUS 58

Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates
himself face down on the floor arms outstretched in
supplication He lies there with his eyes tightly shut
expecting to be vaporized any second A long moment passes
in total silence Then he opens his eyes and looks around
tentatively

The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with
marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights
above

ZED

(takes a deep breath and

starts improvising)

Thank you O-- Merciful ones for--
not like-- killing me and letting
me receive the uh blessing of
your holy-- godliness

He exhales and closes his eyes again waiting for some
divine

response Nothing comes

Official White

ZED (contd)
(props himself up on his

ELBOWS)

Okay I dont know the right words--
so Im just going to say what I

have to say-- if thats all right

right thing Eating the fruit was
bad I know that-- and the Cain
thing-- and I have done somethings

disgusting sometimes-- but probably
pretty hot too--

Not that you would get off on any
of it-- okay Im getting off the
subject Anyways the word is
youve been considering destroying
this place So Im asking you not
to-- as a personal favor

(NOTHING)

Feel free to jump in anytime I

could use a little guidance here

Still no response He rolls over onto his back

ZED (contd)
Look I know you think this place
is evil and it kinda is-- I see

that-- but thats not everybody

(contd)

There are a lot of good people
too So what if there were like
fifty really good people Would
you still destroy the city

(SILENCE)

Okay youre right that may be a

good people if I really looked

revelation He sits up on the floor
ZED

Okay wait Is that the sign The
silence Is that it

Then a
It is isnt it Just this really
silent-- silence

(PONDERING)

Youre not going to tell me what to

to me-- youre going to speak
through me If thats right dont

(listens for a beat)

Oh and if things dont work out
with Maya would it be okay with you

carnal knowledge Not in an evil
way or anything--

EXT PUBLIC SQUARE - EARLY MORNING

A curious jeering MOB is gathering as Zed and Oh in
shackles are led by a SQUAD OF GUARDS to a raised platform
in the middle of the square

The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd Cain
presides over the execution He addresses the crowd

CAIN
For the crimes of blasphemy--
(the crowd grumbles its

DISAPPROVAL)

HERESY--

CONSPIRACY--
(serious grumbling)

SODOMY --
(admiring oohs and aahs)
And the murder of my brother Abel--
ZED
Oh come on

CAIN

Shut up For these and other

crimes they may not actually have

done yet but were pretty sure they

were thinking about the prisoners

will be stoned to death

The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull

canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush
to

grab stones to throw
Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other

PALACE BALCONY

The King Queen High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the
stoning from their vantage point above the square Princess
Inanna refuses to look

baseball-size rocks in their hands

The people fling their rocks with all their might

Zed and Oh duck

The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd

the opposite sides several bystanders taking painful hits

the head some falling down unconscious

Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks
from all directions

CAIN

Okay Stop Halt Hold it This
isnt working

ZED
Can I make a suggestion

CAIN

(IRKED)
What

Official White

ZED

Why dont you just pick one person

to throw

The crowd thinks thats not a bad idea and murmurs

ZED

(pressing the advantage)

In fact dont you think it would

be fair for us to get to pick the

person who stones us

Cain looks doubtful but the crowd thinks this is eminently
his

(contd)

fair

their hands and waving
like school children)

the power of the mob He nods to Sargon who signals to Cain

CAIN

The boy picks up a good-size rock
Zed turns to Oh

ZED
Good thinking huh

smacks Oh right on the forehead The crowd cheers
ZED

ZED
(contd)
(shouts to the King)
Why didnt I die in the Holy of
Holies
On the balcony everyone is totally stopped by his question
One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be
stumped
In the square the crowd starts muttering Zed seizes the
initiative
ZED

KING
Imbecile

PRIME MINISTER
Majesty with respect whether hes
chosen or not is no longer the
issue To kill him now given the

lean
and hungry looks
Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him
CUT TO

SARGON

addressing the crowd in the square

SARGON

By order of the King the sentence

has been commuted

The crowd cheers Zed and Oh exchange hopeful looks

CAIN

merciful King that the prisoners
are to be enslaved to toil at hard
labor until they die of exhaustion
or starvation

Yes

Was that a sign from God Wasnt
it a sign Whats the deal We
all want to know But Im not sure
anybody really knows-- and Id be
real suspicious of people who say
they do If Ive learned one
thing its this the world and
everything in it is a miracle And
what that miracle means is for each
and every one of us to figure out
for himself Are the Gods going to
destroy us Maybe-- I dont know--
I guess its possible But if we
keep going the way we are they
wont have to Were doing a
pretty good job of destroying
ourselves So maybe we should all
just go home now and think about
what happened-- and be very very
good to each other I know Im
going to try
(raises his hand in salute
to the people)
Peace
The crowd stares at him blankly Nobody knows what to make
of it all Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear

MARLAK
