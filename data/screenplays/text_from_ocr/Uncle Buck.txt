CHANICE
(interrupts)
You start work in the

Buck waves her off again Shes angry She doesnt realize
the seriousness of the matter

unorthodox behavior

BUCK
Ill grab a clean pair of
scivies and be on my way
(pause)
Tell Cindy Im sorry
Buck swings his legs over the side of the bed and hangs up
the phone Chanice is still staring at him He sits for a
moment letting it all sink in

CHANICE
(bitterly)
So much for your promises

BUCK
(annoyed)
My sister-in-laws father had
a heart attack

Chanice doesnt respond Its something she cant complain
about She has to separate the event from the larger issues

eo CHANICE
Im sorry to hear that

Buck gets out of bed and crosses to his closet

BUCK
They need me to watch their
kids
CHANICE
So youre not starting work
tomorrow
BUCK
I dont see how I can
CHANICE
(facetiously)

And you seem real
disappointed You were
probably the first call
because he knows you dont
work

Buck comes out of the closet with an armful of shirts and
pants

BUCK
I work okay I just dont
work like you work

CHANTICE
Gambling is not work

BUCK
Gambling is a hobby

CHANICE
Oh sorry Whats your work
then

BUCK
Pardon me I dont sell
goddamn tires Which is in
your book the most noble
thing in the world And
anybody who doesnt do it is
a bum

Buck pulls a cotton laundry bag out from under his bed and
begins filling it with clothing

CHANICE
7 Buck I wouldnt care if I
knew you were sincere about
me and about helping make
some kind of future for us

Buck crosses to the bed and grabs his pillow He pulls the
pillow out of the case and fills the case with socks and
shorts

BUCK
Working at your place is a
future huh My wife my

boss
CHANICE
My husband my partner
BUCK
(pause)

Yeah right Maybe this is
for the best Maybe we need
to cool things off a little
bit

He crosses back to the laundry bag and takes out a pair of
sweat pants He slips them on

CHANICE

Or after five years maybe
we need to quit kidding
ourselves I dont have the
spare years laying around
anymore that I can spend on
somebody who wont and maybe
cant get serious about
himself or anyone else

BUCK
Its your call

CHANICE
Its that easy for you to
say

He reaches under the chair for a shirt He quickly checks it
for excessive dirt Its alright He slips it on

BUCK
If youre not staying lock
up I gotta go Theres two
legitimately unhappy people
waiting for me

ran CHANICE
(softer)
Call me if you change your
mind about the job or
anything else

BUCK
You do the same The numbers
in my book
He starts to exit

CHANICE
Buck If you need help

BUCK
If I can’t handle a couple of
kids for a few days youre
right about me
And hes gone

cant give her the life she wants

for years

MATIZY
I asked God to make Grandpa
get better and he did

BUCK
You should thank him

MAIZY
I will Then I was thinking
of going for a VCR for my
room and a swimming pool for
next summer And

BUCK
You shouldnt pray for things
like that

MATZY
Do you know how expensive a
pool is

BUCK
Maizy prayers are for
important things Things that
matter to your heart Like
your Grandpa Lets say you
put in a prayer for a
swimming pool and a VCR And
at the same time somewhere
another little girl is
praying to save her mother or
someone that she loves Up
there in heaven the angels
are busy dealing with pool
contractors and the Sony
people about your VCR and
they dont hear this little
girls prayer Would that be
right

Maizys sufficiently startled

MAIZY
Thats how it works

BUCK
Thats the general idea Im
not a theologian but the
point is you pray for the
absolute most important
things

MAIZY
Does the Bible have a list of
these things

BUCK
No You know in your feelings
Lf youre praying for
something important or
something selfish and stupid
- You already did that when you
prayed for your grandpa

Maizy takes a moment to digest the information She nods that
she gets it

MAIZY
Could I pray for you to live
here

BUCK
No because I already have a
place

MAIZY
But isnt it weird and
lonely

BUCK

Sometimes its lonely Id
say its more messy than
weird but its home and
thats where I live and you
live here and I can come
visit you cant I

MAIZY
Itd be better if you were
here on a permanent basis

BUCK
Youll see me if you want
You just go to sleep and
think about how great it is
that your Grandpas okay and
that your Mom and Dad are
coming home You want a
whisker kiss

MATZY
If you insist

Buck leans over her and gives her a quick rub on the cheek
with his stubbly chin She giggles and pushes him away Buck
gets up and crosses to the door

BUCK
Sleep like a rock

MAT ZY
