OVER BLACK The march of boots radio chatter

UP FROM BLACK

EXT UNNAMED COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAWN

Small and rural Flanked by Northern California pine
Or perhaps Oregon

FOLLOWING A CAMPUS SECURITY GUARD

Having just arrived for his morning shift The pace of
someone stunned on-guard

Taking in the eerie world around him

The aftermath of a car fire

Broken windows and breached doors in faculty buildings
A LIGHT POLE fallen and smashed in the dorm parking lot

Black TIRE TREAD Everywhere

NEXT MOMENT

Guard moving down the main pathway FLASHLIGHT roaming
the pavement It’s still a bit dark Daylight
struggling through a cool November mist

His radio crackles small chatter

He radios something back into a handset Requiring
police medical assistance

We soon understand why
BLOOD SLICK on the cold pavement

Guard FOLLOWS its grim course All the way up to a BODY
Partially out of FRAME

Don’t need to see it Too gruesome to digest
A body dragged under a car probably crushed

FOLLOWING GUARD
As he has to take a beat and stop catch his breath
Goes back into his handset

GUARD
County be advised I have another body
Looks like a young woman late teens
Severely injured Repeat I have another
body on my 20
Unidentifiable chatter from the operator

Guard reaches down Checks her bloody bruised arm for a
pulse

GUARD (CONTD)
Negative She is dead Guys I need
some support now

CLOSE ON HER HAND

Cut-up FINGERNAILS painted bright red Eerie against the
pale dead skin

UP FROM BLACK

COLLEGE CAMPUS SEEN THROUGH A DORM WINDOW

Late-day sunlight trickles through the glass We SEE the

last of student and faculty cars heading out the main
gates

AARON (0S)

(reading)
Whose woods these are I think I know
His house is in the village though
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow

INT DORM ROOM - SAME

JUSTINE WILLS lies on her side in bed watching the
sunset through the window FRAME her FACE
Pretty but not beautiful A quiet introspection mixed
with the aura of accessibility

Every American college sophomore

AARON (0S)
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods --

He kills a laugh Makes Justine grin a little shake her
head

JUSTINE
You’re so immature swear to God

AARON (0S)
What

JUSTINE
What you’re laughing at the queer part

AARON (0S)
C’mon give me a little credit

JUSTINE
Then stop laughing

AARON (0S)
No I just can’t believe you’re doing a
paper on this

ON AARON Her boyfriend Lying in bed beside her shirtless
Reading a passage in her poetry book

AARON (CONTD)
I mean this is fairly 8th grade Good
fences make good neighbors weve been
through this

JUSTINE
The paper’s about Robert Frost not any
one specific poem Don’t be a snob
Aaron

Aaron moves up against her Kisses her bare shoulder
Justine’s looking down at her hands preoccupied
AARON
I’m not being a snob I don’t know I
guess I’ve heard this one too many times

JUSTINE
Then go read your Edmund Burke philosophy
bullshit
CLOSE ON HER FINGERNAILS

She’s applying a new coat of red polish Cherry red
identical to the polish on those dead fingernails

AARON

Kisses her neckline She finally gently rises from off
her bed Aaron watches

AARON
We getting something to eat

JUSTINE (0S)
I’m not hungry

AARON
Youre pissed

JUSTINE

Having just thrown on a college tee Still in underwear
A lanky athletic figure A swimmer’s body

AARON (CONTD)
Seriously you want me to finish reading
the poem

JUSTINE
No You’re an awful reader

AARON
(grins)
Thanks

She goes for her pair of blue varsity sweat pants thrown
on the floor Starts putting them on

AARON (CONTD)
I’1l be back Monday
JUSTINE
Come back when you want

AARON
All right so this is about Thanksgiving

Throws him his pair of jeans

JUSTINE
I don’t care about Thanksgiving

AARON
No you obviously do Justine You’re
the one who didn’t want to come

She moves to the corner where her COMPUTER STATION sits
We spot other BEDS of her roommates Made and
unoccupied They’ve already left for the holiday

AARON (CONTD)
What Is it really about what my mother
said before

Justine checks her email on her laptop
JUSTINE
Aaron I don’t want to talk about it
You got laid you can hit the road now
AARON
(nervous laughter)
Oh My God Justine
JUSTINE
(doesn’t look at him)
And I need my little 8th grade book back

AARON
Justine

Beat She finally looks his way He has a hand out

JUSTINE
I just did my nails

His arm’s still out Justine fumes Finally drifts over
to the bed Aaron kisses her hand

Makes her grin
JUSTINE (CONTD)
Don’t try it can’t work

AARON
Not a little
(holds out his fingers)
This much

Justine has to wipe the grin from her face Shakes her
head Aaron goes smaller

AARON (CONTD)
This much

She gently clasps his fingers Brings them to barely
touching Aaron smiles small

AARON (CONTD)
I‘ll take it

JUSTINE
I know you will

Beat He runs a hand down her cheek Something
apologetic in his eyes Justine quietly accepts it

Whispers something in her ear She shrugs

JUSTINE (CONTD)
No not now

AARON
Why not

JUSTINE
Because

AARON

Can’t keep up

JUSTINE
Oh it’s the other way around

AARON
(kissing her)
Then prove it

JUSTINE
Don’t make me
AARON
C’mon

JUSTINE
(giggling)
Don’t make me

SMASH TO

INT INDOOR POOL - LATER

Justine in swimsuit doing quick efficient sequence
strokes Racing against Aaron

NEW ANGLE

The big pool is all theirs A long and eerie place

ON JUSTINE

Making it look effortless Duck-dives underwater at the
deep end Comes back up even quicker She’s already
half a lap ahead

Aaron hits the edge can’t win Throws off his goggles

AARON
All right

Voice echoes across the big cement rafters She stops
mid-swim Big smile

JUSTINE
Owned

AARON
So owned

INT SHOWER STALL - NEXT MOMENT

Under hot water they kiss Gentle softly He whispers
something in her ear She laughs slaps his shoulder

EXT CAMPUS GROUNDS - DUSK

High fieldstone walls erected around its small
attractively manicured quad The quintessential brick
buildings suggest a more rural Columbia
Oddly there is nothing overtly Gothic or eerie about the
place It’s rather mundane and chipper in the dying
light

EXT DORM PARKING LOT - SAME
Sun now sinking into the pine-laden horizon

Aaron dressed and ready to head out Throws his tote
and backpack into the passenger’s seat of his black Jeep
Cherokee The air of money

Comes around the truck where Justine stands Dressed
back in her swimmer knits Hair still wet

AARON
Last chance

Justine nods arms crossed

JUSTINE
Yeah For you

AARON
You know I have to go Come with me all
right You have work to do so do I
She won’t bother you I swear

Justine weighs this Looks out into the darkening sky

JUSTINE
Aaron it’s got nothing to do with your
mother I just don’t want to go I’m
not a big 20-to-a-table kind of girl

AARON
(small grin)
Now who’s being the snob

Justine shows a small retraction Maybe a little sad
even Gestures to the campus’ front gate

JUSTINE
5pm traffic you better roll

Aaron stares at her Suddenly pulls his small DIGITAL
TAPE RECORDER She grins has to shake her head
JUSTINE (CONTD)

Yeah I was wondering where your little

friend was

AARON

The only true way to survive Degon’s

lectures

JUSTINE

No argument there

He hits the RECORD

Say it

Say what

Beat

AARON

JUSTINE

AARON

You know what

Justine pauses Shakes her head

JUSTINE

You can’t corner me with technology

Aaron c’mon

I love you

AARON

(makes sure it’s recorded)

I love you
Justine regards this
STOP button on the re
Whispers it back

Aaron contemplates

Justine

Gently grips his hand pushing a
corder Moves closely to his ear

Smiles small Moves in

LONG SHOT

In the quiet of the abandoned parking lot they kiss

EXT PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Justine watches his Jeep drive through the big front
gates Arms crossed from the growing chill Waves a
final bye as the Jeep disappears through the gate and
down the path

Gates begin folding closed once again

Justine turns around Takes in the sudden and immediate
solitude around her

CUT TO

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS - DUSK
STATIC SHOTS

The entire place is now entombed in rural silence Cold
November sun has set on the freshly mowed lawns

EXT TRACK OVAL - DUSK

track Cell to her ear

JUSTINE
No when’d you send it
listens)
Well they suck here for mail Mom you
know that
louder )
I said they suck here for mail I’1l
probably get it Friday
beat)
Hello can you hear me No I don’t know
what it is the weather’s getting bad
here Hang on

She shakes the cell phone as a brisk whip of wind passes
Next one’s so strong she has to stop and wrap her zip-up
hood over her head

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(to herself)
Wow

NEW ANGLE

Justine moves past the bleachers glancing at the
GROUNDSKEEPER waiting for his Doberman to do his
business Laughs a little

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(into cell)
Hey No there’s a big dog taking a
dump I don’t know why I’m laughing

She waves at the Groundskeeper who waves back

JUSTINE (CONTD)
No it’s the Groundskeeper’s dog I
don’t know what its name is just
whatever I didn’t mean to get off track

Justine giggles a little

JUSTINE (CONTD)
Because it’s funny

Watches the dog head off with the Groundskeeper

JUSTINE (CONTD)

Of course I want to see you too Ill
see you Christmas the flights are
cheaper No they really are Mom I’m
on the other side of the country okay
Kim’s in Florida why aren’t you ripping
on her

(beat)
I’m kidding

Sound of distant thunder A thin sheet of rain passes

JUSTINE (CONTD)

Mom I’1l give you a call tomorrow it’s
starting to rain No it comes and goes
Say hi to Tom for me No you don’t have
to put him on the phone just say hi for
me

(beat)
Love you too Okay

Flips closed the phone Starts into a brisker walk
PANNING AWAY
To a nearly deserted campus and parking lot The

Groundskeeper and his dog are long gone Thunder booms
in the distance

INT DORM BUILDING - DUSK

Long stretches of abandoned halls Sorority posters on
the concrete block walls Thanksgiving decorations

The building is completely cleared for the holiday week

INT LAUNDRY ROOM - SAME
Justine wearing sweats and flip-flops Throwing two

loads from the washers to dryers Shuts the machines
closed Uses her card and starts the tumble

INT DORM HALL - MOMENTS LATER
FOLLOWING HER
Moving down the long hall Turns a corner Checks the

big RIDE BOARD and CLASSIFIED ADS for a moment Grins at
some funky band’s name Keeps going heading into the

INT BREAKSTUDY ROOM

Rows of vending machines TV on Justine uses one of
her laundry dollars on the snack machine Barely pays
attention to the LOCAL NEWS REPORT

ANCHOR
-- and with those flash floods becoming
more frequent state police may have to
temporarily hold off on the hunt for that
missing Randolph woman Kristy Matthews
last seen three nights ago leaving a
friend’s house in Dovertown

Justine all but ignoring the report Fighting with the
machine to take her dollar

ANCHOR (CONTD)
Len we are experiencing some rather odd
back-and-forth weather right here in our
own neck of the woods

WEATHERMAN
Yeah Tammy lots of rain and wind and
all that nasty stuff And
unfortunately it all seems to be heading
our way for tomorrow’s Tom Turkey Not
sure if you want to take that holiday
drive to grandma’s well we’ll have your
trusty KRVT five-day forecast right after
the break --

Justine finally gives up on the vending machine heading
off out the room Back into the

INT HALL
FOLLOWING HER AROUND ANOTHER CORNER

Spots a fellow STUDENT heading out of her dorm room with
tote and suitcase

JUSTINE
(shouting)
Bye Liz

STUDENT
(hall echo)

She heads off as we catch a glimpse of the DORM ELEVATOR
Justine watches her struggle a little with the suitcase

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(echo)
Need some help

STUDENT
I got it thanks

Justine waves bye turning the corner Sound of a CELL
PHONE ringing Silly little Pac-Man jingle She quickens
the pace FOLLOWING HER to her corner DORM ROOM

Works quickly to unlock her door as the ring goes to
four

JUSTINE
Shit

Finally throws the door open running for her cell phone
on the computer desk Flips it up

JUSTINE (CONTD)
Hey You on the freeway

INT HALL - LATER

Justine sits crouched before the open door of her dorm

Footsteps sound off Justine glances down the hall
SECURITY GUARD (WAYNE) in dark silhouette Gives Justine
a little wave

WAYNE
(shouting back)

JUSTINE

(back into phone)
No it’s Wayne from security Maybe I’1l
fool around with him

uniform

INT LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER
Justine’s pulling her clothes out of the dryer

I’m not lying Everything’s okay

Justine stares out her small window at the darkening sky

INT HALL
Justine now doing stretches Bored Tries a handstand

JUSTINE (VO)
Then come back if you miss me so much

She balances on her hands for a good five seconds
Finally falls back to the floor

INT DORM ROOM - NIGHT
Back at her computer on her cell Printing out pages

JUSTINE

No yes You said we’d be here together
this weekend but whatever It’s fine

(beat)
No there is no guilt trip Aaron Just
call me when you get home No I’m not
mad I’m completely at one with the
universe It’s all nicely balanced
okay

(takes a moment)
You too Happy Thanksgiving Call me
later

She finally flips the phone closed Puts the cell on her
desk Frustrated Maybe with herself Snatches up the
pages of her term paper Gives them a glance Lots of
work ahead

She leans back Hits PLAY on her small CD player Old
Roxy Music Makes everything a little better

INT BREAK ROOM - LATER

Back with the soulless snack machine Can’t get her
dollar through Finally pulls it out

JUSTINE
Asshole

Flips it the bird for good measure

INT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Justine Car keys in hand Waits out the final seconds
of the elevator

Doors open FOLLOWING her as she comes out the elevator
into the

phones to call up dorm halls Turns a corner where Wayne
sits at the SECURITY STATION

break

Justine smiles heading out the front doors

CUT TO

SECURITY STATION’S MONITORING PANEL

Black-and-white video of Justine Heading into the
parking lot

EXT PARKING LOT - CAMPUS QUAD - NIGHT

Dim streetlamps shine down on the pavement Justine
heads through the scarce lot to her little Honda Accord
sitting in the corner

Hits the keys Two chirps and the lights blink

EXT CAMPUS DRIVE - NIGHT

Honda cruises past FRAME heading for the big front gate
Cranky iron doors automatically open

INT HONDA - SAME

Justine drives through the gates passing a CHEVY
SUBURBAN Security white with the campus insignia She
waves at SECURITY GUARD (DAVE) Driving back into the
campus Rolls down her window

JUSTINE
Wayne wants his Hot Pockets

DAVE
(from the SUV)
What else is new

Justine giggles rolling her window back up Heads out
into the rural darkness

EXT HIGHWAY - DUSK
Honda turns out of the college drive onto the misty

patch of dark road Heading west into the final glimmer
of fading light

INT HONDA - NIGHT

Justine window half rolled down Radio on Headlights
glowing into the two-lane road ahead

NEW HEADLIGHTS coming over a rise of hill A slower rig
Trucker probably just starting his night haul

Passes Justine’s smaller Honda Loud roll of tires on
wet pavement as it clears Justine watches it head off
in the rearview

Looks back ahead Regards the spittle on the windshield
Flicks on the wipers for a beat to clear the glass

Shuts it off

HER POV - THE WINDSHIELD

Going over that rise of hill

NEW HEADLIGHTS coming on strong BRIGHT HIGHBEAMS
Justine has to blink put a hand over her face

Flicks on her own HIGHBEAMS to either alert or scold the
driver Car whips past her lights still bright

JUSTINE
Asshole

IN HER REARVIEW

The CAR suddenly slams on its brakes Tail lights burn a
vicious red

Justine on guard watches it from her rearview

The car just sits there in the middle of the road

A small trace of fear uncertainty in Justine’s face

She glances back to the road ahead And once more to the
rearview

THE CAR

Stalwart a moment more Forgoes that infamous urban
legend and starts to head out in the other direction

Justine regards it Turns back to the road ahead

JUSTINE (CONTD)
Happy Thanksgiving to you too

EXT HIGHWAY - SAME

Wet from the passing drifts of rain Justine’s Honda
drives onward into the country dark

EXT 11 - NIGHT
Rural the only place for miles

Justine’s Honda pulls off the highway cruising into the
small parking lot

INT HONDA - SAME

Justine pulls up to the front of the convenience store
Kills the engine Checks to see if she needs cigarettes

Opens the door leaving her COLLEGE ID SWIPE on the
dashboard Climbs out

INT 11 - NIGHT

Justine moves down the aisles collecting the appropriate
materials No Doz Twinkies Aleve Earplugs
Snowballs Water and Mountain Dew

Stops at the magazine rack Star and its newest
celebrity scandals She can’t resist Takes it along
with an Us

NEXT MOMENT

Justine moves down the medicine aisle Spots something
she’s been ducking for the last couple of days

PREGNANCY TESTER She subtly picks it up Checks the
directions on the side A moment of contemplation We
finally understand what’s been racing around in her head

Reluctantly she takes it with her almost hiding it
beneath the magazines

Behind her A FORM OUT OF FOCUS Ducked in a heavy knit
rain parka Suddenly passes her Little curt Justine
regards him No her

A girl

Tall and lanky Black fingernails All we really see
with the rain parka over her Carries a six-pack of
beer aluminum foil and packs of dishwashing gloves

It’s all a little odd and amusing to Justine Until she
glances through the windows Spots it in the parking
lot

A beat-up FORD CORDOVA

Parked off to the side of the store Tinted windows half
down Cigarette smoke rising from within PEOPLE in the
car Dark shadows Young like her The aura of
transient burnouts

Justine regards them a moment more Was it the same car
from the highway She’s not sure

NEXT MOMENT

Justine approaches the FRONT COUNTER Girl is ahead of
her paying for her shit

CLERK
ID

Girl gradually pulls her ID Hands it to him

Justine right behind her Has to move back as the Girl
stumbles a little Drops the box of aluminum foil and
the dishwashing gloves Some batteries

She bends down to the floor to retrieve her stuff Like
a kid strung out on bad heroin

Justine realizes she needs help Puts her stuff on the
counter helping the Girl recover the dropped items We
never see the Girl’s face

GIRL
(low and drained)
Thanks

Girl hands the remainder of her things back over to the
clerk He gives her back the ID

CLERK
Twenty fourteen
Girl pulls a wad of bills Spanks them to the counter

Has to fold open the crumpled ones
Clerk pissed and over-clocked Counts out the money

CLERK (CONTD)
Dollar short

Girl regards this Looks around Turns into Justine

GIRL (0S)
Do you have a dollar

Justine regards the question A little brazen and
entitled Glances out to the parking lot

That Ford Cordova is now pointed to the highway waiting

for the Girl
Justine shakes her head with a slight grin

JUSTINE
Yeah

Pulls out a dollar handing it to the Clerk Justine
glances back at the Cordova outside

She turns back to the Girl Clears her throat
JUSTINE (CONTD)
Was that your car back on the highway

before

GIRL (0S)
It’s not my car

She gestures to the Cordova

JUSTINE
You’re with those people

GIRL (0S)
Yeah But it’s not my car

Justine pauses Needs to say it

JUSTINE
You know that wasn’t cool with the
highbeams You can tell them that I said
that

GIRL (0S)
They already know

Girl snatches up her bag Heads out the doors

Justine watches the Girl abruptly leave heading out to
the waiting Ford Cordova

Slightly put off Justine goes for her wallet as the
Clerk starts ringing up her junkfood Glances back
outside

The Girl rain parka over her head Climbs into the back
of the Cordova slamming the door shut Black tint
cloaking the individuals inside

Car drives off into the night

ON JUSTINE

Watches a moment more A little chilled by it all

UNDER HER CLOSED DOOR

Hallway light suddenly dims She reacts Puts her phone
down

INT HALL

Justine comes out of her locked dorm room Stares down
the hall at a DARK SILHOUETTE of a MAN Pulling out a
long fluorescent bulb from one of the ceiling panels
Blackens the others out

Justine steps forward In the small shaft of light she
can make him his uniform as Dave the Security Guard

JUSTINE

Dave

Dave looks up face covered in shadows Waves slowly to
her

Justine shrugs motions to the hallway lighting

JUSTINE (CONTD)
What are you doing

Dave says nothing Looks upon her a moment more Heads
off with the handful of bulbs

JUSTINE (CONTD)
Dave

She starts off after him

NEXT MOMENT - TURNING A CORNER

Comes to an adjoining hall Dave is long gone It’s all
shadows and dim lighting

INT BREAK ROOM
Justine comes in Spots a table filled with unscrewed

FLUORESCENT BULBS All of the SNACK MACHINES have been
unplugged The air is stale

INT HALL - NEXT MOMENT

Justine moves out of the break room Regards the RIDE
BOARD Now completely bare cleared of any postings

The plastic pins have all been arranged to form one
complete straight line

No rhyme or reason to it
Justine stares at it a moment more Keeps going

FOLLOWING HER DOWN THE LONG HALL TURNING A CORNER

As she starts for the BUILDING ELEVATOR

LOUD MUSIC Jolts her back around Echoes and sways
down the long hall

Of all things the melodic intro of Roxy Music’s More
Than This

Justine absorbs it

INT HALL - NEXT MOMENT

Moving around the corner Justine spots her own dorm
room The music BOOMING from within Reverberating down
her dark hallway

NEW ANGLE - FOLLOWING HER

Moving to her open dorm room

Bryan Ferry’s love song to the world has never sounded
more eerie and filled with dread

It was fun for a while
there was no way of knowing

Like dreams in the night

-- who can say where were going

INT DORM

Justine cautiously turns into her room CD has been
clicked on

Justine Chilled Finally slaps the player off

Listens to the absorbing silence The rustle of curtains
in the wind

It’s only then she realizes her LAPTOP is missing
Concerned eyes glance at the dorm WINDOW now half-open
Curtains blowing restlessly

She comes over to the window Her LAPTOP is smashed to
pieces on the pavement below

JUSTINE
(a whisper)
Jesus
Justine’s eyes go from concerned to fearful Quickly
pulls down the window slide locking it shut Throws on
her flip-flops heading over to get her cell phone

It’s now MISSING from the table Justine absorbs this
A chill runs down her spine

NEXT MOMENT

Reaching underneath her bed Justine pulls a softball
bat

SMASH TO

INT DORM LOBBY - NIGHT

ELEVATOR DOORS open Justine comes out bat in hand
Tense eyes

The lobby is dead quiet She can barely hear the mumble
of late-night talk show

Approaching the SECURITY STATION Justine spots the
abandoned front desk

JUSTINE
Hello

Through a SECURITY WINDOW Justine makes the small TV
flickering in the darkness No one watching

SECURITY RESIDENT BOOK open on the counter Dorm
occupants and their room and phone numbers

Someone looked up her number

Justine starts around the counter to investigate CAR
ALARM suddenly sounds off Scares us all

Justine snaps to the FRONT ENTRANCE Has to clumsily
jump the turnstile Moves up to the closed front door
peeking through the plexiglass window

In the PARKING LOT her own Honda is flashing headlights
Alarm siren wailing

Justine regards this Opens the door starting out
Realizes shell be locked out Slips her flip-flops in
the door to keep it ajar

EXT DORM BUILDING - NIGHT

Armed with the bat Justine comes into the parking lot
Looks around her

JUSTINE
(shouting)
I have a fucking bat You see my bat

She checks all angles No one and nothing

FOLLOWING HER as she quickly cautiously approaches her
flashing screaming Honda

Ready with the bat Justine moves closer to the car
Realizes the front driver’s window has been smashed open
WIRES pulled from the electrical system

Can’t find the words to describe Justine’s face She
looks around her Feeling horribly exposed

The Honda alarm finally whines and dies
NEW HEADLIGHTS BEHIND HER

Justine jolts around Aurora Highbeams in her face Has
to shield her eyes from them

Realizes the car is the lone Ford Cordova from the 7-11
TWO FORMS Can’t see their faces Cloaked in dark rain
parka hoods

Justine absorbs this Steps backwards Starts back
quickly for the

INT DORM BUILDING - NEXT MOMENT

Kicks her flip-flops from out of the door slamming it
closed

Barefooted she comes around the security station Snaps
up the PHONE at the MONITOR PANEL

Anxious short of breath she dials 911 Suddenly
realizes the line is dead

JUSTINE
(a frantic whisper)
No

She hangs up the phone trying to think Glances into
the SECURITY MONITORS Suddenly spots them in different
angles

The two from the Cordova

Dressed in rain parkas wearing gloves Standing at the
side of the dorm building next to a POWER CONVERTER BOX

Justine’s eyes tense Watches the one with a TIRE IRON
pull open the box Fiddling with some of the inner
workings

He finds whatever mesh of wires he’s been looking for
Extrapolates them with the heavy tire iron

LIGHTS AND POWER SUDDENLY CUT OUT

Justine reacts as the MONITORS go dead

She takes heavy breaths looking around her Fans and
the whine of machinery putters and stops Full on black
out

Justine mutters under her breath Clutching that
baseball bat Fumbling a little in the dark she comes
over to the front entrance Peeks once more through the
small window

HER POV THE PARKING LOT

All dark save for the eerie glow of headlights from that
one Ford Cordova

Standing in front of it is a FORM One of the two from
the power converter box Dressed in dark parka hood and
filthy jeans

It’s difficult to tell from his twenty-yard distance but
he appears to be wearing a shiny reflective mask under
the parka

Justine takes a breath Before she can check another
angle

FORM 2 SLAMS HIS MASKED FACE INTO THE WINDOW

MASK MADE OF ALUMINUM FOIL

Justine SCREAMS falling to the floor Her BAT gets away
from her Rolls into the darkness As she struggles to

get up

TIRE IRON slams through the window Cracks glass
Sprays all over Justine She SCREAMS

TIRE IRON slams again More glass spills

Justine stumbles up unable to spot the bat FLASHLIGHT
flickers over her face

Across the lobby FORM 3 Dressed in Dave’s security
uniform

Like his cohort wearing that eerie mask made of aluminum
foil Black holes for eyes No mouth A wraith
Clutching Justine’s SWIPE ID in his gloved hand

Justine mutters hyperventilating in the sheer terror

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(hushed terrified)
What What do you want

Form 3 shows nothing Just standing there Enjoying it

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(finally screaming it)
WHAT DO YOU WANT

FORM 2 finally breaks through the glass ARM reaches for
the lock

Justine stumbles up tearing into a run SCREAMS as she
steps barefooted over the glass Fragments tear into her
skin

She nearly falls again Regains her footing No time to

retrieve her flip-flops Climbs over the SECURITY
STATION COUNTER as Form 3 starts for her

INT BACK ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

Justine limps through the dark tears running down her
face Bumps into the table where Dave was watching TV
Hides behind it

HER POV THE LOBBY

Form 3s FLASHLIGHT slashes over darkness Gently
reaches down and picks up Justine’s bat He’s now joined
by Form 2 with the tire iron

Both ducked in parkas and aluminum foil masks Like full-
bodied shadows they break off on either side of the
room Immediately start approaching

JUSTINE

Muttering terrified Trapped Nowhere else to go

THE FORMS

Moving around the security counter with their bat and

tire iron Flashlight beam gives their shadows the rise
of giants

JUSTINE

Under the table shaking from pain and terror
Flashlight flicker suddenly affords her a glimpse of a
half-ajar BATHROOM The ones used by the guard station

Justine takes a moment gearing for the hard sprint
With her sliced-up foot it’s going to hurt but --

THE FORMS

Moving into the room Now spotting her under the table
and --

JUSTINE
Wills herself up and SCREAMS Throws a chair into the

Forms Gives her the priceless luxury of an extra
second To run across the room falling into the

INT BATHROOM

Crashing to the floor she kicks closed the door Throws
all her weight against it locking shut the bolt

A quiet sterile moment

In the darkness Justine puts a hand over her mouth from
muttering crying Struggling to regain composure

Steps away from the door Listens intently to the sounds
on the other side of the door

Under the door she can see the shine of flashlight
They’re right outside in the room

Flashlight skims across the carpet A click and it
suddenly goes black

Justine regards this Quiet and trembling she pulls
that pack of MATCHES she got with the cigarettes from the
7-11

Takes a deep breath

Soft-strikes the match to light Burns the entire pack
to get enough visibility

Takes a step back watching the door

BUMPS into something slumped against the toilet Again
she checks herself from screaming

The small match fire glows all over her face Her
horrified EYES taking in the grim sight before her

SECURITY GUARD DAVE

Throat slit ear to ear from multiple thin razor blade
incisions Blood drenching his tee shirt and underwear
Stripped of his security uniform

Justine throws herself against the wall fighting the
urge to scream Drops the burning pack of matches
Crouches to the ground in tears

Dave’s dead sunken eyes reflect in the eerie glow of the
dying fire Still horribly 1 alive Saliva bubbles
gurgle in his mouth Involuntary muscles twitch

Justine has to shut her eyes to it Tears streaming down
her face

Beat

Opens her eyes again Has to keep going In the dying
fire she spots the small VENT above the toilet

3X3 Barely enough room to crawl through
Looks back at the dying Guard Lifeless now Dead

She mutters to herself A mind forcing the body up Has
to pick out a couple of glass fragments from her foot

NEXT MOMENT

With tears and hair running down her face Justine moves
over to Dave

Has to gently quietly push his dead bloody body off to
the side Give her leverage to climb the toilet seat

As she goes to check on the VENT

FLASHLIGHT clicks on again They’re right outside the
door

A low gentle KNOCK More terrifying than any loud rap

Justine has to practically hold her breath in silence
Stepping up on the toilet seat Getting hands around the
vent lid Held in by small screws

Wipes away tears pulling a dime from her pocket of
change With a trembling hand she inserts the dime into
one of four screws Begins keying it open

Justine takes a deep breath Works quickly furiously to
unscrew the bolt

Another quiet knock Justine wipes sweat from off her
eyes Summons words

JUSTINE
I -- I have a gun You hear me
(a little louder more
confident)

He had an ankle piece You missed it
when you took his uniform I found it
under under the toilet It fell under
the toilet You come in here I‘1l blow
your fucking eyes out

Silence from the other side Weighing the lie

Justine finally gets the first screw off Pings to the
ground The match fire is nearly out

She immediately begins working on the second screw
Mutters from the cuts in her bleeding foot Almost
slips
Beat
A second KNOCK More curt
JUSTINE (CONTD)
I’LL SHOOT YOU DEAD GO AWAY JUST GO
AWAY

She’s half way through the second screw A tinge of
hope Then

BATTERING ON THE DOOR

Loud and horrifying They’re using the bat to break
through the bolt

Justine SCREAMS at the third slam dropping the dime to
the ground It’s lost in the darkness

Another SMASH in the door Becoming warped at the
hinges

Justine no time or resources to unscrew the remaining
pegs With her bare hands fighting to pry open the
vent

Another SMASH Next one will break through

Justine digs her fingernails into the vent Breaks one
Uses a final SCREAM for strength Breaks the vent lid
Jumps squirms into the small opening

THE DOOR SMASHES OPEN

INT VENT - NEXT MOMENT

Justine crawls fast through the filthy space Won’t stop
to look behind her Hears their echo in the bathroom

Flashlight beams racing across the walls of the vent
TURNING A CORNER IN THE DARK

A trace of moonlight from a VENT leading to the outside

EXT SIDE OF BUILDING - NEXT MOMENT
Vent panel is fumbled open

Justine comes out face first Slips out tumbling into
a wall of manicured bushes three feet below

Cries out having scraped herself from the thorny bushes
Looks around her All is dark but quiet

She forces herself up starting through the grassy quad

NEXT MOMENT

Using the outlining quad to hide in Justine limps for
the front gate

EXT FRONT GATE - MOMENTS LATER

Justine moves under a growth of woods Checks her
angles Suddenly spots that SECURITY SUV at the closed
gate A centurion on guard

Justine whispers to herself Gambles a step closer away
from the wood growth to get a better look

SUVS LIGHTS SUDDENLY GO BRIGHT

We can now make FORM 4 behind the wheel Foil mask and
parka

The dead bloody body of security guard Wayne in the
passenger’s seat

JUSTINE

Shaking her head in horror disbelief Starts backwards
THE SUV

Suddenly powers on Goes full pedal

Justine SCREAMS as it starts for her She tears into a
run

HEADING THROUGH THE PATCH OF WOODS

Stumbles fights for speed Looking for anywhere to
hide

SUV BEHIND HER
Lights bright Roaring through the campus woods Thin
twigs that break apart in the overpowering strength of

the truck

Justine summons every possible inch of strength and turns
on the sprint Cut-up foot now covered in mud and blood

CUT TO
WINSHIELD’S POV
Tracking her Will run her down and --

JUSTINE

Finally arrived back at that section of building wall
Nowhere left to run Turns back to the SUV that is
roaring towards her

Has to SCREAM and jump from its path

AS THE SUV SMASHES INTO THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING

Front tires explode Hood’s mangled Stale HORN wails
into the night

Cold beat

Justine on the grass Ten feet from the wreckage
Looks up to see the DRIVER’S SEAT

Form 4’s already out of the truck Parka hood and foil
mask Before heshe can start out on Justine

Sound of a DOG BARKING

Yard LIGHT from the GROUNDSKEEPER’S HOUSE Suddenly
blinks on Alerted to the noise of the SUV wreck

Justine glimmer of hope Looks back to the SUV Form 4
has already vanished

GROUNDSKEEPER appears on his front porch dressed in
houserobe having just awoken

A dog barks like hell

Groundskeeper shines light into the damaged SUV
Justine starts for him

FOLLOWING HER RUN

JUSTINE
HELP HELP ME

Begins tripping in her limp

JUSTINE (CONTD)
HELP

Groundskeeper realizes she’s filthy foot bleeding
Turns on more flood lights

INT HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT

Groundskeeper helps Justine through the door guiding her
to a small seat Has to pull away his hard-barking
DOBERMAN

JUSTINE
Lock the door You have to lock the
door

Groundskeeper does it The dog throws big claws up on
the window glass Barks full fury

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(voice trembling)
Oh God They’re trying Trying to kill
me One tried to run me down with the
truck

GROUNDSKEEPER
It’s okay just calm down a bit-

JUSTINE
NO They’re out there they killed the
two guards Oh God

Groundskeeper pulls his dog back from the draped window
Glances out into the darkness

GROUNDSKEEPER
Who are they

Justine finds her voice again

JUSTINE
I don’t know
(fighting back tears)
They killed the two guards Blacked out
the power in the dorms

Groundskeeper absorbs this Looks at Justine’s swollen
foot

JUSTINE (CONTD)
They they have my ID They found out
my name and address they called me

GROUNDSKEEPER
Why
JUSTINE
GODDAMN IT I DON’T KNOW WHY

Doberman barks hard and heavy

GROUNDSKEEPER
Lady down

The Doberman moves to the front door Starts scratching

it up Groundskeeper heads past Justine

GROUNDSKEEPER (CONTD)
Stay here

JUSTINE
No don’t leave-

GROUNDSKEEPER
I’m not leaving you I just have to go
into the next room to call the police
It’s all right just stay here Okay

Justine takes a deep breath Nods

Groundskeeper grabs a small blanket from the couch
wrapping it over Justine’s foot

GROUNDSKEEPER (CONTD)
I’m gonna get some water and cotton for
your foot okay

JUSTINE
Just call the police Please

GROUNDSKEEPER
I will

Groundskeeper gives her a small look of assurance
quickly into the next room

Heads

Momentarily alone with the dog Justine scans the place

A lonely place

Living room and small kitchen A bedroom PHOTOS of the
Groundskeeper fishing One with him and a friend on a

pier

Justine glances at the Groundskeeper’s ID on the coffee

table along with his keys

Something suddenly strikes with her

FLASH TO

JUSTINE LEAVING HER ID ON THE DASHBOARD
Heads into the 7-11

FLASH TO

JUSTINE IN THE 7-11

Helping pick up the Girl’s fallen particulars Packs of

dishwashing gloves and razor blades The ones the Forms
are now using

BACK IN PRESENT
It all becomes clear

Groundskeeper comes back into the living room now armed
with a small 33 and a cell phone

GROUNDSKEEPER
Land line’s cut

She absorbs this Watches the man power up the phone

JUSTINE
You have a cell

He nods

GROUNDSKEEPER
Powering it up now

Doberman still barking relentless

GROUNDSKEEPER (CONTD)
LADY

Dog hushes up for a beat Whimpers and growls

Justine regards the gun in his hand Feels a little
safer by it

JUSTINE
(quiet confessional)
They took my ID Back at the store
(MORE)
44

JUSTINE (CONTD)
They distracted me and took my ID It’s
how they were able to get in

GROUNDSKEEPER
How many out there

JUSTINE
I don’t know Four at least

Groundskeeper weighs this Goes back to his cell phone

GROUNDSKEEPER
Okay here we go

As he dials -- LOUD SMASH FROM OUTSIDE
Jolts Justine Another

Groundskeeper moves over to the window throwing a drape
open

Spots two of the four FLOOD LIGHTS smashed out
Doberman goes wild

GROUNDSKEEPER (CONTD)
Sonsofbitches

Flash of a FORM running across the pathway Like a
wraith in black parka

Groundskeeper goes to his front door

JUSTINE
NO

GROUNDSKEEPER
I SEE EM

The Doberman tries getting through him barking
viciously

JUSTINE
DON’T GO OUT THERE

ANOTHER SMASH as more light blacks out through the
drapes

Groundskeeper throws open the door FIRES shots into the
dark Forms scatter

GROUNDSKEEPER
I’LL SHOOT YOU ALL YOU HEAR ME
(moves onto his porch)
GET THE HELL OFF THIS CAMPUS

Doberman barking wildly Finally powers through his
owner racing off into the darkness

GROUNDSKEEPER (CONTD)
LADY LADY

Dog’s form vanishes into the wall of black and mist
Groundskeeper tries looking beyond it Hears the dog’s
barks Vicious and confident

ON JUSTINE

Tucked away by the couch Glances through the drapes and
into the darkness

Doberman’s barks echo through the range Finally
abruptly CUT SHORT A yelp Brutal and sickly

HARD ON THE GROUNDSKEEPER

Absorbing the silence Eyes transform to something wary
and powerful

GROUNDSKEEPER (CONTD)
(whisper )
Lady
ON THE DARKNESS

New stir of movement Sound of something being cut up
even gutted

Groundskeeper’s face turns from fearful to enraged No
longer thinking rationally

GROUNDSKEEPER (CONTD)
Sonsofbitches Sonsofbitches

JUSTINE
(a whisper)
Come back inside

Groundskeeper starts out onto his porch

GROUNDSKEEPER
YOU FUCKING SONSOFBITCHES

JUSTINE
COME BACK INSIDE

He begins FIRING wildly into the darkness Heads out
after them

JUSTINE (CONTD)
NO

The door left wide open Justine stares at it Listens
intently to the battle outside

Another SMASH TWO MORE GUNSHOTS
People running
GROUNDSKEEPER (0S)
(from somewhere )

Kill you sonsofbitches

Fifth GUNSHOT echoes Followed by the hard THUD of a
bat

Someone collapsing
Terrifying because we never see it happen

Justine wild eyes Stares at that open porch door
Smacks back and forth in the night wind

Beat

A LONG HUMAN SHADOW then appears Moving towards the
door

Justine total instinct Fires up SLAMMING THE DOOR
CLOSED Bolts it again

Their cue to KILL THE HOUSE’S POWER

Justine reacts screams with a closed mouth Once again
alone and consumed in darkness

Sound of the Forms regrouping Conspiring to infiltrate

Justine quickly furiously moves into the KITCHEN
Starts throwing open cabinets

Looking for anything she can use
Finds a FLASHLIGHT It’s dim but functional
QUICK CUTS

Going through the drawers with the flashlight Pulls a
good piece of CUTLERY KNIFE Some rags

Cuts apart the rags using them as tourniquets for her
wounded foot

Small gentle knock on the front door Seems to be their
grotesque signature

Justine tries to faze it out Starts looking for any
other weapons Maybe another gun the Groundskeeper may
have tucked away

Beat

LOUD BANG on the front door She jolts to it They’re
coming for her

She looks up at the KITCHEN WINDOW
Back at the living room

Spots the Groundskeeper’s KEY RING he left on the coffee
table Keys to many doors in the campus

She has to go back for it
FOLLOWING HER

Rushing into the living room up to the coffee table
Another BANG on the door

Justine snatches the KEY RING Starts back for the
kitchen just as the FRONT DOOR SMASHES OPEN

She has to quickly duck into the BEDROOM
Locks the door shut Stumbles over to the BEDROOM
WINDOW Frantically wraps a pillow case around her hand

Punches the window open

BANGS on the bedroom door They’re kicking through the
lock and --

JUSTINE

Knife in hand Moves out of the shattered window --

EXT HOUSE

Falling to the wet ground Lands beside the body of the
dead Groundskeeper Hacked in the face and chest with a
tire iron and razor blades

Justine has to cup her mouth from screaming They now
have his gun

Justine regards him a moment more Remembers the man
having tucked the cell phone into his inner houserobe
pocket

Digs through it Through the blood

Comes up with the phone

Spots FLASHLIGHTS flickering against the walls One of
them’s turning the corner

Armed now with the knife flashlight and cell phone she
starts into a fast limp

EXT TRACK FIELD - NIGHT

Justine makes her way through the darkness back across
that desolate running oval Starts underneath the metal
bleachers trying to elude her pursuers

Finally comes to one of the HIGH WALLS securing the
campus from the wilderness surrounding it

She tries to climb
It’s twelve feet high and slick as oil

This coupled with her injured foot makes it impossible
for her the even get a glimmer of a foothold

Turns back around FORMS in the distance FLASHLIGHTS
searching the fields They’re looking for her

Heading this way

Justine has little choice but to press on

Forgoes the high walls and heads for the small patch of
pine forest scattered by the faculty buildings

NEXT MOMENT

FOLLOWING HER

Sprinting hard and heavy through the darkness All we
hear are her heavy breaths The sounds of twigs snapping
beneath her feet

She finally crashes down in a patch of cold still weed
Forms with flashlights are circling the track field For
the moment she seems to have eluded them

Looks around her She’s too far from the front gate

She wipes tears and sweat from her face Suddenly spots
the LIBRARY in the near distance The heavy protective
doors

A good place to make the phone call

She takes another moment Finally committing Starts
out across the dark quad

QUICK CUTS
Looking behind her No one seems to be on her tail

Reaching the front door she quickly fumbles the keys
Starts trying them Looks behind her again

The flashlights have now disappeared They’re most
likely on the move

Panicked and anxious she tries another key Won’t fit
JUSTINE
(angry whisper)

Cmon goddamn it

Another Key finally inserts She twists and pulls on
the bolt

INT LIBRARY - SAME

Comes through the big door into the cold darkness
Bolts it closed

Clicks on the flashlight throwing beams into the long
cavernous reading hall Stained glass and dark
chandeliers haunt the space

NEW ANGLE

Justine moves past the front desk trying one of the
phones Like everywhere else the lines are cut

Beat
She suddenly has to bend down Feels the pangs come and

go The reality of it finally hits her She bends down
and vomits

LIBRARY - COUNTER AREA - NEXT MOMENT

Moderately recovered Justine throws the flashlight strap
around her neck wearing it like a necklace

Immediately pulls the cell phone from her wet pocket
Clicks it on Watches the bars go from zero to four
It’s functioning

Hope small relief in her face As she goes to dial
911

PHONE SUDDENLY RINGS

She reacts On guard cupping the ringer to squelch the
sound Sees the ID UNIDENTIFIED CALLER

Beat

Justine weighs the moment Finally folds it open
Listens in silence to the other end

911 (0S)
(female operator)
911 Emergency did someone just call us
on this number

Justine reacts Small relief

JUSTINE

Justine closes her eyes for a moment

Beat

JUSTINE
Okay Thank you
(beat starts crying)
Thank you

911 (0S)
You’re welcome Kristy

Justine reacts

What little color was left in her face drains completely
Begins trembling Now realizing the trap that she just
fell into

911 (THE GIRL) (CONT’D)
Kristy Kristy Kristy-

Justine slams the phone closed Throws bangs from her
face As she goes to dial the real 911 --

STAINED GLASS WINDOWS SHATTER OPEN
Justine SCREAMS

More windows breaking Rocks and bricks fired into the
big hall Glass shatters to the floor

They know she’s barefooted using it against her
Justine running into the big READING ROOM

Starts underneath tables making an escape through the
labyrinth of long book rows

FOLLOWING HER QUICKLY

All around her FLASHLIGHT BEAMS flicker across the
shelves They’ve now made their way into the reading
room

Justine ducks a corner getting on the floor Tries to
make their BOOTS moving through the maze of books Hard
to see through the dark

She holds her breath Checks her CELL PHONE The bars
have receded She needs a clear place to make the call

The horrible smash of tables being overturned
Book shelves smashing down

They’re cutting to the chase by tearing down her hiding
grounds

Each thrown-down shelf prompts Justine to move further
away Finally finds herself against the wall Nowhere
left to go

As the final book shelves begin to topple Terrifying
because we barely see the people causing their fall

HARD ON JUSTINE’S EYES

Holding the knife up to her face Ready for the finality
of this Ready to fight them

But then Suddenly spots it in the corner WALL LADDER
Used to reach high books

Justine pays it a moment’s more glance Realizes she can
get up to the second floor and out a ROOF EXIT

With flashlight flickering across the walls with books
dropping to the ground she has about two more seconds to
contemplate

Finally commits making a mad dash for the ladder
Starts up it as the final book shelves crash down

Before flashlight beams can aim her way she’s already
over the ladder and railing of the

SECOND FLOOR

Falls over the railing onto the hardwood Accidently
drops the knife Falls into the darkness below

NEW FLASHLIGHT BEAMS race across the walls and ceilings
They’re heading for the stairs

Justine pulls herself up from the floor making a run for
the ROOF EXIT Again has to fumble for the keys

They’re moving up the stairs
Justine furious goes for another key Finally gets it

and turns Snaps the door open rushing into the roof
stairwell Bolts the door shut again

EXT LIBRARY ROOF - NEXT MOMENT

Justine comes out of the access way into the cold night
air Stumbling Foot showing signs of bleeding again

She moves up to the edge of the roof Tries the CELL
PHONE Bars now showing 50 Possible signal

Trembling finger dials 911 Rings long and hollow

JUSTINE
(cell phone to ear)
C’mon c’mon

SMASH OF DOOR from below They’re breaking through the
access

JUSTINE (CONTD)
ANSWER

Call connects on third ring This time a professional
male voice

911 (0S)

JUSTINE
(hushed terrified)
This is Justine Wills people are trying
to kill me I need police

The communication is bad filled with static

911 (0S)
Caller can you repeat again

JUSTINE
GODDAMN IT I NEED THE POLICE

DOOR FINALLY BREAKS OPEN Dark Forms in parka hoods
moving out onto the roof

911 What is your location

More static

JUSTINE
(crying muttering)
(BLACKED OUT) College You have to come
now

911 Caller say again

GUNSHOT Smashes roof inches from Justine She SCREAMS
dropping the cell phone

DARK FORM gun in hand Now joined by THREE OTHERS

OPERATOR’S VOICE on the fallen cell phone Buffered
barely audible in the bad connection

Justine frozen in the sight of the Form’s gun Backed
against the roof Nowhere left to go

Stares down at the grass and trees three stories below
Small GUTTER BROOK flowing cold and dark into a SEWER
PIPE

Looks back at the Forms Aluminum foil masks reflecting
in the flashlight Can’t see their eyes

JUSTINE
(breathless hollow)
Why are you doing this
They show nothing Give nothing

JUSTINE (CONTD)
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS

Form with the gun takes another step forward
Justine whispers something Maybe a prayer
Form raises the gun to fire

Justine SCREAMS

AND JUMPS OFF THE ROOF

COLLAPSING THROUGH PINE

HEAVY BRANCHES BREAKING HER FALL

ONTO THE HARD AUTUMN GRASS

Nothing cool or pretty about it It’s brutal and ugly
and looks as bad as it sounds

Justine rolls into the gutter brook Overflowing from
recent rainfall and mud Coughing panting Wind
knocked out of her

Tries to get up Winces in the new flash of pain

Cut-up foot now has a sprained ankle

She looks up to the roof above Sees the flicker of
flashlights move through the mist They’re approaching
the edge

She coughs Struggles in the pain Starts up Through
the sludge and cold water of the gutter brook

FOLLOWING JUSTINE

Stumbling tripping with her She wants to cry but
pushes it down Starts muttering Whispering to
herself Anything to stop thinking of the pain
Looks back around

ONE FORM

Remains on the roof The tallest of the four Watches
Justine as the others head off to give chase

INT SEWAGE DRAINCANAL - NEXT MOMENT

Justine scrambles through the small opening putting
flashlight beam into the darkness ahead It’s a void
Long and wet and scary as hell

She takes a deep breath and starts in Will have to
crawl for a good thirty fifty yards Doesn’t look
behind her

Concentrates on the yards ahead

CLOSE ON JUSTINE’S FACE

Feeling her way through the muck The shit and rocks

Has to stop occasionally and cough out the disgusting
black water spitting into her mouth

NEW ANGLE - FOLLOWING HER

Crawling heavy as she practically slides her injured
foot

Heaving breath Endless butterfly strokes in the pool
have conditioned her arms to work the pace

Finds herself going deeper The canal’s on an incline
becoming slick with muck and algae

She has to stop again to cough Pulls the flashlight
from around her neck Suddenly gets away from her
sliding down into the darkness

JUSTINE
(breathless )
No

Light drains from her face as the flashlight slips down
into further tunnelway

LIKE JUSTINE WE ARE COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN DARKNESS

All we HEAR are pants Echoes from everywhere The
sounds are warped and erratic

Justine engulfed in the void Creeps her way further
down Through the horrid filth

Again starts whispering something to herself

It’s only engaged with her in the darkness that we
realize what she’s muttering Robert Frost’s Stopping In

the Woods On a Snowy Evening

An eerie and spectral dynamic in this dark hell

JUSTINE (CONTD)

Whose woods these are I think I know

His house is in the village though
He will not see me stopping here
(coughs restrains tears)

To watch his woods fill up with snow

Sounds boom and echo around her She keeps going

JUSTINE (CONTD)
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest
(beat)
Darkest evening of the year

She stops Fumbles around Feels it in her fingers
The FLASHLIGHT

Sound of Justine’s breath Like someone almost ready to
laugh Having found water in the desert

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(to herself)
Went out Goes out sometimes It’s
okay We check the batteries We turn
the batteries

Sound of her unscrewing the flashlight Switching the
batteries’ places

JUSTINE (CONTD)
(barely over a breath)
There we go Jus There we go

She seals the flashlight back up Shakes it Clicks the
button

A flicker of light then nothing

JUSTINE (CONTD)
Okay c’mon

Shakes it again

Clicks button

ny

LASHLIGHT BEAM RETURNS

CLOSE ON JUSTINE’S FACE
Icy tears coursing down her face Small look of relief

Suddenly hears the small crackle of vermin Turns
flashlight on

A FLOOD OF RATS

Covering her legs and feet Snaking down the sewer
canal

Justine SCREAMS Kicks her legs as the vermin bodies
scatter like pond water to stone

More ahead running through her hair and face She has
to shut her eyes SCREAMS using the flashlight as a
weapon Some bite into her hands

She bashes one dead with the flashlight Keeps on
moving Never crawled so fast in her life

Working through the fleeting horde

Following the sound of new brook water

Moonlight giving new shadows to the drain pipe The end
in sight

Justine furious eyes Working her muscles faster

harder than any swimming competition The roar of
falling water soon eclipses everything else

EXT DRAIN PIPE - NEXT MOMENT

Flashlight flickers as Justine squirms out the small
opening Stares down into a cold foam of dark waterfall
Pouring into a small pool of filthy brook water

Looks at the stone walls around her Realizes she’s just
outside the campus

Takes another breath falling down into the freezing
water

WITH HER AS SHE RESURFACES

Breath frosts in the dead of night Gains her swim
reaching out to some sharp wet rocks Pulls herself out
the brook

Falls to the wet brush for a beat Having suddenly
realized how exhausted her body is Shivering cold

Feels like Iceland Wants to collapse into sleep

Sudden drip-drop of blood stirs her around Pings on wet
rocks beside her She regards it Glances up above

Puts a hand over her mouth Breaks into a soft sterile
cry As we soon realize what she’s staring at

A MUTILATED DOG CARCASS

Hanging on the tree branch The skinned body of the
groundskeeper’s Doberman

Justine has to stop herself from screaming out Knows
they may be close possibly guarding the perimeter

Has to take a deep breath and say it to herself

JUSTINE
(a whisper)
Get up Justine get up
(angrier)
Get the fuck up

She talks herself into it Finally struggling up
Winces at the pain Closes her eyes collapsing against
a tree Swallows a breath

NEXT MOMENT

Justine limping through the dark woods Basically
following the moonlight Any direction away from the
walled-in campus Stops for a moment to get her
bearings

Suddenly hears it First barely a rumble Becoming
more distinct tires on pavement

EXT WOODLANDS - NEXT MOMENT

FOLLOWING JUSTINE

Drenched and shivering breaking through the thin
branches Ignoring the scrapes and pine needles she

follows the sound of a car in motion Growing closer

Breaking through the final wall of branches Justine
comes to PAVED ROAD

Realizes she’s arrived on that thin strip of ROAD heading
in and out of the campus

Crouches down as a JEEP roars past her Takes her a
stunned moment to realize

JUSTINE
-- Aaron --
(coughing trying to find her
voice)
Aaron

EXT SIDE OF ROAD

Justine stumbles onto the pavement Takes a breath to
scream it

JUSTINE
AARON

Jeep BRAKES 10 feet from the front gate Red tail lights
glow in the mist

Beat

Door opens Aaron comes out tries spotting her through
the darkness

Justine takes another step into the road
Aaron realizes it’s her

AARON
Justine --

Justine limping towards him Falls a little

Aaron now sees she’s banged up wet and filthy Starts
for her

AARON (CONTD)
Jesus

JUSTINE
(through tears)
Get in the car Aaron

AARON
(starts running)
Justine what happened

JUSTINE
GET IN THE CAR

AARON
(worried scared)
Are you hurt-
GUNSHOT Smashes Aaron’s forehead
Blood sprays
He collapses to the road dead That fast

Justine horrified in shock

FOLLOWING HER SCREAMING

Stumbles over to him Dead on the ground Blood
continues to run out his skull

Tries to say his name Can’t utter it

Behind her FORM 1 moving out of the pine
Groundskeeper’s gun in hand

Justine As though momentarily oblivious to him
Crouches down beside Aaron’s dead body Gently running a
hand over his lifeless face Brain matter on the
pavement

JUSTINE
(muttering in shock)
Aaron Aaron
In front of her GATE manually opening
Form 2 revealed on its other side Tire iron in hand
Like his cohort staring at Justine for a cold moment
Amused by her dire expression Best night of their
lives
ON JUSTINE
Cold tears streaming down her face Looks behind her at
the Form with the gun In front of her Aaron’s Jeep

still sitting ten yards from the gate

Collective fear and terror turns to a silent rage
Growing hysterical Forgets about the pain

Just charges towards the Jeep SCREAMING
Form 1 FIRES off another shot Skims past Justine
Justine running on her bad limp Burning stare Racing

hard and heavy for the Jeep’s door It surprises Form 2
He starts for her and --

JUSTINE

Reaches the Jeep throwing herself into the --

INT JEEP

-- drivers seat SCREAMS and punches the gas SLAMS
into Form 2 so fast it throws him onto the hood

Justine no plan Just rage and action Batters Aarons
Jeep through the gate as Form 2 begins slamming the tire
iron into the windshield glass

His faceless foil mask reflecting Justine’s own eyes
Form 2 wields again splintering glass Justine SCREAMS
slamming on the brakes Hits her head on the dashboard
as Form 2 is catapulted off the hood

Slams down into the campus parking lot

We’re still with Justine Forehead cut In a momentary
daze glances through the rearview at Form 1 running back

through the open gate

Form 2 ahead of her struggling to rise from the parking
lot pavement

Rage returns to Justine Throws down the stick Punches
the gas

SLAMS INTO FORM 2 FULL-ON
He’s partially pinned dragged on the Jeep’s tow fender

Justine watching his struggling form from the SPLINTERED
WINDSHIELD Driving the jeep a good 40mph --

SLAMMING HEAD-ON INTO A PARKING LOT STREET LAMP

Crushes Form 2 instantly Breaks bones But he’s
scrambling still alive

Justine having taken another brunt from the steering
wheel

Throws the stick into reverse
Backs up momentarily releasing Form 2’s body

Practically sticks to the street lamp Arm flailing
trying to wield a tire iron that no longer exists

JUSTINE

Throws the Jeep into drive punching the gas Hits him
again So hard the big pole comes crashing down on the
Jeep Instant electrical spark Fries the hood and
roof

Justine braces as SPARKS shoot all around her Blood
slick on the broken street lamp is all that remains of
Form 2

Justine dazed from a small concussion Takes a hard
cold breath Realizes the electrical collapse has
created a car fire on the hood

Spots Form 1 moving towards her

Joined now by his TWO REMAINING COHORTS

Justine calculates Spots Aaron’s BACKPACK on the Jeep
floor Reaches down sweeping it up

Grabs a plastic CIGARETTE LIGHTER in his coffee holder
Starts out the open driver’s door as the fire breeds
around her

FOLLOWING JUSTINE

Limping through a shower of electrical sparks Heading
for the closest BUILDING for refuge

MOVING AROUND HER

As she picks up the pace Can’t sprint Has to limp -
jog badly outrunning the brewing Jeep fire now in the
BACKGROUND

Ten more feet and it EXPLODES Impact puts her down for
a moment Lights up the whole parking lot creating a
temporary veil between her and the rest of the crew
Justine keeps moving clutching Aaron’s backpack

MOVING AROUND HER ONCE AGAIN

Revealing a UTILITY ACCESS DOOR she’s making for Pulls
that set of keys from her wet pocket

INT UNDISCLOSED BUILDING - NEXT MOMENT
Veiled in darkness

Sound of keys wrangling DOOR finally opens as Justine
stumbles through

Nearly trips and falls at the STAIRWELL leading to the
BOILER ROOM level of whereever the hell we are

She shuts and locks the door behind her once again
entombing the place into darkness

With hushed heavy breaths she strikes up Aaron’s
lighter Puts it on full burn creating a mini torch
Glow gives her a bit of illumination

Uses it to find her way down the industrial grate steps

Moving moving

Arriving in the BOILER ROOM Stepping through silent
machinery and meters

FOLLOWING JUSTINE
The small glow of firelight travelling with her
Something primordial and ancient about it all Passing

down a small hall with a sign on cinder-block wall

Justine trembling from the cold and adrenaline Puts
the lighter up to a sign on a locked door

POOL HEATER
She absorbs this Realizes she’s in the POOL AND GYM

BUILDING Keeps moving finding her way to another set
of STEPS

INT NEW ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

Door unlocks and opens Justine comes through eyes
glowing in the lighter burn Bangs hanging down her
face

FOLLOWING HER

Through a small alcove Turning a corner revealing the

OLYMPIC POOL AREA

The water black in the eerie lighter glow Diving boards
hover over the deep end A place familiar to Justine
Already knowing where to go she starts out Cringes in
her bad limp

Heading for a DARK OFFICE in the corner of the area

INT POOL OFFICE - NEXT MOMENT

Door opening Justine comes through throwing Aaron’s
backpack to the ground Immediately goes for the COACHS
DESK against the wall

Tries the phone Dead

Tries a locked drawer Shakes it furious

Has to spark the lighter once again to get visibility
Suddenly remembers something

NEXT MOMENT

Opens one of the wall cabinets pulling a RADIOVAC
TVRADIO MODULE from a shelf The kind used for
campingemergencies

Tries the module’s built-in FLASHLIGHT It’s working

NEXT MOMENT
Justine sets the module on the desk Powerful flashlight

now sets the small room aglow Has the TV on for added
illumination

QUICK CUTS

Using a heavy paper weight Justine begins bashing the
click-lock on the drawer Has to stop a beat and listen
to the outside sounds They’1l be here soon

She bashes the drawer again

Finally breaks the lock

Ruffles through an odd assortment of junk and files
Finally comes up with what she’s been searing for
CABINET KEY

Unlocks a CABINET in the corner Pulls a MED KIT Some
small towels

MOMENTS LATER

With the glow of the small TV Justine applies the final
gauze to her foot and leg Sloppy but efficient
Working on the final bands

Opens Aaron’s backpack looking for anything she can use
Digs through his text books Comes up with that MP3
RECORDER

She wipes another tear away Her eyes suddenly freeze on
SOMETHING ELSE in the big pouch She gently pulls out a
silly little TURKEY STUFFED ANIMAL and a card

Opens the Thanksgiving card
SORRY FOR LEAVING LETS HAVE OUR OWN HOLIDAY
LOVE AARON
CLOSE ON JUSTINE’S FACE
Absorbing the simple significance
Tears begin forming

Finally has to cup her face and sob Ultimately drops
everything falling to her side on the floor

As though the shock has worn down Realizing the full
horror of his death

JUSTINE
No
(beat enraged)
No

SCREAMS it VOICE booms across the place
Tinny voice from the unseen LOCAL NEWS REPORT

We hear the name Kristy

Justine heavy breath Reacts Turning to the unseen
PORTABLE TV Sets her face aglow

REPORTER
Yes David it appears all but confirmed
now that the body discovered an hour ago
in the woods just off Dars Harbor is
indeed that of twenty year-old Kristy
Matthews

Justine absorbs this Face pale and frozen

REPORTER (CONTD)

With signs of bludgeoning even after the
victim’s death police are now
investigating this as a particularly
brutal and bizarre murder Now there are
apparently no leads into-

Big BANG

GENERATOR LIGHTS suddenly power on They’ve breached the
gym heading for the big pool room

Justine reacts reaches up and clicks the TV off Kills
the flashlight

Outside the office the big rafter lights turn an eerie
red auxiliary

Justine low to the floor Starts out
MOVING WITH HER ON THE FLOOR

Newly bandaged foot Half-crawling through the ajar
door

(NOTE FOR THE DURATION OF THIS SEQUENCE THERE IS NO CUT
OUT THIS IS ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT WE ARE ENTIRELY WITH
JUSTINE IN HER EXPERIENCE)

Justine keeps low to the cold tile ground Spots the
roam of FLASHLIGHTS reflecting off the walls across the
pool room

They’re heading down that one utility hall
Justine regards the walls around her No exit save for

the locked front door and the hall Can’t go back in the
office

Summoning all strength she limp-starts for the deep end
of the pool

Sounds of their boots now echoing down the hall
Sinister and predatory

Justine quietly cleanly moves off the pool’s edge and
into the water

Careful

Very careful not to disrupt the water’s surface Cringes
at the burn of chlorine into her wounded foot

AS WE FOLLOW HER INTO THE BLACK WATER
The Forms’ FLASHLIGHT BEAMS now roaming the room

Justine takes the deepest breath of her life and
SUBMERGES

GOING WITH HER UNDERWATER

Far down eight ten feet Enough that she’s nearly out
of their visibility Has to hold her nose from any
escaping air bubbles

As we LOOK with her to the surface

FLASHLIGHTS skimming the water Relentless and bright

TWO FORMS moving down both sides of the pool Slow and
deliberate checking all angles

One stops right above us Shines flashlight into FRAME
Makes a momentary flicker across FRAME

Justine frozen as ice Beginning to experience the
pangs of airless seconds

The Form ultimately shifts flashlight Keeps going

Justine now clinging against the side of the pool
Waits out a few more seconds

INDUSTRIAL LIGHTS slam off She’s suddenly engulfed back
in darkness

Lungs ready to burst she finally gently comes up for
air

Breaks through the surface mouth first

Wants to drink in every inch of air but has to be quiet
and patient

Gradually pulls her head and arms out of the water
clinging to the edge of the pool Peeks over the
concrete crest

Spots ONE FLASHLIGHT roaming in the coach’s office

His cohort is gone

Justine calculates For the first time she has the
powerful advantage of surprise

Wills herself to gently silently climb the pool ladder
out of the deep end

With quiet achingly deliberate steps she creeps a dark
corner just before the office door

PANNING DOWN

To reveal what she’s been clutching in her hand all this
time THE KEY to the office cabinet Held like a
stabbing weapon

We PEEK with her through the crack of door Spotting the
Form crouched beside Aaron’s backpack Going through the

remainder of his college things

Justine closes her eyes for a moment Taking a final
beat before committing to this

(END OF CONTINUOUS SHOT)

INT OFFICE - NEXT MOMENT

FORM crouched before Aaron’s backpack Foil mask
cloaked under his parka hood Regards the MP3 recorder
and some text books

Presses PLAY on the recorder

JUSTINES VOICE
Say what

AARON’S VOICE
You know what

JUSTINES VOICE
You can’t corner me with technology

Beat

AARONS VOICE
I love you I love you Justine

Sound of a creaking door
Form snaps around Puts flashlight on the half ajar
door Creaking a little as though the wind or perhaps

someone moved it

Form calculates Starts forward KICKING open the door
Slams ugly against the cement wall

Checks all angles of the pool with his flashlight
Calculating Suddenly spots a small DEEP-END FAUCET
turned on Trickling new water into the pool

Beat

Form cautiously moves over to it

FOLLOWING HIM

To the edge of the water Crouching down to twist it
off Takes a beat shining FLASHLIGHT into the black

water Sees his foil mask reflecting

More shockingly JUSTINE now right behind him

He whips around just as she STABS the KEY into his face
Stunned he drops the flashlight

Two hard stabs and she finally makes contact with the
eye

He viciously swings the tire iron but can’t see blinded
by the blood Like an automaton winding down the silent
predator wields the heavy weapon through the air Can’t
find his target

Justine athletic and alert anticipates the next swing
When it passes she slams into him

AND BOTH CRASH INTO THE POOL
UNDERWATER

Justine and the Form Fighting struggling six feet
below

He’s big and manic but this is her world Her eye’s not
gouged and she can hold her breath and --

THE FORM

Succumbing to the chlorinated water gushing into his
lungs Tries to get back to the surface

Justine full-on rage Strength she never knew she had
SCREAMS are buffered in the weight of water

Overpowering the shocked and stunned Form One more kick
and jerk before body finally goes limp Lungs popped

Justine still clinging to him Wants him to suffer
Finally lets go as his body sinks to the bottom

She plunges down to the pool floor grabbing the fallen
tire iron

NEXT MOMENT - POOL SURFACE

She breaks once more Inhales the wonderful air
Crying but this time with the exotic mixture of rage and

joy
Two down two left

Finds herself clutching her stomach Like a mother to a
future newborn Face surreal in the glow of the dropped
flashlight

Wiping off tears Whispers it to herself

JUSTINE
Won’t let them do it To you Won’t let
them take you Won’t let them take you
From me
(breathless)
Promise you Swear to God baby I
promise you

She looks around her Spots FLASHLIGHT heading quickly
through another hall alerted to the new noise

SMASH TO

Hand dryer ROARING from somewhere in the darkness

FREE WEIGHTS and NAUTILUS MACHINES cover the room Wall
mirrors A place of dread

Form 3 feels out the place Pulls that one GUN from his
pocket Starts out among the maze of weights and
machines

FOLLOWING HIM THROUGH THE FREY

Unlike his cohort he’s more cautious Calculating
Following a fresh WATER TRAIL undoubtedly left behind by
Justine

Shines light on the many posters Wrestling trophies and
such

A big workout MIRROR reflects his own foil mask

NEXT MOMENT

Having followed the water trail and hand dryer to a
SHOWERBATHROOM AREA Realizes the trail ends here
Must have used the hand dryer to dry her body of pool
water

Dryer finally stops

Gives silence to a new sound

whimpering

» breathless crying barely audible

Form 3 hears it but tries not to blatantly react Slowly
turns his head to the point of emanation

Smashes his shoulder

Form 3 slices her with a hidden Exacto RAZOR

She SCREAMS dropping the tire iron Adrenaline winning
over pain she scrambles for the dropped gun

Form 3 sweeps up the tire iron heading hard for her
Justine falls to the floor scouring the tile

Picks up an anaerobic workout staff Wields it through

Smashes out another mirror with the tire iron Looking

to corner Justine

So close that she can’t make a run for it Both wounded
ready to kill

Eyes just dark sockets Watching Justine prepare to
strike with the long lead staff It’s no match he’s
got that tire iron and --

JUSTINE

Steady eyes Furious intense Waiting to time it
right

Another moment Finally wields the tire iron with
horrifying strength Misses Justine’s head by a fly’s

wing

Now on the weak side of his swing and --

JUSTINE
Smartly neglects wielding back -- uses the staff as a
force weapon instead -- SMASHING HIS FACE WITH THE BUTT

Does it again

Blood suddenly foams through his foil mask She broke
his nose

Stunned by the blow he drops the tire iron

Justine SCREAMS smashing him again Enough force to
send him crashing back onto a weight bench

Doesn’t think Just drops the staff falling on top of
him Punches his broken nose with three consecutive
blows

He lunges for his Exacto knife but Justine gets it first
Slashes his foil face New streaks of blood form around
the metal

A final slash into his throat

Blood bubbles up from his larynx as he begins to cough
choke

Arms like cannery machines still grabbing for her face
Punches her eye giving himself a moment to scramble
forward on the bench press

Justine SCREAMS full rage pulling up the weight bar
SMASHES it down onto his head Does it again And
again Crushing his skull

His body convulses in the brain seizure

Justine furious possessed Doesn’t stop Slams them

Finally stumbles off the bench

Collapses to the hard foam floor

urge to just close her eyes and sleep

Punches the wall The pain and hate keep her alert She

Moves back over to the dead body on the bench Gets a
grip on his arms Fights to pull it free from the
weights One final pull and it sets loose

FOLLOWING GUARD

Moving through the misery and horror of the first
sequence Calls in his report

Following the blood slick up to that one YOUNG WOMAN
GUARD
County be advised I have another body
Looks like a young woman late teens
Severely injured Repeat I have another
body on my 20

Again he reaches down Checks her bloody bruised arm
for a pulse

GUARD (CONTD)
Negative She is dead Guys I need
some support now

As we SUDDENLY SPOT HER OTHER HAND The BLACK NAIL
POLISH still showing

It’s the Girl’s body not Justine’s
The sudden sound of whispers reciting
Guard shifts direction

Spots Justine back to us cradled on the ground
Maternally clutching something in her arms

NEXT MOMENT
FOLLOWING GUARD TOWARDS HER

We HEAR Justine’s low whispering voice She’s reciting
the Robert Frost poem

GUARD
Miss You all right

Guard quietly goes to his shoulder set Notices the
blood trickling from Justine’s clothes

GUARD (CONT’D)
I have a third civilian she’s alive in
need of med support
(approaching her)
Miss just sit there I have medical
assistance on the way

Guard gently puts flashlight on Justine’s face
Oblivious to his presence Cradling Aaron’s STUFFED
ANIMAL in her arms Handling it less like a toy more
like a child

Guard just stands there doesn’t know what to do
CLOSE ON JUSTINE

Hollow never blinking Cold and bleeding but doesn’t
know it

JUSTINE

(breathless whisper to

Aaron)
--- between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake
The only other sounds the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake

Guard talks softly into his shoulder set Something
about severe loss of blood shock

CLOSE ON JUSTINE

Hears none of it numb to the world around her Thinking
about the moments of life ahead of her

The possibility of going on

The stuffed animal crusted with dried blood Justine
wraps herself closer to it

JUSTINE (CONTD)
The woods the woods are lovely dark
and deep But I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep
(barely audible)
And miles to go before I sleep
GUARD (0S)
Miss
(beat)
Miss we gotta get you inside the truck
His HAND gently comes down upon her shoulder

GUARD (0S) (CONT’D)
Miss

SHE SCREAMS LONG AND CHILLING
CUT TO BLACK

END
