EXT LAKE POWELL - PAGE ARIZONA - NIGHT

Serene Secluded So dark the horizon line bleeds into the
PITCH BLACK LAKE The only light comes from the moon and

EXT LAKE POWELL - BEACH - NIGHT - SAME

--a CAMPFIRE burns bright SEVERAL 20-SOMETHINGS enjoy a big
Fourth of July party Booze flows Joints glow MUSIC BLARES

Away from the action TWO GIRLS swig from a Tequila bottle
Their spot gives them a view of both the party and the lake

JAMIE COLLINS has dark hair to contrast striking eyes
that shine with hope Still she seems unaware of her beauty

ERIKA BARTON is a bleach-blonde who unlike Jamie does
everything she can to exploit her good looks As they drink

ERIKA
You all packed

JAMIE
Theres nothing here I wanna take
with me Leaving it all behind

UNKNOWN POV a FIGURE lurks behind the girls -- too far to
hear details of their tete-a-tete but close enough to see
Jamies getting something off her chest After a few beats

Jamie swigs from the Tequila bottle -- hands it to Erika

JAMIE
To a new life

ERIKA
To new men

Erika takes a swig then locks eyes with a HANDSOME TOURIST in
the middle of the party As she sits up to approach him

ERIKA (CONT ‘D)
Pick me up in the morning

JAMIE
Dude if you’re not ready I’m
leaving without you

ERIKA

Yeah right Like you can do
anything without me

CCONTTNUED

GLORIA HARPER approaches the girls with a CAMERA She
wears a baby-T with the logo of a strip club “The Cockpit”

GLO
Okay lets get one last picture of
the two hottest bitches in Page
before they blow this joint

UNKNOWN POV the FIGURE watches Erika pull Jamie close as Glo
raises a camera They both smile and LAUGH as

GLO
Say “sleaze”

FLASH CUT TO

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON COVE - BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Large rocks surround the cove like fingers closing in on a
fist Erika moors a motorboat on the beach and stumbles onto
the sand with the Tequila bottle and Handsome Tourist in tow
UNKNOWN POV someone watches them from behind a boulder

HANDSOME TOURIST
Where are we

ERIKA
Hell knows Lake’s got more beach
than California Now shut up

She swigs the Tequila and kisses the Tourist -- liquor runs
from her mouth into his He props Erika up against a boulder

UNKNOWN POV the FIGURE watches their SILHOUETTED SEX Hard
Passionate As things get hotter the FIGURE steps CLOSER

Oblivious to the danger Erika moves in rhythm but just as

she starts to get aroused the Tourist SIGHS -- stops moving
ERIKA
Don’t tell me you already--
She opens her eyes -- sees a HEAVY CHAIN wrapped around the
Tourist’s neck -- and just as this registers - Erika’s head

SMASHES into the rock behind her Her face sinks in the wet
sand Dazed she rolls over and looks up as

ERIKA’S POV an UNKNOWN FIGURE steps over her the SILHOUETTE
of a well-built man A CLINKING SOUND as he unravels the
HEAVY CHAIN -- SWINGING it down on Erika’s head and
INT FORGOTTEN CANYON - CAVE - NEXT MORNING

Morning light falls on Erika’s motionless body She looks
dead untila SCORPION crawls along her face ERIKA BOLTS
AWAKE WITH A SCREAM -- flings the scorpion off but finds her
arms and legs bound with ROPE Panicked she looks around

ERIKA
Hello Is this some kind of a joke
Hello This isn’t funny Answer me

The ECHO of her voice is the only answer she gets

ERIKA’S POV she looks around the cave Two choices Behind
her lies a DARK PASSAGE that cuts deeper into the mountain A
wind whistles from inside -- UNKNOWN Up ahead a NARROW PATH
lit by a HEAVENLY LIGHT from outside -- FREEDOM

Erika gathers her courage -- crawls over to some sharp rocks
She RUBS the rope over them Hard Fast Her wrists scraping
the rocks until she breaks free She unties her feet and

Erika staggers down the NARROW PATH toward the light Her
bloody hands run along the cave walls CLOSE on her face as
she steps into THE LIGHT A smile as she takes one final step
toward freedom but just then we HEAR the unmistakable SNAP of
a BEAR TRAP and--

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON - MORNING - SAME

The UNKNOWN FIGURE watches from afar as Erika’s SCREAM ECHOES
through the canyon Despite only seeing him in SILHOUETTE we
can tell he has LONG STRINGY HAIR He takes a drag off a
cigarette then throws the HEAVY CHAIN over his shoulder

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON - CAVE - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

Shocked Erika tries pick herself up -- blood staining the
smooth sandstone walls She collapses in the dirt -- finds
solace in the HEAVENLY LIGHT until it is broken up by the
SILHOUETTE of the Unknown Figure He snuffs his cigarette in
the sand unravels the HEAVY CHAIN and CLOSES IN on Erika
She convulses with fear and lets out one last blood curdling
SCREAM as we PULL OUT from the cave to reveal hundreds of
identical cavesand FURTHER OUT to see a massive lake
surrounded by breathtaking cliffs and beachesand FURTHER
STILL until we appreciate the immense size of this place and
realize -- Erika’s body will never be found

EXT LAKE POWELL - PAGE ARIZONA - AERIAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Red rock cliffs contrast cool blue water A hypnotic panorama
until ROCK MUSIC BLASTS through the canyon and we find

A CUSTOMIZED CADILLAC ESCALADE speeds down two-lane blacktop
Dust and dead bugs cover the windows The LOUD ROCK MUSIC
coming from inside where

INT ESCALADE - MOVING - DAY - SAME

ALEX BUTLER drives He has the kind of confidence that
comes with being young good-looking and rich Beside him

JAY KLINE rolls a joint on the dash board He looks a
bit preppy for a stoner but he’s a pro In the back seat

BILL CONNER rubs his temple Muscular and overconfident
he reaches forward and turns the MUSIC DOWN just as--

JAY
That was the best part Jackson

BILL
I got a headache
ALEX
Who told you to get drunk before we

left town

WHITNEY LEONARD doesn’t look up from her mirror as she
applies make-up more suited for a nightclub than a road trip

WHITNEY
It‘s in his genes

BILL
Youd know all about what’s in my
jeans wouldnt you Whitney

Whitney shoots hima “fuck you” look -- then smears her make-
up when she gets BUMPED from behind by

PIPER ANDERSON rises from the luggage bed with a naughty
grin An athletic beauty she lets her hair down as

NICK PAYTON rises with his own satisfied smile Well-
groomed and educated he’s the group’s elder-statesman

CCONTTNITED

ALEX
Yo Nick so help me God if I have
to clean anything up back there

PIPER
You wont

ALEX
Marry me

EXT ARIZONA ROAD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

LAUGHTER as the Escalade SPEEDS by a SIGN “Lake Powell Pure
Now and Forever” SUPER UP “One Year Later”

EXT WAHWEAP MARINA - PARKING LOT - DAY - LATER

A modern ADOBE BUILDING sits atop a hill overlooking the
marina A SIGN above the entrance READS “Boat Rentals” An
AMERICAN FLAG and “4th of July” DECORATIONS blow in the wind

WORKING CLASS FAMILIES and OLD COUPLES unload foam coolers
and plastic chairs from dented mini-vans and old pick-up
trucks They stare at the customized Escalade like a UFO

INTEXT RANGE ROVER - DAY - INTERCUT

NICK
Im sorry Alex did we make a
wrong turn into Alabama

WHITNEY
Or 1985

Bill rolls down the window and addresses the “Coors Crowd”
who look at them like aliens from another world

BILL

Greetings Earthlings Do not be

afraid We are from the fuuuuture

As Alex steers the Range Rover toward the last parking spot

JAY

Hey if a married couple gets

divorced in Page they’re still

considered brother and sister

Suddenly a FORD BRONCO cuts Alex off and SKIDS into his spot

(CONTTNIED )

ALEX
(honks horn)
Dude what the hell

PIPER
Alex don’t be an ass These people
have guns

ALEX
Fuckin’ Chuck Norris just jacked
our spot
(keeps honking)
Not cool bro

A thick SILENCE as a DENTED DOOR SWINGS OPEN and out steps

JAMIE low-maintenance hot in tight jeans and a thin t-shirt

over a bikini top -- but this isn’t the same hopeful girl we
met in the opening This girl looks lost -- even bitter
JAMIE

There’s a valet up at the hotel
Stunned they all watch Jamie walk toward the Rental Shop
JAY
Back this bus up Jackson because
baby just took you to school

Everyone LAUGHS except Alex who swallows his pride

INT WAHWEAP RENTALS - LOBBY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Panoramic views of the lake On the walls hang maps safety
brochures and -- A MISSING FLYER FOR ERIKA As Jamie opens
shop someone walks in

JAMIE
Not open yet

SCOTT JOHNSON clean-cut with a “teddy bear” quality He
wears a perfectly pressed PARK RANGER uniform Looks worried

JAMIE (CONTD)
Oh g’morning Scott What’s up

Before he can open his mouth to warn Jamie--
RICK COLLINS wears aviator shades a cowboy hat and a

Park Ranger’s uniform He walks in -- hands Jamie one of
Erika’s MISSING FLYERS with the corners ripped off

(CONTTNITED

COLLINS

Found this in the hotel lobby
JAMIE

And
COLLINS

people on the lake this weekend

JAMIE

COLLINS

JAMIE

COLLINS
So you keep telling us You gonna
look for her Because I’m done
Hell we all are Jamie Had police
all the way from Flagstaff dredging
up the lake and nobody found her
Now I’m sorry but Erika’s gone
and the sooner you accept that the
better your life’s gonna be

As if out of reflex he pulls a cigarette from a pack and
then -- for reasons currently unknown -- gives Jamie a guilty
look before popping it in his mouth and walking out

An empathetic Johnson hangs back with Jamie

JOHNSON
He’s worried about you

JAMIE
Worried but he still smokes

JOHNSON
Not my place to say but I get it
Look Jamie maybe you oughta go to
the party tonight

Jamie shrivels up
JOHNSON (CONT’D)

Full circle or whatever they call
it Besides you look like hell

(CONTTNUED

JAMIE
Thanks Scott that’s just what I
needed to hear

JOHNSON
You know what I mean You could use
a good time

JAMIE
Ill see what I can do about that
here in the middle of bum-fuck

Johnson nods at the MISSING FLYER hanging above the counter
JOHNSON
Ill tell your old man I took that
one down
(smiles on his way out)
Think about what I said Jamie You
know I’m right
CLOSE ON JAMIE

She stares at the MISSING FLYER but

INT WAHWEAP RENTALS - BACK OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Jamie’s not staring at the PHOTO she’s staring at her own
reflection in the CRACKED MIRROR of a LOCKER She exhales a
deep breath but we can tell she’s still holding a lot inside

UNKNOWN POV a FIGURE watches Jamie as she changes into a

tacky “Southwest” uniform -- hints of flesh
Half-dressed Jamie stops -- HEARS someone in the lobby
JAMIE

Be right with you
A SHADOW rakes across the wall FOOTSTEPS in retreat

JAMIE (CONTD)
Hello Scott Dad

Jamie treads across the room to the OFFICE DOOR Standing in
the threshold she scans the LOBBY

Nobody there Unnerved she returns to the LOCKER

One last look in the CRACKED MIRROR before she SLAMS the
LOCKER DOOR SHUT and

(CONT TNIED )

Jamie buttons up the “Southwest” shirt but before she’s done--

UNKNOWN POV an UNKNOWN FIGURE LUNGES up from behind her and
GRABS JAMIE She SCREAMS and whips around to see--

MARK NAVARRO stands behind her A sleazy guy with long
hair and bloodshot eyes His presence is intimidating

MARK
Hey baby girl

He takes a moment to size her up -- preys on her anxiety

MARK (CONTD)
Thought youd be long gone by now

JAMIE
I’m working on it

MARK
Really You look like a scared
little kitty to me

She grabs a boat rental sheet and rudely tosses it at him He
fills it out with one eye on Jamie who grabs a set of keys

MARK (CONTD)
Must eat you up knowing she left
without you Can’t say I remember
ever seeing the two of you apart
Except when Erika came to work
(tries to catch her eye)
Too good for a lap-dance sugar

JAMIE
Not my thing

MARK
Afraid you might like it She did

JAMIE
Eat shit Mark

MARK
What Not saying you gotta smoke a
pole just swing around on one

Repulsed she tosses Mark the boat keys -- meets his gaze

JAMIE
I’‘d rather chew on glass

(CONTTNIUED

She tries to walk away but Mark GRABS Jamie -- PULLS her
CLOSE against his body She tries to break free but he HOLDS
TIGHT -- almost threatening as he reaches into his crotch
pocket and pulls outa grimy TWENTY DOLLAR BILL Quick
nervous breaths from Jamie as Mark traces the money along her
face between her breasts and down her quivering stomach
where he dips the dirty twenty between her bikini bottom and
pelvic flesh -- stuffing it in her waistline like a stripper

MARK
Seewasn’t so bad was it

He releases Jamie and walks out Humiliated she catches her
breath and shakes off the fear Then she eyes a PHOTO of her
and Erika in her locker -- good times Off seeing it she
pulls the TWENTY from her shorts and throws it in the TRASH

EXT WAHWEAP RENTALS - PARKING LOT - DAY
The Escalade sits in parking space at the end of the lot

Alex Bill and Nick unload cameras i-Pods and Louis Vuitton
luggage but when Alex grabs a bubble-wrapped PINATA

JAY
Easy Jackson Easy

Jay takes the PINATA -- carefully sets it down while

Whitney and Piper watch in disgust as a YOUNG BOY pisses
right there out in the open lot

WHITNEY
Charming

PIPER
Bet there’s some “Bud Lite” in his
blood

The Boys WEATHERED MOTHER (30s) gives the girls the evil-eye
as she pulls her son away The kid flips the girls off

PIPER (CONT‘D)
You’re right Alex this place is
so much better than Cabo or Belize

WHITNEY

Seriously I don’t mind the granola
thing but this is like caveman

(CONT TNIUED

ALEX
Chill The whole point was to get
away from the same old crap
Besides they have a bangin’ Fourth
of July party out here

WHITNEY
Ill believe it when I see it

JAY
And the Cousin Fucking Festival
doesn’t count dude

They all LAUGH but Alex feels the pressure As Bill pulls the
last item out of the back we see he holds AN ANATOMICALLY
CORRECT BLOW-UP DOLL -- her mouth wide open eyes dead and
lifeless There’s something creepy about her (beyond being a
sex doll) Off everyone’s wary look

BILL
What This is Carrie Carrie

PIPER
Youre sick

BILL
(to “Carrie”)
Don’t listen to them sweetheart

ALEX
(dejected)

Confederate Flag

Alex flips Nick off from over his shoulder

INT WAHWEAP RENTALS - FRONT OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Crestfallen Jamie stares at the TRASH CAN After a beat
despite herself -- almost instinctively -- she digs Mark’s
TWENTY from the trash and stuffs it into her pant pocket
ALEX (0S)
Excuse me I reserved a houseboat
Should be under Alex Butler

Jamie looks up -- an odd moment as they recognize each other

(CCONTTNIED 1

JAMIE
If it isn’t Mr Road Rage himself

ALEX

JAMIE

As she pulls his reservation up on the computer Alex looks
at her name tag it READS “Jamie Collins Arizona

ALEX

JAMIE

damage deposit

He hands her a BLACK AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD As she runs it

ALEX

(CONTTNIIED

ALEX

ALEX
Would a thousand dollars cover it

Alex takes Jamie’s stunned silence as resistance

ALEX
Okay two Please

JAMIE
Twothousanddollars

ALEX
So we have a deal Great

He peels 500 from a wad of cash -- sets it on the counter

ALEX (CONTD)
Here down payment

Despite the money Jamie’s still mulling it over -- thoughts
of going back to the party weighing heavy on her soul

Then with a charming smile Alex seals the deal with

ALEX (CONTD)
Cmon it’ll be fun

After Alex leaves Jamie pulls Marks TWENTY from her pocket

and tosses it back in the TRASH

EXT WAHWEAP MARINA - DOCKS - DAY - LATER

Jay slips a joint behind each ear and turns on an HIGH-TECH
DIGITAL CAMERA (this shit was bought in Japan) He points it
at Nick who douses sunscreen all over his black skin NOTE
Subjective still images and pixelated live footage from Jay’s
Digi-cam will be INTERCUT throughout

JAY

ALEX

Jamie smiles then sees Whitney who is clearly not happy
Bill walks up -- no qualms about having the BLOW-UP DOLL

BILL

Okay let’s call it a draw

He slides the joint behind his ear and sits up with Glo They

EXT “COCKPIT” HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT - INTERCUT

CLOSE on Mark who watches them and off his spiteful gaze

FADE TO BLACK

IN DARKNESS WE HEAR
A RHYTHMIC HEARTBEAT mixed with ECHOING MOANS After a few
thumps ABSTRACT IMAGES FLASH with each new beat The RHYTHM
growing LOUDER with every IMAGE as we--

FLASH CUT TO
A TIME-LAPSE SUNSET bathes the land in a menacing red light
SHADOWS crawl over rocks creating ominous “faces” in stone
A FLASH over the happy hopeful faces of JAMIE and ERIKA
A MENACING SILHOUETTE obscures the LIGHT left by the FLASH
A CIGARETTE falls from the mouth of JAMIE’S FATHER
YOUNG JAMIE smiles at PORCELAIN BALLERINA in a MUSIC BOX
A CIGARETTE lands in the wet sand of a cave
SILHOUETTED BODIES crash together in the heat of passion
A TEAR runs down ERIKA’S FACE mixing with DIRT and BLOOD
The glimmer of a HUNTING KNIFE scrapes against a stone wall
JAMIE bound and gagged in the same cave where Erika died

ERIKA’S EYE opens as we hear the SNAP of a BEAR TRAP and--

SMASH CUT TO

EXT DESERT ROSE - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

Jamie BOLTS awake in a sleeping bag on top of a lounge chair
As she sucks in her breath the METAL SNAP HEARTBEAT and
MOANS reverberate in the distance All a dream right

Jamie collects herself -- the only sound now coming from her
short quick breaths until -- THUD Jamie jumps out of her
skin Heart pounding she sits still listening for -- THUD

It’s coming from inside the boat As Jamie slips out of her
sleeping bag -- ANOTHER THUD -- followed by a CRY of pain

ANGLE ON a BBQ FORK as Jamie lifts it from the grill

INT DESERT ROSE - NIGHT

The only light comes from the moon which reflects dancing
water on the walls Gripping the BBQ FORK Jamie tip-toes
along the wall but stops when she hears ANOTHER THUD
followed by a heavy SILENCE

She takes a deep breath then ventures across the dark
narrow cabin -- every CREAK from the boat mocking her fear

She flinches at ANOTHER THUD -- then a MUFFLED SCREAM

Jamies HEART POUNDS as she edges closer toward the
commotion zeroing in on

A BEDROOM DOOR

Inside the sounds of the struggle builds in intensity along
with Jamies HEARTBEAT Jamie clinches the BBQ FORK a deep
breath and -- she RIPS OPEN THE DOOR to find

Jay VIDEOTAPING himself having sex with Glo and Whitney They
LAUGH when they see Jamie with the BBQ FORK in the attack
position

JAY
Hey looks like we got a fourth

Mortified Jamie SHUTS the door and we--

CUT TO BLACK

INT FORGOTTEN CANYON - CAVE - NIGHT - SAME

In BLACKNESS we hear what sounds like the WHIMPER of a woman
Then FOOTSTEPS over sand The AMBER GLOW of an incoming
lantern REVEALS that we’re in a cave somewhere on the lake
The BEAR TRAP before us tells us exactly which cave

A BOOT CROSSES FRAME -- hangs the lantern above and walks to
a corner of the cave From behind we watch as an UNKNOWN
FIGURE sits in the dirt He tends to something with great
care Stroking something An occasional grunt of pleasure as
we RISE OVER the UNKNOWN FIGURE to REVEAL

Hes combing somebodys hair JUST THEIR HAIR Blood and
chunks of flesh around the edges where scalp once met skull

With the scalp clean enough the UNKNOWN FIGURE takes the
“wig” and lumbers toward CAMERA (the source of the whimper)
As he gets CLOSER the whimper turns into a SCREAM and we--

SMASH CUT TO

INT DESERT ROSE - GALLEY - NEXT MORNING

A kettle WHISTLES as Jamie makes breakfast Fresh fruit Eggs
on the stove She pours the hot water in a French press with
coffee One-by-one everyone comes out looking like zombies

ALEX
Hey You all right

JAMIE
Yeah just a few things going
“hump” in the night

ALEX
I mean about Whitney

JAMIE
Ohit is what it is you know

ALEX
For what it’s worth Im sorry

JAMIE

After a beat Bill scuffles out looking worse for wear Nick
and Piper right behind him As they dig in

(CONTTNIIRED

BILL
Jamie I always said there were two
people who could drink me under the
table Alex and the devil

NICK
The devil doesn’t do breakfast

Whitney staggers out next having slept in her make-up She
smells the food then hurries outside We HEAR her vomit OS

BILL
Funny she usually waits until
after she eats to throw up

Jay and Glo shuffle out covered in nothing but bed sheets He
pours coffee and looks at a LAKE MAP spread on the counter

JAY
So where we going

JAMIE
Theres a great beach in Forgotten
Canyon

GLO
You’1l never get this boat in
there

JAMIE

I can handle it

NICK
What’s with the friendly name

JAMIE
It’s eight hours from anywhere so
not many people go up there

ALEX
Well I don’t know about everyone
else but after last night I could
use the peace and quiet

Suddenly Whitney SCREAMS from outside Everyone looks up

PIPER
She probably puked in her hair

EXT DESERT ROSE - SAME
They all run out to see Whitney looking over the lake

WHITNEY
Theres somebody out there

She points across the lake to a BODY FLOATING in the water

ALEX BILL
Holy shit Oh man

Alex and Bill JUMP in the water and swim toward the body

Jamie watches in petrified silence -- her worst thoughts
coming true before her eyes as

BILL
Call the police She’s dead

Bill and Alex swim the body back to the boat but as they get
CLOSER they start LAUGHING and that’s when we see

“CARRIE” (Bill‘s blow-up sex doll) Shes semi-deflated and
fully decapitated Everyone guffaws at the sight of the
headless doll but a rattled Jamie lets out a sigh of relief

She looks down at the water as if to say “thank you” and off
the waves we RISE UP to REVEAL we’re now in

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON - DAY - LATER

The landscape more CONSTRICTED now as they enter a slot
canyon filled with HIGH CLIFFS and DARK INLETS The changing
light creates LONG SHADOWS on the rocks that look like eerie
faces -- an image we recognize from Jamies dream The LOW
RUMBLE of the boat’s engine adds an ominous din to the
surreal landscape as

EXT DESERT ROSE HOUSEBOAT - INTERCUT
Jamie steers through the narrow canyon which seems to be

closing in from above As they chug along at a snails pace
the hull of the boat scrapes the bottom of the lake

Whitney MOANS at the jarring sound -- an ice bag on her head

Alex and Jamie share a LAUGH at her expense

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON COVE - BEACH - DAY - LATER

“Desert Rose” is moored on a perfect private beach

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON COVE - BEACH - DAY - LATER

Jamie shows Alex how to thread a fishing hook -- the TACKLE
BOX features hooks and wires Jay makes a sand castle with
Glo Piper forces Nick into an uncomfortable yoga pose

Whitney lies face-down in a lounge chair while Bill rubs
sunscreen on her back As he moves down to caress her butt

WHITNEY
There’s no inflation tube if that’s
what you’re looking for

BILL
C’mon Whit I thought our
friendship had benefits

WHITNEY
Aside from the fact that you’re a
back-sack-and-crack wax away from
me even touching you I’ve already
made enough mistakes this trip

JAY
I resent that

Everyone chuckles until they hear an APPROACHING ENGINE and--
MARK drives a powerboat onto the beach his TATTOOED FRIENDS

and “COCKPIT” GIRLS behind him The boat’s wake washing Jay’s
sand castle away

Jamie approaches them Alex Jay and Nick file in behind her
JAMIE
Two thousand miles of beach and you
gotta come here

MARK
Been hitting this spot for years

JAMIE
Maybe it’s time for a change

breaks free -- PULLS a HUNTING KNIFE It’s clear he knows how
to handle a blade Nobody makes a move until

SLAMS into the sand -- out cold

Jay pulls Glo CLOSE -- kisses her

JAY

that sounds like a WHIMPER He WHIPS around to see-

Nothing Jay looks back over the cliff at Jamie and Alex

Coming from a fissure in the rocks

MIXES INTO THE WATER -- his body in an unnatural position

broken body ashore She averts her eyes from the carnage
looking at the lake instead where the MOVING WATER REFLECTS

GLO’S POV the MARINE RADIO RECEIVER SWINGS unhooked from
the latch -- the rest of the RADIO SMASHED to bits

What the Lightfoot Hello

Glo ventures across the cabin toward the radio The RECEIVER
SWINGING in time with the MUSIC like a metronome As she
gets CLOSER suddenly--

THE MUSIC STOPS Glo freezes as a thunderclap of SILENCE
reverberates through the room A beat later all wear HEAR is
the RHYTHMIC SQUEAK of the SWINGING RECEIVER and

Glo short scared breaths as she finally reaches out to grab
the RECEIVER Silenceuntil--

THE MUSIC BLASTS AGAIN Glo snaps up -- looks at the window
above the radio and sees the DEATHLIKE REFLECTION of--

The UNKNOWN FIGUREBLOW-UP DOLL MASK It LUNGES toward Glo

Their bodies SLAM to the floor BANGING against the RADIO and

Alex STORMS in from the STERN -- eyes on Mark as--

He TACKLES Mark in his chair and pummels him

ALEX (CONT’D)
You think this is funny Do you

Jamie pulls Alex off and holds him back

JAMIE
Stop Hurting him won’t help

Guilt washes over Bill’s face for starting the boat He lets
loose with a YELL and KICKS the boat’s instrument panel in
frustration The added violence makes Piper lose her shit

PIPER
Oh God we’re all going to die out
here aren’t we If we don’t leave
now we’re all going to die

Relax were not going to die
(turns to Jamie)
because Jamie’s taking us out of

JAMIE
---I can’t

NICK
That’s bullshit

(CONTTNIUED 1

JAMIE
There’s no way we’ll make it before
dark
NICK

What difference does that make

JAMIE

Nick it took me almost two hours
to get us in here in broad daylight
and the boat was scraping the sides
of the canyon If I try getting us
out at night we’ll just get stuck
and be in the same position we‘re
in now

BILL
Sitting ducks

ALEX
I think that’s the idea

Mark chimes in from the other end of the room
MARK
Hey what are you guys worried

about Got me all tied up right

BILL
Shut up shitbag

Mark LAUGHS to himself until everyone looks at him

NICK
Hey you got something to say

MARK
They don’t teach you college kids
much common sense do they

BILL
Is that what you learned in Wood
Shop

MARK

I learned enough to know whoever
filleted your friend had to get
pretty wet doing it and I’m about
as dry as a preacher on Sunday

A tense silence as everyone turns away from Mark in a huddle

(CONTTNITED

NICK
Hate to say it but he has a point

JAMIE
We’re not cutting him loose

BILL
Then what should we do

ALEX
Send up a flare for help

JAMIE
We lost them during the fireworks
the other night

PIPER
So we just sit here and wait to
die

NICK

Fuck that noise
He grabs Piper’s hand and leads her away but--

Alex grabs Nick’s arm to stop him

ALEX

“Caught Mark” Who made you CSI

Nick pulls his arm from Alex and sides with his girlfriend

NICK
Shes right You weren’t on that -

NICK
I don’t remember seeing you there
either Jamie

PIPER
I do Guy has a freaking shrine
dedicated to her and her friend

This seems to take Jamie by surprise

BILL
Its true And he was nowhere to be
found which means he could have
been on the cliffs when Jay died

MARK
Maybe you guys should round him up
too

BILL

Who’s talkin’ to you shitbag

JAMIE
Look were not in a position to
try and figure this out We need to
make it through the night so we can
find help in the morning and let
the cops handle the rest

(CONT TNITED

It all makes sense to Alex He looks to Nick who finally
shrugs in resignation

NICK
Whatever

JAMIE
I’m gonna light a signal fire with

Aren’t we a little past sending
smoke signals

JAMIE
Park Rangers will recognize the

Trembling with fear she tries to free herself but the
harder she tugs the more the RAZOR WIRE DIGS INTO HER SKIN

Trying desperately to stay afloat without moving Piper scans
the length of the RAZOR WIRE -- across the canyon where

LEE BARTON (50s) holds one end of the RAZOR WIRE with gloved
hands A dirty weathered man he slowly pulls Piper toward
him -- like a hunter collecting his kill

Piper SCREAMS and struggles to break free -- the RAZOR WIRE
tearing deeper into her flesh Crying she wedges herself
against a LARGE ROCK and uses it to hold herself in place as

to find he’s really looking at--

THE EERIE LIFELESS FACE OF HIS BLOW-UP DOLL -- her cold eyes
stare him down -- her mouth frozen wide open as if in a
permanent scream on Bill’s behalf as--

The killer wraps a HEAVY CHAIN around Bills throat -- so
tight his skin pokes between the thick chain links and

The UNKNOWN FIGUREDOLL-FACE gets within inches of Bill’s
face -- close enough to kiss as Bill lets out his last breath
but suddenly--

With one last desperate swipe Bill GRABS the BLOW-UP DOLL
MASK and YANKS it of the killer’s face but all we see is

Confusion and surprise on Bills face before his body goes
limp and just then--

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE

Jamie SLAMS against the wall with momentum from running She
looks up to see the SHADOW of the UNKNOWN FIGURE strangling
Bill -- too dark to see any faces but

The UNKNOWN FIGURE looks down on Jamie from atop the steps
Jamie doesn’t scream -- she can’t find her voice

Still staring at Jamie from the safety of the shadows the
UNKNOWN FIGURE hastily breaks Bill’s neck with an audible
SNAP then FLINGS his body into Jamie before running away
With the killer’s FOOTSTEPS FADING in retreat Jamie sits on
the floor beside Bill’s body She trembles with fear and
SCREAMS when--

Alex appears behind her -- sees Bill’s body on the floor his
neck turned just a little too far

Almost catatonic she stares up at the DARK STAIRCASE and

beside her and his dead friend They’re both a breath away
from breaking down After a beat Alex swallows hard and

to Mark who struggles to speak through his gag Jamie recoils
as Barton kneels down before her -- looks her in the eye

LEE BARTON

(CONTTNIUED

Despite his harsh appearance Lee Barton looks sad Pained

LEE BARTON (CONTD)
You led me there Jamie Reckon I
owe you for that

Jamie weeps as Barton rambles on like a man who hasn’t had
company in years -- changing his focus between Jamie and Mark
as he digs the ICE PICK into the wood floor of the boat

LEE BARTON (CONT’D)

A man comes to a place like this
for peace To rest his soul Make
sure his children don’t fall prey
to sin Truth be told Jamie I
always hoped you’d rub off on my
girl You’ve always been a good
kid Maybe Erika wasn’t as strong

Jamie nods “yes” but looks over Bartons shoulder at

EXT DESERT ROSE - STERN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

His head hung low Alex brushes his hand over her face to
close her eyes Johnson crosses himself and pulls Alex back

JOHNSON
C’mon we can still help Jamie

INT DILAPIDATED HOUSEBOAT - GALLEY - NIGHT - SAME

Jamie shudders with fear as Barton pulls a LEATHER STROP and
a DE-HIDING TOOL off the wall As he SHARPENS the DE-HIDING
TOOL

JAMIE
Please I wanna know what happened
to Erika just as much as you but
you don’t have to do this

LEE BARTON
Yes I do
(to Mark)
--and it’s gonna hurt

Mark freaks out -- KICKING and SCREAMING through his gag as

Barton pins him to the floor and presses the DE-HIDING TOOL
against Mark’s flesh

(CONT TNITRD

CLOSE ON BARTON as
LEE BARTON (CONTD)
I’m gonna shave every square inch
of your hide until you tell me
where she is

CLOSE ON MARK -- SCREAMING through his gag choking on his
own spit as Barton SCRAPES the DE-HIDING TOOL down his arm

CLOSE ON BARTON -- clearly not enjoying this but clearly not
finished either Marks HOWLS not as loud as Barton who

LEE BARTON (CONTD)
Tell me where she is TELL ME

A CRACK and Barton falls out of frame to REVEAL

Jamie holds one of Barton’s CLUBS A grateful Mark watches as
she RACES across the cabin to

THE MARINE RADIO
Jamie grabs the RECEIVER

JAMIE
May-day May-day Does anyone copy

She SCREAMS when a HUNTING KNIFE SLAMS into the RADIO beside
her head Jamie WHIPS around to see

Blood running from Barton’s head as he picks himself up and
stares down upon a terrorized Mark

LEE BARTON
Don’t go anywhere son

He turns toward Jamie but she’s gone

EXT DILAPIDATED HOUSEBOAT - STERN - NIGHT - SAME

Jamie runs to the back only to find her KAYAK no longer
attached to the boat Panicked she sees Barton coming for
her In the dark he looks just like the UNKNOWN FIGURE

LEE BARTON
Jamie listen to me damn it I was
trying to help your friends

Fat chance Jamie runs around the opposite side of the deck
and hurries inside where

INT DILAPIDATED HOUSEBOAT BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME
Jamie ducks into a bedroom where she’s shocked to find

The SHRINE DEDICATED TO ERIKA -- DOZENS of PHOTOS of her in
younger more innocent times Some old PHOTOS of Jamie too

LEE BARTON (0S)
It’s a small boat Jamie

Jamie ducks behind an ANIMAL PELT She tries to control her
heavy breathing as

Barton’s SHADOW cuts across the room as he walks down the
HALLWAY Lumbering FOOTSTEPS -- MOVING CLOSER

Jamie silently cries as Barton stands in the doorway -- the
thin ANIMAL PELT the only thing protecting her from doom

He picks up a PHOTO of Erika and Jamie together
LEE BARTON (CONT’D)
I know this is all hard to accept
but I brought Erika into this
worldit’s my right
Broken Tired Jamie looks like she’s about to give up until--
THUD Something BUMPS the old houseboat from OUTSIDE

LEE BARTON (CONTD)
Jamie

He hurries out Jamie listens to his FOOTSTEPS -- as soon as
they FADE she hurries out of the room and
INT DILAPIDATED HOUSEBOAT - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Jamie BOLTS down the corridor -- breaking for the outside but
as she rounds the corner--

A HAND wraps around her mouth - PULLS her into the dark
Jamie tries to break free but settles when she sees

Johnson holds his finger up to his lips “Shhhh” Jamie lets
out a sigh of relief and hugs Johnson They whisper

JOHNSON
You okay

(CONTTNIUED

JAMIE
Yeah but he’s got Mark tied up in
the galley

JOHNSON
What’s he doing here

JAMIE
We found him on our boat near one
of the bodies Were gonna bring him
in and that’s when--

She goes SILENT as Barton’s FOOTSTEPS approach -- he’s right
OUTSIDE -- on the other side of the wall As he passes

JAMIE (CONT’D)
I don’t know what to believe
anymore

JOHNSON
Get in the patrol boat with your
friend If things get ugly I want
you to leave

JAMIE
Scott no

JOHNSON
Don’t argue with me Jamie I can
handle this on my own

Jamie nods “okay” and sneaks out but we FOLLOW JOHNSON as he

works his

way down the hall -- stopping in the threshold that

leads to the MAIN CABIN when he sees

Mark hog-tied on the floor -- the DE-HIDING TOOL beside him

No reply

JOHNSON
Lee Barton this is Scott Johnson
with the Park Ranger’s Service I’m
declaring this boat a crime-scene

Johnson looks concerned and confused while

EXT PATROL BOAT - NIGHT - SAME

Jamie climbs aboard Johnson’s Patrol Boat which is tied to

the stern

of the old houseboat Alex takes her in his arms

ALEX
Thank God

(CONTTNURED

JAMIE
Piper

ALEX
oenoO

A beat of remorse andthey both flinch when they HEAR a
BLOODCURDLING SCREAM so horrifying it doesn’t sound human

Jamie instinctively moves forward but Alex holds her back

ALEX
Jamie he told us to go

JAMIE
I’m not leaving Scott behind

Suddenly a GUN SHOT -- then the sound of a struggle Jamie
leaps out of the PATROL BOAT Alex follows
INT DILAPIDATED HOUSEBOAT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT - SAME

They rush inside to find Mark’s body convulsing on the floor
A STRIP OF FLESH RIPPED FROM HIS BACK

In the middle of the room Barton grapples with Johnson --
hes trying to get his GUN The two men CRASH into a TABLE
The GUN skids across the floor stopping at the feet of
Jamie grabs the GUN Holds it up

JOHNSON
Shoot him Jamie Do it

He pins Barton to the floor - choking him Jamie’s about to
shoot until--

Barton delivers a powerful mule-kick Johnson HITS the floor
Jamie tries to get a bead on Barton but he CHARGES across the
room toward Johnson who TACKLES him They both FLY over
THE KITCHEN COUNTER

Barton hits the floor with a THUD -- a KNIFE-BLOCK landing
right beside him He pulls a CARVING KNIFE just as--

JAMIE
Scott

Jamie TOSSES the GUN across the room Johnson catches it just
as Barton RUSHES into him -- BANG

CONT TNITFD

Face-to-face Johnson sees Barton’s bloody smile then looks
down to see the CARVING KNIFE buried in his own gut

ANGLE ON Johnsons SMOKING GUN as it drops to the floor
Barton collapses against the stove while

Johnson stumbles backward onto the floor the CARVING KNIFE
still in his gut

JAMIE
Oh God

Jamie runs to Johnsons side gently helps him lie down He
seems comforted by her presence but traumatized by

JOHNSON
-he killed MarkI saw itlike
an animal

JAMIE
Shhh Save your strength
ALEX
Here
Alex rips off his shirt -- gently sets it around Johnson’s

wound to soak up the blood Despite the pain Johnson can’t
take his eyes off Lee Barton

JOHNSON
Did I kill him

JAMIE
I don’t know

JOHNSON
Is that son-of-a-bitch dead

JAMIE
Relax Scott
(strokes his head)
You’re in shock

Johnson shivers as Jamie touches his face She looks to Alex
JAMIE (CONT’D)

Keep as much pressure as you can on
the wound

CONT TNITED

She tries to sit up but with surprising speed and strength
Johnson grabs Jamie’s arm (this is the first time we notice
Johnsons pretty cut underneath that Ranger’s uniform)

JOHNSON
Where you going

JAMIE
You need more than a t-shirt

As Jamie hurries out she steps over

MARK’S BODY -- only it’s not just a body MARK’S STILL ALIVE
He watches Jamie hurry out -- then eyes Johnson and Alex

ALEX
It’s not that bad

JOHNSON
No It’s only gonna get worse

One last look at Mark who starts to move as we--

CUT TO

EXT PATROL BOAT - NIGHT - SAME

Jamie lunges for the BENCH SEAT -- RIPS the CUSHION off and
OPENS the STORAGE COMPARTMENT Inside she finds

A FIRST AID KIT and a FLARE GUN She grabs the FLARE GUN and
as she FIRES it in the air we

FLASH CUT TO
UNKNOWN POV someone lumbers toward Jamie from behind as
The FLARE ILLUMINATES the canyon in a reddish hue and

FALLING FLARE CLUSTERS create MOVING SHADOWS across the boat
resulting in a sense of vertigo as

Jamie grabs the FIRST AID KIT -- then stops cold when

One of the MOVING SHADOWS is that of the UNKNOWN FIGURE
Shocked Jamie gasps and WHIPS around to see--

WHACK Barton’s homemade CLUB CRACKS Jamie in the head and--

CUT TO BLACK

IN DARKNESS WE HEAR (AGAIN)
A RHYTHMIC HEARTBEAT mixed with ECHOING MOANS After a few
thumps NEW IMAGES FLASH with each beat The RHYTHM growing
LOUDER with every IMAGE as we--

FLASH CUT TO
The TOURIST GIRL from the cave -- smiling alive on the lake
TIME-LAPSE as DARKNESS ENSHROUDS the friendly DAYTIME LAKE
A SHADOW HOVERS OVER the weeping TOURIST GIRL
BLOODY HANDS smear against a smooth cave wall
JAYS BODY flies off the cliff
BLOOD DISSIPATES as it DROPS into CLEAR BLUE WATER
PHOTOS litter the ground inside the cave
CLOSER to see the PHOTOS in the cave are of JAMIE
ERIKA mouths Jamie’s name but she has a MAN’S VOICE

CLOSER on ERIKA a MANS VOICE as she SCREAMS “JAMIE” and we--

SMASH CUT TO

INT FORGOTTEN CANYON - CAVE - NIGHT

Jamie BOLTS awake -- the FADING ECHO of a MANS VOICE calling
out her name REVERBERATES through the cavern From the dream

Jamie tries to move -- reels in pain from the bruise on her
head where she was clubbed The pang reminds her of what just
happened and in a sudden panic Jamie tries to sit up only to
find her ARMS and LEGS BOUND with rope -- she’s in the exact
same situation Erika found herself in

Hyperventilating with fear Jamie looks around -- knows where
she is and knows better to call out for help She crawls over
to some sharp rocks -- RUBS the rope over them Hard Fast
Jamie’s wrists scraping the rocks until she breaks free

JAMIES POV she looks around the cave Like Erika she has
two choices Behind her lies a DARK PASSAGE that cuts deeper
into the mountain A wind whistles from inside -- UNKNOWN Up
ahead a NARROW PATH lit by moonlight outside -- FREEDOM

(CONTTNIUED

Easy choice Jamie unties her feet and staggers down the
NARROW MOONLIT PATH that leads to freedom Her hands support
her tired body by running along the smooth cave walls Jamie
too tired to notice the blood stains along the rocks

ANGLE ON a mound in the earth at the mouth of the cave The
single SPIKED TOOTH of a BEAR TRAP poking out from the dirt
as Jamie quietly approaches

CLOSE on Jamie’s face as she steps into the moonlight A
smile as she takes one final step toward FREEDOM but

Just as her foot is about the touch the ground -- the SPIKED
TOOTH waiting for blood -- Jamie stops when she HEARS the
unmistakable sound of a human cry More like a WHIMPER More
like the sound Jay heard before he died

Jamie stops cold -- turns around to see the DARK PASSAGE that
leads DEEPER into the cave The WHISTLING WIND carrying the
WHIMPER toward Jamie like an invitation -- a prayer

JAMIE
(to herself)
-Erika
She turns around and walks into

THE DARK PASSAGE

Every sound bounces off the walls Every breath Every step
Every drop of water Every cry as

Jamie HEARS it again A WHIMPER -- more like a SOB now Then
the SOUND of a MAN’S VOICE MUMBLED RAGE Condemnation

The NOISES seem to come from every direction but all Jamie
can do it plod forward -- the darkness so severe she has to
use her hands to feel her way around until

Flickering FIRELIGHT bisects the cavern ahead

Jamie follows the light -- turning a CORNER -- moving FASTER
Each step bringing her CLOSER to the WARM LIGHT filling her
with more hope as she nears the source of the flames

JAMIES POV ahead moonlight mixes in with the fire Open air
lies just ahead -- and maybe help FASTER now as

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON COVE - BEACH - NIGHT - SAME

Jamie rounds the corner only to find herself standing in the
mouth of a cave on an empty beach Her beach

The FLAMES come from the signal fire “Desert Rose” still
moored on the embankment The cave system is all connected

Jamie grabs the SHOVEL Alex used to dig the fire hole and we--

CUT TO

INT FORGOTTEN CANYON - CAVE - NIGHT

Jamie back-tracks through the DARK PASSAGE with the SHOVEL as
her weapon She returns to where the FLICKERING FIRELIGHT
split the cavern -- ventures down the opposite corridor

FIRELIGHT FADING behind as Jamie braves DEEPER into the cave
Again DARKNESS enshrouding everything around her and

Again a WHIMPER coming from beyond Someone CRYING

Jamie takes a few furtive steps forward then stops when a
MAN’S VOICE BOUNCES off the walls Too much ECHO to make out
what he’s saying but it’s full of anger Between his rage
and the sobs we also hear a CLANKING followed by a THUD

Jamie follows the sounds -- picking up the pace until she
sees the DIM LIGHT of a LANTERN coming from a chamber up
ahead Jamie slows down -- tiptoes toward the brink of the

DARK PASSAGE that breaks off to REVEAL

JAMIES POV PHOTOS of the TOURIST GIRL stuck on the walls
and spread on the ground Jamie knows where she is but she’s
not close enough to see what’s going on

Catlike Jamie stays in the SHADOWS as she sneaks into the
cave She finds refuge in a small crevasse and peers around a
large BOULDER just enough to see past it to REVEAL

ALEX

Hog-tied like Mark lying face-down -- blood clumping dirt
around his mauled face as

THE UNKNOWN FIGURE

Swings his HEAVY CHAIN back-and-forth blood and chunks of
hair and flesh between the links

(CONT TNITED

Hiding behind the boulder Jamie can’t fully see the UNKNOWN
FIGURE -- only catching brief flashes of his arms shirtless
body and head as he darts in and out with the HEAVY CHAIN --
striking like a cobra between lines

UNKNOWN FIGURE
People like you think you can ride
in here with your fancy cars Buy
anything you want Take people away
from where they belong From home

Then suddenly he stops to admire his handiwork on

Alexs once charming smile lies in the dirt before him One
of his eyes has gone dead His nose almost mush But he can
still hear as the UNKNOWN FIGURE’S BOOTS pace back-and-forth

UNKNOWN FIGURE (CONT’D)
Yeah how you like that Nothin’
your mama’s plastic surgeon can’t
fix right Dumb fuck

PUSH IN ON JAMIE She flinches with each new blow but as the
Maniac’s rage turns into pain something sounds familiar

UNKNOWN FIGURE (CONTD)
Think you know her Think you know
what she wants This is home I’m
home You can’t take her away
because shell always come back
Way it works Full circle

His last comment hits Jamie so hard the blood drains from her
face She can’t help it her mouth opens agape and out comes

JAMIE
Scott
THE UNKNOWN FIGURE STOPS -- SLOWLY TURNS AROUND TO REVEAL
Scott Johnson -- the guy Jamie’s known since she was ten
JAMIE (CONT’D)
Oh God

Seeing Jamie Johnson drops the HEAVY CHAIN as if by doing so
he’s now less of a threat

JOHNSON
Jamie you don’t understand He
brought this on himself They all
did

(CONTTNUED

Shirtless he walks toward Jamie and for the first time we
see the chiseled body that’s been kept under that tight
uniform like a beast trapped in a cage As he gets CLOSER

Jamie crawls behind the boulder She grips the SHOVEL for
protection -- moving right as Johnson comes left and vice-
versa Back-and-forth they go Jamie wracked with fear while
Johnson seems to get off on it using the cat-mouse routine
to plead with Jamie

JOHNSON (CONTD)
I had a plan Jamie You werent
supposed to see any of this That
guy you just saw It’s not me I’m
still Scottie Look

He holds his arms out like someone waiting for a hug his
smiling face almost ignorant of the blood splattered on him

JAMIE
Youre fucking deranged Scott You
need help
Johnson looks hurt -- like this is news to him and suddenly--

Alexs mangled face SPRINGS UP behind Johnson with the HEAVY
CHAIN As he wraps it around Johnson’s neck

ALEX
Get out Now

But Jamie CHARGES out from behind the BOULDER and WHACKS
Johnson in the face with the SHOVEL Bones break He falls
backward into the dirt crushing a debilitated Alex

Jamie kicks an unconscious Johnson away and kneels down
beside Alex Barely able to breathe through his mashed up
face he still manages a smile

ALEX (CONTD)
Just couldn’t leave without saying
good-bye could you

Tears in her eyes Jamie chuckles with Alex who coughs -- he
ain’t gonna make it and Jamie knows that

ALEX (CONT’‘D)
Now get the fuck outta here

Despite his pulverized face Jamie gives Alex a gentle kiss

By the time she pulls away -- he’s dead Jamie breaks down
sobbing in a heap until

(CONT TNUED )

JAMIE’S POV she sees one of the PHOTOS of the TOURIST GIRL
Only this one isn’t the Tourist Girlit’s JAMIE

Stunned Jamie picks it up -- then flings it away and grabs
another Jamie again Then another Jamie

WIDE as Jamie looks around the whole cave to realize this is
not the same chamber they found the scalped Tourist Girl in
This is a totally different place -- and it’s all dedicated
to Jamie

Dazed her curiosity propels her DEEPER into the cavern where
she finds several her old belongings neatly spread out on a
flat rock All objects that have been discarded or long
forgotten a teddy bear a year book drawings in crayon from
when she was a child a training bra panties photos of
Jamie as a young woman -- her curves just starting to show

Shaken to her core Jamie lifts a PHOTO of her and her father
posing with Johnson on the lake Everyone in bathing suits
having a good time -- only Johnsons face is SCRATCHED out

Finally Jamie picks up a MUSIC BOX -- tears well in her eyes
as she remembers

JAMIE
(almost silent)
Mom
She opens the MUSIC BOX -- a BALLERINA dances to the tune of

“Twinkle Little Star” The memories too painful she SLAMS it
shut and then suddenly--

A VOICE strains out from the dark -- so weak it’s barely
above a whisper

VOICE (CONTD)
-jamie

Jamie JUMPS out of her skin with a SHRIEK -- WHIPS her neck
around to check on

JOHNSON
-his body lies next to Alex Both of them seemingly dead

JAMIE
Hello

No reply as if the voice used all it had the first time

(CONTTNIURED )

Jamie ventures toward the end of the chamber -- with each
brave step forward she HEARS BREATHING

JAMIE (CONTD)
Who’s there

Finally at the dividing line between the DIM LIGHT and
COMPLETE DARKNESS Jamie sees

A BRUNETTE GIRL

Chained to the wall like a medieval prisoner her head hangs

low so we can’t see her face but Jamie recognizes something
the girl wears the SAME SWEATER that Jamie was wearing in the
opening scene with Erika

JAMIE (CONTD)
(to herself)
--what the fuck

Appalled she steps CLOSER to the BRUNETTE GIRL who doesn’t
even look alive -- her head still dangling low

JAMIE (CONTD)
Hey

Jamie gently grabs the back of the girl’s head to lift her
up but the BRUNETTE’S HAIR falls off in Jamie’s hands like a
loose-fitting wig Jamie recoils as the hair slides off and--

The GIRL’S HEAD RISES to look Jamie in the eye and REVEAL

ERIKA gaunt dehydrated her blond hair chopped off Shes
been dressed in effigy of Jamie -- the brunette “wig” being
the scalp of the dead Tourist Girl who had hair like Jamie

JAMIE (CONTD)
Oh God

Every emotion Jamie has pours out of her horror elation
pity shame rage She hugs Erika then holds her face in her
hands -- speaks right at her -- gentle but firm

JAMIE (CONTD)
Were gonna get you out of here
okay

ERIKA
keythe box

(CONTTNUED

Jamie RUNS back to the MUSIC BOX -- gives it one last look
and SMASHES it against the rock The BALLERINA lands in the
dirt beside assorted GEARS WHEELS and a KEY

RAPID CUTS as Jamie UNLOCKS Erika’s chains First her hands
They drape over Jamie as she moves to UNLOCK her feet -- one
of Erika’s ankles badly mauled from the BEAR TRAP As the
last lock CLICKS Erika collapses in Jamie’s arms

Dragging Erika Jamie moves as fast as she can to get out of
this hellhole but as she rounds the corner she SCREAMS at-—

The empty spot in the dirt where Johnson used to be
She looks in every direction but he’s nowhere to be found

Moving as fast as she can with Erika Jamie lumbers toward
the DARK PASSAGE to escape when--

Johnson LUNGES out from the DARK CORRIDOR

Jamie and Erika fall to the ground as he lurks over them his
smashed face giving him a monstrous appearance He picks at
his stomach wound with Barton’s gut knife

JOHNSON
Youre gonna stay right

With Alex dead and Erika too crippled to help Jamie knows
she’s on her own She crawls backward away from the incoming
Johnson -- back into the hell of the cave

JOHNSON (CONT’D)
Because I think we can work this
out You don’t have to move

JAMIE
You wanna work this out Scott Is
that what you want
She stops crawling -- relaxes her body

JAMIE (CONTD)
or do you want me

Johnson stops in his tracks -- looks shocked Jamie would say
such a thing

JAMIE (CONTD)

Tell me how long has it been
Scott

(CONT TNIUED

She slides off one of the shoulder-straps on her bikini top

JAMIE (CONTD)
You‘ve been watching me since I was
just a girl havent you

JOHNSON
Don’t do that

JAMIE
Come and get me Scottie Come take
what belongs to you Full circle

Jamie opens her legs ever so slightly -- despite her fear
she’s fighting back -- and notwithstanding the horrible
situation she looks pretty amazing

And it totally unravels Johnson

JOHNSON
Young lady put your clothes on

JAMIE
Make me

Johnson reaches out to GRAB Jamie but he’s not trying to
hurt her he’s trying to put her clothes back on

Jamie wrestles herself free -- her bikini top hanging on by a
single strap now She’s got Johnson just where she wants him

JAMIE (CONTD)
Ive done it before Did you know
that

JOHNSON
You’re lying

JAMIE
Does that make you mad To know
another man’s seen my body

JOHNSON
You’re just a kid

JAMIE
Do I look like one

The other strap comes off her bikini top She’s still covered

but ready for the taking but Jamie knows that will never
happen because

(CONTTNURD )

Johnson belts out a PRIMAL SCREAM and while he unleashes his
frustration by POUNDING his fists into the BOULDER
Jamie continues crawling back into the cave -- near Alex now

JAMIES POV she sees the CORKSCREW from “Desert Rose” poking
out of his pocket

Jamie creeps next to him -- pulls the CORKSCREW and hides it
in her hand as

Johnson stops venting -- his fists look like ground beef as
he turns to Jamie heaving with long deep breaths and

Now that Jamie’s armed she’s ready to end this thing

JAMIE

Can’t get it up can you
JOHNSON

Huh
JAMIE

You can’t be with a woman without
seeing them as a little girl can
you You‘re ashamed Where you hard
when you killed those people

JOHNSON
Shut up
JAMIE
You like boys too
JOHNSON
Enough
JAMIE
Or just little girls
JOHNSON
Stop it
JAMIE
Or is it just me you want Your one-
and-only
JOHNSON

Leave me alone

JAMIE
I think you’re just a soft-cock

(CONTTNIED )

JOHNSON
That’s bullshit

Shes working him now -- still holding the CORKSCREW between
her hand and the dirt as

JAMIE
Prove it Show me what you got

JOHNSON
No

Jamie goes for the jugular -- affecting her body language and
VOICE to sound coquettish

JAMIE
Pretty please Scottie Give it to
me Come fuck me
With that Johnson goes berserk He LUNGES at Jamie and PINS
her to the floor His smashed face inches from hers as he
struggles to get out his pants and just then

Jamie GRIPS the CORKSCREW -- moves to PLUNGE it in Johnson’s
neck -- but she only gets mid-slash before--

Johnson’s meaty hand CATCHES Jamie’s wrist and SLAMS it into
the dirt

ANGLE ON THE CORKSCREW as it flies out of Jamies reach

All the confidence drains from her face as she realizes she
just unleashed a monster and no longer has any defense as

Johnsons strong physique sits on top of Jamie -- PINNING her
down as he writhes around like a wild animal

A tear rolls down her face -- mixing with dirt and blood as
she succumbs in to her fate

With Johnson still struggling to get it up she closes her
eyes knowing death is imminent but suddenly--

Johnson lets out a sound that sounds somewhere between pain
and pleasure Jamie opens her eyes to see--

ERIKA STANDS BEHIND JOHNSON--

Her last bit of energy spent LODGING THE SHOVEL HALF-WAY
THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS NECK

(CONT TNITED 1

Johnson falls over into the dirt as Jamie JUMPS up and
catches Erika who collapses in her arms

Jamie rests Erika against the boulder and the two of them
stare Johnson down

Still alive he’s trying to speak but all we HEAR is the
sound of air coming out of his wind-pipe Too much for Jamie

Without a word she stomps over to Johnson puts her foot on
the edge of the shovel and with a single DIGGING MOTION --
SNAP She severs Johnson’s head from the rest of his body

ANGLE ON the PORCELAIN BALLERINA lying in the dirt as Jamies
hand swipes it away and we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON COVE - BEACH - DAWN

The morning light of a new day shines on Jamie as she lugs
Erika out of the cave system They trudge past the signal
fire which is now just smoking embers to see

“Desert Rose” moored on the beach and

EXT PATROL BOAT - SAME

JAMIES DAD and RANGER LIGHTFOOT speed toward the beach
Shock on their faces as they see Jamie trudging toward them
with Erika in her arms

RANGER COLLINS
Ill be damned

With that a wounded LEE BARTON rises from the back -- a look
of salvation on his face when he sees his daughter and

EXT FORGOTTEN CANYON COVE - BEACH - SAME

From the PORCELAIN BALLERINA clutched in Jamie’s hand we PULL
OUT to see her and Erika fall to their knees at the water’s
edgeand FURTHER OUT to see Jamie’s dad and Barton jump out
of the patrol boat to help their daughtersand FURTHER OUT
to REVEAL a massive lake surrounded by breathtaking cliffs
and beaches and just as we appreciate the serene beauty of
such a safe and remote place we

FADE OUT
