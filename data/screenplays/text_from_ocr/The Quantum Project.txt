I came to take back my picture The one I
keep leaving with you

His heart deflates His voice follows Barely audible

PENTCHO
Why

MIA
So I can move on You too

A horn blares from outside

MIA (CONTD)

the
his

scrolls

Be who you are Paul I love who you are
I do

She turns and runs out the front door

EXT ALEXANDERS HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 55

Mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend WILL holds open
passenger door of the red Durango

MIAS VOICE
Ill drive

She circles the car disappears behind the wheel Will gets in
side
ON THE FRONT PORCH

Pentcho agitated pushes open the door Alexanders already
outside watching Mia motor off He turns stares at his son

ALEXANDER
Do you want to think about it some more

PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB Jumps into the Beetle The
headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night

INT THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT 56
Mia grips the wheel with two hands Will feigns nonchalance

WILL
You okay

She nods Barely They merge onto the highway
INT THE BEETLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT 57
Pentcho grips the wheel Eyes focused We surge into
INT PENTCHOS BRAIN FIELD - OPENING ON 58
PEARLS PLAYING OUT LOOPING INTO A STRING
whose shape recalls the original brain field Thought text
below accompanied now by Pentchos own inner voice
VOICE AND TEXT
Each part of physical reality is constructed
of all the other parts

EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON A SINGLE PEARL

inside of which the entire strand is reflected

to
One
her
seems
as

VOICE AND TEXT (CONTD)

A web of connections created by the

interdependence of all things
The field collapses back into
INT MIA IN THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT 59
eyes on the rear view mirror as a horn BLARES from the entrance
the Long Beach bridge
She re-checks the mirror filled with bobbing headlight beams
beam LOCKS ON straight into the center of the glass blinding
for a split second She blinks Gasps to herself as the beam
to
LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR
and train its phosphorescent glow on

MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP

the point of light reflecting out of her pupils PENTCHOS VOICE
speaks from nowhere sonorous and packed with reverb

PENTCHOS VOICE
What do you want

Mia blinks again The beam is gone She looks over at WILL
oblivious checking his watch

BACK ON MIA
the understanding flooding her eyes as
SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER)

And we see her making her move from FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES
from her left right up above and from the back seat of the car

the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY

POV MIA THE BRIDGE THE CARS THE BAY

all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but

THE VOID NOTHINGNESS NADA CRASH

INT THE DURANGO (SLAMMING INTO THE CAR AHEAD) - NIGHT 60

triggering a chain reaction of vehicles fish-tailing across the
bridge In quick succession come a STREAM OF IMAGES
The pearls colliding

Mia and Will exchanging a LOOK

Traffic HALTING on the bridge

Will getting SCORCHED by the MAN they plowed into
Mia exiting her side looking BACK BEHIND HER
PENTCHO ditching his Beetle ten car lengths south

HE RUNS FORWARD straight down the path of a tunnel-like

headlight

beam

MIA PICKS UP SPEED churning from the other direction

PULL BACK FROM THE BRIDGE

as the two of them move toward the same point Suddenly tiny
sparks

of light GLOW and JUMP from portions of the bridge cable

SLOW MOTION PENTCHO AND MIA

gliding still closer A VOICE sounds

VOICE
Impact

Their bodies CONNECT arms intertwine lips touch lips

PULL BACK - HIGHER

Its like a plug in the socket of the physical landscape

LIGHTING THE ENTIRE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM

Every cell line radio wave satellite feed fiber-optic cable
all

stretching in every possible direction
FROM BRIDGE TO SEA TO SKY

pulsing outward into a spidery network of
GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS

THE END
