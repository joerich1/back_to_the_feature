5th Draft of the Final Draft

November 4 2008
EXT BAYOU SWAMPS - MISSISSIPPI- DAY

In the midst of a few idyllic shots of the bayou-

A FRIGHTENED BUCK

appears before us A thing of beauty Exquisite Now

A BLAST BAM

And the buck drops out of the frame

The buck lies on the dirt ground Not dead Shot in the
leg He struggles to stand up Shaking Heartbreaking
Barely on its feet Then

BAM

The buck is shot in another leg He collapses to the ground
A group of FOUR HUNTERS comes upon the tortured animal their
high-powered rifles slung along their backs The only man
we can see clearly is CHARLIE VENNER 27 Grizzled athletic
handsome He holds his rifle in front of him He’s the only

one not holding a beer

HUNTER 1 (BIC)
Goddamn perfect Charlie

Charlie looks almost adoringly at the buck that now seems to
be chirping in last-throes-of-life agony

Hunter number two (NORMAN) unsheathes a knife bends down
gets ready to amputate the buck’s antlers

CHARLIE
Hold on

Venner aims Shoots the buck through the heart

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Now
(shakes his head)
Drunk-ass motherfuckers

Norman bends back down and gets to work The men look upon
the bloody chore One of them (CHRIS) takes out a beer and
starts to guzzle Charlie turns away and starts to head to
their truck This kind of work is beneath him

CUT TO
EXT BACKROADS HALF AN HOUR LATER

Charlie and his crew roar down the road in their FORD F-350
with jacked up suspension ZZ Top’s “I’m Bad I’m Nationwide”
blasts The men hoot and cheer all except Charlie who sits
quietly On the front of the truck is hinged

THE ANTLERS from their “kill”

PUSH IN on those antlers until they FILL THE FRAME

SMASH CUT TO

SHOT OF THE FAMOUS JAGUAR HOOD ORNAMENT

PULL BACK to reveal---

EXT PAVED HIGHWAY DAY

A Jaguar XK convertible zips along the tree-lined inlets and
swampy eddies of this Southern Mississippi River Delta
country The slick car looks out of place among the rusty
pick ups and rows of hurricane damaged houses

Driving is DAVID SUMNER 30 handsome educated well to do
Next to him is his wife AMY a few years younger A knockout

“JUMPING JACK FLASH” roars from the perfect sound system
Now the Jag passes a sign-

BLACKWATER MISSISSIPPI - HOME OF THE BLACK KNIGHTS
(population 7730)

David tries to speak over the song
DAVID
Seven thousand seven hundred and

thirty-two

But Amy can’t make out what he’s saying She points to her
ears Speak up

DAVID (CONT’D)
I said

David turns down the radio

DAVID (CONT’D)
Home sweet home
AMY
(forced smile)
Home sweet home

The Jag passes by small homes and storefronts
It passes by an isolated yellow church

It passes by a football field where high school boys smash up
on one another with tremendous violence

Amy gazes upon her old hometown with a knowing distance

Now the Jag passes a large lumbering man JEREMY NILES He
walks down the street with a cane and a mutt by his side
Several children run behind himthey take turns tagging him
and running awaya kind of odd game

Amy looks back at Niles and the children concerned

EXT BLACKIE’S BLACKWATER BOWLING ALLEY DAY

The Jaguar is parked in the dirt lot in front of a rustic
bowling alley A cursive “BLACKIE’S” is painted on the side
of the building

INT BLACKIE’S BLACKWATER BOWLING ALLEY DAY

Amy and David sit at a rickety table at the old style alley
probably not refurbished since the sixties At the back of
the joint is a bar Pool tables and a jukebox are also in
evidence Only one person is actually bowling Everybody
else is drinking eating or just congregating As they eat
their chili sirloin burgers David and Amy take this all in

AMY
Not exactly Musso and Frank’s

DAVID
Yeah but it’s great It’s just
great This is the joint huh

AMY
More than a joint It’s where the
problems of the world are solved

DAVID
Problems of the world
AMY
The Blackwater world
(beat)
You have a chili mustache

Indeed David has a chili mustache He looks adorably
ridiculous He laughs at himself

DAVID
Impossible Nobody who has ever
been first in his class at Yale has
ever had a “chili mustache”

She hands him a napkin

AMY
You’re breaking new ground then

David wipes away the chili points to her half eaten burger

DAVID
Is that all you’re going to eat
You’ve been reminiscing forever
about chowing down on “Blackie’s
Super-Sized Chili Monster”

AMY
“Chili Sirloin Monster” And that’s
when I was seventeen Today I
think I’ve gained five pounds just
looking at it

Amy picks up a fried pickle from the middle of the table

AMY (CONT’D)
Now if you really want to be a
local

David shakes his head “No”

AMY (CONTD)
C’mon Have a little courage
“Fried pickly” It’s step one to
fitting in

David holds the pickle

DAVID
Now thisthis is disgusting

CHARLIE (0C)
Not with a little blue cheese
dressin’ it ain’t
And with that Charlie Venner our lead hunter from the

opening scene confidently stands behind David who has to

bend his neck around to see him

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Hello Amy-cakes

And takes a good look here- because Amy’s entire demeanor

changes She becomes cold stand-offish

AMY
Hello Charlie

David takes in their odd exchange

CHARLIE
I heard you were back
(beat)
Youre lookin’ alright for

yourself Ain’t changed much Not

as much as I’d have thought

Amy doesn’t feel much like yapping but nonetheless-

AMY
This is my husband David

Charlie looks down at David Not terribly impressed

CHARLIE
I’m Charlie Venner

David grips Charlie’s hand firmly

DAVID
David Sumner

CHARLIE

Yeah I put a bid in for me and my

crew to rebuild that roof

DAVID

Oh yeah Right Venner Right

CHARLIE
We do good work You can ask Amy
(turns to Amy)
Chris and Bic and Norm and I been
doin’ lotta work since the storm

AMY
Ill bet
CHARLIE
We went up to your place after the
hurricane hit just to see It got
busted up pretty bad the barn did
But I think we can have it up for
you in three weeks or so

DAVID
Terrific We’re gonna stick around
for a while until I finish my work
Eventually we’re going to sell the
place so we need to get it in tip
top shape

AMY
A year at the most but-

CHARLIE
(to David)
Rumor is you’re a movie director or
something

AMY
Davids a writer

DAVID
(smiles)
She means I work for a living

CHARLIE
(knocking on the table)
Let’s hear it for the working
class
(beat)
You working on anything
interesting

AMY
Davids writing a movie about
Stalingrad Where the Russians
defeated the Germans

DAVID
(correcting)
The Nazis
(beat)
Biggest battle in history Turned
the war around

CHARLIE
No Americans in that one though
Right
Before David can answer (the answer is correct by the way)
a waitress ABBY walks over with the check

ABBY
That’s 1250 honey

CHARLIE
Bet you can’t get two burgers and
two cokes for 1250 In Los
Angeles

DAVID
That’s a bet you’d win

CHARLIE
And nowhere near as tasty huh

David hands over his credit card to Abby

DAVID
Nowhere close

ABBY
Cash only honey

DAVID
Cash

ABBY
What poor people use for money

David smiles That was a good one He takes out his wallet
and hands her some cash

DAVID
Keep the change

David looks over at the bar
DAVID (CONTD)
I’m actually going to grab a beer
(to Charlie)
You want one

Charlie shakes his head “no” David stands

DAVID (CONT’D)
Can you begin working tomorrow

CHARLIE
First thing
DAVID
Let’s do it What the hell If
youre a friend of Amy’s-

CHARLIE
Beautiful

AMY
Great

David heads toward the bar Charlie watches him walk away

CHARLIE
Nice catch Amy-cakes

AMY
(coldly)
He’s a good man

CHARLIE
Hard to imagine he’s anything but

ANGLE- BAR

As David approaches he notices that BLACKIE the bartender is
tending to another customer This is

TOM HEDDON a well built man in his late forties already
drunk sits at the bar with a mug of beer He looks over at
David Notices his Converse sneakers with no strings

David nods to Heddon who responds with the hint of a smile
In the BG we see that the other hunters from earlier in the
film are all playing pool This is Charlie’s crew They are

all about the same age

NORMAN- Tall strong and athletic He has been number two to
Charlie all his life and still is

BIC- Heavy and awkward and if its possible the dummy of
the bunch He wears thick glasses

CHRIS- Lanky - a meth fiend - always amped up and drunk

Also quietly observing once in a while looking at his watch
is a slightly older man named DANIEL

Norman looks over at Amy and Charlie - takes note of them
We can see a bitterness fueled in him

ANGLE- AMY AND CHARLIE
Charlie reaches over and snatches one of Amy’s fries

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
You mind

Amy pushes her whole plate over

AMY
Help yourself

Charlie finally sits

CHARLIE
To be honest none of us thought
you’d ever make it back

AMY
Well David wanted a quiet place to
work And we have to sell the
place

CHARLIE
Yeah That’s what your husband
said Sorry about your daddy

AMY
Thank you

CHARLIE
I saw you on that show um--

AMY
“Battleship”

CHARLIE
I guess that’s the “big time” you
were looking for when you hauled
ass outta here
(beat)
That and your “good man”

Amy doesn’t respond She looks out the window She sees
Niles lumber toward the bowling alley The dog is with him

AMY
(re Niles)
I thought Jeremy Niles was supposed
to be put away a long time ago

CHARLIE
We take care of our own here

Charlie moves his hand to her shoulder

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Remember when I took care of you

AMY
(cold)
But you didn’t Did you

Charlie moves his hands on the small of her head Strokes
her hair Amy moves away forcing his hand off of her head

AMY (CONT’D)
Don’t touch me

David observes this - takes it in He’s more curious than
alarmed He has no clue about his wife’s past At all

David looks up at some photos on the wall All of them
related to local high school football One of the photos
shows Charlie and his crew AND Amy and a couple of other
girls in cheerleading outfits Amy has a big “B” pendant on
her outfit David smiles to himself

BLACKIE the bartender walks up

BLACKIE
Hey

DAVID
Hey

BLACKIE

(looking at Amy)
You’re the new husband

DAVID
(smiling)
The proud new husband-

Tom Heddon is taking in the conversation

DAVID (CONT’D)
You have anything on tap

BLACKIE
Coors

DAVID
Coors Lite it is then

As Blackie goes over to the tap-

BLACKIE
I said we had Coors Fully loaded

DAVID
(smiling)
That’1l be fine

TOM HEDDON
I think I’d like another Blackie

BLACKIE
Why don’t we hold off coach

Blackie moves to take Heddon’s glass mug but Heddon quickly
wraps his beefy hands around Blackie’s A firm grip David
looks upon the standoff

Heddon’s grip gets tighter

BLACKIE (CONT’D)
C’mon Tom Don’t be like that

And now the glass SHATTERS in their hands David winces at
this small violent act Tom’s hand has a small cut

Charlie walks over Puts his hand on Tom’s shoulder

CHARLIE
What do you say we call it a day
Coach Let’s go over to practice
Give those kids some shit

Heddon isn’t paying attention He has a foolish grin

TOM HEDDON
Sorry about that Blackie I’11
pay for the glass and uh
(re David)
I’ll pay for our new neighbor’s
beer-

DAVID
Oh that’s okay---

Heddon is not used to having his hospitality turned down

TOM HEDDON
Ill pay for your drink
(back to Blackie)
But Blackie I want another beer

BLACKIE
(cold)
Don’t think so-

Tom violently LEAPS over the bar throwing Charlie backward
Tom grabs a mug and pours himself a drink When it is full
he raises the mug to David Then to the rest of the crowd A
Trophy Charlie’s crew cheers him on from the pool table
VOICE
All right coach Why don’t you
pay for your drink and go home

The voice belongs to JOHN BURKE the town sheriff a man
roughly Charlie’s age Tom looks over at John Smiles

TOM HEDDON
Okay then Sheriff

He downs the drink He lays ten dollars on the bar

TOM HEDDON (CONT’D)
My drink and his

Heddon then moves with whatever pride a drunk man can muster
out of the bowling alley As he does he nods to David

Blackie gives David his beer

BLACKIE
It’s been paid for

David leaves some money on the counter

DAVID
It has now

He nods to Charlie “See you tomorrow” Amy gets up with
him and walks out
EXT BLACKIE’S BLACKWATER BOWLING ALLEY DAY
Amy and David head out of the alley
DAVID
Is that what you meant by “problems
of the world”
AMY
That’s just Coach Heddon Not the

prettiest picture in the world

David seems more amused than alarmed

DAVID
Ah it’s all good - just part of
Blackwater’s charming
(looks for the word)
“eccentricity”

AMY
What a way with words You should
try writing for a living

DAVID
Brilliant idea

Now they notice - NILES is sitting in the front seat of the
Jag his hands on the steering wheel pretending to drive

Kids run around the car making fun of Nilestaunting
him Again he seems absolutely oblivious to all of it

AMY
Let me deal with it okay

Amy makes a beeline for the car The kids scatter

AMY (CONTD)
Hi Jeremy

And she says that with a lot of tenderness love even At
this point we realize that while Niles may be slow - he is
also a very handsome man

NILES
Hello Amy

AMY
How are you

NILES
I’m driving

AMY
I see Can I drive for a while

Niles looks over at her Smiles She returns the smile
Niles sheepishly gets out of the car From behind them comes
DANIEL He’s Niles’ brother

DANIEL
Cmon then Jeremy Let’s go home

NILES
For lunch

DANIEL
Yes Let’s get some lunch
(to Amy)
Welcome back Amy You look

terrific
Amy smiles at him gently

AMY
Thank you Daniel

Niles and Daniel walk away together When they are a few
yards away Niles’ dog leaps out from the backseat and chases
after him

DAVID
We should make you ambassador to
the United Nations

AMY
Nah those people aren’t smart
enough for me

David looks at the backseat notices a gift left to him by
the dog Damn

DAVID
Can we get some towels or
newspapers or something

David looks at Niles lumbering away He then notices Charlie
and several townspeople have gathered to witness this Tom
Heddon is one of them

EXT ROADS DAY

Amy drives pedal to the metal She laughs David grins He
can’t help but be amused himself

DAVID
It’s not funny Somebody’s gonna
have to pay for that

AMY

Well it’s not gonna be Jeremy
Niles

They come to a fork in the road Amy swerves a hard left

DAVID
So that guy-

AMY
Which guy

DAVID
“Amy-cakes” guy Charlie Our new
contractor I saw the two of you in
a photo You were in your
cheerleader uniform

AMY
I can get it out of storage if you
want

DAVID

You used to see him right
No answer

DAVID (CONT’D)
(grinning)
Right

AMY
A couple of times

DAVID
Couple of times

Now Amy has a little wicked smirk on her face

DAVID (CONT’D)
Cmon just a couple of times

AMY
Well they may have been memorable

Amy screeches the car to a halt She unbuckles herself
scoots over to David She starts to rub on him

AMY (CONTD)
Are you jealous

DAVID
Hey baby who’s the guy that got
the girl in the end
And with that Amy really gets into it

DAVID (CONT’D)
You’re nuts

David opens the car door and jokingly runs away from the car
He comes over the crest

AND THERE IT IS
Grand and beautiful- It almost looks like a fort
Here we have the WILCOX HOME Which is now the SUMNER HOME

A two story structure made of stone The windows are high and
small as though the original builders begrudged every inch
that didn’t give the original inhabitants some kind of
massive protection The doors are made out of cast iron

DAVID (CONT’D)
My God

AMY
(driving next to him)
What do you think

DAVID
I think it’s just beautiful

Amy nods Beautiful it is

DAVID (CONT’D)
A lot of history here

AMY
That’s putting it mildly

David looks to his right Next to the home is a large wooden
barn with a roof caved in David moves toward it Amy drives
the car toward the front of the house

INT BARN DAY
David stands inside the barn It is devastated Amy walks in

AMY
It’s worse than I thought

DAVID
(putting on a good face)
We’re going to fix it up better
than it ever was - make this joint
even more valuable

AMY
I hope so

DAVID
Yeah yeah It’1l be fine It
will The architecture is totally
different from the main house

AMY
My dad constructed the barn on his
own The house was built during
the Civil War It was a fort Built
for high ranking officers

David smiles at her He’s impressed

DAVID
We’re getting something like 8K in
FEMA money

AMY
82 K

DAVID
That’s a bit more than Charlie bid -
maybe we can give him the balance

AMY
Why would we do that

DAVID
To help out your friends

Amy puts her arms around David’s shoulders She admires his
good intentions

AMY
Baby Charlie and the boys don’t
need help They need work You
can spend the balance on your
adoring wife

INT SUMNER HOME TRACKING SHOT
Amy wanders the house - her house - the one of her childhood -
a place she has been away from for years Every room she

passes seems to bring back memories Now she hears loud-

ZYDECO MUSIC she follows it into the

INT LIVING ROOM DAY

Where David having discovered an old style record player
plays a vinyl record David gives her a big grin

He’s getting a kick out of the music When he sees Amy he
sways his hips a bit-

AMY
You found my parents’ Zydeco
collection

DAVID
Your parents were pretty cool cats

She takes the needle off the album It’s not an aggressive
move per se but David notices that the music has provoked a

simmering something within her

DAVID (CONT’D)
I think Ill stick to Ludwig Van
while I work

AMY
Thank God

David looks at the books on the shelves and the decorative
Civil War era rifles mounted on the wall

DAVID
Your dad loved to study the Civil
War huh
AMY
My mom actually Me too
DAVID
Yeah
AMY
Yeah

Now David’s attention is diverted to a MOUNTED DEER

AMY (CONT’D)
I remember when daddy got that
deer When he put up that trophy we
had a huge party Like he had won
the Super Bowl or something

Leaning up against the wall is a huge BEAR TRAP

DAVID
Did he get him with that

AMY
That’d be some kind of overkill

With that we hear the sound of a truck out front The moving
van has arrived

EXT SUMNER HOME A FEW HOURS LATER DUSK

Amy waves to the movers as they leave

INT SUMNER HOME A MINUTE LATER

Amy moves through the house which is now LOADED UP WITH
BOXES She walks into the study where

INT STUDY SAME TIME

David furiously types This seems to be the one room where
everything is well organized Behind David is a BLACKBOARD
with his entire “STALINGRAD” script is neatly outlined

All over the walls are maps charts photos from Stalingrad -
the greatest battle ever fought David is so engrossed that

he does not notice Amy She walks to the blackboard Looks

at the end of outline It says “February 1943”

Without David noticing she erases it with her sleeve and
writes “1944”

She plops herself down in a large armchair David looks up at
her Smiles Goes back to work After a few seconds he
notices her still there

DAVID
Ill bet that was your daddy’s
chair

AMY

(wry smile)
Every chair was my daddy’s chair

David talks as he continues to type

DAVID
I - uh - am being hit with a moment
of inspiration I found- I figured
a way to get Khruschev right in the
action- I’m making him a friend of
Yuri’s

AMY
Khruschev was in Stalingrad

DAVID
A hero in Stalingrad
(smiling)
Stick with me kid and you’1l learn
something new everyday

AMY
I knew I didn’t marry you just for
your looks

David gets up and walks to the blackboard -

DAVID
I’m going to put him right here -
right before the third act At the
time of the liberation Good place
to surprise the audiencejust
like you were right now see

AMY
Great Now you want to take a
break and start unpacking the boxes
for the rest of the house

DAVID
Just gimme a bit okay Let me
just finish off this scene

AMY
Okay I just thought-

DAVID
(justifying)
It’s an important moment in an
important screenplay Amy- it’s
history you know I gotta write
it when it hits me

AMY
The great thing about history
David is that it’1ll still be there
once we’re done unpacking

David steps away from the computer and walks over to her He
gets into the big chair with her He gently moves some hair
from in front of her eyes

DAVID
I’m happy we came

AMY
Are you sure

DAVID
Hey whose idea was this anyway
To come here

Amy smiles quietly It was his idea
AMY

I’m just worried it’1l all be too
quiet for you Too boring

DAVID
Quiet’s what I want Boring even
more

AMY

Well if you’re happy I’m happy

David looks over at blackboard He sees Amy’s change to the
outline He shakes his head Goes to the board He rewrites
1943

DAVID
Didn’t think I’d catch that did
you

Out of nowhere FLUTEY THE CAT leaps up on the counter next
to David This takes David TOTALLY by surprise

DAVID (CONT’D)
Jesus

Amy snatches up Flutey and faces him

AMY
Flutey I was wondering when you’d
show up Isn’t he adorable

DAVID
(all shaken up)
Yup

AMY
A real sweetheart

DAVID
Tell that to the mice

AMY
Probably hasn’t had a real meal
since my daddy died

Amy starts to walk out of the room cradling the cat
AMY (CONTD)
Let’s get you some milk

INT BLACKIE’S BLACKWATER BOWLING ALLEY NIGHT

Charlie’s crew is playing pool with gusto Right now CHRIS
has a pool cue in his hand dancing around the table as he
tries to figure out his next shot He’s playing and dancing

in rhythm to “Eminence Front” by The Who

Charlie smokes a cigarette and watches the game coldly

Daniel is having a quiet beer
Chris takes a shot Misses

CHRIS
Ooooooow

NORMAN
How much they payin’ us

CHARLIE
Enough

BAM Norman makes the shot Gets ready for another

CHRIS
Ain’t no such thing as “enough”
these days

NORMAN
Those two probably can afford to
pay us plenty Plenty’s what I

need

CHARLIE
Well we’re all gonna get what we
deserve

Into the bar walks Deputy John Burke Tom Heddon
been observing the game takes notice

CHRIS
Man Amy’s looking good though
ain’t she Don’t remember them
tits quite like that What do you
think Norm that husband of hers
put out some titty bucks

one

who has

That line ignites Norman almost like it’s a personal slight

CHRIS (CONT’D)
Bet that’s how she got on that
show

Norman knocks in the nine-ball Game over He grabs two
twenty dollar bills from the edge of the table

NORMAN
Who’s next

Nobody answers for a few seconds John Burke grabs a cue

JOHN BURKE
Twenty

NORMAN
Twenty’s fine

John starts to rack them up

Now Tom speaks to Daniel - but he speaks loudly enough for
Sheriff Burke’s ears

TOM HEDDON
Daniel-

Daniel continues eating doesn’t look at Heddon

TOM HEDDON (CONT’D)
Your brother

DANIEL
What of him

TOM HEDDON
Your little brother was hangin’
round the girls today Again
Youd better keep a closer watch on
him

And now directly intended for Burke -

TOM HEDDON (CONT’D)
Shouldn’t be our job to mind him

Daniel continues drinking
DANIEL

He wasn’t doing anything wrong He
was just playin’ with ‘ema little

NORMAN
A little’s too much for that sort
(beat)
We aren’t gonna stand for it You
keep him away from the girls or we
will

John is concentrating on “The break” Before he does -

JOHN BURKE
No need for that tone Norm
TOM HEDDON
Danny’s just bein’ told the truth
is all-
DANIEL
(calm)
If my brother ever makes a mistake
in any way Ill put him away

You have my word But until then
let him be He’s not doing any
harm

And CRACK John Burke shoots and breaks The game is on
Heddon looks on with a cool anger at Burke - wondering why he
did not take his side in the exchange

EXT SUMNER HOUSE MORNING

The next morning The sun peaks out over the horizon Ina
LONGSHOT - a truck arrives Four men pour out of it

INT BEDROOM MORNING

RRRRROOOOAAAAARRRR

David sits up in shock almost as if he had been prompted out
of his sleep by a nightmare Amy also wakes up

DAVID
Jesus

David goes to the window and pulls the drapes aside Charlie
and his crew are on the roof working laughing it up David
opens the window Charlie waves to him

CHARLIE

David timidly waves back He closes the curtain Amy pulls
the pillow over her head

AMY

DAVID

CHARLIE

DAVID
Hold on

David starts to climb the ladder It’s wobbly The men
watch slightly amused as David gets to the roof trying to
maintain his bearings looking slightly silly in his robe

CHARLIE
Woah there

DAVID

Charlie holds onto the ladder

INT KITCHEN DAY

David is at the kitchen table having a sandwich He is going
over some of his notes FLUTEY THE CAT leaps up on the table
Snuggles up next to him David gently pushes the cat away
The cat returns Purrs This time David adds a little
aggression to the shove

Now David senses something Somebody behind him perhaps

He turns around Bic is there opening up the refrigerator
David is alarmed but keeps his cool

DAVID
Hey

Bic pulls out a beer Examines it

BIC

Bic grabs a few more beers and walks out
Amy sits down She puts her legs up on the table her feet

right in front of David She starts playfully poking at him
with her toes David is reading doesn’t look up -

DAVID
You’re worse than the cat

AMY
Is that all he’s going to be to
you “The Cat” His name’s Flutey
And he’s a part of the family

DAVID
I think it’s best if Flutey and I
don’t get too attached

Amy grabs a banana from the middle of the table She eats
provocatively Stares at David who is having a hard time
concentrating

DAVID (CONT’D)
Your friends do things like that a
lot

AMY
Do things like what a lot

DAVID
Like walking in uninvited and
grabbing beers

AMY

Why don’t you just chalk it up to
“Blackwater’s charming
eccentricities”

(grinning)
We don’t even lock our doors here
We all trust each other It’s the
one thing I do miss

DAVID
Well if that’s the way it is then
that’s the way it is

Amy feels he doesn’t believe what he’s saying

AMY
It’s your house now baby Just
tell it to them like it is
(beat)
If you’re comfortable with that

And that last line felt almost like a challenge

EXT SUMNER FARM DAY

Charlie and his gang load up the truck They’re each downing
David’s beers David looks at his watch It is only noon

DAVID
Excuse me Charlie Can I borrow
you for a moment

Charlie moves over to David

CHARLIE
What’s up Mr Sumner
DAVID

CHARLIE

As Charlie turns to leave -

DAVID
Look uh if you don’t mind- I’m
fine with your guys helping
themselves to some beers-

CHARLIE
Thanks by the way For the beer

DAVID
No problem It’s just that Bic just
walked straight into the house

CHARLIE
Shit Has Bic given you reason not
to trust him or something

DAVID
No

CHARLIE
Well let me know if that happens
and Ill deal with it
(looks at watch)
We have to get going Sorry ‘bout
all the noise this morning It
won’t happen again

David nods Charlie gets into the truck The Ford screeches
away As David stands in its dust the truck turns around and
comes back toward David Charlie rolls down his window

NOTE In the BG we hear (and will hear every time Charlie’s
car is present) the crackling of a POLICE SCANNER

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Hey Do you want to come hunting
with us Mr Sumner The white
tails really run this time of year

DAVID
No Thank you I have to work

BIC
Charlie nailed one the other day

DAVID
Sounds great But I really have to
write It’s why we’re here after
all

Amy walks up and settles behind David She takes his hand- it
almost seems as if she does it for Charlie’s consumption
She then gives David a good hard kiss

AMY
(to David)
Hey baby

CHARLIE
Ya know lotta great writers came
outta the South Faulkner
Tennessee Williams Grisham-

DAVID
Read ‘em all
Charlie looks over at Amy with a smile

CHARLIE
Bet it wasn’t Amy’s idea to come
live here She had that bus
schedule memorized oh ‘bout
freshman year

AMY
Do you blame me

Charlie just grins and then turns to David

CHARLIE
Well if you ever want to come
huntin’ with us just say the word

DAVID
Okay Thank you I may take you up
on that

The truck takes off again
AMY
You might take them up on

“hunting”

DAVID
Just showing some respect Amy

AMY
Did you talk to them about Bic

DAVID
Yes I did

AMY
And

DAVID

I think they get it

INT TRUCK DAY
Bic pulls out a pair of panties from his pants

BIC
Look familiar

Chris snatches the panties Lays them over his face He
breathes in Chris and Bic laugh

CHRIS
(handing them to Norman)
This’1ll be as close as you’ll ever
have come

NORMAN
Fuck off

Charlie grabs the panties He throws them out the window

CHARLIE
You’re a buncha fucking juvies ya
know that

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Amy is sitting in bed A chessboard sits in front of her She
is reading a book about chess strategy David comes in from
brushing his teeth

AMY
It’s your move

David walks over looks at the board and makes a move

DAVID
Check

Amy looks at the board Confused She goes back to the
book Reads to herself

AMY
“This move now puts black into a
desperate flight with no
possibility of mobilizing his
disorganized pieces Two pawns
down white can conveniently use-”

DAVID
(interrupting)
I’11l tell you what I’11 bet that
I can finish my exercises before
you can make your next move

AMY
(grinning)
You’re on

DAVID
Put the book down No help
AMY
You should be encouraging my
education

DAVID
Down

David grabs a jump rope and goes at it - really at it
Amy scans the board Her eyes light up

AMY
I got it

With that David drops the jump rope and leaps into bed

AMY (CONT’D)
You’re supposed to do one hundred

DAVID
I was counting by binary numbers

Amy makes a move David shakes his head “No”

AMY
What

DAVID
That’1l put you into check

Amy looks over the board She makes another move

DAVID (CONT’D)
The knight can’t move straight up
It goes in an “L” shape remember

AMY
Why do they call it a knight when
it’s really a horse
(off David’s laugh)
Are you laughing at me

DAVID
I’m laughing with you I actually
don’t know the answer to that one

AMY
That’s a first
(lays the king down)
I surrender

Amy starts to nibble on David’s chest

AMY (CONTD)
in every way

DAVID
A much better prize then when I won
the Fairfield chess Championships

David picks up one of the chess pieces A Knight We see it
but Amy does not His hand goes below her waist

DAVID (CONT’D)
Rook or knight

AMY
(grins)
That’s the horse slash knight

DAVID
Not bad Close your eyes

David lifts up a queen Puts his hand below her waist

AMY
Hmm That’s the queen

DAVID
Very good We should make this a
reality series

AMY
Id finally have a hit

David now picks up a PAWN

DAVID
What’s that

AMY
Hmmm Is that you

She starts to laugh He laughs but just for a second

Now David gets serious

He wants her But first he goes through a ritual He takes
off his watch Then he moves to the alarm clock Sets it
Amy observes this patiently

Now he’s ready

He straddles her Gazes upon her He pulls off his shirt He
wants her And she wants him

EXT DIRT ROAD DAY

Amy runs at a powerful clip Her IPOD is tuned to the DIXIE
CHICKS For the first time we get a sense of her
athleticism She is dressed in shorts and a tank top She is
not wearing a bra She is running barefoot

From behind her comes Charlie’s truck Amy does not notice
because the music is playing loudly

The truck slows down behind her At first we think that it
is sinister But then we go INTO the truck and see the POV
of Norman and the guys which is

Amy’s fantastic bum They are transfixed

CHARLIE
Let’s go you fucking Neanderthals

Norman snorts and hits the gas They pass her Amy shakes her
head as they hoot and holler at her

INT STUDY SAME TIME

David wanders the room looks over the outline makes small
adjustments Ludwig Van is playing Loud Out the window
he notices Charlie and the gang arriving David looks up at
the clock It is about eleven in the morning

EXT DIRT ROAD DAY

Amy continues running Something catches her eye Something
pink She bends over to pick it up Her panties She
angrily balls it up into her fist and continues on

EXT SUMNER FARM DAY

Amy arrives out of breath sweating hard

She looks up to the roof of the barn where she catches all
the men- again excluding Charlie- ogling her She takes the
panties she found and throws them in the workers’ trash bin

Aggressively Making a point to the men

This gets the immature Chris and Bic laughing

INT KITCHEN DAY

David is having a cup of coffee and reading the local paper
Flutey leaps up on the table David pushes the cat away

Amy enters She claps her hands together She’s upset

AMY
Let’s go Flutey
(beat)
Are you taking a break

DAVID
Hard to work with all that noise
They arrived pretty late your
friends Around eleven

AMY
(a bit of anger)
They’1l be done soon I hope

David doesn’t notice Amy’s apparent frustrations He has a
big smirk holds out newspaper

DAVID
The nation’s at war There was an
earthquake in Japan The lead story
is that the first game of the high
school football season is a week
away

AMY
Well Blackwater’s not at war
Though it was a big deal when John
Burke came back from Iraq

DAVID
(dripping with irony)
You and Deputy Burke Returning
heroes

AMY
(cynical)
Here in the South heroes come from
one place That football field

DAVID
Like the men fixing our roof

Amy nods Just like those assholes fixing our roof
DAVID (CONT’D)
It’s sad Bunch of straw dogs

AMY
“Straw dogs”

DAVID

(beat)
In ancient Chinese rituals dogs
made out of straw were used as
offerings to the gods During the
ritual they were treated with the
utmost reverence When it was over
and they were no longer needed they
were trampled on and tossed aside
They become nothing

(beat)
When their football careers are
over that’s all these kids become
Straw dogs

Amy doesn’t say anything She seems pissed off

DAVID (CONT’D)
What Don’t take it personally
I’m not saying “you” You aren’t
like them Not anymore anyway

AMY
No that’s not it It’s just The
“straw dogs” were checking me out -
they’re practically licking my body
out there

DAVID
I applaud their good taste

AMY
It’s not funny David---

DAVID
Look maybe If you wore a bra

AMY
What are you saying that I’m
asking for this

DAVID
Ames c’mon You are redefining
“putting words in my mouth”
(says this carefully)
(MORE )

DAVID(CONTD)

It’s justif you were a bit more
modest you might be looked at with
more respect

AMY
Is that right

David turns Ludwig Van back on
AMY (CONTD)
I should put a bra on That’s how
I can get some respect
DAVID
(shrugging)
“Reaping and sowing” and all that
AMY
(cold)
I’m taking a bath
David is not aware that Amy is put off
DAVID
I guess I should try to work
INT BATHROOM DAY

Amy enters the bathroom The shades are up and she can see
out to the roof where the crew is working

Amy runs the bath Close on the ritual

She lays out the towel

She puts the bar of soap on the sill

She selects her shampoo

The last thing she does is open the door

She lets the robe drop

She gets into the water Lays back

The men look at her Nothing is left to the imagination

Then non-chalantly She pulls down the shades

EXT ROOF DAY

As the men work they hear Ludwig Van emanating from Davids
study

Chris looks over at Charlie
CHRIS
(Re Amy)

That shit ain’t right
BIC

Well Chris if that ain’t right

then I don’t know what right is
CHRIS

That musta been some of “that” when

you had some of that huh

Charlie does not answer he just continues hammering---

CHRIS (CONT’D)
Must’ve been something huh Norm

Norman does not answer either Charlie as if he were doing
battle with Ludwig Van turns up the country music on their
radio

We go CLOSE---

On the incessant and hard driving hammering by Charlie

INT STUDY DAY
David’s fingers hammer away at the computer
David stops typing Looks at the screen He turns it off

Charlie’s country music is seeping in from the outside

EXT SUMNER HOUSE DAY

Charlie and the crew are packing up and ready to go David
comes out of the house He has his car keys in his hands

CHARLIE
Knocking off a bit early if you
don’t mind The heat and all Mr
Sumner

NORMAN
Hot even for here Must be that
global warmin’ you educated guys
always talkin’ ‘bout back there

CHRIS
Bic was getting woozy

BIC
Don’t mean to be a pussy or
nuthin’ but it can get dangerous
up there
(laughs)
Sometimes I think Blackwater’s got
its own sun

CHARLIE
It’s a liability thing Got to
look out for my men

DAVID
No problem Just as long as the
job gets done in the time we
agreed

CHARLIE
Course You goin’ into town

David heads toward his car
DAVID
Cell phone doesn’t work up here and

I have to make some calls

CHARLIE
Pain in the ass right

The men pile into the truck
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Best reception is right by
Blackie’s Alley
They take off SCREECH OFF IN FACT

David puts on his sunglasses He’s about to get into his Jag
when sensing something he looks up and sees

AMY looking down from the bedroom window He gives her a
small wave which she returns - but a kind of uncomfortable
coldness has come between them

EXT BLACKWATER ROADS DAY
David drives the Jag at SIXTY-PLUS When he

Comes up against CHARLIE’S TRUCK - almost slamming into it
He has to slow down dramatically In the back of the truck
are Bic and Chris

David goes really slow now Impatient He can’t pass because
the road is a bit too winding and narrow for him to see past

But now
From the driver’s seat Norman signals David to pass

DAVID
Finally

As soon as he passes them a fast moving TRUCK comes
furiously toward him

David SWERVES and

SLAMS into a ditch

Charlie’s truck races by

David catches his breath He looks up and sees

Bic and Chris laugh their asses off in the back of the truck

He gets back on the road Just barely blinking an eye he
continues driving into town

EXT HANK’S GAS AND GOODS STATION DAY

A gas station attendant LARRY is filling up David’s car
David is on the phone with his agent

DAVID

Aaron if you say not to worry I’m
not going to worry- but it’s not
like I don’t need the money

(beat)
If Amy gets an audition then that
makes sense We’1ll fly in - but
her agent told her not to count on
anything until pilot season and
that’s months from now

(beat)
Im going to need a few weeks

ACROSS THE STREET- David notices Niles The local kids
circle him taunting him and his dog

DAVID (CONT’D)
It’s not a page count thing
There’s no “idea department at
Macy’s” and this place turns out to
be not so conducive to the creative
process after all Okay Bye

ACROSS THE STREET - David now witnesses There are three
seventeen year old girls on the other side of the street
One of them the prettiest is JANICE HEDDON David notices
she is wearing the same large “B” pendant that Amy wears in
her cheerleading photo

Janice is being encouraged by her girlfriends to do
something In fact on closer inspection it looks like
Janice’s friends goading her - daring her With a slightly
mischievious look Janice crosses the street and walks right
up to Niles As soon as she starts to talk to him Niles
drops his head

We cannot hear what is being said but we along with David
can read all the body language

Janice is being flirtatious with Niles
Niles is shy Doesn’t respond to anything she says

David looks over at Janice’s friends who are observing and
laughing quietly to themselves

Janice gets on her knees and pets Niles’ dog

The dog rolls on his back Janice scratches his tummy The
dogs leg starts kicking

Now Daniel Niles’ brother emerges from the bowling
alley He has just bought some smokes He notices Janice with
Niles He yells out-

DANIEL
JEREMY

Niles looks up at his brother His head immediately drops
into shame Janice is confused

JANICE
What’s wrong Jeremy

Niles doesn’t answer Daniel starts moving down to them

JANICE (CONT’D)
Its okay for us to be friends you
know

Niles doesn’t answer Janice smiles at him and then moves to
her friends They are all giggling

David takes this in She’s up to no good this Janice
ANGLE- Janice and her friends enter the bowling alley As she
does she passes ABBY the waitress who is grabbing a smoke
Abby goes back in
Daniel walks up to Niles
DANIEL

What’re ya doing Jeremy You’re

supposed to stay away from the

girls

He seems to get no response from Niles

DANIEL (CONT’D)
You hear me

When Niles doesn’t respond Daniel SLAPS a stunned Niles
The following is said loud enough that David does hear it

DANIEL (CONT’D)
You gotta stay away from the girls
Jeremy- Ya hear me What if her
daddy saw all this
Niles lowers his head and nods

NILES
But she’s my girlfriend

And this alarms Daniel
DANIEL
No she is not She’s sixteen years
old
Daniel puts his hand on Niles’s shoulder comforting him
DANIEL (CONT’D)
I can’t protect you if you don’t do

your part You understand

Niles nods

DANIEL (CONT’D)
Okay then Let’s go home

NILES
To get lunch

DANIEL
To get lunch

The two of them walk away
LARRY taps David on the back

HARRY
It’s thirty-seven-fifty

David reaches into his pocket and pulls out a credit card
HARRY (CONTD)
Goddamn Arabs huh
(looks at card)

The green stuff only my friend
David nods his head Right He forgot that about this town
ACROSS THE STREET- Charlie and the gang arrive They pile
out of the truck They notice David Laughing they all wave
at him before entering Blackie’s Bowling Alley

David looks in his wallet Pulls out two twenties

HARRY (CONT’D)
You need change

David shakes his head “No”

INT BLACKIE’S BLACKWATER BOWLING ALLEY DAY

As David enters he notices Charlie and the crew congregated
by the bar They are laughing and carrying on David assumes
he’s the butt of their good time

Tom is also there talking sternly to Janice

TOM HEDDON
I mean it Janice

JANICE
(head down)
I understand

TOM HEDDON
There’s trouble brewing with that
man

It is clear that Abby busted Janice for talking to Niles
Janice nods Tom feels she has gotten the message and
reaches into his pocket Tom pulls a few bucks out and hands
it to her

TOM HEDDON (CONT’D)
Make sure you bring me the change
I know how much things cost
JANICE
(kissing him)
Thanks daddy

Janice trots away She smiles to David He nods back

DAVID
Full leaded Coors please

Now the crew turns around

CHRIS
That’s the way Chief

Before David can respond a voice from behind him

COACH
Hey boys

This is COACH STAN MILKENS - heavy set about thirty-five

NOTE - The current coach Stan Milkens will call the former
coach Tom Heddon “Coach” and vice versa throughout

Tom looks over at him- a bit pissed

TOM HEDDON

No practice this afternoon Coach
COACH

A hundred and five out there

coach don’t want any lawsuits
CHARLIE

Aw hell This weather’s
“Blackwater Heaven” What we
thrived in

(turns to Heddon)
It’s what made us champions Ain’t
that right coach

TOM HEDDON
Damn fucking straight it was

Tom says this almost with resentment It’s immediately clear
that the new coach REPLACED Tom Heddon

Norman starts to rack up the pool balls

TOM HEDDON (CONT’D)
Ain’t nobody got a measure of what
it takes to make a man no more

And the grumpy way Tom says that is an indication of why Tom
may have lost his job as coach

CHARLIE
Coach you met Mr Sumner yet

The coach turns to David

COACH
No I haven’t You’re Amy’s
husband aren’t you

DAVID
That’s right David Sumner

COACH
We sure are proud of her You’re a
movie man right

DAVID
Yup That’s me The movie man

David’s drink is delivered to him
COACH

I knew your wife back when she was
head cheerleader I was Assistant

Coach I’ve been meaning to come

town

DAVID

(looking over at crew)
I think I’ve just been welcomed

CHARLIE

NORMAN

David lifts up his beer to them

DAVID
Well I live to tell the tale

CHRIS

The coach goes back on topic

DAVID
(to Coach)
That sounds like something
Congratulations

DAVID
What’s that

COACH
A little something we do every year

We go to church let the rev pump
us full of God and then the boys
scrimmage while the town picnics on
the sidelines Used to do that in
the Civil War - town comin’ out and
actually watching the battles
Picnicing

DAVID
(smiling)
But this I assume they take
seriously

CHRIS
That they do

DAVID
I trust the whole town will be
there

COACH
Every living soul

DAVID
In that case when in Rome

David finishes his drink

DAVID (CONT’D)
Amy and I’1l1 be there

David looks up at a photo he has never seen before It says
“STATE FINALISTS 1997” and there is the whole crew - Bic
Charlie Norm and Chris - and Tom Heddon the coach Also
there is Sheriff Burke

CHARLIE
Long days past

David lays a hundred dollars on the table gives Charlie a
good stare Then to Blackie-

DAVID
Drinks as far as this hundred’1l
take you gentlemen

David then exits And after he does the tension is broken
when The whole group starts to laugh

TOM HEDDON
Well whatchya waitin’ for Let’s
take that hundred for a spin

EXT CHURCH DAY

Several cars are parked in front of the local church We see
them in a TRACKING SHOT One pick-up Chevy or Ford after
another Eventually we get to the Jaguar Amy and David get
out of the car
AMY
You sure you want to do this

DAVID
I promised I’d be here so-

AMY
It’s your Sunday

They head into the church

INT CHURCH DAY

Amy and David sit quietly as the pastor speaks David looks
around at the townfolk there It includes the boys football
team the cheerleading squad (Janice included) Tom Heddon

and isolated from the rest Niles

PASTOR
Dear Lord please protect the
members of our congregation serving
overseas brave souls who have
dedicated their lives to our
security who have made it their
lives’ mission to protect us from
those who challenge you our Lord

CONGREGATION
Amen

PASTOR
And of course please guide to
victory the Blackwater Black
Knights over Alamo this Friday

CONGREGATION
Amen

PASTOR
Boys please stand for us

The boys football team gets to their feet David makes note
of the importance the town seems to be putting into them He

notices in fact that Amy is paying rapt attention

PASTOR (CONT’D)
God stands with you boys Because
you stand with him You listen to
him and like Noah you will
survive when he unleashes his wrath
on the non-believers

(MORE )

PASTOR (CONTD)

Remember that the doubters and
sinners mocked Noah not just for
building his Ark but for what he
preached

David taps Amy on the knee

DAVID
I’m getting some air

He gets up to leaveCharlie and Tom Heddon are among those
aware he is leaving Amy rolls her eyes Her husband doesn’t
realize how much of a snub he has committed She may not like
it here but she doesn’t want to cause trouble

EXT CHURCH DAY

David is sitting in his car sunglasses on resting with his
chair tilted back

Congregants file out of the Church David does not notice
BANG-BANG-BANG On the window

It is CHARLIE VENNER

David is startled

CHARLIE
Hey there Mr Sumner I saw you
leaving Bored with the sermon

DAVID
No No Just not my thing

CHARLIE
What’s that

DAVID
Religion God

CHARLIE
God’s not “your thing”

DAVID
Noah and the flood Smiting first
borns Sodom and Gomorrah
(trying to be funny)
He sounds like a bully to me

CHARLIE
Can I give you a piece of friendly
advice

(MORE )
CHARLIE (CONTD)
(off David’s nod)
It’s one thing to come into town
thinking you’re too good for the
people who live here-

DAVID
I don’t know why you’d say that-

CHARLIE

But being too good for God Well
that’s another thing entirely

(beat)
The Pastor he worked all week long
writing that sermon and then he’s
gotta watch you get up and leave
Some people might call that rude

DAVID
Well thank you Charlie I guess I
need to be more sensitive

CHARLIE
Just some redneck wisdom See ya at
the picnic then

And as Charlie walks away

DAVID
Charlie There is something in the
Bible I believe

Charlie turns around

CHARLIE
What’s that sir

And David says the following quietly and with a small
trying to be less confrontational

DAVID
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s
wife

From behind Charlie Amy is coming to the car

CHARLIE
I believe in that too But what
happens when thy neighbor’s wife
covets you What then

smile

David is taken aback by this statement but before he can
respond at all Amy arrives (not having heard any part of the

conversation)

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Hey Amy-cakes Just tellin’ the
boss we gotta a bunch more tiles
coming in on Tuesday - should
really get us to the end damn quick
after that

AMY
Good

CHARLIE
(walking off)
See you at the picnic

Amy enters the car David starts up the car

INT JAGUAR DAY

There is a stone silence between Amy and David as they drive
in a queue of vehicles heading off to the barbecue Then-

AMY
You know next time if you don’t
want to be somewhere just don’t
accept the invitation

David nods

DAVID
Youre right

After a few more seconds-

DAVID (CONT’D)
How well did you know Charlie back
when you lived here

AMY
What What does it matter

DAVID
It doesn’t I just was curious
Were you guys close

AMY
He was a senior when I was a
freshman- we went out a few times

DAVID
Were you into him back then

Amy is getting annoyed with the line of questioning

AMY
Why’re you grilling me David
What did he say to you back there

DAVID
Nothing worth talking about

AMY
Then why are we talking about it

David doesn’t respond
AMY (CONTD)
Let’s just show our faces at the

barbecue and leave

David nods Fine

EXT BLACKWATER HIGH SCHOOL DAY

Establishing shot There is a big barbecue going on The
same trucks that were at the church are here now

EXT HIGH SCHOOL GROUNDS DAY

On a makeshift stage a singer is belting out his version of
“Copperhead Road” By Steve Earle The song will play over
the entirety of the scene

In the background we see a football scrimmage is process
Tom Heddon yells to the coach and the players - reliving his
good old days

Children race around and play

At one end of the field stands Niles and his puppy

We find David at a grill being handed some hot dogs Behind
David is Daniel Niles’ brother David reaches into his

pocket and takes out some cash smirking

DAVID
No credit cards I assume

The two teens running the grill look at him blankly They
don’t get the joke

TEENAGER 1
No sir just money

David hands over the cash He sees a big bowl of chili

David applies the chili to his hot dog He starts walking
looking for Amy He takes a big bite of the hot dog some of
the chili drips on his chin which he wipes away In the
distance he sees Charlie’s pickup truck arriving

DAVID
(sotto)
Fashionably late

He finally spots Amy at one of the picnic tables far away
He walks towards her

ANGLE - AMY’S PICNIC TABLE

Amy is sitting with two people One of them is Janice and
the other is AMELIE She is roughly Amy’s age and we suspect
she is Janice’s sister She is pregnant

AMELIE
Goddamn we always knew you’d make
it We always did

AMY
I don’t know about that It’s not
like I’ve ever been the lead of a
show you know

AMELIE
As far as we’re all concerned it
didn’t matter you weren’t the lead
of the show- you were the best
thing on it

AMY
We had some really great actors-

JANICE
I don’t know why it’s not on
anymore Everybody I knew watched
it

AMY
(smiling)
I’m sure if NBC went by
Blackwater’s ratings alone wed be
on forever

AMELIE
Are you allowed to spill the beans
on that guy who played Evan What’s
his name-

From behind them David arrives carrying the hot dogs
DAVID
There you are

AMY
Sorry I ran into the girls

The two girls stand up

AMY (CONTD)
David this is Janice

JANICE
Hi

DAVID
Hey how are you

He hands a hot dog to Amy

DAVID (CONT’D)
(to Janice)
I saw you at the bowling alley
right

JANICE
Probably I’m always hanging out
there ‘cause my daddy’s always
hanging out there The coach You
know Tom Heddon

DAVID
Of course A very memorable man

David notices that Janice is wearing her “B” pendant
DAVID (CONT’D)
Amy you have that same pendant
right
JANICE
That’s ‘cause Amy was head
cheerleader just like I am
Amy wants to get off this topic right away-
AMY
And this is Amelie We went to
school together

David looks over at her and he grins

DAVID
So when’s the big day

AMELIE
Pardon me

DAVID
When are you going to have the
baby

AMELIE
(shocked)
You thinkI’m pregnant

DAVID
(fumbling)
WellI justno I

Amelie starts laughing

AMELIE
Just messin’ with you
(beat)
Two months

David laughs as well They all sit down

DAVID
So what’s everyone talking about

AMELIE
We were giving shit to Amy ‘cause
she ain’t been down to see us since
she got here I guess she don’t
wanna be hounded for autographs and
such

AMY
I’ve told them how busy we are
getting the place fixed up and all

DAVID
Amy’s been busting her butt up
there while I’ve been writing I’1l
vouch for that

AMELIE
You make movies right

David has taken a huge bite of his hot dog and his mouth is
full as he chomps away and tries to speak at the same time

DAVID
Hmm-hmm Write ‘em

AMY
David worked on “Battleship” for a
year It’s how we met

Janice when David isn’t looking looks at Amy and mouths

“Hes so cute” Amy smiles back at Janice
AMELIE
Oh yeah This one’s a war movie
too huh
AMY

(interrupting)
There’s also a great love story in
David’s movie That’s what makes it
so layered

VOICE
Hey all

It’s Charlie

AMELIE
Hey handsome

CHARLIE
(charming)
M’ lady
(to Amy)
How was it being back in church
Ames Didn’t get a lot of that in
Los Angeles I’1l bet

AMY
It was nice

CHARLIE
Old times right

Charlie goes over to Amelie gets on his knees

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
May I

Amelie nods Charlie puts his hand on her stomach

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Ain’t movin’ about today huh

AMELIE
Taking a nap I suppose

CHARLIE
(Re music)
How do you like our local music

DAVID
(faux enthusiasm)
Very much

CHARLIE
Yeah We like it But it ain’t
quite your Beethoven

DAVID
You recognized my music
(takes a swig of beer)
I’m impressed

CHARLIE
That’s what a year and a half at
University of Tennessee will do for
you Music Appreciation

AMELIE
Charlie got a full boat
Scholarship

CHARLIE
Which held up as long as my knee
did Which wasn’t too long

Norman comes sauntering over He nudges Charlie away

NORMAN

Hey man go knock up somebody your
damn self - this one’s mine

(turns to David)
See there Mr Sumner you ain’t
the only one with a trophy wife

(grinning)
Only difference is my trophy’s for
third place

AMELIE
Believe it or not that’s the most
romantic thing he’s ever said
(beat)
That and “You’re what”

Everybody laughs at Norman’s expense

-Except Amy - who isn’t taking well to this women-as-
property chat Everybody laughs louder But now look

Niles has quietly arrived at the table

NILES
Hello Amy

AMY
(quietly)
Hello Jeremy How are you

Niles smiles quietly Charlie stands up Niles turns his
direction to Janice

NILES
Hello Janice

Amelie gets nervous - sees the potential for trouble

AMELIE
Jeremy you need to git Okay

Now TOM HEDDON comes barreling into the scene grabs Niles
from behind and throws him right ACROSS THE PICNIC TABLE

JANICE
Jesus daddy

Niles goes down on the ground On his hands and knees

The song in the background continues It adds a kind of
ironic score to the goings on-

TOM HEDDON
You need to get outta here boy

Tom kicks Niles in his ass Niles falls flat on his stomach

AMELIE
Jesus in Heaven Stop it Coach
(feigning panic)
I think I’m gonna have my baby
right now

TOM HEDDON
(in his own world)
Ya stay away from my daughter ya
hear boy

DAVID
You need to stop that

TOM
(not paying attention)
Cmon git up

NILES
(half crying)
I didn’t do anything

Charlie and his posse gather around They are all holding
beers and watching the incident Amused by it all So are
the others who have gathered

Niles gets on his feet Stands in front of Tom head bowed
Chastened humiliated Charlie and his gang are laughing

CHRIS
(clearly buzzed)
Cmon Nilesyou can take him

Niles looks to Tom Heddon pleadingly

NILES
Janice is my girlfriend

Tom’s eyes widen with rage - Then with all his force he SLAPS
Niles in the face

TOM HEDDON
You gonna stay away from Janice -
You gonna stay away from all the
girls-

Now to David’s shock Amy barrels on to the scene

AMY
Stop it

She grabs Tom’s hands But Tom quickly breaks free and holds
Amy by the wrists

TOM HEDDON
Girl you ain’t been here in years
Ain’t got no right to be involved

Finally David moves forward But before he can do anything
Charlie is in the mix He grabs Tom’s shoulder

CHARLIE
Coach- C’mon now

Tom smiles at Amy as he releases her wrists Amy stares him
down as David comes by her side

DAVID
We should go

AMY
You leave him alone Coach
Jeremys just talking that’s all

DAVID
We need to go

CHARLIE
That’s a good idea Mr Sumner
Violence ain’t near as pretty a
thing as it is in the movies

David stares Charlie up and down Then he and Amy walk away
We PULL THEM In the BG we see Daniel walk up on the scene to
come and collect up his brother Niles We can barely make
out what they are saying (meaning that David and Amy can as
well)

DANIEL
Alright Niles It’s over now
(to Heddon)
It’s over

TOM HEDDON
You don’t say I didn’t warn you

Amy and David arrive at their Jaguar

INT JAGUAR DAY
David drives Amy stares out the window

DAVID
I’m not very happy with you

AMY
(equally cold)
No Why
DAVID

Why did you throw yourself into
that With that drunk You could
have gotten hurt

AMY
Somebody had to He was hurting
him

DAVID

“Somebody” had to What does that
mean

Amy doesn’t have to say a damn thing He knows exactly what
she means David screeches the car to a halt

DAVID (CONT’D)
I’m not going to get into the
fucking fray okay I don’t care
if it’s “how things are done” here
It’s it’s against my principles

AMY
Pretty convenient your principles

David stares at her Pissed as can fucking be

And with that David revs up the car and they drive off

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Amy watches television in the bedroom David comes in They
are clearly not talking to one another

David begins his exercise routine - jumping rope He is at
it fast and furious Making a lot of noise

AMY
Do you mind

David stops Chucks the rope to the floor

DAVID
Sorry

David is ready to take a shower He goes to get his robe
As he opens the closet he discovers

FLUTEY THE CAT

DEAD

HANGING

From one of David’s neckties He slams shut the closet door
Horrified He sits on the edge of the bed - speechless

AMY
What is it

DAVID
Nothing

Amy gets up from the bed to see for herself

AMY
Nothing

DAVID
Don’t

But it is too late Amy opens up the closet door And she
SCREAMS

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

David comes into the room having locked up downstairs
DAVID

We’re keeping the doors locked from
now on Okay

AMY
Great

David starts to take his clothes off

AMY (CONT’D)
It was Charlie or Norman

David does not respond

AMY (CONTD)
Did you hear me

DAVID
What

AMY
Venner or Scutt Or any of those
assholes

David is very confused here

DAVID
Why Why would they do that

AMY
To prove they could get into your
bedroom

DAVID

I don’t believe that

AMY
Who else is around all the time

DAVID
Amy you’re jumping to- Look the
truth is that we leave our doors
open all the time Any vagrant
could have-

AMY
(yelling now)
David a complete stranger wanders
into our house strangles our cat
and hangs her in the closet a
VAGRANT A FUCKING VAGRANT

They stare it off for a while

AMY (CONTD)

It was Charlie or Norman or Bic or
Chris Or all of them They came
between church and the picnic

She walks back to the closet and pulls some clothes to the
side A safe is there - a safe that David knew nothing
about She opens it up Pulls out a gun

AMY (CONTD)

This was my father’s From now on
it stays with us They’ll go
further next time

DAVID
Aren’t you being extreme

AMY
THEY KILLED OUR CAT DAVID
WHAT’S YOUR DEFINITION OF EXTREME

This is the first time Amy has really let David have it
Really made him feel small He walks out

AMY (CONTD)
That’s right Do that Walk away
EXT SUMNER BACKYARD NIGHT
David digs a hole in the ground It is next to two graves

that of Marcus and Helen Wilcox - Amy’s parents When he is
done he takes Flutey and lays him in the hole

INT DAVID’S STUDY MORNING

David stares out the window at Charlie and the crew Amy
walks in with a tray that has coffee and milk

AMY
Are you just going to stare

DAVID
I’m not going to go out there and
just blatantly accuse them What if
they didn’t do it It’s going to
be hard living here having accused
them of something like that

AMY
Then just mention to them what
happened and see how they react

David does not respond

AMY (CONTD)
It’s at least possible isn’t it
That they did it

DAVID
Okay Okay I’11 go out and mention
to them that the cat is missing
See if they’ve seen him

Amy’s body language betrays her disappointment in David

DAVID (CONT’D)
You don’t think that’s enough do
you

AMY
Not quite No

She leaves David sits alone Crushed that she thinks he is
a coward

INT KITCHEN DAY

Amy looks out the window David has climbed to the roof and
is talking to the men She and we can barely make David out

DAVID
Can you guys give me a hand I
wanna put the bear trap up
(MORE )

DAVID(CONTD)

I’m a bit lost on how to do that
sort of thing

We stay with Amy as she watches David and the men climb down
Stay on her stay
The door opens and David enters He seems excited

DAVID (CONT’D)
I’m laying a trap for them

AMY
When

DAVID
Right now
INT LIVING ROOM DAY

Charlie and Norman are sitting by the bear trap which is
laying down by the fireplace

CHARLIE
Do you want it open or closed Mr
Sumner

DAVID

Uh I don’t- open I guess

Norman and Charlie try to open up the teeth of the bear trap
on either end But Norman slips and the teeth SLAM SHUT
Charlie jumps backwards

NORMAN
Sorry Charlie

The two men start to work again

CHRIS
Watch that hand on the spring
(to David)
Pretty dangerous

Norman slides on the safety lock Done

NORMAN
Where’d you like it sir

DAVID
Right there I guess Over the
fireplace

Now Amy enters the room

AMY
You boys want some beer

Amy is carrying a tray with five beers and a SAUCER OF MILK

CHRIS
That’d be great Ames

Norman takes his NAIL GUN and slams two nails over the
fireplace

BIC
Thank you Can never say “no”

David notices the MILK Stares down Amy It’s childish
bullshit If the workers are taken aback they are not
showing it

Norman puts the nail gun down and lifts his beer to Amy

NORMAN
Just right Thank you

CHARLIE
Now Mr Sumner-

DAVID
“David” Really - you guys can
call me David

CHARLIE
Great David Tomorrow’s gonna be
a helluva day for huntin’ Why
don’t you come with us

DAVID
(shakes his head)
Oh I’ve uh - I never hunted much

In fact he’s never hunted a day in his life

NORMAN
But you have shot

DAVID
Just once or twice but that was-

NORMAN
It doesn’t make sense to live here
and not take a shot or two

DAVID
Right - I understand

CHARLIE
There’s tradition and then there’s
a lifestyle
(friendly smile)
That whole “when-in-Rome” thing

David exchanges looks with a seething Amy Then to the men

DAVID
Tomorrow you say

AMY
(interrupting)
What about your work The roof

DAVID
They can wait

Amy nods and leaves the room
CHARLIE
Well pick you up tomorrow morning

then Say 730

DAVID
Sounds great 730

The men put down their beers

CHARLIE
Better get back to it

DAVID
Oh uh I don’t have a gun

With a big grin he takes down one of the confederate rifles

DAVID (CONT’D)
Maybe this will do

The men laugh Norman says quietly

NORMAN
Well have plenty extra sir

As they leave the room David gives a stare down at the bowl
of milk Pissed

EXT BLACKWATER ROADS DAY

Amy is running Intercut this over the next TWO scenes

INT TRUCK NEXT MORNING

David is squeezed in the middle of the gang Note that
Charlie is not there We see him following in an old Mustang
(David has taken Charlie’s normal seat)

BIC
So how’d you meet Ames

DAVID
What

BIC
Howd you meet your wife

DAVID
Oh At a wrap party For that show
“Battleship” we both worked on

BIC
That show was the shit man

DAVID
Thank you

CHRIS
Love at first sight

DAVID
Nope At first sight Amy gave me
hell for not giving her more lines
Can’t say I blame her

NORMAN
Looks like she forgave you

BIC
We was always wonderin’ who’d she’d
end up with

DAVID
That’s what I keep hearing

CHRIS
Gotta sell your soul to the devil
to get a girl like Amy Wilcox
(MORE )

CHRIS (CONTD)

That’1l be some kinda day when he
comes around to collect

Chris has a good laugh from this

POLICE SCANNER
John Gotta send a unit down to

McMan’s
JOHN BURKE’S VOICE
Got it
BIC
(laughing)

Looks like Ben’s been kickin’ the
dog and Lily ‘gain

Norm reaches behind one of the seats He takes out a bright
orange vest He hands it to David

NORMAN
More important than a life vest
Whole buncha assholes out there
shooting anything that moves

DAVID
Thank you

Bic looks down at the rifle in David’s lap

BIC
You know what you got there

David shakes his head “No”

BIC (CONTD)
That is a bolt action thirty aught
six Remington You got yourself a
three hundred yard range there with
a nice flat trajectory

CHRIS
It’s a thing of beauty

DAVID
Great
EXT WOODS DAY
David Charlie and the crew enter through the treeline

CHARLIE
Lemme ask you a question Can I

DAVID
Sure

CHARLIE
Why’re you making a movie about a
buncha Russians

DAVID
I prefer to think about it as a
universal tale about survival and
perseverance and the human spirit
Ninety percent of Stalingrad was
occupied by the Nazis and still
they managed to beat them - and
they did it with innovation and
internal fortitude they didn’t even
know they had

CHRIS
Sounds like the time we were twenty-
two down against Montclair

CHARLIE
(ignoring Chris)
And you don’t think God had
anything to do with helping the
Russkies

David laughs

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
What’s so funny

DAVID
That God would help a nation of
atheists

CHARLIE

Maybe God looked at who they were
fighting and he picked his side

DAVID
Do you think God was picking sides
in the holocaust

CHARLIE
He works in mysterious ways

DAVID
The most dangerous line ever
uttered

Charlie smiles at that one David decides to spring it

DAVID (CONT’D)
Somebody broke in to the house by
the way Killed our cat

Charlie stops in his tracks

CHARLIE
Flutey

DAVID
Yeah Amy’s a mess

CHRIS
What makes you think Flutey was
killed - didn’t just pass away

DAVID
Cats don’t hang themselves

CHRIS
Maybe he was depressed

Charlie gives Chris a “knock it off” look

CHARLIE
Somebody hanged Flutey

DAVID
In our closet

CHARLIE
I’m gonna tell you something
David This world can be pretty
fucked up Hanged God damn

As they continue to quietly move through the woods into a
thickening mist Charlie quietly signals to Norman that he is
breaking away Norman nods Charlie leaves David is too far
ahead to notice

INT SUMNER HOUSE DAY

Amy goes through the same ritual we saw from her earlier as
she takes a bath

EXT WOODS DAY

Close on David as he walks deeper into the woods A mist
grows thicker David can hear Bic behind him talking

BIC
It ain’t nothin’ for nothin’ you
see My brother tells me he’s
become a vegetarian

David does not pay attention to any of it

BIC (CONTD)

Hooks up with the redhead with the
tiny tits and becomes a health
freak

CHRIS
Man you got yourself what you call
a inferiority complex

Now their voices become more and more quiet

BIC
What does that mean

CHRIS
You want Eric’s girl- so you uh
you cut her down at the knees

And now we can’t hear them at all

David trudges ahead it takes him a few seconds to realize
that he is all alone In the woodsIn the mist
DAVID
Guys

No answer He hears a few loud SNAPS

DAVID (CONT’D)
Guys

No Answer David clutches his rifle Then
BAM

A BULLET BLASTS right past David’s ear He drops to the
ground in a panic What the fuck just happened

Now a MAGNIFICENT BUCK leaps over David
Then it stops Spins
And then disappears again into the woods Into the mist

David remains on the ground Still floored

Now here come Bic Chris and Norman

NORMAN
Shit Shit Shit

David clutches his rifle Tight

NORMAN (CONT’D)
You okay

David can’t say anything he’s fucking terrified Did they
try and shoot him or the deer

BIC
You see the buck

David can barely spit the words out

DAVID
You you shot at me

BIC
Don’t talk like that man Did you
see the buck

DAVID
It was just hereit was

NORMAN
Okay Bic go South I’ll go
North Mr Sumner you go East
which is that way Chris you go

West
Norman grabs David by the shoulders

NORMAN (CONT’D)
You okay
(friendly laugh)
Ain’t peein’ your pants are you
DAVID
I’m fine
(beat)
I’m going East

David pulls away from Norman and starts to walk East

INT SUMNER HOUSE FOYER DAY

Amy answers a knock at the door It’s Charlie Before Amy
can object Charlie insinuates himself into the door jam

CHARLIE
Amy-cakes

Amy doesn’t say anything She moves to close the door But
Charlie’s in the way

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
What

AMY
Somebody killed Flutey

CHARLIE
I heard about that baby I’m
sorry But I didn’t do it

AMY
(not listening)
Why why would you do that

CHARLIE
I wouldn’t and I didn’t
(beat)
I want to come in

AMY
You can’t

Charlie moves into the house nonetheless Note that the door
has been left open

AMY (CONTD)
David’s going to be home soon

CHARLIE
David’s busy becoming a man out in
the woods Gettin’ his first
blood

Charlie moves to the couch He taps it

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Remember

AMY
(scared now)
Look Charlie just leave okay
Forget about the cat-

Charlie moves toward her angry now

CHARLIE
I didn’t hurt Flutey

AMY
Okay I’m sorry You’re scaring-

CHARLIE
Youre sorry

AMY
Yeah I just---

Charlie pushes her up against the wall She’s trapped He
moves into kiss her She pulls her head away

CHARLIE
Don’t give me this shit You can
fool Davey boy --- but you got more

history with me than him

AMY
I’m with him now We’re married

CHARLIE
I hear that doesn’t mean shit out
there in Hollywood

AMY
It means something to me- please
leave

CHARLIE

I will Soon

Amy tries to push her way past Charlie but he violently
slams her up against the wall He puts the palm of his hand
over her mouth

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Best if you just let it happen

Charlie releases his hand He pushes her backwards and she
flips over the couch Charlie leaps over the couch landing
on top of Amy He’s so heavy on her that she can’t possibly
move He leans in to kiss her She avoids him

Charlie moves his hands down to her pants and pulls them
down Amy shakes her head “No” A tear developing But
Charlie continues

As he lowers his pants he moves in to kiss her Again she
averts her head Now matter of factly he enters her

EXT WOODS DAY

David continues to walk And then he sees it THE BUCK
Looking regal Beautiful David slowly lifts his rifle and
aims it at the unsuspecting animal But look at David’s eyes
He can’t bring himself to do it

INT LIVING ROOM DAY

Charlie is slamming into Amy Every time that she moves her
head away he draws her face back

CHARLIE
Did you miss me baby Have you
missed me

Amy nods She’s crying - not hysterically though - it’s
tears of abject sadness Or humiliation

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Tell me you missed me

And this is not a request

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Tell me Amy

And what she says now is bathed in both truth and
overwhelming fear

AMY
I missed you Charlie

CHARLIE
How many times when he was inside
of you did you imagine it was me
there Me making that love

Amy doesn’t answer Instead she uneasily pulls Charlie’s
face in and kisses him

EXT WOODS DAY

David and the buck continue their stand-off Eventually he
lowers his rifle Ready to fire The Buck takes off David
is relieved But then

The Buck stops Frozen in place

David’s instinct takes over He lifts his rifle and BLAST

The buck goes down Clearly dead One perfect shot A shot
that David had no idea was in him

INT LIVING ROOM DAY

Charlie and Amy continue to have sex He climaxes She
smiles gently but not genuinely - overwhelmed by a bizarre
series of emotions Does she feel guilty for betraying David
now Or for betraying her heritage for all these years Or
did she betray him Or - it’s just so fucking confusing to
her

Now look at Charlie He unemotionally pulls his pants up
Amy runs her hands along his chin Now Charlie averts her

And with that Norman materializes He’s holding his rifle
Moves in closer

Amy is stunned Terrified Charlie seems equally surprised

Norman nods to Charlie It’s his turn Charlie shakes his
head but Norman nods once more

AMY

(crying)
No

Charlie looks down at Amy Then back to the determined
Norman He makes a decision chooses a path

Charlie flips Amy over Looks at Norman and nods
AMY (CONTD)
(crying)

Don’t

Charlie holds Amy down Nods to Norman “Let’s go” And as
Amy cries Norman climbs on top of her

Norman starts raping her sodomizing her She lies defeated
resigned Charlie looks on In fact the CAMERA REMAINS on
Charlie throughout

EXT WOODS DAY

David walks up to the slain buck Kneels Runs his hands
along the fur

INT LIVING ROOM DAY

Norman runs his hands down Amy’s back

EXT HIGHWAY DAY
David walks along the side of the road Clearly pissed He

a car passes him David puts out his thumb and is ignored

INT LIVING ROOM DAY
Norman is done He gets up

Charlie kneels down by Amy Runs his hands through her hair
Amy is too numb to respond He kisses her on the forehead

CHARLIE

Charlie gets up and signals Norman to follow him

David looks over the rifle

TRUCK DRIVER (CONT’D)
Right there

David sees where he is pointing and puts the safety on

TRUCK DRIVER (CONT’D)

David smiles at him but looks out the window He doesn’t
want to yap After a few seconds

TRUCK DRIVER (CONT’D)
Where do you wanna be dropped off

DAVID
Blackwater

As David looks out the window Charlie’s pick-up SPEEDS
past The buck lays in the bed of the truck The antlers are
tied to the front David seems to make eye contact - it’s
kind of eerie really - with the slain beast

INT SUMNER HOUSE DAY
David enters the house

DAVID
Amy

He continues to walk He opens the bathroom door Amy sits
in the bathtub clutching her knees David notices a glass
of wine on the sink Amy is startled

AMY

friends

AMY
They’re assholes

DAVID
I’m firing them

AMY
(sarcastic)
Hooray for you tiger

DAVID
(he’s had enough)
What the fuck does that mean

AMY
If you would have said something
ages ago about the cat this would
never have happened

DAVID
I was getting them to talk until
you pulled that childish stunt with
the milk

AMY
You

DAVID
(firm)
I’m not done You pushed me and
you never do any good by pushing
When are you ever going to learn
about growing up

AMY
I’m trying to Believe me

DAVID
Well you’re a little late

And now David starts to leave

AMY
You’re a coward

DAVID
No I’m not

AMY
And I’m a coward Plain and
simple

David is still stuck on Amy’s accusation Repeats himself

DAVID
No I’m not

AMY
I don’t blame you for hiding in
your study
(starts crying)
But I can’t live in there with you
anymore

Amy is so emotional that David comes by and sits next to her
on the rim of the tub

DAVID
Okayeasy baby

David gently kisses her - As he does we get a
FLASHBACK OF THE RAPE

And we snap back to Amy

AMY
David let’s leave

DAVID
No

AMY

Let’s go Let’s be happy We’1l
go back to Los Angeles Please

David stands up

DAVID
No Not a chance

AMY
(pleading)
David I want to go back to work
We could have a baby

DAVID
We’re not being chased out of our
home We won’t be bullied
(points at her)
Tomorrow I’m firing them and that
will show them

AMY
There’s a difference between
standing up to somebody and using
power over them

David soaks this in for a bit Then -

DAVID
I need to write

EXT SUMNER HOUSE DAY

The next morning as the men unload from the truck David
walks up to Charlie

DAVID
Charlie can I borrow you for a
minute

CHARLIE

INT STUDY DAY
David and Charlie enter

CHARLIE
What’s up Mr Sumner

DAVID
I don’t think the roof is coming
together fast enough

CHARLIE
Really How fast do you think it
should be coming together

DAVID
Its been two weeks more than that-

CHARLIE
How long’s it usually take you to
roof David

DAVID
That’s not the point You guys
work for a few hours laze about-

CHARLIE
“Laze about”

DAVID
I’m sorry maybe a bad choice of
words I’m just not happy I think

CHARLIE
Weve already ordered supplies We
can’t reneg on that

DAVID
That’s okay I’1ll cover that cost

DAVID
Cash What makes you think I’d
have that much money on me

CHARLIE
(laughing)
I’m just fuckin’ with you
DAVID
Oh
CHARLIE

But if you could make it out to
“cash” that’d be appreciated

David opens the checkbook and starts to write Charlie looks
around the room Examines David’s outline Seems interested

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Got your lead character dying at
the end of your movie huh

DAVID
That’s the way it is right now

CHARLIE
Interesting

Charlie is still looking over the outline

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Most people don’t realize that
without the Russians Hitler
probably woulda won the whole
shebang

DAVID
That’s right University of
Tennessee

CHARLIE
Nah History Channel
(grinning)
The working man’s Harvard

As David completes writing the check Amy appears in the
doorway Charlie notices her

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Hello Amy

AMY
Charlie

And the cold and hard way that she says this indicates that
Amy is very much in sync with Charlie being fired

DAVID
Here you go
(beat)
No hard feelings

CHARLIE
Hard feelings are for the weak
wouldn’t ya say

DAVID
(nodding )
I would

CHARLIE
(to Amy)

AMY

Charlie nods and walks past the two of them

DAVID

Charlie turns around David points to the rifle he used in
the hunt

DAVID (CONT’D)
That’s yours

CHARLIE
You can hold onto that In case
you get the itch to go huntin’
again

David shakes his head no Charlie smiles and snatches up the
weapon and leaves

Amy and David don’t speak Instead they watch Charlie
through the window as he tells his crew that they’ve been
fired Charlie shows them the check They all start laughing
as they climb into their truck

EXT SUMNER FARM TWILIGHT

David sits outside with a notebook in his lap going over his
screenplay He seems to be intently editing The unfinished
barn looms large behind him After a few seconds Amy comes
walking up behind him He looks over at her There’s still
obviously some tension between them but there’s a bit of
apology in his voice as he speaks

DAVID

follows behind her and eventually catches up with her and
tries taking her hand She pulls away from him He tries

taking her hand again This time she accepts it and they
continue walking in They don’t say anything to one another

Niles smiles weakly back

JANICE (CONT’D)
Can I ask you something

Niles nods
JANICE (CONT’D)

CHARLIE
Kick-off’s five minutes away

EXT BLACKWATER STADIUM - BLEACHERS NIGHT

looks out on the field as the defensive players rush up
against one another slamming one another As soon as she
sees one of those harsh body slams she has a

FLASHBACK TO THE RAPE TO HER AND NORMAN

Now we will intercut between the players on the field and the
other flashbacks to the rape David looks over at Amy
notices her seemingly uncontrollable winces

ANGLE - LOWER BLEACHERS

EXT FOOTBALL BLEACHERS -

KICKOFF

The ball is knocked into the air by one of the Blackwater
Knights Their opponent takes the ball in mid air and rushes
down the field There’s a gigantic collision that once again
prompts from Amy a vision of

THE RAPE

madman He notices that Janice is not among them Tom turns

to the crew

something

One of the younger cheerleaders HELEN overhears this-

HELEN
I saw her talkin’ to Jeremy Niles

As Melissa gives Helen a nasty look-
94

TOM HEDDON
You sure about that

HELEN
They went off somewhere but I
don’t know where

And Tom becomes overwhelmed with rage and fury

clumsily passing over people that are packed into the
bleachers They have to crawl over Charlie and the crew
which is obviously extremely uncomfortable for Amy who once
again has no eye contact with them

NORMAN

David ignores Amy and her hysteria and walks over to Niles
He kneels in front of him

DAVID

And now the tension starts to get to Amy She’s scared and
that fear soon turns to a kind of anger an anger that
she’s in a terrible situation not of her creation

to ram the house

David starts to run downstairs Follow him The door and
the bricks have loosened and now

SMASH

The truck comes through the wall stone blocks descend upon
it

David goes and grabs a fire iron

The only person who can get out of the car as of now is Tom
Heddon from the passenger side his face still burnt red The
bookcase makes it impossible to get out of the driver’s side
Tom gets out of the truck with his rifle
David takes the fire iron and slams it down on the rifle-
BLAM The gun goes off and literally blows Tom’s foot off
Tom screams in agonizing pain
Bic starts to get out David picks up Tom’s rifle
DAVID (CONT’D)
(voice trembling)
You stay in the truck You don’t
come in here

Bic continues to come at him

I’m warning you

Bic stalls - but at that moment Tom yells out a primal SCREAM
-- David looks over at him Tom has a pistol in his hand -
ready to fire -

BAM

David fires at Tom - killing him instantly - He points the
rifle at Bic who continues forward

BIC
You shouldn’t have done that -

David pulls the trigger But this timenothing
Bic is prompted smiles comes charging

David throws the rifle down and picks up the same FIRE IRON
and slams it right into Bic’s face

Bic collapses
Dead

Something overpowers David - some primal instinct - and he
takes a few more WHACKS at him

Then from behind him he hears a CLICK Turns around Charlie
is facing him and pointing TOM’S GUN at him
Now the ZYDECO MUSIC stops All we hear is the thump-thump-
thump of the needle hitting the inner ring of the record

DAVID
The uh gun’s empty

CHARLIE
Is it

DAVID
Pull the trigger

CHARLIE
Got plenty of time for that

There is a brief stare-off then from upstairs
SCREAMS from Amy

Both Charlie and David race upstairs They both burst into-

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Where Amy is on the bed being attacked by Norman - who HAS
AMYS GUN IN HIS HAND It is clear he is in the throes of
trying to rape her Amy fights back ferociously
David grabs Norman by the ankles pulls him off the bed
Norman lands face first with a THUD on the floor

But Norman gains control is on his feet

Charlie points the rifle at Norman

Norman points Amy’s pistol at Charlie

All the people in the room breathe hard exhausted

David looks to his side and sees

Niles is in the same corner He has been knocked out cold

NORMAN
She belongs to both of us now

When David hears this it hits him like a punch to the gut -it
has meaning Deep meaning - one too horrifying to even
consider David looks over at Amy who can not maintain eye
contact with him

CHARLIE
That’s not why we’re here Norm
Were here for Niles
NOTE We are now in Close-up on Charlie and Norman

Charlie knowing that his rifle doesn’t have any bullets- lays
his gun down

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
I’m puttin’ my weapon down Norm
We shouldn’t have guns on each
other
Norm looks tense-on the edge

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
C’mon Norm

Then
BAM
A BULLET RIPS

Into Norman’s gut- an explosion of blood and guts that
lathers the entire room

AMY has grabbed Charlie’s rifle and pulled the trigger

The rifle was loaded after all It was simply jammed

Norman’s fluttering eyes reveal he is still alive Now Amy
pulls the trigger again - a woman possessed with a righteous
fury- and BAM- Norman is deader than dead- But Amy continues
moving forward-

Now Charlie leaps on her forcibly and quickly removing the
weapon Amy is flung to the ground and instantaneously

Something overcomes David

David in a rage evidenced by a HOWL of anger tackles Charlie
They grapple on the ground

But it is not long before Charlie being larger and stronger
has the upper hand

Amy jumps into the fracas but is thrown off by both men

Amy sees her father’s pistol on the ground
But so does Charlie who races for it Grabs it He takes
the butt of the gun and WHACK - he slams it against David’s
face - a burst of blood The another whack and another Now
David manages to his forearm to deflect another hit from the
gun

Now the fight goes into the hallway both men slamming up
against the walls Well actually more Charlie slamming
David up against the walls

Eventually both men take a tumble down the stairs head over
heels

When they get to their feet they continue to fight but
clearly David is exhausted and there seems to be no way he
can keep up with the stronger and more fit Charlie

OVERHEAD —-

We see that the two men are standing next to the huge PUDDLE
OF BLOOD surrounding the dead Tom David throws a swing at
Charlie who deflects him so deftly that David slips on the
blood and collapses to the groundright next to the bear
trap

Charlie gets on one knee next to David He points the gun to
David’s forehead

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
You couldn’t just give him up

DAVID
(quietly)
No

And at that instant David grabs the bear trap flings it over
himself and right onto Charlie’s head

SNAAAAAPPPPPP

Charlie’s head is trapped

Amy screams in horror

David backs up stunned by what has just happened

Charlie is still alive His neck caught helplessly in the
steel fangs of the trap

AMY
(quietly crying)
Charlie
And then Charlie looking over at Amy his eyes seem to be
pleading

In the background we hear SIRENS approaching

David finds the gun that Charlie has dropped He picks it up
He’s not going to let Charlie expire on his own

BAM

Charlie is dead David looks over at Amy who is as stunned as
he is

David wanders the house

He passes the dead Tom Heddon The dead Bic Amy follows
David as he enters the

INT STUDY SAME TIME

David sees that Chris is dead his throat slit a puddle of
blood beneath him Then - to Amy - or maybe himself

DAVID
I’1l be damned

From behind him

AMY
Aren’t we all

David turns to Amy and says to her - or maybe to himself -
it’s not really clear- given the joyful disbelief in his
voice
DAVID

I got them all
EXT SUMNER HOUSE NIGHT
David sits quietly waiting for the emergency vehicles to
arrive watches the barn burn

INT SUMNER HOUSE NIGHT

Amy is still inside She looks at David’s bulletin board
looking over the outline to his movie

She is holding the revolver Looks at it Can’t believe what
she has been through

Amy sits down in her Daddy’s chair Exhausted - a human being
altered - a bit destroyed

We end on a CLOSE-UP of Amy

The sound of the sirens are getting louder

EXT SUMNER HOUSE NIGHT
David’s face is brightly illuminated by the burning barn

From behind him Niles appears - a ghastly vision given the
reflection of the orange flames

David doesn’t notice him Not at first Not until

NILES’ DOG trots past David David is only slightly
alarmed

NILES
Can I go home now

DAVID
No Jeremy you can’t

Niles sits down on the ground Indian-style He smiles up at
David who smiles back to him And then David turns away

As the sound of the sirens get CLOSER AND CLOSER his eyes
seem to be welling with tears

And we end on a CLOSE-UP of David A small smile

EXT HELICOPTER SHOT NIGHT

As the barn continues to burn emergency vehicles head toward
the Sumner farm

STRAW DOGS
