HENCH (Cont d )
A sensational Poll this morning purports
to give the answers I have with me
Mr Michael Rimmer of Fairburn Polls
and Peter Niss of the rival International
Opinion Polls
I have the feeling Mr Rimmer

RIMMER
Congratulations

The studio audience laugh

HENCH
I get the impression that you conducted
this survey because you felt that this
kind of scientifically disguised smut
would get your firm waximum publicity

RIMMER
Could you tell me why youve invited me
on the programme

HENCH
To find out your real motives for
publishing the poll

RIMMER
And to talk about sex

NISS
Do lets try not to be frivolous

RIMMER
Sex may be frivolous to you Mr Niss
but its not for me or for that matter
the vast majority of people in this
country

NISS
But do we really want to know how many
times a week and how satisfactory the
results

CONTD

RIMMER
Yes Ido I think everybodys interested

NISS
Well its not the sort of Poll that we
could conduct at 10P

RIMMER
I think thats a pity because the more
we know about what people really feel and
want the better This is the only way
were going to be able to adapt our society
to fit its real needs I think Polls are
only beginning

HENCH
Now lets see how our audience feels

HENCH takes hand mike and goes into audience He approaches
a man who obviously doesnt want to talk hiding his face
behind his hands

HENCH
You sir what do you think about
publicising peoples personal sexual
habits

The man still hidden shakes his head and tries to wave
HENCH away

always a great warmth between us One
hates to make party points but

Alexander Mandeville will be Minister
of Labour

Now happily recovered from his illness
I have selected him because above all
Alexander is a deeply human man

CONTD
MANDEVILLE smiles a little nervously

RIMMER (Cont d)
And no one knows more than I how very
human he can be

Caption Minister of Labour’ over the slightly embarrassed
picture of MANDEVILLE

RIMMER
As Public Opinion Polls have become
so vital a part of our democratic way
of life the time has come to take them
out of private hands where they could
possibly be misused I have therefore
created a National Poll board under the
Chairmanship of Peter Niss

NISS smiles modestly

I have chosen him not because he is a
personal friend of myself and my wife
but because he brings that added
dimension of knowing how best to keep
open the lines of communication between
you the people and us your servants

NISS smiles

Now you know that I have never sought
power and now that I have power I
want to share it with you for it is
you the people of Britain who have
made this country great as Winston
Churchill said You are the lion I
merely provide the roar’ and from now
on I want to consult you directly On
every major issue there will be a
referendum in which you may vote so
at last we will have a real democracy

As your Prime Minister I hope Ive

is booming but I must admit that our

seems to have run into difficulties
perhaps I was too idealistic and in

more streamlined form of Presidential
Government You must let me know
if you share this feeling Next

tell me in what could be if it is
your wish the last referendum for
