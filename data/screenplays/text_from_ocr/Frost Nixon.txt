What made you exceptional they said -
was that you had achieved great fame
without possessing any discernible

quality

How kind

CAROLINE
And that you fly around a great deal

FROST
It’s true

CAROLINE
Why

FROST
I like to keep busy

BIRT sees NIXON’s desk scattered with books philosophy
economics memoirs Yellow-pads with notes Memos
Elaborately hand-written

NIXON
Now the first rule of political life
is you never let a President get
behind the wheel of a car Ever Were
not used to doing anything for
ourselves - let alone drive And the
Chairman the way he put his foot
down my guess is the last thing he
drove was a tractor on a Ukrainian
potato farm

CAROLINE looks out of the window - sees a woman in the
gardens talking to groundsmen NIXON’s wife PAT NIXON

NIXON
Anyway he drove us out through the
estate Finally we got out to a remote
point on the coast out there
overlooking the sea And he turned off
the engine And we talked For two
hours straight Most politicians have
tragedy in their early lives I lost
two brothers to tuberculosis He
watched his father die from the cancer
he caught in the steelworks He was a
sad man But a noble adversary

NIXON turns to face FROST BIRT and CAROLINE The tour has
come full circle

FROST
Of course I do beg your pardon

He gets out his cheque-book starts writing

NIXON notices something in FROST’s demeanor

Bob has been Washington correspondent
for Public Radio for the past ten
years Is moving to ABC in the New

ZELNICK
The general view is that Id been
wasting my matinee-idol looks on
radio

JIM RESTON whippet-thin beady-eyed A complex feisty
persona

clears his throat An awkward moment

RESTON
Actually before I sign on I would
like to hear what you were hoping to
achieve with this interview

FROST stops An incredulous smile

FROST
What I want to achieve

FROST exchanges looks with JOHN BIRT

FROST
Jim I’ve secured 12 taping days
close to thirty hours with the most
compelling and controversial
politician of our times Isn‘t that
enough

RESTON
Not for me Id be giving up a year of
my life - leaving my family - to work
on a subject matter that means more
than you can probably imagine And the
idea of doing all that without
achieving what I want to personally -
would be unthinkable to me

FROST
What is it that you want to achieve

RESTON
Id like to give Richard Nixon the
trial he never had

FROST
Wellof course we will be asking
difficult questions
FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407 39

RESTON
Difficult questions” The man lost
fifteen thousand Americans and a
million Indo-Chinese during his
administration He only escaped jail
because of Fords pardon

FROST
Yes but equally going after him in
some knee-jerk way assuming he’s a
terrible guywouldn’t that only
create more sympathy than anything
else

RESTON
Right now I submit it’s impossible to
feel anything close to sympathy for
Richard Nixon He devalued the
Presidency and left the country that
elected him in trauma The American
people need a conviction Pure and
simple The integrity of our political
system of democracy as an idea
entirely depends on it And if in
years to come people look back and say
it was in this interview that Richard
Nixon exonerated himself that would
be the worst crime of all Did you
know that Mike Wallace is doing a
piece on this and that in the bars
around Capitol Hill and Georgetown
this entire project is a joke

A stunned silence Then

Well thank you for that Jim Would
you give us a couple of minutes

little insulted by that

FROST
Whatso all the other domestic
charges against himthe Brookings
Institute the Plumbers Unit the
Enemies Listyou’re saying that all
goes into ‘Watergate’

BRENNAN
Correct

FROST
That’s absurd And a clear breach of
the terms of our agreement

BRENNAN
Okay how would you define Watergate

FROST
That it covers just that The
Watergate break-in of June 17th and
the subsequent cover-up and
investigations

BRENNAN
Fine in which case the deal is off

FROST
Fine - in which case you can expect a
lawsuit for something in excess of 20
million in damages and lost earnings

BRENNAN
The terms of the contract stipulate
quite clearly that Watergate take up
no more than 25 of the time

FROST
Yes - but nowhere does it say that for
the rest of the 75 he gets to drone
on and sound Presidential

BRENNAN almost chokes
FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407 50A

BRENNAN
“Drone on” Jesus Christ Where’s your
respect Remember who youre talking
about You media people you’re so
goddammed smug and self-righteous You
know as well as I do that sixty per
cent of what Nixon did in office was
right and thirty per cent might have
ended up wrong but he thought it was
right at the time

FROST
That still leaves ten percent where he
was doing the wrong thing and knew
it

BRENNAN
I guarantee you if you screw us on
the sixty per cent I’m going to ruin
you if it takes the rest of my life

ContractuallyI thinkwe made a
provision that during each question I
might dab my upper lip Which you
won’t show when you cut it together

You’re probably aware of my history
with perspiration

If youre referring to the TV debate
with Jack Kennedy in 1960

cost me the Presidency People who
listened on the radio thought I’d won

covering a lot of subjects in a great

FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407 61

NIXON
Mr Frost I’m surprised by your
question since we have an agreement
a contractual agreement I believe
that we would cover Watergate in our
last taping session But if your
“viewers” really do have a “major
concern” then perhaps I should
briefly respond to it now

NIXON crosses his legs Sits back

NIXON
What probably very few people realize
is that the taping system in the White
House was set up by my predecessor
President Johnson - partly to avoid
the necessity of having a secretary in
every meeting and partly to ensure
there was a record kept of every
verbal agreement - no matter how off-
the-cuff or casual Initially on
coming into the White House I
insisted on dismantling the system

89 INT BRENNAN’S OFFICE - SAN CLEMENTE - DAY - 89
JACK BRENNAN smiles in satisfaction

BRENNAN
In boxing theres always that moment
you see it in challengers’ faces The
instant they feel the power of the
champ’s first jab A sickening moment
when they realize all the pep-talks
and the hype and the months of
psyching themselves up has been
delusional all along You could see it
in Frost’s face If he hadnt known
the calibre of the man he was up
against before the interviews started
he knew it half way through that first
answer

how crazy it would be to remove the
system which he felt was the best way
to preserve for history important
White House transactions

INT FROST TEAM OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY - ZELNICK

‘s heart sinks watching the monitors

ZELNICK
So much for our “ballsy” opening

NIXON (ON TV)
You see since the best advice is
almost always of the confidential
variety now the tapes have been made
public people are unlikely ever to
feel comfortable speaking in
confidence at the White Housethey
are less likely to offer that advice
so in the end it’s the whole political
systemand by implication the country
that suffers

Cmon David shut him up Change the
line of attack

Miraculously as if FROST had heard him

to stop him rambling

FROST
It’s all right - these are just
introductory exchanges

BIRT
But this session only lasts two hours -
nearly half of it’s gone And you’re
wasting valuable material The moment

should be scoring points with that

sipping Courvoisier and together we
began to reminisce about some of the
great decisions wed participated in
China the Soviet Union the peace
settlement in Vietnam - plus
domestically of course huge strides
had been made in racial desegregation
and he said “Mr President I want
you to know it’s a crime you’re
leaving office a disservice to the
peace in the world that you helped
build and history is going to record
that you were a great President” Then
his voice broke Now I can’t stand
seeing someone cry

RESTON
You’re going to see me cry soon

NIXON
And so I started to cry too But when
I say ‘crying’ I don’t mean sobbing
or anything like that But there we
were Two grown men whod between
them seen the mountain tops and many
of the great crises of their times
And I put my arm around him and I
said“Let me tell you something Ive
never told anyone Whenever Ive had a
tough decision to make I’ve come into
this room for the purpose of praying
So if you don’t mind could we just
have a moment of silent prayer” So we
knelt down In front of that table
where Lincoln signed the Emancipation
Proclamation

In the observation room BIRT closes his eyes “Oh no”

DAVIS the STUDIO MANAGER counts down ‘Five four

FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) -— 82407

FROST
Mr President you came to office
promising peace but no sooner did you
get into the White House than US
involvement in Vietnam deepened - and
the war was prolonged with calamitous
consequences Did you feel youd
betrayed the people that had elected
you

NIXON
You know Mr Frost I’m an even-—
tempered man but nothing upsets me
more than when I hear blame for
Vietnam being laid at my door
Vietnam was not my fault It was my
inheritance Of course I could have
‘bugged out’ blamed it on my
predecessors and pulled the troops
out early and very possibly won some
Scandinavian peace prize into the
bargain but this was an important
test of American credibility The
whole world was watching to see if we
have the “character” to see it
through But I believed in the cause
And sometimes what you believe in is
the harder path It could be said I
was the last casualty of Vietnam

INT FROST TEAM OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY - BIRT leans forward

BIRT
-Cambodia come on David

FROST (ON MONITOR)
«and Cambodia

INT TV SET - MONARCH BAY - SAME TIME - A flicker behind NIXON’s eyes

NIXON
Yes and Cambodia

FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407

FROST
An invasion which everyone advised you
against All the Pentagon and CIA
intelligence suggested it would fail
So why did you do it

NIXON
Well first of all as a result of our
incursion into Cambodia we picked up
22000 rifles 15 million rounds of
ammunition 150000 rockets and
mortars belonging to the North
Vietnamese which would only otherwise
have been directed onto American
soldiers or innocent South Vietnamese
civilians Now I can’t put a finger
on the amount of lives that saved I
just know that as a result our
casualties went down and we were able
to step up our withdrawal

FROST
But one of the principal
justifications you gave for the
incursion was the supposed existence
of the “Headquarters of the entire
Communist military operation in South
Vietnam” a sort of “Bamboo Pentagon”
which proved not to exist at all

NIXON
Now just a minute

FROST
And by sending B52’s to carpet bomb a
country Wiping out whole civilian
areas you end up radicalizing a once
moderate people uniting them in Anti-
American sentiment and creating a
monster in the Khmer Rouge which would
lead to civil war and genocide

INT TV SET - MONARCH BAY - DAY - 117

Violent distressing news footage fills several monitors on
the setof devastated Cambodian villages South Vietnamese
soldiers clinging to the skids of American helicopters

NIXON watches it But as soon as the VT tape ends he turns
on FROST Imperious Defiant

NIXON
Lookit was never US policy to kill
civilians That’s the enemy’s way And
if you’re asking the question do I
regret the casualties on both sides in
the war Of course I do I
experienced real difficulties at home
as you know as a result With the
universities and so forth I attended
a judicial conference in Williamsburg
Virginia late in 1970 and as I walked
into the hall to make a speech a
little girl I don’t think she was
more than 16 broke through the line
of people there and ahshe just
spat in my face just covered my face
with spit and she said “You are a
murderer” Of course I wiped the spit
off went in and made the speech And
I was thinking she was such a pretty
girl but at that moment she was so
ugly and it was the war that had made
her so I lost a great deal of sleep
over that particular incident And the
worry the responsibility let me tell
you it can wear you down But
whenever I had doubts I remembered
the construction worker in
Philadelphia who came up to me and
said “Sir I have only one criticism
of that Cambodia thing If you had
gone in earlier you might have
captured the gun that killed my boy
three months ago So in answer to
your question do I regret going into
Cambodia No I wish I’d gone in
sooner And harder

At that the STUDIO MANAGER walks on and calls ‘time’ The

FROST
Better

BIRT
It was Unquestionably better

FROST
I assumed a more challenging position
like you said Was more conscious of
my body language Asked what I thought
were more penetrating questions And
didn’t allow him to ramble quite as
much

RESTON
But his replies were still too long
Ten minutes instead of twenty And you
werent scoring where you had to

FROST flashes with irritation

FROST
Can we make that ‘we’ Jim ‘We’
werent scoring where ‘we’ had to I
think that would help

ZELNICK
And on Cambodia a development of the
war so morally repugnant so utterly
unjustifiable you let him go on and
onand without being challenged some
of his justifications almost sound
reasonable

masterclass in geo-politics and the benefits of diplomacy

RESTON (V0O)
I remember when it had come to working
out the order we would be taping the
sessions - I had always argued that we
tape the Foreign Policy last

NIXON (ON SCREEN)
-detente as I understand it or
modern diplomacy or political
friendship is a procedure whereby
leaders of the major powers having
gotten to know one another personally
over time can settle disputes
diplomatically - in conversation -
before reaching a flashpoint

RESTON
My reason was simple Nixon was always
going to shine in that arena and the
last thing we wanted was that he take
that increased confidence into the all-
important abuse of power sessions

Are you nuts Let me tell you how bad
things were today After the taping
finished I overheard two crew members
saythey never voted for him when
they had the chance But if he ran for
office again today he’d get their
support Youre making him look
Presidential for Chrissakes And
forget the trivia Who cares whether
Nixon took the White House bed to
Europe when he travelled

goes to answer it When he speaks it’s with a quiet
defeated voice

FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407

FROST
Looking back over your final year in
office do you feel you ever
obstructed justice or were part of a
conspiracy to cover-up or obstruct
justice

NIXON gathers himself

NIXON
No I don’t And I’m interestedyou
use the term ‘obstruction of justice’
You perhaps have not read the statute
with regard to the obstruction of
justice

FROST
As it happens I have

NIXON
You have you say Well then you’11
know it doesn’t just require an act
It requires a specific corrupt
motive And in this case I didn’t have
a corrupt motive What I was doing was
in the interests of political
containment

FROST
Be that as it may the direct
consequences of your actions would
have been that two convicted burglars
would have escaped criminal
prosecution How can that NOT be a
cover-up or obstruction of justice

NIXON
I think the record shows Mr Frost
that far from obstructing justice - I
was actively facilitating it When Pat
Grey of the FBI called me on July 6th
I said “Pat go right ahead with your
investigation” Hardly what youd call
obstructing justice

FROST
That may be But for two weeks prior
to July 6th we now know you were
desperately trying to contain or block
the investigation
FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407 93A

NIXON
Now hang on
FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407

FROST

Obstruction of justice is obstruction
of justice - if it’s for a minute or
five minutes And it’s no defence to
say that your plan failed I mean if
I try to rob a bank and fail that’s
no defence I still tried to rob that
bank

NIXON
Now wait a minute Mr Frostthere
is no evidence of any kind

FROST
-»the reason there is no evidence is
because eighteen and a half minutes of
the conversation with Bob Haldeman
from this June period have
mysteriously been erased

NIXON
An unfortunate oversight But Bob
Haldeman is a rigorous and
conscientious note taker And his
notes are there for all to see

FROST

than his notes

Theres one conversation with Charles
Colson in particular which I don’t

learned of the break-in on June 23rd

falsehood In it you say to Colson
This whole investigation rests unless

Thats the problem”

begins to talk

NIXON is clearly rattled now He reaches for the handkerchief
beside the table

FROST
Then moving onto a conversation you
had with John Dean on March 21st the
following year in one transcript
alone in black and white I picked
out One “You could get a million
dollars and you could get it in cash
I know where it could be gotten” Two
Your major guy to keep under control
is Hunt” Three “Don’t we have to
handle the Hunt situation” Four “Get
the million bucks It would seem to me
that would be worthwhile” Five
Dont you agree that youd better get
the Hunt thing going” Six “First

ought to be handled” Seven “The
money can be provided Ehrlichman
could provide the way to deliver it

Now it seems to me that someone
running a cover-up couldn’t have
expressed it more clearly than that
Could they

NIXON
Look Let me stop you right there
Youre doing something here which I am
not doing and I will not do
throughout these broadcasts You’re
quoting me out of context out of
order

FROST
You have always maintained that you
knew nothing about any of this until
March 21st But in February your
personal lawyer came to Washington to
start the raising of 219000 of hush
money to be paid to the burglars You
seriously expect us to believe you had
no knowledge of that

NIXON
None I believed the money was for
humanitarian purposes to help
disadvantaged people with their
defences

FROST
It was being delivered on the tops of
phone booths with aliases and at
airports by people with gloves on
That’s not normally the way lawyers’
fees are delivered

NIXON
Well Ive made statements to this
effect before All that was Haldeman
and Ehrlichman’s business I knew
nothing
FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) — 82407 97

FROST
All right if Haldeman and Ehrlichman
were really the ones responsible when
you subsequently found out about it
why didn’t you call the police and
have them arrested Isn’t that just a
cover-up of another kind

NIXON is struggling for air His face is ravaged

NIXON
Maybe I should’ve done Maybe I
shouldve called the Feds into my
office and said “Here are the two
men Haul them down to the dock
fingerprint them and throw them into
the can” But I’m just not made that
way These men Haldeman and
Ehrlichman I knew their families
Known them since they were just kids
And I’ve always maintained - what they
were doing - what we were ALL doing
was not criminal When you‘re in
office you have to do a lot of things
that are not in the strictest sense
of the law legal But you do them
because they’re in the greater
interests of the nation

FROST
Wait a minutedid I hear right Are
you really saying that there are
certain situations where the President
can decide whether it’s in the best
interests of the nation and do
something illegal

NIXON
I‘m saying that when the President
does it that means its not illegal

FROST
I’m sorry

NIXON
That’s what I believe But I realize
no one else shares that view

FROST leans forward

FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407 98

FROST
So in that casewill you accept
thento clear the air once and for
allthat you were part of a cover-
up and you did break the law

The STUDIO MANAGER cues FROST who leans in ruthlessly close
Exactly where they left off

FROST
Mr President we were talking about
the period March 21st to April 30th
About the mistakes youd made and so
on I’m wonderingwould you go
further than mistakes The word that
seems not enough for people to
understand

NIXON
Well what word would you express

FROST
All right Since youve asked me

FROST throws down his clip-board

FROST
there are three things the American
People would like to hear you say
One there was probably more than
Mistakes There was wrongdoing - yes
it might have been a crime too
Secondly I did abuse the power I had
as President And thirdly I put the
American people through two years of
agony and I apologize for that And I
know how difficult it is for anyone to
admit that - most of all you But I
just feel if you don’t you’d regret
it the rest of your life
FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407 101A

NIXON’s face a flicker behind the eyes
FROSTNIXON (Yellow Revs) - 82407 102

NIXON
It’s true I made mistakes Horrendous
ones - ones that were not worthy of a
President Ones that did not meet the
standards of excellence that I always
dreamed of as a young boy But if you
remember it was a difficult time Id
been caught up in a “five front war”
against a partisan media a partisan
House of Congress a partisan Ervin
Committee

But NIXON tails off as he catches himself

NIXON
But yes I’d have to admit there were
times I did not fully meet that
responsibility andwas involved in
a ‘cover up’ as you call it And for
all those mistakes I have a very deep
regret I still insist they were
mistakes of the head not mistakes of
the heartbut they were my mistakes
and I don‘t blame anyone else I
brought myself down I gave them a
sword And they stuck it inand they
twisted it with relishand I guess
if I’d been in their position I’d
have done the same

FROST
And the American People

NIXON
I let them down I let down my
friends I let down the country Worst
of all I let down our system of
government and the dreams of all those
young people that ought to get into
government but now think it’s too
corrupt I let the American people
down and I have to carry that burden
with me for the rest of my life My
political life is over

from time to time At one party or
another In his crowds of air-kissing

it was tough to tell where the
politics stopped and the showbiz
started

CAROLINE is left alone She watches FROST in his element

anyone
