FADE IN

A ceiling fan spinning slow and sad above us

INT APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- MORNING

MARNIE MINERVINI (60s) stares at the ceiling tucked in her
side of the bed a chasm of empty space beside her She
sighs forgotten Then turns to the window Looks out at
the California sun And immediately brightens

She props herself up and out of bed

MARNIE (VO)
Anyway

Her chipper BrooklynJersey accent rings out

INT WEST HOLLYWOOD - APPLE STORE -- DAY
Marnie makes her way through the store happy and confused

MARNIE (VO)
Today I went across the street to
the Apple store and got one of the
new iPhones with the 64 gigabytes
cause I wasn’t sure if I should get
the 16s or the 64s but the 64s
looked good so there you go

EXT THE GROVE -- LATER
Marnie has breakfast with her iPhone

MARNIE (VO)
The genius bartender showed me how
to make things bigger but I already
forgot God my eyesight is so
shot But I got on the Safari
before and I looked up The Palazzo
and it said they filmed “The Hills”
here for two seasons Isnt that
neat

-- Marnie happily weaves through The Grove’s morning crowd

MARNIE (VO)
And they used to do the Extra
program at The Grove every day with
Mario Lopez He seems nice
-- Marnie stands shyly at the fountain watching the children
play nearby

MARNIE (VO)
I swear I could stand there and
watch that fountain for hours
Today they played “Come Fly With
Me and I almost started crying
thinking about Daddy But I didnt
cause basically I feel great

-- Marnie buys a Wetzel Pretzel

MARNIE (VO)
Its like living on Main Street in
Disneyland Every day is sunny and
I wake up and I think “Thank you
Joey for making it possible

-- The trolley man rings the bell Marnie scuttles out of the
way packages from Crate and Barrel in her arms

MARNIE (VO)
I swear if I get hit by that
trolley Ill die happy

Marnie puts pillows still tagged on her small couch

MARNIE (VO) (CONTD)
And just wait ‘til you see my
apartment

-- Marnie has a cup of decaf at the kitchen table

MARNIE (VO)
I have a balcony thats far enough
from other peoples’ balconies so
nobody could jump down from the
roof or whatever

-- Marnie looks off her small balcony eyeing suspicious

MARNIE (VO)
And I have a parking spot right
next to the elevator so I can just
run right in there

-- Underground Marnie sprints from her Toyota toward the
elevator bags in hand
MARNIE (VO)
And I got everything shipped out
from Jersey All my artwork

-- Marnie hangs up a local-artist painting of Kermit the Frog
playing guitar in the woods

MARNIE (VO)
The doll I had made of you

-- Marnie sets out a HANDMADE DOLL replicated to look like
her DAUGHTER as a little kid next to a matching photo

MARNIE (VO)
And of course the pictures of me
and Daddy on our honeymoon

-- She slides a photo in her mirror A YOUNGER MARNIE and
her HANDSOME ITALIAN HUSBAND when he was alive

was crazy

Marnie tsks sadly then whispers to Heaven

MARNIE
Sorry Joey

LORI

LORI (CONTD)
You can’t just give someone a man’s
bonsai and orchid and put all this
pressure on them

MARNIE
You let the orchid die too

LORI
Yes “I let it die” I watered it
every day

MARNIE

Oh Lor you’re not supposed to

INT HOSPITAL WAITING AREA -- LATER 18

Marnie sits among the sick and injured filling out a
volunteer form She writes in her name and address She
puts down Lori as her emergency contact She stops at

A HOMELESS WOMAN (40s) coughs loudly across from her Marnie
looks up and gives a polite smile

HOMELESS WOMAN
The demons are chasing me With
their dicks

MARNIE
Oh Well that must be scary

HOMELESS WOMAN

MARNIE

Marnie puts down her volunteer form And makes her way
toward the VENDING MACHINES She weaves in between patients
and their ailments Someone coughs Someone cries

hearing the TELEVISION playing the NEWS above her

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (ON TV)

skeletal remains were found
Police suspect this could be the
work of a serial killer thats been
targeting young women in the area
since 2005

HOMELESS WOMAN (0OS)

Marnie jumps startled as the homeless woman takes the soda
and disappears Marnie looks around at all the people in

She quickly bursts out of the hospital doors

INT LORI’S HOUSE -- MORNING 19
Marnie unlocks the door with a key holding a brown bag

MARNIE
Lori

There’s no answer Marnie greets the dogs then rounds the
corner into the bedroom --

MARNIE (CONTD)
Don’t you get the mail anymore

shower curtain

LORI
Jesus Mom I was shaving You

MARNIE
But I have the key

LORI
Well what if I had company

Marnie looks at the TV A TEEN SOAP plays MUTED ON TV
HANDSOME ACTOR (30s) charms a PRETTY ACTRESS (20s)

MARNIE
Your friends at the baby shower

Lori disappears behind the curtain again

LORI (0S)
Please don’t talk to my friends
okay They’re not my friends And
you’re not supposed to plus one
when there isn’t a one to plus

MARNIE
Well you never told me if you were
going or not Did you get my
message about the serial killer
He’s been all over Southern
California targeting young women

LORI (0S)
Well we should be fine then

MARNIE
Maybe we should have a system in
place like if you let me know
every time you’re leaving the house
and then text me when you get home

LORI (0S)
That’s crazy

MARNIE
Just until the guy is caught And
if you ever run into him remember
“Eyes Throat Crotch”

LORI (0S)
Mom maybe you shouldn’t just drop
by here all the time

MARNIE
But I barely see you

Marnie looks at Lori’s computer and does a quick scan of
Lori’s SEARCH HISTORY In reverse order

Jacob Mailer girlfriend 2015 Jacob Mailer girlfriend
Jacob Mailer weird color stool green stool least
painful suicide how much valium does it take to kill
yourself adoption agencies LA adoption

LORI (0S)
I just have a ton of work to do
And it requires a lot of research

Lori shuts off the faucet Marnie quickly moves away from
the computer and sits on the bed as Lori wraps herself in a
robe and steps out They look at each other

LORI (CONTD)
I’m just saying I’m in no shape to
be entertaining right now I don’t
have any good stories

MARNIE
Is there anything you want to talk
about

Lori rushes into the living room Marnie follows

LORI

Didn’t you hear what I just said
What I need to do is write okay
This is my office This is my
desk

(gesturing to couch)
These are my coworkers

(gesturing to dogs)
If I was in a real office you
wouldn’t just come in and sit on my
desk and pet my coworkers would
you

Marnie tries to answer correctly

MARNIE
No

Lori takes a breath
LORI
I’ve been talking to my therapist
about it and I think we need to
establish certain boundaries

Marnie tries to hide how much this hurts

MARNIE
Sure I get it You need to work
I’1l get out of your office

Marnie starts out Lori feels guilty immediately

LORI
You don’t have to leave right now

MARNIE
No it’s fine Wouldn’t want to
cross peoples’ boundaries

20 INT THERAPIST’S OFFICE -- LATER

Marnie sits across from DIANE (40s) perched in a papasan
chair Next to her a desk and a RABBIT in a cage

MARNIE

And I just think she’s never gonna
get over him if she keeps giving
him what he wants You know And
I think she’d feel better if she at
least you know tried to get over
him but she just seems so angry
all the time I mean you’ve been
seeing her for awhile did she
always seem so angry

(no response)
I just don’t want her to hurt
herself or anything I mean has
she talked to you about that I’m
not saying I want to know anything
I just hope that if she’s talking
to you she’s talking to you about
the right stuff and that you know
you tell her not to hurt herself or
anything And that she should quit
smoking grass I mean I know
she’s in some stage of grief or
something

DIANE
And what about you

MARNIE
What about me

DIANE
How do you feel

MARNIE
Well I feel like she should find
other ways to make herself feel
better besides marijuana

DIANE
I mean how do you feel since your
husband died

MARNIE

Oh Well of course I get sad
But I don’t think I’m as stressed
as Lori is cause I don’t have to
worry about a career or money I
mean Joey left me set for life so
really I can do anything Like
when I go to an action movie I
always buy three tickets One for
me one for Joe and one for my
mother and I don’t have to worry
about it I mean I spend a lot of
time by myself and sometimes I
don’t really know what to do with
the hours in the day so I call
Lori but it’s not like she really
wants my advice or like I have
anything important to say

(adrift then)
But basically I feel fine I love
my apartment And of course you
can’t beat this weather I mean
who doesn’t love The Grove It’s
like living on Main Street in
Disneyland

Marnie smiles Diane reaches for her notepad

INTEXT PALAZZO APARTMENTS -- VARIOUS

Marnie spruces the dead bonsai out on the balcony trying

safe Oh and remind me to tell you
what your therapist said

more about the serial killer called “Red Ripper” Marnie
tsks at the gruesome crime photos

22 INT BLD RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 22

Marnie and Lori sit across from each other both dressed in
black surrounded by Valentine’s Day decorations

MARNIE
It’s so good to see you out of the
house And for such a nice
occasion

Lori reaches for her drink Marnie reaches for the bread

MARNIE (CONTD)
Mmmmm Pretzel bread reminds me
of my father Well pretzels
(then to Heaven)
And I got risotto for Daddy

Lori downs her drink Marnie munches

MARNIE (CONTD)
If Daddy saw me eating like this
you know what he’d say
(bad Italian accent)
“Marnie you’re killing yourself”

LORI
(trying to be funny)
Well you got the last laugh

Marnie smiles but doesn’t laugh Lori clears her throat

LORI (CONTD)
So listen I have to go to New
York for a few weeks To shoot the
pilot
MARNIE
New York Why

LORI
Well cause the show is set there
so it’s actually a good thing But
I wanted to tell you that I’m not
gonna be reachable like at all
for a few weeks Like someone else
will be holding my phone for me
But I was thinking at the end of
it maybe you could come visit the
set and we can finally think about
getting a headstone for Dad Or at
least maybe figure out what to do
with his ashes

MARNIE
Sure we can talk about all that
before you go There’s no rush

LORI
Well I leave tomorrow

MARNIE
Tomorrow
(sinking in)
That’s really soon

LORI
I know But if you want to come
over after dinner and help me pack
and maybe even crash so you could
take me to the airport in the
morning that’d be fun

MARNIE
Well of course but are you sure
you don’t want me to come with you
I could be like your assistant

LORI
(quick)
No No if anything I’d need you
here Watching the house and
taking care of your grand-dogs

Marnie sighs

LORI (CONTD)
It’s my job Mom

MARNIE
No of course You’re right
That’s great news

LORI
It is And it’s really good timing
for me you know I can get out of
town and be busy and finally take
my mind off things

Marnie suddenly gasps

MARNIE
Jacob

LORI
Exactly--

Then Lori follows Marnie’s wide eyes to see JACOB (30s) the
handsome actor we recognize from TV He comes toward them
holding hands with a VERY TALL GIRL (20s) SOMEONE stops
himthem for a picture They finally reach the table

JACOB
Hey you two

LORI

JACOB

spend Valentine’s Day alone

MARNIE
And I didn’t want her to be alone

LORI

MARNIE
That’s right We’re here together

LORI

If I could be stuffed into a cannon

and shot into space

MARNIE

Lori screams into a pillow
MARNIE (CONTD)

Why don’t we go to a waterpark this

LORI

MARNIE

LORI
I can’t live here anymore Mom
There’s no safe place My TV is
haunted My job is make believe
And just when I wanted to hit the
eject button you move here

MARNIE
What does that mean

LORI
It means I tried to book a session
with my therapist to talk about my
mother and I couldn’t Because my
mother was there

MARNIE
You said maybe I should talk to her
after Daddy died So

LORI
Don’t you understand that eighty
percent of the time my phone rings
it’s you The phone rings and I
think it could be a guy or a friend
or a job and it’s my mother
Almost every single time Do you
understand how terrible that makes
me feel

Marnie blinks stung

Lori suddenly breaks down sobbing

MARNIE
Well I could call you less Like
if I don’t hear back from you I
could just text you

LORI
I’m never gonna get over him

MARNIE
How can I help What can I do

LORI

I swear I’m like the only one of
my friends without full-time help
And in this town it literally cost
more than my salary to hire a
decent nanny So I quit And now
I’m home all day All day every
day Isn’t that right Tehya

Tehya screams

MARNIE
You could go into the nanny
business

Jillian looks at Marnie and cracks up laughing

JILLIAN
Oh my god That’s like the
funniest thing ever said ever
(MORE)

JILLIAN (CONTD)
No wonder Lori’s so funny Well
not anymore but

Marnie reaches out to Tehya but she runs off to the other
side of the room to eat her bagel

JILLIAN (CONTD)
It’s just nobody ever tells you how
lonely it is Like some days I
don’t think I talk to another grown
person the entire day Like by the
time Dani gets home I can’t even
turn off the baby talk

MARNIE
Well that’s normal

JILLIAN
Really

MARNIE
But just think someday you and
Tehya will be having like real

conversations You could talk
about everything Like me and
Lori

JILLIAN

Yeah You’re right I don’t know
why I worry so much like I’m not
doing it right Like at any moment
I’m gonna do the thing that gives
her a body complex or a foot
fetish I don’t know I lost my
mom when I was young so I’m
kinda flying blind

Jillian lets out a laugh Marnie stops

MARNIE
Oh yeah Lori said something
about that I’m sorry
(then)
Well anytime you need a baby-
sitter you can call on me

Jillian smiles

JILLIAN
Lori’s lucky to have you so close
If she ever has kids My dad
couldn’t even fly in for my fake
wedding I had to walk myself down
the aisle

MARNIE
Aw Why was your wedding fake

JILLIAN
Because It was at City Hall and
we had just found out that the
adoption had gone through and I
told myself that I didn’t care
about having a special day I just
wanted a quickie wedding and we’d
have a real wedding sometime after
we got Tehya home But then I
thought it’d be so selfish to spend
any of the money I’d spend on her
on having a special day so

Marnie looks at Tehya who is slamming a toy phone on the
opposite side of the room

MARNIE
What about Danny Is he working

JILLIAN
She

Marnie tries not to react If anything it’s a thrill

JILLIAN (CONTD)
Yeah Dani’s a chef at Bouchon but
she’s like fifth in line and she
works crazy hours

MARNIE
She does

The wheels are turning in Marnie’s head

MARNIE (CONTD)
Well what if I gave you the money

JILLIAN
What

Marnie turns back to her

MARNIE
Well I can gift a certain amount
of money to a person per year
without having to pay taxes I
mean I don’t know if it’s enough
to make the wedding of your dreams
but thirteen thousand dollars

JILLIAN
Marnie that’s crazy

MARNIE
What’s crazy I have it You need
it Can’t have it sitting there

JILLIAN
You should save it Spend it on
yourself I mean wouldn’t Lori be
upset

MARNIE
Why She’s not getting married

JILLIAN
I just I mean why would you
want to do that

MARNIE
Cause It sounds romantic Like
renewing your vows Joe and I
talked about that I mean who
doesn’t love love

Jillian bursts into tears and leaps into Marnie’s arms

JILLIAN
Oh my God this is so totally
amazing Of course you’re gonna be
in on all the planning

MARNIE
Well only as much as you’d want
What do you think you’1ll want

JILLIAN
Oh I don’t know nothing
extravagant Dani was in the
Navy so maybe it could be a
nautical theme

MARNIE
Yes You could wear a sailor dress
and she could wear her uniform
Like Officer and a Gentleman
(she gasps)
You could do it on a submarine

CLOSE on Marnie’s face More excited than the “bride-to-be”

INT APPLE STORE -- DAY 32
Freddy helps Marnie look up things on an iPad

FREDDY
I don’t see any submarines for
rent But there are a bunch of

Del Rey

MARNIE

FREDDY

Looks like it
Marnie magnifies the screen squinting at the boat image

MARNIE
Oh Freddy you really are a genius

Freddy smiles Marnie squints at the boat price

MARNIE (CONTD)
Jeez ten thousand dollars for just
the venue

Marnie clicks a few buttons

MARNIE (CONTD)

these for my daughter Could you
ring me up another iPad

FREDDY

Freddy smiles at her generosity Then

FREDDY (CONTD)
So I decided to take your advice

She looks up

MARNIE
You’re gonna be a lawyer

FREDDY
Well no but I’m gonna go back
to school Well night school
Maybe engineering or programming
see how far I get And work’1ll pay
for my classes so

MARNIE
Oh Freddy You took my advice

Marnie looks at him smiling proud marveling Then

FREDDY
Yeah Now I just have to figure
out my work schedule And the bus
schedule

MARNIE
You don’t have a car

FREDDY
Well my mom uses it for work
It’s okay I like taking the bus
You get to meet a lot of freaky
people

Marnie doesn’t like the sound of that

MARNIE
I could take you When is it

FREDDY
What do you mean

MARNIE
I’m in the neighborhood Plus
youre always helping me out here
Itd be my way of paying you back

She hands him her credit card He swipes it She slides it
back in her rubber-banded stack of cards We see her
husbands driver’s license on top of the pile

MARNIE (CONTD)
We wouldn’t have to take the
freeway would we

FREDDY
We can avoid it
(then)
But are you sure It’s pretty
late

MARNIE
It’s okay

She stares at the image of the boat

INT JILLIAN’S HOUSE -- DAY 43

from the baby shower ELAINE Marnie seems distracted lost
in thought as they sift through online footage of various
wedding bands

JILLIAN
Unless you want like to spend a
million bucks bands suck They
just suck

ELAINE
My sister had this Police cover
band for her wedding It hada
lady singer

Elaine shows Jillian the band photo on her phone

JILLIAN
She’s too pretty

MARNIE
Maybe a DJ is more fun cause then
you get to hear the real people
sing the songs Or what if you got
a karaoke machine and then
everybody just gets up throughout
the celebration to sing dedicated
songs to you

ELAINE
No you have to get a band

Tehya wanders up to Marnie Marnie immediately shifts her
attention to playing with Tehya

JILLIAN
I don’t know The venue is already
so expensive Maybe we should just
pare this down Stop all this
planning We don’t even have to
meet up really We can do most
of this over the phone--

MARNIE
No

Jillian turns to Marnie

MARNIE (CONTD)
I mean what if we start off by
having a string quartet play when
you come down the aisle Then we
have a DJ playing records while
everybody eats We get a kick-ass
band for the big dance party spare
no expense And it might be fun
to have a four-piece playing at the
front of the boat the entire night
Like in “Titanic”

Jillian looks at her overwhelmed

MARNIE (CONTD)

Come on This could be the only
wedding I get to be a part of I
say we blow it out

Marnie puts her hand out Jillian beams She puts her hand
on Marnie’s hand And they start laughing Elaine puts her
hand in the mix too And they all squeal and scream

MARNIE (CONTD)
And we know who the flower girl is

They all tickle Tehya Tehya laughs with glee The sound of

FREDDY
No My brother He sends me an
email saying he wants to see me
I’m not even talking to him and
he’s still telling me what to do

trouble man Ever since we were
kids It’s like as soon as I get
something good going he tries to
wreck it

(frustrated sound)
He bailed me out one time and I’ve
been paying for it ever since

She pulls over OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL

MARNIE

You know Freddy sometimes I think
it looks like a person doesn’t care
as much but really they’re just
not as strong as you

(then)
I bet it’d make your mother happy
if you gave him another chance

Freddy exhales really listening

FREDDY
Yeah okay

He shuts the door and walks off to class Marnie looks
pleased with her advice She waits until he gets safely

JILLIAN

Well don’t fall in love with it

Oh Jillian

Marnie stands and comes towards her

MARNIE (CONTD)
You really look beautiful

They look in the mirror together

MARNIE (CONTD)
Do you love it

JILLIAN
Well of course but

RIP Marnie rips the price-tag off of the dress The women

MARNIE
Anyway I hope you’re having a good
time

Marnie spots a YELLOW SIGN on a telephone pole TO SET She
immediately follows the sign’s arrow

MARNIE (CONTD)
I’m kind of dying to hear about
everything I miss you

Suddenly a RIGHT ARROW TO SET Marnie tries to change
lanes looking over her shoulder--

MARNIE (CONTD)
But basically I feel fine so give

MARNIE (CONTD)
(into phone)
Okay love you

She hangs up

EXT THERAPIST’S OFFICE -- DAY

Marnie gets dropped off in a TAXI CAB

INT THERAPIST’S OFFICE -- LATER

Marnie sits across from Lori’s therapist again
the Crate and Barrel shopping bags

MARNIE
And then I realized that Freddy
doesn’t have anyone to help him
with his studying So I found out
what classes he’s taking and what
books they’re using at the school
and I found them on Amazon for half
the price so you know I could
help him with his studying

DIANE
And why do you think you’re helping
him

MARNIE
Freddy Well he lives in a poor

neighborhood and his mother works
full time and all he really wants
is an education

DIANE
And what about Jillian

MARNIE
Well she didn’t get to have a
proper lesbian wedding and I have
the money so I figured well I
could do that

surrounded by

DIANE
What’s Jillian’s last name

Marnie stops giving it real thought

MARNIE
I think it starts with a G Ora
K It’s definitely a consonant

DIANE
A consonant

Marnie looks at the rabbit in the cage on the desk The
rabbit looks back

DIANE (CONTD)

Marnie do you think there’s some
part of you that feels guilty that
you have your husband’s money

Like you received this consolation
prize that you don’t know what to
do with Or is there a part of you
that thinks that maybe money is the
way to save everybody Or possibly
even a way to stay in peoples’
lives and be needed And maybe
your relationship with Freddy and
Jillian is all a way of replacing
your own daughter and husband

Marnie looks at her

56 INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 56
Marnie fluffs the many stuffed animals around the old woman

MARNIE

(scoffing)
And I told her I said I don’t
need to replace anybody And why
should I feel guilty for Joe’s
money He came from nothing and
worked his whole life for it He
would’ve wanted me to put it to
good use Like Cinderella
Bippity-boppity-boo But she just
kept saying all this stuff and
asking all the questions And I
was like you’re a therapist
aren’t you supposed to listen

Marnie then fluffs the pillow under the woman’s head She
looks up at Marnie grateful

MARNIE (CONTD)
You know this hospital is one of
the best in the country My
husband died here so you’re in
really good hands

The woman slowly raises her arm and points her finger at
Marnie Marnie looks at it

MARNIE (CONTD)
ET phone home

Marnie smiles and puts her finger on the woman’s finger The
woman begins to make small half circles again tracing the
sky Marnie’s finger moves with it

The old woman’s eyes are fixated on Marnie but she’s

stirring inside trapped in her body Marnie looks back
also stirring

OMITTED 57

Marnie looks petrified unsure how to respond when

FREDDY
Whoa look at this Is this yours

Freddy tosses his backpack in the car

MARNIE
No Well it was my husbands
So I guess so

Just then Freddy’s twin FREDO (20s) appears at his

FREDO
Got room for one more

FREDDY
Marnie this is my brother Fredo

Marnie’s eyes explode with pleasant surprise

MARNIE
Oh wow it’s so nice to meet you

Ooh what’s that

FREDDY
Executive legislative judicial

MARNIE
Very good

FREDO

Marnie pushes a button and the top goes down

FREDO

Matte black

MARNIE
Ooh that’s an idea

FREDO
(to Freddy )
Hey remember when Tre stole that
car and it turned out to be a

Fredo laughs hard Freddy can’t help but laugh a little
Marnie smiles at them both

FREDO (CONTD)
This is the place

Marnie pulls the car over It’s not a great neighborhood

FREDO (CONTD)
I’1l be two minutes

Fredo takes his backpack and makes his way to a run-down
house Marnie and Freddy wait

FREDDY
Thanks for taking him

MARNIE
Of course It’s just nice to see
the two of you together

They watch as a THUG (20s) opens the door and lets Fredo

in

MARNIE (CONTD)
If you guys want we can stop for
ice cream on the way back

Freddy laughs knowing that’s unlikely

63 INT JOE’S CAR -- LATER 63
Marnie Freddy and Fredo eat ice cream She drives on

FREDO
- Well by then Freddy lost like
thirty pounds and the doctors said
if he didn’t get another kidney
within three months the toxins
would spread through his entire
body and he’d definitely die

MARNIE
Oh my God

FREDO
I said “Mom Freddys the smart
one in the family I’m not worth
saving but he is”
(then to Freddy)
Show her the scar

Freddy rolls his eyes then turns around and shows the scar
on his lower back Marnie marvels at Fredo’s generosity
She turns back to Fredo showing his scar

See we’re not so different

He points ahead

were just these little kids who
looked exactly the same And now
look at you

She pulls ahead

INT JOE’S CAR -- LATER 64
Marnie pulls over in the parking lot of Freddy’s school

MARNIE
And what’s the difference between a
veto and a pocket veto

FREDDY
A pocket veto is when the President
doesn’t sign a bill for ten days
but Congress can’t overrule it

MARNIE
Youre ready Freddy
(laughing)
Ha Ready Freddy

Just then Freddy reaches down and picks something up off the
passenger seat floor trying to hide it

MARNIE (CONTD)
What’s that

Freddy reluctantly shows her what he’s found A plastic bag
filled with weed She looks at it disappointed Then

ORANGE AND BLUE LIGHTS flash behind them

MARNIE (CONTD)
Oh God

A FLASHLIGHT shines on the two of them inside

MARNIE (CONTD)
Cheese it

She looks at Freddy He’s panicking
FREDDY

What do we do What do we do I
can’t get in trouble Not now

A man is coming towards her Marnie thinks fast She takes
the weed by the handful and turns to Heaven

MARNIE
Sorry Joey

Freddy watches as Marnie throws the entire chunk of weed in
her mouth and chews it The man gets closer and closer
Marnie chews faster and faster He’s at the window She
swallows He knocks She lowers the window

MARNIE
Freddy I’m very something right

He shuts the door She looks at him for a stoned beat then
pulls away ever-so-slowly
EXT THE GROVE -- LATER THAT NIGHT 66

-- Marnie wanders The Grove stoned out of her mind The
sights The sounds Everything is vivid alive

-- The fountain is more mesmerizing than ever

INT DUPAR’S -- LATER 70

Marnie sits next to Zipper in the middle of the circle of
COPS some in uniform some detectives all chugging coffee
and talking a mile a minute Marnie is staring at her hands

OFFICER LEE
So we get to the area and sure
enough there’s a naked guy and he’s
just walking down the street
waving in the wind

OFFICER BERNIE
He wasn’t waving He was saluting

The cops crack up The sound echoes through Marnie’s body
She looks up from her hands

OFFICER DAVIS
Anyway he was being real
belligerent and refused to put any
clothes on or get in the car So
Bernie suggested we taze him

OFFICER BERNIE
(throwing up an arm)
What can I say I love tazing

OFFICER DAVIS
So Bernie gets his tazer out and
you know how Bernie’s aim has
always been a little low

ZIPPER
No

Everyone dies of laughter Marnie tries to join them
laughing too hard

OFFICER DAVIS
(laughing shaking)
He would not go down He just
stood there vibrating pointing
north
(turns to Marnie)
Pardon my language

Marnie stop and turns to him

MARNIE
Oh Were you talking

They all look at her then everyone bursts into laughter
Zipper smiles She laughs unsure

EXT DUPARS -- LATER
Zipper opens the door for her She hurries outside

ZIPPER

MARNIE
Well if I had stories like them

under a street-lamp She looks at him knees weakening

MARNIE (CONTD)
Well I better get home

ZIPPER

He climbs

A few other cops start out of Dupar’s toward their COP

Zipper “kick-starts” his Harley with his thumb

She looks

MARNIE
I can’t drive that thing

ZIPPER
(slight laugh)
Okay well how bout just this once
I drive it and you can sit on back

MARNIE
Are you crazy I would kill my
daughter if she died ona
motorcycle

ZIPPER
Oh no this isn’t a motorcycle
This is a Harley Davidson There’s
a world of difference It’s
important that you understand that

ZIPPER (CONTD)
Let me just kick-start her here

ZIPPER (CONTD)
You wanna go on a ride-along

MARNIE

She grips his waist and closes her eyes starting to pray

EXT SANTA MONICA STREET -- LATER 73

Marnie and Zipper are parked behind the cop car Zipper
looks through binoculars at something

ZIPPER

After I retired I used to drive
around listening to the CB just to
see where the action was And then
I started following them around so
the guys said I should just come
along Sort of like unofficial
back-up In case anything goes

wrong

MARNIE
That’s cool So you make your own
hours

He swallows letting her think it’s cool

MARNIE (CONTD)
Were you on the Red Ripper case

ZIPPER
No No but I knew of the guy
following him Hadn’t seen his
family in eight years That’s what
chasing a rabbit will do to you

This hits her She nods letting go of irrational fears
ZIPPER (CONTD)
Took thirty years on the force to
realize you can’t save everybody

He looks through the binoculars

ZIPPER (CONTD)
But you try

Marnie smiles at him

EXT ANOTHER SANTA MONICA STREET -- LATER 74

With a view of the pier Marnie and Zipper sit on a bench
the motorcycle nearby She looks through the binoculars now
like they’re in the last row of an action movie

MARNIE
So why do they call you Zipper

ZIPPER
It’s my last name

MARNIE
Oh well that makes sense What’s
your first name

ZIPPER
Randy Randall

MARNIE
Are you from out here Am I asking
too many questions

He smiles and shakes his head

ZIPPER
I’m from Oxnard originally I
moved to Ventura when I got married
and then I moved to Topanga when I
got divorced

MARNIE
Oh I’m sorry

ZIPPER
Oh don’t be sorry She’s not

He laughs She joins him

ZIPPER (CONTD)
She never smiled with her teeth
You know I should’ve known

Marnie doesn’t know whether or not to smile

MARNIE
Topanga Is that by the beach

ZIPPER
It’s by the beach Not on the
beach

(MORE )

ZIPPER (CONTD)

I wouldn’t mind living on the
beach But I wouldn’t know where
to keep the chickens

MARNIE
Chickens

ZIPPER
Some people have dogs I am a man
with chickens

MARNIE
How many

ZIPPER
You know what they say about
counting chickens

She laughs

ZIPPER (CONTD)

We have a very symbiotic
relationship I give them a coop
and some grass and sometimes a
little Parmesan cheese and they
keep me in eggs

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a blue egg

ZIPPER (CONTD)
This is from the Ameraucana I
only have one Easter Egger

He hands her the blue egg She looks at it up close

MARNIE
I can’t believe it didn’t break

ZIPPER
Yeah she’s a toughie
(then)
You want to meet her

She looks up at him thinking

MARNIE
You mean at your house

ZIPPER
(looks at his watch)
Well she’s been out at the bar all
night but she should be home by
now

She deliberates fighting the voices in her head

EXT ZIPPER’S TOPANGA HOME -- EARLY DAWN 75

Marnie and Zipper walk up to the coop He holds open a
chicken-wire gate and she nervously walks through it She
stands there as Zipper calls to the chickens and spreads out
some feed

ZIPPER
Okay that’s Joan that’s Gertude
that’s Henrietta Don’t let her
sass you She’s got an attitude on
account of being so damn beautiful
Ladies this is Marnie

Marnie shyly waves at them Zipper walks to the other side
of the coop and messes with a boom box an extension cord
extends into the house

ZIPPER (CONTD)
Couple a months back I was
cleaning the coop and playing my
boom box and I looked at their
faces and I swear the chickens
just looked happy So I dida
little experiment to see what kind
of music they dig the most Rock
‘n’ roll makes them lay eggs like
crazy but seems to stress them
out Classical works Reggae does
not But I find for the perfect
balance of productivity and
happiness all roads lead to Dolly

He pushes PLAY on the boom box and a Dolly Parton song plays
Zipper and Marnie stand in the coop

MARNIE
How can you tell if it’s working

ZIPPER
Don’t they look like they’re
smiling

She looks at the chickens They all have different chicken
faces She can’t tell if they’re smiling but she sure is
It gets wider and wider as she moves around the coop two-
stepping out of the chickens’ way It’s almost dancing

76 INT ZIPPER’S HOUSE -- MORNING 76

The sun is just coming up bathing the room in a pink glow
Zipper makes Marnie a cup of coffee in his small kitchen

MARNIE
Well Joe didn’t want to know how
much time he had left But Lori
and I knew So he asked her if she
could throw us our wedding
anniversary in August But she
knew he wouldn’t make it til then
so she said “Why don’t I throw you
a party forty years from the day
you met” So Lori decorated her
house like it was 1969 and all the
music was from 1969 and all her
friends came dressed in 60s clothes
and Joe’s brothers flew out and she
served fondue And it was just the
most spectacular day Like the day
we got married

Marnie smiles Zipper sits across from her

MARNIE (CONTD)
We came out here for his treatments
and then took care of him for
another two months and
(smiling)
Lori said we were in the delivery
business
(hands to Heaven)
Shipping and handling

She forces a smile Zipper can see this is still an open
wound He moves on

ZIPPER
And then you stayed in LA That’s
a pretty big sea change literally
I mean that’s really very brave

MARNIE
Yeah Well who wouldn’t love it
here The sun is always shining
It’s like living on Main Street in
Disneyland

He looks at her For a second too long And smiles

MARNIE (CONTD)
What about you You got kids

ZIPPER
Two beautiful girls

She smiles

ZIPPER (CONTD)
The one who likes me lives far
away And the one that doesn’t is
in Palm Springs

Her smile drops He explains

ZIPPER (CONTD)

Lizzy was still in high school when
her mom and I fell apart which was
mostly my fault 7030 6040
maybe I was working all the time
I brought it home with me And as
soon as she started to slip away I
started gripping and I guess I held
on too tightly And I lost her
Lizzy I mean The younger one

(then)
She’s in a rehab--

(correcting himself)
Program She’s in a program I
was hoping one of those steps would
lead her back here but

(then)
I don’t know I was a hot head
then I let my temper get the best
of me I was too strict Had too
many rules Curfews Made them
scared to tell me things

MARNIE
Well sure Look at everything you
were seeing all day Serial
killers and stuff I just watch
the news Never-mind being a part
of it It’s like an action movie

ZIPPER
(slight scoff)
Well not anymore

MARNIE
Still It’s not your fault the
world is a scary place

She takes a sip of coffee He looks at her She has no idea
how beautiful she looks

MARNIE (CONTD)
Thank God youre retired

He clears his throat almost laughing but not

ZIPPER
Yeah it has its moments I’ve
learned to calm down I meditate
if you can believe that The
chickens keep me in line
Sometimes I hit the bag in the
garage Mostly I just exercise
patience With everything My ex
My girls If Lizzy doesn’t want me
to call her anymore I have to
respect that

MARNIE
(bursting)
No I mean you can’t not call

ZIPPER
I left her messages until it was
full

MARNIE

So I’m sorry I should mind my
own business But you should call
her

ZIPPER
I really wouldn’t know what to say

MARNIE
Just tell her you love her No
matter what she’s up to

(then matter-of-fact)
Everybody knows their mothers love
them unconditionally Fathers have
to say it out loud I think

He smiles Struck by this Her She can suddenly feel the

weight in the air and barrels through it

MARNIE (CONTD)
Joe used to have a temper But he
was Italian so Oh my God what
time is it

EXT LORI’S HOUSE -- EARLY MORNING

Zipper pulls the motorcycle over and Marnie hops off

She

MARNIE
Well thanks

ZIPPER
Okay

He reaches into his wallet and hands her his card Their
hands touch for a flash She quickly puts the card in her
pants pocket
ZIPPER (CONTD)
In case you need to get out of a
speeding ticket or something

She turns and hurries away He watches her go

center of the bread

-- The egg fries in the heat The steam rises up to meet
her She slides the spatula underneath it and flips it at
exactly the right time

-- Marnie sits at the table and cuts into the egg-fried
bread She salts the single bite and puts it in her mouth
It’s so good her eyes roll back

-- Bite after bite it seems to only get better She hasn’t
tasted an egg like this in so long Maybe ever

-- Marnie finishes the last bite wipes her mouth and pounds
a fist on the table as she swallows And exhales Slowly
her expression changes from ecstasy to something like guilt

-- At the sink she scrubs the plate clean shaking her head

INT SILVERCUP STUDIOS -- NOT A GOOD TIMENEXT DAY 85

smiles wide coming in for a long hug Then pulling away

LORI
Okay this is your chair

She sits her mother in a chair

LORI (CONTD)
These are your cans

She hands her mother a pair of headphones

LORI (CONTD)
Don’t talk to anyone And the safe
word is “cantaloupe”

ON A BELL Marnie puts on her headphones already on the
edge of her seat Lori sits behind the DIRECTOR (40s)
Marnie sits behind Lori Marnie peeks around them all to
look at the tiny monitors A and B

A clapboard comes into view
Rolling Set Action

ON THE A-MONITOR A TV DAUGHTER (20s too pretty) says good-
night to a DATE (20s) at the door

TV DAUGHTER
Okay call me Good-night Bye

She shuts the door swooning then walks into the kitchen to
find --

ON THE B-MONITOR The TV MOM (40s too young) sits at the
table eating ice cream from a carton and reading a book

TV DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
Jesus Mom you scared the crap out
of me Don’t you have ice cream in
the guest house

TV MOM
Well yeah but I already picked all
the cookie dough out of it

TV DAUGHTER

Is that my journal

TV MOM
Oh is that what this is I
thought the characters seemed a
little slutty

TV DAUGHTER
Give me that

TV MOM
Aren’t you too old to keep a
journal

TV DAUGHTER
Aren’t you too old to read your
daughter’s journal That’s a
violation of space and time

TV DAD (0S)
What’s all the yelling about

A TV DAD (50s bad Italian accent) enters in nothing but a
towel He fills the frame taking over the B-CAMERA

TV MOM
I violated space and time

TV DAD
You peed in the upstairs shower
too

The director chuckles Lori looks pained But Marnie is
mesmerized The father and daughter talk their images
facing each other on opposite monitors

TV DAUGHTER
What’s wrong with the shower in the
guest house

TV DAD
It started to get this weird smell

SLOW PUSH on Marnie For a moment Joe is alive She
watches without blinking riveted

TV DAUGHTER (0S)
Mom Dad when I said you guys

I didn’t mean here here I need to
get a life I need to meet a guy

Lorraine

DIRECTOR
Aaaaaaand cut

Everyone stands up and starts moving back to work

Lori goes to talk to one of the CAMERA GUYS

But Marnie is frozen in place dazed nostalgic Until

The actor playing the father comes to sit at video village
Marnie is a chair away from him as he checks his phone She

tries not to breathe Then can’t help herself and leans in

MARNIE
You look so much like him

He turns to her No Italian accent

TV DAD

MARNIE
The character you’re playing You

Lori gestures to her mother while over-coughing

INT HOTEI

L BAR -- LATER 86

At a round booth Lori sits in between Marnie and the camera

guy from

Lori’s set BEN (30s) He’s in the middle of a

long animated story

Ben sings

BEN
Indy races through the jungle all
the way back to Jock and the
seaplane Indy screams “Come on
Jock Get going” but the natives
are chasing him to the edge of the
water So Indy grabs onto a vine
and goes swinging through the
air

some theme music Marnie laughs enchanted Lori

takes a big sip of her drink

BEN (CONTD)
Indy hits the water Splewsh
Poison arrows are firing all around
him Pew pew pew pew pew Then
Indy climbs into the seat of the
plane just as it lifts out of the
water and takes to the sky And
that’s when Indy looks down and
sees are you ready a giant
snake in his lap

Marnie gasps

BEN (CONTD)
Indy screams “Jock why is there a
snake on this plane” And Jock
says “Oh that’s just Reggie” And
Indy says “But Jock I hate
snakes” And the plane flies off
into the sunset And thats the
first twenty minutes of “Indiana
Jones and the Raiders of the Lost
Ark”

Marnie claps entertained Lori forces a laugh Ben laughs
the hardest wiping his brow and exhales

MARNIE
I’ve never seen it

BEN
Well we’ll have to watch it before
you leave town

He gives Lori a too-hard squeeze The WAITER brings more
drinks Lori can’t get to hers fast enough

MARNIE
So you guys met on set

LORI
(pointed)
That’s right just two weeks ago
Like I was telling you right before
you invited him to dinner

MARNIE
Well I think it’s romantic
Meeting on a movie set

LORI
People meet on sets all the time
and it’s usually scandalous and
home-wrecking

MARNIE
I knew my husband for two weeks
before he proposed

BEN
Two weeks

MARNIE
I think when you know you know
you know

BEN
I totally agree

He pulls Lori towards him

LORI
I’m gonna run to the bathroom

BEN
Hurry back

Lori slides under the booth and away Ben looks around then
looks back at Marnie with a secret

BEN (CONT’D)
Hey

He gestures for Marnie to lean in As she does he leans
forward and presents an ENGAGEMENT RING in a light-up box

MARNIE
Oh my God

BEN

I got it the day after we met

(then)
I don’t do things half-assed When
I know I want something I go for
it That’s how I got this far in
my career Russell Boyd Rodney
Charters Don McAlpine when the
top cinematographers need a B-
camera operator do you know who
they call

MARNIE
You

He shuts the ring box and leans back

BEN
When you know you know

MARNIE
Wow it’s all so fast But if
it’ll make Lori happy

He leans in too intense

BEN
So I was thinking that we get
everyone she knows all her friends
and family and people she works
with and the entire crew and we put
together one of those Youtube
videos and maybe it starts with
you putting Lori on the back of my
truck and then the radio starts
playing our song

Marnie beams Her eyes couldn’t get any wider

BEN (CONTD)
And everyone she knows comes out
one at a time and does this
choreographed dance number until it
ends with me appearing with the
ring and getting down on one knee
all in one tracking shot

87 INT HOTEL ROOM -- LATER 87

Lori rummages through the mini bar while Marnie sits up in
bed smiling too wide practically vibrating
LORI
I just feel like the whole thing is
getting bastardized by everybodys
notes and the guy playing the dad
is just not up for the challenge
Why are you so hyper

MARNIE
Nothing I’m just excited for you
(then)
And Ben seems nice

LORI
Yeah well don’t get too used to
him Mom it’s not gonna last

MARNIE
(sing-songy)
I wouldn’t be so sure

LORI
No I’m telling you I’m just
rebounding I need to date below-
the-line for a change

MARNIE
You know sometimes people think
they’re having a rebound but then
it evolves into something more
(then)
Actually there’s something I
should tell you

Marnie sits Lori down She takes a breath

MARNIE (CONTD)
I was engaged to someone else
before Daddy

LORI
Yeah I know You told me before

MARNIE
I did

LORI
Yeah his name was Matteo and you
weren’t that attracted to him and
then you went to Atlantic City with
your girlfriends and that’s where
you met Daddy You have like three
stories Mom

MARNIE
Alright So if you’re rebounding
then why don’t you and Jacob give
it another go

Lori gets up downs a quick drink

LORI
That’s not up to me

MARNIE
Well maybe if you just told him
how you feel

LORI
See that is the great lie of your
life Mom That if you dream it
you can do it And the world
doesn’t work that way

MARNIE
What are you talking about You
dreamt you could move to Hollywood
and you did it You dreamt you
could be a writer and you did it
You dream up different stories all
the time

Lori half-smiles It’s almost working

MARFNIE
Which reminds me I met the cutest
girl in the bathroom at JFK She’s
in a wheelchair and she writes a
blog about empowering young women
and I told her you were a writer
and she hadn’t heard of you but she
was really impressed when I told
her youd have coffee with her
sometime and give her some industry
tips Your cell phone’s 323

Lori stops smiling

LORI
I don’t have industry tips

MARNIE
Well it’s just a coffee She’s in
a wheelchair

Lori climbs into bed next to Marnie drink in hand Marnie
has her cell phone out camera on unsure where to aim it

MARNIE (CONTD)
How do you take a selfie

LORI
What do you mean You just take
it You just take a picture of
yourself
(immediately curious)
Who are you sending a selfie to

MARNIE
Nobody Shhhhh

Marnie quickly puts her phone down then grabs the remote

LORI
(playfully)
Do you have a new friend
MARNIE
I said I didn’t want to talk about

it

Lori stifles her happy curiosity as much as she can She
toasts the air takes a sip of her drink and --

INT HOTEL ROOM -- LATER 88

Lori is passed out in bed Marnie pours a tiny bottle of
vodka into a cup and into her mouth Marnie swallows it in
one gulp then reaches for her phone

She squints to see the phone number written on his card
Dials before she changes her mind Straight to voicemail

ZIPPER (0S)
This is obviously me

BEEP Marnie loud-whispers in the dark

MARNIE
Hello Zipper um it’s Marnie
Minervini I’m in New York with my
daughter who is making her TV show

me think of you Well your job

She gestures and hits the table knocking over bottles

MARNIE (CONTD)

Anyway I ordered the scrambled
eggs at the hotel this morning and
they were nothing like what I ate

gave me I had one Briefly So
I just wanted to check in on the

She gasps hanging up as quickly as possible then tosses her
phone out of frame

INT JERSEY HOME -- DAY 89

The door opens and Marnie is pulled in by Joe’s surviving
brothers COS TONY and DOMINIC (60s)

INT JERSEY HOME -- STILL DAY 90

Marnie eats dinner with Joe’s brothers and their wives
ANGIE (60s) is among them

ANGIE
You lost weight

MARNIE
Oh yeah right

ANGIE

Angie dumps food on Marnie’s plate

MARNIE
Ooh Angie ariancini They don’t
have anything like this in Los
Angeles

ANGIE

anything like this anywhere Only
my mother made these and now I make
them and I take the recipe to the
grave

Marnie turns to two other wives

MARNIE
Tina Pina how are you feeling

TINA and PINA (60s) both make hand gestures

cos
Hey how’s the TV show

MARNIE
So funny you wouldn’t believe it
I don’t know where she gets her
characters from

Marnie takes a bite and makes food noises

INT JERSEY HOME -- STILL DAY
They continue to eat and talk loudly

MARNIE
The first time I cooked for Joe I
wanted to make him pasta And my
mother told me that you know if
pasta is done is by throwing it
against the wall and if it sticks
you take it out of the water So I
had the water boiling and I broke
the pasta in half

The Italians let out a collective “ugh”

MARNIE (CONTD)
(laughing)

And then I cooked it and threw it
against the wall and nothing So I
cooked it some more and then a
little bit more until it finally
stuck on the wall and stuck to the
pot and stuck to itself and stuck
to everything it touched

Marnie laughs The group laughs along knowing the story

MARNIE (CONTD)
After he took the first bite I saw
him take a little pasta off of his
plate and put it in his napkin and
I said “What are you doing” And
he said “I just have to show this
to my mother”

They howl with laughter hitting the table Then one by one

they laugh into sighs Marnie is the last wiping away

laughing-tears

TONY
I can’t believe it’s his
anniversary already

MARNIE
I know A whole year

They look at her

DOMINIC
You mean two years

Marnie recovers

MARNIE
Right A year since last year

ANGIE
Time flies

cos
Time flies

TONY
So we were thinking that half of
his ashes could stay with you and
Lori in California and the other
half could be buried in Elizabeth
with our mother and father That
way we all have a place to go

Marnie swirls the food on her plate

MARNIE
Yeah you know I really just want
to talk to Lori about it first
She’s been really sensitive about
it lately and I just don’t want to
cause her too much stress while
she’s doing the tv show

TONY
Well we talked to her and she said
it was up to you

Marnie stops out of excuses

realizes it’s Zipper singing and playing guitar

She stops short listening through the screen door It takes
a moment to recognize the song Dolly Parton’s “To Daddy”

ZIPPER

(singing)
Being took for granted was a thing
that she accepted And she didn’t
need those things to make her happy
She didn’t even seem to notice
That he didn’t kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to
daddy

Marnie mouths along with the lyrics getting lost in the
song She leans against the screen door and it CREAKS The
guitar stops She quickly hangs the bag on the door knob and
starts away The screen door swings open

type sounds coming from inside

base You want to come in let me

make their own happiness but she’s
never been that way Or maybe she
used to be but not anymore And I
don’t know if it’s too late for you

awkward and I’m overstepping my
bounds I know I’m overstepping my
bounds but it doesn’t matter

chance that you could end up with
her and make her happy then
that’s all that matters to me Her
happiness is all that matters So

handful of those pilots makes it to
the air And then only a handful
of those gets to stay on the air

She smiles Then reaches out and takes hold of his hand
His thumb gently rubs hers She interlocks fingers Then

MARNIE
Do you want to go to an action
movie sometime

He looks up at her A smile spreads across his tan face

ZIPPER
Definitely

They look at each other And suddenly slowly they lean in
He kisses her on the mouth gently but with fire behind it
They slowly pull away Their hands slide apart Marnie
turns away walking back to her car smiling the whole way

He watches her go then “kick-starts” his bike and rides off

INT TEHYA’S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 130

in a nearby rocking chair

MARNIE
What should we do You want me to
tell you a story

TEHYA
Yeah

Tehya hands Marnie a book

MARNIE
Oh I know this I used to read it
to my Lori

Tehya peels open the pages and Marnie begins to read

Tehya lies

MARNIE (CONTD)

(reading)
“The Skin Horse had lived longer in
the nursery than any of the others
He was so old that his brown coat
was bald in patches and showed the
seams underneath and most of the
hairs in his tail had been pulled
out to string bead necklaces He
was wise for he had seen a long
succession of mechanical toys
arrive to boast and swagger and by-
and-by break their mainsprings and
pass away and he knew that they
were only toys and would never
turn into anything else For
nursery magic is very strange and
wonderful and only those
playthings that are old and wise
and experienced like the Skin Horse
understand all about it

down in her lap Marnie clears her throat

MARNIE (CONTD)
‘What is REAL’ asked the Velveteen
Rabbit one day ‘Does it mean
having things that buzz inside you
and a stick-out handle’ ‘Real
isnt how you are made said the
Skin Horse ‘Its a thing that
happens to you

(MORE)

MARNIE (CONTD)
When a child loves you for a long
long time not just to play with
but REALLY loves you then you
become Real Does it hurt asked
the Rabbit Sometimes said the
Skin Horse for he was always
truthful When you are Real you
dont mind being hurt Does it
happen all at once like being
wound up he asked ‘or bit by
bit It doesnt happen all at
once said the Skin Horse You
become It takes a long time
Thats why it doesnt happen often
to people who break easily or have
sharp edges or who have to be
carefully kept

She has trouble reading keeping the tears from her eyes

MARNIE (CONTD)
Generally by the time you are
Real most of your hair has been
loved off and your eyes drop out
and you get loose in the joints and
very shabby But these things dont
matter at all because once you are
Real you cant be ugly except to
people who dont understand”

She stops

TEHYA
More

She blinks the tears away then turns to the girl And
smiles Opening up the book again

MARNIE
