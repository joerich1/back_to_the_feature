INT BUS - FRED HARTMAN BRIDGE (RT 146) - DAY 15

Mikey stares at the horizon from the bus window as it
descends the bridge in to Texas City Nothing but refineries
to the north and to the south White smoke and steam billow
in to the air and large flames dance off the flare stacks

Green Rev 2

It’s clear that Mikey is less than enthusiastic to see his
hometown

EXT PORT AUTHORITY - BUS STATION (TEXAS CITY TX) - DAY 16

Mikey exits tired He looks around a moment The station is
directly in front of the refinery -- a labyrinth of rusted
metal consisting of pipes tanks and stacks

EXT TEXAS CITY - STREETS - CONTINUOUS 17
Mikey tiredly walks through the rural run-down neighborhood

It sucks to be back The vacant properties empty storefronts
and overall blighted state of his hometown is all a reminder
of his failures

EXT KWIK STOP - DAY 18

Mikey passes Kwik Stop a dilapidated corner store

EXT LIL’S PLACE - DAY 19

Lil’s place is a small yellow weathered house with
overgrown weeds on the lawn This house rests on the last
block before the refinery property Directly behind the
house a flare stack burns bright at all times

He approaches the front door and instead of knocking pulls
out his cell We stay outside with Mikey on the phone and we
barely hear the person on the other side

MIKEY

Yo Lex It’s Mikey

knowledge that she had sex with
more than one dude at a time
before It was shortly after that
that I threw her in to our first
threesome that she didnt argue
about get mad about nothing

Mikey lies back
