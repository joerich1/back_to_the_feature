lyingsitting on the floor To one side is a PHOTOGRAPHER and
ASSISTANT with equipment set up

to your face or heaving breasts

I dream of nightly between damp sheets
as I run from you and think of Joleen

carrying two beers and a cocktail A young MAN blocks her path

OkayThe next one Id like to share
with you is called Revisited

A camera flashes Lawrence blinks a few times shaking his head as he
thumbs through loose papers dropping one Show the Photographer
working with equipment
LAWRENCE (OS)

Old Town Square a maze of cafes
Change shops offer souvenirs
Moving-walks span Charles Bridge
Charging a dollar a ride

Fairy tale castle on the hill
Licensed to Disneyland

And occupied by a dreamer
Directing from an ivory tower
Built from sweat tears and fear
LAWRENCE (Contd)

As part of his inheritance

Not content with money and mortar
Pen paper and wife

To carry on and tell the tale

He must aspire to greater things

Follow Katka back to a couch and table where DOUG and CHRIS are
sitting

(Doug 30yr-old Englishman with rugged good looks)
(Chris 24yr-old American overweight)

ANGLE a female audience member who is enthraled

ON LAWRENCE

LAWRENCE (Contd)

And from the dungeon climb

To take a place still warm
Exchanging iron clasps for gold
Rags for riches

Stories yet to scribe for him

A camera flashes
LAWRENCE (Contd)

King of scribes

Were it a monarchy but no

He must preside

Over and over again

A nation of ungodly saints

Born again with time to die

The death of a thousand evils

And by their hand theyll claim
Others guided a destiny once more

Enthusiastic applause and yells some people clapping Lawrence moves
off centre MC gets up from a nearby couch and goes to the front

Holly flicks through her notebook

ANGLE DOUGCHRISKATKA

DOUG

(to Chris)

Here comes her life story all twenty
something years of it

CHRIS
Lets hope it dont take that long to
read

HOLLY

As the dawn brings the sun and life to

her body made limp by sleep and the
pleasures of his passion she awakes and
feels her nakedness against the world and
his body lying still next to her Stained
bed sheet and a pillow heavy from sweat
are all that remains to validate his
valour in night time combat But she was
not his foe that unseen enemy he forced
his might against last night she was but a
cushion for his blows

ANGLE DOUGKATKACHRIS and FADE HOLLY SOUND TO BACKGROUND

HOLLY (OS)

No act of love but willing violence
demanded by one and begged by the other
As life turned to fantasy and reality to
ecstasy a need so deep no light could
reach surfaced like a nocturnal creature
unearthed for momentary and glorious
display Left alone in a rose-tinted
afterglow dimming fast she tasted the
moisture of her body and wondered why
light came to day and such desires to
her pale-skin body

DOUG
(to Chris)
Well she sure isnt normal

CHRIS
Fresh from the shrink Id say

DOUG
Yeah group bloody therapy time

KATKA
So why dont you get up and speak something
then we will see who is crazy

DOUG
Ooh well excuse me

ON HOLLY

HOLLY

And now as the window lace filters out

a darkened past she reaches for her body
once more Her hand glides from breast

to thigh as thoughts of times flow by

Her nipples awake and race after a conscious
thought of lustful moments in grassy fields
in time to see reality reap the earth and
leave it barren

ANGLE DOUGKATKACHRIS

Doug drinks Chris smokes and Katka listens PAN Audience
HOLLY (OS)

She has no reason for discontent and

less for hope of what love could be
in a privileged world Her eyes wander
once more and her hand follows down his
spine The nails that hide no blood run
down the valley of his buttocks stroking
electric hairs that lead to his well of
life and reason As the tendons in

her fingers tighten her Adonis wakes

and her eyes turn to the sky anda

life through netted curtains

Holly closes notebook and tentative applause begins as she moves back
to Josh who is clapping politely

JOSH
When the hell did you write that

HOLLY
Just yesterday

JOSH
Shit Honey you couldve told me
People might think its about us

HOLLY

excavation

that thing since we cant really replace
it and then put a walkway over it

CHRIS
So

DOUG

around that end of the pipe - so I can get
