CLOSE ON MAN’S FACE

Sully Breathing Haunted

SMASH CUT TO

EXT EAST RIVER BIKE PATH - DAWN 11

We are ON the BACK OF Sully’s head as he runs fast and
hard along the East River

Then AROUND TO Sully’s face his eyes dark with focus and
the shadow of the nightmare he is trying to shed

He wears an all-black sweatsuit and despite the harsh
cold sweat pours down his expressionless face

Not many out so early on a winter’s dawn Sully has the
pathway mostly to himself

And as he runs he cannot elude the relentless sounds
and images of his nightmare

Out of nowhere

SCREECH and HORN of a CAR as Sully just avoids getting
clipped by a passing car

Sully just keeps running west now back into the teeth
of the city Unable to get enough speed to elude his own
thoughts

SMASH CUT TO

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 5

INT HOTEL - ROOM - LATER

Silence Just the hum of a hotel room as Sully slowly
dresses in his white shirt (no epaulets) and black
pants

Every motion he makes is precise but a beat slow
And it is too quiet in here So he remotes on the TV

Every channel he checks is focused on the flight 1549
MIRACLE ON THE HUDSON

Shots of the PLANE IN THE WATER PASSENGERS on the wings
and in the emergency rafts

Ecstatic SURVIVORS hugging on the docks

Surviving passenger BARRY LEONARD 50 handsome and
amazed is shivering with cold and joy while being
interviewed by a TV reporter

BARRY (VO)
(Southern accent)
When I looked out the window and
saw he was going to land us in the
river I thought it’s over
What else could I think

Another channel Another interview

DIANE HIGGINS 58 lovely and stunned is in blissful
shock

DIANE HIGGINS (VO)
You think you’re going to die
that’s what you think And
then miraculously you don’t

Channel change Back to Barry

BARRY (VO)
(into camera)
I guess I could only say thank
you thank you for saving my
life

Sully watches the television and it feels like a show
more than the news Is this his life

DIANE HIGGINS (VO)
Thank you Captain
(choking up)
Thank you Thank

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 6

He smooths out the lines in his shirt looks in the
mirror But somehow can’t quite meet his own gaze

As we PUSH DEEP INTO Sully’s eyes we hear

CHARLES PORTER (VO)
(pre-lap)
you Yes thank you Captain
Sullenberger for joining us
today

INT HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sully and Skiles are sitting in a halogen-bright room
with two glasses of water in front of them

Next to them is MIKE CLEARY their union rep He’s 50s
black hair intense bearing

Across the table from them are the 3 NTSB members

ELIZABETH DAVIS late 40s gentle face BEN EDWARDS 50s
a banker’s demeanor and focus and CHARLES PORTER mid-
40s Marine-tough who is beginning the session

CHARLES PORTER
- and welcome also to First
Officer Skiles Glad you could
make it in this morning

SKILES
Not as glad as we are

Slight laughter

CHARLES PORTER
For the record we have an
Aircraft Systems Team on this
investigation also Aircraft

begin with our Operations and
Human Performance investigation
of the crash of US Air Flight

Water landing

CHARLES PORTER
Captain

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 7

SULLY
This was not a crash It was not
a ditching We knew what we were
executing A forced water
landing

BEN EDWARDS
Why didn’t you attempt to return
to LaGuardia

SULLY

There was simply not enough
altitude The river was the only
place long enough wide enough
and smooth enough to even attempt
to land the airplane safely

BEN EDWARDS
Air Traffic testified that you
stated you were returning to
LaGuardia But you didn’t

SULLY
As I began the left turn I
realized I couldn’t make it back
It would have ruled out all other
options Returning would have
been a mistake

CHARLES PORTER
Let’s get into how you calculated
all those parameters

SULLY
There wasn’t time for calculating
I had to rely on my experience of
managing the altitude and speed on
thousands of flights over four
decades

CHARLES PORTER
Youre saying you

SULLY
Eyeballed it

CHARLES PORTER
You eyeballed it

SULLY
The best chance those passengers
had was on that river Id bet my
life on it In fact I did And
I would do it again

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 8
13 BEN EDWARDS
Aviation engineers are theorizing
that you had enough energy to make
it back to a runway

SULLY
Engineers are not pilots They’re
wrong And they weren’t there

BEN EDWARDS
Regardless we have to follow up
all implications as part of our
investigation

CHARLES PORTER
Our computers will run return
scenario algorithms to generate
simulations with your exact
parameters The dual engine loss
the altitude Everything you
faced when you made your decision

SULLY
Id like to oversee those computer
simulations

BEN EDWARDS
Not possible during an
investigation

CHARLES PORTER
You stated it was a dual engine
failure due to multiple bird-
strikes

BEN EDWARDS
That would be unprecedented

SULLY
Everything is unprecedented
Until it happens the first time

The tension escalates
Mike Cleary shoots Sully a look to calm him down But --

Sully digs in as the questions continue to come in an
overlapping blur

BEN EDWARDS
How much sleep did you get the
night before

SULLY
8 hours Enough

In the backseat Sully looks exhausted

CHARLES PORTER
Is it possible your blood sugar
was low

SULLY
I was rested Completely aware of
my surroundings

Sullenberger

SULLY
A week ago

BEN EDWARDS

SULLY
No Never

CHARLES PORTER
First Officer Skiles

SKILES
Don’t drink Never have

CHARLES PORTER
Captain How about any troubles
at home

SULLY
No more than anyone else And
nothing that affected my work

-— NIGHT

It’s only 5 PM but night presses in through
the windows of the car driving Sully and Skiles and

the front seat fuming

SKILES
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong when it all turned
out right It’s bullshit

Skiles sits in

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 10

CLEARY
It didn’t turn out all right for
the airline and their insurance
company We should expect some
blowback

SKILES
Come on Mike What are they
going to say that he shouldn’t
have saved everybody

SULLY
It’s not personal the NTSB is
doing their job Once they have
all the facts it’1ll calm down

SKILES
They should just pin on the medal
and send you back to work

Sully doesn’t answer Instead he starts to dial his cell

SULLYS PHONE (V0O)
‘The voice mailbox of Lorrie
Sullenberger is full and cannot
receive further messages’

SULLY
I didn’t call her since this
morning But apparently everyone
else did

ANGLE ON THE DRIVER

A handsome Egyptian man in his early 50s He takes the
silence as a chance to speak

DRIVER
Not meaning to bother but I have
to say it is an honor driving you
today

SULLY
Thank you

DRIVER

What has it been this year so far
Bernie Madoff the two wars without
end many million new people with
no work And that is just the
first two weeks of January

(beat)
Friday’s headline This is
beautiful

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 11

Driver holds up the Jan 16th DAILY NEWS Its headline
reads “HERO ON THE HUDSON” With Sully’s photo inset

SKILES
Hey Mike How about we add the
driver as a character witness

The car stops as it awaits its chance to turn into the

hotel entrance Traffic keeps them at bay for the
moment

EXT ALEX HOTEL - SAME TIME

A pack of paparazzi is waiting

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sully sees the press and looks away Then he pulls out
his cell phone Trying Lorrie one more time It rings
and rings and rings

INTERCUT WITH

EXT SULLENBERGER BACKYARD (DANVILLE CA) - SAME TIME

LORRIE SULLENBERGER 50 fit pretty is in the backyard
She answers her cell

LORRIE
Finally

SULLY
The NTSB had us tied up all day

LORRIE
I just wanted to hear your voice
on the phone Been hearing
everyone else’s You’d be amazed
at how many ‘cousins’ you have

EXT HOTEL - SAME TIME

Driver finally makes the turn and stops outside the
hotel Cameras press up against the window strobing
Sully like a night at Studio 54

A BELLMAN opens the back door of the Town Car and the

rush of noise is deafening Sully has to yank it shut
again to hear Lorrie

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 12

SULLY
Doesn’t feel like family here

EXT SULLENBERGER HOUSE - SAME TIME

CRANE UP FROM the bg to reveal their little street is
clotted with worldwide media

Two dozen NEWS TRUCKS PARABOLIC MICS hordes of
PHOTOJOURNALISTS

The doorbell rings the home phone rings news trucks
honk as they crowd the tiny street

LORRIE
Pretty quiet here too

Sully’s door gets opened again Mayhem in the streets
Chants of “Sully Sully Sully”

LORRIE
The reporters want me to give an
update Inside the mind of Sully
What should I tell them

SULLY
Just tell them

LORRIE
I can’t hear you Call me back
without the cheerleaders

SULLY
I was saying to tell

LORRIE
I can’t hear you Call Me
Back

Lorrie hangs up

EXT HOTEL - SAME TIME

Sully gets out of the car with Skiles exiting the other
side And like Michael Jordan and the rest of the Bulls
the press try to swarm Sully and let Skiles slip through
almost imperceptibly

Skiles waves amiably to Sully happy to avoid the crush

And Sully is left behind encircled by COPS keeping the
tangle of cameras arms and microphones fifteen feet
back

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 13

The REPORTERS shout their questions
REPORTER 1
How does it feel to be a miracle

maker

REPORTER 2
Show us your cape Super Sully

REPORTER 3
How did you pull off the
impossible

TIME SLOWS Each FLASHBULB like a blow to a boxer’s
head

Sully winces blinks and finally closes his eyes His
anonymity is gone Forever And maybe more than that
INT HOTEL - BATHROOM - LATER

The shower burns The bathroom is so full of steam that
visibility is almost gone

The tub is running hot water and so is the sink

Sully has stuffed towels under the door to maximize the
steam effect

Finally amidst the murk we see Sully sitting on the
edge of the tub with a wet towel over his head

IN CLOSEUP

We see he is taking long deep breaths Trying to slow
down his heart which is still beating at double its

regular rate

It’s not working

INT HOTEL - BATHROOMBEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

The water is all stopped now though steam lingers

Sully wipes the mirror to see his reflection and it comes
back diffuse Unclear in all the heat And then the --
NOISE The unmistakable roar of a PLANE plummeting to
the ground Deafening He feels the sound crashing
towards him louder and louder And louder

As Sully hurries in to escape the sound he finds

SULLY - 11

SULLY
Of course Tired That’s it
(beat)
How are the girls

LORRIE
Theyre a little overwhelmed
(beat)
Sounds like you are too

SULLY
Theyll be all right It’s a lot

The sound of a photographer’s camera clinking against the
kitchen window as the photographer comes too close

LORRIE
Yes it is

Lorrie draws the kitchen curtains then remotes-on the
kitchen TV

PULL BACK to reveal Lorrie has muted it

LORRIE
The whole world’s talking about
you My Sully I still can’t
believe it

No answer

SULLY
They need me here longer For the
NTSB investigation Did I tell
you that already

LORRIE
Sully what is it

SULLY
Just tired I apologize if I
didn’t tell you

LORRIE
You don’t have to apologize
You’re where you need to be

SULLY
I just want you to know I did
the best I could

LORRIE

Of course you did You saved
everyone

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 16

Maybe we can talk tomorrow The
fatigue is it feels like

someone is inside my skin sitting
on my bones

LORRIE
Do you want me to come be with
you

SULLY
Thank you Lorrie But the
girls need you there

(beat)
Tell them I love them okay

LORRIE
I love you Get some sleep

SULLY
Yeah And maybe when I wake up
it will be January 14th That
would be nice

They hang up Both standing still 3000 miles of
distance between them And somehow even further apart

And while much of the country
hails him as a hero this new

called ‘Miracle on the Hudson’

disguise fraud From the banks of

Sully jerks AWAKE

He’s lying down in the hotel room But the TV has been
OFF the entire time In fact it’s UNPLUGGED

He rubs his face wishing he could get his hands inside
his skull to silence his brain

The clock reads 1241 AM

He picks up his phone several times Half dials Lorrie

Quits Finally picks up the hotel phone and dials an
extension Two rings until

INT JEFF SKILES’ HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

Skiles is sitting in a chair next to his made bed
drinking a soda eating a mini-bar Snickers He grabs
the ringing phone

SKILES
Hello

SULLY (V0)
Jeff Sorry to call this late

INTERCUT

SKILES
It’s okay No sleep in this room
either Can you believe they
charge five dollars for a
Snickers I could bankrupt the
airline in about four bites

SULLY
Just wanted to see if maybe you
wanted

SKILES

to talk Absolutely Let’s
grab some air

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 18

EXT 5TH AVENUE - MINUTES LATER

The wind-whipped streets are empty and the closed
storefronts and window displays make the street feel even
emptier

The night is mean with cold and Sully and Skiles walk
north on 5th Avenue bundled up Words don’t come easy

SKILES
You enjoying the shakes the
nightmares and the rabbit
heartbeat

SULLY
A little bit
(beat)
The union offered us counseling

SKILES
What are they going to say You
were in a plane crash And lived
It may have a minor impact on your

day-to-day

SULLY
I just hate not being able to
control this process I want
myself back

SKILES

I’m hoping that six months from
now we’ll just be laughing about
how we got to meet David
Letterman

SULLY
We’re doing ‘Letterman’

SKILES
Right after the NTSB interview
I’m guessing Dave will be funnier

SULLY
It’s all so surreal I guess I’m
just having a little trouble
separating reality from
whatever the hell this is

SKILES

This is two men freezing their
asses off

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 19

They laugh the steam from their mouths like unspoken
thoughts

SKILES
Sully don’t worry You dida
great thing and it’s going to be
remembered for a very long time

SULLY
Funny thing is I’ve delivered a
million passengers over 40 years
in the air and in the end Ill
be judged on 208 seconds

SKILES
Come on Tomorrow’s going to be a
good day Computer SIMS will
prove you were right and we can
all put our wings back on

KATIE COURIC and her camera crew

SULLY
it was obvious this was a
critical situation losing
thrust in both engines at a low
altitude over one of the most
densely populated areas on the
planet

KATIE COURIC
But choosing to land on the
Hudson there was still a big
if

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 20

SULLY
I was sure I could do it

KATIE COURIC
You were

SULLY
Yes

KATIE COURIC
How do you feel about people
calling you a hero

SULLY
I don’t feel like a hero I was
just a man doing his job

KATIE COURIC
The right man for the job at the
right time You’ve been flying
for nearly 40 years

SULLY
42 It has been my life My
whole life

Sully’s eyes spark bright for a moment as we --

ZOOM INTO them and COME BACK OUT THROUGH --

FLASHBACK - INT BI-PLANE - DAY (APRIL 3 1967)
Seeing all of Denison Texas stretched out below him

Sixteen-year-old Sully sits in the front of this tandem
two-seater prop plane

In the backseat is LT COOK 50s clean-shaven and
gruff but aware he’s witnessing the birth of a pilot

LT COOK
Your aircraft

In the roar of the tiny cockpit LT Cook circles the
stick to signal it’s Sully’s plane then takes his hands
off the override controls Sully circles his stick back
in response

SULLY
(amazed)
My aircraft

Sully flies He dips low over the verdant Texas
landscape Low enough for his parents --

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 21

CHESLEY and PAULINE Sullenberger to wave up at him
proudly

He soars back up against the perfect blue and he looks
absolutely in control And free Looks like he never
wants to come down

EXT LANDING STRIP - MINUTES LATER

Sully lands the plane on his own When the wheels touch
down it’s as if Sully’s memorizing the feel The
thrill He was up there Now he’s down here He did
it Him

He and LT disembark and stand on the grass strip as the

propeller does its final spin

LT COOK
I’1l be busy crop dusting in the
Super Cub the rest of the summer
So you can take the plane up I
guess When you please

Sully doesn’t say anything

LT COOK
Still six bucks an hour I’11
consider it lesson time A pilot
never stops acquiring knowledge
Youll make mistakes everyone
does Just learn from them

SULLY
Yes sir

LT COOK
And never forget no matter what’s
happening to fly the airplane

SULLY
Absolutely sir

LT COOK
One other thing And this is
important

SULLY
Yes sir

LT COOK

You can go ahead and smile

Sully’s face unleashes a deeply satisfied smile

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 22

INT BI-PLANE - ANOTHER DAY

Sully flies alone trying out new maneuvers Memorizing
everything on the panels constantly testing himself
improving He banks into the blue and when he returns
to level we are

INT BI-PLANE - ANOTHER DAY
And this time his Mother is on board PAULINE

Sullenberger is 41 and attractive She’s also relaxed
hands calmly on her lap as if out for a Sunday drive

SULLY
Your stomach’s not queasy Mom
MOTHER
No
SULLY
Not too noisy for you
MOTHER
No now let’s enjoy Just go low

and slow
She reaches over and squeezes his shoulder

MOTHER
You realize that if you’d studied
piano like this we’d be on our
way to Carnegie Hall now

SULLY
This is my piano Mom
(pause)
And I can still get us to Carnegie

Hall
They laugh and she squeezes his hand beyond proud

sweat despite the Texas heat

MATCH DISSOLVE TO

Sully’s face now 57 and moist with sweat

The Katie Couric interview is over Lights get switched
off camera packed up Katie’s long gone and --

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 23

ALISON cute mid-20s is removing the rest of Sully’s
foundation but he can’t stop sweating

SULLY
Sorry about the perspiration

ALISON
After what you did I’d think that
Katie couldn’t be too
intimidating

SULLY
Not Katie The lights and camera
she brought with her

ALISON
(beat)
All done

Alison gets on tiptoes and kisses Sully’s cheek
ALISON
That was from my mom Her name’s
Brenda She says to say thank
you and she’s single
They laugh
SULLY
Tell Brenda thanks but I’ve got a

girl at home

ALISON
Lucky woman

Alison exits and

Sully is alone Waiting in this strange hotel room
amidst the silence of not knowing what is going to happen
next he feels like the last man on Earth

He stares out onto the streets of Midtown 30 floors
below Reflected in the window we see the city before
him And then

A PLANE plummeting towards the Manhattan skyline

SULLY’S POV
As the jet descends relentlessly across the canyon of

buildings hidden by high-rises and then reappearing
like a ghost that won’t perish

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 24

Half the left wing severs free as it slams a building
then the plane vanishes again behind a wall of
skyscrapers

BOOM The plane detonates out of view fire and debris
licking out and around still visible the explosion
echoing through the streets

MAN (0S)
Sully Sully

CLOSE ON SULLY

still gazing out the window His eyes are vacant his
nightmare still shadowing him

But there is no reflection in the window

And outside there is no plane in ruins No fire Just
the city in motion

MAN (0S)
Sully

Finally Sully whiplashes back to find --
Mike Cleary his union rep standing by the door

CLEARY
Sully where are you

Sully looks out the window one last time Nothing

CLEARY
I’m standing here calling your
name what’s up with you

Sully keeps staring out Transfixed

CLEARY

You need to get focused because
the media request avalanche
continues Larry Rooney
volunteered to jump in and ride
shotgun with you the rest of the
way Thought you might need a
friend He’ll take you to today’s
NTSB meeting

(beat)
Sully Are you hearing me

Sully finally looks at Cleary

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 25

CLEARY
Airbus completed their computer
simulations as well

SULLY
Good Good That will help

CLEARY
There’s something else Arnie
Gentile called he got the ACARS
data
(beat)
The left engine was still
operating at idle

Sully feels like he’s been stabbed

SULLY
That’s not possible I felt it
go It was like being stopped in
mid-air

CLEARY
Arnie said there was a chance it
was sub-idle That it still
could’ve had thrust

Sully doesn’t answer
CLEARY

Just thought you should know
Since the NTSB already does

EXT HOTEL - LATER

WOLF PACK OF PAPARAZZI at the hotel door as --

Sully exits the hotel where the Katie Couric interview
just took place His eyes show an unfamiliar reticence
and he scans the crowd for a familiar face He finds one
in --

LARRY ROONEY 47 stocky friendly intense He wears a
US Air uniform snugly over a slight paunch

Larry waves from beside the car and Sully slowly makes
his way through the mayhem

Larry pulls him free of the final strangers into a
vehicle

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 26

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

SULLY
Larry Nice to finally see a
friendly face

The Town Car’s dark windows turn the media throng into a
horde of silhouettes

LARRY
Might be the last one you see
today

SMASH CUT TO

INT NTSB HEARING - LATER

The tension is high as Sully and Skiles sit across from
the investigators Rooney is by their side for support
And --

Skiles is riled up

SKILES
Isn’t it a little early in the
year to go fishing

CHARLES PORTER
Seeking the facts is hardly
fishing Mr Skiles

SKILES
Okay Then here is the most
important fact There are only
two people who know what happened
in the cockpit that day and I’m
one of them

CHARLES PORTER
And we appreciate your
perspective

SKILES
Why do you think we’re even here

SKILES
Look I just finished training on
the A320 and I can tell you that
the only reason the plane operated
as well as it did that the
aircraft could land anywhere is
because Captain Sullenberger
turned on the Auxiliary Power
Unit

ELIZABETH DAVIS
He was simply following the QRH

SKILES
No He wasn’t following the
proper procedure at all And I
know because I had the QRH in my
hands

leans forward Interested

SKILES
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine roll back According
to Airbus that’s the fifteenth
thing on the list to do
Fifteenth

SKILES
If he’d followed the damn rules
wed all be dead
(heating up)
Maybe that’s the part you don’t
like You’re not used to having
answers to your guesses

SULLY
(smoothing)

Look what Jeff is saying is that
I know the A320 What it does and
doesn’t do I’ve read countless
CVR transcripts of deceased pilots
and I have significant accident
investigation experience

CHARLES PORTER
There is no question that you are
an experienced dedicated
talented professional

BEN EDWARDS
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th and every
crash you investigated are not the
purview of this investigation
Only US Airways 1549 matters
today

akes a breath

ELIZABETH DAVIS
Your union has been advised
ACARS data relayed that the left
engine continued to turn
throughout the flight

SULLY
Then the data would be wrong

ELIZABETH DAVIS
The evidence shows the left engine
was at idle or sub-idle
immediately following the bird
strike

SULLY
(punched)
Show me the left engine and it’ll
be dead geese and no power

ELIZABETH DAVIS
The left engine was lost in the
crash due to the extensive damage
on touchdown but we’ll circle
back to that Let’s assume it
was aS you say a dual engine
loss due to bird strike

CHARLES PORTER
Your weight was 151510 lbs Wind
and temperature N-NW 21 degrees
Speed and altitude 200 knots at
2818 feet Agreed

SULLY
That’s correct

BEN EDWARDS

We were able to run all the
algorithms concurrently

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 29
35 CHARLES PORTER
And the resulting computer
simulations of US Airways Flight
1549 showed that the aviation
engineers were correct

BEN EDWARDS
There was enough altitude and
speed after the bird strike for a
successful return to LaGuardia

SULLY
(dubious)
Successful

CHARLES PORTER
The plane landed at LaGuardia
Intact Undamaged

SKILES
You got that from one computer
simulation

BEN EDWARDS
No From twenty

CHARLES PORTER
Including attempts for Teterboro
runway 19 and LaGuardia runways
22 and 13 Every computer
simulation with the exact flight
parameters demonstrated that a
return was possible And not just
possible Probable

The room goes ghost quiet
BEN EDWARDS
Does anyone need to hear further
computer evidence

LARRY ROONEY
Thank you

ELIZABETH DAVIS
And once the investigation is
complete we’ll be able to share
the actual computer simulations
For now they remain confidential
We can’t afford a leak to the
press

There’s been far too much talk in
the press already

CHARLES PORTER
When the complete Cockpit Voice
Recording is compiled with ATC
and all on-board transcripts
combined we will call you back

The NTSB exits So does Larry Rooney who follows them
out with hushed questions

Only Sully and Skiles remain Sully looks stunned

SKILES
Theyre playing Pac-Man you were
flying a plane full of human
beings

SULLY
Somehow Not the way I remember
it It just doesn’t seem right

the Captain said over the radio

PULL BACK FROM THE CLOSEUP to reveal that Sully and
Skiles are both in full uniform and are standing behind
flight attendants

The flight attendants all have the wonder of survival on
their faces And --

Skiles seems utterly at ease under the lights

Sully looks hemmed in The one person at the dance who
is hearing a different music

PULL BACK ALL THE WAY to reveal --

Sully has been watching his and the crews’ performance on

rings out

SULLY

Nervous as hell Jeff was relaxed
and funny He should be getting
all the interview requests

LORRIE

How long before we get you back
SULLY

I don’t know
LORRIE

The girls miss you I miss you

Lorrie peeks out the curtain All the media trucks

remain

LORRIE
Are they paying you to do all this
media stuff at least

SULLY
It’s news Lorrie No payment
necessary

LORRIE

Wish the bank felt the same way

Lorrie reaches their bedroom only her side of the bed

slept in

She takes an open envelope off the nightstand

It’s a bank statement

SULLY
What do you mean

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 33

LORRIE
It’s just we got another notice
about the space in Butte County
SULLY
Well find a tenant It takes
time
LORRIE

Youve been saying that for nine
months Sully and it’s still

vacant

SULLY
The economy has to take a
turn

LORRIE

If we lose that space it feels
like the next domino to fall is
the house

SULLY
We’re not going to lose the house
Lorrie what are you

LORRIE
I’m sorry Feeling a little
anxious and alone at the moment
Not a lot of sleep

SULLY
I know Not much sleep here
either

LORRIE
Just tell me youll be back in the
air soon

SULLY
Not before the NTSB finishes the
investigation

LORRIE

We need you flying

SULLY
Well they’re in no rush It’s
their job to scrutinize every
thought I had every syllable I
uttered every choice I made

LORRIE
Of course youll be back flying

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue)

A pause

SULLY
Lor If it goes badly my career
as a safety expert will end as a
website and a business card
LORRIE
I’m more worried about your career
as a pilot
Then
SULLY
What if I did blow it
LORRIE
Wait
SULLY

If I got this wrong so close to
the end of my career if I
endangered those passengers’
lives

LORRIE
Sully Watch the news You’re a
hero And everybodys going to
have to get used to it Including
the NTSB

SULLY
The NTSB doesn’t like heroes
They like to find and assign
responsibility

LORRIE
(worried)
What do you mean ‘responsibility’

SULLY
Worst case scenario the NTSB
lists me as the probable cause
immediate retirement No
pension a life’s work gone

LORRIE
I don’t understand what you’re
saying this could all fall on
us

SULLY
If it’s my fault it should

LORRIE
What fault You won They can’t
take that away from you

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 35

SULLY
Since I was 16 with LT the one
thing I’ve focused on was
excellence Attention to every
last detail And now they’re
etching my epitaph as ‘He crashed
a 60 million-dollar airplane in
the river’ Goddammit I feel
like I’m in a vice but I’m the
one who can’t stop tightening it

LORRIE
You’re scaring me Sully what’s
going on

Long silence

SULLY
The left engine it might have
still been idling And the Airbus
computer simulations they say I
could have made it back

Lorrie’s worry is an unspoken sound

SULLY
It doesn’t make any sense
Doesn’t jibe with what it felt
like in the cockpit but
dammit

LORRIE
Why did you do it Sully Land
in the water

Sully hears the ROAR OF APPLAUSE and laughter from the
“LETTERMAN” SHOW in direct contrast to how far away his
wife and his old life feel

LORRIE
Wasn’t that the most dangerous
thing you could have done

SULLY
I did it because I knew I
thought it was the only chance
for survival

Lorrie hears the uncharacteristic doubt in her husbands

voice

She looks

at the bank notice and other unopened bills

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 36 37
LORRIE
Now all we have to do is survive
surviving

Long silence

Two people breathing unable to find the words

LORRIE
Come home

SULLY
I can’t

LORRIE
Why not

SULLY

Ever have the feeling that you
don’t want to be anywhere at all

LORRIE
Thanks Sully

SULLY
It’s not you Lorrie I need you
And the girls I just I’m not
myself If I did fly back it
wouldn’t be me you’re getting

For a moment it seems Sully is out of rope

Captain

SULLY
Weve heard about the computer
simulations and now we’re watching
actual sims and I find it hard to
believe you’re still not taking
into account the human factor

CHARLES PORTER
Human-piloted simulations show
that you could have made it back
to the airport

SULLY
No They don’t

Finally

His “no” is clear and strong and galvanizes the room’s

full attention

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 91

SULLY
These pilots are not reacting like
human beings Like people who are
experiencing this for the first
time

CHARLES PORTER
They may not be reacting like you
did but

SULLY
Immediately after the bird strike
they’re turning for the airport
Just as in the computer sims
correct

CHARLES PORTER
That is correct

SULLY

They obviously knew the turn and
exactly what heading to fly They
didn’t run a check or switch on
the APU

CHARLES PORTER
They had the same parameters you
faced

SULLY
No one warned us No one said
you’re about to lose both
engines at a lower altitude
than any jet in history But be
cool Turn back for LaGuardia
like you’re going out to pick up
the goddamn milk

His outrage pins the room to the wall

SULLY
This was dual engine loss at 2800
feet followed by an immediate
water landing With 155 souls on
board No one has ever even
trained for an incident like that
No one

SKILES
Sully’s right It’s absurd to
expect an immediate turn for the
airport

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 92

SULLY
And the Teterboro landing with
the unrealistic bank angle this

wasn’t the Blue Angels up there
Id like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver
before he actually pulled it off

Long pause No answer from the NTSB forthcoming

SULLY
I’m not questioning the pilots
They’re good pilots But they’ve
clearly been instructed to head to
the airports immediately after the
bird strike You have allowed no
time for analysis and decision
making And with these sims you
have taken all the humanity out of
the cockpit How much time did
these pilots spend making their
plans for this event Hours
days

Finally the nose begins to bob up and as the water

clears Sully and Skiles have a sudden and perfect view

of the --

MANHATTAN SKYLINE Dream-like As if they’re inside a

snow globe all of NY opening before them at river

level

Sully and Skiles look at each other Alive

INT NTSB HEARING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) 163
Silence No more words Who could have survived that

The recording is over The room hums with the quiet of
shock

For the first time Porter and the other board members
seem to really look at Sully and Skiles To take them
in To realize that they survived this impossibility
This was a miracle on the Hudson

Sully and Skiles betray almost no emotion still shaken

SULLY
(rising)
I need a quick break

Sully exits alone and as he waits for Skiles his phone
rings Lorrie

SULLY
Lorrie
INTERCUT WITH
INT SULLENBERGER BEDROOM - SAME TIME 167

Lorrie is lying on their bed Next to her is a large
opened FEDEX PACKAGE which held

SULLY’S SUITCASE rescued from the wreckage of Flight
1549 Including his --

Pilot’s hat Which Lorrie is cradling in her hands
Tears steal the rest of her speech

SULLY
Sweetheart what happened

LORRIE
For the first time just now I
realized that there were 155
people on that plane And you
were one of them

More tears Tears of relief and joy
LORRIE
I almost lost you The girls

almost lost you

SULLY
But you didn’t I’m here

Long pause as they simply take in the sound of each
other’s breathing Their existence It is beautiful

LORRIE
How are you holding up Tell me
it’s almost over

SULLY
It’s almost over

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 107

167

LORRIE
I love you

SULLY
I love you

Sully hangs up Takes a moment to gather himself

Skiles exits the bathroom and joins Sully as they walk in
silence back toward the conference room

Just before they reach the doors Sully stops
Skiles stops too Faces Sully

SULLY
What did you think Listening to
the CVR Now

Skiles can’t muster an answer

SULLY

I’1l tell you what I think I’m
just so damn proud of you You
were right there with me through
all those distractions With so
much at stake

(pause)
We did this together We were a
team

Skiles’ eyes brim with tears

SKILES
Thank you

Then they lock into an embrace Brothers For life
When they step back the emotion is an invisible cord
between them

SULLY
We did our job

SKILES
We did our job
INT NTSB HEARING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

All have returned The weight of the investigation has
been replaced by a sense of humble awe

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 108

CHARLES PORTER
That is honestly the first time
I have listened to a crash
recording while actually
sitting with the Captain and First
Officer Extraordinary

SKILES
That was no simulation

CHARLES PORTER
No it wasn’t

The NTSB board is looking for the right words
Finally

ELIZABETH DAVIS
I also wanted to let you know that
the left engine was recovered late
yesterday

Sully waits a beat

The monitors they have been watching come to life with
VIDEO FOOTAGE

A massive crane lifts the LEFT ENGINE from the Hudson
River It dangles over the water facing away Its
damage unseen

On the video the LEFT ENGINE rotates TOWARD CAMERA It
is mangled and decimated from within and without

ELIZABETH DAVIS
Extensive damage on both the guide
vanes and fan blades of the
engine Five compressor blades
were fractured and eight variable
guide vanes missing

SULLY
No thrust

ELIZABETH DAVIS
As you testified it was
completely destroyed The ACARS
data was wrong

Sully and Skiles are transfixed by the video of the
engine that almost got them killed

ELIZABETH DAVIS
Id like to add something on a
personal note

ELIZABETH DAVIS (CONTD)
I can say with confidence that
after speaking with the rest of
the flight crew with bird experts
and airplane engineers after
running all the scenarios and
talking to each of the players
there is an X in this result
It’s you Captain Sullenberger
Take you out of the equation and
the math just fails

SULLY
I disagree

The room hushes Waiting for Sully to finally unleash
Instead

SULLY
It wasn’t just me It was all of
us Jeff Donna Sheila Doreen
The passengers the rescue
workers Air traffic control
The ferry boat crews and the scuba
cops We did it We survived

ELIZABETH DAVIS
First Officer Skiles is there
anything you’d like to add
Anything you would have done
differently if you had to do it
all again

SKILES
Yes
(beat)
I would have done it in July

Laughter surprises the room Finally a little space to

breathe
FADE TO WHITE
FADE IN

LATER (REAL-LIFE FOOTAGE)

The wreckage of US AIR Flight 1549 on full display
The damage to the fuselage the missing left engine It
doesn’t look like the kind of plane you walk away from
alive

The lobby is filling up with visitors but not just any
tourists Flight 1549 passengers one and all

SULLY - 111815 (Full Blue) 110

The real-life SURVIVORS

They were strangers when they boarded the flight Now
they are family forever

Jeff Skiles enters An eruption of APPLAUSE as Sully
enters and signals for

Jeff and Donna and Sheila and Doreen to join him He
pulls them in line with him so that the crew of 1549 are
receiving the cheers As one
