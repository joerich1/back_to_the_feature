EXT THE FOX THEATER PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

It’s winter A line of people wraps around the red brick
walls of the theater thick clouds of breath (like horses’ )
in the freezing air

SCREEN TITLE JANUARY 10 1952
SCREEN TITLE NEW JERSEY

BURTS VOICE (0S)
Mommy and Daddy will be right next
to you The lights will go down
There may be some organ music as
the curtain opens --

The camera goes down the line till near the rear it reaches
SAMMY FABELMAN 6 years old His eyes are wide his mouth is
drawn downwards he looks very scared on the verge of tears
A man’s voice says

BURT’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Don’t be scared

SAMMY
Itll be dark in there You said

BURT FABELMAN 37 an engineer bespectacled sport jacket
and tie looks down at Sammy

SAMMY (CONT’D)
I don’t wanna go in

BURT
But it’s fun All week you’ve been
so excited - your first-ever movie

SAMMY
And the people are gigantic

BURT
What people

SAMMY
You said the people in the movie
are gigantic

BURT
No because of the big screen
they’re on But they’re not real
(to Mitzi)
Right
Conformed Draft 2

Sammy looks up at his mom

MITZI’S VOICE (0S)
Theyre like dreams

SAMMY
Dreams are scary

His mother’s gloved hand gently caresses his cheek

MITZI
Some dreams are but this is gonna
be a nice dream about a circus
and clowns and acrobats and um —

BURT
You wanna know how it works
There’s a big machine called a
projector inside there’s a big
bright light and it projects
photographs of of clowns and

acrobats -
MITZI BURT (CONTD) (CONT’D)
And elephants and um Projecting means it sends
happy things them out - Happy things -
like light from a huge
flashlight

BURT (CONTD) (CONT’D)
These photographs move past the
light really fast - 24 photos in
every second - Now in your brain
each photograph stays for about a
fifteenth of a second

Sammy listens but he still looks scared

BURT (CONT’D)
That’s called persistence of
vision The photographs move past
faster than your brain can let go
of them And that’s how the movie
projector tricks us into believing
that motionless pictures are moving
- a motion picture

Sammy baffled is gently turned by the gloved hand to face -
MITZI FABELMAN 33 short blonde hair her own inventive

quirky sense of style She crouches down to his level and
turns the full force of her charm on him
Conformed Draft 3

MITZI
Movies are dreams dolly that you
never forget You just wait and
see when it’s over you’re gonna
have the biggest sloppiest smile on
your face

Sammy’s anxiety starts to give way Burt’s moved by this
Mitzi’s way with Sammy Sammy’s complete trust in her The
line starts moving

BURT
They’re letting us in

Mitzi looks up at Burt he winks at her Mitzi looks at
Sammy raising an eyebrow “Are we going in” Sammy nods
giving her his permission Mitzi stands holding Sammy’s
hand As the line moves and the Fabelmans approach the
entrance the camera lifts up to the marquee - Cecil B
DeMille’s The Greatest Show On Earth

film running through gears passing through the gate image

into

But it’s too late The train hits the car and flips it over

IN THE THEATER

Sammy’s whole body goes rigid pushing back into his seat
staring in shock at the catastrophe on the screen

Cut between the crash as the moving train ploughs into the
stalled train and Sammy’s reactions frozen stills of his
sheer visceral terror (cf 2001s star gate sequence) For
Sammy this is real not a movie His eyes are huge taking in
danger on the screen lions and tigers are escaping from the
demolished train

Above and behind him the projector’s beam’s colors cross
dance in the thick cigarette-smoke-filled air The beam’s
colors blend and merge into

INTEXT - THE FABELMAN CAR DRIVING THROUGH HADDON HEIGHTS

the colors of Christmas lights festooning every house on
the street Sammy’s in the car’s front seat between his
parents visibly stricken with fear

Christmas lights He squints

BURT
The lights change how everything

Mitzi laughs

SAMMY (CONTD)

MITZI
Sorry Dolly Jews don’t get

As the car pulls into the driveway of the neighborhood’s only
dark house

“Who could ask for anything more”

Burt leans over Sammy and gives Mitzi a big romantic kiss
Sammy watches delighted and horrified Then

SAMMY
Can I sleep with the oscilloscope

CUT TO 4

CU on Burt’s oscilloscope its sign wave waving filling
Sammy’s darkened bedroom with an eerie a pulsating green glow
that’s having a narcotizing effect on Sammy in bed fighting
but succumbing to sleep His eyes flutter and close

CUT BACK TO 5

CU on the oscilloscope’s round screen Superimposed over its 6
fluctuating green sign wave A wild jumble of sounds from The
Greatest Show On Earth The tempo of the oscilloscope’s wave
fluctuations increase getting frantic at the sound of the

car being driven onto the train tracks the driver shouting
frantically Suddenly flashing to the image as the train
flips the car and collides with the other train

INT FABELMAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

A big piano fanfare with Mitzi at the keys as the family

she’ll stitch together someday to make an afghan Burt films
with a wind-up Kodak Brownie 8mm camera bright lights on a
stand overexpose the room all around which are TV sets

Conformed Draft 9

INT THE FABELMAN GARAGE - NIGHT

The garage is Burt’s work-station TV sets undergoing
repairs on a workbench tools and ham radio equipment

Burt hunkers down next to Sammy and places the locomotive in
front of the other cars on the completed tracks mounted on a
green-painted plywood board

BURT
so the outside grounds the
middle conducts the power and
these two metal wheels under the
engine complete the circuit

The two grandmothers and Mitzi enter as Burt carefully
connects the engine to the train

HADASSAH
(to Burt )
So nu Mr Engineer RCA gave you a
raise That is one expensive
trolley car

SAMMY BURT
(indignant ) No raises for the computer
It’s not a trolley car it’s a guys this year Next year
Lionel train maybe
MITZI

Your moonlighting son is paying for
it by filling up my house with
broken TVs Repair work That’s
how

Sammy moves to the transformer sending Hadassah lunging for
Burt

HADASSAH
Oy Careful he doesn’t electrocute
himself

Sammy looks at Burt momentary alarmed Tina gets down on the
floor with Sammy as Burt says to Hadassah

BURT TINA
Ne pugay mal’chika (Don’t Hold on you’re not taking
scare the boy) that fancy train to Florida
(to Sammy) without me
Youre okay
HADASSAH

She’s down on the floor Who’s
gonna help her up

Conformed Draft 10

TINA
Who says I’m getting up I’m going
to Miami on the Sammy Limited
(to Sammy )
Go ‘head

Reassured Sammy turns the transformer knob The train moves
Everyone claps oohs and aahs Reggie and Natalie rush in
thrilled by the spectacle

Sammy kneels to bring himself eye level to the tracks From
his new perspective the approaching train looks life-size
getting bigger as it races towards him In his mind the
clickety-clack of a toy train is replaced by the deafening
roar of a steam locomotive When the train reaches him Sammy
flinches breaking the illusion - which fascinates him

EXT THE FABELMAN HOUSE - NIGHT 10

Surrounded by houses ablaze with Christmas lights the
Fabelman house is the black hole of Crystal Terrace Avenue

INT THE GARAGE - NIGHT 12

Sammy’s hand places a toy convertible car on the tracks
facing the train He wedges a small wooden figure of Noah in
the driver’s seat

Flashlight in hand Sammy’s turns the transformer dial

The train starts to move towards the car which Sammy’s hand
is moving towards the train then we see Sammy’s face level
with the plywood trying to get the correct perspective

The locomotive picks up speed CU of smokestack pumping
smoke The toy car barrels toward the train CU of Noahs
face caught in the train’s headlight

Sammy holds his breath watching the train and car heading at
one another the sound is again in Sammy’s head VERY LOUD
AND REAL Then

CRASH The car hits the train In SLOW MOTION it does
exactly what it’s supposed to do It flips up and over the
train just like in the movie Noah flies out of the car
Sammy in the background traces with his eyes Noah’s arc
through the air and then

At normal speed Sammy snaps his gaze to the train rushing
straight at Noah’s model Ark placed on the tracks tilted to
make sure it’1l be derailed when

Conformed Draft 11

CRASH AGAIN In SLOW MOTION the train slams into the ark
The cars accordion into V-shaped towers as the ark topples
heavily onto its side its roof popping off and its animals
dozens of pairs tumble and scatter across the floor

Sammy startled pulls away from the tracks jarring Burt’s
work table causing a shelf of tools near the edge of the
table to fall to the cement floor making a mighty racket

INT BURT AND MITZI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The sound of the falling tools startle Burt and Mitzi out of
deep sleep They sit up in bed

INT SAMMYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sammy is in bed Mitzi tucking him in He’s watching Burt
who sits on the edge of the bed carefully straightening a
bent coupler on one of the train’s cars with a needle-nose
pliers

BURT
They’re precisely engineered toys
You can play with them when you’ve
learned to treat them with respect

SAMMY
I do respect them I love them

BURT
I know you do but you can’t just
love something you also have to
take care of it right

He rises but pauses in the doorway
BURT (CONTD)
Maybe we can play together with
them this weekend
He leaves with the mended train car
SAMMY
(turning to his mom )

But I need to see them crash

Mitzi looks at him understanding something

Conformed Draft 12

140A INT AND BURT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 140A

Mitzi and Burt are back in bed Burt is still working on the
train’s coupling Mitzi is reading and marking the piano
score for the Goldberg Variations

BURT
I don’t understand Why does he
need to see them crash

He looks at Mitzi She shrugs studying her score Burt goes
back to the train then he shows Mitzi The two train cars
couple She cheers quietly Burt puts the cars on the
nightstand He’s about to take off his glasses and settle
down to sleep when he stops because she’s still reading her
score

BURT (CONT’D)
It’s late You don’t wanna shut
your light

MITZI
In a minute I’m still wide awake
(showing him the score
open to Variation 21)
See these descending notes
That’s called a lament bass
(singing the opening
notes tapping each with
her blue pencil )
Ya da da dee dah dah dah dah

BURT
You should play it on the radio On
that arts program they keep asking
you to come back

MITZI
I don’t have the time for that

BURT
We can hire a sitter

MITZI
Who can afford that Forget it
That was another life that was two
kids ago

Burt switches off his light She looks up from the score

MITZI (CONT’D)
Know what I miss most about the
piano Surrendering to the score
knowing Bach is gonna tell you how

Conformed Draft 13

First this note then this chord
then you open your hand you
stretch down an octave and
(she sings the notes of
the lament bass playing
them with her fingers)
Making a little world you can be
safe and happy in

Burt kisses Mitzi’s hand and lies back She takes off his
glasses and he smiles with his eyes closed

BURT
Thank you

Mitzi places them on the nightstand next to the train cars
Mitzi stares at the glasses and the trains

MITZI
That’s why he needs to watch them
crash He’s trying to get some kind
ofcontrol over it

Mitzi’s eyes stay on the train cars An idea is forming

INT THE GARAGE OF THE FABELMAN HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Reflected in the broken TV screens Sammy sets up his shot
placing the train the toy car driven by Noah and the tilted
ark on the tracks Mitzi enters with Burt’s movie camera
She smiles at him his complete absorption in the task

MITZI
Sammy We’re going to use Daddy’s
camera to film it Only crash the
train once OK Then after we get
the film developed you can watch
it crash over and over till it’s
not so scary anymore And your real
train won’t ever get broken

Sammy rises eagerly to take the camera but Mitzi holds onto
it as she kneels before him

MITZI (CONTD)
One other thing Dolly Let’s not
tell your father It’1ll be our
secret movie just yours and mine
(with a wink )
Okay

SAMMY
Okay

Burt bursts through the front door carrying a TV set As he
heads to the kitchen

BURT
Sorry I’m late I picked up Mrs
Moynahan’s Motorola There’s no
room left in the workshop Where
should I put it

MITZI
The living room I guess

Burt staggers away with the TV set Right behind him
Hadassah struggling to get free clutching her huge knitting
bag is being carried in by BENNIE LOEWY 35 Burt’s work
associate and friend working-class balding heavyset
cherubic face sweet smile mischievous twinkle

BENNIE

HADASSAH

(Put me down you big
goatish lump you should
be ashamed )

Hadassah grabs Bennie’s ear and twists HARD forcing him to
put her down

BENNIE
OWWWW OW OW OW

Sammy rushes through the door past the pair and straight to
the kitchen where Mitzi’s got a huge meal going pots on the
stove a brisket and a casserole in the oven She’s turning
the crank of a large metal grinder making chopped chicken
liver

SAMMY
Did the mail come

MITZI
(to Sammy )
It’s on the table

Conformed Draft 15

Sammy runs to the dining table and rifles through the mail
Hadassah finally extricates herself from Bennie

HADASSAH
Cossack

She enters the kitchen with a bag of knitting supplies After
a brief silent stare down with Mitzi she crosses to open
the oven

HADASSAH (CONT’D)
This is brisket

In the dining room Sammy happily snatches a box of processed
Kodak film from Bennie

SAMMY

MITZI
Ah ah ah After supper

She plucks the film from his hands and puts the film box in
her apron pocket

CUT TO 18

Burt Bennie Mitzi Reggie Sammy Natalie and Hadassah
still visiting are eating Mitzi’s superabundant shabbos
meal The plates the tablecloth the napkins are paper the
flatware and cups are plastic Bennie is seated between
Natalie and Burt Two candles are burning and there’s a
challah

BURT
The amount of magnetism is
increased by how magnetically
permeable the core material is The
tricky thing is how permeable -

BENNIE MITZI
Right though eddy currents Am I supposed to be following
can cause energy loss it’s - any of this
BURT

(to Mitzi)
You know what a magnetic field is
right

MITZI
Well sure I mean - Sammy do you
know what a magnetic field is
Conformed Draft 16

SAMMY
Can I be excused

BURT
Nope

SAMMY
But I need to just for a minute

BURT
What’s so urgent

HADASSAH
(to Burt )
Honey This tastes funny Burt It
tastes funny on a plastic fork

BURT
Mom

HADASSAH
Is she saving the silverware for
when the Eisenhowers drop by

BURT

(to Mitzi)

The problem is we’re using vacuum
tubes not transistors and
magnetic cores to access -

BENNIE

35000 magnetic cores

(to Sammy )

Hey Sam you know how on your
father’s camera when the film runs
out

Sammy is instantly interested

BENNIE (CONT’D)
When that happens what do you do

SAMMY
(With authority even a
little condescension
because it’s so obvious)
Load more film

BENNIE
The same with computers you have
to load more tape and that slows
everything down
Conformed Draft 17

BENNIE (CONTD) BURT
But we’ve figured out how to Mitts the chopped liver was
take a whole bunch of tapes beyond belief
loaded with data -

Mitzi shushes Burt with a gesture focused on Bennie

BENNIE (CONT’D)
- and instead of changing tapes
every ten seconds this new machine
he’s engineering -

He points to Reggie who eagerly leaps up for her cue

REGGIE
The BIZMAC

BENNIE
The Bizmac It can search for
information through all these tapes
at once You never need to change
any of ‘em It’ll be ten times
faster

Mitzi takes Burt’s hand and says to Bennie

MITZI
I love Burt’s brain especially
when you’re around to explain
what’s in it

Hadassah looks up from her plate fixing Mitzi then Bennie
with a look

SAMMY
Mom I have to go upstairs now

BURT
Not until you’ve finish eating

MITZI
He cleaned his plate

NATALIE
No he didn’t

Natalie picks up Sammy’s plate revealing that he’s hidden
almost all his food in a semi-circle under the rim

BURT
Sammy

Burt’s about to scold Sammy who’s staring daggers at
Natalie when Bennie jumps in
Conformed Draft 18

BENNIE
Hey Natalie I think there’s
something under your plate

NATALIE
No there isn’t

Mitzi quietly crooks a finger to summon her son

MITZI
Sammy

BENNIE
(to Natalie)
Lift it up and check I saw it
moving

Natalie lifts her plate There’s a big black spider
underneath She screams

Bennie snatches the spider and pops it in his mouth and
chews Natalie screams again and Reggie joins her

While the girls scream at Bennie’s anties Mitzi takes the
film from her apron pocket and slips it to Sammy who runs
out

Bennie chews grinning mouth full he says a la Spencer
Tracy in Adam’s Rib

BENNIE (CONT’D)
Licorice If there’s anything Ima
sucker for it’s licorice

Everyone bursts out laughing

NATALIE
Uncle Bennie that was soooco
disgusting So gross

HADASSAH
Natalie He is not your uncle
(to Mitzi pointedly )
Also he is not that funny

MITZI
(as she tries to get
control of her laughing )
Uncle is a term of affection

Hadassah grunts then resumes eating Mitzi still giggling
starts clearing the food leaving the paper- and plastic-ware
on the table
Conformed Draft 19

HADASSAH
Natalie he’s not related He’s
only always here because he works
for my son

BURT
He’s only always here because he’s
my best friend

BENNIE
And deep down inside you Mrs
Fabelman admit it I’m your friend
too

HADASSAH
Deep down inside of me is none of
your business

Hadassah goes back to eating

MITZI
Sid Caesar’s on at 8
(to Reggie and Natalie)
Help me

Hadassah knows what’s coming she lifts up her plate and
keeps eating Meanwhile the girls jump up and grab two ends
of the paper tablecloth while Mitzi grabs an end then
gestures to Bennie to do likewise He does

BURT

BENNIE

Moments later ensconced in darkness Sammy seated on the

On the closet wall ahead of them an 8”X10” rectangle of
light appears and Sammy’s train crash movie starts to play

First the train rounding the bend and passing the camera
Then there’s a flash of light Then we see the Ark on the
tracks with the car in front of it Sammy’s fingers make

Noah climb into the car

Another flash The train is coming right at the lens its
light getting brighter and brighter Then another flash

Mitzi is unable to take her eyes off the film The car
driven by Noah is coming right at the lens of the camera

Another flash of light then a side angle as the train
smashes into the car The car flips up and Noah goes flying
Another flash then the camera itself is speeding towards the
ark Another flash and the train is heading straight at the
lens It collides into the camera Mitzi gasps Sammy takes
her arm and watches her closely seeking her approval

Another flash of light then Mitzi spellbound watches the
train crash into the ark the trains accordion and uncouple
another flash and the ark falls over and the animals inside
fly out towards the camera Mitzi gasps again

A giggling Reggie lies on the floor wrapped in strips of
torn-up bedsheet from the neck down Sammy wraps her face and
hands in toilet paper which Natalie feeds to him from an
immense pile of unspooled toilet paper

Sammy soaks Reggie’s tissue-wrapped face and hands with a
squirt gun producing the effect of hideously wrinkled flesh

that to Sammy’ s evident satisfaction resembles Boris
Karloff’s in The Mummy

Reggie opens her eyes raises her arms stiff and
perpendicular and growls teeth bared

REGGIE (CONTD)
Bennie don’t look

He deftly removes her hand and kisses it Reggie flings him
off and storms away

REGGIE (CONTD)
Oh You’re all nuts

Mitzi swoops pirouettes leaps Burt watches her with love
and hunger overcast with sorrow Bennie with longing Reggie
watches from her tent feeling sadness and empathy for her

Mitzi gracefully lowers herself to the ground ending the
performance with a soft smile

A few weeks later Burt sits quietly focused on a beeping
scope Not an oscilloscope this time but a heart monitor He
looks scared

In a nearby hospital bed Sammy’s maternal grandmother Tina
skeleton-thin her hair transparent is dying

Mitzi lies on the bed next to her mother holding Tina’s

She turns to the NURSE at the back of the room excited

The nurse moves to the bed passing the girls all on the
brink of tears She quietly takes Tina’s pulse then turns to
Burt But he already knows The monitor has flatlined

Frightened Sammy looks at his father Burt is still staring
at the heart monitor He seems helpless and afraid

Mitzi realizes Tina is gone She starts sobbing Burt goes to
her He puts his hands on her shoulders but she reaches back
to brush him off

sofa papers all about him scribbling work-related notes as
he listens to her play

CUT BACK TO 73

The editing machine’s loaded Sammy turns the handle feeding
footage through the viewer Mitzi eats some stew from the
campfire She turns to Sammy’s camera and opens her mouth
wide exhibiting the masticated contents Then she feigns
theatrically choking and dying Reggie steps in to haul her
to her feet laughing

Sammy transfers the film to the editing block and cuts out
the shot to add to the series of trims taped to his table

Everyone walks up a steep path smiling waving at the
camera Sammy at the editing machine scowls and cranks
faster racing through till he gets to

Mitzi rides up and down on the sapling while Burt teaches the
girls tripod-building Sammy at the editor slows down at a
possible jump from the tree lifting Mitzi to a close-up of
her face laughing lit-up a little scared He enjoys
speeding it up reversing it

Sammy searches through a new reel now enjoying the work He
cranks ahead till he gets to

Burt gutting a fish Lisa Natalie and Reggie looking grossed
out Reggie pretends to eat the fish guts grossing out
Natalie Sammy chuckles then he cranks ahead stops and
reverses - his eye’s been snagged by something Cranking the
film forward again slowly Sammy bends closer to the ground-
glass screen At a distance from Burt and the girls in the
frames’ background Mitzi and Bennie are seated on a log
together deep in conversation Bennie playfully puts his hat
on Mitzi’s head

Sammy stares at this frame then he slowly turns the crank
wanting to move past this but also reluctant to do so
Deciding to leave it he zooms through a few more scenes

Everyone’s walking across a stone bridge pretending to be
tightrope walkers Mitzi and Bennie last in line Bennie
puts both his hands on Mitzi’s shoulders and starts to draw
her close to him Sammy slows the film down as Mitzi allows
Bennie to hold her before she spins and pulls Bennie’s big
hat down over his eyes The reel ends and Sammy yawning
changes it out

listens as he works making calculations with one hand
conducting with the other

CUT BACK TO 77

Sammy scrolls rapidly through a new roll stopping at a
sequence of Reggie and Natalie clowning around with some
branches In the background Bennie and Mitzi walk along a
trail into the woods

Something catches Sammy eye and he reverses the film to play
it again slowly intent on -

Mitzi and Bennie in the woods partly obscured by tree
branches but what’s not hidden is Bennie putting his hand
tenderly on the small of Mitzi’s back Mitzi moves his hand
away but as she does she looks back over her shoulder to
make sure no one’s watching Then she leans over and kisses
Bennie’s ear He playfully flicks at his ear as if brushing
off a mosquito They laugh and walk together into the
darkness of the woods Mitzi leaning her body against
Bennie’s as they disappear from view

Sammy throws the reel off the editor and reloads the earlier
one of the stone bridge crossing The intimacy between Mitzi
and Bennie is even more clear as she gazes lovingly into his
eyes when he steadies her balance

CUT TO

In the living room Burt continues “conducting” with his
pencil

CUT TO

Sammy has loaded a new reel Mitzi Burt and Bennie clowning
around at the campsite Burt and Bennie laugh as Mitzi
gesticulates dramatically doing silent movie Lillian-Gish-
type schtick She puts her hand to her forehead in a 19th
Century stage swoon Both Burt and Bennie move to catch her
Mitzi switches direction mid-swoon to make sure that when
she’s caught it’s by Bennie not Burt Bennie dips her as if
about to go in for a passionate kiss He scrolls slowly ahead
to a frame of Bennie’s and Mitzi’s faces almost about to
kiss The next frame an instant so quick it barely
registered but there it is on frame Mitzi has abandoned her
stage-pucker and is looking up into Bennie’s eyes
meaningfully sad serious

Sammy shoves back from the movie editor and stands
overwhelmed terrified he’s having a panic attack

On screen Mitzi’s dance edited by Sammy dramatic and
beautiful Joy sorrow desire move across Mitzi’s face as
she vanishes into the darkness beyond the headlights then
with her instinct for drama Mitzi runs to the campfire

EXT AN ABANDONED ADOBE PUEBLO THE DESERT OUTSIDE PHOENIX
DAY

A teen in a t-shirt and a makeshift Nazi helmet stands on a
boulder bringing his assault weapon to bear

“NAZI” SOLDIER
DIE AMERIKANER

As his comrades charge over the rocks he jiggles his gun
from fake “recoil” and makes machine gun sounds with his
mouth

Other howling BOYS charge at the camera in uniform tan
chinos black t-shirts black infantry caps each with a
cardboard badge of a Swastika-clutching German eagle The kid
playing their commander wears a genuine WWII German helmet
They’re armed with toy rifles and BB guns a few have real
lugers which they wave as they hurl themselves forward
laying siege to an American stronghold inside the pueblo

They sweep past Sammy who pans with them to catch all of the
action on his camera

Sammy digs two shallow holes in the dirt then sets a board
on a rock as a pivot point to seesaw between the divots He
covers one end with dirt so that when he steps on the other
side of the board it launches a cloud of dirt into the air
Instant “explosion” The costumed actors are thrilled by the
effect
Conformed Draft 70

In a series of fast VIOLENT cuts Hand-to-hand combat
American soldiers in white t-shirts and green infantry caps
bayoneting Germans Germans shooting Americans The boys have
sponges filled with red tempera paint when they get shot
they press the sponges and squeeze the blood oozes out
Sammy crouching moves in and around the fighting soldiers
filming He uses an old baby carriage as a makeshift dolly
to sweep across a line of charging soldiers He comes in
close as one soldier shot in the face mashes his hands
against his eyes and screams as blood gushes between his
fingers

Roger carefully lays a string of firecrackers in a shallow
trench then covers it with dirt Later as soldiers race
through the area the firecracker puffs mimic machine gun

fire tearing through their ranks They all fall

Then ANGELO a tall handsome tough-looking 16 year old
playing an American sergeant enters with a surplus army
machine gun He fires at the Germans Dozens of
firecrackers concealed in the wall against which the Germans
have been forced detonate Despite the visible evidence of
burning fuses this sells the impression of bullets
destroying the wall and the soldiers Germans collapse like
bloody dusty rag dolls

Angelo turns so the camera can catch his face looking
heroic

Sammy hands Sal the camera and pulls Angelo aside to issue

Angelo steps from behind a ruined wall a mass of dead
soldiers behind him He looks down at the valley in front of
him

Angelo has an instinctive understanding of how to do this
acting thing His face is hard clenched tight but something
powerful is battering away beneath the surface and as he
walks slowly down among the bodies of his men Sammy creeps
along beside him tracking him with the baby carriage dolly

As the camera moves with Angelo the “dead men” behind him
scramble to their feet and race around behind the camera to
set up again in FRONT of Angelo They hit the dirt just as
Angelo reaches them and Sammy pans to take in the “new”
carnage - twenty American soldiers strewn across the desert
in the positions and postures of their final agonies

Angelo walks through the bodies and out into empty desert
Sammy keeps filming but Sammy takes his eye off the camera
leaving it running on the tripod Angelo overwhelmed
openly weeps with his back to the camera Sammy stares at
Angelo’s retreating form his thoughts elsewhere

SAL
Uh Sammy How far you gonna let

A walkway Sammy walks among them warily his eyes peeled
for Logan and Chad and their gang Parched he stops at a
long drinking fountain with three spigots He hesitates
before taking a drink remembering Chad’s threat Since no
one threatening is nearby he decides to go for it He bends
down to take a drink just as he does another boy bends in
to drink This startles Sammy who jumps away

Sammy is studying this thinking when he hears sounds coming
from below

A boy moans a girl moans then the sounds of French kissing
Sammy tiptoes down a few steps then cautiously leans over
the railing to see who’s making these sounds Unable to see
he descends further treading very quietly

Finally he can see a couple making out a red-haired GIRL
and Logan rubbing against her kissing her his hands all
over her sweater

RED-HAIRED GIRL
Logan I’m really really missing
you
Sammy’s transfixed prurient and horny till it registers how
dangerous this situation is He starts to climb up again but
trips one knee striking a stair tread

(turning to Claudia)
But hey you know maybe uh your
boyfriend should apologize to you
for making out in the stairwell

Everyone freezes Logan turns immediately to Claudia who
looks stricken He flashes his signature smile

LOGAN
He’s lying He’s - I didn’t do

Sammy’s in his bedroom so filled with rage he doesn’t know
what to do with himself Lying in bed he stares at the
shadows on the bedroom wall created by a streetlight of
leaves on a tree outside moved by a strong breeze

A light rain begins to fall Sammy looks at the shadows of
the raindrops streaming down the wall intermingling with the
leaves He raises his hand and watches its shadow move among
the shifting lines made by the light streaming through the
rain-streaked window

Grief anger and terror rise up in him he’s frightened at
the size of his feelings He breathes starting to panic He
tries to calm himself by focusing on the shadows of the
swirling leaves and streaming water

He sits up suddenly then kneels on the floor and from
underneath his bed he pulls the box containing the Bolex H-8
Reflex camera He opens the box and lifts the brand-new
camera for the first time examines it He puts it to his
ear He pushes the release button Closing his eyes
listening to the whirr of the camera’s motor

Filming is what he loves and Oh Jesus Christ

of what a a vocation a Let’s go to your place or

show me the camera -
BURT

(trying to make light of
it but underneath he’s
angry )
Alright alright we’ll rent him
the equipment

REGGIE

He hates the beach that’s why he
doesn’t want to go to Ditch Day

BURT
I have respect for everything he

Mitzi and Hadassah asks Sammy who ignores her

SAMMY
What No I’m not I never said that
I was scared of them

HADASSAH
You got beat up

MITZI
(to Burt )
You always dismiss what he does
what anyone does that’s playful or
imaginative as a pastime or a hobby-

BURT
You already won Mitts I
surrendered I’m not taking the

MITZI SAMMY
(to Burt) (to his parents)
Who’s baiting who I said I’d Can you guys please cut it

Well you say you will but I guess
you don’t mean it So I ask again

lap Sammy stands up abruptly and slams the table
Conformed Draft 113

SAMMY

Hadassah scratches Bennie’s head

HADASSAH

Sammy looks at his family then smiles an idea is forming
He says to Monica

SAMMY

borrowing the camera

MONICA
He’ll say yes

SAMMY
Thank you I’m filming Ditch Day I

EXT SANTA CRUZ MAIN BEACH - DAY 119

“Goodbye Cruel World” plays as Sammy wielding Monica’s dads
Arriflex 16-S arrives at the beach where a massive banner
welcomes “GRAND VIEW HIGH CLASS OF ‘64” Monica rushes to
join him carrying a shoulder rig for the camera

The students have fanned out across the beach They’re
swimming sunning chasing each other building sand castles
and burying each other in the sand Sammy Monica assisting
films all of this

Students use beach blankets to playfully toss a girl back and
forth while Sammy films and Monica cheers

Sammy notices Logan in a lively game of beach volleyball
leaping high in the air and spiking a ball

At a long table Sammy films several students having a hot
dog-eating contest

Monica and some sunbathers stage a gag for Sammy Monica
stands directly above one of the sunbathers then drops a
small glob of vanilla ice cream onto his forehead

with his camera

Sammy films Claudia and Monica passing under a limbo bar
together Logan watches from the crowd and catches Claudia’s
eye but she turns her back on him But when Logan goes under
the bar next Claudia can’t help but watch She walks off and
Monica goes to drape herself on Sammy as he keeps filming
She nuzzles into his cheek until he gets the hint and lets
her peer through the viewfinder

heard under the footage

Sammy behind the lens heads up the walkway to the front
door Burt Reggie Natalie and Lisa are excited Mitzi
glances at the house’s unfinished exterior promising to
become a handsome generously-proportioned A-Frame She looks
away out at the view

The girls rush inside followed by Burt and the camera It
follows the girls exploring - the boxed appliances in the
kitchen the hall leading to their new rooms Then the
camera pans to the front window where Mitzi stands looking
in Burt knocks and waves to her and gestures to Sammy to
shoot her Burt plants a big kiss on Mitzi then runs into the
expansive sun-soaked living room miming where her grand
piano will live The girls run back in and Burt lines them
up in the living room and has Sammy frame the front door

He rushes outside and sweeps Mitzi in his arms like a bride
silhouetted by the strong sun behind them As Burt carries
Mitzi over the threshold towards the camera their faces
growing distinct the film slows down till it advances one
frame at a time then finally it freezes on a frame of Burt
happy and proud and Mitzi staring at the camera with a sad
lost smile

sob rises up from deep inside him and to his and Sammy’s
horror he starts to cry
