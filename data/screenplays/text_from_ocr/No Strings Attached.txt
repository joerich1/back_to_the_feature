INT PAVILLION CAMP WEEHAWKEN-- IGHT-

1994 A summer camp in- Northern Michigan

over-enthusiastic counselor with a massive boombox stereo

Coolios Fantastic Voyage blasts

About ten thirteen-year-old boys are lined up along the

Hair down to their ears and parted in the middle-- little
and

year -

deep

versions of Kurt Cobain or Jord Catalano

They are staring at a group of dancing girls - In the middle
is KATIE the blonde who grew boobs before anyone else And
every time she moves she bounces

The boys watch her serious concentrating They need to
remember this for later Katie continues to bounce- One boy
suddenly looks down scared

BOY
It tickles

OTHER BOY-
Yeah It does other stuff
But theres a boy on the edge of the group A sweet face

you wouldnt be surprised to- find but hes Jewish A 12

old Adam Kurtzman Hes the only boy not looking at Katie
Instead hes staring off in another direction

On the other side of the dance floor next to an ‘enormously

fat kid theres Emma Shes an awkward 12 Wearing borrowed
clothes- a skirt thats a little too long a top that she
cant fill out Shes taller than any of the boys But
theres something in her eyes like shes laughing at
everything

She makes eyecontact with Adam She squints He takes -a
breath She squints some more He walks over-
ADAM
Hey -
EMMA
Hey
A long pause -Theyre not looking at each other Then
ADAM
Do you want to freak
