INT HOUSE - DAY

The top floor of an old drafty Craftsman home Dark mostly
empty maybe abandoned The only sound is a repeated low-
register WHISTLE It has a solemn or devotional quality to
it like the sound of an empty soda bottle on the beach

We PUSH slowly through the darkness floorboards creaking
toward an OPEN CLOSET Details begin to emerge Old clothes
in garment bags desiccated house plant a tennis racquet
with a broken string The detritus of a past life Suddenly
deeper in the closet SOMETHING STIRS

We stop It stops

A BEAT

It shifts Emerging from behind the tennis racquet it is-
A TENNIS BALL

It rolls a little ways into the hallway toward us Nothing
pushing or pulling it No visible strings and no obvious

force acting on it that might explain this behavior

It stops suddenly rotates left then right like checking
both ways at a crosswalk

It banks a left navigating around a bra on the floor and
continues casually out of frame

We linger on the closet what the fck

INT FIRST FLOOR LANDING-

Downstairs is the same Cobwebs neglected house plants
discolored squares on the wall mark where pictures used to
hang Through the silence we hear

THUDTHUDTHUD

The TENNIS BALL descending the stairs

THUD-THUD-THU-THU-THU-—

THWACK It hits the landing with force

TENNIS BALL (MUFFLED FROM WITHIN)
- Ow

It reorients itself then pushes past us toward the living
room

INT LIVING ROOM- CONTINUOUS

Crossing the living room it navigates over rugs around
couch legs etc until-

DEAN (VO)
I was asking if its been
difficult this transition for you

MARCEL (VO)
Eh Not in the way that I think you
would think it would be but-—

The ball slams into a chair leg

TENNIS BALL
-Ugh

MARCEL (VO)
Yeah

It reverses corrects course continuing toward
THE PICTURE WINDOW-

Underneath the WINDOWSILL the ball rolls to a stop lightly
bonking the wall

MARCEL (VO)
Its pretty much common knowledge
that it takes at least 20 shells to
have a community Thats the
minimum you need to survive So I
think at first I was thinking
Were not going to make it

CLOSE UP

The BALL shifts rocking back and forth to build momentum
EFFORT NOISES growing from within and finally- Pop A FLAP on
the ball swings open

MARCEL tumbles out He is a one-inch tall snail shell with a
single googly eye wearing a pair of sneakers He is not- to
be clear- a snail or slug or any kind of little crustacean
who inhabits a shell He simply is a shell
With shoes on

MARCEL (VO
But sometimes you just have to
disregard those rules and think
well actually the rule is that I
want to be having a good life and
stay alive and not just survive
but have a good life

He climbs out of the ball and clomps over to a PULL CORD
dangling from the window shade

He hops onto it yanking the cord downward and activating its
PULL MECHANISM-

ZIIIP The cord with Marcel on it flies up out of frame as
THUNK The blinds themselves drop and

UGH Marcel LEAPS off the cord as it arrives beside the
windowsill Ta-da A perfect makeshift elevator

MARCEL marches to the other side of the windowsill where he
throws his weight against the TILT ROD that controls the
angle of the BLINDS It begins to turn and finally

MARCEL (VO)
This is what I have to do to get

by

WHOOSH The blinds turn- MORNING LIGHT pours in through the
open window brightening the room- Street noise filters in-
Wind rustling leaves distant foot traffic the morning
commute

EXT BACKYARD - DAY

Marcel hauls a heavy (for him) NYLON ROPE across the lawn
toward a GINGKO TREE

MARCEL (VO)
I appreciate its different beauties
but its not the way I would have
done things if I was still in the
group

He drops the rope at the base of the tree surveys a homemade
knot
CLOSE UP- MOMENT LATER

The ROPE now cinched to a particular BRANCH that is heavy
with GINGKO BERRIES

MARCEL (VO)
My dad Mario and all of his
sisters would be out on the limb
and theyd be jumping up and down
on it to make the tree shake But
theyre not here
We FOLLOW the rope as it snakes down the tree to the ground
through grass and across the yard where it disappears into
the house through an OPEN WINDOW and
MARCEL (VO)
So thats why I have the electric
mixer

INT KITCHEN-

--LANDS at the foot of a heavy ELECTRIC STAND MIXER The
ROPE is tied to the ROTATING ELEMENT

MARCEL
Ready

DEAN (0S)
Go for it
Marcel kicks the START button- MIXER whirs to life yanking
the rope-
CLOSE ON ROPE
It WHIPS back and forth
CLOSE ON BRANCH

The rope shakes the tree violently causing the BERRIES to
fall and

CLOSE ON GRASS

hit the ground with gentle thumps and

BACK IN THE KITCHEN-—

Marcel observes his handiwork from the windowsill He turns
MARCEL (PROUDLY)
Ta-da
EXT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER
Marcel checks the state of the berries from the fallen bunch
MARCEL (TO HIMSELF)

-kinda squishedYoure too
firmToo firm

MARCEL (VO)
And then the rest of us would be
down here just collecting all the
berries

MARCEL (TO HIMSELF)
Too firmWeird shape
(finding one)
Ah-ha And the winner is All
right lets get it rolling baby
Youre coming with me

He rolls the gingko berry out of frame

EXT BACK YARD - MOMENT LATER

Marcel pushing the berry slowly making his way toward a
dilapidated TREE HOUSE He stops exhausted starts just
kicking the thing instead

The grass is tall and overgrown so we cant actually see him-
just the berry popping up each time he punts it From a

nearby drainage pipe a family of JUMPING SPIDERS looks on
indifferent

MARCEL (VO)
There are actually only two of us
now

INT DINING ROOM- DUSK

TRACK through an empty dining room full of huge-seeming
human-sized furniture an ancient oak dinner table toward
sounds of LAUGHTER echoing from wellWHERE Another life
The distant past

We LAND instead at the foot of a small CHINA HUTCH where
inset is a second much smaller DINING ROOM and-
INT SECOND SMALLER DINING ROOM- CONTINUOUS

PUSHING IN we find Bistro-style CHAIRS fashioned out of
WINE MUSELETS A dinner table made from plastic PIZZA
TOPPERS neatly appointed with HANDKERCHIEF TABLECLOTH a
pair of QUARTERS for dinner plates (DIMES for salad
naturally) Illuminating the space are a bouquet of half-
melted BIRTHDAY CANDLES standing on end a la tiki torches

This is the source of all the laughter MARCEL is seated
across from another shell CREATURE- his grandmother NANA
CONNIE (80s Italian accent tougher than she looks) Theyre
post-meal singing-laughing-roasting each other crumbs
everywhere a drip too much wine maybe had

MARCEL (VO)
Myself and my grandmother Nana
Connie

Marcel cracks a joke and Connie- LOSES her shit

SLOW MOTION as she tosses her head back cackling- crying-
beautiful in the flickering light- Hers is a warm summer
exterior concealing all the hardscrabble winters

MARCEL (VO)
Back when the Man and the Woman
lived here there were a lot of us

CLOSE ON REFRIGERATOR-

On the door FADED PHOTOS of a HUMAN COUPLE (MARK and
LARISSA we will learn) happy and in love Above them is a
newer not-so-faded LAMINATED WELCOME CARD Welcome to our
AirBnB

MARCEL (VO)
There were more sounds and
smells

SUN ROOM-—

Track past a variety of wilted HOUSE PLANTS Between the
branches we see a network of tiny TREEHOUSES and FOOT
BRIDGES all constructed from popsicle sticks and repurposed
human garbage all now abandoned

LIVING ROOM-
The shelf of a neglected BAR CART Amidst a forest of

champagne flutes is a miniature PARISIAN-STYLE CAFE now
defunct shrouded in cobwebs
MARCEL (VO) (CONTD)
-and there were things to say
because there were more people to
talk to

INT DINING ROOM WITHIN DINING ROOM- NIGHT

Connie reenters frame dragging a stack of VHS TAPES into
place to serve as a stage Marcel climbs the stairs

CONNIE
The Stage

MARCEL (VO)
These days its quieter

Connie has a seat on a cork in the front row Marcel clears
his throat and sings

MARCEL
One two three
(singing)
Hm-mm I want to linger

A little longer here with you

EXT HOUSE - DUSK

End of day- sun slipping behind trees- the neighborhood grows
dark save for the small TWINKLING LIGHTS in the one single

EXT TREE — DAY

The ROTTED PLYWOOD LADDER of what was probably once a kids
treehouse Marcel stands atop one of the slats eyeing a
length of TWINE which is stretched taut (like a TIGHTROPE) to
something off-screen Dangling underneath the tightrope is a
TODDLER-SIZED ATHLETIC SNEAKER with the shoelaces looped over
the twine to form a ZIP LINE

Marcel tiptoes a little ways out onto the twine until hes
directly above the sneaker then dives off cannon-balling
into the open sneakerzipline carriage below

This generates enough bounce that the shoe is jostled from
its resting place and begins to slide down the rope

WIDE SHOT
As the SNEAKER with Marcel in it zips toward camera

MARCEL
Aaaaaah

HARD CUT

EXT WINDOWSILL- MOMENTS LATER

Marcel is now safely on the other side of the zip line which
ends at a windowsill off the kitchen He climbs out of the
sneaker dropping down

of torn rags and bound lengths ofHUMAN HAIR

LESLEY STAHL delivers her to-camera intro in the 60 Minutes
studio

LESLEY STAHL
Good things come in small packages
Its an old idea As journalists
were always trying to dispense
with those always trying to find
fresh angles on a story But
tonight in the only interview hes
given since becoming an Internet
phenom Marcel the Shell will ask
us to look twice at what we take
for granted to discover new
meaning in the simplest ideas
Marcel a one-inch tall-shell
reminds us of the true value of
community the transformative power
of friendship and yes the most
ingenious use for a tennis ball

Lesley chuckles as we cut to

friendship

Dean and Lesley laugh
BACK TO THE INTERVIEW

LESLEY STAHL
Marcel how long has it been since
youve seen your family

MARCEL

Well I dont do the clock the way
that you guys do the clock But Im
watching the changes in the trees
and the flowers that have bloomed
and the blossoms that have fallen
The buds that have come and bloomed

and louder every day

LESLEY STAHL

into a shelter plan

MARCEL

window that is always open a little
crack there

Marcel arrives on the sill enjoys the breeze

MARCEL (VO)
I would stand there and sometimes
I would tell her things Ask for
advice Or just let sounds come out
of my mouth

And one day I was just sitting
and the wind blew in And it blew
just over my head in such a way and
made a beautiful whistling sound

DEAN (0S)
What kind of noise is it

MARCEL
Shh shh shh Listen

The wind blows through Marcels shell creating a LOW
PLAINTIVE HUM

MARCEL
Can you hear it Thats it Thats
going through my shell

WIDE ON THE ROOM

Its a normal laundry room But in this moment in this
afternoon light in this breeze we feel something
transcendent

MARCEL (VO)
It felt just like her to lead me to
a place where I would experience
something new and special

It connected me I felt to
everything Because if I wasnt
there the sound would never exist
I felt like everything was in
pieces but when I stood there
suddenly we were one large
instrument

I like to go there a lot Because
it reminds me that Im not just one
separate piece rattling around in
this place but that Im part of a
whole And I truly enjoy the sound
of myself connected to everything

Marcel sits on an eraser looking out the window His shell
HUMS with the wind
