SCREENPLAY

Directors note The first minutes of this movie will be shot according
to the principle of subjective vision whereby the camera sees everything
through the eyes of Oscar our main character We will follow his
nervous eye movements and if the practical reality imposes a breakdown
within the scenes the different shots will be imperceptibly linked when he
blinks or during his rapid panoramic eye-movements

As his mouth will be out of his field of vision his voice will of course be
heard OS as though coming from the camera The action will pass in real
time as perceived by Oscar So during the first minutes of the movie
there will be no ellipses (except when he passes out) no variation in the
shooting speed end no change in focal

In order to transmit this cinematic bias the screenplay has been written in
the first person as the use of I is better for describing the actions of the
characters as perceived by Oscar thus the spectator

1 - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(EXTERIOR BALCONY DUSK)

The full movie credits (production direction cast
technical crew) appear on the black screen as succinctly
as possible

Then a date 27 September 1999 that finally disappears

A dramatic rumbling grows
As it explodes into a roar a word written in huge white
letters appears over the whole breadth of the screen

ENTER

At the same time a magnificent twilight sky appears
behind these letters Heavy orange white and purple-
hazed clouds scudding over a bright red sky

The word disappears off the top of the screen

NOR
High rise buildings and apartment blocks modern or not
with terraces covered in billboards tower in the distance
under the clouds A small light gray airplane crosses the
sky and silently rises up towards the clouds A white
’ fluffy line trails across the sky in its wake

Me - Do you like flying

Moira (OS) No

Me - Why not

I turn to my sister Moira We are leaning over the railing
of my balcony watching the dense multicolored sky in
the mild late-summer dusk

Moira is young but her self-confidence belies her age 20
Her opulent bust is squeezed into a slightly worn golden
yellow dress Her hair is black and her broken nose
makes her face look masculine She is beautiful The sun
casts its pink and orange rays over her

As I havent been given an answer I turn back to look at
the plane

Moira (OS) - Im scared

The plane disappears into a cloud

Moiras light-colored eyes go off into a daze

Me - Scared of what

Moira - well of dying

Moira catches my eye for a second then looks down The
wind suddenly picks up

She shivers crosses her arms over her half-bared breasts
and leaves the balcony I follow her

Me - They say you fly when you die

Moira doesnt seem to have heard me

We go into our bedroom brightly colored but pretty dirty
and messy

2 - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR STUDIO DUSK)

Moira picks up a white cardigan and some sexy clothes
from one of the two single beds and puts them into a bag
The room is littered with both our belongings
Moira puts her cardigan on and checks the time on the
alarm clock Then she picks up her bag and hurries over
to the door

Moira - See you later

She turns round in the doorway and smiles at me But my
eardrums suddenly block and the sounds all disappear
Silence We look at each other

Then the sounds come back

I snap to and look away

Me - See ya

The door closes behind Moira

I go over to my bed and sit down

I look for a stub of a joint in an ashtray I swiped from a
bar

I light it

I stretch out and smoke it staring at the ceiling

A few seconds later I stub the filter out in the ashtray
Then my hand gropes for the light switch on the wall and
flicks it

The light goes out

Blackness

Street sounds breeze in through the window People
talking A song in the distance A truck rumbling by
Steam outlets belch out sweaty puffs against the wall of
my room And from somewhere further off come the
droning vibrations of the neighboring dressmaking
workshops

The sounds slowly disappear
3 - DREAM
(INTERIOR DREAM TOILET STALL NIGHT)

‘An image with a dark badly-defined outline forms

I open a door and go into a recess with peeling walls A
slab in the middle with a hole bored in it evokes a squat-
down toilet The slab is splattered with purplish stains
and dribbles I step back towards the door but it has
disappeared now replaced by a smooth wall The stains
seep outwards as though absorbed by the walls My eyes
are drawn back to the hole in the middle of the slab It
has grown

Above me a white light bulb starts vibrating as does the
whole room This phenomenon is accompanied by a loud
whistling sound

I fall down on the ground with my head at the edge of the
hole Looking down it I suddenly see the foundations of
the building receding further and further away as though
a strange force had abruptly wrenched the room away
from the building it was in Its like the room is soaring
vertically at great speed The lights of the city disappear
dizzily beneath my eyes The axis of the room starts to
tilt I suddenly look away two hands grab me by the feet
and pull me towards the door that has reappeared and is
now open

A phone rings loudly somewhere

The dream dissolves

Directors Note During this dream sequence Oscar will like in most
dreams perceive the silhouette of his own body i in the foreground dark
and blurred within a kind of Semi-subjective vision The corners of the
image will be darkened
4 - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR STUDIO NIGHT)

J open my eyes night has already fallen in my room To

the right of the bed the phone is ringing in the darkness
I pick it up ‘half asleep A nervous voice crackles down
the other end

Victor (OS) - Oscar Its Victor

Me - Oh its you Ive been looking for you

Victor (OS) - Can you bring me my E

Me - Come by and get them

Victor (OS) - Yeah but I I Cant you bring them
Me - Where are you

Silence -

Victor (OS) - Come by the bar Im here Ill explain
Me - Sure yeah To be honest Id rather

Victor (OS) - See you in a bit

Me - Listen Victor Im sorry about what happened
yesterday

But the line goes dead

Me - Hello Hello

I hang up and stay stretched out on the bed

The curtains on the balcony doors fiutter in the wind
Then I get up in the dark I rub my eyes and head for the
bathroom

I flick the neon light above the basin on rinse my head
and look at myself in the mirror

The cold neon light flickers and hums above me
Someone knocks on the door

I grab a violet-colored towel and dry my face

I cross the messy though virtually empty room The
walls are white The table and the two unmatched
salvaged chairs are made out of old wood

Directors Note When he looks in the mirror we finally discover
Oscars face he is about 20 dark brown hair slim with nervous
intelligent eyes
lean up against the door and look through the spy-hole
I see the distorted figure of a man wearing a fabulous
plebe-pop shirt with a pointed collar

I open the door

Me - Alex

Alex comes in and glances at the mess in the room He is
about ten years older than me

I close the door behind him and finish drying my face
Alex - I just ran into your sister

Me - Yeah she left ten minutes ago

Alex - She was with whats his name Mario

Me - Oh Jesus That creep gets on my nerves You know
what Id like to do Blast his brains out By the way
what time is it

Alex (smiling) - Ten after ten What have you got
against the guy Your sisters hot shit its normal hes
running after her I like her too you know

Me (annoyed by this conversation) - Anyway she doesnt
give a shit about men She was always going with girls at
the home

Alex snickers a dreamy look on his face

Me - Right Victors waiting for me at the bar You
coming withme

Alex hesitates then nods He sits down in an old beat-up
armchair picks up a book off the top of a pile and flicks
through it

I pick my shirt up off the chair and put it on

Alex (OS) - Have you read it then

I turn round to see which book hes talking about On the

cover printed with a pretty colored mandala I read the

title The Tibetan Book of the Dead”

Me - Yeah but can I keep it another week

Alex - Sure

Me - Its like a maze I want to re-read it

Alex flicks through the book while I finish dressing
Alex - Its one of the greatest theories on the next world
know of especially the passage with the colored lights
that want to carry you off to a higher plane and the bit
about reincarnation being seen as a failure of the spirit
Me - Oh yeah I liked that bit best when you see death
trying to reincarnate itself among all those people making
love

As we leave I go over to the little fridge I open the ice-
box take out a tupperware and open it too Inside is a
transparent bag containing 40 grayish round pills A
dozen other pills are scattered loose in the tupperware

I put the transparent bag in my pocket and put the rest
away in the freezer Alex watches me

Alex - Is all that for Victor

Me - Well yeah We made a bulk buy

Then I turn out the lights in the apartment Alex puts the
book back on the pile and gets up We go out

5 - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR STAIRCASE NIGHT)

Were out on the landing I gesture to Alex to go down
while I lock up I check the door is firmly locked Then I
crouch down by the stairs leading up to the next floor I
stretch my hand out to one of the wooden steps I lift up
the corner of an old slat and slip the keys underneath it I
put the slat back in place stand up and run down the
Stairs to the ground floor I go out into the street

6 - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(EXTERIOR STREET BAR IN DEAD-END ALLEY NIGHT)

Alex is waiting for me outside I walk over to him and
we set off Even at night the street is still very lively In
front of my building the caretaker is hauling the trash
cans inside We turn left and go past a small grocery
store run by Asians thats still open this late at night
Further on we go past a sandwich and beer stand Four
skinny nervous junkies in dirty clothes are hanging out
in font of it Further still an old bum is sleeping sprawled
in a doorway barefoot Other bums are sitting on cars
slugging down alcohol from a plastic bottle Two police
vans are parked on the sidewalk opposite like its their
usual spot The district seems to be a pretty bad side of
town

Alex - I read a book today Youd like it Its the story of
two friends who promise that whoever dies first will
¢ome back to tell the other one what happens after you
die Then the younger one dies in an accident The other
one buries him and waits for some news Months go by
and he doesnt get a single message So he curses his
dead friend and curses life for not going on to something
else But then this shelf falls on his head And he dies
too He meets up with his dead friend on the other side
who tells him hes been trying non-stop to communicate
with him but that the living cant hear the dead and
thats the way nature goes So the only thing he could
think of to keep his promise and prove the new world
existed was to make him die too He explains that hes the
one that made the shelf fall But the one whos just died
hurls himself at his own corpse and tries to re-integrate it
It works And he comes back to life But he has forgotten
his meeting with his friend and everything he saw

We are walking under the electric glow of street lamps
and neon store signs Some of them cast greenish light on
us others are more pink

Alex keeps talking and I walk alongside him in silence
checking out the scene His words are like a kind of
music and I stop listening to him from time to time
Through the windows of some apartments we can make
out neon-lit workshops or shabby interiors lit up by the
blue flicker of a TV screen

Alex - Hey Are you listening

Me - Yeah sure Hang on I missed the end

Alex - No I mean You know the dead guy was
trying everything to communicate with his living friend
but there was no way he could do it So as the other one
started doubting in the existence of the next world the
first one could only find one solution make the other one
die So he arranged for a shelf to fall on his head and the
other one died too Hey youre still not listening are
you

A
i
Me - Im sory

Having reached the corner of the street we turn right and
fall smack into a heated discussion over some deal
between two girls wearing miniskirts and jackets The tall
‘guy with them pushes them into a large doorway to
continue the discussion in peace

A large wall’ topped with billboards and wire fencing
looms in the background This concrete anthracite-gray
50ft wall could be the wall to a factory a barracks or a

prison Huge and insurmountable it stretches all the way -

down the street

Me - But in fact I dont get it Whats the moral of
the story

Alex - Well dont look for a moral Its just that
Alex takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket

Alex - You cant keep that kind of promise

Me - Yeah well theres one thing Ive promised myself
one of these days Im gonna bust Marios head in

Alex laughs

Alex - Be careful He looks like a hard nut

Me - True Apparently hes even been inside

Alex - Oh yeah I saw him more as being buddy-buddy
with the cops

Me - Thats where you learn to lick their asses

Alex - Talking of cops

He motions me to look left further down the street some
cops are inspecting the ID of two black guys

I shut up Alex glances rapidly at me Hes uneasy So
am I Were walking by a newspaper booth set
precariously in the middle of the sidewalk so I stop to
buy something anything Next to a few evening papers
and tabloids is an Aids Prevention poster recommending
tests A single neon light gleams above the rack A
collection of lottery tickets hang on the other side
announcing the big August 30 draw

Me - Id like a ticket the one at the top

A beautiful working class-looking woman hands me one
of the tickets I pay and pocket the change avoiding her
guard dog Before leaving Alex takes a cigarette out of a
pack and offers it to me I wave it away

Alex - You should be more paranoid about walking
around with stuff like that on you especially E you
know with these new laws theyve got now its as risky
as smack

I dont answer

Alex - But why didnt Victor come to your place

I falter Alex lights his cigarette and throws the match
away

Me - He learned about my thing with his mom you
know And we had a fight Ill tell you later

Alex - Oh shit

He grimaces

We carry on our way and a few yards further on arrive
in front of a dead-end alley At the bottom is a seedy bar
called the Here or There The name is stenciled in large
letters on the windows either side of the door One of the
windows has a spidery crack on it that has been roughly
patched up with sticky tape Alex stops

Alex - Oh this place I cant stand the owner Id rather
wait for you here

He points to a pillar opposite the entrance to a porn
theater

I nod and turn in to a dead-end lined with crumbling
walls with the brickwork showing through

Two white men dressed half-thug half-sporty but clean-
shaven are leaning against the door They watch me go
in without breaking off their discussion

7 - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR BAR NIGHT)

Victor a small fat guy my age is waiting inside the bar
He is sitting at a table on his own The rest of the room is
almost empty Fluorescent tubes fill the bar with a
flickering cold light Depending on the tube the light is
predominantly greenish or bluey

Pala
’
Behind the counter the owner is quietly changing the
channel on the TV perched up above him

I sit down opposite Victor

He seems very agitated

Victor (hushed voice - Please forgive me

I notice a bruise on Victors face

Me - What

Victor - They made me do it

He looks down then back up again towards the entrance
The two men in jogging pants stare at me from the
doorway then head over Behind them I catch sight of a
police car turning into the dead-end and blocking the
entrance to the bar My heart flutters

I instinctively get up and head nervously towards the
toilets

I find myself in front of a small gray door As I open it I
glance quickly behind me The two policemen are
following me through the bar and reaching into their
jackets

I hurry into the toilets

and - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR TOILETS NIGHT)

Inside is a washbasin and two doors I open the one with
a man on it and slip inside

9 SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR SQUAT-DOWN TOILET NIGHT)

I lock the bolt behind me Its a seatless squat-down
toilet with light blue walls

A policeman (OS) - Hes in there

With jittering hands I take the bag out of my pocket and
throw it into the hole of the john I pull the chain but it
has a leak and the water pressure is too weak to flush the
bag away In my panic I hadnt thought of taking the pills
out I try to ram it down the hole with my foot In vain
The police are already trying to break the door down
Two more officers come in shouting threats and
warnings Im going crazy in front of the bag still floating
in the murky hole I see a small square window 12
inches wide that I wont be able to escape through
Theres no way out

The police are kicking at the door and I lose all control
The lock is going to give any moment now Suddenly in
a rush of adrenalin I find a way of gaining time

Me - Keep back or Ill shoot

It was double or quits but I am satisfied to hear the
confusion my threats have incurred on the other side of
the door The cops have stopped kicking the door and
have no doubt stepped back Fired up by my success I
yell at them again just to make sure theyve got it

Me - Step back Im going to shoot

Then making the most of the lull I turn back to the bag
still floating in the hole It has filled up with water and a
few pills have floated out Im seized with panic again
Fear and the noise of the chain that Im yanking like a
maniac while blocking the door with my foot prevent
me from understanding what one of the cops is shouting
at me Everything gets confused Intense fear has made
the bag floating in the middle of the hole in the slab the
only thing that exists for me I dont understand what
theyre shouting at me I brace myself against the door
my eyes riveted to the packet Then suddenly a violent
detonation rings out one of the policemen has just fired
his gun at the lock It shatters I mechanically pull on the
chain again But I discover a red stain seeping over the
left side of my chest A wound The bullet must have
ripped through my ribs too I try to stem the blood flow
with my right hand I grope the open flesh under the
seared cotton Most sounds are muffled except the ones
real close by

The policemen push on the door and I fall to my knees
The door finally bursts open And I collapse sprawled on
the floor with my head at the edge of the hole

The old white slab is splattered with stains and scale A
trickle of blood dribbles along the surface and into the
hole The broken toilet is still spitting out spurts of water
It splatters onto the policemans trainers as he rapidly pats
me down making my head shake

A policeman (OS) - Hes not armed

Fhen with one hand he grabs the half-torn bag now full of
blood and water and a few of the pills that fell out of it
Policeman (OS) - But heres the gear

The sounds go dull and muffled as though my ear
pressure had suddenly changed

A screech rips through my eardrums Then disappears
The colors in the john slowly brighten and become grayer
and colder I am shivering all over My vision starts to
quiver as much as my body Feverish white dots spin in
front of my eyes

My breathing is jerky I am suffocating I can hardly
even groan The noises from the bar seem very close
The policemen are talking heatedly together The feet
disappear

All of a sudden I cough blood onto the slab and over my
arm I try to lift my hand but it does not react just one
finger moves imperceptibly My eyes stop moving at the
same time as my body My vision suddenly freezes and
starts to darken Dark blurry shadows cover my vision
which is black in places

The sounds gradually fade

After a few final efforts my breathing cuts off and seems
to be carried away by the jerky trickling of the water My
heart strikes its last beats It stops for good Time stops
too And so does my life

A violent ripping sound tears through space

Then silence

Then blackout

10 - BLACKOUT
(BLACK IMAGE)

Out of the blackness comes a calm muffled liquid

rippling

The gurgling of the flushing system changes texture
Then dull thudding sounds come near Snatches of voices
float up

A man (OS) - Shit Hes dying

Another man (OS) - Calm down Its not your fault
Fists hammer against a door

First man (OS) - Fuck fuck fuck

His voice echoes strangely

My perception of sound seems to shift in space The
trickling of the toilet gets nearer now clear and peaceful
It swells until it sounds like a waterfall tumbling into a
lake

11 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR SQUAT-DOWN TOILET NIGHT)

Then the image of the stall gradually reappears but
altered as though transformed into something unknown
It is comprised of a partly hazy semi-translucent matter
intersected by light rays The cold lights of the bar room
filter through the brick wall My pink flesh and
motionless veins are showing through the skin of my
paralyzed arm My vision is slowly moving slipping out
of the logical viewpoint of my eyes to such an extent that
when it stops I get the impression I can see part of my
own face This is not normal

Then the darkness returns and a new sound starts the
sound of a muffled wind sweeping into a tunnel

12 - THE TUNNEL
(INTERIOR ABSTRACT TUNNEL)

Little by little a warm distant light appears from the
heart of the darkness Its rays reveal an obscure tunnel
shiny and damp in parts but with darkened edges

The white light at the far end draws me towards it A few
thin golden rays even seem to reach me through this
space

I head slowly and steadily towards the light turning in a
spiral through this endless dripping tunnel The harsh
ceaseless rushing of wind rumbles oppressively in this
tubular space

As I get nearer to the exit the rushing noise grows louder
and the walls brighten I discover that they are lined with
a colorless organic texture

I walk slowly out into the light

13 - WHITE LIGHT
(CLEAR PRIMAL LIGHT)

The white light fills the whole space criss-crossed with
gleaming golden rays

The wind turns into a calm majestic rumble

Thelight gets brighter

Increasingly beautiful

Up to total blinding white

The rumbling gets deafening and explodes A multitude
of crystal-clear sounds burst out of it

Then light particles and filaments suddenly appear in
motion but so white they can hardly be defined

Inside this storm of light particles all kinds of micro or
macroscopic spatial figures bond and split apart
apparently following a chaotic and never symmetrical
order But in their entirety they create a kind of visual
music obeying a calm underlying order that is quite
fascinating Like subliminal messages I think I can
perceive all kinds of familiar images (faces objects
landscapes) that are constantly shifting They form on

ue

the periphery of the white light appearing so fast I
cannot possibly identify them

But a bitter wind blows up from afar disturbing these
hypnotic circumvolutions With it come snatches of

» human voices One of them suddenly rings out right

nearby

A man (OS) ‘- His name is Oscar

My vision abruptly recoils The nature of the light
changes The edge of the white is gradually invaded by a
light blue Strangely enough it looks like it has some
kind of texture So it’s not the sky but a ceiling with
flaky paint now seen very close up And a 40 watt light
bulb gradually appears in the middle of it buzzing

14 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR SQUAT-DOWN TOILET NIGHT)

2 Its the light bulb inside the sky-blue stall
I turn round 180 degrees
And Im in the john Floating in the air like a spirit 10ft
off the ground
The police officer leans over my corpse and grabs it by
the feet in disgust His uniform gets stained with blood
My body is too heavy for him to move so he drops it
back onto the slab
He kicks the door open wider with his boot We can hear
one of his colleagues making fun of him The former
swears at him and carries on his task He steps over my
body grabs it by the arms and drags it towards the
washbasins in the adjoining room My body leaves red
trails behind it I follow flying alongside them
Then a new phenomenon occurs I go through the wall
and come out on the other side of the john I stop
wavering But theres no doubt about it my vision is
disembodied

Directors note From this scene on the movie will still be shot in
subjective vision but this time it will represent the vision of Oscars
disembodied spirit In other words contrary to the beginning of the
movie these “out of body” visions will no longer contain any reference to
his body whatsoever (no reflection in mirrors no leader of a ghostly
body in the foreground no blinking) As these out-of-body visions are
mental visions from Oscars dying brain their point of view can be
anywhere in the space they can cross matter and jump in time with no
physical contingency Less precise than the subjective visions Oscar had
when he was alive the consistence and logic of these out of body visions
will be closer to those of a dream yet particularly complex and bright
Settings and people will now be perceived in a slightly simplified form
for they are the synthesis of the reality oscar managed to store up during
his lifetime As the story progresses these visions will evolve parallel to
the decomposition of his brain The sets clothing and accessories will
gradually be reduced to their simplest expression

15 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR WASHROOM NIGHT)

Having crossed through the wall I find myself next to the
washbasins

My body is spread out in the middle of this pale yellow
room arms outstretched

I approach it My movements are clumsy and I often
abruptly change direction I float down towards my face
straight towards the eyes All of a sudden I plunge right
between the two eyes at the base of my forehead

I glimpse the dark spongy mass of my brain I leap
backwards and emerge out of my right eye which is
glazed and rigid I stop in front of it for a moment

Then my vision tilts slightly towards my mouth where a
trickle of blood has started to coagulate between the open
lips I finally turn off to the right and go through the
reddish darkness of my nostrils I come out just above my
left cheek I move along it flickering over the badly-
shaved skin From this close up the stubble looks like a
strange forest of chopped tree trunks Then a crevice
appears and my vision comes to a halt in front of a
landscape that must be the auricle of my left ear My
vision dives into it like plunging into the heart of a
volcano before heading into the skull again I see the
filamentous maze of my brains gray matter

I slide through these unrecognizable spaces

Suddenly a voice outside snaps me out of this strange
world

A policeman (OS) - Calm down We cant leave him
here

I float up into the room in an aborted spiral movement
When my vision comes to a standstill I can see my whole
body again

The policeman with the stained uniform comes back into
the room with the bar owner who Is totally blown away
by what is happening The owner hands him the
tablecloth he was carrying under his arm The policeman
covers my body with it My feet and my hands stick out

from underneath The tablecloth is sooa drenched in
blood I hear crying I am suddenly hauled backwards I
go through the wall between me and the bar

16 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR BAR NIGHT)

I find myself on the other side of the wall in front of a
painting hanging quite high on the wall an idyllic
mountain bathed in the last golden rays of a twilight sky
I forget everything and sink into contemplation of it But
then hear panic and tears in the room again My vision
swivels round

Below me Victor is slouched over the table crying Two
men are trying to shake him back to some kind of dignity
but its no use They try to make him sit up but Victor
clings on to the table They manhandle him He lets go of
the table and they manage to make him stand up In front
of the counter the owner is talking feverishly to Charlie
a young waiter with curly hair

Owner - Go tell his sister She must be at the Power
The waiter picks up his jacket and leaves

I go through the outer wall of the bar

17 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR DEAD-END ALLEY NIGHT)

I am floating above the dead-end

Charlie walks toward the street and comes across a guy
outside in the dead-end who wants to know whats going
on

Then I see Alex further off watching Charlie and trying
to figure out whats happening He has been alerted by
the police car (and the noise of gunfire perhaps) but
doesnt dare venture into the dead-end One of the
policeman comes out of the bar and goes over to his
colleague waiting for him behind the wheel of the car
They whisper a few words then the cop in the car calls
the station °

Alex is increasingly worried He turns away hesitantly
trying to look casual But one of the policemen notices
his nervous behavior
Policeman - Hey you Where are you going
’ Alex turns round The policeman walks over to him
Policeman - Show me your ID
Alex hesitates then takes his ID out He tries to look
casual The policeman examines the papers then stares at
Alex
Policeman - Wait here
He goes back to the car taking the papers with him Just
then the other two policemen come out of the bar with
Victor handcuffed and still crying Alex sees them
senses a major drama panics and runs off towards the
street without waiting for his papers The policemen turn
round
Policeman 1 - Hey you Stop
Just as Alex turns out of the dead-end another uniformed
policeman who was waiting just around the bend appears
out of nowhere alerted by the shouting He grabs his gun
but Alex carried away head-butts him right in the face
The policeman falls backwards blood streaming out of
his nose and drops his gun His back cracks against a
concrete post He screams He cannot get up The coast
is clear for Alex who dashes off On the sidewalk a
middle-aged onlooker with a misplaced sense of
citizenship tries to stop him But Alex easily gets away
and runs off
The policemen who were in the dead-end are too late to
follow him
But my vision catches up with him instantly

18 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR STREETS NIGHT)

I am flying over Alex who is running down the main
drag avoiding the passers-by giving him amused or

excited looks as he runs by without trying to stop him

Then he darts down a small deserted badly-lit street on

a7

—h
the right that leads him to another dark quiet street He
turns left

He glances over his shoulder from time to time to see if
he is being followed He runs past a few seedy
restaurants and closed stores then reaches a crossroads
He glances around then turns right

Further on Alex runs past a dark dead-end backstreet He
stops and doubles back A street lamp at the bottom lights
the back entrance of a nightclub The Power The name
is written on the heavy emergency exit doors The street
is deserted Alex hesitates and looks over his shoulder
No-one there He runs down to the bottom of the dead-
end and darts up the metal fire-escape that leads to the
upper floors of the club

He stops in front of the small door on the second floor
and presses his face up to look through the lit window
He looks reassured He glances behind him again then
knocks on the door while I go through the wall next to
the window

19 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(NIGHTCLUB DRESSING ROOM NIGHT)

I find myself inside a dressing room Moira is getting
dressed for her show She is wearing one of her fabulous
obscene pop outfits and is fixing her wig Her enormous
fake eyelashes make her look like a Barbie-doll Alex
knocks on the safety-exit again Moira walks warily over
to the door and opens it a crack Alex dashes inside
panting He closes the door behind him Moira looks at
him speechless

Alex - The bar was crawling with cops

Moira - What

Alex is leaning against the wall getting his breath back
Moira waits for the rest

Alex - I got the hell out of there But I think they got
Oscar He had a bag of E on him for Victor

He looks at the floor

Moira - So My brothers no dealer

Alex - I know
A bell rings in the dressing-room Alex jumps Moira
stares at the bell

Moira - I gotta go down now Wait here I wont be
tong

A siren wails through the city in the distance Alex
automatically’ huddles into a dark corner of the room His
forehead is covered in sweat and he still hasnt got his
breath back Moira walks hesitantly over to the window
and peeks out through the curtain

Alex - No-onell come in

Moira - No dont worry Ill lock the door

She takes her T-shirt off a slips a small black jacket on
over her naked chest before leaving the room Then she
doubles back switches the light off and leaves locking
the door behind her Alex stays alone in the purple half-
light cast by the street lamp outside

I leave the room via the wall above the old wooden door

20 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(CORRIDOR NIGHTCLUB NIGHT)

I emerge intothedeserted corridor just above Moira who
is walking nervously towards the stairs in her erotic
outfit She walks down the steps leading backstage

Time gets distorted Her footsteps and all sounds slow
down while the dull beat of music thuds out from the
main room Her toe-nails are painted red under her
fishnet stay-up stockings She is wearing very high-
heeled platform sandals and a miniskirt that is so short
you catch a glimpse of her white panties Her lips shine
deep red and ear-rings dangle from her ears

When she reaches the bottom of the stairs time goes back
to normal Moira straightens her clothes and stands
behind a semi-opaque curtain pulled across the opening to
the main room

She takes a cigarette out of her jacket pocket lights it and
absently smokes a few drags The trance music stops

—

-
She stubs her cigarette out and tenses up before pushing
the curtain open My vision accompanies her through the
wall

21 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(BACKSTAGE STAGE NIGHTCLUB NIGHT)

Moira is on the small stage in the club where a lot of
young clients are already dancing to the frantic
syncopated rhythm of a break-beat techno track A
symbolic obscenely-shaped metal lighthouse over 6ft high
towers at the foot of the stage The light goes on and the
rays start spinning round in the smoky room The
mechanism squeaks a little Moira steps into the light
onto the raised part of the stage Moving sensually she
posts herself defiantly in front of the dancers She parts
her jacket revealing one of her breasts to the public who
whistle with joy Then she starts dancing with precise
jerky movements striking increasingly sensual poses
The lighthouse gives off special lighting effects Red-
hued circles of light rise up the lighthouse in time with
the music Moira slowly lifts her miniskirt up revealing
her wonderful white G-string She takes a long time to
take it off with slow supposedly lewd movements She
playfully slides her G- -string into the open mouth of a
young bare-chested boy dancing ecstatically below her
His face is beaded with sweat as he nibbles on the panties
until Moira takes them out of his mouth Yet this doesnt
seem to disrupt his joy With her pussy in full view her
miniskirt hitched up to her hips and her jacket half open
my sister dances on her platform heels sliding her hands
between her thighs up onto her hips and back over her
ass The crowd is at fever pitch and a few girls start
imitating Moira without taking their clothes off

Just then Charlie weaves his way through the club His
presence brings me back to order and the music suddenly
seems to disappear My vision drifts away from my sister

and follows Charlie through the club up to the bar

Behind the bar a dark-haired stocky barman aged 35 is
busy serving the crowd

Charlie - Mario Mario

Mario the barman turns towards him

Charlie manages to push his way to the bar He leans
over and whispers something in his ear Mario looks
worried He abandons the clients steps out from behind
the bar and takes Charlie off to a corner of the club They
start talking but I cannot hear what they are saying
Mario looks at a loss He looks over at Moira My vision
pans over to her and the music comes blaring back I fly
quickly across the room skimming over the tables and
the clubbers back to Moira who is finishing off her show
with her legs spread open She appears to be playing with
herself with one hand while sucking on the middle finger
of her other hand miming an insatiable desire The music
reaches its climax The lighthouse is gleaming brighter
and brighter smoke jets out of the top accompanied by a
powerful beam of white light

The music abruptly stops and all the lights go out except
the bar lights In the middle of the smoke Moira gathers
her clothes up eagerly applauded by the spectators She
heads for the narrow backstage where Morgane another
girl wearing a Vampirella-style vinyl outfit is getting
ready to dance to the next track

22 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(BACKSTAGE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT)

Moira puts her G-string back on fixes her clothes and
takes her wig off Mario bursts in looking very serious
Mario - Moira I gotta talk to you

Moira turns round Charlie is right behind Mario Moira
is surprised by the tone of his voice

Moira - Whats up

Mario falters Charlie steps forward

Charlie - You dont know

Moira - No What

Charlie - Your brother” Oscar

“my
They are both avoiding her gaze Moira is getting
impatient

Charlie - Hes dead

My vision flickers A black flash Followed by terrifying

sounds

23 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR BAR NIGHT)

Abrupt return to the Here or There Seen from above
the police officers cross the main room carrying my
body on a stretcher My body is covered with the blood-
stained tablecloth Only my hands and my feet stick out
Black flash again

22 cont - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR NIGHTCLUB NIGHT)

And Charlies voice brings me back to the nightclub
Charlie - The cops did it They came with a friend of
your brothers called Victor They caught him yesterday
with some E And I think he grassed on your brother In
any case

Moira - What But how do you know

Mario - He works at the bar where it happened

Moira - But it it doesnt make sense

Charlie - In any case they laid a trap for him he
locked himself in the toilets and as he was armed they
shot at him

Moira - What

Moira looks at him uncomprehendingly

Moira (curtly) - What the hell are you talking about
Charlie is at a loss for words They stand there in silence
for a moment Moira spins round and runs up the
staircase Mario follows her and catches up with her in
the corridor He tries to soothe her but Moira beside
herself pushes him away

Moira - Wait for me downstairs OK

At a loss Mario doesnt move
Mario - Are you sure

Moira nods and walks over to the door of her dressing
room She turns to face Mario

Moira (with a jerky voice) - Yeah Ill come down

She takes her key opens the door and disappears inside
Mario hears her bolting the door inside He hesitates
then turns round to go back down

My vision goes through the wall

24 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM NIGHT)

And emerges up near the ceiling in the dressing room
Moira is leaning against the door staring blankly into
space

Moira - dont believe it its not true

In the purplish half-light Alex watches her as though
waiting for something else to happen But nothing does
On the other side of the wall we hear Mario going down
the stairs Moira seems to be having trouble breathing
Moira - Some guy says hes dead

Alex - What

Moira - Yes a

Moiras face trembles as though she were trying to hold
back her tears Alex stares at her He walks over

Moira (very softly) - hes dead

She bursts into tears Alex holds her squeezing her
tighter and tighter He cannot console her so he strokes
her hair and stifles his own tears

Alex - Oh no no

Moira huddles against him as he puts his arms around
her

Moira - Its not true is it

Still up by the ceiling my vision moves laterally into the
middle of the room At the same time it goes through
light variations that follow a rhythm like a heart-beat
Alex covers Moiras lips in kisses to stop her talking My
sister hugs him tighter and rubs up against him After a
while their body rhythm gets more sexual Alex reaches

ned
down unbuttons his pants and sliding my sisters panties
easily to one side enters her

I am drawn towards them

For the sake of convenience they slide down to the floor

where still wearing their clothes they start tenderly

making love

The lighting in the room gradually gets more purple along
the walls and more orange in the middle

I come closer to the two of them

Alex is kissing Moira passionately Still crying she
buries her head in his neck She bites him gently as
though to stifle her trembling mouth and heavy breathing
Moira - Tell me he isnt dead

I try to show my presence again But I am powerless
Once again my vision goes through everything I try to
touch including the flesh of their two bodies My vision
then settles again but everything seems slightly double
and a kind of halo has formed around their bodies An
orange glow seeping out from between their bodies turns
to yellow and starts to pulsate Repulsive organic and
liquid sounds flood over me A kind of barely perceptible
transparent and totally hazy ecioplasm materializes from
the top of the room It descends spasmodically towards
them and seems to want to slide like an umbilical tentacle
between Alexs legs towards the vagina of my sister
whose eyes now seem to be looking at me This beautiful
and slightly organic image disturbs me My vision backs
off nervously while a kind of light-colored substance
seems to flow through the ectoplasm towards my sisters
body

Suddenly a sharp sound screeches out louder and
louder and my vision pans I discover the high-pitched
buzzing is coming from the naked light bulb of a lamp
standing right next to me which is giving off an
increasingly harsh bright white light

IA
25 - WHITE LIGHT
(CLEAR SECONDARY LIGHT)

The buzzing gets louder and becomes a deafening
tumble The white light invades my whole being while
the rumbling shatters into a multitude of crystal-clear
sounds

Whiteness Nothing but white And finally a feeling of
oceanic peace Yet this time the sounds and the light
arent as pure and intense as the last white light I saw

A few seconds later a ‘murmur of human voices surges
out of this void I recognize my sisters voice among
them

Moira - Stay

My vision pans round and I can vaguely make out the
image of their two writhing bodies through the virtually
blinding light Then the calmness is broken by the noise
of their passion The light shifts to yellow and the
features of the dressing room gradually reappear from the
sides of my vision

24 cont - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM NIGHT)

Theluminous yellow throbbing is now calmer and the
silhouettes of Moira and Alex reappear more sharply in
the center of my field of vision Half-undressed on the
floor their tender love-making is coming to an end
Alexs movements slow down Moira holds him back so
that he wont withdraw

Moira - Stay

My perception is still doubled in places around the two of
them creating a half-halo half after-image effect As for
the strange transparent ectoplasmic presence it seems to
be being absorbed back into them

I move gently above them The heartbeat of the light
disappears at the same time as the after-image effect I
float down towards the couple In the midst of their tears
they are kissing much more peacefully

Footsteps approach in the corridor Alex covers Moiras
mouth to smother the noise of her breathing They both
freeze Someone knocks on the door Its Mario again
Mario (OS) - Moira Are you alright Let me in
» The police are here they want to talk to you

Moira sits up Alex does the same obviously panicked
Moira - Yeah Im OK Wait for me downstairs
Mario Ill be right down

Mario (OS) - Do you need anything

Moira - No Thank you Wait for me downstairs
Mario presses up against the door

Mario (OS) - Moira I love you

Moira cannot suppress an awkward look before sadness
washes over her face again

Moira - Ill be right with you

Marios footsteps disappear off

After a last tender touch Alex and Moira get up and fix
their clothes in silence

Alex - Who told you hes dead

Moira - A guy who was at the bar

Alex - They killed him in the bar

Moira shrugs her shoulders Alex looks out of the
window crushed

Moira takes her outfit off and slips her yellow dress on
Alex - Maybe hes wrong maybe hes only wounded
Moira shrugs her shoulders and finishes dressing

Moira - dont know Im off

She looks down Alex too

Then they look up at each other but no longer dare kiss
Moira looks distant

Alex starts to get edgy

Moira - What are you going to do

Alex - Right now Im gonna hide out Theyve got my
ID

Alex doesnt know what to say They pace round the
room Moira watches him anxiously

Alex - Ive got to go

Moira - Take care of yourself

Alex goes over to the fire exit

Alex - See you soon

He opens the door and checks no-one is outside Not
knowing how to say goodbye to Moira he disappears
down the stairs My sister watches him go then closes
the door She leans against the makeup table I go up to
her face She looks up and stares straight ahead

Moira (very softly to herself) - Oscar You cant leave
me

Then she lowers her eyes helpless

Moira - You cant just die like that You promised
me

Following these words my vision flickers around my
sister who is unconsciously rubbing her thumbs together

In a flash I see two childrens thumbs slit open and
bonding their blood

Moira looks up again and wraps her arms around her
chest

A gust of wind she cannot feel shoots through the room
Then while I am desperately trying to make her feel my
presence by swirling around her Moira starts sobbing
painfully again

The-image of my sister in tears blurs and turns into an
image of her as a child while other silhouettes form
around her

26 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT)

Translucent bodies gradually take shape in the room
bathed in an indeterminate white diffuse light It is
neither day nor night nor interior nor exterior The
silhouettes float motionless like in a state of
weightlessness some tilted but most of them horizontal
It soon becomes clear that they are not ghosts but the
faces and figures of multiple memories resurfacing in my
mind °

—
One of these vision seems clearer than the others It is the
vision of a couple in their thirties looking at me with
peaceful smiles like they can see me Their smiles fill
me with joy and peacefulness

‘ The woman - Oscar

Me (OS) - Mom Dad

then other images of my parents invade the space I am in
They superimpose each other or drive each other away at
great speed

These are the fragments of my past appearing in chaotic
disorder

What remained of the dressing room disappears

27 - SERIES OF FLASHBACKS
(VARIOUS PLACES AND TIMES)

Other memories flash nervously by forming a rapid

disorganized reflection of what my short life had been
My youth my childhood my birth and my death flash
past in no chronological order interwoven with semi-
abstract images (landscapes houses clouds flowers
reflections in water unknown faces etc)

The first images are very short almost subliminal

Age 3 I hold my newborn kid sister Moira in my arms
1 am at the beach with my parents on a rainy afternoon A
fabulous rainbow stretches overhead

¢ Later I am lying on a bed sick and my mother gives
me something to eat

¢ Age 3 J rub myself against a damp towel hanging in a
sunny laundry room

° Age 6 with two friends I sniff a pair of womens
panties

¢ Moira grown-up gets undressed i in front of me

« Age 6 I unfold the photo of a woman wearing a wet
bikini coming out of the sea

My mother undressing in the bathroom

¢ Around 5 I am in my bath with little Moira We are
laughing and looking at my father who is taking a picture
of us

¢ My parents arguing

Me hitting a boy at the orphanage

¢ Victor trying to hit me

Victors mother a beautiful woman much older than
me kisses me on the mouth

Directors note During these memories the POV of Oscars vision
will not quite be a subjective vision any more rather a kind of
synthesised mental reconstruction of the past In this part of the movie
more classically shot and more broken down Oscars vision will stand
slightly back from his body which we will often see in the foreground

with his back turned or 34 turned to us but rarely facing us Moreover

the outline of his body will often be dark and undefined during these
memories

¢ Me as a child sleeping in the same bed as Moira

¢ Age 20 kissing beautiful Moira in front of a bus

¢ As a child tickling little Moira trapped between my
knees

’ e Moira smiling at Mario

¢ Me walking down the street with Mario towards the bar
¢ Victor waiting for me at the bar and giving me a
worried look

Age 2 rolling between my parents in their bed while
my mother breast-feeds baby Moira

¢ Me as a baby sucking at my mothers huge breast

¢ Age 12 swimming underwater in a public swimming
pool

¢ My father holds me up in the air and spins round and
round I ain 3

Age 6 clutching my mother who is stroking me and my
little sister while my father packs bags into the trunk in
the background

28 - FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR CHILDHOOD HOME DAY)

The rhythm of my memories finally slows down on this
last scene that took place in the mid 80s

My-mother is comforting Moira and me while my father
puts the last bag in the trunk

Me (to my mother) - Will your plane fly real high

My mother - Yes way above the clouds Its very
beautiful

I cling tighter to my mother

My mother - Dont worry the week will fly by And
daddy will take good care of you

We get in the car my parents in the front and us in back
My mother turns round to tell us to fasten our seat belts

(EXTERIOR ROAD INTERIOR TUNNEL DAY)

’ My mother - Watch out

A few minutes later my parents car is driving towards
the entrance of a narrow tunnel A red light is on above
it My father doesnt seem to have noticed it and drives in
all the same

Suddenly a truck arriving in the opposite direction
appears heading straight for us The white headlights fill
the whole screen The sound of a horn and screeching
brakes rings out

30 - FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR BUILDING AND TUNNEL ROAD DAY)

The white clears away Moira and I are on the side of the
road in front of a building beside the entrance to the
tunnel We are looking at a fireman who walks over
awkwardly and crouches down in front of us

Fireman - Your parents theyre

Still in shock we look at him without understanding The
fireman is increasingly ill at ease

Fireman - I mean they wont be coming back

Some way behind him in the midst of the emergency
services coming and going and the crowd of onlookers
ambulance men are carrying two covered bodies on
stretchers to a waiting ambulance

The scrunch of metal slamming into metal the screech of
brakes and the shattering of glass fills the air

29 cont - FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR ROAD TUNNEL DAY)

The truck rams my parents car into a wall at the entrance
to the tunnel The windscreen shatters to smithereens
The inside of the car is splattered with blood and shards
of glass In an ultimate reflex reaction crouch over my
sister and protect her with my body

31 - FLASHBACK
(INTERIOR AUNTS APARTMENT DAY)

The sounds of the accident disappear

» A lovely photo of my parents with flowers around them is

displayed on the telephone cable

My aunt (OS) You know wed really like to be able to
keep you both Oscar

I turn to look at my aunt who is very seriously explaining
her worries to me I am sitting with little 4-year-old
Moira on one of the two camp beds that are cluttering up
a very modest living room A few toys lie beside us
Sitting nearby little 2-year-old Tito looks dumbly at us
My aunt - But it its impossible

As I dont say anything my aunt adds awkwardly

My aunt - One day youll understand what money is
Money decides everything

Moira and I look at her in silence

32 - FLASHBACK

A few days later sitting in the darkness of my parents’

Suitcases aiid boxes are piled around us

Moira - We wont see each other any more

My sisters lips droop sadly

I want to say something else but I swallow my words I
fix the razor blade I am holding then turn to Moira

Me - I promise well never leave each other

33 - FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR PARK LATE AFTERNOON)

Moira and I grown-up are lying on our backs on the-

grassy slope of a large park scattered with autumn leaves

The sun is hot behind the trees Moira is wearing her
golden yellow dress

Me - Do you remember the promise we made after mom
and dad died

Moira - Kind of

Moira half-shuts her eyes pensively searching for the
memory

Me - But it was a blood pact (I giggle) You sure you
dont remember

She doesnt reply but inspects her thumb

Moira - Umm

32 cont - FLASHBACK
(INTERIOR PARENTS APARTMENT NIGHT)

Back to the promise with my little sister

Moira - Youll never ever leave me

Me - Never

I take my sisters hand and hold the razor blade up to it
Moira is frightened and pulls her arm away

Me - You have to This is how pacts are made

I squeeze her hand tight and cut a small nick in her
thumb Then I cut mine and we bond our two thumbs
together Blood trickles down our hands Moira goes
pale impressed The sight of blood makes her groan We
look at each other dizzily

34 - FLASHBACK
(CORRIDOR ORPHANAGE MORNING)

A few days later I am hugging a tearful little Moira I
give her a big kiss and stroke her hair to soothe her

A man (OS) - Come on now time to go

I reluctantly break away from my sister and pick up a
small suitcase We are in a large gray corridor near the
open door of the directors office Uncle and aunt are
there looking at us My aunt wipes the tears from her
eyes and picks Moira up My uncle awkwardly places his
hand on my shoulder

ah Of

rote

Uncle - Arent you going to say goodbye
I break away from him without a word and without a
glance Then I wave softly at my sister

Me - Dont worry Moira
‘ I go over to the man in the gray uniform who is waiting

for me and walk off down the corridor with him
Moira tries td wriggle out of my aunts arms and calls out
to me

35 - FLASHBACK
(ORPHANAGE CORRIDOR AND YARD MORNING)

At the other end of the corridor the supervisor opens a
door and we walk out into a large inner yard The
supervisor points to the wing opposite

Supervisor - And the dormitories are up there

A little way away a group of boys throw us scornful
looks and whisper among themselves

36 - FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR ORPHANAGE YARD DAY)

A few years later in the courtyard a small group of boys
wearing gym kits and aged around 10 like me come
over

One of them a boy a head taller than the others wearing
glasses addresses me confidentially The other kids are
already laughing

Boy - Say wasnt your mothers name Elsa

I warily calculate my reply

Me - Uh huh Why

Boy - I knew her real well you know well no I
mean My father and a friend of his knew her real
well She was good huh a real horny bitch
Apparently she used to make love like dogs on all

fours

The boy leans over and thrusts his hips to and fro in an
obscene gesture The other boys are laughing their heads
off My lips quiver And my fist punches the boy with”
the glasses right in the nose He was hoping I would do
that He grabs me by the neck and pushes me up against
the wall Then he knees me in the stomach several
times

Boy - Dont ever do that again you sonofabitch

The other kids form a tight ring around us and watch me
having my head bashed in with great interest

(LANDING STAIRS BRUNOS BUILDING NIGHT)

Bruno a real nice guy my age shakes hands with Alex
and me

Bruno - So call me next week for the E

I nod and he shuts the door Alex stashes a package away
in his jacket We go down the stairs

Me - Lets have a look

Alex motions to me to be discreet

Me - Did you get a good deal

an

Alex - Yup And its that new Amsterdam pot they grow
in labs Its four times stronger than the other stuff
Alex takes a ready-rolled joint out of his pocket and

hands it to me I get my lighter out light the joint and
take two drags

57 - FLASHBACK

Alex and I leave the harsh gray building and walk along a
deserted street lined with disused factories We pass the
joint as we go Alex turns round from time to time to
check were not being followed

58 - FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR BY CANAL NIGHT)

A different night We are dressed differently and leaning
against the parapet of a quay opposite a small canal

Me - God this stuff really is strong I never really
understood how a few drags of broken leaves could blow
your mind open like this

Alex - I dunno Its some kinda electro-chemical thing
going on between the neurons But drugs arent the only
thing that can do that you know Apparently when you
have an accident your brain can secrete enough adrenalin
to make you disconnect in a few seconds You feel like
youve gone out of your body and youre going back over
your whole life

Me (fascinated) - Oh yeah

Alex cant find the words any more Were totally out of
it Our eyes are red and our movements are getting more
and more shaky

Alex - Yeah But the most mind-blowing thing Ive
tried up to now is DMT and acid The problem is that
stuff really fries your brain

A long pensive silence follows while Alex and I look at
the surface of the canal in front of us Further off the

canal disappears under a brick archway Down the street

mT

co

the silhouette of an old man carrying plastic bags goes
by Alex motions in that direction

Alex - See that arch Thats where you go into the
underworld

Me - Oh yeah And how do you know there are people

living in there

Alex - Everyone knows it Theyre bums or illegal
workers At least they can hide out in there Apparently
you get whole families down there

Me - Have you been inside

Alex - Nah not yet

Me - It must be a nightmare

We look at the canal again And lose ourselves in deep
thought

59 - FLASHBACK
(INTERIOR BAR NIGHT)

Later the same night Alex and I are drinking beer at a
table at the Here or There A TV set is on above the
counter A sensationalist documentary on the chemistry of
the brain and brain cells is on We see endoscopic shots
of the inside of a human brain It looks like a maze of
tunnels full of floating purpley-gray filaments
Stillstoned we are watching it attentively our mouths
hanging open a bit too much The owner stares at us with
an I aint stupid look on his face He whispers
something to a customer at the bar Alex notices and
leans over to me with an unnecessarily dramatic look
Alex - Do you feel the bad vibes here

Me - No

painting hes doing Alex says to me

Alex - Say seeing as youre interested in altered states of
consciousness

Alex is looking for something on a bookshelf

Alex - you should read this

Its The Tibetan Book of the Dead I look at the pretty
mandala printed on the cover

Me - What is it

Alex - It tells you about whats waiting for you when you
die

Me - What do you mean

Alex - When you die your spirit leaves your body and
starts flying around The weird thing is that some
people say theyve experienced the same thing by doing
breathing exercises They call it an out-of-body
projection I tried it once

Me - What did you do

Alex - Well you have to slow your breathing down
You start off breathing in for five seconds you keep the
air inside you five seconds you breathe out for five
seconds and then you keep your lungs empty for five
seconds Then you slow down progressively to six
seconds then seven eight You end up breathing once
every two minutes or less even Ill lend you a special
cassette Ive got

In the club in the middle of the jam-packed dance floor
Moira is going for it dancing quite lewdly in a
bodystocking and super-clingy hot-pants Moving in
rhythm to the music she slides her hands up her long
supple thighs and up to her breasts caressing them and
simulating a state of trance before lifting her arms up to
the ceiling Her mouth parts open and carefree happiness
is written all over her face There are guys around her
who cannot take their eyes off her Further off Tito is
rubbing up against Nelly a fresh-faced spontaneous 15
year-old girl The atmosphere is pretty robotic fashion
and homo
Alex and I are sitting on a chair by the dance floor
watching my sisters dance in amusement oT
Alex - Shes on something isnt she

70 - FLASHBACK
rs (INTERIOR STUDIO DAY)

I am looking at a photo of my parents that I had slipped
inside The Tibetan Book of the Dead Feeling Moira
watching me I tuck the photo back inside the book and
look at her Its daytime We are sitting at the table in my
studio

Me - Listen to this

I read her the summary on the back cover of the book
Moira is wearing a small pair of panties and a sweater
She goes back to making a sandwich and turns the spacey
music on the radio down

Me (with conviction) - In the first days following

death the dead persons ‘spirit still believes it is among

the living It flies around them and tries to communicate

a)
but the living can no longer feel its presence Then a first
dazzling light appears to the spirit It is a pathway to a
higher plane where the spirit will finally be able to merge

into the void But most often the spirit backs off
’ frightened In the next few days other lights appear each

time a different color But they are already weaker and
less beautiful The spirit clings on to the world of the
living and refuses to let the lights carry it off to higher
planes Finally the lights disappear and the deceaseds
visions become moré and more harrowing For a long
time the disembodied ‘solitary spirit cannot find peace
anywhere Then one day the yellow glows appear These
are the last doors that will bring the dead person back to
the world of the living He sees couples making love
inside the glows He approaches them closer each time
He finally visualizes a future life and slips into the womb
he has chosen

I look at Moira who obviously hasnt followed any of
this

Moira - You havent joined a sect I hope

Me - Of course I havent Its

Moira - Because whether they’ Te Christians Buddhists or
Scientologists ‘they re all just as bad as each other Its
incredible how much bullshit theyll dream up to take
your money off you and make you follow them like
sheep

Me - Yes I know But this is completely different
Moira - Oh wake up Were at the dawn of the year
2000 And its about time all that stuff stopped

I shut up and put the book back down annoyed

Shewalks right by me and I cant help gazing at her butt
Unlike his father Victor notices my gaze And I sense
his An awkward silence reigns for a few moments Then
I get up a little hastily and clumsily gather up the bottles
on the table before vanishing into the kitchen

I set the bottles down near the fridge and go over to Suzy
who is rinsing the plates I stroke her arm

Me - Suzy

Suzy is very embarrassed She pushes me away

Suzy (low whisper) - Not here

I put the bag down in front of Victor who is digging in
his pocket to pay me I pocket the bills then take a huge
joint out of a small box I light it and hand it to Victor

to me Then he points at the bag of pills

take them all Just five or six You can give me the rest

Victor - Youre lower than a piece of shit

He dashes over to hit me But Im stronger than he is and
I manage to retain him and pin him to the ground Victor
starts weeping his hatred The tears spurt out of his eyes
At the same time his cracked lips start pissing blood

Moira looks at me in surprise

Moira - Why do you say that

Me - I dont know Its good to explain things sometimes

other

Half an hour later Im leaning over the balcony finishing a
cigarette
The mental reconstruction of this moment in the past is

no longer seen from the same angle at which I really”

lived it Moreover the decor and the actions have
become simplified

Moira comes over and leans against the wooden railing
hext to me

We look out at the evening sky Above the towers in the
distance the little airplane scuds across the sky It rises
silently up towards the orange-tinted clouds A fluffy
white line trails out behind it

me - Do you like flying

Moira (OS) - No

me - Why not

I wait for her reply

Moira (OS) - Im scared

The plane disappears into a cloud I look at Moira who is
staring blankly out into space

Me - Scared of what

Moira turns round and goes back inside

(INTERIOR STUDIO DUSK)

I follow her in She gathers up some things puts them
into her bag and heads for the door

Moira - See you later

Sheturns round in the doorway We smile at each other
Suddenly all the sounds disappear

I look at my sister in absolute silence She is looking
back at me

The sounds resurface I snap to and look away

Me - See you soon

The door closes behind Moira

I sit down on the bed and look for a stub of a joint I light
it

I lie down and smoke it while staring at the ceiling

A few seconds later I stub the filter out in the ashtray
My hand gropes for the light switch on the wall and flicks
it off The light goes out I close my eyes

does the whole room This phenomenon is accompanied
by a loud whistle I step back towards the door but it has
disappeared now replaced by a smooth wall
A phone rings The dream dissolves

96 - FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR STREETS NIGHT)

Alex and I are walking down the street heading for the
’ “Here or There

As we walk the dialogs decor and position of objects
seem to charige more and more in relation to my initial
perception

Alex - I read something youd like today Two friends
make a promise the one who dies first will come back
and tell the other what happens after you die

We turn the corner A big concrete wall looms up at the
end of the street

Me - But I dont get it Whats the moral of your story
Alex - Well theres no moral It’s just that

Alex takes a pack of cigarettes out his pocket But its
empty Disappointed he chucks it on the ground

Alex - You cant keep promises like that

97 - FLASHBACK
(INTERIOR BAR NIGHT)

Victor is waiting for me inside the bar very agitated I sit
down opposite him
Victor - Forgive me

He looks over to the entrance I turn round The two
plain clothes cops stare at me I instinctively get up

98 - FLASHBACK
(INTERIOR TOILET CUBICLE NIGHT)

I lock myself into the toilet

I nervously take the bag out of my pocket and throw it
into the toilet I pull the chain but it leaks and isnt
powerful enough to flush the bag away The police are
trying to break the door down I hear other men running
over to help and shouting warnings Im going crazy with
this bag still floating there The little window opposite

me is too narrow The police are kicking the door and Im’

losing all control I block the door with my foot and
cot
on

eon

desperately yank the chain A gunshot rings out on the
other side of the door

Suddenly everything seem to slow down to a complete
’ Stop

As though stopping time my vision follows the bullets
path backwards towards the gun then up towards the
policemans face then past the faces of his colleagues
watching then through the bar up to Victors face
looking at the door to the bathroom in terror then off
towards the owner and finally to Charlie behind the
counter who puts a bottle down

Time then starts up again but two minutes earlier before
the bullet was fired From now on the sounds and the
passing of time take on a purely emotional logic and I
clearly perceive the feelings of each and every
protagonist

From Charlies POV I see myself dashing over to the
bathroom followed by the policemen And I see Victor
put his head in his hands and try to get up before a police
officer makes him sit straight back down

Finally I see the owner coming over to the toilets to see
whats going on while the police shout in all directions
Myvision follows the owners POV But he stops when
he sees one of the policemen banging on the door

My vision zips over to the three policemen and takes on
the POV of one of them while I hear my own voice
ringing out from behind the door

Me (OS) - Watch out or Ill shoot

I see the stunned surprise of the police who quickly move
away from the door and make signs to each other

One of the police officers (whispering) - Watch it he
may be tripping

The officer whose POV Ive adopted then sees one of
them taking his gun out while the third nods but motions
to him to wait

I hear me shouting threats through the door a second

time

—

The third officer then signals to the one with the gun to
aim it at the lock He does so Then he signals to him to
fire and just as he pulls the trigger my vision rushes

towards the gun Time slows down again and my vision

accompanies the bullet exploding out of the barrel
through the lock and straight into my chest BANG The
bullet bursts out of my body and time and my memory go
back to normal

I double up clutching my torn chest

The police push on the door and I fall to my knees on the
slab The door finally bursts open And I collapse with
my head on the edge of the hole

The white enamel is splattered with scale stains A trickle
of blood rolls along the surface and into the hole The
broken flushing system spurts out dribbling water It wets
the trainers of the police officer groping me down and
shaking my head

Im lying on the ground in the fetal position on my right
side My right arm dangles over the hole My sleeves are
getting drenched in blood My eyes stare wide open
towards my hand The soft trickling of the toilet flush

gives the situationa falsely calm air I suddenly cough

blood onto the slab and my arm I try to raise my hand
but it is not responding only one finger moves
imperceptibly

The sounds go muffled

After a few final efforts my breathing stops and my eyes
stop moving at the same time as my body

I am no longer breathing

The seconds tick silently by

This final vision zooms backwaids like its plummeting
into a pit

99 - TUNNEL OF MEMORIES
(COMPLEX HALLUCINATORY VISION)

Around this central image other various images of my

life gradually line up side by side forming a kind of

latticework tunnel lined with multiple obscure memories
Hundreds of images voices and sounds circulate and
drown each other out

A muffled sound draws near

A black light appears’ in the middle of this complex
twisting tunnel and swallows all the images up like a
bottomless pit
The muffled sound explodes Black flash

TR
100 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR TOILET STALL NIGHT)

The nature of the black pit changes Calm returns along
with a very reassuring liquid sound The images have all
gone and the walls of the tunnel turn blue white and red
The slab of the toilet gradually re-forms again from the
sides sloping at ground level just the way I saw it when I
died

The hole is in the middle but the bag of pills has
disappeared My arm isnt there any more either And
there are hardly any traces of blood left either A hand
suddenly appears scrubbing the slab with a brush At the
same time my vision swoops up to the ceiling next to
the light bulb

Down below a young policeman is scrubbing the last
bloodstains away He puts the scrubbing brush in a
bucket and pulls the chain The noise gurgles out and a
flash of light invades the room

When the flash fades the policeman has disappeared and
my body is lying there again in the fetal position on the
bloody slab

Another flash and its gone

The young policeman stands up in the stall and looks out
the open door A familiar voice rings out in the next-door
room

Bar owner (OS) - Well

On hearing this voice my vision flickers and is violently
propelled backwards through the wall

101 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR BAR NIGHT)

I am above the counter in the empty bar again Charlie
has just come in He goe§ over to his boss

aN
Charlie - Ive told his sister

The image of the two men and the bar is torn away from
me as though I was moving backwards then flying
rapidly through shafts of light like the streets of a city at
night

102 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM NIGHT)

I find myself in Moira’s dressing room where Morgane
still in her Vampirella get-up is with the owner of the
club

She smokes a cigarette while gathering my sisters
belongings together

Owner - And where is she now

Morgane - Poor thing shes gone to identify the body

The image of the dressing room is whisked away and I
speed through the walls and the streets of the city at
night

103 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR MORGUE NIGHT)

It took less than a second My vision settles in an
unknown place and I finally discover my own body
motionless and bloodless just as a hand is lifting up the
sheet covering it

A police officer (OS) - Is this your brother

Two undercover cops and a morgue worker are asking
Moira to identify my corpse which is lying on a metal
trolley in the morgue room

My sister purses her lips approaches the body and looks
at it fora few seconds She nods in assent then takes two
steps back and huddles into Marios arms He holds her
tight hiding her face between his arms

Mario (to the police) - Are you done

Police officer - Yes Thats fine Were done

Rn
oes

Mario leads Moira to the exit The officer then turns to
the morgue worker and nods at him

I float up to my face which looks repulsively waxy and
stiff

Police officer (OS) - You can take him away

Wheels squeak and I accompany the worker pushing my
body away ‘on the trolley I am increasingly drawn
towards my eyes

I end up glued to the immobile iris of my right eye

All sounds go dim like at the end of a dream

A few seconds pass in Silence

Then the noise of a metal door opening booms out
immediately accompanied by a deafening crackling that
sounds like a furnace The glassy surface of my eye
reflects very bright spots of light

These spots start swirling inside my iris multiplying and
filling the space with a powerful uniform blue light This
electric blue gets stronger and becomes positively
dazzling My consciousness seems to fade into this
monochrome light

104 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR STUDIO DAY)

The noise of a whistling suction seems to want to carry
me off to an unknown world But this noise is too
worrying And a white blotch growing bigger and bigger
covers the blue background while the whistling noise
finally disappears

All of a sudden my vision is swept backwards emerging
from a shiny white reflection on the surface of a strange
metallic vase sitting on a shelf

My vision is now floating in my studio

Its the afternoon Moira Tito my uncle and my aunt are
there They are sitting at the table in front of empty
coffee cups

Rl

-
Moira - In any case the assholes made sure thered be no
autopsy

Tito - But where on earth would Oscar have found a
gun Its a load of bull

“ Uncle - But the bar owner signed a statement saying he
saw his gun

Tito - Like fell Alex and Victor are the only ones that
know what happened But Alex is on the run and fucking
Victor would say anything to get out of jail

Uncle - Perhaps youre right But unfortunately theres no
denying he had the bag of drugs Anyway its no use
attacking the police theyre stronger than we are
Moira who was standing moves away from my uncle
unwilling to pursue the conversation My aunt turns to
her son

Aunt - And will they be letting Victor go

Tito - Yeah I think so Next week

My uncle and Tito get up to go

Aunt (in a whisper) - What a ghastly story

Moira looks at her in contempt

Tito and his parents go over to the door

I go through the wall and whoosh through several houses
in the town in a split second

105 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR PRISON CELL DAY)

I find myscif inside a prison cell Seen from above a
guard is standing in front of the open door He motions to
Victor

Guard - Cmon little baby Your mommys here to see
you

Victors cellmates laugh knowingly Victor walks out
fearfully with his head down

I let myself slip through the wall My vision takes a split
second to travel through the building to the visitors
room

106 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR PRISON VISITORS ROOM DAY)

I find myself above Suzy who is with a lawyer waiting

’ for her son behind a glass partition

Lawyer - Listen I know its an awful thing to say but if
your son agrees to cooperate with them they should let
him go

Crushed Suzy doesnt know how to answer

Lawyer - As for the one that ran away hes running a
big risk I imagine theyve already tapped Titos and
Moiras phones

My vision leaves the room and crosses the city in an
instant

107 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR STUDIO DAY)

Ending up in my studio Its the end of another day
Moira is sitting on the white sheet on my bed talking on
the phone

Moira - Thanks Mario but Im doing fine see you
tomorrow

She hangs up and starts sorting through my final
belongings and packing them into bags and boxes
Morgane is there helping her There is barely a single
trace of my existence left in the room But there is a huge
photo of me pinned to the wall above what used to be my
bed Moira must have put it up after my death

Moira picks up The Tibetan Book of the Dead but
instead of packing it away she starts reading the back
cover When she’s through she looks up and her eyes
calm at last stare into the void A feeling of peace seeps
through me as well

White spots of light start swirling over the white book
cover and they multiply covering my vision with a
powerful white uniform light The light gets stronger and
becomes dazzling

RR
108 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR UNDERWORLD HALF-LIGHT)

The suction seem to want to take me to an unknown
world But the whooshing noise is too worrying and I
back away while a smoky gray glow rapidly stains one
edge of thisperfect white Its the detail of an image
stretching rapidly over the white background The
whooshing suction noise finally disappears

I discover a place that looks like a cellar with damp gray
walls lit by a paltry candle Next to the candle is Alex
curled up in a ball shivering with cold His nose is
running In front of the candle lies a fork and two empty
cans of food

My vision rises up through the ceiling comes out near
the canal and instantly speeds through the town

109 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR LOFT RAINY DAY)

to Tito and Alexs loft Alexs things are scattered
around the room amongst Titos stuff The loft is empty
but I can hear voices The front door is open Three
uniformed police officers are talking to Tito in the
doorway

Police officer - Dont forget if he contacts you and you
dont let us know then you will be charged as a drug
dealers accomplice and an accessory to an assault on a
police officer Did you know the officer in question is
now paralyzed

Tito nods humbly

The police officers say goodbye coldly and leave Tito
closes the door behind them He looks worried

I go through the wall again and cross the town

110 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR CANAL RAINY DAY)

to a Street where Alexis walking up to a phone booth
shivering He goes inside
The canal and the entrance to the underworld are on the
other side of the street A few homeless-bum type guys
are huddled near the archway watching the rain Bottles
lie at their feet

Alex dials a number in the phone booth

We hear the line ringing through the receiver

111 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR STUDIO BATHROOM DAY)

The phone is ringing in my deserted studio Nobody
answers Sounds of water reach me from the bathroom I
pass through the door

into the bathroom where Moira is taking a shower
She can hear the phone ringing but doesnt want to get out
the shower She leans her head back opens her mouth
and swallows some shower spray

As shes soaping herself down she slips a finger into her
vagina and inspects it anxiously

Moira turns the shower tap off and steps out the tub Her
golden yellow dress is lying on the bidet Light streams
in from the skylight onto the yellow cloth

Moira sits on the edge of the bathtub

Yellow spots of light appear and start swirling around the
dress They gradually invade my vision accompanied by
a prolonged whistling

The color gets stronger and becomes dazzling

112 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR LABORATORY DAY)

Once again the suction seems to want to carry me away
But that sound is still just as worrying and I draw back
while a darker yellow and blue blotch looms up in the
middle of the light and starts to spread Its a detail of
some floor tiling The suction noise finally disappears
and I find myself in a new setting

Moira is crouched inside a cubicle peeing into a glass
container She pulls her panties up and fixes her skirt
She pulls a curtain back and walks back out into a small
laboratory She holds the container out to a young woman
in a white coat who js sitting behind a desk

Nurse - The results will be ready in two days

eat in silence The apartment is small A sorry ceiling
light hangs above them My aunt looks at Moira

Aunt - You really dont have any luck First your

Opposite Moira and my aunt my uncle inspects his meat

Moira - No I dont think so

The doctor looks at Moiras red sweater for a moment
Doctor - OK Ill fix you an appointment at the abortion

Red spots start swirling around her sweater gradually
covering my vision with an intense uniform light The
disturbing whistling sound reappears and tries to carry me
off The red gets stronger and becomes dazzling
116 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR CLINIC GRAY DAY)

But drab reddish glows stain this bright red light They
‘are the tiles of an orange-brown corridor The noise
finally disappears and everything becomes clear again

A few days have passed Moira and Tito are walking
down the corridor of a clinic where a nurse is listening to
a large radio set

Tito - Are you sure about your decision

Moira - Yes otherwise I wont be able to carry on
working

They walk on sadly

Moira - Still no news from Alex

Tito - No I know the cops are still looking for him
Moira - What do you think hed do if he were in my
shoes

Tito - I dont know Hes a bit erm Tell me

Moira - Anyway its nice of you to come with me

He ushers Moira into a small room furnished with a desk
a sink a pharmaceutical cabinet and an examination
table A trolley with medical and gynecological
instruments on it is set up next to the table Tito has
stayed outside

The doctor talks to Moira in a very fatherly manner

Doctor - You may take your clothes off and lie down on
the table
Moira nervously follows his directions she half-

undresses keeping her bra and white panties on And her
’ socks

The sounds of small children playing ball drift in through
the half-open window Moira looks over at it

The doctor then motions to her to sit on the table

While she does so he puts on a sterilized latex glove He
comes back to the examining table where Moira has now
taken off her panties He gives her a relaxed smile and
fixes the pillow under her head Moira does not smile
back

Doctor - Dont worry Im just going to examine you
before giving you the abortion pill As for the egg youll
go quietly home and if all goes well you should lose it
within the next couple of hours

(INTERIOR BATHROOM DAY)

and find myself in the small bathroom in my studio a
few hours later the same night Moira is clutching her
stomach and moaning She is sitting on the toilet She
stands up shakily but constantly doubles over in spasms
Her face is soaked with tears The toilet bowl is bathed in
blood A shapeless clot is floating in the water surely the
embryo
Tito knocks on the door but gets no answer

I go through the wall

120 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR STUDIO EVENING)

On the other side Tito has his ear pressed up against the
wooden bathroom door He can hear Moira crying

He knocks again The crying stops He stays pressed up
against the door -

He hears Moira come up to the door and press her ear to
it too

Tito - Are you okay

Moira (OS) - Hang on

He hears her breathing then stepping away The toilet
flushes The bolt slides back The handle turns The door
opens Moira comes out walks across the room and curls
up on her bed Tito follows her in the half-light and leans
over her she is pale and her eyes are wet

He sits down next to her and slips his arm around her
shoulders

Tito - Well

She tries to smile but sinks back into her depressive state
Moira - that was all I had

Tito hugs her and dries her cheek

Tito - You you can come to the loft as often as you
like That way you wont be alone

Moira looks into his eyes Tito looks down

Moira gives him a sisterly hug and shuts her eyes They
stay there without moving Moira seems to be falling
asleep on her cousins knees

121 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR LOFT DAY)

Tito - Thats my latest painting
Later that night Tito and Moira are in-Titos loft He

shows her a painting of a brightly colored landscape with -

three people walking under an apocalyptic but gleeful
storm

He turns back to Moira who doesnt know what to say
She looks away at a model sculpted out of stone

Tito - Alex did that model

Moira goes over to take a closer look Its a model of a
little house on a hill It is surround by crosses They look
like a derelict cemetery

Moira - Have you known him long I mean dont you
think hes a little bizarre

Tito - No We get on real well anyway Maybe ‘cos
we do the same thing

Moira - Are you going to be able to keep the loft
Tito - Why

Moira - Isnt it in his name

Tito - Well yes but

The door opens Nelly comes in as young fresh and
spontaneous as ever She seems surprised to see Moira
but comes over and gives her an affectionate kiss

Nelly (to Moira) - Did it go well

Nelly smiles then grimaces at her clumsy question
Moira looks her in the eye half blankly half cheered up
by her question

Moira - Yes

Tito looks at Moira Her eyes are heavy with sleep

Tito (to Moira) - You look beat Take the bed We can
sleep on the floor

Moira hesitates

Later that night Tito and Nelly are cuddling under a

green blanket on the floor They whisper things we

cannot hear

A few feet away Moira opens her eyes in the bed and
looks at them Nelly turns round and sees Moira They
look at each other in silence Moira closes her eyes

Green spots of light swirl around the blanket with a loud
whistling whooshing sound They invade my vision The
whooshing sound of a violent suction seems to want to
carry me off The green gets stronger and becomes
dazzling

123 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR NIGHTCLUB EVENING)

But a darker blotch spreads through the green light Its
the dark green of a pool table The image clears and the
whistling finally stops

My vision is now floating inside a nightclub Moira
comes out of small office with her boss who pats her
head They go into the main room The owner shakes her
hand

Owner - Dont worry Morgane can replace you

She is about to leave when Mario who had been talking
to another barman runs up to her

Mario - The boss told me you were sick

Moira - Im not sick but I need a rest

Mario - Why

Moira is silent for a seconds before adding softly

Moira - had an abortion But it wasnt yours It was
Alexs baby

Mario tenses but tries not to show his hatred in front of

his colleagues busy getting ready nearby He takes his

lighter out and furiously lights a cigarette
I go through the walls away from the Power

124 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR STREET PHONE BOOTH EVENING)

And find myself in a small deserted street next to a
phone booth Alex is inside talking anxiously to
someone

Alex - thought of you because I cant call any of my

Im in big big trouble Can I come see you

Alex listens to the person on the other end of the line
Alex - No Yes money too but thats not the
problem I have to leave the country No really its a
drug thing But Ill explain

bronchitis

125 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR LOFT NIGHT)

I come back to the loft where Moira Nelly Tito Max
and another guy are sitting on the floor amidst empty
plates and unmatched cutlery They are done eating and
all look like theyre bored Moira is the most mature of
them One of the guys is sprawled on the floor listening
to monotone music while Max looks at Titos paintings
He is holding a beer

Max (to Tito) - Have you ever taken microdots

Tito - No Have you

Max - Yes Youd like them Theyre like LSD except
you go twice as high and it lasts 18 hours instead of six
Theyre real small like pepper coms and theyre cheap
But theyre real hard to get hold of

He turns to Moira with a seductive smile and offers her a
glass of beer She refuses He insists feigning offense
But she refuses again

Tito (to Max) - Didnt you want to go to the rave

Max - Dyou wanna go

Tito - Nah Id rather stay here and paint

Max looks inquiringly at the girls Nelly seems to be in
two minds Moira doesnt want to go Max stands there
pensively

Silence ensues while the music comes to an end

” Max (to Tito) - Have you heard from Victor

Tito - No but hes out and I think hes pretty rough
Max - Yeahno kidding

Moira gets up annoyed Max shuts up Moira heads for
the kitchen

My vision speeds out the loft

Victor - Wont you You sad bastard She fucks all my

His father slaps him hard across the face then mumbles
an inaudible threat

Victor stifles his tears and leaves the room shouting
Victor - Fuck off and die both of you

the door behind him

My vision zooms back to the loft

Moira - Its gone
Nelly - What do you think of them

Moira - Maybeits because of Oscar but I cant stand
‘ guys who go about drugs any more

Moira motions minor disgust Nelly looks at her

Nelly - Come sit down

The two girls go sit on the bed

Nelly strokes Moiras back in a motherly fashion

Nelly - Its alright it’s over now

Moira smiles and Nelly leans down to listen to her heart
Moira puts her arm around Nelly and unbuttons her shirt
They look at each other tenderly Moira lies down
Opposite them a blurry-eyed Tito is developing his latest
painting He is adding loud colors pretty much
everywhere He tries to shut one eye to get a better
perspective on his brush but he cant Every time he tries
to close one eye the two of them close

Tito glances over at the bed And again

Unable to concentrate on his painting he yawns and sets
his brush down

He switches off the lights in the loft

The girls stop talking

He takes his shirt and pants off

He slips in between Nelly and Moira smiling

Little by little the three bodies curl around each other and
start to move

Their arms all lock passionately

Tito eases out of Nellys arms and snuggles into Moiras
She moans Nelly puts her mouth over Moiras

Later that night Nelly and Tito are sleeping peacefully
Their arms are clasped around Moira who is lying naked
between the two of them her eyes wide open

She is staring at the ceiling above the bed Then she tilts

her head and looks at the little stone house Alex made

a5
transfixed It looks very real The rays of the moon are
beaming down on it

Spots of five different colors swirl through my vision
éreating blue white yellow red and green patches of
light The whistling sound is there sucking me up again
The colors get stronger and become dazzling

realized the movie sucked but as I know Ill never see
another one I figure I may as well see it through maybe
‘ therell be a great scene at the end to justify the other
stuff know Im probably getting my hopes up for
nothing but thats all I need to stay alive

Tito - Jesus get her off

Nelly picks up a remote and zaps Then she gives Tito a
worried look

Nelly - Tito do you love her more than me

Tito laughs and sits down on the bed beside her in a
good mood again

Tito - Do you

Nelly smiles

Just then the first instrumental bars of a zippy pop video
ring out Psychedelic images appear Tito and Nelly hug
each other and stare at the TV

Various tinted spots start swirling around the screen
They gradually create a kind of concentric rainbow of
extremely pure light This fabulous rainbow fills my
vision And a whistling sound much gentler than the
previous ones seems to drift out of the middle of this
halo and want to suck me in

133 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR LOFT MORNING)

A dark blue light appears in the middle and spreads
bringing a new image that finally makes the rainbow and
the whistling disappear

The TV is now off in Titos loft where morning breaks
dark and blue

Moira is gathering up a few belongings and packing them
into a case Tito enters

Tito - At last Where were you We were worried
Tito looks at the case and plies for an answer

OR
Moira - Im going to live at Marios

Tito doesnt move

Tito - But I thought

Moira - Dont be upset

She straightens up and goes to give him a kiss on the lips
but he turns his head away

Tito - But arént you happy here

Moira - Well for the moment Id rather stay with him
Tito looks at the floor defeated

Moira turns her back on him and looks off in the
distance through the loft window The streets are empty
The city towers loom on the horizon

Tito - What if Alex comes back

Moira (very surprised by the question) - Well Hed go
straight to jail wouldnt he

Tito doesnt know what to say He looks dejected

134 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR MARIOS HOUSE NIGHT)

Mario - Listen not only did he injure a cop but he also
ran away

Moira does not look convinced Mario plays his last card
Mario - And theres a warrant out for his arrest
Moira - How do you know

Mario - already told you A cop told me

Moira looks away Its night They are both at Marios
The decoration is insipid and low class On a shelf
framed photos of Mario and his family are arranged
around a strange metallic vase that weve seen before at
Moiras studio Moiras belongings are scattered all over
the room

Mario - Please dont talk to me about him again

Mario is peeved He bustles around the room and sits
down at a table deliberately turning his back on Moira
He starts watching a boxing match on the TV

Moira picks up the framed photo of us two as children
laughing in our bath tub that was lying amongst her
things

‘cae

Then she leaves the room
I go through the wall that separates me from the
outside

135 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR MARIOS LITTLE GARDEN NIGHT)

I find myself a few feet above the overgrown garden that
Moira is walking through Mario lives on the ground
floor of a small old building in a semi-industrial suburb
My sister sits down on a bench between bare branches
She shivers from the cold and looks up at the stars

The night is a deep dark blue

The TV goes off inside Mario comes out and goes over
to Moira He pretends to be interested in the sky

Mario - You know think the two of us could be real
happy together

Moira does not answer Doubt-ridden seconds tick by
Mario - Are you thinking about the stars

Moira - I was thinking about Oscar

Mario sits down next to her

Moira - Its funny I didnt really realize he was dead at
first For a long time I felt like there was a kind of
presence around me Only now all of a sudden I really
feel that well that hes gone for good and Im all
alone

Mario is irritated by her reply At the same time my
vision gets agitated too Mario insists

Mario - You dont think we could be happy

Moira - I hope so

Mario (annoyed) - Im not keeping you here you know
You can split when you want At least that would make
things clear

He gets up abruptly Moira grabs him kisses him and
clasps him to her

Moira - love you

Mario shrugs his shoulders

Moira - You know Im only twenty but I sometimes
feel like my whole life is behind me

Mario - Theres no point rehashing the past If I started
thinking about all the people Ive lost I could start crying
too

They head back to the house

‘Mario - My mom knew a woman who woke up at the
morgue She told her there was absolutely nothing to see
that everything was black

Moira - Mm I know

Mario - The future is the only thing-

My vision flickers I dive down onto Moiras head but I -

go through her flesh I turn round trying to knock into
her again But its no use I go through her body again

I fly up above her Mario and Moira walk towards the
house I fling myself at Moira one last time passing
through her from head to toe Its no good I plunge into
the dark soil where there is nothing to see

Nothing but black

Loo (INTERIOR MORGUE DAY)

Still black

But noises slowly break through the silence an electric

buzzing gentle regular plumbing sounds then closer and
more muffled something that sounds like rasping
EL breathing
Then a slit of horizontal light splits through the darkness
The slit widens like eyelids opening My eyes are
covered by a pale green cloth Through the cloth
glimpse the light from a neon tube
I lift up the cloth covering my face with one hand The
white painted ceiling is slightly stained with damp
Nearby lying on a table the feet of a corpse stick out
from under a sheet
I am at the morgue The room looks like a huge empty
hospital room with a few tables and a row of sinks on one
side I try to get up but slump back down I lie still for a
moment breathing jerkily I hear footsteps My vision
blurs and goes black again

137 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR MORGUE DAY)

ok

ane I open my eyes’ again I am lying on a table in another
room A few feet in front of me a police officer is
og talking to a doctor in a white coat I moan The doctor
comes over and examines my eyes

Doctor - Ive never seen anything like this before

The police officer comes over too He waves his hand in
front of my eyes

Police officer - Can you see me Daniel come
over here
o Directors note From this scene on Oscar goes back to a subjective

POV like the one before his déath but now slightly altered as though he
hasnt fully recovered all his sensory capacities

I glimpse the silhouette of the man named Daniel
standing behind the door with his back firmly turned
The police officer goes over to get him

Police officer (OS) - Hes opened his eyes

He takes his colleague by the arm but the latter snatches

it away and walks off into the corridor I hear them
whispering to each other

I raise a finger towards the door But my finger flops
back down And my eyelids close

138 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR ROOM IN MORGUE DAY)

My eyelids open again A male nurse is washing my
wounded chest in a small tiled room On the other side of
a glass door the dector is talking to a police officer
Doctor - I dont know But hes alive alright and we
cant keep him here You take him or have him
transferred to the hospital

Police officer - But he doesnt even have civil status any
more I mean we can hardly bury him can we
Doctor - I dont know Contact his family

My eyelids close again

139 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR ROOM IN MORGUE DAY)

My eyelids open

The door to the tiled room closes behind me Helped by a
male nurse I am shuffling down a dreary gray corridor
A police officer accompanies us We arrive in front of
another door The police officer opens it it gives on to a
waiting room

Moira and Tito are already there Tito avoids my eye and
looks down as he greets me Moira who is standing on
the other side of the room smiles nervously when she
sees me She says nothing

Police officer - Here he is Hes yours now It might
be better if he sat down”

Male nurse - Well be right next door

He smiles and leaves with the police officer

I stumble into the room Tito is hesitant about helping
me I go over to my sister who looks at me petrified I

faise my hand to touch her Moira instinctively shrinks

back

I stand still Fito makes an effort he puts his arm around
my waist and leads me over to the bench I sit down
Tito - Are you OK

I carry on looking at Moira without answering She
keeps her distance and opens the window to let some air
in

Moira (to Tito) - Im sorry I cant help it

Embarrassed by Moiras reaction Tito pretends nothing
happened He sits down next to me

Tito - Cant you talk

My eyes blink

140 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INT MARIOS CAR IN FRONT OF MORGUE DAY)

I am in the back of an old sports car Through the
window I can see Tito talking to a morgue official and a
police officer We are in front of the main entrance of an
official gray building Above the parking lot I can hear
a train rumbling along the elevated railway

Tito - You really cant keep him

Morgue official - Well no I mean hes not

He shuts up at the sight of Tito and Moiras anguished
expressions

Police officer - Well he was lucky anyway Let us
know if he gets his speech back

Mario is in front of me at the wheel Moira is next to
him smoking a cigarette Mario taps the wheel
impatiently Moira glances over at the back seat

Moira - Look at him Its obvious he isnt normal Its
not the same Oscar

Mario - Shut up
ee

ia
hee

Tito takes his leave of the two men and comes back to the
car He slides in beside me behind Mario and closes the
door

Mario - Well where we going

A strained silence occurs Mario abruptly starts driving

Moira - I cant deal with this

Tito looks out at the sidewalk rolling by

I slowly raise my right hand and put it on my sisters
shoulder She screams Mario slams on the brakes turns
round and shoves me back

The same situation recurs as though time were going in
circles but with slight variations in the attitude of the
protagonists

Marios gestures get progressively rougher until he
punches me making me close my eyes

Tito (OS) - Cool it

Mario (OS) - Seeing as you want him so much well
leave him at your place

Tito (OS very quietly) - Asshole

141 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR LOFT NIGHT)

I open my eyes Tito is sitting opposite staring hard at
me-We are in his loft Its night time The place is a real
mess

Tito - Ah youre awake at last You got off pretty
well in the end Not like Alex He may even be dead
because of you and youre here breaking our balls I
hope youre not hungry ‘cos theres nothing to eat And
dont start thinking Im going to keep you here youll be
going to your sisters tomorrow Im only your cousin
mean theres no reason I should do you any favors We
were never really friends right And you were real
ungrateful to my parents to a lot of people in fact
Know what I always thought you were a real creep
But now youre just a vegetable At least thatll stop you
from hurting other people

Titos voice changes pitch Behind him the room seems
to be compressing
I close my eyes

(INTERIOR LOFT NIGHT)

I open my eyes again the loft is cramped and dark Tito
has gone Leaning on my right hand I heave myself out
of the armchair I was sleeping in and head for the front
door In the darkness I can make out the house Alex
sculpted

I blink

143 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(EXTERIOR STREETS CANAL NIGHT)

I am in the street The night is deserted and colorless
The wind rustles a few old papers that flutter up from the
wet ground A sewer pipe gurgles like some kind of
animal To the right is a canal

I walk along the quay and arrive at the archway leading
to the underworld A sign warns that entry is forbidden
But I continue my walk along the quay inside the tunnel
Thedarkness deepens and the arch gets slightly narrower
A few rats dart out in front of me In a high-level alcove
two bums are sleeping forming a big shapeless bulk

I carry on

144 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR UNDERWORLD NIGHT)

A few yards further on I turn round The arch and the
canal seem to have disappeared behind me All I can see
is the smooth impenetrable wall So I carry on walking
along the damp-stained tunnel and go past an old plaque
with rusted letters

All of a sudden the tunnel opens into a larger space I
glimpse candlelight at the end I head towards it and
discover some stairs I go up them The sound of metal
scraping on stone echoes out from somewhere
At the top I push open a half-closed door

145 - ALTERED SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR UNDERWORLD NIGHT)

And discover a man slumped on a wooden crate
scraping the wall with a metal spoon A half-burned
candle flickers beside him Lines have been scratched in
the wall as though tocount the days The man has is
back to me He looks like Alex

I moan But the words that stutter out of my mouth are
guttural The syllables dont flow properly

Me - Alex

The man stops scraping and turns round It is Alex But
he has a different cold expression on his face

Me - Alex

Alexs cold composed expression remains

Alex - What do you want

Me - Im glad to see you

Alex doesnt reply He looks at me for a long time

Alex - Looks like you missed the lights if you dont
want to discover hell youd better find your next womb
in ahurry you know

Me (nonplused) - I dreamed I was dead and I woke up
at the morgue

A scornful smile creeps over Alexs face

Me - Yes I dreamed I was dead and that I was flying
Alex - Stop lying Youre dead as a doormat

Me - No Why dyou say that You can see that Im
here I can see you You can see me

Alex - No I cant see you And you know full well that
Im just a projection of your mind like everything else
you think you can see and that your body is being
eaten by worms right now or wait no thats not it
They burned you didnt they

Alex face looks increasingly scary it seems to be
metamorphosing into another

Me - What

Now I understand that his face has taken on the form of
mine and that he is now talking to me with my voice
Alex - Yeah they torched you You remember dont

you

Me (terrified) - No

Alex (self-satisfied) - What do you mean no Close your
eyes and youll see Go on make an effort With any
luck youll end up finding your ashes somewhere

Me w aee

Alex - Go on Look

Me -

Alex (more aggressive) - Go on close your eyes

I close my eyes

Blackness

146 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR FURNACE CREMATORIUM)

The harsh crackling of flames sizzles all around me
incredibly clearly a second before my vision bursts out
of the obscure hollow socket of an already charred eye
Right near me in an over-intense light a face is being

devoured by the flames Despite its advanced state of

decompositien I end up recognizing it its mine The
burning blackened flesh half-consumed seems to be
moving Parts of it puff up and explode Blisters pop
oozing a kind of greasy pus Some parts are still familiar
while others are as unrecognizable as a hunk of meat on a
grill My face is inexorably coming apart revealing the
bones that are already cracking The rest of my features
turn red and melt under the scorching heat The last
patches of skin shrivel up and turn black

Horror-struck my vision is suddenly violently shaken by
blasting flames that are even more powerful than the
previous ones

I can see nothing but flames all around me They end up
blinding me like an intense white light

It lasts a moment

But little by little they disappear giving way to a
peaceful silence The white gradually turns a deeper and
deeper gray revealing a texture that looks like ashes seen
from very close up

Calmness returns while my vision slowly retracts through
a metallic substance

147 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR MARIOS LIVING ROOM KITCHEN
LATE AFTERNOON)

I emerge out of a small metal urn Its the strange vase
that Ive already seen several times at my sisters It is
now standing on a small shelf in Marios living room

ws

I come to a stop in front of the surface of the urn where
my name is clearly engraved Oscar Cinder and the
dates 1977-1999 Peace and quiet finally return

But around the urn are framed photos of Mario posing

with his football buddies and photos of his family

My anxiety returns with a piercing sound

Moira (OS) - I cant bear to see that thing here any more
My vision now out of body and birds eye pivots and
discovers Moira sitting on a chair staring at the shelf
Moira - think its morbid to want to keep mv brothers
ashes like a trophy Its hard enough accepting thats all
thats left of a whole life without being confronted with
the past forty times a day

Mario who is sitting near her on a chair with a bottle in
front of him gives her an exasperated look

Mario - Dont be crazy What do you want to do put it
in a cupboard Have a little respect I thought youd like
it I mean it is your brother ‘n all

Moira - Listen that thing is not my brother My brother
is dead It upset me a damn sight more than you think
and I dont want to think about it any more now

Mario brushes his hand over his face as if to hide his
disagreement

Mario - Alright alright Chill out Do what you want
with it

Mario looks away and goes back to flicking through a
magazine

Moira gets up and grabs the urn

She crosses the living room and goes into the kitchen

She prizes open the lid of the urn and pours the contents
into the stainless steel sink Once the urn is empty she
throws it into the plastic trash can full of garbage Then
she comes back to the sink and runs some water onto the
small pile of ashes

Moira - Goodbye Oscar

The water gradually flushes the remains of my body
away It freaks me out
My vision rushes over to my sisters face then her hands
then over to the ashes disappearing into the plumbing
then back to my sister who stands there without flinching

148 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR PLUMBING AND SEWERS HALF-LIGHT)

My disembodied vision delves into the plumbing chasing
after my remains as they scatter into the filthy water

I am tossed amidst various bits of garbage trying hard
not to lose sight of my ashes

Strong currents sometimes sweep me this way and that
down a winding maze lined with mold The pipes get
wider in the semi-darkness go through new ducts and
gush out into a larger space full of stagnant sewage

The current belches out and dissolves into this
unspeakable pit of refuse

A few large rats are swimming in the mud and vermin are
teeming all over the place Im afraid for my ashes
scattered amongst this filth and these creepy crawling
shapes I get closer to some strange insects which seen
this close look like half-cockroach half-worms
Surrounded by larvae one of these monsters - who had
been sucking up the filth floating around it - starts
sucking up part of what I recognize to be my ashes Once
satisfied it raises its oral organ while expelling rings of
some unidentifiable substance that could be excrement or
could be eggs out of the posterior extremity of its body
A surge of searing anxiety swells within me again
stronger than ever My vision tears itself away from this
organic hell and lifts me up into space in quest of a
soothing light

149 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR STREET LATE AFTERNOON)

I finally emerge into the open air through a sewer cover
up into the streets of the city Its a cold rainy late

tl

-
afternoon Despite the heavy leaden sky the street lamps
are not on

Tito and Nelly abruptly enter my field of vision walking
down the sidewalk alongside a large dark oppressive
’ stone wall

Nelly - Everything re-awakens life is like a cycle where
nothing gets lost Either you live on through your ashes
by nourishing a beautiful plant or you live on through
your children

Worried by the underlying maternal instinct in Nellys
words Tito stiffens Ss

Tito - Yeah but youre being too poetic Most times
people have children for economic reasons Like my
parents you know Sometimes I really think they brought
me into this world so I could help them when theyre old
That way they avoid going into a home

Nelly - Oh thats too mean

Tito - And youre too naive about your relationships
Unconvinced Nelly changes the subject

Nelly - So where have they gone

Tito - I guess theyve gone to visit the grave of Moiras
parents By the way did you know my mothers let
herself be conned by a sect

Nelly seems surprised

Just then my vision rushes through the wall next to
them

150 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(REMEMBRANCE HALL EXTERIOR CEMETERY LATE
AFTERNOON)

swiftly fly through several walls and corridors before
coming to a halt in the long high-ceiling corridor of a
crematorium Remembrance Hall stingily lit by sodium
lamps All down the corridor the walls have been
partitioned into small nooks with mortuary plaques inside
them Down below my uncle and aunt are in front of a
basic plaque with two names engraved on it David G
aon ae

Cinder - Elsa Delaney along with the date of their joint
death

Balancing on a small sliding ladder my aunt places three
ugly fake flowers into the ring provided Her face seems

’ thinner and her eyes are brighter than usual

My aunt (very softly) - Its hard to survive in this
world you kriow poor dear sister But I know its hard
for you where you are too At the center the other day
they explained that youre surrounded up there by inferior
spirits and all kinds of ectoplasms trying to drag you
down So I pray for you constantly But you know I
dont think itll be long before I join you

Down below my uncle watches her with a frown

My uncle - Say did you talk to Moira about the
cemetery expenses

My aunt - Not yet

Her husband starts walking back down the corridor to the
exit

My aunt clambers down off the ladder and catches up
with him

My uncle - Theres nothing to be ashamed about I
mean weve paid for everything And now shes growi
up she could take care of the plot

My aunt doesnt answer My uncle pursues

My uncle - Its not as if we dont have enough problems
with your tumor and all Nobody pays to keep us alive
They leave the Remembrance Hall which is in a corner
of the cemetery by a wall that backs on to an old
building almost right under a bridge with cars driving
over it

My aunt - Okay calm down Ill talk to her about it
My uncle - Especially as she must be earning well with
those porn dances she does I hope she hasnt picked up
one of those new-fangled diseases at least what with all
these new people shes been hanging out with

Another voice is already drawing me away My vision
suddenly changes course

”™
I rise up above the leafless trees of the cemetery over the
bridge I speed across the town and in a split second Im
at the Power

151 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR NIGHTCLUB LATE AFTERNOON)

I pass through the walls and find myself in the dingy
corridor that leads to the dressing rooms -

Two people I know are just below me in the narrow
space Morgane and the boss of the Power

Morgane (annoyed) - OK so Im sick so what Thats no
reason to stop living is it

Boss - Dont take it bad Im not bothered about the fact
that youre still sleeping with other guys what gets me is
that you havent warned your former partners

Morgane - What You must be kidding Maybe youd
like me to just pick up the phone and You want me to
wear a sign while Im at it

Boss (awkwardly) - Not even Mario Dont you even

want to tell him

Morgane (decisively) - No not even Mario I didnt
know I had it then you know Anyhow we only slept
together twice Im sure he didnt get it and I dont want to
freak Moira out for no reason

Boss - Um hmm

Morgane - I mean nobody ever told me Its not my
fault if some people dont want to take precautions

The boss is embarrassed

Boss - Yes but still it bothers me for Mario

My vision escapes out of the corridor and zips through a
few walls out of the Power

152 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR BUILDING SITE END OF DAY)

I emerge onto a building site surrounded by fences next
to the nightclub

Two municipal vans are parked next to bags of cement
covered with a plastic tarpaulin A light drizzle falls on
the virtually nocturnal decor

Up ahead at the end of a muddy dirt path rutted with
’ deep tire tracks the night watchman and Mario are
standing next to a car The trunk is open The night
watchman a skinny friendly man with a mustache
hands Mario a sawn-off shotgun Mario handles it
impressed

Night watchman - Nowadays its you versus the world
boy People will fuck you over to survive without your
even noticing it So you always gotta be ready to defend
yourself You see Mario my shooters like my best
friend the only thing I can count on 24 hours a day Its
taken me some time but Ive learned to get respect You
dont have kids but say you did and some guy touched
your boy up one day

Mario examines the end of the barrel not paying much
attention to what his friend his saying So the watchman
changes the subject

Night watchman - I can show you how to saw yours
down if you like I knows all about guns

Mario suddenly starts playing with the shotgun like a
cowboy Then he aims a target we cannot see

Mario - Yeah youre right It feels good

Night watchman - What are you doing this weekend
Mario lowers the gun and snaps to in a very good mood -
Mario - Im going away with Moira We dont want to be
here for the New Year so were going off on a romantic
weekend

The watchman looks at him with a smutty smile

Night watchman - Lucky devil Specially as your
woman seems real hot huh

I suddenly recognize a familiar voice in the distance My
vision flies off again and soars through a few buildings

153 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INT MARIOS APARTMENT LANDING LATE AFTERNOON)

I come out in the small entrance corridor to Marios

’ apartment Moira is in the open doorway Standing on the

landing opposite her is Victor

Moira - What did you say Im sorry I dont
fucking believe it If Oscar could hear you Im
sorry Is that what you came to say

Victor - Maybe Im not expressing myself very well
but

Moira - Listen its people like you that this life a heap of
shit If you really want to make me happy you know
what you should do Kill yourself But dont use a
razor that would be too quick No youd have to die
with your head pulverized under a truck or something
gruesome like that

Victor purses his lips but manages to get a grip

Victor - OK I can understand you being annoyed
Moira - Dyou realize that Alex may even be dead too
because of a slimeball like you

Victor stands there helplessly He doesnt know what to
say Moira doesnt give him time to think

Moira - Im asking you straight like a favor youd be
doing for Oscar kill yourself Id feel really relieved
Victor swallows his reply lowers his head turns heel and
leaves the landing Moira spits out one last insult

Moira - Little shit

She slams the door with tears of hatred rolling down her
cheeks

I go through the walls out of the building

154 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR MARIOS APARTMENT LATE AFTERNOON)

I find myself outside Victor shoves the main door open
and comes out onto the street Suzy is waiting for her son
in front of the building with a worried look Victor
storms past her without even looking at her

Suzy - How did it go

Victor does not reply Suzy catches up with him and puts
her hand on his arm Victor spins round and slaps his
mother before she can dodge his blow

’ Victor - Well you got what you wanted you damn
whore Now they all wish I were dead Great idea you
had

His mother contains herself and tries to hold her son
tight Victor bursts into nervous sobs

Suzy - There there calm down

Victor - Fuck off and leave me alone And Oscar can
go rot in hell too Its not my fault he tried to shoot
stupid prick

Suzy - Listen its all over now all over I never loved
Oscar He didnt mean anything I felt sorry for him
thats all Youre my son and I love you

Then while Suzy carries on hugging Victor my
increasingly restless vision breaks away from them and
goes back through the facade of Marios building and
over the landing looking for my sister

155 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR-MARIOS APARTMENT LATE AFTERNOON)

I emerge into Marios living room again above my sister
who is beside herself with rage mumbling words I cant
understand properly

I go over and place myself in front of Moira in her line
of vision It almost looks like she can see me

Moira (to herself) - If my life is fucked its because of
my brother and his dumb friends I want them to go
away all of them go away and leave me alone Go
away

In a rage Moira picks up an ashtray and flings it across
the living room (and across my vision) at a framed photo
The photo topples over and the glass breaks I leave my
sister and go over to the photo Under the bits of glass I
recognize a now damaged photo of us two as children

157 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR SEA END OF DAY)

I soon find myself over the ocean I had never seen during

my life The city has disappeared behind me and all I can

see is this huge undulating surface dark and monotonous
but nonetheless reassuring I realize that this soothing
vision does not look like a real sea for it too is very
simplified

My vision floats above the water for a moment rocked
by the gentle lapping of the waves ebbing and flowing
Then my vision calmly tilts and I discover the horizon
that separates the sea from the sky A gray mass of
clouds stretch endlessly above me They too are moving
in a peaceful undulating movement like the sea Little
by little I let myself be taken over by this padded gray
music All of a sudden a chink opens in the clouds and I
discern a space filled with a magnificent golden light that
seems way out in the beyond

My vision almost instantaneously propels itself towards
this chink which has now closed up again It doesnt
matter because I plunge into the cumulus mass anyway

158 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(ABOVE THE CLOUDS DUSK)

A mist envelops me I am going through thick clouds
Then the gray vapors brighten and I emerge above the
sunlit clouds The oblique rays of the sun etch organic
contours in the clouds underlining their orange-tinted
wisps and forming purplish-blue-gray shadowy hollows
Above the clouds the heavenly dome is streaked with
colors from salmon pink to violet This vision is
extremely beautiful

I float in an oceanic peace Thousands of whispery
human voices wash over me

I fly over this sea of clouds for a long time without
encountering a single crack This great fluffy orange

immensity warm and bright exudes a feeling of
happiness I have never known before

But aclearly defined moving object suddenly bursts into
’ the empty vastness of my field of vision

Alex (OS) - Oscar

I recognize ‘Alexs voice and my vision till then
slumbering sharpens again identifying the object

moving through the sky Its a small airline plane flying

above the twilight clouds My vision is sucked towards
it

159 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR PLANE DUSK)

and a second later Im inside

The plane is almost empty and I immediately spot Alex
sitting on the edge of a row of seats

He is talking to a woman with a baby sitting on the other
side of the aisle

Alex - My name is Oscar Derderian

Woman - And what do you do

The woman smiles at him but Alex is put out by the
question

Alex - Right now

The woman nods quietly Alex looks at her for a moment
and finally seems reassured

Alex - Im going to try and start a new life
somewhere

The woman carries on smiling peacefully at him
obviously not wanting to seem indiscreet

Woman - Well youre young Im sure youll succeed in
your new life

Alex smiles in a good mood

The baby starts crying and the woman uncovers her
breast for him to suckle I move in very close Closer
still The baby who calmed down instantly is suckling
hungrily to a regular rhythm eyes closed All I can see is
his mouth And the nipple feeding him I stay motionless

in front of this reassuring image for a long time while a
new feeling of happiness surges within me reaching
bliss

’ But I must have imperceptibly drawn back little because
I can now see the womans face again which following
the rhythm of the suckling turns into my mothers face
then back to the unknown womans face then my
mothers and so on For a split second I think I can also
make out the silhouette of my father sitting where Alex
is

Alex - Is he your only child

The flash images of my parents instantly disappear and
Im back to Alex and the unknown woman sitting in the
plane

Woman - No he has a sister who loves him more than
anything

The baby starts coughing and dribbling milk

Just then anxiety sweeps over me again happiness turns
to unease the colors change darken and the stressful
noise of the planes propellers drowns me

I lunge out of the plane

° 160 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(ABOVE THE CLOUDS EVENING)

Wrenched out of the plane my vision plummets through
the mass of clouds like a stone The dark gray diffuse
mist surrounds me again until I emerge on the other side
of the clouds Night has fallen and the sky is now dark
blue

I carry on falling My vision tilts downwards and I
rediscover the city speeding towards me with increasingly
strange and illogical proportions

161 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR ROAD EVENING)

I plummet down towards the terraces of the big tower

blocks and plunge into the narrow crack between them

ending my fall above an avenue that leads to a road with
cars zooming by in both directions Their head lamps
make the wet asphalt gleam Luckily my vision settles
above a car that looks like Marios

Moira (OS) - You see for a long time my brother meant
everything to me

I instantly identify my sisters voice and swoop into the
car

161 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR MARIOS CAR IN FRONT OF TUNNEL EVENING)

Mario is driving He nods silently as Moira speaks She
is sitting beside him

Moira starts talking again deep in thought

Moira - But maybe I was too hard on Victor

Mario - Dont worry Dont make a big deal about it
Anyway he deserved it

Moira looks at Mario

Moira - Anyway Im very glad were going away
Mario turns to her and lifts his hand to stroke the back of
her neck But Moira suddenly draws back

Moira - Watch out

She points to the road and my vision pivots to the front
A horn blares a truck is bearing down on us in the
oncoming direction Behind it I can see the tunnel dug
into the mountain getting closer It looks like the one
where my parents had their accident A green light is
flashing at the entrance

Mario spins the wheel round and straightens up the car
that had drifted onto the left-hand lane

And a fake memory comes flashing back
stroboscopically

Mario and Moira abruptly turn into my father and
mother A second honk blares out even closer The lights
of the truck bearing down on the car dazzle my father
White light invades the screen My mother cries out My
vision is propelled out of the car

163 - FAKE FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT)

discover the images of my parents accident These early
80s images are not completely realistic they resemble a
bad mental reconstruction of an event where I see myself
from the outside

Among the debris of the crumpled car I make out the
blood-ridden corpses of my parents They have taken on
an even more terrifying appearance than in my previous
memories

The fire brigade and the police are already on the scene
In the midst of the muddle of flashing lights sirens and
shouting I watch the emergency workers running around
trying to free my parents’ bodies while police officers
holding light beacons try to control the traffic at the
entrance to the tunnel

A fireman takes my sister and I away from this confusion
towards a building by the entrance to the tunnel As he
walks the decor around him changes He changes too

164 - ALTERED FLASHBACK
(INTERIOR LANDING PARENTS’ BUILDING NIGHT)

into my aunt walking towards me and my sister still
children on the landing in my parents apartment block
The children stop playing and watch her walk over She
kneels down in front of them and talks to them with great
care

Aunt - Oh my poor dears I wont be able to keep

you
The last after-images of flashing lights disappear along
with my aunt

And as I move towards the two children squeezing each
other tight the decor metamorphoses behind them
again

and I see them in my parents yellow bedroom where

’ we made our pact This time the memory is seen face on

as though from the outside and I visualize all the details
Oscar (child) - Theyre going to separate us Aunt wants
us to go to an orphanage

They are sitting on the floor under the darkened window
Moira - We wont see each other any more

Oscar (child) - No but

Moiras lips pout sadly Oscar would like to say
something else but he swallows his words He stares at
the razor blade he is holding and turns to her

Oscar (child) I I promise well never leave each
other And and if I die Ill come back to get you
Moira - Me too

Oscar (child) Do you swear

Moira - Yes Like you

He takes my sisters hand and holds the razor blade up to
it Moira is frightened and pulls her arm away

Oscar - You have to This is how pacts are made

He cuts a small nick in her thumb then his They bond
their two thumbs together Blood trickles down their
hands

My sister goes pale and so does my double They look at
each other dizzily

Moira - Youll never ever leave me

Oscar (child) - No Never

Then silence

But a sarcastic presence interrupts this memory

Me (OS) - That promise is impossuble to keep

My vision then discovers another double of me adult
also sitting in the bedroom

Oscar (adult) - No dead person has ever been able to
communicate with the living

My little sister cries harder
166 - FAKE FLASHBACK
(EXTERIOR ROAD BUILDING NIGHT)

3 The bedroom turns into a road and a Care worker
drags little Moira away from Oscar the child Oscar the
adult is still standing by his child double hounding him
Oscar (adult) - You see Oscar due to your promise
youve already let the colored lights that could have raised
you to other dimensions go by Now theres only one way
out if you want to get away from the nightmares you
create youve got to reincarate yourself fast But you
mustnt miss the right womb A lot of wombs are going to
attract you with pulsating yellow lights These yellow
glows are the only doorways back into the world of the
living But be careful you have to move fast and not
all of them are good

Oscar (child) - But how will I know

I hear my little sister crying my name and Oscar the child
turns round to Moira

A police officer is making her get in a car The door
closes behind herand the car drives off towards the
entrance of the tunnel My vision darts into the tunnel

162 cont - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR MARIOS CAR NIGHT)

But once inside my vision sees Moira already grown
up sitting next to Mario as they head off on their
weekend away

The truck that had honked at them rumbles past Mario
sticks his head out the window and yells at it

Mario - Fucking truck

The car plunges into the tunnel which is getting darker
and darker The situation calms down for a few seconds
while Moira slips a cassette into the car stereo in front of
her

Moira - How about we stop at a motel overlooking the
sea

But shouts echo out behind us My vision pivots towards
the back window and emerges outside in the tunnel

167 - MENTAL AND OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT)

3 to discover plain clothes cops that look exactly like the

ones in the bar where I died chasing Oscar adult who is
running full tilt to get away from them

A cop - Catch him Hes trying to get away

My vision is flying in front of my double looking at him
Breathless and despairing my double pulls the bag of
Ecstasies out of his pants opens it and still running
does his best to gulp down the 40 pills inside

Then he slows down and before the cops can catch up
with him starts smiling

One of the cops pulls his gun out in a rage and fires at my
double BANG A techno music beat blares out As
though affected by the dull thudding of the music the
tunnel seems to be closing in on my body now lying on
the ground

My vision pivots towards the exit and flees the tunnel
chasing Marios car

emerge from the tunnel at the same time as the car out
on the other side of the city that has turned into a kind of
suburb under construction Everything is plunged into a
tense unreal darkness as though there was an electrical
blackout

Snatches of urban decor zip by under me sometimes -

undergoing anamorphosis

I can hardly make out the sky which is hidden by a thick
layer of organically reddy-brown clouds

The same music I heard in the tunnel is still thudding but
the nature of it has changed as though it were distant and
reverberating under a large dome Marios car has
disappeared and I roam through the streets in the
darkening half-light A whooshing sound accompanies
my movements

169 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR WALL PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

Suddenly at the surface of a red-brick wall I finally
glimpse a tiny palpitating yellow glow which attracts me
by its strangeness

Inside two mosquitoes are mating Seen from very close
up it is an absolutely terrifying sight

My vision retracts and flies off elsewhere

Directors note From now on Oscars vision has more and more
trouble fixing itself anywhere and his distorted visions are affected by
interference from vague images from his past or decors faces and scenes
that overlap each other until they jam Every now and then a snatch of
reality returns generally bathed in or indicated by yellow lights The rest
of the time the chaotic mix of these distorted images should plunge the
spectator into complete disarray As the yellow images multiply and
Oscars vision is guided from one to the other the interference images
and the continuously dark backdrop will take on a progressively
nightmarish dimension organic and cosmic at the same time

170 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR COURTYARD PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

A new yellow glow attracts me much more perceptible
this time approach a concrete courtyard where two
guard dogs are copulating savagely The dog mounts the
growling bitch and humps her clumsily The bitch
stumbles each time and the male has to grab her to get
going again The yellow glow pulsates out of their bodies
with every thrust

Suddenly terrified I draw away from them plunging
back into the black landscape

171 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR INDUSTRIAL ROAD PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

My vision pivots towards a street lamp that is casting a
powerful yellowy-green light over a recess under a
railway bridge I am irresistibly attracted to it

Under the light leaning against the hood of a truck pulled
up on the side a man and a prostitute are about to make
love standing up They are all that is lit up by the lamp
float nearer The man is rubbing himself up against the
girls back Her skirt is hitched right up He undoes his
pants Then he takes a condom out of his pocket and puts
it on before sliding his penis inside the girl He starts
pumping mechanically away in her The girl turns round
to look at him

For a split second Morganes face is superimposed on the
girls

My vision turns away from the roadside couple and flies
off

172 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR WASTE GROUND PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

I float in the obscurity attracted by the dull thudding of
music that now sounds closer and closer

I reach a huge waste “ground surrounded by fencing
where still in pitch darkness hundreds of people are
dancing to music thumping out of speakers hooked up to
posts I cannot clearly discern any of the faces
But suddenly behind the fence on the other side of the
waste ground a new yellow glow attracts me

173 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR WASTE GROUND PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

I cross over to it in a split second A brazier is burning
casting a flickering yellow light over the area A condom
wrapper lies next to a teenage boy making love to a girl
lying on the ground Their movements are fascinating

I can see a boy watching them standing slightly back
The girl cries out in pleasure and sits up towards the boy
Suddenly Victors face flickers over the face of this
stranger

I move away from the couple

174 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR PATH PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

A little further off between two other fences a narrow
path is gleaming strangely My vision is attracted towards
it

Two boys are standing there kissing Above them a
yellowing light bulb dangling from a cable swings in the
wind One of the boys gently steps back from his friend
and kneels in front of him Its Victor slowly unzipping
his partners pants The light quivers around them

For a split second Suzys face appears over his

I fly off over the city with its increasingly absurd and
simplistic contours

175 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR SUZYS KITCHEN PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

All of a sudden I make out a new yellow glow behind the
windows of an apartment

I go inside and find myself in Suzy and Victors fathers
kitchen The man -has stretched his right leg out and

slipped his toes into his wifes mouth She is licking
them Suzys backside covered in a translucent slip
writhes sensually Her mouth travels up her husbands leg
and starts sucking him off They are lit by a burning gas
‘ canister on the floor But it must be almost empty
because the flames constantly flicker The orangey half-
light reveals ‘the breathless orgasmic expression on the
husbands face his mouth wide open

The face of my uncle in the midst of a similar rapture
replaces the face of Victors father for a moment

My vision abandons them and crosses streets devoid of
all light

176 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR UNCLES LIVING ROOM PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

Until a lusterless glow draws me in mid-flight

Into an apartment that seems familiar Under the feeble
light of a lamp with a green and yellow cloth over the
shade a couple of sixty year-olds are making love As
approach I recognize my uncle standing behind my aunt
She is wearing a short-sleeved shirt and kneeling on an
armchair upholstered in a horrendous floral print My
uncle penetrates her My aunt starts crying

Aunt - Im too old

Uncle - No no

All of a sudden as my uncle speaks I perceive the face
of his son Tito in a flash

My vision retracts through the rest of the pitch black
town

177 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR BATHROOM LOFT PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

A beautiful glow draws me to the windows of a
bathroom misted over by hot steam The inside of the
room is intermittently lit by neon lights from a large sign
outside Its the bathroom in Titos loft

—
He is making love to Nelly who is crouched on all fours
naked on some bath towels Their love-making seems to
follow the rhythm of the distant beat of the party still
present in the distance This glow is very intense and the
beautiful passionate situation fills me with joy My
vision alters

Tito suddenly stops worried

Tito - Did you take your pill

Nelly - Yes no worries

My vision swoops onto a shelf with a half-finished pack
of contraceptive pills on it Then it speeds back to Nelly
and finally retracts disappointed while the glow is
resorbed into their bodies

I emerge again into the incomprehensible sight of the
dark city

178 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(EXTERIOR CITY PITCH BLACK NIGHT)

My vision moves over the obscure city and turns to the
horizon The regular rumbling of the nearby ocean
dissolves into the increasingly distant techno neat

The clouds hanging heavily over me have an unreal
consistency They start pulsating like a heart beat

This dark urban space has become so strange I no longer
even have any desire to move and my vision stops in
mid-air oo

The bottom of the sky has turned blood red as though
heralding a strange sun In the center of my field of
vision the light clearly picks out a building Above the
terrace five huge back-lit letters glow MOTEL

I think I hear Moiras voice saying Come while her
face flashes fleetingly by bathed in a very beautiful
yellow brightness

I approach over the city and perceive a beautiful bright
yellow glow coming from behind one of the windows
This glow is much more stable than the others

I go through the window pane

179 - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR YELLOW ROOM NIGHT-DAWN)

I find myself in an unfamiliar room a few feet above the
ground The first rays of dawn flow through a pane
covered in a thin yellow curtain In the middle of the
empty room is a bed that looks like the one in my parents’
bedroom On the mattress Mario and Moira are rubbing
against each other

A very intense glow emanates from their bodies

Moira - Come

Mario is wearing underpants and a T-shirt Moira is in
her bra and panties She is kneeling in front of Mario and
writhing her hips Mario holds her tight Numbed she
changes position She goes onto all fours with her head
facing the window this time Outside lights flick on in
the windows of the city as though it were already dawn
The decor forms again A heavy musical beat from afar
can be felt in the room

Mario takes his T-shirt off and kneels behind my sister
teady to make love to her He slips her panties to one
side revealing a fleeting glimpse of her inner thighs
Then he takes his-hardened penis out of his underpants
and penetrates her His body thrusts slowly in and out
Moira - Be careful

Manio slows down

Moira - I havent put anything in

But Mario carries on The sexual drumbeat mingles in
with their breathing and taking on the same rhythm
invades the room flitter around the couple around their
bodies I slip between them My vision shifts and hovers
above Moiras face as though I were right by her or in
Marios place Moira is breathing heavily

Stroboscopic interference visions of my own mother
having an orgasm suddenly surge forth

Mario (OS) - I dont care Ill give you a baby

At these words the images of my mother disappear and
my vision rises vertically above Mario and Moira A kind
of hazy transparent umbilical ectoplasm now links me to
the yellow glow still emanating from the belly of the
moving couple I feel like Im inside the blurred walls of
the ectoplasmic membrane for my perception of the two
of them becomes troubled like looking through an
aquarium

The yellow glow travels up the strange ectoplasmic
umbilicus towards me and invades my vision tringing
me an image A profound calm ensues

I vaguely glimpse a newborn baby in a delivery room
Gloved hands cut the umbilical cord and place the child
onto the mothers breast I cannot see her face But this
overly liquefied image is already diluting into the yellow
glow

My vision slithers laterally out of the ectoplasmic tunnel
and goes “out of body again I am floating above Mario
and Moira again They are still making love in the
increasingly yellow room Moira turns round to look at
Mario her lips parted He is cluyching her by the hips
Moira catches her breath

But the ectoplasm drags me in again and the couple
disappear in a yellow flash I perceive a more clearly
defined vision traveling up the ectoplasm A newborn
baby eagerly suckling a womans breast Is this a possible
future The image finally gets clearer and moves
slightly closer towards me

180 - MENTAL VISION OF THE FUTURE
(INTERIOR LOFT DUSK)

A woman whose face cannot yet see is breast feeding a
small baby The baby suckles ravenously eyes closed
with a regular rhythm My vision moves in very close to
this marvelous young milk-laden breast I stop in front
of this reassuring image for a long time The babys face
shows a feeling of happiness mounting to bliss

A girl (OS) - Arent you a happy little thing suckling
your mommy

A girls hand strokes the babys head

A girl (OS) - Whats his name

Moira - His name is Oscar

Moira Is sitting with oer baby in Titos loft Nelly and a
friend of hers are leaning over the baby coochy-cooing it
tenderly The baby gurgles They are lit by a very bright
a light bulb

In the loft behind them another girl friend of Nellys as
fresh-faced and pretty as the first is being chatted up by
the ever-nice Bruno A few words of their conversation
drift over to me of which “its a cosmic orgasm The
young girl laughs Tito is there too He turns the radio
up We hear a very cheerful song from the 70s remixed
with a thudding techno beat

Then Tito examines two books siting on the table next to
him the omnipresent book with the mandala on the cover
and The first three minutes of the universe He finally
picks up the latter and goes to sit on his bed to flick
through it On the wall above him a calendar in
psychedelic letters shows the year we are in 2001

Directors note From this scene on Oscars visions no longer fulfill
any out of body or subjective vision logic and their cinematic form is
closr to flashback form but much more freely cut up These mental
visions of a future life a kind of ultimate projection of Oscars desires
are unstable blurred and bathed at the edges by a yellowy-orange light
Normal colors only feature in the center of the image These images are
mixed with ellipses and unpredictable flashbacks like a collage of badly
adjusted moments

—
The setting sun tinges the room orange It is decorated
with many colored paintings and small models In a
corner a little kiddies section has been set up with angels
and mini planes hanging from the ceiling There is even a
mini lighthouse revolving its mini rays around the room
Moira gets up with the baby and goes out onto the
balcony

181 - MENTAL VISION OF THE FUTURE
(EXTERIOR BALCONY LOFT DUSK)

The roofs of the city stretch into the distance

All is still outside Its a beautiful evening Orangey-pink
clouds scud up in the sky Nelly comes out to join Moira
on the balcony and takes the baby in her arms Moira
straightens her golden yellow dress and looks at the sky
Nelly - So its over with Mario

Moira - Yes I think so I cant stand him any more
Nelly is silent for a moment then adds

Nelly - You can stay here as long as you like

Moira laughs and kisses Nelly on the lips

A distant noise approaches a small gray plane flying
across the sky The same one Moira and I saw the day I
died

Moira (to the baby) - Look Oscar theres an airplane
up in the sky

The plane rises higher and higher and disappears behind
the clouds

Through a chink in the clouds we catch a glimpse of a
vast distant space bathed in golden light Then the chink
closes and other fleeting images of a future life are
superimposed onto the clouds

We vaguely make out a child age 8 then a teenager
But the images flash up too fast

Just one image seems to linger a teenager making love
with a girl in an ultra-pop futuristic room
Then everything dissolves behind a yellow glow
179 cont - OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR YELLOW ROOM DAWN)

The yellow glow withdraws and goes back to its initial
spot as though flowing along the ectoplasm I pop out of
the top of the ectoplasm and perceive it as an increasingly
thin transparent cord linking me to my sisters belly

My vision “out of body once more sees Mario and
Moira They are still making love on the bed on all fours
opposite the window Morning has broken and the suns
rays light the room with a yellow gleam that is almost
white in parts

The beat thuds out again accompanying the couples
quickening breathing as Marios thrusting gets more
violent and mechanical He grips Moiras shoulders She
moans and half turning round bites his hand My vision
gets progressively blurred The image flickers all over the
place As I fly down towards them what remains of the
ectoplasm seems to be being re-absorbed into Moiras
body At the same time a multitude of viewpoints of this
scene race by as though I were approaching the couple at
many different angles simultaneously making it virtually
impossible to interpret the space I am now right near
them Their bodies perspire Their torsos rock to and fro
Moira is coming I go even closer to my sisters moist
belly I press myself up against the hazy pinkish skin
discovering beads of sweat around her naval And I go
into her body

182 - INTRAUTERINE
OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR MOIRAS BELLY HALF-LIGHT)

Seen from inside Moiras body Marios penis thrusts in
and out of the vaginal cavern It speeds up until he spurts
forth his seminal fluid that settles onto the humid walls of
the mucus membrane

The penis slowly comesto a halt then withdraws

The image finally settles The vaginal walls contract
Everything melts into a rosy-pink organic half-light

The comers of my vision darken A brighter spot persists
in the womb at the edge of the Fallopian tube Its glow
contracts and dilates to the still rapid heartbeat that
sounds very near

I float in this’ padded space for a moment before moving
closer to the uterine wall where an event is occurring

My vision progressively slips into the infinitely small
revealing a macroscopic world I had never imagined

183 - MOLECULAR
OUT OF BODY VISION
(INTERIOR MOIRAS WOMB HALF-LIGHT)

I draw closer to the glow It is coming from a finely-
grooved fringe in the mucus membrane I go even closer
At the end of this hollowed-out red fringe is the ovule
which looks like a kind of huge fibrous sponge and seems
to be lit from the inside

Rough-hued spermatozoids approach it like white
parasites They squirm rapidly Each one has a head and
a vibratile tail linked together by an intermediary
segment as long as the head and made of multiple spirals
A first spermatozoid accosts the surface of the ovule It
rushes head-first into the ovular cytoplasm and penetrates
the pellucid membrane Its tail breaks off abandoned at
the surface

Other spermatozoids try to penetrate the membrane Too
late the route is barred Once the first fertilizing seed has
been let in no others can penetrate the surface

My vision penetrates into the cytoplasm behind the
spermatozoid

Inside a most singular phenomenon occurs it turns head
over tail performing a kind of somersault

Then it carries on progressing into the ovule but now
preceded by the intermediary segment that had initially
been following

°

ecay
The male nucleus puffs up absorbing protoplasmic
liquid It steams straight ahead continuing on in the
direction of its penetration Then it abruptly deviates and
heads for the female nucleus The female nucleus shoots

’ off in turn Carried by the currents it travels in front of

the male nucleus but at a slower speed

The two nuclei meet Their dimensions are virtually
equal They intertwine and fuse together into one big
nucleus twice as voluminous

My vision spirals towards this new nucleus And melts
inside it

A bright white flash made of billions of colored dots
flares up

The rumbling stops dead

In a frenzied multicolored chaos fertilization has been
consummated

184 - FLASHBACK
IN SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR SQUAT-DOWN TOILET NIGHT)

Then the bright white light draws back as though carried

along a dark‘tunnel leaving behind it the image of my
arm stretched in front of me and blood trickling over the
wet white slab in the toilets Its an ultimate perception of
my moment of death but this time uniformly tinted red
The image decomposes into a kind of blood red magma
increasingly narrow and damp while aquatic sounds
swirl around me
185 - INTRAUTERINE VISION
(INTERIOR MOTHERS WOMB HALF-LIGHT)

The place has metamorphosed into a liquid spongy
semi-obscure intrauterine cavity where my arm now that
of a fetus floats in a kind of cosmic peace

A little light seems to penetrate inside this semi-darkness

highlighting the padded throbbing blurry red walls of

the womb

Behind my arm I can see what seems to be an umbilical
cord with blood flowing through it

While the reassuring double beat of two hearts cradles me
within watery sounds abstract images regularly flash
across the four corners of my field of vision

I am behind a membrane full of tiny blood vessels inside
the placenta But everything is hazy

Then the space starts to contract spasmodically
seemingly wanting to suffocate me or else evict me
Muffled cries and increasingly jerky breathing echo in the
midst of familiar organic sounds as though coming from
an unidentifiable place

On the other side of the protective membrane a powerful
beam of light splits through the maternal obscurity A
hand slithersin to this fleshy slit and tears the membrane
and the placenta The cold light grows in the red
obscurity The amniotic fluid flows away The gloved
hand widens the crack and pulls me towards the light
through a long tunnel that crushes me My vision
becomes sharper But the light is too bright and it blinds
me The noises are very painful

186 - SUBJECTIVE VISION
(INTERIOR HOSPITAL ROOM MORNING)

I can barely see the gloved hands dragging me out of the
vagina I emerge from my mothers body into a white

room that is way too brightly lit in a delivery ward
reminiscent of the late 1970s

The gloved hands turn me over and while my head is
upside down I see the delivery table and the sheet
’ stained with bright red blood White figures move around
me The umbilical cord is dangling from my body A
hand cuts it with glinting scissors

My heart beats faster My lungs inflate Air seeps into
them stinging me my vocal chords vibrate emitting
their first sound

I release my primal scream and while I am being carried
to my mothers breast I get a fleeting glimpse of her
face I think I recognize my mothers face not Moiras
Is this the memory of my one and only birth returning at
the moment of my death It must be but I dont have
time to be really sure Apart from this breast sliding into
my mouth everything is too confused and its all slipping
away already My eyelids close and I am plunged into
obscurity

A man (OS) - His name is Oscar

No more movement

No more thought No more breath
There is nothing left

Just blackness

And silence

And then after a long moment a word

THE VOID

which after a long minute also disappears
