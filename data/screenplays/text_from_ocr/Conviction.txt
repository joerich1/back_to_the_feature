WGAw 1329373
My Daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way

And he loved to steal your money

THE CLASH
We open with a series of IMAGES coupled with a gravelly
soulful world-weary VOICE--

The magnificent dense green beauty of an immense FOREST
filled with towering TREES--

PATRICK’S VOICE
I don’t waste time with Politics
Because who cares which Stooge is
gonna run the country

A deep reverberating CRACK as one of those enormous trees
begins to slowly TOPPLE OVER--

PATRICK’S VOICE
It’s absurd An illusion No one
man can possibly run this country

A huge TRUCK hauls a twenty-ton load of LUMBER--

PATRICK’S VOICE
America is nothing but a covenant
between the People made up of
Makers and Takers Creators and
Consumers

An enormous PAPER MILL where the wood is being PULPED--

PATRICK’S VOICE
A product goes up on a shelf then
some clown drops it in a goddamn
Shopping cart The runoff is cash

Endless sheets of PAPER are rolled onto gigantic BINDLES--

PATRICK’S VOICE
Cash is nothing but Paper which is
nothing but Trees which is nothing
but Nature which is nothing but
Creation all over again

The PAPER is borne to a cavernous BUILDING in Ft Worth
Texas THE BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING--

PATRICK’S VOICE
Because Life’s a goddamn Circle

And here it comes flowing like a river through the PRESS
UNCUT FEDERAL RESERVE PAPER CURRENCY--

PATRICK’S VOICE
Tf you Take you’d better make damn
sure you Make something in return
A FEDERAL CASH DEPOSITORY where shrink-wrapped BRICKS of
cold-hard GREENBACKS are readied for circulation--

PATRICK’S VOICE
If you dont youre gonna get
fucked with your pants on
BRICKS of CASH are loaded into the back of a BRINKS TRUCK--
PATRICK’S VOICE
I know this because Im the best
Taker that ever lived
The BRINKS TRUCK rolls down the street approaching a BANK--
PATRICK’S VOICE
And when I take the Paper You’d
better believe I plant the Tree
INT BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

A YOUNG WOMAN lies on her side in bed asleep She’s
beautiful olive-skinned late twenties

A HAND reaches into frame strokes her long black hair
traces over her body rests on her enormously PREGNANT BELLY

PATRICK’S VOICE Dont wake up

A MAN’S HEAD leans in-- we can’t see him it’s too dark-- and
kisses her belly Kisses her hair Disappears

INT BRIGHT ROOM - MORNING

The following SEQUENCE will be CROSS-CUT

TWO MEN sit side-by-side in tall barber-style chairs
stripped to the waist

PATRICK GAUTREAUX is Caucasian 45 salt and pepper ruggedly
handsome glinting green eyes crows feet

BOBBY “BOMB” HARDAWAY is Black 25 baby-faced shaved head
large brown eyes that see everything yet reveal nothing

PATRICK
Hit me

Hands reach into frame a brush applies adherent to Patrick’s
nose The hands press a LATEX PROSTHETIC NOSE into place--
EXT ROSECRANS AVE - BANK - DAY

A big brown LINCOLN idles at a meter spot on the bustling
Manhattan Beach thoroughfare

Just over a small rise a high-end MINI-MALL dominated by a
large REGENCY TRUST bank branch

And there it is outside the branch an idling BRINKS TRUCK
an ARMED GUARD standing beside hand resting on his sidearm

INSIDE the LINCOLN-- seen in quick CLOSE-UPS--

An EAR with an EARPIECE inside A POLICE RADIO mounted to
the DASH FINGERS punch a message into a BLACKBERRY

BOMB’S VOICE (0S)
Nine minutes to Larry

INT BRIGHT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hands press a conservative short AFRO WIG onto Bomb’s smooth
skull Hands apply a DARKER SKIN TONE to his face

PATRICK (0S)
I’ve never even heard of this
Wheel Is he local

BOMB (0S)
He’s from Indio I know what
youre thinking Goat But it’s
just one element We’re solid

The brush applies adherent to Bomb’s upper lip A thin
MOUSTACHE is pressed into place

PATRICK (0S)
Always do me proud Bobby You say
it’s solid then its solid
INT BROWN LINCOLN - ROSECRANS - DAY

Close on THE DRIVER 32 hawklike twitchy eyes black hair
in a ponytail This is VOVAN 29 though he looks 40

He pops a cigarette in his mouth lights it The police
radio SQUAWKS a call Vovan turns it down

PATRICK’S VOICE Please dont smoke in the car
On Vovan smiling shitty teeth taking a deep drag

PATRICK’S VOICE Not happy about this clown Bobby

Vovan rolls his eyes flicks the butt out the window

VOVAN
I’m sitting right here brother

PATRICK’S VOICE Just do me a favor and don’t sit in
a goddamn red zone
OUTSIDE we see the BRINKS TRUCK pull out of the parking lot
and disappear into traffic--

INT BRIGHT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see Patrick and Bomb from behind side by side as the
unseen MAKE-UP ARTIST applies finishing touches

BOMB
I‘m still too handsome

PATRICK
Actually you look like Bill
Cosby’s retarded nephew

They both start laughing It’s familiar banter

INTEXT - BROWN LINCOLN - ROSECRANS - DAY

Patrick emerges from the Lincoln carrying a briefcase He
walks up the incline toward the bank

compared to the Patrick we met in the first frame of this
movie he is a stranger Unrecognizable
INT REGENCY TRUST - DAY

DISGUISED PATRICK stands at the counter filling out a
deposit slip his eyes clocking the BANK LOBBY

The line of CUSTOMERS The TELLERS The CUSTOMER SERVICE
DESKS The GUARD by the door-- paunchy crew-cut mid-40s

Patrick stares at the Guard a moment Frowns
DISGUISED BOMB enters the lobby Wanders over to where
Patrick is standing starts filling out his own slip

When they talk it’s sotto and they don’t make eye contact

PATRICK
Guard’s different Add that to
your white-trash Wheel from Indio

BOMB
We could turn it off Its your

Pull close to Patrick as he mulls the odds

FOLLOW Patrick as he peels off from the counter and
approaches one of the Customer Service desks--

INTEXT BROWN LINCOLN - ROSECRANS - DAY

Vovan sits listening to the police radio He lights a
cigarette drags deeply ashes it onto the seat Prick

He digs around inside a small backpack He pulls out a
Snickers Digs around some more and pulls out a GLOCK lays
it on the seat beside the Snickers

INT REGENCY TRUST - DAY

Patrick sits at the desk of LARRY DENNIS 33 the red-headed
fresh-faced CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER

LARRY DENNIS
It’s terrific finally putting a
face to the name Doctor Hodge

PATRICK
Likewise Mr Dennis

LARRY DENNIS
Please call me Larry

PATRICK
Okay Larry Only my patients call
me Doctor You can call me
Nicholas Or justNicky
Larry’s smile is full of twinkles and dimples

LARRY DENNIS
Well That should be easy to
remember That’s my son’s name

Patrick returns Larry’s exuberant grin

PATRICK
I know

Larry’s smile falters a bit

LARRY DENNIS
Oh (beat) Did I tell you about
him I can never remember who I--

PATRICK
No Larry You’ve never told me
any of the numerous things I know
about your son Nicky

Larry tries to maintain his smile even though the
conversation has somehowtaken a turn

LARRY DENNIS
I‘m sorry

PATRICK
No need to apologize Just relax
and breathe through the nose

Larry’s eyes begin to dart around

LARRY DENNIS
Is there something--

PATRICK
Keep your eyes on me Larry

From Larry’s computer a CHIME sounds
PATRICK
Sounds like an E-mail Maybe you
oughtta open it

Larry’s hand trembles as he points and clicks

On his SCREEN a PHOTO IMAGE loads into view A small
charming ranch-style suburban HOUSE

LARRY DENNIS
Oh (beat) Jesus
Another picture LOADS A PLAYGROUND a YOUNG WOMAN pushing a
TOW-HEADED BOY on a swing

PATRICK
Your wife Denise Used to be a
lawyer Now she’s just a Mommy

Larry suddenly looks quite gaunt pale childlike

PATRICK
But you prefer it that way right
You’re the bread-winner now

Larry groans softly and his eyes dart over to the GUARD

PATRICK
Eyes forward Larry

Larry’s eyes flick back to Patrick

PATRICK
I’ve done this many times before
I’ve got a system It’s tested
and it’s perfect You’re not gonna
render my system imperfect right

Larry just stares at him glazed numb

PATRICK
You’re gonna have to hold your shit
together for the next few minutes
Or else I’m gonna have to make a
call And you reaily don’t want me
to make that call Nod yes if you
agree Larry

Larry slowly nods

PATRICK
And youd never do something stupid
like punch the 2-11 button under
your desk or that pager on your
hip right (beat) Hey isn’t it
Nicky’s birthday next Wednesday
Whatcha gonna get the little guy

Larry THROWS UP IN HIS MOUTH just a little bit but manages
to swallow it back down

PATRICK
Wow Larry Nicely done
LARRY DENNIS
Oh God

PATRICK
Now we’re gonna play pretend I’m
a tourist and you’re the ever-so-
helpful tour guide You’re gonna
show me all the sights

LARRY DENNIS
Please I can’t--

PATRICK
Starting with the Counting Room
That’s where you’re holding all the
tasty crispy depo paper that
Brinks dropped off ten minutes ago
(beat) So whadaya say Will you
be my tour guide

INT REGENCY TRUST - VAULT - CONTINUOUS

Patrick follows a drawn Larry Dennis past rows of safety-
deposit boxes which line the wall adjacent to the VAULT

They pass various bank EMPLOYEES who don’t suspect a thing--
it’s hardly uncommon for the Customer Service Manager to
escort clients to this part of the bank--

They make a left find a DOOR and Larry fumbles his keys
before finding the right one--

PATRICK
Easy Larry Easy--

Larry lets out a tiny moan finally opens the door--

Into the COUNTING ROOM--

Where four shrink-wrapped BRICKS OF CASH sits upon a STEEL
TABLE next to a COUNTING MACHINE and several double-locked
steel BURGHER BOXES which stand OPEN waiting to be filled
Patrick’s eyes SPARKLE at the CHUNKS OF GREEN-- all HUNDREDS--
Patrick opens his briefcase on the steel table pulls out a

COLLAPSED DUFFEL and OPENS it with a sweep of his arms like
its a pillowcase--
INT REGENCY TRUST - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Bomb stands sentry just inside the entrance keeping one eye

on the LOBBY and the other on the GUARD who yawns shifts
from one foot to the other--

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Vovan drives the Lincoln around to the SIDE of the bank
parks up against the RED-ZONE CURB idles there--

INT REGENCY TRUST - LOBBY

A robotic Larry Dennis emerges from the rear of the bank
followed by Patrick who is carrying a bulging visibly HEAVY
DUFFEL slung over his shoulder--

The GUARD is no longer standing at his post--

Patrick nods to Bomb as he passes both of them push through
the EXIT DOORS and now they’re OUTSIDE both grinning--

BOMB
Were clear were good--

They round the corner and their smiles drop when they see
the GUARD APPROACHING the LINCOLN blocking their path---

PATRICK
He’s in the fucking red Zone--

His eyes FLASH because it’s ONE FUCKED ELEMENT TOO MANY--

And we ZIP TO the Lincoln where VOVAN sees the frowning
Guard striding toward him

GUARD
Can‘t park there guy

Vovan stares at him Blinks

VOVAN
Say what Brother

GUARD
You’re in a red--

BLAM BLAM

Vovan BLASTS TWO ROUNDS out the window PLUGGING the Guard in
the chest-- The Guard GRUNTS CRUMPLES--

Instant PANDEMONIUM as BYSTANDERS SCATTER SCREAMING--—

Patrick DROPS THE DUFFEL and Bomb quickly SCOOPS IT UP
races toward the Lincoln--

Vovan steps out of the car grinning strangely as Patrick
rushes to the felled Guard--

GUARD
RedRed Zone

The Guard gasps coughs blood frowns at the sky in shock---

PATRICK
Christ I’m sorry man--

Bomb throws the duffel in the back slams the door--

BOMB

Patrick jumps to his feet RUSHES at Vovan and SLAMS him up
against the side of the car his eyes PURE BLACK FURY--

PATRICK

Patrick hurls Vovan to the ground moves toward the front of
the Lincoln while Vovan picks himself up grimacing--

VOVAN
Rent-a-Cop was walkin up on me--

BLAM The back of Vovan’s head POPS OPEN SPRAYING THE WALL--

Patrick JUMPS sees the GUARD still flat on his back with
his SMOKING SIDEARM pointed where Vovan’s head used to be--

The sound of SIRENS building getting CLOSER--
The Guard COUGHS and HEAVES and SPLUTTERS--

Bomb SLIDES into the passenger seat HOLLERS to a stunned
Patrick through the open driver-side door--

BOMB
COME ON NOW we got a MINUTE--

BLAM BLAM The Guard is SHOOTING AGAIN--
ll

Patrick TAKES TWO ROUNDS in his BACK-- He TOPPLES AGAINST THE
CAR smearing BLOOD all over the windows--

BOMB
GOAT

More SCREAMS from the scattering panicked BYSTANDERS as
Patrick CRUMPLES to the ground quickly going into SHOCK--

CLUNK The Guard’s SIDEARM LANDS on the PAVEMENT and he’s
no longer spluttering coughing or breathing he’s DEAD--

The SIRENS are so close they’re right around the corner--

Bomb slides over to the Driver’s Seat sees Patrick on the
ground dazed BLEEDING like crazy--

PATRICK
Bobby Go

BOMB

Patrick shakes his head levels a look at Bomb that is
absolute ice-cold Business

PATRICK
You have Five Seconds

Bomb gapes at him disbelieving His eyes fill with tears

BOMB

PATRICK

BOMB and PATRICK hold their locked-eyed STARE--

Bomb STOMPS the gas the Lincoln SCREECHES from the curb
LOOPS around the bank BANGS out onto ROSECRANS just as the
BLACK and WHITES jam up into the mini-mall parking lot--

BACK ON PATRICK Growing pale Losing too much blood

He finds himself staring into the dead milky eyes of VOVAN
crumpled against the wall ten feet away

The SIRENS and the SCREAMS and now the ANGRYSCARED SHOUTS of
POLICEMEN as they GATHER AROUND HIM--

PATRICK
Stupid (beat) Stupid man--

SMASH TO

Bomb speeds through side-streets his face a mask of shock
and outrage tears flowing He POUNDS the wheel

obsessively checking the REAR-VIEW--

He SCREECHES to a stop on a residential street jumps out

to the trunk retrieves a bottle of ACCELERANT

Opens the bottle DOUSES the interior of the car CHUCKS the
empty bottle inside withdraws a book of matches STRIKES

WHOOMP-- the FLAMES kick up rapidly--

Bomb races across a grassy lot to the street on the other
side PANTING under the weight of the bulging duffel--

While in the BACKGROUND-- KA-BLAM-- the Lincoln EXPLODES--
Bomb keeps on RUNNING his face hardening no more tears--
A POLICE CHOPPER roars past above him heading for the Storm

cUT TO BLACK

INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Patrick lies in a hospital bed his body wrapped in BANDAGES
with TUBES draining fluids his eyes dope-glazed

A bored UNIFORMED OFFICER sits in a chair in the corner
Hard RAIN pounds against the window

A muscular black MALE NURSE bends over Patrick checks the
the tubing Patrick’s eyes swim over to him

PATRICK
Rosalie (beat) My wife

The Nurse shakes his head offers a sad smile

MALE NURSE
No visitors allowed cuz It’s
bullshit but it is what it is

The Nurse lays a sympathetic hand on Patrick’s shoulder
leaves and Patrick’s eyes drift to the wall-mounted TVv--

Where a NEWSCAST is playing and a picture of BOMB fills the
screen-- in full DISGUISE-- his true face still UNKNOWN--

NEWSCASTER
-- assisting the FBI in the
nationwide search for an as-yet-
unidentified accomplice whom
authorities believe to be Robert
Hardaway also known as “Bomb” for
the South Bay armed bank robbery
that claimed the lives of two men
one of them a moonlighting off-duty
police officer

Patrick’s bleary eyes stutter closed as consciousness fades
PATRICK
Rosalie
EXT STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
RAIN pours from the sky unrelenting

The Hospital glows dimly in the background Find BOMB
crouched in the bushes soaking wet shivering

As the rain pelts him he watches the building that contains
his friend And then suddenly without a sound--

He’s gone

Patrick closes his eyes visibly deflates--
The sound of SOBBING and we see ROSALIE a few rows back

erying her eyes out she can’t stopand soon enough the
SWADDLED INFANT at her breast also starts WAILING LIKE HELL--

Patrick COVERS HIS EARS against the awful SOUND--

INT DOC BUS - DAY

The WAILING echoes over melting into the grim monotonous
HUM of an ENGINE--

Patrick sits at the rear of a TRANSPO BUS staring through a
window covered in a lattice of thick wire mesh--
EXT CONTAINER SHIP - OPEN OCEAN - SUNSET

A gigantic RED CARGO SHIP carrying 10000 TEU containers
churns through the rough black water at 20 knots

armored truck hops in the back and the door slams shut--

INT LOBBY - WELLS FARGO BRANCH
In the sunlit LOBBY at one of the DESKS--

A professorial-looking BLACK MAN-- moustache thick glasses
pudgy neck-- sits across from a pretty mid-30s WOMAN with a
blonde bob SHELLY MILLS Customer Service Manager

The Black Man is none other than BOBBY HARDAWAY fully
disguised unrecognizable to everyone but us

SHELLY

“Mr Dean” grins a shy grin adjusts his glasses

BOMB

SHELLY

BOMB
Absolutely Shelly And you can
call me Andrew Andy

Her face lights up

SHELLY
That’ll be easy to remember

BOMB
I know It’s also your son’s name

Her smile falters a moment

SHELLY
Oh (beat) I’m sorry what

Bomb pulls an IPHONE out of his pocket sets it on the desk
BOMB
We were talking about Andy His
favorite color is orange and his
favorite song is “Octopuses Garden”
by the Beatles It’s a Ringo tune

Shelly’s eyes flick to the iPhone The color drains from her
face She’s no longer smiling But Bomb sure is

BOMB
Relax Shelly

Bomb reclines backward in his seat and for just a moment we
see a GLINT OF STEEL-- a HANDGUN in a hidden HOLSTER--

BOMB
Breathe through the nose

You‘re goddamn right Shelly saw it too

INT FEDERAL BUILDING -— CONTINUOUS

We’re up on the 17th floor in the bustling FBI Los

Plant hurries down the hallway to a large OFFICE occupied by
BUREAU CHIEF SAMUEL ZORN 52 ginger hair glasses He’s in
the midst of paging through a thick DOSSIER

PLANT
There’s a window here sir It’s
not staying open for long

Zorn stares off tapping a pen against his forehead

ZORN
Jacob I like you You’re
tenacious Resourceful But we
can’t afford another Carmichael

and breakdown of follow-through--

Plant shuts his eyes seethes for a moment then leans close

PLANT

a long time ago I’m not green
anymore I’ve been waiting five
years to take Hardaway The
economy’s in the toilet People

Patrick chuckles amiably

PATRICK
Christ you’re an asshole You

Plant opens his dossier and slides a SECURITY-CAM STILL
across the table Patrick looks at it

PLANT
That’s six months ago Winston-

Patrick suddenly looks up Plant smirks

PLANT
Oh shit You didn’t know he was
atrapping for the job did you

own rules now Since the mentor
got himself locked up

Patrick frowns looks down at the picture

PATRICK
That’s a damned shame

PLANT
Your old man and your big brother
Johnny robbed a jewelry store guns
blazing They got shot to pieces
You were fifteen That’s why you
won’t touch steel (beat) Not so
bad with the research myself huh

Patrick grits his teeth keeps looking at the photo

get too close Too many moves

PLANT

Patrick snorts laughs

PATRICK

Let me explain something to you
Plant I happen to love that kid

He’s family To you he’s

an

animal a piece of shit you want to
lock in a cage Because over and
over again he makes you look like
a punk Just like the Carmichaels
He is your humiliation manifest
That’s why you want him so bad

Without him you’re over
Plant holds his poker face

PLANT

Wanna know what I see Gautreaux

I see an old broken man

rotting

away in a hole of piss A man who

sings the praises of love
family when we both know

those

things are finished for you
(beat) So who do you love more

Your little girl or that

thieving

prick who left you bleeding in the
street Who’s been stockpiling
millions while you run out your
clock with the scum of the scum

Patrick slowly nods defiant resign

PATRICK
I know the price of doing

nothing’s gonna change it

Plant leans forward on his elbows

Eyes blazing

PLANT

gonna spring your ass Then you’re
gonna get next to Hardaway You’re
gonna watch him feel him get
reacquainted and when the time’s

Patrick blinks

PATRICK

he’s planning something big And
after he’s done-- Poof Ghost-
ville And you’re never gonna have
this opportunity again

Patrick sits there He looks down at the STILLS He looks
up at Plant Abruptly he stands up walks to the door--

PLANT
You’re kidding me right You’re
gonna turn your back on this

Patrick BANGS on the door--

PATRICK
Guard

PLANT
Think about your family Your
blood

PLANT (contd)
Are you gonna make them suffer
their lives on the outside for all
the fucked-up things you’ve done

PATRICK
GUARD

PLANT
Is that the life you want for her

As the door opens and two CORRECTIONS OFFICERS enter
Patrick turns to Plant his eyes murderous

PATRICK
You don’t say ONE MORE WORD to me

Plant blinks Then his face hardens and he presses on--

PLANT
Women have needs convict How
long you think she’s gonna wait
around for you Living like a
goddamn nun No man in her bed to
wrap those long legs around make
her feel like a real--

And before Plant can finish Patrick crosses the room and
SMASHES HIM IN THE FACE so hard he FLIES off the bench--

PATRICK
Warned you--

The two burly C0s immediately BUM-RUSH Patrick DRAGGING
him away with their truncheons jammed up into his throat--

The door CLANGS shut Plant sits there alone on the floor

Through the blood in his teeth he manages a smile

INT HALLWAY - STATE COURTHOUSE —- DAY

The doors of a COURTROOM open and Patrick emerges into the
hallway in his prison jumpsuit hands and feet SHACKLED
escorted by two burly OFFICERS His expression is grim

He shuffles slowly down the hallway and suddenly FREEZES in
his tracks because ROSALIE is standing just ahead with 5-
year-old GIGI hiding her face in her mother’s hip

ROSALIE
What’s going on Why are you in
court again did something happen

The Guards stop shuffling Patrick along and they pause in
the hallway avert their eyes

PATRICK
I had a little scuffle But the
guy he’s Federal he’s being a
real hard-on about it and the
judge wants to mess with me

ROSALIE
What does that mean Patch

Patrick sighs looks into her eyes tries to look positive
PATRICK
They’re suspending my visitations
You won’t be able to come see me

But it’s only for a little spell
though it won’t he--

ROSALIE
How long is a little spell

BEAT

PATRICK
Eleven months

Rosalie stares at him frozen like she Just got slapped

PATRICK
It‘ll be okay We’ll get through--

Rosalie bursts into tears

PATRICK
Please don’t cry Ro

Now Gigi is crying too clinging tightly to Rosalie

PATRICK
Baby listen to me You gotta
trust me It’s gonna be alright

Rosalie stares at him angrily wiping at her leaking face

ROSALIE
It’s not alright This has never
been anything close to alright

PATRICK
I love you so much Rosalie
Please don’t give up on me

Rosalie cries some more covers her face When she looks at
him again in her eyes-- there’s a palpable emptiness

ROSALIE

What if I can’t take it Patch
It’s so hard Its so hard

Gigi has started to squirm tugging at Ro’s skirt

GIGI
Mommy I wanna go home

Rosalie tries to soothe her kisses her head--
ROSALIE
Sweetie it’s okay let’s give
Daddy a kiss--
But Gigi pushes her hand away--

GIGI
Wanna go home wanna go HOME

PATRICK
Hey Cookie look at me--

But it’s no use Gigi is now fully melting down--
GIGI
MOMMY I WANNA GO HOME PLEASE MOMMY
PLEASE I WANNA GO--

The GUARDS holding Patrick stare at the floor uncomfortable
and embarrassed by the scene

PATRICK
Gigi you’re my girl--

By now Gigi is SCREAMING HER HEAD OFF inconsolable and
Rosalie looks at Patrick helplessly--

ROSALIE
I have to take her now--

Rosalie picks up Gigi who clings to her tightly--

PATRICK
I’m sorry I’m sorry hey--

--and they both fade away down the hall

PATRICK
Wait Ro (beat) Wait

within seconds his long skinny arm has snaked into the gap--

backpack spread across the passenger seat

He’s bent under the steering wheel the column popped open
His fingers move quickly STRIPPING the exposed WIRES

TAP-TAP-TAP

Bobby immediately POPS UP from under the wheel Sees a MAN
standing right outside the car window inches away

The Man is PATRICK GAUTREAUX Mid-30s He grins bemused

PATRICK
Christ you’re a quick one

Bobby’s eyes POP OUT and he shimmies to the opposite side
JUMPS out the passenger door--

And is immediately GRABBED by another MAN pale skinned
thickly built named DORCHESTER 40

Bobby STRUGGLES and WRIGGLES and suddenly he pulls a PISTOL
out of his jacket--

But Dorchester easily SWATS the gun away SLAMS the boy
against the car PINS him there draws back his large PFIST--

PATRICK (0S)

Bobby shakes his head frowns

BOBBY

Patrick taps his finger against Bobby’s HEAD--

PATRICK

Patrick grins cocks his head

PATRICK

He leans closer to Bobby and whispers--

PATRICK

INT BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Patrick enters the shop into a blue haze of blunt-smoke A
BELL JANGLES above the door

Instantaneously ALL EYES are on him The MEN inside-- three
BARBERS and eight “CUSTOMERS”-- are straight-up HGRC BANGERS
Ink scars thousand-yard-stares

Still Patrick smiles a toothy cheerful grin
PATRICK
The answer is no I actually don’t

A linebacker-built BARBER calmly approaches
BIG BARBER

The dudes in the shop start CAT-CALLING at Patrick

PATRICK
All of you pipe the fuck down

The Big Barber actually stops in his tracks wearing an
expression like what the FUCK did you just say

PATRICK
I need to get a word to Bobby-Bomb

At the mention of the name a HUSH falls across the shop

BIG BARBER
You say you ain’t the po-lice

The Big Barber grins and it’s not heartwarming

BIG BARBER
Then I’m a’ put you to sleep cuz

The Barber RUSHES him but Patrick doesn’t wait for the
swing He KICKS him so fucking hard in the balls the big
dude’s eyes go CROSSED--

Before the Big Barber hits the floor Patrick’s already
GRABBED a super-sharp pair of SHEARS from a blue jar of
BARBICIDE which he holds out prison-style like a shank

But that doesn’t stop TWO BANGERS from rushing RIGHT AT HIM
from BOTH SIDES--

Patrick SPINS and JAMS the SCISSORS deep into Banger One’s
THIGH and homeboy SCREAMS--

Just as the other Banger Two SMASHES his fist into the side
of Patrick’s head KNOCKING him sideways against the WALL--

Patrick still manages to grab that glass jar full of
BARBICIDE and he SMASHES the JAR against his assailant’s HEAD
and the BLUE LIQUID goes SPLATTERING along with the BLOOD--

Now EVERYONE is out of their chairs RUSHING the entrance
and several BIG DUDES start PILING on top of Patrick
throwing wild HAYMAKERS--

The BELL JANGLES over the door--

AGENT POE slips inside UNSEEN and she’s got BRASS KNUCKLES
on her LEFT FIST and a LEATHER SAP in her RIGHT--

A tall lanky BANGER strides toward her gets one word out--

LANKY BANGER
Bitch--

THWAP-THWAP-- Poe NAILS him TWICE in the HEAD with the SAP
and the BANGER DROPS to the FLOOR--

And then she SETS UPON the PILE OF DUDES on top of Patrick
WHACKING them mercilessly with the SAP and sending quick
deadly PUNCHES with the KNUCKLES--

SMASHING all the TENDER SPOTS-- KNEES and ELBOWS and
COLLARBONES-- every fierce IMPACT hitting its mark perfectly
until the dudes are HOWLING in pain trying to get away from
her but she keeps coming-- WHACK WHACK WHACK WHACK--

Holy shit this lady has some moves--

Poe HAULS a dazed banged-up Patrick to his feet DRAGS him
toward the DOOR--

CLACK-CLACK Everyone FREEZES because the big BARBER is
pointing a SHOTGUN straight at Patrick and Poe chest
heaving eyes murderous

Poe stares back at him baring her teeth clenching her fist
around the smeared bloodied KNUCKLES--

Patrick leans toward Poe whispers to her--
PATRICK

Never thought I’d get us killed

CLUNK-- Poe’s KNUCKLES hit the floor and now she’s pointing
a big silver HandK 44 dead-center at the Big Barber’s GROIN

POE
I will make you a girl see

Barber’s eyes BUG and he TIGHTENS his grip on the GAUGE--

The BANGERS are peeling themselves off the floor forming a
tight semi-circle the stink of anger in the air--

VOICE (0S)
All y’all back the fuck up

It’s like all the air just leaked out of the room The
Bangers retreat cowed their weapons disappear back into
pockets and waistbands and Timbs

The area clears revealing an imposing black man in a
WHEELCHAIR This is ROPE 40 rocking a 4-inch-deep afro
temples flecked with gray

His arms shoulders and chest are thick with muscle but his
legs are thin wasted-- he’s PARALYZED from the waist-down

hard all power all confidence

EXT ELYSIAN PARK - SUNSET

The TAHOE winds its way through the quiet desolate hills of
Elysian Park At a small turn-off Patrick climbs out

He picks his way down a steep incline to the flat mesa of
ANGELS POINT dominated by a large 80s-era SCULPTURE now
completely covered in TAGS

Poe hangs in the background keeping her distance but
watching with hawk-like focus

That’s when BOMB steps out from behind one of the wide
PILLARS of the sculpture Dodger cap Dodger satin jacket
stone-washed jeans glasses-- a tourist dork

And for a few moments they simply look at each other

BOMB
Imagine my surprise

PATRICK

Sometimes I take the world and
sometimes I make the world

BOMB
Why you wanna waste your money on
that bullshit

PATRICK
Because that’s how it’s done You
don’t get to be as good as me
without understanding the ways of
the universe Trying to make the
world a little nicer a little less
fucked-up-- that isn’t bullshit
On the contrary I’d say it’s
goddamn essential

Bobby thinks about it awhile clocks the street Sees a
tall awkward tailored MAN walking holding a bulky mid-90s
cell phone checking his watch glancing into shop windows

BOBBY

distracted Walk like a bitch

Patrick chuckles shakes his head

PATRICK

PATRICK
Your eyes are good but that mouth
is a major problem You keep
talking like a Crip you’re
worthless to me I don’t know

Bobby glares at Patrick a cold gangsta mad-dog But then
his face changesslackens relaxes

And when he speaks he suddenly sounds white as gsnow--

BOBBY
I apologize Sir I understand
that most people are leery of
African-Americans and that by
exacerbating the nigger issue I
might foul-up a lucrative business
opportunity

Up front Dorchester stifles a laugh Patrick grins at
Bobby eyes gleaming

Patrick’s legs out from under him They WRESTLE and STRUGGLE
their way across the floor throwing FISTS and ELBOWS--

Theyre both skilled scrappers-- but Bomb is younger faster

Patrick falls against the wall dazed as Bomb grabs the
Glock and POINTS it at his heart eyes burning--

But Patrick just picks himself up and walks right up to the
gun so his chest is touching the barrel

Pleasure’s been all mine Dr
Hodge All mine

Bomb steps out of the car hands raised above his head and a
few moments later Patrick does the same

Almost instantly the two men are SWARMED by the Feds who
shove them up against the car frisk them roughly

A Fed moves to the trunk of the Volvo pops it finds the
Duffels inside unzips one of them and the tightly-packed
bundles of cash almost burst through the opening--

The Fed grins stuffs the cash back in zips it back up
alams the trunk closed whips out a walkie--

FED

The gate swings open and the convoy of vehicles winds its
way up tothe top and everyone climbs out

Patrick rolls the kinks out of his neck glances up the steep
embankment at the headlights zipping along Mulholland--

Let’‘s go old-timer--

The Fed shoves Patrick forward toward the front door--

INT HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - FOYER

Patrick and Bomb are ushered inside where they’re greeted by
a grinning PLANT his head gleaming as if freshly polished

PLANT
Welcome home friends

Patrick stares at the sweaty jittery Federal Agent notes
the decidedly strange look on his face

PATRICK
You alright Agent Plant

Plant turns to Bomb Sizes him up like a prized pig
PLANT
Bobby-Bomb Hardaway As I live and
breathe Now I’ve got you

Plant STARES openly aggressively at Bomb who frowns looks
away creeped-out exposed
BOMB
Congratulations

Plant steps forward cocks his head leans close to Bomb

PLANT
You’re not tough at all are you
Just a skinny little piece of
Inglewood trash who likes to steal
and play dress-up

Bomb wrinkles up his nose grimaces

BOMB
Ever brush your teeth Your breath
stink like grandmama pussy

Patrick snorts Plant bristles nods to Kiyoshi--

PLANT
Take him to the library

INT HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - BEDROOM

Patrick walks down the hall toward the BEDROOM door but
atops short when he sees AGENT POE sitting in a chair outside
the door typing into her laptop

PATRICK
God damn Althea It’s good to see
you I thought--

POE
Got nothing to say to you

He steps closer cautiously

PATRICK
I’m sure you find me despicable
And you’re right to But you have
to believe I didn’t know any of
those moves were gonna happen

Finally she looks up at him Her face is colder than cold

POE
I’m the despicable one for failing
at my job I don’t feel nothin at
all for a dirty low-down lying
convict thief like you

Patrick nods accepts it He bends close to her speaks low
PATRICK
You didn’t fail Youre one of the
sickest operators I’ve ever seen
ZIii never forget Another life
we would’ ve been on the same side

Patrick goes into the bedroom Poe frowns rubs her sore
chest closes the laptop Rises to her feet

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Patrick enters and finds Rosalie sitting in an easy chair
with Gigi asleep in her lap

Rosalie looks at him with tired strained eyes He bends
down kisses her softly careful not to wake Gigi

ROSALIE

Patrick checks his watch then walks to the window looks
outside to the Courtyard sees the DOZEN FEDS milling about
keeping watch Then he returns to Rosalie

PATRICK
Not yet baby But soon (beat)
Everything you need put it ina

Rosalie’s eyes widen He reaches down for Gigi picks her
up and she lets out a little moan nestles into him--

EXT LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

A HUGE PETERBILT 18-WHEEL SEMI is GROANING and RUMBLING as it
makes its way up the steep winding grade

We see that it’s Berto behind the wheel The Semi passes the
Lookout Mountain turnoff rumbles on up the hill--

INT HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Bomb is slumped in a chair looking dejected while Plant
stands across from him Kiyoshi lingers in the corner

PLANT
You really expect me to believe it
was all your idea And Gautreaux
had no idea you were gonna hit the
Union Trust
BOMB
Believe whatever the fuck you want

PLANT
You don’t have the manpower or the
mind-power to make that happen

Bombs smiles checks his watch shakes his head

BOMB
What because I’m a piece of
Inglewood trash We got ourselves
a Black President Feeble Got
more mind-power than you think
Besides you don’t have anything on
me do you You got some kinda
proof of my hands on the paper
Course you don’t Because I never
touched the paper I’ve read your
files Plant I know everything
about you Back in my set we’d
call someone like you a Buster
All talk but no heart Your boss
don’t trust you He knows what you
are Because you fucked up the
Carmichael sting and they got away
clean Everybody in the Game
knows We all sit around and laugh
about that shit

Plant crosses his arms stares at Bomb like a specimen

PLANT
You laugh do you

BOMB
Course we do Buster

Plant just stares and something’s definitely not right
because his gaze seemsbroken Like a circuit just blew

PLANT
You know what I think you might
not live through the night
Bomb laughs but unsteadily not sure he heard right--

BOMB
Hell you just say

But Plant just continues to STARE Kiyoshi shifts around
disconcerted also not sure he heard correctly--

Patrick with Gigi in his arms emerges from the bedroom into

toward the door to the LIBRARY--

She can hear Plant’s VOICE coming from inside she quietly
slips through the door--
EXT MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
The PETERBILT winds along the treacherous hairpins of
Mulholland cars have to SQUEEZE around it because it almost
takes up the entire road--
The sound of hydraulics HISSING as the semi slows down
approaching a wide dirt turnout that faces South--
INT HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIBRARY
Bomb and Plant still facing off--
PLANT
Do you want to hear how it
happened Bobby-Bomb

Bomb’s eyes dart to the window back to Plant nervous--

BOMB
How what happened

Plant pulls out his Smith and Wesson Barrel to the floor
PLANT
How you died silly goose Haven’‘t
you been paying attention

Bomb freezes eyeballing the Piece
PLANT
Kiyoshi please draw your weapon

Kiyoshi nonplussed does as he’s told pulls out his Glock
PLANT
Anyway it was just so awful I
was careless and you moved so
quickly like like a panther
Plant casually picks up a PILLOW from the couch--
PLANT
And when you went for my weapon
and shot Agent Kiyoshi in the face
all I could do was watch in horror--

Kiyoshi almost laughs until he sees Plant RAISING HIS PISTOL

KIYOSHI
Boss hey--

In one quick motion Plant PUSHES THE PILLOW against
KIYOSHI’S FACE and jams the BARREL against the pillow--

BOMB
FUCK DON’ T--

--And FIRES The GUNSHOT is MUFFLED by the pillow just a
hollow POP and KIYOSHI CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR--

A sharp GASP off-screen and Plant turns to see POE STANDING

bookshelf just as he FIRES--

PLANT
But to turn out your lights--

Plant pushes the BARREL into Bomb’s EYE--

BOMB

And from outside a RUMBLING a VIBRATION that quickly grows
STRONGER and LOUDER--
INT HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

The RUMBLING growing louder still as one of the Feds checks
the closed circuit screens--

The driveway is clean The front door is clean

But the courtyard screen is FILLED WITH THE GIGANTIC SEMI
HURTLING DOWN THE EMBANKMENT--

TWENTY TONS OF STEEL MONSTER coming CRASHING DOWN into them--
The Feds SCATTER and some get out of the way some DON’T--
The Semi SMASHES HEADLONG INTO THE HOUSE--

CAVING IN THE WALLS SHAKING the ENTIRE STRUCTURE to its
FOUNDATION the SOUND is DEAFENING--

In the LIBRARY PLANT and BOMB are THROWN across the ROOM as
the WALLS RUPTURE and the CEILING IMPLODES--

In the HALLWAY Rosalie and Gigi SCREAM as the HOUSE SHAKES
and PIECES OF CEILING RAIN DOWN but they land crumbling on
PATRICK’S BACK as he SHIELDS THEM--

In the LIVING ROOM the SEMI CAB PUNCHES SIDEWAYS THROUGH the
WALLS finally coming to rest in the middle of the ROOM--

The Cab HISSES and FLUIDS LEAK and SPURT from the WRECKAGE--

PATRICK quickly gathers up his girls who are so SHAKEN they
can’t even SCREAM anymore-- he HUSTLES them through the
WRECKAGE of the house to where the Front Door used to be--

He passes by the wreckage of the LIBRARY where BOMB is
CRAWLING OUT from under heavy chunks of CEILING--

PATRICK
Quickly now quickly--

The FLUIDS from the mangled Semi suddenly CATCH FIRE and the
FLAMES LICK HUNGRILY along the floor and ceiling--

Patrick moves to Bomb FLINGS chunks of plaster off his back
HAULS Bomb to his feet guides everyone toward the outside
circumventing the growing FLAMES--

into the back next to them--

Patrick turns to see PLANT approaching BLOOD trickling down
his face into his EYES aiming his PISTOL--
PLANT

Patrick instantly WRAPS HIMSELF around Gigi--

POE You DO NOT do that Sir

POE EMERGES from the DARKNESS and SPIN-KICKS the PISTOL right
out of Plant’s hands--

POE

WHAP--WHAP--WHAP--WHAP She unleashes a FLURRY of KICKS to
Plant’s CRANIUM and a final VICIOUS PUNCH to his solar
plexus KNOCKS him to the ground he GASPS for air--

Patrick gapes at her stunned and grateful--
POE

Wheel so point the way

Patrick slides into the passenger seat Poe gets behind the
wheel starts her up--

POE
Everybody get low--

As Poe SCREECHES down the Driveway sure enough some FEDS
start FIRING at them--

And from within the wrecked house the SEMI SUDDENLY EXPLODES
in a MASSIVE FIREBALL--

BLOWING some FEDS off their feet while others are piling
into the SUV’s preparing to GIVE CHASE--

As the TAHOE BARRELS down the Driveway doesn’t slow for the
GATE instead SMASHES RIGHT THROUGH IT--

The THREE SUV’s PEEL OUT down the DRIVEWAY in close PURSUIT--

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Plant rubbing his sore chest limps over to the VOLVO and
pops the trunk Inside the DUFFELS He UNZIPS one of them
ALL THE WAY OPEN and sees that the CASH is nothing but a
THIN OUTER LAYER covering BULLSHIT STACKS of COPY PAPER
His expression is oddly calm even though he’s battered
bruised face full of blood

PLANT
Oh yes Of course Yes

He UNZIPS the SECOND DUFFEL It’s the EXACT SAME THING
Oddly Plant starts to CHUCKLE It’s very unpleasant

He walks slowly over to the GUEST COTTAGE

But HORNS BLARE as the PICKUP SLAMS on its BRAKES--

retracts as the ship slowly STEAMS away from the dock

On the way she passes by the HGRC BANGERS who are DRAGGING
AGENT PLANT across the pavement toward a cluster of CARS
Plant makes desperate EYE CONTACT with her as he’s DRAGGED--
