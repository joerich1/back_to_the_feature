FADE IN
EXT A MEDIEVAL ABBEY - MOONLIT NIGHT

On a hilltop dominating the surrounding lands a large abbey
stands fortress-like against a moonlit sky

A TITLE APPEARS FRANCE 1095

The silhouette of a horseman suddenly appears and pauses in the
foreground The man’s strong features are etched by moonlight
His name is HAGEN and a peasant’s cloak hides his large muscular
build As the singing of vespers drifts on the wind from the
abbey Hagen’s face spreads in a toothy grin Touching heels

to his mare’s flanks he gallops towards the abbey

INT THE ABBEY’S SANCTUARY - NIGHT

Beneath Gothic arches a monk’s choir shifts from the melodic
vespers to a strange chant similar to the “Carmina Burana” and
a procession appears

THE PROCESSION

is led by youthful ACOLYTES swinging golden censers that fill
the air with the heavy incense Six castrati sopranos follow
them leading the way for a portly ABBOT in a bishop’s miter
and vestments of crimson and gold He is surrounded by
adolescent NOVICES who bear candles and tend his train A
CHOIR OF MONKS follows led by an AGED MONK who holds a tall
staff surmounted by a large gold cross

THE CROSS APPEARS TO FLOAT ABOVE THE PROCESSION

through swirling clouds of incense smoke against a flaming
background of countless candles that suggest the devastated
landscape of a holocaust

THE MAIN TITLE APPEARS CRUSADE

TITLES CONTINUE OVER

EXT THE ABBEY WALL - NIGHT

Hagen rides a path at the base of the wall peering up at the
unscalable heights Occasionally he sniffs the air as if
following a scent Detecting something he brightens at the
sight of--

A HUGE PILE

of bones and rotting entrails which lies below an opening high
above in the abbey wall

HAGEN LOOKS UP

reacting to a sound
FROM AN OPENING HIGH ABOVE

in the wall a cartload of bones and viscera are dumped by two
peasants

HAGEN CALMS

his horse and eases her into the shadows When the peasants
disappear he slips off and removes a three-pronged hook and
a length of rope from a saddle bag

HAGEN
(to his horse)
Be good and I’ll bring you
carrots

The mare nickers and nods “Yes” as Hagen moves under th

opening Swinging the hook he heaves it up
THE HOOK CATCHES

on the timbers of the opening wall

HAGEN TESTS THE LINE

then pulls himself up hand over hand

INT THE ABBOTTS CHAMBERS - NIGHT

In a high-domed room hung with elaborate brocade a lutist and
pan-piper player render a romantic fantasia while facing the
wall At a curtained bed the Abbot raises his arms to allow

a teenaged BLOND ACOLYTE to remove his outer vestments In lace
undergarments he settles on the bed Extending a pale hand

the Abbot strokes the head of a DARK HAIRED ACOLYTE who removes
his slippers The blond youth suddenly grabs the Abbots hand
and kisses it

ABBOT
(smiling)
Oh are we jealous

The Abbot hugs them close relishing the feel of their young
bodies

ABBOT
I promise each will have a gift

The dark haired youth turns away and begins a -seductive belly
dance clapping his hands and slapping the bare soles of his
feet on the stone floor in time with the music The Abbot
giggles with delight

EXTINT THE ABBEY SLAUGHTER HOUSE - NIGHT

Hagen grabs a filthy beam and pulls himself through the opening
in the abbey wall into the slaughterhouse
Moving past hanging carcasses and tubs of entrails he enters
a huge pantry and sneaks past two PEASANTS stuffing sausage
in the gloom of a curing room

EXT THE ABBEY COURTYARD - NIGHT

Under the eaves of a huge inner courtyard Hagen ducks into the
shadows as an abbey GUARD emerges from a doorway to relieve
himself with a piss and a long sustained fart

Hagen sneaks past a mess room door where other GUARDS are
drinking There is laughter as one squirts wine from a wine
skin into the face of a ragged prostitute

Pausing at a doorway of a main building Hagen makes a mental
note of his position then enters and descends a flight of
stairs

INT THE ABBOT’S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Wearing a silken shift the Abbot carefully paints the lips of
the blond acolyte while the other already rouged looks on with
a pout When finished the Abbot draws back for a taste of wine
and an appraisal of his work

ABBOT
But the princesses need jewels

Both acolytes smile
ABBOT
Yes that suits you Doesn’t it
my little sluts
The Abbot chucks their cheeks and crosses to the door
INT ABBEY HALLWAY - NIGHT

A NOVICE MONK sleeping on straw outside the Abbot’s door
scrambles to his feet as the Abbot appears

ABBOT

Summon Monfleurry Tell him I

need something from the vault
The novice hurries away down the hall
INT THE VAULT STAIRWAY - NIGHT
Hagen carrying a small torch descends a stairway to a heavily
bolted door - He removes a pry-bar from his belt inserts it
in the lock and pushes until the lock tears from the wood
Hagen peers inside
INT HALLWAY AND TREASURE ROOM NIGHT

At the far end of a hallway Hagen’s torch illuminates the
Abbeys wealth stored behind the bars of a treasure room
HAGEN

steps to the barred door inserts his pry-bar and heaves The
door is unlocked Hagen driven by his own force hurtles
through and crashes amidst the treasure Laying atop piles of
silver and gold jewelled chalices and icons he glances around
Snatching a gold crucifix he kisses it irreverently and
laughingly stuffs it into his bag

stare dumbly from the doorway

HAGEN
(shouting)
Where are the carrots

A peasant points Hagen pulls carrots from a sack and stuffs
them in his shirt as--

A GUARD

with a crossbow appears pushing past the peasants he shouts
as he aims

GUARD
He‘s here
A bolt buries itself in a pork loin beside Hagen’s face Two
other GUARDS rush Hagen with pikes He yanks a pig carcass from

Hagen drops fifteen feet onto the horses back The mare lunges
away as a bolt from another crossbow whistles past

EXT THE ABBEY ENTRANCE - PRE-DAWN

Bells shatter the pre-dawn silence as Hagen rounds the abbey
walls at a gallop

THE ABBEY’S MAIN GATE BURSTS OPEN

A pack of hounds followed by a squad of mounted guards charge
out in pursuit

EXT A MIST ENSHROUDED FOREST - DAWN
A SERIES OF SHOTS

Hagen gallops through swirls of mist swinging from side to
side ducking the low branches of trees

The dogs are hot on his scent plunging blindly through the
thick undergrowth

Hagen jumps a fallen log As he vanishes into the mist the
dogs scurry under it in pursuit

At a steep ravine Hagen senses the dogs are gaining He spurs
the mare down an embankment into a stream Hagen looks in one
direction then the other straining to see through the mist
Spurring his horse up stream he sees--

Four mounted GUARDS emerging from the mist ahead cutting him
off

Ready to carve his way through them Hagen draws a huge sword
The guards rein up and none will engage Hagen They shout and
yodel their position to others as the dogs race up

As Hagen tries to drive through the dogs eight more GUARDS
appear from the mist His horse panics rears and falls over
backwards Hagen lands hard in the stream and his sword
clatters away among the rocks As he struggles to his feet the
dogs tear at him with a frenzy

A mounted GUARD tries to hook Hagen with his pike Hagen grabs
the man’s leg snatches him off his horse and heaves him into
the pack of dogs

Other guards dismount and encircle Hagen They prod him with
their pikes while the dogs resume their attack

The BAILIFF a large man almost a big as Hagen and a SERGEANT
OF THE GUARD move in When the mastiffs have pulled Hagen down
the men beat him with cudgels Hagen tries to rise the carrots
spill from his torn shirt Struck repeatedly he falls
senseless into the stream

EXT THE ABBEY COURTYARD - DAY

Surrounded by his captors Hagen with his arms tied over a
yoke is prodded through the gate of the abbey into the
courtyard The Bailiff rides behind moving him with his pike

BAILIFF
On your knees

Hagen glares at the Bailiff A guard strikes his leg with a
cudgel dropping him to his knees

THE ABBOT

appears with Monfleurry Guards place the sack and the
recovered loot near Hagen for their inspection

BAILIFF
All has been recovered your
grace

The Abbot says nothing as he walks around Hagen who stares
ahead in silence The Abbot studies the huge muscles of Hagen’s
arms resisting the temptation to caress them Looking into
Hagen’s face the Abbot smiles with recognition

MONFLEURRY
You know this man

“The Abbot continues staring at Hagen

ABBOT
Summon Count Emmich of Bascarat

Hagen turns and faces the Abbot The name has brought rage to
his expression
EXT A PEACEFUL VALLEY - DAY

The scene could be the backdrop of an old master’s painting
Through a summer haze a small river winds past fields bordered
by slopes festooned with grape vines The landowner’s home is
a large farmhouse partially in ruins that stands on a hill amid
a cluster of trees A scream rude laughter and the cackling
of chickens and geese is heard from the distance

EXT THE FARMYARD - DAY

A peasant girl stumbles from a thicket and runs through a junk
strewn farmyard Chickens and ducks scatter as she flees a
nude well-muscled man whose body and shoulder-length hair are
dyed Burgundy red COUNT EMMICH OF BASCARAT wild-eyed lust-
crazed like a satyr from a Greek myth he chases the girl
toward a row of huge vats where the MEN OF HIS GUARD and a
handful of PEASANTS are stomping grapes

He corners her against a stone wall and grabs her She fights
him as he drags her toward the vats

His men howl with laughter as Emmich tears the girl’s clothes
away Her screams are beyond the mock protest of ribald play
Her youth she is no more than fifteen is sadly apparent as
she pleads with him With sudden anger he smacks her tips her
into a vat and climbs in after her

IN THE VAT

the girl slick with grape slime lunges away from Emmich
Grabbing her by the hair he plunges her head under slurry and
holds it there looking around as though he’s lost her

EMMICH
Where did she go

The men now roar with laughter at Emmich’s charade Holding
her head under he shields his eyes with his hand and pretends
to look out at the landscape

EMMICH
Vanished

More laughter which Emmich milks then he pulls her up The
girl chokes and gags for air Emmich draws her close smiling
into her face

EMMICH

Be willing now I’m bored of the
chase

The girl faces him resigned Aroused by her broken spirit
Emmich pushes her to the side of the vat and begins taking his
pleasure As he works into her
HIS MEN WATCH

Ivo a pale young man with a cruel face stifles an attack of
giggles

EXT THE VAT - DAY

Emmich climaxes with a roar like a rutting elephant Shoving
the girl away he raises both hands above his head and shouts
to his men

EMMICH
I declare this vintage well
seasoned

A RIDER

Emmich’s cousin WALDEMAR large and gross featured enters the
farmyard at a gallop and reins his horse near the vats As
he swings from the saddle Emmich greets him

EMMICH
Waldemar strip your rags and
climb in Im drunk enough to
share this sowlet

Emmich grabs the girl and displays her as Waldemar approaches

WALDEMAR
Another time Emmich You are
called to abbey

EMMICH
Called from my gentle home life
for what reason

WALDEMAR
(grins)
Your wayward serf Hagen is in the
abbey’s dungeon accused of
robbing the vaults

Emmich’s lips trace a cold smile

EMMICH
£0r which they will hang him

INT ABBEY HALLWAY - DAY

Emmich‘s clothes are dirty and ragged He appears shabby as
he walks beside the immaculately groomed Abbot

ABBOT
I summoned you Count Emmich
because there is more to this than
the simple capture and trial of
a serf turned thief
Emmich glances at he Abbot annoyed

EMMICH
He abandoned my service for
brigandage I‘m not involved
Hang him

ABBOT

A tribunal might find this man
other than a serf They might
find him a man deprived of his
inheritance and therefore driven
to thievery They mightwith
due considerationeven find
him guiltless

Emmich stiffens at the Abbots words They pause at a large
cage of doves The Abbot coos to the birds feeding them as he

continues

ABBOT

Do you forget that I was your
father’s confessor

EMMICH
Then you know there were other
bastards beside this one

ABBOT
The other bastards he ordered
killedFor the others he felt
no “affection” But he spoke of
legitimizing this Hagen

EMMICH
I don’t need reminding of my
father’s weakness for this son
of a peasant whore Are you
saying you won’t hang him

ABBOT
There is a document signed before
your father’s death that would
give Hagen claim to half of your
estate It is in my possession

Emmich blanches slightly The Abbot turns from the doves at

the ringing of a distant bell

ABBOT
The call to vespers

The Abbot studies Emmich enjoying this moment of power

is barely able to control his rage

EMMICH
What do you want

Emmich
ABBOT
Deed to me one quarter of your

estateAnd I will hang your
bastard brother

EMMICH
You dirty old
ABBOT
(as to an errant child)
Ah ah ahCareful now Count

Emmich Better to give quarter
than lose all

Emmich faces the Abbot His mouth dry with rage

EMMICH
(a beat)
Summon your scribe

INT THE ABBEY’S MAIN HALL - DAY

Hagen is led in with his wrists and neck chained He reacts
immediately to the sight of Emmich seated casually on the front
bench of a pew Emmichs smug smile contrasts with Hagen’s cold
hatred at the sight of his half brother The Abbot stands
before a row of CLERICS wearing black robes of judgement Hagen
is forced to stand in the middle of the tribunal where he is
flanked by the bailiff and guards

ABBOT
The man before this tribunal is
Hagen a serf from lands owned
by Count Emmich of Bascarat
Count Emmich deo you hold this
man as your property

The Abbot turns to face Emmich

EMMICH
No I resign him to your
judgement
ABBOT
(graciously)

And we make no claim on you for
his actions

Emmich nods a stiff acknowledgement The Abbot faces Hagen

ABBOT
You were a pikesman in the guard
of Count Emmich Can you tell
us why you renounced your duties
and became a thief Were you
influenced by a demon

HAGEN
I was influenced only by Count
Emmich

EMMICH

You dare incriminate me

HAGEN
As your pikesman I stole grain
from villagers and robbed
travelers on the road By your
order I learned theft like all
your men

EMMICH
He speaks of collecting taxes and
tithes for crossing my
landsall within the law

HAGEN
Since there’s so much stealing
within the law how does a man
know what’s outside the law

ABBOT
Robbing this house of God cannot
be compared with the duties of
serfdom

HAGEN
I don’t compare them
(an odd smile)
Robbing this abbey was something
I enjoyed

ABBOT
(a beat he smiles too)
And judging you is something Ill
enjoy

Hagen watches as the Abbot moves along the row of black robed
monks Whispers are exchanged and each nods a gesture of
accord The Abbot turns and faces Hagen With theatrically
raised eyebrows he speaks as though the verdict were a
surprise

ABBOT
Hagen this tribunal has found
you guilty

Emmich allows himself a laugh The Abbot continues with barely
concealed sarcasm

ABBOT
But I am ordained by a merciful
god and the sentence of death may
not pass my lips Duty obliges
me to pray for your redemption

Hagen appears momentarily confused thinking he may have been
granted a reprieve The Abbot kneels before a small altar and
intones in Latin

Suddenly the guards jerk Hagen to his feet He faces the
bailif£

BAILIFF
Hagen I am the lay bailiff of
this Abbey I condemn you to hang
for the crime of theft

As Hagen is hauled towards the door Emmich watches with a degree
of grudging satisfaction

INT THE ABBEYS PRISON - DAY

Hagen sits at a cell window overlooking the courtyard His neck
is chained to a ring in the wall The ravings of an unseen
MADMAN can be heard off screen

POV HAGEN

Workers are building a scaffold Nearby the Bailiff and the
Sergeant of the guard look on as two SERFS wash Hagen’s mare
with a bucket of raw egg shampoo The Bailiff takes the mare’s
halter obviously claiming the horse for his own

HAGEN WATCHES

annoyed that his horse will pass to the Bailiff’s hands He
whistles

POV HAGEN

The mare whinnies rears and kicks out at the Bailiff As the
Bailiff jumps back his foot lands in the bucket of egg-shampoo
He stomps around and falls on his ass as the Serfs calm the
horse

HAGEN LAUGHS
HAGEN
Dont worry girl TI havent
forgotten your carrots

He starts to turn away when he hears a herald’s trumpet and hoof
eats

POV HAGEN

Five horsemen gallop into the courtyard One is well-attired
an obvious noble The others members of his personal body
guard wear chain mail and helmets

HAGEN WATCHES AS

the noble dismounts at the entrance to the Abbots quarters
After speaking with some monks who bow to him deferentially
he is led inside

INT THE ABBOTS OFFICES - DAY

PRINCE ORSINI a lay delegate of the Vatican reclines ina
chair eating a snack from a gold plate as he speaks in clipped
directives with the Abbot Monfleurry sits in the background

ABBOT
I heard that his Holiness was in
Clermont but I had no idea he
would honor us with a visit

ORSINI
He will reside here in the Abbey
ABBOT
Of course In my own apartments
ORSINI
He will require a field be
prepared
ABBOT
A field
ORSINI

A call must be put forth to gather
both nobles and commonfolk to a
large field There you will erect
a platform from which he can
address the multitude

The Abbot exchanges a look with Monfleurry Orsini rises and
walks to a window The hammering from the gallows can be heard

ABBOT
(probing)
The message our Pope bringsI
assume it’s of great importance

Orsini is looking out the window toward the gallows

ORSINI
Yes but I will not usurp his
words with my ownThat scaffold
down there must be struck
immediately

ABBOT
But we have an execution A thief
attempted to rob the Abbey

ORSINI
Strike the scaffold After his
Holiness leaves hang anyone you
want

INT THE CELL - DUSK

Hagen chins himself on the bars of his cell When he has
finished a set he relaxes for a beat then responds to a
different sound off screen The unmistakable sound of nails
being pulled from wood He crosses to the window and sees

POV HAGEN

The scaffold in being torn down

HAGEN

dares reflect cautious pleasure at the sight
EXT THE ABBEY LANDSCAPE - DAY

The road to the Abbey is filled with color as a Papal caravan
approaches lead by a mounted guard of armored knights A large
ornate coach drawn by oxen and bearing the Papal seal moves
slowly at the center followed by carts of baggage a hundred
or more members of the Pope’s entourage and an army of monks

AS THE CARAVAN

reaches a large field near the abbey a tent city can be seen
People of all classes crowd forward to view his wagon

Milkmaids stare wide-eyed Nobles and Knights shove rudely
through the crowd to bow their heads Elderly peasant women
kneel and cross themselves A collective gasp goes up as--

A CURTAIN PARTS

and for a brief instant POPE URBAN II can be seen A bearded
authoritative looking man the Pope motions a blessing then
retires from sight

SLACK-JAWED’ SERFS STARE IN WONDER

as monks and ascetics prostrate themselves in the mud beside
the road A group of flagellants pass swatting themselves with
chains at every step as they keep pace with the caravan

THE PAPAL COACH RATTLES

past Emmich and a group of his peers Local nobility they are
a shabby lot Their clothes are filthy and their hair unkempt
One restrains a pair of coursing hounds another holds a hooded
goshawk Peasant gamekeepers stand behind them festooned with
dead pheasants ducks rabbits and the flayed skins of deer
Emmichs atténtion is drawn to a knight who rides beside the
Papal Coach

The brilliance of his armor the magnificence of his mount and
his regal bearing suggest he is someone of great importance
He is COUNT GODFREY OF BOUILLON

Emmich standing among his shabby entourage watches him pass
EXT A MARKET AREA - DAY

Stalls where merchants sell religious trinkets have been
hastily erected near the road A young man with dark
Mediterranean looks observes people frantically crossing
themselves as the Papal Coach approaches The man whose name
is ARON BEN ZVI yawns and crosses himself too Then confident
that no one watches him he dismisses the Pope with a wave of
disdain As the Coach rattles toward the abbey Aron who well
call ARI steps to his stand and begins a pitch to those
lingering in awe of the Pope’s passing

ARI
Now while “holiness” lingers in
the air seize the chance good
people Here is the cure for
every earthly pestilence

He lifts a vial tied in a leather thong to be hung around the
neck A few people respond with mild interest

ARI
--Blessed water from the River
Jordan Water in which Saint John
baptized Christ our savior

A WOMAN
It cures ague

ARI
All agues all distempers all
illsYou doubt me You want
proof Therea man with an

abscess You

Ari points out a PEASANT in the crowd with an abscess the size
of a Ping-pong ball on his cheek

ARI
Come good Christian At no cost
in the spirit of our Lord let
me dispel that festering sore

The man seems confused but others around him get behind it
They shove him toward the stand

PEASANT
You can heal me

VOICES
Youll cure him
ARI
No Not me The water of Jordan
will cure him

THE ABBEY’S BAILIFF

and several GUARDS wander the market They notice the crowd
around Ari’s stand

ARI EXAMINES THE PEASANT’S FACE

while the crowd presses in around him He touches the abscess
and the man yelps with pain Taking a vial of Jordan water
he puts a drop in his palm and symbolically washes his hands
Then he places both hands on the man’s cheeks Covering the
large abscess he bows his head

As Ari mutters prayers the Bailiff pushes in for a closer look
The Peasant with the abscess mutters “The painit‘s going
away” Ari withdraws his hands and there is a collective gasp
from the crowd The abscess is gone Ari smiles

ARI
Now if you doubt your eyes deny
that you have seen a miracle
For a pittance for only a few
dinarii I will

Suddenly the Bailiff steps forward and grabs Ari’s hands and
pulls him forward He tears away his sleeve to the elbow and
withdraws the “abscess” (a make up appliance) holding it up
for the crowd

BAILIFF
A fraud

The peasant Ari’s accomplice bolts away through the crowd
Ari tries to tear his way out of his coat and escape as the
Bailiff and guards drag him to a large wagon where they tie him
to the wheel as the crowd punches at him

BAILIFF
Now show him what we think of
mountebanks

Ari is tied and the Bailiff steps back laughing as the mob
beats Ari in a blind rage

INT THE ABBEY PRISON - NIGHT

Asleep on the floor Hagen looks up at the sound of guards
entering the cell block Ari having been terribly beaten is
dragged into the cell and manacled to the wall opposite Hagen
Hagen looks on unconcerned as Ari collapses in a heap on the
floor Finally distracted by Ari’s moans Hagen slides a pot
of water across the cell floor to Ari
ig

Ari dips the torn sleeve of his shirt into the water and
squeezes drops onto his swollen blood caked lips It revives
him a bit and he studies Hagen

ARI
My thanks

HAGEN
Give it back

Ari takes a drink and slides the water back to Hagen

ARI

Ima fraud What are you
HAGEN

A thief
ARI

A chickena goata sack of

grain

HAGEN

I robbed this abbey
Ari brightens impressed

ARI
Ah the abbey Any relics

Hagen doesn’t quite comprehend

ARI
Like a hand of Saint Agnesa
thumb of John the Baptista
tooth from any saint
HAGEN
Gold
ARI
(shrugs not too
impressed)

Gold What can one say
Traditional if not very original

HAGEN
What

In todays world religious relics
are the true treasures People
flock to them like flies to dung
A saint’s finger bone is worth
many times its weight in gold
HAGEN
A finger bone is a finger bone
Who can prove it came from a
saint

Ari smiles painfully

ARI
Believe me it takes more than
just digging up corpses The
Church must accept the origins
of a holy relic

HAGEN
So you make up a story

ARI

(amused)
Make up a storyYes but it
has to be a story seasoned with
facts I’ve been to every major
shrine in Christendom Ive seen
the body of John the Baptist in
Samaria The crypt of Saint James
in Spain The fragment of the True
Cross in Jerusalem And when I
‘offer a saints bone the story
that goes with it is perfect

Hagen settles back against the wall

HAGEN
What story got you in here

ARI
The curse of arrogance I was
selling water

Hagen smiles amused
INT THE ABBOTS APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A POLISHED SILVER MAP circular in shape inlaid with
gold showing the lands of Europe North Africa and the
Mediterranean A finger bearing the papal ring touches the
large ruby indicating Jerusalem as Pope Urban speaks off screen

POPE URBAN Here is JerusalemThe center
of the world The bleeding heart
of our faith And surrounding
it

The hand sweeps the areas of Moslem conquest

POPE URBAN (0S)
The Moslem empire stretching from
the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic
coast of Spain

THE POPE

sits in the center of a table in a room hung with tapestries
and sumptuous brocade On his right is his Legate an elderly
bishop named ADHEMAR of LE PUY and the knight GODFREY OF
BOUILLON The Abbot is on his left He continues speaking as
the silver map is passed to Abbot

POPE URBAN
A vast empire of souls lost to
Christ A wealth of lands
conquered by virtue of a single
strength

THE ABBOT EXAMINES THE MAP

as musicians take their places in front of the table and food

is brought in There are no plates at the place settings Food
is taken from platter directly to the mouth with the fingers

or eaten from trenchers (flat breads placed in front of the
diners)

POPE URBAN (0S)
For Moslems warfare is an act
of religious faith A man who
falls in battle achieves paradise

GODFREY
Would Christian warriors be any
less valiant if they fought with
the same promise

ABBOT
No question that such a notion
would have vast appeal

ADHEMAR
(questioning)
StillThat God would sanction
the violence of war

ABBOT
We know God blesses the surgeon
who straps a man to a table and
saws off a gangrenous limbGod
sanctions the infliction of pain
when the cause is just

POPE URBAN
Exactly And God will sanction
a war for the purpose of
delivering those who languish
under Moslem rule to the kingdom
of Christ

ADHEMAR
Your reasoning is sound theology
I only wish that God might give
us some sign
21

POPE URBAN
For that we must pray

EXT A FIELD NEAR THE ABBEY - DAY

Ribbons and banners flap in the wind above countless tents
Knights nobles common folk monks and ascetics converge on
a raised dais hung with silks and garlanded with flowers where
a huge throne sits under a banner bearing the Papal seal

The PAPAL GUARD and abbey guards control the mob pressing
towards the platform Nobles sit on chairs in choice positions
guarded by lackeys A MONK’S CHOIR singing in Latin
approaches the dais

EXT THE ABBEY WALL - DAY

Hagen Ari and the madman their necks and wrists chained to
a beam are driven £oym the dungeon onto the roof by a quartet «
of GUARDS

GUARDS
HurryCome on get along

As the guards settle them on the roof the Popes procession
can be seen in the background A guard named VALT laughs as
he strikes Hagen’s leg with a club to lower him to his knees

VALT

going to see his Holiness

A JAILER MONK appears

You’re here at Pope Urbans
command Even the low and
villainous will receive his
blessing
There is no reaction from Hagen Ari nods

ARTI
Thats very kind of his Holiness

The Madman rolls his eyes towards heaven hissing and growling
at some apparition in the sky

EXT THE FIELD - DAY

Near the dais Emmich settles beside a PRETTY GIRL of noble
birth As he whispers in her ear she giggles Suddenly a roar
goes up from the crowd Emmich rises to see--

THE POPE ON A SEDAN CHAIR

is carried to the dais

FROM THE ROOF

Ari cranes to see the Pope while Hagen’s eyes search the

possibilities of escape The guards and monk kneel as the Pope
settles onto his throne

EXT THE FIELD - DAY

The Pope blesses the kneeling crowd then raising his hands

he brings them to their feet Assisted by the Abbot and
Adhemar he completes the blessing and faces the multitude which
goes silent

POPE URBAN
In Jerusalemin whose streets
walked Christ the son of God
In Jerusalem where the altar of
the Holy Sepulchre is graced by
a fragment of the very wood on
which our savior was crucified
»a fragment of the True
CrossMoslem hordes now disgrace
our shrines And in doing so
disgrace our God

An audible moan goes up from the crowd

EXT THE ROOF - DAY

Hagen leans back eyes half closed as the Pope speaks Ari sits
attentive and the Madman picks violently at his nose

POPE URBAN (V0)
Tragic stories are toldOf Nuns
chaste in their dedication to
Christ set upon in lust Their
clothes torn away by vile
heathens Their precious white
bodies fondled and ravaged by
blackamoors Oh hear their sad
lamentations

Ari reacts with a smile knowing the Popes words are hype
The Madman suddenly bays like a wolf The Jailer Monk smacks
him with a cudgel and he whimpers like a puppy

EXT THE DAIS - DAY
Pope Urban now goes to the heart of his message

POPE URBAN
The martyrs from their graves
the living who are enslaved call
for help Call for you to gird
yourselves for war and free them

POPE URBAN (Contd)
For it is better to die in battle
than tolerate the abuse of your
race and your holy places They
call you to take up arms as a God-
sent army and free Jerusalem

EXT THE ROOF - DAY
Hagen is now listening to the Pope’s words with interest

POPE URBAN (VO)
For those who fall there will be
remission from all sin and eternal
salvation But think not of death
for God will reward your valor
with victory and dominion over
the lands the wealth and the
kingdoms of the Moslem God willis
this war Do you hear God wills
it

The crowd responds with a chorus of “God wills it”

EXT THE CROWD - DAY

People are chanting “God wills itGod wills it” Emmich and
Waldemar smirk derisively

EXT THE ROOF - DAY

Ari breaks into the shout of “God wills it” The Jailer Monk
spins around A guard lifts a club to silence him

ARI
But his words are for every man
I‘m ready to fight to die to
free Jerusalem

He is smacked halfheartedly with the club

JAILER MONK
Youll die Youll hang soon
as his Holiness is down the road

In the distance the Pope can be seen raising his hands and the
chant of the crowd diminishes

POPE URBAN
Hear this God who speaks through
me will make his will known with
holy signs Miracles

HAGEN LISTENS SUDDENLY ATTENTIVE

POPE URBAN (V0)
Yes miracles will give proof that
the conquest of Jerusalem

24

POPE URBAN (Contd)
the recovery of the True Cross
are truly God’s will

(shouts)
GOD WILLS IT

The crowd responds with a roar As it continues a plan races
through Hagen’s mind

EXT THE CROWD - DAY

People are chanting “God wills it In the crowd Emmich touches
the ass of the pretty noble girl She turns He smiles and
mouths “God wills it” as he reaches forward and feels her
bosom

EXT THE DAIS - DAY
The Pope stands with his arms extended in a welcoming gesture

POPE URBAN
Now God calls you Come and
take the cross

The Pope is escorted from the dais to his sedan chair Monks
and other churchmen move in to deal with the mob that now surges
forward

GODFREY AND HIS RETINUE

push toward the dais as BROTHER BERNARD the Sacristan of
Adhemar speaks to the -crowd

BROTHER BERNARD
Those who cannot gopledge
support to those who can Pledge
your crops your sons to service
and receive remission from your
sins

Godfrey is among those offering themselves for the Crusade
Emmich watches for a beat then starts forward Waldemar grabs
his arm

WALDEMAR
Emmich you believe in this

EMMICH
Cousin aren’t you bored with
burning the villages of this
backwater for sacks of grain See
that knight

He points toward Godfrey

EMMICH
Strip away that gold breastplate
and there‘s a little man not haif
my worth or weight If he can
conquer kingdoms why can’t I

He pushes toward the dais Waldemar follows
BEFORE THE DAIS

Pushing shabbier KNIGHTS aside Emmich and Waldemar listen as
Godfrey speaks from the dais above them Adhemar is behind him

GODFREY
T am Count Godfrey of Bouillon
I have pledged all my earthly
possessions to support this great
venture Now pledge yourselves
to me and to victory

Emmich calls out for the crowd

EMMICH
Are you to lead us then Count
Godfrey

GODFREY

I will command in the field But
we are ruled by Gods will through
Pope Urban and his Legate Bishop
Adhemar of Le Puy

ADHEMAR SMILES

and raises his hand in a blessing

WALDEMAR SPEAKS TO EMMICH

WALDEMAR
A pious knight and a skirted
croneI see disaster

EMMICH
And opportunity

Knights around them kneel Emmich drops to his knees and
Waldemar follows as Adhemar leads in a Latin prayer

INT THE DUNGEON - DUSK

The guards and the Jailer Monk shove Ari and Hagen into their
cell the Madman shouts in an incomprehensible tongue from
across the hall

INT HAGEN AND ARIS CELL - DUSK

Hagens neck chain is locked to an iron ring on the wall while
Ari is chained to the opposite wall

When the guards leave Hagen yanks his chain to see if it comes
loose

ARI SETTLES
onto the floor muttering to himself

ARI
As long as the Pope stays they
wont hang us
(brightens)
Maybe he’‘ll trip on his hem and
break a leg

Hagen examines the metal ring to which his neck chain is
attached then notes a lamp in the hall outside the cell door
on Aris side

HAGEN
Ari the lamp in the
hallwayCan you reach it

Ari glances at the lamp then at Hagen

ARI
You have a plan An escape

HAGEN
Get me that lamp

Ari moves quickly to the bars He reaches his hand through and
stretches toward the lamp Hagen strips away his torn shirt
He is bare from the waist up

ANGLE

Ari‘s fingers touch the base of an oil lamp set in a rusty
sconce His face pushes against the bars and he grasps it

HAGEN SMILES

HAGEN
Give it to me

ARI
Whatever youre doing I want to
be part of it

HAGEN
Youll be part of it

Ari slides the lamp across the floor Hagen grabs it and holds
it under the ring to which his chain is attached Ari groans

ARI
That won’t work You can’t melt
iron with a lamp

Hagen says nothing and continues heating the ring

Ari sighs and the Madman across the dungeon hall begins baying
again Ari-turns to him

ARI
YouPlease can you turn me
into a werewolf I’11 do anything
to get out of here

THE MADMAN

looks at him smiling oddly through guttural growls he nods
“Yes”

THE RING GLOWS RED
Hagen sets down the lamp and turns From a kneeling position
he lines up the glowing ring with a spot between his shoulders
and presses his back against it A hiss and smoke curls up from
his burning flesh Steeling himself against the pain Hagen
rises slowly burning a strip of flesh along the length of his
spine
ARI TURNS FROM THE MADMAN AND WATCHES HIM AGHAST
ARI
mutters to himself)
Oi no he’s a meschug
HAGEN TURNS

A raw burn runs the length of his back He puts the lamp to
the ring heating it again

ARI WATCHES

mustering a benign look that he hopes won’t upset Hagen

THE MADMAN

hoots with apparent ecstasy as he peers from his cell

THE RING GLOWS

Hagen presses the ring to his right shoulder blade and draws

it horizontally across his back Sweat breaks on his forehead
and his breath quickens with pain When it is done he quickly
burns the palms of his hands on the still glowing ring then
tosses the lamp to Ari

HAGEN
Put it back

Ari dutifully takes the lamp and replaces it

HAGEN SETTLES

keeping his burned back from touching the walls ari faces him
still uncertain of his sanity When Hagen recovers his normal
breathing he speaks

HAGEN
Tell me everything you remember
about seeing the True Cross

EXT THE ABBEY COURTYARD MORNING

Through shafts of sunlight dust rises froma milling crowd
seeking to pledge for the crusade Peasants mainly who will
make up the rank and file of the army

1ST PEASANT
Along the Rhine there have been
holy signs a rain of frogs

2ND PEASANT
In Thiel it’s said a goose spoke
the Latin mass

FAT PEASANT
laughs
And my cow farted the liturgy

They laugh vValt the abbey guard who stands by the kitchen
door laughs too

FROM THE KITCHEN

the Jailer Monk followed by a NOVICE exit carrying bread and
water The Monk nods to Valt who accompanies them to the prison
entrance

INT THE PRISON - MORNING

Valt leads the Jailer Monk and the novice to the cell that holds
Hagen and Ari Both men are asleep on the floor

Hagen with his back to the wall looks up sleepily as the
novice enters and dumps loaves onto the floor Indicating
Hagen’s water jug in a corner of the cell the Jailer Monk
speaks

JAILER MONK
Give him your jug

Hagen reaches for his jug For an instant the light from the
window illuminates a large cross branded across his back

THE NOVICE GASPS

and drops the water bucket valt and the Jailer Monk are
dumbstruck
29

HAGEN
appears confused as the novice crosses himself

JAILER MONK
Turn around

HAGEN
What

JAILER MONK
I said turn around

Hagen turns Ari ahh’s theatrically and crosses himself ‘The
novice begins praying in Latin Valt whispers

VALT
Oh God a holy sign

The Jailer Monk glares at Hagen’s back not daring to believe
his eyes as Valt suddenly exits shouting “I’ve seen a holy
sign” The novice drops to his knees and kisses Hagen’s hand

EXT THE COURTYARD - MORNING

Chaos as Hagen shirtless and still in chains is led from the
dungeon surrounded by monks and guards who hold the masses
back The sight of his bare back causes hysteriashouts of
“The Holy SignBless usGod chose him” Peasant hands
stretch to touch him A knight drops to his knees and crosses
himself as Hagen is shoved past

INT THE CELL - MORNING
At the window Ari watches enjoying the excitement below

POV ARI

A mass of people are pushed back as Hagen is led up the steps
into the same hall where he was tried and condemned

INT THE GREAT HALL - DAY

Still in chains Hagen turns slowly in the middle of the floor
revealing his branded back The Pope the Abbot Adhenar his
sacristan Brother Bernard Godfrey and several monks look on
In spite of attempted restraint it’s obvious that a certain
amount of wonder pervades

ABBOT
you claim you felt no pain

Holding a salt cellar the Abbot takes a large piich and rubs
it hard into the burn Hagen displays no reactia

ABBOT
Nothing

HAGEN
Nothing- I tell you it came from
my dream

The Pope exchanges a look with the others

POPE URBAN
Very well Then tell us of your
dream

Hagen looks at the men

HAGEN
I was a knight pledged to serve
your cause in the battle for
Jerusalem

The Abbot stifles a snide laugh

ABBOT
Your Holiness He’s simply
telling you what he thinks you
want to hear

The Pope raises his hand for Hagen to go on

HAGEN
I was in the courtyard of a
strange church The dome was made
of wood and shaped like a fool’s
cap It was on fire

ADHEMAR
(a whisper)
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre

HAGEN
A monk called to me from the
entrance He said “I am
Theodis or Theosisthe name was
foreign I can’t remember it
But he said “God has sent you”

ABBOT
Blasphemy

ADHEMAR
Wait Was the monk’s name
Theodosius

HAGEN
Theodosius that’s the name

The gathering looks in amazement toward Adhemar as he speaks
to the Pope

The Pope studies Hagen for a moment while a current of muttering
fills the room The Abbot steps to the Pope

ABBOT
Your holiness this is a thief
who stole religious objects

POPE
to Hagen)
Serf are you repentant for your
crime
HAGEN

Iam I am ready to serve God
as a knight in holy battle

ABBOT
A knight This pikesman who
deserted his service

ADHEMAR
In his dream he was a knight and
the dream is a holy prophecy

POPE URBAN
with sudden authority)
I’1ll decide what is “holy
prophecy” It is only through me
that God speaks I will pray for
God‘s decision on this man’s fate

Hagen looks at the Pope mustering an expression of absolute
sincerity

HAGEN
I will pray too Holy Father

EXTINT FROM THE ABBOT’S APARTMENT A HIGH ANGLE - THE
COURTYARD - NIGHT

By torchlight the milling crowds of the courtyard murmur with
excitement The Pope’s voice is heard 0S

POPE (V0)
In a few weeks the story of this
“miracle” will spread through
Europe and ignite support for our
cause

The Pope turns from where he has peeked from behind a curtain
at the crowds below He turns and faces the Abbot with whom
he is alone

ABBOT
The man’s an absolute fraud

The Pope smiles shrugs
ADHEMAR
I know the monk Theodosius He
was keeper of the Holy Sepulchre

Hearing this Godfrey clasps his hands The apparent truth of
Hagens story is having an effect

HAGEN
He led me inside and through the
flames I saw a shining silver
cross

ADHEMAR
The receptacle of the True
CrossAnd what was on the wall
above the cross

HAGEN
A man holds his son to a rock with
a knife in his hand In the sky
above him there is a blinding
light

Adhemar smiles overcome by emotion

ADHEMAR
The mosaic of Abraham and Isaac
as I have seen it

ANGLE THE DOORWAYS

Monks eaves-dropping at the doorways pass the word Some cross
themselves and whisper prayers

ANGLE HAGEN

HAGEN
I pushed into the flames and
grabbed the silver cross see my
hands

He shows his burned palms

HAGEN
I lifted it onto my back but when
the hot metal touched my skin it
felt cold like ice I could see
nothing through the smoke and
flames but I was led by a voice
inside my head I carried the
cross to safety

For a beat the men are silent then Adhemar speaks to the Pope
ADHEMAR
(with emotion)
The sign we have prayed for
POPE
Perhaps but a useful fraud

The abbot doesn’t agree

ABBOT
He’s condemned He should hang

POPE
(laughs)
My dear Bishop you can’t hang
a living breathing miracle

The Abbot has no response

POPE URBAN
Godfrey would gladly take him
under his command But I prefer
this “Hagen of the miraculous
cross” serve a more secular noble

ABBOT
Someone who would not fall prey
to his deceit Someone who would
control him

POPE URBAN
Precisely

ABBOT
I know the man he should serve

INT THE ABBEY CHURCH - DAY

Emmich stands on the altar of the church holding a long sleeve
length gauntlet Slowly he drops small pebbles into it from
a golden urn held by two altar boys Behind him Waldemar
stands with Ivo captain of Emmich’s guard All are dressed
in their armor The Pope is seated to one side Adhemar
Godfrey Brother Bernard and several Acolytes are in the
background

Emmich shakes the gauntlet which is almost filled adds a few
more stones and grips it by the leather cuff

THE DOORS OF THE ABBEY CHURCH

are opened by acolytes and Hagen appears wearing a simple white
tunic with the Abbot walking beside him

Seeing Emmich Hagen reacts The Abbot smiles

ABBOT
Isn’t this what you asked for

Hagen steels himself and continues toward the altar

HAGEN’S EYES

lock on Emmichs as he approaches The Pope speaks from his
throne

POPE URBAN
I am granting your wish Hagen
You will serve our holy crusade
under the command of Count Emmich
of Bascarat Kneel before me

With a glance at Emmich Hagen kneels

POPE URBAN
I declare you pardoned and I bless
you in nomine patri filio et
spiritu sancti

EMMICH GENTLY SLAMS

the weighted gauntlet into the palm of his free hand A thin
smile plays on his lips as he crosses to Hagen

Emmich studies Hagen for a few seconds then draws the gauntlet
back and slams Hagen in the face as hard as he can

EMMICH
Are you loyalWill you serve
me

Hagen speaks forcing his works past the inclination to tear
Emmich limb from limb ”

HAGEN
I am loyal I will serve you

EMMICH
Then turn the other cheek

Hagen slowly turns his head and Emmich delivers the hardest
backhand blow he can muster The glove breaks pebbles fly in
all directions

EMMICH

Are you loyal Will you serve me
HAGEN

I am loyaland I will serve you

The last stones are shaken from the gauntlet and it is laid on
Hagen’s head

EMMICH
I dub you Hagen ‘knight of
Bascarat Rise
Hagen stands and a choir begins

Emmich embraces him As he

gives a gentle almost feminine kiss to Hagen’s bloody cheek
Hagen jerks his head back which amuses Emmich

Godfrey steps forward

GODFREY
TI will purchase this man’s armor
and horse

HAGEN
I thank you Count Godfrey But
in my dream I rode my own horse
which was taken by the bailiff
of this abbey

The Abbot glares at him

ADHEMAR
See that his horse is returned

Hagen graciously nods to Adhemar

HAGEN

And in my dream my squire was a
man called Ari who shared my
cell

ABBOT
A fraud A mountebank

ADHEMAR
to the Abbot)

Another sinner that God has called

to repentance See that he’s
released

Hagen bows his head in gratitude

INT ARI‘S CELL - NIGHT

Ari reacts to the sound of a door opening and the approach of
footsteps He rises to see--

HAGEN APPEARS

at the door to the cell with valt and another guard They open

the door and cross to Ari

chains

leave he speaks to Hagen

ARI
(a whisper)
It worked

Hagen nods

Without a word they unlock his
Arl reacts not daring to believe

As the guards

HAGEN
You’re my squire

Ari leaps at Hagen and hugs him trying to kiss him on the mouth
Hagen turns his face and Ari kisses his neck as Hagen
disengages

HAGEN
Hey Squires don’t kiss their
knights

ARI

You Northern Europeans are so
cold This is a moment of great
eruptive passion

As they leave the cell Ari continues

ARI
I will be a squire as there has
never been a squire I will be
a squire as such that the
troubadours will sing

As they exit the prison hallway the Madman pushes his head
through the bars and gives a long mournful howl Hagen glances
at him then shouts to the guards

HAGEN
Release him too

GUARD
By whos order

HAGEN
God wills it

The guards exchange a look and a shrug and release the Madman

EXT THE COURTYARD - NIGHT

Hagen crosses the courtyard carrying a large basket and trailed
by the Madman who follows him like a grateful dog The Bailiff
gives Hagen a dirty look but the reaction of others both monks
and peasants makes it clear that Hagen is a living legend

Valt the crossbowman other men from the Abbey guard and
several peasants fall in behind him

VALT
Hagen of the crossTake me with
you to serve you

Others quickly surround Hagen with similar pleas “Take us to
serve you”
HAGEN
Dont be fools Stay with your
wives and families

Valt steps up to Hagen and appeals as spokesman for the others

VALT
For us there is no hope in this
land Take us

Hagen looks them over

HAGEN
I have nothing If you follow
me you must bring your own food
your clothes your weapons

He turns and continues walking They follow Whether he wants
it or not Hagen has gathered an entourage

HAGENS HORSE

tied near the stable whinnies at his approach Hagen pulis
carrots from the basket and gives them to the horse Seeing
the Bailiff he laughs aloud

The Bailiff turns away and Hagen’s following jeers him as he
moves away

EXT THE DEPARTURE - DAY

The valley dominated by the abbey is filled with humanity
While people mill around embracing loved ones accepting last
minute offers of food and gifts a weird chanting is heard off-
screen

A PROCESSION

led by the Madman now hung with chains and crosses marches
through the gathering at the head of a sizeable following a
host of peasants armed with clubs scythes picks and pitch
forks some followed by ragged wives and children

AS THE MADMAN PASSES

he mutters aloud amidst hoots and animal noises a nonsensical
stream of consciousness

MADMAN
Gods voice Angels speak
Shebelshabeh wa shenibahem

(he bays like a wolf)
Faith will conquer the heathen
Hallelujah Ya menishnah o rahemi

The Madman bolts ahead in wild dancing steps Growling
roaring at the ranks of crusaders Flagellants fall to their
knees flailing themselves with enhanced frenzy at his passing

HAGEN
gazes with bemused disgust
EXT NEAR THE HEAD OF THE CRUSADE - DAY

The lead knights stand beside their horses and each holds a Elag
with the emblem of his family domain Godfrey walks in front

of them holding a large white banner with a crimson crossThe
symbol of the crusade As he comes to each knight the man
states his name and title

BALDWIN OF CHARTRES is a refined nobleman like Godfrey

A KNIGHT
Baldwin of Chartres Duke of
Fontainebleu and nephew of the
kingI accept your command

Baldwin lowers his own flag Godfrey takes it and crumples it
in his hand against the flag of the crusade before moving on
to the next

Godfrey steps to Emmich who looks a bit shabbier than the
others

EMMICH
Emmich of Bascarat
(Emmich is stuck He
has nothing more to
add)
I accept your command

Emmich lowers his flag and Godfrey meshes it with the crusade
flag

EXT THE HEAD OF THE CRUSADE (LATER) -

Godfrey with a color guard of vassals rides before the ranks
as the knights assemble

GODFREY
By my order pillage or violence
against any through whose lands
we pass will be met by death The
army of God will not lay waste
the land

As he moves on--
EMMICH IN SCRUFFY ARMOR
moves among his knights who are waiting to take the road They

are a shabby looking-lot who appear seasoned for battle through
brigandage
39

EMMICH
I would have each of you know
if any turns from my commandI
will pluck his navel

Emmich is now in front of Hagen am) staring directly at him Jz

EMMICH
loop his gut to the pommel of
my saddle and drag him to the Holy
Land by his innards Know this
is my punishment for betrayal

HAGEN’S FACE

betrays nothing as he stares back at Emmich Again the sound
of trumpets and drums

GODFREY

his armor shining and his silks resplendent makes his horse
rear at the head of his men as if posing for a heroic statue

GODFREY
To Jerusalem and victory

Trumpets blare With thunderous cheers the beat of drums and
the chorus of countless monks the Crusade moves forward

EXT THE PANORAMA OF THE CRUSADE - DAY

The scene is in a word --- splendid Colors and images from
a historical dreamtime combine like an old master’s canvas as
hundreds of mounted knights lead a flowing river of humanity
toward the distant horizon

IN A SERIES OF SHOTS

Cartloads of food and supplies and hordes of ragged foot
soldiers trudge behind the knights Families walk with the men
mothers bidding goodbye to their sons and wives to their
husbands

Legions of monks walk beside a canopied cart that carries
Adhemar and his entourage of clergy He offers blessing in all
directions ‘

Among the troops oxcarts pass from which HARLOTS in gaudy
clothing display themselves Their faces are grotesquely
rouged some wear bizarre shaped masks that cover their eyes
They wave to the surrounding foot soldiers who whistle and
return lewd gestures

HAGEN AND ARI

ride among the hundreds of knights
The CAMERA lowers to a foreground of moving feet and rising dust
which gradually obliterates the scene

DISSOLVE THROUGH
EXT A JUNCTION - DAY

Where the road passes a junction an army of similar make-up
feeds into the column people From another region joining the
swelling ranks of crusaders

ARI SPEAKS QUIETLY TO HAGEN
as they watch the new arrivals

ARI
Look at them This madness has
spread like plague By the time
we reach Bari to sail east it
is said well be fifty thousand
strong

HAGEN
Less one I leave tonight for
the land of the Slavs

ARI
Why

HAGEN
To live from what I steal

ARI

What’s to steal from the Slavs
Moldy bread Putrid sausage from
stinking villagers

HAGEN
I dont rob villagers

ARI
What then The nobles live in mud
huts Youll hang for stealing
cow plops

HAGEN
I won’t serve Emmich

They ride for a beat and Ari speaks again with a sense of
caution

ARI
Then is the rumor true That
you arerelated

Hagen turns and faces Ari His face is flushed with hate

ARI
Only a fool allows the troubles
of his past to ruin the joy of
his future Stay with this
crusade Rob yourself rich and
be blessed rather than hanged for
it

Hagen says nothing Ari removes a purse from his waist

ARI
Weve already made some denarii
Half is yours

He tosses it to Hagen

HAGEN
Where did you get this

ARI
(smiles)
I sold the garments of “Hagen
of the miraculous cross”

HAGEN
My old clothes

ARI
(laughs)
and some odds and ends I
snatched from a clothes line

Both men laugh

ARI
Trust me blindly We’re on the
road to riches

EXT THE CRUSADE - DUSK

Alongside a length of road that stretches through rolling farm
jiand the army has begun setting up a camp for the night

Fires burn and pots boil with millet gruel

Monks kneel in the stubble of a field and sing vespers before
a makeshift altar where Adhemar gives a blessing Godfrey and
several of his knights can be seen in the front rows

Foot soldiers and some knight cluster around the harlot’s cart
The bare legs and thighs of the women protrude from curtained
sides which hide their upper bodies Men having dropped only
their britches work at them A MADAM and a pair of burly
cudgel-wielding PIMPS maintain order as the men crowd around
Each pays a few coins and as a customer working a pair of
thighs roars with completion he is pulled away and quickly
replaced by another

Waldemar and Ivo approach Shoving the pimps away and
threatening them with their weapons they yank several men from
the thighs and indulge themselves

Emmich laughs as he watches them from a short distance away
declining their invitation to join in

HAGEN

glances at the spectacle with disdain then turns away as Ari

appears with a bowl of millet The men sit by their tent and
eat from the same bowl with their fingers The carnal grunts
of the harlot’s cart blend with the singing of the monks

EXT ROAD BESIDE THE CRUSADER CAMP - NIGHT

A horsedrawn wagon moves at a quick pace along the road beside
the encamped crusaders It holds about a dozen people who sing
a gay song accompanied by rap drums and tambourines

By their style of dress and general appearance the people in
the wagons can be identified as Jews They are a WEDDING PARTY
A young BRIDE and GROOM in wedding finery sit on a raised seat

EXT EMMICHS ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Emmich rises from where he eats with his men near the road and
stares at the approaching wagons A fat HERMIT MONK standing
beside him spits and mutters “Jews”

EMMICH
The killers of Christ I‘d like
to get a look at them

AS THE WAGON APPROACHES

Emmich with Ivo Waldemar and a few of his men step onto the
road and block the way Waving their hands they shy the horses
to a stop

EMMICH

approaches the wagon and gawks at the Jews as though they were
an exhibit in a bestiary The Hermit Monk is beside him

EMMICH
So these are JewsThey look
almost human

HERMIT MONK

We take arms against the enemies
of Christ and here are his worst
foes

Ivo snatches the yarmulke off a YOUNG JEW and puts it on-his
head Other knights laugh An OLD MAN speaks to Emmich from
the tense silence on the cart

OLD MAN
Hear me good knight We serve
as silversmiths to the most
excellent Bishop of Mainz We
live in this region lawfully
under a charter of his protection

EMMICH
The Bishop of Mainz is a long way
off little man

There are titters from Emmich’s men as more gather around the
cart

HAGEN

looks up from where he is eating with Ari near their tent (which
is somewhat apart from the others) He sees Emmich and his men
around the wagon

Ari too sees it He mutters almost to himself
ARI

Foolsthey should have stayed
in their village

Still gnawing a lamb bone Hagen rises to watch
EMMICH
now glances at the bride
OLD MAN
We are now come from a wedding
It is a day of joy for these young
people

Emmich reaches to touch her ankle and she draws it away An
evil snickering from the surrounding knights

EMMICH
I like a bit of joy myself

Emmichs men laugh The Jews whisper among themselves in Hebrew
and the BRIDE’S FATHER offers a purse

BRIDE’S FATHER
Here good knight Take this in
tribute to your cause and let us
pass

Emmich takes the purse and makes a face

EMMICH
Only this

Other purses are offered and grabbed by Emmich’s men igniting
their greed

A JEWISH WOMAN shrieks as her earrings are plucked by the Hermit
Monk

Like a pack of wolves the Knights begin snatching things from
the wagon A shawl is pulled from OLD LADY A Menorah from

a RABBI A lute from MUSICIAN A basket of food is found and
loaves of bread are thrown among the knights The Jews pull
away from the grasping hands and huddle in the center of the
wagon

The Old Man speaks to Emmich

OLD MAN
You have your tribute knight
Now let us go

EMMICH
But I’ve not had my prize

His hand shoots out and grabs the brides gown She clings to
the Groom as Emmich pulls at her Her foot kicks him in the
face A he flinches she snatches her hem from his grasp

As Emmich‘s hand goes for his dagger Hagen is suddenly in front
of him After a beat he points at the bride and orders Hagen

EMMICH
Pull her down

Hagen doesn’t move

EMMICH
That‘s an order knight of my
command Pull her down and spread

spawned

HAGEN
Let them go

Emmich looks at Hagen seeming to enjoy his disobedience Ari
moves behind Emmich’s men Seeing a woodsman’s axe he pulls
it from a log With a whistle he throws it over the heads of
Emmichs men toward Hagen

HAGEN TURNS

at Aris whistle and catches the axe Facing Emmich he moves
to the front of the cart and glances up at the bride

HAGEN
CongratulationsEnjoy each
other —

Hagen swats the rump of the cart horse and the animal bolts
Emmich stares in disbelief as the wagonload of Jews rattles
away

HAGEN
Now arm yourselfor do I have
to wear a maiden’s skirts to bring
out your courage

EMMICH
Your life is over bastard Squire
My armor

Satisfied Hagen walks several feet from Emmich and leans
casually on his axe handle as Emmich is suited up

ARI’S LOOK

goes from Hagen to Emmich His face registers concern

EMMICH

takes a large formidable pole-axe with a sharp forked tip from
one of his men A shield is fitted to his arm and a “pot helm’
placed on his head

EMMICH’S MEN

fall back as Hagen steps forward with a few practice swings of
his axe

EMMICH

raises his pole-axe to a threat position and faces Hagen
THE COMBAT

IN A SERIES OF SHOTS

For several seconds the men stalk each other Then Hagen shifts
from right to left hand stance and charges Emmich Emmich’s
shield blocks Hagen’s blow with a shower of sparks The men
resume defense positions circling each other

Emmich feints a move at Hagen’s groin with the forked tip of

the axe Hagen blocks with a blow of his woodsman’s axe against
the metal handle of the pole axe Sparks fly and a chunk of
Hagen’s blade is lost

Emmich’s eyes can be seen through the slits of his helmet

Hagen moves before a jeering backdrop of Emmich’s men and
attacks again driving his axe head into Emmich’s shield As
Hagen struggles to free it he ducks a blow from Emmich’s axe
With a huge jerk Hagen pulls the shield from Emmich’s arm
The momentum sends it flying over the heads of the men like a
giant frisbee

Waldemar eases a pike hook into the circle and catches Hagen’s
ankle He pulls and twists and Hagen goes down

Emmich rushes him and swings the axe burying it in the earth
beside Hagen‘s face as he rolls away As Hagen scrambles to
his feet Emmich charges him with the forked end Hagen backs
against a wagon and Emmich drives the pointed tips through the
mail of Hagen’s shirt and into the wooden side

Emmich draws a dagger and slashes at Hagen while he tries to
tear himself free Finally Hagen rips the chain mail from his
upper body and tears free He swings at Emmich and Emmich
blocks Hagen’s wild swings continue until with an overhead
vertical blow he tries to cut Emmich in halé£

Emmich’s axe-blade catches the wooden handle of Hagen’s axe and
cuts it through Hagen’s axe-head buries itself in the ground

Hagen now holds only the wooden handle of the axe Eerie
laughter echoes from inside Emmich’s helmet as he stalks Hagen
for the kill

Hagen takes a stance holding the axe handle in both hands like
a Louisville Slugger He bobs and weaves on the balls of his
feet as Emmich charges and swings Hagen ducks under the blow
Like seasoned batter he slams the axe handle into the chin of
Emmichs helmet The blow resounds with a metallic crunch
Emmich is lifted off his feet and hurled onto his back

For seconds Emmich is motionless his helmet grotesquely
deformed by the force of Hagens blow As Hagen steps forward
the axe handle poised to finish him Emmich moves He struggles
to his knees blood cascades from beneath his chin and wells
from the twisted eye slits of the helmet as he raises his head
Gripping the sides of the helmet Emmich makes a sudden desperate
attempt to wrestle it off A blood-choked scream gurgles from
within

Hagen remains ready to kill until a second agonized scream and
sobs are heard from the helmet Hagen lowers the axe handle
and lets it drop to the ground He turns and Emmich’s men back
away opening a path for him as he walks toward the fires of
the camp

Ari falls in step with Hagen He glances around nervously to
see if Emmich’s men are following as they head for their tent

EXT OUTSIDE EMMICH’S TENT - NIGHT

A SMITH kneels beside Emmich and with a large cutting tool snips
the rivets on Emmich’s helmet It is carefully pulled away by

a SURGEON and his ASSISTANT Several teeth fall amidst clotted
blood from inside Waldemar gasps as he sees

EMMTICH’S

lower jaw and cheek are smashed to pulp Emmich senses the
extent of his disfigurement in wWaldemar’s look

WALDEMAR
He will die for this cousin
Tonight in his tent

Waldemar makes the motions of plunging a knife Emmich speaks
his voice distorted by pain disfigurement and rage
EMMICH
NoNo death is not enough

EXT THE DOCKS OF BARI - NIGHT
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS

A forest of masts are reflected in torchlight along the city’s
docks as supplies are loaded onto boats

Foot soldiers are marched onto the decks of barges

Cranes swing horses through the air to the decks of livestock
ships

EXT A LIVESTOCK BOAT - NIGHT

Hagen stands near a boat where horses are loaded He walks his
horse to a crane and calms her as she is fitted into harness

UNDER THE EAVES OF A BUILDING

a short distance away Emmich stands in the shadows with a
Genoese merchant named VERMI Emmich’s face is barely visible
as they speak and watch Hagen

VERMI
The big one

EMMICH
Is that a problem

VERMI
Not at all

In the background Hagen watches as the mare is lifted by the
crane and swung onto the ship

VERMI
Five hundred dinarii’ will see he’s
put on the right ship

EMMICH
Done

VERMI
(smiles)
No quibbling over priceWhat
did this man do

Vermi looks at Emmich who has stepped into the light His face
is hideously scarred Rough stitches and cuts the evidence
of Medieval trauma surgery still cover his jaw

VERMI
He is the one who

Vermi gestures vaguely towards his own face
EMMICH
(a slight threat)
Does it matter

VERMI
No To me it’s just trade

EXT THE OPEN SEA - MORNING
A small single masted ship about sixty feet in length runs
before an easy breeze over following seas Islands can be seen
in the background
EXT ABOARD THE BOAT - MORNING
On the mid-deck about thirty monks mostly young novices are
sprawled in various positions of repose A few are sick
vomiting over the rail

Valt the guard from the Abbey sleeps on a pile of rope with
his crossbow nearby

HAGEN GAZES

from the forecastle A pair of sullen crewmen tighten a line
nearby Crossing to Ari who is asleep on the deck Hagen rouses
him

HAGEN
Wake up

Ari awakens with a start

HAGEN
(cutting him off)

Quiet Last night we were

surrounded by other shipsToday

there’s none
Ari digests this He gets to his feet and looks around In
the background the monks begin singing a shaky madrigal as he
searches the horizon which is studded with islands

HAGEN
Are we lost

ARI
Hopefully

HAGEN

ARI
very concerned)
There are worse things

HAGEN
Like what

Ari sees something off on the horizon

ARI
Like that

POV - ARI AND HAGEN

A lateen rigged ship slips from behind an island
ARI

stares at the ship with real alarm

ARI
MoslemsCorsairs

Suddenly the monk’s madrigal is broken off as--
THE SAIL OF THE SHIP
is lowered onto the deck by the crew
ARI IMMEDIATELY FIGURES IT OUT
ARI
The crew’s dropping sail The
bastards have sold us

HAGEN
What

ARI
Weve been sold to Moslem slavers

Ari charges to a pile of belongings He pulls out swords and
tosses one to Hagen

ARI
Our only chance is to take the
ship Weve got to try and out
run them

HAGEN RACES UP TO THE AFTER DECK

Seeing him a mate grabs a pump handle and slams him in the
face knocking him onto the lower deck With another sailor
the man jumps him

Hagen hurls one man over the side The other comes again with
the pump handle Hagen grabs him and slams his skull on the
rail spilling his brains

ARI SWINGING WILDLY WITH HIS SWORD

drives the crew back from the fallen sail which lies on the
deck The monks react with total confusion Several try to
pray and Ari kicks them

ARI
Off your knees Grab the lines
Raise the sail
(to Valt)
Keep them back
VALT

cranks a bolt into his crossbow and aims at the crew

THE MONKS

haphazardly follow Aris commands while valt keeps the crew
at bay with his crossbow

ARI
The lines Pull Haul

Monks stumble in every direction
THE CORSAIR’S SHIP

is approaching fast The SLAVERS stripped to the waist some
in turbans stand on the forecastle ready to jump Others are
in the rigging ready to swing aboard

ARI STRAINS AT

the halyard with the monks Hand over hand the sail inches
up and begins to take wind

THE CORSAIRS

are now within a hundred feet as the sail fills The little
Merchantman heels over and starts to pick up speed

ARI SCREAMS AT HAGEN

ARI
Steer the ship Steer the ship

HAGEN GRABS THE STEERING OAR

Having no idea what he’s doing he pulls it towards him The
ship swings around the sail flapping wildly The captain roars
with laughter Hagen grabs him by the neck

HAGEN
Why are you laughing

He pitches him over the stern rail Then he shoves the steering
oar in the opposite direction The sail backwinds gibes and
tears away from the mast falling in on the men below

Valt is knocked down He recovers his crossbow and aims at the
Corsair ship as --

WILD SCREAMS AND ROARS OF LAUGHTER

sound from the slavers as they close on the merchantman

A TATTOOED BERBER

on the bow shouts in some incomprehensible tongue and makes
obscene gestures as a bolt from valt’s crossbow thunks into his
forehead

HAGEN RUSHES TO

fight as the Corsair ship collides with the merchantman and they
swarm aboard

EXT THE SHIPS - DAY

IN A SERIES OF SHOTS

A Corsair swinging to the after-deck is beheaded by Hagen in
mid-air Others follow swinging and jumping from the
Lateener’s rigging

Ari drags himself from the tangle of sail sword in hand to see-

Corsairs like a frenzied pack of hyenas hooting and screaming
herd the defenseless monks with their scimitars

Valt tries to load a bolt as he is clubbed to the deck

Ari cornered by a hooting mob simply lowers his sword and they
grab him
—

Hagen is surrounded The slavers taunt and jab at him as he
swipes at them with his sword

A huge Berber stalks Hagen with a net while the others distract
him As Hagen lunges at them the net is thrown Entangled
Hagen is pulled down toa the deck

EXT THE CORSAIR SHIP - NIGHT

The BEY of the Corsairs a huge Turk with facial tattoos
examines his captives The monks are fettered by their ankles
to a long massive chain

HAGEN IS CHAINED

apart His captors eat nearby obviously proud of their catch
At the Bey’s approach Hagen is prodded with a scimitar He
twists in his chains and the Bey smiles at his men

The Bey then crosses to Ari and Valt who are chained together
As he looks them over--

ARI SUDDENLY COMES TO LIFE

ARI
Effendi Fil isma Al AllahIt
is wrong I am enslaved with these
eaters of pig I ama believer

The Bey studies him

BEY
For such a lie you will eat your
tongue and lips

The Bey’s bodyguard grabs Ari by the hair and pulls his upper
lip as the Bey removes his dagger

ARI
(frantic)
No Effendi bey I was taken
slave by the Christians I am
a Moslem La Illahu illa Alla
I ama hadji I have been to
Mecca

The Bey pauses with his knife at Ari’s lip

BEY
And I have been to MeccaA
place forbidden to infidels such

as you

ARI
Effendi I walked seven times
around the Ka’aba and kissed the
sacred stoneI drew water from
the well of Zam Zamgathered

ARI (Contd)
seven stones at MuzdalifaI
am a true believer

The Bey reacts to Aris claim He pauses with the knife

BEY
Name the first surah of the Koran

ARI
Al Baqara

BEY
Recite it

Ari is stuck

ARI
Effendi Bey I am a common man
not a mullah

The Bey’s knife again comes to his lips

Ari suddenly wrestles with the string that holds his pants and
they drop

ARI
Look Look at my organ It is not
cut according to our faith Look
at this magnificent turbaned head
Compare it with the filthy shroud-
skins of thesé infidels and know
that I am born to the faith

The Bey stare for a beat at Ari’s cock then smiles and speaks
to the Guards

BEY
Unchain him

Ari clasps his hands Speaking Arabic gratitudes he kisses
the Bey’s proffered hand

HAGEN WATCHES

as Ari is unchained and offered food by the Corsairs He steps
past Hagen without a glance

EXT THE PORT OF JAFFA - DAY

amidst a melee of shouting and haranguing Hagen Valt and the
monks are driven by whip-bearing SLAVE HANDLERS from the
Corsairship onto the docks of Jaffa

with liberal use of whips and clubs the new arrivals are forced
through a huge barred gate into a waterfront building

EXT THE SLAVE PENS - DAY

The men are herded into the center of a courtyard by guards
shouting at them in Arabic

HAGEN LOOKS AROUND

The courtyard is surrounded by cells in which people can be
seen Groups of turbaned men converse as they examine pods of
slaves men of all races who have been brought from the cells
into the courtyard for inspection

In one section of the courtyard women sit chained under the
shade of thatched eaves Most are black a few of them hold
small children A stately tribal woman ornamented with scars
stands nude while prospective buyers examine her

A WHIP CRACKS ON HAGENS

back He spins and leaps at the man but four huge GUARDS beat
him back with clubs Subdued by overwhelming force he is
driven with others toward a row of cells

INT THE CELLS - NIGHT

Hagen shares a crowded cell with valt and the monks The
evening prayer from a distant mosque blends with the moans and
weeping of the slave pens

After several seconds of sitting still Hagen suddenly yanks
at his chains trying to pull the ring from the wall or break
the manacles on his wrists Valt is watching him
VALT
You are blessed Hagen Make God
deliver us
Hagen says nothing A MONK chimes in

MONK
Yes you bear the sign

A general murmur of appeals begins Directed at Hagen from all
the monks

HAGEN
QuietStop your mewling

The monks are silent for a beat then one starts to pray in
Latin Hagen shoves the man down with his foot

HAGEN
And stop your damned praying

The monks are silent

EXT THE SLAVE COURTYARD - DAY

A group of SERVANTS place a heavy table in the center of the
courtyard under the supervision of a SURGEON and his ASSISTANT
who are dressed in white but wear red leather aprons

INT THE CELL - DAY
Hagen watches them through the bars
POV HAGEN

The surgeon’s assistant fans the coals in a small brassiere and
places a brass pot over them to boil The surgeon opens a bag
and begins removing knives Testing the edges he hones them
on a stone The attendant shoos at several curious chickens
that peck around the legs of the table

A short distance away four women knead fresh cow dung while two
other unwind and fold rolls of raw cotton Beside them
servants dig a ditch like a very shallow grave in the sand
of the courtyard

INTEXT THE CELL - DAY

Valt cranes to see as the surgeon and a SLAVE DEALER who is
a well dressed Arab of obvious authority consult in the
courtyard

VALT
What are they doing

HAGEN
I don’t know

The slave dealer sends four guards toward the cell
VALT
(nervous to the’monks)

Does any one know what theyre

doing
The guards enter the cell Without a word they start unlocking
Valt whose confusion quickly mounts to terror He struggles
as he is pulled from the cell

VALT
NoNo

HAGEN WATCHES AS
Valt is dragged across the courtyard toward the table

VALT IS PULLED DOWN

onto the table His hands are slipped into the pillory above
his head His legs are forced over the edge and strapped to
the legs

THE MONKS

view this with nervous curiosity

THE SURGEON

steps between Valt’s bare legs and studies his groin for a beat
Then he reaches down gently lifts Valts genitals and cuts
them away with a curved knife that resembles a linoleum cutter
Valt looses a deep agonized scream

INT THE CELL - DAY

Valt’s continuing cries of agony cut through the cell As the
monks fight their chains Hagen stares transfixed in horror as-

BLOOD POURS DOWN

Valts thighs and calves onto the dust of the compound The
surgeons hands plop an indistinguishable mass of bloody flesh
into a large clay bowl With his slippered foot he kicks away
a curious dog

THE SURGEONS ASSISTANT

hands him a glowing cautery which he applies to the veins Then
in a quick professional move the assistant swabs valt’s groin
with hot oily pitch

A FOUNTAIN OF VOMIT SPEWS FROM VALT’S MOUTH
choking and gagging him as he screams

HAGEN STARES

through the bars Behind him the monks are hysterical bawling
imploring the Lord for mercy now that their fate has become
obvious

VALT IS LIFTED

from the table He twitches convulsing as he is dragged across
the courtyard and laid on a mat by the women Two of them begin
packing his groin with fresh cow dung while the others prepare
to wrap him with cotton

HAGEN WINDS

his wrist-chain several times around his hand He bellows as
with all his strength he tries to break it Blood runs from
his palm The cell door opens and four GUARDS enter carrying
a long staff with a noose of chain Slipping it over Hagen’s
neck they twist until they choke him into submission when he
is nearly faint they pull him from the cell

POV HAGEN

Hagen’s eyes sweep the compound gathering impressionistic
imagesChickens peck at the blood beneath the table The cur
sniffs the clay pot containing Valt’s manhood vValt writhes
and twists in agony as wrapped in cotton he is lowered into
the ditch and buried up to his chest

EXT THE COURTYARD - DAY

Held by six struggling guards Hagen twists and fights as he
is pulled to the table Finally again choked to submission by
the chain he is forced down

THE WOODEN PILLORY

locks over his wrist

HIS LEGS ARE SPREAD

and his ankles strapped to the heavy legs of the table

THE SURGEON LOOKS ON

with totally professional calm sharpening his knife as
HAGEN’S PANTS

are pulled away He writhes and the heavy table groans with
stress as more restraints are put on him

The surgeon wipes the knife clean with a white cloth
THE ASSISTANT LIFTS

the boiling pitch from the fire and places the swab in it He
lifts the cautery which glows red All is ready

HAGEN ROARS AS THE SURGEON

steps between his legs and looks down at his genitals

HAGEN TWISTS HIS HEAD

against the vomit slick table top He looks down as-

THE SURGEON

gently lifts the genitalia and lowers the knife Suddenly there
is a shout from OFF SCREEN in Arabic The surgeon pauses and
looks around

HAGEN STRAINS

to turn his head to the side He sees

A GROUP OF MEN

in Arab clothes approach On’of them is Ari who is talking a ¢—
mile a minute

ARI
Don’t you understand I serve the
Emir Ibn Khaldun He has heard
of this man of his size his
strength

The slave dealer argues with Ari

SLAVE DEALER
But the Emir must understand

They have stepped close to the table Ari takes a quick look
at Hagen’s crotch with obvious relief

SLAVE DEALER
this man’s fate was sealed in
GenoaOur merchant there was
handsomely paid by a French noble
to have him rendered a eunuch
before being sold

ART
You tell me that some deceit made
between Infidels in Genoa is to
be honored over the wishes of a
Moslem Prince

SLAVE DEALER
No but

HAGEN TWISTS HIS HEAD
to follow Ari as he walks around the table inspecting him

ARI
The Emir seeks a stallion not a
gelding I am sent from
Jerusalem to purchase this man
intact

The slave dealer glances down at Hagen He walks slowly around
the table followed by Ari The surgeon and his assistant stand
waiting

SLAVE DEALER
(shrugs agreement)

As you say why honor an agreement
made between infidels

Ari gives Hagen a secret wink then turns to the slave dealer
and removes a purse from this belt
—

ARI
A purse of Turkish Gold

The slave dealer extends his hand His finger tip lightly

touches the bottom of the purse weighing it

SLAVE DEALER
Double this and he’s yours

ARI
An outrage Roll him away from
his balls

Ari turns on his heel and starts away Hagen reacts with a
shout “No The slave dealer pursues Ari

HAGEN CRANES
to see them where they argue a short distance away

ARI AND THE SLAVE DEALER

AR
Tell me a price that’s not an
insult

SLAVE DEALER
I must be compensated I will
have discord from the Genoese
Ari extends the purse

ARI
This for the slave

Two gold coins appear like magic in the fingers of Ari’s hand

ARI
And these for your discord

The slave dealer shrugs a grudging acceptance
HAGEN

seeing the slave dealer and Ari exchanging “Salaams” heaves a
huge sigh of relief

EXT THE SLAVE PENS DAY

Surrounded by guards Hagen follows Ari to a cart in front of
the slave pens He looks up to see AMBU a huge African with
tribal scars looking down at him suspiciously

Ambu signals him into the cart Hagen climbs up and Ambu
indicates a pile of straw where Hagen settles Ari climbs up
beside an Arab driver and signals him to go

THE CART ROLLS

away from the slave pens The HORRIBLE CRY of another eunuch
rends the air

HAGEN
looks back as the wagon carries him off
EXT A WELL OUTSIDE THE TOWN - DAY

The driver waters the cart horses Ari turns and speaks to
Ambu

ARI
Ambu get water for the Frank

Ambu doesn’t seem to like the idea but he does as ordered

HAGEN
(indicating Ambu)
Who is he

ARI
Ambu the chief slave of Emir Ibn
Khaldun’s guard He will be your
trainer

HAGEN
My trainer

ARI
Youll be trained for the personal
body guard

HAGEN
I’m not going to be a slave

ARI
Try to appreciate what Ive done
My uncle is counselor to Ibn
Khaldun With great effort I
persuaded him to buy you

Hagen glares at Ari

HAGEN
All I need is a horse and sword

ARI
What chance would you have You’re
a Frank in the Moslem world
They’d have you back in the slave
pens before the morning cock
crows This time theyd

Ari hooks his finger and makes a gesture of Ccastrating Hagen
Ari speaks quickly as Ambu returns from the well

ARI
The Crusaders have besieged
Antioch When it falls they’11l
march on Jerusalem Then there
will be a chance for escape For
now put your faith in Allah the
merciful and compassionate and
try to behave

HAGEN
Allah Are you really a Moslem -

Ari speaks quickly as Ambu reaches the wagon
ARI

I blend with my surroundings

You should do the same
Ambu puts a bucket of water in front of Hagen He makes a
gesture of drinking Hagen glares at him for a beat then cups
his hand and drinks
EXT THE ROAD - DUSK

The wagon rumbles along a pitted road under the blistering sun

Parched and sweaty Hagen faces backwards Ambu turns around
and speaks to him

AMBU
Christian behold the holy city
of al-Quds sacred to all Muslims

HAGEN
What do I care

ARI
I believe you infidels call it
Jerusalem

Now Hagen is interested He turns and stands to get a good
view

HAGEN’S POV JERUSALEM

The small city covers a hilltop in a landscape of barren and
rocky terrain Minarets soar above the stone battlements The
setting sun reflects off the Dome of the Rock

HAGEN

continues to stare unexpectedly affected as the cart trundles
down the road toward the distant city

EXT THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM - NIGHT

By night the torchlit streets swarm with life The city is a
true melange of three faiths

A MUEZZIN calls the evening prayer from a minaret Faithful
MOSLEMS kneel on prayer rugs Hagen gazes from the cart as they
pass the WAILING WALL where JEWS stand and pray

HAGEN
Jews can worship here

ARI
Of course Christians as well

Ari points to an ancient church with a strange dome shaped like
a fools cap

ARI
Here is the church where the True
Cross is kept Does it not look
familiar
turns to Hagen)
Like in a dream

As Hagen gazes up at the famous church a candle-bearing
procession of ORTHODOX MONKS crosses their path led by
THEODOSIUS a long-bearded patriarch For an instant the
piercing eyes of Theodosius fix on Hagen as though he knows him
from another time and place

Hagen studies the old monk troubled by a sense of deja-vu
EXT A JERUSALEM STREET EMIR IBN KHALDUN‘S PALACE - NIGHT

The cart enters a small courtyard teeming with activity Horses
are groomed and tended A spitted lamb is turned over an open
fire Goats mill in pens awaiting slaughter Ropes hung with
clothes crisscross above Most of the people are Africans
Their laughter the chant of women pounding millet flour and
the general tone suggests a native village

TWO AFRICAN GUARDS

approaching Ambu in stature greet Ambu Hagen is beckoned down
from the wagon and they look him over joking with Ambu in their
native tongue

Ari is called by his Uncle YACUB an elderly man who stands on
a balcony above

YACUB
Ari

Ari whispers to Hagen

ARI
My uncle is calling me to the
palace
(his looks plead)
Dont make trouble they’11l whip
you

Ari moves away and Hagen is led toward the slave quarters
EXT A PALACE STAIRWAY NIGHT

Ari climbs a short flight of stairs to where his uncle is
waiting His uncle looks down as Hagen is led inside

YACUB
What did you pay for him

ARI
Using the skills you taught me
I paid only a just price

Knowing Ari’s cons his uncle rolls his eyes and turns away

YACUB
God forbid your Frank escapes
It will be our necks

ARI
I have spoken with him He is
content and willing to serve

INT IBN KHALDUN’S SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

‘With a sudden explosion of force Hagen snatches the lead chain
from Ambus guard The other guard tries to grab him and Hagen
slams him back against the wall But he makes no attempt to
run Facing Ambu who looms in front of him ready to take him
on Hagen speaks reasonably

HAGEN
I wont be led like a dog Point
the way I‘il follow

Ambu motions the guards back and beckons Hagen to follow They
start down a hallway

Ambu unlocks a barred door Hagen enters a hallway with roome
along the sides Slaves and their families live here Food

is cooked in the hall babies ery and curious children peer from
the doorways

A pair of African women stare curiously at Hagen sharing joke
in their native tongue

Hagen is led to a small room with no door Ambu whispers to
the men and they remove Hagen’s chains Ambu then points to
the room and with his palms clasped make a gesture of sleep
Hagen nods and enters

INT HAGEN’S ROOM’ NIGHT

Hagen crosses to a bed made of woven mat and sits down He
gazes up at the window A crescent moon shines through the
bars The vague sound of music and a girl’s laughter drifts
to Hagen’s solitude from somewhere in the palace

INT IBN KHALDUN’S PALACE - DAY

CLOSE ON A SMALL TREE MADE OF JEWELS AND JADE

Countless mechanical birds rendered in enamels and precious
gems bob and move on their perches as they sing

A CARACAL CAT

with an emerald studded collar watches the birds with its large
green eyes while a delicate feminine hand strokes its head

A camera move reveals a BEAUTIFUL GIRL in her mid-twenties who
strokes the animal Her large liquid eyes gazing languidly from
behind a silken veil

THE TREE OF BIRDS

stands on a small table attended by an elegantly attired Nubian
boy of perhaps ten AL-AFDAL a somewhat fey courtier in
Damascene dress stands to one side displaying the gift for the
benefit of the girl and her father IBN KHALDUN

ALAFDAL
Dugaq lives in the hope this gift
will entertain you and your
daughter

Seated beside his daughter on a divan that overlooks a
magnificent garden Ibn Khaldun is perhaps sixty His
expression reflects wisdom graced with humor His dress is
simple yet elegant subtle colors rendered in the finest cloth

IBN KHALDUN
A lovely gift is it not Leila
LEILA nods a tacit agreement Al-Afdal steps forward and opens
the ivory and gold covers of a small painting that depicts a
ruler of obese dimensions seated on a jewel encrusted throne

LEILA

It is clever But I
songs of real birds
to inspire happiness
obligation

AlAfdal seems slightly stung
places the portrait on a small

prefer the
songs meant
and not

but covers He speaks as he
table facing Leila

AL-AFDAL
Keep this likeness that you may
know Dugag That you take even
the slightest pleasure in his
humble gift will give him great
joy

Al-Afdal salaams and leaves Leila snatches away her veil and
kicks the miniature portrait onto the floor Her anger only
enhances her disturbing beauty

IBN KHALDUN
I have seen subtler rejections

LEILA
Dugaq is a slug His amorous
intentions are an insult I

wouldn’t marry the man if he sent
me the pyramids

IBN KHALDUN
Dugaq rules only Damascus The
pyramids would have to come from
the caliph of Cairo

LEILA
He’s equally loathsome Don’t
encourage him

Khaldun smiles at her

IBN KHALDUN
And whom should I encourage

LEILA
When I know you‘ll know

INT IBN KHALDUNS PALACE - DUSK

Hagen cleaned up and wearing baggy Arab style pants and a silk
vest walks with Ari and Ambu through a beautiful tiled
courtyard

His eyes scan the graceful beauty of Khaldun’s palace As they
pass an alabaster fountain they are watched by a magnificent
Argus pheasant in full display

INT IBN KHALDUN’S OFFICES - NIGHT

Hagen enters with Ari and Ambu The room is large and filled
with shelves of books Ari‘s uncle is gazing through a bronze
instrument for measuring the positions of stars at an open
window He approaches and looks Hagen up and down

YACUB
He has an odd smell Do they
bathe

ARI

Not as often as we uncle
Ibn Khaldun enters Ari Yacub and Ambu salaam at his approach
ARI
My Lord this is the FrankHe
is called Hagen

Yacub notes that Hagen makes no move

YACUB
Bow to your master the emir Ibn
Khaldun Lord of this palace

Hagen manages a sullen barely noticeable nod as Ibn Khaldun
faces him

IBN KHALDUN
I‘m told you were part of the
Christian army that now invades
our lands

ARI
Pressed into arms my lord He
had no choice

IBN KHALDUN
Let him speak I would have al-
Hagen tell what drives these men
Is it truly a war about shrines

HAGEN
For a few

IBN KHALDUN
And for you

Hagen stares at Ibn Khaldun for a beat

HAGEN
I came for the gold that hangs
around your neck

Ibn Khaldun smiles but Yacub reacts with offense

YACUB
Barbarian youll feel the whip
for speaking thus to your emir

Yacub snaps his fingers signaling a guard forward

IBN KHALDUN
No Yacub I prefer a man who
states his mind over one who’s
been whipped into skillful deceit
(to Ambu)
Have his training begin at once

Ambu salaams an Hagen makes a half-hearted effort They leave

YACUB
You trust this creature

IBN KHALDUN
Not yet but perhaps I will
EXT IBN KHALDUN’S PALACE - A COURTYARD - DAY

Hagen stands in a courtyard wearing only a loin cloth ambu
hands him a Masai spear and a shield of rhino hide

He fits the shield over Hagen’s arm and gives him the spear

Ambu arms himself with the same weapons Facing Hagen he drums
the spear against the shield making an alarming noise that ends
with a wild shout He indicates that Hagen should try the same

Hagen drums awkwardly on the shield and shouts Ambu laughs
Muttering in his own language he adjusts Hagen’s hold on the
spear and gestures him to try again

INT IBN KHALDUN’S PALACE - A CORRIDOR - DAY

The tingling of bangles and the whisper of bare feet on marble
floors announce the appearance of Leila and her slave SHEBA

a lovely Ethiopian They stop at a corner and shush each other
Peering around Sheba sees a BLACK EUNUCH dozing against the
opposite wall

SHEBA
Shhhh the eunuch is almost
asleep

LEILA

Why should I sneak from the harem
to see a slave Why is he so
special

SHEBA
You must see him These Franks
are a race of giants

Sheba checks the Eunuch who has begun to snore Stifling
giggles the girls sneak past and race up a flight of stairs

EXT KHALDUN’S PALACE - A COURTYARD - DAY

The spear rattles against Ambus shield

Facing him Hagen too has mastered the spear rattle

AMBU increases the pitch then with a wild scream charges
HAGEN

blocks the charge and swings at Ambu who leaps raising both
feet to allow the spear to swish underneath He brings the
spear down and-Hagen blocks it then leaps back Now Hagen
faces him rattling his own spear against the shield

INT A TOWER ROOM - DAY

Leila stands beside Sheba gazing down at Hagen through an
ornately latticed window

SHEBA

See a monster
THE COMBAT TRAINING
Hagen charges feints and trips Ambu As Ambu goes down he
vaults on his hands and kicks Hagen with the soles of both feet
Hagen falls in a cloud of dust He rises and Ambu throws down
his shield and spear A short charge and they are locked in
a wrestling grip pitting their strength one against the other
Hagen gets a leg behind Ambu and throws him down
Both men laugh as Hagen extends a hand and helps him up
LEILA
peers intently at Hagen
HAGEN AND AMBU
step under a shade and are handed buckets by other slaves Hagen
dumps water over his body and pulls away his loin cloth to wash
himself
LEILA AND SHEBA

faces pressed to the window exchange a brief glance and stifle
the urge to giggle

HAGEN

Now rinses himself with another bucket As he towels off his
look goes to the tower window

POV HAGEN - THE TOWER

Leila and Sheba are unaware that their silhouettes are visible
in the backlight

HAGEN

gazes hard his eyes climbing the silhouetted form of Leila
until he meets her gaze

LEILA’S LARGE EYES

stare back at him
HAGENS

expression softens

LEILA MOVES SUDDENLY BACK

as if Hagen’s look carried some kind of electrical charge Sheba
looks at her curiously

SHEBA

Leila stares ahead lost in a whirlwind of forbidden thoughts
HAGEN

remains staring as Leila’s figure disappears into the shadows
of the tower He ventures a trace of a smile

EXT A BATTLEGROUND - OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF ANTIOCH - DUSK

The siege is over The city has fallen to the Crusaders Fires
burn along the battlements Mounted knights thunder past rows
of stakes set outside the walls upon which Moslems are impaled

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE ANTIOCH
EXT THE STREETS OF ANTIOCH - DAY

Common soldiers rage through streets looting the houses in
search of food

A group of soldiers wander a deserted market place Violent
fighting breaks out as they search desperately through empty
wheat bins

Foot soldiers fight over a half empty bag of grain One
bludgeons the other and takes the bag stuffing raw grain into
his mouth before others can take it away Another scoops up

a rat from inside a grain barrel and runs with it before the
other can take it away

In the streets a pack of feral dogs feed on the rotting corpse
of a woman Suddenly a group of soldiers emerge from a side
street Seeing the pack of dogs the soldiers rush them One
is cornered and caught by the soldiers He is held yelping
in terror as they begin butchering him

EXT ATOP THE WALLS OF ANTIOCH - DAY

Emmich and Waldemar walk above a courtyard where pathetic groups
of Moslem women and children huddle around small fires

WALDEMAR
A city stripped of foodOur
victory feast will be on jackal
and carrion crow

Emmich looks down as several women some with infants in their
arms extend their hands and beg for food

EMMICH
I see no shortage of meat in
Antioch I see ewes that carry
ample flesh and tender lambs still
fattening at the nipple

Waldemar almost laughs at the absurdity of the idea

WALDEMAR
The Moslem civilians
EMMICH
Cut into strips salted and
driedwho would know or care
WALDEMAR

Godfrey would care

EMMICH
While Godfrey waits on the coast
for grain ships a starving army
will prefer my stew to his
promises

Waldemar gazes down into the courtyard then he looks at Emmich
and shrugs “Why not’

EXT THE CRUSADER CAMP - DUSK

Steam wafts from huge pots of stew that boil over cook fires
as the hungry men of the crusader army wait in restless lines
to-be fed Order is maintained by club-wielding sergeants

THROUGH THE SMOKE OF THE COOK FIRES

Godfrey among a group of mounted knights returns from his
mission to find food They are weary and filthy with the dirt
of travel A few camels trail them with sacks of grain
GODFREY

catches the scent drifting from the stew pots He exchanges
a look with his men and rides ahead

A STEW POT IS STIRRED

As a ladle is lifted to serve a crowd of soldiers a human
jawbone is visible surfacing for an instant from the depths
of the gruel

GODFREY

looking into the pot covers his mouth fighting a sudden wave
of nausea

INT A BURNED-OUT BYZANTINE CHURCH - DAY

Church bells CLANG sourly CLOSE ON A GOLD CROSS in shafts of
sunlight gliding through clouds of incense smoke It tops a
staff carried by the Hermit Monk who leads a procession of
Crusader knights to an altar

ADHEMAR (VQO)
Antioch wherein preached St
Peter and St Paul is restored
to Christ

Godfrey in chain armor walks at the lead with a handful of his
men Emmich is immediately behind with Ivo and Waldemar They
are followed by a congregation of knights

Adhemar stands before the makeshift altar Icons have been set
up over Arab calligraphy that can still be’ seen on the walls
He faces the assemblage of knights who have reached the front
of the church

ADHEMAR
Months of siege are now rewarded
by peace and the restoration of
order Let us now pray for
further victories

Godfrey rises

GODFREY
Bishop How can our prayers be
answered until we purge ourselves
of those who have committed
heinous sins

ADHEMAR
Count Godfrey this is not the
time nor place for such
declarations

GODFREY
I believe God has limits to what
he allows in his name What he
has done to innocent civilians

Godfrey points at Emmich

GODFREY
He must be disavowed of his
oaths and cast from this crusade

There is a chorus of “No’s” from the knights and from the rank
and file Baldwin of Chartres steps forward

BALDWIN
Without Emmich wed have starved

“Sensing the support of those gathered including knights like
Baldwin formerly loyal to Godfrey Emmich faces his accuser

EMMICH
Can you deny that cruel acts are
a fact of war

ate

EMMICH (Contd)
We ravage lands and leave death
and destruction yet we are
favored with victory Is it not
proof that because our goal is
just the Lord forgives our
actions

There are shouts from the men “YesThe Lord
forgivesEmmich has fought bravely” Godfrey pushes to
Adhemar
GODFREY
(whispers)
Denounce his savagery Cast him
from us
ADHEMAR

We can’t afford to lose him We
can’t afford to fail

Adhemar raises his hand to quiet the men

ADHEMAR
Silence The Lord alone will
judge usIf we restore Jerusalem
to his kingdom God will forgive
what we have done for his cause

Cheers Emmich turn with his fist raised and shouts

EMMICH
Hear that men Whatever we do
hell forgive us

Adhemar turns avoiding Godfrey’s look and resumes the mass
From cheers and shouts of “Death to the Moslem filth” the
knights go to bendec knees and muttered prayers

INT THE GOVERNORS BATHS JERUSALEM - DAY

In a magnificent tiled courtyard the elite of Jerusalem relax
beside the pool where they have bathed Servants attend them
with offerings of fruit and delicacies ‘

IFTIKHAR the mousy little governor of Jerusalem paces before
them

IFTIKHAR
I have twenty thousand Askaris
to defend the walls and at
Antioch they had twice that
number

DJARVAT thin and dark with intense burning eyes stands beside
the pool draped in the black robes of a fundamentalist muilah
He listens as Iftikhar speaks to Ibn Khaldun

IFTIKHAR
Emir Khaldun you are skilled in
warfare Advise us Draft a plan
for our defense

DJARVAT
Find a means to slaughter these
infidels before their stench
defiles our shrines

Ibn Khaldun smiles at Djarvats fiery rhetoric

IBN KHALDUN
Our horsemen and archers are
superior to theirs If it is to
be a battle we should meet them
in the field

IFTIKHAR
But the cost of mounting such a
force

AKIVA an elderly Rabbi speaks from among a group of Jewish
elders

AKIVA
The people of Jerusalem cannot
bear the burden of more taxes

There is some disgruntled mumbling’ among the gathering -Djarvat
crosses toward a repulsive elephantine pudding of a man who
reclines near a large tray of sweets He is DUQAQ of Damascus
and his portrait did not begin to suggest his depravity His
retainer al-Afdal stands nearby

DJARVAT
Our gracious friend Dugaq commands
an army of horsemen and
archersOnly a day’s ride away

Dugaq licks a sweet from his fingers as he faces Djarvat

DUQAQ
The soldiers of Damascus are only
for the defense of Damascus

DJARVAT
The pillage of Moslem shrines hy
infidels means nothing to you

DUQAQ
(a smug smile)
Djarvat as you mullahs are fond
of reminding me’ I am not a pious
man

74

DUQAQ (Contd)
(he searches for another
sweet as he speaks)
But there is something that might
entice me to defend Jerusalem
Emir Khaldun knows of my desire

The men exchange glances as if caught by a riddle

IBN KHALDUN
He means my daughter Leila

IFTIKHAR
Then give her and blessed by the
union
The others chime in “Yes give him the girl”

IBN KHALDUN
I have promised my daughter that
in marriage her will is to be her
own

DJARVAT
No womans will is her own

Dugag appears insulted There is a general grumbling from those
assembled

DJARVAT
For a daughter‘’s pride are we to
bear desecration of our faith

IBN KHALDUN
Christians coming to pray will
not desecrate Islam We should
examine the possibility of a
truce

IFTIKHAR
These are barbarians War is
inevitable

IBN KHALDUN
of the wars Ive fought none were
inevitable All were
regrettable

Ibn Khaldun faces the others and continues

IBN KHALDUN
We of this city are wise in the
skills of negotiation and
compromise We have played
conquerors before as others
play chess

IBN KHALDUN (Contd)
These Christians are exhausted
by their long struggles weakened
by their journey beset with
quarrels and intrigues1I say
we meet them and offer peace

IFTIKHAR
Let them enter the city without
a fight

IBN KHALDUN
Enter unarmed as pilgrims to
worship By the Prophets law
all faiths worship here

AKIVA
We are all the children of
Abraham We Jews support an
effort for peace

Djarvat laughs out loud in mockery

DJARVAT
You Jews will die with this coward
by the same Christian sword Allah
calls for victory not compromise
with infidels

Djarvat and his following walk away There is a beat of silence
then Iftikhar speaks

IFTIKHAR
Go Ibn KhaldunSave us if you

In his small room Hagen lies on his bed awake A breeze stirs
and he hears a girl’s laughter He turns trying to settle into
sleep but the creak of a door hinge moving in the wind
distracts him After a few seconds he rises

Stepping to the door Hagen looks down a hallway and sees

EXT A COURTYARD NEAR THE STABLES - NIGHT

Hagen exits the slave quarters and moves through the shadows
After glancing up at the walls surrounding the slave compound
he climbs a tree and onto a roof

EXT THE PALACE ROOF - NIGHT

Pigeons flutter nervously a few break into flight as Hagen
passes a huge loft

Hagen looks toward a far wall which overlooks the landscape
surrounding the city He moves over the confusion of parapets
and corbeled roofs that make up the palace

His foot dislodges a section of brick that falls into a
courtyard He freezes then moves on

He moves along a ledge under a series of windows

POV HAGEN

Hagen’s view is directly down into the harem the night is warm
and three beautiful odalisques nearly nude sleep on divans
around a fountain A small antelope wanders among them nibbling
left-overs from trays of fruit

HAGEN

momentarily loses his drive to escape as he gazes at the
sleeping forms He moves to another window a short distance
away and peers in

POV HAGEN

Leila beneath a silken gauze lies asleep on her bed in the
middle of a room of white marble inlaid with precious stones
The image is like a Persian miniature of arresting sensual
beauty

HAGEN

is caught He stares at Leila captivated
LEILA

sighs and turns in her sleep as she dreams Her small delicate
hands caress her shoulders then she is still again

HAGEN SEES

a small balcony on a lower level that opens into’ Leila’s room
After a moment of indecision he climbs down a ledge and makes
his way towards it When he reaches it he peers inside

ANGLE - LEILAS ROOM

The bed is empty As Hagen’s eyes search the room Leilas face
suddenly appears from behind a curtain directly in front of him
Her dark eyes stare into his

Hagen’s eyes quickly scan her body then return to her face

His eyes lock on hers and for seconds neither moves She
studies him quickly as though committing his face to her memory
Then she slowly closes a shutter that separates them

Hagen is tempted to reach forward and tear away the flimsy
ornately carved wood but instead he backs away

EXT THE ROOF - NIGHT

Climbing to the edge of the palace Hagen gazes out at the
freedom which lies beyond A length of his makeshift rope
dangles from his shirt as he ponders escape The wind stirs
his hair and his gaze is drawn back toward Leila’s room
ANGLE LEILA’S BALCONY WINDOW

Two large eyes watch Hagen

INT THE SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Hagen re-enters the slave quarters and walks toward his room

INT HAGENS ROOM - NIGHT

Hagen hurls himself down on his bed For several seconds he
lays on his back staring at the ceiling then he rolls over and
faces the wall trying to shut Leila out of his thoughts

As he tries for sleep a small hand gently touches his shoulder
Hagen turns quickly and sees--

SHEBA

Leila’s slave is smiling at him Hagen is dumbstruck

SHEBA
Al-Hagen the princess Leila sent
me

HAGEN
The princess sent you

SHEBA

(giggles)

Yesto be with youshe says

you are lonely -That you wander
like a tomcat in the night Is
it not so

Hagen can’t believe his eyes She is like a vision

HAGEN
Who are you

SHEBA
I am Sheba I am an odalisque

Hagen doesn’t know the word Sheba laughs lightly

SHEBA
I am schooled in the way of
pleasure al-Hagen The princess
knows that I too am sometimes very
lonelyAnd she has curiosity

about you
HAGEN
Curiosity
SHEBA
It is only through me that she
can know of menby what I say

of the way you feel
Sheba begins touching Hagen’s body
SHEBA
Of your strengthAre you sorry
she has curiosity about you
Hagen reaches out and touches her bare arm with his fingertips

HAGEN
No

Sheba smiles
SHEBA

May I stay with you If you send
me away the princess will weep

HAGEN
And if you stay she will be
happy

SHEBA

Yes She would hear of our
pleasure and rejoice in it

HAGEN
You people are very different from
us

SHEBA

Perhaps not so different as you
think

He draws Sheba’s face to his own and gives her a gentle kiss
Her hands begin a sensual caressing of his body that immediately
arouses his desire

light armor helps Leila inside

HAGEN
Where is he sending the princess

ARI
To his brother’s estate near
Nablus Dugaq of Demascus still
wants her as his wife Ibn
Khaldun fears she might be taken
while he is away

Ari takes Hagen aside and speaks in a whisper

ARI
I persuaded him that you should
be part of the guard You know
what that means

HAGEN
Escape
ARI
(nods)
I ask that you first deliver her
to safetyThe man trusts me

Deceiving him does not come easy

Hagen nods agreement

ARI
Then ride North It’s said the
Crusaders now cover the land like
locusts

HAGEN
And you

ARI
I am to be part of Ibn Khaldun’s
peace mission to the Crusaders

HAGEN

He’s a victim of noble
character

HAGEN
And when his noble character gets
him killed what about you

ARI

With you on one side and me on
the other how can we lose -- Good
luck Hagen

Ari grabs him and gives him a kiss Hagen hugs him back not
fighting it

watches Hagen

and shining neck guard of chain His muscular arms are bare
from the shoulder and flex as he holds the reins

an instant Then he spurs his horse ahead

Leila looks atShéba who has seen her looking at him Sheba
smiles

LEILA
You lucky little devil

They both laugh

SHEBA
Does the princess envy the
odalisque

LEILA
(whispers gently
teasing)
The princess envies the freedom
of her slave Was he

He released the desire in his
flesh but not in his heart He
will still wander in the night

Leila says nothing She turns her head and gazes out through
the opening in the howdah

EXT A CAMP - NIGHT

Gnawing a lamb bone Hagen walks from the guards who laugh and
joke in their native African tongue He passes Leila’s tent
where her shadow moves in the light of a lantern

HAGEN CLIMBS ROCKS

above the camp and settles to eat Picking at his bone he looks
down and sees--

THE REAR OF LEILAS TENT

The crisp shadow of Leila’s nude form stands in the center
She laughs reacting to the cold water of a sponge bath

HAGEN
smiles and pitches away the lamb
INT LEILA’S TENT - NIGHT

As Sheba toys with the homing pigeons Leila rinses the soap
from her smooth skin The silhouette of a man appears behind
her on the tent

The silhouette draws a knife cuts a long slit in the tent and
steps through

It is Djarvat

He lunges for Leila but Sheba steps between and tries to fight
him off Djarvat stabs Sheba in the belly and throws her to
the ground Leila is about to scream when Djarvat covers her
mouth with his hand

OUTSIDE IN THE CAMP

Black clad figures move to a trio of sleeping guards slitting
their throats without waking them Another of Djarvat’s men
slips a garrote around the throat of a guard and draws it tight
AMBU

checks the horses to see that they are well tied Suddenly an
arrow strikes him in the back Three more arrows strike him
and he SHOUTS out with warning and pain

EXT HILL OVERLOOKING THE CAMP - NIGHT

Hagen lying on his back looking at the stars scrambles to his
feet on hearing Ambu’s cry He looks down at the camp then
dashes toward it

HAGEN

runs past the bodies of the slain guards and comes upon Ambu
who lies on the ground dying With his last breath Ambu looks
up at his comrade and gasps

AMBU

Hagen takes Ambu’s spear and races through the camp

INT LEILAS TENT - NIGHT

Djarvat restrains Leila as three of his black-clad followers
tie her up Grabbing Djarvats dagger from his waistband she
slashes the face of one of his men

Diarvat seizes her wrist painfully forces her to drop the
knife then whacks her across the face as the others finish
tying her up

EXT THE CAMP - NIGHT

IN A SERIES OF SHOTS

A black-robed archer loads his bow as Hagen sprints through the

camp Before he can release the arrow Hagen hurls the spear
and skewers him

Leila is dragged by Djarvat and two men toward their horses
Another follows with the cage of homing pigeons

Hagen runs into view ahead of them One of Djarvat’s men
scimitar in hand spins to face Hagen who is unarmed Hagen
charges in an insane frenzy grabs the man and smashes his skull
with a blow of his fist

Leila her hands and feet tied is slung over a horse in front
of Djarvat

Hagen snatches a tent pole and rushes Djarvat and the others
as they scramble to escape

Slamming one man in the face he breaks the pole He drives
the splintered end through a second man

Then from behind HOSSEIN the largest of Djarvats men slams
Hagen with the iron pot from the fire Hagen spins stunned
and is slammed again to the ground

Two other men jump him Hagen is held face down and garroted
Djarvat gasps as he sees --
--- the huge cross on Hagens back

twists fighting for breath
POV HAGEN

He sees Leila held by two of Djarvat’s men A donkey is led

up Djarvat steps to the animal and while glaring at Hagen
he draws a dagger across the creatures throat

EXT THE CAMP SITE - MORNING

A few vultures have settled on the rocks gazing down at the
dead which litter the camp Flies BUZZ in the morning sun as
the CAMERA PANS to reveal the carcass of the donkey

From the anus of the animal projects the head of aman It is
Hagen He has been sewn inside the carcass and left to feed
the maggots and hyenas that wander the camp sniffing at
corpses

HAGEN

groans as filthy slime and the gasses of decomposition bubble

up around his neck from the heat-bloated carcass A carpet of
flies lifts from his face as he strains to move his head The
CAMERA PANS to show his full predicament heavy leather thongs
lace the belly of the animal and Hagen’s hands protrude through
slits cut on either side

His wrists are bound with rawhide and his feet thrust through
holes in the animal’s chest are tied at the ankles

A few feet away a HYENA stares at Hagen giggling with hunger-
induced curiosity When it approaches to sniff Hagen’s hands
he shouts and the creature backs off with a psychotic whine

HAGEN

strains tilting his head to see his hands With great effort
he flexes and draws them in His bound wrists squeeze against
the donkey’s belly causing liquid putrefaction and bubbles of
gas to well up around his neck

FROM THE BELLY SLIT

the same nauseating ooze flows over the bindings of Hagen’s
wrists When the rawhide is soaked Hagen twists until he can
move one wrist He flexes again forcing out more ooze Again
he works to move his wrist

EXT THE CAMP SITE (LATER)

The sun hangs low in the sky Hyenas bolder now and joined

by jackals surround the donkey carcass Hagen shouts hoarsely
as the circle of scavengers tightens seeking bites of living
flesh

HAGEN

flexes compressing the carcass and spurting out more liquid

A HYENA

lunges and snaps at Hagen’s hands now covered with a layered
frosting of putrescence Lubricated by the slippery ooze one
binding has been worked well up onto Hagens hand close to the
knuckle of his thumb

ANOTHER HYENA

with the most powerful jaws in the animal kingdom easily tears
a large chunk of meat from the donkey’s throat near Hagen’s
exposed feet -- as he shouts and wiggles his toes

A HYENA

snatches the buttock near Hagen’s face tearing away flesh as
Hagen shouts growls and grimaces to drive him of€

the pack of skulking hyenas moves around him with ever-growing
excitement
8S

A HYENA

moves in intent on Hagen’s hands As the beast lunges Hagen
writhes and with all his strength tears his hand from the
binding

As the animal leaps back Hagen’s hands grab the slit in the
carcass and with a bellow he begins tearing it open

He pulls the bindings off his feet Dripping putrescence and
gore he emerges from the carcass like some creature-born DEMI
GOD

As Hagen drags himself away the hyenas savagely attack the
exposed donkey innards

EXT THE DESERT - PRE-DAWN

Wind blows a veil of sand over low hills barren of vegetation

enters and walks toward her with a menacing gait

LEILA
Ravage me and my father will have
you stoned

DUARVAT
I would not defile myself with
a woman during jihad And never
with the daughter of a coward

Djarvat removes a pigeon from the cage taken from the camp
DJARVAT
This bird will carry a note to
your father

As he talks he removes a small piece of paper from a sleeve
pocket

DJARVAT
It demands he abandon his pathetic
effort at truce and launch
warUnless he wants your lovely
face cut away and sent to him as
a remembrance

Djarvat leans down
DJARVAT
How do you suppose he’ll react
to a note scented by your perfume
As Djarvat rubs the note along Leila’s cheek she suddenly turn
and bites his hand like a wild animal She hangs on like a
bulldog as Djarvat twists and kicks her to free himself

He glares at her his rage tinged with fear then leaves with
the pigeon

high in a nearby tree

He gets an idea

reaches his spear up into the tree and stabs the hive He pulls
it away from the branch and waggles the spear back and forth
violently shaking the bees The insects swarm from the nest
like a loud dark cloud covering the spear and getting close

to Hagen

Using the spear like a vaulting pole Hagen flings the hive into

queen

them into a stampede As they course around him he and Leila
grab the manes of two beasts and mount them bareback

The attacking soldiers are blocked by the charging horses which
flood through the camp like a raging river

Hagen and Leila gallop away amid the thundering herd as
Djarvat’s tribesmen chase them on foot

Djarvat watches infuriated as his hostage and his steeds
disappear over a crest He shakes the soldier standing next
to him who is still nursing his bee stings

DJARVAT
The horses Get the horses

EXT A VERDANT STREAM - DAY

Leila sits on a rock under a canopy of lush foliage washing
her feet as Hagen waters the horse and fills a water bag He
crosses to her and offers it

She drinks

LETLA
My uncle’s estate is no longer
safe My father will be in
Caesaria near the coast trying
to send envoys to the Crusaders
You must take me there

Leila looks at him and drinks again She speaks between gulps
LEILA
Youll be well rewarded My
father is very generous with
slaves
Hagen takes the water bag back

HAGEN
I’m no longer a slave

As Hagen drinks Leila stiffens slightly with concern

LEILA
Does that mean you are no longer
loyal

HAGEN
It means I’m first of all loyal
to myself

Leila studies him a beat
a
vey

LEILA
Listen I have need of you and
you have need of me

Hagen regards her almost bemused

LEILA
On your own what chance do you
have to find your fellow
barbarians Do you know the way

HAGEN
To the North

Leila suddenly laughs uncontrollably at the notion Hagen is
sullen at her arrogance

LEILA

Thats good To the North This
is you

(imitates)
“Please Effendi could you show
me the way North so I can join
the infidel invaders They’1ll
show you They’ll put your head
on a pike and face it North

Leila laughs again Hagen is forced to smile as he watches her
She sees his smile and stops laughing

LEILA
Take me and you‘ll have your
freedom By my faith I swear it

Hagen walks her horse over to her and boosts her up He then
climbs onto his own mount

HAGEN
So which way is Caesaria

Leila answers with a smile

LEILA
Follow me

EXT IBN KHALDUN’S CAMP NEAR CAESARIA - DAY

A group of tents on an open plain fly the various banners of
Islam

AN OLD MAN

hurries through the camp past potentates and advisors He comes
to an elaborate tent where he is stopped by a guard In his
hands ‘he holds the pigeon

OLD MAN
I must see the Emir This bird
has come with a message of great
urgency

INT THE TENT - DAY

Ibn Khaldun sits before Yacub Ari and others holding the
scented letter from Djarvat The Old Man who brought the pigeon
stands in the background gently stroking the bird The mood

in the tent is very tense After several seconds Ibn Khaldun
turns to Yacub

IBN KHALDUN
Recall the envoys There will
be no talk of truce
The Emir looks at his counsellors with pain in his eyes
IBN KHALDUN
May Allah forgive meI have no
choice
The men say nothing sensing the agony of his decision
EXT A MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY

Hagen and Leila now wearing a rind of dust ride wearily
through the day Seeing a stand of trees ahead Hagen speaks

HAGEN
Wait here

Leila waits while Hagen draws his sword and rides ahead

REACHING THE TREES

Hagen peers around in all directions There is no chance of

ambush and he waves to Leila He watches as she rides up with

the grace of a born horsewoman and they continue side by side
LEILA

AlHagen when you were taken
slave were you taken from a wife

HAGEN
No
LEILA
There is no one
HAGEN
No
LEILA

In your land were you a noble

HAGEN
No I was a serf
LEILA
You say that with pride
HAGEN
Why not
LEILA
So you have no use for a spoiled
princess
HAGEN
You ride wellWe haven’t eaten

or rested and you don’t complain
Maybe you’re not really a

princess

LEILA
Iam I am descended from the
Bedouina desert people whose
lives are very hard And I too
am proud

EXT A WILDERNESS - DUSK

Hagen and Leila descend from the mountains into a beautiful
alpine valley Forested mountains rise on each side

In the distance in the direction which they travel a small
farmhouse can be seen

AS THEY APPROACH THE FARMHOUSE

an OLD FARMER and his WIFE emerge and smile a friendly greeting
INT THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Hagen and Leila are seated on the floor eating stew with flat
breads The Old Farmer and his Wife watch them occasionally
tempting them with choice pieces of meat

The Old Farmer notices that Hagen’s plate is empty

OLD FARMER
More

Hagen smiles at him

HAGEN
Iocant eat more It was very
good thank you

OLD FARMER
There is a room above the stable

You and your wife must stay the
night
2
Leila and Hagen exchange a look Hagen senses what might be
an uncomfortable situation
HAGEN
We are grateful but we have no

time

The Old Farmer nods acceptance After a beat of silence Leila
suddenly speaks

LEILA
NoIm very tired

Hagen is surprised at her response
LEILA
My husband and I will accept your
hospitality
Leila smiles at Hagen who feels momentarily very awkward
EXT THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The Old Farmer walks them to the stable gives them a lantern
and wishes them good night

OLD FARMER
May God bless you both

A wind stirs in the trees that shade the farm courtyard as Hagen
and Leila enter the stable

INT THE STABLE - NIGHT

Hagen bolts the door against the wind then he raises the lantern
and looks around A simple ladder leads to a loft above the
stalls Aside from several horses that watch them curiously
they are very much alone

Hagen offers Leila the lantern

HAGEN
I‘ll sleep here on the hay
LEILA
No
Hagen looks at her
LEILA

To them we’re man and wife If
you sleep here they’1l think we
quarreled

Leila takes the lantern

LEILA
Come

She climbs the ladder Hagen looks up as she hikes her robe
exposing the white skin of her legs He follows

INT THE LOFT NIGHT

They climb into the loft and Leila sets down the lantern Seeing
a roll of cotton bedding she takes it and spreads it on the
straw Hagen watches her but remains back a ways

Leila removes her head covering and begins sorting her hair with
her fingers In the soft light of the lamp her beauty is
breathtaking

LEILA
In the palace when I first looked
at youI wanted you

HAGEN

You don’t know me

LEILA
I know what I feelHave you felt
nothing for me

HAGEN
What a slave feels for his
mistress

Leila cuts through his feigned indifference with a look both
knowing and innocent

LEILA
Just tell me that you’ve wanted
me

HAGEN

Ive wanted youvery much
Leila takes a jewelled Hand of Fatima from around her neck

HAGEN
Whats this

She speaks as she fastens the chain on Hagen’s neck

LEILA
A -gift that a bride gives to the
man who first shows her love
I have always feared that on this
night fate would put me with
someone for whom I felt no desire
But now I thank Allah who has
put me with you

Hagen smiles

HAGEN
I thank Allah too

She reaches her hand toward Hagen He takes it in his own and
lowers himself beside her He gently touches her cheek

Leila raises her face to his and their lips touch

LEILA
I have waited so long

Hagen’s arms envelope her They kiss and he lays her back on
the bedding He savors the softness of her skin as he opens
her robes exposing her breasts Leila’s passion suddenly
surges and she pulls Hagen close drawing him to the act of
love

EXT THE VALLEY - DAWN

The soft light of earliest dawn brings pastel hues to the valley
and the small farm

INT THE STABLE - DAWN

Leila is awake studying Hagen as he sleeps She reaches for
a pitcher of water and raises it to drink It is empty

EXT STABLE AREA - DAWN

Leila exits the stable like a peasant bride carrying the
pitcher Crossing to the well she notices that the sheep and
cowS are running loose bleating and lowing with agitation

Leila lowers the bucket into the well when she sees the Old
Farmer and his Wife lying on the ground dead

WALDEMAR

appears behind her His lecherous grin says it all He likes
what he sees

WALDEMAR
Good morning

Leila spins and her eyes quickly dart around looking for escape
Three more of Emmich’s men stand behind her A PIMPLY YOUTH
holds several pillaged chickens by the legs and a POTATO-FACED
PEASANT fingers cream from a bucket An UGLY BRUTE with a
toothless grin drops his sack and massages his codpiece

Leila slams Waldemar with the pitcher and tries to run but she
is caught by the Ugly Brute A huge chain mail glove covers
her mouth

Waldemar steps up his face bleeding He glances around the
farmyard then sees a manure pile

WALDEMAR
Over there Face down in the shit
heap with her ass in the air

The Pimply Youth still stroking his codpiece giggles
w
UI

PIMPLY YOUTH
I’m second

They push Leila toward the manure and shove her to her knees
while Waldemar unties his pants

As her face is pushed toward the maggoty filth she chews at
the gloved hand Kicking and writhing her face is almost in
the manure The other knights howl with laughter The Pimply
Youth looks around and sees

POV PIMPLY YOUTH
The rest of the foraging party is heading in their direction
THE PIMPLY YOUTH
speaks to Waldemar
PIMPLY YOUTH

Hurry or well have to share her
with the others

Waldemar heaves up her skirts and positions himself to sodomize
er

Suddenly a trident pitchfork strikes him from behind A prong
appears from his face another from his throat stifling his
scream of agony

HAGEN
stands in the hayloft above and draws a scimitar
WALDEMAR

rises clawing wildly at the prong while he chokes on his own
blood As he spins the handle slams the face of the Ugly Brute
holding Leila She breaks free and runs

HAGEN

vaults down to a shed roof leaps into the farm yard and
charges the’men The Pimply Youth rushes him sword drawn
A blow from Hagen’s scimitar drops him

HAGEN
(to Leila)
Go Ride to your father

The Ugly Brute slams Hagen with a club knocking him down Leila
runs for the stable

As the Ugly Brute raises his club to brain him Hagen drives
the scimitar into his gut The Brute falls and his hands lock
on Hagen’s throat Hagen works the scimitar and the Brute
gurgles and dies

LEILA

rides out of the stable with an extra horse -- but a dozen
Crusaders have already charged into the farmyard and are
converging on Hagen Powerless to save him Leila gallops away

HAGEN

turns and sees above him a horse reared back on two legs like
a dragon The beast strikes out with its hooves pummeling him
in the head and chest Hagen falls to the ground reeling

Crusaders draw up and surround him keeping him distant with
their lance points Ivo Emmich’s other lackey gallops through
the formation and looks down at his prisoner After a beat of
disbelief he smiles

Ivo
Now here indeed is a prize

EXT ROCKY PASS ABOVE THE FARM - DAY

Leila reaches the pass and turns Seeing that Hagen is taken
captive she chokes back sorrow and rides on

CAMERA CRANES UP to reveal the other side of the pass
DJARVAT AND HIS HORSEMEN

lie in wait for Leila on the opposing ridgetop Djarvat nods
and they ride down the slope

EXT THE CRUSADER CAMP - DAY

A vast plain covered with tents and makeshift dwellings
stretches before the eye as Ivo rides past Hagen is bound with
his arms yoked over a log A rope around his neck leads to
Ivo’s saddle and he is dragged at a trot

The men of the raiding party follow with carts of grain and
slaughtered carcasses of sheep

HAGEN

gazes around as he is led through the outer fringes of the camp
This is the realm of the peasants and pilgrims that follow and
serve the army

Their appearance has become more savage since leaving Europe
Some push forward glaring threateningly at the grain wagons
Four men try to pull a sack free They are beaten back by Ivo’s
men who seem inured to the face of savagery around them

HAGEN TURNS

at the sound of jeers and sees--

THE HARLOT WAGON

The whores howl and hoot at Hagen as he is pulled past Some
nurse babies and the faces of the filthy toddlers can be seen
peeking from behind their skirts

THE MADMAN
appears and recognizes Hagen

MADMAN
Hagen lives Risen from the dead
Lazarus Lazarus He has returned

HAGEN

is dragged on toward a small hill where the knights’ tents are
set each flying the pennant of his lord Godfreys banner is
the most common Knights emerge from their tents to see what
the excitement is about

Ivo leads Hagen into an area where Emmich’s colors and pennants
proliferate CAMERA PANS with Hagen and we see that Emmich’s
“territory” stretches on an on indicating a frightful
predominance At the center of this domain is a huge tent by
far the largest in the camp

EXT EMMICH’S TENT - DAY

A dozen leading knights enjoy an afternoon orgy Lithe
Circassian women dance around drunken warriors who lie like
pretzels in various stages of fornication

Emmich wearing only a codpiece and a turban picks his way
through the celebrants leading a frightened thirteen year old
girl by the hand

BALDWIN OF CHARTRES

Godfreys former ally lounges between young captives of both
sexes

BALDWIN
Emmich my friendYou like them
small

Emmich squeezes his girl’s pubescent nipple through the
transparent gauze of her top She winces and both men laugh

EMMICH
Closer to bone the sweeter the
meat

Baldwin extends his goblet
BALDWIN

To the sweetmeats of
JerusalemAnd your kingly rule

Emmich is about to drink when he hears the rantings of the
Madman in the distance “Hagen Hagen of the Cross Hagen Hagen
of the Cross He lowers his cup and wades to the front of the
tent He looks outside clears his fuzzy vision and sees

POV EMMICH

Hagen being led toward him

EMMICH’S JOY

is spoiled by what seems like a bad dream The other debauched
knights peer out of the tent and whisper to each other

VOICES
Is it him Is that Hagen

Emmich pushes away his nymphet and hastily pulls on his breeches
as he steps outside

EXT EMMICH’S TENT - DAY

Emmich strides forward to meet Hagen His drinking buddies
follow half-dressed

Crusaders of all kinds gather to watch the impending reunion

Ivo reigns his horse and Hagen is jerked to a stop in front
of Emmich

Ivo
He killed Waldemar

Emmich’s face darkens as he see his cousin’s body slung over
a horse

Infuriated he spots a nearby knight holding a MACE AND CHAIN
Emmich snatches the weapon from its owner and wraps the chain
around his hand He turns to Hagen and swings the spiked iron
ball It makes a terrifying sound as it shreds the air

Ivo sidles up to Emmich and whispers in his ear

Ivo
We caught him with an Arab whore

EMMICH
astounded
He was with a woman

Ivo nods Emmich’s jaw clenches with doubled fury

EMMICH °
Then this will hurt

He advances on Hagen and slings the mace at his crotch

Hagen crumples to his knees
vay
val

Swinging the mace Emmich circles Hagen and addresses all
assembled

EMMICH
This man now dressed in Moslem
rags is a traitor to our faith
He must die

With a mighty pitch Emmich bashes Hagen in the ribs with the
mace Hagen lurches forward and balances himself on one end
of his log yoke

Emmich edges in front of Hagen whirling the mace with one hand
and touching his own disfigured face with the other Smiling
he aims a mutilating blow at Hagen’s head Hagen abruptly
twists and the mace wraps around the yoke near his neck chain
stretched taut

Hagen pivots jerking Emmich toward him Then he rotates his
shoulders braining Emmich with the other end of the yoke

The force of the attack flings Emmich and Hagen away from each
other onto their backs Both struggle to get to their feet
Ivo and the Potato-Faced Peasant kick Hagen onto his back and
stand on his yoke Emmich slowly approaches Hagen swinging
the mace intent on delivering a deathblow

The SOUND OF BELLS distracts him He turns and sees that a path
is being cleared through the surrounding crowd for Adhemar

The old bishop walks falteringly weakened by the long campaign
Godfrey and his knights follow

EMMICH
God’s ballsHere come the
skirts
ADHEMAR

pauses seeing Hagen His expression brightens

ADHEMAR
He is alive

Adhemar gazes around at the men that surround Hagen

ADHEMAR
Why is he bound Untie him at once

EMMICH
This man deserted our cause and
serves the enemies of Christ
Look he wears a Moslem amulet

Emmich points to the Hand of Fatima around Hagen’s neck Adhemar
is shocked

ADHEMAR
I would hear your defense Hagen
HAGEN
He sold me to the Moslems as a
slave I escaped and was captured
by his men

EMMICH
Lying scum -- I have condemned
this filthy serf to death

Godfrey grandstands to the knights

GODFREY
Emmich thinks he is already King
of Jerusalem

EMMICH
A crown reserved for Godfrey no
doubt

Godfrey turns to Adhemar

GODFREY
Bishop this dispute should be
settled by a duel of justice
Let God decide who tells the
truth

The knights around them echo Godfrey’s suggestion Hagen glares
at Emmich

HAGEN
yes let us fight

ADHEMAR
This can be settled after
Jerusalem is taken Until then
we must fight the enemy who would
wipe us all from the earth

Adhemar turns to Hagen still tied to the log

ADHEMAR
Hagen are you with us

HAGEN
Your grace not all Moslems seek
our death In Jerusalem I saw
Christians living in peace free
to worship at our shrines

EMMICH
You hear that He calls the Pope
a liar”

HAGEN

The leader of Jerusalem wants no
part of war He comes to offer
truce to pray within his walls
idl

A murmur passes through the Crusade

ADHEMAR
Can he be trusted this infidel

HAGEN
I know this He will not attack
us unless we attack first

THWACK An arrow narrowly misses Hagen and skewers Adhemar in
the chest

For an instant everyone is frozen Then they look at the
HILLTOP ABOVE THEM

Black-robed archers on horseback line the ridge bows loaded
and ready to shoot Djarvat sits on his black horse holding
the empty bow he just fired At his side Ibn Khaldun sits
grimly astride his horse

HAGEN

is stunned Ivo points to the opposite hilltop

Ivo
Look

OPPOSITE HILLTOPS

An Arab army surrounds them on all sides Cavalry Infantry
Phalanxes of archers

DJARVAT LOOKS EXPECTANTLY AT IBN KHALDUN

Ibn Khaldun gives the signal and the archers fire a round of
arrows into the sky

EXT CRUSADER CAMP
Thousands of arrows rain into the camp

GODFREY
To arms Were under attack

The Crusaders run for cover Brother Bernard and several
acolytes carry Adhemar away

DJARVAT

lifts his sword high over his head With the cry “’La Ilalhu
Illa Allah” he spurs his horse forward His soldiers take up
the cry and chargé behind him down the hillside

IBN KHALDUN

gives the signal and his legions of archers gallop down all
the hillsides of the valley encircling the Crusaders
i

EXT CRUSADER CAMP

The Crusaders rush for their armor and weapons except for
Emmich

EMMICH
This traitor led them to us

Emmich picks up a rock and steps toward Hagen preparing to bash
in his skull Still tied to a log Hagen is helpless to resist

Suddenly WHACK Codfrey slices through the rope that binds one
of Hagens wrists to the yoke WHACK He cuts through the other
rope and Hagen is free
Emmich glares at Godfrey
GODFREY

Kill him later if you want Now

we need him
Godfrey rushes off to arm himself Emmich and Hagen are left

facing each other with an Arab army bearing down on them at full
speed

Finally Emmich throws down his stone and storms off toward the
squire who holds his armor

All around Hagen footsoldiers arm themselves with pikes and
halberds Peasants grab shovels and pitchforks

Hagen takes what is available -- a SCYTHE
MOUNTED ARCHERS

gallop around the encircled Crusade firing arrow after arrow
in rapid succession

CRUSADERS

are struck in vast numbers The common soldiers and peasants
take positions behind wagons and makeshift barricades

HAGEN

is stuck in the middle of the Crusaders unable to fight an
enemy that whirls around him out of reach

ADHEMAR

grimaces as a surgeon cuts the arrow from his chest Around

“him monks leads peasants in SINGING A HYMN

IBN KHALDUN

signals his infantry which advances downhill toward the
Crusaders

The Emir remains on the hilltop in command of the cavalry Each

Moslem knight is equipped with a long sharp lance and a round
shield

GODFREY AND EMMICH

ride at the head of the disorganized knights as they trot
through the camp to the front carrying lances and kite-shaped
shields Trumpets blare in a hollow call to arms

THE MOSLEM INFANTRY

now engages the Frankish footsoldiers Injured and demoralized
by their heavy losses the Christians are no match for their
inspired Saracen counterparts

THE MADMAN

wanders through the battle ranting and raving All around him
soldiers perish but he is magically unscathed

MADMAN
Smite them Victory Army of Christ
Hagen is risen Hallelujah

HAGEN

battles Arab footsoldiers with the scythe Like the Grim
Reaper he mows them down at the ankles He whacks another with
the stem and spikes an attacker in the top of the head with the
point of the blade

THE CRUSADER KNIGHTS

reach the open field outside the raging battle Godfrey raises
his hand and the knights form themselves into a line He
clasps his hands in a moment of prayer and the knights around
him do the same

ON A HILLTOP

Ibn Khaldun signals his eager cavalry to wait for the Crusaders
to finish their prayer

FACING OFF

the Crusaders lift their lances The Moslem horsemen do the
same

At the trumpet’s call the knights lunge ahead with the call
God wills it”

Ibn Khaldun leads the Moslems downhill with the call “LA ILLAHU
ILA ALLAH”

THE BATTLE

The two mounted armies each shouting the battle cry of their
faith drive toward each other and collide at full gallop

Ibn Khaldun’s lance drives into the eye-slit of a knights
helmet and out the back

Emmich deflects the lance of a Moslem charger and swipes the
man with his sword disemboweling him

Godfrey slays his opponent but all around him Moslems decimate
the Crusader knights in a one-sided battle

Baldwin of Chartres is run through the chest

Moslem archers ride the flanks of battle picking targets They
shoot as they stand in their stirrups or from beneath the
bellies of their horses as they swing beneath

Godfrey shields himself against the rain of arrows but others
are hit Horses rear and fall

An arrow strikes Emmich’s arm He yanks it out

The instant the arrows stop Moslem riders charge from the
opposite side Before the Crusaders can turn their mounts they
are struck by Moslem swordsmen

DJARVAT AND HIS HORSEMEN

break through Crusader- lines and penetrate into the heart of
the camp Shouting “Allah Akbar they hack down peasants and
footsoldiers

ADHEMAR AND THE MONKS

sink to their knees and pray awaiting martyrdom Women
children and peasants have formed a ring of prayer around them

HAGEN

blocks the downward blow of an Arab scimitar with his scythe
handle and with a loud WHOOSH cuts off the Arab’s arm Hagen
drops the scythe and takes the scimitar from the detached hand

Now armed with a legitimate weapon Hagen wades through the sea
of battle Dodging the colliding haunches of horses he hacks
down an enemy footsoldier then puts on the chest armor from

a fallen Crusader knight Before the armor is secure a Moslem
swordsman attacks from the rear on foot but Hagen blindly
slices his throat with a dervish-like backward spin

Hagen grabs a round Moslem shield from the ground and with one
motion parries the attack of two moreMoslem swordsmen
Defeating them he exchanges his scimitar for a straight
Crusader broadsword which he takes from a dead knight

The sword and its hilt make a cross Hagen kisses the blade
fortified to have his accustomed weapon
FROM THE REAR OF THE BATTLE
Arab archers launch flaming arrows into the Crusader camp
THE CENTER OF THE CAMP
is suddenly illuminated by burning missiles Arrows arc over
a landscape of dead and dying striking tents and carts which
burst into flame It seems the fires of Armageddon have come
Adhemar turns to Brother Bernard
ADHEMAR

This is our punishment God has

forsaken us
OVERWHELMED AND OUTNUMBERED
the Crusader knights fall back
EMMICH
fighting savagely is knocked off his horse by a mighty blow
GODFREY
rides among the ranks of men exhorting them to fight

GODFREY

Turn back and fight Christ fights

with you
HAGEN
Three archers lined up in a row take aim at some Crusaders
Hagen charges them with his broadsword running them through
like a kabob He places his foot near the hilt of his sword
and draws out the fully-buried blade
He finds a dead Frankish knight and exchanges his Moslem shield
for a kite-shaped Crusader shield He puts on Crusader shoulder
armor and yanks the open-faced helmet from the dead Crusader’s
head
Hagen is starting to look like himself again

EMMICH

horseless wades among the ranks of men using his sword to
drive terrified soldiers back to battle

EMMICH
Fight until the arrows find you

Some drop to their knees and take up the hymn of martyrdom
Emmich prods them to their feet
EMMICH

Fight Or beg for death when they

pound stakes up your ass
HAGEN
looks around and sees a Moslem footsoldier trying to mount a
Crusader horse He slays the Arab and heaves himself into the
saddle He shoves the helmet over his head
Now Hagen is once more a complete knight
A LARGE CLOUD OF SMOKE

backlit by flames engulfs the camp Moslems flash by on their
horses like demonic shadows

THE CRUSADERS

are retreating en masse

HAGEN

wheels around on his horse and sees a Crusader on the ground
besieged on all sides Seizing a pike from a footsoldier he
gallops to save him

Using the hook he snatches a Moslem off the knight and hurls
him away He stabs another with the pike

The Crusader struggles to his feet Turning to face Hagen he
lifts his helmet and laughs It’s Emmich

Ivo rides up with a horse for Emmich and he mounts still
laughing at Hagen as he retreats before the Moslem onslaught

EVEN GODFREY

must retreat as Ibn Khaldun’s knights rout the Crusaders back
into their smoke-enshrouded camp

ONLY HAGEN

holds his ground Engulfed by the advancing Moslem cavalry
he fights like a berserker Then he disappears into the
spreading smoke

THE CRUSADER ARMY

degenerates into panic Soldiers turn tail and run Others
kneel around Adhemar praying as they await final martyrdom

DJARVAT AND HIS HORSEMEN

charge the circle of prayer slaying unarmed monks with great
relish

THE MADMAN

retreats with the army spouting nonsensical prophecy Looking
over his shoulder he sees something so astounding that he stops
running stops ranting -- and watches in awe

MADMAN’S POV

On the wall of smoke a remarkable vision appears

Projected onto the dark cloud by the backlight of the setting
sun is the huge mounted silhouette of a Crusader knight on
horseback -- a gigantic SHADOW WARRIOR The Shadow Warrior
fights off Moslems who attack him two and three at a time

THE MADMAN
siezes fleeing Crusaders and violently forces them turn around

MADMAN
Look Look

Monks and peasants cross themselves upon seeing the holy
apparition

MADMAN
Christ On the clouds of heaven
The Lord has come

A hysteria spreads through the crowd

VOICES
Jesus is here Christ has come to
deliver us

GODFREY EMMICH ADHEMAR

stare at the giant silhouette struggling to comprehend its
meaning

THEIR POV THE APPARITION

A Moslem Horseman charges out of the cloud of smoke directly
at CAMERA like the angel of death sword held high shouting
in Arabic -- the epitome of jihad

The Shadow Warrior turns toward the terrifying Saracen and
throws his sword like a javelin

The sword flies out of the dense smoke and strikes the Moslem
through the back like a thunderbolt When the Moslem keels
forward the sword arcs straight up like a triumphant cross
surrounded by a mystical aureole of sunlight

EMMICH AND GODFREY

gasp in wonder

GODFREY
God is with us Turn and fight
EMMICH
Fight’ you cowards God wills

victory

Knights pick up the cry “God wills it” Like a wave the
resolve to fight spreads through the entire army

THE SHADOW WARRIOR

vides out of the cloud and the smoke around him disperses The
Madman is the first to recognize him It is Hagen

MADMAN
Hagen Hagen is Lord Maranatha

HAGEN

retrieves his sword from the Saracen’s back When he looks up
he sees that half the Crusade is staring at him in awe Hagen
pauses for a breath then raises his sword high

HAGEN
Fight for your lives Follow me

Hagen turns his horse and leads the Crusaders in a charge

IBN KHALDUN

is astounded to see the Crusaders riding toward him At the
threshold of victory the Moslems hesitate And in that moment
the tide of battle shifts

Trumpets blare rallying the Christians

HAGEN GODFREY EMMICH

Inspired by faith the Crusaders battle fearlessly savagely
pressing forward

DJARVAT AND HIS MEN

are attacked in the middle of the camp by peasants and
footsoldiers wild with the scent of blood

With their pikes and and clubs and shovels the lowest of the
Crusaders overwhelm the blackrobed horsemen pulling several
to the ground and mashing them to a pulp

The peasants converge on Djarvat and try to drag him out of the
saddle He hacks at them but the Crusaders keep coming

Djarvat panics
DJARVAT
Retreat Retreat These Christians
are possessed

Djarvat wheels his horse and trampels those who hamper his
retreat

He and his black-robes gallop through the camp pursued by the
fanatical Crusaders

IBN KHALDUN

watches in disbelief as Djarvat and his men flee the field of
battle

Many of his beleaguered knights seeing this betrayal abandon
their orderly retreat and flee for their lives

A BODY OF CRUSADERS

pursue the routed Moslems inflicting terrible losses

IBN KHALDUN

abandoned by half his army fights on with the stalwart remnant

Hagen sees Ibn Khaldun in the middle of the fray and drives his
horse towards him

Ibn Khaldun sees Hagen Their eyes meet and Hagen shouts

HAGEN
Leila escaped She is safe

IBN KHALDUN
No Djarvat has her still

Hagen is astounded Tbn Khaldun nods with shared regret

Ibn Khaldun looks around and sees there is no hope He turns
to Hagen a face he cantrust He shouts to his color guard

IBN KHALDUN
Strike colors Strike colors

The banners are thrown down Hagen yells at the Crusaders
around him 7

HAGEN
Give them quarter They surrender

Some of the men back off Godfrey echoes the shout
GODFREY

They’ve struck their colors Give

them quarter
Suddenly there is a blood-curdling shriek
Emmich Ivo and a party of his men ride on the Moslem command
who have now lowered their swords Ibn Khaldun manages a last
look toward Hagen as he is cut down by Emmich
Hagen rides into the fray and restrains two Crusaders but he
is powerless to stop the bloodbath He turns away from what
quickly becomes a slaughter
PEASANTS AND FOOTSOLDIERS

flood forward with their tools and weapons to beat the life from
the remaining Moslems as they desperately scramble for escape

Crusader women and children join the fray chasing a crawling
Moslem hacking at him with sickles and hoes

Hagen reacts with disgust while knights laugh and shout
encouragement

DJARVAT

turns and looks at the pitiful remnants of a mighty Arab army
Bitter and ashamed he rides for the hills with the survivors

AROUND HAGEN

the cry “Jerusalem God wills it” begins and becomes a chorus
But Hagen is silent

EXT A STREAM BANK DUSK

Alone Hagen washes his face beside a stream In the distance
the cries and chants of the Crusaders can still be heard

Sitting back he removes the “Hand of Fatima” which Leila gave
him Holding it in his palm he thinks of Leila

In a sudden’ rage Hagen tears at-his white tunic decorated with
the crimson cross symbol of the Crusade He rips the garment
in two and throws it’on the ground

Then behind him he hears a SOUND Hagen’s hand goes to his
weapon Rising he peers into the surrounding forest and sees --
lll

A WHITE HORSE

staring at him from the foliage The animal nickers and steps
out It wears a bridle saddle and blood-stained trappings
emblazoned with crimson CROSSES

HAGEN SMILES

recognizing his old mare that was lost when he sailed from Bari

HAGEN
It’s you

The white horse nods and steps forward Hagen steps to it and
strokes its head

HAGEN
What a smart girl you are How
did you find me

The mare nuzzles him Hagen glances again at the Hand of Fatima
which he still holds

HAGEN
If you can find me I can find
her
EXT THE CRUSADER CAMP - NIGHT
Hagen returns to the camp leading the white horse from which
he has removed all the trappings There is a celebratory mood
around him Crusaders drink and carouse in victory The
harlot’s cart is doing a land office business
The Madman sees Hagen and proclaims his arrival
MADMAN
The Saviour Hagen of the Cross
Deliver us from evil
Crusaders of all types turn toward Hagen cross themselves

touch him reverently Many fall in behind Hagen following him
as he walks

Hagen ignores them all wanting no part of this Crusade
BROTHER BERNARD
emerges from the shadows ahead and calls to him

BROTHER BERNARD
Hagen

Brother Bernard approches him
BROTHER BERNARD
Bishop Adhemar sent me to find
you His wound is quite grave
There isn’t much time

Hagen nods wearily and follows the monk His unwelcome
entourage trails behind

INT ADHEMARS TENT - NIGHT
Hagen still wearing body armor steps into a large tent

Monks kneel in prayer around Adhemars bed A triangular death
mask of black velvet embroidered with a silver skull is beside

the pillow Brother Bernard whispers to the old man that Hagen
has come

Adhemar breathing in short gasps looks up at him

ADHEMAR
Hagen

Hagen says nothing He waits uneasily as Adhemar whispers to
Brother Bernard who motions the others to leave Adhemar
gestures Hagen to sit beside him

ADHEMAR
Sit by me

Hagen sits Adhemar reaches out and touches his arm

ADHEMAR
I am dying Help me to die in
peace

Hagen looks at the old man at a loss for words

HAGEN
What can I do

ADHEMAR
I fear deeply that I have failed
God I am tormented by the
horrorsby the suffering that
i have allowed in his name

Hagen sees the mortal terror in Adhemar’s eyes
ADHEMAR
You are chosen by God It must
be you who takes the Cross

HAGEN
The cross

ADHEMAR
The True Cross in the Holy
Sepulchre Take it and rule
You alone are blessed

Hagen agonizes over what he can say Finally

HAGEN
No Bishop I am not blessed

Adhemar shakes his head in a denial of Hagen’s words He grips
Hagen’s arm with a sudden rush of strength ‘

ADHEMAR
You bear his sign Follow God’s
will

HAGEN

I know nothing of God’s will
Hagen speaks without looking at Adhemar

HAGEN
The cross on my back is a brand
that I burned on myself to escape
hanging My dream was alla
1

Hagen turns to Adhemar

HAGEN
I Geceived you

Adhemar lies with his eyes open He is dead but his expression
implies he is at peace

HAGEN RISES

from the bed and backs away A monk moves past him from the
door kneels and begins praying Another crosses to Adhemar
closes his eyes and places the death mask over his face As
Hagen moves away the tent gradually fills with clergy intoning
prayers for Adhemar

him his large contingent of loyal knights follow in penitent
procession
EMMICH RIDES ON HORSEBACK
at the head of his large camp of conquerors
HAGEN IS NEXT ASTRIDE HIS WHITE HORSE

But following him the Madman whips himself with a scourge a
few steps ahead of a legion of followers -- hundreds of
footsoldiers peasants and humble knights all fanatically
devoted to the miraculous Hagen of the Cross

The sight of the walled city excites them to a frenzy Many
throw away their shoes and stumble ahead their bare feet torn
and bloody from the rocks Some crawl on their knees in
penitence

Hagen stares at the city trying to peer through the walls
Trying to see Leila

Emmich drops back and waits for Hagen Hagen ignores him but
Emmich walks alongside

EMMICH
Hagen I’m in your debt You
saved my life

HAGEN
That was a mistake

EMMICH
No brother Even enemies can
be useful toeach other

Hagen glances suspiciously at Emmich who nods toward Godfrey

EMMICH
What do you gain if Godfrey
becomes king A handful of coins

HAGEN
Whatever I can take

EMMICH
If I wear the crown you’ll have
my lands in France Our father’s
estate will be yours

Hagen’s eyes betray a flash of interest

HAGEN
Youre a liar

EMMICH
What need will Ihave for a
hillside of grapes when Im
sitting on Herods throne We’ll
never see each other again

Hagen walks on a few steps

HAGEN
What do you want

EMMICH
Only your love -- And the loyalty
of those who follow you

Emmich glances back at Hagen‘s large army of supporters Hagen
thinks for a moment then turns amicably to Emmich

HAGEN
Brother before I see you King
of Jerusalem

Hagen smiles at him a beat then marches forward

Emmich stops in place seething as Hagen’s army streams around
him

HAGEN

apart from other workers swings an axe cutting logs into
usable shapes as part of the huge construction effort As he
works a LONE MONK whose face is hidden under a raised cowl
walks nearby spouting verse to encourage the workers

LONE MONK
Heed the Revelations Wherein it
tells of Jerusalems fall
“Forward Pilgrims death to all
who have offended Christ

Hagen doesnt look up or pay attention as the Monk approaches
delivering his final words almost directly into Hagen’s face

“Leave not woman nor child

the day of redemption” Have you
the stomach for it Knight

bones are strewn throughout

HAGEN
What is this place

are inched to the walls A carpet of dead lays strewn behind
showing the path they took

Soldiers crank the launcher of a mangonel Emmich supervises

Hagen and Ari scramble from the cistern into the ruins of the
Temple inside the walls of Jerusalem Near the Temple Gate

front charges scimitar raised Hagen gashes his side with a
swing of his broadsword

Djarvat tries to turn his horse but Ari lunges and grabs the
reins In the struggle for control Djarvat’s horse shies
twists and falls onto its side

As the third black-robe calms his steed Ari cuts Leila from
her horse

Djarvat springs to his feet scimitar in hand Hagen rushes
toward him brandishing his larger broadsword

Djarvat snatches the dead guard’s scimitar from the ground and
mow faces Hagen with a weapon in both hands

A whirlwind of blades Djarvat charges Hagen forcing him back
Against such speed Hagen cannot strike out with his bulky
weapon but only use its side to defend himself He blocks a
torrent of deadly blows but Djarvat’s blades strike closer and
closer to flesh

MISSILES FROM THE CRUSADER MANGONELS

and Djarvat are bombarded by rubble and knocked to the ground

barrage of arrows sticks in the doorway above their heads

Hagen shelters Leila as they are forced back toward the shelter

buildings

Hagen looks toward the burning church A bucket brigade of
monks is trying to put out the flames

HAGEN’S GAZE

from inside and Hagen reacts as---

AN OLD MONK THEODOSIUS

appears through the smoke His eyes desperately search the
crowd the young the old the feeble But his penetrating gaze
finds Hagen He points at him and calls out

THEODOSIUS
YouCome

HAGEN
amazed starts toward the monk
THEODOSIUS
You have strength Help us save

the cross

Hagen stricken by the old man’s words glances at Leila then
steps to the doorway

The old monk stares at him through the swirling smoke His
words are indistinct in the roar of the flame

THEODOSIUS
I am Theodosius God has sent
you
He turns into the smoke-filled entrance and Hagen follows

flames
POV HAGEN
A silver cross stands before the Mosaic of Abraham A beam
suddenly drops from the ceiling and fire rises obliterating
it from view Then magically it reappears
HAGEN PUSHES TO THE ALTAR

He steps through burning rubble Flames scorch the silver as
he reaches the cross

At the center of the silver cross is a piece of ancient
blackened wood the remains of the True Cross

Hagen grabs the cross member with his hands He winces His
hands are burned at its touch but he holds it and slowly lifts
it from the altar and settles it onto his back

At the touch of the hot metal his shirt burns away and he
groans with pain as he struggles with his burden

back the flames with buckets of water as Hagen carries the heavy
cross toward the door Theodosius walks ahead guiding him
through the smoke

HAGEN STEPS FROM THE SEPULCHRE

Staggering under the weight he descends the steps with
Theodosius and monks following

HIS HEAD LOWERED HAGEN

is unaware of Emmich As he walks he hears the clanking of
armor Looking up he sees---
THE KNIGHTS

ease themselves off their horses and drop to their knees at the
sight of Hagen

THE MADMAN

is completely awestruck

IN THE COURTYARD

Emmich remains mounted but many of his men so stricken by the
image of Hagen and the True Cross push forward a reach to touch
the relic

EMMICH
Pathetic fools Kill him

None respond to Emmich
HAGEN CALLS TO
Theodosius and the monks who now surround him
HAGEN
Take the Cross Hide it where no

crusader will ever find it

At Theodosius’ command a dozen monks lift the Cross from
Hagen’s back As they take it away Hagen draws his sword

EMMICH
Seize the Cross

Emmich looks down to see Ivo on his knees praying alongside
all the others The Madman cries out in ecstasy

MADMAN
Hagen is king King of Jerusalem
Hagen is king

In a mad fury Emmich draws his sword rides over Ivo and
pushes his sword through the Madman’s back

collapses onto the ground With blood dripping from his mouth
he casts a last worshipful look at his hero

MADMAN
Hagen

EMMICH
reins his horse around and faces Hagen

EMMICH

He charges Hagen who meets him in a two-handed stance Emmich’s
first swing misses He swings around for another

EMMICH TRIES

to trample Hagen Hagen is knocked down Emmichs horse rears
and stomps him but he manages to roll away and spring catlike
to his feet

Emmich charges and Hagen retreats toward the colonnade that
lines the courtyard Emmich swings but Hagen darts behind a
column

Emmich maneuvers around the column hacking at Hagen and forcing
him into the open As Emmich charges again Hagen jumps onto
the raised porch of the church and swings his sword with all

his strength The blade catches Emmich just below the ribs
severing his head sword arm and upper torso in one piece

Sword still in a hand a horrible battle cry bursting from his
lungs Emmich’s upper trunk falls to the dust of the courtyard

The horse squeals in panic and rears with Emmich’s lower body

in the saddle It turns and gallops out the courtyard gate into
the streets of Jerusalem with the ghostly half-Emmich still in
the saddle

HAGEN WATCHES

the horse disappear then he rams the blade of his sword into
the dirt and breaks off the blade

He crosses to Leila and takes her in his arms
EXT JERUSALEM - DAWN
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS

Fires still burn and a deathly veil of smoke hangs over the
city From somewhere in the streets a chorus of a thousand
voices sings an anthem of victory

The burned ruin of Al-Aqsa mosque looms in the foreground as
a huge procession passes the lifeless square

The Hermit Monk now in the robes of a bishop surrounded by
acolytes swinging censers of incense leads a solemn march of
the victors through what was once a living city They step over
bodies and limbs and slog through puddles of blood

The gold cross atop his-staff floats through swirls of smoke
against a background of fire and devastation

EXT A SIDE STREET - DAWN

Hagen on foot leads two horses packed for travel Leila
wearing a veil is mounted on one

They emerge onto a square near the burned ruins of the
synagogue The area is littered with Jewish dead A few pyres
of burning bodies are tended by black masked soldiers

HAGEN

gazes toward the ruins of the synagogue Something on the
ground catches his eye He reaches down and lifts a yarmulke
As his thoughts go to Ari the singing is suddenly louder and---

THE CRUSADER PROCESSION APPEARS

Godfrey rides at its head followed by Ivo and other prominent
knights united in victory

Hagen’s expression betrays disgust and the same can be read
in Leila’s eyes

GODFREY
sees Hagen He leaves the others and approaches him

GODFREY
Hagen come to the Holy Sepulchre
I am to be crowned king I
promise there will be a high place
for you in my realm

HAGEN
Youll wear a crown of gold where
Christ wore a crown of thorns

Godfrey hears the innuendo but chooses to ignore it
GODFREY

Join us in giving thanks to God
for the glory of this conquest

HAGEN
What glory
GODFREY
Our victory has restored Gods

kingdom
Hagen reacts to the outrageous irony of Godfrey’s words

- HAGEN
God’s kingdom

Hagen looks around at the piles of dead and the burning ruins
that surround the plaza
HAGEN
Take a look around Take a deep
breath and with the stench of
death in your nose go tell God
youve restored his kingdom

Hagen turns and leads the horses away from the procession

Godfrey fighting whatever wells from his own conscience backs
away and begins singing the Latin words of the anthem

EXT THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM NEAR DAVID’S GATE - MORNING

As Hagen and Leila approach the open gate that leads from the
city a RAGGED PEDDLER emerges from the shadows of a building
and approaches them

PEDDLER
ChristianChristian wait

Hagen ignores the Peddler and keeps moving but the man pursues

PEDDLER
When you leave this holy city
would you not want to carry a
piece of the True Cross Surely
you of all knights have earned
it for your valor

Hagen turns at the familiar ring of the man’s words
A DIRTY FACE
smiles up at him Hagen beams It’s Ari

HAGEN
Ari

Hagen hugs him and looks him over Ari is pretty badly bruised
and burned

ARI
I found a way out for my uncle
and ten others

Ari shrugs as Hagen shakes his head smiling

ARI
And you No crown No treasure

HAGEN
Well live as I was born to live
from the land

ARI
Sad you had such promise as a
thief

He takes Leila’s hands
ARI
And these soft hands Princess
tilling the soil

LEILA
They will harden as we raise
crops And children

HAGEN

Come with us

ARI
No I have my trade And with
so many pilgrims it’s good
Already I’ve sold three hairs from
the beard of John the Baptist

Hagen smiles

ARI
When you return with the bounty
of your harvest come find me
Ill either be at the mosque the
temple or the sepulchre
wherever the faithful are
gathered

Another embrace and Hagen and Leila leave
EXT DAVID’S GATE - OUTSIDE THE WALLS - MORNING

Hagen leads the horses out of the city In the background the
deserted siege towers can be seen along with a few scavengers
picking through the dead

HAGEN GLANCES AROUND

and they start on the road away from the city Hagen takes
Leila’s hand and looks up at her He smiles kisses her hand
then climbs onto his horse They canter away and as the CAMERA
PANS up to the walls of Jerusalem the sound of CHURCH BELLS
echoing from within the city is gradually drowned by the sound
of WIND

The mountains are cloaked in swirling mist as Hagen and Leila
ride from the mountain pass into a valley Ahead in fields
carpeted with spring flowers the small farm can be seen where
they first knew love
