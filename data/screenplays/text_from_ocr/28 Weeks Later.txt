INT COTTAGEKITCHEN 1

A beat ater there is a FLARE of phosphorus as a natch
strikes and lights the wck of a CANDLE

In the candl e-li ght now reveal

ALICE dark hair sweet expression has DIFFERENTLY
COLOURED EYES

She stands in the kitchen of a country cottage

The shutters are closed over the wndow It appears to be
late at night

Besi de ALICE is DON wth a beard and long hair
lighting nore candles around the room and finally lights the
wood stove - on which ALICE is about to cook

DON and ALICE husband and Wfe are preparing dinner

DON
What are you going to cook

ALI CE

ALICE takes a PENKNIFE fromDONS belt and opens a can of
tomatoes wth it

ALICE
This is the ast one

DON
Dam I knewI should have got
more You can never have enough
cans of tomatoes

He opens a cupboard
Instead weve got five tins of
chi ck-peas What’s that good for

ALICE doesn’t reply DON glances at her
She is staring at the tomato sauce cooking on the stove
Abruptl y she starts crying

DON
(novi ng to confiort her)

Hey

(through her tears she
smiles)

I mean - it’s not okay It’s all

SALLY

SALLY

INTCOTTAGEDI NING ROOM 2
DON and ALICE enter dining roomwth SALLY

Like the kitchen the roomis candle-lit the shutters are
drawn and it feels as if it is late at night

ALICE carries a large bow of pasta wth a tomato sauce DON
carries a bottle of red wine

Sat around the table are four other people KAREN a wonan in
her earl y twenties JACOB a black guy In his thirties
GEOFF SALLY’ S husband

There are three enpty places at the table

SALLY
Qh - that smells wonderful

GEOFF

And is that a bottle of wane Don

DON

It is Geof I thought vwe’d treat

GEOFF
Absol utel y

DON pours a little into GEQFF’S glass - who takes a sip

GEOFF
Ah I’ mgetting blackberries
vanilla notes of autumn

As this is going on ALICE is putting pasta on bows and
handi ng them round

As she does so her eyes flick to KAREN - who is gazing
di rectl y ahead Wth a slightly glazed expression

And when ALICE gives the bow to KAREN she rather
deli beratel y puts it on the enpty space beside her

All notice this
In response to their gaze

KAREN
He’l1 be hungry
Beat

KAREN
He’ ll be hungry When he gets
back hell want sonething to eat

And fromher tone and odd intensities it is clear that
KAREN is danaged - slightly psychotic

JACOB

Here we go again

SALLY
Jacob no -

JACOB

(i gnoring Sally)
Let me tell you sonethi ng
sweetheart It’s been five days

J ACOB

sooner she faces it the better
There are no survivors It’s just

AT THAT MOMENT there is a LOUD BANGING on the FRONT DO
All heads snap in the direction of the noise - and freeze

A beat ater the BANGING cones again

DON’ S gaze snaps to GEOFF - who is besi de KAREN

BOY’S VOICE (OS)

He noves for the door and starts sliding back bolts W
not ce many of the bolts are new screwed into the heavy old
oak

BOY’S VOICE (OS)

(nuf f 1 ed)
Quickly Pl ease
DON

I’mconing I’ mconing
He pulls back the last bolt then turns a key in a fi ve-l ever
lock and PULLS THE DOOR OPEN -

- to reveal BRIGHT SUNSHINE on a beautiful green andscape
For the first tine we realise that this entire scene has
been taking place in the middle of the day rather than late
at night

The group of survivors squint against the brightness and
see silhouetted in the glare a thirteen year-old BOY

The BOY runs inside into the arns of ALICE

DON sl ans the door shut again quickly janming the bolts back
into place

As the door shuts the suck of air blows out one of the
candles on the table

CUT TO -

full y understand the virus yet

MELITARY OFFICER

GENERAL STONE - who has been i steni ng i mpassi vel y throughout

GENERAL STONE
Major I appreciate your posi ti on
But the civilian targets are not a
mlitary decision They are
political pure and sinple

SCARLET takes a breath

SCARLET
Then sir - maybe we should take the
issue out of a political arena

A beat

GENERAL STONE
Major - let ne be clear about this
If I have reason to believe that
your misgivings are eaked or in
any way conmuni cated to the press
you should not expect a discharge
You shoul d expect to be court-
martialed You should expect to be
f ucked

It spreads like panic ina football crowd a threshing bl ood-
flecked outverd ri pple

It also spreads as a VAVE OF DARKNSS People have been
using cigarette lighters and nobile phones to provide i ght
in the dark carpark and these are extinguished or snashed as
the infection spreads

The noise is deafening screans neshing Wth the hows of the
infected People scranble and tranple over each other as
they try to get avey

In this chaos ANDY is lifted into the air by the VWOWAN -

- before she is sucked down by a surge in the crowd

As she falls away ANDY manages to catch and pull hinself up
to the AIR VENTILATION DUCTING that runs across the ceiling

As he climbs along the ducting below himis a sea of
I NFECTED

A MAN sees ANDY and cli nts on top of people to try and reach
the position of safety -

- but his wei ght is too much and a section of the DUCTING
crashes back to the ground

This nearly takes ANDY wth it -

- and also creates his means of escape a hole in the
DUCTING which allows himto craw inside

leaving the Hellish scene behind him

EXT MED CENTRE - NIGHT 91

Inside the truck NOW
151 INT ABANDONED TRUCK - DAYGAS 151

DOYLE and SCARLET bundle ANDY and TAMW into the TRUCK’ S back
seats and they scramble into the front

- as the GAS rolls over the car

Note SCARLET is in the DRIVER SEAT DOYLE in the passenger
and ANDY and TAMW are in the back

DOYLE
(w nding up his wndow
desperatel y)
The vents The vents

SMOKE is coming through the AIR-CON VENTS

They snap shut the grill and start using anything to hand to
seal gaps in the vehicle - a crisp packet fromthe floor of
the cabin rags tissues

SIMULTANEOUS WITH THIS

TAM screans

Qn her side of the CAR ooning out of the snoke -

- is a BIO SODIER wth FLAME THROVER

SIMULTANEOUS WITH THIS

SCARLET has found keys in the ignition and is desperatel y
trying to start the engine

A nonent ater a JET OF FLAME is surrounding the TRUCK as
the FLAMETHROVER fi res

DOYLE shoots -

- through the glass of the passenger door killing the BIO
SOLDIER -

Wii ch neans GAS starts pouring in through the SMASHED WNDOW
AT THAT MOVENT -

- the engine turns over and SCARLET jans her Foot down on
the accelerator and the TRUCK LURCHES FORVARDS

It drives straight up over the pavenent catching a building
wth the front left corner

SCARLET struggles wth the wheel veering past obstacles that
LOOM out of the GAS CLOUDS

For a nonent the patches of fire on the bonnet and side
mrrors are the only indication of forward novenent through
the dense gas cl oud

Then abruptly they HIT a BIO SOLDIER who bounces up the
bonnet sl ans into the wndscreen then vani shes

Then -

EXT TRUCK - DAY 152
- the TRUCK shoots OUT of the GAS CLOUDS into clear air

GAS pours fromthe smashed w ndow as the air inside the cabin
starts to clear

INT TRUCK - DAY 153
But the CS TEAR GAS has blinded SCARLET -

- and as she wpes at her eyes wth one hand turning the
wheel wth the other -

- she fails to see the entrance of an UNDERGROUND STATION
straight ahead

DOYLE
LOOK OUT BRAKE BRAKE

An OPEN BRIEFCASE on the fl oor

A PHOTO BOOTH MACHINE wth an uncl ai med photo in the tray
curled wth age colour fading - but we can see two teenage
girls heads pressed together smiling

A baby’s PRAM

A TICKET MACHINE that has spewed coins and tickets like a
small snowdrift on the floor

DOYLE starts down the stairs treading over the bodies

DOYLE
ANDY TAMM

TAMW’S reply echoes along the tiled walls

TAM
(crying out)
Doyle Where are you

161 INT UNDERGROUND STATIONPLATFORM ENTRANCE - DAY 161

DOYLE reaches the bottomof the stairs - which ends at a T-
junction between the two north and south-bound pl atforns

Sat on the platformis the abandoned train fromwhich the
dead passengers nust have f ed

He is thi gh-deep in the tangle of bones

DOYLE
ANDY

He swongs the scope around frantically searching for the boy
and the girl

And then finds -
- TAMW through the arch to the southbound pl atform

She’s crawing on her hands and knees through the skulls and
ragged cl othes

He noves towerds her

DOYLE
Tammy I’mright here

Her head turns to the direction of his voice -

- as he reaches for her hand pulling her up to her feet and
AS SHE STANDS -

- a FIGURE is revealed DIRECTLY BEHI ND TAMW

CUT TO BLACK

162 INT UNDERGROUND STATIONPLATFORM - DAY 162
FROM A BLACK SCREEN -

- ANDY appears stunbling alone dow a platform

towards a light source An open grate in the street
overhead which creates a POOL O LIGH on the platform

ANDY
Tanmy Where are you

Fromsonewhere distant he hears his sister’s voice
screaming

ANDY
TAM

As ANDY reaches the pool of Iight he hears a noise from
behi nd - someone running

He turns
And appearing into the light we see - it’s DON
Covered in FRESH BLOOD

DON junps for the boy ANDY is knocked down to the floor
and DON is on hi mat once

DON crouches over ANDY -

- then bites dow into his son’s shoul der
ANDY screans out in pain

ANDY’ S bl ood spl ashes into his father’s mouth
Then

TAMW
DAD

DON freezes at the sound of his daughter’s voice
Then his head rises -

- and snaps around -

- to see TAMW standing behind him hol ding DOYLE’S sni per
weapon

She hol ds the ong-barreled rifle inexpertly It is held to
the side of her chest rather than jammed to her shoul der

But she is at point-blank range and the barrel is pointed
straight at DONS head

A frozen nonent between the father and daughter - their gaze
is locked

And for a nonent it seens oddly unclear what DON wl do
Alnost as if through his infection and nadness he can see
her And recognise her

Then he MOWES

Rising about to attack

And TAMW fires

DON is shot clean through the forehead

And he drops dead

FADE FROM THIS TO -

INT UNDERGROUND STATIONPLATFORM - DAY 163

ANDY i es on the floor bleeding fromthe neck
TAMW kneels beside him holding his hand

TAMW looks into her brother’s eyes -

- as a red cloud of infection bl ossons in the whites

ANDY
Tam -

TAMW
No

She repeats their promise fromthe Geek Tenple in the park

TAM
(qui et )
Vé stay together Whatever
happens

But ANDY isn’t about to let his sister die - if he becones
i nf ected

He junps up twsting free of her grip and RUNS

Her voice is growng fainter

INT UNDERGROUND STATIONPLATFORM - DAY 165
ANDY reaches the next pl atformon the line
As he climbs up on to the pl atform-

- his face is covered in beads of sweat and a feverish
trembling takes hold of his body

Hs field of vision becones blurred as the infection starts
to TAKE HOLD

Through this blurred vision ANDY becones awere of i ghts
coming frominsi de the tunnel

And a noment ater ANDY is AMAZED to see a train bursting
into the station at full speed

It slows to a halt

As it slows ANDY sees that the inside of the trainis full
of people Normal conmuters as one would have expected to
see on a nornal day of a normal week before the outbreak of
the vi rus

INT TRAIN CARRIAGE - DAY 166

ANDY enters

The doors slide shut and the train noves on

As the TRAIN starts to nove ANDY ooks up the ength of the
carriage and sees -

- standing on the other side of the gl ass-door partition to
the next carriage

ALICE his nother
Looking back at him

Her carriage is enpty and she seens healthy and clear of
i nf ecti on

Anazed ANDY starts to walk towards her

She smiles to see him

He smiles back

The TRAIN is picking up speed rolling in the corners

The legs and bags of the conmuters nake it difficult to make
progress

ANDY tries to hurry faster to the DOOR betveen the two
Carri ages

But as he does so -

- the lights suddenl y FLASH off and on

And between the pulses of i ght and dark he glimpses his
face in the reflection of the carriage wndows And his
reflection is alternating between the face of and INFECTED
and a NORMAL face

Just as he is about to get a hand to the doorwey -

- the lights flick OFF again replaced by a flickering glow
And in this glow ve see a hand reach out to GABHM

It’s the hand of one of the commuters - and the conmuters are
now all INFECTED

They are grabbing at him trying to keep himfromenteri ng
his mother’s carri age

ANDY starts to fight viciously And nowin the flickering
light we see that ANDY’S face is also the face of an
INFECTED

ANDY uses his fists and teeth Biting and tearing at his
attackers

And forces hinself out of their grasp -

- through the door -

INT TRAIN CARRIAGE - DAY 167

- and into the clean bright light of ALICE’S train carriage
His mother opens her arns
and they entrace

As they entrace we nove around ALICE until we find ANDY’S
eyes again
