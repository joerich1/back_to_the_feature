This is a true story
FADE IN
A GREAT MAZE

looms below us a labyrinth of tangled alleyways We DESCEND
toward it and into the dark heart of an ancient city

INT CAMPO DEI FIORE ROME -- NIGHT

The streets of Rome are locked in a 3AM traffic jam MUSIC
spills from cafes and discotheques We DESCEND further

TITLE UP 1973

into sidewalks overflowing with prostitutes B-movie stars
mafiosi down-on-their-luck royalty and paparazzi darting
between cars on Vespa scooters And now from out of the
crowd something even stranger emerges

A BOY

in his mid-teens at once streetwise and innocent A skinny
kid in worn jeans with iron-on patches on the knees The
streetwalkers in their platform shoes call out to him

PROSTITUTES
Ciao Paolo

The kid smiles bashfully as they fall in around him

PROSTITUTES (CONTD)
Che magro che vergogna So skinny
Paolo bambino why dont you let us
make you breakfast Wed look after
you real nice

PAUL
(smiles blushing)
I bet you would

A car pulls up to the curb its time for the girls to go
back to work Maria-Donna pulls Paul close serious now

MARIA-DONNA
Hurry home Paolo eh The street
is no place for a boy like you
Dont make your poor mamma worry

PAUL
I can take care of myself Ciao
Maria-Donna

Paul walks on leaving the girls to haggle with their johns

He pulls out a folded-over issue of Fantastic Comics and
walks away into the darkened narrow Via dei Bauillari
A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS

flicker to life behind him Paul walks on oblivious
immersed in his comic book

The car creeps forward The headlights like owls-eyes A
white Fiat 600 It drives up behind him Hovering

A man climbs out He wears a red ski mask

SKI MASK
Paul
PAUL
Yeah --
Paul turns and sees them A moment -- and then he runs

In an instant they are upon him The boy flails kicking
and writhing to buck them off Hes got a lot of fight in
him for such a skinny kid its as if he knew this was coming

They open the trunk and shove Paul inside He doesnt fit
Someone sits down on the trunk

The latch clicks its closed The men pull off their masks
Their eyes are black and wild with adrenaline They climb
into the car

SKI MASK
Avanti Go

CUT TO
A PHONE RECEIVER
clatters into its cradle We TILT UP to reveal a flustered
young SECRETARY in red lipstick and a tight sweater She
rises from her desk overwhelmed and she begins to run

EXT SUTTON PLACE (SURREY ENGLAND) -- DAY

A sprawling 400-year-old mansioned estate surrounded by
gardens and statuary

The secretary runs across the grounds in her high heels
She runs past a row of ancient busts of Roman emperors

She runs past a full-grown male LION pacing in a gilded cage
She runs past a swimming pool ringed by lounging STARLETS

She trips and stumbles as she breaks a heel She reaches
down pulls her shoes off and runs in her nylons --
INT SUTTON PLACE -- DAY

-- up the stairs of the mansion past walls cluttered with a
vast art collection She runs down the hallway --

INT ATELIER -- DAY

-- and opens the door to a huge room empty but for a Louis
XIV desk a phone and an old-time paper-tape stock ticker

A man in a bespoke suit stands at the window gazing out

upon his estate The paper tape from the stock ticker snakes
across the room and through his fingertips He whispers
price quotes to himself like a monk saying the rosary

SECRETARY
Im sorry Mr Getty I should have
knocked but -- its --

J PAUL GETTY turns and cocks an eyebrow His gaze is quick
and focused he has the impatience of a man whose mind is
always sixty seconds ahead of whomever hes listening to

GETTY
To the point Nancy the markets
open

SECRETARY
Theyve -- Hes been kidnapped

Paul Little Paul your grandson in
Rome my God hes just a child --

The ticker-tape in Gettys hands stops moving

OVER THEM until we find a singular figure standing amidst
the shifting sands J Paul Getty

PAUL (VO)
My grandpa was the one who brought
the oil out of the Saudi desert
Everybody knew it was there they
just thought it couldnt be done

We CRANE over the dunes to REVEAL a great city of refineries
and pumping oil derricks belching flame a mirage seemingly
summoned forth by Gettys will alone

But Grandpa found a way He made a
deal with the Bedouin tribes But
there was so much oil there was no
ship big enough to carry it all

STATIONS materialize out of nowhere dotting the landscape
all bearing the Getty name

name on them Grandpa controlled
every drop of oil from beneath the
earth to the customers gas tank

They turn to see Getty emerge from the bedroom freshly
groomed and powdered

GAIL
Im sorry

GETTY
Dirty and old I have no problem with
at all In fact I have some affection
for them as theyre the words most
frequently used to describe me along
with rich

Getty goes to the mirror inserts a tie bar into his collar

GETTY (CONTD)
But priceless -- thats another thing
entirely People say priceless when
what they really mean to say that
something is invaluable or
irreplaceable That Minotaur
statuette in your hands for instance
dates from 460BC there are only a
handful like it remaining and none
in such pristine condition Im
sure those fuckers at the Met or the
British Museum would kill to get
their greasy paws on it
LITTLE PAUL
He just said --

GAIL
Paul

GETTY
Would you care to guess what I paid
for it

GAIL

I wouldnt know where to begin

GETTY
Oh youre too modest Youve got
taste I can tell I think you know
a good deal about art

GAIL
I do I just dont know what it costs

GETTY
Well then youll learn Come on
indulge an old fool What do you
think I paid

GAIL
Five hundred thousand dollars

GETTY

Eleven dollars and twenty-three cents
I picked it up in the black market
in Heraklion This cripple was asking
seventeen dollars for it and it took
me an hour to bring him down to his
bottom line At Sothebys today Id
hazard itd bring 12 million

(a beat)
You see priceless is such an insipid
word Everything has a price The
great struggle in life is coming to
grips with what that price is

GETTY (CONTD)
I want you to have it

JOHN PAUL JR
We couldnt

GETTY
Do you like it Paul

PAUL

GETTY

Little Paul takes the figurine its done Theyre forced
to accept it Gail and Big Paul smile awkwardly

away pushing the clothesline aside as he crosses the room

GETTY (CONTD)
Pardon the laundry I wash my
undershorts myself in the bathroom
sink

(MORE )

GETTY (CONTD)
I see no reason to pay ten dollars
to have room service launder them
when I can do it myself for a few
lira What kind of rube do they
take me for Which reminds me --

He takes out a small notebook and golf pencil and writes an
entry LAUNDRY SOAP -- 22 LIRA

GETTY (CONTD)

concubines And this is where I
took my baths

PAUL

GETTY
In the second century when I was
the Emperor Hadrian I knew it the
moment I first visited this place
I remembered every stone as clearly
as if Id just come back from a trip
to the store for a pack of smokes
I never felt at home anywhere on

GETTY
Oh I tried believe me I made
them an offer a very generous offer

hear the name Getty they all get
dollar signs in their eyes They
said it wasnt for sale

PAUL

GETTY

Exactly That old tactic Thats
what Im talking about Paul

To be a Getty is to have everyone
you know secretly want a piece of
you You are surrounded always by
smiling faces but you have no one

PAUL
You have us

GETTY

(deeply moved)
Thats true I have you now And
to think it was almost too late

request for money I receive I would
soon be as destitute as yourself

The boy seems slightly downcast

picks up a new letter and opens it

attorney the high-strung diminutive GIOVANNI IACOVONI

The decadence of the father a
depraved drug addict living ina
palace in Marrakech filled with hippie
parasites How she suffers with
worry for her son

an annulment

ATTORNEY
Of course we expect Ms Getty will
be seeking a generous financial
settlement as is typical in high-
profile divorce cases

At the other end sits J Paul Getty silent and aloof Beside
him his lead attorney OSWALD HINGE

HINGE
As pertains to custody there is the
matter of Ms Gettys fitness as a
mother

IACOVONT
The father is a drug addict who cannot
tie his own shoes You would leave
the boy alone in Morocco with a rich
degenerate

HINGE
The court will take a close interest
in her psychological profile We
are asking the judge to order a
complete evaluation by a panel of
psychiatrists

IACOVONT
Ms Harris suffers from a common
affliction among the intelligent
women which is to fall in love with
lo imbrogliare losers bums Aside
from this she is in perfect mental
health you know this as well as I
do You are simply stalling using
the boy as a bargaining chip

HINGE
We have all the time in the world

IACOVONT

We will see you before the judge

A deal

All eyes turn toward Gail

I feel for your situation Your Royal
Highness Truly I do

PRINCE AL-RASHID
Our agreement with Getty has brought
us nothing but problems The younger
generation has become weak and lazy
Our children care about nothing but
Lamborghinis and discotheques

CHACE
Perhaps then you would do well to
accept our competitors offer

PRINCE AL-RASHID
How so Mr Chace

CHACE
Maybe Standard Oil will find ways to
siphon all that money away with their
accounting tricks and bring your
wayward children closer to God

Fletcher Chace grins The princes dont

CHACE (CONTD)
Kidding aside your highness My
employer has made you rich

PRINCE AL-RASHID
Not as rich as him

If you renew your land-use agreement

rich Can Standard Oil say that

Ive noticed people have a way of
getting rich just standing next to
him People like you

We dont need the Americans anymore

I prefer to risk the other guys

GETTY
I like to risk the other guys money
too My point is we represent a
very small minority of mankind The
herd feeds off what we accomplish
These people who took my grandson --
what do you think I should have done

But I dont need a retired policeman
or a former secret agent or a plastic
toy soldier to solve the mystery of
what happened to my son because
there is no mystery I dont need a
man of danger to catch the criminals
I need one thing only and that is
seventeen million dollars

CHACE
Paying the ransom doesnt guarantee
you get your son back

GAIL
Not paying the ransom nearly
guarantees I dont

CHACE
Id say your sons chances are better
than that

GAIL
Why dont you explain the odds to
me Is it a coin toss Heads he
lives tails he dies I can see how
thats a gamble worth taking when
theres real money at stake --

CHACE
Let me rephrase that

GAIL
A billion dollars earns seventeen
million dollars a month sitting ina
bank vault He could buy a Matisse
every day and never spend it all

CHACE
I dont think this is about money
for Mr Getty

GAIL
Im sorry I didnt realize this
was your first day on the job

CHACE
Maam Ive had to bargain with a
lot of rich people Sheikhs sultans
emirs The one thing Ive realized
is that money is never just money
It always stands for something
Usually it stands for the one thing
theyve never had Until you know
what that thing is youre just beating
your head against the bricks

DEL ROVERE
Your son is a very lucky boy Signora

GAIL
Nothing about this feels lucky to
me

DEL ROVERE

Of course its a terrible thing
But if he had to be taken this is
the best place it could happen No
police department in the world has
solved more kidnappings

CHACE
How did you earn that distinction

Rovere leads them up the marble staircase

DEL ROVERE
A few years ago we had an outbreak
of kidnapping Wealthy people
ordinary Italians everyone This
was how the communist Rosso Brigate
financed their terrorist activities
Everyone paid the ransom no matter
what we told them to do

GAIL
What about the families that refused
to pay

DEL ROVERE

Even the poorest family will give up
everything to have their children
back So I devised a solution We
froze the bank accounts of the all
the families so they couldnt pay

CHACE
Is that legal

DEL ROVERE
If the police do it it must be legal
It took some time but they realized
the money wouldnt come Now it
seems theyve decided to take
foreigners instead

CHACE
Freezing J Paul Gettys money is not
going to be an option in this case

DEL ROVERE
Im sorry Ive forgotten which party
you said you were working for

CHACE
I represent Mr Gettys interests
Im his head of security

DEL ROVERE
And what are Mr Gettys interests

GAIL
Business sex and the collecting of
art In that order

Del Rovere laughs but Gails not joking

responsibility for his kidnapping

richest capitalist in the world --
this would be a dream for them
They will take you too Signora if
they can So I am placing you under

kitchen -- his name is CORVO -- approaches Gail

CORVO
One final question Signora About
your testimony earlier Why did you
think the kidnapping was a joke
(MORE )

CORVO (CONTD)
(off her look)
You said that when you first received
the phone call from Cinquanta you
thought it was a joke

GAIL
Thats what passed through my mind

CORVO
Its a strange reaction is it not
Someone tells the mother her son is
kidnapped and she thinks its funny

GAIL
I didnt think it was funny at all
It seemed unbelievable

CORVO
You didnt believe the man on the
phone

GAIL

Its a figure of speech The whole
situation was unbelievable It still
is

CORVO
Tragic yes But not unbelievable

CHACE
Its not tragic yet Maybe you ought
to work on keeping it that way

CORVO
A figure of speech as you say
Please let us know Signora if you
plan to leave Italy for any reason

Corvo bows slightly and heads for the door with his partner

GAIL
Why do you think he said that

CHACE
Do you want me to get rid of them

For the ransom

ISABELLE
We dont have that kind of money

GAIL
We could get some friends together
Here aboard your boat The money
would be paid back in full I cant
say when but --

ISABELLE
I mean when you think how fortunate
that boy has been The money hell

GAIL
All of us are fortunate

ISABELLE
Not like that Hes set for life

GAIL
He has to live that long first The
money shouldnt matter Hes just a
boy an ordinary boy

ISABELLE
Of course it matters Gail Youd
be asking us asking our friends to
give a fortune to a boy whos worth
more money than theyll ever have

GAIL
If I could think of another way I
wouldnt be asking

JULIAN
And lets be honest Paul was no angel

GAIL

a surprise either Privileged kids

EXT VIA PANSIPERNA ROME -- EVENING

Fletcher Chace walks with a newspaper folded beneath his
arm He passes a streetlight with an X marked in chalk

Parked twenty paces from the streetlight is a white plumbers
van Chace knocks on the rear door twice and waits

INT WHITE VAN -- EVENING
A bland-looking young fellow frisks Chace

BLAND FELLOW
Siediti perfavore

Chace obeys The van lurches into motion

INT SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

The bland fellow leads Chace out of the garage into a sparsely-
decorated home Chace is led to a chair in the dining room

A red ROSSO BRIGATE flag is draped over one wall

BLAND FELLOW
Perfavore

Chace obeys A lamp is switched on shining in his eyes
FRANCESCI a mustached young man in a corduroy sportcoat is

seated beside the lamp A gun is on the table beside him
There are others in the room Chace squints at them

CHACE
You dont look like communists
FRANCESCI
What do communists look like
CHACE
Workers Wasnt that the original
idea
FRANCESCI

Sorry to disappoint you

CHACE
You look like accountants

FRANCESCI
Lets talk about the money

CHACE
First you prove to me that you have
the boy and hes in good health
Then we negotiate the terms But
first the proof

FRANCESCI
First the money Then the boy
CHACE
It doesnt work that way You know
that Youre supposed to be pros

FRANCESCI
No conditions

CHACE
I dont think you have the kid

An intense young woman MARGHERITA speaks

MARGHERITA
Why are we negotiating with him We
should try him and put him to death

CHACE
For what

MARGHERITA
For crimes against the proletariat

CHACE
Now I know you dont have the kid
If you kill me Gettys just going
to send someone else like me Unless
he doesnt in which case where does
that leave you Think comrade

FRANCESCI
We had an agreement

CHACE
Who had an agreement

FRANCESCI
We did With Paul

Chaces smile fades

CHACE
Excuse me

FRANCESCI
Paul used to talk about having himself
kidnapped With his friends out on
the street A game no one gets
hurt A way to make a little money
from his grandfather two million
dollars perhaps Thats what we do

Chace rubs his eyes suddenly weary

CHACE
Did Paul know who you were

FRANCESCI
We made friends with him We told
him we could help But then he

disappeared
MARGHERITA

We believe he found someone else
CHACE

And now you want -- what A finders

fee A consolation prize

MARGHERITA
The people are owed

CHACE
The people or just the people in
this room And here I thought you
all were supposed to be above money

FRANCESCI
No one is above money The problem
is that its in the wrong hands We
intend to get what is our due

CHACE
(rising)
Ill save you a place in line

FRANCESCI
Im curious What would Getty pay
for you

CHACE

Dont bother He wouldnt pay a dime
for me Neither would anyone else

FRANCESCI
Ive never met anyone who couldnt
think of someone who would pay for
his life

CHACE
Theres a first time for everything
Now are you going to drive me back
or am I going to walk out the front
door

EXT INDUSTRIAL HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

INT GAILS APARTMENT -- FRONT DOORWAY -- DAY
Chace stands in Gails doorway She seems taken aback

GAIL
Youve got to remember who the Gettys
are Every time someone stays in

making jokes about being held for
ransom He might have cracked a
joke once or twice among friends --

CHACE
Theres that word again
GAIL
What word
CHACE

A joke When it first happened you
said you thought it was a joke

GAIL
Now you sound like that policeman

CHACE
Did Paul ever talk to you about having
himself kidnapped

Im on my own side always And if
theres a joke I like to make sure
Im in on it

DEL ROVERE
The lady needed money

CHACE
So do I

Chace blinks

Sicilian

DEL ROVERE
So do we all But Gail Getty gave
up a chance to make a fortune in her
divorce Did you know

CORVO
We calculated the money Ms Getty
could have expected in her settlement
The number was 15 to 18 million
dollars Quite a coincidence

CHACE
Im impressed you had any time at
all to look for the kid

CORVO
Then there is the matter of Gails
lover

Its a police booking photo

CORVO (CONTD)
Luigi Della Ratta A casino croupier
very much a ladies man with reputed
criminal connections

Chace stares at the photo

DEL ROVERE
It should have been obvious A pretty
lady like this expensive tastes so
insistent to get Getty to pay the
ransom --

CORVO
But never does she cry for her child
How can a mother not cry

Chace pushes the photo away

CHACE
Nice work fellas

DEL ROVERE
And you Have you learned anything

CHACE
Nothing Brick wall

DEL ROVERE
You look like youve tasted something
you dont like If you dont like
your drink just get another

Corvo takes out a picture of a handsome

CHACE
This is going to kill the old man
It has to stay out of the papers

DEL ROVERE
Nothing leaves this table Its for
the best eh There was never any
danger You have only to wait for
the boy to return

Del Rovere rises and Corvo with him He nods at a DARK-
HAIRED BEAUTY at the other end of the bar and leans in

DEL ROVERE (CONTD)
A single man alone in Rome on the
Getty expense account I envy you

The two men grin as they leave Chace at the bar Chace
glances up at the TV On a Bolletino Straordinario the
SHAH OF IRAN is making a speech

SHAH OF IRAN (0S)
Of course the price of oil must rise
You increased the price of wheat you
sell us by 300 its only fair that

EXT SUTTON PLACE -- REFLECTING POOLGARDENS -- DAY
J Paul Getty and Chace walk side-by-side

GETTY
I wish I could say Im surprised

Getty approaches a statue by the reflecting pool He puts
his hand upon it as if for support He seems badly shaken

CHACE
Are you all right Mr Getty

GETTY
When I wrote my book How to Be
Rich the publisher called me and
said they wanted to change the title
They wanted to call it How To Get
Rich They thought it would sell
more copies

(MORE )

GETTY (CONTD)
(shakes his head)
I told them getting rich is easy
Any fool can get rich anda
remarkable number of fools do

CHACE
Ive noticed that

GETTY
But being rich -- thats hard See
the ordinary working man has to go
to work to feed his family Maybe
he hates his job hates his boss
but the drive for survival gives him
a purpose in life When a man gets
rich hes faced with the problem of
freedom An abyss opens up before
him Ive seen it ruin men and
marriages and most of all it ruins
the children

CHACE
Hes a kid Kids do stupid things

GETTY
I thought I could trust my own blood

CHACE
Hes probably lying on a beach
somewhere When he gets bored or
runs out of money hell come home
And hell have learned his lesson

GETTY
I wanted to give him everything
give him all my knowledge all Ive
built and he just wanted to pick my
pocket Like his father like his
uncle like the parasites that have
swarmed around me my entire life

Getty walks on through his sculpture garden

GETTY (CONTD)
Thats why I like things see They
are what they appear to be and they
never change They never disappoint
Theres a purity to beautiful things
that Ive never been able to find in
another human being

CHACE
Neither have I
(MORE )

CHACE (CONTD)
(off his look)
You were right not to pay the ransom
You were right to follow your gut

Getty turns away from Chace suddenly distant

GETTY
You performed well This will be
reflected in your year-end bonus

CHACE
Thank you Mr Getty

and begins to urinate

He zips up and climbs back up the ravine Paul stares at
him for a moment then quickly looks away

CHIPMUNK (CONTD)

Paul shakes his head closing his eyes and refusing to turn
his back Chipmunk gives up He kicks the ski mask again

Chipmunk grabs Paul and drags him back down the hill toward
the squat stucco house in the distance

EXT STONE HOUSE -- EVENING
Paul is tethered to a rock by a rope around his neck as goats
graze around him He watches the little house inside

Piccolo Cinquanta and Chipmunk are arguing

Paul leans over and pulls at the tether Desperate he begins
to chew on it The mens voices grow ever louder

Then they fall silent The front door of the house opens
and three men walk out -- Cinguanta and Chipmunk in the lead
with the bow-legged Piccolino falling behind

CHIPMUNK

Chipmunk is carrying his shotgun He chambers a shell
Paul begins to whimper desperately

PAUL

this up to soak me

about being kidnapped with his friends
He may have put it out there but I
dont believe hes behind this

would persuade my father-in-law to
pay the ransom

twist J Paul Gettys arm

Mr Getty tends to listen to those
he considers his equals

MARCINKUS

He offers a bite to the boy as you would to a child

PAUL

The Doctor exits his examination finished Cinquanta leaves
the plate on the floor Paul takes a bite of the steak

CINQUANTA
If I could Id take your place

Cinquanta turns and walks outside leaving Paul alone Paul
spits out the morsel He takes out the Bic pen and the box
of matches hidden inside the waistband of his pants

QUICK CUTS Paul uses the steak knife to scrape the
phosphorous off the match heads He removes the ink tube
from the pen and packs it with the phosphorous

He goes to work on the shackle that chains him to the barn
floor attacking the floorboards with the knife

He hears the VOICES of the men He looks through a crack in
the wall Theyre drinking and singing outside the farmhouse

He pulls on the chain again leaning into it Finally it
gives He falls the chain CLATTERING across the floor

THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE WALL the men fall silent then
resume their carousing Paul picks up the pen tube and raises
it to his lips like a peashooter He lights a match --

brilliantly like a Roman candle He aims it through the

Then the wind picks up The embers begin to glow and scatter

THE ENTIRE FIELD IS ABLAZE Paul climbs out of the wood
shed with the broken chain slung over his shoulder He

disappears into the wheat field

The flames threaten to overtake the barn the men from the
house come running desperate to rescue the boy inside

it The wind whips the smoke into a black cloud behind him

We PULL BACK to gaze down upon the young boy as runs the
great field of fire spreading in his wake

You and me -- we never risked a thing
in our lives We never took the
chances ordinary people take Thats
why we are what we are now

Chace turns to go Getty grabs his arm

Those children are my blood Chace
They were mine And she took them
I was left with nothing

The old mans eyes brim with tears Chace stares at him
and beyond him at the palace filled with treasures

A great log fire burns in the fireplace

Getty sits up in bed the room is unfamiliar to him Theres

a strangeness to his surroundings as if the old man has

come unmoored 2001-like in time

One side of Gettys face has gone completely slack hes
obviously suffered a stroke in the night He steps into his
slippers and shuffles along the marble floors in his pajamas --

pats himself down searching for a gun that isnt there He
kicks a loose cobblestone and picks it up

Marble emperors gaze down at him with their lightless eyes

Getty shuffles on until he finds his prized painting --
Albrecht Diirers Madonna and Child in a Window He reaches
and takes it from the wall --

-- and the silent alarm goes off The doors at either end
of the hallway SLAM SHUT and the power cuts out

EXT FIAT 123 -- AUTOSTRADA -- NIGHT

The Fiat makes its way back to Rome along the serpentine
highway its headlights blazing

Chace drives Gail and Paul sit in the back seat silent and
apart still recovering from what theyve just endured

We see the LIGHTS of Rome in the distance But then we
realize that the lights are from TV cameras

The Italian press has paid off the people at the toll gates
Theyve formed a gauntlet of TV and still cameras to force
the car to stop so they can get a photograph of Paul

Instead Chace hits the gas and blows through the toll gate
The paparazzi are forced to scramble and chase them

Ms Getty we offer our sincerest
condolences

For what

She looks at the empty chair

GAIL (CONTD)
Oh Youre very thoughtful

HINGE
Please sit Mr Gettys death has
created a bit of a crisis here You
see Mr Getty never groomed a
successor Or rather he tried to --
GAIL
But he destroyed them all
(off his look)
I dont think he planned on dying
He thought that was negotiable too

HINGE
Yes well As a result the Getty
estate has become a family fortune
in search of a family

TAX ATTORNEY
You see the estate was structured
as a charitable family trust

GAIL
Did he ever give any money to charity

HINGE
No The trust enabled Mr Getty to
build his fortune without paying
taxes The problem is the trust
has rules It throws off interest
The interest must be spent Its a
staggering amount of money

GAIL
What do you want from me

HINGE
How do I put this The King is dead
and the throne is vacant Someone
has to take his place

GAIL
That money destroyed my family

HINGE
So you dont want it

We HOLD on Gail Then

GAIL
No Give it to me

The other attorney slides a stack of documents toward her
Atop the stack is the beautiful gold fountain pen that she
used to sign her children away

She twists off the cap The nib is as sharp as a knife
She sets it down and signs on the dotted line

DOCENT
J Paul Getty believed deeply in the
power of art to make us aware of our
shared humanity and that this legacy
belonged to every man and woman
rich or poor It was his
philanthropic vision that made this
museum possible

Gail and Chace exchange a look

CHACE
Who wrote that
