FADE IN

EXT OCEAN - EVENING Al
Dark waters barely lit just past sunset ROPES of a fishing net
disappear into the forbidding depths We hear the CRANK of a

winch as it turns On the bow of his ship a Spanish FISHERMAN
pulls his net up out of the sea

Slowly deep underwater the DIM OUTLINE of a SHAPE appears
caught in the net

CREE-YAK CREE-YAK the winch turns The shape resolves into a
DEAD BODY it grows more clear as it rises closer

The body breaks the surface along with seaweed and flapping
fish it is an ANCIENT SAILOR The Fisherman cries out --

FISHERMAN

The net spills onto the deck Quickly the CAPTAIN is there At
exactly the same time they make the sign of the cross

The Captain leans close One arm across the sailor’s chest still
clutches a wide thin book The Captain reaches --

SUDDENLY the Sailor’s EYES OPEN he GRABS the Captain’s arm --

INT PALACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 3
DOORS BURST OPEN The Fisherman and Captain enter using a sail
as makeshift litter carrying the ancient Sailor Unkempt beard
the tattered clothes of a castaway shivering at death’s door

He still clutches the book to his chest --

FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION hurrying across the floor is KING
FERDINAND Young dashing the arrogance of authority

The Sailor is lowered to the floor as the King arrives --

Ferdinand holds up a hand that they should be silent The Sailor
opens his eyes Struggles then words come faint --

SATLOR
Ponce de Leon

Ferdinand is amazed He glances back --

Joining the group is a darkly-tanned man Experience in his
eyes He will be known only as THE SPANIARD

The King gently removes the book It’s a ship’s log

CAPTAIN
Says he found Ponce de Leon’s ship --

FISHERMAN
Or sailed on it --

CAPTAIN
No I told you Ponce de Leon died two
hundred years ago --

FISHERMAN
Aye but he died searching for
something didn’t he

Ferdinand stares at a page Amid the hand-written entry is an
archaic symbol drawn in ink

KING FERDINAND
The Fountain of Youth

He glances down at the Sailor -- who now lies motionless

KING FERDINAND (CONTD)
How soon can you sail

POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 5

EXT LONDON - BRIDGE - DAY

The wagon rattles across the populated bridge the Dome of St
Paul’s cathedral and London skyline in the distance

INT PADDY WAGON - DAY
Jack and Gibbs share the flask

JACK
What happened Gibbs I thought you had
another gig

GIBBS
Aye But I always listened like a thief
for news of the Black Pearl No ones
seen hide nor hair of it where it might
be docked or next make port And then I
hear a rumor Jack Sparrow’s in London

JACK
Am not

GIBBS
But that’s what I heard Jack Sparrows
in London with a ship and looking for
a crew Fact is you’re signing men up
tonight pub called the Captain’s
Daughter

JACK
Am not

GIBBS
I thought it a bit odd But then you’ve
never been the most predictable of
sorts

Jack corks the flask puts it back in his jacket Gibbs

POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310

JACK
Truth is Jack Sparrow arrived in town
just this morning to rescue one
Joshmamee Gibbs from one appointment
with the gallows Youre alive so

Like I said Unpredictable

JACK
So There’s another Jack Sparrow out
there sullying my good name

GIBBS
An imposter

JACK
Aye But an imposter with a ship

GIBBS
And in need of a crew

JACK
That could be our ticket

the rolled-up map to the Fountain of Youth

GIBBS
What about you Jack Last I heard you
were hell bent to find the Fountain of
Youth Any luck

JACK
(pulls out the map)
Circumstances arose ensued and forced
a compelling insight regarding
discretion and valor --

GIBBS
Meaning you gave up

JACK
So untrue I am just as bent as ever
hellishly so I’ll taste those waters
Gibbs mark my words --

GIBBS
There’s the Jack I know

JACK

Two Guards march Jack down a wide elegant hallway

The Guards secure Jack with chains to the chair then exit

closing the doors In front of Jack is a vast table laden with
food Jack licks his lips The food beckons but he’s too far

away to reach it

He looks around High ceiling chandelier tall drapes high
balcony Enormous mural featuring King George II

Jack bounces the chair closer to the table His wrists are bound
to his sides So he KICKS the table from underneath --

A creme puff BOUNCES on its plate
Similar kicks bring it closer Then he kicks the side of the

table maneuvering the cream puff to the edge Finally he can
just get the toe of his boot under the cream puff --

DOORS OPEN startling Jack he kicks the cream puff high in the
air onto the chandelier above -- where it STICKS Jack settles
back legs crossed going for nonchalance

The Captain of the Guards leads in a column of GUARDS Next come
a retinue of SERVANTS Next Lord JOHN CARTERET Prime Minister
HENRY PELHAM Finally --

KING GEORGE He heaves his bulk into a wide chair on the other
side of the table opposite Jack begins to eat

CARTERET
You are Jack Sparrow

JACK
There should be a Captain in there
somewhere

GEORGE
I have heard of you
(Jack smiles at that)
And you know who I am

JACK
The face mmm familiar

PELHAM
You are in the presence of George
Augustus Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector of the
Holy Roman Empire King of Great Britain
and Ireland and of you

JACK
Doesn’t ring a bell

GEORGE
I am informed you have come to London to
procure a crew for your ship

Jack nervously rattles the chains

JACK
Vicious rumor Not true

GEORGE
No I’m quite certain that’s what my
ministers told me Jack Sparrow has come
to London to procure a crew

JACK
It may be true that that’s what you were
told but it’s nonetheless false that I
have come to London to procure a crew

GEORGE
Then you lied to me when you told me you
were Jack Sparrow

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 11

JACK
No I am Jack Sparrow but it’s not true
that Jack Sparrow has come to London to
procure a crew

GEORGE
Are you now claiming not to be in
London

JACK

No no I am Jack Sparrow And I am in
London But I am not here to procure a
crew That’s someone else

GEORGE
Ah Someone else named Jack Sparrow
(to Carteret)
You’ve brought me the wrong wastrel
Find Jack Sparrow and dispose of this
impostor

Jack’s chain-rattling grows louder more annoying
JACK
Wait I am Jack Sparrow the one and
only And I am in London
GEORGE
To procure a crew To undertake a voyage
to the Fountain of Youth

JACK
What

Jack’s rattling gets even louder George waves a hand

GEORGE
Someone remove those infernal chains

Exactly what Jack wanted A very TALL GUARD steps forward

JACK
How much do you weigh

The Guard just sneers at him He pulls away the chains Jack
stands Picks up a napkin dabs his face

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 12
14 PELHAM
We know you are in possession of a map

CARTERET
So confiscate the map and to the
gallows with him

GEORGE
Have you a map

Jack shrugs Tosses the napkin away letting it drop to the
floor Reaches into his pocket The map is gone He searches
pats his pockets It’s really not there Jack looks relieved

JACK
No
PELHAM
Where is it
JACK
The truth I lost it Quite recently in
fact
GEORGE

I have a report Trustworthy The
Spanish have located the Fountain of

Youth
(vehement )

I will not have some melancholy Spanish
Monarch -- a Catholic -- gain eternal
life

PELHAM
You do know the way to the Fountain

JACK
Absolutely Yes

CARTERET

You could guide an expedition

JACK
With your permission

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 13 14

Jack drags a heavy chair scra-a-a-ping across the floor next to
the table Positions it just so Sits puts his feet up

JACK (CONTD)
Youll be providing then a ship anda
crew

GEORGE
And a Captain

A Guard opens a door We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching But not
normal footsteps A step then a SCRAPE Step then a SCRAPE
Out of the darkness emerges --

HECTOR BARBOSSA

But a different Barbossa He wears a Naval officer’s hat A
Privateers coat He leans on a crutch stands on one leg the
other wooden from the knee down

Barbossa bows before the King

BARBOSSA
Afternoon sire
(notices Jack)
Why is that man not in chains He must
be manacled at once

GEORGE
At the centre of my palace Hardly

BARBOSSA
If I may be so bold Jack Sparrow be
easy enough to catch It’s holding him’s
the problem

JACK
Hector Good to see a fellow pirate make
something of himself

BARBOSSA

Pirate Privateer On a sanctioned
mission under the authority and
protection of the Crown

JACK
As may be But first What became of the
Pearl
BARBOSSA
Lost
JACK

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 13A-14 14

BARBOSSA
I defended her mightily But she be
sunk nonetheless

Without warning Jack springs forward -- makes it all way face-
to-face with Barbossa before the Guards grab him --

JACK
If that ship be lost properly you
should be lost with it

BARBOSSA
Aye In a kinder world

Guards aim rifles at Jack’s head

GEORGE
Captain Barbossa Each second we tarry
the Spanish outdistance us I have every
confidence you will prevail and be
rewarded with the high station you so
desire

Barbossa turns to the King bows

JACK
You sir have stooped

BARBOSSA
Our sands be all but run Where’s the
harm in joining the winning side

JACK
But Hector the wig

Suddenly Jack slams the Guards together shoves their rifles
upwards they both FIRE --

FLINGS IT AHEAD into the stained glass window --

They are on the second floor it’s a long way down Jack grabs
the ropes to the curtains just as the Tall Guard comes
barreling his way --

-- the Tall Guard slips on the napkin (again as planned) --

Out of control the Tall Guard flails out the window Jack
politely hands the curtain ropes to him as he passes by The
Tall Guard plummets down Jack hanging onto the other rope
RISES UP just ahead --

-- of the slashing sword blade of the Captain of the Guards --

From the valance Jack leaps for the chandelier (catching it
just as it swings towards him) --

-- and Jack swings from the chandelier to the high balcony He
pauses raises a hand -- along the way Jack has recovered the
creme puff He bites chews swallows and is gone

GEORGE
He escaped

The chandelier CRASHES into the center of the table Barbossa
smiles at the King

BARBOSSA
Leave it to me

mandola slung around his neck is SCRUM A line of sailor-types
wait in front of him

TEAGUE (CONTD)
And Jackie One last thing The Fountain
will test you mark my words

Jack nods takes a long drink Turns back to Teague -- who isn’t

The pirates in line congratulate him Jack steps forward
notices light spilling out of the room and a TALL SHADOW cast
on the opposite wall --

A SILHOUETTE in the form of Jack Sparrow

Jack tilts his head admiring He tries to see around the corner
-- then he leaps out into the room --

INT CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
-- but no one is there Jack hears a noise turns --

JACK SPARROW steps out of the darkness Same outfit same
dreads same swagger face obscured in shadow Jack draws his
sword Other Jack draws his sword too A challenge

JACK
You’ve stolen me and I’m here to take
myself back

The two Jacks hide behind a post peek out at each other

The two Jacks leap forward at the same instant with exactly the
same slashing attack Swords CLASH the pair are completely
evenly matched

The two leap onto the hearth face off When Jack moves Other
Jack does too

JACK (CONTD)
Stop doing that

Jack dodges rolls expertly onto a crate The other Jack
executes the exact same roll Jack tosses his sword back and
forth between right and left hand Other Jack does so too

The pair fight up a ramp Other Jack rolls barrels down Jack
evades --

IN THE RAFTERS Other Jack spins ready --

But no one is there Other Jack searches looks down through the
rafters -- nothing

Suddenly a set of hanging barrels PLUMMET down Other Jack
springs back Thinks spins raises a sword as Jack rises up
behind pulled up by the rope that holds the barrels --

-- their swords clash --

ON THE RAFTERS they battle Other Jack swings a pulley at Jack -
- Jack grabs it the pulley breaks Jack lands on a stack of
barrels Other Jack leaps down fights as barrels roll out from
beneath them A flash of intricate swordplay --

JACK (CONTD)
Only one person alive knows that move

Suddenly -- shockingly -- Jack leans forward and KISSES Jack
Full on A good kiss Jack pulls back --

POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 19A

JACK (CONTD)
So that’s what that’s like

Other Jack is smiling eyes closed enjoying the aftermath of
the kiss

JACK (CONTD)
Hello Angelica

Jack pulls away her fake beard
ANGELICA

Hello Jack Are you impressed I think
I almost killed you once or twice there

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 20

Angelica peels off her mustache
JACK
I am touched at this most sincerest form
of flattery But why
Jack uses his sword to flip away her hat
ANGELICA
You were the only pirate I thought I
would pass for

Angelica slips out of her wig and bandana

JACK
That is not a compliment

ANGELICA
Dont worry I have long since forgiven
you

JACK

For leaving you
Jack rips open her bodice revealing a very womanly figure

ANGELICA
Recall that I left you

She moves away from him

JACK
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain
her fictions

ANGELICA
As long as my sailors get their money
they will put up with any number of
peculiarities and peccadilloes

Jack has followed peeks at her from around a post

JACK
There is one pecadilly up with which I
will not put I will be impersonated as
Captain nothing less

ANGELICA
For that you need a ship and as it
turns out I have one
Angelica crosses to a water bucket to clean up

JACK
I could use a ship

A26 AT THE DOOR Scrum appears He glances back out into the pub

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 21

ANGELICA
I hear-tell you’ve been to the Fountain

JACK

these days

ANGELICA

A26

There is a SLAM at the door Scrum locks it puts his weight on

Estes

ANGELICA
Yes You seduced me you betrayed me

ANGELICA
You want to rescue me Jack

JACK
Blackbeard has served his purpose Land
is within reach You and I can flee go
on to the Fountain together There’1l be
fame enough to share

ANGELICA
And I tell you the ritual of the
Fountain

JACK

The profane ritual

The SWAY of the ship takes them out of the rigging Jack turns
it into an elegant spin

ANGELICA
And the fact that saving me lies
directly in line with your self-interest
is entirely coincidental

JACK
Coincidentally

ANGELICA
I dont believe you

JACK
When once a liar speaks the truth he
yearns for trust so

Jack grabs a line Gets a running start swings off into the
night Then swoops in behind her drops lightly to the deck

I have something for you Proof you are
never far from my thoughts The first
item I ever stole

for someone else

ANGELICA
I had to trade it To learn the rules of
the Fountain

JACK
Ah And

ANGELICA
I haven’t seen you with such desire
since St Lucia Short lived as I
recall

JACK
(a whisper)
Tell me the rules

ANGELICA
Are we partners Can I trust you I need
you on my side Jack

JACK
We are thick as thieves Angelica

He slips the ring onto her finger In return she whispers

ANGELICA

shimmering tear of a Mermaid The Silver
Cups of Cartagena with these items

Yes

Jack turns away -- feels compelled to turn back --

Angelica holds up the JACK VOODOO DOLL She exhales her breath
down its neck -- and Jack shivers shakes himself

ANGELICA (CONTD)
I wonder Does it work because it works
or because you believe that it works

She strokes the doll softly and again Jack shivers

JACK
Or because I want you to believe that it
works

ANGELICA

Or because you want me to believe you
are only pretending for it to work when
in fact it does Nothing is beyond you

She drags the Voodoo doll along her neck Up behind her ear

ANGELICA (CONTD)
You are unpredictable Jack Untamable
Thats why I’m drawn to you

JACK
And you smell nice But that’s beside
the point

Jack is jerked forward as she drifts the doll to her bosom

Sparrow that you want me

ANGELICA
-- and two silver Chalices One cup with
the tear one without

JACK
So one with a tear -- and water in
both These things can get complicated

ANGELICA
I’m going to say it again Both get
water One gets a tear The person who
drinks the water with the tear gets all
the years of life from the other

JACK
How many years

A rather larger snake swims near Jack jumps behind Angelica
Angelica grabs it wields it at Jack

ANGELICA
(a la Tia Dalma)
“All da years dat dey have lived and
they could have lived if fated been

She tosses the snake away Moves on Jack follows

starts to move away --

Philip moves close to the glass Syrena rises up and transforms130
to her half-human state Her eyes full of reproach meet his

The Quartermaster laughs Philip takes the opportunity to grab
the Quartermaster’s sword wedges up the cover breaking the
seal Syrena goes to the crack breathes the air hungrily

shoves his bible in place keeping the glass open Syrena

Dense foliage crisscrossing vines A downward machete-slash-
reveals Jack leading the way

PULL BACK ahead of him is the edge of a chasm A vast drop down
to a rocky river below Jack calls back --

JACK
As I thought Not this way --

Too late Angelica notes what Jack has seen the remains of a
bridge pylons on each side rope hanging

ANGELICA
This is the way isn’t it

JACK
We can go around To the east
POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310

ANGELICA
But that would take us out of the path
of the Chalices

Jack doesn’t want to admit it but it does

JACK
Aye well then we circle back

Angelica glances at the Quartermaster who shakes his

ANGELICA
We don’t have time

JACK
Well you insisted on bringing a mermaid

ANGELICA
The mutiny didn’t help --

JACK
You walk like a girl --

ANGELICA
You would know --

Blackbeard paces like a caged animal Finally --

BLACKBEARD
Someone must go

ANGELICA
You mean split up

JACK
You mean jump

Blackbeard turns to Jack
BLACKBEARD

retrieve the Chalices

JACK
A day’s march north following that

pools Then you’re close

Blackbeard plucks the Compass out of Jack’s hand Jack reaches
for it thinks the better of it

BLACKBEARD
You will go

JACK
You know that feeling you get
sometimes standing in a high place a
sudden urge to jump I’m not feeling
that

Blackbeard pulls one of his pistols aims it a Jack

BLACKBEARD
I need those Chalices

JACK
Shoot Save me the bother of the fall

Blackbeard considers moves his pistol over to Angelica
BLACKBEARD
You will go and you will return or I
will kill her
Jack sees he will do it Still Jack gives it a try --

JACK
You would not kill your own daughter

BLACKBEARD
Quartermaster Take seven pistols
Remove the shot in all but two Do not
tell me which two

CLOSE ON a pistol as it is set down by the Quartermaster the
last of seven pistols in line on a rock shelf

Blackbeard leads Jack back to the pistols

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Choose one
POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 71A 131
Blackbeard indicates for Jack to choose a pistol Disbelieving

Jack does so Blackbeard points it at Angelica pulls the
trigger -- click

JACK
Please None of them are loaded --

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 72 131

Jack picks one of the pistols points it a tree pulls the
trigger -- it FIRES Jack is shocked

JACK (CONTD)
If you’re so willing to kill her let
her jump

ANGELICA
What

BLACKBEARD
If you jump and die then I will see she
gets her chance

Blackbeard picks up another pistol Suddenly Jack turns to the
Quartermaster

JACK
You If I jump Will I survive

The Quartermaster stares at Jack a long time He steps over to
Angelica

QUARTERMASTER
The doll

Angelica hands him the doll He moves to the edge -- throws the
doll over

ANGLE ON the Jack VooDoo doll as it falls it seems to be
SCREAMING --

The doll SPLASHES into a narrow crevice between two rocks

BACK ON THE LEDGE it was Jack who was screaming The
Quartermaster turns to Jack who shuts up

QUARTERMASTER (CONTD)
Yes Now you will survive

ANGELICA
This is nonsense I’m going

Angelica moves to the edge of the chasm Suddenly with a yell
Jack races past her leaping out into space He plummets down --

-- lands in the river between the rocks with a HUGE SPLASH A 132
tense moment then Jack bobs up alive

He disappears into the jungle Philip sets Syrena down onto the
giant roots of a fig tree She withdraws eyes downcast

PHILIP
Such beauty Surely you are one of Gods
own creations and not as some tell a
descendant of those dark creatures who
found no refuge on the Ark

Syrena turns her eyes to him

Philip Syrena cries out --

The Quartermaster holds the knife out the blade drips with

Taken not lost We were off the coast
of Hispaniola when we came under attack
No provocation nor warning nor offer of
parley We were peppered with cannon
fire And then the sea beneath the Pearl
began to roil

(beat)
The Pearl was pitching and yawing
violently So violently we could not
maneuver could not man the cannons
5 so violently it actually came to my
mind to give the order

(off Jack’s look)
THE order THE order The order no man
who calls himself captain ever dreams
he’1l be givin’

(beat)
Abandon ship

Jack has been there he understands

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
But too late The Pearl began to creak
every plank every rail every spar all
at once making a hellish noise like
none I have ever heard and I have
heard my share of hellish noises

Aye As have I

Blackbeard appears with the rest of the landing party

BLACKBEARD

Jack steps aside Behind him a good twenty feet away Gibbs
holds down a WILD BOAR squealing and struggling

Tied to the back of the boar are the silver Chalices

EXT JUNGLE - CAVE APPROACH - DAY 163

An absolutely huge palm frond is pushed aside revealing Jacks
entire body He looks this way and that

JACK
I swear it was somewhere right around
here

Jack steps forward followed by Angelica Blackbeard
Blackbeard’s entourage and a bound Philip

CLOSE ON a second frond is pushed aside behind it is only
Jacks face The frond is small Jack examines it notes a drop
of water on its edge He shakes the drop onto his hand --

The drop dances through Jacks fingers moving in and around
seeming at times to defy gravity dripping upwards and bending
forward --

Jack follows the angle of the drop looks THROUGH THE WATER
DROP and sees carved in the rock wall the precise archaic
symbol that was on Ponce de Leon’s map and in the ship’s log
book When the drop flies upwards off Jack’s finger the
distortion is gone and the symbol is gone as well

Beneath the rock wall is REVEALED a cave entrance darkness
arching over deep still waters

Jack smiles He knows he’s close
INT BLUE CAVE - ENTRANCE - DAY 164

Torches in hand the Landing Party climbs down a steep incline
to the cave mouth silhouettes against the sunlit opening behind

INT BLUE CAVE - DAY 165

The group sloshes through A blue tint to the light reflected
off the water Stalactites hang from the darkness above

Ahead of the group a Pirate reaches out touches one of the
stalactites Next to him a huge stalactite crashes down
impaling a Second Pirate beneath it

The group climbs over and around the dead Pirate --

Jack moves cautiously ahead -- until they reach a blank wall

JACK
Ah Dead end

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 95

BLACKBEARD
Dead end

JACK
Yep

ANGELICA

Jack I’m starting to think you don’t
know where you’re going

JACK
It’s not the destination so much as the
journey they say The Chalices if you
please

Blackbeard indicates Jack be given the Chalices The

Quartermaster steps forward pulls the Chalices from a pouch He

is protective of them mistrustful and reluctantly hands them

over

Jack takes them holds one in each hand spreads his arms then

with a flourish brings them together -- they CHIME

All wait The chime FADES Jack’s confident look falters He
CHIMES them again Nothing

Angelica moves toward Jack stalking him

ANGELICA
Jack Have you ever in fact seen with
your own eyes heard with your own ears
or stood with those clumsy smelly feet
at the Fountain of Youth

JACK
You know I never actually said that I
had

Blackbeard cries out in anger outrage He pulls one of his
pistols FIRES at Jack --

-- in reflex Jack raises a Chalice to his face the bullet
ricochets off Jack gazes at the dent in wonder

Blackbeard aims another pistol -- Jack raises his hand

JACK (CONTD)
Wait

Jack stares at the Chalices CLOSE ON the inscribed words
‘Aqua’ on one Chalice and ‘de Vida’ on the other

JACK (CONTD)
Aqua de Vida
POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 95A

There is the immediate SOUND of water All look see along

the sides of the cave the odd sight of water RISING Just a
trickle at first --

POTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 96 165

More and more WATER appears moving upwards Rivulets turn to
streams collecting upwards into a pool above their heads

They stare not sure what to do -- and then a bird flies into
the cave a colorful TOH with distinctive tail -- and INTO the
rising water The bird SHOOTS upwards --

JACK (CONTD)
Interesting

INT CAVE - DAY 166

Jack gestures for Scrum who steps over Jack shoves the
Chalices at him as he unceremoniously climbs onto Scrum’s back
He pulls his sword pushes it up into the pool -- the sword is
wrenched from his hand a strong current carrying it UPWARDS --

It disappears Jack shrugs pushes upwards INTO THE WATER --
suddenly SHOOTS UPWARDS --

CLOSE ON Jack’s sword lies on the rocks Jack grabs it raises 167
his eyes -- Angelica and Blackbeard climb out of a pool behind
him all look out at --

THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH

Before them a natural basin filled with water the base of a
tall crevice sunlight beams down from above Lush covered with
vines

In the center a raised mound with stone steps littered with
ancient human skeletons all is covered with moss On top of
the mound is a large natural open stone formation in the form
of a circle A delicate stream of water pours from a crack in
its middle

Around the stone are huge carved structures artifacts of some
civilization long past Scattered about are skeletons victims
of previous expeditions

The group moves across the cavern through the water onto the
wide stepping stones taking in the scene with awe

ANGELICA
So beautiful

Jack is entranced He comes up to the central stone As he
approaches some of the vines move growing backwards
withdrawing from the central stone Jack reaches to touch the
water --

those waters

Behind them -- surprise -- Barbossa is there he steps forward
leaning on his crutch stops Behind him his entire party
including Groves and Gillette emerge rising up from the pool
Blackbeard doesn’t even need to look

BLACKBEARD
Ah The one-legged man

BARBOSSA
Aye

Blackbeard glances at the Quartermaster who nods

BLACKBEARD
You came As you must The instrument of
my demise

ANGELICA
You brought him here

As I musted

Barbossa strides forward speaking for all to hear --

BARBOSSA
Edward Teach For crimes committed on
the high seas by the authority granted
me by His Majesty the King and with a
goodly amount of personal satisfaction
I hereby place you in the custody of the
court and declare you my prisoner

Blackbeard removes his coat readying to battle

BLACKBEARD
My trick’s over is that it

BARBOSSA
Such crimes do include but are not
limited to piracy treason murder
torture of a most heinous sorts
including the brutal theft of one used
twisted hairy right leg including
foot and five toes

The two sides race forward Suddenly Jack is between them

JACK

Everyone actually stops Jack is surprised but goes with it
counts each side bobbing his finger

He looks at Scrum who shrugs he doesnt know
JACK (CONTD)
Exactly I say let ‘em fight each other
while we lay back watch and place
wagers Aye
For a moment it seems they all might go for it Then --

BARBOSSA
Kill them

BLACKBEARD
No quarter

The two sides rush each other swords clashing --

Barbossa takes on Blackbeard Two expert swordsmen fearless
crafty fighting over the slippery stones --

Jack darts away from the fight back around the Fountain
Barbossa loses his sword knocks Blackbeard away with his

crutch Blackbeard spins thrusts his sword a killing blow
just as Gillette is knocked into the sword’s path

He

Gillette gets run through and falls back dead into Barbossa’s
arms Barbossa stares a moment then tosses him aside --

-- Barbossa retrieves his sword as Blackbeard pulls his sword
out of Gillette the two re-engage --

-- elsewhere Salaman turns towards the a British soldier who
ulls back his sword and slashes hard -- but Salaman drops
into a deep hole and so avoids losing his head --

The British Soldier staggers forward having missed Garheng
helps pull Salaman out of the hole and they race away --

Scrum nods clutches the pouch with the Mermaid’s tear A 171
British Soldier cuts him off so he takes another route -- but
then Jack appears cutting him off

JACK
Hand it over The tear There’s a good
lad

I’m more afraid of her than you
Scrum draws his sword --

ELSEWHERE the Quartermaster drives a British soldier back and 172
slays him He turns away Philip slides his bound wrists onto
the fallen soldier’s blade trying to cut his bonds --

Suddenly the Cabin Boy is there he quickly cuts the rope

CABIN BOY
Now we’re square

PHILIP
Square

The Cabin boy takes off as Philip stands and turns -- and 173
unexpectedly takes a sword thrust into his side from a passing
British SOLDIER Philip spins falls against a stone He presses
his hand to the wound turns and slips off back the direction
they came --

Jack faces off against Scrum moves his sword to his other hand174
and back again Scrum puts the pouch in his mouth and does the
same mirroring Jack Jack slams his foot into Scrum’s stomach

the pouch pops out Jack catches it

JACK
Hah

Jack turns -- and Angelica is there sword leveled Two Chalices
in her other hand Beside him Scrum pushes his sword into
Jack’s neck

ANGELICA
Hand it over there’s a good lad

POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 99A

ANGELICA
I’m sorry Jack I told you I need
years Yours will have to do

perfectly good sap

I could not steal the years of an
innocent man

JACK
You will need this then
(holds up the pouch)
And soon by the looks of it

Angelica glances over sees Barbossa fighting Blackbeard

ANGELICA
Don’t test me Jack

Jack nods Suddenly tosses the pouch toward her --

Angelica has no free hand to catch it so she tosses both
Chalices to Scrum and she catches the pouch --

Scrum catches both Chalices but only by dropping the sword to
Jacks neck --

JACK
Hah

Jack picks up Scrum’s sword tosses it hilt first at Angelica
She has to throw the pouch to Scrum to catch the sword

Jack snags the pouch out of the air Jack now has the pouch
back with his sword and Scrum is standing there holding the
Chalices in each hand Angelica has two swords Jack kicks the
Chalices away --

Angelica and Jack look at each other dive for them --

Angelica hesitates Soldiers push her to her knees take the two
silver Chalices Jack looks on hand on the pouch

The Chalices are given to the Spaniard He takes them gingerly
looks upon them with great satisfaction

Blackbeard stares livid Angelica watches with cold fury
Barbossa looks on satisfied Jack takes in the scene
calculating

The Spaniard turns toward the Fountain Raises the Chalices to
the sky He proclaims

SPANIARD (CONTD)
There is but One Source of life eternal
and it is not these pagan waters

Behind him all the Catholic Soldiers make the sign of the
cross Suddenly -- surprisingly -- the Spaniard throws the
Chalices to the ground Stomps on them --

Angelica gasps -- even Jack is surprised --

The Spaniard takes the bent Chalices and flings them far into
the water The silver glints as they sink into oblivion --

His men set quickly to work Boulders are toppled Ropes are 179

driving him to the ground

He turns away to oversee the destruction Blackbeard tries to
rise cannot He begins to convulse sweat

Angelica stares at Blackbeard looks to Barbossa

Angelica races to her father His hands are on the hilt of
Barbossa’s sword so she grabs it by the blade --

Angelica no --

Angelica pulls the sword out and lets it drop her hands slashed
and bleeding

JACK (CONTD)

No

BARBOSSA
Im not such the fool as to take on
Blackbeard without a little venomous
advantage

She realizes what she has done Stares at her hands --

choice join him They disappear as the Spanish continue the
destruction of the Fountain --

Jack leans down near the surface of the water searches
desperately for the Chalices Angelica collapses

ON JACK as he searches the waters Angelica and Blackbeard lay
still near death

One of the tall columns is tilted over SMASHING onto the
Fountain the final destructive blow

The Spaniard surveys his work

SPANIARD
Thy will be done

Nods gestures for his men to withdraw

Only Jack is left still searching He sees something Somethingl80
rising toward him out of the depths --

It is Syrena

Jack watches as she emerges from the water The silver Chalices -
- battered and twisted -- sparkle in her hands Syrena holds
them out He looks at her in wonder takes them and nods his
thanks

Syrena lowers her head suddenly twists and disappears back
into the water

Jack climbs quickly to the fallen cracked basin Very little
water left He fills one Chalice The water is running out he
fills the other getting the very last drop

The Fountain is now dry Jack removes the vial from the pouch
uncorks pours Jack rouses Angelica She sits up barely
conscious

ANGELICA
I am going to die

No Youre not Well yes But even so
you will be all right
Jack holds the two Chalices Raises the right Chalice

the tear
BLACKBEARD

I am sorry Angelica I am a bad man
Save me my daughter

She looks at him shocked deep in her eyes we see a familiar
hurt A glance at Jack -- who takes no joy in the fact that he
was right

Angelica takes the second cup Looks up at Blackbeard

ANGELICA
I love you father

-- and drinks Jack frowns Looks again at the two cups

JACK
Or wait was it the other way
around This cup had the tear that cup -

Blackbeard stands and suddenly the flowing waters of the
Fountain seem to find him Circle him Entwine him He is
covered in water chokes unable to breathe --

Angelica stands reaches for him -- his eyes bulge he is
drowning on dry land Angelica glances down The bleeding on her
hands has stopped Her skin closes over the wound smooth not
even a scar She whirls

ANGELICA (CONTD)
No Jack you bastard --

She sweeps up Barbossa’s sword faces Jack

ANGELICA (CONTD)
How could you

JACK
He saved you Maybe his soul is now
redeemed

Angelica curses raises the sword Hears a sound Looks --
Blackbeard’s body has already completely rotted away like a 181
corpse many months under the water His skin dissolves leaving

nothing but bones --

Jack looks sees -- the Zombies looking on collapse begin to
decompose

The water around Blackbeard suddenly drops Nothing is left
now but a standing skeleton

And yet Blackbeard’s will is so strong one last sad reach for
her hand and then his BONES loosen and FALL his skeleton
joining the others a few bones separating and clattering away
ANGELICA’s will is gone she crumples to the ground

She looks past him sees the small island ahead --
EXT SOLA FIDE BEACH - DAY 191

Angelica is flung down onto the sand Jack drops a pistol beside
her

JACK
A pistol One shot

ANGELICA
To kill myself before I starve

JACK
This is a well-travelled trade route
You could signal a passing ship

JACK (CONTD)
Or you could sing and lure some other
sailor to his doom

ANGELICA
How am I to get free of these bonds

Jack heads off readies the longboat for launch

JACK
You worked free of your bonds about a
half hour ago and youve been waiting
for a chance to jump me ever since

Jack whirls back -- and Angelica is RIGHT THERE her hands free
a piece of driftwood raised to club him
ANGELICA
Admit it You love me still
JACK
If you had a sister and a dog I’d

choose the dog

Jack pushes the boat to the water Angelica drops the driftwood
wades out from the shore

ANGELICA
Jack I am with child Yours
JACK
Funny I dont recall that we --
ANGELICA
You were drunk
JACK
There is not enough rum in the seven
seas
ANGELICA
Jack
(he stops)

Treasure There is a chest You close
the lid and when you open it whatever
you most desire is inside

Jack laughs again pushes the boat into the water
ANGELICA (CONTD)
Jewels Jewels with the power to rule
the wind and tide

JACK
Youre making that up

POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 111

ANGELICA
Dont go Theres something I have
to tell you
(turns him to her)
Words I have yearned to say from the
moment we first met and every moment

since

JACK
Oh

ANGELICA
I love you

JACK

As do I And so as an act of reverence
and ardor for us both --

Jack looks very pleased with himself --

JACK (CONTD)
Were through

Angelica expected a kiss gets only empty air Turns to see
Jack has pushed the longboat well out into the waves

ANGELICA
THIS IS NOT OVER

Angelica races back up the sand --

ON JACK as he rows away through the surf The SOUND of a
single SHOT he ducks Behind him water plumes

JACK
Missed

EXT COASTLINE - BEACH - SUNSET

The longboat mast in place but sail furled is beached on a

sandy shore A trail of footsteps leads to Jack as he walks away

from it to where --

Gibbs perched on gnarly driftwood roots waits for him

JACK
Gibbs you ugly besotted shellback you
made it

GIBBS
Aye

JACK

And I trust we managed a profit from our
joint enterprise
POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 112

GIBBS
Feast your eyes

Gibbs hops down points on one of the roots is the BLACK PEARL

encased in its glass bottle Jack stoops gazes at it

GIBBS (CONTD)
The Compass led me straight and true

JACK
What of Blackbeard’s men guarding the
ship

GIBBS

Jack I’m Joshamee Gibbs
Jack notes a gunny sack on the sand Gibbs follow his gaze

GIBBS (CONTD)
Seemed a shame to leave an entire Armada
behind

JACK
Shame indeed

Jack picks up the bottle He holds it eye level lining the
Black Pearl up with the horizon --

GIBBS
So Any idea how to get it out

193 INSIDE Jack’s face looms huge and distorted in the sky
Cotton’s Parrot SQUAWKS from the helmsman’s wheel Jack the
Monkey climbs to the crow’s nest SCREECHES out at them --

JACK
We will need a crossbow an hourglass
three goats and one of us must learn to
play the trumpet

GIBBS
I know a man with a goat

JACK
There’s a start

194 LATER ON THE BEACH Gibbs stoops hefts the sack bottles
inside clanking He looks like some Caribbean Santa Claus

GIBBS
Jack I have to ask There you were you
had the Chalices the water the tear
You could have lived well maybe
forever

Jack tucks the bottle under his arm

POoTC On Stranger Tides -WD- 11310 113

JACK
The Fountain tests you Gibbs But
not my style play it safe Better to
not know which moment may be your last
alive to the mystery of it all -- and
who’s to say I won’t live on Jack
Sparrow finder of the Fountain of
Youth I’ve no choice Gibbs --

Jack and Gibbs walk their footsteps in the sand stretch on to
forever ahead a spectacular crimson Caribbean sunset

JACK (CONTD)
It’s a pirate’s life for me

Angelica sits alone on the rocks gazing at the waves Notices
something sits up

Bobbing toward her as if delivered by fate is the Jack Sparrow
Voodoo doll

Angelica picks it up And smiles

CUT TO BLACK
