October 31 2007
As the TITLE FADES from the screen we focus on the GIANT
LETTER Q RACING through its center to find ourselves

EXT ARCTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

Soaring over ice floes scattered in the frigid water like
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle We speed towards a remote
settlement perched at the tip of a snow-covered peninsula

SUPER THULE GREENLAND
USAF LONG RANGE RADAR STATION

Icicles as big as broom-handles hang from the razor fences
surrounding a small cluster of hut-like STRUCTURES One of
them topped with a huge golfball-shaped RADAR DOME

INT RADAR HUT - NIGHT

In a rat’s nest of electronics TWO RADAR TECHS huddle
around a tiny old TV fiddling with its wires The picture
-- an old Hanna-Barbera cartoon -- fritzes in and out

One of them BANGS it with his fist The screen goes DEAD

RADAR TECH 1
And the American people can sleep
soundly knowing their safety lies
in our capable hands

RADAR TECH 2
Ha ha hang on We can fix this

He BANGS it again Again Just as he smacks it a third
time -- ASTREN SHATTERS THE STLENCE -- LIGHTS FLASHING --

RADAR TECH 2
-- did we do that --

-- It’s the EARLY WARNING ALARM Cocoa spills as they
scramble to their stations -- A BLIP on the RADAR screens

RADAR TECH 1
Contact Bearing three-nine-seven
4300 feet Relay

RADAR TECH 2
Relaying Jesus it’s fast What
do you think ICBM

RADAR TECH 1
Too fast Wait -- new heading
Two-one-one Altitude’s dropping
This thing’s coming down Hard

RADAR TECH 2
(realizing)
Two-one-one That’s --

-- THE FLOOR HEAVES LIKE IT’S BEEN HIT BY AN EARTHQUAKE
Shelves TOPPLE Monitors EXPLODE in a shower of sparks

And as quickly as it began it ends The techs pick
themselves off the floor Unhurt but shaken

RADAR TECH 2
What was that

EXT RADAR BASE - NIGHT

A RUT CUTS THROUGH THE SNOW like a long ditch dug in the
frozen earth It runs straight through the torn fences
Right through one of the huts rent in two smoking halves

It disappears over an icy ridge where an EERIE GLOW
EMANATES Waves of light shimmer in the sky almost like
the Aurora Borealis but Unsettling Unearthly

The techs scramble up the ridge and as they crest it we
BOOM UP to REVEAL what they discover

THE HUGE SHAPE OF A DOWNED FLYING-CRAFT

Lying in a crater of its own making What we can see of it
is like nothing we’ve ever seen Sleek Advanced Alien

The techs trade astonished looks their breath coming in
quick clouds of frozen fog

RADAR TECH 1
Call it in Now

SMASH CUT TO

KLEIG LIGHTS ARMED GUARDS HAZMAT CREWS The mystery
ship has been enclosed in a full-fledged military cordon

Amid this chaos a HELICOPTER touches down Its only
identifying mark is a tiny logo stamped on its door “I-11”

The door opens and CORVIN steps out She wears no
military insignia but she is unquestionably in charge An
old-school Cold Warrior she’s smart and shrewd and warm as
this weather She’s met by her right-hand man ROBERTS

CORVIN
(curt)
What is it Chinese or Russian
ROBERTS

Neither as far as we can tell
The hull seems to be one complete
piece -- we can’t find a door --
can’t get any readings inside
either -- EM ultrasound X-Ray

(nervous)
Also ma’am its inbound trajectory
seems to place its point of origin
somewhere out of orbit

CORVIN
You’re telling me this thing is --

ROBERTS
We’re not sure what it is We’re

out of our depth

CORVIN
(nods)
Get Quest

CUT TO

EXT ARMY BASE - DAY

Ten-foot razor fences enclose a desert of white-hot sand

SUPER WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS
LAS CRUCES NEW MEXICO

INT TEST HANGAR

DR BENTON QUEST

Mid-40s sporting a short red beard and a rumpled lab coat
stands in a huge closed hangar before a line of Ml ABRAMS
TANKS This section has been set aside for a

demonstration An audience of MILITARY BRASS waits nearby

Dr Quest is -- bar none -- our country’s finest scientific
mind When he speaks everybody listens

QUEST
Non-lethal weaponry -- truly non-
lethal -- has always made sense in

the abstract The reality

however has invariably been

ineffective inefficient or both

So the question remains how do

we provide able national defense

without unnecessary loss of life
(MORE)

QUEST (CONTD)
The answer gentlemen is the
latest innovation from Quest labs

One of Quest’s ASSISTANTS wheels a HIGH-TECH DEVICE into
the light It is the size of a broadcast TV camera coiled
with coolant tubes and high-voltage wires

QUEST
The Geodide Ray Now directed-
energy weapons aren’t a new
concept But the innovation here
lies not in what this weapon
destroys It lies in what it
doesn’t Allow me to demonstrate

He moves to the Ray’s controls enters an ACTIVATION CODE

QUEST
It’s secured by our proprietary 512-
bit cipher Can’t be operated
without it Glasses gentlemen

They don DARK SAFETY GLASSES while Quest keys-in a series

of commands -- the Geodide Ray powering up coolant
pumping its emitter swiveling toward one of the TANKS
A BLINDING BEAM OF ENERGY BLASTS OUT -- a constant stream

that strikes the tank and instantly BURNS A TWO-FOOT
DIAMETER HOLE through its armor and straight out the back

QUEST
Metals Minerals Plastics The
Geodide easily destroys these
But by exploiting a recently
discovered phase difference in the
valence shells of inorganic and
organic compounds Well let me
just show you

Quest steps calmly INTO THE PATH OF THE BEAM

The ENERGY ARCS through his body The buttons BURN off his
shirt His glasses MELT off his face His security tag
turns to STEAM But the rest of him is utterly unscathed

QUEST
Organic matter biological material
-- everything from skin to bone
hair to cotton plants and animals
-- as far as the Geodide Ray is
concerned they simply don’t exist

Quest nods to his assistant who shuts off the beam The
generals and admirals stare stunned by what they’ve seen
QUEST
With this weapon we could destroy
an enemy tank or an entire brigade
-- all without a single casualty
It is the first truly non-lethal --
and truly effective -- weapon of
its kind

The crowd APPLAUDS surging forward to congratulate him
FOUR-STAR GENERAL
Extraordinary Quest Astounding
I don’t know how you do it
QUEST
(checking his buttons)
Well I go through a lot of shirts

The men laugh peppering him with questions and
compliments As Quest tries to answer them all in turn

A FIGURE melts out of the shadows crossing the hangar

We don’t get a good look at him All we see is a FLASH of

MOVEMENT as he slips past Quest’s distracted assistants

making his way to THE GEODIDE RAY There his fingers

fly over its controls and suddenly --

It POWERS UP barrel SWIVELING -- in quick precise

movements -- its BEAM BLASTING OUT sweeping over the heads

of the generals -- who panicked hit the deck

ALARMS WAIL -- GUARDS race from the perimeter --
surrounding the intruder -- SHOUTING -- forcing him down

Quest hurries to cut the ray’s power -- re-locking it with

his code He pushes through the chaos finally coming
within sight of the perpetrator

A twelve-year-old boy

QUEST
Jonny

JONNY
Hi dad

Meet JONNY QUEST A blond-haired hell-raiser His face
pressed to the concrete a rifle barrel digging into his
cheek he somehow manages to seem more cocky than afraid
As Quest stares down at his son we pull back to reveal the
wall behind the generals TWO GIANT LETTERS BURNED into it

“JQ”
EXT TEST HANGAR - DAY
Furious Quest drags Jonny out by his arm

JONNY
It’s not like it was gonna hurt
anybody I just wanted to see what
it could do

QUEST
Where’s your bodyguard He’s
supposed to keep you under control

JONNY
You mean my baby-sitter “Agent
Derek” quit I told him his
eyebrows would grow back but --

QUEST
(wheels on him intense)
Jonny you can’t keep doing this
Acting out like this You’re going
to hurt yourself Or someone else

JONNY
Just ‘cause you spend your life in
a boring-ass lab you don’t want me
doing anything exciting Mom never
used to stifle me Mom --

QUEST
Your mother isn’t here

JONNY
And whose fault is that

Quest is hurt Jonny regrets saying that but it’s not
the kind of thing you can take back Quest ushers his son
toward an army jeep waiting for them and as they’re about
to get inside the SOUND of a HELICOPTER makes them look

The I-1 CHOPPER sets down on the tarmac nearby Roberts
climbs out hurrying toward them Quest recognizes him --

Instantly going alert This has clearly occurred before

ROBERTS
Dr Quest --
QUEST
What’s happened

ROBERTS
We’ve found something We need
you to examine it immediately
It’s already being transferred to
your lab If you’ll come with me

Quest sends Jonny on ahead to the helicopter As the boy
sulks out of earshot

QUEST
I want you to get a message to your
director can you do that Tell
Corvin I need another bodyguard
She’11l know what that means

ROBERTS
A bodyguard Anyone specific

QUEST
I need someone who can handle
anything And I need him now

As they step into the chopper its skids lifting off we
SMASH CUT TO
ROGER ‘RACE’ BANNON

as an UPPERCUT snaps his head back He sits tied toa
chair in a dark dingy windowless room

SUPER SOMEWHERE IN THE UKRAINE

With stark white hair and more scars than skin Race might
not be the youngest agent you’ll meet Just the toughest

RACE
Guys don’t wanna tell you how to
do your jobs but have you ever
heard the expression “you get more
flies with honey --”

A SLEDGE-SIZED FIST slams across his jaw He’s being
interrogated by THREE EASTERN BLOC THUGS We’11 call the
big one SERGEI the giant IVAN and the monster IGOR

RACE
(spits a tooth)
Just trying to help

SERGEI
We know who you are Agent Bannon
It doesn’t matter if you’re CIA
FBI or another of your
government’s ridiculous acronyms

RACE
DMV IHOP

SERGEI
You will tell us everything you
know of our upcoming transaction

RACE
Transaction You mean the two
surplus Soviet warheads you’ re
unloading on the black market Or
do you have a shipment of used
Levis coming in

Ivan HITS him A hammer and sickle blow to the gut
SERGEIL

Do they know where the sale will
take place Do they know when

Igor HITS him Ivan HITS him Igor Ivan Finally fed
up Sergei whips out a handgun jams it to Race’s temple --

RACE
Alright alright You win They
know St Sophia Cathedral in
Kiev Next Tuesday Midnight

Sergei laughs Igor and Ivan join in guttural and phlegmy

SERGEI

And you call yourselves
intelligence agents That’s what
we wanted you to believe The sale
is happening not twenty meters
away As we speak

(leans in close)
Your silly little acronym doesn’t
know that do they

Sergei PISTOL WHIPS him -- Race’s head SNAPS to the side --

And a tiny plastic nub bounces out onto the floor A MICRO-
EARPIECE The thugs look from it to him Race shrugs

RACE
They do now
We can almost see the gears turning as they realize -- this
entire time -- they weren’t interrogating Race He was
interrogating them But by the time they do --

Race has slipped his bonds -- moving like lightning -- and
STRIKING like it too With judo moves and vicious street
boxing he takes the three thugs down Fast brutal easy

Race retrieves his ear-piece from the floor and pops it in

RACE
Rover-one this is Fly Fisher Do
you copy that location Rover-one

STATIC The ear-piece is busted That means it’s up to
him Again Race grabs Sergei’s gun and --

EXT CONTAINER SHIP - NIGHT

-- BURSTS out of a 40-foot CARGO CONTAINER One of dozens
stacked on the deck of a gargantuan container ship at dock

Moving quickly quietly he makes his way through the maze
of containers -- his gun at the ready -- until he comes
across a small circle of light and lying sprawled in it

BODIES More Eastern Bloc bad guys their guns scattered
around them Clearly dead -- but without a mark on them

THE SOUND OF GEARS GRINDING makes Race look up

where the arm of a loading crane swings a LARGE WOODEN
CRATE stenciled with Cyrillic letters toward the railing

He tracks it to the side of the ship where he sees below --

A MINI-SUB

Thirty-feet of black steel bobbing in the water MEN IN
WET-SUITS atop it Guiding the crate in and detaching it

Race INSTANTLY OPENS FIRE --

His shots RICOCHETING around them sending the men
scrambling for cover He has them dead to rights until --

BULLETS riddle his position -- Fired from further down the
ship at the base of the crane Race ducks behind a

container -- As TWO MORE WET-SUITED MEN pin him down with
sub-machine-gun fire He peeks out Far enough to see --

A THIRD WET-SUITED MAN fixing the crane to a SECOND CRATE

As it LIFTS into the air swinging overhead Race DIVES out
from cover -- FIRING at the crane’s cable --

It FRAYS SNAPS --

Sending the crate CRASHING onto the deck The thieves flee
back to the sub -- two of them VAULTING OFF THE SIDE into
the black water below but before the third one clears it --

RACE
HOLD IT

Race’s gun is trained on his back He freezes Hands up

RACE
Turn around NOW
The man TURNS We only catch a glimpse of his face in
the dim light -- scarred severe -- but in Race’s eyes we

see aglimmer of recognition

But before he can be sure -- A BLAST OF LIGHT BLINDS Race
a HELICOPTER soaring in SEARCHLIGHT sweeping He waves it
off but it’s too late The man is gone He runs to the
railing but the sub’s gone too Bubbles in the water
I-1 AGENTS repel down around him Coming to the “rescue”

RACE
Nice timing guys

Pissed he holsters his gun while we move down down
INT BLACK SEA - NIGHT
where the mini-sub knifes through the deep dark water

INSIDE we find the wet-suited thieves gathered around
their crate using crowbars to force it open revealing --

A SOVIET MIRV WARHEAD One of man’s most deadly creations

The thieves stand aside so that their LEADER the man Race
held at gunpoint can kneel before it bowed in prayer

1l we can see from this angle is the back of his head
nd it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen SCARS in

he shape of a starburst mar the crown of his shaved

kull A network of high-tech metallic braces crisscrosses
he skin -- fixed into the flesh with pins and screws --
seemingly acting to hold the shattered bone in one piece

tucto Dp

It looks like the exit-wound of some high-caliber bullet

And as this man rises into the light we see the entry-
wound A craterous SCAR in the center of his forehead
Precisely where the mystical “Third Eye” is believed to
reside This is KORCHEK

He turns toward his wet-suited men Zeroing in on one in
particular visibly shaken by his attention

WET-SUIT
Sir I -- I know we’ve failed you

KORCHEK
What makes you believe that

In Korchek’s hand an AUTO-PISTOL cutting edge in every
way except for its stock -- which is made of gold
ornately carved like the hilt of some ceremonial dagger

WET-SUIT
The -- the second warhead --
KORCHEK
Is inconsequential All I require
is one And the gods -- in their
infinite wisdom -- have seen fit to

provide it We should thank them

Korchek returns his weapon to its holster The man
relaxes until -- from the gun’s ornate stock -- he pulls a
GLEAMING BLADE An ancient Indian KATAR -- a punching
dagger The man gasps as it DRIVES into his chest

KORCHEK
With a sacrifice

Korchek squeezes the handle in a precise way and when he
withdraws the katar its single blade has split in three

The man slumps dead at his feet Korchek turns his ice-
cold eyes toward the next man who hurries to blurt out --

WET-SUIT 2

Sir -- that man -- he came out of
nowhere He wasn’t one of the
Ukrainians

KORCHEK

I know His name is Bannon

As Korchek SLAMS his crate back shut --
EXT CONTAINER SHIP - NIGHT

A HAZMAT TEAM carefully opens the second crate

The ship

has been converted into a crime scene I-1 Agents -- local
cops -- the works Race confers with the HAZMAT LEADER

HAZMAT LEADER
The good news is the radioactive
material hasn’t been compromised
Bad news there is no radioactive
material It’s got the trigger
the implosion charges everything
you need for a nuclear detonation

RACE
Except the nuclear part

HAZMAT LEADER
And our Geigers only register
background levels so -- my guess
Neither weapon ever had a payload
But who’d want a bomb without the
stuff that makes it go boom

Before Race can learn anything else -- an agent waves him
over handing him what looks like a MILITARY-ISSUE iPhone

On its screen CORVIN’S unsmiling face

RACE
Ma’am I can explain --

CORVIN
Explain How you initiated an
illegal operation Allowed
yourself to be captured And lost
a nuclear warhead Is that what
you’re going to explain

RACE
(beat)
Not exactly --

CORVIN
You’re off this Bannon as of now

RACE
You can’t take me off I think I
recognized one of the men involved
I know this sounds crazy but
it was Korchek

CORVIN
Korchek’s dead Like you if
you’ re not on the next flight back
You’ve got a new assignment A
high-priority protection detail

RACE
The president again

CORVIN
Not exactly

CUT TO
EXT FLORIDA KEYS - DAY

The shadow of a HELICOPTER skims across the sparkling blue-
green waters of Florida’s southernmost tip

Race sits beside the pilot chewing Advils Either for his
jet-lag or his recent beating take your pick He peers
out the windows as they descend toward their destination
PALM KEY A tiny island in the middle of nowhere

Pristine white beaches Lush green foliage To the
untrained eye it might look like paradise

Race’s eye however is anything but untrained

EXT HELIPAD - DAY

The chopper touches down just long enough for Race to
disembark Then it lifts off again circling back toward
the mainland The sound of its rotors quickly fading

His gear slung on his back Race takes in his surroundings
No welcoming committee In fact the only sign of life
is the barrel of a ROBOT SENTRY GUN protruding from the
bushes servos whirring as it swivels to aim at him A

dozen other guns cover him from every conceivable angle

RACE
Warm welcome

He starts down a PATH into the trees The robot guns
tracking him every step of the way

EXT LAGOON - DAY

The path ends at a small lagoon fed by a ten foot
waterfall Race regards it confused Where does he go

A VOICE (0OS)
This way Agent Bannon

He looks -- no one’s there Then beneath his feet TWO
PARALLEL LINES OF LIGHTS appear in the sand Outlining a
PATHWAY that leads directly into the lagoon

THE VOICE
Follow the lights please

RACE
You gotta be kidding me

THE VOICE
Follow the lights please

Race dips in a toe The “water” FRITZES as his shoe
touches it then returns to normal A HOLOGRAM

Bewildered he strides into the faux-lagoon following the
lights until he disappears under the surface

INT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY

The first thing Race sees is -- A BLINDING RED LIGHT --
scanning him from head to toe He’s in a metal-panelled
chamber the size of an ATM vestibule ROBOTIC ARMS
telescope out of the walls poking and prodding him with
all manner of scanners sniffers and high-tech gadgets

A mechanized eyeball maps his iris A needle-tipped
tentacle JABS him sampling his DNA A robotic sniffer
gets a little too friendly with his crotch

RACE
Whoa Down boy

Finally the arms retract the light turns GREEN and the
huge metal door before him slides open to REVEAL --

INT QUEST LABS - DAY

A sleek subterranean complex bustling with scientists and
uniformed staff patrolled by a small army of armed guards

LEAD GUARD
You’re cleared to enter sir We
ppreciate your patience

oy

RACE
hat no body cavity search

QUEST (0OS)
Believe me Agent Bannon If you
were hiding something our machines
would know before you did

Benton Quest crosses the massive letter “Q” emblazoned on

the floor

to shake Race’s hand

RACE
Dr Quest I presume

QUEST
Welcome to Palm Key

INT QUEST LABS - HALLWAY - DAY

Quest leads Race down an impossibly long corridor
crosses to and fro with push-carts and clipboards

-- WHOOSH

QUEST
You’ve been briefed on your
assignment here is that correct

RACE
Briefly

QUEST
I ask because I haven’t yet had an
agent last more than a month I
need to know you can handle this

RACE
Due respect doc I’ve protected
two presidents six heads of state
and myself from more than a few
angry ex-girlfriends I can handle
anything you can throw at me

QUEST
I don’t doubt your qualifications
but this particular job can

have its own particular hazards

A JET of FIRE flares up -- behind an

Staff

observation window Inside the lab two scientists are

testing a new FIRE-SUPPRESSION GRENADE

fire and -- POW

It rolls into the
-- Snuffs it with a BLAST of PINK FOAM

QUEST

You know who I am What we do

RACE
I know people say without you --
the things you make -- we’d all be

calling each other comrade With
British accents In Chinese

QUEST
That might be overstating it

RACE
I said people say it I didn’t say
I do No offense I’m sure you
make some amazing gadgets here

A three-foot JANITOR ROBOT whirs past beeping adorably

RACE
But all the gadgets in the world
can’t do what one well-trained man
with a gun can

They round a corner passing a set of STEEL BIO-SAFETY
DOORS marked “RESTRICTED ACCESS” Quest’s private lab An
assistant exits and as the doors SLIDE open and shut --

We glimpse the mysterious flying craft inside behind a
glass observation window surrounded by lab equipment

QUEST
I have matters to attend to so
we’1l have to keep this brief but
-- I agree with you I learned
that lesson the hard way five
years ago When some well-trained
men with guns tried to kill me

RACE
I’m aware of your file Dr Quest

Quest wheels on him intense

QUEST

Then you’re aware that while I
survived my wife did not Those
men -- whoever sent them -- might
still be out there I need
constant vigilant protection I
need a man who will die -- and kill
-- to make sure something like that
never ever happens again

(quieter)
Do you understand me Agent Bannon

RACE
Race

QUEST
Do you understand me Race

RACE
You’ve got nothing to worry about
doc I’11 keep you safe

Quest shakes his head exasperated

QUEST
Not me Jonny

RACE
“Jonny”

INT JONNY’S ROOM - DAY

Decorated with dirty laundry and adolescent angst Jonny
sprawls on his bed playing an eyeball-melting RACING GAME
on his X-Box 360 BANDIT his black and white bulldog

lies curled up beside him Growling at the door where

Quest and Race stand Race does not look thrilled

QUEST
Jonny Can you turn the game off
There’s someone I want you to meet

JONNY
(a brief glance at Race)
Hey There we met

Quest taps a keypad beside the door The game’s power
instantly cuts out Jonny drops the controller annoyed

QUEST
This is Race

JONNY
“Race” Man you must’ve got your
butt kicked constantly

RACE
Cute kid Listen doc

He takes Quest aside out of earshot
RACE
Somebody got their wires crossed
here okay I’m not the guy you
want for this

QUEST
Your room will be right next door
When I can’t be here my son and
his safety will be your

responsibility
RACE
But --
QUEST

(cuts him off)
I understand being here isn’t your
first choice But I need to know
my son is safe I’ve reviewed
every available agent and you’re
the best guarantee our government
can give me Director Corvin has
granted me total authority in this
So as of now like it or not your
job is Jonny Is that clear

RACE
Yes sir

Race isn’t happy but Quest is satisfied He crosses to
Jonny -- playing his game again -- touches his shoulder

QUEST
I’ll see you at dinner alright
Be good Jonny

Jonny just shrugs him off Doesn’t answer Hurt Quest
starts to go then remembers -- to Race --

QUEST
Oh and he’s had a habit of trying
to sneak off the island lately
Don’t let him

Quest leaves Alone now Jonny eyes Race Appraising
JONNY
I give you two weeks before you’re

begging for reassignment

But Race isn’t easily intimidated He GRABS the kid’s
game controller -- RIPS its cord clean out --

RACE
Listen to me you little brat I’m
not here to be your friend or your
baby-sitter I’m not here to help
with your homework or teach you to
ride your bike like a big boy I’m
here to keep you alive That’s it

Race sees the kid clearly taken aback Softens a little
RACE
You do what I say when I say and
we’1l get along just fine Got it
Jonny nods speechless Race marches out The second the
door shuts behind him Jonny’s “fear” evaporates He looks
to his bulldog an evil little smirk on his face
JONNY
What do you think Bandit One
week Tops
EXT PALM KEY - SUNSET
The sun sinks behind the postcard perfect island while
INT RACE’S QUARTERS
Race unpacks his stuff wishing he were anywhere but here
He unloads weapons gear passports currency from a dozen

different countries But nothing personal No mementos
No photos His life fits in one bag and he travels light

His stuff stowed Race sits down on the bed Tries to
relax but can’t He has no off-switch

Instead he sits at the desk where a high-tech TABLET
COMPUTER is built into the wood He logs onto the I-1
database and quickly calls up

A DOSSIER

The face staring back at him is the same face he saw on the
container ship KORCHEK Sans scars but unmistakable

As Race scans -- photos newsclips files -- we get a brief
window into this man’s background “KGB” “BLACK-
OPS” “SHINING PATH” “ALBANIAN NATIONAL ARMY” We

see hijackings in South Africa and Sydney bombings in
Caracas and Cairo arms sales in every nation in the world

He “speaks fourteen languages” Is “expert in all armed

”

and unarmed combat” “Obsessed with ancient history”

And according to this file he’s been DEAD for TEN YEARS

Race stares at him those same eyes from the ship until --
A NOISE snaps him out of his reverie

Race hears FOOT-STEPS in the hall A SHORT FIGURE ina
jacket FLASHES past his open door It’s gotta be Jonny

One day on the job and already hating it Race shuts the
screen and follows

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
Where he finds the kid trying to hide in a shadowy corner
RACE
You think it’s this easy getting
past me Go back to your room
kid and we’1l forget you were ever
this dumb You hear me
He grabs Jonny’s sleeve the jacket sliding off to REVEAL --

A JANITOR ROBOT It takes Race a split-second to realize
this is a trick A split-second too long

A FIRE-SUPPRESSION GRENADE rolls to a stop at his feet --
KAPOW Spot-welds him to the wall with STICKY PINK FOAM

Jonny melts out of shadows behind him Smug
JONNY
I’m supposed to do what you say
right So if you don’t want me to
leave you like this and go meet
girls in Miami just say so

Race tries to speak but the foam is acting like a gag

JONNY
No Thanks “Race” Don’t wait up

He grabs his jacket and dashes down the hall while Race
pissed beyond belief struggles to tear free of the foam

INT ANOTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bandit scampering at his heels Jonny sprints down the
corridor rounds a corner and ducks through a door into --

AN UNDERGROUND MARINA

High-tech nautical vessels bob in their berths As Jonny
hops aboard a next-gen JET-SKI firing it up

Race bursts in behind him picking foam out of his hair
Just in time to see the jet-ski ZOOM BY spraying water

Race hurries to untie an unattended HYDROFOIL ROCKETS
after him Chasing the kid down a concrete exit tunnel

While Bandit dances on the dock yipping as if to say

“Hey You forgot me”
EXT PALM KEY - NIGHT
A CLIFF WALL SLIDES OPEN and Jonny speeds out of the hidden

entrance slaloming through the jagged rocks and reefs that
litter the shallow waters like a minefield

Blasting out behind him Race expertly pilots his
hydrofoil He GUNS the speedboat’s throttle till he pulls
even with Jonny Shouting over the spray

RACE
Cut the engine kid You’re not
going anywhere

JONNY
Watch me Super Nanny

Jonny cuts a tight turn steering toward a rocky peninsula
where -- like a black gaping mouth -- a SEA CAVE looms

Unafraid he speeds inside vanishing into the darkness

RACE
(sighs)
I hate kids

Although it looks like a tight fit Race zooms in after
him The narrow walls STRIPPING both sides of his hull

INT SEA CAVE - NIGHT

Jonny weaves through the darkness his headlights
illuminating the hairpin twists and turns ahead Knife-
like rock-formations jut out from every angle

Chancing a look back he’s shocked to see Race right behind
him scraping the walls with every turn Jonny goes
faster Like some crazy game of chicken

Race doesn’t balk He matches the boy’s speed pursuing
him through the deadly maze Rock walls blurring past

The distance closes It looks like Jonny can’t outrun Race

forever but -- the jet-ski is smaller more maneuverable
Seeing a fork up ahead -- one passage large the other
frighteningly small -- Jonny knows -- this is his chance

He speeds for the smaller side lies flat on his ski and --
by millimeters -- clears the ceiling and vanishes inside

Race has no choice but to veer toward the larger passage

Seeing the hydrofoil turn off Jonny lets out a whoop of
triumph He’s lost this loser just like all the others
He speeds straight ahead toward where the passage opens
back out onto open water --

But just as his jet-ski emerges from the cave --
-- RACE’S HYDROFOIL cuts across his path having circled

around from the other side It BLASTS PAST and as it
does he’s shocked to find --

A MOORING ROPE

tossed around his waist like a LASSO He has two seconds
to realize what it is before -- IT YANKS HIM OFF HIS SEAT
Dragging him behind Race’s boat like an unwilling
waterskier He skips across the water like a thrown stone

Jonny calls out for Race to stop but due to the water he’s
swallowing his cries come out as HIGH-PITCHED GURGLES

Once Race is convinced the kid’s learned his lesson he
lets up on the throttle and hauls the boy -- SPUTTERING and
soaking wet -- into the boat

JONNY
What the hell was That was
child endangerment man

RACE
That was a lesson If it was too
subtle we can always try again

Jonny beaten and knowing it shakes his head “no”

RACE

get you home before your dad misses
you Though I can’t imagine why
JONNY
I don’t wanna go back there I
hate that place

Yeah you only live in paradise

JONNY
More like Alcatraz You know what
it’s like Having zero friends
except your dog I can’t go to the
mall or play sports or -- even go
to school I used to live ina
normal house With a yard anda
basketball hoop and no robot guns
Since mom died dad treats me like
a prisoner for “my own safety”
He just wants to control my life

So take it up with him kid It’s
your dad’s job to care Not mine

As Race fires up the boat turning back toward Palm Key

INT QUEST’S LAB - NIGHT

A THERMITE TORCH flares to life fixed to the end of a

robotic arm -- SPARKS SPRAYING as it begins to cut a two-

foot-diameter hole in the black hull of the alien ship

Quest mans the torch’s controls supported by TWO

ASSISTANTS All wearing high-tech bio-containment suits
Dedicated 02 heads-up displays vocal video recorders

QUEST

(on vocal recorder )
The exterior of the vessel seems to
be comprised of a unique
polycarbonate alloy Approximately
ten meters in length triangular in
shape The interior appears to be
an electromagnetic black box No
readings register at any EM range

The torch finishes its cut Quest nods to his assistants

who move forward to attach magnetic hand-holds

QUEST
We will now -- at 1923 12 seconds
-- commence entry of the vessel to
determine its origin

Carefully they lift the torch-cut circle free Quest

moves forward peering into the DARK OPENING Confused
ASSISTANT
What is it doctor
At the edge of the circular cut -- a thin INSULATED WIRE
dangles out cut in half by the torch Quest carefully
extracts it Holds it up -- his heads-up display ZOOMING
IN to reveal THREE WORDS printed on it “MADE IN TAIWAN”

ASSISTANT 2
That doesn’t make sense The alien
design The outer-orbit
trajectory It’s like someone went
out of their way to make this thing
appear extra-terrestrial

We can almost see the gears turning inside Quest’s head
Thinking it through Coming to an alarming realization

QUEST
Hit the panic button

His assistants balk caught off guard --

QUEST
HIT IT NOW

One of them reaches for the RED EMERGENCY BUTTON on the
wall nearby but before he touches it --

A THIN METAL TENTACLE WHIPS OUT OF THE HOLE SNAPPING
around his throat like a reticulated python CHOKING the
air out of him Its needle-like tip INJECTS him with
something that causes his body to convulse and go limp

Quest leaps into action -- trying to pull his other
assistant to safety -- but the man is frozen with fear as --

A SWARM OF SPINDLY SPIDER-ROBOTS BURSTS OUT OF THE SHIP

Balanced on six of those deadly tentacles their RED EYES
GLOWING malevolently as they scuttle across the lab
Swarming the assistant Overwhelming and injecting him

Quest runs for the exit One of the spiders springs into
the air -- landing between him and the door It seizes
Quest by his throat pinning him against a console its leg
choking him like a garotte-wire His hand flails out

finds the joystick for the thermite-torch Its arm
swivels around -- SLICING the spider’s leg from its body

Pulling it from his throat Quest escapes -- sealing the
glass safety door -- seconds before the spiders reach it

Their legs tapping angrily -- and futilely -- at the glass
He’s now in the observation room -- looking into the lab --

He yanks off his mask crosses to a second PANIC BUTTON and
HITS IT Nothing happens It blinks “PROTOCOL DISABLED”

Quest looks to the observation window -- horrified to see
the spider-bots -- no longer chasing him -- now swarming
over his computer mainframe their wire-thin legs invading
its systems Clicking and whirring as they take control

ON SCREEN he watches every one of the island’s defense
systems shut down One by one Powerless to stop them

This “alien craft” is actually an elaborate TROJAN HORSE

propelled up the lines by high-tech harnesses FIRING --

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Panic in Palm Key Staff and scientists RUN for their
lives The sounds of GUNFIRE echo nearby Quest is here --
the calm center of this storm -- urging his people to

QUEST
Help each other Quickly go go

Seeing two scientists still in one of the labs he pounds
on the observation window Trying to get their attention

QUEST
Get out of there It’s not safe

They turn -- CUT DOWN by a spray of bullets Quest ducks
out of view as FROGMEN swarm inside the lab

Crossing to a corner THEY LOAD SOMETHING THERE inside a
special WATER-TIGHT CRATE Quest can’t see what from his
angle but whatever it is it must be what they came for

CLICK-CLACK A gun COCKS behind him The second squad of
frogmen surrounds him Clearly they came for two things

FROGMAN
(on his radio)
We have the doctor

They seize Quest hauling him to his feet while

BACK IN THE MARINA

Race drags Jonny to another pylon bullets whizzing past
them Two of the Frogman detach from their lines dropping
onto the dock Surrounding them Angling for a shot

They don’t have much time Race has to think quickly

JONNY
What are we gonna do Race Race

RACE
(more to himself than Jonny)
I need a gun

JONNY
Does it matter what kind

He points to a nearby boat where a wicked SPEAR-GUN leans
against the rail Race shrugs That’1l do

THUNK A TWO-FOOT SPEAR hits a frogmen square in his
chest propelling him back off the dock with a SPLASH

Race re-cocks the gun satisfied Jonny hands him a spear

THUNK THUNK Two more spears -- fired as fast as Race
can reload -- PIN a second frogman to the side of a boat
RACE
(to Jonny)

Spear Spear

JONNY
There are no more spears Who told
you to use two on that guy

But before Race can respond -- THUD -- the third frogman
swinging on his line lands on the deck beside them His
gun comes up ready to fire but --

Race BATS it away with the spear-gun knocking both weapons
out of reach

The Frogman pulls a knife -- SLASHES at Race -- Race
catches his wrist -- they struggle over it each man trying
to force the weapon toward the other

Every muscle flexed every tendon screaming Race sees
Jonny just watching like this is some kind of TV show

RACE
Kid His harness His harness is
still attached HIT IT

Realizing what Race means Jonny grabs the guy’s harness
fumbling until he finds the RETRACTION CONTROL HITS IT --

And with a SCREAMING WHIR the line YANKS the frogman off
his feet propelling him UP -- UP -- UP -- until his head
smashes against the rafters with a sickening CRUNCH His
body goes limp Dangling there

JONNY
Wow Probably didn’t think that
was gonna happen when they came up
with their whole grappling hook
plan huh

RACE
Probably not

JONNY
Now what do we do

Grabbing a frogmen’s rifle with one hand Race grabs Jonny
with the other shoving him aboard a nearby boat

RACE
Get below deck Stay put

JONNY
But --

Race silences him with a look But as Race sprints down
the dock back into the complex Jonny follows And
Bandit EMERGING from HIDING in an old dinghy does too

INT QUEST LABS FRONT GATE - NIGHT

The two squads of frogmen have linked back up funneling in
from two different corridors -- Quest and the water-tight
crate in tow They make for the exit BLASTING another
couple guards that ill-advisedly try to block their escape

As they drag Quest toward the door --

JONNY (0OS)
Dad
He turns -- seeing his son at the far end of a hall --
QUEST

NO JONNY KEEP BACK

The Frogmen’s guns swing toward him --

But RACE comes out of nowhere pulling him back around the
corner as BULLETS RAKE the spot where he was just standing

RACE
I told you to stay put

JONNY
They’ve got my dad

Race peeks into the corridor where the frogmen are laying
down FIRE Covering their escape As the last one
disappears through the door --

Race is on his feet his gun in hand right on their heels
EXT BEACH - NIGHT

The Frogmen drag Quest down the sand shove a dive-mask

over his face pulling him and the crate into the churning
waves While Race exchanges FIRE with their rear-guard

Two frogmen fall but the others pick them up These guys
are like ghosts They don’t even leave their dead behind

They melt back beneath the waves taking Quest and the
crate with them

But Race won’t give up that easy He TACKLES the last
frogman Struggling in the surf he yanks off his mask

RACE

Who sent you You hear me Who

took Quest Who’s behind this
The man just smiles at him and shoves a high-tech INHALER
into his mouth A WHOOSH as it discharges his body
convulsing Mouth frothing And as Race watches

his TEETH DISSOLVE in his mouth His fingertips

BLISTER and BURN from the inside out obliterating his
prints In seconds he is dead And unidentifiable

JONNY (OS)
Why did he do that

The boy stands behind Race stunned by what he’s seen

RACE
So we can’t ask him

With a BARK Bandit lopes down from the trees excited to
finally catch up to Jonny but recognizes the boy’s
mood Something’s wrong The bulldog nuzzles his master

Overcome Jonny holds his dog as tight as he can Not
knowing how to comfort the kid Race doesn’t say a word

Uh-oh Race improvises Grips the handle like brass-
knuckles and -- POW Sends the guard sprawling with a HARD
RIGHT HAND As he and the towering hulk square off

The other guard -- a weasly little guy -- pulls out a STUN-
BATON Stalking toward Jonny The kid backs away --

JONNY
Whoa easy can’t we talk about --

-- ELECTRICITY CRACKLES as the baton swipes at him --

Jonny ducks behind the Shiva statue while the guard
flailing the baton gets tangled in its many arms --

SPARKS FLY as the bronze CONDUCTS The baton’s current
shooting along the statue’s arms to SHOCK the guard
senseless He collapses Smoke wafting from his hair

JONNY
Or that’1ll work too

Jonny snatches up the baton AND Race’s dropped gun as --

-- Race SLAMS back against a stone tablet the hulk’s hands
pressing on his windpipe -- the tablet starting to crack

Race fumbles at the huge guard’s face -- trying to get him
to let go In his desperation he grabs a distinctive

CHINESE MEDALLION from around the man’s neck -- yanking the
chain until it SNAPS Still the man won’t let go until --

ZZT Jonny ZAPS him with the shock-baton But instead of
stunning him it only makes the huge man MAD

INT RELIGIOUS RELICS WING - DAY

The door marked “PRIVATE” SMASHES OPEN as Race is THROWN
THROUGH Jonny hurries out after

JONNY
Sorry Sorry Should’ve used this
one instead

He sticks the GUN in Race’s hand just as the guard stalks
out behind them Race FIRES driving him back They run

EXT MUSEUM - DAY

Out the main doors and down the steps Race and Jonny spot
the LOCAL I-1 agents waiting with the Humvees Jonny
starts to SHOUT for them when --

One WHIPS out an UZI OPENS FIRE Race shoves Jonny over
the railing at the side of the steps Vaulting after him --

-- LANDING in a vendor’s FRUIT STAND The man yells
obscenities as Race and Jonny leap to their feet running --

-- into the street Cars -- mopeds -- buses -- WHIZ PAST --

-- Missing them by inches until -- One doesn’t

A SCREAM OF BRAKES A BLUR of YELLOW and GREEN SKIDS to a
STOP -- a few feet too late -- KNOCKING Race on his butt

Luckily what hit him ain’t exactly a Mack Truck It’s an
AUTO-RICKSHAW one of the tiny three-wheeled motorcars
that Indians use as inner-city taxis About half the size
of a Mini Cooper with a Harley Davidson’s engine

Staggering to his feet Race YANKS the driver out and
shoves Jonny in Gravel flies as the little car PEELS OUT

Followed immediately by the THREE HUMVEES the Museum
Guards and Local I-1 Agents piled inside In pursuit

EXT CITY STREETS - DAY
The auto-rickshaw ZIPS through the crowded avenues --

dodging bicycles cars camels -- while Race steers Jonny
holds on for dear life

JONNY
Why’s everybody shooting at us
Those guards the -- the other

agents they were --

RACE
Left behind in case we came
looking In case we got too close

JONNY
Too close to what

RACE
You wanna stop and ask ‘em I can
let you out up here Hold on

WHAM The lead Humvee RAMS them from behind sending the
rickshaw fishtailing Race turns a corner skidding into --

A NARROW ALLEY

The lead Humvee gives chase while the others keep
straight speeding to head them off on the other side

Race zips between the dumpsters while the Humvee blasts
straight through demolishing everything in its path One
of the agents leans out the window -- SPRAYING his UZI

JONNY
Gimmie your gun I’11 shoot back

RACE
Yeah okay You’re twelve

JONNY
And I wanna live to see thirteen
So either let me shoot or --
Jonny flinches as the rear window SHATTERS

JONNY
-- Or you shoot I’11 drive

RACE
Why don’t I just shoot myself

One hand on the wheel Race leans out to FIRE back at the
Humvee But it’s hard to do both and his shots miss wide

Jonny -- seizing the moment -- swings into the front seat
(not big enough for the both of them) and grabs the wheel

RACE
Kid I said no

JONNY
Just for a sec Just so you can
stop missing so bad

Race relents While Jonny takes over the pedals and the
wheel he leans out the side --

Squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS

The Humvee’s windshield spiderwebs The driver slumps
forward and the SUV VEERS SHARPLY TO ONE SIDE -- HITTING A
DUMPSTER LIKE A JUMP -- IT VAULTS INTO THE AIR

TWISTING SPINNING SIDEWAYS its HUGE SHADOW covering the
tiny rickshaw as it TUMBLES down toward them --

-- LURCHING to a SUDDEN METAL SCREECHING STOP WEDGED
between the narrow walls The vehicle suspended there
Stuck Inches above the rickshaw’s flimsy canvas roof

As they zip out from under it unscathed Jonny looks at
Race Mouth agape

RACE
Some of that was luck

They speed out of the end of the alley -- back into the
sunlight -- where

The two remaining Humvees are instantly on their tail
Grills filling the rear window as they zoom up behind

Race retakes the wheel -- steering them onto a four-lane
THOROUGHFARE Packed with traffic -- every driver driving
like they’re in their own personal high-speed pursuit

JONNY
There’s too many cars on this road

RACE
What do I do Honk harder

JONNY
Go off road

Jonny yanks the wheel -- swerving them off -- into --
AN OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE

laying on the horn as they speed between the vendor’s
stalls Shoppers frantically diving out of their way --

RACE
What are you doing

JONNY
Losing them Look

The Humvees skid to a stop outside They can’t follow
But their doors fly open and two agents emerge hauling
two high-tech fold-up VEHICLES out of the back They look
like a cross between a snowboard and a Segway

We’11 call them CUTTERS The agents hop aboard BUZZING at
incredible speed into the market

JONNY
Actually don’t look

Grabbing the wheel back Race pilots them down a narrow
aisle -- crowds parting like the Red Sea -- fruit and
jewelry and chickens flying everywhere

But the cutters are faster More maneuverable They
close the gap in a blink Pulling along either side of the
rickshaw Jonny can only watch as -- three feet to his
left -- the agent aims his UZI

JONNY
Uh Race

RACE
I know I know

he same thing’s happening on his side Both agents raise
heir Uzis at once but before they can pull the trigger --

a4

ace swerves into a SILK STAND -- tearing through the
rightly colored sheets hung like drying laundry One of
he agents -- a sari tangled over his face -- loses control
f his cutter -- careens off into a WIND CHIME SHOP --

odow

Jonny WINCES as we HEAR -- but do not see -- what happens
when you crash face-first through ahundred hanging pieces
of jagged metal shrapnel One cutter down One to go

But the other cutter isn’t so easy to shake The agent
dogs them through a series of twists and turns squeezing
off BURSTS of FIRE that plug holes in the rickshaw’s gas
tank tear up its tires shatter the side-view mirrors --

Still the little car chugs on But it’s clear they can’t
outrun this thing forever Jonny spots something ahead

JONNY
There We’1ll lose him in there

He grabs the wheel swerving them out of the market into --
A CONSTRUCTION SITE

The concrete skeleton of a TWO-STORY BUILDING is being
erected here The top floor is supported by a scaffold of
upright BAMBOO POLES Dozens of them arrayed throughout
the interior propping up the roof

They instantly zip up the steps -- zooming inside -- their
car too big to fit between the poles -- pinballing back and
forth as they go -- toppling the supports like ten-pins --

JONNY
Maybe this was a mistake

RACE
Stop grabbing the wheel

Behind them the cutter expertly slaloms through the
falling poles -- closing on them -- firing off shots --

The more poles fall the more the roof starts to buckle and
tilt -- chunks of cement crumbling down as it destabilizes

JONNY
Race we gotta get outta here I
don’t see an exit
But Race sees a WINDOW The two carpenters that just put
it in run for their lives as the rickshaw BLASTS THROUGH
landing outside -- and as the cutter is about to follow --
One last bamboo pole topples --

BRINGING DOWN THE ENTIRE ROOF Burying him in two tons of
concrete As the dust clears

Jonny and Race see the cutter’s tire roll past On fire

JONNY
You think he’s okay

RACE
No

JONNY
Good

He guns the engine speeding out the far side of the site --

-- where they’ re immediately BROADSIDED BY A SPEEDING
HUMVEE -- driven sideways through a plywood wall into --

INT INDIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

An Indian dancing girl stops mid-hip-shake SCREAMS
Diners run for the exit as Race and Jonny -- dazed --
stumble out of their wrecked auto-rickshaw

JONNY
Are we in a restaurant

RACE
We’re not staying Come on kid

EXT INDIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

Race and Jonny stagger out the front door onto a small cul-
de-sac Deserted aside from LOCALS gathered outside a
SMALL TEMPLE and some YOUNG BEGGAR BOYS plying their trade

But they don’t make it two steps before --

The last Humvee skids to a stop at the end of the street
boxing them in The dirty agents flood out led by the
hulking Museum Guard Race checks his clip It’s EMPTY

JONNY
Race what do we do

RACE
(eyeing the temple)
Pray for a miracle

The assassins stalk closer Race and Jonny back away but
there’s nowhere to go It looks like all is lost when --

JONNY
Cows

Race turns confused as a HERD OF BRAHMAN COWS emerges
from a gate driven out by their owner -- maybe to market
or to graze -- stampeding between them and the assassins

Everyone -- bicyclists pedestrians -- stops for the sacred
cattle letting them pass Everyone except the assassins
They SHOOT at the animals Trying to get them to disperse

The Indians outside the temple are SHOCKED by this
sacrilegious display They SHOUT furiously Even the
beggar boys seem upset And one a ragged street urchin of
twelve years old decides to do something about it

This is HADJI SINGH

HADJI
This way Quickly Come Come

He waves to Race and Jonny With no other options -- and
the assassins distracted by the cattle -- they sprint
across the street -- shots kicking up dust at their feet

They follow him through an archway into --
A HIGH-WALLED COURTYARD Another dead-end
But Hadji pulls a length of ROPE out of his knapsack
tossing it up the wall where it winds around a stone

outcropping seemingly of its own accord In the blink of
an eye he scurries up and vanishes over the high wall

Jonny and Race exchange a look impressed

JONNY
How do we know we can trust him

RACE
We don’t Go

Jonny darts up next Then Race As he scrambles over --

The assassins burst into the courtyard locked and loaded
But it’s empty On the hulking Museum Guard’s face his
eyes burning with rage we’re

EXT KOLKATA - SLUMS - SUNSET

The sun sinks below the skyline Rain patters down as
Hadji leads Race and Jonny through a maze of shacks and
shanties The poorest of India’s poor live here

HADJI
Come This way You will be safe
here

JONNY
(to Race low)
Why’s he helping us You think
he’s working for them

But Race isn’t listening His thoughts elsewhere Hadji
pulls aside a tattered curtain revealing a small doorway

JONNY
You think it’s a trap

INT HADJI’S HOME - DAY

At the sight of the tiny hovel Hadji calls home Jonny
feels awful for even thinking that The place is decorated
with a ratty rug an old stool a small shrine to the god
Ganesh and little else Yet despite his poverty Hadji
welcomes Race and Jonny with warmth As honored guests

HADJI
Please Make yourselves at home
The men who are looking for you
will not find you here Not soon

JONNY
You live here
(realizing how rude that was)
Sorry I didn’t --

HADJI
Do not apologize It isn’t much
no but it keeps out the rain

A leak drizzles on Race’s head

HADJI
Mostly My name is Hadji Singh
You are welcome to any aid I can
provide you

JONNY
I’m Jonny That’s Race You
really saved our butts back there

HADJI
Namaste Jonny Namaste Race It
was my pleasure to help Those
men they seemed quite dangerous

JONNY
So why’d you do it They could’ve
come after you too

HADJI
Karma

(off Jonny’s confused look)
Those men committed a grave sin
against our sacred Brahman They
seemed intent on harming you too

I could not -- in good conscience --
simply stand by and let them

Jonny’s never heard a kid his age talk like that And
certainly not a kid with so little He’s impressed
Shamed And it’s clear that there’s a connection between
these two boys already The beginning of friendship

JONNY
Well thanks

HADJI
You’re welcome Now what more can
I do Is there anything you need

Race finally speaks up emptying the contents of his
satchel onto the floor

RACE
I need light Any tools you have
And whatever aluminum you can find

INT HADJI’S HOME - LATER

By the light of an old lantern all of Race’s electronic
equipment lies spread on the floor -- sat-phone earwig
etc -- in various states of disassembly

Using a butter-knife Race pops a CHIP out of the circuit
board of his palm computer Places it inside a scrap of
aluminum foil several other chips already wrapped inside

He picks up a cast-iron skillet and BASHES the foil flat

RACE
(holding out a hand to Jonny)
Give me your bag

JONNY
Are you kidding I’m not letting
your skillet near my stuff
RACE
We gotta go dark kid GPS
cellular radio we gotta remove
and disable anything that might
transmit our location It’s the
first thing they’1l sweep for

Reluctantly Jonny digs his PSP out of his backpack

JONNY
The picture of that missing
artifact’s on there So don’t --

Race grabs it out of his hand Pops in open

RACE
I’m just removing the transponder
It’1l work but it won’t transmit

JONNY
What does all this have to do with
dad The museum The artifact
When we hook back up with I-1l --

RACE
We’ re not “hooking back up” with
anyone If our local agents are in

on this -- and based on them
shooting at us I’d say that’s a
safe bet -- we can’t be sure the

entire agency isn’t compromised

JONNY
Then we’re gonna have to find my
dad ourselves

RACE
“We”

Jonny isn’t backing down on this

JONNY
If it’s not safe for me at I-1
it’s not safe for me anywhere You
know that The best chance I’ve
got is with you

It clearly pains Race but --
RACE

If there was any other way -- and I
mean any other way

Jonny’s pumped But just then the curtains open and
Hadji returns with a bundle of ratty clothes

HADJI
I was able to find some clothing
It may not be in the best
condition but it will allow you to
blend in while you’re here

He disappears into the tiny bedroom at the back of his hut
The second he’s gone Jonny whispers to Race

JONNY
What about him

RACE
What about him

JONNY
hose guys are still out there
ooking for us Even if we’re gone
efore they find us they’re gonna
ind him What do you think
hey’re gonna do to him when --

tho”

RACE
(cutting him off)
No No way We’re not taking him
with us It’s not safe

JONNY
We can’t just leave him He saved
our lives If I’1ll be safe with
you he’1ll be too

RACE
What makes you think anyone would
ever -- in a million years --
voluntarily go anywhere with you
I’ve known you two days -- I’ve
almost been killed on two
continents

Hadji clears his throat Evidently he’s overheard them

HADJI
You’re trying to find your father
yes He’s in danger Those men
were involved

JONNY
Yes

HADJI
Then fate has put me on your path
for a reason I am meant to help
you It would be sacrilege not to

Jonny looks back at Race See Race does not look happy

JONNY
It’s settled We’re going Now
we just gotta figure out where
we’re going

From of his pocket Race pulls out a chain The same chain
he yanked off the massive Museum Guard dangling with the
CHINESE MEDALLION He tosses it to Jonny

JONNY
What’s this

RACE
Where we’re going

(off their confusion)
It’s a “life-bet”

(off more of their confusion)
It’s a bet you place on yourself
Basically wagering you’ll be alive
one year later to collect You
die they don’t pay And most of
the time they don’t pay

Hadji is shocked something like that even exists
HADJI
What kind of place would accept

such a wager

RACE
It ain’t Disneyland

EXT KOLKATA HARBOR - NIGHT

Race -- disguised in the clothes Hadji found head wrapped
in a turban -- makes his way along the docks

A BARNACLE-CRUSTED SUPPLY SHIP is moored at the end of one
of the piers Race approaches a CHINESE SAILOR standing
beside it reading a comic book Passes him a wad of cash

CHINESE SAILOR
(Cantonese subtitled)
How many

Race looks back at Jonny and Hadji carrying the gear

RACE
(Cantonese subtitled)
One adult Two kids

As the sailor nods and the three start up the gangplank
Race -- his army-issue iPhone in his hand -- hits a few

keys The screen flashes TRANSMISSTON COMPLETE And
Race throws it as far as he can SPLASH

INT INTELLIGENCE ONE - CORVIN’S OFFICE - DAY
Corvin is on the warpath Roberts stands by terrified

CORVIN
An entire field office gets hit
Replaced by assassins Our best
team wiped out Now we’ve lost
two Quests for the price of one
And we can’t find either of them

Roberts nods The door opens the Nerdy Agent entering

ROBERTS
God I hope this is good news

NERDY AGENT
Ma’am we just received a flash
transmission from one of our
listening posts in Nepal On the
encrypted emergency channel

He hands her the print-out She scans --

CORVIN
Bannon’s alive And the kid

ROBERTS
Where are they When are they
coming in
She passes him the print-out As Roberts reads his face
falls He quickly ushers the Nerdy Agent out leaving
Corvin alone to brood After a beat she hears a WHINE
Coming from Bandit his leash tied to the leg of her desk

CORVIN
What do you want you little mutt

Bandit nuzzles her hand Despite herself Corvin softens

CORVIN
I know I want to help them too

Moving away from her and the dog past the busy agents
INT QUEST’S CELL - DAY NIGHT

we find Quest currently trying to help himself He
crouches at his cell door His brow knit in concentration

A food tray lies beside him -- the food untouched -- but
the steel plate the cup the utensils -- they’ve all been
bent broken taken apart to create

TOOLS SPARKS FLASH as he uses his makeshift implements to
short-circuit the electromag-lock It CLICKS open

INT CORRIDOR

Dripping pipes and cracked cement Quest sneaks quietly
down the hall Rounding a corner --

He ducks back barely avoiding being seen by TWO GUARDS
stationed before a huge steel door

Thinking fast he moves to a nearby FUSE BOX -- using his
tools to do some quick rewiring

AROUND THE CORNER a LIGHT BULB -- further down the hall --
suddenly GLOWS BRIGHTER BRIGHTER Too much current
running into it -- until it EXPLODES in a shower of sparks

As the guards go to investigate
Quest slips through the door into --
INT SURD’S LAB

A laboratory to rival even Palm Key Quest moves quickly
to a bank of computers His fingers flying over the keys

He tries to access an outside connection but the screen
FLASHES “ERROR No outside connection available”

The computers are networked but not to the outside world

Quest is about to move on when he notices -- every one of
these workstations is running the same program A BRUTE-
FORCE ENCRYPTION CRACKER columns of numbers spinning like
slot-machine wheels trying to solve a512-bit cipher

Curious he follows their hard-lines to

that same WATER-TIGHT CRATE he saw the frogmen use on
Palm Key It’s open now and inside it

HIS GEODIDE RAY
That’s what they took from Quest’s lab That’s the code

they’re trying to crack Surrounding it he finds ANCIENT
FOSSILS MAPS of South East Asia Old SANSKRIT SCROLLS

Before he can learn anything else -- the lab door opens
It’s SURD Flanked by his guards He POINTS -- SHOUTS --
SURD

Contain him

The guards rush toward Quest who runs through the lab
tables -- pausing to grab -- one two chemical bottles from
the shelves He pours one bottle into the other and --

FOOSH SMOKE ERUPTS OUT -- surrounding engulfing Quest
and the guards -- shrouding them all in a SMOKE SCREEN
In the confusion Quest dashes past them -- past Surd --

INT CORRIDOR

Quest bursts back into the hall -- ALARMS WAILING behind
him he runs -- rounds a corner -- sees ahead -- a LADDER --

Hand over hand on the rusty metal rungs Quest CLIMBS as
fast as he can -- higher -- higher -- chances a look down --

THE GUARDS

are ten yards below breathing heavy as they pursue him
One squeezes off a SHOT -- RICOCHETING off the rung near
Quest’s foot Quest climbs faster -- higher -- until --

He reaches a CATWALK -- high above this dark shadowy
complex Running along it -- he sees ahead -- A DOOR --

Stenciled on it in peeling paint “SALIDA” “EXIT” in
Spanish Below it the translation printed in RUSSIAN

Quest yanks it open -- blinded by the DAYLIGHT -- he runs
through Right the barrel of an AUTO-PISTOL

Aiming it KORCHEK

SMASH CUT TO

QUEST -- thrown back into his cell -- landing hard on the
cement Korchek strides in next with an apologetic Surd

SURD
It was a momentary lapse I assure
you I have him under control

He might be caught but Quest is hardly “under control”

QUEST
Whatever you want with the Geodide
Ray you’ll never get it You can
run your computers a hundred years
you’1l never break the cipher

KORCHEK
(to Surd)
No more half measures doctor
Very soon we will have everything
we need If you can’t break the
cipher break him

Korchek goes Leaving Surd and Quest alone

SURD
I’d hoped it wouldn’t come to this
Benton But you’ve left me little
choice

TWO ASSISTANTS enter dressed in green scrubs wheeling a
nefarious-looking TORTURE MACHINE between them It
protrudes with all manner of blades syringes electrodes

SURD
Now old friend you will either
give me that code

(deadly serious)
Or I will do whatever it takes to
persuade you

As the machine wheels closer its arms WHIRRING to life
EXT SOUTH CHINA SEA - NIGHT

The supply ship motors through ten-foot swells Gripping

SUPER 13 MILES OFF THE COAST OF HONG KONG
JUST INSIDE INTERNATIONAL WATERS

As the ship draws nearer he hears the distant strains of
MUSIC carrying on the wind Music and mayhem

INT OIL RIG - NIGHT

Death-metal echoes Jonny and Hadji stick close to Race
Following him along a dark dank catwalk

Ahead they see a MASSIVE DOOR But the ASIAN BOUNCER
standing next to it is even more massive Seeing Race his
huge face splits into an even huger grin

BOUNCER

railing It lands in the sea below with a SPLASH Jonny
and Hadji exchange looks The Bouncer eyes them
BOUNCER

She already know I’m here
The Bouncer gives him a look -- “What do you think”

RACE
Best not keep her waiting

The massive door creaks open admitting them into

INT THE SEEDIEST BAR ON THE SEVEN SEAS

Crawling with killers thieves pirates and prostitutes
They see faro games Scorpion fights Opium pipes The
lighting’s dark enough to be dangerous The music’s loud

enough to cover a scream

HADJI
My goodness this place is

JONNY
The awesomest place ever

Race drags the kids to a corner sets them down in stools

RACE
I need you two to stay here Don’t
talk to anyone Don’t even make
eye-contact If I’m not back in
ten minutes Well let’s hope
I’m back in ten minutes

JONNY
Who’s this “she” you’re meeting
Is that her

A prostitute draped in an albino python flicks her tongue
at them Race turns Jonny’s head back --

RACE
Stay here and stay outta trouble

Race leaves Near their stools two bad-asses are having a
drinking contest by swigging from a CAN OF GAS One
has one drink too many and VOMITS on a guy lighting a cigar
-- who BURSTS INTO FLAMES

HADJI
(worried)
How precisely

AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE BAR

Race makes his way through the crowd to a secluded corner
cloaked in shadows where A WOMAN sits at a table lit
by candle nubs Pitch black hair and emerald green eyes

One look and you can just tell she knows 99 different ways
to please a man And 999 ways to kill him This is JADE

RACE
(terse)
Look good Jade Been too long

JADE
That’s one opinion Here’s
another the day after the day you
died wouldn’t be “too long”

Even angry she’s nothing short of spectacular She wears
leather and not much of it but the most striking thing
about her is that around her neck she sports not one but
a DOZEN life-bet medallions Clearly Jade is a survivor

JADE
Let’s cut the pleasantries

RACE
Those were pleasantries

JADE
What do you want

BACK AT THE OTHER CORNER --
A ONE-EYED WAITRESS stares down Jonny and Hadji

JONNY
What do you mean you “need to see
our IDs” Have you seen where
you work

She leaves rolling her eye Jonny’s frustrated Hadji
on the other hand is keeping a nervous lookout for Race

HADJI
What do you think is keeping him
Perhaps we should go look

JONNY
No way Every time I don’t stay
where Race tells me to bad stuff
happens This time -- no matter
what -- I am staying right here

A GLEAMING HOOK taps his shoulder Charles Manson’s twin
brother looms over him Teeth filed down to knife-tips

IGHTMARE JOE
You’ re on my stool

BACK WITH RACE AND JADE

The giant guard’s medallion lies on the table before her

JADE

I might know who you’re looking
for Might even be able to take
you to them But there’s something
youre not telling me isn’t there

landing two inches away from the Mike Tyson of arthropods

-- Jonny backs away from the angry gamblers apologizing --

JONNY
I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry

The gun he was holding to his head GOES OFF missing him by
inches The guy stares at Jonny eyes wide

JONNY
I’m sorry

Don’t be

Unfortunately the guy sitting next to him wasn’t so lucky
SMOKE WAFTING from his chest he slumps over Dead

Jonny and Hadji -- stuck in the middle of the chaos they’ve
created -- until TWO HANDS grab them It’s Race

through the waves crisscrossed with old scars and hanging
with frayed sails But inside the ancient exterior --

hodgepodge of the latest black market tech and nav gear
this thing has got it where it counts
Jade steers with expert ease alone at the wheel while

Jonny stares slack-jawed at the tallest filthiest
heap of DIRTY DISHES we’ve ever seen

JONNY
You’ve gotta be kidding me

homemaker ain’t one of them
(rolling up his sleeves)
Come on I’1l wash you two dry
They set to work Jonny very reluctantly
JONNY
What’s the deal with you and her
anyway What is she an old
girlfriend
Race doesn’t answer

JONNY

A dish towel HITS Jonny in the face But Race knows he
isn’t going to get off the hook that easily

RACE
All I’m gonna say is sometimes
love hurts
He shows them an OLD NASTY SCAR at the nape of his neck

RACE
Sometimes love uses a paring knife

Jonny and Hadji exchange a look -- adults are insane --
then quietly awkwardly return to dish drying

Do you know how many dishes I --

Race puts a hand on his chest quieting him

RACE
One last favor Jade Watch these
two while I go ashore

JONNY
What -- no -- you’re not leaving us
here Race I’m going with you --

But Race ignores him still focused on Jade She nods

JADE
I’ve got a bathroom that could use
a little elbow grease

Jonny’s apoplectic -- “Hey Wait Guys” -- but they
ignore him heading up onto deck Jonny looks at Hadji

JONNY
Can you believe this We’ve gotta
stay here With her

HADJI
(deeply smitten)
I know I can’t believe our luck

EXT JADE’S JUNK - ON DECK - NIGHT

Race zips up his wetsuit checking his gear -- dive knife
waterproof holster flares walkie-talkie etc From the
way he works methodically he’s clearly done this before

Jade studies him Clearly she’s done that before too

JADE
I hate to set feminism back fifty
years but be careful alright
If you don’t come back I’m
throwing the Hardy boys overboard

RACE
Just a little moonlit swim Little
walk through the dark scary
jungle What could go wrong

JADE
From what I’ve heard about this
island A lot It’s inhabited

RACE
That’s what I’m counting on

JADE
I don’t mean the men you’re looking
for Roger Just be careful

He will As she sashays back inside he tips back over the
railing and SPLASHES into the water below

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT
Humid ferns and hanging vines sway eerily in the breeze
Race makes his way through the overgrown underbrush quiet

as a ghost Eyes scanning

He spots some TRACKS in the mud Squats to study them

They’ re human but small Barefoot Before he can figure
out what they mean -- a SOUND makes him freeze

A HUM Growing nearer louder rising to a high-pitched
whine then lowering as it retreats Race follows it to

THE EDGE OF A CLEARING

Where Race pushes aside a giant fern to REVEAL --

MEN Two dozen European American it’s tough to tell
Wearing work boots coveralls Some ARMED Patrolling the
perimeter of a BASE CAMP set at the mouth of an OLD MINE
There seems to be activity inside The noise of MACHINERY

Before Race can see anything else -- the HUM -- it returns
Louder Nearer He has just enough time to duck flat as --

A HOVERCRAFT

zooms out of the trees Skimming across the jungle floor
three feet off the ground Sleek fast and maneuverable

This thing’s the cutting edge in next-gen transport Some
kind of anti-grav setup TWO MEN ride inside -- one pilot
one gunner -- anonymous in high-tech night-vision headsets

Race watches the hovercraft disappear into the mine Its
hum dissipating into the darkness He quickly slips away

INT JUNGLE - NIGHT
Away from the camp Race moves fast on his WALKIE-TALKIE

RACE

Twenty to thirty men And that’s
just outside the mine No way to
tell inside Gear guns -- all
cutting edge Next-gen stuff I’ve
never even seen Whoever’s funding
these guys has deep pockets

(STATIC on the walkie)
Jade You get that Do you copy

STATIC answers back Race jiggles the thing peeved
RACE
They get a hovercraft I get this
piece of --

He stops mid-word as a RAZOR-SHARP PIECE OF OBSIDIAN
lashed to a bamboo pole points directly at his crotch

A SPEAR The man holding it is four feet tall and
tattooed A PO-HO One of the island’s natives He

smiles at Race Flanked by ten of his brothers
RACE
-- Crap
Race slowly -- carefully -- puts up his hands

EXT JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT

Chattering in Po-Ho-ese the natives usher Race along a
path through the jungle stripped of his gear -- his knife
his walkie-talkie even his gun One keeps jabbing him
with a spear and Race just smiles back at him Jovial

RACE
Stick me with that thing one more
time little buddy and I’11 stick
it where the sun don’t shine

The native giggles then jabs him again They lead Race
through a grove of banyan trees into

THE PO-HO VILLAGE
A small cluster of thatched huts hung with animal skins

The warriors force Race to his knees before the PO-HO
CHIEF A chubby native with a toothy grin They dump his
gear in the mud between them and Race -- seeing one of his
FLARES roll out of his dive bag -- seizes his chance --

He SNATCHES it holding the flare up as the Po-Ho surround
him shouting excitedly waving their spears

RACE
You see this Yeah You watching

He swipes the flare on the chief’s throne and -- FOOSH --
it BLAZES to life illuminating the village with its glow
He waves it over his head majestically His voice BOOMING

RACE
I AM A GREAT AND POWERFUL GOD I
MAKE FIRE FROM NOTHING IF YOU
DISPLEASE ME I SHALL STRIKE YOU --

The chief pulls a pack of MARLBOROS out of his loincloth
and uses the flare to light one up

He laughs The Po-Ho warriors laugh Even Race laughs

SMASH CUT TO

RACE arms flailing falling through space to land --
SPLASH At the bottom of a TWENTY-FOOT PIT His flare
fizzles out as it sinks into the fetid muck

He’s surprised to see Jonny Hadji and Jade They’ve
been here a while Jonny holds up a dead flare

JONNY
You try the god thing too

INT PIT - LATER
Race and Jade square off in the mud yelling at each other

RACE
I told you to stay on the boat
Not get captured by a bunch of
tattooed Tattoos

JADE
I’m not alone in this pit pal

While they continue fighting Jonny and Hadji are busy
studying the walls Trying to find a way out It’s a
natural pit the walls made of mud and moss-covered stone
Too slick to climb Which Jonny finds out when he tries --

-- SPLASH And lands butt-first back in the muck

JONNY
There’s gotta be a way outta here

He moves along the wall Feeling for hand-holds Trying
to find purchase Hadji watches him until Jonny puts his
weight on a mossy section of wall and --

-- in a blink he abruptly DISAPPEARS

JONNY (0OS)
I think I found something

At the spot where he vanished Hadji finds A BOY-SHAPED
HOLE overgrown with moss A PASSAGE Jonny pops out

JONNY
I think it goes pretty far Come
on it might lead out

HADJI
Should we tell them

But Jonny’s already gone As Hadji ducks in after him

RACE
-- Keep an eye on the kids that’s
all you had to do Now tell me
how hard is that

He notices he and Jade are alone in the pit

JADE
You were saying

INT PIT - PASSAGE - NIGHT

Jonny and Hadji make their way through the narrow
passage which opens into a LARGE CAVE The floor is
covered with heaps of rock and stone the remains of a rock
slide perhaps and fifteen feet up the wall LIGHT FILTERS
IN from an OPENING in the rock -- Away out

Unfortunately there’s no way to reach it Jonny starts
piling rocks trying to make a heap high enough to climb

JONNY
Help me Hadj If we get enough
rocks we can -- UGH -- get outta

here
As Jonny struggles to lift a particularly heavy stone
Hadji -- seeing that no one is watching him -- moves
quickly and quietly to the wall There he CLOSES HIS
EYES Folds his hands His brow knit in TOTAL FOCUS

HADJI
(softly)
Sim

Wind STIRS around him lifting his hair

HADJI
Sim sala

His clothes ruffle in the RISING BREEZE The mud around
his ankles starts to RIPPLE and RETREAT As if by magic

HADJI
Sim sim sala bim

His feet suddenly rise off the ground His body lifted by
some invisible force One foot Two feet His
concentration profound Hadji rises higher Higher

JONNY
You gonna help Hadj Hadji
He turns the heavy stone dropping from his hands as he
sees Hadji -- HOVERING -- fifteen feet in the air

He watches dumb as the Hindu boy grabs hold of the ledge
above and casually pulls himself out

Jonny is blown away Hadji realizes he’s been seen

JONNY
How did you Did you just

RACE (0OS)
How’d he get up there

Race and Jade stand at the mouth of the passage Jonny
sees Hadji’s eyes -- begging him not to tell He doesn’t
understand why but he can tell that this is a secret

JONNY
(covering)
I -- uh -- gave him a boost He’s

a good climber The real question
is how do we get up there

HADJI
I’ve found something that may help

A ROPE UNCOILS from above Again Race Jade impressed

JADE
Where’d he get --

JONNY
Don’t ask Just climb

As she seizes hold of the rope

JONNY the last one up pulls himself onto the ledge
where he moves to join Race Jade and Hadji discovering

This tunnel is reinforced with wooden beams Old push-cart
tracks line the ground A rusty pickaxe lies beside an
ancient lantern The passage has led them INSIDE THE MINE

The light they saw from below isn’t sunlight It’s
coming from further along the tunnel Motioning for them
to be quiet Race leads the way Jade follows

Jonny holds Hadji back a second Just out of earshot
JONNY

How did you do that I’ve never
seen anything like that before

HADJI
I’ve never done anything like that
before I assure you Never that
high My grandfather he was a
kind of priest A guru of Hindu
religion The old ways He could
do astonishing things Impossible
things

JONNY
More impossible than that

HADJI
What talent I have is nothing
compared to him

(MORE)
HADJI (CONTD)
When I was very young and he was
very ill he chose me to pass on
his “secrets” as he called them
At first I could do some rope

tricks that’s it But

after

years of practice Study

Meditation Discipline
(pause)
I can’t explain it but

it’s as if

I could feel my grandfather his
spirit -- his atman -- guiding me
I knew somehow I could do that

(urgently)

But you must not to tell anyone

Jonny I swore to keep

grandfather’s secrets secret

Jonny looks at Hadji like he’s nuts

JONNY

Who’d believe me But

seriously

you have gotta show me how to do

that sometime

HADJI
(small smile)
I shall try

They catch up with Race and Jade -- where the tunnel opens

into another passage

strung with FLUORESCENT LIGHTS

CRATES lie here and there empty but stenciled with logos
identifying them as modern mining equipment

Suddenly

Race pulls the others into a dark alcove as --

A HOVERCRAFT hurtles past

up top

JONNY

a SOUND makes them spin

RACE

They follow it to

This belong to those guys you saw
What do you think they’re
digging for down here

A HIGH-PITCHED HUM

zipping deeper into the mine

Only one way to find out

INT CATHEDRAL CAVERN

The tunnel opens onto a ledge overlooking an enormous
natural cave its ceiling bristling with finespun
stalactites And far below

They see Kleig lights Generators Men and machinery
busily working at the site of an ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG At the
far wall a TOWERING STONE STRUCTURE has been partially
excavated from the rock The entrance to an ancient Hindu
CAVE TEMPLE every inch covered with intricate carvings

The sheer scale is breathtaking But all they can see
from here is the exterior

RACE
Come on Let’s get a closer look

INT DIG SITE - MOMENTS LATER

Using the noise of the generators to cover their approach
Race Jonny Jade and Hadji steal across the cavern floor

Skirting the edge of the light they hide behind a cluster
of stalagmites at the base of the temple

From here they have a much better view An air of
expectation seems to hang over the site The workers seem
to be waiting for something And none of them wants to
wait any closer to the temple than is absolutely necessary

Even the GUARD stationed on its steps seems far more wary
of the temple than anything outside it Which allows Race
to GRAB HIM in a Judo-choke and drag him into the shadows

Armed with his rifle Race ushers the team up the steps --
unseen -- and through the tall forbidding archway into

INT TEMPLE

Hewn in its entirety from the cavern wall the interior of
this sacred structure is dark as a cave and quiet as a
tomb Lights have been set-up to illuminate some of the
intricately carved walls But otherwise it is deserted

JONNY
(hushed)
What is this place A tomb

He strides deeper into the darkness through a curtain of
cobwebs to find --

A VISION OF HORROR

A GROTESQUE MAN with four arms and four heads his fingers
grasping His mouths twisted in SILENT SCREAMS

Jonny almost jumps out of his skin until he realizes it’s
a RELIEF carved into the stone wall He’s stumbled into

HALL OF LOST SOULS

A twisting shadowy passage Every inch of its walls
floor and ceiling covered with reliefs depicting HUNDREDS
of these FIGURES Their bodies intertwined like some
macabre version of the Kama Sutra Faces frozen in agony
and ecstacy Eerie in the flickering fluorescent lights

JADE
What are they

Race Jonny they don’t know But Hadji does Unnerved

HADJI
Rakshasas Demons born from the
foot of the god Brahma They’re
used for protection

RACE
From what

HADJI
From death But I’ve never seen
so many in one place before

Jade and Race don’t seem concerned but based on what he’s
witnessed recently Jonny isn’t taking this religious stuff
lightly anymore He keeps a close eye on these stone
demons as they squeeze past emerging into

THE SANCTUM SANCTORU

The temple’s inner-most chamber A cavernous vault Its
walls covered with intricate carvings draped in cobwebs

To their left and right TWO TOWERING STONE STATUES -- or
murtis -- flank the entrance Representations of the gods
Shiva and Vishnu And in the center sits an equally

massive statue of the GOD BRAHMA made entirely from GOLD

His four hands presented before him hold three different
objects a silver lotus flower A jeweled scepter Anda
single wooden arrow His last hand is empty

Jonny curious reaches out toward the arrow but --

HADJI
DON’ T TOUCH THAT

Jonny yanks his hand back like he almost touched hot lava
Hadji embarrassed by his own outburst tries to explain

HADJI
You were right Jonny I didn’t
recognize it at first but This

is a tomb A tomb for anyone who
sets foot inside it Look look --

He leads them to the wall tearing down some of the cobwebs
so they can see the carvings The GODS giant and aloof
stand surrounded by SMALLER FIGURES gathered at their feet

HADJI
The Vedas -- our oldest and most
sacred texts -- state that long
ago the gods the three trimuti
used to involve themselves in man’s
affairs They taught him their
worship Their secrets They gave
him gifts And the most prized of
these were their weapons

In the next carving a god passes a BOW and ARROW to a TINY
MAN The same god as the golden statue BRAHMA

HADJI
Most powerful of all was the weapon
created and bestowed by Brahma
(a whisper)
The Brahmastra

The curve of the bow in the carving is identical to the
curve of the piece of artifact stolen from the museum in
Kolkata Realizing this Jonny pulls out his tricked-out
PSP calling up the image It’s an exact match

JONNY
That’s the same shape as the piece
of artifact they took from the
museum It’s a bow

HADJI
The Vedas speak of the weapon as
appearing in that form But this
is no ordinary bow and arrow

In the next carving the man is shown wielding the bow
firing its arrow into the heavens It arcs like LIGHTNING

HADJI
It was a weapon of immense and
terrible power It is said the
Brahmastra was used only once And
where it struck there survived no
plant No animal No man It
blackened the sky Boiled the
oceans Plunged the world into
thirty years of famine

RACE
Every culture has made-up hocus-
pocus crap like that Dragons
Mummies Magic swords What makes
this any different

Hadji pulls down the last of the webs to reveal a startling
image carved thousands of years ago but still
unmistakable AN ANCIENT DEPICTION OF A NUCLEAR DETONATION

The distinctive mushroom-shaped cloud of smoke rising And
beneath it nothing but destruction Devastation Death

HADJI

It is written that “Where the
Brahmastra struck light shown
like lightning Brighter than a
thousand suns shining together

And from it there arose a majestic
cloud of light and dust So big it
reached to the sun and shadowed it
And where it passed everything was
destroyed and nothing survived”

JONNY
It’s like some kinda ancient nuke

HADJI
More destructive than all our
nuclear weapons put together And
after being used only once it was
hidden away Somewhere no one
would ever find it To ensure it
would never be used again

JADE
You’re saying this is it This is
where that weapon was hidden

HADJI
(pleading)
We must leave at once

Suddenly SHADOWS flicker from the entrance VOICES Race
ushers the others behind Shiva’s statue hiding there as --

WORKERS enter ARMED GUARDS and striding among them

A MAN His presence instantly inspiring deference --
or more accurately judging from the look on the work
crew’s faces -- fear Wearing ceremonial robes his head
hooded he carries a LENGTH of PETRIFIED WOOD identical in
shape to the artifact piece taken from the Indian museum

THE BOW OF BRAHMA

As they watch this man -- his face still hidden --
approaches the golden idol Kneels before it The bow
held before him -- like an offering We hear him CHANTING
something in Hindi but we can’t make out the words

JONNY
(whispers)
What’s he doing

HADJI
Some sort of ritual I’ve never
seen it performed before

SHH Race motions for them to be quiet as

The Man rises Steps forward -- every step precise -- and
places the bow in Brahma’s outstretched palm

The moment he does the god’s hand lowers -- like a

mechanical lever clicking into place -- and a RUMBLE SHAKES
THE CHAMBER -- AN EARTHQUAKE -- The golden statue starts to
shake -- to shiver -- as if it’s coming apart at the seams

ITS GIANT HEAD tilts topples off its shoulders -- landing
with a BRUTAL CRUNCH on one of the workers He has just
enough time to SCREAM -- before he’s buried underneath it

Brahma’s arms -- his torso -- before our eyes the idol
begins to crumble -- huge chunks of gold raining down --

And through it all The Man doesn’t move an inch Until

All that remains where the gold idol once stood is a simple

CLAY URN The Man carefully -- reverently -- retrieves it
He sets it -- gently -- in a special GYRO-STABILIZED CRATE
JONNY

What is it A jar

But Race isn’t listening He’s focused instead on the
man as -- for the first time he turns

Revealing his unmistakable Third-Eye scar
JADE
(disbelief)
Korchek

She recognizes him too And for the first time we see
her afraid Jonny tries to get a better look at him but --

JONNY
Who’s Korchek

Race YANKS him back down

RACE
A good reason to not get caught

Taken aback by his intensity the boy nods
RACE
We’re leaving Now I-1 has to be
warned Jade you take point
Hadji you follow Jonny you --

He stops seeing something behind Jonny a tiny chunk of
rock teetering on the statue’s base just about to fall

RACE
Don’t move

JONNY
I’m not --

He accidentally bumps the tiny crumb of rock it falls
Landing with a PLINK on the stone floor
BULLETS STRAFE THETR POSITION Blasting chunks of stone

shrapnel off Shiva’s statue At the center of the chamber
Korchek has his ornate auto-pistol out FIRING IT EMPTY

Race FIRES BACK -- drags Jonny to his feet and all of them
flee for the entrance We hear Korchek shouting the alarm
sounding men running guns cocking In short CHAOS

INT CATHEDRAL CAVERN - DAY
Race Jade Hadji and Jonny run for their lives Bursting

out of the temple Race lays down a spray of cover fire
with the guard’s machine gun

Workers scramble for safety guards go for their weapons --

RACE
Go go I’1l cover you

He BLASTS a bank of generators plunging the cave into
PITCH BLACKNESS broken only by the staccato MUZZLE FLASHES
of the running fire fight

Jade leads Jonny and Hadji across the site -- stalagmites
EXPLODING around them -- Race behind -- urging them into --

MINE TUNNEL

They dash down the corridor -- Race’s shots forcing the
guards to fall back It looks like they might actually
make it out of this alive when --

JADE
Look out

-- A HOVERCRAFT ROCKETS out of a side tunnel The pilot
veering toward them The gunner’s machine-gun coming up --

Race and Jade tackle Jonny and Hadji flat as bullets RAKE
the dirt -- the hovercraft screaming past overhead --
missing them by a matter of inches

The pilot pivots his craft hurtling back for another pass

The group scrambles to their feet fleeing down the tunnel

JONNY
Race What do we do

H

he craft closes -- the gunner FIRES -- rocks exploding --

JONNY
RACE

RACE
(snaps)
I’m thinking

They round the next bend momentarily safe from the gunner
but the whine grows LOUDER -- LOUDER -- as the craft nears

Race scans for something to save them
Suddenly inspiration

The hover-pilot banks his craft around the bend zooming --

-- right into the FLAT of a SHOVEL SWUNG like a baseball
bat SMACKING him in the face He topples off the back --

the craft -- pilotless -- veers down digging its nose into
the dirt and LURCHING to a stop -- catapulting the gunner
out of his seat -- THUD -- face first into a wooden post

Race tosses down the shovel and strides over to the empty
vehicle Jonny looks amazed

JONNY
Good thinking

The HUM of approaching hovercraft FILLS the tunnel
Rounding the bend Three of them Their guns BLAZING

RACE
Get in

As Race mans the controls and the hovercraft shakily
starts to lift off

INT MINE TUNNEL - DAY

We’ re BLASTING through the mines rock walls BLURRING past
at incredible speed This is our Hover Chase ladies and
gentlemen and if there was ever a time to push IMAX 3D to
its absolute friggin’ limit this is it

Race pilots the craft for all it’s worth The rest of the
team hanging on for dear life Buffeted by screaming wind

JONNY
How do we get outta here

RACE
I dunno it’s a mine Up

The THREE HOVERCRAFT speed behind them their gunners
FIRING BLASTING holes in the hull inches from Hadji

HADJI
Wherever we’re going may we go
faster Please

The tunnel suddenly jogs left -- right -- left again
Race swerves with it but so do their pursuers He just
can’t seem to shake ‘em

RACE
Jade Wanna get these guys off me

CA-CHUK She pops up with the fallen gunner’s RIFLE

JADE
Well if you can’t handle it

She OPENS FIRE on their pursuers ripping HOLES across the
lead craft’s nose It swerves to one side smoke
billowing Veers into another tunnel and disappears

The other two fall back slightly just out of Jade’s range

Ahead the tunnel curves into a HAIRPIN TURN Race turns
with it -- a little late -- Jonny’s side scraping the stone
wall -- SPRAYING SPARKS and SHARDS of rock and metal

RACE
Watch your fingers

JONNY
Watch where you’re going

RACE
I am watching where I’m -- Uh-oh

Appearing in their headlights -- and on them in a blink --

A COLLAPSED BEAM lies across the passage at a 45 degree
angle Race PULLS UP HARD threading their craft through
the small clearance space above it --

The instant they’re through ANOTHER BEAM LOOMS at another
angle -- this whole section is collapsed Strewn with
rocks and leaning beams

Race DIVES under this one -- almost taking off their heads

Up Down To one side To the other The beams keep
coming and Race keeps threading the needle He’s almost
getting cocky until he sees something up ahead that
makes his face go as white as his hair

TWO BEAMS CRISSCROSS THE PASSAGE blocking their way like a
GIANT “X” No time to stop

RACE
Everybody hold on
Jonny Jade hold onto anything that’s bolted down -- Hadji
holds onto Jade -- Race sends them into a ROLL aiming for

a spot that looks too small

And is Their undercarriage GLANCES OFF the beam
obliterating the wood rocking everybody -- struggling to
ride it out -- and when the debris clears --

They’re THROUGH Alive Intact But Race is gone
HIS SEAT EMPTY

Jonny leaps to grab the controls -- keeping them from
veering into the wall -- Jade and Hadji look back but all
they see is dust settling over a heap of broken beams
swiftly receding behind them No sign of Race Bannon

JADE
Race

As their hovercraft disappears around the next bend

One of the heavy beams STIRS A HAND fumbles out
Battered and bruised Race struggles to pull himself free
He’s still gathering his senses when --

THE TWO PURSUIT CRAFT
zoom past -- almost taking his head off

Spotting him one of the pilots slows and cuts a turn
while the other continues after Jonny Jade and Hadji

Race climbs to his feet No gun knowing he can’t outrun
them he’s at least gonna go down standing Across the
long dark tunnel he sees the gunner draw a bead on him --

-- But the pilot shoves the man’s gun up causing it to
DISCHARGE into the ceiling The pilot removes his high-
tech headset revealing the Giant Guard from Kolkata his
face still bearing the evidence of his run-in with Race

A bruise in the shape of a sword handle

He GUNS the hovercraft’s engine speeding towards Race who
stands there like a matador facing down a bull -- while

BACK WITH THE OTHERS

Tracer rounds buzz past the speeding hovercraft like
burning bees Jonny white-knuckles the controls steering
through a slalom of outcropping rocks

JADE
You sure this is a good idea You
driving

She’s busy herself exchanging FIRE with Korchek’s men the
last craft twenty yards back and gaining fast

JONNY
Don’t worry about it Race lets me
drive all the time I got this
(to himself)
I hope

JADE
What

JONNY
Nothing Just keep shooting
(to Hadji)
See if you can figure out where we
are Hadj We gotta circle back
for Race

Hadji has Jonny’s PSP -- hooked up to the hovercraft’s
computer A complex MINE BLUEPRINT on screen

HADJI
I’m still learning to use this
How do we know if Race is even
still alive

JONNY
We don’t But he’d go back for us

Suddenly ahead -- HEADLIGHTS -- far down the tunnel The
missing third hovercraft Screaming straight towards them

JONNY
This is bad This is really --

BACK WITH RACE

RACE
-- really bad

The hovercraft hurtles toward him Fifty feet Twenty
Ten Race doesn’t move an inch as it BLASTS RIGHT OVER
HIM Plowing him underneath its grill

The Guard laughs His gunner laughs Even Race laughs --

-- Surprising them as he swings up from where he’s been
clinging to the undercarriage -- landing a HAYMAKER to the
Big Guard’s jaw Sending him tumbling out of his seat

Race and the Gunner wrestle over the controls the craft
ricocheting off the rock walls like a pinball -- while --

JONNY HADJI AND JADE

race toward a head-on collision The other craft’s right
behind them Boxing them in Bullets crisscrossing from
front and rear There are no turns No ways out They

are going to HIT HEAD-FIRST if they don’t act RIGHT NOW

HADJI
Up Jonny Up
JONNY
What do you --

He shoves the PSP-MAP in his face jabbing with his finger

HADJI
This is the tunnel This is us
See Now PULL UP
Jonny does -- the g-force pinning him in his seat as their
hovercraft ROCKETS INTO A CLIMB -- missing the oncoming
craft by inches -- BURSTING through the boarded-up opening

of a HIDDEN MINE SHAFT Directly overhead
INSIDE THE SHAFT

The hovercraft goes vertical the speed astonishing

everyone desperately trying to hang on Beneath them the
two pursuit craft COLLIDE -- EXPLODING into FLAMES
JONNY

This is the greatest moment

of my life
RACE HOWEVER
couldn’t disagree more He’s fighting for his life the
Gunner trying to drive a thumb into his eye Finally Race

jams an elbow in his throat
painfully -- off the back

Too late
until it digs into the dirt

The craft clips the wall

sending him tumbling --
Race regains the controls --

spinning like a top
grinding to a dizzying stop

Thrilled to be on solid ground again
when --

Race staggers out
He’s just getting his bearings

The Giant Guard TACKLES HIM -- the two of them rolling
across the dirt floor -- into

AN OLD FREIGHT ELEVATOR
A steel cage used to transport mining gear up and down

Race SLAMS back against the controls -- the lift lurching
into motion rusty gears grinding as it starts to RISE

TWO PICKAXES SLICE through the air -- the guard wielding
one in each hand -- Race ducking dodging -- barely
avoiding the whizzing steel As one slashes his shirt --

RACE grabs the roof of the cage -- SWINGS -- his BOOTS
PILEDRIVING the big man’s chest -- knocking him back into --

A DUSTY OLD BOX labeled “TNT” which topples

spilling sticks of DYNAMITE across the floor

At the same time one of the pickaxes flies out of his
hand bouncing into the GEARBOX at the side of the elevator
-- its metal pick getting wedged in the gears -- A SHOWER
of SPARKS SPRAYING from the metal on metal grinding

Onto the TNT Instantly A DOZEN FUSES FLASH TO LIFE

Race and the Guard look at each other A beat

They both SCRAMBLE out the cage door -- SCURRYING up the
sides -- trying to reach the cable above and climb to
safety before the dynamite burns down and goes boom

The Big Man makes it first -- kicking Race back -- then
SWINGING the other pickaxe -- WAILING on the BRACKET that
connects the steel cable to the elevator

The bracket starts to give metal SHEARING
The Guard grabs hold of the cable -- grinning victoriously
at Race as -- the bracket RIPS free of its housing --

-- Only now realizing that in the excitement his boot has
gotten WEDGED in the cage roof Stuck there The cable
breaks free and for one brief moment the massive Guard is
still holding onto it -- tethering it to the heavy cage

And that’s all the time Race needs to SCRAMBLE up his body
and SEIZE hold of the cable

Before it YANKS out of the guard’s hands and he -- and the
cage -- and the TNT -- plummet into the darkness

As the counterweight drops and Race ROCKETS up up up --

A titanic EXPLOSION ignites far below

INT MINE TUNNEL - DAY

Somehow someway Race pulls himself to safety at the top
of the shaft Way way way beyond exhausted

So much so that he barely reacts when he sees ANOTHER
HOVERCRAFT barreling toward him Luckily -- he recognizes

the pilots Jonny Hadji And Jade

JONNY

Race We been looking everywhere

for you Where’ve you been

RACE
I took the elevator

Jonny and Hadji hop out helping him up

In the tunnel ahead they can see LIGHT DAYLIGHT They
are almost there But before they can make it --

LASER SIGHTS crisscross the dusty air as F
MEN flood into the tunnel Cutting off all

FTY of KORCHEK’S
l hope of escape

They’ re cornered Weaponless But Race Jonny even
Hadji they’re not going down without a fight This is it
The last stand But before the bullets start flying

A SQUEAL of STATIC breaks the silence They turn to see

Jade holding the hovercraft RADIO Her gun aimed at them

JADE
(into radio)

Korchek This is Jade Tell your

men to stand down I have a
proposition for you

Race meets her gaze He knows what she’s doing Her

finger tightens on her trigger

JADE
Don’t make me Roger
(into radio)
You let me walk out of here I
give you Bannon and the two boys
Alive and intact

JONNY
Jade what are you doing

JADE
Surviving

For a moment her eyes seem to apologize
moment Then her radio SQUAWKS and we --

But only for a

SMASH CUT TO

A GUT KICK Drives Race to his knees Hands force Jonny
and Hadji down beside him gun barrels digging into their
backs The men stand aside as Korchek strides in doffing
his ceremonial robes His camouflage fatigues underneath

He looks to Jade -- still armed -- her insurance -- eyeing
his men like a fox eyeing a pack of hunting dogs

KORCHEK
You can put that away I may not
be a man of my word but if I want
you dead that won’t dissuade me

Can’t argue with that She lowers it

KORCHEK
You’ll be escorted back to your
boat Once you’re clear of the
island you’ll forget you were ever
here Do that and I will too

Jade nods toward Race

JADE
Can I give him something first

KORCHEK
A farewell kiss

She kneels before Race grabs a fistful of his hair leans
in close and -- JAMS HER BOWIE KNIFE into his shoulder --

JADE
Something to remember me by

She TWISTS it Yanks it out And then She’s gone
Marching off into the light flanked by a pair of Korchek’s
guards Korchek watches her Wistful

KORCHEK
Magnificent woman I can’t imagine
what she sees in you

RACE
(wincing)
A pin-cushion apparently

Korchek laughs Sounds like something he doesn’t do often

KORCHEK
It’s good to see you Race I
hadn’t heard you’d given up wet-
work to become a wet-nurse

RACE
I hadn’t heard you were still
alive Korchek

KORCHEK
(fingering his scar)
Yes well the gods it seems
still have plans for me You must
be disappointed

RACE
Actually I’m thrilled Now I get
to kill you twice

One of the guards moves to bash Race with his rifle butt
but Korchek stops him Squats before Race

KORCHEK
I don’t hate you Race Do you
know that What you did to me
it set me free You’re the reason
I’ve become the man you see before
you Reborn Chosen An
instrument of the divine

RACE
(Re his forehead)
You know you got a little
something right here

Korchek smiles disappointed as -- he yanks his katar out
of its gun-handle sheath Its three blades springing open

KORCHEK
Shall we finish what she started
JONNY
Leave him alone
His gaze shifts to Jonny trying so hard to look tough
RACE

Kid don’t help
But Korchek’s already moving toward the boy

KORCHEK
And this must be young Jonny You
know it’s rude to interrupt when
grownups are talking Didn’t your
mother teach you any manners

JONNY
(ice)
Don’t talk about my mother

KORCHEK
You know how they say “Oh she’s
in a better place now” It isn’t
true I’ve been there I know
And so -- very soon -- will you

And your friends And your father
Enraged Jonny LAUNCHES himself at Korchek but --
In one effortless motion -- the man grabs the boy and
HEAVES him against the nearest wall like a sack of
potatoes Jonny SLAMS into the rock -- CRASHING onto his
back GASPING for air the wind knocked out of him

Restrained by the guards there’s nothing Race can do

KORCHEK
Bring the boy Throw Bannon and
the Hindu down a mine shaft

Korchek starts to leave but

RACE
Tell me one thing before you go
Korchek You don’t seriously
believe that antique cookie jar is
some “weapon of the gods” do you
Tell me you’re not that dumb

Korchek stops Takes the bait

KORCHEK
I believe the world is full of
things mindless thugs like you
can’t begin to understand

RACE
So explain it to me Speak slow
Your “spiritual reawakening” -- it

might have your men fooled but I

know you You don’t take a piss

unless you see a profit in it
(quiet just for Korchek)

Level with me Call it a last

request What’s this really about

Korchek leans in close Just for Race

KORCHEK
The world pays a fortune for
weapons made by men Imagine what
they’1l1 pay for one made by a god

A beat Race BURSTS OUT LAUGHING -- right in his face

RACE
You believe that I got a bridge to
sell you In Candy-Land

-- A RIFLE-BUTT KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD

Korchek looks down at him red-faced He doesn’t like
being made a fool of He decides --

KORCHEK
Bring them All of them

As his men haul Jonny Hadji and unconscious Race away
INT CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Race SNAPS AWAKE finding himself sprawled on the hard deck
of a moving ship His head hurts his shoulder really
hurts and he’s handcuffed to a pipe beside Jonny and Hadji

RACE
Tell me this is a hang-over
(sighs)
Are we on a boat To where

HADJI
We’ve been locked in here since
they brought us on board But we
did hear them say one thing

JONNY
Cuba

Race’s face darkens That is not good news

JONNY
Who is he Race “Korchek”

RACE
Ex-black ops for the other team
Arms dealer Terrorist for hire
Your basic bad-guy-of-all-trades
But everyone thought he was dead
Especially me

HADJI
You did that to him His scar

Race nods

JONNY
You should’ve used two bullets
RACE
It’s a mistake I won’t make twice
Silence until -- Jonny asks what’s really on his mind
JONNY
Korchek -- that weapon -- what’s

all this have to do with my dad

Race doesn’t know And as they huddle there alone we
DISSOLVE TO

EXT COAST - NIGHT
An uninhabited peninsula overgrown with banana trees
SUPER CUBA
And beneath the ground
INT KORCHEK’S COMPOUND

Which we now discover is inside an old abandoned SOVIET
MISSILE SILO We move down the dark dank corridor to

QUEST’S CELL

Where Quest shields his eyes as the door opens Face
sallow Eyes sunken He’s been through hell in the last
few days Surd wheels in followed by his assistants

SURD
You’ve been surprisingly resilient
Benton Most men would’ve broken
under far less duress

QUEST
(hoarse)
You can do what you want to me
Jeremiah Kill me I don’t care
I will never give you the code

SURD
Never say never old friend

The assistants drag Quest out the door where he sees
INT CORRIDOR

JONNY led in by Korchek’s men his wrists bound in high-
tech handcuffs

QUEST
Jonny

JONNY
Dad

The boy’s face lights up Quest tries to go to him but
his legs are too weak He stumbles -- Falls

JONNY
Dad Let me go Let me help him

Coming down the hall behind with Race and Hadji in tow is
Korchek He nods to his men They release Jonny The boy
sprints to his father’s side Kneels beside him
Expecting to see joy in his father’s eyes Love
Something Instead all he sees is anger RAGE

QUEST
How could you do this Jonny
Put yourself in danger like this
What were you thinking

JONNY
(taken aback)
I was -- we were just --

Quest wheels on Race too

QUEST
How could you let him

Race gives no answer Has none
Surd wheels closer looming over Jonny and his father

SURD
Your father’s worried Jonny
That’s all He’s afraid what
happened to your mother might
happen to you No one wants that

Quest looks to Surd He will do whatever they want

JONNY
Dad what’s he talking about
What’s this have to do with mom

But Benton doesn’t answer He can’t bring himself to He
lets the guards haul him to his feet marching him and the
others down the corridor --

INT SURD’S LABORATORY - DAY

Surd’s assistants swarm everywhere Preparing for the
arrival of Korchek’s men -- entering with the gyro-
stabilized crate Surd leads Quest and the others through
the chaos Korchek stalks behind The silent partner

SURD
If he won’t tell you Jonny I
will You deserve to know the
truth Twenty years ago your
father and I were colleagues
Spearheading our country’s research
in weapons of mass destruction

As he speaks his safety-suited assistants move in
carefully un-clamping the locks that seal the crate shut

SURD
We were tasked with identifying any
and all potential threats We
studied cutting edge weaponry
natural viruses even the occult
And it was that which led us to the
legend of the Brahmastra

Lifting off the lid the assistants withdraw the clay urn
holding it like it’s made of uranium

SURD
The weapon of the gods The
ultimate WMD

The assistants hand the urn -- intricately carved -- to
Surd He carries it in his lap wheels across the lab

SURD
Yet where your father saw only its
terrible potential for destruction
I saw something else Possibility

he sets the urn into a high-tech cradle His
assistants activate an array of LASER-CUTTERS -- whirling
around the urn -- shaving off the clay

SURD
Think of it A weapon of such
magnitude if it could be harnessed
-- the way we’ve harnessed the
atomic bomb -- it could provide the
world with almost limitless power

As the clay is removed -- millimeter by millimeter -- it
reveals something within hidden in a cloud of shavings

SURD
Free energy No more blood spilt
for oil It would change the
world Usher in a golden age Man
would be limited only by his
imagination

JONNY
What’s that have to do with my mom

SURD
Patience my boy Something I’ve
learned a great deal about over the
past two decades

The laser-cutters power down what’s left of the urn still
covered in clay shavings Assistants move in using tiny
brushes to delicately remove the debris

SURD
Your father and I found evidence
this weapon existed Clues
pointing to a location where the
last living thing touched by
Brahma’s arrow was secreted away
Hidden in a simple clay urn

inside A FOSSILIZED LOTUS FLOWER Frozen in time
locked in lifeless grey stone Delicate and beautiful

Surd gently retrieves it Holds it like the Holy Grail

SURD
Yet the brilliant Benton Quest
didn’t believe in my vision He
had our project shut down

QUEST
What I believed is what I still
believe Something so powerful can
never be controlled Harnessed
It’s hubris -- madness to even try

RACE
This guy’s playing pet scientist
for Frankenstein’s monster You
think he’s sane

SURD
(snaps)
The difference between madness and
genius is measured only by success

He regains his composure carrying the lotus flower -- his
eyes fixed on it -- to a HIGH-TECH MICROSCOPE SET-UP As
he sets the fossil in place a SUPER-MAGNIFIED VIEW of it
appears on the monitors above Its cells Its structure

SURD
Jonny Do you know what happens to
living things -- to biological
matter -- after thousands of years
JONNY

They fossilize

SURD
Precisely Metals minerals over
time they become indivisible parts
of the cellular structure If the
secrets of this Brahmastra were
locked inside a biological
organism the only way to free them
would be to reverse this process

ON SCREEN the sharp crystalline structure of rock and
metal intertwined with more spherical biological cells

SURD
A problem -- I admit -- I could not
solve Fortunately your father --
unwittingly -- has

His assistants wheel THE GEODIDE RAY into view

SURD
Which brings us to your mother
Jonny I knew your father was
developing his Geodide technology

and -- five years ago -- I -- we --
regrettably grew impatient
Jonny looks to his father -- confused -- “Is he saying what

I think he’s saying” Benton can’t even meet his eyes

SURD
You must believe me We only
intended to take your father -- to
help us -- to finish our work No

one else was supposed to get hurt

A FLASH -- brief staccato blasts of memory -- of SEVEN-
YEAR-OLD JONNY -- in his home -- a warm inviting house --
SHATTERED as ARMED MEN flood inside -- GUNS BLAZING --

We see DR QUEST pulling his son to safety -- covering
Jonny with his own body as -- the boy screams out for

A BLONDE WOM -- we don’t see her face but we know it’s
Jonny’ s MOTHER -- falling -- lying still on the floor

And the one thing Jonny never remembered until now

A FACE -- the man who shot her -- scarred and severe --
KORCHEK

BACK TO SCENE

Jonny reels Unable to process this He looks to his
father -- sees tears in Quest’s eyes

SURD
We’ve all made sacrifices You
Me Your mother But in time
youll come to understand This is
all for the greater good

One of Surd’s assistants forces Quest toward the Ray’s
control console He enters the 512-bit encryption ke

And instantly -- the RAY POWERS UP -- A BEAM OF ENERGY
arcing into the stone lotus -- on screen -- we see the
mineral structures EVAPORATING Leaving only living cells

As Surd -- carefully -- extracts one of the cells Quest
Jonny Race and Hadji are ushered through a door into

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

A high-end control hub Covered with consoles and video
screens Dominated by a huge OBSERVATION WINDOW made from
six-inch safety glass Currently it’s covered with a
steel screen Quest Jonny Hadji and Race are forced into
seats High-tech restraints snapping shut on their wrists

Quest looks drained Dead

QUEST
I’m sorry Jonny Your mother
(barely gets the words out)
You were right It was my fault

Jonny is furious But for the first time in five years
not at his father He looks up Eyes HARD

JONNY
No dad It was their fault

SURD and KORCHEK arrive -- the scientist giddy with the
headiness of the moment

QUEST
You don’t have to do this
Jeremiah There’s still time --

SURD
Still time I’m on the verge of
the greatest discovery in the
history of man And you want me to
simply throw it away Why

HADJI
What you are doing is wrong The
gods never intended this weapon to
be used again

KORCHEK
Then may they strike us down for
our sacrilege
(smiles)
See The gods want to know what’11l
happen just as much as we do

Surd hits a switch the steel screen rising up to REVEAL
A vault-like BIO-SAFETY LAB The type of chamber where
scientists work with the most dangerous materials our world
has ever known -- Ebola virus Anthrax VX nerve gas

And now A single cell containing the Brahmastra

Korchek watches as Surd directs his assistants -- suited-up
in fully-enclosed bio-containment suits -- via an intercom

SURD
Initiate test alpha-one Now

As Surd’s men leap into action -- Jonny looks to Hadji
JONNY
This thing this weapon -- what is
it really Hadji

HADJI
(softly)
The wrath of god
On the monitors -- we see Surd’s assistants insert the cell
-- contained in a tiny glass vial -- into a high-tech
thermal heater As the temperature climbs -- 65 C -- 75 --
SURD

Proceed to the activation
temperature for subject A

They connect the heating device to a vacuum valve on the
side a plexiglas “cage” containing several scuttling
COCKROACHES Air whooshes as it twists in -- creating a
perfect seal between the heater and the cage The
temperature reaches 100 C and the heater WHOOSHES open

At first nothing happens

Then one of the cockroaches starts to tremble Its tiny
antennae twitching as if stirring in some invisible wind

Soon all of the cockroaches have begun to shiver Tiny
legs trembling The walls of the plexiglas cage flexing --
almost breathing -- in and out Faster and faster The
plastic chamber dancing atop the lab table as it vibrates

A SOUND -- like buzzing bees but rolling like thunder --
it rises over the intercom louder and louder until THE
SPEAKERS BLOWOUT silencing it And in that silence

A tiny SPARK -- like a microscopic firefly -- flits around
the interior of the cage circling the roaches until --
KORCHEK

Let there be light

IT STRIKES Like TEN THOUSAND ARROWS MADE OF LIGHTNING

Blindingly brilliant moving faster than fast it BLASTS
the roaches away -- blowing them apart -- atom by atom --
striking again and again turning them to fluttering ash

It’s beautiful and horrific all at once And it doesn’t
stop there
The light -- the Brahmastra -- seems to swell inside the
plexiglas cage Growing brighter Faster Throwing
itself against its confines with incredible force until --

The plexiglas BURSTS into jagged pieces -- the arrows of
light SWEEPING ACROSS THE BIO-SAFETY LAB obliterating
everything in their path Equipment melts test tubes
shatter and liquefy -- the assistants flee for the exits --

But the Brahmastra expands like the shock-wave of a
nuclear holocaust tiny glowing arrowheads piercing their
suits -- turning their bodies to ash -- still inside

Their screams silent behind the safety glass It all
happens in one brief moment So bright it’s hard to watch
but impossible to look away Then a heart-beat later --

The light fades The Brahmastra dissipates as if it were
never there and all that’s left are wafting flecks of ash

The observation room is silent Stunned
KORCHEK
Congratulations doctor You’ve
done it

Surd is beside himself Unprepared for what he witnessed

SURD
There’s still much to do I
promise you this power -- it can

be harnessed I just need the time
to study it To to

A SHOT rings out A mist of blood blossoming from Surd’s
breast Confusion clouds his face -- just for a moment --

Then he collapses out of his chair Dead
Korchek holsters his gun Steps over Surd to the intercom

KORCHEK
Initiate stage two

Outside the observation room in the main lab Korchek’s
men instantly spring into action With QUICK BURSTS from
their guns they EXECUTE every one of Surd’s assistants

Then Korchek’s men transfer the remainder of the
Brahmastra cells into a portable containment unit

Quest looks from Surd’s body to Korchek Not surprised
Outside the lab they can
Brahmastra to a side door
monitors

QUEST
You never intended to let him
complete his research did you
You never wanted this weapon
harnessed for the “good of man”

KORCHEK
A weapon’s purpose is destruction
Dr Quest If the gods created
this that’s how they intended it
to be used I am merely a servant
of their will

RACE
Yeah you’re a regular saint

JONNY
What are you gonna do with it

The same warhead Race let him escape with in

KORCHEK
The problem with the world today
isn’t a lack of faith It isa

see Korchek’s men carrying the
-- Korchek hits a few keys and on
a very familiar image appears A MIRV warhead

the Ukraine

lack of fear True fear Of power

beyond our feeble guns Our
piddling bombs Of power divine

Korchek’s men insert the container into the weapon load of
the warhead Locking it in place Then a mechanical arm

seizes

INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE

Apparently this silo isn’t as nonfunctional as it appeared

Fuel lines run to its boosters

to the

top

Korchek shows them a REMOTE LAUNCH CONTROL

KORCHEK
Now I have that power

HADJI
You plan to use it against people

A haze of mist envelops

The warhead is

which rises quickly
KORCHEK
Once I release the footage of that
test I won’t have to Every
country in the world will empty its
coffers to buy its safety Think
of it Armed with the weapon of
the gods I will accomplish what no
man ever has I will become the
world’s first one-man super-power
As is my destiny As I was chosen

JONNY
You’re nuts

KORCHEK
Was Napoleon Was Genghis Khan
Was Alexander the Great

RACE
Yeah they were

KORCHEK
And yet even they never dreamed of
power like this

SUDDENLY WARNING LIGHTS FLASH on the control console An
alarm BEEPS insistent Annoyed Korchek turns to his men

KORCHEK
What is that

They don’t need to answer Inside the Bio-Safety lab he
can instantly see that something is very very VERY wrong

The air is stirring CRACKLING with light like the inside
of a lightning storm an electron buzzing around an atom

Korchek throws one of his men aside studying the read-outs
himself Internal pressure is rising into the RED
Korchek swivels his gun toward Quest --

KORCHEK
What’s happening

QUEST
This power it can’t be controlled
It can’t be contained Not by
Surd and certainly not by you

The CONTAINMENT ALARM starts to WAIL -- we can see hairline
cracks appearing across the safety glass Korchek closes
the steel screen -- but it begins to blossom out Giving
RACE
I think what he’s trying to say is
you screwed with something you
shouldn’t have screwed with Now
you’re screwed

With a concussive blast a deafening WAIL -- the door to
the containment lab -- leading back into the main lab --

BLASTS OFF ITS HINGES The Brahmastra SWEEPS OUT into the
main complex Moving across it like death made manifest

Striking like lightning Howling like a thousand
hurricanes Korchek’s men try to run but they’re blasted

apart before our eyes -- BLOWN TO ASHES Their guns
clatter to the floor Their screams lost in the howl of
the weapon -- rushing past like a gale force wind

Seeing this from inside the observation room Korchek’s
face goes pale Afraid His gun goes to Jonny’s head

KORCHEK
(to Quest)
FIX THIS NOW

And that’s when Race moves -- a blinding blur his foot
KICKING OUT -- knocking the pistol out of Korchek’s hand

Korchek’s guards go for their rifles -- but Race is too
fast -- too good -- out of his seat taking them down with
vicious punches and judo throws He jams one through a
console killing the siren Wheels on Korchek -- but --

Korchek is gone sprinting out an escape hatch A steel
door SLAMMING SHUT behind him Eletromag locks sealing it

Race moves quickly working at Jonny’s restraints first

He uses a high-tech LOCK-PICK small as a mailbox key but
bristling with attachments And oddly caked with dried
rust-colored GUNK Jonny’s shackles instantly pop open

JONNY
(amazed)
Where’d you get that

Race pulls back his collar shows the wound where Jade
stabbed him We can tell that’s where he extracted it

HADJI
From Jade
RACE
She knew it was the only place they
wouldn’t search

JONNY
Man you guys have a messed up
relationship

RACE
Tell me about it

He moves on to Hadji Quest freeing them too Quest
quickly moves to the door Korchek disappeared through --

HADJI
I don’t suppose Jade’s device will
work on that as well

QUEST
(shakes no)
It’s magnetically locked I opened
one before Took me twelve hours

RACE
Doc we barely have twelve seconds

The Brahmastra swirls behind the door to the lab --
tendrils of the light seeping through cracks in the steel

JONNY
What do we do

It looks like they’re done for until --
-- KORCHEK’s ESCAPE DOOR SUDDENLY UNLOCKS AND SLIDES OPEN

SURD clings to the console his finger on the code pad It
seems to be taking all his strength to hold himself steady

Not one to look a gift-horse in the mouth Race grabs one
of the guard’s guns MHurries Jonny and Hadji to the door

RACE
Come on Go We gotta leave now

But Quest is waiting for Surd The man killed his wife
but his innate goodness won’t let him leave Surd behind

QUEST
Jeremiah Come with us Please

Surd shakes his head a splotch of blood at his lips
SURD
The door can only be sealed from
the inside It’1l buy you a little
more time

QUEST
Jeremiah --

SURD
I’m sorry I know it doesn’t make
up for what I’ve done But I

pray you can
Race grabs Quest’s shoulder --

RACE
Doc we don’t go now we don’t go

Quest nods He and Race hurry through the door as Surd
seals it behind them The last thing they see -- as the
door slams shut -- is the Brahmastra BURST through the

safety glass Reducing Surd’s body to a cloud of ashes

INT KORCHEK’S COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - DAY

Jonny Hadji Quest and Race sprint down the shadowy hall
Behind them the door to the observation room balloons out
steel buckling as the pressure inside continues to grow

RACE
Korchek must have an escape route
somewhere We gotta find it fast

JONNY
How
Jonny rounds the corner -- just as a BARRAGE OF BULLETS
ricochets off the wall near his head -- Quest and Race both

pull him back almost at the same time

HADJI
I’d guess we go in the direction
they don’t want us to

RACE
Good guess

AROUND THE CORNER a pair of Korchek’s mercs have taken up
firing positions next to a sealed door One more step and
the Quest team would have stumbled right into a kill-zone

Race peeks his head out -- jerking back as more SHOTS FIRE
JONNY
(again)
How
Deep breath -- Race bursts around the corner his gun
blazing The mercs -- taken by surprise -- try to fire
back -- but Race is too fast and too good BLAM BLAM
Drops them with a headshot each Jonny is impressed
JONNY
Wow
RACE

Don’t tell anyone but I kinda had
my eyes closed

The team races toward the door sliding open to reveal
A THIRD MERC His sidearm aimed straight at Race’s face
Race doesn’t even have time to blink when --

BLAM The merc’s head jerks to the side and he collapses
like a broken doll Smoke curls from the barrel of a gun
held in the hand of JADE

RACE
You’re late

JADE
I’m never late You just get in
trouble too early
(re behind her)
Come on Korchek went this way

As they run Jonny and Hadji stare at Jade amazed looks

JONNY
How’d you find us

JADE
I’ve been shadowing Korchek’s ship
since Moy Tu Handing you over was
the only way to save your lives

HADJI
(in love)
I knew you wouldn’t betray us

RACE
I wasn’t so sure

She runs next to Race notes the blood on his shoulder
JADE
So you found my little gift

RACE
Yeah Remind me to return the
favor when we get outta here

Behind them they hear the observation room door BLAST
OPEN The moan of the Brahmastra shrieking into the hall

RACE
If we get outta here

JADE
What was that

RACE
Tell you on the way Go

They sprint through the door as the tendrils of light
close in behind them Jade hits the button sealing it --

-- seconds before the Brahmastra can reach it The metal
instantly begins to melt and buckle and give way

INT ANOTHER CORRIDOR - DAY

The Quest team hustles down another hallway heading toward
a set of huge double doors The doors open to REVEAL

INT AN UNDERGROUND HANGAR

A massive subterranean chamber every inch of floor-space
covered with the latest in high-tech vehicles in various
states of completion Part garage part laboratory This
was where Surd perfected his inventions for Korchek

QUEST
Surd must have something here we
can use to escape
They see hovercraft prototypes cutter precursors and
A HYPER-MODERN JET

Sleek Like nothing we’ve seen before Clearly this is
the prototype inspiration for Surd’s Trojan Horse ship

It’s a VERTOL JET VERtical Take-Off and Landing -- like a
Harrier and -- at the moment -- it’s powering up

KORCHEK stands near the plane hunkered over a control
console He hits a few keys as -- overhead -- a set of
HUGE HANGAR DOORS starts to open

He sees them just as they see him Bringing his auto-
pistol up FIRING Backing toward the jet’s cargo ramp

QUEST
That jet’s our only way out
RACE
Then we’re gonna be on it When I
say run
KA-CHUNK Race slams in a clip -- OPENS FIRE on Korchek

pinning him down keeping him away from the ramp

RACE
Run

The Quest team makes a break for it dodging through the
hangar making their way toward the jet’s access ramp

Korchek tries to draw a bead on them but -- A BARRAGE from
Race forces him to take cover behind a helicopter chassis

By the time he comes up to fire again -- Race has closed
the gap between them RUSHING him

Korchek tries to get off a shot but --

Race BROAD TACKLES him sending their weapons skittering
across the floor out of reach

They roll across the hangar floor -- until Korchek flips
Race over his shoulder They both regain their feet at the
same time Squaring off Mano-a-mano

The two men join in full-on balls-out one-on-one combat
No guns No gadgets This is a battle up close and
personal waged by two men trained -- and born -- to kill
WHILE INSIDE THE JET --

Quest and Jade usher Hadji and Jonny inside Jonny is
hesitant to board

JONNY
What about Race

JADE
Race can take care of himself
Quest moves toward the cockpit Manning the controls

QUEST
I’1l have us ready for lift-off in
one minute

JONNY

Race better take care of himself

quick
A HUGE WRENCH SMASHES DOWN ON RACE’S ARM --
Raised just in time to block it from bashing his head
Probably broke some bones but Race fights on twisting the
wrench out of Korchek’s hand Breaking a few fingers
Behind them the plane’s engines start to power up

JET-WASH blasting out the back whipping their clothes and
hair buffeting the two men as they continue to battle

Korchek aims a kick at Race’s head -- but Race ducks --
GRABS his leg and SWINGS HIM like a sack of potatoes --

WHAM Into the side of a mini-sub Korchek lands in a
heap Gasping Wind knocked out of him

RACE
That was for the kid
But Korchek climbs back up the ICBM REMOTE in hand
KORCHEK

Listen to me Either you let me on
that jet or I launch --

AN UPPERCUT SNAPS HIS HEAD BACK Race didn’t even wait for
him to finish The remote skips across the hangar floor

coming to stop next to Korchek’s gun He scrambles
after it hands and knees Race is about to give chase --

JONNY
RACE

He sees Jonny on the jet’s ramp the engines shifting down
into VERTOL mode the plane lifting shakily off the ground

JONNY
Come on There’s no time
He’s right Fissures of light are blossoming on the door
to the hangar The unstoppable Brahmastra BLASTING INSIDE

Race runs -- leaps -- grabs hold of the cargo ramp just as
the jet lifts off

The blast from its engines pushing the Brahmastra back

KORCHEK -- seeing his chance to escape soaring toward the
roof -- climbs up a scaffold -- makes a desperate leap --

-- While Jonny hurries to help Race clinging to the ramp
as the jet continues to rise higher

JONNY
Race Here take my hand

Race seizes it Hadji Jade hurry to help pull him in
And just as he makes it he finds --

THE BARREL OF AN AUTO-PISTOL in his face Korchek gun in
one hand remote in the other He’s made it into the jet

KORCHEK
You couldn’t kill me then You
can’t kill me now I told you I
was chosen Chosen to survive

He places the pistol to Race’s forehead About to fire

RACE
If you believe that Korchek

Race -- lightning quick -- GRABS the stock of the pistol
YANKS OUT the KATAR and -- PLUNGES it in Korchek’s chest

RACE
Let’s see you do it again

A look of confusion comes over Korchek’s face as he topples
back off the ramp Plummeting down down down

into the gathering lightning storm of the Brahmastra

The massive malevolent cloud seems to “catch” him in mid-
air its tendrils invading his nostrils his eyes the
pores on his skin devouring his body from the inside out

As his body is consumed the last thing that remains is HIS
HAND Still gripping the ICBM remote Perhaps by some
random muscle twitch or perhaps by intention his finger
tightens on the trigger The remote’s light turns GREEN

EXT HANGAR - DAY

The jet rockets out of the hangar doors The flames from
its afterburners BLASTING DOWN on the escaping Brahmastra
the heat so intense it burns up the cloud vaporizing it

They made it they did it but before they can celebrate --
A CIRCULAR BUNKER OPENS from the mountainside beneath them

THE ICBM -- armed with the Brahmastra -- ROCKETS OUT
BLASTING PAST THEM -- heading for the blue sky above

INT JET - DAY

Stunned silence as they watch the missile’s contrail
streaking into the sky

RACE
(to Quest)
This thing have a radio

INT INTELLIGENCE ONE HQ - DAY
Corvin is feeding Bandit a doggy snack making kissy-faces
when Roberts bursts in the door One look and Corvin can
tell this is important She follows Roberts out into --
COMMAND CONTROL

-- Where her agents wait at their stations eerily silent

CORVIN
Bannon’s broadcasting What is it

INDIAN AGENT
It’s bad ma’am

CORVIN
How bad

NERDY AGENT

Armageddon bad “I am become
Death destroyer of worlds” bad
Holy crap we’re all gonna die bad
a’ am

Bandit whines

INT JET - DAY

Race -- listening intently to the headset -- his face
darkens He pulls off the earphones Turns to the others
RACE
They’ve analyzed the ICBM’s
trajectory It’1l detonate over
the eastern seaboard in twenty-
seven minutes They’re scrambling
missile defenses but

JONNY
They won’t make it in time

Race shakes his head Not even close

HADJI
There is nothing we can do

QUEST (0S)
That may not be entirely true

He looks up from the jet’s control panel --

QUEST
This jet its propulsion technology
-- it’s similar to what Surd used
in his Trojan Horse but beyond
even that The potential thrust is
off the charts Jeremiah always
had a brilliant mind for
aeronautics

JADE
What does all that mean

QUEST
It means we might have a chance

He looks to Race Race nods

Quest’s fingers fly over the controls

RACE
Everyone Strap in

and as they do --

The jet starts to TRANSFORM In mid-air it shifts into

hyper-speed mode

reveal

A ROCKET WITH WINGS

Race slips into the control seat beside Quest
make sure everybody is strapped in behind him

A NEW THROTTLE rises out of the console

RACE
Let’s see what this baby can do

louvered panels sliding aside to

Checks to

He eases it back
EXT JET - DAY

Blink and the JET IS GONE Dwindling into the sky Forget
super-sonic this thing’s almost faster than light Okay
that’s hyperbole but it’s REALLY REALLY FAST

INT COCKPIT
Jonny’s cheeks flap in the mind-blowing G forces

JONNY
This Is Awesome

The ICBM appears as a blip on a 3D RADAR DISPLAY arcing
through the skies Nearing the apex of its trajectory

QUEST
If my calculations are correct
we’1ll intercept the ICBM in
nineteen minutes twelve seconds
Here on its downward trajectory
three miles off the coast

RACE
What do we do when we intercept it

JADE
Doesn’t this thing have any
weapons Guns Anything

QUEST
(scanning the systems)
ot installed

RACE

Perfect Then you’ve got
(checks the clock)

Eighteen minutes to come up
with a better plan than us stopping
that missile by flying into it
Good luck doc

Quest unstraps hurries across the cabin -- vibrating with
the strain of their speed -- heading toward the cargo hold

QUEST
(to Jade)
If you’1ll assist me madam

JADE
Finally someone who knows how to
talk to a lady
She unstraps and follows Only Jonny and Hadji are left

JONNY
What should we do

RACE
Pray

Hadji already is
INT CARGO HOLD

Apparently this was some kind of mobile workshop for Surd

Crates are stacked everywhere -- random pieces of

electronics wires circuit boards spilling out Jade

stares at all of this -- and it’s too much to even process
JADE

Where do we even start

But -- creating order from chaos seeing solutions where
others can’t that’s Benton Quest’s gift

His eyes take in a tank of CO2 A disassembled computer
One of Surd’s spider robots lying on a worktable with its
electronic innards exposed And a half dozen other things
that we can’t even keep up with Lightning quick

QUEST
(pointing)
Get me that That One of those
A soldering iron And as much
strong rope as you can find

As Jade springs into action
INT COCKPIT

Quest sits with Race talking quietly Jonny struggles to
eavesdrop But the roar of the engines makes it difficult

QUEST
It’s dangerous Bordering on
insane

RACE

Sounds like my kinda plan What’s
the problem

QUEST
It’1ll take all of us to pull it
off You Jade me There’ll be
no one left to fly the plane
RACE
Autopilot

QUEST
Probably scheduled to go in with
the guns

As they contemplate -- a voice PIPES UP

JONNY
I can fly it

They both turn to look at him He’s intimidated with their
eyes on him but Jonny screws up his courage

JONNY
You said you need someone to fly
the jet I’11 do it I can do it

QUEST
Absolutely not

JONNY
But dad --

QUEST

Lives are at stake Jonny This
isn’t a game

JONNY
I know that I --
QUEST
No End of discussion
Jonny looks to Race pleading
RACE

I say we give the kid a shot What
else have we got to lose

QUEST
You’d trust your life to him The
lives of millions Tens of
millions

RACE
Over the last few days I’ve seen
your son pilot just about
everything that drives floats or
flies If I’m better than him
it’s damn close I would trust him
without a moment’s hesitation
Quest looks from Race to Jonny Inscrutable Finally

QUEST
Then show my son the controls

He goes placing a hand on Jonny’s shoulder as he does
The look between them it conveys a lot Trust Love
But it only lasts a moment That’s all there’s time for

Quest heads to the rear and Jonny takes the driver’s seat

HADJI
What should I do

JONNY
Pray harder Hadji Pray as hard
as you can

EXT ICBM - DAY

The missile streaks through the upper atmosphere As it
reaches its apex and begins its descent we notice
something strange Its nose cone seems to GLOW slivers of
light blossoming from the metal forming IMAGES FACES
like the Hindu cave carvings Frozen in silent screams

As the missile plummets toward the coast of Florida the
sound of its boosters becoming an eerie unearthly HOWL

INT JET - DAY

Jonny can just make it out -- bright as a shooting star --
blazing across the sky He pushes the jet for all it’s
worth White-knuckling the stick

JONNY
(into headset)
You guys ready back there Dad

CARGO HOLD

Sparks fly as Quest wields his soldering iron putting the
finishing touches on something we can’t quite see

QUEST
I need two minutes

JONNY (ON RADIO)
No problem I’11 tell the missile
to slow down Race You ready

Jade straps Race into a harness -- one of the harnesses the
frogmen used on Palm Key -- attached to a coil of ROPE
RACE
As long as nobody reminds me what
I’m about to do

Quest waves Race over The solder’s still hot on the
DEVICE he’s building but it’s as ready as it’1l ever be

QUEST

I was able to splice in the
targeting system from one of Surd’s
robots -- it should lock on but
you’re gonna have to get it close
keep it steady and fire it
manually

RACE
Just show me which button to push

Quest and Jade lift the device together strapping it to
Race’s shoulder -- an odd cluster of wires blossoming from
the CO2 cannister It looks unmistakable like a CANNON a
tiny targeting monitor soldered to the barrel

JADE
Try not to screw this up

RACE
(grins)
Thanks for the pep talk

SUDDENLY WIND RUSHES IN as -- the REAR CARGO RAMP begins
to OPEN Quest manning the controls

QUEST
(into headset)
We’re ready back here Now get us
in range You can do it Jonny

EXT JET - DAY

The jet screams across the water its afterburners cutting
a wake through the sparkling waves

IN THE COCKPIT

Jonny is the picture of focus not about to let them down
This is the most frightening -- and exhilarating -- moment
of his life But it’s a lot to handle

JONNY
Please God let me do this right
Or gods Or whoever’s listening
The only one there is Hadji -- his eyes shut his hands
clasped before him his lips silently muttering sim
sim sala sim sala bim

As he chants a wind rises around him stirring his
clothes surrounding him in a haze of FAINT GLOWING LIGHT

EXT ICBM - DAY

The missile dives toward the ocean nosing up at the last
second screaming past above the waves zeroing in on its
target MIAMI

The Jet follows -- the burn from its engines as brilliant
as a supernova

JONNY

mans the stick like it’s part of him Squeezing every
ounce of speed out of the aircraft

THE JET pulls into the missile’s contrail its smoke
billowing past them -- enveloping the windshield -- then --

Jonny pulls even with it Passing it

Now he’s leading the ICBM Speeding low above the water
straight for the skyscraper skyline of Miami beach
Rushing closer Closer every second

JONNY
(into headset)
In position Race you’re up

IN THE CARGO HOLD

Race stands huddled at the front of the hold holding onto
whatever he can The ramp is now open and the rush of wind
is amazing Deafening We can see the nose of the
missile rocketing about a hundred yards behind them --

A hand-signal from Quest “Go”
A brief look of “What the hell am I doing” crosses Race’s

face then he slings the makeshift cannon onto his shoulder
and steps away from the wall --

The WIND instantly seizes him pulling him toward the open
ramp Luckily --

-- THE ROPE goes TAUT the harness around his waist keeping
him from flying out the back

Its other end is tethered near Jade who carefully lets out
slack as Race makes his way toward the end of the ramp
Step by step While

IN THE COCKPIT
Miami nears you can almost see the bikinis from here
RACE

reaches the end of his rope his toes hanging ten off the
edge of the ramp He swings up the weapon’s barrel
struggling to aim in the incredible wind

The targeting display swims before him He tries to put
the reticle on the missile but the display keeps flashing

NO LOCK NO LOCK NO LOCK

RACE
(into headset)
It’s not locking on I can’t get a
lock

IN THE COCKPIT

They’re coming up on Miami Speeding toward the beach
Passing over yachts and sport fishing boats

JONNY
Try harder We’re running out of
ocean here Fifteen seconds out

Behind him Hadji HOVERS above his seat His GLOW has
intensified Spreading across the cockpit Jonny’s too
focused on flying to notice it

CARGO HOLD

But it’s spreading here too Faintly Creeping across
the walls the floor stretching out from the front of the
plane to the back to Race

JONNY (ON RADIO)
Ten seconds

Race struggles to aim He holds the weapon as still as he
can The glow surrounds Race almost invisible in the
rushing wind and suddenly --

JONNY (ON RADIO)
FIVE

LOCK LOCK LOCK

RACE
I got lock

He pulls the trigger -- KA-FOOSH The cannon FIRES
spewing a cloud of frozen CO2 -- a PROJECTILE EXPLODES out
of the barrel arcing across the sky -- closing the gap
between the ramp and the missile -- in mid-air --

BLOSSOMING WITH SIX SPINDLY METAL LEGS

One leg LATCHES onto the ICBM’s nose cone -- allowing the
SPIDER-BOT to pull itself onto the speeding missile Its
thread-thin legs snaking into its circuitry REPROGRAMMING
IT -- OVERRIDING its GUIDANCE CONTROL --

RACE

Hit HIT
-- JONNY yanks the stick -- peeling the jet away just as --
EXT MIAMI BEACH - DAY
Sunbathers stare point as the ICBM SCREAMS toward them --
Changing course at the last possible second --
ROCKETING UP UP UP
Where it EXPLODES in the upper atmosphere
A BLAZE OF LIGHT as BRIGHT as a thousand suns shining
together And within the cloud of smoke and coruscating
dust that expands in its aftermath we see something within

it beautiful and terrible and undeniably unearthly

Just for a moment so quick we think we might’ve imagined
it -- we see the face of god And then GONE

All that’s left is the SHOCK WAVE rippling across the sky
INT JET - VARIOUS - DAY

The Quest team watches through the open cargo door --
through the windshield -- Ecstatic They did it Jonny
lets out a whoop Hadji opens his eyes dropping six
inches back into his seat Exhausted But beaming

Quest powers the ramp shut Jade reels Race back in She
grabs his harness yanking him in close for a kiss when --

THE SHOCK WAVE hits them like a MACK TRUCK --

IN THE COCKPIT WARNING ALARMS WAIL The DIALS GO DARK

Jonny struggles with stick but

He’s lost all control

Race RUNS through the cabin -- tailed by Jade and Quest --
leaps into the copilot seat -- seizing the second stick --

Race grins Damnit but he likes this kid

RACE
When I say pull up pull up with

all you’ve got

sucker down

in one piece

We’re setting this

The ocean looms closer -- blasting toward them at
incredible speed -- they can see the white peaks of the
waves -- the tiny islands of Florida’s keys --

Knowing this might be the last chance he gets Jonny calls

JONNY
Dad I’m sorry For
everything I love you

QUEST
I love you too Jonny
A moment as their eyes connect -- father and son -- then --
RACE
Here we go PULL UP NOW

EXT OCEAN - DAY

The jet SCREAMS out of the sky airbrakes deployed --
shuddering as they blast through the wind -- one of the
brakes SHEERS OFF -- fluttering away behind -- as the metal
bird noses up -- right before it HITS THE WATER --

A MASSIVE SPLASH as the jet skips across the waves like a
thrown stone

IN THE COCKPIT
Race wrestles the controls -- Jonny too -- the windshield

SHATTERS IN -- water hitting them like a firehose --
there’s little they can do now but hold on and hope

THE JET CAREENS through the water -- clipping jagged rocks
and reefs -- RIPPING GAPING HOLES in the cabin walls --

Sand SPRAYS IN as they skew sideways -- ROLLING -- end over
end -- then TREES -- PALM TREES -- snapping under its
weight -- and finally after what seems like an eternity
The fuselage grinds to a slow shuddering STOP

EXT JET - DAY

RACE’S HAND appears from the hole where the windshield was
Pulls himself out And what he sees outside

Are white sand beaches Lush green foliage Paradise

PALM KEY They made it They’re alive They’re home

Race looks back to make sure everyone’s okay A little
worse for wear but everyone seems fine With one
noticeable exception

Jonny
He’s GONE His seat empty A GIANT HOLE GAPING beside it

QUEST
JONNY

EXT PALM KEY - DAY

An I-1 HELICOPTER sets down on the helipad Corvin and
Roberts step out followed closely by Bandit The second
the dog hits the sand he perks up Sensing something

He dashes out ahead of them hurrying toward --
THE CRASH SITE

Where Quest Race Hadji and Jade are climbing out of the
downed craft frantically searching for Jonny Calling out
for him Fearing the worst

Bandit scampers into the waves Emerging with something
clenched in his teeth

Jonny’s collar With Jonny attached Sputtering and
soaking wet but alive

Quest runs to his son grabs him in a bear hug holding on
for dear life Jonny hugs him back Dazed from the crash

JONNY
I think we broke the plane dad

QUEST
(laughs)
Don’t worry I can fix it

Bandit licks Jonny’s face As he wrestles with his dog
Jonny sees Hadji watching Feeling out of place Jonny
leads his dad and his dog over to him

JONNY
Dad This is Hadji Hadji this
is my dad Hadji’s gonna come stay
with us okay

QUEST
(he bows to the boy)
Namaste Hadji You can stay with
us as long as you like

As if to make it official Bandit leaps on the Hindu boy
licking his face As Hadji laughs feeling like he truly
belongs For the first time in a long time

Race watches from the beach Grinning despite himself
Jade watches him

JADE
I never thought I’d see the day
Race Bannon goes soft And over a
kid no less

RACE
I hate kids

She laughs He turns Earnest maybe for the first time

RACE
You know -- this probably sounds
crazy -- but why couldn’t we go
soft together Here We got sand
Surf Flaming wreckage What more
could we want

For a moment she seems to be considering it but then

JADE
It’s tempting I admit but
Race the only children I could
stand being around would be my own
(leans closer whispers)
When I’m ready for that I’11 know
where to find you

He pulls her into a KISS breathtaking against the pink hue
of the setting sun Then as they come up for air

She turns and goes To where we don’t know but we
know we’1ll see her again After all Jade’s a survivor

Finally Corvin and Roberts make their way down the beach
flanked by agents They hurry over to Quest and Race
shaking hands congratulating

CORVIN
You did it Bannon Dr Quest
The country -- the world owes you

both a debt of gratitude

RACE
Not just us We had some help

Quest couldn’t agree more Jonny and Hadji exchange a
look Proud But the congratulations are short lived

There’s something else on the agents’ minds Corvin and
Roberts pull Quest aside Their voices low

ROBERTS
We realize the timing isn’t ideal --

CORVIN
(brushes her lackey aside)
Look we’ve found well we’re
not sure what it is But we need
you to examine it immediately If
you’re up to it

Quest considers then nods

QUEST
I’1l1 need a team

ROBERTS

You’ll have the best I-11 CIA

NSA Military Whatever you need
As Quest looks toward Jonny Hadji Race and Bandit we
