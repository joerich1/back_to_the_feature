LOVE ACTUALLY

INT HEATHROW ARRIVALS GATE DAY 1
A VOICEOVER IN DARKNESS

PM (VO)
“ Whenever I get gloomy with the state of
the world I think about the Arrival Gate
at Heathrow Airport

AND WE START TO SEE THIS — AS ‘STYLISH BUT REAL’ DOCUMENTARY AS
POSSIBLE THE MOST MISCELLANEOUS OF GROUPS AND COUPLES AT THE
ARRIVAL GATE ALL KISSING ALL FULL OF AFFECTION AND EMOTION

General opinion’s starting to make out that
we live in a world of hatred and greed —
but I don’t see that - seems to me that
love is everywhere Often it’s not
particularly dignified or newsworthy — but
it’s always there — fathers and sons mothers
and daughters husbands and wives friends and
strangers When the planes hit the Twin
Towers as far as I know none of the phone
calls from the people about to die were
messages of hate and revenge - they were
all messages of love If you look for it
I’ve got a nasty suspicion you’1ll find that
love actually is all around

INT CHURCH DAY 2

CUT TO TWO MEN’S FACES WELL DRESSED UP IN WEDDING TIES AND
COATS

PETER
No surprises

MARK
No surprises

PULL BACK — THEY ARE BEST MAN AND GROOM WAITING AT THE END OF AN
AISLE THE CHURCH IS SUNNY AND FULL

PETER
Not like the stag night

MARK
Unlike the stag night

PETER
Do you admit that the Brazilian prostitutes
were a mistake

MARK
I do

PETER
And it would have been much better if
they’ not turned out to be men

MARK
That is true

THE MUSIC STARTS UP PACHELBEL’S CANON ENTER A REALLY LOVELY
OPTIMISTIC GIRL IN HER WEDDING DRESS THIS IS JULIET

MARK (CONTD)
Good luck kiddo

AND HE PICKS UP HIS VIDEO AND STARTS DISCREETLY TO FILM
PROCEEDINGS — IT’S ONE OF THOSE WHERE YOU CAN VIEW THROUGH A
SCREEN RATHER THAN HOLDING IT TO YOUR EYE

AS THE BRIDE WALKS UP THE AISLE A SWEET SLIGHTLY CHAOTIC 30
YEAR OLD CALLED SARAH SNEAKS IN JUST BEHIND HER SWITCHING OFF
AND PUTTING AWAY HER MOBILE PHONE SHE SITS DOWN NEXT TO A
FRIEND CALLED JAMIE 38 GOOD-LOOKING AND GOODNATURED

THE BRIDE GOES ON WALKING — EXCHANGING A BLISSFUL SMILE WITH HER
HUSBAND TO BE

WE CUT THROUGH MOMENTS OF THE WEDDING SERVICE — FINGERS RINGS
KISS BIBLES SIGNING THE REGISTRY IT’S NOW THE END OF THE
SERVICE - THEY’RE BACK IN FRONT OF THE ALTAR

PETER
And you resisted the temptation for any
surprises

MARK
Yes I’m mature now

NOW BRIDE AND GROOM TURN AND HEAD DOWN THE AISLE THE ORGAN
STRIKES UP A TRADITIONAL CHURCH EXIT SONG THEN IT CHANGES AND
STARTS TO PLAY SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE THE
MARSEILLAISE PETER LOOKS A BIT SURPRISED — TURNS TO LOOK AT
MARK WHO LOOKS INNOCENT

AS THE MUSIC CHANGES A CURTAIN THAT HAS BEEN HIDING THE
CONTENTS OF THE BALCONY DROPS BEHIND IT IS A HUNDRED STRONG
CHOIR THEY BEGIN TO SING

CHOIR
Love love love
Love love love
Love love love

FINAL JUNE 19602

THE CHOIR THEN PART TO REVEAL A FABULOUS LOOKING SINGER
STANDING AT A MICROPHONE SINGING ‘ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE’

SINGER
Nothing you can do that can’t be done
Nothing you can sing that can’t be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how
to play the game
It’s easy

ALL
All you need is love

THEY ARE NOW JOINED DURING THE CHORUS — MAGICALLY FROM ALL
OVER THE CHURCH — BY A HUGE BRASS SECTION — 20 TRUMPETS — 20
SAXOPHONES ETC THEY ACTUALLY APPEAR IN THE PEWS WHERE THEY’ VE
BEEN HIDING THEIR INSTRUMENTS TILL NOW

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love love
Love is all you need
THE BRIDE JULIET IS RADIANT — ADORING IT

JULIET
Did you do this

PETER
Christ no

HUSBAND PETER LOOKS AT BEST MAN MARK MARK SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS
PRETENDING HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
THEN A LITTLE SMILE

CUT TO A FUNERAL — A MAN AND HIS 11 YEAR OLD STEP-SON IN A
CHURCH - WITH A CROWD OF 80 BEHIND THEM DRESSED IN BLACK

PRIEST
And now Daniel wishes to say one last
thing

DANIEL GETS UP AND FACES THE GUESTS BEHIND HIM A SIMPLE SLIDE-
PROJECTOR SCREEN SHOWS A PORTRAIT OF HIS WIFE

DANIEL
As you know Jo and I had a lot of time to
prepare for this moment Some of her
requests for instance that I should bring
Nicole Kidman as my date to the funeral
Im confident she expected me to ignore
But others she was pretty damn clear about
When she first mentioned what’s about to
happen I said ‘Over my dead body’ and she
said “No Danny - over mine” And as
usual my darling girl and Sam’s darling
Mum was right - 100 So she’s going to say
her final farewell to you not through me —
but inevitably ever-so-coolly through
the immortal genius of the Bay City
Rollers

THROUGH THE SPEAKERS WHAMS THE BAY CITY ROLLERS ATROCIOUS COVER
VERSION THE PROJECTOR SCREEN SHOWS TERRIBLE SHOTS OF THE
ROLLERS IN THEIR HEYDAY MORE SHOTS OF JO AND THEN SETTLES ON
AN UTTERLY GLEEFUL 12 YEAR OLD GIRL CLEARLY JO - TOTALLY DECKED
IN THE SCARF BADGES AND HATS OF ROLLERMANIA

If you hate me after what I say
Can’t put it off any longer
Oo00 S000 0000

I just gotta tell you anyway

Bye bye baby baby good-bye
Bye baby baby bye bye

Bye bye baby don’t make me cry
Bye baby baby bye bye

THE CONGREGATION ARE TORN BETWEEN SMILES AT THE SONG AND THE
STILLS AND THE REAL SADNESS OF IT ALL

HE UNLOCKS THE DOOR INTO THE LARGE LIVING ROOM AT THAT MOMENT
ANOTHER SLIGHTLY YOUNGER MAN ENTERS THE ROOM THROUGH AN INTERNAL
DOOR

JAMIE
Hello What the hell are you doing here
CHRIS
OQ I just popped over to borrow some old
CDs
JAMIE
Did the lady of the house let you in
CHRIS
Yeh
JAMIE

Lovely obliging gi-gi-girl Just thought
Id pop back before the reception see if
she was feeling better Look I was
thinking that maybe we should take Mum out
for her birthday on Friday - what do you
think I feel we’ ve been bad sons this

year

CHRIS
Okay that sounds fine — bit boring but
fine

THERE’S A CALL FROM OFF

GIRL (V0)
Put the kettle on will you darling

JAMIE
(RAISING HIS EYEBROWS) I’m a slave to love

HE STARTS TO DO SO - AND THEN CONTINUES TO DO SO SORT OF IN
SLOW MOTION AS HE TALKS ON

This is a bit odd actually My girlfriend
doesn’t know I’m here — and she calls you
‘Chris’ — not ‘da-da-darling’ — unless she
calls you ‘darling’ when I’m not here — in
which case the reason you’re here is
probably less to do with borrowing let’s
say an old Paul Simon album and more to do
with let’s say you having sex with my
girlfriend when I’m out

CHRIS
Jamie — what can I say

FINAL JUNE 19602

JAMIE
Well you could say ‘it’s not true — I AM
here because I had a passionate craving for
the music of Art Ga-ga-garfunkel’s best
friend’

GIRL (VO)
Forget the tea babe — I’ve located a
packet of 3 — if you get a move on we can
finish them off by the time old pencil-dick
comes home

JAMIE
On the other hand maybe you co-co-couldn’t
honestly say that

I hate angels - they’ re
just made-up rubbish

KAREN
0 I don’t know about that It’s just that
these days they probably don’t have wings —
so we don’t recognise them They probably
just look normal like you or me - but still
cunningly wander around doing good

BERNIE
In our play they don’t do any good at all —
they just stand there looking like poofs
and saying ‘Isn’t Baby Jesus great’ when
everyone knows he’s just a stupid doll I
want to be a lobster (HE WALKS OFF) And
by the way Toby says Uncle David is a
dickhead

after 20 minutes casually drop into the

conversation the fact that you’d like to

marry him and have lots of sex and babies

Well for actually giving a real answer to
a question Doesnt often happen here on

Ask me anything you like — I11 tell you
the truth

MIKE

that the record’s crap But you know

CUT TO JOE’S V UNHAPPY REACTION

wouldn’t it be great if Number One this
Christmas wasn’t some smug teenager — but
an ugly old ex-heroin addict searching for
a comeback at any price All these young
popsters come Christmas day they’1l be
stretched out naked with a cute bird
balancing on their balls — but I’11l be
stuck in a seedy hotel with my manager Joe -
ugliest man in the world —fucking
miserable because our fucking gamble didn’t
pay off

So if you believe in Father Christmas
children — like your Uncle Billy does — buy
my cunting record — and particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness of the moment when
we try to squeeze in an extra syllable into

MIKE
I think youre referring to “If you really
love Christmas”

BILLY
I am indeed Mike “Come on and let it
snow” Ouch

Very satisfactory indeed — we got what we

still very special

PRESS PERSON
Prime Minister

PAUSE

PM
Love that word ‘relationship — covers all
manner of sins doesn’t it I greeted the
President knowing there couldn’t be
equality with America — but I wasn’t
prepared for a total lack of give and take
I fear this has become a bad relationship
—- a relationship based on the President
taking exactly what he wants — and casually
ignoring those things that really matter
to Britain We may be a small country but
were a great country too and a friend who
bullies us is no longer a friend And since
bullies only respond to strength — from
this moment on I will be more prepared to
be less friendly And the President should
be prepared for that

SHE SITS DOWN NEXT TO HER

GERALDINE
And how was school

HEADMISTRESS
One rather strange incident Mother came in
- her son had written a really shocking
essay — and she took the boy outside — and
left me and Mr Trench waiting like a pair of
spare parts for 10 minutes before we
vealised they’d quite simply buggered off

GERALDINE
How splendid Teach you to be so pompous —
I bet the essay was excellent

HEADMISTRESS
Well actually to be honest it did have
its amusing side His Christmas wish was to
see people’s farts

GERALDINE
Bravo That’s my Christmas wish too

SHE LAUGHS — THEN SUDDENLY GETS A STAB OF PAIN AND LETS OUT A
LITTLE MOAN

HEADMISTRESS
You all right my love

GERALDINE
Yes fine — now what about these sausages —
they’re not all fancy are they — pork and
leek and apple and all that shit

HEADMISTRESS
Absolutely not (PAUSE) All right I’11
pick out the apple And the leek And the
asparagus

GERALDINE ROARS WITH LAUGHTER HEADMISTRESS TOO LOVE MAKES HER

KAREN
Thank you very much Before we finish I’d
just like to say to our headmistress Mrs
Monroe on behalf of all the parents that
we think it’s very brave her being here
today - in the light of her recent loss
Geraldine was a wonderful and wicked woman
and sorrow is particularly hard at
Christmas

WE CUT TO THE HEADMISTRESS — SHE IS WEARING DARK GLASSES SHE
JUST NODS POLITELY WE ALSO SEE HARRY SORROW-CAUSER

KAREN (CONTD)

Some of the staff have decided to help and
we ask you to forgive us our sins Thank
you

THE SONG BEGINS IN DARKNESS THE TINKLING OF INNOCENT CHRISTMAS

Underneath the Christmas tree

WE CUT ROUND EXPECTANT PARENTS — AND AT ONE POINT CUT TO MRS
MONROE — FROM BENEATH HER DARK GLASSES TEARS FALL GENTLY DOWN
HER CHEEKS SHE DOESN’T WIPE THEM

All I want for Christmas is you

BOTH DANCING QUITE BADLY

AND THE PM QUITE CLOSE TO THE STAGE NOW PEERS THROUGH THE
WINGS AMAZED AT THIS PHENOMENAL GIRL — ALTHOUGH WHEN SOMEONE
APPROACHES HE TRIES TO HIDE AND FADE INTO THE BACKGROUND —
STILL WORKING HARD NOT TO BE SEEN HE BACKS UP INTO NATALIE —
AND IN THE DARKNESS THEIR LIPS COME TOGETHER

JOANNA (CONTD)
I ‘don’ t want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don’t care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don’t need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won’t make me happy with a toy
on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my dreams come true -
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

FINALLY JOANNA POINTS ON ‘ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU IS
YOU’ — AND AT ONE POINT SHE POINTS AND STARES STRAIGHT AT SAM
IT IS THE MOMENT WE’ VE BEEN WAITING FOR BUT THEN - SHE MOVES
ON SAM’S HEAD DROPS - HIS DREAMS DEFEATED

HYSTERIA JUST BEFORE THE END — THE AUDIENCE EXPLODES INTO
APPLAUSE

meet Prince William then you can marry
him instead

foolish as me and of co-co-course I
prediction you say ‘no’ — but it’s

fateful cock-up would have it - here I am
mid-fifties and without knowing it I’ve
gone and spent most of my adult life with a
chubby employee And as much as it grieves
me to say it it might be that the people I
love is in fact you
