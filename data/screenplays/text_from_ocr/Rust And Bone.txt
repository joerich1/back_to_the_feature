1 THE CHILD

Gradually more and more visible in the darkness the face
of a child Sam He is 6 years old blond pale and
miserably thin As we move in on his eyes we see his lids
quickly contracting

Under his eyelids vestiges of the day’s lights and
shadows of the day’s noise

A grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can
knock a man off his feet

Ali’s face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon
sun

Ali and Sam look at the sea the beaches and hotels It’s

huge woman very tall with a pretty face She wears
leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse’s and a
pair of flip flops At the bottom of the bag Anna finds a

calling Richard on the way Ali hears Sam in the kennel
giggling in delight

He looks around the seedy garden a metal shed leaning to
one side what’s left of an engine an old orange Special

50 moped plastic junk etc

Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop pretending to
be interested in cameras Through the shop window he can
see Sam waiting outside in the sun

15 EXT ANTIBES STREETS DAY

Suddenly Sam sees his father run out of the shop trying
to shake a security guard hot on his tail Sam watches them

disappear into a tiny lane

Sam looks around a bit frightened
Farther off in a busy shopping district

Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists The security
guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a
wall They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath

SECURITY GUARD
Unzip your jacket Empty your pockets

Ali keeps his cool

ALI
Unzip it yourself

Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly The
guard tries to punch him Ali dodges

The guard hesitates a moment until Ali lets fly a right
hook The guard stumbles A kick in the face sends him
flying into a stall Ali lifts his arms in victory for the
benefit of the few stunned passersby He kisses his own
biceps does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off

16 EXT ANTIBES STREETS DAY

Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the
terraces and ice-cream stores looking for his father

Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot
where they had left it chained up He walks toward it A

voice calls out

ALI
Hey Here I am

Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who
is sniffling tears in his eyes

ALI
No need to cry I wouldnt have left you all

of a killer whale Stephanie posing with a group of young
people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo

It’s as if Ali’s calm peremptory tone suddenly let Simon
know who he was dealing with

SIMON
Yes but

ALI

SIMON
Nothing forget it

In one second Stéphanie sees Simon’s face undergo a
metamorphosis his nervous authority suddenly disappear
She glances at Ali as if to say ‘Please go now’

26 INT MARINELAND TRAINERS’ OFFICE DAY

Two rooms adjoining the locker room Two desks and on the
walls pictures of the trainers with their orcas laminated
posters of various training methods files for each animal
Stephanie is in her diving suit sitting in front of
Louise a 23-year-old woman who is reading a document about

her internship

A trainer leaves the locker room his backpack slung over
his shoulder

TRAINER
Coming

No answer Tension He leaves without a word

Louise looks up She has been crying Stephanie looks at
her impassive Louise swallows her tears

LOUISE
Really this isnt fair
STEPHANIE

No Louise there are lots of things you can
say but not that The pools are my
responsibility and all I care about are the
animals I have to see to their environment
and that starts with their trainers Do you
understand

LOUISE
What are you trying to make me believe that
I wasnt up to par

STEPHANIE
No listen

LOUISE
Lacking in maturity Skills

STEPHANIE

Youre not consistent Weve already
discussed that The foundation of the
relationship with the orcas is stability
During your internship youve had your ups
and downs Its not your competence that

LOUISE

You know this has nothing to do with my
internship You couldn’t care less if I was
competent or not It has to do with that I
fucked Michael Just say so

STEPHANIE
Oh please

LOUISE

And in fact what really bothers you is not
that we fucked but that he told me about
you How you think youre so How youve
become such a bitch Thats why youre
firing me Thats what you should write in
your report

STEPHANIE
Okay are you done We can stop here No
need to spoil the rest of your internship

Louise stands up

27 EXT MARINELAND POOL — DAY

The empty stadium above the pool The trainers walk along
the gangplanks busily

In her diving suit Stephanie leans over the beach of
pool 3 She taps on the surface of the water A wave
forms whirling around the pool

The whale washes up on the beach beside her She performs
what looks like a daily ritual She examines the whale
caresses it The whale responds with uncanny gurgles

28 EXT MARINELAND DAY

Stock shots of a show at Marineland or images which we
will film to resemble stock shots wide-angle shots from
the stadium

The sound equipment blares Jump by Van Halen orcas shoot
out of the water the audience applauds Little kids clutch
electric-blue dolphin balloons getting splashed by the
orcas Images of the show are relayed on giant video
screens orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic
protective wall in front of the main pool etc

Cut to
29 INT MARINELAND POOL DAY

All at once silence Then surface noise but muted by the
cubic meters of water

Underwater shots from pool number 3

Overhead the surface shines like a mirror In pool number
3 a five-ton black shadow bides its time it is Niska

Behind the grate in pool number 3 Niska watches her mates
diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles

A mechanical creak then the grate slowly begins to lift
It’s about to be her turn

Niska swims into the big pool slowly at first but then
picks up speed She surfaces disappears for a long beat
then again reappears churning up a whirlpool of bubbles
On the other side of the mirror the music blares and the
crowd cheers

What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into
the pool We recognize Stéphanie She caresses Niska’s
rostrum then kisses it hanging onto her fins waltzing
with her up to the surface Her hands look ridiculously
tiny on the huge black fins We see her face mirrored in
one of the orca’s huge black gentle eyes A liquid world
of greens and blues whirls around them

Now with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum
Stéphanie has Niska swim around the pool accelerating the
water pressure and speed The plastic wall rushes by a
rush of adrenaline clouds of sediment are lifted as if by
a gust of wind

A young male Tom joins Niska in pool number 1 Niska
immediately rushes him as if riled by the intrusion and
flattens him against the plastic wall

In the shifting reflections at the water’s surface we can
make out Stéphanie and two other trainers’ faces on the
‘beach’ Their palms beat on the water summoning the orcas
for their next number

Tom gathers some momentum then shoots around Niska to jump
into first place He disappears a moment then is back into
the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning

Niska then gets into place and takes a running start but
just as she is about to shoot out of the water Tom appears
out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him

We sense chaos up above Then we see Niska crash back into
the water with one after the other a piece of the huge
video screen that towered over the stage bits of scenery
and all kinds of random objects as if Niska had carried
away half the platform in her wake It all seems to fall
in slow motion like flecks of snow in a snow globe
Something sinks toward us a body floating weightless and
disjointed in a cloud of red

30 EXT MARINELAND - WHALE POOL DAY
Stéphanie is on the rim of the pool All around her the
audience panics a loudspeaker orders evacuation Louise

leans over her

STEPHANIE
What What happened

LOUISE
Tom and Niska They got in each others
way
Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving
suit She tries to find a pressure point

Stéphanie sees Louise’s face wet with tears

STEPHANIE
Stop it calm down Im fine

Her hand searches for something at thigh level without
finding it

She faints
31 EXT ROAD TO THE BEACH DAY

Ali is wearing his MP3 headset He runs down the road to
the beach sweat dripping into his eyes

32 EXT ANNA’S HOUSE DAY

Sam’s toys are lying scattered in the garden his half-
eaten snack is on the table Ali takes off his headset

ALI
Sam

No answer There is some noise over at the kennel He goes
and finds Sam in the kennel talking to the puppies

ALI
What are you doing here

Sam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel but Ali
reaches in and grabs him by the arm Sam is covered in mud
straw and dog shit

ALI
Youre gross You stink Whos taking care
of you

Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down The
water is freezing cold Sam hops from one foot to the other
and screams

SAM
Stop it Dad Its cold Stop

Sam shrieks An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee-
shirt comes out of a neighboring house Joelle the
neighbors’ daughter

ALI
Arent you supposed to be taking care of
him What the fuck are you up to

JOELLE
I was next doing the laundry

ALI
Take a look at him

JOELLE
Ill put him in the shower

ALI
(to Sam crying) Dont go in there Its
disgusting You hear

Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside

Ali is drawn to the living room when through the half-open
door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel

Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman he recognizes an inset
photo of Stéphanie the same he saw at her place riding on
the back of a killer whalel

Commentaire MSOffice1
Tl manque une phrase
JOELLE
There was an accident at Marineland

Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen

ALI
I know her

Sam pulls off his towel He watches his father who is
riveted to the screen glued to the looping footage of the
accident

33 INT HOSPITAL — NURSES’ LOUNGE NIGHT

Silence

The silence of an on-duty nurses’ lounge a table a
microwave on a mini-fridge and Louise standing by the

window sipping coffee

She is wearing a fleece jacket her hair messily pulled
back She hasn’t had any sleep

She hears a scream She rushes into the corridor
34 INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

Chaos Louise rushes into the room She finds Stéphanie
crawling on the floor dragging her IVs

She hesitates overwhelmed then calls for help

LOUISE
Help Help Please

On the linoleum two stumps stick out of Stéphanie’s
nightshirt two thick bandages surround her thighs that

look like two wrapped hams

STEPHANIE
My legs What did you do with my legs

Two nurses arrive
Stéphanie is back in bed the IVs in her arms Louise rocks

her gently Stéphanie’s eyes struggle against sleep She
wants to scream again but doesn’t have the strength She

falls asleep in Louise’s arms She feels eight years old

Black

35 INT HOSPITAL ROOM DAYNIGHT

always from the same POV

In the foreground looking our way is Stéphanie’s face

They are silent and look devastated They occasionally
speak to each other in whispers

Stéphanie closes her eyes

She sees the shadow and only the shadow of his opponent’s
fist barely miss Ali’s face

Then things speed up Ali uses his feet knees and fists
When his opponent begins to totter to one side Ali hangs
onto him like a pit bull When he falls Ali pounds on his
face with his fists and elbows The ‘ref’ has to enlist
Cousin’s help to pull Ali away

Ali returns to his place in the car Stéphanie looks at
him he can’t sit still

ALI
I have to go

Another combat begins while Ali jogs around the hangar

Stéphanie watches other combats whether featuring Ali or
not

She sees feet dancing on the concrete

She sees the banknotes in people’

s hands

She sees heads leaning over balconies

She sees an opponent’s fist hit Ali behind the ear

She sees another of Ali’s opponents get back to his feet
and Alis fist split open his nose like a ripe fig

She sees another opponent’s head

She sees a tooth roll across the
crap game

She sees Ali perform three steps
own biceps

blood and returns to the task at hand

Stéphanie is on automatic pilot When she turns to the
room she feels the blond guy’s eyes locked onto her She
can pretty much tell what he’s thinking about the breasts
under her T-shirt She answers his questions she returns
his smiles When she finishes her glass and puts it down on
the counter he kisses her She doesn’t push him away
immediately like a frightened virgin she takes the time
to put a good face on it

STEPHANIE

The guy looks disappointed then manages a ‘good loser’s’
smile

GUY

away

help the blond guy back to his feet There’s a deep gash on
his skull

forming over him

SAM

ALI
Shit

Ali rushes to the pond but Sam is already iced over He
kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole
Sam has disappeared Ali shoves aside snow He looks
everywhere but sees nothing And then he hears a noise
blows like signals coming from under the ice Ali crawls

over and clears away snow as best he can Under the ice he
sees Sam’s face staring wide-eyed

Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice like pistons
or pestles As if pounding on his punching bag

139 UNDER THE ICE DAY

father’s fists pound on the ice He sees bloodstains

The ice cracks a bloody fist searches the water for him

respirator his mouth spits out brackish water
brutally

A door opens and a nurse appears Ali straightens up

145 INT POLAND HOTEL ROOM DAY

A child sleeps

His eyes are darting under his eyelids vestiges of light
and shadow of noise

Sam opens his eyes he is in a hotel room At the foot of
the bed a TV with the sound turned down low is

broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in Polish

Stéphanie comes and goes picking up things littering the
floor and packing their bags

Over these images we hear Ali’s voice

The human hand contains 27 bones Some
monkeys have more gorillas have 32 five in

each thumb For humans its 27

If you break an arm or a leg after a while
calcium gathers around the bone and joins it
together In the end its stronger than
before But if you break a bone in your
hand you know itll never fully heal
Youll think about it before every fight
Youll pay attention And even if you pay
attention the pain will come back like
needles like broken glass

Ali is wearing a T-shirt He still bears the marks of
yesterday’s fight His eyebrows and hands are bandaged

ALI
Wake up kiddo Its over Were going home

SAM

bandaged He is being interviewed along with a kind of
Viking with a closed eye and broken arm

Ali goes to join Stéphanie and Sam outside the hotel where
a taxi driver is loading their luggage A young Polish fan
calls out Ali Ali He wants a photo
