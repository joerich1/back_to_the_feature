Tonight He Comes

FADE IN Cc

BLACK Its everywhere It swallows the screen And so we stare
into a sea of BLACK

NARRATOR (V0)
I saw a severed head once Except for the
paleness it looked healthy well-fed
The end came abruptly you could tell
‘cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence
Shh the curled lips attempted Like
it started saying shucks or Shirley
or shit happens Your eyes dont
forget things like that Like you dont
forget the sound animals make when
theyre humping Primal Raw They endure

after youve Succumbed to the la-la of
forgetfulness

(a pregnant beat)
Sometimes when its dark out so dark
its black Ill see HIM

(beat)
And it starts all over again

From this blackness a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky e
EXT SKY - NIGHT

We are in the eye of a STORM an angry mass of clouds ragin

g
across the black sky It brings RAIN and THUNDER and the swirl
of a howling WIND

An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness It flies t

hrough the
Weather and advances into our scope of visibility

A FLASH of lightning Srupts and it illuminates the sky We SEE
the approaching entity as it hovers before us

Its a man
Its a man plus

Its a SUPERHERO

garbed in an elastic ark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends
behind him thrashing against the wind and rain

This Superhero Unshaven Disheveled Worn A face
chiselled with mileage
C)

oO

In the eyes we can see his soul Intense Fierce An exposed
nerve snagged in a fish hook

- He hangs in the air tired rain-soaked pissed-off

He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood

And from the bowels of his very soul this Superhero belches a
thunderous ROAR He pivots in the air and dives toward land

He slices through the downpour arms extended body erect
engulfed in the dimensions of his cape

The ground approaches fast He accelerates as if to embrace it
Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT

An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface penetrating
the asphalt - head first Debris and concrete spew from the
ruptured orifice as he disappears inside

There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
down the street like loose change

The rain continues its onslaught
INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rain sloshes against a kitchen window Where the sink is Not
far from the kitchen table Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits
dinner before them

HORUS leans over his plate eating his meal Here idles a
man of diminutive frame bespectacled placid - as harmless as
low fat milk

He sits opposite MARY frenetically appropriating food A
gentle beauty entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
attitude

A meek little AARON slouches between the folks - a BLACK
EYE tattoos the left of his face Aaron stares at the damn
piate finding no humor in eggplant

MARY
The principal did nothing Like
schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
being tardy Whats the matter with
education Back when you could go to
school and learn about Betsy Ross and
mollusks and not get stabbed on the
way home

(MORE)
MARY (CONTD)
Its not Little House On the Prairie
anymore its a war zone out there ‘

HORUS
Were they local s80n

Aaron stares at the damn eggplant stoic

MARY
Local Horus this isa national
epidemic Whats the difference if its

HORUS
Youre upset

MARY
Of course Im upset Strangers are

beating up our only child and youre not
upset

Mary hands Aaron a KETCHUP bottle

MARY (CONTD)
(to Aaron)

Try this eo
(to Horus)
You cant just sit there ang let it

happen without having some kind of Strong
feelings about it

Aaron accepts the bottle Grimaces to wrench it open It pays no
heed to Prepubescent Power
MARY (CONTD)
(continuing)
Rage violent about this
She takes the bottle from Aaron Hands it to Horus He takes it
Taps it against table Napkin over Cap he Proceeds to unscrew

it - the Strength just isnt there

HORUS
Im not comfortable with violence

Mary scoffs such a thought Stabs the eggplant She glances
across the table at her husband

Horus battling the ketchup bottle Face bright red knuckles
white to the bone - like hes taking a constipated shit

Aaron watches this His father wrestling ketchup and losing

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp STEAM hisses from its

‘side and plumes into a wall of white mist

And from this cloud of angry vapors a figure appears He
surfaces from the dark subway tunnel a cool nonchalance in his
gait

‘It is the Superhero his identity safely concealed under the

collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT He traverses the loading deck
PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him

He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway He
strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE up against the grafetti-
raped subway wall

On the wall a line of profanity declares that
YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS
He surveys the machine His right arm appears from the coat

pocket Fingers merge into a tight fist And casually he rips
into the metal vendor like it was Jello

His fist withdraws a handful of bills coins He pockets the
loot He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE
Deposits it under his coat

And with that he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
above

At the ramp and on cue the subway tram closes its doors
Trembles Moves Steams into the deep dark tunnel White SMOKE
mushrooms from its tail It lingers in the air as we

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT
see STEAM rising from a faucet of running HOT water

It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
another set of pots Shes clearing the table

t
Down a dark hallway a streak of light escapes from an open
door Inside and on the bed the frail posture of Horus changes
out of his clothes

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs He stands before

the closet mirror scrutinizing the emaciated sand-kicked-in-
the-face body
Horus strikes a He-man pose his biceps flapping in the wind VY

He retrieves a dry-cleaneg ONIFORM from the Closet Its official
tailoring and cut Suggests Standard issue Police apparel

He removes the Plastic Proceeds to Put it on
EXT STREET - NIGHT

The rain Continues its assault The Sky groans for more And a
FLASH of lightning joins the fray

The Superhero he walks the empty streets He crosses to a motel
the RED Eyr MOTEL Says the blinking neon sign

He enters the building
INT RED EYE MOTEL NIGHT

‘If the lobby is any indication this place isa large yeast
infection Damp urine-colored Carpeting accompany rotted
furniture and Peeling wallpaper

a PROSTITUTE drapes across a bench too tired to remove 4

Cigarette butt from her mouth Her PIMp orchestrates a deal ata
nearby pay Phone

The Superhero strolls through the lobby drenched like a wet
Tag Makes for the check-in CAGE

Behind the cage the Oily head of a MAN Stares back at him He
is bent over a Magazine Picking his nose

The Superhero Watches him Waits He taps a BELL - RING
The man Continues Picking
Again - RING And again - RING

MAN
Shit

The man chucks the Magazine Wipes his finger between his
armpits Turns This Pale mangy fungus is FISH C)

C)

His blood-shot eyes mean it
Fish turns to the back wall Grabs a random KEY from a nail

FISH
Top floor 7F Fifteen a pop up front
(re the check-in sheet)
And your John Hancock makes it sweet

The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet Scribbles
HANCOCK
on the dotted line

Fish hands over the key Then pulls it back from Hancocks
grab

FISH (CONTD)
I dont take messages I dont do favors
and I dont know you from Jack You want
sheets theyre extra Towels extra
Plungers extra

HANCOCK
I need quiet Is it quiet

FISH

Quiet Hey pal we look like a public
library to you The girls work Some of
them scream some of them moan

(smiles)
‘s and some of them just kinda lay there
cold You want quiet I got cotton balls
you can stick in your ear Theyre extra

Hancock eyes Fish mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
hands He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot Pushes it
under the window

And while Fish collects he leans into the window and emits a
deep GROWL Fish recoils The bills fly

Hancock takes the key Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
strangulated remains of the bell It rolls out of his palm and
CLINKS off the counter

Hancock sidles off Fish - the cats got his tongue

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Horus in full uniform dark blue pants shirt
He dips into a dresser pulls out a thick black leather belt -
complete with holster

Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - Its obscured
by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal

He confronts the mirror twirls this piece holsters it And we
SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT

A shoulder patch reads

U-RENT SECURITY CO

Their motto TO OBSERVE AND RECORD

Horus tucks a hat under his arms ready to move
INT AARONS ROOM - NIGHT

A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge Outside
is rain

the story
On a bed sprawled on his back Aaron gazes up at the empty
ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face

Aaron brings his hand before his eyes Looks at it
Slowly his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a b
interpretation of a mans weapon

Studies it

A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles Horus peers in

HORUS
Hows the eye

AARON

Horus enters
Stands awkwardly before his son
HORUS
Itll be gone in a week Momll touch it

up with some make-up and you wont even
know its there

AARON
Yeah I will And I dont want any girly
make-up on my face

Horus deposits himself on the bed Hunches over-his knees

HORUS
(almost apologetically)
Therell always be people around
wholl exert force over those of us
who just want to live in peace

Aaron listens observing his fathers efforts

HORUS (CONTD)

(pain in every word)
The thing to do is to avoid them
Theyre no-wins Cant-wins You hold the
anger and move on You hold the anger

(turns to Aaron)
I tell you because I cant take it
seeing you hurt Youre part of me

(beat)
Ive felt what youre feeling now And if
youve got any of me in you youre gonna
feel what I felt when you go up against
one of ‘em Turn away thats what you
do the other cheek You do that for
me No youre not the coward Not you
No Ill be the coward all right Cause
I dont want to see you hurt I love you
I ask you to do that for me your old
man

And while he utters these words Mary watches from the dark
hallway - moved by his affection

She oversees a father-son embrace
HORUS (CONTD)
Im late for work Get some sleep
Tomorrow always feels better

AARON
after a good night sleep

The light FLICKS off and the mans silhouette form exits the

He squats on the TOILET pants around the ankles cape shrouded
around him

Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen a cigarette

We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy

An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts

A bed unslept The TV is on commercialing some spring-fresh
vaginal wash The room sits empty

But the bathroom door is open Inside the supersuit peeled down
to his waist Hancock shaves

continues in Angola as rebel forces

The SOUND of machine guns CRACKLE amidst mortar explosions and
civil destruction

Hancock listens - it disturbs him He whirls around accosts the

EXT ROOFTOP - DAY
On the rooftop the Red Eye Motel

A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back only We

cigarette He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood ever so
still

Something brews within this superman

The schoolyard - it looms in the background as a reference to
where we are

Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
fire-escapes and ominous gray skies DARK FIGURES move into this
sight - they eclipse the heavens

And there Aaron is twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
- his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
and ERLICK (both his age)

Aarons face another BLACK EYE makes it a set Rage distorts

his mouth out of symmetry He stares at PERCEVAL before him
the blonde kid from class

We HEAR water a stream of liguid-something SPLASHING about
SPRAYING Perceval - hes taking a leak on Aarons exposed leg

EXT BANK - DAY
The aftermath
Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS reporters squeezing

through a wall of people police trying to get a piece of this

The baby teeters along the edge It heads for a FLAG pole
dazzled by the red-white-and-blue It reaches out at fabric
Almost Not quite The baby DROPS from the precipice

On the street people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
the infant down

But wait Hancock swoops out of the thin blue swift and
silent He cradles the baby from utter concrete

He deposits the youngster with the ecstatic crowd - they of
mostly the FEMALE persuasion all form around the savior

More intense it becomes

And then a high-pitch GASP Two individuals man and woman

Theyre locked at the hips pumping away like high-revving

For a second light dances off the womans aroused face its

Oh god

The man surfaces from her cleavage for air his face wet with

solitude

He reaches behind his belt and withdraws a box of cigarettes
Taps himself a stick

VOICE (0S)
How about spreading some of that joy

Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM scraggly in his own
slimy kind of way

In a huff he shoves Hancock up against the building Presses a
gun to Hancocks temple

HOODLUM
(psychotic)
Better yet why dont I just take it

Hancock - enraged In a caffeinated blink he has the Hoodlum by
the throat via one arm the gun with the other

HANCOCK
(super-psychotic)
What are you thinking

The Hoodlum notices that hes dangling a foot off the ground -
one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt

The other sneaker teeters on his one foot and falls to the
pavement

HOODLUM

Shit

HANCOCK
What are you thinking

Hancock wrests the gun from his hand Places it into his own
mouth FIRES two slugs inside The Hoodlum FREAKS

Hancock stumbles out incognito frazzled under his guise Up
above the sky - so dark under the storm clouds

We HEAR commotion in the side alley And so does Hancock He
peers into the alley

There by a lighted PHONE BOOTH a WHORE is fending off a horny
JOHN Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
legs He drops SQUEALS like a little girl

The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt He reaches for it

wd

A COUGH stops him - its Hancock and he discourages further
violence

Up and out of the alley the John flees - tail between his
legs

A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore looking into each
others eyes for answers

The Whore approaches him Touches his face - Studies it Moves
it into the light

WHORE

against the building glazed over with drunkenness

INT WATANABES SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not
unlike a cemetery

All is dead with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing
linoleum Its Horus on duty His flashlight leads the way

Outside the SIRENS of police vehicles charge by - real men en
route to real work

Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who cant come
out to play

He turns to look across the floor - Roheim against a chair
watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV

Its dark out here in the night On the roof Overlooking the
community the Longfellows apartment building and Marys

disrobes down to bare back

And from this darkness the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS
into view Hancock watches from here the cigarette BLAZES back
towards his face intense

EXT SOMEWHERE - NIGHT DREAM SEQUENCE
A foreign TERRAIN of trees of lakes so clear and blue
They pass below us as we soar through air and mist

the mist clears thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
JUNGLE We penetrate the silence

» the silence it fades into SONG - the silk mellifluous
voice of a woman (not unlike Marys) Her siren call beckons
us takes us deeper into unknown greenery

but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to
song SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke women and children
in hysterics

A

we quicken to a frantic pace slicing through the growth
Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path splitting trees
and earth

we remain undaunted but the WAILS of suffering
continues

- until we get there there in a clearing as smoke and debris
settle and we see the remains of a lake alake full of
BLOOD of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam WOMEN and
CHILDREN DEAD

» we SCREAM
INT RED EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified eyes cracked with red
veins He is soaked

The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the
adjacent motel room - the wall behind Hancocks bed trembles to
the rhythm of each pelvic thrust

He clasps his ears - tormented

world to himself

‘He crosses the street failing to look both ways BAH A UPS
truck STRIKES the clueless superhero sending him across air -
towards Mary

200 lbs of superflesh EXPLODES into a JEWELRY display window -
just ahead of Marys path Glass showers the scene People
SCREAM

Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to
mere tatters He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble Looks
at Mary reposed before him

HANCOCK

How are you

In unison they turn to the UPS vehicle - a mangled heap of
steel STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator

Hancock shrugs a smiles

and his face shows it

There to make it worse - Clyde Hes back getting at the sports

Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a
cool stroll Mary holds his trenchcoat surveying the damage

Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one
MARY (CONTD)
(continuing)
Are you okay

No reply He stares at her - simply

EXT STREET - DAY

Mary stands alone on the sidewalk looking up at heaven Her

eyes search the gray sky for signs of life -

There overhead - a DOT It grows in size getting closer and
arriving fast and gradually it shapes into Hancock

He swoops into view straight downward Pulls on the air brakes
and eases into a soft landing - by Marys side

He is wet from his flight and his hands we notice are cupped
together tightly

MARY
(like a little girl)
Lets see

HANCOCK
You have to be quick

MARY
Come on I want to see

HANCOCK
If you blink youll miss it

Hancock uncups his hands releasing a billowy MASS of white
something - it hangs in the air and then dissipates into
moisture It showers into his open hands

Mary reaches for it Too late

MARY
I saw it right A little cloud

She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains
And with her fingers Mary reaches inside to feel the rain

Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face as her hand
touches his

He stares down at her hand at the wedding ring Mary pulls
her hand away

MARY (CONTD)
The water is dirty

HANCOCK
It is

MARY
It is

HANCOCK

Im sorry

MARY
(into his eyes)
Its not your fault

Hancock looks away

MARY (CONTD)

Youre tense

HANCOCK
Ive been tired lately

MARY
You should slow down Rest

HANCOCK

‘So people tell me

MARY
(heat upon some thought)
It must be hard

HANCOCK
Hard

MARY
To always do right do good when all
you want to do is rest

HANCOCK
Its harder to not do anything What am
I Its not for me Its for it is
about people Rest When there is
despair I cannot I bring relief I am
relief You know that instant that split
instant of time when you realize that the
nightmare the totality of fear
itself that its all been a bad dream
That its safe That is relief The
infant in my arms to the hysterical
mother When you can see her face whats
rest It is self-indulgence

Mary - in some advance stage of wow

MARY
Where who are you

HANCOCK
Its not important who I am Mary Or
what where Im from It doesnt
matter Im aman I am every man

MARY
(sizing up his words)

You probably get a lot of practice

explaining yourself on account of who

you are and what you do

HANCOCK
Why do you say that

MARY

Its like everything you say sounds
so perfect Like you rehearse them so
theyll be that way I mean not to say
that its insincere

(beat)
I mean maybe its something about you
but it must be hard on you sometimes

Hancock stares at his feet perhaps reluctant to answer

MARY (CONTD)
(apologetic)
But probably not probably

HANCOCK
Yes
(pulling teeth)
sometimes w

Mary allows the moment to sink in

MARY
So you never answered Back there

He cuts into an alley Looses them momentarily Finds a DUMPSTER

Erlick Spengler They zoom by and with great eagerness
Perceval strolls after them too cool to sweat

From the dumpster little Aaron watches them looks
relieved until conscience kicks in A moment to reflect he
takes

before long youre running looking
for a place to hide

EXT ALLEY - DAY

Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end Their trail leads them to a

Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick landing on the other
side Spengler pulls himself over Joins Erlick on the ground

PERCEVAL

Erlick and Spengler turn to him through the metal bars Their
eyes are of disbelief

PERCEVAL (CONTD)

Perceval follows their gaze behind him - to Aaron shivering
with clenched fists

PERCEVAL (CONTD)
(rolls up sleeves)
I just combed my hair

Erlick and Spengler make for the fence to join the fray

PERCEVAL (CONTD)

And the pummeling begins Perceval dictates the assault landing
BLOWS to the face and body

Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag He wafts at air
left and right

ERLICK
Hes yours

SPENGLER
Save some for us

Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt supine
Perceval looms over him silhouetted against the sky

He reaches for his zipper doing that Perceval-thing A look of
recognition in Aarons eyes - its going to rain soon

He reacts with knee-jerk reflects administering a swift kick
into Percevals peeing apparatus A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
fellows mouth He drops like a wet tea bag

Erlick Spengler Shock Disbelief Aaron gets to his feet
ready to book but he doesnt He stays

ERLICK
Whats he doing

SPENGLER
Kick his ass Percy

Aaron stares at them behind the fence Then down at Perceval
fetal position mouth agape Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP
revenge presents itself

ERLICK
Thats cold

oo SPENGLER
Kill him Percy

Aaron cranes himself over Percevals face over his open oral
orifice Contemplates his target

Aaron - to pee or not to pee
ZIP He closes his fly Steps away

He struts out of the alley Shifts into a mad sprint adrenaline
taking him away

EXT STREET - DAY

Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger
despair a combination thereof

He moves down his street Looks ahead - where Clyde stands
pillaging his morning Paper Clyde spots Horus on the approach
Smiles at him with impunity Goes back in

On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth
INT APARTMENT - DAY
Fist clenched the morning paper under his arm - Horus steadies

down the hallway His eyes target the door at the end of the
hall seeing red

He gets there the door He swallows Wipes sweat off his hand
KNOCK And again KNOCK

He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
second Until finally Horus is a pile of dung

The door opens

And Clyde emerges tall and ugly Hes holding up his pants with
one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other

Caught in mid-defecation he is none too happy

CLYDE
The box scores are waiting and I got an
inch of meat sticking out of my ass Make
it snappy

Without warning Horus wrests the sports page from Clydes arm -
a kamikaze move indeed

CLYDE (CONTD)
(shocked)
Give that back

Horus lunges at his hulking opponent lands a punch into Clydes
midsection Harmless it tickles him maybe

CLYDE (CONTD)
Whyd you go and do that for

Clyde belts up has pants Roles up his sleeves and the
massacre commences

He simply tears into Horus BLOWS to the stomach RIGHTS

‘across the face It ends quickly and without resistance - as if

Horus accepted it as fate

Clyde kneels over Picks up the sports page And as if yawning
returns to his room

couldnt dance so I sat in the back and
watched You were with Stuart Olmsted and
I watched you dance In your white dress
And I remember zoning out for a
second just watching you God Mary
the little girl next door who used to get
into fist fights with her brothers in
those patched-up Toughskins We met only
‘cause the tallest tree in the
neighborhood was in my backyard and you
needed to climb it

(beat)
But that night God you looked so
beautiful I had to realize it how much
I loved you one more time

(beat)
You and Stuart danced Laughed And I
remember Im watching you there with
him together like that You looked
good with him I thought all of a sudden
Like you belong better And as I
stared across the floor it was the same
story with all the guys there that they
were more right for you

(swallows)
More right because that night you walked
in with the wrong man

MARY
Why do you say that

HORUS

Because I let you down

(beat)
Im a coward I cant do anything about
it Look at me Im breaking up in front
of you And God I fear the day when Id
have to defend you and Aaron What do I
do then What am I if I cant do that
my own wife family Not a man

MARY

(pallistic)
Youre a fool thats what you are Did
you think I was completely blind when I
married you Something cuts at your
masculine ego and its the pressure
the standards unreasonable The woman
she wants me to part oceans Thats the
Kind of bull shits made of I went
through it I was there when the hurt
came when the academy said no I was
there And when you felt like hiding
from me and your own SON taking the U-
Rent job I stepped forward I was there
It was you Horus Longfellow Not me I
didnt take the love away Im still
here

Horus stands there tears almost He takes to the closet

retrieving his U-Rent Security jacket He grabs his security

in on Hancock ww

A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets
ricochet off the superhero with no effect

Cops and SWAT teams continue their assault - its the only
thing they can do and its worthless

And on that note Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance

First to go is the helicopter He slices through the air and
RIPS the vehicle in half

An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning
PROPELLER into wild trajectory It crashes into a cluster of
Cops - heads are severed sent flying

In the blink of an eye the police department is no more The
entire block - a panorama of bedlam overturned vehicles and
mangled bodies

Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building

From the street we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble
heading towards the confrontation He ‘passes a mutilated body -
belonging to Adams

A revolver dangles from his fingers Horus reaches for the gun
and stops He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes
that no revolver will do He continues forth

EXT KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

Horus stands there in the rain - a feeble frame of a man He
wants a fight

And he gets it as Hancock once again emerges from the
building - fire in his eyes —

HANCOCK
You ready to rock it up

Horus runs - he runs for an overturned SWAT VAN Hancock
follows toying with the man

Horus disappears inside

HANCOCK (CONTD)
Come out you little shit

A pause in action - no reply from Horus

HANCOCK (CONTD)
Are you a man

Horus answers

He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER

He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock Its a hit and it BLOWS
Hancock against Killybegs Textile It lodges him inside the
brick structure

HORUS
Fuck you

Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable He
GROWLS looking to retaliate But theres no Horus

Hancock explores the rubble - by the building A sudden
EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
loose sending it crashing down on Hancock

CRUNCH the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does

not subdue him He shakes off the dirt Finds Horus down the
street

Like a rocket Hancock heads that way He gets there over Horus
- grabbing him by the collar

With a swift flick he sends the family man flying

THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall He drops to the
asphalt below Horus - in pain something broken possibly

om He gets up Tries to walk Cant
Hancock - on the approach maintaining a cruel but steady pace VJ
towards his wounded game

Horus tries to crawl Cant Too much pain He peddles back
against the curb nowhere left to 90-

Hancock arrives looking fully steamed He stands over Horus -
not unlike Scarpo much earlier

The situation presents itself - he reacts

A kick into Hancocks groin muscle - CHINK like the sound of
pone off metal Absolutely harmless Horus simply shrugs What
else can he do

Hancock tears 4 YIELD street SIGN from its concrete base Raises
this piece of jagged metal Pulls it pack Ready to strike

HORUS (CONTD)
(defiant)
No regrets

HANCOCK
(cool)
No mercy

)

He takes aim

BARON (0S)
NO

Mary SCREAMS in the background

Horus Hancock They turn to witness the de-physicalization of
Killybegs Textile

Bricks beams they begin to crumble weakened by the wear
and tear of recent artillery

Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give It
slips she SCREAMS and collapses taking the rest of the
building with it

A CRASH followed by a cloud of billowing smoke

Mary is no more

pale

Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics trying to
excavate his wife - one brick at a time

Roheim meets him there in an effort to console
ROHEIM (0S)
(youre wasting your time)
Come on Horus
Horus - lost in the pain He wont listen

Slowly and with a sense of duty Roheim joins the excavation He
rolls up his sleeve and gets to work

Hancock drops the yield sign Turns to the battlefield in his
midst surveys the carnage

A loaded beat
Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation He grimaces with defeat
Staggers off SCREAMS because what else can he do Falls to his
knees
by fallen police GUN
He picks it up

- points it at his head

» FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple Bullets carom
off skull

Hancock discards the gun Breaks into TEARS Long SOBBING wet

tears He CRIES He WEEPS Into his cupped hands Indeed a
surreal sight

Horus Roheim Engaged to the task brick by brick Horus works
his way down to a lifeless ARM protruding from its tomb

He stops
