“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood but
against the rulers against the authorities against the
powers of the dark world and against the spiritual
forces of evilin the heavenly realms” Ephesians 612

The following is based on a true story

Fade in
On HORSE’S HOOVES pounding over a muddy dirt road
Widen to see -

They belong to a team of horses pulling a wagon At the
reins is JUDSON SHERMAN early twenties A ranch hand
around his same age ridés next to him By the way
they’re dressed and the style of the wagon were
somewhere in the late 1800s

Judson’s leading the team toward a two-story English
styled farm house with a covered porch in t é distance
Maple and Hickory trees tower around it Dull light
stabs out from several windows Smoke plumes from the
fireplace A large barn stands fifty yards away

Lightening cracks across a violent dark sky as sunrise
is just starting to break through the horizon Judson
pulls out a gold pocket watch Reads 515

As he puts his watch away he hears something Cocks his
head -- there it is again -- A BABY WAILING --but this
isn’t a “I’m hungry or tired cry” this is swelling
eruptions of excruciating pain

Judson cracks the reins hard -- the horses rear then
bolt like theyre shot out of a cannon kicking up mud as
they thunder faster to the house

The wails are almost more than Judson can take as he
drives the team right to the front door and reins back
hard hopping off the wagon before it comes to a halt
then --

-- just as he gets to the front porch -- the wailing
STOPS He doesn’t Moves to the front door Whips it
open A LARGE GREY CAT scrambles to get the hell out of
there Almost trips him as he heads in

INT FARMHOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Judson’s attention is immediately drawn to a living room
on his right where the shadows of flames from the
fireplace dance wickedly off the horrified look on his
face He just stares into it -- almost unable to
comprehend what he’s seeing Wood crackles

( )

As tears well he slowly moves deeper into the room --
it’s as if time has stood still for him

INT LIVING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

As he gets closer and closer to the fireplace the orange
of the fire gets brighter on his face e crackling
louder

He stops before the hearth then looks to his feet where
apair of long narrow knitting needles lie on the wood
floor in a puddle of blood He’s emotionally devastated

His peripheral vision picks up on something outside
moving quickly past a window

Rage fills his face He pivots Dashes back out the
front door where --

EXT FARMHOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

-- Judson leaps off the poreh and dashes by the ranch
hand who’s reigning in the horses that seem spooked He
picks up speed as he moves around the side of the house
where he sees a woman in a long grey dress bare feet and
lengthy jet black hair dashing into the barn and closing
the door behind her

Judson gets to the barn -- tries to open the door but it
wont budge He viciously pulls on the handle over and
over testing the lock and hinges -- then finally throws
his shoulder into it breaking it open

INT BARN - CONTINUOUS

Judson races in Stops and listens It’s cave dark --
the dawn light only penetrating the first few feet of the
opening Then --

-- just as he’s about to move in deeper the back-end of
a thick shovel swings out of the inky black and --

WHACK Hits Judson in the face --

SMASH CUT TO

SUPER - 1972
EXT FARMHOUSE - HARRISVILLE RHODE ISLAND - DAY

A1970s wood paneled station wagon with New Jersey
plates drives down a gravel driveway

ROGER (VO)
Here we are --

A hundred yards back now much older is the same two-
story farmhouse and barn Trees have grown It’s been
well cared for

The station wagon comes to a stop in front of the house
Getting out is the driver ROGER PERRON a lean man in
his early thirties and his wife CAROLYN whos simply
dressed with her hair pulled up -- also early thirties
Hopping out of the back are their two girls ANDREA and CINDY and the family’s black lab Sadie

Everyone is excited except for Cindy -- a mixture of
raging hormones and adolescence She takes in her
surroundings --

CINDY
Oh my God this place looks so
boring -- we’re like in the middle

of nowhere

As Andrea enthusiastically runs ahead to the porch Roger
turns to Carolyn --

ROGER
Do you hear that

She listens but --

CAROLYN
I don’t hear anything

A slow growing smile cracks across his face --

ROGER
Exactly

Carolyn looks over to open space between the house and
the barn --

CAROLYN
I see where I’m putting my garden

CUT TO

EXT FARMHOUSE - FRONT PORCH - RIGHT AFTER
Carolyn and the girls are next to Roger as he opens the
door Andrea dashes in
AN
I get first dibs on the rooms
Cindy looks to her dad as she enters --

CINDY
Do I get to pick my own room or
do I have no choice in that too

Roger’s eyes meet Carolyn’s -- who seems amused

CAROLYN
This is why some animals eat their
young

She gives Roger a quick kiss as she enters He playfully
slaps her on the butt

Roger turns to see Sadie standing several feet back
staring in through the open door There’s a deep
intensity behind her dark eyes -- her body rigid
Roger’s confused

ROGER
Cmon girl

Sadie takes a reserved step backwards Keeps staring

ROGER (contd)
Sadie c’mon --

The dog remains still -- has no intention of getting any
closer Roger lets it go

ROGER (contd)
Dumb dog

INT PERRON HOUSE - FOYER - AFTERNOON

Roger stands in the foyer which opens up to a hallway
that runs through the middle of the house A staircase
rises up one side There’s a kitchen to his left and the
living room to his right Boxes are everywhere It’s a
bee hive of activity Two burly MOVERS carefully
Maneuver a wooden gun case in through the front door

ROGER
That goes in the living room

They make the turn as another MOVER follows them in)
carrying a heavy box Roger reads something handwritten
across the top --

ROGER (contd)
Just put that down in the cellar

It’s the last door at the end of
the hall here

The guy continues on past him

DISSOLVE TO
INT PERRON KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

several knickknacks from a box Surroundin ass
cabinets are all open and already loaded with dishes

Carolyn stands at a counter next to a sink unpacking

A large oak table and chairs are set up in a nook with a
hutch tucked tight against a wall opposite it

Carolyn peels off packing paper from THREE WAX MONKEYS on
a wooden stand hands over eyes ears and mouth with a
written caption underneath “HEAR NO EVIL SEE No EVIL
SPEAK NO EVIL She sets it on a window lédge over the
sink

Andrea comes in carrying a HAND-MADE bird-feeder and
chain that only a mother could love

ANDREA
Can I hang up my bird feeder

CAROLYN
Of course I think I saw a hook
on the back porch
Andrea moves to a back door

CUT TO

EXT PERRON HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Andrea comes outside Bugs have already started to use
the porch light as a hub A low mist hangs above the
ground like a bad dream

She sees the hook her mom was talking about and carries
the feeder over to it

As she gets up on her tiptoes to hang it --
-- A HISS OF A VOICE CALLS HER NAME

VOICE
Andrea

She slowly turns her head -- can’t figure out where it’s
coming from as she scans the darkness

ANDREA
-Hello

No answer More confused than scared she hangs up the
bird feeder Then just as she’s about to head inside

she spots a large mang looking GREY CAT passing by the
bottom step of the porch -- it looks oddly similar to the
one in the opening

ANDREA (cont’d)
Oh hello

It continues walking She heads down the steps to catch
up
ANDREA (cont’d)

Where’d you come from C’mere
kitty

The cat walks around the corner of the house

CUT TO
Andrea’s pov - as she walks around the corner There’s
no cat She looks around for a place it could have gone
but there isn’t one Her expression says it all --
that’s weird

CUT TO

INT KITCHEN - BACK DOOR - RIGHT AFTER

Andrea comes back in just as Roger enters from the
hallway In passing --

ANDREA
Were you calling me
ROGER
No
As she walks away --
ANDREA
I think there’s a cat that lives

here

Andrea continues out of the kitchen as Roger comes up
behind Carolyn who’s unpacking a small clock Sets it
on the windowsill next to the monkeys

He slides his arms around her and kisses her neck -- she
likes it
CAROLYN
Careful -- this may turn into
something fun
ROGER
--If only I had the energy

(beat
I was thinking about running into
town and grabbing a pizza at that
place we passed

CAROLYN
That’d be great

She turns and faces him Loves this man dearly

CAROLYN (contd)
Thank you for this
eat)
I know it was a lot for us to chew
off but it’s going to be great
isn’t it --

ROGER
Yeah -- it is

DISSOLVE TO
INT PERRON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

A matching bedroom set has been set up Numerous boxes
are stacked and waiting to be unpacked as --

-- Carolyn pulls some clothes from a wardrobe box at the

foot of her bed and walks them into --

THE CLOSET

Just as she begins to hang them up -- the noise of
CREAKING WOOD draws her attention to the ceiling -- where
it sounds like someone’s trying to walk quietly -- then
it stops

She’s a little unnerved -- walks back out into

THE BEDROOM

and crosses to a nearby window Looks out to a tree its
leaves rustling in the wind She cranes her head to see
if any of the branches are touching the roof above the
closet Can’t tell

Just as she’s about to turn away r she notices Sadie down
in the yard near the front porch below nervously pacing
back and forth

ROGER OC
I don’t know what her problem is
I’ve tried ten times to get her to
come inside

She turns sees Roger setting a box down amongst the
others

ROGER
Last box for tonight I’m beat

CAROLYN
We can’t just leave her out there
she might run away

ROGER
I’ll find something to tether her
to Maybe a night outside will
help change her mind

As Roger heads back out --

CAROLYN
You weren’t just on the roof were
you
He turns around -- huh

CAROLYN (contd)
I heard something sounded like
footsteps

ROGER
It’s an old house honey it’s
going to make some noises

The lights flicker for a moment --

ROGER (contd)
--Oh great

CAROLYN
Maybe grab a flashlight too --

Roger heads out

DISSOLVE TO

INT MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Carolyn’s eyes open -- she’s awakened to what sounds like
the distant screams of hundreds of children -- but that
can’t be right She glances to Roger who is sound
asleep She slips out of bed to investigate

CUT TO

EXT HOUSE - BACK PORCH - RIGHT AFTER

Carolyn comes out the back door Listens -- it’s much
louder Her attention is drawn to the woods directly
behind the house where the screaming is coming from

A HAND touches her shoulder -- she about pumps out of her
skin She whirls Roger is standing right behind her

ROGER
Whoa -- sorry

Carolyn slowly turns back around to face the woods

CAROLYN
What is that
ROGER
(amused )
Tree frogs -- about as big as

softballs They’re fucking
She looks back at him over her shoulder --

CAROLYN
And you know this because

ROGER
I used to catch them as a kid at
my Grand-dad’s
Carolyn looks back out into the night

CAROLYN
Sounds like some pretty rough sex

Roger playfully pulls her into an embrace --

ROGER
I think it’s going to take some
time for this city girl to get
used to this country living

CAROLYN
I think you’re right

She snuggles up --
CAROLYN (contd)
(cov)
You still too tired

ROGER
Those frogs make you horny

CAROLYN
No -- you do

As they head in Carolyn’s gaze drifts back over her
shoulder one more time into the darkness -- still
slightly uneasy

CUT TO

EXT HOUSE - LATER

Clouds have moved in swallowing any illumination from

the moon and stars giving the house an ill-boding
resence The frogs have stopped replaced by a
ingering unholy silence

DISSOLVE TO

INT HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

Carolyn wearing a robe comes out of the bedroom —- side
steps a few boxes Morning light streaks in through
several windows illuminating the fact that the Perrons
are far from being unpacked

The bathroom door opens and Cindy sticks her head out --
CINDY

Do you think maybe we could’ve
bought a house that has a toilet

that works --
CAROLYN
Tell your dad
As Carolyn walks away --
CINDY

And there was this really funky
smell in my bedroom last night --
like something died

CAROLYN
Is it there now
CINDY
No
CAROLYN

Problem solved

Cindy rolls her eyes then retreats back into the

Carolyn crosses to a packing box on the counter Digs a
kettle out of it She moves to the sink and as she turns
on the water to fill it --

-- she freezes On the window ledge before her are --

-- The THREE WAX MONKEYS -- but instead of being lined up
in a row like they were before they are now facing each
other -- their heads all melted into one like some
deformed creature

She then notices that the small clock she put next to
them has stopped at 515 as well --

ANDREA 0C
Mommy where’s Sadie

Carolyn turns to see Andrea standing at the kitchen door
CAROLYN
She’s out front Why don’t you
see if she’ll come in She’s got
to be hungry

Andrea tears out of the kitchen dodging Roger as he
enters

ROGER
Slow down there kiddo

He looks to Carolyn standing at the sink -- knows
something’s up

ROGER (contd)
What is it

She steps aside showing him the monkeys As Roger
approaches --

ROGER (cont’d)
--Damn Is the ledge hot

CAROLYN
(a little spooked)
Not at all

And look at the clock -- it

in the hall

CUT TO

EXT FRONT OF HOUSE - SAME

Andrea comes out of the front door She sees an iron
post pounded into the ground with a chain snaking off it
Sadie’s tail is visible but a full view of her is hidden
by a bush at the bottom of the stairs

ANDREA
Sadie --

The tail remains motionless

ANDREA (cont’d)
Wake up girl --

Andrea takes a step down to the next She claps her
hands together --

ANDREA (contd
C’mon girl -- time for breakfast

There’s still no response --

Andrea comes down off the last step -- she blanches Her
little lips start to tremble at what she sees --

-- Sadie lies dead on the ground the chain wrapped
around her body like an Anaconda -- her tongue protrudes
limp her eyes are dull white

Off Andrea’s scream --

ED (VO
Fear is defined as a feeling of
agitation and anxiety caused by

(beat)
Take Maurice here --

INT LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

ED and LORRAINE WARREN (early thirties) are up on a stage
standing behind a podium An audience of three hundred
captivated college students are seated before them as
rough film footage rolls ona LARGE SCREEN of a
echoes looking man rail thin late 20’s sitting in
air His eyes are black matching his hair His
skin is pasty white A Catholic priest is next to him
reciting Latin from a bible in barely audible words

ED

-- He was a French Canadian farmer
with nothing more than a third
grade education -- yet after being
possessed by a demon spoke some
of the best Latin I had ever heard
-- sometimes backwards He had
been molested by his father who
also exposed him to bestiality

beat)
Evil found its home in this man
because he was conflicted and
forced into this -- he never had a
choice

(beat)
He thought he was saving his wife
by shooting her -- like his father
did to his mother

LORRAINE
If you look at his eyes you can
see them tearing blood onto his
shirt

Maurice’s white T-shirt slowly starts to get blotted with
drips of blood dark crimson red He suddenly SCREAMS
OUT IN PAIN his body writhing --

LORRAINE (contd)
And upside down crosses started
appearing on his body

We see Ed lifting up the side of Maurice’s shirt
exposing for the camera --

-- TWO UPSIDE DOWN CROSSES pushing OUT at his skin from
the inside Camera closes in

The audience can’t believe what they’re seeing

ED
That’s good Jerome why don’t you
hit the lights --

As the house lights kick back on we see JEROME DAVIS
(20s) Ed and Lorraine’s technigal assistant standing in
the back of the lecture hall He has longish hair wears
cords and a flannel shirt A leather necklace with peace
sign is draped around his neck He turns the projector

TIME CUT TO

Ed and Lorraine are in the middle of a Q and A with the
audience A male student with a tie-dyed shirt and wild
Afro is standing up --

LORRAINE
-- We investigate roughly a
hundred or so cases a year

AFRO
Cool Thanks

As Afro takes a seat hands go up Ed points to another
student who wears GLASSES four rows back He gets to his
feet

GLASSES
This is some creepy shit you two
do for a living --

Subtle laughs escape from the crowd

GLASSES (contd)
So how do you keep these things
from going after you

We don’t ple” personally involved
with people we’re working with or
what we’re motionaliy va -- it
makes you emotionally vulnerable
which gives them a way in And of
course our faith in God

He sits back down Hands fly up again -- Lorraine points
to a female student with a PONYTAIL in the front row who
gets to her feet She seems a little hesitant to speak
then --

PONYTAIL
I wake up at night sometimes
and it feels like someone’s laying
next to me Have you ever dealt
with anything like that before

LORRAINE
Many times
(beat)
Does it scare you

PONYTAIL
I’m a little freaked yeah

LORRAINE
Freaked is normal do you feel
threatened

PONYTAIL
--Not really It’s just weird

LORRAINE

(gentle)
Come here for a sec --

Lorraine moves up to the edge of the stage joining the
girl who does the same

LORRAINE (contd)
Give me your hands

The girl offers them to her Lorraine takes hold then
closes her eyes A moment later --

LORRAINE (contd)
The bed you sleep in belonged to
your Grandmother didn’t it

PONYTAIL
(amazed)
Yeah
LORRAINE
And you were very close before she
died

Ponytail is getting blown away --

PONYTAIL
She raised me

Lorraine opens her eyes --

LORRAINE
It’s her

Ponytail’s eyes well as she tries to contain her
emotions

LORRAINE (contd)
You need to let her know that
youre okay so she can move on
She still worries about you

PONYTAIL
How do I do that

With a gentle smile

LORRAINE
Next time you have that feeling
tell her

Lorraine lets go of her hands As Ponytail sits back
down Ed nods to another male student in the front row
Wears a beanie

GLASSES
Id love to know what scares you
the most

Ed cracks a small smile --
ED
Being married to a clairvoyant --
there’s not a whole lot I can get
away with

The crowd laughs

EXT AUDITORIUM - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jerome slides open the side door of a VW van There’s a
sticker on the window that reads “When this van’s a

next to’ an array of other electronic equipment then --

-- turns to Ed and Lorraine who are about to get into a
Plymouth parked right next to him

ED
So you feel like Chinese
He looks at them with a cocky grin --

JEROME OC
I hate to bail on you but I think
I’m going to do some “tutoring”

Ed and Lorraine are slightly confused until -- Jerome
turns and smiles at a young woman approaching them It’s
the Pony Tail girl

Ed lets an amused laugh escape his lips as he gets into
the car

It’s late Carolyn has a basket of laundry tucked under
her arm as she heads down the hallway toward her room at
the end

She stops at the closed bathroom door which has a phone
cord running across the floor from Cindy’s room into it

CINDY OC
« School basically sucks

Carolyn just sighs as she opens the door Sees Cindy

two different colors of eye shadow closing one eye at a
time --

She closes the door

CUT TO

INT ANDREA’S ROOM - SAME

Paper butterflies adorn her walls Stuffed animals line
a small shelf above a vanity mirror and dresser An Easy
Bake oven and Barbie play-set are lined up neatly against
a wall

Andrea is under her covers in a frilly four posted bed
head propped slightly by a pillow as she reads a book A
lamp on a nightstand next to her cascades a four foot
radius of light

Her body tightens as she catches a quick glimpse of
something furry jumping onto her be but her book has
obscured a full view --

-- she slowly lowers it to get a better look -- finds the
cat she saw earlier standing on the foot of her bed
It’s looking right at her

ANDREA
How’d you get in here

As she sits upright the cat scurries off the bed and out
of her room into the hallway --

Andrea scrambles out from under the covers and quickly
follows She looks out her door in time to see the cat
slip into Cindy’s room just down the hall

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

As Andrea moves to Cindy’s room she can hear her sister
still talking on the phone in the bathroom Her mom is

folding clothes on the bed in the master bedroom at the

end unaware of her presence

INT CINDY’S ROOM - RIGHT AFTER

Andrea stands in the doorway looking to see where the cat
went Her face is hit by a PURPLE HUE cascading from a
BLACKLIGHT hanging above a bed posters of The Jackson
Five peace signs and Alice in Wonderland all glow from
the fight Scattered clothes litter the floor The
bed’s unmade

Andrea can’t see the cat anywhere then she hears it
HISSING from under the bed

ANDREA
What’s wrong Kitty

Andrea comes into the room and over to the bed

She kneels As she looks underneath her eyes
immediately fall upon a Raggedy An Anne doll -- seemingly
staring at her -- scares her slig ly The hissing
starts up again but she can’t ae where the cat is as
her vision is obscured by other dolls stuffed under the
e

She reaches in and moves a couple aside -- sees the cat
but her breath gets caught in her throat --

-- the blacklight has made its eyes look wild almost
demonic as it stares at something that’s seemingl right
behind her She snaps a look back over her shoulder but
nothing’s there

The cat suddenly bolts right pasther -- the movement
startling Andrea who instinctively recoils She watches
the cat slip through a partially opened closet door into
the darkness beyond

As she gets to her feet Carolyn appears in the doorway

CAROLYN

Hey you’re supposed to be asleep
ANDREA

I saw that cat again it went into

the closet

Andrea heads to it A very curious Carolyn flips a light
switch on the wall as she enters --

CAROLYN
Really

She joins Andrea at the closet Opens the door wider

Carolyn reaches overhead and pulls on a light string
filling the large walk-in closet with bright light
There’s an array of clothes and shoes but -- no cat
Carolyn turns to Andrea --

CAROLYN (contd)
You sure

ANDREA
Yeah I swear

CAROLYN
It’s not here now It probably
just slipped out and we didn’t see

ANDREA
Well bills suck

Carolyn smiles --

CAROLYN

ANDREA

DISSOLVE TO

IN THE BED LATER

Carolyn who’s fallen asleep next to Andrea awakens to a
distant SCRATCHING NOISE he listens for few beats --
there it is again She climbs out of bed to investigate

INT HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

She comes out of the bedroom The SCRATCHING NOISE is
coming from downstairs She walks by several pictures of
Cindy Andrea and the family together hanging on the
walls as she heads toward the staircase

Suddenly the noise turns violent -- DEEP VICIOUS
SCRATCHES -- like nails across wood She slows her pace
dramatically

Carolyn moves to the top of the staircase -- almost too
afraid to look down Digs up some courage --

Her pov - THE CELLAR DOOR rattles upon impact as
something continues to dig and claw at the door from the
other side

INT HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn heads down as the scratching continues

INT HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

She comes off the bottom step and guardedly moves down
the hallway to the door

Just as she gets to it THE SCRATCHING INSTANTLY STOPS
The house gets church quiet She listens intently --
torn with what to do

Carolyn retreats momentarily back into the kitchen --
comes out a second later with a flashlight

She se 8 gets onto her hands and knees Targets a one
inch gee etween the bottom of the door and floor with
the flashlight then --

-- thumbs the switch THE LIGHT INSTANTLY REFLECTS OFF
TWO EYES BORING RIGHT BACK AT HER from within the dark

recess -- but there’s nothing human nor animal about
them
Carolyn freaks -- recoils in a frenzy of motion She

scrambles back to the kitchen door where she grabs a
RUBBER DOOR-WEDGE from the floor next to it She ushers
it back to the cellar door and SLAMS it into the gap

CINDY OC
(concerned)
What’s going on

Carolyn spins Sees Cindy and Andrea staring down at her
from the top of the stairs

Roger removes the chair and wedge Gun ready He slowly
opens the door --

-- Carolyn gasps at DEEP SCRATCHES that crisscross the
back of it

Roger stands still for a moment looking at them as well
then heads down a steep set of wooden stairs that get
lost in the darkness

He flips a nearby wall switch washing the cellar ina
dull yellow light
INT CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

Roger inches down the stairs Alert Ready He steps
off the bottom step -- pauses -- gun out -- eyes perusing
the shelves of canned goods and stacked moving boxes
There are no windows or other exits

He moves toward two wardrobe boxes -- big enough for
something to hide behind Closer Closer The knuckle
on his trigger finger whitens from pressure

He kicks one of the boxes over -- nothing happens Looks
behind the other -- empty

CUT TO

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER

Roger comes up off the stairs Closes the door behind
him Looks up to Carolyn and the girls who are waiting

playing tricks on you maybe
reflected off the railing or

RACHEL
It’s always in the middle of the
night around two-thirty

LORRAINE

DAVID
Creaking and moaning -- like
someone’s in pain
RACHEL
I think it’s David’s dad haunting
me -- trying to get me out of this
house
LORRAINE

Why would he do that

RACHEL

Because he hated me when we were
dating -- he told me I wasn’t good
enough for his son He died
before we got married and he’s
the one who left him this house

(beat)
He’s frickin buried fifty yards
across the street I don’t even
like living here -- it gives me
the heebs

Ed stops at the top

And this is where it’s strongest
Both nod
Ed looks up to see AN ATTIC DOOR DIRECTLY ABOVE THEM He
pulls on a rope opening it up -- unfurling a set of
attic steps

We don’t have to go up there with
you do we

flashlight Heads up into the dark abyss --

The place is full of old furniture wooden trunks boxes
clothing racks He continues up the creaky steps into
the attic Lorraine follows him up

LORRAINE
Funny how all attics smell the
same --

Lorraine moves over to a broken dormer window where
filtered moonlight pours in It casts a blue hue across
the room She looks out --

-- unfolding across a street is a large cemetery full of
tombstones -- hundreds and hundreds of them A thick
wet fog drifts through

Ed’s light falls on a cobwebbed covered bookshelf loaded
with dust He moves to it to get a look at several URN-
LIKE containers that have caught his attention Lorraine
joins him --

I know a lot of people would be
creeped out living by a cemetery
and -- throw a very old home into
the equation and you’re going to
get the creaking moaning sounds --
especially at night when
temperature and humidity changes
are the greatest and can cause
some shifting in the structure

DAVID
It’s not that We would know the
difference

Just then a MOANING NOISE that sounds LIKE SOMEONE’S IN
AGONY emanates through the room Rachel grabs onto
David’s arm --

RACHEL
Ohmygod that’s it --
‘ ED
Do it again Lorraine --
David and Rachel look to Lorraine -- huh They watch as
she steps on TWO water-stained WOODEN FLOORBOARDS that
run near an old heating radiator next to her -- producing

the same sound

ED (cont’ dq)
Right now it’s Lorraine’s weight
but add the moisture coming in
through this broken window at
night -- the boards are going to
expand and rub against each other
eat

Youve heard it in different parts
of the house because of the

When these things invade a home
it’s quite possible that something
has invited them here or conjured
them up somehow

LORRAINE
I’ve asked the girls but we need
to know -- have either you or your
husband ever practiced any kind of
Satanic worship -- anything of the
occult

Carolyn’s appalled at the notion

My God no

fun Play with a Ouija board
invoke things up in a Seance --
and then can’t get rid of them
it happens more often than you
now

from an auction through a Bank

I always wanted to live in the
country -- this was supposed to be
someplace safer than the city

Ed takes a moment then --

ED
This house obviously has to be
exorcised but to do that we need
the church to authorize a Priest
to perform one

CAROLYN
I’m fine with that

ED
It’s not that easy We have to
provide proof that what you’re
claiming is in fact happening but
that can be the hard part

Why’s that

Because it doesn’t always happen
when we need it to

She was a direct descendant of
Bridget Bishop --

We know that name --
She pauses --

they had a baby and when it was
seven days old Judson found it
sacrificed -- in front of the
fireplace

Ed can’t believe it --

LORRAINE (cont’d)
I’m assuming with knitting
needles Apparently -- she ran
out to the barn Climbed into the
rafters proclaimed her love to
Satan cursed anyone who tried to
take her land then hung herself

Lorraine slides an old neqsPaper clipping mounted on
parchment paper over to Ed o picks it up

LORRAINE (contd)
That’s her

-- Ed looks at the picture it’s of a woman hanging from
a rafter -- EXACTLY THE SAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS OF THE
WOMAN LORRAINE SAW HANGING IN THE BARN STARING DOWN AT
HER

ED
This is the woman you saw

She nods then --
LORRAINE

Ed -- she hung herself at five
fifteen in the morning

ED
That explains a few things

Lorraine then slides over an old black and white
photograph of an obese woman sitting in a wicker chair
lanked by a boy (wears glasses) and a girl who both

look about ten

LORRAINE
And that woman I saw in the
basement who shot herself -- I
think it’s this woman wholived
there in the thirties -- last name
is Walker She had two children
who mysteriously disappeared in
the woods -- it’s pro ably why she
killed herself I’m assuming
those are them --

Wow --

original five hundred acre farm
has been divided and sold off --

She unfurls an old map next to her Points to a spot

And a hunter who died in the woods
-- he lived here

Again she indicates --

There was a school bus accident on

He extracts a small hand-held meter from his pocket
Hands it to him

BRUCE (contd)

As Ed begins to hook it up --

ED
When there’s an energy present
the needle on it will begin to
fluctuate usually between 17 and

the Camera to start shooting

Roger looks over to him as he pulls the tire off Sets
it’ down

CUT TO

INT BARN - RIGHT AFTER

Roger walks in to find Ed working on the pickup The
front’s been jacked back up There are two pieces of
firewood lodged under the front axle for extra stability
He’s up to his elbows in grease as he packs the bearings

ED
I noticed you didn’t finish the
bearings ope you don’t mind --
just Iooking or something to do
ROGER
Not at all
ED

Got anymore more grease

ROGER
Yeah

Roger walks over to the work bench Opens a cabinet
above it and grabs a can from a shelf Pops it open as
he heads over to Ed and hands it to him

ED
Thanks

Roger grabs a nearby wooden crate Takes a seat on it
Watches Ed work

ROGER
Carolyn told me you going to be a
priest --
Ed ponders for a moment -- does he want to share this

ED
That was the plan -- but when I
got to my Ordination I started
having my doubts and realized I
wasn’t going to be good enough I
don’t have the strength they need
So I gave it up

Roger takes a beat

ROGER
I could scratch my head ‘til I’m
bald and never figure out why you
do what you do --

ED
Remember as a kid being afraid to
hang your hand off the edge of
your bed because you thought
Something underneath was going to
grab it

Roger nods somewhat skeptically

ED (contd)
Well mine got grabbed

As Ed throws more grease on the bearings --

ED (contd)
Something yanked me to the floor
It was too dark to see under the
bed but I ran my ass out of that
room as fast as I could My dad
didn’t believe me so he dragged
me back in there and told me I had
to face my fears I buried myself
under the covers scared to death
cause I could still hear it under
my bed Then I remembered what a
nun had told me in catechism “God
will be there for all who need
He is your protector” So I
grabbed my Davy Crockett knife
from my nightstand and got off the
bed and told whatever was under
there that God was going to kick
its ass if it didn’t leave I
just kept saying it over and over -
- and it finally went away Never
came back

Ed looks back to Roger --

ED (contd)
It was the best thing my dad ever
did for me I put my faith in God
every day after that and have
been checking under beds ever
since

Ed finishes packing the bearings Caps it

SCREAMS

Andrea bolts upright in fear then --

THE LOUD ECHOING SOUND OF A SLIDE-BOLT CLOSING OVER AND

OVER joins the mayhem -- it’s coming from the closet
Roger can’t stand it -- takes off out of the room --
The SLIDE BOLT NOISE suddenly stops -- along with the

Tight on a section of wood paneling being pried back off
the wall with a hammer

Widen -- to see Ed sliding the hammer up and down along a
panel’s seam to loosen it He finally pulls it back off
the wall --

Lorraine is the first to see --

-- A SMALL 2’ x 2’ TRAP DOOR framed within another wall
that latches from the outside via a SLIDE BOLT --

-- A WOMANS VERY OBESE HAND fingers like sausages
aggressively SLAMS it CLOSED then SLIDES A LATCH across
to lock it

Resume —

Lorraine and the others are looking at the trap door

Ed kneels down Undoes the latch Slowly opens the
door It’s too dark to see anything beyond

ED
Can someone get me a flashlight --

ROGER
Yeah there’s one in our room

Roger disappears for a moment Lorraine puts her hand on
Ed’s shoulder --

LORRAINE
Let me go in

Lorraine gets on her hands and knees as Roger comes back
with a small flashlight Hands it to her She thumbs
the switch Shines it into the open door --

-- the light stretches into what looks like a narrow
crawl space framed in wood

Lorraine slips half her body inside keeping the light
shining ahead

INT CRAWL SPACE -— CONTINUOUS

Lorraine can barely make it out but sees that the crawl
space seems to open up

LORRAINE
Looks like there’s some sort of
room
Her flashlight suddenly dies -- casting her into total
darkness She palms it a couple of times -- gets the

beam to shine again
As she points the light down the crawl-space ahead --

-- A YOUNG BOY AND GIRL full of angst and panicy
scramble toward Lorraine PASSING RIGHT THROUGH her body -
- it’s the two she saw in the photograph earlier

Resume —

Lorraine is slightly startled but continues into the
room ahead

INT HIDDEN ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Lorraine slowly stands her flashlight quartering the
darkness Cobwebs everywhere reflect off the light It
falls upon a makeshift bed with an old dust covered
blanket which has SLINKY TOY sitting on it Lorraine
picks it up -- sees a wooden box next to the bed with
other toys in it

She lets her light wander discovering that every wall is
completely covered with THE SAME PHRASE scrawled in
crayon over and over She moves closer Sees what it
says I’M SORRY MOMMY I’M SORRY MOMMY I’M SORRY
MOMMY I’M SORRY MOMMY

Lorraine stops -- senses something She slowly moves the
light off the wall and angles it to her forearm -- IT’S

COVERED IN GOOSEBUMPS And for a second her heart skips
a beat -- there’s something else she sees ——

-- the light cascading past her forearm down to the floor
illuminates BATHSHEBA’S DIRTY CRUSTED BARE FEET
straddling her own -- from behind Before Lorraine can
turn around --

-- she is aggressively shoved into the wall The
movement jars the flashlight and slinky from her grasp
and drops to the floor

INT LIVING ROOM - RIGHT AFTER

Lorraine is sitting before the monitors her eyes on the

one revealing the master bedroom where Roger is cuddling
Andrea on the bed who is sound asleep Carolyn is next

to him doing the same with Cindy who is also asleep

Chirping crickets and croaking frogs drift in through an
open window next to her

-- A loud THUD pulis her attention outside to where she
sees something flopping on the ground by the barn dust
rising -- as if there were some sort of struggle

Bruce walks into the room carrying a cup of steaming
coffee

LORRAINE
Keep your eyes on the monitors for

Lorraine heads out of the room

CUT TO

EXT PERRON HOUSE - RIGHT AFTER

Lorraine moves toward the Flopping movement which seems
to be slowing with each step she takes As she gets to
it the flopping stops Sees it’s an enormous barn owl --
neck broken eyes wide open Dead A compassionate look
sweeps over Lorraine’s face until she hears --

-- A DISTANT BLEND OF VOICES pained fearful full of
anxiety She follows them to the back of the barn where
through a thick wall of trees and shrubs she can barely
make out an old beaten pathway that threads through

She heads in

CUT TO

EXT GROWTH - RIGHT AFTER

The VOICES begin to grow in volume as Lorraine walks
deeper into the growth fighting her way through
overgrown branches following what’s left of the pathway

She comes out into a small clearing to see where the
voices are coming from

Before her surrounded by a crumbling stone wall and

com letely’ overgrown with weeds is an OLD CEMETERY with
maybe forty tombstones within Some broken some toppled
some incredibly worn The voices seem to be coming from
somewhere on the other side

She moves into it A wind begins to tumble pieces of
foliage across the ground then one tombstone catches her
attention -- the name reads Bathsheba Sherman She
moves up to it as the voices get louder and louder --
it’s almost deafening then --

-- THE VOICES INSTANTLY STOP and things fall into an
awful silence It becomes unnerving as Lorraine senses
something a presence -- very close

She scans the surrounding trees but everything beyond is
swallowed in the shadows of the night -- she keeps
staring knowing something is just beyond After a
moment --—

Lorraine turns around to Bathsheba Sherman’s grave Sees
something rotruding slightly from the ground before it --
it’s a child’s hand half covered with dirt and leaves
the skin is white nails chipped -- full of grime More
leaves blow away revealing more of a body barely buried

Lorraine inches closer -- it’s a young girl -- matted
hair clings to the porcelain white skin on the side of
her face The head is turned sideways As Lorraine
moves around to get a better view --

She looks to the little girl’s face -- blanches it’s her
daughter Judy

Then the exposed white skin begins to grey and
continues to darken and becomes ash-like -- the breeze
blowing every part of her away

Panic invades Lorraine’s body as a slow realization
overwhelms her She takes off running back the way she
came

SMASH CUT TO

EXT WOODS - PATHWAY - NIGHT

Trees branches claw at Lorraine’s clothes as she retraces
her steps on a wild scramble to get back She can see
the barn up head She blows out the overgrowth and
continues her sprint past the barn and to the house --

-- barely slows to whip open the front door

confused by her frenzy of motion

INT HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lorraine comes running into the kitchen She’s out of
breath Immediately goes to the phone on the wall

He’s about to say something when she raises her hand to
give her a second

He pulls her into an embrace -- gentle sympathetic

Whispers --

ED (contd)
You just can’t give this thing any
more strength than it already has

Lorraine takes a beat -- the realization setting in She
gives the slightest of nods knowing he’s right

holding two more photos in his hand

Angle on the photo - although grainy and transparent
it’s definitely the same boy with glasses Lorraine saw
but he’s at the top of the stairs heading down

JEROME
Now check this out

He drops a second picture Although it’s the same angle
the boy is now five steps further down the stairs He’s
got a terrified look on his face as he’s looking back up
over his shoulder at something at the top of the stairs

ROGER
What’s he looking at

JEROME
This --

Jerome drops the third photo from his hand onto the table
before them The image of the boy is gone but at the
top of the stairs is the dark presence of Bathsheba
Sherman -- although grainy and transparent as well her
image is a lot more defined and what stands out more
than anything are --

-- her pupil-less snow white eyes

LORRAINE
It’s her

Roger and Carolyn’s eyes are wide transfixed

ROGER
--Why would he be frightened of
her He’s dead

LORRAINE
From our perspective yes But
from that child’s she’s as real

a soft “clink”

Widen -- A SECOND CROSS set on top of the Grandfather
clock falls onto a rug below with a muffled thud

A THIRD CROSS on the coffee table joins suit The noise
stirs Bruce then --

ANDREA OC
(soft sleepy)
Cindy stop it

His eyes shift to over to her Although she’s semi-
asleep she thinks someone’s messing with the back of her
hair

Bruce watches in total shock as the back of Andrea’s hair
seems to rise up on its own

He slowly grabs his camera to document it
CUT TO

Camera’s pov - as a groggy Andrea reaches behind and
irritatingly swats at something that’s not there Her
long hair continues to rise --

ANDREA
I said to stop it

This time she opens her eyes and sees that no one’s
doing it but --

-- Her hair SNAPS TAUT and she’s aggressively yanked off
the chairand onto the floor She screams as she begins
to get wildly snaked all over the floor --

Although Bruce drops the camera to its side -- it keeps
rolling giving us a side view of Bruce moving over to
Andrea and grabbing onto her

Resume —

Whatever has hold of Andrea’s hair is strong enough to
keep moving them both as Bruce tries to protect her
enveloping the young girl with his large body tumbling
this way then that way when --

-- the two of them are slammed into the coffee table

where Bruce takes most of the impact -- pieces of wood go
flying

Ed and Lorraine come running in -- Ed joins the fight
struggling to hold BruceAndrea in one place -- it isn’t
working

The fight continues -- Andrea is wild-eyed screaming
hysterically -- her hair stretched to its Limit

Roger comes racing in then Carolyn who seems less
disturbed --

ROGER
Ohmygod

Bruce and Andrea hit the corner of the sofa which pushes

it four feet across the wood floor -- then they’re
immediately dragged once again --

Roger attempts to latch on to them -- the strain on
Andrea’s hair looks like it’s going to be pulled out of
her scalp until --

WHOOSH A PAIR OF SCISSORS slices right through it
releasing all tension

The struggle instantly stops Standing over Bruce and
Andrea is Lorraine Jerome’s scissors in hand

Roger immediately pulls Andrea into his arms

Ed looks to a very distraught Bruce whose face is bloody
from a wound on his forehead

Carolyn doesn’t turn around Lorraine slowly approaches

LORRAINE (cont’d)

As Lorraine nears it’s hard to tell if it’s the
afternoon light and shadows are playing tricks with her
eyes but it looks like from the side view there’s
something off about Carolyn’s face -- it almost looks
like another woman’s --

Carolyn slowly swivels her head to Lorraine -- which
seems normal now but there’s a distance in her eyes

pulling as hard as she can then -- it finally whips
open Lorraine races in --

She turns to her mom tears rolling down her cheeks Has
one of the chickens in her lap -- it’s not moving

everywhere -- all their necks broken at obscured angles

A shaft of moonlight piercing through a window stretches
across Lorraine’s face in bed Lorraine’s EYES SUDDENLY

The words chill her to the bone She gives Judy a slight
nudge --

LORRAINE

Judy doesn’t awaken continues --

JUDY

LORRAINE
Honey --

She shakes her harder Judy’s words fade as she rolls
over sound asleep

Lorraine slowly sits up digesting the current event
She gasps --

-- someone is standing in the far corner of the room

-- it looks like Bathsheba Sherman staring right at her
but --

-- it’s not a ghostly image -- IT LOOKS REAL

Keeping her eyes on the corner Lorraine reaches her hand
over to turn on the lamp Flips the switch --
illuminating the corner where --

-- there is no woman Only a narrow corner cabinet
Lorraine lets out a sigh --

LORRAINE (contd)
Get a grip Lorraine

CUT TO

INT MASTER BATHROOM - RIGHT AFTER

Lorraine now wearing pajamas finishes washing her face
then exits turning the light off

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

She walks over to the bed where Judy is sound asleep
Crawls under the covers As she reaches to turn off the
light -- her blood pressure races north -- the SLINKY she
threw away is right there

The four posts on her bed begin CREAKING -- she slowly
looks up --

-- stretched out upon the canopy is Bathsheba Sherman --
the contours of her eyes face and body clearly outlined
as she descends closer and closer -- the force of which
causing each of the bed posts to strain bending inward
like they’re made of rubber

Lorraine remains paralyzed unable to move chilled by
the ominous reality of this unholy spirit

Lorraine digs deep and finds some inner strength to get
herself moving -- scoops Judy up Dashes out through the
bedroom doorway just as the door whips closed right
behind her

and a Chevrolet station wagon Skid marks scar the
pavement Smoke and steam rise from both

Jerome holds the wheel tight fighting for control as his
van fishtails and SLIDES onto the dirt shoulder He
clips the front of the Pinto spinning the van into a

Looks to the engine Flames are growing Grabs for the

driver’s door handle but it’s all smashed in

his mother standing above the surface of the water --
expressionless

Ed looks like he’s been sucker punched

FATHER JORDON
The family aren’t parishioners
i

Baptized

LORRAINE

them As their eyes meet -- there’s an intensity to his
gaze

FATHER JORDON
Youve both have seen it done
dozens of times --

Ed looks at him like he’s out of his mind

ED
That doesn’t make us qualified

FATHER JORDON
But your strength and knowledge of
the scriptures can

ED

Weve seen it go horribly wrong
even with a Priest

FATHER JORDON
I believe our Lord recognizes
faith far more than he does
training and education or
politics for that mattér

but you do -- and you have God on

your side If you want to help
them then help them

wrist freeing the grasp she has on her and scrambles
back up the stairs

The girls recoil from the impact visibly trembling --

getting the hell out of there

Two steps into their departure --

-- THE CELLAR DOOR flies off hinges -- the chair goes
flying Standing in the doorway half in and out of the

hissing on each ex ale as she grips the knitting needles
tight in one hand

head who has her arms wrapped around Andrea in a death
grip holding her next to the bed -- the knitting needles

There’s scattered plaster on the floor from a fresh
bullet hole in the ceiling above

Cindy is a short distance away petrified

Roger looks like he could lose it any second --

LORRAINE

gun
We see Roger struggling with a decision -- stares at
Carolyn’s maniacal face before him

She seems to be enjoying every second of this tormenting
him by pulling Andrea in tighter --

LORRAINE (contd)
C’mon give it to Bruce

Carolyn immediately puts more pressure on Andrea -- who
is now beginning to turn slightly blue He raises it up
again

ED
Don’t give her what she wants
Roger yields

ROGER
You better be right

As he lowers the gun to give to Bruce --

WHAM He’s kicked by Carolyn with such brute force he
flies backwards across the room into the wall Glass
flies gun goes sliding across the floor Cindy’s losing
it fast Ed and Bruce move in to grab hold of Carolyn

Ed gets a backhand to the face Draws blood Bruce
leaps onto Carolyn bringing she and Andrea to the floor
but her grip remains strong on Andrea continuing to
squeeze the life out of her now more than ever

whelming -- Ed gets to his feet extracting the vial of
Holy water Dips his forefinger into it Crosses

Carolyn instantly arches her back folding her body into
an upside down “U” Ed gets close reaching out placing
his finger on Carolyn’s forehead making the sign of the
cross --

ED (contd)
Ecce crucem donine fugite partes
adversa

Behind it all we hear Lorraine saying the Lord’s prayer

The pictures fly off the dresser at sonic speed and
disintegrate into the opposing wall Glass shatters

ED (contd)
I beg you Lord through the
intercession and help of the arch
ngels Michael Rafael and
Gabriel for the deliverance of
our sister who is enslaved by the

evil one
Cindy stands still -- paralyzed with fear
ED (contd)
Imponat extreman parte stolae

Ed makes the sign of the cross over his chest then

flicks Holy Water on Carolyn A GUTTURAL SCREAM escapes
Carolyn’s mouth which looks like a spider web of saliva -
- and fora nano-second her skin becomes transparent
veiny pulsating

She begins to writhe and rotate on the wood floor taking
anyone holding on with her -- her body is unnaturally
stiff

A SOURCELESS WIND erupts within the room -- spinning
every ything around -- clothing and hair whip
uncontrollably

ED (contd)
Sanctissima vero Eucharistia super
caput obssessi aut aliter ejus
corpori ne admoveatur ob
irreverentia periculum

Lorraine sees Carolyn’s eyes keep fading back and forth --
from pitch black pupils to blue -- as if there were an
internal struggle going on --

LORRAINE
Fight it Carolyn Don’t let her
take you

The dresser slides across the floor ripping DEEP
SCRATCHES in the wood It just misses Lorraine by a
fraction as it plows right by her bounces off the bed
frame and embeds into the drywall

Lorraine looks to Cindy --

LORRAINE (contd)

Help us

ED
Keep her away --

LORRAINE
No Ed -- there’s a reason she
hasn’t killed her Carolyn’s still
fighting the possession -- she can

help her Get her to fight this

Ed pauses for a second his mind racing through limited
options Agrees with Lorraine Nods

LORRAINE (contd)
to Cindy)
Take her feet

Cindy quickly obeys holding down her mom’s feet as
Carolyn arches unnaturally 2 a contortion that would
seemingly break anyone’s back --
-- a thule then collapses back down to the floor with a
loud thu but keeps er death grip on Andrea who’s now
dimp in her arms her face turning blue from lack of
gen Ed and Bruce frantically try to pry her fingers
OF of Andrea but she’s too strong

The wind builds in intensity

Lorraine looks into Carolyn’s eyes that continue to fade
back and forth --

LORRAINE (contd)
You fight her Carolyn don’t give
up

CINDY
Please mom please You can do
it Make her let go of Andrea

ED
Nos eriperes de potestate diaboli
Ab omni hoste visibili et
invisibili et ubique in hoc

The bed flips up against the wall windows blast open
the lights surge with power

Carolyn gives one last burst of energy muscles twitch
and veins rise from under her skin but everyone holds
her down tight -- then like someone pulled the plug
Carolyn stops moving becomes limp almost catatonic

A

Her arms 1 off o ndrea who rolls to the floor in a
dead heap

Everything falls still -- not a sound It’s over

Roger immediately begins to give his daughter mouth to
mouth -- everyone watches on Crying praying hoping
A cough draws their attention -- it’s Carolyn who is
attempting toget her bearings when she finally does

she’s overwhelmed when she sees “her daughter not moving
then -

-- a small cough erupts from Andrea who then takes a
deep breath Tears flood from her father and sister

Carolyn crawls over to them stares at Andrea eye to eye
both emotional wrecks Pulls her into an embrace Roger
and Cindy join in

Lorraine takes a beat watching the Perron’s reunited
then looks to Ed Goes over to him Their eyes meet --

SCROLL
The Perron family left the house
that day and never returned
They relocated to Oregon where
they haven’t had anymore
encounters Shortly after their
move the house was purchased by
an anonymous buyer whom Ed and
Lorraine believe was the Catholic
Church The Warrens went on to
investigate over eight thousand
cases and to this day Ed is the
only non-ordained Demonologist
ever recognized by the Vatican
It was one year later that the
Warren’s were called to
Amityville
