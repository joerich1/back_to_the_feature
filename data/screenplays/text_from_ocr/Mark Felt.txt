MARK FELT - THE MAN WHO BROUGHT DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE

by

OVER BLACK

TITLE WASHINGTON DC 1972

Now a rhythmic accelerating anthology -- footage stills --

President Richard Nixon at re-election whistle-stops - As
Pennsylvania Ave roils with protest -- scrimmage lines of
National Guard and Police -- Washington Monument carpeted in
tents -- flames spitting out of Pentagon windows -- placards
of jungle trench full of American army dead -- LAPD squad
cars pouring smoke and flame --

Accelerating now to a torrent of campaign bunting and
bumperstickers and the signage and news feeds of Palestinian
Liberation Organization--Black Liberation Army--Klan--Black
September--Red Army--Irish Republican Army--Weather
Underground

The alphabet of rage Until we cut to black and HOLD there
on black

TITLE BASED ON THE ACTUAL EVENTS

Then--

AN ALARM CLOCK BEEPING 515 am A man’s hand enters frame
Shuts the alarm and now--

HANDS IN A MIRROR Perfecting a tie and now--

THE HANDS lay a dress on a bed across the feet of a woman
still asleep and now--

HOT WATER BEING POURED into a cup of Folger’s instant We’re
in an immaculate kitchen circa early-70’s and now to--

AN ANTISEPTIC LIVING ROOM Legions of obsessively aligned
glass animals Pictures of two KIDS young man around 20 in
Airman’s Uniform a young pretty woman Furniture shrink-
wrapped in plastic A pool out back vodka-clean Grass
manicured Now out to--

EXT STREETS - FAIRFAX VA - MORNING

A subdivision of modest split-level lookalikes The pierced
heart of the American middle

One garage door rises MARK FELT - immaculate suit 50ish -
strides to the curb trash in one hand coffee in the other
Moving with a kind of imperious grace

The PAPERBOY hook-shots the paper onto the lawn Jump to the
back yard He has a smoke He takes a moment with the
brightening sky And as we hold on him we--

EXT WASHINGTON DC - MORNING - FELT’S BUICK (MOVING) -
AERIAL

Crossing the Potomac Past the Lincoln Memorial While--

INT OFFICE - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Felt enters on Asst to the President JOHN EHRLICHMAN 45
staring out his window at the bedlam and Special Counsel
JOHN DEAN 33 and boyish And Attorney General JOHN MITCHELL

FELT EHRLICHMAN
Gentlemen Have a seat Felt
(as Felt sits--)

CLOSE IN in on Felt’s eyes Which have a rare and trained
hyper-awareness Capturing the smallest details like a
camera a patch of perspiration on Ehrlichman’s forehead a
smudge on Dean’s shoe

EHRLICHMAN (CONT’D)
Goddamn Russian Revolution out
there Why aren’t we arresting
anybody

FELT
Because that--
(out there)
Isn’t a crime
(which turns him)

MITCHELL
We know why you’re here Felt But
before all that The President
needs your advice

Dean moves to the side for a better angle

EHRLICHMAN MITCHELL (CONTD)
Hoover’s run the FBI what Fifty
forty years

EHRLICHMAN
Fifty goddamn years You know
Johnson and Kennedy wanted to fire
him don’t you But they didn’t
have the balls

(MORE )
EHRLICHMAN (CONTD)
(and he looks and waits
but--)

Felt is saying nothing And after an uncomfortable pause--

MITCHELL
Did you know the President wanted
to be an FBI G-Man just like you
Hoover wrote him personally what a
damn fine candidate he was but
with budget cuts the FBI couldn’t
afford him

EHRLICHMAN
How’s that for a lesson in fate
Now he’s President of the United
States

Pause

DEAN
If the President were going to ask
Mr Hoover to step aside how would
you suggest he do it

And Felt goes still as a dog will at a sign of danger

DEAN (CONTD)
We know you to be a friend to this
administration And we like to see
our friends get what they deserve--

MITCHELL
Youre next in line

FELT
There is no line

DEAN
The President is asking

Pause A hesitation Exasperation

FELT
Mr Hoover would want to keep his
bullet-proof car And his
secretary I’d offer him that

EHRLICHMAN
Youre a real politician Felt

FELT
I’m a law man
Polite smiles Maybe a chuckle

EHRLICHMAN

As the President likes to say

there are two kinds of people in

politics - winners and losers I

knew a loser once and he was a

queer
(intoning)

Gentlemen Mark Felt is no loser
(as Felt stays stoic
patient)

So okay Felt go ahead fire away

Felt’s errand--

FELT
As you know Mr Hoover has heard
rumors of the presence of
homosexuals at the highest levels
of the White House

MITCHELL
Who’s the fag supposed to be

EHRLICHMAN MITCHELL (CONTD)
Is he here in this room You want to polygraph us
(and they laugh)

Except Dean The lawyer Unamused

DEAN
Does the FBI really need to spend
resources on this
(laughter dies)
Do we

FELT
I can take it from here

DEAN
Then thanks for popping by
(and as the show is over
and they start to focus
on other things--)

FELT
If I may--
(they’re annoyed)
There is one thing Mr Hoover knows
has been on all your minds
(and just like that he has

their attention again)
(MORE )
FELT (CONTD)

Whenever the FBI hears a piece of
gossip or information such as I
saw so-and-so out with another
woman not his wife Or a man not
his wife-

(and start a slow push in)
We’re supposed to write everything
down And we do Write it all down
In memos

(gives that some air)

These memos come to me and I decide
what information Mr Hoover needs
to know and send that up to Mr
Hoover And Mr Hoover puts it all
away In his private files

To be kept safe Out of the hands
of people without discretion
People who could do harm Should
that information be leaked for
instance And put before the court
of public opinion

n

TIGHT on Felt’s face until it fills the screen To these men
this face is now the still center of the universe

FELT (CONTD)

And then sometimes Mr Hoover will
go for instance to the
Presidents closest aides and say -
Mr Ehrlichman I want you to know
that we received that report about
you and that other woman and I
want to tell you that there is
absolutely no reason for us to take
any further action There is no
violation You are safe We the
FBI all your secrets are safe with
us

Tense silence The threat lands Then--

DEAN
How long have you been in the FBI
Felt

FELT

Thirty years

DEAN
Thirty years That’s a lot of
information A lot of files
(yes it is and)
Thank you Mr Felt

FELT
Thank you gentlemen

And winks at Miller Audrey clutches him Her hero

AUDREY
Now I need a drink
(and she heads into)

KITCHEN - where we find Audrey alone in the harsh All
fluorescence In that dress Back to living room waiting
Until Felt appears and embraces her from behind What she
wanted Then cut to--

LIVING ROOM - LATER 11

The room gone smoggy with cigarette smoke furniture cleared
Earnest tango instrumental blaring from the phonograph

The Felts and the Millers tango from one end of the room to
the other Felt graceful and commanding Audrey sexy and
liquid Fabulous dancers

Now they switch Natural and loose in new arms then--

SAME - STILL LATER They’re all sauced Messy rapture Ed andl2
Pat smoking on the sofa Audrey hanging on Felt at the piano

FELT

my heart

FELT (CONTD) AUDREY

me Not if you care for me

And he does And Audrey rests her head on his shoulder
Nothing in the world but you Now--

SAME - STILL LATER 13

Now it’s Pat slinked against Felt at the piano While Audrey
and Ed do a slow dance Like ass-clutchy high-schoolers

AUDREY (CONT’D) FELT
Kiss her Mark Stay little valentine stay
AUDREY FELT (CONTD)
She wants you to She told me (shakes No)

Audrey blows a kiss at Felt Pat rests her head on his
shoulder As Ed gives Audrey a twirl and--

PAT MILLER

INT HALLWAY - FELT HOME - LATER 14

Felt and Audrey clop up the stairs drunk At the top Audrey
topples toward a partially open door Felt pulls the door
shut tight--

AUDREY
Wanna go’n there

--and steers her away back down the hall

INT BATHROOM - FELT HOME - LATER 15

Audrey on the edge of the sink Felt on his knees with great
precision painting her toe-nails then--

INT BEDROOM - FELT HOME - LATER 16

Felt guides Audrey to bed She pulls him on top of her
clinging to him as though afraid she’ll plunge She tries to
shut off the light He stops her “I want to see you” She
opens to him brings him inside They make love passionate
and forceful and present

Then HEAR (PRE-LAP) ICE CUBES in a glass Liquid poured over
them And cut to--

EFREM ZIMBALIST JR frozen in a gunslinger’s crouch 17

PULL BACK to REVEAL it’s a poster on a wall the kitsch-
perfect G-Man in the “The FBI”

PAN RIGHT to a framed photo 25-ish Mark Felt as same hat
cocked stagy G-Man gun crouch Now--

PAN to our Felt Twice that age In a robe fixing a solitary

drink Alone and in deep contemplation We’re in his office
and we HOLD ON HIM there then--

INT FBI HQ - MORNING 18

Felt strides purposefully down a grand deco hallway Past WPA
murals and endless offices First in

TITLE MAY 2 1972
And into his suite 7 am on the nose 19

FELT
Good morning
CAROL TSCHUDY 35 takes Felt’s coat and hat

FELT (CONT’D)
Is the Director in

CAROL
Not yet

Mrs Felt called

FELT
How many times

CAROL
Just once

FELT
Thank you Mrs Tschudy--
(and--)

Felt continues to his inner office Unholsters his 38
sticks it in a drawer And pan up to find--

ED MILLER By the window He’s an Agent Felt’s second-in-
command Hasn’t slept and looks it

Miller hands Felt a folder stamped “PLAN C - TOP SECRET”

It’s funny In this building the warmth has gone The
familiarity and intimacy has gone It’s all business And we
PAN DOWN now to the crime-scene shots in Felt’s hands

The Capitol building facade blackened windows blown then
the wreckage inside “Weather Underground Organization
bombing Capitol building”

FELT (CONT’D)
How many bombings now

MILLER
A couple dozen

FELT
Precise numbers Mr Miller

The formality surprises us Not them
Another photo Four charred corpses
MILLER
Nails and ball bearings They blew

themselves up But these kids
aren’t messing around

Felt holds up surveillance photos of SUSPECTS Everyday
American Youth Then a Weather Underground pamphlet--

FELT
They’re embarrassing the FBI
(and then they both
realize it same time)
They’re going to try to hit the
White House

MILLER
Yes they are

NOW AN FBI MAN enters CHARLIE BATES 40

BATES
He’s dead

FELT
Who

BATES

The housekeeper found Mr Hoover on
the floor He wasn’t breathing

Felt looks sharply at Miller

BATES (CONTD)
It looks like a stroke

Felt rises to his feet 0S we hear Carol gasp

FELT
Put everything into motion No
mistakes gentlemen Not one
(Bates crosses and leaves
then Miller)

And Felt and Carol are left alone Holding a long look
Carol’s face says “You’re the new director”

20 INT FBI HQ - DAY

BATES and MILLER keep the halls clear while--

FELT supervises SECRETARIES shuttling file boxes from
Hoover’s office across the hall into Felt’s

PUSH IN on the boxes “Official and Confidential” ONE BOX IN

PARTICULAR CLOSE “Personal and Confidential” as--

NIXONRADIO (OVER)
All Americans today mourn the death
of J Edgar Hoover His greatness
will remain inseparable from the
greatness of the organization he
created and gave his whole life to
building the Federal Bureau of
Investigation

(and cut to--)

A MAN BUSTING INTO THE HQ ENTRANCE small balding
accountant-like This is L PATRICK GRAY 56 Trailed by
three YOUNG JUSTICE DEPT LAWYERS As Nixon continues

enforcement agency on the earth
the invincible and incorruptible
defender of every Americans
precious right to be free from
fear

(and cut to--)

A SERIES OF SHOTS ELSEWHERE IN FBI HQ files films and

recordings being pulled shredded shoved in burn bags And

cut back to--

GRAY AND MINIONS heading down an endless hallway through prim23

SECRETARIES and sober AGENTS Past the stacks and stacks
files and papers on the move the hushed Kafkaesque
bureaucratic constipation Then back to--

FELT Watching the last box go

CAROL
They’re here

FELT
(marking the time)
Nine-oh-five
(and as Carol jots that
down we cut back to--)

GRAY Dead-ending doubling back disoriented No one
offering directions Fuming Finally finding--

FELT BATES AND MILLER waiting for him outside Hoover’s
locked office Gray shakes Felt’s hand

GRAY
Good morning Felt

FELT
The Assistant Attorney General--

of

GRAY
Pat Gray A complicated morning for
all of us

FELT
Mr Miller is making the funeral
arrangements

GRAY

I have the Attorney General’s
instructions on seating and

protocol--

MILLER
The funeral will be handled by the
FBI

GRAY

--the Attorney General will sit
beside the Vice President-

FELT
Handled by the FBI in its own way
Mr Gray

Stop FBI AGENTS start to collect around them

GRAY
(less confident now)
I also have instructions on Mr
Hoover’s files I am to take
possession of them And bring them
to the White House

FELT
What files

Gray turns to one of his flacks Who shrugs

GRAY
Mr Hoover’s secret files The
‘Personal and Confidentials’
(Flack whispers something
to him)
‘Official and Confidentials’

MILLER
There are no secret files

Gray turns to Felt Felt levels at him a look we will come to
know a poker-faced imperiousness that means ‘I don’t know’
and ‘I’m not going to tell you’ both and neither

INT HOOVER’S OFFICE - FBI - DAY 26

infamous three-inch platform Behind Dillinger’s death mask

don’t like anybody

They stop Face each other

FELT

SULLIVAN
You didn’t even let me keep my

FELT

At least it wasn’t the gold watch

SULLIVAN
No you just change the locks on

Leaving Felt standing alone

INTEXT FELT HOME - FAIRFAX VA - THAT EVENING

The antiseptic kitchen a happy wreck Half-eaten dinner sink
full OS laughter party murmur Audrey enters from the
pool Bonfire of warmth and joy looks her best We follow
her back out to find Felt and the Millers around a table out
by the pool Many drinks and cigarettes in

AUDREY

(joyous )
Do you-all remember when Mr Hoover
sent Mark to the Oval Office to
roust out the homos--

(her best - and fairly

good - John Dean)
You’re a politician aren’t you
Felt

(her best - and very good -

Felt)
No Mr Mitchell I’m a law man

PAT MILLER
Cmon

AUDREY
(her best - and extremely
good - Ehrlichman)
Two kinds of people in politics
Felt winners and losers I knew a
loser once and he was a queer Mark
Felt’s no queer

Audrey’s a social genius They’re laughing hard As Felt
quietly blows smoke rings at the ceiling

AUDREY (CONTD)
Hey handsome Where’d you go

Felt and Miller glance at each other

PAT MILLER
(to Audrey)
Let them protect their government
secrets Here it’s me and you lady

How is Mark Jr

FELT MILLER
He’s loving the Air Force God That’s wonderful--

Made his first solo flight--

PAT MILLER MILLER (CONTD)

Hear anything from Joan Pat don’t-

PAT MILLER
Eddie hush It’s fine This is
mothers’ business

But Audrey’s face stuck in something like a smile so--

FELT
Nothing It’s been a year

AUDREY
Don’t do this now

FELT
When is a good time

AUDREY
Just not in front of the whole
world darling--

And she’s up arms around him Smiling like nothing’s wrong

AUDREY (CONTD)
I don’t want anything to ruin

tonight
(wriggles her finger)
C’mere
And takes Felt by the hand - “Ta-da”- pulls him up and into--

INT BASEMENT OFFICE - FELT HOME

Where Felt’s desk has been raised on a three-inch platform

New name plate wrapped in ribbon “DIRECTOR”

AUDREY

Just like Mr Hoover’s There we

are my darling hero Here’s to

you
(emotional)

Everything we always wanted
(and embraces him lips to
his ear)

I know you wanted her here for

this But I’m here

(and with a squeeze--)
I’m always here--

And leaves the men to their business Felt obviously worried

MILLER
What is it

FELT
When the lion is dead the jackals
come out

MILLER
You’re worried about Sullivan

FELT
Sullivan is outside our fence

MILLER
He’s with the White House now He’s
one of them

FELT
The White House is outside our
fence

And close on Felt because it’s something else and cut to--

INT OFFICE STAIRWAY - FELT’S HOME

Where Audrey is loitering near the door Listening

INT FELT’S OFFICE - FBI HO - DAY

Felt at his desk we think staring into the middle distance
We REVERSE TO HIS POV

Hanging behind his door in perfect sight-line from the desk
(and desk only) a photo of a striking almost ethereal YOUNG
WOMAN in her early 20’s Looks a lot like Felt This is his
daughter JOAN (Younger picture of her in the living room)

CAROL INTERCOM
The Attorney General

Felt takes a breath of anticipation picks up We hear only
his end of things

me and my family for thirty years

Eyes make a subtle shift no more than the dilation of
pupils His hand clenches Unclenches Fists The
disappointment is palpable HOLD and--

FELT (CONTD)

(cold now neutral)
I agree A new day--
Yes a fresh start It’s what I’d
do

(can barely get it out)
Who do you have in mind

(then)
I’m sorry can you repeat that
Who

(and now SMASH CUT TO)

FELT BATES and MILLER MARCHING shoulder-to-shoulder through
the halls of HQ Closing in fast on a huddle OF FIVE MEN
outside Hoover’s old office

FELT (CONTD)
(hand extended)
Welcome to the FBI

The NEW DIRECTOR turns It’s PAT GRAY

GRAY
(relieved)
A friendly face--
(pumps Felt’s hand)

FELT
Excuse us gentlemen
(and when he and Gray are
alone--)

GRAY
I know the Bureau has its closets
and skeletons You can count on me
to keep those doors shut

Felt stops them by a window Out the window is Pennsylvania
Avenue And down Pennsylvania the White House

GRAY (CONT’D)

I’1ll be candid with you--

(trying to connect and

Felt gives nothing)

I was a submarine commander in the
Navy I was father priest and
friend to eighteen-year-old boys
Did you know that

() (MORE)

GRAY (CONT’D)
But not a suspicious man by nature
funny enough Which maybe makes me
a strange choice to run the FBI
(still doesn’t respond)

In fact when the President called
my wife begged me to turn it down
(and laughs waiting for a

friendly sign - it

doesn’t come)
The President wasn’t asking If you
know what I mean

(an awkward silence then)

FELT
Now let me be candid with you Mr
Gray The FBI is the most respected
institution in the world It is one
of the two cockpits that fly
America And it is what it is
because no one from the outside
ever got inside Mr Hoover’s been
old a long time

GRAY
We all know it’s been you running
the FBI Felt Your reputation is
stellar

FELT
Let me finish
You have no law enforcement
experience You’re an outsider
That’s your battle to fight--
(now)
But I’m going to help you

GRAY
I appreciate that--

FELT
Don’t It’s not an act of
generosity This is about this
building and what goes on in here
and what it means to the country
That’s all I care about As long as
you’re for what I’m for as long as
you keep the FBI first you’ll be
able to count on me

(long beat then)

Ready

MILLER
Did you mean it

Gray uncertain drifts away Miller and Bates cross to Felt

FELT
(turning with fealty
toward Gray--)
The Acting Director is ready now

34 INT KITCHEN - FELT’S HOME - THAT NIGHT

Felt enters Audrey takes his dinner plate out of the oven
He stands looking at the food She picks at his tie knot

FELT
What did I miss

AUDREY
You and Mr Hoover You forget why
he liked you so much He always
said you and he had the same
enemies-—-
Those men are ugly Ugly ugly men
Assassins All the assassins

Youre good Mark Felt is too good

(--)
Too good that’s why
(but acid as)

She turns him slow sensual and we think maybe with love and
giving Then--

AUDREY (CONTD)

Thirty years Thirteen transfers
thirteen homes to leave eleven
homes to make I left behind every
friend I ever made Two children
Cocktails at night And kept my
mouth shut Like the perfect little
FBI wife Until one day you wake up
and you’re so different than you
used to be you can’t remember what
the point was in the first place
And you’re still never here As
gone as she is And then what’s
left--

Now he turns to look at her

AUDREY (CONTD)
Until there’s just one thing left
In my head The one idea left in my
head is at least Mark’s going to
get that job At least he’ll be
Director of the FBI

(MORE )

AUDREY (CONTD)

And that’ll make up for everything

(then)
They don’t deserve you
They don’t deserve everything I
gave them I gave them you I gave
away our daughter

(and ramping up here--)
And they don’t know do they

FELT
Audrey--
(not again please--)

AUDREY
They think Mark Felt is so strong
All the girls think you’re so cool
They don’t know you

FELT
What don’t they know

AUDREY
That I’m the fuel--
They don’t deserve us
(--)
You need to resign
(he doesn’t resist but--)

FELT
When the Bureau’s in better hands
Then I’1l1 go
(and after a long beat)

AUDREY
What did you miss You missed
everything How could you be so
goddamn naive
(and walks out of the
kitchen leaving him
alone)

We’re still gathering string It’s
just the beginning--

GRAY
Okay first of all no more

people without permission

BATES FELT

Gray looks up stunned by their reaction

FELT (CONT’D)
Give us a minute gentlemen

Bates - fuming - leaves Gray’s lawyers don’t

FELT (CONT’D)
Get out
(Gray too weak to protest
and when they do)
The FBI is a independent body

GRAY
I’m aware of that

FELT
Are you also aware that means we
don’t need permission to do
anything From anybody
(Gray looks at him)
You give that up just one time
you don’t get it back Ever

GRAY
Let’s not get dramatic We don’t
even know what this is

FELT
That’s right we don’t But we’re
going to find out That’s what we
do

Pause Gray just sits there In his golf clothes

FELT (CONTD)
You don’t work for them You’re the
Director of the FBI now
(waits for that to land
then turns to go)

GRAY

Forty-eight hours--

(Felt stops)
We put the investigation to bed and

Just coffee

So what does this look like to you

FELT (CONTD) SMITH
Or your editors-- This Watergate thing

SMITH (CONTD)

Honestly No one at Time Magazine

figure it out Ex-spooks get
caught but doing what Planting
bugs The place was already bugged
The White House may be a bunch of
certifiable paranoids but that
stupid That would be a stupid
world record

(another forkful)
How ‘bout you

Felt doesn’t reply That interests Smith

SMITH (CONTD)

Does have a particular odor to it
though

(fishing--)
I bet your old pal Bill Sullivan
sure misses the FBI

(Felt doesn’t take the

bait Smith casts

further)
(MORE)

I hear the White House gave him
some bullshit job until Hoover
kicked the bucket Gray for a
little while keep the seat warm--

How the Post knows we know Then
this morning our Time Magazine pal
Sandy Smith called the Director and
said he’s prepping a story that the
FBI is plotting a whitewash He
said the Director put a 48-hour cap
on the investigation

KUNKEL
Is that true

FELT
(furious)
Someone in this office is talking
to the press The point Mr Lano
is leaks kill investigations

LANO KUNKEL
Whoa first of all-- (eyeing the other Agents
pretending to not listen
in)

Keep it down Angie

LANO
If you want to conduct a leak
investigation be my guest but two
hundred field agents from here to

have to ask all them too

But I will guarantee it wasnt me
or any of the guys in this room

Stop Quiet Felt levels a look at Lano Cold paralyzing

He called Hunt a few dozen times

lawyer in the Treasury Department
What about these payments

tracking

Indictable under election laws

lines While he’s drawing--

breath Mark’s face sets with an expression we now know
well caged emotion

As Mark puts a pistol to the horse’s temple Then--

YOUNG MARK ON KNEES 77

scrubbing blood off the barn floor and walls Weeping
silently with rage and--

CUT TO BLACK

BLACK SCREEN AND STOP

Nothing No sound Then

CRACK THE GUNSHOT

SMASH CUT TO

FELT’S EYES RIPPING OPEN 78

He’s lying in bed in the bedroom in the dark Woken from the
memory He looks to Audrey She’s not there

The phone is RINGING (The phone we’ve been hearing)
FELT
(picks up)
What is it
(and smash to--)

THAT PENTAGON MAJESTY Then 79

KA-BOOM

A giant fireball RIPS through the Pentagon’s second floor
Burning glass and debris billow into the sky Now back to--

INT DEN - FELT HOME - NIGHT 80

Felt on the phone in his robe At the window looking out
into the back yard

GRAY PHONE
(freaked)

FELT
It’s at the top of the
Underground’s hit list I told you
that three months ago

GRAY PHONE
(panicked)
But can they really hit it

FELT
They just hit the Pentagon

What Felt is seeing outside poolside the cherry of a single
cigarette surges in the night The shape of Audrey on a
chaise On the wall behind him a portrait of Joan

GRAY PHONE
I want us to open files on every
member of every counter-culture
organization in the country

FELT
(watching his wife)
They’re mostly kids We’re looking
for killers not moody teenagers

GRAY PHONE
The President is fighting for the
White House--

FELT
That’s not my job We need better
intelligence not paperwork--

GRAY PHONE
(losing it)
The President needs order I
promised the President he’d have

order
FELT

Ill go to the Attorney General
GRAY PHONE

I already spoke to the Attorney

General
And there it is Beat of tense silence

GRAYPHONE (CONT’D)
I hear you and your wife are

I hope you’re not going to let

bounding down the stairs STOPPING--

FELT (CONTD)
Oh no -- Oh no -- OH NO

We see what he sees

AUDREY IN A POOL OF HER OWN BLOOD Felt’s service revolver
beside her She’s blown her brains out

He’s on his knees Cradling her body her head - the mess -
in his hands First the horse Now her And now--

SCRUBBING the basement floor Scrubbing the mess away As he 82
scrubbed the horse’s blood Sobbing Furiously Erasing the
mess NOW--

INT BASEMENT OFFICE - FELT’S HOME - LATER 84

Audrey slow-steps half-way down the steps to the basement
She stops Then we HEAR why

THIS IS THE SOUND OF FELT SOBBING

It could be that Audrey’s never heard him cry before Come
around on Felt awash in tears About this and every other
thing

Audrey heads back up Without going to him Hoping he doesn’t
notice

He hears turns to look for her just as she withdraws into
the upper reaches of the house Behind him now no body Just
Felt on his knees in the middle of the floor Alone And we
go from that human loss to the mechanical clatter of--

EXT WASHINGTON PARK - MORNING A85

PAN ACROSS A DOZEN YOUNG PROTESTERS waking from a night of
sit-in protest amid their trash and radical signage

CAMERA FINDS FELT in his black suit stepping carefully among
the kids Contemplating their faces

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN stirs A BABY BOY in her arms

YOUNG WOMAN

You and your boy there

wallet)

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t want your money

FELT
Your parents would want someone to
do this They’d want someone to
take care of you

And he’s pulling out a few tens She won’t take them He puts
them in the baby’s little hands They fall like leaves and he
picks them up and tries again then just leaves the girl and
the money and--

Paper drifts across the floor Felt watching with the YOUNG

YOUNG AGENT

Felt now grabs a handful of photos from a two-foot high
stack Mug shots Surveillance photos Year book photos All

YOUNG AGENT
Shoplifted Cut school Wrote an
angry letter to the White House

FELT
Protestors

YOUNG AGENT

the print out and starts
to read)

FELT
Where’s this data coming from

YOUNG AGENT

MILLER
The Palestinian unit that
slaughtered the Israelis is going

GRAY
This connected to the Pentagon

MILLER

GRAY
I’1l leave you all to it then
(and he leaves and--)

MILLER
We’ll never get warrants Not now

FELT

Warrants We’re not talking the
kids sleeping out there in the
parks

(pointing out there)
Were talking about people who
would burn your children alive in
their beds If people die because
we stick to the letter of the law
we lose everything Including the
law

(and so now--)
Were taking off the gloves
Entries taps Nothing on paper No
warrants

(Miller and Bates put down

their pens)
Mr Miller’s people report to Mr
Miller Mr Miller reports to me--

MILLER
Just like the bad ole’ days
Where’s Bill Sullivan when you
really need him

FELT

(explodes )
He’s over at the White House
protecting the nation by spying on
Senators and their mistresses
Here let me give you his goddamn
number and you can go work with
him Instead of here where we’re
just trying to keep all this
goddamn mess together

STOP Long tense silence Felt never raises his voice Now--

All leave

MILLER

(voice of reason)
Hey look we’re on your side All
I’m saying is that was all behind
us Even Hoover knew the dirty
stuff was over That’s why Bill’s
gone

(--)
All I’m saying is everyone’s
watching

(and Felt turns on him

now)

FELT

How many more kids do we have to
lose How many more do we just let
vanish into eternity

(and they all know what

he’s really talking

about what he really

means then steel)
I am not Bill Sullivan This is
still the goddamn FBI

Except Felt And Miller When they are alone--

MILLER
I don’t want to intrude--

FELT
Then don’t

MILLER
Hear anything From Joan

FELT
(softer than we expect)
Nothing in six months She could be
anywhere

MILLER
You think she’s involved In all
this The Underground

Felt looks at him Hit Internally buckling--

FELT
How could she She’s just like me
Exactly like me
(and Miller nodding yes
that’s it)

MILLER
She worships you You are her moon
and stars
(--)
She’s okay I can feel it Mark

And that stops him “Mark”

FELT

There’s a price to pay for what we
do Mr Miller There’s a price to
pay for what we become We all pay
it one way or another

INT FELT’S OFFICE - FBI HQ - DAY 89

Felt shuts the door sits Takes a breath We PAN AROUND and
see he’s contemplating that photo of Joan

CAROLINTERCOM (OVER)
Mrs Felt on the phone

FELT
Take a message
(and--)

Takes a stack of 50 blank envelopes out of his briefcase
Taps them to align edges Pulls out his wallet and out of
that a folded piece of paper

PUSH IN CLOSE and we SEE a list of addresses written in
Felt’s impeccable calligraphy-like script

With painstaking precision Felt starts addressing envelopes
Each to a different address but every one in California

INT FELT’S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT 90

Indian summer The air thick Felt enters in his suit hat

FELT
Audrey

Nothing Goes deeper into the house We pick up the SOUND of
ice tumbling in a glass Felt is stopped in the den by the
sight of her outside in the dark pool lights off Knows
what that means Braces himself and And he heads out to--

EXT BACK YARD - FELT’S HOME

Audrey’s smoking and drinking on a chaise poolside
contemplating the night Felt approaches She hands the
cigarette up Felt takes a drag hands it back He sips at
her drink Bottle of gin by her foot

AUDREY

Maybe she’s dead Maybe she just
gave up didn’t think anyone cared
Or christ--

(and waves at the woods)
Maybe she never left Maybe she’s
right out there watching us To
see what a man like you does when
your daughter just vanishes one
night for no good reason

FELT
Joan had a reason for everything

AUDREY
Oh here we go again it was my
fault

FELT

You hated her

AUDREY
Mothers don’t hate their daughters
It’s just not always easy being
one

FELT
She was beautiful and smart You
dressed her up like a doll Until
she got old enough to look just
like you You were jealous And you
hated her for it--

AUDREY FELT (CONTD)
Mark Don’t-- You kept telling her to get
out Until one day she
listened to you

AUDREY FELT (CONTD)
I’m begging you listen to me But she did--
I had no mother-

AUDREY
No Listen to me
(and she takes his hands)
My mother was 47 when she had me
And my father just left
(MORE )

AUDREY (CONTD)

There weren’t many ways for a woman
to support herself to survive--

(and Felt slows this is

new hearing this for the

first time--)
--So yes she did she gave me up
To foster homes She didn’t want to
lose her daughter completely But
then the orphanage And then she
just stopped coming back--

(and stops herself this

biblical realization)

Felt lowering to a chair lights a cigarette Listening
Always collecting clues to his wife As she goes on--

AUDREY (CONTD)
And when I was eleven I was placed
in that home and I loved it They
told me to call them mom and dad
But they told me to my face that
they’d keep me only until I went
into puberty As soon as I had my
first period I was out because
they didn’t want to deal with all
that All that womanhood and boys
So when I got my first period I
didn’t want to leave I hid the
rags And I had to use rags to
wash myself after everyone went to
bed so they wouldn’t know And then
they did find out And then I was
just gone
And then I made it on my own

(--)

Until you My white knight You’re
everything to me The homes we made
were the only homes I ever had
When you walk into a room you’re
the only thing I see

FELT
You are both mine

And now tries to embrace her Mine The phone starts ringing
inside the house And just as quickly the moment is lost--

FELT (CONTD) AUDREY
Don’t (leave) -- I need to get that

And he watches her cross to the kitchen and then to the
phone Watching her through the window pick up the phone
Chipper Like nothing has happened

AUDREY (CONTD)
(into phone)
Hello Oh hi Margaret No
I never made it I was swamped with
house work
(and now--)

Felt turns to the pool Stands there a beat Strips off his
shirt His pants

Then slips into the water Until he’s gone beneath a rash of
bubbles And we stay with--

FELT’S POV Looking from the bottom up at a rectangle of sky
Audrey in view wavy through the interference of water

Felt about to burst But can’t rise Hungry for the quiet and
dark isolation Desperate for the safety of the coming death

Until a beat before drowning we rise with him And he
EXPLODES to the surface GASPING FOR BREATH

And lifts himself out of the pool Dripping and shivering

Listening to Audrey gossip we BEGIN TO HEAR in PRE-LAP

‘No pressure has been put on me or

“The FBI’s Watergate investigation

PUSH IN ON FELT while hearing the rest of this He reddens
Jaw clenches Hands clench into fists

KUNKEL (OVER) (CONTD)
--What is involved here is not
only the political life of this
nation but the very morality of
our leaders at a time when the
United States desperately needs to
revitalize its moral standards--”
(it’s killing Felt like
nothing else could kill
Felt)
That’s it

Despondent silence Nothing left to say Then--

FELT
Well gentlemen here’s what we
know We know what we’ve heard out
of the Department of Justice the
last two days is bullshit

(he has their attention)

We know the men who broke into the
Watergate are not the end of this
thing but the beginning

(MORE)

FELT (CONTD)
We know this is the latest link in
a chain of illegal covert
intelligence operations by the
President’s re-election campaign
We know we are facing obstruction
from multiple fronts From the
White House From the Central
Intelligence Agency From the
Attorney General of the United
States Who is our boss

(--)

It is not our job to speculate on
the involvement of the President
It is our job to follow the bread
crumbs But those bread crumbs

appear to be taking us on a tour of

the West Wing of the White House

and in the general direction of the

Oval Office We also know we’ve
been ordered to shut down our
pursuit of all this as of today
And we know that except for the
thirty men in this room no one in
the entire country knows any of
this and may never know any of
this--

Unless we tell them

(and now)

No one can stop the driving force
of an FBI investigation Not even

Its almost half of them now

Felt He’s thinking about his life and its consequences

This is very much like that moment in the life of a man who
has not yet cheated on his wife but who is staring at a
motel room door on the other side of which lies a woman with
whom there will be no debate Once he goes through that door
life as he knows it will never be the same

Felt gets out of the car Steps into the booth Dimes Dials

I’m talking about political
sabotage crimes conceived in the

(now a long quiet then--)
There is only one way to understand
what Watergate really means and
this is it

The name is Alex Shipley Shipley
He lives in Nashville The man who
approached him was a lawyer out of
LA named Donald Segretti
Segretti S-E-G-R-E-T-T-I

WOODWARD
(flustered)
Mr Felt--
FELT

A pleasure to meet you
Woodward looks to Felt Felt is imperious and blank

Felt nods

WOODWARD
(confused a little
panicked)

I didn’t have much time to prepare

BATES
The FBI likes to extend courtesy to
the press whenever it can and Mr
Felt had a sudden opening So the
usual rules Mr Felt will only
confirm or deny Nothing on the
record or on background

WOODWARD
(making it up)
Okay so regarding the break-in at
the Watergate We have Hunt
standing outside the hotel that
night

FELT
I’1l1 confirm

WOODWARD
And we have two ex-CIA and two ex-
FBI agents involved

Woodward dutifully makes a note

WOODWARD (CONT’D)
And this check deposited in the
account of one of the burglars
(Woodward and Felt hold a
look)
It was a CIA account correct

FELT
That is true But I won’t confirm

WOODWARD
You just said it was true

FELT
That doesn’t mean we want people to
know that it’s true So I won’t
confirm it

WOODWARD
I need more detail

FELT
Get it somewhere else

Pause Woodward looks again to Felt for a sign Nothing

BATES
(surprised)
That’s it That’s what you want
You know how many people get to sit
in that seat

Woodward takes a breath throws what he guesses is the pass
he was brought here to throw

WOODWARD

Just one more thing I guess
Someone identifying himself as a
‘government lawyer’ called my
colleague at the Post Carl
Bernstein two nights ago He gave
us a name

(reading from notes)
Alex Shipley

Bates and Kunkel shoot each other an amazed look Felt’s face
simply doesn’t move

KUNKEL
Where’d you get that

WOODWARD
He’s the Assistant Attorney General
of Tennessee

BATES
We know who he is

WOODWARD
But is Shipley an FBI target

KUNKEL BATES
No comment We’re not going to comment on
that

FELT
I’m not going to comment on that

WOODWARD
Shipley told my colleague--

KUNKEL
You already spoke to Shipley

WOODWARD
Shipley was recruited - they tried
to recruit him - to perform
political espionage on behalf of
the Nixon administration He gave
us the name of the recruiter

pieces but it runs all over the
map

(--)
Everything was part of it It’s a
monster

(then)

The truth could ruin the
administration and I mean ruin
(Woodward just looks at

him then--)

WOODWARD
How high Does it go

And Felt a sudden recoil of shame regret--

FELT WOODWARD (CONTD)
I have to do this my way (flash of anger)
There’s no going back now

A MATCH FLARES Now we really see why Felt’s stretching this
out He’s nervous Afraid He seems thinner Worn

FELT

You still don’t understand what I’m
giving you

(--)
Watergate is just a little corner
of a massive conspiracy Campaign
spying and sabotage Everyone and
everything - and I mean everyone -
is involved

(Woodward scribbling)
The FBI did its job It’s all in
the files If you put out the right
story the public will scream The
Attorney General will have to let
me keep going

WOODWARD
When you do what are you going to
find

They look at each other thinking

FELT
This is dangerous stuff you’re
playing with Especially if it’s
known before November 7th

WOODWARD
(realizing)
Election day

FELT
The White House is behind
everything But if they get past
the election they’re home free
The President is safe

And now he realizes

WOODWARD
The President That’s how high

Felt turns away We think for good Then stops Leaning
against a car Bends his knees slowly lowers Until he’s
sitting on the cold cement Tired At the end of something

Woodward sits on the garage floor opposite him cross-legged

WOODWARD (CONT’D)

My editors know That I’m talking
to somebody

(Felt looks up sharply)
But not who They don’t ask Like
they’re afraid to know

(Felt looks furious)
Im not going to tell anyone who
you are That’s the deal I
understand

(--)
But they know it’s someone deep
inside Someone who can see
everything No one understands how
one person knows so much

FELT
No one can possibly know how much I
know

He means about everything of course Not just this A pause
then--

WOODWARD
With all this mystery there’s a
nickname for you at the paper
(--)
‘Deep Throat’

Felt stares at him As if not metabolizing As if not having
heard Then his look forms a shape distaste disgust

WOODWARD (CONT’D)
They didn’t know what else to call
you

HF HF

FELT
They shouldn’t have to call me
anything

for his new office He’s going to
turn the FBI into the KGB

SMITH
So it’s over
waitress wanders by)

FELT

Bring coffee

then to Smith)

Get out your notebook

then)

May 1969 And February 1971--

SMITH
Mark
stopping him - yes)

Are you sure about this

he’s very fucking sure of
this because--)

FELT
Between those dates White House
employees were wiretapped many of
them aides to the Secretary of
State And five reporters
Including the New York Times

SMITH
Youre kidding
(but Felt’s not kidding)

FELT
Some of the names of the targets
came down from Henry Kissinger

Pause Smith looks at him

SMITH
This is hard for you
FELT
What part

SMITH
All this truth Truth is hard for
you
(but now that he’s started
Felt wants to just keep
going)

FELT
The targets went from Kissinger to
the FBI And the FBI illegally
unconstitutionally and
reprehensibly bugged and taped and
secretly photographed and
memorialized every move those
people made Them and their wives
and their mistresses and homosexual
lovers

SMITH
Who did the wiretaps Mark

FELT
Bill Sullivan
(which now makes perfect
fucking sense)
It became a rogue FBI operation
Sullivan drove it Sullivan and the
White House By themselves

SMITH
What about you
(what about me)
What did you know

FELT
About everything else I knew every
sordid little detail But not this
They knew they couldn’t tell me
about this

SMITH
They couldn’t count on you

FELT
This is when the darkness started
to creep in This is when the rot
started to happen
(and a long pause now the
Big Truth coming)
The White House is packing all its

crimes in separate little boxes
(MORE )

FELT (CONTD)
Watergate the spying the
ugliness the rot Each thing ina
different box so no one can put it
together so no one sees it’s all
connected and no one will care
But it’s all the same big thing

Smith stares Humbled by all this truth himself now so--

SMITH
Watergate is just the gateway

Smith puts down a fork Or a cup

FELT

Do you know physics Sandy If you
tap repeatedly on the post of a
building and the beating is
relentless it creates a rhythm a
resonance-

(Felt starts to tap the

table slowly repeatedly

- tap tap tap)
If you do that long enough and
steadily enough it will feed-back
the frequencies will align the
molecules will scramble and the
whole thing - the whole building -
will come apart from the inside and
collapse in on itself And all come
tumbling down

(beat)
The molecules are beginning to
scramble The FBI is coming apart
You know where that takes us You
want a country this big this
angry this confused without a
police department

(--)
Sometimes we have to betray the
thing we love to save the thing we
love

Which triggers a momentary collapse in Felt A slow eye-
blink He pats his own head Then as quickly embarrassed--

SMITH
This - what you’re doing - will
bring down the whole house of
cards The President’s surveillance
mania

But then you already knew that

FELT
(tired)
The White House is a syndicate
Sandy It’s a criminal
organization
Can you get out the story before
Gray’s confirmation hearing

SMITH

FELT
We’ve gone over everything They’11l

GRAYS FLACK
What about this

And pulls out the Smith TIME Magazine story WE PUSH IN on

truth

139 INT SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - DAY 139

Gray is perspiring It’s going badly He’s like a boxer in

Arrayed before him seven US SENATORS a dozen
PHOTOGRAPHERS 100 SPECTATORS at his back CAMERA FINDS FELT
in the gallery

SENATOR 1

(irate a WoodwardWash

Post clipping in his

hands )
And what about the assertion in
this article that a White House
aide slipped Donald Segretti a
target of the Bureau’s Watergate
investigation copies of what the
FBI had

GRAY
(unsteady )
Uh we didn’t look into that

SENATOR 1
Why on earth not

GRAY
I’1l have to look into that

SENATOR 1
Did you know the White House had
your confidential files

Gray looks to Felt Felt glances away

GRAY
I did yes Senator
(and pauses unfocused
desperately wanting to
please)
Um let me tell you how it might
have happened

SENATOR 1
Please do
(and as we continue we
quickly see--)

140 EXT PARK WASHINGTON DC - DAY - LONG SHOT 140

Gray and Dean sitting side by side on a bench Gray carries a
briefcase Dean a big envelope As we’re hearing--

GRAY (OVER)

White House counsel John Dean told
me the White House wanted
everything the FBI had on
Watergate To help with its own
investigation

(should stop talking but)
It was the President’s wish So Mr
Dean took all those FBI files

Gray puts the briefcase on the ground Dean opens Looks
through the contents closes it again Now back to

THE HEARING
Close on FELT as--

SENATOR 1
I’m confused How did Mr Dean a
potential target of the
investigation come to possess FBI
files about that investigation

GRAY
Because I gave them to him

Something big is happening The room can feel it

SENATOR 1
(grave)
How many Bureau reports are we
talking about How many reports did
you give Mr Dean

GRAY
I believe it was eighty-two

SENATOR 1
As Acting Director of the FBI why
on earth would you do that

GRAY
Because I was told to

SENATOR 1
By who

GRAY

The President

That’s it The room ERUPTS But we’re holding on Felt

SENATOR 2
So if I have this right Mr Dean
purposely mis-led the FBI Lied to
them

GRAY
(before he thinks--)
I would have to conclude that
probably is correct yes sir

The room is electric As we start to intercut with--

INT CABIN - CHRISTMAS DAY 141

A dozen stockings dangle over a fireplace Gray - in cardigan
with reindeers - approaching with an armful of wrapping
paper Tosses it all onto the fire now contemplating the
flames as we go back to--

THE HEARING

GRAY
I do understand though that the
materials you’re talking about were
kept in a safe in the White House

SENATOR 2
And how would you know that

GRAY
I know because Mr Dean gave those
and other files to me
(and now back to--)

THE CABIN Where Gray is left standing at the fire cradling a
small stack of files stamped “TOP SECRET EYES ONLY” And
starts to read Then wishes he hadn’t

And now simply throws all that into the flames and now smash
back to--

THE HEARING

GRAY (CONT’D)
He told me they should never see
the light of day He told me to
‘deep six’ the files To destroy
them
(and then)
I burned them at my vacation home

There it is Like a bomb going off the room explodes Felt -
who set this up all along - is the one still point in the
room

NIXON (OVER)
Today in one of the most difficult
decisions of my presidency I
accepted the resignations of two of
my closest associates in the White
House -- John Ehrlichman Bob
Haldeman -- two of the finest

should do--

(Felt slows feels

Sullivan behind him)
And I tell him to get rid of
everyone In the interests of the
nation I didnt mean me of

Felt has reached the elevator He presses the button

SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
You dont have many friends left

(as Felt steps into the
elevator)

FELT

spreads it out on the table between them That one address
circled now “Genesis Commune Ben Lomand”

Hey look

A cloud of dust on the horizon Then a car snaking over the
intermeshed hills A government sedan We make out a MAN at
the wheel a female PASSENGER

JOAN
Oh my god

It’s my parents

FRIEND
Anti-Christ Really

How can you tell

JOAN

Joan defiant They half-dress Car stops Felt and Audrey get
out He in his FBI suit She with white gloves and pill box
hat

FRIEND
That’s your dad He’s gorgeous

Felt can’t get to Joan fast enough Walking first Then he
runs And without a word or permission he just wraps her and
the baby in his arms just like that And starts to cry And
by the sheer force of his love Joan relents and collapses
into him just like that

Audrey holds onto the car door paralyzed
WIDE and LONG - THREE HIPPIE MEN jogging out from the commune
FELT and JOAN

Felt takes off his jacket trades it for the baby Felt lifts
the baby to the sky laughing

They turn and walk to Audrey Felt holds the baby out to her
Audrey stares at the child Hands pinned to her sides

AUDREY

Felt presses the baby to Audrey’s breast takes one of her
arms and wraps it around the child

FELT (CONTD)
Audrey this is Ludi

JOAN
You sent the FBI after me
(Felt smiling shakes
No)
Then how did you find me

And Felt takes out one of the envelopes he’s been addressing

FELT

Felt opens his arms and pulls both his women into him The
two women collapsing against each other

visible but empty While--

Audrey on a bench Holding Ludi With her gloves and pill-box
hat Joan beside her

She’s a little drunk Joan knows Joan looks at her a little
sadly then at Felt--

JOAN
I had this feeling when I was
little that I couldn’t see into
his eyes That he didn’t approve of
me He was always holding me up to
some impossible standard

AUDREY

That was me

(--)
When you were sick and you were
little it was your father who
climbed into bed with you In his
shoes His holster His suit He’d
sit with you for hours and rock you
til you fell asleep again

Joan looks at Felt As if to ask what did you do

AUDREY (CONTD)

I used to dress you up Remember
how you used to come downstairs and
show off your new clothes

(Felt--)
He adored you He thought you could
be the first female President--

(--)
I wanted you to be like mea

hesitates then--

INT JOAN’S BUNK - GENESIS COMMUNE - SAME 148

JOAN
Daddy this is my friend He’s a
lawyer

GILLIES

Douglas Gillies
(and as Felt takes him in)

FELT
When did you graduate from law
school

GILLIES

Ten months ago
Felt sighs stands - has to stoop - shakes Gillies’ hand

GILLIES (CONTD)

Look I didn’t want to come You
stand for everything I despise I
came because I admire your
daughter and she asked me

(and Felt as if he simply

chose not to hear that

says--—)

FELT

Have a seat

(when he’s down)
I need to consult an attorney

(and hands him a dollar)
I am now protected by attorney-
client privilege Whatever I say to
you you can never tell a living
soul without my permission

GILLIES
I know that But why me

Felt looks at Gillies His strong almost Job-like presence
Felt shifts in his chair more and more uncomfortable

FELT

Because you are now - as my lawyer -
the only person in America I can
trust

(and doesn’t quite know

how to react to that

strange and terrible

irony)
I’ve been in the FBI Longer than
you’ve been alive I live according
to a code There are things an FBI
man does and doesn’t do It’s black
and white

(rambling)
But there’s loyalty And then
there’s duty There are things
bigger than ourselves Can you
understand that

GILLIES
Yes

FELT
I’ve done something - things - that
cannot be undone But I want to
know what I’ve done
(and looks up at him)
Am I the man I think I am

Pause Gillies takes in this man in obvious pain

GILLIES
You want to know about your soul
You want to know who is going to
forgive you

Felt looks through the slats in the barn wall Catches
fragments of Audrey quietly coming close trying to hear

FELT
(realizing)
I don’t need a lawyer I need a
priest

And now we begin to HEAR in PRE-LAP

NIXON (PRE-LAP) (OVER)

leave office before my term is
completed is abhorrent to every
instinct in my body

Lano cocks his head at the irony of the moment

LANO
You tell me You were the boss

FELT
Ill take my car

LANO
Why don’t you ride with me
(and Felt looks at Lano’s

car)
FELT
I’m not getting in there with you
LANO
I wouldn’t be here if you had a

choice

Audrey appears in the doorway

LANO (CONT’D)

Felt approaches marching down the hall Charlie Bates
nervously smoking intercepts

BATES
What are you doing You shouldnt
be here

FELT

They’re charging you
(and as Bates says
nothing)

Get out of my way Mr Bates

Felt marches for three FEDERAL PROSECUTORS huddling outside
the courtroom All hungry Top Guns in their early 30s

FELT (CONT’D)
Which one’s Pottinger

STAN POTTINGER 33 hip-smart New Yorker turns

POTTINGER
Jesus look who’s here Mark Felt
What are you doing here

FELT
I’m going to testify

POTTINGER
We didn’t subpoena you

FELT
I’m aware of that
(looks over at Bates anda
few others)
They were following orders Why
don’t you go after the guy who was
giving them

GARDNER
(Prosecutor BILL GARDNER)
And who’s that you

POTTINGER
Don’t answer that
(steps closer)
Where’s your lawyer

FELT
I am a lawyer

POTTINGER
Where is your lawyer

FELT
I don’t need one

GARDNER
You will now

Pottinger pulls Felt out of earshot

POTTINGER

I can wallpaper my house with a
list of the civil rights the FBI
violated If it were up to me you
and Hoover and Bill Sullivan would
rot in jail

(--)
But it’s in your interests - and
for some reason the Attorney
General thinks it’s in the nation’s
- to keep you out of it

FELT

I was keeping you and your kids
safe at night But what you’re
doing--

(points at the agents)
--is a witch-hunt

It happened I made it happen Put
me on the stand I’1l take my
chances with the jury

INT GRAND JURY ROOM - DAY 154

Felt ram-rod straight in the witness chair Alone before the
23 diverse and sleepy AMERICANS of the grand jury

We’re deep into Felt’s testimony

POTTINGER
Counter-espionage expert Nazi-
hunter--

(half-facetious)
You are the G-Man’s G-Man Mr
Felt A patriot and a hero And we
are a grateful nation

One or two jurors actually applaud Gardner stands

GARDNER

Ladies and gentlemen for the last
few weeks you have heard through
testimony the sounds of the bombs
of the PLO and Weather Underground
ringing in your ears People died
We were a nation at war at home
and abroad We don’t dispute that
Now we ask you to listen for the
sound of the Constitution

(pauses for effect)
Hear that It doesnt make quite as
much noise as a bomb does it It
just sits there silent like our
conscience as its done for two
hundred years

(turns to Felt)
Mr Felt on September 8 1972 did
you instruct 143 FBI agents across
the country to break into the homes
of relatives of alleged members of
the Weather Underground to wiretap
their phones and bug their homes

FELT
Yes
GARDNER FELT (CONTD)
Who else (combative)
Who else what
GARDNER
Participated in giving those
orders

(Felt says nothing so--)
Assistant Director Edward Miller

INTERCUT MILLER leaning against a wall in the hallway Then--

I gave the order

GARDNER
Acting Director L Patrick Gray

INTERCUT GRAY sitting in his barcalounger at home Then--

FELT
I gave the order

GARDNER
Charles Bates
(INTERCUT Bates at his
desk at the FBI)

GARDNER (CONTD)
You’re going to just take the
bullet for everybody

FELT
I gave the order

Pause Enough Now Pottinger is up

POTTINGER
You mentioned you frequently
briefed the Nixon White House
during the case While we’re on
that subject why don’t you give us
a quick snapshot of how that
worked

FELT
I was in constant contact with the
White House on many matters

And then this thing happens to Felt For the first time his
curtain of impenetrability drops His eyes lose focus He
begins to sweat His hands clench Slacken Clench and--

FELT (CONTD)
In fact I was in the Oval Office
so often people used to say I had
to be Deep Throat
(a hesitation-what-then)

POTTINGER
What did you just say

FELT
I said I was with the White House -
Dean and so forth - so often people
thought I was the Washington Post
source for Watergate The guy they
called Deep Throat

Stop Pottinger just stares Confused by what he’s heard
Then because he’s not sure what else to do--

POTTINGER
(to the Grand Jury)
Before we dismiss the witness are
there any question from the jury

MIDDLE-AGED JUROR raises his hand

JUROR
Well were you

FELT
Was I what
(and who are you to ask me
a thing--)

JUROR
Were you Deep Throat
(and--)

STOP STAY ON POTTINGER A long silence His hands busy with
notes But Felt isn’t answering so now Pottinger looks up to-

FELT Who is looking down His face red Moist As--
POTTINGER leans forward now sensing something--

FELT
(weak)
No

POTTINGER
WAIT STOP
(and Pottinger leaps up
points at the steno)
Off the record

GARDNER POTTINGER (CONTD)
What the hell’re you doing I’m not sure--

What he’s doing is marching straight at Felt And we’re--

CLOSE ON FELT and POTTINGER Faces three inches apart A bead
of sweat traces down Felt’s forehead

POTTINGER (CONTD)
(low just them)

I’m going to remind you that
perjury is a Class A felony But I
also consider the question that man
just asked you outside the specific
scope of this investigation So if
it is your wish that I have the
question withdrawn and your answer
stricken from the record I will do
so I will make it like it never
happened No one will know

Felt won’t look Pottinger in the eye

POTTINGER (CONTD)
(whisper now)
I think I understand what’s at
stake here now Do you

A long excruciating beat Felt’s furious at himself

FELT
Withdraw the question

POTTINGER
I need you to repeat that I need
to be sure Say it again

FELT
Withdraw the question

POTTINGER
Jesus christ

Pottinger stares at Felt He now knows America’s most
dangerous and valuable secret The “Antichrist” is his
fucking hero Felt is Deep Throat

Felt emerges first with Audrey and Joan Millers next then
Gray and his wife Long walk down a dark corridor

To meet 300 FBI AGENTS spilling into the street

There is no noise This is eerie Then they begin to CLAP in
unison a long string of unending claps As Felt steps into
and through the crowd across this tableau

END CRAWL

Mark Felt was convicted of conspiracy for ordering
unconstitutional break-ins against the Weather Underground

fined and sentenced to 10 years in prison

Newly elected Ronald Reagan pardoned Felt in his first act
as President of the United States

Shortly after Audrey Felt shot herself in the head with
Felt’s FBI-issue revolver

In 2005 at the age of 92 Felt finally revealed he was the
Washington Post source on Watergate known as “Deep Throat”

Felt spent his last years living with his daughter Joan
and her children He died December 18 2008
