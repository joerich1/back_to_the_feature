SOLNESS
The funny thing is that Ive become so disturbed by younger
people

HILDE
What Younger people

SOLNESS

Yes they upset me so much that Ive sort of closed my doors here
and locked myself in Because Im afraid theyre going to come
here and theyre going to knock on the door and then theyre

going to break in

HILDE
Well I think maybe you should open the door and let them in

SOLNESS
Open the door

HILDE
Yes - so that they can just gently and quietly come inside and it
can be something good for you

SOLNESS
Open the door

CLOSE on Cornelia Srebnick 41 She’s humming softly We
MOVE out slowly to see she’s rocking the infant on a big
comfortable couch fionlled with baby blankets stuffed
animals and children’s books

We MOVE over to see Josh Srebnick 44 on the floor watching
her -- his expression a kind of awe She looks at him
hesitating taken by the intensity of his look A moment of
connection and warmth passes through her

He smiles softly back

CORNELIA
(to the baby)
There were three little pigs and they
made a house out of twigs and the
wolf came and
(to Josh)
Do you remember how it goes

JOSH
He blows it down

The baby starts to fuss

CORNELIA
Yeah But what happens in the
middle

JOSH
(thinks )
I keep wanting to do this little
piggie went to market but that’s with
the toes

The baby starts to cry

CORNELIA
The wolf keeps blowing the house in
The pigs keep making different
houses
(rocks the baby)
Ohshh shh shh

The baby is wailing Cornelia rocks her faster She looks
panicked

CORNELIA
What the fuck do we do

Josh doesn’t know Bang a door opens and a woman comes in
with a boppy strapped around her waist This is Marina
30s

MARINA
Okay who’s ready to eat
JOSH MARINA
Are we taking in or -- Who’s ready to eat

She sits down on the couch next to Cornelia lifts the
sobbing infant from out of Cornelia’s arms and places it on
the boppy The baby’s onesie has an image from The Clash’s
first album across the chest Marina opens her bra and gives
the baby her breast The baby nurses stretches and stops
crying

MARINA
Ha I love how she stretchesit’s
just like we do It’s so funny

It never occurred to me that
stretching is innate

She stretches imitating the baby Cornelia smiles politely
A curly haired man with glasses early 40’s enters Fletcher

FLETCHER
You want to see it

JOSH
Yeah

Fletcher sits near Josh

FLETCHER
It got infected with staph but it’s
not the bad staph

He pushes up his sleeve to reveal a square black and white
tattoo on his bicep

CORNELIA
What is it

FLETCHER
Guess
(to Josh)
You can come closer it’s not the bad
staph
Pink MARINA
I still don’t want the baby touching
it

He shoves his shoulder in Josh’s face

JOSH

FLETCHER
It’s Willow’s sonogram
JOSH

FLETCHER

I did it for Marina I was so
fucking proud of her

MARINA

understand

JOSH
Where do you even go for a tattoo

FLETCHER
I asked a guy at work and he told me
where his kids went Place in
Williamsburg Where else

MARINA
It’s a mother fucker -- it’s a ring
of fucking fire -- but it was the

most beautiful experience of my life

FLETCHER

love I’ve never felt I mean don’t
take that the wrong way Marina --

No it’s fine You know we --

She looks at Josh

JOSH MARINA
We It’s just such a game ‘
changer
We STAY on Josh and Cornelia’s faces
FLETCHER (0S)
When I saw her I thought “I know
you”
MARINA (0S)
It’s true I recognized her
immediately

FLETCHER (0S)
And because I’d been reading to her
in the womb she knew my voice

immediately
MARINA (0S) FLETCHER (0S)
It’s like in one moment I read her Stephen King’s The ‘
everything is different Tommyknockers

finished framed pictures lean against the wall projects
undertaken and abandoned Some nice stuff a couple of
antique chairs or a table A water stain untended to on the

JOSH

There’s like an oven that’s too hot
Josh shrugs Silence

CORNELIA

You don’t want kids right

(Josh hesitates)
Because I don’t

(they both hesitate)
I’m sorry I feel so guilty for
saying that I mean I did If we’d
had the magic sexy version and one

day suddenly had a baby But all
those drugs and shots and
miscarriages -- I don’t want to do it

again and it not to work

JOSH
I know
(beat )
And I like our life as it is

CORNELIA
(relieved)
Me too

JOSH
I don’t want things to be different
than they are right now

CORNELIA
I know I mean if we wanted to take
off for Paris tomorrow we could

JOSH
Yeah I mean I think it would be hard
to find an affordable fare on such
short notice but yeah

CORNELIA
No I know and I couldn’t leave work
JOSH
If we were going to do it we should
plan it at least a month in advance

CORNELIA
A month is still in the realm of
spontaneity

JOSH
No I know I mean the time we
spent in Rome what was that --

CORNELIA

JOSH
(can’t believe it)
It wasn’t 2006

CORNELIA
Yeah because I was working with my
dad on his dance film

JOSH
Rome was eight years ago already
Shit

CORNELIA

Yeah I looked at the pictures
recently and we’re two younger people
standing at the Treve Fountain

JOSH
We look similar

CORNELIA
We look younger
(pause)
I tried to get you to go to Mexico
last summer --

JOSH
I needed to finish my documentary

CORNELIA
But you didn’t finish it

Josh lies on his back and shuts his eyes
Cornelia gets in bed and clicks on her bedside lamp which
lights up nearly everything Josh places his arm over his

INT JOSHCORNELIA APT - HOME OFFICE DAY 4

Josh paces back and forth in his home-office His editor
Tim early 30’s sits at a desk-top attached to a series of
drives A tousled scholar Ira Mandelstam 50’s talks
gravely on a TV screen
SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
There was a poll conducted in 1987 in
which people were given a series of
phrases and asked which ones could be
found in the US Constitution --

JOSH
Let me see the continuity

SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
One of the phrases that got the
highest percentage of votes was
“From each according to his ability
to each according to his need”
This of course is not to be found
in the Constitution but is the
famous Communist credo popularized by
Karl Marx

Josh takes the sheet and holds it about two feet from his
face He squints

JOSH
Why do they type this stuff so small
TIM
I think that’s 12 point That’s
normal
SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN) JOSH
However when this phrase was That is not 12 that’s at
presented to people as a most eight Look at it it’s
tenet of Communism they of tiny

course overwhelmingly
rejected it

TIM
We need to cut away from Ira here
because

We hear a ringing On the SCREEN the scholar goes into his
pants pocket and retrieves a cell phone from a few years ago

SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
Hold on

He looks at it like he’s never seen anything like it before
He puts on reading glasses and very deliberately presses
Talk

SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
HelloEvelyn I’m doing an
interviewDid you look in the car
This is every fucking day sweety

fucking chain around your neck

Sorry

Sweety if you don’t stop this I’m
going to fucking screa --

Tim freezes the image on the screen

JOSH
We could cut to me asking the
question about hermeneutics

TIM
We could but you look like this in
that footage --

He shows an image of a younger Josh in a goatee and Jew-fro

TIM
It’s from eight years ago And the
previous shot of you asking any
relevant questions is this --

He pulls up an image of Josh with short hair and his arm in a
sling

JOSH
That’s from when I fell down the
subway stairs at Grand Army Plaza
The blizzard of 06 You remember how
icy that was

We CUT between a series of Joshes from over the years
Different hair lengths a beard a brief moustache a black
eye

JOSH
You remember I was trying my part on
the other side

Tim doesn’t

JOSH

rationalizing)

in the computer screen)

me”

(glances out at the small

crowd having made it

through the French part)
This is a quote from Jean-Luc Godard
Now what do we think about this
Can a documentary be personal

is filming him with a portable camera Josh is momentarily
distracted

in front of me by two rottweilers

(she starts to laugh)
I don’t know why I’m laughing It’s

were walking our poodle which I had
named Toto and these two rottweilers
came bounding out of an open gate and
just attacked My dad flagged down a
passing car and we climbed in the

Josh and Cornelia sit next to each other Josh is in the
middle of talking to Jamie and Darby who face them across the
table

JOSH
-I’ve learned along the way that
you can discover more by not knowing
the answers by allowing yourself to
be surprised by what you encounter

Jamie nods with great interest

JAMIE
Yeah yeah

JOSH
Sometimes that means waiting years
for something to happen I don’t
know I could go on about this stuff
for days

JAMIE
How did you start out like who
influenced you

JOSH
Oh I steal from everyone you know

JAMIE

to Josh)
Josh what’s your new film about

JOSH
Well I’m trying to solve the problem
that Eisenstein never solved -- that

is how to make a film that is both
materialist and intellectual at the
same time --

a text and starts to reply Jamie yawns openly
he’s losing his audience but keeps going

JOSH

It’s about the distinctly American
relationship between biography and
history theory and method and how
that relates to power and class in our
country particularly the political
military and economic elite

(sensing he’s lost them)
It’s really about America
Blue 16

Jamie takes out a pad and pen and scribbles something down

JAMIE
Eisenstein is astonishing I just
saw Strike I’m obsessed with Europe
in the 20’s see The interwar
period ex-patriots that sort of
thing

DARBY
I keep trying to get Jamie to do
something with before and afters
All humans love before and afters
Any TV show with before and afters
will succeed

Before you said that

INT VICTORIAN HOUSE BROOKLYN NIGHT 30

A circle of kneeling people all dressed in white It’s
whatever white they had available at home so it’s mismatched

A tall thin guy 30’s with pale skin and long black hair
kneels at a make-shift shrine This is the shaman In front
of him is an altar decorated with crystals and laminated
cards of St Francis Gandhi Merlin King Tut

Josh leans over to Cornelia

JOSH
How did King Tut become magical all
of a sudden

Jamie in a white Puma track-suit leans forward over a
couple of people on Josh’s other side

JAMIE
It’s because they discovered his tomb
in the occult boom of the 20s

“Shhh” from the group

The shaman pops open what looks like a Coke bottle and pours
a brown sludgy liquid into a shot glass He says a
benediction People in succession crawl over to him he
does a blessing of sorts on their forehead and hands them the
glass They drink and return to their original spots

We watch as Jamie Darby Cornelia and Josh drink the dark
sludge

Jamie drinks without thought
Darby does the quotes thing in the air before she drinks

DARBY
This is our twenties

CORNELIA
I’m forty-one

Cornelia sips it She looks up at the shaman who smiles
encouragingly She downs it and hands it back to him
proudly

Josh hesitates looks back at the group He shrugs and downs
it a significant portion missing his mouth He quickly
wipes at his chin and tries to get the spillage back into his
mouth He licks his fingers and palm and the sides of the
glass then hands the glass back to the shaman who looks
mildly irritated

They’re back in their circle The woman next to Josh
whispers

WOMAN
Supposedly everyone sees Egyptian
imagery

JOSH
Oh yeah

WOMAN
I want to clear some father issues
You

JOSH

Oh I don’t know

WOMAN
It’s good to have a focus

JOSH
(thinks about it)
Fear of death You know linear time
not being such a big deal

The lights are lowered The shaman’s assistant clears the
air with an eagle feather

JOSH
(whispers )
What’s the bucket for

WOMAN
Puking

People “shhh” Josh The shaman goes around the room and
makes a cross on everyone’s forehead Josh closes his eyes

The FOLLOWING is in choppy almost impressionistic images

People start to trip Darby gets up and joins a couple who
is dancing

SHAMAN
We are purging dark energies past
pain
He plays some bongos and shakes a shaker
DARBY
(under her breath)
This shaman is kind of a d-bag

The woman next to Josh grabs a bucket and pukes

JOSH
That’s my bucket

SHAMAN

CUT TO Josh opens his eyes The room is a blur -- white
figures drifting past Josh gets up

Cornelia talks with the shaman in a corner Josh waves her
over madly She excuses herself

JOSH
Maybe don’t flirt with the shaman

CORNELIA
He was telling me about his boat

Cornelia grows quiet Her eyes are glazed

JOSH

CORNELIA
I wish you’d look at me the way you
look at Jamie and Darby

JOSH

CORNELIA
No you don’t You used to When we
first met you were like you are with

emails

JOSH

the time

CORNELIA

enthusiasm for Jamie and Darby I’m

CUT TO Darby leans her head against the wall She talks to

the man next to her

DARBY
I was falling asleep today on the L
train and you know how your brain
gets in these loops I couldn’t

of things Do you find that

She vomits

chance I’m fine with that

the ice cream on the bed-side table

CUT TO Josh shoots Jamie Tipper shoots Kent Kent sits up
in bed he talks somberly Jamie sits at his bed-side

KENT
A ceramic platter didn’t break and
accidentally cut both my wrists

JAMIE
No

KENT
No I’ve been unhappy I did it to
myself I cut my wrists

JAMIE
You broke a ceramic platter and used
the shards to cut your wrists

Josh starts to say something he knows where Kent’s going
with this but he holds himself back

KENT
No there was no ceramic platter I
mean there is I had one in mind
when I was telling the story

JAMIE
But the shards were from the platter

JOSH
(can’t help himself)
What Kent is saying is he imagined an
actual platter to make his story feel
more authentic but really he just
cut his wrists with what probably a
razor blade

Kent and Jamie look over at Josh Kent looks annoyed
Blue 62

KENT
(to Jamie)
Who is he

himself

JAMIE
You had written a poem for English

this beautiful poem Do you know

effective “I want to be
unbridgeable” That one line got me
through my mother’s illness

KENT
Yeah I don’t know why I stopped
writing poetry I stopped doing a
lot of things Why do we stop doing
things I guess life happens

JAMIE
Life is other plans

JAMIE
Thank God I’ve got you Joshy We
did what you said we didn’t know the
answers we discovered it I should
get a good book on Afghanistan And
war in general I really know so
little about it

JOSH
(decides to go for it)
You know who you should talk to Ira
Mandelstam the guy in my film he
could tell you a lot about war and
the politics of war

JAMIE
That’s your guy though Joshy I
can’t take your guy

Blue 67

JOSH

afraid

JOSH

(snapping)

I can’t fucking believe his idiotic
Facebook idea paid off It’s so
fucking stupid And my thing is a
mess A total fucking mess

(pause)
Sorry I feel bad saying that But I
also hate the fact he’s calling his
band Cookie O’Puss

CORNELIA
What’s wrong with that

JOSH
It’s just some funny old kitschy
thing to him he saw on YouTube But
that was my commercial I actually
experienced it You know

CORNELIA
I don’t know from Cookie Puss

JOSH
Really It was for Carvel Cookie
Puss was the original one but they
did an ice cream cake for Saint
Patrick’s Day and it was this
floating green Irish cake that said
“My name is Cookie O’Puss”

Cornelia is silent

JOSH
(exhales )
I’m being ridiculous I probably
don’t mean any of it

CORNELIA
My dad likes to say “The more the
more”

JOSH
That’s because your dad has
everything And then he gets more
(off her look)
No he’s right There’s enough to go
around for everyone

JAMIE
Or I can take ten years

Josh hesitates taken aback Jamie laughs

JAMIE
I’m fucking with you Joshy Your
thing is going to be totally
brilliant

They reach the doorway of the office building Jamie takes
the big headphones from around his neck and puts them on
Josh Jamie presses Play “Eye of The Tiger” by Survivor

I remember when this song was just
considered bad But it’s working

opportunity You’re friggin’ Josh

INT OFFICE HEDGE FUND DAY 47

Josh shakes hands with a bulky fratty looking hedge fund guy
30’s in a suit This is Dave

Josh sits on a couch Dave in an armchair Dave drinks from
a highball glass
He drinks

HEDGE FUND DAVE
You see Mad Men

JOSH
No

HEDGE FUND DAVE
(waves it off)
It’s really apple juice Nah it’s
whiskey Nah it’s not It is

HEDGE FUND DAVE
So tell me more about your project

JOSH
Well maybe a good way to start is by
asking you a question

HEDGE FUND DAVE
Hey they were all raped when I got
there

Josh stares at him blankly

HEDGE FUND DAVE
(re highball)
This is my second in twenty minutes
Shoot

JOSH
Do you know the percentage of African

American adult males currently in jail

HEDGE FUND DAVE
I dont

JOSH
Take a guess

HEDGE FUND DAVE
(playing along but not
really thinking)
Like 60

JOSH
Jesus no
(pause)
Its over 9 Thats nearly 1 in 10
African American adult males nearly
a million and half

HEDGE FUND DAVE
A million and a half is a lot

JOSH
Its insane but people dont realize
this They think because we have a
black president

HEDGE FUND DAVE
(as if hes helping Josh
out)
So this is about prison Like a
black Shawshank But real A real
black Shawshank

JOSH
(thrown )
No notno
(pause and then speaking
quickly)
Theres a section an Entracte
really on the function of race in
the prison industrial complex
(trying to get back on

track)
But the film is really about how
power in America works Do you know

the historian Ira Mandelstam

HEDGE FUND DAVE

Yeah
JOSH
(pleased)
Really
HEDGE FUND DAVE
No

JOSH
Well we have over a hundred hours of
interviews with him Now --

HEDGE FUND DAVE
The movie’s a hundred hours

JOSH
No we’ll cut it Now this guy
he’s not particularly charismatic
he’s kind of anti-social maybe
asbergers but not interesting
asbergers He’s kind of boring even
But he’s a charismatic thinker

HEDGE FUND DAVE
How do you show what he thinks
Cartoons

JOSH
(what )
No not cartoons He says it

HEDGE FUND DAVE
But he’s boring

JOSH
Wellyes but like many boring
things the longer you watch it it
takes on a different dimension --

Josh wipes the sweat that has now accumulated on his face
Dave’s glance goes to his Blackberry He types something
quickly

HEDGE FUND DAVE
Mmm hmm So what’s it about

JOSH
It’s really a very simple idea The
three sections correspond to the
three nodes of what Mills called the
power elite the political military
and economic But and this is key
each part has to interconnect to show
how none of these three nodes
functions without the other

Dave tries to surreptitiously glance at his Blackberry

JOSH
It’s a linear film of course but I
imagine it as a kind of hypertext
To be clear the film is really about
the working class and I can’t speak
on behalf of the working class I
can’t make their film of course
They have to be felt as the
impossible subject of the text
Through an examination of the power
structure the voice of the working
class has to be revealed in the
margins through its very absence If
that makes sense

The phone rings Both Dave and Josh look at it

HEDGE FUND DAVE
Hey I’m suddenly so popular

JOSH
(barrels on)
But it’s not even really about the
power structure but about what it
means to make a film about it It’s
about the very possibility of making
this filmIt’s really about America

Dave can’t help it He lunges for the phone
The sound of KNOCKING

Josh nervously unstraps his bike helmet and puts on his hat
An awkward exchange as he has trouble holding both He
exhales Breitbart finally accommodates by taking the helmet

JOSH
Would you watch what I have I think

JOSH
Okay

Breitbart goes to his kitchen Josh waits impatiently

BREITBART (0S)
Well you have a lot of good material
there

JOSH
Uh huh

BREITBART (0S)
Lots to think about I need to
process it

JOSH
Uh huh

Breitbart reappears in the kitchen doorway

BREITBART
Do you need the stuff about Turkish
politics

JOSH
Yes because it connects to what he’s
saying about the shift in power in the
contemporary global economy And of
course it relates back to the earlier
stuff on the Ottoman Empire

BREITBART
Right but it feels like a detour
What about the lengthy history of the
Triangle Shirtwaste Factory Fire Do
you need that

JOSH
The interview with Tillie
Kupferschmidst’s great great niece
That’s the emotional center of the
movie That’s where things come
together Without that scenewhy
make the film at all

BREITBART
But it’s too long

JOSH
It has to be long The point is it
makes you uncomfortable

BREITBART
(gently )
I wasn’t uncomfortable I was bored

The kettle goes off Breitbart goes back into the kitchen
Josh follows him in

JOSH
Well maybe boredom is your defense
from the discomfort

BREITBART
(growing impatient)
You just showed me a six and a half
hour movie that runs about seven
hours too long I’m trying to help

JOSH
I understand I understand I think I
need to shoot some more interviews --

BREITBART
(quickly)
Don’t shoot anymore You have enough

JOSH
Yeah I just don’t think you’re
getting it or maybe there’s something
about me or what you saw that’s
clouding your judgement

BREITBART
I’m telling you what I really feel

JOSH
I don’t believe it I think you’re
being deliberately critical

BREITBART
Josh I’m trying to help you

JOSH
Bullshit Is it because Cornelia and
I didn’t have children

BREITBART
Oh come on Josh
JOSH
We tried There were miscarriages
I had to give her a shot in her ass
every day for three months It’s a
huge fucking needle

BREITBART
I didn’t know you tried so hard She
didn’t tell me I thought you guys
didn’t want kids

JOSH
We didn’t want to hope for something
we probably couldn’t have
(collecting his things)
This was a mistake

BREITBART
I’m sorry you feel that way

Josh starts for door

JOSH
I know you think I didn’t reach my
potential

BREITBART
No son no I don’t think you did
(beat )
Your first film was so wonderful and
entertaining We recognized ourselves
in it This is ungenerous it’s like
you took your ball and went home

you guys are

sleeve from a Wilco CD off of a table He smiles

How is she

FLETCHER
(looks down at her)
Pretty good Cool baby To be
honest though it’s a little hard
for me to relate to an infant

JOSH
It seems kind of cool though

FLETCHER
It’s like the pregnancy is its own
thing You get so used to it After
a while I just felt we did this we
don’t actually need the baby

JOSH
(nods )
I’m sorry if I’ve appeared crazy
orI don’t know

FLETCHER
I’m sorry we didn’t invite you to the
party

JOSH
(shrugs )
I think I’ve been jealous of you guys
having a kid

FLETCHER
You know before you have a kid
everyone tells you “It’s the best
thing you’ll ever do” As soon as
you bring that baby back from the
hospital the same people say “Don’t
worry it gets better” It’s like
what the fuck was that all about
before

JOSH
Having Willow must have changed your
whole perspective on life

FLETCHER
(pause)
Not as much as I hoped it would
(lowering his voice)
I love my kid but I’m still the most
important person in my life

concentrated on the action

CORNELIA

There

BREITBART
Thank you

He looks at himself in the mirror and approves

BREITBART
It’s been very strange looking back
over my career How did I accomplish
all of that If I’m honest with
myself it sometimes took being a
selfish prick Of course you can’t
say that In my speech I attribute
it to talent work and luck It’s
something I don’t think your husband
realizes He still believes the
speeches

CORNELIA
When I first started dating him he
reminded me so much of you

BREITBART
His problem is he wants what I have
but he’s not merciless enough to get
it

CORNELIA

(simply and sadly)
You know I am disappointed in Josh
On some level I feel like he failed
But I don’t know if I actually feel
that because I feel that or I feel it
because he does Either way it’s a
terrible thing to think about your
husband

BREITBART
You know Josh told me I didn’t
know you miscarried

CORNELIA
A few times The magic of youth is
that every decision is the right one
and you don’t have to make any of
them The terror of adulthood is
there are limited options and you
have to pick

BREITBART
There’s no magic in being old Some
asshole tried to offer me a seat on
the subway yesterday

She smiles She takes her phone from her pocket and checks
it No calls

about Darby’s childhood as if it was

Josh takes a seat and crosses his legs comfortably

JOSH
Go ahead

They all look at him and then Jamie blankly
JAMIE

Not all of the stuff in my movie
happened exactly as I said it did

(sighs)
I played around with some of the time-
line
BREITBART
Okay
JAMIE
(humb1ly )
Yeah
JOSH
“Yeah” And
JAMIE
And what
JOSH
You did a lot more than that come
on

Josh stands back up He says to the table
JOSH
He didn’t even know Kent Darby did
And Darby’s mother died of ovarian
cancer Jamie’s mom is probably
alive and kicking in Idaho

He sits back down

BREITBART
(trying to put an end to
it)
Josh this is kind of my night --

JOSH
You just need to hear this

JAMIE
That’s basically it

Josh leaps back up
JOSH

No that’s not basically it You
knew that Kent had tried to kill

himself

JAMIE
Right

JOSH
Say it

BREITBART

Josh come on let him speak

JAMIE
The gist is the same I authored a
bit of how we came to it I mean
I’m not that good a writer If I
made it all up I’d be the best
writer in Hollywood andand Kent
would be Marlon Brando

Breitbart laughs Hedge Fund Dave laughs harder

JOSH
I never said it was amazing I just
said it was faked

JAMIE
And some of the time-line was
adjusted --

JOSH
Stop with the time-line crap

Josh pulls out his video camera and gestures with it

Breitbart

JOSH
Jamie knew that Kent tried to kill
himself That he’d been in
Afghanistan We didn’t just stumble
upon it It was rigged Jamie
invented the whole Facebook thing
because he knew it would play better

HEDGE FUND DAVE
Kent wasn’t in Afghanistan

JOSH
No Kent was in Afghanistan

HEDGE FUND DAVE
So what’s the problem

JOSH
It’sit’sthe way the way he
said that he found him is not true

HEDGE FUND DAVE
Kent served our country you’re being
offensive

looks at Jamie

BREITBART
Is what Josh is saying true

JAMIE
WellI did know but I don’t think
it really matters though the movie’s
not about that

JOSH
Of course it matters Leslie
explain

BREITBART

I don’t know that it matters totally
in this case

JOSH
(shocked)
What

Dave leans in from the next table

HEDGE FUND DAVE
I don’t care

JOSH
(dismissive)
I didn’t expect you to care
(quickly back to Leslie)
Leslie are you kidding me You
don’t care You just gave a speech
about authenticity

HEDGE FUND DAVE
(thinks about it again)
Yeah I don’t care

BREITBART
I just think the movie works on many
levels the happenstance of it to be
honest I find the least interesting
part

Josh sputters practically stomps his foot

JOSH

I can’t believe it This movie isn’t
worth theRAMit’sstored on

(pointing at Jamie)
He’s a con artist Leslie your
generation of sit-ins and protesters
andpack rats would be horrified by
thisdemon

BREITBART
You’re hysterical Josh

JOSH
(hysterically)
I’m not hysterical

He swings his arm gesturing knocking a tray full of food
and glasses out of a waiter’s arms It goes crashing to the
ground

JOSH
Shit I’m sorry I’m sorry

He helps the waiter pick up the plates Everyone at the
table waits Josh finally gets back up

JOSH
Cornelia

CORNELIA
I don’t know I think he’s an
asshole but the movie’s pretty good
And I’m sorry I think that

Jamie takes a seat and starts eating the dessert that was
placed in front of him

JOSH
This is so frustrating I’m going to
get no satisfaction here am I This
guy’s just going to win no matter
what

Everyone at the table stares at Josh His says with
certainty

JOSH
This is not how the world works

We MOVE in on Josh His face fills with emotion

BREITBART
Why does it have to be one thing or
another Things change Different
things matter now

JOSH
Forget ethics then What about me
You played me I was played

JAMIE
(under his breath)
But you acted in it

JOSH
Only because I thought it was real
(pause with genuine
feeling)
I loved you

JAMIE
I like you too We’re friends

JOSH
(sadly)
I really believed it
(his throat full of
sadness)
I was a bet

BREITBART
Are you okay son

Blue 116

Josh wipes his face

JOSH
I’m not crying I’m not

Josh’s attention goes to a tiny camera in Jamie’s lap aimed
right at him

JOSH
Are you filming this

BREITBART
Josh your sleeve is on fire

Josh’s sweatshirt has dipped into the flame of a candle on
the table and is indeed on fire Jamie stands grabs a
pitcher of water and douses Josh

Josh drips soaked He shakes his head like a wet dog and
dejected moves to leave He hesitates and turns to Breitbart

JOSH
I took your note by the way I cut
the stuff on Turkish politics out of
my film You were right I don’t
need it

BREITBART
I’m glad to hear that son

Josh puts the video camera back in his tote He sits on the
steps with his roller blades and whiskey bottle Cornelia
arrives She holds a plate with a napkin covering it She
hands it to Josh

CORNELIA
It doesn’t matter that it’s faked
(Josh nods)
It doesn’t matter because it’s not
about Afghanistan and it’s not about
Kent it’s about Jamie

JOSH
(sighs)
In my head when I was blading over
I swept in here and exposed
everything I was such a hero

He lifts the napkin on the plate to see a piece of chocolate
cake drizzled with chocolate sauce and a fork

JOSH
Thanks

Cornelia takes a swig from the bottle

CORNELIA
When we first started seeing each
other I was so jealous I would get
so upset when you’d talk to another
girl at a party

JOSH
I know I liked that

CORNELIA
I was so sure you’d fall in love with
someone else and leave me

JOSH
Did you want me to

CORNELIA

I think I wanted to know that I
wasn’t your only option But you
didn’t fall in love with someone
else Until you did And then it
was two people

(beat )
I’m so sorry I kissed him I really
did think it was you at firstthen
I kind of kissed him again I don’t
know why I did it I wanted to like
him as much as you did

Josh starts to eat the cake

JOSH
(mouth full)
I wanted so badlyI wanted to be
admired I wanted a protege

CORNELIA
I know

JOSH
He looked at me like I was a real
grown-up person Someone who has
done things For the first time in
my life I stopped thinking of myself
as a child imitating an adult
Blue 118

CORNELIA
You feel that way too

JOSH
(nods )
I’m forty-four and there are things I
will never do Things I won’t have
(pause)
What’s the opposite of “the world’s
your oyster”

Cornelia’s eyes water She nods

CORNELIA
I think I stopped taking you in

JOSH
Am I a failure

CORNELIA
Youve never failed me

JOSH
But am I a failure

CORNELIA
I feel like I failed you I wish we
could go back and meet each other all
over again

JOSH
I’‘d present myself differently So I
didn’t get your hopes up Maybe not
use the expression “conquer the
world” so often

CORNELIA
You said that a lot

JOSH
I think it’s hard for me to have
something be great every day and to
acknowledge it

(smiles at her)

I have something great every day If
we were different people I’d ask you
to renew our vows

CORNELIA
I think it’s nice to renew vows

JOSH
Maybe we are different people
