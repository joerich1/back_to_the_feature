housing crisis in the middle of the
biggest boom anybodyd ever seen Why

ROBERT (0S)

Im a child of the 50s My father
welded steel for the Navy And my
mother worked at the VA

INT ROBERTS MANSION - DAY
As the conversation continues we see

1 A MAID clean an expansive living room waxing a mahogany
table

2 A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting
room

3 An overhead shot as a SERVANT carries packages up a long
winding staircase

ROBERT
They lived through the Depression
Pearl Harbor and the Bomb And they
didnt think bad things might
happen they knew they would happen

MARIA
Is that whats happening now

ROBERT
When I was a kid my favorite
teacher was Mr James Mr James

said that world events always

revolve around five things

(extending his fingers one-
BY-ONE)

INT ROBERTS LIVING ROOM - DAY

And right on cue we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER -- sitting on a sofa across from MARIA BARTIROMO and a
CAMERA CREW mid-interview ELLEN MILLER watches on a
nearby MONITOR

MARIA
(LAUGHING)
Was this freshman econ

ROBERT
This was fifth-grade econ
(smiles off her laugh)
But this is something weve seen
over and over again time and time
again that competition for this--
limited amount of dollars out
there can make even the best of us
manic So its not surprising that
we see these asset bubbles but
when reality sets in of course
they burst

CLOUDS GIVE WAY TO A
FALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH

this would mean

tranquility and finally just finally Robert has a

respite as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids nodding off

EXT PARK BENCH - DAY

SYD FELDER sits next to Robert
SYD
Hypothetically the situation
youre describing would be
involuntary manslaughter

ROBERT
And such a person

SYD
would be in a lot of trouble
especially if that person was closing
a merger with a large public bank
where any publicity or arrest could
delay or derail the transaction
(MORE)
Goldenrod - 41711 35
SYD (CONTD)
But thats only if there was some
evidence that could link him to
the crime

ROBERT
Fingerprints DNA

SYD
Very hard to collect after an explosion
The real worlds different from television

ROBERT
What about cell phone records

SYD
Did this person make any calls from the area

ROBERT
Not from a cell phone no

SYD
Then they wont be able to place him there

ROBERT
What would you advise such a person
to do

SYD
To confess immediately

ROBERT
Failing which

SYD
To put as much distance between himself
and the event as possible if possible
But let me tell you something and Im
speaking to you as a friend now there
are about fifty things that person
wouldnt have thought of And the more
time that passes the more lies that
are told the worse it gets for him

Robert stands

SYD (CONTD)

trouble If we talk to them now we
can probably work it out

You tell me what happens if the
Standard deal does not close and I
gotta tell my investors about our
real losses

SYD
Nothing good

ROBERT
And whatd you say about the Justice
Department Depending on what they
decide to arrest me on-- fraud
conviction gets me twenty years

SYD
I did

its in Russia its under-
exploited- theres billions under
the ground and to get it out all
we need is a couple hundred
million you put in a hundred
well put in a hundred- well
triple it all in six months So I
go check it out And the geological
surveys right friendly
government And to lock it in you
hedge it right Sell the copper
ahead on the commodities exchange
and it all works its fine and
youre making a fortune

accounted for-- variation margin--
and that friendly Russian
government all of a sudden not so
friendly anymore and theyre
blocking the export of the copper
so I gotta make it up I gotta put
