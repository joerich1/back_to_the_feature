EXT THE STEEL MILLS LOOM - LONG SHOT - DUSK

a ne

Graphic says Northern Indiana sometime in the 1940 Ss

FADE UP TO FIND Hohman a steel town squatting beside
Lake Michigan CAMERA PANS the city then begins a
SERIES OF CUTS to show ever more microcosmic views of
Hohman The NARRATORS VOICE (JEAN SHEPHERD) fades

up We hear a MEDLEY OF CLASSIC CHRISTMAS CAROLS which
form a striking contrast to the images a

RALPHIE FLICK and SCHWARTZ run across a slag heap in
foreground RANDY trails behind

NARRATOR (V0O)
Hohman Indiana It clings
precariously to the underbody
of Chicago like a barnacle
clings to the retting hulk of
a tramp steamer On the far
horizon beyond the railroad
yards and the great refinery
tanks lay our own mysterious
private mountain range Dark
and mysterious cold and
uninhabited the steel mills
stacked like malignant dominces
against the steel gray skies

EXT JUNEYARD - DUSK
Kids run past delapidated fence

NARRATOR (VO Contd)
Barly December had seen the first
of the great blizzards of that
year ‘The wind howling down out
of the Canadian wilds a few
hundred miles to the North
screamed over frozen Lake
Michigan

Kids race by Randy trails

NARRATOR (VO Contd)

‘and hit Hohman laying on the town
great driftsof snow and long
storyhigh icicles and sub-zero
temperatures where the air cracked
and sang streetcar wires creaked
under caked ice and kids plodded
to school through 45 miles an hour
gales tilting forward like tiny
furred radiator ornaments

EXT DOWNTOWN HOHMAN - NIGHT

Filled with cars and shoppers

NARRATOR
But over it all like a ‘faint thin
offstage chorus was the building
excitement Christmas was on its
way Each day was more exciting
than the last because Christmas
was one day closer

EXT DOWNTOWN HOHMAN - TRACKING SHOT KIDS WEAVING

NARRATOR
Lovely beautiful glorious
Christmas around which the entire
kid year revolved Downtown Hohman
was prepared for its yearly
Bacchanalia of peace on earth and
good will to meh

EXT HIGBEE

SDEPT STORE

CAMERA CUTS TO A WIDE SHOT of Higbees Department
Store window Citizens stand “cohing and “aahing
in front of the Yule splendor CAMERA MOVES IN TOWARD
the window

NARRATOR
Higbees Department Stores corner
window was traditionally a major high
water mark of the preChristmas season
It set the tone the motif of their
giant Yuletide Jubilee Kids were
brought in from miles around just to
see the window

- 6

NARRATOR (VO Contd)

Qld codgers would recall vintage
years when the window had flowered
more fulsomely than in ordinary
times This was one of those years
The magnificent display had been
officially unveiled on a crowded
Saturday night It was an instant
smash hit

CAMERA PANS the rapt faces peering in One little boy
RALPHIE comes bobbing up between the legs of a startled
grownup We see FLICK SCHWARTZ and RANDY also

NARRATOR (Contd)
First nights packed earmuff to
earmuff their steamy breath
clouding up the sparkling plate
glass jostled in rapt admiration
before a golden tinkling panoply ©
of mechanized electronic joy

CAMERA PANS the window Over this SHOT we see the
OPENING TITLES

This is the heyday of the Seven Dwarfs and their virginal
den mother Snow White Walt Disneys seven cutie-pies
hammer and chisel and paint while Santa bouncing Snow
White on his mechanical knee hoheho’s through eight
strategically placed loudspeakers -- interspersed by
choruses of Heigh ho heigh ho its off te work we go
Grumpy sits at the controls of a miniature eight-wheel
Rock Island Road steam engine and Sleepy plays a marimba
while in the background inexplicably Mrs Claus
ceaselessly irons a red shirt Sparkling artificial
snow drifts down on Shirley Temple dolls Flexible
Flyers and Tinker Toy sets glowing in the golden spot-
light In the foreground a frontier stockade built of
Lincoln Logs is manned by a company of kilted lead
Highlanders whe are doughtily fending off an attack by
six US Army medium tanks (Histery has always been
vague in Indiana) A few feet away stands an Arthurian
cardboard castle with Raggedy Andy sitting on the draw-
bridge his feet in the moat through which a Lionel
freight train burping real smoke goes round and round
Dopey sits in Amos and Andys pedal-operated Fresh Air
Taxicab beside a stuffed panda holding a lollipop in

his paw bearing the heart-tugging legend Hug Me”

From fluffy cotton clouds above Dionne quintuplet
dolls wearing plaid golf knickers hang from billowing
parachutes having just bailed out of a high-flying —
balsawood Fokker triplane All in all Santas workshop
makes Salvador Dali look like Norman Rockwell
NARRATOR
It was a good year Maybe even
a great one Like a swelling
Christmas balloon the excitement
mounted until the whole town
tossed restlessly in bed -- and
madeplans for the big day
Already my own scheme was well
under way a scheme whose
Machiavellian brilliance and
Olympian perserverance made that
Christmas stand out among -
Christmases past
CAMERA PANS FROM Ralphies rapt fact TO the beaming
face of Red Ryder who is hustling the Daisy BB rifle
to aching kids everywhere We DISSOLVE TO the entranced
face of Ralphie
INT RALPH PARKERS HOUSE DAY 7

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that Ralphie is reading
Boys Life Downstairs we hear the hectic routine of
a school morning The omnipresent RADIO CRACKLES in the
background Ralphies FATHER hereafter known as The
Old Man roars dimly in the distance as he fights the
good fight against the indefatigable Indiana winter
Ralphies MOTHER calls intermittently the waning minutes
before school deadline

NARRATOR
I remember clearly itchingly
nervously maddeningly the first
time laid eyes on it pictured
in a three-color smeared
illustration in a full-page back
cover ad in Boys Life

CAMERA CUTS to Ralphies POV and STARTS A SLOW ZOOM

INTO the smiling face of Red Ryder We see the follow-
ing copy on the page

BOYS

AT LAST YOU CAN OWN AN OFFICIAL RED RYDER CARBINE

ACTION TWO HUNDRED SHOT RANGE MODEL AIR RIFLE

NARRATOR (Contd)
Red Ryder his jaw squared

staring out at me manfully and
speaking directly to me eye to
eye In his hand was “the knurled
stock of as beautiful as coolly
deadly looking a piece of
weaponry as Id ever laid eyes on

CAMERA PANS OVER its page seeing the following copy
as we hear Ralphie begin reading it out loud to himself

RALPH (0S)
Yes fellows this two-hundred
shot carbine action air rifle

my range wars chasin them
rustlers and bad guys can be

built-in secret compass in the
stock for telling the direction

sundial for telling time out in
the wilds You just lay your
cheek gainst this stock sight
over my own special design
Cloverleaf sight and you just

gift

fhe SOUND of Ralphs VOICE REVERBERATES AND ECHOES

RALPH(OS)
(continuing)

Make a swell Christmas gi

Make a swell Christmas

CAMERA CUTS TO Ralphie and begins a SLOW ZOOM INTO his

eyes

NARRATOR
A swell Christmas gift Here
was Red Ryder himself nailing
me his pal Ralphie with his
calculatingly demonic underplay
- knowing full well that it was
not merely a swell Christmas gift
but the Christmas gift -- the
quintessential Christmas gift
the Holy Grail of Christmas gifts
For the first time in my life the
initial symptoms of genuine lunancy
of mania set in

CAMERA HAS ARRIVED AT AN EXTREMELY CLOSE SHOT of
Ralphies eye We DISSOLVE to the following which
is Ralphies daydream fantasy

DISSOLVE TO

INT RALPHS KITCHEN EXTREME CLOSEUP RALPHIES EYE - 8

D

CAMERA PULLS BACK to see Ralphie on one knee his trusty
Red Ryder air rifle at the ready As CAMERA CONTINUES
TO PULL BACK we see Ralphies Father huddle in the corner
his arms about Ralphies Mother whose eyes roll with
cosmic fear At her feet RANDY Ralphies brother is
clasped in his mothers desperate arms his fingernails
poised before his chattering teeth His eyes staré as
if they beheld the coming of the millenium Ralphies
Father speaks
FATHER

For your mothers sake

CLOSEUP RALPHIE

NARRATOR
With Herculean ¢caim Ralphie turns
to them

RALPHIE

Dont worry Dad As long as I
got O1 Blue

-7-

He holds up his BB air rifle

‘Then CAMERA CUTS BEHIND what is obviously the kitchen

sink of Ralphies house Slowly Ralphies face
appears over the edge The steely eyes survey the
scene before him

EXT BACKYARD - RALPHIES POV - DAY

Looking past the kitchen faucet and out the kitchen
window we see what Ralphie sees At various points
across the backyard desperate men are creeping on
their bellies across the snow toward the house There
are about eightof them and each wears a thin Bandit-

Burglar type black mask the kind that looks like goggles

They all wear striped shirts and carry blackjacks One
nears the house two are slinking over the fence One
crawls through the garage door

MED SHOT RALPHIE

He surveys the situation coolly then fast as a whip-
snake he leaps up and snaps off THREE SHOTS

LONG SHOT - THE YARD

Three bad guys leap acrobatically into the air mortally

wounded The others stand up stricken into dumbness
by the sting of Ol Blue They race unceremoniously
and plunge headlong over the fence and disappear down

the alley We
CUT BACK TO

THE PAMILY

They cheer wildly embracing Ralphie Ralphie stands
tolerating this stoically but kindly

FAMILY

us We were all goners Ralphie
and you saved us

RALPHIE
(manfully)
Me and O1 Blue Of course
there was some that didnt want
me to have Ol Blue

CLOSEUP - THE FAMILY

NARRATOR
They look down in abject
humiliation under my stern
- but kindly reprimand The truth
had smote them

CLOSEUP - RALPHIE

NARRATOR
I turned away after a moment
staring into the danger zone
bravely heroically with just a
trace showing in myeyes of that
distant hurt that was afflicted
upon me by my now contrite
family

Suddenly Ralphie is startled and we hear a voice

BACK TO REALITY

MOTHER (0S)
Ralphie Randy Downstairs in
two minutes

We realize Ralshie has been jarred out of his fantasy
by his mothers voice He leaps up and scurries to get

‘yeady Randy plunges into the drawer and starts to do

his Little Brother thing Two minutes means two
minutes

“2O

NARRATOR
Mothers know nothing about
creeping marauders burrowing
through the snow toward the
kitchen where only you and
you alone stand between your tiny
huddled family and insensate
Evil There was no question
about it Not only should I
have sucha gun -- it was an
absolute necessity Race
memories of Kid plots through
the ages began to surge through
my cortex into conscious
strategy

INT PARENTS BEDROOM — RALPH DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Ralphie into his parents room wheré we
see him pick up a copyof Screen Romances and slip
Boys Life” between the covers

NARRATOR
My mother grabbing for her
copy of ‘Screen Romances’ would
find herself cleverly euchered
into reading a Red Ryder sales
pitch

Nothin -- the classic kid
rejoinder of all time If only
the victims of the Inquisition

off He walks from the bathroom

CAMERA PANS with Ralphie from the bathroom to the
kitchen He and Randy climb up to the table for
breakfast Randy stares at his food Randy never eats

NARRATOR
My fevered brain seethed with
the effort of trying to come
up with the infinitely subtle
devices necessary to implant
the Red Ryder range model air
rifle indelibly into my parents’
consciousness without their
being aware that I had planted
it there

RALPHIE
(abruptly)
Flick says he saw some grizzly
bears near’ Pulaskis candy store
the other day

There is a sudden silence

NARRATOR
My parents looked at me as if I
had lobsters crawling out of my
ears I could tell I was in
imminent danger of overplaying
my hand Casually I switched
tactics

RALPHIE
Ill bet youll never guess
what I got you for Christmas

Dad

FATHER
Hmmm lets see Is it a new
furnace

NARRATOR

My father was one of the most
feared Furnace Fighters in
Northern Indiana People in
Northern Indiana fought winter
tooth and claw bodily and
there was never a let-up Thats
why my little brother knocked
over his milk Indiana wit is
pungent and to the point

NARRATOR
My mother planned these
-tactical retreats whenever my
father was about to go into
combat with the iron dragon
in the basement In the heat
of battle my father wove a
tapestry of obscenity that
as far as we know is still
hanging in the space over Lake
Michigan

The SOUNDS that come hurtling cut of that basement
would cause such loss of face to the producer of a
Japanese monster movie that he would be forced to
impale himself post-haste on the nearest ceremonial
sword ROARS CLANKS SNORTS RATTLES MUMBLES
GROANS SCREAMS Meanwhile Randy and Ralphie start
to put on their overclothes

from a cloud of blue smcke like Mephistopheles appear

For Chrissake stupid I said

He turns and disappears into the blue cloud yelling

We hear the inevitable CRASH as The Old Man hits
bottom again Mother pushes the basement door closed
and turns to the kids The Old Man toils on in the
stygian darkness below the house CAMERA FOLLOWS
Mother as she moves to help Randy with his clothes

NARRATOR
‘Preparing to go to school was
like getting ready for extended
deep-sea diving long johns
corduroy knickers checkered
flannel lumberjack shirt four
sweaters fleece-lined
leatherette sheepskin helmet
goggles mittens with leatherette
gauntlets and a large red star
with an Indian chiefs face in
the middle

Mother has Randy practically on his head trying to
stuff him into his snowsuit Finally she gets him in
and stands him up He stands with both hands extended
from his sides like a tiny scarecrow Mother begins
to wrap an enormous scarf around his neck We hear a
faint whimpering coming from inside Randys suit The
sound is totally muffled Randy stands forlornly with

his arms sticking straight out like an abandoned semaphor

Mother stands back and appraises the situation Sure

forward and forces Randys armg down to his side As
soon as she steps away however they spring back
Randy whimpers Mother steps forward and tries again
Up they spring again

MOTHER
Youll put your arms down when
you get to school

NARRATOR
In Indiana sometimes solutions
are very practical

She proceeds to rewind Randy against his furious protests

NARRATOR
(continuing)

There was no question of staying
home Cold was something that
‘was accepted like air clouds
and parents a fact of nature
and as such could not be used

in any fraudulent scheme to stay
out of school My mother would
simply throw her shoulder against
the front door pushing back the
advancing drifts and stone ice

not a hint of their guilt

awful thing but even worse

A low sullen mumble rolls through the classroom

a Red Ryder BB gun with a
compass in the stock and this
thing that tells time I
think everybody should have a
Red Ryder BB gun They are
very good for Christmas I
dont think a football is a
very good Christmas present

NARRATOR
I was very careful about margins
I knew that when Miss Shields
read my magnificent eloquent
theme that she would sympathize
‘with my plight and make an
appeal on my behalf to the
Powers That Be and everything
would work out Somehow

Ralph completes his work reads over his Magnum Qpus
As he reads we hear swelling in the background the
magnificent melodic lines of Mozarts Andante (Elvira

Mother ushers Miss Shields into the house listens
respectfully as Miss Shields now seated on sofa

speaks

MISS SHIELDS

(continuing)
I understand you have expressed
doubts about Ralph your
extraordinary son as to
whether or not he should be
the owner of a Red Ryder BB
gun He has convinced me
beyond a doubt through his
magnificent and eloquent
theme that it is absolutely
necessary that Ralph be given
a Red Ryder BB gun for the
protection of your family
Ordinarily I would not make
such a recommendation but
in the case of Ralph I feel
certain that he will use his
Red Ryder BB gun with his
customary skill and responsibility
If you have any questions
about what I have just said
please write them in a theme
of one hundred words or less
for Ralph to deliver to me at
school I will grade it and
return it by next Friday

“MOTHER
Thank you Miss Shields we
will follow your instructions

his golden bullwhip in the air viciously Behind him
we see the woven basket of a curiously futuristic

a battered hinge-sprung

sagging hillbilly shack

RALPHIES POV - LONG SHOT - THE BUMPUS HOUSE

The house is surrounded by a thick swamp of junk old
truck tires rusty pitchforks busted chicken crates
an old bathtub at least 57 ancient bedsprings eight
oer nine horse collars chicken wire baling wire
barbed wire corncobs an ironing board and a lot of
big tall water boilers with pipes sticking out The
Old Man is trying to get out of the car —

NARRATOR
And then there were the dogs
they had at least seven
hundred and forty-five dogs
Now our neighborhood had
always had dogs walking around
ordinary dogs with names like
Zero or Prince The Bumpus
Ww hounds on the other hand
” were just a great churning
mass of tails and tongues
and flea-bitten bodies You
could almost see the smell -
and they loved my father
They ignored every other
human being on earth but my
Old Man Every time he set
foot outside the whole tidal
wave of heaving flanks and
bloodshot eyes would descend
on him The trouble was that
half of them were trying to
lick his face and the other
half were trying to take off
his leg

The Old Man is fighting for his life and screaming —
at the top of his lungs We cant quite make out what
hes saying but it sounds like

many mistakes are in this
Picture all offering fifty

For the cost of a twocent

struggled nightly to hit the

Paste pot handy scissors and
‘ruler pen and ink at the ready
The Old Man clipped and glued
struggled and guessed - and
now the payoff had come

feet high

behind his Harold Lloyd glasses
He was almost overcome by art

quick whiff of ozone and the

lamp blazed forth in unparalleled
glory From ankle to thigh the
translucent flesh radiated a
vibrant sensual luminous
orangepinkish nimbus of pagan
fire All it needed was tom-
toms and Maybe a bone or two

The Old Man backs away in admiration The leg lamp

is ridiculous But The Old Man is in his glory

I had done it There could
be no doubt that this theme
would absolutely overwhelm
Miss Shields Not only was
the Red Ryder 200shot
carbine air rifle irrevocably
mine but I began to envisage
that Miss Shields in her
ecstasy would excuse me from
theme writing for the rest of
my school days or at least until
high school such was the
clarity and power of my prose that
it seemed ridiculous to ask
me to demonstrate it further

We see Miss Shields grading papers grumpily She throws one
one down in disgust and scribbles a large F on it She
picks up another and gives it the same treatment and another
and yet another She puts her hand to her forehead in despair
for’a moment then she plunges in again

She begins reading Ralphie’s theme Her face brightens Her
mouth flies open She reads on She utters an exclamation
of joy and clasps the theme to her bosom silent movie style

She begins reading again barely able to contain herself

With every sentence she exclaims in ecstasy Finally she
can contain herself no more She leaps to her feet throwing
the theme into the air and races to the blackboard She
writes Ralphie’s name on the board in huge letters and follows
this with

RALPHIE Bebe tet bt ete

A huge A then she begins writing plusses after the A She
writes plusses until she runs out of board then continues
writing themoff the board and around the walls

standing modestly acknowledging the thunderous ovation of his
adoring classmates We HOLD on this for a long moment then

Ralph and the others ignore him moving in a sort of

‘purposeless ramble slowly working their way home
kicking at cans Schwartz hurls a rock languidly

at a telephone pole insulator not even bothering to
turn and see if it hits Obviously they do this
every day

They are passing before a wooden fence The old
familiar MUSIC creeps up very faintly Ralph drags
a stick across the pickets making a rasping sound

CAMERA PANS DOWN the fence We see the familiar
brogans matching Ralphies stride-for-stride The
boys are oblivious to the menace Such unwariness
does not go unpunished in the jungles of boyhood

CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH from the boys to the presence

stalking them on the other side of the fence

Their aimless wanderings take them into an alley

at the end of which is a fence they must scale to
continue on their way As they near the cul-de-sac
the MUSIC RISES At the last minute Ralphie senses
something He stops and looks in the direction of
the fence

RALPHIE

between two boards It is a malevolent face It is
the face of meanness personified It is the dreaded
GROVER DILL The MUSIC SHUDDERS appropriately

NARRATOR
Grover Dill What a rotten
name We were trapped
There he stood between us and
the alley Grover Dill staring
out at us with his yellow eyes
He had yellow eyes So help me
God yellow eyes His cap slunk
low over his non-existent brow
resting on his ears which
flared out like toadstools His
lips curled over his green teeth
in a semblance of speech

DILL
Hey Fat mess

I turned in a blind primal
panic and started for the
fence at the end of the
alley No hope There
curling up like a venomous
Cheshire cat was Dills
fierce little toady Scut

of bully His nose was always
running even when it wasnt
I did not know one kid who was
not afraid of Dill because
Dill was truly aggressive
This kind of aggression later in
life is often called Talent or
Drive but to the great formless
herd of kids it just meant a lot
of running getting belted and
continually being ashamed

I have since heard of people

It was not easy to disbelieve
fully in Santa Claus because
there wasnt much else to

a suspended squadron of plastic angels blowing silver

winding red chute which gives the kid a little ride
down to floor level and back intro oblivion fer another

as it bobs on Santas lap what seems miles above the
floor We hear a thin high trailing wail Suddenly

BACK TO SCENE

Snow White grabs his elbow with an iron claw and Ralph
begins to struggle upward toward the mountaintop

NARRATOR
I have always felt that later
generations of tots products of
less romantic upbringing cynical
non-believers in Santa Claus from
birth can never know the nature
of the true dream I was well
into my twenties before I finally
gave up on the Easter Bunny and
I am not convinced that I am the
richer for it I had long before
decided to levei with Santa to
really lay it on the line No
kid stuff If I was going to
ride the range with Red Ryder
Santa Claus was going to have to
get the straight poop

This Santa Claus is not the conventional department store
Santa but rather Santa as he is seen thuugh a childs
eyes He is ENORMOUS seemingly eight feet tall high
shiny black patent-leather boots a nimbus of snow white
beard and a real thrumming belt-creéaking stomach His
voice is amplified to a thundering pitch He seems vast
immense enormous worldfilling God like to the eyes

know how it must feel The

reeled with the realization
that maybe Santa did know
how rotten I had been and
that the football was not
only a threat but a punish-
ment I could see that
either my father or Santa
or perhaps both were not
content to let bygones be

We see Mother and the ld Man as they play Santa Claus
The Old Man opens the front door and goes to the trunk

Several of the Bumpuses hounds stir A howl sets up
The old man dashes for the door slipping and sliding
on the new snow He makes the front door one step
ahead of the furry mass

INT HOUSE DAY 73

We see Ralphie and Randy creeping down the stairs
They stop and stare into the living room

CAMERA PULLS BACK to find great heaps of tissuey crinkley
sparkly enigmatic packages under the tree half-hidden
amid the folds of a white bedsheet that looks in the

soft light like some magic snowbank

Ralph and Randy stare in awe at the tree and the packages
beneath it

NARRATOR
Santa Claus had come My
brother circled around the tree
moaning softly while I --
cooler and more controlled --
quickly eyed the mountain of
revealingly wrapped largess
And knew the worst

Mother and the Old Man enter behind them They sit down
and watch the kids reaction to the presents

NARRATOR
(continuing)
Christmas had officially begun
We plunged into the cornucopia
quivering with desire and the
ecstasy cf unbridled avarice

In the background on the RADIO Lionel Barrymores
wheezy friendly old voice speaks kindly of Bob Cratchit
and Tiny Tim and the Ghost of Old Marley Ralph grabs

a package It is tagged To Randy From Santa

Ralph feverishly passes it aver to Randy and returns to
work He pulls out a largish lumpy redwrapped gift
We see the tag reads To Ralphie from Aunt Clara

Frantically Ralph tears the wrappings off It is a

pair of slippers Bunny slippers Ralphs mouth drops
open

Ralph looks

NARRATOR
(continuing)

Oh no A pair of fuzzy pink
idiotic crosseyed lop-eared
bunny slippers Aunt Clara had

for years labored under the
delusion that I was not only

perpetually four years old but

also a girl

MOTHER
(adding oil to the
flames)
Oh arent they sweet

disgusted

MOTHER
(continuing)
Aunt Clara always gives you
the nicest presents Put
them on see if they fit

Ralpk puts on slippers

NARRATOR
Immediately my feet began to
sweat as those two fluffy
little bunnies with the blue
button eyes stared sappily
up at meand J knew that
for at least two years I

would have to wear them every

time Aunt Clara visited us
I just hoped that Flick would

‘never spot them as the word

of this huthiliation could
easily make life at Warren G
Harding School a veritable
hell

Next to Ralph Randy silently doggedly strips package
after package until he hits the zeppelin

RANDY

Randy launches it upward into the middle branches of

to the floor and a string of lights winks out

RANDY

Ahhhh What good is a zeppelin
that dont fly

RALPHIE
It rolls And beeps

Randy on his knees begins pushing zeppelin beeping
fiendlishly propellors clacking madly across the
living room rug

NARRATOR
It was a sound that was to
become sickeningly familiar

Randy continues to play with zeppelin Ralph opens
more packages A Sandy Andy a dump truck a Monopoly
game etc

NARRATOR
(continuing)
My brothers gift to me was the
only bright spot in an otherwise
remarkably mediccre haul a
rubber Frankenstein face

Ralph immediately puts on Frankenstein face

Finally it is all over’ There are no more mysterious
packages under the tree only a great pile of crumpled
tissue paper string and empty boxes Randy lies
dozing amid the rubble the zeppelin clasped in one
hand and his new fire truck in the other

NARRATOR

There was no denying that I
had scored heavily with the

Simoniz and the fly swatter
as well as the zeppelin The
joy of giving can uplift the
saddened heart But then it
came I must admit I had
been completely taken in

Father leans forward in his easy chair his eighth glass
of wine in his hand He gets up ceremoniously and moves
over to the tree

FATHER
Say

(he pauses dramatieally)
Dont I see something over
there stuck behind the drapes
Why I think there is something
over there behind the drapes

Ralph looks up afraid to believe He runs to drapes
and pulls them out Sure enough there it is a long
heavy red-wrapped package It is marked To Ralphie
From Santa Frantically Ralph tears the wrappings —
off

NARRATOR
A Red Ryder carbine-action
range-model BB gun

Ralph makes inarticulate gasps of surprise and egstasy

NARRATOR

and taut its dark polished
stock gleaming like all the

the glasses were another

such swift and terrible retri-
bution on a kid as the pair of

Ill fake it Thevll never

know the lens is gone But
then gingerly fingering my

rapidly swelling black eye I

realized that here was a shiner
on the way that would top even
the one I got from Grover Dill

Now it is well known through-
out the midwest that the old
man is a turkey junkie A
bonafide galli turkecanus freak -

his eyes would begin to gleam
with a wild and ravenous light
Every few hours he would check
his carving set to make sure

tines sharp

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 78

We see the old man peering in horror over his newspaper
After a beat we see what the tragedy is A blur

streaks by the foreground of our shot The old man
stares Then another blur whizzes by Then another and
we realize we are seeing the Bumpuses hound Now the
whole pack roars past The old man scrambles to his

feet

OLD MAN
Holy Christ the turkey
The turkey Those goddamned
dogs The turkey

He races for the kitchen just in time to see the dogs
leap upon the table grab the twelve pound turkey and
in a-mass of snarling fury disappear through the

kitchen door all but taking it off the hinges

Ralphie Randy and Mother arrive just in time to see the
Old Man staring out the door as the sound of the hounds
recedes in the distance

Finally the old Man turns and walks back into the kitchen
He stands looking downat the big sheet of wax paper
dripping with warm turkey gravy and big clumps of oyster
stuffing

NARRATOR
The heavenly aroma still hung
heavy in the house But it
was gone - all gone -- no
turkey - no turkey sandwiches
no turkey salad no turkey
gravy turkey hash turkey
ala king or gallons of
turkey soup gone all gone
The 61d Man came as close to
erying as Id ever seen him
come

The Old Man stands there quivering with frustration
Finally

We are across the street looking in at the family They
are the only customers The happy Chinese family hover
around them ‘two waiters come marching out with a wilted

‘potted palm dotted with a sad string of colored lights

They are followed by a waiter carrying a tray bearing a
large duck The tray is placed before the family We
hear an exchange then the Old Man begins to bheam the

in the glow of the wine andthe moment Mother stops
and looks down at the Old Man For these brief moments
all is right with the world

They look at one another with a oneness of satisfaction
that comes rarely to any of us It is a nice moment
simple uncontrived and affecting Mother sits beside
the Old Man and their hands entwine and they share no
