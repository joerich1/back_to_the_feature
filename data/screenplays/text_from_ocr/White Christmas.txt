MARTHA
He says older men have been called
and besides he misses the food I
tell you Susan he tried to make it
a casual letter with little jokes
but it came out just begging

Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see

the
figure of a man in overalls bending over an
incinerator
shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow
His back is to CAMERA

BETTY

(Phil and Judy enter

from the kitchen)
Frankly this couldnt come at a
better time They want me to come
back to The Carousel again - I used
to sing there before Judy and I teamed
up - and I had to turn it down because
they can only use a single

Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage

GENERAL
(Shouting over noise
of train)
Where are you going to be

BETTY
The Carousel

The General looks at her questioningly
BETTY
(Whispering during a
lull in the noise)

I sent them a telegram this morning

The General smiles Betty waves a farewell to him and

crosses

to the train starting up the steps The notion behind
this

scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue
due

to the whistle bells and escaping steam The manner
of

playing though indicates the sentiment To emphasize
it

Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes and Betty
fully

realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not
return

consciously her affection We hear Betty

BETTY
Take care of my little sister

BOB
She can take care of herself Worry
about the menfolk Now dont forget
to write

WAVERLY

(He must have had a

blood transfusion

from a sergeant at

I am not satisfied with the conduct
of this division Some of you men
are under the impression that having
been at Anzio entitles you not to
wear neckties You are wrong
Neckties will be worn in this area
I have also noticed a deterioration
in the quality of saluting This is
to be improved I have also had
complaints from the commanding officer
of the rest area in Naples He
informs me that the non-fraternization
rule is constantly being broken by
men of this division In fact this
division is outstanding in its
violations of non-fraternization
You all know the rules The non-
fraternization ban expressly declares
you are not to talk to women

(A slightly different

tone)
Dont talk to them That is all

They howl and cheer He makes has way toward his own
table
greeting old friends on the way
