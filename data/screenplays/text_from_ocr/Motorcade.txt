EXT CAFE - ACROSS THE STREET — GENEVA -— DAY

CARL DURST watches the destruction with faint regret Hes
45 American by birth a quiet businessman He hears

MAN AT NEXT TABLE Know whats going there next

The man one table over is ROBERT DERMEER 50 charming but
soulless immaculately dressed Durst turns eyes him

DERMEER (MAN AT NEXT TABLE)
Headquarters of a German cell-phone
company

DerMeer chuckles Durst smiles thinly not engaging

DERMEER (CONTD)
I see you paid your check in dollars
Good strategy dumping them I dont
know if I mentioned it in my e-mail
but even supermodels are insisting on
being paid in Euros now

DURST
You did But all currencies
fluctuate

DERMEER

The dollar isnt fluctuating it’s
sinking - because theres nothing
behind it anymore Just an empire in
twilight In fact theres only one
American institution left with any
luster to it at all

He nods at Dursts International Herald Tribune a photo of
US PRESIDENT ED LINDEN Durst gets the point

Then DerMeer flips the paper over revealing its headline
Linden Insists US Economy Sound as Banks Fail He looks
to Durst who doesnt react

DERMEER (CONTD)
Sad really watching a Superpower
turn into a debtor nation

Fb Oe

DURST
Did you really fly me all this way
just to read me a headline

DERMEER
I flew you here - that is the
countries I represent flew you here —-
to sway you

DURST
Well you havent

With that Durst rises and leaves - no goodbye DerMeer is
stunned but too vain to show it He sighs stirs his tea

Then in a flash Durst re-appears behind DerMeer and slams
him face-first into the table That fast DerMeer is a mess

Now Durst starts pounding the guy in broad daylight utterly

indifferent to the STUNNED BYSTANDERS around him DerMeer
sags to the ground absorbing one shot after another as

DURST (CONTD)
(mid-assault)
And I will not have my countrys
name besmirched by some Swiss
faggot in an Italian suit I have
fought and bled for that country
What have you ever bled for

Then he stops DerMeers face is a pulpy mess Bones have
broken The stunned BYSTANDERS just stare slack-jawed Durst
catches his breath and leans in close enough to whisper

DURST (CONTD)
Have I swayed you

(DerMeer cant respond)
Good Because for what you want
twenty million is an insult The
price is two-hundred million

(a beat)

And thats in dollars

He walks away DerMeer struggles to breathe The street is
peaceful again save for the jack-hammering We CUT TO

into the liquid wetting the face of it then turns the ring
around (so the jewels are facing his palm)

A cage sits nearby Inside is a dog a BLOODHOUND Bragg
opens the cage as Wilkie summons the dog with a sound

The Bloodhound obeys Wilkie kneels down and gently pets the
animal that class ring grazing the dogs flank

Then Wilkie steps back And they all watch

Silence until the Bloodhound begins to stagger suddenly
unable to right itself Soon the animal stumbles to the

Lets have a look at that Honda

LEEDS
Hey I dont wanna have an issue

DREW
Ten years from now you wont say
things like that anymore playing
out the string” lost something off
his fastball Because youll realize
how ridiculous they make you sound

Leeds wasnt expecting that so hes silent

DREW (CONTD)

reasons You could wind up on the
sidelines - yeah even you - just for
having an opinion And you could wind
up staying there And then youll
realize something else

Alvero Marguez just spent twenty
years in a Venezuelan prison - and
the only thing anyones ever been
able to convict him of was his belief
in American Democracy Now I have a
chance to greet him one leader to
another That kind of symbolism
matters So no we wont be

our own streets or cant we

would be which radio frequencies to
block which limo hed be put in if
everything broke down - things only

even some despair Durst enjoyed that

DURST (CONTD)
My Goodness that look of guilt Did
you do something to that boy

You did didnt you What was it

Lindens eyes look murderous

DURST (CONTD)
Might as well tell me youve hinted
around at it already And it‘s the
only eulogy hes likely to get

Linden continues to resist Durst doesnt seem to mind

DURST (CONTD)
Fine Force me to guess He was part
of your detail and

LINDEN
Head of my detail When I was Vice
President

DURST
Oh Better

Linden is reeling hating himself

LINDEN
I was doing something stupid
something likely to blow up my career
- and my marriage And he suggested
that I stop it So

DURST
So you make him walk the plank of
course Sounds just like the
government Tve grown to know and
hate Now tell me again about all the
virtues those two-hundred year-old
buildings are supposed to stand for

He pulls that FLARE GUN from his pocket and squeezes off a
single shot - straight into the air

Instantly hes tackled by Durst Bragg and all four THUGS

Then the truck ahead of him brakes forcing Drew to swerve

points it in the wrong direction heading back toward the on-
