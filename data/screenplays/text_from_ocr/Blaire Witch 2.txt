Music begins to be heard under it--uber Goth Type O Negatives
Haunted It suddenly swells--to ear-shatter proportions

SMASH UP ON
EXT A VAN - IN MOTION - HIGHWAY - DAY

Zipping fast down US Route 70--West We see the mileage signs on
both sides of the median indicating where theyre coming from and
where theyre now going from Baltimore towards Frederick
Maryland (NOTE this is shot on 16 or 35mm film which will be the
medium of reality for the rest of the movie)

The music thats blaring isnt underscoring--its coming from
inside the Van As is a WOMANS VOICE (ANNA) shouting over it

ANNA (0OS)
You want to turn that shit down
just a hair

Visual pandemonium as the Camcorder goes flying from his hands and
down next to the

BRAKE PEDAL

We see both of COTTERS FEET smash down on the pedal Hear 0OS
screeching of the passengers--screeching of the brake shoes--
screaming of the tires as the Van swerves into the next lane--and
then an angry symphony of CAR HORNS

Either way maybe theres a book
in it and they both make a ton of
money

shoulders and lower backs while sightseeing the remnants of the
old house and its environs

Cotter not surprisingly is taping everything

a huge bite taken out of one of the walls of the foundation stone
brick and soil strewn everywhere around it
COTTER (OS)
Where they found the backpacks and

Buried deep under 200 years worth
of soil ash and compost layers

Ancient runes--

COTTER (OS)
--what the fucks a rune--

CUT BACK TO - FILM
Nick erasing half the marks with one sweep of his palm

stretching everywhere above them

COTTER
Oak

ANNA
No Whats it doing here in the
middle of the foundation

HEATHER
Growing This place burnt down 50
years ago Trees happen

branches

Nick flips through a voluminous loose-leaf notebook--points out a

page to Anna

NICK
Look its right here--from the Blair
Witch Dossier--the sketch the
anthropology students made of their
dig when they found the backpack

The sketch shows a spindly growth in the middle of the
no more than six feet high

ANNA
Thats a sapling--this mothers

Its a sketch Anna--its not to-
scale cartography the tree was not

--do you agree its that old Nick

NICK
Okay fine whatever yes--its an
old tree

HEATHER

ANNA
Because it means the tree is older
than the house

COTTER

ANNA
So whoever built this--

through the loose-leaf--

NICK
--brother of Rustin Parrs maternal
grandfather somewhere after 1858--

ANNA
--whoever--they built an entire
house around a tree Sticking
up right through the living room

me

NICK
The rest of the family was
crazy as Rusty Parr

men off the ground

Finishes the last of Cotters beer and discards the empty

minds and the greatest stress
reliever in creation right at
their fingertips Nada

COTTER

No sense at all
(beat)

Im a little stressed

HEATHER
Try a long walk

INT NICK AND ANNAS TENT - SIMULTANEOUS
It aint the Ritz but they did come prepared air mattresses big

Coleman lanterns a kerosene heater--and heaps of books and
brimming file folders

Theyre sitting up in their respective mummy-style sleeping bags
studying documents making notes--

--when this high-pitched MOANING can be heard outside the tent

Nick and Anna looks at each other Nick grabs one of the lanterns
and dashes for the tent door

EXT THE TENT - CONTINUOUS

He shines the light slowly out into the foundation ruins--
--and theres Domini still lying on her back staring up cooing

DOMINI
Oooh Oooh

NICK
Ah Domini

DOMINT
What

NICK
You planning on sleeping out there

DOMINI
Not planning on sleeping at all

She points up into the big oak in the middle of the foundation

DOMINI
Oooh Oooh

The call comes back to her from the tree oooh-oooh

Nick sees perched high up on one of the branches A GREAT HORNED
OWL Its staring down at them

DOMINI
I figure I lie here long enough
maybe hell swoop down and carry
me off in his talons
Nick rolls his eyes and goes back into his tent
COTTER AND HEATHER

are also watching this from their tent

HEATHER
We should be so lucky

COTTER
Butt-ugly owl

They duck back into the tent
The Owl keeps watching
FADE TO BLACK

Several beats And then in the darkness a rustling sound is heard
A whisper that sounds like

VOICE
see if its alive--

CLICK Then Annas hand seen--shes just turned on one of the
lanterns Sits up in her sleeping bag Listens The sounds have
stopped

Beat She gets out of her bag grabs the lantern and goes to the
tent flap--

EXT TENT - CONTINUOUS
--and just as she steps outside--
--something strikes her hand--

ANNA
--shit--

--the lantern goes flying into the dirt--

--and suddenly out of the darkness come flying--

LITTLE HANDS

wielding small sharpened sticks--or are they tent pegs--

--and they stab into Annas belly again and again accompanied by
shrieks of delight

Anna screams--

NICK (VO)
Whos James

ANNA TURNS
and finds shes inside the tent wrapped tight in her sleeping bag
Staring at Nick whos propped up on his air mattress with a book
and a lantern staring quizzically back at her
ANNA
(disoriented)

NICK

ANNA

She pulls her sleeping bag down looks at her belly--unmarked
unharmed bloodless

Nick turns Annas at the tent door holding a pile of empty file
folders and two looseleaf notebooks that have somehow been torn
clean in half Now Nicks incensed

NICK
Thats almost a years worth of
work
(into the woods)
Scumbags Oh Jesus Jesus

DOMINI

COTTER
One set Everything from midnight

DOMINI

--no I think theyre all in there

Shes pointing to the collapsed section of the basement foundation
where the original Blair Witch Project Tapes were found

The other four stop and stare at her
And then Cotter goes diving in the hole Beat

COTTER (OS)
Sonovabitch

And emerges with two grimy handfuls of VHS Beta and 8mm video
tapes

HEATHER
Those ours

Cotter brushes dirt from them holds them up for inspection

COTTER
My handwriting on the face
labels
And then his excitement switches to confusion Turns to Domini

COTTER

DOMINI

COTTER

My ass--you saw those four
fucking baboons put ‘em there

DOMINT

trouble of stealing the camera
and all this other stuff and leave

COTTER

NICK

and homeless and averaging at
least one homicide a week

INT COTTERS BUILDING - JUST AFTER

Four of the five of them ride nervously in a huge ancient elevator
that ascends in a series of jerks Cotters oblivious

COTTER
Used to be a meat-packing plant
Slaughter on the ground floor--
carcasses schlepped up on this
thing for dissection and grinding
and--

HEATHER
--Cotter shut up

COTTER
What

INT DOOR TO COTTERS LOFT - JUST AFTER

Cotter opens the elevator grates revealing a metal door with a
single lock He fits a key into it

NICK
Just one lock in this neighbor-
hood

COTTER
All I need--

--throws the door wide--

--the LOUD BARKING of what sounds like a pack of pit-bulls greets
them

COTTER
Get inside quick theyll stop

HEATHER
Too busy eating us

COTTER
Just go

INT COTTERS LOFT - CONTINUOUS

He shuts the door the BARKING stops Everyones eyes zapping all
360 degrees around them no dogs

Cotter taps a small speaker above the door

COTTER
Baltimores cheapest burglar alarm

He re-opens the door a crack--the BARKING starts anew Closes it
Nothing

COTTER

Had the door jimmied a few times

Nobodys yet made it inside
He ushers them into a huge
DOUBLE-STORIED SPACE
easily 30 feet high Exposed brick walls--massive iron roof beams
And crammed to bursting with bizarre esoterica everywhere
--carousel horses huge airplane propellers a bowsprit from an
old clipper ship lawn jockeys a set of bunkbeds made entirely of

wagon wheel parts bowling balls cannonballs pinball machines

ANNA
Looks like business is booming

COTTER
Theres some stuff thats hard to
part with Editings stuffs up
there--

--he points to a loft overhanging the big room--a thin wooden
railing separating the work space from a sheer 20 foot drop

COTTER
--stairs are back through the
kitchen--and a ton of bedrooms
you wanna dump your stuff or
catch a nap--

INT COTTERS LOFT WORK SPACE - A WHILE LATER - DUSK

Cotters running tape through his new video iMac The rest of them
are gathered around the screen in various degrees of discomfort

They look like theyve been there for some time A lot of yawns
Nicks rubbing his temples like somebodys pounding a marimba
inside his head

ON SCREEN theyre all watching minute after minute of nothing
Darkness The outlines of the Parr Foundation Trees in the back-
ground Silence

Several beats as they continue to watch this stasis Then

NICK
I think we get the gist

ANNA
Weve looked at half of one
tape
COTTER
Theres four other angles man

NICK
--great we can watch Domini

chance

NICK

lack of evidence Maybe on the
ride home we can figure how the

with no thesis

ANNA
Im not going anywhere til--

through the iMac

Shes playing and replaying a short section of Cotters camcorder
tape where the bunch of them were interacting with the Stoner Film
Crew

She keeps seeing a FLASH on the tape Between two trees far in the
background But she cant seem to freeze the image inside the
flash It looks vaguely like a MIDDLE-AGED MAN

HEATHER
Does this look like a person

She turns Sitting on the couch where Domini was is now the very
clear presence of

A MIDDLE-AGED MAN

And then she starts running

INT COTTERS ELEVATOR - JUST AFTER - DAY

ANNA

INT KITCHEN - LATER - AFTERNOON

Heather sits at the table alone staring at the 8x10 that Cotter
made for Domini

HEATHER
What did you see here that I
cant see damnit

She runs a finger down the length of the blur in the branches

HEATHER
What is it that scared you
so much

Nick enters heads for the blotched 60s vintage Mr Coffee maker

NICK
Finally got her back to sleep

HEATHER
Nick what you should do is get
her back up and get her to a
goddamn doctor

NICK
Jesus you dont think I know

NICK

Yeah I know Itsalright Were

HEATHER
--a lot

NICK
Heather

HEATHER

NICK

Okay Hypothetically

HEATHER

NICK
You thinkthere couldve been
something up in those woods that
Anna--

HEATHER
--its not a couldve--there was
Nick And it fucked up Anna and
did something to Domini and it
caused my father to die and its
here with us in this place now
And I dont have one single idea
in hell whats going to happen
next just that its going to
happen to one of us And then
the other And then the other
Its going to get into our brains

And Heather finally loses it and starts weeping--great wracking
sobs Nicks a little awkward at first how to comfort her Finally
just starts lightly massaging her neck

NICK
Theres explanations Rational
explanations for everything thats
happened Well drive ourselves
crazy if we keep obsessing on
supernatural what-ifs

HEATHER
That feels good Lower--down
into my neck

Nick moves his hands down--

--and somehow the two of them are then guiding his hands down into
her blouse onto her breasts--

--and shes moaning and grabbing hard onto his hair--

--and pulling his whole head down to hers And their lips and
tongues meet and theyre biting each other like animals--

--and his hands are yanking and twisting hard on her breasts
between her legs--—

--and shes literally clawing him with her fingernails drawing
blood down the length of his chest--

--until she reaches a burgundy-colored mark right at his belt line
with tendrils like fingers--

--SNAP--its like someone woke them from a dream They both look
at each other baffled--what the hell just happened But it wasnt
a dream Nicks chest is streaming blood theres blood on
Heathers lips--

--matching the color of the mark on Nicks waist and the one
Heather now sees inside her elbow

They both move away from each other uncomprehending--and scared
INT NICK AND ANNAS BEDROOM - DUSK
Nick pacing the floor as Anna lies in bed

NICK
I dont know what it is but there

INT COTTERS WORK LOFT - NIGHT

Cotters behind the iMac screening tape millimeter by millimeter
downing one Coke after another Hes so caffed-out both his body
and his voice is shaking

COTTER
This could be something right
here do you think its some-
thing Heather--

Heather doesnt even look up Shes just sitting on the broken-
backed couch staring at Dominis 8x10

COTTER
--but that could be just a shadow
I think its a shadow its nothing
Heather do you think its nothing--

--and he just keeps prattling on oblivious eyes fixed on the tape
moving at a snails pace in front of him

HEATHER
Its about the tree its
something about the tree

She puts it down on a cushion and snatches up the dog-eared copy of
the Blair Witch Dossier Easily flips to the page Domini showed
her Elly Kedward trussed in the wagon in the woods

Flips backwards in the book looking for something--
HEATHER
--the goddamn tree Domini
for chrissake what
--and then she stops on the page that shows the anthropology
students sketch of the Parr foundation the skinny little sapling
in the middle--
--then back to the woodcut of Elly Kedward in the woods--
--then back to Dominis photo of the foundation--the huge tree--
HEATHER
Same trees They took Elly Kedward

out to the same kind of trees

COTTER
(still oblivious)
--I look and look in the tree
I ever see hes always there watching
that stupid owl over and over--

HEATHER

--Cotter where can I get on-line

COTTER

--anywhere anywhere all up and live

all the time--fucking owl--

pieces that dont fit together

HEATHER
Where

COTTER
Down there in the Park

Heather looks up Cotter is looking down through the big rooms
huge windows hes waving to someone

Heather gets up Slowly peers over the loft railing Squints
HEATHERS POV

A stark-naked Domini is standing in Druid Hill Park Looking up at
them

EXT DRUID HILL PARK - JUST AFTER - NIGHT
Heather and Cotters pace slows drastically as they try and
navigate the overgrown pathways inside the Park The flora is dense

below and above--moonlight barely penetrates where theyre walking

HEATHER
Domini

Cotter puts a finger to her lip Whispers

COTTER
Not the place you want to
announce your arrival

HEATHER
Hows she going to know where
to--
COTTER
--things got a way of finding
you here
They walk
HEATHER

Its freezing

COTTER
Next time try putting on shoes--

--the two of them stop dead in their tracks Through the thicket
ahead of them they can see a clearing Illuminated by the moon is
what appears to be an old

WOODEN OX CART

with SNOW drifted up nearly to the hubs of its wheels

HEATHER AND COTTER

are suddenly so cold they can see their breath in the air

HEATHER
What the fuck--

COTTER
--I dont know

He grabs her hand and pulls her through the thicket They enter
THE CLEARING

the snow is now gone Where the cart was is now just a stack of
rotting cut brush A clean-up effort someone must have started
then abandoned Heather and Cotter stare at each other baffled--
and not a little afraid

COTTER
The moon trying to shoot down
through all these trees--can make
things funky--

HEATHER
--I saw what I saw

COTTER
Yeah Me too

HEATHER
The cart they brought Elly Kedward
into the woods with--

COTTER
--into the Black Hills with--200-
something miles from here--

HEATHER
--Domini

They both see it at the same time
A NAKED WHITE BODY

face down at the base of a tree Heather races over kneels down
next to it

HEATHER
Oh Jesus what happened are
you--

--and Heather lets out a screech The face of the body reveals an
ELDERLY MALE Filthy tongue lolling black out of its mouth Hes

been dead for some time

COTTER (OS)
Be it still alive James

HEATHER
What--

Heather turns--
A PACK OF LITTLE BOYS
wild-eyed and wielding sticks RUSH AT HEATHER--

BOY 1
--then finish the job lads

--Heather screeches again throws up her arms to protect herself--

COTTER (OS)
Jesus

Heather looks up Cotters lying on the ground holding his
bleeding forehead

COTTER
What the fuck you do at for

Heather looks at her hand Shes clenching a sharp stick in it
The Little Boys are gone The body of the Dead Man is not

HEATHER
I didnt
She grabs his hand pulls him up They start running

INT

Heather and Cotter at the table

COTTERS KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

as they tell Nick what happened

HEATHER
--and one of the little boys
his name was James As in the
boy James Kurth--the first child
to disappear from the town of
Blair after they banished Elly
Kedward

A look of alarm comes to Nicks face But he says nothing

HEATHER
What

NICK
I dunno its anything Its a
name Annas mentioned--from her
dreams

COTTER
I cant handle this anymore

He produces a large thick spliff and torches it up Big hit
passes it to Heather who takes an even bigger one

NICK
How much of that stuff you guys
been smoking

COTTER
Enough to keep sane

NICK
Enough to make shapes and shadows
in the dark into something else

HEATHER
Spare me

NICK
Hey chemicals fear sleep-
deprivation--and a round-the-clock
obsession with the occult--hellve
a recipe for a mind-fuck

COTTER
Except we seem about 18 times
more together than you

Heather spit-takes a lung-full of smoke

still out of breath and shaking

and
COTTER
Id strongly advise you to join
us--

HEATHER
--before you lose your emotional
lunch

NICK

(shrugging)
Yeah what the hell

He takes the joint sucks in mightily--

HEATHER
Atta boy--

--and then the whole kitchen seems to explode--

--GLASS and MULLIONS from the big window in the room come hurtling
in shards at them--

--and then when the noise finally stops and the flying debris has
all hit the floor they all look down and see

ON THE PEELING LINOLEUM
A HORNED OWL

broken and bleeding from its header through the window Spasming
and then dying Eyes wide staring up at them

No one says a word They just look at it
INT COTTERS WORK-LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

A lot of chairs but nobodys sitting down Cotter Heather and
Nick all look like their nerves are fraying down to bare wire

HEATHER
We are being fucked with here
someone or something

NICK
Domini

HEATHER
Why in the world would she--

NICK
--why in the world would she just fly
the coop in the first place

COTTER
Chrissake why any of this

NICK
I think its time to get out
of here

HEATHER
Nobodys going anywhere--

COTTER
--hell I dont think Im ever
leaving this place again--

HEATHER
--one of us all of us--I have
no idea--brought whatever this
thing is back here Were not
going to go out there and spread
it around like Typhoid Mary Were
gonna figure it out were gonna
bring a goddamn end to it

NICK
Dominis the only logical
explanation

HEATHER
Were not dealing with fucking
logic here

COTTER
Its Domini its not Domini I
dont care--all I know is Im not
dealing with something--anything--
snuffing me in my sleep I want to
do what we did in the woods--
surveillance of this whole place
247 with somebody monitoring
those cameras every second Theres
something somebody here I want to
see em coming

NICK
I thought all your equipment got
stolen

COTTER

All the shit that was worth anything
yes Youd be amazed though what you
can get free on the net

He opens a desk drawer--there must be a dozen little palm
corders in there

INT THE LOFT - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT
What Cotter lacks in other equipment he makes up for with cable

huge SPOOLS of it--and hes running it from the various tiny vid-
cams to a motley bank of monitors hes set up on the kitchen table
HEATHER

duct-tapes one of the little units on the top of a closet door-
frame in the hallway

COTTER
sees he has an excellent angle on the front doorelevator
ANNA

watches half asleep and befuddled in their bedroom as Nick aims a
camera on a jerry-rigged broom-handle tripod

COTTER

connects the cables in the kitchen--sees Anna and a clear view of
the bedroom door

NICK and HEATHER

collaborate on installing a camera from Cotters work-loft that
provides a view of the dark area under the work-loft Nick lowers
the camera on a rope while Heather guides and supports the cables
attached

COTTER

watches the camera descend on one of the monitors Satisfied by the
view its giving him he yells

COTTER
Thats good Tie it off

BACK IN THE WORK-LOFT

Nick does so Ties the rope securely around the loft railing Ties
a slip knot in the loose end and lassoes it over one of the iron
beams above to keep it from being a hazard He has to jump to catch
the rope as it comes down again from the beam--

--stumbles backwards slightly as he catches it--

--hitting the spindly loft railing--

--which suddenly SNAPS

And Nick goes tumbling out into mid-air the slip-knot in the rope
in his hand the only thing keeping him from plummeting 20 feet to
the floor below--

NICK
--Jee-zus--

COTTER

sees it happen on the monitor
COTTER
--Christ

He dashes out of the kitchen
BACK IN THE WORK-LOFT

Heather is trying to lift Nick back up by the rope by sheer
physical strength she doesnt have--

HEATHER
I cant do it

NICK
Dont Youre making me lose my

grip

COTTER (OS)
Im coming Im coming

And Cotter comes dashing in with a tall metal step ladder

COTTER
Just hold on

NICK
I cant

Cotter splays the ladder open starts clambering up it

COTTER
Just let it go Ive got you

NICK
Whatre you nuts--—

COTTER
--its less than four feet
just--

NICK
--shit

Nick loses his grip--starts falling--

--Cotter snatches hold of him as he falls pinning Nick between the
ladder and his torso

The ladder wobbles precariously--

COTTER
--dont move dont even breathe--

--and then the ladder finally comes to a stable rest

Nick is savagely shaken as he slowly climbs down
NICK
Jesusjesusjesus

Ditto Cotter

COTTER
Yeah--please dont do that
again

A giggle is heard from the doorway to the big room They all look
ANNA

is standing there laughing with her hand against her mouth like a
little child She sing-songs

ANNA
I could see up your dress

INT KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT

Cotter Heather and Nick watch the monitors on the table in
silence Drinking coffee They all look majorly exhausted--but none
of them look in any immediate danger of falling asleep Their eyes
dart from monitor to monitor relievedly seeing nothing--except
Anna tossing restlessly in bed

Heather sees that Nick is massaging something on his forearm thats
making him wince Without a word she rolls his sleeve up

A wine-colored mark that looks vaguely like a jagged J

HEATHER
Gothic rune--the letter S

NICK
Or a blood blister--or a bruise

COTTER
Must be that blue collar life we
all lead

Cotter pulls up his pant leg two blurry burgundy marks--crescent
shapes overlapping each other

HEATHER
Thats a j

COTTER
For James

HEATHER
Goes right along with these two

She pulls back her hair--where jaw meets neck two smudgey marks
that together look like badly-drawn lowercase ns
HEATHER
Put ‘em together thats a k
James Kurth--

NICK
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac
or God knows what-else we could have
picked up in the woods

HEATHER
You know what we picked up in the
woods--

--and then theres a sharp knock at the door
All three sets of eyes zoom towards the sound but no one moves

The knocking grows louder more insistent Still they remain
frozen Frightened

They look at the monitor giving an angle of the doorelevator

Nothing can be seen--just a dark blur in the doors peephole
indicating someones standing in the elevator

HEATHER
Who

COTTER
No one ever comes here

NICK
Have to open the door to find
out

The knocking increases along with muffled shouts of

VOICE BEHIND THE DOOR
Cotter Cotter

COTTER
»-DTllgo

Cotter gets up and slowly walks to the door The rapping and
shouting increasing in volume with each step

Finally a deep breath And then Cotter looks through the peep
hole He sees

SID
his Techie friend from the Film Lab glowering back at him
SID

I know youre in there you
piece of shit
COTTER
(quietly)
You have to go

SID
Not until I get that Beta Cam
back Were both in a world of
shit here

COTTER
(quietly)
I cant
SID

Its my fucking job man

COTTER
I cant let you in

Sid starts knocking again

Cotter walks back to the kitchen Sits down in front of the
monitors Watches as the knocking continues Finally stops The
expression on Cotters face never changes

TIME CUT TO - THE SAME - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

So quiet so tense they can hear the clocks ticking all over the
loft 410am

NICK
I should check on Anna

HEATHER
Check the monitor shes fine

NICK
Shes far from fine

HEATHER
Youre needed here--keep watching--

COTTER
--fchrissake Heather its not

HEATHER
--I dont trust anybody not even

COTTER
--shhhh 5 theres something up

Their eyes all go to the Monitor with the view of Cotters work
loft Beat They freeze

A slight WHIRRING--then slow WHOOSHING heard

Cotter gets up

HEATHER
No We all go

Cotter handing a sheaf of print-outs to Heather

COTTER

--its for you Came through email

Heather looks up at them in astonishment dithered

HEATHER

--its the Blair Witch Cult--a copy--

COTTER
--who

HEATHER

Doesnt say--its just these pages

the

She tries to make out the ancient smeared scrawls of this nearly

200 year old book

HEATHER
(reading)

taken by the witch as they were
marked by her--first Jamie Kurth

when the stain appeared on his
brow that next summer--
--the next page is illegible Heather flips forward

HEATHER
for twas said he and Jon Edmunds
and other boys who found Elly Kedward
still on her tree in the snow Poking
her with sticks finding her still
living Taking her bonds and noosing
them to her neck hanging her from
her tree until she perished

Heather looks up at the others in wide-eyed

HEATHER
Thats the little boys Elly Kedward
didnt die from exposure out there
she was executed

(resumes reading)

Killing Elly Kedward but not the
witch herself who floated from the
mortal husk--

Heather looks up she echoes Dominis words

HEATHER
Its why the witch kills children

NICK
I thought all witches were benign and
good

HEATHER

Not this one
INT NICK AND ANNAS BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Heather tries to rouse Anna in bed

HEATHER
I need you to talk to me talk
to me about the dreams--about
James the other boys

ANNA

HEATHER

Try please Anna--

ANNA
--bad boys mean boys cowardly

HEATHER
What do you mean
ANNA

HEATHER
What happened to her where did she

HEATHER
--Anna-—

Anna winces

HEATHER

eye
Heather looks
HEATHER

Not that I can see

ANNA
Closer Lift the lid and look--
it hurts

Heather lifts Annas eyelid gets close to her face and looks

HEATHER
No

ANNA
Closer

And Anna gently guides Heathers face down Begins stroking it And
the next thing Heather knows her body is gravitating towards
Annas Shes kissing her stroking and fondling her as Anna guides
her fingers Pulling down the covers guiding Heather down the
length of her body to--

--a spot on the mattress between Annas legs thats soaked solid
with fresh gleaming blood

Heather yanks herself away now seeing that the entire mattress is
blood-covered Runs from the room

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Heather stares at her face in the mirrored surface of a toaster

Blood blots on her cheek--vaguely in the shape of little palm
prints Shes hyperventilating as she tells Cotter
HEATHER
Rememberwhat Mary Brown said--
she could see the witchs hands on
my face her mouth sucking on mine

COTTER
Annas the witch

Nick enters

NICK
What the fucks going on here

HEATHER
Does she have marks Nick--like the
ones we have that Domini had

NICK
Why

HEATHER
Does she goddamnit

NICK
Not that Ive seen--but that has
no meaning--that means nothing

COTTER
Why was she exempted Nick

NICK
Maybe whatever they are they
just havent appeared yet on
her

HEATHER
You really believe that

Beat

NICK
Its possible for chrissake--

HEATHER
--the marks appear then you
disappear Like the little
Kurth boy like Domini as
soon as they come to full
bloom--and mine are

She pulls down her blouse--the marks on her neck have grown--they
are the size of--and very clear image of--the palm-prints of a
child ringing around Heathers neck as if strangling her

COTTER
Mine too And so are yours
pal

He points to Nicks exposed midriff--the stains have spread up from
his waist into his abdomen--

HEATHER
Like a blueprint for disembowelment

NICK
There are other explanations She is
not the goddamn witch thats insane
HEATHER
Then just give me one of your
explanations that all three of
usll buy

NICK
I dont

--and then Nick hears giggling His eyes and everyones eyes go to
one of the video monitors

THE BIG ROOM

of the loft Where they see Anna twirling round and round on her
tip-toes laughing as though she were simultaneously being hanged
and looking up the dress and giggling at the person being hanged
Now even Nick looks petrified

INT THE LOFT - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - JUST AFTER

The Big Room Nick enters on the run

NICK
I want to see something

ANNA

NICK

HEATHER and NICK
Watch on the monitor Nick showing the huge mark on his torso

NICK

Anna dashes from the room

AT THE ELEVATOR

Heather grabs her as Annas trying to open the door to escape

recorded dogs start barking madly

HEATHER
You killed Domini didnt you

ANNA

Anna runs panicked into the kitchen--and right into Cotter He
grabs her by the arms

COTTER

HEATHER
--well just make you go away

Seen news-film of the inside of the Loft--where Anna was found
murdered And then a closet where an unidentified nude woman was
found similarly executed The News camera zooms in on the nude
body of Domini crumpled in that closet visible rope burns on her
neck
