INT CHURCH - NIGHT

BROTHER MIKE sits in the dark the suitcase at his feet
his only companion His face droops with sadness

FATHER FLYNN appears at the entrance to the church
Deep in prayer Mike doesn’t notice

Father Flynn approaches and places a gentle hand on Mike’s
shoulder

FATHER FLYNN
God be with you Mike

BROTHER MIKE
(mumbling)
And with you Father
Flynn can’t help but notice the luggage at Mike’s side

FATHER FLYNN
Something troubling you Mike

Tears well up in Mike’s eyes but he says nothing
FATHER FLYNN
Whatever it is best to treat it
like a Band-aid
Mike looks up his red rimmed eyes puzzled
FATHER FLYNN
If you remove a Band-aid slowly it
hurts more than the injury it’s
helping to heal But if you do it
quickly

Flynn rips an imaginary Band-aid from his hand

FATHER FLYNN
It’s not nearly so bad So -

Flynn repeats the ripping of the imaginary Band-aid

FATHER FLYNN
Go for it Rip away

Uncertain Mike steels himself
BROTHER MIKE
I’ve had a crisis of faith

FATHER FLYNN
Is that all I thought this was
something serious

BROTHER MIKE
It’s very serious Father Serving
God is my life

Flynn smiles appreciatively at Mike

FATHER FLYNN
Your dedication to the Lord is
praiseworthy When God finally
calls me home my flock will be
well tended

BROTHER MIKE
You don’t understand I have to
leave the church Father

Flynn’s smile fades

FATHER FLYNN
Slow down son Whatever troubles
you remember Corinthians 1012
This too shall pass

BROTHER MIKE
Quoting Bible verses isn’t going to
solve this problem sir

FATHER FLYNN
Come now Mike What could be so
dire that you would sacrifice the
commitment you made to serve God
Mike wrings his hands unsure what to say then commits

BROTHER MIKE
I’m gay

Mike exhales in a deep shudder hugely relieved

BROTHER MIKE
You’re right I do feel better

Flynn takes a seat next to Mike and contemplates
FATHER FLYNN

The Corinthians always were a bunch
of out of touch know it alls
That gets a small nervous laugh out of Mike

FATHER FLYNN
How long have you uh known

BROTHER MIKE
Since I was 9 or 10 I think

Flynn nods searches for the right words

FATHER FLYNN
Would you like to know what I’ve
always loved most about God

Mike considers nods

FATHER FLYNN
He’s always testing us Challenging
us Putting obstacles in our way
and daring us to overcome them

Flynn walks over to the pulpit and removes a bible from his
robe

FATHER FLYNN
A shame that so many of our flock
use this book as a tool by which
they can judge each other

BROTHER MIKE
Church teachings are clear Father
Homosexuality is a sin I must
accept that I am an abomination in
the eyes of the Lord

Flynn slams the bible on the pulpit narrows his eyes
FATHER FLYNN
Do you realize how many things are

wrong with what you just said

BROTHER MIKE
Father

Flynn’s brief anger is quickly replaced by calm He gestures
towards the statue of Jesus on the cross

FATHER FLYNN
What do you think Jesus would do if
he were here instead of me

Mike shrugs
FATHER FLYNN
Would he berate you Judge you
Kick you out of the church

Mike considers for a moment

BROTHER MIKE
You think he’d forgive me

FATHER FLYNN
Nope I think he’d love you I
think he’d have compassion for the
pain you’re experiencing

Overcome with emotion Mike shudders cries quietly

BROTHER MIKE
The Bible says -

FATHER FLYNN
The Bible is a guide a map for us
to follow to find God during the
darkest times of our lives But
it’s a map for a world two thousand
years dead

Mike’s eyes widen in shock

BROTHER MIKE
You don’t believe the Bible

Flynn chuckles

FATHER FLYNN
I read it I learn from it and seek
guidance from its teachings But do
I believe in it No It’s just a
book

He places a friendly hand on Mike’s shoulder

FATHER FLYNN
What I believe in is God A loving
God A forgiving God A God who
makes no mistakes only decisions
we’re not smart enough to
understand

BROTHER MIKE
But -
FATHER FLYNN
Were all here because of God son
Straight or gay or somewhere in
between I believe God created all
of us in infinite diversity He has
a plan Youre part of it

BROTHER MIKE
I get what you’re saying sir But
even if I believe that once our
parishioners find out

FATHER FLYNN
Are you going to tell them

Mike shakes his head slowly
Flynn gestures again to Jesus on the cross

FATHER FLYNN
Is HE going to tell them

Mike smirks shakes his head again

FATHER FLYNN
Well I’m certainly not going to
tell anyone

Flynn motions for Mike to stand

FATHER FLYNN
I’m very good at keeping secrets
Mike In fact there’s one I’ve
been keeping for a very long time

He pauses for effect

FATHER FLYNN
Since I was 9 or 10 I think

It takes a moment but Mike finally gets it and his face
transforms from desolate to joyful in an instant

BROTHER MIKE
I understand Father Your secret
is safe with me

FATHER FLYNN
The Lord needs good shepherds for
his flock Mike I truly believe
his only requirement for the job is
a loving heart - regardless of who
that heart loves
Mike wipes his tear stained cheeks in relief

BROTHER MIKE
Thank you Father You’re the best

Flynn laughs then laughs harder
FATHER FLYNN

I don’t know if I’m the best Mike

but one thing I do know for sure -

Another pause for effect

FATHER FLYNN
I’m Fabulous

Flynn smiles at Mike picks up his bag and walks with him out
of the church

FADE OUT
