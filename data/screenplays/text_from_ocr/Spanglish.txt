SHOOTING DRAFT

FADE IN

1 INT BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON

A shape fills the lower portion of the screen It is a mans
back a perfect back good dark color slim muscular
LATIN MUSIC PLAYS a song if you understood the words
you would hear love confronted and considered in a very
specific wayWe are in a Mexico City suburb The day is
hot small beads of sweat are seen on the mans back the
first indication that we are in slow motionPerfect red
fingernails come into viewand now a womans hand goes
beautifully to workpart sensual back scratch part
massage The hand cups bits of the mans back a strong thumb
probes his spine a long finger teases the very top of his
ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --
and as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for
another trip down his upper body

MAIN TITLES BEGIN Full titles minute after minute of titles
with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
rub the man making sounds of pleasure The hand is getting
tired Flirtatious no more this is getting to be workThe
unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously the man says a
single sound urging her to continue the exhausted hand
complies then stops then the unseen woman changes hands as
TITLES CONTINUE The new hand wearing a wedding ring
goes to work then it too stops to restthe man says
something in Spanishimportant for us because it will
establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we
understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue She
replies in Spanish lightheartedly with a small and pretty
laugh that her hands are tired We understand The man tells
her to continue She continues the rub now desultory and
resentful She stops for another rest The man wants more and
grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view

for the first time She says in Spanish with no particular
anger you said you would never push me around again If you
do I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own
back as high as you want (NOTE All Spanish dialogue will
be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish
peakingworking in tidbits or extra exposition jokes etc)
or now the mans tone changes placating her to continue
ven as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic
rgument in Spanish This is no longer a massage we envy

his back rub going as it does from sex and hope to discord
nd alienation will be our only full direct knowledge of
heir marriage

INTEXT BEDROOM DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE

Showing us the room and beyond through the window a school
bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road

We now see the full figure of the womans back as she looks
up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word

Cristina When the man protests her stopping she indicates
they should both run and meet their daughter He waves her
off Stunned by his disinterest she runs from the room

EXT DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS

As CRISTINA six years old and adorable waits patiently to
step down She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly
digging into her little pack to pull out an English book
which she displays with pride Now she steps down from the
bus and as she walks TOWARD CAMERA narration begins The
voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see

NARRATOR

To Princeton Universitys Director
of Admissions In considering me
for a scholarship you have asked
for and have every reason to
expect an essay from me about
myself And as a clever high
school graduate I of course
realize the subtext of this essay
about who I am and why I want to
enter Princeton is actually to
make clear to you why you should
have me I have gotten tips from
friends who have preceded me to
college that being a Latina with
my grades list of activities and
relative poverty I am as good as
in if I simply do the dance and
work in a word like
bipolarization every so often
And while I love dances -- this
dance of self is one I am afraid to
master

(young girl looks off and

lights up)
I prefer to write about my mother

INT EXT HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRLS POV - MOM

A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20s As mother
and daughter move inside a car pulls up with an ominous man
getting out He nods in another direction calling our
attention to a police car parked off the street The woman

does not

The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the

child hasthis is one supportive momagain she is
disbelieving that her husband shows no interest especially

first day at school
INT KITCHEN HUSBANDS ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

This room is directly across from the husbands room The
woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show
the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches
The man gives her husband some moneyall the time the woman
is chattering to distract the girl Looking off --the woman
grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money The
undercover cop begins shouting orders The woman raises her
voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles
her daughter

NARRATOR

There was never any pretense that
the gorgeous vital clever
temperamental animal that was my
mother ever for a heartbeat
considered having any life of her
own She ignored all her needs and
was alive only for me It was
terrific

(a long beat)
At the time

ON MOM

As she watches her daughter chew a cookie Her daughter
begins to tell about her day her young mother taking on a
glow we have not yet seen And all the while she eyes the
action in the next room Her husband makes a break for the
window The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing
to fire a warning shot The woman moves ever so quickly to a
shelf of her favorite dishes all the while talking to her
daughter making much over the kids new school books It is
an impressive charade

FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS

And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling in perfect timing
she upsets the dishes the resulting noise covering the
shot The woman asks her daughter what she learned
todaythe daughter says she was taught a little English
Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband
toward the front door where other police await Her daughter
starts to follow her gaze and she distracts herbrandishing
the SpanishEnglish book and asking her to say something

Hi
The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
though outside her lifes mate is being loaded into the
back of a police car (Note Mexican police DO NOT duck the
perpetrators head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEATthey
just allow the concussion) It seems the mother will save her
child the trauma of her father being carted off but the
police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
father as the car pulls away The child is stricken A tear
starts to form in her eye Her mother acts quickly We are
about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
willthe mother leans down gives three quick kisses - power
pecks - to the girls cheeks and then an admonition in
Spanish

child fascinated by all

left herself behind

EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE

Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep
explosive smile

BACK TO SCENE music plays and we focus on Cristina now
nearing 12 years of agedancing with her mother and some
other smaller children The mother eyes the muscular back of
a Great Looking Manwho turns and quickly oozes quality
sex appeal She is turned onThey talk in Spanishhim
saying something hushed like I have been afraid to talk to
you I need oxygen when I look at you She indicates the six
children she is dancing with and offers to include him in
some ring around the rosey danceHe indicates the magic of
just the two of themShe quickly leads her little flock
away

OTHER ANGLE

A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at themat
first the mother thinks this is adorablethe child eyeing
her as if he were a manshe indicates he should join the
rest of the children for a dance

MOVING WITH THE BOY

As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is
interested in Before the mom can do anything about it he
asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts

ON CRISTINA

Satellite virginities falling with alarming speedthe first
time held by a male the first time held close the first
sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male
eyes which utterly confuses Cristina He begins to grind his
hips into his dancing partner

ON HER MOTHER

Not confused It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about
to be run down by a caronly this time the thing to do is
scare the car

She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming
his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts
him and throws him to the sidelines Then pats him on the
head maternally and goes back to Cristina

CRISTINA
Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene
NARRATOR

That quickly it was clear she could
no longer work two jobs and leave
me to my own at night The
following morning she did something
about it A boy I never saw again
had changed our lives

She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirtShe is
a perfect dresser meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesnt care while every article is a true and gifted find
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the dont

Our heroine seeing the blood flow from her aunts nose
gestures that Monica needs help not conversation

DEBORAH (CONTD)

make when your nose is bleeding
Shut up Deborah

BERNICE

Deborah grabs at paper towels gets an ice pack from the
freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the
kitchenShe has moment to moment the enormous desire to
feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can
experience

DEBORAH

Here take these

(second thought)
Was that strange to give you
moneyI just felt badly that

MONICA

Its okay
She pockets the cash

30 EXT HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Moments later As the group arrives at the outdoor table
Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking
hands nodding indicating a seateach simple act a test
which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then
somesimply too much for her to manage with the drinks under
her belt In the background workers roll out sod the yard
becoming more beautiful even as we look

MONICA

She is my niece She and her
daughter live in the apartment I
manage Yolanda who worked for

(to visitors)
Dont you want to get out of the
sun
She indicates a shaded seat Deborah is protected by hat
umbrella sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded
enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine Underneath
Deborahs surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt
emotionsat this moment she is earnest and vulnerable

DEBORAH (TO OUR GAL) (CONTD)

You guys want some lemonade

(they demur)
Lets just talk I have two
children My husband works
nightshes a chef and has his own

loose and meticulous at the same

time Its all about first names

The two visitors exchange a wide-eyed look Which Deborah
sees and understands

DEBORAH (CONTD)

(to Monica)
Im not leaving time for you to
translate
Monica says in Spanish this woman is very strange The
only thing I understand is she has two kids Deborah leans
into Monica Face to face tender but unblinking

DEBORAH (CONTD)
Too bad for you that it just never
occurred to you to check on how
much Spanish I know

MONICA

(a solid beat of
humiliation then)
Im sorry what I say about

BERNICE

DEBORAH

I dont speak any Spanish But Im
not an idiot - I talk for an hour
and you say two words What did you

DEBORAH (CONTD)

Never mind You got your nose

bopped I got my feelings hurt

Onward
As Monica paraphrases what has happened her translation is
DIALED DOWN for the

NARRATOR

(as Deborah continues

talking)
I will major in linguistics and
make sociology my sub-
concentration Because it has been
my experience that the barriers of

NARRATOR (contd)
language are more than we dare
admit That as much as we
translate finally we will never
understand each other My mothers
name for example beautiful in
Spanish becomes leaden and awful
when pronounced by a non-Latin

Flor says to Monica in Spanish a tip to pronounce her name
Monica warns Flor to leave it restsince Deborah is becoming
clearly and strangely pissed
DEBORAH (CONTD)

What did she say

CLOSE ON FLOR
She feels the tension but so far in her life her own
irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves
forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance
She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now for the
first time she is through Monica talking directly to
Deborah

MONICA

(translating)
She saysIf you curl your tongue
and let it be loose you will have
itthat its hard for Americans
She says its great that you try so
hard Many people wouldnt bother

DEBORAH

(an emotional
pronouncementher
greatest accolade)
She gets me
She smiles at Flor who returns the smile

DEBORAH (CONTD)

She pours some for Flor and Monica Then she closes her eyes
and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort

DEBORAH (CONTD)

Monica translatesFlor embarrassed a bit by the directness

DEBORAH (CONTD)
No This is an important

questionif you ask for too little
it means you dont value

yourselftoo much and youre
taking advantage
(after Monica translates)
So
Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not
without some native wit and style to maneuver around it

FLOR

As he moves on we see in the background the workers unwrap
and react to a fantastic concoction A caterer (who we may
notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and
whispers to him

CATERER

She came down to check on the party
and realized the gardeners hadnt
finished rolling the sod

INT EXT CLASKY HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT 35

JOHNS POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS

Deborah is wearing a party dress They are rolling out the
last huge cylinder of sod completing the now beautifully
manicured backyard It is hard manual labor involving
physical strength The female caterers are complaining that
its too heavy but Deborah is undeterred

DEBORAH
(to catering women)
We can do it Come on
She falls over the rollgetting filthybut it gives and
they gain momentumone of the catering women falling down
one losing pace Deborahhowever gains the upper hand Yet
even while succeeding she remonstrates herself

DEBORAH (CONTD)

(great exertion)

Why do I care so
much about CRAP
And now she wins the cylinder of grass rolls all the way

out and she jumps on the seam in victory She is dirty
spent and triumphantthe components for a solid sexual
experienceand in truth as the exhausted caterers half-
heartedly applaud the bizarre victory she has gotten off
She looks with mothers pride at the lawn Then sees John

DEBORAH (CONTD)
Can you believe they left without
finishing

As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at herA
grinhalf laugh He loves the dame

DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONTD)

Looks great huh Youre not
looking

fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
soall details thought about and done to a T This is
the outdoor lighting nobody nailsthe twinkling of a half
acrethe path to the pool like a runway to heaven As she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment

DEBORAH (CONTD)

(a replenishing sigh)
Okay Were okay here

(then)
Why cant everything be like sod
Theres no wait no dung nothing
you have to do right and yet its
perfect It covers up all your
dirt and makes things immediately
prettythen the miracle if you
just give it time it roots and you
cant tell it from the real thing

(a look to her husband)
No reaction Nothing to say

JOHN

Huh Oh sureI uhWell no I
dont have anything particular to
say

DEBORAH

Oh John why dont you just take
out a knife and kill me all
together

Somewhat crushed she prepares to exit

JOHN

Howd you get thereHey wait a
minuteDebstopcome on

(she turns)
Id like to figure this one out
What would have been the great
thing for me to say after you said
the sod sentenceReally

DEBORAH

Thats actually a good question
JOHN

There you go I surprise sometimes
DEBORAH

I would have liked if after I
compared the sod to life if you
had said Exactly

She turns to leave

JOHN

Yeah But to say that and mean it
Id have to think the same way you
do

DEBORAH

(some sense of mischief)
Its worth a tryI had something

Her mother enters on her way upstairs She is thoughtful
tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her
current demon She greets Flor and then shakes her head
making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to
Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker

Tough day
Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while in the bg a
GOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with
a ball in its mouth Flor is checking out the kitchen

self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice

He signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large
but tentative step away from the spot where he was
standingthen additional faster steps He gestures with
enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the
room She eyes him suspiciously

JOHN

Just for a second
She walks to himhe puts an arm around her shoulder And
gestures back to where they were standing He talks in an
almost hushed conspiratorial voice

But hes just two lines into an old blues standard

DEBORAH

It doesnt do any good now

Georgie
She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes
up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid-
song Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a
divider between parent and child But Deborah is calling for
her to pay attention to the cars navigation screen a
Spanish voice says route guidance system starting

DEBORAH (CONTD)

Ive programmed it for Spanish

Look it will take you anywhere and

then back home If you figured out

how to make coffee on that thing

if Flor were not there he would be talking to himself
anyway in the manner of bag ladies and all of us

JOHN (CONTD)

I am running out of excuses for the

lady of the house
Flor doesnt understand his wordsyet fully agrees But
then John takes rein of his emotions

JOHN (CONTD)

But you know you gotta watch out
for the times you think youre
absolutely rightBut man Bernice
has finals tomorrow She didnt
need this oneAnd just that look
on her face when she got the gifts--
(now his voice cracks he
grows wet-eyed)
--like for a second she thought all
her problems with her mother had
been solved
Flor is flabbergastedshe peeks to see if he is actually
crying At first her heart is touched by John but then there
is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the
macho meter can read that low He looks at her and she faces
front quickly

NARRATOR

My mother did not understand her
male boss His heart was good and
he was rare in not flirting with
her But they were starkly
different Privacy and dignity were
the same word to my mother
Naturally when she found herself
sitting next to a man who cried
over his childs hurt she had no
idea how to process the event
Meanwhile he has stopped for traffic near the end of the
canyon Flor takes the opportunity to bolt

FLOR

Gracias
She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is
still rolling a bit

JOHN
What are you doing Let me take you
all the way
Reluctantly she re-enters the carIt rolls another ten feet
to her bus stop and she gets out again

ask my help that I realized
immediately she was losing her
battle to be uninvolved with the

Flor asks her daughter how to say something in English

CRISTINA

Try it on
Flor asks again in Spanishtrying to find a precise
phrase The nuance important to her

CRISTINA (CONTD)
Please try it on
Flor knows the word pleaseits not what she wantswhat
she wants is a way to say try it on in a manner which is
not a requestor order but is rather friendly and caring
Her daughter works on the problem

thing has to get dealt with

BERNICE

(reading from newspaper)
John Clasky who at 25 made his
mark on the New York restaurant
scene when JAMMED lived up to and
survived its silly name has re-
emerged as a young and confident
veteran taking chances with his
combinations in so subtle a
manner

GEORGIE
If he gave me six
JOHN

Wait a minute your sisters
talking
Evelyn indicates to Flor that the good news is about
Johnand so she studies hima bit

BERNICE

beginning with the succession
of appetizers each one with its
own stunning and fully realized
agenda is constantly yet casually
daring
(emotional and earnest
aside)
Ah Dadthis is so great
(to others)
Now heres the thing
She tears upEvelyn rubs Bernies backlooks at Flor and
taps her heartFlor indicates she should leave and does
Bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and
moment John is taken with his daughters delivery

BERNICE (CONTD)
Eating at this perfect smaller
passionate restaurant inspires
ones own abandonment of caution

To wit John Clasky is the best
chef in the United States

JOHN

DEBORAH

Okay So that would be
JOHN

My dream response from you yes
DEBORAH

against men

And I was all worried about
figuring out the timing just to
talk to you about renting a place
for the summer

ANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA

As they enter Cristina translating her mothers words

CRISTINA

My mother wishes
exactly what she
else

And so for the remainder of the

me to represent
says nothing

scene Flor will speak in

Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her
mothers emotion sometimes including body language It is
not only a translation but a reenactment

CRISTINA AS FLOR

May I talk to you

JOHN

You mean your mother
Cristina nodsnot comfortable breaking the rule of only
speaking for her motherShe faces him her back to Flor

JOHN (CONTD)
(looking at Flor)
Sure you can talk to me
Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish
CRISTINA AS FLOR
I dont have to sleep first

JOHN

Whats wrong
Flor waves the moneyCristina waves an empty hand as she
speaks for her mother

CRISTINA AS FLOR

Did you give this money to my
daughter

JOHN

I made this little dealwith all
the kids to

CRISTINA AS FLOR

(interrupting)
Please
Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now
translates from the background

CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONTD)

You dont tell or ask the mother
when you give a child a fortune for
looking on the beach for
stoneswhat is the word for this

JOHN
Sea glass

On hearing the translation of sea glass an exasperated Flor
turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him

ON FLOR

CRISTINA AS FLOR

Nonot a name for the stonesa
name for the actwhat you did

As she spits out the word to her daughter

ON JOHN

As his eyes

FLOR

Engreldo

shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear
JOHN

Oh noengretdos going to be
rough

ON CRISTINA

Reluctantly
deliver the

taking the emotional stance of her mother to
word

CRISTINA

(briefly being herself)
Its hard to translate

She takes half a beatfinds the word and now spits it out

CRISTINA AS FLOR

Smug

John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so
that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for John

JOHN
I had no idea it would amount to
that kind of moneyI thought ---
sort of tops fifty dollars

CRISTINA AS FLOR
Fifty dollars is a lot of money
JOHN

Okay Right
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say

JOHN (CONTD)

(sighing to himself)
Ah shit
That fast Cristina translates Before Flor can react John
talks directly to Florquietcompassionate a bit beaten

JOHN (CONTD)

Im sorryI get why you are
upset It might not look it but I
am good at getting things Doing
something about it is something
elseI was going to talk to you
before I actually gave her the
moneybut maybe I should have
checked before I started the whole
thing
(he smilesthey dont)

I know what its like when you feel
your kid is being messed withI
get the message It wont happen
again Its lateIm sure wed all
like

Flor lets it outher daughter hard pressed to keep up

CRISTINA AS FLOR

To whatsleep If this was small
enough to be helped by some little
apology I would be a fool to bring
it upI need to say more no matter
what the result I need to be
impolite You leave someone elses
child alone Its simple no It
is too easy for children to feel
contradictionsIt encourages
questioning their parentsand that
makes them less safe Your wife
takes her for rides and changes her
hairYou give her money Here
(this next sentence
Cristina translates with
alarm and adds her own
question mark)

Flor hands John the envelope under her daughters wrenching
gaze They begin to exitbut Flor turns inadvertently
bumping into her daughter Her voice softens

CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONTD)
I did not mean to be angry to you -
only emotional
They turn to leave John speaks with sudden volume and
muscle
JOHN
What about hypocritical
Cristina turns backconfusedher mother asks her for a

translation and she complies Flor then wearing the same
confused expression

JOHN (CONTD)

Yeah you heard me Its not like
you didnt do the same thing

FLOR

(hard on the translation)
No
JOHN

Oh yes So go lecture

yourselfyou wont need a

translator for that oneI mean

what am I lately A recycling

binjust anyone dump in your

garbage and hope I make something

useful out of it
Flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and
pointing a finger at her

JOHN (CONTD)

Yes you did the same thingyou

think I didnt know about altering

those outfits for BernieShe tells

me her stuffSo am I missing

something Is there a real

difference between that and what

you are complaining about
Cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
translatebut doesnt get oneInstead her mother is a bit
mortified and considerably humbledthe pie smack into the
face

FLOR
Sin diferencia Yo interferl
CRISTINA AS FLOR
No difference I interfered
JOHN

Okay Im still not sure I did
the right thing keeping it to
myself It felt disloyal to
Deborah but my daughter really
needed someone to be kind to her
right thensoso

CRISTINA AS FLOR

I am very embarrassed You are very
right Hypocrisyyes

JOHN
(something strikes him he
softens disoriented)
Ill tell you its pretty wild to
say something and have the other
person just concede the point Im
dazed here
CRISTINA AS FLOR

I will leave whenever it is good
for you and

JOHN
Nonocome on man
CRISTINA AS FLOR

But how can I work for you after we
talk like this

JOHN

You cant quit even if you want to
and you know why

FLOR
No
JOHN

Yes you do
Flor is worried as John looks right at herIs he coming on

JOHN (CONTD)
Because then Cristina will blame

herself for costing you the
joband that guiltI dont know
if you know about guilt
Cristina doesnt have to check with her mother on this one

CRISTINA

Culpa guilt sil We know We are
Catholics

FLOR
(after her daughters
translation)

system kind of insists on the
illusion that youve learned math --
so they make you go to summer

that they have failed in their

here

DEBORAH
What is it Are you buzzed

EVELYN

No I gave up drinking weeks ago
(on Deborahs reaction)

Yes Nobody noticed -- which shows

I probably conducted myself pretty

well as a drunk But duty called

and Im sober so may I say just one

thing

DEBORAH
One thinggo ahead

EVELYN
ThanksDeborah youre going to
lose your husband and youll never
find someone as good There will
only be men who you know are cheap
and shallow and have no real warmth
in their souls You may have gotten
by on those surfaces once but now
youve been spoiled by a good man
and you can no longer glide on such
thin ice If you do not act
quickly you will soon cement an
awful fate for yourself A life
with no hope of repair which has
already begun to turn desperate and
dumb Thats it Drive safely

She grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the

and you dont know what I
didthere is a real limit to how
close we can beyoure with me and
m this person who has this bad
secret and we arent really on the
same page ever againso the reason

because I want us to be goodI
want us to be close I want to

feel like youre not nuts to be in

should talk till we pass out

FLOR
I understand what you mean

JOHN

FLOR

That its getting late That

scratchy when she speaks

I am enjoying actually being of use
to my daughter I am enjoying the
fact that I really know how to

advise you and the miracle that you

are so deeply disoriented that you

are gobbling up everything I say
Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a
somewhat new wayas if Evelyn were an actual person instead
of an upsetting extension of herself

DEBORAH

Theres one thing Id like to say

to you about you and me

EVELYN

You dont have to

DEBORAH
I want to
EVELYN
Okay
DEBORAH

(quite vulnerable and

appealing)
You were an alcoholic and wildly
promiscuous woman during my
formative years so that I am in
this fix because of you It is your
fault I just needed

(gestures heart to heart)
that moment for us

EVELYN

You have a solid point dear But

Do you know that right now you are
your own worst enemythat you

yourself to say one thing to

himOne thingIm so glad

DEBORAH
Huh
EVELYN
Yes
DEBORAH
(babbling)

But Ive got to know whether he
touched her - where he touched her -
how he touched her - if they broke
a sweat --- what they said - who
made the first move - how they left
it -- if anyone loves anyone or has
an intention of making contact in
the future - what she wore - how he
felt afterwards - whether anyone
mentioned me
(a wail)
whether they held hands when they
left
The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs

EVELYN
Just those words I said If you
want a prayer of coming out of
this
DEBORAH
I know youre rightBut
EVELYN
But what
DEBORAH

Despite herself Bernice starts to crymoans to herself over
the displayNow in the background we hear a subliminal
human voice Incrementally it will grow louder and be
recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom
windowBit by bit the others will become aware of this as
Flor ignores itBernice goes to embrace Cristina

BERNICE

My last chance to have some of you
rub off on me

(Cristina doesnt

understand)
Im sorry youre so sad but this
could have been so much worse

CRISTINA
(from her depths)
How
And now Deborah calling Flor is getting hard to ignore but
Flor manages

EVELYN

(to Cristina)
Why dont you run upstairs and say
goodbye to Deborah
Flor flashes a look of thanks

FLOR

Ill be in front
Upset Cristina runs off She kisses Berniceand walks
toward the house As she passes under the bedroom

DEBORAH

Please come see me
And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck Flor glances
up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly
hears the beginning of their exchange

DEBORAHS VOICE

Its okay honeywell see each
other at schoolIm going to keep
an eye on youI will

Flor enters the house

181 INT KITCHEN - DAY 181

She stands waitingwalks to the hallway and cranes her head
to see into rooms wondering if John is there Finally as
she passes the stairwell she sees Cristina on an upper
landing and says in Spanish that Cristina should get her
things and meet her out front Cristina agitated moves off
to complythen Deborah appears in the same spot

DEBORAH

Please stick your head in here for
a minute
Flor nods and starts up the stairs

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Deborah holds open the door while Flor walks insidethen

DEBORAH (CONTD)

DEBORAH

DEBORAH

(truly hurt)

Well Im very very disappointed
to hear that It makes me feel like

(compassion forces a
crumb)

connectedin a bad way

DEBORAH

(strangely soothed)
You know something I think were
saying the same thingLook as

last night
Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined

FLOR

I can only tell you what I did

DEBORAH
That will be sufficient
FLOR

(these are tender

feelings)
I became sure of what an incredibly
lucky woman you are and I must make
myself not envy you which is hard
No its not hard Its impossible
Now pleaseI am exhausted

DEBORAH

Deborah would hugbut its only an eighth of a gesture
because Flor has turned to exit calling for her daughter to
hurry as she goes

FLOR
Cristina aptrate
183 EXT CLASKY HOUSE - DAY 183

As she exits the house and moves to the gate where she
punches in the exit code

ANGLE ON GATE
As it swings open to reveal John
184 EXT STREET - DAY 184
As she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her
JOHN
I was hanging out here waiting
Cant give you guys a lift
Flor shakes her head no She looks away for a beat so the
next thing she does is a considered action She leans forward
and kisses him on the lips John looks at her
JOHN (CONTD)
This is killer
(on her confusion)
Incredibly hard
FLOR
Yes Cari
The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful
of loot

JOHN

(reading Flor)
Let her have itparty favors

She nodsbites back some emotion and turns from him

FLOR
Cristina
CRISTINA

Goodbye Mr ClaskyI am very

sorry we will not see each other as

frequently
She offers her hand which John shakes while patting her on
the back

FLOR

Yes
They turn and begin walking down the street

SHOT - STONE CANYON

The women walking toward camera John briefly in the
backgroundAs they begin their walk Flor begins talking in
Spanish

NARRATOR

The first minute we were alone my
mother told me that I would no
longer go to the private school

CRISTINA

No NoYou cant I wont be able

to forgive youIt will be the end

I wont let you
And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops
walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along
with enormous dedication CAMERA BEGINS A PULL BACK
Cristina dropping presentspicking them upone of them left
by the waysidePeople noticingCristinas conduct violating
tacit zoning laws

CLOSER SHOT
So we can see their faces in the struggle
EXT BUS STOP 185

As they waitFlor talks sharply to Cristina to control
herself

NARRATOR

My mother changed our lives once
more This time because she saw in
me to her great alarm a character
flaw of some size She has taught
me to be a watch dog of my
character to control my ambition
I am not quite there

One last yelp from Cristina as the bus arrives

INT BUS - DAY 186

Almost empty - its Saturday Mother and daughter sit
together by the giant window in the center of the bus
Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak
with stoic dignity The girl is becoming less inconsolable
and more in need of mothering

NARRATOR (CONTD)

For that reason should you choose
to grant me your scholarship my
mother at my request will be
relocating to the New York
Metropolitan Area so that she can
stay close during my time at

Princeton
Cristina moves closer to Flor who senses it immediately and
wraps her in her arms kisses her head

NARRATOR (CONTD)

I hope my essay has done her
justice I love her with all my
heart
