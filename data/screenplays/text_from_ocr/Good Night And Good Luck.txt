INT CHICAGO THEATER

October 15 1958 The Radio and Television News Directors
Association Annual meeting

We’re in the wings of the theater Standing there alone
is Edward R Murrow He looks slightly ill at ease He
lights a cigarette he looks at some notes in his hand
as we overhear his glowing introduction by the MC

Cheers and applause as we walk with him to the podium
A long awkward pause

MURROW
This might just do nobody any
good At the end of this
discourse a few people may accuse
this reporter of fouling his own
comfortable nest and your
organization may be accused of
having given hospitality to
heretical and even dangerous
thoughts

cur TO

Close ups of people listening Smiling Not aware that
this is not to be the comfortable acceptance speech you
might hear of a retiring employee getting his gold watch
This will become what will later be called “The Box of
Lights and Wires Speech” One of THE MOST IMPORTANT
broadcast journalism speeches EVER It is an attack on
everyone in this room an attack on himself And at
this point it has just begun

MURROW (CONTD)

But the elaborate structure of
Networks Advertising Agencies and
Sponsors will not be shaken or
altered It is my desire if not
my duty to try to talk to you
journeymen with some candor about
what is happening to radio and
television If what I have to say
is responsible then I alone am
responsible for the saying of it

Qo

MURROW
Our history will be what we make
of it And if there are any
historians about fifty or a
hundred years from now and there
should be preserved the Kinescopes
for one week of all three
networks they will there find
recorded in black and white or
color evidence of decadence
escapism and insulation from the
realities of the world in which we
live We are currently wealthy
fat comfortable and complacent
We have a built in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing
information Our mass media
reflect this But unless we get up
off our fat surpluses and
recognize that television in the
main is being used to distract
delude amuse and insulate us
then television and those who
finance it those who look at it
and those who work at it may see
a totally different picture too
late

CUT TO

Over black we read The little picture

INT NEWSROOM

Our story starts in a busy TV newsroom The CBS Newsroom
to be exact The year is 1953 We’re following a young
female NATALIE as she carries a tray with six cups of
coffee For the next few moments shell give us a tour
of the newsroom Secretaries typing The AP and UP wire
clicking away A camera crew runs by A young delivery
boy ED JONES with several cans of film stops us

NATALIE ED
Okay I’ll give it to Leo Charlie wanted me to
How many cans is it itwhat Oh

It’s two cans There’s
some notes that go with
Fred’s in with the guys for Fred
you cant go in

NATALIE
Ill get the notes to Fred and you
can go ahead and give the film to

Leo

NATALIE ED
Hes in projection In the projection room
yes the projection room Okay Thanks Natalie

Thanks Ed

We now follow ED as NATALIE heads down the corridor
stops in the copier room where a mimeograph machine is
rolling out copies There is also coffee in the room
which is why Ed has stopped in Off to one corner
SHIRLEY is filing folders while JOE WERSHBA is making
copies at the mimeograph

ED
Hey Joe Shirley What’s going
on in here

WERSHBA SHIRLEY
Ed Just making some Hello Ed Nothing
copies for the
ED

people alone in the copy room

Ed finishes getting his coffee

ED
Well rules are made to be broken
WERSHBA SHIRLEY
I think he’s right (To Ed)
Shirley What’ya say we You can afford to say that

grab a drink tonight
WERSHBA
It might be good for you to get
out a little

Shirley smiles

ED
Just a couple of guys trying to
help
As Ed leaves
SHIRLEY

The day I need dating advice from
you two knuckleheads is the

We hear Ed laughing down the hall We stay on Joe and
Shirley who just stare at each other in silence Then
the mood suddenly becomes more serious

SHIRLEY
Let me see this I don’t know

He hands her a concealed paper

WERSHBA
Its simply a Loyalty Oath”
Theres nothing in it about

SHIRLEY
To CBS

WERSHBA SHIRLEY
To America You promise to be a
loyal American
All the reporters have
it Fred signed it Who are you promising this
to CBSPaley
Murrow too Murrow signed
it Murrow signed it

( )

They sit and look at each other She reads it again

WERSHBA SHIRLEY
I’ve had it for a while (Reading)
I thought it was a joke at “Bre you now or have you
first but there’s a lot ever been a member of these
of pressure I don’t organizations that appeared
know on the Attorney General’‘s

list of subversive groups”

SHIRLEY
Alright let’s think about it
What is it really saying is it
a civil liberties issue Is it
censorship

WERSHBA

I don’t know Is it simply
stating for CBS that I’m not a

communist
SHIRLEY
Murrow signed it
WERSHBA SHIRLEY
And Fred and Stanton Maybe you should talk to
Murrow
SHIRLEY

If you dont sign it are you and
Ia target

WERSHBA

If I don’t sign it theyll fire
me

Shirley leans over puts her hand on top of his and gives
him a quick kiss

SHIRLEY
Well at least then we can tell
everyone the truth

As she exits

INT SCREENING ROOM - DAY 1953

We fade up It’s fairly dark Projected on the wall is
£ CARTHY being introduced by MR KEEFE

footage of MC

a

In the foreground - silhouetted are several of the
greatest newsmen of their generation but they don’t
know it yet PALMER WILLIAMS - EDDIE SCOTT JESSE
ZOUSMER - FRED FRIENDLY - DON HEWITT - JOE WERSHBA - JOHN
AARON - CHARLIE MACK all young

They are to become known as “Murrow’s Team” and this room
is the place where the standard for broadcast journalism
will be founded

Quietly seated in the very back is MURROW
As they look on we see the footage

MR KEEFE
Well you’d sometimes think to
hear the quartet that call
themselves “Operation Truth”
damning Joe McCarthy and resorting
to the vilest smears Ive ever
heard Well This is the answer
And if I could express it in
what’s in my heart right now Id
do it in the terms of the poet who
once said Ah ‘tis but a dainty
flower I bring to you Yes ‘tis
but a violet glistening with dew
But still in its heart there lies
beauties concealed So in our
heart our love for you lies
unrevealed”

MCCARTHY
You know I used to-- pride
myself on the idea that I was a
bit tough especially over the
past eighteen or nineteen months
and we’ve been kicked around then
bullwhipped and damned (tearing
up) didn’t think that-- T
could be touched very deeply But
tonight frankly my cup and my
heart is so full I can’t talk to

you
FRIENDLY
Leo that’s enough turn it off
ZOUSMER WERSHBA
What poet was that ‘Tis but a dainty flower I

bring to you

ae

ZOUSMER
No Hey Don who wrote
that

AARON
I believe it was Roy
Cohn

ZOUSMER
Its funny I didn’t think
its all that damning
but it is funny

FRIENDLY
No there’s nothing really
But it sure is fun to see
the Junior Senator
wallowing

scorTrT

MURROW
Theres a story here in the
Detroit Free Press Dexter
Michigan a kid named Milo
Radulovich

FRIENDLY
Italian

MURROW
Irish Air Force kicked him out
because his dad read some Serbian
newspaper they call Milo a
security risk

FRIENDLY

Is his dad a communist Who
brought the charges

MURROW
I dont know the Air Force
the charges were in a sealed
envelope nobody saw them

FRIENDLY
Not even at the hearing

MURROW
He was declared guilty without a
trial and told if he wanted to
keep his job he’d have to denounce
his father and his sister so he
told ‘em to take a hike

PRIENDLY
His sister

MURROW
Let’s send Joe and Charlie down

Milo Radulovich

cUT TO

INT CONTROL ROOM

A close up of a monitor (Kinescope) of Milo Radulovich
talking

MILO
Yes if I am being judged on my
relatives are my children going
to be asked to denounce me are
they gonna be judged on what their
father was labeled are they
going to have to explain to their
friends etc why their father is
a security risk I see a chain
reaction that has no end to
anybody

We pull out and were in the control room watching this
on screen In the BG we see the darkened News set In
the foreground sits MURROW FRIENDLY and FRANK STANTON
second in charge at CBS

Stanton isnt pleased
STANTON

Well that’s new I don’t think
you can call this a neutral piece

MURROW FRIENDLY
Frank I think the other We tried to talk to the Air
sides been represented Force they haven’t gone on
rather well for the last record Their lawyers
couple of years if wont unseal the

envelopeI

STANTON
So you just want to forego the
standards that youve stuck to for

fifteen years both sides no
commentary I’m just making sure
we identify what you’re both
doing

il

MURROW FRIENDLY
We all editorialize Frank Were giving them the
it’s just to what degree information up front and
I‘m aware that Fred asking them to explain
hold on Fred themselves
MURROW

Frank I’ve searched my conscience
and I can’t for the life of me
find any justification for this

I simply cannot accept that there
are on every story two equal and
logical sides to an argument If
you call it editorializing then
call it that Theyll have equal
time to defend themselves

STANTON
It is editorializing Period You
understand the position youre
putting us in

FRIENDLY
Were all in it together if the
Senate or

STANTON

Do me this favor Fred and avoid
any speeches about how were all
in a big boat together please
dont insult me I have to go
back to Mr Paley and to Alcoa
who sponsors your show and also
happens to have military
contracts and tell them they
might be caught in a tough bind
because of a beef you had with Joe
McCarthy

MURROW
We’re not going at McCarthy

STANTON
Youre starting the goddamn
fire I know what this is Ed
MURROW
When Bill and ft talked about this

you - and this goes back to “Hear
Tt Now’ you agreed that
corporate would have no influence
on news content

( ) STANTON
What I’m saying is - Don’t try to
con me into thinking that this is
good for me just do me that
courtesy

A knock on the door and NATALIE Friendly’s secretary
pokes her head in

FRIENDLY
Colonel with all due respect you
have been invited to participate
in this piece net to approve
this plece Were going with the
story that says that the US Air
Force tried Milo Radulovich
without one shred of evidence and
found him quilty of being a
seourity risk without the
Constitutional right to

ANDERSON
And you who also have not seen
the evidence are claiming he’s
not a security risk wouldn’t
you guess that the people who have
seen the contents of that envelope
might know a little more about
what makes someone a danger to his
country or do you think it
should just be you that
decides

FRIENDLY
Who are these “people” Are
they elected appointed Do
they have an axe to grind Is
it you sir or Colonel Jenkins
Do you know the contents of that
sealed envelope

They sit there very still

JENKINS
Mr Friendly We have been a
friend and an ally of both Mr

INT EDITING ROOM

Tight on a monitor Milo Radulovich’s lawyer is talking
(This will be the real footage) Beneath him on the
screen the subtitles read October 20 1953

LAWYER
The Air Force did not produce a
single witness we were not told
who the accusers were We had no
right to confront them or cross
examine them But at the
conclusion of the trial although
we had met the allegations the
Aix Force made findings at the
conclusion of the hearing that
every single allegation was true
As a matter of fact we have had no
hearing at all we have had no day
in court In all the thirty-two
years that I have been a
practicing attorney in Detroit I
have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice as this
thing has developed

The subtitles fade the image stops and begins to run
backwards

Good evening A few weeks ago

Lieut nt in the Air Force

MURROW (CONT‘D)
And also something about Air
Force regulation thirty five dash
sixty two That is a regulation
which states that a man may be
regarded as a security risk if he
has close and continuing
association with communists or
people believed to have communist
sympathies Lt Radulovich was
asked to resign in August He
declined

As MURROW continues his intro FRIENDLY on his back
slides up tc Murrow’s desk with a card that reads Milo
plece 240

MURROW (CONT’D
A board was called and heard his
case at the end it ¥
recommended that he be severed
from the Air Force although it
was also stated that there was no
question whatsoever as to the
Lieutenants leyalty We propose
to examine in so far as we can

WERSHBA
I guess a lot of people must have
asked you from time to time
wouldn’t it have been a lot easier
for you if you’d a well just
sort of kept quiet about the whole
thing maybe resigned and
nobody would have known anything
about it and all this trouble
wouldn’t have come to you

MILO
Well yes thats right I could
have signed a resignation which
was titled A Resignation in Lieu
of Elimination from the Service”
and thie would have given me an
honorable discharge However the
honorable discharge would have
stipulated that I have been
discharged because the Air Force
could not trust me In other
words I had been discharged as a
security risk

WERSHBA
What happens to your two children
That is your five year old and
your tive month old in terms of
you

MILO

Yes If I am being judged on my
relatives are my children going
to be asked to uh cenounce

TF on the Soviet payroll in 1934

WERSHBA
You want to know why that’s not

We start on Shirley as she brushes her hair in the vanity
mirror Joe dresses behind her

As Joe tells the story we stay on the worried face of
Shirley

WERSHBA
My argument was that if you just
show the images of McCarthy then
it wont make any difference If
you agree with him youll hate the
piece and if you don’t youll
love it

SHIRLEY
Maybe they should wait till they
get more footage

WERSHBA
Y don’t think we can take the
chance We have to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed

SHIRLEY
They haven‘’t gone after the Alsops
or Herb Block

WERSHBA

work for the Institute of

Then I guess it’s time

She turns and looks at him to help him tie his tie

Worried

SHIRLEY
I didn’t think I was I don’t
know why I was in the office on
Friday I answered the phone and
it was Howard calling from London
He asked me what was going on with
McCarthy and before I answered
him I turned and looked over my
shoulder to see who was listening

She finishes with his tie and gives him a kiss

WERSHBA
And who was listening

SHIRLEY
Chairman Mao

They both smile

WERSHBA
I’ll see you at work

We stay on Shirley as she sits back down and looks at

herself in the mirror

INT CONTROL ROOM

The show is already underway you could cut the tension
with a knife MURROW continues his pre-recorded

introduction on the monitor

MURROW (VO)
Because a report on Senator
McCarthy is by definition
controversial we want to say
exactly what we mean to say and
request your permission to read
from a script whatever remarks
Murrow and Friendly may make

MURROW (CONT’D)
If the Senator feels that we have
done violence to his words or
pictures and desires so to speak
to answer himself an opportunity
will be afforded him on this
program Our working thesis
tonight is this quotation “If
this fight against Communism has
made a fight between America’s two
great political parties the
American people know that one of
these parties will be destroyed

HEWITT
Ready two

The phone rings he answers

CUT TO

We now see

HEWITT (CONT’D)

No this is not the eleven o’clock
news try forty-four -- Operator I
tell you every week to shut off
these phones Now please no
calls ‘til eleven

MURROW (CONT’D)
And the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one party
system” We applaud that
statement and we think Senator
McCarthy ought to He said it
seventeen months ago in Milwaukee

HEWITT
Take two roll film

McCarthy on camera

MCCARTHY
The American people realize that
this cannot be a fight between
America’s two great political
parties If this fight against
communism is made a fight against
America’s two great political
parties the American people know
that one of those parties will be
destroyed and the Republic can’t
endure very long as a one party
system

INT PALEY’S OFFICE

PALEY sits watching by himself

MURROW
On one thing the Senator had been
consistent Often operating as a
one man committee he has traveled
far interviewed many terrorized
some accused civilian and
military leaders of the past
administration of a great
conspiracy to turn over the
country to communism

INT “SEE IT NOW’ SET

MURROW is seated in his chair On the monitors is

McCarthy

MCCARTHY
Well may I say that I was
extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens told two
Army officers that they had to
take part in the cover up of those
who promoted and coddled
communists As I read this
statement I thought of that
quotation “On what meat doth this
our Caesar feed”

INT STAGE 44

DON HOLLENBECK sits at the news desk watching a monitor

with great pride

On the monitor is more footage of the REED HARRIS

hearing

SENATOR MCCLELLAN
Do you think this book that you
wrote then did considerable harm
It’s publication might have an
adverse effect on the public by an
expression of the views contained
in it

HARRIS
The sale of that book was so
abysmally small it was so
unsuccessful that the question of
its influence uh really you can
go back to the publisher you’ll
see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books ever put out
He’s still sorry about it just as
I am

SENATOR MCCLELLAN
Well I think that’s a compliment
to American intelligence

INT JOE and SHIRLEY WERSHBAS NY APT

Shirley watches on the TV

MURROW
The Reed Harris hearing
demonstrates one of the Senators
techniques Twice he said “The
American Civil Liberties Union was
listed as a subversive front”
The Attorney General’s list does
not and never has listed the ACLU
as subversive nor does the FBI
or any other federal government
agency And the ACLU holds in
it’s files letters of
commendation from President
Truman President Eisenhower and
General MacArthur

The rest of MURROW’S speech will be intercut with close-
ups of all our players Sitting silently at home in the
control room the newsroom Paleys office at home with
Shirley Wershba

MURROW (CONTD)
Earlier the Senator asked “Upon
what meat does this our Caesar
feed” Had he looked three lines
earlier in Shakespeares “Caesar”
he would have found this line
which is not altogether
inappropriate “The fault dear
Brutus is not in our stars but in
ourselves” No one familiar with
the history of this country can
deny that congressional committees
are useful It is necessary to
investigate before legislating
but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine
one and the Junior Senator from
Wisconsin has stepped over it
repeatedly We must not confuse
dissent with disloyalty We must
remember always that accusation is
not proof and that conviction
depends upon evidence and due
process of law We will not be
driven by fear into an age of
unreason if we dig deep in our
history and our doctrine and
remember that we are not descended
from fearful men not from men who
feared to write to speak to
associate and to defend the causes
that were for the moment
unpopular

(MORE)
(

MURROW (CONTD)
We proclaim ourselves as indeed we
are the defenders of freedom
wherever it continues to exist in
the world but we cannot defend
freedom abroad by deserting it at
home The actions of the Junior
Senator from Wisconsin have caused
alarm and dismay amongst our
allies abroad and given
considerable comfort to our
enemies And whose fault is
that Not really his He didn’t
create this situation of fear he
merely exploited it and rather
successfully Cassius was right
“The fault dear Brutus is not in
our stars but in ourselves” Good
night And Good luck

Jack Gould Gould
SHIRLEY

Edward R Murrow’s television
program on Senator Joseph R
McCarthy was an exciting and
provocative examination of the man
and his methods It was crusading
journalism of high responsibility
and courage For TV so often
plagued by timidity and
hesitation the program was a
milestone that reflected
enlightened citizenship”

They all cheer

FRIENDLY
He didn’t like it
MURROW
Yeah whats this guy‘s beef
SHIRLEY
Hold on ’The program was no

less a indictment of those who
wish the problems posed by the
senators tactics and theatrics
would just go away and leave them
alone That was Mr Murrow’s and
television’s triumph and a very
great one”

They all cheer

He looks through the papers until he finds it and hands
it to Shirley

SHIRLEY
Hang on OK Jack OBrian

Shirley reads from the paper

SHIRLEY
“We can’t say we were surprised at
Edward R Murrow’s ‘Hate McCarthy’
telecast last evening When his
explosively one sided propaganda
edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy’s March
against Communism was finished
last evening by equally
Machiavellian coincidence the
following telecast featured
Murrow’s “PM” protege Hollenbeck
In an obviously gloating mood
Hollenbeck hoped viewers had
witnessed his patrons triumph from
and for the left”

The room is getting quieter the mood much less jubilant
Everyone is aware of the Hollenbeck attacks

SHIRLEY WERSHBA
eand so on and so on I guess O’Brian doesn’t
like scotch

HOLLENBECK
It‘s OK Shirley finish it
SHIRLEY FRIENDLY
That’s it it’s just Shirley read the Post
HOLLENBECK

SHIRLEY WERSHBA

Don stares at her until she gives in

SHIRLEY
Ah OK it says “The Columbia
Broadcasting System has been in a
lengthy “clean house of lefties”
mood The worst offenders on
lesser levels have been quietly
pushed out of the company Don
Hollenbeck a graduate of the
demised pinko publication “PM”
attacked conservative newspapers
with sly and slanted propaganda
he then proceeded through an
equally tilted review of the day’s

speech

EISENHOWER
In this country if someone
dislikes you or accuses you he
must come up in front He cannot
hide behind the shadows he cannot
assassinate you or your character
from behind without suffering the
penalties of an outraged
citizenry If we are going to
continue to be proud that we‘re
Americans there must be no
weakening of the code by which we
have lived By the right to meet
your accuser face to face by your
right to go to the church or the
synagogue or even the mosque of
your choice

ROY COHN
I have no further questions of
this witness at this time
(MORE)

ROY COHN (CONTD)
I can say this we have the
testimony of Miss Markward the
undercover agent for the FBI
stating that Annie Lee was was a
member a dues-paying member of
the Communist Party uh the
Northeast Club of the Communist
Party We have corroboration of
that testimony by another witness
who was called before the
committee and gave their sworn
statement to the effect that she
also knew Mrs Moss as a member of
the Northeast Club of the
Communist Party

SENATOR MCCLELLAN
Well Mr Chairman I’d like to
make were making a statement
here against a witness who has
come and submitted to cross-
examination Now she’s already
lost her job Shes been
suspended because of this action
I’m not defending her If she’s a
Communist I want her exposed
But to make these statements as
weve corroborating evidence that
she is a Communist Under these
circumstances I think she’s
entitled to have it produced here
in her presence and let the public
know about it and let her know
about it

There is applause

SENATOR MCCLELLAN (CONT’D)
I don’t like to try people by
hearsay evidence

More applause

WE ARE NOW OUT ON THE STREET LOOKING AT TELEVISIONS IN A

SENATOR MCCLELLAN (CONT ’D)
Id like to get the witnesses here
and try ‘em-- by testimony under

CHAIRMAN MUNDT
The uh chair will rule that the
comment of Mr Cohn be stricken
from the record

SENATOR MCCLELLAN
Well I didn’t ask that I didnt
ask that Mr Chairman

WE ARE NOW IN THE PENTAGON BAR AS PATRONS WATCH THE
TELEVISION

CHAIRMAN MUNDT
- executive session whether we
should try to uh produce a
witness in public because the FBI
may have her undercover and we
don’t want to uh-

SENATOR MCCLELLAN
You can’t strike these statements
made by counsel here as to
evidence that we’re having and
withholding You cannot strike
that from the press nor from the
public mind once it’s planted
there That’s the that is the
uh the evil of it And I don’t
think it’s fair to a witness to a
citizen of this country to bring
‘em up here and cross-examine ‘em
Then when they get through say
“Weve got something the FBI has
got something on you that condemns
you” It is not sworn testimony
it’s convicting people by rumor
and hearsay and innuendo

MURROW
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R
McCarthy We labeled it as
controversial Most of that
report consisted of words and
pictures of the Senator At that
time we said if the Senator
believes we have done violence to
his words or pictures if he
desires to speak to answer
himself an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program The
Senator sought the opportunity
asked for a delay of three weeks
because he said he was very busy
and he wished adequate time to
prepare his reply We agreed We
placed no restrictions on the
manner or method of the
presentation of his reply and we
suggested that we would not take
time to comment on this program
Here now is Senator Joseph R
McCarthy Junior Senator from
Wisconsin

McCarthy begins As he delivers his rebuttal we will cut
to various places that it is airing

For the moment we’‘re right on MURROW as he watches

MCCARTHY
Good evening Mr Edward R
Murrow Educational Director of
the Columbia Broadcasting System
devoted his program to an attack
on the work of the United States

on me personally as its Chairman
Now over the past four years he
has made repeated attacks upon me
and those fighting communists

Now ordinarily I wouldnt take
time out of the important work at

cleverest of the jackal pack which
is always found at the throat of
anyone who dares expose individual
communists and traitors

MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
I am compelled by the fact to say
to you that Mr Edward R Murrow
as far back as twenty years ago
was engaged in propaganda for
communist causes For example
the Institute for International
Education of which he was the
Acting Director was chosen to act
as a representative by a Soviet
agency to do a job which would
normally be done by the Russian
Secret Police

We are on the set of “See it Now” as MURROW addresses us

directly

MURROW
Last week Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program to
correct any errors he might have
thought we made in our report of
March 9th Since he made no
reference to any statements of
fact that we made we must
conclude that he found no errors
of fact He proved again that
anyone who exposes him anyone who
does not share his hysterical
disregard to decency and human
dignity and the rights guaranteed
by the Constitution must be either
a Communist or a fellow traveler
I fully expected this treatment
The Senator added this reporters
name to a long list of individuals
and institutions he has accused of
serving the communist cause His
proposition is very simple
Anyone who criticizes or opposes
McCarthy’s methods must be a
Communist And if that be true
there are an awful lot of
communists in this country For
the record lets consider briefly
some of the Senator’s charges He
claimed but offered no proof that
I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World
That is false

who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles as a
pre-condition for conversation or
friendship I do not agree with
his political ideas Laski as he
makes clear in the introduction

because of political agreement but

The problem isn’t simply that
youve lost your sponsor With
Alcoa See it Now” still loses

Ed I’ve got Tuesday night
programming that’s number one
People want to enjoy themselves
They dont want a civics lesson

MURROW
Well what do you want Bill

PALEY
I don’t want a constant stomach
ache every time you do a
controversial subject

MURROW
I’m afraid thats the price you
have to be willing to pay

PALEY
Careful Ed Let‘s walk carefully
through these next few moments

MURROW
But the content of what were
doing is more important than
what some guy in Cincinnati

PALEY
-What you‘re doing Ed Not me
Not Frank Stanton You

MURROW
CBS News” “See it Now” all
belong to you

PALEY
You wouldn’t know it

MURROW
Is it credit you want

sponsors and costs a third
of what you do

Pause

Silence

PALEY

I never censored a single program
I hold on to affiliates who wanted
entertainment from us I’ve fought
to keep our license with the same
politicians that you were bringing
down and I never said no to you
Never

MURROW
I would argue that we’ve done well
by one another I would argue
that this network is defined by
what the news department has
accomplished I would also argue
that never saying no is not the
same as “not censoring”

PALEY
Really Well you should teach
journalism You and Mr
Friendly

PALEY (CONT’D)
Let me ask you this Why didn’t
you correct McCarthy when he said
that Alger Hiss had been convicted
of treason He was only convicted
of perjury You corrected
everything else Did you not want
the appearance of defending a
known communist I would argue
that everyone censors including
you

MURROW
What do you want to do Bill

PALEY
I’m going to take your show from
half an hour to an hour But it
won’t be a weekly program And
it wont be Tuesday night

MURROW
When would it be

PALEY
Sunday afternoon

Silence

FRIENDLY

FRIENDLY

downfall of television

MURROW

FRIENDLY

MURROW

Senate they don’t kick him out

FRIENDLY

lesson

This sits with the two old friends
They start to walk to the elevators

FRIENDLY
Well we might as well go down
swinging Well do the story
about the migrant farm workers

MURROW

America is Milton Berle

MURROW
Did everybody know

FRIENDLY
Pretty much

We pass a bank of monitors that start on Milton Berle
We pan to the next monitor and it’s Howdy Doody To the
next and its Kookla Fran and Ollie The next one is
Murrow giving the last of his “Box of Lights and Wires”
speech We move in on the monitor

MURROW
I began by saying that our history
will be what we make it If we go
on aS we are then history will
take its revenge and retribution
will not limp in catching up with
us

MURROW (CONTD)
Just once in a while let us exalt
the importance of ideas and
information Let us dream to the
extent of saying that on a given

Sunday night the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan is given
over to a clinical survey on the
state of American education anda
week or two later the time
normally used by Steve Allen is
devoted to a thouroughgoing study
of American policy in the Middle
East Would the corporate image
of their respective sponsors be
damaged Would the stockholders
rise up in their wrath and
complain Would anything happen
other than a few million people
would have received a little
illumination on subjects that may
well determine the future of this
country and therefore the future
of the corporations

INT CHICAGO THEATER

oo Back on our original set

MURROW (CONTD)

To those who say people wouldn’t
look they wouldn’t be interested
they’re too complacent
indifferent and insulated I can
only reply- there is in one
reporter’s opinion considerable
evidence against that contention
But even if they are right what
have they got to lose Because if
they are right and this
instrument is good for nothing but
to entertain amuse and insulate
then the tube is flickering now
and we will soon see that the
whole struggle is lost

curT TO

INT CBS CORRIDOR

We cut back to the monitors As Murrow finishes we pan
around to other monitors Watching the history of TV

Kennedy being shot

John John’s salute

Vietnam

Man landing on the moon

Lucille Ball

Archie Bunker

Watergate

Laugh-In

Carter with Begin and Sadat

Springer as people are throwing chairs and chanting
“Jerry”
MURROW VO (CONTD
This instrument can teach it can
illuminate yes and it can even
inspire But it can do so only to
the extent that humans are
determined to use it to those ends
We freeze on the frame as we see a fistfight break out

MURROW VO (CONTD)
Otherwise it is merely wires and
lights in a box

We fade to black
