GREEN MILE

Screenplay by Frank Darabont
from the novel by Stephen King

First Draft

We each owe a death there are no exceptions

A SONG BEGINS distant as a faded memory on an old

Once I built a railroad made it run Made it race
timeOnce I built a railroad now its doneBrother
you spare a dime

Opening credit sequence

plays against footage of the Great Depression images
haunting and sepia-toned defining an era The bread
linesthe soup kitchensthe dust bowl refugees

west with their possessions on their backs and no hope
their eyesthe strutting gangster royalty flaunting
bootleg richesan entire generation of lost youth

the rialsthe US army troops raining truncheon blows
the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One
Hooverville is set afire in the very shadow of the
capitol

All these faces all these lives in a world not really
very long ago

He pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to
nibble as he presses up on the ridge

Low angle nursing home and ridge beyond

and we see Paul from a distance just a speck

toward the treeline A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame
parks a bumper sticker looming large I Have Seen God

He slams the door and heads for the nursing home
EXT WOODS - MORNING

aS CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul
wandering a wooded path munching a tidbit of toast

for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic

Its silent here like a church The only sounds we hear

the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the
woodpecker

A RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze He turns becomes
transfixed Softly

PAUL
Oh my

Reverse angle

reveals a magnificent BUCK not twenty feet away misty
breath punching the cold morning air They watch each

other

for an endless moment both standing stock still

and then the animal bounds away vanishing into the

foliage Paul lets out a breath shakes his head in
wonder

He takes another bite of toast moves on

and WE PAN WITH HIM to reveal a pair of old wooden

Brads eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesnt mind
abusing
the elderly as long as he doesnt get caught doing it

They hear the truck HONKING as it rumbles up outside
gives them a nod to resume their positions Paul walks
the Mile passing the cells where two inmates reside--
first is ARLEN BITTERBUCK a Washita Cherokee the
EDUARD DELACROIX (DEL) a skinny Cajun

DEL
New boy coming in boss

PAUL
Never you mind Del you just keep
your nose quietly on your business

Paul arrives at the end of the Mile takes up a position

an empty cell (Down at this end past the cells is E
Blocks version of the hole -- a padded room where

inmates are sent to cool off It isnt used very
fact at the moment its doubling as storage space)
Brutal

BRUTAL

BRUTAL
Paul You might wanna reconsider

PAUL

PAUL
Cant be bigger than you
Brutal tosses him a look--just wait He swings the door
open
in a hot flood of daylight giving us our first good
look at
John coffey
is a huge black man nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds
his
massive head shiny and bald his skin a tapestry of old
scars his prison overalls (the biggest size they had)
ending
at mid-calf He looks dull and confused as if wondering
where he is and how he got there Percy and Harry lead
him

toward E Block in shackles Percys got his hickory
baton out

then Coffey enters ducking low to get through his
blotting out Brutal and Dean as his massive frame fills

door Everything hangs suspended for a moment a look of
hold shit written on everybodys faces Percy keeps

on the big mans cuffs leading him along with a cry of

PERCY
Dead man walking Dead man--

PAUL
Percy thats enough

Percy falls reproachfully silent Paul doesnt dignify
just motions for them to come on The procession comes
the Mile with Brutal and Dean bringing up rear
BRUTAL
You sure you wanna be in there
with him
PAUL
(looks to Coffey)
Am I gonna have trouble with you
big boy

Coffey shakes his head slowly Paul takes the clipboard
transfer papers from Harry turns and enters the cell

Coffey just stands outside the cell and waits as if he
doesnt understand the concept Paul motions him to come

in Coffey starts to comply but Percy raps him smartly
the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster

Coffey flinches enters the cell Paul stares angrily at
Percy who stands slapping his hickory baton against the
of his hand like a man with a toy hes itching to use

PAUL
Percy Theyre moving house over
in the infirmary Why dont you go
see if they could use some help

PERCY
They got all the men they need

PAUL
Why dont you just go make sure
(off his look)
I dont care where you go Percy
as long as its not here at this
very moment

Percy flushes red the baton hovering near his palm He

looks

like hes about to say something but thinks better of
it and

stalks angrily up the Mile instead

and sees Del at his bars smiling Infuriated Percy

swings his baton and smashes Dels fingers with a LOUD
CRACK

Del jerks back howling in pain

DEL
OWW GOD HE BUS MY FINGERS

PERCY
Wiped that grin off your shitpoke
face didnt I

PAUL
Goddamn it Percy Get the hell
off my block

Percy throws Paul a look of disdain--your block huh He
swaggers out Dels on his knees weeping from the pain

DEL
Oww damn boss he done bus my
fingers for true

PAUL
Well get it looked at Del now
keep yourself quiet like I said

Del falls silent moaning over his hand Paul turns to
Coffey who looks unsettled by all the commotion
PAUL
If I let Harry take those chains
off you you gonna be nice

Coffey nods Harry enters to remove Coffeys shackles

PAUL
Your name is John Coffey

COFFEY
(deep and quiet)
Yes sir boss like the drink

Coffey shakes his head Harry steps out

PAUL

COFFEY
Do you leave a light on after

Paul blinks Its the last thing he expected Coffey
uneasily as if they might think him foolish for asking
COFFEY
Because I get a little scared in
the dark sometimes If its a
strange place
Paul looks to his men The guards are trading glances
PAUL
Its pretty bright in here all
night long We keep half the

lights burning in the corridor

COFFEY
Corder

Coffey looks confused Paul points to the lights lining
ceiling of the Green Mile in wire mesh cages

PAUL
Right out there

Coffey nods relieved Then he surprises everybody by
offering Paul his hand as if to show proper manners

hesitates oddly touched then surprised his men even
accepting Coffeys hand swallows his Coffey shakes
lets go

Paul steps from the cell Brutal slides the door shut

it Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do then
sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his

He looks up at Paul his voice soft as a whisper
COFFEY
Couldnt help it boss I tried to
take it back but it was too late

Paul turns leads his men up the Mile
PAULS INNER OFFICE

and they enter a few moments later Paul is furious
but
keeping a lid on his temper

PAUL
Dean run Delacroix up to the
infirmary and see if his fingers
are broken

BRUTAL
Course theyre broken I heard the
damn bones crack Goddamn Percy

HARRY
You hear what he was yelling when
we brought the big dummy in

PAUL
How could I miss it Harry The

This makes Brutal snort breaking the tension--the
others

Curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of

puffing smoke across the landscape

Paul and Dean look again and this time they see it
A tiny brown mouse is coming up the Mile It trots a
distance peers right and left as if checking the

inmates in their cells then makes another forward

PAUL
Hes doing a cell check

This gets them all trying not to laugh The mouse draws
closer Dean starts to look worried

DEAN
It aint normal for a mouse to
come up on people that way Maybe
its rabid

BRUTAL
Oh my Christ The big mouse
expert The Mouse Man You see it
foaming at the mouth Mouse Man

DEAN
(dubious)
I dont see its mouth at all

That does it--Paul and Brutal burst out laughing The
stops before them and peers up curling its tail primly

around its paws as if to wait The guards fall silent
fascinated Bitterbuck stirs in his cell sits up to

You know hes gonna be chewing the
padding out of walls and making
himself a nice little nest

Brutal give Paul a sheepish look--well Paul sighs

INT E BLOCK - DAY

A low static shot Green floor stretching before us

Harry

and Bill Dodge are at the desk bg doing paperwork and

filing chores Percy is idling nearby whistling softly
and

combing his hair

and into this quiet shot deep in foreground creeps
the

mouse He starts walking the Mile as before

right toward Percy

COFFEY

stares through his bars as the mouse goes by

PERCY

keeps combing his hair unaware

DEL

sits quietly picking his nose in his cell The mouse
appears

outside the bars cruising inexorably up the Mile Del
turns

slowly watches the mouse go by

PERCY

still grooming himself still unaware

keeps coming closer ANGLE UP to Bitterbuck peering
through

his bars watching him go by

PERCY
TINY

the

The

keeps working that comb--and freezes at the sound of a
SQUEAK His head swivels slowly

and theres the mouse Staring at him

That moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than
itself If mice have a natural enemy Percy is it

PAUL
You little son of a bitch

Harry and Bill glance up from their work

HARRY
Well Ill be damned There he is
big as Billy-be-frigged I thought
Brutal was pulling my leg

BILL
Thats a goddamn mouse

HARRY
Yeah Brute said he was in here
last night begging for food came
right up to the desk

BILL
My ass Give him some room Percy
see what he does
Percy takes a few careful steps back eyes never leaving
mouse (Percys hand starts easing toward the handle of
baton) The mouse comes up to the desk as before
HARRY
Brave little bastard gotta give
him that
Harry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it
mouse picks it up starts to eat (Percys hand inches

closer to his baton)

BILL
Here lemme try

Bill drops a piece of cracker The mouse ignores it
completely keeping its beady little eyes on Harry

(Percys
hand starts easing his baton from its holster)
BILL
Maybe hes full
HARRY
(grins)
Maybe he knows youre just a
floater Gotta be an E Block
regular to feed the E Block mouse
doncha know
Harry drops another piece--and sure enough the mouse
starts
to eat Harrys smile fades He and Bill trade a look
HARRY
I was just kidding ab--
Percy lets rip a BELLOWING WAR CRY (Yaaaahhh) and
launches
his baton like a spear scaring the crap out of
everyone
The mouse ducks (yes actually ducks) and the baton sail
over
his head close enough to ruffle its fur bouncing off
the
floor Apparently remembering a pressing engagement
elsewhere the mouse takes off in a flash toward the
restraint room
Percy roars with frustration and takes off after it
trying
to squash it with his heavy work shoes leaping and
stomping
with great big galloping strides missing the mouse by
inches
and thus is the Green Mile traversed with Percy
stomping
and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer the
convicts
yelling at their bars the mouse zigging and zagging
like Jim

Thorpe heading for the endzone

The mouse wins zipping to safety under the restraint
room

Harry points Percys down at the far end rummaging
in the restraint room tossing shit out onto the Mile

Percy keeps scanning the restraint room The others all

He cocks a thumb at the inmates in their cells

PERCY
So what They arent in cradle-

BRUTAL
We dont scare em any more than

PAUL
Men under strain can snap Hurt
themselves Hurt others Thats
why our job is talking not
yelling Youll do better to think
of this place like an intensive

PERCY
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in Thats all

Anybody doesnt like it can kiss

Brutal steps forward wanting to slug the little
bastard
Percy shies back but keeps his bravado up

PERCY

pain holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a
moan Its so bad he actually lays down on the Mile

pressed against the cool linoleum wishing he were dead
stretch of silenceand then

to shake the sensation off comes a little closer

DEL

His hand shoots out grabs Paul by the collar jerks him
close Paul makes a panic-grab for his revolver

but Coffey lays his free hand atop Pauls eases his
from the gun--no need for that Coffeys hand then
slowly down easing to Pauls crotch
PAUL

back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a

energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffeys hand

gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his

PAUL

Paul fumbles his keys to the lock unsure if he should
the door watching the big mans contortions grow

like a cat trying to cough up a hairball

and then comes an unpleasant gaggingretching sound
Coffeys lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of
sneerand he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny
insects They swirl furiously in front of his face turn

whiteand disappear Paul just stares stunned

PAUL

and steps back into the toilet Not trusting this
situation for even a moment Paul opens his fly takes a
deep
breath to prepare himself for the pain starts to pee
and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the
bowl
The look on Pauls face says it all--blessed relief

EXT ROAD TO TEFTON - DAY

Pauls model T comes putt-putting up the road past a

sign

Trapingus County Welcomes You

EXT HOUSE IN TEFTON - BACK PORCH - DAY

BURT HAMMERSMITH public defender for Trapingus County
sits

with a cold soda and a magazine watching his TWO
CHILDREN

playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard The
screen

door opens and CYNTHIA HAMMERSMITH ushers Paul out

CYNTHIA
I offer you a cold drink

PAUL
Yes maam a cold drink would be
fine Thank you

She goes back inside Burt rises

PAUL
Mr Hammersmith Your office said
d find you at home today I hope
m not troubling you

BURT
That depends Mr--

PAUL
Paul Edgecomb Im the E Block
superintendant at Cold Mountain

BURT
The Green Mile Ive heard of it
Lost a few clients your way

fq

PAUL
Thats why Im here Id like to
ask you about one of them

Burt settles back down motions please sit

BURT
Which client Now you got my
curiosity aroused

PAUL
John Coffey

BURT
Ah Coffey He causing you
problems

PAUL

No cant say he is He doesnt
like the dark He cries on
occasion Other than that

BURT
Cries does he Well hes got a
lot to cry about Id say You
know what he did

PAUL
(nods)
I read the court transcripts

Cynthia reappears hands Paul a cold root beer

PAUL
Thank you Missus

CYNTHIA
My pleasure Kids Lunch is about
ready Yall come on up

She goes back inside but the kids arent quite able to
tear
themselves away from their play

BURT
What exactly are you trying to
find out Satisfy my curiosity
Ill see if I can satisfy yours

PAUL
Ive wondered if he ever did
anything like that before

BURT
Why Has he said anything

PAUL
No But a man who does a thing
like that has often developed a
taste for it over time Occurred
to me it might be easy enough to
follow his backtrail and find out
A man his size and colored to
boot cant be that hard to trace

BURT
Youd think so but youd be
wrong Believe me we tried Its
like he dropped out of the sky

PAUL
How do you explain that

BURT
Were in a Depression A third of
the countrys out of work

People are drifting by the
thousands looking for work
looking for that greener grass
Even a giant like Coffey wouldnt
get noticed everywhere he goes
not until he kills a couple of
little girls

PAUL
Hesstrange I admit But there
doesnt seem to be any real
violence in him I know violent
men Mr Hammersmith I deal with
em day in and day out

Burt smiles realizing

BURT
You didnt come up here to ask me
whether he might have killed
before You came up here to see if
I think he did it at all Thats
it isnt it

PAUL
Do you

BURT
One seldom sees a less ambiguous
case He was found with the
victims in his arms Blurted out
a confession right then and there

PAUL
Yet you defended him

BURT
Everyone is entitled to a defense
Cynthia hollers from an open window

CYNTHIA
Kids Lunch

BURT
Yall listen to your Momma now

The kids start this way Burt turns back to Paul

BURT
Tell you something You listen
close too because it might be
something you need to know

PAUL
Im listening

BURT

We had us a dog No particular
breed but gentle Ready to lick
your hand or fetch a stick Just
a sweet mongrel you know the kind

(Paul nods)
In many way a good mongrel dog is
like you negro You get to know
it and often you get to love it
It is of no particular use but
you keep it around because you
think it loves you If youre
lucky Mr Edgecomb you never
have to find out any different My
wife and I were not so lucky
Caleb Come here for a second

The little boy comes to him staring at his feet Burt

tires
to raise the boys chin The boy resists for a moment
BURT
Please son
and then his face comes around Hes horribly scarred
on

that side the eye missing

BURT
He has the one eye I suppose hes
lucky not to be blind We get down
on our knees and thank God for
that much at least Right Caleb
(the boy nods shyly)
Okay go on in now

The boy races inside after his sister Paul follows
Burts

gaze off toward the rear of the property where an
unoccupied

doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds

BURT
That dog attacked my boy for no
reason Just got it into his mind
one day Same with John Coffey He
was sorry afterwards of that I
have no doubtbut those little
girls stayed raped and murdered
nonetheless Maybe hes never done
it before--my dog never bit
before but I didnt concern
myself with that I went out there
with my rifle and grabbed his
collar and blew his brains out

PAUL
Im sorry for your trouble

Burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod

BURT

Im as enlightened as the next
man Mr Edgecomb I would not
bring back slavery for all the tea
in China I believe we have to be
humane and generous in our efforts
to solve the race problem But we
have to remember that the negro
will bite if he gets the chance
just like a mongrel dog will bite
if it crosses its mind to do so

(beat)
Is Coffey guilty Yes he is
Dont you doubt it and dont you
turn your back on him You might
get away with it once or even a
hundred timesbut in the end

He raises his hand making biting motions with his
fingers

BURT
You understand
Paul says nothing Burt gazes out again Softly
BURT
Im gonna have to tear that old
doghouse down one of these days

Del tosses the spool extra hard--it takes a bad bounce
the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the

The mouse goes after it like a shot too intent to

His old enemy Percy

BRUTAL
Percy no

Percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on Mr
Jingles Theres a SOFT SNAP as the mouses back breaks

Del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars
the mouses name Percy looks to Brutal and Paul
PERCY

Knew Id get him sooner or later

Just a matter of time really
He turns and strolls up the Mile leaving Mr Jingles
in a tiny pool of blood Up at the duty desk Dean and
get up from a cribbage game stunned and furious
Percy strolls past exits to the execution chamber Del
still screaming all his pent-up terror and grief
at the dying mouse And then comes a soft urgent voice

COFFEY
Givem to me

They turn Coffeys got his arms out through his bars

massive hand spread open
COFFEY
Givem to me Might still be time

Paul hesitates scoops the mouse up off the floor
wincing at
the feel of it Splintered bones are poking at the hide

BRUTAL
What are you doing

Paul doesnt answer just lays Mr Jingles into Coffeys
hand Coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and

lays his
other hand gently over it cupping the creature All we
see
now is the tail hanging out the side twitching weakly
BRUTAL
Paul what the hell--
Paul motions him quiet Del is pleading softly at his
bars
DEL
Please John Oh Johnny help him
please help him sil vous plait
Harry and Dean join the group Everybody watching now
Coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands inhales
sharply
The world hangs suspended for a moment Coffey raises
his
face contorting as if desperately ill starts making
those
horrendous choking sounds in his throat
BRUTAL
(softly)
Oh dear Jesus The tail Look at
the tail
They do The tail is no longer weak and dying Its
snapping
briskly back and forth as if ready to play
Coffey makes that retchinggagging soundand again
exhales
a cloud of swirling black insects from his nose and
mouth

The men watch speechless as the bugs turn white and
disappear

Coffey bends down opens his hand Mr Jingles bounds

off his
fingers through the bars racing past the guards feet
They
turn to see Del gather the mouse up laughing and
crying
Dean turns back to Coffey with a stunned whisper
DEAN

wall

Nothing they can do Paul nods to Harry who takes the
mask from the back of the chair and rolls it down over
head leaving the top of his shaved head exposed
PERCY
takes the sponge and bends down to the bucket of brine
other dont see it but we do
Percy only pretends to dip the sponge and soak it It
touches the water He straightens up and places the
atop Delacroixs head hiding it with his hands
The cap is lowered Paul and the others havent yet

TIGHT ON PAUL
as realization starts to dawn He stares at the bucket
across the floor to Delacroix coming to terms with the
evidence of his eyes--theres no water on the floor or

Paul a horrified look Paul responds with a harsh

PAUL

Delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair
masked face snapping violently from side to side his
pistoning up and down in his restraints
Theres a MUFFLED POP from under the cap like a pine
exploding in a hot fire Smoke starts coming through the
fabric of the mask puffing upward Del is being cooked
alive Paul spins to the partition hollering--

PAUL

BRUTAL

Dont you tell him to stop Dont

Paul turns back helpless The other guards are trading
looks unable to believe whats happening Even Percy
aghast--he was expecting something but not this

PAUL

The cell is unlocked Coffey emerges Paul motions them
along still grilling Dean
PAUL

DEAN
Youre over in Admin going over
Dels file Brutal and Harry are
in the laundry doing their wash--
A skinny white arm suddenly shoots out from Wild Bills
cell
and grabs Coffey by the wrist The men gasp shocked to
see

Billy on his feet grinning and weaving like a punch-
drunk
Coffeys reaction is beyond simple surprise hes
actually

trembling at Billys touch as if some electrical circuit
were

engaged His eyes are wide and horrified as if hed
just put

his hand in a basket full of snakes He tries to pull
away

but Billy has him tight that mysterious circuit
blazing

BILLY
(slurring wildly)
Where you fink youre goin

Coffey responds softly with utmost horror

COFFEY
Youre a bad man

BILLY
Sright nigger Bad as youd want

Paul plucks Billys hand off Coffeys arm--and Coffey
flinches back as the circuit is broken

BILLY
Whooeee Whole rooms spinning
Like Im shit-ass drunk I have me
some shine or what

He turns and staggers back to his bunk muttering all
the way

BILLY
Niggers oughtta have they own
lectric chair White man oughtnt
havta sit in no nigger lectric
chair nossir

He goes face-first onto his bunk Coffey is still
staring

COFFEY
Hes a bad man

INT EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
Coffey is brought inand freezes in horror at the

sight of
Old Sparky A whisper
COFFEY
Theyre still in there Pieces of
them still in there I hear them
screaming

All eyes go to the electric chair It sits shrouded in
shadow

like an ominous throne Never before has this place felt
so

haunted to the men It makes the hairs on the neck stand
up

PAUL
John come along Right now
yhear Cmon Toward that door

Coffey finally responds pulling away
INT E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

and they come down the steps They realize Coffey
will

have to stoop all the way down the tunnel Paul pats the

gurney

PAUL
Lie down on this
(off Coffeys look)
Itll be easier for you and no
harder for us

Coffey eases carefully onto the gurney lying on his
back
His knees hang over the edge and his toes touch the
ground

but it works They push him along traversing the pools
of
light

Coffey actually starts to smile He reaches out his
arms
fingertips touching the tunnel walls as they go by

COFFEY
Say This is fun

EXT PRISON WALL - NIGHT

WIDE SHOT OF PRISON

dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see
Four dark figures detach from the shadows hurrying

Coffeys hand scoops up some fallen leaves TILT UP to

How far is it

HARRY
Just up ahead

Harry brings them to a thicket of trees They start
branches and boughs uncovering a battered old FARMALL
hidden in the brush
The men pause Even more fireflies are swirling around
growing in number Its getting downright weird
Coffey laughs softly drawing their attention A
smile has utterly transformed his face He raises his
letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his
COFFEY
Hey there little firefly Wheres
Mrs Firefly this evening

Another firefly joins the first both now dancing and
blinking around his fingers Coffey laughs again

COFFEY
Oh there you is You come out to
play too
The men stand gaping The fireflies are flitting to
if to a beacon He waves his hands slowly fireflies
and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust

They begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny

planet orbiting a sun their light kicking a mellow
his ebony skin Coffeys eyes meet Pauls

PAUL

COFFEY
I love em is why They dont
think no hurtful thoughts Theys

Harry gets in behind the wheel jabs the starter

Headlights come over the rise The truck appears
down toward the house The world is isolated and still
IN THE TRUCK CAB
Harry stops and cuts the engine leaving the headlights
Silence now save for the trilling of crickets
IN THE STAKEBED
Paul and Brutal both look terrified now that theyre
here An urgent whisper

BRUTAL
We can still turn back

Paul hesitates wanting to do just that but

COFFEY
Boss look Someones up

Lights are coming on inside the house Coffey rises and
down from the truck pulling Paul along Brutal follows
BRUTAL
This is a mistake Christ Paul

PAUL
Too late now Harry keep John

HAL

PAUL
Hal its us Its Paul and

The door swings wider revealing Hals face gaunt and
in the yellow porch light stunned to see them

HAL

PAUL
Hal Gods sakes take your finger
off the trigger
Hal doesnt aiming past them at the truck in the yard
HAL

Coffey steps into the glare of headlights with Harry
on his arm trying to hold him back Hal cocks both
HAL
John Coffey Halt Halt right

His aim wavers as a womans voice comes from upstairs
MELINDA (0S)
Hal Who are you talking to you

A frozen moment Hal mortified Paul gives him a look--
that Melinda
Hals shotgun shifts back to Coffey--but Paul steps in

of the muzzle

PAUL
No ones hurt Were here to help

HAL
Help what I dont understand Is
this a prison break

PAUL
I cant explain what it is You

Coffey comes up the steps brushes Paul aside stops

its
that benign hypnotic effect Coffey has

HAL

MELINDA
Hal Make them go away No
salesmen in the middle of the
night No Fuller brushes No
French knickers with come in the

fuck in a rolling dd

We hear the sound of GLASS BREAKING then she begins to
sob

COFFEY

Coffey pulls the shotgun gently from Hals grasp hands

Paul Coffey moves past Hal into the house

heading up toward that quavering voice

MELINDA (0S)
Stay out of here Whoever you are

visitors you rats asshole

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Coffey enters trailed by the others Paul pauses
The woman propped in bed barely resembles Melinda Moores
anymore--she looks made up like a Halloween witch her
skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles one corner of
mouth twisted Yellowish bile stains her chin and the
of her nightgown Her hair has gone white and straw-
eyes glowering at Coffey with lively irrational
MELINDA
Oh so big Pull down your pants
Lets have a look

Hal groans with despair Coffey just stands there for a
moment watching her from a distance then approaches

bed

MELINDA
Dont come near me pigfucker

but as he draws closer a change occurs Her features
soften her eyes become more sane and aware

MELINDA
Why do you have so many scars Who
hurt you so badly

COFFEY
Dont hardly remember maam

Coffey sits on the edge of the bed The lights seem to
eyes

The

moment

with an

lips

inhaling

moment as

hotter and brighter Tears are forming in Melindas
MELINDA
Whats your name
COFFEY
John Coffey maam Like the
drink only not spelt the same

She lays back staring at him with shining fascination

world seems to be slowing down growing very still

and he starts bending slowly toward her

COFFEY
Maam

MELINDA
Yes John Coffey

COFFEY
I see it I see it

He comes closercloser still
COFFEY

You be still now You be so quiet

and so still
He brushes her forehead with his lipsthe gentlest
of a kissthen moves his mouth down to hers Fora
we can see one of her eyes staring past him filling
expression of surprise
and then her face is lost to view as Coffey puts his

on hers We hear a soft whistling sound as he begins

the air deeply from her lungs Something hot and glowing
starts passing between them drawn on his breath

the waterglass on the nightstand douses the flames
Coffey keeps kissing Melinda in that deep and mysterious
inhaling and inhaling her hand held in his like a tiny
bird For a moment we actually hear something screaming
if some willful imp were being extracted by force

and then its over Coffey raises his head

Melindas beautiful face Her mouth no longer droops

is coming back to her hair Her skin is shining with

Coffey regards her raptly for a moment or two then
coughing violently

He turns away and drops to his knees hacking like a man
the last stages of tuberculosis

Paul and his men are expecting Coffey to spit out the
but he doesnt--he just keeps coughing deep and hard

finding time to snatch in the next breath of air

Hal goes to his wife beyond stunned sits at her side

looks back at him with amazement her face like a dirty
mirror thats been suddenly wiped clean
Johns coughing grows even worse Brutal drops to his
side
and slaps his broad spasming back

BRUTAL
John Sick it up Cough em out
like you done before

Coffey just keeps retching eyes watering from the
strain
spit flying from his mouth

BRUTAL
Hes choking Whatever he sucked
out of her hes choking on it

Paul starts toward them Coffey crawls away pressing
himself

into a corner with his face against the wallpaper Hes
still

making gruesome deep hacking sounds but getting it
under

control He weakly waves Paul off--let me be

Paul looks to the bed Hal sits with Melinda stroking
her
brow Color is blooming in her cheeks even as we watch

MELINDA
How did I get here We were going
to the hospital in Indianola
werent we We stopped and you
bought me a packet of posies

HAL
Shhh It doesnt matter It
doesnt matter anymore

MELINDA
Did I have the X-ray Did I

PAUL
Yes

They both look at him

PAUL
It was clear There was no tumor

Hal bursts into tears Melinda sits up comforting him
Her
eyes are drawn to the corner
MELINDA
Who is that man

Coffey is struggling to rise Brutal does his best to
help

She pushes the covers aside to rise Hal tries to stop
her

HAL
Melly no

but she pushes his hand gently aside Hal watches in
wonder as she stands takes a first tentative stepand
walks to Coffey She gazes up and touches his face

MELINDA
I dreamed of you I dreamed you
were wandering in the dark and so
was I We found each other We
found each other in the dark

She undoes her necklace holds it up for him He
hesitates

glances to Paul Paul nods--its all right Coffey
lowers his

head Melinda affixes the delicate chain around his
neck

MELINDA
Its St Christopher I want you
to have it Mr Coffey and wear
it Hell keep you safe Please
wear it for me

COFFEY
Thank you maam

MELINDA
Thank you John

Her arms go around his neck hugging him tightly as if

she
might never let go

Paul nods with weary resignation--yeah I know
ON THE MILE
Percy pauses near Coffeys cell careless as always

his holster buckled--and a massive black arm grabs him
through the bars His SCREAM brings Paul and the others

the restraint room

Coffeys face is pressed so tight between his bars it
like hes trying to push his head through He draws his
back baring his teeth in an awful sneer

Percy whacks him with his baton Coffey barely seems to

it He curls his free hand around the back of Percys

pulling him ever closer

and Percys screams are muffled as their mouths come
together Coffey begins exhaling as if hed held his

for hours Percy jerks like a fish on a hook but cant
away The men jump in try to pry Percy loose hollering
Coffey to let him go

The black insects are flowing from Coffey to Percy
swirling into his mouth up his nose down his throat

Several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and
the Mile Percys baton drops from his nerveless fingers
clatters to the floor never to be picked up again

And then Coffey steps back rubbing his mouth as if hes
tasted something bad The color has returned to his
asa

face

PAUL
Easy easy You all right

Percy says nothing He turns and walks slowly up the
his movements vacant and disjointed He comes to a
stop at Wild Bills celland turns slowly to look in
Wild Bill is coming painfully around groggily clutching
head He looks up see Percy
BILLY

Whata you looking at you limp

DEAN
Oh God oh God no

Percy is flat on his back staring up at nothing The
bugs come drifting out of nose and mouth swirling in

air over his head They turn white and disappear
The men are speechless Paul turns sees Coffey sitting

execution I mean Get Coffey a
new trial

PAUL
Based on what honey Some kind of
magical vision I had

JAN

Show this farmer--whats his name
Detterick--show him a picture of
Wild Bill

(off their looks)
Why not If Wharton was thereif
the farmer can identify his
picture and they know he was
there

BRUTAL
Him being there in May doesnt
mean he came back and killed those
girls in June Even if he was
committing other crimes

PAUL
They got their killer as far as
theyre concerned

Hell Coffeys own lawyer would
come throw the switch if we let
him

JAN
Then lie

PAUL
Lie About what

JAN

Tell them Wharton confessed to the
crime Brutus you can back him
up say you heard it too You can
say thats what set Percy off He
shot Wharton because he couldnt
stand thinking of what happened to
those two little girls it snapped
his mind

(seeing their looks)

DEAN
We never reported anything like
that We wouldve too everybody

BRUTAL
Besides confessing dont make it
so Slugs like Wild Bill lie about

JAN
But he was there He painted their
barn He ate dinner with them

The

firefly flits away vanishing through Coffeys tiny
window

COFFEY

words trying to make Paul understand

COFFEY

the road lonely as a sparrow in
the rain Tired of not ever having
me a buddy to be with or tell me
