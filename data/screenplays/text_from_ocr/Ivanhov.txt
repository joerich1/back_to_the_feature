ALASKA CHARACTER SIDES 2703 -- IVANHOV 1

INT IVANHOV’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Borough magistrate BILL IVANHOV is an artist of some
acclaim working in a very specialized niche He uses wood-
burning tools -- which look like soldering irons -- to create
elaborate images on knotted planks of pine

Mathers and Valerie stand near Ivanhov as he works tiny
curls of smoke rising from his canvas Ivanhov feels no need
to make eye contact

IVANHOV
People think a magistrate is just a
poor man’s judge but it’s
completely different Most of the
cases that come before me there’s
no prosecutor no defense attorney
just me and the perpetrator
figuring out the right thing to do

Ivanhov finally looks over at them He wears magnifying
glasses to aid his work

IVANHOV (cont’d)
Val will tell you I take my
responsibility to these people very
seriously

MATHERS
Good to know

IVANHOV
Which is why I will never give you
a warrant to search the Satchels’

He hangs his iron in the rack

VALERIE
He’s got good cause Bill

IVANHOV
He’s got nothing but an innocent
boy in jail grieving for the loss
of his only brother He hasn’t got
a shred of conclusive evidence
which is why he needs to turn the
Satchel home upside-down looking
for some nail on which to hang a
flimsy argument

Mathers doesn’t rise to the provocation
