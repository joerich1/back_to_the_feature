MICHELLES PLACE - INTERIOR DAY

Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste

box We see Michelles hand selecting a lipstick then we see
Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips seated in front

mirror of her dressing table She is dressed in a green

frock and

her face shows that she is quite disturbed
Her apartments decoration is very heavy with a lot of

various
useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors
She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe and get mad at
not
finding it She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions
which
she throws all around the place still madder at not finding
her
dress A cat who was lying on the armrest of the sofa runs
away
hurriedly from the mad Michelle

BILL CAPA OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

Large planes of ground glass We hear without understanding

some voices and laughs Then a male voice becomes more
understandable

BILLS VOICE
So who do you think is the enemy No no give me a
specific answer

then Michelle appears on the screen She is dressed in a
suit she is heavily made up et she still seems very
The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very
York psycho-analyst Beautiful and good taste furniture
with leather-bound books

MICHELLE
You are the goddamned enemy Capa you and this all tower
of psycho-babble You know what I hope That God gets real
pissed off and He shrivels up your cock so that it points
straight down to Hell where you belongs

During this reply Bill Capa has appeared on the screen He

seated He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt a necktie but no
jacket He laughs at Michelles last sentence

BILL
OK Michelle so you will become His Avenging Angel and
swoop down to finish me off
He stands up

MICHELLE
Now I finally get it youre are like my ex-husband You
think that everything got to be either black or white
because you got color-blind But God is on my side now He
knows Im not like you

BILL
Well we are pretty much the same Michelle We all do it

MICHELLE
We all do what

BILL
Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a
keyhole Is a very limited view of the truth So we have
to fill in the blanks We invent things

MICHELLE
I dont know what you mean

BILL
You invent enemies to test your strength against You
invent gods to protect you from these enemies

MICHELLE
Cutting him
What a depressing view of life you have that is such
horse-shit

BILL
Who is the enemy One minute you have friends the next
moment theyve slipped away You leave here and I wonder
who is Michelle really hating this week I try to remember
and I cant bring it to mind Do you know why

MICHELLE
No why dont you tell me

BILL
Take a look in the mirror Michelle

beginning of the scene Bill is lying on a couch

LARRY
Poor Capa Youre here for me to pity you

Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading It is the New

York

Post On the front page a title in large prints
«Patients
family sues Manhattan shrink»

BILL
Hell yes It doesnt take Sigmund Freud to figure out I
dont care to see the color of my patients blood

LARRY
Im a little surprised that this happened to you

BILL
Starts to stand up
Sure You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a
bitch

LARRY
Not really but there is a kind of arrogance here
Bill laughs
Do you really believe that youre responsible for her
illness You were a small recent part of her life

BILL
Yes thats right thats right But its all too fucking
glib for me Larry I cannot dispose of this woman that
easily

LARRY

Well you always were a romantic Are you involved with
anyone else

Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room Bill is
seated
on an armchair during the following reply and strokes the

grey
cat who is lying on the table
BILL
No I am still a romantic I just dont have anybody to be
romantic with They want to fuck me or marry me None of
them want to love me
LARRY
Maybe you dont want to be loved You had a happy marriage
once
BILL
She loved me to death Then she ran off and loved somebody
else to death
LARRY
Of course there is something else here To deny red is to
deny emotion
BILL
Oh yeah
LARRY
As you know that could be very dangerous
Bill stands up
BILL
Yes yes I know Very dangerous I know and I have got
something broken I know its gonna take some time to get
fixed
He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on
LARRY
Youre a pretty good therapist How long does it take a man
like you to forgive himself
BILL
I see you when I get back from Los Angeles
During the two last replies Bill has walked to the front
door

LARRY

if I could there is an issue of confidentiality

HECTOR
Confidentiality

BILL
Yes

HECTOR

He laughs and gets up

Youre talking to me about an issue of confidentiality

He sits down on the desk facing Bill
If a friend of mine got killed and the only thing between
the killer and me was Miranda you know what I will do

continue the treatment

HECTOR
He gets up We see his pistol hooked on the back of his
belt

thinking of a female

BILL

ROSE
I guess we have a lot in common

BILL
We seem to be playing the same game

His brother Dale thinks that your little baby should
be taken out of therapy

SONDRA

He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a
park
SONDRA
That Dale is a dangerous bastard

fq

BILL

But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal
Theres a big gap in Richies life up until about a year

She gets up
sniffing for blood on other peoples hands while

pretending to help your patients

BILL
You really think that I dont care about Richie

SONDRA
She gets upset
Richie wouldnt hurt a fly Why dont you take a look at
someone dangerous Why dont you take a look at someone who
could do it Why dont you take a look at Clark

BILL

SONDRA
She gets more and more upset
Clark Clark Clark is a sneaky lying button-down son
of a bitch who pretends to be this gentle creature I
heard him screaming one night at Bob It made the hairs on
my neck stand up Anyway I hope that they fry
whoever did it and it takes a really long time And
then And then a fuse blows They have to start all over
again
She sits back Bill has been listening to her outburst
without
reacting
We hear the front door chimes and Sondras expression
changes
immediately Her angry face becomes suddenly softer
She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips
Wow Thats my trainer
She gets up and sniffs a bit

DALES WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY
Bobs car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building

desert parking lot The building could be an old factory
reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture A

high chimney above the building
Bill dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt gets out of

car and walks toward the building He passes a board that
indicates the location of the «office» He knocks at a door

window and a grating and a sign that says «beware of the
dog starts barking Bill knocks again He tries to look

the door window The dog keeps on barking
Bill comes back the way he came toward the «office» He

DALES WORKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY

Entrance of the workshop The door opens and Bill appears
He

takes off his sunglasses puts them in the pocket of his
shirt and

The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit
dilapidated

On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted
«office»)

sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the
impression to

watch Bill

Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks

Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood

Bill looks around him looking a bit anxious Several men

are

working He approaches one of them wearing a sleeveless T-
shirt

and who is welding with a protection mask covering his
face

BILL
Excuse me

The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding He
raises his mask Its Dale

DALE

structure

BILL
Well thats the problem Dale I look at Richie and I
dont see that everything is fine I see a kid thats on

NIEDELMEYERS RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
Bill gets out of his car He is wearing light-colored pants
shirt and a very elegant leather jacket He walks up a few
steps

toward the house

He crosses the garden then reaches the very impressive
main door

of the house Above the door two similar faces are carved
in the

stone Probably Doctor Niedelmeyers face

A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyers
face

appears

BILL

his

Just a few questions Mrs Niedelmeyer

EDITH
Voice over through the door

Bill sighs then walks away from the door The camera moves
the door and ends up on a close-up of Niedelmeyers carved
who seems to sneer at Bill

BOBS OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Night is falling on LA Clark in the foreground is

books Behind him Richie Buck and Casey are seated Casey

books on the shelf somehow

BUCK

BUCK
Finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not
understandable
an emotional tar baby

BILL

Today Id like to focus on a most enlightening and
challenging topic
SONDRA
She is - a bit lasciviously - sprawled in her armchair
Sex

BILL
More or less You see the primary romantic relationship
in our life is often a symptom of our illness
He has seated himself in the hand-shaped armchair

CASEY
Glad I wore my rubber pants
Buck snickers

BILL
We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over
every time we choose a new mate So If you had a magic
wand if you uh had a wish list and could change
your partner Sondra how would you make them different
Whats wrong Whats missing

SONDRA
Now

BILL
You need a minute to think about it

CLARK
Shes totally forgot her Rolodex
Casey snickers
Sorry sorry

SONDRA
Well I dont have an attachment in my life right now The
last one sort of went to pieces If you enjoy sex A man

thinks youre doing it with everybody

BILL
He was jealous
He gets ups walks to a cupboard opens its door and takes a
cup

SONDRA
Thats right And I was as good as gold

BILL
Well theres a good chance that he was the one that was
sleeping around and projecting his fantasies and desires
onto you

SONDRA

This guy had a major projection and he couldnt keep it in
his pants
before

The whole group laughs Bill smiles while pouring himself a
coffee

SONDRA
Anyway I do have this girlfriend She really makes me
laugh A wish list I wish she was a guy

BILL

He comes back with his cup in his hand
Fair enough Casey what do you got for us
CASEY
He is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a
skull He waits a few seconds and puts the statue down

speaking

Well I met this girl about a month ago Ive painted
every inch of her in detail Shes the best model Ive ever
seen Completely uninhibited Does whatever I ask no matter
how

BUCK
He smiles
Ill bet she does

CASEY
Thats right Buck See but this is where the problem
comes in Its what you see beneath the skin when you
study somebody endlessly the way an artist does I see a
transcendental beauty there beyond anything I could
ever ever imagine

BILL
How does this woman feel about you

CASEY
She thinks Im the living end because Ive got talent But
I mean whats talent Kick a garbage can starving
artists crawl out right But theres only one unique
her And uh I think its love you know And um I

dont know what to do about that
He is suddenly moved on the verge of tears

BILL
Do you think she loves you

CASEY
No No

BILL
Do you care Casey

CASEY

BUCK
Hes a romantic He loves the suffering

CASEY
Maybe being who I am I have no choice

BILL

BUCK
He jumps
Oh nothing to talk about not compared to that

BILL

BUCK
He lights a cigarette
Hey Yard Sale you want to share the ashtray
Casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent Buck from

using it
Thanks a lot
He gets up
Forget it You want to share something share the ashtray
He sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray
on

it

I got something in my life something new You know shes
young Auburn hair 55 105 Pretty as hell I see her on
weekends
He picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more

comfortable

armchair

I dont think shed sleep with a man unless she was married
to him

BILL
He has taken his glasses off
Anything else youd like to tell us

BUCK
She doesnt mind the gray you know
Bill smiles
Shes fragile you know Its like shes running through
my fingers Two people I loved died I never thought that I
could feel anything
BILL

radiator grill

Third bumps Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road
downtown

The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars

honking
Without warning Bill turns on a side street on his right

gets honked by the other cars In spite of the very
driving of Bill among the other cars the red car keeps on
following him

To follow Bill the red car must take a vey sharp left

bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall

pavement
The chase goes on The red car is dented everywhere It

up with Bill overtakes him and bumps violently into Bills

right side
BILL

shopping items are scattered on the pavement The two car

again into each other and arrive into a main road
When the red car wants to hit Bills car again Bill stands

the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars
truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic The last
the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the
Bill barely avoids it Another car gets loose from the truck

causes a pile-up on the road
Bill zigzag out of the pile-up and comes to a crossing

railway A train is approaching The red car is still behind
Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway
starts moving backwards He hits the front of the red car

keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the
railway itself The train keeps on honking to move the cars

Hey You wanna die Huh You wanna die
We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake

looking to the red car with terror in his eyes
Just before the train reaches the crossing Bill jumps his

forward and the red car quickly moves backward
